Abstract. IHEP Protvino has pioneered the wide practical use of bent crystals as  optical  elements in
high-energy beams for beam extraction and deflection on permanent basis since 1989. In the course of
IHEP experiments, crystal channeling has been developed into efficient instrument for particle steering
at accelerators, working in predictable, reliable manner with beams of very high intensity over years.
Crystal  systems  extract  70  GeV  protons  from  IHEP  main  ring  with  efficiency  of  85%  at  intensity  of
1012, basing on multi-pass mechanism of channeling proposed theoretically and realised experimentally
at IHEP. Today, six locations on the IHEP 70-GeV main ring of the accelerator facility are equipped by
crystal extraction systems, serving mostly for routine applications rather than for research and allowing
a  simultaneous  run  of  several  particle  physics  experiments,  thus  significantly  enriching  the  IHEP
physics program. The long successful history of large-scale crystal exploitation at IHEP should help to
incorporate  channeling  crystals  into  accelerator  systems  worldwide  in  order  to  create  unique  systems
for  beam  delivery.  We  report  recent  results  from  the  research  and  exploitation  of  crystal  extraction
systems at IHEP.

1. Introduction
The idea to deflect proton beams using bent crystals, originally proposed by Edouard Tsyganov
in 1976 [1], was demonstrated shortly later, in 1979, by a Soviet-American team in Dubna on proton
beams  of  a  few  GeV  energy  [2].  In  the  following,  the  physics  of  bent  crystal  channeling  has  been
studied at many high energy labs; see e.g. refs. [3,4] for reviews.

Crystal-assisted extraction from accelerator was demonstrated for the first time in 1984 in Dubna
[5] at beam energies of 4-8 GeV and then tested at IHEP in Protvino starting from 1989 by exposing,
firstly,  a  silicon  crystal  bent  by  85  mrad  to  the  70  GeV  proton  beam  of  U-70  [6,7].  The  Protvino
experiment  eventually  pioneered  the  first  regular  application  of  crystals  for  beam  extraction:  the  Si
crystal, originally installed in the vacuum chamber of U-70, served without replacement over 10 years,
delivering  beam  for  particle  physicists  all  this  time.  However,  its  channeling  efficiency  was  a  small
fraction of percent.

In the 1990’s, an important milestone was obtained at the CERN SPS. Protons diffusing from a
120 GeV beam were extracted at an angle of 8.5 mrad with a bent silicon crystal. Efficiencies of ~10-
20%, orders of magnitude higher than the values achieved previously, were measured for the first time
[8-10].  The  extraction  studies  at  SPS  clarified  several  aspects  of  the  technique.  In  addition,  the
extraction  results  were  found  in  fair  agreement  with  Monte  Carlo  predictions  [8,11-13].  In  the  late
1990’s, another success came from the Tevatron extraction experiment where a crystal was channeling
a  900-GeV  proton  beam  with  an  efficiency  of  ~30%  [14-16].  The  simulation  [17]  predicted  the
efficiency  of  35%  for  a  realistic  crystal  in  the  Tevatron  experiment.  During  the  FNAL  test,  the  halo
created by beam-beam interaction in the periphery of the circulating beam was extracted from the beam
pipe without measurable effect on the background seen by the experimental detectors.

It was predicted [18,19] that efficiency of crystal channeling extraction can be boosted to much
higher values by multiple particle encounters with a shorter crystal installed in a circulating beam. The
existence  of  multi-pass  mechanism  was  confirmed  in  early  experiments  at  CERN  SPS  and  Tevatron
[9,15].  To  clarify  this  mechanism  a  new  experiment  was  started  at  IHEP  at  the  end  of  1997,  with
intention to test very short crystals and achieve very high efficiencies of extraction [20-22].

2. High efficiency channeling
In order to let the circulating particles encounter the crystal many times and suffer less scattering
and nuclear interactions in the crystal, one has to minimise the crystal length down to some limit set by
the physics of channeling in a strongly bent crystal [12]. This optimisation was studied in Monte Carlo
simulations in general and for the experiments at CERN SPS and the Tevatron [11-13,17], taking into
account the circulation of particle in the accelerator ring over many turns with multiple encounters with
a bent crystal. On every encounter with a crystal, particle is tracked through the curved crystal lattice
by the simulation (ab initio) code described in refs. [23-26]. The predictions of this code were earlier
successfully  tested  for  variety  of  channeling-related  phenomena  like  feed-out  [27]  and  feed-in  [28],
energy losses [29], and in particular for crystal extraction at CERN SPS [8,11,12], Tevatron [15], RHIC
[30-32], and IHEP U-70 [20-22,33-37].

Monte  Carlo  study  done  for  the  experiment  at  IHEP  has  predicted  [37]  that  a  crystal  can  be
shorten very much, down to ~1 mm along the 70-GeV beam in the extraction set-up of IHEP U-70. The
benefits from this optimisation were expected enormous: the crystal extraction efficiency could be as
high as over 90%.

IHEP measurements [-] for three types of crystal deflectors - O-shaped (circles), strips (triangles) and
quasi-mosaics (squares), - and earlier Monte Carlo prediction [21].

The  effect  of  shortening  the  crystal  on  the  efficiency  of  multi-turn  extraction  is  explained  by
Figure 1, where shown are both the predicted [37] dependence of the IHEP crystal extraction efficiency
as  a  function  of  the  crystal  length,  and  some  history  of  the  measurements  since  1997  [20-22,33-37].
Here,  two  very  fresh  and  very  interesting  experimental  points  (squares)  [38]  have  been  added  to  the

plot, obtained with a new bending technique of quasi-mosaic crystals. The shortest crystal used at IHEP
is now just 0.3 mm along the beam (!) still showing the efficiency of more than 80%. Notice that the
experimental data plotted is obtained with different bending angles in the range 0.5-2.3 mrad and the
predicted curve is for 0.9 mrad, so the plot is to show the global trend first of all. Some more detail on
crystal size and bending is given in Table 1.

Producing bent crystal deflectors of required size and curvature is not an easy task, moreover as one
takes into account that deflector has to be placed in a circulating beam and any extra disturbance to
halo particles must be avoided. Excellent crystalline deflectors used at IHEP were produced at IHEP
and PNPI in different approaches. In PNPI, the technique of "O"-shaped crystals of small size (Fig. 2)
was applied [20].  In IHEP, “strip” type of crystal deflector was invented (Fig. 2), beneficially using the
effect of anticlastic bending [33]. Some of the silicon wafers used for deflectors have undergone
chemical polishing treatment in Ferrara [39]. Three different “strip”-type crystals (bent in IHEP from
different silicon wafers) have demonstrated record 85% efficiency of channeling [33,39]. New
approaches to crystal bending are being studied.

     

Fig. 2 Two examples of IHEP crystals with bending schemes. Left: O-shaped crystal as used in IHEP
and RHIC. Right: Strip-type crystal used in IHEP.

The  experimentally  recorded  high  efficiency  followed  nicely  the  prediction  as  seen  in  Fig.  1.
Compared to the CERN SPS and Tevatron experiments, the efficiency is improved by a factor of 3-6
while the crystal size along the beam was reduced by a factor of 15-20 (from 30-40 mm to less than 2
mm).

Experimentally, the extraction efficiency was defined as the ratio of the extracted beam intensity
as measured in the external beam line to all the beam loss in the circulating beam.  Each measurement
included  the  statistics  from  several  hundred  machine  cycles.  A  remarkable  feature  of  the  IHEP
extraction is that the record high efficiency of about 85% is obtained even when the entire beam stored

3

in the ring is dumped onto the crystal. Typically, crystal channeled ~1012 protons (up to 3·1012 in some
runs) in a spill of 0.5-1 s duration.

crystal.  Measured  (solid  lines,  1)  on  two  locations  (a,  b)  in  the  U-70  ring  and  simulated  (dashed,  2).
Curve 3 is simulation for the same crystal installed closer to the orbit.

Figure  3  shows  how  the  efficiency  changed  versus  the  fraction  of  the  beam  store  used  in  the
channeling experiment. Two different locations on the U-70 ring were used in the data presented in Fig.
3, straight section 106 (Figure 3a) and block 22 (Figure 3b), and similar crystals (strip-type) employed.
Different slopes of the experimental dependences are due to the drift of the mean incident angle when a
beam is being dumped onto the crystal. The solid lines (1) in Fig. 3 a and b represent the measured data
while the dashed lines (2) are the Monte Carlo results for the absolute figure of efficiency of extraction
of 70 GeV protons on these two locations. The results of theory and experiment are in fair agreement.

Notice  that  the  experimental  figure  of  efficiency  attributes  all  the  observed  beam  losses  to  the
crystal  alone  while  actually  there  could  be  additional  losses  of  the  channeled  beam  when  it  is

4

transferred  along  the  accelerator  extraction  line,  for  instance  on  the  septum  magnet  partition  wall,
before the extracted beam is delivered to the external line where its intensity is measured and used for
evaluation of the extraction efficiency.

Further on in simulations for the location of block 22 we tried to optimize crystal radial position
with respect to the beam orbit and to the edge of the septum magnet downstream. With crystal installed
closer to the orbit, the efficiency might be improved further, as shows line (3) in Fig. 3b, and be about
90% with the same crystal.

  

Fig. 4 The radial beam profile observed 20 m downstream of the channeling crystal, at top energy (70
GeV,  left)  and  at  injection  plateau  (1.3  GeV,  right);  the  crystal  is  the  same.  The  major  peak  on  each
profile is channeled particles.

IHEP  has  many  locations  on  the  U-70  ring  where  crystals  are  installed  for  extraction  and
collimation studies. On two of these locations (dedicated for crystal collimation) the channeled beam is
not extracted from the ring but is intercepted by a collimator downstream. In a collimation experiment,
a bent crystal is positioned upstream of a secondary collimator (stainless steel absorber 4 cm wide, 18
cm  high,  250  cm  long)  and  closer  to  the  beam  in  the  horizontal  plane.  The  profilemeter  records  the
radial distribution of the particles incident on the entry face of the secondary collimator (Fig. 4). This
distribution includes the peak of channeled particles deflected into the depth of the collimator, and the
nonchanneled multiply scattered particles peaked at the edge of the collimator. The efficiency figures
as measured on the extraction set-up were reproduced on the collimation set-up where the intensity of
the  channeled  beam  is  obtained  by  integration  of  the  peak  in  the  profile.  This  set-up  allows  an
independent  check  of  the  crystal  channeling  efficiencies,  and  also  gives  opportunity  to  work  with
different bending angles unlike in the extraction set-up where crystal bending angles are more dictated
by the geometry of extraction.

The  channeling  experiment  was  repeated  at  the  injection  plateau  of  the  U-70,  with  1.3  GeV
protons,  on  the  same  collimation  set-up  with  the  same  crystal.  As  one  can  see  in  Figure  4  the
channeling effect is still quite profound although the energy was lowered by two orders of magnitude.

3. Crystal channeling at a ramping energy
In the recent IHEP experiment channeling was tested on the same crystal collimation set-up in a
broad  energy  range  made  available  in  the  main  ring  of  U-70  accelerator.  Earlier,  the  experiment  was
performed  at  the  top  energy  flattop,  70  GeV,  and  at  the  injection  flattop,  1.3  GeV,  of  U-70  machine.
This  time  the  tests  were  done  at  seven  intermediate  energies  and,  importantly,  it  was  not  possible  to
arrange  a  flattop  for  each  energy.  During  the  acceleration  part  of  the  machine  cycle,  on  a  certain
moment corresponding to the energy of the test, the beam was dumped in a short time onto the crystal.

These measurements are summarized in Figure 5 showing the ratio of the channeled particles to
the  entire  beam  dump  (crystal  channeling  efficiency)  as  measured  and  as  predicted  by  Monte  Carlo
simulation. Figure  6  shows  the  examples of the radial  beam  profile  observed  at  the  entry  face  of  the

5

collimator  with  crystal  working  at  12  GeV  and  at  45  GeV.  One  can  see  that  the  same  crystal  shows
efficient work from injection through the ramping up to the top energy.

3. Beam delivery to particle physics experiments

Crystal  bending  of  a  particle  beam  at  a  small  angle  (1-2  mrad)  is  not  sufficient  for  direct
extraction of particles out of the accelerator ring because the straight sections are short. Therefore, one
had to use several septum-magnets of the existing extraction system. As the main experimental set-ups
are  connected  to  this  extraction  system,  the  beam  extraction  by  means  of  crystal  could  be  used  for
carrying out a number of physical experiments. On different locations of the accelerator, three similar
crystal stations Si19, Si22 and Si106, were installed as shown in Fig. 7. Here, the index notes the number
of straight section or the number of magnet block where crystals are installed. Each station can ensure
the  extraction  of  proton  beam  towards  the  existing  extraction  line  provided  that  corresponding
combination of local orbit distortion is involved.

extracted towards the beamline № 8 and deflecting it at ~9 mrad towards the beamline № 22. Crystal
stations  Si84  and  Si86  are  situated  in  a  test  zone  and  are  dedicated  for  crystal  tests  before  their
installation into work stations Si19, Si22 and Si106, and also for channeling research, in particular for the
studies of beam collimation regimes using bent crystals.

4, 8, 14, 22, 23) indicate beamlines.

Let  us  look  at  the  chosen  schemes  of  extraction  closer.  Fig.  8  shows  several  schemes  used  for
beam  extraction.  In  the  first  scheme,  crystal  station  Si19  with  two  crystals  (one  of  them  spare)  is
installed in the straight section №  19.  It  provides  an  independent  translation  of  each  crystal  in  radial
plane  and  the  change  of  crystal  orientation.  The  circulating  beam  is  brought  to  the  crystal  by  the
method  of  local  beam  distortion  (magnet  blocks  №  15/21  and  №  16/22).  The  particles  impinging  on
crystal  and  trapped  into  channeling  mode  are  bent  by  crystal  at  ~  1.7÷2.5  mrad  (depending  on  the
bending angle of the crystal used) and enter the aperture of septum magnet OM20, avoiding the septum
partition wall. After bending in septum magnets OM22 and OM26 (curve 2 in Fig. 8), the particles exit
the accelerator vacuum chamber in straight section 30. This scheme is attractive also because it allowed
to  organize  a  simultaneous  extraction  of  beam  by  crystal  and  by  two  internal  targets  M24  and  M27
(curve 1 in Fig. 8).

text.

When  using  another  crystal  station  Si22,  positioned  in  the  middle  of  the  magnet  block  №  22,
proton extraction was realized through the septum magnets OM24 and OM26 (curve 3 on Fig. 8). In
this  case,  two  pairs  of  magnet  blocks:  20/26  and  18/30  are  used  to  bring  beam  onto  the  crystal.
Working with third station Si106, installed in the straight section № 106 (not shown in Fig. 8), also two
pairs of magnet blocks: 103/109 and 104/110 are used for beam steering onto crystal, and the extraction
was  realized  in  two  ways:  through  septum  magnets  OM20,  22  and  26,  and  through  septum  magnets
OM24 and OM26. Therefore, the third scheme can replace any of the first two ones in case of troubles.
Figure  9  illustrates  how  stable  is  the  work  of  our  crystal  extraction  system;  this  data  is  for
extraction at 50 GeV where crystal efficiency was 80% (a bit lower than at 70 GeV in the same set-up).
Figure  9a  shows  the  intensity  of  the  extracted  beam  per  cycle  during  180  cycles  as  measured  in  the
external  beamline.  Figure  9b  shows  the  efficiency  of  crystal  extraction  measured  for  each  cycle  of
those 180 ones. The system works stable enough at the intensity of the extracted beam of 1012 proton
per cycle. Our “strip” crystals worked in this regime over 3000 hours in recent accelerator runs.

Crystal-assisted extraction of protons allows in principle a simultaneous work of several internal
targets  as  confirmed  experimentally  in  1991  at  the  IHEP  U-70  accelerator  [40].  Realization  of  this
regime  with  use  of  short  crystals  opens  the  possibility  of  simultaneous  work  of  several  experimental
set-ups  during  all  the  flattop  of  the  accelerator  magnet  cycle,  which  leads  to  significant  economy.
Notice  that  a  classical  resonance  slow  extraction  is  not  compatible  with  a  parallel  work  of  internal
targets.  In  this  regime,  the  “Complex  of  Tagged  Neutrinos”  set-up  has  been  working.  This  physics
experiment  needed  a  high  intensity  of  extracted  beam  with  a  longest  possible  duration.  These
requirements could not be ensured earlier, before the use of crystal extraction regime. The experiment
studied  three-particle  decays:  К+  →  π  +  π  0  π  0  ,    K-  →  π  -  π  0  π  0.  As  the  yield  of  K+-mesons  is
significantly  higher  than  that  of  K--mesons,  with  a  change  of  regime  one  had  to  increase/reduce
proportionally the intensity of extracted proton beam.

Fig. 9 (b) Efficiency of crystal extraction measured for each cycle of 180 cycles.

One of most important parameters of extracted beams, from viewpoint of physics experiments, is
the time structure of beam or effective time of extraction. In the course of experiment, minimal change
of  the  particle  rate  is  preferred.  In  the  considered  regime,  the  time  structure  was  suitable  for  all
simultaneously working experimental set-ups. The effective time of extraction here reached 98%. The
characteristics  of  crystal  delivered  beams  satisfied  the  physicists  over  such  a  range  of  parameters  as
intensity, duration, beam quality, beam size on a target.

One peculiarity of crystal work in parallel to internal targets is the significant increase in the size
of  the  circulating  beam  due  to  scattering  on  internal  targets.  This  effect  leads  to  existence  of  two
mechanisms that bring particles to crystals. One is local beam distortion. Another one is the scattering
on  internal  targets.  This  latter  mechanism  we  used  for  crystal  extraction  of  low-intensity  beam.  The
uniform time structure of extraction was defined by uniform dump of the circulating beam on internal
targets. Here, the intensity of the channeled beam reached 106 proton/cycle.

The crystal-assisted extraction scheme developed and invented at our accelerator opens way for
further  modifications.  In  particular,  in  order  to  increase  the  number  of  experiments  simultaneously
carried  out  at  U-70  accelerator  we  installed  in  the  straight  section  30  another  station  of  crystal
deflectors  with  a  crystal  bent  9  mrad  in  the  direction  of  beamline  22.  This  crystal  deflected  a  small
fraction (~107 proton/cycle) of the beam already extracted towards the beamline 23 and delivered this
fraction to another set-up situated on beamline 23.

As the result of introducing this regime, we managed to increase the number of experimental set-
ups working simultaneously during the flattop of magnet cycle up to five, without taking into account
9

the possibility of a parallel “shadow” work of yet another two internal targets. This scheme of work is
most efficient when the main experimental set-ups do not plan essential changes of the regime. In the
perspective of work with 50 GeV proton beam, a possibility appears to increase the flattop duration to 4
s.  In  this  case,  the  application  of  the  developed  crystal  extraction  schemes  seems  most  adequate  and
efficient. The first such experiment was carried out in 2003. In this experiment, done at 50 GeV, crystal
extraction with duration of 3.2 s was obtained.

The considered regimes of extraction system with assistance of bent crystals essentially increase
the number of simultaneously working experimental set-ups and improve their data-taking rate thanks
to the increase in duration and intensity of the extracted beam. Since 1999, the use of bent crystals for
ensuring the high energy physics program became regular in all accelerator runs of U-70. About one
half  of  all  extracted  beams  with  intensities  up  to  1012  at  IHEP  are  now  obtained  with  channeling
crystals.

4. Conclusion
The IHEP Protvino 70 GeV accelerator facility is largely “crystallized” and became a “fabric” of
channeled  beams.  Thanks  to  crystals,  up  to  five  physics  experiments  can  be  run  simultaneously  at
IHEP. Crystal extraction efficiency of 85% is routinely obtained for a beam of 1012 protons at 70 GeV;
three  different  crystals  of  the  same  size  and  geometry  have  shown  the  same  efficiency,  in  excellent
agreement with Monte Carlo prediction from first principles. The same crystal works efficiently over
full  energy  range,  from  injection  flattop  through  ramping  up  to  top  energy  plateau,  as  demonstrated
experimentally from 1 through 70 GeV. At the above said intensity, there were no problems with high
intensity or lifetime of a crystal. One of the crystals has served for extraction over 10 years, from 1989
to 1999, without replacement. Many types of deflectors were tested and found successful. We presently
work on bringing the regular intensity of channeled beams up to 1013  per spill.

The reported experience of IHEP makes a strong case for application of crystal-based technique
worldwide.  One  opportunity  is  crystal  steering  of  a  Large  Hadron  Collider  beam  [41-43]  with  the
purpose  of  collimation  or  extraction,  where  crystal  should  be  very  efficient  according  to  simulations
[25,41]. Our Monte Carlo model successfully predicts crystal work in the circulating beam, as observed
in crystal extraction experiments at IHEP, CERN SPS, RHIC, and Tevatron at energies up to 900 GeV.
Crystal channeling deflection, extraction and collimation are now established beam instruments.

Photonic  crystals  are  dielectric  materials  that  exhibit  bandgaps  in  which  EM  waves 

propagation  in  the  bandgaps  are  forbidden.[1]      To  achieve  photonic  crystals  with  complete 

bandgaps has been challenging to both theorists and experimentalists.[1,2]  Among the various 

structures  that  supports  complete  photonic  band  gaps,  the  diamond  and  the  related  woodpile 

structures stand out with wide and robust bandgaps even with a moderate dielectric contrast.[2]  

Various  techniques,  including  the  self-assembly  or  nano-manipulation  of  colloidal  micro-

spheres,[3,4] the layer by layer micro-fabrications,[5] and recently, the holographic lithography[6-

8]  and  the  multi-photon  direct  laser  writing,[9]   have  been  used  to  fabricate  photonic  crystals.  

However, not all techniques are suitable for the woodpile/diamond structure.  For example, the 

self-assembly  method  was  limited  to  face-centered-cubic  (FCC)  or  close-packed  structures.[3]  

Recently, micro-manipulation has been used to fabricate the diamond structure.[4]   However, 

the sample size is limited to a few unit cells and the process is very tedious.  The layer by layer 

and  the  multi-photon  direct  laser  writing  techniques  had  been  used  to  fabricate  the  woodpile 

structure with bandgaps in the infrared range.[5,9]  However, it was limited to a few layers in the 

first case, and was tedious for both due to the demanding precisions and procedures.[5,9]  The 

holographic  lithography,  a  method  combining  the  techniques  of  multiple  beams  interference 

and photolithography to record the interference pattern in photo-resist, provides some unique 

 

1

advantages.  For example, it requires only simple experimental setups, and more importantly, 

various  structures  (e.g.  quasi-periodic[7]  and  chiral  structures[8])  are  feasible  by  varying  the 

beam  orientations  and  polarizations.    This  method  has  thus  attracted  much  interest  since  the 

realization  of  the  FCC  structure  using  the  interference  of  four  non-planar  coherent  beams.[6]  

Furthermore  a  double-exposure  holographic  lithography  had  also  been  used  to  fabricate  the 

woodpile structure in the infrared range.[10]  Recently, several groups have suggested that the 

diamond  structure  could  be  fabricated  using  4-beam  configurations.[11-14]    However,  these 

configurations require either impractical beam arrangements or elliptical polarizations that are 

hard  to  implement  experimentally.[11-14]    A  recent  attempt  to  fabricate  the  diamond  structure 

using  a  (3+1)-beam  configuration  (3  linear  polarized  side  beams  and  one  circular  polarized 

central  beam),  to  simulate  the  double  exposures  for  two  FCC  structures,  was  debatable.[16,17]   

One  of  us  has  proposed  recently  that  the  woodpile  and  diamond  structures  can  be  obtained 

using a 5-beam optical interference holography that is accessible experimentally all the beams 

are  from  the  same  half  space  as  compared  to  other  configurations  in  which  the  interfering 

beams are counter-propagating from both half spaces.[17]  In this communication, we report the 

use  of  a  (4+1)-beam  interference  configuration  to  fabricate  the  woodpile  structure  in  photo-

resist  using  one  single  exposure.    The  configuration  is  basically  the  “umbrella”  arrangement 

with 4 linear polarized side beams arranged symmetrically around a circular polarized central 

beam.[17] The fabricated woodpile structures, in submicron scales, are in good agreement with 

model simulations.  Furthermore, they also exhibit directional bandgaps in the visible range. 

 

The  wave  vectors  of  the  beams  for  the  woodpile  structure  as  shown  in  Fig.  1(a)  can  be

superposition  of  orthogonal  x-  and  y-  directional  rods  stacked  and  interlaced  with  half  rod-

space  shift  in  each  plane.    The    x-  and  y-  rods  are  obtained  by  the  interference  of  beams

,  respectively.      The  rod  spacings  (a  for  x-  and  b  for  y-  rods  as 

shown in Fig. 1(b)) and the shape of the rods depend on the angle ϕ.  For diamond symmetry, 

the lattice ratio a/b is equal to 

2/1

, corresponding to ϕ = 70.53o.   Figures 1(c) and (d) show 

woodpile structures as intensity contour surfaces obtained by Eqs. 1 and 2 for all beams with 

the same phases (δ’s =0) and one beam 180o out of phase (e.g. δ2= 180o and others are zero).  

To compare with the experimental results, the structures are simulated using the experimental 

incidence angle ϕ = 41.8o taking the ~40% shrinkage in the z-direction and ~10% expansion in 

the  xy-directions  into  account  to  achieve  the  diamond  symmetry.    One  obvious  difference 

between  Figs.  1(c)  and  (d)  is  that  the  x-  and  y-  rods  in  Fig.  1(c)  are  correctly  stacked  and 

interlaced while they occupy the same z-position in each plane for the incorrect phase case as 

shown in Fig. 1(d).  The top views (upper-right insets in Figs. 1(c) and (d)) further demonstrate 

the stacking of the rods in both cases.  The lower-right inset of Fig. 1(c) obtained at a higher 

intensity cut-off, shows clearly a diamond structure for the correct phase configuration while 

 

3

the corresponding inset in Fig. 1(d) shows a FCC structure interlaced with z-directional rods in 

between.  For higher intensity cut-offs, the z-rods will disappear giving only a FCC structure.  

Fortunately, good woodpile/diamond structure can still be obtained for small phase difference 

as  confirmed  by  200  realizations  of  random-phase  simulations  within  which  more  than  50% 

still show visually discernible woodpile structure. 

 

The  realization  of  the  woodpile  structure  was  carried  out  by  using  a  5-beam  holographic 

lithography  technique  on  a  photo-resist.    Figure  2(a)  shows  an  SEM  image  of  a  sample 

fabricated  as  described  in  the  experimental  section.    The  sample  consists  of  more  than  20 

layers of rods resemble strikingly to that obtained from the model.    We found that the samples 

had  shrank/collapsed  substantially,  ~40%,  in  the  z-direction  while  there  was  about  a  10% 

change in the xy-directions.  The shrinkage was anticipated from past experience and was the 

main reason we selected a smaller incident angle instead of the expected angle ϕ = 70.53o for 

the  diamond  structure.[7,8]    Figures  2(b)  and  (c)  show  woodpile  structures  with  lattice  ratio 

(obtained  from  the  front  view  insets)  a/b  =  0.72  and  0.88.    They  look  very  similar  to  that 

obtained  by  the  multi-photon  direct  laser  writing  technique.[9]    The  main  advantage  of  our 

method is that it takes much shorter time than that used in the direct laser writing technique.  In 

addition, large samples of a few mm can be fabricated even though uniform regions with the 

correct phases are small due to inhomogeneities in the optics.  Note that Fig. 2(b) is very close 

to the diamond symmetry within experimental uncertainty while Fig. 2(c) differs slightly by a 

larger shrinkage in both the x- and y- directions than those in Fig. 2(b).  Figure 2(d) shows an 

example with lattice ratio a/b = 0.82 for the most unfavourable phases for the diamond lattice.  

It is clear that the x- and y- rods are all in the same plane at each layer, resembling closely to 

Fig. 1(d).   The front view inset of Fig. 2(d) shows clearly the different stacking as compared to 

the samples with the correct phases as shown in the front view insets of Figs. 2(b) and (c).  The 

agreement between the model the experiment can also been seen from the top view (lower-left) 

 

4

insets of Figs. 2(b)-(d) and the upper-right insets of Fig. 1(c)-(d) for both the correct (Figs. 1(c) 

and 2(b)-(c)) and incorrect (Figs. 1(d) and 2(d)) phases. 

  Despite  the  differences  in  the  rod  stacking,  all  samples  possess  visible  range  directional 

bandgaps  in  the  normal  reflectance  and  transmittance  measured  as  described  in  the 

experimental section and shown in Figs. 3(a)-(c), corresponding to Figs. 2(b)-(c) respectively.  

There is a bandgap around 700 nm, shifting slightly to longer wavelength, for the correct rod 

stacking samples in Figs. 2(b)-(c) respectively.  Despite the incorrect stacking in Fig. 2(d), the 

bandgap is also ~ 700nm suggesting that either our samples are not good enough or the normal 

incident is not sensitive enough to distinguish the difference.  Unfortunately, our samples do 

not have uniform regions large enough for obtaining reliable angular dependent measurements 

and to warrant a quantitative comparison with calculations.     

 

To conclude, we have fabricated the woodpile structure on photo-resist using a (4+1) beam 

optical  interference  holography.    The  samples  resemble  the  simulations  very  well.    By 

exploiting  the  shrinkage  of  the  photo-resist,  samples  with  the  diamond  lattice  spacing  is 

obtained.    The  woodpile  structures  display  visible  range  directional  bandgaps.    Our  samples, 

although  small  in  size  and  have  low  dielectric  contrast,  could  be  used  as  template  for 

fabricating woodpile structures with higher dielectric contrast for complete bandgaps.    

 

Experimental 

The  five  beams,  7.5  mm  diameter,  in  Fig.  1(a)  were  obtained  by  passing  an  expanded  beam 

from an argon ion laser through a template with one central hole and four side holes distributed 

evenly around the central hole. The beams, power 4.5 mW each and polarizations adjusted by 

wave plates mounted at the holes of the template entered a four-sided truncated pyramid from 

the base as shown in Fig. 1(a).  The central beam, converted to circular polarized by a quarter 

wave  plate,  went  straight  up  the  pyramid  while  the  side  beams  reflected  internally  at  the 

slanted  surfaces  and  intersect  at  the  truncated  surface  making  an  angle  ϕ =  41.8o  with  the 

 

5

central beam as shown in Fig. 1(a).  Using this setup, the beams were more uniform and, most 

importantly,  the  phases  of  the  beams  were  fixed  because  they  were  obtained  from  the  same 

expanded beam.  We used the photo-resist “SU8” (from Shell) as the raw polymer resin and 

followed the procedures reported earlier.[7,8]  The resin was spin-coated on glass substrates with 

almost the same refractive index as the SU8 to form ~20 µm thick samples.  The samples were 

heated  to  90oC  to  remove  any  solvent  left  before  exposure.    The  photo-resist  coated  sample 

was  placed  on  the  truncated  surface  of  the  pyramid  with  index-matching  to  reduce  multiple 

reflections.  The exposure time was 15 s.  After the exposure, a post-thermal treatment at 90oC 

for about 30 mins was needed to complete the polymerization.  Polymerization occurred only 

at  regions  where  the  dosage  exceeded  a  critical  value,  while  under-exposed  regions  were 

washed  away  first  by  bathing  the  sample  with  propylene-glycol-methyl-ether-acetate 

(PGMEA)  for  8  hours,  then  rinsed  with  PGMEA-acetone  solution,  and  finally  with  ethanol, 

creating a copy of the woodpile pattern.  We obtained the normal reflection and transmission 

spectra  by  using  an  optical  microscope  coupled  to  a  spectrometer  (Oriel  Cornerstone  260) 

through an optical fiber as reported recently.[7]  The microscope, with a pin hole installed in the 

optical path, could be focused down to a size of 15 µm using a 100X objective.  Reflectance 

and transmittance were normalized against backgrounds of silver mirror reflection and empty 

air transmission, respectively.  SEM images were obtained by using a JEOL 6300F scanning

Abstract 

We studied the effect of additive and multiplicative noises on the growth of a tumor based on a 
logistic growth model. The steady-state probability distribution and the average population of the 
tumor cells were given to explain the important roles of correlated noises in the tumor growth. We 
found that multiplicative noise induces a phase transition of the tumor growth from an uni-stable 
state  to  a  bi-stable  state;  the  relationship  between  the  intensity  of  multiplicative  noise  and  the 
population  of  the  tumor  cells  showed  a  stochastic  resonance-like  characteristic.  It  was  also 
confirmed  that  additive  noise  weakened  rather  than  extinguish  the  tumor  growth.  Homologous 
noises, however, promote the growth of a tumor. We also discussed about the relationship between 
the tumor treatment and the model.

1. Introduction 
        Nonlinear Physics has changed people's views of world drastically in the past half a century 
(Nicolis and Prigogine 1977) and it is expected useful for discovering the complexity of Biology 
(Nicolis  and  Prigogine  1986;  Dean  et  al  1997;  Russell  et  al  1999).  More  and  more  attempts 
confirmed the important role of noise in the nonlinear dynamic systems (Gammaitoni et al 1998; 
Anishchenko  et  al  2002).  Especially,  Fokker-Planck  equation  became  one  of  the  approaches  of 
nonlinear dynamics based on deterministic equation with the stochastic form (Gardiner 1983; Hu 
1994).  During  the  last  twenty  years,  bistable-state  model  is  one  of  those  that  attract  Physicists 
most (Gammaitoni et al 1998). 
        For many years, exploring the growth law of tumors is a challenging subject. Mathematical 
models are always used as a tentative for describing the tumor growth (Verhulst 1845; Banks 1994; 
Qi and Du 1998; Scalerandi and Sansone 2002; Murray 2002). Bru et al (2003, 2004) discovered 
that tumor growth was largely governed by environmental pressures (host tissue pressure, immune 
response,  etc.)  through  both  simulations  and  experiments  of  the  immune  responses  of  mice. 
Chemotherapeutic double-faces effect on the cancer was studied by Ferreira et al (2003). It was 
confirmed that the environment like chemotherapy affected the growth of cancer vitally. Recently, 
Ai  et  al  (2003)  applied  Logistic  growth  model  to  analyze  the  growth  of  tumors  driven  by 
correlated noises. The relationship between correlated noises and tumor growth was mentioned for 
the first time. For simplicity, Ai et al only investigated the influence of multiplicative noise on the 
growth rate of tumors. They found that additive and multiplicative noises would lead the tumors to 
extinction.  They,  however,  only  performed  a  qualitative  analysis  according  to  the  steady-state 
probability distribution of tumor cells. It is unclear whether the influence of correlated noises on a

tumor is always negative. 
        Tumor  growth  is  a  complex  process.  The  search  based  on  tumor  growth  dynamics  for  the 
underlying mechanisms of the tumor development and progression might focus on lots of factors. 
On  one  hand,  the  environmental  factors,  like  temperature,  chemotherapy  and  radiotherapy,  may 
affect  the  decay  rate  as  well  as  the  growth  rate;  on  the  other  hand,  intrinsic  elements,  like 
emigration and genetic instability, also will influence the growth of tumor cells strongly (Sole and 
Deisboeck 2004). The environmental factors were regarded as the sources of multiplicative noise, 
while the intrinsic elements as the additive ones. Considering the fluctuation of the linear growth 
rate under a stable carrying capacity of environment, we studied the influence of the intensities of 
correlated  noises  on  the  growth  and  decay  of  tumor  cells.  Stochastic  resonance  (SR)  is  another 
concern of this paper. Generally, bistable state is one of the conditions for SR (Gammaitoni et al 
1998).  However,  the  Logistic  model,  a  non-bistable  state  system  driven  by  correlated  noises  as 
showed  in  this  paper,  also  shows  a  typical  SR-like  characteristic.  It  is  of  interest  to  study  this 
phenomenon  as  well  as  its  underlying  mechanism.  We  attempt  to  bridge  the  gap  between 
correlated noises and tumor treatment and give a new, helpful concept for the treatment of cancer. 
 
2. Langevin equation and Fokker-Planck Equation 
        Verhulst [28] proposed a single-species model with a self-limiting process. He suggested

)1(

 

        This  is  the  Logistic  growth  equation,  where  x  is  the  population;  r  and  K  are  the  linear  per 
capita  birth  rate  and  the  carrying  capacity  of  the  environment,  respectively.  Eq.(1)  was  used  to 
study the growth of the cells. When the fluctuations of the environment, such as radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy,  were  considered,  the  linear  internal  growth  rate  of  tumor  cell,  r,  would  not  be  a 
constant any more. Therefore, it is reasonable to introduce noise ξ(t) into the single-species model, 
and r should be rewritten as r+ξ(t). Likewise, intrinsic factors were set as another noise η(t), e.g. 
emigration, selection pressure and genetic instability, which could affect the population of tumor 
cells in local area. So if x was defined as the population of tumor cells, the Langevin differential 
equation driven by correlated noises could be written as

in  which 〈x〉  and 〈δx²〉  refer  to  the  average  population  of  tumor  cells  and  its  square  difference, 

respectively.  Increasing  〈x〉  means  the  growing  of  the  tumor  cells,  otherwise  the  decaying. 

Augment of 〈δx²〉 denotes that the tumor growth is unstable, otherwise it is stable. 
 
3. Analysis of the growth model of a tumor 
        Whether a tumor come into being depends on the linear growth rate, r, in Eq.(1). If r and K 
are positive, e.g. 0.2 and 6 respectively, the tumors will grow; else if r and K are negative, e.g. -0.2, 
-6, the tumors will decay. The noises induce different responses of tumor cells between the growth 
and decay case. 
 
A. Growth Case 
        The influence of additive noise on the growth of a tumor is shown in Fig.1. In the absence of 
noises,  pst(x)=δ(x-K),  tumors  population  is  stable  at  x=K.  In  the  presence  of  noises,  a  STPD 
appears with its peak at the position x=K (see Fig.1). As the intensity of the noise increases, the 
peak  of  STPD  decreases.  When  D<0.2,  the  population  of  tumor  cells  decreases  firstly  and  then 
increases  with  the  intensity  of  additive  noise,  showing  a  negative  stochastic  resonance-like 
characteristic.  When  D>0.2,  the  stochastic  resonance-like  characteristic  extincts  (see  Inset  in 
Fig.1). 
 

Fig.1 The dependence of the STPD on the tumor cells population, the parameters of noises are λ=0.0, and D=0.5 

respectively. Inset: the average population varies with the intensity of additive noise, from top to bottom, D is 0.20, 

0.08 and 0.02, respectively. 

 
        In  addition  to  that  of  the  additive  noise,  the  influence  of  noises  correlation  on  the  tumor 
growth was also studied. The STPD, as shown in Fig.2, increases with the correlation parameter, λ. 
This  implies  that  the  homologous  noises  promote  the  stable  growth  of  tumor  cells.  Inset  shows 
increasing λ is of benefit to tumor growth in the case of low noise intensity; contrarily, increasing 
λ  is  unfavorable  to  the  survival  of  tumor  cells.  λ  has  little  effect  on  the  tumors  at  intermediate 
intensity.

Fig.2 STPD under different correlations of noises, the noise parameters are D=0.5 and Q=2.0. Inset: the average 

population varies with the strength of correlation. 

 
        Unlike the additive noise, multiplicative noise has an interesting influence on tumor growth. 
Figure 3 clearly describes a STPD transition from an uni-peak to a bi-peak distribution with the 
noise intensity. Moreover, the stochastic resonance induced by multiplicative noise is also given. 

In Fig.4, 〈x〉 increases firstly and then decreases with the intensity of multiplicative noise, showing 

a typical stochastic resonance characteristic. This means an appropriate intensity of multiplicative 
noise  is  suitable  for  tumor  cells,  and  extra  noise  restrains  tumor  growth,  even  leads  them  to 
extinction.  Figure  5  illustrates  the  influence  of  noises  correlation  on  the  stochastic  resonance 

induced by multiplicative noise. When λ>0.8, the stochastic resonance peak will degenerate and 

disappear. The inset of Fig.5 displays the position Dpeak, the peak of 〈x〉, increases exponentially 

with the parameter, λ.

B. Decay Case 
        In  the  decay  case,  the  influence  of  noise  intensity  and  correlation  on  the  tumors  growth  is 
shown in Fig.6-8. Similar to the growth case, in the absence of noises, pst(x)=δ(x-0), tumors could 
not  grow.  After  introducing  noises,  one  could  find  that  some  tumor  cells  are  still  alive.  As 

indicated  schematically  in  Fig.6,  the  peak  of  STPD  drops  and 〈δx²〉  increases  with  the  additive 

noise intensity. This is in agreement with the results of Fig.1 that additive noise always causes an 
unstable growth of tumor cells. Different from that of the growth case, the noises correlation has 
little effect on the STPD of tumor growth in the decay case (see Fig.7). However, inset of Fig.7 
depicts that the population of tumor cells still increase with the strength of the noises correlation. 
This denotes that strong correlation would keep the tumor far from extinction. In addition, just like 
that in the growth case, multiplicative noise also induces a stochastic resonance in the decay case. 
Figure  8  shows  that  the  peak  of  STPD  increases  firstly  and  then  decrease  with  the  intensity  of 

multiplicative noise. There is shown in the inset that the average population of cells, 〈x〉, and the 

peak of STPD at x=0, pst(0), change with D. It is also a stochastic resonance-like characteristic in 
the decay case (see the inset of Fig.8).

4. Discussion 
        Tumor growth was largely governed by their intrinsic elements and the environmental factors 
like  tumor  treatment,  which  was  supported  through  simulations  or  experiments  (Bru  et  al  2003, 
2004;  Ferreira  et  al  2003;  Ai  et  al  2003).  Ferreira  et  al  (2003)  considered  two  kinds  of 
selection-inducing therapeutic strategies, namely, those that kill tumor cells and those that block 
cell  mitosis  but  allowed  the  cell  to  survive  for  some  time.  These  therapeutic  strategies  were 
regarded as the external multiplicative noise in our model.

Fig.8  STPD  under  different  multiplicative  noise intensities  at λ=0.0,  Q=1.6.  Inset:  the  varieties  of 〈x〉  and  pst(0) 

with D. 

 
        There should be a close relationship between the noises and tumor treatment. Firstly, tumor 
treatments  could  cause  the  fluctuation  of  the  tumor  cells  population.  The  intensity  of 
multiplicative noise is analogous to the treatment, e.g. the medicinal dose in chemotherapy and the 
intensity  of  the  ray  in  radiotherapy.  Secondly,  the  tumor  cells  themselves  transferred  from  one 
place to the other ceaselessly to survive or encroach. This caused another fluctuation of the tumor 
cells. This noise roots in the genetic instability of the tumor cells themselves, so it is internal noise, 
i.e.  additive  noise.  The  intensity  of  additive  noise  is  considered  as  instability  of  tumor  cells 
population, e.g. genetic instability and cancer heterogeneity. Thirdly, the correlation between two 
noises reflected the adaptation of a tumor to the treatments. If λ=0.0, the tumor was completely 
unconformable,  and  if  λ=1.0,  the  tumor  had  better  adjustability.  Our  model  did  not  refer  to  a 
certain therapy, but emphasized particularly on the response of a tumor to the treatment. 
        Additive noise induces an unstable tumor growth, but does not cause extinction. This perhaps 
owes  to  the  genetic  instability  and  emigration  of  tumor  cells,  which  adjust  themselves  to  the 
environment.  Furthermore,  Multiplicative  noise  induces  a  phase  transition  and  stochastic 
resonance.  Firstly,  multiplicative  noise  leads  the  tumor  growth  from  an  uni-stable  state  to  a 
bi-stable  state.  This  transition  denoted  the  tumor  try  to  survive  at  the  price  of  partial  death.  In 

addition, it was confirmed that tumors grow firstly and then decrease with the enhancement of the 
treatment. This stochastic resonance-like characteristic implied an improper therapeutic intension 
could  not  kill  the  tumors,  but  lead  to  their  malignant  growth.  It  was  suggested  that  an 
enough-strong intensity of therapy was necessary for tumor treatment. Unfortunately, the normal 
cells were at the risk of canceration at the same time. These presumptions implicated a dilemma 
for  some  kinds  of  therapies  like  radiotherapy  and  chemotherapy.  Therefore,  provided  that  some 
advanced  treatments  based  on  repeated  applications  were  designed,  better  treatments  would  be 
expected. 
        It  was  well  known  that  almost  all  solid  cancers  were  composed  of  various  genetically  and 
epigenetically  more  or  less  different,  clonal  cell  sub-populations.  This  cancer  heterogeneity 
referred to the fluctuation of tumor cells population as well as a better adaptation of the tumor to 
the therapies, namely, the additive noise and the correlation of noises. These dual factors focused 
on an extreme condition, i.e. strong noise with close correlation. Tumor cells population, however, 
increases  steadily  under  this  extreme  condition  (see  inset  of  Fig.2).  This  implicated  cancer 
heterogeneity  was  disadvantageous  to  cancer  curing.  It  is  one  of  the  challenges  in  modern 
anti-cancer therapy to apply therapeutic strategies to keep up with the tumor's intrinsic capability 
to adapt. 
        The  decay  case  was  described  as  tumor's  decreasing  under  immune  surveillance,  which 
caused  a  tumor  to  decay.  In  this  case,  additive  noise  still  played  a  role  of  destroyer  like  in  the 
growth case, and kept tumor cells far from extinction. Weak multiplicative noise may stabilize the 
tumor  growth,  but  strong  multiplicative  noise  accelerated  their  extinctions.  However,  the  noises 
correlation  had  little  effect  on  the  tumor  growth  law.  These  meant  that  strong-enough  treatment 
and  the  attempts  of  different  therapies  were  still  necessary  for  cancer  curing  even  if  there  exist 
immune systems. 
        Anyway,  tumor  treatment  includes  kinds  of  complex  processes,  such  as  therapy,  immune 
response,  medicine,  and  so  on.  Pure  therapy  just  like  chemotherapy  or  radiotherapy  has  both 
negative  and  positive  effects  on  the  tumors.  It  was  suggested  in  that  more  measures  should  be 
taken in tumor treatment to eliminate a tumor completely, such as gene-therapy, immunotherapy, 
resection, and so on. 
 
5. Conclusion 
        We presumed two kinds of noises in the tumor growth model. One originates from the tumor 
treatment, like radiotherapy and chemotherapy; the other root in the tumor cells. The previous is 
multiplicative,  and  the  latter  is  additive.  On  one  hand,  multiplicative  noises  induce  a  phase 
transition and stochastic resonance in the tumor growth. An appropriate intensity of multiplicative 
noise, e.g. an error treatment, could not kill a tumor, but activated it. On the other hand, additive 
noises cause an unstable growth of a tumor, but does not extinct it. Under a weak multiplicative 
noise, an additive noise also induces a negative stochastic resonance. In addition, close correlation 
between multiplicative and additive noises, i.e. a better adjustability of a tumor to the environment,

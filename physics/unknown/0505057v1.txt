The absorption of acoustic wave propagation in a broad variety of lossy media is characterized 

by an empirical power law function of frequency, 

. It has long been noted that exponent y 

yωα0

ranges  from  0  to  2  for  diverse  media.  Recently,  the  present  author10  developed  a  fractional 

Laplacian  wave  equation  to  accurately  model  the  power  law  dissipation,  which  can  be  further 

reduced to the fractional Laplacian diffusion equation. The latter is known underlying the Lévy 

stable distribution theory. Consequently, the parameters y is found to be the Lévy stability index, 

which  is  known  bounded  within  0<y≤2.  This  finding  first  provides  a  theoretical  explanation  of 

empirical  observations  y∈[0,2].  Statistically,  the  frequency-dependent  absorption  can  thus  be 

understood  a  Lévy  stable  process,  where  the  parameter  y  describes  the  fractal  nature  of 

attenuative media.

of frequency is typically characterized by a measured power law function of frequency

derivatives of integer orders can not accurately reflect power law function (1) except for two 

extreme  cases:  y=0,2.  Unfortunately,  0<y<2  exponents  present  in  most  media  of  practical 
interest.  For  example,  sediments  and  fractal  rock  layers  have  y  around  1,1,4  and  Table  1 

displays values of y for different human tissues, and Fig. 1 (reproduced from Ref. 5) shows 

log-log  plots  of  absorption  versus  frequency  in  some  materials,  where  “shear”  and  “long” 

means shear and longitudinal waves, respectively. YIG is the abbreviation of yttrium indium 

garnet,  and  granites  1  and  2  denote  the  two  types  of  granite,  respectively.  The  unit  decibel 

(dB) is based on powers of 10 (decade) to provide a relative measure of the sound intensity. 

The  slope  of  the  straight  line  is  the  exponent  y  of  frequency  power  law  of  dissipation.  For 

example,  y=1.3  for  1–100  MHz  in  longitudinal  wave  loss  of  bovine  liver.  YIG  as  a  single 

crystalline  material  has  y=2  for  both  longitudinal  and  shear  absorptions  at  very  high 

frequencies.  Clearly,  YIG  is  an  ideal  solid  (atomic  lattice)  rather  than  soft  matter  (fractal 

macromolecules). The longitudinal wave dissipation of granite 1 follows a linear dependence 

(y=1) on frequency from 140 Hz to 2.2 MHz.

I. Anomalous diffusion equation by the fractional Laplacian 

 

Among  various  methodologies  to  tackle  this  mathematical  modeling  challenge,  the  time 

derivative of fractional order has long been considered a most effective means of describing 

the  attenuation  of  non-zero  and  non-quadratic  frequency  dependency.8-10  However,  it  is 

observed from power law formula (1) that exponent y is irrelevant to temporal frequency ω. 

Instead, y is found to vary with media. It is therefore reasonable to think that y may underlie 

spatial  structures  of  media.  In  fact,  the  temporal  representation  of  absorption  effect  works 

under  the  conditions  that  the  thermoviscous  term  is  relatively  small4  and  the  interaction 

between  two  oppositely  traveling  sound  waves  can  be  neglected.8  In  addition,  for  y>1,  the 

time  expression  of  attenuation  needs  the  initial  condition  of  the  second  order  derivative, 

which is not available in most cases. It is also impossible to express the spatial anisotropicity 

of  attenuation  via  scalar  time  operation.  Thus,  a  combination  of  spatial  and  temporal 

representation of absorption is more physically sound.  

Instead  of  the  fractional  time  derivative,  Chen  and  Holm10  applied  the  space  fractional 

Laplacian,  also  known  as  the  Riesz  fractional  derivative,  to  develop  causal  linear  and 

nonlinear  wave  equation  models  being  consistent  with  attenuations  having  arbitrary  power 

law frequency dependency. The dissipative equation for linear isotropic media is expressed as

alternation with respect to frequency) and attenuation behaviors. When y=2, eq. (2) turns out 

to  be  the  thermoviscous  wave  equation  corresponding  to  the  squared-frequency  dependent 

attenuation.  When  y=0,  eq.  (2)  is  reduced  to  the  standard  damped  wave  equation  reflecting 

frequency-dependent  attenuation.  The  hyperbolic wave  equation  (2)  can  be  approximated  to

Namely, the y-stable distribution requires the power y to be positive but not greater than 2.15 

In particular, y=1 corresponds to the Cauchy distribution.13. In terms of this statistical theory, 

the  media  having  y>2  power  law  attenuation  are  not  statistically  stable  in  nature.  In  other 

words,  the  corresponding  probability  density  function  is  no  longer  positively  defined.  It  is 

noted  that  the  Lévy  process  does  not  include  y=0.  This  means  that  the  media  obeying 

absolutely frequency-independent attenuation is simply an ideal approximation. For acoustic 

wave  propagations,  all  media  exhibit  more  or  less  degree  of  absorption  dependence  on 

frequency.  

As shown in power law formula (1), exponent y obtained by experimental data fitting has 

always  been  observed  within  the  finite  scope  in  between  0  and  2  for  all  media.  The  above 

analysis shows that the Lévy stable distribution theory provides a mathematical interpretation 

of empirical [0,2] power dependence of the absorption coefficient y on the frequency.

clearly reveals the self-similar property of frequency power law dissipation. Fractal underlies 

self-similarity,  and  y  can  thus  be  interpreted  as  the  fractal  dimension.  On  the  other  hand, 

 

5

Mandelbrot16  and  Sato17  note  the  inherent  connections  between  the  Lévy  stable  distribution 

and  fractals  due  to  the  inherent  self-similarity  of  the  Lévy  probability  density  functions  as 

illustrated in (7). As discussed previously, y represents the stability index of the Lévy process, 

and thus is the fractal indeed.  

The  invariance  of  y  on  different  frequencies  (time  scales)  implies  that  y  depends 

essentially  on  the  space  mesostructures  or  microstructures  rather  than  time  process.  The 

parameter y actually represents the spatial fractal of media on diffusion process. For example, 

varying  absorption  coefficient  y  over  different  human  body  tissues  means  that  the  fractal  y 

characterizes  the  stochastic  geometric  property  of  macromolecules  of  biomaterials,  which 

dominate their physical behaviors.  

Herrchen18 points out that the self-similarity extends usually only over a finite range in 

real  physical  problems.  This  is  in  agreement  with  many  experiment  observations  that  the 

power law attenuation takes effect over a finite range of finite frequency, as illustrated in Fig. 

1.  

 

 

 

 

IV. Concluding remarks 

Through  the  analysis  of  the  fractional  Laplacian  models  of  the  frequency  power  law 

attenuation, this study found that the exponent y of the frequency power law dissipation can 

be interpreted as the Lévy stability index which are theoretically bounded within (0,2). To our 

knowledge, this work is the first attempt to present a theoretical explanation of [0,2] exponent 

range of the power law attenuation, which has widely been observed not only in acoustics but 

also 

in  many  other  physical  behaviors  such  as  vibrational  damping,  dielectrics, 

thermoviscosity,  and  fluid  thermoviscous  dissipation4.  For  soft  matter  and  non-Newtonian 

fluids, the parameter y is mostly found in between 0 and 2.

We used a variety of nonlinear optical (NLO) spectroscopies to study the singlet excited 

states order, and primary photoexcitations in polyfluorene; an important blue emitting π-

conjugated  polymer.  The  polarized  NLO  spectroscopies  include  ultrafast  pump-probe 

photomodulation in a broad range of 0.2 to 2.6 eV, two-photon absorption in the range of 

3.2  -  4.2  eV,  and  electroabsorption  covering  the  spectral  range  of  2.8  -  5.3  eV.  For 

completeness we also measured the linear absorption and photoluminescence spectra. We 

found that the primary photoexcitations in polyfluorene are singlet excitons with ~ 100 ps 

lifetime  that  have  a  characteristic  photomodulation  spectrum  comprising  of  two 

photoinduced absorption  (PA)  bands, PA1 at 0.55 eV and PA2 at 1.65 eV, respectively, 

and  a  strong  stimulated  emission  band  peaked  at  ~  2.5  eV.  The  two-photon  absorption 

and  electroabsorption  spectra  identify  the  exciton  PA  bands  with  optical  transitions 

between the lowest lying odd symmetry 1Bu exciton at 3.1 eV into two strongly coupled 

even symmetry states, namely mAg at 3.7 eV and kAg at 4.7 eV, respectively. The excited 

states manifold also contains a strongly coupled odd symmetry exciton, nBu at 4.1 eV. A 

polarization  memory  of  ~  2.2  typical  to  π-conjugated  polymer  chains  characterizes  all 

three NLO spectra reflecting the highly anisotropic third-order NLO coefficient χ(3) of the 

polymer  chains.  The  four  essential  excited  states,  namely  the  1Bu,  mAg,  nBu  and  kAg 

were used to satisfactorily fit all three nonlinear optical spectra using the summation over 

states model. The combination of the three NLO spectra and the model fit conclusively 

show that the band model typical to inorganic semiconductors cannot describe the PFO 

polymer. On the contrary, a strongly bound exciton with intrachain binding energy of ~ 

0.9 eV dominates the linear and NLO spectra of this polymer.

1.   Introduction 

Π-conjugated  polymers  have  emerged  as  a  promising  class  of  organic  semiconductors 

due  to  their  low  processing  cost  and  the  broad  range  over  which  their  optical  and 

electronic properties may be chemically tuned [1]. Several device applications have been 

commercialized  such  as  bright  organic  light  emitting  diodes  (OLED)  with  a  variety  of 

colors  ranging  from  red  to  blue,  and  organic  field  effect  transistors;  other  applications 

have  been  investigated  such  as  white  OLED,  large  area  photodetectors,  organic 

photovoltaic  cells,  and  current  injected  lasers  [2,  3].  However  in  spite  of  tremendous 

research of more than a decade, the photophysics of π-conjugated polymers is still hotly 

debated  [4].  For  example,  it  is  still  unclear  whether  the  absorption  spectrum  of  π-

conjugated polymers is due to interband transition (namely valence to conduction band), 

where photon absorption results in free carriers as in inorganic semiconductors [5, 6]; or 

it is excitonic in nature as in molecular solids resulting in singlet excitons as the primary 

photoexcitations  [7].  It  is  generally  accepted  that  photoluminescence  (PL)  is  due  to 

intrachain  excitons  rather  than  interband  transition  of  photogenerated  electrons  (e)  and 

holes  (h).  However  the  formation  of  secondary  interchain  species  in  π-conjugated 

polymer films that are nonradiative charge transfer excitons cannot be ruled out [8]. One 

of the reasons for this confusion is that many π-conjugated polymers show a branching 

ratio  of  photogenerated  excitons  and  charge  polarons  following  photon  absorption  [9, 

10].  This  branching  ratio  has  been  invoked  to  be  due  to  interchain  interaction  between 

adjacent chains [11], which should decrease with larger interchain separation when bulky 

side groups are involved in the polymer structure. 

Polyfluorene  is  an  attractive  material  for  display  applications  due  to  efficient  blue 

emission  [12]  and  relatively  large  hole  mobility  with  trap  free  transport  [13].  Poly(9,9-

dioctylfluorene)  [PFO]  (shown  in  Fig.  1  inset)  exhibits  a  complex  morphological 

behavior that had interesting implications for its photophysical properties [14, 15]. It was 

previously shown that the structural versatility of PFO can be exploited in manipulating 

the  sample  electronic  and  optical  properties  [14,  16].  When  changing  a  pristine  sample 

with glassy structure dubbed the α phase, into a film with more superior order dubbed β 

phase,  then  hole  transport  increases  [16],  laser  action  occurs  at  reduced  excitation

intensities,  and  spectral  narrowing  is  obtained  at  different  wavelengths  [17].  However, 

even  in  the  disordered,    α  phase  PFO  shows  relatively  high  degree  of  planarity,  which 

together  with  the  bulky  side  group  should  provide  a  clean  case  for  studying  intrachain 

photoexcitations  and  characteristic  excited  states  with  only  a  small  contribution  due  to 

interchain  interaction.  Nevertheless  several  early  studies  of  ultrafast  photoexcitation 

dynamics in PFO have led to confusing results. In one study of oriented PFO [18], three 

types  of  photoexcitations  were  invoked  including  hot  carriers,  excitons,  and  charge 

polarons.  In  two  other  studies  [19,  20],  both  excitons  and  bound  polaron  pairs  were 

shown  to  simultaneously  coexist.  Under  these  circumstances  it  is  difficult  to  decide 

whether PFO excited states are band like or excitonic in nature. Some of the reasons for 

this confusion is the relatively narrow spectral range in which the PFO photoexcitations 

were  previously  probed,  the  high  excitation  intensity  used,  as  well  as  the  lack  of  other 

complementary  optical  measurement  techniques  to  fully  understand  the  nature  of  the 

excited  states  in  this  polymer.  In  the  quest  to  understand  the  singlet  manifold  of  PFO 

more  recent  studies  have  focused  on  three  beam  excitation  [21-23],  where  the  role  of 

even  parity  states  was  emphasized.  In  these  studies  it  was  realized  that  when  excited 

deeper  into  the  singlet  manifold  charge  species  are  primarily  photogenerated;  however 

most of them geminately recombine within few ps.   

In  the  present  work  we  employ  a  variety  of  nonlinear  optic  (NLO)  spectroscopies  to 

elucidate  the  photoexcitations  and  important  excited  states  in  the  singlet  manifold  of 

PFO.  The  NLO  spectroscopies  include  ultrafast  pump-probe  photomodulation  (PM), 

electroabsorption  (EA),  and  two-photon  absorption  (TPA);  we  complete  the  optical 

investigation  by  comparing  the  NLO  spectra  with  linear  optical  measurements  that 

include absorption and PL spectra. TPA spectroscopy is sensitive to excited states with 

even,  Ag  symmetry,  and  thus  is  complementary  to  linear  absorption  that  probes  excited 

states  with  odd  or  Bu  symmetry.  EA  spectroscopy  is  sensitive  to  excited  states  of  both 

odd,  Bu  and  Ag  symmetry.  The  TPA  spectrum  was  measured  before  in  another  PFO 

derivative  in  solution  [24];  whereas  the  EA  spectrum  was  measured  in  PFO  film  that 

underwent several phase transitions [14], but the spectra were analyzed in terms of first 

and second derivatives of the absorption spectrum without underlying the role of specific

electronic  excited  states  of  the  polymer.  The  application  of  various  NLO  and  linear 

spectroscopies,  such  as  the  transient  PM,  TPA  and  EA,  together  with  the  linear 

absorption and PL spectra, on the same PFO film has provided a more complete picture 

of the electronic states in PFO compared to previous works.  

The NLO spectra were analyzed in terms of several essential excited states [25] that are 

strongly coupled to each other and to the ground state, namely 1Bu, mAg, nBu, and kAg 

excitonic  states,  using  the  summation  over  states  method  [26];  and  a  consistent  and 

elegant picture for PFO has emerged. We found that the primary photoexcitations in PFO 

are singlet excitons with two photoinduced absorption (PA) bands in the mid- and near-ir 

spectral  ranges,  respectively;  and  a  strong  stimulated  emission  (SE)  band  in  the  visible 

range. The PA bands can be understood [27] as resulting from optical transitions in the 

singlet manifold, namely from 1Bu to mAg and 1Bu to kAg, respectively; and SE from the 

1Bu  to  the  ground  (or  1Ag)  state.    We  conclude  that  PFO  excited  state  manifold  is 

composed of several excitonic states with odd (Bu) and even (Ag) symmetry, rather than a 

continuum band that characterizes regular semiconductors. From our experimental results 

we  infer  that  the  lowest  intrachain  excited  electronic  state  in  PFO  is  a  strongly  bound 

exciton (1Bu), having an intrachain  binding energy of ~ 0.9 eV.  

2. Experimental                 

The transient PM spectrum of the PFO films was studied using the polarized pump-and-

probe correlation technique with ~ 150 fs time resolution. For this study we utilized two 

fs Ti:sapphire laser systems with low and high repetition rates, having high and low pulse 

energies, respectively [7]. These two laser systems separately covered the mid- and near-

ir spectral ranges; the high repetition laser was used in the mid-ir range [20], whereas the 

low  repetition  laser  system  was  used  in  the  near-ir  and  visible  spectral  range  [28].  The 

pump pulses were kept at 3.2 eV for both laser systems. The PM spectra obtained using 

the  two  laser  systems  were  then  normalized  to  each  other  in  the  visible  range    (2  eV) 

providing a very broad probe spectral range from 0.15 to 2.6 eV, with only small spectral 

gaps.

The  low  repetition  rate  high-energy  laser  system  was  a  homemade  Ti:sapphire 

regenerative amplifier that provides pulses of 120 fs duration at photon energies of 1.55 

eV, with 400 μJ energy per pulse at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. The second harmonic of 

the  fundamental  pulses  at  3.2  eV  was  used  as  the  pump  beam.  The  probe  beam  was  a 

white  light  supercontinuum  within  the  spectral  range  from  1.2  to  2.7  eV,  which  was 

generated  using  a  portion  of  the  Ti:sapphire  amplifier  output  in  a  1  mm  thick  sapphire 

plate.  An  overall  time  resolution  of  ∼  150  fs  in  the  pump-probe  measurements  was 

achieved  by  adjusting  the  stage  to  compensate  the  spectral  chirp  as  measured  by  time-

resolved TPA (see below). The probe beam polarization was set to be either parallel or 

perpendicular  to  the  pump  beam  polarization.  To  improve  the  signal-to-noise  ratio,  the 

pump  beam  was  synchronously  modulated  by  a  mechanical  chopper  at  exactly  half  the 

repetition  rate  of  the  Ti:sapphire  laser  system  (~  500  Hz).  The  probe  beam  was 

mechanically  delayed  with  respect  to  the  pump  beam  using  a  computerized  translation 

stage in the time interval, t up to 200 ps. The delay line that corresponds to t = 0 was set 

by  a  sum  frequency  cross  correlation  trace  of  the  pump  and  probe  pulses  in  a  NLO 

crystal.  

 

Since some of the photoexcitation dynamics depend on the excitation density, care was 

taken  in  the  experimental  design  to  minimize  distortion  of  the  measured  pump-probe 

response  by  spatial  inhomogeneity  of  the  photoexcitation  distribution.  The  pump  beam 

was  focused  onto  the  sample  to  a  1  mm  diameter  round  spot,  whereas  the  probe  beam 

was focused using an achromatic lens onto a 0.4 mm diameter spot in the center of the 

pump illuminated spot. To ensure the reproducibility of the alignment, the spatial overlap 

of  the  pump-probe  beams  was  set  using  a  telescopic  microscope.  The  wavelength 

resolution  of  this  system  was  about  4  nm  using  a  1/8-meter  monochromator  with  a  0.6 

mm exit slit, which was placed in the probe beam after it passed through the sample. The 

transient spectrum of the photoinduced change (ΔT) in the sample transmission (T) was 

obtained using a phase-sensitive technique. Following pump photon absorption the probe 

beam  experience  photoinduced  absorption  (PA),  which  is  represented  in  the  spectra  as 

negative differential transmittance, -ΔT/T. Since the pump and probe beams are linearly 

polarized  we  could  measure  ΔTpa  (ΔTpe),  where  the  pump  and  probe  polarization  are 

 

5

parallel (perpendicular) to each other [28]. Pump induced stimulated emission (SE) and 

photobleaching (PB) of the optical absorption in the ground state with ΔT > 0 were also 

measured  [27].  In  the  small  signal  limit,  ΔT(t)  is  expected  to  be  proportional  to  the 

photoexcitation density, N(t) , which for an optically thick film is given by the relation: 

ΔT/T  =  Nσ/αL,  where  σ  is  the  photoexcitation  optical  cross-section,  and  αL  is  the 

absorption  coefficient  at  the  pump  laser  excitation  wavelength.  To  correct  the  pump-

probe  signal  for  intensity  fluctuations  in  the  supercontinuum  at  the  selected  probe 

wavelength,  the  probe  signal  was  normalized  by  a  reference  signal  at  each  delay  time  

(this  technique  was  dubbed  as  “A-B”  [29])  with  a  significant  improvement  in  the 

measured  signal  sensitivity  of  up  to  ΔT/T'=10-4  that  corresponds  to  a  photoexcitation 
density of about 1017 cm-3.  

The  high  repetition  rate  low  energy  laser  system  was  an  optical  parametric  oscillator 

(OPAL  from  Spectra  Physics)  that  was  pumped  by  a  100  fs  Ti:sapphire  laser  oscillator 

(Tsunami,  Spectra  Physics)  at  a  repetition  rate  of  about  80  MHz  [28].  The  pump  beam 

was extracted from the laser oscillator and was frequency doubled to 3.2 eV. The probe 

beam was extracted from the signal and idler beams of the optical parametric oscillator in 

the spectral ranges 0.56–0.68 eV and 0.94–1.02 eV, respectively, with about 150 fs time 

resolution. We extended the spectral range deeper into the ir using difference frequency 

set up in a NLO crystal. When using the signal and idler beams, and changing the central 

frequency of the OPO to 1.55 μm we could extend the spectral range between 0.15 – 1.05 

eV  with  few  local  gaps  in  the  spectrum  [7].  This  laser  system  provides  low-intensity 
measurements,  where  the  pump  intensity  ranges  from  0.1  to  30  mJ/cm2  per  pulse,  with 

ΔT/T resolution ≈10-6 that corresponds to photoexcitation density of 1015 cm-3. 

PFO powder was purchased from ADS (in Canada) and was used to make films either by 

drop cast or spin cast on sapphire substrates, without further purification. For the pump-

probe  studies  all  measurements  were  carried  out  at  room  temperature  in  a  cryostat  that 

provided a dynamical vacuum of 100 μTorr for preventing the polymer film degradation 

due to the strong laser illumination at ambient conditions [30]. Pump-probe signals were 

measured  over  a  range  of  pump  intensities  to  ensure  linearity  of  ΔT/T'  response  with 

 

 

 

6

respect  to  the  initial  photoexcitation  density;  we  thus  work  at  intensities  below  300 

μJ/cm2 per pulse, with typical intensities of about 30 μJ/cm2 to prevent signal saturation.  

The TPA spectrum was measured using the polarized pump-probe correlation technique 

with  the  low  repetition  rate  high-energy  laser  system  at  time  delay  t  =  0.  The  linearly 

polarized  pump  beam  was  set at  1.55 eV, below the  polymer absorption  band;  whereas 

the probe beam from the white light supercontinuum covered the spectral range from 1.6 

to 2.6 eV. The temporal and spatial overlap between the pump and probe beams on the 

sample  film  leads  to  a  photoinduced  absorption  (PA)  signal  that  peaks  at  t  =  0.  We 

interpret it here as due to TPA of one pump photon with one probe photon.  

For  the  EA  measurements  we  used  a  PFO  film  spin  cast  on  a  substrate  with  patterned 

metallic  electrodes  [26].  The  EA  substrate  consisted  of  two  interdigitated  sets  of  a  few 

hundred  gold  electrodes  30  μm  wide  patterned  on  a  sapphire  disk  1  mm  thick.    The 

sample was placed in a cryostat for low temperature measurements. An electric field was 

generated in the sample by applying a potential V to the electrodes.  An applied potential 
V  =  600  Volts  (typical  for  our  experiments)  resulted  in  field  strength  F  =  2x105  V/cm.  

We  varied  V  on  the  electrodes  using  a  sinusoidal  signal  generator  at  f  =  1  kHz,  and  a 

simple  transformer  to  achieve  high  voltages.  For  probing  the  EA  spectrum  we  used  an 

incandescent light source from a Xe lamp, with broadband visible and ultraviolet spectral 

range  from  2.6  to  ~  5.3  eV.  The  light  beam  was  dispersed  through  a  monochromator, 

focused on the sample, and detected by silicon photodiodes. The modulation, ΔT of the 

transmission,  T  is  expected  to  be  the  same  for  positive  and  negative  V’s,  since  the 

polymer  chains  are  not  preferentially  aligned  with  respect  to  the  electrodes.    Thus,  we 

measured ΔT using a lock-in amplifier set to twice the frequency (2f) of the applied field 

[26].  We verified that no EA signal was observed at f or at 3f.  ΔT and T spectra were 

measured  separately  using  a  homemade  spectrometer  that  consisted  of  a  ¼  meter 

monochromator  equipped  with  several  gratings  and  solid-state  detectors  such  as  Si  and 

Si-UV enhanced diodes to span the EA in the broadest spectral range.  The EA spectrum 

was obtained  from the  ratio ΔT/T, which was measured at various applied voltages and 

polarizations of the probe light respect to the direction of the applied field.

2.  Results and discussion 

(i) Absorption and PL spectra 

 

 

 

 

The PFO polymer repeat unit is shown in Fig. 1 inset. The polymer chain is highly planar 

even in the disordered α phase, since the two repeat benzene rings are tied together with 

two  large  adjacent  side  groups.  The  room  temperature  absorption  and  PL  spectra  are 

shown together in Fig. 1 for ease of comparison. The main absorption band peaks at 3.2 

eV with an onset at ~ 2.95 eV; however it is featureless and thus gives the impression of 

a  smooth  absorption  spectrum,  similar  to  that  typical  of  inorganic  semiconductors.  The 

PL spectrum has a relatively small red shift respect to the absorption band, and exhibits a 

clear  vibronic  structure  with  peaks  at  about  2.90  (0-0),  2.72  (0-1),  and  2.55  (0-2)  eV, 

respectively; a fourth phonon side band (0-3) may be seen at ~ 2.37 eV. The vibrational 

series  in  the  PL  spectrum  shows  that  the  polymer  possesses  strong  electron-phonon 

coupling  to  a  strongly  coupled  vibration  (identified  as  the  C=C  stretching),  which, 

however  is  not  clearly  seen  in  the  absorption  spectrum.  The  reason  for  the  apparent 

dissimilarity  between  the  PL  and  absorption  spectra  is  the  existence  of  a  broad 

distribution  of  the  polymer  conjugation  length  (CL),  where  the  characteristic  optical 

energy  gap  of  the  chains  depends  inversely  on  the  CL.  Whereas  the  absorption  process 

occurs to all chains, the PL is preferentially emitted from the longest chains in the film 

having the smallest optical gap; and thus the phonon side bands seen in the PL spectrum 

are  mainly  related  to  these  longer  chains.  We  therefore  conclude  that  the  smooth 

absorption  spectrum  has  little  to  do  with  interband  transition,  but  in  fact  is  an 

inhomogeneous  broadened  version  of  delocalized  π-  π*  transitions  involving  optical 

transitions  from  the  ground  state  (1Ag)  to  the  first  odd-parity  exciton    (1BBu)  [31].  It  is 

interesting to note that the absorption spectrum also contains a small feature at ~ 4.1 eV; 

this feature is enhanced, and thus seen more clearly in the EA spectrum (see below). 

(ii) Electroabsorption spectroscopy 

To elucidate the nature of the excited states responsible for the broad optical absorption 

band in PFO we have applied the EA spectroscopy. EA has provided a sensitive tool for 

8

studying  the  band  structure  of  inorganic  semiconductors  [32],  as  well  as  their  organic 

counterparts  [33-35].  Transitions  at  singularities  of  the  joint  density  of  states  respond 

particularly  sensitively  to  an  external  field,  and  are  therefore  lifted  from  the  broad 

background of the absorption continuum. The EA sensitivity decreases, however in more 

confined  electronic  materials,  where  electric  fields  of  the  order  of  100  kV/cm  are  too 

small of a perturbation to cause sizable changes in the optical spectra. As states become 

more  extended  by  inter-molecular  coupling  they  respond  more  sensitively  to  an 

intermediately  strong  electric  field,  F  since  the  potential  variation  across  such  states 

cannot be ignored compared to the separation of energy levels. EA thus may selectively 

probe extended states and thus is particularly effective for organic semiconductors, which 

traditionally are dominated by excitonic absorption. One of the most notable examples of 

the  application  of  EA  spectroscopy  to  organic  semiconductors  is  polydiacetylene,  in 

which EA spectroscopy was able to separate absorption bands of quasi-1D excitons from 

that of the continuum band [36]. The confined excitons were shown to exhibit a quadratic 
Stark effect, where the EA signal scales with F2 and the EA spectrum is proportional to 

the derivative of the absorption respect to the photon energy. In contrast, the EA of the 
continuum  band  scales  with  F1/3  and  shows  Frank-Keldish  (FK)  type  oscillation  in 

energy. The separation of the EA contribution of excitons and continuum band was then 

used  to  obtain  the  exciton  binding  energy  in  polydiacetylene,  which  was  found  to  be  ~ 

0.5 eV [36].  

Fig. 2 shows the EA spectrum of a PFO film on sapphire substrate up to 5.3 eV, at field 
value F of 105 volt/cm. The EA spectrum was measured at 80 K to decrease the thermal 
effect contribution, which also has a F2 dependence similar to that of the EA itself. There 

are five main spectral features in the EA spectrum: two derivative-like features with zero 

crossing  at  3.1  (assigned  as  1Bu)  and  4.1  eV  (assigned  as  nBu),  respectively;  two  well-

resolved  phonon  sidebands  related  to  the  1Bu  derivative  feature  at  3.2  and  3.4  eV, 

respectively; and two induced absorption bands at 3.7 eV (assigned as mAg) and 4.5 eV 

(assigned as kAg), respectively. No Frank Keldish type oscillation related to the onset of 

the  interband  transition  [36]  is  seen  in  the  EA  spectrum  here.  In  fact,  the  two  main 

derivative-like  features  are  due  to  Stark  shift  characteristic  of  excitons  [34].  We  thus 

 

 

9

conclude that the PFO excited states are better described in terms of excitons, rather than 

in the language of band-to-band transition typical of inorganic semiconductors. We also 

measured  the  polarization  dependence  of  the  EA  spectrum.  We  found  that  the  EA 

spectrum  parallel  to  the  direction  of  the  applied  field  is  about  2.5  larger  than  that 

perpendicular to the field; but otherwise the two spectra are very similar.        

We interpret the EA spectrum as following [26, 35]: The first derivative like features at 

3.1 eV and 4.1 eV are due to a Stark shift of the lowest lying exciton, 1Bu and the most 

strongly coupled exciton, nBu. The second derivative like feature at energies just above 

E(1Bu)  is  due  to  Stark  shift  of  the  1Bu -  related  phonon  side  bands.  These  features  are 

more easily observed in EA than in the linear absorption spectrum because of the strong 

dependence  of  the  exciton  polarizability  on  the  CL  in  the  polymer  chains.  The 
polarizability  was  shown  [37]  to  increase  as  (CL)n,  where  n  ~  6,  and  thus  the  EA 

spectrum  preferentially  focuses  on  long  CL,  similar  to  the  case  of  the  PL  spectrum 

discussed  above.  The  EA  induced  absorption  feature  at  3.7  eV  does  not  have  any 

corresponding spectral feature in the linear absorption spectrum. We therefore conclude 

that  this  feature  in  the  EA  spectrum  involves  a  strongly  coupled  Ag  state,  dubbed  mAg 

[35]. Such a state would not normally show up in the linear absorption spectrum since the 

optical transition from the ground state (1Ag) to mAg is forbidden. The presence of this 

band in the EA spectrum can be explained by the external electric field effect on the film, 

which  breaks  the  symmetry  resulting  in  the  transfer  of  oscillator  strength  from  the 

allowed  1Ag  to  1Bu  transition  to  the  forbidden  1Ag  to  mAg  transition  [25].  The  same 

applies  for  the  EA  feature  at  ~  4.5  eV  assigned  as  kAg  [27];  this  is  another  strongly 

coupled  Ag  state  that  is  further  away  from  the  1Bu,  which,  however  may  be  strongly 

coupled to the nBu in the spectrum [38].  

Electroabsorption is a third-order NLO effect and thus can be described by the third order 

optical susceptibility, namely χ(3)(-ω; ω, 0, 0) [25, 35]:

where d is the film thickness, n is the refractive index, c is the speed of light, and ω is the 

optical frequency; the field modulation f << ω, and this explains the zero frequency for 

χ(3) in Eq. (1). The relation between the EA and χ(3) in Eq. (1) shows that the polarization 

dependence  of  the  EA  spectrum  is  in  fact  related  to  the  anisotropy  of  χ(3)  for  the  PFO 

film.  The  obtained  polarization  of  ~2.5  is  thus  not  surprising  since  the  PFO  polymer 

chains  are  quite  anisotropic,  with  NLO  coefficient  that  is  stronger  along  the  polymer 

chains. We thus expect similar anisotropy to hold also for the other NLO measurements 
described here, which can be also described by χ(3).  

For  obtaining  more  quantitative  information  about  the  main  exciton  states  in  PFO  we 
fitted the EA spectrum using a model calculation. For this fit we calculated χ(3) using the 

summation  over  states  (SOS)  model,  originally  proposed  by  Orr  and  Ward  [39],  and 

further  developed  for  π-conjugated  polymers  by  Mazumdar  at  al.  [25,  35],  and 

implemented in a variety of conducting polymers by Liess et al. [26]. In this model χ(3) is 

a  summation  of  16  terms  each  containing  a  denominator  that  is  proportional  to 

multiplication of several dipole moment transitions, such as from the ground state to 1Bu 

and  1Bu  to  mAg;  and  a  nominator  that  is  resonance  at  energies  related  to  the  main 

essential states [see Eqs. 3-12 in ref. 26]. Apart from the kAg state [38], and according to 

the  “essential  states  picture”  in  π-conjugated  polymers  advanced  by  Mazumdar  and 

colleagues [25, 35], there are four essential states that contribute substantially to the main 

EA  spectral  features  in  these  compounds;  these  are  1Ag,  1Bu,  mAg,  and  nBu.    The 

essential states energies, and dipole moment transitions were taken as free parameters in 

the fit (see Table I). In the fitting we also took into account the main phonon side bands, 

with phonon frequency ~ 185 meV for to the most strongly coupled intrachain vibration 

(the C=C stretching mode); as well as an asymmetric CL distribution function [26]. The 

phonon side bands and the CL distribution were shown to be very important in fitting the 

EA spectra of many π-conjugated polymers [26]. The solid line in Fig. 2 shows the best 

fit to the EA spectrum as obtained using the parameters given in Table I; the agreement 

between the model calculation and experimental spectra is very good. From Table I we 

11

get the energies of the most strongly coupled excitons in PFO as following: E(1Bu) = 3.1 

eV;  E(mAg)  =  3.7  eV;    and  E(nBu)  =  4.0  eV.  Furthermore  from  the  EA  spectrum  at 

energies above E(nBu) we approximate E(kAg) = 4.7 eV [38]. These essential states play 

an important role in the other two NLO spectroscopies, namely the TPA and transient PM 

spectra as discussed below.  

From the magnitude of the EA signal compared to the first derivative of the absorption 

spectrum, an estimate of the difference in polarizability, Δp between the ground and the 

first excited state, namely the 1Bu may be obtained [14, 26]. This requires a careful fit to 

the absorption spectrum using the same parameters that were used to fit the EA spectrum 

and  a  different  CL  distribution  function  [26].  Instead  we  estimate  Δp  from  a  simple 

comparison  of  the  PFO  EA  spectrum  to that of a various polymers where  Δp is known 

[26].  We obtained a polarizability difference between 1Ag and 1Bu states, Δp ~ 5000 Å3 

in fair agreement with a previous estimate [14].   

It  is  known  that  the  continuum  band  in  π-conjugated  polymers  is  very  close  to  E(nBu) 

[35]; it is thus tempting to identify the transition from the ground state into the continuum 

band from the linear absorption spectrum. Based on the EA spectrum at ~ 4 eV and its 

analysis in term of E(nBu), we then tentatively assign the absorption band II in the linear 

absorption spectrum (Fig. 1) at ~ 4.1 eV as the optical transition from the 1Ag to nBu (or 

continuum) state. We estimate the absorption strengths ratio of bands I and II in the linear 

absorption spectrum (Fig. 1) to be ~ 100:1. It is well established that in semiconductors 

the interband transition strength substantially decreases relative to the exciton transition 

strength for large exciton binding energy, Eb [35, 36]. The large ratio obtained between 

bands I and II in the absorption spectrum thus indicates that Eb in PFO is relatively large, 

of the order of 0.5 eV. Actually we may estimate Eb of the lowest lying singlet exciton in 

PFO from the relation E(nBu) – E(1Bu). From the values given in Table I we get a large 

binding  energy,  Eb  ≈  0.9  eV.  This  large  Eb  is  not  unique  in  the  class  of  π-conjugated 

polymers.  It  is  similar  to  Eb  extracted  for  MEH-PPV  (Eb  ≈  0.8  eV)  when  using  the 

corresponding  EA  spectrum  [26].  The  large  value  for  Eb  shows  that  electron-hole 

 

 

 

12

interaction, and electron correlation [15] are relatively large in PFO, and do not permit to 

describe this polymer in terms used by the semiconductor band model [4]. 

(iii) Two-photon-absorption spectroscopy 

In π-conjugated polymers the optical transitions between the ground state 1Ag and the Bu 

excitonic states are allowed; in particular the transition between 1Ag to 1Bu dominates the 

absorption  spectrum  [40,  41].  On  the  contrary,  the  optical  transitions  between  1Ag  to 

other  states  with  Ag  symmetry  are  forbidden;  however,  these  optical  transitions  are 

allowed  in  two-photon-absorption  (TPA)  [25].  Therefore  TPA  spectroscopy  has  been 

used  in  the  class  of  π-conjugated  polymers  to  get  information  about  the  Ag  energies  in 

these materials [42, 43]. This information is important since transitions of photogenerated 

1Bu  excitons  to  Ag  states  are  dipole  allowed,  and  thus  dominate  the  PA  spectrum  of 

excitons  in  π-conjugated  polymers  [44].  In  addition,  it  was  also  found  [45]  that  the 

resonant  Raman  scattering  dispersion  known  to  exist  in  π-conjugated  polymers, 

surprisingly  depend  on  the  lowest  lying  Ag  states,  rather  than  the  Bu  states;  and  thus 

E(Ag) are worthy to determine in this class of materials. 

Usually the TPA spectrum has been measured in π-conjugated polymers either directly by 

techniques such as optical absorption at high excitation intensity [46, 47], and Z-scan [48, 

49];  or  indirectly  by  measuring  the  fluorescence  emission  following  TPA  at  high 

intensity;  a  technique  dubbed  two-photon-fluorescence  [50].  Typically  two  TPA  bands 

are observed in π-conjugated polymers, namely mAg and kAg, where E(mAg) < E(kAg) 

[42]. It is noteworthy mentioning that in nonluminescent π-conjugated polymers, such as 

t-(CH)x [46] and polydiacetylene [47], it was measured that E(2Ag) < E(1Bu). In this case 

the  photogenerated  1Bu  excitons  quickly  undergo  internal  conversion  into  the  lowest 

energy exciton that is the 2Ag; consequently the transient PL emission is very fast, of the 

order of 200 fs. However it has been found [42] that the 2Ag state is not easy to detect by 

NLO techniques since it is not strongly coupled to any Bu states, and thus is very weak in 

both TPA and EA spectra.

In the present work we have chosen to measure the TPA spectrum using the pump and 

probe technique at t = 0. The linearly polarized pump beam from the low repetition high 

power laser system was set at 1.55 eV, below the polymer absorption band; whereas the 

probe  beam  from  the  white  light  supercontinuum  with  polarization  either  parallel  or 

perpendicular  to  that  of  the  pump  beam  spreads  the  spectral  range  from  1.6  to  2.6  eV, 

thus covering the TPA photon energy from 3.15 to 4.15 eV. If only linear absorption is 

considered, then the pump beam alone is unable to generate photoexcitations above the 

gap,  since  its  photon  energy  is  much  smaller  than  the  optical  gap  of  PFO  at  ~  3.1  eV. 

However the temporal and spatial overlap between the pump and probe beams leads to a 

photoinduced absorption (PA) signal that peaks at t = 0. As seen in Fig. 3 this PA has a 

temporal profile similar to the cross-correlation function of the pump and probe pulses, 

which we interpret here as due to TPA of one pump photon with one probe photon. The 

long temporal tail seen in Fig. 3 at times longer than that of the cross correlation function 

is caused by PA of photoexcitations that are generated due to the TPA of the pump pulses  

alone  [22].  This  tail  was  subtracted  out  from  the  transient  response  at  t  =  0  to  give  the 

TPA spectrum clear from the PA due to the TPA-related photoexcitations. Otherwise the 

TPA related to the pump pulses does not directly influence the transmission of the probe 

pulses. Two separate TPA spectra were obtained; where the probe beam polarization set 

either parallel, or perpendicular to the pump beam polarization. 

 
Figure 4(a) shows the TPA spectrum in PFO film up to 4.4 eV compared with the linear 

absorption  spectrum.  The  TPA  shows  a  relatively  broad  band  peaked  at  3.7  eV,  which 

has comparable width to that of the linear absorption band. We interpret the TPA band at 

3.7 eV as the inhomogeneously broadened mAg state in PFO [24, 44], in agreement with 

the EA spectra discussed above (see Table I). We emphasize that the TPA spectrum has 

zero strength at 3.2 eV, at the photon energy where the linear absorption spectrum has a 

maximum.  In  the  semiconductor  band  model  the  VB  and  CB  continuum  bands  are 

composed of states of both odd and even symmetries that form a band. In this case the 

TPA and linear absorption spectra overlap, or have very little difference, perhaps because 

slightly different optical dipole moments [38, 42]. In contrast, it is apparent that the TPA 

and  linear  absorption  spectra  do  not  overlap  in  PFO;  in  fact  there  is  ~  0.5  eV  energy 

 

14

difference between their respective maxima (Fig. 4(a)). This is compelling evidence that 

the  semiconductor  band  model  cannot  properly describe the PFO excited states. On the 

contrary, the energy difference between the linear and TPA spectra of ~ 0.5 eV sets the 

lower limit for the exciton binding energy in this polymer, in agreement with Eb extracted 

above from the EA spectrum.  

Figure  4(b)  shows  the  polarization  anisotropy  in  the  TPA  spectrum.  The  parallel  and 

perpendicular TPA spectra differ by a factor of ~ 2.2; but otherwise they show the same 

spectral features. The polarization anisotropy found in TPA is in agreement with that of 

the EA spectrum. This is not surprising since both NLO spectra are related to the same 
χ(3)  thus  reflecting  its  anisotropy,  which  is  caused  by  the  quasi  1D  properties  of  the 

polymer  chains.  The  two  TPA  spectra  were  fitted  using  the  SOS  model,  where  TPA  ~  

Imχ(3)(ω ; ω, -ω, ω), with the same parameters as for the fit to the EA spectrum; no extra 

parameter  is  needed.  The  agreement  between  the  obtained  spectrum  and  the  model 

calculation is excellent. This validates the SOS model and its parameters.  

(iii) Transient photomodulation spectroscopy        

We measured the polarized pump and probe spectroscopy in a broad spectral range from 

0.2 to 2.6 eV; this has never been possible before. For this extraordinary broad spectral 

range  we  used  two  different  laser  systems  with  PM  probe  spectrum  in  the  mid  ir  (high 

repletion  rate  laser)  and  near  ir/visible  range  (low  repetition  laser)  [7].  The  two  spectra 

were  normalized  to  each  other  in  the  visible  range,  where  the  PM  was  measured  using 

both  laser  systems,  either  the  white  light  continuum  of  the  low  repetition  rate  laser  or 

with a doubled mid ir probe. Figure 5(a) shows the full PM spectrum of a PFO film at 

two delay times, t = 0 and t = 20 ps. The PM spectrum contains two relatively sharp PA 

bands (PA1 and PA2 in Fig. 5) at 0.55 and 1.65 eV, respectively, and a SE band that peaks 

at 2.5 eV. The three bands decay dynamics are shown in Fig. 5(b); the decay dynamics of 

all  three  bands  are  equal,  with  a  lifetime  of  ~  100  ps.  This  shows  that  the  PM  bands 

belong  to  the  same  photogenerated  species,  in  contrast  to  earlier  measurements  [18]. 

Since  stimulated  emission  of  excitons  is  obtained,  we  then  attribute  this  species  to 

photogenerated singlet exciton, namely the 1Bu exciton. We therefore conclude that the 

 

 

 

15

two PA bands related to the photogenerated excitons in PFO are transitions from 1Bu to 

the two most strongly coupled Ag excitons in the singlet manifold, namely mAg and kAg, 

respectively; no hot excitons [18] or polarons [19] are needed to interpret this spectrum. 

Thus the three NLO spectroscopies, namely EA, TPA and transient PM are in agreement 

with each other, and show that few essential states are sufficient to understand the NLO 

spectra in PFO.  

In contrast to PPV derivatives [5, 6, 9], the PM spectrum of PFO does not show any other 

band that may be related to photogeneration of charge polarons. This is in agreement with 

the  large  exciton  intrachain  binding  energy  that  we  found  in  PFO.  Also  it  clearly 

indicates  that  the  bulky  side  groups  of  PFO  do  not  allow  for  large  contribution  of  the 

interchain  interaction,  which  is  largely  responsible  for  polaron  photogeneration  in  π-

conjugated  polymer  films  [11].  Our  results  are  in  agreement  with  lack  of  long-lived 

polaron photogeneration in as spun (i.e. glassy, α phase) PFO film measured by the cw 

PM technique [14]. Another possibility for the lack of polaron photogeneration here is the 

proximity of the laser excitation photon energy (~ 3.2 eV) to the absorption onset of PFO 

(~ 3.0 eV) [23]. From the excitation dependence of charge photogeneration in PFO using 

cw  PM  spectroscopy  it  was  found  [14]  that  the  quantum  efficiency  of  polaron 

photogeneration dramatically increases at photon energies close to E(mAg) ~ 3.7 eV; up 

to this photon energy there is basically very little steady state photogenerated polarons. 

We thus expect dramatic changes to occur in the transient PM spectrum of PFO at higher 

excitation  photon  energies  [23],  and/or  when  the  glassy  phase  changes  into  a  more 

ordered phase [20], and/or when a strong electric field such as in organic light emitting 

diodes  made  of  PFO  is  capable  of  exciton  dissociation  even  at  low  excitation  photon 

energy [51].  

3.  Summary 

We  used  a  variety  of  linear  and  nonlinear  optical  spectroscopies  to  study  the  excited 

states  and  photoexcitations  of  the  important  polymer  PFO  with  blue  PL  emission.  The 

NLO  spectroscopies  include  electroabsorption,  two-photon  absorption,  and  ultrafast 

photomodulation;  whereas  the  linear  spectroscopies  were  PL  emission  and  absorption. 

16

 

 

 

We  found  that  the  excited  states  of  PFO  are  dominated  by  four  essential  states  that 

determine the NLO spectra. These are both odd and even parity excitons: 1Bu, mAg, nBu 

and  kAg.  Their  energies  and  optical  dipole  moments  were  determined  by  a  summation 

over states model that was used to fit the three obtained NLO spectra, and summarized in 

Fig. 6. All four states contribute to the EA spectrum; only the Ag states are seen in the 

TPA spectrum, and the transitions from 1Bu to mAg and kAg, respectively show up in the 

PM spectrum of the photogenerated excitons. 

PFO cannot be described by the semiconductor band model. The best evidence for this is 

the comparison between the TPA and linear absorption spectra. The two spectra peak at 

energies that are ~ 0.5 eV apart; moreover the TPA gets a zero at the peak location of the 

linear  absorption.  This  is  impossible  to  explain  by  the  band  model.  Another  strong 

indication  that  PFO  is  excitonic  in  nature  is  the  characteristic  properties  of  the  primary 

photoexcitations.  These  are  excitons  with  two  strong  PA  bands  in  the  mid-  and  near-ir 

spectral  range,  and  a  SE  band  in  the  visible  spectral  range,  rather  than  a  typical  free 

carrier absorption that characterizes photogenerated carriers in usual 3D semiconductors, 

such as Si and GaAs. Also the EA spectrum does not contain any FK oscillation at the 

continuum band edge, but instead shows Stark shift of the main excitons, and transfer of 

oscillator strength to the most strongly coupled Ag states.     

From  the  difference  between  E(nBu)  and  E(1Bu)  in  the  excited  state  spectrum,  we 

estimate  the  lowest  exciton  binding  energy  Eb  ~  0.9  eV.  This  is a  large  binding  energy 

that  indicates  a  strongly  bound  exciton.  Such  an  excitons  ‘steals’  most  of  the  oscillator 

strength from the interband transition. Indeed there is a huge factor of ~ 100 between the 

excitonic transition 1Ag to 1Bu compared to the interband transition that we identify here 

as  the  1Ag  to  nBu  transition.  We  also  obtained  the  polarizability  of  the  lowest  lying 
exciton; this is 5000 Å3 that gives an exciton wave function extent of few repeat units. 

The seemingly contradiction between the obtained exciton wave function extent and the 

large binding energy may be explained by the 1D character of the excitons in PFO.

Table I 

The best fitting parameters for the EA spectrum of PFO using the SOS model with four 

essential states, namely 1Ag, 1Bu, mAg, and nBu; as well as a CL distribution and phonon 

coupling [24]. The parameters are described in detail in ref. 24, and include the essential 

states’ energies, E(1Bu), E(mAg), and E(nBu); as well as their relative displacements, Δq 

respect to each other. hν phonon is the main vibration side band; and the CL distribution 

is characterized by the width γ, and asymmetry η.     

E(1Bu)(eV) 
Δq1 = q(1Bu)-q(1Ag) 
E(mAg) (eV) 
Δq2 = q(mAg)-q(1Bu) 
E(nBu)(eV) 
Δq3=q(nBu)-q(mAg) 
hν phonon (meV) 
CL distribution width γ (eV) 
CL distribution asymmetry η

Fig.  1:  (Color  on  line)  The  normalized  absorption  and  photoluminescence  emission 

spectra  of  a  PFO  film  in  the  glassy  α  phase.  The  polymer  repeat  unit  is  shown  in  the 

Figure Captions  

inset.  

Fig.  2:  (Color  on  line)  The  measured  electroabsorption  spectrum  (crosses)  of  PFO,  and 

the model fit (line) through the data points using the SOS model with fitting parameters 

given in Table I. The essential states 1Bu, mAg, nBu and kAg are assigned. 

Fig. 3: (Color on line) The transient TPA trace (blue line) of the pump and probe pulses 

measured on a PFO film, compared to the pump-probe cross correlation trace measured 

using a NLO crystal. The relatively long-lived PA plateau is due to the PA related to the 

photoexcitations generated by TPA from the pump pulses.     

Fig. 4: (Color on line) (a) The two-photon absorption (TPA) spectrum of PFO (circles) 

compared to the linear absorption spectrum (line). The essential states 1BBu and mAg are 

assigned. (b) The TPA spectrum measured with pump probe polarization either parallel 

(crosses) or perpendicular (circles) to each other. The line through the data points is a fit 

using the SOS model with parameters given in Table I.     

Fig. 5: (Color on line) (a) The transient PM spectra of PFO at t = 0 (red circles), and t = 

20 ps (blue circles). The PA bands PA1, PA2 and SE are assigned. (b) The transient decay 

dynamics of the main bands assigned in (a). 

Fig.  6:  (Color  on  line)  The  essential  states  energies  and  allowed  optical  transitions  in 

PFO.  The  PA  bands  are  excited  state  absorptions;  α  and  TPA  are  linear  and  NLO 

absorption; and PL may be also replaced by SE in the pump-probe experiment.

Abstract.

§

We have recently introduced the idea of making use of three-photon positron
annihilations in positron emission tomography. In this paper the basic characteristics
of the three-gamma imaging in PET are studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations
and analytical computations. Two typical conﬁgurations of human and small animal
scanners are considered. Three-photon imaging requires high energy resolution
detectors. Parameters currently attainable by CdZnTe semiconductor detectors, the
technology of choice for the future development of radiation imaging, are assumed.
Spatial resolution is calculated as a function of detector energy resolution and size,
position in the ﬁeld of view, scanner size, and the energies of the three gamma
annihilation photons. Possible ways to improve the spatial resolution obtained for
nominal parameters: 1.5 cm and 3.2 mm FWHM for human and small animal scanners,
respectively, are indicated. Counting rates of true and random three-photon events for
typical human and small animal scanning conﬁgurations are assessed. A simple formula
for minimum size of lesions detectable in the three-gamma based images is derived.
Depending on the contrast and total number of registered counts, lesions of a few mm
size for human and sub mm for small animal scanners can be detected.

1. Introduction

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is the method of choice in functional medical
imaging, both in clinical practice and research involving small animals. It uses short-
lived positron emitting radionuclides to mark biologically active substances which can be
traced while being metabolised in the body by detecting co-linear annihilation photon
pairs and reconstructing the image.

Medical imaging is not the only application of positrons. Apart from basic nuclear
and elementary particle research, the physics of positron annihilation investigates the
interactions of positrons with matter (Charlton and Humberston 2001). They are a
sensitive probe allowing to acquire information about subtle structural and chemical
properties of materials by precise measurements of annihilation radiation. Three
main experimental methods are employed: positron lifetime spectroscopy, angular
correlation of annihilation radiation and Doppler broadening of annihilation radiation.
Combinations of the above are also in use. None of these concepts is currently used
in PET, apart from accounting for the non-colinearity of the annihilation photons and
ﬁnite positron range contributing to deterioration of spatial resolution. Annihilation
pairs are used merely to determine the activity distribution changing in time.

We introduced recently the idea of three-photon PET imaging (Kacperski et al
2004, Kacperski and Spyrou 2004a). It was shown that the relatively rare (about 0.5 %
in water) 3-photon positron annihilations (Ore and Powell 1949, De Benedetti and Siegel
1954) can also be used for imaging. By detecting the positions and energies of the three
photons, one can easily locate the point where the annihilation occurred. Thus the
amount of information obtained from a single event is higher than for a 2γ pair, where
localisation is along a line. The rate of 3γ decay is not only proportional to concentration
of activity but is also sensitive to the local physical and chemical environments, notably
the presence of oxygen (Cooper et al 1967, Klobuchar and Karol 1980, Hopkins and
Zerda 1990, Kakimoto et al 1990). This is due to formation of positronium: a positron
- electron bound state, which behaves as an active chemical particle. 75 % of the
positronium is formed as an ortho-positronium, triplet state which in vacuum annihilates
only into 3γ with a relatively long lifetime of 142 ns. In matter interaction processes, in
general called quenching, that lead to 2γ annihilations are usually much faster, reducing
the fraction of three-photon annihilations.

Measuring and imaging oxygenation of tissues is important in various clinical
in oncology (tumour hypoxia, radiosensitivity), cardio-
contexts (Machulla 1999), e.g.
and cerebrovascular disease and infections by anaerobic microorganisms.
Intensive
research is ongoing to develop radiotracers for imaging hypoxia. When the 3γ
annihilations, which are simply ignored in the current PET scanners, are recorded,
the positron itself, or more precisely the positronium, could serve as an oxygen-sensitive
tracer. Oxygen is known to be a strong positronium quencher, therefore hypoxic regions
should be characterised by higher 3γ rates than those well oxygenated. The oxygenation
image would be obtained alongside e.g. a routine FDG PET, saving cost, patient

radiation dose and inconvenience incurred by extra speciﬁc scan.

In this paper we explore further the idea of 3γ imaging by assessing the dependence
of spatial resolution on various system parameters like the size of the detectors, their
energy resolution, size of the scanner, position within the ﬁeld of view as well as the
particular combination of three photon energies. We focus on two scanner conﬁgurations
commonly used in practice: a small animal and a full body human scanner. The expected
3γ counting rates are estimated and examples of images obtained from 3γ annihilations
are produced. A formula for the minimum size of detectable lesions with respect to
contrast and number of counts recorded is derived.

2. Theory

Let us recall the basic principles of 3γ PET imaging (Kacperski et al 2004). Consider
a 3γ-decay event that occurs at a point r = (x, y, z) (see ﬁgure 1).

In addition, the law of energy conservation has also to be satisﬁed:

E1 + E2 + E3 = mec2

1022keV.

≈

The energies have a continuous spectrum from 0 to 511 keV with the probability
distribution approximately uniform in the E1E2 space (Ore and Powell 1949, Chang and
Tang 1985). With known detector positions r1, r2, and r3, the measurement of photon
energies E1, E2, and E3, enables the solution of the nonlinear set of equations (1) to
determine the point r at which annihilation took place. Since the energy resolution
and size of the detectors are ﬁnite, the location of annihilation is broadened into a
region surrounding the point r. Note, however, that in contrast to the 2γ decay, we
obtain (neglecting the ﬁnite measurement accuracy) full information on the position of
annihilation from a single event, rather than just a line of response. Unlike the rather
intricate image reconstruction methods required for 2γ events, one only needs to solve
the nonlinear equations (1) to retrieve r from a 3γ event. The image is thus formed as a
set of dots, each corresponding to a single 3γ positron decay. It can be processed further
by performing appropriate attenuation correction and e.g. window averaging to obtain
the usual grayscale or colour-coded pixels display. Let us stress that the recording of
three-photon events is done simultaneously with the prevailing 511 keV photon pairs.
3γ imaging is by no means an alternative to conventional PET, but rather an add-on,
making use of the annihilation radiation which is currently wasted, it provides extra
information. Dividing the 3γ image by the 2γ one we obtain a map of 3γ/2γ decay
probability ratio. This is actually a new imaging modality.

3. CdZnTe detectors for PET

It is clear from the equation (1) that uncertainty in the energies E1, E2, and E3
will result in a spread of the reconstructed annihilation site r. As it is indicated in
(Kacperski et al 2004) and section 4.1.1 of this paper, the energy resolution is actually
the crucial factor determining the spatial resolution of 3γ imaging. With currently
dominating PET scanners which are based on scintillator detectors (energy resolution
typically worse than 15%) it is not possible to obtain an accteptable 3γ image. However,
new detector materials are gradually making their way into PET imaging technology,
notably the room temperature operating semiconductors CdZnTe (Moses et al 1994,
Scheiber and Gaikos 2001, Verger et al 2004). The main reason for considering the
new material is the improvement in intrinsic spatial resolution due to precise depth-
of-interaction information, which results in better image resolution and is of primary
importance, specially in small animal imaging (Stickel and Cherry 2005). Compact
scanner design and much better energy resolution allowing eﬃcient rejection of scattered
events are further advantages. The latter factor also allows implementation of the
3-photon modality. CdZnTe cameras are already becoming increasingly popular in
SPECT. The price of the material, processing electronics and implementation of a new
technology are still inhibiting factors, nevertheless, projects to built prototype small

animal CdZnTe PET scanners are already under way. Many of the material related
problems, like slow charge collection, can be greatly reduced by the use of stacked thin
position sensitive detector arrays (Nemirovsky et al 2001, Moss et al 2001, Redus et
al 2004) with appropriate pulse processing electronics. Currently energy resolutions of
1% at 662 keV can be achieved. Best timing resolutions range between 5 and 8 ns, and
recently even 2.8 ns has been reported (Drezet et al 2004).

4. Monte Carlo simulations: small animal and human scanner models

Performance of PET imaging based on 3-photon annihilations has been investigated for
two kinds of model scanners: small animal and whole body human. We assumed the
usual cylindrical scanner geometry with square faced detector elements (no dead layers).
The parameters of the scanners are given in Table 1.

In order to investigate their inﬂuence on the spatial resolution chosen parameters
have been modiﬁed during the simulations, with all others remaining ﬁxed as in table 1.

4.1. Spatial resolution

For each particular set of parameters at least 105 detected three-photon events emitted
from a point source placed in the centre of the scanner were simulated. This was
assumed to obtain the point spreads with high statistical accuracy, and does not reﬂect
the actually achievable counting rates of 3γ photons; this issue is addressed separately
in section 4.2. Finite size and energy resolution of detectors were the only sources of
blurring in the reconstructed image. We neglected the range of positrons in matter and
residual momentum of the electron-positron pair. These factors are brieﬂy discussed
in section 5. Any photon hitting the surface of a detector element in the scanner was
assumed to be detected at the centre of that element. The maximum photon position
error is therefore √2/2 times the detector size. We assumed that the energy resolution
of the detectors depends on photon energy according to δE = A√E, where the constant
A was chosen so that the relative energy resolution at 662 keV is 1% (except section

4.1.1). After the reconstruction procedure, as described in section 2, standard deviation
and FWHM of the reconstructed point were calculated.

4.1.1. Energy resolution of detectors Let us begin with the dependence of a point
source blur on the energy resolution of the detectors which is shown in ﬁgure 2. Clearly,

good energy resolution of detectors is crucial for 3-photon imaging. With the scintillators
currently used for which the energy resolution is usually worse than 15% at 662 keV
one cannot obtain an acceptable image from the 3γ events. However, with CdZnTe
detectors of energy resolution 1%, or better, at 662 keV, the spatial resolutions that
can be obtained become acceptable, although worse than typical values for conventional
PET. At very high energy resolutions the inﬂuence of detector size can be noticed
(saturation at a non-zero value for δE = 0), whereas above 1%, energy resolution is the
dominating source of blurring.

4.1.2. Position in the FOV In the following simulations the variation of the spatial
resolution within the ﬁeld of view has been investigated as the point source was moved
along the radial and axial directions. The results for the radial direction are shown in
ﬁgure 3.

The point spread is a combination of errors in photon energy and position detection.
In order to see the inﬂuence of both factors we ran separate series of simulations assuming
perfect energy detection (error in photon position only), point-like detectors (error in

in ﬁgure 3, the energy error contribution increases, while the photon position error
decreases with the transaxial distance from the central axis. In eﬀect, the resolution is
quite uniform across the FOV, deteriorating sharply only close to the scanner walls. For
the human scanner the optimal resolution is actually achieved at about 25 cm oﬀ-centre.

It should also be noted that the shape of the point spread function is spatially
nonuniform. For the point at the centre the spread in the transaxial direction equals
1.06 cm and 0.2 cm FWHM, respectively, for human and small animal scanner, whilst
in the z direction it is 0.26 cm and 0.136 cm, respectively. As we move oﬀ from the
central axis the PSF becomes elongated in the radial direction.

4.1.3. Size of detectors Keeping the geometric proportions of the scanners ﬁxed as in
table 1 the size of (square) detectors was changed, and their number adjusted accordingly
to keep the sizes of scanners constant. Figure 5 shows the results of the simulations
with detector energy resolution 1% at 662 keV (solid lines) and perfect energy detection
(dashed lines).

The overall dependence, similar to ﬁgure 2, is close to linear. Comparison of both
curves for each scanner reveals the contributions of the two sources of error and indicates
the direction of potential improvements. For our model human scanner with detector size
4 mm the reconstructed point spread results mainly from the energy detection error (cf.
also ﬁgure ??), therefore decreasing the size of detectors, without improving their energy
resolution, would hardly improve the spatial resolution. For the small animal scanner
with 2 mm detector elements the contribution from photon position detection error is
higher, so reducing eﬀective detector size would bring some performance improvement,
although energy resolution is still more critical. The inﬂuence of detector size becomes
more important for points far from the centres of scanners (see ﬁgure ??).

The dashed lines show the same dependance assuming perfect energy resolution (no

4.1.4. Size of scanner The inﬂuence of the scanner size on the spatial resolution was
studied by changing the diameter D of the scanners and their axial length (number of
rings) to preserve the geometric proportions as in table 1. The size of detectors was kept
constant and their number adjusted to cover the whole cylinder. Again, three separate
simulations were run for each scanner: assuming perfect detection of photon energy, or
position, and modelling errors in both. The results can be seen in ﬁgure 6.

One can clearly see that the near-linear dependence is due to the energy resolution
error which depends linearly on scanner size. The detector size component remains
constant. For both human and small animal scanners reducing scanner size as much as
possible is desirable from the point of view of 3γ imaging. This dependence is the main
reason why the spatial resolution of the small animal scanner is signiﬁcantly better than
that of human the scanner.

4.1.5. Energies of photons and cut-oﬀ energies As it was mentioned in section 2, the
three photons can have any combination of energies satisfying (2) and (1). The error of
the annihilation site r recovered from (1) is a rather complex function of E1, E2 and E3.
We have calculated the FWHM spreads of a point source at the centre of the human
scanner emitting photons with a particular energy combination satisfying (2) and (1)
(ﬁgure 7). The spreads were averaged over the remaining free parameters (directions of
emission).

The resolution is optimal for the symmetric three-photon decay with all energies

never detect energies from the entire 3γ spectrum 0-511 keV. At the upper end the
511 keV photopeak resulting from the dominating 2γ decays has to be cut-oﬀ. On the
other hand, there is a detector and noise related low energy detection limit. Figure 7

There is, however, the common sensitivity-resolution trade-oﬀ: as the window narrows,
the number of counts detected drops, so a compromise choice has to be made.

Figure 7 also suggests a relatively easy way of improving spatial resolution without
losing counts. In all our simulations we treat all the reconstructed 3γ annihilation points
equally. We could, however, using the relation shown in ﬁgure 7, assign a weight to each
point according to the particular energy combination, so that counts with energies close
to optimal (E1 = E2 = E3 = 340.7 keV) would contribute more than those with energies
close to extreme. Such approach would probably improve spatial resolution by about
30 - 40 %.

4.2. Counting rates and random scattered 3γ events

Poissonian noise is one of the key limiting factors in nuclear medicine imaging. With the
probability of three-photon annihilations being two to three orders of magnitude lower
than that of two-photon, the question of suﬃcient number of counts obviously needs to
be addressed. Will it be enough to obtain meaningful images?

We will assess the rates of 3γ counts for our two model scanners with phantoms in
the form of spheres ﬁlled with water and uniform positron activity distribution. The
diameters of the spheres are 20 cm and 4 cm for the human and small animal scanners,
respectively; they are placed at the centres of the scanners. The counting rate C3γ
of true 3γ decays is in general determined by probabilities of emission, detection and
attenuation. It can be expressed by the formula

C3γ = A r3γ/2γ Ecut η def f g3γ (e−Aτ + q1Aτ e−Aτ + q2(Aτ )2e−Aτ ),

(3)

where A is the total activity in the phantom. The meaning of the factors and their
values for the two model systems is summarized in table 2. The expression in brackets
approximates the probability that a true three-photon decay will not be obscured by
(one or more) coincident 2γ events. The three terms correspond to zero, one and
two 2γ pairs respectively. Higher order coincidences are negligible at the activities
relevant for PET. The factors q1 and q2 are the probabilities of unique identiﬁcation
of the true 3γ event despite the coincident 2γ photons. This is possible because the
coincident photons may just miss the scanner, or, if they are detected, their energies
are quite diﬀerent from those of 3γ annihilation. Numerical values of the parameters
were obtained from simulations and analytical calculations. We assumed the scanners
to be made of 3 cm thick CdZnTe detectors, which yields average full energy photopeak
eﬃciency for the 3γ photons of about 85%. The 3γ/2γ ratio was derived from positron
lifetime experimental data for water and organic liquids. In fact, it depends sensitively
on the chemical composition of the solution. Usually dissolved ions as well as gases (in
particular oxygen) lead to a decrease of 3γ rate. On the other hand, the ratio increases
in liquids of smaller surface tension. The r3γ/2γ ratio for pure, degassed water is about
0.5%; in alcohols it reaches about 0.7%. The minimum value occurring in substances
(e.g. metals) where no positronium is formed is 0.27%. Our choice of r3γ/2γ = 0.4%
seems therefore reasonable and not too optimistic.

The 3γ counting rates for both scanners are plotted in ﬁgures 9 and 10. They
can amount up to about 1000 cps for human scanner and 80,000 cps for small animal
scanner. The diﬀerence is mainly due to the larger solid angle covered and much smaller
attenuation for the small object.

In conventional 2γ PET, apart from the true coincidence counts forming the image,
there are scattered and randomly coincident photons contributing to image noise. In
the case of 3γ imaging those two kinds of events have to be considered simultaneously.
Because of the resolution requirement we need to use high energy resolution detectors
(see section 4.1.1). The unique properties of 3γ decay, in particular the energy condition
(2) enables then to eﬃciently distinguish the true events from accidental coincidences.
Nevertheless, it can happen that all the conditions are fulﬁlled by chance leading to
spurious counts. Let us estimate the rates of such counts for our model scanners.
Because of the small 3γ decay rate the probability of two or more 3γ events occurring
and being detected within the resolving time is very small. The main source of spurious
counts are the randomly coincident 2γ annihilation photons that are scattered or
partially detected, so that they fall within the energy range of the 3γ spectrum. Let
us denote by P (E
511) the probability of a 511 keV photon emitted from the phantom
to deposit the energy E in a detector.
It is actually a convolution of the spectrum
of photons leaving the phantom (primary and scattered) and the detector response
function. The probability of three coincident photons randomly fulﬁlling condition (2)
within the resolution determined window ∆E can be approximately written as

The rates of random 3γ events (ﬁgures 9 and 10) remain very low compared to true
3γ even at high activities, so they do not contribute signiﬁcantly to image noise. This
signal-to-noise ratio is, however, sensitive to the detection eﬃciency of the detectors and
may worsen signiﬁcantly for photopeak eﬃciencies lower than those assumed.

4.3. Examples of images and detectability of lesions

In order to generate examples of images we used the human scanner with the phantom
described in the previous section and added lesions in the form of spheres of variable
size, lined up across the centre of the phantom as shown in ﬁgure 11 (a). We deﬁne the
nb)/nb, where nl is the density of registered 3γ counts in
lesion contrast as c = (nl −
the lesion, and nb that in the background. In ﬁgure 11 a few examples of 3γ images are
shown. Image (b) corresponds to the maximum 3γ counting rate for the human scanner
of about 1000 cps (cf. ﬁgure 9) scanned for about 20 min. At contrast c = 3 the 1 cm
lesion is clearly visible, however the one of 0.5 cm diameter is not. When contrast drops
to c = 0.2 (c), the detectability of lesions deteriorates signiﬁcantly. On the other hand
the 1 cm lesion is still visible even if the count statistics is reduced by almost order of
magnitude (d).

Detectability of lesions clearly depends on their size and contrast. Let us examine
this dependence to assess the limits of three-photon imaging. In order for a lesion to
be distinguishable against the background its total number of points (counts) above the
background level, reduced by its possible statistical ﬂuctuations, should be signiﬁcantly
higher than the average statistical ﬂuctuation of the number of points in a background
region of the same size as the lesion. This can be expressed as

which was placed at the centre of the human scanner (cf. Table 1). The images are

V0 is the original volume of the lesion without the partial volume eﬀect. In the image,
however, the blurring due to ﬁnite resolution of the scanner has to be taken into account;
the blurred lesion volume is denoted by V . The parameters ξ and ξ1 specify what
“signiﬁcantly higher” actually mean, in other words they control the conﬁdence level
of our assessment. Here we assume ξ = ξ1 = 2, which corresponds roughly to 95%
conﬁdence level. For a spherical lesion equation (7) takes the form

The formula (8) works quite well for the simulated images. The calculated minimal
detectable sizes of lesions for the images in ﬁgure 11 are: (b) 6.2 mm, (c) 20.8 mm,
(d) 10 mm. For the model small animal scanner (spatial resolution 0.32 cm FWHM)
with 2 cm water phantom (section 4.2) of activity 50 MBq the 3γ counting rate can
reach over 50 kcps (see ﬁgure 10). With the much smaller phantom the count density is
106 c/cm3 in a 20 min. scan. Then sub-millimeter detectability is achieved
about 1.5
at contrasts > 0.7. At c = 3 lesions as small as 0.6 mm should be visible.

·

The formula (8) allows to ﬁne tune the trade-oﬀ between the resolution and number
of counts represented by the relation shown in ﬁgure 8. Depending on the contrast of
lesions, it may be of advantage to narrow the 3γ window, losing some of the counts
(decrease nb), but improving the spatial resolution (decrease σ) to achieve the best
detectability.

4.4. Attenuation

In 3γ imaging we unfortunately do not have the advantage of relatively easy attenuation
correction as in conventional 2γ PET, where the attenuation along any line of response
is constant, independent of the site of annihilation and can be measured directly by
a transmission scan. For each point in an object and each particular combination of
energies and emission directions of the three photons the attenuation factor will be
diﬀerent. The problem of attenuation correction is therefore rather complex, similar to
for example scatter correction in conventional PET or SPECT. Using Monte Carlo
simulations and having the map of attenuation coeﬃcients for the object one can
compute a map of attenuation factors for each point of the object averaged over the free
parameters of 3γ emission. The results for our water phantoms are shown in ﬁgure 13.

In general attenuation for 3γ photons is higher than for 2γ because of lower energies
and longer eﬀective paths. It is also strongly nonuniform, being signiﬁcantly higher for
points deep inside the body.

5. Outstanding questions and directions of future studies

In this paper we concentrated on the image quality and performance of the new 3γ PET
modality, leaving for future studies the question of biological and clinical signiﬁcance of
the information extracted from the three-photon annihilations. Precise measurements
of 3γ yields in biological samples are necessary to determine its variability in a living
organism, as well as sensitivity to parameters like the level of oxygen. Our results will

allow to assess whether the new information can be extracted by PET systems based
for example on CdZnTe detectors.

In our simulations we neglected the eﬀect of ﬁnite positron range and non-zero
residual momentum of the annihilating positron-electron pair. Both eﬀects add extra
blurring of magnitude similar to that for the two-photon case. That is in most cases
negligible in comparison to the eﬀects of detector size and energy resolution.

In our estimation of counting rates we did not consider the contribution of activity
outside the ﬁeld of view, which is important in conventional clinical PET. It would
add extra random 3γ counts. However, our calculations show (section 4.2) that for
the assumed scanner parameters the rate of random 3γ events is at least 3 orders of
magnitude lower than that of true 3γ. Extra activity contributing to randoms would
mean a shift on the randoms curves in ﬁgures 9 and 10 along the activity axis typically
It means that the random 3γ rate would still remain very small
by a factor of 2-4.
compared to the true 3γ and would not pose a real problem. The above is true for pure
positron emitters, which are most commonly used in PET. If there are nuclear gamma
photons accompanying positron emissions, the rate of triple coincidences and false 3γ
events may increase signiﬁcantly, although still most of them could be rejected due to
the energy conservation condition (1).

The limitations of 3γ imaging seem to be in the ﬁrst place the low number of
counts, especially with high attenuation (large patients, areas located deep in the
body), and the spatial resolution limited mainly by the energy resolution of detectors.
While one can not realistically do much to increase the counting rates achieved in
our model scanners (section 4.2), the spatial resolution leaves plenty of room for
improvement. One way would be to rectify the energy resolution of the detectors (see
section 4.1.1). Although the technology of room temperature semiconductor detectors is
making constant progress, we probably can not expect a signiﬁcant further improvement
in energy resolution compared to that assumed in our simulations. An alternative is to
use e.g. HP-Ge detectors oﬀering resolutions of the order of 0.3 %. However, the other
properties, and in particular the need for cryogenic cooling and cost make the choice
rather impractical at least for clinical PET. Their use for a dedicated small animal
PET system is, however, not excluded (Philips et al 2002). A much more feasible
way to improve the resolution of 3γ imaging is through the reconstruction process.
In this paper we used the simplest possible procedure by solving equations (1) for
each registered 3γ event and producing a “set of points” image. The easiest way to
improve resolution is by making use of the energy dependence of the positioning error
(ﬁgure 7) as indicated in section 4.1.5. Another possibility is to account for the unique
non-symmetric shape of the point spread function which can be calculated for each
combination of detected 3γ photons. It could be incorporated in the framework of a
statistical iterative reconstruction method like ML-EM (Shepp and Vardi 1982), known
to produce superior quality images, however, for the price of signiﬁcant complexity and
computation time.

6. Conclusions

We have studied thoroughly the main characteristics of three-photon imaging in positron
emission tomography. Clearly, it is one of the directions for future development of this
rapidly expanding imaging technique. The main prerequisite for the new modality to
be implemented is a scanner based on high energy resolution detectors, like CdZnTe.
This is no longer a futuristic dream. Several groups and manufacturers’ laboratories
are working on such devices, and probably within the next few years we will see ﬁrst
prototypes in practical use.

Our simulations show that for typical scanner conﬁgurations, with currently
available CdZnTe detector properties, good quality 3γ annihilation images can be
obtained. They do not match those from conventional PET in terms of spatial resolution
and statistics, however they may contain distinct new information for example about the
oxygenation of tissues. It could be obtained alongside any routine scan, e.g. FDG PET,
using photons that are currently wasted, so it is certainly worth further exploration.

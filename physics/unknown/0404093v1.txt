In order to discern aggregation in solution, we present a quantum mechanical analogue of the

photon statistics from ﬂuorescent molecules diﬀusing through a focused beam. A novel generating

functional is developed to fully describe the experimental physical system, as well as the statistics.

Histograms of the measured time delay between photon counts are ﬁt by an analytical solution

describing the static as well as diﬀusing regimes. To determine empirical ﬁtting parameters, ﬂuo-

rescence correlation spectroscopy is used in parallel to the photon counting. For expediant analysis,

we ﬁnd that the distribution’s deviation from a single Poisson shows a diﬀerence between two single

ﬂuor monomers or a double ﬂuor aggregate of the same total intensities. Initial studies were pre-

formed on ﬁxed-state aggregates limited to dimerization. However preliminary results on reactive

species suggest that the method can be used to characterize any aggregating system.

I. INTRODUCTION

Aggregation and cooperative binding are fundamental to biological function and regulation, but diﬃcult to observe

at the few molecule level. Recent advances in few molecule solution spectroscopy have been achieved by combining

the comparitively large signals of ﬂuorescence with recent technological advances in photon counting (e.g. low noise

detectors). One powerful technique, ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), has enabled researchers to observe

many small ensemble processes such as diﬀusion [2], molecular conformational dynamics [3], and reaction kinetics

[4]. In FCS, ﬂuctuations in ﬂuorescence intensity are temporally correlated to reveal the timescale of the underlying

ﬂuctuation source. In the simplest case, this could be the diﬀusion timescale of a ﬂuorescent molecule through a

sampling volume. However, it is diﬃcult to discern aggregation based on the diﬀusion time alone since the increase

in diﬀusion time between a monomer or a dimer is weakly dependent on the increase in eﬀective radius (

< r2 >1/2

∝

for hard spheres) [5].

An alternative approach to FCS is the statistical analysis of the time series of emitted photons (number counting

Fig 1), since the number distribution of photons in the detection volume at any given moment is diﬀerent for species of

diﬀerent quantum yield or ﬂuorophore number. This analysis, called photon number counting histogram analysis [7,8]

was originally developed to detect the “brightness” per particle, but relied on the static (non-diﬀusing) limit. However

in experiment, several factors potentially overshadow the speciﬁc brightness signature of a ﬂuor, such as triplet states,

bleaching, or quenching. We propose a new method of analysis, the time delay histogram, to discern small diﬀerences

in a specie’s ﬂuorescence complemented by diﬀerences in diﬀusive behavior. The time delay histogram is constructed

of the time between successive photon counts (Fig 1). Unlike counting the number of events per time bin, this type of

counting allows us to extract additional information about the diﬀusion. Conceptually, as more ﬂuorinated monomers

aggregate, the ﬂuorophores sample the detection volume in bunches. This increases the chance of a large time interval

between two successive emission photons and the large ∆t tail of the time delay histogram has an increased frequency.

To extract the information on the structural change, we have developed a generating functional to unify diﬀerent

statistical aspects of the photon time series. This functional is modeled as a transition matrix element of a ﬁctitious

quantum mechanical system with time variable continuated to the imaginary axis. Many well developed techniques

in quantum mechanics are borrowed to derive analytical expressions for other experimental observables such as the

auto correlation function. Our approach is complementary to the description model proposed by Novikov and Boens

[9] for the photon counting histogram. An extension of our functional can also be applied to modern multi-channel

techniques [10,11] as well as the incorporation of secondary processes such as triplet states, bleaching, quenching, and

chemical reaction kinetics.

Recently Kask, et.al also proposed a method to extract the diﬀusion signature of a particle through ﬂuorescence

intensity multiple distribution analysis (FIMDA) [11]. In FIMDA, many histograms are constructed from the same

time trace as the bin size is varied. In contrast, the time delay histogram we propose, contains the diﬀusion signature

of the aggregate in a single histogram. At small time delays (less than the diﬀusion time through the collection

volume) we are sensitive to the rate of photons emitted per object, and at greater delays, diﬀusion dominates the

statistics. Finally, we oﬀer a complementary technique to FIMDA using the Mandel Q parameter [1] to expediantly

extract diﬀusion information from number counting distributions. The power of this technique could be increased

by greater photon collection capabilities, leading to better statistics and ultimately better discrimination, including

higher moments, in the large delay limit.

To demonstrate the sensitivity of our analysis, we choose a case where the diﬀerence in diﬀusion times are negligible.

A particularly diﬃcult case is the discrimination of two monomers of identical ﬂuorescence from a single dimer with the

sum of their ﬂuorescence. Although both have the same average rate of emitted photons, they sample the excitation

beam proﬁle diﬀerently as they diﬀuse (inhomogeneous intensity proﬁle of a focused beam). For the experiment, a

sequence of single stranded DNA is speciﬁcally tagged with either one or two ﬂuorophores per strand. The single dyed

strands will be considered “monomers” and the doubled tagged as “dimers”. For all cases, we ﬁnd good discrimination

between samples of a given concentration of dimers versus that of twice the concentration of monomers, where both

samples have the same average ﬂuorescence.

II. OVERVIEW OF APPROACH

The time series of photon events may be described by the instantaneous ﬂuorescence intensity,

where t1, t2, ..., tn, ...tN corresponds to the tick marks of Fig.1 with N total number of photons counted and ǫ is the

detector resolution. δǫ(t

In the current literature statistical analysis tends to be limited to the average intensity,

and various types of correlation functions, the most familiar being the auto-correlation function

subtraction of δǫ permits A(t) to vanish for all τ for a Poissonian histogram. Dividing the integration time into Nb bins

of equal time interval τb, i.e., T = Nbτb, the number of photon counts falling within the time bins are m1, m2, ..., mNb,

and their moments

carry the structural information of the underlying ﬂuorescence molecules. The quantity for comparison, called the

Mandel’s Q parameter is deﬁned as

Similar relations exist between higher order correlation functions and higher order binning moments.

Finally we describe the time delay histogram of the distribution of time intervals between two successive photon

events, i.e. ∆t1, ∆t2,.... For suﬃciently large numbers of photon counts, a distribution function of ∆t, ρ(∆t) can be

extracted and is analogous to the photon waiting time distribution of quantum optics. [6] The theory of this function

will be developed in the sections IV and V and will be compared with experimental results in sections V and VI.

III. A MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF TIME DELAY HISTOGRAM

While there exist many articles in the literature on the mathematical properties of the photon event histogram

[7,8], here we would like to provide a uniﬁed approach, which ties the experimental observables such as ﬂuorescence

intensity, auto-correlation, the binning moments, and time delay histogram to a probability generating functional.

To begin, we divide the integration time T into

bins, each of interval ǫ, i.e., T =

ǫ. Each ﬂuorescence diﬀusion

N

process produces a histogram of photon counting,

m1, ..., m

, with ml the number of photon events within the l-th

time bin and the corresponding ﬂuorescence intensity given by

which is properly normalized, i.e.

z1, ..., z

and

I1, ..., I

become two functions of t, z(t) and I(t), such that z(lǫ) = zl and I(lǫ) = Il.

In particular, as ǫ

0, most m’s vanish, few of them are equal to one, and the probability of ml > 2 becomes

the generating function (4.2) becomes a generating functional

[z(t)] = lim

(z1, ..., z

).

The function C1(t) is nothing but the ensemble average of the instantaneous ﬂuorescence intensity at the moment t,

A(t1, t2) =

and the coeﬃcients Cn(t1, ..., tn)’s represent higher order correlations. For the observation times, t1, ..., t

on time diﬀerences. In particular, C1(t) becomes a constant and C(t1, t2) depends only on the τ = t2 −

B. A Quantum Mechanical Analog

The formulation we have established thus far is completely general, and independent of details of the ﬂuorescence

diﬀusion process. We shall now include the details of the physical process and model the generating functional

[z(t)].

G

Consider N molecules, each having a speciﬁc brightness, and diﬀusing in a solution of total volume Ω. Both Ω

and N

Ω . An axially symmetric intensity proﬁle is created by focusing the

laser beam within the sample solution. While ﬂuorescence occurs everywhere along the beam volume, the pinhole

eﬀectively eliminates the collection of photons emitted far away from the focal point [12] and a small detection

volume is deﬁned, which contains few molecules in average at all times. In the absence of chemical reactions (no self

hybridization), suﬃciently weak laser intensity and suﬃciently low concentrations, we may assume that i) N molecules

do not interact with each other; ii) photon emissions are statistically independent in the absence of diﬀusion; and

iii) the photon emission frequency per ﬂuorophore within the detection volume is λ0u(~r). u(~r) will be referred to as

the ﬂuorescence proﬁle function and is normalized by the condition u(0)

uMax.(~r) = 1. Under these assumptions,

≡

the probability generating functional takes the same mathematical expression of the transition matrix element of a

quantum mechanical system of N noninteracting bosons in an external potential ﬁeld and imaginary time, i.e.

1). The Hamiltonian operator (4.14) describes the motion of a particle of mass (2D)−

−

turbative expansion according to the powers of 1

z(t), which generates the correlation functions to all orders. The

−

second is the expansion according to the powers of the diﬀusion constant, D, which is particularly useful for FCS with

biological molecules. The leading order of the second expansion corresponds to the frozen limit in the literature [7,8]

and we are able to add the higher order corrections systematically following this quantum mechanical analog.

2). It follows from (4.11) and (4.14) that the generating functional responsible for the observed time delay his-

togram,

Geﬀ.[z(t)], assumes the identical mathematical form as

[z(t)], provided λ is replaced by λeﬀ. = ηλ. In what

follows, we shall refer exclusively to

Geﬀ.[z(t)] with the subscript “eﬀ.” suppressed.

C. Generalization to Multi-species and Multi-channels

We generalize the present formulation to include several species of ﬂuorescent molecules with multiple channels of

where λlα(~r) the proﬁle function speciﬁc to the lth species and αth channel, and it becomes λu(~r) for a single species

depends on several arbitrary functions zα(t). The power series expansion according to 1

zα(t)’s yields all the

−

corresponding correlation functions. Unlike number counting in the frozen limit, it can be factorized into individual

detecting channels for nonzero diﬀusion constants.

IV. ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS FOR DATA ANALYSIS

In this section, we shall display the analytical expressions for ﬂuorescence intensity, the auto-correlation function,

Mandel’s Q parameter and the ∆t distribution, as derived from the general formulation of the previous section. The

technical details of the derivation are deferred to the Appendix C.

A. Fluorescence intensity, correlation functions and the binning statistics

I = cλ

where n = cv with v

d3~ru(~r). The integration v can be viewed as the eﬀective collection volume deﬁned by the

V. EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS AND METHODS

To create well-deﬁned single or double ﬂuor elements, short pieces of single stranded DNA (ssDNA) were used as

substrates. Either one or two ﬂuorophores can be site-speciﬁcally coupled to each DNA oligomer, (29 bases in length)

dependent on the number of end-strand modiﬁcations (primary amino linker arms, Midland Certiﬁed Reagent Co.).

Succidinmyl ester Rhodamine 6G (Molecular Probes) was coupled to the modiﬁed sites in the presence of DMF, and

puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration and reverse phases chromatography (HPLC).

The experimental setup (Fig.2) is an inverted confocal microscopy arrangement. The sample is illuminated by the

514.5nm line of a Ar+ laser (Lexel 85) focused through a 60x water immersion objective (numerical aperature 1.2,

Olympus). Incident power was empirically optimized at 100µW, so that the photon counts per aggregate were at

least 50,000 cps, while avoiding signiﬁcant population of the triplet state or bleaching. Emitted photons are collected

through the same objective, directed through a high-pass dichroic mirror (Omega Optical) and a notch ﬁlter (Kaiser

Optical) to reduce collection of on-axis elastically scattered photons. The collection volume is further reﬁned by

focusing the light onto a 25µm pinhole, eliminating oﬀ angle scattering as well as spatially deﬁning the collection

volume. The collection volume was empirically determined though the number of molecules measured through FCS

as a function of increasing concentration. All FCS measurements were 10 minutes in duration using a ALV 5000 E

board for data collection and in-house data analysis software for ﬁtting. The overall detection eﬃciency of the setup

is estimated to be 3 percent. Photons are detected by a counting avalanche photodiode (EG&G/Perkin Elmer),

pulsewidth 25ns whose signal is processed by task speciﬁc counting board (NI-TIO 6602 National Instruments),

controlled by LabVIEW. The period between each photon is measured by counting the number of external clock

(4MHz) pulses(source) between each photon pulse (gate). 216 photons are collected for each trial. Data acquisition

technology limited the total collection time to 1-2s, depending on the incident intensity. Afterpulsing artifacts from

the photodiodes were measured

100ns, with comparison to cross-correlation of the same signal in two perpendicular

∼

detectors. Digital ﬁltering was used to subtract the afterpulsing noise from the ﬁnal histogram statistics. DNA

concentrations are

nM in PBS buﬀer such that only one monomer molecule at any time is within the collection

∼

volume.

Photon counting data is collected as ﬂuorescent particles diﬀuse through the sample volume. When the particles

are outside the volume they are dark and undetectable. As they enter the volume they are excited with a certain

probability and emit a temporal pattern of photons that are detected by a counter. Given a long integration time,

many particles diﬀuse through the volume producing temporal ﬂuctuations in ﬂuorescence. Whereas the autocorre-

lation function reveals the timescale of these ﬂuorescence ﬂuctuations, the probability distribution characterizes their

amplitude.

VI. RESULTS

Photon counting data was collected for two systems, and the time delay histogram constructed for each (Fig 3).

Both samples consist of very dilute (nM) identical sequences of ssDNA in buﬀer, and observations were made at room

temperature ( 25 ◦C). We consider these systems noninteracting. In the ﬁrst sample, speciﬁcally single end-labeled

ssDNA was diluted to an average concentration of 1 molecule per collection beam volume at any time. The number of

molecules was calculated from calibration of the collection volume (see Methods) at 100µW incident power (0.35µm3).

The second sample contained the same sequence ssDNA however tagged with two ﬂuorophores per object (one at

each end). This sample was then diluted so that the average intensity in time of the two samples were equal.

If

the dimer system was exactly twice the ﬂuorescence of the monomer, then the dimer concentration should be 0.5

that of the monomer for the same given intensity. However, due to local quenching eﬀects of the ﬂuorophore, the

average concentration of double-dyed molecules in the beam at any time was calculated to be 0.7 to maintain the

same intensity. The empirical volume of the beam was calibrated from a serial dilution of a standard dye solution,

and the rate of emitted photons per ﬂuor,λ, measured. 1/λ = 1/60kHz. Concentrations of single/double ﬂuorescent

aggregates in the beam were 1 and 0.7 molecules respectively.

Empirical measurements demonstrated the quenching could be minimized by hybridization of the ssDNA to a

non-ﬂuorescent target. Hybridization of such a short segment (below the persistent length of dsDNA) forces the two

ﬂuorophores farther apart, minimizing dye-dye interaction. However, double-dyed molecules never demonstrated a

full factor of 2 increase in ﬂuorescence over their single-dyed conterparts. We suspect local quenching interaction of

the ﬂuor with the nearby base of the target strand.

The characteristic diﬀusion time through the sampling volume was extracted from the decay of the autocorrelation

function. Due to the resolution of our correlator software (10−

8s

10−

2s), we are most sensitive to the diﬀusion

−

across the short axis of the beam proﬁle. Hence, the characteristic time extracted from time correlation of the data

is most representative of τ

substituted into the theoretical formula for for both single-dyed and double-dyed molecules.

At ﬁrst glance, the two distributions of Fig.3 are completely indistinguishable. However upon closer examination

it is possible to see the two curves slowly diverge at large ∆t with the double dye data falls slightly above the single

dye data. The comparison between the analytical expression of the time delay histograms with large and small ∆t

approximations (5.20) and (5.21) is shown in Fig.4, where the ratio of the experimental histogram to the theoretical

one is plotted versus the time delay ∆t. It is evident that the formula (5.19) together with the approximation (5.17),

denoted as ρtheory(∆t) in the Figures, is robust for single (A) and double dyed (C) samples. (B) and (D) are exploded

views of the small ∆t domain of each histogram. The curve labeled by “linear” or “quadratic” corresponds to the

theoretical formula (5.21) with terms beyond linear or quadratic truncated. The quality of the agreement is improved

from the linear truncation to the quadratic truncation. The curve labeled by “Poisson” corresponds to ρtheor.(∆t)

given by a Poissonian, i.e. ln ρtheor.(∆t) = ln ρtheor.(0)

λ∆t, which is clearly a poor description of the experimental

−

histogram.

Although these simulations successfully diﬀerentiate the two systems, the analysis is somewhat cumbersome. A

common mathematical technique to highlight the subtle diﬀerences in distributions is moment analysis. Similar

techniques have proven useful in ﬂuctuation spectroscopy [14–16]. The ﬁrst moment is the mean, the second moment

the standard deviation, the third the skewness, etc.

Returning to Fig.3, we note a profound diﬀerence between the experimental data and a single Poissonian process.

The straight lines represent two hypothetical single Poission systems with diﬀerent timescales. For the simple detection

of emitted photons within a ﬁxed volume one might expect the statistics to resemble a single Poissonian process. [17]

However, when the particles are allowed to diﬀuse through the boundaries of the volume, an additional Poissonian

process contributes to the overall photon statistics. [18,19] Not only must we account for the stochastic nature of the

emission process, we must also consider the number distribution of aggregates passing into the beam volume from the

larger sample reservoir. The statistics of the time series of the photon counting can be highlighted through Mandel’s

Q parameter (Eqn 2.5) introduced in section II.

We develop the binning moment as a complementary technique to FIMDA. In FIMDA [11] each histogram is

representative of the number count distribution using a certain binning window size. For every change in binning

window size, a new histogram is constructed. Likewise, every histogram has its own unique set of moments. All

ﬁrst moments should be equal to the product of the average intensity and the the window size and will not show

any diﬀerence between the two systems (single dye and double dye) in accordance with the experimental procedure

described in the ﬁrst paragraph of this section. Starting with the second moment, the diﬀerence between the two

system emerges.

In Fig 5, we plot the second moment normalized according to (2.5) for both system and the

corresponding theoretical curve given by (5.13). The data for the two systems are clearly distinguishable and agree

well with the theoretical prediction.

If the photon histogram were a single Poissonian, all correlations as well as the Q parameter would vanish. Therefore

the correlation functions and the Q parameter measure the deviation of the photon histogram from a Poissonian.

Recall that the time-delay histogram is essentially the result of a two Poissonian processes. If we re-examine Fig

3 (although it is a time delay, not number counting histogram) and focus on the dashed line through the short ∆t

domain, divergence from the single Poisson increases as ∆t increases. For binning windows smaller than the diﬀusion

time, the statistics are primarily due to the intrinsic ﬂuorescence of the ﬂuorophore. Since both systems contain 2

ﬂuors, the two distributions vary little in this domain. At longer times, each molecule samples the inhomogeneous

beam proﬁle as it diﬀuses. Hence the diﬀusion dependent statistics dominate the long time domain and are responsible

for the notably diﬀerent Q parameters of the samples.

VII. SECONDARY EFFECTS

In traditional ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy, triplet state eﬀects and various quenching processes are the

principal mechanisms that overshadow structural information. To parse out these contributions, one may need to

explore the higher binning moments than have been examined in this work. Our mathematical formulation provides

the complete systematics for this purpose. Such secondary eﬀects introduce additional timescales to the problem

(not simply the ﬂuorescence rate and the diﬀusion time to cross the collection volume discussed in this paper). Also,

some details of the electronic transition inside a ﬂuorophore should be addressed. This modeling can be achieved by

enlarging the quantum mechanical analog with a multi-component wave function ψi and a matrix Hamiltonian

In principle, such an elaboration should also be implemented in the absence of triplet state eﬀects and quenching

processes, since the ﬂuorescence rate combines the excitation rate from the ground state and the spontaneous emission

rate from the excitation levels. For two electronic levels with ’0’ labeling the ground state and ’1’ the excitation state,

we have W01 = λu(~r) and W10 = λs, Einstein’s A-coeﬃcient. The Schroedinger equation (4.18) is split into two

the excitation rate is 60/3%=2MHz, and the corresponding ﬂuorescence time is 500ns, much longer than the typical

spontaneous emission time, 10ns. Our approximation is therefore adequate.

VIII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have developed a mathematical formulation to analyze the time delay series of ﬂuorescence photons from

diﬀusing particles, based on a probability generating functional and its quantum mechanical analog. Although it may

appear formal, since some analytical expressions such as the auto-correlation function have been obtained by less

sophisticated means, the approach is systematic. The potential of this general approach will be realized when dealing

with systems of greater complexity, e.g. in the presence of the chemical reaction discussed below.

We have designed an experiment to diﬀerentiate ﬂuorescent aggregates in solution. ssDNA monomers are labeled

with a single ﬂuorophore and dimers with two ﬂuorophores. Secondary eﬀects such as chemical reactions, triplet state

eﬀects and various quenching processes have been neglected in our model. However these eﬀects have been minimized

by using dilute solutions to avoid self-interaction and Rhodamine 6G, a ﬂuorophore with little triplet state at low

incident intensities.

Although we have only addressed ideal experimental conditions of the non-reacting case in this manuscript, typical

biological/chemical systems react (aggregation or cooperative binding). Our technique can be modiﬁed to include

(8.1)

(8.2)

these reactions. One must generalize the quantum mechanical analog to the case with several species of particles,

each representing a ﬂuorescence molecule, interacting with each other. Without going to technical details which will

be reported elsewhere, we quote the generalization of our formulation analog in the presence of a binary reaction,

the creation/annihilation operators of a molecule of species A or B. DA(B) and λA(B) are the diﬀusion constant and

molecule, the second term represents the creation of a pair of A-molecules, the third term signiﬁes the annihilation of

denotes the reaction rate in each direction of (8.1). In physics, the Hamiltonian (8.2) describes a system of interacting

bosons of two species. The equilibrium state of the ﬂuorescence-diﬀusion-reaction process will be analogous to the

ground state which carries a Bose condensate. The proportion of each species in the condensate is determined by

the mass-action law and the ﬂuctuations are calculatable with well developed ﬁeld theoretic method. In terms of the

generating functional (4.2) and the functional derivative (4.4), we are able to calculate various correlation functions

of the photon counting histogram in the presence of chemical reactions using techniques developed in quantum ﬁeld

theory. This approach is expected to be more systematic than the conventional reaction kinetics.

A.1 The derivation of the formulae for distribution function of the time delay histogram.

To derive the ∆t distribution (the distribution function of the time interval between two successive photon emis-

sions), we start with the case with ﬁnite time bins (ǫ is suﬃciently small that the probability of more than one photons

within a bin can be ignored.) and look for the probability of one photon event in nth-bin, one photon event in (n + l)th

bin with ∆t = (l

1)ǫ and no photon in the bins between them. Up to a normalization constant, the probability is

Taking the limit of inﬁnitesimal bins, i.e., ǫ

0 at ﬁxed T and ∆t, we obtain the desired distribution function (4.7).

1. Schematic of a photon counting trace. Traditional photon counting divides the total integration time into bins,

counting the number that fall into each. We propose a new type of counting based on the time delay between two

successive photon counts.

2. Schematic of the photon counting setup. OBJ=objective, DM=dichroic mirror, NF=Notch Filter, PH=Pinhole,

APD=Avalanche Photodiode, CB=Counting Board, CO=Correlator Board

3. The time-delay histograms for single (black) and double (grey) labeled ssDNA. The resulting distributions from a

single Poisson processes are shown by the straight lines for comparison.

4. (A)large ∆t single ﬂuor, (B)small ∆t single ﬂuor, (C)large ∆t double ﬂuor, (D)small ∆t double ﬂuor. (Solid)

Poisson, (short dash) linear, and (long dash) quadratic ﬁts are shown for comparison in the short time limits.

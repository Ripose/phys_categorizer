The  equation  of  state  for  a  gas  stream  as  analog  of  well-known  equation  of 
state of gas medium in the static conditions is submitted. The connection of pa-
rameters of state and motion, and also the volume-flow rate and the mass-flow 
rate of the gas stream during change of its temperature and pressure as the re-
sult of external action is shown on example of modification of the represented 
equation.

The  history  of  development  of  gas  equation  well-known  by  B.Clapeyron  and  D.Mendeleyev 
names includes more than the 200-years period (1661- 1874). However, the deep sense and sig-
nificance of this law can be understood only now in the end of the ХХ century under the solution 
one of the classical problems of physics - development of the apparatus for description and quan-
titative evaluation of state and motion of gas stream and for simulation of fluid motion generally. 
This law which generalizes the special gas laws was determined methodologically in the context 
of  the  continual  consideration  of  gas  medium  and  phenomenologically  -  on  the  basis  of  direct 
experiment. Thus the level of generalizing is determined in not a smaller degree also by reflec-
tion in it of the mechanical equivalent of heat in the form of the gas constant (universal or spe-
cific) and connection with quantity of the substance. 
It is remarkably that three special gas laws – R.Boyle and E.Mariotte, J.Charles, J.Charles and 
J.Gay-Lussac – was determined historically in sequence from a simple to a complex. 
The  importance  of  the  first  gas  law  established  by  R.Boyle  (1661)  and  E.Mariotte  (1676): 
,  along  with  quantitative  expression,  consists  in  fundamentality  of

the approach, associated with concept of a compressibility as the property of bodies and medi-
ums to change its volume and form under loading and elasticity as ability to recover initial vol-
ume and form at unloading. Besides, the conditions of holding of experiment (T = const) ensured 
the greatest universality of the approach to the test object. As Boyle wrote himself: «Both Pas-
cal’s experiments and experiments of our English friend (R.Hooke) were demonstrated that than 
greater weight acts to the air, all the more strong becomes its tendency to expansion and, there-
fore, its resisting strength (similarly to spring plates, which one become more strong, when them 
incurvate  by  the  larger  loads).»  The  approach  is  one  both  to  the  air,  and  to  the  spring  plates: 
T=const.  The  fundamentality  of  Boyle’s  conceptual  system,  including  such  categories  as  com-
pressibility, elasticity, undoubtedly, has formed the basis for determination of Hooke’s law of an 
elasticity conformably to a tension of solid bodies.  
The first law, as well as both following special gas laws, was determined at experiment with the 
fixed quantity of the gas placed in vessel hermetically closed by piston. In this connection, all 
three special gas laws are applicable to so-called closed-loop systems with fixed amount of gas 
medium.  
The Boyle experiment conducted under stationary temperature characterizes the isothermal proc-
ess of the pressure changing and volume of the given amount of gas. The isothermal change in 
modern thermodynamic interpretation is implemented at heating up of gas with a simultaneous 
external action (its expansion), at which one all heat injected toward gas is compensated by an 
expansion work ensuring an invariability of the reference temperature of the gas and its internal 
energy.

Later 15 years after Boyle’s experiments, the first special gas law was established by Mariotte on 
the  basis  of  self-maintained  vast  investigations  predominantly  of  gas  medium  (though  the 
Mariotte's formula for an estimate of stresses in a thin-wall cylindrical shell under action of pres-
sure of fluid medium also occupies the substantial place in the strength theory.) 
The second special gas law was established by J.Charles in 1787 and has two forms of writing:

vessel of invariable volume the heating up of gas leads to pressure increase so, that the ratio of 
the pressures is equal to the ratio of temperatures. The Charles's law, as well as the first special 
gas law, is an evidence of reversibility of behavior of gas, that is of its elasticity. 
Process, which realizes in gas medium under invariable volume, is called the isochoric process 
in  modern  thermodynamic  interpretation.  The  constancy  not  only  volume  of  gas,  but  also  its 
amount  and,  ultimately,  of  its  weight  density  is typical for such process. All added heat is ex-
pended on heating of gas in this process that is on increase of its internal energy. 
The third special gas law was established, as well as first law, twice and with the same differnce 
in years: in 1787 by J.Charles (is not published in time) and later 15 years, in 1802 by J.Gay-
Lussac  and  has  two  forms  of  writing  similarly  to  the  second  law:  V
,  where 
α =1/273 K-1 = αp, and 
T =
This law implies, that for given and invariable amount of gas in the vessel, the volume of which 
can be changed, the heating up of gas leads to increase of its volume so, that the ratio of volumes 
is  equal  to  the  ratio  of  temperatures  under  constant  pressure.  Here  again,  the  gas  medium  be-
haves elastically, as in two previous laws. It is typical for isobaric process in modern thermody-
namic  interpretation,  that  at  heating  up  of  invariable  amount  of  gas  is  possible  to  ensure  con-
stancy of pressure in it by the resolution of free (thermal) expansion.  
Gay-Lussac has attempted to unify the special gas laws in one generalized, taking into account 
the boundedness of effective parameters (Т, p, V) and the unity of the tested medium. In result in 
. It is attested, that the phenomenological char-
1826, he has received expression: 
acter of the special laws does not contain conceptual component permitting to uncover sense and 
magnitude of constant in right member of the equation. 
The following attempt of a deduction of a generalized gas law was belonged by B.Clapeyron. In 
⋅
1839 he has received  pV = BT and in 1840: 
, where В – proportionality constant, 
TVp
М - weight of gas. 
The opportunities of deriving of the generalized gas law by results of experiments with gas me-
dium and by means of phenomenological approaches to problem were exhausted. 
In the beginning of the second half of the XVIII century, J.Black has clearly explained the law of 
thermal equilibrium in parallel with the above mentioned investigations. In 1760, he has intro-
duced  the  notion  of  heat  capacity  of  bodies  and  mediums.  To  1813  F.Delaroche  and  J.Berard 
have realized the first precise measurements of specific heats of gases. The results of these ex-
periments boosted development of ideas about a possibility to make the work by gas at the ex-
pense  of  its  internal  energy  at  absence  of  thermal  action  from  the  outside.  In  1816  P.Laplace, 
comparing  heat  capacities  of  isochoric  by  Charles's  and  isobaric  by  Charles  and  Gay-Lussac's 
processes, has determined their inequality that in isobaric process the heat capacity of gas is big-
 time. In result, in 1816 Laplace has resulted to the final form the formula for

on the basis of the Boyle's law and E.Torricelli's formula in form: 
The invention of the pneumatic fire in France in 1803, Gay-Lussac's experiments by compres-
sion and expansion, and also transflow of gas in the heat-insulated vessels have resulted to the 
concept of adiabatic process in 1807 and linkage of thermal energy with work of the expansion 
and compression of gas. In result, in 1823 S.Poisson has deduced the equation of adiabatic proc-

Investigation  of  properties  of  adiabatic  process  and  the  knowledge  of  Newton’s  and  Laplace’s 
approaches to the Torricelli's formula have allowed to deduce the formula for the outflow of the 
gas medium to the gas medium with the relative counterpressure 
 by B.Saint-Venant and 
P.Wantzel to 1839:

The analysis of this formula has allowed to elucidate such substantial features of gas motion, as 
baro-subcritical, baro-overcritical outflow and outflow into empty space. However given formula 
has not wished to feature flow of gas in the real flowing element, and especially in the flowing 
system, even in absence of heat exchange and any physical actions. The coefficients of velocity 
and the mass-flow rate was added to it as it is accepted in hydromechanics, adiabatic process was 
exchanged by the polytrope - all vainly. Only today, later 150 years, the belladonna-formula has 
uncovered the true sense [1]. 
In the first half of the XIX century the development of the elementary bases of thermodynamics 
happened parallel with upbuilding of knowledge about the gas laws. In 1842 J.Mayer search out 
the expression for mechanical equivalent of heat which is equally indispensable for generalizing 
the  gas  laws  and  for  development  of  thermodynamics  c

This appearance has passed quietly enough and almost not influenced to the problem of the gas 
motion.  At  all  events,  the  scientific  association  has  understood  that  this  equation  result  in  the 
radical improvement in the gas dynamics neither in itself nor in combination with the fundamen-
tal Torricelli - Saint-Venant - Wantzel's formula nor in combination with the formalistic line of 
J.D'alembert - L.Euler - J.Lagrange - L.Navier - S.Poisson - G.Stokes and was perceived enough 
indifferently. And 120 years later, it turned out, that the given generalized equation requires de-
velopment with the purpose of it application for description of gas stream motion.  
This equation is rather productive conformably to the concrete circumstances. At the same time, 
it is very important whether we understand physics of processes in gas stream and significance 
of this equation for its description. It expressed condition of state of motionless gas medium un-
der thermal action in a closed-loop system. As applied to open systems, for example, in the form 
of the flowing element (pipe), we gain again three special gas laws, having accepted the weight 
flow and the volume-flow rate of gas stream instead of weight and volume of motionless gas ac-

The obtained dependences are valid for the stationary steady flows of gas medium and allow to 
establish the type of the process realized in gas flow, depending on the separate or combined ac-
tion of heat flow and pressure on gas stream. The action by pressure in this case means its in-
crease or decrease simultaneously and equally in spaces of the inlet and outlet surrounding the 
flowing element, system. According to the dependence (1a), the increase or decrease of the pres-
sure  in  the  above  indicated  spaces  calls  change  of  correlation  of  the  volume-flow  rate  and  the 
mass-flow rate, compensating the action of pressure so, that the isothermal change is ensured in 
gas stream. For example, the gas stream mass-flow rate in flowing element, system under action 
of increased pressure is incremented and the volume-flow rate (velocity) of a stream is dimin-
ished ensuring an invariability of temperature of gas in a stream, i.e. its the isothermal state. 
According  to  the  dependence  (3a),  the  action  with  heat  flow  to  gas  stream  is  accompanied  by 
respective change of correlation of the volume-flow rate and mass-flow rate so, that the isobaric 
process is ensured in a gas stream. For example, the gas stream mass-flow rate under action of 
heating is diminished and volume-flow rate (velocity) of gas stream is being increased ensuring 
an invariability of pressure in gas stream, i.e. its the isobaric state. 
According  to  the  dependence  (2a),  the  change  of  mass-flow  rate  happens  so,  that  the  volume-
flow rate (velocity) of stream is remained fixed under action simultaneously both of heat flow 
and pressure on gas stream. For example, the volume-flow rate and the mass-flow rate (velocity) 
will remain invariable under heating of stream and the simultaneous equivalent recompression in 
surrounding spaces of the flowing element, system. The lowering of mass-flow rate will happen 
if the thermal factor will predominate over the pressure, and the volume-flow rate (velocity) of 
stream will remain former in this case. If the factor of pressure will predominate over the thermal 
action, the mass-flow rate of stream will increase exactly so, as far as it is necessary that the vol-
ume-flow rate (velocity) of stream has remained invariable. In any of these cases, the analogy of 
state  of  gas  stream  with  isochoric  process  in  static  conditions  is  remained  for  the  dependence 
(2a).

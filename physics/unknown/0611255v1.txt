Abstract:  
Intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy (ICLAS) with an evacuated Cr2+: ZnSe 
laser  is  performed  with  a  high-resolution  time-resolved  Fourier  transform 
interferometer with a minimum detectable absorption coefficient equal to 4 10-9 
cm-1  Hz-1/2  in  the  2.5µm  region.  This  represents  the  extreme  limit  presently 
reached  in  the  infrared  by  ICLAS  with  Doppler  limited  resolution.  The  broad 
gain  band  of  the  crystal  allows  a  spectral  coverage  at  most  equal  to  125  nm, 
wide enough to see entire vibration bands. Weak CO2 bands observed up to now 
only in the Venus atmosphere are recorded for the first time in a laboratory. H2O 
detection limit down to 0.9 ppbv is also demonstrated.

High  sensitivity  spectroscopic  detection  is  of  special  importance  for  trace  gas  sensing 
applications  which  have  an  increasing  impact  in  numerous  areas  including  fundamental 
spectroscopy,  atmospheric  chemistry,  industrial  process,  and  medical  diagnostics.  The  infrared 
spectral region has the considerable advantage to be the location of relatively strong absorption 
molecular bands. These allow a better minimum detectable absorption coefficient, approximated 
as the inverse of the product L x SNR, where L is the absorption length and SNR is the signal to 
noise ratio of the measurement. Detection limits down to sub ppb (parts-per-billion) have been 
achieved  with  photoacoustic1,2  and  cavity  ringdown3  sensitive  techniques.  The  tunable  lasers 
used  by  these  techniques  do  not  allow  simultaneous  coverage  of  broad  spectral  ranges.  More 
importantly,  broadband  detection  is  required  when  there  is  a  need  to  selectively  detect  several 
molecular gas species simultaneously by means of high sensitivity absorption spectroscopy. 

Intracavity  laser  absorption  spectroscopy  (ICLAS)4  has  been  known  for  a  long  time  as  a 
useful  approach  to  the  absorption  technique.  It provides  one  of  the  highest  sensitivity  with  the 
additional  advantage  of  a  simultaneous  coverage  of  a  broad  spectral  range  similar  to  the  laser 
gain bandwidth. ICLAS consists of placing the absorbing sample inside a laser cavity, the gain of 
which is broader than the sample absorption lines. Since only broadband losses are compensated 
by the laser gain, the laser operates for the absorption lines like a multipass cell. The equivalent 
absorption path length L is equal to the product of the velocity of light c by the generation time 
tg,  which  separates  the  beginning  of  the  laser  pulse  from  the  observation.  Various  laser  gain 
media have been used mainly for applications in the visible range.  

The  infrared  region  is  still  poorly  explored  with  the  ICLAS  method,  due  to  the  lack  of 
efficient  lasers  and  spectroscopic  instruments.  In  the  infrared  region  beyond  2.5  µm  only  one 
ICLAS experiment has been demonstrated to our knowledge.5 Using a KCl:Li Fa(II) color center 
laser, residual H2O and CO2 atmospheric lines were obtained in the 2.636-2.640 µm region, with 
a minimum detectable absorption coefficient equal to 3 10-7 cm-1.  

For  the  development  of  ICLAS  in  the  infrared,  the  Cr2+:ZnSe  and  the  other  Cr2+  - 
chalcogenide laser materials appear promising. They offer wide gain bands, centered in the mid-
IR  regions  between  2  and  3.5  µm.6 Additionally, they operate at room temperature and can be 
pumped with available solid-state, fiber, and diode lasers. Recently, first use of Cr2+:ZnSe laser 
for  ICLAS  was  performed  using  a  pulsed  Co:MgF2  pump  laser.7  The  recorded  spectra  of  the 
ambient atmosphere were oversaturated by the ambient water vapor. Furthermore, the 2.4 µm IR 
light had to be up-converted to enable detection by a grating spectrometer operating in the visible 
range, where linear CCD arrays are conveniently available.  

For analyzing the broadband laser emission spectrum, Fourier transform (FT) spectrometers 
appear as the most efficient instruments. They need only one single detector. Furthermore, time-
resolved  FT  (TRFT)  interferometers  are  available,  which  enable  the  temporal  sampling  of  the 
laser transient spectral dynamics observed in the repetitive pulsed operation mode. This results in 
the  measurement  of  numerous  spectra  observed  at  different  generation  times  under  the  same 
experimental sample conditions. This allows precise determination of equivalent absorbing paths 
by verifying the consistency of time evolution of different spectral lines, enabling the accurate 
line intensity measurement by ICLAS. 

In this Letter, we report the first spectrum recorded at the extreme infrared limit ever reached 
by  ICLAS  with  Doppler-limited  resolution.  It  results  from  the  combination  of  a  broadband 
Cr2+ZnSe laser and a time-resolved FT interferometer8
. Thanks to the sensitivity provided by the 
intracavity  path  length  enhancement,  we  are  able  to  observe  for  the  first  time  in  laboratory 
conditions  weak  difference  bands  of  carbon  dioxide,  which  were  up  to  now  only  seen  in

planetary spectra.9

The  experimental  intracavity  set  up  is  schematically  shown  on  Fig.  1.  An  Er3+-fiber  laser 
pumped  Cr2+:  ZnSe  laser  is  used  as  a  strongly  multimode  ICLAS  source.  An  acousto-optic 
modulator (AOM) with 0.5 µs rise-time chops the pumping beam. The 8 mm long single-crystal 
diffusion-doped Cr2+: ZnSe Brewster cut sample10 absorbs about 85% of pump radiation at 1607 
nm. The crystal has a peak emission cross-section equal to 1.1 x 10-18 cm2 at 2450 nm. The gain 
spectrum  full-width  at  half-maximum  is  as  broad  as  860  nm.  The  X-fold  four-mirror  cavity 
configuration  is  optimized  to  avoid  the  possible  parasitic  étalon  effects.  The  standing  wave 
cavity  consists  of  two  highly  reflective  (HR)  concave  mirrors,  a  HR  plane  mirror  and  a  plane 
output  coupler  (OC).  In  the  2300-2700  nm  region,  the  HR  reflection  coefficients  are  99.8% 
whereas  the  OC  has  6%  transmission.  In  this  configuration,  the  threshold  pump  power  is  160 
mW. In the present experiments, we kept the pump parameter η, ie the ratio of the pump power 
to  its  threshold  value,  at  η=1.6,  and  the  pump  pulse  was  400  µs  long  at  2  kHz  repetition  rate. 
From the monitoring of the total laser intensity on an InSb detector, the pulse-to-pulse variability 
of the optimized laser was found to be negligible and was consequently not taken care of. The 
light  leaking  outside  the  laser  cavity  through  the  OC  is  sent  into  the  interferometer.  The  Cr2+: 
ZnSe  laser  is  able  to  operate  under  secondary  vacuum.  The  vacuum  chamber  windows  (not 
shown on the diagram) are made of BK7 on the optical pumping laser side and of CaF2 on the 
interferometer side. 

The  stepping-mode  time-resolved  interferometer  is  equipped  with  CaF2  beam-splitter  and 
two InSb detectors cooled with liquid nitrogen. In time-resolved approach, the operating mode is 
such that, at each fixed path difference value, a set of n time samples is recorded, while the path-
difference  is  held  constant.  This  time  sample  acquisition  is  repeated  identically  at  each  path-
difference step, up to the maximum value of the path-difference. All time samples are rearranged 
afterwards  to  constitute  a  series  of  n  independent  interferograms  each  of  them  reporting  the 
spectral state of the source at one of the given instant of the time sampling procedure. Finally the 
TRFT spectrum obtained in one experiment is made of n time-component spectra, each of them 
exhibiting all the usual advantages of Fourier transform spectrometry. When applied to ICLAS, 
TRFT spectroscopy brings the following advantages. The intracavity gas sample is observed for 
all  time-components,  under  identical  pressure  and  temperature  conditions,  which  are  easily 
measured due to the small size of the cell. The only varying quantity is then the absorption length 
L.  Since  L  often  departs  4  from  the  ideal  law  L  =  c  x  tg  ,  errors  often  spoil  the  ICLAS  line 
intensity  measurements.  This  difficulty  is  overcome  with  TRFT  spectroscopy,  which  allows 
checking the consistency of L evolution and making a posteriori corrections with multispectrum 
fitting procedures.  

Two  series  of  spectra  were  recorded.  The  first  ones  were  obtained  with  the  laser  chamber 
evacuated  down  to  a  pressure  of  7  10-3  Pa.  The  laser  emission  is  centered  at  2490  nm.  For 
intracavity  spectroscopy  purposes,  secondary-vacuum  evacuation  of  the  laser  chamber  appears 
necessary. Under poorly evacuated chamber conditions, the parasitic absorption of the major air 
constituents  would  indeed  totally  obscure  the  range  of  interest  in  the  recorded  spectra,  as 
observed in Ref. [7]. Another advantage of the vacuum chamber is the possibility to insert the 
analyzed molecular sample in the laser cavity, with no need of an optical cell, the windows of 
which  would  narrow  the  laser  emission  bandwidth.  Also  the  filling  ratio  of  the  cavity  is  kept 
optimum  (close  to  unity),  and  additional  experimental  complexity  is  avoided.  The  following 
recorded molecular spectra were benefiting from these advantages.

The second series was made of several CO2 absorption TRFT spectra recorded under various 
pressures, from 396 to 7980 Pa and various resolutions, the highest being equal to 6.9 pm (11 10-
3  cm-1)  unapodized.  An  illustration  of  the  TRFT  spectrum  is  plotted  on  Figure  2  with  the 
resolution  reduced  to  62  pm  (0.1  cm-1)  for  clarity.  It  is  obtained  with  the  chamber  filled  with 
6650  Pa  of  CO2.  H2O  lines  are  also  present  as  impurities  in  the  spectrum.  At  each  given  path 
difference step, 64 time samples are taken from a given laser pulse with a 0.32 µs time-resolution 
and 256 pulses are averaged to improve the SNR. The data acquisition procedure results in a 64 
time-components spectrum. Each time-component made of 65536 spectral elements covers 452 
nm (737 cm-1). At small tg, the recorded laser spectral emission covers 125 nm (202 cm-1), filling 
only about one quarter of the available spectral range actually measured by the interferometer. 
This  emission  is  centered  on  the  much  broader  laser  gain  curve.  With  improved  experimental 
conditions aiming at reducing the broadband cavity losses, one can expect to slow down the laser 
dynamics and to increase by a factor of 2 the already broad explored spectral range. The spectral 
narrowing at longer tg reduces this spectral range by a factor of about 2.5 for the longest tg equal 
to about 27 µs (8.1 km equivalent absorbing path).  

The explored spectral domain is the location of the two weak vibration-rotation CO2 bands 
2ν3 - ν2 and 2ν3 + ν2 - 2ν2. A restricted portion corresponding to the R-branch of the 2ν3 – ν2 of 
two time components at tg respectively equal to 8.24 and 15.28 µs is shown with an expanded 
wavelength on Figure 3. The R-branch head at R(59) is seen on both traces. The two strongest 
lines on the upper trace belong to the ν3 band of residual H2O. Rovibrational transitions of the ν1 
band of H2O are also present. The different slopes of the background reveal the effect of spectral 
narrowing. The highest equivalent absorbing path reached in the CO2 experiment is equal to 8.1 
km.  With a SNR ratio of about 40 the corresponding minimum detectable absorption coefficient 
is 3.1 10-8 cm-1. Data recording time is 5 hours. Thanks to Fourier transform spectroscopy, a total 
of  about  4,200,000  spectral  elements  are  measured,  among  which  1,050,000  cover  the  laser 
emission  range.  Consequently  the  minimum  detectable  absorption  coefficient  at  1-second  time 
averaging is 4 10-9 cm-1 Hz-1/2. The most intense H2O observed line is located at 2536.3637 nm 
(3942.652  cm-1).  Its  intensity  is11  1.662  10-20  cm.molecule-1.  The  3  x  10-8  cm-1  minimum 
detectable absorption coefficient then corresponds to 0.9 ppbv water vapor detection limit. 

In  conclusion,  we  demonstrate  an  ICLAS  experiment  covering  more  than  100  nm  spectral 
range in the 2.5-µm region with Doppler-limited resolution and 3 x 10-8 cm-1 minimum detected 
absorption, using the time-resolved Fourier spectroscopy technique. Further experiments aiming 
at  increasing  both  the  sensitivity  and  the  simultaneously  explored  spectral  range  are  being 
actively pursued.

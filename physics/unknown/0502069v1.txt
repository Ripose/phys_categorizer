Abstract  The  energy  gradient  theory  is  used  to  study  the  instability  of  Taylor-Couette  flow 
between  concentric  rotating  cylinders.  In  our  previous  studies,  the  energy  gradient  theory  was 
demonstrated to be applicable for wall bounded parallel flows. It was found that the critical value 
of  the  energy  gradient  parameter  K  at  subcritical  transition  is  about  370-389  for  wall  bounded 
parallel flows (which include plane Poiseuille flow, pipe Poiseuille flow and plane Couette flow) 
below which no turbulence occurs. In this paper, the detailed derivation for the calculation of the 
energy  gradient  parameter  in  the  flow  between  concentric  rotating  cylinders  is  provided.  The 
theoretical  results  for  the  critical  condition  of  primary  instability  obtained  are  in  very  good 
agreement with the experiments found in literature. The mechanism of spiral vortices generation 
for  counter-rotating  of  two  cylinders  is  also  explained  using  the  energy  gradient  theory.  The 
energy  gradient  theory  can  also  serve  to  relate  the  condition  of  flow  transition  in  the  Taylor-
Couette flow to that in the plane Couette flow. The latter reasonably becomes the limiting case of 
the  former  when  the  radii  of  cylinders  tend  to  be  infinite.  It  is  our  contention  that  the  energy 
gradient theory is possibly universal for analysis of flow instability and turbulent transition, and 
which  is  valid  for  both  pressure  and  shear  driven  flows  in  both  parallel  and  rotating  flow 
configurations.

1. Introduction 
 
Taylor-Couette  flow  refers  to  the  problem  of  flow  between  two  concentric  rotating 
cylinders as  shown in Fig.1 [1-4]. This terminology was named  after the  works of G. I. Taylor 
(1923)  and  M.  Couette  (1890).  This  problem  was  first  investigated  experimentally  by  Couette 
(1890) and Mallock (1896). Couette observed that the torque needed to rotate the outer cylinder 
increased  linearly  with  the  rotation  speed  until  a  critical  rotation  speed,  after  which  the  torque 
increased  more rapidly. This change was due to a transition from stable to unstable flow at  the 
critical  rotation  speed.  Taylor  was  the  first  to  successfully  apply  the  linear  stability  theory  to  a 
specific problem, and succeeded in obtaining excellent agreement of theory with experiments for 
the  flow  instability  between  two  concentric  rotating  cylinders  [5].  Taylor’s  groundbreaking 
research for this problem has been considered as a classical example of flow instability study [6-
8]. 
In  the  past  years,  the  problem  of  Taylor-Couette  flow  has  received  renewed  interests 
 
because  of  its  importance  in  flow  stability  and  particularly  amenable  to  rigorous  mathematical 
treatment/analysis  due  to  infinitesimal  disturbances  [1-3].  For  the  stability  of  an  inviscid  fluid 
moving in concentric layers, Lord Rayleigh [9] used the circulation variation versus the radius to 
explain the instability while von Karman [10] employed the relative roles of centrifugal force and 
pressure gradient to interpret the instability initiation. Their goal was to determine the condition 
for which a perturbation resulting from an adverse gradient of angular momentum can be unstable. 
In his classic paper, Taylor [5] presented a mathematical stability analysis for viscous flow and 
compared the results to laboratory observations. Taylor observed that, for small ratio of the gap 
width  to  the  cylinder  radii  and  for  a  given  rotating  speed  of  outer  cylinder,  when  the  rotating 
speed of the inner cylinder is low, the flow keeps to being laminar; when the rotating speed of the 
inner  cylinder  exceeds  a  critical  value,  instability  sets  in  and  rows  of  cellular  vortices  are 
developed. When the rotating speed is increased to an even higher value, the cell rows breakdown 
and  turbulence  pattern  is  produced.  He  proposed  a  parameter,  now  commonly  known  as  the

T =

Re

Taylor number, 
, to characterize this critical condition for instability. Here, Re is 
the Reynolds number based on the gap width (h) and the rotating speed of the inner cylinder, and 
R1 is the radius of the inner cylinder. The critical value of Taylor number for primary instability is 
1708 as obtained from linear analysis. This value agrees well with his experiments [1-3]. 
 
However,  the  problem  on  Taylor-Couette  flow  is  still  far  from  completely  resolved 
despite the extensive works [11-17]. For example, the limiting case of Taylor-Couette flow when 
the ratio of the gap width to the radii tends to zero should be in accord with the status of plane 
Couette  flow.  Thus,  the  criterion  for  instability  should  reflect  this  phenomenon.  There  are  two 
recent works trying to address this issue to some degree of success [18-19]. One may observe that 
Taylor’s criterion is not appropriate when this limiting case is studied because plane Couette flow 
is judged to be always stable due to Taylor number assuming a null value using Taylor’s criterion.  
This may be attributed to the fact that Taylor’s criterion only considered the effect of centrifugal 
force, and does not include the kinematic inertia force. Therefore, it is reckoned to be suitable for 
low  Re  number  flows  with  high  curvature.  For  rotating  flow  with  higher  Re  number  and  low 
curvature, it may transit to turbulence earlier and yet does not violate Taylor’s criterion.   
 
Recently, Dou [20] proposed a new energy gradient theory to analyze flow instability and 
turbulent  transition  problems.  In  this  theory,  the  critical  condition  for  flow  instability  and 
turbulent  transition  is  determined  by  the  ratio  (K)  of  the  energy  gradient  in  the  transverse 
direction to the energy loss in the streamwise direction for the given disturbance. For a given flow 
geometry and fluid properties, when the maximum of K in the flow field is larger than a critical 
value,  it  is  expected  that  instability  would  occur  for  some  initial  disturbances  provided  that  the 
disturbance energy is sufficiently large. For plane channel flow, Hagen-Poiseuille flow, and plane 
Couette flow, the findings based on the theory are consistent with the experimental observations; 
for  the  experimental  determined  critical  condition,  Kc=370-389  for  all  the  said  three  types  of

flows below which there is no turbulence occurrence. The theory also suggests the mechanism of 
instability associated with inflectional velocity profile for viscous flow, and is valid for pressure 
driven flow and shear driven parallel flows. It has been shown that the theory works well for the 
wall bounded parallel flows (plane Poiseuille flow, pipe Poiseuille flow, and plane Couette flow) 
[21,22].  
 
In  this  study,  we  apply  the  energy  gradient  theory  to  analyze  the  Taylor-Couette  flow 
between  concentric  rotating  cylinders,  and  demonstrate  that  the  mechanism  of  instability  in 
Taylor-Couette flow can be explained via the energy gradient concept. Through comparison with 
experiments, we show that the energy gradient parameter K as a stability criterion is sufficient to 
describe  and  characterize  the  flow  instability  in  Taylor-Couette  flow.  We  also  show  that  plane 
Couette flow is just the limiting case of the Taylor-Couette flow when the curvature of the walls 
tends  to  be  zero.  For  flow  between  concentric  rotating  cylinders,  the  flow  instability  may  be 
induced by the rotating of the inner cylinder or the outer cylinder. If it is induced by the former, 
Taylor  vortex  cell  pattern  will  be  formed  when  the  critical  condition  is  violated  as  in  the 
experiments; if it is induced by the latter, Taylor vortex cell pattern will not occur and the flow 
may directly transit to turbulence when the critical condition is reached like as in plane Couette 
flow [1-3, 6]. In this study, the critical condition for the former situation is only studied. 
 
2. Energy gradient theory 
 
Recently,  Dou  [20]  proposed  an  energy  gradient  theory  with  the  aim  to  clarify  the 
 
mechanism of transition from laminar to turbulence for wall bounded shear flows. Here, we give 
a short discussion for a better understanding of the work presented in this study. In the theory, the 
whole flow field is treated as an energy field. It is thought that the gradient of total energy in the 
transverse  direction  of  the  main  flow  and  the  viscous  friction  in  the  streamwise  direction 
dominate  the  instability  phenomena  and  hence  the  flow  transition  for  a  given  disturbance.  The 
energy  gradient  in  the  transverse  direction  has  the  potential  to  amplify  a  velocity  disturbance, 
while the viscous friction loss in the streamwise direction can resist and absorb this disturbance. 
The  transition  to  turbulence  depends  on  the  relative  magnitude  of  these  two  roles  of  energy 
gradient  amplification  and  viscous  friction  damping  to  the  initial  disturbance.  Based  on  such,  a 
new  dimensionless  parameter,  K  (the  ratio  of  the  energy  gradient  in  the  transverse  direction  to 
that in the streamwise direction), is defined to characterize the stability of the base flow,

 equals  to  the  energy  loss  of  unit  volume  fluid

 in  unit  length  along  the  streamline  due  to  the  viscous  friction.  In  other  word,  the 
mechanism  of  generation  of  streamwise  energy  gradient  is  resulted  by  the  energy  loss  due  to 
viscous  friction.  Therefore,  for  shear  driven  flows,  the  calculation  of  K  can  be  obtained  by  the 
ratio  of  the  energy  gradient  in  transverse  direction  and  the  energy  loss  in  unit  length  along  the

streamline, 

K

.  As  such,  the  parameter  K  in  Eq.(1)  is  a  field  variable.  Thus,  the 

/

/

distribution  of  K  in  the  flow  field  and  the  property of  disturbance  may  be  the perfect  means  to 
describe the disturbance amplification or decay in the flow. It is suggested that the flow instability 

 

3

can first occur at the position of  maxK
 which is construed to be the most “dangerous” position.  
Thus,  for  a  given  disturbance,  the  occurrence  of  instability  depends  on  the  magnitude  of  this 
dimensionless parameter K and the critical condition is determined by the maximum value of K in 
the flow. For a given flow geometry and fluid properties, when the  maximum of K in the flow 
cK , it is expected that instability can occur for certain initial 
field is larger than a critical value 
disturbance  [20].  Turbulence  transition  is  a  local  phenomenon  in  the  earlier  stage.  For  a  given 
flow,  K  is  proportional  to  the  global  Reynolds  number.  A  large  value  of  K  has  the  ability  to 
amplify  the  disturbance,  and  vice  versa.  The  analysis  has  suggested  that  the  transition  to 
turbulence  is  due  to  the  energy  gradient  and  the  disturbance  amplification,  rather  than  just  the 
linear  eigenvalue  instability  type  as  stated  in  [23,24];  this  also  follows  that    the  pipe  Poiseuille 
flow is linearly stable for all the Reynolds number. Both Grossmann [23] and Trefethen et al. [24] 
commented that the nature of the onset-of-turbulence mechanism in parallel shear flows must be 
different  from  an  eigenvalue  instability  of  linear  equations  of  small  disturbance.  In  fact,  finite 
disturbance  is  needed  for  the  turbulence  initiation  in  the  range  of  finite  Re  as  found  in 
experiments [25]. Dou [20] demonstrated that the criterion obtained has a consistent value at the 
subcritical condition of transition determined by the experimental data for plane Poiseuille flow, 
pipe Poiseuille flow as well as plane Couette flow (see Table 1). From this table it can be deduced 
cK  at about 385 for both 
that the turbulence transition takes place at a consistent critical value of 
the  plane  Poiseuille  flow  and  pipe  Poiseuille  flow,  and  about  370  for  plane  Couette  flow.  This 
cK ≈ 370-385. 
may suggest that the subcritical transition in parallel flows takes place at a value of 
The finding further suggests that the flow instability is likely resulted from the action of energy 
gradients,  and  not  due  strictly  to  the  eigenvalue  instability  of  linear  equations.  The  critical 
condition  for  flow  instability  as  determined  by  linear  stability  analysis  differs  largely  from  the 
experimental  data  for  all  the  three  different  types  of  flows,  as  shown  in  Table  1.  Using  energy 
gradient theory, it is also demonstrated that the viscous flow with an inflectional velocity profile 
is unstable for both two-dimensional flow and axisymmetrical [26].

averaged velocity,  0u  the velocity at the mid-plane of the channel, D the diameter of the pipe, h  
the half-width of the channel for plane Poiseuille flow (L=2h) and plane Couette flow. For Plane 
Poiseuille  flow  and  pipe  Poiseuille  flow,  the  Kmax  occurs  at  y/h=0.5774,  and  r/R=0.5774, 
respectively. For Plane Couette flow, the Kmax occurs at y/h=1.0. 
 
 
For  plane  Poiseuille  flow,  this  said  position  where  Kmax>  Kc  should  then  be  the  most 
dangerous  location  for  flow  breakdown,  which  has  been  confirmed  by  Nishioka  et  al’s 
experiment [27]. Nishioka et al's [27] experiments for plane Poiseuille flow showed details of the 
outline  and  process  of  the  flow  breakdown.  The  measured  instantaneous  velocity  distributions 
indicate that the first oscillation of the velocity occurs at y/h=0.50~0.62.

For  pipe  flow,  in  a  recent  study,  Wedin  and  Kerswell  [28]  showed  that  there  is  the 
 
presence  of  the  "shoulder"  in  the  velocity  profile  at  about  r/R=0.6  from  their  solution  of  the 
traveling waves. They suggested that this corresponds to where the fast streaks of traveling waves 
reach  from  the  wall.  It  can  be  construed  that  this  kind  of  velocity  profile  as  obtained  by 
simulation is similar to that of Nishioka et al's experiments for channel flows [27]. The location 
of the "shoulder" is about same as that for  maxK
. According to the present theory, this "shoulder" 
may  then  be  intricately  related  to  the  distribution  of  energy  gradient.  The  solution  of  traveling 
waves has been confirmed by experiments recently [29].

As discussed in [22], the development of the disturbance in the flow is subjected to the 
 
mean flow condition and the boundary and initial conditions. The mean flow is characterized by 
energy gradient parameter K. Therefore, the flow stability depends on the distribution of K in the 
flow field and the initial disturbance provided to the flow. In the area of high value of K, the flow 
is more unstable than that in the region of low value of K. The first sign of instability should be 
associated with the maximum of K (Kmax) in the flow field for a given disturbance. In other words, 
the position of maximum of K is the most dangerous position. For given flow disturbance, there is 
a critical value of Kmax over which the flow becomes unstable. It is not trivial to directly predict 
this  critical  value  by  theory  as  in  parallel  flows  [20]  since  it  is  obviously  a  strongly  nonlinear 
process. Nevertheless, it can still be observed in experiments. The Kmax can be taken as a criterion 
for instability; if Kmax > Kc , the flow will become unstable.  
 
Thus, the study of distribution of K in the flow field can help to locate the region where 
the flow is inclined to be unstable. In Fig.2, K increases with increasing y/h for given h/R2 (at low 
value of h/R2), and its maximum occurs at the inner cylinder. Thus, the flow at the outer cylinder 
is most stable and the flow at the inner cylinder is most unstable.  Therefore, a small disturbance 
can  be  amplified  at  the  inner  cylinder  if  the  value  of  K  reaches  its  critical  value  for  the  given 
geometry. In other words, the location at the inner cylinder is a possible place for occurrence of 
instability occurrence first, as generally observed in the experiments [5,15]. 
 
In Fig.2, the line for h/R2=0 corresponds to plane Couette flow, which is a parabola [21]. 
It can be found that there is little difference in the distribution of K for h/R2=0.01 and h/R2=0. In 
terms of that view, one may expect that the critical conditions of instability for these two values 
of h/R2 are very near. When h/R2 increases, Kmax decreases. This does not, however, imply that 
the flow becomes more stable as h/R2 increasing. This is because that the critical value of Kmax  is

different  for  different  h/R2.  It  will  be  shown  by  experiments  in  later  sections  that  Kc  decreases

In  Equation  (27),  Kc  is  the  critical  value  of  Kmax  at  the  primary  instability  condition, 
which can be determined from experiments. For a given flow geometry, Kc is treated a constant 
for the initiation of instability as described before. It is found that the first term in the right hand 
side of Eq.(27) is that for Rayleigh’s inviscid criterion, and the second term in the right hand side 
of  Eq.(27)  is  due  to  the  effect  of  viscous  friction.  If  Kc  is  zero,  Eq.(27) degrades  to  Rayleigh’s 
equation.  The  theory  is  compared  with  available  experimental  data  in  literature  [5][11][12][15] 
concerning  the  primary  instability  condition  of  Taylor-Couette  flow.  Figures  3  to  4  show  the 
comparison of theory with Taylor’s experiments [5] for two parametric conditions, while Fig. 5, 
Fig.6  and  Fig.7  show  the  comparisons  of  theory  with  Coles’  experiments  [11],  Snyder’s 
experiments  [12],  and Andereck et al’s  experiments  [15], respectively. The critical value of the 
0
1 ≠ω  
energy gradient parameter K (Kc) is determined by the experimental data at 
(the outer cylinder is fixed, the inner cylinder is rotating). Using the determined value of Kc for a 
given  set  of  geometrical  parameters,  the  critical  value  of  νω /1
 is  calculated  for 
the  range  of  the  νω /2
criterion ( (

It can be seen from Fig.3-7 that when the cylinders rotate in same directions, the theory 
 
obtains very good concurrence with all the experimental data.  When cylinders rotate in opposite 
directions,  the  theory  obtains  good  agreement  with  the  experimental  data  for small  relative  gap 

 as  in  the  experiments  using  Eq.(27).  In  Figs.3-7,  Rayleigh’s  inviscid

width (h/R1).  For larger relative gap width, the theory has some deviations from the experimental 
data with increasing negative rotating speed of the outer cylinder. The reason can be explained as 
follows. When the gap is large and the cylinders are rotating in opposite directions, the flow in 
the gap is more distorted compared to plane Couette flow. This distortion of velocity profile has 
an effect on the flow energy loss and energy gradient. On the other hand, if the rotating speed of 
the  outer  cylinder  is  high,  the  flow  layer  near  the  outer  cylinder  may  earlier  transit  directly  to 
turbulence if the disturbance is sufficiently large [6][11], which has not been the focus of research 
before. This will obviously alter the velocity profile of the flow and influence the distribution of 
the energy gradient parameter K and the maximum of K (more discussion later).  For example, in 
Andereck  et  al’s  experiments  [15],  when  νω /2
 is  -100  and  the  inner  cylinder  is  at  rest,  the 
2Re  (
Reynolds  number  based  on  the  rotating  speed  of  the  outer  cylinder 
) 
reaches  416.  At  this  value  of  416,  the  plane  Couette  flow  has  already  become  turbulence 
(Rec=325--370).  For  opposite  rotation  of  two  cylinders  in  which  there  is  a  curvature  in  the 
streamlines,  the  transition  must  occur  earlier  than  that  in  plane  Couette  flow  because  of  the 
influence of the radial pressure gradient which increases the radial energy gradient near the outer 
cylinder. The same type of deviation in prediction is also observed in the comparison of Taylor’s 
mathematical  theory  with  his  experiments  when  cylinders  rotate  in  opposite  directions  at  large 
negative rotating speed of outer cylinder; in particular, if the relative gap is large [5]. Therefore, 
when cylinders rotate in opposite directions, more works are still needed to study the occurrence 
of turbulence as induced by shear flow near the outer cylinder (convective inertia resulted).   
 
In Fig.8, we show the distribution of K along the channel width at the critical condition of 
Kc=77 as shown in Fig.4. It can be seen in Fig.8a that K increases monotonically from the outer 
cylinder to the inner cylinder, when the inner cylinder is rotating while the outer cylinder is at rest. 
The maximum of K occurs at the inner cylinder, so the stability of the flow is dominated by the 
Kmax at the inner cylinder. In Fig.8b, it can be seen that K increases monotonically from the outer 
cylinder to the inner cylinder, when the two cylinders are rotating in same direction and  νω /1
 is 
larger than  νω /2
. The  maximum of K  also  occurs at the inner cylinder, so the stability of the 
flow is dominated by the Kmax at the inner cylinder too. In these two pictures, the base flow in the 
gap is laminar flow. Taylor vortex cell pattern are found in these cases as shown in experiments 
[5,15].  When the two cylinders rotate in opposite directions, the distribution of K generates two 
maximum respectively at the inner cylinder and the outer cylinder. In Fig.8c, it can be seen that 
the maximum at the outer cylinder is not high since the speed of the outer cylinder is small. In 
this  case  the  base  flow  in the  full  gap may  be  still  laminar,  and  the  stability of  the  flow  is still 
completely  dominated  by  the  Kmax  at  the  inner  cylinder.  If  the  speed  of  the  outer  cylinder 
becomes  high  and  exceeds  a  critical  value,  the  flow  near  the  outer  cylinder  may  become 
turbulence  provided  that  the  disturbance  is  sufficiently  large  [6][11].  As  shown  in  Fig.8d,  the 
value  of  K  at  the  outer  cylinder  (K=367)  is  about  or  higher  than  the  critical  value  for  plane 
Couette flow, the flow layer near the outer cylinder may be already in turbulence. Thus, the base 
flow  is  laminar  near  the  inner  cylinder  and  is  turbulent  near  the  outer  cylinder  at  the  critical 
condition  of  primary  instability  dominated  by  the  rotating  of  inner  cylinder.  Therefore,  Taylor 
vortex cell pattern could not be formed for such a case, but spiral vortices are generated. This is 
because that the generation of turbulence near the outer cylinder altered the velocity distribution 
from  its  laminar  behaviour.  The  circulation  of  fluid  particle  between  the  two  cylinder  surfaces 
(alternatively  laminar  and  turbulence)  forms  an  intermittent  and  spiral  pattern.  This  may  be  a 
good  explanation  for  the  reason  for  the  generation  of  spiral  pattern  as  found  in  experiments 
[15][11]. As reproduced in Fig.9, Andereck et al [15] plotted regimes of the flows in terms of Ro 
and Ri as coordinates (shown as Fig.1 in their paper). Here Ro and Ri are the Reynolds number 
based on the rotating speed of outer and inner cylinders, respectively. The behaviour of the flow 
may be better explained using the distribution of K along the gap width.

 versus  νω /2

In Figs.10 and 11, we show the isolines of the Kmax along the side of inner cylinder in the 
 
plane  of  νω /1
 which  occurs  at  the  surface  of  the  inner  cylinder.  Because  the 
energy gradient dominates the flow behaviour and controls the mechanism of the flow instability 
and transition, the classification of regimes may be better understood using the isolines shown in 
Figs.10-11. By comparing Figs.10-11 and Fig.9, the regimes of the flow from experiments may 
appear  to  be  aptly  characterized  by  the  isolines  of  Kmax  along  the  inner  cylinder  in  νω /1
 and 
νω /2
 plane.  It  should  be  noticed  that  the  isolines  for  Kmax<Kc  is  exact,  while  the  isolines  for 
Kmax>Kc  is  approximate  because  the  velocity  distribution  in  the  gap  can  not  be  accurately 
expressed by Eq.(4) anymore due to the formation of Taylor vortices or spiral vortices.  
 
It  would  be  (most)  interesting  to  obtain  a  unified  description  for  rotating  flows  and 
parallel flows vis-a-vis the mechanism of instability. As introduced before, although the critical 
value  of  Reynolds  number  differs  largely  in  the  magnitudes  for  plane  Couette  flow,  plane 
Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow, the critical value of the Kmax is about the same for all the 
three  mentioned  kinds  of  flows  (325-389).  Plane  Couette  flow  is  the  limiting  case  of  Taylor-
Couette  flow  when  the  curvature  of  walls  is  zero.  The  limiting  value  of  critical  condition  of 
Taylor-Couette flow should be the same as that for Plane Couette flow. For plane Couette flow, 
Lundbladh and Johansson’s direct numerical simulation produced a critical condition of Rec=375 
for  plane  Couette  flow  [31].  Other  three  research  groups  also  obtained  Rec=370 ± 10  in 
experiments  via  flow  visualization  technique  during  the  period  1992-1995  [32-34].  Some 
subsequent  experiments  showed  a  lower  critical  Reynolds  number  of    325  [35-36].  In  order  to 
include all possible results, the data can be classified as in the range of 325-370 for plane Couette 
flow.  Our  derivation  has  shown  that  Kmax=Re  for  plane  Couette  flow  as  indicated  by  Eq.(24). 
Using these data for Rec, the critical value of Kmax for plane Couette flow is taken to be  Kc =325-
370, below which no turbulence occurs regardless of the disturbance.

In  Table  2,  experimental  data  are  collated  for  the  critical  condition  of  the  primary 
instability in the Taylor-Couette flows. A most interesting result for small gap flow was obtained 
by Hinko  [17] recently. This result is useful to clarify how the Taylor-Coutte flow is related to 

 

12

plane  Couette  flow.  Hinko  obtained  Rec=350  for  the  flow  in  small  gap  of  concentric  rotating 
cylinders with h/R1=0.01. Under this critical condition, the Taylor number is T=3502Χ0.01=1225. 
This  value  is  quite  different  from  the  generally  acceptable  theoretical  value  of  1708.  For  this 
experiment, Kc=338 is obtained using Eq.(21). This value approaches the critical value for plane 
Couette flow of 325-370. All the experimental data for the primary instability in Taylor-Couette 
flows are depicted in Fig.12 by plotting Kc versus the relative gap width h/R1. The critical value 
Kc  of  Kmax  for  plane  Couette  flow,  plane  Poiseuille  flow  and  pipe  Poiseuille  flow  are  also 
included. It can be seen that there should be a good correlation of Kc for all said wall bounded 
shear  flows  including  parallel  flows  and  rotating  flows.  It  is  noted  that  Kc  decreases  with 
increasing  h/R1,  which  depends  on  Re  and  h/R1  as  also  shown  by  Eq.(21).  When  h/R1  tends  to 
zero, Kc gets very good agreement with the wall bounded parallel flows.  For all the wall bounded 
parallel flows, Kc=325—389, which are calculated from the experimental data [20][21].    
It  can  be  further  observed  from  Fig.12  that  Kc  decreases  with  the  reduced  h/R1.  When 
 
h/R1 tends to zero, the value of Kc tends to the value of plane Couette flow. Therefore, this may 
suggest  that  the  energy  gradient  parameter  K  is  a  very  reasonable  parameter  to  describe  the 
instability  in  Taylor-Couette  flow.  A  correlation  for  the  K  curve  for  all  types  of  wall  bounded 
parallel  flows  (including  Taylor-Couette  flows,  Plane  Couette  flow,  plane  Poiseuille  flow,  pipe 
Poiseuille flow) may be inferred from this picture. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that the 
critical  condition  from  experiments  for  Taylor-Couette  flow  corresponds  to  the  infinitesmall 
disturbance  (linear  instability),  while  those  for  parallel  flows  were  obtained  at  finite  amplitude 
disturbance. This problem needs to be further investigated. For Taylor-Couette flow, Snyder has 
given  a  semi-empirical  equation  for  the  collected  data  [12].  Esser  and  Grossmann  have  also 
given an analytical equation for the critical condition [37].

ω hR11≡

for  instability  is  Tc=1708  from  linear  stability  calculation  [1-2].  When  h/R1  tends  to  zero,  the 
flow reduces to plane Couette flow. In terms of the Taylor number, when h/R1 tends to zero (R1 
tends to infinite), T=0 and T<Tc; this means that the flow is always stable. In another word, by 
stating Tc=1708, the critical Re is infinite if h/R1 tends to zero. This contradicts the experimental 
results  of  plane  Couette  flow.  Obviously,  when  the  Taylor-Couette  flow  is  related  to  plane 
Couette flow, the Taylor number is not appropriate. It is only applicable for concentric rotating 
cylinders with the magnitude of h/R1 not very large or very small.  
 
Taylor [5] used mathematical theory and linear stability analysis and showed that linear 
stability theory agrees well with experiments. However, as is well known and discussed before, 
linear  stability  theory  may  not  be  applicable  for  wall  bounded  parallel  flows,  in  particular  for 
finite disturbance. As shown in this paper, the present theory is valid for all of these concerned 
flows.  Therefore,  it  is  postulated  that  the  energy  gradient  theory  is  at  the  very  least  a  more 
universal theory for flow instability and turbulent transition, and which is valid for both pressure 
and shear driven flows in both parallel flow and rotating flow configurations. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
In  this  paper,  the  energy  gradient  theory  is  applied  to  Taylor-Couette  flow  between 
concentric rotating cylinders. Derivation for the calculation of the energy gradient parameter K is 
given for Taylor-Couette flow, which is also related to plane Couette flow. The limit of infinite 
cylinder  radii  of  Taylor-Couette  flow  corresponds  to  the  plane  Couette  flow.  The  theoretical 
results  for  the  critical  condition  found have  very  good  concurrence  with  the  experiments  in  the 
literature.  The conclusions are: 

(1)  The  energy  gradient  theory  is  valid  for  rotating  flows.  The  critical  value  of  Kmax  is  a 

constant for a given geometry is confirmed by the experimental data. 

 

13

(2)  The  isolines  chart  on  the  plane  of    νω /1

 may  provide  a  basic  physical 
explanation  of  the  flow  regimes  of  vortices  found  in  the  experiments  of  Andereck  et 
al.[15] 

 versus    νω /2

(3)  All of wall bounded shear flows share the same mechanism for the instability initiation 
based  on  the  relative  dominance  between  energy  gradient  and  energy  loss  in  the  flow. 
The limit of Taylor-Couette flow becomes that of plane Couette flow. A correlation can 
be obtained for Kc versus h/R1 for all the wall bounded shear flows included in Fig.12. 
(4)  The K parameter is useful for relating plane Couette flow to Taylor-Couette flow. It has a 
clear  physical  concept  and  meaning.  On  the  other  hand,  Taylor  number  is  not  valid  or 
appropriate in the limiting case of Taylor-Couette flow when the radii of cylinders tend 
towards infinity.  

(5)  The  energy  gradient  theory  can  function  as  a  universal  theory  for  flow  instability  and 
turbulent transition and which is valid for both pressure and shear driven flows in both 
parallel flow and rotating flow configurations.

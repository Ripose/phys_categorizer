Abstract: We elucidate the properties of mixed-gap vector surface solitons 
supported by the interface between a uniform medium and an optical lattice 
imprinted  in  a  Kerr-type  nonlinear  media.  The  components  of  such  mixed-
gap solitons emerge from different gaps of lattice spectrum and their mutual 
trapping results in the formation of stable vector states. The unstable soliton 
component is stabilized by the cross-coupling with the stable component. We 
show  that  vector  mixed-gap  surface  solitons  exhibit  a  new  combination  of

Cross-coupling  between  several  light  waves  can  considerably  enrich  the  dynamics  of  their 
propagation.  Such  coupling  provides  a  strong  stabilizing  mechanism,  which  results  in  the 
formation  of  light  patterns  that  often  do  not  even  exist  in  scalar  settings.  Vector  solitons 
forming due to the coupling of two waves have been encountered in a number of geometries, 
including  uniform  media  with  both  coherent  [1-4]  and  incoherent  [5-8]  interactions.  On  the 
other hand, several previous investigations have shown that a transverse periodic modulation 
of  the  refractive  index  strongly  affects  the  properties  of  vector  solitons.  For  example,  two-
dimensional  optical  lattices  [9]  and  arrays  of  weakly  coupled  waveguides  support  strongly 
localized  vectorial  modes  that  have no  analogs  in uniform  media  [10-12].  Similarly,  mixed-
gap  vector  solitons  whose  components  emerge  from  different  gaps  of  the  Floquet-Bloch 
spectrum  of  the  periodic  structure  have  been  introduced  recently  [13,14].  Optical  lattices 
support a variety of other stable vector solitons [15]. 

The presence of interfaces between different materials substantially modifies the proper-
ties  of  both  scalar  and  vector  solitons.  It  was  shown  recently  that  the  interface  between  a 
waveguide  array  and  a  uniform  material  allows  formation  of  new  types  of  scalar  surface 
solitons  [16,17].  Prior  to  [17],  optical  surface  waves  were  also  observed  at  the  nonlinear 
interface  of  a  photorefractive  crystal  with  diffusion  nonlinearity  [18],  as  well  as  at  linear 
interfaces of periodic media [19]. Observation of highly nonlinear surface waves at interfaces 
of  natural  materials  is  a  challenge  due  to  the  large  powers  required  for  their  excitation  (see 
[20-23]  for  reviews).  Interfaces  of periodic  media  support  also  gap scalar  solitons  that  were 
predicted  theoretically  in  [24]  and  observed  experimentally  in  [25].  Gap  solitons  may  also 
exist at surfaces that are periodically modulated in the direction of light propagation [26]. 

Besides  scalar  solitons,  interfaces  of  periodic  structures  support  vector  surface  waves. 
The simplest vector surface solitons were studied in [27], for the case of coherently interacting 
components that emerge from a semi-infinite gap. Nevertheless, the most interesting situation 
is  encountered  when  the  components  of  the  vector  surface  soliton  originate  from  different 
gaps.  Several  examples  of  such  solitons  were  obtained  recently  at  the  interfaces  of  discrete 
binary  waveguide  arrays  with  focusing  nonlinearity  [28].  In  this  paper  we  study  mixed-gap 
vector  surface  waves  arising  at  the  interface  of  a  uniform  medium  and  an  optical  lattice 
imprinted in a Kerr nonlinear medium, for focusing and defocusing nonlinearities. We reveal 
that cross-coupling results in the formation of stable vector states, where instability of one of 
the components is suppressed by the interaction with the stable component. 

We  consider  the  propagation  of  two  mutually  incoherent  laser  beams  at  the  interface 
between  a  cubic  uniform  medium  and  a  periodic  optical  lattice.  For  concreteness,  here  we 
assume  that  the  strength  of  the  cross-phase-modulation  is  equal  to  that  of  the  self-phase-

 

 

modulation.  In  this  case  the  light  propagation  is  described  by  two  coupled  nonlinear 
Schrödinger equations for the dimensionless complex amplitudes q

Interfaces between uniform and periodic media can be fabricated technologically, e.g. by 
etching array of waveguides on a nonlinear substrate at  η
 [11,12]. Optical induction offers 
a  potentially  powerful  alternative.  In  this  case,  a  periodic  pattern  is  imprinted  in  a  photo-

whose maxima seat on the lattice channel nearest to the interface. The periodicity of the lattice

should fall into gaps of the Floquet-Bloch lattice spectrum (white regions in Fig. 1(a)). In the

. Stable propagation of the vector soliton depicted in Fig. 2(e) is shown in Figs. 4(c) 
and  4(d).  In  all  cases,  the  stable  vector  solitons  retain  their  input  structure  over  indefinitely 
long distances even in the presence of considerable input random perturbations. However, in 
both  cases,  increasing  the  weight  of  the  w  component  results  in  the  destabilization  of  the 
vector  soliton.  All  instabilities  encountered  for  vector  surface  solitons  are  oscillatory.  They 
result  in  progressively  increasing  oscillations  of  amplitudes  of  the  components  of  unstable 
soliton, emission of radiation into the lattice and decay into stable solitons. Here we present 
results  of  stability  analysis  for  only  one  lattice  depth,  but  we  verified  by  a  detailed  analysis 
that different lattice depths yield qualitatively similar results.

In summary, we reported a detailed analysis of the properties and stability of new vector 
solitons supported by the interface of a uniform medium and optical lattice. The components 
of such vector solitons emerge from different gaps of the Floquet-Bloch lattice spectrum, and 
exhibit  different  internal  structures  and  stability  properties.  Nevertheless,  we  revealed  that 
their cross-coupling leads to formation of new types of completely stable, mixed-gap surface 
vector solitons.

The formation of plasma channels with nonuniformity of about ± 3.5% has been 
demonstrated. The channels had a density of 1.2×1019 cm-3 with a radius of 15 µm and 
with length ≥ 2.5 mm. The channels were formed by 0.3 J, 100 ps laser pulses in a non-
flowing  gas,  contained  in  a  cylindrical  chamber.  The  laser  beam  passed  through  the 
chamber  along  its  axis  via  pinholes  in  the  chamber  walls.  A  plasma  channel  with  an 
electron density on the order of 1018 - 1019 cm-3 was formed in pure He, N2, Ar, and Xe. 
A  uniform  channel  forms  at  proper  time  delays  and  in  optimal  pressure  ranges,  which 
depend on the sort of gas. The influence of the interaction of the laser beam with the gas 
leaking  out  of  the  chamber  through  the  pinholes  was  found  insignificant.  However,  the 
formation of an  ablative  plasma  on the walls of the pinholes by the wings of the radial 
profile of the laser beam plays an important role in the plasma channel formation and its 
uniformity. A low current glow discharge initiated in the chamber slightly improves the 
uniformity  of  the  plasma  channel,  while  a  high  current  arc  discharge  leads  to  the 
formation of overdense plasma near the front pinhole and further refraction of the laser 
beam.  The  obtained  results  show  the  feasibility  of  creating  uniform  plasma  channels  in 
non-flowing gas targets.

Introduction 

Compression and amplification of laser pulses in plasma due to stimulated Raman 

backscattering (SRB) is now a proven method for the generation of ultrashort high power 
laser beams.1  With the chirped pulse amplification technique (CPA), power densities on 
the order of 1020 W/cm2 in the focused beam are available only with meter-size gratings. 

SRB  in  plasma  overcomes  the  material  limitations  of  CPA  and  allows  one  to  achieve 

power  densities  several  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  previously  possible  with 
moderate-scale  systems.2  Recently,  several  schemes  of  SRB  amplification  have  been 
proposed.2,3,4  While  some  schemes  predict  efficient  SRB  of  the  ionizing  laser  beam  on 
the ionization front in initially neutral gas,4 the majority of approaches are based on the 

interaction  between  counterpropagating  pump  and  seed  beams  in  a  pre-created  plasma 

channel. The resonant Raman backscattering scheme can be extrapolated to high powers 
conveniently using optical systems.5    

Being  essentially  a  resonant  three-wave  process,  SRB  amplification  is  rather 

sensitive to the plasma frequency ωp. Detuning of the resonance caused by longitudinal 

fluctuations  of  the  electron  density  δnez  is  due  to  corresponding  fluctuations  of  the 
electron  plasma  wave  frequency6  δωp  =  ωpδnez/2ne0.  Here  ωp  =  (4πe2ne0/me)1/2  is  the 

plasma frequency and ne0 is the electron density in the plasma channel. The frequency of 

the fluctuations should be less than the bandwidth of the pumping beam, which is about 
twice the SRB linear growth rate ∆ω ~ 2γ = a (ωωp)1/2. Thus, for linear amplification, the 

maximal allowable fluctuations of the plasma density is

where a0 = eE/mcω  is normalized electric field in the beam. For successful experimental 
conditions, the nonuniformity generally ought to be less than a few percent.7  

For  the  nonlinear  amplification  mode,  the  limitation  on  allowable  density 
fluctuations is modified. Solodov et al.6 showed that for given length L of uniform plasma 

channel the average fluctuation amplitude should be less than

where l|| is a longitudinal correlation length. For experimental beam parameters and l|| ≈ 
0.2 mm, the density nonuniformity has to be δnez/ne < 3-4 %.5 

In the first experimental arrangement, plasma with a density of ne ~ 1020 cm-3 and 
a  temperature  of  Te  ~  20  eV  was  created  in  a  capillary  by  KrF  laser.8,9  It  was  shown, 

however, that the effective length of the plasma channel in copper and LiF capillaries did 

not  exceed  0.2  mm,  presumably  due  to  intense  pump  absorption  via  an  inverse 

Bremsstrahlung  mechanism  and  initial  nonuniformity  of  the  plasma  density  in  the 

capillary. At lower plasma densities, amplification with K = exp(2γL/c) ~ 100 has been 
recently  demonstrated  with  Ar-filled  glass  capillary.10  However,  apparently  the 

significant density nonuniformity decreased the experimentally achieved amplification by 

several orders of magnitude when compared to the theoretical prediction.  

Alternatively,  high  density  gas  jets  ionized  by  Nd:YAG  laser  can  provide 
reproducible plasma channels of 1-2 mm length with a density of  ne ~ 1019 cm-3 and a 

temperature of Te ~ 5 eV. At this order of plasma density, pump absorption due to inverse 
Bremsstrahlung  becomes  less  important,  and  amplification  ratios  up  to  K  ~  103  were 
obtained.1,11 The possibility to measure directly the density profile in the jet plasma is an 

additional  advantage  of  the  method.  However,  turbulence  in  the  flow  from  a  nozzle 

effects the uniformity of the neutral gas density in the flow and, consequently, leads to 

plasma  density  nonuniformity.  At  present,  a  short  effective  length  L  is,  probably,  the 
main limitation of the RBS amplification.1 

Attempting to overcome the difficulties in creating a uniform plasma channel in 

flowing gas, the ionization of stationary, non-flowing gas can be considered. The creation 

of tubular plasma channels in stationary, non-flowing gas was first proposed by Durfee 
and Milchberg for guiding of high intensity laser beams.12 In a backfill gas at pressures of 

about 30-200 Torr, plasma channels with an electron density of 1 – 4 × 1018 cm-3 and a 

length of ~ 1.2 mm have been formed by Nd:YAG laser beam with a power density of ~ 

4 × 1014 W/cm2 focused by an aplanatic lens. Longer channels were shown to be possible 

to  create  with  the  use  of  axicon  for  linear focusing  of  the  ionizing laser  beam.  Initially 

formed with a radial density profile close to uniform, the channel forms a tubular plasma 

waveguide  due  to  shock  expansion,  which  is  rather  effective  for  guiding  high  intensity 
laser  beams  over  several  Rayleigh  lengths.13  Parameters  of  such  plasma  channels  were 

 

3

studied experimentally and numerically.14, 15 Gaul et al.16 reported the creation of 1.5 cm 

long channel in 400 Torr He backfill by axicon-focused Nd:YAG beam, using either long 

(~400 ps) 0.6 J pulses or 100 ps, 0.3 J pulses together with a pulsed arc discharge for pre-

ionization. 

While  ionization  of  stationary  gas  in  a  backfill  chamber  is  a  rather  promising 

technique  for  the  creation  of  elongated  uniform  plasma  channels,  it  is  of  little  use  for 

applications like SRB amplification. High power pump and seed beams, as well as ultra-

high power amplified beam, cannot be transported to the plasma channel in dense neutral 

gas  without  intense  interaction  with  the  gas.  For  such  applications,  the  gas  should  be 

localized  in  a  container  placed  in  an  evacuated  chamber.  The  container  should  have 

windows to let the interacting and ionizing beams to penetrate into the gas volume.  

In  this  paper,  we  demonstrate  the  possibility  to  create  plasma  channels  several 

millimeters  long,  with  acceptable  uniformity,  in  a  cylindrical  gas  container  having 

pinholes to let powerful laser beams directly to the plasma channel.  

 

Experimental setup 

Fig. 1 presents a sketch of the experimental setup. Taking technical details out of 

consideration, the gas target can be represented as a cylinder with a diameter of 10 mm 

and a length of 3 mm. The cylinder has two pinholes, P1 and P2 (see Fig. 1), on its end 

walls to let the laser beams go through the cylinder. The pinholes are made of copper and 

aligned with the cylinder axis.  The optimal diameter of the pinholes is determined by the 

balance between the minimal possible gas leak out of the cylinder and minimal losses of 

the  ionizing  beam  due  to  pinhole  closure.  Gas  is  supplied  into  the  cylinder  through  a 

needle valve V. The feeding gas pipe has a distributor made of porous metal to decrease 

possible density nonuniformities induced by the incoming gas flow. Gas pressure in the 

cylinder is monitored by a miniature pressure transducer. Optical access to the plasma is 

provided  trough  a  pair  of  optically  flat  windows  made  in  the  sidewalls  of  the  cylinder. 

The cylinder is placed in a vacuum chamber with a diameter of about 35 cm on a 5-

degrees-of-freedom kinematic stage. The background pressure in the chamber was kept at 

300-600 mTorr by a mechanical pump.  

An  Nd:YAG  laser  was  used  to  produce  an  ionizing  beam  (λ  =  1064  nm)  with 

energy in the range 0.1-0.7 J and a duration of τb = 100 ps. An initially rectangular beam 

of 5 × 1 cm was focused onto the gas target by a pair of cylindrical lenses L1. The beam 

size in the middle of the gas cylinder was ~ 70 × 70 µm full width at the half maximum 

(FWHM), which, for estimations, may be represented as a circular beam with a radius of 

rb ~ 85 µm. The Rayleigh length, therefore, can be estimated as ZR ~ 3.8 mm, which is 

about  of  the  length  of  the  gas  cylinder.  Thus,  we  may  assume  uniformity  of  power 

density of the ionizing beam along the channel. Alignment of the ionizing beam with the 

pinholes was monitored by a camera CCD2 though a telescope L2. 

The plasma density distribution in the channel was measured by an interferometer 

set  up  on  the  second  harmonic  (λ  =  532  nm)  probe  beam,  which  was  split  out  of  the 

ionizing beam. Interferograms were registered by a camera CCD1. The radial spread of 

the plasma was observed by adding a time delay to the probe beam. Phase shift profiles

retrieved  from  interferograms  were  then  processed  to  restore  the  radial  density 
distribution by an inverse Abel transform algorithm.17 

 

Experimental results and discussion 

General appearance 

A typical interferogram of the plasma channel, taken at a delay of τ = 800 ps from 

the arrival  of  the  beginning of the ionizing beam, is presented in Fig. 2. Channels with 

similar structures were observed in nitrogen in the pressure range of 20 – 300 Torr, in He 

at the pressures higher than ~ 200 Torr, and in Xe at 30-80 Torr. Channels are formed by 

laser  beams  with  energies  of  ~0.2  J  and  higher.  Similar  to  the  backfill  and  gas  jets,  an 
initial plasma spark is formed mainly due to tunneling ionization.18 Plasma electrons are 

heated  in  the  laser  field  due  to  collisional  absorption  of  laser  energy,  and  drive  further 

ionization  by  ion-electron  collisions.  Highly  nonequilibrium  plasma  expands  into  the 
neutral gas forming a shock wave and minimum of plasma density at the axis.10 

While  the  scenario  of  the  channel  formation  is  similar  to  backfill  and  gas  jets, 

several distinctive features have to be mentioned here. First, at the entrance (right side on 

the  interferogram),  plasma  channels  are  always  wider  and  shrink  gradually  along  the 

channel.  Second, a bell-like region of dense plasma is formed at the inner surface of the 

rear wall (left side on the interferogram). Both effects are induced by the presence of the 

solid  walls,  where  ablative  plasma  serves  as  seeding  source  of  hot  electrons,  and 

stimulates higher ionization. 

6

Pinhole size 

The parameters of the ablative plasma on the pinholes determine the limitations of 

the  pinhole  diameter.  Indeed,  the  ionizing  beam  has  to  penetrate  through  the  pinholes 

with minimal interaction, thereby presupposing a larger pinhole diameter. Expansion of 

hot ablative plasma with an overcritical density leads to closure of the pinhole aperture 

due  to  beam  refraction  and  reflection,  similar  to  the  closure  effect  in  spatial  filters. 

Minimization  of  pressure  disturbances  inside  the  gas  container,  oppositely,  requires 

smaller diameters. The optimal size should balance these opposite requirements. 

The  losses  on  the  pinholes  are  rather  significant  and  reach  ~  40-50  %  at  the 

incident energies of Jin ≈ 0.5 J. These losses are caused by closure of the pinhole aperture 

due to expansion of overcritical ablative plasma formed at the edges of the pinholes. In 

order  to  find  optimal  pinhole  sizes,  the  shock  velocity  should  be  estimated.  Such  an 

estimation  can  be  done  by  measuring  the  energy  transmission  through  the  pinhole  for 

different  incident  beam  energies Jin. The  measured values  are shown in Fig. 3a by dots 

for two pinhole diameters: 350 µm and 200 µm. Assuming Gaussian radial and temporal 

profiles  of  the  beam,  energy  transmission  through  the  pinholes  can  be  found  by 

integration  over  t  and  r,  taking  the  pinhole  radius  decreasing  in  time  with  the  shock 

velocity cT:

The calculated energy transmission is shown in Fig. 3a by the solid line, from which the 

shock velocities were estimated. The dependence of  cT vs. Jin is shown in Fig. 3b.  

Based  on  the  energy  transmission,  the  optimal  diameter  of  the  pinholes  was 

picked. For the actual range of beam power density, it corresponded to the diameter of  ~ 

350 µm for the front pinhole and ~150 µm for the rear one. At smaller diameters of the 

front pinhole, pinhole losses became too significant, which effects density and uniformity

Radial profile 

The expansion of the plasma channel in this experiment was found to be similar to 
the  expansion  in  backfill  experiments.10,11  Indeed,  the  parameters  of  the  ionizing  beam 
used in the present set of experiments are close to parameters reported by Clark et al.11 
and Durfee et al.,10 and non-flowing gas was also ionized. The expansion of the channel 

in time was studied thoroughly by these authors; thus, we mention here the rather close 

similarity  of  our  results  to  the  previously  reported  temporal  behavior.  Here,  the 

longitudinal  changes  in  the  radial  profiles  of  plasma  density  are  important.  A  typical 

example of the radial density profiles in 40 Torr of N2 is shown in Fig. 4a for the delay of 

~800 ps.  

Along  the  channel,  the  radial  profile  changes  due  to  spatially  dependent  energy 

deposition. The nonuniformity of the energy deposition may be roughly estimated from 
the thermal energy Eth of the expanding plasma. Clark et al.11 showed the applicability of 

the self-similar model of expansion of cylindrical shock wave for estimation of Eth from 
the position of the shock wave front: R(t) = ξ0(Eth/ρ0)1/4τ1/2. Here ξ0 ~ 1 and ρ0 is the gas 

density.  The  longitudinal  profile  of  Eth  for  different  gas  pressures  is  shown  in  Fig.  4b. 

Thermal energy is high near the front pinhole, where the influence of the wall plasma is 

high.  At  pressures  lower  or  about  110-120  Torr  N2,  the  energy  deposition  is  uniform 

between 0.7  and  2.5 mm and  stays within  2-5 mJ/cm depending on  pressure.  At  higher 

pressures,  however,  the  uniformity  disappears,  with  increased  deposition  near  the 

entrance  of  the  beam.  The  increased  energy  deposition  near  the  front  pinhole  at  higher 

neutral density might be explained by the increasing influence of the expanding ablative 

plasma.  Hot  electrons  from  the  ablative  plasma,  which  penetrate  into  the  neutral  gas, 

might result in the increase of absorption rate at the vicinity of the front pinhole.  

Supporting evidence for the hot electron effect comes from attempts to stimulate 

the  dense  plasma  formation  by  initiation  of  an  electric  discharge  in  the  gas  cylinder. 
While the addition of a low-current glow discharge with the plasma density of about 109 
cm-3 only improves by a little the uniformity of the channel, a high current arc discharge

leads  to  formation  of  a  dense,  highly  nonuniform  plasma  bubble  at  the  front  pinhole, 

resulting in its complete closure. 

The  radial  expansion  of  the  shockwave  with  formation  of  the  minimum  plasma 

density at the axis was observed in nitrogen, helium, and argon. In xenon, however, the 

radial  profiles  of  the  plasma  density  differ  from  those  lighter  gases  (see  Fig.  5).  Even 

after  about  1  ns  from  the  ionizing  laser  pulse,  the  profile  keeps  a  Gaussian-like  shape. 

The  density  of  the  channels  in  Xe  is  about  the  same  as  for  other  gases,  but  at  lower 

neutral  densities.  Channels  in  Xe  are  usually  nonuniform  and  shorter  than  the  cylinder 

length. This may be explained by the lower ionization potentials and higher mass of Xe 

atoms (which affects the expansion and ionization), and by the influence of the ablative 

plasma from the front pinhole.  

Differences between gases are illustrated also by the transmission of an ionizing 

beam  energy  through  the  gas  cylinder.  For  high-Z  gases,  energy  transmission  falls  to 

about 10% at about 80-100 Torr and remains at the same level at higher pressures for all 

gases (see Fig. 6). In helium, however, minimal transmissions of 31-33 % were observed 

at the pressures higher than 300 Torr. The pressure at which the energy transmission

reaches  its  minimal  value  coincides  well  with  the  maximal  pressure  at  which  plasma 

channels  with  acceptable  uniformity  may  be  created.  At  higher  pressures,  the  plasma 

becomes  denser  near  the  front  pinhole,  and  the  thermal  energy  Eth  becomes  low  and 

decreases significantly along the channel. 

 

Longitudinal profile 

The  uniformity  of  the  plasma  channel  is  optimized  at  the  axis  at  a  certain  time 

from  the  channel  formation.  Indeed,  the  higher  the  initial  density,  the  higher  the 

expansion rate and the consequent density drop at the axis. Thus, at some point in time, 

the initially nonuniform channel will have uniform density along its axis. This effect is 

particularly prominent for nonuniformities induced by the presence of ablative plasma at 

the entrance and the exit of the gas cylinder. For instance, we found that in nitrogen the 

axial part of the channel has good uniformity at about 800 ps from the ionizing pulse. The 

corresponding longitudinal density profiles are presented in Fig. 7. At  P =  40 Torr,  the 

channel had an average density of 7×1018 cm-3 with a nonuniformity of about  ± 7.5% and 

a radius of less than 15 µm. The best result was observed at P = 40 Torr, when a channel

15 µm. 

The  structure  of  the  plasma  channel  with  the  average  depth  of δner  ~  40%  (see 

Fig.  4a)  might  be  attractive,  for  instance,  for  SRB  schemes  with  strong  plasma  wave 
localization.19,20  It  was  shown  that  in  a  multimode  regime,  continuum  modes  of  the 
plasma channel might contract the backscattered beam and increase the growth rate.21 For 
our  parameters  of  the  channel  (density  at  the  axis ne0  ~  1.2  ×1019  cm-3  and  the  average 

depth of the channel ∆ne ~ 40%), the plasma density gradient exceeds the bandwidth of 
SRB:  η  =  (δner/  ne0)/(2γ/ωp0)  ~  20-50  for  beams  with  a  power  density  of  about  1014 
W/cm2. If η > 1, strong plasma wave localization occurs, and SRB amplification would 

benefit from contraction. Indeed, beams with λ = 0.88 nm and I ~ 5×1014 W/cm2 in the 

plasma channel will fall into appropriate conditions for the continuum mode contribution: 
U1  <  a0  <  U0.21  Here  U0  =    (δrne/  ne0)/2(ω/ωp0)1/2  ~  0.17,  U1  =  U0/(π1/2(2(ω/ωp0)3/4)  ~ 

0.01, and a0 = eE/mcω ~ 0.02.

Conclusion 

The  formation  of  plasma  channels  with  high  uniformity  has  been  demonstrated. 

The channels were formed by 100 ps Nd:YAG laser pulses with an energy of about 0.3 – 

0.5  J  in  a  non-flowing  gas,  contained  in  a  cylindrical  chamber.  The  laser  beam  passed 

through  the  chamber  along  its  axis  via  pinholes  in  the  chamber  walls.  The  plasma 
channel, with an electron density in order of 1018 - 1019 cm-3, was formed in pure He, N2, 

Ar,  and  Xe.  A  uniform  channel  forms  at  proper  time  delays  and  in  optimal  pressure 

ranges, which can depend on the gas molecular weight. While the influence of the laser 

beam interaction with the gas leaking through the pinholes was found to be insignificant, 

the ablative plasma on the walls of pinholes by the wings of radial beam profile is crucial 

in the propagation of the ionizing beams, and consequently in the channel formation and 

its  uniformity.  Low-current  glow  discharges  initiated  in  the  chamber  may  improve  the 

uniformity of the plasma channel.

Abstract 
 

A  quite  general  interaction  process  within  a  multi-component  system  is  analysed  by  the  extended  effective 
potential  method  liberated  from  usual  limitations  of perturbation theory or integrable model. The obtained causally 
complete solution of the many-body problem reveals the phenomenon of dynamic multivaluedness, or redundance, of 
emerging, incompatible system realisations and dynamic entanglement of system components within each realisation. 
The  ensuing  concept  of  dynamic  complexity  (and  related  intrinsic  chaoticity)  is  absolutely  universal  and  can  be 
applied  to  the  problem  of  consciousness  that  emerges  now  as  a  high enough, properly specified level of unreduced 
complexity  of  a  suitable  interaction process. This complexity level can be identified with the appearance of bound, 
permanently  localised  states  in  the  multivalued  brain  dynamics  from  strongly  chaotic  states  of  unconscious 
intelligence,  by  analogy  with  classical  behaviour  emergence  from  quantum  states  at  much  lower  levels  of  world 
dynamics.  We  show  that  the  main  properties  of  this  dynamically  emerging  consciousness  (and  intelligence,  at  the 
preceding  complexity  level)  correspond  to  empirically  derived  properties  and  criteria  of  their  natural  versions  and 
obtain  causally  substantiated  conclusions  about  their  artificial  realisation,  including  the  fundamentally  justified 
paradigm of genuine machine consciousness. This rigorously defined machine consciousness is different by its basic 
design  from  both  natural  consciousness  and  any  mechanistic,  dynamically  single-valued  imitation  of  the  latter.  We 
use  then  the  same,  truly  universal  concept  of  complexity  to  derive  equally  rigorous  conclusions  about  mental  and 
social implications of the machine consciousness paradigm, demonstrating its indispensable role in the next stage of 
progressive civilisation development.

1. Introduction 
 

Canonical  science  cannot  provide  a  truly  scientific,  i.e.  consistent,  fundamental  and  universal 
understanding  of  consciousness  considered  either  as  an  empirically  perceived  property  of  human  brain 
dynamics  or  a  general  property  of  intelligent  enough  system  of  any  origin  (see  e.g.  [1-12]  for  various 
existing approaches to consciousness and further references). Although the problem as such is not new and 
actually cannot be separated from the “eternal” man’s quest about his “ultimate” origin and destination, the 
last-time  development  of  technology,  society  and  civilisation  is  quickly  changing  its  status  from  vague 
“philosophical”  speculations  (always  remaining  with  us  and  inherent  to  the  problem)  to  much  more 
practically  oriented  and  even critically growing issue with increasingly important consequences at various 
levels  of  human  activity,  from  quite  new  directions  of  technology development to the deepest changes in 
individual  and  social  life.  Despite  visible  stagnation  of  the  previous  paradigm  of  artificial  intelligence, 
largely  reduced  to  various  kind  of  generally  useful,  but  definitely  non-intelligent  “expert  systems”  (i.e. 
actually false intelligence), the currently emerging inquiry of artificial, or machine, consciousness [13,14], 
starts from another, much more constructive level of purposes and demands, involving qualitatively higher 
intensity of interaction between previously separated disciplines and explicitly present intention to transcend 
other  characteristic  barriers  of  scientific  tradition  in  the  direction  of  qualitatively  more  consistent  and 
rigorous  knowledge  (this  implies,  in  particular,  that  machine  consciousness  should  contain  at  least  some 
irreducible, specific properties of the true consciousness). Note that similar to “artificial” intelligence, the 
“machine”  consciousness  thesis  certainly  includes  as  its  integral,  starting  component  the  unreduced, 
provably complete and rigorous understanding of the corresponding natural properties of human brain that 
can  then  be  implemented  in  artificial  systems,  with  various  degree  of  similarity  to  the  natural  prototypes 
that should constitute itself an indispensable part (and validity criterion) of  the consistent enough theory of 
conscious intelligence. 
 
The  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  present  a  new,  universal  theory  of  consciousness  based  on  the 
recently  elaborated,  reality-based  concept  of  dynamic  complexity  [15-19]  and  satisfying  the  mentioned 
demands  of  modern  technology and social development. Therefore we shall not review the existing other 
approaches  to  consciousness  and  their  results  (see  e.g.  [1-14]  for  some  details  and  further references): it 
will be enough to note that the latter are reduced to a sufficiently detailed — and certainly indispensable — 
description  of  the  empirically  observed  aspects  and  features  of  consciousness  that  can  serve  now  as  an 
efficient basis for verification of validity of any proposed “genuine”, scientifically rigorous and integrated, 
understanding of consciousness. Those results will thus be present in our exposure, explicitly and implicitly, 
in the form of a unified system of correlations between theoretically derived properties and known practical 
manifestations of consciousness. 
 
Any  truly  fundamental,  “first-principle”  and  realistic  theory  of  consciousness  should  acknowledge 
the basic role of interaction between the elements of the carrier of consciousness (such as the brain) in its 
origin  and  properties.  However,  the  performed  extensive  study  of  various  over-simplified,  perturbative 
models  for  such  interaction  is  reduced  to  substitution  of  the  real  problem  solution,  showing  interaction 
development, for its arbitrarily assumed (i.e. “guessed” and postulated) result, which can not reveal a clear, 
scientifically exact origin of emergent, qualitatively specific properties of intelligence/consciousness, leaving 
an impression of “something else” being present in the phenomenon of consciousness, a greater “mystery” 
unifying all its diverse manifestations in a single whole [1,7-11]. We start our analysis by showing that such 
contradictory situation is due to the fundamentally restricted, always perturbative description of interaction 
process  in  the  conventional  science  framework  and  that  if  one  avoids  those  usual  limitations,  then  many 
qualitatively new properties do emerge simply from the unreduced solution of the (many-body) interaction 
problem,  with  direct  relevance  to  both  consistent,  universal  concept  of  dynamic  complexity  and  the 
phenomenon of consciousness that appears, similar to a more general phenomenon of intelligence, as a high 
enough  level  of  the  unreduced  interaction  complexity  [15,16]  (i.e.  behaviour  of  a  system  with  a  large 

 

2 

 

 
enough  number  of  connected,  strongly  interacting  elements  with  the  necessary,  but  not  very  special, 
“generic”  properties).  It  means  that  we  provide  (section  2)  a  mathematically  exact  definition  of  the 
universal  dynamic  complexity  (as  well  as  closely  related  chaoticity),  expressed  in  terms  of  dynamic 
multivaluedness and entanglement of the unreduced problem solution [15-19], and therefore can proceed 
with equally rigorous definition of the properties of intelligence and consciousness, naturally (dynamically) 
emerging in a complicated enough system of interacting elements (section 3). 

We then consider various specific manifestations and “miraculous” parameters of conscious system 
operation  thus  obtained,  to  reveal  the  consistent  system  of  correlations  with  the  empirically  observed 
features of consciousness (section 3). Finally, using the same, universally applicable concept of complexity, 
we  rigorously  demonstrate  inevitability  of  machine  consciousness  introduction  in  complicated  enough 
technological  (and  social)  systems  of  the  modern  world,  analyse  possibilities  of  practical  realisation  of  a 
truly  conscious  behaviour  in  an  artificially  engineered  system,  and  outline  basic,  rigorously  substantiated 
conditions and consequences, both technical and social, of such conscious machinery incorporation into the 
real technology development (section 4). 

The  obtained  results  explicitly  demonstrate  also  the  possibilities and universality of the unreduced 
complexity concept, completing the results of its application at lower complexity levels [15,16,20-24] and 
thus  providing  an  important  additional  confirmation  of  its  unrestricted  consistency,  culminating  in  the 
universal  law  of  conservation,  or  symmetry,  of  complexity  [15,16,18].  We  show  that  the  unreduced 
complexity development at superior levels of intelligence and consciousness reproduces some key features 
and  stages  of  its  development  at  the  lowest,  quantum  and  classical  levels  of  complexity,  and  this  deeply 
rooted  analogy  can  be  quite  useful  for  consistent  understanding  and  efficient  use  of  both  lowest  and 
superior  levels  of  complex  world  dynamics  (without  falling  into the sin of fundamentally incorrect, direct 
mixture  between  the  two,  as  it  happens  too  often  within  the  fatally  reduced  framework  of  canonical, 
dynamically single-valued, or unitary, theory). 
 
 

2. Unreduced interaction process dynamics 
and the universal concept of dynamic complexity 
 

Any  system  showing  the  properties  of  intelligence  and  consciousness  can  only  be  based  on  the 
unrestricted, autonomous interaction process in a complicated enough network of elements, such as brain 
neurons or an artificial circuit. We shall now consider such unreduced many-body interaction problem with 
a  generic  configuration  and  demonstrate  that  its  truly  “exact”,  universally  nonperturbative  solution, 
liberated  from  artificial  limitations  of  usual  perturbative  models,  possesses  indeed some qualitatively new 
properties  that  show a unique system of correlations with the observed “miraculous” properties of living, 
intelligent,  and  conscious  systems,  which  can  not  be  reproduced  by  any  reduced  model  in  principle, 
irrespective of its technical sophistication (we shall reveal the exact fundamental reason for that). 
We take the real system configuration in the form of any number of well-specified elements (such 
 
as natural neurons or their artificial counterparts) with arbitrary, in principle, interaction between them, so 
that every element interacts with every other one by a known law. The detailed structure of interaction, or 
system  element  connections,  can  eventually  be  specified  for  each  particular  case,  but  we  formulate  our 
universally applicable description in terms of arbitrary interaction process (or “many-body problem”). Each 
element has its known internal dynamics, expressed e.g. by its “generalised Hamiltonian” (which is reduced 
eventually to a complexity measure, see below) and the corresponding “eigen-solutions”. Therefore, those 
separate (non-interacting) system elements usually represent themselves (quasi) integrable, “simple” enough 
systems,  but  we  do  not  impose  any  such  formal  limitation,  assuming  instead  that  the  separate  elements 
dynamics  are  known  in  the  form  of  explicit  solutions.  As  follows  from  empirical  data,  that  individual 
element  dynamics  is  typically  reduced  to  several  discrete,  stable  enough  states  of  an  element,  between 
which it can switch under the influence of external action (where these transitions between internal element 

 

3 

 
states can be accompanied by signals sent to the “outside”, i.e. to other elements, thus realising the global 
interaction  process).  The  problem  will  consist  then  in  description  and  understanding  of  evolution  of  the 
whole  system  of  interacting  elements  and  its  emerging  properties  and  structures,  in  their  unreduced, 
realistic  version  (i.e.  in  principle  without  any  “convenient”  approximation  of the conventional theory that 
can be convenient for the theory, but is always fatal for the real system dynamics, where it typically “kills”, 
as  we  shall  see,  just  the  most  interesting  features).  It  is  important  to  emphasize  here,  in  accord  with  the 
following  analysis,  that  all  the  specific,  “miraculous”  features  of  the  global  system  behaviour,  including 
intelligence and consciousness, originate just in the development of unreduced global interaction between 
elements,  rather  than  in  some  very  special,  “tricky”  properties  of  individual  elements  and  interactions 
(remaining in reality simple enough), as it is inevitably assumed in the conventional, perturbative theory. 
 
The whole, unreduced system dynamics is described by the existence equation for the system state 
function, Ψ, which actually generalises various model equations and can be derived in a self-consistent way 
as indeed a universal expression of arbitrary system dynamics [15-19] (see also below):

actually includes its time-dependent form (obtained by energy replacement by the time derivative operator 
and  considering  one  of  the  degrees  of freedom as the time variable). It is important also that the starting 
existing equation, eq. (1), serves merely as concise mathematical expression of the many-body problem and 
does  not  contain  any  simplifying  assumption  about  system  dynamics  or  configuration  (in  particular,  any 
formal, model “nonlinearity” of the starting equation is compatible with the following analysis). This means 
also that the elements of the (conscious) system “environment” can be included, if necessary, into the total 
system composition, described by eq. (1). 
 
It can often be useful to start from another, equivalent form of existence equation, where one of the

This existence equation describes, for example, the dynamics of our world emergence and behaviour at its 
most fundamental, “quantum” levels, in the process of attraction of two initially homogeneous “protofields” 
of  different  (“gravitational”  and  “electromagnetic”)  physical  nature,  described  by  the  generalised 
Hamiltonians 
eh q , respectively [15,16,20-24]. However, if we imagine that those distributed 
interacting entities have their internal structure (local inhomogeneities), then the system configuration may 
be  not  really  different  from  the  above “explicitly many-body” problem, which explains the coincidence of 
the transformed formulation of both problems in terms of the element degrees of freedom, eqs. (5) and (9).  
The  unreduced  brain  dynamics  can  also  be  considered  as  a  result  of  interaction  between  the  distributed 
electromagnetic and chemical components, though provided with the developed super-structure within the 
neuron  network  [15,16].  This  analogy  between  the  lowest  and  highest  levels  of  world  dynamics  has  not 
only formal, but profound physical meaning, and we shall continue to reveal its manifestations below. 
nψ ξ  from eqs. (9b) with the help of the standard Green function technique [25,26] 
 
and inserting the result into eq. (9a), we reformulate the problem in terms of effective existence equation 
formally involving only “common” (“structural”) degrees of freedom (ξ):

Reformulation  of  the  initial  problem,  eqs.  (1)-(10),  in  the  “effective”  form  of  eqs.  (11)-(15)  is 
known in scattering theory and related solid-state theory applications as the method of optical, or effective, 
potential (see e.g. [25]). The main “difficulty” of the nonintegrable problem is not really resolved in it, but 
rather displaced from the state-function equation as such to the potential in a simpler, externally integrable 
equation:  the  effective,  or  “optical”  potential  it  contains  depends  on  the  unknown  problem  solutions  and 
therefore bares all the problem intricacy. The “effective” problem formulation, being formally equivalent to 
the original one, has the advantage of much more detailed, explicitly expressed dynamical content (cf. e.g. 
eqs.  (9)  and  (11)-(15))  revealing  if  not  the  desired  solution,  then  at  least  its  main dynamical components 
and  their  recurrent,  interaction-driven  entanglement.  However,  the  conventional  theory  proceeds  by  very 
poor  use  of  these  advantages  and  prefers,  according  to  its  dominating  paradigm,  to  cut  severely  the 
“nonintegrable” EP expressions in order to end up with a “closed”, analytically finite, or “exact”, solution 
within  a  version  of  “perturbation  theory”  (e.g.  [25,27]).  In  such  a  theory  the  essential,  properly  dynamic 
content  of  the  interaction  process,  reflected  just  in  the  details  of  EP  expression,  eqs.  (12),  is thrown off, 

                                                
1 This rule corresponds to so-called “wave-like” (undulatory) levels of complex dynamics [15], where the main entities have a 
distributed  and  compressible  physical  structure  and  are  described  by  wave  equations  using,  in  general,  complex-number 
presentation.  Those  undulatory  levels  alternate  with  “particle-like”,  or  “classical”,  levels  of  complexity,  where  the  main 
entities  have  a  permanently  localised,  “hard”  structure  and  the  measured  quantities  like  “generalised  density”  are  derived 
)
from  the  state-function  amplitude  itself, 
  (it  obeys  now  classical  equations  for  real-valued,  directly 
measurable  distribution  function).  In  the  case  of  (truly)  intelligent  and  conscious  behaviour  one  deals  with  undulatory, 
“quantum” kind of behaviour at the main underlying levels of dynamics (see below for more details), and therefore one should 
use  rather  the  “wave-like”  relation  between  the  state-function  and  measured  “density”,  but  these  technical  details  do  not 
influence the main conclusions about the fundamental origin and structure of complex system dynamics.

and  the  system  configuration  is  obtained  as  a  rather  straightforward,  mechanistic  reproduction  of  the 
remaining,  reduced  potential  shape.  Correspondingly,  the  result  thus  obtained  cannot  contain  nontrivial 
dynamical  effects,  replaced  by  mere  geometric,  generally  small  “deformation”  of  the  initial  configuration 
and  the  simple  mechanical  sum,  rather  than  true  entanglement,  of  the  system  components  (this  reductive 
logic gives rise also to the popular concept of “geometrisation of physics”). And although all perturbative 
expansions appear to be mathematically incorrect for any real problem, while the studied systems do show 
dynamically involved, non-mechanistic and non-geometric features (up to intelligence and consciousness), 
the  reductive  approximation  of  perturbation  theory  dominates  in  scholar  science  approach  even  to  most 
complicated  systems,  probably  just  due  to  its  simplicity  and  despite  the  glaring  contradiction  to  the 
observed explicitly complex behaviour already in the simplest physical systems. 
 
To  fully  realise  the  EP  problem  formulation  and  obtain  its  unreduced  solution,  we  note  the  self-
consistent  nonlinear  dependence  of  the  EP equations, eqs. (11)-(12), on the eigen-solutions to be found, 
appearing dynamically, even for the formally linear initial dynamic equations (eqs. (1), (2), (5), (9), (10)). 
It  is not difficult to show [15,16,20,21] that this dynamic, essential nonlinearity of a problem, remaining 
hidden  in  any  its  ordinary,  straightforward  formulation,  gives  rise  to  a  qualitatively  new  phenomenon  of 
dynamic  multivaluedness,  i.e.  the  redundant  number  of  locally  complete  solutions  which,  being  equally 
real  and  mutually  incompatible,  are  forced,  by  the  main  system  interaction  itself,  to  permanently  replace 
each other in a causally random order thus defined. Indeed, if we designate by  Nξ and  QN  the numbers of 
terms  in  the  sums  over  i  and  n  in  eq.  (12b)  (equal  to  the  number  of  system  components  N  and  of  their 
internal  states,  respectively),  then  it  follows  that  the  total  number  of  the  problem  eigen-solutions, 
determined  by  the  maximum  eigenvalue  power  in  the  corresponding  characteristic  equation,  is 
(
,  which  gives  the  Nξ-fold  redundance  with  respect  to  the

“normal”  complete  set  of 
  eigen-solutions  for  the  initial  system  of  equations,  eqs.  (5),  (9),  and  an 
additional,  “incomplete”  set  of  Nξ  eigen-solutions.  Other  estimates  of  the  number  of  solutions,  using 
geometric,  model,  and  simple  “physical”  considerations  [15,24,26],  show  that  the  discovered  additional 
solutions are all equally real (not spurious) and have generally similar origin and structure. 
 
This  conclusion  is  confirmed  by  observation  of  the  ensuing  chaotic  change  of  states  in  various 
many-body  systems  and  interaction  processes,  without  a  really  consistent  explanation  for  it  within  the 
standard,  dynamically  single-valued  theory.2  Therefore,  based on the rigorously obtained multivaluedness 
of unreduced many-body problem solution, we can state that its general, now really complete solution, can

2 The dynamically single-valued, or unitary, models used, in particular, in scholar versions of the “science of complexity” try 
to  imitate  system  realisation  multitude  by  various  artificial  constructions,  such  as  “attractors”,  in  abstract,  mathematical 
“spaces”,  but  those  illusive  structures  are  always  “produced”  by  the  single available system state and trajectory, i.e. without 
any real change of system configuration in the real space. As a result, various imitative structures of the unitary “science of 
complexity”  represent  at  best  only  extremely  limited,  one-  or  zero-dimensional  (point-like)  projections  of  the  real,  dynamic 
multivaluedness  [15,16].  This  difference  between  the  unreduced  dynamic  multivaluedness  and  its  unitary  imitations  is 
especially important in such explicit complexity manifestations as intelligence and consciousness, whose very essence is given 
just by the detailed, fractally structured system configurations (see below) and their permanent change, rather than a smooth 
enough “trajectory” of a system with a fixed or “adiabatically” evolving configuration in the unitary theory.

Since  we  have  discovered  in  that  way  the  truly  dynamic  origin  of  (any)  randomness,  inevitably 
generated  in  a  real  interaction  process,  we  can  also  provide  the  related  purely  dynamic  definition  of

purely dynamic, and rigorously derived (rather than postulated) definition of probability, helplessly missing 
in the usual, empirically based, postulated probability notion (therefore the scholar statistical mechanics and 
related  branches  represent  but  a  “probabilistic”  aspect  of  the  same,  dynamically  single-valued,  unitary 
projection  of  reality).  Correspondingly,  the  emergence  and  disappearance,  or  change,  of  successive 
realisations  represents  the  rigorously  specified  and  universal  definition  of  event  (see  also  below),  another 
empirically  postulated  notion  widely  used  in  the  unitary  theory,  but  always  escaping  consistent 
specification.  The  qualitatively  new,  causally  complete  content  of  probability  thus  derived,  eqs.  (17),  is 
distinguished  by  the  fact  that  it  does  not  depend  on  the  number  of  actually  observed  events  or  even  any 
event observation at all: contrary to any conventional probability version, it remains valid even for a single 
(next) expected event or any their “statistically small” number. However, if the number of observed events

As can be seen from eqs. (19)-(20), the same resonant denominator structure that gives the unreduced EP 
multivaluedness,  eq.  (19),  explains  the  structure  of  each  realisation,  eq.  (20),  that  tends  to  concentrate 
iη  (it can be conveniently numbered as 
around a particular location, given by the corresponding eigenvalue 
rη ), due also to the “cutting” action of integrals in the numerator. The system in each particular realisation 
as  if  “digs”  a  dynamic  potential  pit  for  itself,  where  it  temporarily  falls,  until  the  well  and  related  system 
localisation disappear in favour of a transient delocalisation in a specific “intermediate” state, common for 
all “regular”, localised realisations and called also “main” realisation, before falling into the next “regular”, 
compact  realisation  with  another,  randomly  chosen  centre  of  localisation,  and  so  on.  This  unceasing 
realisation  change  and  related  qualitative  change  of  system  configuration  and  properties,  forming  the 
universal  basis  for  any  real,  dynamically  multivalued  structure  formation,  results  from  the  intrinsic, 
irreducible, and permanently present dynamic instability of a real interaction process revealed explicitly by 
the  unreduced  EP  formalism  in  the  form  of  nonlinear  feedback  interaction  loops  (self-consistent  EP 
dependence on the eigen-solutions to be found) and absent in any perturbative, “exact” solutions, obtained 
just by cutting those essential links (they also remain “hidden” in any straightforward problem formulation, 
such  as  eqs.  (1),  (2),  (5),  (9),  and  (10)).  The  important  relation  of  this  totally  “spontaneous”  structure 
emergence to the fundamental, dynamic origin of time is considered below.

.  Therefore  the  “main”  realisation  is  the  direct  analogue,  within  the  unreduced, 
V
; i
dynamically  multivalued  description,  of  the  single  realisation  remaining  in  the  usual,  dynamically  single-
valued  theory,  where  it  realises  the  averaged,  “statistical”  projection  of  the  multivalued,  permanently 
changing  dynamics  to  the  limited,  zero-dimensional  space  of  a  unitary  “model”.  The  specific  role  of  the 
intermediate  realisation  in  the multivalued system dynamics, outlined above, corresponds to its properties 
of  the  generalised  wavefunction,  or  distribution  function,  with  the  causally  explained  chaotic  structure 
[15,16,20-23]. It takes the form of the ordinary quantum-mechanical wavefunction at the lowest, quantum 
levels of world complexity (now causally understood without any esoteric “mysteries”), but is defined also 
for any other complexity level, where it can be closer to the quantum wavefunction properties for “wave-
like” levels of complexity (e.g. brain dynamics, see below) or closer to the (extended) classical “distribution 
function” for the “particle-like” complexity levels (with permanently localised main interacting entities). 

The  described  structure  of  realisation  change  process  involves  also  the  phenomenon  of  dynamic 
entanglement  of  interacting  system  components,  which  is  inseparably  related  to  the  major  feature  of 
dynamic  multivaluedness  of  the  unreduced  system  dynamics  and  expressed  formally  by  the  dynamically 
involved  products  of  functions  of  ξ  and  Q  in  the  unreduced  state-function  expressions,  eqs.  (14),  (20). 
Dynamic  entanglement  specifies  the  abstract  property  of  “nonseparability”  of  the  unitary  theory:  any  real 
system  is  “nonseparable”  just  because  the  degrees  of  freedom  of  interacting  components  are  physically, 
dynamically  “entangled”  (“woven”)  with  each  other  into  a  permanently  changing  system  configuration. 
Therefore  the  whole  interaction  process  and  its  results  can  be  described  as  dynamically  multivalued 
entanglement of interacting entities, where component entanglement constitutes each “regular” realisation 
and  during  realisation  change  the  components  first  transiently  disentangle, forming the quasi-free state of 
“intermediate”  realisation (generalised wavefunction), and then entangle again in a new version of system 
configuration  (another  regular  realisation).  In  that  way  one  obtains  the  real,  physically  tangible  and 
permanently internally changing “tissue of reality”, constituting the “flesh” of any real system or structure, 
while  in  the  unitary  theory  the  latter  is  replaced  by  its  abstract,  illusive  and  “weightless”  envelope  of 
“separated variables”, constituting the essence of all imitative, “exact” solutions and “integrable” models. 

The entanglement and physical nonseparability of the real system structure have also the important 
dimension of dynamical, multivalued (probabilistic) fractal. Indeed, the unreduced problem solution, eqs. 
(11)-(17), contains explicitly only one level of system splitting into incompatible and permanently changing 
realisations, while it refers also to the unknown solutions of the “auxiliary” system of equations, eqs. (13).

In  principle,  after  having  revealed  the  major,  universally  nonperturbative  effect  in  the  form  of  dynamic 
multivaluedness, we have some “right” to use an approximate solution for this, auxiliary system and obtain

We  can  obviously  continue  this  process  further,  obtaining  each  time  ever  more  truncated  system  of 
auxiliary equations, until we remain with only one equation for a single mode, which is solved explicitly and 
ends the real process of dynamical fractal formation. 

It is important that at each level of fractal hierarchy we have the same phenomenon of dynamically 
multivalued  entanglement  generated  by  the  same  dynamically  nonlinear  feedback  mechanism  as  the  one 
revealed  above  for  the  main  level  of  splitting  and  described  now  by  the  unreduced  EP  formalism  of  eqs. 
(23)-(24). This means that, contrary to the conventional, dynamically single-valued fractals (including their 
artificially “stochastic” versions), each level of the unreduced fractal hierarchy contains permanent change 
of  realisations  in  a  dynamically  random  order  [15-17].  As  a  result,  such  real  fractal  is transformed into a 
permanently, coherently moving and adaptively developing, “living” arborescent structure representing the

really complete solution of the many-body problem in its full complexity. It can be expressed as a “multi-

The dynamic entanglement at each level of fractality endows the unreduced fractal with “flesh and 
blood”  specific  for  the  given  system  and  determining  the  perceived  detailed  “quality”,  or  texture,  of  the 
system structure. The latter is directly related to the problem nonseparability, acquiring now a transparent 
physical  meaning  (it  is  impossible  to  separate  fractally  entangled  components  forming  permanently 
changing,  unstable  realisations)  and  actually  underlying  the  real  system  existence  itself.3  The  unreduced 
dynamical  fractal  can  be  described  by  a  number  of  slightly  different  versions  of  the  same  EP  method 
(depending  on  the  chosen  “zero-th  approximation”,  etc.),  but  they  all  give  the  same  fundamental  result, 
describing  the  unreduced  system  behaviour  as  a  dynamically  probabilistic  hierarchy  of  permanently 
changing  and  internally  entangled  realisations.  It  is  clear  that  due  to  the  hierarchy  of  levels  of  dynamical 
splitting  the total number of system realisations is exponentially large (where already the argument of the 
exponential  function  will  be  a  large  number  for  any  real  multi-component  system),  which  determines  the 
huge  dynamic  efficiency  of  the  unreduced  dynamic  fractality  playing  the  key  role  in  various  applications, 
including intelligence dynamics (section 3). On the other hand, and this is another side of “living” structure 
efficiency,  the  probabilistic  dynamical  fractal  always  preserves  its  integrity  (wholeness)  and  forms  and 
changes as an intrinsically unified configuration of the whole interaction process. 

Since  the  existing  world  structures  at  any  scale  result  from  the  corresponding  interaction  process 
development, it is clear that the whole universe, or any its part, can be considered as a single, dynamically 
unified,  probabilistic  fractal  structure,  where  the  emerging  more  “solid”  (distinct)  branches  (at  a  certain 
level)  correspond  to  “interacting  objects”,  whereas  the  finely  structured  fractal  “foliage”  constitutes  the 
well-specified, material content of the “interaction (potential)” itself. So contrary to simplified symmetries 
of  the  conventional  fractals  (scale  invariance)  and  their  limited  number  of  prototype  real  objects,  the 
unreduced  dynamical  fractal  represents  the  exact  structure  and  dynamics  of  any  kind  of  object  and  can 
show approximate scale invariance, or any other particular kind of structure, only within a limited range of 
scales.  However,  the  whole  huge  diversity  of  possible  dynamic  regimes  can  now  be  classified  as  a 
combination of two limiting cases, designated as uniform, or global, chaos and (dynamically multivalued) 
self-organisation, or self-organised criticality (SOC). 
 
To demonstrate the origin of both regimes, we note that in the limit of small eigenvalue separation 
(frequency) for the chosen structure-dependent, or “external”, degrees of freedom (ξ) with respect to those 
η∆  
for the element-dependent (internal) degrees of freedom (Q), 
i
η∆   are  the  neighbouring  eigenvalue  separations  with  respect  to  changing  i  and  n  respectively,  and  
and 
ξω   and  Qω   are  the  corresponding  frequencies),  the  summation  over  i  in  the  general  EP  expression,  eq. 
(12b), can be performed independently in the numerator, giving a local and single-valued EP limit (in view 
of the completeness of the auxiliary equation solution set) [16]:

3 It shows, in particular, that all basically separable, “exact” solutions and dynamically single-valued models and concepts of 
the  unitary  science  can  never  describe  the  real  system  as  it  is,  in  its  essential,  major  quality,  providing  instead  just  a zero-
dimensional, point-like version of an external, “immaterial”, abstract system shape.

Similar  results  are  obtained  for  the  state-function,  starting  from  eqs.  (14)-(15)  [16].  This  is  the  limiting 
regime  of  self-organisation,  giving  a  distinct  and  “regular”  system  structure.  However,  it  always  remains 
only  an  approximation  to  reality,  and  the  unreduced  EP  deviations  from  the  limit  of  eqs.  (27),  however 
small  they  are,  have  a  qualitatively  strong  character:  the  real  EP  and  state-function  are  composed  from 
many  close  (similar)  enough  and  very  quickly  changing,  but  nevertheless  different,  realisations,  which 
means  that  any  real  self-organisation,  and  the  resulting “distinct” structure, has dynamically multivalued, 
internally  chaotic,  fractal  character  and  permanently (and randomly) fluctuate, in a large range of scales, 
around  the  observed  “average”  shape,  thus  comprising  and  extending  the  phenomenon  of  self-organised 
criticality (SOC), which otherwise suffers, in its standard version, from a conflict with intrinsic chaoticity 
and  separation  from  other  cases  of  “self-organisation”  [15-19].  The  internal  chaotic  realisation  change 
within  an  externally  “regular”  structure  constitutes,  despite  its  “hidden”  character,  the  true  basis  of  that 
structure  emergence  and  existence,  without  which  it  loses  any  realistic meaning (including e.g. its proper 
time  flow,  which  is  an  ever  persisting  difficulty  of  the  unitary  theory).  This  limiting  case  unifies  also  the 
extended  versions  of  all  other  unitary  imitations  of  dynamically  multivalued  SOC,  such  as  “control  of 
chaos”, “synchronisation”, “phase locking”, etc., remaining split and incomplete in their usual versions. 
The  opposite  limiting  case  of  uniform,  or  global,  chaos,  is  realised when the above characteristic 
 
system frequencies (or eigenvalue separations) are close to each other, 
, i.e. 
the  corresponding  degrees  of  freedom  fall  in  resonance.  In  that  case  the  individual  realisation  eigen-
solutions  are  so  entangled  among  them  that  there  is  no  possibility  to  separate  them,  even  approximately, 
and  the  permanent,  chaotic realisation change takes its explicit, externally visible form, where sufficiently 
different realisations change at a not too fast and not too slow rate close to the main system frequencies. 
One  obtains  thus  the  universally applicable criterion of global, explicit chaoticity that coincides with the 
condition of resonance between the main system motions [15,16,19]:

) provides the universal criterion of occurrence of (multivalued) SOC kind of dynamics,

Universality  of  the  criterion  of  eqs.  (28)  is  of  particular  interest  for  the  unreduced  science  of 
complexity,  since  it  provides  a  simple  and  unified  principle  of  classification  of  all  possible  kinds  of 
behaviour and dynamics of any system, constituting a confusing problem for the scholar theory. It implies 
also  that  system  behaviour  can  vary,  in  principle,  between  those  too  extreme  cases of “global regularity” 
and “global chaoticity” depending on the value of chaoticity parameter κ. These statements are confirmed 
by  independent  analysis  of the particular case of true quantum chaos (and its correct classical limit) [24], 
where the corresponding parameter of transition to global chaos, K, is directly related to κ, 
. The 
conceptual  and  technical  transparency  of  the  proposed  criterion  of  chaoticity  and  regularity  is  to  be 
compared with obscurity of its unitary imitations, containing incorrect statements and technical trickery. In 
that  way  the  genuine,  intrinsic  complexity  of  unreduced,  multivalued  dynamics  allows  for  universal 
simplicity  of  the  key  criteria  formulation  and  related  harmony  of  the  general  picture,  whereas  illusive 
simplicity  of  the  dynamically  single-valued,  perturbative  “models”  leads  inevitably  to  technical  and 
conceptual uncertainty, leaving no hope for universally applicable, realistic understanding. In particular, the 
above  two  limiting  regimes  of  unreduced  complex  dynamics,  as  well  as  their  universal  meaning  and

relation,  appear  to  be  indispensable  for  understanding  of  the  emerging  phenomena  of  intelligence  and 
consciousness and their internal dynamics (see sections 3, 4). 

As  for  the  rigorously  expressed  notion  and  quantity  of  dynamic  complexity  as  such,  it  can  be 
universally  defined,  in  terms  of  the  above unreduced interaction analysis, by any growing function of the 
total (or actually observed) number of system realisations, or related rate of their change, equal to zero for 
(actually unrealistic) case of only one realisation [15-19]:

where  C  is  a  quantitative  measure  of  complexity,  and 
f x   is  an  arbitrary  function  with  the  designated 
properties.  An  “integral”  measure  of  complexity  is  provided  by  the  popular  “logarithmic”  expression, 
=
C C
,  which  properly  reflects  the  hierarchical  structure  of  complexity,  but  acquires  its  true 
meaning and usefulness only in combination with the universally nonperturbative analysis of the underlying 
interaction process that specifies clearly the relevant system realisations. Various “differential” measures of 
complexity are provided by rates of unceasing realisation change (temporal or spatial), taking the form of 
familiar  quantities,  such  as  mass,  energy,  or  momentum,  but  now  provided  with  a  quite  new,  causally 
complete  and  universal  meaning  (see  below).  It  is  evident  from  the  above  picture  that  the  unreduced, 
dynamically multivalued complexity basis thus defined includes also the notion of chaoticity, although the 
actually observed, apparent degree of irregularity for a particular case may vary depending on the specific 
regime of complex dynamics (but the unreduced, internal chaoticity is always there and is proportional to 
the unreduced complexity, see also the generalised entropy definition below). 

Note that, according to the definition of eq. (29), the unreduced, “genuine” dynamic complexity of 
any  dynamically  single-valued  “model”  from  the  conventional  science  (including  all  its  versions  of  the 
“science  of  complexity”)  is  strictly  zero,  the  single  available  realisation  of  the  unitary  projection  being 
presented  by  an  “averaged”  structure  that  corresponds  to  the  “main”  realisation  (or  “generalised 
wavefunction”) of the unreduced picture. However, that zero-dimensional projection of the unitary theory 
does not need to be structureless, and various really observed or arbitrarily postulated, often purely abstract 
elements  of  that  point-like  structure  are  often  substituted  for  the  real  system  realisations,  existing  in  real 
space,  after  which  a  non-zero  (but  totally  false)  value  of  complexity  is  readily  obtained  by  formal 
application of the same expressions (e.g. the “logarithmic” complexity measure). In addition, the notion of 
complexity  is  arbitrarily  and  inevitably  confused,  within  the  unitary  framework,  with  various  “similar” 
notions, such as “information”, “entropy”, and “chaoticity” (see ref. [15,16] and below for more details). 

Inquiry into the detailed structure of complexity brings us to the dynamic origin of space and time 
hierarchy  revealed  by  the  above  unreduced  problem  solution.  Indeed,  the  totally  “spontaneous” 
(autonomous)  structure  emergence,  in  the  form  of  dynamic  system  “concentration”  around  each  of  its 
permanently  changing  realisations,  consistently  derived  by  the  unreduced  EP  formalism,  should  then  be 
considered  as  real,  physical  space  structure  emergence  at  the  corresponding  “level  of  complexity”.  The 
generalised “space point” of each complexity level is provided by the emerging realisation structure at the 
moment of its maximum dynamical squeeze (before system transition to the next realisation), given by eqs. 
rη  
r
(19)-(20),  with  the  centre  of  this  “point-structure” being designated by the corresponding eigenvalue, 
(see the discussion after eqs. (19), (20)). The characteristic size,  0r , of this real space element is given by 
the  eigenvalue  separation, 
  (it  is 
η∆   is  measured  in  the  same  units  as  the  corresponding  “wavelength”).  A  yet  more 
assumed  here  that 
important space dimension, the elementary distance (length element, or characteristic wavelength),  x λ∆ = , 
emerges dynamically in the form of eigenvalue separation with respect to “external” degrees of freedom (ξ) 
or  neighbouring  realisations: 
.  This  is  the  spatial  measure,  or  “size”,  of  a  single  system 
jump between its successive realisations. The dynamically emerging time element measures the “intensity”, 
actually  given  by  frequency,  ν,  of  realisation  change,  which  is  inversely  proportional  to  the  direct  time 
“distance” (or period), 
, between two successive events of realisation emergence specified by

the unreduced EP formalism, which can be independently estimated as

“material”  signal  propagation  in  the  structureless  system).  In  other  words,  the  time  element  provides  the 
dynamically emerging duration of system jump between two successive realisations. 

Note that the space structure thus derived is intrinsically discrete (eventually due to the wholeness 
of  unreduced  interaction  dynamics  [15,16]),  while  time  is  fundamentally  irreversible  (because  of  the 
dynamic  unpredictability  of  each  next  realisation)  and  unceasingly  flowing  (due  to  the  same  dynamic 
multivaluedness,  driven  by  the  main  interaction  process  itself  and  thus  unstoppable  if  only  the  system 
continues  its  existence  as  such).  Due  to  the  dynamically  fractal  structure  of  any  particular  system  and 
hierarchy  of  complexity  in  the  whole,  the  real  space  and  time  have  the  corresponding  hierarchic,  fractal 
structure,  with  the  proper  dynamical  links  between  successive  levels  (branches)  of  the  dynamical  fractal. 
The  lowest,  most  fundamental  level  of  space  and  time  is  provided  by  the  interaction  between  two 
primordial, initially homogeneous, and physically real protofields that gives rise to (dynamically emerging)

dynamically  related  among  them,  they  are  also  qualitatively  different  from  each  other  by their origin and 
role:  space  determines  the  tangible,  “material”  system  structure,  texture,  or specific “quality” (including 
the dynamically entangled structure of each regular realisation forming the space element), while time has 
an immaterial nature (contrary to its incorrect “mixture” with space in the unitary science framework)  and

It follows that space and time thus universally and dynamically defined by the unreduced interaction 
process  constitute  two  major,  universal  forms  of  complexity  that can take a variety of different shapes in 
particular systems and at various levels of complexity. Space and time are directly made by the successively 
emerging and changing realisations of any real system, and therefore one can say that these two basic forms 
of complexity and their dynamic relation determine everything in the existing world structure. By contrast, 
various  measures  of  complexity  introduced  above  (starting  from  eqs.  (29))  are  suitable  functions  of 
realisation  number  or  rate  of  change,  and  thus  of  space  and  time,  which  provides  the  fundamental, 
dynamically  specified  origin  of  the  very  notion  of  function,  usually  considered  only  in  its  abstract, 
mathematical  meaning.  Since  the  simplest  possible  combination  of  space  and  time,  independently 
proportional to both space and time, is given by action, we arrive at the extended interpretation of action 
as  a  universal,  integral  measure  of  unreduced  dynamic  complexity,  thus  incorporating  its  essentially 
nonlinear origin and entangled internal structure:

where p and  E−  are initially just coefficients relating the dynamically determined increments of space 
x∆  
.  The  analogy  to  the  well-known  relations  from  classical 
and  time 
mechanics (where our universal description should remain valid) immediately shows, however, that p and E 
can be identified with the system momentum and (total) energy, respectively, now in their universally and 
complex-dynamically extended versions of differential measures of complexity:

The discrete increment of action-complexity (equal to Planck’s constant with the negative sign, -h, 
 
at the lowest, quantum complexity level [15,16,20-23]) describes an elementary step of system complexity

This universal law of conservation, or symmetry, of complexity, determining evolution and existence of any 
system, from elementary particle to the universe and conscious brain, has a transparent physical meaning, 
where  action-complexity  describes  available  stock  of  “potential”,  latent  form  of  “initial”  interaction 
complexity (generalised, integral version of “potential energy”) that transforms, by system evolution during 
interaction  development,  into  the  explicit,  final  form  of  fully  developed  system  structure  and  dynamics, 
represented by complexity-entropy (generalised, integral version of “kinetic” and “heat” energy). Entropy, 
as a measure of chaoticity, can only grow because of the fundamental dynamic uncertainty at every single 
step revealed above, but this is possible only at the expense of the equally decreasing action-complexity that 
provides the universal “driving force” for the dynamic structure (entropy) creation. Because of such role of 
action-complexity,  it  is  also  called  dynamic  information  and  provides  thus  the  proper,  complex-dynamic 
extension  of  the  notion  of  information.  In  that  way,  the  universal  science  of  complexity  considerably

where  E  is  the  (constant)  energy  value.  Note  that  the  generalised  Schrödinger  formalism,  thus  causally 
derived  within  the  unreduced  interaction  process  analysis,  is especially useful in description of unreduced 
intelligence and consciousness dynamics (see section 3). 
 
Another  manifestation  of  the  direct  dynamical  link  between  the  common,  delocalised  state  of 
wavefunction  and  different  regular,  “localised”  system  realisations takes the form of “generalised Born’s 
probability  rule”  that  expresses  a  regular  realisation  probability,  dynamically  defined  according  to  eqs. 
(17),  through  the  wavefunction  value  for  the  corresponding  system  location  (configuration)  [15,16]. 
Similar to the above causal quantisation rule, the probability rule has a transparent physical meaning in the 
multivalued  dynamics  picture,  since  it  states  simply  that  the  probability  of  wavefunction  “reduction” 
(dynamical  squeeze) to a particular realisation is proportional to the wavefunction magnitude around that 
particular  realisation  (and  vice  versa).  In  view  of  the  permanent  probabilistic  transformation  between  the 
wavefunction  and  regular  realisation,  one  could  not  imagine  any  other  situation.  One  can  derive  the 
probability  rule  in  a  mathematically  rigorous  way  by  invoking  the state-function matching conditions that 
r
should be used for evaluation of the coefficients 
ic  in the general solution expression of eqs. (14)-(15) or 
(20) (see text after eqs. (15)). The state of wavefunction represents just that “dynamical border” of “quasi-
free”  system  configuration,  where  the  effective  interaction  is  transiently  “disabled”  and  the  system 

 

16 

 

 
“automatically” matches “itself to itself”, but in a different state, i.e. it follows a “dynamic reconstruction” 
procedure (always driven by the same, major interaction). Therefore matching the state-function of eq. (20) 
in its “wavefunctional” phase to the corresponding “reduced” phase of a regular realisation (averaged over 
the  internal  degrees  of  freedom,  unimportant  here),  we  can  see  that  the  r-th  realisation  probability, 
(
α α
=
α
r
ic   (properly  averaged  over  i)  and  squared 
modulus of the wavefunction

Note  that  in  this  form  the  probability  rule  is  directly  applicable  to  the  “wave-like”  levels  of  complexity 
(such as those of quantum behaviour and “subconscious” brain dynamics), whereas for levels with particle-
like  (“generalised  classical”)  dominating  behaviour  one  should  use  the  generalised  wavefunction,  or 
distribution function, itself instead of its squared modulus. 

The  universal  Hamilton-Jacobi  and  Schrödinger  equations,  dynamically  related  by  the  causal 
quantisation condition and generalised probability rule, constitute together the causally complete, universal 
Hamilton-Schrödinger  formalism,  eqs.  (34)-(37),  generalising  all  (correct)  dynamic  equations  for 
particular  systems  [15,16,18].  The  unrestricted  universality  of  our  description  is  indispensable  for 
understanding  of  brain  (intelligence)  dynamics,  since  the  latter  obviously  “reproduces”  and  thus 
encompasses any behaviour it can practically apprehend. Note that the explicitly “nonlinear” (in the usual 
(
),
nh x t
 
sense)  forms  of  the  generalised  Hamilton-Jacobi  and  Schrödinger  equations,  where  functions 
contain  various  (small)  powers  of  action  or  wave  function  to  be  found,  are often postulated in particular 
applications,  but  they  are  rather  approximations  to  the  “effective”  versions  of  the  initially  “linear” 
equations,  where  such  essential,  dynamic  nonlinearity  appears,  as  we  have  seen,  as  a  result  of  natural 
interaction  loop  development  (see  eqs.  (12)-(15),  (19)-(20)  and  the  related  discussion).  Indeed,  it  is 
important that the above generalised equations include implicitly their unreduced, dynamically multivalued 
analysis and solution within the generalised EP method, constituting an essential extension with respect to 
the  usual,  dynamically  single-valued  interpretation  and  solutions.  Now  we  shall  analyse  manifestations  of 
this  universally  defined  complex  behaviour  and  applications  of  the  above  description  at  the  level  of brain 
dynamics, including the emerging phenomena of intelligence and consciousness. 

 
 
3. Intelligence and consciousness as unreduced complexity levels 
emerging in large enough systems of interacting elements 
 

Note  once  again  that  universality  of  the  above  complexity  derivation  and  concept,  applicable  to 
both real world dynamics and its reflection in an “intelligent” system of interacting elements (“generalised 
neurons”), plays a quite special, indispensable role in the ensuing theory of intelligence and consciousness, 
since that exact enough (in principle, unlimited) reflection of real world structure and dynamics is just the 
main distinctive feature of intelligent system behaviour. The latter can now be formally classified with the 
help of “complexity correspondence principle” [15,16], following in its turn from the universal symmetry of 
complexity (section 2). This rule provides a rigorously specified expression of a rather evident fact that the 
full, unrestricted reproduction of a real (complex) behaviour pattern needs at least as much (or in practice 
even  slightly  more)  complexity  of  the  reproducing  system  dynamics.  Despite  its  apparent  simplicity,  this 
rule  has  nontrivial  practical  applications  and  immediately shows, for example, that all “directly quantum” 
theories of brain function, appearing so readily in recent years and trying to explain it by the dynamics of 
the  lowest,  quantum  levels  of  complexity  (e.g.  [10-12,29-39]),  are  fundamentally  deficient  and  therefore 
wrong, irrespective of the details, as well as any unitary, dynamically single-valued model of consciousness 
in  terms  of  any  system  or  level  of  world  dynamics  (such  as  many  recent  “physical”  models  of  brain 
operation  [39-46]).  Indeed,  in  all  those  cases  the  level  of  complexity  of  the  supposed  (unitary)  origin  of 
consciousness is far below that of not only conscious, but even any real, multivalued system dynamics. 

 

17 

 
 
Returning to the unreduced interaction process that is at the origin of emerging, universally defined 
complexity (section 2), we can now specify that interaction and its results for the case of natural or artificial 
brain  (neural  network)  dynamics.  We  define  here  the  generalised  brain  (intelligence)  system  as  a  system 
with  a  large  enough  number  of  effectively  rather  simple,  in  principle,  interacting  elements  (each  of  them 
should  typically  have  at  least  a  few  stable  enough  internal  states),  which  are massively connected among 
them  (details  are  to  be  specified  below),  thus  realising  their  strong  enough  interaction  that  embraces  the 
whole system. Our general “existence equation” for a system with unreduced interaction, eqs. (1) and (2), 
includes  this  case,  but  it  can  be  further  specified  for  the  brain  system  in  the  following  way  taking  into 
account explicit dependence on time (mainly due to interaction with the controlled environment):

where  the  time  variable  t  is  suitably  added  to  the  independent  variables  (
remains  practically  unchanged  (with  the  proper  definition  of  generalised  energies,  e.g.  in  eqs.  (3),  (6)), 
including the basic system of equations (5), (9). 

Note  that  eq.  (38)  generalises  various  model  equations  describing  neural  network  dynamics  (e.g. 
[47-49]),  but  due  to  its  unrestricted  universality  it  implies  actually  much  more  than  neuron  interaction 
through  their  direct,  mechanical  connection  to  each  other.  It  involves  the  most  fundamental,  and  quite 
indispensable, level of global electro-chemical interaction in natural brain neurons that should also have its 
analogue  in  any  efficient  system  of  true  artificial  intelligence  and  should  be  distinguished  from  the  mere 
electromagnetic  (e/m)  interaction  transmitted  through  connections  between  localised  neurons.  This  latter 
interaction always exists in the brain, but it is essentially assisted there by interaction transmission through 
the  biochemical  cell  connections  and  system-wide  interaction  between  the  two  connection  interfaces,  the 
e/m and chemical ones. Recalling the analogy between the driving interaction processes in the brain and at 
the  very  first,  quantum  level  of  complex-dynamical  structure  emergence  (see  eq.  (10)),  we  conclude  that 
the  unreduced  brain  dynamics  is  determined  by  the  global,  brain-wide,  but  highly  inhomogeneous 
interaction between the e/m and chemical (physically real) “manifolds” constituted by all neurons and their 
connections, which is further assisted by individual inter-neuron interactions through both e/m and chemical 
cell connections [15,16]. Emergence of elementary particles and their interactions at much lower, quantum 
complexity  levels  are  similarly  described  by  interaction  between  the  omnipresent  e/m  and  gravitational 
protofields  [15,16,20-23]  (with  the  evident  analogy  between  more  “inert”  behaviour  of  chemical  and 
gravitational  components  of  the  respective  systems),  but  at  that  case  the  initial  system  configuration  is 
totally homogeneous, contrary to the very rugged “landscape” of the initial brain configuration. 

It  is  this  general  analogy  between  the  driving  interaction  configurations,  as  well  as universality of 
the ensuing complex-dynamic structure formation (section 2), that explains a remarkable similarity between 
the resulting brain and quantum particle behaviour, but the causally complete origin of dynamic complexity 
and the related complexity correspondence principle (see above) also shows that the microscopic, quantum 
world  dynamics  and  brain  function  dynamics  definitely  belong  to  very  different  complexity  levels  (as 
opposed to numerous directly quantum brain models in the unitary theory [10-12,28-39]). The fact that the 
much  higher  level  of  brain  complexity  shows  striking  similarity  to  quantum  system  behaviour reflects the 
universal  holographic,  or  fractal,  property  of  the  hierarchy  of  world  complexity  [15],  where  any  well-
defined  system  part  tends  to  reproduce  approximately  the  dynamical  structure  of  the  whole,  but  with 
proportionally smaller “resolution” (i.e. smaller number of features, or realisations, which just determines 
system  complexity).  Since  the  usual,  dynamically  single-valued  theory  cannot  see  that  dynamically 
multivalued (probabilistic) fractal hierarchy of permanently changing system structure, it is obliged to evoke 
the  single  “acknowledged”,  but  mysterious  (unexplained)  and  formally  postulated  case  of  that  kind  of 
behaviour,  i.e.  that  of  a  quantum  system,  to  account  for  another  “miracle”  of  the  unreduced  dynamic 
complexity,  that  of  intelligent  and  conscious  brain  operation  (the  same  “quantum”  mystification  is  used 
intensely by the same unitary science to account for various “miracles of life” and similar manifestations of

genuine  dynamic  complexity  in  social  life,  see  e.g.  [39-42,45,50]).  But  all  the  miracles  of  the  unreduced 
complexity,  at  any  quantum  and  classical  (including  conscious)  levels  of  world  dynamics,  qualitatively 
different  among  them,  obtain  their  causally  complete,  i.e.  totally  realistic,  consistent,  and  intrinsically 
unified, explanation in terms of the real, dynamically multivalued and fractal, interaction dynamics [15-24]. 
As we have seen before (section 2), eqs. (1), (2), (10), (38) are general enough to account for the 
above  complicated  electro-chemical  combination  of  brain  interactions  (including  interaction  with  the 
environment),  and  in  particular,  being  expressed  in  terms  of  system  element  dynamics,  they  lead  to  the 
same, standard system of equations, eqs. (5) and (9). It would be convenient to consider that the separated 
degrees  of  freedom  ξ  account  for  the  more  rigid,  “chemical”  degrees  of  freedom,  including  the  initial 
system  structure  configuration  (i.e.  “mechanical”  and  related  biochemical  brain  structure  on  a  relevant 
 variables correspond to the “global” (inter-neuron) e/m patterns, 
{ }i
scale), while one/several of the 
Qξ ,  eqs.  (14)-(20),  (26) 
and  others  to  the  internal  neuron  excitations.  The  resulting  state-function 
,
(where  the  explicit time dependence is included in  Q variables), represents the entangled electro-chemical 
dynamical pattern of the brain activity, accounting for all its functions. The most complete general solution 
for the brain state-function is provided by the universal, causally probabilistic and multi-level sum of eq. 
(26) over the emerging fractal hierarchy of system realisations, each of them obtained by the unreduced EP 
formalism,  eqs.  (11)-(17),  (23)-(25)  (together  with  the  respective  values  of  dynamic  realisation 
probabilities). As the analysis of the detailed realisation structure, eqs. (19)-(20), shows (see also [15-24]), 
the  dynamically  chaotic  realisation  change  process  at  each  level  of  dynamic  fractality  and  in  the  whole 
probabilistic fractal of brain activity pattern occurs inevitably in the form of the generalised quantum beat 
(essentially nonlinear, catastrophic pulsation), consisting of unceasing cycles of system dynamic reduction 
(squeeze)  to  the  regular,  localised  realisation  configuration  it  currently  takes  and  the  following  opposite 
dynamic  extension  to  a  delocalised  state  of  the  generalised  wavefunction  (intermediate,  or  main, 
realisation), where the localised state (regular realisation) involves maximum dynamic entanglement of the 
interacting  degrees  of  freedom  (here  e/m  and  chemical  constituents)  and  the  delocalised  state  of 
wavefunction  is  obtained  by  the  opposite  disentanglement  process,  transiently  “liberating”  interaction 
components  that  perform  automatic  dynamical  “search”  of  the  next  regular  (localised)  realisation.  If  we 
take into account the dynamically fractal (multi-level and hierarchically unified) structure of the quantum 
beat  pulsation  and  the  generalised,  causally derived Born rule for realisation probabilities, eq. (37), then 
we obtain a rather complete and unified picture of complex brain dynamics in the form of those unceasing, 
essentially  nonlinear,  global,  and  fractally  structured  cycles  of  brain  activity  (as  measured  by  e/m  and 
chemical  component  density/flux).  Due  to  its  “omnipresent”  and  permanently  changing  structure  at  all 
scales,  the  generalised  quantum  beat  solution  explains  the  observed  “binding”,  “awareness”  aspects  of 
intelligence  and  consciousness,  while  the  fractally  structured,  detailed  distribution  of  realisation 
probabilities  on  every  scale  according  to  the  dynamic  Born  rule  provides  the  causal,  rigorously  derived 
basis  for  the  meaningful  brain  operation  and  unreduced,  “human”  sense  of  the  resulting  information 
processing  and  understanding.  In  other  words,  the  fractal  system  of  centres  of  dynamic  reduction  within 
every  global  cycle  of  quantum  beat  pulsation  is  “automatically”  (dynamically)  concentrated  around 
currently activated (functionally important) patterns of external (conscious and unconscious) “impressions”, 
their  processing,  emerging  “thoughts”  and  resulting  “ideas”.  As  those  patterns  change in accord with the 
“input  data”  or  internal  brain  dynamics,  the  fractal  structure  of  each  quantum  beat  cycle  automatically 
adjusts  its  probability  (and  thus  density)  distribution  to  system  configuration,  ensuring  the  intelligent 
response and conscious understanding (they are thus particular cases of the universal property of dynamic 
adaptability of the unreduced complex dynamics, absent in any its unitary imitation [15-17]). In addition, 
the  essentially  nonlinear  quantum  beat  of  electro-chemical  brain  activity,  as  well  as  its  internal  fractal 
ramifications,  gives  rise  to  the  emerging  internal  time  (see  section  2  around  eq.  (30))  forming  the 
physically real, universal basis for the necessary “sense of time” (internal clock) of an intelligent system and 
having nothing to do with the explicit time of eq. (38) that originates from external (input) changes. 

Although  the  global  quantum  beat  pulsation  (and  their  more  localised  manifestations)  can  be 
measured in the form of well-known oscillations of the brain e/m activity (see e.g. [1-9]), it is important to 

 

19 

 
emphasize  their  essential  and  deep  difference  from  any  linear  or  even  formally  (but  never  dynamically) 
“nonlinear”  oscillation  models  of  the  unitary  (dynamically  single-valued  and  perturbative)  theory.  Indeed, 
the  latter  will  not  possess  just  those  essential  properties  of  truly  autonomous  emergence,  flexible  fractal 
“binding”  of  the  whole  brain  activity,  and  dynamic  adaptability,  which  are  especially  important  for 
understanding  of  consciousness  (see below). Another essential distinction from existing theories concerns 
the already mentioned generalised, “indirectly” quantum character of brain dynamics that has only external, 
qualitative  resemblance  to  the  directly  quantum  dynamics  at  the  lowest  complexity  levels  and  does  not 
involve  any  microscopic  quantum  coherence  on  a  nanometre  scale  and  below  (though  the  real  similarity 
between these two very well separated levels of dynamics has a rigorous complex-dynamic basis outlined 
above).  Note  also  that  high  similarity  between  quantum  (microscopic)  and  mental  levels  of  complexity  is 
due to the similar, predominantly “wave-like” character of the key entities at both levels (whereas this case 
is  somewhat  more  different  from  “particle-like”  level  behaviour,  such  as  that  of  “Newtonian”  systems  of 
permanently  localised,  rigid  bodies).  These  results  provide  a  consistent  solution  to  persisting  disputes 
around various “quantum brain” (and even quantum gravitation) hypotheses [10-12,28-40]. 

Recalling the universal Schrödinger formalism for the generalised wavefunction, eqs. (36), we find 
now  that  the  wavefunction  (intermediate  realisation)  of  complex  electro-chemical  interaction  dynamics  in 
),tΨ χ ,  satisfies  the  wave  equation  of  the  same  kind, 
(
the  brain,  also  designated  as  the  brainfunction,

causal  quantization  condition  of  eq.  (35))  unceasing  dynamic  collapses  of  the  brainfunction  to  various

where χis the emerging regular realisation configuration, forming the new level of tangible space structure, 
or causally specified “mental space”, made of thoughts and other patterns. The detailed structure of  χ is 
,Qξ   (essentially  e/m  and  bio-
obtained  by  dynamic  entanglement  of  the  interacting  degrees  of  freedom 
chemical ones) according to the unreduced EP formalism, eqs. (11)-(15), (19), (20), (23)-(25). Similar to 
quantum-mechanical  postulates  (now  causally  explained  themselves),  the  measured  dynamic  probability, 
r tα , of a brain activity pattern (r-th realisation) emergence is determined by the squared modulus of the 
brainfunction for that particular pattern, eq. (40), obeying the generalised, dynamically discrete Schrödinger 
equation, eq. (39). Note that similar to the microscopic quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation for 
the brainfunction does not describe the quantum beat dynamics itself (i.e. system “quantum jumps” between 
regular  realisations),  but  only  the  distribution  of  the  probability  amplitude  for  the  emerging  localised 
patterns  (regular  realisations):  it  is  the  result,  rather  than  origin  or  development,  of  the  quantum  beat 
process.  Correspondingly,  the  time  dependence  in  eqs.  (39),  (40)  comes  essentially  from  external 
interactions (within the Hamiltonian operator), rather than intrinsic system time. 

The  Hamiltonian  configuration  expresses  the  pre-existing,  “hardware”  brain  structure  and  can  be 

approximated, in principle, by various model equations, unified within the series expansion of eq. (36b):

The discrete form of differential operators in eqs. (39), (41) reflects the dynamically discrete (or quantum) 
character of unreduced interaction dynamics resulting from its wholeness [15,16] and appearing as visible 
discreteness  of  observed  brain  activity  patterns.  This  kind  of  essentially  nonlinear  structure  of  unreduced 
brain dynamics, starting from the global quantum beat, may appear externally as a quasi-periodic pattern, 
but  it  is  quite  different  from  any  unitary  oscillation  by  its  origin  and  internal  dynamics.  Nevertheless,  at 
sufficiently fundamental levels of complexity or sometimes in the case of quasi-periodic behaviour (the limit 

 

20 

 

 
of multivalued SOC, see section 2) the discrete form of the dynamic equation for the brainfunction can be 
replaced  by  a  usual,  continuous  form  during  its  limited,  “external”  analysis.  There  is,  however,  another 
important  distinction  of  the  universal  Schrödinger  formalism  from  any  unitary  model  that  can  hardly  be 
neglected,  especially  for  the  brain  dynamics:  the  former  implies,  contrary  to  the  latter,  the  unreduced, 
dynamically  multivalued,  and  thus  truly  chaotic,  solution  (section  2)  that  provides  many  essential,  easily 
observable  properties  of  the  real  brain  operation  (we  discuss  them  below).  This  feature,  as  well  as  the 
whole  complex-dynamic  understanding  and  description  of  the  brain  dynamics,  highlights  the  dynamically 
emergent,  structure-forming,  holistic  character  of  any  brain  property  thus  derived,  as  opposed  to various 
unitary imitations that cannot describe explicit structure emergence in principle and are forced therefore to 
artificially insert any its property with the help of a postulated, mechanistically fixed structure or lower-
level property. Just as the “miracles” of true intelligence and consciousness cannot be reduced “globally” to 
the  postulated  miracles  of  standard  quantum  mechanics  (see  above),  their  essential  features  cannot  be 
consistently  explained  by  various  “local”  models of neuron operation, such as the well-known “integrate-
and-fire” model. Such models may only reflect particular details of individual neuron interaction acts, which 
can eventually constitute an important feature, but cannot directly account for the emerging result of many 
closely  related  individual  interactions,  permanently  (and  essentially)  changing  in  time.  Due  to  its  inherent 
universality, the above brainfunction formalism and causal interpretation refer, in principle, to any level or 
scale  of  fractal  brain dynamics, from the whole brain to any its level or activity pattern. In particular, the 
universal  interaction  complexity  development  (section  2)  will  appear  in  the  form  of  natural,  generally 
irregular alternation of patterns of both limiting cases of complex dynamics, the more permanent (distinct) 
structures of multivalued SOC and irregularly changing (smeared) patterns of uniform chaos. 
 
Having thus established the general dynamic content of neural networks with massively interacting 
components, we can now proceed with specification of dynamical meaning of the emerging properties of 
intelligence and consciousness. Already the obtained general picture of unreduced interaction development 
and  complexity  properties,  applied  now  to  the  neuron  interaction  processes,  show  that  intelligence  and 
consciousness  can  only  be  understood  as  big  and  high  enough  levels  of  unreduced  dynamic  complexity 
(where  the  level  of  consciousness  is  generally  higher  than  that  of  intelligence).  In  agreement  with  the 
general  probabilistically  fractal  structure  of  complexity  [15-17],  complexity  levels  of  neural  network 
dynamics  have  hierarchical,  fractal  structure,  where  big  enough  “branches”  (levels)  describe  qualitatively 
specific  types  of  behaviour,  separated  by  very  “steep”  and  big  enough  (but  still  physically  continuous) 
complexity  “jumps”  from  those  of  lower  (and  higher)  levels  of  unreduced  dynamic  complexity.  Since 
general (true) intelligence, including its unconscious, “animal” forms is characterised by efficient control of 
a  large  enough  environment,  its  (minimum)  complexity  level  can  be  defined  as  that  of  the  complete 
environment  complexity  (including  the  reverse  influence  upon  it  from  intelligent  species,  etc.).4  The 
necessary part of this condition follows from the complexity correspondence rule outlined above, while its 
sufficiency can be related to the “principle of parsimony” (Occam’s razor), which can, however, be causally 
derived  itself  as  another  aspect  of  the  same  complexity  correspondence  principle.  In  other  words,  the 
dynamic complexity of intelligent behaviour can come exclusively from interaction of the intelligent system 
with  the  “generalised”  environment  and  will  therefore,  in  its  sufficient  version,  only  slightly  (though 
definitely)  exceed  the  total  complexity  of  the  latter.  It  is  worthy  of  noting  that  contrary  to  lower-level 
dynamic  complexity  of  non-intelligent  systems  (including  living  organisms)  that  can  also  quite 
“successfully”  exist  in  the  same  environment,  a  truly  intelligent  system  will  concentrate  within  its 
individual, single “copy” the whole, distributed complexity of the dynamic environment. In accord with our 
universal complexity definition (section 2), this level of complexity where the true intelligence begins can be 
expressed quantitatively in terms of the corresponding number of permanently changing realisations of all 
interactions in the “generalised environment”. However, it is the qualitatively big level of complexity that is 

                                                
4  In  fact,  the  highest  complexity  of  any  well-established  (developed)  environment  is  determined  basically  by  its  intelligent 
components  (if  any),  which  interferes  self-consistently  with  intelligence  definition  as  environment  complexity  and  explains 
why the level of (minimum) intelligence depends relatively weakly on the details of nonintelligent environment dynamics. 

 

21 

 
much  more  important  than  the  particular  realisation  number  it  contains  (the  latter  can  vary  considerably 
during  internal  development  of  any  given  level  of  complexity),  which  explains  why  certain  “minimum” 
natural  intelligence  can  be  defined  rather  well  (although  it  inevitably  has  a  “fractal”,  partially  smeared 
structure),  despite  apparently  large  possible  variations  of various environment details. In this sense, if we 
define artificial (any) intelligence in a similar way with respect to any (artificial) environment complexity, it 
can  certainly  vary  in  a  much  larger  range,  including  systems  whose  “perfect”  intelligence  in  a  particular, 
restricted  environment  will  become  totally  useless  (“nonintelligent”)  in  another  environment  with  higher 
complexity (such situations can certainly happen occasionally also for natural intelligent systems). 
 
Being a direct and “minimum sufficient” reflection of the environment complexity, the nonconscious 
intelligence is inevitably characterised by the globally chaotic kind of dynamics, as opposed to the limit of 
multivalued  self-organisation  (section  2).  Therefore  such  minimum,  or  animal,  intelligence  is  qualitatively 
insufficient  for  appearance  of  the  main  properties of conscious behaviour.5 The next higher level of brain 
dynamic complexity able to provide the minimum true consciousness is naturally obtained then in the form 
of  simplest  permanently  localised,  SOC  type  of  structures,  which  can  be  realised  as  elementary  bound 
states of nonconscious (but typically intelligent) brain patterns. At this point a general analogy with similar 
complexity development at its lowest, quantum levels can be useful. Dynamic consciousness emergence in 
the form of bound states is analogous to complex-dynamic emergence of the level of permanently localised, 
classical states from purely quantum, delocalised and chaotic behaviour at the lowest complexity sublevels 
[15,16,20-22]. If two elementary particles, such as proton and electron, form an elementary bound system, 
such as atom, then the probability of their simultaneous quantum jumps in one direction is low and quickly 
decreases  with  the  number  of  jumps  (in  the  same  direction).  This  is  because  the  quantum  beat  jumps  of 
each of the bound particles are chaotic and independent from those of its partner. The bound quantum beat 
processes can therefore only perform their chaotic “dance” around each other, but cannot progress together 
to  a  big  distance  in  one  direction  (in  the  absence  of  external  force).  Now  the  same  mechanism  of 
“generalised  classicality”  emergence  in  a  bound  system  applies  also  to  emergence  of  localised,  conscious 
states  in  the  brain  in  the  form  of  bound  systems  of  various  strongly  chaotic,  delocalised  structures  of 
unconscious  levels  of  brain  complexity.  The  first  conscious  level  of  brain  activity  results  therefore  from 
further  (binding)  interaction  of  unconscious  activity  products  (“generalised  impressions”  from  the 
environment) leading to formation of various bound, permanently localised, or conscious, states (their life 
time should be at least much greater than the period of internal quantum beat of each bound component). 
These simplest “elements of consciousness” start then interacting among them to form new localised (SOC) 
or  globally  chaotic  states  of  higher  sublevels,  which  constitute  the  developing  structure  of  growing 
complexity of consciousness. Such additional interaction with respect to unconscious intelligence needs a 
special “space” for its development and result accumulation, which explains the emergence and functional 
role  of  cortex  in  the  human  brain  as  inevitable  feature  of  conscious  brain  structure,  where  those  bound, 
conscious  states  can  form  and  further  interact  among  them,  giving  rise  to  conscious  “imagination”  and 
similar specific features of independent, internal consciousness dynamics. Correspondingly, the unreduced 
complexity  of  conscious  brain  dynamics  does  not  need  to  be  limited  any  more  to  that  of  a  particular 
environment and can grow to comprise and create ever new features of real or imaginary world. Note that 
similar to purely intrinsic, dynamic origin of classicality from quantum behaviour at the lowest complexity 
levels  that  does  not  need  any  external,  artificially  imposed  “decoherence”  of  the  unitary  theory,  the 
complex-dynamic origin of consciousness results basically from internal brain interactions, using interaction 
with the environment only as a source of “input data” (fixed initially at the unconscious complexity levels). 
We see again that the analogy to quantum complexity levels provides a useful “holographic” reproduction 
of similar complexity development features, but does not imply the direct quantum (microscopic) origin of 
consciousness. 

                                                
5  This  result  is  actually  close  to  the  conclusion  that  a  natural  environment  in  the  whole  cannot  possess  itself  any  kind  of 
emergent, dynamic consciousness, irrespective of its detailed interpretation, while the same environment can, in principle, be 
characterised by a (nonconscious) intelligence determined by the highest complexity of intelligent species living in it (if any).

Consider in more detail the simplest case of a conscious state emergence in a binding interaction of 
two  nonlocal,  globally  chaotic  unconscious  structures.  Each  of  them  is  represented  by  a  quantum  beat 
 realisations 
process at the level of unconscious intelligence, characterised by unceasing change of 
taken in a dynamically random order (let  Nℜ  be the same for both interaction participants, for simplicity of 
expressions  only).  The  probability  of  a  quantum  jump  of  each  of  the  interacting  quantum  beat  processes 
=
1 Nα
towards  any  its  particular,  localised  realisation  is 
,  in  agreement  with  the  general  expression of 
eq. (17a). When the two interacting unconscious structures form a conscious, bound state, the probability 
α
  (whereas  the  probability  of  an  arbitrary 
N
of  their  correlated  jump  in  one  direction  is 
corr
1α = ). Similarly, the probability of n consecutive jumps

N
ℜ
χ  is the length of elementary jump of each component, both of 
distance of chaotic system wandering and 
them expressed in terms of corresponding brain space coordinate ( χ). We see that 
 decreases 
exponentially with  χ, so that the non-interacting (free) bound system will remain localised within its size, 
χ . It is important, however, that the complex-dynamical “internal life” (chaotic realisation 
of the order of 
change)  continues  within  such  localised  conscious  state,  ensuring  its  proper  evolution  in  interaction  with 
other,  conscious  and  unconscious,  brain  states.  We  deal  here  with  essential  difference  between  the 
unreduced, dynamically multivalued self-organisation and its dynamically single-valued (unitary) models in 
the  usual  theory,  which  is  especially  important  for  consistent  description  of  consciousness.  The  latter 
explains, in particular, why the dynamics of consciousness is characterised by much slower processes than 
unconscious (including intelligent) reactions: according to the universal criterion of absence of global chaos 
(SOC  dynamics),  eq.  (28b),  the  system  should  be  far  from  its  main  resonances  in  order  to  preserve  a 
distinct enough, e.g. permanently localised, configuration and changes thus at its slow component rate. 
 
It is not difficult to outline further brain complexity development within its conscious activity. It is 
important that each qualitatively new level of complex brain dynamics as if starts from the beginning in the 
image of the environment complexity it provides. Thus, conscious world reflection in terms of permanently 
localised elementary structures starts representing the same outside world dynamics that has already been 
properly reflected by the unconscious levels of brain dynamics, but now acquires a “new life” in the form of 
permanent and subjectively “controlled” images of real entities that become relatively independent of their 
real prototypes (especially for higher levels of consciousness). When this new, conscious representation of 
reality approaches a correct enough image of the external dynamic complexity, it naturally tends to produce 
a  general  image  of  itself,  appearing  as  a  state  of  awareness  and  giving  rise  to  possible  next  level  of 
consciousness.  This  superior  level  of  consciousness  operates  already  with  indirect  images  of  world 
complexity  from  the  first  level  of  consciousness,  closely  entangled  among  them  in  a  system  of  holistic 
“associations”. This superior consciousness “looks” already upon its own complex-dynamic (and generally 
localised)  images  of  the  external  dynamical  patterns,  at  least  as  much  as  at  those  patterns  directly.  We 
obtain  thus  the  detailed  complex-dynamic  interpretation  of  the  property  of  reflection  of  conscious  brain 
activity.  Since  the  “technical”  capacity  of a large neural network is extremely high [16] (see also below), 
the  hierarchy  of  complex-dynamic  reflection  levels  can  grow  considerably  to  ever  superior  levels  of 
consciousness, where already the lowest level provides the necessary minimum for conscious understanding 
of  the  environment.  The  emergent,  complex-dynamical  consciousness  is  not  only  explicitly  obtained  as  a 
result  of  unreduced  interaction  processes  in  the  brain,  but  possesses  a  hierarchic,  multi-level  structure, 
where each next level provides a qualitatively new, “superior” image of reality, including complex-dynamic 
images  of  all  lower  levels  of  consciousness.  Practical  emergence  of  a  new  complexity  level  needs  the 
suitable stock of latent interaction complexity, or dynamic information (section 2), and is accompanied by a 
dynamic resistance (generalised inertia) of the already existing structures, so that the appearance of a new, 
big  enough  level  of  consciousness  has  the  properties  of  a  revolutionary  change,  or  “generalised  phase 
transition”  [15].  The  persisting  qualitative  difference  between  unitary  and  unreduced  (complex-dynamic) 
reality images in (conscious) knowledge provides a relevant example of different levels of consciousness. 
 
With this general dynamic picture of intelligence and consciousness and their internal development, 
let  us  verify  now  how  exactly  can  it  reproduce  the  known  properties  of  intelligent  and  conscious 

 

23 

 
behaviour (e.g. [1-9]), including those that can be postulated as necessary, empirically based demands for 
artificial  consciousness  systems  [13,14].  Note,  first  of  all,  that  our  complex-dynamic  interpretation  of 
intelligence  and  consciousness  provides  their  well-specified  origins  and  definitions,  including  a  clear-cut 
distinction  between  these  two  “close”  levels  of  higher  brain  activity,  remaining  rather  ambiguous  within 
unitary  approaches  to  both  their  natural  and  artificial  versions.  We  can  proceed  with  the  property  of 
autonomous dynamic adaptability (I), being common for intelligent and conscious reflections of reality. As 
we  have  seen  above,  this  feature  emerges  as  a  universal  property  of  any  unreduced,  complex  interaction 
dynamics  (absent  in  its  unitary  imitation),  while  its  necessary  magnitude  for  the  efficient  intelligence  and 
consciousness is determined by the complexity correspondence principle relating the degree of adaptability 
with the sufficient dynamic complexity of the brain that should exceed that of the controlled environment 
(we provide quantitative estimates below). The “logical”, “binding”, and “supervising” features (II) of a 
conscious system are obtained within the key interpretation of conscious states as physically bound states 
of chaotic quantum beat processes of electro-chemical interactions in the brain neuron system, emerging as 
localised realisations of the whole system of brain interactions at a special complexity level, exceeding and 
therefore  including  all  realisations  from  lower,  unconscious  reflection  of  the  environment.  This  superior 
structure of the level of bound conscious states underlies also all versions of clearly recognised separation 
between  the  “self”,  represented  by  those  dynamically  unified  bound  states  in  the  cortex,  and  the  “rest” 
(environment),  the  latter  being  reflected  already  at  the  lower  level  of  unconscious  intelligence  (III).  The 
superior,  ultimately  emerging  form  of  this  property  is  provided  by  the  complex-dynamic  awareness  (IV) 
described  above,  where  the  bound  conscious  images  of  reality  include  that  of oneself, i.e. the cumulative 
image  of  the  conscious  representation  of  the  environment,  actually  forming  the  next  higher  sublevel  of 
complexity.  In  terms  of  human  species  evolution  (subjectively  interpreted  here),  property  (III)  can  be 
approximately  designated  as  Homo  habilis,  while  its  version  (IV)  would  correspond  to  the  true  Homo 
sapiens.  Practical  abilities  of  a  conscious  brain  (also  present,  in  a  reduced  form,  at  the  level  of 
unconscious  intelligence),  such  as  reality  control  and  self-control,  imagination,  and  anticipation  (V), 
follow  from  the  emergent,  interaction-driven  origin  of  the  corresponding  brain  structures,  where  higher-
level conscious, bound structures acquire their own dynamics, showing only general, weak dependence on 
the environment. The properties of intelligent and conscious systems summarised as emotions, desires, and 
motivations (VI) are manifestations of universal creativity of complex dynamics expressed by the universal 
symmetry (transformation) of complexity (section 2) and appearing also as “élan vital” in the development 
of  any  living  system:  it  is  a  result  of  interaction  potentialities  expressed  by  the  dynamic  information  and 
forced, by the unreduced interaction itself, to develop into the fully unfolded system structure, or dynamic 
entropy. Finally, the sustainable, autonomous growth of intelligence and consciousness (VII) results from 
the  same  complexity  development  of  the  unreduced  interaction  process,  constituting  thus  the  basis  for 
practically unlimited growth of consciousness, as explained above. 
 
In accord with the complexity correspondence principle, any of the above properties (I)-(VII) of the 
dynamically  multivalued,  essentially  nonlinear,  and  intrinsically  creative  interaction  processes  in  the  brain 
neuron  system  cannot  be  properly  reproduced  by  the  usual,  unitary  theory,  just  because  of  its  dynamic 
single-valuedness  and  strictly  zero  value  of  unreduced  dynamic  complexity,  which  is  the  unified, ultimate 
reason of all difficulties and ambiguities in the existing understanding of consciousness [1-11]. Indeed, the 
unitary  reduction  of  real  interaction  by  the  canonical  theory  cannot  explain  even  the  simplest,  quantum 
system behaviour and the lowest complexity levels and is obliged to postulate the “impossible” properties of 
those real systems in the form of “quantum miracles” (see [11,15,16,20-24] for more details). This intrinsic 
deficiency of the unitary theory is inherited by its complexity imitation at higher levels of world dynamics. 
Therefore the existing “general” applications of those effectively zero-dimensional imitations of the unitary 
“science of complexity”, often in a post-modern “hermeneutics” style, can create essential confusion in the 
already quite obscure field of knowledge. Speculative description of consciousness in terms of “attractors” 
and  other  abstract  “models”  of  unitary  theory  (see  e.g.  [51,52])  operates,  in  fact,  with  zero-complexity 
entities  and  is  unable  to  explain  even  much  simpler  structures  than  that  of  conscious  brain  dynamics.  An 
“attractor”  is  produced  by  a  continuous  trajectory of a system with fixed, postulated configuration in an 

 

24 

 

 
abstract,  artificial  “space”  and  therefore  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  real  system  dynamics  based  on  the 
permanent  and  qualitative  change  of  its  configuration,  obtained  as  inevitable,  generic  consequence  of  the 
unreduced  dynamic  equation  solution  (reduced  to  a  trivial  change  of  notations  in  the  conventional, 
effectively  zero-dimensional,  perturbative  “approximation”).  Replacement  of  dynamic,  interaction-driven 
multivaluedness  of  incompatible  system  realisations  (its  different  configurations)  and  probabilistic 
fractality by “multiple attractor basins” produced by a postulated system configuration and coexisting in an 
abstract  space  is  another,  very  rough  verbal  “trick”  of  the  unitary  imitation  of  complexity,  which  cannot 
explain any property of the unreduced system dynamics, but persists nevertheless in many “serious” sources 
on interpretation of its highest-level property, consciousness. 
The huge contrast between the unreduced, dynamically multivalued dynamics of a multi-component 
 
interaction  system  and  its  unitary  projection  appears  in  a  yet  more  transparent  form  within  quantitative 
estimate  of  the total brain power [16]. The unreduced power of a complex-dynamical process, P, i.e. the 
maximum  number  of  operations it can perform per time unit or the number of units of information it can 
store, is proportional to its dynamic complexity  C  as given by the full number of regular realisations  Nℜ :

This  “astonishing”  result  is  certainly  due  to  the  complex-dynamic  parallelism  of  the  unreduced 
interaction dynamics, where the system creates itself, in a real-time mode, the necessary dynamic structures 
and  ways  of  search  for  a  solution.  The  mechanistic  “parallel  information  processing”  does  not  have  this 
property and represents only additive reconfiguration of the same sequential dynamics that cannot provide 
the true gain in power (with the same “hardware” power). Indeed, assuming that the average frequency of 
brain  realisation  change  is  not  less  than  1  Hz  (which  is  a  very  moderate  estimate),  one  can  compare  the 
above estimates of complex-dynamic brain power with the unitary estimate of the “ultimate” computation 
power  for  the  whole  universe  [53]  to  see  that  the  former  remains  “infinitely”  greater  than  the  latter  [16] 
(although  curiously  this  unitary  estimate  of  power  of  very  special,  “quantum”  computation  relies  on  a 
strong  emphasis of “advanced”, “magic” parallelism and “complexity” [54], demonstrating once more the 
absence  of  any  power  in  unitary  imitations  of  complexity).  The  inevitable  payment  for  such  tremendous 
superiority of the unreduced complex-dynamical power takes the form of irreducible dynamic randomness, 
just underlying the above huge efficiency. However, the related uncertainty of result is not really a problem, 
since it can be reduced to a necessary minimum in the multivalued SOC regime, without any essential loss 
of the total operation power. It is easy to see that the huge values of  Pδ  provide a quantitative expression 
of  the  “magic”  qualitative  properties  of  complex  brain  operation,  such  as  those  of  intelligence  and 
consciousness [16]. This conclusion will remain valid for much smaller values of  N  that can be expected 
for  artificial  neural  networks,  thus  underlying  the  corresponding  “magic”  power  also  for  artificial 
intelligence and consciousness, produced by their unreduced, complex (multivalued) dynamics.

4. Complex-dynamic machine consciousness and its social implications 
 

Since the above causal understanding of consciousness is based on the unreduced analysis of a real, 
full-scale  system  of  interacting  elements  explicitly  producing  the  full  version  of  this property, it can form 
the truly scientific, fundamental and rigorous, basis for the machine consciousness concept replacing today 
the previous paradigm of artificial intelligence (section 1) [13,14]. Without rejecting possible more limited, 
dynamically  regular  versions  of  machine  consciousness,  we  shall  consider  now  specific  features  of  its 
unreduced,  complex-dynamic  (multivalued  and  chaotic)  realisation  in  the  artificial  system  of  connected 
elements (neural network), as well as various technological, social and mental implications. 
Note, first of all, that the proposed unreduced, complex-dynamic version of conscious control and 
 
information  systems  should  be  considered  as  inevitable,  qualitatively  new,  and  already  urgently  needed 
stage  of  development  of  modern  technology.  Indeed,  if  we  apply  our  universal  description  of  various 
dynamic  regimes  of  arbitrary  systems  with  interacting  elements  (section  2)  to  modern  technological 
systems,  we  conclude  immediately  that  their  operation  refers  basically  to  the  ultimate,  almost  regular 
regime of multivalued self-organisation. However, as the compositional (configurational) sophistication of 
technological  (and  related  social)  systems  inevitably  grows,  it  finally  and inevitably attains a level, where 
the  unreduced  interaction  complexity  and  related  true  chaoticity  will  appear  explicitly, with a big enough 
magnitude.  This  conclusion  follows  from  the  rigorous  criterion  of  chaos  of  the  universal  science  of 
complexity, eq. (28a), showing that one can avoid explicit, big chaoticity only by maintaining the system far 
away  from  all  its  essential  resonances.  But  as  the  technical  intricacy  of  the  system  grows,  its  resonances 
inevitably approach to each other and one cannot avoid their overlap, and thus essential chaoticity, above 
certain critical intricacy of system composition. Needless to say, this critical level of technical complexity is 
being exceeded by modern technology in a growing number of cases. Since the unitary, regular technology 
paradigm  totally  rejects  those  chaotic  elements,  they  inevitably  appear  in  the  form  of  undesirable  system 
failure,  which  should  be  compensated  by  more  and  more  frequent and inefficient direct, “extra-ordinary” 
human interventions in otherwise automatic processes. Our analysis shows that there is no other issue from 
this  growing  “crisis  of  complexity”,  than  explicit  “acknowledgement”  of  the  unreduced,  really  existing 
dynamic complexity (multivaluedness) of technological interaction processes, followed by transformation of 
its “destructive” influence on the unitary control scheme into huge advantages of its constructive, unlimited 
realisation outlined above. This result and approach applies to any level of technology (and social life) [15], 
but we shall concentrate here on the highest levels related to conscious control systems. 
Such  truly  conscious  technical  systems  of  control  and  communication  can  possess  the  genuine, 
 
complex-dynamic  consciousness  property  (section  3),  but  which  at  the  same  time  differs  essentially from 
the  natural,  human  version  of  consciousness  by  the  characteristic  shape  of  the  conscious  operation 
complexity.  As  we  have  seen  above,  the  true  consciousness  emerges  as  certain,  high  enough  level  of 
dynamic  complexity,  which  exceeds  considerably  those  of living and intelligent systems, having very high 
positions  themselves  in  the  hierarchy  of  world  dynamic  complexity  [15-17].  In  the  case  of  natural 
consciousness,  i.e.  the  one  obtained  within  a  “natural”  (biological)  evolution,  this  means  that  carriers  of 
consciousness should “first” be alive and intelligent in order to have a (generally rare) chance to develop at 
least  a  minimum  level  of  conscious  intelligence.  Since  the  lowest  level  of  “intelligent”  complexity  is 
determined by the maximum environment complexity (in a reduced formulation, the same will be true for 
any living system complexity), it follows that the natural consciousness structure, at its initial, lowest levels, 
is  inevitably  characterised  by  a  specific,  relatively  flat  shape  of  its  hierarchy  of  complexity  (dynamical 
fractal)  resembling  a  “pancake”.  Whereas  the  “consciousness  pancake”  should  have  a  minimal  thickness 
corresponding  to  the  lowest level of consciousness complexity, its relatively large width is inherited from 
the  shape  of  unconsciousness  intelligence  and  comprises  a  high  diversity  of  the  controlled  environment 
complexity (though represented by the properly localised, conscious states of brain activity, as explained in 
section 3). By contrast, the artificial, man-made systems of machine consciousness need not and actually 
should not incorporate the whole “horizontal” diversity of a living environment complexity, but do need to 
have  a  minimum  “vertical”  dimension  of  the  localised  (SOC)  reflection  of  their  limited  environment. 

 

26 

 

 
Therefore  the  systems  of  artificial  consciousness  emerge  in  the  shape  of  relatively  narrow vertical “rods” 
(or  other  “pyramidal”  structures)  in  the  “space”  of  universal  hierarchy  of  complexity.  They  will  have  the 
“air”  (characteristic  behaviour)  of  very  narrow,  but  highly  qualified,  conscious  “specialists”  in  their 
particular  environment,  knowing  very  much  about  it,  but  very  little  beyond  it,  and  therefore  suddenly 
becoming  very  “stupid”  just  outside  of  their  “professional  interests”  (this  phenomenon  is  known,  in  its 
milder  form,  also  for  human  consciousness  realisations).  Let  us  emphasize  once  more  that  such  limiting, 
“vertical” shape of a carrier of consciousness complexity would be impossible for any truly natural, living 
system, but can and should be realised for (truly) conscious machines, providing a fundamental, rigorously 
substantiated basis for their creation and making the latter much more realistic (as opposed to an ill-defined 
imitation  of  the  full  human  consciousness).  Therefore  we  can  propose  this  conclusion  as  a well-specified 
scientific  basis  for  the  concept  and  paradigm  of  artificial,  but  genuine  consciousness  (and  thus  also 
intelligence), including its rigorously derived definition in terms of the above level and shape of unreduced 
dynamic complexity. 
Taking  into  account  the  complex-dynamic  machine  consciousness  thus  specified,  we  can  further 
 
advance  towards  scientifically  rigorous  understanding  of  social  and  mental  implications  of  artificial 
consciousness  by  considering  the  next  interaction  level  between  conscious  machines  and  natural 
consciousness  carriers.  It  is  easy  to  see,  for  example,  that  practical,  professionally  intense  interaction 
between  “complexity  rods”  of  conscious  machines  and  “pancakes”  of  minimum  levels  of  natural 
consciousness  provides  an  efficient  way  of  otherwise  difficult  development  of  natural  consciousness 
towards its higher-level, less flat shapes, where multiple “rods” of artificial consciousness would “impose”, 
at  least  partially,  their  “vertical”  dimensions  to  a  naturally  diverse,  but vertically limited consciousness of 
living beings. In other words, interaction with (truly) conscious machines can become a very efficient, and 
quite  possible  the  only  real,  way  of  massive  natural  consciousness  development.  A  complementary 
conclusion,  following  from  the  complexity  correspondence  principle  (or  the  underlying  symmetry  of 
complexity),  states  that  systems  of  artificial  consciousness  cannot  exceed  the  level  of  consciousness 
(complexity)  of  their  creators,  which  in  our  case  are  assumed  to  be  carriers  of  natural  consciousness.  At 
this point we switch from mental to social aspects because it follows that the only consistent dynamics of 
progressive (complexity-increasing) society development can result from (massive) interaction of its lower-
consciousness members with conscious artefacts produced by efforts of members with (essentially) higher 
consciousness  level  (if  any).  One  consequence  is  that  society  that  does  not  contain  members  with  big 
enough  difference  of  their  consciousness  levels  or  cannot  realise  it  in  a  form  of  efficient  interaction,  is 
unable of complexity development and therefore condemned to disappearance: any other interactions (e.g. 
using  only  zero-complexity  machines  of  the  unitary  technology)  cannot  provide  complexity  growth  to 
higher levels of consciousness. It is impossible not to note that this rigorously derived conclusion directly 
contradicts  the  currently  dominating  egalitarian  social  doctrine  of  a  “democratic”  flavour  (often  trickily 
exploited).  On  the  other  hand,  one  may  argue  that  interaction  between  higher-  and  lower-consciousness 
society  members  can  proceed  by  their  direct,  “natural”  communication,  including  science,  education,  etc. 
However,  the  experience  clearly  demonstrates  too  low,  “subcritical”  efficiency  of  such  “natural” 
interaction,  even  in  the  best  cases,  which  is  additionally  hampered  by  inevitable  intervention  of machine-
intermediated  interaction  within  a  technically  developed  civilisation,  where  the  unitary,  zero-complexity 
machines  impose  their  ultimately  low  complexity  to  the  whole  system  of  strong  mental  and  social 
interactions  and  its  results.  In  this  situation  the  qualitatively  new,  complex-dynamic,  intelligent  and 
conscious  machinery  can be the only realistic, and actually very strong, catalyst of natural consciousness 
development within a machine-based civilisation, underlying its development in the whole [15]. 
 
Inspired by this great purpose of the genuine machine consciousness paradigm, we can turn now to 
discussion of practical details of its realisation, following from the above description (sections 2, 3). Since 
in  principle  there  is  no  problem  today  with  fabrication  of  elaborated  enough  networks  of  connected 
elements  (“neural  networks”),  the  specific  features  of  conscious  networks  involve  their detailed structure 
and  imposed  operation  modes.  The  general  conclusion  of  our  analysis  implies  that  the  true,  complex-
dynamic  intelligence  and  consciousness  can  appear  only  in  a  system  with  high  enough  freedom  of 

 

27 

 
interaction  between  elements  that  cannot  be  based  on  pre-programmed,  regular  interaction  rules  and 
detailed  results  as  it  occurs  for  all  unitary  machines.  Any  detailed  programming  of  regular  interaction 
details should be abandoned in the case of complex-dynamical devices in favour of their natural, dynamic 
complexity development, though occurring in a general direction determined by the universal symmetry of 
complexity and the ensuing particular laws (section 2). 

implies 

A  more  specific  result  of 

the  above  consciousness  analysis  (section  3) 

that 
intelligent/conscious  system  interactions  cannot  be  reduced  only  to  local  “rapid”  (electric)  connections 
between  individual  elements,  but  should  also  include  a  complementary  distributed,  dissipative,  “slow” 
component necessary for efficient dynamic unification and stability of artificial brain dynamics in the form 
of  generalised  quantum  beat. In the natural brain such component is provided most probably by chemical 
neuron structure and interactions, but such “bio-inspired” construction of artificial conscious systems may 
be  not  the  easiest  one.  Another  candidate  for  that  “slow”  interaction  component  is  provided  by  properly 
configured  magnetic  materials  and  interactions,  “repeating”  generally  (but  not  exactly)  the  electric 
connection interface and interacting with it “almost everywhere”. It is not difficult to see that the detailed 
realisation and principles of construction of such explicitly complex-dynamic networks will be very different 
from  the  now  realised  unitary  approach  and  technology,  but  as  we  have  shown  above,  this  way  of 
development is objectively inevitable and unique at its next stage starting already today (see also ref. [16] 
for similar results for the real nanotechnology). 
 
In conclusion, we would like to emphasize once more the far going mental and social implications 
of the genuine artificial consciousness paradigm that have been briefly outlined above and would certainly 
need  further  development  using  this  intrinsically  interdisciplinary  approach.  The  general  motivation  for 
these studies is as big as civilisation development in the whole, since the above rigorous analysis shows the 
indispensable,  unique  role  of  complex-dynamic  (multivalued)  interaction  processes  and  technology  for 
progressive  civilisation  development  today  (see  also  [15,16]  for  the  universal  concept  of  development). 
Since the artificially produced, technical structures play a major and ever growing role at any scale of world 
development  that  cannot  be  abandoned  or  turned  back,  increasing  replacement  of  their  currently 
dominating,  complexity-suppressive  design  and  operation  mode  by  the  unreduced,  explicitly  complex-
dynamic technology, inevitably comprising key elements of genuine machine consciousness, emerges as the 
objectively  substantiated,  uniquely  progressive  way  of  development,  including  creative  progress  of 
individual  natural  consciousness  as  its  inherent  component.  Note  finally  that  the  use  of  much  more 
restricted,  unitary  versions  of  machine  consciousness  that  can  only  imitate,  but  not  reproduce  the 
unreduced consciousness features (see their list by items (I)-(VII) in section 3), can be considered as a first-
step motion in the same direction of growing complexity, which should not replace, however, the search for 
and practical realisation of explicitly complex-dynamic, truly intelligent and conscious machinery.

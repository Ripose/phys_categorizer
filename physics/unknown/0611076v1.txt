ABSTRACT 

Particle accelerators technology is one of the generic technologies which is locomotive of the 
development in almost all fields of science and technology. According to the U.S. Department 
of Energy: Accelerators underpin every activity of the Office of Science and, increasingly, of 
the entire scientific enterprise. From biology to medicine, from materials to metallurgy, from 
elementary  particles  to  the  cosmos,  accelerators  provide  the  microscopic  information  that 
forms the basis for scientific understanding and applications. The combination of ground and 
satellite based observatories and particle accelerators will advance our understanding of our 
world, our galaxy, our universe, and ourselves. 

Because  of  this,  accelerator  technology  should  become  widespread  all  over  the  world. 
Existing situation shows that a large portion of the world, namely the South and Mid-East, is 
poor  on  the  accelerator  technology.  UNESCO  has  recognized  this  deficit  and  started 
SESAME project in Mid-East, namely Jordan. Turkic Accelerator Complex (TAC) project is 
more  comprehensive  and  ambitious  project,  from  the  point  of  view  of  it  includes  light 
sources, particle physics experiments and proton and secondary beam applications. 

At this stage, TAC project includes: 

•  Linac-ring type charm factory 
•  Synchrotron light source based on positron ring  
•  Free electron laser based on electron linac 
•  GeV scale proton accelerator 
•  TAC-Test Facility. 
 

First part of this presentation is devoted to general status of particle accelerators around the 
world. The second part deal with the status of the TAC proposal. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The  title  of  this  paper  is  inspired  by  the  statement  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Energy  titled 
“Accelerator  Technolgy  for  the  Nation”  [1].  Keeping  in  mind  that  particle  accelerators  are 
widely used in almost all fields of science and technology, accelerator technology should be 
included  into  R&D  programme  in  all  countries  over  the  world.  In  this  context,  developed 
nations  should  support  the  knowledge  transfer  to  developing  ones.  SESAME-like  projects 
should be realized in all regions which are poor on the accelerator technology. 
 

2. PARTICLE ACCELERATORS AROUND THE WORLD 

 

The  status  of  accelerator  technology  and  its  applications  is  reflected  at  large-scale  biennial 
conferences:  USA  Particle  Accelerator  Conference  (PAC),  European  Particle  Accelerator 
Conference (EPAC) and Asian Particle Accelerator Conference (APAC). Proceedings of these 
conferences, as well as a number of other accelerator events, are collected at Joint Accelerator 

Conferences Website [2]. An excellent review was presented at EPAC2000 by U. Amaldi [3] 
(see also [4]).  

 
Figure 1: The Time Tree gives a pictorial view of the development of the applications 
of accelerators in both modification processes and sample analyses [3]. 

The classification of the 15000 accelerators around the world in 2000 according to application 
fields  is  given  in  the  Table  1.  In  1994  the  total  number  of  accelerators  was  about  10000, 
therefore, the progression rate is about 15% per year.

2.1. FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH: PARTICLE AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS 

It is seen from the Table 1 that less than 1% of accelerators are used for fundamental research 
in particle and nuclear physics. The obvious flagman’s are CERN [5], FNAL [6], DESY [7], 
SLAC [8] and KEK [9].   

2.1.1. ENERGY FRONTIERS 

An  exploration  of  (multi-)TeV  scale  at  constituent  level  is  the  main  goal  of  High  Energy 
Physics in a foreseen future. At the end of the last century, four ways to TeV scale, namely, 
ring  type  hadron  machines,  linear  electron-positron  machines,  ring  type  muon  colliders  and 
linac-ring type lepton-hadron colliders were discussed (see [10] and references therein). Today, 
we deal with following situation: 
 

•  Hadron colliders. The LHC with 14 TeV center-of-mass energy will start hopefully in 

2007 and the hundred-TeV energy VLHC is under consideration. 

•  Linear colliders. The CLIC is the sole machine with energy more than 1 TeV, and a 3 

TeV center-of-mass energy is considered as third stage. 

•  Muon colliders. After the boom in 1990’s, main activity is transferred to the ν-factory 

•  Lepton-hadron colliders. The sole realistic way to (multi-)TeV scale is represented by 

options. 

linac-ring type machines. 

 

Therefore,  as  the  second  way  to  (multi-)TeV  scale,  linac-ring  type  lepton-hadron  colliders 
require more attention of the HEP community. Referring to reviews [10-14] for more details 
of these machines, as well as their additional γp, eA, γA and FELγA options, let me present 
here  non-conventional  approach  to  future  energy  frontiers  for  HEP:  It  may  be  well  possible 
that, instead of constructing linear e+e- colliders in the first stage, more attention must be paid 
to realizing linac-ring type ep colliders with the same electron beam energy (see Table 2).

It  is  known  that  lepton-hadron  collisions  have  been  playing  a  crucial  role  in  exploration  of 
deep inside of matter. For example, the quark-parton model was originated from investigation 
of  electron-nucleon  scattering.  The  HERA  with  √s  ≈  0.3  TeV  has  opened  a  new  era  in  this 

field extending the kinematics region by two orders both in high Q2 and small x with respect 
to  fixed  target  experiments.  However,  the  region  of  sufficiently  small  x  (≤  10-5)  and 
simultaneously  high  Q2  (≥  10  GeV2),  where  saturation  of  parton  densities  should  manifest 
itself, is not currently achievable. The investigation of physics phenomena at extreme small x 
but sufficiently high Q2 is very important for understanding the nature of strong interactions at 
all levels from nucleus to partons.  

At  the  same  time,  the  results  from  lepton-hadron  colliders  are  necessary  for  adequate 
interpretation  of  physics  at  future  hadron  colliders.  Concerning  LHC,  which  hopefully  will 
start in 2007, a √s ≈ 1 TeV ep collider will be very useful in earlier 2010’s when precision era 
at LHC will begin. 

Finally,  multi-TeV  center  of  mass  energy  ep  colliders  are  competitive  to  future  hadron  and 
lepton colliders in search for the BSM physics.

structure of matter over time from Rutherford experiment to CLIC≈VLHC. 

 

2.1.2. PARTICLE FACTORIES 

Particle  factories  represent  rather  high  luminosity  than  high  energy  frontiers.  The  aim  is 
copious production of known particles in order to investigate their properties in details. These 
machines  can  be  grouped  as  electron-positron  colliders  (i.e.  B,  Charm,  Tau  factories)  and 
secondary  beams  from  high  intensity  proton  accelerators  (i.e.  neutrino  factories,  meson 
factories etc). TAC Charm factory belongs to the first group.

2.2. OTHER FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 

It is seen from the Table 1 that more than 99% of accelerators are used in different fields of 
science and technology. Referring to reviews [3, 4] for more details let us mention that today 
two more rows should be added to the Table 1. Namely, neutron spallation sources and free 
electron  lasers.  The  latter  is  called  the  fourth  generation  light  source.  Concerning  the  third 
generation light sources, namely synchrotron radiation, their map is presented in Figure 4.

3. THE STATUS OF TURKIC ACCELERATOR COMPLEX PROPOSAL 

Approximately 10 years ago, linac-ring type charm-tau factory with synchrotron light source 
was proposed as a regional project for elementary particle physics [17]. Starting from 1997, a 
small  group  from  Ankara  and  Gazi  Universities  begins  a  feasibility  study  for  the  possible 
accelerator complex in Turkey with the support of Turkish State Planning Organization (DPT) 
[18]. The results of the study is published in [19] and presented at EPACs [20, 21]. Starting 
from  2002,  the  conceptual  design  study  of  the  TAC  project  has  started  with  a  relatively 
enlarged  group  (again  with  the  DPT  support).  For  the  future  plans,  see  the  section  on  time 
schedule. 

At this stage, TAC project includes: 

•  Linac-ring type charm factory 
•  Synchrotron light source based on positron ring 
• 
 Free electron laser based on electron linac 
•  GeV scale proton accelerator 
•  TAC-Test Facility. 
 

The schematic view of the factory and light sources part of the Turkic Accelerator Complex is 
given in the Figure below. 

 

 

 

  

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.1. TAC CHARM FACTIRY 

 

Up to now, we have analyzed linac-ring type φ, charm and τ factory options. In principle L = 
1034cm-2s-1  can  be  achieved  for  all  three  options.  Concerning  φ factory  option,  existing 
DAφNE φ factory has nominal L = 5×1032cm-2s-1 and possible upgrades to higher luminosities 
are  under  consideration  [22].  Therefore,  physics  search  potential  for  the  φ factory  will  be 
essentially exhausted before TAC commissioning. Concerning τ factory option, whereas e+e- 
→ τ+τ- cross-section achieves to maximum value at √s = 2.2 GeV, this advantage is dissipated 
with  success  of  B-factories  which  has  luminosity  of  1034cm-2s-1 already. Moreover super B-
factories with L = 1036cm-2s-1 are intensively discussed [23]. 

For  these  reasons,  we  inclined  towards  charm  factory  option.  The  center  of  mass  energy  is 
fixed by the mass of ψ (3770) resonance. Existing CLEO-c [24] works with 1032cm-2s-1. The 
BEP charm factory proposal [25] has design luminosity of 1033cm-2s-1. Therefore, TAC charm 
factory with 1034cm-2s-1, planned to work in mid 2010’s, will contribute charm physics greatly. 
Differing  from  K  and  B  mesons,  where  possible  new  physics  manifest  itself  as  a  deviation 
from standard model (SM) background, D mesons has negligible SM background. The main 
parameter  set  for  TAC  charm  factory  is  presented  in  Table  1.  The  restriction  on  luminosity 
coming from linac beam power can be relaxed by using of energy recovery linac. This topic is 
under study (recently the possibility of TAC Super-Carm Factory is discussed [16]).

The  luminosity  spectrum  dL/dWcm  obtained  using  GUINEA-PIG  simulation  program  [29] 
with ΔE/E = 10-3 is plotted in Figure 2. It is seen that center of mass energy spread is well 
below ΓΨ(3S) ≈ 24 MeV. Expected number of Ψ(3S) is about 109 per working year (107 s). Let 
us remind that D+D- and D0D0 decay modes are dominant channels for Ψ(3S) decays.

3.2. TAC SYNCHROTRON LIGHT SOURCE 
 
Ref.  [17]  had  considered  additional  positron  storage  ring  dedicated  to  production  of 
synchrotron radiation. Because of beam-beam tune shift restriction, the emittance of colliding 
beams in standard (ring-ring) type colliders inevitably should be chosen to be relatively large 
to obtain high luminosity:

where  subscript  e  (p)  corresponds  to  electron  (positron).    This  restricts  the  performance  of 
synchrotron radiation obtained from insertion devices placed in standard type colliders.  

Fortunately,  this  is  not  the  case  for  linac-ring  type  machines.  In  this  case,  emittance  of  the 
positron beam does not essentially affect luminosity performance of the co llider:

Therefore, the emittance of the positron beam can be chosen small enough to behave as a third 
generation light source in principle. Normalized emittance of the positron beam given in Table 
1 corresponds to transverse emitance of 3 nm·rad, which is well below 20 nm·rad (upper limit 
for third generation SR sources). 

Main  parameters  of  TAC  SR  Facility  were  reported  at  EPAC  2000  [20].  Since  then, 
construction  of  SESAME  [26]  has  begun  in  Jordan  and  CANDLE  [27]  project  has  been 
developed in Armenia. For this reason, final decision on the number of insertion devices and 
beam lines of TAC SR Facility and their specifications will be made depending on realization 
of SESAME and CANDLE projects as well as on user potential in our region.  

Several samples of optical beam lines design and related studies on TAC SR facility can be 
found in [28].  

 
3.3. TAC FREE ELECTRON LASER 
 
Main linac of the TAC charm factory can be operated separately to obtain FEL as seen from 
Figure  1.  FEL  operation  is  foreseen  during  the  maintenance  of  the  collider.  With  1  GeV 
electron beam wave length of SASE FEL photons is expected to be 6.4 nm as in TTF-2 FEL. 
Detailed studies for different electron beam energies were presented at national conferences 
[28].  
 
 
3.4. TAC PROTON ACCELERATOR 
 
TAC proton accelerator proposal consists of 100÷300 MeV energy linear pre-accelerator and 
1÷5 GeV main ring. The average beam current values for these machines would be ~30 mA 
and ~0.3 mA, respectively. Proton beams from two different points of the synchrotron will be 
forwarded  to  neutron  and  muon  regions,  where  a  wide  spectrum  of  applied  research  is 
planned. In muon region, together with fundamental investigations such as test of QED and 
muonium-antimuonium  oscillations,  a  lot  of  applied  investigations  such  as  High-Tc 

superconductivity, phase transitions, impurities in semiconductors et cetera will be performed 
using the powerful Muon Spin Resonance (μSR) method. In neutron region investigations in 
different  fields  of  applied  physics,  engineering,  molecular  biology  and  fundamental  physics 
are planned.  

3.5. TAC TEST FACILITY 

Before building charm factory to obtain training of the young accelerator physicists and to get 
experience on accelerator technology on smaller scale, we plan to build infrared free electron 
laser (IR FEL) on 20÷50 MeV e-linac until 2009. IR FEL thought to work in oscillator mode. 
With undulator strength parameter K=1 and vertical distance between magnet poles g=3 cm, 
one can obtain wavelength values of 15 μm (IR FEL1) and 2 μm (IR FEL2) for 10 MeV and 
50  MeV  e-linac  choices,  respectively.  Three  experimental  stations  are  planed  to  make 
research on biomedical subjects, semiconductor physics and photo chemical reactions.

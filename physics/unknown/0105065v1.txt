We  report  an  experimental  demonstration  of  photon  switching  by  quantum  interference  in  a  four-level 

atomic  system  proposed  by  Harris  and  Yamamoto  (Phys.  Rev.  Lett.  81,  3611  (1998)).  Quantum 

interference inhibits single-photon absorption but enhances third-order, two-photon type absorption in the 

four-level  system.  We  have  observed  greatly  enhanced  nonlinear  absorption  in  the  four-level system 

realized with cold  87Rb atoms and demonstrated fast switching of the nonlinear absorption with a pulsed 

pump laser.

 Linear and nonlinear optical properties of an atomic medium can be modified by coherence and quantum 

interference that utilizes electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [1-8]. Because the vanishing linear 

absorption  and  large  enhancement  of  nonlinear polarizability in an EIT medium, nonlinear optics may be 

studied  at  low  light  levels  [9].  This  has  lead  to  interest  of  EIT  related  phenomena  in  multi-level atomic 

systems. There have been several studies of nonlinear spectral features in  four-level atomic systems [10-

12].  Recently,  Harris  and  Yamamoto  described  a  four-level  EIT  atomic  system  that  exhibits  greatly 

enhanced  third-order susceptibility but has vanishing linear susceptibility [13]. In dispersive response, the 

EIT system exhibits giant Kerr nonlineaity [14] while in absorptive response, the EIT system absorbs only 

two photons, but not one photon. This feature may be used to realize an optical switch where a laser pulse 

controls  absorption  of  another  laser  field  at  different  frequency  [13].  Recently,  we  reported  an 

experimental  study  of  the  enhanced  nonlinear  absorption  in  the  EIT  system  [15].    Here  we  report  an 

experimental  demonstration  of  absorptive  photon  switching  in  the  four-level  EIT  system.  We  have 

observed  switch  on  and  off  of  the  probe absorption for both a cw probe laser and a pulsed probe laser 

following the rise and fall of the switching laser pulse and the experimental results agree with theoretical 

calculations.  

    An energy-level diagram for 87Rb atoms used in our experiment is depicted in Fig. 1(a). A coupling laser 
drives  the  D1  F=2ﬁ F'=1  transition  at  795  nm  and  creates  dressed  atomic  states  |+>  and  |-> 
(|3>-|2>)).  A  weak  probe  laser  drives  the  D1 F=1ﬁ F'=1 transition 
(|+>= 1

(|3>+|2>)  and  |->= 1

and forms a standard  L

-type configuration for EIT. A switching laser drives the D2 F=2ﬁ F'=3 transition 

at  780  nm.  The  probe  laser  and  the  switching  laser  are  linearly  polarized  parallel  with  each  other  and 

perpendicular  to  the  linearly  polarized  coupling  laser.  The  induced  transitions  among  the  magnetic  sub-

levels by the three lasers can be grouped together according to the selection rules and form a manifold of 

four-level  systems. To  a  good  approximation,  the  coupled  Rb  system  can  be  viewed  as  equivalent  to  a 

generic  four-level system treated in Ref. [13]. The validity of such a simplification has been supported by 

several  previous  EIT-type  studies  in  alkaline  atoms  [16-18].  For  later  discussions,  g,   W

 and  W

' are 

defined  as  Rabi  frequencies  for  the  probe  transition  |1>ﬁ
|4> respectively. D c=w c-w 32, D
switching transition |2>ﬁ

|3>,  the  coupling  transition  |2>ﬁ
|3>, and the 
'=w s-w 42 and D =w p-w 31 denote the frequency 

detunings  of  the  coupling  laser,  the  switching  laser  and  probe laser, respectively. The absorptive photon

switching occurs under the condition, D c=D

'=D =0.  

   Photon  switching  in  the  four-level  atomic  system  is  based  on  the  interference  enhanced  nonlinear 

absorption  and  inhibited  linear  absorption.  A  simple  physical  picture  can  be  given  by  a  dressed  state 

analysis [19]. It can be shown that the single-photon absorption experiences destructive interference and 

vanishes  at  the  line  center  of  the  probe  transition  (D =0) while the two-photon absorption in the dressed 
states interferes constructively, which leads to large enhancement at D =0. If the dephasing g 21 is negligible, 

the probe field only experiences nonlinear absorption at  D =0. The nonlinear absorption coefficient is given 

by

length).  Im(r 13)  is  negative  and  is  proportional  to  the intensity of the switching laser [15]. So the probe 

absorption can be turned on and off by the switching laser, thus, realizing absorptive photon switching. Im 
(r 13) is optimized at a moderate to weak coupling Rabi frequency  W  with the maximum value of Im (r 13) 
=  -g/(2G 3)  [15].  This  value  of  the  nonlinear  absorption  should  be  compared  with  the  resonant  linear 

absorption in a simple two-level system. In a simple two-level system (states |1> and |3> only) coupled by 

a weak laser field with a Rabi frequency g, the linear absorption amplitude at the resonance is given by Im 
(r 13)=-g/G 3.  Therefore,  the  amplitude  of  the  nonlinear  absorption  in  the  four-level  EIT  system  may 

approach 50% of the amplitude of the linear absorption in an isolated two-level system [9]. Thus, the four-

level system exhibits unusually large nonlinear absorption at low light intensities without any single-photon, 

linear absorption.     

      Our experiments is done in a vapor-cell magneto-optical trap (MOT) produced in the center of a 10-

ports,  4-1/2"  diameter,  stainless-steel  vacuum  chamber  pumped  down  to  a  pressure  ~  10-9  torr.  An 

extended-cavity  diode  laser  with  output  power  of  ~40  mW  is  used  as  the  cooling  and  trapping  laser. 

Another  extended  cavity  diode  laser  with  output  power  of  ~15  mW  is  used  as  the  repump  laser.  The 

diameter of the trapping laser beams and the repumping laser beam is ~ 1.5 cm. The trapped  87Rb atom 

cloud  is  ~  2  mm  in  diameter  and  contains  ~  108  atoms.  The  weak  probe  laser  is  provided  by  a  third 

extended-cavity  diode  laser  with  a  beam  diameter  ~  0.8  mm  and  power  attenuated  to  ~  1  m W. The 

coupling field is provided by a fourth extended-cavity diode laser with a beam diameter ~ 3 mm and output 

 

4

power  ~  20  mW.  A  Ti:Sapphire  laser  (Coherent  899-21) with a beam diameter ~ 3 mm is used as the 

switching laser. The simplified experimental scheme is depicted in Fig. 1(b). The probe laser, the coupling 

laser,  and  the  switching  laser  are  overlapped  with  the  trapped  Rb  cloud  and  the  transmitted  light  of  the 

probe laser is recorded by a fast photodiode. The laser intensities are varied by neutral density filters. The 

experiment is run in a sequential mode with a repetition rate of 10 Hz and the time sequence is shown in 

Fig. 1(c). All lasers can be turned on or off by Acousto-Optic Modulators (AOM) according to the time 

sequence  described  below.    For  each  period  of  t5-t1=100  ms,  t5-t4=99.4  ms  is  used  for  cooling  and 

trapping of the Rb atoms during which the trap laser and the repump laser are turned on by two separate 

AOMs  and  the  coupling  laser,  the  switching  laser,  and  the  probe  laser  are  off.  The time  for  the probe 

transmission measurements lasts ~ t4-t1=0.6 ms during which the trap laser and the repump laser are turned 
off and the coupling laser with its frequency fixed on the D1 F=2ﬁ F'=1 transition is turned on by a third 

AOM.  Three  specific  measurements  are  made  according  to  the  following  configurations.  First,  for  the 

measurement of the probe absorption spectrum, the weak probe laser is on all the time and the switching 
laser with its frequency fixed on the D2 F=2ﬁ F'=3 transition is turned on  by a fourth AOM at the same 

time t1 as the coupling laser, and the pulse durations of the coupling laser and the switching laser are equal. 
After a 0.1 ms delay, the probe laser frequency is scanned across the D1 F=1ﬁ F'=1 transition in ~0.1 ms 

and  the  probe  transmission  versus  its  frequency  is  recorded.  Second,  for  the  photon  switching 

demonstration of the cw probe laser, the switching laser is turned on 0.1 ms after the coupling laser pulse 
and its pulse duration t3-t2 can be varied from 1 m s to 200 m s. The frequency of the probe laser is fixed on 
the  D1  F=1ﬁ F'=1  transition  and  the  probe  transmission  versus  time  is  recorded.  Third,  for  the  photon 

switching of a pulsed probe laser, the probe laser is turned on by a fifth AOM and has a pulse duration 

equal  to  that  of  the  switching  pulse  as  shown  in  Fig.  1(c).  The  transmitted  probe  pulse  versus  time  is 

recorded.     

   Fig. 2 shows the measured transmission spectrum of the weak probe laser versus its frequency detuning 

. The experimental data are plotted in solid lines while the dotted lines are numerical calculations of the 

four-level system depicted in Fig. 1(a). Fig. 2a shows the measured probe spectrum when the switching 
'=D c=0. The central peak (at  D =0) in Fig. 2a 
laser is on. The data are recorded under the  condition of  D

corresponds  to  the  pure  two-photon type absorption enhanced by the constructive interference while the 

D
 

5

two side peaks at  D ~±W/2  represent the one-photon absorption of the dressed states. For comparison, 

Fig.  2b  shows  the  measured  probe  spectrum  under  identical  experimental  conditions  but  without  the 

switching  laser.  The  nonlinear  absorption  peak  at  D =0  disappears.    It  represents  the  EIT  spectrum 
-type Rb system. The coherence dephasing rate g 21, due to the atom collisions and the 

observed in the  L

off-resonant laser excitation, is estimated to be ~ 103 s-1, which is negligibly small under our experimental 

conditions.  Small  residual  absorption  (~2%)  at  D =0 in the EIT spectrum is likely due to the effect of the 

finite laser linewidths. From the EIT spectrum, the Rabi frequency of the coupling laser is deduced to be 

˜9  MHz.  The  Rabi  frequencies  of  the  switching  laser  and  probe  laser  are  estimated  from  the  laser 

powers and beam diameters, which are  W

'˜15 MHz, g˜1 MHz respectively. These parameters are then 

used in the numerical calculations shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 2. Since the laser pulse durations are 
much greater than the atomic decay times 1/G 3 (30 ns) and 1/G 4 (27 ns), the measurements are carried out 

essentially  in  the  steady-state  regime  and  the  steady-state  analysis  is  validated.  Fig.  2a  shows  that  the 

observed  single-pass,  probe  nonlinear  absorption  at  D =0  is  ~  30%.  From  the  measured  percentage 

absorption of the two peaks in the EIT spectrum of Fig. 2b, we deduce that the linear probe absorption at 
the center of the D1 F=1ﬁ F'=1 transition without the coupling laser is ~ 70%. So the measured nonlinear 

absorption is ~ 42% of the linear absorption in a simple two-level system, which agrees with the theoretical 

calculation.  

   Fig. 3 shows the absorptive photon switching of the cw probe laser by a pulsed switching laser. The 

probe  absorption  is  turned  on  and  off  by  the  switching  pulse,  which  leads  to  a  pulsed,  stepwise  probe 

transmission  profile.  The  bandwidth  of  the  two-photon absorption is determined by the EIT width that is 
2/G 3.  Therefore,  the  switching  speed  is  set  by  the  EIT  width  [13]. 

given  by  the  smaller  of  W

 and  W

Although  a  small  EIT  width  is  necessary  for  obtaining  the  maximum  nonlinear  absorption,  it  may 

compromise  the  optical  switching  time.  As  W

  decreases,  the  decay  (fall)  time  of  the  probe  absorption 

increases  rapidly  after  the  switching  laser  is  turned  off.  The  numerical  calculation  shows  that  for 
3)˜30 ns; for  W =G 3=5.3 
W =2G 3=10.6  MHz,  the  decay  time  associated  with  the  EIT  width  is  ~1/(2p
MHz,  the  decay  time  increases  to  ~  2.5/(2p

3)˜70  ns.  In  our  experiment,  the  rise  and  fall  time  of  the 

switching laser pulse is ~ 150 ns (limited by the turn-on time of the AOM) so the optimal Rabi frequency 
that does not limit the switching time, yet still leads to a large nonlinear absorption, is  W ~2G 3. Then, the 

W

G

switching time of the probe absorption essentially follows the rise and fall time of the switching pulse. Fig. 

3a plots the output intensity of the probe laser versus time for a pair of W
 values with a simulated switching 
pulse  derived  from  the  experiment.  When  W =2G 3 (dashed  curve),  the  switching  time  of  the  probe 
absorption follows the rise and fall time of the switching pulse; when W =G 3 (solid curve), the decay time of 

the probe absorption becomes larger due to the smaller EIT width. The experimental data for the photon 

switching demonstration are plotted in Fig. 3b. The switching pulse with 1 m s duration (the upper curve) is 

turned on at t=0 (0.1 ms after the coupling laser is turned on). The probe transmission versus time (the two 

lower curves) shows that the probe absorption is switched on and off by the switching pulse and the peak 

absorption is about 30%. The observed switching time  of the probe absorption in Fig. 3b follows the rise 

and fall time of the switching laser pulse for W

˜10 MHz (dashed line). At W

˜ 5 MHz (solid line), the decay 

time  of  the  probe  absorption  becomes  longer  due  to  the  smaller  EIT  width,  in  agreement  with  the 

theoretical calculations in Fig. 5a. We have varied the pulse duration of the switching laser from 1  m s to 

200  m s  and  observed  that  the  time  duration  of  the  probe  absorption  follows  that  of  the  switching  laser 

pulse.  

   Fig. 4 shows the absorptive switching of a pulsed probe laser by a pulsed switching laser. The two pulses 

have the same duration (~1  m s) and overlap with each other in time as shown in Fig. 1(c). Fig. 4(a) plots 

the theoretical calculations of the normalized output intensity of the probe pulse Iout(t). The rise (fall) time 

of  the  switching  pulse  and  the  input  probe  pulse  are  taken  to  be  150  ns  to  match  the  experimental 

conditions. The upper dashed line is the output probe pulse when the switching pulse is absent. The two 

lower  traces  are  the  output  probe  pulses  when  the  switching  pulse  is  on.  The  Rabi  frequency  of  the 

coupling laser is  W

˜10 MHz (solid line) and 5 MHz (dot-dashed line). The output pulse of the probe laser 

shows  a  transient  peak  near  the  switching  time  t=0  in  a  time  interval  about  equal  to  the  lifetime  of  the 

excited state |3> and then decays to a quasi-steady-state value. The decay time depends on the EIT width 

and is longer for smaller  W

 values. When the switching pulse and the input probe pulse are turned off, the 

output probe pulse is switched off smoothly and follows the fall time of the input pulse. Fig. 4b presents the 

measured  output  probe  pulse  without  the  switching  laser  pulse  (the  upper  dashed  line)  and  with  the 

switching laser pulse (the two lower traces, corresponding to the  W

 values in Fig. 4a). With the switching 

pulse on, the measured output pulses show the quick transient rise at the switching time and then exhibit the 

 

7

noticeable  slower  decay  at  the  smaller  W

  value  due  to  the  reduced  EIT  width,  in  agreement  with  the 

theoretical calculations. The intensity attenuation of the output probe pulse is about 30% and 25% for the 

two  W

  values  respectively. We have also varied the pulse duration of the switching laser and the probe 

laser from 1  m s to ~100  m s and observed that the transmitted probe pulse shows the transient rise and fall 

at the turn on time and then switches off smoothly with a lineshape similar to that shown in Fig. 4(b).  

    In  conclusion,  we  have  observed  large  third-order  nonlinear  absorption  and  demonstrated  the 

absorptive photon switching by the constructive quantum interference in cold 87Rb atoms. Because the EIT 

cancellation of single-photon absorption, the nonlinear photon absorption is dramatically enhanced and the 

observed nonlinear absorption amplitude becomes comparable to that of the single-photon absorption in a 

two-level system. The experimental results can be interpreted in term of the two-photon absorption in the 

dressed state picture and the absorptive photon switch can therefore be viewed as a two-photon device. 

The experimental measurements agree with the theoretical calculations based on the four-level EIT system 

and provide an example of resonant nonlinear optics manifested by quantum interference under low light 

intensities.

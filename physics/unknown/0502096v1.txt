Abstract. An internal inconsistency with mutually exclusive Hamiltonians and the corresponding 

mutually exclusive states HH and H-antiH suffices to doubt the usefulness of ab initio calculations for H-

antiH based on 1927 Heitler-London theory. Removing this inconsistency in a generic way invalidates this 

theory but the compensation is that problems with antihydrogen are removed.

Claims that mass-production of H seems possible [1] boosted work on H-H interactions [2]. A 

charge-inverted Hamiltonian is needed to describe HH with ab initio procedures [2]. All these 

authors persistently overlook the generic bonding character of this charge-inverted Hamiltonian, as is 

demonstrated below. A result with a generically bonding Hamiltonian is easily predicted without 

calculation: it must, by definition, always lead to a bound 4-particle system. Since HH is considered as 

unstable [2], these methods are erratic when a charge-inverted Hamiltonian is proved attractive. 

This historical error is about the mutually exclusive character of 2 (quantum) states for HH and HH or 

their Hamiltonians. Our proof starts with the well-known non-relativistic 10 term Heitler-

London (HL) Hamiltonian for molecular hydrogen H2 (=HH) [3] abbreviated as 

H+ = H0 + ∆H  

where H0 is the collection of the 6 intra-atomic terms and ∆H of the 4 inter-atomic terms. This 

Hamiltonian is also valid for HH, since HH and HH are charge-symmetrical. HL showed that,

for molecular hydrogen HH=H2, the eigenvalues deriving from (1) are  

E = E0 ±β   

 

where E0 is the eigenvalue for atomic asymptote H+H and β the eigenvalue for the interaction, 

i.e. the resonance or exchange integral of HL-theory [3]. But with (1), β is also the eigenvalue of ∆H, 

since E0 is the eigenvalue of H0 for the asymptote. HL-result (2) explains the observed splitting of 

states (bonding and anti-bonding) in molecular hydrogen but gave an inaccurate PEC (potential 

energy curve) for the bound singlet state. Despite this, HL-theory is considered as a triumph for 

wave mechanics, since exchange forces are absent in classical physics. With (2), the 2 quantum 

states for neutral 4-particle system, molecular hydrogen, are mutually exclusive, as expected. 

For charge-asymmetrical systems HH and HH, a charge-inverted Hamiltonian H- appears [2]. 

With (1) as reference, this is given by 

H- = H0 – ∆H

the only valid Hamiltonian for studies on HH-systems [2]. As a result, all charge-symmetrical (HH 

and HH) and charge-asymmetrical systems (HH and HH) can now be described with only one 

algebraic Hamiltonian, having a built-in parity operator 

H±  = H0 ±∆H  

which, by definition, typifies Hamiltonians (1) and (3) as mutually exclusive too. This means literally that only 

one of the two Hamiltonians (1) or (3) can be bonding and lead to a stable 4-particle system, the other is doomed

to be anti-bonding and must lead to a repulsive system. The real surprise with (4) however is that it is easily 

verified, without any calculation, that its two eigenvalues must be of type 

E± = E’0 ±β’  

 

and, therefore, are at least formally identical (degenerate) with those of HL-theory (2). Only, the two eigenvalues in 

(5) separate by virtue of intra-atomic charge-inversion, whereas those of HL-theory (2) separate by virtue of lepton 

spin-inversion. Analytical details of the two approaches [4] show that, even if asymptotes E0 in (2) 

and E’0 in (5) and corresponding bond energies β and β’ were different, this has no consequences 

to decide about the generic character of Hamiltonians (1) and (3). In fact, asymptotic freedom must 

be allowed anyhow for 4-particle system molecular hydrogen [4]. 

Before deciding which option is the better to explain a chemical bond, it is easily verified that, 

because of this formal degeneracy, charge-symmetrical state HH obeying (1) and charge-

asymmetrical state HH obeying (3) are two mutually exclusive states allowed for the 4-particle quantum 

system called molecular hydrogen. Exactly this formal degeneracy of (2) and (5) leads to internal 

inconsistencies in studies like [2]. 

Choosing between the 2 formally degenerate options proves difficult, although it is known for 

long that charge- and spin-operators are identical, apart from a factor 2, which is consistent with 

the formal degeneracy of (2) and (5) also [4]. To reach a conclusion, the physics and chemistry 

community decided a long time ago to impose a rather drastic solution: the exclusion of (5) as a 

real solution by simply forbidding (5) in the natural world. 

At first sight, this is understandable, since one is indeed tempted to characterize Hamiltonian (1) 

as bonding, since in HL-theory (2) only the charge-symmetrical Hamiltonian (1) leads to the stable 

bound state for molecular hydrogen. By exclusion, this automatically would not only classify 

Hamiltonian (3) as anti-bonding but also the quantum state HH, it represents. Interpreted with 

HL-theory and using (4), HH would be always be classified as a repulsive state.  

Simple arguments prove that this drastic conclusion, i.e. forbidding (5), is wrong [4], which would 

invalidate the use of the Hamiltonian (1) of HL-theory. If so, the only generic solution possible 

through the mutually exclusive constraint, is that the bound state of molecular hydrogen is 

charge-asymmetrical HH, whereas its repulsive state is charge-symmetrical HH. This generic

solution would immediately solve problems surrounding H, as argued before [4] but at the same 

time, invalidate the Hamiltonian in HL-theory as well as in its many successors. 

For annihilation of charge-asymmetrical system HH [2] to take place at short range, either 

asymptote E0 or E’0 must be reached from the attractive side, i.e. with (3), which proves the 

repulsive nature of (1) by exclusion. This proves (3) is attractive, since repulsive systems can 

never annihilate. For molecular hydrogen, annihilation does not actually occur, since there are too 

many repulsive terms in both (1) and (3), including the kinetic energy terms [4]. 

Also, there is abundant evidence [4] that the decisive parameter to describe the total energy of 4-

particle systems (chemical bonds) is the inter-baryon separation, r(pp) in (1) and r(pp) in (3). It is 

evident that in HL Hamiltonian (1) this is repulsive +e2/r(pp), whereas it is attractive –e2/r(pp) in 

(3). Also this proves that an attractive Hamiltonian for a 4-particle system can only be a charge-inverted 

Hamiltonian (3). If this logical consequence of (4) would be denied, even the universal Coulomb 

law should be invalidated, since this states that, by definition, like charges or charge-symmetrical 

systems (++; --) or (1) always repel, while unlike charges, charge-asymmetrical or charge-

conjugated systems (+-; -+) or (3) always attract. This would indeed be the absurd result of 

denying the reality and the real meaning of (4). Therefore, HL-theory, based upon (1), clearly 

defies, contradicts and simply violates the universal character of the Coulomb law. 

Hence, the asymptote is approached from the repulsive side with (1), whereas only with (3), it is 

reached from the attractive side, which settles the problem and proves that (3) is the only 

Hamiltonian to have generic attractive character for a 4-particle system like a chemical bond. A 

byproduct of this elementary deduction is that all HL-based, i.e. all charge-symmetrical (1)-based 

quantum-chemical, procedures are affronted with computational difficulties, since they all invariantly 

try to explain a stable state using repulsive HL Hamiltonian (1). After decades of intensive quantum-

chemical research, the many computational difficulties are proved de facto. This inconsistency also 

explains (a) why, in practice, wave functions needed to invert the character of (1) from repulsive 

to attractive are unnecessarily complex and (b) why they all must have a built-in parity operator like 

in HL-theory to remedy for this inversion of (1). 

Failing to recognize the generic attractive character of (3) leads to inconsistencies. If, in reality, 

the bound state of molecular hydrogen were HH, due to (5), many problems in theoretical and 

experimental physics and chemistry on H would disappear, as argued before [5].  

Many will find it difficult to admit that Heitler and London were wrong, be it involuntarily, since, at 

the time, charge-inversion problems did not even exist. Still, one is confronted with experimental 

evidence for natural atom H [5]. To make sense, claiming the presence of a natural charge-

inverted state H in a bound state of molecular hydrogen on the basis of (5), implies that a charge-

inverted H-state or H must also show in the line spectrum of natural species hydrogen, which is 

exactly what we proved [5]. Unfortunately, none of these results is properly referenced [6], not 

even in a broad forum like a review on H [7]. 

More consequences, arguments and references in favor of this analysis, including the striking 

similarity between bonding explained with C-symmetry as in (5) and the quark model of particle 

physics are in a more elaborate paper [4].

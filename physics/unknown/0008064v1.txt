ABSTRACT

The  CLIC  study  of  a  high-energy  (0.5  -  5  TeV),
high-luminosity  (1034  -  1035  cm-2  sec-1)  eH  linear
collider  is  presented.  Beam  acceleration  using  high
frequency  (30 GHz)  normal-conducting  structures
operating  at  high  accelerating  fields  (150  MV/m)
significantly  reduces  the  length  and,  in  consequence,
the  cost  of  the  linac.  Using  parameters  derived  from
general  scaling  laws  for  linear  colliders,  the  beam
stability  is  shown  to  be  similar  to  lower  frequency
designs  in  spite  of  the  strong  wake-field  dependency
on frequency. A new cost-effective and efficient drive
beam generation scheme for RF power production by
the  so-called  "Two-Beam  Acceleration"  method  is
described. It uses a thermionic gun and a fully-loaded
normal-conducting  linac  operating  at  low  frequency
(937 MHz) to generate and accelerate the drive beam
bunches,  and  RF  multiplication  by  funnelling  in
compressor  rings 
the  desired  bunch
structure. Recent 30 GHz hardware developments and
CLIC Test Facility (CTF) results are described.

1  INTRODUCTION

The  Compact  Linear  Collider  (CLIC)  covers  a
centre-of-mass energy range for eH collisions of 0.5 - 5
TeV  [1]  with  a  maximum  energy  well  above  those
presently being proposed for any other linear collider
[2].  It  has  been  optimised  for  a  3  TeV  eH  colliding
beam energy to meet  post-LHC  physics  requirements
[3]  but  can  be  built 
in  stages  without  major
modifications.  An  overall  layout  of  the  complex  is
shown  in  Fig.1.  In  order  to  limit  the  overall  length,
high  accelerating  fields  are  mandatory  and  these  can
only  be  obtained  with  conventional  structures,  by
operating at a high frequency. The RF  power  to  feed

the  accelerating  structures  is  extracted  by  transfer
structures from high-intensity/low-energy drive beams
running  parallel  to  the  main  beam  (Fig.  2).  A  single
tunnel,  housing  both  linacs  and  the  various  beam
transfer  lines  without  any  modulators  or  klystrons,
results  in  a  very  simple,  cost  effective  and  easily
extendable configuration.

length,  vertical  beta  function  and  normalised  vertical
beam  emittance  at  the  I.P.  respectively  [4].  The
parameters  have  been  derived  from  general  scaling
laws  [4]  covering  more  than  a  decade  in  frequency.
These scaling laws, which agree with optimised linear
collider  designs,  show  that  the  beam  blow-up  during
acceleration  can  be  made  independent  of  frequency
for  equivalent  beam  trajectory  correction  techniques.
As  a  consequence,  and 
the  strong
dependence of wakefields on frequency, CLIC  whilst
operating  at  a  high  frequency  but  with  a  low  charge
per bunch N, a short bunch length 8z, strong focussing
optics  and  a  high  accelerating  gradient  G,  preserves
the vertical emittance as well as low frequency linacs.
The  RF-to-beam  transfer  efficiency  is  optimised  by
using a large number of bunches and  by  choosing  an

in  spite  of 

optimum  accelerating  section  length.  In  spite  of  the
reduced  charge  per  bunch  and  the  high  gradient,
excellent RF-to-beam efficiency  is  obtained    because
the  time  between  bunches  is  shorter  and  the  shunt
impedance of the accelerating structures is higher.

Figure 3: Luminosity distribution with energy.

(L0: total integrated luminosity, E0: max. energy)

Up to 1 TeV, where the beamstrahlung parameter
& <1, the beam parameters are chosen to have a small
/B. To limit the power consumption above 1 TeV, 0ny
is  reduced  and &  allowed  to  be  >>1.  In  this  regime
(see Eq.1), high frequency linacs are very favourable
because 8z  is  small.  As  a  consequence,  even  with &
>>1, neither the L spectrum (Fig. 3), nor the  number
of emitted gammas which increase the background in
the detector,  significantly  deteriorate  with  energy  [1]
(see  Table  1).  The  number  of  eH  pairs  generated  per
crossing however increases significantly with energy.

3  MAIN LINAC

The effects of the strong 30 GHz wakefields (WT)
can  be  kept  moderate  by  choosing  N  to  be  small
(4√ó109 at all energies) and 8z at the lower limit that is
permitted  by  the  momentum  acceptance  of  the  final
focus. With a high gradient G and strong focusing, the
single-bunch blow-up 0ny can be kept below 100 
at all energies (Fig. 4) [5].

injected  0ny  of  5√ó10-9  rad.m 

To obtain the values of L given in Table 1 a very
small 
is  assumed.
Limiting  the  overall 0ny  relies  in  part  on  the  use  of
bumps  which  are  created  locally  at  5-10  positions
along  the  linac  by  mis-aligning  a  few  upstream
cavities.  The  effects  of  these  bumps  are  used  to
minimise  the  local 0ny  (Fig.4).  Without  these  bumps,
dispersive  effects  are   10  times  weaker  than  WT
effects. The average lattice --function starts from  4-
5  m  and  is  scaled  approx.  as  (energy)0.5.  The  FODO
lattice  is  made  up  of  sectors  with  equi-spaced
quadrupoles of  equal  length  and  normalised  strength,
with  matching  insertions  between  sectors.  The  RF
cavities  and  quadrupoles  are  pre-aligned  to  10  and
50 2m respectively using a stretched-wire positioning
system.  The  misalignments  of  the  beam  position
monitors  (BPMs)  are  measured  as  follows  [6].  A
section of 12 quadrupoles is switched off, and with the
beam centred in the two end BPMs of this section, the
relative  mis-alignment  of  the  other  monitors  are
measured  with  an  accuracy  of  0.12m.  The  beam
trajectory and ground motion effects are corrected by
a  1-to-1  correction.  BNS  damping  is  achieved  by
running  off  the  RF-crest  by  6o  to  10o.  Multiple
bunches are required to obtain high luminosities. The
multi-bunch  emittance  blow-up  0ny  is    20%.  To
make  the  154-bunch  train  stable  requires  a  strong
reduction of the transverse wakefields induced by the
beam  in  the  accelerating  structures.  A  new  Tapered
Damped Structure (TDS) [7] has been designed. Each
of the 150 cells is damped by its own set of four radial

waveguides  (Fig.  5)  giving  a  Q  of  16  for  the  lowest
dipole  mode.  A  simple  linear  tapering  of  the  iris
dimension provides a de-tuning frequency spread of 2
GHz  (5.4%).  The  waveguides  are  terminated  with
short silicon carbide loads [8].

4  THE RF POWER SOURCE

The  overall  layout  of  the  CLIC  RF  power  source
scheme for a 3 TeV centre-of-mass collider is  shown
in Fig. 7. The RF power for each 624 m section of the
main  linac  is  provided  by  a  secondary  low-energy
high-intensity electron beam which runs parallel to the
main  linac.  The  power  is  generated  by  passing  this
electron beam through energy-extracting RF structures
in the so-called ‚ÄúDrive Beam Decelerator‚Äù.

For  the  3  TeV  c.m.  collider  there  are  44  drive
beams (22 per linac). Each drive beam has an energy
of  1.18  GeV  and  consists  of  1952  bunches  with  a
spacing of 2 cm and a maximum charge per bunch of
16  nC.  These  22  drive  beams,  spaced  at  intervals  of
1248 m, are produced as one long pulse by one of the
two  drive  beam  generators.  By  initially  sending  this
drive beam train in the opposite direction to the main
beam, different time slices of the pulse can be used to
power separate sections of the main linac.

Figure 5: A cut-away view of the CLIC TDS

Calculations  of  the  transverse  wakefields  in  this
structure  indicate  a  short-range  level  of  about  1000
V/(pCbmmbm)  decreasing  to  less  than  1  %  at  the
second bunch and with a long-time level below 0.1 %.

Figure 6 : Comparison of measured ASSET

wakefield levels and theory.

A  15  GHz  scale  model  of  this  structure  has  been
tested  in  the  ASSET  Test  Facility  at  SLAC.  The
measured  wakefield  levels  shown  in  Fig.  6  are  in
excellent  agreement  with  the  theoretical  predictions
[9]. The 7.6 GHz signal at the 1% level is not related
to the structure but to a beam-pipe/structure transition.
The recent observation of surface damage at relatively
low accelerating gradients (~65 MV/m) and with short
pulses (16 ns) in these  high  group  velocity  structures
is  a  cause  of  concern.  It  is  not  clear  at  the  moment
whether this can be attributed to  the  geometry  of  the
structure  or  to  other  contributing  factors  such  as
vacuum level or conditioning procedure.

The  drive  beam  is  generated  as  follows  [10].  All
the  bunches  (for  22  drive  beams)  are  first  generated
and accelerated with a spacing of 64  cm  as  one  long
continuous  train  in  a  normal-conducting  fully-loaded
937 MHz linac  operating  at  a  gradient  of  3.9  MV/m.
This 7.5 A 92 2s continuous beam can be accelerated
with an RF/beam efficiency  97%. After acceleration
the continuous train of 42944 bunches is split up into
352 trains of 122 bunches using  the  combined  action
of a delay line and a grouping of bunches in odd and
even RF buckets. These trains are then combined in a
78  m  circumference  ring  by 
four
successive  bunch  trains  over  four  turns  to  obtain  a
distance  between  bunches  at  this  stage  of  8 cm.  A
second  combination  using 
is
subsequently  made 
larger  312  m
circumference ring, yielding a final  distance  between
bunches  of  2  cm.  The  power-extracting  structures
consist  of 
rectangular
waveguides coupled to a circular beam pipe. Each 80
cm  long  structure  provides  458  MW  of  30  GHz  RF
power, enough to feed two accelerating structures. For
stability in the drive beam decelerator, these structures

four  periodically-loaded 

interleaving 

the  same  method 

in  a  similar, 

have  to  be  damped  to  reduce  long-range  transverse
wakefield effects.

Two  drive-beam  accelerator  options  are  presently
being  studied:  to  use  re-circulation  to  reduce  the
installed RF power, and to use a single accelerator to
produce the drive beams for both the e- and e+ linacs.

5 MAIN BEAM INJECTORS
is 

The  main  beam  injector  complex 

located
centrally  (see  Fig.1).  To  reduce  cost  the  same  linacs
accelerate both electrons and positrons on consecutive
RF  pulses.  The  positrons  are  produced  by  standard
technology  already  in  use  at  the  SLC  (SLAC  Linear
Collider)  but  with  improved  performance  due  to  the
larger  acceptance  of  the  L-band  capture  linac  [11].
The  electron  and  positron  beams  are  damped
transversely  in  specially  designed  damping  rings  for
low emittances [12]. The damping rings are made up
of  arcs  based  on  a  Theoretical  Minimum  Emittance
(TME)  lattice  and  straight  sections  equipped  with
wigglers.  The  positrons  are  pre-damped  in  a  pre-
damping ring. A specific design for a 3  TeV  collider
is underway but has not yet been completed. The aim
is  to  provide  normalised  emittances  of  5√ó10-7  and
5√ó10-9  rad.m.  in  the  horizontal  and  vertical  planes
respectively,  at  the  entrance  to  the  main  linac.  The
bunches  are  compressed  in  two  stages  in  magnetic
chicanes  [13],  the  first  one  after  the  damping  ring
using  3  GHz  structures,  the  second  one  just  before
injection into the main linac with 30 GHz structures.

An option to use a common injector linac for both

main beams and drive beams is being studied.

6  THE BEAM DELIVERY AND

INTERACTION POINT

to  suppress 

Studies of the beam delivery section consisting of
a  final-focus  chromatic  correction  section  and  a
collimation  section  for  the  3  TeV  collider  have  only
just started and for the moment there is no consistent
design.  A  large  crossing  angle  (20  mrad  total)  is
required  [14] 
the  multi-bunch  kink
instability  created  by  parasitic  collisions  away  from
the  main  interaction  point  (IP).  This  however  means
that  crab-cavities  will  have  to  be  used  to  avoid  a
reduction  in  luminosity.  Although  the  final-focus
design  is  at  a  very  preliminary  stage,  an  optics  has
been found (see Fig.8) which looks promising [15]. It
consists  of  horizontal  and  vertical  chromatic
correction  sections  followed  by  a  final  transformer.
80% of the ideal luminosity is obtained for a 1% full-
width  flat  energy  spread  of  the  beams.  The  rms  spot
sizes in both planes are  20-30%  larger  than  expected
from the simple  calculation  using    the  emittance  and
the beta function at the IP. Peak beta functions reach
1000  km.  The  length  per  side  is  3.1  km.  The  design
allocation  for  the  total  beam  delivery  section  (final
focus plus collimation) is 2K5 km.

Figure 8: Final focus optics for a 3 TeV collider.

The feasibility of maintaining 1 nm beam sizes in
collision  in  the  presence  of  ground  movement  and
component  jitter  has  to  be  investigated.  The  use  of
position feedback systems within the 130 ns pulse are
being considered [16].

The  consequences  of  the  large  mean  energy  loss
(31%) and energy spread (100%) which are produced
by the very strong beam-beam forces at the IP in the
vertical plane (even when the beams  miss  each  other
by 10-208) must be carefully studied. Extraction of a
spent beam with 100% energy spread and with a large
beam divergence is a concern and will make bending
and 
loss  particularly
challenging.

focussing  without  beam 

The  total  energy  carried  by  the  6.8√ó108  coherent
pairs at 3  TeV  is  about  40  Joules,  and  extracting  the
particles without producing losses in the detector will
be a challenge. Background levels in the detector may
also dramatically increase due to their sheer number.

7  TEST FACILITIES

The first CLIC Test Facility (CTF1) operated from
1990  to  1995  and  demonstrated  the  feasibility  of
two-beam power generation. 76 MW of 30 GHz peak
power was extracted from a low-energy high-intensity
beam and this power was used to generate a gradient
in the 30 GHz structure of  94 MV/m for 12 ns.

A  second  test  facility  (CTF2)  [17]  is  now  being
operated. The 30 GHz part of this facility is equipped
with 
active-alignment
system.  The  48-bunch  450  nC  drive  beam  train  is
generated  by  a  laser-driven  S-band  RF  gun  with  a
Cs2Te  photo-cathode.  The  beam  is  accelerated  to
40 MeV by two travelling-wave sections  operating at
slightly different frequencies to provide beam loading

two)  with  16  ns  long  pulses.  The  single  probe  beam

photo-cathode.  It  is  pre-accelerated  to  50  MeV  at  S-
band  before  being 
the  30  GHz
accelerating  linac.  The  drive  beam  RF  gun  has
produced  a  single  bunch  of  112  nC  and  a  maximum
charge  of  755  nC  in  48  bunches.  The  maximum
charge  transmitted  through  the  30  GHz  modules  was
450 nC. A series of cross-checks between drive beam
charge,  generated  RF  power,  and  main  beam  energy
gain have shown excellent agreement. The maximum
RF  power  generated  by  one  0.5  m  structure  was
27 MW.  The  highest  average  accelerating  gradient
was  59 MV/m  and  the  energy  of  an  0.7 nC  probe
beam  has  been  increased  by  55  MeV.  Unexpected
surface  damage  was  found  at  these  field  levels  and
further studies are needed to find the cause. The tests
were made under particularly  bad  vacuum  conditions
which for the moment makes vacuum a prime suspect.
Extremely  high  gradients  were  obtained  [18]  by
powering  a  30 GHz  single-cell 
resonant  cavity
directly  by  the  drive  beam.  The  cavity  operated
without breakdown at a peak accelerating gradient of
290 MV/m. When pushed further, the cavity started to
breakdown  at  surface-field  levels  around  500 MV/m.
The breakdown  manifested  itself  as  a  field  extinction
of the decaying pulse at different times in the pulse. At
the end of the test when the cavity was breaking down
continuously,  surface 
levels  as  high  as
750 MV/m were obtained.

A  new  facility  (CTF3  ‚Äì  see  Fig.9)  is  under  study
[19] in collaboration with LAL (France),  LNF  (Italy)
and SLAC (USA), which would test all major parts of
the  CLIC  RF  power  scheme.  To  reduce  cost,  it  is
based  on  the  use  of  3  GHz  klystrons  and  modulators
recuperated from the LEP Injector Linac (LIL).

give  a  peak  power  at  each  structure  of  69  MW.  The
beam pulse is 1.4 2s long with an average current  of

3.5 A. The bunches are initially spaced by 20 cm (two
3  GHz  buckets)  but  after  two  stages  of  frequency
multiplication they have a final spacing of 2 cm. This
bunch  train,  with  a  maximum  charge  of  2.3  nC  per
bunch, is then decelerated by four 0.8 m long transfer
structures in the 30 GHz drive beam decelerator from

8  CONCLUSION

The CLIC Two-Beam scheme is an ideal candidate
for  extending  the  energy  reach  of  a  future  high-
luminosity linear collider from  0.5  TeV  up  to  5  TeV
c.m.  The  high  operating  frequency  (30  GHz)  should
allow  the  use  of  high  accelerating  gradients  (150
MV/m) which shorten the linacs (27.5 km for 3 TeV)
and  reduce  the  cost.  This  level  of  gradient  however
has yet to be demonstrated, and the recent unexpected
structure damage at much lower field levels is a cause
for  concern.  The  effects  of  the  high  transverse
wakefields  have  been  compensated  by  a  judicious
choice of bunch length, charge and focusing strength,
such that the emittance blow-up is made independent
of  the  frequency  of  the  accelerating  system  for
equivalent beam trajectory correction techniques. The
two-beam  RF  power  source  based  on  a  fully-loaded
normal-conducting low-frequency linac and frequency
multiplication in  combiner  rings  is  an  efficient,  cost-
effective  and  flexible  way  of  producing  30  GHz
power. The feasibility of two-beam power production
has  been  demonstrated  in  the  CLIC  Test  Facilities
(CTF1 and CTF2). A third test facility is being studied
to  demonstrate 
the  newly-proposed  drive  beam
generation and frequency multiplication schemes.

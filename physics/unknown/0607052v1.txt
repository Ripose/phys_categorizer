We demonstrate the dynamics of stimulated Raman scattering in designed high-Q/Vm 

silicon photonic band gap nanocavities through the coupled-mode theory framework 

towards optically-pumped silicon lasing. The interplay of other χ(3) effects such as two-

photon absorption and optical Kerr, related free-carrier dynamics, thermal effects, as well 

as linear losses such as cavity radiation and linear material absorption are included and 

investigated numerically. Our results clarify the relative contributions and evolution of 

the mechanisms, and demonstrate the lasing and shutdown thresholds. Our studies 

illustrate the conditions for continuous-wave and pulsed highly-efficient Raman 

frequency conversion to be practically realized in monolithic silicon high-Q/Vm photonic 

band gap defect cavities.

1. Introduction 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

Silicon is increasingly being considered as the dominant platform for photonic integrated 

circuits, providing the advantages of dense CMOS electronics integration, transparency in 

the telecommunication C-band, as well as high-index contrast for compact integrated 

optical functionalities. Passive silicon photonic devices have already recently reported 

remarkable progress [1-4]. With strong modal confinement, nonlinear optical properties 

in silicon are enhanced and active functionalities in highly integrated silicon devices have 

been realized, such as all-optical switches [5], and all-silicon Raman amplification and 

lasing [6-14].  

 

Photonic crystals (PhC), with periodic modulation in the index of refraction, permit 

unique opportunities in specific studies and applications [15, 16]. Two-dimensional (2D) 

PhC slabs confine light by Bragg reflection in-plane and total internal reflection in the 

third dimension. Introduction of point and line defects into 2D PhC slabs create 

nanocavities and PhC waveguides with arbitrary dispersion control that can be designed 

from first principles. Such defect cavities have subwavelength modal volumes, on order 

0.02(λ/n)3, corresponding to high field intensities per photon for increased nonlinear 

interaction. Through k-space design of cavity modes [17, 18], recently cavities with 

remarkable high quality factors (Q) [1, 2, 19-22] have been achieved, permitting for long 

photon lifetimes for light-matter interactions. The strong optical confinement and photon 

lifetimes in these cavities permit fundamental studies and integrated nanophotonics 

applications [23], such as channel add/drop filters [24], low-threshold quantum well 

lasers [25], cavity quantum electrodynamics [26], enhancement of optical nonlinearities 

[27], and ultrasmall nonlinear bistable devices [28, 29]. 

 

 

Raman scattering in silica-based high-Q microcavities, such as microspheres [30], 

microdisks and microtoroids [31], have shown remarkable ultra-low lasing thresholds. In 

addition, Raman lasing in silicon waveguides has also been observed [6-14] where the 

bulk Raman gain coefficient gR is 103 to 104 times larger in silicon than in silica and two-

photon absorption induced free-carrier absorption [32] addressed by pulsed or reversed 

biased p-i-n diode operation. To achieve significant amplification and ultimately lasing, 

the gain medium should be placed in a cavity with sufficiently high-Q, and ultrasmall 

modal volumes Vm. The enhanced stimulated Raman amplification and ultralow threshold 

Raman lasing in high-Q/Vm photonic band gap nanocavities was suggested [33]. 

Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in periodic crystals with slow group velocity was 

theoretically studied with a semiclassical model [34], and enhancement in line-defect 

photonic crystal slow-light waveguides was also proposed [35].  

Here we employ a coupled-mode theory framework to study the various contributions on 

Raman scattering and lasing [36, 37]. Coupled-mode equations are widely used in passive 

photonic devices such as optical waveguide direction couplers, channel add-drop filters 

[38, 39] and also in the analysis of optical nonlinearities [28, 40-42]. The coupled-mode 

equations for stimulated Raman scattering in silicon-on-insulator waveguides [9, 43-45], 

fiber Bragg grating [46] and silica microsphere [47, 48] have been studied. Following 

from the work of Ref [28, 40, 42], we derive, in this present paper, the coupled-mode 

equations for stimulated Raman scattering in high-Q/Vm silicon photonic band gap 

nanocavities. The dynamics of coupling between the pump cavity mode and the Stokes 

cavity mode is explored in the presence of cavity radiation losses, linear material 

absorption, two-photon absorption, and free-carrier absorption. The refractive index shift 

from the Kerr effect, free-carrier dispersion, and thermal dispersion are also considered in 

the coupled-mode equations. These equations can be numerically integrated to describe 

the dynamical behavior of the system for the designed L5 photonic band gap 

nanocavities. Specific examples such as lasing threshold, both pump and Stokes seed in 

continuous wave (CW) operation, pulsed pump with CW Stokes seed, on-off gain (loss), 

and the interaction of pump pulse and Stokes pulse are investigated in detail. 

 

 

2. Design concept and coupled-mode theory 

Stimulated Raman scattering is an inelastic two-photon process, where an incident photon 

interacts with an excited state of the material (the LO and TO phonons of single-crystal 

silicon). The strongest Stokes peak arises from single first-order Raman phonon (three-

fold degenerate) at the Brillouin zone center. We have proposed a photonic band gap 

cavity with five linearly aligned missing air holes (L5) in an air-bridge triangular lattice 

photonic crystal slab with thickness of 0.6a and the radius of air holes is 0.29a, where the 

lattice period a = 420 nm [33]. The designed cavity supports two even modes, pump 

mode and Stokes mode, with spacing 15.6 THz, corresponding to the optical phonon 

frequency in monolithic silicon. Figure 1 shows the scanning electron micrograph (SEM) 

of the designed and fabricated L5 cavity coupled with photonic crystal waveguide. Figure 

2(a) and 2(b) show the electric field profile (Ey) at the middle of the slab for pump mode 

and Stokes mode calculated from 3D FDTD method. 

 

 

Coupling between pump mode and Stokes mode in SRS can be understood classically 

with nonlinear polarizations

NLP . The dynamics of SRS is governed through a set of time-

dependent coupled nonlinear equations (in MKS) [49],

suggests the motivation for small VR cavities with high-Q factors.

fcτ  is the effective free-carrier lifetime accounting for both recombination and diffusion. 

Time constants of radiative and Auger recombination, as well as from bulk defects and 

impurities, are assumed to be significantly slower than the free-carrier recombination and 

diffusion lifetime [50]. We note that while free-carrier lifetime can vary with carrier 

density and carrier density can vary spatially with intensity in the cavity, an effective 

lifetime is used here for simplicity. A quiescent carrier density of N0 = 1022 m-3 is used in 

the initial condition for silicon. 

 

In equations (23) and (24), 

iω∆  is the detuning of the resonance frequency of the cavity 

from the input light frequency due to the Kerr effect, free-carrier dispersion (FCD), and 

thermal dispersion.

Equations (23-25), (31), (36), and (42) therefore describe the dynamic behavior of SRS in 

photonic crystal nanocavities, and is numerically integrated in our work to describe the 

dynamical behavior of pump-Stokes interactions in our L5 photonic crystal cavity system 

that supports the desired two-mode frequencies at the appropriate LO/TO phonon 

spacing. 

3. Numerical analysis 

3.1 Lasing threshold

gain equals the losses, and the Stokes mode energy

Figure 3 shows the threshold pump mode energy 

 as a function of QS for different 

2

thpa

free-carrier lifetimes 

fcτ . All the parameters used in calculation are presented in Table 1. 

By comparing the curve in the absence of TPA and FCA (

0=Siβ

) and the curve with 

TPA but without FCA (

0=fcτ

), it is observed that TPA increases the threshold pump 

mode energy but the effect of TPA is relatively weak. The effect of TPA-induced FCA is 

much more dramatic as shown for different free-carrier lifetimes fcτ . The lasing threshold 

increases when 

fcτ  is larger. There is a minimum Stokes QS required for lasing, as seen in 

the solutions plotted in Figure 3. If QS is lower than a critical value for certain 

fcτ , there 

is no solution numerically and physically this translates to an absence of a lasing 

threshold regardless of the pump intensity. For increasing 

fcτ , the critical value of QS 

increases monotonically as can be seen in Figure 3. The solid and dotted curves show the 

lasing and shutdown thresholds, respectively [44]. The shutdown threshold is the pump 

power in which the lasing output power returns to zero due to increasing TPA and FCA. 

For the L5 cavity studied in the present paper, QS = 21,000, the maximum 

fcτ  is around 

0.175 ns, and the threshold pump mode energy is 29 fJ. For air-bridged silicon photonic 

band gap nanocavities, 

fcτ = 0.5 ns [42], which is much higher than the maximum fcτ . In 

order to get lasing for this cavity, instead of using CW pump signal, pulse pump signal 

can be used to reduce the TPA-induced FCA for loss reduction. 

 

We now solve for the input-output characteristics of photonic band gap defect cavity 

laser by considering equation (24) in steady state. Figure 4 shows the laser input-output 

characteristics with different free-carrier lifetimes fcτ . QS = 30,000 and QS = 60,000 are 

considered for comparison. Cavities with higher QS have higher output Stokes signals, 

lower lasing threshold pump mode energies and higher shutdown thresholds. The 

required corresponding pump power in the input waveguide can also be calculated based 

on equation (23) in steady state. 

 

 

 

 

3.2 Lasing dynamics 

We now consider the dynamics of the Raman lasing interactions. Equations (23-25), (31), 

(36), and (42) are numerically integrated with a variable order Adams-Bashforth-Moulton 

predictor-corrector method (Matlab® ode113 solver). All the parameters used in 

calculation are presented in Table 1. 

Figure 5 shows the dynamics of Raman amplification with 60 mW CW pump wave and 

10 µW CW Stokes seed signal, free carrier lifetime is 0.5 ns. In the beginning when free 

carrier density is low, Raman gain is greater than loss and there is amplification. When 

free carrier density increases, FCA dominates the loss and Stokes signal is suppressed. 

The temperature difference then increases significantly. The cavity resonance is red 

shifted and the pump mode energy goes down. From the numerical results, the Kerr effect 

is predominantly weak. The FCD effect dominates at first when the temperature 

difference is low, with a resulting blue shift. Eventually thermal effect dominates, with a 

resulting red shift. Consider the case of a different carrier lifetime at 0.1 ns. Figure 6 

shows the calculated results with free carrier lifetime of 0.1 ns. With lower free carrier 

lifetime, the free carrier density and the temperature difference are lower, so that the net 

Raman gain is greater than zero. The oscillation of Stokes mode energy near t = 0.5 ns is 

due to the dispersion induced Stokes resonance frequency shift.  

In order to get lasing from this cavity, instead of using CW pump signal, pulse pump 

signal with pulse width narrower than the free carrier lifetime is used to reduce the TPA-

induced FCA, so as to reduce loss and increase net gain. Figure 7 shows the dynamics of 

Raman amplification with pump pulse of 60 mW peak power, pulse width TFWHM = 50 ps 

and 10 µW CW Stokes signal. The free carrier density and the temperature difference are 

significantly reduced, and a strong Stokes pulse is generated by the pump pulse. The 

resonance frequency shift is also significantly reduced by the pump pulse operation. 

 

 

Consider now the case of on-off gain and loss in our cavity system, where the probe 

signal changes between the pump pulse on and off when the probe frequency is on- (off-) 

resonance with the Stokes frequency [9]. Pulsed pump beam with 60 mW peak power 

and TFWHM = 50 ps, and CW probe beam with 1 mW power are used. Figure 8 shows the 

on-off gain and on-off loss. When the probe is on the Stokes frequency, an increase in the 

probe signal due to the SRS is observed, and the on-off gain is around 8 dB. When the 

probe frequency is detuned from the Stokes frequency (no Raman gain), the loss in the 

probe signal due to the pump pulse generated free carriers is observed, and the on-off loss 

is around 20 dB. Figures 9 and 10 show the dynamics of the system. 

We also consider the interaction of both pump and Stokes pulses with comparable peak 

power, with numerical results shown in Figure 11. Pump peak power is 60 mW and 

Stokes peak power is 20 mW. Both pump pulse and Stokes pulse have TFWHM = 50 ps. 

The Stokes pulse is amplified by the pump pulse. Due to the high free carrier density 

induced FCD effect and high QS, there is an observed oscillation in the amplified Stokes 

 

 

 

 

pulse. 

4. Conclusions 

In this work we have derived the coupled-mode equations for stimulated Raman 

scattering in high-Q/Vm silicon photonic band gap nanocavities towards optically-pumped 

silicon lasing. Both the lasing threshold and the lasing dynamics are numerically studied 

in the presence of cavity radiation losses, linear material absorption, two-photon 

absorption, and free-carrier absorption, together with the refractive index shift from the 

Kerr effect, free-carrier dispersion, and thermal dispersion. With increasing the cavity Q 

factors and decreasing the free carrier lifetimes, the reduction in the threshold pump 

energy is solved numerically, considering all mechanisms and realistic conditions. With 

CW pump operation, the Stokes signal is suppressed due to strong TPA-induced FCA. 

With pulse pump operation, the TPA-induced FCA is significantly reduced and Stokes 

net gain increases, which shows that compact Raman amplifiers and lasers based on high-

Q/Vm silicon photonic band gap nanocavities are feasible.

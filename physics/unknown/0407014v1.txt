The present paper demonstrates the feasibility of X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy 
(XAS)  and  X-ray  Magnetic  Circular  Dichroism  (XMCD)  at  high  pressure  at  the  Fe-K 
edge on the ID24 energy dispersive beamline of the ESRF.  

In  3d  transition  metals, performing experiments at the hard X-ray K-edge rather 
than at the magnetically interesting soft X-ray L-edges represents, the only way to access 
the high pressure regime obtainable with Diamond Anvil Cells.  

The  simultaneous  availability  of  a  local  structure  (XAS)  and  of  a  magnetic 
(XMCD)  probe  on  the  sample  in  identical  thermodynamical  conditions  is  essential  to 
study correlations between local structural and magnetic properties.  

We  briefly  summarize  the  state  of  the  art  theoretical  understanding  of  K-edge 
XMCD  data,  then  illustrate  the  setup  of  beamline  ID24  for  high  pressure  XMCD 
experiments  and  underline  the  conditions  required  to  perform  measurements  at  the  K-
edges of 3d transition metals. Finally, we present two examples of recent high pressure 
results at the Fe-K edge in pure Fe and Fe3O4 powder. 
 
Keywords:  X-ray  magnetic  circular  dichroism,  high  pressure,  X-ray  absorption 
spectroscopy, energy dispersive optics. 
 
 
1. Introduction 

XMCD  is  the  difference  between  X-ray  absorption  spectra  obtained  with  right 
handed and left handed circular polarization respectively. For a finite XMCD signal to be 
measured  in  specific  temperature-pressure  conditions,  the  sample  must  present  a  net 
ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic moment. The XMCD signal is then directly proportional 
to  the  magnetic  moment  on  the  absorber  atom.  Thanks  to  its  element  and  orbital 
selectivity,  XMCD  has  been  widely  used  as  a  very  useful  probe  of  magnetic  properties 
(for a recent review e.g. Stöhr (1999) or Magnetism and Synchrotron Radiation, 2001). In 
the hard X-ray regime, thanks to the higher penetration depth of the photons, it has the 
additional  advantages  of  being  bulk  sensitive  and  applicable  to  systems  subject  to  high 
pressure in Diamond Anvil Cells. In addition to the sensitivity to the magnetic moment of 
the  dichroic  signal,  the  associated  average  XAS  spectrum  contains  information  on  the 
electronic and local structure. Thus, an XMCD experiment gives access to simultaneous 
information  on  the  magnetic  moment  around  the  absorber  atom,  as  well  as  its  local

structural  and  electronic  properties  i.e.  on  the  sample  with  the  same  thermodynamical 
conditions.  This  is  very  important  in  the  high-pressure  domain  where  non  hydrostatic 
components of the stresses can not be reproduced. These experiments open therefore the 
way to studies of correlations between structural and magnetic degrees of freedom. 
 
The  principal  techniques  available  to  study  magnetic  properties  under  high, 
pressure  are:  i)  susceptibility  measurements  by  the  inductance  method,  ii)  neutron 
diffraction, iii) Mössbauer spectroscopy and iv) inelastic x-ray scattering. 
Measurements  of  susceptibility  in  large  volume  pressure  cells,  where  the  whole 
measuring  unit  is  placed  inside  the  pressurized  volume,  are  common  but  limited  in 
pressure.  Measurements  in  a  DAC  are  more  difficult  because  of  the  impossibility  of 
placing  coils  within  the  pressurized  volume.  Nevertheless  many  coil  arrangements  in 
DACs  exist  (Eremets,  1996).  Pressures  up  to  15  GPa  (Cornelius  et  al.,  1996)  and 
temperatures of 30mK have been reported (Webb et al., 1976). 
Neutron  diffraction  is  very  sensitive  to  the  magnetic  order  (Goncharenko  &  Mirebeau, 
1998),  but  the  determination  of  the  magnetic  moment  variations  remains  limited  in 
precision  (Link  et  al.,  1998).  Although  most  published  work  is  reported  for  pressures 
below 20 GPa, recent studies up to 50 GPa in a DAC at liquid He temperature have been 
performed (Goncharenko & Mirebeau, 1997). 
Mössbauer spectroscopy with nuclear forward scattering of synchrotron radiation is also 
used to observe pressure-induced magnetic hyperfine interactions (Nasu, 1998). Pressure 
limits  are  between  40  and  100  GPa,  depending  on  the  radioactive  sources,  with  the 
exception of 200 GPa for 57Fe. Synchrotron sources will probably allow measurements at 
pressures  above  100  GPa.  The  main  problem  of  Mössbauer  spectroscopy  is  the  small 
number of Mössbauer isotopes, which excludes a large number of magnetic materials. 
Inelastic x-ray scattering is a very recent and  powerful technique  enabled  by the use of 
third  generation  synchrotron  radiation  sources,  which  opens  the  way  to  studies  on  any 
magnetic  element  in  any  magnetic  order.  This  is  a  great  advantage  compared  to 
Mössbauer  spectroscopy  and  XMCD.  Nevertheless  this  technique  is  very  difficult  to 
handle under pressure. 
 
Compared to these techniques XMCD takes advantage of its element and orbital 
selectivity, its sensitivity in the detection of very small magnetic moments (0.01 m B) and 
its intrinsic information content on local structural and electronic properties through the 
XAS signal. 

Measuring  XMCD  at  the  K-edges  of  3d  transition  metal  elements  on  samples 
subject to high pressure is a very challenging experiment. In the first place, because the 
signal is much weaker than at the LII-III edges, since we are not probing the magnetically 
interesting  localized  3d  orbitals  but  the  extended  4p  bands,  the  magnetism  of  which  is 
due  merely  to  the  spin-orbit  coupling  in  the  final  state.  In  fact,  K-edge  signals  are 
typically of the order of 10-3 (or less) in saturation conditions. Secondly, best results for 
high  pressure  XAS  are  obtained  in  the  transmission  geometry,  where  the  X-ray  beam 
passes through the highly absorbing diamonds of the high pressure cell. The transmission 
of the X-ray beam at the Fe-K edge (7100 eV) through a pair of 1.2 mm thick diamonds 
is lower than 0.4 % and falls below 0.07 % at 6.5 keV. Moreover, to generate circularly 
polarized  X-rays  from  the  linearly  polarized  X-ray  beam  provided  by  the  two  planar 
undulators  installed  on  the  straight  section  of  ID24,  we  use  a  0.7  mm  thick  diamond 
quarter  wave  plate,  that  introduces  additional  absorption  at  low  energies.  Last  but  not

least, to reach high pressures of 20-100 GPa, the anvil culets must not exceed diameters 
of 450 to 150 m m. The gasket hole diameter is approximately 1/3 of this value, and the 
sample size is therefore limited to about 100 – 50 m m or below. 

Despite  all  these  difficulties  it  is  of  great  interest  to  be  able  to  perform  high 
pressure XMCD measurements in the low energy hard X-ray range since this represents 
the  only  way  to  have  access  to  this  information,  in  the  pressure  range  covered  by  the 
DAC, on 3d transition metals. This energy range also covers a large part of the L-edges 
of rare earths. Advantages in the use of hard X-rays (K-edges rather than L-edges for 3d 
metals,  L-edges  rather  than  M-edges  for  rare  earths)  are  also  to  be  attributed  to  their 
higher bulk sensitivity.  

In the next section we give a short description of the XMCD process at K-edge of 
3d transition metal elements and highlight the importance of such measurements at high 
pressure, and in particular when, in combination with XAS spectra, correlation between 
structural  and  magnetic  properties  is  possible.  In  section  3,  we  briefly  describe  the 
experimental layout for XMCD experiments on beamline ID24. Finally, in section 4, we 
report  a  few  recent  high  pressure  XMCD  results  obtained  at  the  Fe-K  edge  of  pure  Fe, 
and on the Fe3O4 compound.  
 
2. K-edge XMCD on 3d transition metals  
 

The  interpretation  of  the  XMCD  signal  at  the  L  edges  of  transition  metals  has 
been clarified by much theoretical work (Thole et al., 1992), (Altarelli, 1993), (Carra et 
al.,  1993),  (Ankudinov  &  Rehr,  1995).  Using  the  sum-rules  it  is  possible  to  derive  the 
amplitude of both the spin and the orbital magnetic moments from a measurement of the 
XMCD  signal  at  the  L2  and  L3  edges.  Unfortunately  the  interpretation  of  the  XMCD 
signal at the K-edge of transition metals is far from being unanimously agreed upon and 
no  such  theory  as  that  mentioned  above  for  the  L  edges  is  available.  Three  different 
theoretical  approaches  can  be  found  in  the  literature:  i)  a  full  relativistic  multiple-
scattering approach (Ebert et al., 1988), (Guo, 1996), (Guo, 1997), (Ankudinov & Rehr, 
1997),  ii)  multiple  scattering  theory  with  a  non-relativistic  description  of  the  electrons 
(Brouder  &  Hikam,  1991)  and  iii)  band  structure  calculations  using  a  tight  binding 
approximation (Igarashi & Hirai, 1994), (Igarashi & Hirai, 1996). But up to now, there is 
still a lack of a theoretical description able to fully describe the experimental data. It is 
also for this reason that good quality XMCD data at high pressure will be of fundamental 
input to help improve theory for the basic understanding of the process. 

The  reasons  underlying  the  different  treatments  of  K-edge  data  are  related  to 
several factors: the spherical symmetry of the initial state (no spin-orbit coupling in the 
initial state), the fact that the process does not directly involve the 3d band, responsible 
for  magnetism  in  3d  metals,  and  because  of  the  itinerant  character  of  the  magnetism  in 
these  systems.  There  is  a  general  agreement  that  the  spin-orbit  interaction  in  the  final 
state (p band) is responsible for the formation of the XMCD signal at the K-edge in 3d 
transition  metals.  This  interaction  is  very  weak,  since  it  is  directly  proportional  to  the 
orbital kinetic moment <Lz>, generally considered to be zero because of the quenching of 
the crystal field in 3d metals. In reality this orbital moment does give a weak contribution 
to the magnetic moment. In pure 3d transition metals its values are: 0.09 m B for Fe, 0.15 

 

3

m B for Co and 0.07 m B for Ni. This explains why the XMCD signal at the K-edge is about 
100 times weaker than at the L2, 3-edges in these systems. 

To summarize, it is therefore difficult to extract absolute quantitative information 
from the XMCD signals at the K-edges in transition metals. Nevertheless, the importance 
in carrying out such experiments at ambient pressure has already been established in the 
past (Pizzini et al., 1995), (Sakurai et al., 2000). In these works, valuable information on 
the  spin  orientation  in  the  p  band  or  on  the  variation  of  the  element  specific  magnetic 
moment  with  temperature  or  with  its  concentration  was  obtained.  The  interest  in 
extending  this  technique  to  high  pressures  is  fundamental  (i.e.  as  input  for  theoretical 
models, where high pressure data is practically non-existent), but can also have important 
and  far  reaching  implications  in  geophysics,  where  these  studies  could  eventually  be 
extended  to  a  larger  portion  of  P-T  phase  space  representative  of  the  interior  of  many 
planets  including  the  Earth.  Such  studies  on  bulk  transition  metal  compounds  (oxides, 
silicates, etc...) of direct interest to geophysics would then directly lead to a better insight 
into  correlations  between  structural  and  magnetic  transitions.  The  extension  to  low 
temperatures will offer also very exciting opportunities in the study of strongly correlated 
systems. 
 

3. The energy dispersive XAS beamline ID24 for high pressure XMCD  
 
3.1 Introduction 
 

Beamline  ID24  is  the  ESRF  XAS  beamline  with  parallel  detection  of  the  whole 
spectrum  made  possible  by  energy  dispersive  highly  focusing  X-ray  optics.  The 
absorption  spectrometer  is  coupled  to  two  low  K  undulators  in  a  high  b
  section  of  the 
ring, through a Kirkpatrick Baez (KB) optical system. The energy range of operation is 5 
–  27  keV.  The  spectral  characteristics  required  for  experiments  at  selected  absorption 
edges  are  obtained  by  gap  tuning  and  tapering  the  undulators.  The  original  and  the 
recently  upgraded  design  of  the  beamline  can  be  found  elsewhere  (Hagelstein  et  al., 
1993,  Hagelstein  et  al.,  1997,  Pascarelli  et  al.,  2004).  The  choice  of  an  undulator  for 
energy dispersive XAS applications is unusual, but there are clear advantages in using a 
high brilliance source for high pressure XMCD at low energies. Besides the high flux, the 
small  source  size  coupled  with  appropriate  defocusing  optics  yields  the  required  focal 
spot for high pressure studies, and the low monochromatic divergence allows the optimal 
exploitation  of  the  properties  of  quarter  wave  plates  to  tune  the  helicity  of  incoming 
photons.  In  the  year  1999,  a  local  feedback  system  was  installed  in  the  ID24  straight 
section to control the horizontal instabilities of the electron beam (Pascarelli & Plouviez, 
2000). This implementation led to a substantial improvement in the stability of the focal 
spot and in the quality of the XMCD data collected on ID24. 

This beamline is now particularly suited for high pressure XMCD measurements 
using diamond anvil cells. The undulator source, the absence of mechanical movements 
of the spectrometer during the acquisition of the spectra and the strongly focusing optical 
scheme  of  the  beamline  allow  covering  the  necessary  requirements  for  high  pressure 
XMCD experiments.  

1- A small focal spot. The required focal spot dimensions for applications 
in  the  20-100  GPa  region  are  typically  limited  to  20x20  m m2  full  width.  The 

 

4

undulator  beam  on  ID24  undergoes  double  focusing  in  both  directions  and  its 
dimensions,  in  the  5-9  keV  energy  range  of  interest  to  these  studies,  are  of  this 
order of magnitude. 

2-  A  stable  beam.  The  required  signal-to-noise  ratio  is  obtained  by 
averaging a large number of spectra. During the acquisition of a series of spectra 
to be averaged, the beam has to have excellent spectral and spatial stability. This 
is possible thanks to the dispersive optics scheme. 

3  –  Time  resolution.  Real  time  visualization  of  the  entire  absorption 
spectrum, intrinsic to the dispersive scheme, is extremely useful to align the anvils 
in such a way that diffraction from the diamonds is avoided in the energy range of 
interest.  Moreover,  very  short  acquisition  times  allow  to  average  over  a  large 
number  of  spectra  in  a  reasonable  time.  Typically,  an  acquisition  averaged  over 
200 spectra can be carried out in 30 minutes. 

4 - High flux. To compensate the high level of absorption in the diamond 
cell and in the quarter wave plate and to reach the required signal-to-noise level 
the highest flux possible is needed. 

 

After many years of difficulties, important improvements in the optics (Pascarelli et al., 
2004),  (Mathon  et  al.,  2004)  and  beam  stability  on  ID24  (Pascarelli  &  Plouviez,  2000) 
lead us recently to obtain good S/N high-pressure XMCD signals at the Fe K edge. This 
work is the result of years of collaboration between the ID24 team and the Physique des 
Milieux Condensés laboratory at the University of Paris VI (PMC). Similar studies have 
been carried out at other synchrotrons at the L-edges of 5d transition metals (Odin et al., 
1998),  (Odin  et  al.,  1999)  as  well  as  at  the  K-edge  of  Fe  (Ishimatsu  et  al.,  2001) 
(Ishimatsu et al., 2003). 
 
3.2 The optical scheme 
 
 
Figure  1  illustrates  the  present  optical  scheme  for  XMCD  measurements.  It 
consists of a pair of mirrors in a Kirkpatrick-Baez geometry, the Si (111) polychromator, 
the diamond quarter wave plate (QWP), the third vertically refocusing mirror, the sample 
environment  (the  Diamond  Anvil  Cell,  a  spectrometer  for  pressure  calibration  and  the 
electromagnet)  and  the  position  sensitive  detector  that  transforms  the  energy-direction 
correlation into an energy-position correlation (Koch et al., 1996). Additional details on 
the  standard  optical  setup  may  be  found  in  (Hagelstein  et  al.,  1997),  (Pellicer  Porres et 
al., 1998) (San Miguel et al., 1998) (Pascarelli et al., 2004). 
 
At  the  energies  corresponding  to  the K-edges of 3d transition metals, the full 
dimensions  of  the  focal  spot  are  below  20  m m  in  both  directions.  And  the  total  energy 
range  D E  diffracted  by  the  polychromator  is  of  the  order  of  300  –  400  eV,  allowing 
having access to the edge region (XANES) and to the first few EXAFS oscillations (up to 
a photoelectron wavevector k ~ 8 – 10 Å-1)

XMCD at high pressure (not scaled). 

 
 
The  quarter  wave  plate  is  located  750  mm  downstream  the  polychromator.  It 
consists, for the energy range of K-edge of the 3d transition metals, in a thin (740 m m) 
perfect  diamond  crystal  in  the  Laue  geometry.  Its  birefringence  properties  close  to  a 
Bragg reflection transform the linearly polarized incident X-ray beam into a transmitted 
(non-deviated)  beam  with  circular  polarization  very  close  to  unity  (Giles  et  al.,  1994). 
The  very  small  source  divergence  and  the  non-dispersivity  condition  allow  circular 
polarization close to unity to be obtained on the whole polychromatic and divergent fan 
(Pizzini et al., 1998). XMCD applications on ID24 currently cover a wide energy range, 
that extends from the L edges of rare earths (down to the L3 edge of Ce at 5.7 keV) up to 
the L edges of 5d metals (up to the L2 edge of Pt at 13.3 keV). To cover this wide energy 
range, ID24 disposes of a set of three quarter wave plates (two diamond plates and one Si 
plate)  designed  and  commissioned  on  ID24  in  collaboration  with  C.  Malgrange  of  the 
LMCP of the Paris 6 University. 
The third mirror is installed on the polychromatic beam after the QWP, at 0.6 m 
 
upstream the focal point. A complete description and the performance of this mirror can 
be found in (Pascarelli et al., 2004) and (Hignette et al., 2001).

A new sample environment has been specifically developed for the high pressure 
XMCD applications, in order to concentrate in a compact volume the high pressure cell, 
the  laser  spectrometer  for  the  pressure  measurement  and  the  magnetic  field.  The  high 
pressure cell is made of non-magnetic CuBe, manufactured by the Laboratory PMC. Its 
design derives from the Chervin type membrane cell (Chervin et al., 1995). The HP-DAC 
is located on a stack of motorization stages that allows its alignment to the beam: vertical 
Z and horizontal X (transverse to the beam direction) translation stages, rotation around 
the vertical Z axis and around the horizontal X axis and rotation around the X-ray beam 
direction. The last three stages are used to remove diffraction peaks originating from the 
diamonds  that  fall  in  the  energy  range  of  interest.  The  use  of  perforated  diamonds  has 
shown to be useful to limit the absorption of the X-ray beam by the diamonds (Dadashev 
et  al.,  2001).  We  have  recently  tested  such  diamonds  in  the  5-7  keV  range  on  D11 
(LURE,  Orsay)  (Itié  et  al.  2003)  and  on  ID24  (San  Miguel  et  al.,  2004)  up  to  30  GPa. 
Due to the thickness of the HP-DAC (30 mm) the magnetic field obtained on the sample 
with our classical electromagnetic coil was limited to 0.4 Tesla.

we  effectively  suppress  linear  and  exponential    drifts  of  different  origins  and  work 
exclusively  with  the  transmitted  intensities.  This  is  an  advantage  in  energy  dispersive 
XAS,  where  it  is  as  yet  not  possible  to  measure  simultaneously  the  incident  and 
transmitted  intensities,  although  work  is  being  devoted  to  the  development  of  this 
acquisition  scheme.  The  XMCD  signal  can  therefore  be  directly  reconstructed  by

In  order  to  reduce  systematic  errors,  we  record,  at  each  pressure  point,  the  4  symmetry 
cases  of  the  XMCD  signal  obtained  by  flipping  the  helicity  of  the  incoming  photons 
(RCP/LCP) and the magnetic field +/- with the following sequences : RCP field +, RCP 
field  -,  LCP  field  –  and  LCP  field  +.  The  XMCD  signals  are  then  calculated 
independently  for  the  two  RCP  and  LCP  cases.  Taking  the  average  of  these  2 
measurements greatly reduces systematic errors and highlights the magnetic origin of the 
calculated signal. 
Figure 2 presents the normalized XMCD and XAS signals obtained in ambient conditions 
(without the DAC) on a pure Fe foil using a magnetic field H = 0.5 Tesla. The amplitude 
of  the  XMCD  signal  is  ~  3.2.10-3  This  value  is  comparable  to  the  amplitude  of  2.10-3 
calculated  by  (Ankudinov  &  Rehr,  1997)  showing  that  the  measurement  procedure  and 
the beamline setup are correct for both right and left polarization (in particular the degree 
of circular polarization obtained with the quarter wave plate is close to unity).

magnetic phase at around 15 GPa. This transition has been the subject of many structural 
(mainly  XRD)  and  magnetic  studies.  Using  XAS,  it  was  possible  to  follow  the 
reorganization  of  the  local  structure  during  the  fcc  –  hcp  phase  transition  (Wang  & 
Ingals, 1998). The two phases were found to coexist in a large pressure domain starting at 
13 GPa and spreading over 8 GPa. The evolution of the magnetic moment with pressure 
has  been  followed  by  Mössbauer  spectroscopy  (Taylor  et  al.,  1991)  and  by  X-ray 
emission  spectroscopy  (Rueff  et  al.,  1999).  These  studies  agree  that  at  the  end  of  the 
transition,  the  iron  bears  no  magnetic  moment.  X-ray  emission  indicates  that  the  Fe 
magnetic moment follows roughly the bcc phase fraction extracted from a previous XAS 
study (Wang & Ingals, 1998).  

By  recording  simultaneously  XAS  and  XMCD  we  can  correlate  with  high 
precision the changes in the magnetic moment on Fe with an accurate evaluation of the 
bcc  phase  fraction  during  the  transition.  This  gives  us  the  opportunity  to  conclude 
whether  the  magnetism  follows  exactly  the  bcc  phase  stoichiometry  during  the  phase 
transition.  As  an  example,  figure  3  shows  XMCD  and  XANES  signals  recorded  at 
pressures  of  10  and  15.4  GPa.  These  signals  have  been  recorded  on  a  pure  iron  foil  of 
50x50x4 m m3 using 400 m m culet diamonds and an Inconel gasket with a 200 m m hole. 
Silicon  oil  was  used  as  a  pressurizing  medium.  Pressure  was  measured  using  the  ruby 
fluorescence method (Forman et al., 1972). These XMCD profiles are typically obtained 
using integration times between 1 and 2 hours.

due to small defects of the polychromator crystal. 

 
4.2. Magnetite under pressure 

A  combined  XANES-XMCD  study  has  been  performed  on  m m  sized  magnetite 
(Fe3O4)  powder  between  0  and  30  GPa  at  room  temperature.  Below  6  GPa,  magnetite 
crystallizes in the inverse spinel structure in which tetrahedral A sites contain one third of 
the  Fe  ions  as  Fe3+,  while  octahedral  B  sites  contain  the  remaining  Fe  ions  with  equal 
number  of  Fe3+  and  Fe2+.  Below  860  K  magnetite  shows  ferrimagnetic  behavior  with 
magnetic  moments  on  site  A  aligned  antiparallel  to  magnetic  moments  on  site  B 
(Anisimov  et  al.,  1996).  Above  6  GPa  the  phase  transition  process  is  still  under 
discussion (Rozenberg et al., 1996), (Todo et al., 2001). 
Figure  5  shows  normalized  XMCD  and  XANES  signals  obtained  at  10  GPa.  A  clear 
XMCD  signal  is  visible  that  exhibits  two  components.  The  data  is  currently  being 
analyzed. This data has been obtained using a 400 m m culet diamonds and a 30 m m thick 
Inconel  gasket  with  a  200  m m  diameter  hole.  Silicone  oil  was  used  as  pressurization 
medium. The mass ratio between the powder and the silicone oil is adjusted to obtain a 
spectrum with a jump approximately equal to 1.

5. Concluding remarks 

 

We  demonstrate  the  possibility  to  record  high  S/N  XMCD  and  XANES  spectra 
under  high  pressure  at  the  Fe  K  edge  on  the  ID24  energy  dispersive  beamline  of  the 
ESRF. XANES and XMCD carried out in the same thermodynamical conditions provide

information on the correlation between the local structure and the magnetic properties of 
the  Fe  sites.  This  data  can  contribute  to  the  basic  understanding  of  the  XMCD  K-edge 
process as input for theoretical calculations.  

Combined  with  the  development  of  perforated  diamond  anvils,  these  studies 
provide a new tool to probe the magnetism of 3d transition metals and rare earths under 
pressure.  In  the  near  future,  we  plan  to  equip  our  high  pressure  experimental  setup  on 
ID24 with a He cryostat, to open the field to XMCD measurements under pressure at low 
temperature. 
 
The authors would like to acknowledge the work of the technical and engineering team of 
ID24 that makes these experiments possible: M.-C. Dominguez, T. Mairs and F. Perrin. 
We  are also very grateful to the ESRF Crystal Laboratory, in particular to P. Villermet 
and J.-P. Vassali.

Abstract:  The  noise  figure  and  photon  probability  distribution  are  calculated  for  coherent  anti-Stokes  Raman 
scattering (CARS) where an anti-Stokes signal is converted to Stokes. We find that the minimum noise figure is ~ 
3dB.  
 
1.  Introduction  
 

Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) is a nonlinear, parametric process with a wide application in 
spectroscopy and in data conversion [1,2,3]. The problem that we examine is the following: how are the signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) and photon statistics of an input signal at one sideband (say the Stokes frequency) modified when 
the signal is converted to the other sideband (say the anti-Stokes frequency)? 

The  CARS  process  necessarily  introduces  extra  noise  in  the  converted  signal  because  it  occurs  through  the 
Raman nonlinear optical susceptibility. Since the process involves the interaction of damped optical phonons with 
the incident frequency in a medium, noise is introduced in the system. Therefore, in order to formulate the process 
mathematically, one needs a Langevin noise source to correctly model the dissipation. In what follows we use this 
principle to calculate some of the noise properties of the converted optical signal. We calculate the noise figure and 
for the first time we obtain an analytic expression for the photon statistics.

Hamiltonian). Due to the damping term, the commutator of the phonon mode will not be invariant in time unless a 
noise source is introduced. For the damping term in equation (1c), the noise source operator that must be added is

The results deviate from the ideal optical amplifier noise figure by a factor which depends on the ratio of the photon 
energies  of  the  Stokes  and  anti-Stokes  waves.  Therefore,  the  extra  deterioration  (or  improvement  in  the  case  of 
Stokes to Anti-Stokes conversion) in the SNR is due to the change in photon energy at the conversion process.

We find that with perfect phase matching the best noise figure is  
noise to the signal. The photon probability distribution of the converted signal was also calculated when the input is 
a coherent state.

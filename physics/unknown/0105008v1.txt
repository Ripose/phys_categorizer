The theory of special relativity [1] deal with the differences in physical element like
time, mass, energy and length on systems that move in uniform velocities relative
to each other. Conventional special relativity argues there is no preferred frame.
And  the  measured  magnitude  of  the  physical  elements  are  relative  to  the
observed frame.

In the theory of  general relativity there is a privileged inertial frame the magnitude
of  the  physical  elements  depends  on  the  gravity  and  mass  surround  them  .For
example  the  time  change  of  an  object  in  general  relativity  can  be  calculated
absolutely from the mass and gravitation influence on the  object.

*The research was conducted when the author was in Bar-Ilan University.

(cid:21)

There were several attempts to show that there is a privileged frame [2-7].

We found a new definite explanation and cause , for a distinction of the privileged
inertial frame between two frames, which move in uniform velocity relative to each
other.  Applying  this  physical  explanation  to  the  phenomena  treated  in  special
relativity  equations  result  in  modified  equations  that  gives  in  some  cases  new
results and can explain experiment results that are not matched with calculations
of conventional special relativity equations.

The  physical  difference  we  found  between  two  frames  which  move  in  uniform
velocity  relative  to  each  other  is  that  only  one  of  the  frame  experienced
acceleration  which  brings  the  frame  or  object  to  uniform  velocity  relative  to  the
other .The magnitude of the relativistic phenomena depend on the length of time
the  object  accelerated  in  the  past  .The  period  of  acceleration  in  the  past  can
looked  as  phase  transition  which  cause  the  special  relativity  phenomena  in  the
frame  or  object  that  move  later  in  uniform  velocity.  This  is  an  extension  of  the
general  theory  of  relativity  equivalence  principle,  which  state  that  acceleration
equal  gravitation.  Like  the  gravity  in  the  theory  of  general  relativity  which
influenced time dilation, an acceleration  period in the past which bring frame to
uniform  velocity  couse  phenomena  like  time  dilation,  A  frame  which  did  not
experience acceleration period in the past to  reach the uniform velocity may look
like  moving  when  observed  from  other  frame  but  does  not  have  relativity
phenomena.

We analyze Keating and haflee experiment [8-9] of flying atomic clock around the
world and comparing  the time difference between the clock which stayed at the
surface and the clocks which circled earth , and find the experiment results are in
agreement with our theory.

We  give  here  modified  equations  for  space  time  coordinates  ,additions  of
velocities, mass and energy.

Finding that acceleration period in the past cause the special relativity effect in the
frame  which  after  the  acceleration  moves  in  uniform  velocity  bring  us  to  the
conclusion  that  even  an  object  which  looked  at  rest  in  one  scale  can  be
considered to move, on a bigger scale .For example a star looked to be at rest for
an object on it's surface but it moves on a scale of a galaxy. This means that in
the in the past the star experienced acceleration which bring it to this velocity. This
leads us to the conclusion of Universal Inertial Frame, which is the absolute rest
frame for all objects. In the Big bang theory this frame can be considered as the
Big bang location before the expansion.      We suggest a way to find the velocity
of earth relative to this universal inertial frame.

We start with a physical description.

Assume a moving fame with velocity  v, t is the time in the inertial  frame and t' is
the time in the moving reference frame, c is the velocity of light. The coordinates
in the inertial and the reference frame are x and x' respectively.

                  Consider two clocks, A and B which are placed on coordinates

0  and  x1  respectively  on  the  x-axis  in  the  inertial  frame.  Clocks  A  and  B  are
synchronized with each other. Clock C moves with velocity V in this frame. Clock
C passes clock A at t=0 and x=0.At this point ,clock c set it's time to be t'=0,so
x'=0 .When C is passing clock B, a camera in B's inertial frame photographs both
clock B and C, and a camera in C's frame photographs both clock B and C. The
two cameras are positioned at  equal distances from  the  crossing  point  to  avoid
time difference due to different light propagating distances.

We have two pictures of the same physical state but the clock indicators positions
would be different in the pictures.

Our solution to the problem comes from the discovery that there is a  difference
between  the  two  frames.  Only  one  of  the  frames  accelerated  to  reach  velocity
V.The acceleration period is the source to the special relativistic phenomena.

a(tp) is the time dependent acceleration, tp present time in the past,t1 is the time
until the body reaches velocity V and stops accelerating .The integration between
0 to t1 are between to events in the past. For example the acceleration accrued
between 3/2/2000 to 4/4/2000,later the object or frame stopped accelerating and
continue  to  move  in  uniform  velocity  till  the  present.  The  measurement  of  the
relativistic phenomena is when the object move in uniform velocity.

We  substitute  our,  eq.  4,  to  the  Lorentz  coordinates  transformations  equations

x,t  are  the  coordinated  in  the  inertial  frame.  x',t'  are  the  coordinates  in  a  moving
reference  frame  that  moves  in  uniform  velocity  V  relative  to  the  inertial  frame.The
coordinates  x,t,x',t' are in the present .The terms a(tp), dtp inside the integral are in the
past.t1 is the time until  the object reach  uniform velocity.

The coordinates equations where x',t'  are considered as the rest frame are identical to
Eq. [5] because the inertial frame is always the frame which has not accelerated and
the frame which has relativistic effects is the frame which accelerated to velocity V.

 We can use our result to explain the famous twin paradox.

The  twin  paradox  considers  two  twins,  one  is  flying  into  space  and  returns  to

earth, the other stays on earth. The one who flew into space aged less. The usual

explanation [10] is that the twin who flew into space experienced  acceleration so

his time changed slower.From our result we can conclude that the time difference

between the two twins is not relay solely on the act of acceleration which can take

An infinitesimal time and it's influence would be infinitesimal .  The time period of

acceleration is important because the speed the twin reaches determine the factor

of the time difference, the time difference between the two twins is depends on

this factor multiply by the amount of time the flying twin move in uniform velocity.

The faster is the uniform velocity, reached by this acceleration and the longer is

the  time  of  movement  in  this  uniform  velocity,  the  larger  is  the  time  difference

between the two twins when they meet again, as seen from the second equation

in eq .5.

       The equation for the total energy

                     The modified equation for total energy  is depend on the acceleration period  

                      in the past .E0 is the total energy at inertial frame.

Since m2 is dependent on the acceleration from 0 velocity, it has different values
When  observing  from  s'  frame  if  the  velocity  compares  to  frame  s'  is  u'  or  -u'.
Assume mass m is accelerated to reach velocity u' relative to earth , first in the
direction of earth's rotation , and in the second case  to velocity u' relative to earth
in  the  opposite  direction  of  earth  rotation.  The  earth  rotation  velocity  V  ,is
assumed in this example as the velocity relative to the inertial frame, m0 is the rest
mass at the inertial frame . m1 is the rest mass on the surface of the earth and m2
is the mass with velocity  u' relative to earth's surface .The mass will be different in

We obtained that special relativistic phenomena derived from a time region where
the object accelerated to reach its uniform velocity. We want to find the absolute
inertial frame, which didn't experience any acceleration .This absolute frame is an
inertial frame to the all universe (on special relativity aspect).

We  define  the  Universal  Inertial  Frame  as  the  frame  which  all  the  objects  that
compared to  this  frame  are  considering  as  moving,  experienced  acceleration  in
the past.

We can conduct an experiment where we  check mass in continuity of velocities
and in different directions, to find the universal inertial frame velocity. If we move
the measured mass in a velocity  which is opposite to it's velocity relative to  the
universal  inertial  frame  both  velocities  would  cancel  and  we  get  the  mass
magnitude in the universal inertial frame, this is the minimum mass value obtained
in a measurement .The magnitude of this opposite velocity is equal to the velocity
of the system relative to the universal inertial frame.

Another  method  to  obtain  the  velocity  of  the  universal  inertial  frame  is  by
Measuring  the  rate  of  an  atomic  clock  at  different  speeds  and  in  different
directions  this  gives  different  clock  rates.  When  the  rate  is  the  highest,  after
eliminating the effects of the earth non-inertial frame, we get the universal inertial
frame velocity.

u is the velocity relative to the universal inertial frame,
dt is the rate of the moving clock, dt0 is the rate of the clock at rest in the universal
inertial frame .For v>u' while v is the velocity of earth relative to the universal inertial
frame  dt  will  be  higher  than  the  clock  rate  at  earth.  Though  in  some  cases  a  clock
which move relative to earth surface its time rate can be measured on the surface to
be  higher  than  a  clock  at  rest  on  the  surface.  The  best  place  to  find  the  universal
inertial frame is in space  where the influence of the rotational movement of earth is
reduced.

The  Universal  inertial  frame  can  be  considered  as  the  Big  Bang  source  before  the
expansion.  To those, which are not convinced in the theory of the Big Bang, a future
experiment  for  measuring  the  Universal  inertial  frame  with  matter  from  several
locations  in  the  Universe  could  determine  if  the  Universe  really  expanded  from  one

location. If the Universe expands from one location, rate measurement of an atomic
clock made of matter from one place in the Universe when compared to the rate of an
atomic clock made of matter from another place in the Universe, would show that the
highest rate of both clocks when measured at the same place is obtained at the same
direction  and  velocity,  then  both  matters  come  from  the  same  origin.  If  the  result
shows two different directions or velocities, then there are two origins.

Hafele and Kiting experiment [9] strongly support the existence of a Universal Inertial
frame.    In this experiment four cesium beam atomic clocks were flown around the
world twice, once eastward and once westward to test the theory of relativity. The time
difference between the flying clock and the clock which stayed on the earth's surface,
was  compared.  The  flying  clock  lost  59  -  +  10  nanosecond  during  the  eastward
direction and gained 273 - + 7 nanoseconds during the westward trip.    If we analyze
a plane flight in  around the  world trip  it is seen  that most of the time the plain fly  in
uniform  velocity  .In  order  to  fly  in  circular,  track  the  plane  seldom  make  an  angular
correction of  it's flying direction, this and the time the plain change it's height because
of elevation forces are the only time the plain experience radial acceleration, which is
negligible compare to the flight period.                        
The result can only be explained  by taking into  account the  universal  inertial  frame.
The earth has a rotational velocity, in the eastward direction flight the velocity of the
plane is positively added to the earth velocity and increased the velocity of the clock
on the plane relative to the universal inertial frame and the clock lose time relative to
the clock which stayed on the surface .In the westward trip the plane velocity added
negatively  to  the  earth  velocity  this  decrease  the  velocity  of  the  clocks  on  plane
relative to the universal inertial frame and the clocks gained time relative to the clock
which stayed on the surface .

                   

In  the  conventional  special  relativity  the  time  difference  is  calculated  as  taking  the
clock  on  the  surface  as  being  in  an  inertial  frame,  the  frame  can  be  considered  as
inertial in infinitesimal increment. The plain is considered to move in velocity v in the
eastward trip and in velocity v but in the opposite direction in the westward trip .The
time dilation in conventional special relativity depend on the square of v, eq .1. In both
directions the clocks on the plane lose time relative to the clock on the surface, this is
not in agreement with the experimental results.

Fig 3: The circle represent earth with tangential velocity  VT .  A is a plane flying in

Velocity  V relative to earth's surface. B is the flying plane  that is flying in velocity

Relative to earth's surface but in the opposite direction to A.

Considering  the  North  pole  as  inertial  frame  [8]  give  a  closer  result  to  the
experiment, although this frame does not gives a direct comparison between the
clock  in  the  surface  frame  and  the  flying  clock  like  in  the  twin  paradox.
There  are  other  difficulties,  the  experiment  showed  no  symmetry  in  the  mean
errors  between  the  experience  and  the  predicted  results  at  the  eastward  and
westward directions. For the westward direction the mean difference between the
predicted  and  the  experiment  results  is  0.7%  and  the  mean  difference  in  the
eastward  direction  is  15%.  This  implies  the  inertial  frame  considered  is  not  the
exact  inertial  frame.  Although  Hafele  and  Keating  predicted  calculations  gave  a
good approximation to the experience result by using the north pole as the inertial
frame in the calculations and not only conventional special relativity, Calculations
of the exact inertial frame should take into account the Universal Inertial Frame.

A suggested applicable experiment to prove the phenomena we discussed here
and  can  be  cunducted  in  a  laboratory,  with  aid  of  Mossbauer  effect  appears  in
[11] .

In summary, the relativistic effects of special relativity are derived from integration
of the acceleration over a period of time before the object move in uniform velocity
and  the  measurement  of  the  special  relativity  phenomena  begin.      This
complements  full explanation of  the twin paradox.      A universal reference frame

(cid:20)(cid:22)

is obtained. It implies that on a proper direction there is a range of velocity in which
the  rate  of  time  on  a  moving  frame  can  increase,  the  magnitude  of  mass  can
decrease. While in the standard special relativity the time rate of a moving frame
can only decrease compared to rate on earth and the magnitude of mass can only
increase .   An experiment based on the rate's  measurement of atomic clock as
we described could discover the speed the Earth moves relative to the Universe
before the Big Bang.

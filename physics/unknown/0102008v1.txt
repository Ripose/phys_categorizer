Invariablly  justified  representations  of  the  Wave  Universe  Concept  -  WU  Concept  (See 
monography  -  Chechelnitsky 
.  Extremum,  Stability  and  Resonance  in  Astrodynamics...,  etc. 
and  other  publications)  indicate  a  principle  incorrectness  of  expectations  of  Standard  (Model) 
cosmology about  homogeneity and isotropy of the Universe.

It  also  is  connected  with  observational  data  about  apparent  hierarchy  of  giant  astronomical 
systems  (stellar  systems,  galaxies,  clusters  of  galaxies,  superclusters  of  galaxies,  etc.),  their 
megawave  structure,  quantization  "in  the  Large",  non-homogeneity  of  microwave  background 
Space radiation, adequately interpreted (in frameworks WU Concept) effects redshifts quantization 
of quasars, etc.  

The  principle  absence  of  a  Limit  of  Hierarchy  of  Matter  Levels  asserts:  "The  Staircase  of  a 

Matter" - is endless. 

For  orientation  of  the  explorers,  working  with  the  observational  data,  in  frameworks  of  WU 
Concept  the  concrete  characteristics  of  following  (behind  superclusters  of  galaxies)  potentially 
possible  extremely  large  astronomical  systems  are  calculated  with  using  the  Fundamental 
parameter of Hierarchy – Chechelnitsky Number c  = 3.66(6). 

The astronomical systems, belonging to the nearest hierarchy Levels of Solar-Like systems, are 

characterized by external radiuses [a(k) = c k a(0), a(0) = 39.373 AU] 

a(20) = 36.83, a(21) = 135, a(22) = 495, a(23) = 1815 Mpc. 

It is possible to expect that in the Universe also exist and should show itself in observations (the 

Solar-Like objects) – extremely large astronomical systems (ELAS), characterized by the external 
radiuses (of peripherals) 

a(26) = 89503, a(27) = 328177, a(28) = 1203318 Mpc. 
 

COSMOLOGY - STANDARD MODEL: 
At Last There Will Set of Long-Awaited Homogeneity... 
 

Almost  whole  century  the  cosmology  of  new  time  is  in  painful  expectation:  It  demands  from 
observational  astrophysics  to  confirm  a  postulate,  similar  to  dream,  of  the  refined  theory:  The 
Universe - is homogeneitic and is isotropic. 

Unfortunately,  for  the  supporters  of  Standard  model  the  triumph  of  the  prescriptions  of  the 
prevailing  theory  permanently  is  sidetracked.  It  -  lengthy  and  (would  be  desirable  to  believe) 
instructive history. 
 
TOWARDS TO (MEGA) WAVE UNIVERSE 
 
What - Beyond the Horizon of (Visible) Universe? 

Today, being grounded on competitive representations of Standard Model of a Cosmology and 
of  the  Wave  Universe  Concept  (WU  Concept)  it  is  interesting  to  attempt  to  answer  on  following 
(probably, anticipatory and impatient) problem: 

What will meet tomorrow (in XXI century - in III millenary) grown-up, more technically equipped 
and,  probably,  conceptually  more  perfect  astronomy,  astrophysics,  cosmology  in  the  Universe  - 
Monotonic Desert of homogeneous "gas" (clusters, superclusters) galaxies? 

Or,  "having  tightened"  for  some  Levels  of  Matter,  it  will  find  out  new,  more  extended 

consolidated, close to stationary, astronomical objects of the extremely large sizes and masses?

What - Behind a World of Superclusters of Galaxies? 

In other words, whether there will be a cosmology hereafter again opened Levels and Layers of 
a  Matter,  physically  isolated  astronomical  systems  superior  the  sizes  of  observed  at  present 
superclusters of galaxies? 

Not sidetracking, we at once, here and now, attempt to answer this problem, being grounded on 

representations of the Wave Universe Concept (WU Concept). 

So, 
#  It  is  necessary  to  expect,  that  purposeful  researches  and  the  future  successes  of  an 
observational astrophysics really will lead to detection of astronomical objects more high rank, than 
superclusters of galaxies. 

#Potentially  possible,  to  the  greatest  degree  probable  characteristics  of  these  extremely  large 

astronomical objects can be indicated as outcome of the analysis in frameworks of WU Concept. 
 
THE WAVE UNIVERSE CONCEPT (WU CONCEPT). 
WAVE ASTRODYNAMICS 
 

The  Wave  Universe  Concept  (WU  Concept)  and  fundamental  ideas  of  Wave  astrodynamics 
[Chechelnitsky,  1990  -1999]  are  connected  with  representations  that  the  large  astronomical 
systems  in  the  theoretical  plan  are  not  only  multiparticle  dynamic  systems  in  sense  Poincare-
Birkgof,  but  are  considered  as  essentially  Wave  Dynamic  Systems  (WDS),  systems,  being 
somewhat analogues of atom. 
 
The Fundamental Wave Equations. 
Stability, Quantization of Megasystems 

The theoretical aspects of these problems (in particular, eigenproblem of the Fundamental wave 
equations)  both  appropriate  astronomical  and  astrophysical  questions  are  discussed  in  the 
monography [Chechelnitsky, 1980] and subsequent publications. 
 
SHELL STRUCTURE OF ASTRONOMICAL SYSTEMS 
 

The  any  astronomical  systems  of  the  Universe  considered  as  wave  dynamic  systems  (WDS) 
have  shell  structure,  in  many  respects  similar  with  shell  structure  of  Solar  -  planetary  system 
[Chechelnitsky, 1980, 1983-1986]. 

The exceptions in this sense and numerous satellite systems of planets do not constitute, it is 

good verified by experience, observations and space experiments. 
 
Shell Hierarchy 

In  that  case,  the  astronomical  system  considered  as  WDS,  is  characterized  by  hierarchy 
enclosed each other spatially and structurally (radially) of the divided areas - G[s] Shells (s = ..., -2, 
-1, 0, 1, 2, 3...). 

Inducing  experience  in  research  of  wave  shell  structure  of  any  astronomical  systems  are  the 
results  of  an  experimental  research  of  Solar  system  -  most  in  details  and  authentically  known 
astronomical system. 

In Solar - Planetary system some spatially divided shells - can be clearly identified, at least - 

     G [0] - Intra - Mercurian; 
     G [1] - taken by space of planets I (Earth) group; 
     G [2] - taken by space of planets II (Jupiter) group; 
     G [3] - Trans - Pluto etc. 
 
Sound Velocities Hierarchy. 
Fundamental Parameter of Hierarchy 

The  hierarchy  of  the  C*

[s]  sound  velocities  -  phase  velocities  of  the  (multicomponent  cosmic 
medium)  cosmic  plasma  small  perturbations  (megawaves)  [Chechelnitsky,  1984,1986]  is  closely 
connected with the hierarchy of G[s] Shells

"Magic Number" (Chechelnitsky Number, FPH) c
Role and Status of Fundamental Parameter of Hierarchy in Universe. 

c =3,66(6).  

Previous  after  primary  publications  [Chechelnitsky,  1980-1985]  time  and  new  investigations  to  
the  full  extent  convince  the  theory  expectations,  in  particular,  connected  with  the  G[s]  Shells 
hierarchy in each of such WDS, with the hierarchy of Levels of matter (and WDS) in Universe, with 
the exceptional role of the introduced in the theory  c   FPH [Chechelnitsky, (1978) 1980-1986].    

The very brief resume of some aspects of these investigations may be formulated in frame of 

following short suggestion. 
Proposition (Role and Status of c  FPH in Universe) [Chechelnitsky, (1978) 1980-1986] 

# T he  central  parameter,  which  organizes  and  orders  the  dynamical  and  physical  structure, 

geometry, hierarchy of Universe 

*  "Wave Universe (WU) Staircase" of matter Levels, 
*  Internal structure each of real systems - wave  dynamic systems (WDS) at any Levels of 
matter, is (manifested oneself) c  - the Fundamental  Parameter Hierarchy (FPH) - nondimensional 
number  c   =3,66(6). 

# It  may  be  expected,  that  investigations,  can  show  in  the  full  scale,  that  c   -  FPH,  generally 
speeking,  presents  and  appeares  everywhere  -  in  any  case,  -  in  an  extremely  wide  circle  of 
dynamical relations, which reflect the geometry, dynamical structure, hierarchy of real systems of 
Universe. 

We aren't be able now and at once to appear all well-known to us relations and multiple links, in  

which  oneself  the [Chechelnitsky]  c =3.66(6) "Magic Number" manifests. 

We hope that all this stands (becomes) possible in due time and with new opening opportunities  

for the publications and communications.

HIERARCHY STRUCTURE OF WAVE UNIVERSE.   
STEPS OF HIERARCHY. A STAIRCASE OF  MATTER 
 
Hierarchy of Solar - Similar Systems. 

According  to  representations  of  the  Wave  Universe  Concept  (WU  Concept)  the  Hierarchy  of 
Solar - similar systems (Solar-like Systems - SL Systems) can be shown, first of all, by Homology - 
by Homologous series of Main dynamic parameters - parameters of the Kepler  

K(k) = c k K (0)       k= …, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, … 

 = 1.32712438(cid:215) 1011 

3(cid:215) s-2 - Main dynamic parameter - parameter of the Kepler - 

c  = 3.66(6) - Fundamental parameters of hierarchy (Chechelnitsky Number) [Chechelnitsky, 

where

~

Gravity parameter of the Solar System (Sun); 

df

(1978) 1980, 1980-1986]; 

k = 1,2,3,  ...  - countable parameter. 

The  Sun  and  Solar  system  are  most  well  investigated  objects  of  a  population  of  stars  and 
planetary systems, in many respects are typical, steady enough, well observed representatives of 
a Layer (and Levels) of Matter - stars - one of the brightest component of a Staircase of Matter. It is 
necessary  to  expect,  that  been  transposed  in  other  Levels  of  Matter,  the  representatives  of  a 
Homologous series K(k) also will appear by reference, quite typical, steady enough, it is good and 
widely observed objects. 

In other words, it is necessary to expect, that K(k) and at other Levels of a Matter U(k) also will  

appear quite representative, widespread objects, such as the Sun and  Solar system. 

These expectations can be affirmed by the observational data. 

 
The Basis for Selection of Solar-Like Systems. 
We are reverted to the analysis of Hierarchy of Solar - like systems, at least, by virtue of following 
circumstances: 

# Determinancy. 
Dynamic  and  physical  properties  of  the  Sun  and  the  Solar  systems  are  known  with 
extraordinary accuracy (as contrasted to by set of diverse astronomical objects). It means, as all 
Homologous  series  of  Solar-similar  systems  is  representable  quite  definitely  with  reasonable 
accuracy. 

# Representativity. 
The  Sun  -  as  an  star  is the quite typical representative of a Layer of stars in a Staircase of a 
Matter.    About  it  speaks,  for  example,  a  median  position  of  the  Sun  on  the  Hertzsprung-Russel 
diagramm. It is necessary to expect, that other generated components of a Homologous series of 
Solar–like systems (for example, in a Layer of galaxies) also will be quite representative objects at 
the conforming Levels of a Matter. 
 
Hierarchy of External Sizes of Systems (Plut

-Like Orbits). 

As a subject for the analysis it is interesting to consider also Homologous series of Pluto-Like 

h

Orbits - PL Orbits, External PL Sizes, connected with Hierarchy of Solar - like systems. 

If to accept as a generating component (Eponym) the semi-major axis of orbit of Pluto (

than a Homologous series of  external  (PL)  sizes  of Solar-Like systems will look like this:

external  (PL)  sizes  will  describe  (maximal)  peripheral  -  external  sizes  -  radiuses  of  astronomical 
systems of corresponding U(k) Levels of Matter. Its are the most simplly and directly observed in an 
astrophysics values – linear dimensional characteristics of astronomical systems - clusters of stars, 
galaxies [see the Table]. 
 
Extremely - Large Astronomical Systems. First Steps. 

Analysing a Homologous series of external (PL) sizes, it is possible at once directly to indicate 

potentially possible existence in the Universe of extremely - large astronomical systems (objects).

It  is  possible  to  expect,  for  example,  that  in  the  Universe  exist  and  should  show  itself  in 
observations (Solar-Like objects) - extremely large astronomical systems (ELAS), characterized by 
the sizes (external) radiuses of peripherals

sense  conforming  to  a  Level  of  Matter  -  of  our  Galaxy  (or  of  galaxy

If  to  consider  a  Level  of  Matter  -  Solar  system  (Layer  of  stars)  (external  size)  in  any  dynamic 
31  Andromeda)  (Layer  of 
G),  than  for  following  higher  (ELAS)  Layer  of  Matter  (the  external  size 
ELAS) is possible to record a following ratio (of similarity) of external sizes of astronomical systems 
aG / aSS,P ~  aELAS / aG

From here we have                           aELAS ~  (aG)2/aSS,P 
In more detail such conclusion follows from consideration, connected with definite isomorphism 

of Layers of Matter. 
 
Stability - Observability. 

The  general  reasons  about  a  problem  "Stability  -  Observability"  can  be  found  out  in  the 

monography (Chechelnitsky, 1980).  

But  the  problem  of  stability,  so,  and  actual  observability  of  objects  of high Levels of hierarchy 

represents the special, non trivial problem. It merits the special discussion. 
 
Isomorphism of Layers of Matter - Stars and Galaxies. 

From the point of view of WU Concept representations the hierarchical structure of themselves 

Layers of Matter in definite dynamic sense - is look-alike. 

The definite similarity - isomorphism of Layers of a Matter - stars and galaxies can be observed 
if to compare, for example, Levels of Matter U(0) of a Layer of stars and U(13) (or U(14)) of Layer of 
galaxies and further, accordingly, subsequent Levels of Matter (U(1) and U(14), U(2) and U(15), etc.). 

In that case it appears, that the aggregates - clusters of galaxies (clusters, clusters of clusters, 
etc)  correspond  to  aggregates  -  clusters  of  stars  (clusters  of  stars,  spherical  clusters,  etc).  The 
capability  also  opens  to  present  dynamic  structure  nowadays  of  unknowns  at  high  Levels  of  a 
Layer of Matter - galaxies on the basis of comparison with dynamic stucture of known high Levels 
of Matter of a Layer of Matter - of stars. 
 
The Nearest Levels of Matter. 

But today, apparently, the problem of existence of grandiose astronomical systems located on 
the  nearest  steps  of  Hierarchy  of  the  Universe  is  most  actual.  It  is  dictated  by  capabilities  and 
technical limitations of a modern observational astrophysics. 

If  to  consider,  that  at  present  clearly  identifiable  astronomical  systems  (the  superclusters  of 

galaxies) are characterized by external sizes - radiuses of the order 
a ~  30 h-1 
    (Peebles, 1980 (1983)),

Whether  is  contingency  the  close  conformity  of  these  data  obtained  from  processing  of  the 
cataloques  (Abell,  Zwicky)  of  galaxies  clusters  with  the  analysis  and  expectations  of  the  Wave 
Universe Concept?

The Law of Generalized Dichotomy and External Sizes of Astronomical Systems. 

At statistical processing of the cataloques of galaxies clusters it find out a series of maxima in 
distribution of the characteristics of the sizes of galaxies aggregates (clusters). Thus at processing 
the isolated nature of these aggregates implicitly is meant. 

Agrees [LSS:  Rudnicki, Zieba], this series of maxima - preferential sizes looks like

In  frameworks  WU  Concept  the  latent  sense  of  such  distribution  can  be  realized.  The 
preferential  sizes  of  aggregates  (clusters)  of  galaxies  appear  by  connected  with  the  Law  of 
generalized dichotomy

Generally  speaking,  it  is  follows  with  fear  to  approach  to  results  of  statistical  processing  of 
rather vast, but heterogeneous stuff. Occasionally, the desired signal (availability of maxima) is lost 
("is washed") in a massif of such rich data set. Be it – case history to a maxim "best - enemy of 
good". 

In any case, detail critical analysis of such works merits separate, special discussion. 

 
View Ad Infinitum:  
About a Capability of Existence of Extreme - Large Astronomical Systems. 

If not to limit by consideration only of nearest Levels and Layers of Matter, the Wave Universe 
Concept gives a capability to investigate (for the present - theoretically) an hierarchical stucture of 
the Universe, in principle, at any Levels and Layers of Matter. All Hierarchy of the Wave Universe, 
all Staircase of Matter - potentially is opened for free and unbiassed researches object. 

This polygon for possible researches extends (even at present familiar - with verifiable modern 
experiments – physical world) many tens orders: downwards - deep into Matter in subatomic world 
and hill up - in world of extreme – large astronomical systems. 

In  this  connection  the  fundamental  (in  definite  sense  -  epistemological  or  metaphysical) 

statement of WU Concept is imply following:

The Assertion (Hierarchy Ad Infinitum)  
There is No limit of Hierarchy (of Staircase of Matter). 
This extreme brief statement, at least, does not limit by dogmas the horizon of a cosmology of 

the Future, does not bar creative, search tendencies of the explorers. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 

The Standard Model of a modern cosmology does not test the special doubts that the Universe 
"As a whole" ("All Universe" - in the issue) is homoheneitic and is isotropic. But the impartial and 
critical  analysis  demonstrates,  that  such  reliance,  mainly,  reposes  on  formerly  none-critically 
adopted by the fathers-founders (of modern cosmology) postulates, and later - it is already simple 
– on tradition of following to authorities, habit, mode. 

The scandalous gap with observed properties of the actual Universe is eliminated by the ad hoc 
confirmation that nevertheless at a definite stage in time and space the Universe (why?) ceases to  
be  homogeneous  and  therefore  appear  reference  observed  features  an  actual  hierarchic  world  - 
the world of atoms, planetary, star galactic systems. 

The Wave Universe Concept tumbles this model and puts it from a head on legs, first of all, - on 
the  apparent,  fundamental  observational  basis.  The  observed  Hierarchy  of  Levels  of  Matter 
extends  many  tens  orders  and  there  are  no  visible  causes,  by  virtue  of  which  one  this  hierarchy 
should  interrupt  at  any  Level  of  Matter.  You  see  then  it  will  be  special,  really  physically 
distinguished  Level  of  Matter.  Here  again  not  only  it  is  desirable,  but  it  is  necessary  to  result 
extremely  severe,  nontrivial,  convincing  physical  arguments, by virtue of which one the so series 
universal property of hierarchy of Universe is for some reason upset. 

Moreover,  the  Wave  Universe  Concept  indicates  the  causes,  circumstances,  arguments,  by 
virtue of which one the phenomenon of Hierarchy is an indispensable, natural consequent of some 
more  fundamental  laws  of  nature.  Briefly  speaking,  the  observed  Hierarchy  of  the  Universe  is  to 
straight lines a consequent of a Wave (Megawave) constitution of the actual Universe, consequent 
that  it  is  grandiose  composition  of  the  enclosed  Wave  dynamic  systems  (WDS)  at  all  Levels  of 
Staircase of Matter. 

Thus the immanent wave (megawave) properties spontaneously and directly are connected to 
properties of quantization (including, and quantization "in the Large"), commensurability (as inside 
WDS, and between them - at miscellaneous Levels of Matter) and, thus - with properties and laws 
of Hierarchy. 

In  order  to  prevent  barren  loss  of  time  and  efforts,  cosmologists,  which  one  with  the  tight 
attention prolong to expect approach of epoch of total homogeneity and isotropy of the Universe, it 
is necessary to advise - more often to recall astern wisdom: "If you very wait for the friend, do not 
accept knocking the heart for stamp of hoofs of his horse".

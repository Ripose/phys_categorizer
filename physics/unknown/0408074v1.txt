Abstract

One  of  our  two  methods  for  fast-neutron  imaging  with  spectrometric  capability  is  presented  here.  It  is  a  neutron-counting
technique based on a hydrogenous neutron converter coupled to Gaseous Electron Multipliers (GEM). The principles of the
detection techniques and the optimization of the converter, electron amplification and the readout are described. Evaluation of
the properties are derived from a experiment in a pulsed neutron beam of spectral distribution between 2 and 10 MeV.

1. Introduction

Recently we have reported about the development
of two imaging methods for Fast-Neutron Resonance
Transmission  Radiography  (FNRT)  [1,2].  In  our
approach  to  this  technology  a  pulsed,  broad  energy
neutron  beam  is  produced  by  a  nanosecond  pulsed
deuterium  beam  hitting  a  thick  Be  target.  Selected
for  element
neutron-energy  windows, 
identification in a sample, are selected by Time-Of-

relevant 

Flight  (TOF)  techniques.  The  most  challenging
feature  in  this  approach  is  the  requirement  of
efficient,  large  area  neutron  imaging  detectors  with
nanosecond  timing  capability.  In  our  earlier  articles
we  have  proposed  and  demonstrated  the  capabilities
of  different  detector  concepts.  One  is  a  pulse-
counting  detector  based  on  a  hydrogenous  neutron
converter coupled to a position-sensitive gas detector.
The  second  one  is  based  on  a  fast  plastic  scintillator
screen  viewed  by  a  nanosecond-gated  fast  framing
camera  or  several  independently  gated  intensified
CCD cameras. The third method uses the  scintillator
based  optical  system  but  the  gated  intensifier  is

with  sub-nanosecond  timing  capability.  All  these

The  earlier  status  in  the  development  of  these
detectors and our neutron facility is presented in [1].
A short report on recent developments of the imaging
systems  can  be  found  in  [2].  This  paper  focuses  on
the  description  of  the  pulse  counting  gas  detector

method  and  the  technical  realisation  of  one  module.

A  detailed  description  and  evaluation    of  the  optical
systems will be published elsewhere.

2. The Detector

2.1 The FANGAS concept
The  first  step  in  neutron  detection  is  the  efficient
conversion  of  neutrons 
into  energetic  charged
particles  which  can  be  detected  by  established
methods  due  to  their  light  or  electric  charge  carrier
production.  In  earlier  work  we  have  reported  on  the
development  of  a  thermal  neutron  imaging  methods
based on solid foil Gd and  6Li neutron converters [3-
6]. The method is based on detecting electrons or ions
from  neutron  interactions  in  a  converter  foil.  These
particles  can  escape  into  a  gas  and  are  detected  by
one or several position sensitive wire chambers. With
this  method  thermal  neutron  detectors  with  about  25
%  detection  efficiency,  sub-millimeter  position
resolution  and  about  100  ns  time  resolution  were
realized.  In  FANGAS,  this  method  is  developed
further  to  satisfy  the  needs  for  application  in  fast-
neutron resonance radiography in pulsed beams. The
goals  for  the  detectors  in  this  application  can  be
summarized as follows:
-  Detection area:  > 30x30 cm2
-  Detection efficiency: > 5 %
- 
Insensitivity to gamma-rays
-  Count rate  capability > 106
- 
-  Energy resolution:  < 500 keV at 8 MeV
- 
Position resolution (fwhm): 0,5 mm

Spectroscopic properties  in 2-10 MeV range

Because  fast  neutron  cross  section  are  only  of  the
order  of  a  few  bn  (compared  to  thousands  to
hundreds  of  thousand  kbn  at  thermal  energies),  the
conversion  efficiency  of  the  best  neutron  to  charge
particle  converters  for  MeV  neutrons  are  much
smaller.  Therefore,  to  achieve  detection  efficiencies
of  5  %,  individual  detectors  modules  have  to  be
cascaded  along  the  beam  axis.  This  was  already
proposed for the  thermal neutron detector based on a
6Li  converter  foil  to  achieve  higher  efficiencies  [6].
For  fast  neutrons  about  25  modules  are  needed,
which  necessitates  to  develop  techniques  for  simple
and  rugged  construction  and  handling,  to  minimize
trained  person
production  cost  and 
involvement during operation.

2.2 The detection method
Fig. 1 shows the principle of the detection method. In
the converter stage neutrons scatter with protons in a
hydrogen  rich  radiator  foil,  made  of  polypropylene
(PP)  or  polyethylene  (PE).  Protons  can  escape  from
the  foil  into  an  the  adjacent  0,5  -  1  mm  wide  gas
filled  conversion  gap  of  an  electron  multiplier.  Here
the  protons  produce  ionisation  electrons  which  are
collected  and  multiplied  by  3  cascaded  Gas  Electron
Multipliers (GEMs) [7]. After leaving the last GEM,
the  amplified  electron  cloud  travels  through  the
induction  gap  and  is  finally  collected  on  an  anode.
This  anode  is  a  thin  film  of  high  surface  resistivity,
deposited  on  an  insulating  substrate.  Through  this
layer the moving charge in the induction gap induces
a  signal  on  a  readout  (RO)  board  behind  the

insulating  substrate.    The  readout  board  is  a  double
layer  printed  circuit  board  (PCB)  which  contains  on
both  sides a pad  structure for position encoding. The
position  read  out  is  obtained  by  the  delay  line
technique.

2.3 The proton radiator
The  neutron  radiator  is  optimized  to  satisfy  2
conflicting requirements:
a)  neutrons  have  to  interact  with  radiator  material
and  produce  energetic  charged  particles.  This
emphasizes thick converters with large neutron cross
sections.
b) the charged particles must reach the surface of the
foil and escape into the gas volume. This favors thin
foils  as  well  as  reactions  where  the  secondary
particles are of low Z (e.g. protons) and where these
particles  receive  high  kinetic  energy.  Furthermore,
materials  of 
(dE/dx)  are
low  stopping  power 
preferable.
The  best  radiator  candidates  are  hydrocarbon  foils,
where the neutron scatters elastically with hydrogen.
PE and PP were chosen because they are easy to use
and  have  the  largest  hydrogen  content  of  all  plastic
foils.  Since  the  converter  in  the  detector  has  also  to
act as electrode the converter was coated with a thin
layer of graphite.
The  parameters  of  the  neutron  radiator  and  the  ion
converter  are  estimated  and  optimized  by  simulating
the neutronics and the charged particle transport with
GEANT  [8].  The  details  and  the  results  of  these
simulations  are  published  elsewhere 
this
proceedings  [9].  For  our  detector,  designed  for
energies  between  2  and  10  MeV,  a  1  mm  converter
thickness was chosen which provides for 2  MeV and
7,5  MeV  neutrons  a  detection  efficiency  of  0,05  %
and 0,2 % respectively.
The physical limit of the position resolution, defined
by the point spread function (PSF), is also calculated
in  [9].  Protons  escape  from  the  radiator  surface  into
the  conversion  gap  at  various  angles.  The  detected
position  of  these  protons  is  assumed  to  be  in  the
middle  of  the  proton  track  inside  the1  mm  wide
conversion  gap.  The  distribution  of  these  positions
for  a  neutron  beam  of  infinitesimal  small  size  is
assumed  to  define  the  ideal  PSF.  For  the  relevant
energy range from 2 – 10 MeV  a fwhm resolution of
0,5  -  1  mm  can  be  achieved.  Because  this  is  the
the  subsequent  charged  particle
physical 

limit, 

in 

3

detection  and    read  out    techniques  have  to  provide
only  this  level  of  accuracy  and  can  be  designed
accordingly.

2.4. Ion conversion and electron amplification
The proton, after escaping form the radiator, enters a
1  mm  wide  gas  filled  conversion  gap  where  it
produces electrons by ionising the gas molecules. For
convenience  we  used  a  standard  gas  mixture  for
GEM  operation,    Ar  (70  %)  and  CO2  (30%)  at  a
pressure of 1 bar. The number or electrons produced
by protons in the relevant energy range of 100 keV –
10  MeV  ranges  from  about  200  to  4000  in  a  1  mm
gap (energy loss calculated by SRIM[10]). The width
of  the  conversion  gap  is  a  compromise  between  the
need  of  a  thin  gap  for  obtaining  the  highest  position
resolution  and  the  difficulty  of  manufacturing  thin
parallel  gaps  in  large  area  detectors.  The  ionisation
electrons  are  efficiently  amplified  by  3  cascaded
GEMs  made  by  the  CERN  group  [7].  For  the
prototype  module  we  have  used  10  by  10  cm  square
GEMs  on  70  m m  thick  Kapton, with  ˘ 80  m m  holes
and 140  m m pitch. The detector electrodes are biased
via a resistor network  with equal voltage steps on all
GEMs  and  in  between  them.  Sufficient  gain  is
obtained  at  about  405  V  on  each  GEM.  The  voltage
in  the  conversion  gap  is  individually  adjustable  to
optimize for maximum collection efficiency (at about
150  V).  The  voltage  across  the  induction  gap
(between  the  last  GEM  and  the  collection  anode)  is
raised  to  twice  the  value  of  the  GEM  voltage  to
ensure  efficient  charge  transfer  and  rapid  charge
collection  on  the  anode.  The  width  of  the  induction
gap  was  varied  between  1  and  3  mm  and  the
influence  on  the  signal  shape  and  amplitude  at  the
pickup  electrodes  was  studied  (see  also  [11]).  The
best  results  were  obtained  at  1  mm  where  signal
duration matched the time constant of the delay lines
and  preamplifiers,  and  the  amplitude  was  at  its
maximum.

2.5.  Resistive  anode  and  signal  induction  on
redout electrode
For  position  readout,  the  method  of  induced  signal
readout  (RO)  through  a  resistive  anode  was  chosen
[12-16].  This  method  has  the  following  advantages
compared  to  the  direct  readout  on  a  pad  or  strip
structured anode:

4

a)  spread  of  the  geometrical  size  of  the  induced
signal:
the  small  radial  size  of  the  final  avalanche  cloud  is
frequently  a  problem  when  using  GEMs  at
atmospheric  pressure.  Applying  an  interpolating  RO
method  (delayline,  wedge-and-strip...)  the  readout
structures have to be either very small (of the order of
100  m m)  or  the  induction  gap  must  be  sufficiently
wide to enable radial diffusion of the avalanche. The
induced  charge  method  allows  the  use  of  a    2  mm
pitch  on  the  RO  structure  with  a  only  1  mm  wide
induction gap.
b) galvanic decoupling of detector and RO board:
The  resistive  anode  can  be  operated  at  high  voltage
while the RO board is at ground potential.
c) protection of RO circuits:
electrical  discharges  in  the  detector  do  not  damage
the 
the
electromagnetic  shock  is  limited  by  the  small  serial
capacitance between anode and RO board.
To maximize the signal amplitude on the RO we have
investigated  several  resistive  anode  coatings.  The
requirements are:
a)  maximum signal on the RO boards
b) 
c)

because 

Vacuum  deposited  Ge  layers  and  sprayed  graphite
paints [16] of different thicknesses were investigated.
A  signal  transmission  of  100  %  was  achieved  with
Ge  at  surface  resistivities  of  30  –  500  MW
(cid:144) .  The
sprayed  anodes  were  of  1  –  5  MW
  and  their
transmission  ranged  from  50  –  85  %.  Due  to  their
simple deposition technique and their proven stability
during  operation  the  graphite  anodes  are  the  first
choice  for  a  future  multi-element  detector,  despite
their lower signal transparency.

 

2.6. The read out electrode
The  position  signals  are  derived  from  a  pad-
structured  RO  electrode  which  was  proposed    by
Jagutzki et al.[12]. Fig 2 shows a schematic drawing
of  the  RO  board.  Pads  for  X  and  Y  coordinates  are
printed  on  both  sides  of  a  standard,  0,5  mm  thick
PCB  and  are 
in
interconnected  by 
orthogonal  directions.  The  pads  on  both  sides  are
to  minimize

capacitive  coupling,  which  is  responsible  for  a  non-
localized  component  in  the  output  signals  (e.g.  see
the  “precursor  signal”  in  a  delay  line  readout  (fig.  7
in [17]).

to “X” - delay lines

Fig. 2:  Schematic view of a section of the RO electrode with the
black (grey) pads in the front (back) side for recording of the “X”

coordinates.

The  position  information  is  encoded  by  discrete  LC-
delay lines of 1,25  ns/mm mounted on the RO board
using  SMD.  This  is  a  simple  and  inexpensive
technique,  which  can  handle  up  to  106  events  /s,
provided a capable electronic RO and data processing
system  is  available.  The  presently  available  low  cost
system,  based  on  the  F1-TDC  and  ATMD  board  of
ACAM  electronics  [18]  can  handle  about  105  s-1  per
5
module.

shows  the  result  of  measurements  with  several
electrodes,  each  with  a  different  area  ratios,  covered
by the pads on front (Af) and backside(Ab).
Another  important  factor  is  the  radial  charge  spread.
To  obtain  the  highest  position  resolution  without
modulations  in  the  position  response  by  the  periodic
RO  structure,  the  radial  spread  the  induced  charge
should be close to the pitch of the RO structure. This
pitch is the spacing between the pads, i.e. 2 mm. The
radial  width  of  the  induced  charge  is  determined
mainly  by  the  distance  between  the  resistive  anode
and the RO board.

3. Neutron Radiography with FANGAS

3.1. Energy resolution of FANGAS
FANGAS  was  developed  for  energy  selective  fast
neutron  radiography  by  measuring  neutron  TOF  in
pulsed  beams.  The  method  and  setup  for  this
experiment  at  PTB  is  described  in  [1].  A  pulsed,
broad spectrum neutron beam is produced by 13 MeV
deuterium  beam  pulses  of  1,5  ns  width,    hitting  a
thick  Be  target.  The  Be  target  is  enclosed  by  a
collimator  which  restricts  the  neutron  beam  to
neutrons scattered into forward directions and defines
a  neutron  field  of  appropriate  size.  The  integral
neutron flux at 3 m distance is 2 – 4 ·

The  black  curve  shows  the  carbon  cross  section

From  the  two  energy  spectra  in  fig.  5  the  energy
dependent  transmission  through  the  8  cm  graphite
block is calculated and compared with the theoretical
transmission  probability.  In 
the
contribution  of  scattered  neutrons    from  the  sample
can  be  neglected  because  of  the  distance  of  2,6  m
between  C  block    and  detector.  Below  5  MeV  the
calculation is in good accordance with the experiment
–  apart  of  the  sharp  resonances,  which  of  course
cannot be resolved by this method.

significant.  The  reason  is  the  rather  poor  time
resolution of the FANGAS with   D

neutron  flight  path  of  3  m  this  corresponds  to  a
energy  resolution  of    D Efwhm  =  240  and  850  keV
(fwhm) at En = 3 and 7  MeV respectively (see black
bars in Fig 6).

An improvement of the time resolution to about 2 ns,
which  is  close  to  the  limit  of  the  accelerator  time
resolution,  is  desirable  and  should  be  possible  with
this kind detector.

3.2. Position Resolution of FANGAS
The  position  resolution  of  FANGAS  was  measured
with  a  step-wedge  mask  made  of  polyvinyltoluene
(NE102  plastic  scintillator  material).  The  mask
consists  of  a  set  of  leaves  with  thickness  ranging
from  1  –  10  mm.    Their  length  in  beam  direction
ranges from 7 – 60 mm (see fig. 7). Fig. 8 shows the
image  of  the  step  wedge  in  the  neutron  beam,
obtained with the full neutron spectrum.
To  calculate  the  position  resolution,  for  2  step  sizes,
40 and 60 mm, the projections to the horizontal axis
are  calculated.  (see  white  boxes  fig.  8  and  fig  9  as
example  for  a  projection  of  the  60  mm  step).  From
these  histograms  the  position  resolution  of  the
detector is calculated, assuming that the point spread
function (PSF) of the detector is of Gaussian shape.

Fig 8 Neutron image of the step wedge mask. The small images at
the right are:  top:flat field,  center:  raw  image,  bottom:  processed
image  (flat-field  correction).  The  white  boxes  mark  two  areas
which are analysed to derive the position resolution (see fig. 9)

The  image  is  then  a  convolution  of  the  rectangular
mask  and  the  PSF  of  the  detector.  The  width  of  the
Gaussian  PSF 
is  determined  using  Bayesian
parameter  estimation  [19].  For  the  calculation,  the
program WinBUGS [20] was used.
From  the  histograms  of  the  60    and  40  mm  long
leaves, the width of the PSF was determined to be s 60
=  0,45  (– 0,03)  and  s 40  =  0,43  – 0,03  mm  (fwhm  =
1,00  /  1,06  mm).  Fig.  9  shows  the  measured  (dots)
and the MC simulated data for the 60 mm leaves.

Two  images  are  selected,  measured  at  energies
marked  as  ON  and  OFF  in  fig.  5  and  fig  11a.
Dividing  both  images  pixel-by-pixel  is  expected  to
result  in  a  new  image  where  the  steel  is  eliminated
and only the carbon samples remain visible.
For  this  measurement  each  registered  neutron  event
was  stored  in  list-mode,  thus  maintaining  the  full
correlation between position and TOF.  The  ON-  and
OFF-resonance  images  were  then  reconstructed  off-
line  according  to  the  appropriate  TOF  windows  (see
fig. 11a), corresponding to the energy windows in fig.
7. The images with condition ON and OFF resonance
are  shown  in  fig  11.  The  resulting  image,  after
dividing  ON-  and  OFF-resonance  images  pixel-by-
pixel  is  shown  in  fig.11R.  As  expected,  the  steel
wrench disappears in the R image; however, also the
thinner  carbon  samples  cannot  be  resolved  anymore.
This poor contrast in the ratio image is not only due
to  the  limited  counting  statistics  in  the  raw  images
but mainly due to the poor time resolution (see fig. 5)
which reduces the effect of the pronounced difference
in  neutron  transmission  between  ON  and  OFF
resonance.

3.3. Resonance Imaging with Carbon
The  resonance  imaging  method  was  tested  on  a
composite  sample  made  of  carbon  rods  and  a  steel
wrench  (see  fig.  10a,b).  The  setup  of  detector  and
sample  is  shown  in  10c.  Fig.  10d  shows  the  integral
(i.e.  all  energies)  neutron  image  after  flat  field
correction. In the energy range between 6 and 8 MeV
the  neutron  cross  section  for  steel 
is  without
significant  variations  [21]  while  carbon  shows  broad
structures (see fig. 5).

4. Conclusion and Outlook

We have presented a pulse-counting neutron imaging
detector  with  TOF  capability  and  demonstrated  its
performance in a fast neutron resonance radiography
experiment.  At  present  we  are  developing  a  module
with  an  active  area  of  30x30  cm2  based  on
established  GEM  techniques.  This  detector  will  be
the  prototype  for  a  cascade  of  25  identical  modules,
stacked  along  the  beam  axis  in  order  to  achieve  a
total detection efficiency of about 5 %.

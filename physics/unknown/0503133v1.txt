Recently, we showed that band, as well as line spectra reveal a left-right symmetry in 4- and 2-fermion 

systems. We now show how a mass-conjugation explains the difference between atom- and antiatom states of a 

stable 2-unit charge Coulomb system. For the electron-proton system in natural H, this difference (an anomaly) 

between states belonging to the hydrogen (matter) world and the antihydrogen (antimatter) anti-world is governed by 

number 2me/mH= 0.0011. This is verified with the H line spectrum. Classical physics can describe the parity 

effects for matter-antimatter asymmetry. An internal mass-conjugation (internal algebra) extends and generalizes 

Dirac’s fermion-anti-fermion symmetry and defies Einstein’s Special Theory of Relativity (STR).

1. Introduction 

 

 

 

One can never overestimate the importance of the H line spectrum to understand the laws of 

nature. Atomic 2-fermion system H played a decisive role in the development of quantum theory 

and is important for metrology [1]. Today, many years after Bohr theory, only bound state QED 

[2], based on Dirac-Einstein theories in a Coulomb field, can account for this line spectrum with great 

precision (errors < 10-11). Similarly, molecule H2 and its band spectrum is the only benchmark available 

for neutral, stable 4-fermion Coulomb systems. Today, we understand the H2 band spectrum only 

with Schrödinger wave-mechanics-based Heitler-London theory, published in 1927 [3]. 

 

Despite the achievements of these 2 complex theoretical frameworks for benchmark 

systems H and H2, problems persist with the chiral behavior of neutral particles. Matter-antimatter 

(a)symmetry, a mirror or left-right (a)symmetry (a parity) and its implicit mass-conjugation are 

important for unification. Particle-antiparticle symmetry for charge-conjugated particles (fermions) goes back to 

Dirac theory. Although with charged particles, charge conjugation is sufficient to arrive at mirror 

symmetry (parity, inversion), the problem is more difficult when neutral composite particles are 

involved, since mass-conjugation is not evident between 2 neutral positive mass particles. There is a 

Babel of Tongues for matter-antimatter (a)symmetry [4]. This is the broader context of this report: the 

morphological (bio-) diversity in nature suggests chiral behavior is a generic property of matter.

Using the molecular band spectrum of H2, we recently found [5] that atom-antiatom symmetry 

really exists. To make sense, a single atom must show this very same symmetry: a natural atom H 

must be able to take the morphology of a classical atomic- as well as that of an anti-atomic-state. The 

unavoidable consequence -the challenge- of [5] was to detect atom- and antiatom-states by means 

of an atomic line spectrum. We showed [6,7,9] that such a spectrum points towards intra-atomic left-

right or mirror symmetry also, exactly as we anticipated [5]. Using QED one-electron energies for Lyman ns-

singlet states [8], algebraic effects on a left-right transition in the neutral, bound and stable 2-unit charge Coulomb 

system in H are easily exposed quantitatively [6,7,9]. These unprecedented results [5-7,9] are not directly 

visible in the 2 complex theoretical frameworks available: bound state QED [2] for atom H and 

Heitler-London theory [3] for molecule H2. 

In addition, using conventional Heitler-London theory it is still difficult to assess the 

stability of a hydrogen-antihydrogen or HH complex [10-16]. One suspects (atom-antiatom) 

annihilation but it remains difficult to tell exactly how stable 4-fermion HH is, if it were stable at all. 

This is surprising, since similar 4-fermion HH system in H2 and its band spectrum can be described 

quite exactly [17,18]. 

Recent results [5-7,9] defy 2 standard theories. So, mirror symmetry at the neutral particle 

level must be reassessed. Normally, we take most of its implications (inversion in 1D) for granted or 

consider them as trivial, since a right-handed reference frame in front of a mirror (plane) is 

transformed into a left-handed one behind the mirror (plane). As detailed in [9], much depends on 

the position of a mirror (plane): is it external or internal with respect to left- and right-handed 

objects? Is an observer situated in- or outside the system exhibiting chiral behavior [9]? The mirror 

image of a real object in front of a real mirror is an exact but differently handed copy of that object. 

Seen in the mirror, the object is imaginary or virtual and cannot be observed in the world of external 

observers. In this case, a real mirror is placed outside a real object, whatever its absolute handedness, 

which is inverted in the virtual object seen in (or behind) a mirror (plane). This case suggests mirror 

symmetry is a discrete and virtual symmetry. 

 

For two real objects, left-/right-handed, say left and right hands, it only appears there is a mirror in 

between. In reality, there is no mirror, since the details of a left hand are different than those of a right hand. With 2 

real objects, differently handed, the mirror in between does not really exist since there is left-right

asymmetry. This difference in the details of real left- and right-handed objects can never be reflected 

in a real mirror1, which is at the roots of chiral behavior as observed in nature [9]. The picture gets more 

explicit realizing that also a hand’s front and back are differently handed. The differences, the asymmetry, 

between front and back of a hand are much larger than those between the fronts or backs of a left 

and a right hand, indicating that there are gradations in chiral behavior or that mirror symmetry is not just a 

discrete and virtual symmetry, since it can also be continuous and real. There is no real mirror plane within a 

hand, despite the left-right topology of front and back, since chiral behavior or a left-right asymmetry has 

taken over. Mathematical, physical and chemical effects of chiral behavior are given in [9].  

 

Trying to measure a difference between atom and anti-atom energies is a goal of current 

CERN/Fermilab antihydrogen experiments [19]. For the CPT-theorem, the value of the 1S-2S-

transition in H is critical. But, if left-right (a)symmetry is fundamental for neutral particle systems 

observed in nature and if neutral species H is their benchmark, there must be a connection between 

the H spectrum and a mirror (a)symmetry. Taking the above hand metaphor, we expect that back 

and front versions of atom H -whatever these stand for- are different. This is exactly what we already 

found: an intra-atomic mirror symmetry [5-7,9]. But in the advent of unification, this mirror (a)symmetry must 

ultimately be understood with algebraic mass effects (mass-conjugation) with 2 masses on a single axis (the field). 

In [5-7,9] we used a phenomenological approach to mirror symmetry at the neutral particle 

level, the atom. In this report, we try to expose the rationale behind these phenomena and to focus 

on the existence of and the transition between 2 mass-conjugated worlds, a matter and an anti-matter 

To get at a chiral field effect for the electron-proton interaction in H, we must find a mass-

conjugation, whatever its nature, in a single world, i.e. the real world where all of our observations are 

2. Matter-antimatter asymmetry 

The 2 mass-conjugated worlds are: a matter-world, were particles (neutral or charged, 

fermions or bosons) have positive mass and an antimatter-world, where these particles have negative 

mass. This is just a uni-axial 1D representation of matter-antimatter symmetry like for algebraic

numbers on an axis [9]. As in previous reports [6,7,9], we use standard Bohr 1/n2 theory as a 

guideline for detecting matter-antimatter (a)symmetry at the atomic level, not bound state QED, 

where fermion spin (helicity) accounts for chiral effects [2]. A point-like particle with positive mass 

(matter, right…) in front of a real mirror (an inversion point, an origin of an axis) is inverted into a 

virtual point-like antiparticle with negative mass (antimatter, left…) [9]. We can use a parity operator 

P for particle mass m, giving eventually (-1)Pm or +m for P=0 and –m for P=1, exactly the parity 

operator for algebraic numbers on an axis. 

 

To make the approach generic, we use a zero mass perturbation of hydrogen mass, as H is the 

prototype of a bound 2-unit charge system [9]. In this 1D view, static atom H in a positive matter 

world has energy 

E(+)/c2 = +mH 

E(-)/c2 = - mH 

Anti-hydrogen atom H in a negative antimatter world has energy 

 

 

 

Mass |mH | is equal in both worlds and c is the velocity of light.  

Which world is actually designed as positive or negative and which of the two is the real world, depends on 

convention. The (mass-) exclusion principle is that a negative (positive) mass particle is forbidden in the positive 

(negative) mass world. We correlate signs of mass and energy, although, conventionally, mass and energy 

are conjugated (positive mass atoms have negative total energy).  

When a zero mass perturbation is applied to atom H, mass mH is left unaltered, whatever its 

sign. Despite its simplicity (the justification is given below), this model leads to pertinent results, 

significant to get a matter-antimatter (a)symmetry and a mass-conjugation.  

The model with ±mH is a substitute for a symmetrical achiral division (bisection) of mass mH in 

2 halves +½mH and -½mH, centered at a local origin (the scale factor is 1 for 2 species and ½ for 1 

species only), a description for which a negative world is allowed. A mathematical metaphor for a zero mass 

perturbation is that a positive number +1000 can be described as an average of 2 positive numbers 

like +999 and +1001. We use a local origin at +1000 and 2 auxiliary numbers +1 and –1 (the known 

measure or unit for numbers) at either side of this local origin [9]. Without perturbation, the alternative 

for achiral division (bisection) is to describe positive number +1000 as a line segment with vertices –

500 and +500 centered at a common local zero origin (but situated at +500 in the absolute reference

frame). The analogy between the algebra of pure numbers and that of physical numbers (i.e. scaled 

zero-dimensional physical parameters like m/m0), including the case of complex numbers, is dealt 

with in detail in [9]. 

 

The physical justification for using a zero mass perturbation is simple. We can only study H by 

perturbing it with heat (kT), radiation (hν)…. Its effect can be estimated by comparing energies in 

unperturbed and perturbed systems. Perturbed H has energy: [EH+kT], [EH+hν] or [EH+hc/λ]. 

Using EH=mHc2, we have EH(pert) = EH[1+ kT/(mHc2)]. Reduced perturbation kT/(mHc2) is an 

extremely small number, even at high temperatures. With twice the Rydberg or reduced mass as 

alternative unit energy E’H for H (µα2c2 instead of mHc2), this ratio is 108 times larger (~ 10-5T/°). 

As a generalization, the algebraic effect of a very small perturbation, a generic zero mass perturbation, on a 

system like H with mass mH is of crucial importance. How to scale the corresponding energies is 

another problem. With reduced mass for instance, the matter-antimatter worlds are rescaled to give  

E/(αc)2(±)=±µ  

instead of absolute E/c2(±)=±mH. A reduced mass scale is the basis of the present analysis (see also 

[9]). Scale factor α2 is not relevant for the algebra (symmetry) of the worlds. 

The example with numbers +999, +1000 and +1001 illustrates the possibility that 

gradations in chiral behavior are also plausible. Standard unit difference +1 between numbers N and N+1 

becomes less visible with increasing N. Their ratio 1/(1+1/N) is 1 only for infinite N. 

The world-antiworld unitary symmetry (or the algebra of numbers [9]) is perfectly 

understood with mathematics. The problem of mirror symmetry for the non-algebraic, exclusively positive 

numbers in physics (of type p/q, where p and q are measured quantities having the same dimension) is 

to verify if mirrored systems or left-right transitions in nature/physics are virtual (forbidden) or real 

(allowed).

where p is an unknown number (integer or not, large or small, variable or not). The value of p does

A generic zero mass perturbation of one (neutral) particle with positive mass as in (1) always gives 3 

particles instead of one, of which 1 must have negative mass, which is, by definition, forbidden in a positive mass 

world. At generic level (1) of a possible chiral theory, there is no need to introduce fields, dynamics or any other 

physics: only algebraic number theory (real or complex, see below and [9]) is involved.   The conflict with 

negative mass particle –mx in a positive mass world in (1) can be solved in 2 ways: (a) a 

conventional one and (b), a solution which defies convention. 

 

 

(a) Classical or conventional Bohr solution in a +world 

When Bohr said that, in the conventional positive matter-world, atom H consists of an 

electron with positive mass me and a proton with positive mass Mp, he actually proposed to 

interpret algebraic mass equation (1), without speaking of charges, literally as follows 

+mH=+mH±0=+mH-(mx1-mx2)=+(mH-mx1)+mx2=+(mH-me)+me =+Mp+me   (3) 

with |me|<|Mp| and mxn=me (p=1). With the number metaphor, Bohr here said that positive 

number +1000 ≡ +1000-1+1≡ +999 +1. The appearance of a negative mass particle -me in a 

positive mass world is avoided, as it should. Unit –1 cannot belong to a positive number world. Bohr let 

particle mass -me be absorbed in a heavier one with positive mass mH-me=Mp: only the internal sign of 

the composite particle is negative in the positive mass world, its external sign remains positive as 

Mp>me. Up to this level, the analogy with algebraic number theory (Dirac’s particle-antiparticle 

symmetry) is evident, if it were not for the algebra within the composite baryon, the proton. The 

notion of conjugated algebraic charges for the remaining 2 particles is not even necessary.

However, classical physics is involved for describing the interaction between the 2 remaining 

particles with mass Mp and me. To get at a soluble pseudo 1-particle system, Bohr had to proceed 

classically with a reduced mass for the 2-particle combination in (3). With (1) as our basis for a 

chiral field theory and without having to consider particle charges at this instance, we get a reduced mass with 

2 sign characteristics instead of only one: 

(i) the first is external: + for the world (the classical Dirac mirror symmetry) 

(ii) the second is internal: – for the composite particle, needed to arrive at its positive mass.  

As stated above, also reduced mass in a +world must be positive but must be described 

with external E and internal I algebra (E,I), giving µ(E,I). Using (3), the result is 

µ1(+,-)=me(mH-me)/mH=me(1-me/mH)=µBohr=meMp/(Mp+me)=me/(1+me/Mp)   (4) 

indistinguishable from the original Bohr result with me and Mp directly.  

In the present context, we obtain nevertheless an algebraic reformulation of Bohr’s reduced mass 

µ1(+,-)=µBohr. 

(b) Non-conventional mass distribution in a +world. 

Using (1), an alternative distribution of the 3 particle masses in (1) is possible. Instead of 

(3), we obtain the mathematically perfectly allowed mass redistribution 

+mH=+mH±0=+mH+(mx1-mx2)=+(mH+mx1)-mx2 =+(mH+me)-me 

(5) 

for the same zero mass perturbation. This distribution is forbidden in the positive mass world since one of 

the 2 remaining particles of interest retains its negative mass. With the number metaphor, we say that 

+1000≡+1000+1-1≡+1001-1. If classical physics were involved here too, we can calculate a reduced 

mass for this forbidden system using the same procedure as above. We obtain 

µ2(+,+)=-me(mH+me)/mH=-me(1+me/mH) =-me(1+2me/Mp)/(1+me/Mp)   (6) 

still without speaking about particle charges. 

This second interpretation (5) of a zero mass perturbation for mH is forbidden in the positive mass world, since 

reduced mass (6) is negative. It can only be allowed in the negative mass or anti-matter world. Forbidden reduced 

mass (6) correlates with allowed one (4) as 

µ2(+,+)/µ1(+,-) = -(1+2me/Mp)   

 

 

 

 

(7a)

These two reduced masses do not only have a different external sign (are externally conjugated in the 

Dirac sense) but there is also a (small) difference in magnitude, due to a different internal sign. The anomaly 

introduced by means of an algebraic switch in a zero mass perturbation mH (1) is 2me/Mp (7a) for 

the ratio and 2me/mH for the difference. Let us rewrite (7a) in terms of hydrogen mass. With 

Mp=mH-me, we obtain 

1+2me/Mp= (mH+me)/(mH-me)=(1+me/mH)/(1-me/mH)  

 

(7b) 

which is asymmetrical in classical recoil me/Mp but algebraically symmetrical in a hydrogen mass based 

version of classical recoil me/mH [9b]. Internal mass remains conjugated, an extension absent in 

Dirac particle-antiparticle theory based on external algebra only. Classical external mirror symmetry is 

associated with a parity operator (conjugation) for algebraic numbers [9]. 

The number metaphor is illustrative: a physical approach to +1000 says that, in a +world, 

approximation +999+1 is allowed but approximation +1001-1 is forbidden, according to the world-antiworld 

distinction. 

We must now verify what happens if a zero mass perturbation were applied to -mH. 

2.2. Generic zero mass perturbation of antiatom H in a negative anti-matter world 

Zero mass perturbation of antihydrogen H with mass -mH must be written as 

-mH=-mH±0=-mH±(mx1-mx2) 

 

 

 

 

 

(8) 

which differs from (1) only by the external sign of mass mH, a trivial result. The internal sign of the 

perturbing mass-system is unaffected. Using the metaphor above, we discuss number –1000 for 

which we have symmetrical descriptions –999 -1 and –1001+1, where only -1 is the (known) unit for 

negative numbers. 

Using (2) and the same conventions as in Section 2.1, it is easily verified, without giving 

details, that 2 reduced masses are also obtained in the antiworld. The third in the series is 

µ3(-,-)=(-me)[-(mH-me)]/(-mH)=(-me)[-(mH-me)]/(-mH)=-me(1-me/mH)=-me/(1+me/Mp)   (9) 

equal to -µ1(+,-) or (4). This is simply the negative of the Bohr reduced mass, allowed in the negative world.  

µ4(-,+)=me[-(mH+me)]/(-mH)=me(mH+me)/mH=me(1+me/mH)=me(1+2me/Mp)/(1+me/Mp) (10) 

Finally, the fourth reduced mass is 

equal to -µ2(+,+) or (6). As in (7a), we obtain 

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 8 

 

 

 

 

 

 

µ4(-,+)/µ3(-,-) = - (1+2me/Mp) 

 

 

 

 

 

(11) 

identical with (7a) and reproducing result (7b). 

 

Third reduced mass (9) is allowed in the anti-matter world and forbidden in the matter world. Fourth (10) 

is forbidden in the anti-matter world but is allowed in the matter world. This is a mathematical consequence of 

trying to describe a neutral boson (mH) as a neutral 2-fermion system as Bohr did in his model for 

atom H. The result from this analysis is that in a positive matter world (the Bohr world for H), 

mass mH is forced to get an external algebraic sign, which finally reflects the internal symmetry of 

the 2-fermion Coulomb system with 2-unit charges, which we did not yet consider. Due to a world-

antiworld conjugation, 2 reduced masses are nevertheless allowed: µ1(+,-) in (4) and µ4(-,+) in (10), 

the latter being neglected by Bohr.  

 

What about the introduction of particle charges? Obviously, these two different external 

signs for reduced masses reflect the signs of a Coulomb power law, confined to one world only. The 

important transition from a reduced mass model without algebraic particle charges to a Coulomb model with 

algebraic particle charges is simple classical physics, if total particle energy is introduced (see Section 3.2). 

Whatever sign we choose for the Coulomb- or charge-based-world (a singlet), the reduced mass for the 2 particle system 

in the mass-based world corresponding with this Coulomb-world will always be a doublet, separated by twice recoil 

2me/Mp. 

 

Although algebraic switches for masses are simply inverted, the quantitative results for reduced 

masses in a zero mass perturbation scheme are indeed different since 

µ4(-,+)/µ1(+,-) = (1+2me/Mp)= (1+me/mH)/(1-me/mH)   

(12) 

as in (7b). Quantitatively, the anomaly of the 2 allowed reduced masses in the matter world is 

µ4(-,+)/µ1(+,-) –1 =2me/Mp =0.0011…   

 

 

(13) 

 

 

These subtle algebraic mass effects are not covered by Bohr’s use of the Coulomb law. Should we 

now refer to bound state QED, where chiral behavior is connected with fermion spin, to solve these new 

simple results or should we proceed as classically as possible with Bohr theory? In fact, it may be 

possible to retrace the effect of algebraic mass asymmetry connected with the world-anti-world 

transition for a bound 2-unit charge Coulomb system directly by considering 2 different reduced masses 

µ1 = -µ3 = me(1-me/mH) = µBohr 

µ4 = -µ2 = me(1+me/mH)

leading to a reduced difference 

(µ4 - µ1)/me= 2me/mH = 0.0011… 

 

 

 

 

(15) 

 

If these derivations are valid, ratio 2me/mH may be a fundamental constant of nature, related finally to the 

matter-antimatter asymmetry in the bound 2-unit charge Coulomb system in H [9]. Using the above metaphor, 

number 2me/mH is related to some internal yet unknown unit for a bound 2-unit charge system, much 

like ±1 are the known units for algebraic numbers. Conventionally, the handedness of algebraic numbers is 

considered as virtual or imaginary. To work with handed numbers, complex numbers must be used [9]. If so, there is 

an analogy between virtual handedness of algebraic numbers, expressible with ±i, and the real handedness for physical 

numbers, expressible with ±me/mH [9b]. Strictly spoken, one only needs one axis with one origin (or 1D) to 

discuss algebraic numbers. If we want to go over to 2 axes and origins (a plane or 2D) or to polar coordinates 

for these same numbers, we introduce an extra (superfluous?), degree of freedom: a (virtual) 

handedness for numbers or, eventually, an imaginary chiral characteristic [9].  

 

If the Bohr electron-proton model were valid, then Bohr unjustly suppressed an algebra 

related to left/right or mirror symmetry, exactly as we proved recently [6,7,9]. Internal algebra is 

suppressed with introducing charge invariance for the attractive Coulomb law. In terms of a lepton-

baryon model in a positive mass world, Bohr overlooked the internal asymmetry connected with the 

constitution (mass) of the baryon, needed to describe the H species by means of a proper unit. In fact, with infinitely 

heavy baryon mass, the 2 reduced masses for H in the +world converge. But in this case, reduced 

mass makes no sense as it goes to zero. A trivial conclusion is that a matter-antimatter asymmetry 

 

 

must be most pronounced for H, where (relative) baryon mass is minimal. 

For a 2-fermion Coulomb system, the mass-conjugation we wanted for the matter-

antimatter (a)symmetry is finally confined to an internal algebra for the classical reduced mass. This 

algebraic recoil theory (ART) is the basis of a chiral field theory, where matter-antimatter asymmetry is 

a left-right or mirror asymmetry. As we will show below, reconsidering the Bohr model for H in 

terms of a Coulomb law reveals the same refinement with respect to charge conjugation.  

The simplicity of the effect of a zero mass perturbation does not prohibit the generation of some interesting 

consequences in the framework of classical physics, without having to recur to bound state QED: only number theory 

is involved. We already remarked that all derivations above remain valid, whether or not we assign a 

charge to particles subject to a zero mass perturbation. In particular, all particles mx, me, Mp and mH 

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 10 

 

 

 

 

 

can -in theory- be considered as electrically neutral particles, without affecting the above results. If true, 

we should rethink, as mentioned above, the Coulomb attraction (see below and [9]). 

We verify that legitimate approximation +1001-1 for +1000, physically forbidden in the 

positive world, becomes legitimate in the positive world to describe number –1000 with –1001+1. 

Only the units, ±1, are the decisive factor. 

The intimate connection of the above approximations for algebraic numbers with number 

π, and especially angle ½π for a mirror plane [6], is now visible. The result of applying a zero mass 

perturbation for a particle having non-zero mass is as generic as obtaining a value for π in the way 

Archimedes did, i.e. by means of inscribing and circumscribing polygons with equivalent sides for a unit circle. 

Inscribed (smaller) polygons lead to π from the lower side (1000-1=999), circumscribed (larger) 

polygons from the upper side (1000+1=1001). This analogy between algebraic number theory and 

approximations for number π is treated further below (Section 3.3), since there is an important 

asymmetry between in- and circumscribed polygons too, connected with a hypotenuse and with axes. 

2.3. Known problems with recoil and errors in QED 

The history of incorporating recoil in bound state QED is a long and delicate one [1,2,8] 

but need not be repeated here. We refer to 2 important remarks since we suspect chiral behavior in 

the electron-proton interaction may be linked with recoil, a classical static effect. 

First, Erickson [8] found odd recoil effects in QED theory for the Lamb shift. Erickson 

wrote: ‘‘This should constitute a strong warning that mass dependences can be rearranged in a number of useful 

forms and the success or utility of one form should not be taken as denying the possibility of another form also being 

successful or useful’ [8]. The matter is discussed in depth below and in [9], since Erickson actually 

meant here that a major uncertainty in bound state QED is how to formulate exactly/analytically the mass 

dependences or, in fine, recoil me/Mp if not modified recoil me/mH. Recoil, i.e. a classical static mass effect, is 

at the roots of our chiral theory above. We will now have to reinterpret Erickson’s QED results for 

atom H [8] in terms of recoil (see Section 4) along the lines set out in previous reports [6,7,9]. 

 

A second remark is more general and points to a large error in bound state QED. Recoil 

enters the Sommerfeld-Dirac H energy expression as [1] 

En,j(H)= µc2/√1+(α/(n-ε))2]-µc2 

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 11 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

wherein ε= j+½ - √[(j+½)2-α2] ≈ α2/(2j+1), in which j is the total angular momentum. Here, 

Cagnac et al. [1] justly remark that the above Sommerfeld-Dirac expression has no exact theoretical 

justification (sic) but it is rather simple. In fact, recoil as used in this famous expression does not make 

sense [1]: there is no valid reason to subtract µc2 instead of mec2, since the unbound free electron 

(mass me) must no longer be connected with proton mass Mp.  

If this were an error indeed, it is an extremely large one since (me-µ)c2=(me/mH)mec2 is 

about 5 times larger than Rydberg ½meα2c2. How to solve this problem is shown elsewhere [20]. 

Moreover, the concept of reduced mass makes no sense either in a relativistic context [1]. 

The conclusion of Section 2 is that we detected a matter-antimatter asymmetry for the 2-unit charge bound 

Coulomb system, the electron-proton system, which is not covered by Bohr theory. 

For the same system H, a unitary world-antiworld-description in terms of particle masses 

leads to an algebraic quadruplet, whereas, in terms of particle charges and Coulomb’s law for the 

same system, it can only be a doublet. This difference provokes, in whatever world we choose, 

always a splitting in terms of the mass description, which is doomed to be invisible in a Bohr 

Coulomb description. 

This reduces to a difference in symmetry for the same system, pending the description, and differences in 

symmetry (presence or absence of a symmetry) are at the hart of differences between achiral and chiral behavior [9].  

We can now proceed analytically with the above asymmetries, absent in Bohr as well as in 

bound state QED theory. We must first find out whether or not these are hidden in Bohr theory, 

without recurring to bound state QED. Since chiral behavior is preponderant in naturally observed 

macrostructures, we must verify how chiral behavior works at the micro-level in nature, an atom. 

3. Consequences: how to get at a chiral field theory? 

Although the presence of charges on all above particles is not critical, it is obvious that for 

a bound 2-unit charge Coulomb system, the combined effect of world and anti-world is generating 

a quadruplet of reduced masses, instead of the single one in Bohr and QED theory. The maximum 

difference possible for a Coulomb 2-unit charge system is 2 (doublet ± or repulsion and attraction). 

The 4 reduced masses for the same 2-particle system in a mass-based world-antiworld description 

are µw (w=1 to 4) and are correlated 2 by 2 in different ways, pending the algebra chosen.

For 2-unit charge systems and in units of conventional reduced mass µBohr, the correlation 

in terms of their in-(I) and external (E) algebra is given in Scheme 1.

A charge-based algebra for a 2-unit charge Coulomb system is a doublet ± like for algebraic numbers 

and their exact external parity. The mass-based algebra for a particle, perturbed with zero mass, is 

generic quadruplet 

µ’=µw/me = ±(1±me/mH) 

 

 

 

 

 

(16a) 

As indicated in [6,9], (16a) shows that in a positive world baryon mass in the reduced mass recipe is 

either mH-me=Mp=1836.1526675 me as in Bohr theory or it is mH+me= 1838.1526675me in a chiral 

field theory. The metaphor here is that the corresponding quadruplet for 2 conjugated complex numbers is ±(1±i), 

where we have left the axis (1D) for a number and replaced the axis with a plane (2D) for describing the same 

number [9]. Representing me/mH by 1/x, the generalized quadruplet is of form ±(1±1/x), exactly of 

the type for the molecular Coulomb quadruplet in 4-fermion systems like molecules [5]. Let us look 

at further consequences of Scheme 1 and, in particular, to the doublet-quadruplet or charge-mass 

descriptions of the very same system H.  

An algebraic recoil theory (ART) leads to the rationale behind mirror or matter-antimatter 

symmetry, which, for H, can be reproduced by means of two physically different structures, the 

physical unit being modified recoil me/mH [9]. 

3.1 Is reduced mass algebraic (ART) and is it a continuous or a discrete variable? 

Having established the measure or unit for discrete mirror or left-right symmetry, the next 

problem is to verify if chiral behavior can vary and how this can be described analytically. The first 

most evident option is to consider p in (2b) as a parameter. 

Even if p in (2b) were variable, the perturbation is still of zero mass type. We get a more 

generalized reduced mass quadruplet 

µ’=µw/me = ±p(1±pme/mH) 

 

 

 

 

 

(16b)

instead of (16a), where only p=1 can produce a non-algebraic Bohr result. Generalized reduced 

mass (16b) in a positive world varies with p and has an extremum for a critical p-value equal to 

a rather strange result, we use elsewhere [20]. Inserting (16c) in (16b) gives extremes µ’crit  

pcrit = ½mH/me=918.57633 

µ’crit = ±½(mH/me)(1±½) 

µw(crit) = ±½mH(1±½) 

 

These correspond with 

µw(crit)+= ±¾mH  

µw(crit)-= ±¼mH   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(16c)  

(16d) 

(16e) 

(16f) 

(16g) 

The ratio of the absolute values in (16f) and (16g) is 3. Instead of classical ±½mH obtained after 

achiral bisection of mH, different reduced masses are obtained, related to mH only, not to me as in Bohr 

theory. We return to this generalization elsewhere [20]. In [9], we said that, in Bohr theory or in QED, it 

is strange that mass mH does not show in the H-energy expressions, except for a small recoil correction. 

In the constraints of the present paper, result (16b) suggests continuously varying reduced 

mass, a consequence of the generalized zero mass perturbation for H and H. 

If true, the possibility that 2-unit charge electron-proton system in a single world may fluctuate 

between an atomic- and an anti-atomic state (and vice versa) cannot be excluded. This is the point we 

made in [6,7,9] in the context of chiral behavior in atom H. The different atomic- and anti-atomic-

states of H can be thought off as back and front of the same neutral species H, which must always 

be differently handed. To make sense, this means that species H must be divided internally to get at a mirror 

effect (inversion in 1D). The only generic characteristic of a mirror (plane) we know with absolute certitude is that, 

in 3D, its plane is confined to an angle of exactly 90° or ½π. But an internal division of species H produces 

a fundamental problem with the Coulomb electron-proton attraction. Indeed, a Coulomb attraction 

-1/r only depends on the length of separation r between 2 charges: it is completely insensitive to the 

internal division of the separation between the charges, its internal (a)symmetry, whereby a mirror plane at 90° may 

be involved [9]. In other words, in 1D, the Coulomb law is insensitive to the position of the origin on 

the axis (the inversion center) or, it depends solely on the total length of a line segment, wherever 

situated on the axis.

3.2 The 2-unit charge separation in the achiral Coulomb field and its chiral behavior 

Confirmation of a continuously varying reduced mass (16b) is easily obtained with Bohr 

theory, without QED. The equivalent of a formulation in terms of reduced masses is given by the 

separation rH for the 2-unit charges. We discuss the positive world solution first and use the Bohr 

reduced mass (4) to illustrate the procedure. We rewrite (4) as 

µ1(+,-) = µBohr = 1/(1/me+1/Mp) 

 

(16h) 

Total energies are mec2=aee2/re and Mp=ape2/rp, ae and ap being scale factors. Using these 

in (16h) and putting a=ae=ap, we get the Bohr equilibrium condition for the 2-particle or pseudo 

one-particle rotator system 

µ1(+,-) = µBohr = (1/a)(e2/c2)/(re+rp) 

 

(16i) 

This describes the classical transition from kinetic energy to Coulomb energy, as in the equilibrium 

condition used in Bohr’s model. This proves how ART leads to an, otherwise seemingly irrelevant, 

internal algebra for the Coulomb field, our basis of a classical chiral field theory. Leaving out scale 

and conversion factors, we have in general discrete relationship: µ(±,±)~(±)1/[re(1±rp/re)].  

Unlike (16b), discreteness disappears with classical physics. The classical positive solution for 

separation rH in the Bohr model is 

rH = re√[1+(rp/re)2-2(rp/re)cosθ]   

(17) 

where re and rp are the respective separations of the charges from the center of mass of the system 

and where θ is the angle between the two vectors re and rp [7,9]. 

To go over to a notation for (17) in terms of particle masses, we use Bohr’s classical 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduced mass recipes 

mere = Mprp 

me/Mp = rp/re 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Introducing (18b) in (17) gives 

rH = re√[1+(me/Mp)2-2(me/Mp)cosθ] 

(18a) 

(18b) 

(19) 

 

The suppression of the internal algebra in (19) by Bohr is easily typified classically: Bohr did 

not allow for variations in θ, which he fixed at θ=π. This is just the anti-parallel configuration of charges or of 

re and rp, which forbids the parallel one with θ=0 (or 2π) along the line between the 2 unit charges 

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 15 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

+e and –e (determining the achiral Coulomb field). With a number metaphor, Bohr only allowed to 

assess number +1000 with number +999+1, not with number +1001-1. 

A variable θ produces different extremes (asymptotes) for linear alignments in positive rH(θ): 

a. θBohr: rH(π)=re +rp =re(1+me/Mp) 

b. θ=0 (2π): rH(0)=re-rp=re(1-me/Mp) 

(20a) 

(20b) 

These values are internally sign-correlated with those for reduced masses in Section 2.  

In contrast with the discrete generic quadruplet of reduced masses (16a), (19) now gives, in 

first approximation, a continuous quadruplet [7,9] 

rH/re ≈ ±[1 - (me/Mp)cosθ] 

 

(21a) 

in function of angle θ. Circular function cosθ in (21a) has taken over the role of the internal algebra 

or the internal ± sign of the generalized reduced mass. Results (16a) and (21a) can be made 

consistent by assuming p in (2b) is not exactly equal to 1 and that it is variable too, see (16b), but 

this would require rescaling by p also (see Section 3.1 and [20]).  

 

Applying (21a) to Bohr theory extends (and refines [6,9]) the Bohr energy formula to 

-EnH ≈ (R∞/n2)[1+(me/Mp)cosθ]  

 

 

 

 

(21b) 

showing classically that the extended or running Rydberg RH(n) in 1/n2 theory may fluctuate 

between two extreme values [6]. With (21b) RH(n)-values are RH(n)≈R∞[1+(me/Mp)cosθ] [7]. 

Further, expansion in the cosine also gives RH(n)≈R∞[1+(me/Mp)(1-½θ2)], quadratic in angle θ [7,9]. 

This angle must be assessed analytically, a difficult but not insoluble problem as shown in [9b]. 

 

Alternative but classical descriptions (19) and (21b) literally show that a transition from one 

state to the other requires crossing a perpendicular configuration with θ=½π or 90°, the characteristic or generic 

angle for a mirror plane. Conceptually, there is nothing wrong with an extended but still classical Bohr 

theory, i.e. letting angle θ vary, to understand running Rydbergs, as found recently [6,7,9]. These 

unambiguously led to the concept of mirror symmetry for atoms or to a CSB theory for atom H [6]. Intra-

atomic symmetry is now naively understandable even with classical Bohr theory (21b) [6,7,9], 

without having to refer to bound state QED and its underlying Dirac and Einstein theories [9], 

where there are problems with recoil (see Section 2.3). A naïve classical interpretation of varying 

Rydbergs RH(n) [6], based upon (19) or (21) [7], does not require new physics [9]. 

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 16 

 

The natural naïve explanation is indeed that rH (19), and hence cosθ, would vary with n also 

[7,9]. And if these fluctuations could be understood with classical physics [9b], the role or meaning 

of QED (and of STR) may even be questioned [6,7,9]. We notice explicitly that original Bohr theory 

contains all ingredients to arrive at a chiral theory. Only, these possible (hidden) extensions were suppressed 

unjustly although they are easily exposed [6,7,9]. Obviously, there are obstacles to refine original Bohr theory 

in this naïve way otherwise results [6,7] would have been obtained earlier. What are the difficulties with this 

extension of Bohr theory [9]? 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.3 Difficulties with extended Bohr model (21b) for the 2-unit charge separation and chiral behavior 

(a) The correlation between internal algebraic recoil theory for µ and variable charge 

separations rH is not one by one, since (20b) suggests a composite particle (baryon) with mass Mp-

me. Mass-conjugation in the context of chiral behavior must be interpreted with mH±me (16a) 

rather than with Mp±me [9]. 

(b) With 2 reduced masses allowed in the same world, 2 Rydbergs are created for the same 

system H. This important difficulty is treated separately in Section 3.4. 

(c) For an electron-proton attraction, an internal division of rH in re and rp does not affect the 

magnitude of the Coulomb force, which is achiral or, at least too symmetrical [9] (see also below).  

(d) This division generates two monopoles instead of a dipole for the bound 2-unit charge 

Coulomb system, which must be avoided. How to do this using a 4-fermion model for perturbed H, is 

explained in [9]. 

(e) An important difficulty is the direction of the Coulomb field in the hypothesis that angle θ is 

not a constant. With varying θ, the direction of the field between 2-unit charges will show small 

fluctuations in the absolute reference frame, which are difficult to understand. For a pair of 

conjugated charges, the direction of the field is from one particle (+) directly to the other (-) in a 

straight line (a dipole). Therefore, fluctuations in θ as in (19) mean that both strength and direction of the 

2-unit charge Coulomb attraction fluctuate, which does not make sense in classical physics. In a unitary 

rectangular triangle ABC, with A charge +e, B origin O and C charge -e, hypotenuse AC (rH) gives a 

maximum deviation of the field’s direction from the axis. The strength of the perpendicular 

configuration depends on 1/√[1+(me/Mp)2] since cos90°= 0. The (minor) difficulty with the extension of 

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 17 

Bohr theory generates a (major) conflict with the framework of STR, the Special Theory of Relativity [9b]. 

Although in the linear classical alignment as in Bohr theory there is no direct connection between 

relativity and recoil [1], the possibility that field directions are no longer on an axis generates extra 

problems. 

 

(f) In fact, if the direction of the field in the perpendicular state were decisive to describe the energy 

of the electron-proton system, we get, using u=me/Mp, higher order terms of type  

1/√(1+u2)=1- ½u2 + ⅜u4 -…  

not only (see Section 4.3) of the same form as those in a Dirac-Einstein relativistic expansion in α2 

[9]. With classical physics, the use of a perpendicular model for scaling a uni-axial Coulomb field effect, a common 

practice in STR, cannot be understood [9]. In addition, the symmetrical counterpart energies of type  

1/√(1-u2) =1+ ½u2 + ⅜u4 +… 

can never be obtained and even cannot make sense, since, with reference to STR equations, they 

are virtual or imaginary: only squared product iu can give –u2. However, exactly this latter type of energy 

would confine the inter-particle separation to an axis, as it should, and not to the hypotenuse [9]. We can now 

return to the analogy (Section 2) between the determination of π and the zero mass perturbation for 

H. A circumscribed polygon gives larger rectangular triangles (formed by a bisected side and the 

center of the unit circle) than the inscribed polygon. For a circumscribed polygon of n equal sides with 

length 2Lc, all 2n rectangular left and right handed triangles depend on hypotenuse h=√(1+Lc

2). For 

an inscribed polygon with sides of length 2Li, triangles have a hypotenuse equal to 1. This means that 

one of their sides s (an axis) has length s=√(1-Li

2). There is no reason to suppose that using a circumscribed 

polygon based upon √(1+Lc

2) is the only real or allowed method to determine π and that using an inscribed polygon 

based upon √(1-Li2) is a virtual or forbidden method. The only difference between the 2 Archimedean π-

approximations is that one is bound to the circle from the inside (in 1D: N-1, the inner world), the 

other from the outside (in 1D: N+1, the outer world). With this model, the STR framework is related 

only to circumscribed polygons to determine π and refutes the other procedure. 

 

This seemingly trivial matter is of fundamental interest since it would reduce the variations 

in θ and the corresponding variations in strength and direction above to a variation in strength 

alone, leaving the direction of the internal field unchanged and confined to an axis. The full discussion is given 

in [9] but in the context of this work it is useful to state that the alternative to separation (19) 

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 18 

derives from what we called an engine model [9]. This uses the 2 other angles η and χ in the same 

triangle ABC with θ=π-(η+χ) [9]. We obtain for an axis (a field) 

rH = rpcosη+recosχ 

instead of (19) [9]. Since2 rpsinη=resinχ, we get 

rH = rpcosη+re√[1-(me/Mp)2(1-cos2η)] 

 

 

 

 

which leads to 1/√(1-u2) for the perpendicular case where η=½π or 90°. An engine model based formula 

for particle separation rH is different from Bohr’s (19) [9b]. It secures that 1/√(1-u2)-type energies 

for perpendicular configurations are perfectly allowed, whereas, in the framework of STR, these can 

only be imaginary. A conceptual advantage of an engine model is that a real perturbation can be 

understood in terms of starting an (hydrogen) engine or of fluctuations of an origin. 

Alternative engine formulae correspond with a fluctuating separation for the 2-unit charges 

too but its direction remains confined to a single axis, as it should in a field theory. Here, we see why and how 

the framework of Special Theory of Relativity is not an absolute one: perhaps, it is only of relative 

importance [9b]. With standard engineering mechanics interesting results are obtained for an engine 

in perturbed H, among which an alternative for cosθ above [9b]. 

A consistent generalization of Bohr H theory is important for understanding the laws of 

nature (see Introduction). In Section 3.3, we have shown that these theoretical consequences are of 

general interest for the 2-unit charge interaction and that their analytical formulation is 

unambiguous. The conflict with STR is easily solved classically. Now, we must test the above refinement 

of Bohr theory, possible with (19) and (21b) and with an engine model [9]. 

3.4 Two different Rydbergs for atom H? 

Before doing so, we return to problem (b) in Section 3.3. Allowing for parallel and anti-parallel 

structures for 2 charges in H is a substitute for matter-antimatter asymmetry. With Bohr theory and p=1 in 

(2b), the problem is that 2 different discrete Rydbergs are generated for H, given by 

RH(+,-) = R∞ (1-me/mH) = R∞ /(1+me/Mp) = RH(Bohr)   

RH(-,+) = R∞ (1+me/mH)

2 Stevin, born in Bruges (Flanders) in 1548, used this formula to refute a perpetuum mobile in a way much 
admired by Feynman. Stevin concluded Wonder en is gheen wonder, which means: A miracle is not a miracle, Magic 
without magic (the title of Wheeler’s album) or Anomalous is not anomalous, a QED-inspired translation [9].

corresponding with a large difference, not less than (2.59=) 118 cm-1, if R∞≈109,737.3 cm-1. There is 

no experimental evidence for such large gap. At first sight, a matter-antimatter asymmetry and 2 largely 

different Rydbergs (22) seem to be falsified by the H line spectrum, as remarked previously [9]. 

Despite this, quadruplet (21) suggests that, in a given world, there may nevertheless be a 

continuous transition between 2 Rydbergs, or 2 different reduced masses for neutral H. If, at first sight, 

the existence of 2 largely different Rydbergs (22) contradicts observation, the challenge is to find out whether or not the 

line spectrum of atom H is consistent with a continuous transition between any 2 Rydbergs.  

We must decide on the more important aspect of CSB theory or ART for atom H: is it 

(i) the existence of 2 different Rydbergs with a gap of 118 cm-1 using the Bohr H model and R∞, an 

external criterion, or 

(ii) the existence of continuously varying Rydbergs with an extremum at exactly ½π or 90° [6], an internal 

criterion, without fixing the difference between Rydbergs at 118 cm-1 ?  

This situation is comparable with asymptotes for circular functions pending the value of 

the angle. To go from asymptote +1 at angle 0° to asymptote –1 at 180° or π for a cosine, the zero 

asymptote at 90° or ½π must be crossed. For H, there may be something wrong with scaling 

asymptotes [9]. In fact, the 2 Rydbergs for H are conceptually related to asymptotes +1 and –1 for a 

cosine. The internal mechanism, governed by a critical angle of 90° or ½π, can never be avoided, whatever the values 

assigned to external asymptotes. Internal constraint (ii) is more restrictive than external constraint (i). The 

difference between the asymptotes (Rydbergs) is mainly a question of scaling [9]. Of course, there 

must be a relation between chiral and external asymptotes or Rydbergs, as we will show in [20]. 

3.5 The detection of different Rydbergs and a CSB theory for atom H [6,7,9] 

Given their importance in the context of matter-antimatter (a)symmetry and constraint (ii) 

in Section 3.4, variations in RH in function of quantum number n can indeed be detected with 

running Rydbergs, defined as [6,7,9]  

RH(n) = -EnH.n2   

 

 

 

 

 

 

(23) 

Running Rydbergs (23) cannot but describe the extra symmetry, if any, contained in a landscape for 

H beyond Bohr 1/n2 theory, giving –EnH=RH/n2. RH(n) illustrates quantitatively the algebra (ART) 

overlooked in Bohr theory. 

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 20 

 

RH(n) (23) in [6], as well as a Mexican hat or double well curve for H in [7], show that a 

continuous transition between Rydbergs is very consistent indeed with the H line spectrum for ns½ 

singlet states. This proves indirectly that 2 different H Rydbergs exist (constraint (i) in Section 3.4): 

only their difference is not equal to 118 cm-1 but it is much smaller [6,9]. The problem can be solved with 

rescaling the Rydberg [9,20]. Errors in Bohr theory are of order 10-7-10-8, but varying Rydbergs give 

errors of only 10-11, a factor 1000 better (see below and [9]). 

 

In addition, we showed that in H there is an internal mirror plane exactly at its generic 

angle n0=½π [6], where the maximum Rydberg is 109,679.352282 cm-1 [6]. This is different from 

RH and from the NIST-value [6]. Only a harmonic Rydberg separates hydrogen- and antihydrogen-

states exactly at n0=π in the Mexican hat curve [7]. The Bohr Rydberg –E1H is 109,678.773704 cm-1 

[6,8], the NIST value of 109,677.58553 cm-1 applies to -E∞H[6]. Maximum and minimum Rydbergs 

are separated by 1.7667 not 118 cm-1 (see also [20]). 

 

Earlier [6,7], we interpreted these results as a chiral symmetry breaking effect (mirror 

symmetry) without offering an explanation. Here, we see that it refers exactly to the symmetry we 

introduced above as a working hypothesis to discuss a zero mass perturbation for atom H. By 

extension, the matter-antimatter (a)symmetry is now identified quantitatively, although not yet completely 

understood. However, we see how useful simple and classical approaches can be for a fundamental 

problem: (a)symmetry of matter and antimatter and an inherent internal mass-conjugation in a 

single world. We must now find out quantitatively if recoil or better the ratio me/mH is really at the hart of a chiral 

symmetry breaking process in species H [9], since this problem was not discussed in [6,7]. 

 

 

3.6 Putting the matter-antimatter asymmetry of CSB theory or ART quantitatively to the test 

Despite its shortcomings at this level, our analysis provides 3 quantitative criteria to put our 

mirror or matter-antimatter asymmetry hypothesis, based upon recoil, to the test.  

(i) The only generic characteristic of a mirror plane is its angle: 90° or ½π. 

(ii) Using (19), a separation of contributions from world and antiworld to a scaled H line spectrum 

is governed by 2 different coefficients  

±me/mH = ±0.000544… 

 

 

 

 

 

(24)

with me/mH=1/1837.1526675=0.0005443206. The difference between 2 coefficients +me/mH and 

–me/mH is 2me/mH, discussed around (15), see also (21a). 

(iii) As a consequence of the Mexican hat curve [7], symmetry in the complete n-set (n=1 to 20) for 

Lyman ns½ singlets [8] is broken exactly at n0=π. This gives set A with 3 data points (n=1 to n=3) 

and set B with 17 (3<n≤20). Then, we must find out which set, A or B, belongs to the anti-atom 

domain in the positive world. The guiding line is negative coefficient -me/mH in (24), which is 

related to the conventional Bohr atom world, since, with mH=Mp+me, we have 1- me/mH = 

Mp/(Mp+me)= 1/(1+me/Mp) at the roots of the standard H Bohr model. 

A practical constraint for A with 3 data points is that fitting is limited to order 2 (quadratic 

fit). This is the phenomenological procedure we adopt now but we must arrive at the analytical 

form of a suited linear 1D representation for H, a topic discussed in full in [9,20].  

3.7 CSB theory or ART: scaling the primary 1D field axis for matter- and antimatter-worlds 

With 19th century chiral behavior, 3D structures are stable, which implies a minimum of 4 

particles [9]3. To generalize left-right (a)symmetry, the 3D structure must be folded [9,21-23] to 

arrive, over an intermediary 2D-structure, to a linear 1D equivalent to quantify the uni-axial (static) 

field-effect, responsible for a left-right difference on a single axis (the uni-axial representation of a 

field) [9]. The equivalent is unfolding an origin on an axis and gradually unfold further to reach 3D [9]. 

The consequence for the inverse unfolding procedure is trivial: to arrive from a 1D to 3D structure, 

we must gradually go from 2 (1D), over 3 (2D), to at least 4 point-like particles (3D). Therefore, if 

natural perturbed atom H shows left-right asymmetry, at least 4 fermions are required, which makes Bohr’s model 2 

fermions or 1 boson short. We can solve this problem and avoid monopoles, see [9].  

 

The intermediate planar 2D complex for which 3 particles are sufficient can be visualized 

by a bisected equilateral triangle, where one half is left-, the other right-handed. Without leaving the 

plane, the two halves can never be made to coincide, even when their surfaces are equal (Lord 

Kelvin’s definition of chiral behavior). Alternatively, back and front of a triangle are always differently 

handed too: if a 4th particle is involved, the handedness of the 4-particle structure depends on the 

position of the 4th particle: in front or at the back of a triangle [9]. In any case, the triangle (3-

particle system or N=3) is critical to distinguish between symmetry and energy based models to 

describe the final 4-particle structure (see below and [9]). 

 

In principle, a 2-unit (point-like) charge system is uni-dimensional or 1D and we suspect 

that, if we want to quantify all of the above, especially the coefficients (24), we are confined to use a 

linear 1D model based upon line segment rH, best suited for this purpose. In fact, we need the best 

description for 2 point-like particles situated on a single axis and an achiral or chiral division of the line segment 

between the two [9]. The problem was discussed in Section 3.3, point (e), with reference to the engine 

model, STR and Archimedean π approximations [9]. The important difference between uniaxial and 

biaxial models for field effects, thought to be uniaxial, is discussed more fully elsewhere, also in 

connection with STR, the Special Theory of Relativity [9] (see also Section 3.3). 

 

 

 

3.8 Difference between symmetry- and energy-models. Continuous chirality measures (CCMs) [9,21-23]. 

There is a difference between a description of N-particle (-fermion) systems using a 

symmetry- and an energy-based model with Coulomb’s power law [9]. For symmetry-based models, the 

positions of the N vertices of a structure with respect to the center of the structure are required. For 

energy-based models with Coulomb’s 1/r law, all separations r between N particles are required. It is 

easily shown that the 2 models converge if and only if N=3 [9]. 

One consequence is that Coulomb’s law for a bound 2-unit charge attraction (N=2) is 

always achiral4 or (too) symmetrical [9]. If the line segment between 2-unit charges as in H is rH, 

bisection using 2 equal charges for scaling gives two sign-conjugated line segments +½rH and -½rH 

of equal length (monopoles), meeting at the origin. Inversely, the origin is unfolded in an achiral way if 

2conjugated unit charges attract: there is left-right symmetry, determined by external algebra ± 1only (or ±½, if a 

different scale factor is used) [9]. This external algebra secures the 2 halves of line segment rH can never 

be made to coincide without leaving the axis (Lord Kelvin’s definition of chiral behavior in 1D). We 

said that for a bound 2-unit charge Coulomb system, the description is always too achiral [9]. In fact, for 

a result based upon the Coulomb law or –e2/rH, the internal symmetry of line segment rH does not 

matter: it is overlooked/disregarded, as remarked above. Up to this level, the analogy with fermion spin is 

                                                 
4 Chirality means an absence of a symmetry. The closest achiral (more symmetrical) structure contains this 
symmetry element [9], an important aspect of chiral behavior [23].  

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 23 

obvious, especially since spin is defined with units (numbers) ±½. The above model with ±½rH is 

conceptually classical and more illustrative. 

 

 

 

 

In fact, when this very same line segment rH is divided asymmetrically or less symmetrically 

(proportionally), as it is in (19) for H due to classical static mass-bound field effects (18), less achiral, 

which literally means chiral, behavior sets in [9]. Now, there is left-right asymmetry, the asymmetric part of 

the left-right symmetry being determined by internal algebra (16a), as explained above (Scheme 1). Generically, we 

say simply that the charge symmetry in the electron-proton system in H is broken by (a large) mass (difference). 

A full account is elsewhere [9] but the analysis here suffices to understand the procedure 

adopted in a CSB H theory. Avnir’s group [21-23] showed that the chiral behavior of observed stable chiral 

3D structures can vary in a continuous way. For chiral behavior, they use CCMs, continuous chirality measures 

[23], which allow dealing quantitatively with observed left-right transitions. So, we already classified 

continuous quadruplet (21) as a quantitative CCM for atom H [9b]. The prototype is a classical 19th century 

Walden inversion: a transition from a left- to a right-handed stable 3D structure, consisting of at least 4 particles 

[9b]. The reaction describing the Walden left-right inversion needs a quadratic description for 

reactivity parameters with an extremum at 90° (½π) for the mirror plane [21-23], which is exactly the 

extremum point for running Rydbergs (23) for atom H [6]. This similarity between experiments on classical 

(variable) chiral behavior of stable structures, known from the 19th century, and the running 

Rydbergs for H [6,7], led us to conclude that, eventually also in atom H, (variable) chiral behavior is 

detected [6,7,9]. We said [6] that the theoretical framework of bound state QED can not cope with 

classical 19th century chiral behavior: our formula above, are absent in bound state QED. 

To quantify (21), we expect that only data corresponding with a linear 1D structure (on a 

single axis) will be able to confirm the predicted value of left-right coefficients ±me/mH (24) for H 

in the matter-antimatter (a)symmetry model introduced here. Finding the best 1D model is a 

problem. Taking the square root of Bohr’s result or √(RH/n2) gives linearity in function of 1/n but 

makes no reference to the mirror symmetry we detected [6,7]. 

We now proceed with Section 3.6, where the 20 data of the Lyman ns-singlet series [8] 

were divided in subsets A and B due to the critical n-value π in the Mexican hat curve [7]. We 

remark that, using running Rydbergs [6] with critical n-value ½π=1.57…, only Bohr’s ground state

for H (n=1) separates from all other states with n>1 due to an asymmetry, a separation invisible in 

Bohr theory and in bound state QED as well.  

To solve the recoil related difficulties, exposed by Erickson [8] (see Section 2.3), we must 

make advantage of the only internal anchor available (½π) to rewrite one-electron energies for atom 

H in a linear form: the mirror symmetry we detected [6,7,9] must be the basis of a linear H model. 

3.9 Proving the matter-antimatter (a)symmetry: a phenomenological linear 1D approach for atom H 

To settle these problems with recoil [8], we anchor the H-data by means of variable π, the 

crucial issue in chiral field theory. For a linear representation of H symmetry breaking details, we 

restart the procedure with running Rydbergs RH(n) [6], governed by generic mirror plane parameter 

½π [6]. A quadratic fit for each set A and B gives slightly different critical n0A and n0B values and 

harmonic Rydbergs Rharm(A) and Rharm(B). 

Chiral contributions CCnH are positive [6,7] 

CCnH = Rharm –RH(n) = as(1-n0/n)2 

where n0 is very close to ½π [6] and as is an internal chiral asymptote [6,9]. For A and B, a linear 1D 

representation, anchored by mirror plane reference value ½π [6], is now easily obtained with the square

root of (25) or 

√CCnH = (1-n0/n)√as 

n0 =½(n0A+n0B)  

n0/n-1    

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and use this to plot √CCnH from (26) versus  

To get a measure as close as possible to the real situation, we compute an average n0 with  

Next, we fit experimental √CCnH (26) versus (28) for A and B. This gives 2 data sets in the whole n-

range (1 to 20) and will show how these depend on mean value variable (28). In this way, the linear 

1D model (26) for H is anchored with ½π as we attempted. Then, we can determine the linear 

characteristics of the H Lyman ns-singlets for hydrogen- and antihydrogen-states and compare field 

properties of matter- with those of antimatter-states, expected to obey different recoil coefficients 

(24). Differences ∆nH between data sets √CCnH(Atheo) and √CCnH (Btheo), plotted versus (28), lead to 

linear 1D coefficients, also anchored with mirror angle ½π. Results are in Section 4.

3.10 The natural extension: a real non-zero or asymmetrical mass perturbation 

Using a zero-mass (mass-symmetrical) perturbation it is not difficult to consider the effects 

of a non-zero-mass or asymmetrical mass perturbation for H. In terms of H energy, the 

symmetrical perturbation (1) gives energy  

EH = +mHc2 ±0  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(29) 

A real perturbation (an asymmetrical mass perturbation) corresponds with different p-

values for world and antiworld in the perturbing pair. The symmetrical case with the same p-value 

in either world or ±p(me-me) was discussed above. A variable p (Section 3.2) does not affect the 

internal symmetry of a zero mass perturbation.  

Asymmetrical or non-zero mass perturbations (perturbations by kT, hν, atom…) imply 

different pmxn-values for world and antiworld or at least p1mx1 – p2mx2 ≠ 0. If p2=1, as in Bohr 

theory, and p1>1, the effect of a real perturbation in the real world is a rescaling (lowering by 1/p1) 

of the energy of the system to a less stable form. Rescaling for H in general is discussed in [20]. 

4. Results and discussion 

4.1 The appearance of world and antiworld chiral field coefficients ±me/mH (24) in the H line spectrum 

As accurate data for a complete set from n 1 to 20 are not available (see Section 5), data are 

calculated as in [6,7] using Erickson’s QED results [8]. Data are collected in Table 1.  

For RH(n), the quadratic fit for the complete set of 20 data points was given in [6]. We 

repeat the result: RH(n)= -4.3674718717/n2 + 5.5556169344/n + 109677.585534798 cm-1, giving 

n0= 1.5722725 and Rharm =109,679.352282 cm-1[6]. 

For sets A and B we obtain slightly different values instead or: 

(A) 

RH(n)(A)= -4.3657644130/n2 + 5.5533730093/n + 109677.5860953890 cm-1, giving 

Rharm(A)= 109,679.352106 cm-1 and n0A =1.5722929 and 

(B) 

RH(n)(B)= -4.3726920038/n2 + 5.5576673139/n + 109677.5854005220 cm-1, leading to 

Rharm(B)= 109,679.3513416 cm-1 and n0B=1.5735710. 

Average n0, defined by (27), is n0=1.5729319. Fits suffice to construct a ½π-related 1D presentation 

for atom H, conform our requirements above (see Section 3.9).

√CCnH(A)= -1.3283735313(n0/n-1) + 0.0005399081  

√CCnH(B)= -1.3294271704(n0/n-1) - 0.0005399910  

 

 

 

 

(30a) 

(30b) 

Result (30) shows that the sets separate clearly as expected theoretically with (24). With NIST, we have 

±me/mH=±0.0005443206. For A, n=n0 in (30a) gives +0.0005399081, within 1.02 % of the NIST-

value. For B n=n0 in (30b) gives 0.80 % deviation for –0.000539991. 

The average error (not shown here, but see [9]) for the 20 data with fits (30) is 0.77 kHz [9b], 

corresponding with only 2.7 10-13 for 19 terms, seemingly sufficient to compete eventually with the accuracy, claimed 

by QED [9].We verify that a phenomenological CSB theory for atom H reproduces QED-results 

without loss of accuracy but without needing the QED hocus-pocus [9]. 

To get finally at the matter-antimatter world anomaly, invisible in QED, we simply subtract (30b) 

from (30a) to yield the differences ∆nH. The fit is 

∆nH =√CCnH(A)-√CCnH(B)= 0.0010536390(n0/n-1)+0.0010798991 

(31a) 

≈0.001063n0/n ≈ 2(me/mH)n0/n  

 

 

 

(31b) 

Fig. 1 includes the plot of ∆nH versus variable (28). It is easily verified from results (30)-(31) 

that, differentiating between matter-world and antimatter-world using the H line spectrum 

reasonably reproduces theoretical coefficients +me/mH and –me/mH for each world, see (24), since 

+me/mH –(–me/mH)= 2me/mH. We conclude that the theoretical world-antiworld asymmetry we 

anticipated is reasonably obeyed experimentally. Analytical result (31) is not covered theoretically by 

highly complex bound state QED [2] at all, where there are still difficulties with the role of mass or 

recoil, as remarked by Erickson [8] (see also Section 2.3). 

 

Furthermore, the coefficient for set A is +me/mH and for set B it is –me/mH. This proves that 

set A with n<π belongs to the antihydrogen or antimatter-world where baryon mass is mH+me; B, with n>π, belongs 

to the conventional Bohr matter-world, where baryon mass is mH-me= Mp. Although this conclusive and 

detailed evidence could not be reached with the Mexican hat curve, detected earlier [7], this result is 

completely out of reach with present day QED. If all this were true, the important term 1S-2S for 

natural perturbed H (critical for CPT and for the artificial antihydrogen projects at CERN /Fermilab) 

belongs to the antihydrogen-, not to the hydrogen-, domain [7,9]. 

 

Reminding that n0 in (27) and (31b) is close to ½π [6,7], we can rewrite (31b) as

pag. 27 

∆nH ≈0.001063n0/n ≈ (me/mH)π/n 

 

 

 

 

(31c) 

a strange analytical result, wherein the fine structure constant is absent. In view of Erickson’s remark on 

mass dependences in bound state QED [8], especially those related to the Lamb shift [6] (see 

Section 2.3), result (31c) is remarkable. Pending the correct value for the external asymptote, n-

independent matter-antimatter asymmetry n∆nH seems to be solely a matter of recoil (or better 

me/mH) and of number π. In an anti-matter world it is +½πme/mH, it is -½πme/mH in a matter 

world. Matter and antimatter worlds are differently scaled, the ultimate basis of left-right asymmetry 

and of H chiral behavior in the real world [9]. All these pertinent consequences of the matter-

antimatter asymmetry we introduced are invisible in the standard framework of QED. Moreover, 

the inconsistency with the use of reduced mass in QED (see Section 2.3) can be removed. We must 

conclude that QED cannot yet be validated as it stands, since, not only with its ambiguous use of 

recoil, it is unclear whereto QED is heading in the end. 

Unprecedented results (30)-(31) are important too for electron mass me. With me based 

upon Bohr’s electron-proton model, NIST ratio Mp/me=1,836.1526675 applies. An anomaly may, 

however, occur on account of different scaling in world and anti-world. And, as soon as it occurs, it 

must have a value of (mH+me)/(mH-me)–1=1,838.1526675 /1,836.1526675-1≈2me/mH≈0.0010892 

[9]. This result is discussed in Section 4.3. 

4.2 Energy differences between 2-unit Coulomb systems in world and antiworld 

With (31), we now estimate the energy differences between a 2-unit charge system in a world 

and in an antiworld to get an idea about the asymmetry. We use the running Rydbergs RH(n)A in the 

anti-matter-world and those in the matter-world RH(n)B. Differences δEnH, reflecting the matter-

antimatter asymmetry in terms of energy, are given by 

δEnH = [RH(n)A-RH(n)B]/n2  

 

 

 

 

 

(32) 

These tentative data are in the last column of Table 1. Fig. 2 shows the results in MHz.  

 

This approximation is only tentative, as it is constrained by a 2nd order fit, by the small 

number of data in set A and by our limited knowledge of the subject at large. In fact, it may well be 

that our results are in part accidental due to the rather arbitrary definition of n0 in (27). How to 

circumvent these limitations and uncertainties is shown elsewhere [20]. Nevertheless, and within the 

 

 

 

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 28 

constraints of our present approach, world-antiworld asymmetry in H seems large for n=1 and decreases 

with increasing n. The meaning of the 4th order fit for (32) in Fig. 2 is not clear for the reasons 

mentioned above. The same applies for the values of coefficients in 1/n2, 1/n3 and 1/n4. Further 

work is needed [20] but we have a view on matter-antimatter (a)symmetry from Erickson’s data [8]. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4.3 Unexpected external confirmation from the observed free electron mass 

An anomaly between matter- and antimatter worlds (see Section 4.1) must, if it occurred, be of 

order 0.0011, conform to (13) and (15) and their analytical equivalents 2me/Mp and 2me/mH. 

Free electron mass me can be assessed from its magnetic moment, which depends directly 

on me, the only variable in the expression for this moment. A long time ago, Dehmelt succeeded in 

measuring this moment, see [24], and found an anomaly of 0.0011592 (NIST). Schwinger [25] 

explained this anomaly with a first order correction term ½α/π=α/2π = 0.00116…. Surprisingly, 

these 2 values are, in turn, close to the mass anomaly 2me/Mp (13). Inverse values 2π/α and 

½Mp/me are 861 and 918 respectively, a small difference of 57 (6 %), which is too large in present 

day precision physics [9]. We already said that number 2me/mH, if really of basic importance for 

matter-antimatter asymmetries in nature, must be a fundamental constant of nature. Whether or not 

it is competitive with concurrent α/2π, the most important ingredient of bound state QED [2,9], 

remains to be determined.  

The intimate affinity of ½α/π and 2me/mH weighs heavily on our discussion of expansions 

in (me/mH)2 and STR expansions in α2, discussed in Section 3.3 (f). We now see that not only the 

type of the expansions is similar but also the physics behind the expansions is very similar.  

Conversely, the ratio of recoil and fine structure constant (½mH/me)/(1/α)=αmH/(2me) 

≈2π may be looked at as a physical determination of π [9], an issue we will raise again [20]. In this form, 

the analogy with an Archimedean or mathematical determination of π (see Sections 2 and 3) becomes 

apparent. If our analysis were valid, the observed free electron mass complies with an antimatter-state 

configuration for a bound 2-unit Coulomb system in the matter world.  

Finally, the reference mass for a free electron is not a proton with mass mH-me=Mp but a 

baryon5 with mass mH+me [9b]. Today, only Mp is the basis of modern metrology [1]. In the present 

                                                 
5 We will not speculate here on its relation with the neutron, which has mass very close to mH+me.

theory, exactly this same anomaly determines the world-antiworld difference for the so-called simple 

electron-proton system in atom H. QED uses corrections for this anomaly [1,2,8]: in CSB, the 

anomaly is not a correction as it is at the hart of chiral behavior in atom H. 

4.4 External confirmation from chemical bonds: atom-antiatom chemistry 

At the intra-atomic level, it is difficult to expose the left-right difference between the atom- 

and the antiatom-states since it is small (charge invariance of the 2-unit charge or electron-proton 

Coulomb attraction). At the inter-atomic level, its effect must be more pronounced. In fact, atom-

atom or antiatom-antiatom Hamiltonians differ from the atom-antiatom Hamiltonian, since a parity 

operator (a switch) is needed to account for a charge inversion in the antiatom [5]. A charge-related 

parity operator within a molecular Hamiltonian is absent in Heitler-London theory [3] (see [5]). As stated in the 

Introduction, the stability of an atom-antiatom complex remains ambiguous despite many attempts 

to assess it [10-16]. We remind that 4-particle systems are insoluble anyway [5,9]. As shown before 

[5], the main characteristic of atom-antiatom Hamiltonians is that nucleon-nucleon interaction is attractive instead of 

being repulsive (as it is in Heitler-London theory [3]). This picture is not only very consistent with 

observed molecular PECs (potential energy curves) [5] but also with the general and intuitive idea, 

persisting since many a decade, that a molecular function should vary as –1/R, where R is the inter-

nuclear separation, the bond length [5,9]. This shows that our results above, extracted from atomic 

line spectra, are confirmed by molecular band spectra [5,9]. 

It is remarkable that the chemical bond theory, closest to the concept of chemical atom-

antiatom bonding, is old-fashioned naive ionic bonding of type –1/R too [5,9]: a nucleon-nucleon 

attraction introduced in the 18th century (Davy, Berzelius...). This concept was abolished almost immediately, 

but unjustly [5,9], after Heitler-London theory [3] was available. 

4.5 Chiral field theory and metrology. 

An important consequence of ART or CSB theory for atom H is that the relation between 

the Rydberg for atom H, RH, and its counterpart R∞= RH(1+me/Mp) has lost its uniqueness and so, 

its reliability for metrology [1]. This problem is so important for metrology (and the whole of 

physics) that it is far beyond the scope of the present report. We only want to point out that a 

 

 

 

 

 

G. Van Hooydonk, Matter antimatter asymmetry 21/06/02 

pag. 30 

metrology, even when based upon the anomalous mass of the free electron (see Section 4.3), is still 

susceptible of a relatively simple metrological treatment.  

5. Conclusion 

Classical physics allows understanding an internal mass-conjugation and its implicit matter-

antimatter asymmetry in a single world, where only one kind of mass (+ or -) is allowed. A mass-

based physical description for a 2-particle system provides with more algebra (symmetry) than a 2-

particle Coulomb law, if the internal symmetry of the separation between the 2 charges is overlooked. To arrive at 

additional symmetry, a Coulomb field must be assigned a gauge or the (field) axis must have an origin. This result 

must lead to a more general approach [20]. 

Validating bound state QED today is indeed premature as argued in [6,7,9]. If level 

energies are anchored with mirror characteristic ½π, we get a quantitative exposure of the role of 

recoil for 2-unit charge systems, impossible or at least uncertain in bound state QED [8]. The 

picture for atom H arrived at with CSB is completely different from that given by QED. 

To go further with this work the complete Lyman ns½ singlet series from n=1 to about 20 must be 

measured as precisely and as soon as possible. The precision for term H1S-2S [26] is a guideline for this 

urgently needed fieldwork. The experimental set of 20 H terms available [27] has uncertainties of 3 

MHz (or 0.0001 cm-1), too large for matter-antimatter asymmetries detected now.  

A major goal of CERN/Fermilab H experiments is measuring the H 1S-2S-transition as a 

test for CPT and QED. We repeat [6,7] that this term was already measured accurately [26]. Seeing 

the present results and [6,7], this measured term H1S-2S [26] belongs to the H-domain in the real world. 

When looked at in this perspective, the mass of the free electron is not that anomalous. With Stevin, 

we argue that, in this case, anomalous is not anomalous, which typifies the general theme of our reports on 

the H line spectrum and on QED in particular [9,20]. 

Finally, the historical Lamb and Retherford 1950 remark that the Coulomb attraction between 

electron and proton is not well understood [28] was visionary. The 2-unit charge Coulomb attraction was 

considered as too achiral, as 2 equal charges reside on particles with different mass. Static mass effects like in a 

balance [9] secure the H electron-proton attraction is chiral rather than achiral.

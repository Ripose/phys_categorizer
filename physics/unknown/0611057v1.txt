ABSTRACT 

 
This paper presents the principles and experimental results of an optical fiber QKD system operating at 1550 nm, and 
using  the  BB84  protocol  with  QPSK  signals.  Our  experimental  setup  consists  of  a  time-multiplexed  super-homodyne 
configuration using P.I.N detectors in a differential scheme as an alternative to avalanche photon counting. Transmission 
over 11km of optical fiber has been done using this detection scheme and major relevant characteristics such as noise, 
quantum efficiency and bit error rate (BER) are reported. 
 
Keywords:  Quantum  Key  Distribution,  quantum  cryptography,  coherent  detection,  homodyne  detection,  QPSK

1.  INTRODUCTION 

 
The first experiments of quantum key distribution (QKD) using fainted sources (attenuated light pulses), were carried 
out  at  visible  or  near  infrared  wavelengths,  based  mainly  on  the  polarization  of  the  photons.  More  recently, 
experiments  at  telecommunications  wavelengths  have  been  reported,  introducing  the  coding  other  than  polarization, 
such  as  the  optical  phase  [1],  and  detection  by  photon  counting  with  cooled  avalanche  photodiodes  (APD)  [2].  
However these receivers present severe limitations in the present 1550 nm systems, due to their inherent low quantum 
efficiency and their high dark count rate, which requires an operation in the gated mode, resulting in a very low key 
generation rate even at low operation temperature [3].  
 
To obtain substantially higher key rates, homodyne detection constitutes an interesting alternative to photon counting, 
because when used with a local oscillator of suitable power for operation near the quantum noise limit, it provides the 
mixing  gain  to  overcome  the  thermal  noise,  while  employing  conventional  P.I.N.  photodiodes  operating  at  room 
temperature, that present a much higher quantum efficiency and response speed as compared to APD, as well as lower 
cost  and  simpler  supply  requirements  [4].  Homodyne  detection  has  already  been  investigated  to  provide  accurate 
quadrature measurements in QKD using continuous random variables [5]. 
 
Furthermore, the coherent detection technique allows a diversity of modulation formats of the optical carrier, which is 
important when multiple states of phase are required, such as MPSK for the quantum bit (Q-bit) modulation, like in the 
BB84 protocol. Thus the objective of our work is to use this type of reception in a super-homodyne configuration for 
this protocol. 
 
When homodyne reception is used for the detection of Q-bits, a balanced configuration must be carried out to reach the 
necessary quantum measuring accuracies; therefore one must extract, at Bob’s end, a reference of the optical carrier, to 
generate  the  local  field  that  provides  an  acceptable  mixing  gain.  Furthermore  the  receiver  must  be  designed  to 
accommodate with the random  phase  fluctuations in the channel due to the optical source at Alice’s end (in general 
fast)  and  to  the  thermo-mechanical  states  of  fibers  and  other  in-line  components  (in  general  slow,  but  introducing 
depolarizing effects as well). 
 

Post-detection,  filtering,  threshold  and  symbol  synchronization  stages  must  also  be  properly  designed  as  in 
homodyning the logical decision process is carried out after balanced photodetection, as opposed to photon counting 
that  inherently performs built-in decision. The  former leads to classical bit error rate (BER) while only quantum bit 
error rate (QBER) is considered in the latter.  
 
In this work we encode the Q-bits in two orthogonal bases with two antipodal symbols per base, leading to a QPSK 
modulation format; and we present two configurations for its measurement: first a self homodyne system that transmits 
a  strong  unmodulated  carrier  on  a  separate  fiber  as  the  demodulation  reference;  and  also  a  single  fiber  system  that 
introduces  high  power  pulses  of  the carrier  reference,  time  multiplexed  with  the  faint  pulses,  followed  by a  delayed 
interferometric  homodyne  reception.  This  differential  configuration  relaxes  the  polarization  and  phase  fluctuations 
conditions in the common channel, since an absolute stability is not required but only a relative stability during a few 
symbol periods.   
 
 

2.  QKD WITH QPSK FORMAT 

 
2.1  BB84 protocol 
 
In cryptographic communication it is mandatory to send the encrypted message and in a secure way the key to decrypt it. 
Quantum key distribution (QKD) permits the exchange of the key in a “quantum” channel, between Alice and Bob. This 
key  has  to  be  protected  from  Eve  that  tries  to  intercept  the  message.  The  protocol  is  a  group  of  strict  rules  that  is 
indispensable for a QKD system to be implemented as an unconditionally secure communication.  
 
The protocol proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984 (BB84) [6] uses some basic quantum concepts to operate. From 
two orthogonal bases chosen randomly by Alice, four quantum eigen states can be generated separately (the symbols 0 
and 1 on two different bases). Hence for the communication, Alice randomly chooses  her symbol with a random base 
before sending it to Bob; then Bob also chooses his base to read the received bit. Bob and Alice then talk in a classical 
channel to compare the chosen bases after a sequence of key bits have been received; a raw key is thus generated.  
 
When there is base coincidence, i.e., Bob and Alice choose the same base, the bit is correctly detected and when there is 
anti-coincidence, the measurement is random. The sequence obtained when there are base coincidences is kept, and then 
some of these bits are chosen to perform the eavesdropping test, i.e. privacy amplification. Alice and Bob compare these 
symbols  of  raw  keys  to  obtain  a  sifted  key,  which  is  then  used  for  the  encryption  of  the  message.  “One-Time  Pad” 
(Vernam Code) is usually employed in this kind of system as to avoid any eventual information leakage. 
 
To  guarantee  the  security  in  this  protocol  it  is  necessary  that  the  communication  be  done  at  quantum  levels,  ideally  1 
photon per transmitted bit. This can provide the unconditional security, since if Eve tries to read this unique photon, Bob 
will  be  aware  of  it  due  to  quantum  mechanics  principles,  otherwise  if  Eve  reads  it  and  the  retransmits  it,  the  error  is 
easily detected by the reconciliation procedure between Alice and Bob and the bit is discarded. [6] 
 
2.2  Generating QPSK for QKD 
 
The BB84 protocol requires Alice’s choice from two bases, and each base has two symbols. This permits four different 
parameter values. In an optical fiber scheme operating with phase  modulation, the symbols must have antipodal phase 
states in two conjugated bases, and the BB84 requirements can be met by positioning each of these four values as one of 
four points in a QPSK constellation. 
 
Hence  Alice  generates  4  different  phase  states  to  perform  this  task,  our  QKD  system  utilizes  a  two-electrode  Mach-
Zehnder electro-optical modulator (EOM), permitting the independent control in each electrode arm. With this kind of 
modulator the optical field undergoes variation both in amplitude and phase, depending on the signals introduced to each 
arm following the equation:

Bob also chooses his base, operating with the same kind of modulator as Alice (EOM-A for Alice and EOM-B for Bob), 
using only one electrode input, adds to the field a new phase variation permitting to extract the base choices and symbol 
information as established in the BB84 protocol. A table of Alice’s choices of bases and symbols and Bob’s choices of 
bases, as well as the key coincidence/anti-coincidence are shown in Fig. 1 (b) [7].

3.  EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP 

 
3.1  Self-homodyne receiver 
 
Our  first  experiment  to  validate  this  QPSK  QKD  system  consists  of  a  standard  telecommunications  optical-fiber  self-
homodyne system with a strong carrier “reference” transmitted in a separate optical line. The modulated signal arm was 
constructed to have EOM-A followed by an optical attenuator; Bob introduces his base choices in the reference arm at 
the reception, the setup is shown in Fig. 2. Alice and Bob apply their respective modulation signals, obtaining the same 
results and keys as in Fig. 1(b). The curve in Fig. 3(a) shows the detected signal when a square electrical signal is used 
for the modulation, the coincidence of bases between Alice and Bob are shown in the waveform as positive or negative 
levels, while the anti-coincidence are discarded (level 0); furthermore from the histogram, Fig. 3(b), we can observe the 
manifestation of the base coincidences (outer peaks) and anti-coincidences (inner peaks).

Strictly the protocol requires, for unconditional security, that the transmission is performed with 1 photon per bit, thus 
requiring  a  (non-existing  yet)  single  photon  source.  In  practice  we  use  an  attenuated  DFB  source,  which  follows  the 
Poissonian statistics, and a security level can be reached when an approximation of 0.1 photon/bit is used [5], at the cost 
of a quantity of empty pulses and of multi-photon pulses. Consequently we place the attenuator after Alice’s modulation 
to prepare the optical signal to a quantum level in order to assure the required security; in addition modulating the laser 
with narrow pulses can help provide a much lower number of photons per bit. Fig. 4 is an example of the same setup but 
with  very  weak  optical  level:  the  modulation  was  introduced  as  before.  The  waveform  that  can  be  seen  by  the 
oscilloscope,  Fig.  4(a),  shows  the  positive  or  negative  pulses  when  there  are  base  coincidences  and  zero  levels  when 
there are anti-coincidences. In addition from a histogram of received signals, Fig. 4(b), we can obtain the bit occurrence; 
and this time the base anti-coincidence bits are immersed in the noise. This result was obtained when the optical power 
was attenuated from 4.83×107 photon/bit (as shown in Fig. 3) to 3.8×104 photon/bit. 
 
The  first  self-homodyne  configuration  requires  the  transmission  in  two  fibers,  which  suffer  from  unequal  phase  and 
polarization fluctuations as the propagation distance increases. In addition, the “signal” and “reference” lines must be in 
absolute phase-alignment, which is technically very difficult to implement in a practical application.

3.2  The time-multiplexed Super-Homodyne configuration 
 
Our  second  homodyne  configuration  consists  of  sending  the  weak  QPSK-modulated  pulses  time-multiplexed  with  the 
unmodulated  strong  pulses  that  constitute  a  carrier  phase  reference  in  a  same  fiber  [8].  Fig.  5  is  a  diagram  of  our 
experimental setup: the coherent optical pulses are fed into Alice’s unbalanced interferometer, then Alice’s fainted pulses 
are  produced  in  her  longer  arm  with  EOM-A  as  mentioned  above,  while  strong  unmodulated  pulses  pass  through  the 
shorter arm, with accurate polarization control. The pulses are recombined after the interferometer and pass through 11 
km fiber arriving at Bob’s. The Alice’s detector as in Fig. 5 is used for monitoring the polarization control.

Decision 

 

 
At the receiver, Bob’s measurements are performed by applying his 2-state phase modulation to the strong pulses in a 
similar delayed interferometric configuration so that the weak key pulses beat with the high power reference pulses in 
order to achieve the mixing gain; then a balanced configuration is used for photodetection.  
 
The  extinction  ratio  is  a  determinant  element  in  the  time-multiplexing  setup.  The  pulses  in  the  “signal”  line  are  very 
weak in QKD application, generally 0.1—1 photon/symbol; therefore the finite extinction ratio of the “reference” pulses 
must be sufficiently high. 
 
Actually, the signal and the reference are set to mutually orthogonal polarizations when they are combined (at Alice) so 
as  to  avoid  interference;  and  rendered  to  the  same  polarizations  when  beating  with  each  other  (at  Bob)  in  order  to 
maximize the detected signal. Phase stability in the interferometer is another important factor which is dependant of the 
temperature  variation  and  the  internal  and  external  mechanical  vibrations.  The  unbalanced  interferometer  is  several 
meters long in our experimental setup. 
 
 
 
 
 

4.  MEASUREMENTS 

 
As Alice transmits single photon pulses and encodes the information in their phases, the detection of signal photons is 
essential for a practical QKD system. Because any background light in the fiber can increase the system noise level and 
limit its performance, high-sensitivity receivers are thus required  for detecting the very weak signals. Photon counting 
and homodyne detection are two available methods for detecting weak light. We will compare their characteristics and 
performances  in this section.  One technical  limitation  of the photon  counting  method  is that  at  present  there exists  no 
perfect  single  photon  source  and  no  efficient  photon  counter  either  for  telecom  wavelength  where  optical  loss  is 
minimized in an optical fiber. 
 
4.1  Photon counting receivers  
 
As  a  preliminary  experiment,  we  present  a  receiver  based  on  photon  counters  as  a  reference  for  comparison  with  our 
homodyne detection system. 
 
The usual way to improve signal photon sensitivity of an  APD is to operate in a Geiger Gate mode, when it is biased 
above  the  breakdown.  A  single  photon  can  then  trigger  an  avalanche  containing  millions  of  electrons  and  create  a 
macroscopic  current  pulse.  After  a  detection  event,  avalanche  is  quenched  and  gated  to  decrease  the  dark  count  and 
prepare the APD for the next multiplication, thus making the detection of single photon events possible. 
  
In  this  experimental  setup,  we  use  a  single-photon  detector  module  (SPDM  from  ID  Quantique)  which  offers  a  dark 
count below 100 counts per second and sub-nanosecond timing resolution [9].  
 
Fig.6 is an experimental setup for the photon counting system. The pulsed laser is attenuated to a quantum level before 
entering  the  system.  Since  EOM-A  and  EOM-B  have  the  same  insertion  loss,  we  apply  Alice’s  and  Bob’s  phase 
modulations both in the longer arm of the two unbalanced interferometers so that the pulses of ΦA and those of ΦB have 
the same intensity. Detector 1 clicks for ΦA-ΦB = 0 while Detector 2 clicks for ΦA-ΦB = π. When ΦA-ΦB = π/2 or -π/2, 
the photon arrives at Detector 1 or Detector 2 in a random way.

Fig. 6 QKD DQPSK Setup: Photon Counting Detection 

 
In this setup, the repetition frequency is set to 1MHz. The gate width is set to 2.5ns so as to minimize the dark counts 
which could be randomly triggered by carriers generated in thermal, tunneling or trapping processes taking place in the 
junction.  In  fact,  the  detectors  are  cooled  down  to  220K  to  reduce  the  occurrence  of  thermally  generated  carriers. 
Another  effect  to  be  taken  into  account  is  the  so-called  “afterpulses”  which  is  proportional  to  the  charge  crossing  the 
junction in an avalanche before the quenching process, since reducing the operation temperature of the APD increases 
also the lifetime of the trapped charge. Therefore a compromise  must be  made between the operation temperature and 
“deadtime” which inhibits gates for a while. This is also a reason why the maximum frequency of this SPDM is limited 
to  4MHz.  When  working  at  a  stable  temperature  of  220K,  the  quantum  efficiency  is  lower  than  10%,  since  the  dark 
count rate increases with quantum efficiency if a larger gate width is selected. 
 
When  using  a  fiber  interferometer  without  feedback  from  the  detected  signal,  a  mean  false  count  rate  of  30%  was 
obtained in a condition of stable phase for several minutes due to the finite visibility of the interferometer (which leads to 

a probability of a photon being misdirected to the wrong detector). 
 
The security of practical implementations of the photon counting scheme is limited by: a) the unsatisfactory extinction 
ratio of the reference pulses; b) the polarization imperfections of the laser pulse which affect the mixing of the weaker 
key  pulse  with  the  strong  reference  pulse;  c)  the  slight  deviation  of  modulating  signals;  d)  the  unavoidable  thermo-
mechanical variations; and e) the dark counts of the APD detectors. 
 
Intrinsic  problems  associated  with  the  high  gain  APD  are  high  amplification  noise  and  dark  current  noise.  The  low 
quantum  efficiency  and  the  high  probability  of  a  false  avalanche  due  to  dark  current  noise  preclude  many  practical 
applications. In addition, the single photon source adds to another bottleneck for photon counting detection [9], several 
research groups are dedicating to produce a practical signal photon source such as heralded single photon source (HSPS) 
which generates photon pairs. [11]

square  phase  fluctuations 
order of a few bit periods. 
 
Our system uses super-homodyne balanced detection for implementing the Bennett-Brassard BB84 protocol with QPSK 
coding. We have performed QKD by sending light pulses at 1.55µm through 11km propagation. 
 
As shown in Fig. 5, the light source is a 1.55µm coherent laser source (LMM Digital Electro-Absorption Laser Module 
from AVANEX) which generates the pulses of 10ns with dynamic extinction ratio > 10dB. Optical pulses are fed into an 
unbalanced interferometer: in its longer arm we produce Alice’s fainted QPSK signal. Strong unmodulated pulses pass 
through the short arm, as shown in Fig. 5, and are used as reference signal.  
 
Fig. 8(a) shows an example of the combination of weak modulated signal pulses and strong reference signal pulses after 
Alice’s  interferometer.  The  weak  modulated  signal  pulses  are  delayed  as  to  implement  a  time-multiplexing 
configuration.  
 

Fig. 7 Theoretical BER of Homodyne Detection 

 

 
At Bob’s end, 2-state phase modulation is applied in a similar delayed configuration so that the weak modulated pulse 
beats  with  the  strong  reference  pulse;  we  use  a  balanced  photoreceiver  to  perform  the  detection  which  has  a  high 
sensitivity and a high conversion gain.  
 
The  balanced  photoreceiver  consists  of  two  matched  InGaAs  photodiodes  and  a  low-noise  amplifier  that  generates  an 
output  voltage  proportional  to  I2-I1,  the  difference  between  the  photocurrents  in  the  two  photodiodes,  with 
transimpedance gain of 40V/ma. Fig. 8(b) shows Bob’s detected symbols after 11km fiber propagation using balanced 
detection.

The balanced  detection has several advantages over photon counting : a) Quantum  efficiency of P.I.N detector is near 
unity  which  is  much  higher  than  photo  counters;  b)  Balanced  configuration  helps  remove  common  mode  noise  issued 
from the electrical circuit of P.I.N detectors, besides it can extract the intensity difference between two received signals 
and  double  the  received  signal  amplitude;  c)  With  the  proper  reference  power,  shot  noise  is  the  only  limit  since  the 
strong  reference  pulse  makes  the  thermal  noise  irrelevant  (thermal  noise  is  -174dBm/Hz,  whereas in our experimental 

 

setup the quantum shot noise is -152dBm/Hz,); d) High speed QKD system is possible with super-homodyne balanced 
detection since P.I.N diodes do not require quenching process. 
 
Fig. 9(a) demonstrates Bob’s detected symbols with 2 photons per symbol, in which the system noise is limited to the 
shot noise level, as shown in Fig. 9 (b). However, the current fluctuation is still a bottleneck in the balanced detection. As 
shown  in  Fig.7  theoretically  we  can  reach  a  BER  less  than  0.3%  with  2  photons  per  symbol  with  super-homodyne 
detection, as for 1 photon per symbol BER could be around 2%.

The third term of the equation (10) is the afterpulsing probability from the starting avalanche event to the next avalanche

Fig.  10  shows  the  theoretical  performance  of  these  two  detection  configurations  over  80km  when  BER  of  photon 
counting configuration is calculated by equation (11), since we consider the erasure of photons as errors. The Dark Count 
Probability is 10-4 (100 dark counts/second when the repetition frequency is 1MHz), Bob’s loss is 4dB, QED is 6%, Np 
sent by Alice is 1 photon/bit.

Fig. 10 The performance of photon counting and homodyne detection 

 
The homodyne detection constitutes as a good alternative for QKD system: a) it doesn’t exhibit the dark counts which is 
dominant in photon counting configuration; b) in a practical point of view, its frequency limit is much higher because it 
is mainly related to the rise time of the InGaAs photodiodes; c) it works at an ambient temperature; d) it allows a variety 
of key encoding formats (phase and polarization modulation). 
 
 

 
An experimental QKD system for the BB84 protocol has been implemented using optical phase modulation for base and 
symbol encoding, including the transmission of a strong carrier reference that allows a variety of key encoding formats; 

5.  CONCLUSION 

we presented a QPSK modulation for the Q-bit with two detection configurations: a self-homodyne with an additional 
fiber for the strong reference, and a delayed homodyne scheme that uses only one fiber, with a time-multiplexed strong 
reference  pulses.  We  present  the  results  of  measurements  for  both  homodyne  configurations  using  balanced  P.I.N. 
detectors, and, as a comparison, results of the operation with photon counters. 

 

Future  work  is  to  be  done  on  the  carrier  phase  synchronization,  even  in  the  differential  system  that  requires  the 
quadrature conditions in the interferometer, as well as the polarization handling and the symbol clock synchronization.

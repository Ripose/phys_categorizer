Abstract 

Optical  transition  radiation  interferometry  (OTRI)  has  been  shown  to  be  a  very  useful  technique  to 

measure  the  divergence  of  electron  beams  with  energies  in  the  range  of  15-100  MeV.  However,  application 

of  this  method  to  low  energy  or  very  high  quality  beams  is  limited  by  scattering  in  the  front  foil  of  the 

interferometer.  To  overcome  this  limitation  we  propose  to  use  a  perforated  front  foil.    For  the  beam  energy 

and  hole  sizes  we  are  considering,  the  unscattered  beam  electrons  passing  through  the  holes  will  produce 

diffraction  radiation  (ODR).  The  total  radiation  produced  from  the  first  and  second  foils  then  will  be  a 

spatially  coherent  sum  of  ODR  and  OTR  from  unscattered  and  scattered  electrons.    By  controlling  the 

number  and  size  of  the  perforations,  the  inter-foil  spacing,  the  thickness  of  the  first  foil  and  the  wavelength 

and band pass of the observed radiation, the coherent interferences due to the unscattered portion of the beam 

can  be  isolated  and  observed.  The  visibility  of  these  interferences  can  then  be  used  to  determine  the  rms 

beam  divergence.  We  have  developed  a  general  computer  code  which  can  be  used  to  calculate  diffraction 

radiation  from  any  type  of  perforation  and  another  code  to  compute  the  ODR-OTR interference pattern for a 

given  set  of  beam  and  optical  parameters.  These  codes  are  employed  in  the  design  of  an  interferometer  to 

measure  the  divergence  of  the  ATF  accelerator  operating  at  30  MeV.  This  beam  will  be  used  in  an  initial 

proof  of  principle  experiment  for  the  ODR-OTR  interferometer.  We  present  the  results  of  our  code 

calculations which show that the expected divergence, 200 micro radians, can be easily measured.

1  INTRODUCTION 

A typical optical transition radiation (OTR) interferometer consists of two parallel thin foils, 

oriented at 45 degrees with respect to the electron beam. The beam produces forward directed OTR 

from the first foil and backward directed OTR from the second. When the distance between the foils 
is  comparable  to  the  vacuum  coherence  length  LV ~  g 2l 

, interferences between these two sources 

are observed; the visibility of the interference pattern is a function of the rms beam divergence [1].  

Scattering in the first foil of the interferometer limits this method when the beam divergence 

is  less  than  about  0.05g

-1

  or  when  scattering  in  the  first  foil  dominates  the  divergence.  Practically 

speaking,  the  latter  occurs  when  the  beam  energy  is  lower  than  about  10  MeV.    However,  even 

when the beam energy is larger, if the beam quality is very high,  the foil scattering may be sufficient 

to mask the real beam divergence. To overcome this limitation, we plan to use a perforated first foil 

as  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  hole  size  and  spacing  are  chosen  to  be  much  smaller  than  the  rms  beam 

size.  In  addition,  the  holes  are  sufficiently  small  and  numerous  so  that  significant  ODR  will  be 

produced.    The  conditions  for  significant  DR  production  are  (a)  the  characteristic  hole  dimensions 

a

gl

/ 2

p

, where  g  is the Lorentz factor of the beam and  l

 is the wavelength of the observed DR 

and (b) the transparency of the perforated foil is about 50%.  

The total output light intensity distribution observed from such a device will be the coherent 

sum of forward  directed ODR and OTR from the perforated foil and backward directed OTR from 

the second foil. There will be two contributions to the interference pattern ODR-OTR radiation: one 

from  the  unscattered  portion  and  the  second  from  the  scattered  portion  of  the  beam.  By proper the 

choice of front foil thickness, inter-foil spacing, hole size, number of holes, spacing of the holes and 

the  optical  band  pass,  the  interference  fringes  produced  by  the  unscattered  electrons  can  be  made 

clearly  visible  over  the  background  radiation  produced  by  the  scattered  portion  of  beam.  A 

sufficiently large scattering in the front foil will destroy the visibility of interferences produced by 

the  scattered  electrons,  rendering  a  smooth  background  radiation  pattern.  The  amount  of  scattering 

can  be  controlled  by  choosing  the  thickness  and  material  density  of  the  front  foil  for  the  particular 

beam  energy  and  the  range  of  beam  divergences  under  investigation.  The  rms  divergence  of  the 

unperturbed beam can then be determined by an analysis of the observed interference pattern riding 

above the scattered background.  

  Also,  as  with  conventional  OTR  interferometry  [1],  the  orthogonal  (x,  y)  components  of  the 

divergence can be separately obtained by observing the interferences with a polarizer and adjusting 

the  beam  focus  to  either  an  x  or  y  waist  condition.    In  addition  to  the  rms  divergences,  the 

 

2 

£
 

 

 

orthogonal  rms  emittances  of  a  non  space  charged  dominated  beam  can  be  determined  by  also 

measuring the rms beam waist sizes. This can be easily done experimentally by imaging the beam in 

OTR at the position of the second foil. 

 

2 APPROACH 

In  order  to  design  the  interferometer  to  be  sensitive  to  a  given  beam  divergence  we  have 

developed  two  computer  codes.    The  code  CONVOLUTION  convolves  the  total  intensity (see Eq. 

(3)  below)  with  the  transmission  function  of  the  optical  pass  band  filter  and  beam  angular 

distributions.  A second code BEAM DR is used to calculate the individual fields and intensities of 

ODR and OTR, which are inputs to code CONVOLUTION.   

BEAM DR is extremely general and powerful. It is capable of calculating DR from any type of 

hole,  for  any  position  of  the  electron  passing  through  the  hole  and  for  any  distribution  of  holes  in  a 

perforated  foil.  In  addition,  the  code  can  calculate  the  distribution  of  DR  at  any  distance  from  the 

radiating source.  

2.1 ODR - OTR Interferences – Code CONVOLUTION 

In  an  OTR  interferometer  the  electron  beam  passes  two  continuous  metallic  foils.  The  beam 

produces similar intense OTR from each foil. If the first foil is perforated, the radiation from the first 

foil is a mixture of ODR and OTR. In either case, when the second foil a highly conductive metallic 

mirror,  the  reflectivity  of  the  second  foil  is  essentially  unity  in  the  visible  part  of  the  spectrum  and 

the combined intensity of the radiation from the first (1) and second (2) foils can be written as:

where  q  is  the  observation  angle,  l  is  the  wavelength  of  the  observed  radiation,    I1(q)  =1/2

2(q),  I2(q) =1/2 E2

foils  (1)  and  (2),  respectively;  y

,  the  phase  shift  between  forward  ODR  produced  from  the  rear 

surface of foil (1) and backward OTR produced from the front surface of foil (2) is given by:

where  d  is  the  distance  between  the  foils,  b = V/c,  V   is the electron velocity, c is  the velocity of 
light  and  qe  is  the  trajectory  angle  of  the  electron.    When  the  phase  Y = p , the electron trajectory

angle  qe    << g-1  and  the  observation  angle   q  ~  g--1  <<  1, the distance  d  is equal to the familiar 
vacuum coherence length for TR given by  LV =  ( l/2p )/(g-2 + q 2 ).   

The term cosY  in Eq. (1) introduces angular interferences (fringes) which are modulated by 

the single foil intensity functions  I1,2.(q).  The visibility of these fringes can be very sensitive to any 

change in the electron trajectory angle  qe,. In comparison, the single foil intensity,  which is a slowly 

varying  function  of  q,  is  much  less  sensitive  to  divergence.    Note  that  fringes  (i.e.  the  function 
cosY ) also depends on  l, the wavelength of the observed radiation, whereas the functions I1,2 , for a 

highly reflective mirror, are nearly independent of wavelength. 

  In  order  to  experimentally  observe  the  fringe  modulation  with  good  visibility,  a  narrow 

band interference filter  must be used. To calculate the effect of this  filter on the observed intensity, 

the  pass  band  filter  function  must  be  convolved  with  Eq.  (1).    The  effect  of  the  electron  beam 

divergence on the total intensity can then be calculated by convolving the resultant function with the 

beam  angular  distribution,  e.g.  a  Gaussian  distribution  of  beam  angles.  Then,  by  comparing  the 

theoretical  convolved  patterns  with  measured  ones,  the  rms  divergence  of  the  beam  can  be 

determined. 

          A perforated foil with hole sizes and spacing much smaller than the beam size splits beam 

into  two  fractions:  unscattered  and  scattered.  The  forward  radiation  produced  by  the  unscattered 

portion of the beam is clearly diffraction radiation. These scattered electrons also produce transition 

radiation  in  the  solid  portion  of  the  foil.  However,  this  component  is  strongly  affected  by  the 

presence of neighboring holes and can also be considered as a form of diffraction radiation as well.  

We will therefore refer to the radiation from  all the electrons in the perforated foil as DR or ODR in 
the  remainder  of  this  paper.    Since  the  second  foil  (2)  is  continuous  and  large  compared  to  g

l/2p

, 

the radiation from it is normal optical transition radiation (OTR).  

The total x or y component of the two foil light intensity can then be written as:

angular  intensities  radiated  by  beam  fractions  from  the  second  continuous  foil  and  are  independent 

of the  spatial distribution of the beam.  However, the ODR intensity  I1U(q) and  I1S(q) produced by

2.2   Optical Diffraction Radiation – Code BEAM DR 
          The  code  BEAM  DR  calculates  the  fields  and  intensities  of  ODR  produced  by  an  electron 

passing through a perforated foil at any position in the hole.  The model which is used in BEAM DR 

is  the  wave  optics  model.  This  model  is  attractive  because  it  is  naturally  applicable  to  both  the 

perforated holes and surrounding conductive surfaces and allows one to arrive at the solution for the 

fields at the observation point directly from the sources fields. As a result the code is quite fast and 

details  of  the  source  structure  can  be  taken  into  account  directly  without  any  approximation.  This 

code can naturally calculate the OTR fields and intensities for a continuous foil as well. 

              In the case of a perfectly conducting target the fields  inside  the  conductor  are  zero.  For 

simplicity  let  us  consider  a  plane  electromagnetic  wave  normally  incident  on  conducting  surface. 

The  boundary  conditions  for  the  electric  and  magnetic  field  components  Erx  and  Bry can be written 

as: Ex  = 0 and By = Jx,  the  induced  surface current  on the foil which is the source for the emitted 

radiation.  If  the  target  is  a  flat  polished  mirror,  the  surface  current  can  be  replaced  by  an  image 

wave,  which  is  incident  on  the  mirror  surface  from  inside  the  conductor.  The  image  wave  is 

constructed  in  such  a  way  that  superposition  of  electric  an  magnetic  fields  Erx  ,  Bry  of  the  real 

incident  wave  and  Eix  ,  Biy  of  the  image  wave  on  the  surface  of  the  mirror  satisfies  the  boundary 

conditions.  In this  case  the  boundary  conditions can be  written  as:  Erx + Eix = 0 and Bry = Biy.  The 

field  components  of  the  equivalent    image  wave    are:  Eix =  -Erx  and Biy = Bry. The image wave in 

this  case  is  the  mirror  image  of  the  real  wave.  The  field  of  the  image  wave  on  the  surface  of  the 

mirror is considered to be a Huygens source field. The spatial distribution of scattered or secondary 

radiation can than be calculated by using the Huygens Fresnel Integral:

area of the source field distribution and  ux,y is  the complex field component of the source field [2].

       The electron electromagnetic field can be presented as superposition of Fourier waves traveling 

along  electron  trajectory.    The    amplitude  of    the  frequency  -  longitudinal  wave  number  Fourier

.    In  the  wave  optics  model  the  Fourier  components  of  the  electron’s  field  are 

monochromatic  azimuthally  symmetric  plane  waves  propagating  along  electron  trajectory  without 

divergence (non radiating). If this wave is incident on a metallic mirror it induces a non-zero current 

on  the  mirror  surface  with boundary conditions  Er  =  0  and 

.    These  boundary  conditions

will be satisfied if the image wave fields are:  Eri = -Ere  and

. The image wave in this 

case  is  the  mirror  image  of  the  primary  wave  provided  by  the  moving  field  of  the  electron.  This 

image  wave  can  be  considered  as  a  wave    produced  by  a  positive  image  charge  traveling  as  the 

mirror  image  of  the  electron.  As  the  result,  backward  radiation  is  produced  in  the  direction  of 

specular  reflection  of  the  incident  wave  from  the  mirror.  For  a  continuous  surface  this  radiation  is 

the familiar backward reflected transition radiation; in the case of a foil with a hole, it is backward 

diffraction radiation. In the latter case, the radiation is the reflection of the electron’s field from the 

metallic  portion  of  the  foil,  and  the  surface  current  is  induced  by  the  fields  of  the  electron  on  the 

conducting surface.  For illustration, a sketch of the electron, image and radiation waves is presented 

in Figure 2. for the case of a continuous surface. 

Figure  2  also  shows  the  wave  picture  for  forward  TR,  which  is  produced  by  an  electron 

emerging  from  the  metal  foil.  In  this  case  the  situation  is  a  little  more  complicated.    The  boundary 

conditions  in the metal foil can be written as:  Er = 0 and 

, because now all the fields are

zero  on  the  left  side  of  the  boundary  (i.e.  inside  the  metal).    The  fields  of  the  image  wave  which 

satisfies these conditions are:  Eri = -Ere and 

=-

BB
j
ie

=
J
j
r

.  The fields of the image wave are the 

same as those of the primary wave but with reversed sign. The image wave in this case is equivalent 

to  the  field  of  a  positive  electron  moving  in  the  same  direction  as  a  real  electron  inside  the  metal. 

Note that the image of the charged particle placed inside the metal is an oppositely charged particle 

located at the same point.   As a result the source of forward TR is the forward directed image wave 

 

6 

 

 

 

field traveling along the electron trajectory.  Note again  that the actual source of the forward TR is 

the induced surface current.  

The total field in free space is superposition of free space electron and TR fields. In the case of 

forward  TR  the  resulting  fields  are  zero  near  the  foil,  and  the  total  electromagnetic field increases 

along  the  electron  trajectory.  The  OTR  field  gradually  diverges  and  the  electron’s  field  is 

reestablished  at  some  distance  from  the  foil,  i.e.  the  vacuum  formation  or  coherence  length.  In the 

case  of  DR  the  situation  is  the  same  for  TR  except  the  source  currents  of  DR  are  confined  to  the 

metal portion of the surface, i.e. there is no radiation from the hole. In other terms, the image waves 

are  limited  to  the  portion  of  screen  surrounding  the  aperture.  Thus  backward  and  forward  DR  are 

produced by a position electron image wave surrounding the hole. 

       We  developed  two  versions  of  the  BEAM  DR  code.  Version  (1)  calculates  the  angular 

distribution  of  diffraction  radiation  (i.e.  the  far  field  or  radiation  zone  solution);  version  (2) 

calculates the spatial distribution of DR observed on a flat screen placed at an arbitrary distance from 

the source. BEAM DR automatically satisfies Babinet principle for complex field amplitude because 

the solution is the integral over the source surface where non-zero field is attributed only to the metal 

portion of the foil (i.e. the hole is not a source) [3].   Our code results show that in special cases, for 

example,  DR  from  a  disk  or  circular  hole  in  a  metallic  screen  when  the  electron  travels  directly 

through the center, or TR from a continuous screen, that the complex field solution can be presented 

in a simple, real form.  Both these cases are represented in Figure 3. where the angular distribution 

of the radial component of the radiated electric field in real form is shown. 

  

Figure 3. shows the electric field for various conditions. The solid line shows the electric field  

produced  from  a  continuous  metal  target  (OTR),  the  dotted  line  shows  the  DR  field  observed  from 
and  the 
an  electron  passing  through  the  center  of  a  metal  disk  with  the  radius    a  =  1/  a

 =  g

l/2p , 

dashed line is the DR field produced from  a hole with the same radius.  In accordance with Babinet’s 

Principle,  the  sum  of  the  fields  from  the  disk  and  hole  add  to  give  the  field  from  the  continuous 

surface  (dot-dashed  line).  The  sum  overlaps  the  OTR  solid  line  exactly.    We  have  additionally 

verified  that  the  code  solution  for  OTR  is  independent  of  wavelength,  and  that  the  intensity  as  a 
  is  proportional  to  g 2  in  accordance  with  the  well-known 
function  of  angle  measured  in  unit  of   g

-1 

properties of OTR. 

          Figure 4. shows the  x polarized DR intensity produced by a single edge metallic foil with its 

edge  parallel  to  the  y  direction.    The  solid  line  in  Figure  4.  corresponds  to  OTR;  the  dotted  line 

corresponds  to DR radiation  produced  when the electron is at the edge;  the dashed line is DR from 
an electron located at a distance  l =  +0.75/a

  (i.e. inside the foil);  and  the dot-dashed line is DR 

7 

 
from an electron located at a distance l  =  - 0.75/a

  (i.e. outside from the foil).  Figure 4. shows that 

the  intensities  of  the  latter  two  DR  intensities  at  zero  angle  of  observation  are  identical.    The  code 
solution for the fields indicates that the phase shift of the corresponding DR fields is p

.  This result is 

another demonstration of Babinet’s principle.      

            BEAM DR also allows us to calculate field and intensity distributions on a flat screen placed 

at any distance L from the  source.    In  this case  the  shape of distribution additionally depends on L. 

To verify  the code  we  compared the code calculations to the analytic results of Verzilov [4].  To do 

this we calculated the OTR intensity distribution on a flat screen for three values of distance,  L=10 
LR , L=LR and  L=0.1 LR, where LR =  g /a

 is the OTR analog of   the Rayleigh length in wave optics. 

The  results  are  shown  in  Figure  5.  The  calculations,  which  were  done  in  the  same  units  as  those 

presented in Figure 3. of Ref. [4] are in excellent agreement with analytic results in all cases.  

Additional  comparisons  of  BEAM  DR  calculations with analytic far field DR solutions that 

are available for a circular aperture [2], a slit [3] and a single edge[5] show excellent agreement as 

well. 

3 APPLICATION OF CODES TO THE DESIGN OF AN ODR-OTR INTERFEROMETER 

BEAM DR and CONVOLUTION were  used to design an interferometer, which is capable of 

measuring the divergence of the Brookhaven National Laboratory’s ATF accelerator operating at 30 

MeV.  The  measured  normalized  emittance  of  ATF  is  approximately  1  micron  so  that  the  local 

divergence for a beam size of 100 microns at 30 MeV is about 200 micro radians [6]. 

3.1.   BEAM DR Code Results 

Code BEAM DR was used to accurately calculate the DR fields and intensity from a mesh with 

rectangular  perforations.  The  period  of  the  rectangular  holes  was  25.8 microns and the holes were 

16.8 X 16.8 microns in size. The ratio of the area of holes to the foil area is 0.42. The calculations 

were  done  for  foil  oriented  at  an  angle  of  45  degrees  with  respect  to  the  direction  of  the  electron 

beam. Figure 6. gives a schematic view of a section of the perforated foil, showing the array of holes 

and,  for  illustration,  the  position  and  fields  of  an  unscattered  electron,  which  is  traveling  near  the 

upper left hand corner of one of the holes. 

The  code  calculates  the  backward  radiation  fields  observed  in  a  plane  (X,Y),  which  is 

perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  specular  reflection  of  the  incident  electron  wave  field,  i.e.  at  90 

degrees  with  respect  to  the  velocity  of  the  electrons.    The  projected  angles  of  observation  onto this 
plane, scaled in units of g

-1  , are  X = g qx and Y= gqy .

3.2  CONVOLUTION Code Results 

The results of CONVOLUTION code are presented in Figure 8. for an observation wavelength 

 = 650 nm, filter pass band  D
=  0.03 , foil separation L  = 30mm and a beam divergence due to 
scattering  in  foil  (1),  s S  =  10  mrads.  Under  these  conditions  the  scattering  destroys  the  spatial 

l/l 

coherence  (interference  fringes)  of  the  radiations  from  foils  (1)  and  (2)  produced  by  the  scattered 

portion of  the beam, and the radiations sum to form a smooth background (

unscattered beam divergences  s U = 0 , 0.2  and 0.4 mrad are shown  in Figure 8. The results indicate 
that  the  expected  divergence,  s

  =  200  micro  radians,  can  be  readily  determined  with  such  an 

interferometer. 

4 EXPERIMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 

The  experiment  proposed  is  to  use  an  ODR-OTR interferometer  to  measure the divergence of 

the  ATF  accelerator  operating  at  30  MeV,  using  experimental  methods  that  have  been  successfully 

employed used by us in conventional OTRI.  The charge per pulse (0.5nC) for the ATF accelerator is 

the same for beams with which we have had success in these types of measurements previously. The 

position of the interferometer will be placed such that the beam can be focused (x and y) to a waist 

condition at the site of the interferometer. Polarized interferometry can then be used to measure the x 

and y divergences of the beam. 

5 CONCLUSIONS 

We  have  shown  using  simulation  codes  that  the  measurement  of  the  divergence  of  a  low 

energy low emittance, non-space charged dominated electron beam can be made using  a perforated 

foil ODR-OTR interferometer. With the  proper proportion of holes to solid material and size of the 

perforations,  interference  fringes  produced  by  ODR  and  OTR  from  unscattered  electrons  passing 

through the perforations of the first foil have been shown to be clearly visible above the incoherent 

background radiation from the scattered portion of the  beam.  A  proof  of  principle  experiment using 

the  ATF  30  MeV  accelerator  is  now  being  designed  to  validate  these  code  predictions.  This  new 

technique could be very useful to measure the divergence of low  energy, high quality beams such as

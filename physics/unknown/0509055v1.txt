We  study  the  impedance  spectra  of  woodwind  instruments  with  arbitrary  axisymmetric  geometry.  We 
perform  piecewise  interpolations  of  the  instruments’  profile,  using  interpolating  functions  amenable  to 
analytic  solutions  of  the  Webster  equation.  Our  algorithm  optimizes  on  the  choice  of  such  functions, 
while  ensuring  compatibility  of  wave  fronts  at  the  joining  points.  Employing  a  standard  mathematical 
model of a single-reed mouthpiece as well as the time-domain reflection function, which we derive from 
our impedance results, we solve the Schumacher equation for the pressure evolution in time. We make 
analytic checks that, despite the nonlinearity in the reed model and in the evolution equation, solutions are 
unique and singularity-free.

Introduction 

radiated  pressure, 

In this work we study the impedance spectrum and the 
time  evolution  of 
for  wind 
instruments  with  a  single  reed.  The  subject  has  been 
studied  widely  in  the  literature,  from  a  number  of 
different  points  of  view  (for  a  recent  overview  of 
different approaches, see [1]). Regarding the impedance 
spectrum, our focus is on different interpolations of the 
horn’s  profile.  More  specifically  we  are  interested  in 
interpolations  that  lead  to  analytic  solutions  of  the 
Webster  equation,  without  any  mismatch  of  the  wave 
fronts  at  segment  boundaries.  We  consider  different 
criteria  for  establishing  an  optimal  interpolation  and 
compare  our  results  with  standard  piecewise  conical 
approximations. In particular, we examine the effects of 
the  interpolation  on  impedance  and  on  resonance 
frequencies, presenting also the temperature dependence 
of our results. We use a Dolnet clarinet as our prototype 
example. 

To test our results on impedance, we apply them to the 
calculation  of  radiated  pressure  as  a  function  of  time. 
This  relies  on  solving  numerically  the  Schumacher 
equation  [2],  which  is  a  convolution-type  equation  in 
real  time.  Input  ingredients  for  this  equation  are  the 
reflection  function  in  the  time  domain,  which  can  be 
derived  from  the  numerical  results  on  the  impedance 
spectrum, as well as a mathematical description for the 
mouthpiece. Such a description is provided by a widely 
used model [3], applicable to single reed instruments.  

Given  that  the  model  is  nonlinear,  we  carry  out  an 
analytic  investigation  of  the  time  evolution,  to  ensure 
that  we  are  not  led  to  any  unphysical  singularities  or 
bifurcations. 

The outline of the paper is as follows: Section 2 sets up 
basic  definitions  and  notation,  and  gives  the  various 
analytical  solutions  to  the  Webster  equation,  together 

with  the  corresponding  impedance  ratios.  Section  3 
discusses  an  optimal  interpolation  and  presents  results 
of  the  numerical  calculations,  showing  the  effect  of 
temperature  and  of  different  interpolations  on  the 
impedance  spectrum.  Section  4  applies  the  impedance 
results to the calculation of radiated pressure. It presents 
numerical results for the reflection function in the time 
domain,  comparing  different  interpolations,  and  results 
on pressure, as a function of time.

For  typical  values  of  the  temperature  Τ  (oC)  and 
“standard” air composition, the speed of sound c and the 
density of air ρ behave as:  

c = 332 (1 + 0.00166 Τ) m / s                   (2) 
ρc = 428 (1 - 0.0017 Τ) kg / m2 / s                 (3)

Integrating

gives  the  volume  flow  U(t).  The  effect  of  thermal 
conduction and viscosity is commonly incorporated into 
a redefinition of the wave number k, in terms of a phase 
velocity u and an attenuation factor α :   k → ω/u – j α 

In  a  musical  instrument,  viscosity  and  heat  conduction 
are localized on boundary layers of thickness δν and δt, 
respectively. Their approximate effect on u and α is:

Inside  a  horn  of  arbitrary  axisymmetric  shape,  the 
variation  of  pressure 
to  be 
longitudinal,  with  wave  fronts  which  are  axisymmetric 
surfaces  perpendicular  to  the  walls;  these  surfaces  are 
essentially  spherical  (exactly  so,  for  a  conical  horn). 
Denoting  by  S(x)  the  surface  area  of  a  wave  front 
intersecting  the  axes  at  point  x,  the  wave  equation 
reduces to the so-called Webster equation:

This equation cannot be analytically solved for arbitrary 
profiles f(x); typically one must separate the horn into a 
sequence  of  segments,  and  interpolate  each  segment 
with a profile which is amenable to an analytic solution. 

There  are  three  types  of  horn  profiles  solving  the 
Webster equation analytically:   

i)  Conical profile: a(x)=a0+Tx  
This  is  the  most  widely  studied  case.  The  two 
independent solutions of the Webster equation are:

Since  this  profile  depends  on  two  parameters  only, 
using it as an interpolation in a segment will match the 
actual profile, but not its derivative, at the endpoints of 
the segment. This will lead to an undesirable mismatch 
of wave fronts in adjacent segments. 
ii)  “Bessel” profile: α(x) = b (x-x0)-ε  ≡  b ∆x-ε

The presence of  a  third parameter  in  the  profile  allows 
for derivative matching and thus closes the gap between 

adjacent wave fronts. Nevertheless, this functional form 
is too restrictive to fit most realistic profiles, requiring, 
e.g., that both the profile and its slope be monotonic. 

iii)  “Transcendental” profile: 

By this we denote profiles having either a sinusoidal or 
hyperbolic form:  

α(x)=a0(cos mx + T sin mx)                 (12a) 
α(x)=a0(cosh mx + T sinh mx)               (12b)

The positive (negative) sign in front of m2  corresponds 
to  the  sinusoidal  (hyperbolic)  case.  While  a  sinusoidal 
form cannot be applied to a horn profile as a whole, it is 
indispensable  for  the  description  of  concave  segments 
(f”(x) < 0), which are typically present.

Thus, to calculate the input impedance ZIN of a horn we 
iterate over segments, starting from the flare (right end), 
once a suitable interpolation for each segment has been 
established. Impedance matching on the right edge of a 
segment  gives  the  ratio  γ2/γ1  via  Eq.(17),  while  the 
impedance at the left edge is obtained through Eq.(16). 

Deciding on the optimal interpolation for each segment 
requires a detailed investigation, which we address next.

The profile of a horn is typically described though a set 
of  values  of  the  horn  radius  corresponding  to  selected 
locations  along  the  horn’s  symmetry  axis.  At  all  other 
locations,  the  profile  must  be  smoothly  interpolated. 
The  general  problem  of  interpolation  is  certainly  a 
widely  studied  area  in  Applied  Mathematics,  where 
standard  sets  of  functions  (polynomial  splines,  Padé 
approximants, etc.) are typically used; the difference in 
this  context  is  the  requirement  to  use  only  those 
functional  forms  which  lead  to  analytic  solution  of  the 
Webster equation, as described in Section 2. 

The simplest approximation is the conical one, in which 
the profile is made up of adjacent straight line intervals, 
joined  together  at  their  endpoints;  the  horn  is  thus  a 
concatenation  of  straight  conical  sections.  Despite  the 
mismatch in wave fronts, this approximation is the most 
standard one and will be used as a point of comparison 
in testing other interpolations. 

The  remaining  available  functional  forms  (Bessel, 
transcendental)  contain  an  extra  (third)  free  parameter; 
two  parameters  are  then  used  up  in  order  to  match  the 
prescribed values of the radius at the two endpoints of a 
segment  and  the  third  parameter  can  be  tuned  so  as  to 
affect the slope of the profile. There are many ways of 
adjusting  the  slope  and  one  must  use  some  criterion  in 
order  to  select  the  optimal  one.  One  family  of 
algorithms  which  we  tested  involves  visiting  each 
segment  in  sequence,  and  matching  its  slope  to  that  of 
the previous segment, at their common endpoint. Thus, 
if fL and fR are the prescribed values of the profile at the 
two  endpoints  xL,  xR,  of  a  segment,  and 
Rf ′   is  a 
prescribed  value  of  the  slope  at  the  right  end,  we  have 
three equations to solve for the three parameters.

Improved interpolations 

The algorithms described above, although they lead to a 
continuous  profile  with  continuous  first  derivative 
throughout  the  horn’s  length,  can  be  unstable,  since  a 
small change in the slope of one segment may propagate 
and get amplified in the slopes of subsequent segments, 
leading to the appearance of unphysical deformations in 
the horn’s profile. We have tried a number of variants of 
this  approach,  starting  from  either  the  mouth  or  the 
throat of the horn, or from a middle segment. 

Next we tried a variant of the above algorithms which is 
parallel,  rather  than  sequential,  in  the  segments,  and 
thus  avoids  any  accumulation  of  deformations.  The 
basic idea in this variant is to render each segment more 
and more concave or convex in a gradual manner, so as 
to  realize  a  better  match  at  end  points.  The  procedure 
stops  when  further  improvement  of  matching  in  one 
endpoint  spoils  matching  at  the  other  endpoint.  This 
variant, while it avoids accumulation of any unphysical 
deformations,  does  not  lead  to  an  exact  matching  of 
wave fronts, especially near inflection points. 

Our  final  interpolation  algorithm,  at  the  expense  of 
being more complicated, avoids the above problems: It 
is  parallel  and  leads  to  exact  derivative  matching 
throughout. In particular, we take a weighted average of 
the straight line slopes on both sides of a junction point 
and  require  that  the  derivatives  of  the  interpolating 
functions  on  either  side  of  the  junction  match  this 
average. Our algorithm, in a nutshell, works as follows: 

▪ Each segment [xL, xR] is split into two subsegments at 
some  intermediate  point  x0,  to  be  determined.  In  each 
subsegment, a hyperbolic (or sinusoidal, according to a 
certain criterion) interpolating function FL,R(x) is used. 

▪ Matching of profile values and derivatives is required 
at  xL,  x0,  xR.  This  amounts  to  six  conditions  on  the  six 
interpolating parameters.

▪  The  correct  choice  of  hyperbolic  versus  sinusoidal 
interpolating  function  can  be  elucidated  based  on 
 the straight line slope in the

Our  algorithms  for  determining  the  optimal  inter-
polations have been worked out in Mathematica, and are 
available from the authors upon request. They have the 
form  of  a  module  which  takes  as  input  a  list  of  profile 
values  at  different  points  along  the  horn’s  axis,  and 
returns lists of interpolating functions for each segment. 
The  difference  between  the  conical  and  our  optimized 
transcendental  interpolation  is  exemplified  in  Figure  2, 
which  shows  a  detail  from  the  profile  of  a Dolnet  type 
clarinet, around a junction point. 

3.3 Results on impedance 

All  of  our  results  refer  to  a  Dolnet  type  of  clarinet. 
Figure  3  exhibits  the  spectrum  of  the  impedance  using 
the conical approximation. Figure 4 gives a comparison 
of  conical  and  exponential  approximations,  as  regards 
impedance.  Differences  in  impedance  are  relatively 
small, of the order of 2% (10%) for the real (imaginary)

two approximations are practically identical (< 0.5 Hz).

the 
impedance  as  a  function  of  frequency  and 
temperature.  The  effect  of  these  parameters  is  viewed 
clearly  from  a  top  view,  as  in  Figure  7.  One  observes 
that impedance maxima are displaced with temperature, 
and more so at higher frequencies. Figure 8 exhibits the 
variation of lowest resonances with temperature. 

4  Mouthpiece  model  –  Reflection 
function – Schumacher’s equation 

We employed a standard mathematical description of a 
single-reed mouthpiece [3], which is quite realistic and 
simple.  Some  other  recent  investigations  are:  [5,6]  and 
references therein. The model is seen in Figure 9.

If  Pm  is  the  static  pressure  in  the  player’s  mouth,  the 
acoustic  flow  U(t)  entering  the  instrument  is  related  to 
the pressure difference Pm – p(t) by Bernoulli’s law

Our algorithm for time evolution proceeds as follows: 

▪ At time t = t1 (and at all previous times  0 ≤ t < t1) the 
values of UIN(t1), Ur(t1), U(t1), p(t1) and y(t1) are known 

▪ From Eqs.(26), (27) we find Ur(t2),  y(t2)  (t2 = t1+∆t) 

▪ Substituting in Eq.(28) we calculate p(t2) 
For  the  correct  functioning  of  the  algorithm  we  must 
investigate  which  are  the  proper  initial  conditions, 
compatible with the physical model. We find for p(0):

The nonlinearity in the reed model raises the possibility 
of  singularities  and  bifurcations  in  the  solutions.  We 
have  performed  a  thorough  analytic  check  that  such 
pathologies  will  never  be  present.  Figure  10  compares 
the  conical  and  transcendental  interpolations, regarding 
our  results  for  r(t).  A  smoother  behavior  is  observed 
coming from the transcendental interpolation. Figure 11 
displays the pressure evolution in time; one can observe 
transient phenomena at initial times. Differences among 
various interpolations are not perceptible on this scale. 

While the observed differences among the various types 
of  interpolation  which  we  have  examined  are  small, 
they  are  expected  to  be  more  pronounced  in  pipes  of

more  complicated  geometry. 
important  to  examine  transverse  variations  in  pressure 
and  to  carry  over  a  similar  approach  to  pipes  with 
bends.  Similarly,  the  effect  of  finger  holes  should  be 
dealt  with  in  a  more  precise  way  than  standard 
treatments.  A  full  fledged  three  dimensional  treatment

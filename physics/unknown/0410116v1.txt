New experimental results from the multimirror trap GOL-3 are presented. Deuterium plasma of ~1021 m-3 
density is heated by a high power relativistic electron beam (peak parameters are ~1 MeV, ~25 kA, ~8 m s, ~120 
kJ). Magnetic system of the facility is a 12-meter-long axisymmetrical solenoid with corrugated magnetic field, 
which consists of 55 cells with Bmax/Bmin=4.8/3.2 T. Collective plasma heating by the electron beam results in 
peak  electron  temperature  ~2  keV.  To  this  time  the  ions  are  also  collectively  heated  by  gradients  of  electron 
pressure in the cells of the trap. Ion temperature increases above 1 keV and confines at the high level for ~1 ms. 
Dense hot plasma in GOL-3 trap emits D-D neutrons for ~1 ms.  

Details of collective plasma heating by the beam in the corrugated magnetic field will be presented in the 
paper. New physical mechanism of effective heating of plasma ions, substantially dependent on the corrugation 
of the magnetic field, is discussed. Experiments with complete multimirror configuration of the GOL-3 facility 
have  shown  the  significant  improvement  of  energy  confinement  time  comparing  with  simple  solenoidal 
configuration.  Axial  currents,  which  exist  in  the  system,  cause  sheared  helical  structure  of  the  magnetic  field. 
The safety factor q is shown to be below unity on the axis. 
 

Introduction  

Multimirror confinement of hot dense plasma in a long open trap is studied at GOL-3 facility in Novosibirsk 

[1].  The  multimirror  trap  consists  of  a  set  of  mirrors,  which  are  connected  to  each  other  at  their  ends.  Full 
solenoid length L exceeds mean free path of the particles l . If, at the same time, the mirror cell length l<l

 then 

the longitudinal confinement time increases essentially compared to classical single mirror trap due to diffusion-

like plasma expansion (see review [2]).  

This  paper  covers  our  new  experiments  with  multimirror  magnetic  system  at  GOL-3 
facility  with  the  main  focus  on  features  of  the  plasma  heating.  The  plasma  is  heated  by  an 

electron  beam  up  to  keV-range  temperatures  due  to  non-classical,  collective  processes. 

Plasma stability and confinement depends on the structure of the magnetic field, which is also 

formed under conditions of anomalous collisionality.  

The  current  of  the  injected  electron  beam  exceeds  significantly  the  Kruskal-Shafranov 

limit for kink stability. This problem of stable transportation of the beam in the long plasma 

system was solved by preparation of adequate preliminary plasma with high enough compen-
sating return current. In the case of a significant decay of the return current the helicity of the 
magnetic  field  changes  sign  and  the  safety  factor  q  falls  below  unity  in  the  plasma  core. 
Measurements suggest that this is the case at least during the beam phase of the discharge. 

 

GOL-3 Facility 

GOL-3 facility is a long open trap intended for study of heating and confinement of a relatively dense (1021

l023 m-3) plasma in axisymmetrical magnetic system [1]. The magnetic system consists of coils for transport and 

shaping of the electron beam, a 12-meter-long solenoid and an exit unit (which includes plasma creation system, 

expander and exit receiver of the beam and plasma). The solenoid consists of 55 cells of 22 cm length each with

(0.2‚ 5)(cid:215) 1021 m-3 density is created by a special linear discharge

heating is provided by a high-power electron beam (~1 MeV, 
30 kA, 8 m s) with total energy content of 120‚ 150 kJ.

the plasma and excites a high level turbulence in it. As a result 

of  collective  interactions,  the  electron  distribution  function 

becomes  essentially  a  nonequilibrium  one.  The  bulk  of 

electrons  is  heated  up  to  average  energies  (temperature)  of 
1‚ 2 keV,  the  tail  extends  up  to  the  beam  energy  [3].  In  this 

case the spatial anisotropy of the electron distribution function 

is  observed:  the  "axial"  mean energy of electrons exceeds by 

several  times  the  "radial"  one.  The  suprathermal  electrons  keep 

the major part of energy left by the beam in the plasma. The beam 

energy  release  is  nonuniform  along  the  system  length.  Fig.2 

shows  the  axial  distribution  of  specific  plasma  energy  for  two 

operation  regimes.  Dependence  a)  corresponds 
to  a  high 
temperature regime with rather low density (0.2‚ 0.5)(cid:215) 1021 m-3, b) 
corresponds to a high density regime (4‚ 5)(cid:215) 1021 m-3. It is seen that

in  the  high-T  regime  there  is  the  pressure  peak  at  a  distance  of

dependence is smoother. 

As  a  result  of  the  beam-plasma  collective  interaction  the 

effective collision frequency of plasma electrons exceeds by three 

orders  the  classical  Coulomb  collision  frequency.  Consequences  of  this  [4]  are  that  the  plasma  electrical 

conductivity and its longitudinal electron thermal conductivity decreased substantially. All the mentioned above 

phenomena  enable  a  possibility  to  form  the  high  pressure  gradients along the magnetic field and macroscopic 

motion of a plasma. As a result, fast heating of ions is observed in GOL-3 [5]. 

 

Fast Heating of Ions (Model and Experiment) 

A  model  for  explanation  of  fast  ion  heating  in  a  multimirror  trap  was  proposed  (see  [5]).  It  takes  into 

account  the  following:  a)  a  nonuniform  plasma  heating  (which  depends  on  the  nb/np  ratio,  i.e.  on  the  local 

magnetic field); b) suppression of heat transport during the heating phase that enables high pressure gradients; c) 

collective  acceleration  of  plasma  flows  from  the  high-field  part  of  corrugation  cells  to  cell’s  ‘bottom’;  d) 

thermalization  of  the  opposite  ion  flows.  The  model  predicts  occurrence  of  strong  modulation  of  density  and 

velocities of ions in the trap after several microseconds of beam injection. This mechanism of ion heating was 
studied  with  a  Thomson  scattering  system  (10 J,  1.06 m m),  which  was  used  to  measure  an  8-point  ne(r) 

distribution.  Shot-to-shot  spread  of  the  plasma  density  is  below  10%  during  several  first  microseconds  of  the 
beam  injection.  Then  the  density  spread  becomes  larger,  up  to d n/n~40% (Fig.3). Measurements of a neutron 
emission intensity (Fig.4) show that first neutrons are detected in 2‚ 3 m s after beginning of the beam injection 
and then a powerful flash of neutron radiation takes place in 4‚ 8 m s. Axial distribution of the pressure (Fig.2) in 

general  corresponds  to  distribution  of  neutron  emission  along  the  trap  length.  There  is  a  pressure  peak  at  a 

distance  of  about  1 m  from  the  input  mirror.  At  this  point  a  localized  maximum  of  the  neutron  emission  is 

observed.  The  plasma  motion  in  the  axial  direction  and  redistribution  of  its  parameters  along  the  radius  is 

accompanied by excitation of oscillations inside the hot part of the plasma column. This is clearly detected by 

neutron and some other local diagnostics. 

 

Dependence of Plasma Parameters on Density 

Dependence of a "diamagnetic" plasma pressure on the initial deuterium density is shown in Fig.5 for two 
distances  from  the  input  mirror.  The  time  moment  of  10 m s  after  the  beginning  of  the  beam  injection 

characterizes  the  plasma  pressure  after  completion  of  the  fast  heating  of  electrons  and  ions.  The  beam  ends 
2‚ 3 m s earlier and part of suprathermal electrons leaves the trap to this time. At the device entrance, the depend-

ence is strong but in the central section of the trap the plasma pressure is practically independent on density up to 
~2(cid:215) 1021 m-3.  After  that,  it  drops  slowly.  Wall  calorimeter  data  shows  that  in  the  high-T  regime,  the  transverse 

losses  (mainly  for  radiation)  remain  to  be  lower  than  longitudinal  ones.  At  the  high-n  regime  the  fraction  of 

transverse losses increases and moreover, the losses to limiters become probable.  

 

Currents in GOL-3 Plasma 

An important feature of GOL-3 facility is that it has two external sources of axial current. 

The first one is the plasma source, which creates preliminary (target) low-temperature plasma. 

by a linear discharge through the entire solenoid length. The second is the U-2 generator of 

the  relativistic  electron  beam,  which  injects  the  beam  into  the  preliminary  plasma.  The  net 
plasma  current  is  almost  unchanged  during  the  beam

injection, it means that the return current, which is opposite 

to  the  beam  current,  is  generated  in  the  plasma.  The 
discharge  current  achieves  7  kA  at  low  density  and 
decreases to ~1 kA at high density. As shown earlier (see, 
e.g.,  [6]),  when  the  discharge  current  falls  below  some 
threshold value, compensation of the beam current becomes 
worse, full current exceeds the Kruskal-Shafranov limit and 
the  plasma  becomes 
through 
the  beam  propagation 
unstable. 

The  current  density  on  the  axis  is  almost  equal  to  the 

averaged beam current density and it is co-directed with the

beam current) with the current on the axis (which is co-directed) shows that there is a surface

goes to infinity at this surface (here L and r are the plasma length and radius, Bz and Bf  are the 
components of the magnetic field).  
 
Direct Measurement of q Profile 

A new specialised diagnostic was developed for direct measurement of the helicity of the 

field  lines  during  the  beam  injection  period.  For  this  purpose  a  fast-frame  pinhole  detector 
imaged  the  X-ray  footprint  of  the  beam  on  the  exit  collector.  The  narrow  graphite  bar  was 

placed  into  the  beam  cross-section  near  the  far  end  of  the  plasma  source.  This  bar  partly 
blocks the electron beam and creates an “electron shadow”. The beam electrons, after passing 
the bar position, move essentially along the helical field lines. Rotation of the magnetic field 
was measured by the print of the beam shadow on the collector. Shear of the magnetic field, 
resulting from the partial compensation of the beam current, is observed.  

The  measured  dependence  q(r)  is  shown  in  Fig.6.  We  notice  a  large  paraxial  zone  with 

q<1, i.e., unstable with respect to the m=1 mode. Possible indications of such instability are 

the  X-ray  images  made  with  larger  delays  from  the  beam  start,  some  of  which  have  much 
wider (or even absent) beam shadow. Such events mean that during the frame duration of 1 m s 
a global reorganization of the magnetic structure occurs at least within the beam cross-section. 
The graphite bar partly blocks the current, so that the paraxial m

 value is a floor estimate. 

 

Influence of q Profile on Heating 

Stabilisation by shear is an important factor, which affects the plasma confinement. The 
discharge current oscillates and we can change delay between the discharge and the beam. A 

special experiment with different delays was performed (all other parameters were fixed). Fast 

full ionisation occurs after the beam start. This makes initial conditions identical except for

different amplitudes of the plasma current. Typical waveforms are shown in Fig.7. Delay of 
45  m s  is  the  main  one  for  GOL-3  facility  because  it 
provides  stable  operation  in  a  widest  density  interval. 
Changing delay of the beam start, we can perform shots 
with the discharge current co- or counter-directed to the 
beam  current,  or  with  the  discharge  already  completed. 
The  degree  of  decompensation  depends  on  the  delay.

Typical diamagnetic signals for Z=4.75 m are shown in Fig.8. Some conclusions from this 

series of shots are: 

1)  Change of the net current depends on the delay (this gives initial and final q profiles). 
2)  Peak plasma pressure and period of pressure growth depend on the delay.  
3)  At the first few meters of the plasma (region with highest beam-plasma interaction) there 

is an optimum delay time.  

4)  At farther sections of the plasma column (e.g. as in Fig.8) the peak value of the pressure 

monotonously decreases with the increase of the delay. 

Results 2-4 are really unexpected. A possible explanation is that if a surface with Bf =0 exists 
inside  the  plasma,  then  the  structure  of  turbulence  changes  and  the  level  of  turbulence 

somehow  affects  the  beam-plasma  interaction.  The  experiment  performed  shows  that  the 
radial structure of currents is really a factor, which determines the plasma confinement also. 
Discussion 

Unlike most open traps, GOL-3 uses longitudinal beam current for heating purposes. As a 
result, its magnetic field has helical structure with its inherent advantages and drawbacks. The 

advantage is the stabilizing influence of the magnetic shear on the interchange modes. On the 
other hand, the azimuthal magnetic field carries a significant free energy and thus can act as a

tearing  modes,  which  are  absent  in  usual  mirror 
traps but are common in tokamaks. 

Indeed,  in  some  ways  the  field  structure  and 
stability properties of GOL-3 are similar to those in 

tokamaks.  Most  notable  similarities  are  1)  quasi-

symmetry  (which  is  poloidal  rather  than  toroidal, 
though). Meanwhile, the differences can be listed as 

1) the absence of true periodicity, “openness” of the 
trap, 2) the role of poloidal field modulation is taken 
by  multi-mirror  modulation,  which

later.  

2) During the heating phase the effective electrons collision frequency increases by a factor of 
~103  due  to  turbulence  [4].  Though  this  period  lasts  just  5-10  m s,  the  poloidal  magnetic 
field  of  the  beam  penetrates  the  plasma  column,  so  that  the  on-axis  value  of  the  safety 
factor q reverses its sign (as compared to the preliminary discharge) and falls below unity.  

3)  Direct  measurements  show  q(0)~0.5  during  the  beam  phase.  Indeed,  one  would  expect 
development of the m=1 internal tearing mode (sawtooth) when q(0) falls below unity.  

The boundary conditions for the tearing mode in our case are not periodic, which changes 
the threshold to ~0.8. Kadomtsev's estimate for the reconnection time gets a time-scale which 

is  shorter  than  the  beam-injection  phase.  Thus,  though  such  sawteeth  cannot  be  at  present 
clearly  distinguished,  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  reconnection  events  developing  during  the 
beam phase in the core of the discharge.  

Observed role of the magnetic shear is extremely important. If we consider a multimirror 
trap as a reactor, then the magnetic shear can provide stability at b <1. Existing theory (see, 
e.g., [2,8-9]) does not cover all aspects of the only one existing multimirror experiment, GOL-
3, with large longitudinal currents. Therefore, the theory considers only plasma with b >1 to 
be stable (so-called “wall confinement”) with heavy doubts on the possibility of achievement 
of  such  regime  and  safe  transition  through  the  unstable  b <1  region.  Stabilizing  role  of  the 
magnetic  shear  enables  us  to  propose  GOL-3-like  systems  for  studies  of  plasma  with 
advanced sub-reactor parameters. 

Conclusions 

Main results of this work are the following: 

 

1. Conditions for effective plasma heating in the range (0.2‚ 6)(cid:215) 1021 m-3 are experimentally found. Electron and 

ion plasma temperatures up to 2 keV at density ~1021 m-3 are achieved. 

2. Direct measurements of q profile were done. Radial profile of the return current was shown 

to differ from that of the beam current, i.e. there is no full compensation by current density.  
3.  Radial  structure  of currents results in a sheared magnetic field, which can stabilize some 
MHD modes in the multimirror trap. In the paraxial area q < 1 during the beam injection, 
this area is unstable with respect to the internal m=1 tearing mode. 

4. Experiments with varying delay of the beam injection show that heating and confinement 

of plasma in GOL-3 substantially depend on the q profile.

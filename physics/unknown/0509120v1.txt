1. Introduction  

 

 

 

In this paper, the role of air humidity on the iron corrosion under irradiation is studied in the 

context of geological disposal of nuclear wastes. The irradiation experiments are performed at 

room  temperature  using  a  3  MeV  extracted  proton  beam  with  a  10  nA  intensity.  Different 

atmospheres are studied: Humid air with a relative humidity (RH) fixed at 45 %, dry air and a 

15N2 atmosphere (45% RH). The hydrogen and oxygen distribution profiles at the iron surface 

in  contact  with  atmosphere  are  measured  by  using  respectively  ERDA  (Elastic  Recoil 

Detection Analysis) and RBS (Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry) analysis. From these 

experiments it is clearly demonstrated that the coupling of O2+H2O enhances iron oxidation 

whereas  for  iron  hydrogenation,  humidity  is  sufficient  whatever  the  atmosphere.  An 

interpretation is given, which is based on the reaction mechanisms and the species formed by 

In  this  paper,  the  role  of  atmosphere  humidity  on  the  iron  corrosion  under  irradiation  is 

studied in the context of geological disposal of high level nuclear wastes. Indeed, in France it 

is  proposed  that  these  wastes  will  be  embedded  in  stainless  steel  containers  surrounded  by 

1

carbon  steel  overpacks.  In  a  first  step,  the  overpacks  will  be  submitted  to  atmospheric 

corrosion  under  g   irradiation.  We  propose  a  fundamental  study  of  the  iron  corrosion  under 

proton  irradiation  focussed  on  the  role  of  the  surrounding  atmosphere.  The  irradiation  are 

performed  with  a  3  MeV  proton  beam  characterised  mainly  by  electronic  interactions.  The 

resulting ionisations are similar to those created by g  irradiations , but much more intense and 

concentrated  around  the  protons  tracks.  Three  types  of  controlled  atmosphere  have  been 

successively  fixed  :  humid  air  with  a  Relative  Humidity  (RH)  of  45%,  humid  nitrogen 

atmosphere  (RH=45%)  and  dry  air.  The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  understand  the  mechanisms 

responsible  for  the  oxygen  and  hydrogen  gains  at  the  iron  surface.  Ion  beam  analysis 

techniques  are  used  to  characterise  the  evolution  of  light  elements  (H,  O,  N)  at  the  iron  – 

atmosphere interface. 

2. Experimental 

2.1 Irradiation conditions 

The irradiation experiments are performed using the 4 MV Van de Graaff accelerator of the 

Nuclear Physics Institute of Lyon (IPNL) which delivers a 3 MeV proton beam. The proton 

beam  is  extracted  from  the  beam  line  vacuum  to  the  atmosphere  by  crossing  a  5  µm  thick 

havar window. The external proton beam already described in [1], enters the irradiation cell 

through the studied iron foil and stops in water after a 100 µm range. The irradiation line is 

equipped  with  a  sweeping  system  which  allows  a  homogeneous  irradiation  over  the  whole 

iron surface (5x5 mm). During irradiation, the beam intensity was kept constant and measured 

carefully with a calibrated beam chopper. In the experiments presented in this paper, the beam 

intensity is set to 10 nA .The experimental set up is displayed in Fig. 1. The studied material 

is a 10 µm thick iron foil (99.85% purity). This foil could not be polished because its weak 

thickness. As a consequence, the iron surface presents a slight oxide contamination due to the 

2

 

 

iron  foil  manufacturing.  In  the  following,  it  will  be  referred  to  as  the  initial  sample.  The 

relative atmosphere humidity in the 8 mm thick gap between the havar window and the iron 

foil is chosen and measured. The relative humidity control set up is presented in figure 2. The 

dry gas supply is provided from a bottle whose flow is regulated with a manometer. The dry 

gas goes first through a water container, and then through an alumina (Al2O3) trap. The gas 

flow and the alumina surface in contact with the gas are adjusted in order to reach the right 

RH  equilibrium.  Throughout  the  irradiation  experiment  the  relative  humidity  is  measured 

using a Hygropalm humidity controller. 

The irradiations have been systematically performed at room temperature during 45 minutes. 

so that only the atmospheric media varies from an irradiation to another. It must be noted that 

the nitrogen gas was 99%  15N and that, in case of irradiation in dry atmosphere, the dry gas 

flow was introduced directly in the gap. 

2.2 Ion beam analysis. 

 

 

 

Ion beam analysis is performed using the 4 MV Van de Graaff accelerator of the IPNL. RBS 

and ERDA analysis are used to determine the oxygen and hydrogen profile distributions at the 

iron  surface.  RBS  is  performed  at  a  172°  detection  angle  and  with  1.7  MeV  a

  particles. 

ERDA  is  also  induced  by  1.7  MeV  a

  particles.  The incident angle on the target is 15°, the 

detection angle is 30°. A 6.5 µm thick mylar absorber is placed in front of the Si detector to 

stop backscattered a

  particles. In such conditions, the depth resolution is close to 20 nm in 

iron.  A  silicium  carbide  hydrogenated  (25  at.  %  H)  sample  was  used  as  a  normalisation 

standard. Figure 3 displays the evolution in RBS and ERDA spectra between an initial iron 

sample  and  a  corroded  one.  The  SIMNRA  program  is  used  to  simulate  the  energy  spectra 

obtained  both  by  RBS  and  ERDA  so  as  to  determine  the  atomic  concentration  profiles  of 

oxygen and hydrogen. For a given sample analysed by RBS and ERDA, the analysis is done 

3

by  iteration,  taking  always  into  account,  in  the  simulations  files,  the  iron,  oxygen  and 

hydrogen  concentrations.  Finally,  the  15N(p,a

)12C  nuclear  reaction  at  897  keV  is  used  to 

check  that  even  in  a  99%  15N  atmosphere,  the  nitrogen  concentration  at  the  iron  surface  is 

extremely  low  (figure  4).  It  demonstrates  that  nitrogen  does  not  play  any  role  on  the  iron 

corrosion.  

3. Study of the iron corrosion as a function of the atmospheric conditions 

Oxygen and hydrogen profiles are respectively presented in figures 5 and 6 as a function of 

the  surrounding  medium  during  irradiation.  Let  us  just  mention  that  the  hydrogen 

contamination  due  to  proton  irradiation  is  negligible,  more  especially  as  the  proton  beam 

crosses the iron foil. 

Concerning  the  oxygen  profiles,  figure  5  clearly  displays  that  the  oxidation  is  strongly 

enhanced up to 60 at.% only for the humid air atmosphere. In the other conditions, the oxygen 

amount  remains  the  same  as  for  the  initial  sample.  Hoerlé  et  al.  [2]  who  have  studied  iron 

atmospheric corrosion at room temperature have put in evidence the major corrosion during 

wet cycles in comparison to the dry ones. They explain such a corrosion process by oxydo-

reduction reactions: 

2 Fe ﬁ

 2 Fe2+ + 4 e- 

 

O2 + 4 e- + 2 H2O ﬁ

 4 OH- 

 

2 Fe + O2 + 2 H2O «

 2 Fe2+ + 4 OH- 

These reactions put forward the simultaneous need of O2 and H2O. In addition, Graedel et al. 

[3]  have  measured  a  corrosion  rate  in  carbon  steel  submitted  to  air  corrosion  equal  to  104 

µm.yr-1 (55 times lower than our results obtained for iron) . The electron creation induced by 

4

 

 

 

 

g
irradiation  facilitates  the  surface  reactions  and  consequently  the  oxidation  process.  This 

phenomenon is also observed for example in catalytic reactions under UV exposure [4]. 

Figures  6  shows  that  the  hydrogen  enrichment  close  to 10 at.% observed for humid air and 

humid  nitrogen  atmosphere  irradiations,  is  thus  related  to  the  presence  of  H2O  content 

atmosphere.  Wayne-Siek  et  al.  [5]  who  measured  the  charged  species  created  in  an  anoxic 

atmosphere under irradiation, have shown that more than 88% of these species are H+(H2O)n 

clusters.  It  can  be  assumed  that  these  clusters  decompose  at  the  iron  surface  allowing  the 

hydrogen penetration which could explain the previous results.  

It  has  been  shown  that  under  proton  irradiation,  the  iron  oxidation  process  requires  the 

coupled  action  of  O2  and  H2O  in  atmospheric  media.  In  contrast,  the  hydrogen  surface 

enrichment  which  can  reach  10  at.  %  occurs  without  the  presence  of  oxygen  in  humid 

The authors would like to thank Alain Chevarier and Noëlle Chevarier for their very helpful 

contribution in the frame of fruitful discussions.

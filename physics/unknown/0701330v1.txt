Abstract: I investigate a repulsive central universal force field on the behavior of 
celestial objects. I show its negative tidal effect on the solar orbits as experienced by 
Pioneer spacecrafts. I explain several cosmological effects in light of this force. 
 
Keywords: Celestial mechanics; Dark matter; Pioneer anomaly; Simple harmonic 
motion. 
 
1. Introduction 
 

Attempts to employ Newtonian mechanics to explain various cosmological 
anomalies such as Pioneer anomaly have failed so far. A vector field originates from the 
center of the universe (assuming a spherical universe), possibly local universe, could 
solve many cosmological problems. This vector field could be the work of a constant 
repulsive force that could be the one responsible for the initiation of the Big Bang event 
and situated at the center of the universe or it could be the result of an existing mass-
repulsive entity distributed throughout the cosmos (suggested candidate is anti-mass).  
The result of this field will be acceleration in the radial direction which presents a strong 
candidate to “Dark Energy”. Previous modeling of repulsive-mass-antimass universe  
[1-3] failed to explain much of cosmic behavior. In this paper I present a model of the 
universe with equal amounts of mass and antimass repelling each other, reserving a 
universal radial gravitational field.  Our Milky Way galaxy and the galactic components 
including the solar system will feel the radial acceleration. A negative-tidal force 
resulting from a component of the repulsive central force acting on the solar system will 
result in a sunward acceleration felt by the sun orbiters.  I will explain several of the 
cosmological anomalies mainly by considering the action of the central force. I will 
demonstrate that the success of Newtonian mechanics in situations like our solar system 
can be extended beyond the local system to explain the rotation speed of stars in galaxies 
(galactic rotation curves) using the proposed universal force based on the assumption that 
Newtonian gravity is a good approximation without the need for a large amount of dark 
matter to be present.  
 
2. Effect of a repulsive universal force on galactic and solar system dynamics 
 

Consider a situation where the orbit of the planet is in the radial direction of the 
universe  so  the  planet  would  be  between  the  center  of  the  universe  and  the  sun  at  one 
point and in the opposite side after half orbital period.  The proposed universal repulsive 
force will  have  a  negative  tidal effect on the solar  system and   can cause inward bulge 
(toward the sun) of the planet’s orbit as acceleration of the sun in the upward direction is 
larger  than  that  of  the  planet  when  the  planet  is  situated  above  the  sun  relative  to  the 
center  of  the  universe  while  the acceleration  of  the  planet  is  larger  than  that  of  the  sun

when  the  orbital  plane  is  not  at  900  with  the  radial  direction).  Fig.  1  shows  the  force 
acting on a celestial system with a plane perpendicular to the universal radial direction.

universal radial direction (not to scale).  

 
 
The repulsive force also affects the dynamics of galaxies. The unequal forces of 
b1 and b2 in an orbital plane that is not perpendicular to the universal radial direction as 
might  be  the  case  of  the  Milky  Way  galaxy  will  impart  unequal  accelerations  and  an 
eventual perpendicular orbital orientation (tangential to a spherical shell concentric with 
the  center  of  the  universe).  This  produces  an  oscillation  of  the  galactic  plane  about  the 
tangential  plane  because  the  produced  net  torque  will  reverse  in  each  side  when  the 
galactic  plane  overshoots  the  tangential  plane  and  eventually  alignment  of  the  galactic 
plane  with  the  tangential  plane  will  occur  at  some  point.  This  will  be  pronounced  with 
each individual star as its orbital plane oscillates about the tangential plane.

While the perpendicular components of the repulsive forces (b-forces in fig. 1) 
initiate the oscillation, the in-plane forces (a-forces in fig. 1) act as the restoring forces. 
Celestial systems will be oscillators oriented at random relative to each other due to the 
universal repulsive force acting on them. 
 

 The sun-orbiting objects, as in the case of the Pioneer spacecraft, feel negative 

tidal forces in all directions due to their orbital plane tilting relative to the tangential 
plane with varying magnitudes toward the orbited object as opposed to that of the normal 
positive tidal effect as in the case of the moon and the earth.

registered by Pioneer spacecrafts [4, 5]. Attempts to explain 

a
this anomaly have failed so far.  
 
Following the previous argument in section 2 we can explain the Pioneer Effect, which 
could be due to an external origin such as the action of the universal repulsive force 
acting on the Pioneer spacecrafts to produce negative tidal acceleration, which resulted in 
a constant sunward acceleration.  
 
4. Modeling the sun’s dynamics as simple harmonic motion 
 

The sun oscillation about the galactic plane can be treated as a simple harmonic 
motion modeled by a simple pendulum that extends from the center of the galaxy to the 
sun  with  the  sun  acting  as  the  bob  and  a  component  of  the  repulsive  central  universal 
force as the restoring force.  Using the period of the simple pendulum as the oscillation 
period of the sun to compute the gravitational field strength at the sun location when the 

galactic  plane  is  perpendicular  to  the  universal  radial  direction,

distance of the sun from the galaxy center is about 27700 ly and the oscillation period is 
about  66  M  years  about  the  galactic  plane,  g  (The  gravitational  field  strength  in  the 
immediate neighborhood of the sun, which originates from the repulsive force) is about 
24.0

Models of gravitational force law perpendicular to the galactic plane allowed the 

determination of the galactic velocity-distance relation with close fit to the velocity-
distance observations. The velocity-distance obtained from the simple harmonic 
modeling of the sun conforms to observation.

Galactic warp could be explained as well in terms of the central repulsive force of 
the  universe.  The  warp  of  galaxies  is  normally  explained  in  the  literature  in  terms  of 
contained  dark  matter.  In  this  paper  dark  matter  is  explained  in  terms  of  the  central 
repulsive  force  so  is  the  galactic  warp.  Fig.  3  shows  the  repulsive  force  acting  on  a 
proposed galaxy. If the galactic plane is not tangential to a spherical shell with its center 
as that of the universe, the central repulsive force will act with different magnitudes of 
perpendicular force components along the galaxy. The longest arm of force will provide 
the smallest component while the shortest will provide the largest component. Since the 
whole galaxy is accelerated in the radial direction due to the central repulsive force but 
one end of the galaxy is accelerated faster than the opposite one, with perpendicular force 
distribution as shown in Fig. 3, this will produce a warp of the galaxy.

7.  Effect of repulsive force on Milky Way Galaxy at the sun vicinity (dark matter 
halo) 
 

Rotation curve of our galaxy shows that the sun is moving about 60 km/s faster 

than what is contributed by visible matter as the actual sun’s velocity measures 220 km/s 
while that contributed by visible matter is about 160 km/s. The centripetal acceleration of 
a negative tidal force component on the sun possibly contributed by the proposed central 
negative force can account for the difference. Centripetal acceleration of 
24.0

sm (computed from the pendulum model) will account for the difference;

 V is close to 60 km s-1. This is usually interpreted as a 

dark matter halo.  
 
8. Dark matter distribution 
 

It is becoming known to astronomers that the distribution of galaxies follows the 
distribution of dark matter. It is easy to infer that the distribution of dark matter follows 
the  distribution  of  baryonic  matter  by  considering  an  external  gravitational  field  as  the 
cause  of  baryonic  material  behavior  as  discussed  above  to  produce  larger  orbital 
velocities  of  galactic  components.  This  is interpreted  by  astronomers  as  the  work  of  an 
existing dark matter in the cosmos which will only exist where baryonic matter exists. 
 
9. Halo density of dwarf galaxies 
 

 

6

It is known that smaller galaxies are much more dominated by dark matter. As an 

example, our Milky Way is a large galaxy with about 50% dark matter. Galaxies with 
1/100 of the luminosity of the Milky Way are about 90% dark. The smallest dwarfs 
known are almost completely made of dark matter. This can be explained by the fact that 
dark halo is independent of the galaxy size but galactic baryonic mass density is, as dark 
halo is only dependent on the repulsive gravitational field component. The smaller the 
galaxy is the less baryonic density it contains. Therefore, for smaller galaxies, dark halo 
density to baryonic density ratio will be larger.   
 
10. Modeling a repulsive mass-antimass universe 
 

The  universe  can  be  modeled  as  one  made  with  equal  amounts  of  mass  and 
antimass  and  of  consecutive  matter  and  antimatter  spherical  shells  with  the  outermost 
made from one kind considering that the repelling entity is the antimass and that antimass 
is attractive to itself. The mechanism of acceleration of the universe arises from the fact 
that  matter  (antimatter)  of  the  outermost  shell  of  the  universe  will  feel  a  net  repulsive 
force  due  to  existence  of  net  opposite  mass  bounded  by  the  shell.  This  results  in 
acceleration of the outer shell in the outward direction. The next inner shell (the second 
shell) faces the same scenario but accelerates at a lesser amount due to the existence of a 
lesser repulsive force at the proper shell parameters (mass/radius ratio). An observer in a 
galaxy in the second outermost shell will see galaxies in the outermost shell as well as 
galaxies in the next inner shell accelerate away from him.  
 

Since the shells of the universe accelerate in the radial direction, galaxies will see 
accelerations of neighboring same shell galaxies in the shell own curved plane as well as 
all  other  possible  directions  with  relative  magnitudes.  This  accelerated  movement  of 
galaxies  away  from  apposite  kind  of  galaxies  leaves  voids  [7]  among  them  which 
accounts for the overall sponge-like structure of the universe. This is the same any where 
in the universe due to its spherical symmetry. The accelerated movement of galaxies in 
the  context  of  the  universal  repulsive  force  presents  a  good  strong  candidate  to  “Dark 
Energy”. 
 

Analysis of the velocity of a star near the edge of a galaxy that resides in the inner 

edge of the outer most shell is as follows:  
 

Suppose that the last shell carries antimass and assuming a symmetrical universe, 
this shell will then enclose a net normal mass with same magnitude. We can now apply 
Gauss’s law to account for the gravitational field that pushes away the galaxy, of galactic 
plane inclination angle θ relative to the universal radial direction in the radial direction. 
The  governing  equation  will  be ∫
;  where  menclosed  is  the  enclosed  net 
Gm
normal  mass.  If  we  restrict  the  halo  within  the  volume  of  the  galaxy  only,  rotational 
velocity of the star located near the outer edge of the galaxy will be approximated by

tidal  force  acting  on  the  star  due  to  the  existence  of  the  universal  repulsive  force  as 
explained earlier.  
 
11. Rotation curves 
 

Rotation curves of galaxies (RCs) precisely describe the dynamics of galaxies [8]. 
RCs are also used to discuss dark matter distribution in halos [9]. It is well known that 
rotation  curves  of  spiral  galaxies  are  flat.  This  is  usually  attributed  to  the  existence  of 
halos  surrounding  galaxies  that  contain  unseen  dark  matter,  which  should  in  theory 
constitute the missing mass.  
                                                                          

Fig. 4 shows an illustration of the acting force lines on a star with their relative 

angles.

12. Conclusion 
  

I  have  shown  that  by  accounting  for  the  negative  (repulsive)  component  in 
Newtonian  mechanics  we  can  provide  a  reasonable  explanation  to  several  cosmic 
anomalies  such  as  dark  matter,  dark  energy,  rotation  curves,  Pioneer  anomaly  and 
galactic warp.

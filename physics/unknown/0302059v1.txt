Abstract
—The Dicke superradiance on vibronic transitions of impurity crystals is considered. It is shown that
parameters of the superradiance (duration and intensity of the superradiance pulse and delay times) on each
vibronic transition depend on the strength of coupling of electronic states with the intramolecular impurity
vibration (responsible for the vibronic structure of the optical spectrum in the form of vibrational replicas of
the pure electronic line) and on the crystal temperature through the Debye–Waller factor of the lattice vibra-
tions. Theoretical estimates of the ratios of the time delays, as well as of the superradiance pulse intensities for
different vibronic transitions well agree with the results of experimental observations of two-color superradi-
ance in the polar dielectric 
. In addition, the theory describes qualitatively correctly the critical temper-
ature dependence of the superradiance effect.

INTRODUCTION

N

A  system  of  two-level  particles,  transferred,  ini-
tially, into an excited state, due to interaction with vac-
uum  oscillations  of  the  radiation  ﬁeld,  drops  to  the
ground state with emission of an electromagnetic pulse.
If the dephasing is inefﬁcient, the dipole moments of
individual  particles,  in  the  process  of  spontaneous
emission, become correlated, i.e., a macroscopic polar-
ization arises in the system, which is proportional to the
. As a result, the intensity
number of inverted particles 
, with
of the emitted pulse appears to be quadratic in 
its duration being inversely proportional to 
. This kind
of decay of the inverted system is referred to as sponta-
neous coherent emission or merely superradiance. This
phenomenon was ﬁrst predicted by Dicke [1] (for the
history  of  the  problem  and  references  see  [2–5]).
Superradiance differs from steady-state laser emission
and from the ampliﬁed spontaneous emission proceed-
ing  within  the  time  intervals  comparable  with  the
dephasing time in that the emission intensity, in the two
latter  processes,  is  proportional  to  the  density  of  the
inverted particles.

Experimentally, 

the  superradiance  was  mostly
observed in gases [6], though in a less pure form it was
also  detected  in  impurity  crystals,  namely,  in  polar
dielectrics  [7,  8]  and  aromatic  compounds  [3,  9–14].
These  experiments,  as  well  as  the  implementation  of
laser  action  in  the  region  of  the  phonon  wing  of  the
optical spectra of crystals (see, e.g., special issues on
solid-state lasers [15, 16]), indicate the key role of elec-
tron–phonon coupling in the formation of the coherent
states of the ﬁeld and matter. It is important that emis-
sion of an ensemble of optical impurities in crystal is
usually regarded as a pure electronic transition between
the  excited  and  ground  states.  In  this  approach,  the
effect of the lattice or intramolecular vibrations on the

impurity  particle  is  weak  and  is  mainly  reduced  to  a
shift and broadening of the spectral line of the optical
transition. However, for sufﬁciently strong interaction
of the optical centers with the lattice and intramolecular
vibrations,  the  elementary  events  of  absorption  and
emission of the light quanta are accompanied by cre-
ation  and  annihilation  of  vibrational  quanta,  which
gives  rise  to  formation  of  the  electronic–vibrational
(vibronic)  structure  of  the  optical  spectra  and,  thus,
complicates the processes of formation of both the laser
emission and superradiance. Therefore, the phenomena
under  consideration  should  acquire  a  number  of  fea-
tures not inherent in the usual situation when the effect
of the environment on the electronic transition is weak.
In particular, the emission of the superradiance pulses
and laser emission may become possible on vibronic,
rather  than  only  on  zero-phonon,  transitions  (on  the
phonon sideband), with the characteristic parameters of
the phenomena being dependent on the strength of the
electron–phonon coupling and on the crystal tempera-
ture.  The  problem  of  taking  into  account  the  strong
electron–phonon  coupling  for  laser  action  in  a  solid-
state gain medium was ﬁrst discussed by McCumber in
[17].  Within  the  framework  of  a  phenomenological
approach  based  on  the  principle  of  detailed  balance
(which  expresses  in  a  generalized  form  the  relation
 coefﬁcients) McCumber
between the Einstein 
has calculated the gain factor for the vibronic laser as a
function  of  the  light  frequency,  populations  of  elec-
tronic  levels,  and  crystal  lattice  temperature.  In  these
calculations,  the  microscopic  nature  and  form  of  the
electron–phonon coupling were not taken into account.
Only a few papers are available where the role of the
strong  electron–phonon  coupling,  upon  formation  of
laser emission and superradiance is analyzed from the
microscopic point of view (see, e.g., [3, 9–14, 18–29]).

The  development  of  the  microscopic  theory  of
superradiance and laser emission in a resonance crystal
medium  with  appropriate  allowance  for  the  strength
and form of electron–phonon coupling, as well as spe-
ciﬁc features of the vibrational spectrum and tempera-
ture  of  the  crystal  lattice,  is  important  not  only  for
understanding  of  the  physical  processes  and  correct
interpretation  of  experimental  data,  but  also  for  the
elaboration  of  principles  of  optimal  selection  of  the
materials in which the above phenomena may be imple-
mented.

The superradiance in impurity crystals was analyzed
from the microscopic point of view in [3, 9–14] for the
case of weak coupling between emitters and phonons
and in [18–21] for the case of strong coupling. Speciﬁc
features of the superradiance within the framework of
Thompson’s model [22], which describes the processes
of Brillouin scattering in resonance media with emis-
sion or absorption of a single phonon, were considered
in [24, 25]. A phenomenological approach with the use
of  three-  and  four-level  energy  diagrams  of  optical
impurities in crystals was developed in [26, 27].

In  what  follows,  we  propose  a  consistent  micro-
scopic theory of the vibronic superradiance oriented to
a real experimental situation of observation of this phe-
nomenon on vibronic transitions of the 
 molecules in
the polar dielectrics 

 [7, 8].

FORMULATION  OF  THE  MODEL

–
O2

KCl:

In  the 

  system,  the  electronic  transition  is
strongly coupled to one of the high-frequency intramo-
lecular vibrations and much more weakly to other lat-
tice  vibrations.  The  frequency  of  the  intramolecular
mode exceeds several times the limiting frequencies of
the lattice modes. According to the general theory [30–
32], the luminescence (or optical absorption) spectrum
should consist, in this case, of a series of narrow well-
resolved  lines  representing  replicas  of  the  pure  elec-
tronic  line  related  to  intramolecular  vibrations.  Each
line of the series should be accompanied by the phonon
wing,  arising  due  to  excitation  of  crystal  vibrations
together with the intramolecular ones.

For  the  density  matrix 

  of  the  impurity  system
interacting  with  the  electromagnetic  ﬁeld,  we  may

ELIMINATION  OF  THE  FAST VARIABLES
In  the  problem  of  superradiance,  the  polarization
±
(~
R j
)  of  optical  impurities  are
slow  variables,  whereas  the  variables  of  the  radiation
ﬁeld, as well as those of the local vibrations and lattice
modes, are fast variables. Therefore, the last-mentioned

)  and  inversion  (~

z
R j

may be adiabatically separated using general methods
of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics [37] and, thus,
the master equation for the density matrix of the ensem-
ble of impurities may be obtained. The sought equation
of the second order in the interaction Haf (or Laf) may be
represented  in  the  form  of  a  differential  (rather  than
integro-differential, as is commonly done) equation, by
using the method developed in [38]:

It  is  worthwhile  to  make  a  few  remarks  about  the
form  of  function  (22).  First,  we  will  assume  that  the
interaction of the light with the optical center occurs in
such  a  way  that  the  number  of  the  lattice  phonons
before and after the interaction is the same (elastic pro-
cess), i.e., only one term with p = 0 should be retained
in the sum over p. Second, to be able to study the pro-
cesses of spontaneous emission with the participation
of a speciﬁed number of created and annihilated quanta
of the local vibration, we may use, in Eq. (22), the res-
onance approximation by removing summation over r
and s. Then, the function

determines  the  contribution  to  emission  of  the  light
quantum  with  the  frequency  ω  =  ε  –  ν(r  –  s)  on  the
vibronic transition from the sth vibrational level in the
excited  electronic  state  (s  vibrational  quanta  with  the
frequency ν are annihilated) to the rth vibrational level
of the ground electronic state (r vibrational quanta of
the same frequency ν are created) with an unchanged
vibrational state of the host lattice. Therefore, the mas-
ter  equation  for  the  density  matrix,  describing  the
  gr  vibronic  transition  (where  e  and  g  are  the
es 
excited  and  ground  electronic  states)  for  unchanged
occupation  numbers  of  the  lattice  modes,  as  follows
from Eq. (20), should be represented in the form

TWO-COLOR  SUPERRADIANCE. 
COMPARISON WITH  THE  EXPERIMENT
In  the  experiments  [7,  8],  the  2Π

u  electronic
 in KCl was excited
transition of the molecular ions 
by  30-ps  pulses  at  the  wavelength  266  nm.  For  the
pump power density exceeding 20 GW/cm2 and at low
temperatures  (T  <  30  K),  a  two-color  (yellow–red)
coherent emission on the vibronic transitions 0–10 and
0–11 (with the wavelengths 592.8 and 629.1 nm) was
observed. The intensity of the emission exceeded by a
factor of 104 the usual spontaneous emission. When the
pump power decreased by about a factor of two, down
to 10 GW/cm2, the yellow superradiance pulse disap-
peared  and  only  the  red  one  could  be  observed.  The
measured delay time of the pulses varied from 0.5 to
10 ns. The  spot  of  the  focused  pump  was  0.01  cm  in
diameter, and the initial inversion density, for the sam-
ple  length  l  =  1  cm,  was  estimated  to  be  n  =  N/V  =
1017 cm–3 (where the volume V was 0.01 × 0.01 × 1 =
10–4 cm3), though this value, as was pointed out in [39],
may be slightly overestimated. The homogeneous and
inhomogeneous relaxation times were T2 = 100 ps (at
T = 4.2 K) and 
 = 30 ps, respectively. The radiative
decay time was T1 = 10 ns.

First  of  all,  we  may  compare  the  theoretical  and
experimental ratios of the delay times of the yellow and
red superradiance pulses. From Eq. (30) we have

(here  we  take  into  account  that,  for 
  in  KCl,  the
dimensionless  Stokes  losses  are  ξ2  =  9,  i.e.,  the  0–9
vibronic line shows the highest oscillator strength [8],
the decay time of the vibrational levels is α–1 = 50 ps
[7], and c/l = 3 × 1010 s–1). Thus, for the pump power
exceeding the threshold (20 GW/cm2), the yellow pulse
should  be  generated  ﬁrst  and  the  red  one,  second.
Indeed, it was found experimentally (see Fig. 7 in [8])
that the statistically averaged delay time of the yellow

pulse is smaller than that of the red one approximately
in  the  proportion  predicted  by  theoretical  estimates.

To estimate the temperature factor in Eqs. (35) and
(37), we approximate the phonon spectrum of KCl in
the  low-temperature  range  by  the  effective  frequency
ϖ ≈ 40 cm–1 and take the Stokes losses into the lattice
modes to be equal to 0.23 [31]. Then, for T = 4.2 K,
using Eq. (37), we obtain the initial concentration n =
1.2 × 1016 cm–3, which should enter into formula (35)
. To implement the superradiance on the 0–10
for 
vibronic transition, the initial density n of the superra-
diating  particles  (or,  which  is  the  same,  the  pump
power) should be increased by approximately 30% to
meet condition (36). In the experiments [7, 8], the tran-
sition  from  single-color  to  two-color  superradiance
required  nearly  a  twofold  enhancement  of  the  pump
power. A possible reason for this is that the theoretical
estimate does not take into account a deeper correlation
in the formation of the superradiance pulses on differ-
ent  vibronic  transitions,  since,  when  going  from  Eq.
(20) to Eq. (26), we used the “resonance” approxima-
 <

As  the  temperature  increases,  the  Debye–Waller
factor decreases faster than the zero-order Bessel func-
tion increases. According to Eqs. (35), (36), and (29),
this leads to an increase of duration and delay times for
the superradiance pulses. The increase of the superradi-
ance time, in turn, reduces the gain κl (34). Note that,
in conformity with the Beer law, a decrease in the gain
by a factor of m corresponds to a decrease in the inten-
sity by m orders of magnitude. The superradiance inten-
sity  on  the  vibronic  transitions  0–10  and  0–11  mea-
sured experimentally [7, 8] exceeded the spontaneous
background by a factor of 104. Thus it is clear that an
increase in the superradiance pulse duration, e.g., by a
factor of two, due to the increasing temperature of the
sample, should suppress nearly completely the superra-
diance  effect.  Indeed,  the  superradiance  could  be
observed only below some critical temperature which
depended on concentration of the 
 centers, namely,
for the highest achievable concentration 7 × 1017 cm–3,
this temperature was 27 K and was reduced to 8 K for
the concentration 8 × 1016 cm–3. Thus, to compensate
for the destructive effect of the thermal factor, one has,
when  increasing  the  sample  temperature,  to  increase
the  concentration  of  the  optical  centers  (or  the  pump
power),  which  also  follows  from  Eq.  (35).  Formula

superradiance  time  remains  ﬁxed,  may  be  used  to
account for (at least qualitatively) the critical tempera-
ture dependence of the superradiance effect. The curve
in the ﬁgure shows (the experimental dependence [8] is
shown in the inset of the ﬁgure) how the concentration
of  the  optical  centers  should  be  increased  with  the
increasing  temperature  of  the  sample  so  as  not  to
destroy conditions for the implementation of the super-
radiance effect.

It  is  noteworthy  that  two-color  superradiance  has
recently been observed experimentally [41] in the Van
Vleck  paramagnetic  LaF3:  Pr3+,  but  on  the  pure  elec-
tronic,  rather  than  on  vibronic,  transitions  3P0–3H4(0)
and 3P0–3H6.

CONCLUSION

The master equation for the Dicke superradiance on
vibronic transitions of impurity crystals is derived (see
also [42, 43]). The superradiance parameters (the delay
times,  durations  and  intensities  of  the  superradiance
pulses)  for  each  vibronic  transition  are  shown  to
depend on the strength of coupling between the elec-
tronic states and the intramolecular impurity mode that
produces the vibronic structure of the optical spectrum
in the form of vibrational sidebands of the pure elec-
tronic  line,  and  on  the  crystal  temperature  via  the
Debye–Waller factor of the lattice vibrations. The the-
oretical  estimates  of  the  ratio  of  the  delay  times  and
intensities  of  the  superradiance  pulses  for  different

7
vibronic  transitions  well  agree  with  the  experimental
data on observation of the two-color superradiance in
–
the  polar  dielectric  KCl:
O2
.  In  addition,  the  theory
describes  qualitatively  well  the  critical  temperature
dependence of the superradiance.

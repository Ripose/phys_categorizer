In  special  relativity,  Hestenes’  spacetime  algebra  (STA)  provides  a  powerful  and  insightful 

approach to an invariant formulation of physics – the spacetime physics – through an elegant and 

concise manipulation of active Lorentz transformations. Therefore, it should come as an oddity – 

to  say  the  least  –  to  relate  STA  with  passive  Lorentz  transformations.  Nevertheless,  length 

contraction,  time  dilation  and  all  that  are  the  bread  and  butter  of  most  introductory  courses  on 

relativistic physics. To overcome the coordinate “virus”, it is necessary to be able to translate and 

dissolve passive Lorentz transformations in the fluidity and flexibility of STA, thereby bridging 

the gap between relativistic physics and proper spacetime physics. That is the aim of this paper.

I. Introduction 

There  is  a  plethora  of  pedagogical  approaches  to  special  relativity  and  this  journal,  in 

particular, is an exceptional repository of that endeavor. It has even been argued that the 

Lorentz transformation doesn’t belong in a first exposure to special relativity.1 At some 

point, nevertheless, it is inevitable to establish the Lorentz transformation. Probably one

of  the  most  clear  and  insightful  approaches  develops  the  subject  using  Bondi’s  k  

calculus and only at a fairly late stage arrives at the Lorentz transformation.2 3 However, 

there  are  two  radically  opposite  ways  of  deriving  the  Lorentz  transformations:  either 

with4  5  6  or  without7  8  9  10  Einstein’s  second  postulate  on  the  speed  of  light.  Although 

most  introductory  courses  disregard  the  second  approach,  it  was  adopted  in  a  French 

textbook  for  undergraduate  students.11  For  the  more  mathematically  inclined  students, 

there  are  yet  other  possibilities.12  Accordingly,  a  question  arises:  Is  it  admissible  to 

present another derivation of the Lorentz transformation? 

Apart from the scientific and pedagogical problem of Lorentz transformations in general, 

there is another interesting albeit slightly different problem that is intimately related to a 

new paradigm in physics eloquently pioneered by David Hestenes:13  14  15  16 What is the 

role  of  Lorentz  transformations,  namely  the  passive  ones,  in  the  context  of  geometric 

algebra?16 17 Indeed, within the framework of spacetime algebra (STA) – the geometric 

algebra of spacetime –, it seems that Lorentz transformations are misplaced. In fact, STA 

tries  to  explain  ab  initio  that  coordinates  should  be  avoided  and,  as  Lorentz 

transformations  are  usually  expressed  in  the  form  of  a  coordinate  transformation,  they 

should be expelled from STA’s heaven. “Relativistic physics” is considered a misnomer 

as  it  should  be  transformed  into  spacetime  physics,  because  STA  provides  us  with  an 

invariant  (i.e.,  coordinate-free)  formulation  of  physical  equations.  It  is  important, 

nevertheless,  to  relate  invariant  physical  quantities  to  some  reference  frame  in  order  to 

interpret  experimental  results.  The  answer  to  this  problem  within  STA  is  usually  the 

following: The best way to relate the proper physics to an inertial observer is through a 

 

 

2

spacetime  split.16  17  However,  a  spacetime  split  is  only  possible  because  STA  is  a 

graded  algebra  where  scalars  can  be  added  with  vectors,  bivectors,  etc.  The  general 

elements  of  a  geometric  algebra  are  multivectors:  scalars  are  multivectors  of  grade-0, 

vectors grade-1, bivectors grade-2 and so on. The grade of an object is the dimension of 

the  hyperplane  it  specifies.  Therefore,  in  a  graded  algebra  we  can  project  a  general 

multivector onto the terms of a chosen grade. So, if there is the possibility of a spacetime 

split with STA, why insisting in Lorentz transformations? 

Finally, one should answer the two questions that were left answered: (1) Is it necessary 

to  present  another  derivation  of  the  Lorentz  transformation?  (2)  Is  it  necessary  to  use 

passive  Lorentz  transformations  in  STA?  In  fact,  if  one  thinks  that  STA  is  the  most 

appropriate framework for special relativity, then it is necessary to deal with such effects 

as  length  contraction,  time  dilation  or  the  twin  “paradox”.  These  effects  can  only  be 

systematically studied through the comparison of different observers for the same event, 

i.e.,  through  passive  Lorentz  transformations.  It  is  always  possible  to  develop  a  hybrid 

system  where  passive  Lorentz  transformations  are  derived  outside  STA  and  then  using 

these  transformations  in  conjunction  with  STA.18  However,  in  this  paper  another 

possibility is pursued: to derive passive Lorentz transformations using the tools of STA, 

thereby  bridging  the  gap  between  relativistic  physics  and  proper  spacetime  physics.  In 

fact,  it  is  not  reasonable  to  defend  the  superiority  of  STA  for  an  advanced  approach  to 

special relativity and, at the same time, to derive passive Lorentz transformations outside 

the scope of STA  or  assuming them as  a given when studying STA. That is the reason 

why, in this paper, passive Lorentz transformations are derived in the context of STA. As 

 

 

3

far  as  the  author  knows,  such  a  derivation  can  only  be  found  in  Chapter  9  of  Ref.  14, 

using however an approach that doesn’t fit together with the spacetime split of Ref. 16 – 

whereas  the  approach  herein  presented  is  much  more  akin  to  the  spirit  of  STA  as 

presented both in Ref. 16 and in Chapter 5 of Ref. 17. 

As  Hestenes’  geometric  calculus  cannot  be  considered  as  part  of  mainstream 

mathematical  physics  yet,  STA  has  to  be  presented  (almost)  from  scratch  and  thus  the 

present  derivation  should  be  (reasonably)  self-contained  from  a  pedagogical  point  of 

view. Accordingly, the treatment presented in this paper can be also considered as a brief 

tutorial  of  STA,  having  in  mind  to  provide  a  more  intimate  connection  with  the 

elementary three-dimensional vector calculus that stems from the work of Josiah Willard 

Gibbs.19 To help this purpose, several exercises are spread out across the text to assist the 

neophyte in STA. 

II. Minkowski Spacetime 

Special  relativity  is  usually  derived  from  the  two  Einstein’s  postulates:  (i)  the  first 

postulate,  the  principle  of  relativity,  according  to  which  all  inertial  (non-accelerating) 

frames are equivalent for the purposes of physical experiment; (ii) the second postulate, 

that  the  speed  of  light  c   is  the  same  for  all  inertial  observers.  Here  we  adopt  the 

heterodox  viewpoint  of  Lévy-Leblond,7  according  to  which  the  second  postulate  is 

superfluous. Hence, when we write the constant  c , we do not mean a priori the speed of 

light in vacuum – it should be just an appropriate normalization constant that transforms 

units  of  time  into  units  of  length,  as  in 

c t=

.  Only  later  it  will  be  found  that  c   is, 

0x

4

 

 

 

indeed, a natural limit that arises from the composition law for velocities. The fact that 

electromagnetic waves propagate with velocity  c  in vacuum should be considered as an 

experimental observation. 

Our  starting  point  is  the  concept  of  spacetime  as  a  four-dimensional  continuum  whose 

points are called events. There is a clear distinction between a physical event, represented 

by  a  point  x   in  our  absolute  spacetime,  and  its  coordinates  xµ  (with 

µ= … )  in  a 
,3

0,

particular frame generated by four orthogonal vectors  {

e , e , e , e
0
1

2

3

}

, so that – using the 

summation  convention  –  we  have 

x

=

.  As  usual  in  the  literature,  we  use  Latin 

xµ

e
µ

indices to denote the range 1-3 and Greek indices for the full spacetime range 0-3, i.e., 

one  has 

x

µ
e
µ =

x

0

e

0

+

x

ek

k

.  The  coordinates  in 

4(cid:92)   correspond  to  the  relativistic 

viewpoint, whereas  x  belongs to proper spacetime physics. 

Our model for spacetime is a Clifford algebra – the STA characterized in the next section. 

The STA is generated by our absolute spacetime continuum (or manifold) – a Minkowski 

spacetime M , that is a vector space, where the point (or event)  x  resides. In other words, 

from the mathematical point of view, each event  x ∈M  is a vector. With vector addition 

and  scalar  multiplication  taken  for  granted,  we  impose  a  geometry  on  our  vector  space 

M , by defining the geometric product  u v  for vectors  u ,  v ,  w , with the rules:16  

(

u v w u v w

(

(
u v w

u v u w

2u ∈ (cid:92) .   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(4) 

The last rule, Eq. (4), is the contraction and is what distinguishes this STA from a general 

associative  algebra.  We  do  not  force  the  contraction  to  be  positive,  just  a  real  number. 

The  geometric  (or  Clifford)  product  uv   can  be  decomposed  into  a  symmetric  inner 

product  u v⋅

 and an antisymmetric outer product  u v∧ , as follows: 

u v

⋅ =

uv

+

vu

u v

∧ =

uv vu

.

Exercise  1.  Show  that  the  inner  product  u v⋅

  is  a  scalar  by  forming  the  square  of  the 

vector  u v+ . 

The inner product  u v⋅

 returns a scalar. The outer product, on the other hand, returns a 

bivector  u v∧   which  encodes  an  oriented  hyperplane  in  spacetime.  From  Eqs.  (5)  the 

geometric product can be defined in terms of the inner and outer products as 

u v

= ⋅ + ∧ . 
u v u v

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(6) 

Therefore,  u v

v u=

  iff 

u v∧ =   ( u   and  v   are  parallel)  and  u v

0

= −

v u

  iff 

u v⋅ =   ( u  
0

and  v  are orthogonal). The elements of STA are multivectors that can be broken up into 

terms  of  different  grade.  Multivectors  containing  terms  of  only  one  grade  are  called 

homogeneous.  The  scalar  term  is  assigned  grade-0,  the  vectors  grade-1  and  bivectors 

grade-2. We denote the projection onto terms of a chosen grade- r  by 

, so that in Eq. 

r

(6) we have 

u v

⋅ =

u v

 and 

u v

∧ =

u v

. The subscript 0 on the scalar part is usually 

0

2

suppressed, i.e., 

u v

⋅ =

u v

=

u v

. Any multivector which can be written purely as the 

0

 

 

 

 

 

6

outer product of a set of vectors is called a blade. Accordingly, any multivector can be 

expressed as a sum of blades – provided that an explicit basis is introduced.  

Exercise  2.  Prove 

that, 

for  a  bivector  B u

s

its  square 

is  given  by

There is a natural extension of the inner and outer products to general multivectors. For 

,u v w∈M , we define

The dot is used in Eq. (7) as this operation is grade-lowering, whereas the wedge is used 

in Eq. (8) since it is grade-raising. 

Exercise  3.  Using  Eqs.  (7)  and  (8),  prove  that

Therefore, the outer product is associative – whereas the cross product (of vectors defined 

in ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space) is not.

Indeed, as we are considering two frames with parallel axes moving away with velocity

One  should  stress  that  bivector  ˆB   has  different  representations  in  frames  S   and  S   as 

ˆ
B = v   in  S ,  whereas

The unusual result

 is due to the fact that STA is a Clifford algebra 

1,3C(cid:65)

 

with nondefinite metric: its signature is negative, as 

tr

µνη = − .20  

)

From Eqs. (19) and (29) it is also possible to express vectors  ˆv  and  ˆw  in the form

III. Spacetime Algebra 

In  this  section  our  graded  algebra  –  Hestenes’  STA  –  will  be  briefly  described.16  This 

Clifford  algebra  is  different  from  the  so-called  algebra  of  physical  space  (APS), 

advocated  by  William  Baylis.23  24  STA  is  a  real  algebra  in  Minkowski  spacetime, 

whereas APS is a complex algebra where every element reduces to a complex paravector 

(the  sum  of  a  scalar  and  a  vector)  while  using  a  three-dimensional  Euclidean  space.  In 

this  paper  we  adopt  Hestenes’  STA  because  it  deals  with  invariants  (proper  physics), 

whereas APS deals with covariants (relativistic physics).25  

Using a basis { }eµ , the STA is generated through the geometric product between vectors 

as stated in Eqs. (1)-(4). Then, the STA has a basis with

 elements:

by 

 

 

 

 

 

15

One should stress that  I  is not a true scalar because it anticommutes with both vectors 

and  trivectors  (it  commutes  with  bivectors  though).26  Vectors  and  trivectors  are 

interchanged by a duality transformation as, e.g.,

In this STA a generic element  M , called multivector, can be expanded as 

M

= + + +

a B I b I

α

+

β

 

 

where α and  β are scalars,  a  and  b  are vectors and  B  is a bivector. One should note 

that  not  all  homogeneous  multivectors  are  pure  blades:  bivector

In  STA  there  is  an  elegant  way  to  project  invariants  onto  different  observers:  the 

spacetime  split.  Let  us  consider  an  event  x ∈M .  From  the  perspective  of  an  observer 

characterized by the rest frame { }eµ , we obtain the spacetime split from 

x

c t

x

r

=

e

Therefore, defining a bivector

, where  R  is a rotor. Rotors form a multiplicative group called

the restricted Lorentz group. There are two types of Lorentz rotations: boosts (or timelike 

rotations)  and  spacelike  rotations  (or  rotations  for  short).  For  a  boost,  rotor  L   can  be 

factored  into  a  product  of  two  unit  timelike  vectors;  for  a  rotation,  rotor  U   can  be 

factored into a product of two unit spacelike vectors. A product of a spacelike vector with

a  timelike  vector  is  not  a  rotor  as,  e.g.,

Exercise 17 shows that, in general, a Lorentz rotation  R  is a composite of a boost  L  and 

a  rotation  U .  However,  while  rotations  form  a  subgroup  of  the  restricted  Lorentz 

transformations, boosts on the other hand do not form a group. Indeed the composite of 

two boosts is equivalent to the composite of a rotation and a single boost, as shown in the 

next exercise.

Thus  c  is the maximum and invariant value for a particle’s velocity. The existence of a 

finite  value  for

(

c =

)

.  The  fact  that  c   is  the  speed  of  light  (in  vacuum)  is  a  result  from 

electromagnetic theory and is, therefore, strictly outside the scope of special relativity. 

IV. Passive Lorentz Transformations 

In an active Lorentz transformation, for a given observer (in one inertial frame), it is the 

frame of the object being observed that changes. In a passive Lorentz transformation, on 

the contrary, for a given object under observation there are different observers and hence 

it  is  the  frame  of  the  observer  that  is  changed.  Length  contraction  and  time  dilation 

belong, in that sense, to passive Lorentz transformations. In Chapter 9 of Ref. 14, David 

Hestenes  deals  with  passive  Lorentz  transformations  using  relative  paravectors.27  Our 

20

presentation is based on the fact that, according to Eqs. (15) and (27), 

ˆ
B =

ˆ
v

e

0

=

ˆ
w  and 
0

e

hence it is directly related to the STA presented in Refs. 16 and 17. 

In  STA  what  characterizes  the  relative  motion  of  two  observers  S   and  S   is  bivector 

B

ˆ
Bβ=

  in  Eq.  (14)  for  rotor 

2L .  Any  event  x   in  our  absolute  spacetime  can  be 

projected onto bivector  ˆB . As 

2ˆ
B = , one has 

1

x

=

(

ˆ
xB B

 and hence 

x

=

=

ˆ
ˆ
x B B

,

x

ˆ

x B B

∧

. 

 

The  interesting  thing  about  this  decomposition  is  that  it  is  absolute,  i.e.,  it  does  not 

depend  on  any  particular  observer.  However,  for  a  particular  observer  characterized  by 

0e , one has 

x

=

(

c t

) 0e

+ r , with

=

ˆ
v

,

r

(

ˆ
r v

)

. 

Hence, for two different observers 

0e  and 

0e , we may write 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

x
(cid:38)

=

x
r
⊥ = −

ˆ

r
= −

r
(cid:38)

ˆ

.   

But then, as 

r
r
⊥ = −

ˆr
v(cid:38)

, one has 

⊥=r

r .   

⊥

Moreover, using Eqs. (29) and (31), one gets from Eq. (53) the transformation law

instance, the particular case

e=v

ˆ
e=w

 corresponds to 

2ϑ π=

 and 

0ϕ=  in Eqs.

To  study  such  elementary  consequences  as  time  dilation  and  length  contraction,  it  is

V. Concluding Remarks 

Classical electrodynamics is one of the most perfect examples of what a scientific theory 

should be. Apart from its intrinsic physical significance, Maxwell equations represent a 

landmark  in  physics  that  prompted  some  of  the  most  important  developments,  both  in 

mathematics and in physics, that took place ever since. Special relativity is undoubtedly a 

consequence  of  those  scientific  advances  –  although,  from  an  epistemological 

perspective, one should consider its foundations as independent from electromagnetism. 

Accordingly,  Lorentz  transformations  should  be  derived  without  Einstein’s  second 

postulate  on  the  speed  of  light.7  Nevertheless,  Maxwell  equations  written  within  the 

framework  of  special  relativity  led  Arnold  Sommerfeld  to  write:  “I  wish  to  create  the 

23

impression in my readers that the true mathematical structure of these entities will appear 

only now, as in a mountain landscape when the fog lifts.”28 

Special relativity suggested the following words from Hermann Minkowski: “Henceforth 

space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only 

a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.”29 The STA presented in 

Refs.  16  and  17  is,  from  the  author’s  viewpoint,  the  most  adequate  mathematical 

language  to  express  that  union.  The  elementary  three-dimensional  vector  analysis  – 

created  by  Gibbs  –  that,  even  nowadays,  pervades  most  undergraduate  approaches  to 

physics and engineering, suffers from a major flaw: the cross product of vectors, that only 

exists  in  three  (or  seven)  dimensions  is  not  associative;  moreover,  its  inherent  mirror 

asymmetry  creates  a  fork  in  vector  calculus  that  leads  to  a  superfluous  distinction 

between  axial  and  polar  vectors.  Only  tensors,  differential  forms,  spinors  or  Clifford 

algebras  can  deal  appropriately  with  spacetime  manifolds.  However,  STA  is  a  Clifford 

algebra  that  is  particularly  well  designed  to  describe  the  inner  geometry  of  Minkowski 

spacetime,  by  dealing  directly  with  proper  spacetime  physics,  namely  through  active 

Lorentz transformations. 

The  most  common  pedagogical  introductions  to  special  relativity  explore  Lorentz 

transformations through a passive interpretation, whereas more advanced applications are 

mainly concerned with proper physics under active Lorentz transformations. The author 

hopes  that,  with  the  pedagogical  approach  presented  in  this  paper,  a  more  smooth  and 

 

 

 

24

clear  transition  from  passive  to  active  interpretations  of  Lorentz  transformations  within 

the framework of STA becomes available.

26  One  should  note  confuse  I ,  the  unit  pseudoscalar  in  STA,  with  the  imaginary  unit 

i ∈ (cid:94)  (a true scalar) that belongs to a field – not to the STA which is a real algebra. 

27 In Ref. 14, Hestenes represents an event not by a vector, as in Ref. 16 (or herein), but 

through  a  paravector  X c t=

the  disadvantage  of  not 

leading 

straightforwardly  to  the  invariant  interval

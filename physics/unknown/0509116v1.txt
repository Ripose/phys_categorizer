Abstract 
 
This paper presents a study of the effects of proton irradiation on iron corrosion. Since it is 

known that in humid atmospheres, iron corrosion is enhanced by the double influence of air 

and humidity, we studied the iron corrosion under irradiation with a 45% relative humidity. 

Three  proton  beam  intensities  (5,  10  and  20  nA)  were  used.  To  characterise  the  corrosion 

layer,  we  used  ion  beam  methods  (Rutherford  Backscattering  Spectrometry  (RBS),  Elastic 

Recoil  Detection  Analysis  (ERDA))  and  X-ray  Diffraction  (XRD)  analysis.  The  corrosion 

kinetics are plotted for each proton flux. A diffusion model of the oxidant species is proposed, 

taking into account the fact that the flux through the surface is dependent on the kinetic factor 

K. This model provides evidence for the dependence of the diffusion coefficient, D, and the 

kinetic  factor,  K,  on  the  proton  beam  intensity.  Comparison  of  the  values  for  D  with  the 

diffusion coefficients for thermal oxygen diffusion in iron at 300 K suggests an enhancement 

due to irradiation of 6 orders of magnitude.

1. Introduction 

In  the  context  of  long  term  geological  storage,  high  level  nuclear  wastes  will  be  placed  in 

stainless  steel  containers  surrounded  by  a  low  alloyed  carbon  steel  overpack  as  a  second 

barrier. These containers will be exposed to humid air and mainly to g  irradiation. 

In  this  context,  we  propose  a  fundamental  study  to  better  understand  the  corrosion 

mechanisms  of  pure  iron,  considered  as  a  model  material,  under  proton  irradiation.  The 

irradiation  effect  was  studied  by  using  a  3  MeV  proton  beam  characterised  mainly  by  an 

electronic stopping power. We have chosen proton irradiation for two main reasons. First, the 

protons  produce  a  high  ionisation  density  correlated  with  a  high  electronic  stopping  power 

compared  to  g   irradiation.  Second,  the  beam  energy  control  allows  to  study  the  corrosion 

process precisely at the iron/atmosphere interface. 

In  a  recent  review  paper  [1],  the  atmospheric  corrosion  mechanisms  occurring  inside  a  rust 

layer during a wet-dry cycle were presented. This modelling demonstrated the enhancement 

of iron corrosion by the joint influence of oxygen and water. 

The  aim  of  the  present  work  is  to  study  the  iron  corrosion  kinetics  in  air  with  a  relative 

humidity (RH) of 45% and under proton irradiation. We will first present evidence for oxygen 

and  hydrogen  migration  in  the  corrosion  layer  which  was  characterised  by  Rutherford 

Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) and Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA). Then, in 

order to attempt to identify the crystalline phases in the corrosion products formed on the iron 

samples, the results of X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) characterisation will be presented. Finally, 

we will focus on the modelling of the corrosion iron kinetics as a function of the proton beam 

intensities.

2. Experimental 

2.1 Irradiation conditions 

 

 

 

 

The  studied  material  was  a  thin  iron  foil  (99.85%  purity),  10  µm  thick,  provided  by 

Goodfellow. This foil could not be polished because it was too thin. In the following, it will 

be  referred  to  as  the  initial  sample.  The  irradiation  experiments  were  performed  using  the       

4  MV  Van  de  Graaff  accelerator  of  the  Nuclear  Physics  Institute  of  Lyon  (IPNL)  which 

delivers a 3 MeV proton beam characterised mainly by an electronic energy deposition (the 

linear  energy  transfer  is  equal  to  3x10-2  keV  µm-1).  The  proton  beam  is  extracted  from  the 

beam  line  vacuum  (10-3  Pa)  to  the  atmosphere  by  crossing  a  5  µm  thick  havar  (Co/Cr/Ni 

alloy) window. The external proton beam enters the irradiation cell through the studied iron 

foil and stops in water. The experimental set up is displayed in Fig. 1. The relative humidity 

of the air in the 8 mm thick gap between the havar window and the iron foil was controlled 

and  measured  throughout  the  experiment  using  a  Hygropalm  humidity  controller.  The 

measured RH and temperature were 45 –

 2 % and 300 K respectively. The irradiation line was 

equipped with a sweeping system which allowed a homogeneous irradiation over the whole 

iron  surface  (5x5  mm).  During  irradiation,  the  beam  intensity  was  constant  and  measured 

carefully  with  a  beam  chopper  that  had  previously  been  calibrated.  Three  intensities  (5,  10 

and 20 nA) were used. 

2.2 Analysis conditions 

For each irradiation condition, the iron surface in contact with the humid air was analysed by 

using  ion  beam  analysis  performed  on  the  IPNL  4  MV  Van  de  Graaff  accelerator.  RBS 

coupled with ERDA were used to determine the corrosion layer evolution. For RBS analysis, 

a 172° detection angle was used while the alpha incident particles energy was adjusted to 1.7 

3 

or  3  MeV  depending  on  the  oxide  layer  thickness.  ERDA  analysis  was  induced  using  1.7 

MeV a

 particles. The incident angle on the target and the detection angle were respectively 

15° and 30°. A 6.5 µm thick polymer (mylar) absorber was placed in front of the Si detector 

to stop the backscattered a

 particles. In such conditions, the depth resolution was close to 20 

nm in iron. 

The  SIMNRA  program  was  used  to  simulate  the  energy  spectra  obtained  both  by  RBS  and 

ERDA so as to determine the atomic concentration profiles of iron, oxygen and hydrogen. 

3. Characterisation of the corrosion layers induced by irradiation  

Oxygen and hydrogen profiles are presented respectively in Fig. 2 and 3 both for the initial 

sample  and  the  irradiated  ones.  The  oxygen  profiles  show  a  continuous  decrease  with 

increasing depth, both for the initial sample and the irradiated ones. The irradiation effect is 

clearly  shown  by  the  strong  oxygen  concentration  enhancement.  In  contrast,  the  hydrogen 

profile corresponding to the initial sample displays a very superficial contamination whereas 

the irradiated ones show an uniform and high concentration level extending into the iron. 

In order to discuss the stoichiometry variation of this corrosion layer, we have plotted in Fig.4 

the  CO/CFe  atomic  concentration  ratio  as  a  function  of  the  irradiation  time  at  three  different 

depths:  the  surface  (Fig.  4a),  at  50  nm  (Fig.  4b)  and  at  100  nm  (Fig.  4c).  Each  ratio  was 

calculated for a step equal to the resolution depth. The CO/CFe ratio value corresponding to the 

chosen depth in the initial sample is shown by a black spot located at t = 0. For each depth, 

these ratios are compared to the FeOOH and FeO stoichiometries which are the two extreme 

iron oxidation states of rust (i.e. Fe(II) and Fe(III)). At the surface (Fig. 4a), for the 10 and 20 

nA beam intensities, we observe that after an irradiation of 30 minutes the CO/CFe ratio stands 

between 1.5 and 2; whereas at 50 nm it stands around 1 (Fig. 4b) and at 100 nm it is below 1 

 

 

 

4 

(Fig.  4c).  In  the  case  of  the  5  nA  irradiation  intensity,  the  CO/CFe  ratio  was  systematically 

lower than 1 but higher than that of the initial sample. In addition, we have plotted in figure 5 

the  CH/CO  atomic  concentration  ratio  as  a  function  of  the  irradiation  time  at  three  different 

depths:  the  surface  (Fig.  5a),  a  50  nm  depth  (Fig.  5b)  and  a  100  nm  depth  (Fig.  5c).  These 

ratios are compared to the FeOOH stoichiometry. The CH/CO ratio corresponding to the initial 

sample  is  shown  by  a  black  spot  at  t  =  0.  At  the  surface,  it  quickly  reaches  a  value  of  0.4, 

whatever the irradiation intensity. At the depths of 50 nm and 100 nm, the ratio value is about 

0.25 irrespective the irradiation. It shows that the CH/CO ratio is always lower than the one of 

FeOOH. From these results, we can assume that the corrosion product is composed of mixed 

hydroxides and oxides as previously observed [3].  

Classical X-ray diffraction experiments were performed on the 45 min irradiated samples and 

on the initial sample and the results are presented in Fig. 6. The main peaks of the Fe3O4 and 

b -FeOOH phases [2] are marked by arrows on this figure. On the initial sample (Fig. 6a), we 

observe a large diffraction peak centred at a 2q   angle of 18° which corresponds to the surface 

oxide layer. From the large width of the X-ray diffraction peaks, we can assume that the layer 

structure is almost amorphous. On Fig. 6b, the X-ray diffraction pattern corresponding to the 

samples irradiated at different intensities are presented. From this comparison, it appears that 

as the incident proton flux increases, a balance occurs between two crystallographic structures 

which correspond to the peaks observed respectively at 18° and 36°. At a beam intensity of 5 

nA, only the 18° contribution is observed. At 10 and 20 nA, this peak progressively vanishes 

However, these results can only give some hints to the mineral phases but are insufficient to 

and the peak at 36° increases.  

clearly identify these phases.  

4. Modelling the corrosion kinetics 

 

 

5 

 

 

In this part, we focus on the kinetics of oxide growth during the corrosion process induced by 

irradiation. In order to identify the oxygen migration mechanism, we have used the relation: 

mO(t) = A tn   (1) 

where mO(t) is the oxygen mass gain, t the irradiation time and A and n are constants [3]. 

As  shown  in  Fig.  7,  which  displays  log  mO(t)  versus  log  t,  with  the  experimental  results 

represented by dots, the straight lines obtained have the same slopes, whatever the irradiation 

intensity. Hence, the corrosion mechanism does not depend on the beam intensity. The value 

of n deduced from Fig. 7 is 0.75 –

 0.07 with R2 = 0.98. Therefore we applied a model based 

on the Crank  mathematical resolution of the Fick’s equations [4,5] which has recently been 

used in the case of zirconium oxidation under irradiation [6]. Fick’s second law equation was 

applied  by  considering  that  the  diffusion  coefficient  D  is  independent  of  the  oxygen 

concentration C(x,t).

at t = 0 is C(x,0) = 0   

(3) 

The initial condition takes into account the fact that the oxygen concentration in the iron bulk 

As a result on the irradiation process, the oxygen atomic concentration at the surface is time 

dependent. The flux of oxygen entry into the iron surface is expressed as: 

J(0,t) = K[Cs

0-Cs(t)],    

(4) 

where  K  is  the  kinetic  constant  of  the  oxygen  surface  exchange,  Cs(t)  is  the  oxygen 

concentration at the surface at a time t, and 

0

sC  is the oxygen concentration at equilibrium. 

Our  experimental  results  show  that  the  surface  composition  is  a  mixture  of  oxide  and 

hydroxide  phases  which  composition  depends  on  the  irradiation  conditions.  Indeed,  if  we 

consider two extreme cases of composition ratio (100% for Fe3O4 or 100% for FeOOH), the

sC   values  remain  very  close  and  respectively  equal  to  5.2x1022  cm-3  and 

5.8x1022 at cm-3. Hence, a mean value is taken in the calculation of the diffusion coefficient 

corresponding  to  a  mixture  of  50  at.%  for  Fe3O4  and  50  at.%  for  FeOOH.  This  approach 

allows calculation of the oxygen concentration as function of depth and time and expression 

of J(0,t). The rate of increase of the mass of oxygen in the metal due to irradiation, mO(t), is 

given by:

A comparison between the theoretical and experimental values is given in Fig. 8 where M(t) 

is  plotted  versus  time.  The  D  and  K  values  deduced  from  this  fit  are  given  in  Table  1.  The 

accuracy is estimated to be 20%. Comparison of the values for D in Table 1 with the diffusion 

coefficients for thermal oxygen diffusion in iron at 300 K [7] suggests an enhancement due to 

irradiation of 6 orders of magnitude  

For the irradiation intensities of 10 and 20 nA, the K values were the same and correlated to a 

CH/CO  surface  ratio  close  to  0.4.  In  case  of  the  5  nA  irradiation  intensity,  the  K  value  was 

smaller as expected by the large CH/CO surface value (0.9). 

The oxygen diffusion coefficients increase classically with the beam intensity [5]. Indeed the 

diffusion process is controlled by the density of defects produced by irradiation. 

5. Discussion 

 

 

 

Under  irradiation,  O2

•  and  HO

•
  radicals  amongst  others  are  created  in  humid  air.  Their 

radiolytic yield is given in the literature [8,9]. Under our irradiation conditions, the calculated 

concentrations  of  these  radicals  do  not  allow  an  explanation  of  the  important  oxidation 

process observed. In order to explain it, we can assume that there are adsorbed species at the 

7 

-
iron surface and that the proton beam enhances significantly the migration of these species as 

well  as  their  interactions.  The  excess  of  hydrogen  can  be  explained  by  the  formation  of 

H+(H2O)n  clusters,  as  already  discussed  in  the  literature  [10],  which  shows  that  80%  of  the 

charged species are in the form H+(H2O)n as soon as 1 at.% of vapour water is present in the 

air. This relative humidity corresponds to our experimental conditions.

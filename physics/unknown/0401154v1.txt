     Introduction:  The  creation  and  evolution  of  the
region of planetesimals known as the Kuiper Belt has
recently  become  an  important  topic  of  study  in  the
field of planetary formation. The Kuiper Belt is made
up of a very large number of planetesimals that orbit
the Sun at distances beyond Neptune, perhaps even as
far  away  as  1,000  AU  [1].  These  planetesimals  are
believed to either be relics of the planetary formation
process  that  originated  in  this  transNeptunian region
and  avoided  subsequent  close  encounters,  or
planetesimals  that  were  created  closer  to  the  central
star  only  to  be  scattered  outward  by  larger
protoplanets. The stability of the planetesimals in the
Kuiper Belt is governed primarily by the gravitational
influence  (or  lack  thereof)  of  Neptune.  It  has  been
shown that most bodies in the Kuiper Belt with high
orbital  eccentricities  are  found  in  mean  motion
resonances with Neptune. Planetesimals with modest
eccentricities and high inclinations (resulting in orbits
that are stable over periods comparable to the age of
the  planetary  system)  are  able  to  avoid  being
perturbed  out  of  their  orbits  since  their  perihelia  are
well separated from Neptune [2].
     It has recently been suggested that scattering
mechanisms  created  by  mutual  gravitational
interactions  could  cause  inward  migration  by
protoplanets  as  well  as  the  formation  of  planetary
system  features  such  as  the  Kuiper  Belt  [3].  This
could  explain  the  discovery  of  extrasolar  hot
Jupiters,  which are currently thought to have formed
in larger orbits and then moved closer to their parent
stars  via  some  migration  mechanism  [4].    By
numerically  modeling  the  effects  of  one  or  more
growing  protoplanets  on  a  ring  of  planetesimals,  it
should  be  possible  to  determine  the  point  in  its
evolution  at  which  it  had  the  most  influence  on  the
protoplanetary system, scattering bodies outward and
creating  structures  similar  to  the  Kuiper  Belt.
Conversely,  this  would  also  correspond  to  the  time
period  during  which  the  evolving  protoplanet would
be able to move inward due to such interactions.

 The numerical model

     Simulation Model:
employed  by  this  study  calculated  planetesimal and
protoplanet  trajectories  using  a  fifth-order  Runge-
Kutta  algorithm.  Individual  trajectories  were
determined  considering  the  mutual  gravitational
forces  between  the  planetesimals  and  protoplanet.
temporal  evolution  of  an  annulus  of
The 

planetesimals  and  a  larger  protoplanet  at  one  of  its
edges  was  examined.  The  initial  planetesimal
velocity distribution was defined as Keplerian.
     In the first six simulations, 500  planetesimals with
varying masses were examined, beginning in circular
orbits  with  their  semiajor  axes  scattered  randomly
between 10 and 20 AU. Orbital inclinations were also
randomly  selected.  The  planetesimal  masses  and
maximum  orbital  inclinations  are  given  in  Table  1.
The simulations were run to model the evolution over
a period of ten thousand years.

     In the other four simulations, one thousand
planetesimals  were  assumed,  beginning  in  circular,
coplanar  (inclination  equal  to  zero)  orbits  with  their
semimajor  axes  scattered  randomly  between  15  and
25  AU.  Each  planetesimal  was  given  a  mass  one-
tenth that of the mass of the Earth. A protoplanet with
a  varying  mass  was  located  at  the  outer  edge  of  the
planetesimal  annulus  (25  AU)  as  given  in  Table  2.
The  protoplanet s  mass  was  varied  to  determine  the
critical mass for disk scattering and its relationship to
both  planetesimal  and  protoplanet migration. This is
of vital importance since this should determine when
the growing protoplanet has its maximum impact on
the  evolution  of  the  protoplanetary  system.  These
simulations  examined  the  system s  evolution  over  a
span of five thousand years.

     Results and Conclusions:  In simulations with a
protoplanet  located  at  the  outer  edge  of  the
planetesimal  ring,  more  planetesimals  than  in  the
case  without  the  protoplanet  were  scattered  both
inward and outward from the initial limits of the ring.
As  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  1,  the  average  eccentricities
for  the  planetesimals  scattered  inward  are  generally
smaller  than  the  minimum  value  (or  stability  limit)

for them to undergo subsequent close encounters with
the protoplanet. The stability limit corresponds to the
eccentricity  required  for  the  aphelion  (if  the
planetesimal is closer to the star than the protoplanet)
or  the  perihelion  (if  the  planetesimal is farther away
from  the  star  than  the  protoplanet)  to  allow  the
planetesimal s  orbit  to  cross  that  of  the  protoplanet.
This infers that gravitational interactions between the
planetesimals themselves are a possible cause of this
inward scattering.

Conversely,  the  average  eccentricities  for  outwardly
scattered planetesimals  are  well  above  the  minimum
value  needed  for  close  protoplanet-planetesimal
encounters to occur. This suggests that such events in
the  past  may  have  been  responsible  for  outward
scattering events. The outward flow of planetesimals

All collisions were found to be inelastic, although the
algorithm  was  equipped  to  resolve  elastic  collisions.
The  data  shows  that  the  presence  of  a  single  larger
object  in  the  vicinity  of  a  ring  of  planetesimals
produces  an  instability  in  the  disk.  This  causes
planetesimals to be scattered out of the region (or the
protoplanetary  system  altogether)  at  a  much  faster
rate than if there were no larger objects to disturb the
planetesimal disk.

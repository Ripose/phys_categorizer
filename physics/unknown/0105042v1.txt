The  study  of  metallic  nanoparticles  has  a  long  tradition  in  linear  and  nonlinear 
optics1, with current emphasis on the ultrafast dynamics, size, shape and collective 
effects  in  their  optical  response2  3  4  5  6.  Nanoparticles  also  represent  the  ultimate 
confined geometry: high surface-to-volume ratios lead to local field enhancements 
and  a  range  of  dramatic  modifications  of  the  material’s  properties  and  phase 
diagram7 8 9. Confined gallium has become a subject of special interest as the light-
induced  structural  phase  transition  recently  observed  in  gallium  films10  11  has 
allowed for the  demonstration of all-optical  switching devices that operate at low 
laser  power12.  Spontaneous  self-assembly  has  been  the  main  approach  to  the 
preparation  of  nanoparticles  (for  a  review  see  13).  Here  we  report  that  light  can 
dramatically  influence  the  nanoparticle  self-assembly  process:  illumination  of  a 
substrate  exposed  to  a  beam  of  gallium  atoms  results  in  the  formation  of 
nanoparticles with a relatively narrow size distribution. Very low light intensities, 
below the threshold for thermally-induced evaporation, exert considerable control 
over  nanoparticle  formation  through  non-thermal  atomic  desorption  induced  by 
electronic excitation. 

We  studied  nanoparticle  formation  at  the  end  of  an  optical  fibre  exposed  to  a 
beam  of  gallium  atoms  in  vacuum  (see  fig.  1).  This  arrangement  allowed  us  to 
accurately  control  the  deposition  conditions  and  simultaneously  to  probe  the  optical 
properties  of  the  developing  structures.  Our  experiments  were  conducted  in  a  vacuum 
chamber evacuated to ~10-6 mbar during the deposition process. We used single-mode 
silica  optical  fibres,  with  core  and  cladding  diameters  of  9  and  125  µm  respectively. 
One end of the fibre was freshly cleaved and attached to a cold-finger in the chamber 
that  could  be  cooled  by  liquid  nitrogen  flow  to  100  K.  It  was  exposed  to  a  beam  of 
gallium atoms from a K-cell to form a semi-reflective layer on the cleaved face of the 
fibre.  In  most  of  our  experiments  Gallium  was  deposited  at  a  rate  of  ~0.3  nm/min 
(measured  with  a  quartz  balance).  The  other  end  of  the  fibre  (outside  the  vacuum 
chamber)  was  connected  to  a  diode  laser  operating  at  1.5  µm,  producing  1  µs  pulses 
with  peak  powers  of  17  mW  at  a  rate  of  1  kHz  (an  average  power  of  17  µW).  After 

 

2

deposition fibres were removed from the vacuum chamber and examined using optical 
and Atomic Force Microscopes (AFM). 

We first deposited gallium on a fibre tip at room temperature for thirty minutes 
in  the  absence  of  any  laser  light  and  found  that  a  glossy  feature-less  mirror-like  layer 
was  formed  (AFM  scans,  with  resolution  down  to  a  few  nanometers,  showed  that  the 
surface was flat). In our second experiment the fibre was cooled to 100 K. In this case, 
thirty  minutes  of  deposition  (again  without  light  present)  produced  a  uniform,  rough 
layer of gallium. An AFM scan of the fibre tip revealed that the gallium was in lumps of 
all  shapes  and  sizes  from  a  few  nanometers  to  several  hundred  nanometers.  Next  we 
performed  deposition  on  a  fibre  cooled  to  100  K  with  the  laser  switched  on.  Thirty 
minutes  of  deposition  now  led  to  the  formation  of  a  layer  with  two  distinct  parts (see 
photograph fig. 2a, and AFM image fig. 2b). Outside the fibre’s core the structure was 
identical to that produced in the previous experiment with no laser light present, but at 
the core a highly reflective area was formed. Further AFM scans revealed that this area 
comprised a layer of gallium nanoparticles of relatively uniform size, typically ~80 nm 
in  diameter  (fig.  2c).  We  found  that  if  the  fibre  tip  was  more  than  ~1  mm  from  the 
supporting surface of the cold finger, it was not effectively cooled and the bright area at 
the core was not formed. To determine whether the light-assisted nanoparticle formation 
took place during deposition or during warming to room temperature we performed two 
experiments  (both  with  thirty  minutes  of  deposition  on  fibres  at  100  K):  one  with  the 
laser  on  during  deposition  and  off  while  warming  the  fibre;  and  another  with  light 
absent  during  deposition  but  present  while  the  fibre  was  warmed.  Only  in  the  first  of 
these  experiments,  with  light  during  deposition,  was  a  well-defined  reflective  area  of 
nanoparticles formed  at  the  fibre’s core. Finally, we  replaced the  laser with a 0.8 mW 
continuous wave diode laser operating at 1.31 µm and once more deposited gallium for 
thirty  minutes  on  a  fibre  cooled  to  100  K.  This  laser  had  some  effect  on  the  gallium, 
however  it  produced  only  a  diffuse  reflective  area  at  the  fibre’s  core  rather  than  the 
well-defined  highly  reflective  region  produced  by  the  pulsed  laser.  In  summary,  we 
found  that  the  presence  of  laser  pulses  during  deposition  and  efficient  cooling  of  the 
fibre tip are essential for the creation of nanoparticles at the core. 

The  difference  between  areas  illuminated  during  deposition  and  those  not 
illuminated  becomes  even  more  obvious  when  gallium  is  deposited  at  a  very  low  rate 
for  several  hours.  In  this  case  the  large  blobs  of  gallium  separated  by  tens of  microns 
form in areas not exposed to the lasers but at the fibre’s core an isolated cluster of well 
defined nanoparticles develops (see fig. 3). 

Our  experiments  indicate  that  the  following  sequence  of  events  takes  place 
during formation of gallium nanoparticles in an illuminated area. Gallium, deposited at 
a  low  rate  (~0.3  nm/min)  initially  forms  seeding  clusters  on  the  surface  of  the  silica 
substrate through surface diffusion and nucleation. Since gallium wets silica in vacuum 
rather well14 the initial shape of the  nucleated particles formed at low deposition rates 
has  a  high  area-to-height  aspect  ratio15.  The  clusters  grow  preferentially  across  the 
surface,  increasing  their  aspect  ratio  and  space  fill  factor.  A  reasonable  model  for 
calculating  their  optical  properties  can  be  based  on  cylinders  of  gallium  with  radii 
bigger than their height, or highly truncated spheres. Due to depolarization effects16 and 
collective  dipole-dipole  interactions  between  particles  and  substrate17  the  absorption

cross-section  of  the  nanoparticle18  depends  on  the  dielectric  properties  of  both  the 
substrate  and  the  particle  bulk  material,  filling  factor  and  particle  size,  but  most 
importantly on the shape of the nanoparticle, i.e. aspect ratio. Although we do not know 
precisely  the  crystalline  phase  of  the  particles,  their  dielectric  parameters  must  lie 
between those of semi-metallic α-gallium, which is the stable bulk phase under normal 
conditions19, and those of crystalline phases such as Ga-II, Ga-III and β-Ga which have 
free-electron-like  optical  properties20  21.  We  therefore  calculated,  using  the  theory 
developed  in  references  16-18,  the  absorption  cross-section  of  α-  and  free-electron 
gallium nanoparticles with different aspect ratios. In α-gallium, atoms form covalently 
bound dimers which were assumed in our calculations to be aligned perpendicular to the 
substrate. This is the preferred orientation for gallium dimers at a hard wall22, although 
even  without  this  assumption  the  results  of  the  calculations  remain  largely  the  same. 
Data  on  the  dispersion  of  the  dielectric  coefficients  in  α-gallium  were  taken  from 
Kofman  et  al23,  and  for  free-electron  gallium  from  Hunderi  and  Ryberg24.  The 
calculations  show  that  in  both  cases  the  absorption  cross-section  at  1.55µm  increases 
rapidly with aspect ratio, and thus with the size of the particles (fig. 4). 

Consequently,  laser  excitation  in  the  infrared  part  of  the  spectrum  will  show 
better coupling  with bigger particles - they will be more strongly excited (see fig. 4a). 
This  leads  to  a  higher  rate  of  desorption  of  gallium  atoms  from  bigger  particles.  As 
noted  by  Vollmer  and  Trager25,  atoms  located  at  the  edges  or  perimeters  of 
nanoparticles  have  particularly  low  binding  energies  and  will  evaporate  preferentially. 
This  size-selective  evaporation  will  terminate  the  growth  process  in  bigger  particles. 
Therefore,  when  light  is  present  in  the  fibre,  it  slows  down  the  formation  of  bigger 
particles and prevents the formation of particles above a certain size, but has little effect 
on the formation of smaller particles. Consequently the particle size distribution remains 
narrow.  This  model  is  consistent  with  the  layers’  optical  transmission  measurements 
which were taken in-situ immediately after deposition. The transmission, at 1.55µm, of 
the mirror exposed to light during deposition was about 18 times higher than that of an 
unexposed mirror. This is related to the fact that large gallium nanoparticles, which are 
more strongly absorbing, are not created when light is present during deposition, but can 
form in the absence of light.  

Important  features  of  our  experiment  are  the  low  intensity  and  relatively  long 
duration of the optical pulses used. We modeled the temperature increase ∆T resulting 
from  light  absorption  in  our  experiments  by  numerically  solving  the  thermal 
conductivity equation for a disk-like nanoparticle using the Green’s function technique26 
and  found  the  maximum  increase  to  be  ~80  K.  This  relatively  small  increase  cannot 
affect  the  evaporation  rate.  Indeed,  in  gallium  nanoparticles  the  activation  energy  for 
atomic  desorption  is  2.5  eV  [ref.  27].  This  is  more  than  100  times  higher  then  the 
maximum value of kbT , making thermal desorption, whose rate is proportional to exp(-
Eg/kbT),  a  forbidden  process.  We  believe  that  the  increased  rate  of  desorption  in  our 
experiments is the consequence of a non-thermal process related to electronic excitation 
of  the  particles.  In  literature  this  mechanism  is  called  DIET:  Desorption  Induced  by 
Electronic  Transitions,  and  has  been  studied  in  potassium,  sodium  and  silver28.  This 
non-thermal  mechanism  should  be  especially  important  for  α-gallium  because  its 
crystalline  structure  contains  covalently  bound  gallium  dimers,  Ga2  molecules.

Importantly,  gallium’s  bonding-antibonding  absorption  line  encompasses  the  1.3  and 
1.55 µm wavelengths used in our experiments29. Our results suggest that when optical 
stimulation  excites  a  dimer  from  the  bonding  to  the  antibonding  state  the  activation 
energy  of  atomic  desorbtion  from  the  nanoparticle  is  dramatically  reduced,  thus 
allowing  a  non-thermal  particle  size  control  mechanism  to  operate  at  very  low  light 
intensity levels.  

When  the  deposition  process  is  completed  and  the  fibre  is  brought  to  room 
temperature, the clusters melt and form the slightly truncated spheres seen in the AFM 
images. Comparison of the transmission characteristics of the mirrors immediately after 
deposition  and  shortly after bringing the mirror to room temperature, i.e. after melting 
of  gallium  islands  is  consistent  with  this  model.  Indeed,  the  transmission increases  by 
about  60%  for  mirrors  exposed  to  light  during  deposition,  and  by  factor  of  25  for 
mirrors that were not. Clearly, as absorption is higher for higher aspect ratios, when the 
gallium  islands  with  high  aspect  ratios  are  converted  into  truncated  spheres  with  low 
aspect  ratios  on  melting,  there  is  a  greater  change  in  absorption  for  mirrors  which 
initially had particles with high aspect ratios, i.e. mirrors which had not been exposed to 
light  during  deposition.  An  additional  increase  in  the  particles’  sphericity  may  be 
expected when the mirror is brought into contact with air. Such a change in the shape is 
due  to  the  higher  wetting  angles  (due  to  oxidation)  between  gallium  and  silica  under 
normal atmospheric conditions, as compared to vacuum conditions17. 

It  is  worth  comparing  our  optical  excitation  energy  levels  with  those  used  for 
post-growth narrowing of the size distribution of silver and gold nanoparticles30. In size-
selective  evaporation  of  silver  clusters  the  energy  densities  used  were  100  and  150 
mJ/cm2, corresponding to peak intensities on the silver target of 14 and 21 MW/cm2. In 
our  experiments  with  light-controlled  deposition,  some  effect  on  particle  formation  is 
seen with continuous laser excitation at intensities of just 1.2 kW/cm2, about four orders 
of  magnitude  lower  than  the  levels  used  in  post-growth  narrowing.  With  pulsed  laser 
excitation we observe a formidable light-assisted nanoparticle formation effect at levels 
of 28 kW/cm2, still about 700 times lower than the post-growth narrowing levels. 

In  conclusion,  we  report  that  the  formation  of  metallic  nanoparticles  can  be 
induced  at  very  low  intensity  levels  by  light-induced  desorption  of  atoms  during  the 
process of deposition from an atomic beam. We expect that by changing the excitation 
wavelength  or  the  atomic  beam  intensity,  the  size  and  spatial  distribution  of  gallium 
nanoparticles can be controlled.

absorption  cross-section  is  seen  with  increasing  aspect  ratio,  and  therefore  with 
increasing particle size.

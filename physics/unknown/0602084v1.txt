IN 7 AND IN 10 DIMENSIONS

Abstract

Extra dimensions are introduced: 3 in Classical Mechanics and 6 in Relativistic Mechanics, which

represent orientations, resulting from rotations, of a particle, described by quaternions, and leading to a

7-dimensional, respectively 10-dimensional, world. The concept of spin is thus defined in both cases,

which results  to be  different  from angular momentum.  It leads to the  known concept  of Quantum

Mechanical spin in both cases. In particular, application of these new ideas to (Relativistic) Quantum

Mechanics,   leads   to   quantization   of   energy  levels   in  free  electrons,   which   could   be   in   principle

detectable via their spectrum, confirming the theory.

1. Introduction

It is very well known the old dispute in Philosophy between idealism and matterialism. Namely,

on  the  one  hand  idealism  claims   that  the  only true   reality is  the  world   of   ideas,   studied  by

Mathematics. The physical world then, studied by physics, is merely a kind of reflection of the

world of ideas. On the other  hand, matterialism claims that the only true reality is the physical

world. The world of ideas is then obtained by merely a deduction from the physical world. In any

case both agree in stating that there is a correspondence between these two worlds and this is

which we are interested in concerning the pressent work.

In view of the above complete equivalence between these two worlds, it does not matter from

which one will start in order to arrive at the other. In the present context, I think it is more natural

and convenient to start from the physical world of Physics in order to go to the world of ideas of

Mathematics. Namely we will consider the notion of a point in Physics to construct the concept of

point in Mathematics.

As we all know our world or our (physical) space is, setting Relativity aside as a first step, three-

dimensional (setting time apart at present). This is the same as stating that the “position” of a

point is determined by three numbers, the three (spatial) coordinates. The point is thus considered

to have no “magnitude” in itself, visualized as being the limiting object, taken from a real object,

having a finite volume, if it is shrunk to zero (volume).

But we also know that a finite object possesses orientation, with respect to the coordinate axes, in

addition to  position.  If we srink the object, keeping it “similar” (homeothetous)  to itself at the

same time, it will obviously retain its orientation. It seems to me as paradox the fact that when

we arrive at the  limit  of a  point,  the orientation  disappears.  It is evidently more reasonal to

consider that the orientation “survives” in the limit. And thus to adopt the concept of an oriented

point, and the associated orientation space at a given position.

But the set of all orientations at a given position obviously results from an arbitrary orientation by

performing all possible rotations of it. On the other hand each possible rotation can be analyzed

to three rotations, each of them taking place on each of the three (3) coordinate planes (xy, yz, zx)

Thus, the orientation space has to be three-dimensional. This conclusion can also result from the

fact that the  rotation of an extended body is specified by its  three  (3) Eulerian angles. Now

mathematically the concept of such a rotation is described by a quaternion.  Thus we are led to

describe the orientations of a point by quaternions.

In this way we conclude that we have to add three numbers (related with orientation) to the usual

three coordinates (related to position) in order to describe a point. Thus, if we add the time, we

are led to the conclusion that our world is seven-dimensional!

In Relativity, as we all know, the position of a point in Minkowski space is determined by four

(4) coordinates. This is the case because space and time are now unified. In the same manner as

before we have to associate now to the four-dimensional space-time and to each position the set

of all orientations  of a four-dimensional coordinate system. This is evidently the same with the

set of all  rotations  of this four-dimensional coordinate system. These are  six.  Three of them

express rotations of the space alone as before. The other three, expressing pure boosts (Lorentz

transformations), are specified by “rotations” on each of the planes xt, yt, zt. Thus we arrive at a

new conception, the one of a (4+3+3=10) ten-dimensional world! The present paper is but a first

attempt to grasp this world.

Note that extra dimensions are already in use in modern quantum field theory. They are (ten in

number, too) involved mainly in the theory of superstrings, through which they were introduced.

But the nature of these extra dimensions is not specified, being something complettely irrelevant

to the ideas exposed above.

2. Classical Mechanics in 7 dimensions

i) Introduction of quaternions

Figure 1Eulerian angles (θ, φ, ψ) of "inner" orientation (x1, x2, x3) of point A relative to system K (X, Y, Z). AN is the
section of plane (X, Y) with plane (x1, x2). The system k (x, y, z) is the usual position frame.

Consider a cartesian and rectangular coordinate system (k) in space with axes (x, y, z). to an

arbitrary point A its three coordinates x, y, z are attributed. According to the established ideas these

three   coordinates   are  enough  in  order   to   completely specify  the  point. We  accept  that   these   three

coordinatess are not enough, and that each point A possesses an “orientation” described by the three

Eulerian angles, for example, (θ, φ, ψ) relative to a cartesian and rectangular coordinate system (K)

with origin at A and axes (X, Y, Z), as in fig. 1 (see also Landau & Lifshitz, 1976, for the analog with

respect to a rigid body). Then the  (generalized) coordinates qi of A are six, namely (x, y, z; θ, φ, ψ) and

the physical space is six-dimensional, or the world is seven-dimensional, if we add the time t. In order

for the orientations (θ, φ, ψ) of points at different positions (x, y, z) to be comparable, we take the K-

systems at different positions to have their axes (X, Y, Z) parallel to one another, but not necessarilly

parallel to (x, y, z) (exept as a special case).

The displacement of a position A relative to O is OA. If the displacement of a position B relative to A

is AB, then the displacement of B relative to O is given by OA+AB. In other words the “composition”

of positions is given by the usual vector addition. But concerning the “composition” of “orientations” at

A, these orientations must be viewed as “rotations” of A from (X, Y, Z) to (x1, x2, x3). Then, in order

to have the rule for the “composition” of these “rotations”, the latter must be described in terms of

quaternions.  Then   the   “composition”   of   “orientations”   is   given   by   the   usual   composition   of

quaternions. Supposse that the orientation (θ, φ, ψ) of A is thus given by the quaternion

(see Misner, Thorne & Wheeler, 1973). The quaternion (1) is described by the four parameters θ and

(cosα,   cosβ,  cosγ).   But  in   the  four-dimensional  space  of  quaternions   we are  restricted  on  a three-

dimensional hypersurface only, given that

This hyper-surface can be described by the three components of the vector θ, whose magnitude is θ and

direction is n. Thus each quaternion R can be described by a vector θR in (K), with the only difference

that  with   regard  to   composition   we   have  to   adopt   the   composition   of   quaternions   rather   than   the

composition of vectors.

ii) The Lagrangian of a particle and its moment of inertia

Suppose now that we have a free material point  A fixed in position space. Then its Lagrangian will

not   obviously   depend   on   its   position   coordinates   and   on   their   corresponding   velocities.   The

Lagrangian will  not  also depend on time,  because of  the homogeneity of time.  Futhermore, we

assume that the orientation space is homogeneous, reflecting the isotropy of the position space. Then

the Lagrangian will not depend on the orientation (x1, x2, x3) relative to (X, Y, Z), depending only

on the rate of change of orientation, that is on the angular velocity ω of (x1, x2, x3) relative to (X,

Y, Z). Because also all orientations of (x1, x2, x3) are equivalent, the Lagrangian will not depend on

the direction of ω relative to (X, Y, Z), but only on its magnitude ω2 and, perhaps, on its direction

relative to (x1, x2, x3), expressed by its three direction cosines α, β, γ, being the components of a

unit vector n. Thus:


wnLL
,(

=

2

).
       

(4)

   

Suppose now that, leaving the direction n unaffected, we increase ω by dω to ω´ = ω + dω. Since the

equations of motion retain the same form regardless of the substitution ω → ω´, it is evident that the

“new” Lagrangian will be

=¢

L


,(
nL

2

).
          

But because exactly both L and L´ must lead to equations of motion of the same form, they must

differ only by a total time derivative of a function of orientation coordinates (see Landau & Lifshitz,

1976). Expanding L´ to first order in dω, we have

coordinates, it must be linear in the rate of change of orientation. This can happen only if ∂L/∂ω² is

independent of ω², L thus being “proportional” to ω². Therefore, we can write

=

(6)

Where the “constant” of proportionality I may depend in general on n, and it is called the “moment

of inertia” about the n axis. As in the case of the mass of the particle, it can be shown that I is always

positive (see Landau & Lifshitz, 1976).

Now, suppose that we fix ω² in L and we change α, β, γ - which we call αi (i = 1, 2, 3) – from αi to

α´i = αi + dαi. Then L will be changed from L = L(αi, ω²) to L´ = L(α´i, ω²). Expanding it to first

order we find

+=¢
L

L

(7)

Because with this change L must retain the same form, it must transform in the same manner with

αi.   But,   because   it   is   about   a   rotation,   dαi   are   expressed   as   linear   combinations   of   αi   with

infinitesimal coefficients. Because then Σ(∂L/∂αi)dαi has to be expressed in the same way, it follows

that  ∂L/∂αi must be linear in αj´s and, therefore, that L is a quadratic form with respect to the

direction cosines. Thus, extracting (½)ω² as a common factor, we can write

with the eigenvalues positive. We assume that (in general) I1 < I2 < I3. From the three “principal

moments   of  inertia”   I1,  I2,  I3  we  have  that   I1  is   the  (absolute)   minimum,   I3  is   the   (absolute)

maximum, and I2 is a saddle point of the quadratic form I(α, β, γ). The three eigenvectors are normal

to one another and define the three principal axes of inertia. We will always, from now on, take as

orientation (x1, x2, x3) of the particle the one defined by the three principal axes of inertia. Then the

quadratic form (8) takes the form

If the material point is fixed in orientation space, then

and L12 is due to the interaction, in general, between position and orientation. In order for L to give

L1   and   L2   in   the   special   cases   that   the   particle   is   fixed   in   orientation   and   in   position   space

respectively, v and ω must be common factors in L12, so that

so that

For ω = 0, we have the law of inertia. In general, if ω precesses about the spin axis, then v changes,

giving rise to motion on a helix. Because this helix must be very close to a straight line, A must be

And, because of (13), we have finally the matrix differential equations

This is an equation for the “space” components. Now express  ω  as a function of the Euler angles

“body” set of axes, then II will be given by the following similarity transformation

Expressing B and B^(-1) as functions of the Euler angles (see Goldstein, 1968), we can have from

(33) three differential equations for the three Euler angles. After finding them, we will be able to

determine ω as a function of t, and then, from (27), also v as a function of t.

As a first approximation, we can take A = 0 in (25). Then the motion of the particle in position space

will be described as usually, taking the known law of inertia. The motion in orientation space will be

given in the same way as the usual motion of a rigid body with one point fixed.

3. Quantum Mechanics in 7 dimensions

i) Generalized momenta & the Hamiltonian in terms of the Eulerian angles

Let us see what happens with respect to Quantum Mechanics. We will consider motion of a particle

in orientation space, setting L = L2. Considering also a “spherical” particle, we will have

We thus obtain a harmonic solution. And because we demand that ψ(x + 2π) = ± ψ(x), we must have

again k = n, or k = n/2, so that ψ(x + 2π) = - ψ(x) for n odd, while ψ(x + 2π) = ψ(x) for n even.

Now, from eqn. (48), we get

so that the energy E associated with the z-axis is given by

To determine n, we compare this result with the one taken classically if we substitute the (quantized)

pφ (= ± ½ ћ, see above) in (the classical) eqn. (43) (with pψ = 0), which gives 

We thus find that n = ± 1 (or k = ± ½). We see that the energy is the same in either case of the z-spin

we find (setting c ≡ cos(θ/2) and s ≡ sin(θ/2) for brevity)

We will prove that if ψ is a spinor, then so is ψ´ as well. In fact , S is transformed, by the action of a

rotation transformation R, as follows:

where R* is the adjoint of R, with the property that

5. Quantum Mechanics in orientation space

i) Representation of wave functions by spinors

If we want to see the physical significance of the variables X, Y, Z, consider a rotation about the z-

axis. Then, applying formulae (136), expressing the variables x, y, z by their definition (90)

=

x

t

,
     

y

=

t

,
     

z

=

t

,
       

(149)

substituting t also by its definition

=t

tan(q

),2/

       

(150)

and manipulating, we find

=

X

0,      

Y

=

0,      

=
Z q

.       (151)

Now, let us form the eigenvalue equation for the operator 

We take as wave-function a scalar function ψ of (X, Y, Z) and we obtain

ˆ
sz

i



Z

.
       

(152)

i

y = h
e

.       (155)

But   an   orientation   in   orientation   space   is   specified   by   a   quaternion   depending  on   θ/2,   which

therefore varies from 0 to 2π. Thus, θ in (155) varies from 0 to 4π. And since the exponential in

(155) retains its original value if we change the argument in the exponent by 2kπ, we must demand 

4

k=
2

,
       

(156)



where k is an integer. We obtain then for the eigenvalue λ

The eigenfunction (155), for the case k = 0, becomes

or

ie=

,
       

(159)

with θ´ varying from 0 to 2π. After a rotation by θ = 2π, θ´ changes by π and ψ  |  θ´ε (π, 2π) is

therefore the opposite function of ψ │ θ´ ε (0, π). Since the quantity which changes sign by a rotation

by θ = 2π is a spinor, we are led to conclude that the function ψ | θ ε (0, 4π) can be represented by a

spinor function (ψ1, ψ2) | θ ε (0, 2π). In this way we have to represent rather the operator ŝz as a spin

matrix. From now on thus, we will treat the spin as a spin matrix.

We have then

In the same way we can find that for the x and y components we must have the matrices (ħ/2)σx and

i) Generalities

We come now to the Special Theory of Relativity. Because now space and time are united in a four-

dimensional   space-time  (four   position   coordinates),   we   must   take   as   the   orientation   of   a   point

(event) an arbitrary rotation of this four-dimensional space-time. This will depend on six parameters

and will be given by a general Lorentz transformation, consisting of a spatial rotation plus a boost.

Then the corresponding quaternion L will be of the form of the well known quaternion R in ordinary

three-dimensional space, but now expressing a rotation through a complex  angle, say θn  + iα.  We

thus will have

=

L



(204)

The   conclusion   is   that   the   world   will   have   a   total   of   ten   (10)   dimensions:   four   (4)   position

dimensions (defined in space-time) plus six (6) orientation dimensions (defined in quaternion space).

We will denote the 4 position coordinates by xi, defining the matrix (spinor)

while the orientation coordinates are the 3 components of θn  (describing the spatial  rotation) plus

the 3 components of α (describing the boost), defining the quaternion L.

ii) Transformations in position and in orientation space

The transformation law for the position coordinates from one inertial frame to another sorresponding

to a Lorentz spin matrix L (similar in structure to L) will be given by the well known formula

We could find the same things by another way. First of all the transition from one orientation to

another can be performed by a series of successive infinitesimal rotations exp[i(dθ/2)n·σ]. Since we

know that infinitesimal rotations commute, the whole transition can be thought of as resulting from

the rotation exp[i∫(dθ/2)n·σ].Now we demand that the integral of the norm of the integrand in the in

the integral of the exponent  is minimum for the actual path. This is an expression of Maupertuis´

principle. But this integral is obviously minimum when  n  remains constant during the transition.

Then we simply sum up dθ´s and the transition will be a rotation through an angle, say θ, about a

fixed axis, say n, for the actual path. The norm of the exponent for this rotation exp[i(θ/2)n·σ] will

be (θ^2)/4.

Suppose that the rotation through the angle θ takes place in time t. If we divide t to small equal

intervals Δt, and we denote the corresponding angles by Δθ, we now demand that the sum Σ [(Δθ)^2]

is a minimum. This is an expression of Hamilton´s principle. But this happens when all (Δθ)´s are

also equal to one another. Thus the rotation must be performed with constant angular velocity ω =

(Δθ)/(Δt) = θ/t. We now define the action by S = (θ^2)/(4t). Then we have that S = [(θ^2)/(4t^2)]t =

(¼)(ω^2)t. But this must be the time integral of the Lagrangian. Hence we get for the Lagrangian

formula (227). On the other hand the derivative of the action with respect to the coordinate gives the

momentum. Hence formula (228).

7. Relativistic Quantum Mechanics in the 6-dimensional orientation space

We do not expect something essentially different from the casse of Classical Mechanics to occur.

i) Pure spatial rotations

We thus will concentrate to

ii) Pure boosts

Generalize now for the case θn → θn + iα. We will then have the same formulas (227) and (228)

with now ω being complex. Specialize then for the case of pure boost (θ = 0). Then ω = id(αnα)/dt,

that is the angular velocity is imaginary, and so is the spin. But the Lagrangian is real, namely L = 

= -(1/4)(dα/dt)^2. Consider a boost in the z-direction. Then nα = k, ω = idα/dt, s = (½)idα/dt, and

Since   the  spin   is   the   canonical   momentum  conjugate   to  α,   and   considering “motion”   in  the   z-

Thus if we denote by iA the (imaginary) eigenvalue, the eigenvalue equation takes the form

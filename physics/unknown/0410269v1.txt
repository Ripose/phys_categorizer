Abstract 

 
 
A  system  of  two  initially  homogeneous,  physically  real  fields  uniformly  attracted  to  each  other  is 
considered  as  the  simplest  basis  of  the  self-developing  world  structure.  It  is  shown  that,  for  generic 
interaction parameters, the system is unstable against periodic cycles of self-amplified, essentially nonlinear 
squeeze  of  its  extended  part  to  a  small  volume  around  randomly  chosen  centre,  followed  by  the  reverse 
extension. The resulting spatially random pulsation, or “quantum beat”, is observed as (massive) elementary 
particle such as the electron. The property of mass is then universally and consistently defined as temporal 
rate  of  such  dynamically  chaotic  and  essentially  nonlinear  quantum  beat,  without  introduction  of  any 
additional  entities.  The  chaotic  dynamical  structure  of  the  electron  is  based  on  the  qualitatively  new 
phenomena  of  dynamic  redundance  (multivaluedness)  and  entanglement  of  the  interacting  protofields, 
revealed due to the unreduced, universally nonperturbative interaction analysis. The obtained picture can be 
considered  as  complex-dynamical  completion  of  the  “double  solution”  concept  proposed  by  Louis  de 
Broglie. The dynamically emerging wave-particle duality, quantum discreteness, indeterminacy, space, and 
time  lead  to  the equations of special relativity and quantum mechanics, providing their causal explanation 
and  explicit  unification.  The  elementary  particle structure, its intrinsic properties, quantum and relativistic 
behaviour  are  obtained  thus  all  together,  within  the  unified  analysis  of  the  unreduced  interaction  process 
leading to the universal concept of dynamic complexity. The same complex-dynamical process accounts for 
the  universal  gravitation  and  general  relativity,  unifying  it  dynamically  with  the  extended  quantum 
mechanics  and  special  relativity.  The  electromagnetic,  weak,  and  strong  types  of  interaction  between 
particles  also  constitute  integral,  dynamically  unified  parts  of  quantum  beat  processes  inside  elementary 
particles. The classical, dynamically localised behaviour emerges in a closed system as a higher complexity 
level corresponding to formation of elementary bound systems (like atoms).

1. Introduction 

 
 
Physical  and  mathematical  incompleteness  of  existing  interpretations  of  quantum  behaviour  is  a 
well-known fact explicitly emphasised as a basic feature within the standard, or Copenhagen, formulation of 
quantum  mechanics  [1-5].  The  fundamentally  inexplicable,  “mysterious”  character  of  the  essentially 
quantum properties, such as wave-particle duality and quantum indeterminacy, is disputed within a group of 
so-called causal approaches, trying to reduce the number of specific “quantum” postulates to a general level 
of  classical  physics  [4].  Note,  however,  that  those  approaches  do  not  include  any  detailed  study  on  the 
physical structure of elementary particles as such, simply postulating its either point-like or (linear) wave-
like model (or a “mysterious” combination of both). Such separation between “structure” and its “function” 
(i. e. properly “quantum” behaviour of the particle) cannot be correct, since both belong to the same level 
of  dynamics  of  the  same  physical  system,  but  it  remains  a  forced  simplification  within  the  traditional, 
“linear”  science  approach  which  has  the  well-known  fundamental  difficulties  in  description  of  the 
unreduced, essentially nonlinear structure-formation processes. 
 
The  first  serious  attempt  to  include  the  dynamically  changing  particle  structure  and  its  causally 
understood  quantum  behaviour  into  the  same  picture  was  realised  by  Louis  de  Broglie  within  his 
intrinsically  nonlinear  “wave  mechanics”  [6-10].  It  is  proposed in the form of the “double solution” [7-9] 
further  amplified  by  the  “thermodynamics  of  the  isolated  particle”  [10]  and  trying  to  unify  formal 
representations  of  the  undulatory  and  corpuscular  aspects  of  quantum  behaviour  into  a  unique,  explicitly 
presented  and  reality-based  solution,  which  inevitably  includes  the  essential  clarification  of  the  physical 
particle  structure.*)  However,  despite  a  number  of  fundamentally  important  results  obtained  within  the 
unifying logic of the original double solution concept, including the rarely reproduced detailed derivation of 
the  standard expression for the de Broglie wavelength [6], de Broglie's project in the whole has not been 
completed. 
 
In this paper we present an independent, first-principles analysis of complex (chaotic) dynamics of a 
system of two a priori homogeneous physical fields, or protofields, attracted to each other and chosen as 
the simplest possible basis of the emerging world structure. We show that the explicitly obtained solution of 
a new, intrinsically complete type naturally unifies, simply due to its unreduced (nonperturbative) character, 
all  the  expected  properties  of  de  Broglie's  double  solution  and  thus  provides  the  consistent  solution  of 
“quantum  mysteries”.  This  is  related  to  the  qualitatively  new  phenomenon  of  dynamically  redundant 
(multivalued)  entanglement  of  interacting  entities  that  naturally  emerges  within  the  proposed  universally 

                                                
*)  In  this  respect,  the  double  solution  should  be  clearly  distinguished  from  its  reduced,  schematic  version  first  proposed  by 
Louis  de  Broglie  himself  under  the  name  of  “pilot-wave  interpretation”,  reintroduced  much  later  by  Bohm  [11],  further 
developed  by  his  followers  [4,12,13],  and  now  often  presented  as  the  unique  version  of  “causal  de  Broglie-Bohm  approach” 
(see also refs. [14,15]). 

 

 

nonperturbative  analysis  (section  2)  and  constitutes  the  basis  of  the  recently  advanced,  reality-based 
concept  of  dynamic  complexity  in  any  nontrivial  system  with  interaction  [14-17].  The  explicitly  creative, 
structure-forming  character  of  the  obtained  solution  automatically  provides  the  internal physical structure 
of the electron and other emerging elementary particles, each massive particle being explicitly obtained thus 
as  a  chaotic  (dynamically  multivalued)  interaction  process  that  takes  the  form  of  spatially  chaotic,  highly 
nonlinear pulsation, or quantum beat [14-16], developing in an a priori totally deterministic (and ultimately 
simple) system of coupled protofields (section 3). 
 
Due  to  the  absolute  universality  of  the  analysis  and  the  obtained  general  solution,  the  specific 
“quantum”  mysteries  are  causally  resolved  within  the  same  approach  that  provides  complex-dynamical 
completion of the canonical description of higher-level, classical phenomena emerging in a natural hierarchy 
of  further  interaction  development  between  the  explicitly  obtained  entities  of  the  preceding  (lower) 
complexity levels, which is important for unification of science around the causally complete understanding 
of unreduced diversity of the complex world dynamics [14]. Thus, the unreduced, dynamically multivalued 
dynamics  of  the  interacting  elementary  particles  gives  rise  to  the  genuine  quantum  chaos  and  causal 
quantum  measurement  phenomena,  as  well  as  to  the  classical  (permanently  localised)  type  of  behaviour 
(section  7)  dynamically  emerging  in  a  closed  quantum  system  as  the  next  (higher)  level  of  unreduced 
dynamic  complexity,  in  the  form  of  the  simplest  bound  system  (like  atoms)  [14-17].  The  number  and 
properties  of  the  “four  fundamental  forces”  of  interaction  between  particles  also  naturally  emerge  in  the 
described  world  configuration  of  two  coupled  protofields  (section  6),  where  all  the  four  forces  are 
intrinsically, dynamically unified within quantum beat processes (i. e. “within” elementary particles). 
Moreover, the quantum beat pulsation provides not only the causally specified internal structure of 
 
elementary particles, but also physically real and “emerging” (rigorously derived) space and time, in direct 
relation  to  the  global  particle  motion,  which  leads  to  the  causally  derived,  totally  dynamic,  and  unified 
understanding of the conventional “relativistic” relations between space, time, motion, mass, energy, other 
properties, and their genuine physical meaning in terms of the underlying complex (multivalued) dynamics 
(section 4). One obtains, in that way, the intrinsic, dynamic unification between causally extended versions 
of  quantum  mechanics  and  relativity  (sections  4,  5),  persistently  missing  in  the  conventional,  dynamically 
single-valued (unitary) theory. This unification includes also the irreducibly quantum origin of gravity and 
causally extended “general relativity”, representing but particular aspects of the holistic complex dynamics 
of interacting particle-processes within the single system of two interacting protofields (section 6). 
It  becomes  clear  that  such  unified,  totally  causal  (realistic)  solution  of  the  conventional  quantum 
 
(and other) “mysteries” is based essentially on the proposed unreduced, universally nonperturbative analysis 
of  any  interaction  process  revealing  the  phenomenon  of  dynamic  multivaluedness  and  entanglement, 
whereas the conventional theory always simplifies the underlying system interaction by using one or another 
version  of  perturbation  theory,  which  leads  inevitably  to  a  fatally  reduced,  dynamically  single-valued 
“model” of reality that cannot reproduce its observed properties without dramatic contradictions, emerging 
in  the  form  of  “inexplicable”,  postulated  mysteries  (and  entities)  and  persistent,  “irresolvable”  problems. 
Below  we  briefly  specify  the  difference  between  these  two  pictures  (reduced  and  unreduced)  of  world 
dynamics,  starting  from  the  dynamical  structure  of  electron  and  other  elementary  particles  that  emerge 
together with their quantum and relativistic behaviour, mass-energy and other intrinsic properties.

2. Complex dynamics of interaction between two protofields: 
dynamic reduction, entanglement, and causal randomness 

 
 
Consider  a  system  of  two  physically  real  and  initially  homogeneous  protofields,  or  media,  one  of 
them  being  associated  by  its  physical  quality  with  eventually  emerging  electromagnetic  (e/m)  phenomena 
and  the  other  with  gravitational  effects,  and  let  us  analyse  the  results  of  their  attractive  interaction,  or 
coupling,  trying  to  avoid  any  perturbative  reduction  and  additional  assumption.  It  is  implied  that  the 
protofields may constitute the fundamental — and the simplest possible — physical basis of the explicitly 
emerging  world  structure,  if  we  can  show  how  all  the  observed  features  of  the  latter,  starting  from  the 
elementary  particles,  progressively  and  naturally  form  in  course  of  autonomous,  or  “spontaneous”, 
development of the unreduced interaction process. Indeed, a system of only two a priori homogeneous and 
homogeneously interacting entities constitutes the simplest possible physical basis of a viable world, since a 
still  simpler  configuration  without  interaction  cannot  provide  any  system  development  (structure 
emergence), while attribution of a particular physical nature to the e/m and gravitational protofields forms 
the  indispensable  minimum  of  (justified)  “postulates”  of  the  theory.  It  is  also  evident  that  the  free 
protofields,  in  their  structureless  initial  state,  actually  provide  the  causal,  non-contradictory  prototype  of 
“ether”, since they cannot be observed as such from the inside of the emerging world, but remain physically 
real (which is confirmed by observability of their perturbations, resulting from interaction).

development.  Such  expression  of  the  system  configuration  in  terms  of  dynamical  “eigen-modes”  (or 
“elements”)  of  free  components  should  always  be  possible,  even  for  the  formally  “nonlinear”  protofields,

participating scales (or else one should start with a similar analysis of unknown lower-level dynamics).

The  described  equivalent  problem  transformation  is  known  as  the  standard  “optical  potential 
method” [19] in which, however, it is invariably followed by a perturbative reduction of the EP expression, 
eqs.  (8),  eliminating  the  “nonintegrable”  nonlinear  dependence  on  the  unknown  eigen-solutions,  but 
simultaneously “killing” all the intrinsic dynamic complexity it hides. Indeed, as shown below (see also refs. 
[14-18]),  in  its  unreduced  form  this  self-consistent  EP  dependence  on  the  eigen-solutions  to  be  found 
represents the essential, dynamic nonlinearity of a generic, often a priori “linear” interaction process, in the 
form  of  dynamically  emerging  feedback  loops  of  interaction,  which  leads  to  a  dramatic  increase  of  the 
number of solutions, each of them being “complete” in the ordinary sense and thus incompatible with any 
other,  equally  real,  solution.  This  phenomenon  of  dynamic  redundance,  or  multivaluedness,  of  the 
unreduced problem solution can be demonstrated directly, by counting the number of eigen-solutions of eq. 
(7) determined by the highest power of the eigenvalue η in the corresponding characteristic equation. If 
eN  
gN   are  the  numbers  of  eigen-modes  (or  “elements”)  for  the  free  e/m  and  gravitational  protofields 
and 
respectively (normally

Whereas other, equivalent ways of estimation of the number of solutions of eq. (7) only confirm this 
result  and  show  that  all  the  solutions  obtained  for  generic  interaction  parameters  are  real  (not  spurious) 
[14-18], there is a still more transparent, physical support for common emergence of dynamic redundance. 
It comes from the fact that within the unreduced interaction process every mode of each partner interacts,

contact of each element of an interacting entity with only one element of another interaction partner, so that 
all  those  redundant,  real  solutions  are  lost,  except  the  single,  trivial  one,  which  explains  the  dramatic 
reduction of reality within the conventional theory, crudely simplifying the interaction result and leading, in 
particular,  to  the  inexplicable  “mysteries”  of  the  standard,  unitary  quantum  mechanics,  within  any  its 
speculative “interpretation” (we continue to specify this conclusion below). 
We  call  each  of  the  complete,  and  therefore  mutually  incompatible,  solutions  of  the  unreduced 
 
effective  problem  formulation,  eqs. (7)-(11), realisation of the system and shall enumerate realisations by 
index  r  (
).  For  the  considered  case  of  interacting,  initially  homogeneous  protofields  each 
regular  realisation  is  represented  by  a  dynamically  auto-squeezed,  or  (physically)  “reduced”  state  of  the 
fields concentrated around thus emerging centre of reduction, or physical “space point” (it represents also

Due  to  the  nonperturbative,  effectively  nonlinear  dependence  of  the  unreduced  solution  on  the  problem 
eigen-solutions  (in  the  terms  of  the  inner  sum  in  eq.  (13)),  the  system  density  in  the  r-th  realisation  will

well in the previously homogeneous system configuration just around the same preferred physical “point”, 
rη η=

, so that both these aspects of the dynamic reduction (collapse) of the system form the single, self-
sustained process, in agreement with the effective form of the existence equation, eq. (7). The second, EP 
aspect  of  the  nonlinear  reduction  directly  follows  from  the nonperturbative EP expression, eq. (8), which

It  is  important  here  that  the  unreduced  EP  has  the  same  resonant,  nonlinear  dependence  on  the  eigen-
solutions as the state-function of eq. (13), and therefore will dynamically form the potential well just around 
the  same  centre  of  localisation  (which  is  described  mathematically  by  the  same  resonant  and  cutting 
structures in eq. (14)) [14-17].

The dynamic auto-squeeze (reduction) process of a system towards one of its realisations from the 
initial  structureless  state  provides  the  universal  mechanism  of  any  structure  formation  [14],  considerably 
extending  the  conventional  “self-organisation”  concept  (based  on  the  same  single-valued,  perturbative 
description  as  the  canonical  “linear”  science  and  thus  actually  needing  artificial  insertion  of  the  “self-
organised”  structure  into  the  main  equations  supposed  to  “naturally  produce”  it).  The  dynamic  reduction 
process  shows  how  the  system  actually,  physically  “produces”  and  “takes”  one  of  its  incompatible 
realisations by following a dynamically self-amplifying, catastrophic (avalanche-type) phase of the (generic) 
interaction  process  that  possesses  thus  a  permanent,  omnipresent  instability  driven  by  the  unceasingly 
forming  feedback  loops  of  the  unreduced  interaction.  This  universal  dynamic  instability  of  an  “ordinary” 
interaction  has  a  very  transparent  physical  representation  completing  the  equally  simple  interpretation  of 
dynamic  redundance  described  above  and  confirming  the  rigorous  analysis  of  eqs.  (13)-(14).  Indeed,  it is 
quite clear that the more is the concentration of each protofield around certain locality (starting from some 
initial,  in  principle  infinitesimal,  fluctuation),  the  more  is  their  mutual  attraction  at  that  locality  yet 
increasing field concentration, etc. Correspondingly, the conventional, perturbative analysis always applied 
within  the  canonical,  unitary  theory  can  be  described  as  incorrect  cutting  of  those  emerging  interaction 
loops,  which  leads  to  artificial  interruption  of  dynamic  instability  and  the  related  structure  formation, 
accompanied by (unjustified) reduction of the dynamic multivaluedness of that process to only one, slightly 
inhomogeneous  solution-realisation.  Therefore  it  is  only  the  unreduced,  dynamically  multivalued  and 
interaction-driven  entanglement  between  the  interacting  protofields,  described  by  the  nonperturbative  EP 
formalism,  eqs.  (7)-(14),  that  provides  the  adequate  picture  of  the  internal  dynamical  structure  of  the 
electron  and  other  (massive)  elementary  particles,  where  the  above  dynamical  squeeze  (reduction)  of  the 
protofields accounts for the “corpuscular”, localised state formation within the total field-particle dynamics 
(further details are considered below). 
 
It  is  clear  also  that  the  described  dynamic,  self-sustained  structure  formation  through  the 
autonomous  interaction  feedback  development  constitutes  the  property  of  real,  and  universally  defined, 
nonlinearity  of  any  generic  system  with  interaction  that  is  not  explicitly  inserted  into  the  initial  problem 
formulation,  as  it  is  always  done  in  the  conventional,  single-valued  imitations  of  a  loosely  understood 
“nonlinearity”  (which  is  introduced  “heuristically”,  in  the  form  of  “curved”,  or  “nonlinear”,  functional 
dependencies, including artificially inserted “recursive”, self-acting equation terms, “rugged landscapes” in 
abstract  “spaces”,  numerically  obtained  “attractors”,  etc.).  We  call  the  unreduced,  dynamically  emerging 
(interaction-driven) and universal “self-action” property of dynamical systems, eqs. (7)-(11), the essential, 
or  dynamic,  nonlinearity  [14]  and  state  that  any  other  meaning  of  nonlinearity  inevitably  suffers  from 
incompleteness and ambiguity. The essential nonlinearity provides, in the case of protofield interaction, the 
causally complete version of that “hidden”, intrinsic nonlinearity of an externally “linear” interaction process 
(cf.  eq.  (1))  which  is  indispensable  for  the  consistent  understanding  of  quantum  mechanics,  as  it  was 
repeatedly emphasised by Louis de Broglie [9] (we further specify this statement below). We have shown 
above  that  the  same  unreduced  interaction  process  that  determines  the  essential  nonlinearity  of  any  real 
system is at the origin of dynamic multivaluedness of its emerging realisations. Therefore any dynamically 
single-valued,  effectively  one-dimensional  (or  “separable”)  description of the conventional analysis can be 
characterised as essentially linear one, irrespective of the externally “curved” shape of an “exact” solution 
(such as the canonical soliton) or formally postulated system “stochasticity”, which is always equivalent to a 
dynamically single-valued projection of the real system dynamics.

Since  the  system  has  many  equally  possible  realisations  (due  to  the  essential  nonlinearity  of  the 
unreduced  interaction  process),  and  the  driving  interaction  never  stops  its  action,  any  system  realisation 
cannot be stable and the system will start leaving it, within the same interaction process, immediately after 
the end of the corresponding reduction phase. Indeed, each of the protofields in their squeezed state within 
a given (currently occupied) realisation continues to interact with the surrounding, “non-squeezed” portions 
of  its  interaction  partner  (the  other  protofield).  In  the  stage  of  catastrophic  reduction  these  “sideways” 
interactions  are  dynamically  suppressed  by  the  main  self-amplifying  tendency,  but  after  the  latter  has 
produced  the  maximum  possible  protofield  compression  (the  physically  real  protofields  have  a  finite 
compressibility) and stopped, the “main”, dynamically self-amplifying tendency is reversed and the system 
catastrophically  extends  itself,  “drawn  out”  by  the  surrounding  “flat”  portions  of  the  protofields.  After 
having  attained  the  completely  extended,  quasi-free  state,  the  local  configuration  of  the  interacting 
protofields will evidently repeat the squeeze/reduction phase, but towards a new “point”-realisation (centre 
of reduction) “chosen” by the system in the causally random fashion among the adjacent multiple, equally 
possible realisations. In this way, the essential nonlinearity (dynamic instability) in the a priori homogeneous 
system of interacting protofields leads to “spontaneous” (purely dynamic) emergence of a highly nonlinear 
“clock-work”, producing unceasing series of cycles of alternating local protofield squeeze (reduction) and 
extension.  This  fundamental,  naturally  “quantized”  process  of  essentially  nonlinear  and  spatially  chaotic 
pulsation, emerging eventually around as many locations as there are “elementary particles” in the coupled 
protofield  universe,  is  called  quantum  beat  [14-16]  and  provides  the  world  with  the  physically  real, 
emerging entities of time and space that were not present at all in the starting existence equation, eq. (1). 
Quantum  beat  constitutes  also  the  essence  of  the  internal  dynamical  structure  of  the  electron  and  other 
massive elementary particles, and we continue to specify it below. 
 
The  reality  of  that  complex  dynamical  structure  of  the  externally  simple  configuration  of  two 
interacting  protofields  is  supported  by  the  dynamically  squeezed,  highly  inhomogeneous  configuration  of 
the unreduced, nonperturbative solution for each “regular” system realisation considered above, eqs. (13)-
(14),  but  also  by  the  opposite,  quasi-homogeneous  (quasi-free)  structure  of  the  exceptional,  transitional 
state/realisation  between  the  regular  realisations  that  corresponds  to  the  extension  phase  of  the  quantum 
beat process and is explicitly given by the same nonperturbative version of the EP formalism. Indeed, it is 
easy  to  see  that  the  effective  existence  equation,  eqs.  (7)-(8), always accepts one and only one particular 
solution-realisation  with  quasi-homogeneously  distributed  density  that  corresponds  to  a  really  weak 
00V ξ , in eq. (8a). For this particular realisation, the EP in eq.

In that way the intermediate (or “main”) realisation of the system with interaction reveals the causal 
 
meaning  of  the  canonical,  perturbative  solution  and  analysis  of  the  same  system:  the  extended  version  of 
“perturbative”  solution/realisation  exists  and  describes  precisely  the  quasi-free  intermediate  system  state-

nonperturbative, internally entangled (“nonseparable”) realisations which are equally real and thus taken (in 
a  causally  random  order)  by  the  system,  always  passing  between  them  through  the  “connecting”,  
intermediate  realisation.  The  major  deficiency  of  the  perturbative  analysis  is  that,  getting  into  the  trap  of 
external  “self-consistency”  of  the  “main”  realisation  (expressing  its  relative,  local  independence,  or 
“completeness”),  it  totally  ignores  all  the  “regular”  system  realisations,  representing  just  the  most 
pronounced,  dynamically  entangled  result  of  the  whole  interaction  process as such (see also below), and 
takes into account a simplified version of only one, very special realisation, representing in reality only the 
dynamically  averaged  density  of  (highly  irregular)  transitions  between  the  “essential”,  always  dynamically 
redundant  results  of  interaction.  It  is  clear,  in  particular,  that  the  latter  correspond  to  the  “corpuscular”, 
dynamically  localised  state  of  the  thus  emerging  elementary  field-particle,  whereas  the  intermediate 
realisation  provides  the  causal,  realistic  version  of  the  (now)  dynamically  related  and  probabilistic 
“wavefunction” (see sections 3, 5 for further details), which reveals also the fundamental, irreducible origin 
of the postulated “quantum mysteries” in the canonical, dynamically single-valued (unitary) theory. We can 
say  also  that  any  version  of  the  canonical  “perturbation  expansion”  always  diverges  because  the  system 
possesses  as  if  the  “singularity”  of  dynamical  “branch  point”  (giving  many  incompatible  realisations) 
everywhere within its causally complete evolution. 
 
The dynamic redundance phenomenon revealed above means that the genuine (i. e. really complete) 
general  solution  of  a  problem,  describing  the  unreduced,  complex-dynamical  interaction  process,  is 
obtained at the level of observable system property, generalised density (

As in many cases the elementary realisations are not individually resolved in actual measurements and, being 
inhomogeneously distributed, appear in dense groups, or dynamic “tendencies”, containing various numbers

However,  the  dynamically  probabilistic  sum  of  eq.  (15)  and  the  associated  causally  deduced  probability 
values,  eqs.  (16),  preserve  their  meaning  also  for  single,  isolated  events  emerging  in  the  real  time  of 
observation/measurement (and thus together with the causally specified time itself, see below). 
Note  that  the  causally  complete  picture  of  dynamically  redundant  evolution  of  any  “quantum” 
 
system means that it is basically nonunitary, which can be physically (and mathematically) specified now as 
its  particular  structure  in  the  form  of  qualitatively  nonuniform  (“jump-like”)  and  dynamically  chaotic 
sequence of discrete events. This intrinsic nonunitarity can be hidden in the canonical “quantum postulates” 
of the standard, formally unitary description because the individual inhomogeneous, chaotic “steps” of the 
quantum  beat  dynamics,  forming  the  very  first  “level  of  complexity”  (dynamical  structure)  of  the  world, 
cannot  be  resolved  in  detail  in  principle,  which may leave an impression of a “smooth”, unitary evolution 
within the single-valued dynamics of a unique, “averaged” system realisation (unitarity is thus equivalent to 
single-valuedness  and  essential  linearity).  However,  the  underlying  real,  nonunitary  basis  of  the  system 
dynamics inevitably leaves its “harmful” traces on the artificially smoothened façade of the canonical theory 
in  the  form  of  persistent  “unsolvable”  problems  and  “mysteries”  in  the  observed  quantum  behaviour,  like 
the  origin  of  unceasingly  flowing,  irreversible  time,  irreducible  unpredictability  and  discreteness,  and 
various manifestations of duality (or “complementarity”). 
 

3. Complex-dynamical structure of the electron: 
quantum beat duality, causal wavefunction, fractal entanglement, and spin 

 
 
As shown above, the interaction partners (protofields) temporally return, during each system jump 
between  two  successive  regular  (localised)  realisations,  to  a  quasi-free  state  qualitatively  close  to  their 
(hypothetical)  “primordial”  state  of  “ether”  before  the  beginning  of  the  interaction  process.  Since  the 
reduction  centres  form  a  causally  random sequence (because of the dynamic redundance phenomenon), it 
follows  that  the  intermediate  realisation  is  a  “uniformly  chaotic”,  rather  then  “smoothly  homogeneous” 
state. As shown in more detail below (see also [14,16]), this highly irregular, unstable intermediate state of 
a system with interaction, dynamically “connecting” all regular realisations into a single structure-process, 
provides the causal, physically real extension of the canonical wavefunction, only formally introduced in the 
conventional  quantum  mechanics,  but  now  endowed  with  the  realistic,  physically  complete  interpretation 
and generalised to any interaction process. It is easy to see that the contradictory, mysteriously probabilistic 
and  dualistic  wavefunction  properties,  killing  any  attempt  of  its  realistic  interpretation  within  any 
dynamically  single-valued  theory,  are  due  to  the  causally  probabilistic  structure  of  the  intermediate 
realisation  and  its  permanent  dynamic  transformation  into  the  regular,  “normal”  system  realisations 
(corpuscular states of the field-particle). 
 

 

12 

 
In  particular,  the  intermediate  realisation  plays  the  role  of  a  dynamically  emerging  “surface”  (or 
“time moment”) of boundary (or initial) conditions, and the elementary matching of the state-functions for 
regular  realisations,  eqs.  (10)-(11),  or  (13),  to  that  of  the  quasi-free  state  of  the  intermediate  realisation 
(wavefunction) confirms the above expressions for regular realisation probabilities rα , eqs. (16), where the 
rN )  and  whole-space  ( Nℜ )  integrals  of  the 
realisation  numbers  are  proportional  respectively  to  local  (
observed  system  density  (wavefunction  squared  modulus),  which  can  be  understood  as  the  causal 
substantiation  and  extension  of  the  canonical  “Born's  probability  rule”  [14-16].  This  postulate  of  the 
canonical theory, contributing to its unsolvable “puzzles”, becomes a physically transparent consequence of 
the complex quantum beat dynamics following from the above equations: the wave field of the intermediate 
realisation,  possessing  a  delocalised  structure  that  necessarily  spans  all  possible  localised,  regular  system 
realisations it directly produces, will evidently collapse to a corpuscular state with higher probability there 
where  it  has  higher  (average)  density  and  vice  versa,  while  all  its  local  density  variations  can  only  be 
produced  at  each  other's  expense  and  should  therefore  mutually  compensate,  which  is  expressed  as 
wavefunction squared modulus “normalisation to probability 1”. 
We see that the protofield interaction process (but also any unreduced interaction at a higher level 
 
of  world  dynamics)  has  the  dynamically  complex  internal  structure  (in  a  well-specified  sense),  where  the 
phases  of  strong  interaction  and  physical  entanglement  within  each  regular  realisation  alternate  with 
transitional  periods  of  weak  interaction  of  quasi-free  partners  within  the  intermediate  realisation,  without 
any artificial insertion of this nonlinear pulsation in the initial problem formulation. The actually perceived 
“magnitude” of interaction is usually the natural, dynamical average between all realisations and especially 
those two qualitatively different, always present components of “strong” and “weak” interaction. In terms 
of the above causally extended wavefunction, this intrinsic duality of complex dynamics takes the form of 
“mysterious”  (and  now  completely  understood)  combination  of  the  “quasi-free”  and  therefore  basically 
“linear” state of the wavefunction (obeying, in particular, the derived linear Schrödinger equation [14]) with 
its  highly  nonlinear  behaviour  (though  hidden  in  the  canonical  postulates)  as  far  as  “measurement”, 
corpuscular, and “quantum-transition” properties of the same objects are involved (cf. ref. [9]). 
 
In  that  way  we  have  already  revealed  three  closely  related  aspects  of  the  same,  now  causally 
explained,  property  of  “wave-particle  duality”:  (i)  the  unceasing,  physically  real,  and  totally  internal 
transformation between the well-defined squeezed and delocalised states of the elementary field-particle, (ii) 
the  corresponding  alternation  of  the  “strong”  (“nonperturbative”)  and  “weak”  (quasi-“perturbative”) 
interaction  regimes  in  the  underlying  coupled  protofield  system,  and  (iii)  combination  of  the  (alternating) 
“linear” and “nonlinear” types of the field-particle behaviour. We see now that all of them are but particular 
manifestations of the intrinsic duality of complex dynamics of any unreduced interaction process, explaining 
the fundamental meaning of the conventional Bohr's “complementarity”, which is intuitively “felt” as a more 
general basis behind the observed particular manifestations of quantum weirdness. 
The  described  unreduced  dynamic  complexity  of  the  natural,  dynamically  multivalued  interaction 
 
processes  (quantum  beat  for  the  coupled  protofield  system)  can  be  further  specified  within  a  universally 
applicable and totally consistent measure of complexity by any growing function of the number of system 
realisations (or the rate of their change) equal to zero for only one realisation [14] (see ref. [16] and below 
for further details). Being expressed by various measurable quantities, such as energy [14,16], thus defined 
dynamic  complexity  is  directly  related  to  the  above  properties  of  dynamic  redundance  and  causal 
randomness,  which  means  that  the  unreduced  complexity  is  actually  a  synonym  of  the  causally  extended 
notion  of  dynamical  chaos,  characterising  the  inseparable  mixture  of  regularity  of  each  individual

realisation  and  dynamic  randomness  of the order of their natural emergence in the form of physically real 
space structure. 
Another closely related feature of the unreduced complexity of natural interaction processes is the 
 
autonomous dynamic entanglement of interacting entities within any regular realisation and their transient 
disentanglement  during  system  transitions  between  realisations  (through  the  phase  of  intermediate 
realisation,  or  causal  wavefunction).  The  physically  real  dynamic  entanglement  is  described  by  sums  of 
weighted,  “interwoven”  products  of  functions  of  q  and  ξ  in  the  expressions,  eqs.  (10)-(11),  (13),  for  the 
r qΨ ξ .  Moreover,  the  entanglement  continues,  by  the  same 
compound  system  state-function, 
fundamental mechanism, at ever smaller scales related to the current, explicitly considered scale through the 
niη }, of the “auxiliary” system of equations, eqs. (9). We shall not explicitly provide 
solutions, {
here  the  application  of  the  same  analysis  to  that  hierarchy  of  scales  described  by  the  corresponding 
hierarchy  of  equations  and  revealing  the  complex-dynamical,  causally  probabilistic  extension  of  fractal 
(the details can be found in ref. [14]), also because in the case of interacting protofields those smaller scales 
are directly unobservable from within this world, even though their existence is necessary for the formation 
of  the  smallest  observable  structures,  the  elementary  field-particles.  It  is  important  that  the  fractal, 
“infinitely  fine”  dynamic  entanglement  of  the  interacting  e/m  and  gravitational  “degrees  of  freedom” 
constitutes the real, physically (and therefore also mathematically) “inseparable” structure within the core 
of  the  elementary  field-particle  (like  the  electron)  in  its  corpuscular,  dynamically  squeezed  state,  as  it  is 
described  by  eqs.  (13),  (14).  Another  fundamentally  important  role  of  the  fractal  entanglement  of 
interacting  entities  is  that  it  determines  the  unavoidable  dynamic  instability  of  any  realisation,  even  in  the 
total absence of additional, “noisy” perturbations, so that each localised, corpuscular phase (realisation) of 
the  field-particle  should  necessary  be  transformed  into  its  extended  (undulatory)  state  in  the  intermediate 
realisation, and vice versa. The process of disentanglement, or extension, of interaction partners up to their 
transient  quasi-free  state  in  the  intermediate  realisation  is  opposite  to  the  dynamic  entanglement,  or 
reduction. It has already been described above and corresponds to temporary quasi-perturbative separation 
of the effective existence equation, eq. (7), for that particular realisation. 
 
Note  that  the  revealed  dynamic  redundance  and  entanglement  properties  actually  form  two 
inseparable  aspects  of  the  same  unreduced  interaction  complexity:  redundance  of  the  interaction  results 
means  that  the  unreduced  entanglement/combination  of  interacting  entities  has  the  redundant  number  of 
equally real versions (see eq. (12) and its discussion above), which leads to their unceasing causally random 
change within the emerging quantum beat process. Correspondingly, none of the related manifestations of 
the unreduced dynamic complexity can be obtained within its single-valued conventional imitations (see ref. 
[14]  for  more  details),  always  using  perturbation  expansions  that  inevitably  kill,  as  we  have  seen,  the 
essential links in the natural interaction development (which does not prevent one from a purely empirical, 
or numerical, observation/description of the resulting properties that remain, however, unexplained in their 
fundamental  origin).  Therefore  the  true  reason  for  the  persistently  “mysterious”  character  of  “quantum-
mechanical” duality, uncertainty and other related properties within the conventional approaches, including 
their  latest,  always  axiomatic  “interpretations”  (like  e.  g.  “quantum  histories”),  is  their  invariably  single-
valued,  perturbative,  “anti-interactional”  and  purely  abstract  character  neglecting  the  unreduced  dynamic 
complexity  of  real  interactions  and  its  universal,  irreducible,  and  therefore  omnipresent  manifestations 
(dynamic randomness, entanglement, duality, etc.). In particular, the formal, typically mysterious “quantum 
entanglement”  of  the  abstract  “state  vectors”  often  evoked  in  the  conventional  quantum  mechanics,  and 
especially  recently  in  relation  to  “quantum  computers”,  is  none  other  than  the  unitary,  mechanistically 

 

14 

simplified imitation of the physically real, complex-dynamical entanglement described above, which explains 
the  persistence  of  the  mystery  and  the  related  fundamental  deficiency  of  the  concept  of  unitary  quantum 
computation (see ref. [14] for more details and references). 
 
We  cannot  avoid  mentioning  here  another  irreducible  feature  of  the  complex  reduction-extension 
dynamics of the interacting protofields giving rise to the causal understanding of the universal property of 
spin  of  the  emerging  elementary  particle  and  providing  further  refinement  of  the  fractal  dynamic 
entanglement  process  (a  more  detailed  analysis  is  proposed  in  ref.  [14]).  The  above  picture  of  the 
dynamical, physically real interlacement of the protofields in the process of squeeze to a very small volume 
implies  already  a  clear  image  of  the  necessary  rotational  component  of  motion  of  the  fields  around  each 
reduction centre. This tentative image can be provided with a fundamental substantiation if we note that the 
self-sustained  squeeze  of  an  extended  protofield  with  a  finite  compressibility  to  a  point-like  state  should 
inevitably result in the shear instability within the field leading to its vortex-like motion towards the centre 
of  reduction.  The  phenomenon  is  generally  similar to the (turbulent) forced passage of a liquid through a 
small hole, but in our case we have its much more “nonlinear”, self-amplified version, while the unique role 
of  the  complex  (unreduced)  field-particle  dynamics  consists  in  “automatic”,  unceasing  creation  of  a 
sequence of those “small holes” (any canonical, unitary theory would predict for this case a single, more or 
less homogeneous “fall” of one of the protofields onto another). It is this highly nonuniform and internally 
irregular  vortex  motion  of  the  elementary  field-particle  in  course  of  each  reduction  (and  the  following 
extension)  which  provides  both  causal,  universal  understanding  of  the  property  of  spin  and  further 
refinement  of  the  process  of  dynamic  entanglement  of  the  interacting  (physical)  protofields,  giving  the 
adequate picture of the dynamic “internal structure”, and thus physical essence, of the elementary particle 
as such, the electron being its simplest, “canonical” species. Note, however, that as the EP magnitude can 
be  estimated  by  the  particle  mass,  the  relatively  light  particles,  such  as  electron  and  other  leptons,  are 
characterised by a weak degree of direct protofield “mixture”, remaining “wandering” nonlinear vortices, or 
virtual solitons, of the e/m protofield driven by attraction to the hidden gravitational protofield, whereas the 
heavier,  hadronic  particles  correspond  to  higher  EP  magnitudes  and  realise  a  much  more  close,  direct 
protofield entanglement (see refs. [14,16] for more details). 
 

4. Causal relativity of complex elementary particle dynamics 

 
Consider the elementary field-particle, such as electron, remaining globally at rest. According to the 
 
previous analysis (sections 2, 3) [14-16], it is represented by the unceasing, intrinsically random process of 
quantum  beat  in  the  system  of  coupled  e/m  and  gravitational  protofields/media,  equivalent  to  spatially 
chaotic  wandering  of  the  emerging  virtual  soliton.  We  can  state  now  that  this  unceasing  chaotic  motion 
appears  in  observations  as  the  universally  determined  property  of  inertia  of  the  elementary  particle  (and 
eventually,  of  macroscopic  bodies  composed  from  such  particles)  measured  by  the  field-particle  mass, 
which  is  causally  equivalent  to  the  rest  energy  appearing  in  the  form  of chaotic wandering of the virtual 
soliton (or system realisation change). Indeed, it is clear that any attempt to change the dynamical state of 
the  field-particle  will  meet an effective resistance due to the already existing internal, “thermal” (chaotic) 
motion of the virtual soliton, which is generally similar to resistance to compression of a gas consisting in 
this case of only one “molecule” that possesses, however, perfectly chaotic dynamics and therefore tries to 
“take  all  the  accessible  volume”  (of  system  realisations).  Such  definition  of  inertial  mass  as  an  emergent, 
dynamical property is possible only due to the causally derived self-sustained character of the quantum beat 

 

15 

process and its purely dynamic chaoticity, obtained in the form of dynamic multivaluedness (redundance) of 
the protofield interaction process. 
In  that  way,  we  are  able to extend the concept of the “variable mass” of a particle in de Broglie's 
 
“hidden  thermodynamics”  [10]  because  we  can  replace  additional  chaotic  perturbations  of  the  regular, 
“inherent” particle motion and mass coming from the external “hidden thermostat” (“subquantum medium”) 
in the original de Broglie's picture by the intrinsic, purely dynamic chaoticity emerging in the process of a 
priory  totally  regular  (and  closed)  protofield  interaction  system  and  determining  the  whole  field-particle 
dynamics.  The  same  refers  to  other  reappearing  attempts  to  describe  inertia  as  a  result  of  formally 
introduced  external  influences,  such  as  “vacuum  fluctuations”  [20]  or  omnipresent  field/particles  (“Higgs 
bosons”), on an initially massless “particle” or “charge” of a postulated, but poorly specified physical origin, 
which is actually equivalent to a considerably simplified, but externally, terminologically “updated” version 
of the original de Broglie's picture [9-10]. 
 
The  proposed  universal,  physically  transparent  and  fundamentally  substantiated  interpretation  of 
inertia/energy  should  now  be  provided  with  an  equally  consistent  mathematical  expression.  In  order  to 
properly account for the unreduced complexity of the quantum beat dynamics, the intrinsic mass-energy of 
the  elementary  particle-process  described  above  should  be  expressed  through  the  unique  and  universal 
measure  of  that  complexity  naturally  reflecting  also  the  major  property  of  discreteness  of  quantum 
behaviour and integrating its emerging spatial and temporal aspects. 
The  spatial  structure  element  of  the  electron  is  the  length, x∆ ,  of  the  system  jump  between  two 
 
localised  states  determined  by  the  eigenvalue  spacing  between  the  neighbouring  realisations, 
,  found 
t∆ , emerges as the quantum 
from the effective existence equation, eqs. (7)-(9). The physical time element, 
 (where the speed of light, c, is defined as the 
t
beat period, related to 
speed  of  perturbation  propagation  in  the  e/m  protofield,  coupled  to  the  gravitational  medium).  The 
t∆ , is  the 
simplest,  universally  defined  physical  quantity,  which  is  independently  proportional  to 
,  where  E  and  p  are  coefficients  to  be 
action  increment  in  one  quantum  beat  cycle, 
eventually  identified  with  energy  and  momentum  by  analogy  with  classical  mechanics  for  which  our

universal  description  should  remain  valid.  Therefore  we  can  suppose  that  it  is  the  mechanical  action, 
, 
which  provides,  within  its  extended,  causally  complete  understanding,  the  desired  universal  complexity 
measure. It corresponds to the above general definition of complexity through the total realisation number

(section  3)  because  ∆

the  universal  quantum  of  action  in  the  form  of  Planck's  constant  h,  it  is  clear  that  for  processes  with 
  is  the  universal  quantum  of  complexity,  which  provides  a  new,  deeper 
elementary  particles 
understanding of the physical meaning and importance of h [14,21]. It means that each reduction-extension 
cycle  of  the  essentially  nonlinear,  intrinsically  unstable,  dynamically  discrete  quantum  beat  process 
(sections 2, 3) corresponds to a change of h in the action value attributed to the system, 
, which 
involves a considerable extension of the notion of action itself with respect to the one from the essentially 
linear, unitary mechanics with its uniform evolution and smooth trajectory/path of the system motion.

which  was  semi-axiomatically  introduced  by  de  Broglie  and  further  used  in  his  original  derivation  of  the 
wave  properties  of  elementary  particles,  culminating  in  the  famous  expression  for  the  “de  Broglie 
wavelength” [6]. We emphasize that in our version the simple relation of eq. (19) is causally derived from 
the  physically  based  consideration  of  the  underlying  complex  dynamics  of  interacting  protofields  and 
represents just a compact expression of the essentially nonlinear, fractally entangled, dynamically redundant 
0ν   represents 
(and  thus  probabilistic)  quantum  beat  process  (in  particular,  the  fundamental  frequency 
“something  periodic”,  but  actually  much  more  involved  than  any  linear,  or  even  ordinary  “nonlinear”, 
oscillation).  This  is  the  beginning  of  the  natural  appearance,  within  our  first-principles  analysis,  of  the 
causally  extended,  physically  based  relativity  which  is  intrinsically  unified  with  the  quantized  wave 
dynamics  of  the  elementary  field-particle  and  its  dualistic  internal  structure,  being  simply  another 
manifestation of the same dynamic complexity that underlies quantum behaviour of the system of coupled 
protofields [14,16]. 
 
If  now  the  isolation  of  the  elementary  field-particle  is  violated  and  it  is  subjected  to  external 
influences (coming from other particles and transmitted through the common physical “world manifold” of 
two coupled protofields), then the intensity of the quantum beat, and thus particle energy, can change. We 
can rigorously define the state of rest of the elementary field-particle (and eventually of a macroscopic body 
consisting  from  such  particles)  as  the  state  with  minimum  complexity-energy.  This  minimum exists, since 
the  quantum  beat  energy  is  always  positive  and  finite.  For  the  elementary  field-particle  it  is  realised  as 
totally  irregular  spatial  distribution  of  the  reduction  centres,  which  corresponds  to  the  absolutely 
homogeneous distribution of realisation probabilities, causally deduced above within the generalised Born's 
rule  (section  3)  or simply as a result of “equal rights” for emergence of apparently equivalent realisations 
(eqs. (16a) in section 2). 
 
It  is  not  difficult  to  make  the  straightforward  next  step  and  introduce  an  equally  rigorous  and 
universal  definition  of  a  state  of  motion  as  any  system  state  characterised  by  a  complexity-energy  value 
exceeding the minimum value of the state of rest for this system. Naturally, there can be many such higher 
values of energy and many respective states of motion. Since the particle state of rest has a unique, totally 

 

17 

uniform spatial structure, it is clear that any state of motion of the field-particle will be characterised by an 
inhomogeneous  spatial  distribution  of  probabilities  of  reduction  to  different  centres  (system  realisations), 
corresponding  to  a  dynamic  tendency  in  the  thus  emerging  global  motion  of  the  field-particle,  always 
remaining  a  well-defined  complex-dynamical  process  [14,16].  Similarly,  any  state  of  motion  of  a  more 
complex,  necessarily  inhomogeneous,  object  is  characterised  by  a  more  inhomogeneous  distribution  of 
realisation  probabilities  than  that  for  its  state  of  rest.  Whereas  the  centre  of  each  next  reduction  event  is 
“chosen” by the system always in a purely probabilistic fashion, there is now more “order in chaos”, and the 
emerging  more  inhomogeneous  structure  in  the  reduction  (realisation)  probability  distribution  manifests 
itself  as  observable  spatial  degrees  of  freedom  (or  “spatial  structure”)  of  the  progressing  “(sub)level  of 
complexity”  of  the  system,  that  is  the  particle/object  “displacement”  as  such.  In  terms  of  the  proposed 
A
mathematical  measures  of  complexity  (action  and  energy-mass),  this  means  that  our  action-complexity 
 
for the field-particle in a state of motion acquires a (regular) spatial dependence (structure), whereas in the 
state  of  rest  it  depends  only  on  time.  Therefore  the  partial  time  derivative  of  action  of  the  moving  field-
particle,  always  defining  its  energy,  is  now different from the total time derivative, in full agreement with 
the well established relations from the classical mechanics:

The relation of eq. (23) replaces its limiting case of eqs. (18), (19) valid for the same field-particle at 
rest, and includes the rigorously specified and causally substantiated definitions of the emerging space, time, 
momentum, and energy, applicable also in the general case. The causally defined field-particle spin (section 
3) can be taken into account within the same relation [14], but in order to emphasize most important new 
moments, we shall not do it explicitly here, limiting ourselves to the case of negligible spin-related effects. 
Note that the characteristic temporal intervals for the moving particle, τ and Τ, are both different from the 
0τ   for  the  particle  at  rest  because  the  modified  intensity,  and  thus  temporal  rate,  of  the 
single  time  scale 
quantum  beat  process  constitutes  the  real  physical  mechanism  of  the  global  motion  as  such:  in  order  to 
advance  as  a  whole,  the particle should relatively (with respect to the state of rest) intensify (make more 
frequent)  its  reduction-extension  cycles  “in  the  direction  of  motion”  at  the  expense  of  those  in  other 
directions,  which  reveals  already  the  fundamental  physical  source  of  the  “relativity  of  time”  (it  will  be 
further  specified  below).  We  see  also  that  the  appearance  of  global  motion  is  naturally  involved  with 
emergence of an elementary spatial structure of the moving field-particle, in the form of an average regular 
tendency within the generally chaotic wave field. It is not difficult to understand that this averaged structure 
is none other than the causally extended, realistic “de Broglie wave of the (moving) particle”, whereas its 
, is the “de Broglie wavelength”, and we shall continue to confirm and specify this 
characteristic size, 
conclusion below. The physical meaning of the energy partition of eq. (23) becomes clear: the second term,

corresponding “thermodynamical”, phenomenological considerations of Louis de Broglie [10]. 
 
Further refinement of mathematical description of the quantum beat dynamics for the moving field-
particle, eq. (23), should produce a relation between the temporal (E) and spatial (p) rates of the complex-
dynamical  structure  formation  process  called,  in  accord  with  tradition,  dispersion  relation.  The  holistic 
character of the quantum beat dynamics shows that such a relation should exist in a well-defined form and 
can  be  rigorously  deduced:  the  regular  global  structure  of  the  wave  field  (p)  is  formed  by  the  same 
reduction-extension  cycles  as  those  determining  the  general  quantum  beat  intensity  (E).  The  dispersion 
relation  we  are  looking  for  can  be  considered  as  the  causally  completed  version  of  the  “phase  accord 
theorem”  introduced  by  Louis  de  Broglie  in  his  original  substantiation  of  existence  of  a  wave  associated 
with  a  particle  [6].  While  the  wave  existence  is  assumed  and  its  detailed  physical  origin  remains  unclear 
within  this  original  formulation,  de  Broglie  shows  that  if  the  “internal  oscillations”  of  the  particle,  also 
postulated  by  the  heuristically  composed  analogue  of  eq.  (19),  remain  always  in  phase  with  those  of  the 
wave  (i.  e.  physically  the  wave  performs  the  stationary  transport  of,  “pilots”,  or  “develops”, the particle-
oscillation), then such “compound object” moves in accord with the relativistic transformations of time and 
mass (also formally postulated in the standard relativity) and the length of the wave is given by the (now) 
canonical  expression  for  the  “de  Broglie  wavelength”.  The  quantum  beat  dynamics  involves  a  self-
consistently  unified,  causal  extension  of  the  participating  entities  and  their  “phase  accord”:  the  localised 
“particle” (virtual soliton) moves always “in phase” with the extended wave (“intermediate realisation of the 
system”, section 3) simply because it is permanently transformed into that wave and back, in course of its 

interpretation  confirms  and  completes

coupled  protofields).  In  other  words,  the  internal  “particle  oscillations”  and  the  “piloting”  wave  motion 
represent  two  dynamically  related,  alternating  and  therefore  coexisting  aspects  of  one  and  the  same 
quantum beat process. Another essential extension of the original phase-accord idea is in the fact that the 
regular,  averaged  structure  of  the  entire  wave  field,  forming  the  causal  analogue  of  the  “transporting 
wave”,  represents  only  a  part  of  the  whole  wave-field  dynamics,  and  the  localised  virtual  soliton,  or 
“particle”,  makes  many  essential,  irregular  deviations  from  that  regular  tendency,  “taking”  with  it  the 
corresponding extended wave structures that form in this case a causally random, irregular part of the wave 
field,  always  preserving,  however,  the  internal  “phase  accord”  between  “particle”  and  “wave”.  It  is  clear 
that only the averaged regular structure of the wave field, the causally completed version of the “de Broglie 
wave”, can be directly observed in experiments as a wave, while the stochastic, purely random components 
of the field-particle dynamics appear only “statistically”, in the form of the particle (rest) mass. 
Consider a portion of that regular undulatory spatial structure of the wave field in the state of global

motion  incorporating  n  (de  Broglian)  wavelengths, 
0x , in the direction of 
quantum beat process determining the (total) energy covers the (measured) distance, 
motion,  remaining  in  the  described  involvement  with  the  wave,  but  simultaneously  performs  extensive 
irregular, “sideways” deviations (wandering). Since the velocity of the virtual soliton propagation along the 
actual  irregular  path  should  always  be  equal  to  the  velocity  of  light,  c  (it  is  the  velocity  of  the  directly 
observable  perturbation  propagation  in  e/m  medium/protofield),  it  becomes  clear  that  the  energy-bearing

oscillation  of  the  quantum  beat  actually  performs 
  cycles  within  the  observed  portion  of  the

multiplying  it  by h, and using the definitions for momentum and energy, eqs. (21), (24), we finally obtain

causally  deduced  the  famous  “relativistic”  dispersion  relation  from  the  detailed  analysis  of  the  unreduced 
complex  (chaotic)  dynamics  actually  underlying  any  externally  “uniform”  motion  (whereas  it  is  derived 
from formal postulates in the canonical theory, see e. g. refs. [22,23]) and simultaneously specified the law 
2c , in the yet more famous energy-mass relation, already physically 
of proportionality and the coefficient, 
substantiated above and also only mechanistically “guessed” in the standard relativity. 
 
We can see now the origin of the characteristic inconsistency around the superluminal de Broglian 
“wave of phase” [6], being both physically unreal and indispensable for the proposed realistic approach: if

one  does  not  explicitly  take  into  account  the  really  existing,  intrinsically  irregular  part  of  the  holistic, 
inseparable  quantum  beat  dynamics,  then  the  corresponding  part  of  energy  is  “forced”  to  reappear  in  a 
reduced  form  of  regular  motion,  inevitably  becoming  “superluminal”  because  of  its  “excessive”  quantity. 
The  problem  solution  proposed  by  de  Broglie  and  transforming  the  ambiguous  “wave  of  phase”, 
, into a real wave transport of the particle by the linear wave packet 
propagating with the velocity
,  cannot  really  solve  the  problem,  since  the  purely  linear 
moving  with  the  proper  group  velocity 
transformation  between  the  phase  and  group  wave  propagation  shows  fundamental  divergence  with  the 
necessarily and essentially nonlinear character of the wave mechanics (in particular, the linear wave packets 
quickly spread etc.). The realistic undulatory behaviour of the moving elementary particle should indeed be 
obtained  from  many  participating,  slightly  differing  components,  but  in  an  adequate,  essentially nonlinear 
description  they  should  necessarily  (strongly)  interact  with  each  other,  which  leads,  as  shown  above 
(sections 2, 3), to the intrinsically unstable character of the resulting quantum beat dynamics. The nonlinear 
component interaction takes the form of their ruthless competition in which only those corresponding to the 
current tendency (reduction to a randomly selected centre or the opposite extension) can survive and form 
both  the  localised  “particle”  and  its  “wave  transport”.  Only  the  unreduced  involvement  of  the  largely 
hidden, but really existing complex-dynamical processes including many incompatible state-realisations can 
consistently explain the externally simple “relativistic” and “quantum” relations between mass, energy, and 
momentum,  eqs.  (19),  (25),  and  it  is  the  insertion  of  the  physically  substantiated  and  rigorously  derived 
dispersion  relation,  eq.  (25),  into  the  emerging  momentum  definition,  eq.  (21),  that  finally  closes  the 
causally complete substantiation of de Broglie's expression for the wavelength: 

 
= v  .                                                                 (26)

We emphasize the crucial importance of the obtained dispersion relation, eq. (25), for the complete 
 
understanding  of  the  meaning  of  eq.  (26).  It  is  the  deceptively  familiar,  “classical”  and  almost  “trivial” 
relation between the particle momentum, mass, and velocity,  p m= v
, that bounds together the wave-like, 
corpuscular  (classical)  and  relativistic  properties  of  the  elementary  field-particle  into  the  intrinsically 
inseparable  (within  the  unreduced  description)  and  most  “mysterious”  (within  the  conventional  theory) 
mixture summarised by the fundamental de Broglie equation. Note also that the same dispersion relation is 
actually  equivalent  to  the main dynamical laws of classical mechanics (Newton's laws and their relativistic 
extension), which are obtained in their canonical form by taking the time derivative of eq. (25). We see now 
that  these  laws  can  also  be  causally  derived,  instead  of  being  postulated  in  the  canonical,  dynamically 
single-valued approach, if we take into account the internal complex (multivalued) dynamics of any motion, 
including  all  the  externally  “uniform”  and  “rectilinear”  cases  (the  detailed  mechanism  of  transition  from 
quantum  to  classical  behaviour  is  outlined  in  section  7).  The  applicability  of  these  conclusions  to  any 
macroscopic, many-particle body follows not only from the fact that they apply to every its part, but from 
the  unlimited  effective  universality  [14]  of  our  description  of  unreduced  interaction  dynamics (section 2), 
playing  thus  an  important  role  as  reflection  of  the  necessarily  profound  coherence  within  the  multi-level 
complex-dynamical world construction (we continue to specify this conclusion below, in sections 6, 7). 
The  emerging  causal  unification  of  the  (extended)  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  within  our 
 
theory  does  not  stop  there,  and  we  continue  to  specify  it  by  inserting  the  causally  derived  dispersion 
relation,  eq.  (25),  into  the  basic  energy  partition  of  eq.  (23)  and  using  the  complex-dynamic  energy 
definition, eq. (24), which gives:

This  relation  provides  further  refinement  of  the  causally  complete  explanation  of  the  “relativistic  time 
retardation” that cannot be separated from the unreduced, realistic understanding of the entity of time itself 
(absent in the conventional relativity [22,23]). Since time naturally emerges together with structure-forming 
reduction-extension  events  that  constitute  the  quantum-beat  global  motion,  the  increased  intensity  (rate, 
frequency) of this process for the (relatively) moving field-particle(s) is realised as a relative decrease of the 
elementary quantum beat period, τ, which results in relative retardation of any other process from a higher 
level of complexity within the moving group of particles (a physical “body”), irrespective of their detailed 
dynamics (their duration with respect to the state of rest is proportional to the relatively increased “internal” 
quantum  beat  period,  Τ).  An  equivalent  formulation  involves  “transport  effects”  for  the  appearing 
undulatory structure and is determined by the difference between the total and partial time derivatives of the 
field-particle  action-complexity  (see  eq.  (20)):  they  lead  to  a  relative  increase  of  the  local  “total-change” 
(irregular-motion) period Τ that just determines relative local duration of any internal motion cycle. In other 
words,  causal  time  within  the  moving  system,  with  respect  to  the  state  of  rest,  goes  as  nΤ(with 
permanently and autonomously growing integer n), and the relative duration of any given process equals to 
0n Τ, where 
0n  depends only on the internal process type, but not on its global state of motion. 
 
quantum beat periods τ and Τ through the reference period in the state of rest, 
[14] that the corresponding frequencies, ν, Ν, and 

In order to obtain the causal time retardation effect in the explicit form, we should now express the 
0τ . It is not difficult to see 

0ν  are related by the following equation:

which gives, for the periods, 

.                                                                 (28b) 

 
These  relations  can  be  reduced  to  a  physically  transparent  law  of  “conservation  of  the  total  number  of 
reduction events” which is a manifestation of the universal complexity conservation law [14]. In our case, it 
stems simply from the fact that the driving electro-gravitational coupling remains unchanged for any global 
motion  state  of  the  field-particle,  and  therefore  the  total  number  of  reduction  events  (per  unit  of  time), 
including  both  the  regular  tendency  and  irregular  deviations,  should  be  the  same  in  the  states  of  rest  and 
(uniform)  motion  (respectively  the  right-  and  left-hand  sides  of  eq.  (28a)),  while  the  relative  proportions 
(intensity) of global regularity and random deviations from it change between different states of motion (and 
rest). Using eqs. (28) in conjunction with eq. (27), we get the canonical expression of the time retardation 
effect, now causally explained by the underlying physical picture of complex quantum beat dynamics:

The  summarised  expression  of  the  complex  dynamics  of  a  moving  field-particle,  eqs.  (30),  (31), 
 
including  the  “ordinary”  type  of  relation  between  the  causal  de  Broglie  wavelength,  frequency,  and 
wave/particle velocity,  B Bλν = v
, clearly demonstrates the physical reality of this wave and demystifies its 
origin. In particular,  Bν  is the average frequency of the dynamically quantized, step-like propagation of the 
Bλ  during  each  indivisible  and  irregularly  occurring  step 
“travelling”  de  Broglie  wave  that  advances  to 
(coinciding  with  the  corresponding  virtual  soliton  jump).  In  this  respect  the  averaged,  de  Broglian  wave 
field  of  a  moving  field-particle  resembles,  due  to  the  internal  nonlinearity,  both  travelling  and  standing 
undular  structure,  the  latter  having  spatially  fixed  nodal  planes.  This  averaged,  global-motion  tendency, 
represented by the second summand in eqs. (30), could not exist without purely irregular deviations from it 
(“thermal  motion”),  represented  by  the  first  term  in eqs. (30), and their ratio, R, equal to the ratio of the 
corresponding  frequencies,  shows  the  relative  number  of  probabilistic  quantum  jumps  falling  within  the 
regular tendency and taken with respect to the number of purely irregular events:

is only slightly inhomogeneous and only a small portion of the probabilistic “quantum jumps” of the system 
and  the  related  wave-field  structures  falls  within  the  regular  tendency  forming  de  Broglie  wave.  The 
,  only  at  moderate 
structure  of  the  probabilistic  wave  field  becomes  remarkably  ordered, 
2
relativistic  velocities  of  the  global  motion  (
).  And  finally,  it  is  almost  totally  (but  never 
completely)  ordered, 
).  The 
relativistic  ordering  of  the  internal  soliton  wandering  around  the  regular  tendency  explains,  in  particular, 
why the high-energy “quantum” particles show little observable deviations from the classical, “trajectorial” 
type of behaviour, even though nothing points to this feature in the canonical quantum postulates basically 
separated from any “relativistic effects”, in the canonical interpretation. 
 
Thus the causally complete, dynamic meaning of “relativistic” motion and velocity is revealed within 
the unreduced picture of complex dynamics of the elementary field-particle. The “relativity” of the observed 
temporal  and  spatial  aspects  of  dynamics  is  an  explicit,  direct  manifestation  of  its  internal  complexity 
(dynamic multivaluedness), fundamentally inseparable from “quantum” manifestations of the same dynamic 
complexity  (quantized  spatial  and  probabilistic  temporal  structure  of  the  protofield  interaction  process), 
even though the two types of manifestations seem not to be directly related, both in practical observations 
and  within  the  canonical,  unitary  versions  of  quantum  mechanics  and  relativity,  both  of  them  actually 
describing, as we can clearly see now, only the external, effectively one-dimensional “shape”, or projection, 
of  the  real,  dynamically  multivalued  motion.  The  increasingly  relativistic  character  of  dynamics  with  the 
growing  global  motion  velocity  corresponds  to  growing  dynamic  complexity,  measured  by  such  related 
quantities  as  E,  p,  R,  and  β.  Physically  this  change  corresponds  to  increasing  order  within  the  causally 
chaotic  dynamics,  always  preserving,  however,  its  intrinsically  probabilistic  character  at  every  single  step 
(quantum  jump  of  the  virtual  soliton).  This  latter  feature  explains why any dynamically complex, massive 
1β= ) would 
particle  cannot  not  only  exceed,  but  even  attain  the  velocity  of  light:  the  condition 
correspond  to  the  totally  regular,  zero-complexity  dynamics,  where  the  field-particle  could  not  have  any 
possibility  for  irregular  deviations  from  the  global  tendency,  while  the  latter  would  lose  the  intrinsically 
probabilistic character of each virtual soliton jump. Only massless, totally regular perturbations of the e/m 
protofield (like photons [14]) propagate with the speed of light. 
 
We can physically understand now why the global, regular motion of a massive field-particle (and 
thus of any “ordinary”, structure-forming matter) necessarily involves the “relativistic” increase of its total 
inertial  mass,  i.  e.  why  any  energy  possesses  the  property  of  inertia:  this is because any part of the total 
complex  process  of  motion,  including  the  regular  in  average  global  tendency,  occurs  through  an 
intrinsically  random  choice  of  each  participating  individual  reduction  centre,  thus  giving  rise  to  inertia, 
according to the above causal interpretation of the latter. Therefore, as follows from eqs. (30´),

It  becomes  clear  also  why  and  how  various  other  forms  of  energy  contribute  to  the  total  mass-energy-
complexity:  for  example,  a  “binding”,  attractive  interaction  potential  partially  limits  the  chaotic  motion 
liberty  in  the  system  and  therefore  makes  a  negative  contribution  to  its  mass-energy,  while  a  repulsive 
interaction  can  only  increase  dynamic  randomness  and  therefore  contributes  positively  to  the  chaoticity-
driven inertia.

5. Causal quantization of complex electron dynamics and wave equations 

 
If  we  want  to  obtain  an  adequate  description  of  the  intrinsic  wave-particle  duality  of  the  quantum 
 
beat  process,  then  the  above  results  should  be  completed  by  the  explicitly  wave-like,  delocalised  type  of 
formal presentation accounting for the causally probabilistic wave field of the field-particle in its extended 
phase that corresponds to the physically real “intermediate” realisation through which the system performs 
its  permanent  transitions  (or  “quantum  jumps”)  between  the  “regular”  realisations  of  localised  “virtual 
soliton”  (section  3).  That  delocalised,  partially  ordered,  dynamically  maintained  structure  of  the  e/m 
protofield interacting with the gravitational protofield is described by the physically based wavefunction, Ψ, 
which  arises  from  the  initial  “state-function”  of  the  interacting  protofields  as  its  special,  “intermediate” 
realisation  (section  2)  and  is  the  causal  extension  of  the  canonical  wavefunction  introduced  by  Erwin 
Schrödinger  (see  ref.  [24]).  The  essential  difference  between  the  two  is  due  to  the  dynamically  complex, 
chaotic  physical  nature  of  the  extended  version,  which  definitely  resolves  the  basic  difficulties  of  the 
canonical description around its imposed probabilistic “interpretation” of Ψ by preserving the direct relation 
of the mathematical function Ψ to the physically real, dynamically probabilistic wave field of the quantum 
2Ψ   as  the 
beat  process  and  thus  causally  justifying  “Born's  probability  rule”,  which  now  explains 
probability of emergence of the localised particle-realisation as a result of the dynamical auto-squeeze of the 
causal  wavefunction  (sections  2,  3)  [14,15,24].  We  resolve  also  the  related  problem  of  the  abstract 
“configurational  space”  by  providing 
the  mathematical  “coordinate”,  or 
“configuration”,  on  which  the  canonical  wavefunction  depends:  the  causal  wavefunction  is  defined on the 
physically  real  space  of  dynamically  emerging  centres  of  reduction,  or  “point”-realisations,  the  latter 
providing the causal version of system “configurations” (that can have, in principle, any “shape”). 
 
We see also that the interaction-driven essential nonlinearity of the particular system of real physical 
protofields,  originating simply from their unreduced interaction and leading to the dynamic multiplicity of 
redundant  state-realisations,  permits  us  to  replace  a  rather  sophisticated  and  ambiguous  combination  of 
several  components  of  an  additional,  specially  introduced  “quantum  field”  in  the  original  version  of  the 
“double  solution”  [9]  by  the  single,  causally  obtained  wavefunction  representing  the  real  and  unifying 
dynamical  state  of  the  participating  physical  fields.  This  state  can  be  presented  (section  4)  as  a  naturally 
emerging dynamic combination of the regular, averaged wave-field structure (the de Broglie matter wave, 
now  provided  with  the  causally  specified,  really  material  basis)  and  the  irregular  wave  field  (with  a

solution and entering now into the delocalised (undulatory) description of complex field-particle dynamics.

6. Physical origin of fundamental interactions, their unification, 
and complex-dynamical basis of general relativity effects 

 
 
The  unreduced  description  of  reality  within  the  emerging  dynamic  redundance  paradigm  and 
universal complexity concept (section 2) provides the naturally “cosmological”, evolutionary picture of the 
world  dynamics,  where  the  existing  entities  are  explicitly  obtained  in  full  agreement  with  their  actual 
appearance  in  the  universe  formation  processes  (this  is  a  manifestation  of  the  explicit  creativity  of  our 
analysis, as opposed to its invariable absence in the conventional, unitary theory, cf. section 1). In particular, 
it  becomes  clear  that  the  unreduced  interaction  of  two  extended  protofields  leads  to  emergence  of  many 
local  dynamically  multivalued  processes  of  quantum  beat,  each  of  them  representing  a  well-specified 
physical  structure  of  the  elementary  particle.  In  agreement  with  the  basic  property  of  dynamic 
multivaluedness,  there  can  be  many  different  elementary  particles,  each  of  them  corresponding  to  a 
particular  EP  realisation  (specified  mainly  by  the  potential  well  parameters).  The  appearing  particle-
processes  modify  local  properties  (average  tension,  density)  of  the  protofields,  which  leads  to  interaction 
between particles through each of the protofields. The increasing protofield tension leads also to saturation 
of  the  total  number  of  particles  (and  thus  matter)  in  the  universe,  for  the  given  protofield  properties  and 
magnitude  of  their  attraction  to  each  other.  Due  to  the  fundamentally  self-consistent  character  of  the 
unreduced EP dynamics (section 2), we obtain thus a self-tuning universe, which resolves a whole series of 
stagnating problems in the conventional theory. 
Limiting ourselves here only to a brief outline of the obtained results (see refs. [14-16,21] for more 
 
details), we note as one of the most physically transparent results the explanation of the origin, total number 
(four), and basic properties of the fundamental interaction types between the elementary particles. Namely, 
the  e/m  and  “weak”  interaction  forces  are  transmitted  through  the  e/m  protofield  material, where the e/m 

 

27 

interactions  correspond  to  the  “long-range”  interaction  type  (analogous  to  “deformational”  interaction 
between  density  perturbations  in  continuous  media),  while  the  weak  interaction  force  originates  from  the 
direct,  short-range  interaction  between  the  e/m  protofield  constituents.  Similarly,  the  gravitational  and 
“strong”  interaction  forces  are  transmitted  through  the  gravitational  protofield/medium  (represented  most 
probably by a dense quark condensate), where the universal gravitation (thus causally explained) appears as 
the  long-range  interaction  mode,  while  the  strong  interaction  results  from  the  short-range,  “contact” 
interaction between proto-quarks (gravitational protofield elements). It is extremely important that the four 
fundamental  interactions  thus  obtained  are  intrinsically  and  permanently  unified  within  the  quantum  beat 
dynamics,  especially  of  the  heaviest  elementary  particles.  We  also  obtain  the  quantum  (dynamically 
quantized)  origin  of  all  fundamental  interactions,  including  gravity,  which  resolves  another  stagnating 
problem of the unitary theory (but the result is different from the conventional attempts and expectations of 
formal  “quantization  of  gravity”  and  will  be  practically  important  only  at  extremely  small  space  and  time 
scales [14,16]). Various intrinsic properties of the fundamental particle interactions also naturally emerge in 
our description, such as the direct relation between inertial and gravitational manifestations of the quantum 
beat  process  (the  extended  “principle  of  equivalence”),  and  the  origin,  universality,  and  two  “opposite” 
species of the quantized electric charge. 
 
Note also the essential difference between the postulated fixed, “geometrical” (abstract) description 
of gravity in the conventional “general relativity” and our causally derived, purely dynamical, and naturally 
quantized  gravitation  that  produces,  however,  the  same  “relativistic”  modification  of  space  and  time,  but 
now causally related to their clearly specified physical origin (where space and time emerge as qualitatively 
different, only dynamically related entities) [14,16]. In the unreduced description of gravity, the nonuniform 
tension  of  the  gravitational  medium  is  associated  with  the  corresponding  inhomogeneous  distribution  of 
individual  quantum  beat  processes  and  can be expressed by the respective “gravitational potential”, rather 
than  a  formal  “metric”  of  the abstract space-time geometry. Thus, for the case of static gravitational field 
(cf. ref. [23]) one obtains, instead of eq. (19):

corresponding to the universal gravitational attraction, the above equation substantiates the causal version 
of  the  “relativistic  time  retardation”  in the gravitational field. This natural involvement of gravity with the 
dynamically quantized behaviour of micro-objects can be further specified [14,16], but we shall not present 
here  all  the  details,  being  interested  rather  in  the  fundamental  unification  of  quantum  and  relativistic 
behaviour,  originating from the unreduced dynamic complexity of the elementary field-particles. The most 
fundamental,  and  always  present,  evidence  of  this  unique  causal  origin  of  the  quantum  “mysteries”  and 
relativistic “paradoxes”, the unreduced dynamic complexity (multivaluedness) of the underlying interaction 
process,  is  provided  by  the  intrinsically unified mass-energy-complexity, determined by the rate (intensity) 
of  the  chaotic  quantum  beat  process  and  giving  quantum  behaviour,  inertia,  gravity,  and  relativistic 
dynamics (see eqs. (18)-(19), (23)-(26), (30)-(32), (36)-(38), (39)).

7. Classical behaviour emergence and the unified hierarchy 
of complex dynamics of the world 

 
 
The extended causality should include dynamic unification with higher-level systems and behaviour, 
in  the  form  of  their  natural  emergence  from  the  described  level  of  elementary  field-particles.  The  next 
higher  sublevel  of  complexity  results  indeed  from  the  essentially  quantum  dynamics,  in  the  form  of 
dynamically redundant and therefore chaotic (complex) behaviour of the interacting field-particles. Dynamic 
complexity  here  can  take  the  form  of  either  true  quantum  (Hamiltonian)  chaos  (in  the  absence  of 
dissipation),  or  causally  extended  quantum  measurement  (slightly  dissipative,  open-system  dynamics) 
[14,17]. The latter can be considered as a complex-dynamical particle interaction process (cf. section 2), but 
involving,  due  to  dissipativity,  formation  of  a  transient  quasi-bound  state  between  two  (or  several) 
elementary  field-particles  whose  virtual  solitons  perform,  during  a  transiently  short  period,  their  chaotic 
“quantum  jumps”  in  a  close  vicinity  of  each  other,  thus  temporary  reducing  the  long-range  “wave 
properties” of the “measured” particle. 
When the (attractive) interaction magnitude is large enough, such transient bound state of the field-
 
particles can become a stable (permanent) bound state (like that of an atom), and a new level of complexity 
emerges, that of the classical behaviour. Indeed, due to the sufficiently strong attraction within the bound 
state  of  elementary  field-particles  their  virtual  solitons  should  always  remain  close  to  each  other  while 
performing  their  spatially  random  jumps,  which  limits  the  probability  of  their larger “correlated walks” to 
low, exponentially decreasing values and results in a well-localised, confined, or trajectorial type of chaotic 
dynamics.  This  (complex-)  dynamically  emerging  classical  character  of  the  elementary  (and  larger)  bound 
systems  is  quite  different  from  both  canonical  semi-classical  behaviour  that  need  not  be  localised,  and 
canonical  (ill-defined)  notion  of  classicality,  since  our  elementary  classical  system  need  not  be 
“macroscopic” or “dissipative” (open to contacts with an “environment” that produces “decoherence”), but 
is  always  internally,  dynamically  chaotic  (even  though  external  interactions  can  quantitatively  modify 
localisation and the ensuing classicality). 
 
The  hierarchical  complexity  development  continues  in  the  same  general  fashion  to  all  the  higher 
levels:  the  quasi-localised  trajectory  of  a  classical,  bound  system  becomes  dynamically  irregular,  and  thus 
again  delocalised,  due  to  any  real  interaction(s)  with  other  classical  system(s),  then  bound,  “condensed” 
(many-particle) systems of higher levels are formed, etc. It is important that the same qualitative concept of 
dynamic  redundance  and  the  related  quantitative  description  remain  valid  at  any  level  of  (irreducibly 
complex)  reality  and  are  represented  by  the  localised,  trajectorial  formalism  (Hamilton-Lagrange  equation 
generalising the ordinary Hamilton-Jacobi equation) and delocalised, state-functional formalism (generalised 
Schrödinger  equation)  [14,24],  the  latter  extending  various  canonical  equations  for  quantum  and  classical 
“density matrix” and “distribution function”. We see now that the consistent, causal explanation of quantum 
phenomena is attained together with the truly consistent, and essentially different from canonical, causally 
extended  description  of  the  classical,  macroscopic  behaviour,  within  the  same  concept  of  the  unreduced 
dynamic complexity. All the “specific” strangeness of quantum behaviour is due simply to the fact that it is 
observed at several lowest, naturally coarse-grained levels of complexity, where dissipation (interaction with 
other  levels)  is  strongly  suppressed  and  the  universal  process  of  chaotic  realisation  change  appears  in  its 
unveiled, “explicitly complex-dynamical” (dynamically multivalued) form which only seems to be weird with 
respect to unrealistically simplified, dynamically single-valued approach of the canonical, unitary theory.

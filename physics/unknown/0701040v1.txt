Abstract 
We  present  here  the  results  of  calculations  of  photoelectrons’  angular  anisotropy  and 
spin-polarization parameters for a number of semi-filled shell atoms. We consider ionization 
of outer or in some cases next to the outer electrons in a number of elements from I, V, and 
VI  groups  of  the  Periodic  Table.  All  calculations  are  performed  with  account  of  multi-
electron  correlations  in  the  frame  of  the  Spin  Polarized  version  of  the  Random  Phase 
Approximation with Exchange – SP RPAE. We consider the dipole angular distribution and 
spin polarization of photoelectrons from semi-filled subshells and from closed shells that are 
neighbours to the semi-filled shells.  
 
We  have  considered  also  angular  anisotropy  and  spin-polarization  of  photoelectrons 
from some excited atoms that are formed by spin-flip of one of the outer electrons. To check 
the  accuracy  and  consistency  of  the  applied  SP  RPAE  approach  and  to  see  the  role  of  the 
nuclear  charge  variation  only,  we  have  calculated  the  dipole  angular  anisotropy  and  spin-
polarization parameters of 3p - electrons in K and compare them to Ar and K+ that have the 
same configuration.  
 
Entirely,  we  have  calculated  the  angular  anisotropy  and  spin-polarization  parameters 
for following subshells of atoms N (2p), P (3p), Ar (3p), K+(3p), K(3p), Cr(3p, 3d), Cr*(3d), 
Mn(3p, 3d), As(3d, 4p), Mo(4p, 4d), Mo*(4d), Tc(4p, 4d, ), Sb(4d, 5p), Eu(4f). 

The  peculiarities  of  obtained  parameters  as  function  of  photon  frequencies  are 

discussed, as well as some specific features of considered semi-filled shell objects.

  However, there exists a number of atoms, almost one-third of the Periodic Table, that can 
be considered as semi-filled shell objects and treated almost as accurate as close shell atoms, 
accounting for electron correlations in the frame of so-called Spin-Polarised Random Phase 
Approximation  with  Exchange  –  SP  RPAE  [3,  4].  In  the  frame  of  this  approximation  we

studied recently the non-dipole angular anisotropy parameters of semi-filled shell atoms [5]. 
These parameters were calculated long before for Mn only [6]. 
  Angular distribution in the dipole approximation has been studied for a number of closed 
shell atoms (see e.g. [3, 4]). Attention was given also to semi-filled shell atoms Cr and Mn 
[7, 8]. 
 
Spin polarization parameters that determine the orientation of photoelectron spin relative 
to  the  photons  flux  or  to  their  polarization  direction  are  important  characteristics  of  the 
photoionization  process.  It  was  demonstrated  long  ago  [9],  that  spin  polarization  of 
photoelectrons, although it is caused by relatively weak spin-orbit interaction, is not a small 
relativistic effect. It appeared that the spin-orbit interaction acts as a leverage that permits to 
disclose  the  degree  of  photoelectrons  spin  polarization  that  can  reach  at  some  emission 
angles 100% [10].  
  At  the  same  time,  there  was  a  belief  that  investigation  of  spin  polarization  of 
photoelectrons permits to realize the so-called complete experiment in atomic physics, since 
of  the  nl-subshell, 
the  five  parameters,  the  partial  photoionization  cross  section

 and two phase shift differences [11].  

, where j is the total momentum 
photoelectron's spin polarization 
of  the  ionized  shell,  are  sufficient  to  determine  completely  five  theoretical  values,  three 
photoionization amplitudes 
 
Later it was found that these parameters are not mutually independent, and there is one 
equation connecting them [12]. Therefore it is not possible to determine from the experiment 
of  that  kind  5  theoretical  values.  Still  it  is  possible  to  determine  in  that  way  three  non-
relativistic  values,  two  amplitudes  and  one  phase  shift  difference.  As  the  latest  experiment 
shows, the non-relativistic approximation is quite sufficient even in such a heavy atom as Xe 
[12],  and  demonstrates  the  ability  of  this  approach  to  describe  satisfactorily  the 
photoionization  process.  Different  calculations  demonstrated  an  important  role  played  by 
multi-electron  correlations  in  photoionization  and  proved  that  the  latter  can  be  accurately 
enough taken into account in the frames of the Random Phase Approximation with Exchange 
(RPAE)  and  some  of  its  straightforwardly  generalized  versions,  e.g.  GRPAE  or,  for  semi-
filled shell atoms, SP RPAE [3, 4]. 
 
In  this  paper  for  the  first  time  we  have  performed  systematic  studies  of  dipole  angular 
anisotropy  and spin-polarization parameters of photoelectrons from semi-filled shell atoms. 
The  calculations  will  be  performed  in  the  frame  of  SP  RPAE  thus  including  the  effect  of 
important inter-electron correlations. We are expecting that new specific features will appear 
in the angular anisotropy and spin-polarization parameters. 
 
2. Equations for spin polarization 
  Here we follow the paper [1], while more details can be found in [10, 11]. The formula 
,  that  originates  from  photoionization  of  an  atom  with 
for  the  photoelectron  flux

4. Results of calculations and discussion 

Entirely,  we  have  calculated  the  angular  anisotropy  and  spin-polarization  parameters 
for  the  following  subshells  of  atoms  N  (2p),  P  (3p),  Ar  (3p),  K+(3p),  K(3p),  Cr(3p,  3d), 
Cr*(3d), Mn(3p, 3d), As(3d, 4p), Mo(4p, 4d), Mo*(4d), Tc(4p, 4d, ), Sb(4d, 5p), Eu(4f).  

Due  to  interaction  with  the  semi-filled  subshell  electrons  each  closed  subshell  splits 
into two “up” and “down” levels denoted as  ↑  or  ↓ , according to the individual electrons 
spin projection. Thus, the electron configuration of the considered objects is presented in the

-  semi-filled  subshells.  For  s-electrons  the  angular 
parameters  for  single-underlined 
anisotropy parameter is equal to 2 [see (6)] while spin-polarization parameters are according 
to equations (7)-(9) equal to zero. 
 
The results of calculations are presented in Figures 1 -16. We see that all the parameters 
are  rather  complicated  functions  of  frequency.  Particularly  strong  is  the  variation  of 
parameters  in  the  vicinity  of  thresholds,  where  this  is  caused  to  large  extend  by  rather  fast 
variation of the phase differences and their sine's and cosine's functions that enter the angular 
anisotropy and spin-polarization parameters (6-9).

Sb belongs to the same group as As, but has essentially different parameters. Of special 

 
interest is the structure at 150-170 eV, no traces of which exists in

The parameters of Sb 5p electrons are complicated oscillating functions that have not

  We  use  Eu  not  only  to  show  relatively  simple  behavior  of  considered  parameters  as 
functions  of  photon  energy,  but  also  to  demonstrate  the  prominent  role  of  5p  electrons  in 
shaping the angular distribution and spin polarization of photoelectrons from the semi-filled 
4f electrons. 
 
that deserves experimental investigation. 
 
Acknowledgments  

Entirely, in semi-filled subshells and their neighbors we see a whole variety of structure

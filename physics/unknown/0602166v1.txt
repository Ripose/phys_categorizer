Abstract 
The  influence  of  an  externally  applied  magnetic  field  upon  classic  cubic  quintic  dissipative  solitons  is  investigated 
using  both  exact  simulations  and  a  Lagrangian  technique.    The  basic  approach  is  to  use  a  spatially  inhomogeneous 
magnetic  field  and  to  consider  two  important  geometries,  namely  the  Voigt  and  the  Faraday  effects.    A  layered 
structure is selected for the Voigt case with the principal aim being to demonstrate non-reciprocal behaviour for various 
classes of spatial solitons that are known to exist as solutions of the complex Ginzburg-Landau cubic-quintic envelope 
equation under dissipative conditions.  The system is viewed as dynamical and an opportunity is taken to display the 
behaviour patterns of the spatial solitons in terms of two-dimensional dynamical plots involving the total energy and 
the peak amplitude of the spatial solitons. This action this leads to limit cycle plots that beautifully reveal the behaviour 
of  the  solitons  solutions  at  all  points  along  the  propagation  axis.    The  closed  contour  that  exists  in  the  absence  of  a 
magnetic field is opened up and a limit point is exposed.  The onset of chaos is revealed in a dramatic way and it is 
clear that detailed control by the external magnetic field can be exercised.  The Lagrangian approach is adjusted to deal 
with dissipative systems and through the choice of particular trial functions, aspects of the dynamic behaviour of the 
spatial are predicted by this approach.  Finally, some vortex dynamics in the Faraday configuration are investigated.

Introduction 

I. 
 
In  recent  years  a  number  of  papers  have  appeared  that  focus  upon  the  gyroelectric 
behaviour of spatial solitons [1-6].  This kind of work contributes to the growing interest 
in complex media. Material properties enter Maxwell’s equations through the constitutive 
relationship  and  to  move  beyond  purely  isotropic  materials  involves  complexity  that 
could  be  the  addition  of  some  form  of  nonlinearity,  the  introduction  of  anisotropy  or  a 
generalized gyrotropy. Materials can be rigorously classified in terms of their behaviour 
and, in general, the study of bianisotropy [7] is a generic approach that includes natural 
chirality and forced gyrotropy [8], of the kind that is produced by an external magnetic 
field.    Magneto-optics  falls  into  the  latter  category  and  involves  the  polarisation  and 
vector character of light [9].  Given this fact, the application of an external magnetic field 
to a system sustaining spatial solitons holds out the promise of applications based upon 
non-reciprocal gyroelectric behaviour.   This is a dependence upon handedness that will 
be  classified  here  into  forward  and  backward  waves  that  have  a  particular  propagation 
direction  with  respect  to  the  direction  of  the  applied  magnetic  field.    In  some  ways, 
magneto-optic  behaviour  appears  to  be  like  the  natural  chirality  that  is  displayed  by 
solutions of sugar, for example.  This kind of handedness, however, is reversible, which

makes it very different from the non-reciprocal behaviour associated with the magneto-
optically-driven gyroelectric behaviour to be investigated here.  
      In an optically active medium the displacement vector is
D =

ε E g E , where 
0ε  is the permittivity of the free space.

ξg = k  is called the gyration vector,  the wave vector  is  k  and  ξ is a  constant for the

 is an applied magnetic flux density. Clearly in this 
here to be another constant, and 
g depends only upon the direction of the applied magnetic field so the rotation of the 
case 
plane  of  polarisation  around  this  field  cannot  be  reversed  by  reversing  the  propagation 
direction. In other words, non-reciprocal behaviour can now be expected. 
 
 Magneto-optics in the linear domain is a significant global activity with a lot of emphasis 
on  the  generation  of  Kerr  rotations  [10].    There  is  also  a  considerable  interest  in  the 
nonlinear Kerr rotation to be found in the second-harmonic generated by reflecting laser 
beams off magnetic surfaces.  This investigation sets out to extend the reach of magnet-
optics to include the propagation of dissipative spatial solitons, under the non-reciprocal 
influence  of  adjacent,  or  ambient,  magneto  optical  materials.    The  latter  are  widely 
available  and  are  in  a  very  advanced  state,  so  it  should  be  possible  to  investigate 
experimentally the kind of predictions discussed below. 
 
In the model to be developed below a wave guiding structure is used, for the Voigt effect, 
in which spatial solitons are created under conditions of loss and gain but with the layer 
sustaining the spatial solitons, being interfaced to a magneto-optic substrate composed of 
a classic material like the magnetic insulators called rare-earth iron garnets [10] (YIG).   
 
The basic complex Ginzburg-Landau cubic-quintic equation is established[11,12], below, 
together with the relevant magneto-optical influence. This is followed up by a Lagrangian 
analysis designed for a dissipative medium. The numerical work, first of all, establishes 
nonreciprocal behaviour, using exact simulations. These are then examined in the light of 
the Lagrangian analysis in order to discover whether the Lagrangian work offers anything 
more that a qualitative or semi-quantitative guide to the exact behaviour. The paper ends 
with a brief account of some interesting work on the behaviour of vortices in a external 
magnetic field. 
 
II. 
    The  analysis  here  focuses,  initially,  upon  an  asymmetric  waveguide  that  contains  a 
nonlinear layer sustaining spatial solitons.  The waveguide needs to be asymmetric if the 
Voigt effect is not to be negligible [1-6]. The nonlinear layer sits upon a magneto-optic 
substrate and has an air cladding. Addressing the magneto-optics first, a time-dependence

existence of off-diagonal elements that are positioned within the tensor in response to the 
direction of the propagating waves, relative to the direction of the applied magnetic field. 
In this investigation, the propagation is along the z-axis and the applied magnetic field is 
along the z-direction for the Faraday effect, and in the (x,y) plane, but directed along the 
x-axis, for the Voigt effect. For these cases the relative permittivity tensors are [4]

in  which  n   is  the  magnetic  field-independent  refractive  index  of  the  magneto-optical 
material  and  it  is  assumed  that  all  the  diagonal  elements  are  equal.  This  is  not  literally 
correct, for materials like YIG, for example, but it is a very good approximation [3]. The 
magnetisation distribution created by the applied magnetic field is given by the factor  Q .

≈Q

For magnetic insulators like YIG, 
and is often treated as a constant proportional 
to the magnitude of the applied magnetic field. In practice, the application of an external 
magnetic field can be provided by an electrode structure [1-6] that has varying degrees of 
complexity. This structure can be placed directly, or even grown, upon the waveguide , or 
placed in its near neighbourhood. Through this structure an electric current flows and the 
result  is  an  inhomogeneous  magnetisation  distribution  that  makes  Q   a  function  of  the 
spatial coordinates. A simple electrode structure is a single wire carrying a current I, as 
shown in Fig.1. 
 
 
 
If  the  wire  lies  along  the  z-axis  then  the  magnetic  field  component  that  creates  the 
magnetisation will be a vector that is tangential to circles in the(
,x y  plane, centred upon 
the wire. There are then components of the magnetisation parallel to the x- and y-axes but 
only the one parallel to the x-axis will be important because the components along y will 
give rise to a polar magnetic effect. The latter will cause TE-TM coupling but since the 
phase matching condition is not met in this type of guide, with its large birefringence the 
effect  is  entirely  negligible.  This  investigation  will  adopt  this  method  of  supplying  an 
external field and all the models introduced below will assume that

spatial soliton beam, the x- and y-directions can be measured in units of the natural beam 
width 
.  Also, in a planar waveguide structure, only x will come into play, but both x 
and y will feature in vortex propagation as a 2D entity in the bulk. For guided waves, in 
the structure displayed in Fig.1, both TM and TE waves will be coupled in the Faraday 
configuration and phase matching might have to be addressed. It is removed here but it is 
not  unreasonable  to  address  this  kind  of  “form”  birefringence  experimentally  through 
some applied phase compensation, perhaps by making the applied field periodic. In the 
bulk this problem does not arise. The z-axis is scaled in diffraction, or Rayleigh, lengths 
that are defined as

Such terms do not scale in the same way as the leading Q term in the rest of the equations 
so  they  can  be  neglected.  A  typically  modest  value  of  Q  is

enhanced  by  at  least  an  order  of  magnitude  by  using  doped  YIG  for  example  [1-6,10].

and the x and y wave number components are equal. Thus, for this example, an arbitrarily 
polarised input to a Faraday system evolves, in the linear case, as uncoupled counter-
rotating, circularly polarised waves.  Equation (4) is sufficient to describe 2D vortex 
motion and by dropping down to 1D can be used to study phase-matched operations in a 
waveguide.

This equation only reaches this form after an arbitrary transformation of the amplitudes.    
However, the length scales are the same for both magneto-optic configurations, so scaling 
the amplitudes in a slightly different way in each case [14] can have no effect upon the 
solitons evolution patterns. In other words, the details of the amplitude transformations is 
unimportant  because  all  the  control  of  the  solitons  behaviour  will  be  exercised  through 
the parameters that have now been introduced. 
   Specifically,  αis  a  measure  of  the  linear  damping,  β  represents  the  possibility  of

through the data, later on, to give published [15-17] starting points that will be used to 
assess the effect of the applied magnetic field distribution.  For a study of magneto-optic 
vortex solitons, equation (8) will be used as it stands and is interpreted as propagation in 
a 2D bulk medium of circularly polarised modes within a Faraday configuration. Using

the modal structure must be made. In both the Faraday and Voigt cases, however, 
and the both the scaling transformations supply a factor of  O(104). Hence the 
 factor 
1Q
will be of a similar order of magnitude in both cases and will always have a significant 
influence.  The  earlier  elegant  discussions  of  cubic-quintic  dissipative  solitons  [15-18] 
have  shown  already  that  it  is  possible  to  generate  significantly  distinct  classes  of 
solutions in the absence of any magneto-optic effect, so the introduction of nonreciprocal 
behaviour  through  an  applied  magnetic  field  should  dramatically  alter  the  solitons 
behaviour. It is important to emphasise that 
 is the same order of magnitude in each 
 in the Voigt case involves a modal averaging factor arising 
application, even though 
from  the  guiding  in  the  asymmetric  planar  structure.  This  modal  factor  is  the  order  of 
unity and will “switch off” 

 if the waveguide is symmetric.

III.  Lagrangian Analysis 
 
   The  study  of  solitons  dynamics  can  often  be  based  upon  variational  theory.  Any 
analytical  progress  depends  upon  the  adoption  of  the  average  variational  method  first 
introduced by Whitham [19,20]. It centres upon the use of an average Lagrangian density 
and the inevitable introduction of trial functions. Whitham points out that the variational 

 

6

approach  is  not  a  separate  method  and  that  it  permits  the  development  of  quite  general 
results but naturally the accuracy of any description must depend upon a judicious choice 
of  trial  functions.  For  the  dissipative  cubic-quintic  system  considered  here,  the 
Lagrangian density is 

where  the  complex  amplitude  function 

,ψ x z   is  just  a  function  of  x  and  z.  Whitham 

showed that

 is the averaged Lagrangian[19-24].  

 
where 
 
 Powerful  applications  of  this  have  been  made  to  conservative  systems  [21-24]  that  are 
free of absorption and gain but, even if there is simple linear gain, a transformation can 
be made that reduces the problem once again to the familiar form used for conservative 
systems. It is necessary, therefore, to extend the reasoning behind the application of the 
Whitham  average  Lagrangian  procedure,  in  order  to  make  it  applicable,  in  principle,  to  
the complex Ginzburg-Landau cubic-quintic dissipative models.  
In the absence of gain or absorption, the conservative gyroelectric Lagrangian density is

It  is  equally  valid,  however,  to  generate  the  envelope  equation  from  the  complex 
conjugate  of  (12).  Hence  in  the  case  arising  because  of  the  presence  of  absorption  and 
gain,  and  any  other  non-conservative  processes,  the  full  functional  variation  of  the 
conservative Lagrangian density L  should be used. This variation, by definition, is

This  step  can  now  be  taken  further  by  progressing  to  the  use  of    L,  the  average 
conservative Lagrangian, by first of all adopting  a trial function ψT  that has z-dependent 
parameters. The latter will be properties of the solitons, such as amplitude (f1), width (f2), 
velocity(f3),  position(f4)  ,  phase  (f5),  or  indeed  any  other  feature  that  needs  to  be 
emphasised.  For  a  conservative  system,  the  average  Lagrangian  is  used  with  Euler-
Lagrange  equations  that  are  modified  to  be  a  variation  with  respect  to  the  z-dependent 
parameters fj,  i.e.

suitable  trial  function.  This  result  is  identical  to  other  formulations  [25-27]  for  non-

approach with the exact simulations for the gyroelectric investigations in hand. 
   

The choice of trial function is complicated by the fact that a number of distinctive classes

Voigt configuration 
 
This is a 1D case and it is sketched in Fig.1, where it is shown that magneto-optic control 
can be achieved through the application of an electric current I. The latter is carried by a 
x±  
simple  wire  that  produces  a  magnetic  field  that  quickly  drops  to  zero  in  the 
directions. This arrangement is designed to create an inhomogeneous magnetic field that 
saturates the magnetization under the wire and falls away from that value along each x-
direction. Typically a material like (LuNdBi)3(FeAl)5O12  on a Gd3Ga5O12 substrate can 
be  used  [3]  for  the  magneto-optic  component  and  some  form  of  gain/loss  material 
exhibiting a cubic-quintic nonlinearity is used to support the spatial solitons. To proceed 
is  required  to  apply  a  magnetic  field  influence  upon  the

observed magnetization versus magnetic field behaviour of magnet-optic materials. Since

wire  has  a  finite  thickness  but  that  only  serves  to  broaden  the  x-distribution  of  the 
magnetic  field,  so  for  simplicity  the  wire  will  be  assumed  to  be  infinitely  thin  in  the 
examples reported here. Directly under the wire, the magnetic field is H=I/(2 π d), where 
d  is  the  waveguide  thickness,  and  at  some  distance  down  the  x  axis  the  field  is

 reverses sign as the current direction reverses. In Fig.1 the current flows 

along the negative z axis to provide a magnetic field pointing along the positive x-axis. 
Hence the current flow is in the opposite direction to the propagation direction, which is 
along  +z.  The  applied  electric  current  is  measured  in  mA  and  x  and  d  are  measured  in

(A) periodic breathing  
 
There  are  several  interesting  cases  that  emerge  from  the  work  of  Akhmediev  and  co-
workers  [13-17]  so  the  data  sets  they  adopted  will  be  adhered  to  here  so  that  reference 
points  can  be  established  before  the  magnetic  field  is  introduced.  One  of  the  outcomes 
form  the  cubic-quintic  complex  Ginzburg-Landau  model  is  the  appearance  of  pulsating 
solitons that engage in periodic breathing [17]  as  they  propagate.  As  pointed  out  in  the 

 

10

literature [13], this dynamical system can be elegantly represented by constructing a 2D 

plot of

(0, z)

 , the intensity at x=0, versus the energy

along the z-axis. This treatment of the dynamical system produces a kind of limit cycle 
that will be displayed below. 
 
The  first  simulation  studies  the  behaviour  of  beams  that  are  super  Gaussian  or  sech- 
shaped at the input plane. The initial beams have the shapes:

As expected, the Gaussian beam exhibits some significant early transient behaviour, until 
the  final  breathing  form  is  achieved.    For  an  initial  sech-type  input  the  final  state  is 
reached  more  rapidly.  Fig.2  shows  these  features  in  parts  (a)  and  (d)  that  represents 
soliton development in the absence of an applied magnetic field. For each type of input 
“breathing” is in a periodic manner. The role of the magnetic field is introduced through 
the 
  term  and  Figs.  2(b),(e)  are  evidence  of  what  happens  when  I=200mA  >  0 

and    Q

>  0,  in  which  case  the  self-focusing  is  deepened.  For  the  sech  input  the 

periodicity is suppressed by the magnetic field. If the input excitation is a super-Gaussian 
there  is  an  initial  attempt  by  the  beam  to  maintain  some  pulsation  but  eventually  the 
magnetic field prevails, and a narrow self-focussed stationary state is developed. For I < 0 
 < 0,  the defocusing is exacerbated and in both the cases shown in Figs.2(c),(f) 
, 

1Q

x( )

the beam spreads significantly over a relatively short propagation distance. These results 
show  that  this  system  is  impressively  non-reciprocal.  Fig.3  shows  the  x=0  intensity 
versus energy plane. For zero applied field, and a sech input, there is a closed loop and 
the points will keep on repeating themselves i.e. they will always lie upon this loop. In 
this sense it can be called a cycle. Upon the application of the kind of applied magnetic 
field  distribution  defined  earlier,  a  well-defined  stationary  state  is  created  for  I  >0  and 
this  is  represented  by  a  single  point  on  Fig.3(a).  For  I  <  0  the  plot  degenerates  to  a 
straight  line  which  is  implied  by  Fig.  2((c).  For  a  super-Gaussian  input,  there  is  also  a 
closed loop for I = 0 but for I > 0 a spiralling path is taken, until a limit point is reached 
that  represents  the  stable  solution.  This  is  another  way  to  illustrate  the  non-reciprocal 
nature of the system in the presence of the magnetic field.

(B) soliton explosions 
 
 If  the  parameters  are  changed  yet  again  to  the  set  recommended  in  the  literature  [17] 
another fascinating outcome is revealed and displayed in Fig.4. For both sech and super-

Gaussian  inputs  remarkable  phenomena  have  been  discussed  [13]  in  which  the  solitons 
are formed but they then explode at regular intervals as they progress down the z-axis and 
yet  they  reconstitute  themselves  between  the  explosions.  The  effect  of  an  applied 
magnetic field upon this type of behaviour is shown. For I >0 the behaviour is very much 
like the I = 0 case because the self-focussing is being enhanced. There is a slight effect of 
the applied field because the effective potential well has been altered, which causes the 
solitons to “wobble” slightly. For I < 0 the defocusing is enhanced but nevertheless for 
this set of parameters the explosive pattern is still maintained even though they are now 
less  frequent  as  the  excitation  passes  along  the  z-axis.  Here  there  is  some  evidence  of 
radiation due to the defocusing nature of the magnetic field influence. 
 
 
(C) chaos 

 

Figure  5  shows  how  chaotic  behaviour  can  ensue  for  a  certain  set  of  parameters  and 
confirms  even  more  graphically  how  rich  the  behaviour  of  solitons  is  for  the  complex 
Ginzburg-Landau equation. This chaotic behaviour has been carefully investigated in the 
absence  of  magneto-optic  effects  [13-18].  If  the  applied  field  is  zero  clearly  defined, 
chaotic effects occur and this would be expressed on the dynamical 2D figure as a dense 
set of tracks that “wander about” within a closed region. The first thing to notice about 
the  magnetic  field  action  is  that  when  I  >  0  the  system  breaks  up  into  a  truly  chaotic 
pattern. Reversing the current direction permits the defocusing to take hold and the beam 
spreads out very dramatically. For this set of parameters the role of the magnetic field is 
to produce a highly non-reciprocal behaviour which should have device potential. 
 

(D) Lagrangian numerical analysis 
 
The variational method will now be used to determine if the behaviour of solitons in the 
complex Ginzburg-Landau cubic-quintic equation will yield useful results. Two cases are 
selected  as  examples  to  demonstrate  how  well  the  Lagrangian  works  and  these  focus 
upon moving solitons and breathing solitons. For the moving solitons the aim is to use the 
applied magnetic field to control solitons previously classified [15] as “moving”, in the 
sense that they moving at a finite velocity with respect to their frame of reference, so that 
the  parameter  set  adopted  is 
.  In  the  case 
=
presented  here  the  beam  is  located  at  x=-5  and  the  current  wire  is  place  at  x=10,  the 
current is I=200mA > 0. For this situation the solitons should see itself as being trapped 
into the potential well created by the magnetic field. This exactly what happens and the 
beam moves into a path dictated by the position of the current wire. This is clearly seen in 
Fig  6  where  it  is  shown  that  the  Lagrangian  dynamics  reproduce  the  full  simulation 
behaviour very well.   
Fig. 6 (a) shows that the beam becomes trapped in the neighbourhood of the wire and has 
been prevented from becoming established in the region that is accessible when 
For I< 0 the soliton is unable to cross the potential region because the latter will act as a 
barrier. This is precisely shown in Fig  6 (b).

(E) Faraday configuration: Optical vortices 
 
Retaining  equation  (8)  in  its  2D  form  enables  it  to  be  used  for  the  study  of  optical 
vortices. Since these will propagate in the bulk the basic equation represents a circularly 
polarised  beam 
like  semimagnetic

in 
semiconductors. The initial excitation is

. Fig.9 shows that the action of the magnetic field is to transform the 

vortex  into  a  bright  pair  of  solitons.  Fig.8  shows  the  input  vortex  and  its  phase 
distribution  that  reveals  how  the  phase  jumps  by  2π  as  a  circuit  is  made  around  the 
centre. The parameter Q1 is only a function of x so there is a peak in this function that lies 
along the y-axis. This axis marks out therefore a potential well that bright spatial solitons 
can populate. As seen in Fig.7, this is precisely what happens and the vortex breaks down 
into  two  bright  spatial  solitons  of  opposite  phase  and  they  populate  the  y-axis.  For  the 
reversed  direction  of  magnetic  field  the  y-axis  becomes  a  potential  hill  and  the  vortex 
breaks down into two bright solitons that reside on either side of it. 

 Conclusions 

 
V. 
 
This  paper  addresses  the  issue  of  how  an  applied  magnetic  field  influences  dissipative 
solitons. Two well-known configurations are adopted, namely the Voigt and the Faraday 
system. To consider the Voigt case, an asymmetric waveguide is created in which there is 
a nonlinear layer attached to a magnetooptic substrate. It is discovered that dramatic non-
reciprocity is achieved by providing an inhomogeneous magnetic field distribution of the 

  

 

 

 

13

kind  that  can  be  supplied  through  a  carefully  chosen  electrode  structure.  Some  well- 
known  data  sets  for  the  excitation  of  classes  of  dissipative  solitons,  using  a  complex 
Ginzburg-Landau cubic-quintic model are adopted. This means that soliton solutions that 
come  under  the  headings  pulsating,  exploding  and  chaotic  are  investigated.  It  is 
demonstrated that the role of the magnetic field is to create enhanced potential wells or 
barriers  and  that  this  feature  rapidly  encourages  self-focusing,  or  self-defocusing.  A 
variational method is established for this non-conservative system and it is shown that the 
dynamical  equations  are  in  excellent  agreement  with  the  full  simulations.  Finally,  a 
modest  investigation  into  vortex  propagation  is  presented  in  which  it  is  shown  that  the 
externally applied magnetic field distribution causes an elementary vortex to dissolve into 
a pair of bright solitons that position themselves with respect to the potential created.

Fig  1.  This  shows  the  kind  of  asymmetric  waveguide  structure  needed  to  ensure  that  the  Voigt  effect  is  O(Q),  as 
opposed to O(Q2) in the bulk or for a symmetric waveguide. It consists of a nonlinear layer that will support spatial 
solitons and the substrate is a magneto-optic insulator with its magnetisation stimulated by a wire carrying a current I.

curve corresponds to I=0mA, blue corresponds to I=200mA and the magenta curve to I=-200mA. The dissipative 
parameters are the same as those used in figure 2.  Note that there are two different scales in each plot and the 
change points are designated by //.

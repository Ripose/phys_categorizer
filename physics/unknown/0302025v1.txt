Radiation  appearing  when  relativistic  charged  particles  moves  along  a  periodic  structure  without  external  fields  is  investigated.  It  is 
shown  that  nonsynchronous  spatial  harmonics  of  wakefields  excited  by  bunched  charged  particles  can  give  rise  to  the  particle  oscillatory 
motion  that  consequently  generates  the  undulator-type  radiation  (UR). A theory of the undulator-type radiation emitted by ultrarelativistic 
charged  particles  in  the  self-wakefields  is  given.  An  analytical  expression  for  the  spontaneous  UR  power  of  the  ultrarelativistic 
monochromatic  charged  bunch  moving  in  a  weakly  corrugated  axially-symmetrical  waveguide is derived by the perturbation method. The 
parameter region, a particle number and particle energies at which the spontaneous UR power exceeds the wakefield power is analyzed.  

 
1. As is known, a charged particle bunch moving with a constant velocity along a periodic structure emits the 
Cherenkov-type radiation (or the diffraction radiation) [1]. The fields of this radiation called wakefields can be 
expressed  as  a  spatial  harmonic  series  according  to  the  Floquet’s  theorem.  Action  of  the  synchronous  spatial 
harmonics of the wakefield on the particles results in energy losses associated with the Cherenkov-type radiation. 
As is well known, the nonsynchronous spatial harmonics do not contribute to an energy change of a beam on the 
average  over  the  structure  period  D.  However  under  certain  conditions,  the  nonsynchronous  spatial  harmonics 
give  rise  to  the  oscillatory  motion  of  the  particles  with  a  time  period  equal  to  the  flight  time  of  the  structure 
period.  That,  consequently,  can  provide  the  generation  of  the  undulator-type  radiation.  This  radiation  is  the 
subject of discussion in this article.  

2. At the beginning we will consider the radiation of a self-oscillating point charge in the periodic structure 
[2]. As a periodic structure, we choose the vacuum corrugated waveguide with a metallic surface. Such structures 
are commonly used in rf linacs. Let a particle having the ultrarelativistic velocity v, the charge e and the mass m 
moves  along  the  structure  with  the  period  D.  The  longitudinal  component  of  the  velocity  vz,  parallel  to  the 
structure axis, is very close to the velocity of light с. The radiation reaction force and the radiation power have to 
be found.  

Using the Hamilton’s method developed in Ref. [3] we can obtain the radiation reaction force as

ωλ < с/r0  [3].  Vtot=MVcell,  here  we  assume  that  the  structure  contains  M→∝    cells  of  a  volume  Vcell  and  is 
enclosed  in  a  “periodicity  box”.  Аλ(r)  is  the  set  of  the  eigenfunctions  of  the  vector  potential  which  can  be 
represented in the Floquet form [1]

The  set  of  eigenfunctions  of  Eq.(2)  for  the  infinitely  long  periodic  waveguide  is  physically  limited  in 
frequency by the value of the electron plasma frequency ωре in the metal. As is known, if ωλ∼ωре, the conduction 
of metal walls strongly falls off, and the diffraction conditions in the periodic structure are disrupted. So, in the 
spectral region ωλ > ωре, where the wave diffraction can be neglected, the periodic waveguide can be considered 
as a free space. In this part of the frequency spectrum, the vector potential is sought as an expansion in terms of

The wake force (6) is the periodic function of time with the period D/v0. The synchronous harmonic of the

If  a  charged  particle  moves  off-axis,  it  experiences  the  action  of  the  transverse  component  of

Eq.(8) shows that the radiation manifests itself in the interference between the Cherenkov-type radiation and 

the udulator-type radiation in the region ωλ << ωре. 

For the region ωλ > ωре it is interesting to consider the radiation emitted by a high-energy charged particle 
satisfying the condition ωре<<2Ωγ2. Inserting Eqs.(8) and (3) into Eq.(1) and in analogy with Eq.(9) we obtain 
the power of the pure undulator-type radiation in the dipole approximation kλδr⊥(t)<<2π

where  the  number  of  harmonics  in  the  sum  is  limited  by  the  condition  of  the  smallness  of  the  oscillation 
amplitude resulting in p<<plim=2πγ ⁄max{α(p)}.  

As follows from Eq.(10) the power grows as a square of the particle energy, so in the region ω >> ωре the 

pure UR power can exceed the CR power emitted in the band ω << ωре. 

3. It should also be stated that, if the bunch of N electrons moves in the periodic structure and its longitudinal 
and  transverse  dimensions σz  and σ⊥  satisfy  the  conditions σz<<D/(2qγ2)  and σ⊥<<D/(2qγ),  respectively,  then 
the radiation with the frequencies ω < 2qΩγ 2 would be coherent. Moreover, for the range ωре << ω < 2qΩγ2 the 
UR power would be proportional to N 4.

4.  For  obtaining  the  quantitative  values  of  the  UR  power  let  us  consider  a  wakefied  excitation  by  a 
monochromatic bunch of charged particles which moves in a weakly corrugated axially symmetrical waveguide 
with perfectly conducting walls. The periodic waveguide radius can be represented in the Fourier form

where ε(z) <<1 is the relative depth of the corrugation, b0 is the average radius of the waveguide. 

We  solve  the  given  task  by  the  perturbation  method  which  was  expounded  in  [4].  The  essential  of  this 
approach is to replace boundary conditions for the electric field n×E=0, and magnetic field ∂B⁄∂n=0 (n is the 
normal  to  the  waveguide  surface)  at  r = b(z)  by  the  appropriate  conditions  on  the  values  of  Ez  and  ∂Bz 
⁄∂r  at 
r = b0. These new conditions can be expressed in terms of the functions b(z) and db(z)/dz containing the small 
parameter εp. We will find the nonsynchronous harmonics of a traverse wake force which act on the bunch as 
wave pumping. At the start, following Ref. [4], we find the fields created by a point charge of N electrons. Using 
the  Maxwell’s  equations  the  transverse  components  of  the  fields  are  expressed  in  terms  of  the  longitudinal 
components  which  satisfies  the  wave  equations  (see  Eq.(1.18)  and  (1.19)  in  Ref.  [4]).  The  wave equations are 
solved by the perturbation method representing the fields in the form of an expansion in terms of the powers of 
the small parameter εp. 

The first order amplitude of the рth spatial harmonic of the transverse force acting on the charge е having the 
transverse  coordinates  r,  ϕ  and,  at  the  distance  v0τ,  followed  after  the  point  charge  eN  with  the  transverse 
coordinates r=rb and ϕ=0, is given by

5.  Let  us  consider,  as  an  example,  the  sinus-type  corrugated  waveguide  with 

  at 
2ε1 = 0.1 and b0 = D. To estimate the maximal magnitudes of the UR power we choose the distance of the bunch 
from  the  waveguide  axis  at  the  level  of  rb ⁄b0= 0.9.  We  will  consider  two  variants.  In  the  first  variant  an 
ultrarelativistic electron bunch, typical for SLAC [5] with lb = 500 µm and N = 4×1010, interacts with the periodic 
structure of millimeter dimensions b0 = D = 3 mm. In the second variant all sizes of the structure and the bunch 
are reduced in ten times, so that: b0 = D = 0.3 mm; lb = 50 µm.

In Fig.1 represented are the dependences of the spontaneous UR power (lines 1 and 2) on the energy bunch 
and  the  similar  dependences  of  the  power  loss  associated  with  exciting  the  wakefield  (lines  1'  and  2').  The 
numbers 1, 1' correspond to the first variant and the numbers 2, 2' relate to the second variant. In the calculation 
we have taken into account the contribution of 120 resonance modes to the wakefield. As seen from Fig.1 there is 
the electron energy above of which the undulator-type radiation power exceeds the power loss associated with 
exciting  the  wakefield.  The  undulator-type  radiation  predominates  at  energies  above  6.4 TeV  for  the  first  case 
(the millimeter structure) and higher than 80 GeV for the second variant (the submillimeter structures).

Fig.2 represents the dependences of the number of electrons in the bunch on their energy. In the region of N 
and  mc2γ  parameters,  these  dependences  determinate  the  limit  above  of  which  the  spontaneous  UR  power 
exceeds the power of the wakefield excitation, PUb > Pwf. The lines 1 and 2 correspond to the variants 1 and 2 
respectively.  

6. In conclusion it should be noted that the undulator-type radiation power is proportional to γ  2. So, in the 
future  high-energy  electron  rf  linacs,  in  view  of  a  natural  beam  deviation  from  the  linac  axis,  because  of  the 
coherent betatron oscillation in a focussing system, the interaction of electrons with the spatial nonsynchronous 
harmonics of both an accelerating field [6] and a wakefield may result in the electron energy loss associated with 
the spontaneous undulator-type radiation.  

Note, also, that the new radiation mechanism considered above can be used in undulators based on periodic 
structures without external fields, where the nonsynchronous wake-harmonics of an electron bunch act as wave 
pumping. These wakefield undulators require no magnetic fields or rf sources needed in present-day FEL. The 
development  of  such  wakefield  undulators  with  submillimeter  periods  may  open  the  new  possibilities  for 
generating X rays without employing external periodic fields.

discussions and also to M.I.Ayzatsky, E.V. Bulyak, A.N.Dovbnia, V.F.Zhyglo and V.A.Kushnir for the series of 
valuable remark.

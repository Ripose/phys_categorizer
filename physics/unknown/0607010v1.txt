One  of  the  popular  mechanisms  of  the  freak  waves  phenomenon  is  the  dispersive  focusing  of 

transient  wave  groups.  In  all  published  theoretical  and  experimental  papers  the  surface  gravity 

waves are considered as an ensemble of free waves. This paper reports on a series of experiments 

conducted in the large wind-wave tank of IRPHE (Marseille – Luminy) to study the wind effect on 

the  generation  of  freak  waves.  A  suitable  theory  is  presented  to  explain  and  discuss  the 

experimental results. 

 

1.  Introduction 

Freak  wave  phenomenon  is  now  explained  by  many  physical  theories:  dispersive  and 

geometrical focusing, nonlinear modulational instability (Benjamin – Feir instability), wave-

current  and  wave-bottom  interactions;  see,  for  instance  (Olagnon  and  Athanassoulis,  2001; 

Rogue  Waves,  2003;  Kharif  and  Pelinovsky,  2003).  In  all  published  theoretical  and 

experimental papers the gravity waves on sea surface are assumed to be an ensemble of free 

waves. In early stages the wind flow is considered as the source of the spatial and temporal 

inhomogeneity  of  the  wind  wave  field  or  as  the  factor  of  wave  amplification.  The  present 

paper reports on a series of experiments with transient wave groups under wind action up to 

10 m/s conducted in the large wind-wave tank of IRPHE (Marseille – Luminy). Theoretical 

model  to  explain  the  experimental  results  is  developed.  It  includes  the  sub-surface  current 

induced by wind. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with experimental results. 

2. Set-up and experimental conditions 

The experiments have been conducted in the large wind-wave tank of IRPHE at Marseille -  

Luminy  (Figure  1).  It  is  constituted  of  a  closed  loop  wind  tunnel  located  over  a  water  tank 

40m long, 1 m deep and 2.6 m wide. The wind tunnel over the water flow is 40 m long, 3.2 m 

wide and 1.6 m high. The blower allows to produce wind speeds up to 14 m/s and a computer-

controlled wave maker submerged under the upstream beach can generate regular or random 

waves  in  a  frequency  range  from  0.5  hz  to  2  Hz.  Particular  attention  has  been  taken  to 

simulate pure logarithmic mean wind profile with constant shear layer over the water surface. 

A trolley installed in the test section allows to locate probes at different fetches all along the 

facility.  The  water  surface  displacements  were  determined  by  using  three  capacitive  wave 

gauges  of  0.3  mm  outer  diameter  with  DANTEC  model  55E  capacitance  measuring  units. 

Two wave gauges was located at fixed fetches of 1m and 3 m from the uspstream beach. A 

third  wave  gauge  was  installed  on  the  trolley  in  order  to  determine  the  water  surface 

deflections η at various distances from the upstream beach. The typical sensitivity of the wave 

probes was of order of 0.6 V/cm. 

 

Figure 1: A schematic representation of the Large Air-Sea Interactions Facility. 

For each value of the mean wind speed, W equals to 0, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 m/s, the water surface 

deflections η was measured at 1 m fetch and at different fetches between 5m and 35 m. The 

wave maker was driven by an analog electronic signal varying linearly with time from 1.3 Hz 

to  0.8  Hz  in  10  seconds  with  constant  amplitude  of  displacements  corresponding  to  nearly 

constant amplitude of the initial wave group. The fetch values are taken from the entrance of 

the wave-tank, where the airflow meets the water surface i.e. at the end of the upstream beach. 

Typical value of σ equal to the rms of the water deflections η determined at the distance 1 m 

for different wind speeds is 1.87-1.88 cm.  

3. Experimental Results 

Figure 2 demonstrates the focusing of the free transient wave groups when there is no wind 

flow  above  waves.  Initial  wave  packet  has  the  step-wise  amplitude  modulation  and  linearly 

frequency  modulation.  As  predicted  by  the  linear  theory  of  the  free  deep-water  waves,  the 

waves focused at a precise distance, leading to the occurence of a high amplitude freak wave. 

Downstream  of  the  point  of  focusing,  the  amplitude  of  the  group  decreases  rapidly 

(defocusing). The influence of the wind flow with speed 6 m/s on the wave focusing process 

is  shown  in  Figure  3.  The  characteristics  (frequencies  and  amplitude)  of  the  initial 

mechanically  generated  waves  are  kept  the  same.  As  it  can  be  seen,  the  scales  of  spatial  - 

temporal evolution of the group are changed with wind. For each value of the wind speed, the 

amplification  ratio  A(X,W)  can  be  defined  as  A  =  ηmax/σ,  where  ηmax  is  the  maximum 

amplitude  of  the  wave  packet  on  fixed  distance.  Figure  4  gives  the  amplification  ratio  as  a 

function of the distance from the upstream probe located at 1 m fetch and for different values 

of the wind speed. This figure shows that in presence of wind, we observed a freak wave of a 

larger  amplitude,  occuring  at  a  longer  distance  than  observed  without  wind.  Moreover, 

contrarely to the case without wind, the freak waves maintains its coherency and its amplitude 

as it propagates downstream the previous focusing point. The effects of wind on the location 

of the focusing point, on  the amplitude and the coherency of the freak wave increases as the 

wind velocity increases.

Results  of  the  wavelet  analysis  of  time  series  of  the  surface  elevation  at  3  m  and  25  m  for 

wind speed 8 m/s are presented in Figure 5. These figures show the time frequency evolution 

of  the  group  as  it  propagates  downstream  along the  wave  tank.  As  it  can  be  seen,  the  wind 

generated ripples have other frequencies than the transient group.

Clearly  Figure 5 shows the wind waves are damped by the freak wave. This result is of the 

first importance for remote sensing. 

4. Focusing of narrow-banded wave groups  

The  dynamics  of  narrow-banded  linear  wave  packets  can  be  described  by  the  parabolic 

equation for wave amplitude

where k0 and ω0 are the wave number and frequency of the carrier wave, cgr = dω/dk is the 

group velocity. The wave amplitude, A, is a slowly varying function of x and t. 

Let us consider first the wave transformation of the wave packets with no wind. Transforming 

the variables into dimensionless form

Equation  (1)  or  (3)  are  widely  used  to  demonstrate  the  effect  of  the  wave  focusing  of  the 

linear  transient  groups  (Clauss  and  Bergmann,  1986;  Pelinovsky  &  Kharif,  2000;  Brown  & 

Jansen,  2001).  In  particular,  if  the  boundary  condition  (4)  corresponds  to  the  packet  with 

amplitude modulation of  gaussian shape 

 
in the process of the wave evolution its complex envelope is described by

It corresponds to the linear variation of the frequency with time in the wave packet. Adding 

the  carrier  frequency,  it  means  that  the  wave  packet  has  low  frequency  oscillations  on  the 

front  because  they  have  large  values  of  speed  propagation  (usual  action  of  the  frequency 

dispersion). 

If this wave packet is inverted in space (y → - y), it will represent a wave packet with high 

frequency waves on the front, which propagate slowly. Let the paddle generate such a wave 

packet, it means that the boundary condition (4) for complex amplitude, a(τ,0) is

The solution given above describes the evolution of a free transient group with the formation 

of a freak wave. Results of the comparison with experimental data are presented in Figure 6. 

We used the following parameters: Af = 3.8 m, f0 = 1 Hz and Ω0 = 0.062. In the case of no 

wind the agreement between theoretical and numerical results is quite good.

The next step is to include the wind effect. The wind leads to the wind increment and also the 

induced  flow.  As  it  is  known,  the  linear  part  of  the  any  evolution  equation  is  the  inverse 

Fourier  transformation  of  the  linear  dispersion  relation.  The  induced  flow  modifies  the 

dispersion relation which can be written as follows

Equation  (23)  was  investigated  earlier  and  we  may  use  the  previous  gaussian  solution  (by 

replacing the coefficients) to study the wind effect. First of all, some conclusions can be done 

before  any  procedures.  As  it  is  evident,  the  wind  increment  modifies  the  wave  amplitude 

providing  additional  growth  of  the  wave  field,  but  really  this  effect  is  not  important;  see 

Figure  5.  The  second  one  is  that  the  group  velocity  (dω/dk)  increases  with  the  current  and, 

therefore, the focal point will be shifted on large distance from the paddle. The third one is 

that  the  dispersion  parameter  (d2k/dω2)  decreases  with  the  current  and,  therefore,  the  wave 

amplitude  will  change  more  slowly  with  distance.  All  these  conclusions  correspond  to  the 

experimental data and may be illustrated by the gaussian solution again. If the wave envelope 

in the focal point is the gaussian pulse 

 
(now we use dimensional variables), the maximal amplitude will vary with distance as

Figure 7 shows the comparison with observed data for wind speed value 4 m/s. Here we used

is quite good.

However,  in  presence  of  wind,  the  assymetry  observed  on  the  curve  is  not  found  by  the 

model. Reul et al , 1999 have shown that  over a steep wave, air flow separation process can 

occur  inducing  large  local  enhancement  of  the  momentum  flux  from  wind  to  the  wave.  We 

therefore could suggest that this process could occur in the same manner over the rogue wave 

at and downstream the focusing point. This could maintain the freak as it propagates after the 

focusing point.

The  focusing  of  the  transient  wave  groups  under  a  wind  flow  action  has  been  investigated 

experimentally  and  theoretically.  It  is  shown  that  focal  distance  is  increased  as  well  as  the 

maximum wave amplitude in this point. This effect is explained by the kinematic (Doppler) 

effect in the dispersion relation in the framework of the parabolic equation.

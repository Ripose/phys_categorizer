This note deals with a multivariate stochastic approach to forecast the behaviour
of  a  cyclic  time  series.  Particular  attention  is  devoted  to  the  problem  of    the
prediction  of  time  behaviour  of  sunspot  numbers  for  the  current  23th  cycle.  The
idea  is  to  consider  the  previous  known  n  cycles  as  n  particular  realizations  of  a
given stochastic process. The aim is to predict  the  future  behavior  of  the  current
n+1th realization given a portion of the curve  and  the  structure  of  the  previous  n
realizations.  The  (linear)  model  derived  is  based  on  the  cross-correlations
between the current n+1th realization and the previous n ones and the solution of
the  related  least  squares  problem.  As  example  we  applied  the  method  to
smoothed monthly sunspots numbers from SIDC archives, in order to predict the
behaviour of the current 23th solar  cycle.

1. SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE METHOD

 A  cyclic  time  series,  independently  of  the  degree  of  complexity,  may  be
partizioned    in  n  subsets    according  to  its  main  cycle.  These  subsets  are
considered  as  n  different  realizations  of  a  given  stochastic  process.  In  this
approach  the  problem  of  forecasting  a  part  of  a  next  cycle  is  equivalent  to
estrapolate  a  reliable  behaviour  for  the  n+1th  stochastic  realization  from  the
known  structure  of  the  previous  n  realizations.    The  criteria  adopted  here  is  to
relate  the  known  part  of  the  n+1th  realization  with  the  equivalent  part  of  the  n
realizations. This allows the set up of a predictive model for the unknown part of
the  n+1th  realization.  More  precisely,  the  method  starts  with  the  computation  of

 This allows to derive 1) the degree of correlation of the known part of the n+1th
realization  with  the  previous  n  realizations  and  2)  the  related  optimal  lag  with
respect to the known part of the n+1th realization. This information is necessary to
set up an optimal  predictive model.

The linear model derived from the correlation analysis is of the form:

where    s  is  the  number  of  known  realizations  with  a  degree  of  cross-correlation
greater  than  a  defined  value.  The  set  of  coefficients    ck    is  evaluated  through  a
least squares problem using the known values of the n+1th realization.
This model is then utilized to predict the future behaviour of the n+1th realization.

2.  APPLICATION  TO  THE  SOLAR  CYCLE:  THE  SMOOTHED  MONTHLY
SUNSPOTS NUMBERS

As  application  of  the  above  method  we  considered  the  well  known  solar  cycle
through the time series of the smoothed monthly sunspots numbers (ssnm) from
the Sunspot Index Data Center (SIDC) of Brussels, Belgium [2]. As we know the
about 11 years solar cycle is evidenced in the whole complexity by the time series
of the sunspots numbers. The behaviour is charaterized by a very noisy data with
high  irregular  and  dispersive  cycles.  From  a  statistical  viewpoint  the  22  cycles
known are non-homogeneous and non-stationary. The accuracy of any predictive
model is then strongly affected by  these characteristics. The n=22 cycles are then
considered    as  known  realizations  of  the  underlying  stochastic  process.  At  the
present  we  know  only  the  first  26  values  of  the  ssnm  for  the  current  23th  cycle.
These values jointed with the known structure of the previous cycles allow the set-
up of a predictive model  based on cross-correlations functions. The basic idea is
to  handle  each  cycle  as  a  particular  realization  of  the  same  stochastic  process.

The  predictive  model  is  the  result  of  the  cross-correlations  existing  between  the
known  part  of  the  23th  cycle  and    the  remaining  cycles.  As  known,  the  time
extension of the 22 cycles is different and thus we have limited the analysis to the
first common 100 values from the evaluated minimum (dt=0.082 years). The result
of the correlation analysis was that only s=8 cycles are strongly correlated (R‡ 0.8)
with the known part  of  the  current  23th  cycle:  k=2,9,10,11,12,13,14,22.  Thus  the
model is formed by a proper linear combination of the related cycles. Next a least
squares problem was solved in order to determine the values of the unknown s+1
coefficients. The maximum relative error was about 10%. The model is then used
to predict the behaviour of the successive values of ssnm for the 23th cycle.
In Figure 1 we show the results. In particular, as indicated, the current prediction,
based on this approach, is that the next ssnm peak  will reach the value: 147.76 at
1999.89. A number of  computations on known cycles showed that the tendency
of  the  method  is  to  overestimate  the  peak.  We  stress  the  comparison  of    the
predicted cycle shape with the previous cycles. The high irregular and dispersive
level  of  the  previous  n  realizations  (both  in  phase  and  in  intensity)  forces  the
predicted  behaviour  to  be  very  unstable  and  subjected  to  significative  variations.
Of course, as new values  will be included in the current cycle, the analysis should
imply  more and more reliable predictions.

CONCLUSIONS

The  above  analysis  shows  a  possible  method  to  set-up  a  predictive  model  of
cyclic  time  series  based  on  a  multivariate  stochastic  approach.    Particular
attention is devoted to the problem of  the prediction of time behaviour of sunspot
numbers  for  the  current  23th  cycle.  The  basic  idea  is  to  consider  the  previous
known n cycles as n particular realizations of a given stochastic process. The aim
is to predict the future behavior of the current n+1th realization given a portion of
the curve and the structure of the previous n realizations. The quantitative results
are  consistent  with  other  predictive  methods  such  as  based  on  correlations  with
geomagnetic indices, rarm models, etc.

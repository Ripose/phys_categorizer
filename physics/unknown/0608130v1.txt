excitation

Coherent responses of resonance atom layer to short optical pulse excitation are numerically considered. 
The inhomogeneous broadening of one-photon transition, the local field effect, and the substrate disper-
sion are involved into analysis. For a certain intensity of incident pulses a strong coherent interaction in 
the form of sharp spikes of superradiation is observed in transmitted radiation. The Lorentz field correc-
tion and the substrate dispersion weaken the effect, providing additional spectral shifts. Specific features 
of photon echo in the form of multiple responses to a double or triple pulse excitation is discussed. 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

A film with a thickness of the order of a wavelength placed on an interface of two dielectric me-

dia  represents  a  simple  example  of  2D  system,  which  optical  properties  has  been  intensively 
studied1-6. A thin film physics is attributed by an account of dipole-dipole interaction7,8 in micro-

scopic field acting on resonance atoms. The remarkable result in this field was the prediction of 
optical  bistability1,9-13  and  the  feasibility  of  the  chaotic  pulsation  of  the  transmitted  radiation12. 

The most of studies of the short pulse refraction by such nonlinear interface were carried out un-

der the assumption that the atoms of a film were modeled by a two-level system in one-photon 

resonance with the incident radiation. Thus, a specific spatial synchronism of photon echo gener-
ated by a thin resonance layer on an interface was considered in14. The approaches worked out 

for  conventional  models  were  extended  to  another  low  dimension  system,  such  as  the  layer  of 
quantum dots15, film of three level atoms16,17 or thin film resonators filled with two-level medi-
um18, and another type of resonance, for instance, the two-photon resonance19,20  

The purpose of this work is to demonstrate by numerical modeling, how a thin layer attrib-

utes, such as local field effect, a very small thickness of the film, the inhomogeneous broadening 

of  resonance  transition  and  even  the  dispersion  of  substrate  material  (Section  1)  can  affect  the 

transmittance  of  layer  and  the  temporal  shape  of  transmitted  ultra-short  pulses  (Section  2),  in-
cluding  the  observation  of  the  photon  echo  effect  6,21,22  (Section  3).    It  turned  out  that  Lorentz 

field  correction  plays  important  role  in  film  structures,  causing  spectral  dynamical  shifts  of 

atomic system observable in strong coherent coupling of pulsed radiation with a film. 

 

1. A THIN FILM OF ATOMS ON AN INTERFACE 

Let a thin film of atoms interacting resonantly with the electromagnetic field of light wave lie on 

the layer along the interface of two dielectric media in the Х=0 plane. The dielectric media sur-

rounding  the  film  are  characterized  by  the  dielectric  permittivity 

aε   at 

x <

0

  and 

bε   at 

x >

0

. 

Axis Z is chosen in the plane of the interface. The resonance atoms are described by two-level 

model. The duration of the optical pulse is short in compare with polarization and population dif-

ference relaxation times, but at the same time, it is much longer than optical period. Therefore, 

the approximation of slowly varying complex amplitudes can be still applied. It is supposed that 

the thickness of the film l is of the order or less than the wavelength of resonant radiation l∼λ. 

Let the short pulse of the ТЕ-wave be incident on the interface from the x<0 side. The elec-

tromagnetic field vector  E  of such wave is orthogonal to the ZX plane for all x, i.e. the polariza-

tion vectors of the incident, refracted, and reflected wave are collinear to the Y axis:

lopes of the optical pulses and are exact.

To illustrate this, the variant of numerical simulation of (11) for a smooth step input pulse is 

depicted in Fig. 1(a). We neglect the substrate dispersion at this stage. It is seen that the weak 

pulse is almost totally reflected.  

If the amplitude of the exciting field is not too large, than the field is in resonance with the quan-

tum system and so the pulse is strongly reflected from the layer as it was discussed in a number 
of papers1,2,4. The exponential tails at the leading and the trailing edge of the pulse are the signals 

of free induction decay.  

The calculation run with the Lorentz factor  ≈α 1 revealed the role of the local field7 as the 

additional  detuning  causing  the  shift  from  resonance  and  the  loss  of  coherency.  That  leads  to 

practically total transparency of the film for pulse radiation (Fig. 1(a)).

All three cases are common in that the dynamics of transmission of short pulses is determined by

That means that a film of resonance atoms 

serves  as  a  mirror  for  the  long  weak 

pulses.  

In  other  cases  the  numerical  analysis 

seemed  to  be  more  adequate.  Each  point 

on  graphics  (Fig.  2)  is  the  result  of  solu-

tion of the whole system  (11) with a  sub-

sequent  integration  of  the  solution  over 

time.  The  pulse  shapes  for  the  final  pulse 

duration for each of three incoming ampli-

tude  in  Fig.  2(a,b,c)  are  depicted  on  the

reflection of a weak pulse (17). The transient regime (

=1.5) is featured by the oscillation of 

me

the transmittivity (Fig. 2(b)) due to the arising of new peaks on the temporal profile of a trans-

mitted pulse (Fig. 1(b)). The transparency of the resonance atom layer reaches the Fresnel limit 

0T  (Fig. 2(c)) and it does not practically alter with the energy growth when the amplitude of the 

input pulses is sufficiently large (Fig. 1(c)). 

C. Local field effect in coherent transmission 

Lorentz field contribution does have a noticeable effect only for weak and intermediate pulse 

amplitudes when the action of the external field and the Lorentz field correction can be com-

pared. Then the presence of the 

local field is accounted as an 

additional detuning, which 

drives the quantum system out 

from resonance. For a strong 

pulse excitation, the contribu-

tion of the local field effect is 

negligible (Fig. 1(c)).  

The  3D  plot  in  Fig.  3(a)  pre-

sents the evolution of the pulse 

of  medium  height  under  the 

sweep  of  detuning  δ  from  its 

negative  to  positive  values.  As 

it has been shown above, when 

the Lorentz field effect is weak 

(α< 1), the step pulse suffers a 

strong 

coherent 

interaction 

with  the  layer  accompanying 

by 

the  formation  of  sharp 

spikes  of  superradiation  (Fig. 

3(b))  with  a  remarkable  satel-

lite  spike  in  the  later  time  mo-

ments.

the subsequent growth of

of the blooming of resonance film by intensive peaks of radiation on the contour of transmitted 

field (see Figs. 1(c), 2(c)).

starts  earlier  at  negative  detun-

ing  and  the  region  of  coherent

(Fig.3(d))  as  new  peaks  appear 

every  time  the  total  detuning 

changes its sign (these moments 

are  marked  by  two  spots  in 

Fig.3(f.)). The enhancement of a 

local  field  effect  contribution 

apparently leads to the distortion

maximum (Fig. 3(e)).  

D. The effect of substrate dispersion 

The effect of substrate material dispersion strongly depends on the value and the sign of the 

dispersion  coefficients 

1T

  and 

2T

,  leading  to  a  form  distortion  (Fig.  4(a,b,e,f))  and  spectrum 

changing (Fig.5). The numerical simulation in this paragraph exhibits one certain realization of a 

dispersion effect from a set of possibilities. 

In Fig.4, which is analogus to Fig.3, the effect of substrate dispersion is presented for two cases 

when the local field effect is off (α=0) (Fig. 

4(a,b,c))  and  when  it  is  on  (α=1)  (Fig. 

4(d,e,f)). 

The region of resonance, where we drag 

the quantum system in by sweeping the de-

tuning δ, is getting wider due to the change 

of  spectrum  of  the  refracted  field.  The  co-

herent  interaction  of  field  with  the  film 

manifests in a sharp spike of transmitted ra-

diation  (Fig.  4(c))  in  the  vicinity  of  reso-

nance. 

The  layer  on  a  dispersive  substrate  be-

comes  dark  in  the  transmitted  light  (Fig. 

4(b)). With the including of local field effect 

(Fig. 4(d,e,f)) the population difference pro-

vides  the  dynamical  contribution  to  a  total 

detuning 

, making it the time depending

value  (Fig.  4(f))  and  provoking  a  spectrum 

distortion (Fig. 5). Consequently the tempo-

ral  profile  of  a  transmitted  field  gets  more

3. PHOTON ECHO IN A THIN FILM OF RESONANCE ATOMS 

The  photon  echo21  is  a  coherent  response  of  an  ensemble  of  quantum  resonance  systems 

(two- or more level atom) to by a series of ultra-short pulses. Photon echo arises at the moments 

multiple to time intervals between pulses as the result of phase synchronization of individual ra-

diators with detuning  x  comprising the inhomogeneous line. The latter process is represented by 

the averaging <…> in the set of basic equations (11). The difficulty in solving (11) is that the 

field which acts on atom 

loce τ  in its turn does depend on averaged polarizability 

xσ<

> , that 

( )

makes the problem self-consistent.  

So far there have been several approaches to resolve the problem by admitting the simplify-
ing suggestions2,6,18. We report the results of one more attempt to tackle the problem in full in-

cluding local field effect, inhomogeneous broadening and dispersion of substrate. Equations (11) 

were  solved  with  the  desired 

accuracy  by 

iterations  over 

field,  which  started  from  the 

field  entering  the  film.  The 

length of the Bloch vector was 

monitored  at  every  iteration 

step and at every point of time 

grid.  

In  Fig.  6(a)  effect  of  photon 

echo is depicted with parameter 

g   formally  equals  to  zero. 

That  corresponds  to  an  ap-

proximation of given field. The 

signal of primary echo is delec-

tated  in  polarization,  so  the 

field of a reciprocal reaction of 

resonance  medium  is  negligi-

ble.  The  picture  of  multiple

responses.  Note  that  the  length  of  Bloch  vector  averaged  over  the  spectral  line  keeps  constant 

(Fig. 6(c) dashed line). 

Additional spectral broadening due to substrate dispersion (Fig. 6(e)) acts in the same direc-

tion thus depleting the chain of multiple photon echoes. The population difference changes sig-

nificantly during the excitation and echo formation, as it is shown in Fig.6 (d). Fig. 6(f) demon-

strates the effect of three-pulse excitation attributed by generation of stimulated echo (se) in the 
appropriate moment22, as well as reconstructed echo22 (re), and echoes from the pairs of external 

pulses. This is a novel result in thin layer optics accounting the local field effect. The substrate 

dispersion effect for stimulated echo is trivially similar to that in Fig. 6(e). 

CONCLUSION 

In conclusion, the numerical analysis of coherent responses of resonance thin film to ultra-short 

optical pulse excitation is presented. The role of inhomogeneous broadening of resonance line, 

the local field effect and the substrate dispersion was demonstrated in both the temporal shape of 

transmitted wave and the integral transmission coefficient. There is a range of incoming ampli-

tudes  where  the  interaction  of  pulsed  light  with  the  quantum  system  leads  to  the  formation  of 

peaks  of  superradiation  in  transmitted  wave.  Photon  echo  effect  is  considered  without  conven-

tional simplification. It turns out that a film of resonance atoms is able to radiate multiple echo 

signals after the irradiation by two or more coherent pulses.

        Can  we  obtain  the  predictive  value  of  GP-B experiment from the known experimental results? 

This predictive value is more reliable then that deduced from special model of theory. In this paper, 
we calculate in this way. The result is same as that from special relativistic gravitational theory. So 

it is extremely likely that GP-B experiment will prove space-time is flat.

(1) The conclusion deduced from the results of three classical relativistic experiments 

The perihelion shift of planet and deflection of light are the problem of a body moves in the 

gravitational  field  due  to  a  static  sphere 

0M . The  experimental  result  of  the  perihelion  shift  of

according to the red shift experiment. The red shift of light is also the problem of a photon moves 

in the gravitational field in substance. Using the Einstein’s relation between energy and frequency 
nhw =

 and (3), we obtain that the variance of energy is 

if  a  body  moves  from 

r =

0

R

  (the  sun)  to 

»r

(the  earth).  (4)  is  the  another  form  of 

experimental result from red shift. 

What can we learn from these experimental results? 
From Newton gravity we obtain that, if a body moves in the field due to a static sphere, its 

variance of energy  wD

 and variance of angular momentum  LD

  are

respectively. Comparing (4) and (5), we obtain that, if a body moves in the field due to the static 
source, only the Newton gravity contributes to the variance of energy, but the set of (5) and (6) can 

not explain the perihelion shift of the planet and the deflection of light. So the only correct way is 
to suppose that, the gravity contains an additional term except the Newton’ term

l  From  the  experiment  of  red  shift,  only  the  Newton  gravity  is  to  do  work,  the 
additional  force  is  not  to  do  work,  so  the  direction  of  the  additional  force 
perpendicular to the velocity  u   of  the  exerted  body. 

l  The  direction  of  normal  line  of  the  orbital  plane 

  is  invariance  in  the

procedure of motion of the planet or photon. However the direction of Newton gravity 

is  perpendicular  to

u

also  perpendicular  to

. 

l  If  the  body  moves  in  the  gravitational  field  due  to  a  static  sphere,  analogy  to  the 

Newton  gravity,  the  additional  gravity  must  be  proportional  to  the  gravitational 

constant  G , the mass of static sphere 

0M , the mass of the exerted body  m ,  then 

the additional gravity is

l  All  of  the  gravitational  field  strength  satisfies  same  equation,  so  there  must  be  the 
same  factor  of  r   in  the  expression  of  each  component  of  field.  It  means  that  the 
2-r
additional  gravity  must  contain 
  factor  in  the  static  case.  In  addition,  the 
additional gravity has the same dimension as Newton gravity, therefore

where  l   is  a  quantity  with  non-dimension,  it  determines  the  strength  of  the  additional

We can make  an analogous calculation for the deflection of light. Comparing the theoretical 
. We get the same  l   value  from 
the motions of planet and photon, their velocities are extreme different. This fact means that, (10) 

value  with  the  experimental  value,  we  obtain  similarly

is reasonable. It is correct that the size of additional gravity is proportional to the second power of 
velocity, except a  m  factor. Substituting the value of  l   into  (10),  we  get

velocity.  This  formula  of  gravity  and  the  strengths  of  field  are  deduced  from  the  experimental 
results,  there  are  apart  from  the  specific  theoretic  model  of  gravity.  However  this  formula  of 

gravity is same as the special relativistic gravitational theory or general relativity. From (23), we

obtain  the  precession  of  gyroscope  of  orbital  effect  predicted  by  the  special  relativistic

ABSTRACT 

In this paper we optimize the experimental parameters to operate  a Free 

Electron Laser with a laser wiggler in the Angstrom region. We show that 

the  quantum  regime  of  the  Self  Amplified  Spontaneous  Emission 

(Quantum SASE) may be reached with realistic parameters. The classical 

SASE  regime is also discussed and compared with the quantum regime.

INTRODUCTION 

 

 

It has been shown that the quantum effects in a Free Electron Laser (FEL) are ruled by the quantum 

FEL  parameter 

r=r

)k/mc(

(cid:1)

  [1],  where    r

  is  the  classical  FEL  parameter  [2].  The  classical 

analysis is valid only for 

1>>

, whereas for 

1<r

 the quantum effects dominate [3,4]. In particular, 

in  the  quantum  Self  Amplified  Spontaneous  Emission  (SASE)  mode  operation,  the  quantum 

purification of the radiation spectrum has been predicted [3,4], i.e. the broad and chaotic spectrum 

predicted  in  the  classical  SASE    [5]  and  observed  experimentally  [6]  shrinks  to  a  very  narrow 

spectrum when  

1<<

.  

It has been suggested that a quantum SASE FEL could be constructed using a laser wiggler [7,8] in 

a  Compton  backscattered  configuration,  instead  of  the  static  wiggler  used  in  the  current  classical 

SASE experiments [6]. In a laser wiggler configuration, a low-energy electron beam back scatters

the photons of a counter-propagating high power laser, with a frequency up-shifted by a factor 4g 2. 

The use of a laser wiggler has been discussed in the past by Gallardo et al. [9] in a classical theory .  

In the following, we propose a way to optimize the experimental parameters for an X-ray FEL with 

a laser wiggler,  showing the main differences between the parameters necessary to operate in the 

classical  and  in  the  quantum  regimes.  The  analysis  shows  that  the  quantum  regime  appears,  in 

general,  more  feasible  than  the  classical  regime  for  the  state-of-art  of  electron  beams  and  lasers 

technology. We stress that only in the quantum SASE regime a temporally coherent X-ray source 

could  be  realized,  contrarily  than  in  the  classical  SASE  regime  whose  chaotic  spectrum  is 

temporally  incoherent.  Furthermore  it  is  clear  that  a  quantum  FEL  with  a  laser  wiggler  not  only 

would  be  coherent  but  two  or  three  orders  of  magnitude  smaller  in  size  (possibly  table-top)  and 

cost.  The  results  of  the  present  parametric  study  are  rather  encouraging  with  respect  to  a  future 

realization of a quantum SASE X-ray FEL source.

proportional  to 

3r

,  so  that,  going  from  the  quantum  to  the  classical  regime,  if  r

  increases  for 

instance by a factor 10, the current increases by a factor 103. This is the general reason why the use 

of a laser wiggler may be much more convenient in the quantum regime (

1<r

regime

The relation between 

0a  and  the laser power P, in agreement with [9], is 

where  R  is the minimum radius of the laser and P is in TW and  k  is 1 or  2  for a transversally 

gaussian (with beam section

respectively.  From eqs. (6) and (7), we obtain the important relation between the electron current

Since the interaction length  Lint, given by the time duration  t  of the laser pulse, is  approximately 

twice the Rayleigh range ZL of the laser, and requiring that it is larger than the gain length

From Eqs. (10) and (11), we obtain the following self-consistent value of the laser rms radius at the 

Note that the power gain length is half of the value given by (9). So, if for instance a1=5, then the 

interaction length is ten times the power gain length.  

Concerning the requirement on the emittance, a very important geometrical matching condition is 

the following 

(14)

where  n

 is the normalized beam emittance. Eq. (14) imposes that the electron beam is contained in 

the  laser  beam,  provided  s

  £ R,  and  that  the  electron  beam  does  not  diverge  appreciably  in  a 

Rayleigh range ZL. From Eqs. (11) and (14),  it follows:

This is the correct condition on the emittance to be satisfied in a laser wiggler, which becomes quite 

restrictive when

  where 

rZ  is the Rayleigh range of 

the  FEL  radiation,  so  that  the  emitted  radiation  would  get  outside  of  the  electron  beam,  making 

impossible the amplification process. To forbid this, we should reverse the criterion, i.e.

Up to now, all we have written is valid both in the classical and in the quantum regime. In both the

Emittance  is  one  of  the  causes  of  the  energy  spread  increasing.  In  fact,  since  the  resonance

We remark that the inequality (15) must be strictly satisfied, otherwise the FEL action is destroyed. 

The inequality (23) or (24) arises from an inhomogeneous broadening of the resonance which may 
reduce  the  emission  deteriorating  the  gain,  since  only  the  electrons  whose  q

  is  small  enough  will 

participate to the radiation process [11]. 

Another cause which may contribute to the broadening of the resonance is the intensity fluctuations 

in the laser wiggler, i.e.  the fluctuations in the  wiggler parameter a0. Using Eq. (1)  and imposing 

(18) we obtain, very simply,

CLASSICAL VERSUS QUANTUM REGIME 

In  order  to  discuss  some  specific  example  for  the  classical  and  the  quantum  regimes,  we  take  as 
r(Å), l L(m m), a0 (the wiggler parameter), 

independent the following system of six parameters:  r

laser  and  the  radiation  beam  radius  at  the  focal  point).  The  other  parameters  are  deduced  self-
consistently as follows. Using eq. (1) we deduce g . With eq. (9) we calculate Lg, with eq. (13) we 
deduce R and than s

 from (16). Introducing these values in eqs. (6), (7) and (12) we calculate the 

current  I,  the  power  P  and  the  total  energy  U.  Finally  we  calculate  the  limit  values  on  emittance 

from (17) and (23) and the number of photons from eqs. (29) and (30), for a given beam charge Q. 
In the table 1 we report the results of the optimization with l

r=2Å, l L=0.8 m m, a1=5 and a2=2, both 

for  a  quantum  case,  with 

2.0=r

  and  a0=0.1,  and  for  a  classical  case,  with 

2=r

  and  a0=0.8. 

Furthermore, we assume Q=1 nC.

From our results it appears that in the quantum regime the gain length and the laser Rayleigh range  

are appreciably longer than in the classical regime,  so that in the quantum regime a longer duration 

time and a larger energy of the laser are required. The current in both cases is of the order of 1kA,

however the requirement on the current density in the classical case is an order of magnitude larger 

since an electron beam radius of 1.6 micron is very small. We note also a more stringent condition 

for the inhomogeneous emittance and the laser fluctuations in the classical case. Therefore, on the 

basis  of  this  example,  we  would  conclude  that  it  is  easier  to  operate  in  the  quantum  regime.  We 

stress that in the quantum regime the emitted radiation has the important property of high temporal 
coherence  with  no  spiking,  whereas  for  the  classical  regime,  with  r =2,  one  would  have  nearly 

3000 random spikes. This is the fundamental difference between the two regimes. A 3D quantum 

model for a FEL with a laser wiggler will be discussed elsewhere.

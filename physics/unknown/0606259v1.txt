Abstract 

Plasma  density  fluctuations  in  the  edge  plasma  of  the  RFX-mod  device  are  measured 

through  the  Gas  Puffing  Imaging  Diagnostics.  Statistical  features  of  the  signal  are 

quantified  in  terms  of  the  Probability  Distribution  Function  (PDF),  and  computed  for 

several  kinds  of  discharges.  The  PDFs  from  discharges  without  particular  control 

methods are found to be adequately described by a Gamma function, consistently with 

the recent results by Graves et al [J.P. Graves, et al, Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 47, 

L1 (2005)]. On the other hand, pulses with external methods for plasma control feature 

modified  PDFs.  A  first  empirical  analysis  suggests  that  they  may  be  interpolated 

through a linear combination of simple functions. An inspection of the literature shows 

that this kind of PDFs is common to other devices as well, and has been suggested to be 

due to the simultaneous presence of different mechanisms driving respectively coherent 

bursts and gaussian background turbulence. An attempt is made to relate differences in 

the PDFs to plasma conditions such as the local shift of the plasma column. A simple 

phenomenological model to interpret the nature of the PDF and assign a meaning to its 

parameters is also developed.

1. Introduction 

The physics of plasma transport in the edge region of fusion devices is of considerable 

interest  for  its  implications  in  plasma-wall  interactions  and,  ultimately,  confinement 

performances of the devices themselves. One relevant fact that has attracted attention of 

researchers  for  several  years  is  the  observation  that  particle  edge  transport  is 

intermittent, in the form of much-larger-than-average events occurring sporadically but 

more  often  than  predicted  from  a  Gaussian  statistical  distribution.  Since  these  bursts, 

although rare, do contribute for a relevant fraction of the total flux, an understanding of 

the  physics  lying  behind  the  generation  and  dynamics  of  the  intermittent  events  is 

deemed  necessary. Nowadays, it is commonly recognized that bursts are  associated to 

coherent  plasma  structures  moving  within  the  plasma.  A  remarkable  feature  is  that 

many  statistical  properties  of  these  objects  appear  to  be  universal,  i.e.,  common  to  all 

plasma  devices,  regardless  of  their  magnetic  (Tokamaks,  Stellarators,  Reversed  Field 

Pinches) or geometrical configuration (toroidal or linear devices) [1,2]: an evidence of a 

common physical mechanism driving this turbulence.  

The experimental and theoretical investigation is rapidly progressing in the study of the 

properties  of  the  individual  coherent  structures  (see,  e.g.,  [3]).  However,  statistical 

analysis  of  the  signal  is  essential  in  order  to  gain  information  about  the  underlying 

physics. We carried out such a task earlier using data from the RFX experiment [4]: in a 

first paper [5], we performed an analysis of the Probability Distribution Function (PDF) 

for  saturation  current  (Isat),  P(Isat),  measured  by  Langmuir  probes  at  the  plasma  edge. 

But for a rather weak temperature dependence, Isat is proportional to the quantity of ions 

collected by the probe, hence to plasma density. The presence of coherent contributions 

in the signal translates into PDFs that differ from the canonical Gaussian distribution. 

An  empirical  fit  of  data,  supported  to  some  extent  by  theoretical  considerations, 

suggested  a  lognormal  form  for  P(Isat).  Lognormal  distributions  are  naturally 

encountered  in  multiplicative  (fragmentation)  processes.  Graves  et  al  [6]  performed 

recently a radial scan in the Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) of TCV tokamak, finding only a 

marginal accordance with the lognormal PDF, while most of their data were compatible 

with  other  analytical  forms  for  P:  they  were  interpreted  within  a  many-levels  birth-

death-immigration  problem,  already  studied  in  [7,8]  and  solved  in  terms  of  a  Gamma 

function,  featuring  an  exponential  tail.  To  further  support  the  idea  that  fragmentation 

mechanisms must be relevant to this study, it should be mentioned that recent numerical 

simulations  describe  the  coherent  structures  as  originating  from  the  stretching  and 

 

2

tearing  of  streamers  from  the  plasma  close  to  the  separatrix  (see,  e.g.  [9-12]).  In  a 

second paper [13], we attempted to provide an account of experimental data through a 

phenomenological fragmentation model. The model used therein describes P(Isat) as the 

result of a fragmentation process of structures over a finite number of sizes, between a 

maximum and a minimum scale. The model was found to work well, providing a rather 

close agreement with the used data set, better than that used in [5]. It provided therefore 

further  evidence  in  favour  of  the  idea  that  fragmentation  processes  are  decisive  for 

understanding edge turbulence. It predicted a tail of the PDF at large values that, again, 

is  approximately  exponential,  not  lognormal.  Independently  from  any  theoretical 

consideration but simply as a result of visual inspection of the data, an exponential tail 

for P(Isat) had already been suggested by other authors, see, e.g., [14] (and also [2], for 

the possible connections with the Bramwell-Holdsworth-Pinton distribution, frequently 

encountered  with  highly  correlated  finite-size  systems).  Unambiguously  fixing  the 

shape of the  PDF may provide some insight about the still partially unknown physics 

driving the fluctuations’ dynamics.       

In this work we present new data produced by the Gas Puff Imaging (GPI) diagnostics 

[15] installed on the recently rebuilt RFX-mod device [16,17]. These data combine the 

improved acquisition frequency of the diagnostics (10 MHz instead of 1 MHz of earlier 

Langmuir  probes)  with  an  average  increased  duration  of  pulses  in  the  new  device,  to 

obtain a still unreached (for RFX) quality in terms of statistical noise of the PDF as well 

as of density range scanned. This should, in principle, allow us to make a PDF analysis 

that is free from the ambiguities related to statistical and background noise. 

Since the starting of its operations in late 2004, RFX-mod has been run under different 

regimes, from the “free” regimes, where no particular control of the plasma column is 

applied, to several “controlled” regimes (CR), aimed essentially at better controlling the 

magnetic configuration at the edge and reducing plasma-wall interactions. These CR’s 

have  by  now  become  the  new  standard  way  of  operating  RFX,  since  they  allow 

outstanding improvements with respect to the older configuration for the same plasma 

parameters  (current  and  density):  roughly,  a  50%  increase  of  temperature  and  energy 

confinement  time,  and  up  to  a  threefold  increase  of  pulse  duration  [18].    They  often 

feature improved transport properties at the edge, therefore, there is  the possibility to 

study  the  statistical  properties  of  the  density  fluctuations,  trying  to  relate  them  to 

measurable differences in the transport in the plasma.

The  outline  of  the  work  is  as  follows:  in  the  next  section  a  brief  introduction  to  GPI 

diagnostics  installed  in  RFX-mod  is  given.  Section  3  provides  an  account  of  several 

experimental RFX-mod  operative scenarios. Section 4 presents the statistical study, in 

terms  of  an  analysis  of  the  Probability  Distribution  Function  of  the  GPI  signal,  for  a 

selection of discharges from each of the scenarios listed in the earlier section. The visual 

inspection of a rather large data set of PDFs brought us to guess some common tracts 

encountered  in  most  of  them:  namely,  that  the  experimental  PDF,  rather  than  with  a 

single analytical function, could be better interpolated using a linear combination of two 

(or possibly more) such curves. A simple phenomenological model is then developed in 

Section  5,  to  provide  an  account  of  these  empirical  findings.  Results  of  Section  4  are 

thus  interpreted  in  the  light  of  this  model  in  Section  6.  Finally,  Section  7  contains  a 

summary and some conclusions.     

2. The GPI diagnostics   

A  sketch  of  the  diagnostics  is  given  in  Fig.  (1).  The  system  consists  of  a  gas-puffing 

nozzle  and  32  coplanar  optical  channels  to  measure  the  local  radiation  from  an  area 

normal to the local magnetic field. The optical lines are 5 mm spaced and cover an area 

of  about  70  mm  in  the  toroidal  direction  and  40  mm  in  the  radial  one.  The  effective 

bandwidth of the electronics is 2 MHz and signals are sampled at 10 Msamples/s. In this 

work the signal from one of the chords of the central fan will be used.  
The  gas  is  puffed  into  the  plasma  at  a  rate  between  1018  and  1019  atoms/s.  A  detailed 

modelling of the gas within the plasma and with the walls would be needed in order to 

precisely assess its impact over the local plasma conditions (density and temperature), 

however  previous  experiences  with  gas  puffing  in  RFX  and  Alcactor  C-Mod  suggest 

that this rate of influx is not perturbative to the plasma [19,20].  

In a first phase of operations, the gas puffed was Hydrogen, that is the working gas in 

RFX, and the measured wavelength was the Ha  line at 656 nm. However, this setting up 

caused concerns about the signal-to-noise ratio, since the GPI signal is line-integrated: 

although  most  of  the  emission  comes  from  the  region  where  the  gas  is  puffed  in,  a 

background signal due to gas desorbed from the wall on the opposite face of the torus is 

also present. In proper operating conditions, the brightness of the local cloud in front of 

the GPI is estimated one order of magnitude more intense than the background emission 

due to the influx from the first wall. However, all of RFX discharges are plagued by a 

 

 

4

localized  kink  perturbation,  usually  locked  at  the  wall  [21].  When  any  region  of  the 

intense plasma-wall interaction caused by this perturbation enters the view field, the two 

brightnesses  become  comparable.  In  order  to  reduce  this  spurious  contribution  the 

optics  has  been  focussed  onto  the  puffed  cloud.  This  does  not  eliminate  the  wall 

contribution,  but  averages  its  fluctuations  over  a  large  length  scale,  hence  probably 

cancelling them.  

of gas puffing.  

At a second stage, the problem was removed altogether by puffing Helium rather than 

Hydrogen,  and  measuring  the  HeI  line  at  668  nm,  which  stands  clearly  out  of  the 

Hydrogen spectrum. However, the discharges analyzed in this work include both kinds 

Fig. 1. Layout of GPI diagnostics. The instrument is aligned along the equatorial axis. 

Since, to some extent, this work overlaps with affine studies carried on using data taken 

from  Langmuir  probes,  it  is  useful  to  point  out  some  issues  concerning  the  data 

collected  by  the  two  diagnostics:  I)  GPI  collects  radiation  mostly  from  atoms  puffed 

into  the  edge  plasma  and  excited  by  electron  collisions.  The  collected  signal  is 

proportional to the collision frequency, hence to electron density, but depends also on 

temperature, that governs the electron-atom scattering rate. This dependence is different 

 

 

 

 

5

from  the  T1/2  scaling  that  holds  for  the  saturation  current  signal  of  Langmuir  probes. 

Therefore, in principle, strong temperature fluctuations may lead to severe divergences 

between  the  two  signals.  (This  is  however  not  expected  in  RFX,  where  relative 

temperature fluctuations are smaller than density fluctuations- see [22,23]).  II) It should 

also be pointed out that the active volumes for GPI and Langmuir probes are different, 

since the latter average over the flux tubes that cross them. Hence fluctuations might be 

averaged out somewhat differently.  

A more important issue concerns the stationarity of the signal. The valves do puff gas at 

a slowly varying rate. The collected signal is proportional to the instantaneous quantity 

of gas available for excitation, and it must therefore be corrected for this slow variation 

before any manipulation. We proceeded as follows: the original time series was divided 

into  1  ms  slices.  Within  such  small  time  intervals,  the  variation  in  the  gas  inflow  is 

negligible. The signal in each time slice was divided by its mean value. Provided that 

any  plasma  parameter  also  remained  constant,  the  result  of  the  division  is  just  that  of 

removing  from  the  signal  the  influence  of  the  source.  After  that,  slices  were 

reassembled  into  one  single  time  series  and  analyzed.  An  example  of  the  GPI  signal 

before and after this manipulation is shown in Figs. (2a, 2b).

Fig. 2b. Zoom of the last panel of fig. (2a). Quite often, in experiments (see, e.g., [9,24-27]), the 
timestory of the signal is asymmetrical, showing first steeply rising fronts followed by smoother 
decay. Some examples of this same feature may be found in the figure, between 44 and 44.05 
ms. This result is usually attributed to the asymmetrical shape of objects travelling in front of 
the measuring line of sight. Notice that in our case, due to the alignment of the lines of sight, the 
motion must be understood along the toroidal direction.   
 

In connection with manipulations of the signal, it is worth recalling an aspect perhaps a 

bit overlooked in literature. In this kind of studies, it is the dynamics of the signal, i.e., 

its fluctuations, that carries most of the relevant information, while the average part is 

ordinarily discarded as an irrelevant offset. We first commented in [5] that sometimes 

also  the  average  part  of  the  signal  may  carry  useful  information.  We  have  just  shown 

that, but for small corrections due to the temperature, the signal collected by either GPI 

or  Langmuir probes is actually  a quantity proportional to the plasma density, n. Since 

the density must be a positive definite quantity, discarding the average part, <n>, hides 

the  constraint  that  the  fluctuating  part 

  must  be  bounded  on  its  negative

whole signal. The reader is therefore averted that, even when writing about fluctuations,

‡
Some  words  are  in  order  about  plasma  control  methods  adopted  in  RFX-mod.  The 

Reversed  Field  Pinch  is  a  system  in  which  the  plasma  produces  its  own  equilibrium 

magnetic  field  configuration,  characterized  by  a  toroidal  component  of  the  magnetic 

field reversed at the edge with respect to the centre, through a dynamo mechanism [28]. 

The dynamo needs, to be sustained in a stationary state, some level of non-axisymmetric 

magnetic  perturbations  (although,  ultimately,  their  origin  is  electrostatic  [29]). 

Historically,  the  main  limiting  factor  for  RFP’s  performances  has  been  the  amplitude 

and  the  number  of  these  perturbations.  In  order  to  reduce  the  unwanted  aspects  of 

dynamo  modes,  some  plasma  control  techniques  have  been  designed.  Basically,  all  of 

these techniques involve shaping of the current/field profile through external coils.  

3.1 PPCD/OPCD 

Earlier  methods  are  Pulsed  Poloidal  Current  Drive  (PPCD),  or  its  variants  like 

Oscillating  Poloidal  Current  Drive  (OPCD),  where  poloidal  currents,  applied  to  the 

plasma from the outside, transiently quench the need for dynamo action by the plasma, 

and hence reduce magnetic turbulence [30,31]. The poloidal currents at the edge affect 

the  toroidal  field,  hence  the  reversal  parameter  F  =  Bf (wall)/<  Bf >  is  commonly 

adopted to monitor the driving (see Fig. 3).  

Fig. 3. Reversal parameter F = Bf (wall)/< Bf> for an OPCD discharge. 

 

3.2 Virtual shell 

 

 

8

More  recent 

techniques 

involve 

the  sophisticated  RFX-mod’s  “virtual  shell” 

configuration,  where  external  circuitry  acts  in  feedback  to  cancel  locally  the  radial 

magnetic field measured by a set of coils on the shell [16,17]. (Similar to this technique, 

is the cancellation of dynamo-driven edge currents from the outside in MST [32]).  

3.3 External rotating perturbation 

The coupling between dynamo modes and the shell tends to lock all the modes in phase 

between  them  and  with  respect  to  the  laboratory  frame  of  reference  [21,33].  The 

resulting stationary localized perturbation is extremely deleterious in correspondence to 

those  regions  where  the  local  shift  of  the  magnetic  field  points  outwards,  thereby 

intercepting  the  wall.  A  way  of  mitigating  the  problem  is  to  apply  an  m=0  (i.e., 
poloidally  symmetrical),  slowly  rotating  toroidally  (f  »

  50  Hz)  external  perturbation 

that, by coupling with plasma modes, would drag them. This does not actually cure the 

problem of the plasma-wall interaction but spreads the outgoing flux over a much larger 

area, reducing the density of heat load. The dragging may not always be successful. In 

those cases, it is only the m=0 perturbation to rotate, modifying the structure of the edge 

turbulence, but to some degree still compatible with the monitoring by the GPI. Figure 

(4) displays the time traces of two relevant quantities during one discharge. The first is 

the contribution to the radial shift of the plasma column at the edge due to the rotating 

(m=0, n=1) mode, in the GPI measurement region. A negative slope means that locally 

the  plasma  is  being  shifted  away  from  the  wall,  and  the  converse  holds  for  a  positive 

slope.  Projecting  the  magnetic  field  line  along  the  bent  plasma  column  yields  a  radial 

component for the magnetic field; hence a non-zero slope may be understood also as an 

effective radial perturbation [34].  A cross-correlation analysis reveals the existence of a 

propagating perturbation in the GPI signal, moving toroidally with velocity vf

  (symbols 

in the plot). Although vf

value is consistent with an E·

 does not necessarily correspond to some sort of fluid flow, its 
· B drift, thus confirming earlier measurements done with 

Langmuir probes [35].  

A complete analysis of the GPI signal in the presence of the external perturbation has 

been presented elsewhere [36,37]. It will be shown here that statistical properties of the 

fluctuations are affected by the phase of the external perturbation.

3.4 Quasi-Single-Helicity states 

As a consequence of some of the earlier control techniques-or even spontaneously-the 

plasma  may  change  its  properties  and  reach  a  configuration  endowed  with  better 

confinement  properties.  The  Single  Helicity  (SH)  State  is  such  a  case.  Such  a 

configuration, where only one dynamo mode survives, is not turbulent, preserves good 

magnetic  surfaces,  and  is  expected  theoretically  to  be  a  possible  RFP  stationary  state, 

although  until  now  has  never  been  observed.  The  closest  experimental  evidence  has 

been so far that of Quasi Single Helicity (QSH) states, where a single mode stands out 

from  the  others,  that  are,  however,  not  negligible  [38,39].  These  states  feature,  too, 

remarkable  improvements,  e.g.,  in  terms  of  temperature  attained  and  fraction  of 

preserved magnetic surfaces.  

 

4. Statistical analysis of GPI data for different RFX-mod operating regimes 

In the figures (5-8) we show PDF’s extracted from GPI data for a sample of RFX-mod 

pulses for each of the operating conditions described above. Macroscopic parameters of 

the discharges were rather similar: maximum plasma current 0.6 MA, and core electron 
density about 3‚ 4· 1019 m-3 . For most pulses, except for those featuring mode rotation, 

 

10

3· 105 points (i.e., 30 ms) from the flattop quasi-stationary phase of the plasma current 

were  binned.  Notice  that  this  figure  is  about  one  order  of  magnitude  or  larger  than  in 

earlier  studies  [5,13].  Pulses  featuring  external  mode  rotation  were  instead  analyzed 

differently:  the  whole  time  series  was  sliced  in  intervals  where  the  toroidal  flow  was 

either positive or negative, and each time region analyzed independently on the basis of 

the consideration that plasma properties might be considerably different. This way, for 

each pulse two or more subsets are obtained, lasting 5 to 10 ms each.  

All  pulses  display  PDFs  whose  tails,  at  large  values  of  the  signal,  are  approximately 

exponential. In some cases there are marginal features that could be attributed to noise 

or saturation of the signal. We attempted to fit the PDFs using Gamma functions, like 

done in [6]. The fit with just one Gamma function seems able to catch the shape of the 

whole  PDF  as  far  as  uncontrolled  pulses  are  concerned  (Fig.  5),  although  some 

exceptions may be found. Improved Confinement pulses are instead less amenable to a 

single-function  fit  (see  Figs.  6-8).  However,  when  we  attempted  an  empirical 

generalization with a linear combination of two Gamma functions, fits turned out to be 

fairly satisfactory:

Table  I.  This  table  summarizes  the  relevant  parameters  for  a  sample  of  the  shots  analyzed, 
including all the shots shown in the figures above: the time range of analysis (tin and tend); the 
effective  degrees  of  freedom  for  the  two  Gamma  components  (N<,  N>);  the  corresponding 
average  value  of  the  two PDFs  (b <, b >,  with  <n>  = 1/b ); the  fraction  of the  total  PDF  that is

An inspection of the literature shows that similar results are not confined to RFX: we 

mention  work  from  Tore  Supra,  whose  data  have  been  interpreted  in  terms  of  a 

Gaussian contribution plus an exponential (or probably Gamma) one (fig. 1 of ref. [40]), 

and  the  PISCES  device,  although  not  a  fusion  device,  where  clear  traces  of  a  similar 

double structure were found in P(n) [41,42]. Perhaps the clearest examples of a double 

structure  come  from  TORPEX  plasmas  [3].  Furthermore,  in  several  devices  there  is 

evidence that the shape  of these PDFs varies, acquiring more and more  of a Gaussian 

character while going from the wall to the plasma (perhaps crossing the source region of 

the coherent structures) [6,27,41,43-45]. Notice that Gaussian curves, strictly speaking, 

can  hardly  be  accomodated  in  this  context  since  their  infinite  support  is  incompatible 
with the constraint n > 0. However, Gamma functions, for N ﬁ

, become practically 

 ¥

indistinguishable from Gaussians. We guess therefore that there is a substantial amount 

of evidence in the literature in favour of the hypothesis that experimental PDFs could be 

fitted  by  the  sum  of  two  contributions.  Empirically,  it  is  here  found  that  these  two 

contributions  may  be  quantified  reasonably  well  using  Gamma  distributions  with 

different  weights  and  parameters.  The  two  functions  should  stand,  intuitively,  for  the 

 

14

contribution  from  two  independent  subsystems.  In  the  next  section  we  attempt  to 

provide a rationale for the emergence of such kind of functions, and also suggest further 

possible refinements to this picture. 

5. An analytical model   

To provide an attempt to a theoretical understanding of earlier results, we postulate that 

the instantaneous measured signal, n(t), be the average of N independent contributions:

(2) 

The meaning of xi’s is that of effective degrees of freedom of the system. One can give 

a visual interpretation in terms of eddies overlapping in correspondence to the volume 

effectively  scanned  by  the  diagnostics,  producing  the  recorded  output.  This  makes  an 

ansatz  like  (2)  rather  plausible.  In  the  model  each  xi  is  thought  of  as  a  stochastic 

variable,  endowed  with  its  statistical  distribution  fi(xi).  We  will  suppose  that  the 
distribution  is  the  same  for  each  variable:  fi  =  f  "

i:  in  other  words  the  xi’s  are 

independent identically distributed stochastic variables. Moreover, the xi’s assume only 

positive  values,  legacy  of  the  fact  that  the  density  cannot  be  a  negative  quantity.  The 

number of contributions, N, is not fixed but left as a fitting parameter of the model, with 

the obvious constraint N > 0.  

Calculations  follow  the  standard  characteristics’  method  for  the  demonstration  of  the 

central Limit Theorem (see, e.g., ref. [46]). We first introduce the Laplace transform of

Hence, the PDF  P(n) is obtained through the inverse Laplace transform of Eq. (3).  

The exact form of  Pˆ  depends upon  f. In the limit of infinitely many variables, we may

That is, regardless of the analytical form of f, the PDF for the sum of infinitely positive 

variables collapses to the Dirac delta. Any finite support for P(n) implies necessarily a 

finite  value  for  N,  and  in  this  case  we  need  a  guess  for  f.  This  may  be  worked  out  in 

several  ways.  An  appealing  interpretation  is  in  terms  of  pure  thermodynamics:  each 

degree of freedom plays the role of a thermodynamical system weakly in contact with a 

reservoir (the background plasma and possibly other degrees of freedom), with which it 

may exchange “energy” (density, in this case). The average value of each x is trivially 

fixed:  it  is  easy  to  recover  from  Eq.  (2)  that  <x>  =  <n>,  and  the  latter  is  a  control 

parameter, in principle imposed from the outside, not related to fluctuations; therefore 

<x>  is  a  given  constraint.  This  corresponds  exactly  to  the  canonical  ensemble 
description, whose equilibrium distribution is the Boltzmann distribution, with b

Indeed, the Maximum Entropy Principle [47] would identify (7) from the outset as the 

most probable distribution of any system, provided that the only information available 

about it is just the average value <x>. It is interesting to notice that one could infer (7) 

also  by  assuming  the  validity  of  the  model  proposed  in  the  earlier  work  [6-8]  and 

exploiting the relationships between the two models. We shall briefly discuss this route 

in the Appendix. Regardless of the path followed to reach (7), once we insert it into (4), 

we get

where G (N) is the already introduced mathematical function Gamma. This concludes the 

derivation.  Intuitively,  from  Eq.  (2),  N  is  an  integer  number.  Since  the  difference 

between  constrained  (N’s  integers)  and  unconstrained  (N’s  reals)  minimization  turned

out not to be wide after a few tests, we preferred to maintain numerical simplicity and 

let the N’s vary over real numbers. Eq. (8) alone is not sufficient to account for all the 

features retrieved from GPI data and displayed in the figures above. Some more general 

expressions must be found. A straightforward generalization is obtained by considering 

a linear combination of two (or more) Gamma functions on the basis of the additive law 

of composition of probability, P(x) = PA(x) + PB(x), provided that the two events A, B, 

be mutually exclusive. That is, there must be separate sources of the kind of fluctuations 

parameterized by Eq. (8), that eventually lead to Eq. (1). 

This  is  the  path  that  led  to  the  fits  shown  in  Figs.  (5-8),  first  guessed  on  a  purely 

empirical basis that eventually turned out to be quite reasonable. However, Eq. (1) can 

still  be  improved:  so  far,  it  has  been  postulated  that  PA,  PB  have  the  same  functional 

dependence: that is, that they are due to two distinct sources but ultimately driven by the 

same mechanism. What if the driving mechanisms are different? An appealing feature 

of  the  Maximum  Entropy  Principle  is  that  it  automatically  generates  distributions  f 

corresponding  to  different  sets  of  constraints:  in  the  equations  above  we  just  used  the 

information that we supposed to have about the  first moment of the distribution, <x>.  

However, it is perfectly legitimate to ask what changes if supplementary information is 
available.  The  next,  obvious  step  is  to  fix  the  second  moment:  s 2  =  <(x-  <x>)2>.This 

looks,  furthermore,  a  more  intuitive  choice  if  one  wishes  to  handle  a  transport  of 

diffusive  origin,  since  the  stochasticity  built  into  this  kind  of  transport  is  naturally 

quantified in terms of the variance around a mean value.  Within the Bayesian approach, 
this  means  that  one  knows  in  advance  the  value  of  s 2,  and  uses  this  information  to 

constrain the shape of the PDF. 

The Maximum Entropy Principle provides in this case a Gaussian shape for f:

6. Discussion of the empirical fittings in terms of the model 

The  results  presented  in  the  previous  sections  are  intriguing  from  a  conceptual  side, 

since  they  hint  to  a  possible  connection  between  the  transport  mechanisms  of  energy 

and matter at the edge and the statistical distributions: a rather common feature  is that 

one  of  the  two  contributions  has  a  small  value  for  N  (N<  :    say,  N<  <  10),  while  the

second  a  large  value  (N>:  N>  >  10).  An  intriguing  hypothesis,  on  the  basis  also  of 

literature  [6,40,41],  is  postulating  the  N>  contribution  as  due  to  the  uncorrelated 

fluctuations  that  drive  turbulent  diffusion,  while  the  N<  one  is  related  to  the  coherent 

part of the fluctuations. Convection-driven flux, being the result of correlated movement 

of  many  particles,  may  be  quite  naturally  related  to  this  latter  contribution.  In  other 

words,  we  might  speculate  that    convective  transport  drives  at  the  edge  fluctuations 

whose  statistical  distribution  is  given  by    Eq.  (8).  Diffusive  transport,  instead  should 

lead  either  to  a  similar  PDF,  but  with  a  much  larger  value  for  the  parameter  N 

(practically  infinite),  or  to  a  PDF  like  that  given  in  Eqns.  (10,12):  from  the  practical 

point of view, it is impossible to discerne between these two latter options: in the low-n 

region, the gaussian contribution to the curve (12) turns out to be order unity, hence the 

two functions (8) and (12) have, to leading order, the same power-law trend in the low-n 

region. Where the two curves do really differ is in the high-n wing: there, no matching 

is possible over large enough intervals, since the former curve is an exponential and the 

latter  a  Gaussian.  In  Figs.  (5-8)  the  high-n  tail  looks,  rather  uncontroversially,  an 

exponential, hence a PDF of the kind (12) may,  at best, account for the low-n region. 

Indeed,  a  few  tests  were  performed,  by  fitting  a  few  of  the  PDFs  from  the  Section  4 

using a linear combination of Eq. (8) and Eq. (12), but no appreciable differences with 

the results already summarized could be found. In the following we discuss the results 

(5-8) in terms of the fit provided by Eq. (1). .  

We  stress  again 

that 

the 

identifications  between 

low-N/high-N  PDFs  with 

coherent/incoherent  structures  and  then  with  convective/diffusive  transport  must  be 

understood  as  speculative,  until  now  not  really  supported  by  definite  proofs. 

Nonetheless,  we  claim  that  the  results  presented  above  provide  rather  strong  evidence 

favouring this hypothesis. We add also two further comments to this regard. 

The  first  evidence  is  that  improved  confinement  regimes  appear  often  related,  at  the 

edge, to a reduction of the content of the low-N fluctuations (see Table I). Conversely, 

the  high-N  contribution,  that  in    free  conditions  has  a  small  weight,  gains  relative 

importance under these  operating conditions. Extensive research on the edge transport 

of  RFX  was  carried  on  in  the  past,    and  showed  that  intermittent  events,  related  to 

coherent structures, may account for up to 50% of edge flux. It is likely, therefore, that 

improvements in the edge transport may be related to reduction of the content  of these 

structures.  

 

19

Indeed, a very recent study strengthens the idea that the N< , N> contributions are related 

to the coherent and incoherent part of the transport: Farge, Schneider and Devyinck [48] 

applied  the  Orthogonal  Wavelet  Method  (OWM)  to  the  analysis  of  ion  saturation 

current  signal  on  Tore  Supra  Tokamak.  These  authors  assert  that  the  OWM  is  able to 

disentangle the raw signal into its coherent and incoherent part. The shape of the latter 

contribution  must  be  guessed  in  advance,  and  in  [48]  the  reasonable  ansatz  of  a 

Gaussian was done, after which the coherent contribution turned out to be quite close to 

a  Gamma  distribution.  The  overall  result  is    fairly  in  accordance  with  our  two-curves 

fits, although the OWM cannot deal fully with the more complicated two-Gamma fits.The next 

issue to discuss is therefore the existence of a wide range of variation of the parameters 

of the two components over the total PDF, as evidenced by Table I.  

The fitting curve (1) involves six free parameters. The normalization of the PDF and the 

constraint <x> = 1 imposed on the signal allow removing two of them:

With four parameters left and with a database amounting to few tens of discharges, any 

attempt  to  identifying  any  clear  relationships  between  the  parameters  and  discharge 

conditions would still be a demanding task. We believe, however, that some trends may 

be identified:  

strongly skewed. 

of the fluctuations.     

1)  In  free  discharges  (Fig.  5)  the  bulk  of  the  PDF  is  quasi-Gaussian,  while  the  tail  is 

2)  In  discharges  with  some  kind  of  mode  control  (OPCD,  Virtual  Shell,  etc  …,  Figs. 

6,7), on the contrary, the quasi-Gaussian component rules the higher-than-average part 

Earlier in the text we mentioned that the literature is unanimous in relating changes of 

the  shape  of  the  PDF  to  the  distance  from  the  wall,  hence  to  mutating  background 

plasma  conditions  [6,27,41,43-45].  Indeed,  this  kind  of  phenomenology  is  consistent 

with a picture in which structures are born from within a radially extended region and 

then move mainly outwards: the more the probe moves into the plasma, the lesser the 

fraction of structures that intercept it.  

In tokamaks, measurements are normally performed in the Scrape-Off-Layer (SOL) or 

just inside the separatrix. RFX has no physical limiter but the deformation of the plasma 
column  creates  an  effective  Scrape-Off  Layer.  The  resulting  SOL  depth,  l SOL,  is  not 

 

20

constant  but  depends  on  the  local  magnetic  deformation.  It  should  be  kept  in  mind, 

furthermore, that, because of the relatively high level of magnetic fluctuations, in RFPs 

magnetic  surfaces  cannot  be  defined  as  precisely  as  in  tokamaks.  Accordingly, 
throughout  this  text  l SOL  must  not  be  understood  as  a  clear-cut  value,  rather  as 

(something  better  than)  an  order-of-magnitude  estimate.  Its  average  value  over  the 
whole surface of the torus, < l SOL>, must increase with the amount of the deformation. 

Qualitatively speaking, we may therefore envisage the following situation: 

1) Free discharges feature on the average a worse control of the plasma column, hence a 
larger  < l SOL>. The GPI diagnostics, which looks at fixed position close to the wall, in 

these cases is monitoring a region of “far SOL”. 
2) In controlled discharges < l SOL> is, on average, smaller, hence the plasma conditions 

probed by the GPI are closer to those of near SOL. 

 

 

Fig.  10.  It  is  shown  the  fraction  of  the  PDF  due  to  the  low-N  Gamma  contribution  (for 
reference, look at Table I) for a few discharges versus the shift of the plasma column at the GPI 
location. 
 

 

 

21

In order to make visual these statements, we plot in Fig. 10 the fraction of the PDF due 

to  the  low-N  Gamma  function  (“the  coherent  contribution”)  versus  the  local 
displacement of the plasma column at the GPI  measurement position, D

. For practical 

purposes, we measure D

 as the algebraic sum of the shifts due to m=0 and m=1 modes, 

as obtained from edge magnetic field probes. We may roughly assume that 

l

SOL

 

for  negative  D ’s.  The  meaning  of  a  positive  D

  is  that  of  a  local  displacement  of  the 

plasma beyond the wall, due to the tail of the locked perturbation. In this situation, the 
concept of SOL loses its meaning. Starting from large negative values for D

 and going 

toward zero is equivalent to sampling SOL regions closer and closer to the separatrix, 

and  we  find  accordingly  a  larger  and  larger  quasi-gaussian  contribution  (i.e.,  reduced 

coherent fraction). There is also a turning point, around 0 mm, beyond which the quasi-

gaussian contribution inverts its trend. Actually, the GPI is no longer probing the SOL 

but  is  fully  embedded  into  the  main  plasma,  whose  conditions  and  ruling  physics  are 

severely different.  

It  is  interesting  to  notice  that  discharges  with  Virtual  Shell  active  and  simultaneously 

featuring  QSH  states  display  often  “effective”  quasi-gaussian  PDFs:  both  Gamma 

contributions    have  large  (>  10)  values  for  N  (and  often  the  two  values  N<  ,  N>  are 

numerically  close  to  each  other).  This  seems  suggesting  that  assigning  the  N< 

contribution  to  some  “coherent”  mechanism  does  not  appear  adequate  in  this  case. 

Hence, we have not included those pulses in the figure, but for a “marginal” case (pulse 

16464  that,  actually,  lies  at  the  very  bottom  in  fig.  10).  The  result  appears  rather 

reasonable  by  considering  that  these  discharges  should  implement  the  best  controlled 

magnetic configurations.        

The  case  featuring  the  rotating  perturbation  in  principle  may  provide  further 

information,  since  the  plasma  column  oscillates  to  and  fro  within  one  and  the  same 

discharge  between  a  minimum  and  a  maximum  displacement.  The  results  may  be 
extracted from Table I. The relationship between the shift D

 and the relative percentage 

of coherent/incoherent contributions becomes, of course, meaningless now. The place of 
the parameter D

 seems now taken by its time derivative: dD

/dt or, equivalently by the 

sign of the radial component of the magnetic field, which is proportional to the former 
quantity, br (cid:181)

/dt. When br is pointing towards the wall (br >0) the coherent fraction 

 dD

becomes dominant, and, conversely, when br changes sign it is the quasi-gaussian part 

to dominate. Here, too, just like the (VS+QSH) case cited earlier, Table I must be read

properly in order not to misunderstand these statements. Actually, during the (21-32 ms) 

positive br phase both contributions may be classified as quasi-coherent (both have low 

N’s  <  10).  Similarly,  during  the  (34-45  ms)  negative  br  phase,  both  contributions  are 

quasi-gaussian ones (N > 10). The explanation for this behaviour is less clear than in the 

static case, and we do not advance any suggestion.  

7. Concluding remarks 

In this work we have presented an extensive review of some statistical features of edge 

turbulence under several different operating conditions. The results presented here allow 

concluding that, as far as edge turbulence is concerned:  

(I)  the  phenomenology  encountered  in  RFX-mod  is  not  unequivocal,  apparently 

depending  to  a  large  extent  on  the  confinement  regime.  It  shares  however  common 

features with other devices, thereby supporting the idea of the universality of turbulence 

at the edge. 

(II) We have been able to cast most of the phenomenology into a rather simple picture 

based  upon  few  parameters.  An  intuitive  description  for  its  statistical  features  is 

provided  in  terms  of  an  analytical  model.  An  interpretation  of  the  phenomenology  is 

also  attempted  in  terms  of  convective-diffusive  related  transport.  It  appears  consistent 

with evidences from several other experiments [6,27,41,43-45],  and is also supported 

by independent theoretical analyses  [48].  

III) Assessing that  the two-Gamma-functions picture is adherent to reality and not just 

a useful but artificial mathematical parameterization, and even providing a rationale for 

their insurgence  is, of course, just a necessary first step. The next desirable step to do 

would be to relate the purely phenomenological parameters with detailed mechanisms. 

Within the picture provided in this work, this is tantamount to understanding what are  

the mechanisms that regulate the relative weights of the two contributions (this would 

correspond to giving a physical meaning to the values of the parameters C in Eq. 1), the 
average density driven by each contribution (the parameters b ), and the amplitude of the 

fluctuations around these averages (which, lastly, provide values for the N’s). We were 

able  to  partially  pursue  this  task  by  recognizing  the  relevance  of  the  distance  of  the 

confined plasma from the measurement region. This is consistent with common findings 

from literature, where the distance from the separatrix into the SOL was identified as a 

crucial parameter towards the characterization of the PDF.    

 

 

23

It is important to recognize also the limitations inherent to the present approach. Indeed, 

we emphasized since the outset that the inspiring guideline behind this study has been to 

identify  common  tracts  in  turbulence  phenomenology  between  different  machines. 

However, a complete understanding of the problem must deal not only with similarities 

but also with differences that necessarily exist: any two devices (or classes of devices, 

such as tokamaks  and RFPs) are different  (often largely  different) in terms of plasma 

density,  temperature,  magnetic  field,  …  .  An  appropriate  analogy  may  be  drawn 

between the present approach and the derivation of the velocity distribution function for 

an  ideal  gas:  there,  considerations  based  on  fairly  general  principles  (symmetries  and 

conservation laws) lead straightforwardly to writing down the Maxwellian PDF. At that 

stage, any two gases are identical, differing at most for their temperature. But real gases 

are  not  ideal:  any  further  refinement  necessarily  involves  some  knowledge  of  the 

specific  molecule-molecule  interaction,  thereby  destroying  the  generality  of  the 

solution. The approach carried forth in this work, as well as in many of the references 

quoted, is clearly similar to identifying the plasma’s “Maxwellian”. Within this context, 
the parameter N acts as the equivalent of the ”temperature” of the system, while b

 plays 

the role of a rigid velocity of translation. They are moments of the distribution function, 

which  are  fixed  by  boundary  conditions  and  may  provide  only  coarse-grained 

information about the microscopic behaviour.

Appendix 

In this appendix we will show that it is possible to assign an analytical expression for f 

(Eq. 7) using, under a suitable limit, the Jakeman’s model implemented in [6-8] 
We note first of all that, if N = 1, P(n) and f  must stand for the same quantity, P ”

 f (see 

Eq. 4). Hence, evaluating P(n) under this limit, provides the sought expression for f .

We do not give here details of the Jakeman’s model, for which we refer the reader to    

the papers [6-8]. We just notice that, there, the tendency to clustering (i.e., allocating all 
the population into few levels of the system) is there quantified by the parameter a

Although rather straightforward, this derivation is purely academical, since it must rely 

on the validity of  an independent model which is already able to provide by itself the 

full answer (8) . There is also another unpleasant aspect in that one is forced to use the

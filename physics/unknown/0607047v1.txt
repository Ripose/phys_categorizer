SUMMARY 

Expressions  are  obtained  for  the  Wigner  function  moments  of  a  paraxial  light 

beam  represented  by  arbitrary  coherent  superposition  of  Hermite-Gaussian  beams 

with  plane  wave  fronts.  Possibilities  are  discussed  for  application  of  the  obtained 

results to modeling real laser beams and to design of optical systems implementing 

prescribed transformations of a beam transverse structure.

INTENSITY MOMENTS OF A LASER BEAM FORMED BY 

 SUPERPOSITION OF HERMITE-GAUSSIAN MODES

The spatial-angular intensity distribution (SAID) of radiation is one of the most 

important  characteristics  of  a  light  beam.  Its  detailed  description  generally requires 

specifying a great number of parameters, which is practically inconvenient and, quite 

often, 

superfluous.  Therefore,  various  schemes  of  more 

rational  SAID 

characterization  have  been  proposed  among  which  two  approaches  seem  to  be  the 

most suitable and universal: a systematic use of the Wigner function moments [1, 2] 

and  the  beam  representation  as  a  superposition  of  the  standard  Hermite-Gaussian 

(HG) modes [3]. The first approach is distinguished by theoretical self-consistency as 

well  as  by  descriptiveness  and  immediate  measurability  of  relevant  parameters,  the 

second  one  is  useful  in  calculations  and  provides  possibility  to  establish  direct 

relations  between  the  SAID  parameters  and  the  physical  picture  of  the  laser  beam 

generation.  Obviously,  it  would  be  quite  suitable  to  know  the  correspondence 

between  the  beam  characteristics  employed  in  both  approaches,  and  the  present 

report  contributes  to solution of this problem in important special cases. Results of 

the  below  analysis  may  be  used,  in  particular,  for  practical  representation  of  an 

arbitrary paraxial light beam by means of a certain superposition of HG modes. This 

will  enhance  the  possibilities  and  the  area  of  applicability  of  the  "embedded"  laser 

beam  method  [1,2],  enhancing  and  supplementing  the  known  recommendations  for 

beam  modeling  by  an  incoherent  mixture  of  two  Gaussian  beams  or  by  an  off-axis 

Gaussian beam [1]. 

As  usual,  we  consider  a  beam  propagating  along  axis  z,  and  the  local 

instantaneous  optical  field  (e.g.,  electric  field  strength)  is  expressed  through  the 

slowly varying complex amplitude u [3]

where  x,  y  are  Cartesian  coordinates  in  the  beam  cross  section,  k   and  ’  are  the

Our task is to find the moment matrix for the beam described by Eqs. (1) and (2). 

Using formulas from Appendix A of paper [1] as well as recurrent relations for the 

Hermite  polynomials  [5],  after  rather  cumbersome  transformations  we  obtain  the

Results (3) - (6) give a general ground for the solution of our problem. As could 

be expected, there is no one-to-one mapping between the two schemes of the beam 

characterization.  For  every  HG  mode  superposition,  one  can  determine  the  unique 

moment  matrix  but  the  inverse  procedure  –  choice  of  a  HG  superposition  with  a 

given moment matrix – can be realized in multitude of ways (of course, if no explicit 
restrictions  for  coefficients  amn   are  imposed).  One  can  easily  see  that  for  arbitrary 

moment matrix possessing not more than ten independent elements, from Eqs. (3) -

(6) the relations follow which unambiguously determine ten real quantities forming 
Kx ,  Ky ,  Lx ,  Ly ,  M   and  N .  Their  knowledge  allows  to  find,  at  most,  ten 

coefficients  mna ,  and,  therefore,  corresponding  representation  of  expansion  (1)  can 

be  unique  only  if  number  of  the  superposition  members  is  limited  or  they  obey 

certain interrelations. 

Nevertheless,  in  spite  of  the  mentioned  ambiguity  of  modeling  an  arbitrary 

moment  matrix  by  the  superposition  of  the  form  (1),  Eqs.  (3)  -  (6)  allow  us  to 

determine  those  parameters  of  HG  modes  which  are  especially  important  in  this 

procedure.  Now,  with  several  examples,  consider  some  consequences  and  ways  of 

utilization of results (3) - (6). 

1. Let the beam be represented by a "pure" HG mode (2); then in Eqs. (3) - (6) 
only one of coefficients  mna  equals to unity while all the rest reduce to zeroes. The 

moment matrix becomes diagonal:

Relations  (8)  and  (9)  permit  one  to  find  a  HG  beam  with  the  given  moment 

matrix. As is seen from the formulas, this is possible not always but only for beams 
whose moment matrix has integer invariants  < x  and  < y . 

2.  Now  consider  a  beam  with  simple  astigmatism  [3],  in  which  the  transverse 

distribution of the complex amplitude is symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to 

the  coordinate  axes  (this  class  embraces,  for  example,  all  axially  symmetric  beams 

that  occur  in  practice  most  often).  HG  mode  (2)  is  a  special  case  of  this  beam;  its 

symmetry or antisymmetry is indicated by evenness or oddness of the corresponding 

index. Obviously, superposition (1) preserves these properties if all its members have 

the same parity. Consequently, for beams with simple astigmatism  M N%

the  moment  matrix,  as  should  be  expected,  acquires  the  distinctive  for  such  beams 

form with zeros at crossings of rows and columns with different parities. In this case, 
the beam is described by two 292 moment matrices Qx  and Q y  where, for example,

which, for the pure HG mode, lead to equalities (8) and (9). 

3. Yet another interesting situation appears when all coefficients of the series (1) 

are real. This means that phases of all the superposition members are equal, and since 

each  of  them  describes  a  beam  with  plane  wavefront,  the  resulting  beam  also 

possesses a plane front. Really, then all imaginary parts of amounts (4) - (6) equal to

which, according to [1], is a characteristic sign of the beam waist [6] (a section with 

plane wavefront). 

4.  Typical  cases  of  realization  of  the  form  (2)  superpositions  occur  upon  the 

multimode generation in laser resonators with degenerate modes of type (1). Let us 

restrict  ourselves  by  the  situation  when

This  example  is  rather  demonstrative  since  the  difference  in  forms  of  matrices 

Qa  and  Qb  can be directly attributed to the wave front singularity of the first beam. 

However, one can easily make sure that the invariants of matrices (11) and (13) are

hence,  matrix  Qa   can  be  transformed  to  form  (13)  by  some  symplectic 

transformation [1]. As both beams (10) and (12) are formed by combining the same 

HG  modes,  this  means  that  the  beam  with  transverse  distribution  (10)  can  be 

transformed to form (12) with the help of a certain optical system consisting only of 

quadratic  phase  correctors  (parabolic  lenses  and  mirrors,  generally  astigmatic)  and 

transversely homogeneous (free) intervals [8].  

This  conclusion  may  be  important  for  adaptive  optics  where  the  correction  of 

phase aberrations causing wavefront dislocations is usually treated as a complicated 

problem due to impossibility to create a correcting mirror of the required shape [7,9]. 

As  can  be  seen,  in  this  case  at  least,  a  beam  with  the  wavefront  dislocation can be 

transformed  into  a  beam  with  the  same  quality  and  without  phase  singularities, 

which, if necessary, can afterwards be corrected by usual means of adaptive optics. 

In conclusion, we present an example of such a transformation. The algorithm of 

arbitrary moment matrix transformation to the block-diagonal form (Ref. [1], Sec. 4) 

enables  to  calculate  an  optical  system  after  transmission  through  which  the  beam 

(10) accepts form (12). Such a system can only be determined ambiguously, and the 

 

where 

 

 

 

practical  choice  of  a  certain  option  is  ultimately  dictated  by  considerations  of 

convenience. In particular, one can show that

optical  system.  This  matrix  has  zero  elements  at  crossings  of  rows  and  columns  of

.  This  causes  that  in 

plane  yz  the beam experiences stronger focusing than in plane xz, and the HG01 and 

HG10 components of (10) obtains different additional phase shifts4 which compensate 

the initial phase difference between them. Really, when transmitting the system with 

matrices  (14),  mode  HG10  gets  the  multiplier  [3]  A

  is  the  complex  radius  of  the  input  beam  wavefront  curvature).  It  can  be 

easily seen from (14) that the ratio of these factors exactly equals to  i , and thus the 

phase  difference  between  the  HG  components  of  beam  (10)  vanishes  after 

transmitting the optical system. 

Considered  examples,  list  of  which  can  be  continued,  illustrate  peculiarities  of 

the two approaches to the beam characterization and demonstrate the efficacy of their 

combined application. All this will facilitate the utilization of the results obtained in 

specific investigations of laser beams. 

                                                 

4 In the newer literature, this shift is commonly referred to as Gouy phase [13].

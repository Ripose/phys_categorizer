Review of Equation of Motion in the Static Casimir Effect  
 
Mohammad  Mansouryar 
 
Abstract 
 

According to the experimentally observed theory of the  static Casimir effect, two metal, 
uncharged, conductive and flat plates attract each other in vacuum .Herein , equations of 
motion of the plates which are influenced by Casimir potential are derived. Then some guess 
about experimental configurations that would provide possibility of observation of 
consequences of the derived results, are presented. As a result, frontiers of static and dynamic 
Casimir effects are somehow explored.  

Introduction

 
 

The static Casimir effect is assumed to be originated of zero-point quantum vacuum energy 
fluctuations polarized by Dirichlet boundary conditions [1]. The following expression is given 
for the potential between two uncharged metallic conducting flat plates:

which shows the plates attract each other in zero Kelvin. This phenomenon has been 
measured with proper approximation in the laboratory [2,3,4]. In present paper, the equation 
of motion due to the potential 
of it.

 then more particle density of the plates, less plasma wavelength 

and the plates would approach one another more, so that mass of the plates shouldn't be much 
because of more effectiveness of vacuum energy on them. For the metals, that is nearly equals

would occur a falling in energy of electromagnetic vacuum zero-point field which results in a 
negative energy density in that region in respect to rest of the spacetime. As seen by (1),

 so although there are basic differences between the case of 

visionable in the nearest distance of holding the potential (1) due to direct dependence of the 
production rate of photon to frequency and frequency to velocity in the dynamical version of 
the Casimir effect [9], a photon emission in the static case can be expected. Although, that is 
merely a guess and final solution will be specified in the lab by satisfying the as ideal as 
possible conditions. As explanation, see formula (251) of Ref. [9] and consider

vibrating cavities –there is periodic motion and frequency if meaningful- and our under 
discussion case, but according to results presented in the last section of that paper, if the 
velocity of the boundary were of the order of " c ", then a sufficient number of photons could 
be created from vacuum practically for any law of motion. Calculations based on Eq.(3) show 
the magnitude of plates' velocity has a strong dependence to the initial dependence they are 
located  in, so that the less initial distance between them, their velocities would be increased 
when time passes much orders more than the conditions with more (initial) distance. As an 
example of a realistic situation, it can be assumed if the plates traverse the distance 10µm to 
100nm, in (at most) 100ms, the velocity formulas gained of (3) are valid either, by 
accumulation of the process the photon production may be expected, see  Fig. 1.

The Classic and Quantum approaches 
 
As a matter of fact, the condition in Fig. 1 seem somehow ideal and in other possible intervals 
some problems in consideration of velocities caused by Casimir potential for the m oving 
plates would raise. It means the theory results something that are not correct in the view of 
special relativity. This is actually originated of the fact that because of being much sensitive

this phenomenon is quite unacceptable. For stating the above comment quantitatively,

Conclusion 
 
In fact, by realistic assumptions about involved parameters in the  Eq.(9), inserting in Eq.(4), 
 , we can gain relations between manually modifiable variables and precision 
adjusting 
of the approach presented here for dealing with the Casimir effect.

In 1951, G.D. Malyuzhinets1 pointed out that a negative phase velocity c of an 
electromagnetic wave can be accomplished in certain periodic electronic circuits 
composed of capacitances C and inductances L. Here, “negative” refers to the 
backward direction opposite to the forward energy flow. If the resulting 
electromagnetic wavelength λ is larger than the circuit lattice constant a, the circuit 
can be considered as an effective medium with a negative index of refraction n. The 
miniaturization of the C and L components has led to 10 GHz operation frequency 
in 20012 and via intermediate steps3-9 to frequencies around 200 THz10-13 in the years 
2005/2006, albeit with modified circuit designs14-16. In this letter, we fabricate a 
silver-based negative-index metamaterial at 384 THz visible frequency and give 
direct evidence for the negative phase velocity by phase-sensitive “time-of-flight” 
experiments. 
 
 
Photonic metamaterials are tailored artificial optical materials composed of sub-
wavelength metallic building blocks that can be viewed as nano-scale electronic circuits. 
These building blocks or “atoms” are densely packed into an effective material such that 
the operation wavelength λ is ideally much larger than the lattice constant a. For a truly 
effective material, Bragg diffraction must not occur, i.e., at least the condition λ  > 2a 
needs to be fulfilled. Along these lines, material properties become accessible that do not 
exist in natural substances, e.g., magnetism at optical frequencies5,7-9,17, a negative index 
of refraction10-13, cloaking of objects18,19, or frequency doubling mediated by the 
magnetic-field component of the light20. It is clear that increasing the operation frequency 
(equivalent to decreasing the wavelength λ) requires miniaturization of both the “atoms” 
and the lattice constant. While the Maxwell equations are scalable, fundamental limits are

set by the metal plasma frequency. For operation frequencies even remotely approaching 
this limit, the resonance frequency approaches a constant21 and Ohmic losses increase 
dramatically. Thus, it is not clear as to whether one can experimentally achieve today’s 
“holy grail” of metamaterials, i.e., a negative index of refraction in the visible (375-750 
THz frequency). At this point, one could literally “see” a highly nontrivial electronic 
circuit at work with the naked eye (Fig. 1a). While electronics and optics are usually 
considered to be two separate fields, they would merge into one here22. 
  
The physics of the particular sample/circuit design used and miniaturized here has been 
described previously in work at lower frequencies10,12,13,16. In brief, for the polarization 
configuration shown in Fig. 1b, the metamaterial can be viewed as composed of two sets 
of sub-circuits or “atoms”: (i) A coil with inductance L in series with two capacitors with 
net capacitance C as an LC circuit, providing a magnetic resonance at the LC resonance 
frequency14. (ii) Long metallic wires, acting like a diluted metal below the effective 
plasma frequency of the arrangement23. We use silver as constituent material because 
silver is known to introduce significantly lower losses24 than, e.g., gold at visible 
frequencies. More than 50 samples with slightly different design parameters and with 100 
µm times 100 µm footprint each, all on glass substrate coated with a 5-nm thin film of 
indium-tin-oxide (to avoid charging effects in the electron-beam-writing process), have 
been fabricated by us using standard electron-beam lithography, electron-beam 
evaporation of the constituent materials, and a lift-off procedure. Results obtained from 
the best sample of this set are presented in this letter. The electron micrograph of this 
sample shown in Fig. 1d reveals good large-scale homogeneity as well as 68-nm 
minimum lateral feature size at 97-nm thickness of the Ag-MgF2-Ag sandwich. This 
aspect ratio (i.e., height/width) exceeding unity poses significant fabrication challenges. 
Compared with our previous choice of parameters at lower frequencies12,13, especially the 
relative thickness of the metal wires oriented along the electric-field vector (i.e., the ratio 
wy/ay in Fig. 1c) had to be increased. This step increases the effective plasma frequency, 
which needs to be above the operation frequency in order to obtain a negative electric 
permittivity. 
 
Figure 2a exhibits measured normal-incidence intensity transmittance and reflectance 
spectra of this metamaterial sample. The bare glass substrate and a silver mirror, 
respectively, serve as reference. Shown in Fig. 2b is the corresponding theoretical result 
based on numerical three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain calculations using 
the commercial software package CST MicroWave Studio. The geometrical parameters 
have already been indicated in Fig. 1c, optical material parameters taken are: MgF2 
refractive index nMgF2=1.38, glass substrate index nsubstrate=1.5, and the Drude model for 
silver with plasma frequency ωpl=1.37×1016 / s and damping or collision frequency 
ωcol=9×1013 / s. At the frequencies of interest here, the Drude model is an adequate 
description of the actual silver dielectric function24. The quoted damping has been chosen 
to match the experiment in the present work and especially comprises broadening effects 
due to any type of sample imperfection. The chosen damping is three times larger than 
the literature value24. Importantly, the exact same set of parameters will also be used 
below for the theoretical analysis of the interferometric experiments as well as for the 
effective-parameter retrieval.

An unambiguous determination of effective material parameters, especially of the phase 
velocity c=c0/n, additionally requires phase-sensitive experiments. The details of the 
phase-sensitive “time-of-flight” experiment based on a compact and passively stable 
Michelson interferometer have been described previously by us12, albeit in a different 
wavelength regime. In essence, we record two interferograms, one with the metamaterial 
sample on its glass substrate in one of the interferometer arms, and a second 
interferogram with just the glass substrate by laterally moving the metamaterial out of the 
optical path. All mechanical motions are computer controlled and realized by precise and 
calibrated piezoelectric actuators. The corresponding shift on the interferometer time 
delay axis yields the phase delay due to the metamaterial. By tuning the center 
wavelength of the incident Gaussian transform-limited 125-fs pulses, derived from a 
commercial mode-locked Ti:Sa laser (Spectra-Physics Tsunami), and by repeating the 
described procedure for each wavelength, we measure phase-delay spectra. 
Simultaneously and similarly, we infer the shift between the two Gaussian interferogram 
envelopes at each wavelength, which provides us with the group-delay spectra. In essence, 
the group-delay spectrum is the spectral derivative of the phase-delay spectrum. Thus, the 
group-delay spectrum sensitively depends on the damping. Corresponding data (dots) are 
shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b together with numerical calculations (solid curves), in which 
we derive the interferograms from the complex sample electric-field transmittance for the 
femtosecond pulse parameters as in the experiment and then proceed with the analysis as 
in the experiment. Finally, we retrieve25 the effective material parameters from theory 
and depict them in Fig. 3c. These “retrieved” parameters refer to a fictitious 
homogeneous film on the glass substrate with a thickness identical to that of the 
metamaterial (d=97 nm) and complex transmittance and reflectance properties strictly 
identical to those of the metamaterial on the glass substrate. 
 
Obviously, the experimental results agree well with theory, which consistently describes 
transmittance, reflectance, phase-delay, as well as group-delay spectra – all with one set 
of parameters. Thus, the effective material parameters, especially the negative real part of 
n (Fig. 3c), retrieved from the same theory and the same parameters can be considered as 
very trustworthy. A determination on the basis of, e.g., intensity reflectance spectra alone 
would be ambiguous and not at all reliable based on our experience. 
  
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a metamaterial with an effective real part of the 
index of refraction of -0.6 at around 780-nm wavelength. This goes beyond previous 
work in the visible17 which showed a negative magnetic permeability. Phase-sensitive 
“time-of-flight” experiments give direct experimental evidence for the negative phase 
velocity of light, while the Poynting vector points into the forward direction. Studying the 
group velocity in parallel provides a sensitive consistency check of our analysis. As 
obvious from Fig. 3d, the figure of merit, FOM, defined via FOM=-Re(n)/Im(n), is 
FOM=0.5 at best, while best values of FOM=3 have recently been achieved at 1400-nm 
wavelengths13. We believe that reducing and/or compensating the losses (via 
incorporating gain materials26) is the next crucial step for applications based on visible 
negative-index metamaterials.

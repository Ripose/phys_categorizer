Abstract

The recent discovery of light moving backwards in time, when it propagates in a

suitable dispersive medium, obliges us to reexamine the Kramers-Kronig relations. In

their usual form, they are dealing with usual light (moving forward in time), and they are

a consequence of causality. In a similar fashion, we derive the appropriate form of these

relations  for  light moving  backwards  in  time,  starting,  instead  of  causality,  from  a

principle of anti-causality, appropriate to such a light.

1. Introduction

In a former paper [1]  the author explained how we can receive light before its

emission [2, 3], if we accept that this light moves backwards in time following the so-

named principle of anticausality, that is that its radius vector is time-like, but obeying

the condition (in one dimension)  c t - x < 0 & c t + x < 0  (anti-causality), instead of    c t

- x > 0 & c t + x > 0  (causality), obeyed by usual light. Wang, Kuzmich & Dogariu [2]

found a negative group-velocity index of refraction starting from a formula (eq. (1) of

[2]) resulting from the  Kramers-Kronig relations (for a derivation of them see [4, 5])

(and using their experimental values of the parameters entered), which are based on the

assumption  c t - x > 0  ( x > 0 ) (causality). And they concluded thus that causality is not

violated, contrary to the fact that their pulse obviously moved backwards in time. But in

order for the Kramers-Kronig relations to hold (in a modified of course form) it is not

necessary to start from the relation  c t - x > 0  ( x > 0 )  (causality). Thus, it will be

found that it is sufficient to start from the more general relation

0,

which may be called the generalized causality principle.  In fact, as we will show in

what follows, the appropriate starting point for light moving backwards in time is the

relations  c t - x < 0 &  c t + x < 0  (anti-causality), from which we can again take a

modified form of the Kramers-Kronig relations, which remain essentially the same, and

thus explaining the apparently strange effect discovered by the above mentioned authors

last year.

2. Establishment of analyticity of n(ω)

The refractive index n of an optical medium is defined as the fraction of the velocity

=

of propagation of light in vacuum over the phase velocity inside the medium, 
n
 (where k is the wave number and ω is the cyclic frequency), and it is a physical quantity

of basic significance. From the relation 
k
it results for the group velocity by derivation that

The refractive index is considered as a function of the (cyclic) frequency ω, and it will be

proven, in what follows, that, as a consequence of anti-causality, n(ω) is an analytic

function of ω in the lower complex half-plane.

In order to see this, let us consider for simplicity an optically homogeneous medium,

with    refractive  index  n(ω),   in  one  dimension,  inside  of  which  an   "electromagnetic

disturbance" of the form  E ( x , 0 ) = δ( x )  ( x > 0 ) takes place, in time  t = 0 . If we

resolve the disturbance according to Fourier,

where   ωt - k x > 0 , if we accept that the wave moves either forward ( t > 0 ) or

(*) The reason for which we are considering ω with negative imaginary part is for the medium to be

absorbing, as it will be clear from what follows. Even the real part of  ω  must here be understood as

opposite  in  sign as  compared  to the corresponding  ω  for motion forward in  time. This is  the case

because   for  motion   backwards   in   time  the   period   of   the   wave-generating  vibration   must   be   taken

negative.

When  t + x / c > 0 , the limit above equals zero, and therefore  E ( x , t ) = 0 . In the case

that n(ω) was not analytic in the lower  half-plane, we would have  E ( x , t ) „

 0  for  t +

x / c > 0  (since then the closed integral in (5) would not vanish), a fact which would

violate the principle of anti-causality, which we have assumed to hold since we are

dealing with light moving backwards in time. Thus n(ω) is an analytic function of ω in

the lower half-plane.

3. Derivation of the relations

Together with n(ω), the expression  n(ω) + 1  is also analytic in the lower half-plane.

Therefore the following Cauchy relation will be valid

We consider that, the integral is taken along an infinite semi-circle with base the real

axis, except from a small semi-circle, which excludes the singularity at ω´  = ω from the

These relations (15) & (16) constitute the dispersion relations of Kramers-Kronig in the

case of light moving backwards in time.

Like   the   normal   Kramers-Kronig   relations,   equations   (15)   and   (16)   are   of

fundamental importance because, in order to prove them, special dynamical assumptions

are not required. Only locality and  anti-causality  are needed. If we take in mind that

now ω' and ω are of the opposite sign compared to ω' and ω (respectively) of the normal

case, and also that the same happens concerning n, while 

=

n
1 lim (

(versus  
+ =

n
1 lim (

)

)

οf the normal case), we see that the Kramers-Kronig relations essentially do not change.

This is why Wang, Kuzmich & Dogariu [2] found the correct value for n, that is  n < - 1

(<   0)   ,   eventhough   the   anti-causality   principle   rather   than   the   causality   principle

obviously holds (since undoubtedly the light pulse's motion is backwards in time).

5. Application

Ending the paper, we mention by the way that, as we know, Imn(ω') represents the

absorption coefficient of the propagation medium. In the case that the absorption is due

to an ideal resonance of the form
n
Im (
(
with ω0  the resonance frequency and δ the delta function, the relation (15) gives

),                                                                                            (17)

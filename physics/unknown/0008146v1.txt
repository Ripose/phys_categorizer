Abstract 

We have reported previously on the conditioning of the 
high-gradient accelerating cavities in the Fermilab Linac 
[1,  2,  3].  Automated  measurements  of  the  sparking  rate 
have  been  recorded  since  1994  and  are  reported  here.  
The  sparking  rate  has  declined  since  the  beginning,  but 
there  are  indications  that  this  rate  may  have  leveled  off 
now.    The X-rays emitted by the cavities are continuing 
to decrease. 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Fermilab  commissioned  the  seven,  high-gradient  805 
MHz  RF  accelerating  modules  in  1993.    In  order  to 
achieve  the  desired  acceleration,  gradients  of  up  to  8 
MV/m  were  required,  which  led  to  maximum  surface 
gradients  of  nearly 40 MV/m.  These high fields caused 
some concern about RF breakdown leading to beam loss 
and to excessive X-ray exposure.   

After seven years, it seems that the change in the rate 
of these breakdowns has stabilized at a level well below 
the  original  specifications:  a  lost  beam  rate  due  to  RF 
breakdown/sparking of 0.1% or less. 

2. OVERVIEW OF MEASUREMENTS 
Automated measurements of the sparking rate of each 
of the seven 805 MHz RF cavities in the 400 MeV Fer-
milab  Linac  have  been  collected  since  April  1,  1994.  
Also,  we  have  automatically  recorded  the  number  of 
beam pulses lost each day, presumably due to RF break-
down in one or more of the cavities, beginning in January 
1994.   

We have measured the X-ray production rate as a func-
tion  of  the  power  levels  in  one  cavity  on  several  oc-
casions over these years. 

2.1. Sparking Rate 

The sparking rate has been measured continually at the 
15 Hz repetition rate of our RF system.  These data have 
been recorded daily.  We have accumulated 1893 days of 
data (82% of the available days).  We record the number 
of RF pulses for each of the seven 805 MHz cavities and 
the number of times an RF pulse at that cavity was ruined 
by an RF breakdown/spark.  We have experimented with 
various ways of detecting sparks in the cavities, and have 
determined  that  watching  for  abnormal  reverse  power 
from  the  cavity  is  the  most  reliable.    We  tried  for  ap-
proximately  five  years  to  correlate  this  reverse  power 
 
signal with vacuum activity in the cavity, and this worked

pressure was relatively high and stable.  But now, better 
vacuum  conditions,  coupled  with  regular,  small  vacuum 
bursts unrelated to spark activity make the spark-induced 
vacuum activity harder to identify.  The ratio of these two 
methods of counting varies by about a factor of two from 
day to day, with an average ratio of 2 reverse-power-only

count.  The  data  we  present  here  are  for  the  reverse-
power-only method.

The  “Days”  column  represents  the  number  of  days 
counted, based on the total number of RF pulses recorded 
that year.  Note that 1998 had only 196 equivalent days—
this is due to a series of major shutdowns in the Linac that 
year.    The  jumps  in  the  numbers  in  this  Table,  particu-
larly between 1995 and 1996 in Modules 1 and 2, corre-
spond  to  increasing  the  length  of  time  the  RF  is  at  full 
value (the “pulse length”). 

There  is  no  indication  that  sparking  is  correlated 
among the cavities.  So, one would expect that the sum of 
the values in each row would represent the median num-
ber of sparks in the entire Linac per day.  

We currently expect about 86 ± 32 sparks in the Linac 
per  day.  This is the median number of sparks, summed 
over all cavities, ignoring possible correlations.  The error 
bars represent the quadrature sum of the standard devia-
tion on the number of sparks per cavity, per day. This is a 
rate of (6.6 ± 2.5) x10-5 sparks per RF cycle, or about one 
spark every 17 minutes of operation.  This is well below 
the original specification of 1 spark in the Linac for every 
1000 RF cycles. 

2.1.2. Rates Per Cavity 

The sparking rate of a cavity depends on many things, 
and  cold,  startup  effects  often  dominate  getting  a  clean

reading  of  the  rate  per  day.    (The  RF  systems  are  inter-
locked, so coming out of an enclosure access often causes 
small  problems,  which  are  generally  manifested  by high 
reverse  power  that  are  not  necessarily  associated  with 
sparking.)  Module 3 seems to have been the most stable 
over these years, so we present the sparking rate per pulse 
per  day  in  Figure  1  for  Module  3.    The  other  modules 
show  similar  characteristics,  but  because  we  have  done 
more experimentation with the pulse length on them, the 
data are not as clear.  

The most striking feature of this graph is that the spark-
ing rate has steadily declined for the entire measurement 
period, and is only now beginning to show signs of level-
ing off.  (Note that one spark per day would be a sparking 
rate of just below 1x10-6, or “-6” on this graph). 

The  fit  to  these  data  for  Module  3  says  that  in  1700 

days, the sparking rate has decreased by a factor of ten. 

We  have  experimented  with  changing  the  RF  pulse 
length  on  many  of  the  cavities.    We  changed  the  pulse 
length on Module 3 in June of 1999 from 60 to 67 micro-
seconds.  According to our previous paper [2], we would 
expect  the  sparking  rate  to  increase  by  a  factor  propor-
tional to the fourth power in the pulse length.  (67/60)4 = 
1.55, which is consistent with the data presented here. 

Prior  to  the  pulse  length  change,  it  appears  that  the 
sparking rate on Module 3 may have begun to level off at 
a rate of one spark every 105 RF pulses.  The other mod-
ules  have  a  similar  behavior,  although  it  is  difficult  to 
factor  out  the  effect  of  the  lengthening  of  the  RF  pulse.  
We will continue to monitor the sparking rate and report 
again in a few years. 
2.2. Lost Beam 

We  also  began  counting  the  number  of  lost  beam 
pulses  per  day  in  1994.    The  algorithm  for  determining 
this, while not ideal, is reasonable: At the repetition rate 
of the RF systems (15 Hz), we look for a beam pulse by 
watching the current on the beam toroid at the beginning 
of the 805 MHz section (at 116 MeV).  If the beam cur-
rent is above 20 mA, then this cycle is a beam pulse.  If, 
then,  the  beam  current  out  of  the  end  of  the  linac  (400 
MeV) is less than 20 mA, we record this as a lost beam

pulse.    This  records  all  sparks  that  result  in  a  loss  of 
beam, but it also captures the occasional beam pulse dur-
ing routine tuning where the input current is just over 20 
mA  and  the  output  current  is  just  under  that  level.    We 
estimate that on days with ten or more lost beam pulses, 
one  can reasonably expect that one or two are from this 
effect.  

The data for the number of lost beam pulses are shown 
in  Figure  2.    The  line  represents  the  median  number  of 
lost  beam  pulses  per  day  for  the  year,  calculated  on  the 
last day of the year. The number of lost beam pulses per 
day  was  significantly  larger  in  1994  than  it  is  now  (an 
average of 64.4 and a median of 9 with a standard devia-
tion of 398 in 1994 versus 2.1 ± 3.8 (median = 1) now). 
Zero is represented as 0.1 on this log graph.  The median 
number of lost pulses per day in 1998 was zero because 
we were down for a large fraction of that year. 

With  30000  beam  pulses  per  day,  we  would  expect 
1.98 ± 0.74 lost beam pulses per day due to the RF break-
down rate of 6.6 x 10-5.  Since we measure between 1 and 
2  lost  beam  pulses  per  day,  we  can  conclude  that  the 
presence of beam does not have an appreciable effect on 
the sparking rate in our cavities.  In [1], we reported that 
there is a 20% increase in the sparking rate during beam.  
The statistics do not justify this conclusion now. 

2.3. X-Ray Measurements 

We have measured the X-ray levels at each of the four 
sections of Module 5 on several occasions: once when it 
was  first  commissioned,  once  for  the  1996  paper,  and 
once again now. The data are shown in Figure 3. 

The 1992 data were taken with a single detector placed 
approximately  four  feet  transversely  from  the  center  of 
the module, between sections 2 and 3. The rest of the data 
were  taken  with  four  detectors  placed  approximately  1 
foot transversely from the center of each of the four sec-
tions of the module. The 1992 data have been multiplied 
by  four  (assuming  a  quasi-line  source)  to  suggest  the 
proper  relationship  to  the  other  data  that  have  not  been 
transformed. 

We fit the data from each detector to the Fowler-Nord-
heim  equation  for  an  RF  field  that  describes  enhanced 
field emission [4].

In these data we see a reduction of beta of a factor of 
two every four years. On the other hand, the area term has 
increased by many orders of magnitude. One can surmise 
that high beta sites are being removed and thereby elimi-
nating  their  domination  over  lower-beta  but  larger-area 
sites. Notice, however, the behavior of the 1996 and 2000 
data  above  37  -  38  MV/m  where  the  more  recent  data 
shows higher readings than the previous data even though 
the detector geometries were the same. This would imply 
that the emitting area increased over time. 

CONCLUSION 

The sparking rate in the Fermilab 805 MHz, 400 MeV 
Linac has reduced to approximately one cavity spark for 
every 17 minutes of RF operation.  There are indications 
that  it  may  continue  to  decrease  even  further.    The  lost 
beam  rate  is  approximately  equal  to  the  sparking  rate, 
indicating that the presence of our beam has no impact on 
the sparking rate. 

Analyzing the X-ray data with the theory of enhanced 
field  emission  shows  continued  reduction  of  the  en-
hancement factor. However, the X-ray levels at the oper-
ating gradient have remained the same or even increased 
slightly.  This  implies  an  additional  change,  possibly  an 
increase in the emitting area.

  In  the  present  paper  we  investigate  the  transmission  and  reflection  band  behavior  for  a  plane
electromagnetic wave falling obliquely on an ideal layered structure.  The dependence of this behavior on the
problem parameters and wave incident angle is considered. It is shown, that in general case the band width is a
non-monotonous function of the problem parameters. A condition is found, which defines the possibility of the
contact of the transmission bands. This condition has the same form for  s  and  p  waves. It is also shown that
irrespective of the wave polarization, the transmission coefficient equals to the unit at the contact points.

Recently the theory of quasi-particles to describe the materials having artificial translational

symmetry  has  been  energetically  developed.  This  theory  is  very  important  for  the  general  wave

theory and also for many physical applications [1-5]. The important features of these structures due

to  their  microscopic  influence  upon  the  quasi-particles  (electrons,  phonons,  photons,  etc.)  are  that

the particles energy spectrum gets the band nature, and the energy itself becomes a function of the

quasi-momentum.  On the other hand, the periodic system properties serve as the basis to explain a

great deal of physical phenomena. For instance, one could mention the results of Bloch on solution

of the  differential  partial  equations,  which  were  taken  as  a  basis  for  the  electronic  theory  of  solid

crystal state by Brillouen.

At present it is possible to make multilayer and periodic structures, using the achievements

of the modern technology mostly connected with new materials syntheses by methods of molecular

beam epitaxy. The parameters of these structures vary in a rather wide range. Due to this, a tendency

prevails  in  solid  state  electronics  and  optoelectronics,  when  superstructure  are  used  as  working

elements when constructing such devices as filters, modulators, sensors, etc. Such working elements

endow  these  devices  essentially  new  characteristic,  which  are  absent  in  the  devices  whit

refractive index, the layer thickness, the distance between the layers, and the incident angle. In our

opinion, such formulation of the problem is of both physical and practical interest. In particular, it

1

allows  observing  dynamics  of  changes  the  system  transmission  when  one  of  its  parameter  varies.

And  such  formulation  is  also  connected  with  the  necessity  of  prediction  of  structures  with

predetermined spectral characteristics.

The  problem  considered  below  is  well  known,  and  its  solution  is  found  in  many  academic

books  (e.g.  [15]).  So  below  we  limit  our  selves  only  to  the  problem  stating  and  final  results.  The

remaining part of the paper will contains the discussion of the results.

Let  us  consider  a  plane  monochromatic  electromagnetic  wave  obliquely  falling  on  an  ideal

layered structure. The dielectric constant of the considered structure can be represented in the form:

Equations  (16),  (17)  define  the  spectrum  of  antisymmetric  and  symmetrics  mode  of  s   and  p

polarized  waves,  which  propagate  in  a  wave-guide  regime  inside  a  homogeneous  layer  with  a

dielectric constant 

ε  and layer thickness  b .

0

 The 

ε  layer is put into an  ε medium. This result is clear if one takes into account that the

0

condition 

cos

, ≤psβ

1

 defines not only the wave transmission bands,  but also gives the region of

wave frequencies able to exist without a dimping inside the ideal structure infinite in both sides. In

the total reflection regime  the wave energy mainly is concentrated in optically more  dense  layers.

When the width of the layers increases, the field energy, which is concentrated inside the optically

less dense regions decreases. Due to this fact, the field inside the infinite structure represents itself

optically more dense layers.

 Below we bring the results of  numerical calculations,  which  show  band boarders dynamic

dependence  on  the  problem  parameters  .  On  the  fig.1-3  the  calculation  was  carried  out,  assuming

that 

ε   medium    is  optically  less  dense  than  that  of  ε  (

εε <

  and

).  Figure  1  shows  the

transmission  and  reflection  bands  locations,  depending  on    the  layer  dielectric  constant  at  normal

incidence for eight different values of dimensionless parameter 
. As it is seen from the figure,
the increase of  ε shifts both transmission and reflection bands to the lower frequency region. From

db /

the given graphs it also follows that when the distance between the layers becomes larger compared

to their thickness the band widths have more tendency of decreasing. For instance, if 

 twelve

allowed bands are located inside the considered frequency region (

0

<

10

), at 

10=ε
5.0=
d

; and

4=

at 
 the number of the bands is twenty three in the mentioned region. It is to be mentioned that
on all figures some band contact effects can be observed for certain values of  ε, and depending on

the  band  locations  and  value  of 

db /

  for  one  forbidden  band,  the  contacts  of  its  borders  can  take

place  one  or  more  times.  On  figure  2,  the  band  locations  are  represented  depending  on    the

dimensionless  parameter 

bd /

from the figures, the increase of 

  for  eight  different  values  of  layer  dielectric  constant.  As  it  is  seen
(as  in the case of increase of  ε (see figure 1)), leads to the

bd /

shift of the transmission and reflection bands to the lower frequency region. It is  also to be mention,

that  in  all  the  considered  cases  of  figure  2  the  band  contact  effect  is  present  (see  below).  In  the

figure 3 the transmission and reflection band locations are shown for  s  and  p waves, depending on

bd /

 for four different values of the incidence angle  α , for 

7=ε

.  It is to be mentioned that on

figure  3  the  band  contact  effects  are  observed  in  four  cases  only,  in  contrast  with  the  cases

considered on figure 2.

On figures 4 and 5 the optically more dense cases of 

ε  are brought (

0

εε <
0

 and 

=ε
0

6

).

The  locations  of    bands  for  s   and  p   waves  (see  figures  4  and  5,  respectively)    are  plotted,

depending on the layer  dielectric  constant for two values of  
,  and at four  different incidence
angles  α. As it is seen from the graphs, the reflection bands decrease, when the dielectric constant,

db /

beginning  at  its  certain  value,  increases,  and  the  allowed  lines,  composing  to  the  allowed  bands,
ε   all the transmission
correspond to the wave-guide layers modes (see above). When  ε tends to 

bands  merge  to  single  band  in  all  the  considered  cases.  Indeed,  when 

  the  layered  system

0

εε =
0

represents itself  an  infinite  homogeneous medium, in  which  a  wave  of  an  arbitrary  frequency  and

polarization can freely propagate.

Now we present some conclusions, which can be made discussing the material of figures 1-

5. First of all, one can state that transmission band width dependence on the layer dielectric constant

and its thickness, etc., is not a monotonous function. This non-monotony appears at those values of

the  problem  parameters,  at  which  the  forbidden  band  width  vanishes.  In  the  case  of  an  optically

more  dense  layer 

)

  the  increment 

  leads  to  a  shift  of  the  transmission  bands  to  the

εε >
(
0

εε−
0

lower frequency  region,  and decreases the bands  width,  after  all.  .  In  the  case  of  an  optically  less

dense  layer  (

εε <
0

)  the  increment 

εε −

0

  shifts  the  transmission  bands  to  the  higher  frequency

region. When  the  incriminate 

 is  the  highest  the  upper  transmission  bands  are  changed  into

εε −

0

lines, which  correspond to those  wave  frequencies, that  propagate  inside  the  optically  more  dense
layers in wave-guide regime. It is to be noted that then the incident angle  α is larger, than the less

increment 

εε −

0

 is needed to convert the transmission lines into the bands.

Finally, let us consider the contact effect of transmission bands. It is present in practically in

all figures 1-5,  at many points. First of all, let us note that a contact means that the forbidden band

width  is  zero,  i.e.  its  boarders  are  contracted  into  a  point.  From  the  four  equations  brought  above

((8), (9) for  s  wave and (10), (11) for  p  wave) every separate equation can define both the upper

and lower band borders,  depending  on the  problem parameters  values.  It  is  to  be  noted,  that  if  an

equation defines the lower (upper)  forbidden band boarder on the left hand side of a contact point,

then the same equation defines the upper (lower) boarder on the right hand side of the contact point.

The  condition  of  a  forbidden  band  width  being  zero  means,  that  the  equations,  defining

different  band  boarders,  give  the  same  solution  for  certain  parameters  of  the  problem.  It  follows

from equations (8), (9) and (10), (11), that both for  s and  p  waves the mentioned condition has the

same form. This condition is represented by two equations:

bk z

0

=

πn

 and 

πmdk z
=

,                                                       (18)

where  n ,  m   are  integers.  To  require  (18)  means  to  require  the  well  known  Fabry-Perot

interferometer condition in the both layers simultaneously.

In  particular,  it  follows  from  (18),  that  the  band  contact  is  possible  only  if  the  problem

parameters are connected by the following expression:

  ,                                                (19)

From the first equation of (18) it follows, that the contact of bands takes place at frequencies:

ω

.                                                          (20)

Note, that at the given parameters of periodic structure  αcos

 in (20) is to be determined from (19).

It is to be noted, that if both  n  and  m  are even or add simultaneously, then equations (8) and (10)

have the same solution. Otherwise, the equations (9) and (11) have the same solution.

 To understand the physical consequences of allowed bands contact effect let us consider the

transmission  coefficient (4) behavior  at the contact point.  As it  is  well  known,  from  the  theory  of

wave propagation in periodic systems, the system length increase at band boarders leads to the total

reflection. For the considered structure the transmission coefficient at the allowed band boarders has

the form [15]:

.                                                  (21)

Expression  (21)  obviousely  tends  to  zero  when  N   increases,  if  only  at  the  allowed  band

boarder  

, ≠psr

0

. If 

, =psr

0

, the transmission coefficient is equal to the unit for an arbitrary  N . Let

us  remember, the reflection amplitudes vanish for both  s  and  p waves if 

 (

, =psr

0

, see

for  example  [16]).  On  the  other  hand,  according  to  (18),  equation 

  together  with

bk z

0

=

πn

 determines the band contact points. So it is easy to conclude, that the periodic structure

becomes  an  absolutely  transparent  for  the  plane  wave,  independent  of  its  polarization  at  the  band

contact points.  The obtained result does not contradict the well-known Bragg reflection condition

at the band boarders at all. It is necessary to note at once, that the contact point cannot be considered

as a boarder point for any allowed band. At the contact we have one large allowed band, formed out

=
πmdk z
=
πmdk z

from the two allowed bands, for which the contact point is interior.

An  analogous  complete  transparence  is  well  known,  but  for  p   waves  only,  when  the

incident angle is that of Brewster [15]. In this case the reflection amplitude for  p  waves vanishes

0=pr

(

). The fact, that under Brewster`s  condition the allowed bands contact easily, may be shown

from the equations (10), (11), which define  the band boarders for  p  waves. Indeed, equations (10)

and (11) have solutions, which coincide with each other not only at the condition (18), but also at

the following condition

Using Snell's law it is easy to see, that (22) is nothing else, than Brewster law (

 Note, that in the case of Brewster angle, the periodic structure is transparent for  p  wave at

an  arbitrary  frequency.  For  the  case  considered  here,  the  structure  is  transparent  for  an  arbitrary

polarization, but at a definite value of incidence angle the wave must have only a definite frequency.

Conclusion

In the  present  paper  the  problem  of  reflection  and  transmission  of  a  plane  electromagnetic

wave    for  an  one-dimensional  periodic  layered  structure  is  considered.  The  transmission  band

locations dependence on the problem parameters are considered both for  s  and  p  polarized wave.

Using  the  standard  theory,  the  equations,  defining  the  even  and  odd  band  boarders,  are  obtained

separately.  The  graphs  for  the  band  location  dependence  on  various  structural  and  material

parameters  of  layered  structure  are  brought.  It  is  proved  that  at  a  certain  choice  of  the  problem

parameters  the  contact  of  allowed  bands  is  possible.  An  analytical  condition  is  obtained,  which

defines the possibility of such contact. This condition has the same form both for two polarizations.

Numerical  calculation  are  brought,  which  show  that  the  band  width  dependence  on  the  structure

parameters is not a monotonous function. This non-monotony appears at the band contact regions.

The transmission coefficient behavior is considered at the contact points. It is shown that at

these  points  the  periodic  structure  becomes  transparent  for  an  arbitrary  polarized  wave,  at  its

corresponding frequency.

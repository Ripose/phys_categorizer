A  room-temperature  beam  of  krypton  atoms  in  the  metastable  5s[3/2]2 

level is demonstrated via an optical excitation method. A Kr-discharge lamp is 

used to produce VUV photons at 124 nm for the first-step excitation from the 
ground-level 4p6 1S0 to the 5s[3/2]1 level. An 819 nm Ti:Sapphire laser is used 

for  the  second-step  excitation  from  5s[3/2]1  to  5p[3/2]2,  followed  by  a 

spontaneous decay to the 5s[3/2]2 metastable level. A metastable atomic beam 
with an angular flux density of 3 × 1014 s-1sr-1 is achieved at the total gas flow 

rate of 0.01 cm3 STP /s (or 3 × 1017 atoms/s). The dependences of the flux on 

the gas flow rate, laser power, and lamp parameters are investigated.

I. Introduction 

Thermal  beams  of  metastable  noble  gas  atoms  have  a  wide  range  of  applications 
including  atom  lithography,1  atom  holography,2  atom  optics,3  cold  atomic  collision 
studies,4  and  precision  measurements.5  Sources  of  such  beams  have  been  developed 

based  on  electron-impact  excitation  where  energetic  electrons  are  produced  in  various 
ways  such  as  an  electron  beam,6  a  DC  glow  discharge,7  and  a  surface-wave-sustained 
plasma.8    These  sources  produce  intense  metastable  atomic  beams  with  angular  flux 
densities in the range of 1013-1015 s-1sr-1. The gas flow or consumption rate, however, had 

not  been  a  primary  design  concern  in  prior  publications  because  the  aforementioned 
applications use gases that are readily available in large quantities (> 1000 cm3 STP).   

 
Atom Trap Trace Analysis,9 in which laser manipulation of metastable krypton (Kr*) 

atoms  is  used  to  count  atoms  of  rare  isotopes,  has  motivated  the  development  of  an 
efficient  source  of  Kr*  atoms  that  can  accommodate  a  small  amount  of  gas  (<  0.1  cm3 

STP).  Indeed,  ATTA  demands  both  high  beam  flux  and  high  excitation  efficiency.  For 

this application, Chen et al. developed a thermal beam of Kr* atoms at the 5s[3/2]2 level 
extracted from a RF-driven discharge,10 and achieved an angular flux density of 4 × 1014 

s-1sr-1 at the gas flow rate of 7 × 1016 Kr atoms/s. The excitation efficiency, i.e. the ratio 

of  the  metastable  Kr*  atom  flux  over  the  ground-level  Kr  atom  flux  in  the  forward 
direction,  was  approximately  10-3.  This  efficiency  seems  to  have  been  limited  by  the 

inherent ionization process present in the discharge. It was observed that increasing the 

discharge  intensity  above  an  optimum  level  resulted  in  a  lower  Kr*  beam  flux.  More 

recently,  Ding  et  al.  modified  the  source  by  replacing  the  RF-driven  discharge  with  a 
microwave-driven discharge, and achieved comparable results.11 

A drastically different approach is to transfer the atoms from the ground-level to the 

metastable level via a multi-photon excitation process. In 2002, Young et al. developed 

an  optical  excitation  scheme  to  produce  metastable  Kr  atoms  and  demonstrated  its 
application in a gas cell.12 Here we report the demonstration of a thermal Kr* beam based 

on the same optical excitation scheme. With further developments, this type of source can

potentially  produce  a  Kr*  beam  with  both  higher  flux  and  higher  excitation  efficiency 

than a conventional discharge source. 

Figure  1  shows  the  relevant  atomic  energy  levels  of  Kr.  Due  to  selection  rules  on 
both angular momentum and parity, the direct transition between the ground-level 4p6 1S0 

and  5s[3/2]2  is  forbidden,  causing  5s[3/2]2    to  be  metastable  with  a  lifetime  of  40  s. 

Consequently,  once  populated  in  the  5s[3/2]2    level,  the  metastable  Kr*  atoms  can  be 

trapped and cooled with laser light at 811 nm resonant to the cycling transition 5s[3/2]2 - 
5p[3/2]3.    The  path  from  4p6  1S0  to  5s[3/2]2  requires  a  minimum  of  three  allowed 

transitions.  In  the  scheme  shown  by  Young  et  al.,  the  atom  is  first  excited  from  the 
ground-level  4p6  1S0  to  5s[3/2]1  with  a  VUV  photon  at  124  nm  emitted  from  a  Kr-
discharge  lamp;13,14  the  atom  is  then  excited  from  5s[3/2]1 to  5p[3/2]2  with  an  infrared 

photon  from  an  819  nm  laser;  the  atom  then  spontaneously  decays  to  5s[3/2]2  with  a 

branching ratio of 90%, thus completing the transfer. Besides this two-step (VUV + IR) 

excitation scheme, 5p[3/2]2 can also be reached via a two-photon (UV + UV) transition 

induced by a single laser at 215 nm. However, present UV lasers, pulsed or cw, are not 

yet powerful enough for this latter scheme to be competitive. 

 

 

II. Experiment and Discussion 

A schematic of  the  atomic beam apparatus is shown in figure 2. Krypton gas flows 

into the excitation chamber through a capillary-plate collimator that has a diameter of 13 

mm, a thickness of 2 mm, and a closely packed matrix of 0.010 mm diameter holes. The 
chambers  are  differentially  pumped  by  two  turbopumps.  The  typical  pressures  are  10-4 
Torr  in  the  excitation  chamber  and  10-5  Torr  in  the  detection  chamber.  The  first-step 

excitation  is  induced  by  VUV  photons  emitted  from  a  Kr-discharge  lamp  with  a  MgF2 

front window (diameter ~ 10 mm), which is placed within 1 cm from the atomic beam. 

The intensity of the VUV photons is measured using a XUV photodiode detector which is 

fitted with a filter with a ~16% peak transmission at 121.8 nm and a width of 12.75 nm. 
We measure that the lamp typically emits 3 × 1016 VUV photons s-1sr-1 with a 100 Watts 

of microwave power. The second-step excitation is induced by infrared photons (819 nm) 

from a ring Ti:Sapphire laser. The typical laser power is 300 mW and a retro-reflecting 

 

3

mirror doubles the power to 600 mW at the excitation region. The diameter of the laser 

beam  at  the  excitation  region  is  approximately  15  mm,  comparable  to  the  sizes  of  the 

atomic beam collimator and the lamp window. 

The  Kr*  beam  flux  is  measured  in  the  detection  chamber  by  laser  induced 

fluorescence  using  a  diode  laser  whose  wavelength  is  tuned  to  the  resonance  of  the 

cycling  transition  5s[3/2]2  –  5p[5/2]3  at  811.5  nm.  Two  laser  beams  cross  the  atomic 

beam  at  the  center  of  the  detection  chamber,  which  is  33  cm  away  from  the  capillary 

plate (Fig. 2).  The resonance fluorescence of the atoms is monitored through a lock-in 

amplifier using a Si photodiode fitted with a bandpass filter. The filter has a bandpass of 

10  nm  and  provide  a  ~50%  peak  transmission  at  810  nm.  Figure  3  shows  a  typical 

fluorescence signal as the probe 811 nm laser is scanned across the resonances. One laser 

beam,  crosses  perpendicular  to  the  atomic  beam,  provides  the  Doppler-reduced 

fluorescence  signal  that  appears  as  a  narrow  peak.  From  the  intensity  and  the  known 

transition rates, we calculate the total atomic beam flux. The other laser beam, crosses at 

a 45º angle to the atomic beam, produces a Doppler-shifted and broadened fluorescence 

signal. From this we calculate that the most probable velocity in the Kr* beam is 280 m/s 

and that the Kr* beam is at room temperature. 

Figure  4  shows  the  Kr*  beam  flux  dependence  on  the  gas  flow  rate,  which  is 

proportional  to  the  pressure  in  the  excitation  chamber.  At  low  pressure,  the  Kr*  beam 

flux  increases  with  the  gas  flow  rate  and  chamber  pressure.  The  flux  saturates  at  a 
chamber pressure of 1 × 10-4 Torr. At this pressure the mean free path of the Kr* atoms 

becomes  comparable  to  the  traveling  distance  of  approximately  15  cm;  and  the  loss  of 
Kr* atoms due to collisions with background atoms starts to take effect.  Above 4 × 10-4 

Torr,  the  collisional  loss  becomes  dominant  and  the  Kr*  beam  flux  drops  dramatically 

with increasing pressure. 

Figure  5  shows  the  dependence  of  the  Kr*  beam  flux  on  the  power  of  the  819  nm 

laser  beam  for  the  second-step  excitation.  The  laser  beam  has  a  diameter  of 

approximately 15 mm, and is retro-reflected to double the power in the excitation region.

The  power  cited  here  and  in  the  figure  caption  is  the  total  power  including  the  retro-

reflected beam. The Kr* beam flux increases with the laser beam power. The second-step 
transition is nearly saturated at a power of 700 mW and an intensity of 400 mW/cm2.  

 

        The power and bandwidth of the VUV output of the Kr-discharge lamp is the critical 

element for source performance. Figure 6 shows the dependence of the Kr* beam flux on 

the  Kr  partial  pressure  in  the  lamp.  We  note  that  the  Kr  gas  in  the  lamp  is  completely 

separated from the Kr gas in the atomic beam. In an actual application, the Kr atoms in 

the  atomic  beam  are  extracted  from  precious  geological  samples,  while  regular, 

commercially  available  Kr  gas  is  adequate  to  fill  the  lamp.  The  lamp  was  filled  with 

either pure Kr gas or a mixture of Kr and He (Kr/He = 10%). In the case of pure Kr gas, 

the Kr* beam flux increases with decreasing of the Kr pressure in the lamp (Fig. 6). We 

believe that this dependence is due to the interplay between the photon emission from the 

excited krypton atoms in the lamp and the resonant absorption of photons by the ground-

level  krypton  atoms  also  in  the  lamp.  At  high  lamp  pressure  (>  200  mTorr),  the  self-
absorption  effect15  becomes  dominant,  resulting  in  a  low  Kr*  beam  flux.  Lower  lamp 

pressures are preferred. However, when the lamp pressure is below 50 mTorr, it becomes 

difficult to drive the discharge towards the front window which is 10 cm away from the 

microwave cavity. In this case, the Kr* flux drops dramatically (Fig. 6) since the optical 
depth for the VUV emission is on the order of 10-6 m at this pressure. In the case of Kr-

He gas mixture, the helium gas helps to maintain the discharge, allowing the Kr partial 

pressure to be lowered to 30 mTorr, and thereby achieving a higher Kr* beam flux (Fig. 

6).  We  believe  that  by  moving  the  microwave  cavity  closer  to  the  front  window  the 

discharge  can  be  maintained  near  the  front  window  at  an  even  lower  pressure,  and  the 

Kr* beam flux can be significantly increased. However, this idea has not yet been tested. 

A  measurement  performed  by  J.  Reader  on  a  similar  lamp  run  at  a  mode  without  self-

reversal (no “hole” in the middle of the line profile) showed that the width of this VUV 

emission  line  was  approximately  300  GHz,  much  larger  than  the  Doppler  broadened 
absorption width and isotopic shifts.16 We have performed a separate test on the spectrum 

purity of the lamp. An interference filter with a ~16% peak transmission at 121.8 nm and 

a  width  of  12.75  nm  was  installed  in  front  of  the  lamp  in  order  to  cut  off  visible  and 

 

5

infrared photons that might pump Kr* atoms out of the metastable level. The Kr* beam 

flux  only  decreased  by  a  factor  approximately  equal  to  the  transmission  of  the  filter  at 

124 nm. 

     When all the aforementioned conditions are optimized, we achieved a 84Kr* beam flux 
density of 2 × 1014 s-1 sr-1, which is equivalent to an atomic beam flux density of 3 × 1014 
s-1  sr-1  at  100%  isotopic  abundance.  The  maximum  flux  is  achieved  at  a  total  gas  flow 
rate of 3 × 1017 Kr atoms/s (or 1 × 10-2 cm3 STP/s). The relative uncertainty of the flux 

value  is  50%,  which  derives  mainly  from  the  uncertainty  in  estimating  the  fluorescing 
volume.  Compared  to  a  source  based  on  a  RF-driven  discharge,10  the  Kr*  beam  flux 

density  achieved  here  is  nearly  equal,  however,  the  excitation  efficiency  is  five  times 

lower because of the higher gas flow rate.  

In  a  discharge-based  source,  atoms  of  all  isotopes  are  transferred  to  the  metastable 

level with equal  probability. In the optical excitation scheme, however, the second-step 

excitation by the 819 nm laser is isotopically selective due to isotope shifts. When it is 
tuned to the resonance of 84Kr (isotopic abundance = 57%), the excitation of 86Kr (17%) 

atoms  is  suppressed  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.  On  the  other  hand,  by  tuning  the  laser  to  the 
resonances of 86Kr (17%) and 82Kr (12%), respectively, we have measured the Kr* beam 

flux of these two isotopes, and found the ratios of fluxes to be consistent with the ratios 
of isotopic abundances. A unique case is 83Kr (11%, I = 9/2), which possesses hyperfine 

structure. Among those transitions from 5s[3/2]1 to 5p[3/2]2 at 819 nm, the strongest one 

is F = 11/2 → F’ = 13/2. Assuming the transition is saturated, we calculate that the total 

branching  ratio  for  the  transfer  is  32%  and,  when  combined  with  the  ratio  of  isotopic 
abundances of 11%, the ratio of fluxes 83Kr/84Kr is expected to be 0.06. Interestingly, the 
ratio  of  fluxes  83Kr/84Kr  was  actually  measured  to  be  0.15,  approximately  two  times 

higher  than  expected  and  just  slightly  less  than  the  ratio  of  isotopic  abundances.  The 
additional flux of 83Kr may come from other transitions not included in the calculation, or 
be due to better lamp performance at the 83Kr lines. 

 

 

 

III. Outlook

For ATTA applications, this new type of source offers several important advantages 

over  the  traditional  sources  based  on  gas  discharges.  In  a  discharge-based  Kr*  beam 

source, a small fraction of the Kr atoms are continuously ionized and imbedded into walls, 

meanwhile, some Kr atoms are removed from the surface of the walls. This effect causes 

a slow but continuous exchange of Kr atoms between the sample and the walls, resulting 
in loss of sample and, worse, cross-sample contamination.17 This problem is avoided in 

an  optical  excitation  source.  Moreover,  a  discharge-based  source  requires  a  minimum 

operation pressure of a few mTorr. An optical excitation source can operate at arbitrarily 

low  pressure,  and  is  only  limited  by  the  statistics  of  atom  counting.  Although  the 

excitation  efficiency  achieved  with  this  source  is  five  times  lower  than  that  of  a  RF-

driven discharge source, we see potential improvements, particularly on the lamp design, 

which can be implemented in later versions. We also note that the on-going development 
of VUV lasers at 124 nm is of considerable interest.18, 19

5s[3/2]1 - 5p[3/2]2, is induced by 819 nm photons from a Ti:Sapphire laser. The third step 

of the transfer process is a spontaneous decay from 5p[3/2]2 to 5s[3/2]2.

We  review  criticality  theory  as  a  prelude  to  consideration  of 
criticality  of 
the  Grad-Shafranov  equation.  Novel  criticality 
conditions  of  ODEs  and  PDEs  are  derived,  easily  evaluated.  The 
possibility that transport barriers are associated with characteristics of 
the equilibrium equation is explored. We conjecture that equilibrium 
criticality permits the appearance of new solution branches: the high 
confinement branch has high poloidal flux gradient in a diamagnetic 
region  of  the  plasma.  Similarly,  criticality  may  lead  to  loss  of 
solution,  which  could  be  related  to  MHD  instability  and/or  island 
formation. 

 

1. Introduction 

The  formation  and  disappearance  of  transport  barriers  in  magnetic  fusion 
plasmas is usually considered as a bifurcation in the transport equations. An 
often considered candidate control parameter for the bifurcation is the local 
electric  field  or  its  shear,  which  can  contribute  to  turbulence  reduction  or 
suppression,  as  originally  proposed  by  K.  C.  Shaing  [1],  experimentally 
studied  for  the  first  time  by  R.  J.  Taylor  [2]  and  extensively  studied  by 
various authors afterwards [3]. More recent candidates are the local q profile 
and/or the local magnetic shear, often invoked as controlling parameters for 
internal transport barrier formation [4]. 
In  this  paper,  we  consider  the  underlying  equilibrium  equations,  and  show 
that  equilibrium  criticality  may  identify  suitable  starting  points  for  a 
transport  or  MHD  bifurcation.  At  a  critical  point  of  the  Grad-Shafranov 
equation,  a  new  solution  branch  of  the  equilibrium  can  appear,  allowing  a 
step gradient in the poloidal flux ((cid:209)
), which would translate automatically 
in a steeper gradient of all the flux surface quantities. Equally, a critical point 
may  indicate  a  fragile  solution  of  the  GS  equation,  susceptible  to  local  or 
global  disruption,  or  symmetry  breaking  and  subsequent  growth  of  MHD 
modes or  island formation.

First, we briefly introduce concepts from criticality theory in Sections 2. This 
is followed by a description of the Grad-Shafranov equation, Section 3, and 
conditions  for  loss  and  appearance  of  solution  in  Section  4.  Finally,  we 
describe  in  simple  physical  terms  how  transport  barrier  formation  and 
equilibrium criticality may be related, in Section 5. 

2. Criticality, simple concepts and technical definitions. 

What is criticality? An equation for y, such as  
 

G(y)=0 

(1) 

  is  said  to  be  critical  or  structurally  unstable  if  a  small  perturbation  of  the 
equation (the operator G) leads to an essential change in its solution, such as 
changes in existence and multiplicity of solutions.  
 
The structural stability of polynomial equations is well known [5,6], 
and it is easily understood graphically. For example, let us consider the cubic 
equation,  y3–(l -l c) y = 0, represented in Fig. 1. When l <l c there is only one 
solution. For  l =l c there is a critical solution, where the 3 solution branches 
from the  l >l c region meet. Notice that at the critical equation, the slope of 
G(y) (considered as a function of y) is horizontal. At the critical point, the 
cubic equation has G=0, G’(y)=0, G”(y)=0, G’’’(y)„ 0 (’ indicates derivative 
with respect to y). The cubic is the simplest equation in which new solutions 
appear.  On  the  other  hand,  the  quadratic  equation,  illustrated  in  Fig.  2 
provides  the  simplest  example  of  solution  loss,  with  G=0,  G’(y)=0, 
G”(y)„ 0). For polynomial equations, the order of degeneracy of the critical 
point  is  given  by  G’’,  G’’’,  etc.      Criticality,  bifurcation  and  stability  are 
distinct concepts. Criticality is a qualitative change in the equation properties 
at l =l c, resulting from perturbation of the equation. Bifurcation is a change 
from  one  solution  branch  to  another, only possible when multiple  solutions 
exist, typically controlled by initial or boundary conditions. Bifurcation can 
happen  smoothly  at  the  critical  point,  or  with  a  “jump” between solutions 
that are apart. Criticality studies a perturbed equation while stability studies a 
perturbed solution. 
The  simple  concept  of  criticality  theory,  that  critically  is  associated  with 
“zero  slope  of  G(y)”,  as  illustrated  in  Figs.  1  and  2,,  can  be  generalised  to 
other  types  of  equations,  including  ODEs  and  PDEs.  A  suitably  general 
description  of  the  slope  of  an  operator  is  its  linearization,  given  by  the 
Gateaux differential in a direction h near a trial function y:

  adds  to  the  externally  driven  toroidal 
field, the plasma is said to be paramagnetic (FF´<0 for a system with positive 
 . In the opposite case, the plasma is 
diamagnetic. It is important to point out that the bootstrap current (pressure-
gradient  driven)  is  always  parallel  and  therefore  paramagnetic,  while  a 
pressure gradient also produces a perpendicular current, always diamagnetic. 
Therefore,  for  fixed  total  plasma  current,  the  bootstrap  current  reduces  the 
capability of the plasma to hold a steep (cid:209) p. 
The  temporal  evolution  of  the  plasma  can  be  described  as  a  succession  of 
equilibrium  states,  with  the  plasma  transport  equations  controlling  the 
temporal evolution of p and F as functions of Y
(R,Z) as a function 
of time.

4. Criticality of Grad-Shafranov equation, loss and appearance of 
solutions 

With  the  above  definitions,  the  Grad-Shafranov  equation and  its criticality 
condition are:

)= 0,

)=  0  indicates  criticality  at  the 
solution  Y

(4), we can derive  the following simple sufficient condition for criticality of 
the equation at a solution Y

J and JY
of (R,Z), via its explicit dependence on  Y
). Therefore the 
criticality  conditions  (4,5)  identify  a  point,  set  of  points,  or  flux  surface 
inside  the  plasma  where  the  equation  is  critical,  and  not  necessarily  a 
functional form of p´ and FF'. Higher Y
 derivatives of J at the critical points 
identify the type of criticality. Note that condition (5) is only realisable if J is 
a non-monotonic function of Y
In PDEs, unlike in simple polynomial equations, we must distinguish local 
and global criticality. Local criticality is given by equation (4) being verified 
at  a  point,  or  in  a  simply  connected  set  of  points  in  the  plasma;  it  may  be 
sufficient  for  loss  of  solution,  but  can  not  lead  to  the  appearance  of  new 
solutions,  since  an  axi-symmetric  equilibrium  solution  is  a  global  event. 
Global criticality, present when equation (4) is verified in a closed poloidal 
loop around the magnetic axis (for instance, but not necessarily, in a whole 
flux surface), may allow the appearance of new solutions.

In the case of solution loss due to a perturbation of the equation near a fold 
(local  or  global),  the  plasma  can  no  longer  be  described  as  ideal,  in 
equilibrium, and toroidally symmetric. The appearance of an MHD mode, or 
of magnetic islands, or the loss of confinement, local or global, are possible 
states  the  plasma  may  change  to.  Therefore  equation  (8)  provides  a  very

simple  test  of  MHD:  if  (8)  is  verified  somewhere  with  JY
equation has a fold. If the equilibrium evolution, governed by the transport 
equations, is driven towards the non-solution region, the critical equilibrium 
is likely to be unstable.  
Physically realisable multiple solutions can exist for the plasma equilibrium. 
They  are  selected  by  compatibility  with  auxiliary  constraints:  total  plasma 
current,  currents  in  external  coils,  pressure  on  axis,  etc.  Once  the  plasma  is 
near  a  globally  critical  equilibrium,  if  the  transport  equations  drive  the 
plasma towards the multi-solution region, a small perturbation in the profiles 
of p or F may lead into a particular solution branch. The difference between 
the various Y
(R,Z) equilibria can be understood as a difference in the angle

  supports  (cid:209) p,  and  therefore  corresponds  to

between 
different local diamagnetism and  (cid:209)
. Note that a local change in angle can 
happen  in  a  time  scale  faster  than  the  field  diffusion  time  scales,  which 
characterise changes in the magnitude of B. 
Local criticality at a rational surface may be sufficient for the appearance of 
an intermediate plasma state in a given flux bundle of the surface, transiently 
breaking  symmetry,  and  acting  as  a  bridge  between  two  still  disconnected 
neighbouring axi-symmetric solution branches.

5. Transport barriers? The equilibrium conjecture. 

The  simplest  example  of  global  criticality  of  the  equilibrium  equation 
leading to new  solutions would be given by profiles that somewhere inside

satisfying the criticality condition (5) at the flux surface with  Y =Y
c. In that 
case a perturbation of  p’ near  Y =Y
c can break the degeneracy of the triple 
zero and lead to an equation with two new  Y
(R,Z) solution branches. The 
“high  confinement”  solution  branch  would  have  greater 
  in  the 
diamagnetic region, leading to increased  (cid:209) F and therefore greater  (cid:209) p, with 
lower (cid:209)
, (cid:209) F and (cid:209) p in the paramagnetic region.  The  “low confinement” 
solution would exhibit opposite characteristics. From the critical equilibrium, 
transport  equations  and  physical  constraints  dictate  the  evolution  of  the 
system  towards  one  solution  or  another.  For  typical  Internal  Transport 
Barriers,  the  paramagnetic  region  would  grow  inboard  of  the  diamagnetic

one,  consistent  with  the  observation  of  flatter  profiles  inside  the  steep 
gradient region. 
We  therefore  propose  the  equilibrium  conjecture:  a  transport  barrier  may 
appear in a critical equilibrium where FF’ or p’ have a degenerate zero. After 
the new  solution branches appear, the high confinement branch has, in the 
“barrier region”, steeper gradients of  Y
, and therefore, steeper gradients of 
pressure, density, temperatures and electric potential. Then the mechanism of 
turbulence  stabilisation  due  to  electric  field  shear,  or  Shafranov  shift 
stabilization [7], can be invoked. Note that because the criticality conditions 
are  related  to  the  shape  of  the  current  profile,  magnetic  shear  is  indirectly 
connected to the criticality condition. 

6. Discussion: proof? 

Most  numerical  solvers  for  the  Grad-Shafranov  equation  are  iterative:  they 
oscillate  between  neighbouring  solution  branches,  and  eventually  converge 
to one only, or diverge. It is difficult to study criticality with such tools. We 
are  not  aware  of  analytical  solutions  of  sufficiently  non-linear  equations. 
Time-evolving  codes  usually  consider  very  simplistic  J  profile  functions, 
usually  linear,  and  usually  do  not  evolve  F’,  but  impose  its  functional 
dependence  on  Y
.  Nevertheless,  numerical  studies  of  evolution  of  the 
equilibrium  towards  a  critical  solution  and  beyond  should  be  possible. 
Experimentally,  equilibrium  reconstruction  is  difficult,  although  it  may  be 
possible,  in  carefully  designed  experiments,  to  establish  if  FF’  has  a 
degenerate  zero  just  before  barrier  formation.    For  now,  the  equilibrium 
conjecture has no proof, however tantalising its implications may be.

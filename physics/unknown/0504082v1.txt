Abstract.

The angular momentum of a classical electromagnetic plane wave of

arbitrary extent is predicted to be, on theoretical grounds, exactly zero. However, finite

sections of circularly polarized plane waves are found experimentally to carry angular

momentum and it is known that the contribution to the angular momentum arises from the

edges of the beam. A mathematical model is described that gives a quantitative account of

this effect and resolves the paradox.

1. Introduction

The angular momentum J(t) of the classical electromagnetic field is given in terms of the

electric E(r,t) and magnetic B(r,t) Maxwell fields by [1]

J(t) = 1

d 3r r

[E(r,t) · B(r,t)] 

(1)

(Gaussian units, bold font denotes a three-vector). For a plane wave propagating in the z

direction the electric and magnetic fields lie in the x-y plane. Accordingly, the Poynting

vector S = ExB, the vector cross product of E and B, lies also in the z direction. Because of

this, the component of the angular momentum in the direction of propagation must be zero,

due to the vector cross product of r with ExB in (1). For paraxial waves, which comprise a

beam of limited radius such as that produced by a laser, this is clearly not the case and the

angular momentum properties of these [2-5] have been analyzed in detail.

However, it has been known ever since the experiments of Beth [6] that a circularly

polarized plane wave of light does carry angular momentum. This apparent paradox has

been the subject of discussion for a long time [7-9] and even recently [10-12]. The

resolution of the paradox is that any obstacle that absorbs the beam changes the

electromagnetic field at the edges of the obstacle so as to give the fields in that region

components in the direction of propagation. These give rise to a Poynting vector that is

azimuthal with respect to the direction of propagation and thus to an angular momentum

vector parallel to it. A qualitative discussion of the matter has been given by Simmons and

Guttman [13]. It seems that although a circularly polarized plane wave of arbitrary extent

may not carry angular momentum in an actual form it does carry it in a potential form in

that any constriction of the wave, such as by an aperture, will give rise to an angular

momentum.

The decomposition of the angular momentum of general (i.e. non-paraxial)

electromagnetic waves has been approached by some authors. Ohanian [14] treated the

angular momentum by expressing the magnetic field as the curl of the vector potential and

decomposing the latter, but his method has the disadvantage of not being gauge invariant.

Barnett and Allen [15] assumed an azimuthal phase dependence of one particular form.

Barnett [16] applied the concept of angular momentum flux arising from the conservation

laws of classical field theory to monochromatic waves of specified azimuthal phase

dependence but did not treat the boundary conditions necessary to resolve the plane wave

issue.

This matter is of interest for the teaching and learning of electromagnetism. A plane

wave is the simplest example of an electromagnetic field with non-trivial properties and

widespread practical applications. A student can readily deduce the linear momentum

density of a plane wave from its Poynting vector. However corresponding arguments for

the angular momentum are open to question, as detailed above, and do not appear to be

discussed adequately in current texts on electromagnetism. We provide a straightforward

resolution of the issue by showing that the angular momentum of a given volume of the free

electromagnetic field may be decomposed into three terms: a volume integral of a spin-like

term (the first term of equation 15), the volume integral of a orbital-like term (equation 17)

and a surface integral (the second term of equation 15). If the field is localized in a finite

volume then the volume of integration may be extended to infinity, where the fields vanish,

and the surface integral will be zero. However, for a plane wave, the fields will always be

significant at the surface of the volume considered and the surface integral must be taken

account of. When this is done the paradox is resolved.

It is the purpose of this paper to provide an exact and manifestly gauge invariant

treatment of the angular momentum of general electromagnetic waves with particular

emphasis on the effect of boundaries on the plane wave problem. We do this by extending

our previous decomposition of the angular momentum of the electromagnetic field by

means of the Helmholtz theorem [17-20] to take account of the surface integrals that

inevitably arise when dealing with a wave that is of arbitrary extent such as a plane wave.

In section 2 of this paper the theory is established and in section 3 the results are applied to

plane waves of arbitrary polarization. Section 4 concludes the paper.

2. Theory

It has been shown elsewhere [17] that by expressing the electric field vector as the sum of

its longitudinal and transverse components by means of the Helmholtz theorem

been examined elsewhere [17] and will not discussed here. The first term of (3), which

relates to the properties of free fields and whose divergence is zero (the transverse

component of E), gives a contribution of

where d2x is the directed surface area element of x. The first term Jfs (15) has the nature of a

spin angular momentum because the coordinate vector does not appear explicitly in the

numerator of the integrals. For fields that vanish sufficiently fast at infinity the second term

of (15) can be ignored if the volume of integration is extended to infinity, but for fields that

do not, such as a plane wave of arbitrary extent, it clearly cannot.

The second term of (6), when substituted into (1) cannot, by repeated partial

integrations, be cast into a form that does not depend linearly on the coordinate vector.

Accordingly, it displays the nature of the orbital component Jfo of the angular momentum

of the free field

Equations (15) and (17) or (14) and (16) give the components of the angular momentum of

the free fields. The first term of (15) or (14) is a volume integral in x with spin character.

The second term of (15) or (14) is a surface integral. Equation (17) is a volume integral

with orbital character.

3. Plane waves

We apply the above arguments to plane waves. The electric and magnetic fields of a plane

wave propagating in the z direction that satisfies Maxwell's equations are given by

E(x,t) = B[ ˆ x (

t - k.x -

) - ˆ y cos(

t - k.x)]

B(x,t) = B[ ˆ x cos(

t - k.x) + ˆ y cos( t - k.x -

)]

with

B(x,t)
t

= - B[ ˆ x sin(

t - k.x) + ˆ y sin( t - k.x -

)]

where  k = ˆ z k  and 

 is a constant. For 

 = 0 the magnetic field of the wave is linearly

polarized at an angle of p /4 to the positive x and y axes. For 

 = + p /2 the wave is circularly

polarized in the + z direction, for 

 = - p /2 the wave is circularly polarized in the - z

direction. The time average over one cycle of the Poynting vector ExB is found to be B2,

independent of 

. The time average of the energy density (E2 + B2)/8p

 comes to B2/4p

.

From (4) we calculate the x component of F:

F x(x,t) = ˆ x 

d 3x'

B
4p c

(sin t cosk.x'- cos tsink.x')

Using the relations

| x - x'|

= 4p

k 2 cosk.x

and 

d3x'

sink.x'
| x - x'|

= 4p

k 2 sink.x

we get

F x(x,t) = B

sin( t - kz)

The y component of F is found in a similar manner to give

F(x,t) = B
k

[ ˆ x sin(

t - k.x) + ˆ y sin(

t - k.x -

)]

Since  k = ˆ z k , F is seen to be a function only of z and t. From (19) and (24) the vector cross

product of F and B is

F · B = ˆ z B2 (sin ) / k

Accordingly, we get for the first term in (14) a contribution to the "spin" angular

momentum of

(26)

where V is the volume of integration. The energy of the wave is VB2/4p

 so the ratio of spin

angular momentum density to energy density is (sin )/w

, independent of volume and in

agreement with the experiment of Beth [6].

The orbital angular momentum contribution from (16) gives zero because F has a

gradient only in the z direction and so the vector cross product of this with r has no

component in the z direction.

Finally we examine the surface contribution to the angular momentum. The

component of angular momentum in the z direction coming from the second term in (14),

the surface term, becomes in Cartesian coordinates

consider r = x, j = x, k = y. This gives a surface integral over the y-z planes at x = +L and x

(29)

This is readily seen to be the negative of the contribution given by the first term of (14) so

it cancels it to give a total angular momentum of zero.

6. Discussion

The angular momentum of a "free" electromagnetic field has been decomposed into three

components. The first of them, the first term of (15) or (14), is a volume integral with spin

character. The second, the second term of (15) or (14), is a surface integral. The third term

(17) is a volume integral with orbital character.

When applied to a plane wave of arbitrary polarization we find that the two terms in

(14, 15) are equal and opposite and, when summed, give a total angular momentum of zero.

The contribution of (17) is zero also. This finding is independent of the size of the volume

of integration and so applies to a plane wave of arbitrary extent. This is clearly consistent

with the arguments following equation (1) that assert that a plane wave of arbitrary extent

has no angular momentum, but inconsistent with the experimental result [6] that circularly

polarized planes wave do carry angular momentum. The resolution of this contradiction

becomes apparent when it is realized that such experiments are always performed on beams

that are of finite extent because they are constricted by some aperture that is part of the

experimental apparatus. The intensity profile of such a beam is as shown in Fig. 1(a). In the

central region, the profiles of the intensity and fields approximate those of a plane wave,

but at the edges of the beam they drop rapidly to zero in a complicated manner. If the

Page 10 of 13

A.M. Stewart  

 Angular momentum of the electromagnetic field

boundaries of the volume over which the integration is performed are placed just outside

the beam then the surface integral is zero and the only surviving term is the volume

integral. If we had treated the angular momentum arising from the first term of (6) as it

stands and had not decomposed it according to (7) we would have got a volume integral

whose contribution was dominated by the fields at the edges of the beam. For the case of a

plane wave of limited extent, such fields are difficult to calculate and depend on irrelevant

details of the properties of the aperture. A much easier calculation is made by using (7) to

separate this contribution to the angular momentum into a volume integral and a surface

integral. We find that when the effects of boundaries are taken account of the experimental

and theoretical properties of plane waves can be reconciled.

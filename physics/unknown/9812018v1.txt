Abstract
the
We have implemented a cost-effective design for
readout electronics of both the anode wires and the cathode
pads of large area proportional wire chambers for the HERA-B
muon system based on the ASD-08 integrated circuit. To
control and monitor the large number of readout channels,
we have built a distributed control system based on Philips
Semiconductors’ I2C bus and microcontrollers. To date we
have installed about 10800 channels of muon chambers and
electronics. The average single channel noise occupancy is less
than 10−5, and the detectors have been operated with target
interaction rates as high as 70 MHz.

I. INTRODUCTION

The HERA-B experiment at DESY is designed to observe
and measure CP violation in B decays. Precise CP violation
measurements will either provide an accurate determination
of the values of the CKM matrix or will point to new physics
beyond the Standard Model.
In the HERA-B experiment,
HERA’s 820 GeV circulating proton beam interacts with a
wire target placed in the beam’s halo. The proton-nucleus
interactions copiously produce B events which must be culled
from the large non-B background. This places great importance
on triggering and event selection. For B decays, this means
identiﬁcation of non-prompt J/ψ decays and leptons with high
the muon detector plays a
transverse momentum. Hence,
primary role in particle identiﬁcation and triggering in the
experiment.

The muon system is segmented into 4 large superlayers,
which measure roughly 6 m × 8 m. The 4 superlayers are
interleaved with iron-loaded concrete to screen out hadrons,
and they are located in the region from about 16 m to 20 m
downstream of the target. The system covers angles from
about 10 mrad near the beam pipe up to maximum angles of
160 mrad vertically (in y) and of 220 mrad horizontally (in the
bend plane or x-direction). The entire system consists of about
32000 channels of readout. Figure 1 shows a view of the entire
muon system.

Figure 1:

The HERA-B Muon System. This view shows the

Three kinds of detectors make up the muon system: tube
chambers, pad chambers, and pixel chambers. The tube and
pad chambers are closed-cell proportional wire chambers. The
cell dimensions are 14 × 12 mm2. About 15000 anode wires
and 8000 cathode pads in these chambers cover angles from
about 50 mrad up to the maximum angles in x and y. The ﬁrst
two superlayers consist of tube chambers arranged into 3 stereo
views. The wire angles are ±20o and 0o with respect to the
vertical. Superlayers 3 and 4 consist of pad chambers arranged
only into the 0o view. Each superlayer also has a pixel system
that makes up about 9000 channels in the muon system. The
pixel chambers cover the small angles from 10-50 mrad near
the beam line.

The tube and pad chambers each have two layers of 16
anode wires of pitch 16 mm; one layer is offset by 1/2 cell from
the other layer. The chamber width is 262 mm, and the lengths
vary; a typical length is approximately 3 m. The anode wires
are made of gold-plated tungsten of diameter 45 µm.
Inside
each pad chamber are two copper clad phenolic boards. Sixty

cathode pads (2 columns of 30) of approximate size 130 × 100
mm2 are cut into the copper cladding of each phenolic board.
The boards are mounted inside the pad chamber so that the
pads in the two layers are aligned. Figure 2 shows superlayer

the ﬁrst completed superlayer, before insertion into the
muon absorber. For more information on the construction and
geometry of the muon chambers, see references [1] and [2].

Collider. In the muon tube chambers, for example, at nominal
high voltage of 2.3 kV, a minimum ionizing particle produces
an anode signal with a mean value of about 30 fC within the
7 ns shaping time of the ASD-08. Using a digital storage
oscilloscope, this was determined by direct measurement of
anode pulses from cosmic rays. This matches perfectly with
the fC level thresholds which the ASD-08 allows. Packaged
chips were produced in large quantities for HERA-B in 1997
for $2.34 per channel, not including testing. The wafers were
fabricated by MAXIM Microelectronics (Beaverton, Oregon)
and packaged by Hana Technologies (Hong Kong).

B. Anode Wire Front End Electronics

The front end electronics for reading out the anode wires
are implemented on 32-channel, printed circuit boards (“tube
cards”, for short). The size is roughly 200 × 80 mm2. They
are mounted in close proximity to the anode wire feedthroughs
of the tube and pad chambers. Figure 3 shows one such card
mounted on a tube chamber. Each anode wire is connected
to the card via a short (approx. 6 cm), insulated wire. The
wire is rated for 18 kV (from Reynolds Industries, Los Angeles,
California). It is soldered to the feedthrough at one end and has
a single pin connector at the card end. The wire is kept as short
as possible to minimize electromagnetic pickup to the ampliﬁer
input.

II. FRONT END ELECTRONICS

A. Choice of Front End Device

The HERA-B spectrometer contains several large systems
requiring high gain, front-end ampliﬁers with discriminated
(yes/no) readout. These systems are the large angle drift
chamber tracking system (96000 channels), the muon detector
the high transverse
the detectors for
(32000 channels),
momentum trigger (26000 channels), and the ring imaging
Cherenkov (RICH) detector (28000 channels).
The large
number of channels dictated the need for a cost effective
solution that would be usable in all systems. All the detectors
mentioned above, except for the RICH phototubes, employ
gas avalanche techniques. The high bunch crossing rate at
HERA-B (10 MHz) makes desirable the highest possible
electronic gain in the front end ampliﬁers. This allows these
detectors to operate at the lowest possible avalanche gain.

An attractive solution is the ASD-08 integrated circuit [3]
developed for the straw tube drift chamber tracker for the
Solenoid Detector Collaboration at the Superconducting Super

box are also visible. The copper foil and the top cover to the rf shield

package. The high voltage is provided via an HTC-50-1-1,
miniature coaxial cable. This ﬂexible cable has an outer
diameter of 3.3 mm. An internal discharge shield allows
operation up to 5 kV. The high voltage is blocked from the
ASD-08 by a 220 pF ceramic, wire-lead capacitor rated at 6 kV
(XICON Passive Components, Arlington, Texas). All other
components are of the surface mount type. To protect against
air discharges, the board is spray coated with a clear insulating
varnish, Krylon 7001. A Schottky-barrier diode, type 1N6263,
protects the ASD-08 if a discharge occurs in the chamber
between the anode wire and ground. In this case, the capacitor
discharge current will ﬂow through the diode.

The design of the tube card includes a number of features
to reduce electromagnetic pickup of noise and to increase the
impedance of feedback paths.
Input and output traces of the
ASD-08 are sandwiched between ground and power planes of
the circuit board. Overall, the printed circuit board has 5 layers.
The ASD-08 has differential inputs; one is connected to an
anode wire, and the other is connected to a parallel trace equal in
length. This allows for differential cancellation of noise pickup
along the input trace path. Decoupling capacitors (0.1 µF) are
located near the ASD-08 package at the bias pins. Also, 10 µF
capacitors ﬁlter the bias voltages (-2.5 V and +2.5 V) near the
power input connector.

The ASD output drives long (up to 20 m), twisted-pair
signal cables. The signal cables plug into a module termed
the Front End Driver (FED) by HERA-B. It is a custom
module built commercially for HERA-B by MSC (Stutensee,
Germany). The FED pulls up the differential output lines of the
ASD by terminating them through 62 Ω into +1.6 V. The FED
latches the ASD data and holds it in a 128 event deep buffer
while the pretrigger and the ﬁrst level trigger decide whether
the data is worthy of sending to the second level trigger.

C. Cathode Pad Front End Electronics

The large length of the muon pad chambers (∼ 3 m) and
need to transport the cathode signals over large distances
requires that the front end electronics be separated into two

stages. The ﬁrst stage is a preampliﬁer. It is mounted near the
cathode pads, inside the pad chambers, and on the side of the
phenolic board opposite to the anode wires. Each preampliﬁer
board is roughly 30 × 25 mm2 and provides preampliﬁcation
for 3 cathode pads. Two bus lines cut into the copper cladding
of the phenolic boards supply power (-3.5 V) and ground to the
preampliﬁers.

The schematic for one such preamp channel appears in
Figure 5. The input stage of the preampliﬁer circuit consists
of a KT3109 transistor in common base conﬁguration. This
allows a small input impedance to the preampliﬁer circuit. The
output stage consists of an ECL Line driver (MC10116 by
Motorola). It drives long (∼ 3 m) twist-and-ﬂat cables from
near the cathode pad to the input of the readout electronics
located at the end of the chamber. The overall gain of the
preampliﬁer is approximately 1.2 mV/µA. To reduce the
number of readout channels, a pad from one phenolic board
is OR’d with a pad from the other board. Figure 7 shows the
OR-ing of the two pads.

The cathode pad front end card (“pad card”) is implemented
as a 5-layer printed circuit board of dimensions 238 × 80 mm2.
Figure 6 shows the top and bottom sides of the pad card. The
input portion of the pad card contains a termination and voltage
divider network.
The network terminates the cables and
attenuates the large signal from the preampliﬁer into the range
expected by the ASD. This allows us to use the ASD integrated
circuit in this application. After this network, the inverting and
noninverting outputs from the driving stage of the preampliﬁer
feed into the A and B inputs, respectively, of the ASD-08.

D. Test and Calibration Procedures

We receive untested ASD-08 chips from the manufacturer.
Our ﬁrst task is to test them before mounting them on boards.
For this test, channel thresholds are set to 360 mV, and through
a 1 pF capacitor, each channel receives an input pulse of
approximately 8 fC of charge. The output from the ASD
goes to a custom receiver module via twisted pair cables.
The receiver module provides the pullup voltage to the ASD
output lines, and it converts the ASD signals to NIM levels
for observation on an oscilloscope. Under these conditions, a
channel is “good” if it gives a pulse of 10-20 ns in width with
few noise pulses. About 75% of the chips pass this initial test.

After assembly, each board undergoes a test and calibration
of all 32 channels. We constructed a test stand to automate
the process. The test stand consists of the apparatus shown in
Figure 8. The basic idea of the test is to measure the efﬁciency
of a channel as a function of 2 parameters, injected charge
and threshold voltage. A test program on the PC controls a
pulser (HP8165A) through an HPIB interface. The program
varies the height of a rectangular pulse that the pulser injects
into a passive, RC differentiator network;
this varies the
spike of charge injected into the ASD. Our custom receiver
module converts the ASD output to ECL levels which go to a
CAMAC-based scaler for counting.

Testing is done in two parts to avoid cross-talk between
neighboring channels. For a given pulse height and threshold
voltage, the pulser sends 105 pulses to the 16 odd channels
on the ASD card. The efﬁciency is the number of pulses
counted by the scaler divided by the 105 injected pulses. The
test program scans the efﬁciency at 10 different pulse heights
before changing the threshold. After the odd channels are
tested, the operator manually switches the input pulse to the
even channels so that they can be tested in the same way.
Figure 9 shows the efﬁciency curves for a good channel of a
pad ASD card.

The last step in the testing procedure is to extract the
calibration curve from the efﬁciency data. The ﬁlled circles in
Figure 9 are the data derived from the efﬁciency curves. They
are the values of the threshold voltage for which the channel
is 50% efﬁcient at each value of the injected charge. The test
program ﬁts this data to the form: Vth = a + b tanh(cQ).
Q is the injected charge, and Vth is the threshold voltage at
which the channel is 50% efﬁcient; the dotted line shows the
calibration curve. As a ﬁnal step for each channel, the program
saves the ﬁt parameters a, b, c in an EEPROM located on the
ASD card. This allows for setting the threshold in terms of a

contains an explanation of the calibration curve.

The ﬁnal tests of the ASD cards are done after mounting
them onto the chambers. The ﬁrst test is simply to reduce the
threshold enough so that the channel is on 100% of the time.
The second test is to turn off the channel by increasing the
threshold. This test relies on the highly nonlinear behavior of
the threshold above threshold voltages of about 1.1-1.2 V. The
charge input required for 50% efﬁciency increases dramatically
for voltages above these values. The channel can easily be
switched off by setting the threshold voltage high enough.
Lastly, a working channel must have a noise level less than a
few × 10−4 in the neighborhood of a threshold of 0.8 V (about
4 fC injected charge).

electronics card. To store default threshold values and the
threshold calibration per channel, each front end electronics
card also contains an EEPROM.

The front end cards (ASD cards) and all their control
electronics form a hierarchy from a computer at the highest
level to the front end cards at the lowest level, as evident from
Figure 10. On the test bench, at the highest level is a PC
running under the Windows OS. In the experiment, the highest
level is a VME-based Cetia CPU Module, running under the
Lynx OS. The computer communicates with a given network
of microcontroller cards through a serial port connected to
roughly 50 m of cable. Attached to each microcontroller card
by cables of approximately 1-3 meters in length are up to 4
power distribution cards. Each power distribution card fans
out low voltage power to a maximum of 4 front end cards
and acts as a control gateway to them. Therefore, a single
microcontroller card controls up to 16 front end cards. Because
the muon system is so large, the microcontroller and power
distribution cards are distributed along the support frame, near
the front end electronics.

A. General Design Overview

B. The Microcontroller Card

With so many front end channels in the muon system,
monitoring and controlling them is an important consideration
in properly running the apparatus. Providing one threshold
voltage per card (32 channels) would be easier than segmenting
the threshold voltages further. However, the optimum threshold
voltage varies with the ASD channel. The way to maintain
the most uniform hit detection efﬁciency is to provide one
threshold voltage per ASD channel.
Furthermore, control
of individual thresholds allows for setting patterns of on or
off channels for trigger testing. Therefore, each front end
electronics card contains one 8-channel digital-to-analog
converter (DAC) per ASD-08 chip, for a total of 4 DACs per

The intelligence in the control system is located in 2
places: near the front end cards and near the operator. The
microcontroller card, Figure 11, is mounted on the frames
near the front end electronics and acts as the local intelligence
in the system. The kernel of the microcontroller card is
the CMOS 80C652 8-bit microcontroller chip from Philips
Semiconductors [4].

The microcontrollers can use either internal or external
memory. We have conﬁgured them to run using both external
program memory and external data memory. The external
program memory consists of a 32K × 8-bit CMOS EPROM

From this state it will respond

the form of character message strings which the microcontroller
must ﬁrst parse and then act on. The PC or Cetia can send
a message which asks the microcontroller to write or read a
piece of its data memory. What the microcontroller writes to its

into data and command registers, and if the microcontroller

distribute the low voltage power of ±2.5 V and +5V to the
front end cards; additionally, for the pad chambers, the power
distribution card also distributes -3.5 V to the pad preamps.
The second purpose is to monitor those low voltages. Each
PDC uses op-amps to sense the currents and voltages.

The third and last task of the PDCs is to act as an I2C
gateway. The microcontroller card may send control signals
to any of the 4 front end cards attached to a given PDC. Each
PDC card contains a PCF8574 I2C bus expander chip (by
Philips). In conjunction with a decoder, it multiplexes the I2C
bus through one of 4 analog switches to one of the front end
cards.

IV. SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND OPERATIONAL

CHARACTERISTICS

A. DC Power Supply System

The DC power is provided by high current (100 A), well
regulated, linear supplies (Kepco model ATE 6-100M). The
supplies are located about 6 meters from a given ASD card.
The supplies are mounted on the muon support platforms
inside the concrete shielding of the experimental area. They are
remotely controlled from outside the shield wall by a voltage
level. The supplies are located as closely as possible to the
ASD cards is to minimize ohmic losses and noise pickup.

The power supplies feed a set of bus bars mounted directly
on the support frame for the chambers. To allow ease in
separating the two halves of a given frame, each half has its
own set of copper bus bars, 60 mm2 in cross section by roughly

(CY27C256 by Cypress Semiconductor, San Jose, California).
The external data memory is a 32K × 8-bit CMOS RAM
(CY62256 by Cypress). The program memory is mounted in
a socket on the printed circuit board to allow for removal and
reprogramming.

The microcontroller card has 2 communication interfaces
with the world external to it. To communicate with the PC
or Cetia,
it uses an RS422 (differential) serial line. The
microcontroller has a single-ended, full-duplex UART built
into the chip. Off-chip, a 75ALS180 line driver interfaces the
microcontroller’s serial port to the differential serial line.

The second communication interface to the outside world
is the I2C bus [5]. The microcontroller chip has a built-in I2C
bus interface. This allows it to communicate with the DAC
and EEPROM integrated circuits which also have built-in
I2C interfaces. The microcontroller is the only I2C master
on the bus. To drive cables of several meters between the
microcontroller card and the power distribution cards,
the
microcontroller chip is interfaced to the bus via the bipolar
82B715 I2C bus driver integrated circuit (by Philips). It buffers
both the clock and the data lines of the I2C bus.

Another function of the microcontroller is to monitor the
low voltage power supplied to the front end cards. Via a twist-
and-ﬂat cable plugged into the microcontroller card, each PDC
returns analog monitoring voltages for the current and voltage
levels on the ±2.5 V, +5 V, and -3.5 V power. The 8 monitoring
voltages are multiplexed into a single 8-bit ADC. An end-of-
conversion (EOC) on the ADC is tied to the start signal, so
that the ADC continually samples its inputs. The EOC also

C. Operation and Performance

Presently, a substantial amount of the muon system is
installed. Of the 4 superlayers in the muon system, superlayer
1 is completely in place; superlayers 3 and 4 each have half
a layer in place. The total number of installed channels is
approximately 10800.

Using the existing Front End Drivers and DAQ system, we
have measured the noise performance and detector response at
high interaction rates. Typical noise occupancies for a channel
are in the range of a few ×10−6 for threshold values on the
efﬁciency plateau for our chambers. This measurement is based
on 130000 triggers per channel.

We have also measured the occupancy in the chambers
when there are interactions in the HERA-B target. In Figure 13
is a plot of the average occupancy in a given superlayer (1, 3,
or 4) for a given type of readout (tube/pad) as a function of
the interaction rate (IR) in the target. The average occupancy
scales with the IR and goes toward zero when the IR goes
toward zero. As expected, the rates are highest in the ﬁrst
superlayer since it is downstream of only part of the muon
absorber. The rates are higher in the anode wires than in the
cathode pads because the anode wires detect particles over a
larger area. Occupancies are measured with interaction rates
up to 70 MHz, about 1.8 times the rate at which HERA-B
will run. Thus, initial indications are that the 10800 channels
currently installed are capable of operating well at the 40 MHz
interaction rate required by HERA-B. The remaining 2/3 of the
muon channels will be installed during late 1998 and during
1999.

The Power Distribution Card. The card is mounted in
an aluminum box to shield it from rf pickup. The 4 connectors to
the front end cards are at the top of the ﬁgure. The connector to the
microcontroller is in the lower right, and the 4 connectors for the pad
preamp power are on the left.

power is supplied on a bus bar of 200 mm2 cross section.

B. Oscillation and Noise Control

A fast high gain ampliﬁer capable of detecting signals in
the fC range is readily susceptible to noise and to feedback.
Combating these problems in the case of the tube ASD card
requires three primary measures. First, a copper foil shields the
ends of the anode wires and the ASD inputs. The foil is attached
directly to the ground of the ASD card at one end and to the
chamber via conductive epoxy at the other end. This structure
is paramount to providing a low impedance connection between
the ground of the chamber body and the ground on the ASD
card.

The second preventive measure is an rf shield surrounding
the card and the ends of the anode wires. Figure 3 shows
the rf shield with the top cover removed. The shield is made
of aluminum. Together with the chamber body, the rf shield
provides essentially 4π coverage of the tube readout card and
the anode wires.

The third preventive measure is care in routing the signal
cabling. These cables are ﬂat and unshielded, and they have 17
twisted pairs that lead from the ASD card to the FED modules
(see Section B). To minimize the coupling between the signal
cable and the ASD inputs, the signal cables are prevented
from touching the chambers or the support frame. To prevent
coupling between the cables, insulating spacers of thickness
5 mm are inserted between neighboring pairs of cables along
the 3 m nearest the ASD card.

The nominal interaction rate for HERA-B is 40 MHz. The chambers
and readout operate well at nearly twice the nominal interaction rate.

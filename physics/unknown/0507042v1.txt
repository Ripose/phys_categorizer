Absolute Ar  XK  (3 keV)  and  Xe  XL  (4 keV) photon yields are  measured  as  a  function of  laser 

peak  intensity,  for  large  (104  -  105  atoms)  argon  and  xenon  clusters  submitted  to  intense  laser 

pulses. A clear threshold behavior is observed. The intensity threshold is found as low as 2 1014

Wcm-2,  a  value  matching  the  production  of  singly-charged  argon  or  doubly-charged  xenon  by 

optical field ionization. Possible mechanisms involved in the inner-shell ionization are discussed. 

The outcome on the optimization of keV X-ray production is underlined.

A fascinating feature of intense laser-matter interaction is its efficiency for converting photons in 

the eV range to X-rays in the keV. It is now well known that large clusters, similarly to solids, 

couple  very  efficiently  with  intense  subpicosecond  laser  pulses.  A  highly  ionized  and  excited 

medium is formed at the cluster scale (a few ten nanometers), and treated in some models 1 2 3 as 

a "nanoplasma". Highly charged ions with energies reaching the MeV 4 5, electrons with energies 

up to a few keV 6, and UV 2 and keV X-ray photons from inner-shell ionized atoms are emitted 7

8 9 10.

X-ray spectroscopy allows to perform quantitative measurements, and short lifetime states down 

to  a  few  ten  femtoseconds  are  observed.  This  gives  access  to  the  dynamical  evolution  of  the 

irradiated cluster on a time scale comparable to the laser pulse duration, and much smaller than 

reached in the case of ion spectroscopy. It must be noted, however, that only ions with inner-shell 

vacancies  can  be  observed  by  X-ray  spectroscopy.  Up  to  now,  X-ray  emission  studies  have 

nevertheless been mainly limited to qualitative observations. A systematic study of absolute X-

ray  emission  yields  and  ionic  charge  state  distributions  as  a  function  of  various  physical 

parameters governing the laser-cluster interaction (cluster size, atomic number  and total atomic 

density on one hand, laser pulse energy, pulse duration, wavelength and polarization on the other 

hand) was still lacking. In this Letter, we present the results of such a quantitative study, here for 

X-ray yields as a function of laser peak intensity. New possible mechanisms for the production of 

highly charged ions with inner-shell vacancies are considered. 

2

After a decade of experimental and theoretical studies devoted to these phenomena, most of the 

models  which  have  been  developed  so  far  still  remain  controversial11.  In  all  models  some 

electrons are first released from atoms in the cluster by optical field ionization (OFI). However, 

this process alone cannot explain the production of, for instance, highly ionized argon ions with a 

K  vacancy,  since  a  minimum  intensity  of  4  1021  Wcm-2  would  be  necessary  in  the  barrier 

suppression ionization approximation. Two main mechanisms have been proposed to account for 

the  production  of  highly  charged  ions.  Further  ionization  can  take  place  through  electron-ion 

collisions (inelastic scattering) in the cluster as assumed in the nanoplasma model  2, where fast 

electrons are produced by inverse bremsstrahlung. This process becomes very efficient when the 

plasma  frequency  in  the  cluster  matches  the  laser  frequency.  Megi  et  al.  12  have  performed 

calculations showing, however, that this resonance should be strongly damped, and predict much 

lower  electron  temperatures.  Alternatively,  ionization  may  be  assisted  by  an  increase  of  the 

electric field inside the cluster due to the combined charge of electrons and ions, as introduced by 

Rose-Petruck  et  al.  13  in  the  “Ignition  Ionization  Model”.  None  of  these  models  leads  to  the 

prediction  of  hard  X-ray  emission.  In  this  context,  we  have  proposed  a  simple  Inner-Shell 

Ionization  (ISI)  model  9  where  ionization  is  due  to  the  inelastic  collisions  of  electrons  moving 

freely in the laser field. This model uses the concept of effective focal volume corresponding to 

the  region  of  space  where  the  laser  intensity  is  large  enough  to  induce  an  electron  velocity 

sufficient  to  produce  K-shell  or  L-shell  vacancies.  A  prediction  of  this  model  is  an  intensity 

threshold value of a few 1016 Wcm-2 for Xe L-shell or Ar K-shell ionization. The data presented 

in the following show, in fact, intensity thresholds one or two orders of magnitude smaller.

The experimental setup, including the apparatus used for cluster generation, has been described in 

detail  in  previous  publications  8  9.  Briefly,  clusters  are  generated  within  a  pulsed  adiabatic 

expansion of the well documented Hagena type 14 15. This device leads to a mean atomic density 

proportional  to  the  backing  pressure  (P0),  and  a  mean  cluster  size  scaling  16 17  as 

8.1
0P

.  More 

details will be given in a forthcoming paper devoted to the evolution of X-ray yields with cluster 

size. The intense laser field is generated with a Ti:sapphire laser system delivering pulses of 50 fs 

minimum duration at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 20 Hz. The beam diameter is approximately 

50 mm and the maximum pulse energy available in the interaction zone is 100 mJ. The laser light 

is focused with a f = 480 mm lens leading to a 1/e2 beam waist of ~ 30 μm and maximum peak 

intensities  Ipeak  ~  1017  Wcm-2.  The  Ipeak  values  are  determined  by  imaging  the  focal  point  on  a 

CCD camera and from systematic measurements via autocorrelation techniques of the laser pulse 

duration taking into account the temporal aberrations induced by the lens. Total uncertainties on 

Ipeak values are estimated to be ~ 20%. 

X-rays  are  analyzed  using  two  Si(Li)  detectors  and  a  high-resolution  high-transmission  Bragg-

crystal  spectrometer.  A  description  of  these  spectrometers18  and  of  the  procedure  used  to 

determine  absolute  yields  8 9  has  been  given  elsewhere.  In  the  case  of  Ar  clusters,  the  X-ray 

spectrum observed with a Si(Li) detector, exhibits as a main feature a K(cid:68) transition at 3.1 keV, 

with  a  low  energy  background  due  to  bremsstrahlung.  With  the  crystal  spectrometer,  several 

components  in  the  K(cid:68)  are  resolved  (as  shown  in  Fig.  1),  which  correspond  to  different  charge 

states between 12+ up to 16+ (heliumlike). For such a typical spectrum, recorded in the regime of 

high  laser  intensity,  the  mean  charge  state  is  close  to  14.5.  Absolute  X-ray  yields  determined 

4

independently  from  Si(Li)  detectors  and  crystal  spectrometer,  are  found  in  good  agreement. 

Uncertainties on these yields are in the range between 15 to 30%. 

Fig. 2 presents the X-ray yield dependence on laser peak intensity in the case of argon clusters 

and three laser pulse durations (60, 150 and 610 fs). Similar results have been obtained with Xe 

clusters. All recorded data show the same behavior: a rapid increase of the X-ray yield above a 

well defined threshold is followed by a slower ramp accurately described by a Ipeak

3/2 law. In all 

cases, the X-ray yields can be precisely fitted by the expansion of the effective focal volume with 

the laser intensity. This effective focal volume, where, for a particular laser peak intensity (Ipeak),

the laser intensity exceeds a given threshold intensity (Ith), is given by 19

with w0, the laser beam waist. The fact that the X-ray yield follows this law suggests a constant

(or  nearly  constant)  X-ray  emission  probability  inside  this  volume,  as  soon  as  an  intensity 

threshold  is  achieved.  This  is  in  agreement  with  the  assumptions  of  the  ISI  model.  Simple 

calculations show in fact that our measurements can also be reproduced if this probability slightly 

increases  with  laser  intensity  above  the  threshold,  but  not  faster  than  linearly  17.  For  a  given 

intensity, we can calculate the number of atoms in the effective focal volume deduced from the 

measured threshold intensities. The absolute X-ray yield divided by the number of atoms gives 

the  X-ray  emission  probability  per  atom.  For  intensities  exceeding  2  or  3  times  the  threshold 

5

value (saturation regime), the mean charge state deduced from high resolution spectra is constant. 

Therefore,  assuming  a  mean  fluorescence  yield  ~  0.35  for  multiply  ionized  ions  20,  inner-shell 

ionization probabilities per atom can be estimated. Table I gives the measured threshold values 

for argon and xenon clusters, and the inferred ionization probabilities. Though more systematic 

studies are needed, a comparison of threshold values for two Ar cluster sizes differing by a factor 

~ 5 has also been performed, and exhibits a very weak dependence on this parameter. However, 

the  threshold  values  appear  to  strongly  depend  on  the  laser  pulse  duration.  A  fast  decrease, 

between 60 fs and  ~ 300 fs, is followed by an almost constant value, up to 2 ps, of ~ 2 - 3 1014

Wcm-2 (see Fig. 3). From the available data, it appears that below  ~ 300 fs, the threshold fluence

(or  energy)  remains  almost  constant.  Clearly  more  measurements  are  nevertheless  needed  to 

determine accurately this behavior. 

The  most  remarkable  result  obtained  here  is  the  unexpectedly  low  threshold  values,  up  to  two 

orders of magnitude smaller than what was predicted by the ISI model 9. Indeed, the maximum 

free  electron oscillation  energy in the  laser  field (2.Up)  may  be  as  low  as  ~ 30  eV  at threshold 

(see  Table  I).  This  is  barely  enough  to  produce  Ar1+  and  Xe2+  either  by  inelastic  electron-ion 

collisions, or even by OFI. Similarly, the electron temperatures which can be deduced from the 

nanoplasma  model  12  are  far  too  small  to  explain  inner-shell  ionization  (typical  maximum 

electron temperatures  are ~ 25 eV for a 2.8 105 atoms cluster and a  60 fs laser pulse of 2 1015

Wcm-2).  Alternative  explanations  have  to  be  considered  for  the  electron-heating  process  up  to 

keV energies. In recent experiments an anisotropic emission of fast ions has been observed 21 22.

This feature has been explained by calculations 23 24 including charge polarization of the cluster 

and field enhancement inside the cluster. This charge polarization effect follows the line of the 

6

Ignition  Ionization  Mechanism  introduced  by  Rose-Petruck  et  al.13.  Unfortunately,  quantitative 

predictions have been mainly limited so far to small ((cid:100) 1000 atoms) clusters.  

One  mechanism  which  could  account  for  the  efficient heating of  the  electrons well  beyond  the 

ponderomotive energy Up, is acceleration in the laser field by simultaneous elastic scattering at 

the core potential of cluster ions25. Elastic backscattering at the atomic potential of the ions can 

flip  the  velocity  vector  of  an  electron,  allowing  it,  with  non-negligible  probability,  to  remain 

synchronized with the alternating laser field vector. The electron will thus efficiently accumulate, 

rather than lose, momentum during subsequent laser half-cycles, thereby rapidly gaining kinetic 

energy well beyond the ponderomotive limit. This heating mechanism is closely connected to the 

Fermi shuttle acceleration26 and also to the lucky-electron model proposed for IR photoemission 

from metallic surfaces27. A realistic estimate for the efficiency of elastic electron-ion scattering as 

a  heating  mechanism  critically depends  on  a correct determination of  the  differential  scattering 

cross-section  for  large  scattering  angles.  The  latter  is  governed  by  the  short-ranged  non-

Coulombic  core  potential  leading  to  the  dominance  of  few  low-  order  partial  waves  and  to 

Ramsauer-Townsend interference oscillations. Approximations, such as the widely used softened 

Coulomb  potential2  24,  greatly  underestimate  the  probability  for  backscattering.  First  results  of 

simulations  using  scattering  cross-sections  determined  by  parametrized  Hartree-Fock  potentials 

for various charge states of cluster ions and a Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo simulation for the 

electron dynamics inside the cluster dynamics28 for large argon clusters (2.8 105 atoms) show the 

onset  of  x-ray  emission  for  short  pulses  already  in  the  low-  laser  intensity  region  (1015-1016

Wcm-2).

7

Another  important  result  is  relevant  to  the  X-ray  yield  optimization.  Since  the  X-ray  emission 

probability above the threshold appears to be constant (or almost constant), the total X-ray yield 

is strictly proportional to the effective focal volume. Depending on the threshold value and the 

maximum pulse energy available, the X-ray yield may be increased by increasing the beam waist, 

in contradiction to what could be anticipated from available models. Fig. 4, where the effective 

volume is plotted as a function of beam waist values, illustrates this behavior. 

In summary, studies of the X-ray yield dependence on laser peak intensity  have demonstrated a 

clear threshold behavior, suggesting a constant inner-shell ionization probability in the saturation 

regime. Unexpectedly low threshold values, as low as 2 1014 Wcm-2, have been measured. This 

indicates  that  ignition  of  inner-shell  ionization  immediately  follows  the  production  of  the  first 

ionic  species.  None  of  the  previously  proposed  theoretical  models  provides  a  satisfactory 

explanation  for  an  high  electron  temperature  at  such  moderate  intensities.  Large-angle 

backscattering  at  ions,  resembling  the  Fermi  shuttle,  is  proposed  as  a  new  efficient  electron 

heating process. Further experimental investigations of the X-ray yield dependence on the laser 

wavelength,  pulse  duration  as  well  as  on  the  cluster  size  are  in  progress.  In  parallel,  more 

complete tests of the dynamical simulations as a function of these parameters are planed.

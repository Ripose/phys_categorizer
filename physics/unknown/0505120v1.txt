So  we  mean  that  equations  of 
classical optics actually provide full 
phase  space  for  single  light  quanta. 
The correspondence is mutually single-
valued:  any  screen  point  reachable  by 
classical  light  is  reachable  for 
single quanta, and vice versa. 

Applying  this  observation  to 
equations for charges can not be done, 
at  least,  in  direct  way.  Quantized 
levels  of  hydrogen-like  atom  have  no 
direct analogue in classical domain. 

On  the  other  side,  an  atom  does 
not  consist  of  charges  only;  it’s  a 
compound 
and 
quantized  electromagnetic  field.  This 
complicates  the  situation,  but  we 
suggest not thinking of this.

We  simply  suggest  considering 
only  light  because  it  is  the  only 
thing that makes charges to interact.

Propagation  of  light  as  a  wave 
in  accordance  to  these  equations 
(thus  providing  superposition  of 
states)  means  some  kind  of  self-
organizational  process.  This  process 
makes  some  investigation  of  all 
possibilities  in  space-time,  but  it 
does  not  take  place  in  classical 
space-time.  In  other  words,  the 
physical  time  does  not  “tick”  while 
this process evolves. 

Waves  performing  self-organized 
search  can  be  referred  to  as  “scout 
waves”  to  distinguish  them  from 
classical  waves  which  obey  the  same 
equations.  

The  process  eventually  finishes

In  [1]  we  introduced  the  notion 
of “hidden time”. Self-organization of 
light  quanta,  resulting  in  falling 
onto some certain detector, evolves in 
this  hidden  time.  To  stay  consistent

We  realize  that  such  a  sewing 
procedure  is  somewhat  artificial.  It 
looks  as  if  a  charge  that  scatters 
light  is  described  by  some  additional 
discrete  variable  like  a  flag.  This 
flag  is  “on”  when  the  physical  time 
ticks  at  its  locus  and  is  “off” 
otherwise. 

But  we  believe  that  actually 
there  can  be  no  need  in  such  a  flag 
variable. It is known that microscopic 
events  are  actually  detected  by  some 
amplifier.  Say,  an  avalanche  of

The  theory  can  be  built  in  such 
a  way  that  detected  events  correspond 
to  a  kind  of  avalanches,  i.e.  some 
collective and self - amplifying modes 
for  charges,  starting  from  single 
electron  scattering  scout  wave.  In 
this  case  we  have  no  need  to 
distinguish  hidden  time  and  physical 

time.  Physical  (macroscopical)  time 
emerges here from microscopical time. 
When  emerged,  physical  time 
loses  back  propagation,  but  in 
principle  there’s  no  any  fundamental 
difference to microscopic time.

“interpretational 
senseless  to  us,  because  only  time 
can tell which is interpretation only 
and which is a new theory.  
We  believe  that  we  suggest  the 
 
simplest  step  in  this  direction.  It 
is  very  important  not  to  omit  the 
simplest  models  even  if  they  are 
mistaken.  The  1st  nonlinear  model  of 
turbulence  by  L.D.  Landau  [4]  was 
extremely simple and it turned out to 
be  wrong.  And  this  fallacy  was  of 
great  significance!  Science  must  be 
sure  it  does  not  miss  simplest  ways 
in building models. 
 
This  is  why  we  invite  all 
theoretical  physicists  to  show  us 
where we are deliberately wrong.

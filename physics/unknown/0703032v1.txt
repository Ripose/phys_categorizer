Abstract: Giulio Racah’s name is known world wide in physics due to the 
mathematical methods he developed that are based on tensor operators and 
continuous groups. These methods revolutionized spectroscopy, and they are 
currently essential research tools in atomic, nuclear and elementary particle 
physics. He himself applied them to modernizing theoretical atomic 
spectroscopy. Racah laid the foundations of theoretical physics in Israel. He 
educated several generations of Israeli physicists, and put Israel on the world 
map of physics. 

Introduction. Racah in Italy 

Forty-two years have passed since the untimely death of Giulio Racah (1909-1965). 

 
I. 
 
 
The present article considers Racah’s contributions to general physical theory and his 
establishment of theoretical physics as a discipline in Israel. The reader is assumed to have 
the required knowledge of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, elementary angular 
momentum and group representation theory. This Introduction briefly summarizes Racah’s 
scientific career in Italy before emigrating to Palestine. His later contributions in Jerusalem

are related in ref.1. 
 
Mechanics, at a time when modern physics began flourishing in Italy. Under the impetus of 
Corbino research groups were formed around Enrico Fermi in Rome and Enrico Persico in 
Florence, with close contact between the two. Most prominent in the Florence department 
were Bruno Rossi, Giuseppe Occhialini, Gilberto Bernardini and Giulio Racah, who 
remained life-long close friends 2,  3. Racah’s doctoral thesis (1930) on a treatment of light 
interference phenomena by Fermi’s quantum theory of radiation (no. 2 in Talmi’s list
written under Persico’s supervision. He thereafter stayed one year (1930-31) as Fermi’s 
assistant in Rome and another (1931-32) with Pauli in Z ürich. Upon his return to Italy he first 
taught theoretical Physics at the university of Florence (1932-1937) and thereafter in Pisa 
(1936-37). After coming out second in a nation-wide competition for a chair in theoretical 
physics in Palermo (1937) (See Emilio Segr è's autobiography 5) he was appointed professor 
(Professore Straordinario) in Pisa, the youngest professor there. 
 
Most of Racah’s work in Italy was in the new domains opened by quantum theory. Best 
known are his calculations of the cross section for bremsstrahlung (nos. 12 and 13 in Talmi’s 
list) and for electron-positron pair production (nos. 19 and 20) in the collisions of fast 
charged particles. The calculations were very involved, but Racah succeeded in obtaining 
analytical formulas where others obtained only approximate ones. The results are important 
for cosmic ray research. Another well known work of his (no. 25) clarifies the transformation 
properties under reflections of relativistic spin ½ particles obeying the Dirac equation, with 
applications to Majorana’s theory of the neutrino. These early works already demonstrated 
Racah’s outstanding mathematical and computational abilities and the thoroughness of his 
approach, which became characteristic features of his work. He also calculated the expected 
hyperfine structure and isotope shifts of atomic spectral lines (nos. 5, 6 and 8), discussed the 
symmetry properties of tensors using group theory (9-11, 23, 24) and kept abreast of 
developments in nuclear physics (7, 16, 17, 26). Pauli and Fermi appreciated him deeply. 
When the anti-Semitic racial laws were passed in Italy (1938) Racah was dismissed from the 
University of Pisa and applied for a professorial position at The Hebrew University of 
Jerusalem. The excellent letters of reference written on his behalf by Fermi and Pauli were 
decisive for his appointment1. 
Racah indicated6 (see also 7) that his choice of Jerusalem was due to a consultation with 
 
Dr. Augusto Levi, head of the Italian Zionist Organization, who stressed the magnitude of the 
challenge of creating theoretical physics in Jerusalem where there was none, as compared to 
a less demanding effort in an already existing department somewhere else. The support and 
encouragement obtained from the head of the World Zionist Organization, Dr. Chaim 
Weizmann1, gave Racah the final required stimulus to decide to go to Jerusalem.

Jerusalem 

Racah was appointed full professor of theoretical physics at the Hebrew University of 

 
 
Jerusalem in November 1939, and became the youngest professor there. He immigrated 
together with his mother, and was determined to become integrated fast in the new land and 
the University. He studied Hebrew intensively, and after half a year mastered it to the extent 
1. Since the 
that he could start participating in the meetings of the Senate of the University
teaching at the University is done in Hebrew he regularly attended the General Physics 
course given by Dr. Shmuel Sambursky in order to learn the required Hebrew terminology 8. 
A year after his arrival (1940-41) he already taught in Hebrew the basic theoretical courses:

Let me briefly mention some aspects of his personal life: In September 1940 Racah 
married Zmira Many, a daughter of the Supreme Court judge Malchiel Many. They had a 
daughter (1941) and two sons (1944, 1949). 
 
took a course for squad commanders and became an instructor in the use of small arms and 
field exercises 12. At the outbreak of the War of Independence in November 1947 he was

deputy commander of the Haganah forces on Mount Scopus

Arab territory. From March 1948 till the end of the War he was in command of a scientific 
unit in Jerusalem preparing munitions for the army 12, 14, 15 . He also designed conical hollow 
charges which were used against the wall of the Old City of Jerusalem when the attempt was 
made to reconquer it in July 1948 12, 15.

In the summer of 1947 two excellent students, Israel Grinfeld and Yoram 

Treves, approached me offering to publish their notes of my lectures on 
Analytical Mechanics. Having known well both of them, and realizing how much 
my students are hampered in their studies by lack of suitable textbooks on the 
subject, I welcomed the suggestion. 

 
I received the first parts of the manuscript in the fall of 1947, whereas the last 

parts were handed during hasty visits between convoys in the following winter. 
As well as being first in studies, they were also among the first who were 
deprived of their young lives defending the road to eternal Jerusalem. Israel 
Grinfeld fell in Sha'ar Hagai on February 29, 1948, and Yoram Treves fell near 
Hulda on March 31.

on it under my guidance.  

 
In addition to my lecture notes the manuscript comprised various additions 
and supplementary material, partly original and partly from the classical literature. 
We felt uneasy having to make some changes without the authors being able to 
defend their work and views. We attempted to reduce the changes to a minimum, 
in order to retain the characteristic freshness of the young authors emanating from 
every page. 

 
I am unable to mention here all those who participated in scrutinizing and 

editing the manuscript. …I deeply thank them all. 

 
I am sure the book will achieve its dual goal: being used as a basic text for 
students of Physics and Mathematics, and reminding the young students of those 
who sacrificed for the homeland both their lives and their bright future.

III. Theory of Complex Spectra  
 
 
Racah’s great original contributions to Physics are given in four classical papers 
"Theory of Complex Spectra I-IV" 17-20, published in the Physical Review during the years 
1942-49. (See also  1.) When Racah worked on them during World War II he was isolated 
from the main stream of physics for five years. These works were motivated by problems 
arising in the study of theoretical atomic spectroscopy as described in the classical book by 
Condon and Shortley "The Theory of Atomic Spectra" (TAS)
Yehiel Lehrer-Ilamed of the Soreq Nuclear Research Center, Yavne, who was Racah's 
assistant, "Condon and Shortley" was a basic text for the theoretical seminar held by Racah 
in Jerusalem.)

In the higher order approximations of perturbation theory one adds residual interactions 

values (configuration) and is degenerate in each configuration. The Pauli Exclusion Principle 
requires having atomic wfs which are antisymmetric with respect to exchange of space and 
spin coordinates of any two electrons. The simplest such wfs are Slater determinants 
constructed from the single electron wfs. As a rule, for Slater determinants the total atomic 
angular momenta L (orbital angular momentum),  S (spin) and J (total angular momentum,  J 
= L + S) are not constants of the motion, and sums of determinants are required to have these 
angular momenta well defined. 
 
neglected thus far. There is an electric component (stemming from electrostatic interaction 
between electrons) which is the main part in light atoms, and a magnetic component (spin-
orbit interaction) which becomes important in heavy atoms. In the first order approximation 
one diagonalizes the residual interaction perturbation matrix in each configuration separately, 
obtaining the eigenvalues as first order corrections to the degenerate zero order energies, and 
the eigenvectors as first order stationary states. For light atoms LS-coupling prevails and the 
stationary states have well defined L, S and J values, and a multiplet structure as given by the 
atomic vector model [TAS (Chs. VII and VIII)] which describes the experimental spectra 
rather well. The notation for an LS term is 
heavy atoms there is jj-coupling and the stationary states have well defined single-electron 
angular momenta j =  l + s and total angular momentum 
several simultaneously filling shells, other coupling schemes occur as well22.  
 
Slater calculated the perturbation matrix in a basis of Slater determinants, and obtained 
its eigenvalues without diagonalization by using the invariance of the trace of a matrix under 
a transformation of basis ("the diagonal sum rule"). Thus he obtained the spectra of 
l 1 l 2 
configurations in LS-coupling and of j 1j2 configurations in jj-coupling as given in TAS. For 
more than two electrons and higher  l  values the calculations become very lengthy. Besides, 
for configurations with more than one term (level) with the same LS(J) values the method 
gives only average energies. Spectroscopic studies by the method were restricted to simple 
spectra of 2-3 electrons or holes outside closed shells. 
 
Slater's method opened a widening unjustified gap between theoretical spectroscopy and 
experimental spectroscopists, because the latter were used to adopting the formulas of the 
vector model for interpretation, whereas the diagonal sum rule method discarded any 
physical model and was based on numerical tables which had to be calculated anew for each 
spectrum.  
Due to the spherical symmetry of the intra atomic forces the total angular momentum  J 
 
is well defined, and in many cases L and S, and other resultant angular momenta of groups of 
electrons filling the same shells, are approximately constant too. Spectroscopic calculations 
in a scheme defined by coupled angular momenta are more transparent than for Slater 
determinants and lead to physically interpretable results like the vector model. In order to 
benefit from these advantages of atomic spherical symmetry Racah in the "Theory of 
Complex Spectra" calculated the residual interactions directly in appropriate coupled 
schemes which he had defined. Additionally he developed a new mathematical discipline, the 
algebra of tensor operators, which greatly simplifies calculations in coupled schemes.

in II (and continued in III) the algebra of tensor operators and started using it in the 
calculations. He developed this algebra analogously to the algebra of vector operators in Ch. 
III of Condon and Shortley starting from the commutation relations with 
J. (According to 
Judd25 Racah considered this chapter one of the most remarkable in all of scientific 
literature.) 
A cornerstone in the development of the Algebra is a function W of six angular 
 
momenta (6-j symbol) defined as a sum of products of four vector-coupling coefficients of 
two angular momenta [II], which also gives the transformation between different coupling 
schemes of three angular momenta [III]. It is called a Racah Coefficient, and the algebra is 
generally known as Racah Algebra, sometimes also Racah-Wigner Algebra, and more 
generally Algebra of Angular Momentum. How is this algebra related to Wigner? It turns out 
that Wigner developed it from his own point of view some years before Racah, but did not 
publish the results. They were included in an anthology of basic works on angular 
momentum in quantum mechanics, published in the nineteen-sixties 26. In a short introduction 
attached to circulated copies Wigner gives credit to Racah for independently developing the 
subject and for recognizing its importance: "Fifty of the sixty-two pages of the present note 
are a verbatim copy of a manuscript that is older than the writer cares to admit. The reason 
that it has not been published before is, principally, that neither the writer, nor his colleagues 
who have read and discussed the manuscript with him, have recognized the importance of the 
concepts developed therein. The credit for developing most of these concepts independently, 
along with many other similar concepts, and for recognizing their importance, belongs 
principally to G. Racah, and also to H.A. Jahn, L. Biedenharn, W. Ufford, B.H. Flowers and 
many others. The reason that the writer's old manuscript is reproduced herewith is that he 
found it very useful in some recent calculations on tensor forces and that its point of view is 
sufficiently different from any published work to merit some interest. The preceding remarks 
on the origin of these notes should explain, on the other hand, the absence of more detailed 
references to the papers of the authors mentioned."  
 
Angular momentum algebra is currently an essential research tool in atomic, nuclear 
and elementary particle physics, where there are many coupled angular momenta (see also  1). 
It is addressed in any advanced text on quantum mechanics and in books devoted to it 
exclusively27, 28, 29, 30 . Racah together with his cousin Ugo Fano wrote on it a monograph 
32 for its systematic 
titled Irreducible Tensorial Sets

After developing the Algebra Racah showed [II] that the (2k + 1) spherical harmonics

spectroscopic community, that seems to have preferred the earlier symbols and phase 
conventions33. 
 
Ykq are components of an irreducible tensor of degree k, and 
of two such tensors. He calculated its matrix elements according to the formulas of tensor 
algebra and obtained for the two-electron electrostatic energies in both LS- and jj-coupling 
closed formulas coinciding with the results obtained before. Then he discussed the one-to-
one correspondence called particle-hole (p-h) conjugation between particle-states and hole-
states in a many-electron shell, derived the transformation law of irreducible tensors under p-
h conjugation, and calculated the term energies of the configurations d n (n = 2-5), f 3, d2p and 
d8p. In the last two configurations he compared the theoretical formulas with experimental 
spectra of TiII and NiII. Finally he proved that

scheme in dn configurations  
Calculations of atomic spectra using Racah techniques require having coupled schemes 
 
of antisymmetric states. For a compound configuration 
 of electrons in two shells such 
coupled schemes are obtainable from antisymmetric coupled schemes of the individual shells 
as antisymmetrized coupled products. The basis states of the individual partial configurations 
are called parents of the states of the compound configuration. The quantum numbers of the 
 define the compound coupled scheme [TAS (sects. 1 8 and 
parents together with 
28), DT 34 (Chs. 25 and 37)]. Racah's calculations for the two-shell configurations p 2 l [I], d2p 
and  d8p[II] were done in a scheme with well defined parents. On the other hand, for a 
configuration  l n of electrons in the same shell (equivalent electrons) antisymmetrization 
between partial groups as a rule destroys orthogonality and independence of states, and the 
concept of parents as defined above becomes meaningless.

coupled states of the first

called coefficients of fractional parentage (cfps). This is a recursive construction of an 
antisymmetric coupled scheme in a shell, starting from the known two-electron states and 
determining at each stage the cfps for given L and S values as a solution of homogeneous 
linear equations ensuring that the ensuing state is antisymmetric with respect to permutations 
of the last (n – 1, n) electron pair. When there are several independent terms with given LS 
values (which happens for  l  ≥ 2) an arbitrary orthonormal scheme might be defined for them 
by using an index (ordinal number) a
 as an additional quantum number. (For the 77 terms of 
the configurations dn there is one triple term and fourteen double ones [III].) After defining a 
scheme by fractional parentage Racah obtained relations between cfps of p-h conjugate 
configurations and calculated formulas for matrix elements of symmetric one-electron and 
two-electron tensor operators using cfps.

There is still the arbitrariness associated with the definition of the scheme (the index  a ) 
 
when there are multiple terms. In order to obtain general formulas this arbitrariness should be 
overcome. In quantum mechanics multiplicities are avoided by using a complete set of 
commuting observables. For the configurations  l n Racah added to L 2, Lz, S2 and Sz a scalar 
two-electron operator 

 counting the number of electron pairs in

The eigenvalues of Q are given by a quantum number v called seniority (v comes from 

states. 
 
vethek (seniority in Hebrew), and Q is called the seniority operator). An n-electron state of 
seniority v is obtained from a v-electron state with the same quantum numbers which does 
not contain  1S pairs, by adding 
  1S electron pairs and antisymmetrizing. The 
introduction of the seniority scheme solves the multiplicity problem for the configurations d n 
[III]. (For s n and p n there are no term multiplicities, and seniority is always a good quantum 
number which might not be introduced.) 
 
After introducing seniority Racah calculated selection rules and other properties of the 
cfps and of matrix elements of irreducible tensors in the seniority scheme, and obtained the 
electrostatic interaction matrices between the configurations dn, dn – 1s and dn – 2s2.

continuous groups. The f n configurations 
For  fn configurations the method of the last section for obtaining cfps is too clumsy. 
 
Besides, for fn the operators L 2, Lz, S2, Sz and Q are not a complete set and cannot uniquely 
define a scheme by fractional parentage. (Of the 648 terms with well defined values of L, S 
and v 167 terms have two- to five-fold multiplicities36). 
Racah struggled with this problem for several years. Then he found in IV a solution 
 
based on the theory of continuous groups, which he avoided using in I-III because they were 
not a part of the standard equipment of theoretical physicists at that time [TAS 
(Introduction)]. (Racah told Pais 37 that he acquired the required knowledge of continuous 
groups by studying in Jerusalem during a whole year Herman Weyl's book The Theory of 
Groups and Quantum Mechanics 38.) He introduced in the f n configuration space a scheme of 
basis states belonging to unitary irreducible representations (irreps) of a chain of semi-simple 
continuous groups, each of which is a subgroup of the preceding group in the chain. Racah 
established the chain from groups of unitary transformations in the space spanned by the 2 l  
+ 1 single-electron wfs 
. As the largest group he chose the unitary group U(2 l  + 1). It 
has as subgroups the orthogonal group O(2 l  + 1) which leaves invariant the symmetric S

39. The foundations of the modern approach 

After defining the scheme Racah showed that in the above scheme the cfps are products 

quantum numbers when required. The new scheme almost completely overcomes the term 
multiplicity problem for fn: of the above 648 multiple terms there are only 29 pairs having the 
same values of  WULS36. They all have high excitation energies and low spins, and as a rule 
are unknown experimentally. 
 
of three factors depending each on only part of the scheme quantum numbers (quantum 
numbers of two neighbouring groups in the chain:  S W,  WU and  Ua L), which simplifies 
their calculation, and gave numerical tables of the factors. Then he wrote the Slater 
 where the  E i are 
expansion of the electrostatic energy 
linear combinations of the F k and the e i are corresponding combinations of the f k, which are 
generalized irreducible tensors with respect to the groups O(7), G 2 and O(3). Using theorems 
of tensor algebra and cfp values he obtained numerical tables enabling one to calculate the 
electrostatic energy matrices of all fn terms. 
 
This completed the definition of coupled schemes and the calculation of electrostatic 
energies for all  l n configurations (sn, pn, dn and fn). It marked a dramatic breakthrough in the 
development of theoretical atomic spectroscopy from Slater's numerical method 
(determinantal wfs, the diagonal sum rule) to the comprehensive mathematical scheme used 
today (tensor operators, fractional parentage, chains of continuous groups, creation and 
annihilation operators in second quantization)
were laid down by Racah in the Theory of Complex Spectra. De-Shalit and Talmi [DT (p. 8. 
Quoted in sect. VI below)] have considered him the founder of Modern Spectroscopy, both 
atomic and nuclear. 
 
Racah summarized his methods on the use of group theory in spectroscopy in a series 
of seminar lectures he gave in spring 1951 at The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, 
where he was invited to stay on a sabbatical (1950-51) by Oppenheimer. The first three parts 
of the lectures address general notions on continuous groups, classification of the semi-
simple groups, and their representations. The last two parts extend results from the Theory of 
Complex Spectra to the rapidly developing nuclear shell model 40: The fourth part addresses 
the classification and calculation of nuclear states of mixed shells of neutrons and protons 
with isospin and seniority in LS-coupling. The fifth part treats the classification of nuclear 
interactions according to their tensorial character, and the calculation of the energy matrix for 
central interactions in dn configurations. During the following decade the symmetry approach 
in elementary particle physics was developed, and in hindsight it has become clear that the 
first three to four parts of Racah's lectures contain all the necessary tools needed for the 
formulation of this approach 41, 42 . The notes taken from the lectures were in demand ever 
since: they were mimeographed many times, reproduced as a CERN report (CERN 61-8, 
43. 
Geneva, 1961), and finally published in the series Springer Tracts in Modern Physics
Racah himself hardly participated in the research on particle symmetries, and in the nineteen-
44 (see also  41 and 
fifties considered it "mathematical games people play with group theory"
sect. V. C). 
 
IV. Calculation and Interpretation of Atomic Spectra  
 
A.  Extent of the calculations in Jerusalem  
 
Racah had a long-range aim of obtaining theoretical understanding of all measured 
atomic spectra4, 45. Out of 58 M.Sc. theses and 15 Ph.D. theses written under his supervision 
in Jerusalem, respective 46 and 8 theses comprised theoretical analyses of experimental 
46 (7) . Before 1954 the calculations were made using 
atomic spectra using his methods
mechanical calculators (Odhner and later also Madas), and the studied spectra were relatively 
simple, with energy matrices that could be diagonalized with these calculators (matrices of

24.). Due to collaboration with William Meggers, 

In first order perturbation theory the energies and stationary states are calculated for 

orders 23 and 25 were already too large
Chief of the Spectroscopy section of the Atomic and Radiation Physics Division of the 
National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Washington, D.C., and Richard Trees of the NBS, it 
became possible for the first time in 1954 to diagonalize such matrices by the electronic 
24, 47 . In 1957 the electronic 
computer SEAC at the Computation Laboratory of the NBS
computer WEIZAC was installed at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, and the 
department of theoretical physics in Jerusalem started using it routinely for theoretical 
analysis of spectra 48, 49 . (A lively description of the work at the WEIZAC is given by 
Shadmi45.) After the WEIZAC was closed in 1963, the Department started using the 
PHILCO 2000 electronic computer of the Ministry of Defence, and in 1965 changed to the 
IBM 7040 computer newly acquired by The Hebrew University. The use of electronic 
computers made it possible to choose the spectra for study according to their interest rather 
than practical possibilities. During the nineteen-fifties and early nineteen-sixties the spectra 
studied in the Department were mainly complex spectra with filling d shells (the Iron, 
Palladium and Platinum groups) 50, and increasingly so the even more complex spectra with 
filling f shells in the rare earths.51 There were also a few isolated studies of Actinide spectra. 
 
B.  Configuration interaction  
 
each configuration separately (sect. III.A). In higher orders there are additional contributions 
from other configurations, due to the non-diagonal part of the residual interaction between 
different configurations. This is called configuration interaction (CI). When the distances 
between the unperturbed energies of two configurations are large as compared to the 
magnitudes of the residual interaction matrix elements connecting the two, the perturbation 
series converges fast and low-order terms are sufficient. On the other hand, when the non-
diagonal matrix elements are relatively large convergence is slow. Then, rather than using the 
perturbation series, neighbouring configurations are treated as an extended degenerate 
configuration [TAS (sect. 10 2)], for which the energies and stationary states are obtained by 
diagonalizing an extended perturbation matrix in the extended degenerate space. 
 
For the transition elements the pairs of states 4s and 3d, 5s and 4d and 6s and 5d have 
rather close single-electron energies. Therefore there is CI between close low configurations 
dn,  dn-1s and  d n-2s2. Similarly, for the rare earths the states 6s, 5d and 4f have rather close 
single-electron energies and there is CI between low configurations f ndk, fndk-1s and f ndk-2s2, 
and also between low configurations of the opposite parity f n-1dk+1, fn-1dks and fn-1dk-1s2. (The 
parity of a configuration is even or odd according to whether 
electromagnetic forces there is CI only between configurations of the same parity.) 
 
meaningless. Additionally there are several interactions with similar strengths, which 
obliterates coupling schemes. Under these circumstances the vector model is not applicable, 
and close cooperation between experimental and theoretical spectroscopists is called for. 
Racah and his collaborators fully responded to the challenge24, 52, 53, 54, 55 . 
 
When the number of interacting configurations becomes high the density of spectral 
lines increases, and it becomes experimentally difficult to identify distinct energy levels by 
the traditional method of looking for repeated constant values of sums and differences of the 
spectral lines (Ritz Combination Principle (1908) [TAS (Introduction)]). This is the problem 
of accidental coincidences in the classification of spectral lines. The difficulty might be 
alleviated by taking sums and differences for pairs of a spectral line and the energy of an 
already known level, rather than for pairs of spectral lines, because in a dense spectrum the 
23, 24  that the 
number of levels is much smaller than the number of lines. Racah maintained
main obstacle to a complete understanding of the rare earths spectra is the paucity of known

 (the Trees correction). (A similar correction was 

As a rule, diagonalization of the energy matrix in spaces comprising neighbouring 

Racah tried explaining the Trees correction as a second order perturbation 63, assuming 

Such systematic deviations were first found by Trees in 1951 61, 62 in the configurations 

levels, and he started doing classifications together with his students23, 56, 57 . At the same time 
this method started being used also at the NBS
establishment in Harwell60.

that the correction for an n-electron configuration is the sum of separate electron pair 
corrections (linear theory), each of which can be accounted for exactly by adding intra-
configuration two-electron effective interactions: a L(L + 1) for p 2 with three terms 1S, 3P and 
1D and two Slater parameters  F 0 and  F 2,  a L(L + 1) +  b Q for  d 2 with five terms and three

coupling, but with minor modifications the proof holds for atoms in LS-coupling as well. 
(See also 65.)) 
The complete second order perturbation correction to the terms of  l n due to CI with far 
 
away configurations was first calculated explicitly by Rajnak and Wybourne 66. They showed 
that CI contributions due to two-electron excitations are given by expectation values in  l n of 
two-particle intra-configuration effective operators, and single-electron excitations lead to 
both two- and three-particle intra- l n effective operators. Racah and his Ph.D. student Joseph 
67 by using "curtailed" 
Stein reached the same conclusion in a simpler and clearer way
operators which are essentially coupled products of creation and annihilation operators in 
second quantization, thus avoiding the lengthy summations over intermediate states of the 
perturbing configurations. For more complex excitations they obtained four-particle effective 
interactions as well. 
The advantages of using intra-configuration effective interactions rather than the 
 
traditional inter-configuration perturbation expansion are that the order of the energy matrix 
does not change and only a few parameters are added. 
 
The close agreement between theory and experiment achieved in Jerusalem since the 
nineteen-fifties has to a large extent been due to the consistent use of effective interactions 50, 
51.

D.  Semiempirical methods 
 
In theoretical spectroscopy the calculation of atomic energies and stationary states is 
done by diagonalizing the energy matrix (sect. III.A) including effective interactions, after 
substituting appropriate numerical values for the radial and effective interaction parameters. 
The traditional method used by Racah and his collaborators for obtaining these values is the 
semiempirical statistical one: For a spectrum comprising N energy levels depending on the 
values of m independent (radial and effective) parameters, the numerical values of the 
parameters are determined by adjusting them in such a way that the overall mean error 
 of 
the calculated energies when compared to the data becomes as small as possible ("method of

large enough compared to the number m of adjustable parameters. For single atoms or ions 
this limits the analysis to spectra with sufficiently many levels. In the mid nineteen-fifties it 
was found that the same parameters in neighbouring atoms or ions satisfy simple (linear or 
quadratic) interpolation formulas as functions of the number of electrons in the shell and the 
degree of ionization 24, 68, 69 . This highly reduces the number of independent parameters as 
compared to the number of levels, and allows a simultaneous treatment of a group of atoms 
and ions with the same filling valence shells, with resulting high predictive power for 
unknown levels and even unknown complete spectra belonging to the same group. The 
method was developed and elaborated in Jerusalem 48, 49 and led to impressive progress in the 
analysis of transition elements and rare earths spectra. The difficulties encountered in the 
application of the iterative diagonalization – least squares procedure to complex spectra are 
detailed in 51. 
 
The Landé g-factors of the levels are determined empirically from the level splittings in 
a magnetic field. They depend strongly on the multiplet composition of the states [TAS (sect. 
316)] and can be used for checking the level assignments in each step of the iterations. In the 
last year of his life Racah planned quantifying the above use of g-factors by extending the 
diagonalization – least squares procedure to level energies and g-factors simultaneously. 
Then the problem arose of what are the appropriate relative weights for the two kinds of data. 
Racah gave a seminar talk about it in Jerusalem, and intended addressing it in his prospected 
talk at the Zeeman Centennial Conference in Amsterdam70, as given in the book of abstracts: 

"Contributed Papers, Section A 
14.00-14.15 

G. Racah,* Hebrew University, Jerusalem 

The Use of Zeeman Data in theoretical Calculations of Atomic Spectra  

A method has been developed for fitting by least squares to the theoretical 
formulas the measured g-factors of atomic levels together with the energy values. 
The advantages and limitations of the method will be discussed. 
* Deceased August 1965." 
It seems that no convincing solution to the weights problem was found, and the 

plan has not materialized25.

Thus the department of theoretical physics in Jerusalem became a world center for 

 
E.  Collaborations and international commissions  
 
The "Theory of Complex Spectra" and the activities in Jerusalem made Racah "the 
principal figure in Theoretical Atomic Physics until his untimely death in 1965" (Judd) 25. His 
methods and notations dominated the field. At the Rydberg Centennial Conference in Lund 
(1954) he delivered a key lecture on the state and problems of the theory of atomic spectra 24. 
In 1955 he became a member of commission 14 (on Standards of Wave Lengths and Tables 
of Spectra) of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), and of the Joint Commission for 
Spectroscopy (JCS) of the IAU and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics 
(IUPAP). In 1960 the JCS was transformed into the Triple Commission for Spectroscopy 
(TCS) of the IAU, IUPAP and the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry 
(IUPAC), of which Racah became a corresponding member
1958 the JCS decided to set up two clearing houses for atomic wfs, one for radial functions at 
MIT (Coster) and another for angular functions in Jerusalem (Racah), which should be able 
to give all information on work going on and prevent overlapping of activities by giving 
sufficient publicity to their existence 72. (see also  48.) This activity continued in Jerusalem 
until 196373. 
 
atomic spectroscopy and collaborated closely with other centers. We mentioned the 
collaboration with the NBS (sects. IV.A and IV.B). In the Summer of 1960 Racah was at the 
NBS on sabbatical and worked on rare earths spectra. In 1962 he obtained from the NBS a 
three-year research grant for calculations of atomic spectra, particularly for rare earths
and he visited the NBS as an adviser 53. The grant was extended for another year prior to its 
termination. At the same time he obtained a two-year grant for research on atomic spectra 
from the U.S. Air Force.46(3), 65 
 
agreement between France and Israel Racah gave at the College de France in February 1964 
a series of lectures on the theory of atomic spectra 33, emphasizing the theory of configuration 
interaction and the special problems facing the analysis and interpretation of rare earths 
spectra. The lectures were highly appreciated 10 (Chabbal's letter to Racah of 17.4.1964). A 
collaborative research was agreed on, and by the end of 1964 Chabbal's student Yves 
Bordarier came to Jerusalem for three months, planning a longer visit in the following year 
1965-66 when Racah would have completed his service as rector of the university.   After 
Racah's death Bordarier came to Jerusalem for several few-months research visits74.

recognition of their importance came from nuclear physics. After World War II, nuclear 
physics flourished in an increasing number of laboratories. Tensor algebra is the natural 
mathematical tool for treating angular correlations of successive nuclear radiations, as shown 
first by Racah 75 and independently by Lloyd 76. Additionally it was found 77 that the neutrons 
and protons in the nucleus are filling shells similarly to the atomic electrons, and the methods 
developed by Racah for atomic spectroscopy are adaptable to the nuclear shell model, as 
shown by Racah himself for nuclear p n configurations in I but not pursued further until the 
revival of the nuclear shell model in the late nineteen-forties. In this connection Telegdi has 
recalled78: "The other thing I would like to say, which is perhaps more pertinent to the 
historian. I once asked Giulio Racah in 1950 or so why he was working on the spectrum of

Calculations of angular correlations and of nuclear structure require large numbers of 

iron, a very esoteric thing, instead of working on nuclei. And he said to me, "You see, when I 
was young in 1937, Wigner and Hund wrote two fundamental papers in nuclear physics 
which are full of group theory, and I liked that and I studied those papers and learned the 
methods. But then I wanted to apply them to nuclear physics, and I found that nothing was 
known about nuclei. So I started applying those methods to atomic spectra where there was 
some evidence and I stuck with it." He had all this grandiose machinery but no nuclear levels 
were known. So this may be very characteristic." 
 
numerical values of Racah coefficients and related functions. The first numerical tables
were calculated by using mechanical calculators, but shortly after that more extensive and 
error-free tables 82-84 were calculated by using electronic computers. The availability of 
comprehensive tables made possible the extension of the use of Racah's methods to various 
domains (including atomic spectroscopy!). 
 
B.  Seniority schemes with isospin in the nuclear shell model  
 
For charge-independent nuclear forces the total isospin T is well defined. It determines 
the permutational symmetry of the space-spin wf, and its component  T z is half the nuclear 
neutron excess

(gs) value of T is as a rule the lowest possible one, namely 
, which 
corresponds to the highest possible number of neutron-proton pairs in  T 12 = 0 states. This 
reflects the stronger attraction of a neutron-proton pair in T = 0 as compared to T = 1 states85. 
 
In the nucleus there is an attractive spin-orbit interaction which increases in heavy 
nuclei. In the light nuclei of the 1p valence shell the coupling scheme is near LS, and it 
changes to jj in heavier nuclei40. 
 
l n shells in LST-coupling. In addition to the 
configurations in LS-coupling to mixed 
quantum numbers vLM LSMS of the electronic seniority scheme there are the two isospin 
quantum numbers TM T and three partition quantum numbers PP'P'' determining the 
permutational symmetry of the space and the spin-isospin wfs (respective irrep of U(2 l  + 1) 
and SU(4)). There is also a third isospin quantum number called reduced isospin and denoted 
t (see below). 
 
generalized seniority scheme to obtain complete classification of states and numerical tables 
of cfps for nuclear d n and p n configurations, and the energy matrix of central-interactions for 
dn 86-88 . Racah calculated numerical tables enabling one to calculate the energy matrix of 
central interactions for pn  89 and used them together with his M.Sc. student Nissan Zeldes to 
explain the difference in gs spins of 6Li and 10B assuming intermediate coupling90, 91. 
 
gs = 0, 
In heavier nuclei with jj-coupling the gs spins of even-even nuclei are always  J
and spherical odd-A nuclei have as a rule J gs = j. This systematics corresponds to the highest 
possible number of identical-nucleon pairs in  J
12 = 0 states (the single-particle model of 
Mayer and Jensen 92), reflecting the fact that the only strongly bound state of two identical 
nucleons in a j shell has J12 = 0 85.

Analogously to the atomic case in LS-coupling the seniority scheme for nuclei in JT-
coupling is obtainable by introducing basis states belonging to irreps of a chain of unitary 
transformations in the 2j + 1 dimensional space of single nucleon wfs

numbers T and J, and the irreps of  S p(2j + 1) by the pair of quantum numbers (v, t). The 
definition of the nuclear seniority scheme for jj-coupling by the above group chain was first 
given by Flowers95, and independently by Racah96. 
 
There are two significant differences between the atomic seniority scheme in LS-
coupling and the nuclear seniority scheme in JT-coupling. The first difference is related to 
the different nature of the interactions: the low atomic states hardly contain  1S electron pairs 
due to the strong repulsive interaction of the latter, and the atomic seniority scheme is not 
based on symmetry (non-symmetry or non-invariance group), and is not a realistic scheme. 
(See also Hund's rule [TAS 6 7].) On the other hand, nucleons tend to couple in J = 0 pairs 
(the single particle model 92) and the nuclear seniority scheme is based on an approximate 
symmetry, where the gs and low excited states of spherical nuclei have low seniority93, 95, 96.

 added  1S 
atomic case there is no multiplicity corresponding to

such interactions the excitation energy of states of given seniority is n-independent. Racah 
and Talmi showed that an interaction which is a sum of scalar products of odd-degree 
irreducible tensors has the pairing property. In particular this is the case for the delta 
interaction and for (dipole-dipole) Tensor Forces. 
 
C.  Nuclear masses of lowest seniority states 
 
Edmonds and Flowers studied for  j
spectrum on the range of the force for two-nucleon central interactions. They did it by 
diagonalizing for various values of the range the calculated energy matrices for j values 
between j 
 and for (2-3 identical nucleons with) 
that for short range forces the energies increase with T, for a given T they increase with v, 
and for given T and v they increase when t decreases. Racah 96 reached the same conclusions 
without matrix diagonalization by elegantly obtaining from group theory an expression for 
the average energy of a given irrep of S p(2j + 1) and comparing the averages, which for short 
range forces are close to the individual levels. Moreover, for the one-dimensional irreps with 
v = 0 (for even n) and v = 1 (for odd n) he obtained in this way explicit expressions (a mass

component of the semiempirical lowest-seniority shell model mass equation 99. He did also a

nineteen-fifties it was applied by Talmi and his students at the Weizmann Institute of 
Science, and Talmi described the work in the Rehovoth Conference on Nuclear Structure 
(1957) 100. Contrary to Racah's detailed studies of atomic spectra, his work in nuclear physics 
was on general problems, avoiding detailed analysis of data. Only one of his nuclear physics 
papers written in Jerusalem addresses a specific spectroscopic problem 90. Of the M.Sc. and 
Ph.D. theses in nuclear physics written under his supervision in Jerusalem there are two more

"… since I am more familiar with the mathematics than with the physics of 
Nuclear Spectroscopy, it was not an easy task for me to organize the programme 
for this course; however I did my best, which means that I tried to find the best…" 

When I was his Ph.D. student (1952-1956) I asked Racah about it. He answered that 

He himself gave the lectures on Mathematical Techniques64. 
 
beyond a certain age the human mind is not flexible enough for mastering a new domain and 
doing creative work in it, whereas in familiar domains one can still continue making 
significant contributions. We discussed together the theoretical aspects of my work, but for

Physics (1954)113: 

Ever since the Theory of Complex Spectra Racah continued thinking about the problem 

"A search for new quantum numbers in nuclear configurations 
Giulio Racah 
The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 
Coefficients of fractional parentage and energy matrices have been calculated in 
the last few years for many nuclear configurations, and the results were expressed 
in numerical tables which became bigger and bigger when the configurations 
became more complex. It is therefore natural to ask whether it is possible to give 
general formulae for these matrix elements, as functions of the quantum numbers 
of the states to which they belong. But it is impossible even to try to solve this 
problem, before we have a  complete set of quantum numbers for characterizing 
the different states of a given configuration of equivalent nucleons. 
 
The group-theoretical classification of the states of 
years ago (Racah, 1951), still contains three running indices, 
distinguishing different states having the same conventional quantum numbers; 
and it is now necessary to substitute these running indices by "quantum numbers", 
or sets of quantum numbers, which have some physical or mathematical meaning.

Racah was much occupied 114, 115 with the group chain

the nuclear seniority scheme, attempting to overcome the multiplicity problem related to the 
freedom in choosing the value of t 0, the isospin of the added J = 0 nucleon pairs (sect. V.B). 
He thought of introducing a hermitian operator related to t 0 and commuting with the scheme 
operators, and using its eigenvalues as new quantum numbers. On physical grounds he chose 
R
, but could not find a mathematical connection between  R and t0. Racah's 
Ph.D. student, Haim Goldberg 110, approached the problem from a group-theoretical point of 
view and introduced instead of  t 0 the number  n a  of alpha particles in a state with given vtT 
quantum numbers, where an alpha particle is defined as a four-nucleon antisymmetrized J = 
T = 0 coupled product of two J = 0, T = 1 two-nucleon states. Heuristically

The  na  together with vtT make possible a complete definition of scheme, but unlike in 
quantum mechanics states belonging to different  n

commuting operators rather than eigenstates of the same operator belonging to different 
eigenvalues. Using the new scheme for spectroscopic calculations would require the 
development of new algebraic techniques.

VI. Teaching  
 
 
Racah was an excellent teacher. He took the subject matter of the courses he taught 
very seriously and approached it directly, logically and clearly, emphasizing the physical 
aspects. He was always enthusiastic about what he taught (see also  4, 8, 33, 45 ). His lectures at 
scientific conferences22, 24, 65, 115, 118
, his Varenna 64 and Princeton 43 lectures, and the book 
Irreducible Tensorial Sets 31 are masterpieces of arrangement of the material and clarity of 
presentation. 
 
their research problems for hours, and enthusiastically would tell them about the problems he 
was working on and the results he had obtained. Thus many of the best students were 
attracted to him, and during the fifteen years when he was the only theoretical physicist in the 
country (until the arrival of Nathan Rosen at the Technion in Haifa (1954) 119) he established 
an Israeli school in theoretical physics, which mastered his methods and applied them in 
various domains. Zvi Lipkin has described the characteristic features of the Israeli school 
which impressed him upon arrival at the Weizmann Institute in the early nineteen fifties120: 

Similarly, Racah always took his students very seriously. He would discuss with them

"The useful era of quantum mechanics began in the early 50's with the 
development of the nuclear shell and collective models and of modern solid state 
physics where quantum mechanics found extensive use as a basic tool without the 
necessity to solve the deep problems of ultraviolet divergences. During this period 
I worked at the Weizmann Institute in Israel and was much influenced by the 
Israeli School of Physics with its pragmatic use of highly sophisticated but down-
to-earth theory to describe the real world of experimental data. I should like to

thank my friends and colleagues in Rehovoth who helped to teach me in this 
period that quantum mechanics could be useful and that many apparently 
complicated and sophisticated formal descriptions were in reality based on very 
simple physics." 
In the introduction to their book on the nuclear shell model [DT (p. 8)], Amos de-
 
Shalit and Igal Talmi, two of Racah's students, have emphasized their indebtedness to 
him for having introduced them to his methods and for his published as well as 
unpublished contributions to the subject matter of the book: 

 "We would only like to refer in particular to the work of G. Racah who can be 
justly called the founder of modern spectroscopy. The authors are greatly indebted 
to him for having introduced them to his methods. Much of the material presented 
in this book is due to him directly as well as indirectly." 

 
VII. University and Nation-wide Activities  
 
 
Racah was a strong and active person, with outstanding organizational abilities. 
He was a leading member in various committees of the university and the senate 121, 122 
and held key administrative positions in the university. In his last years he was rector 
(1961-1965) and acting president (1961-1962) 46. During his term in office the science 
faculty which had been scattered in various buildings in Jerusalem since the War of 
Independence became accommodated together at the Givat Ram campus. A similar 
transition of the medical school to the Ein Kerem campus was completed. Furthermore, 
intensive efforts were made to develop all the sciences. Additionally, the University 
started cultural cooperation with developing countries by teaching the premedical 
courses to students from Asian and African countries in English 46 (5), 123. 
 
Racah was among the founders of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities 
(1959) and was the head of the committee that prepared its constitution, and became the 
first chairman of its Natural Sciences Division (1960-1963). He was among the 
founders of the Israel Physical Society and its first president (1954-1956). He was a 
member of The Scientific Council attached to the Prime Minister's Office (later The 
National Council for Research and Development) from its inception on (1949). He was 
a member of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission (1952-1955) and a member of 
Israel delegations to the first three Geneva conferences (1955, 1958, 1964) on the 
peaceful uses of atomic energy. He was a member of the scientific committee of the 
Ministry of Defense (1948-1952), and due to his initiative there 124, 125  five of the best 
physics students (U. Haber-Schaim, G. Yekutieli, I. Pelah, A. de-Shalit and I. Talmi) 
were sent abroad after the War of Independence to learn nuclear physics and establish 
nuclear research in Israel in preparation for the developments of the nuclear era.  Later 
(1954) 125 these physicists started nuclear physics studies at the Weizmann Institute, and 
made it a world center for the nuclear shell model. The group at Rehovot and the 
department of theoretical physics in Jerusalem kept regular contacts by holding a 
common weekly seminar at the Weizmann Institute125 (see also 114). 
 
of the Weizmann Institute (1959) and an Honorary Doctor of Science of Manchester 
University (1961), and was elected an Honorary Foreign Member of the American 
Academy of Arts and Sciences (1963). He received the Weizmann Prize in the Natural 
Sciences of Tel Aviv municipality (1954), the Bublick Prize for Science of The Hebrew 
University (1955), the Israel Prize for Natural Sciences (1958) and the Rothschild Prize 
(1962). He was also made Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic 

 In recognition of his scientific achievements Racah became an Honorary Fellow

In his lifetime Racah was the only full professor in theoretical physics in 

(1965). After his death the IAU named a crater on the moon after him (1971)
Israel Philatelic Service issued a postage stamp of NIS 0.80 with his portrait (1993). 
 
Approaching the end of his term as rector of the university Racah was full of 
plans for resuming his scientific research which had suffered badly during that period. 
He intended to attend the Zeeman Centennial Conference on Atomic Spectroscopy in 
Amsterdam70 together with his theoretical spectroscopy group (Goldschmidt, Shadmi 
and Stein). Two days after departing from Israel he died in his family house in Florence 
from asphyxiation due to a faulty gas heater. 
 
Jerusalem. At the end of the period the department included as well an associate 
professor, a senior lecturer and a lecturer in nuclear physics (G. Rakavy, N. Zeldes and 
I. Unna), and a lecturer and an instructor in atomic spectroscopy (Y. Shadmi and Z.B. 
Goldschmidt). In 1970 the departments of experimental and theoretical physics were 
united as The Racah Institute of Physics.

Abstract

We describe how we can precisely measure variations in the entropy S of small solid

samples  below  room  temperature,  as  a  function  the  temperature  T  or  the  external

magnetic  field  H,  respectively.  A  simple  differential-thermal  analysis  (DTA)  tech-

nique allows, in principle, for the measurement of variations in S without any instru-

mental broadening of the data. The method is particularly well suited for the detection

of sharp phase transitions in samples of milligram size.

Key words:

Thermal analysis, DTA, phase transitions

I. Introduction

Differential-thermal analysis (DTA) is widely used in chemical and material sciences

for investigating the thermodynamics of chemical reactions and phase transitions1. In

most cases, DTA measurements are used to qualitatively detect abrupt changes in the

thermodynamic properties of a sample above room temperature. We have earlier ex-

tended this method to measure heat capacities of small samples below room tempera-

ture2,  and  observed,  as  a  result,  novel  electronic  phase  transitions  in  superconduc-

tors3,4,5,6. In this work we show that the same method can be used to directly measure

variations in entropy S as a function of the temperature T or the magnetic field H, re-

spectively.  In  contrast  to  corresponding  heat-capacity  C  data  obtained  by  the  same

technique,  variations  in  S  can  be  measured  without  introducing  any  instrumental

broadening to the data. Therefore, the novel method of data analysis represents an ex-

cellent  tool  for  the  detection  of  very  sharp  phase  transitions,  e.g.,  first-order  phase

transitions.

In this article we will first give a brief summary of the hardware requirements and the

conditions  under  which  the  method  is  applicable.  We  then  summarize  our  previous

approach to determine heat capacities using DTA techniques and show how to extract

variations in S directly from such DTA data. We finally present selected results from

DTA experiments around first-order and second-order phase transitions in the super-

conductors YBa2Cu3O7 and V3Si, respectively.

II. Hardware and data analysis

A. Hardware and instrumentation

A typical schematic view of a DTA set-up is shown in Fig. 1. A sample and a refer-

ence sample of comparable heat capacity are thermally linked to a large thermal re-

servoir, the temperature of which can be varied as a function of time. Our measure-

ments  are  done  under  high-vacuum  conditions  and  typically  at  temperatures  below

120  K,  which  allows  for  an  accurate  control  of  the  heat  links.  We  assume  here  that

these heat links ks and kr that connect the sample (at a temperature Ts) and the refer-

ence  sample  (temperature  Tr),  respectively,  with  the  thermal  reservoir  (temperature

Tb), obey Fourier’s law for the transport of heat, i.e., we are using the fact that the rate

of heat flow P is proportional to the temperature difference between the warm and the

cold end of each heat link, 

Pr,s

= kr,s(Tb

- Tr,s) (in the following, the subscripts r and/or

s denote “reference side” and/or “sample side” ). This is certainly fulfilled if the heat

links consist of a metallic wire, the thermal conductivity of which does not vary sig-

(cid:160) 

nificantly  within  the  temperature  interval  defined  by  Ts,  Tr,  and  Tb  (at  high  enough

temperatures,  thermal  radiation  may  also  have  to  be  taken  into  account,  see  Ref.  2,

section IIc). This temperature interval is determined by2

with  the  heat  capacities  Cr  and  Cs  of  the  reference  sample  and  the  sample,  respec-

(cid:160) 

tively, the addenda heat capacity CA, and the time constants 

= (Cr,s

+ CA ) /kr,s. The

r,s

values for the heat links, ks and kr, can be estimated from the thermal conductivities,

the cross sections and the lengths of the connections used to form the heat links, and

(cid:160) 

may  include  contributions  from  wires  to  the  thermometers  and  from  the  mechanical

suspension of the samples. In typical experiments, we had (Tb–Tr,s)/Tb »

 0.5 - 3%. The

3

t
time constants t

r,s can be directly measured by monitoring the relaxation of Ts and Tr

as a function of time following a heat pulse. These t

r,s data (as functions of tempera-

ture) can later be used to calculate the variations in specific heat and entropy. In our

experiments we have typical values t

r,s »

 40 -350 sec and heating rates of the order of

.

Tb

» 1- 20   mK /sec .

The  size  of  the  sample,  its  thermal  anchoring  to  the  sample  thermometer  and  the

(cid:160) 

thermometers themselves have to be chosen in a way that the internal thermal equilib-

rium and response times are much smaller than t

r,s and smaller than the inverse data-

acquisition rate (in our case 3 sec) to guarantee that the Ts and Tr data are not unneces-

sarily  broadened  by  an  internal  equilibrium  process.  As  a  general  trend,  a  thermal

equilibrium  in  most  solids  is  achieved  faster  at  low  temperatures  than  at  room  tem-

perature or above, which makes the use of a DTA technique at low temperatures par-

ticularly attractive. For our samples (typically a few milligrams) we estimate the re-

spective internal thermal equilibrium times to be of the order of 0,1 sec or less.

As in any thermal experiment, thermometers and wiring should contribute as little as

possible to the total heat capacity. We have built various versions of DTA cells using

thermocouples and small platinum PT-100 or Cernox 1050 chip resistors. For a quan-

titative analysis, the corresponding addenda heat capacities CA and the reference heat

capacity Cr have to be known (see below). These quantities, together with kr,s, can be

reasonably accurately measured using the T-dependent t

r,s(T) data and by performing

an  additional  experiment  at  constant Tb,  where  the  sample  and  the  reference  sample

are heated with a known constant heating power Pr,s, thereby raising their respective

temperatures by the asymptotic values 

(Tr,s

- Tb ) = Pr,s / kr,s

= Pr,s

r,s /(Cr,s

+ CA ).

(cid:160)

t
The relative sensitivity of both the heat capacity and the entropy data depend crucially

on  the  sensitivity  of  the  sample  thermometers  and  of  the  way 

D T = Ts

- Tr  is  meas-

ured. Above 50 K we achieved our best results with copper-constantan thermocouples

(cid:160) 
and platinum thermometers (with a typical scattering in 

D T  of the order of 10–4 K and

10–6 K, respectively), and at lower temperatures using Cernox thermometers (10–4 K).

To improve the performance of the resistance thermometers, we applied in some cases

(cid:160) 

a deliberately high measuring current that induced a significant self-heating of the or-

der of 1 K or less. This is not a real problem for the present DTA technique, however,

as long as the temperature of the sample is known, the self-heating effect is symmetri-

cal on the sample and the reference sides, respectively, and the quantity

Tb–Tr that is later used in the analysis is calculated from t

 (note that the thus

obtained  Tb–Tr,s values at large measuring current do not represent the true tempera-

ture  differences  between  the  sample  thermometers  and  the  thermal  reservoir  during

.

Tb
r,s and 
(cid:160) 

(cid:160) 

the experiment).

The quantity 

D T  contains the essential information on abrupt changes in Cs and in the

associated  entropy  (see  below).  It  can  be  measured  very  accurately  in  a  differential

(cid:160) 

configuration, either as a voltage difference from a differential-thermocouple pair, or

as  the  voltage  difference  between  the  centers  of  two  branches  of  a  Wheatstone-like

resistance bridge that is configured with two calibrated resistance thermometers (one

on  the  sample  and  one  on  the  reference  side)  and  two  known  reference  resistors.  In

our experiments, these DC voltage differences were amplified using a Keithley 1801

preamplifier and measured with a Keithley 2001 voltmeter.

In the following we assume that the quantities t

r(T), Cr(T) and CA(T) have been mea-

sured in a separate experiment and are free of any discontinuities. These values have

5

to be determined only once since they are not expected to vary when a sample is ex-

changed. To eliminate unnecessary sources of scattering to the final result, the t

r(T),

Cr(T)  and  CA(T)  data  should  be  smoothed,  e.g.,  by  replacing  the  measured  data  by

continuous functions.

B. The measurement of heat capacities

We have described the principle of measuring differences in the heat capacity using

this DTA technique in detail in an earlier publication2. For a measurement of Cs(T) the

thermal  reservoir  has  to  be  heated  or  cooled  in  such  a  way  that  the  variation 

.

Tb

  is

known as a function of time. We then have to monitor only the temperature Tr of the

reference sample and the temperature difference 

D T , both as functions of time. Like

(cid:160) 

r,  Cr  and  CA,  the 

  and  Tr  data  will  not  show  any  discontinuities  as  a  function  of

.

Tb

(cid:160) 

time  if  the  measuring  set-up  is  reasonably  constructed  and  operated,  and  they  can

(cid:160) 

therefore  be  approximated  by  smooth  continuous  functions.  This  is  not  possible  for

D T ,  however,  because  these  data  may  contain  essential  information  about  possible

abrupt  phase  transitions  of  the  sample.  Assuming  ks  =  kr  and  equal  addenda  heat

capacities  CA  on  the  sample  and  the  reference  side,  the  heat-capacity  difference

D C = Cs

sharp  discontinuities  in  Cs  appear  to  be  broadened  by  this  amount.  This  broadening

However,  the  numerical  evaluation  of

  or

(cid:160) 

introduces a certain broadening d T on the temperature scale that depends on the tem-

(cid:160) 
perature  interval  used  to  calculate  this  derivative.  Moreover,  the  scatter  d

(cid:160) 

D C   in  the

D C   data  as  calculated  from  Eqs.  (3)  or  (6)  is  inevitably  increased  by  such  a  proce-

dure. We have shown that the product d

D C d T is a constant that is determined by Cr

(cid:160) 

(cid:160) 

and by the limiting accuracy with which 

D T  can be measured2. In other words, any

attempt to increase the accuracy of the 

D C  data in T, e.g., by choosing a narrower in-

terval to calculate 

 or 

dD T /dTs, leads to an increased scattering in 

D C .

In the next paragraph we describe how we can completely circumvent this problem of

instrumental broadening if we consider variations in entropy S, rather than variations

in the heat capacity C.

C. The measurement of variations in entropy

a) Measurements with varying temperature

We now consider the difference in the entropy between the sample and the reference

sample, 

D S = Ss

- Sr between two sample temperatures T1 and T2,

(cid:160) 

that becomes

D S(T1) =

If a sharp phase transition occurs, we restrict on a narrow interval [T1,T2 ] around this

(cid:160) 

transition.  We  assume  here  that 

  const.  in  this  interval,  and  that  the  refer-

(cid:160) 

It  can  be  shown  that  if  these  approximations  are  not  strictly  fulfilled,  the  resulting

D S(T2) -

D S(T1)  may  at  most  exhibit  a  slowly  varying  systematic  error.  Partial  inte-

gration of Eq. (8) and using Eq. (9) gives

The Eqs. (10) and (12) have been derived from the exact result (3), and they therefore

do not suffer from any broadening on the temperature scale, i.e., sharp discontinuities

in 

D S  will be correctly reproduced in the measured data.

(cid:160) 

b) Constant temperature and varying magnetic field

In  some  cases  it  is  desirable  to  keep  the  sample  temperature  constant  while  varying

the  external  magnetic  field,  say  from  H1  to  H2,  to  probe  a  possible  magneto-caloric

effect. We will show below that we can use the same DTA set-up to measure again

variations in entropy, 

S(H2) - S(H1) .

At a constant temperature of the thermal reservoir Tb we have Tr = Tb, and 

D T = Ts

- Tb

(cid:160) 

(a reference sample is not needed in such an experiment). The change in entropy of

the sample and the sample platform is given by the amount of heat d Q coming from

(cid:160) 

the thermal reservoir within the time interval dt,

III. First and second-order phase transitions in superconductors

(cid:160) 

In Figs. 2 and 3 we show, as an example, variations in entropy that we have measured

on a single crystal of the high-temperature type-II superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 with a

sample mass m = 3.3 mg. The experimentally determined magnetic phase diagram of

this sample6 is shown in the inset of Fig. 2b. In the mixed state the vortex lattice un-

dergoes  a  fairly  sharp  first-order  phase  transition  from  a  solid  to  a  so-called  vortex-

fluid state at a phase boundary Hm(T). In Fig 2a we present the result of a DTA mea-

surement  around  this  transition  with  a  fixed  magnetic  field  µ0H  =  5  T  and  varying

temperature T. For this experiment, we used PT-100 thermometers with a large exci-

tation current I = 3.5 mA, at a heating rate

data shown in Fig. 2a have been obtained from the 

D T  raw data plotted in the same

figure and using Eq. (12). For clarity, linear backgrounds in

D S  and 

(cid:160) 
D T  that fit the

(cid:160) 
respective  data  right  below  the  phase  transition  have  been  subtracted.  From  such

measurements, the total heat capacity (see Fig. 2b) can be also obtained as discussed

(cid:160) 

(cid:160) 

above and in more detail in Ref. 2.

In Fig. 3 we present the result of corresponding measurements at fixed temperature T

=  83.1  K  and  with  a  varying  magnetic  field  H.  These  experiments  have  been  done

using  a  pair  of  copper-constantan  thermocouples  in  a  differential  configuration,  for

both increasing and decreasing magnetic field with

D T  raw data plotted in Fig. 3a have been treated according to Eq. (19)

D S(H) shown in Fig 3b. Again, linear backgrounds in 

D S  and

(cid:160) 

to obtain the resulting     

(cid:160) 

D T  that fit the respective data right below (measurements with H increasing) or above

the phase transition (H decreasing) have been subtracted for clarity reasons.

(cid:160) 

In  both  types  of  DTA  measurements  we  observe  a  distinct  step  in  entropy

(

D S » 1.4   mJ/moleK2) at the phase-transition line Hm(T), with a Gaussian half-width

of  90  mK  on  the  temperature  scale  and  50  mT  on  the  magnetic-field  scale,  respec-

tively, indicated by the shaded transition regions in Figs. 2a and 3a. It is important to

note  here  that  the  “natural”  instrumental  temperature  and  magnetic-field  scales  that

determine the broadening of the 

D T  raw data are

the  sample  (including  the  sample  platform  and  its  suspension),  and  by  the  response

time of the used thermometers.

Fig. 1: Schematic view of a standard DTA configuration. The sample and a reference

sample  with  the  heat  capacities  Cs  (at  a  temperature  Ts)  and  Cr  (temperature  Tr)  are

connected via the heat links ks and kr with a thermal reservoir (temperature Tb). The

difference 

D T = Ts

- Tr and Tr are monitored during the variation of Tb or the external

magnetic field H as a function of time. With known Cr and addenda heat capacity CA,

(cid:160) 
entropy changes can be calculated using Eqs. (12) or (19) as discussed in the text.

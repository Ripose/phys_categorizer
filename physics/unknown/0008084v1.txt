Abstract

The wire scanners  are  used  for  a  measurement  of  the
very  small  beam  size  and  the  emittance  in  Accelerator
Test  Facility  (ATF).  They are installed in  the  extraction
beam  line  of  ATF  damping  ring.  The  extracted  beam
emittance are e x=1.3x10-9 m.rad, e y=1.7x10-11 m.rad with
2x109  electrons/bunch  intensity  and  1.3GeV  energy[1].
The wire scanners scan the beam by  a tungsten  wire with
beam repetition 0.78Hz. The scanning speed is,  however,
very slow( ~500µm/sec). Since the extracted beam is quite
stable by using  the  double kicker system[2],  precision of
the  size measurement is  less  than  2µm  for  50  -  150µm
horizontal  beam  size  and  0.3µm  for  8  -  16µm  vertical
beam size.  The detail of  the  system  and the  performance
are described.

1  INTRODUCTION

ATF  is  a test  accelerator  to  realize  a  small  emittance
beam which will  be  used  in  an  electron  positron  linear
collider.  The  beam  emittance  measurement  in  the  ATF
extraction line is required for a single bunch and 20 multi-
bunched beam which has  2x1010 electrons in  each  bunch
with  2.8ns  spacing[3].  The  required  resolution  of  the
beam size monitors is less than  1µm  for the  beam of  6  -
7µm vertical size. On the other hand, the  horizontal beam
size is  around 50  -150µm,  bigger than  vertical one.  The
wire scanner beam size monitor  is  the  most  appropriate
monitor  for  the  required  performance.  The  five  wire
scanners together with  a  gamma  detector  at  downstream
are  installed  at  the  region  of  no  dispersion  in 
the
extraction line between qudrupole magnets. The beam size
from 4 or 5 scanners are used to fit an emittance assuming
the optics between the scanners[4].

In order to measure precisely such a small vertical beam
size with  big  horizontal size,  the  installation  of  the  wire
in the beam  line  and precision of  the  movement  are very
important.  The  pulse-to-pulse  stability  of  the  beam  is
also  important  for  such  a  scanning  monitor.  The
performance  of  the  wire  installation  and  movement  are
described together with measurement stability.

supported  by  the  two  arms  in  the  vacuum  chamber.  A
50µm  diameter  gold  plated  tungsten  wire  is  stretched
simultaneously  to    X,  Y  and  U  directions  which  is  45
degree tilted from the X direction. In  the  other side of  the
mount, a 10µm diameter gold plated tungsten wire is also

stretched to X, Y, U and 10degree tilted from X  direction.
The only one wire is directly stretched on the  steel mount
between precise steel pillars in order to have a precision of
the  stretched angle.  Both end of  wire are fixed  to  copper
pillars  with  holding by  solder.  The  moving  direction  of
the wire stage is 45 degree between X and Y axis has an

advantage of that the only one move direction is necessary
for 3  axis  scans.  The  angles  of  the  stretching  wires  are
measured  by  using  a  microscope  with  precision  mover
stage. An example of the measurement is shown in Fig.3.
Each  measured  point  are  fitted  to  a  linear  function  and
relative angles are calculated. The results  are summarized

in Table 1. The error from the design angle is  less  than  1
degree.  The  installation  into  the  beamline  was  done  to
have  10µm  horizontal  wire 
the  precise
horizontal. Using an alignment telescope, tilt angle of  the
whole  wire  scanner  chamber  was  adjusted  within  0.2
degree.

The  two  arm  supports  of  the  wire  mount  inside  the
vacuum  chamber  are  fixed  to  the  two  stages  with  two
bellows  at  both  ends of  support  arm tubes.  The  support
tubes  are  loaded  by  the  vacuum  pressure  loading  from
both side of tubes, however, the pressure cancels it out on
the movement of the  stage.  The load of  mover stage is  a
spring recovery force of  the  bellows  only.  Furthermore a
vibration  of  the  wire  mount  is  reduced  by  using  this
double support stage compared with a single  end support.
As  it  has  many  advantages, the  double stage  mover  was
adopted. The one end of  the  wire mover stage is  powered
by  a  5-phase  stepping  motor  stage  assembly  (Physik
Instrumente  M-510.10).  This  stage  is  driven  by  a  ball
bearing  spindle  of  1mm  pitch  for  one  revolution.  The
stepping  motor  performs  one  rotation  by  2000  steps.
Combining  the  ball  bearing  spindle  and  the  precise
stepping  motor,  the  resolution  of  step  is  0.5µm  and
repeatability is less than  0.1µm.  As  a maximum  starting
pulse rate is  limited to  1  kHz,  a 1024  pulse/sec constant
pulse  rate is  used for the  stage control for  the  reason  of
simplicity.

The  stepping  motor  stage  assembly  has  a  radiation
resistant.  Also,  the  stage  position  sensor  must  have  a
radiation  resistant.  The  Magnescale  position  sensor  is
adopted, because it  does  not  have  processing  electronics
near the sensor. It include a magnetized rod with  very fine
pitch  and  a  pickup  coil.  The  processing  electronics  is
placed outside of the accelerator tunnel.  The resolution  of

the  Magnescale  is  0.5µm  for  100mm  travel,  enough
small for the beam size measurement of 10µm.

The vibration measurements[5] were done for the  same
type  of  the  stage using  a  laser  light  beam  on  the  wire.
The  cw  laser  beam  of  70µm  diameter  was  used  to
simulate  stable  particle  beam.  The  vibration  of  wire
appears on the absorption  change of  the  photo-detector at
downstream of the  laser beam.  The observed vibration  of
wire( 50µm  diameter )  was  always  less  than  0.3µmp.p.
for 55 Hz to 771 Hz clock speed. With higher clock speed
for  the  stepping  motor  more  than  150  Hz  reduce  the
vibration  amplitude  to  0.2µmp.p..  It  is  enough  small
amplitude for ATF beam measurement.

3  WIRE SIGNAL DETECTION

A breamsstrahlung gamma-ray is used for the  signal  of
beam  and  wire  interaction.  A  gamma-ray  detector[6]  is
placed  at  the  last  bending  magnet  in  the  end  of  beam
diagnostic  section.  The  detector  is  a  cerencov  detector
which  consists  of  2mm  thick  lead  plate  converter,  air
light guide and a photo-multiplier tube(PMT).  In  order to
shield the PMT  from other noise  source such  as  gamma-
ray and neutrons caused by  beam loss  in  other place, the
PMT  is  placed at  the  floor with  lead  shield  and  the  1m
long  light  guide  is  used  between  the  cerenkov  light
radiator and the PMT. Since the  gamma detection is  done
by  a calorimetric way,  low  HV voltage is  applied to  the
PMT with light intensity filter in  front of  the  PMT.  The
intensity  filter  is  made  by  thin  plate  with  many  small
holes which reduce the light intensity. The HV voltage is
changed from 600V to  950V  depending on  the  beam size
and the wire diameter. The wire signal out  from the  PMT
is  a pulse  signal  with  around  20ns  width  detected  by  a
charge sensitive  ADC  using  100ns  gate.  Since  the  ADC
is  installed at  the  outside  of  the  tunnel,  a  20m  coaxial
cable is used between the PMT and the ADC.

4   BEAM SIZE MEASUREMENT

The acquisition of the wire signal  is  done by  the  BPM
reader task  which read the  all  BPM  signal  and  the  beam

intensity  monitor  synchronously  with  one  ATF  beam
cycle.  As  a  consequence,  the  wire  signal,  the  beam
intensities  and  the  beam  positions  are  stored  into  the
database for the same beam pass. A fluctuation of the wire
signal  caused  by  the  beam  intensity  is  corrected  by
normalizing  the  wire  signal  by  the  extraction  beam
intensity.  As  an example, a fluctuation of  wire signal  is
shown  in  Fig.4  together  with  its  averaged  signal.  The
spread  of  the  distribution  which  is  not  so  much  gives
0.3µm  error  in 
the  fitted  beam  size.  A  position
fluctuation  is  not  corrected,  because  of 
insufficient
resolution of  BPM  compared with  beam fluctuation.  The
resolution  of  BPM  is  around  10  to  20µm,  while  the
position  jitter  of  beam is  estimated to  2.4  to  4.4µm  by
using the wire  sitting  in  beam and using  high  resolution
microwave BPMs  which are newly installed in  the  same
region.

In case of X, Y and 10 degree wires, stage positions  are
recorded as an abscissa which must  be converted to  a real
movement in its directions,  such  as  multiplying  1/sqrt(2)
for X and Y. The size also  must  be corrected by  the  wire
diameter. The effect is quadratic of (d/4) where d is  a wire
diameter. The simulation  shows  that  the  corrected  beam
size is enough accurate down to 2µm beam size.

The scanning speed is around 30sec for one profile. The
slow  scan  is  coming  from  both  the  0.78Hz  beam
repetition and the slow stage movement. The scan is made
as  follows;  by  setting  the  wire  stage  to  the  initial
position at first, then wait the beam passing,  get  the  wire
signal  together with  the  beam  intensity,  go  to  the  next
stage position,  then  repeat  again  until  the  end  position
coming. This means that the shortest scanning time is the
beam repetition times number of the scanning points.

5  EMITTANCE MEASUREMENT

emittance 

calculation 

assuming 

Beam size measurements at  more  than  three  locations
in  different optical  condition are necessary for  measuring
an  emittance.  The  optics  of  the  wire  scanner  region  is
determined by  the  SAD  simulation  to  have  less  error  in
the 
reasonable
measurement error[7].  In case of  ATF  flat  beam,  vertical
beam size measurement is affected by a small beam tilt  or
a  small  wire  tilt.  The  beam  tilt  happens  by  an  x-y
coupling  and  a  residual  x,  y  dispersion.  Four  skew
quadrupole  magnets  are  introduced  into  the  upstream  of
the  wire scanner  region  to  compensate  beam  tilt.  Also,
the  careful  tuning  of  dispersion  suppression  less  than
10mm 
emittance
measurement.  A  10mm  dispersion  causes  about  6µm
beam size increment which is  comparable to  the  vertical
size.  The  dispersion  is  measured  by  wire  scanner  with
1mm resolution using peak shift of the scanned profile by
changing the  ring  frequency.  The  measured  Y  emittance
by  changing 
intensity  using  one  skew
quadrupole are  shown  in  Fig.5.  The  observed  emittance
growth with  beam intensity  is  larger than  the  growth  of

is  stable  within  4.4µm, 

The five wire scanners in  the  ATF  extraction  line  are
used  to  measure  the  beam  size  of  50  -  150µm  in
horizontal and 8  -  16µm  in  vertical.  Since  the  extracted
beam 
the  wire  scanner
measurement is  performed by  less  than  2µm  stability  in
X  and 0.3µm  in  Y.  The measured emittance are near the
ATF target in case of  low  beam intensity.  The emittance
growth with beam intensity is still not understandable.

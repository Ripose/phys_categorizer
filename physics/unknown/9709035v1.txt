low free carrier concentrations . This type of material is attractive as a medium for X-ray detection,

Abstract
Thick  epitaxial layers have been grown using Low Pressure Vapour Phase Epitaxy techniques
with  low free carrier concentrations . This type of material is attractive as a medium for
X-ray detection because of its high conversion efficiency for X-rays in the medically interesting
energy range.

The wafer was processed to produce detector diodes of 3
mm diameter with 500 m m wide guard rings separated by a
gap  of  10  m m.  The  epi-layer  contact  was  made  with  a
Ti/Pd/Au Schottky contact.

The  substrate  contact  used  a  Pd/Ge  metallisation.  A
nitride  encapsulation  was  deposited  on  both  sides  and
apertures  opened  in  the  nitride  layer  to  facilitate  wire
bonding.

Very  high  growth  rates  have  been  achieved  in  vapour
phase  epitaxial  growth  systems  by  reducing  the  reactor
pressure. The growth rate of some tens of microns per hour
steadily decreases as the pressure is reduced and then begins
to  increase  as  the  pressure  is  reduced  still  further.  Growth
rates  of  over  100  m m/hour  have  been  achieved  using  this
low pressure technique[1]. Thick epitaxial layers with a low
enough  free  carrier  concentration  would  be  ideal  as
radiation detectors with particular advantages in the area of
X-ray detection. Existing silicon based detectors have a low
detection  efficiency  in  comparison  with    GaAs  as  the
photoelectric  conversion  probability  scales  with  the  fifth
power of the atomic number of the detection medium. Even
so,  Si  CCD's  with  a  scintillating  layer  manage  to  compete
with  the  most  efficient  film  and  screen  systems  in  use  to-
day. Typically these still use only about 2% of the available
radiation due to their low photon conversion efficiency.

As a first step in evaluating the potential of low pressure
VPE growth for detectors, a test run to grow thick layers of
high  purity  epitaxial  GaAs  was  performed  in  a  specially
modified reactor at Epitronics  Corp.  3  sample  wafers  were
sent  to  Glasgow  for  material  characterisation  and  detector
evaluation.  Local  variations  were  enough  to  make  the
surface appear dull before polishing.

The layers were grown on 3 heavily doped 450 m m thick
wafers 
supplied  by  Hitachi  Cable.  As  detector
characterisation  with  epitaxial  layers  grown  on  semi-
insulating  substrates  is  very  difficult,  the  wafers  were  Si
doped to 1018 cm-3. The surface morphology of the grown
layer showed rather large variations in wafer thickness with
a strong gradient across it along one axis.

The  thickness  gradient  is  thought  to  be  due  to  the  gas
flow across the wafer surface during growth and should be
eliminated  by  appropriate  modification  of  the  glassware  in
the reactor. Because of the large gradient in layer thickness
it was decided not to lap the epi-layer mechanically prior to
processing which is part of our normal detector fabrication
process. The wafer was chemically polished instead  with  a
H2O2:NH4 solution with pH maintained at 7.9 +/- 0.1 until
roughly 30 m m of the layer was removed. It was hoped that
this  would  give  us  optimum  surface  properties  while
removing  a  minimum  of  material  from  the  layer.  After
polishing  the  small  localised  surface  variations  were  no
longer  evident  but  the  larger  surface  gradients  were  still
present.

EPI-LAYER

SUBSTRATE

Fig[1] Measured wafer thickness in microns showing the gradient
across the epi-layer. The unpolished surface had a dull appearance.

The  diode  characteristic  shown  in  Fig[2]  shows  the
leakage  current  of  a  typical  detector  from  this  batch.  The
thickness  gradient  across  the  wafer  did  not  permit  a  good
mask  contact  and  all  the  guard  rings  on  the  detector
structures were shorted to the detectors. The leakage current
density is much more than 20 nA mm-2 which  is  what  we
would  expect  for  semi-insulating  material[2]  and  much

higher than expected for good diodes on epi material. This
is due to a lack of adequate guarding of the structure which
leads  to  leakage  from  the  whole  layer  being  measured
instead of that due to the detector structure.

The  growth  of  the  active  thickness  of  the  detector  in
LEC material is known to be a linear function of bias. The
behaviour  of  depletion  depth  in  the  epi  material  shows  the
usual dependence on the square root of the bias. The plot of
1/C2  vs.  bias  shown  in  Fig[4]  does  not  flatten  off  at  any
point  indicating  that  the  layer  does  not  fully  deplete  at  the
highest bias that could be applied before breakdown.

Bias Voltage (V)

The capacitance  of  the  detectors  was  measured  at  three
frequencies  to  determine  the  free  carrier  concentration  and
also  the  depletion  depth  which  corresponds  to  the  active
layer thickness of the detector. No variations in capacitance
with  frequency  at  low  bias  were  observed.  This  is  not  the
case with semi-insulating LEC material[3] and indicates that
the trap concentration  in  this  high  growth  rate  epi-material
is much lower than in LEC. DLTS measurements performed
on this epi material indicate a concentration of 7x1014 cm-3
for the deep level EL2.

Fig[4] Full depletion is never reached due to the high free carrier
concentration.

The measured capacitance was 73 pF at 100 V bias  and
42 pF for 200 V bias for the 3 mm pads. These give 20 m m
and  27.5  m m  respectively  for  the  depletion  layer  thickness
and  show  the  epi-layer  to  have  an  effective  free  carrier
concentration of around 3x1014 cm-3 for the diodes that we
measured.

the  active 

The  diodes  were  also  tested    as  detectors  to  determine
their charge collection efficiency. This is not 100% for LEC
detectors  but  increases  linearly  with  applied  bias.  The
charge  collection  efficiency  of 
layer  was
measured to be 100% for a variety of X-ray energies and the
count  rate  for  a  given  experimental  set-up  varied  with  the
square  root  of  the  applied  voltage.  Fig[5]  shows  the
measured  spectrum  from  a  44  keV  Terbium  source.  While
the  excess  current  in  the  present  detectors  limited  the
energies  that  could  be  resolved  from  noise  to  those  above
Ba (36 keV), it should not be a problem to resolve X-rays of
much lower energies  with well-fabricated detectors.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The grown layers are well suited to making high quality
X-ray radiation detectors. The ability to grow thick layers of
sufficiently high quality in reactors with capacities for many
tens  of  wafers  per  run  would  make  this  the  material  of
choice for most X-ray detection/imaging applications of the
future.  The  biggest  challenge  to  be  overcome  for  this
material is the reduction in free carrier concentration of the
grown material as this determines the thickness of the active

layer  for  any  applied  bias  --  thick  layers  are  only  useful  if
they are fully depleted.

The  difficulties  in  processing  due 

the  surface
properties  of  the  wafers  do  not  pose  a  serious  problem.
Mechanical polishing of the surface will remove most of the
irregularities if the layer is grown sufficiently thick initially
to produce a flat surface.

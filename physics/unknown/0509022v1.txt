Abstract

We analyzed the correlations among the parameters of the Reasenberg and Jones (1989) formula

describing the aftershock rate after a mainshock as a function of time and magnitude, on the basis of

parameter estimates made in previous works for New Zealand, Italy and California. For all of three

datasets we found that the magnitude-independent productivity a is significantly correlated with the

b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter law and, in some cases, with parameters p and c of the modified

Omori’s law.  In most cases, we also found a significant correlation between p and c but, different

from other previous works, we did not find a significant correlation between p and b.  We argued

that the correlation between a and b can be ascribed to an inappropriate definition of the coefficient

of  mainshock  magnitude  as  the  correlation  becomes  insignificant  if  the  latter  is  assumed  to  be

α≈2/3b rather than b.  This interpretation well agrees with the results of direct α estimates we made,

by an epidemic type model (ETAS), from the data of some large Italian sequences. We also verified

that assuming α about 2/3 of the average b value estimated from Italian sequences occurred in the

time interval 1981-1996 improves the ability to predict the behavior of most recent sequences (from

1997 to 2003). The discrepancy with other recent analysis of distributed seismicity, which found

α≈b, might be due to a lower fractal dimension of the spatial distribution of shocks belonging to

single  sequences  with  respect  to  the  entire  seismicity  of  an  area.  Our  results  indicate  a  partial

inadequacy  of  the  original  Reasenberg  and  Jones  (1989)  formulation  when  used  to  forecast  the

productivity  of  future  sequences.  In  particular,  the  aftershock  rates  and  probabilities  tend  to  be

overestimated for stronger mainshocks and conversely underestimated for weaker ones. We also

inferred that the correlation of a with p and c might be the consequence of the trade-off between the

two  parameters  of  the  modified  Omori’s  law.  In  this  case  the  correlation  can  be  removed  by

renormalizing  the  time-dependent  part  of  the  rate  equation.  Finally,  the  absence  of  correlation

between p and b, observed for all the examined datasets, indicates that such correlation, previously

suggested by theoretical inferences and empirical results from some regions, does not represent a

common property of aftershock sequences in different part of the world.

1.  Introduction

Standard Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment (PSHA) methods (e. g. Cornel, 1968) usually

completely  neglect  aftershock  occurrence.  However,  the  experience  of  recent  significant

earthquakes  clearly  showed  that  strong  aftershocks  are  the  source  of  further  damages  and  of  an

expansion  of  the  area  requiring  emergency  services  (Hough  and  Jones,  1997).  Thus  a  reliable

forecasting  of  the  behavior  of  the  aftershock  sequences,  starting  from  the  first  hours  since  the

mainshock, is highly desirable and often is also strongly solicited by civil services, rescue corps and

mass-media.

Most current approaches to aftershock-rate modeling refer to scaling laws that were empirically

found to fit well the data in different parts of the world, such as the frequency-magnitude Gutenberg

and Richter (1944) law (G-R) and the Modified Omori Model (MOM, Utsu, 1971) describing shock

rate  decay  with  time.   Reasenberg  and  Jones  (1989)  proposed  a  simple  comprehensive  model,

which is still in use, at the U.S Geological Survey, to forecast aftershock rates and probabilities in

Southern California and in few other areas of the world. They combined the G-R and the MOM to

describe the aftershock occurrence as a non-stationary Poisson process whose rate varies with time t

after the mainshock according to

λ t( ) =

)

(
10a +b M m −M min
t + c

) p

(

(1)

where b is the slope of the G-R, c is a small time shift (usually <1 day) that controls the sequence

behavior in the first times after the mainshock, p (usually around 1)  determines the speed of decay

of aftershock rate with time, and a is referred by the authors as the “productivity” of the sequence.

(cid:0) 

Mm is the mainshock magnitude and Mmin is the lower magnitude threshold of the sequence.

Several other studies, dedicated to the understanding of the aftershock sequence behavior, have

been  published  in  the  last  decades.  Among  those  others,  Kagan  and  Knopoff  (1981,  1987)  and

Ogata  (1988)  introduced  the  epidemic  principle  (ETAS),  considering  the  aftershock  generation

process as the superposition of simple Omori’s decays. The ETAS model has also been used to give

short-term probabilistic forecast of seismic activity (Kagan and Knopoff, 1987; Kagan and Jackson,

2000;  Console  and  Murru,  2001).  Gross  and  Kisslinger  (1994)  demonstrated  that  the  stretched

exponential  law  (Shlesinger  and Montroll,  1984;  Kisslinger,  1993)  may  fit  the  data  better  than

MOM in some cases. Recently, Helmstetter and Sornette (2002) showed that aftershock sequences

may follow different regimes (subcritical and supercritical) depending on the “branching ratio”, that

is the mean aftershock number triggered per event, while Narteau et al (2002, 2003) proposed a

3

“band limited” power law restricted to the time interval between two characteristic times, before

and after which the rate decay with time is respectively linear and exponential.

These  contributions  strongly  deepen  our  understanding  on  various  aspects  of  the  aftershock

physics and particularly of their distribution in time, space and magnitude. Also, such models are

able to improve the fit with the data of complex sequences in most cases. However, in our present

analysis, we concentrate on the Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model because it is very simple and

particularly  suited  to  make  forecast  of  the  behavior  of  future  sequences.  Basically,  it  allows  to

compute,  representative  average  values  of  model  parameters  from  the  sequences  previously

occurred in a certain area. Moreover, although Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model is less accurate

and  refined  than  the  other  ones  mentioned  above,  it  has  the  merit  to  allow  the  forecasting  of

aftershock behavior only basing on the mainshock magnitude while the other models also require

the  real-time  location  and  sizing  of  all  the  aftershocks  above  a  given  threshold.  Finally,  the

Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model was applied in different parts of the world with rather uniform

procedures  since  these  were  established  in  specific  Fortran  codes  written  by  Paul  Reasenberg

(cluster5  for  sequence  detection  and  aspar3x  for  sequence  modeling).  This  allows  making

inferences whose validity is not restricted to the specific dataset or region considered. Furthermore,

since we analyze the results of previously published papers, we avoid the risk of biasing the results

by the adoption of ad hoc choices for sequence detection and modeling.

2.  Estimation and meaning of Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model parameters

Program aspar3x computes the parameters of the Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model through

the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) technique, from the data of real sequences. While the b-

value  of  the  G-R  law  is  determined  by  fitting  the  distribution  of  aftershock  magnitudes

independently of time, using the procedure firstly developed by Aki (1965), the other parameters

are  estimated  maximizing,  with  respect  to  the  values  of  parameters  p and c,  the  likelihood  (i.e.

Ogata, 1983) of the MOM equation

where K is computed by constraining the rate integral from S (initial time) to T (end time) to be

equal to the total number N of observed shocks with M≥Mmin

In expressions (1) and (4), bMmin accounts for the dependence of the number of shocks on the

minimum-magnitude threshold, according to the G-R law. The term a+bMm corresponds to the G-R

intercept of the considered dataset and can be seen as the global aftershock productivity of the given

(cid:0) 

sequence.  In such term, a represents the magnitude independent productivity, maybe related to the

local physical properties of the area where the sequence occurs, while bMm is the productivity factor

related to mainshock magnitude.

Differently  from  p  and c,  that  only  depend  on  the  time  distribution  of  shocks,  and  b,  only

depending on shock magnitudes, parameter a is a function of both time and magnitude distributions.

We can consider it as the sum of two factors: a “true” magnitude independent productivity and a

time-dependence  normalizing  factor.  In  principle,  the  separation  of  the  two  factors  could  be

possible when p>1 as, in this case, the total number of shocks generated by the mainshock, in the

time interval t=[0,∞], is finite and can be computed as

Such  equation  also  makes  clearer  the  dimensional  consistency  of  the  formulation  as  the

numerator is a pure number and the denominator a time. However such separation is not possible in

general, as if p≤1, for any Mmin, both Ntot and a0 tend to ∞ (albeit a is finite).

(cid:0) 

Actually, the divergence of Ntot is likely a mathematical paradox rather than a physical reality

because physical arguments and empirical evidences suggest that the total number of aftershocks of

a real sequence must be finite. In fact, Narteau et al. (2002) have recently shown that a physically

grounded model, with a power law decay limited in time, fits the data better then the simple MOM.
5

They  showed  that,  for  times  longer  than  a  critical  value  t2  (some  tens  or  hundreds  of  days,

depending on the p value), real sequences exhibit a faster exponential decay. This implies that, even

if the rate for t<t2 is well described by a MOM with p≤1, the total number of aftershocks generated

by a mainshock could be finite. For the sake of an approximate estimation of the true productivity

of the sequences, we could limit the computation of the normalization integral of eq. (7) and (8) to a

finite time window, definitely larger than t2 (usually few years), after which the sequence rate and

even the remainder of the integral are assumed to be negligible.

It has been noted already (Helmstetter, 2003) that taking b as the linear coefficient of Mm is only

an hypothesis, also assumed by many other studies (Kagan and Knopoff, 1987; Davis and Frolich,

1991; Console and Murru, 2001; Felzer et al., 2002), that lacks of a clear justification. It can be

heuristically deduced from the assumption that the mainshock and the aftershocks belong to the

same population and follow the same G-R law. Although this might appear reasonable, there are not

strict  physical  arguments  or  univocal  empirical  evidences  proving  that  the  productivity  of  a

mainshock scales with magnitude with a coefficient equal to b.  Helmstetter et al (in press) suggest

that such coefficient is strictly related to the fractal dimension D of hypocenters distribution. From

physical  considerations  on  the  nature  of  the  triggering  stress  they  inferred  a  relation 

α ≈ 0.5D

which, on the basis of the estimate D≈2, made for a network of faults in California, brings to α≈1

and thus α≈b.

(cid:0) 

Ogata (1988) and subsequent papers made a different assumption with respect to Reasenberg and

Jones (1989): they still took a common coefficient α for both Mm  and Mmin but considered it as a

different parameter to be estimated from data independently of b.  Recently, Console et al. (2003),

applying an ETAS model on the entire Italian seismicity, found a value of mainshock productivity

coefficient about 0.5b. Furthermore, Helmstetter (2003), by a stacking of the catalogue of Southern

California earthquakes, computed a value around 0.8, significantly lower than the average b-value

although the subsequent paper (Helmstetter et al., in press), making some different choices in the

clustering algorithm, came to the conclusion that mainshock productivity coefficient is 1.05±0.05

which also agrees with the independent result obtained by Feltzer et al. (2004). It is to be noted

however  that  the  latter  approaches  capture  the  features  of  a  process  –  the  entire  seismicity  of  a

extended  area  over  a  time  interval  of  some  tens  of  years  –  essentially  different  from  the  one

considered in this paper: the occurrence of aftershocks in the months after the main shocks and

along  well  defined  faults.  As  well,  they  are  all  almost  unusable  for  forecasting  as  they  would

require the detection and sizing, in near real-time, of all of the shocks (above a certain magnitude

threshold)  occurring  in  the  considered  area,  which  can  hardly  be  performed  by  seismological

observatories during a very productive seismic sequence.

6

An empirical approach to settle the question regarding the correct value of mainshock magnitude

coefficient derives from the following consideration: if the magnitude productivity term bMm of the

Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model well describes the dependence of the number of aftershocks on

mainshock  magnitude  we  would  have  to  expect  that  it  is  not  correlated  with  the  magnitude-

independent productivity a.  If instead such a interplay of the two term is effective then it can be the

symptom  of  an  inadequate  formulation  of  the  two  terms.  This  argument  addresses  in  a  simple

empirical  way  a  more  general  problem  concerning  the  search  for  an  orthogonal  set  of  model

parameters  (Cox  and  Reid,  1987).  If  we  exactly  know  the  form  of  a  model  with  a  given  set  of

parameters  and  these  are  not  orthogonal  it  is  possible  to  deduce  an  orthogonal  set  that  is  more

efficient  in  estimating  the  parameters  from  the  data  by  MLE  (i.e. Yang  and  Xie,  2003).  When

instead  the  physical  grounding,  like  in  this  case,  is  weak  or  lacking  we  cannot  establish  if  the

parameters  actually  represent  independent  effects  rather  than  combinations  of  factors  and  the

analysis of correlation among the parameters can be used to find an optimal parameter set.

We  want  to  point  out  that  the  choice  of  model  parameters  representing  truly  independent

physical properties of the aftershock occurrence process is crucial when their estimates are averaged

to compute a-priori values to be used for the forecasting of future sequences as done for example

by Reasenberg and Jones (1989), Eberhart-Phillips (1998) and Lolli and Gasperini (2003). The use

of hybrid variables, depending on the combination of different factors, reduces the accuracy of the

estimates and at the same time the reliability of the forecasting model. For example parameter K of

the  simple  modified  Omori  law  is  completely  unusable  for  the  forecasting  as  it  depends  on  the

lower magnitude threshold and on the mainshock magnitude. Thus estimates of K from different

sequences are not comparable among each other and the average of K values is not significant for

the forecasting. In this sense, parameter a of the Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model is instead, at

least  partially,  “debiased”  from  these  effects  and  can  be  tentatively  averaged  to  predict  the

productivity of future sequences.

3.  Testing the correlation among aftershock model parameters

The correlation among the parameters of the scaling law describing the aftershock behavior as a

function  of  time,  space  and  magnitude  has  been  investigated  in  many  theoretical  papers  (Utsu,

1961; Mikumo and Miyagate, 1979; Main, 1992). Guo and Ogata (1995, 1997) studied parameter

empirical correlation basing on the data of interplate and intraplate Japanese sequences. They found

a clear correlation between some couples of parameters but in some cases with opposite sign for

intraplate and interplate earthquakes. For example the correlation between p and b is positive for

7

intraplate earthquakes and negative for interplate ones. They suggested that these differences might

reflect some intrinsically different features in the rupturing process between earthquakes within a

plate and on a margin between two plates.

In our present analysis we mainly consider the estimates of the  Reasenberg and Jones (1989)

model parameters made by Lolli and Gasperini (2003) for Italy and by Eberhart-Phillips (1998) for

New Zealand as these works list the parameter values for the different sequences (Datasets 1 and 2

respectively in Appendix A). Unfortunately this is not the case of the original work for California

by Reasenberg and Jones (1989). However, we have received a list of sequence parameters (Dataset

3)  from  one  of  the  authors  (Jones,  personal  communication)  that  allows  us  to  make  some

computations even on such data.

The aspar3x program was used by Lolli and Gasperini (2003) and   Eberhart-Phillips (1998) to

homogeneously  estimate  the  parameters  of  the  rate  formula.  Moreover,  the  Reasenberg (1985)

clustering  program  (cluster5)  was  used,  by  both  works,  to  associate  events  into  aftershock

sequences. Lolli and Gasperini (2003) also employed a simpler clustering algorithm, similar to the

one  proposed  by  Gardner  and  Knopoff  (1974),  based  on  a  space-time  window  varying  with

mainshock magnitude. A comparison made by Lolli and Gasperini (2003) among corresponding

sequences detected by different methods showed that the influence of the clustering algorithm on

estimated parameters is almost negligible. The procedure followed by Reasenberg and Jones (1989)

was instead slightly different as they fixed c=0.05 for all the sequences. This prevents correlation

analyses involving such parameter for California dataset.

We evaluated the existence of linear correlation among couples of variables by computing the

linear correlation coefficient r and estimating its statistical significance (Davis, 1986, pp. 67). We

compared  the  H0  hypothesis  that  the  linear  correlation  coefficient  r is  equal  to  0  versus  the

alternative that it is different from 0 using the Student-t statistics

t =

)

r2 n − 2
(
1− r 2

(12)

If  the  value  of  t  is  greater  than  the  critical  threshold  (found  in  common  statistical  tables)

corresponding  to  the  significance  level  s.l.=0.05  for  the  given  degrees  of  freedom  n-2,  the  H0

hypothesis  can  be  confidently  rejected  and  thus  the  existence  of  correlation  can  be  asserted.

Conversely,  if  t is smaller than the threshold the  correlation  can  be  excluded.  The  s.l. shown in

following tables indicate the probability that a larger t may occur by chance if r=0.

3.1 Correlation between a and b

8

A  significant negative correlation between parameters a and b is evidenced in Table 1 for the

joint dataset including the sequences from Italy, New Zealand and California as well as for the three

regions separately (Fig 1). Similar correlations can also be found between a and bMm (Fig. 2). The

estimated values of the regression coefficient are quite similar for the different datasets (–0.34±0.14

for  New  Zealand,  –0.37±0.13  for  Italy  and  –0.35±0.06  for  California)  as  well  as  the  regression

intercepts that are close to 0 for Italy and California and about 0.33 for New Zealand. The joint

dataset  including  data  from  all  of  the  three  regions  gives  a  slightly  different  coefficient

(–0.30±0.05) and an intercept of 0.22±0.25. On the contrary, the absence of correlation between a

and bMmin (Table 1) in most cases confirms that the latter term quite well accounts for the cutting of

earthquakes below Mmin, according to the G-R law.

As  argued  above,  the  observed  correlation  between  a and bMm  might  be  the  symptom  of  the

inappropriateness of assuming the coefficient of mainshock magnitude equal to b.   Our analysis

seems to give a preference to an average mainshock magnitude coefficient of about 2/3b. We can

rewrite equation (1) as

where we can assume

λ t( ) =

10a1 +αMm −bM min
t + c

) p

(

(cid:0) 

α = 0.65b
a1 = a + 0.35bM m

(13)

(14)

Table 1 gives the confirmation that now a1 is uncorrelated to αMm for all the three datasets. As

well,  in  all  cases,  excluding  the  joint  set  with  the  data  of  the  three  regions  together,  a1  is  not

(cid:0) 

correlated even to b (Fig. 3). Note that the peculiarity of the California dataset, showing a clear

negative significant correlation between a and bMmin, is very likely an artifacts of the combination

of  the  correlation  found  between  a and bMm  and  of  the  choice  of  taking  Mmin=Mm–3  for  all  the

sequences, made by Reasenberg and Jones (1989).

Eq.  (13)  is  not  directly  usable  to  model  single  sequences  as  parameters  a1  and α  cannot  be

estimated  simultaneously.  However,  we  can  assume  α≅0.65b  as  an  average  property  of  all

sequences in different regions of the world and estimate a different value of a1 for each sequence.

We must underline that eq. (13), when used to forecast the behavior of future sequences, implies a

definitely different aftershock-rate dependence on mainshock magnitude (often  the  only  reliable

information available on the current sequence in the hours immediately after a mainshock) with

respect to the original formulation. In particular it predicts lower rates than Reasenberg and Jones

(1989)  for stronger mainshocks and higher rates for weaker ones. It might be argued that this could

be  due  to  a  bias  in  the  selection  of  the  sequences.  Particularly,  the  sequences  related  with  low

9

magnitude mainshocks could be included in the datasets only if they had an unusually large number

of aftershocks and thus a particularly high productivity. However this can be excluded, at a first

order at least, since a significant linear correlation between a and bMm can even be found (although

with a slightly lower coefficient) for the dataset limited to the sequences with mainshock magnitude

equal or larger than 6.0 (Table 1) for which the sequence catalogue is likely to be complete.

Another possible objection to the interpretation of the observed correlation between a and bMm

given in terms of the inadequacy of the formulation, could come from the role played by parameter

estimation errors. As a is computed as a function of b, the correlation can be artificially induced, at

least in part, by random errors on b. This effect is not easy to evaluate, however if it is significant

we should have to observe a similar correlation also between a and bMmin and we should have to

correct even the coefficient of Mmin to remove the correlation.  As such correlation is not effective

for both Italy and New Zealand (and it is due to aftershock selection rules for California) we can

deduce  that  estimation  errors  are  not  likely  to  be  the  main  source  of  the  observed  correlation

between a and bMm.

The regional averages of parameter a1, reported in Table 2 (0.02±0.06 for California, –0.12±0.13

for Italy and 0.38±0.16 for New Zealand), approximately corresponds to the intercept terms of the

regressions  between  a  and  b Mm  for  the  same  areas.  We  can  hypothesize  that  the  significant

difference  between  New  Zealand  and  other  two  regions  reflects  the  local  characteristics  of  the

seismogenic area but, at the same time, that it can be artificially induced by the different calibration

of the magnitude scales. We must note, in fact, that the magnitude scale adopted for New Zealand is

Mw  (Eberhart-Phillips,  1998),  while  Ml  (calibrated  with  real  and  synthetic  Wood-Anderson

instruments) was used for Italy (Gasperini, 2002; Lolli and Gasperini, 2003) and for most sequences

of California (Reasenberg and Jones, 1989). We made an attempt to make the magnitude of the

New Zealand catalogue homogeneous with the other two, using the empirical relation found for the

Italian catalogue by Gasperini and Ferrari (2000)

(
Log10 M 0

) = 1.22 ±0.08
(

)M l + 17.70 ±0.40

(

)
)       R2 = 0.87

(

(15)

This formula lies about in the middle of the distribution of empirical laws estimated in various

areas (Thacher and Hanks, 1973; Backun, 1984; Johnston, 1996; Backun and Lindt, 1977; Bolt and

Herraiz, 1983; Chavez and Priestley, 1985) and represents a reasonable compromise among them.

(cid:0) 

We did not use the specific relation available for New Zealand by Dowrick and Rhoades (1998) as

this  is  poorly  constrained  by  the  data  (R 2=0.65),  probably  because  it  is  based  on  Ml  estimates

mostly made not using true or synthetic Wood-Anderson instruments.

When Mm, Mmin and b values for New Zealand dataset are converted from Mw to Ml by inversely

using equation (15), the average value of a1 becomes -0.03±0.16 (Table 2) as well as the a1 vs bMm

10

regression, for both the joint datasets (Italy plus New Zealand and all the three regions together),

gives coefficients of about –0.35 and intercepts close to 0 (Table 1), very similar to the values found

for separate regions. Although the zero-close averages of parameter a1 for the all regions may only

be  due  to  the  chance,  we  must  note  that  our  analysis  indicates  a  surprising  homogeneity  of  the

average behavior of seismic sequences in different parts of the world.

Owing  to  the  high  dispersion  of  the  data,  it  can  be  argued  that  regression  coefficients  and

correlation significances might be biased by outliers and by a deviation from normality of residuals

distribution. For testing this possibility we applied a bootstrap resampling technique (Efron and

Tbishirani, 1986; Hall, 1992) to the a vs bMm regression. We extracted 5000 random samples (with

repetition) from the different datasets and computed means and medians of regression parameters

and statistics. Table 2 shows the results of bootstrap test for single regions and for joint datasets. In

all cases both the means and medians give values very close to those estimated by standard least-

squares  regression  thus  allowing  to  exclude  the  existence  of  a  bias  induced  by  outliers  or  by

deviations from normality.

Another effect of the parameter transformation from a to a1, shown in Table 3, is the reduction of

the standard deviation (of 15% on average) both for the separate regional set and for the joint one.

This seems to indicate that the new parameter definition better corresponds to a common property

(the true magnitude-independent productivity) of the sequences.

3.2 Correlation between a and MOM parameters

Table 4 shows that parameters a and a1 are significantly and positively correlated with p for both

the joint datasets including sequences from Italy and New Zealand (Fig 4) and from all the three

regions  together.  A  similar  correlation  can  also  be  found,  for  the  former  dataset,  between

parameters a and c (Fig.5). We also report in Table 4 the results of correlation analyses (which are

also significant) with respect to Log c (Fig.6) because the latter describes the parameter distribution

better than c itself (Lolli and Gasperini, 2003). Weaker correlations can be found when considering

Italy  and  New  Zealand  datasets  independently.  On  the  contrary,  for  California,  the  correlation

between  a and p  is totally insignificant, and between a and both c and Log c is not meaningful

because  c=0.05 is assumed for all the sequences of this dataset.

Although relatively weak, the correlations found can be tentatively ascribed to the effect of the

implicit inclusion in parameters a and a1 of the time-dependence normalization integral. In fact, if

we remove the term

Int = −Log10

T∫[

0

(

t + c

)− p dt

]

11

(16)

(cid:0) 

from both  a and a1  (in Table 4, parameters a0=a–Int and a2=a1–Int), assuming for all sequences

T=1096 days (3 years) as upper limit after which the remainder of the time integral is considered to

be negligible (see above), the correlation becomes not significant in all but one case with respect

either to p, c and Log c. The average value of a2 is about 1.0 for all the separate dataset as well as

for  the  joint  one  (Table  3).  Moreover  even  for  this  reformulation  the  standard  deviations  of

transformed parameters are lower for Italy and New Zealand and to a smaller extent for the joint

dataset (Table 2). Conversely the variances slightly increase for California where, as noted above,

the procedure followed to estimate Omori’s law parameters was significantly different.

With this modification the rate formula would become

(17)

Due to the approximate procedure we have used to estimate the normalization integral and the

weakness of the correlation found, equation (17) is far from being significant and reliable enough to

(cid:0) 

be proposed as a possible rate formula for the actual modeling and forecasting of simple sequences.

However the fact that a2 is now independent of the other parameters (b, p, and c in Tables 1 and 4)

suggests that its regionally or locally averaged values could be more suitable than those computed

from a1 (or a) to predict the behavior of future sequences occurring in the same areas.

3.3 Correlation among other parameters

In  Table  5  we  report  the  results  of  correlation  analyses  among  b, p and c.  We  find  a  weak

negative correlation (r=–0.22) between b and  p, only for the joint dataset of all the three regions

together, but not for any of the separate datasets (Fig. 7) and for Italy plus New Zealand. This is

somehow  at  odds  with  heuristic  considerations  made  by  Utsu  (1961)  and  even  with  empirical

estimates by Guo and Ogata (1995, 1997), which found instead clear correlations (with opposite

signs), for a regional subdivision of Japanese sequences (interplate vs intraplate). In our case, the

correlation found for the joint set seems instead to be the effect of the artificial combination of non-

homogeneous data rather than a clear property of the sequences in different regions. The correlation

between b and c (or Log c) is instead not significant in all cases.

For Italy and particularly for New Zealand we find a clear positive correlation between p and c

(Fig.  8)  or  Log  c (Fig. 9). This is related to the interplay of the two parameters within the MLE

procedure.  In  fact,  it  is  easy  to  understand  how  an  high  c  value  (maybe  induced  by  the

incompleteness  of  the  data  in  the  first  times  after  the  mainshock)  has  the  effect  of  slowing  the

12

sequence decay for times t<c, and this in turn can be counterbalanced by an increase of the p-value.

This interplay is clearly revealed by Fig. 10, where we plotted the contours of the log-likelihood

function,  for  one  of  the  sequences  (B17)  analyzed  by  Lolli  and  Gasperini  (2003).  It  is  easy  to

understand how the location of the absolute maximum (marked with an asterisks) is only barely

constrained along the direction corresponding to the major axis of the highest contour level and thus

could vary along such direction due to the effect of data uncertainties and incompleteness.

A more deepened discussion of this argument is postponed to a future study as it must involve

the  analysis  of  the  physical  significance  of  p and c,  within  the  framework  of  more  physically

grounded models of aftershock occurrence such as those proposed by Kisslinger (1993) and Narteau

et al. (2002, 2003).

4.  Validation of the modified rate formula

To compare the forecasting efficiency of the modified formulation defined by eq. (13) and (14)

with respect to the original one by Reasenberg and Jones (1989), we analyzed a set of sequences,

occurred in Italy from 1997 to 2003, not considered by Lolli and Gasperini (2003) to estimate the

average values of the rate formula parameters. We used data taken from the on-line seismic bulletin

of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), relocated with the same procedures

applied to the catalog (CPTI Working Group, 2001) used by Lolli and Gasperini (2003) and with

magnitude revalued according to Gasperini (2002). We followed the same method applied in our

previous paper to detect the sequences (using both cluster5 code and a simpler algorithm with time

and space window varying with mainshock magnitude) and to evaluate their goodness of fit with

the Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model (by χ2 and Kolmorogov-Smirnov tests computed by the

aspar3x program). As well, we selected only the sequences with mainshock magnitude not smaller

than 4.3 and including at least 20 shocks. The list of detected sequences, reported in Table 6, does

not include the long and particularly productive macro-sequence occurred, from September 1997 to

June  1998,  in  the  Umbria-Marche  region  as  its  complexity  (5  strong  shocks  in  the  range  of  Ml

magnitude from 5.4 to 5.8) prevented a good fit with the simple MOM.

We simulate the forecasting of the Italian sequences from 1997 to 2003, for both the original

Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model and the modified one, using the average parameters previously

estimated by Lolli and Gasperini (2003). For the original Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model, as

suggested by Lolli and Gasperini (2003), we use the averages (arithmetic mean, weighted mean and

median)  of  parameters a and b  relative  to  only  the  20  sequences  occurred  from  1981  to  1996

(sequences from B17 to A30 of Dataset 1) when the catalog was more reliable. For the modified

13

model of eq. (13), we estimate the averages of parameters a1 and α by eq. (14) for the same set of

sequences (see Table 7). In both cases we used averages of parameters p and c as reported by Lolli

and Gasperini (2003) (also in Table 7). We compared the relative efficiency of the two formulations

by computing the ratio of their likelihoods with the new sequences.

The log-likelihood function for the Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model is given by (i.e. Ogata,

1983; Lolli and Gasperini, 2003)

(

      (18)

where  ti and  N  are  respectively  the  occurrence  times  and  the  total  number  of  shocks  in  each

sequence within the time range from S to T. For the modified model of eq. (13) the log-likelihood

function is given by

(

l GL a1,b1, p,c
  

so that the log-likelihood ratio becomes

If LR is positive, then the Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model works better than the modified

one. Conversely the latter overperforms the former when LR is negative.

From  Table  6  we  can  see  how  L R  values  are  negative  (highlighted  with  bold  type)  for  the

majority of the sequences (11 over 17). As well the cumulative LR values (sum of all sequence LR

values) are negative in all cases. These results confirm the stability with time of our findings in Italy

and  indicate  that  the  modified  model  might  significantly  improve  the  ability  to  forecast  future

sequences behavior.

5.  Application of the modified formula to ETAS processes

The modified rate formula (13) can be easily applied to more complex processes of epidemic

type (Ogata, 1988) where all the shocks of the sequence, and not only the mainshock, are assumed

to induce further aftershocks. Under the hypothesis that the parameters of eq. (13) are the same for

all “mother shocks” (generating aftershocks), the global aftershock rate equation becomes

λ t( ) =

N m t( )

∑

j =1

10a1 +αM j −bM min
) p
(

t − u j + c

(21)

(cid:0) 

14

where Nm(t) is the number of mother shocks (including mainshock) occurred before time t; uj and Mj

are respectively the occurrence time and the magnitude of the j-th mother shock. We can note that

the value of α is now constrained by the magnitude distribution of mother shocks and hence can be

estimated simultaneously to a1. On the other hand, the role of parameters a1, p, and c in eq. (21) is

not exactly the same as in eq. (13), thus we can expect that their MLE are slightly different from the

ones obtained by the simple MOM. In this simplified approach we completely neglect the spatial

distribution  of  shocks  that  thus  are  all  considered  to  occur  at  the  same  place  of  the  mainshock.

Although  this  assumption  might  appear  a  defect,  it  however  reduces  the  risk  that  the  smaller

mother-shocks are favoured in predicting the location of triggered seismicity with respect to the

stronger ones, and thus that their contribution to triggering might be overestimated (see discussion

in Helmstetter et al, in press).

to eq. (17) is given by

According to the procedure described by Ogata (1983), the log-likelihood function corresponding

where again, Nm(ti) and Nm(tN) are the number of mother shocks occurring before the shock at time ti

and before the last shock of the sequence respectively. We maximized equation (22), for the data of

some  Italian  sequences  detected  by  Lolli  and  Gasperini  (2003)  using  the  Fortran  routine

BCONG/DBCONG of the IMSL Math library (Visual Numerics, 1997). Such code uses a quasi-

Newton method (Dennis and Schnabel, 1983) and an active set strategy (Gil and Murray, 1976) to

solve optimization problems subject to simple bounds.

In order to reliably constrain parameter α, we only considered sequences with at least 200 shocks

above Mmin. Moreover, we applied the same procedure to some complex sequences that Lolli and

Gasperini  (2003)  were  not  able  to  model  due  the  bad  fit  or  that  they  had  to  subdivide  into

subsequences as well as to the long and very productive sequence occurred from September 1997 to

June 1998 in the Umbria-Marche region.

The  results  are  shown  in  Table  8,  where  the  parameters  of  the  Reasenberg  and  Jones  (1989)

model, estimated by Lolli and Gasperini (2003) for the same sequences, are also reported when

available. In general we can note that, according to previous findings (Guo and Ogata, 1997), p is

slightly  larger  for  the  ETAS  model  than  for  the  simple  MOM.  For  only  one  sequence  (B35),

characterized  by  a  very  small  mainshock  magnitude  (Ml=4.3),  the  p value for the ETAS model

results smaller than 1.0.

15

On the other hand we can also observe that estimated α values are in most cases significantly

lower  than  b.  The  arithmetic  averages  are  respectively 

α = 0.79 ± 0.07   and 

b = 1.03 ± 0.11

(

α /b = 0.77).  This  difference  becomes  more  evident  when  considering  instead  the  averages

naturally weighted with the inverse of the squared errors that are respectively 

α = 0.62 ± 0.02  and

(cid:0) 

(cid:0) 

b = 0.89 ± 0.03 (

α /b = 0.69). These results indicate that, for the analyzed sequences, a coefficient

of Mm definitely smaller than b seems to better account for the magnitude dependence of mother-

shock productivity.

5. Conclusions

From a correlation analysis of parameter estimates, made by different authors in three regions of

the  world,  we  deduced  a  modified  form  (eq.  13)  of  the  Reasenberg  and  Jones  (1989)  time-

magnitude distribution of simple aftershock sequences where the parameters are almost independent

of  each  other  and  thus  are  more  likely  to  represent  true  physical  properties  of  the  aftershock

occurrence process. In particular an average value of magnitude productivity coefficient α about

2/3b as  well  as  an  average  value  of  magnitude  independent  productivity  a1  close  to  0  seem  to

represent common characteristics of aftershock sequences in different regions.

The proposed modification have a significant impact on forecasting since it implies a definitely

different dependence of aftershock rate as a function of mainshock magnitude with respect to one

predicted by the original model. Namely, for stronger mainshocks, aftershock rates are lower for the

modified model than for the original one and conversely they are higher for weaker mainshocks.

We verified that the modified formula improves the ability to forecast aftershocks behavior in the

first hours or days after the mainshock, before specific information on the ongoing sequence are

available, by comparing the log-likelihood functions of the original and modified formulation with

a different set of Italian sequences.

We also introduced in the formulation of eq. (13) the epidemic principle (Ogata, 1988) where

each shock of the sequence is the source of further aftershocks. Differently from the simple model

with  a  single  mainshock,  the  rate  equation  (21)  allows  to  estimating  at  the  same  time  both

parameters a1 and α  from  the  data  of  a  single  sequence  as  the  latter  is  now  constrained  by  the

magnitude distribution of mother shocks. The results of the application of this epidemic model to a

set of Italian sequences well agrees with our previous findings as it gives averages of parameter α

definitely lower than b by a factor ranging from 0.7 to 0.8.

16

Values of α<b have been estimated already by ETAS modeling of the entire Italian seismicity

(Console et al., 2003) and by a stacking of triggered events in Southern California (Helmstetter,

2003).  These  works  found  α=0.5b  and α=0.8  respectively  although  a  more  recent  paper

(Helmstetter  et  al,  in  press),  using  a  slightly  modified  procedure,  have  got α=1.0  for  the  same

dataset of Helmstetter (2003). The latter estimate also agrees with the work by Felzer et al. (2004)

which  found  a  value  close  to  1.0  being  compatible  with  the  seismicity  of  California.  The

discrepancy  between  our  results  and  such  works  could  be  due  to  the  fact  that  we  capture  the

properties  of  a  somehow  different  phenomenon,  as  we  consider  relatively  short  aftershock

sequences, well fitting a simple MOM decay, rather than the entire seismicity of a region over a

long time interval. In fact, the aftershocks belonging to simple sequences usually occur along single

faults, then the fractal dimension D  of their hypocentral distribution is likely to be significantly

lower than the value expected for the long-term seismicity of a region. Together with the hypothesis

that α≈D/2 this would bring to a value of the coefficient of mainshock magnitude for the triggered

seismicity along single faults significantly lower than 1.0 found by Helmstetter et al. (in press) and

Felzer (2004). As well, the significantly higher α value we observed in ETAS modeling of Italian

sequences, with respect to the work of Console et al. (2003), could be explained by our choice of

neglecting the spatial distribution of shocks: this in fact reduces the risk that the smaller mother

shocks are favoured in predicting the location of triggered seismicity with respect to the stronger

ones and thus that their productivity is overestimated.

On  the  other  hand,  differently  to  other  models  which  requires  the  real-time  location  of  all

shocks  above  a  minimum  threshold,  but  similarly  to  the  Reasenberg  and  Jones  (1989)  one,  our

modified formula can be immediately used to forecast aftershock rates and probabilities in the first

times after a mainshock, only on the basis of mainshock magnitude. This can be done through eq.

(13)  taking α=0.65b  and  the  averages  of  a 1  reported  in  Table  3  for  Italy,  New-Zealand  and

California.

In agreement with Kisslinger and Jones (1991), who analyzed most of the California sequences

of our dataset 3, we found the absence of correlation between p and b in most cases. This contrasts

with heuristic considerations made by Utsu (1961) as well as with empirical estimates made for

Japan  by  Guo  and  Ogata  (1995,  1997).  Although  the  point  remains  controversial,  we  can

confidently  assert  that  such  correlation  does  not  represent  a  general  property  of  aftershock

sequences in different parts of the world.

The weak but significant positive correlation found between p and c in most cases might indicate

a  bias  in  the  estimates  of  parameter  p  due  to  its  interplay  with  parameter  c.  A  higher c  value

17

corresponds,  in  fact,  to  a  slower  decay  in  the  first  times  after  the  mainshocks  that  can  be

counterbalanced by a higher p-value and vice versa. This interplay could even be the source of the

correlation found between MOM parameters and magnitude independent productivity a.  In  fact,

while different combinations of p and c may give, in many cases, rather similar rate decays within

the observation time window [S,T], the ratio between the number shocks N actually observed in the

same time window and the total number of shock Ntot may vary considerably as a function of p.

Even considering the incompleteness of the aftershock datasets (particularly in the first times after a

strong  mainshock),  that  might  influence  the  estimate  of  parameter  c,  this  variability  can

significantly affect the estimated value of a.   This interpretation is confirmed by the absence of

correlation between a and p for the California dataset where c is kept fixed to 0.05 and thus cannot

influence the estimate of p.

The  trade-off  between  p  and  c  might  also  indicate  a  general  inadequacy  of  the  MOM  in

describing the real properties of simple sequences that however requires further deepening in the

light of more physical approaches to the definition of aftershock decay process recently developed.

In this view, the renormalization of the time dependent part of the rate equation could be useful to

separate it from the magnitude dependent part and to make estimates of the sequence productivity

that are completely independent of the time decay law.

Table 1 – Correlation analysis between productivity parameters a,  a1 and a2 with b, bMm and αMm.

“Coeff” and “Coeff std” indicate the regression coefficient and its standard deviation, “Intcep” and

“Intcep std” the regression intercept term with its standard deviation, “r” the correlation coefficient,

“t” the value of Student-t statistics for the null hypothesis of absence of correlation, “d.f.” and “s.l.”

the degrees of freedom and the significance level of t-test, column “corr” reports the sign (positive

or negative) of correlation, when significant, or blank otherwise. “New Zealand (Ml)” in the dataset

column, indicates that Mm, M min and b values for New Zealand are converted from Mw to Ml to

conform other regions.

Table 2 – Correlation analysis between a and bMm using bootstrap resampling technique. For each

dataset, the first row reports the results of standard linear regression, the second one the average

values computed over the set of 5000 resamplings and the third one the median values. Regression

coefficient uncertainties are computed in the second row as standard deviations of the distribution

of values obtained from resampling, while in the third and fourth ones as the difference between the

median and the 16th and 84th percentiles of the same distribution of values.

Table 3 – Averages and standard deviations (std) of magnitude independent productivity a and its

transformations a0, a1 and a2 (see text) for the three region separately and for the joint dataset of all

thee region together. Columns “a-a0 std”, “a-a1 std”, “a1-a2 std” and “a-a2 std” report the standard

deviation  variation  between  corresponding  parameters  in  percentage.  “New  Zealand  (Ml)”  and

“Joint  (Ml)”  in  the  dataset  column  indicate  that  Mm, M min  and  b  values  for  New  Zealand  are

converted from Mw to Ml to conform other regions.

Table 4 – Correlation analysis of productivity parameters a, a0, a1 and a2 with p, c and Log c. The

explanation of different columns is the same as of Table 1.

Table 5 – Correlation analysis between b, p, c and Log c. The explanation of different columns is

the same as of Table 1.

Table 6 – List of Italian sequences used for the validation of the new rate formula. Lat, Lon and Mm

are the coordinates and the magnitude of the mainshock, Mmin and N the minimum magnitude and

the total number of aftershocks, S and T the starting and ending time of the modeled sequence (in

34

days),  LRAV,  LRWA,  LRMD  the  log-likelihood  ratios  between  the  original  Reasenberg  and  Jones

(1989) model and the new model defined by eq. (13) and (14) when the values of model parameters

used are computed as arithmetic average, weighted average and median respectively.

Table 7 – Values of average parameters used for the validation of the new rate formula.

Table 8 – Results of the application the epidemic type model of eq. (17) to seven Italian sequences.

“Seq.”  indicates  the  sequence  code  assigned  by  Lolli  and  Gasperini  (2003), Mm  the  mainshock

magnitude, Mmin the magnitude minimum threshold, N the total number of shock above Mmin, pMOM,

cMOM, bMOM and aMOM the estimates of the Reasenberg and Jones (1989) model parameters made by

Lolli and Gasperini (2003), pETAS, cETAS, bETAS, α and a1 the estimates of the ETAS model parameters

(eq. 17), std b  and std α the standard deviation of ETAS parameters bETAS, α respectively.

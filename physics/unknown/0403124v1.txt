Hubble Energy 

 

Alasdair Macleod ¶ 

ABSTRACT 

Light received from a cosmological source is redshifted with an apparent loss of energy, a problem first pointed 

out by Edwin Hubble in 1936. A new type of energy called Hubble Energy is introduced to restore the principle of 

energy conservation. The energy has no inertial or gravitational effect but retards radial motion in a manner 

consistent with the anomalous acceleration experienced by the Pioneer probes leaving the solar system. The energy 

is predicted to have important effects on the scale of galaxies, and some of these effects are qualitatively 

examined: for example, with Hubble Energy, flat rotation curves are found to be an inevitable consequence of 

spiral galaxy formation. The Hubble Energy is incorporated into the Friedmann Equation and shown to add a term 

similar to the cosmological term, with a magnitude of order 10-35s-2.

In this paper, the new concept of Hubble Energy is

which the universe is expanding. The value is

The distinction is important. If the Hubble Energy 

has a preferred frame (as expected), the logical 

reference frame is the gravitational potential centred 

on the Sun. If the Energy is relative (which would 

lead to conceptual problems - see Section 5), the 

acceleration will be directed towards the observer. 

There is the greater problem of why the Hubble 

force is not experienced by planets within the solar 

system. Although the anomalous acceleration is 

small, the effect on planetary dynamics would 

quickly have been noted through its cumulative 

effect. One difference, of course, is that celestial 

bodies in the Solar System are bound to the 

gravitational mass (cid:150) the spacecraft are not. Is there a 

fundamental difference between bound and 

unbound states? 

It is suggested here that there does exist a 

fundamental difference. Unbound systems 

experience propagation delays of the order of the 

distance separation divided by the speed of light 

(forces are retarded). However it is proposed that 

components of a bound system do not experience 

propagation delays in their interaction.  

Pioneer probes were moving at a much higher speed 

This definition of a bound system suggests a deep

it now follows that the Hubble velocity within a 

gravitationally bound system is zero regardless of 

the physical separation. The Hubble expansion only 

comes into effect once the interacting objects are 

free. Relative to one another bound objects have 

Hubble Energy of zero. No distinction is made 

between gravitationally and electro-magnetically 

bound systems at this stage. 

The Pioneer anomalous acceleration will therefore 

appear only when the spacecraft escape the solar 

system. Unfortunately, the data from the transition 

region has not yet been analysed. 

For reasons that will come apparent, it is necessary 

to be very precise in the definition of the energy

galaxy size and formation because of unusual

Consider the case of a test mass m at distance r from 

central mass M. Further; assume the mass has zero 

radial velocity but a transverse velocity of u. There 

is the surprising possibility that the centripetal and 

gravitational forces can balance but that the system 

can be unbound. The test mass is then subject to an 

outward expansion velocity that separates it from 

the central mass over time.

Galaxies are complex in their morphology and 

evolution and there are many factors at work in their 

development. However, the limiting condition 

derived above can be applied to simple mass 

aggregations to establish some of the qualitative 

ways the Hubble energy could affect the properties 

of galaxies.

pc-2. However, the cores of most galaxies are very 

old, of the order of 10 billion years. The stars must 

therefore also be very old with a much lower light-

to-mass ratio than the sun, which is only about 5 

billion years old. Light from the centre also tends to 

be obscured by dust.  

There is some evidence that the central luminosity 

of spiral galaxies is constant but at the level of 145

but ellipsoidal or bar shaped. The mean mass 

surface density is independent of topology but the 

transition between the bound and unbound states. 
The critical condition GM/r2 = 2ao which then exists 
at the end of the bars can change with time. The 
acceleration ao decreases with time and GM/r2 can 
vary through a variety of processes: 

•  A change in the value of G with time 
•  Mass loss from jet action at the galaxy 

core if the nucleus is active 

• 

Equivalent mass loss through radiation 

The first option is not significant  - there is no 

evidence the gravitation constant varies, but 

undoubtedly mass can change. If the total mass loss 

per year is greater than about 10 solar masses, the 

gravitational acceleration at the ends of the bar falls 

below threshold with the result that material 

previously bound becomes free and begins to move 

outwards as the Hubble velocity kicks in.  

The formation of spiral arms in disk galaxies is 

complex but we would expect the arms to originate 

from the ends of the bars through this process. For 

example, a near infra-red image of the core of M51 

(the Whirlpool Galaxy, NGC 5194/5195) 

reproduced in Seeds, p234 

8
, shows two spiral arm 

winding deeply into the core of the galaxy to the 

ends of a small bar. The outwards movement of 

material subsequent to (cid:145)ejection(cid:146) is at low velocity 

and would be difficult to detect from redshift 

observations. 

We can check the plausibility of this scenario with a 

rough calculation of the properties of the Milky 

Way galaxy (data taken from Seeds

8
): The radius of 

the nuclear bulge is about 3 kpc (9.2 x 1019 m). The 

 

Page 6 

Hubble Energy 
 

mass is estimated at 1.86 x 1041 kg. The boundary 
acceleration is therefore 14.6 x 10-10 m s-2, very 

close to 2 times ao. The Hubble radial velocity of 

the sun now (at a distance of 8.5 kpc) is about 0.6 
km s-1. Since this will remain constant in the

The flat rotation curves of disk galaxies can be 

explained by dark matter but requires unusual 

cooperation between dark and baryonic matter (the 
(cid:145)disk-halo conspiracy(cid:146) 9).  The endpoint of the 

rotation curves is a function of luminosity only (the 

Tully-Fisher relation) and puts severe constraints on 
the nature of the dark matter halo10. Detailed 

application of the Hubble acceleration can explain 

the flat rotation curves in a fairly straightforward 

way:

It is possible to show that the rotation speed of the 

ejected material will be constant at any time by 

calculating the rotational history of mass escaping at 

an arbitrary time T.  Assuming the mass was 

rotationally bound before escape, the initial

The rotation speed is independent of radial position, 

although it declines steadily over time. In this 

analysis, information about central density variation 

is locked into the rotation curve as a deviation from 

the flat velocity curve.  

However, real curves are not flat near the centre and 

it is unlikely that the density of a galaxy is constant.  

The predictive failure of equation (16) lies in the 

assumptions that have been made. A more realistic 

calculation must include the centripetal acceleration. 

It is found that the centripetal acceleration adds a 

small radial velocity, which is more significant 

when the distance from the centre is small. The 

small size of the additional outward velocity may 

seem surprising - one would expect the centripetal 

acceleration should quickly give rise to an 

overwhelming radial velocity. High-speed outward 

movement of this type would be apparent and 

simply does not occur.  

In fact, the Hubble acceleration prevents the 

velocity growing through equation (4). As an 

outward peculiar velocity grows, an opposing 

Hubble acceleration builds up to balance the 

centripetal acceleration (this is similar to the 

engineering principle of (cid:145)proportional control(cid:146) 

where the induced peculiar velocity would be 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

velocity is much smaller than the Hubble velocity 

when the centripetal acceleration (minus the 

gravitational acceleration) falls significantly below 

ao. 

The procedure conserves energy and angular 

momentum. At distance r, let the centripetal force

Substituting equation (17), the RHS simplifies to 0. 

The Hubble force therefore conserves angular 

momentum. The process moves angular momentum 

outwards from the centre of the galaxy. 

With the assumption that vH >> vP, true with r large 

in the current epoch, equation (17) simplifies to 
u2=vPc. A larger u will result in a greater peculiar 
velocity and thus a greater reduction in u. A detailed 

analysis shows that the contribution from the

This is still less than the emitted energy hence there 

is an apparent unexplained energy loss associated 

with the photon transfer event when considered 

from the emission frame. The energy associated 

with the recoil velocity has been ignored as this can 

be made arbitrarily small by a suitable choice of 

emitter and absorber masses. 

The discrepancy is surprising. It is true of Special 

Relativity that observers in different frames can 

measure different energies for the same event 

(because of the rotation of Energy-Momentum 

vector) but all will observe energy and momentum 

conservation in any energy transfer process.  This 

problem with the cosmological redshift is accepted 

in cosmology because General Relativity does not 

absolutely admit energy conservation unless some 

sort of curvature energy is ascribed to the metric 

(this has yet to be quantitatively demonstrated). This 

is paradoxical because the Friedmann equation that 

describes the universe is derived on the basis of 

energy conservation (the kinetic energy of the 

Hubble flow loses energy as it works against 

gravity). It should be noted that the gravitational 

redshift does conserve energy (cid:150) the redshift is 

associated with real energy loss as the photon 

escapes the gravitational energy well. Historically, a 

refusal to accept energy non-conservation led to the 

discovery of the neutrino. 

Flat rotation curves in disk galaxies are therefore 

not unusual (cid:150) they may be inevitable. This is a 

simpler explanation than invoking dark matter or 

altering the gravitational force equation.  

Looking again at equation (9) in light of energy 

conservation; where does the Hubble energy go 

when a mass makes the transition from the free to 

bound state? It is proposed that the energy becomes 

associated with the gravitational system and has a 

cosmological significance. If a mass at the threshold 

acceleration is captured at time T1 then escapes at 

time T2 (captured and emerging in the same place), 
there is a nett loss of energy of mc2 (1/T1-1/T2). 
During the time the mass was bound, the universe 

has expanded and the gravitational energy of the 

universe has reduced. It is possible that on a global 

level the effects balance. 

5. Energy Loss with Redshift 

A major source of concern with the big bang model 

is the apparent violation of the principle of energy 

conservation by the cosmological expansion. The 

received energy is less than that emitted, in the case 

of the cosmic background radiation, by a factor of 

over one thousand. 

Consider the case of photon emission to a distant 

absorber moving away from the emitter with a 

Hubble velocity v. In the rest frame of the emitter, 

the emitted energy is Eem. It is known both from 

relativity and experimentally that the absorbed 

energy Eabs (in the rest frame of the absorber) is

Hubble Energy 
 

The introduction of the Hubble energy resolves the 

problem and restores energy conservation. If we

The Hubble Energy has been introduced in a simple 

way and has been shown to offer qualitative 

(23) 

explanations to some outstanding cosmological 

problems.  

The RHS of the equation simplifies to Eem - energy 

is conserved. 

Now consider the situation from the viewpoint of 

the absorber. This is the viewpoint when observing 

distant objects from the Earth. From the previous 

argument we know the received energy is reduced 

and is consistent with that actually measured, but 

from the absorber frame, the situation should be 

very different. The distant photon will have 

additional energy because the Hubble energy of the 

source recession velocity is recovered. Thus the 

received energy should be greater by a factor (1 + 

v/c). Why is it not? The point is that the situation is 

not symmetrical. The symmetry is broken by both 

the expansion of the universe and the time arrow (cid:150) 

photons travel in the direction of positive time only. 

Thus, the absorber is moving away from the emitter 

at velocity v, but the emitter is not moving away 

from the observer at velocity v (even though the 

relative velocity is certainly v).  Once a photon has 

left the emitter, the subsequent movement of the 

emitter is irrelevant. Not so with the absorber (cid:150) the 

velocity history affects propagation time. The 

situation is clearly not symmetrical. 

There is a preferred frame, but in cosmology this is 

acceptable; for example the cosmic background 

radiation defines a zero velocity reference frame 

against which the absolute motion of the Earth 

through space is measured. 

It should be noted that the Hubble Energy, if it 

exists, should affect the development of the 

Universe. The universe is modelled with the 

Friedmann Equation. A simple way to derive the 

equation is by imagining a sphere expanding with 

time and applying energy conservation at the 

extreme edge 

11. The resulting equation is normally 

modified to include a cosmological term with 
characteristic constant lambda (Λ):

R is the radius of the universe, ρ is the mean

that the universe is flat, hence κ = 0. 

By attributing Hubble energy to the edge of the 

sphere, the Friedmann equation modifies to

Fitting plausible values to equation (26), we can 
estimate that Γ has a value of about  -3 x 10-35 s-2. It 

may be tempting to identify gamma with the 

existing cosmological constant but analysis of the 

WMAP cosmic background data

positive value of lambda (although of similar 
magnitude). Λ/3H2 was found to be 0.73 and the 
equivalent value of Λ is +1.1 x 10-35 s-2.

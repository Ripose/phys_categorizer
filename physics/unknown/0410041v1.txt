ABSTRACT 

            Beam  premodulation  on  free  electron 
laser  (FEL)  offers  considerable 
enhancement  in  gain  and  efficiency  when  the  phase  of  the  premodulated  beam  is  –p /2 

and the beam is highly modulated implying the maximum beam oscillatory velocity due 

to  wiggler.  The  growth  rate  of  the  FEL  instability  increases  with  the  modulation  index 

and reaches maximum when the modulation index ∆ ~ 1·0.  

Keywords : FEL, Wiggler, Gain and Efficiency 

1. INTRODUCTION 

                  The free electron laser (FEL) is a fascinating device for an efficient generation 
of  high  power  coherent  radiation  in  a  wide  band  of  frequencies1-3.  Recently,  there  has 
been growing interest in studying the free electron laser (FEL)4-5 by prebunched electron 

beams.

One looks for a solution of Eq. (15) around the simultaneous zeros of the left hand side. 

The  first  factor  when  equated  to  zero,  gives  the  radiation  mode  while  the  second  one 

gives the beam space charge mode. We write

3. RESULTS   

 
In the calculations we have used parameters for the experiment of Cohen et al4-5 

and  the  corresponding  parameters  are  :  electron  beam  energy  Eb    =0.07  MeV  ,  beam 
current Ib=1.2A, and beam cross-section Ab = 0.126 cm2, wiggler field Bw  = 300 Gauss, 
wiggler wavelength l w =4.42 cm, the modulation frequency  of the  premodulated beam 
w 0  =4.25GHz,  electric  field   E1  =  50 esu. In Fig. 2, we have plotted the variation of the 
growth rate (in rad. sec–1) in the Raman regime [using Eq. (16)] with modulation index D

when the phase of the premodulated electron beam is  –p /2, i.e., when the beam is in the 

retarding  zone.  The  growth  rate  of  the  FEL  instability  increases  with  the  modulation 
index and has the largest value when D
 ~ 
1·64 x 108 rad. sec–1. In Fig. 3, we have plotted the Gain versus frequency (in GHz). The 

 ~ 1·0 . For D =0, the value of the growth rate G

parameters are same as Fig. 2 and for the interaction length L = 100 cm. We can see from 

the Fig. 3 , that our theoretical plot is similar to the experimental observation of Cohen et 
al4 . In our theoretical calculation the gain is found around 0.18 at frequency 4·5 GHz. In 
the  experimental  observation  of  Cohen  et  al4,  the  gain  increases  with  frequency  and 

reaches  maximum  ~  0·18  at  frequency  ~  4·539  GHz.  Hence  our  theoretical  results 

qualitatively  and  quantitatively  are  similar  to  the  experimental  observation  of  Cohen  et 
al4.  As  the  modulation  index  increases,  the  growth  rate  of  the  FEL  instability  increases 

and this implies the enhancement in the efficiency of FEL devices [cf. Eq. (18)].

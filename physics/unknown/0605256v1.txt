Circulation generated by a bluff body 
 
T. S. Morton*

In an effort to understand the loss in circulation sometimes cited in connection with 
bluff-body wakes, an estimate is derived for the circulation in the wake of a cylinder. 
Predictions  of  the  dimensionless  circulation  are  comparable  to  observed  values, 
regardless of the velocity profile assumed at the point of separation. This suggests that 
the  total  circulation  generated  by  a  bluff  body  may  have  been  overestimated  in  the 
past, along with any subsequent “losses” in circulation implied by it. 
 

 

1.  Introduction 

The purpose of this study is to provide an estimate of the mean circulation generated by a 
 
bluff  body  in  steady  motion  through  a  fluid.  Roshko  (1954)  estimated  this  circulation  to  be 
pb  is  the  base  pressure 
generated  at  a  rate  of

coefficient,  and 
following dimensionless form of this estimate in a study of square section cylinders:

where  Γ   is  the  total  circulation  generated  by  the  body,  and  D  is  the  body  dimension.  This 
estimate predicts a total circulation of more than twice that typically found in bluff-body wakes, 
and it is generally believed that half or more of the vorticity is cancelled in the near wake due to 
mixing (Bearman and Obasaju 1982). The fact that Fage and Johansen (1927) were only able to 
account for roughly 60% of the total vorticity nine body lengths downstream, which led them to 
first suggest the mixing of positive and negative vorticity in the wake, appears to be the origin 
of  the  justification  of  (1).  They  later  (Fage  and  Johansen  1928)  made  detailed  graphical 
estimates  in  the  near  wake,  however,  and  appear  to  have  adequately  accounted  for  the  total 
vorticity  to  within  10%  error.  Subsequent  studies  have  shown  that  only  35~45%  of  the  total 
vorticity predicted by (1) can be found in the near wake (see Cantwell and Coles 1983, Lyn et 
al. 1995). Davies (1976) found that only 26% of the vorticity predicted by (1) is found in the 
wake  of  a  D-shaped  cylinder  8  diameters  downstream.  Wu  et  al.  (1994)  reported  a  value  of

(Balligand  2000).  Zdravkovich  (1989)  characterized  the  anomalous  mixing  of  positive  and 
negative vorticity as “a long standing puzzle.” In what follows, an estimate of the dimensionless 
circulation will be derived using a contour integration that includes the attached boundary layer 
on  a  circular  cylinder  in  cross  flow.  Predictions  are  significantly  lower  than  those  of  (1)  and 
agree  fairly  well  with  values  cited  above.  In  particular,  it  can  be  seen  that  regardless  of  the 
velocity profile from the point of separation, the dimensionless circulation generated up to the 
point of separation is near 2.0 for a circular cylinder.

2.  Cylinder Wake Circulation 

Due to the no slip condition of the attached boundary layer, a bluff body such as a circular 
 
cylinder transmits a torque to the fluid passing it. This torque sets some region of the fluid in 
motion  rotationally.  The  resulting  circulation  can  be  determined  by  performing  the  following 
contour integration

 shown in

Figure 1. The subscript “(1/2)” in (2) indicates that 
along the loop 
this represents only half of the total circulation generated by a symmetric mean flow about the 
cylinder.  The  contour  integration  is  performed  in  4  parts.  On  the  curve  γ1  (see  Figure  1),  the 
approaching fluid decelerates and stagnates according to the velocity distribution for ideal fluid 
flow  past  a  cylinder  (n  = 2)  or  a  sphere  (n  =  3).  Along  γ2,  which  terminates  at  the  separation 
point, the velocity is zero due to the no-slip condition. 
 
as the following: 

The time-mean velocity on the contour γ3 can be modeled, for example, by a function such

The middle term handles the no-slip condition by bringing the velocity from 0 at the body to 1 
at infinity. The term on the right gives the well-known bulge to the velocity profile (see Figure 
2). Here, a is the radius of the cylinder, and the constants 
, q, and m are all positive. This 
“peak”  term  on  the  right  side  of 
(3)  has  more  flexibility  to  fit  velocity  profile  data  than,  for 
example, the vortex of Oseen (1912) which, if modified for the presence of a body, would be:

Since (3) is to represent the velocity profile at separation, the direction of v is more or less 
 
parallel  to  the  free  stream,  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  Therefore,  the  velocity  component  in  the 
direction of γ3 can be obtained by multiplying (3) by 
, where θ is the separation angle. The

.  This  can  also  be  seen  by  noting  that  the  integral  of  the  velocity  along  γ

studied  by  Scully  and  Sullivan  (1972;  see  also  Sullivan  1975).  When  the  separation  angle  is

such cases. For

3/2 for a sphere, regardless of the fit chosen for the velocity profile on the contour γ
shows  a  wide  range  of  possible  velocity  profiles  on  γ3,  and  Table  1  shows  the  curve-fitting 
constants used to obtain these curves. Figure 3 illustrates the range of values predicted by (5) 
for  the  various  velocity  profiles  shown  in  Figure  2.  Here,  the  final  term  in  (5)  is  integrated 
numerically. An alternative to the peaking function in (3) that appears to be as adaptable as (3) 
in the region of interest is contained in the following:

Although  series  representations  exist  for  the  integral  of  the  term  on  the  right,  it  is  simpler  to 
integrate  numerically.  Furthermore,  the  integral  is  simple  enough  that  its  behavior  can  be

Table 1.  Curve-fitting constants for cases plotted in Figure 2 and Figure 3. 

Each point of a given curve in Figure 3 corresponds to a separation point on the cylinder, 
 
from  which  the  velocity  profile  is  assumed  to  emanate.  However,  the  velocity  profile  is  not 
assumed to also emanate from all points on γ2 upstream of the separation point; therefore, the 
trend of a given curve in Figure 3 cannot be taken to represent the accumulation of circulation 
with  the  distance  traveled  along  γ2.  It  appears  from  Figure  3  that  for  most  typical  velocity 
profiles and separation angles, the predicted dimensionless circulation lies in the range:

For an 80º separation angle, for example, if one requires that the velocity profile decrease from 
  within  one  diameter  of  either  side  of  the 
some  maximum  to  a  value  no  greater  than 
∞v1.5
cylinder and to a value no greater than 
 within 4 diameters of either side of the cylinder, 
∞v1.2
then the upper bound in 
(8) certainly holds, regardless of the values chosen for the curve-fitting 
constants.  At  the  point  of  separation  on  the  surface,  the  tangential  velocity  should  obey  the

This effect is not modeled by the velocity profiles used in this study; however, its contribution 
to the integrals in (5) and (7) is very small. 

In  summary,  the  values  predicted  by  (2),  implemented  herein  by  (5),  are  considerably 
 
smaller than those predicted by (1). This may help explain the “loss” in circulation sometimes 
referred to when using (1).

/(

2/π=θ

An  estimate  of  the  total  circulation  generated  by  a  circular  cylinder  is  derived  by 
 
integrating  the  velocity  on  a  loop  containing  the  attached  boundary  layer  up  to  the  point  of 
separation. The estimate is weakly dependent upon the velocity downstream of separation. For a 
, the prediction is independent of this downstream velocity, being 
separation angle of 
 when the approach velocity is modeled by ideal flow about a cylinder (in which

=∞vDΓ
case  the  velocity  exponent  is 
).  The  method,  which  is  based  on  the  assumption  that 
circulation is generated only by the attached boundary layer, gives estimates that are closer to 
observed values than previous estimates.

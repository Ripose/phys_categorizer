Abstract 

 

 

Some  agent-based  models  for  growth  and  allocation  of  resources  are  described.  The  first  class 

considered consists  of conservative models, where  the  number  of agents and  the  size  of  resources 

are constant during time evolution. The second class is made up of multiplicative noise models and 

some of their extensions to continuous-time. 

Key words: Equilibrium, Growth

1. Introduction 

In this paper, we present a survey on some important classes of simple agent-based models used for 

the simulation of either growth processes or the allocation of resources in economics. These models 

represent systems where there are N agents that can interact. The interactions can be direct and can 

include both two-body and many-body terms, but they can also be indirect, through some coupling 

and  feedback  mechanism  with  an  external  “field”.  For  instance,  this  is  the  role  of  the  banking 

system  in  some  agent-based  models  for  firm  growth.  Each  agent  i  is  characterized  by  a  certain 

quantity  si,  which  represents  either  size,  or  wealth  or  another  relevant  quantity.  The  interactions 

determine  a  variation  of  si  as  a  function  of  time.  In  principle,  the  evolution  of  the  system  can  be 

described  both  in  continuous  time  and  in  discrete  time.  There  are  various  paradigms  helping  in 

making  the  previous  informal  description  of  agent-based  models  more  rigorous.  It  is  worth 

mentioning the so-called Interacting Particle Systems that include, as special cases, percolation, the 

Ising  model,  the  voter  model,  and  the  contact  model  [1].  Muchnick  and  Solomon,  in  [2],  have 

proposed  a framework taking explicitly into account causality.  

In  the  following,  we  first  present  very  simple  money-exchange  games  where  the  total  number  of 
agents and the aggregate size  (cid:1)=

are conserved. Depending on the specific model S may have

the meaning of money and/or wealth. These models have been used to discuss the random allocation 

of resources. Then, we pass to the simplest growth models with multiplicative noise (MN). They are 

the  basis  on  which  the  so-called  Generalized  Lotka-Volterra  (GLV)  models  are  built  (Solomon, 

2000).  In  these  models,  the  logarithm  of  the  size  is  the  sum  of  independent  and  identically 
distributed random variables and they are directly related to the pioneering work of Gibrat1 [3] (see 

also  [4]  and  [5])  as  well  as  to  more  recent  studies  on  the  applications  of continuous-time  random 

walks  in  finance  and  economics  (in  [6],  [7],  [8],  [9],  [10]  and  [11]).  Moreover,  these  models  are 

useful tools in the study of stochastic aggregation. Indeed, for a given period or time, MN models 

give a value of the aggregate that is, in its turn, a stochastic variable and, in general, the distribution 

of S may differ from the distribution of si. 

 

 

2. Conservative models 

We consider two instances of conservative models, the One Parameter Inequality Process (OPIP) by 

John Angle ([12], [13], [14]) and the Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) process by Bennati ([15], [16]). In 

these models, the number of agents N and the aggregate size S do not change with time.  

The  OPIP  can  be  described  as  follows.  Suppose  that  there  are  N  players  in  a  room,  each  of  them 

with  an  initial  amount  of  money,

.  Two  players  are  selected  by  chance  to  play  against  each 

( )0is

other. They flip a coin and the winner gets from the loser a fixed fraction,

money. Then, the game is iterated. If, j and k are the selected players at step t, their money at step 

t+1 is given by:

inequalities in many different economical phenomena.

The  MB  model  described  in  [15]  and  [16]  is  very  similar  to  the  OPIP,  but  there  is  an  important 

difference.  After  the  coin  toss,  the  winner  receives  a  fixed  amount  of  money,  d.  Indebtedness  is 

impossible. Therefore, the players who reach 

 cannot lose more money. If they are selected to 

0=is

play and they lose, they stay with no money, if they win, they get the fixed amount of money from 

the loser. On the contrary, in the OPIP, very poor agents always lose only a fraction of they money, 

and  they  never  reach  the  situation 

0=is

.  For  this  process,  using  standard  tools  of  Markov  chain 

theory  (as  described  in  [17],  [18],  [19],  and  [10]),  it  is  possible  to  prove  that  the  stationary 

distribution is given by:

and that this parameter plays the role of an effective inverse temperature ([20]), whereas 

the size S is analogous to the internal energy in a gas of N particles. 

Recently, these models have been critically reviewed in [21]. One of the main criticisms is that they 

do not take into account the free choice of economic agents to take part in the exchange. Even so, 

these models are very simple and, yet, they show that in the presence of finite and fixed resources, 

random allocation is enough to lead to inequality. It is, perhaps, not surprising that non-specialized 

media  emphasized  results  based  on  modifications  of  these  models,  after  a  conference  in  Kolkata 

[22]. 

 

3. Variations on the theme of proportional effects 

 

A very simple non-conservative model that takes into account the ideas of Gibrat is the following: 

(
ts
i

)
h=+1

( )tst
( )

i

, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  (8) 

where h is  a  random  variable  always  extracted  from  the  same  probability  distribution  ([23],  [24]  

and  [25]).  In  this  model,  there  is  no  interaction  between  the  agents,  and  the  subscript  i  can  be 

removed from  equation (8). Even  in  the  absence  of  interactions,  the  random  multiplicative  model 

gives rise to an interesting behaviour. Let us define the log-size as 

( )
tx

log=

(

)ts
( )

 and the growth 

rate as

x log=

h

.  Then the  log-size  at period t  is the sum of  the  initial  log-size and  of a series  of 

independent, identically distributed random variables:

  (9) 

If the growth rate is independent from the size, the Central Limit Theorem and its generalizations 

apply  in  the  large  t  limit  [26]  and  one  gets  either  normal  or  Lévy  distributed  log-sizes  and, 

therefore, lognormal or log-Lévy distributed sizes. Essentially, if the distribution of x has a finite 

second moment, the limiting distribution of s is lognormal otherwise it is log-Lévy. It is interesting 

to remark that this model gives rise to a diffusive (in the normal case) or sub-diffusive (in the Lévy 

regime) behaviour. Therefore there is no stationary probability density function and, starting from a 

situation  in  which  all  the  agents  are  characterized  by  the  same  size,  the  width  of  the  probability 

density function increases as a function of time. Solomon, in [27], shows that, in the normal case, 

for  large  times  the  probability  density,

,  of  finding  a  log-size  x  at  time  t  is  inversely

(

and the x dependence is washed out. This means that, in this regime, a power law with exponent 1 

approximately gives the probability density of size: 

proportional to the square root of t:

It is now useful to consider two continuous-time extensions of equations (8) and (9). The first one is 

as  follows.  Let  us  replace  in  equation  (8)  1  with  a  finite  but  small  time  interval,

For  the  second  extension,  let  us  consider  a  situation  in  which  the  growth  shocks  can  arrive  at 

where M(t) is the random number of shocks (growth events) that occurred from time 0 up to time t. 

Therefore,  this  extension  to  continuous  time  leads  to  pure-jump  stochastic  models  known  as 

continuous-time  random  walks  ([9]  and  [11]).  The  discrete-time  results  can  be  generalized  to 

continuous time. Again, as in the discrete case, if the growth shocks are independent from the size, 

the  Central  Limit  Theorem  and  its  generalizations  apply  in  the  diffusive  limit  ([9],  [11])  and  one 

gets either normal or Lévy distributed log-sizes and, therefore, log-normal or log-Lévy distributed 

sizes.  It  is  important  to  remark  that,  as  in  the  discrete  case,  there  is  no  statistical  equilibrium 

probability density, as the width of p(x,t) continuously increases with time.

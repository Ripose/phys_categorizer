Abstract
The transverse current profile in the Next Linear Collider
Test Accelerator (NLCTA) electron beam can be monitored
at  several  locations  along  the  beam  line  by  means  of
profile  monitors.    These  consist  of  insertable  phosphor
screens,  light  collection  and  transport  systems,  CID
cameras, a frame-grabber, and PC and VAX based image
analysis software. In addition to their usefulness in tuning
and  steering  the  accelerator,  the  profile  monitors  are
utilized for emittance measurement.  A description of these
systems and their performance is presented.

I.    INTRODUCTION

Among  the  devices  which  comprise  the  beam
instrumentation system of the Next Linear Collider Test
Accelerator [1] at SLAC are eight beam profile monitors:
one near the gun, one between the injector sections, one
each before, in the middle of, and after the chicane, one
after  the  main  accelerator,  and  one  at  each  of  the  two
dumps.    Along  with  four  wire  scanners,  these  profile
monitors  allow  us  to  view  the  transverse  charge
distribution  of  the  electron  beam  at  various  positions
along  the  beam  line.    They  are  of  great  utility  for
monitoring  beam  shape,  verifying  transmission,  and,  in
the high dispersion region of the chicane and spectrometer,
measuring energy spread in the long bunch train [2],[3].
In addition, they are employed in data acquisition for beam
emittance and TWISS parameter measurement.

The screens used in our profile monitors are of the
same type used in the SLC [4].  They are fabricated from
aluminum, to which is bound a fine-grained surface layer
of  Gd O S : Tb
.    This  coating  phosphoresces  with  a
decay  time  of  about  a  millisecond  where  the  incident
electron beam deposits energy.  The light emitted per unit
area  is  proportional  to  the  charge  passing  through  the
screen.    They  are  supported  on  pneumatic  vacuum
feedthroughs which allow them to be retracted from the
beam pipe volume when not in use.

When a screen is inserted, its surface makes an angle
of    45o with the beam line axis so that it can be viewed
through a vertical view port.  A pattern of holes drilled in
the screen allows for image dimensions to be calibrated.
For most screens, this is a rectangular frame with seven
holes horizontally and five vertically.  The horizontal and
projected vertical hole spacing is 1.5 mm.  The last three

profile monitors have larger screens with a different hole
pattern.

III.    OPTICS

An optical system is employed to distance the camera
from  the  high  radiation  levels  produced  by  the  beam,
particularly when incident on the screen.  The layout of
our  optical  elements  is  illustrated  in  Figure  1.    They
include three flat optical mirrors, an adjustable iris, and a
three-inch, 350 mm focal length imaging lens.  The image
magnification is set close to unity to minimize aberration.
The camera is placed a couple of feet off to the side of and
below the beamline and is shielded by an enclosure of lead
bricks supported by a steel frame.  The amount of light
entering  the  camera  is  adjusted  by  means  of  a  remotely
controlled  motor  connected  to  the  iris.    Also  remotely
controllable is a lamp aimed through a second window in
the  vacuum  chamber.    This  allows  us  to  illuminate  the
screen in order to view the hole pattern and calibrate the x
and y scales of the received image.  Illumination is also
needed while manually aligning the optical elements and
focusing the image.

IV.    CAMERA

The  camera  used  in  our  profile  monitors  is  the
CID2250D  manufactured  by  CIDTEC,  a  30  Hz,  solid
state, CID (charge injection device), monochrome video
camera.  The designation “CID” refers to the fact that after

each frame is read out from the sensor, the charge on its
MOS capacitor array is injected into a substrate.  It is rated
for  fifty  times  longer  life  than  CCD  (charge  coupled
device) cameras in an ionizing radiation environment and
is much more "neutron-hard".  The sensor is a 59 square
millimeter surface containing 512 × 512  pixel  capacitors
with 0.015 mm spacing.  Its sensitivity and range can be
adjusted by setting the gain and offset voltage.

The camera is fitted with a close-up zoom lens which
is focused on the screen image formed several centimeters
away.    A  long,  special  cable  connects  the  palm-sized
camera body to a camera control unit (CCU) outside of the
shielded accelerator housing.

V.    FRAME-GRABBER  /  TIMING  SIGNALS

Each of the eight CCU's is connected via two coaxial
cables through a multiplexer and some electronics into a
frame-grabber in the NLCTA control room.  For the latter
we employ Data Translation's Fidelity 200 Flexible Frame
Processor board installed in an Industrial Computer Source
90  MHz  PC.    Figure  2  shows  a  diagram  of  our  profile
monitor signal processing system.

Figure 2.  Timing signal electronics.

The frame-grabber operates on three timing signals:
pixel  clock,  end-of-line,  and  end-of-frame.    Using  the
board's internal oscillator for the pixel clock was found to
eliminate a line-to-line image jitter problem.  The end-of-
line signal, output by the camera control units, is brought
in through one of the coax cables.  The other cable carries
the raw video signal.  To avoid stringing more cables than
necessary, and because our multiplexer only switches two
signals, we worked out a way to run without bringing the
CCU's end-of-frame (EOF) signal into the frame-grabber,
as described below.

A third coax cable, daisy chained to all of the CCU's
from the control room, carries to them a 30 Hz frame-reset
signal  to  synchronize  the  cameras  with  the  accelerator
timing system.  The CCU's output end-of-frame signal is
locked to its first end-of-line pulse after the leading edge of
the frame reset.  We can produce the same signal in the
control room by combining the frame reset and incoming

end-of-line signals in a NIM logic unit.  This process is
illustrated  in  Figure  3.    A  time  delay  reflectometer  was
used to determine the round-trip travel time between the
control room and the CCU, so that the delayed frame reset
pulse  would  select  the  proper  end-of-line  pulse.    The
necessary  components  are  shown  in  light  gray  in  the
diagram of Figure 2.

The  cameras  must  operate  at  30  Hz.    However,  in
NLCTA operation, the beam repetition rate is generally 10
Hz.  The resulting strobe effect in the video image can be
annoying  and  gives  one  only  a  one  third  probability  of
capturing  a  beam  image  on  each  try.    The  following
procedure was therefore incorporated.  We take a 10 Hz
trigger identical to that driving the electron gun from the
same PDU (Programmable Delay Unit) that gives us our
30 Hz trigger.  We expand this with a gate generator and
combine  it  in  a  logic  unit  with  our  constructed  end-of-
frame signal.  Since the latter has been slightly delayed,
the  effect  is  to  pass  every  third  end-of-frame  pulse,  as
illustrated in Figure 4.  When the frame-grabber is then
given this signal and told to expect 10 Hz video, this is all
that it digitizes, despite the fact that the camera is sending
thirty  frames  per  second.    This  is  accomplished  by  the
unshaded components in Figure 2.

VI.    SOFTWARE

In conjunction with the Fidelity 200 frame-grabber
card,  we  use  Data  Translation’s  GLOBAL  LAB  Image

software, running in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups.
This  image  processing  and  analysis  package  has  many
features.  It configures the frame-grabber for our camera
model.  It displays live video or captures single frames,
which  can  be  saved  as  TIFF  format  image  files.    It  can
plot the pixel values along any slice of an image selected
by  dragging  a  line.    It  also  allows  the  user  to  program
scripts to perform desired sequences of operations.

Unfortunately, GLOBAL LAB Image seems not to
have  been  designed  with  beam  physicists  in  mind.    It
cannot  readily  do  such  things  as  projections,  curve  fits,
and  contour  plots.    One  can  expand  its  capabilities  by
writing additional C-code.  However, for our purposes, it
was preferable to FTP beam images to the SLC VAX and
analyze  them  there,  when  desired,  with  our  own  code
written  in  MATLAB.    This  code  subtracts  the  baseline
from the image array, displays 2-D contour plots, projects
the pixel values onto the x and/or y axis, and fits gaussian
curves to determine the beam sigmas.  An example beam
spot  is  shown  in  Figure  5.    Its  projections,  along  with
gaussian fits, are shown in Figure 6.

then reads in the quadrupole name and field values from the
CORRELATIONS  PLOT  output  and  gets  the  tranfer
matrix  between  the  quadrupole  and  the  profile  monitor
from the online database, as well as the beam energy.  A
parabola  is  fit  to  a  plot  of  σ
2  vs. quadrupole strength.

VII.    EMITTANCE  MEASUREMENT
The beam physics program of the NLCTA makes it
desireable to be able to measure the beam emittance, as
well as how well matched the beam is to the lattice.  This
is  done  with  our  profile  monitors  using  to  the  general
procedure described by Ross, et al.  [5].

To  measure  horizontal  beam  phase  space,  for
example,  the  CORRELATIONS  PLOT  program  in  our
controls software is used to step a horizontally focusing
quadrupole  magnet    upstream  of  the  chosen  profile
monitor through seven field strengths about the nominal
value.  At each step, a trigger is sent to our frame-grabber,
and GLOBAL LAB Image stores the beam image to disk.

These images are then transfered from PC to VAX,
and  their  gaussian  spacial  distribution  sigmas  in  the
relevant dimension are determined.  These are related to the

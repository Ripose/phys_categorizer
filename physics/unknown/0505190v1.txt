Abstract. Handling substance-like physical quantities in the limits of special relativity 
theory we should make a net distinction between those which present a proper (rest) 
magnitude and those which have not. We show how the theory relates them via 
relativistic transformation equations. 
 
1. Introduction 
Among the many physical quantities with which physicists operate we find certain class 
of  physical  quantities  which  play  fundamental  roles  in  classical  and  modern  physics  as 
well.  They  are  called  substance-like  physical  quantities  and  include:  mass,  energy, 
momentum, electric charge and particle number density (amount of substance). Let A be 
the  amount  of  such  a  substance-like  physical  quantity.  They  share  in  common  the 
following properties: 
-They are confined in bodies (in physical systems) and flow through space,         
-Theirs distribution in a volume V is characterized by a spatial density 

 given by 

 

or 
 

 

 

 

 

-Theirs flow through a given surface is characterized by the current density 
 
u representing the velocity at which the flow takes place and by the current IA  given by

S representing the surface through which the flow takes place, 1n the unit normal vector 
at a given point of the surface S  
-They obey the continuity equation 

which shows that the speed of change of A located inside a given volume is due to a flow 
of A through its boundary surface (IA) and to a production or destruction of A within the 
considered region of space (

).

mass (m), energy (E), particle number density (n) and spatial density (
proper magnitude (
) measured by observers relative to whom the substance-
like  substance  is  confined  is  in  a  state  of  rest.  Electric  charge  q  has  a  special  status 
because  its  magnitude  is  the  same  for  all  inertial  observers  in  relative  motion.  For 
momentum, current density and current no proper values can be defined.  
 
The  involved  inertial  reference  frames  are  K(XYZO)  and  K”(X’Y’Z’O’).  The 
axes of the two frames are parallel to each other and the OX(O’X’) axes are overlapped. 
K’ moves with constant velocity v relative to K in the positive direction of the overlapped 
axes. At the common origin of time in the two frames, the origins O and O’ are shortly 
located at the same point in space. In order to keep the problem as simple as possible, we 
consider  that  the  body  in  which  substance-like  physical  quantities  are  confined  moves 
with constant velocity 
 relative to K’. In accordance 
with the transformation of relativistic velocity we have

Physicists  are  experienced  godfathers  when  they  find  out  names  for  the  physical 
quantities  with  which  they  operate.  As  long  as  they  find  out  names  for  basic  physical 
quantities  used  in  order  to  construct  a  system  of  units  (length,  time,  mass,  Kelvin 
temperature and electric charge (no electric current) no special problems appear. Names 
given  to  physical  quantities  defined  as  a  combination  of  some  basic  physical  quantities 
generate fierce debates. Introducing the notations 

physicists call m and m’ relativistic (dynamic) mass measured by observers from K and

As  we  see,  special  relativity  theory  relates  two  substance-like  physical  quantities  for 
which we can define a proper value (mass) and for which such a concept is meaningless 
(momentum).  
Considering a simple collision process between two particles from K and K’ and 
 
working  with  the  transformation  equations  for  mass  (energy)  and  momentum  derived 
above  we  can  show  that  relativistic  mass  (energy)  and  relativistic  momentum  lead  to 
results  in  accordance  with  the  conservation  laws  for  mass  (energy)  and  momentum  as

Relations  (25)  and  (26)  show  how  special  relativity  relates  a  physical  quantity  with 
proper value (
The situation becomes simpler in the case of the substance like physical quantity electric 
charge q that as we have mentioned above is a relativistic invariant. Its spatial density is

in K’ resulting that it transforms as

We define the proper particle number density (amount of substance) as 

 

 

where the counted number of stable particles N is a relativistic invariant. The experience 
gained so far tell us that n and n’ measured in K and in K’ respectively transform as 

Using (31) we can recover some of the transformation equations derived above. 
 
It is interesting to mention that we can define substance-like physical quantities in 
empty  space  as  well.  Consider  that  there  is  a  region  in  empty  space  where  we  have  an 
uniform electric field intensity showing in the positive direction of the O0Y0 axis

and without proper values lead to invariant expressions that hold in all inertial reference 
frames. 
3. Conclusions 
 
 
We  have  shown  that  handling  substance-like  physical  quantities  in  the  limits  of 
special  relativity  theory  we  should  make  a  net  distinction  between  those  that  have  a 
proper  amount  and  those  that  have  not.  Special  relativity  reveals  the  way  in  which 
transformation  equations  relate  mass  (energy)  and  momentum  and  volume  density  to 
current density.

I. INTRODUCTION 

The  utilization  of  L2  methods  to  carry  out  scattering  calculation  underwent 
several major developments starting with the stabilization technique of Hazi and Taylor 
[1].  Then  followed  by  the  development  of  the  L2-Fredholm  method  [2]  in  which 
scattering  information  is  extracted  from  the  discrete  eigenvalues  of  the  scattering 
Hamiltonian,  { } 1
,  in  a  finite  L2-
basis,  {
 
.  This  method  is  analogous  to  discretizing  the  continuous  spectrum  of 
the  system  by  confining  it  to  a  box  in  configuration  space.  Although  the  approximate 
Fredholm determinant,

  can  be  fitted  to  a  low  order 
continued  fraction  and  then  analytically  continued  to  the  real  energy  axis  with  the 
resulting phase identified as the negative of the scattering phase shift. 
 
Subsequent  development  was  based  on  the  realization  that  for  certain  L2  bases 
 
the approximation (1.1) may be interpreted as a quadrature approximation to the known 
dispersion equation relating the Fredholm determinant to its imaginary part, A(E), as

Heller  and  Yamani  [4]  then  realized  that  in  some  complete  Laguerre  and 
 
Oscillator  bases  of  L2  function  space  it  was  not  necessary  to  confine  the  reference 
Hamiltonian, H0, to a finite matrix representation as is done to the short range scattering 
potential.  This  is  because  these  special  bases  allow  a  full  algebraic  solution  to  the  H0(cid:150)
problem.  This  basic  concept  of  the  J-matrix  method  [4-6]  endowed  the  method  with 
both  formal  and  computational  similarities  to  the  R-matrix  method  [7].  The  J-matrix 
method  yields  exact  scattering  information  over  a  continuous  range  of  energy  for  a 
model  potential  obtained  by  truncating the given short-range potential in a finite subset 
of  this  basis.  It  was  shown  to  be  free  from  fictitious  resonances  that  plague  some 
algebraic  variational  scattering  methods  [8].  The  method  has  been  applied  successfully 
to  a  large  number  of  non-relativistic  problems  and  has  been  extended  to  multi-channel 
[9,10] as well as relativistic [11,12] scattering. The accuracy and convergence property 
of  the  method  compares  favorably  with  other  successful  scattering  calculation  methods 
[13].  Attempts  have  been  made  to  account  for  the  class  of  all  Hamiltonians  that  are 
compatible  with  the  J-matrix  formalism  [14].  Beside  the  familiar  Coulomb,  oscillator, 
and  S-wave  Morse  potentials  very  few  other  potentials  were  added  to  this  class  which 
included  some  interesting  potentials  at  zero  energy.  It  turns  out  that  SO(2,1)  is  an 
underlying  symmetry  of  the  theory  [14,15]  which,  of  course,  restricts  the  scope  of 
application  of  the  method  to  physical  problems  with  only  this  dynamical  symmetry 
group. Not only the kind of reference Hamiltonians is restricted but so is the choice of a 
convenient basis. To start with, one has to find a basis in which the representation of the 
Schr(cid:246)dinger (wave) operator of the unperturbed problem is tridiagonal. This meant that 
both the matrix representation of the reference Hamiltonian and the basis-overlap matrix 
must be at most tridiagonal. Thereafter, one has to solve the resulting recursion relation 
to  obtain  the  required  asymptotic  expansion  coefficients  of  the  regularized  wave 
function.  In  some  instances,  even  if  it  was  possible  to arrive at the required tridiagonal 
representation,  the  resulting  recursion  relation  may  turn  out  to  be  too difficult to solve 
analytically.  This  is  for  example  the  case  in  the  relativistic  Dirac-Coulomb  problem 
[12]. 
 
 
Although  the  J-matrix  method  found  applications  in  atomic  and  nuclear 
scattering,  and  its  results  compared  favorably  with other methods, it was not as widely 
used  as  other  methods  such  as  the  R-matrix.  One  reason  is  that  the  method  required 
some knowledge of more mathematical functions than that of other methods. But more 
importantly,  the  J-matrix  method  was  restrictive  in  the  use  of  the  L2  bases  to  some 
special  bases  sets  in  which  the  H0(cid:150)problem  is  analytically  soluble.  Other  L2  bases  exist 
that are sometimes more useful than the J-matrix bases. 
 

In  this  paper  we  lift  the  restriction  imposed  on  the  method  of  using  specific  L2 
bases. We show that any given complete set of L2 bases, {
 
, can be fitted into the 
J-matrix  method  without  compromising  any  of  the  advantages  that  it  offers.  Since  the 
tridiagonal  matrix  representation  of  H0  is  basic  to  the  analytic  structure  of  the  theory, 
then even if the given representation in the conveniently chosen basis is not tridiagonal, 
we  can  still  use  numerical  routines  (e.g.  the  well-known  Householder  method)  to 
tridiagonalize it [16]. The problem is, therefore, transformed back into the framework of 
the J-matrix method enabling the use of the usual computational tools of the formalism. 
The  tridiagonalization  routines  also  produce  an  orthogonal  transformation  matrix  that 
performs  the  change  to  the  new  basis  in  which  H0  is  tridiagonal.  Since  all  kinematic 
information is in H0, which is not altered by the unitary transformation, then we should

expect that the diagonal and off-diagonal entries in the resulting tridiagonal matrix carry 
this  information.  Specifically,  we  expect  that  these  entries  are  all  that  is  required  to 
compute  the  J-matrix  kinematical  coefficients  needed  for  the  calculation  of  the  S-
matrix.  We  have  already  developed  a  numerical  scheme  based  on  this  technique.  It 
utilizes  the  continued  fraction  representation  of  the  J-matrix  objects  in  terms  of  the 
entries  of  the  tridiagonal  matrices.  However,  due  to  numerical  rounding  errors 
associated  with  tridiagonalization  reduction  routines  for  matrices  in  some  bases,  the 
accuracy of the algorithm may be compromised [16,17]. Therefore, we propose here an 
alternative scheme. 

 
The  proposed  scheme  similarly  does  not  require  a tridiagonal representation for 
the  reference  Hamiltonian  or  the  basis  overlap  matrix  in  the  given  L2  basis.  It  projects 
the  J-matrix  formalism  in  terms  of  the  eigenvalues  and  eigenvectors  of  these  matrices 
and  their  submatrices  rather  than  the  elements  of  their  tridiagonal  representations. 
Therefore,  no  explicit  reference  is  made  to  the  tridiagonal  structure  of  the  theory.  In 
fact,  the  scheme  solves  the  recursion  relation  indirectly  giving  the  J-matrix  kinematical 
coefficients  needed  for  the  calculation  of  the  S-matrix.  This  has  at  least  three  major 
advantages.  First,  it  opens  the  door  to  a  wider  range  of  physical  problems  beyond  the 
restrictive  SO(2,1)  symmetry.  Second,  it  gives  the  freedom  of  choice  for  any  suitable 
and  convenient  basis  without  the  constraint  of  a  tridiagonal  representation  neither  for 
the reference Hamiltonian nor for the basis-overlap matrix. Third, it eliminates the need 
for  recursive calculations associated with recursion relations, which are usually plagued 
with  numerical  instabilities.  Most  importantly,  this  numerical  scheme  can  be  applied  to 
non-relativistic  as  well  as  relativistic  scattering  problems  as  demonstrated  in  one of the 
examples. The foundation of the proposed scheme is based on the theory of orthogonal 
polynomials associated with tridiagonal matrices.  
 

The paper is organized as follows: In section II we identify the quantities needed 
as  computational  tools  in  the  J-matrix  formalism.  In  section  III  we  describe  how  to 
calculate  these  J-matrix  quantities  without  reference  to  the  recursion  relation  or  to  the 
tridiagonal  representations.  We  also  outline  the  steps  of  the  numerical  algorithm  for 
computing the S-matrix. In section IV we demonstrate the utility, accuracy, and ease of 
the  proposed  numerical  algorithm  by  applying  it  to  some  examples  and  compare  that 
with  known  analytic  results.  In  the  Appendix,  we  give  the  necessary  modifications  to 
the scheme in the case of non-orthogonal basis.

Had  the  reference  Hamiltonian(cid:146)s  representation  been  tridiagonal,  it  would  have

We  apply  the  numerical  algorithm  developed  in  the  previous  section  to  four 
,  but  for  different 
examples  with  the  same  type  of  short-range  potential, 
reference  Hamiltonians  and  bases.  The  third  example  is  an  extension  of  the  scheme  to 
multi-channel  scattering.  The  fourth  example  is  a  relativistic  Coulomb  scattering  where 
the  calculation  is  done  in  the  non-relativistic  limit  so  that  we  can compare with known 
analytic  non-relativistic  J-matrix  results.  We  implemented  the  numerical  algorithm  by 
using  simple  computer  codes  written  in  Mathcad7.  These  codes  are  available  upon 
request directly from the authors.

is  not  associated  with  the  J-matrix  Coulomb  problem.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the 
representation  of  the  Coulomb potential Z/r in this basis is not tridiagonal. Historically, 
this  basis  was  used  with  a  reference  Hamiltonian  that  is  made  up  of  the  kinetic  energy 
only  without  any  other  analytic  potential  term.  It  was  shown,  however,  that  including 
2
the  oscillator  potential  ‰τ  r
  in  H0  preserves  the  tridiagonal  structure  in  this  oscillator 
basis  and  maintains  compatibility  with  the  J-matrix  formalism  [14,15].  Moreover,  it  is 
worthwhile  noting  that  this  type  of  basis  is  frequently  used  in  nuclear  physics,  which 
makes  the  numerical  J-matrix  scheme  proposed  here  a  good  candidate  for  nuclear 
scattering  calculations.  Anyhow,  for  the  present  problem,  the  matrix  representation  of 
the kinetic energy part of H0 is tridiagonal and well known [5]. We choose to calculate 
the  matrix  elements  of  the  Coulomb  potential  part  of  H0  in  this  basis  using  Gauss 
quadrature integral approximation [24]. The numerical scheme is applied with the same 
short range potential

The result is shown in Figure (3). It is to be compared with the analytic result calculated

The  numerical  scheme  is  easily  extendable  to  multi-channel  scattering  [9,10].  We 
consider  a  two-channel  scattering  using  the  orthogonal  oscillator  basis  for  a  reference 
Hamiltonian  having only the kinetic energy term and with threshold energies (in atomic 
units):

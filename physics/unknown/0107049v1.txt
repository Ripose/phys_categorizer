Abstract 

 
Recent experiments at SLAC [1,2] and CERN [3] have revealed evidence of significant deformation in the form of 
“pitting”  of  the  cells  of  the  1.8m  series  of  structures  DDS/RDDS  (Damped  Detuned  Structure/Rounded  Damped 
Detuned Structure).  This pitting occurs in the high group velocity (vg /c = 0.012) end of the accelerating structure 
and little evidence of breakdown has been found in the lower group velocity end of the structure.  Additional, albeit 
preliminary  experimental  evidence,  suggests  that  shorter  and  lower  group  velocity  structures  have  reduced 
breakdown  events  with  increasing  accelerating  field  strengths.    Two  designs  are  presented  here,  firstly  a  90cm 
structure  consisting  of  83  cells  with  an  initial  vg/c  =  0.0506  (known  as  H90VG5)  and  secondly,  an  even  shorter 
structure of length 60cm consisting of 55 cells with an initial vg /c = 0.03 (known as H60VG3).  The feasibility of 
using these structures to accelerate a charged beam over 10km is investigated.   The particular issue focussed upon 
is suppression of the dipole wakefields via detuning of the cell frequencies and by locally damping individual cells 
in  order  to  avoid  BBU  (Beam  Break  Up).    Results  are  presented  on  beam-induced  dipole  wakefields  and  on  the 
beam dynamics encountered on tracking the progress of the beam through several thousand accelerating structures.

Abstract 
Recent  experiments  at  SLAC  [1,2]  and  CERN  [3]  have 
revealed  evidence  of  significant  deformation  in  the  form 
of  “pitting”  of  the  cells  of  the  1.8m  series  of  structures 
DDS/RDDS 
(Damped  Detuned  Structure/Rounded 
Damped  Detuned  Structure).    This  pitting  occurs  in  the 
high group velocity (vg /c = 0.012) end of the accelerating 
structure and little evidence of breakdown has been found 
in  the  lower  group  velocity  end  of  the  structure.  
Additional,  albeit  preliminary  experimental  evidence, 
suggests  that  shorter  and  lower  group  velocity  structures 
increasing 
have 
accelerating  field  strengths.    Two  designs  are  presented 
here,  firstly  a  90cm  structure  consisting  of  83  cells  with 
an  initial  vg/c  =  0.0506  (known  as  H90VG5)  and 
secondly,  an  even  shorter  structure  of  length  60cm 
consisting of 55 cells with an initial vg /c = 0.03 (known 
as H60VG3).  The feasibility of using these structures to 
accelerate  a  charged  beam  over  10km  is  investigated.   
The  particular  issue  focussed  upon  is  suppression  of  the 
dipole wakefields via detuning of the cell frequencies and 
by locally damping individual cells in order to avoid BBU 
(Beam  Break  Up).    Results  are  presented  on  beam-
induced  dipole  wakefields  and  on  the  beam  dynamics 
encountered on tracking the progress of the beam through 
several thousand accelerating structures. 

1. INTRODUCTION 
Recent  experimental  results  have  revealed  significant 
damage  to  the  cells  of 
the  DDS/RDDS  series  of 
accelerating structures due to RF breakdown occurring.  A 
concerted  both  theoretical  and  experimental  effort  has 
been  mounted  at  SLAC  and  KEK  in  order  to  understand 
why  it  occurs  in  our  particular  structures  and  to  prevent 
electrical breakdown occurring in further structures.   

Application  of  a  simple  circuit  model  [4]  allows  an 
understanding of the basic processes that may be involved 
in  the  breakdown  and  this  has  been  applied  to  our 
travelling wave structures to obtain the power absorbed in 
the breakdown [5] (modelled as a single resistor, RA at a 
localised cell): 

 

where the accelerating  mode parameters are given by:  vg 
is the group velocity, φ is the synchronous phase advance 
(=5π/6),  grad  the  accelerating  gradient,  and  R  and  Q  are 
the  shunt  impedance  and  quality  factor  evaluated  at  the 
synchronous  phase.    This  model  implies  a  quadratic 
dependence  on  the  group  velocity  and  thus  reducing  the 
group  velocity  will  enable  the  power  absorbed  to  be 
reduced.    Reducing  the  average  iris  radius  reduces  the 
group  velocity  but  at  the  same  time  the  short  range 
transverse  wakefield  is  increased  and  in  order  to  prevent 
this  from  occurring  we  increased  the  synchronous  phase 
from  2π/3  to  5π/6.    The  new  high  phase  advance 
structures maintain the same ratio of average iris radius to 
free  space  wavelength  (=  a/λ  =  0.18)  but  with  a  reduced 
group  velocity.    The  RDDS  series  had  an  intial  group 
velocity of 12% of the velocity of light, whereas the latest 
series of structures have initial group velocities of 3% and 
5% of the velocity of light and in order to investigate the 
occurrence of breakdown as a function of structure length 
90cm  and  60cm  structures  are  about  to  be  fabricated 
incorporating  detuning  of  the  dipole  frequencies  of  the 
cells.   

Here,  we  examine  the  long  range  wakefield  for  two 
structures  in  which  we  prescribe  an  error  function 
variation on the synchronous frequency of each individual 
cell  and  provide  local  damping  of  each  cell  with  a  Q 
~1000.    The  results  of  such  local  damping  are  shown  in 
the  following  section  together  with  interleaving  of  the  
structure frequencies. 

2. WAKE FUNCTION CALCULATION 
We  utilize  a  two-band  equivalent  circuit  model  [6]  in 
order to analyse the dispersion characteristics of the first 
two dipole bands.  The computer code Ω2D [7] is used to 
obtain  the  zero  and  π  modes  and  the  circuit  model 
provides all remaining points.  The model described in [6] 
is  a  little  different  from  what  is  required  and  we  remove 
the  manifold  and  insert  a  resistor  in  series  with  the 
capacitances in order to model local damping, the subject 
of  this  paper.    The  wake  function  is  obtained  from  the 
inverse  Fourier  transform  of  the  spectrum  function  [8].  
We apply this method to obtain the spectrum function and 
wake function for H90VG5 and H60VG3 with a cell Q of 
1000 and the results are shown in fig 1 and 2 respectively.

Earlier beam dynamics simulations have indicated that the 
wake  field  at  the  bunch  locations  must  be  below 
1V/pC/mm/m  in  order  that  BBU  not  occur.    Each  bunch 
(in  the  present  JLC/NLC  design)  is  spaced  from  its 
neighbour by 42cm and it is clear from fig. 2 that there are 
many  positions  in  which  the  wakefield  is  greater  than  1 
V/pC/mm/m.    Thus,  either  heavy  Q  loading  must  be 
utilized  to  damp  down  the  wakefield  or  the  dipole 
frequencies of one particular structure must be interleaved 
with those from other structures.  We adopt this method of 
interleaving  for  H90VG5  in  which  we  take  the  original 
error  function  distribution 
the  cell  synchronous 
frequencies  and  double  the  number  of  frequencies  in  the 
given  distribution,  picking  the  odd  values  for  one 
structure  and  the  even  values  for  the  neighbouring 
accelerating  structure  and  from  this  we  end  up  with  2 
structures  on  a  girder  (of  total  length  1.8m).    A  similar 
technique is applied to H60VG3.  The interleaved spectral 
function  for  H90VG5  is  significantly  improved  from  a 
single  structure. 
the  wakefield  for  an 
interleaved version H60VG3 shows superior damping and 
it easily meets the beam dynamics requirements. 

  However,

3. BEAM DYNAMICS 
The  sum  wakefield    (defined  at  a  particular  bunch  as 
the  sum  of  the  wakefield  from  all  the  bunches  ahead  of 
that bunch) provides a measure as to whether or not BBU 
will  occur  along  the  linac.    BBU  is  indeed  a  complex 
phenomena but through extensive tracking simulations we 
have  found  that,  provided  the  standard  deviation  of  the  
sum  wakefield  from  the  mean  value  (Sσ)  is  less  than  1 
V/pC/mm/m then BBU will not occur.  In fig 3 Sσ has

been  calculated  for  the  both  interleaved  structures  as  a 
function of a small fractional change in the bunch spacing 
(∆sb,  corresponding  to  a  systematic  error  in  the  cell 
frequencies).   H60VG3 clearly remains  well below  unity 
and  tracking  the  beam  (initially  offset  by  1µm)  through 
5,000  or  more  structures  (shown  in  fig  4)  indicates  that

with  three-fold  interleaving  (maximum  of  Sσ  =  0.69  at  a 
0.31% reduction in the nominal bunch spacing)  
 
The  two-fold  interleaved  version  of  H90VG5  does  not 
show  a  significant  emittance  dilution  unless  we  take  the 
worst-case value of ∆sb =  -0.293% and Sσ =1.26 then we 
find that BBU does indeed occur (see  fig 5 in  which the 
emittance  has  grown  by  80%).    However,  in  practice  the 
systematic  error  is  unlikely  to  be  unaccompanied  by 
random  errors  in  the  cell  frequencies  from  structure  to 
structure and these have been shown to  minimise stop to 
reduce  the  effective  wakefield  and  to  stop  BBU  from 
occurring [9].

the  beam

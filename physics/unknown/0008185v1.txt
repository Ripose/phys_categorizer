Abstract 

A  test  of  the  acceleration  of  multiple  charge-state 
uranium beams was performed at the ATLAS accelerator. 
A 238U+26 beam was accelerated in the ATLAS PII linac to 
286  MeV  (~1.2  MeV/u)  and  stripped  in  a  carbon  foil 
located  0.5  m  from  the  entrance  of  the  ATLAS  Booster 
section.  A  58Ni9+  'guide'  beam  from  the  tandem  injector 
was used to tune the Booster for  238U+38. All charge states 
from  the  stripping  were  injected  into  the  booster  and 
accelerated.  Up  to  94%  of  the  beam  was  accelerated 
through the Booster linac, with losses mostly in the lower 
charge  states.    The  measured  beam  properties  of  each 
charge  state  and  a  comparison  to  numerical  simulations 
are reported in this paper.  

1 INTRODUCTION 

Simultaneous  acceleration  of  multiple  charge-state 
beams  has  been  proposed  as  a  method  of  substantially 
increasing the available beam current for the heaviest ions 
from  a  RIA  (Rare  Isotope  Accelerator)  driver  linac  [1]. 
There is presently no facility where multiple charge-state 
beam  acceleration  is  used  to  increase  the  beam  current. 
Therefore, in order to demonstrate the concept, we have 
accelerated  a  multiple  charge-state  uranium  beam  in  the 
existing  ATLAS  heavy-ion  linac,  and  performed  careful 
measurements  of  the  accelerated  beam  parameters  for 
comparison with the results of numerical simulations.  

The  acceleration  of  multiple  charge-state  uranium 
beams has been observed at the ATLAS ‚Äòbooster‚Äô as part 
of  the  ‚Äònormal‚Äô  uranium  beam  configuration.  However, 
the multiple charge states have been considered parasitic.  
Therefore systematic studies of all the accelerated charge 
states  were  not  performed  and  accelerator  parameters 
were not chosen to optimize the acceleration of the other 
charge states.   

In this test, a  238U+26 beam was accelerated to 286 MeV 
(~1.2 MeV/u) and stripped.  All charge states near q0=38 
were  then  simultaneously  accelerated  in  the  ATLAS 
‚ÄòBooster‚Äô  linac.  The  parameters  of  each  selected  charge 
state were carefully measured. 

parameters  were  assumed  to  be  the  same  for  all  charge 
states.  The  beam  longitudinal  and  transverse  emittances 
were taken to be equal to 0L=2 5bkeV/ubnsec and 0T=0.25 
5bmmbmrad.  The  ray-tracing  code  incorporated  actual 
resonator 
the 
superconducting  cavities.  The  synchronous  phase  for 
238U+38 was set to -30G.  Fig. 1 and 2 show the calculated 
longitudinal  phase  space  at  the  booster  exit  and  the 
transverse beam envelopes along the Booster.

state uranium beam along the booster. 

 
As is seen one can expect acceleration of most charge 
states produced after the stripping foil. The simulation of 
the transverse motion does not include the misalignment 
errors; and therefore the total effective emittance growth 
is negligible. 

2 BEAM DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS 
For  a  better  understanding  of  the  beam  test  results,  a 
multiple  charge-state  beam  dynamics  simulation  in  the 
Booster  was  performed  with  the  modified  LANA  code 
[2].  At  the  position  of  the  stripping  target,  input  beam 

3   DESCRIPTION OF THE EXPERIMENT 
The  238U+26  beam  from  the  ATLAS  ECR-II  ion  source 
was accelerated to 286 MeV (~1.2 MeV/u) in the Injector 
Linac,  and  stripped  in  a  75  2g/cm2  carbon  foil  0.5  m 
before the ‚ÄòBooster‚Äô linac as shown in Fig. 3.  The beam 

energy  was  carefully  measured  by  a  resonant  time-of-
flight (TOF) system [3]. The ATLAS Booster was tuned 
using  a  58Ni+9  ‚Äòguide‚Äô  beam  from  the  ATLAS  tandem 
injector  whose  velocity  was  matched  to  that  of  the 
stripped  238U+38  and  which  has  a  similar  charge-to-mass 
ratio.  The synchronous phase for 238U+38 was chosen to be 
‚Äì30G.    Therefore  the  synchronous  phase G  required  for 
the guide beam is given by [1]

The synchronous phase in all 24 cavities of the booster is 
set by an auto-scan procedure using a silicon detector for 
beam energy measurements. Tuning of the focusing fields 
to  get  100%  transmission  was  accomplished  with  the 
guide  beam  prior  to  switching  to  the  uranium  mixed 
beam.  

 
   

Figure 3: Layout of ATLAS linac. 

After  optimising  the  Booster  linac  and  40G-bend  tune 
with  the  58Ni+9  guide  beam,  the  stripped  uranium  beam 
was injected into the Booster.  Magnet slits were used to 
cleanly  select  only  the  38+  beam  after  the  bending 
magnets and the uranium injection phase was matched to 
the  guide  beam‚Äôs  phase  empirically  based  on  maximum 
transmission  through  the  system.    Further  tuning  of  the 
bunching  system  and  last  PII  resonator  made  small 
adjustments to the uranium beam energy to better match 
the  guide  beam‚Äôs  velocity.  After  this  tuning  process,  a 
91%  transmission  of  the  multiple  charge-state  uranium 
beam  was  achieved.  The  transmission  improved  to  94% 
when  a  10  mm  aperture  was  inserted  upstream  of  the 
stripping target. Fig. 4 compares the intensity distribution 
of  the  mixture  of  multiple  charge-state  uranium  beams 
accelerated  in  the  booster  to  the  measured  stripping 
distribution for the unaccelerated uranium. The difference 
in 
is  caused  mainly  by  poorer 
transmission  of  lower  charge  states  through  the  booster. 
Also,  some  discrepancy  is  expected  due  to  slightly 
different  tuning  of  unaccelerated  and  accelerated  beams 
and collimator slits in the 40G bend region. 
The individual charge states then were analysed in the 
40G bend region and sent to the ATLAS beam diagnostics 
area (see Fig. 3). The parameters of each selected charge 
state were carefully measured. Particularly the following 
beam parameters were measured:

Finally,  the  multi-charged  uranium beam was stripped 
for  the  second  time  at  the  exit of the Booster and  238U+51 
was  selected.  The  same  beam  parameters  measurements 
were performed and the beam was further accelerated in 
the last section of ATLAS. As expected, the use of multi-
charged  uranium  beam  on  the  second  stripper  increased 
the intensity of double-stripped  238U+51 beam. The double-
stripped 238U+51 was accelerated up to 1400 MeV and used 
for a scheduled experiment at ATLAS. 

Basic results of these beam measurements are shown in 
Fig. 5-8. Figure 5 presents transverse beam profiles at the 
exit  of  the  booster.  The  multiple  charge-state  uranium 
beam  has  a  larger  size  compared  to  the  guide  beam.  As 
was  shown  in  ref.  [1]  misalignments  of  the  focusing 
elements  and  effective  emittance  growth  of  a  multi-
charged beam compared to a single charge-state beam are 
the main source of the larger beam size. Such errors must 
be minimized in machines designed for the utilization of 
multi-charge  beams.  The  results  of  individual  transverse 
emittance measurements are presented   in   Table 1   and   
Figure 6.   The  horizontal

emittance  is  less  than  the  vertical  due  to  the  charge 
selection by the slits downstream of the bending magnet. 
Therefore only emittances in the vertical plane are shown. 
The  double-stripped  uranium  beam  238U+51  contains  all 
information  about  the  effective  emittance  of  multi-
charged  beam  output  of  the  Booster.  The  effective 
emittance 
increases  by  a  factor  of  2  due  to  the 
misalignment errors of the solenoids in the Booster. 

Average  energy  and  the  FWHM  energy  spread  of 
individual  charge  states  are  shown  in  Fig.  7.  For  the 
simulation  of  energy  spread,  the  input  longitudinal 
emittance  0L=25bkeV/ubnsec  was  assumed.  The  graphs 
show  consistent  behaviour  of  the  energy  spread  as  a 
function of charge state. There is some discrepancy with 
the average energy for the remote charge state which is, 
probably, caused by the longitudinal tuning errors of the 
SRF  cavities.  Certainly  such  tuning  in  high  intensity 
machines should  be  done  with high  precision,  but  for

routine operation of ATLAS it is not required. Even with 
these  tuning  errors,  the  average  energy  spread  for  three 
neighbouring  charge  states  37-39,  similar  to  the  beam 
energy  distribution  proposed  for the RIA driver linac, is 
only 0.7%. 

Figure  8  presents  bunch  time  width  measurements  of 
beams transported to the ATLAS diagnostic area. The left 
spectrum  corresponds  to  charge  state  38+  (before  the 
second  stripping)  and  the  right  spectrum  belongs  to 
double-stripped  uranium  beam  238U+51.  The  low  intensity 
background  events  are  mostly  due  to  detector  system 
background. The energy spectra at FWHM obtained from 
these  measurements  are  0.4%  for  charge  state  38+  and 
1.3% for charge state 51+. So, the second stripping of the 
multi-charged  beam  produced  a  3  times  larger  energy 
spread. 

CONCLUSION 

and 

this

The  results  of 

that  multi-charged 

test  are  consistent  with  the 
simulation 
beam 
acceleration  can  substantially  increase  the  intensity  of 
heavy-ion  beams.  A  medium-energy  high-power 
machine, such as the RIA driver linac, can be designed to 
utilize multi-Q beams if unwanted charge states after each 
stripping target are cleaned by a corresponding magnetic 
system. For low-intensity and low-energy linacs, such as 
ATLAS, the double-stripped heavy-ion beam can be used 
to  obtain  higher  beam  energy  while  providing  more 
intensity than with single charge-state acceleration.

Abstract 

Within the general frame of the upgrade of the collider 
DAφNE to the neutron-antineutron energy threshold (2–2.5 
GeV  c.m.),  modifications  and  different  options  for  the 
accelerator design are discussed and a possible lattice for 
the Main Rings at 1 GeV is presented. 

The luminosity required by the experiments for such a 
  cm-2  s-1, 

light  quark  factory  is  of  the  order  of  few  1031
easily achievable in the particle factory era. 

ENERGY UPGRADE 
OF THE FRASCATI FACTORY 
The experimental program of DAFNE2 (Double Annular 
Frascati e+e– factory for Nice Experiments at 2 GeV) can 
be  carried  out  with  the  FINUDA  detector  with  a  solenoid 
field of 0.3 T. 

Many  hardware  components  from  DAφNE  can  be  used 
for  DAFNE2  without  modifications:  the vacuum  chamber, 
all  the  electromagnetic  quadrupoles  and  sextupoles,  the 
RF  system,  the  feedback,  the diagnostic and the  vacuum 
systems. However eight new stronger bending dipoles per 
ring  and  four  superconducting  quadrupoles 
the 
experimental Interaction Region (IR2) are needed for the 
energy upgrade.

Concerning the injection, two options are possible: 
injection  off-energy  at  0.51  GeV  with  the  current 
system  (linac,  damping  ring  and  transfer  lines) 
performing the energy ramping in the Main Rings[1];

injection  directly  on-energy  (1–1.1  GeV)  adding  new 
accelerating structures to the linac [2]. In this case the 
damping ring is not used and some modification to the 
transfer lines  is  needed. 

Machine Parameters 

The  experimental  luminosity  requirements  are  not 
critical  for  DAFNE2.  This  allows  choosing  the  machine 
parameters  with  enough 
freedom,  exploiting  our 
commissioning  know-how.  We  have  worked  out  new 
parameters at beam collision energy of 1 GeV. 

Choosing  an  emittance  ε = 0.5·10-6  rad  m  compatible 
with  the  ring  aperture  and  a  vertical  beta  function  at  the 
Interaction  Point  (IP)  and  a  coupling  factor  already 
achieved (Table 1), the linear tune shift comes out ξx / ξy 
= 0.014 / 0.024, below the limit achieved by DAφNE. 

The horizontal crossing angle at the interaction point is 

±15 mrad, corresponding to a Piwinsky angle:

which has already been exceeded in the existing factories. 
The  chosen  number  of  bunches  is  30  so  that,  leaving 
the  harmonic  number  h  =  120  unchanged,  we  can  inject 
both electrons and positrons out of collision at 0.51 GeV 
and  collide  the  beams  by  performing  a  fast  RF  phase 
jump  [3]  as  the  beams  have  been  accelerated  to  the 
collision energy. 

In the on-energy injection option, injection in collision 
is  also  allowed  and  in  this  case  different  multibunch 
configurations can be used. 

Once  fixed such parameters (Table 1), a luminosity of 
1·1032  s-1  cm-2  is  straightforward  to  achieve  with  15  mA 
per bunch corresponding to a beam current of 0.45 A. 

MAIN RING DESIGN 
The design of the two Main Rings is unchanged (Figure 
1):  two  different  rings  for  positrons  and  electrons  with 
two  10  m  long  Interaction  Regions  where  the  opposite 
beams travel in the same vacuum chamber. Four wigglers 
per ring are installed in the arcs.  

The  experimental  detector  FINUDA  is  housed  in  the 
Interaction  Region  2  (IR2)  and  two  quadrupole  doublets 
are  installed  in  the  opposite  Interaction  Region  (IR1):  a 
lattice  already  used  before  2003  when  only  the  KLOE 
detector was installed [4]. 

New Dipoles 

Currently  eight  dipoles  are  installed  in  each  ring:  four 
0.99 m long magnets with a 40.5° bending angle (two are 
sector  type  and  two  rectangular)  and  four  1.21  m  long 
with a 49.5° angle (two sector and two rectangular). The 
bending field in the current dipoles at 0.51  GeV is 1.2 T 
and  the  maximum  field  they  can  reach  is  1.7  T, 
insufficient  to  reach  1  GeV:  new  stronger  dipoles  are 
needed. 
The existing vacuum chamber imposes constraints on the 
dipole geometry: the new magnets can be 10% longer and 
all  sector  type  to  have  the  maximum  allowed  magnetic 
length. With a different shape of the polar shoe made of 
permendur and with the gap height reduced from 4 cm to 
3.7  cm,  we  can  achieve  the  needed  field  of  2.3  T.  More 
work and simulations are in progress to study the features 
and the quality of such magnets [5]. 

Wiggler OFF/ON options: Synchrotron Radiation 
Synchrotron  radiation  per  turn  depends  on  the  energy 

and on the bending radius in dipoles and wigglers as:

Four  wiggler  magnets  per  ring  are  currently  used  in 
DAφNE  to  double  the  lower  the  damping  times  and  to 
modulate the natural emittance of the beam. 

 

In  the  wiggler  ON  option  the  wiggler  field  is  constant 
from 0.51 to 1 GeV, because in the 0.51 GeV lattice it is 
in saturation and at 1 GeV the radiation from wigglers is 
enough  to  yield  short  damping  times  (Table  2).  The 
drawback  of  this  option  is  the  difficulty  to  control  the 
nonlinearities generated by the wigglers during the energy 
ramping.  

On the  other  hand the wiggler  OFF option is not much 
performing  at  low  energy,  but  it  is  preferable  in  the  on-
energy injection case because at 1 GeV damping times are 
enough short also without wigglers.

Optics  

• 

Two very similar lattices wiggler OFF/ON at 1 GeV have 
been calculated (Figures 4 and 5) with the following main 
features: 
•  only  one  low  beta  insertion  in  IR2,  where  the 
experimental  detector  is  housed  and  the  positron  and 
electron beams collide with a horizontal angle of ±15 
mrad; 
in  IR1,  four  FDDF  quadrupoles  and  a  ‘detuned’ 
vertical beta configuration (Figure 6) allow to separate 
the beam trajectories with a vertical bump of ±1 cm; 
•  horizontal  and  vertical  beta  functions  in  the  four 
achromat  arcs,  where  the  dispersion  is  higher,  are 
separated  to  correct  both  horizontal  and  vertical 
natural chromaticity with chromatic sextupoles; 
the  horizontal  beta  function  and  the  dispersion  are 
shaped  in  such  a  way  that the  natural  emittance does 
not  change  from  0.51  to  1  GeV  as  explained  in  the 
section above.

the  rotating  frame  method  [6]  as  in  DAφNE:  each 
quadrupole outside is rotated around its longitudinal axis 
following the rotation of the beam and two compensating 
solenoids  0.36  T  x  1  m  provide  cancellation  of  coupling 
outside the IR. Another possibility, instead of rotating the 
quadrupoles inside the detector, is to use superconducting 
quadrupoles with independent normal and skew windings 
as  developed  at  CESR  [7].  The  solenoid  fields  and  the 
quadrupole  rotation  angles  are  fixed.  At  the  injection 
energy  of  0.51  GeV  the  non  vanishing  coupling  from 
mismatched  quadrupole  rotation  angles  can  be  useful  to 
have  a  long  beam  lifetime  during  the  ramping  and  if 
necessary it can be controlled with the skew quadrupoles 
installed along the ring.

RF Parameters and longitudinal bunch 
distribution 

The  DAφNE  RF  cavity  cooling  system  can  withstand  a 
maximum accelerating field of 350 kV, corresponding to a 
RF  power  loss  of  35  kW  on  the  cavity  walls,  while  the 
maximum  RF  power  the  klystron  can  supply  is  150  kW. 
The  RF  power  to  be  delivered  to  the  beam  is  given  by 
Pbeam= Vloss Ibeam≈ 40.5 kW, assuming 90 keV/turn of total 
losses  (including  the  parasitic  ones).  Since  the  required 
accelerating voltage is 250 kV corresponding to a RF wall 
dissipation  of  ≈17.5  kW,  the  existing  RF  system  is 
completely compatible with the requirements. 

Bunch lengthening has been estimated by performing a 
multiparticle tracking. Using the impedance estimates and 
correspinding  wake  fields  calculated  for  the  present 
vacuum chamber [8] in the turbulent microwave threshold 
calculations and in the bunch lengthening simulations, the

Interaction Region 2 

The  low  beta  insertion  is  realized  with  four  FDDF 
quadrupoles  housed  inside  the  experimental  detector 
(Figure 7). Since they must be powered for variable beam 
energy, the only solution to fit them inside the detector is 
developing  superconducting  quadrupoles.  Two  further

around  the  longitudinal  axis.  The  coupling  at  the 
Interaction  Point  and  outside  IR2  can  be  corrected  with

Lifetime and background 

Background  and  beam  lifetime  at  DAφNE  are  strongly 
dominated by Touschek scattering. Touschek lifetime is a 
complicated function of machine parameters: at the larger 
energy  and  RF  voltage  of  DAFNE2  it  will  be  less  critical   
than   at the present   energy.   In fact with the parameters 
in  Tables  1  and  3  τtou  comes  out  to  be  650  min  as 
calculated  by  MAD8  with 
longitudinal  acceptance 
dominated by RF. Further quantitative simulations will be 
done  with  the  programs  developed  and  used  for  DAφNE 
that  consider  the  physical  aperture  of  the  vacuum 
chamber along the rings. 

Vacuum System 

Present layout can withstand the new configuration. In 
fact  in  DAFNE2  (0.45 A  and  1 GeV) synchrotron radiated 
photon  flux  is  1.8·1020  ph/s corresponding to a power of 
38  kW,  while  the  existing  vacuum  chamber  is  designed 
for a synchrotron radiation power of 50 kW. 

Feedback System 

No change is needed for the transverse feedback if the 
betatron  tunes  stay  constant  during  the  energy  ramping. 
The  longitudinal  feedback  can  follow  the  synchrotron 
frequency  variation 
range  with  eight 
synchronizable  filters.  Timing  is  not  critical  within  a 
synchronous RF phase up to 100 ps (the RF phase is 70 ps 
at 250 kV).

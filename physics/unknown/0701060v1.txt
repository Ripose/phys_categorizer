Abstract
The first reports on the “Space Magnetic Sail” concept appeared more 30 years ago. During the period
since some hundreds of research and scientific works have been published, including hundreds of
research report by professors at major famous universities. The author herein shows that all these
works related to Space Magnetic Sail concept are technically incorrect because their authors did not
take into consideration that solar wind impinging a MagSail magnetic field creates a particle magnetic
field opposed to the MagSail field. In the incorrect works, the particle magnetic field is hundreds times
stronger than a MagSail magnetic field. That means all the laborious and costly computations in
revealed in such technology discussions are useless: the impractical findings on sail thrust (drag), time
of flight within the Solar System and speed of interstellar trips are essentially worthless working data!
The author reveals the correct equations for any estimated performance of a Magnetic Sail as well as a
new type of Magnetic Sail (without a matter ring).

Key words: magnetic sail, theory of MagSail, space magnetic sail, Electrostatic MagSail

Introduction
The idea of utilizing the magnetic field to aggregate matter in space, harnessing a drag from solar wind
or receiving a thrust from an Earth- charged particle beam is old. The MagSail is a gigantic (more than
50 -100 km in radius) super-conductive ring located in outer space that produces a magnetic field and
reflects the impinging solar wind, or a particle beamed from the Earth. Unfortunately, the currently
used theory for computation of drag from solar wind or thrust from particle beam is complex. The
magnetic field changes in widely diapason, every particle moves in its own trajectory and it is
exquisitely difficult to accurately estimate a summary drag. Over the years, many space researchers
have offered many equations for drag estimation that give remarkably different results. However, no
known equations take into proper consideration the magnetic field of particles moved in a ring-shaped
magnetic field. These particles create their own magnetic field that is OPPOSED to the MagSail’s
magnetic field. This magnetic field of charged particles can be stronger—by hundreds times—than a
ring field. It can fully deactivate the MagSail magnetic field.

The simplest computation shows a profound mistake in all known works. The reader can find part of
them in [1]-[38], (see also [39]-[40]).
Take the typical MagSail ring: radius of ring is R = 50 km, electric current I =104 A. The intensity H1
of magnetic field in center of ring is

This intensity is approximately same of the ring as well as near it. We assume in our subsequent
computation that H1 = constant.
Take the typical solar wind flows into ring at distance from Sun 1 AU (the Earth’s orbit about its
primary star) with average wind speed V = 400 km/s, and density N = 107 1/m3. The solar wind
contains electrons and protons. Within the ring magnetic field they rotate under Lawrence force and

2

produce their own magnetic field that
is OPPOSED to the ring magnetic field, decreases it
(diamagnetic property), and pumps the ring magnetic energy into energy of its own magnetic field
(summary energy is constant). This magnetic field from the rotated electrons (we here neglect the
additional magnetic field from the rotated protons) can be estimated by equations (we consider only
electrons into the ring):

where H2 is magnetic intensity from rotated solar wind electrons, A/m; r is electron gyro-radius, m; i
is electric currency of solar wind electrons, A; V = 400 km/s is average solar wind speed, B1 is
magnetic intensity, T; µ0 = 4(cid:6)10-7 is magnetic constant.
Substituting our values, we received r = 18.2 m; i = 5024 A; H2 = 276 A/m. The last magnitude
shows that the magnetic intensity of solar wind electrons is in 2760 times greater (H2 >> H1) than the
ring magnetic intensity of MagSail! It is correct for any charged beam that interacts with the MagSail.
That means all research and computation (without an influence the solar wind or charged beam into
MagSail) is wrong and basically worthless for all practical space exploration and exploitation
applications.

How can it happen that hundreds of researchers, professors at famous universities, audiences of
specialists, members of scientific Conferences and Congresses, editors of scientific journals: "Journal
of Propulsion and Power" (Editor V. Yang); Journal "Spacecraft and Rockets", (Editor V. Zoby), paid
so little attention to student-level mistakes in many scientific publications and public presentations to
scientific conferences? More over, the director NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Mr. R.
Cassanova awarded (totaling more than $1 million dollars!) to his close associate, professor R.M.
Winglee (University of Washington) for pseudo-scientific work about MagSail [1]1. In eight years of
NIAC’s existence under him, Mr. Cassanova spent in excess of forty millions dollars of taxpayer
money in pseudo-scientific works, but has not presented to the public even one new researched
scientific concept. Since 90% of NIAC reports are pseudo-scientific or wrong works the Scientific
Committee of a famous organization, the CAGW (Citizen Against Government Waste), awarded
NIAC and Mr. Cassanova Pseudo-Nobel Prize-2005 [41]-[43]. 
 
It is still happening because popular textbook authors continue to consider the interaction between the
strong magnetic field of particle accelerators and small amount of charged particles where we can
neglect the influence of charged particles in magnetic field of the accelerator. With MagSail’s, we have
the opposed situation: the weak ring magnetic field and strong magnetic field of solar sail or charged
beam.

Theory
Below, the author suggests the correct theory of MagSail operation, which takes into consideration the
influence of the solar wind flow into the ring magnetic field and allows an estimation of the drag of
MagSail.
Let us to take the equations (2) in form:

Notice particularly the last equation (3). In this equation, the active is summary magnetic intensity B!
For getting the maximum solar wind drag the turn radius of heavy particles must be 90 degrees.
Assume R=R1=R2=R3. We have 6 equations (3) and 6 unknown values. From set equations (3) we
receive the estimation of the radius efficiency R:

From (4) we get minimal ring electric currency

For average solar wind speed V = 400 km/s the minimal ring electric currency is I = 6.65×103 A.
The solar wing drag, D, equals approximately
D

p(cid:6)=
Results of computation are presented in figures 1 - 2. Look you attention: for receiving good drag we
need in high electric current. For typical current I = 104 A (I = 10 kA) the efficiency radius R and drag
D are small.

The conventional MagSail with super-conductive ring has big drawbacks:

1.

It is very difficult to locate gigantic (tens of km radius) ring in outer space.

New Electrostatic MagSail (EMS)

4

It is difficult to insert a big energy into superconductive ring.

2.
3. Super-conductive ring needs a low temperature to function at all. The Sun heats all bodies in
the Solar System to a temperature higher then temperature of super-conductive materials.

4. The super-conductive ring explodes if temperature is decreased over critical value.
5.

It is difficult to control the value of MagSail thrust and the thrust direction.

The author offers new Electrostatic MagSail (EMS). The innovation includes the central positive
charged small ball and a negative electronic equal density ring rotated around the ball (fig.3).

Fig.3. Electrostatic MagSail. Notations: 1 - Spaceship; 2 - Positive charged ball; 3 - electrical
ring; 4 - solar wind; 5 - EMS drag. In right side the EMS in turn position.

The suggested EMS has the following significant advantages in comparison with conventional
MagSail:

1) No heavy super-conductive large ring.
2) No cooling system for ring is required.
3) Electronic ring is safe.
4) The thrust (ring radius) easy changes by changing of ball charge.

Electrostatic MagSail Theory

Let us consider a method of estimation of electronic ring magnetic intensity in the electronic ring’s
center [2]. We will take into consideration a repulsion of electrons from electron ring (blocking the ball
charge by the electronic ring) and relativistic speed of electrons. We will not take into consideration
diamagnetic property of solar wind or charged beam because our purpose here is only to find the
magnetic intensity from electronic ring. The blocking the MagSail magnetic field by the particles flow
the reader find in previous section (above). We also neglect the radiation of rotary electronic ring
because the ring is right circle, has constant density and that does not emit synchronous radiation (this
assumption needs further research. Synchronous radiation appears when electrons rotate in outer
magnetic field, the electron ring is unclosed or has non-constant density. In our case the ring electric
and magnetic fields are constant and not emit energy in outer space).

where M is mass of electron ring, kg; Ve is speed of electrons, m/s; R is ring radius, m; k = 9×109 is

ring, C; me is mass of electron, kg; q = 1.6×10-19 is electron charge, C.

The Eqs. (7) - (11) allow to find magnetic intensity of MagSail for given ring radius and electron
speed (without solar wind or plasma beam), charge and radius of ball for given electrostatic ball
intensity, energy of rotate ring, but they do not permit to estimate a MagSail drag. We can estimate
drag of conventional MagSail (see section above), to compute the drag of electrostatic sail offered by
author in [3] Chapter 18, but unfortunately we cannot to estimate for the drag EMS in the time present.
The trajectory of charged particle into both field (magnetic and electric) are very complex.

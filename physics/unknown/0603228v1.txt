We  report  a  theoretical  study  of  clusters  of  evanescently-coupled  2D  whispering-gallery 
(WG)  mode  optical  micro-cavities  (termed  ”photonic  molecules”)  as  chemosensing  and 
biosensing  platforms.  Photonic  molecules  (PMs)  supporting  modes  with  narrow 
linewidths,  wide  mode  spacing,  and  greatly  enhanced  sensitivity  to  the  changes  in  the 
dielectric constant of their environment and to the presence of individual sub-wavelength-
sized nanoparticles in the PM evanescent-field region are numerically designed. This type 
of optical biosensor can be fabricated in a variety of material platforms and integrated on a 
single chip that makes it a promising candidate for a small and robust lab-on-a-chip device. 
Possible applications of the developed methodology and the designed PM structures to the 
near-field  microscopy,  single  nano-emitter  microcavity  lasing,  and  cavity-controlled 
single-molecule fluorescence enhancement are also discussed.

Introduction 
The  growing  need  for  miniaturized  instruments  for  medical,  food  and  environmental  testing 
together  with  raising  level  of  bioterrorism  concerns  have  fueled  the  development  of  optical 
biosensors. Optical microcavities (microdisks and microspheres) supporting high-Q WG modes 
(with light confined near the resonator surface by almost total internal reflection) have already 
been  demonstrated  to  have  great  potential  in  the  development  of  inexpensive,  ultra-compact, 
highly sensitive and robust bio- and chemical sensors1-9. As compared to more traditional linear 
optical waveguide or fiber biosensors, microresonator-based devices benefit from much smaller 
size (several μm rather than a few centimetres) and higher sensitivity. Optical resonators enable 
significant decrease of analyte sample needed for efficient sensing. 

Two  basic  sensing  principles  are  usually  employed  in  microresonator-based  optical 
sensors. First class of sensors are designed to detect the resonant frequency shift caused by the 
change  of  the  refractive  index  of  the  surrounding  environment  through  the  interaction  of  the 
evanescent  field  of  the  WG-mode  outside  the  microcavity  with  the  biochemical  agent  (mass 
sensing)2-8.  This  refractive  index  change  can  be  caused  by  the  change  of  the  concentration  of 
bio(chemical) material on the resonator surface or in the surrounding solution. Detection can also 
be  made  by  measuring  the  output  intensity  change  from  the  microresonator  at  a  fixed 
wavelength. The other class of devices uses the evanescent field of the microresonator to excite 
the  spectroscopic  (fluorescence  or  Raman)  signal  from  the  molecules  of  the  analyte 
(fluorescence sensing)9,10. In both methods, high Q-factors (narrow resonant linewidths and long 
cavity decay lifetimes) of the resonator modes are crucial for achieving high sensor sensitivity.

Microdisk resonators offer certain advantages over microspheres for use as biosensors as 
they  can  be  fabricated  with  standard  microfabrication  technologies  and  easily  integrated  with 
other components and bus waveguides on a semiconductor chip.  However, similar to the case of 
microspheres, there are several factors that may hinder the use of WG-mode circular microdisk 
resonators as sensitive and robust biosensing platforms. First of all, for a high-Q WG mode in a 
single  microdisk,  the  interaction  of  the  evanescent  mode  field  with  the  analyte  is  weak  due  to 
high confinement of the modal field inside the resonator. Furthermore, the wavelength spacing 
between  high-Q  WG  modes  in  optically-large  cavities  becomes  so  small  that  the  individual 
modes  cannot be resolved.  They  form  a  relatively broad peak in  a  measured  cavity  spectrum8, 
making efficient detection difficult. On the other hand, widely spaced WG modes supported by 
wavelength-scale  nano-cavities  have  low  Q-factors,  whose  values  decrease  exponentially  with 
decreased  mode  azimuthal  order11.  The  symmetry of  circular  microdisks  also  results in double 
degeneracy of the WG modes they support (corresponding to the mode angular field dependence 
cos(mφ) or sin(mφ) ). This degeneracy is often removed by fabrication imperfections that break 
the symmetry of the structure and cause appearance of parasitic peaks in the resonator spectra12. 
To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we suggest using clusters of coupled nano-
cavities  (photonic  molecules)13  with  wide  free  spectral  range  tuned  to  a  symmetry-enhanced 
high-Q WG mode resonance14 instead of a larger single microcavity. Properly designed photonic 
molecules  (PMs)  have  already  demonstrated  high  potential  for  the  design  of  low-threshold 
microlasers14-17. In a previous publication14, we have shown that by arranging circular WG-mode 
microcavities into pre-designed symmetrical configurations it is possible not only to preserve but 
also  to  significantly  enhance  their  attractive  features,  such  as  the  high  Q-factors,  and 
simultaneously  remove  the  obstacles  hindering  their  use,  namely,  the  WG-mode  double 
degeneracy. In this work, for the first time to our knowledge, it is shown (through 2D numerical 
simulations based on the presented here rigorous integral-equation method) that optimally tuned 
PMs  also  demonstrate  significant  enhancement  of  the  sensitivity  to  the  changes  in  their 
environment.  Furthermore,  we  demonstrate  that  arranging  such  PMs  into  symmetrical  “super-
molecules” results in even further enhancement of their Q-factors and sensitivity, paving a way 
for their use as sensitive nano-scale biochemical sensors on a chip. Finally, we show that such 
PMs also enable detection of individual nanoparticles with the sizes below the diffraction limit. 

Problem geometry and methodology  
Photonic molecules composed of several evanescently-coupled microcavities supporting high-Q 
WG  modes  play  an  important  role  in  photonics  research  as  they  can  potentially  find  use  for 
various  applications  ranging  from  optical  power  transfer  via  coupled  resonator  optical 
waveguides to low-threshold PM microlasers. A photonic molecule composed of L side-coupled 
microdisk  resonators  is  considered  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  The  dielectric  (or  semiconductor) 
lε   (l = 1 ...L)  are  located  in  a  host  medium  with 
microdisks  of  radii 

la   and  permittivities 

permittivity 

eε .  

For  thin  disks,  the  three-dimensional  problem  of  finding  the  eigenfrequencies  of  the 
photonic  molecule  can  be  replaced  with  an  equivalent  2-D  formulation  by  using  the  effective-
index method to account for the vertical field confinement (the disk permittivities should then be 
replaced  with  their  corresponding  effective  values)18.  In  the  rest  of  this  paper,  we  will  thus 
restrict ourselves to simplified 2-D calculations. The effective refractive index of the disks used 
in the following sections (neff = 2.63) may correspond to e.g. air-clad 165-nm thick silicon disks 
(n  = 3.52)  located on  a silica  substrate (n  = 1.444) or  200-nm  thick  InGaAsP disks  (n  = 3.37)

suspended in the air at 1550 nm. To account for the material losses in the cavity, we also assume 
a  small  positive  value  of  the  imaginary  part  of  the  cavity  effective  dielectric  constant  (εeff  = 
6.9169+i10-4). Applying the Green’s formula to the fields (
lU ) and the Green’s functions in the 
regions  inside  (
lG )  all  the  microcavities  and  taking  into  account  the 
transparency conditions at the cavity boundaries, we can formulate the problem in terms of the 2-
D Muller boundary integral equations (MBIEs)18:

Note that the analytical procedure developed here for the case of L electromagnetically coupled 
microcavities is a generalization of the solution for a single isolated microcavity18. Equations (1) 
are the Fredholm second-kind integral equations with either smooth or integrable kernels and are 
free of spurious solutions. Thus, their discretization yields well-conditioned matrices18.  

Note that formulation (1) is valid for  microdisks of arbitrary smooth cross-sections. As 
the  next  step of  the  solution procedure,  we  shall obtain  a  discretized  form  of  the MBIEs  for  a 
specific  (and  important  for  a  number  of  practical  applications)  case  of  L  coupled  circular 
microdisks  of  different  radii  al.  The  expressions  for  the  Green’s  functions  for  the  case  of  the 
source point Q located inside and the observation point P located either inside or outside of the 
p-th microcavity of radius ap and permittivity εp immersed into a host medium with permittivity 
εe can be written in the coordinate system associated with the p-th cavity as follows (see Fig. 2a):

Now we substitute the above expressions into the MBIEs (1), and expand the unknown functions 
in terms of the Fourier series with angular exponents as global basis functions. Testing against 
the  same  set  of  global  functions  yields  the  final  matrix  equation  that  needs  to  be  solved  to 
mu  and 
determine the unknown Fourier coefficients

Coefficients  ma - md  of matrix (6) correspond to the matrix coefficients of a problem for 
an isolated p-th cavity, while coefficients  mnA -
mnD  describe the optical coupling between the p-
th and the l-th cavities. It should be noted here that if several microcavities are arranged in a PM 
with the inter-cavity spacing comparable to the cavities sizes and the optical wavelength, these 
coefficients  play  a  very  important  role  in  the  numerical  solution,  as  mutual  electromagnetic 
interactions  inside  the  structure  can  drastically  affect  its  optical  properties.  Such  PMs  support 
collective super-modes, whose frequencies and Q-factors may vary significantly from those of a 
single microcavity. The algorithm presented here yields analytical expressions for all the matrix 
coefficients and thus provides superior accuracy of numerical solutions. 

Homogeneous equation (6) has nonzero solutions only at frequencies where the equation 
matrix becomes singular. Complex eigenfrequencies of the optical modes supported by a set of 
coupled resonators are found by searching for the roots of the matrix determinant in the complex 
frequency  plane.  Once  the  eigenfrequencies  are  found,  the  modal  fields  and  emission 
characteristics  can  be  calculated  by  solving  the  homogeneous  matrix  equation  (6)  at  the 
eigenfrequencies.  In  the  frame  of  the  2−D  model,  the  numerical  results  are  exact  up  to  the 
truncation  error  of  angular  Fourier  series,  and  up  to  the  accuracy  of  the  root  searching  in  the 
complex plane (both operations have been performed with machine precision). 

Q-factor and FSR increase in the optimally tuned PM 
As  it  has  been  mentioned  in  the  introduction,  microcavity-based  sensors  either  detect  the 
presence  of  a  gas  or  an  analyte  in  the  cavity  cladding  by  measuring  the  resonant  mode 
wavelength  shift  (mass  sensing)  or  measure  the  enhanced  fluorescence  from  the  cladding 
material at the resonant wavelength of the microcavity (fluorescence sensing). In both types of 
applications,  high  value  of  the  Q-factor  of  the  cavity  mode  used  for  detection  is  crucial  for 
efficient  and  robust  detection,  as  the  resonance  linewidth  and  the  fluorescence  enhancement 
effect are directly related to this value.  

Whispering-gallery  modes  supported  by  microdisks  are  classified  as  WGBmnlB  modes,  m 
being  the  azimuthal  number,  n  the  radial  number,  and  l  the  vertical  number.  In  thin  disks 
considered in this paper, l = 1 and will be omitted in the following discussion. Furthermore, only 
TE-polarized  (having  electric  field  mostly  in  the  cavity  plane)  modes  will  be  considered  as  in 
thin disks they have much larger effective refractive index values and are dominant11. The field 
in the 2D setting is thus determined by a scalar principal vertical (out of plane) magnetic field 
component Hz. It is known that theoretical values of the Q-factors of the circular microdisk WG 
modes  grow  exponentially  with  increased  disk  radius  (increased  modes  azimuthal  number)11. 
This dependence is clearly observed in Fig. 3, where the Q-factors of the WG modes in circular 
microdisks  with  increasing  diameters  are  plotted.  All  the  modes  presented  in  Fig.  3  have

resonant  wavelengths  around  λ  =  1.55  μm.  However,  such  exponential  Q-factor  grows  is  not 
observed in real-life microdisks, as high-Q values of higher-azimuthal-order modes are spoiled 
by the cavity sidewall surface roughness12,21.

Another  important  cavity  characteristic,  the  free  spectral  range  (FSR)  or  mode  spectral 
spacing  is  also  plotted  in  Fig.  3.  Large  FSR  value  is  especially  important  for  the  fluorescence 
sensing as solvated fluorescent molecules usually have large emission bandwidths. Note that the 
cavity  FSR  should  be  much  greater  than  the  emission  spectral  width  in  order  to  yield  the  net 
fluorescence  enhancement9,22,23.  Unlike  the  Q-factors,  the  FSR  values  decrease  with  the 
increased  cavity  size  (Fig.  3).  It  should  also  be  noted  that  if  the  cavity  surface  roughness  or 
coupling  to  a  bus  waveguide  lifts  the  WG-mode  degeneracy,  the  FSR  values  become  much 
smaller. 

Finally,  it  should  be  taken  into  account  that  the  WG-mode  interaction  with  the  analyte 
occurs only through the evanescent portion of the mode  field. Optical field of  the high-Q WG 
modes  is  very  efficiently  confined  in  the  microdisk  and  therefore  these  modes  are  not  very 
sensitive to the small changes in the microcavity environment. Near-field distributions (portraits 
of 
) of the WG4,1 mode in  a smaller 1.34-μm diameter microdisk, and of  the WG7,1 
mode in a larger 2 μm-diameter cavity are presented in Figs. 4 a and b, respectively. It can be 
clearly seen that the WG4,1 mode field extends much farther into the surrounding medium in the 
cavity  plane.  This  presence  of  the  region  of  relatively  high  field  intensity  outside  the  cavity 
makes  the cavity  characteristics sensitive to the presence of the analyte in the cladding. At the

same  time,  the  poor  mode  confinement  results  in  the  very  low  WG4,1  mode  Q-factor  value, 
Q=50.8 (for comparison, the Q-factor of the WG7,1 mode is 1660). 
this  contradiction, 

this  paper  suggests  arranging  low-Q  high-FSR 
nanocavities  into  pre-designed  symmetrical  configurations  supporting  symmetry-enhanced 
photonic  molecule  super-modes  with  high  Q-factors.  For  example,  a  square  PM  configuration 
has already been shown to offer significantly   (over 20 times) enhanced Q-factor of  the WG6,1 
molecule mode having odd field symmetry along the diagonals and even symmetry along the x- 
and y- axes (OE-mode)14. As it is demonstrated in Fig. 5, this Q-factor boost can be achieved by 
optimally  tuning  the  inter-cavity  coupling  distance.  Fig.  5  a,b  shows  the  dependence  of  the 
resonant wavelength shifts and Q-factor  enhancements  of three PM supermodes with four, six, 
and eight azimuthal field variations on the distance from the cavities centers to the PM center. 
Clearly,  the  lower  the  cavity  azimuthal  WG-mode  number,  the  more  sensitive  it  is  to  the 
presence of other cavities forming the photonic molecule. This higher sensitivity results in even 
more dramatic Q-factor enhancement (over 50 times) of the WG4,1-supermode of OE symmetry 
(QOE = 2768 for dm = 1.101 μm). A near-field intensity portrait of the WG4,1 OE -supermode is 
shown  in  Fig.  5  c.  It  should  be  also  noted  that  for  this  optimal  PM  configuration  all  the  other 
closely located PM supermodes of different symmetries have Q-factor values many times lower, 
so that the PM free spectral range is equal to that of a single cavity.  

Next, in Fig 6a we observe that arranging four optimally-tuned PMs (with dm = 1.101 μm) 
into a square configuration – we call it a photonic super-molecule (PSM) – and again adjusting 
the  coupling  distance  ds  yields  even  further  enhancement  of  the  Q-factor  of  the  PSM  OE-
supermode  (QOE  =  6656  for  ds  =  2.216  μm).  The  optimal  configuration  of  the  sixteen-cavity 
photonic  super-molecule  together  with  the  PSM  OE-supermode  intensity  portrait  is  shown  in 
Fig. 6 b. Note that the PSM is not a periodic microdisk array but rather a fractal-like structure: 
the distances between four PMs (ds) and between four microdisks composing each PM (dm) have 
been  tuned  separately,  and  the  inter-cavity  separations  are  not  identical  for  all  the  neighboring 
cavities.  Once  again,  the  FSR  of  the  optimally-tuned  PSM  is  equal  to  its  single-cavity 
counterpart. 

Sensitivity enhancement at PM resonances 
As PM modes are collective multi-cavity resonances, we expect their resonant frequencies to be 
more  sensitive  to  changes  in  their  environment  (e.g.,  variations  of  the  refractive  index  in  the 
inter-cavity  region)  than  the  corresponding  characteristics  of  a  larger  single  cavity  with  a 
comparable value of the Q-factor. In general, a microcavity configuration that provides a better 
overlap  of  the  modal  field  with  the  analyte  without  degrading  the  mode  Q  factor  should  offer 
enhanced sensitivity6. 

Now, we compare the shifts of the resonant frequencies of a single microdisk WG mode 
and of the symmetry-enhanced OE supermodes of smaller-radius disks arranged into optimally-
tuned configurations caused by the change of the refractive index of the host medium. As a test 
single-cavity structure, we chose a 2 μm-diameter microdisk resonator supporting a WG7,1 mode 
with the Q-factor value (Q = 1660) of the same order as the PM OE-supermode Q-factor. WG8,1 
mode in a larger-radius microdisk will have a higher Q-factor value (see Fig. 3) but will be even 
less sensitive to the changes in the refractive index outside the resonator. As illustrated in Fig. 
7a,  the  cavity  mode  wavelengths  linearly  shift  to  higher  values  as  the  refractive  index  value 
outside  the  resonator  (i.e.,  gas  or  solution  concentration)  is  increased.  Clearly,  the  refractive 
index sensitivity (determined by the slope of the lines in Fig. 7a) is enhanced for the PM-based 

 

8

sensor and even further enhanced for the PSM-based one. Also note (Fig. 7b) that although all 
the modes Q-factors degrade slowly due to lowered index contrast between the microcavity and 
the cladding material, the PM and PSM Q-factors remain higher than the single-cavity mode Q-
factor.  It  can  also  be  expected  that  the  increased  overlap of  the  evanescent  field of  the  high-Q 
PM  and  SPM  modes  with  the  surrounding  medium  would  yield  enhanced  performance  of 
biosensors based on the PMs immersed in a fluorophore solution.

Next, to calibrate the PM-based sensor for the detection of various solvents in the cladding 
of the structure, we consider a square PM consisting of the water-clad (n = 1.333) 200-nm thick, 
1.3 μm-diameter silicon disks (n = 3.52) located on a silica substrate (n = 1.444). The effective 
refractive  index  of  the  microcavities  is  neff  =  2.813.  The  optimally-tuned  PM  configuration 
yielding  the  symmetry-enhanced  WG4,1  OE-supermode  corresponds  to  ds  =  1.078  μm.  As 
illustrated  in  Fig.  8,  the  resonant  wavelength  of  the  OE-supermode  of  a  photonic  molecule 
systematically shifts to higher values with the increase of the refractive index of the solvent. The 
points  on  the  plot  correspond  to  the  refractive  indices  of  (a)  pure  water3,  (b)  0.5%  glucose 
solution24, (c) 10% glucose solution, (d) EtOH3, (e) 1-propanol25. For example, changing of the 
cladding  refractive  index  from  that  of  water  (n  =  1.3330)  to  alcohol  (n  =  1.3614)  and  to  1-
propanol (n = 1.3845) yields significant resonant wavelength upshifts of 4.28 nm and 7.88 nm, 
respectively (Fig. 8). Linear regression analysis yields a value of the refractive index sensitivity 
of 153 nm  RIU-1.  This theoretically  predicted value of  the  refractive  index sensitivity is of  the 
same  order  as  the  experimentally  reported  typical  sensitivity  values  of  surface  plasmon 
biosensors  based  on  individual  chemically  synthesized  Ag  nanoparticles  (160-235  nm  RIU-1)25 
and as the values reported for nanolithography-fabricated Ag nanoparticle arrays (191 nm RIU-
1)26.  Note,  however,  that  the  Q-factors  of  the  surface  plasmon  resonances  on  noble-metal 
nanoparticles are much lower than corresponding values of the optical microcavity WG-modes. 
For  comparison,  the  measured  refractive  index  sensitivity  of  a  sensor  based  on  a  single  Si3N4 
circular microdisk resonator3 (Q = 4900) is only 22.89 nm RIU-1.

Single-particle detection  
Finally,  we  explore  a  capability  of  the  PM-based  sensors  to  detect  individual  sub-wavelength 
sized nanoparticles (note that conventional optical microscopy is limited to a spatial resolution of 
about 200 mn, or a half of the wavelength of visible light) 27. Similar to the cases of the mass or 
fluorescence  sensing,  the  nanoparticle  can  interact  with  a  microdisk  or  a  PM  mode  field  only 
through a small part of the mode expanding outside the resonator material as an evanescent field. 
This particle-WG mode coupling results in the frequency shift of the mode that can be measured 
to  detect  the  presence  of  the  nanoparticle.  Fig.  9  presents  wavelength  shifts  of  the  WG4,1  OE-
supermode  of  a  square  photonic  molecule  (Fig.  9a)  and  of  the  WG7,1  mode  of  a  single 
microcavity  (Fig.  9b)  caused  by  a  presence  of  a  single  nanoparticle  as  a  function  of  the 
nanoparticle radius. Two circular-shape dielectric nanoparticles are  considered,  with npart = 1.5 
and  npart  =  2,  and  the  microdisk  and  the  PM  parameters  are  the  same  as  in  Figs.  3-5.  The 
nanoparticles  are  located  either  in  between  two  neighboring  cavities  in  the  PM  or  at  1  nm 
distance from the outer microdisk rim (nanoparticle positions relative to the sensors are shown in 
the insets to Figs. 9a and b, respectively).

Nanoparticle radius (nm)

 

 
Fig. 9. Comparison of the wavelength shifts of the symmetry-enhanced PM WG4,1 OE-supermode (a) 
and  of  the  single-disk  WG7,1  mode  (b)  as  a  function  of  the  radius  of  the  detected  nanoparticle. 
Degenerate microdisk mode splitting due to the presence of the nanoparticle is also observed in Fig. 
9b. The insets show the nanoparticle positions relative to the microresonator structures. 

Mode wavelengths shifts with the increased nanoparticle size are observed in both cases, 
though  the  PM  supermode  shows  higher  sensitivity  to  the  presence  of  the  nanoparticle.  As  it 
could be expected, higher-index nanoparticle causes more significant modes frequency shifts of 
both  structures.  However,  because  the  presence  of  the  nanoparticle  close  to  the  microdisk 
sidewall  disturbs  the  circular  symmetry  of  the  structure,  not  only  shift  but  also  splitting  of  the 
microdisk WG-mode frequency can be observed in Fig. 9b. The wavelength spacing between the 
two  split  modes  is  about  0.2-0.3  nm,  and  this  value  drops  rapidly  with  the  increase  of  the 
nanoparticle-microcavity  gap.  Appearance  of  these  two  very  closely  located  split  modes  with 
comparable  Q-factors  will  complicate  efficient  detection  of  the  nanoparticle.  As  the  PM  OE-
mode  is  non-degenerate,  no  mode  splitting  occurs  in  Fig.  9a.  Thus,  optimally-tuned  PM 
structures  are  expected  to  perform  better  that  single  microcavities  in  the  sensor  applications 
aimed at detection of single nanoparticles such as proteins, antibodies or viral particles as well as 
at monitoring processes of synthesis and aggregation27.

Finally, accurate account for the evanescent-field interaction of a high-Q microcavity mode 
with a nano-particle (or a fiber tip) provided by the developed theoretical framework is important 
for  a  variety  of  applications,  including  near-field  microscopy28,29,  lasing  with  a  single  nano-
emitter  such  as  an  individual  nano-crystal  or  a  quantum  dot30,  and  enhancement  of  single-
molecule fluorescence31. In order to correctly interpret the experimental results, the effect of the 
tip  or  the  nano-emitter  on  the  cavity  optical  mode  frequency  and  Q-factor  has  to  be  carefully 
evaluated.  Furthermore,  in  all  these  applications,  when  a  tip  or  a  nano-emitter  is  placed  in  the 
evanescent-field  region  of  the  microcavity  it  acts  as  a  perturbing  element  that  may  yield 
degenerate  cavity  mode  splitting  (Fig.  9b).  Thus,  optimally-tuned  quasi-single  mode  PM 
structures  studied  in  this  paper  would  offer  improved  performance  over  conventional 
symmetrical cavity geometries such as microdisks and microspheres. 

Fabrication tolerances and on-chip integration 
To  achieve  the  nanometer  wavelength  precision  of  high-index-contrast  photonic  molecule 
structures,  nanometer  geometry  precision  should  be  maintained.  However,  modern  lithography 
techniques  together  with  optimized  etching  processes  enable  fabrication  of  wavelength-scale 
optoelectronic  components  such  as  photonic  wire  waveguides,  microring  and  microdisk 
resonators,  and  photonic-crystal  circuits  with  very  high  and  controllable  precision32.  For 
example, isolated microdisks33 and large regular microdisk arrays34 with diameters of and below 
2  µm  have  been  fabricated  with  high  structural  and  optical  quality,  and  their  experimentally 
measured WG-mode frequencies and Q-factors have been reported to be remarkably close to the 
theoretical  values  predicted  in  the  frame  of  simplified  2-D  models16,18,33,34.  Various  techniques 
have also been developed for the reduction of the sidewall surface roughness (which is one of the 
principal  sources  of  optical  modes  Q-factors  degradation)  such  as,  e.g.,  thermal  oxidation  of 
silicon-on-insulator  photonic  components35.  Furthermore,  lower-radial-order  modes  of  smaller 
microdisks have been shown to exhibit better tolerance to the nanoscale surface roughness than 
high-radial-order high-Q WG modes in larger resonators21. 

Finally,  by  coupling  optimally-tuned  photonic  molecules  to  bus  waveguides,  integrated 
semiconductor  devices  can  be  realized.  In  this  case  the  C4ν  symmetry  of  the  structure  may  be 
distorted, which can result in degrading the Q-factors of the PM super-modes. However, as it has 
been  previously  demonstrated  for  square-microdisk  optical  waveguide  filters,  this  loss  of  C4ν 
symmetry  can  be  compensated  and  the  high  Q-factors  maintained  by  slightly  elongating  the 
structure along the waveguide36. 

Conclusions 
Summarizing,  we  proposed  use  of  coupled-microdisk  photonic  molecules  that  are  tuned  to 
support  high-Q  WG-supermodes  as  a  possible  biochemical  sensor  platform.  Such  PMs  can  be 
efficiently designed with the rigorous analytical method and the numerical algorithm presented 
in this paper. It is theoretically demonstrated that the resonant wavelengths of the supermodes of 
optimal  PM  configurations  are  much  more  sensitive  to  the  changes  of  the  refractive  index  of 
their  environment  than  single-cavity  WG-modes  with  comparable  or  even  lower  Q-factors. 
Furthermore,  PM-based  sensors  show  promise  in  detecting  individual  nanoparticles  with  the 
sizes  below  the  diffraction  limit,  such  as  viral  particles  and  proteins.  We  attribute  the 
demonstrated sensitivity enhancement to the increased overlap of the evanescent fields of the PM 
modes with the detected biological or chemical material.

Abstract

The group SU (3) is parameterized in terms of generalized “Euler
angles”. The diﬀerential operators of SU (3) corresponding to the
Lie Algebra elements are obtained, the invariant forms are found, the
group invariant volume element is found, and some relevant comments
about the geometry of the group manifold are made.

1 Introduction

For a long time the algebra of SU(3) has been studied for its application to
physics. It’s important to particle physics not only due to the now famous
Eight-fold way developed by Gell-Mann and Ne’eman [1], which has become
known as ﬂavor SU(3), but also due to the color SU(3) of QCD ([2] contains
an excellent review along with a meticulous set of references). Color SU(3)
was introduced for consistency in the quark model to give the quark wave
functions their observed fermionic nature within the ﬂavor framework. The
color SU(3) is believed to be an exact gauge symmetry, whereas the ﬂavor
symmetry is broken by the quark masses. They are both very important
to our present understanding of particle physics as well as is the SU(3)
nuclear physics model. This is based on the SU(3) symmetry group of the

3-d isotropic harmonic oscillator. Until now the algebra of SU(3) has been
studied extensively but the geometry of the group manifold has had much
less attention. Hopefully that will eventually change. The work done here
could help to further the use of the group itself. The explicit forms of the
left and right invariant vector ﬁelds and left and right invariant one-forms
are given in terms of the Euler angle parameterization. These should help
with any subsequent study of the group manifold.

To summarize, in section 2 the method for determining the left and right
invariant vector ﬁelds of SU(3) is discussed and the explicit forms of the
operators are given in terms of the Euler angle parameterization. In section
3 the group invariant forms are given enabling the derivation of the group
invariant volume element, i.e., the Haar measure in section 4. Finally, in
section 5, some of the many applications are discussed.

2 The Lie Algebra of SU (3)

The Lie Algebra of a group is a set of left invariant vector ﬁelds on the group
manifold. These can be constructed by a method that has been applied to
SU(2) (see for example [3]) and can, in principle, be used for SU(n). Here
it is done explicitly for SU(3).

2.1 “Euler Angle” Decomposition

To decompose the group into the “Euler angle” parameterization we ﬁrst
consider the algebra. The algebra must obey the commutation relations
given in the table below. The Gell-Mann matrices provide the most common
3 hermitian, traceless matrices. This set is
representation in terms of 3
linearly independent and is the lowest dimensional faithful representation of

The entries in the table are given by commuting the element in the ﬁrst
column, (i.e., the element of the algebra in the column separated by the
double line) with the element in the top row (which is also separated by a
double line). The reason for displaying the whole table is two-fold. First, it

is easy to read oﬀ the structure constants, deﬁned by:

[λi, λj] = C k

ijλk.

Second, we can see the relationship in the algebra that deﬁnes a so-called
Cartan decomposition. That is, for subsets of the group manifold, K, and
(P ), subsets of the Lie Algebra of SU(3),
P , there corresponds

we have a decomposition of the group,

Here K is the SU(2) subgroup obtained by exponentiating the corresponding
plus λ8. Since λ8 commutes with this SU(2) subgroup,
algebra
this can be written as

λ1, λ2, λ3}

{

K = e(iλ3α)e(iλ2β)e(iλ3γ)e(iλ8φ).

Then we may decompose P . Of the four elements of P , we can pick one, say
λ5, analogous to the Jy = J2 of SU(2) and write any element of P as

P = K ′e(iλ5θ)K ′,

where K ′ is another copy of K. Dropping the redundancies, we arrive at
the following product for SU(3). (This proof was adapted from the book by
Hermann [4] and ﬁrst pointed out to me by Biedenharn [5].)

D(α, β, γ, θ, a, b, c, φ) = e(iλ3α)e(iλ2β)e(iλ3γ)e(iλ5θ)e(iλ3a)e(iλ2b)e(iλ3c)e(iλ8φ), (1)

4

where D is an arbitrary element of SU(3). This can be written as

D(3)(α, β, γ, θ, a, b, c, φ) = D(2)(α, β, γ)e(iλ5θ)D(2)(a, b, c)e(iλ8φ),

where the D(3) denotes an arbitrary element of SU(3) and D(2) is an arbitrary
element of SU(2) as a subset of SU(3).

As stated above, this method could, in principle, be used to decompose
SU(n) into an Euler angle type parameterization. This would enable the
calculation of the left and right invariant vector ﬁelds and one forms as
discussed below.

2.2 The Vector Fields

The way to ﬁnd the diﬀerential operators corresponding to the Lie alge-
bra elements is now rather simple but messy. To do this, take derivatives
of D(α, β, γ, θ, a, b, c, φ) in (1) with respect to each of its parameters. For
brevity, I’ll call this just D. One then obtains the following results, using the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorﬀ relation,:

These are the ﬁrst three. Continuing this, we obtain linear combinations of
the Lie algebra elements, (the λ’s). The diﬀerential operators are then given
by

(5)
Where the minus sign is on the λ acting as a diﬀerential operator2. The
eight equations and eight unknowns may then be solved to ﬁnd the following

The right diﬀerential operators (the diﬀerential operators that correspond to
this action when acting from the right) are diﬀerent and are denoted Λr
i . One
may ﬁnd these “right” diﬀerential operators in two ways. First, one may use
the relation

that

SO(8) is an element of the adjoint representation of SU(3). It

is therefore a function of the eight parameters above. The right invariant
vector ﬁelds are then given by the following equations.

The calculation of the left invariant vector ﬁelds acting on the D matrices
was ﬁrst attempted by T.J. Nelson [6]. However, the assumption of a singlet
state for each irreducible representation was assumed. This shortcomming is
well noted by the author and was not used here.

3 The Invariant Forms

The left invariant forms for the manifold are dual to the left invariant vector
ﬁelds. Take the left invariant vector ﬁelds that make up the Lie algebra

λi = aj

i ∂j

ωl = bl

kdxk

and use the duality between the tangent and cotangent vectors to construct
left invariant one forms. If we take the left invariant one forms to have the
form

then

i =< ωi, λl >= bl
δl

kaj

i < dαj, ∂k >= bl

kaj

i δk
j ,

therefore the matrices b and a are inverse transposes of each other. In this
way, we obtain left(and analogously right) invariant forms on the group man-
ifold. The left invariant forms are given by:

Thus one may integrate over the whole space or any subspace of the group

manifold by the appropriate wedge product of these forms.

4 Invariant Volume Element

The group invariant volume element may be calculated in two diﬀerent ways.
One way is to take an arbitrary A

SU(3) and ﬁnd the matrix

∈
A−

1dA

(42)

of left invariant one-forms and then wedge the 8 linearly independent forms
together. A simpler way to do this is to explicitly compute the wedge product
of the invariant one forms calculated above. This is equivalent to computing
the determinant of the matrix of coeﬃcients that appear in (34)-(41). (the
determinant correctly alternates the signs corresponding to the permutations
of the diﬀerentials in the wedge product.) The result is

dV = sin 2β sin 2b sin 2θ sin2 θ dα dβ dγ dθ da db dc dφ.

This agrees with the result of Holland[7]. This is determined only up to a
dV = 1.
constant factor since the normalization is determined by setting
It is also easily seen to give left invariant quantities. For if one constructs
this with left invariant vector ﬁelds and uses the duality expressed in (24), it
is clear that the left hand side (a scalar) is invariant so that the forms must
be as well.

R

The ranges of the angles may be inferred by using two assumptions. One
is that the ranges of the angles in the two SU(2) Euler angle sets are the
same as you would expect for the ordinary SU(2) Euler angles. The other has
to do with the volume of the space. We know that SU(3), as a topological
space, is a product of a 3-sphere and a 5-sphere. There is due to a theorem by
H. Hopf that states that compact connected Lie groups has the cohomology
(real coeﬃcients) of a product of odd-dimensional of spheres (see for example

14

[8]). There are few choices for SU(3). It is semi-simple so U(1) is not one
of them. Its dimensionality is 8, and we can pick out an SU(2), which is a
three sphere. Thus we have only a ﬁve sphere remaining. The volume of a
product of two manifolds should be the volume of their product, trivial or
not. (Look at local charts and avoid overlapping.) The volume of a 5-sphere
is π3 and of a 3-sphere is 2π2. Multiplying these and setting that equal to
the integration over the group invariant volume element, and using the ﬁrst
assumption above, one arrives at the following ranges of the angles.

Therefore any function may be integrated over the group.

V Applications

The applications are perhaps endless. Anywhere SU(3) is used, these struc-
tures can provide insight. There are many diﬀerent SU(3)’s in physics, that
is, it is used in several diﬀerent ways. There is, as stated above, the color
gauge group, the approximate ﬂavor symmetry, and the so-called nuclear
SU(3). The latter is based on the shell model and was ﬁrst introduced by
Elliot[9]. The fact that SU(3) is the symmetry group for the 3-d isotropic
harmonic oscillator alone should make for many interesting applications of
this material. With the explicit coordinates and structures derived here
(forms and vector ﬁelds), one should be able to investigate coset spaces of
the group manifold of SU(3) such as SU(3)/U(1) and SU(3)/(U(1)
U(1)).
These manifolds will be given elsewhere and should prove useful for any 3-
d harmonic oscillator potential with the appropriately restricted symmetry.
The manifold SU(3)/U(1)Y , has applications in phenomenological nuclear
interactions through the SU(3) Skyrme-Witten model for meson-baryon in-
teractions as well[10]. Here, the coset space is invariant to right actions
the U(1) corresponding to the hypercharge(Y ). This too will be discussed
elsewhere.

×

Given the explicit bases for left and right invariant vector ﬁelds and forms,
one may construct invariant tensors of arbitrary rank (see for example, [11]).

15

Calculations with these forms and vector ﬁelds might have seemed quite
tedious in the past, given their size. However, they certainly could be used
for computational purposes since they are readily discretized. Also, they may
be manipulated symbolicly using programs such as Mathematica or Maple.
For this purpose, there is a web site under construction with the structures
available for download and immediate use on Mathematica(i.e., formatted
for Mathematica) at http://www.ph.utexas.edu/

There are presented general results of  preceding author’s papers with       
 resumed  contradictions of Landau damping and some simple examples. 
 
Subj-class: Plasma Physics 
 
    The origin of a tremendous amount of works on the propagation and evolution of plasma 
perturbations is the past century work [1], where the problem was formulated as a solution of two 
coupled equations, that is kinetic and Maxwell equations for charged plasma particles. 
    The typical feature of these linearized equations of collisionless plasma is appearance in 
their solutions indefinitely divergent integrals (IDI) with logarithmic divergence. As it is 
known, in the work [1] these integrals were implied in the principal value sense, but eight years 
later ones have taken Landau proposition [2] to imply these integrals as contour integrals with 
xv , where 
xv  is velocity in the 
going out into the complex plane of the real integrand variable 
xv ,  what results in the so-called 
direction of wave propagation, and passing around the pole of 
Landau damping effect, which now has not to be subjected to any doubt and critical discussion. 
     It appears however to be evident that emerging of  IDI in equation solutions is directly a result 
of information lack in the original equations. It means that the sense of  the IDI  must by single way 
follow some additional conditions which are specific for either problem. If one follows this 
principle, strictly speaking, understanding the IDI ad hoc either in the sense of principal value or 
contour integrals becomes arbitrary.  
     The most convenient method of solving wave equations is Laplace transform particularly used in 
[2] for obtaining the asymptotical solution. There follows from the solution constructing itself with 
this method that it satisfies the original equations independently of the IDI-sense. It implies 
multiplicity of solutions which nevertheless all satisfy the original equations, and necessity of some 
additional physical conditions for selection the only solution which merely can make sense in the 
observed physical reality. 
     We have analyzed some simplest modifications of the plane boundary problem with the given 
perturbing boundary electrical field 
simple illustration of questions of principle [3]. It is supposed however for to specify  setting  the 
boundary problem that the electron velocity distribution function is Maxwellian at 
, that is 
either at both transparent sides 
ﬁx
      In this case the additional physical conditions are both absence of back traveling wave of the 
fastest wave mode of solution (owing to the absence of any sources of  reflection or exciting back 
waves in remote parts of homogeneous plasma) and absence of the so-called kinematical waves 
arising at independent of the boundary field excitations of electron distribution function. In the 
plasma of charged particles such waves are impossible without produced by them changes of 
electric field including the already given boundary field, otherwise speaking the given boundary 
field must hard determine the missing boundary values of electron distribution function.

     At propagation of transverse waves there are now two coupled wave modes, the direct fast 
electromagnetic (“usual”) and the low speed electron mode, the last includes slow back electron        
wave. If the waves are excited by a single pulse of  boundary electric field, then an effect arises of 
very weak back response (“echo”), thus its explanation in this problem is not related with Landau 
damping, phase interactions of resonant electron beams (Van Kampen modes) and non-linear wave 
interactions (with nonlinear terms in the original equations) [4].                                                                     
   The single-valued solutions which have been obtained with IDI in the sense of principal value 
satisfy  both the original equations and the abovementioned additional physical conditions. It is 
shown that in the case of the contour IDI-sense these additional physical conditions can not be 
satisfied. 
    As a verifying of Landau damping ones indicate few experiments with the frequency dependence 
of wave decrement resembling Landau prediction. However it ought to note the from initial 
paradoxical character of such experiments: the contradiction between the assumption of 
Maxwellian distribution function which is just setting as a result of collisions (and just with very 
strong dependence of the collision cross-section on electron velocity), and the assumption of 
collisionless plasma. There is shown particularly [5] that at the principal value IDI-sense 
collisionless damping (non-Landau) is possible for the low-speed transversal waves (and 
presumably for the longitudinal slow waves of analogous type) at accounting for slight exceeding 

of the distribution function above the Maxwellian distribution in the tail

.  Such 

experiments are extremely delicate since they demand practically non-realizable conditions for the 
collisionless plasma with Maxwellian distribution function up to high velocity electrons, with ideal 
plasma isolation from the walls, plasma supporting with an external ionizing strong electrical field 
and additional distorting external longitudinal magnetic field, with insufficiently controlled or 
unknown plasma parameters. Stability of discharge column is supported with the energy balance 
at energy losses just due to electron collisions with the walls, and radiation. Amplitude damping 
can also be a result of  wave dispersion [5]. Besides that experimental conditions can be affected by 
the non-Maxwellian (namely half-Maxwellian) distribution function near the plane of applying 
electrical field at 
otherwise than Landau damping. 
    We note in conclusion that owing to quadratic character of the dispersion equation, taking for the 
IDI as contour integrals leads to small imaginary additives to the poles 
 at the real axis 
which shift them to the complex plane. But this means that in the following iteration one ought to 
pass around either pole not in the half-circle [2], but in the full circle [7], what evidences once more 
an arbitrary character of the postulated in [2] rule of calculation IDI.  
     Besides this in the theory [2] there remains unresolved the paradox of inevitable presence of the 
   wave with exponentially growing amplitude, to not account for it there was attracted the so-called

        Nonlinear quadratic in perturbations terms of wave equations in Maxwellian plasma lead to an 
appearance of non-damping overtones with multiple frequencies but not to the wave damping or 
growing at the given boundary field frequency.

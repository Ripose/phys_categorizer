ABOUT LINEAR THRESHOLD OF INSTABILITY
OF FARADAY WAVES IN FLUID COVERED BY THIN FILM

E. Postnikov

The  solution  was  found  from  Navier-Stokes  equation  and  boundary
conditions  with  interfacial  tension  as  function  of  the  film  substance
concentration. Here the method of Chen&Vinals is used. It was found
that adding to coefficient leads to growth of critical value of the driving
acceleration.

The  Faraday  waves  are  the  clear  example  of  self-organization  in  dynamical
systems. See an overview of theoretical and experimental results of studying of this
problem, for example, in [1-3].

There are the theoretical model for description of Faraday waves in case of the
semi-infinite  viscous  fluid  layer  [3]  and  models  for  bounded  depth  [4],  non-
Newtonian liquid [5], two-frequency forced fluids, for example [6, 7]. The surface of
liquid is clear in all these problems.

But there is a problem concerning fluid covered by thin liquid film in Faraday
experiment.  In  known  investigations  one  works  with  running  waves,  as  long
gravitational  [8],  as  short  capillary  [9].  That  makes  hard  experimental  difficulties.
The  measurement  of  the  threshold  of  Faraday  instability  is  simpler  but  also  it  talks
about mechanical and thermodynamical properties of the film.

Let  one  consider  a  semi-infinite  fluid  layer,  unbounded  in  the  x-y  direction,
z =   whet  at  rest.  The  fluid  is
extending  to 
uncompressed and Newtonian, it has density  ρ  and kinematic viscosity  ν . The fluid
is covered by thin (near monomolecular) film with surface concentration  γ .

The existence of the film leads to the growth of critical value of the acceleration.

If 

0=α

  (no  film) 

1=β

  and  (10)  leads  to  known  expression  [3].  After

truncation (11) at the first term one has one mode solution for running wave [8, 9].

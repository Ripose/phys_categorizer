Abstract.  We  consider  a  scenario  that  involves  a  stationary  source  of  acoustic  waves 
located at the origin of the K(XOY) inertial reference frame and a receiver that performs 
the hyperbolic motion at a constant altitude. The observer measures the proper reception 
time of successive wave crests. We investigate its dependence on the propagation speed 
of the wave and on the altitude at which the motion takes place. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
 
In  a  previous  paper  [1]  we  have  studied  a  scenario  that  involves  a 
stationary  source  of  acoustic  waves  and  an  accelerating  observer  who 
measures the period of the oscillations taking place in the wave. The moving 
observer  performed  the  well  known  hyperbolic  motion  [2]  taking  place 
along the line that joins source and observer. 
The scenario we propose now involves a stationary source of acoustic 
 
waves S located at the origin O of its rest frame K(XOY)  and an observer R  
who  performs  the  hyperbolic  motion  at  a  constant  altitude  h  with  constant 
proper acceleration g. We could replace the source with a machine gun [3] 
that  fires  bullets  in  all  directions  in  space  at  different  emission  times  te.  A 
bullet emitted at time te hits the observer R at a reception time tr , both times 
being  displayed  by  the  synchronized  clocks  of  the  K  frame.  Let  u   be  the 
speed of the bullets. Observer R performs the hyperbolic motion

interpreted  as  a  “magic”  time  interval  required  accelerating  an  object  with 
constant acceleration g until it reaches the speed 
 in a non-relativistic 
approach. Let t be the time displayed by a clock of the K frame when R is

When  represented  in  the  world  coordinates  [t,  x/c]  equations  (1)  and  (2) 
correspond 
the  parametric  equations  of  a  conjugate  hyperbola. 
Accordingly this motion is also known as the “hyperbolic motion”. It begins 
at  x  =  +∞,  t  =  −∞  with  V  =  c  when  the  decelerating  object  approaches  the 
origin until it reaches the rest at t = 0 and x0 = c²/g. Thereafter for t > 0 the 
moving object reverse direction receding the origin and accelerating toward 
V  =  c  as  x  (cid:5)+∞,  t  (cid:5)+∞  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  special 
relativity.  A  similar  scenario  that  involves  a  light  source  was  studied  by 
Neutze and Moreau [4].

bullets to reach for the first time the altitude h of the receiver trajectory. We 
illustrate in figure 2 the variation of the two mathematical solutions of (5) as 
function  of  the  emission  time  te  for  β  =  0.2  Th  =  5  and  T  =  1.  This 
representation reveals that it is difficult to select the physically valid solution 
respectively the physically valid range for the mathematical solutions of (5).

To  solve  this  problem  we  transpose  it  in  a  special  world  diagram,  that  we 
previously  elaborated  and  used  for  similar  purposes  in  [1].  For  this  we 
calculate  and  represent  the  world  line  of  the  virtual  point  W(xw,t) 
representing  the  intersection  between  the  circular  wave-front  of  the 
propagating acoustic signal and the receiver trajectory at y = h.

Further conclusions result after depicting the world line of the accelerating 
receiver (WLR) and the word line of the W point (WLW) in a common world 
diagram.  Figure  5  provides  valuable  information  for  selecting  and  limiting 
the  range  of  the  physically  valid  solutions.  We  depicted  two  emission-
receptions events. A first conclusion is that the reception is possible only if 
the  emission  time  te  is  negative,  which  means  that  the  receiver  was 
approaching  the  source  at  the  emission  time.  If  the  source  emits  at  te  >0 
when the receiver is receding the source then the reception is not possible at 
all. Therefore we shall eliminate the right side of the plots in figure 2; only 
the left side plots are physically valid.

possible only for early emissions taking place in the approaching phase.   

 
Furthermore, when following the world lines in figure 5 we distinguish the 
following  characteristic  situations  depending  on  the  values  of  u/c  and 
emission time: 
-  WLW  doesn’t  intersect  WLR  at  all  and  thus  no  information  exchange 
between source and receiver takes place, 
- WLW is tangent to WLR (

  respectively.  In  this 
-  WLW  intersects  WLR  twice  at  the  times 
case  both  solutions  given  by  (5)  are  valid,  which  means  that  the  acoustic 
wave-front intercepts the accelerating receiver twice. If the stationary source 
  then  the  approaching 
emits  periodical  signals  at  time  instants 
observer  R  receives  these  signals  (bullets  or  the  wave  crests)  in  the 
  and  thereafter  he  receives  the

their  validity  range  we  depict  in  figure  6  the  variation  of  reception  times 
with the emission time te for different values of Th = h/c.

If  the  source  emits  periodically  very  short  audio  signals  at  time  instants 
 then the accelerating observer receives the Nth light signal when

.  The  nonlinearities  we  notice  in  figure  6  and  7 
suggest  that  the  proper  emission  period  and  with  it  the  Doppler  factor 
defined as the quotient of  proper reception and proper emission periods will 
reveal  some  oscillations  similar  to  the  one  we  found  in  the  optic  case  [5]. 
These oscillations become further significant as h or β increases. 
 
 
6. Conclusions 
We have revealed some peculiarities of the acoustic Doppler Effect in 
 
the non-longitudinal case. In order to be more intuitive we have shown that 
we  can  replace  the  source of  acoustic  waves  with a  machine  gun  that  fires 
successive bullets in all directions in space. Our approach illustrates the non-
locality in the period measurement by an accelerating observer. 
 
From  a  pedagogical  point  of  view  our  approach  teaches  the  student 
how  to  put  in  equations  a  given  physical  scenario  and  how  to  distinguish 
between  the  solutions  with  physical  meaning,  encouraging  the  use  of 
computer in order to visualise the derived solutions.

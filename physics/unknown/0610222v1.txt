Abstract 
 
A light-weight "inflatable" tensioned-membrane-structure vacuum container is proposed and its 
stability is analyzed.  The proposed structure consists of a pressurized lobed cylindrical "wall" 
surrounding a central evacuated space.  Stability is analyzed by discretizing the system and 
diagonalizing the second derivative of the potential energy.  The structure is found to be stable 
when the pressure in the wall is greater than a critical pressure.  When membranes are non-
elastic, the critical pressure is found to be greater than the pressure required for equilibrium by a 
factor of 4/3.  When membranes have only finite stiffness, a first order correction to the critical 
pressure is found.  Preliminary experimental data shows that a stable structure can be made in 
this way, and that observed critical pressure is consistent with theory.  It is also found that such 
structures may have net positive buoyancy in air. 
 
Introduction 
 
A structurally stable vacuum container that is of minimal total mass for a given evacuated 
volume might have applications in airship design (buoyancy control) [1], aerospace (low 
aerodynamic drag magnetic levitation launch systems) [2], industry (large industrial vacuum 
chambers), transportation (supersonic maglev trains) [2], and solar energy production (solar 
chimney technology) [3].  Unfortunately, issues of structural stability are often overwhelming in 
the design of such a structure. 
 
The history of lightweight vacuum containers is somewhat disconnected.  Von Guericke created 
the first artificial vacuum around 1654 [4].  Traditional containers were thick heavy shells, the 
thickness being required to give sufficient stability to prevent buckling.  In 1878, Tracy patented 
an "aircraft" that aimed to derive lift from the buoyancy of a vacuum enclosed in an unstable 
light-weight container [5].  In 1921, Armstrong patented another such craft that claimed to 
stabilize its vacuum volume in an in-fact unstable inflated tensioned shell [6].  More recently, 
Michaelis and Forbes have discussed the basic forces required to achieve equilibrium (not 
stability) in a tensional vacuum vessel and have proposed the light-weight or weightless 
inflatable vacuum chamber [7].  Lennon and Pellegrino have discussed the stability of inflated 
structures [8] however a stability analysis of an inflated vacuum vessel (the purpose of the 
current work) has not been carried out. 
 
In the current work we propose an axially symmetric "cylindrical" structure composed of a 
"wall" surrounding a central evacuated volume.  The wall consists of pressurized regions within 
a network of tensioned membranes.  Rigorous stability analysis is carried out by (a) discretizing 
the degrees of freedom of the system, (b) forming the matrix which represents the second

derivative of the potential energy with respect to these degrees of freedom, and (c) diagonalizing 
the matrix to confirm positive-definiteness and, hence, stability.  The proposed structure is found 
to be stable when sufficiently pressurized.  Judicious choice of membrane materials and 
pressurizing gas can lead to a structure that has over half of its total volume completely 
evacuated and net positive buoyancy in air. 
 
The Proposed Structure and its Modeling 
 

 

Figure 1, general cross-section of the proposed structure.  The wall of the structure is composed 
of membranes under tension (solid lines) containing pressurized gas (heavily hatched area).  The 
wall encloses the evacuated space at the center (unhatched area) isolating that space from the 
ambient pressure (lightly hatched area).  Rin, Rout, and N are the inner radius, outer radius, and 
number of sections respectively. 
 
We wish to analyze the stability of the structure depicted in Figure 1.  The structure is axially 
symmetric and of uniform cross-section, i.e. invariant under translations in the direction 
perpendicular to the plane of the drawing.  We will analyze the most general form of this system 
having N sections (N=64 in Fig. 1) and having an outside tension hoop of vertex radius R (where 
the vertex radius of the inside tension hoop is taken to be the unit of length).  (R=1.4 in Fig. 1.)  
The central vacuum will be assumed to be "complete" (absolute pressure of exactly zero 
atmospheres).  The absolute pressure within the wall is P in units of the ambient pressure 
(atmospheres). 
 
In order to analyze the equilibrium and stability of the system, we must write its potential energy 
U as a function of configuration or deformation.  We characterize the configuration of the system 
by coordinates xni  specifying the radial and circumferential displacements of the N inside 

2006-09-06, Barton, page 2 of 12 

Stability Analysis of an Inflatable Vacuum Chamber 

vertices and the N outside vertices according to the convention established in Figure 2.  Thus xni 
= 0 characterizes the nominal, intended, or undeformed configuration, which corresponds to an 
extremum (local minimum, local maximum, or saddle point) in the total potential energy for any 
given value of P.  One then writes U as a function of these xni.  For equilibrium (or instantaneous 
balance of forces), one need only confirm that the first derivatives of U with respect to the xni are 
all zero.  For stability, the second derivative of U with respect to any and all linear combinations 
of the xni must be non-negative.  Third and higher-order derivatives are neglected in stability 
analysis as displacements are assumed to be small.  For this reason our representation of U need 
be valid only to second order about the nominal configuration. 
 

Figure 2, definition of the 4N degrees of freedom of the structure xni 
 
In order to write an expression for U, we consider the forms of potential energy that the system 
possesses.  The system consists of two types of potential energy, "solid-elastic" energy and 
"pressure-volume" energy.  Each tensioned membrane has a solid-elastic energy of the form

l∆  is the change in length of the membrane relative to the equilibrium configuration, F is 
l∆  

where 
the pretensioning, and K is the elastic constant.  This equation is valid only to second order in 
and thus the representation of 
l∆  need be valid only to second order in the xni.  To achieve 
equilibrium, F will be different for different membranes and since the elastic constant of a 
membrane K depends on its length, thickness, and elastic modulus, K will also be different for 
different membranes. 
 
Each volume under pressure has a pressure-volume energy of the form 
(2) 
∆
where P is the pressure in the volume and ∆V is the change in volume relative to the equilibrium 
configuration.  In order for this equation to be valid to second order in ∆V, one must make the 
simplifying assumption that the pressure  P  is constant during any change in volume.  Thus, we 
assume we are connected to a large reservoir that maintains constant pressure.  If this is not true, 
pressure can increase with a decrease in volume thus enhancing stability.  This assumption can 
lead to a false conclusion that the system is unstable but can never lead to a false conclusion that

l∆ , the representation 

the system is stable.  We call this a "stability-safe" assumption.  As with 
of ∆V must be valid to second order in the xni. 
 
To simplify the form of U, we note that all pairs of circumferential nearest-neighbor vertices are 
connected by a curved membrane and a straight membrane that enclose a pseudo-semicylindrical 
volume.  The solid-elastic energy of these two membranes and the pressure-volume energy of the 
enclosed space are all determined only by the distance between the pair of vertices.  Thus there is 
no need to represent these energies separately in U as they can be absorbed into single 
hypothetical "spring" with an "effective" pretensioning F and an "effective" elastic constant K 
(see a, α, b, and β in Fig. 3). 
 
Furthermore, we assume that there is an infinitesimal clearance angle between the curved 
membranes so that we need not consider their interference with each other.  If they were to 
interfere, stability would be enhanced as this is an additional constraint on the system.  Again 
this is a "stability safe" assumption.

Stability Analysis 
 
The ∆l's and the ∆V's are written as polynomials in the xni retaining terms up to second order.  
These polynomials are inserted into the general forms of ∆Umembrane and ∆Ugas to give U which 
we write as a power series in

as shown by Michaelis and Forbes [7].  (Note that, while it is true that the pretensioning in a 
membrane cannot be negative, no such restriction applies to an effective tension; for example, 
the effective tension b is often negative.)  Furthermore we wish to explore only infinitesimal 
deformations about the equilibrium position and thus terms third order in

analyzing the geometry of the idealized system (Fig. 3), one can determine the matrix elements 
of Gij and Jij.  For example G00 is the self-coupling elastic constant for any inside node moving in 
the radial direction.  This takes major contributions from the elastic constant of the radial 
membrane γ and the tension in the inside tension hoop a.  It can be show that

kijK′ , we will assume that all of the elastic 

constants (α, β, and γ) are large compared to the other variables (A, B, C, P, and Q).  This 
approximation is often valid for inflatable structures because the "effective" elastic modulus (or 
Young's modulus) of a diatomic gas is only 1.4 times its "effective" yield strength (or pressure).  
This is in contrast to solids which often have an elastic modulus several orders of magnitude 
larger than their yield strengths.  Thus compared to gases, solids are "stiff".  The same 
approximation was made by Lennon and Pellegrino in their analysis [8].  We will call this the 
"stiff solid" approximation.  We will later remove this approximation to find a first-order 
correction.  We know that α, β, and γ must give positive contributions to the eigenvalues as they 
represent springs with only positive spring constants.  Thus, in the limit that they are large, our 
only hope of finding a negative eigenvalue will be to look in the null space of the α, β, and γ 
terms. 
 
Now neglecting A, B, C, P, and Q terms and considering only α, β, and γ terms in K'kij, we have 
K''kij.  A simple analysis indicates that K''kij has exactly one null vector (unnormalized)

Thus we have found two potentially unstable modes for k=0 and one for every other k for a total 
of N+1 modes allowed within the "stiff solid" approximation.  The remaining 3N-1 modes have 
eigenvalues going to positive infinity in the "stiff solid" approximation and are thus stable and 
uninteresting.  We are interested only in the N+1 modes in which the elastic constants α, β, and γ 
do not contribute to the eigenvalue and thus the stability is governed by the pressure and the 
vacuum.  It is in this N+1 dimensional space that we expect to find the N+1 non-infinite energy 
eigenmodes of the system.  For k=0 which allows more than one mode, we must again 
diagonalize in that two-dimensional subspace to find the eigenmodes.  We thus operate the K'kij 
(including the A, B, C, P, and Q terms) onto these null eigenvectors of K''kij to determine if their 
eigenvalues (considering all terms) are positive or negative.  One need not normalize the vectors 
in order to simply determine the sign of the eigenvalue. 
 
In the basis of the two k=0 modes allowed in the "stiff solid" approximation, the matrix elements 
of K'kij are

The determinant of this matrix is found to be zero and the trace is found to be positive indicating 
one zero eigenvalue and one positive eigenvalue.  (The zero eigenvalue corresponds to overall 
rotation of the system.)  We continue with the remaining N-1 k values in search of the mode of 
greatest instability.  By operating K'kij on the remaining null eigenvectors of K''kij (where k does 
not equal 0) we find that the sign of the eigenvalues are determined by the sign of

combinations of these two modes correspond to overall translation of the system along global "x"

Taking first and second derivatives of this with respect to k, it is quickly found that it is most 
negative when k=2 or N-2.  And so the greatest possibility of making the eigenvalue less than 
zero is for the modes k=2 and k=N-2.  Hence these are always the most unstable modes and thus 
they determine the overall stability of the system.  The geometry of these modes is shown in Fig.

From this it is seen that a maximum C enhances stability and thus reducing tension in the outer

assume that C takes its minimum value (4).  This leads to an expression for stability in terms of

The right side of eq. (12) goes to 4/3 in the small θ limit (many sections or large N), and does not

Notice that the requirement for stability (13) compared to that of equilibrium (5) is to simply 
increase the absolute pressure by factor 4/3.  This analysis depends on the "stiff solid" 
approximation.  Let us now reexamine that approximation. 
 
In the limit that R goes to unity, the structure must fail as the solid components of the system 
have only finite stiffness, but because we have assumed that the elastic constants are very large, 
we do not see this in the current result (13).  To understand when this failure may occur, we must 
go back and find the critical P that makes 

 positive semidefinite without assuming that α, β, 

2ijK ′

and γ are large.  To arrive at the smallest possible values for α, β, and γ, we will assume that 
every membrane is only thick enough to just meet its strength requirement.  We further assume 
that membranes comprising the outer and inner tension hoops are of equal thickness and only of 
sufficient strength to withstand venting of the chamber.  Given a ratio of elastic modulus to yield 
strength M, these assumptions determine the elastic constant of every membrane.  We insert 
these explicit forms of α, β, and γ into 
.  We will still assume that θ is small (a "stability 

2ijK ′

safe" assumption) and thus expand each element of 

 in a power series in θ keeping only the 

2ijK ′

leading non-zero term.  For every non-zero element this is the term first-order in θ.  We then 
explicitly set the determinant to zero to find the critical P,

If we take the limit that M is large by only considering the third order term in M, we find that this 

determinant equals zero when

For an example case where R=1.4 and M=65 (typical for carbon fiber), we find that ∆P/P≈13% 
(16).  A numerical solution of eq. (14) in the same case gives ∆P/P=15%. 
 
Preliminary Experimental Data 
 
A model was constructed of polyester film bonded with acrylic adhesive having R=2 and N=12 
(see Figure 5).  The pressure in the wall of the structure was raised above atmospheric pressure 
by 1.01±0.10 psi (6.96±0.69 kPa).  Partial evacuation of the central volume was then begun.  
Stability was maintained until the central pressure reached 0.72±0.10 psi (4.96±0.69 kPa) below 
atmospheric pressure.  At this point the central volume began to decrease by means of the k=2 
deformation, thus preventing further reduction in pressure even though pumping continued.  
Pressure in the wall of the structure was then raised to 2.0 psi (13.8 kPa) above atmospheric 
pressure, however before another measurement could be made an internal failure of the acrylic 
adhesive redistributed stresses to rupture the exterior film and hence the pressure was lost.  The 
model was not repaired. 
 
Though the central vacuum was not complete, the structure responds only to differences in 

pressure, thus the one data point obtained has the same stability as

Stability Analysis of an Inflatable Vacuum Chamber 

Given N=12 and R=2 and knowing the bounds on C (4), the theory predicts the critical P 
required for stability between 2.27 and 2.55 (11) which is consistent with this observation.

Application of Theory 
 
To apply this theory to achieve a structure that is lighter than air, careful consideration is 
required.  A simple analysis shows that these types of structures contain at least twice as many 
moles of pressurized gas as the moles of gas displaced [7].  Thus pressurizing with air can never 
lead to a structure that is lighter-than-air.  Additionally one should note that, if a particular design 
is found to possess sufficient strength to transmit the required forces when evacuated, these 
forces can increase when the chamber is vented (especially in the tension hoops) leading to 
failure of the system unless P is simultaneously reduced.  However, if pressurization is 
accomplished with helium, and membranes are constructed of advanced materials such as 
Kevlar- or carbon-fiber composites, calculations show that such a structure could be lighter-than-
air with over half of its volume completely evacuated and still resist failure when vented.  For 
example, if R≈1.4 and the structure is constructed of 60% carbon fiber/40% polyester composite 
with a safety factor of unity and pressurized with helium, it will have a total mass about one third 
the mass of air it displaces while (with sufficiently large N) over half of its total volume is 
completely evacuated.

If net positive buoyancy is not necessary, more basic materials and pressurized air could be used 
while still reducing the required amount of raw material by about two orders of magnitude 
compared to conventional chamber designs. 
 
Future Directions 
 
Preliminary analysis indicates that the structure of Figure 1 can be modified to further enhance 
stability and ease of fabrication.  While both of the modified structures shown in Fig. 6 appear to 
have greater stability, the greatest stability appears to be found in the structure of Fig. 6(a).  The 
structure of Fig. 6(b), however, appears to be easier to fabricate.  Rigorous stability analysis of 
these structures appears to be more complex than that of the current model and has not yet been 
carried out.

Nomenclature 
 
As the structure is of uniform cross-section, we are analyzing it only in two dimensions and thus 
all values are per unit length in the third dimension. 
 
xni is the displacement of the ith degree of freedom in the nth unit cell. 
c and γ are the pretensioning F and elastic constant K of one radial membrane respectively. 
a and α are the effective pretensioning F and effective elastic constant K of one segment of the 
inside tension hoop respectively. 
b and β are the effective pretensioning F and effective elastic constant K of one segment of the 
outside tension hoop respectively. 
P is the absolute pressure in the pressurized regions.  (The absolute ambient pressure is taken to 
be the unit pressure.)

R is the vertex radius of the outside tension hoop.  (The vertex radius of the inside tension hoop 
is taken to be the unit length.) 
U is the potential energy of the system. 
N is the multiplicity of the axial symmetry.  (The system has N-fold axial symmetry.)

In this report, we show that a photon inside a waveguide can be localized in the same sense that 

a  massive  particle  can  be  localized  in  free  space,  and  just  as  that  it  is  impossible  to  localize  a 

massive particle with a greater precision than its Compton wavelength, one cannot localize a photon 

inside a waveguide with a greater precision than its equivalent Compton wavelength, which owing 

to evanescent-wave or photon-tunneling phenomena.

It has been proved that there is no self-adjoint position operator in the state space of 

the  photon  [1-2],  which  is  taken  to  indicate  that  photons  are  not  localizable  at  all.   

However, both possible theoretical objections and the experiment itself seem to reject such 

a  radical  interpretation  of  the  mentioned  results  [3-14].  In  fact,  the  conclusion  of  the 

nonlocalizability of the photon is disappointed from the perspective of quantum optics, and 

is hardly acceptable because it conflicts with our findings in laboratories [4]. For example, 

the optical resolution problem  cannot be understood unless the spatial photon localization 

problem is addressed. What is more, some recent studies have shown that photons can be 

localized in space [11-13], where the Ref. [12] has shown that photons can be localized in 

space  with  an  exponential  falloff  of  the  energy  density  and  photon  detection  rate. 

Consequently, in spite of the well-known conclusion that single photon cannot be localized, 

there  have  been  many  attempts  to  introduce  the  concept  of  photon  wave  function  and 

reconstruct  a  first  and  second  quantization  description  of  the  photon  [3-9],  and  a  photon 

position  operator  with  commuting  components  has  been  constructed  [10].  Nowadays,  a 

 

1

fresh interest in the photon localization problem has been awakened, meeting the needs of 

developments in near-field optics, cavity QED, and quantum computing. 

In  this  report,  we  shall  investigate  the  localization  of  photons  inside  a  waveguide  (a 

rectangular  waveguide  without  loss  of  generality).  In  the  following  we  apply  the  natural 

units  of  measurement  (

As  we  know,  when  a  particle  is  confined  to  a  small  region,  nonrelativistic  quantum 

mechanics  may  become  no  longer  valid.  Therefore,  the  concept  of  localizability  in 

nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is just an ideal one, and there has a common property for 

the localizability of all massive particles: it is impossible to localize a particle with a greater 

precision than its Compton wavelength, which owing to many-particle phenomena.   

In practice, an interaction is necessary to locate a particle. In all the electromagnetism 

techniques, an interaction between photons and the related apparatuses is inevitable. These 

interactions include that of confining photons to a spatial region, where the dimension of the 

region can be 1, 2, or 3. As an example, we shall show that the photons inside a waveguide 

can be localized in the same sense that a massive particle can be localized in free space.

  without  loss  of  generality.  The  conductivity  of  the 

metal pipe is assumed to be infinite. It is also assumed that the waveguide is infinitely long 

and the source of the electromagnetic field is localized at infinity. The pipe is considered as 

a  boundary  which  confines  the  waves  to  the  enclosed  space.  When  the  electromagnetic 

waves propagate along the direction of the waveguide, they are reflected back and forth by 

perfectly conducting walls in the empty inner space of the pipe. For simplicity, we assume 

that the photons inside the waveguide correspond to a given eigenmode of the waveguide, 

and  have  4-momentum

this is closely analogous to that of a material (massive) particle. Then, the cutoff frequency 

cω , as the vertical-motion energy of the photons inside the waveguide, plays the role of rest

mass.  Moreover,  in  the  coordinate  system

represents the momentum of the photons along the direction of the waveguide, while the 3D 

vector 

Tk

  is perpendicular to 

p   and then represents transverse momentum, it contributes 

the apparent mass 

m

  to the photons in such a way:

That  is,  the  constraint  on  the  motion  of  the  photons  in  the  transverse  direction  of  the 

waveguide gives rise to an equivalent mass to the photons.   

Furthermore, the group velocity (denoted by

of the photons inside the waveguide are, respectively (

In  fact,  inside  the  waveguide,  the  group  velocity 

  of  the  photons  can  be  viewed  as  a

relative velocity between an observer and the photons with the apparent mass 

m ω=

.

From  Eqs.  (9)-(11),  one  can  show  that  there  exists  a  closely  analogy  between  the 

behaviors of the de Broglie matter waves and those of the electromagnetic waves inside a 

waveguide.  In  fact,  the  similarity  between  the  dispersion  relation  of  matter  waves  for 

material  (massive)  particles  and  that  of  electromagnetic  waves  inside  the  waveguide  has 

been mentioned before [15-16].     

To  discuss  these  rigorously  and  generally,  we  are  suggested  by  the  concept  of  the 

apparent mass and Eq. (7), and define the apparent 4-momentum of the photons inside the 

waveguide as 

k

μ ≡

,  which  describes  the 

motion  along  the  direction  perpendicular  to  the  apparent  four-momentum

way, we obtain an orthogonal decomposition for the 4-momentum of the photons inside the 

waveguide as follows:

4-vectors  can  be  orthogonally  decomposed  as  the  sum  of  a  space-like  4-vector  and  a 

time-like 4-vector. As for the photons inside the waveguide, the time-like 4-momentum 

Lk μ 

representing  their  apparent  4-momentum,  can  be  called  the  active  part  of  kμ,  or  the 

kinematics  part  of  kμ;  while  the  space-like  4-momentum 

Tk μ  contributing  the  apparent 

mass  term,  can  be  called  the  frozen  part  of  kμ,  or  the  stationary-wave  part  of  kμ.  In  a 

word,  the  constraint  on  the  motion  of  the  photons  in  the  transverse  direction  of  the 

waveguide  gives  rise  to  an  apparent  mass  to  the  photons,  that  is,  the  apparent  mass  term

arises by freezing out the degrees of freedom corresponding to the transverse 4-momentum 

Tk μ.     

Now,  from  the  point  of  view  of  4D  space-time,  we  shall  give  a  description  of  the 

electromagnetic waveguide theory in a Lorentz covariant formulation. As discussed before, 

in the Cartesian coordinate system

boundary conditions for the waveguide, the photons in the free space inside the waveguide 

should obey the Maxwell equations, or, the Dirac-like equation    [17]

That  is,  the  photons  in  the  free  space  inside  the  waveguide  satisfy  the  new  Dirac-like 

equation  (16)  and  the  Klein-Gordon  equation  (17),  where  the  cutoff  frequency 

m ω=
c

 

plays the role of rest mass. Therefore, inside the waveguide, the electromagnetic waves for 

photons  become  a  concept  analogous  to  that  of  the  matter  waves  for  material  (massive) 

particles, which can be shown further by Eqs. (7)-(11). This implies that the photons inside 

the waveguide may be localized in the usual sense that a massive particle can be localized 

in free space.     

In fact, there has another way of looking at the discussions above. In detail, we shall 

show that, what we discuss above provides a physical model for the theory presented in Ref. 

[18].  In  Ref.  [18]  the  authors  have  introduced  quantum  observables  describing  the 

space-time  position  of  the  physical  event  defined  by  the  intersection  of  two  light  pulses, 

where the conformal-transformation generators (related to conformal symmetry of massless 

quantum  fields)  is  used  first  to  build  the  definition  of  there  space-time  observables,  by 

which the connection between the definition of an observable space-time position and the 

massive character of the state has been obtained a simple physical interpretation.     

As we know, on the one hand, the TEM mode (both the electric and magnetic fields 

perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  propagation)  cannot  propagate  in  a  single  conductor 

transmission line, only those modes in the form of transverse electric (TE) and transverse 

magnetic (TM) modes can propagate in the waveguide. On the other hand, however, there 

has another useful way of looking at the propagation [16, 19], that is, the waveguide field 

can be viewed as the superposition of two sets of plane waves (i.e., the TEM waves) being 

continually  reflected  back  and  forth  between  perfectly  conducting  walls  and  zigzagging

down  the  waveguide.  The  two  sets  of  plane  waves  have  the  same  amplitudes  and 

frequencies,  but  reverse  phases.  Namely,  for  a  given  wall  of  the  waveguide,  if  one  set  of 

plane  waves  correspond  to  the  incident  waves,  then  another  to  the  reflected  wave  (a 

reflection means reversal of phase). Let 

1k μ   and 

2k μ  denote the 4-momemnta of the two 

sets of plane waves, respectively, one has, obviously

where the factor of 4 presents no problem, because once the waveguide field is expressed as 

the superposition of two sets of plane waves, its amplitude is halved. Eq. (18) implies that, 

with the aid of the Poincaré algebra one can construct the position operator of the photons 

inside the waveguide, in the same sense that the position operator of a massive particle can 

be  constructed.  The  detailed  discussions  are  similar  to  those  presented  in  Ref.  [18]. 

However, in contrast with Ref. [18], here one can show that, not only the presence of the 

two photons propagating in different directions, but also the superposition of two different 

wave-vector states of a single photon, allow one to introduce the definition of a localized 

event. The second case is due to the presence of the apparent mass of the photons inside the 

waveguide.   

  As  mentioned  before,  there  has  a  common  property  for  the  localizability  of  all 

massive  particles:  it  is  impossible  to  localize  a  particle  with  a  greater  precision  than  its 

Compton wavelength, which owing to many-particle phenomena. Likewise, in terms of the 

concept of the apparent mass 

m ω=
c

, one can define the equivalent Compton wavelength 

of the photons inside the waveguide (

Similarly,  as  for  the  localizability  of  the  photons  inside  the  waveguide,  one  can  arrival  at 

such a conclusion: it is impossible to localize a photon inside a waveguide with a greater 

precision  than  its  equivalent  Compton  wavelength,  which  owing  to  evanescent-wave  or 

photon-tunneling phenomena. For example, assume that a photon inside a waveguide lies in 

a  given  mode  of  the  waveguide,  if  one  tries  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  cross  section  of  the 

waveguide  and  obtain  a  new  waveguide,  so  as  to  localize  the  photon  within  the  cross 

section with a greater precision than its equivalent Compton wavelength, then there always 

exists an inertial reference frame in which the photon’s frequency is smaller than the cutoff 

frequency of the new waveguide, this shows that the photon-tunneling phenomenon would 

take  place.  In  fact,  here  we  have  given  another  way  of  looking  at  the  relation  between 

optical tunneling and photon localizability, which has been discussed in Ref. [20].

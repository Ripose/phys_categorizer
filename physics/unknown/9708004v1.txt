Abstract

We study in detail the bound state spectrum of the generalized Morse poten-
tial (GMP), which was proposed by Deng and Fan as a potential function for diatomic
molecules. By connecting the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation with the Laplace
equation on the hyperboloid and the Schr¨odinger equation for the P¨oschl-Teller poten-
tial, we explain the exact solvability of the problem by an so(2, 2) symmetry algebra,
su(1, 1). We prove that
and obtain an explicit realization of the latter as su(1, 1)
some of the so(2, 2) generators connect among themselves wave functions belong-
ing to diﬀerent GMP’s (called satellite potentials). The conserved quantity is some
combination of the potential parameters instead of the level energy, as for potential
algebras. Hence, so(2, 2) belongs to a new class of symmetry algebras. We also stress
the usefulness of our algebraic results for simplifying the calculation of Frank-Condon
factors for electromagnetic transitions between rovibrational levels based on diﬀerent
electronic states.

1 Introduction

It is well known that the factorization method of Infeld and Hull [1], the algebraic approach
of Alhassid et al [2, 3, 4, 5], and/or the SUSYQM superalgebraic scheme for shape-invariant

potentials [6] allow one to connect with one another wave functions Ψ(m) corresponding to

a set of potentials V (m), m = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The wave functions Ψ(m) satisfy the Schr¨odinger

equations

¯h2
2µ

d2
dx2 + V (m)(x)

#

"−

Ψ(m)(x) = EΨ(m)(x)

(1.1)

with the same energy eigenvalue E. In the factorization method, the connections between

these functions are given by the relations

H (±)Ψ(m)(x) = Ψ(m±1)(x)

(1.2)

where H (±) are m-dependent, ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators. Explicit expressions for the
ladder operators H (±) were found in [1] for various types of potentials.

In the algebraic approach [2, 3, 4, 5], the m-dependence of the ladder operators is

eliminated by introducing some auxiliary variables, so that the resulting operators coincide

with the generators of some algebra G (G = su(2), so(2, 1), so(2, 2), etc). A deﬁnite

irreducible representation (irrep) Dw of G is realized in the space of wave functions Ψ(m).

The number of interconnected functions Ψ(m) (and corresponding potentials V (m)) can be

ﬁnite (m

n

≤

−

1, where n is the dimension of the irrep Dw of the compact algebra G) or

inﬁnite (Dw belongs to the discrete series of unitary irreps of the noncompact algebra G).

SUSYQM provides an alternative algebraization of the factorization method, wherein
the ladder operators give rise to supercharge operators Q± [6, 7]. Together with the super-

symmetric Hamiltonian, the latter generate an su(1/1) superalgebra.

A common feature of the various approaches [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ?] is the fact that taking
some initial potential V (i), one can construct a set of potentials V (0), V (1), . . ., V (i−1),

V (i+1), . . ., associated with it.

If V (i) has a ﬁnite number of levels (bound states) E(i)
s ,

s = 0, 1, . . ., l, then the potential V (m) (m < i) has the same levels E(i)
s

except for i

−

of them, i.e., s = 0, 1, . . ., l

i + m. The corresponding wave functions of such potentials,

−

2

which may be called satellite potentials, are connected by eq. (1.2). In [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], it

was assumed that the level energy E is constant (in [2, 3, 4, 5], E is unambigously connected
with the irrep signature w). Applying the algebra G generators H (±) on a state belonging to

a potential of this set gives rise to a state belonging to another satellite potential. Therefore

the algebra G was called the potential algebra [2], or the algebra describing the ﬁxed energy

states of a family of systems with quantized coupling constants [5].

In the present paper, we consider a potential suggested by Deng and Fan in 1957 [8] to

describe diatomic molecular energy spectra and electromagnetic transitions, and referred

to as the generalized Morse potential (GMP). As the standard one [9],

V (x) = D[1

2
e−a(x−xe)]

−

(1.3)

where D, a, and xe are some constants, it has the advantage of automatically including some

anharmonicity eﬀects, while admitting an exact analytical solution, allowing one to easily

calculate various molecular characteristics. In contrast, it has none of the three well-known

limitations of the Morse potential, namely (i) to be deﬁned in the interval

whereas higher order terms are needed for a good description of the vibrational levels of

some diatomic molecules [8]. The GMP therefore provides an interesting alternative to

some recent attempts to eliminate the Morse potential defects, based on computer calcula-

Our aim is to explain the exact solvability of the GMP by determining its symmetry

algebra. For such a purpose, it will prove convenient to relate the Schr¨odinger equation

for the GMP to other equations with known symmetry algebras, namely the Laplace equa-

tion on the hyperboloid [11], and the Schr¨odinger equation for the P¨oschl-Teller poten-

tions [10].

tial (PTP) [5].

The GMP symmetry algebra, resulting from such connections, will turn out to be dis-

tinct from the potential algebras, and to belong to a new class of symmetry algebras,
wherein the operators (generators) H (±) connect with one another wave functions Ψ(m)(x)

satisfying the equations

¯h2
2µ

d2
dx2 + V (m)(x)

#

"−

Ψ(m)(x) = E(m)Ψ(m)(x)

(1.5)

with m-dependent eigenvalues E(m). Contrary to the case of eq. (1.1), the conserved (con-

stant) quantity for the set of satellite potentials V (0), V (1), . . ., V (m), . . . will not be the

level energy E, but some combination f (am) of the potential parameters am:

f (am) = constant.

(1.6)

One may still consider some ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators H (±) connecting the wave

functions of neighbouring satellite potentials, and satisfying eq. (1.2). They are similar to

those of the factorization method [1], except for the fact that they do not conserve the

energy eigenvalue E. Under certain conditions, which are fulﬁlled for the GMP, they may

generate some algebra G, associated with the satellite potentials. In this algebraic case,

the wave functions Ψ(m)(x), m = 0, 1, . . ., form a basis of an irrep Dw of the algebra G

and its signature w is connected with the constant f (am) of eq. (1.6). Such an approach

therefore allows one to construct a set of satellite potentials V (m) (m = 0, 1, 2, . . .), which

are diﬀerent in the general case from potentials produced by the factorization method [1],

by potential algebras [2, 3, 4, 5], or by SUSYQM [6, 7].

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the GMP is reviewed, and its bound

state spectrum and corresponding normalized wave functions are given.

Its connections

with the Laplace operator on the hyperboloid and with the P¨oschl-Teller potential (PTP)

are established in section 3, and used in section 4 to construct a symmetry algebra so(2, 2)

related to the new type of satellite potentials. Some concluding remarks are given in

section 5.

It is not a trivial matter to derive a closed expression for the normalization coeﬃcient Nn

of the eigenfunctions (2.16), which was not given in [8]. As shown in the appendix, this can

most easily be done by using SUSYQM techniques. The result can be rewritten as

Nn =

a(αn + n + l)Γ(2αn + n + 1)Γ(2αn + n + 2l)

Making an expansion of (2.15) in terms of powers of (n + 1/2), we get [8]

where ǫ(0), ǫ(1), ǫ(2), and ǫ(3) are coeﬃcients depending on the parameters of the potential

function. This means that the GMP includes terms of arbitrary order in the Dunham

expansion.

It is easy to verify that all corrections ǫ(k)

given in eq. (1.4).

On the other hand, using the well-known limit relation between Gauss and conﬂuent

hypergeometric functions 2F1(a, b, c; z/b)

→ 1F1(a, c; z), when b

→ ∞

(or re ≫

1) [13], and

considering the region r

1, we obtain that the GMP eigenfunctions (2.16) can be reduced

to those of the Morse potential.

The interrelation between the Morse potential and the GMP is illustrated in Fig.1. It

is clear that for rather large values of re (a = 1), these potentials are very close to each

other in the regions r

re and r > re. However, they are very diﬀerent at r

0. If both

by a harmonic oscillator potential with frequency ¯hω = ǫ(1) (see eq. (2.20)).

Usually, the existence of an exact analytical solution of the Schr¨odinger equation for

some system can be explained by the fact that the corresponding Hamiltonian has some

symmetry algebra. In the next two sections, we shall proceed to determine the latter for

the GMP.

3 Connections with the Laplace operator on the hy-

perboloid and the P¨oschl-Teller potential

As well known,

in order to ﬁnd the symmetry algebra related to a one-dimensional

Schr¨odinger equation, it is useful to map the latter into a problem in a higher-dimensional

7

space. For instance, by using some transformation, Alhassid et al [2] were able to map the

Schr¨odinger equation for the Morse potential into a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator.

Following this line of thought, we will embed our one-dimensional GMP problem into

a three-dimensional space. Namely, we will show below that the Schr¨odinger equation for

the GMP can be connected with the Laplace-Beltrami-Casimir one on the four-dimensional

hyperboloid deﬁned by

whose symmetry algebra is so(2, 2).

Using the Casimir operator of this algebra, we will derive the discrete spectrum of

the GMP, and show that the corresponding wave functions can be connected with the

eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator on the hyperboloid, or, equivalently, with those of

the Schr¨odinger equation for the P¨oschl-Teller potential (PTP),

We will therefore conclude that the exact solvability of the Schr¨odinger equation for the

GMP is explained by its connection with the so(2, 2) algebra.

Let us analyze the symmetry problem for the GMP in detail. We start by considering

the four-dimensional Minkowski space determined by the relations [11, 14]

x2 = ρ cosh θ sin ϕ

We notice that according to the choice of coordinates (3.3), the problem of determining

the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami-Casimir operator corresponds

to the reduction

of the so(2, 2) algebra into its subalgebras so1(2) and so2(2), generated by the operators

characterizes the irrep of the algebra so(2, 2), belonging to the discrete series of its most

degenerate unitary irreps [14].

It is well known from the general theory of so(p, q) irreps [14], that in a given irrep

DL of so(2, 2), the admissible values of the quantum numbers m1 and m2 are given by the

condition

then there are no bound states.

Let us now establish the connection of the GMP problem with the so(2, 2) Laplace

equation and the Schr¨odinger equation (3.16). It is easy to check that the change of variable

and of function (2.4), (2.5), followed by the transformation

y = sinh2 θ

Φ(y) = y−1/4(1 + y)−1/4Ξ(y)

Ξ(y) = χ(θ)

(3.19)

maps the Schr¨odinger equation for the GMP into that corresponding to the PTP, given in

eq. (3.16). Therefore, we can use the results obtained for the latter to ﬁnd the level spectrum

and corresponding eigenfunctions of the GMP. For such purpose, we should identify

Hence, we directly obtain eq. (2.11)1, and from it the GMP spectrum (2.15).

Thus, we have shown that the GMP eigenvalue spectrum can be obtained by using

the Laplace-Beltrami-Casimir operator for the so(2, 2) algebra. The eigenfunctions of the

Laplace operator (or, equivalently, of the PTP Hamiltonian) are related to those of the GMP

through eq. (3.19). We have therefore established that so(2, 2) is the algebra responsible for

the GMP exact solvability. In the next section, we shall proceed to construct its generators,

and to study their action on the GMP wave functions.

4 Symmetry algebra associated with the generalized

Morse potential

According to the analysis of the previous section, by interchanging the roles of energy and

potential parameters, our original Schr¨odinger equation for the GMP can be mapped into

the Schr¨odinger equation for the PTP (3.16), provided we make the identiﬁcations (3.20).

In terms of the variable y deﬁned in (3.19), the (unnormalized) solutions of the

PTP Schr¨odinger equation can be written as

and make this substitution in eq. (4.1). Taking eq. (2.11) into account, we obtain

In deriving eqs. (4.12) and (4.13), we used the fact that the action of G±, G3, M ±, M3 on

the extended, unnormalized GMP wave functions is the same as that of G
on Ξ(l)

The irreducible representations of both su(1, 1) algebras are therefore characterized by l or,

equivalently, by C =

kb2, or by the combination Db2/a2 of the parameters regulating the

−

depth, the position of the minimum, and the radius of the GMP, respectively (see eqs. (2.9)

and (2.10)).

As we can see from eq. (4.12), the operators G± change g into g

1, respectively, without

±

changing m. According to the deﬁnitions (4.2) of g and m, and eqs. (2.11), (2.12),

n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

They are non-unitary, as already noted for those associated with g.

So as advertised in section 1, we have shown that the GMP so(2, 2) symmetry algebra

does not leave invariant the energy eigenvalue of a set of satellite potentials, but instead

the parameter combination (1.6), where the function f is given by f = Db2/a2, and for

the index m we may use either g or m, as deﬁned in eq. (4.2). As a ﬁnal point, it is worth

stressing that for the so(2, 2) algebra (but not for the corresponding group SO(2, 2)), the

quantum number l, characterizing its irreducible representations, is not restricted to integer

or half-integer values. Hence our algebraic formalism may be used for any real values of

the GMP parameters D, b, and a, for which bound states do exist.

5 Concluding remarks

In the present paper, we did study in detail the bound state spectrum of the GMP, pre-

viously proposed by Deng and Fan [8] as a potential function for diatomic molecules. By

connecting the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation with the Laplace equation on the hyper-

boloid and the Schr¨odinger equation for the PTP, we did explain the exact solvability of the

15

problem by an so(2, 2) symmetry algebra, giving rise to a set of satellite potentials of a new

type. Such a symmetry algebra diﬀers from the well-known potential algebras [2, 3, 4, 5]

by the fact that its Casimir operators are not related to the Hamiltonian as for the latter,

but to some function of the potential parameters.

It is worth noticing that some algebras with generators simultaneously changing the

energy and the potential parameters, as the GMP so(2, 2) symmetry algebra, did already

occur in another context. Some years ago, various attempts have indeed been made to com-

bine features of both dynamical and potential algebras by enlarging the latter with some

operators connecting eigenfunctions corresponding to the same potential parameters, but

diﬀerent energy eigenvalues [2, 5, 15]. The resulting algebras, referred to as dynamical po-

tential algebras [15], may contain as substructures some algebras with the above-mentioned

characteristics. However these subalgebras strikingly diﬀer from the GMP symmetry alge-

bra, in the sense that their Casimir operators are some complicated functions of both the

Hamiltonian and the potential parameters, instead of the latter only.

The new type of satellite potentials introduced in the present paper may be physically
relevant in the following context. The vibrational potentials V (r) and V ′(r), corresponding
to diﬀerent electronic states Ke and K ′

e of a diatomic molecule, are in general diﬀerent.

In an analysis of electromagnetic transitions between rovibrational bands, based on the
electronic states Ke and K ′
e respectively, the corresponding eigenfunctions Ψ(r) and Ψ′(r)
in the potentials V (r) and V ′(r) should be used to calculate the Frank-Condon factors.

The above-mentioned approach allows one to connect with one another the potentials V (r)
and V ′(r), which might be taken as GMP’s, by identifying them as members of the set of

satellite potentials. The algebraic relation between the corresponding eigenfunctions Ψ(r)
and Ψ′(r), which were established here, would then signiﬁcantly simplify the calculation of

Frank-Condon factors. In such respect, the su(1, 1) subalgebra of so(2, 2) associated with g
looks more promising than that associated with m, since the operators G±, whose action

is illustrated in ﬁg. 2, could describe transitions where the vibrational molecular states

(characterized by n), and the electronic states (belonging to deﬁnite satellite potentials)

change simultaneously. We plan to analyse this point further in a forthcoming publication.

Appendix. SUSYQM analysis and normalization of
wave functions

The purpose of the present appendix is to brieﬂy review the SUSYQM approach to the GMP

problem, and to use it to prove eq. (2.19) for the wave function normalization coeﬃcient.

Let us consider the Schr¨odinger equation (2.2) for the GMP in dimensionless variable x,

and denote the corresponding Hamiltonian, potential, energies, and wave functions by h0),

n , and ψ(0)

n (x), respectively. In SUSYQM [6, 7], the hamiltonian h(0) can be written

v(0), ǫ(0)
in a factorized form, h(0) = A+A− + ǫ(0)
where the superpotential W (x) is related to the ground state wave function ψ(0)

0 , in terms of the operators A± =

d/dx + W (x),

The supersymmetric partner of h(0) is the Hamiltonian h(1) = A−A+ + ǫ(0)

h(0), h(1), and A±, we can form the generators of an su(1/1) superalgebra, namely the

lead to the conclusion that

α′
n = αn+1

n = βn+1.

We have therefore derived two equivalent expressions (A.12), and (A.19) for the wave

functions of the GMP supersymmetric partner. By equating them, we obtain the following

recursion relation for the normalization coeﬃcients

The recursion starting value is the ground state normalization coeﬃcient, which can be

expressed in terms of beta or gamma functions, as follows:

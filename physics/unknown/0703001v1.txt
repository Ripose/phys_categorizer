Textbooks introduce the Debye temperature to simplify the integration of the heat capacity.  

This approach gives the impression that the Debye temperature is a parameter which makes the 

integration more convenient.  The Debye temperature separates the independent and the 

interacting thermal lattice vibration which should be clearly explained to students.  An example 

of such explanation, deriving the Debye temperature from basic quantum and thermodynamic 

assumptions, is presented.  The equations derived from theory are tested by experiments of face-

centered cubic structures.  Correlation between the minimum acoustic wavelength and the mean 

acoustic velocity is detected. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

In solid phase, by assuming small displacement from the equilibrium position, atoms execute 

simple vibrational motion in the x, y, and z direction which is called lattice vibration.   Assuming 

linear elasticity the internal energy of a system [U] can be calculated as:

This theoretical value of the molar volume heat capacity is known as the DuLong-Petit law2.  

At room temperatures Eq. (4) is in excellent agreement with experiments; however, at low 

temperatures significant deviation is observed.   Einstein proposed that the independent harmonic 
vibration of the atoms around their equilibrium position must be quantized3 in accordance with 
Planck’s suggestion4,5.  According to quantum mechanics the possible energy levels of a 
harmonic oscillator are

Both the Dulong-Petit and Einstein models assume independent atomic vibration.  Born and 
Von Karman6 proposed that the bonding in solid phase prevents independent atomic vibration 
and that the vibration should be collective lattice oscillation.  If the particles are interacting then 

the potential energy of the particle in the crystal depends on the distance from its neighbor and 

Eq.(1) must be modified as:

Equation (15) has to be evaluated numerically8.  The approximation of the Debye model is valid 
for all monoatomic solids. 

The introduction of the Debye model is part of the standard curriculum in any solid state 
physics course9, 10 and has been covered from different aspects in this journal11-16.  Textbooks 
define the Debye temperature in the form of Eq. (14) as part of the integration of the heat 
capacity1,9, 10, 17.  This approach gives the impression that the Debye temperature is a parameter 
which makes the integration easier.  The Debye temperature has very important physical 

meaning which should be clearly explained to students.  An example of such explanation is 

presented.

particle in a box. 

In solid phase the lattice vibrations are quantized and can be described by quasi-particles, 

phonons.  It is assumed that the phonons represent a normal mode vibration thus all parts of the 

lattice vibrate with the same frequency.  This quantum mechanical approach can be modeled as a 

Assuming that the particle is in a cubic box and that the length of the box is L then the 

wavelength [

The size of the vibrating units sets a limit on the minimum wavelength since shorter 

wavelengths do not lead to new modes of the vibration.  This minimum wavelength sets a 
maximum frequency [

and a highest mode number [

 that an acoustic vibration can

reach.  The maximum frequency limits the vibrational energy, and the highest energy of acoustic 

vibrations is

Beyond this energy interacting or organized lattice vibration does not exist and the 

thermodynamic behavior of the system is described by independent lattice vibration.  The 
internal energy of a system with independent thermal lattice vibration [

is given by Eq.

Using the equality of the thermal internal energies Eq. (25) the Debye temperature can be 

the Debye temperature, which can be defined as:

. 

This expression is identical with the conventional definition given in Eq. (14).  Most text 

books use the symbol 

Dθ  for the Debye temperature since the definition is introduced in relation 

to vibrational frequencies.  I think the symbol 

DT  is more appropriate since it expresses clearly 

the temperature nature of the Debye temperature; therefore, this symbol will be used in the 

remaining part of this paper. 

III. TESTING THE THEORY BY EXPERIMENTS 

The simplest vibrating systems are monoatomic where the vibrating units are atoms.  The size 

of these vibrating units can be represented by the atomic diameter [d].  Theoretically the acoustic 

lattice vibration (or interacting vibration) should start to vanish when half of the wavelength of 

the acoustic vibration reaches the atomic diameter, and should completely vanish when the 

wavelength of the acoustic vibration is equivalent to the atomic diameter 

The minimum wavelength of the acoustic waves can be described as: 

where a is a numerical factor with a predicted value of

Using the available acoustic velocity and Debye temperature data of elements with fcc 
structure18  (Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Pb, Pt) the numerical factor [a] from Eq. (33) was calculated.  
Analyzing the data by plotting the calculated values of the numerical factor against the mean 

acoustic velocity reveals a linear correlation between these variables (Fig. 1).  The correlation 

coefficient is 0.9977.  The correlation can be described as:

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

In solid phase there are two kinds of lattice thermal vibrations, interacting and non-

interacting.  The temperature, which separates these different lattice thermal vibrations, is the 

Debye temperature.  The general formula for the Debye temperature is derived from fundamental 

quantum and thermodynamic assumptions.  Presenting this derivation to students helps to 

explain the physics behind this important thermodynamic parameter. 

The derived expression of the Debye temperature was tested by experiments of monoatomic 

systems with fcc structure.  The minimum wavelength of the acoustic vibration was assumed to 

be between d and 2d.  The exact value of the numerical factor was calculated from the 

experiments.  It has been found that the numerical factor correlates with the mean sound 

velocity.  Using the detected correlation allows to reproduce the experimental values within 1%.

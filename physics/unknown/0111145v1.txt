In the past thirty years the Near-Earth Neutral Line model for substorms has been proven to be correct in its ba-
sic assumption, i.e., that a new neutral line is created near the Earth during substorm onset. Yet there have also 
been numerous changes and additions to this model, which were necessary to give a more complete and deeper 
understanding of the substorm process. This process is still continuing. 

Abstract 

1. Introduction 

More than three decades ago, the first phenomenological description of substorm in terms of auroral activity was 
introduced (Akasofu, 1964). The auroral substorm concept was extended soon after to encompass disturbances 
throughout the entire magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The energy for substorms was attributed to a physical 
process  known  as  magnetic  reconnection,  envisioned  to  convert  energy  between  magnetic  field  and  charged 
particles by cutting magnetic field lines and rejoining them with different ones.  

Thirty years ago, McPherron et al. (1970) and Hones et al. (1970) have put together the first aspects of a phe-
nomenological  substorm  model,  which  had  as  key  ingredient  the  development  of  a  new  magnetic  neutral  line 
closer to the Earth (than the distant neutral line at about 80-100 RE) during substorm onset, and was subsequently 
called Near-Earth Neutral Line model, or short NENL model. This model has now been around for more than 25 
years. During these years, it has been evolved considerably. While it has been thought earlier that the new neu-
tral line is located rather close to the Earth, results from the recent Geotail mission have now established that it is 
typically located between 20 and 25 RE, since it is this distance range where the high-speed plasma flow typi-
cally changes from Earthward to tailward during substorm onset (see Fig. 1 and, e.g., Nagai et al., 1998; Baum-
johann et al., 1999).  

Actually  most  substorm  researchers,  even  those  with  competing  models  like  Rostoker  (1996)  or  Lui  and 
Murphree (1998), do agree that such a neutral line appears during a substorm. Near-Earth reconnection is essen-
tial for shortening the magnetic flux tube, i.e., the bundle of field lines filled with collisionless plasma and thus 
tied closely together, before it can proceed to complete its Earthward convection cycle from the high-β magneto-
tail into the inner dipolar magnetosphere. 

In the present short review on the present state of the NENL model, I will not much go into the history of its 
development over the past 25-30 years, but rather focus on new elements and additional insight gained during 
the past ten years. Actually, the last 2-3 years were the most interesting ones for the development of this model, 
with  many  important  new  facets  of  this  model  being  explored,  due  to,  on  the  one  hand,  much  improved  data, 
mainly from the Japanese Geotail mission (Nishida, 1994), and, on the other side, more sophisticated numerical 
simulations of the processes in the Earth's magnetotail (e.g., Birn et al., 1999). 

As most reviews, also this one will be biased to the author's own views and work and I would like to apologize 
to  all  those  colleagues,  may  they  be  NENL  model  proponents  or  opponents,  whose  contributions  are  not  ac-
knowledged here to the extent they should. For other substorm models, I refer the reader to Rostoker (1996) or 
Lui  and  Murphree  (1998)  and  references  therein.  A  slightly  different  view  on  the  present  state  of  the  NENL 
model can be found in, for example, Baker et al. (1996, 1999).

2. Substorms as a natural way to avoid the pressure crisis 

During a magnetic substorm, enhanced solar wind energy input and dayside magnetopause reconnection lead to 
magnetic field lines being transported over the poles into the tail lobes. This is the growth phase, which can eas-
ily be observed during isolated substorms. These field lines, or part of thereof, are subsequently reconnected at 
the distant neutral line. From here, the field lines and the plasma tied to them start traveling Earthward with high 
velocities. 

Since the magnetotail tailward of, say, 30 RE is a high-β region, where the plasma energy clearly dominates over 
the magnetic energy, this flow proceeds rather uninhibited (see Fig. 2). However, when it reaches about 25 RE, 
plasma-β starts to drop and the influence of the Earth’s dipolar field increases. For the flow to proceed adiabati-
cally further inward, the plasma pressure inside a flux tube would have to increase dramatically, since the flux 
tube volume strongly decreases close to the Earth.  

In fact, the flux tube would be repelled from the inner magnetosphere by its own over pressure. In order to avoid 
this pressure catastrophe, near-Earth reconnection sets in, cuts the field lines and thus severely reduces the flux 
tube volume, and thus its mass and particle content, further (see Fig. 3 and, e.g., Hesse et al., 2001). This is the 
start  of  the  expansion  phase.  The  outer  part  of  the  flux  tube  moves  outward  again  as  a  bundle  of  closed  field 
lines, the plasmoid, while the inner part proceeds in its convection cycle. 

3. Transient nature of the flux transport  

While  it  has  earlier  been  thought  that  this  NENL is  always a large-scale phenomenon, the intermittent, bursty 
nature of the high-speed flow between 10 and 20 RE strongly suggests that near-Earth reconnection also occurs 
in an intermittent and bursty fashion and that it may often be a localized phenomenon. 

In fact, Baumjohann et al. (1990) showed that in the neighborhood of the neutral sheet inside of 20 RE high-
speed flows are rather bursty with the majority staying uninteruptedly at high speed levels for no more than 10 
sec.  Angelopoulos  et  al  (1992)  noted  that  the  high-speed  flows  did  not  occur  at  random,  but  rather  organize 
themselves in 10-min time scale flow enhancements which they called bursty bulk flow events. Fig. 4 shows a 
superposed epoch analysis of the behavior of the flows speed and the magnetic field elevation around the center 
of more than 100 bursty bulk flow events. The typical bursty flow event lasts about 10 min and is often associ-
ated with a dipolarization of the ambient magnetic field, a feature which will become important in Section 5.  

Despite  the  fact  that  the  bursty  flows  typically  cover  only  10-20%  of  all  measurements,  they  are  the  primary 
means of Earthward transport of mass, momentum, and magnetic flux (e.g., Angelopoulos et al., 1999; Schödel 
et al., 2000). The relative numbers vary somewhat with radial distance, but in the midnight sector around 20 RE, 
where the bursty transport maximizes, it often accounts for more than 80% of the Earthward transport of mass, 
momentum, and magnetic flux. 

While bursty flow events are always seen during substorm onset and the expansion phase (if a satellite is in the 
right location to observe them), it has always been argued that many of them occur without classical substorm 
signatures. However, those signatures may have simply been overlooked. Taking into account that even pseudo-
breakups  and  very  small  substorms  show  all  the  signatures  of  near-Earth  reconnection  (see,  e.g.,  Aikio  et  al., 
1999; Petrukovich et al., 1998, 2000) and should thus be classified as substorms, and that there is a one-to-one 
correlation  between  auroral  brightening  and  fast  flows  (Nakamura  et  al.,  2000),  it  seems  likely  that  there  is  a 
one-to-one correlation between bursty flow events and substorm activity. 

4. Substorms with closed flux reconnection only 

While in the original classical version of the NENL model the energy dissipated during the substorm expansion 
phase was thought to come directly from the magnetic energy stored in the tail lobes via reconnection of these 
open field lines, during recent years it has it has been noticed that near-Earth reconnection is often restricted to 
the plasma sheet, i.e. closed field lines, and only in major substorms lobe field lines are reconnected at the near-
Earth neutral line (e.g., Baumjohann et al., 1996; Fox et al., 1999). Hence, reconnection of open flux stored in 

- 2 - 

the tail lobes can not be considered anymore as a necessary element of a substorm, at least not for all of those 
that occur during disturbed intervals where often one substorm follows the other.  

Of course, the energy dissipated during a substorm still mainly comes from magnetic energy stored as open flux 
in the tail lobes during the growth phase. But during a lot of substorms, and perhaps even during the first phase 
of those with clear open flux reconnection signatures, magnetic-to-plasma energy conversion will take place at 
the  distant  neutral  line,  while  near-Earth  reconnection  will  mainly  be  driven  by  the  enhanced  transport  in  the 
distant tail and the need to complete the convection cycle yet to avoid the impeding pressure crisis (Hesse et al., 
2001). 

If substorms come in a sequence, as they often do, the initial pseudo-breakups (see, e.g., Nakamura et al., 1994; 
Aikio et al., 1999) and the initial full substorm onsets show signatures of reconnection, but do not seem to be 
associated  with  open  flux  reconnection  (e.g.,  Fox  et  al.,  1999;  Mishin  et  al.,  2000).  Open  flux  reconnection 
rather seems to occur for the last substorm in that sequence, which starts when the interplanetary magnetic field 
finally turns northward (Caan et al., 1975; Mishin et al., 2000). 

5. Flow braking and ionospheric substorm signatures 

The fast bursty flows generated by near-Earth reconnection soon encounter another obstacle: the strongly dipolar 
field of the inner magnetosphere, where plasma-β drops below unity (see Fig. 2). The outward pressure gradient 
strongly decelerates and brakes this flow (Shiokawa et al., 1997), with possibly some of it diverted duskward. As 
sketched in Fig. 5, the braking itself, and even more the plasma pressure gradients built up by the plasma trans-
ported inward with the bursty flows, leads to the generation of a dawnward cross-tail current, diversion of the 
originally duskward neutral sheet current through the auroral ionosphere, dipolarization of the field (noticeable 
in Fig. 4), and thus the establishment of the substorm current wedge (Birn et al., 1999). The buildup of the sub-
storm  current  wedge  will  be  associated  with  Pi2  pulsations  and  auroral  kilometric  radiation  (Shiokawa  et  al., 
1998; Fairfield et al., 1999).  

Furthermore, there are ideas that the stress put onto the field lines during the braking and/or diversion will lead 
to parallel electric fields and thus brightening of aurora (Haerendel, 1992). Brightening of aurora associated with 
braking of bursty fast flows has actually been observed recently (Fairfield et al., 1999, Nakamura et al., 2000). 
Hence,  the  flow  braking  may  cause  all  the  typical  signatures  of  substorm  onset  in  the  ionosphere,  at  latitudes 
corresponding to L-values around 10. 

The  bursty  bulk  flow  and  its  braking  is  one  of  the  key  ingredients  of  the  present-day  near-Earth  neutral  line 
model  (depicted  in  Fig.  5)  and  distinguishes  it  from  the  classical  one  which  had  the  auroral  breakup and sub-
storm current wedge tied to a near-Earth X-line. It also resolves a long-standing puzzle (and objection against the 
original  classical  version),  namely  that  the  field  lines  where  near-Earth  reconnection  occurs  should  have  their 
footprint  near  the  breakup  aurora.  This  was  difficult  to  reconcile,  since  the  field  lines  threading  the  breakup 
aurora typically map to the equatorial region near 10 RE rather than to 20-25 RE. Now we can say that near-Earth 
reconnection takes place further out and that the brightening of aurora is related to the fast bursty flows and oc-
curs somewhere along their pass, most likely where the fast flows generated by near-Earth reconnection are ef-
fectively stopped and perhaps partially diverted. However, it remains unclear how this location is connected to 
the most equatorward auroral arc, where the auroral breakup typically occurs. 

6. Substorm Recovery and quenching of near-Earth reconnection 

During the course of the substorm, the fast bursty flows will transport more and more magnetic flux inward. This 
flux is being piled-up and the associated dipolarization front moves tailward. As shown in Fig. 6, between 30-45 
min  after  onset  the  tailward  expanding  dipolarization  front  reaches  the  location  of  the  near-Earth  neutral  line 
near 20-25 RE. Since reconnection cannot proceed in a dipolar magnetic field configuration, the near-Earth neu-
tral line moves rapidly tailward, still producing fast Earthward flow. This is the beginning of the recovery phase 
(Baumjohann et al., 1999). 

Hence, near-Earth reconnection effectively strangles itself after some time. It is quenched by the successive pile-
up of those closed dipolar field lines it generates. This is the simple solution of the long-standing puzzle why 

 

 

 

- 3 - 

often  the  unloading  of  stored  magnetic  energy  stops  before  the  energy  reservoir  available  in  the  magnetic  tail 
lobes  is  fully  depleted.  It  may  also  answer  the  question  posed  in  Section  5,  i.e.,  why  near-Earth  reconnection 
during many substorms just reconnects closed plasma sheet field lines and does not always proceed to reconnect 
open  lobe  field  lines  at  the  near-Earth  neutral  line:  at  least  in  these  cases  the  dipolar  flux  pile-up  reaches  the 
near-Earth neutral line earlier than reconnection at the latter reaches the lobe. 

7. Conclusion and outlook 

While the present-day version of the Near-Earth Neutral Line model is the most comprehensive description of 
the processes occurring during a substorm, i.e., fits most aspects of the observed data and agrees with numerical 
simulations of magnetotail processes, there are still a couple of open questions.  

One key question is what determines the onset of near-Earth reconnection, especially why does it occur at 20-25 
RE and why is it so time-dependent and/or localized (as indicated by the bursty nature of the fast flows). Is it 
really because plasma-β starts to drop here as indicated in Fig. 2 and discussed above? Do local conditions play 
an important role? 

Another one is why substorms come in so vastly different sizes, yet even very small ones show the basic signa-
tures  of  near-Earth  reconnection  and  plasmoid  release  (see,  e.g.,  Aikio  et  al.,  1999;  Petrukovich  et  al.,  2000). 
Why is reconnection sometimes quenched before it reaches open lobe field lines? Does it always choke itself as 
speculated  in  the  previous  section?  How  can  plasmoids  be  released  under  such  conditions,  when  closed  field 
lines may still exist tailward of the plasmoid?  

Another important still somewhat open issue pertains to the connection between the magnetotail outside of, say, 
10 RE and the inner magnetosphere and ionosphere. While the flow braking scenario was a first breakthrough in 
answering this question, it still leaves a couple of open issues. Among them are (1) a possible active role of the 
ionosphere in something like a feedback mechanism by, for example, the generation of a Cowling channel in the 
active  aurora  region  (Baumjohann  et  al.,  1981)  and  (2)  a  more  violent  reaction  of  the  inner  magnetosphere 
around 6-8 RE to the flow braking than presently envisioned in the NENL model (see, for example, Ohtani et al., 
1999; Lui et al., 2000). 

While some of these questions may be answered in the near future by more advanced numerical modeling (using 
global hybrid or even kinetic codes with enough spatial resolution instead of the present-day MHD simulations) 
or more ingenious analysis of presently available data, some may have to wait for new data to arrive from multi-
point satellite missions. Unfortunately, the orbit of the first of the four spacecraft missions, ESA's Cluster II, is 
not  well  suited  for  magnetotail  physics,  but  NASA's  planned  MMS  mission  will  certainly  be  of  great  help  in 
studying the microphysics of near-Earth reconnection. However, the more mesoscale aspects of substorm phys-
ics, e.g. the turbulent aspects of the bursty fast flows, will have to await truly multipoint missions, like the Draco 
mission presently under study.

FOR WAKEFIELD CALCULATIONS

Abstract

The operation of a Free Electron Laser (FEL) in the ultra-
violet or in the X-ray regime requires the acceleration of
electron bunches with an rms length of 25 to 50 µm. The
wakeﬁelds generated by these sub picosecond bunches ex-
tend into the frequency range well beyond the threshold for
Cooper pair breakup (about 750 GHz) in superconducting
niobium at 2 K. It is shown, that the superconducting cavi-
ties can indeed be operated with 25 µm bunches without
suffering  a  breakdown  of  superconductivity  (quench),
however at the price of a reduced quality factor and an in-
creased heat transfer to the superﬂuid helium bath.

This was ﬁrst shown by wakeﬁeld calculations based on
the diffraction model [1]. In the meantime a more conven-
tional method of computing wake ﬁelds in the time domain
by  numerical  methods  was  developed  and  used  for  the
wakeﬁeld calculations [2]. Both methods lead to compara-
ble results: the operation of TESLA with 25 µm bunches is
possible  but  leads  to  an  additional  heat  load  due  to  the
higher order modes (HOMs). Therefore HOM dampers for
these  high  frequencies  are  under  construction  [3].  These
dampers are located in the beam pipes between the 9-cell
cavities. So it is of interest, if there are trapped modes in
the cavity due to closed photon orbits.

In  this  paper  we  investigate  the  existence  of  trapped
modes and the distribution of heat load over the surface of
the TESLA cavity by numerical photon tracking.

1    INTRODUCTION

The use of a numerical photon tracking is justiﬁed by the
fact, that we are only interested in photons above 750 GHz,
which  means  a  wavelength  lower  than  0.4 mm.  From
former investigations two important questions remain:

• Are  there  photons,  which  remain  trapped  within  the

model for eigenvalues of quantum systems. This is a suit-
able model for high frequency photons in a superconduct-
ing resonator, because of the very low surface resistance:
In the frequency range below 750 GHz, which covers over
96% of the HOM energy of a 25 µm bunch, the surface re-
sistance of niobium at 2 K is of some µ
 [2]. The charac-
teristic number of hits 
 depends on the impedance step at
the surface:

The ﬁrst point is of importance for the applicability of pho-
ton absorbers located in the beam pipes. The second point
concerns the risk of quenching of cavities caused by con-
centrated photon absorption.

2    PHOTON TRACKING

For the calculations we used a numerical model of a mass
point bouncing elastically through a two dimensional cut
of the TESLA cavity like a classical billiard. The chaotic
motion in these billiards is well investigated and used as

Figure 2: Deﬁnition of one half TESLA cavity with half beam pipe and symmetry planes (left and mid)
As can be seen in Fig. 1 the shape of the TESLA cavity is
deﬁned by a sequence of straight, round and elliptic graph-
ical  elements.  The  geometric  data  are  given  in  table 1.
Fig. 2 shows the geometry of one half 9-cell cavity consist-
ing of 42 graphical elements. With a computer program the
intersection of the photon track and each wall element is
calculated and sorted with respect to the distance. Each in-
tersection  between  photon  trace  and  cavity  contour  is
treated as a reﬂection process.

3    TRAPPED MODES

Following the concepts as described in [4], [5], [6] and [7]
we  assumed  an  entirely  chaotic  behavior  for  the  elliptic
shaped TESLA cavity. This was proven by numerical ex-
periments with different starting conditions. For example,
Fig. 3 shows two photon tracks (black and gray) started in
the upper left corner of the cavity, both in parallel to the
beam axis with slightly different offset. After a few reﬂec-
tions  the  tracks  become  completely  different  from  each
other.  There  is  no  need  to  distinguish  between  different
classes  of  tracks,  since  photon  tracks  change  between
„whispering gallery orbits“, „bouncing ball orbits“ and or-
bits in parallel to the beam axis travelling from cavity to
cavity through the beam pipe within some reﬂections.

Figure 3: Two tracks with slightly different initial cond.

The next investigation is devoted to the problem of photons
trapped in one cavity. Therefore in the shadow region of
each cavity a photon source was established (see Fig. 4).
This  is  the  numerical  analogon  to  the  experiment  with  a
light bulb in a cavity model made of copper [1].

The number of reﬂections until the escape through the
beam pipe takes place is well below 100. Even from the
middle cell (#5) photons leave the cavity within 64 reﬂec-
tions in the average (see Fig. 5). Towards the end cells this
number is reduced to 23. Thus it is clearly shown, that there
exists no location in the cavity, where photons are trapped.

4    HEAT DISTRIBUTION

To study the process of heating a photon was injected into
the  half  cavity.  During  the  ﬂight  the  photon  experiences
multiple reﬂections with the cavity wall. Fig. 6 shows the
track of the photon after 1,000 reﬂections.

Figure 6: One photon track consisting of 1,000 reﬂections

As can be seen in Fig. 7 the large number of reﬂections and
their chaotic structure have the beneﬁcial effect, that the ra-
diation power, which eventually has to be absorbed by the
niobium, is distributed over the whole cavity surface. The
oscillating characteristic in Fig. 7 is caused by the different
shape of the reﬂecting objects: There are straight objects
and objects with curvature alternating with each other, as

 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 

 

can be seen in Fig. 1. And in the average the surface seen
by the photon is smaller for bent objects. Despite this be-
havior the number of hits are equally distributed over the
whole surface: There are about eight reﬂections per mm for
a total number of 20,000 reﬂections.

Due to the fact, that most of the diffracted radiation hits the
ﬁrst iris of the 9-cell cavity in a narrow ring shaped region
close to the smallest diameter of the iris, a point like photon
source at the iris edge was investigated. The initial condi-
tion with an emitting angle of 

/100 is shown in Fig. 8:

The results in Fig. 9 show clearly, that the starting condi-
tion  for  multiple  reﬂections  is  not  of  importance  for  the
over all distribution. Only the symmetry planes #1 and #22
are hit slightly more often by the photons. This is caused by
the fact, that both surfaces are hit in the very beginning of

ﬁve or ten reﬂections the motion is dominated by chaotic
behavior.

5    CONCLUSION

The  results  of  the  numerical  calculations  have  clearly
shown, that the results delivered by a former light bulb ex-
periment are in quite good agreement but a bit too pessi-
mistic  caused  by  the  limited  reﬂectivity  of  the  copper
model. Thus no problems caused by trapped photons are
expected during FEL operation of the TESLA collider. The
number  of  reﬂections  needed  to  escape  from  a  cavity  is
quite small compared to the number of reﬂections needed
to absorb the photon in the wall. So the efﬁciency of high
frequency photon absorbers for the THz region in the beam
pipes can be taken for granted.

Furthermore it was shown, that the photon absorption is
not concentrated on certain regions, e.g. the iris edges; the
heat load is distributed over the whole cavity surface with
a ﬂuctuation of 25% only.

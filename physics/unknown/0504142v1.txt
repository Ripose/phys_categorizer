We have developed two radiation-hard ASICs for optical data transmission in the ATLAS pixel detector 
at  the  LHC  at  CERN:  a  driver  chip  for  a  Vertical  Cavity  Surface  Emitting  Laser  (VCSEL)  diode  for  80 
Mbit/s data transmission from the detector, and a Bi-Phase Mark decoder chip to recover the control data 
and 40 MHz clock received optically by a PIN diode.  We have successfully implemented both ASICs in 
0.25  m m  CMOS  technology  using  enclosed  layout  transistors  and  guard  rings  for  increased  radiation 
hardness.  We present results of the performance of these chips, including irradiation with 24 GeV protons 
up to 61 Mrad (2.3 x 1015 p/cm2).

I.  INTRODUCTION 

The  ATLAS  pixel  detector  [1]  consists  of  two  barrel  layers,  two  forward,  and  two  backward  disks 
which  provide  at  least  two  space  point  measurements.    The  pixel  sensors  are  read  out  by  front-end 
electronics  controlled  by  the  Module  Control  Chip  (MCC).    The  low  voltage  differential  signal  (LVDS) 
from  the  MCC  is  converted  by  the  VCSEL  Driver  Chip  (VDC)  into  a  single-ended signal appropriate to 
drive  a  Vertical  Cavity  Surface  Emitting  Laser  (VCSEL).    The  optical  signal  from  the  VCSEL  is 
transmitted to the Readout Device (ROD) via a fiber. 

The  40  MHz  beam-crossing  clock  from  the  ROD,  bi-phase  mark  (BPM)  encoded  with  the  command 
signal to control the pixel detector, is transmitted via a fiber to a PIN diode.  This BPM encoded signal is 
decoded using a Digital Opto-Receiver Integrated Circuit (DORIC).  The clock and data signals recovered 
by the DORIC are in LVDS form for interfacing with the MCC. 

The ATLAS pixel optical link system contains 448 VDCs and 360 DORICs with each chip containing 
four channels. The chips couple to 224 VCSEL and 180 PIN array optical packages (opto-packs). The chips 
and opto-packs are mounted on 180 chip carrier boards (opto-boards). 

The  silicon  components  (DORIC/VDC  and  PIN)  of  the  pixel  optical  link  system  are  expected  to  be 
exposed  to  a  maximum  total  fluence  of  3.7  x  1014  1-MeV  neq/cm2  during  ten  years  of  operation  at  the 
LHC.  The corresponding dosage for the GaAs component (VCSEL) is 2 x 1015 1-MeV neq/cm2. We study 
the response of the optical link to a high dose of 24 GeV protons. The expected equivalent dosages at LHC 
are 6.3 and 3.8 x 1014 p/cm2, respectively. For simplicity, we present the results from the irradiations with 
dosage expressed in Mrad using the conversion factor, 1 Mrad = 3.75 x 1013 p/cm2. 

In this paper we describe the development and testing of the radiation-hard VDC and DORIC circuits 

for use in the ATLAS pixel detector’s optical link. 

II.  VDC CIRCUIT 

The  VDC  is  used  to  convert  an  LVDS  input  signal  into  a  single-ended  signal  appropriate  to  drive  a 
VCSEL in a common cathode array.  The output current of the VDC should be variable between 0 and 20 
mA through an external control current, with a standing (dim) current of ~1 mA to improve the switching 
speed of the VCSEL. The electrical output should have rise and fall times (20–80%) between 0.5 and 2.0 
ns; nominally 1.0 ns. In order to minimize the power supply noise on the opto-board, the VDC should also 
have constant current consumption independent of whether the VCSEL output is in the bright (on) or dim 
(off) state. 

Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the VDC circuit. An LVDS receiver converts the differential input 
into  a  single-ended  signal.    The  driver  controls  the  current  flow  from  the  positive  power  supply  into  the 
anode of the VCSEL. The VDC circuit is therefore compatible with a common cathode VCSEL array.  An 
externally controlled voltage (VIset) determines the current Iset that sets the amplitude of the VCSEL current 
(bright  minus  dim  current),  while  another  externally  controlled  voltage  (Tunepad)  determines  the  dim 
current.    The  driver  contains  a  dummy  driver  circuit  which,  in  the  VCSEL  dim  state,  draws  an  identical 
amount  of  current  from  the  positive  power  supply  as  is  flowing  through  the  VCSEL  in  the  bright  state.  
This enables the VDC to have constant current consumption. 

III.  DORIC CIRCUIT 

The function of the DORIC is to decode BPM encoded clock and data signals received by a PIN diode.  
Figure  2  shows  an  example  of  a  BPM  encoded  signal.  The  40  MHz  beam-crossing  clock  is  encoded  by 
sending transitions corresponding to clock leading edges only.  In the absence of data bits (logic level 0), 
the resulting signal is a 20 MHz square wave. Data bits are encoded as extra transitions at beam crossing 
clock trailing edges. The resulting signal for a string of logic level 1 is a 40 MHz square wave. The delay 
between the decoded data and clock is fixed, simplifying the timing in the MCC chip. In addition, the BPM 
signal  has  50%  duty  cycle,  hence  there  is  no  baseline  shift  due  to  a  different  number  of  data  bits  being 
transmitted. The amplitude of the current from the PIN diode is expected to be in the range of 40 to 1000 

 

2 

m A. The 40 MHz clock recovered by the DORIC is required to have a duty cycle of (50 –
 ?4)% with a total 
timing error (jitter) of less than 1 ns. The MCC can accept  the recovered clock and  decoded data LVDS 
over  a  wide  range  of  signal  average  (1.0–1.5  V)  and  amplitude  (0.2–0.5  V).  The  delay  of  the  data  with 
respect to the clock must be less than 3 ns. 

Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the DORIC circuit. In order to keep the PIN bias voltage (up to 15 
V) off the DORIC, we employ a single-ended preamp circuit to amplify the current produced by the PIN 
diode.  Since  single-ended  preamp  circuits  are  sensitive  to  power  supply  noise,  we  utilize  two  identical 
preamp  channels:  a  signal  channel  and  a  noise  cancellation  channel.    The  signal  channel  receives  and 
amplifies  the  input  signal  from  the  anode  of  the  PIN  diode,  plus  any noise  picked  up  by  the  circuit.  The 
noise cancellation channel amplifies noise similar to that picked up by the signal channel. This noise is then 
subtracted from the signal channel in the differential gain stage. To optimise the noise subtraction, the input 
load of the noise cancellation channel is matched to the input load of the signal channel (PIN capacitance) 
via a dummy capacitance.  

By it’s very nature, the input duty cycle of the BPM signal is 50%. It is very important to preserve this 
in the preamp and gain stage. Any distortion results in an odd-even jitter in the recovered clock. The gain 
stage  is  essentially  a  comparator,  converting  the  linear  output  of  the  preamps  to  logic  signals.  It 
incorporates  internal  feedback  to  adjust  its  threshold  so  that  the  50%  duty  cycle  is  maintained  over  the 
entire input signal range, 40 to 1000 m A.  

In Figure 4 we show a block diagram of the DORIC logic circuitry.  A selection of simulated internal 
logic signals is shown in Figure 5. An edgedet circuit produces a short pulse from each input transition of 
the  gain  stage  output.  Some  of  these  pulses  correspond  to  the  leading  edge  of  the  40  MHz  system  clock 
while other pulses correspond to data logic level 1 signals. The clock recovery circuitry must be taught how 
to distinguish between these. This is accomplished after power-up during an initialization period in which 
only logic level 0 is transmitted. The resulting signal for this case is a 20 MHz square wave. The output of 
the edgedet is a 40 MHz train of short pulses, one for each edge of the input signal. These are applied to 
dflip #1, which is connected as a toggle with feedback delayed by delay #1, #2 and #3. The nominal delay 
of each delay stage is 6.25 ns giving a total delay of 18.75 ns, which is less than the 25 ns period of the 40 
MHz  pulse  train.  Thus  dflip  #1  toggles  and  its  output  is  a  20  MHz  square  wave.  The  two  inputs  to  the 
exclusive  “OR”  are  approximately  90  degrees  out  of  phase.  This  results  in  a  recovered  clock  at  the 
exclusive  “OR”  output  with  duty  cycle  correlated  to  the  exact  delay  of  delay  #2  and  delay  #3.  The 
recovered clock is the input to dcontrol, a circuit that converts duty cycle to a DC voltage. This voltage is 
used to control the delay of delay #2 and #3. Together these blocks, exclusive “OR”, delay #2, delay #3 and 
dcontrol  form  a  delay-lock-loop  keeping  the  recovered  duty  cycle  very  close  to  50%.  This  initialisation 
period must last long enough, about 1ms, for the delay locked loop to settle. 

Once the loop is locked, data pulses can be sent. These will be ignored by dflip #1, as can be seen by 
examining delay #3 and edgedet in Figure 5. For data recovery the edgedet pulses are sent through a short 
delay to dflip #2 whose “D” input is the recovered clock. The timing guarantees that sending a logic level 1 
sets dflip #2. Dflip #3 synchronizes the recovered data to the recovered clock and increases it’s width to the 
full recovered clock period creating a standard NRZ data signal.   

A reset line, RstCTRL, allows for slow and controlled recovery of the delay control circuit without the 

need to cycle the DORIC power. 
 

IV.  VDC AND DORIC DESIGN HISTORY 

The pixel detector design of the VDC and DORIC takes advantage of the development work for similar 
circuits [3] used by the outer detector, the SemiConductor Tracker (SCT).  Both SCT chips attain radiation-
tolerance by using bipolar integrated circuits (AMS 0.8  m m BICMOS) and running with large currents in 
the  transistors  at  4  V  nominal  supply  voltage.    These  chips  are  therefore  not  applicable  for  the  higher 
radiation dosage and lower power budget requirements of the pixel detector. 

 

3 

We originally implemented the VDC and DORIC circuits in radiation-hard DMILL 0.8 m m technology 
with  a  nominal  supply  voltage  of  3.2  V.    Using  three  submissions  from  summer  1999  to  May  2001,  we 
developed circuits in this technology which met the electrical specifications.  However, an irradiation study 
of the DMILL circuits in April 2001 with 24 GeV protons at CERN showed severe degradation of circuit 
performance.  We concluded that the DMILL technology did not meet the radiation hardness requirement 
of the ATLAS pixel detector. 

We have therefore  migrated  the  VDC  and  DORIC  designs  to  the  standard  deep  submicron  (0.25  m m) 
CMOS technology, which has a nominal supply voltage of 2.5 V. By employing enclosed layout transistors 
and guard rings [4], this technology has been proven to be very radiation hard. We had five submissions 
between summer of 2001 and summer of 2003 using three metal layers. Results from the submissions can 
be  found  in  [5].  Below  we  summarize  the  results  from  the  production  run.  For  cost  saving  purpose,  the 
chips were produced with the MCCs that required five metal layers. 

V.  RESULTS FROM DEEP SUBMICRON SUBMISSIONS 

We show the results of various electrical and optical measurements from a sample of eight 4-channel 
VDCs and DORICs. The chips were mounted in 44-pin packages for measurements on a test board, hence 
the performance of the chips is somewhat degraded due to parasitic capacitance from the packages. Figure 
6 shows the VCSEL current generated by the VDCs as a function of the external control current Iset. The 
current was measured with a 1-W
 resistor in series with the VCSEL. The dim current is ~1 mA as designed. 
The bright current saturates above the Iset value of ~0.8 mA. The saturation current is determined by the 
effective resistance of the VCSEL and maximum voltage provided by the VDC for a 2.5 V supply voltage. 
The  saturation  current  is  ~13  mA  in  this  setup,  significantly  below  the  target  20  mA  due  to  the  large 
effective resistance of the VCSEL. Our irradiation studies with protons show that this is adequate to anneal 
the VCSEL. Furthermore, we have verified that the saturation current is larger with the VCSELs that are 
used in the production opto-boards. The VDCs have a fairly balanced current consumption. Figures 7 and 8 
show the optical rise and fall times of the VCSEL as driven by the VDCs. The fall time is under 1.0 ns. The 
rise time is typically ~1 ns. A few channels have rise times as large as 1.5 ns. The rise time as measured on 
the  opto-board  is  under  1.0  ns  for  all  channels  over  the  operating  range  of  the  circuit  due  to  the  more 
optimized board layout.  

All the measurements described below for the DORICs were performed at the PIN current of 100 ? A. 
Measurements at 40 and 800 m A yield similar results. The current consumption of the DORIC is ~75 mA 
for  4  channels  at  the  supply  voltage  of  2.5  V.  The  amplitude  and  average  of  both  clock  and  command 
LVDS are within the specification. The duty cycle of the decoded 40 MHz clock is within the specification 
of (50 –
 ?4)%. The clock jitter is also within the specification, < 1.0 ns, as shown in Figure 9. The rise and 
fall  times  of  both  clock  and  command  are  under  1  ns  and  the  delay  of  the  command  with  respect  to  the 
clock  is  within  the  specification.  DORIC  thresholds  for  no  bit  errors  as  measured  on  the  test  board  are 
typically under ~65 m A. The thresholds as measured on the opto-board are lower, < 20 m A, due to the more 
optimized  board  layout  as  noted  above.  Since  the  thresholds  are  low,  no  capacitors  are  attached  to  the 
dummy input channels for noise cancellation. 

VI.  OPTO-BOARD 

The  VDCs,  DORICs,  and  opto-packs  are  mounted  on  opto-boards.  We  produce  opto-boards  of  two 
flavours with each opto-board serving six or seven modules. To maximize the number of spare opto-boards, 
all opto-boards are fabricated to serve seven modules. For the outer barrel layer and the disk system each 
module  requires  one  link  for  transmitting  data,  therefore  each  opto-board  contains  two  VDCs  plus  one 
VCSEL array optical-package (opto-pack) on the top side and two DORICs plus one PIN array opto-pack 
on the bottom side. The inner barrel (B) layer is expected to have a higher hit occupancy, therefore each 
module requires two links for transmitting data to the ROD. The top side hence contains four VDCs plus 
two VCSEL array opto-packs with each pair of links serving a module connected to adjacent fibers in an 8-
fiber ribbon. 

 

4 

The layout of the opto-boards is shown in Figure 10. The bottom layout is the same for both opto-board 
flavours.  The  supply  voltages  are  connected  via  the  80-pin  connector  on  the  bottom  side.  The  input  and 
output LVDS are also fed through the connector. The opto-board is fabricated with beryllium oxide (BeO) 
as the substrate for heat management. On the bottom side, no component is placed between the connector 
and the mounting hole near the edge of the board to allow for thermal contact with the cooling pipe. 

We initially prototyped the opto-boards using FR-4 as the substrate for fast turnaround and cost saving. 
Four prototype runs were submitted to accommodate changes in the chips and opto-pack design. We had 
two  prototype  submissions  with  BeO.  The  first  vendor  produced  opto-boards  with  many  open  vias  and 
shorts between traces. However, the second vendor [6] was able to produce opto-boards of high quality. We 
observe  low  PIN  current  thresholds  for  no  bit  errors  when  all  links  are  active,  indicating  that  there  is  no 
significant cross talk on the opto-board.  

VII.  IRRADIATION STUDIES 

We have irradiated VDCs and DORICs from three deep submicron submissions with 24 GeV protons at 
CERN.  We  use  two  setups  during  each  irradiation.  In  the  first  setup  (“cold  box”),  we  perform  electrical 
testing  of  VDCs  and  DORICs  at  a  controlled  temperature  of  -10  oC.  No  optical  components  (VCSEL  or 
PIN)  are  used,  allowing  direct  study  of  the  possible  degradation  of  the  chips  without  additional 
complications from the optical components. For the VDCs, we monitor the rise and fall times and the bright 
and dim currents. For the DORICs, we monitor the minimum input current for no bit errors, clock jitter and 
duty cycle, rise and fall times and the amplitude and average of the recovered clock and command LVDS. 

In the second setup (“shuttle”), we test the performance of the opto-link using opto-boards. The opto-
boards  mounted  in  this  setup  may  be  remotely  moved  in  and  out  of  the  beam  target  area.  In  the  control 
room,  we  generate  bi-phase  mark  encoded  pseudo-random  signals  for  transmission  via  25  m  of  optical 
fibers  to  the  opto-boards.  The  PIN  diodes  on  the  opto-boards  convert  the  optical  signals  into  electrical 
signals.  The  DORICs  then  decode  the  electrical  signals  to  extract  the  clock  and  command  LVDS.  The 
LVDS  are  fed  into  the  VDCs  and  converted  into  signals  that  are  appropriate  to  drive  the  VCSELs.  The 
optical  signals  are  then  sent  back  to  the  control  room  for  comparison  with  the  generated  signals.  We 
remotely move the opto-boards on the shuttle out of the beam to anneal the VCSELs. We typically irradiate 
the opto-boards for 10 hours (~5 Mrad), then anneal the VCSELs for the rest of the day with large current 
(~14 mA or higher in the last irradiation depending on the effective resistance of the VCSEL). 

We report the result from the last irradiation using VDCs and DORICs from the production run.  

In  the  cold  box,  we  irradiated  four  DORICs  and  four  VDCs  in  summer  of  2003.  We  observe  no 
significant degradation in the chip performance up to a total dose of ~61 Mrad, except the average of the 
clock  LVDS  of  one  DORIC,  which  increases  by  10%,  an  acceptable  change.  Some  examples  of 
comparisons  of  the  performance  before  and  after  irradiation  are  shown  below.  Figure  11  shows  a 
comparison of the bright and dim currents of the VDCs. Figures 12 and 13 show a comparison of the rise 
and fall times of the decoded clock of the DORICs.  

In the shuttle setup, we irradiated four opto-boards with the dosage of (8-12) x 1014 p/cm2 (22-32 Mrad) 
in summer of 2004. We observe that the PIN current thresholds for no bit errors are all below 40 m A and 
remain  constant  or  decrease  slightly  up  to  the  total  dosage  of  25  Mrad,  as  shown  for  one  opto-board  in 
Figure 14. We also measured bit errors during spills to calculate the single event upset (SEU) cross section. 
Using the estimated particle flux at the location of the  opto-board on the pixel detector (2 x 106 s-1cm-2) 
and SEU cross section, we calculate the bit error rate (BER) as a function of PIN current. The bit error rate 
decreases with PIN current as expected, as shown in Figure 15 for one of the opto-boards. The BER at 100 
m A PIN current is ~3 x 10-10. Since the DORIC BER is < 10-11, the opto-link BER is limited by SEU. 

The  optical  power  from  the  opto-boards  were  monitored  in  the  control  room  during  the  irradiation. 
Figure 16 shows the optical power as a function of time (dosage) for one opto-board. We observe a general 
trend in the data: during the irradiation the optical power decreases; the optical power increases during the 
annealing,  as  expected.  The  power  loss  is  due  to  radiation  damage  to  the  VCSELs  as  the  VDCs  and 
DORICs  show  no  radiation  damage  with  up  to  ~61  Mrad  of  irradiation.  The  power  in  all  channels  are 
significantly above 350 m W, the specification for absolute minimum power after irradiation. We received 
the  opto-boards  from  CERN  two  months  after  irradiation  and  have  measured  their  electrical  and  optical 

 

5 

properties.  After  ~160  hours  of  annealing  at  the  VCSEL  current  of  ~14  mA,  the  optical  power  of  all 
channels were above 1000 m W, hence well above the minimum requirement. 

The optical rise and fall times satisfy the specification, < 1.0 ns, as shown in Figure 17. For the clock 
and command LVDS, the amplitude and average are within the acceptable range and the rise and fall times 
are below 1.0 ns as shown in Figures 18, 19 and 20. There is no significant degradation in clock duty cycle. 
A few channels are slightly above the desired range of (50 –
 ?4)% as shown in Figure 21. The clock jitter is 
under 1.0 ns as shown in Figure 22. 

In summary, the irradiation results show that the VDC and DORIC have no significant degradation up 

to a dose of 61 Mrad, hence are adequate for the pixel detector opto-link.  

We  have  developed  VDC  and  DORIC  circuits  in  the  deep  submicron  (0.25  m m)  technology  using 
enclosed  layout  transistors  and  guard  rings  for  improved  radiation  hardness.  The  circuits  meet  all  the 
requirements for operation in the ATLAS pixel optical link and appear to be sufficiently radiation hard for 
ten years of operation at the LHC.

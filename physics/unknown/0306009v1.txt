Abstract 
    A classical representation of an extended body over barriers of height 

 

greater than the energy of the incident body is shown to have many features 

in common with quantum tunneling as the center-of-mass literally goes 

through the barrier.  It is even classically possible to penetrate any finite 

barrier with a body of arbitrarily low energy if the body is sufficiently long.  

A distribution of body lengths around the de Broglie wavelength leads to 

reasonable agreement with the quantum transmission coefficient. 

 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Quantum mechanics gives the best representation known of the atomic and 

subatomic world.  Classical mechanics has been assumed to be incapable of 

representing tunneling and other phenomena which have been presumed to be 

uniquely in the quantum domain.  This paper is presented in the spirit of 

Gryzinski (1965, 1972, 1973a,b), who showed that a semiclassical understanding 

of the atom, atomic collisions , and molecular forces becomes more reasonable as 

the classical model is refined.  It is our goal to show that quantum tunneling is 

also amenable to properly constructed classical analogs.  Consideration of an 

object having length (rather than being a point mass) will yield a classical 

explanation or analog to the concept of tunneling.  Further consideration of a 

distribution of lengths will yield an analog or counterpart to the quantum 

tunneling coefficient. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

There have been a number of quasiclassical approaches to quantum 

mechanics (utilizing mechanisms such as background fluctuations) in which the 

Schrödinger equation and the Klein-Gordon equation have been derived (Bohm, 

1952; Aron, 1965, 1966; Nelson, 1966; Lehr and Park, 1977; Park et al., 1980).  Once 

this has been achieved, tunneling is introduced in the same way as in quantum 

mechanics with no classical insight as to how a body can get through a barrier 

when its energy is less than that of the barrier height.  Bohm (1952) has some of 

the particles going over the barrier due to "violent fluctuations in the quantum 

mechanical potential."  Others have particles hopping over the barrier due to 

thermal fluctuations. 

 

To our knowledge, no one has previously shown that there is a direct 

classical analog to quantum tunneling.  Texts typically state:  "This possibility of 

going through potential barriers – called the tunnel effect – makes it possible to 

understand in terms of quantum mechanics a number of atomic phenomena that 

are inexplicable classically" (Rojansky, 1964).  This paper will show that an 

extended body can yield a classical representation of tunneling which has many 

of the quantum mechanical features. 

 

Our paradigm is that of "high jumping" rather than tunneling for any force 

field.  In the case of a gravitational field, the process is like that of a high jumper 

whose center of gravity does not have to be raised to the height of the bar in 

order for the jumper to clear the bar.  The high jumper's body does not need to 

have an energy greater than or equal to that of the jumper's entire weight times 

the barrier height, since those parts of the body already over the barrier drop to a 

lower potential energy as the body crosses the barrier.  In essence, our view is 

that tunneling may also be regarded as high jumping of an extended body which 

can clear a barrier even when its energy is less than the potential energy of the 

barrier, if it can communicate with and be aided by the interaction on the other 

 

 

 

side of the barrier.  The siphon analog is also appropriate.  For a one-dimensional 

barrier, the body need not be flexible.  In higher dimensions the extended body 

should be flexible, and we call it a "rope" for convenience. 
  
2.  QUANTUM MECHANICAL TUNNELING 

 

Let us first establish some properties of quantum mechanical tunneling with 

which to compare the classical high-jumping results.  It is noteworthy that the 

quantum mechanical representation for a point particle is essentially a wave 

equation.  In terms of the quantum wave-particle duality, tunneling deals only 

with the wave nature of an object, as the absence of localization precludes 

dealing with the object's particle nature.  A wave has distributed energy and 

hence distributed equalivalent mass.  In the conventional interpretation of 

quantum mechanics this possible inconsistency with the concept of a point 

particle is circumvented by interpreting the wave intensity as a probability 

distribution for finding the point particle. 

The stationary solution of tunneling is obtained by solving the Schrödinger 

equation on the incident side of the barrier, inside the barrier, and on the 

transmitted side of the barrier:

For a one-dimensional square barrier of width w and potential energy 

(height) B (Figure 1 with vertical sides, i.e., a = b = 0) solution of the Schrödinger 

equation yields the transmission coefficient:

/ h, E is the energy of the incident particle, and m is its 

mass.  Note that quantum mechanically where E < B, the momentum of the 

particle is imaginary and its kinetic energy is negative inside the barrier.  As 
w → 0, TT* → 1 for finite B, and as   w → ∞ , TT* → 0 .  Similarly, as E → 0, 
TT* → 0 , for w ≠  0.  When w = 0, TT* = 1, as E → 0.  For any general barrier, the 

transmission coefficient TT* and amplitude T are the same in all direction for a 

free particle (cf. Appendix B).  The reflection coefficient has the same magnitude 

for all directions of incidence on the barrier, but the reflection amplitudes do not 

all have the same phase (cf. Appendix B). 
 
3.  CLASSICAL HIGH JUMPING 

 

Now let us compare the above quantum tunneling results with classical 

high jumping for a nonabsorbing trapezoidal barrier of height (maximum 

potential energy) B, top width w, and total width w + a+ b as defined by Figure 1.  

This is a fairly general barrier, as, by appropriate choice of w, a, and b, a square, 

triangular, or line barrier can also be represented.  Solutions may be readily 

obtained by conservation of energy, as shown here, though any of a number of 

methods may be used. 

 

 

 

 

 

Equating the energy E of the rope in the zero potential energy region to its 

potential energy when it can just barely get over the barrier, we have in general  
E =
  

, where ρ(x) is the appropriate linear density (mass density for a 

ρVdx

L∫
0

gravitational field, charge density for an electric field, etc.) of the rope of length L 

for the particular field.  For the potential V - V(x) of Figure 1 (Vo is the maximum 

potential) there are three solution regimes:  EShort for 0 < L < w; EMedium for 

w < L < w + a + b; and ELong for L > w + a + b:

L1 and L2 are the equilibrium lengths of the medium rope which extend over 

either side of the top of the barrier.  In the long-rope case, G1 and G2 are the 

lengths of the rope on either side of the barrier edges at zero potential.   

The solutions to equations (3) - (5) for the energy that the body must have to 

just clear the barrier of Figure 1 are

The solutions (6) - (8) give the minimal energy E that a rope of length L 

needs to clear (penetrate) the barrier.  Just as in the dase of quantum tunneling, it 

is possible to clear the barrier even if E < B.  Since the solutions are symmetric in 

a and b, high jumping is the same in both directions, as is tunneling (cf. 

Appendix B).  Another of many similarities is that when w → ∞ , E must be ≥  B

to go over the barrier.  Of course, when 0 ≤ L ≤ w ≠ 0, E ≥ B  for clearing the 

barrier. 

As can be seen from Appendix A, there are many more interesting 

correlations with quantum mechanics at even this stage of the analysis.  So far, 

we have established that it is possible for a body whose energy is less than its 

potential energy at the top of a barrier to cross (high jump) the barrier, provided 

the body is an extended object, as an analog to quantum mechanics.  However, 

the high-jumping coefficient at this stage is only 0 or 1.  As can be seen in the 

next section, the analog may be taken even further.   
 
4.  LINK BETWEEN CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM BARRIER PENETRATION 

 

The probabilistic nature of quantum tunneling is recovered if we assume 

that there is a distribution of rope lengths.  Equations (7) and (8) should be 

interpreted as relationships giving L, the minimum rope length needed for 

barrier penetration, in terms of E, B, w, and a + b.  For simplicity, consider the 

square barrier with a = b = 0; then for E < B equation (8) is operative and can be 

rewritten as 
 

 

 

 

 

 

L = Bw / E

Only those ropes with length x ≥  L as given by equation (9) will go over the 

barrier, and those smaller than L will not.  One would anticipate that in order to

A normalized distribution we find, with a most probable value at D 4 / 3 ,

5.  CONCLUSION 

Thus, if the assumption "that the body length is zero" is not made for a body 

incident on a barrier, then "tunneling" need no longer be considered a purely 

quantum effect, as classical "high jumping" gives analogous results.  Based upon 

the analysis in this paper, it can be seen directly how it is possible for a body to 

appear on the other side of a barrier even when its incident energy is less than its 

potential energy at the top of the barrier.  Although the entire body goes over the 

barrier, its center of mass and/or center of interaction literally go through the 

barrier. 

 

This model illustrates that a classical system can exhibit what were thought 

to be quintessential quantum mechanical properties when its energy is spatially 

distributed over a sufficiently large distance and is coherently coupled.  In the 

macroscopic world, the body length may take on a large range of values as an 

independent variable.  In the microcosm, only those body lengths distributed 

around the de Broglie wavelength lead to reasonable agreement with the 

quantum transmission coefficient. 
 
APPENDIX A.  INTERESTING FEATURES OF ROPE SOLUTIONS 

Even before a statistical aspect is introduced, there are a number of 

interesting features of the simple rope solutions that may be nonintuitive. 

1.  For L > 0, as the barrier gets infinitesimally thin, i.e., ++w, it is possible to 

penetrate the barrier even as 

0→E

.  At first sight this classical result may be 

surprising and even appear a bit quantum mechanical.  It may be understood by 

realizing that as the barrier gets thinner for a fixed length of rope L, the fraction 

of the rope's kinetic energy that is converted to potential energy gets 

correspondingly smaller.  In the limit of an infinitesimally thin barrier ( a line 

barrier), this fraction of the rope's energy goes to zero.  Thus the rope can make it 

over a large but finite barrier of height B, even though the rope has an arbitrarily 

small amount of energy.  This is the same as the quantum limit for an 

infinitesimally thin barrier of finite height as 

0→E

, since 

* →TT

. 

 

 

 

 

2.  As in quantum mechanics, for a finite barrier of width w > 0, when E = 0, 

classical high jumping cannot clear the barrier.  However, E can get indefinitely 

small (but not =0) in successfully clearing the barrier as 

∞→L

 (holding the total 

charge, mass, etc., fixed as would be the case for a fundamental particle).  The 

reason is similar to that of feature 1, because the fraction of the rope's energy that 

is potential energy 

0→  as 

∞→L

.  For quantum tunneling, whenever w > 0, 

* →TT

0

 as 

0→E

. 

 

3.  For a point body of L = 0, 

 to clear the barrier.  However, the limit 

BE ≥

of 

0→L

 approaching a point body has unexpected solutions.  With 

0=w

 as +, 

equation (7) reduces to B(1 - f/2) in the limit as 

0→L

, where  

f = L/(a + b) and 

0

≤ f

≤

1

.  This yields BEB/.  For 

1≥f

, equation (8) reduces to fBE/=, 

yielding BE.  With a + b = 0 as w → 0, equation (6) or (7) gives E = B for L < w.  

However, for /gLw, equation (8) reduces to E = gB and thus 0 < E < B. 
 
APPENDIX B.  SYMMETRY AND ASYMMETRY OF QUANTUM TUNNELING 

 

Establishing some general properties of quantum mechanical tunneling 

facilitates a comparison with the classical high-jumping results.  Consider a general 

one-dimensional barrier of potential energy 

)(xV

 between two regions of zero 

potential.  We have the following solutions of the Schrödinger equation (S-eq.) on 

 

Region 1: 

the incident (Region 1) and transmitted sides (Region 2) of the barrier. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

  Ψ(x) = eikx + Re

Ψ(x) = Teikx  

Region 2: 

−ikx

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(B1) 

(B2) 

where k is the wave vector, RR* is the reflection coefficient, and TT* is the 

transmission coefficient.  For a wave incident on the barrier in the opposite 

 

 

 

direction ψ(x) = Ψ(−x) is the solution of the S-eq. with V(-x) replacing V(x).  The 

 

Region 1: 

solutions in regions 1 and 2 are as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

ikx + Re

ψ(x) = e

Region 2: 

 

ψ(x) = Teikx = Ψ(−x)  
  

 

 

 

(B3) 

ikx = Ψ(−x)  

  (B4) 

 

For a nonabsorbing barrier, V is real.  Therefore a solution of the S-eq. with 

 

V(x) is 
 
 
 
where, for Region 1 
 
 
 
and for Region 2 
 
 
 

 

 

Ψ(x) = [−R * /T*]ψ(x) + [1/ T*]ψ * (x) 
  

Ψ(x) = eikx + [−R * T / T*]eikx  

  Ψ(x) = [(1 − RR*) / T*]eikx = Teikx

 

  (B5) 

  (B6) 

  (B7) 

 

Therefore the transmission amplitude T and the phase are the same in the 

two directions, i.e., quantum mechanical tunneling is symmetric with respect to 

direction.  Although the reflection amplitude R, in Region 2 has the same 

magnitude R as in Region 1,

, it does not in general have the 

same phase. 
 
APPENDIX C.  DISCUSSION OF CLASSICAL PENETRATION 

 

Our concept of particles as extended objects having lengths distributed 

about the de Broglie wavelength warrants consideration with respect to 

descriptions of particles as "waves and particles simultaneously," compared with 

complementarity.  The direct statistical nature of barrier penetration in our 

 

 

model warrants further study and reflection with respect to the possibility of 

directly detecting de Broglie waves (Garuccio et al., 1981).  In fact, the length 

scale corresponding to the de Broglie length ( D  here) may be inferred from the 

distribution of rope lengths as related to the high-jumping energy.  This is 

analogous to the relationship between the Bohr radius and the energy levels of 

the Bohr model of the atom, where the Bohr radius is equal to  D  for the ground 

state of a hydrogenic atom. 

 

At the very least, classical high jumping can provide a physical insight into 

quantum tunneling.  This may have value in the sense that if Bohr had created 

the Bohr model of the atom after atomic energy levels had already been 

calculated from the Schrödinger equation, his model would still provide valuable 

insights into what would otherwise be an abstract mathematical process. 

 

One difficulty of the classical rope analysis is that it is discontinuous at E = 

B, requiring all particles to penetrate E > B.  However, the quantum result is 

continuous at E = B, with partial reflection for E > B.  The formal extension of 

equation (12) into the Region E > B does approximate the general trend of the 

quantum solution, though it does not contain its oscillatory character.  A more 

complete analysis should consider the combined effects of varying rope lengths 

and internal energy conversion.  The latter could result when the leading edge of 

the rope is incident on the barrier and kinetic energy of translation would couple 

to internal energy, and thus account for reflection when E ≥ B .  In the one-

dimensional case, the internal energy can only be oscillational.  In two or more 

dimensions, the internal energy could also be rotational. 

 

When quantum mechanics deals with an extended body with distributed 

mass, the additional terms in the Hamiltonian related to the potentially new 

degrees of freedom such as oscillation and rotation about the center of mass are 

represented in the Schrödinger equation.  Even if they were to be included, it is 

 

 

not clear that their contribution would materially affect the solution.  For 

example, for objects such as an electron, rotational excited states require a high 

energy input for excitation.  Hence they are not present under ordinary 

circumstances.  A barrier only appears immutable when a model is constructed 

of a point particle interacting with a given barrier.

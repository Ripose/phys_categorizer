ABSTRACT 

    We describe an electrospray technique for in situ preparation, for differential scanning calorimetry 

study, of samples of molecular liquids quenched into the glassy state on extremely short time scales 

(hyperquenched).  We  study  the  case  of  propylene  glycol  PG  in  some  detail.  Using  a  fictive 

temperature method of obtaining the temperature dependence of enthalpy relaxation, we show that the 
electrospray method yields quenching rates of ~105 K/s, while the more common method, dropping a 

sealed pan of sample into liquid nitrogen, yields only 120 K/s. Hyperquenched samples start to relax 

exothermically  far  below  the  glass  temperature,  at  a  temperature  where  the  thermal  energy  permits 

escape  from  the  shallow  traps  in  which  the  system  becomes  localized  during  hyperquenching.  This 

permits estimation of the trap depths, which are then compared with the activation energy estimated 

from the fictive temperature of the glass and the relaxation time at the fictive temperature. The trap 

depth in molar energy units is compared with the "height of the landscape" for PG, the quasi-lattice 

energy of the liquid based on the enthalpy of vaporization, and the single molecule activation energy 

for  diffusion  in  hydrogen  bonded  crystals.  The  implications  for  the  topography  of  the  energy 

landscape and the mechanism of its exploration, are considered.

I. INTRODUCTION 

  
    In recent studies we  1,2, and others  3,4, have stressed the importance of laboratory hyperquenching 

strategies in clarifying the physics of glassforming systems. Not only does vitrification on very short 

time  scales  help  bridge  the  current  gap  between  computer  simulation  investigations  of  supercooled 

liquids and their experimental counterparts, but it provides glassy materials in much higher states of 

configurational excitation than have previously been studied in appropriate detail. The properties  of 

high fictive temperature glasses appear to differ in important ways from those of normal glasses, and 

elucidating  these  differences  will  be  important  in  refining  our  understanding  of  the  structure  and 

energetics of the viscous liquid, and of the vitrification process itself. 

    The  aging  process  in  glasses,  both  of  spin  and  structural  types,  has  recently  been  the  subject  of 
intense  study  5-8.  The  studies  on  glasses  performed  by  molecular  dynamics  methods  7,8  have  been 

conducted  on  time  scales  of  tens  of  ns,  utilizing  glasses  formed  on  tenths  of  ns  timescales.  Current 
work  9 is extending these time scales to the microsecond domain. By contrast, laboratory studies  of 

aging have been largely conducted on glasses formed on the time scale of minutes, and aged on the 

time scale of days and weeks. By forming the glasses on very short time scales, however, the aging 
process  can  be  observed  at  much  lower  temperatures  10,11  or,  alternatively,  on  much  shorter  time 
scales  at  higher  aging  temperatures  12.  By  studying  the  onset  of  relaxation  of  the  hyperquenched 
glasses during reheating, the depth of the trap in which the glass was  arrested can be determined  2. 
Then, by appropriate thermochemical methods (detailed below and elsewhere  1,3), the temperature at 

which the system was arrested during the hyperquench can be obtained. Thus hyperquenching studies, 

which in the past have been used almost exclusively to vitrify systems that normally crystallize, can 
provide  information  on  the  energetics  of  the  "liquid  landscape"  13,14  in  energy  ranges  approaching 

those  involved  in  computer  simulation  studies.  In  particular  the  hyperquenching  studies  provide 

access, or at least close approach, to the very interesting "crossover" region that is currently much in 
focus for the case of fragile liquids 15-18. 

    Hyperquenching studies, like their computer simulation counterparts, depend for their usefulness on 

the very large gap in the time scales on which the distinct vibrational and configurational degrees of 

freedom of a viscous liquid are explored. This separability of degrees of freedom is manifested most 
directly  in  the  familiar  glass  transition15b,19  at  which  the  configurational,  but  not  the  vibrational, 

contribution  to  the  liquid  heat  capacity  drops  out.  It  drops  out  because  its  exploration  time  scale 

 

 

 

2 

exceeds  that  of  the  heat  capacity-determining  experiment.  In  effect,  the  system  becomes  trapped  in 
one of the immense number of minima on the potential energy hypersurface in configuration space 20-
22, and thereafter resembles a crystal (single structure) system, in that only vibrational modes can be 

excited. 

  For  glasses  formed  at  normal  rates  we  can 

ignore  a  frequently  studied  but 

thermodynamically very weak "secondary relaxation". However between the normal glass transition 
and the crossover temperature this secondary process is considered to become rapidly stronger  13,  15 

and to become the dominant relaxation process at Tc. One of the aims of hyperquenching studies is to 

elucidate this striking inversion. 

    Although  the  glass  transition  is  usually  observed  and  recorded  during  heating  experiments,  it  is 

more rationally defined during cooling experiments and certainly it is the cooling glass transition that 

is  of  interest  in  hyperquenching  experiments.  Because  the  numerical  value  of  the  glass  transition 

temperature during rapid cooling must be obtained by studies made after the glass has been formed, it 
is usually referred to by a distinct name, the "fictive" temperature 23. In the simulation community, the 
alternative  term  "internal"  temperature  is  also  used  5-8,  though  the  latter  is  also  defined  from  the 

behavior  of  the  glass  below  Tg,  rather  than  estimated  by  the  method  of  this,  and  related,  papers. 
Velikov et al  24 have shown that the fictive temperature and the midpoint cooling glass temperature 

are almost identical in value, at least for single component systems. 

    The  process  of  maintaining  full  equilibrium  in  a  liquid  (excluding  crystallization  if  this  is  a 

possibility) involves the exploration of the potential energy "landscape". So also does the process of 

approaching  equilibrium.  For  equilibrium  to  be  established,  the  system  point  must  move  between  a 

large  enough  subset  of  the  basins  at  the  appropriate  level  on  the  landscape  effectively  to  have 

explored them all. What is happening during this exploration process that is needed to establish a true 

equilibrium  between  kinetic  and  potential  energies?  Clearly  the  degrees  of  freedom  must 

communicate. There must be an exchange of energy between the phonon and configuron microstates 

of the system. At equilibrium, the forward and reverse exchange rates between these microstates must 

be  the  same.  Otherwise  the  system  is  said  to  be  annealing,  and  its  properties  are  time-dependent. 

Likewise,  when  the  phonon-configuron  exchange,  which  is  responsible  for  maintaining  equilibrium 

during cooling, becomes too slow, and the system becomes non-ergodic as in glass formation. 

    The energy of the basin in which the system becomes trapped during continuous cooling is higher 

the  higher  the  cooling  rate.  The  potential  energy  of  the  trapped  state  can  be  depicted  for  different 

 

 

 

 

3 

cooling rates, as in Fig. 1, in which the fictive temperatures are also indicated. Note that Tf  relates to 

potential energy while the "real" temperature relates to kinetic energy. When the two temperatures are 

the same, the system is a liquid. Otherwise it is a glass.

trapped during quenching and the rate of the quench. 

 

    While  fictive  temperatures  often  can  be  determined  by  observations  made  during  cooling,  this 

becomes difficult or impossible when the cooling rate are high. Then the fictive temperature can be 

assessed  by  calorimetric  measurements  performed  on  the  quenched  glass  during  its  reheating,  as 
described in detail in recent papers 1,3 which relate back to early studies by Moynihan and co-workers 
25. We will illustrate these features in the present work in which we report on the adaptation of  the 

electrospray  technique  for  differential  scanning  calorimetry  studies  of  the  hyperquenched  glassy 

systems. We adopt the much-studied glassformer 1, 2-propandiol (propylene glycol, PG) as our trial 

substance and use the data obtained to show how features of the potential energy hypersurface, that 

are not obvious from ergodic measurements, can be revealed.

II. EXPERIMENT 

    Much  attention  has  been  given  to  different  methods  of  quenching  liquid  systems  at  high  rates, 
mostly for the purpose vitrifying liquid metals or refining the grain size of crystalline materials 26, but 

no review will be given here. A technique that has been utilized for the above purpose, but which has 

also  been  used  to  produce  finely  divided  systems  (including  those  containing  proteins)  for  mass 
spectrometric analysis, is that of electrospraying  27. In this technique, a metered flow of liquid  self-

subdivides into very fine droplets, as it emerges from a fine needle orifice, under the mutual repulsion 

of electrons that are driven onto the liquid surface by a high electrostatic field. It can be refined to the 
point where even liquid silicon can be obtained as vitreous droplets 28. It is extremely well suited for 

producing  small  samples  of  liquids  sprayed  directly  into  cold  pans  in  the  dry  environment  of  the 

typical  differential  scanning  calorimeter  sample  housing,  and  it  has  therefore  been  the  technique 

adopted by us for hyperquenching studies.

    The experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 2.  The 1.0 ml capacity syringe, driven by controlled rate 

stepper motor, supplies liquid through a short length of 0.030† · 1/16† peek tubing and adaptor to a 

0.004† · 0.009† stainless steel needle. The adaptor inserts through the upper perspex plate of the DSC 

sample head dry box. It inserts directly over an aluminum sample pan that sits on a cold aluminum 

support  rod  in  contact  with  liquid  nitrogen  which  is  funneled  into  the  mini  bath  shortly  before 

spraying is to commence. High voltage is applied between the aluminum rod and the syringe needle, 

the latter contact being simply accomplished by having the syringe needle drop through the splayed 

end of a multifilament wire lead secured to the dry-box housing. 

    The voltage, controlled between 6000 and 15, 000 V, is best provided by a power supply designed 

to have maximum current flows that are non-hazardous on direct contact. Voltages higher than 12,000 

V produced corona discharges in the dry box atmosphere of N2. This arcing can be suppressed in a 
CO2  atmosphere  29  and  this  will  clearly  be  needed  in  order  to  spray  high  surface  tension  aqueous 
systems satisfactorily  30. The steady flow of liquid, which is an important control parameter  27,  was 

provided by a stepper-motor-driven syringe, the step rate itself being under precise control. The flow 

rates found best are in the range of 3 – 15 ml/min. 

    Each  liquid  sprays  optimally  under  different  voltage  and  flow  rate  conditions  -  which  must  be 

determined  empirically.  While  we  have  not  yet  electrosprayed  water  effectively,  we  find  that  the 

lower  surface  tension,  but  still  hydrogen-bonded,  liquid  propylene  glycol,  has  very  satisfactory 

electrospraying characteristics, and we use it for our initial studies. 

    To utilize the hyperquenched samples for study of the quenched-in state, and its relaxation to the 

normal state, we compare the thermal behavior of the hyperquenched sample with a "standard scan" 
of  the  same  sample.  The  standard  scan  1,24,31  is  one  in  which  the  heat  flow  is  measured  during  an 

upscan at the standard scan rate of 20 K/min after preparing the sample initially by cooling it through 

the glass transformation range at 20 K/min. For the comparison, the quenched sample is upscanned at 

the standard rate, and the two scans are superposed using the data at temperatures (i) below that of the 

relaxation  onset  of  the  quenched  sample,  and  (ii)  above  the  glass  transformation  range,  T  >1.1Tg, 

(where all traces of the sample history disappear) to adjust any slope discrepancies.

III. RESULTS 

    In Figure 3 we compare standard scan and quenched sample scans for two cases quenched at two 

different rates. The upper pair of curves is for a sample that was initially quenched by dropping it, in a 

hermetically sealed aluminum pan, into a bath of liquid nitrogen, before cold transfer to the DSC head 

for upscan. The lower pair is for a sample that was electrosprayed into an open DSC pan, as described 

in  the  previous  section,  before  cold  transfer  to  the  DSC  head.  The  difference  between  the  energies 

trapped in the two cases is immediately seen, by the much larger area lying between the standard scan 

and the quenched scan in the case of the electosprayed sample.

Figure 3. Comparison of the upscan (at standard scan rate) of quenched samples with standard samples 

for  the  case  of  propylene  glycol.  The  upper  pair  is  for  a  sample,  in  sealed  pan,  dropped  into  liquid 

nitrogen,  while  the  lower  pair  is  for  electrosprayed  sample  in  open  pan.  The  much  larger  frozen-in 

enthalpy of the lower case is seen in the much larger area between the two scans for this case. 

    The effect of changing the cooling rate, under instrument control, between 5 and 40 K/s can be seen 

in Fig. 4. At these much lower cooling rates the difference between standard and non- standard scans 

is seen mainly in the immediate vicinity of the glass transition, whereas in the case of higher quench 

 

 

 

 

 

rates the difference is manifested at increasingly lower temperatures. The origin of this distinction will 

be discussed in the next section.  

    Fig. 4 is used to obtain the data needed to estimate the quench rate from the data of Fig. 2. The way 

in which the areas between standard scan and scans at other non-standard cooling rates can be used 
(see Fig. 4 inset) to obtain the fictive temperatures has been described adequately elsewhere 1,3,31 and 

need not be repeated in detail here.

values as scaling parameters. The dash curve is the plot of dielectric relaxation times (from ref. 34), 
s, and used to guide the extrapolation to the 

which are matched to the fictive temperature data near Tf

reduced fictive temperature of the hyperquenched sample. The value of the reduced quenching rate at 
this latter reduced fictive temperature yields a quench rate for the hyperquenched sample of ~ 105 K/s. 

The parameters of the well-known Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation for dielectric relaxation 

times of PG are listed in the legend. The parameters of the Arrhenius equation for the reduced fictive 

temperature plot give directly the m-fragility value for PG, as discussed in ref. 31. 

 

 

 
    The data of Fig. 5, guided by the form of the dielectric relaxation temperature dependence 34 which 

is  shown  as  a  dashed  line  in  Fig.  5,  can  now  be  used  to  estimate  the  hyperquenching  rate.  This  is 

obtained from the intersection with a vertical line representing the scaled fictive temperature obtained 

for the hyperquenched sample, by the same area integration method. The fictive temperature is found 
to be 195 K, or 1.15 Tg. According to Fig. 5, this indicates a quenching rate of nearly 105 K/s after 

taking account of the cooling rate of the standard scan, 0.33 K/s. The quench rate we obtain is close to 
the value estimated for the aerosol droplet method of Mayer 36, applied to the case of di-ols by Mayer 
and coworkers 12. Indeed, the temperature at which the (incomplete) upscan of the hyperquenched PG 
glass in ref. 12 departs from the plots for standard scans 3, is the same as ours to within the uncertainty 

9 

of determination. In considering the reliability of the Figure 5 estimate of the quenching rate obtained 

in the electrosprayed sample, it should be borne in mind that the dielectric relaxation times coincide 
with the ac heat capacity-based relaxation times for PG  35 in the four decade range over which they 

overlap. (from 4.5 to -0.2 on the -logt  scale). 

    By  comparison,  the  liquid  nitrogen  sealed  pan  quench  is  very  slow.  The  fictive  temperature 

obtained from Fig. 2 (upper curves) is only 8.5 K above the standard value of 169 K and this yields, 

from Fig. 5, a quenching rate of only 120 K/s. Nevertheless, this is a useful quenching rate for some 

purposes, being 24 times faster than the fastest quench obtainable in the DSC itself (5 K/s). 

IV. DISCUSSION  

 

 
A. Calorimetric quantification of initial trap energy level 

    Using the data of Fig. 3, we can now proceed to estimate the energy, and depth, of the trap in which 
the sample was arrested during the hyperquench at 105 K/s. The energy of the trap minimum relative 

to that for the trap in which the standard glass resides, has already been obtained in finding the fictive 

temperature.  This  energy  gap,  given  by  the  area  between  the  hyperquenched  and  standard  scans  of 

Fig. 3, amounts to 1.9 kJ/mole. This is not a useful figure without some relevant scale of energies to 

which to refer. The most relevant comparisons are with (a) the enthalpy of fusion (b) the enthalpy of 

exciting the liquid from the glass temperature to the melting point and (c) the enthalpy of exciting the 

liquid from the Kauzmann temperature to the boiling point. The value of (a) is not available for 1, 2-

propandiol, which is extremely difficult to crystallize, but is known for the 1,3 isomer for which it is 

12.9 kJ/mol. The value for the 1,2-isomer, when measured, will be similar but smaller: we estimate 

12.6 kJ/mol.  The values of the enthalpies (b) and (c) can be estimated from the relations

The respective values are 3.69 kJ/mol, and 25 kJ/mol. The latter, which is only approximate for the 

reasons given below, can be taken as a crude measure of the "height of the energy landscape" for the 

 

 

10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

system, which is conceptually simplest for a constant volume system. The relation between excitation 
at constant volume (CV) and excitation at constant pressure has (CP) been considered recently  37,38, 

and it is clear from such considerations that Eq. (2) will overestimate the height of any fixed volume 

landscape. The overestimate contains three components, none of which will be as important for PG as 

for most other molecular liquids.  

    The  first  component  is  due  to  the  higher  heat  capacity  at  constant  pressure  over  the  value  at 
constant volume for which the landscape, and its inherent structures excitation profile, is defined  14. 
The extra heat capacity  (Cp - Cv = VTa2/kT or preferably the configurational part of the difference) 

must  inflate  the  integrand,  but  since  the  expansivity  of  PG  is  among  the  lowest  measured  for 

molecular liquids, while the compressibility is normal, the effect will be small.  

    The second component is due to the changes in the basin shapes that usually occur with level on the 

landscape, and these changes lead to an excess heat capacity over that due to the configurations alone. 
The excess is a positive quantity at CP and negative by about the same amount at CV 38-41. Again, it is 

expected  that  this  source  of  difference  is  quite  small  for  the  case  of  PG  which  is  not  a  very  fragile 

liquid, as seen above.  

    The third component comes from uncertainty about the course of DCp (or DCv) above the melting 

point. (Of course there is no single melting point, and no boiling point at all, at constant volume, and 

we  use  the  terms  only  to  indicate  approximate  points  along  the  excitation  profile  for  the  constant 

volume system - for which a single and unique potential energy hypersurface – or "landscape"- can be 
defined).  ¤Cv  is  expected  to  decrease  and  eventually  to  become  undefinable  as  the  lifetime  of  the 

"structure"  becomes  comparable  with  vibrational  time  scale.  By  contrast,  our  estimate  has  assumed 

the almost constant value of 72.5 J/mol*K observed in the range Tg - Tm.  

    Taking all these factors into account, we can take the height of the landscape for PG, with a volume 

fixed at its value at the glass transition, to be about 20 kJ/mol. A precise number is not necessary for 

our purposes because it is the contrasts with the much smaller trapped-in energy of the hyperquenched 

glass,  and  the  much  larger  magnitude  of  the  activation  energy  for  relaxation,  on  which  we  wish  to 

focus attention. 

  

 

 

 

 

 

11 

    Then  we  can  see  that,  notwithstanding  the  seven  orders  of  magnitude  increase  in  quenching  rate 

that we have imposed, the energy trapped in the hyperquenched glass in excess of the energy of the 

standard glass, is rather small relative to the height of the landscape. It is even small relative to the 

part  of  the  landscape  explored  between  Tg  and  Tm.  This  reflects  the  fact  that  these  7  orders  of 

magnitude in quench rates lie in the regime in which the relaxation time is changing most rapidly with 

the  enthalpy,  and  accordingly  correspond  to  a  relatively  small  enthalpy  change.  A  change  in  the 

quench rate by the same number of orders of magnitude in a computer simulation experiment would 

involve the system in much larger changes of potential energy because of the relatively larger distance 

from the Kauzmann temperature in which such a change is being made. 

B. Calorimetric characterization of the initial trap depth 

    The depth of the basin in which the system is trapped during hyperquenching is a more interesting 

quantity. It can be estimated in two independent ways from the data obtained in this study. Firstly, it 

can be estimated from the temperature at which the trapped-in enthalpy starts to be released during the 

rescan, assuming that the probability of escape from the trap is a Boltzmann function of temperature. 

Secondly,  it  can  be  estimated  from  the  fictive  temperature  with  the  help  of  assumptions  about  the 

"true" activation energy for rate processes in viscous liquids.  For PG, it is found that both approaches 

lead to the same trap depth. 

 
     In the first approach 2 we use the fact, based on experience with the glass transition, that when an 

energy change first commences (at the onset glass transition) during a standard scan (20 K/min), the 

relaxation  time  for  the  energy-changing  process  is  100  s.  The  energy  of  the  barrier  opposing  the 

relaxation can then be obtained by supposing a Boltzmann probability, exp(-Eesc/RT) per attempt, of 
escaping from the trap at the temperature Tesc, and a pre-exponent time constant of 10-14 s, based on 

lattice vibrations.

The trap depth for the present case of hyperquenching, in which Tesc is 125 K, is then 39.9 kJ/mole, an 

energy  very  much  larger  than  the  energy  separating  the  excited  glass  from  the  normal  glass,  as 

calculated above (1.9 kJ/mol).

Figure 6.  Assessment of the activation energy for relaxation of quenched glasses out of their trap 
s/Tf.. Values for the hyperquenched, and pan-quenched 
samples of this study, are shown by open circles. Extrapolation of the straight line construction to 

sites, using the scaled  fictive temperature, Tf

log t  =  2,  predicts  the  temperature  at  which  a  glass  of  this  fictive  temperature  will  start  to  relax 

during warm-up at the standard DSC heating rate of 20 K/min, which are indicated by arrows. 

    Before discussing this value further, we consider the alternative method of assessing the trap depth. 
We argue, following Dyre 42 that, at the fictive temperature, Tf, located at 1.15 Tg, the true activation 

energy for migration should be given by the construction in which the distorting effect of change of 

structure with temperature has been removed. Thus, instead of taking the actual slope of the Arrhenius 

plot for the relaxation time in Fig. 6, the energy barrier opposing the rearrangement of molecules in 

viscous  flow  is  taken  as  2.303R  times  the  slope  of  the  straight  line  joining  the  point  at  Tf  on  the 

13 

relaxation time Arrhenius plot, to the lattice vibration time, 10-14 s. This yields 39.1 kJ/mol for the trap 

depth, which is very close to that from method 1. Indeed this accord can be seen immediately from the 

manner in which the extrapolation of the straight line through the fictive temperature to the time t = 

100 s, yields the temperature 125 K where relaxation begins in Fig. 3. 

 

 

 

 

 

C. Interpretation of the trap depth. 

    The self-consistency of these assessments of the trap depth prompts a  series of further questions. 

For the slower (liquid nitrogen pan immersion) quench (upper plot in Fig.3) the trap depth should be 

greater.  Using  the  fictive  temperature  (again  obtained  from  the  total  energy  evolved)  to  obtain  the 

activation  energy,  we  would  predict  from  Fig.  6  a  recovery  onset  temperature  of  150  K.  The  onset 

temperature  in  Fig.  3  is not  as  well-defined  for  this  case,  but  there  is  clearly  some  weak  relaxation 

below 150 K. This may be due to the spreading out of the relaxation time distribution, which is known 

to increase with decreasing temperature.  

    At the glass temperature itself (i.e. at the fictive temperature of the "standard" glass) the activation 

energy for enthalpy relaxation is obtained as 52 kJ/mol. which is close to the enthalpy of vaporization 
(¤Hv = 56.7 kJ/mol at the boiling point of 460.5 K 43. Before further comment on this correspondence 

it  is  helpful  to  make  some  comparison  with  rate  processes  in  other  hydrogen-bonded  systems, 

preferably other molecules with two H bonding units per molecule. For instance, the activation energy 
for diffusion of water molecules in ice  44, which is an Arrhenius process, is 58.5 kJ/mol. This value, 
which is also obtained for dielectric relaxation, NMR spin-lattice relaxation, and elastic relaxation 44, 

is  greater  than  the  enthalpy  of  vaporization,  40.66  kJ/mol  at  the  boiling  point  of  water.  A  more 
appropriate  comparison  is  with  the  sublimation  energy  which  is  51  kJ/mol  45,46.  The  sublimation 

energy  provides  the  major  component  of  the  derived  lattice  energy  of  ice,  56  kJ/mol  according  to 
Whalley45,47. 

    That the energy fluctuation needed to permit a single particle process like diffusion in a molecular 

crystal  should  be  comparable  to  the  lattice  energy,  should  cause  no  surprise.  It  seems  reasonable 

because  the  relevant  fluctuation  involves  the  expenditure  of  energy  in  deforming  the  lattice 

sufficiently  that  a  molecular  size  void  is  both  available  and  accessible  (written  as  the  product  of 

Boltzmann probabilities for void formation and for "jumping" into the void). The manner in which a 

similar energy fluctuation in an amorphous substance gives rise to diffusion, and thereby to relaxation 

14 

(t » d2/6D, where d is the diameter of the rearranging entity, and D is the self-diffusion coefficient) is, 
on the other hand, not so clear. It is generally believed, after Adam and Gibbs  48 that many particles 

cooperate in the process and that in this manner the necessity for a molecular sized cavity is avoided. 

Whatever the detailed mechanism may be, it does not seem surprising to the present authors that, near 

the  glass  temperature,  the  energy  fluctuation  involved  should  be  comparable  to  that  needed  for 

diffusion  in  crystals.  After  all,  at  the  glass  temperature,  (a)  the  Arrhenius  slopes  for  processes  at 
constant  volume  and  constant  pressure  have  become  essentially  the  same  38,  49,  and  (b)  the  self-

diffusion  coefficient  is  smaller  than  has  so  far  been  measured  in  any  crystalline  substance  except 
silicon 50. Indeed, the measurement of such a slow diffusion process in solids was only achieved fairly 
recently 51-54.  

    Does the relation between the activation energy at Tg and that at the top of the landscape offer any 

idea of the number of particles (in atomic liquids) or rearrangable sub-units (in complex molecules) 

that  need  to  cooperate  in  an  elementary  relaxation  step  in  liquids  near  Tg?  A  reasonable  estimate 
might be that obtained by dividing the activation energy at Tg by that at TA,  14,49 (near the normal (1 

atm) boiling point) for the case in which the volume remains constant over the whole range. Such data 

are  not  available  for  laboratory  systems.  However,  in  the  case  of  mixed  LJ  the  activation  energy 

obtained  by  the  construction  of  Fig.  6  has  increased  by  nearly  a  factor  of  2  between  TA  (where 
Arrhenius  law  becomes  valid  14)  and  TC,  (the  mode  coupling  critical  temperature  or  crossover 
temperature) 14,37. The number would increase to a value of 5-8 at the temperature extrapolated for a 

structural  relaxation  time  of  100  s,  using  the  VFT  equation  provided  by  ref.  39.  This  is  somewhat 
greater than the value obtained by Takahara et al 55 from application of the Adam Gibbs equation 48, 

but the latter treatment did not take account of the increase in the vibrational heat capacity (over that 
of the glass), that follows from the change of basin shape with level on the landscape 38,39,40. Inclusion 

of  that  effect  in  the  calculation  would  lead  to  a  larger  cooperative  group  at  Tg  than  derived  by 
Takahara et al 55. 

    It may be some time before any agreement is reached on this interesting question, but we note here 

how the construction of Fig. 6 requires that the activation energy at Tg divided by Tg be the same for 

all liquids. The relaxation at the strong liquid limit presumably occurs by a solid-like single particle 

process  -  which  would  then  imply  the  often-cited  idea  that  the  more  fragile  liquids  are  more 

cooperative, i.e. have increasingly large cooperative groups at Tg.

D. Energy landscape considerations 

    These considerations have some bearing on the way one must think about energy landscapes. Since 

the  landscape  has  3N  +  1  dimensions  and  a  number  of  minima  of  the  order  of  exp(N),  there  are 

difficulties in discussing its features directly.  It is easier to think first of the landscape for the crystal. 

Here it is clear that a mechanically stable minimum on the configuration space landscape corresponds 

to a real space lattice containing a specified number of defects. To move up to a higher level on the 

landscape it is necessary to create additional defects. In order to change from one basin to another it is 

evidently  necessary  to  surmount  a  barrier  (the  known  single  particle  diffusion  activation  energy) 

which is higher than any conceivable level of the landscape, and which approaches the lattice energy 

in  magnitude.  "Landscape"  is  perhaps  not  the  most  appropriate  description  of  such  an  energy 

topography: A "forest of spikes" would be more accurate for the common 2D representation (cartoon) 

whereas “rugged honeycomb” might come closer for a 3D representation.  

    The  question  to  be  answered  in  connection  with  liquids is  the  extent  to  which  a  similar  situation 

applies to liquid landscapes under conditions where energies and diffusivities approach those  of  the 

crystal. At high energies, according to simulations, the landscape broadens out to a high plateau and 
the most common "basin of attraction" 21 (above which the system "floats") is of very small depth and 
high anharmonicity 14,55. Each such minimum can be reached from any other without the need to cross 
significant barriers. At lower temperatures significant barriers emerge 56. A question provoked by our 

observations  is  whether  the  liquid  landscape  evoked  by  the  simulations  remains  completely  distinct 

from  the  crystalline  case,  or  whether  indeed  its  fate,  at  low  energies,  is  to  become  a  "forest  of 

spikes"(in 2D) as in the case of the crystal. 

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS 

    By  controlled  annealing  studies  such  as  those  recently  reported  for  a  hyperquenched  mineral 
glass3b,  the  manner  in  which  the  hyperquenched  glass  descends  the  landscape  in  successive  stages, 
depending  on  annealing  temperature,  can  be  examined  4.  Extensions  of  the  present  work  in  this 

direction will be reported in future papers. When a glass has been created suddenly, by increases in 

pressure, a similar annealing series can be seen. Such stages in the relaxation of HDA (high density 
amorphous)  water,  were  recently  reported,  57  but  they  were  interpreted  as  evidence  for  different 

 

 

 

 

 

16 

distinct  polyamorphs  of  water.  Extensions  of  the  present  work  to  include  samples  studied  after 

vitrification at high pressure, may be expected to throw additional light on this interesting question.

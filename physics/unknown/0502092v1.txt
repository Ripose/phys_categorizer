ABSTRACT:  Chiral  tetrahedral  molecules  can  be  dealt  under  the  standard  of  quaternionic  algebra. 

Specifically, non-commutativity of quaternions is a feature directly related to the chirality of molecules. 

It  is  shown  that  a  quaternionic  representation  naturally  comes  out  from  empirical  Fischer  projections 

and  the  action  of  the  related  algebra  on  the  quantum  states  of  molecules  is  studied.  Analogies  with 

fundamental particle physics are discussed. 

Key words: chiral tetrahedral molecules; quaterninonic representation; particle physics 

 

1. Introduction 

The use of analogies often gives deep insight to understand phenomena which appear very different in 

length,  time  and  energy  scales.  For  example,  Heisenberg  [1]  suggested  that  the  analogies  between 

quantum  states  of  chiral  molecules  and  those  of  elementary  particles  have  to  be  seriously  taken  into 

1

account,  in  order  to  develop  a  coherent  quantum  chemistry  capable  of  providing  a  comprehensive 

description of structures and dynamics of molecules. In this perspective, the representations adopted for 

particle quantum mechanics, in particular the group theory, have to work in the framework of quantum 

chemistry, giving account of most of the features of particles. 

Recently,  it  has  been  shown  that  chiral  tetrahedral  molecules  can  be  represented  by  an  orthogonal 

O(4)  algebra,  constructed  starting  from  empirical  Fischer  projections  [2,3].  This  representation  gives 

rise to a chirality index  χ which allows the classification of molecules as achiral, diastereoisomers and 

enantiomers. As a consequence, the chiral features of tetrahedral chains can be predicted by means of a 

sort  of  molecular  Aufbau  [4].  Furthermore,  a  consistent  Schrödinger  equation  has  been  worked  out, 

whose solutions represent the bonds of tetrahedrons and then the O(4) algebra can be considered as a 

“quantum chiral algebra” [5]. 

This approach can be furtherly developed taking into account the quaternionic representation which 

holds  a  prominent  role  in  fundamental  particle  physics.  In  fact,  it  is  well-known  that  Dirac  equation 

proceeds from the Klein-Gordon equation, when written in a quaternionic form [6,7], and Pauli matrices 

satisfy quaternionic algebraic rules [8]. These are the fundamental features of spinor particle physics, so 

that  one  can  wonder  if  they  also  hold  for  chiral  molecules.  Specifically,  the  non-commutativity  of 

quaternionic  algebra  can  be  directly  related  to  chirality  and  parity  of  particles  and  particle  quantum 

states can be represented as quaternionic vectors. 

In this paper, we want to deal with tetrahedral molecules as quaternions, showing that this is a natural 

representation by which chirality is intrinsically recovered. On the other hand, it follows that the O(4) 

chiral algebra is nothing else but a quaternionic representation for non-commutative objects. 

The layout of the paper is the following. In Section 2, the main features of quaternions, as generalized 

complex  numbers  and  vectors,  are  described.  In  particular,  we  deal  with  their  SO(4)  (and  then  O(4)) 

algebraic representation. Section 3 is devoted to the construction of quaternionic representation of chiral 

molecules  starting  from  Fischer  projection  rules.  There  will  be  given  account  of  eigenvalues, 

eigenvectors  and  commutation  rules.  The  action  of  such  a  quantum  algebra  on  the  quantum  states  of 

2

 

molecules  is  discussed  in  Section  4,  pointing  out  how  the  approach  could  be  of  effective  interest  for 

quantum  chemistry.  Discussion  and  conclusions,  in  particular analogies with  elementary particles, are 

reported in Section 5.

quaternions. Let us introduce the bilinear multiplication rules in H:

This  is  an  associative,  non-commutative  algebra  which  can  be  represented  in  matrix  form.  The 

quaternion q can be given as a matrix

which are nothing else but the “Pauli matrices” which satisfy the properties

A particularly useful subset of quaternions is that with unitary norm, usually denoted as H1. In this case,

and then 

the property 

holds. In a 4-dimensional real space R4, with coordinates (a, b, c, d), the set H1 is a hypersurface whose 

equation is

which means that the group H1 is isomorphic to SU(2). 

If  SO(3)  is  the  group  of  rotations  on  the  sphere,  in  standard  3-dimensional  Euclidean  space  R3,  it  is 

straightforward to recover the isomorphism [9]

Another useful representation is given by the isomorphism of the groups

Finally, quaternions can be represented as 4-vectors

Orthogonal  matrices  in  4-dimensions  constitute  the  O(4)  group  which  is  given  by  the  group  of  4-

rotations SO(4) plus the inversions which do not constitute a group since the product of two inversions 

is  again  a  rotation.  As  we  shall  see  in  the  next  section,  this  representation  works  for  tetrahedral 

molecules with central molecular chirality. 

3. Chiral tetrahedral molecules as quaternions 

A chiral tetrahedral molecule can be described as a colum vector (a quaternion)

where the components Ψj represent the bonds connected together by the central atom. Starting from a 

given  configuration,  all  possible  rotations  and  permutations  of  such  bonds  can  be  obtained  by  the 

Fischer  projections  [10],  which  assign  the  planar  representation  of  the  molecule.  The  rules  which  we 

have to follow for this representation can be sketched starting from Fig.1: the atoms pointing sideways 

must  project  forward  in  the  model,  while  those  pointing  up  and  down  in  the  projection  must  extend 

toward the rear. Let us take into account (S)-(+)-lactic acid.

To obtain proper results, projections may not be rotated of 90°, while a 180° rotation is allowed. The 

interchange of any two groups results in the conversion of an enantiomer into its mirror image (Fig.2). 

The chemical groups can be indicated by numbers running from 1 to 4. For the example which we are 

considering:  OH=1,  CO2H=2,  H=3,  CH3=4,  without  taking  into  account  the  effective  priorities  of  the 

groups [10]. There are 24 (=4! the number of permutations of 4 ligands among 4 sites) projections.

Figure 4. Twelve Fischer projections of (R)-(-)-lactic acid. 

The other 12 graphs in Fig. 4 represent the (−) enantiomer. 

The permutations shown in Fig.3 can be obtained, either by permuting groups of three bonds or by 

turning the projections by 180°. The permutations outlined in Fig.4 derive by those in Fig. 3 simply by 

interchanging two groups. 

In order to reduce the Fischer rules to an algebraic structure, we define an operator 

kχ  acting on a 

tetrahedral molecule. Let us take into account a single tetrahedron. The generalization of the following 

results to simply connected chains of tetrahedrons is easily accomplished [4]. 

The Fischer projection corresponding to the column vector (27) is

which is the first in Fig.3. The position of the bonds in the column vector (27) are assigned starting from 

the left and proceeding clockwise in the Fischer projection. 

The  matrix  representation  of  the  projection  (1)  is  assumed  as  the  starting  one  with  respect  to  the 

operators 

kχ , i. e.  χ  is the 4 x 4 identity matrix

It generates the inversion between the bonds 

1Ψ  and

By this approach, all the 24 projections can be obtained (12 for the (+) enantiomer and 12 for the (−) 

enantiomer  represented  in  Figs.3  and  4)  by  matrix operators acting on the fundamental projection  (1). 

The tables in the Appendix summarize the situation. The matrices in Table I and II (see the Appendix) 

are the elements of a 4-parameter algebra. Those in Table I are a representation of rotations, while those 

in Table II are inversions. Both sets constitute the O(4) group of 4× 4 orthogonal matrices. The matrices 

in Table I are a representation of the remarkable subgroup SO(4) of 4× 4 matrices with determinant +1. 

The matrices in Table II have determinant  1− , being inversions (or reflections). They do not constitute 

a group since the product of any two of them has determinant  1+ . This fact means that the product of 

two  inversions  generates  a  rotation  (this  is  obvious  by  inverting  both  the  couples  of  bonds  in  a 

tetrahedron). The total algebra is closed [9] and it represents all possible unitary transformations that a 

quaternion, in 4-vector form, can undergo. 

The 24 matrices in Table I and II in the Appendix are not all independent. They can be grouped as 

different representations of the same operators. In fact all matrices, representing the same operator, have 

the  same  characteristic  polynomial  [9,11].  In  other  words,  the  characteristic  equation  of  a  matrix  is 

invariant under vector base changes. In the (+) enantiomer case, the characteristic eigenvalue equation 

is

where λ is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. 

In the case of the (−) enantiomer, we have

From Eqs. (34) and (35), we recover 6 eigenvalues

with obvious calculations depending on the choice of 

kχ  and 

kχ . Ψ is given by Eq. (27). It is worth 

noting that the number of independent eigenvalues (and then eigenvectors) is related to the number of 

independent elements of each member of a given group O(N). If N2 is the total number of elements and

For  O(4),  it  is  6,  which  is  the  number  of  independent  generators  of  the  group  [9],  giving  the 

“dimension” of the group. With these considerations in mind, it can be stated that Fischer projections 

generates the algebraic structure of tetrahedral molecules and quaternions are a natural representation. 

In  fact,  considering  the  4-vector  (27)  as  a  quaternion,  it  is  clear  that  its  components  can  undergo 

rotations  and  inversions  satisfying  the  fundamental  rules  (2),  (3),  (4)  (in  particular  any  chiral 

transformation  as  (32)).  Any  single  bond  can  be  seen  as  a  complex  number  [3]  and  then  the 

considerations valid for the matrix (5) hold. In this sense, a couple of bonds satisfy the SU(2) algebra, 

while  the  total  tetrahedron  satisfies  the  algebra  (21),  or  O(4).  The  matrices 

kχ   and 

kχ   are  unitary 

quaternionic operators accounting for  all possible transformations preserving the tetrahedral structure. 

As a particular case, if we are considering an achiral tetrahedron, all the transformations preserving its 

structure can be accounted by the SO(4) group, i. e. only rotations without inversions. 

It is worthwhile noting that this approach, in particular Eq. (34), (35) and the eigenvalues (36), can be 

related to the “pseudoscalar measurements” used to get information about the structure (in particular the 

chirality) of molecules in the sense indicated by Ruch [12] and Barron [13]. In fact, a pseudoscalar, in 

particular  its  sign,  can  always  be  related  to  optical  rotation  or  circular  dichroism  allowing  the 

determination  of  the  molecular  chirality.  The  double  sign  of  eigenvalues  (36)  is  an  indication  in  this 

sense, because it clearly points out the fact that a molecule is passing from a state with a given chirality 

to the opposite one. 

 

However, our λs are not the Ruch’s λs. In our case, λ indicates the global chirality state of the molecule, 

in Ruch’s case, it is a parameter describing the ligand. The stereochemical information, in our case, is 
11

relative to both enantiomers and it is not absolute. The transitions between two chiral quantum states of 

the molecules are discuss in the next section. 

4. Quaternionic algebra and quantum states of molecules 

In order to  realize the Heisenberg program, our quaternionic algebra has to account for the transitions 

of quantum states of molecules. In fact, always along the line suggested by Heisenberg, a crucial point 

is that elementary particles are not in stationary states of the hamiltonian and so their quantum states do 

not  belong  to  definite  symmetries.  This  is  also  the  case  for  chiral  molecules,  which  interconvert  (via 

tunnelling) between the left- and right-handed states, which therefore do not have definite parity (since 

parity interconverts the two states). 

In order to study the dynamics of these transitions, we can take into account the set of operators 

kχ , 

kχ  

and 

tot

ˆH ,  where 

kχ , 

kχ   are  the  above  unitary  quaternionic  operators,  which  give  all  the  possible 

transformations preserving the tetrahedral structure, and 

tot

ˆH  is the total Hamiltonian operator for the 

degenerate  isomers  of  an  optically  active  molecule  which  has  to  consists  of  an  even  and  an  odd  part

                                                      (39) 

If this is the case, ignoring eventual parity violation effects [15], energy eigenstates can be obtained as 

superpositions of handed states, that is, by using the Dirac ket notation, 

[14], i.e.

holds. 

is the parity operator whose eigenvalues are p= ±1. The unitary quaternionic operators 

kχ  and 

kχ  act on the  handed states in the superposition (40). In fact, starting from the initial state (27), which 

we will define as the initial configuration, we have

which means that, considering the quaternionic operators in Tables I and II, the operators 

kχ  “rotate” 

the molecule while the operators 

kχ  “ invert” a couple of bonds. Dropping the indexes and considering

This fact means that the 

kχ  operators allow the transition between the 

RΨ -states and the 

LΨ -states 

and viceversa (as a quantum tunnelling process), but the overall parity of the energy state is preserved. 

In  conclusion,  the  unitary  quaternionic  operators 

kχ   and 

kχ ,  accounting  for  the  transformations 

preserving the tetrahedral structure, allow the transitions between the non-stationary chiral states of the 

molecule: specifically the  χ  operators preserve the given handed state only rotating it, the  χ  operators

5. Discussion and conclusions 

In  our  opinion,  the  above  considerations  could  have  a  deep  meaning    in  the  footpath  indicated  by 

Heisenberg  [1].  In  fact,  particles  as  Dirac  spinors  can  be  described  exactly  by  the  same  approach  by 

using unitary quaternion operators which act on quantum states. 

As an example, let us take into account a free particle  Ψ  whose dynamics is described by the Klein-

Gordon equation

in  a  non-covariant  form.  The  covariant  form  of  Dirac equation [8] is immediately recovered applying 

the  operator  ie

( ) 3

  to  Eq.  (55).  The  isomorphism  between  quaternionic  and  spinorial  algebrae, 

through the multiplication rules of Pauli matrices, gives the identification of the particle wavefunction 

Ψ with a Dirac spinor. In other words, spinors and quaternions can be represented by the same groups 

[11] (e.g. SL(2,C) or O(4)) as tetrahedral molecules. 

An  immediate  objection  to  the  approach  which  considers  particles  and  molecules  under  the  same 

standard could be that particles are relativistic objects, while molecules are not, so the analogy could be 

only formal. This is not true since in the limit v << c, the Dirac equation becomes the Pauli equation 

[16] which is nothing else but a Schrödinger equation for spinors where an additional term of magnetic 

dipole has to be consider. In this perspective, dynamics and algebra of tetrahedrons and particles are the 

same and the differences lie only in energy, length and time scales. In other words, quantum mechanics 

of spinor particles and chiral molecules is fundamentally scale invariant. 

As a remark, it is interesting to stress the fact that the chirality of tetrahedrons and spinor particles is 

recovered by quaternionic approach in an abstract 4-space thanks to the intrinsic anticommutativity of 

the algebraic representation as O(4) or SU(2)× SU(2). It is worth noting that the dimensionality of the 

space plays a fundamental role in defining the chirality.  As a final remark, it is worth pointing out that 

Fischer  projections,  used  by  organic  chemists  to  determine  absolute  configurations  of  optically  pure 

molecules or simply to represent them bidimensionally, seem not only an empirical set of rules, but can 

15

 

 

 

constitute  a  fundamental  structure  to  achieve  a  quantum  chiral  algebra,  which  relates  properties  of 

tetrahedral molecules to those of  spinor particles.

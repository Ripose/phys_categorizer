for  semi-filled  shell  atoms 

 
       We  present  the  results  of  calculations  of  outer  shell  non-dipole  angular  anisotropy 
parameters 
(HF)  one-electron 
approximation  and  with  account  of  inter-electron  correlations  in  the  frame  of  the  Spin 
Polarized Random Phase Approximation with Exchange (SP RPAE). We demonstrate for 
the first time that this characteristic of photoionization process is essentially sensitive to the 
fact whether the photoelectron has the same or opposite spin orientation to that of the semi-
filled shell.

       1. Introductory remarks 
       The  non-dipole  parameters  of  the  photoelectron  angular  distribution  are  relatively 
, 
small  quantities,  in  general  smaller  than  the  dipole  parameter  by  the  factor 
1
iv  is the mean speed of the ionized electron and c is the speed of light. However, as 
where 
a  result  of  construction  of  high  intensity  continuous  spectrum  radiation  devices,  namely 
synchrotrons and storage rings, the non-dipole parameters became measurable quantities.  
       These  parameters  are  of  great  interest  including  information  not  only  on  dipole 
transition matrix elements but also on quadrupole ones. Therefore they can demonstrate the 
existence of invisible in the absolute cross-section quadrupole resonances and shed light on 
the behavior of photoelectron scattering phases that corresponds not only to 
 but 
also to 
       The expression for differential in energy cross-section is well known since long ago [1, 
2, 3], as well as the concrete expressions for the dipole parameter 
 [3, 4] and non-
[4, 5] for photoionization of an nl subshell (where ω∗/ 
dipole parameters 
(ωηnl
)
is  the  photon  frequency)  in  the  frame  of  one-electron  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  approximation 
and Random Phase Approximation with  Exchange (RPAE), which takes into account the 
most important part of the inter-electron correlations.  
       Extensive  calculations  of  non-dipole  parameters  were  performed  mainly  for  closed 
shell ions and atoms [6, 7]. Special attention was given to noble gases [8] and negative ions 
[9].  There  exist  several  papers  dedicated  to  the  results  of  non-dipole  parameters 
measurements  (see e.g. [10-12]). However,  almost nothing  was done in this direction for 
open  shell  atoms,  particularly  with  accounting  for  the  role  of  electron  correlations.  The 
latter are especially important in these atoms.  
       The general consideration of open shell atoms in the frame of RPAE is rather complex. 
But it was demonstrated quite a while ago that semi-filled shell atom, being in one sense

open shell atoms can be treated in the RPAE frame as closed shell atoms with two types, 
namely  “up”  and  “down”  electrons,  thus  called  according  to  their  spin  direction.    The 
corresponding generalization of RPAE can be found in [13].  
       
       2. Main formulas 
       In  this  section  we  will  present  the  main  formulae  used  in  this  paper.  Since  they  are 
known,  we  will  limit  ourselves  to  the  final  results  only,  omitting  the  corresponding 
derivations.  The  following  relation  gives  the  differential  in  angle  photoionization  cross-

       In  this  paper  we  investigate  semi-filled  shell  atoms.  As  it  was  demonstrated  in  [13], 
they can be treated as objects that consists of two types of different particles, namely “up” 
and  “down”  electrons,  according  to  their  spin  projection, ↑ and  ↓ ,  with  no  exchange 
between  them.  In  such  case  the  ordinary  HF  approximation  has  to  be  replaced  by  Spin-
Polarized  Hartree-Fock  (SP  HF)  and  RPAE  has  to  be  replaced  by  SP  RPAE.  Most 
conveniently this can be done in the operator, symbolic form.  
       The dipole RPAE equation (11) in the operator form looks like [18]

As a result of the difference of “up” and “down” states, all the subshells become separated 
into  two  levels.  For  semi-filled  atoms  all  these  levels  are  totally  filled  with 
and 
"down
  electrons  [13].  The  corresponding  generalization  of  RPAE  is  easy  to  achieve

       With a single line we denote the semi-filled subshell that acts upon outer s-electrons 
that are emphasized by a double line. In all but Li atoms the angular anisotropy parameters 
(ωγC
 given in HF by (15), where RPAE corrections are including using substitution (16), 
)
are dependent upon the final state ion term. This term corresponds to a spin that is smaller 
by 1/2 than the spin of the initial, if an “up” electron is eliminated, and bigger by 1/2, if a 
“down” electron is eliminated.   
       In these notations “down” means final state term for s-electrons photoionization for P - 
5S , Cr* - 
5S , Eu 
9S , while “up” means for P - 
7S .  Note  that  for  Cr  and  Cr*  the  final  state  term  after  outer  s-electron  photoionization 
- 
remains, naturally, the same. 
       The Figure for Li 

s1γ  shows no influence of the final state term. On the contrary, the 
s2γ   leading  to  a  prominent  maximum  at  about  50  eV.  The 
situation  in  P  is  completely  different: 
s↓3γ   are  essentially  different,  particularly 
close to respective rather different thresholds. In both of them the effect of 3p-electrons are 
quite  impressive.  As  to 
p↑3δ   being  by  a 
p↑3δ  are 

p↑3γ ,  it  has  a  strong  maximum  at  31  eV,  while 
p↑3γ , has at 32 eV a deep minimum. Note that  C

factor of ten smaller than  C

onset  of  1s  threshold  affects 

p↑3γ  and 

s↑3γ   and

s↓6γ   and 

s↑6γ   is  very  big  within  10  eV  region  near 

almost not affected by electron correlations. 
       In Cr the difference between 
s↓4γ  are big and impressive, particularly close 
s↑4γ  and 
to  thresholds  that  are  almost  the  same  for  “up”  and  “down”  cases.  The  role  of  electron 
correlations  C
d ↑3γ  is negligible.  As it is seen from respective Figures, the situation is almost 
the same in Mn. 
       In  Eu  the  difference  between 
threshold. At higher energies they are close to each other and very small. 
       Entirely,  we  detect  a  strong  dependence  of  the  non-dipole  angular  anisotropy 
parameters for outer s-electrons in semi-filled shell atoms upon the tern of the residual ion.

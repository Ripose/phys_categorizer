ABSTRACT 

 
Silicon and germanium are perhaps the two most well-understood semiconductor materials in the context of solid state 
device  technologies  and  more  recently  micromachining  and  nanotechnology.    Meanwhile,  these  two  materials  are also 
important  in  the field of infrared lens design.  Optical instruments designed for the wavelength range where these two 
materials are transmissive achieve best performance when cooled to cryogenic temperatures to enhance signal from the 
scene over instrument background radiation.  In order to enable high quality lens designs using silicon and germanium at 
cryogenic temperatures, we have measured the absolute refractive index of multiple prisms of these two materials using 
the Cryogenic, High-Accuracy Refraction Measuring System (CHARMS) at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, as a 
function  of  both  wavelength  and  temperature.    For  silicon,  we  report  absolute  refractive  index  and  thermo-optic 
coefficient (dn/dT) at temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 K at wavelengths from 1.1 to 5.6  (cid:0) m, while for germanium, 
we cover temperatures ranging from 20 to 300 K and wavelengths from 1.9 to 5.5  (cid:0) m.  We compare our measurements 
with  others  in  the  literature  and  provide  temperature-dependent  Sellmeier  coefficients  based  on  our  data  to  allow 
accurate  interpolation  of  index  to  other  wavelengths  and  temperatures.    Citing  the  wide  variety  of  values  for  the 
refractive indices of these two materials found in the literature, we reiterate the importance of measuring the refractive 
index  of  a  sample  from  the  same  batch  of  raw  material  from  which  final  optical  components  are  cut  when  absolute 
accuracy greater than ±5 x 10-3 is desired.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

 
Historically,  few  accurate  refractive  index  measurements  of  infrared  materials  have  been  made  at  cryogenic 
temperatures.    This  has  hampered  the  developments  of  many  cryogenic  infrared  instruments,  including  the  Infrared 
Array  Camera  (IRAC)  for  NASA’s  Spitzer  Space  Telescope,  for  which,  for  design  purposes,  index  values  for  its  lens 
materials  were  extrapolated  from  literature  values  both  in  wavelength  and  in  temperature.    Such  an  approach  leads  to 
integration cycles which are far longer than anticipated, where best instrument performance is achieved by trial and error 
in many time-consuming and expensive iterations of instrument optical alignment.   
 
The Cryogenic High Accuracy Refraction Measuring System (CHARMS) has been recently developed at GSFC to make 
such measurements in the absolute sense (in vacuum) down to temperatures as low as 15 K with unsurpassed accuracy 
using the method of minimum deviation refractometry.1,2,3  For low index materials with only modest dispersion such as 
synthetic fused silica, CHARMS can measure absolute index with an uncertainty in the sixth decimal place of index.  For 
materials  with  higher  indices  and  high  dispersion  such  as  Si  or  Ge,  CHARMS  can  measure  absolute  index  with  an 
uncertainty  of  about  one  part  in  the  fourth  decimal  place  of  index.    Measurement  and  calibration  methods  used  and 
recent facility improvements are discussed in previous papers.4,5 

 
Prism pairs were purchased for this study of silicon and germanium by the James Webb Space Telescope’s Near-Infrared 
Camera (JWST/NIRCam) and were fabricated from one boule of each respective material.  Therefore, this study is not 
primarily  an  interspecimen  variability  study  for  specimens  from  different  material  suppliers  or  from  different  lots  of 
material from a given supplier.  Both silicon prisms were specified as “optical grade” silicon and both germanium prisms 
were specified as single-crystal germanium at the time of fabrication.  The purity level for all four prisms is specified at 
>99.999%  by  the  material  vendor.    Once  again,  no  quantitative  analysis  of  the  relationship  between  crystal  type  or

material  purity  and  refractive  index  has  been  done  during  this  study.    The  examination  of  such  variability  is  being 
considered for future efforts.   
 
The apex angle of the prism for each material is designed so that the beam deviation angle for the highest index in the 
material’s transparent range will equal the largest accessible deviation angle of the refractometer, 60°.  Common prism 
dimensions are refracting face length and height of 38.1 mm and 28.6 mm, respectively.    Nominal apex angles for the 
prisms measured in this study are: Si – 20.0° and Ge – 17.0°. 
 

2.  PRESENTATION OF MEASURED INDEX DATA 

 
Detailed descriptions of our data acquisition and reduction processes are documented elsewhere4, as are our calibration 
procedures5.  In general we fit our raw measured data to a temperature dependent Sellmeier model of the form:

)T(

where Si are the strengths of the resonance features in the material at wavelengths l
i  . When dealing with a wavelength 
interval between wavelengths of physical resonances in the material, the summation may be approximated by only a few 
terms, m – typically three.6  In such an approximation, resonance strengths Si and wavelengths l
i no longer have direct 
physical  significance  but  are  rather  parameters  used  to  generate  an  adequately  accurate  fit  to  empirical  data.    If  these 
parameters are assumed to be functions of T, one can generate a temperature-dependent Sellmeier model for n(l
 
Historically,  this  modeling  approach  has  been  employed  with  significant  success  for  a  variety  of  materials  despite  a 
rather serious sparsity of available index measurements – to cover a wide range of temperatures and wavelengths – upon 
which  to  base  a  model.      One  solution  to the shortcoming of lack of measured index data has been to appeal to room 
temperature  refractive  index  data  at  several  wavelengths  to  anchor  the  model  and  then  to  extrapolate  index  values  for 
other temperatures using accurate measurements of the thermo-optic coefficient dn/dT at those temperatures, which are 
much  easier  to  make  than  accurate  measurements  of  the  index  itself  at  exotic  temperatures.6    This  is  of  course  a 
potentially dangerous assumption, depending on the sample material in question and the required accuracy of refractive 
index knowledge. 
 
Meanwhile,  with  CHARMS,  we  have  made  direct  measurements  of  index  densely  sampled  over  a  wide  range  of 
wavelengths  and  temperatures  to  produce  a  model  with  residuals  on  the  order  of  the  uncertainties  in  our  raw  index 
measurements.  For our models, we have found that 4th order temperature dependences in all three terms in each of Si 
and l

i work adequately well, as also found previously in the literature.6  The Sellmeier equation consequently becomes: 

,T).

These Sellmeier models are our best statistical representation of the measured data over the complete measured ranges of 
wavelength  and  temperature.    All  of  the  tabulated  values  for  the  refractive  index  of  Si  and  Ge  below  have  been

calculated using this Sellmeier model based on our measured data using the appropriate coefficients in Tables 5 and 10.  
Depending on the sample material measured, the residuals of the measured values compared to the fits can be as low as 
several parts in the sixth decimal place of index.  This level of fit quality for data obtained using CHARMS generally 
pertains  to  low  index  materials  with  moderately  low  dispersion  such  as  fused  silica,  LiF,  and  BaF2.    For  high  index 
materials such as Si and Ge, residuals are higher and in the range of 1 x 10-4 to 1 x 10-5 depending on the wavelength and 
temperature of interest.

2.1  Silicon 
Absolute refractive indices of Si were measured over the 1.1 to 5.6 microns wavelength range and over the temperature 
range  from  20  to  300  K  for  two  test  specimens  which  yielded  equal  indices  to  within  our  typical  measurement 
uncertainty of +/- 1 x 10-4 (see Table 1).  Indices are plotted in Figure 1, tabulated in Table 2 for selected temperatures 
and wavelengths.  Spectral dispersion is plotted in Figure 2, tabulated in Table 3.  Thermo-optic coefficient is plotted in 
Figure 3, tabulated in Table 4.  Coefficients for the three term Sellmeier model with 4th order temperature dependence 
are given in Table 5.

2.2  Germanium 
Absolute  refractive  indices  of  Ge  were  measured  over  the  1.9  to  5.5  microns  wavelength  range  and  over  a  range  of 
temperatures  from  20  to  300  K  for  two  test  specimens  which,  as  with  Si,  yielded  equal  indices  to  within  our  typical 
measurement uncertainty of +/-1 x 10-4 (see Table 6).  Indices are plotted in Figure 4, tabulated in Table 7 for selected 
temperatures and wavelengths.  Spectral dispersion is plotted in Figure 5, tabulated in Table 8.  Thermo-optic coefficient 
is plotted in Figure 6, tabulated in Table 9.  Coefficients for the three term Sellmeier model with 4th order temperature 
dependence are given in Table 10.

3.  COMPARISON WITH LITERATURE VALUES 

 

 
There have been many efforts in the past to measure the refractive indices of silicon7,8,9,10,11,12 and germanium7,10,12,13,14.  
Comparisons  between  the  present  work  and  these  literature  values  can  be  found  in  Figures  7  and  8.    The  references 
mentioned above are by no means an exhaustive compilation, but rather serve to provide a sample of the measurement 
values  published  using  prismatic  measurement  techniques  (i.e.  minimum  deviation  method,  modified  minimum 
deviation method, etc.).  Most investigators list uncertainties in their respective measurements somewhere in the range of 
±1 x 10-3 to ±1 x 10-4, the present work included (see Tables 1 and 6).  As other researchers have concluded, even though

the  range  of  measured  values  in  the  literature  is  greater  than  the  listed  uncertainties  amongst  the  various  authors,  we 
believe  our  measurements  are  accurate  to  the  level  stated  in  the  above  tables.    The  differences  between  the  reported 
values  may  in  fact  be  real  if  there  are  significant  interspecimen  differences  in  refractive  index  due  to  sample  material 
purity or other factors.  Unfortunately a quantitative measure of these differences in physical properties of the measured 
samples has not been done, nor have different researchers measured the same sample prisms as far as we can tell.  This 
conclusion only reinforces the philosophy that  ─
 a 
sample  prism  from  the  same  batch  of  material  as  the  final  optical  components  should  be  fabricated  and  measured  to 
insure to appropriate index of refraction values are used.

4.  CONCLUSION 

 
Using  CHARMS,  we  have  directly  measured  the  absolute  refractive  indices  of  the  infrared  materials  silicon  and 
germanium, from their near-infrared cutoff to 5.6(cid:1) m, and from room temperature down to as low as 20 K.  Their spectral 
dispersion  and  thermo-optic  coefficient  were  also  examined  and  temperature  dependent  Sellmeier  models  were 
generated  based  on  the  measured  refractive  index  data  with  residuals  on  the  order  of  the  uncertainty  in  the  respective 
measurements.    While  our  measurement  uncertainty  was  smaller  than  discrepancies  with  other  published  values  in  the 
literature,  we  believe  the  differences  can  be  at  least  partially  attributed  to  interspecimen  variability  and  variations  in 
specimen  purity.    The  conclusion  has  been  drawn  that  for  applications  requiring  accurate  knowledge  of  the  refractive 
index  of  their  optical  components,  the  measurement  of  a  prism  cut  from  the  same  batch  of  material  as  those  optical 
components should be part of the optical design process.

The macro-to-micro transition in a heterogeneous material is envisaged as the selection of a probability distribution by the 
Principle  of  Maximum  Entropy  (MAXENT).  The  material  is  made  of  constituents,  e.g.  given  crystal  orientations.  Each 
constituent is itself made of a large number of elementary constituents. The relevant probability is the volume fraction of the 
elementary constituents that belong to a given constituent and undergo a given stimulus. Assuming only obvious constraints 
in MAXENT means describing a maximally disordered material. This is proved to have the same average stimulus in each 
constituent. By adding a constraint in MAXENT, a new model, potentially interesting e.g. for texture prediction, is obtained.

MAXENT  gives  a  link  between  information  theory  and  statistical  mechanics  [1].  According  to  information  theory,  the 
“amount of uncertainty ” represented by a probability distribution (pi)i = 1, ..., M  on a finite set E = {x1, ..., xM} is the statistical 
entropy given by 

The principle of maximum statistical entropy (MAXENT) 

S = − 

pi Log pi. 

 

 

 

 

 

          

 

         (1) 

MAXENT applies to the case where only some expectation values 

 〈φq〉 ≡ 

pi φq(xi) = aq 

(q = 1, ..., Q) 

 

    

 

 

 

          (2) 

are  known  (with φq  known  functions  and  Q  <<  M).  In  a  such  case,  it  is  clear  that  the  distribution  (pi)  i  =  1,  ...,  M    is  not 
determined by the data aq  (q = 1, ..., Q). MAXENT says that the relevant distribution (pi) makes S a maximum with the Q 
constraints  (2).  This  amounts  to  selecting  the  broadest  probability  distribution  compatible  with  the  available  information. 
Statistical  mechanics,  on  the  other  hand,  considers  a  system  made  of  a  huge  number  N  of  “elementary  constituents”,  e.g. 
molecules  (in  the  kinetic  theory  of  gases).  The  micro-state  (velocity  and  position)  of  each  molecule  is  in  one  among  M 
possible boxes, with 1 << M << N. Let li (i = 1, ..., M ) be the number of molecules  in box (i). The corresponding fraction is  
pi = li /N  (thus pi  ≥ 0 and p1 + ... + pM  = 1, as required for a probability distribution). The macro-state is a set of relevant 
macroscopic  parameters:  pressure,  density,  temperature,  ...  Each  parameter  making  the  macro-state  should  be  computable 
from the probability distribution (pi), as the average (expectation) 〈φ 〉 of some known function φ. Now a given probability 
distribution (pi) is obtainable by a large number of distinct configurations [a configuration is the mapping: molecule → box 
(i)]. The hypothese made in statistical mechanics is that the “real ” distribution is the one that may be obtained by the largest 
number of distinct configurations. Since the possible configurations must be compatible with the given macro-state, the most 
general  version  of  this  hypothese  is  MAXENT  [1-2].  Indeed  MAXENT  has  become  the  most  fundamental  principle  in 
statistical physics [2].

Consider a heterogeneous medium, e.g. a polycrystal, with two microscopic fields: stimulus and response, e.g. strain-rate d 
and stress σ. (In a porous medium, these would be replaced by the pressure gradient and the filtration velocity. It would be 
easy  to  give  many more examples.) The ideal goal of the  macro-to-micro transition is to determine the micro-fields d(x), 
σ(x) from the mere data of the macro-stimulus, say D. This seems to be an unattainable goal, the more so if the microscopic 
constitutive  relation  is  non-linear  [3].  In  order  that  the  macro-to-micro  transition  in  the  polycrystal  (for  example)  may  fit 
with the MAXENT procedure, the first step is to define the micro-state in the heterogeneous medium. This we define as the 
joint data of the microscopic stimulus [thus here the value of d(x)] and the local state X(x) in the heterogeneous medium [3], 
with X(x) being the set of the internal and/or geometrical variables that make the microscopic constitutive law depend on the 
micro  position  x  [4].  For  a  polycrystal,  the  heterogeneity  is  mainly  due  to  the  anisotropy  of  the  constitutive  crystals.  The 
microscopic constitutive law d(x) – σ(x) is hence often considered to be known from the mere data of the local orientation 
R(x), which means that X(x) = R(x). We shall use this assumption to fix the ideas in the following, but it is by no means 

Implementation of MAXENT in physics of heterogeneous media 

necessary to the general method discussed. Thus in a deformed polycrystal, the micro-state is (d(x), R(x)). The second step 
is to discretize the possible values of the micro-state. First, we assume a discrete orientation distribution: 

at time t, R(x, t)∈{R1(t), ..., Rn(t)}.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

         (3) 

 
[Note  that,  in  an  ideal  polycrystal,  the  crystal  orientations  would  have  a  priori  a  discrete  distribution:  in  that  case,  the 
discretization of R(x, t) would be trivial. Many procedures exist to discretize the orientation distribution in a real polycrystal, 
i.e., to approximate the real orientation field by a piecewise constant field satisfying (3).] The volume fractions fk  (k = 1, ..., 
n) of the different orientations are given, with f1 + ... + fn  = 1. The current texture may be characterized by the data of (f1, 
R1(t)), ..., (fn, Rn(t)). Due to the incompressibility of plastic deformation, the fractions fk may be assumed constant. Yet the 
texture evolves due to the evolution of the orientations, i.e., due to the dependence Rk  = Rk (t). 
   
An attainable aim for the macro-to-micro transition (e.g. in a polycrystal), is to calculate the list (Dk)k = 1, ..., n  with 
 
Dk = Dk(t) the average strain-rate in the orientation Rk(t). Thus Dk (t) is the average of the micro-field d(x, t) over the zone 
Zk of the polycrystal where the crystal orientation is Rk(t). Then, using the constitutive law for this orientation, the (average) 
stress σk(t) is obtained. The (average) rotation rates Ωk(t) =  &R k Rk(t)−1 are also obtained, hence an evolution (averaged over 
each orientation) is got. But, in order to use MAXENT so as to calculate the distribution (Dk (t)), we still have to discretize 
the  possible  values  taken  by  the  strain-rate  d(x,  t).  In  the  following,  we  consider  a  fixed  time  t,  hence  we  omit  the 
dependence with t henceforth. Using a (hyper)cubic mesh with a small size ε for the strain-rate, the discretization is defined 
by the nodes of the mesh, say D1, ..., D m. We substitute for d(x) the following piecewise constant field: 
 

d’(x) = (d’1 (x), ..., d’6 (x)) with d’l  (x) = ε Int (dl  (x)/ε) 

[(Int(ξ) = k)  ⇔  (k integer and  k ≤ ξ < k +1)]      (4) 

 
where T1 , ..., T6  are the independent components of a second-order symmetric tensor T. Thus, the domains 
 

Ωj  ≡ {x ; d’(x) = D j } (j = 1, ..., m)  

 

 

          

        (5) 

 
are well-defined, two by two disjoined, and their union covers the whole polycrystal. The same is true for the Zk ‘s. We have  
 

||d(x) − D j ||∞ = ||d(x) − d’(x) ||∞ ≤ ε   for x∈ Ωj .  

 

 

         (6) 

 
Here ||T ||∞ ≡ max (|T1 |, ..., |T6 |) for a second-order symmetric tensor T. The relevant probability distribution is defined as 
 

p j

k  = volume fraction of Ωj ∩ Zk  in the polycrystal = V(Ωj ∩ Zk ) / V(Ω ). 

 

                      (7) 

 
k  is the probability of the joint event d’(x) = D j  and R(x) = Rk , the probability being defined as the volume fraction. 
Thus p j
[I.e., P(A) ≡ V(A)/V(Ω), Ω being the considered representative volume element (RVE) of the polycrystal. Strictly speaking, 
the notion of RVE is an asymptotic one [4-5], but a simpler illustration is got if exactly representative volume elements like 
Ω  are  assumed  to  exist.]  The  domains  ωjk  =  Ωj  ∩ Zk  are  the  elementary  constituents.  They  depend  on  the  discretization 
imposed to the strain-rate field, i.e., they depend on the small parameter ε. Hence the micro-state (d’, R) belongs to the finite 
product set {D1, ..., D m}×{R1, ..., Rn}, so i has become (j, k) and M = m × n in eq. (1). The volume average of the strain-rate 
d’ in orientation Rk  is given (cf. Bayes’ conditional probability formula) by 
 

Dk   = (p1 

k D 1 + ... + p m

k D m)/fk . 

 

 
Now we want to use MAXENT to determine the discrete probability distribution (p j
 
i) The volume fraction of polycrystal in the orientation Rk  is the data fk = V(Zk ) / V(Ω ). Since the domains Ωj   are  
two by two disjoined, and since their union covers the whole polycrystal (or the RVE  Ω), we get from (7):

Hence we may define a model based on MAXENT as follows:

Since the statistical entropy S is a measure of disorder, the latter MAXENT model with obvious constraints  may be called 
the “volume-fraction model with maximum disorder ” [the disorder is that of the strain-rate distribution (p j
k )]. It is often said 
that the self-consistent models describe a situation with perfect disorder  (this is the ideal situation where spatial correlations 
of a finite range do not exist). Indeed there are arguments showing that the classical self-consistent model for linear elasticity 
may correspond to that ideal situation [6]. Taking words naively, one might then wonder if the volume-fraction model with 
maximum disorder is something like a self-consistent model. We prove below that it is not the case. 
 
 
3 
 
I.e., this model (eq. (11)) leads to the following prediction for the average strain-rate Dk  in orientation Rk , defined by (8):  
 

The volume-fraction model with maximum disorder  is “the Voigt-Taylor model plus random fluctuations ” 

Dk  = D  for all k = 1, ..., n.

 by eqs. (8) and (10), it follows that  Dk = D  for all k. Q.E.D.. 

Thus,  model  (a)  is  analogous  to  the  Voigt-Taylor  model  in  the  sense  of  eq.  (12),  though  it  also  describes  some 

 
random fluctuation, in each constituent, of the stimulus field d around the macroscopic stimulus D.

A more interesting MAXENT model (one more constraint) 

 

 

 

 

 

Equation  (12)  is  unrealistic.  To  obtain  a  better  model,  we  must  add  information,  i.e.  add  constraints  in  MAXENT.  One 
possible new constraint is to impose that the average potential is known (assuming therefore that the micro-law expressing 
σ(x) as a function of d(x) does derive from a potential, say uk  in the orientation Rk ) [3] : 

〈u〉 ≡

       (17) 

 
This is the minimum information to add in order to determine the macroscopic behavior since, in the most favourable case, 
the average potential is indeed a potential for the macro-law [5, 7]. Yet it means the micro-to-macro transition is solved! In a 
previously  studied  “inhomogeneous  variational  model”  (IVM),  the  data  U(D)  may  be  replaced  by  the  data of the average 
heterogeneity h, with (for some real exponent p ≥ 1, depending on the behavior of the uk  potentials at large d [4-5])

It has been shown in Ref. [3] that the macro-to-micro transition, i.e., determining the distribution (Dk)k = 1, ..., n from data D 
(plus  necessary  additional  data:  either  h  or  U(D),  in  the  present  case),  is  very  close  in  that  model  and  in  the  above 
MAXENT model based on constraints (9), (10) and (17). But it is simpler to impose directly the average heterogeneity h, 
because it is computable from the unknown (pj
 

k) of the MAXENT procedure.Indeed, using eq. (8), one finds easily that

Thus we propose a new model, that consists in adding the constraint h = r (with r a given number) in model (a) defined by 
eq. (11). This new model does not need that the micro-law derives from a potential. Actually, in this purely statistical model, 
the micro-law itself influences the strain distribution very indirectly – through the value r of the actual heterogeneity, which 
in reality does indeed depend on the micro-law (and on the geometry), but which is considered, in the new model, as the 
relevant information (in addition to the volume fractions). Note that the actual heterogeneity r is measurable. But, to make 
use of the new model, r should rather be phenomenologically assumed, as is also done in the IVM [4]. To study rotation 
effects, one may think to substitute the velocity gradient l (with 9 independent components) for d [8]. 
 

Conclusions 

5 
 
i) A general formulation of the Maximum Entropy Principle (MAXENT) has been given for the macro-to-micro transition 
in a heterogeneous medium. This formulation was illustrated for a textured polycrystal with inelastic deformation. 
 
ii) MAXENT demands constraints. The most obvious ones (the volume fractions are imposed, and the macro-average of 
the  micro-stimulus  is  the  macro-stimulus)  lead  to  predict  the  same  average  stimulus  in  each  constituent  (as  in  Voigt's 
model). 
 
iii) Imposing the value of the average potential gives [3] a model close to the inhomogeneous variational model [4-5]. But 
the new model proposed consists in imposing directly the average heterogeneity as an additional constraint in MAXENT.  
 
iv) MAXENT provides a general method to build more and more accurate models by adding information (i.e. constraints).

Abstract:    The  Lorentz  Transformations  are  derived  without  any 
linearity assumptions and without assuming that y and z coordinates 
transform in a Galilean manner. Status of the invariance of the speed 
of  light  was  reduced  from  a  foundation  of  the  Special  Theory  of 
Relativity to just a property which allows to determine a value of the 
physical  constant.  While  high  level  of  rigour  is  maintained,  this 
paper  should  be  accessible  to  a  second  year  university  physics 
student.

I. Introduction 
Over the last century a great number of derivations of 
in 
the  Lorentz 
textbooks,  monographs  and  scientific  journals.  Apart 
from a few  notable exceptions [1,2] all of them assume 
linearity of the transformation functions. Of those who 
do  prove/discuss  linearity,  practically  all  assume  that 
y   and  z   coordinates  (In  standard  configuration  of 
coordinate  systems)  transform  in  a  Galilean  manner: 
i.e. 
 
In  this  paper  I  have  attempted  to  derive  the  Lorentz 
transformations  without  making  above  mentioned 
assumptions.  Status  of  the  invariance  of  the  speed  of 
light  was  reduced  from  a  foundation  of  the  Special 
Theory of Relativity to just a property which allows to 
determine a value of the physical constant [3]. 
 
In  this  derivation  I  mainly  used  symmetry  arguments 
and  elementary  algebra.  In  section  on  linearity partial 
derivatives theory is used.

II. Definitions and Assumptions 
Inertial  coordinate  system  is  defined  as  a  coordinate 
system (CS) in which: 

a.  Euclidean geometry applies 
b.  Newton’s first law holds 

This definition immediately excludes the possibility of 
two  coordinate  systems  whose  origins  accelerate 
relative to each other being inertial, as particle resting 
at the origin of one system will appear to accelerate in 
another. 
 
The following assumptions are used: 
1. 
Laws  of  physics  are  the  same  in  all  inertial   
coordinate  systems.  (Einstein’s  relativity  principle) 
This  implies  isotropy  of  space  and  homogeneity  of 
space and time. 
2. 
Standard units of length and time are used in 
all inertial systems. (Relativity principle can be used to 
calibrate  units  of  length  and  time  in  each  inertial 
system) 
3. 
All  stationery  observers  equipped  with 
standard  clocks  and  located  in  the  same  inertial 
coordinate system will agree on temporal separation of 
events.  
4. 
Transformation functions are differentiable at 
least  twice  with  respect  to  coordinates  and  are 
continuous  functions  of  the  relative  speed  of  the 
coordinate systems. 

5. 
Any event that is “seen” in one inertial system 
is “seen” in all others. For example if observer in one 
system “sees” an explosion on a rocket then so do all 
other observers. 
6. 
If  (inertial)  observer  A  “sees”  that  (inertial) 
observer  B  is  moving  radially  away  from  him  with 
speed  u,  then  observer  B  “sees”  observer  A  moving 
radially away from him with the same speed u. It might 
seem to the reader that this assumption can be derived 
from  some  symmetry  arguments,  however  to  apply 
symmetry  arguments  we  would  need  to  assume  a 
theoretical  possibility  of  existence  of  a  third  observer 
C, relative to which A and B are symmetrical. 
 
Given  one  inertial  coordinate  system  we  can  set-up 
second coordinate system whose origin A is at rest and 
axis are fixed (rather then rotating) as seen in first. As 
rules  of  Euclidean  geometry  apply  in  the  first  system 
they  also  apply  in  the  second.  Validity  of  Euclidean 
geometry implies that spatial separation of events is the 
same  in  both  systems.  By  assumption  (3)  temporal 
separation also has to be the same, as observer located 
at the origin of second system is at rest relative to the 
first.  Therefore  in  all  inertial  coordinate  systems, 
whose origins are mutually at rest and axis are fixed, 
space-temporal  separation  of  the  events  will  be  the 
same.  Such  systems  are  said  to  belong  to  the  same 
frame  and  space-temporal separation of the events are 
property  of  the  frame  rather  then  of  a  particular 
coordinate  system  in  it  Any  experiment  can  be 
described by referring to a particular frame but without 
a specific coordinate system in it. However to assign a 
particular  values  to  coordinates  we  need  a  coordinate 
system. 
 
Also it is clear that transformation functions must lead 
to one-to-one transformations otherwise single particle 
in  one  frame  could  appear  as  several  (or  have 
undetermined 
another.  Hence 
transformation functions have an inverse.

III. Proof of linearity of coordinate 
transformations 
Part I 
Consider particle P moving with a constant velocity  v 
in an inertial coordinate system K. Let r be its position 
vector in K. Suppose every small time interval  D
t , as 
measured in a rest frame of a particle, it flashes. Let D t 
be  time  interval  between  flashes  as  measured  in  K. 
Interval  D
t . (There 
t could be a function of r,  v and  D
are  no  other  known  parameters  on  which  it  could 
depend.) 
However as observers of all coordinate systems of the 
same  inertial  frame  agree  on  temporal  separation  of 

=

t.)    Hence    D

t  is  directly  proportional  to  D

events  it  follows  that  D
t  could  only  be  a  function  of 
speed  of  P  and  D
t   .  Otherwise  we  could  set-up 
coordinate system K¢  in the same frame as K and with 
axes  parallel  to  corresponding  axes  of  K  but  with  a 
different origin and they would not agree on temporal 
separation of events (flashes); or we could set-up K¢  in 
such a way that origins of both systems would coincide 
but  with  axes  of  K¢   not-parallel  to  axis  of  K,  and 
temporal  separation  of  events  would  be  different  in 
these two systems. 
 
It  is  clear  that    D
t . (For 
example  if  we  decide  to  measure  time  separation  of 
every other flash, effectively doubling  D t  we will also 
double  D
t . As transformation 
t  =    ƒ(n)  D
functions are one-to-one ƒ(v) is finite and is not equal 
to  zero.  By  making  Dt   infinitesimally  small  dt  = 
ƒ(n)dt and dt/dt =ƒ(v).

Hence

where  =i
0, 1, 2, 3. As P moves with constant velocity 
dxi  /dt  and  ƒ(n)  are  constant,  and  hence  dxi  /dt  is 
constant. 
 
Therefore  for  any  particle  moving  with  a  constant 
velocity  in  an  inertial  frame  dxi  /dt    are  constant  and 
d2xi /dt 2 are equal to zero , where dxi are separations of 
two  events  occurring  on  that  particle  as  seen  in  the 
inertial frame and  dt   is proper time interval between 
them. 
 
Part II 
Consider  inertial  coordinate  system  K  and  inertial 
coordinate  system  K¢   whose  origin  is  moving  with 
velocity u relative to K. Suppose particle P moves with 
constant velocity v  in K. Then it moves with constant 
velocity, say  v¢¢,  in  K¢   .  Using  results  from  Part  I  for

IV. Configuration of Coordinate Systems 
the  most  general 
Rather 
transformations  between 
inertial  coordinate 
systems  we  will  consider  a  special  case.  However  as 
transformations  between  coordinate  systems  of  the 
same frame is the same as in classical kinematics, it is 
straightforward  to  derive  most  general transformations 
from the special. 
 
Suppose we have an inertial coordinate systems K. Let 
origin  of  inertial  coordinate  system  K¢   move  with 
speed u along the positive direction of ox axis as seen 
in K. Choose ox¢  of K¢  in such a way that in K¢  (in K¢   
means  as  seen  by  observer  in  K¢ )  origin  of  K  moves 
along  the  negative  direction  of  x¢  axis. Set  t and  t¢  in 
such  a  way  that  t=t¢=0  when  origins  of  K  and  K¢  
coincide. 
 
We did not yet completely define mutual configuration 
of K and K¢  as we did not specify mutual orientation of 
y and y¢.  Choice of orientation of one of these axes is 
arbitrary,  however  orientation  of  one  of  them  defines 
orientation of another. I will return to this point later in 
this part of the paper. 
 
All  constants  (bi  and  bi¢  )  in  the  transformation 
functions must be equal to zero otherwise origins will 
not coincide when t= 0 or t¢=0. 
 
Coordinates  z  and  y  can  not  depend  on  t¢  and 
coordinates  z¢   and  y¢ can not depend on t. Otherwise 
origin  of  one  system  would  have  a  component  of 
velocity perpendicular to ox axis of another. 
 
Consider two events on y axis of K: one at 

1=y

 and 

1-=y

another at 
. If they are simultaneous in K then 
they  are  also  simultaneous  in  K¢   and  have  their  x¢ 
coordinates  are  equal.  Otherwise  their  temporal  order 
or their   x¢ coordinates would be changed by reversal 
of  y  axis  (of  K).  As  choice  of   x¢    axis  in  K¢   is  not 
affected  by  orientation  of  y  axis,  this  is  not  allowed. 
Hence:  coordinates  x¢  and  t¢  do  not  depend  on  y. 
Similarly: coordinates  x¢  and  t¢   do not depend on  z   
and  coordinates  x  and  t  do not depend on  y¢  and  z¢. 
 
Consider an event on the x axis of K. As direction of  y¢  
is arbitrary and is not determined by direction of x axis 
it follows that the event can not have a non-zero  y¢  or

z¢  component  Hence  y¢  and  z¢  do not depend on  x.  
Similarly,  y and  z  do not depend on x¢. 
 
At this stage we have to define mutual configuration of 
K and K¢  by specifying mutual orientation of   y¢  and  
y.  We have shown that y¢ and   z¢  do not depend on x 
and y, and hence transformation functions are:

,  z  is also equal to zero.  Hence we can 
which 
choose a direction of either of  y¢ and y and then chose 
a direction of another in such a way that z¢  (or z) is not 
a function of  y  (or y¢ ). 
 
 
Consider two events for which: x coordinates are equal, 
t coordinates are equal, and one of them lies on x axis. 
Then as  x¢ and  t¢ are not functions of  y and  z, their x¢ 
coordinates are equal and their t¢ coordinates are equal.

the transformations.                                                                                                                                                         
 
Transformation  functions from K¢   to  K¢
¢  are the same 
as  transformation  functions  from  K  to  K¢   with  u=v. 
¢ = z¢ = z. Therefore 
¢ = y¢ = y and z¢
Hence for any event y¢

of K¢
 
By  construction,  origins  of  K  and  K¢   coincide  when 
t=t¢=0  and  origins  of  K¢   and  K¢
  coincide  when 
t¢=t¢¢=0.  Hence  when  t=t¢¢=0  origins  of  K  and  K¢
 
coincide. 
 
¢   moves  along  a  positive 
Finally,  in  K  origin  of  K¢
direction of x-axis. Otherwise an observer in K would 
conclude  that  origin  of  K  is  in-between  origins  of  K¢  
and  K¢
¢ ,  while  observer  in  K¢  would not find origin of 
¢ .  (This  would  lead  to 
K  between  origins  of  K¢   and  K¢
contradiction  as  seen  from  the  following  example: 
Suppose  a  missile  is  located  just  tow  the  left  of  the 
origin of K (as seen in K) and a missile shield, which 
allows all objects apart from launched missiles to pass 
freely, is located at the origin of K. Then according to 
the observer A, located at the origin of K¢ , observer B, 
located  at  the  origin  of  K¢
¢ ,  could  pick  up  the  missile 
and  shoot  him  down.  However  according  to  the 
observer in K, B would not be able to shoot down A as 
the  shield  would  always  be  in  a  way  of  the  missile.)   
¢  origin of K moves along the negative 
Similarly, in K¢
¢  axis and this completes the proof of 
direction of the x¢
closure. 
 
As K and K¢
but with mutual speed w instead of u, it follows that: 

Where positive square root was taken because for u=0 
transformations must be identity transformations.  
 
We  have  found  the  form  of  transformation  functions 
between two frames in the standard configuration. The 
only remaining unknown is the value of the universal 
constant  m .    From  the  transformation  functions  we 
can make a number of conclusions, for example about 
possibility  of  time  dilation.  Then  we  could  use  time 
dilation experiments (involving decay of stationery and 
moving mesons) to measure the value of  m . Another 
(but  not  the  only)  way  to  find  a  value  of  m is  by 
deriving  velocity  addition  formula  and  observing  that 

if
 and an object moves with  speed  c in one 
inertial frame, then it moves with the same speed in all 
others. This would enable us to identify c as the speed 
of  light  in  vacuum.  But  I  stress  once again that other 
experiments  could  be  used  to  find  the  value  of  the 
constant.

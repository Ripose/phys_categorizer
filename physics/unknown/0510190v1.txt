Abstract  It  is  experimentally  shown,  that  doping  an  organic  molecular  crystal  reduces 
diffusion  rate  of  impurity.  Also  reduces  its  influence  on  a  modification  of  temperature. 
Examinations  are  lead  on  a  crystal  paradibromobenzene  doping  by  paradiclorobenzene. 
Diffusing impurity was parabromochlorobenzene.

applications it is undesirable. There is 
a problem how to reduce agency of an 
increase  of  temperature  on  diffusion 
rate. Diffusion rate is related not only 
to  a  direction  of  migration  of  a 
molecule,  but  also  with  altitude  of

molecule  from  vacancy.  Usually  with

Therefore  it  is  necessary  to  discover 
requirements at which the altitude of a 
barrier  with

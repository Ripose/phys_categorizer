Consider a ﬁber bundle in which the total space, the base space and the ﬁber are
all symplectic manifolds. We study the relations between the quantization of these
spaces. In particular, we discuss the geometric quantization of a vector bundle, as
oppose to a line bundle, over the base space that recovers the standard geometric
quantization of the total space.

I. Introduction.

In [1], the authors considered a family of symplectic manifolds and gave a topo-
logical condition under which these manifolds can be quantized simultaneously us-
ing the procedures of geometric quantization [2] [3]. More precisely, let E → B be
a diﬀerentiable ﬁber bundle each ﬁber Eb is equipped with a symplectic form Ωb
so that {Eb, Ωb} is symplectomorphic to the model ﬁber {F, ΩF }, with structure
group of this bundle preserving the symplectic form. A closed two-form ΩE on E
is termed “closed extension” of the family of symplectic forms Ωb if ΩE = Ωb when
restricted to the ﬁber. The authors showed that closed extension exists if it exists
at the cohomology level. In which case, the line bundle L → E whose curvature is
ΩE pulls back to a prequantization line bundle Lb → Eb. This then allows one to
carry out the necessary calculations on L as a way to quantize the whole family of
symplectic manifolds {Eb}b∈B.

We are interested in the situation where the total space E, the base space B
and the ﬁber F are all symplectic manifolds, and we want to study the relation
between the quantization of these spaces. It is known that if the bundle E → B is
trivial, then the relation between the quantum Hilbert spaces is given by the tensor
product: Q(E) = Q(F ) ⊗ Q(B), where Q(X) denotes the quantum Hilbert space
of the classical phase space X, suppressing in our notation the dependence on the
polarizations chosen for the quantization etc.

Suppose there is a polarization on F that is preserved by the structure group of
the ﬁber bundle, then there is an associated vector bundle V → B whose ﬁber is
Q(F ). Our goal is to give conditons and procedures for quantizing this “prequan-
tization vector bundle” that parallels the standard geometric quantization on line
bundles. The resulting wavefunctions, i.e., sections on this vector bundle covariant
constant along a polarization on B, are vector-valued wavefunctions. This will pro-
vide a nice setup for multicomponent WKB method, since the quantization of E
has both a scalar version (L → E) and a vector version (V → B). Multicomponent
WKB theory has gain recent interest starting with the work of [4].

A detail setup for the quantization of vector bundles will be discussed in section
2, where we state our main theorem. In section 3 we show that the case of a particle
moving under the inﬂuence of an external Yang-Mills ﬁeld ﬁts into our ﬁber bundle
formality. This represents a non-trivial example where the whole system can be
quantized, and the resulting Hilbert space is a twisted tensor product induced by
the Yang-Mills potential. The prove of the theorem will occupy section 4.

II. The Setup.

Let {E, ΩE}, {B, ΩB} and {F, ΩF } be symplectic manifolds, we assume there are
canonical one–forms αB, αE, αF such that dαB = ΩB, dαE = ΩE and dαF = ΩF .
Let P(F ) be a polarization on F . Let π : E → B be a symplectic ﬁber bundle
with ﬁber F , which we assume to be compact and simply connected. We further
assume the structure group preserves the canonical one–form and the polarization.
More precisely, there exist a local trivilization χi : Ui × F → E such that ﬁrstly,
if b ∈ Ui, then χi,b = χi (b, −) : F → Eb satisﬁes χ∗
i,b(αE|Eb) = αF . So ΩE is
a closed extension of the symplectic forms on the ﬁbers Eb in the sense of [1].
Secondly, if b ∈ Ui ∩ Uj, then χij,b = χ−1
j,b χi,b : F → F preserves the polarization
χij,b∗ P(F ) = P(F ).

As a closed extension, the symplectic form ΩE deﬁnes an Ehresmann connec-

tion on the bundle E → B so that for e = χi (b, f ), u ∈ TeE is horizontal if
ΩE(u, χi,b∗ξ) = 0 for all ξ ∈ Tf F . Note that the Ehresmann connection is deﬁned
up to a two–form on B. We denote by v# ∈ TeE the horizontal lift of v ∈ TbB, and
by hor (B) the set of horizontal vector ﬁelds. We make the following observation:

Proposition 1. Let α∇ = αE − π∗αB, and let αi = χ∗
Ui × F , v a vector ﬁeld on Ui, then

i α∇ be the one–form on

v# = v − Hhαi,vi

(1)

where we treat w = hαi, vi as a function on F with b ﬁxed, and Hw is the Hamil-
tonian vector ﬁeld on F deﬁned through the equation ΩF (Hw, −) = −dF w.

Proof. We must show that χ∗
ξ on F . Note that

i ΩE(v − Hhαi,vi, ξ) = 0 for all vector ﬁelds v on B and

ΩF (Hw, ξ) = −ξ(w) = HwhαF , ξi − ξhαF , Hwi − hαF , [Hw, ξ]i.

(2)

Using the facts that [v, ξ] = 0 and vhαi, ξi = vhαF , ξi = 0, we compute

dαi(v − Hw, ξ) = (v − Hw)hαi, ξi − ξhαi, v − Hwi − hαi, [v − Hw, ξ]i

= vhαF , ξi − HwhαF , ξi − ξhαi, vi + ξhαF , Hwi + hαF , [Hw, ξ]i
= −ξhαi, vi + ξ(w) = 0,

since w = hαi, vi. (cid:3)

Suppose we have a polarization P(E) on E that is composed of P(F ) and hor-
izontal vector ﬁelds. More precisely, let e = χi(b, f ), u ∈ Pe(E) implies there is a
uF ∈ Pf (F ) and a uB ∈ TbB ⊗ C so that u = χi,b∗uF + u#
B. So by abuse of notation
we consider P(F ) also as a foliation on E via the trivializing maps χi , our assump-
tion that χij preserves P(F ) implies this push forward is independent on the coor-
dinate patch we choose. And we denote the polarization P(E) = D#(B) ⊕ P(F ),
where D(B) is a distribution on B and D#(B) its horizontal lift.

Let LF be a prequantization line bundle on F and denote by Q(F ) the space of
sections on LF covariant constant along the polarization P(F ), and we will treat
Q(F ) as the quantum Hilbert space for the quantization of F , ignoring potential
complications that may arise from the half-form bundle that appears the process of
geometric quantization. Since F is assumed compact, Q(F ) is ﬁnite dimensional,
we ﬁx a basis {φ1, . . . , φn}. We denote the quantization of the symplectomorphisms
χij,b by Xij,b : Q(F ) → Q(F ). Let V → B be the unitary vector bundle whose
transition functions given by Xij,b and denote by Γ(V) the space of sections.

Let L be a prequantization line bundle over E which pulls back to LF by χi,b.

That is, there is a bundle map so that the diagram

LF −−−−→ Lb

commutes. This will be the case if the connection one form αE on E pulls back
to the connection form αF on F via χi,b , as we have assumed. Since by assump-
tion the transition functions χij,b preserve both the connection one–form and the
polarization, their quantization is by substitution:

Xij,bφ(f ) = φ(χij,b (f )).

Denote by ΓP(E)(L) the space of sections on L covariant constant along the
polarization P(E), and by ΓP(F )(L) the space of sections covariant constant along
the foliation P(F ). Let ψ ∈ ΓP(F )(L), when restricted to a local trivilization patch
Ui × F , ψ(χi(b, f )) must be of the form Ψi
µ(b)φµ(f ). (We will frequently suppress
the index i if no confusion will arise.) Thus we have established an isomorphism
ΓP(F )(L) → Γ(V). Consider the composition

ΓP(E)(L) → ΓP(F )(L) → Γ(V),

the image of ΓP(E)(L) deﬁnes a subspace Γc(V) in Γ(V) that plays the role of
covariant constant sections. One would like to have a connection on the vector
bundle V in order to deﬁne this notion of covariant constant section on V. For
technical reasons, we need to assume that

[hor (B), P(F )] ⊆ P(F ).

where [, ] denotes vector ﬁeld commutator.

Let H : F → R, we denote the prequantization operator [2]

O(H) = −iHH − hαF , HH i + H.

Through out this paper we will let HH to denote the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld on
F with respect to the symplectic form ΩF , and the b dependence that H may have
will be treated as constant in this regard. And h, i is the pairing between diﬀerential
forms and vector ﬁelds, the inner product on Q(F ) is denoted by ≪ | ≫. Let U
be the unitary group of the (ﬁnite-dimensional) Hilbert space Q(F ) and u its Lie
algebra, deﬁne

for all b ∈ Ui. We now summarize our assumptions and state our main theorem:

Theorem. Let E → B be a symplectic ﬁber bundle with ﬁber F and transition
functions χij,b : F → F preserving the connection one–form αF and polarization
P(F ). Let ΩE = dαE be the symplectic form on E that is a closed extension
of ΩF on the ﬁbers. Suppose the Ehresmann connection deﬁned by ΩE satisﬁes
(5). Then Ai in (7) deﬁnes a connection on the vector bundle V → B. Let P(E) =
D#(B) ⊕P(F ) be a polarization on E, and Γc(V) the subspace of sections covariant
constant along P(E). Then Ψ ∈ Γc(V) if vΨ = ihαB, viΨ+ΨA(v) for all v ∈ D(B).

In this manner, the covariant constant condition is given in terms of the canonical
one–form on B, together with the connection A. In general it is not true that a

polarization P(B) on (B, ΩB) will result in a polarization P #(B) ⊕ P(F ) on E. In
vector bundle quantization, one has to deal with the given symplectic form on B,
and the hidden symplectic form on the total space E which induce a connection A
on the bundle. In multi-component WKB theory one faces a similar situation with
two symplectic forms [4].

In our formulation we have imposed two rather strong technical conditions; that
the transition functions preserve the canonical form αF and the polarization P(F ),
and that the commutator between the horizontal vector ﬁelds and P(F ) remains in
P(F ).

The conditions on transition functions are not entirely necessary, it allows us
to keep the technical details to a minimum, in that the quantization of the sym-
plectic transforms χij,b is given by (3). Quantization of non-polarization preserving
symplectomorphisms can be obtained through the use of BKS-pairing [5].
In the
Condition (5) can be considered as a “minimal coupling” condition.
standard Dirac quantization, the momentum variable is quantized as p 7→ d
dq + A
where A is a vector potential. This assignment presumes an interplay between the
polarization (in this case the vertical polarization so that the wavefunctions are
functions on the conﬁguration space) and the connection A. Our assumption (5)
represents an interrelation of this kind.

III. Particles in an external Yang-Mills ﬁeld.

The case of Yang-Mills ﬁeld can be described as follows [6]; Let N → Q be a
principal bundle with group G and connection αYM, the Yang-Mills potential, there
is an αYM−dependent projection T ∗N → T ∗Q. The G−action on N can be lifted
to a Hamiltonian G−action on T ∗N with moment map J : T ∗N → g∗. Let µ ∈ g∗
such that the coadjoint orbit Oµ is integral, and E = J −1(Oµ)/G ∼ J −1(µ)/H be
the Marsden-Weinstein reduced space [7], where H its isotropy subgroup of µ. Let
B = T ∗Q, then E → B is a ﬁber bundle whose ﬁber is F = Oµ, the transition
function is induced by G−action on F , which preserves the canonical one–form on
Oµ. Moreover, there is a standard polarization, the positive K¨ahler polarization,
which is G−invariant. Quantization of F with respect to this polarization gives a
irreducible representation space Q(F ) of G induced by the U (1) representation of
H [8]. These are interpreted physically as the internal symmetries of a particle of
“charge” µ in the conﬁguration space Q. The vertical polarization on T ∗Q lifts to
a distribution on E satisfying condition (5). Thus all the assumptions we laid out
in the previous section hold.

Denote by N # the principal G−bundle over T ∗Q by the pullback

There is a diﬀeomorphism N # → J −1(µ) ⊂ T ∗N given by

(8)

nN , p ∈ T ∗

where ξ ∈ T ∗
n N ⊗ g and the dot product refers to the
pairing between g∗ and g. With these, the prequantization vector bundle on T ∗Q
can be conveniently described as

π(n)Q, αYM(n) ∈ T ∗

V = N # ×G Q(F ) → T ∗Q.

Fix b = (p, q) ∈ B, and v ∈ TbB, there is a natural projection Π : TbB → TqQ.
Let χi : Q → N be a local coordinate patch. In this setting, αE − π∗αB = µ · αYM
and the function w = hχ∗

i α∇, vi : Oµ → R becomes

w(gH) = µ · Adg−1hχ∗

i αYM(χi ), Π(v)i,

where we have identiﬁed Oµ = G/H. Let u be the Lie-algebra of unitary transforms
on Q(F ) and ρ the Lie-algebra representation ρ : g → u. Then one can show that
the connection A deﬁned in (7) is given by

Ai(b)(v) = ρhχ∗

i αYM(χi), Π(v)i

(9)

The Yang-Mills potential αYM also plays a cruicial role in the quantization of ob-
servables on T ∗Q. In particular, the kinetic energy of the particle is quantized to
1
2 (−∆α + R/6) where ∆α is the covariant Laplace-Beltrami operator with respect
to αYM, and R is the Ricci scalar curvature of the Riemannian manifold Q [9].

IV. Proof of theorem.

Our assertion will be proved with a sequence of propositions. We must ﬁrst show

that the inner product in (7) is well deﬁned, recall αi = χ∗

i α∇,

Propostion 2. If φ ∈ L(F ) is covariant constant along P(F ), then O(hαi, vi)φ is
also covariant constant along P(F ). Thus O(hαi, vi) : Q(F ) → Q(F ).
Once we have established that Ai is well deﬁned, we must then show that Ai
transforms like a gauge:
Proposition 3. If b ∈ Ui ∩ Uj then Aj(b) = Xij,bAi(b)X−1

ij,b + dXij,bX−1
ij,b .

Lastly we will show that the connection A has the desired property:

Propostion 4. Let Ψ ∈ Γ(V) and ψ = Ψν φν be the corresponding section in L,
let v ∈ D(B). If v#ψ = ihαE, v#iψ, then v(Ψ) = Ψ (ihαB, viI + A(v)), where I is
the identity matrix so that ihαB, viI ∈ u.

Proof of Proposition 2. Let φ ∈ L(F ) covariant constant along ξ ∈ P(F ), then

ξφ = ihαF , ξiφ.

(10)

(11)

For any ﬁxed b ∈ Ui consider the operator O(w) = −iHw − hαF , Hwi + w where
w = hαi, vi is treated as a function on F . Then

ξO(w)φ − ihαF , ξiO(w)φ = (w − hαF , Hwi) (ξφ − ihαF , ξiφ)

− iξ (Hwφ) − (ξhαF , Hwi) φ − hαf , ξiHwφ + (ξw) φ

Here the right hand side of ﬁrst line in (11) vanishes because of (10). Using (2) we
have

ξhαF , Hwiφ = (HwhαF , ξi)φ − hαF , [Hw, ξ]iφ + (ξw)φ.

Equation (11) then becomes

− iξ(Hwφ) − Hw(hαF , ξi) φ + hαF , [Hw, ξ]iφ − hαF , ξiHwφ

= − iξ(Hwφ) − Hw(hαF , ξiφ) + hαF , [Hw, ξ]iφ
= − iξ(Hwφ) + iHw(ξφ) + hαF , [Hw, ξ]iφ
= i ([Hw, ξ]φ − ihαF , [Hw, ξ]iφ)
= 0

since v−Hw is horizontal by proposition 1, and assumption (5) implies [v−Hw, ξ] =
−[Hw, ξ] ∈ P(F ). (cid:3)

Proof of proposition 3. Here we show A deﬁnes a connection on the vector bun-
dle V. For b ∈ Ui ∩ Uj and v ∈ TbB, we let [Ai(b)v]µν = i ≪ φν | O(wi)φµ ≫
and [Aj(b)v]µν = i ≪ φν | O(wj)φµ ≫ where wi(b, f ) = hαi(b, f ), vi, wj(b, ¯f) =
hαj(b, ¯f), vi with χi (b, f ) = χj (b, ¯f ) = e, so ¯f = χij,b f , and αi(b, f ) = χ∗
i α∇(e),
αj(b, ¯f) = χ∗

j α∇(e). We calculate

wi(b, f ) = hχ∗

i α∇(e), vi = hχ∗

ij αj(b, ¯f), vi = hαj(b, ¯f ), χij,∗vi

= hαj(b, ¯f), v + J∗vi = wj(b, ¯f ) + hαj(b, ¯f), J∗vi
= wj(b, ¯f) + hαF ( ¯f ), J∗vi

(12)

where J∗ is the block matrix in

χij∗ =

I
J∗ χij,b∗ (cid:21)

(cid:20)

: TbB × Tf F → TbB × T ¯f , F

so that J∗v ∈ T ¯f F is a vertical vector. Denote the last term in (12) by β(b, f ), then
we have wj(b, ¯f ) = wi(b, f ) − β(b, f ). Writing out explicitly the dependence on F

[Aj(b)v]µν = i ≪ φν ( ¯f ) | O(wj(b, ¯f)φµ( ¯f ) ≫

= i ≪ φν ( ¯f ) | O(wi(b, f )φµ( ¯f ) ≫ − i ≪ φν ( ¯f ) | O(β(b, f ))φµ( ¯f ) ≫

(13)

(14)

(15)

The ﬁrst term in (13) reduces to

i ≪ φν ( ¯f ) | O(wi(b, f )φµ( ¯f ) ≫ = i ≪ Xντ φτ (f ) | O(wi(b, f )Xµσφσ(f ) ≫

which gives the familiar adjoint action XAiX−1 in matrix notation, here X = Xij,b
as in (3).

As for the second term in (13), suppose we introduce local canonical coordinates
(p, q) around f and (p, q) around ¯f , so that (p(p, q, b), q(p, q, b)) = χij,b (p, q), and
vp is the vector ﬁeld v operating on p as a function on B. In these coordinates,

hαF (f ), Hβi = pmv(qm),

{Hβ, pm} = v(pm),

{Hβ, qm} = v(qm).

(17)

With (15) and (17), we get

Proof of proposition 4. Let ψ = Ψµφµ be a section on L covariant constant along
v#, let w = hαi, vi, then on Ui × F we have

(v − Hw)Ψµφµ = i(hαi, vi + hαB, vi − hαF , Hwi)Ψµφµ
(vΨµ)φµ − Ψµ(Hwφµ) = iwΨµφµ + ihαB, viΨµφµ − ihαF , HwiΨµφµ

(vΨµ)φµ = i (−iHwφµ − hαF , Hwiφµ + hαB, viφµ + wφµ) Ψµ

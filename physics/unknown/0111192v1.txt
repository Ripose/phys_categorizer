Tunneling  time  in  the  case  of  frustrated  total  reflection

D.  MUGNAI  (*),  A.  RANFAGNI  (*),  L.  RONCHI  (**)

ABSTRACT-  The  tunneling  time  is  here  investigated  by  means  of  an  electromagnetic
model,  for  a  system  where  a  gap,  between  two  parallel  planes,  acts  as  a  classically-
forbidden  region  for  an  impinging  pulse  with  incidence  angle  larger  than  the  critical
angle.  In  all  cases  of  frustrated  total  reflection  we  obtain  a  superluminal  behavior  both
for  phase  and  group  delays.

1.  Introduction

The  tunneling  process  represents  one  of  the  most  non-classical  predic-
tions  of  quantum  mechanics.  Inside  this  process,  one  of  the  most  debated
question  is  the  “traversal  time”  that  a  system  spends  during  its  passage
through  a  barrier.  The  question  “how  much  time  does  tunneling  take?”  is
certainly  not  new,  but  it  has  not  yet  been  resolved  due  also  to  the
difficulty  in  obtaining  experimental  confirmation.  The  several  models  hith-
erto  proposed  for  evaluating  the  traversal  time  can  be  roughly  grouped
into  two  main  trends:  the  semiclassical  model  and  the  phase  time  model.
A  third  model  has  been  proposed  by  Büttiker  and  Landauer:  it  can  be
considered  as  a  sort  of  link  between  the  two  above,  since  it  tends  to
reproduce  the  semiclassical  results  for  energy  well  below  the  top  of  the
barrier  and  the  phase-time  model  above  the  barrier  (1-3).

In  the  semiclassical  model  time  ts  is  defined  as  the  ratio  between
space  d  and  the  classical  velocity  v  =  h#|k|/m,  where  k  =  [2m(E- V0)]1/2/h#  is
the  momentum  and  m  is  the  mass  of  the  particle.  It  shows  a  singularity

when  the  energy  E=h#w
0  of  the  incident  particle  is  equal  to  the  barrier
height  V0.  Since  in  the  classically-forbidden  region,  for  E<V0,  the  momen-
tum  is  an  imaginary  quantity,  the  semiclassical  time  is  also  imaginary.

Also  in  this  case,  when  E  >  V0,  we  have  to  replace  k

  with  ik.  In  Fig.
1,  we  show  the  three  models  mentioned  above  translated  into  the  electro-
magnetic  framework  that  is  by  taking  e   =  2p
0/c,  k1  =  2p
/c,  and  once  the
  2p
substitution  m/h#  ﬁ
/c2  is  made  in  the  prefactor  of  Eqs.  [3]  and  [5].
In  this  framework,  the  semiclassical  time  of  Eq.  [1]  becomes  ts  =  2p
.
Tunneling  also  occurs  in  optics,  making  it  possible  to  establish  a  tight
analogy  between  particle  motion  and  electromagnetic  wave  propagation.
The  implications  of  this  topic,  which  are  ultimately  connected  to  the
question  on  particle-wave  dualism,  have  recently  been  discussed  also  in
connection  with  relativistic  problems,  for  the  possibility  of  observing
superluminal  motions  (that  is,  with  velocity  greather  than  light  speed  in

vacuum).  In  other  words,  the  question  “Is  quantum  tunneling  faster  than
light?”  is  now  brought  to  the  bench  (6,  7).

As  is  known,  considerable  difficulties  are  encountered  when  perform-
ing  a  direct  measurement  of  tunneling  time  because  of  the  very  short
times  involved,  which  are  approximately  given  by  the  ratio  between  some
wavelength  of  the  wavefunction  and  a  velocity  comparable  with  that  of  the
light.  With  a  solid-state  device,  the  tunneling  time  involved  may  be,  typi-
cally,  of  the  order  of  femtoseconds.  For  optical  tunneling  in  the  visible
region,  the  magnitude  of  the  tunneling  time  is  of  the  order  of  picoseconds
or  less;  however  a  decisive  increase  of  this  time  has  been  obtained  by
increasing  the  wavelength  up  to  microwaves.  In  this  way,  the  time  scale  is
magnified  up  to  nanoseconds,  and  the  measurements  can  be  easily  per-
formed  (8-10).  An  experimental  device  suitable  for  simulating  quantum
tunneling  consists  of  an  undersized  waveguide  in  which  evanescent  modes
can  take  place.  In  analogy  with  the  quantum  tunneling  of  a  particle  through
a  barrier,  the  waveguide  can  be  regarded  as  a  one-dimensional  barrier  for
electromagnetic  waves.  The  analogy,  however,  goes  beyond  what  is  out-
lined,  since  quantum  tunneling  and  evanescent  waves  are  described  by
closely-related  wave  equations  (11).  The  fact  that  the  results  of  such  a
simulation  are  best  described  by  a  quantum-mechanical  model,  suitably

FIG.  1

Quantum  mechanical  tunneling  time  models,  for  a  rectangular  potential
barrier,  translated  into  the  electromagnetic  framework,  as  a  function  of  the
frequency.  The  lines  denoted  by  ts,  tBL,  and  tf   represent  the  semiclassical,
Büttiker-Landauer  and  phase-time  models,  respectively,  calculated  for  a  gap
of  2  cm  and  a  cutoff  frequency  of  10  GHz.  The  straight  line  represents  the
luminal  (v=c)  limit:  the  tf   curve  becomes  superluminal  below  about  9  GHz
while  tBL  and  ts  cross  this  limit  below  about  7  GHz.

translated  into  the  classical  electromagnetic  framework,  can  be  considered
as  proof  that  quantum  tunneling  can  actually  be  simulated  by  these  kinds
of  experiments.  The  dealy  predicted  by  such  a  procedure  can,  within
certain  limits,  be  paradoxically  small,  implying  a  barrier-traversal  velocity
greater  than  the  speed  of  light  c  (Hartman  effect  (12)).

The  delay  time  in  an  optical  tunneling  experiment  was  also  measured
using  a  two-photon  interference  method.  The  peak  of  the  coincidence
profile  (the  width  of  which  is  of  the  order  of  100  fs)  in  the  presence  of
the  barrier  is  found  “one”  femtosecond  earlier  with  respect  to  photons
traveling  in  the  vacuum  at  the  light  speed  c.  Although  the  apparent
tunneling  velocity  (~1.7c)  is  superluminal,  this  was  not  considered  to  be  a
genuine  signal  velocity  and  the  Einstein  causality  not  violated  (13).

Recently,  delay  time  measurements  in  a  diffraction  experiment  with
microwaves  have  been  performed,  both  for  the  phase  delay  (obtained  di-
rectly)  and  for  the  group  delay  (deduced  from  the  phase-dealy  results)  in
the  range  of  a  few  to  hundreds  of  ps.  The  experimental  setup  consisted  of
a  grating  followed  by  a  paraffin  prism.  For  wavelengths  greater  than  the
period  of  the  grating  (3  cm),  the  diffracted  waves  (of  non  zero  order)
were  evanescent  waves  which  were  transformed  in  real  waves  by  the  paraf-
fin  prism.  The  results  obtained  demonstrated  that  superluminal  behaviour
of  the  phase  and  group  velocities  was  attained  (14).

In  the  present  paper,  we  theoretically  approach  (in  Sec.  2)  the  case  of
evanescent  waves  which  arise  after  total  reflection  from  a  paraffin  prism
(instead  of  a  grating).  The  results  of  this  analysis  are  then  discussed  in  Sec.  3.

2.  Theoretical  analysis

We  consider  here  a  very  simple  system  formed  by  two  half-spaces,
limited  by  the  plane-parallel  boundaries  P
2,  at  z=0  and  z=d,  respec-
tively,  filled  with  a  homogeneous  and  non-dispersive  medium  of  refractive
index  n  (=  1.49  for  the  paraffin),  and  separated  by  a  vacuum  gap  (as  shown
in  Fig.  2).  With  this  type  of  schematization,  we  cannot  take  into  account  the
multiple  reflections  which  take  place  in  the  experimental  apparatus.

1,  P

A  plane  wave  e.m.  pulse,  Ei,  Hi,  impinges  on  the  gap  from  the  left,
with  an  incidence  angle  larger  than  the  limit  angle  i0=sin- 1(1/n)  (.42(cid:176)   for
the  paraffin).  Using  standard  methods,  we  evaluate  the  plane  wave  trans-
mitted  pulse  Et,  Ht,  for  z  >  d  and  its  deformation  with  respect  to  the
impinging  pulse.  From  the  comparison  among  them,  it  is  possible  to  evalu-
ate  the  time  taken  by  the  pulse  to  “travel”  through  the  gap.

A  Cartesian  reference  system  i,  j,  k  (cordinates  x,  y,  z)  is  chosen  with
the  origin  O  on  the  plane  P
2,  and  the  x-
axis  i  in  the  same  plane  as  k  and  the  direction  of  propagation  si  of  the
impinging  field.  For  s,  we  can  therefore  write

For  the  sake  of  simplicity,  we  consider  only  the  TE  case,  in  which
the  impinging  wave  satisfies  the  condition  Ei(cid:215) k=0  (and  Ei(cid:215) si=0).  Accord-
ingly,  we  can  write

where  Z=Z0/n,  Z0  being  the  free  space  impedance.

–

in  the  half-space  z<0,  the  field  is  the  superposition  of  two  waves,  the
impinging  wave  Ei,  Hi  and  a  reflected  wave  Er,  Hr,  (with  Hr=(1/

in  the  gap,  the  field  is  the  superposition  of  two  evanescent  waves,
one  attenuated  in  the  positive  direction  of  k  and  the  other  attenuated
in  the  reverse  direction  - k.  The  former  will  be  denoted  as  “progres-
sive”  wave  E+,  H+,  with  H+=(1/Z0)s+(cid:217) E+,  the  latter  as  “regressive”
(cid:217) E- .  For  s+  and  s- ,  which  turn  out  to

in  the  half-space  z>d,  the  field  is  composed  of  a  single  transmitted
wave,  Et,  Ht,  with  Ht=(1/Z)si(cid:217) Et,  propagating  in  the  same  direction  si
as  the  impinging  wave.

Naturally,  the  continuity  conditions  also  make  it  possible  to  determine

the  amplitudes  of  the  reflected  and  transmitted  fields.

varies.  More  precisely,  if  f >p /4  (G >ng ),  we  have  arg(t )  passing  from  posi-
tive  (for  negative  w
)  to  negative  values  (for  positive  w
).  The  behavior  of

traveling  at  the  light  speed,  as  in  Fig.  4a.

In  general,  the  integration  in  Eq.  [19]  has  to  be  made  numerically.
Alternatively,  by  applying  the  Jordan  Lemma,  the  integration  can  be
trasformed  into  a  series  which  may  be  summed  numerically  or,  in  a  few
special  cases,  depending  on  the  expression  of  A(w
),  in  a  closed  form.
Analytical  details  about  some  special  cases  are  reported  in  the  Appendix.

Figure  6a,  b  refers  to  a  d -function  like  pulse  (case  a  in  the  Appendix)
for  three  values  of  the  gap  d.  Figures  7a,  b  and  8a,  b  show  the  modulus
of  the  transmitted  field  in  two  cases  relative  to  rectangular  and  trapezoidal
pulses,  respectively  (cases  c  and  d  in  the  Appendix).  In  all  cases,  it
appears  from  the  figures  that,  for  small  values  of  g ,  that  is  for  large  G
(Figs.  6a,  7a,  8a),  the  trasmitted  pulse  is  practically  symmetrical  with
respect  to  t=0;  for  the  large  value  of  g   (Figs.  6b,  7b,  8b),  the  trasmitted
pulse  is  strongly  asymmetrical.

3.  Conclusions

Here,  we  have  presented  a  theoretical  analysis  for  describing  the
propagation  of  waves  and  pulses  through  a  forbidden  region  where  evanes-
cent  waves  take  place.  Elsewhere  (15),  we  reported  on  the  results  of  a  two
prism  experiment  in  which  superluminal  behaviors,  both  in  the  phase  and
group  velocities,  are  evidenced  in  the  presence  of  evanescent  microwaves.
Those  results,  analogous  to  those  already  obtained  in  previous  works  (14,
16),  can  be  interpreted  on  the  basis  of  the  analysis  developed  here.  A
similar  theoretical  investigation  was  also  made  in  Ref.  (17),  in  which

n
superluminal  motions  of  electromagnetic  wave  packets  were  predicted.  The
extent  to  which  such  conclusions  can  hold  for  the  signal  velocity  (even  if
limited  to  small  distances,  of  the  order  of  the  wavelength)  continues  to  be
a  debated  and  unresolved  question  also  (and  mainly)  because  of  the  diffi-
culty  in  giving  a  unequivocal  definition  of  this  quantity.  A  crucial  point
could  be  played  by  the  spectral  limitations  (always  present  in  the  experi-
ments)  of  the  adopted  pulse.  The  theoretical  model  considered  here  has
not  this  kind  of  limitation,  but  in  the  numerical  computations  the  finite-
ness  of  the  spectral  extension  is  imposed  by  the  computational  technique.
Therefore,  only  in  the  analytical  results  obtained  for  a  pulse  like  a  d -
function  this  spectral  limitation  is  actually  absent  and  the  result  obtained
appears  to  be  the  closest  one  to  the  case  of  a  true  signal  but  only  from
the  spectrum  point  of  view.  We  cannot  forget  that  the  model  considered
here  suffers  due  to  the  schematizaiton  of  the  problem  (infinitely  extended
boundaries  and  wavefronts).

(and  fall)  time  is  due  to  the  spectral  limitation  in  the  computer  calculations
and,  increasing  the  gap,  originates  the  Gibbs  effect.

The  same  as  in  Fig.  7  for  a  trapezoidal  incident  pulse  Eq.  [A31]  whose

According  to  Jordan  Lemma,  we  have  to  distinguish  two  cases,  namely

the  case  in  which  t+T0<0  and  the  case  in  which  t+T0>0.

For  t+T0<0,  the  integration  path  -

  may  be  closed  with  a  line  at
infinity  in  the  Im  w >0  half-plane.  Hence  I(t,  T0,  m)  may  be  expressed
with  the  sum  of  residues  of  the  integrand  function  at  the  poles  in  the
upper  half-plane,  plus  (one  half  of)  a  possible  residue  due  to  the  function
G(w

For  t+T0>0,  I(t,  T0,  m)  may  be  expressed  with  the  sum  of  residues
(with  the  sign  changed)  of  the  integrand  function  at  the  poles  in  the  lower
half-plane,  minus  one  half  of  a  possible  residue  of  G(w
0)  on  the  real
axis  at  w =w

The  existence  of  a  residue  at  w =w

0  depends  on  m.  For  m=0,  there  is

no  pole  and  no  residue  at  w =w

To  obtain  L(w

),  which  when  introduced  into  Eq.  [A27]  yields  Et,  we
have  to  integrate  the  above  expressions  with  respect  to  time.  By  recalling
Eqs.  [A11]  and  [A12],  we  can  write

Note  that  the  contributions  of  the  residues  cancel  out  in  the  time

intervals  t<- T1,  - T<t<T,  t>T1.

As  the  integration  constants,  we  are  interested  in  those  of  L(t)  or  Et,
not  in  those  of  N– (t,  T0)  separately.  Accordingly,  they  can  be  deduced  by
considering  that

and  that  L(t)  is  continuous  at  - T1,  - T,  T,  T1.  Thus,  for  example,

L(-

)=0

L(- T1+0)=L(- T1- 0).

In  conclusion,  we  can  write

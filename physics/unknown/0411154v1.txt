On the invariant formulation of fluid mechanics 

S.Piekarski 
IPPT PAN 

Abstract 

 
It can be observed that the differential operators of fluid mechanics can be defined in terms of 
the complete derivative on the finite – dimensional affine space. It follows from the fact that 
all norms on the finite – dimensional vector space are equivalent and from the definition of 
the complete derivative on the normed affine spaces (see: L.Schwartz, Analyse 
Mathematique, Hermann, 1967). 
In particular, it is shown that the “substantial derivative” of the standard formulation is a 
directional derivative along the “non – relativistic four – velocity”. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
Some results on the subject of the invariant formulation of continuum mechanics are given in 
[ 2,1 ]
. As we shall see, the formulation given in the present text is much simpler. For the 
convenience of the reader, some facts concerning the structure of the Galilean space – time 
are briefly recalled below (compare

In principle, in order to define the notion of a continuous curve one has to define the notion of 
continuity, but in our case the curve lies in the Galilean space – time, which is a finite – 
dimensional affine space and therefore carries a canonical metrizable topology (obviously, 
this topology is consistent with the “manifold topology”, existing on the finite – dimensional 
affine space as a “finite – dimensional manifold”).

Our aim now is to differentiate 
of the choice of the “derivative” is not quite trivial. The standard approach is to use the 
differential geometry (as described, for example, in Wintgen – Sulanke [ ]3 ). In turn, in [ ]2  we 
used the dual approach of Peradzyński (compare [
). As it has been observed already in the 
Abstract, the most natural definition of differential operators on the Galilean space – time 
is that basing on the complete derivative and the Schwartz’s formalism 
text, we shall use the “affine differential quotient”, which in well – defined on the finite – 
dimensional affine spaces as a consequence of the fact that all norms on the finite – 
dimensional vector space are equivalent. A detail discussion of the relation between these 
approaches shall be given in a separate paper. 
Now, we define the “tangent vector” to the world line, parameterized by the absolute time, 
simply as

According to the general procedure described, for example, by Wintgen and Sulanke (
any coordinate system one can define the fields of vectors tangent to the coordinate lines and 
the corresponding form fields, related by the „duality conditions”. However, the important 
additional property of our space is that the vector fields tangent to the coordinate lines in a 
finite – dimensional affine space can be defined be means of the „affine differential quotient”. 
This property is related to the existence of a canonical complete derivative in the finite –

Till now, we have defined the „four – dimensional” complete derivative of the vector field on

and one can change the inertial coordinate system to the coordinate system with the vanishing 
velocity. Then it is possible to formulate the difference between the “fluids” and the 
„deformable solid bodies” (it depends on the kind of stresses present in the stationary states). 
Of course, we assume the “form – invariance” of our equations with respect to the change of 
coordinates in the inertial atlas. Such requirement automatically ensures the invariance of the 
theory with respect to the automorphisms of the Galilean space –time and it is independent 
from the “principle of material objectivity”.  
In order to write the explicit form of the field equations, one has to define the „gradient of the 
Cauchy stress tensor”. Of course, it is given as the “three – dimensional complete derivative”

quantum gases is interesting because they can be – in a sense – “ideal”, that is, their internal 
energy can be determined by the kinetic energy but they are a bit different from the 
“classical” ideal gases, and this aspect deserves a separate discussion, compare [

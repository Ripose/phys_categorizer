QUANTIZATION ON A LIE GROUP:
HIGHER-ORDER POLARIZATIONS ∗

V. Aldaya1,2, J. Guerrero1,3, and G. Marmo3

November 7, 2008

1 Introduction

Much eﬀort has been devoted to the geometrization of Quantum Mechanics
during the second half of this Century in an attempt to emulate Classical Me-
chanics and Classical Gravity at mathematical beauty and, why not, to better
understand Quantum Gravity. We wish to report on one particular line of
this task, which lies mostly on symmetry grounds and has been developed in
the last years trying to accomodate modern aspects of Quantum Mechanics
such as global quantization of systems with non-trivial topology, in partic-
ular systems suﬀering from topological anomalies, and accounting for more
general obstructions to the basic rules of local quantization, to be referred to
as algebraic anomalies, directly attached to the well-known no-go theorems
[1] of the original, Standard Quantum Mechanics. This Group Approach to
Quantization (GAQ) [2], in some respect generalizes Geometric Quantization
(GQ), originally developed by Kirillov, Kostant and Souriau [3, 4, 5] both
as a method of quantization and as a group representation technique, and

the more speciﬁc representation algorithm of Borel-Weyl-Bott (B-W-B) [6],
which essentially applies to ﬁnite-dimensional semisimple groups.

The idea of turning groups into basic building blocks for the geometric
formulation of Physics is simply the natural result of pushing ahead the old
usage of imposing the compatibility of observer in the same way Diﬀeren-
tial Geometry itself considers admissibility of local chart. The requirement
of a deﬁnite structure in the set of observers, or atlas, delimites seriously
the nature of physical laws in that they must be formulated in terms of say
GL(n, R)-tensors, although this requirement is not restrictive enough so as to
actually “predict” dynamical laws. However, the condition of having deﬁned
an associative composition law in a set of “active” transformations of a phys-
ical system really predicts in many cases its dynamics, and can accordingly
be considered as a basic postulate.

In the particular case of Quantum Mechanics the group structure plays a
preponderant technical role also because, after all, the quantization map has
always been viewed as a representation, in the Lie algebra sense, of deﬁnite
subalgebras of the general Poisson algebra deﬁned on classical phase space.
In this respect, the group manifold along with canonical structures on it will
constitute a powerful tool in the practical construction of the quantum repre-
sentation, mainly due to the existence of two natural, mutually (commuting
left and right) group actions. In fact, one of which can be used to compatibly
reduce the regular representation (or some generalization of it) given by the
other.

However, groups entering the basic postulates of (Quantum) Physics
mostly wear a speciﬁc topological and algebraic structure which goes around
the notion of “extension by U(1)” of both the “classical” symmetry group
and the classical phase space, and we wish to dwell a bit on the necessity of
this extensions.

To help to visualize how the paper is organized, we give a list of contents:

– Why S1-extended phase space?

1.1 Why S1-extended phase space?

In a naive attempt to quantize geometricaly a classical phase space M, i.e.
to represent irreducibly the Poisson algebra in terms of unitary operators
acting on some Hilbert space naturally attached to the manifold M, we are
primarily aimed to consider the Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds Xf associated with
the function f as a “quantum” operator ˆf acting on C ∞(M) by derivation.
In practice, and in the simplest, though rather general, case we start from
R3 and construct the Poincar´e-Cartan form associated
the space R
with a Hamiltonian function H [7] and its diﬀerential, a presymplectic two-
form:

The existence of a non-trivial kernel in the correspondence between func-
tions and Hamiltonian vector ﬁelds is an essential breakdown to the naive
geometric approach to quantizationˆ: f
Xf which would associate the
trivial operator to any constant. The simplest way of avoiding this problem
will consist in enlarging phase space (and/or movement space) with one extra
variable providing one extra component to Xf , and generalizing accordingly
the equation iXf dΘP C =
df so as to get a non-trivial new component even
though f is a constant. On a “quantum manifold” P locally isomorphic to
S1 with “connection form” Θ such that the curvature two-form dΘ in-
M
duces on M a 2-form equal to the one induced by ΘP C, the equation above
can be replaced by the set of equations [5]:

(12)

Unfortunately, the quantization map ˆ is faithful but not irreducible as
a representation of the Lie algebra of classical functions. At this prequan-
tization level, we are only able to reproduce the Bohr-Sommerfeld-Wilson
quantization rules [11]. We know that this representation is reducible be-
cause of the existence of non-trivial operators commuting with the basic
quantum generators ˆK i, ˆPi. In fact, thinking of the simplest case, that of the
free particle for example, and adopting for Θ the local expression,

we get the following basic operators:

(13)

(14)

and it is clear that the operator ∂
∂Pi

does commute with them.

True quantization requires that we determine a subspace of complex-
valued functions on which our quantum generators act irreducibly. We must

then impose a maximal set of mutually compatible conditions in the form
˜XΨ = 0, for ˜X in some maximal subalgebra called polarization. For instance,
in the example above the operator ∂
would become trivial had we selected
∂Pi
our subspace by imposing the polarization condition ∂
=
∂Pi
Ψ(P ). Finding a polarization, however, is not an easy task in general, the
reason being that two polarization conditions ˆaΨ = 0, ˆbΨ = 0 would be
inconsistent, for instance if [ˆa, ˆb] = ˆ1. In addition, once a certain polarization
has been imposed, the set of physical operators that preserve the polarization
is severely restricted.

Ψ = 0, i. e. Ψ

1.2 Why central extensions of classical symmetries?

The close connection between central extensions and quantization is best
illustrated by the simple case of the free particle and its semi-invariance
properties [12, 13], which has its origin in the speciﬁc algebraic structure of
the group. Let us dwell on the semi-invariance of the free particle in both
classical and quantum versions in 1+1 dimensions. The most relevant feature
is the lack of exact invariance of the Lagrangian

under the Galilean transformations:

=

m ˙x2

1
2

L

x′ = x + A + V t
t′ = t + B .

In fact, the transformed Lagrangian acquires an extra term:

which is a non-zero total derivative not aﬀecting the extremals of the corre-
sponding action. The same phenomenon appears at the inﬁnitesimal level.
The inﬁnitesimal generators associated with the ﬁnite transformations (16)

The quantum Galilean particle suﬀers from the same pathology although
it shows up in a rather diﬀerent manner. Let us consider the Schr¨odinger
equation:

Ψ =

The need for a transformation like (24) accompanying the space-time
transformation (16) to accomplish full invariance strongly suggests the adop-
tion of a central extension of the Galilei group as the basic symmetry for
the free particle [15]. The ¯h constant is required to keep the exponent in
(24) dimensionless (of course the particular value of ¯h is not ﬁxed by this
dimensional argument). At this point it should be remarked that the strict
invariance of the classical Lagrangian could also be achieved by a central
extension of the Galilei group by the additive group of the real line (a local
version of the U(1) central extension of quantum symmetry). In that case
the transformation analogous to (24) should be

S′ = S + m(V x +

V 2t) ,

(26)

1
2

where S is the principal Hamilton function, which wears the dimensions of
an action, thus avoiding the need for the fundamental constant ¯h [2].

The successive composition of two transformations in the extended Galilei

group ˜G(m) immediately leads to the group law:

(24)

(25)

(27)

B′′ = B′ + B
A′′ = A′ + A + V ′B
V ′′ = V ′ + V

ζ ′′ = ζ ′ζe

im

¯h [A′V +B(V ′V + 1

2 V ′2)] .

8

The virtue of the central extension is that of making non-trivial the com-
mutator between the generators associated with translations and boosts:
[ ˜XA, ˜XV ] = mΞ, just mimicking the Poisson bracket between p and x (K
and P to be precise) provided that we impose on the wave function the
U(1)-equivariance condition ΞΨ = iΨ. This commutator, responsible of
the (Lie-algebra) extension, will dictate in this and more general quantiza-
tion groups the dynamical character (coordinate-momentum character) of the
group parameters [2].

2 Central extension ˜G of a group G
The case of the 1+1 extended Galilei group ˜G(m)is an example of a central
extension of a group G by U(1). In the general case the group manifold of
the central extension ˜G is the direct product G
U(1), a fact which permits
the parametrization of the group by the pair ˜g = (g, ζ), g
U(1).
However, the composition law does not correspond to a direct product of
groups. Instead, it is written in the form:

G, ζ

×

∈

g′′ = g′
ζ ′′ = ζ ′ζeiξ(g′,g) ,

where ξ is a function with arguments in G. In this way, the identiﬁcation of
˜G will not provide us with a subgroup of ˜G .
elements g
The elements (e, ζ), where e is the identity in G, commute with the whole
group, i.e. are central. For (28) to be a group law the function ξ must satisfy

2.1 Group cohomology

G

×

→

The construction above suggests a cohomological structure. A function
R satisfying (29) is called a two-cocycle, and we say that
ξ : G
two two-cocycles are cohomologous if they diﬀer by a coboundary, i.e. a two-
cocycle of the form (30). The function λ is said to be the generating function
of the coboundary. Central extensions are then characterized by the quo-
tient H 2(G, R) of the set, abelian group indeed, of two-cocycles, modulo the
subgroup of coboundaries, and is called the 2nd cohomology group of G. An
equivalence class in H 2(G, R) will be denoted by [[ξ]]. The general theory
of central extensions was formulated in [15] (see also [16, 17]), and a more
detailled study of Lie group and Lie algebra cohomology can be found in [2],
which includes the connection to symplectic cohomology.

2.2 Cohomology and contractions: Pseudo-cohomology

∈

By pseudo-cohomology we generally mean a cohomology subclass [ξ]
[[ξ]]
that can be distinguished inside the trivial cohomology, i.e. selected from
the coboundaries, according to some additional structure associated with
the group G. Pseudo-cohomology phenomenon was ﬁrstly studied by [18]
and then applied to relativistic quantization in Ref. [19]. The physical origin
of pseudo-cohomology can be easily stated as follows. We start from a given
group G for which we know a central extension ˜G associated with a two-
cocycle ξcob generated by a function λ on G. Suppose there is a well-deﬁned
contraction limit of the group ˜G giving ˜Gc, in the sense of In¨on¨u and Wigner
[20, 21]. This means, in particular, that the two-cocycle ξcob is well-behaved
under the limit process. But it could well happen that the generating function
λ, however, be ill-deﬁned (inﬁnite) in this limit. Then, the contracted two-
cocycle is no longer a coboundary since there is no λc generating it. The Lie

10

algebra structure constant associated with a pseudo-extension, i.e. a central
extension characterized by a pseudo-cocyle, really diﬀers from those of the
trivial product, a fact which requires the non-triviality of the gradient of λ at
the identity of the group G. In other words, pseudo-cocycles are generated by
functions which are, locally, linear functions. For ﬁnite-dimensional semisim-
ple groups, for which the Whitehead Lemma applies [22], pseudo-cohomology
is absolutely relevant and is also related to the ˇCech cohomology of the gen-
eralized Hopf ﬁbration by the Cartan subgroup H, G
G/H, [23]. In the
general case, including inﬁnite-dimensional semisimple Lie groups, for which
the Whitehead lemma does not apply, the group law for ˜G will contain two-
cocycles as well as pseudo-cocycles (see [24, 23, 25]). The simplest physical
example of a quantum symmetry including such an extension is that of the
free non-relativistic particle with spin; the Galilei group must be extended
by a true two-cocycle to describe the canonical commutation relations be-
tween q’s and p’s as well as by a pseudo-cocycle associated with the Cartan
subgroup of SU(2), to account for the spin degree of freedom [26].

→

2.3 Principal bundle with connection ( ˜G, Θ)

Central extensions constitute the simplest, but suﬃciently general, examples
In fact, a
of joint structures which are basic in the quantization process.
central extension by U(1) is in turn a Lie group and a U(1) principal bundle
on which a connection 1-form can be naturally deﬁned. They are trivial as
mere ﬁbre bundle, but not as principal bundles with connection. Of course,
more general groups bearing a non-trivial principal bundle structure, with
structure group H can be considered, but an appropriate pseudo-extension
by a two-cocycle generated by a locally linear function of the ﬁbre parameters
provides exactly the same result [23].

The connection 1-form ˜θ

Θ on ˜G will be selected among the components
of the left-invariant, Lie algebra-valued, Maurer-Cartan 1-form, in such a way
that Θ(Ξ) = 1 and LΞΘ = 0, where Ξ is the vertical (or fundamental) vector
ﬁeld. Θ will play the role of a connection 1-form associated with the U(1)-
bundle structure.

If ˜G is the topological product of G and U(1) (as will be always the case
in all the examples we are considering), the group law for ˜G can be written
as:

≡

(g′, ζ ′)

(g, ζ) = (g′

g, ζ ′ζeiξ(g′,g)) .

Summarizing this section, we can classify the central extensions of G in
equivalence classes, using two kinds of equivalence relations. The ﬁrst one
is the standard one which leads to the 2nd cohomology group H 2(G, U(1)),
where two two-cocycles are cohomologous if they diﬀer by a coboundary. Ac-
cording to this, we associate with ξ the class [[ξ]], the elements of which diﬀer
in a coboundary generated by an arbitrary function on G. With this equiva-
lence class we can associate a series of parameters, given by the corresponding
element of H 2(G, U(1)), and will be called the cohomology parameters. An
example of them is the mass parameter which characterizes the central exten-
sions of the Galilei group. However, the previous considerations suggest that
each equivalence class [[ξ]] should be further partitioned according to what
we have called pseudo-cohomology classes, [ξ], the elements of which diﬀer
in a coboundary ξα generated by a function α on G having trivial gradient
at the identity. Pseudo-cohomology classes are then characterized by coad-
joints orbits of
∗ which satisfy the integrality condition [3] (the condition
of integrality is associated with the globality of the generating function λ on
the group).

3 Group Approach to Quantization

The original Group Approach to Quantization deals with a connected Lie
group which is also a principal U(1)-bundle, either a central extension or
not. The vertical subgroup, U(1), simply realizes the well-established phase
invariance in Quantum Mechanics through the U(1)-equivariance condition,
on complex functions deﬁned on ˜G , intended to restrict this space of func-
tions to the linear space of sections of an associated line bundle. The whole
construction is deﬁned in terms of canonical diﬀerential structures on the
Lie group. However, the quantization formalism can be generalized in two
directions. On the one hand, the structure group can be replaced by a larger,
non-necessarily abelian group T containing U(1). In that case, operators in
T , other than the standard U(1), play the role of constraints as we gen-
eralize, accordingly, the equivariance condition [27]. On the other hand, a
non-connected group can substitute ˜G . To proceed in this way we must re-
place all inﬁnitesimal operations on the functions on the group by their ﬁnite
counterparts. This generalization allows us to deal with groups with arbi-
trary homotopy and therefore to quantize systems the conﬁguration space (or
phase space) of which are not simply connected [28]. We shall be concerned
here with U(1)-principal bundles on a connected base.

3.1 U (1)-quantization

→

Let us therefore consider a Lie group ˜G which is a U(1)-principal bundle with
the bundle projection π : ˜G
G being a group homomorphism. We denote
by Θ the connection 1-form constructed as explained earlier.
It satisﬁes
iΞΘ = 1, LΞΘ = 0, Ξ being the inﬁnitesimal generator of U(1), or the
fundamental vector ﬁeld of the principal bundle, which is in the centre of the
Lie algebra ˜
Te ˜G. Since Θ is left-invariant it will be preserved (L ˜XRΘ =
0) by all right-invariant vector ﬁelds (generating ﬁnite left translations) on
˜G. These vector ﬁelds are candidates to be inﬁnitesimal generators of unitary
transformations. To determine the space of functions on which they should
act, we ﬁrst select complex valued equivariant functions by requiring

G ≡

LΞψ = iψ .

(41)

In other terms, we start with Ψ : ˜G
C and impose the equivariance
condition (41) which identiﬁes them as sections of an associated line bundle

→

14

(see, for instance, [29]). To make the action of the right-invariant vector
ﬁelds on them irreducible, we have to select appropriate subspaces, and this
will be achieved by polarization conditions,

the space of left-invariant 1-forms. We can write

where θLa, θLa+k, a = 1, . . . , k are left-invariant 1-forms. We can deﬁne a
(1,1)-tensor ﬁeld J, a partial (almost) complex structure, by setting:

where θLl are the remaining elements of a basis of left-invariant 1-forms not
appearing in ˜Σ (that is, those related to Ker ˜Σ.). We also have a “partial
metric tensor” ρ by setting ρ(θLa, θLa′) = δaa′, ρ(θLa, θLl) = 0, ρ(θLl, θLl′) =
0.

groups or inﬁnite-dimensional ones possessing a countable basis of gener-
ators for which, for arbitrary ﬁxed ˜X L, ˜Σ( ˜X L, ˜Y L) = 0 except for a ﬁnite
number of vector ﬁelds ˜Y L (ﬁnitely non-zero two-cocycle), and therefore this
partial (almost) complex structure J can always be introduced.

It is possible to associate with Θ an horizontal projector, a (1,1)-tensor
ﬁeld. We ﬁrst deﬁne the vertical projector VΘ(X) = Θ(X)Ξ, and then HΘ =

an isotropic maximal subalgebra. We notice that maximality refers to the
Lie commutator (subalgebra) and not to isotropy (Lagrange bracket).

1-form Θ is associated with a co-adjoint orbit of G, full polarizations satisfy

It should be stressed that the notion of polarization and characteristic
subalgebras here given in terms of Θ is really a consequence of the ﬁbre
bundle structure of the group law of ˜G and, therefore, can be translated into
ﬁnite (versus inﬁnitesimal) form deﬁning the corresponding subgroups (see
[27]).

From the geometric point of view, a polarization deﬁnes a foliation via the
Frobenius theorem. It is possible to select subspaces of equivariant complex-
valued functions on ˜G , by requiring them to be constant along integral leaves
of the foliation associated with the polarization. Whether this subspace is
going to carry an irreducible representation for the right-invariant vector
ﬁelds is to be checked. When the polarization is full and symplectic we
get leaves which are maximally isotropic submanifolds for dΘ. The selected
subspaces of equivariant complex-valued functions on ˜G , which we may call
wave functions, will be characterized by LΞΨ = iΨ, LXLΨ = 0,

.

Finally, the Hilbert space structure on the space of wave functions is
provided by the invariant Haar measure constituted by the exterior product
of the components of the left-invariant canonical 1-form: µ = θLg1
....
The ﬁniteness of the scalar product will eventually restrict the values of the
(pseudo-)extension parameters that characterize the representations.

3.2 Non-horizontal polarizations

We can generalize the notion of polarization introduced above by relaxing
the condition of horizontality, and deﬁne a non-horizontal polarization
as a maximal left subalgebra of ˜

Although this seems to be a more general notion, the following proposition
states that it is related to the previous one.

Proposition: Given a Quantization 1-form Θ and a non-horizontal po-
with respect to it, it is always possible to ﬁnd a left-invariant

Note that, up to an (irrelevant) total diﬀerential, Θ′ coincides with the
quantization 1-form obtained after adding a coboundary generated by a func-
tion λ with λ0
i = αi. Therefore, polarizing with a non-horizontal polarization
is equivalent to introducing a pseudo-cocycle in the group law (and polarize
with respect to a horizontal polarization), and, accordingly, non-horizontal
polarizations can be classiﬁed according to pseudo-cohomology classes. This
equivalence will be exploited in some of the examples. In addition, in gen-
eralizing ﬁrst-order polarizations to higher-order ones, the notion of non-
horizontal polarization will turn out to be a more appropiate one to start
with.

4 Simple Examples

4.1 The abelian group Rk
The simplest example one can think of is the abelian group Rk, with k > 1
(the case k = 1 is trivial, since it admits no non-trivial symplectic struc-
ture). Since the coadjoint action is trivial, all its coadjoint orbits are zero
dimensional. This means that there will be no pseudo-cohomology classes,
and only true central extensions have to be considered.

Given any two-cocycle ξ deﬁning a central extension ˜Rk of Rk, then dΘ,
where Θ is the quantization 1-form, is always left- (and right- in this case)
invariant and exact, but it is not invariantly exact (as a 2-form on Rk), due to
the non-trivial group cohomology of Rk. If we parametrize Rk with (global)
canonical coordinates ~x = (x1, x2, ..., xk), then, since it is left invariant and
the group is abelian, dΘ can be written as:

where aij is an antisymmetric k

k constant matrix. We can choose a two-

dΘ = aijdxi

cocycle representative of the associated cohomology class of the form:

ξ(~x1, ~x2) = aijxi

1xj
2 ,

(49)

any other representative will diﬀer from this by a coboundary that, due to
the trivial pseudo-cohomology of Rk, will contribute to Θ with an irrelevant
total diﬀerential. Therefore, ξ is an anti-symmetric bilinear function on Rk,
and with an appropriate change of coordinates in Rk can be taken to normal
form, in which the matrix aij is written as:

where 0p is the p

with k = 2n + r. The parameters ν1, . . . , νn characterize the extension ˜Rk,
and, thus, they are the cohomology parameters. In physical situations, the
subspace R2n of Rk is the tangent space T (Rn) of a physical system (at this
point there is no distinction between the tangent or the phase space T ∗(Rn),
and we shall consider it the tangent space for convenience). The requirement
of isotropy (under spatial rotations) will ﬁx these parameters to coincide,
i = 1, . . . , n. In this case, the two-cocycle can be written as:
νi = ν,

(52)

where ~q1,2 are n-dimensional vectors corresponding to the ﬁrst n coordinates
(in the new basis), ~v1,2 correspond to the following n “conjugated” coor-
dinates, and ~a1,2 to the remaining r coordinates. Since the two-cocycle ξ

19

does not depend on the coordinates ~a1,2, the group ˜Rk can be written as
Rr, where H-Wn is the well-known Heisenberg-Weyl group with n
H-Wn ×
coordinates and n velocities. The group law for ˜Rk can be rewritten in terms
of the new coordinates:

~q ′′ = ~q ′ + ~q
~v ′′ = ~v ′ + ~v
~a ′′ = ~a ′ + ~a
ζ ′′ = ζ ′ζe

where ω is a constant with the appropriate dimensions (from the physical

for the description of the Harmonic Oscillator; see Sec. 5.2). This polariza-
tion leads to a representation in terms of holomorphic (or anti-holomorphic)
functions on C n. It is unitarily equivalent to the other representations, the
unitary transformation which relates it with the representation in conﬁgu-
ration space being the Bargmann transform. This is also an outer auto-
morphism of H-Wn, but it is inner in a certain subsemigroup of Sp(2n, C)

In this simple example no temporal evolution is considered. This question
will be addressed in Sec. 5.2, with the example of the Schr¨odinger group, the
group of linear canonical transformation acting on the H-W group. Diﬀerent
choices of “time” in it (among diﬀerent uniparametric subgroups of SL(2, R))
will provide us with diﬀerent dynamical systems, like the free particle, the
harmonic oscillator and the repulsive oscillator (see [31]). Each time gener-
ator will select, among the ones considered here, the appropriate (invariant)
polarization.

4.2 The semisimple group SU (2)

Let us consider now an example, which in a certain sense is on the other
extreme to that of the abelian group Rk. It is the semisimple group SU(2),
which has trivial cohomology group, H 2(SU(2), U(1)) = 0. For this reason all
two-cocycles on SU(2) are coboundaries, and they will be classiﬁed according
to pseudo-cohomology classes only.

A group law for SU(2) can be obtained making use of its realization as

left- and right-invariant) on the wave functions is always trivial. Thus, our
Lie algebra decomposes in the direct sum su(2)
R, where su(2) is generated
by X L

Now we should consider central extensions of SU(2), which, due to its

duce an appropriate non-horizontal polarization.

U(1) is simply ζ ′′ = ζ ′ζ
and the generator associated with it, which is both left- and right-invariant,
is Ξ = iζ ∂

trivial, the whole group SU(2) (times R, generated by the gauge generator
X L
) has its inﬁnitesimal generators in the caracteristic subalgebra. A
horizontal polarization would be constituted by the caracteristic subalbegra,
and it would lead, obviously, to the trivial representation of SU(2), with spin

5 Algebraic Anomalies

In Sec. 3, we introduced the concept of full and symplectic polarization sub-
algebra intended to reduce the representation obtained through the right-
invariant vector ﬁelds acting on equivariant functions on the group. It con-
tains “half” of the symplectic vector ﬁelds as well as the entire characteristic
subalgebra. If the full reduction is achieved, the whole set of physical opera-
tors can be rewritten in terms of the basic ones, i.e. those which are the right
J 2
version of the left-invariant generators in J
. For instance, the energy
operator for the free particle can be written as ˆp2
2m , the angular momentum in
3+1 dimensions is the vector product ˆx
ˆp, or the energy for the harmonic
oscillator is ˆc†ˆc (note that, since we are using ﬁrst-order polarizations, all
this operators are really written as ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators).

P ⊕

×

P

However, the existence of a full and symplectic polarization is guaranteed
only for semisimple and solvable groups [3]. We deﬁne an anomalous group
[25] as a central extension ˜G which does not admit any polarization which is
full and symplectic for some values of the (pseudo-)cohomology parameters,
called the classical values of the anomaly (they are called classical because
they are associated with the coadjoints orbits of the group ˜G , that is, with
the classical phase space of the physical system). Anomalous groups fea-
ture another set of values of the (pseudo-)cohomology parameters, called the
quantum values of the anomaly, for which the carrier space associated with
a full and symplectic polarization contains an invariant subspace. For the
classical values of the anomaly, the classical solution manifold undergoes a
reduction in dimension thus increasing the number of (non-linear) relation-
ships among Noether invariants, whereas for the quantum values the number
of basic operators decreases on the invariant (reduced) subspace due to the
appearance of (higher-order) relations among the quantum operators.

We must remark that the anomalies we are dealing with in this paper are
of algebraic character in the sense that they appear at the Lie algebra level,
and must be distinguished from the topologic anomalies which are associated
with the non-trivial homotopy of the (reduced) phase space [28].

27

The non-existence of a full and/or symplectic polarization is traced back
to the presence in the characteristic subalgebra, for certain values of the
(pseudo-)cohomology parameters (the classical values of the anomaly), of
some elements the adjoint action of which are not diagonalizable in the “x
p-
like” algebra subspace. The anomaly problem here presented parallels that of
the non-existence of invariant polarizations in the Kirillov-Kostant co-adjoint
orbits method [33], and the conventional anomaly problem in Quantum Field
Theory which manifests itself through the appearance of central charges in
the quantum current algebra, absent from the classical (Poisson bracket)
algebra [34].

−

The full reduction of representations in anomalous cases will be achieved
by means of a generalized concept of (higher-order) polarization (see below).
Let us try to clarify the situation in terms of coordinates and employing
a rather symbolic language. We may imagine our group ˜G parametrized by
(κ, π; ǫ+, ǫ−, ǫ0; ζ) and with Lie algebra of the form:

The reasoning above suggests another way of looking at anomalies. Let us
start from a doubly extended group ˜G with initially independent (pseudo-)
extension parameters a, k. This involves adopting the following Lie algebra:

both for classical and quantum dynamics. Accordingly, we should have to

where c± are linear combinations of κ, π diagonalizing ˜X L

symplectic polarizations (for k
ǫ0 should be expected to
be expressible in terms of basic operators. However, and this is the remem-
brance of the underlying anomaly, one ﬁnds that for some speciﬁc values of
a, k, actually arbitrary a and a certain k = k(a), the “basic” operators ˜X R
ǫ±
turn out to be rewritten, accidentally, as functions of the originally basic
operators ˜X R
c±. Those speciﬁc values of a, k are the quantum values
of the anomaly, as opposed to the classical values a arbitrary, k = 0. We
thus feel that the non-existence of a full and symplectic polarization, for
some values of the (pseudo-)extension parameters, is more a characteristic of
the anomaly phenomenon than the appearance of deformed terms in the Lie
algebra.

5.1 Higher-order Polarizations

In general, to tackle situations like those mentioned above, it is necessary to
generalize the notion of polarization. Let us consider the universal envelop-
˜
L. We deﬁne a higher-order
ing algebra of left-invariant vector ﬁelds,
G

U

29

6
P

HO as a maximal subalgebra of

˜
L with no intersection
polarization
G
with the abelian subalgebra of powers of Ξ. With this deﬁnition a higher-
order polarization contains the maximal number of conditions compatible
with the equivariance condition of the wave functions and with the action of
the physical operators (right-invariant vector ﬁelds).

U

We notice that now the vector space of functions annihilated by a higher-
order polarization is not, in general, a ring of functions and therefore there
is no corresponding foliation; that is, they cannot be characterized by saying
that they are constant along submanifolds. If this were the case, it would
mean that the higher-order polarization was the enveloping algebra of a ﬁrst-
order polarization and, accordingly, we could consider the submanifolds as-
sociated with this polarization.
In this sense the concept of higher-order
polarization generalizes and may replace that of ﬁrst-order polarization.

We arrive at the formulation of our main general proposition, which had
been proved only for the particular case of the Virasoro group [24]. We should
stress that the introduction of the (left and right) enveloping algebras implies
the use of pseudo-diﬀerential operators. However, there can be non-trivial
operators acting on the Hilbert space of wave functions which are not pseudo-
diﬀerential, and therefore are not contained in the enveloping algebras. This
imply that higher-order polarizations will provide only a Hilbert space on
which any diﬀerential or pseudo-diﬀerential operator commuting with the
representation is a multiple of the identity, but possibly containing invariant
subspaces which are undistinguishable under the action of all the operators
in the group. Such a representation will be called quasi-irreducible.
Proposition: Let
characterized by

HO be a higher-order polarization on ˜G . On subspaces

P

∀

A

(83)
all the right-invariant vector ﬁelds ˜X R act quasi-irreducibly. Therefore the
present quantization procedure gives rise to a quasi-irreducible representation
of the group ˜G, provided it is connected and simply connected.
The proof uses the fact that in a canonical chart at the identity, the group
g proves to be a formal group law [35] and any translation
law g′′ = g′
(composition) on the group admits a unique formal power-series expansion,
as well as the following
Lemma: If ˆO is a pseudo-diﬀerential operator acting on the representation
space in such a way that [ ˆO, ˜X R] = 0 for any right-invariant vector ﬁeld,

i. The same condition is obtained for a

higher-order operator, which can be written as
Proof of the Proposition: let us assume that the set of solutions of the equa-
tions (83) carries a reducible (and not quasi-irreducible) representation of
the Lie algebra of ˜G realized by an inﬁnitesimal left action of the group.
Therefore, and according to Schur’s lemma in it inverse form (see e.g. the
classical book by Wigner [36]), a non-trivial (not a multiple of the identity)
pseudo-diﬀerential operator ˆO must exist, at least, which commutes with
the representation. The previous Lemma then requires the operator ˆO to
have the expression given above, and the fact that this operator preserves
(it commutes with the representation) the solution space of the polarization
it closes

the conditions for a higher-order polarization. In fact, if A is any operator

so that, the right hand side of this equation can only be replaced, at most,
by another element of the polarization A′.
In particular, the commutator
[ ˆO, A] will never be proportional to the vertical generator Ξ. However, this is
precisely the condition for an element in the left enveloping algebra to enter
the (higher-order) polarization. Thus, the existence of such a non-trivial
operators would imply that

HO was not maximal.
In the case of inﬁnite-dimensional representations, the validity of Schur’s
lemma requires the unitarity of the representation, a fact that will restrict,
in general, the values of the central charges, as mentioned above.

P

The deﬁnition of higher-order polarization given above is quite general. In
all studied examples higher-order polarizations adopt a more deﬁnite struc-
ture closely related to given ﬁrst-order (non-full and/or non-symplectic) ones.
According to the until now studied cases, higher-order polarizations can be

A simple example suggesting the generalization of the concept of higher-
order polarization corresponds to the non-irreducible representation associ-
ated with the non-symplectic polarization (99) of the Sch¨rodinger group (see
above). This polarization cannot be further reduced by enlarging (99) to
HO. A full reduction requires the inclusion in
a higher-order polarization
HO of the parity operator commuting with the representation. The gen-

eralization of the concept of higher-order polarization so as to include non-
pseudo-diﬀerential operators, as well as a constructive characterization of
those operators deserves a separate study.

polarization to which it is equivalent. Although we do not give a proof, it
is reasonable that all higher-order polarizations, even if they are not equiva-
lent to a ﬁrst-order one, admit a ﬁnite basis (for ﬁnite-dimensional groups),
and this is what happens, for instance, with the anomalous Schr¨odinger and
Virasoro groups (this last example admits an inﬁnite basis, since the group
is inﬁnite dimensional, but it is countable).

Finally, let us comment on the structure of the wave functions that are
solutions of a higher-order polarization. For the case of a ﬁrst-order polar-
˜X L
ization, the solutions of ˜X LΨ = 0 ,
∀

1 have always the form

∈ P
Ψ = ζeiχ(g)Φ ,

(88)

where χ(g) is a real function on G. The functions Φ are deﬁned on a La-
grangian submanifold S of ˜G (with respect to dΘ). We can think of the

33

unitary operator eiχ(g) as relating the representation in terms of the right-
invariant vectorﬁelds ˜X R acting on the subspace of L2( ˜G) of polarized func-
tions, to the representation in terms of the (ﬁrst-order) diﬀerential operators
iχ(g) ˜X Reiχ(g) acting on the Hilbert space L2(S). Note that the unitary op-
e−
erator eiχ(g) is diagonal, and this is related to the fact that S is a Lagrangian
submanifold of ˜G .

However, for higher-order polarizations, the wave functions, solutions of
HO, do not deﬁne a foliation in ˜G . But they can be written,

AΨ = 0 ,
A
∀
at least formally, as:

∈ P

Ψ = ζei ˆOΦ ,
(89)
where ˆO is a pseudo-diﬀerential operator on ˜G . The reason is that, in general,
the polarization equations have the form, or can be taken (formally) to the
form:

where k is the dimension of

As in the case of ﬁrst-order polarizations, we can think of the unitary
operator ei ˆO as stating the equivalence of the representation deﬁned by the
right-invariant vector ﬁelds ˜X R, acting on the subspace of L2( ˜G) deﬁned by
the polarized wave functions, and the representation deﬁned by the (higher-
order) diﬀerential operators e−

i ˆO ˜X Rei ˆO, acting on L2(S).

To see how a higher-order polarization operates in practice, we shall con-

sider the examples of the anomalous Schr¨odinger and Virasoro groups.

5.2 The Schr¨odinger group

To illustrate the Lie algebra structure of an anomalous group, let us con-
sider the example of the Schr¨odinger group in one dimension. This group,
[3]
or rather, the complete Weyl-Symplectic group, was considered in Ref.
as an example of a group not possessing an “admissible” subalgebra. It is
the semidirect action of the SL(2, R) group on the H-W group (when con-
sidered in n dimensions, rotations should also be included) including as sub-
groups the symmetry group of the free particle, the Galilei group, as well as
the symmetry group of the ordinary harmonic oscillator and the “repulsive”
harmonic oscillator (with imaginary frequency), usually known as Newton

34

groups [37]. From the mathematical point of view, it can be obtained from
the Galilei group (or from either of the Newton groups) by replacing the time
subgroup with the three-parameter group SL(2, R). In fact, those kinemat-
ical subgroups are associated with diﬀerent choices of a Hamiltonian inside
SL(2, R).

In order to perform a global-coordinate treatment of the problem, we
GL(2, R) instead of SL(2, R), and
shall start by considering matrices S
the condition for these matrices to belong to SL(2, R) will appear naturally.
A group law for the Schr¨odinger group can be written as:

write it in this form for later convenience). The factor
action of GL(2, R) is needed in order to have a proper central extension. For
the moment, we shall assign no dimensions to x1 and x2, but if we want
to identify them with q and v of the H-W group in section 4.1, and keep
SL(2, R) adimensional, then it should be x1 = q and x2 = v/ω, where ωis a

Note also that the Noether invariant associated with the generator ˜X R
A + ˜X R
D
is zero, as corresponds to a gauge generator [32]. These relations between
Noether invariants lead to a phase space of the classical theory of dimen-
sion two (i.e. only one degree of freedom). We have obtained this result
because the SL(2, R) subgroup is represented trivially, that is, the two-
cocycle we have chosen for the Schr¨odinger group lies in the trivial pseudo-
cohomology class, associated with the zero-dimensional coadjoint orbit of
SL(2, R). Therefore, only the 2-dimensional coadjoint orbit of the H-W
group is taken into account. See [38, 39] for the study of the Schr¨odinger
group considering all coadjoint orbits of SL(2, R).

As we have seen, the Lie-algebra two-cocycle Σ contains the entire SL(2, R)
subalgebra (together with the gauge generator) in its kernel, which, accord-
ing to the general scheme, should enter any full and symplectic polarization.

(95)

(96)

(97)

(98)

Unfortunately such a polarization does not exist, and this can be traced back
˜X L
to the fact that the partial complex structure J = θLx1
x1
is not preserved by its kernel (the SL(2, R) subalgebra), implying that we
cannot relate it to a complex structure on the classical phase-space. We can
only ﬁnd a non-symplectic, full polarization,

and a series of non-full, but symplectic polarizations. The latters are obtained
by adding, to the polarizations given in section 4.1 for the H-W group, the
gauge generator ˜X L
D and two (properly selected) generators out of the
SL(2, R) subgroup.

A + ˜X L

Quantizing with these non-full polarizations results in a breakdown of the
C and the
x2, as suggested by the relations between Noether invariants

naively expected relations between the operators ˜X R
basic ones ˜X R
(98).

x1, ˜X R

D, ˜X R

˜X R

Furthermore, quantizing with the non-symplectic polarization (99) leads
to an unconventional representation in which the wave functions depend on
both x1 and x2 variables, and contain two irreducible components (see [1]).
˜X R
Also, neither of the operators ˜X R
C , can be expressed in
terms of the basic ones.

B , nor ˜X R

D, ˜X R

In all these cases, the operators of SL(2, R) behave as if they had symplec-
tic content; that is, as if they were associated with a new degree of freedom
(see [38] and [39] for diﬀerent discussions about the meaning of this degree
of freedom). Thus, there is a breakdown of the correspondence between
(classical) coadjoint orbits and (quantum) Hilbert spaces.

Nevertheless, it is still possible to obtain a quantum theory associated
with the classical theory given by the Noether invariants (98). And this is
given by means of a higher-order polarization of the form:

38

(apart from normal order) to making the substitution F i

lations among Noether invariants (98). It should be stressed that the normal
HO of being a
order is automatically ﬁxed, precisely by the requirement for
higher-order polarization. In more general situations, there will be diﬀerent
possibilities in the normal order, in correspondence with diﬀerent choices of
higher-order polarizations.
For each choice of

1, it is more convenient to express the higher-order
terms in a diﬀerent basis, to obtain the representation in the adequate pa-
rameters for the description of the free particle, the harmonic oscillator or
the repulsive oscillator. Thus, the diﬀerent higher-order polarizations could

It should be stressed that all these higher-order polarizations are equiv-
alent, in the sense that they lead to (unitarily) equivalent representations
of the Schr¨odinger group. However, one can select certain uniparametric
subgroups of SL(2, R) to assign a dynamics to the H-W group, and obtain
in this way three diﬀerents subgroups of the Schr¨odinger group: the Galilei
group of the free non-relativistic particle, the harmonic oscillator group, and
the repulsive harmonic oscillator group. The three diﬀerent higher-order

The ﬁrst of these equations has as solutions those complex wave func-

Therefore, the solutions of this equation have the form (once the usual U(1)-
equivariant condition is imposed):

The element J represents a rotation of π

If now one computes the action of the right-invariant vector ﬁelds on these

We can give a more compact form to the expressions of the right-invariant

that we can write χ(τ, y) = ei ¯h

funtion of y, representing the unique degree of freedom of the system. As
indicated in Sec. 5.1, we can obtain the expressions for the action of the

this case S = R), performing the unitary transformation mentioned there;

Note that the operator X HO

D (which is nothing other than the dila-
tion operator) appears with the correct ordering, i.e. it is symmetrized. This
fact is traced back to the form of the higher-order polarization
, which
imposes the correct normal form to all the operators, and that is uniquely
determined by the very deﬁnition of higher-order polarization. That is, with
the formalism of higher-order polarizations there is no need of imposing sym-
metrization “by hand” to the ﬁnal operators.

As commented before, this polarization is adequate for the description of
the free non-relativistic particle. We only have to restrict ourselves to the
subgroup of matrices S of the form:

S =

1 ωt
0

1 !

 

(113)

for which only the generator ˜X R
B , with B = ωt, of the SL(2, R) is relevant.
The parameter ω, introduced in order to have adimensional matrices, will
disappear in the ﬁnal expressions, as expected, since in the Galiei group the
only extra parameter is the mass m (and ¯h). The wave functions, restricted
to the Galilei subgroup, are Ψ = ζei m
ωx2.
The action of the right-invariant operators, once they are reduced to the space
L2(S) (which in this case, and for the operators of the Galilei subgroup, is
expressed in terms of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators), is:

The same precedure can be carried out to obtain the solutions to the
HO
polarizations
~ρ− , and to obtain the usual expressions for the
quantum operators, once we restrict ourselves to the ordinary and repulsive
harmonic oscillators, respectively. We shall not pursue on it, and send the
reader to Ref. [31] for a detailed study on them, although there the quanti-
zation of the complete Schr¨odinger group was not carried out –only the dif-
ferent subgroups were studied separatedly– since higher-order polarizations
were not available yet. This is the reason why in [31] the corrective term 1
2
was introduced “by hand” in the expressions of the operators like ˜X R
˜X R
D,
or in the energy operators of the standard and repulsive oscillators. With
the use of higher-order polarizations this is no longer needed, since all op-
erators appear automatically normally ordered. This is an advantage of the
technique of higher-order polarizations, which is more natural (we believe)
than the “metaplectic correction” (see [11, 40]).

If one wishes to obtain the representation in conﬁguration space for all of
these systems, with higher-order diﬀerential Schr¨odinger equations, one sim-
1, as well as an adequate basis for the higher-order
ply has to choose
terms in such a way that the corresponding Schr¨odinger equation appears,
explicitely, as one of the polarization equations.
For instance, the higher-order polarization,

We shall not solve these polarization equations, see, for instance, [41] and

[42], for the description of the harmonic oscillator in conﬁguration space.

Finally, we would like to make few comments on the geometric inter-
pretation of the anomaly of the Schr¨odinger group. As commented at the
beginning of this section, the classical description of this group leads to a sys-
tem with one degree of freedom, associated essentially to the coadjoint orbits
(for each value of the parameter mω
¯h ) of the Heiserberg-Weyl subgroup. That
is, the SL(2, R) subgroup, lying in the kernel of the symplectic form, is rep-
resented trivially; we are in the trivial (the identity of sl(2, R)∗) coadjoint
orbit of SL(2, R). Therefore, the classical description has the same features
as for any other semidirect product, like for instance, the action of spatial
rotations on the Galilei or the Poincar´e groups (without spin).

However, at the quantum level, meanwhile for the Galilei or Poincar´e
groups ﬁrst-order (full and symplectic) polarizations can be found (see [26]),
that is, they are not anomalous groups, for the Schr¨odinger group we have to
resort to a higher-order polarization to obtain the representation associated
with only one degree of freedom. Computing the Casimir operator for the
SL(2, R) subgroup,

it is easy to check that the representation obtained contains two irreducible
representations of SL(2, R), corresponding to Bargmann’s indices k = 1
4
and 3

16 Ψ (the relation
between the value c of the Casimir and the Bargmann’s index k is given by
c = k(k
1). This means that to construct the quantum representation
associated with the trivial coadjoint orbit of SL(2, R) one must use two
diﬀerent coadjoint orbits, none of them being the trivial one. Thus, the
Schr¨odinger group is the simplest example for which the corresponce between
coadjoint orbits and quantum Hilbert spaces is broken. Another example is
that of the Virasoro group, which will be discussed in next section.

An interesting physical application of this construction can be found in
Quantum Optics –in two-photon systems [43]– where the action of the gen-
erators of the SL(2, R) subgroup represent the emission or absorbtion of
two photons simultaneously. The two irreducible representations of SL(2, R)
with k = 1
4 correspond to the set of states with even and odd number
of photons, respectively, and both sets are needed to construct an irreducible
representation of the whole Schr¨odinger group.

5.3 The Virasoro group and String Theory

the inﬁnite-dimensional Virasoro group. Its Lie algebra can be written as

where c parametrizes the central extensions and c′ the pseudo-extensions. For
the particular case in which c′
N, r > 1, the co-adjoint orbits admit
∈
no invariant K¨ahlerian structure, as was ﬁrstly stated by Witten pointing out
a breakdown of Geometric Quantization. In the present approach, this case
shows up as an algebraic anomaly. In fact, the characteristic subalgebra is
given by

c = r2 , r

PC =< ˜X L

There also exists a full polarization

therein.

the “quantum values” of the anomaly, the representations given by the ﬁrst
order non-full (symplectic) polarizations (120) are reducible since there exist
invariant subspaces characterized by certain higher-order polarization equa-
tions [24]. On these subspaces the operators < ˜X R
l+r >, the right
version of the characteristic subalgebra (119), can be rewritten in terms of
the basic operators ˜X R
r, 0. There is a (standard) anomaly in the
sense that the classical symplectic manifold is reduced (the Noether invari-
ants associated with < ˜X R
l+r > are written in terms of the basic
ones) for the value c′ = cr2 or, equivalently, h =
1)/24, instead of
the values given by (121). Note that there is no one-to-one correspondence
between the values of c′/c characterizing the coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro
group (the classical values of the anomaly) and the values allowed by the
Kac formula (the quantum values of the anomaly), a fact which must be
interpreted as a breakdown of the notion of classical limit.

String theory provides another example of anomalous system with char-
acteristics maybe more similar to the ﬁnite-dimensional case. The symmetry
of the bosonic string consists of an inﬁnite set of harmonic oscillators, the
normal modes, on which the Virasoro group acts by semi-direct product.
That is,

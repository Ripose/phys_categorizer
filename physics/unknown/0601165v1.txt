Three dimensional rotatory modes of oscillations in a one-dimensional chain of rodlike charged
particles or dust grains in a plasma are investigated. The dispersion characteristics of the modes are
analyzed. The stability of diﬀerent equilibrium orientations of the rods, phase transitions between
the diﬀerent equilibria, and a critical dependence on the relative strength of the conﬁning potential
are analyzed. The relations of these processes with liquid crystals, nanotubing, and plasma coating
are discussed.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the
properties of structures involving colloidal charged par-
ticles levitating in a plasma [1–4]. The dynamic proper-
ties of the particle motion, formation of colloidal crystals
and phase transitions in plasma-dust systems are impor-
tant fundamental questions related to the general theory
of self-organization in open dissipative systems [4]. The
cases already studied, experimentally and theoretically,
mostly correspond to spherical dust grains, but there is
growing interest in the properties of colloidal structures
composed of elongated (cylindrical) particles [5, 6] levi-
tating in the sheath region of a gas discharge plasma. In
these experiments, various arrangements of such grains,
levitating horizontally (i.e., oriented parallel to the lower
electrode and perpendicular to the gravity force) and ver-
tically (i.e., oriented perpendicular to the lower electrode
and parallel to the gravity force) have been observed.

It is necessary to stress that for elongated particles,
properties of the plasma environment and especially the
sheath properties are very important [6].
Indeed, the
sheath region is characterized by strong inhomogeneities
of the plasma parameters. In contrast to spherical grains
which can practically be considered as point-like parti-
cles, rods can be aﬀected by these inhomogeneities [6].
However, as a ﬁrst approximation, we assume here the
ambient plasma to be homogeneous; in the case of exper-
imental levitation in the sheath this obviously restricts
the possible rod length (it should be less than the char-
acteristic inhomogeneity scale); however this approxima-
tion can have direct applications even for longer rods for
the (possible future) experiments when the rod structures
levitate in plasma bulk as, e.g., under micro-gravity con-
ditions.

The oscillations of chains of point-like charged parti-
cles have previously been analyzed [7, 8]. Unlike point-
like or spherical particles, elongated rotators exhibit a
number of additional oscillations related to the new (ro-
tational) degrees of freedom [9, 10]. Lattices composed

of rodlike particles will therefore exhibit rotational oscil-
lation modes, analogous to those existing in liquid crys-
tals [11]. It is natural to expect that the excitation and
interactions of all these modes will strongly aﬀect the
lattice dynamics, leading in particular to new types of
phase transitions, as well as aﬀecting those phase tran-
sitions already existing in lattices composed of spherical
grains. Earlier we have brieﬂy communicated the ﬁrst
results of the investigation of lattice oscillations in the
one-dimensional chain consisting of rod-shaped particles
[10] where characteristics of the modes associated with
the motions and rotations of rods in the (vertical) plane
of the chain were obtained. Here, we present a full three-
dimensional analysis of the rotatory modes in the chain
of rodlike particles, and analyze the critical dependence
of the equilibrium and stability of such a chain on the
external potential.

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

Each rodlike particle is modelled as a rotator having
two charges (and masses) concentrated on the ends of the
rod, see Fig. 1, the upper charge being Qa and the lower
charge Qb. For further simplicity, we assume that the
charges are constant and the masses are equal. The rod
of length L, connecting these two charges, has zero radius

and mass. We consider a one-dimensional inﬁnite linear
chain of rods, with their centers of mass evenly separated
by the distance d in equilibrium, along the x-axis. Note
that the approximation of an inﬁnite chain is reason-
able for the several dozens or so dust particles that are
involved in a typical experiment. The one-dimensional
array (chain) of rods is also a good ﬁrst approximation
since, ﬁrstly, such chains can arise in specially designed
experiments and it is therefore important to establish the
role of a coupling potential in the horizontal y-direction
on the stability of the chain, and, secondly, although
the introduction of parallel chains would complicate the
mode structure further, the main mode characteristics for
perturbations propagating along the chain will survive at
least in the linear approximation.

and the interparticle interactions. The external poten-
tial Φext is a combination of the potentials due to both
gravitation and the external electrodes. The interpar-
ticle force is Coulombic in nature. However, since the
dust grain is shielded by the surrounding plasma, there
is an exponential decay of the interparticle potential with
distance, as follows;

where the sum is over all the particles, and I is the com-
mon rotational inertia of each particle. Here θ is the
angle the rod makes with the z (vertical) axis, and φ is
the angle the projection of the rod onto the x
y (hori-
zontal) plane makes with the x-axis (the direction of the
chain of particles), see Fig. 1. The ﬁrst two terms on
the right hand side correspond to the kinetic energy, and
terms like QaΦa describe the interaction on the upper
charge Qa of the nth particle with the potential Φa due
to the upper charges Qa of all the other particles, etc.
(The force between the upper and lower charges on a
single particle is of course balanced by the stress in the
rod connecting them). Note the summation implied in
the calculation of Φa, b for the nth particle is, in princi-
ple, over all the other particles. However, we shall only
allow the two nearest neighbor interactions in our ap-
proximation due to the screened Coulomb nature of the

that highly charged rods can appear at distances signiﬁ-
cantly less than Debye length. Note that the separation
between rods is an adjustable parameter in our calcula-
tions. This separation depends on the parameters of the
in the experiments [6], it varies from 1 mm to
plasma:
0.3 mm. This scale length is more than or of the order of
the Debye length for the experiments, and this justiﬁes
our assumption of the nearest neighbor interactions.

Modes associated with the center of mass motion
are analogous to those in chains of spherical particles
[7, 8, 10] so here we investigate the rotational behavior,
unique for rodlike particles, in detail. The Euler La-

grange equations of angular motion can then be written
down for the nth particle,

d

∂ ˙θn

and similarly for φn.

In order to compute these derivatives we must write
down the displacement vectors from each charge to each
neighboring charge. Let Rn locate the center of mass of
the nth dust grain, relative to the equilibrium position.
We then deﬁne Sn to be the direction of the upper charge
relative to the center of mass, so in spherical co-ordinates

Sn = (cos φn sin θn, sin φn sin θn, cos θn) .

Similar equations exist for the vectors from the charges
on the (n

1)th grain to the charges on the nth grain.

The external potential can be approximated by a
parabolic potential for small oscillations, whose minimum
lies at the center of mass of a rod (y = 0, z = 0). The as-

−

sumption of an inﬁnite chain in the x-direction removes
the need for a conﬁning potential in that direction. The
external potential is therefore assumed to act in both
the z (vertical) and y directions, such that the potential
energy of the rod is, with coordinates , is

QaΦext(an) + QbΦext(bn) = kyy2 + kzz2,

(11)

where (y, z) are the coordinates of the upper charge Qa.
Note that the y-component of the external potential is
purely electrical and the z-component is a combination
of the electric and gravitational potentials.

Use of the chain rule now gives rise to the following
equation of motion for θn, including only the two nearest
neighbor particle interactions:

earize these equations about an equilibrium position. We
shall call the equilibrium colatitudinal and azimuthal an-

gles, about which we consider small perturbations, θ0
and φ0 respectively, which are common to all particles.
The analysis then proceeds as follows:
let ǫ be a small
perturbation of θ, so that θn = θ0 + ǫn; we may then
approximate

sin θ0ǫn,
sin θn = sin θ0 + cos θ0ǫn,

and similarly for φ by letting η be a small perturbation
from φ0. Note that the linearising process for terms like
Φ′
in fact involves taking the zeroth and ﬁrst
order terms in a Taylor expansion of six variables, namely
ǫn, ǫn+1, ǫn−1, ηn, ηn+1, ηn−1. The full result for θn is
long and complicated, and is written down in the Ap-
pendix, Eqn. (31). We simply note that it is coupled and
has only a numerical solution.

We next determine the common equilibrium orienta-
tion of the particles. Thus we set ǫn = ǫn+1 = ǫn−1 =
ηn = ηn+1 = ηn−1 = 0, and let the acceleration ¨θn be
zero. We ﬁnd

where each term is to be evaluated at the relevant equi-
librium orientation. This tells us the form of external po-
tential required for an equilibrium orientation of (θ0, φ0).
However, as indicated earlier, the external potential of
relevance to us is parabolic about the center of mass ,
equation (11).

Thus the external potential derivatives at each charge
should vanish at the equilibrium; this occurs only at the y
and z axes for a potential of the form (11), unless ky = kz.
Similarly we must ensure

(17)

The result is that equilibria exist in only the following
orientations (unless ky = kz); (θ0, φ0) = (0, φ0) (with
φ0 arbitrary) or (π/2, 0) or (π/2, π/2), which we draw
successively as shown in Fig. 2 (a), (b), and (c), respec-
tively. If ky = kz, equilibrium exists for the orientation
(θ0, π/2), where θ0 is arbitrary.

Recall that the chain of rods is located along the x-axis,
so that the ﬁrst and the third equilibria are essentially
the same, the only diﬀerence lying in the interaction with
the external potential. The analysis of oscillations about
these equilibria shall occupy the bulk of this paper. Os-
cillations in θ about the second equilibrium have already

4

been considered in Ref. [10], and oscillations in φ about
that equilibrium can be obtained simply by exchanging
ky and kz. Since φ is undeﬁned for a vertically oriented
rod, we concentrate here on the horizontal equilibrium
case (π/2, π/2).

III. AZIMUTHAL MOTION

The perturbation equation describing small oscillations
in azimuthal angle φn about the equilibrium Fig. 2(c),
θ = π/2, φ = π/2, can be obtained from Eqn. (31) (see
Appendix) for the θ perturbation equation by rotating
the y- and z-axes about the x-axis, so the new z-axis lies
along the old y-axis. The equilibrium is now, in terms of
the new polar angles, (θ′
0 = 0, φ′
0 = 0), and the pertur-
bation η in the old angle φ is the negative of the pertur-
bation η′ in the new angle θ′. The resulting equation for
η is

(In fact they decouple in all the above three equilibrium
ηn−1 in the ﬁrst
cases.) Note the presence of 2ηn
term. This term will vanish if all the rods rotate together.
If we consider the upper charges Qa all moving together,
it is apparent that this interaction should vanish, as a
1)th and (n + 1)th charges pushing in
result of the (n
equal and opposite directions. However in the second
term, the term 2ηn + ηn+1 + ηn−1 will not vanish. This
is a consequence of the fact that as the rods rotate, the
cross interaction between Qa and Qb (on adjacent rods)
increases as they come closer together. The (n + 1)th and
(n

1)th contributions become unbalanced.

Hence the product QaΦ′
a is pos-
itive, as is true for any potential that falls oﬀ with dis-
tance. The result is that the coeﬃcients of the oscillatory
sine and cosine terms in Eq. (19) are always positive.
Thus the dust particles would always exhibit stable os-
kyL2/2
cillations, except for the presence of the term
from the external potential, which acts to pull the grains
away from this equilibrium to the x-axis (where y = 0).
These competing terms may then give rise to regions of
stable behavior and regions of unstable behavior. Re-
call that the moment of inertia is I = mL2/2. Hence
the factor L2 cancels throughout and is only present,
implicitly, through the quantity Ld. We may plot the
dispersion relation, by selecting some typical values of
the parameters involved: m = 10−15kg, Q = 103e to
104e, and λD = 300µm. For the case d
λD, and for
the particular choice of the external potential parameter
−2 (which can be controlled in an exper-
ky = 10−10kg s
iment), the resulting dispersion relation is shown in Fig.

Note that the vertical axis is for the square of the nor-
malized frequency (ω/ω0)2, where ω0 is a typical dust
plasma frequency with ω2
D), which is
normally a few hundred radians per second. The hori-
zontal axis is a normalized wavenumber kλD for the ﬁrst
Brillouin zone. This plot clearly shows stable regions,
corresponding to ω2 > 0, and unstable regions corre-
sponding to ω2 < 0 (i.e ω imaginary.)

0 = 3Q2/(4πε0mλ3

For a typical choice of the wavenumber, we can plot
(ω/ω0)2 as a function of a normalized interparticle dis-

5

tance d/λD, (since d is typically of the order of the Debye
length), as shown in Fig. 4. Clearly at close interparti-
cle distances the motion is stable, as the particles oscil-
late under their mutual repulsion. However at large dis-
tances the external potential dominates, and the motion
becomes unstable. This is a result of the interparticle
force decreasing with distance. Note that this instability
will always arise at large distances, if ky > 0. We reiter-
ate that this horizontal motion is identical to the vertical
case under the interchange ky

kz.

Here the ﬁrst term on the right hand side is independent

rotation of the nth dust grain sets up oscillations since it
becomes closer to the center of mass (and hence the dust
particle on average) of the relevant nearest neighbor, re-
gardless of the neighbor’s orientation. This is embodied

Once again note the oscillatory dependence on wavenum-
ber. The ﬁrst term on the right hand side is this time neg-
ative, since QΦ′(r) < 0 and d < Ld. Thus the dust par-
ticle’s mutual repulsion causes instability. This results
from the QaΦa interaction pushing away from equilib-
rium, dominating the cross interaction QaΦb that pushes
back. Once again it is the fact that the dust grain’s
Debye-Coulomb potential falls oﬀ with distance that a
net force results. Note the competing terms from the ex-
ternal potential. In the horizontal case one needs kz > ky
for the possibility of stability (of course wavenumber gaps
are still possible). Note that similar dependence exhibit
pairs of unbound spherical particles levitating in the con-
ﬁning potential in x- and z-directions [12]. We also recall
that the interchange kz
ky gives the vertical equilib-
rium case. By selecting kz > ky the dispersion relation
will be qualitatively the same as in Fig. 3.

the azimuthal oscillation case, as shown in Fig. 5. Note
the reversed characteristic, where stability now increases
as the particles get further apart. We explain this as
follows: at close distances the motion is highly unstable,
since the repulsion due to the QaΦa and QbΦb terms is
so strong. However in the far region, it is the sign of

We see that the oscillations become solely due to the
conﬁning potential as L

competing terms in the coeﬃcient of sin2(kd/2) in equa-
tion (26) have cancelled one another. Note however that
it is not strictly valid to let L = 0, since we cannot mean-
ingfully discuss rotation of a rod with no length, and we
have already divided by L2.

INSTABILITY

We now address the important issue of what happens
Instability implies that the
if the motion is unstable.
rods may switch from the horizontal to the vertical equi-
librium (or vice versa) depending on the sign of kz
ky.
However, our analysis is only valid for small perturbation
angles, and breaks down at large amplitudes. In order to
examine what ensues if the rods lie near an unstable ori-
entation we must consider what will happen physically:
the rods will in fact move in opposite directions to move
away from one another. Thus on the average, the even
rods, say, will move clockwise and the odd rods counter-
clockwise (or vice versa). Hence it may be that there ex-
ists some intermediate value of stability between the ver-
tical and horizontal. Our analysis is diﬀerent now from

earlier, since we are allowing alternate rods to have oppo-
site equilibrium orientations. By considering the vertical
θ0 alter-
case, this corresponds to equilibria at θ0 and
nately. Let the even rods be described by perturbations
ǫn in θ as before, and the odd neighbors by ζ n−1 and ζ n.
The equilibrium condition is now found to be given by

on the plasma parameters. If the ionization percentage
is low then the friction due to neutrals will dominate. If
the ionization is high, then the friction from ions becomes
important also. Now since the Lagrangian formulation
cannot deal with non-conservative forces such as friction,
we can only include friction after we have ascertained the
equations of motion.

Thus, in the linear approximation, we may include a
generic γ ˙θ term, where γ is the frictional constant. Thus
equation (24) becomes

Thus equilibrium occurs if θ0 = 0 (the vertical case), or
θ0 = π/2 (the horizontal case), or if the term in brackets
in (27) vanishes. In the case where kz = ky, and when
Qa = Qb, an equilibrium occurs at θ0 = π/4, when the
charges are furthest away from one another, and neigh-
bors are out of phase by π/2. In this case the right hand
side of the perturbation equation (28) vanishes; this is
because for an external potential symmetric about the x
axis, an arbitrary rotation of θ0 may be made, as long as
neighbors are at right angles to each other. If the poten-
tial is not symmetric (ky
= kz), equilibria may occur at
intermediate angles diﬀerent to θ0 = π/4.

Hence the described system of rods can undergo phase
transitions from one state to another i.e vertical to hori-
zontal and vice versa, or to an intermediate equilibrium,
dependent on the easily adjustable external potentials.
In fact it is a natural extension to see that this is also
true of the third equilibrium case mentioned in Section II,
corresponding to the equilibrium at (π/2, 0). Transitions
between the vertical and horizontal equilibria have been
observed in experiments [6]. This process has a relation
to processes in liquid crystals [11], where a state of mat-
ter exists between the solid and liquid phases, wherein
rod shaped molecules exhibit a partial alignment, rather
than a rigid array seen in crystals. The direction of this
partial alignment (and phase) can be altered by an ex-
ternal inﬂuence.

VI. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The above analysis has ignored an important real fea-
ture of plasmas: friction. The motion of dust particles
through the plasma medium will induce a resistive re-
sponse from the plasma. Friction’s importance depends

where the term

γ2/4I 2 shows a decrease in frequency. Note criti-
cal damping occurs when ω2 = γ2/4I 2. Further general-
p
izations of the main results taking into account friction
are straightforward. We note that the actual friction with
neutral particles is geometry dependent. In the case of
the adopted model of a rotator with two spherical ball-
like particles connected by the inﬁnitely thin rod the fric-
tion constant gamma which is determined by the neutral
gas pressure and the cross-section (i.e. geometry) is just
twice that of the single spherical particle. In the case of
the real rod geometry with ﬁnite rod radius the friction
constant will naturally depend on the particular geome-
try. Note that the wave damping is also determined by
the moment of inertia as can be seen from Eq. (30).

We began by noting that in a plasma, dust particles
usually acquire a negative charge, and so can levitate if
a negatively biassed electrode is placed below them. The
case of a one-dimensional chain of levitating rod shaped
particles was investigated; we found that the diﬀerent
rotational modes of oscillation decoupled in the linear
approximation. The speciﬁc behavior of the modes was
analyzed through the dispersion relations. An oscillatory
dependence on wavenumber was found, and a critical de-
pendence on the relative strengths of the conﬁning poten-
tial. The characteristic frequency range for these oscilla-
tory modes is of the order of the dust plasma frequency
ω0, as can be seen from Figs. 3–5. We note that the os-
cillations of rodlike particles also show modes associated
with the motion of the center of mass of the rods. Dis-
persion characteristics of these modes are similar to those
of spherical particles of comparable mass and charge, see
[10], namely, the optic-mode like “bending” mode related
to vertical motions of the centers of mass, and the acous-
tic mode related to horizontal (in the direction of the

6
mode propagation) motions of the centers of mass. The
characteristic frequency of the ﬁrst mode is determined
by the conﬁning potential in the vertical direction; in ex-
periments, and this frequency can be of the order of or
higher than the dust plasma frequency depending on the
particular experimental conditions [13]. The characteris-
tic frequency range of the acoustic dust-lattice mode is
lower, ranging from zero to ω0. The azimuthal and co-
latitudinal modes showed opposite characteristics in the
near and far interparticle distance regimes, respectively.
The rods were then shown to move, or switch to the rele-
vant equilibrium, dependent on the conﬁning parameters.
This is an example of a phase change phenomenon which
is analogous to that observed in liquid crystals. The in-
clusion of the resistive eﬀect of friction was an immediate
and straightforward extension.

The ability to line up rods in diﬀerent directions, by al-
ternating the relative sizes of the conﬁning potentials, is a
powerful tool. This can be of use in, for example, plasma
coating, if rod shaped objects are used as the basis to give
strength to a material. The nanotube industry is another
new area where this may ﬁnd application. The elongated
shape of these carbon based molecules shows an obvious
connection to our discussion of ‘rods’, although the par-
ticular rod shape analyzed in this paper is just a ﬁrst
approximation to the true geometry of a nanotube [14].
We have neglected here some other plasma eﬀects, such
as the production of wakes due to the ion ﬂow to the elec-
trode. Since we consider dust charge interactions primar-

8

ily in the horizontal plane, the modiﬁcation of the Debye
potential by the wake is only weak. We note that the
ion wake eﬀects can cause instabilities in the horizon-
tal lattice wave propagation; for spherical particles this
was shown in Ref.
[15]. It is natural to expect a simi-
lar type of instability for the arrays of rods, and this is
an interesting topic for future research. Also, for verti-
cally oriented chains of dust charges, the wake potential
has large eﬀects (for chains of spherical grains, this was
demonstrated in Ref.
[16]). Finally, for structures lev-
itating in the plasma bulk (as e.g. under micro-gravity
conditions), the ion ﬂow is absent.

There are several possibilities for further work. Firstly,
the charge is in fact a function of vertical height, Q =
Q(z). Next, the extension to a 2 or 3 dimensional array
may lead to further interesting results. An important ex-
tension is to a general charge distribution along the rod,
rather than the two-point particles we have considered.
Finally, by including higher order terms in the analysis,
nonlinear waves and excitations as well as their interac-
tions can be investigated in such chains.

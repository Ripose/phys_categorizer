In  preparation  to  the  experimental  results  which  will  be  available  in  the  future,  we  study  geo-neutrino 

production for different models of mantle convection and composition. By using global mass balance for the 

Bulk Silicate Earth, the predicted flux contribution from distant sources in the crust and in the mantle is fixed 

within a total uncertainty of ±15%. We also discuss regional effects, provided by subducting slabs or plumes 

near the detector. In four years a five-kton detector operating at a site relatively far from nuclear power plants 

can achieve measurements of the geo-neutrino signal accurate to within ±5%. It will provide a crucial test of the 

Bulk Silicate Earth and a direct estimate of the radiogenic contribution to terrestrial heat.

1. Introduction  

 

The nature and scale of mantle convection and the thermo-chemical evolution of Earth’s 

mantle are still far from an appropriate understanding despite the range of observations and 

constraints provided by different scientific disciplines in the past half century. Arguments 

of  mass  balance  and  radioactive  decay  has  lead  to  the  canonical  model  of  separated 

convective  regimes  with  little  or  no  mass  flux  between  them.  This  paradigm  has  been 

severely  challenged  by  mineral  physics  experiments,  seismological  observations  and 

tomographic  images,  although  the  antagonistic model of whole-mantle convection reveals 

also unable to reconcile all of the geochemical and geophysical aspects.  

Earth scientists now share the view that a better understanding of how the mantle really 

works  can  be  achieved  only  by  a  combined  approach  in  which  all  of  the  concepts  and 

constraints  emerging  from  the  latest  developments  of  formerly  separate  and  competing 

disciplines are pieced together in new classes of convection models. These models can be 

elaborated  on  and  tested  by  geodynamic,  seismological,  mineralogical  and  geochemical 

studies and may now include additional evidence from geo-neutrino detection. 

Geo-neutrinos can be regarded as a new probe of our planet, that is becoming practical 

thanks  to  very  recent  and  fundamental  advances  in  the  development  of  extremely  low 

background  neutrino  detectors  and  in  understanding  neutrino  propagation.  Geo-neutrino 

detection  can  shed  light  on  the  sources  of  the  terrestrial  heat  flow,  on  the  present 

composition and on the origin of the Earth, thus providing a direct test of the Bulk Silicate 

Earth model and a check for non conventional models of Earth’s core. 

By looking at antineutrinos from nuclear reactors, the Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Anti-

Neutrino  Detector  (KamLAND)  [1]  has  confirmed  the  oscillation  phenomenon  previously 

discovered  by  the  Sudbury  Neutrino  Observatory  (SNO)  [2]  with  solar  neutrinos  and  has 

provided  crucial  information  on  the  oscillation  parameters.  Since  we  know  their  destiny 

from  production  to  detection,  neutrinos  can  now  be  used  as  physical  probes.  Furthermore, 

the  detector  is  so  pure  and  the  sensitivity  is  so  high  that  KamLAND  will  be  capable  of 

studying  geo-neutrinos,  the  antineutrinos  originating  from  Earth’s  natural  radioactivity. 

Indeed, from a fit to the first experimental data the KamLAND collaboration reported four 
events  associated  with  238U  and  five with  232Th decay chains [1]. This result provides the 

first  insight  into  the  radiogenic  component of  terrestrial  heat.  A  new  window  for  studying 

2

 

Earth’s interior has been opened and one expects more precise results in the near future from 

KamLAND and other detectors which are presently in preparation. 

Recently,  a  reference  model  of  geo-neutrino  fluxes  has  been  presented  in  [3].  The 

Reference  Earth  Flux  model  (REF)  is  based  on  a  detailed  description  of  Earth's  crust  and 

mantle and takes into account available information on the abundances of Uranium, Thorium 

and Potassium -  the most important heat and neutrino sources - inside Earth's layers. This 

model has to be intended as a starting point, providing first estimates of expected events at 

several  locations  on  the  globe.  In  preparation  to  the  experimental  results  which  will  be 

available  in  the  future,  from  KamLAND  as  well  as  from  other  detectors  which  are  in 

preparation,  it  is  useful  to  consider  geo-neutrino  production  in  greater  depth,  for 

understanding what can be learnt on the interior of the Earth from geo-neutrino observations.  

The REF model was built within the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) framework. The amounts 

of Uranium, Thorium and Potassium in the crust and in the upper mantle were derived from 

observational  data.  The  content  of  radiogenic  material  in  the  lower  part  of  the  mantle  was 

estimated  from  mass    balance  within  BSE.  We  remind  that  BSE  estimates  for  the  total 

amounts  of  Uranium,  Thorium  and  Potassium  from  different  authors  [4,  5,  6,  7]  are  quite 
concordant within 10%, the central values being  mBSE = 0.8⋅1017 kg for Uranium, 3.1⋅1017 kg 
for  Thorium,  and  0.9⋅1021  kg  for  Potassium.  These  values  can  be  taken  -  within  their 

uncertainties - as representatives of the composition of the present crust  plus mantle system. 

Different models can provide different distributions between crust and mantle, however 

for each element the sum of the masses is fixed by the BSE constraint. This clearly provides 

constraints on the geo-neutrino flux which are grounded on sound geochemical arguments. 

Alternatively – and this is the main point of the present paper – geo-neutrino detection can 

provide a test of an important geochemical paradigm.  

Briefly, in this paper we shall address three questions: 

(i) How sensitive are the predicted geo-neutrino fluxes to uncertainties about the mechanism 

of mantle circulation? 

(ii) Is it possible to test the Bulk Silicate Earth model with geo-neutrinos? 

(iii) Can geo-neutrino detection be sensitive to peculiar mantle structures (e.g. plumes)? 

We  shall  restrict  the  discussion  to  geo-neutrinos  from  Uranium  progeny,  which  are  more 

easily detectable due their higher energy. Extension to the other chains is immediate.

In this paper, after reviewing the status of the art for neutrino detection and geo-neutrino 

modelling,  we  discuss  the  effect  of  different  models  for  mantle  structure  and  composition 

and  determine  the  range  of  fluxes  which  are  consistent  with  the  BSE  constraint.  The 

influence  of  local  structures  of  the  crust  and  mantle  is  also  discussed,  by  considering  the 

effects of subducting slabs and of emerging plumes. The detector size needed for testing the 

BSE model is estimated. Our findings are summarized in the concluding remarks.  

In this section we shortly review the method for detecting anti-neutrinos and discuss the 

main ingredients of the reference model, providing a summary of  its main predictions for 

geo-neutrino  fluxes  and  event  yields,  referring  to  [8]  and  [3]  for  a  more  detailed

presentation.  

2.1. Anti-neutrino detection 

 

Already  in  1946  Bruno  Pontecorvo  [9]  suggested  to  use  nuclear  reactors  in  order  to 

perform  neutrino  experiments.  Indeed,  in  1953-1959  Reines  and  Cowan  [10]  showed  that 

anti-neutrinos  are  real  particles  using  nuclear  reactors  as  a  source.  Since  then,  nuclear 

reactors  have  been  extensively  used  to  study  neutrino  properties.  The  KamLAND 

experiment  represents  the  culmination  of  a  fifty  year  effort,  all  using  the  same  method  

which was applied by Reines and Cowan. 

The  inverse β-decay  reaction,

(where

eν and  p  in  the  left  side  are  the 

anti-neutrino  and  proton,  respectively,  e+  and  n  in  the  right  side  denote  the  neutron  and 

positron,  respectively),  is  used  to  detect 

eν ’s  with  energies  above  1.8  MeV  in  liquid 

scintillator. The prompt signal from the positron and the 2.2 MeV γ-ray from neutron capture 

on a proton in delayed coincidence provide  a powerful tool for reducing background and to 

reveal the rare interaction of antineutrinos (Fig. 1). The primary goal of KamLAND was a 

search  for  the  oscillation  of 

eν ’s  emitted  from  distant  power  reactors.  The  long  baseline, 

typically  180  km,  enabled  KamLAND  to  address  the  oscillation  solution  of  the  ‘solar 

neutrino  problem’  using  reactor  anti-neutrinos.  KamLAND  has  been  able  to  measure  the 

4

 

oscillation parameters of electron anti-neutrinos, by comparing the observed event spectrum 

with  that  predicted  in  the  absence  of  oscillation.  In  addition,  KamLAND  was  capable  to 
extract the signal of geo-neutrinos from 238U and 232Th. Due to the different energy spectra, 

events  from  Uranium  and  Thorium  progenies  can  be  separated.  The  best  fit  attributes  4 
events to  238U and 5 to  232Th. According to [1] and [11], this corresponds to about 40 TW 

radiogenic heat generation, values from 0 to 110 TW being  allowed at 95% C.L. 

2.2. The reference model of geo-neutrino production 

 

 

The main sources of heat and antineutrinos in the Earth’s interior are Uranium, Thorium 

and  Potassium.  Through  its  decay  chain,  each  nuclide  releases  energy  together  with  anti-

neutrinos  (Table  1).  From  the  distribution  of  these  elements  in  the  Earth  one  can  thus 

estimate both radiogenic heat flow and the anti-neutrino flow. 

The  argument  of  geo-neutrinos  was  introduced  by  Eder  [12]  in  the  60’s  and  it  was 

extensively reviewed by Krauss et al. [13] in the 1980’s. Raghavan et al. [11] and Rothschild 

et  al.  [14]  remarked  on  the  potential  of  KamLAND  and  Borexino  for  geo-neutrino 

observations. The relevance of geo-neutrinos for determining the radiogenic contribution to 

Earth’s heat flow [15] has been discussed in [3, 16, 17]. 

Recently, a reference model of geo-neutrino fluxes has been presented in [3]. The main 

ingredients  of  this  model  and  its  predictions  for  geo-neutrino  fluxes  and  event  yields  are 

reviewed in the following. Concerning the crust, the 2°x2° model of Ref. [18] was adopted. 

World-averaged  abundances  of  radiogenic  elements  have  been  estimated  separately  for 

oceans,  the  continental  crust  (subdivided  into  upper,  middle  and  lower  sub-layers), 

sediments,  and  oceanic  crust.  Although  this  treatment  looks  rather  detailed  on  the  globe 

scale, the typical linear dimension of each tile is of order 200 km, so that any information on 

a smaller scale is essentially lost. The Preliminary Reference Earth Model [19] was used for 

the  mantle  density  profile,  dividing  Earth’s  interior  into  several  spherically  symmetrical 

shells  corresponding  to  seismic  discontinuities.  Concerning  its  composition,  a  two-layer 

stratified model was used: for present day upper mantle, considered as the source of MORB, 

mass abundances of 6.5 and 17.3 ppb for Uranium and Thorium respectively and 78 ppm for 

Potassium were assumed down to a depth h0 = 670 km. These abundances were obtained by 

averaging the results of Refs. [20] and [21]. Abundances in the lower mantle were inferred 

5

 

by requiring that the BSE constraint is globally satisfied, thus obtaining 13.2 and 52 ppb for 

U and Th respectively, 160 ppm for K.

position, respectively. The produced fluxes at several sites on the globe have been calculated 

within  the  reference  model,  see  [3].  We  concentrate  here  on  a  few  locations  of  specific 

interest: 

(i)  For  the  Kamioka  mine,  where  the  KamLAND  detector  is  in  operation,  the  predicted 
uranium flux is ΦU = 3.7·106 cm-2s-1, the flux from Thorium is comparable and that from 

Potassium is fourfold. Within the reference model, about 3/4 of the flux is generated from 

material in the crust and the rest mainly from the lower mantle. 

(ii) At Gran Sasso laboratory, where Borexino [22] is in preparation, the prediction is ΦU = 
4.2·106  cm-2s-1,  this  larger  flux  arising  from  a  bigger  contribution  of  the  surrounding 

continental crust. Thorium and Potassium fluxes are found to be  correspondingly rescaled. 

(iii) At the top of Himalaya, a place chosen so that the crust contribution is maximal, one has 
ΦU = 6.7·106 cm-2s-1. The crust contribution exceeds 90%. 
(iv) At Hawaii, a site which minimizes the crust contribution, the prediction is ΦU = 1.3·106 
cm-2s-1, originated mainly from the mantle. 

From the produced fluxes,  together with  the knowledge of neutrino propagation (i.e. the 

oscillation  parameters),  the  interaction  cross  section  and  the  size  of  the  detector,  one  can 

compute  the  expected  event  yields.  These  are  shown  over  the  globe  in  Fig.  2  (see 

http://www.neogeo.unisi.it/fabio/index.asp  for  more 

information).  In  summary, 

this 

reference  model has to be intended as a starting point, providing first estimates of expected 

fluxes and events. In view of the present debate about mantle circulation and composition, a 

more  general 

treatment 

is  needed,  which  encompasses  both  geochemically  and 

geophysically  preferred models.

3. Geochemistry, geophysics and geo-neutrinos  

The composition and circulation inside Earth’s mantle is the subject of a strong and so 

far unresolved debate between geochemists and geophysicists. Geochemical evidence has 

been used to support the existence of two compositionally distinct reservoirs in the mantle, 

the  borders  between  them  being  usually  placed  at  a  depth  near  h0  =  670  km,  whereas 

geophysics  presents  evidence  of  mantle  convection  extending  well  beyond  this  depth.  If 

this  convection  involves  the  whole  mantle,  it  would  have  destroyed  any  pre-existing 

layering, in conflict with geochemical evidence.  

More generally, new views on mantle convection models overcome the widely diffused 

model  of  two-layer  mantle  convection,  namely  an  outgassed  and  depleted  upper  layer 

overlying  a  deeper,  relatively  primordial  and  undegassed  mantle  layer.  The  ensemble  of 

geochemical  and  geophysical  evidence  along  with  terrestrial  heat  flow-heat  production 

balance argues against both whole mantle convection and layering at 670 km depth models, 

suggesting the existence of a transition between the two reservoirs (outgassed and depleted 

–  degassed  and  primordial)  at  1600–2000  km  depth  [23,  24,  25].  In  the  numerical 

simulation  of  their  mantle  convection  model,  Kellogg  et  al.  [24]  located  this  boundary  at 

~1600  km  depth  and  calculated  for  the  layers  depleted  and  enriched  in  heat-producing 

elements a U concentration of 7 and 25.6 ppb, respectively. 

 In this section we look at the implications of this debate on the predicted geo-neutrino 

fluxes.  One  can  build  a  wide  class  of  models,  including  the  extreme  geochemical  and 

geophysical models, in terms of just one free parameter, the depth h marking the borders 

between the two hypothetical reservoirs:  

i)  Estimates  of  U  in  depleted  upper  mantle  after  crust  extraction  confine  previously 

proposed values in the range of 2 to 7.1 ppb [26, 27, 28]. Given the uncertainty on these 

values, we assumed in a previous contribution that the uppermost part of the mantle has an 

average value of 6.5 ppb [3]. This value, close to the more recent consensus values of 4-5 

ppb [26, 29] is here assumed, for consistency, to represent Uranium abundance (au) down 

                                                                                                                                               

1 We remark that angle-integrated fluxes are relevant for the non-directional geo-neutrino detection. 

7

 

to an unspecified mantle depth h. As shown below, the assumption of lower U abundance 

for the uppermost depleted mantle has limited effects on geo-neutrino flux predictions.  

ii) Below h we determine abundances (al) by requiring mass balance for the whole Earth. 

This  means  that  Uranium  mass  below  the  critical  depth, m>h, is obtained by subtracting 

from the total BSE estimated mass (mBSE) the quantity observationally determined in the 

crust (mc) and that contained in the mantle above h (m< h ): 

 

m>h = mBSE - mc - m<h 

 

      (2) 

The  abundance  in  the  lower  part  is  then  calculated  as  the  ratio  of  m>  h  to  Earth’s  mass 

 

 

 

below h (M>h ): 

 

 

 

 

al = m> h /M>h  

 

         

       (3) 

 

 

 

 

This class of models, described in Figs. 3 and 4, includes a fully mixed mantle, which 

is obtained for h = 25 km (i.e. just below a mean crust thickness obtained averaging the 

vales  for  continental  and  oceanic  crust)  so  that  the  strongly  impoverished  mantle  has  a 

negligible  thickness.  The  traditional  geochemical  model  corresponds  to  h  =  h0.  As  h 

increases, the depleted region extends deeper inside the Earth and - due to mass balance - 

the innermost part of the mantle becomes richer and closer in composition to the primitive 

mantle. These simplified models imply a uniform composition of the considered mantle 

shells,  against 

the  ample  evidence  of 

large  regional  chemical  and 

isotopic 

heterogeneities.  A  similar  argument  holds  for  the  heterogeneity  in  the  density 

distribution in the Earth’s interior that may also affect neutrino flux [30]. However, the 

choice  of  a  gross  average  of  compositional  and  density  parameters  is  a  reasonable 

approximation  for  a  precise  determination  of  the  geo-neutrino  fluxes,  if  uncertainties 

resulting from the neglected regional fluctuations are further evaluated (see section 5).  

Let us discuss in detail a few cases, remembering that the BSE estimate for Uranium in 
the whole Earth is mBSE = 0.8·1017 kg and that the best estimate for the amount in the crust  
[3] is mc = 0.35·1017 kg  so that Uranium in the mantle is expected to be mm = 0.45·1017 

kg. 

8

 

a) In the fully mixed model, this quantity has to be distributed over the mantle mass Mm = 
4.0·1024  kg,  which  yields  a  uniform  mantle  abundance  a  =  11.25  ppb.  We  shall  refer  to 

this model as MIX. 

one has the REF model [3]. 

b)  If  we  keep  the  estimated abundance in the uppermost part (au = 6.5 ppb) down to  h0 

c) Among all possible models, the case h = 1630 km is particularly interesting. Below this 

depth the resulting Uranium abundance is 20 ppb, corresponding to the BSE estimate. The 

innermost part of the mantle is thus primitive in its trace element composition and the crust 

enrichment  is  obtained  at  expenses  of  the  mantle  content  above h.  We  shall  refer  to  this 

model as PRIM.  

Concerning geo-neutrino fluxes from the mantle, all the models proposed above have 

the  same  amount  of  heat/anti-neutrino  sources  and  only  the  geometrical  distribution  is 

varied. The largest flux corresponds to the model with  sources closest to the surface, i.e. 

to the MIX model. On the other hand, the minimal prediction is obtained when the sources 

are  concentrated at larger depth, which corresponds to the PRIM case. From Table 2, the 

difference between the extreme cases is 8%, model REF being in between.  

The abundance in the upper reservoir au can also be treated as a free parameter. If we 

use  an  extremely  low  value  au  =  2  ppb  [27]  down  to  about  1200  km  and  primitive 
abundance below, we obtain the minimal prediction 0.86·106 cm-2s-1.  

We conclude this section with the following remarks:  

a) Uncertainties on the geometrical distribution of trace elements in the mantle can change 

the REF prediction for the mantle by at most ±8%.  

b)  A  geo-neutrino  detector  at  a  site  where  the  contribution  from  the  mantle  is  dominant 

(i.e. far from the continental crust) can be sensitive to the mantle compositional geometry 

only if measurements can be accurate within to the percent level. 

c) Since at Kamioka mine or at Gran Sasso the mantle contribution to the total flux is about 

one quarter of the total [3], uncertainties on the mantle geometry imply an estimated error 

of about 2% on the total flux predicted with REF. 

  

In our modelling we assumed that the Earth’s core does not contain a significant amount 

of radioactive elements. We are aware that some authors proposed that the core is hosting 

some  radioactive  elements,  and  particularly  K,  in  order  to  offer  an  alterative  explanation 

either for the energy needed to run the Geodynamo or as a way to explain Earth’s volatile 

9

 

elements inventory [31]. However, the proposed models of the core’s energy budget imply 

a  variety  of  assumptions  and  are  vastly  different,  thus  reaching  in  cases  opposite 

conclusions, whereas geochemical evidence is in favour of a general absence of radioactive 

heating in the core. We want to stress here that this point is not crucial for our modelling. 

Comparison  of  predictions  of  geo-neutrino  production  with  experimental  results  at 

Kamioka  is  in  itself  a  way  of  constraining  the  Earth’s  energetics,  revealing  whether  the 

Earth’s  flow  is  mainly  non  radiogenic  or  significant  K  has  to  be  hidden  in  the  Earth’s 

interior.  

 

 

 

4. The Bulk Silicate Earth constraint 

So  far  we  have  been  considering  the  effect  of  different  geometrical  distributions  of 

trace  elements  in  the  mantle,  for  fixed  amounts of  these  elements  within  it.  Actually  the 

BSE  model  can  be  exploited  so  as  to  obtain  tight  constraints  on  the  total  flux  produced 

together from the crust and the mantle. In fact, with BSE fixing the total amount of trace 

elements  inside  Earth,  geometrical  arguments  and  observational  constraints  on  the  crust 

composition  can  be  used  in  order  to  find  extreme  values  of  the  produced    fluxes.  As  an 

extension of the previous section, the maximal (minimal) flux is obtained by placing the 

sources as close (far) as possible to Earth’s surface, where the detector is located.  

As mentioned in the introduction, the range of BSE Uranium concentrations reported 

in the literature is between 18 and 23 ppb, corresponding to a total Uranium mass between 
m(min)=0.72  and  m(max)=0.92  in  units  of  1017  kg.  In  the  same  units,  we  estimate  that 

Uranium  mass  in  the  crust  is  between  mc(min)=0.30  and  mc(max)=0.41,  by  taking  the 

lowest (highest) concentration reported in the literature for each layer, see Table 2 of [3]. 

The main source of uncertainty is from the abundance in the lower crust, estimated at 0.20 

ppm  in  Ref.  [32]  and  at  1.1  ppm  in  Ref.  [33].  Estimates  for  the  abundance  in  the  upper 

crust  are  more  concordant,  ranging  from  2.2  ppm  [4]  to  2.8  ppm  [34].  We  remark  that, 

within this approach, the resulting average crustal Uranium abundance acc is in the range 

1.3-1.8  ppm,  which  encompasses  all  estimates  reported  in the  literature  [32,  33,  35,  36] 

but for that of Ref. [4], acc=0.9 ppm (Table 2).  

10

 

The  highest  flux  is  obtained  by  assuming  the  maximal  mass  in  the  crust  and  the 

maximal allowed  mass in the mantle, m(max)-mc(max)=0.51, with a uniform distribution 

inside  the  mantle,  corresponding  to  a=12.8  ppb.  On  the  other  hand,  the  lowest  flux 

corresponds to the minimal mass in the crust and the minimal mass in the mantle, m(min)-

mc(min)=0.42,  with  a  distribution  in  the  mantle  similar  to  that  of  PRIM,  i.e.  a  strongly 

depleted  mantle  with  au=2  ppb  down  to  about  1300  km  and  a  primordial  composition 

beneath. 

The predicted  fluxes are shown in Table 4 for a few locations of particular interest: the 

Kamioka mine (33° N 85° E) where KamLAND is operational, the Gran Sasso laboratory 

(42° N 14° E) where BOREXINO [22] is in preparation, the top of Himalaya (36.N 137. 

E), which receives the maximal contribution from the crust, and Hawaii (20° N 156° E), a 

location where the mantle contribution is dominant. At any site the difference between the

5.  The effects of local structures  

The  main  result  of  the  previous  section  is  that  -  neglecting  regional  fluctuations  - 

global mass balance provides a precise determination of the geo-neutrino  fluxes. We shall 

compare  this  precision  with  uncertainties  resulting  from  fluctuations  of  the  regional 

geochemical composition. 

11

 

 

 

  

 

Indeed the Uranium concentration in the region where the detector is located may be 

different from the world average and local fluctuations of this highly mobile element are to 

be envisaged. These variations, although negligible for mass balance, can affect the  flux 

significantly. In other words, geometrical arguments fix the contribution of distant sources 

and  a  more  detailed  geological  and  geochemical  investigation  of  the  region  around  the 

detector is needed, the error quoted in Eq. (5) providing a benchmark for the accuracy of 

the local evaluation. In this respect, let us consider a few examples of practical interest. 

5.1. The contribution from the crust near KamLAND 

It has been estimated that about one half of the geo-neutrino signal is generated within 

a distance of 500 km from Kamioka, essentially in the Japanese continental shelf. In REF 

the  world  averaged  upper  crust  Uranium  concentration, 

52=

,    was  adopted  for 

auc

Japan. In a recent study of the chemical composition of Japan upper crust [37] more than 

hundred  samples,  corresponding  to  37  geological  groups,  have  been  analyzed.  The 

composition  is  weighted  with  the  frequency  in  the  geological  map  and  the  resulting 

average  abundance  is 

a Jap

.
322=

ppm

,  which  implies  a  7.2%  reduction of the flux from 

Japanese upper crust with respect to that estimated  in REF. Larger variations occur when 

rocks  are  divided  according  to  age  or  type,  see  Table  5,  and  even  larger  differences  are 

found within each group. All this calls for a detailed geochemical and geophysical study, 

with the goal of reducing the effect of regional fluctuations to the level of the uncertainty 

from global geochemical constraints. 

5.2. The subducting slab below the Japan Arc 

As well known, below the Japan islands arc there is a subducting slab originating from 

the  Philippine  and  Pacific  plates.  Let  us  compare  the  amount  of  Uranium  carried  by  this 

plate with that contained in the continental crust of the Japan arc.  

Roughly, the Japan crust  can be described as a rectangle with area A=L1·L2 ≈ 1800·250 
km2  =  4.5.105  km2  (Fig.  5).  Conrad  depth  is  on  the  average  at  h1=18km  and  Moho 
discontinuity  at  h2=36  km  [38].  We  assume  uniform  density ρ=2.7  ton/m3.    Concerning 

Uranium  abundance  we  take  for  the  upper  crust    auc=2.3  ppm  from  [37].    For  the  lower 

12

 

crust  we  take  alc=  0.6  ppm,  an  average  between  largely  different  estimates.  The  resulting 

uranium masses, mi=A h ρ ai,  are reported in Table 6. 

The  Philippine  plate  is  moving  towards  the  Eurasia  plate  at  about  40  mm/yr  and  is 

subducting beneath the southern part of Japan. The Pacific Plate is moving in roughly the 

same direction at about 80 mm/yr and is subducting beneath the northern half of Japan. The 

slab  is  penetrating  below  Japan  with  an  angle  α≈6°  with  respect  to  the  horizontal.  This 
process  has  been  occurring  on  a  time  scale  T≈108  y.  Along  this  time  the  slab  front  has 

advanced by D=vT≈6000 km for v=60 mm/yr, the average of the two plates, see Fig. 6. We 
assume  that  the  slab  brings  with  it  oceanic  crust,  with  density ρoc=3  Ton/m3    for  a  depth 

h3≈10 km, the Uranium abundance being typical of an oceanic crust, aoc=0.1 ppm. 

If  we  assume  that  the  slab  keeps  its  trace  elements  while  subducting,  we  have  just  to 

estimate the amount of Uranium which is contained in the subducting crust below Japan. Its 

area A’ below is slightly larger than  that of Japan arc, A’ = A cosα ≈ A. For the assumed 
values of density and depth the mass of the slab is Mslab = 1.35 1019 kg. The Uranium mass 
in the subducting crust is thus mslab= 1.3 1012 kg, a negligible amount as it is about 1/40 of 

that in the continental crust of Japan. 

On  the  other  hand,  it  is  possible  that  the  slab  loses  Uranium  while  subducting.  As  an 

extreme case, we assume that all Uranium from the subducting crust is dissolved in fluids 

during dehydration reactions and accumulates in the lower part of the continental crust of 

Japan,  enriching  it.  Since  Japan  has  been  exposed  to  a  slab  of  length  D  ≈  6000  km,  the 
maximal accumulated Uranium mass is macc=3.2 1013kg.  This corresponds to an increase of 

the Uranium abundance in the Japanese lower continental crust, which becomes alc=2 ppm 

instead  of  the  previously  assumed  0.6  ppm.  The  prediction  of  the  produced    flux  at 
Kamioka  changes  from  3.7    to  4.0  106  cm-2  s-1.  We  remark  that  this  8%  effect  has  been 

derived assuming the extreme hypothesis of a complete release. 

 

 

5.3. Plumes 

So  far  we  have  been  considering  the  mantle  as  a  spherically  symmetrical  system, 

whereas, as well known, there are significant inhomogeneities. As an extreme case, let us 

consider the effect of a plume emerging from the mantle on the vertical of the detector. 

Clearly  what  matters  is  the  contrast  between  the  plume  and  the  average  mantle, i.e.  the 

13

 

result  essentially  depends  on  the  difference  between  the  Uranium  abundances  in  the 

plume and that in the mantle. For simplicity we  assume the detector to be on the top of a 

cylindrical plume with radius rp, extending down to a depth hp with uniform density ρ and 

Uranium abundance ap. The contribution to the geo-neutrino flux from the plume at the 

detector position r is given by

radius r

p and activity Ap satisfy:

Since  activity  is  essentially  proportional  to  the  element  abundance,  a  similar  equation

in the mantle (am≈ 11.25 ppb):

For rp ≈ 350 km, this means ap   ≈  20 am, in other words if the Uranium abundance in a 

plume  is  20  times  larger  than  the  average  Uranium  abundance  in  the  mantle,  then  the 

14

 

plume contribution is comparable to that of the whole mantle. This corresponds to a value 

exceeding  200  ppb,  that  is  clearly  unrealistic.  On  the  other  hand,  estimates  of  U 

abundance in the mantle source of plume-derived OIB magmas with either HIMU or EM 

isotopic signatures (see [39] and references therein) may be roughly in the order of 30 up 

to  50  ppb  assuming  a  bulk  partition  coefficient  of  0.002-0.004  for  a  garnet  peridotite 

assemblage and a nominal melt fraction of 0.01. The U-neutrino flux from  a plume with 

such U abundance  is about 20-25% of that from  the whole mantle, and thus it might be

however, this could provide an independent way of assessing the existence of plumes, and 

possibly  a measurement of  their uranium abundances.

5.  Concluding remarks 

We summarize here the main points of this paper:  

1) Uncertainties on the geometrical distribution of trace elements in the mantle (for a fixed 

mass within it) can change the prediction of the reference model [3] for the geo-neutrino 

flux  from  mantle  by  at  most 

%8±

  (full  range),  the  extreme  values  corresponding  to  a 

fully-mixed and to a two-layer model, with primordial abundance below about 1300 km.  

2)  By  using  global  mass  balance  for  the  Bulk  Silicate  Earth,  the  predicted    flux 

contribution originating from distant sources in the crust and in the mantle is fixed within 

%5±

)σ1
  (

 with respect to the reference model.  

3) A detailed geological and geochemical investigation of the region within few hundreds 

km  from  the  detector  has  to  be  performed,  for  reducing  the  flux  uncertainty  from 

fluctuations of the local abundances to the level of the global geochemical error.  

4) A five-kton detector operating over four years at a site relatively far from nuclear power 

plants  can  measure  the  geo-neutrino  signal  with  5%  accuracy.  Such  a  detector  is  a  few 

times larger than that already operational at Kamioka. 

This  will  provide  a  crucial  test  of  the  Bulk  Silicate  Earth  and  a  direct  estimate  of  the 

radiogenic contribution to terrestrial heat. If experiments at Kamioka furnish results close to 

the  predicted  minimum  values  for  U  and  Th,  then  these  elements  provide  a  minor 

contribution to the earth’s energetics; this in turn implies that either Earth’s flow is mainly 

non  radiogenic  or  significant  K  has  to  be  hidden  in  the  Earth’s  interior.  Alternatively,  if 

experimental results approach the predicted maximum values for U and Th, the Earth’s heat 

flow will be confirmed to derive from the radiogenic contribution.

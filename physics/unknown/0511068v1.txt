High  radiation  hardness,  chemical  resistance,  high  temperature  operation  capabilities  stimulate  a  growing 
interest  to  use  diamond  materials  as  detectors  of  ionizing  radiation.  Samples  of  CVD-diamond  materials  in  sizes 
4 3 mm and 4 1 mm with thickness from 50 microns up to 500 microns have been grown in INR RAS using a DC 
glow discharge in a mixture of gases CH4/H2 on molybdenum substrates.

1. INTRODUCTION  

A number of unique properties of diamond such as 
extremely  high  radiation  hardness,  chemical  resistance 
against  all  chemicals,  absolute  non-toxicity  call  for  an 
increasing interest to use diamond materials as detectors 
of  ionizing  radiation  operating  in  hostile  environments 
or  in  conditions,  imposing  special  requirements  to 
stability  of  measurement  of  a  doze,  for  example  in 
medical  installations  for  radiotherapy.  Moreover,  the 
atomic  number  of  diamond  Z  =  6  that  is  close  to  the 
effective atomic number of a soft tissue Z = 7.4, so the 
diamond  is  a  nearly  tissue  equivalent,  that  allows  to 
avoid  energy  dependent  corrections  of  the  detector 
signal. 
Initially,  natural  diamonds  with  suitable 
electronic  properties  were  used  in  radiation  detection 
[1].  The  main  disadvantage  of  the  natural  diamond 
detectors is a high cost due to extremely rare detector-
grade  natural  diamond  (Type  IIa),  which  limits  the 
availability of these detectors and moreover, electronic 
properties  of  diamond  stones  within  the  Type  IIa 
category can vary strongly. Therefore, the production of 
sufficiently  cheap  diamond  plates  with  sizes  at  least  4 
mm and thickness 50  500  m with sufficient quality to 
build the detector is rather urgent problem. 

The promising technology for synthesis of diamond 
materials  is  the  Chemical  Vapour  Deposition  (CVD) 
technology,  which  allows  to  grow  diamond  material 
plates  in  controllable  vacuum  with  specified  thickness 
and  sizes,  which  are  determined  by  sizes  of  substrates 
and  duration  of  the  process.  However,  the  CVD-
diamond has a polycrystalline structure with crystallites 
sizes  about  10-20 %  of  thickness  of  grown  plates,  and 
crystallites bounders could act as the traps and decrease 
the charge collection efficiency [2,3].  

grooves  0.5 mm  in  depth  into  sites  4 1 mm2  or 
4 3 mm2,  which  simultaneously  are  the  substrates  for 
growth  of  diamond  plates.  The  conditions  of  synthesis 
(gas pressure, power density in the discharge) are fitted 
in  such  a  manner,  that  the  growth  of  diamond  takes 
place only on a surface of substrates.

PLATES SYNTHESIS  

We have developed a CVD apparatus based on DC 
glow discharge for manufacture of cost effective CVD-
diamond plates. This apparatus is schematically shown 
in  Fig.1.  In  the  reaction  chamber  glow  discharge  is 
sustained  in  a  mixture  of  gases  CH4  and  H2  between 
molybdenum 
and 
molybdenum  anode  11  mm  diameter.  The  cathode  is 
mounted  on  the  copper  water-cooled  holder.  The  front 
surface  of  the  anode  is  polished  and  segmented  by 

25  mm 

diameter 

cathode 

It is well known that glow discharge with a current 
close to a critical one has a considerable probability to 
transform into an arc discharge with drastic contraction 
of  a  discharge  channel,  which  could  result  in  damages 
of growing material. To decrease a probability of these 
transitions, similarly to [4], the pulse operating mode of 
the discharge is used. The duration of pulses and pauses 
of  a  discharge  current  is  set  by  a  transistor  modulator 
TK.  The  resistor  connected  in  parallel  to  TK  is 
important  as  it  provides  decreasing  of  a  current  in  a 

  
 
 
 
 
 
   

pause  not  to  zero,  but  up  to  a  magnitude  ~0.15Inom, 
which  facilitates  the  subsequent  transition  to  the  rated 
current and rises stability of operation. Furthermore the 
transistor  modulator  TK  provides  fast  (~  10  s) 
switching-off  a  discharge  current  source  in  case  the 
discharge  starts  to  transform  into  an  arc  mode  and  a 
current  exceeds  a  preset  value.  The  additional  power 
supply with a constant voltage of 6 kV is connected to 
the  discharge  gap  in  series  with  1 MOhm  resistor  for 
providing  a  discharge  ignition  in  case  of  accidental 
extinction.  

Synthesis  of  CVD-diamond  plates  was  carried  out 
under  the  following  conditions  in  reaction  chamber: 
typical  gas  mixture 
2.5%CH4  in  H2,  gas  pressure 
300 Torr,  discharge  voltage  540 V,  discharge  current 
1.7 A, current duty factor 95%.  

Oscillogram  of  discharge  current  is  shown  on 
Fig.2.  Material  growth  rate  in  these  conditions  was 
around 12  15  m/hour.

3. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE 

GROWN MATERIAL 

In  deposition  runs  lasted  from  3  to  35  hours 
CVD-diamond  plates  with  the  sizes  4 1 mm2  and 
4 3 mm2  and  the thickness from 50  to  500  m have
been  grown.  After  deposition  and  cooling  down  the 
CVD-diamond plates can be easily detached from the 
substrates  due  to  different  thermal  expansion  of 
diamond and molybdenum. The grown material has a 
polycrystalline  structure  with  a  clearly  visible  in  the 
cracked  samples  crystallites  of  columnar  shape 
elongated  along  the  growth  direction.  The  facets  of 
about 0.1 
 0.2 plate thickness can be observed on the 
crystallites at a growth side of the plate. Fig.3 shows 
the image of growth side of plate with thickness 100 
m  (scanning  electron  microscope).  Fig.4  shows  the 
spectra  of  Raman  scattering  analysis,  which  was 
performed  with  argon  laser  on  the  wavelength 
=514 nm,  narrow  diamond  peak  at  1333 cm-1  is 

clear visible. 

X-ray diffraction analysis of the plates was made 
using  the  diffractometer  DRON-3  with  CuK 1  line 
with 
= 0.154057  nm.  Fig.5  shows  a  XRD  pattern 
measured at the growth side of 500  m plate.

4. CVD-DIAMOND DETECTION 

PERFORMANCE 

The surface  morphology of plates from a growth 
side and from a substrate side is essentially different. 
Whereas  on  the  growth  side  the  typical  sizes  of 
crystallites  make  up  tens  of micron, on  the substrate 
side  these  sizes  do  not  exceed  a  micron.  The 
numerous defects on crystallites borders can serve as

In  order  to  decrease  an  influence  of  these  traps 
the coplanar type detecting device [5] was made with 
both  electrodes  located  on  the  growth  side  of  the 
plate. The distance between  the electrodes makes up 
200  micron.  For  measurement  of  efficiency  of 
collection  of  the  charges  induced  by  incident  alpha-

 
 
     
   

particles,  the  installation  schematically  represented 
on Fig.6 has been assembled.

The estimated range of this particles in a diamond is 
~ 13  m. The total charge Qind, induced by  -particle 
in  a  diamond  Qind  =  eE / ,  where 
=  13 eV  is  the 
energy  of  electron-hole  creation  in  diamond.  The

followed  by  a  shaping  amplifier 
preamplifier 
(Schlumberger  Type  7129) 
and  multichannel 
analyzer  (Norland  5300).  Pulse  height  specters  were 
measured  as  differences  of  counts  with  and  without 
-source  for  exception  of  electronic  noise  of  a 
system.  Pulse  height  spectra  for  a  bias  voltage  of 
40 V  is  shown  on  Fig.7.  The  charge  collection 
efficiency  was  estimated  as  a  ratio  of  collected  and 
induced charges and comes to around 1%.  

5. CONCLUSION  

Our  measurements  have  demonstrated 
that 
relatively  cheap  CVD  diamond,  produced  by  glow 
is  suitable  for  detecting  of  charged 
discharge, 
particles.  The  next  tack  which  will  be  studied  is  the 
stability  of  such  diamond  detector  against  neutron 
and  particle  irradiation  which  can  be  done  at  the 
RADEX 
INR  RAS.  Further 
investigations  of  radiation  hardness  and  stability 
should  be  made  in  the  radiological  center  of  INR 
RAS  on  the  beams  of  200 MeV  protons  and  6 MeV 
photons.  It  is  believed,  that  CVD  diamond  based 
charge particle detectors will continue the sucsessful 
sequence of particle detectors developed up today in 
INR RAS [10-13].

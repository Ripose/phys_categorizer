Abstract. We show that when the observers are located in a plane electromagnetic wave 
it isn’t compulsory for them to take into account the time dilation and length contraction 
effects when the wave is detected from two inertial reference frames in relative motion. 
We  also  illustrate  the  difference  between  the  approach  that  uses  Einstein  type  of 
observers  confronted  with  time  dilation  and  length  contraction  effects  and  an 
unconventional approach that uses observers detecting information from the energy that 
arrives at their location. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Margaritondo1  presents  a  different  way  to  introduce  the  concept  of 
 
event  and  to  derive  the  transformation  equations  for  its  energy.  The  basic 
idea  considers  a  predetermined  volume  located  inside  a  plane  and  linearly 
polarized  electromagnetic  wave.  This  volume  includes  a  given  number  of 
photons and a given energy.

Figure 1. Scenario for deriving  the  transformation  equation for  the  energy of  a 
photon.  Figure  1a  depicts  the  situation  detected  from  the  rest  frame  of  the 
photomultiplier  whereas  Figure  1b  illustrates  the  situation  detected  from  a  reference 
frame which approaches the first one. 
 
In  order  to  make  the  problem  transparent  we  considered  the  scenario 
presented  in  Figure  1,  involving  the  mentioned  electromagnetic  wave 
propagating in empty space, incident on a photomultiplier (PM) whose ticks 
account  for  the  incidence  rate  of  photons.2  First  we  consider  the  problem

from the rest frame of the photomultiplier (K) and second from a reference 
frame  K'  being  in  the  standard  arrangement,  with  frame  K  moving  with 
constant  velocity  –V  in  the  negative  direction  of  the  overlapped  axes 
OX(O’X’). We consider the situation when the front of the electromagnetic 
wave arrives at the sensitive surface of the photomultiplier and so the wave 
interaction  with  the  photomultiplier  can  be  neglected.  The  wave  energy 
stored into the photomultiplier is characterized by the energy density - ρ in K 
and ρ' in K' related in the case of this scenario by3

and so the energy W incident on the photomultiplier during a time interval ∆t 
(proper time interval) can be expressed as

which  the  wave  propagates.  The  dimensions  defining  the  surface  A  are 
relativistic invariant being perpendicular to  the direction  of  relative  motion 
and therefore A is also relativistic invariant.

electromagnetic wave 
Blatter and Greber4 make a net distinction between the Einstein type 
 
of observers, which are equipped with meter sticks and synchronized clocks 
and are confronted with the time dilation and length contraction effects, and 
the  observers  collecting  information  about  the  events  by  using  the  light 
signals  arriving  at  their  location  (photographic  detection)  or  light  signals 
they emit and receive back (radar detection). As we see, the scenario that we 
presented above mixes up physical quantities measured by the two types of 
observers. Besides, equations (5) and (6) are not in accordance with the first 
relativistic postulate that requires that the laws of physics should be the same 
in all inertial reference frames in relative motion and so should be the speed 
of  light  in  empty  space.  We  consider  now  that  the  observers  of  the  two 
frames  are  entirely  immersed  in  the electromagnetic  wave.  Observers  from 
K separate a given volume O = c⋅A∆t in which the energy W is stored and 
express the incident energy on the photomultiplier as

The  electromagnetic  wave  offers  its  wavelength  (λ  and  λ’)  as  a  particular 
unit to express the lengths along the OX and O'X' axes and the period of the 
electromagnetic  oscillations  (  ∆t=T,  ∆t'=T'  )  as  another  particular  unit  to 
express the time intervals. Further we also express the volumes as Aλ and Aλ' 
in  K  and  in  K'  respectively.  Taking  into  account  the  invariance  of  the 
counted number of photons we obtain from (9)

3. Conclusions 
 
 
 Two  approaches  to  the  same  scenario  show  the  difference  between 
the  ways  in  which  the  two  types  of  relativistic  observers  solve  the  same 
problem.  The  moral  is  that  when  working  in  the  electromagnetic  wave  we 
shouldn’t  mix  physical  quantities  measured  by  different  kind  of  observers. 
We  avoid  the  time  dilation  and  length  contraction  effects  by  employing 
relativistic observers of second type and forcing them to use the wavelength 
and the wave period as length unit and respectively time unit instead of the 
meter  stick  and  synchronized  clock  units  as  usual  for  the  Einstein  type  of 
relativistic observers.

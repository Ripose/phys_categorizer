ABSTRACT

Several  basic  properties  of  homogeneous  planar  Whispering  Gallery
dielectric  resonators  are  investigated  through  a  general  approach.  In
particular  the  values  for  the  minimum  and  maximum  allowed  radius,
defined  by  irradiation  and  dielectric  losses,  respectively,  are  obtained  in
terms of the complex dielectric constant of the involved media. The same
approach is employed in the analysis of the limit allowed frequencies of a
fixed  family  of  mode,  leading  to  the  definition  of  the  “ideal”  frequency
band.  The  role  of  the  transverse  mode  is  then  discussed,  and  the
“effective”  frequency  band  is  introduced  and  determined  both  in  simple
disc  and  circular  ring  resonators.  The  extension  of  the  effective  band  is
limited  at  least  by  a  factor  3,  in  terms  of  decades,  in  comparison  to  the
extension  of  the  ideal  one;  this  limitation,  due  to  the  presence  of
transverse  modes,  can  be  overcome  using  suitably  designed  non-
homogeneous resonators, as discussed in a following companion paper.

1.  Introduction

Planar  Dielectric  Resonators  working  on  Whispering  Gallery  Modes
(WGDR), starting from their recent discover  [1], have assumed a role of
increasing  importance  for  applications  in  the  frequency  region  ranging
from microwaves to visible radiation [2-5].

A  huge  quantity  of  papers  have  been  devoted  to  the  study  of  the
distribution  of  electromagnetic  fields  in  these  devices  or  to  their
application  in  different  fields  of  physics  and  technology  (optoelectronic
or  millimetric  devices,  metrology,  apparatus  for  spectroscopy).  In  all
these  applications  the  most  appealing  properties  are  the  manufacture
simplicity, the high merit factor Q and the intrinsic wide working spectral
range.  The  counterpart  of  these  abilities  is  that,  when  quantitative  or
precise  measurements  are  requested  in  different  applications,  a  proper
modeling of the electromagnetic field distribution becomes mandatory.

The  electromagnetic  modeling  of  WGDRs  is  typically  more  difficult
in  comparison  to  the  modeling  of  a  metallic  resonator;  indeed,  the
support  of  the  electromagnetic  field  in  an  open  dielectric  resonator  is
necessarily unbounded and the irradiation losses always differ from zero
[6].  As  a  consequence,  the  numerical  techniques  necessary  for  an
accurate  modeling  should  be  developed  in  the  complex  field  using
functions defined on unbounded support [7].

Owing to the importance for present and future applications, the focus
of  this  paper  is  the  study  of  the  actual  frequency  bandwidth  of  planar
cylindrical  WG  dielectric  resonators.  Through  a  simple  even  if  general
approach,  some  limiting  properties  of  a  WGDR  are  first  investigated.
Starting  from  the  limit  radii  and  modal  indices,  the  working  frequency
band of a WGDR for a fixed family of resonant modes  [8] is calculated;
the  obtained  band,  called  ideal  frequency  band,  only  depends  on  the
complex  dielectric  constants  of  the  involved  materials.  When  however
the  concurrent  presence  of  other  resonant  modes  is  properly  taken  into
account, a reduced operating bandwidth, called effective frequency band,
is  obtained.  The  developed  analytical  procedure  gives  the  connection
between  the  ideal  and  the  effective  operating  bandwidth;  it  is  indeed
demonstrated  that  the  envelope  of  all  the  effective  frequency  bands
obtained  varying  the  dimensions  of  the  resonator  corresponds  to  a
“parent”  frequency  band  coinciding  with  the  ideal  one.  Although  the
extension  of  the  ideal  band  could  span  a  width  of  several  decades,  the
extension of the effective frequency band for a given WGDR is at least  k
times narrower (in terms of decades), being k the dimension of the space
generated  by  the  modal  indices.  The  used  procedure  and  approximations
carried  out  tend  to  privilege  the  possibility  of  grasping  the  physical

                                                                                                                                                               G. Annino et al.

meaning  and  obtaining  simple  and  direct  expressions,  rather  than  of
deducing a very accurate formulation, being explored by this way all the
fundamental  aspects.  More  accurate  calculations  can  be  however
obtained with a suitable numerical modeling.

The  plan  of  the  paper  is  the  following.  Sect.  2  presents  the  general
aspects  of  the  propagation  of  electromagnetic  waves  in  dielectric
cylindrical  structures,  showing  some  peculiarities  of  whispering  gallery
resonators.  In  particular,  the  analysis  of  their  irradiation  and  dielectric
losses  leads  to  the  calculation  of  the  minimum  and  maximum  allowed
values of the azimuthal modal index. Sect. 3 is devoted to the calculation
of  the  ideal  frequency  band  of  a  WGDR,  connected  to  the  limit  values
calculated in the previous section. Sect. 4 shows that the presence of the
transverse  modes  in  the  WGDR  affects  the  ideal  bandwidth  of  the
resonator  leading  to  a  reduced  effective  bandwidth,  first  calculated  for
the case of a disk resonator. The obtained results are then generalized to
the  case  of  an  annular  resonator  with  arbitrary  dimensions.  It  is  then
discussed  the  behavior  of  extension  and  position  of  the  effective
frequency  band  inside  the  ideal  one  in  terms  of  the  geometrical  factor.
Final remarks and outlooks for applications are discussed in Sect. 5.

The developed analysis gives the necessary background which prelude
to  the  prediction  and  the  experimental  verification  of  multiple-band
composite WGDRs, which will be presented in a companion paper.

2.  A general approach
In  its  simpler  form  a  planar  WGDR  is  a  circular  disc  made  with  low
loss  dielectric  isotropic  material  having  a  diameter  much  greater  than  its
thickness, in which the confinement of the radiation is based on the total
internal  reflection  mechanism  [8,9].  WGDRs  support  two  different
families  of  resonant  hybrid  modes,  usually  denoted  WGEn,m,l  and
WGHn,m,l; the first ones are quasi-TE modes, with the electric field lying
approximately  in  the  plane  of  the  resonator,  while  the  second  ones  are
quasi-TM  modes,  with  the  magnetic  field  lying  approximately  in  the
plane  of  the  resonator.  The  three  modal  indices  n,  m  and  l  have  the
following meanings:  n,  the  azimuthal  index,  is  equal  to  the  number  of
wavelengths in a whole turn around the resonator;  m,  the  radial  index,  is
equal  to  the  number  of  nodes  of  the  energy  flux  along  the  radius  of  the
resonator, excluded that one in its center; l, the axial index, is equal to the
number  of  nodes  of  the  energy  flux  along  the  axis  of  the  resonator.  An
approximate  analytical  description  of  the  resonant  modes  can  be  found
elsewhere  [9,10];  according  to  this  approach  the  behavior  of  the

                                                                                                                                                               G. Annino et al.

and  magnetic  permittivities  of  the  material  forming  the  resonator.  In  the
following the magnetic permittivities will be assumed equal to  1. All the
properties  of  planar  WGDRs  investigated  will  be  deduced  starting  from
the  above  field  description;  this  is  equivalent  to  the  assumption  that  the
field  distribution  of  WG  modes  in  planar  WGDRs  can  be  obtained  by
WG  modes  of  a  related  infinite  waveguide,  suitably  choosing  the  axial
propagation  constant  as  pointed  out  in  [8,  9].  As  in  the  case  of  WG
modes of an infinite circular dielectric waveguide  [11],  special  attention
will  be  paid  to  the  case  of  weak  axial  propagation  constants  (h<<k):  a
basic role will then be assigned to the modal index  n.

The rephasing condition gives for the index  n the relation [8]
         n = brm

(3),
where r m is the radius of the so-called modal caustic, defined essentially
as  the  cylindrical  surface  inside  the  resonator  beyond  which  the
electromagnetic  field  is  confined.  In  terms  of  the  geometrical  optics
representation the modal caustic corresponds to the envelope of the rays
of the considered resonant mode.

The  search  for  the  operating  bandwidth  of  a  WGDR  must  firstly
investigate  into  the  realm  of  allowed  values  of  the  azimuthal  index  n.
According to an application oriented operating approach, a definite value
of n can be considered allowed when the corresponding field distribution
presents  losses  weak  enough  to  have  a  resolved  spectrum  and  then  a
“true”  resonant  behavior.  The  main  channels  of  losses  for  a  dielectric
resonator  are  given  by  the  irradiation  losses  and  the  dielectric  losses  of
involved materials. As already stated, the confinement of the radiation in
a WGDR is based on the total internal reflection mechanism; by this way
the  irradiation  losses,  although  always  different  from  zero  [6],  can  be
reduced  to  a  negligible  level  with  a  suitable  design  of  the  resonator.  To

                                                                                                                                                               G. Annino et al.

this  aim  the  geometrical  dimensions  and  the  regularity  of  the  surfaces
play a fundamental role. The total reflection can be obtained on the plane
surfaces of the resonator essentially when the optical thickness of the disc
is  equal  or  greater  than  the  wavelength  in  the  medium  [8].  The
confinement near the curved surface of the disc can be usefully discussed
in  terms  of  the  proper  caustic  r p  which  corresponds,  in  terms  of  the
geometrical  optics  representation,  to  the  envelope  of  the  rays  which
incide  at  the  limit  angle  on  the  curved  surface  of  the  resonator.  The
proper caustic is given by  [12]

e
e

where  eint and  eext  are  the  real  parts  of  the  dielectric  constant  of  the
medium forming and surrounding the resonator, respectively, and  r is the
radius of the resonator.

Since  an  effective  confinement  near  the  curved  surface  of  the  disc  is
obtained when the angle of incidence of the rays on this surface is greater
than the limit angle, the caustics must satisfy the following condition

(5);
r > r m > r p 
in  particular  the  radial  irradiation  losses  decrease  when  the  ratio  r m/r p
increases  [8,13].  The  limit  condition  for  an  effective  radial  field
confinement  is  obtained  when  r m=r p.  Correspondingly  the  minimum
value for the modal caustic is given by:

as a consequence the minimum value  nmin  of  the  azimuthal  index,  fixed
by the irradiation losses, is equal to (Eq. 3)

On the other hand, a maximum value is imposed to the modal caustic
of  the  resonator  and  therefore  to  the  azimuthal  index  by  the  energy
dissipation  due  to  dielectric  losses,  according  to  the  criterion  above
discussed.  The  search  of  these  values  can  be  developed  by  introducing
the absorption coefficient a
 for the intensity of the e.m. radiation; in the
case  of  free  propagation  in  an  infinite  homogeneous  medium  this
coefficient is given by [14]

                                                                                                                                                               G. Annino et al.

where l and v are  the wavelength and the phase velocity of the radiation

an effective wavelength  l  as a function of the spatial coordinates can be

the circular propagation in the plane of the resonator, where the condition
of  positive  interference  must  be  fulfilled  (Eq.  3).  Analogously  to  the

propagation in an infinite medium, where

wavelength  of  the  radiation  measured  along  the  modal  caustic  of  the
resonator. Since the planes of constant phase are radial planes (Eq. 1), in
order to satisfy the conditions of positive interference for any curvilinear
coordinate  rj,  the  above  concept  can  be  generalized  by  defining  an
 which is everywhere proportional to r. As a

The  damping  of  the  electromagnetic  wave  can  be  completely  described
by  Eq.  10,  under  the  approximations  of  weak  axial  propagation  and  of

negligible  the  dielectric  losses  due  to  the  medium  external  to  the

and results independent of  r.  This  circumstance  allows  to  develop  the
following analysis in terms of r m only.

In  order  to  obtain  a  resolved  resonance  spectrum  it  is  necessary  that
the wave resulting from the infinite round trips along the resonator gives
an  effective  interference  effect  with  the  input  wave.  As  a  definition  of
resolved spectrum, the Rayleigh criterion is assumed  [15].  Accordingly,
the normalized wave amplitude  A  resulting  from  all  the  round  trips  can

assume the minimum value  Amin  given  by  

81.0

,  which

corresponds to  Amin=0.05263.  The  fulfillment  of  the  Rayleigh  criterion
guarantees  that  two  consecutive  resonances  of  the  same  family  (fixed
transverse modal indices 

l,m , consecutive indices n) are resolved.

The amplitude A is related to the amplitude As by the relation

.  The  self-consistency  of  the  procedure  is  confirmed

since  the  result  reported  in  Eq.  13,  based  on  the  assumption  of  the
Rayleigh criterion, corresponds here to the assumption of unitary finesse
which, in turn, is another effective way to define a resolved spectrum.

Eqs.  6,  7  and  Eqs.  12,  13  give  the  limit  conditions  connected  to  the
irradiation  losses  (lower  bound)  and  to  dielectric  losses  (upper  bound),
respectively. The allowed values of  n belong to the interval  (nmin, nmax);
the value  nmax  can  be  reached  if  in  this  limit  the  irradiation  losses  are
negligible  in  comparison  to  the  dielectric  ones,  whereas  on  the  contrary
the value  nmin  can  be  reached  when  in  this  limit  the  dielectric  losses  are
negligible in comparison to the irradiation ones. A numerical analysis of
the behavior of both the irradiation and dielectric losses as a function of n
can be found in Ref. [16].

3.  Ideal frequency band of a WGDR

The  limits  in  the  operation  of  a  WGDR  discussed  in  Sect.  2  are
obtained  in  a  general  way;  however  the  dependence  of  these  limits  on
direct  physical  quantities  like  as  the  resonance  frequency  w  and  the
transverse modal indices  m and  l  does  not  appear  explicitly  and  can  be
inferred only in Eqs 7 and 12, owing to the presence of the propagation
constant  b .  In  the  following  some  approximations  will  be  taken  into
account  in  order  to  achieve  directly  significant  expressions  for  the
obtained results. The ideal frequency bandwidth for a WGDR with given
size  will  then  be  obtained  by  considering  the  fundamental  modes  only;
the  effects  of  transverse  modes  with  modal  indexes  m,  l  different  from
zero will be discussed in the next section.

First  of  all,  the  modal  caustic  can  be  conveniently  expressed  as

condition nmax > nmin, are now only related to the dielectric properties of
the  involved  materials.  In  addition,  it  is  worthwhile  to  note  that  it  is
always  possible  to  realize  an  open  dielectric  resonator  for  any  positive
difference

that  holds  if  the  involved  dielectric  constants  are  independent  of  the
frequency in the interval (wmin, wmax). If the dependence on the frequency

frequencies can be obtained by an  iterative  procedure from the relations

This  iterative  procedure  must  continue  until  the  convergence  is  reached
or until the condition of consistence  nmax(w)‡ nmin(w) fails.  Eq.  18  gives
the  width  of  the  frequency  band  in  terms  of  the  ratio  between  the  limit
frequencies;  such  ratio  will  be  called  in  the  following  frequency  band
extension.

The above analysis gives the ratio between the limit frequencies only
in terms of the complex dielectric permittivities of the involved materials.
In  particular  a  considerable  role  is  plaid  by  the  intrinsic  losses  of  the

material forming the WGDR. As a practical example, assuming 

e

from  Eq.  18  it  follows  that  the  ideal  band  becomes  wider  than  six
decades  when  materials  with  (tand ) £ 10-8 are employed (like sapphire or
rutile  at  microwave  frequencies  cooled  down  to  the  liquid  helium
temperature).

4.   Effective frequency band of a WGDR
The ideal frequency band cannot be obtained in elementary structures
like single discs or spherical dielectric resonators; the fundamental reason
that  limits  the  real  frequency  band  (in  the  following  called  effective
frequency  band)  is  related  to  the  existence  of  transverse  modes  with
modal  indices  m and/or  l  different  from  zero.  In  order  to  clarify  the
influence  of  these  modes  on  the  ideal  frequency  band,  the  illustrative
case  of  a  simple  disc  WGDR  is  first  discussed.  Afterwards  the  more
general case of a circular ring WGDR with arbitrary internal radius and
thickness will be treated.

4a. Simple disc WGDR
The number  L  of  modes  with  different  axial  index  l  supported  by  a
dielectric disc is essentially fixed by its thickness  t. In order to calculate
L, b  can be rewritten, by using Eq. 2, as

where  the  axial  propagation  constant  h  has  been  expressed  in  terms  of
index l and thickness t of the resonator; the factor g, typically of the order
of  unity,  becomes  equal  to  1  when  the  field  goes  to  zero  on  the  plane
surfaces of the resonator, as in the case of a metallic cavity [19].

                                                                                                                                                               G. Annino et al.

The number  L can be obtained from Eq. 19, by imposing an angle of
incidence  of  the  radiation  on  the  plane  surfaces  of  the  resonator  greater
than the critical one [8]. The values of the axial propagation constant are

considered.  Assuming  the  free  spectral  range  of  these  transverse  modes

When the frequency increases, the spectrum of the resonator becomes
more and more dense until the structure is no more resonant, at least if it
is not possible to excite selectively the different modes; from the point of
view  of  the  geometrical  optics,  when  the  dimensions  of  the  resonator
become too large in respect to the wavelength, the number of the possible
paths  by  which  a  ray  returns  to  its  starting  point  exceedingly  increases,
and  it  is  no  more  possible  to  find  an  univocal  condition  for  constructive
interference.  The  presence  of  the  transverse  modes  then  limits  the
effective frequency band of the resonator in respect to the ideal one; this
limitation  can  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  effective  finesse  of  the

order,  an  equivalent  form  of  this  equation  can  be  inferred  directly  from
Eq. 19; indeed, since the number of modes increases with the number of

reached as fast as wk, where k is the dimension of the space generated by

4b. Circular ring WGDR
The analysis developed in subsection 4a can be generalized to the case
of  a  disc  with  a  central  axial  hole;  this  topology  is  important  because  it
allows a partial suppression of transverse radial modes (m „  0).

Let us consider a circular ring WGDR with axial thickness t and radial

thickness Dr, as indicated in Fig. 1.

Under these approximations the effective band extension

in a term given by the dielectric properties of the involved materials (the
ideal band extension) and a term given by the geometrical properties. The

reaches the ideal limit wmax, since in this limit also  wlow reach  wmax (Eq.

The previous discussion evidences that the ideal band results from the
envelope  of  the effective bands obtained for all the allowed geometrical
dimensions of an annular WGDR.

Finally,  by  imposing  the  condition  that  the  effective  band  is  not
degenerate, the allowed values for the parameters  p and  q  are  obtained;

5.  Concluding remarks and outlooks
In  conclusion,  the  role  that  geometrical  and  dielectric  properties  of  a
planar  WGDR  plays  in  the  determination  of  some  basic  parameters  has
been investigated in this paper. In particular, the maximum and minimum
allowed  radius  and  azimuthal  index  have  been  obtained  in  terms  of
complex  dielectric  constants  and  working  frequency.  These  results  give
simple  and  direct  criteria  for  the  design  of  WGDRs  for  the  different
applications,  in  presence  of  materials  having  whatever  value  of  complex
dielectric constant.

the  WGDRs  are 

involved  materials  only.  Since 

When the radius of the resonator is fixed, the above discussed analysis
gives  the  limit  values  of  the  resonance  frequency,  so  that  the  working
frequency band can be determined in terms of the dielectric properties of
the 
typically
characterized  by  high  values  of  the  azimuthal  index  n,  they  can  be
considered  wideband  resonators  as  the  working  frequency  band  is
expected  much  greater  than  the  free  spectral  range.  The  obtained  results
clarify quantitatively the meaning of this general property; the ideal band
of extremely low loss materials can span several decades, as for instance
in  the  case  of  sapphire.  However  different  practical  reasons,  as  the
difficulty to find a dielectric material transparent over the full ideal band,
severely  limit  the  realization  of  a  very  wideband  WGDR.  Moreover,
since  in  a  homogeneous  structure  the  behavior  of  the  different  resonant
modes  is  expected  quite  similar,  the  selective  excitation  of  only  one
family of modes is difficult, so the effect of all the active resonant modes
must be taken into account. This leads to the meaningful definition of an
effective frequency band, which results smaller than the ideal one at least
by a factor 3 in terms of decades.

To overcome the limitations due to the presence of transverse modes,
non-homogeneous structures can be considered. Some non-homogeneous
resonators  will  be  discussed  in  a  following  companion  paper,  in  which
the  multiple-band  properties  of  stacked  WGDRs  working  at  their  ideal
limiting frequencies are substantiated.

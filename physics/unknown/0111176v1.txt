THE LANDAU DAMPING EFFECT AND
COMPLEX-VALUED NATURE OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES

V.V. Lyahov, V.M. Neshchadim

1. Introduction

Complexifying  physics  and  trying  to  find  an  opportunity  of  experimental 
verification  of  complex-valued  nature  of  physical  quantities  [1, 2],  we should 
not  forget  that  two  complex  quantities  have  been  already  introduced  into 
physics.  Complex  frequency  ω → ω +  iδ and  mass  m  → m  - iε were 
introduced. The frequency was introduced into classical physics, more exact, in 
plasma  physics,  and  is  associated  with  a  so-called  Landau  damping  in 
uncollisional plasma; the mass was introduced into quantum electrodynamics, in 
the perturbation theory. What for and how the complex frequency and mass are 
introduced?

In  1946  L.D.  Landau's  paper  [3]  was  published  as  a  response  to  the 
examinations  initiated  by  A.A.Vlasov  [4],  [5].  A.A.  Vlasov  has  faced  the 
following problem: at examination of the dispersion equations for uncollisional 
plasma  there  appeared  improper  integrals.  Velocity  integrals  were  determined 
along  a  real  axis  and  had  a  pole  feature.  A.A.  Vlasov  has  substituted  an 
improper integral by its principal value on the real axis:

L.D.  Landau  pointed  out  the  inadmissibility  of  such  procedure  and,  actually, 
offered to take a principal value of an integral with exit into a complex plane:

(1)

This expression should be understood as its multiplication by a certain function 
followed by integration; imaginary iνis formed by the prior introduction of the 
complex  frequency  ω → ω + iδ.  From  the  mathematical  point  of  view  such 
procedure  is  correct  since  the  complex  integration  could  be  done  along  any 
path, including the path when limits to the right and to the left of a jump of the 
intergrand function can be taken equal.

The formal mathematical reasons have caused us to abandon the real axis 
and  to  go  to  a  complex  plane.  Thus,  an  essential  physical  result  was  the 
conclusion that uncollisional damping of electromagnetic waves in plasma is a 

2

possibility. This deduction is backed up by experimental results in the Vavilov-
Cerenkov effect.

2. Formulation of the problem

But why is it only frequency? Why only frequency has been assigned with a 
small imaginary part? Is it has any distinction among other physical quantities? 
Let’s refer to the improper integral in the Landau damping theory: s

The  complexification  assumes  that  all  magnitudes  are  to  be  considered  as 
complex; the integral (2) should be presented in this case as:

+∞

And both addends are to be investigated. But, as it mentioned above, the most 
prime combinations are first be considered.  Let only frequency ω and a wave 
vector k be considered as complex.

It  is  seen  that  formally  the  possibility  to  integrate  expression  (2)  may  be 

provided not only through introduction of a complex frequency 

ω  →ω + iδ,

but also the structure 

k → k ± iε.

ω→ω± iδ.

In this case:

Let's assume that both requirements (3) and (4) are obeyed, with expression 

(3) be substituted by more common 

ω - kυ→(ω±iδ) - (k ±iε)υ= ω - kυ±i(δ  − ευ) = x + iυ.

If the imaginary part of the pole is υ > 0, the formula (1) is valid; if υ < 0, it 
should be used the following relation:

In  selection  of  a  positive  value  of  the  imaginary  part  of  the  complex

frequency  (3),  we  should  appeal  to  “physical  sense”  which  recommends  to 
eliminate (zeroize) perturbation of the cumulative distribution function δf(P,r,t) 
at  t=  -∞.  In  the  accepted  time  dependence  δ f  ∼ exp(-iωt), such  zeroing  is 
possible  in  the  presence  of  the  positive  imaginary  part  ω → ω +  iδ.  But  it 
should  be  noted  that  first,  the  infinity  is  physically  unattainable,  and  it  is  not 
correct  to  set  conditions  at  infinity;  second,  in  other  physical theories,  for 
example the big bang theory, it is supposed that at a start time to the system was 
singular,  i.e.  perturbation  not  only  did  not  disappear,  but  was  infinitely  large. 
The  “physical  sense”  requires  careful  handling  and  is  often  introduced  to 
smooth the roughness a physical theory that in general has been already created. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  relation  (5)  may  be  valid  for  frequency  with 

positive imaginary ω → ω+ iδ as well, if k → k + iεand |ευ| > |δ|.

The dispersion equation for case (1) is well known, for example refer to [6]:

This  equation  corresponds  to  a  high-frequency  branch  of  longitudinal 
oscillations in the homogeneous isotropic plasma.

3. Solution of a problem

We obtained a dispersion equation for case (5) in which as opposed to (1) a

So, the condition (4) may result in other dispersion equation.

Let’s  investigate  the  difference  between  the  dispersion  equations  (6)  and 
(7). Radicals of the equations were determined numerically using the iterative 
method of Newton. It turned out that at the actual value k = Rek the equation (6) 
is satisfied with complex frequency with the negative imaginary part ω= Reω-
iImω, which determines the Landau damping. But the equation (7) (first of the 
two given) is satisfied with complex frequency with the positive imaginary part 
ω = Reω + iImωat k = Rek and at k = Rek + iImk, and the positiveness of an 
imaginary  part  of  frequency  is  testimony  of  an  inverse  process  of  the Landau 
antidamping.  Table 1a   shows  an  iterative    solution  of  the  equation  (6),  and 
Table  1b  -  of  the  equation  (7).  In  all  cases  Rek  =  (RLDebay)-1=  (4πNe2/κTe)0.5
where  k is  the  Boltzmann  constant.  Electronic  plasma  frequency  ωLe N=1014, 
Te=Ti=108 C was taken as zero approximation, which is close to the parameters 
of thermonuclear fusion.

4. Summary

If assumed that along with the frequency ω→ ω+ iδthe wave vector k →k 
+ iεalso has complex nature, then under certain conditions in the system (when 
the relation  (5) is  fulfilled)  the Landau  damping may give  way to build-up of 
oscillation. It is possible that plasma cannot be considered merely as ionized gas 
(as it was supposed by A.A. Vlasov as well) described by the near- Maxwellian 
distribution.  It  may  be  the  reason  that  thermonuclear  fusion  with  magnetic 
confinement has not been realized till now because some modes of oscillation 
cannot be removed.

A similar situation is observed in the quantum electrodynamics. In order to 
take Feynman integrals, which are improper, the complex value is assigned to 
the mass m →m —iε, which is the heart of the renormalization theory. And in 
this case, other parameters may improve the situation along with mass.

So,  the mathematical formalism of the physical theory has already caused 
us to enter two complex magnitudes with small imaginary parts: frequency  ω
→ ω +  iδ and  mass  m → m - iε.  Theoretical  deductions  prove  to  be  true 
experimentally.  In  this  situation,  having  put  aside  a  paradigm  about  real 
physical quantities, it is well to leave the real axis and go to the complex plane 
and to explore the problems of passage to the limit in a complex neighborhood 
of the real axis.

5

Within the framework of the hypothesis offered by authors about complex-
valued nature of physical quantities, the effect of the Landau damping has been 
explored  with  assumption  that  not  only  frequency  can  be  a  small  imaginary 
component  but  also  a  wave  vector.  The  numerical  solution  of  the  obtained 
dispersion  equation  testifies  that  uncollisional  damping  is  accompanied  in  a 
certain  region  of  space  by  antidumping  of  waves,  and  in  particular  situations 
antidumping  may  prevail  over  damping.  It  is  possible  that  this  effect  may 
explain the experimental difficulties connected with inhibition of instabilities of 
plasma in the problem of controllable thermonuclear fusion.

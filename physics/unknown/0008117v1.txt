Abstract

field,  and 

Bunches of high charge (up to 10 nC) are compressed
in  length  in  the  CTF  II  magnetic  chicane  to  less  than
0.2 mm rms. The short bunches radiate coherently in the
chicane  magnetic 
the  horizontal  and
longitudinal  phase  space  density  distributions  are
affected. This paper reports the results of beam emittance
and  momentum  measurements.  Horizontal  and  vertical
emittances  and  momentum  spectra  were  measured  for
different  bunch  compression  factors  and  bunch  charges.
In  particular,  for  10  nC  bunches,  the  mean  beam
momentum  decreased  by  about  5%  while  the  FWHM
momentum  spread  increased  from  5%  to  19%.  The
experimental results are compared with simulations made
with the code TraFiC4.

1  INTRODUCTION

Short  electron  bunches 

traversing  a  dipole  with
bending radius 7 can emit coherent synchrotron radiation
(CSR) at wavelengths longer than the bunch length. The
enhancement  of  the  radiated  power,  with  respect  to  the
classical synchrotron radiation, can be expressed as [1]:

where  a  longitudinal  Gaussian  distribution  of  the  N
particles  with  constant  rms  bunch  length  8Z  along  the
curved trajectory are assumed.

The  CSR  induces  an  average  momentum  loss  and  a
momentum  spread  on  the  bunch.  For  relativistic  beams
the  momentum  loss  is  independent  of  the  beam  energy
and  the  effect  can  be  treated  like  a  wake-field.  Since  it
takes  place  in  a  dispersive  region,  the  transverse  phase
space distribution is also affected, and the beam emittance
in the bending plane increases.

These  effects  are  a  concern 

in  all  accelerator
applications  in  which  high-charge  short  bunches  are
needed, e.g., free electron lasers, linear colliders and two-
beam  accelerators.  Analytical 
treatments  have  been
developed  for  idealised  conditions  [1-4]  but  for  many
practical  cases  the  effect  must  be  treated  numerically.
Some codes have been developed for this purpose [5,6],
but  a  complete  benchmark  of 
the  codes  with
measurements  is  so  far  lacking.  The  parameters  of  the
drive  beam  in  the  second  Compact  Linear  Collider  Test
Facility,  CTF  II  [7]  are  well  suited  to  study  the  CSR
effect experimentally.

CTF II  (see  Fig. 1)  was  built  to  demonstrate  the
feasibility of two-beam acceleration at 30 GHz. The high-
charge drive beam is generated in a 3 GHz RF gun, and
accelerated  in  two  Travelling  Wave  Structures  (TWS).
The  drive  beam  bunches  are  then  compressed  in  a
magnetic  chicane,  and  generate  30  GHz  RF  power  in  a
series  of  Power  Extraction  and  Transfer  Structures
(PETS).  This  power  is  used  to  accelerate  a  low-charge
probe beam, in a parallel beam line.

Figure 1: The CLIC Test Facility CTF II. The CSR experiments were performed in the drive beam line (upper part).

Only  the  drive  beam  line  of  CTF  II  has  been  used  to
perform  the  CSR  experiment.  Single  bunches  with
charges of 5 and 10 nC have been used. For both charges,
the  horizontal  and  vertical  beam  emittances  and  the
momentum  spectra  of 
the  drive  beam  have  been
measured  as  a  function  of  the  deflection  angle  in  the
chicane.  Similar  measurements  have  been  performed
already in CTF II [8], but limited to the emittances. The
results of simulations made using the code TraFiC4 [5] are
reported for comparison.

2  EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Bunch compression is used in CTF II to enhance the 30
GHz  power  production,  and  is  achieved  by  acceleration
off-crest (such that particles at the tail of the bunch have
higher  energies  than  those  at  the  head),  in  combination
with  a  magnetic  chicane  composed  of  three  rectangular
dipoles.  The  deflection  angle  in  the  first  and  the  last
dipole can be varied from 3.7G to 14G (twice these values
in 
the  central  dipole).  The  corresponding  energy
dependence  of  the  path  length  R56 =  ds  /  (dE/E)  ranges
from  6  mm  to  90  mm.  Due  to  the  construction  of  the
vacuum  chamber,  the  chicane  cannot  be  switched  off
completely. Using this scheme, rms bunch lengths of less
than 0.4 mm can by achieved for bunch charges of 10 nC.
The  beam  momentum  spectra  were  measured  at  the
entrance  to  the  chicane  by  switching  off  the  last  two
chicane magnets and using the first one as a spectrometer.
A second spectrometer at the end of the line permits the
measurement of the beam spectra after the passage in the
chicane.  The  PETS  were  deactivated  by  shielding  them
with metallic tubes, in order not to perturb the momentum
distribution. Two wall-current monitors placed in front of
the  chicane  and  in  front  of  the  second  spectrometer
measured  the  beam  intensities,  in  order  to  monitor  the
losses.

The  bunch  lengths  were  measured  behind  the  chicane
by  analysing  the  frequency  spectrum  of  the  mm-wave
radiation  excited  by  the  beam  passing  an  RF  waveguide
connected  to  the  vacuum  chamber  [9].  Transverse  beam
profiles were recorded after the chicane using an optical
transition  radiation  (OTR)  screen  and  a  camera.  The
horizontal  and  vertical  emittances  were  measured
simultaneously  by  using 
the  quadrupole  scanning
technique.  In  order  to  cover  the  full  range  of  phase
advances  from  0G  to  180G  in  both  transverse  planes,  the
quadrupole  strengths  of  a  bipolar  triplet  were  varied
independently.  For  accurate  determination  of  the  beam
widths, only those profiles were selected which fitted on
the OTR screen.

The  off-crest  RF  phase  and  the  range  of  chicane
to  achieve  over-
settings  were  selected 
compression  of  the  initial  bunch  length,  thus  covering  a
sufficient range in bunch lengths.

LENGTH

The  beam  momentum  spectra  measured  for  different
bunch  compressor  settings  are  shown  in  Fig.  2  (5  nC
case) and Fig. 3 (10 nC case). The spectra from TraFiC4
simulations are also shown. Since the spectrometer at the
end of the beam line consists of a deflecting dipole it also
represents  a  source  of  CSR,  and  the  spectra  result  from
the sum of the CSR effects in the compressor chicane and
in the spectrometer.

simulations.

from 

For  5  nC,  no  significant  changes  of  the  mean  beam
momentum  was  observed,  although 
the  momentum
spread increased by a factor four at full compression with
respect  to  the  initial  spread,  and  decreased  at  over-
compression.  For  charges  of  10  nC,  a  decrease  of  the
mean momentum by 2 MeV/c, i.e. 5% of the initial beam
momentum,  was  measured  at  full  compression.  The
momentum spread  shows  a  behaviour  similar  to  the  one
described  for  5  nC.  In  the  5  nC  case  the  dependence  of
the  measured  bunch  length  on  R56  shows  a  symmetric
shape as expected from linear longitudinal dynamics. On
the  other  hand, 
the
corresponding curve for 10 nC indicates a strong impact
of CSR on the longitudinal properties for R56 > 20 mm.

the  asymmetric 

shape  of 

Using  the  program  TraFiC4,  the  bunch,  consisting  of
500 macro particles, was tracked from the entrance to the
chicane  to  the  end  of  line  spectrometer  dipole.  At  each
step,  the  sum  of  fields  resulting  from  magnetic  fields,
space  charge  and  CSR  wake-fields  was  applied  to  the
macro  particles.  The  resulting  bunch  lengths,  emittances

and  momentum  spectra  have  been  calculated  from  the
final distributions.

In order to determine the initial conditions to be used in
the  simulations,  the  bunch  lengths  measured  after  the
chicane  have  been  used  together  with  the  momentum
spectra recorded at the entrance to the chicane. The initial
phase  space  distributions  in  the  longitudinal  plane  have
been reconstructed taking into account the contribution to
the intra-bunch momentum correlation of the off-crest RF
phase  and  of  the  short-range  longitudinal  wake-fields  in
the  accelerating  structures.  The  initial  bunch  length  has
been  chosen  to  fit  the  momentum  spectra  at  the  chicane
entrance and the measured bunch lengths,  assuming  that
the CSR does not influence the bunch length. As already
mentioned  above,  this  assumption  seems  to  be  justified
only for R56 < 20 mm in the 10 nC case. Indeed, while a
linear  longitudinal  model  describes  well  the  measured
bunch  length  dependence  from  R56  for  5  nC,  no  set  of
initial  conditions  could  be  found  that  can  describe  the
measured  values  for  10  nC.  Therefore  only  the  bunch
lengths  for  small  R56  have  been  used  in  this  case.  Since
only  a  few  measurement  points  are  available  for  the  fit,
the  input  parameters  for  the  10  nC  measurements  are
known with less accuracy.

In the case of 5 nC the dependence of the observables
on  R56  was  well  reproduced.  For  10  nC  the  calculated
bunch  lengths  agreed  with  the  measured  ones  until  full
compression,  but  the  asymmetric  shape  of  the  bunch
length  curve  was  not  reproduced,  although  the  TraFiC4
simulation  looks  more  accurate  than  the  simple  linear
calculation. The amount of momentum loss for 10 nC was
calculated correctly, but the experimental and theoretical
curves  are  shifted  with  respect  to  each  other,  possibly
indicating  different  initial  longitudinal  beam  parameters
in the experiments and the simulations. Another possible
explanation is a fluctuation in the initial beam parameters
while the  measurement  was  taken.  Especially,  variations
in RF power and phase could be invoked, since the same
initial  conditions  have  been  used  to  simulate  all  of  the
measurement  points  and  a  phase  variation  of  a  few
degrees  would  be  enough  to  explain  the  discrepancies
found.

On  the  other  hand,  a  very  good  matching  of  the
measured  and  calculated  momentum  spreads  was  found
for both cases. In the case of 5 nC, the simulations reveal
no splitting of the maximum and the shapes of the spectra
show a good agreement. In the 10 nC case, although the
rms  widths  are  in  good  agreement,  the  measured  and
simulated  momentum  spectra  have  somewhat  different
shapes.  The  formation  of  two  maxima  occurs  in  the
simulations for smaller values of R56. Since the CSR wake
depends  on  the  exact  longitudinal  charge  distribution
within the bunch, the details of the momentum spectrum
shape should depend on that as well.

Figure  5:  Evolution  of  the  bunch  length,  the  rms
momentum spread and the momentum loss (from bottom
to  top)  along  the  CTF  II  beam  line  as  simulated  with
TraFiC4, for 10 nC. The results with two different setting
of the chicane are shown, corresponding to R56 = 34 mm
(solid line) and R56 = 15 mm (dashed line).

In the simulation an initial Gaussian charge distribution
has  been  assumed,  but  previous  bunch 
length
measurements  with  a  streak  camera  indicate  a  different,
asymmetric  charge  distribution.  The  simulations  show
that the splitting of the maxima in the spectra for 10 nC is
due to CSR in the chicane, since such a feature is present
in the simulated spectrum right after the chicane.

On the other hand, the broadening of the spectra seems
to  be  caused  by  space  charge  during  the  drift  to  the
spectrometer.  This  is  apparent  in  Fig.  5,  where  the
evolution of the bunch length, the momentum spread and
the momentum loss  along  the  beam  line,  simulated  with
TraFiC4, are shown.

In spite of the fact that some features of the simulated
momentum  loss  curve  are  not  yet  understood,  from
Fig. 5,  it  can  be  seen  that  the  momentum  loss  is  mainly
concentrated in the chicane region where the bunches are
short, and is a direct indication of CSR emission.  On the
other  hand,  for  R56  =  34  mm,  the  momentum  spread
increases  along  the  whole  beam  line  after  the  chicane,
showing that such growth is not directly caused by a CSR
effect.

The  measured  horizontal  and  vertical  emittances  after
the  chicane  are  plotted  in  Fig.  6  as  function  of  R56,
together with the bunch lengths.

The measured vertical emittances for 5 nC are constant
within  the  error  bars,  and  are  consistent  with  the
simulation  results.  The  measured  horizontal  emittances
for 5 nC increase until full compression, then a saturation
occurs.  The  four  highest  values  seem  to  be  shifted  with
respect  to  the  lower  values.  This  shift  might  be  due  to
dispersion at the location of the OTR screen, caused by a
mismatch of the relative magnetic strength of the chicane
dipoles.  It  must  be  noted  that  these  four  points  were
recorded  after  switching  off  the  last  two  magnets  of  the
chicane in order to check the beam momentum, and then
switching on the magnets again.

the  horizontal  emittance 

For  10  nC  the  measured  vertical  emittance  shows  a
maximum at full compression. This qualitative behaviour
is found also in the simulations. The measured data points
for 
scatter  after  over-
compression,  thus  not  allowing  meaningful  conclusions.
The huge growth of the horizontal emittance predicted by
the  simulations  was  not  found  experimentally.  It  can  be
noted  that  the  increase  of  the  momentum  spread  also
affects  the  accuracy  of  the  emittance  measurements  and
contributes to the error bars and the scattering of the data
points.

5  CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
The measurements made in the CTF II drive beam line
showed  clear  signs  of  CSR  emission.  In  particular  the
momentum  loss  and  bunch  length  as  a  function  of  the
bunch  compressor  setting  in  the  10  nC  case  are  well
explained  by  the  CSR  effect,  such  as  the  two-peak
momentum spectrum shape at 10 nC. A good agreement
was found between measurements and simulations made
with  the  TraFiC4  code  for  all  observables,  except  the
emittance growth for bunches of 10 nC, which is not yet
understood.

Future  experiments  will  aim  in  particular  at  an
experimental  investigation  of  the  shielding  effect  of  the
beam  pipe  on  the  CSR  emission.  The  extension  of  the
CSR spectrum is limited at the high-frequency end by the
bunch length, and at the low-frequency end by the cut-off
of  the  beam  pipe.  When  the  beam  pipe  dimensions  are
small with respect to the bunch length, CSR  emission  is
suppressed.  While  this  is  indeed  the  case  in  many
accelerators, 
the  free  space
approximation is valid. It would be interesting to explore
the  intermediate  regime  since  often  only  a  partial
shielding can be used to reduce the unwanted CSR effect
in the case of very small bunches. Several approaches to
the  calculation  of  the  shielding  effect  exist  [1-4,  10],
using different approximations.  The TraFiC4 code is also
capable  of 
the  shielding,  and  could  be
benchmarked against the measurements.

Short  bunches  will  be  passed  through  a  new  four-
magnet  chicane  installed  downstream  of  the  bunch
compressor.  Three  vacuum  chambers  of  different  height
will  be  used  in  order  to  provide  different  shielding
environments.  The  new  chicane  has  been  designed  for
large deflection angles and small dispersion functions, i.e.
small R56. Therefore the bunch length can be made short
and  relatively  constant  in  the  new  chicane,  while  CSR
emission in this region will be high. A further advantage
will  be  the  smaller  disturbance  from  possible  dispersion
errors.

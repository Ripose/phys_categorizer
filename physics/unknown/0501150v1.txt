Abstract 

 

Simulation of bulk materials with some components locally far from equilibrium 
usually  requires  a  computationally  intensive  quantum  mechanical  description  to  capture  the 
relevant  mechanisms  (e.g.  effects  of  chemistry).  Multi-scale  modeling  entails  a  compromise 
whereby  the  most  accurate  quantum  description  is  used  only  where  needed  and  the  remaining 
bulk of the material is replaced by a simpler classical system of point particles. The problem of 
constructing an appropriate potential energy function for this classical system is addressed here. 
For  problems  relating  to  fracture,  a  consistent  embedding  of  a  quantum  (QM)  domain  in  its 
classical  (CM)  environment  requires  that  the  classical  system  should  yield  the  same  structure 
and  elastic  properties  as  the  QM  domain  for  states  near  equilibrium.  It  is  proposed  that  an 
appropriate  classical  potential  can  be  constructed  using  ab  initio  data  on  the  equilibrium 
structure  and  weakly  strained  configurations  calculated  from  the  quantum  description,  rather 
than  the  more  usual  approach  of  fitting  to  a  wide  range  of  empirical  data.  This  scheme  is 
illustrated in detail for a model system, a silica nanorod that has the proper stiochiometric ratio 
of Si:O as observed in real silica. The potential energy is chosen to be pairwise additive, with the 
same  pair  potential  functional  form  as  familiar  phenomenological  TTAM  potential.  Here,  the 
parameters  are  determined  using  a  genetic  algorithm  with  force  data  obtained  directly  from  a 
quantum  calculation.  The  resulting  potential  gives  excellent  agreement  with  properties  of  the 
reference  quantum  calculations  both  for  structure  (bond  lengths,  bond  angles)  and  elasticity 
(Young’s modulus). The proposed method for constructing the classical potential is carried out 
for two different choices for the quantum mechanical description: a transfer Hamiltonian method 
(NDDO with coupled-cluster parameterization) and density functional theory (with plane wave 
basis  set  and  PBE  exchange  correlation  functional).  The  quality  of  the  potentials  obtained  in 
both cases is quite good, although the two quantum rods have significant differences.

Introduction 

 

I. 

 

1

For  studying  phenomena  like  crack  propagation,  stress  corrosion  etc.  one  can  apply  ab 

initio  quantum  mechanics  only  to  the  small  reactive  regions  because  these  methods  are 

computationally  too  intensive  for  application  to  the  entire  bulk.  Instead,  the  remainder  of  the 

material  is  typically  described  by  more  efficient  but  less  accurate  classical  molecular  dynamics 

(MD) methods. This scheme of combining different methods for different regions in a sample is 

known as multi-scale modeling. 

 

One  of  challenges  with  such  multi-scale  modeling  is  the  compatibility  of  the  quantum 

(QM)  domain  with  the  classical  (CM)  region.  Independent  individual  treatment  of  the  two 

regions  can  result  in  a  mismatch  of  many  physical  quantities  like  forces,  charge  densities,  and 

elastic constants across the QM/CM boundary. To avoid this, the interatomic forces used in the 

MD simulation must be chosen to preserve selected properties of the underlying quantum theory 

used  in  the  QM  domain.  The  process  of  constructing  such  a  potential  is  illustrated  here  for  a 

simple test system, providing the prerequisite for a consistent embedding of a QM domain in a 

classical MD region with a seamless coupling between the two regions. This classical potential is 

developed  using  ab  initio  data  on  the  equilibrium  structure  and  weakly  strained  configurations 

calculated from the quantum description, rather than the more usual approach of fitting to a wide 

range  of  empirical  data.    The  latter  is  appropriate  when  a  classical  description  of  the  entire 

material is reasonable (e.g., near equilibrium) so that maximum correlation between the material 

simulated  and  the  real  material  is  attained.  In  contrast,  for  multi-scale  modeling  of  strain  to 

failure  the  primary  constraints  on  the  potential  are  those  of  internal  theoretical  consistency 

between the quantum and classical descriptions. The final accuracy of the model is therefore set 

by  the  quality  of  the  quantum  description,  not  by  the  fitting  of  the  potential  to  experiments. 

Further comment on this point is given in the Conclusions section. 

To  illustrate  this  approach  and  to  allow  a  quantitative  test  of  its  accuracy  a  relatively 

small system is considered for which the chosen quantum method can be applied globally as well 

as  to  the  partitioned  QM/CM  model.  Selected  properties  (e.g.,  force  data)  are  first  calculated

using a suitable approximate quantum mechanical method that incorporates the relevant physical 

mechanisms. Next, a parameterized functional form is chosen for the classical potential energy 

function.  Here,  it  is  taken  to  be  pairwise  additive  so  that  only  a  small  set  of  pair  potential 

parameters must be determined. These are chosen to be of the same functional form as current 

phenomenological models, but with the parameters chosen differently. An initial choice is made 

using  a  genetic  algorithm  to  give  a  good  fit  to  the  selected  quantum  properties.  The  algorithm 

effectively  locates  a  domain  of  the  relevant  parametric  minimum  for  the  given  constraints;  the 

parameters  found  are  then  checked  for  stability,  followed  by  a  global  scaling  (described  in 

Appendix), resulting in the final choice for the parameters and determining all pair potentials.   

  

The  test  system  is  a  silica  nanorod  [1]  with  the  proper  stoichiometric  ratio  of  Si:O 

observed in real silica. For the multi-scale modeling of this rod (Figure 1.) one of the rings near 

the center of the nanorod is treated quantum mechanically and the rest is treated classically. The 

method of embedding a QM domain in its CM environment is done by replacing the atoms at the 

boundary of the QM and CM domains by pseudo-atoms and approximating the rest of the rod by 

dipoles.

The  details  of  this  embedding  method  have  been  described  elsewhere  [2],  and  will  not  be 

considered  further  here.  Instead  the  following  focuses  on  the  choice  of  the  classical  potential 

energy and the resulting properties of the CM region. Specifically, the objective is to determine 

the  potential  energy  such  that  a CM  simulation  of  the  entire  nanorod  is  indistinguishable  from 

the QM description for all relevant properties in states near equilibrium. This is a prerequisite for 

expecting that the multi-scale modeling above can be internally consistent. 

The  standard  classical  pair  potentials  for  silica,  TTAM  [3]  and  BKS  [4],  fail  to  satisfy 

these  criteria.  Although  these  potentials  have  been  parameterized  using  data  for  equilibrium 

states, this is not sufficient to yield low strain behavior consistent with the transfer Hamiltonian 

(TH) as measured by the value of elastic constants.  Figure 2 shows the stress-strain curve for 

this  silica  nanorod  using  the  standard  TTAM  and BKS  pair  potentials  (see  Eq.  1  below).  Also 

shown for comparison are the reference results obtained from one of the two quantum methods 

considered here (TH [5]) for the entire rod.  These curves were generated by MD simulation for 

the entire nanorod subjected to longitudinal strain along the z direction by pulling the end caps 

with a fixed velocity. The remaining atoms in the rod were allowed to relax with their positions 

determined by MD. The temperature was kept constant by velocity rescaling [6]. The forces used 

were those from the TTAM potential, BKS potential, or Born-Oppenheimer QM calculations at 

each time step. The stress was calculated by taking the sum of the forces parallel to the loading 

direction on the constrained atoms divided by the projected cross-sectional area of the nuclei that 

comprise the end caps. The cross-sectional area was updated after every step to account for any 

motion in x or y direction. The simulation was done at a temperature of 10K with a strain rate of 

25 m/s and time steps of 2 fs. It is seen that for strains up to 4%, the Young’s modulus (Y) given 

by the initial slope for the TTAM rod (Y = 1214) differs from that of the TH rod (Y=1026) by 

 

4

18%  while  the  difference  between  the  BKS  (Y=1516)  and  TH  rod  is  even  more  than  50%. 

Clearly neither potential is a good candidate for an internally consistent multi-scale modeling in 

this system.

Proposed Method and Objectives 

The above results confirm that existing potentials may not be appropriate for multi-scale 

modeling  of  desired  properties  of  specific  systems  of  interest.  Instead,  it  is  proposed  here  that 

each  development  of  a  multi-scaling  algorithm  should  include  the  construction  of  its  own 

classical  potential.  That  construction  should  be  governed  primarily  by  two  components:  the 

chosen  quantum  mechanical  method  used  in  the  QM  domain,  and  the  particular  physical 

properties requiring the QM treatment. In addition, it is required that there be a limiting domain 

 

 

 

 

5

(usually,  near  equilibrium)  for  which  the  CM  and  QM  calculations  of  these  properties  are 

indistinguishable. 

 

The  proposed  method  is  as  follows.  A  QM  method  is  chosen  to  represent  the  essential 

physical mechanisms not explicitly accounted for in a CM representation. Selected properties of 

the  system  are  then  calculated  directly  using  the  QM  method.  Here,  these  properties  are  the 

forces on nuclei incorporating non-local electronic configuration and exchange effects, both for 

equilibrium and weakly strained conditions. Next, a functional form for the potential energy is 

chosen  for  classical  point  particles  replacing  the  atomic  constituents.  The  parameters  of  the 

potential energy function are determined by some optimization method based on fitting the data 

calculated from the QM method.   

 

There are several difficulties with the implementation of this general approach that must 

be addressed. Obtaining the ab initio QM data to constrain the potential can be problematic since 

the  complexity  of  that  calculation  is  indeed  the  motivation  for  multi-scale  modeling. 

Consequently, the determination of the potential must be done on sufficiently small samples that 

limited  benchmark  QM  calculations  are  feasible.  The  nanorod  considered  here  satisfies  this 

requirement for the quantum transfer Hamiltonian method, but is somewhat more difficult for the 

density functional method. Further comment on this is given below. A second issue is the choice 

of potential energy function. For practical MD simulation it is useful to restrict attention to two 

and three body potentials, but the functional form of these few body potentials is still optional. 

The  functional  forms  that  are  frequently  considered  have  their  genesis  in  the  theory  of 

intermolecular  interactions.  However,  their  application  to  materials  simulation  is  a  rather 

speculative  endeavor.  In  fact,  one  can  argue  that  there  is  no  fundamental  origin  for  such 

potentials  since  the  underlying  electronic  origin  is  both  non  local  and  many-body  in  nature. 

 

6

Instead, the potentials are view as constructs of the multi-scale model “trained” to give selected 

material properties but with no unique status otherwise. Here, for simplicity, only pair potentials 

are  considered  and  their  functional  forms  are  taken  to  be  the  same  as  the  phenomenological 

forms currently in use for silica but with undetermined parameters.  

 

Finally, the fitting of potential parameters to the QM data is neither straightforward nor 

unique since the parameter space is so large (here, 10 dimensional). Consequently, a variational 

method to minimize the difference between the CM and QM properties may encounter multiple 

local minima with different levels of stability for similar fitting of the data. Some compromise 

between  a  global  search  method  and  an  effective  local  search  is  required  in  practice.  This  is 

accomplished  here  by  the  initial  use  of  a  genetic  algorithm,  followed  by  an  over-all  spatial 

scaling. 

 

The objective here is to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to constructing a 

classical potential for the nanorod of Figure 1 as a test system.  Specifically, it is required that the 

potential obtained should yield the correct equilibrium structure (bond lengths, bond angles) and 

small strain elastic properties, as given by the chosen quantum theory. The results are quite good 

and are shown to be robust with respect to the choice of quantum method used.  

III.  Quantum Methods and Potential Energy Form 

The  multi-scale  problem  of  interest  is  to  describe  the  nanorod  strained  uniaxially  to 

failure.  It  is  expected  that  bonds  strained  beyond  a  few  percent  can  no  longer  be  described 

accurately by a CM model. Under such conditions, the details of the shared electronic structure 

become  important  and  the  actual  breaking  of  bonds  corresponds  to  a  complex  charge 

rearrangement that can be accounted for only by a suitably accurate quantum theory. Two such 

 

 

 

7

quantum  theories  are  considered  here.  First,  and  throughout  the  next  two  sections  a  transfer 

Hamiltonian (TH) method is used. This is a mean field, or Hartree-Fock like, description whose 

structure  is  simple  and  does  not  imply  correlations.  Consequently  the  solutions  are  Slater 

determinants  with  single  electron  wavefunctions  determined  quickly  and  analytically  using  a 

minimal basis set. The accuracy of this method is improved by parameterizing the Hamiltonian 

to fit certain predictions of the coupled cluster theory [7, 5] with single and double excitations 

(CCSD) where electron correlation is explicitly included. In this way, information about electron 

correlation is “transferred” to the mean field Hamiltonian. The primary advantage of this method 

is that practical calculations are possible on systems involving 100 – 200 nuclei.  

 

The second choice for the QM method considered here, and discussed in Section VB, is a 

density  functional  theory  (DFT)  calculation.  A  Parallel  multi-scale  program  package,  based  on 

Barnett's Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics BOMD [8] is used. A plane wave basis set and 

the  Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof  (PBE)  exchange-correlation  functional  [9]  have  been  chosen  for 

this  calculation.  This  is  a  fully  self-consistent  calculation  of  the  electronic  structure  including 

approximate, but explicit, electronic correlation. In this respect it might be considered superior to 

the  TH  method,  but  in  fact  there  is  no  benchmark  comparison  of  both  with  a  more  reliable 

coupled cluster calculation. However, it is important to emphasize at this point that the relative 

accuracy of the QM method is not at issue for the study here.  The problem posed is: given a QM 

method, can a classical potential be constructed to reproduce the structure and elastic properties 

of that method? It is shown below that the answer to this question is affirmative, even though the 

TH and DFT nanorods have significant differences. 

The classical potential energy function is assumed to be pairwise additive, with the pair 

potentials  having  the  same  functional  form  as  TTAM  [3]  and  BKS  [4]  potentials.  Despite  its 

 

8

known  limitations,  this  form  is  chosen  because  of  its  simplicity  in  implementation  and 

widespread use

term. They model the short-range repulsive and dipole dispersion, or van der Waals, interactions, 

respectively.  The  Coulomb  term  is  determined  by  a  single  parameter,  either  the  charge  on  the 

silicon  ion  or  on  the  oxygen  ion,  since  there  must  be  charge  neutrality  for  the  SiO

(i.e.,

). There are altogether 10 parameters, consisting of the charge q

Si and three pair 

parameters aij , bij  and cij  for each pair of interactions (O-O, Si-O and Si-Si).  

IV.  Determination of Parameters 

In the literature the parameters for the TTAM and BKS potentials have been chosen by 

fitting ab initio Hartree-Fock potential energy surfaces of  SiO4(4-)+4e+ and SiO4H4 respectively. 

Furthermore,  the  Si-Si  interactions  in  BKS  potential  are  arbitrarily  set  equal  to  zero.    The 

resulting values are given in Table 2 below. It is noted that this fitting was done with a low level 

Hartree-Fock  approximation  and  the  surface  was  explored  at  or  near  equilibrium  regions  only.  

In  contrast,  the  parameters  are  determined  here  by  the  method  described  above.  Since  MD 

requires  only  the  forces  between  ions,  these  forces  determined  directly  from  the  quantum 

mechanics are used as primary reference data. Ideally, these forces should be zero for the correct 

equilibrium structure and its stability. Furthermore, to assure good elastic properties information 

 

 

9

about  these  forces  for  small  strained  conditions  also  is  used  in  the  search  for  appropriate 

parameters. 

The  standard  approach  for  parameterization  consists  of  following  steps:  1)  choose 

properties  of  interest  (total  forces  on  atoms),  2)  choose  reference  data  (values  of  forces  for 

equilibrium and strained configurations), 3) perform some estimation of the parameters, 4) test 

against  reference  data  with  some  error  function,  5)  choose  a  variational  method  for  the  next 

estimate and convergence of the procedure.  

In our case the reference quantities are the QM forces on atoms of the rod in equilibrium, 

and when strained from its equilibrium structure. The error function L, for testing the quality of 

any chosen set of parameters is the weighted sum of absolute difference between the calculated 

forces from the trial potential and the reference forces, denoted by g(i) and f(i) respectively for 

the forces on the ith  ion of the rod

The  index  i  runs  over  all  ions  of  the  rod,  while  k  denotes  the  sum  over  data  sets  for  different 

structural  configurations  of  the  rod  (different  amounts  of  strain).  The  positive  numbers 

ka

  are 

chosen weights assigned to the different strain sets with

1 . In general the greatest weight 

∑ =
ka

k

was given to the equilibrium structure, with the weight decreasing for data with increasing strain. 

A typical distribution of weights was 

 = (0.5, 0.2,0 .1, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05) for percent strains (0, 1, 

ka

2, 3, 4, 5), respectively. Other forms for L (e.g., root mean square of differences or normalizing 

the difference) gave similar results.  

This error function is minimized in a space whose dimension is the number of adjustable 

parameters.  The  problem  of  such  a  high  dimensional  domain  is  the  existence  of  several  local 

 

10

minima  and  maxima.  Gradient  optimizing  routines  [10]  seek  extrema  in  the  neighborhood  of 

initial chosen point without sampling the whole space and hence are only local in scope. Further 

improvement can be sought only through some sort of random restart. One can repeatedly restart 

the search algorithm at other randomly chosen points but as the dimension of the space increases 

such  a  process  becomes  highly  inefficient.  Therefore  a  genetic  algorithm  [11]  has  been  used 

which doesn't suffer from such disadvantages. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm (GA) doesn't 

require  calculation  of  derivatives  and  hence  is  more  efficient.  The  standard  PIKAIA  code  [12] 

for  the  GA  has  been  used.  However  once  a  neighborhood  of  an  extrema  is  reached  the  GA 

converges slowly near each extremum since they rely primarily on the mutation rate to generate 

small  incremental  changes  in  the  population.    If  the  global  minimum  has  not  been  located  the 

search  will  begin  to  stagnate.  This  is  due  to  the  successive  removal  of  comparatively  less  fit 

individuals  from  the  population,  which,  after  many  generations,  results  in  a  population  of 

parameter sets which are all more or less equally fit and the evolution of the parameters stalls. 

This problem is analogous to that of the gradient methods getting trapped in local minima.  

For a given QM data set the parameters obtained by the GA assures forces accurate to the 

chosen  tolerance.  However,  this  does  not  assure  that  the  equilibrium  structure  obtained  using 

these  parameters  is  stable.  Stability  of  the  rod  was  tested  checked  using  a  Broyden-Fletcher-

Goldfarb-Shanno [13] energy minimization simulation at 0 K temperature. In this method [13], 

the  function  to  be  minimized  (energy  in  our  case)  is  expanded  to  second  order  in  terms  of 

parameter set p (different geometries of the rod in our case) as

. This process continues until

 goes below some acceptable tolerance. As anticipated, it was found that there are numerous 

local  minima  in  the  parameter  space,  and  several  possible  sets  of  potential  parameters  were 

found from the GA that yielded a stable rod.  

Rather than require convergence of the GA to a higher level of accuracy for the forces, a 

lower tolerance was used to get a first estimate of the parameters. From the resulting set yielding 

a stable rod, the one with least structural error in bond lengths and bond angles was chosen for 

the second stage of analysis. At that point one might think of switching to Newton methods, i.e.  

to  construct  hybrid  schemes  of  GA  and  gradient  based  methods  using  GA  results  as  a  starting 

guess.  Instead  it  was  noticed  that  the  structure  resulting  from  parameters  of  the  first  estimate 

differed from the QM rod mainly by an overall spatial scaling. Consequently, the final parameter 

set was obtained by a simple rescaling of those from the first estimate (see Appendix), under the 

constraints of the given QM structure and linear stability.  

V.  Results 

A. 

Transfer Hamiltonian Quantum Mechanics 

Consider now the case for which the TH QM method is used to generate forces for the 

entire rod, under conditions of equilibrium and strains up to 10%. Initially, only equilibrium and 

small  strain  data  (up  to  5%)  were  used  in  the  GA  error  function  L.  Together  with  subsequent 

scaling a set of potential parameters yielding good structure and elastic properties up to 5% was 

obtained,  as  desired.  As  expected,  deviations  in  the  elastic  properties  for  the  TH  and  the  new 

potential were observed at still higher strains. Unfortunately, the classical rod based on the new 

potential became more ductile than the quantum rod. Although this is the domain for which the 

 

12

classical potential no longer represents the quantum rod, it is desirable for multi-scale modeling 

that CM domain should grow less ductile than the QM domain so that the large strain behavior is 

localized in the QM domain where it is properly treated. This qualitative property was attained 

by repeating the parameterization using QM force data up to 10% expansion in the GA. The data 

for  forces  at  the  end  caps  were  excluded  in  this  case  as  the  bonding  at  large  strain  becomes 

significantly  different  from  that  in  the  bulk  and  is  misleading  the  GA.  (It  is  observed  that  the 

information about the bulk force data is sufficient to generate the end cap structure.)  

Table 1 shows the final parameters for the CM potential constructed in this way, along 

with the standard TTAM and BKS parameters.

Table 1.  Parameters for New Potential 

 It  is  noted  that  the  values  of  the  charges  and  bij  for  the  new  potential  are  similar  to  those  of 

TTAM or BKS, but that the cij are always much smaller for the new potential. This suggests a 

very much more repulsive character of this potential at short-range, as illustrated in Figure 3 for 

the Si-O interactions.

This new potential next was used in MD simulations to obtain the stress-strain curves for 

a classical model of the nanorod. The simulation was carried out under the same conditions as 

for the TH (temperature of 10 K and pulling the end-caps at 25 m/s).  Figure 4 shows the results 

for this new potential, together with those for the TTAM and BKS potentials, in comparison with 

the TH results. The stress-strain curve obtained from the new potential agrees well with the TH 

curve up to about 5 % strain. Accordingly, the Young's modulus obtained from the new potential 

agrees very well with that from the reference TH. At larger strains the CM results deviate from 

the TH towards larger stress, as desired. The oscillations in the curves for the classical potentials 

were diminished considerably by performing MD simulations at lower temperatures (down to 0.2 

K) and by adiabatic expansions (0 K). The Young’s modulus does not change significantly in the 

range 0 K < T < 50 K. 

For  completeness,  a  comparison  of  the  CM  and  TH  stress-strain  curves  up  to  strains 

beyond failure are shown in Figure 5. Of course, the CM potentials no longer resemble the QM 

material in the large strain domain. However, it illustrates clearly that the new potential satisfies 

all  the  requirements  for  a  multi-scale  modeling  of  the  QM  rod:  accurate  near  equilibrium 

properties and less ductile elastic properties far from equilibrium.

Density Functional Theory Quantum Mechanics 

The same method for determining a CM potential was tested for the case of an underlying 

quantum mechanics determined from the density functional theory described above. In this case 

the QM calculations are considerably more time intensive so that only equilibrium and selected 

adiabatic  strain  configurations  were  calculated  for  the  QM.  The  equilibrium  structure  was 

determined by sequential DFT calculations and nuclear relaxation to find the minimum energy 

configuration.  The  strained  configurations  were  obtained  from  an  affine  transformation  of  the 

minimum energy configuration by 1, 2, 3, and 4 %, with a single DFT calculation of forces at 

each of the expanded configurations. The potential parameters were determined using this data in 

the GA, followed by scaling. Table 3 shows the resulting parameters in comparison to the TTAM 

and  BKS  parameters.    Again,  we  see  that  the  charge  on  the  ions  is  lower,  in  this  case  almost 

halved, from that found in the TTAM and BKS potentials. Also, the van der Waals interaction, 

the cij’s, are much less than in the published potentials.

III.  Conclusions 

The use of ab initio QM data to determine a corresponding CM potential for multi-scale 

modeling  has  been  illustrated  in  detail  here  for  a  non-trivial  mesoscopic  system,  the  SiO2 

nanorod.  The  objective  of  reproducing  equilibrium  structure  and  linear  elastic  properties  has 

been attained to quite good accuracy. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the method is 

not sensitive to the choice for the fundamental QM method used. The quality of the CM potential 

obtained for both the TH method and the DFT method is comparable in each case.  

Although  the  approach  proposed  here  is  to  tailor  the  potential  to  each  multi-scale 

modeling problem considered, it is tempting to ask to what extent a potential constructed for the 

nanorod is representative of other silica based systems. This kind of extrapolation must be used 

with  some  care,  and  is  not  in  the  constructive  spirit  of  the  presentation  here.  Nevertheless,  for 

practical  purposes  it  appears  that  the  nanorod  potentials  do  have  a  wider  applicability.  Two 

examples have been explored with positive preliminary results. The TH CM potential has been 

used  for  MD  simulation  of  bulk  silica  glass  properties,  such  as  thermodynamics  (density)  and 

structure  (radial  distribution  functions)  with  quite  satisfactory  results  in  comparison  with 

experimental  data  [14].  The  second  example  is  a  ten  membered  SiO2  nanoring  [15],  where 

equilibrium  structure  (bond  angles)  obtained  using  the  CM  potential  in  MD  simulation  gives 

good  agreement  with  QM  results  based  on  the  TH  method.  These  results  are  somewhat 

surprising since the local structure of the glass and nanoring are quite different from that of the 

rod.  This  suggests  a  new  phenomenology  whereby  ab  initio  data  for  a  specific  system  and 

specific properties is used to construct a classical potential, followed by an empirical exploration 

of its range of validity elsewhere. 

 

19

The  study  here  posed  the  problem  of  constructing  a  CM  potential  to  represent  the 

properties of a given approximate QM description of a system. This is separate from the question 

of  how  accurate  that  approximate  QM  description  may  be.  Consequently,  in  the  discussions 

above we have compared the CM potential obtained from TH data with the results of the TH QM 

structure and elasticity. Similarly the CM potential obtained from DFT data has been compared 

to results of DFT QM. In closing, however, it is appropriate to note that aside from any issues of 

constructing  classical  potentials  the  calculations  performed  here  at  the  QM  level  lead  to 

noticeably differences between the TH and DFT quantum rods. For example the TH rod is about 

4% longer and 2% wider than the DFT rod; the Si-O-Si bond angle in plane is about 7% larger 

for  the  TH  rod.  While  these  are  not  very  large  differences  they  lead  to  quite  different  elastic 

properties  as  shown  in  Figure  7.  This  puts  in  context  the  task  of  constructing  CM  potentials 

representing a given QM method. Generally, multi-scale modeling requires an efficient ab initio 

method  to  describe  a  mechanism  (e.g.  charge  transfer)  but  whose  absolute  accuracy  is  not 

known. Consequently, the accuracy of the CM representation is required only within this same 

tolerance.

APPENDIX – RESCALING METHOD 

The parameters of Table 1 obtained from the GA represent stable equilibrium structures, 

but these structures still differ somewhat from those of the underlying quantum TH calculation. 

To  improve  the  potential  further  new  potential  parameters  are  determined  from  these  by 

“mapping”  the  GA  structures  onto  the  correct  TH  structure  through  an  affine  scaling  of  the 

 

 

22

coordinates. Let pij = (qi, qj, aij, bij cij ) denote one set of parameters from Table 2 and let rij be the 

separation  for  the  pair  i,j  at  equilibrium.  Also,  let 

  be  the  corresponding  equilibrium 

'ijr

separation from the TH. The objective is to find a new set of parameters p’

ij for the pair potential 

such that the new equilibrium configuration is at

. 'ijr

As a first step require that the pair forces under change of parameters and rescaling of the 

separation are proportional to the original forces

The sum of the forces

This condition assures that the new parameters will yield a new equilibrium at

with the TH calculation. This is strictly true only if the r

ij and 

'ijr

 are related by the same scale 

transformation for every pair, which is observed to be approximately the case. Next, the stability 

of this new equilibrium condition is assured by the second constraint

Abstract: 
Although  Physics  is  the  same  worldwide,  students  belonging  to  different  learning  systems  as  well  as 
different  cultural  environments  may  develop  different  styles  of  approaching  and  reasoning  out  Physics 
problems. In a first experiment we compare student physics problem-solving styles between two different 
student  populations:  a  group  of  typical  American  students  (from  an  OSU  calculus-based  introductory 
course) and a group  of Romanian students (from a second-year class at Bucharest University). We discuss 
one of the problems given in a short E&M survey, in which students from both populations were presented 
with a point charge in a region containing a uniform magnetic field. We asked  students to determine the 
force on the charge for different initial conditions. In a second experiment, three American physics students 
and three Romanian physics students were given the same problem and were asked to explain loudly their 
answer to each question. Their answers were tape-recorded. Students(cid:146) answers depend on an understanding 
of  the  Lorentz  force  and  their  general  knowledge  from  classical  mechanics.  Observed  similarities  and 
differences in approach between these student groups are discussed, and our study(cid:146)s results described. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION: 
Many  papers  have  been  written  in  the  field  of  Physics  Education  (PE)  about  students(cid:146) 
misconceptions  related  to  E&M  (Ref.  1-7),  but  few  of  them  addressed  a  comparative 
study  of  students(cid:146)  answering  styles  and  Physics  level  of  students  belonging  to  different 
cultural environments and learning systems. Many misconceptions about Physics (as well 
as about any other field) are context-dependent (cid:151) depend on the learning system as well 
as the cultural environment in which Physics is taught. Even though Physics is the same 
worldwide,  we  all  know  that  the  way  students  assimilate  Physics  in  different  countries 
could vary quite considerable.  
 
For example, some learning systems could put a lot of emphasis on multiple-choice type 
questions (MC-questions/MC-learning system), as American learning system does, while 
others, as some European countries do, on open-ended type questions (OE-questions/OE-
learning system). Some countries introduce high level Physics classes at very early stages 
during  student(cid:146)s  studies  (cid:151)  as  is  the  case  in  most  of  the  Eastern  European  countries, 
China, etc. (cid:151) while others, as Americans do, postpone the introduction of high difficulty 
Physics classes until students reach university.  
 
Also, some learning systems put a lot of emphasis on home-works, team-works, and high 
volume  of  work  in  general  (cid:151)  as  is  the  case  with the  American  learning  system,  where 
Physics  major  students,  during  their  undergraduate  studies  are  kept  busy  with  weekly 
home-works  and  projects  (cid:151)  while  other  learning  systems  allow  students  to  be  more

relaxed during their studies, the  volume of  home-works, projects, team-works, assigned 
etc. being much smaller (as is the case of Romanian learning system).             
 
As the above examples  illustrate a lot of things could  be different  in the  context within 
which  students,  belonging  to  different  environments  and  learning  systems,  assimilate 
physics.  Because  of  these  different  conditions  under  which  students  study  Physics  in 
different countries we decided to do this comparison research to study in more detail the 
similarities  and  differences  between  two  student populations  belonging  to two  different 
countries.  Because  the  two  authors  of  this  paper  belong  to  two  different  countries 
(Aubrecht  to  US,  and  Raduta  to  Romania),  we  chose  for  comparison  two  student 
populations from US and Romania.         
 
II. RESULTS 
In a first experiment a short E&M survey was given to two student populations, one from 
a  large  midwestern university recently  involved  in winning a  national athletic title (The 
Ohio  State  University,  Columbus)  and  the  other  one  from  the  largest  university  in 
Romania (Bucharest University, Bucharest). The American student population consisted 
of  74  American  students  most  of  them  being  sophomores  majoring  in  electrical-  and 
mechanical-engineering,  and  in  computer  science.  The  other  group  was  formed  of  52 
Romanian students in the second year, all majoring in Physics.  
 
The survey consisted of two problems, one of them being presented in Table 2.1. In this 
problem we wanted to test the  ideas of  how students  in the two countries  view the way 
charges interact with magnetic fields. Even though the number of students that have taken 
the  survey  is  not  statistically  significant  (only  52  Romanian  students  and  74  American 
students) we can still observe some similarities and differences between these two student 
populations.

In  tables  2.2,  2.3,  2.4  and  2.5  could  be  seen  the  results  obtained  by  the  two  student 
populations.  The  results  drawn  from  this  problem  are  pretty  alarming  especially  if  we 
take  into  account that this  two-question  survey  (cid:151)  with  two  easy  standard  problems  (cid:151) 
was given just two weeks before the end of the quarter, when one would expect students 
to  be  pretty  comfortable  with  the  main  concepts  of  E&M  (Note:  we  discussed  only  the 
magnetic  field  problem  here.  We  also  asked  a  Gauss(cid:146)  Law  problem).  In  table  2.6  we 
present another way of examining their answers function of the number of words used in 
answering question c). 
  
Observations: 
Some  students (both  Americans  and Romanians)  seem to not know what the difference 
between  a  scalar  and  a  vector  is,  misconception  well  documented  in  physics  education 
research (PER). In many cases, students would have a scalar in one side of the equation 
and a vector (or a vector product) in the other side. Even if a student made this mistake 
we decided to include him as having a correct answer (if everything else was correct). 

Even  we  instructed  all  the  students  to  be  as  explicit  as  possible  when  answering  their 
questions (cid:151) to use (cid:147)words(cid:148) instead of just a few formulas (cid:151) a lot of American students 
just wrote some formulas.

The  trajectory  question  seemed  to  be  pretty  difficult  for  most  of  the  students  (both 
Americans  and  Romanians).  Only  7%  of  the  American  students  and  25%  of  the 
Romanian  students  realized  that  a  charged  particle  coming  into  a  magnetic  field  with  a 
velocity  perpendicular  on  the  field  will  have  a  circular  motion.  These  results  are 
consistent with the findings of Bagno et al.(cid:146)s (Ref 4).  
 
None  of  the  American  students  gave  a  correct  answer  for the trajectory  (a  spiral)  when 
the charged particle is coming under an angle ≠ 90 degrees in a magnetic field; only 10 
Romanian students (19.2%) identified correctly the trajectory as being a spiral.  
 
For  question  a),  even  it  was  very  easy  to  find  the  right  trajectory,  only  43%  of  the 
American  students  and  36.5%  of  the  Romanian  students  gave  the  correct  answer.  The 
same happened with the trajectory question from part b) which was slightly more difficult 
than that from part a). Only 32% of the American students and 46.1.% of the Romanian 
students realized that a particle with initial velocity v will have a straight line trajectory if 
no force will act on it.  
 
These  results  point  again  to  the  difficulty  of  the  students  to  deal  simultaneously  with 
concepts from both Mechanics and E&M that is well documented in other studies (Ref. 4, 
7, 8).          
 
A  lot  of  the  students  (mostly  Americans)  wrote  the  Lorentz  force  correctly  up  to  the 
electric charge q. 

When trying to get the direction of the force, most of them (Americans) were talking like: 
(cid:147)the  direction  can  be  found  using  the  right-hand  rule.(cid:148)  But  we  haven(cid:146)t  seen  one 
statement talking about vector product. It seems that American students are used more to 
the  right  hand  rule,  while  Romanian  students  more  to  the  vector  product.  None  of  the 
Romanian students had any statement related to the right hand rule.     

 

 

III. STYLE ANALYSIS 
In  Table  3.1  bellow  we  present  two  representative  (cid:147)good  answers(cid:148)  from  two  students 
from the two populations considered in the first experiment. As one can easily see, their 
answers look very different. While the Romanian student (whose answer was presented) 
is  writing  more  words,  trying  to  be  as  explicit  as  he  can  answering  each  question,  the 
American student is very brief in his answers, writing mostly formulas (and this held true 
to  a  great  extent  for  most  Romanian  and  American  students  who  gave  reasonable  good 
answers  for  the  problems).  Looking  at  American  student(cid:146)s  answer  we  notice  that  he(cid:146)s 
trying to be as concise and direct as possible, leaving away unnecessary words that could 
easily be implied -- as in the statement, (cid:148) ┴ to magnetic field(cid:148), that clearly means that the 
trajectory of the particle is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. In fact, as 
one  can  see  in  Table  3.1  bellow,  the  American  student  is  using  basically  the  minimum 
number  of  formulas,  words  or  symbols  necessary  for  answering  each  question  (and 
justifying an answer), while the Romanian student is trying to explain in words each step 
in the reasoning process needed for solving the problem.

On  the  other  hand,  analyzing  the  student  category  from  each  population,  who  didn(cid:146)t 
know  how  to  answer  a  question,  American  students  seemed  to  have  more  courage 
(confidence)  in  approaching  the  questions,  throwing  on  the  paper  some  words  or 
formulas  (even  though  not  necessarily  related  to  the  questions),  while  most  of  the 
Romanian students from this category left the page blank. 
   
TABLE 3.1 
Romanian student representative (good) answer: 
a) The magnetic force for a charge in an uniform field is: f=qvxB. If v=0, than f=0, and it will not be accelerated in the 
field, hence we can(cid:146)t speak of direction of the force, but we can say that the magnitude is always zero.  
 
b) v║B, v≠0, f=qvxB=qvBsinα; v║B=0→ α=0 →sinα=0; →f=0; Hence the trajectory is a straight line parallel the lines 
of magnetic field. The equation of the motion will be: 

                                                                x=x(0)+vt, where v=ct. 

c) if v┴ B, then α=90, sinα =1. The trajectory of the particle will be a circle perpendicular to the magnetic field lines. 
The magnitude of the force is f=qvB, and the direction is that of the radius of the circle pointing towards the center of 
the circle. 

 

 

d)  (cid:139)(v;B)=α, is the superposition of the two previous cases, and the trajectory of the particle will be a helicoidal one, 
with parameters radius and step: 
                                                                step=v(║) T; radius=f(v(┴); m) 

where  m is the  mass  of  the  particle.  The  magnitude  of  the  magnetic  force  is  f=qvBsinα  and the  direction  is always 
perpendicular to the trajectory.  
 
American student representative (good) answer: 
a) F(L)=qvxB; if v=0, then F(L)=0;         ┴to magnetic field 
b) F(L)=qvxB=qvBsinӨ =qvxBsin0=0;           across magnetic field 
c) F(L)=qvxB=qvBsinӨ =qvBsin90=qvB,          ┴ to v and B; 
d) F(L)=qvBsinӨ; ┴ to v and B,        ┴ to v and B 

In  a  second  experiment  (that  was  done  in  Romania)  three  American  students  and  three 
Romanian  students  were  interviewed  and  tape-recorded  in  the  same  time.  They  were 
asked to explain loudly the solution to each part of the problem from Table 2.1, trying to 
observe  style  differences  between  these  two  small  student  populations.  The  results  for 
part c) are presented in Table 4.7 bellow.

The  results  from  the  videotaped  interviews  do  not  contradict  the  results  obtained  in  the 
written  survey.  As  in  the  written  surveys,  American  students  seem  to  be  overall  more 
confident  on  their  answers  than  Romanian  students  did,  answering  each  question  using 
smaller  number  of  words  than  their  omologs  from  Romania.  Also,  American  students 
seemed  to  be  more  focused  ((cid:147)pure  activity  mode(cid:148)  vs.  (cid:147)mixed  activity  mode(cid:148))  on  the 
interview  than  Romanian  students  did,  talking  fewer  times  during  the  interview  about 
something else not related with the interview.      
 
 
IV) POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THE STYLE DIFFERENCES  
In trying to understand the differences in styles of these two student populations, we have 
to examine the cultural and learning system differences under which these students have 
been exposed during their lifetime.  
 
Cultural differences   
i) Even though the two countries have a lot of cultural similarities, (cid:151) American culture 
vs. European countries(cid:146) cultures  being  much  more similar than US or European culture 
vs.  Asian  countries(cid:146)  cultures  or  any  other  part  of  the  world  (cid:151)  there  are  still  some 
important differences that could  be reflected also in their problem solving styles.  While 
American  Anglo-Saxon  culture  is  a  mature  business-oriented  one  in  which  efficiency, 
strict  rules  and  highly  specialized  professionals  are  highly  desired,  Romanian  Latin 
culture is quite different from this point of view, having a quite different path of history, 
habits  and  social  interactions.  The  rhythm  of  life  in  a  faced  paced  business-oriented 
enviroment in which the expression (cid:147)time is money(cid:148) is quite representative for the whole 
culture is quite different from the one from Romania or other East European countries.        
 
Learning system 
ii) The two countries(cid:146) learning systems are also quite different: 
 
a)  While in Romania a big number of classes of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry are 
taught in  most High-Schools,  in US  few High-Schools deliver such classes,  for  most of 
American  students  the  first  advanced  classes  of  Physics  being  taken  in  University.  We 
believe  this  is  an  important  factor  that  could  be  directly  correlated  with  business 
rationales. 
  

b)  While  in  Romania,  and  most  European  countries  the  university  studies  are  basically 
free (or almost free), in US college education could cost quite a lot, especially if you are 
an  out-of-state  student.  This  is  also  an  important  difference  between  the  two  learning 

 

6

systems  which  brings  a  business  component  into  the  learning  process.  (cid:147)Learning(cid:148) 
((cid:147)knowledge(cid:148))  becomes  like  a  business  package  product  ready  for  sale  for  the  annual 
tuition. For example, for an out-of state student at OSU the tuition is around 20,000$/yr. 
while  at  Bucharest  University  you  pay  just  some  symbolic  taxes  (around  30$/yr.). This 
has two important consequences:  
        
1)  Students  have  less  time  for  studying  (or  less  leisure  time),  because  a  lot  of  them,  in 
order to be able to pay the tuition and other living expenses, are forced to work part-time 
besides school.             
 
2)  There  is  a  psychological  subtle  effect  involved  because  of  this  big  tuition  American 
students  have  to  pay  (and  implicitly  loans  to  be  paid  back).  The  learning  process  is 
transformed  into  an  initial  (business)  investment  that  should  bring  a  good  return 
(material)  in  the  long-run.  This  forces  the  students  to  become  more  efficient  at  their 
exams  ((cid:147)check-ers(cid:148)),  being  more  interested  in  taking  good  grades  than  in  really 
understanding and thinking at the knowledge they have been learning.   
 
3)  One  feature  of  the  American  learning  system  seen  in  primary  school  through  the 
university level (and, for many fields of study, even at the graduate level) is an emphasis 
on multiple-choice (MC) questions. Among the other global learning systems, Americans 
seem  uniquely  reliant  on  MC  questions.  Most  other  learning  systems,  including 
Romanian one, do use the MC questions to some extent (cid:151) in  many cases  imitating the 
American system (cid:151) but few use them to the same extent as they are used in the US.  
 
Many papers have been written about the use of the MC questions in PER (Ref. 9-12) and 
in  education  research  in  other  areas.  In  most  of  them,  the  researchers  were  working  to 
develop  effective  multiple-choice  tests  intended  to  be  able  to  evaluate  and  compare 
instructions  that  are  delivered  to  large  populations.  The  question  of  which  sort  of  test 
(objective, essay, etc.) to use during exams has been discussed by many authors (see, for 
example, Refs. 13-16). There have been both, emotional and substantive appeals for the 
use  of  objective  tests,  and  equally  forceful  statements  opposed  to  objective  tests.    We 
believe that, if wisely combined and designed, both types of tests can be very useful.  
 
Among  other  consequences  that  might  have,  if  used  extensively,  MC  questions  help 
students  feel  more  confident  of  their  (cid:147)knowledge(cid:148)  (cid:151)  a  paradox!  (cid:151)  eliminating  the 
confusion and uncertainty in choosing from among many other potential answers (created 
or memorized). For a MC question, on an exam, there is clearly only one correct answer, 
which  must be among those written down  by the  instructor. Once  it  is chosen, that(cid:146)s  it, 
the  mental  check-off  is  done,  the  job  completely  finished.  The  student  can  confidently 
move on to the next question. In the long-run, this could contribute to the self-confidence 
and  transparency  (and  sometimes  obstinacy  and  unwillingness  to  listen)  many  find 
characteristic of American culture; and our findings are consistent with this.

CONCLUSSIONS  
In this paper we analyzed some of the style differences in approaching and reasoning out 
Physics  problems,  students  belonging  to  different  cultural  environments  or  learning 
systems might develop. Even though, in terms of the physics answers they gave, the two 
student populations considered are very similar (cid:150) American doing  slightly  better (cid:150) their 
styles  differ  quite  considerable.  While  Romanian  students  wrote  more  words than  their 
omologs from US, trying to explain in words each step in the reasoning process needed to 
answer  each  question,  American  students  were  very  brief  and  concise  in  their  answers. 
During  the  videotaped  interviews,  Romanian  students  talked  more,  made  more  gesture 
and seemed less confident in their answers than their American homologues. In the same 
time,  American  students  seemed  to  be  more  focused  on  the  interview  than  Romanian 
students did, talking very few times during  the interview about something else than what 
were  expected.  So,  they  seem  to  be  more  result-driven  than  their  collegues  from

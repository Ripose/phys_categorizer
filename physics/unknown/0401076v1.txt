Abstract:  We  study  the  dispersion  and  leakage  properties  for  the  recently
reported low-loss photonic band-gap fiber by Smith et al. [Nature 424, 657
(2003)]. We find that surface modes have a significant impact on both the
dispersion and leakage properties of the fundamental mode. Our dispersion
results  are  in  quantitative  agreement  with  the  dispersion  profile  reported
recently by Ouzounov et al. [Science 301, 1702 (2003)] though our results
suggest  that  the  observed  long-wavelength  anomalous  dispersion  is  due  to
an avoided crossing (with surface modes) rather than band-bending caused
by the photonic band-gap boundary of the cladding.

1. Introduction

Silica-air  micro-structured  optical  fibers  are  generally  attracting  a  considerable  interest
because of their novel and unique optical properties (for recent reviews we refer to Ref. [1]
and  references  therein)  and  the  discovery  of  photonic  band-gap  (PBG)  fibers  [2,  3]  has  in
particular strongly stimulated  the strive for  a low-loss PBG fiber with also  a low  dispersion
and a high power threshold for non-linearities. Recently, a PBG fiber with a loss down to 13
dB/km  at  1500  nm  was  achieved  [4]  and  this  fiber  was  also  found  to  have  very  unusual
dispersion properties [5].

From  a  modeling  point-of-view  the  fiber  structures  have  usually  been  considered  ideal
with  circular  air-holes  but  in  order  to  model  realistic  PBG  structures  with  large  air-filling
fractions one has  to  go beyond  the circular representation.  Experimentally,  the  cladding  air-
holes tend to be non-circular with a close-to-hexagonal shape at large air-filling fractions [4, 6,
7]. Recently, this was taken into account in a study of the PBGs in the cladding structures [8]
and the results were found to be in excellent agreement with the cladding PBG reported in Ref.
[4]. In this paper we extend the approach to a study of guided modes in the full fiber structure.
We  use  a  finite-element  approach  which  allows  us  to  calculate  both  dispersion  and
confinement  properties [9] in a structure corresponding to that in Ref. [4], see Fig. 1. The role
of confined surface modes has been debated and it has been suggested that a large part of the
present loss level may be attributed to coupling of power to the surface modes [4]. Our results
confirm the existence of surface modes and we also find that their presence strongly affects
the  dispersion  properties  of  the  fundamental  mode  via  so-called  avoided  crossings  of  the
photonic bands. We find finger prints of avoided crossings in the leakage loss as well as in the
group-velocity dispersion (GVD) which agrees quantitatively with measurements [5].

2. Full-vector finite-element approach

We use the full-vector finite-element approach described in detail in Ref. [9] and references
therein. Here, we briefly list the most important definitions. For a given frequency ω = ck =
c2π/λ  (where  c  is  velocity  of  light,  and  k  and  λ  are  the  free-space  wavenumber  and
wavelength, respectively) the numerical calculation provides us with a complex propagation
constant  γ(ω)  =  β(ω)  +  iα(ω)  where  β  is  the  usual  propagation  constant  of  the  plane-wave
along  the  fiber  axis  and  α  is  the  attenuation  constant  associated  with  the  exponential  decay
along  the  fiber  axis.  We  present  the  photonic  bands  by  their  mode-index  β/k  and  the
attenuation on a dB-scale by 20 × log10(e) × α ≅ 8.686 × α. The group-velocity dispersion is
expressed  by  the  dispersion-parameter 
  is  the  group
velocity.

3. Dielectric structure

For  the  cladding  structure  we  use  the  recently  proposed  two-parameter  representation  [8]
shown  in  the  lower  left  panel  of  Fig.  1,  where  the  air-holes  are  hexagons  (edge-to-edge
distance  d)  with  curved  corners  (curvature  dc).  For  a  triangular  arrangement  the  air-filling
fraction is given by

where Λ is the pitch. The hexagon-edges are tangents to circles defining the rounding of the
corners so that the glass-air interface has no kinks and is smooth and well-defined.

The structure in Ref. [4] has Λ ≅ 4.7 µm and f ≅ 0.94 and by trial-and-error we find that
d/Λ = 0.98 and dc/Λ = 0.44 generates a structure which resembles the experimental structure
surprisingly well, see Fig. 1. For the core we use the model shown in the lower middle panel
of Fig. 1. Again, we start from a hexagon with rounded corners (curvature Dc), but in this case
the hexagon-edges are not tangents to circles defining the rounding of the corners. To ensure a
smooth and well-defined glass-air interface without unphysical kinks we introduce additional
rounding (curvature Dc’) giving rise to small concave surface sections (when observed from
the  glass  side  of  the  interface).  When  this  core  structure  is  superimposed  on  the  cladding
structure (we consider the situation when the core is formed by removing 7 air holes from the
cladding  structure),  six  of  the  neighboring  air-holes  turn  from  hexagons  to  pentagons  with
rounded corners (curvatures dc and dc’), see lower right panel in Fig. 1. By trial-and-error we
find that D = 14.0 µm and Dc = 0.59D, Dc’ = 0.202D, and dc’/Λ = 0.1 results in a core region
very similar to the real core in Ref. [4].

For the dielectric properties of the hybrid air-silica structure we use the refractive index n
=  1  for  the  air  regions  and  n  =  1.45  for  the  silica  regions.  Neglecting  the  frequency
dependence  of  the  latter  amounts  to  neglecting  material  dispersion  which  is  somewhat
justified for the fundamental mode which is mainly localized in the air-core region. Care must
however be taken when the fraction of field-energy in silica increases [10].

Fig.  2.    In  the  upper  panel  the  effective  index  versus  wavelength  plot  illustrates  the
hybridization  and  avoided-crossings  for  guided  air-core  modes  (low  slope  curves)  and  silica-
surface  modes  (steep  curves).  Field  plots  around  the  avoided  crossings  are  shown  in  Fig.  3.
Lower  panel  shows  confinement  loss  versus  wavelength  for  the  fundamental-like  mode  with
PBG  boundaries  and  avoided  crossings  indicated  by  dashed  lines.  The  BPG  boundaries  are
calculated for an infinite periodic lattice of the cladding holes.

4. Numerical results

In the upper panel of Fig. 2 we show the mode index of modes localized to the air-core
region  and  the  surrounding  silica  surface.  We  find  that  the  cladding  PBG  confines  two
degenerated fundamental modes [11, 12] and four nearly degenerated high-order modes with a
different  polarization  to  the  air-core  region.  In  the  mode-index  representation  all  of  these
modes have photonic bands which are very flat as a consequence of a very small overlap with
the silica. However, the PBG and the core shape also support surface modes. Since the surface
modes are tightly confined to very small silica regions the corresponding photonic bands are
rather steep (compared to the air-core modes) and having two different classes of modes (with
steep and flat slopes) very often leads to hybridization and avoided crossings of the modes. In

other  words  the  eigenmodes  of  the  system  become  linear  combinations  of  the  bare  air-core
and surface modes. In the mode-index plot the avoided crossings are clearly seen (note that in
some cases crossings are allowed for symmetry reasons). In Fig. 3 we show contour plots of
the modes at different points near the avoided crossings. As seen from panels A, D, and G the
upper-most, almost flat, index curve corresponds to a fundamental-like mode mainly localized
in  the  air-core  region.  In  the  same  way  we  find  that  the  other,  almost  flat,  index  curves
correspond to high-order modes also confined to the core region (fields not shown). For the
steep index curves panels B, C, E, and F clearly illustrate their surface-mode nature. As seen
the surface modes are supported by the glass region surrounding the air-core and we believe
that  a  smaller  amount  of  glass  near  the  core  is  a  possible  direction  for  suppressing  the
presence of surface modes.

In the lower panel of Fig. 2 we show the confinement loss for the fundamental-like mode
in the case of a structure with 6 rings of air holes. As seen, the attenuation spectrum carries
strong  finger  prints  of  the  avoided  crossings  (indicated  by  black  dashed  lines)  and  similar
finger prints can be expected in a scattering loss spectrum because the beat-length between the
fundamental mode and the cladding and/or surface modes also carries information about the
avoided crossings.

We  also  note  that  the  confinement  loss  increases  toward  the  high-wavelength  PBG
boundary which agrees with the experimental observation in Ref. [4], though in experiments
there  are  additional  contributions  from  scattering  loss  and  coupling  of  power  to  the  surface
modes. In general confinement loss of course increases in the vicinity of PBG edges. However,
the  strong  increase  in  confinement  loss  upon  hybridization  with  the  surface  modes  also
indicates that the bare surface modes are leakier than the bare air-core modes. We believe the
origin  is  at  least  two-fold:  i)  the  surface  modes  are  more  tightly  confined  than  the  air-core
modes which results in a somewhat higher numerical aperture (like high-order air-core modes,
their  Fourier  transforms  have  large  transverse  k-components)  and  ii)  the  surface  modes  are
localized closer to the homogeneous glass region surrounding the PBG cladding.

In Fig. 4 we show the GVD for the fundamental mode which has zero dispersion around
λ  ≅  1.450  µm  in  reasonable  agreement  with  the  experimental  result  λ  ~  1.425  µm  [5].  The
GVD  is  normal  at  the  short-wavelength  PBG  boundary  and  toward  the  long-wavelength
regime  it  becomes  anomalous  and  in  Ref.  [5]  this  behavior  was  suggested  to  be  a  typical
Kramers-Kronig-like  phenomena.  In  our  simulations  we  find  that  the  anomalous  dispersion
arises  as  a  consequence  of  an  avoided  crossing  with  a  surface  mode  rather  than  the  long-
wavelength PBG boundary of the cladding. It should be noted that in the experiments in Ref.
[5]  it  is  quite  likely  that  some  linear  combination  of  hybrid  air-core  and  surface  modes  is
excited rather than just the fundamental air-core mode. This makes the interpretation difficult
and a direct quantitative comparison to our calculation of the fundamental eigenmode GVD is
only  reasonable  when  the  wavelength  is  not  too  close  to  neither  the  PBG  edges  nor  the
avoided-crossings.

5. Conclusion

We have studied the dispersion and leakage properties of the PBG fiber in Ref. [4, 5] by aid of
a finite-element approach [9] and the recently proposed two-parameter representation for the
air-holes in the cladding [8] as well as for the air-core. Our simulations support the existence
of surface modes as well as high-order modes in the air-core. We have studied the dispersion
and  leakage  properties  of  the  fundamental  mode  and  found  that  the  surface  modes  have  a
strong  impact  on  these  properties.  Our  results  also  illustrate  how  the  presence  of  surface
modes prevents broad-band transmission (over the full PBG of the cladding) with low group-
velocity  dispersion.  On  the  other  hand,  the  surface  modes  facilitate  strong  anomalous
dispersion (via avoided crossings) which may find use in novel applications [5, 7]. While our
quantitative observations may not be universal we believe that the qualitative behavior is quite
general;  when  surface  modes  are  present  it  is  very  likely  that  they  strongly  modify  the
dispersion, leakage loss, and scattering loss of the bare air-core modes.

Abstract

Given  the  difficulty  of  obtaining  compact  analytical  solutions  for  diffusion  of
interacting geminate pairs (such as electron-hole pairs generated by ionization of liquid)
it is common, following the original method of Mozumder, to "prescribe" this diffusion.
With this approach, the survival probability of the pair is represented as a product of the
survival probability for a freely diffusing pair and a suitably defined weighting function.
This approach gives the correct limiting survival probability for a pair in the Coulomb
field. The same approach was used for simulation of reaction dynamics in radiolytic spurs
("independent  reaction  times"  approach  of  Pimblott)  and  solve  other  vexing  diffusion
problems  that  do  not  have  analytical  solution.  A  reasonable  question  is,  can  the  same
method be used for any other interaction potential than Coulomb? Here we demonstrate
that such a prescription is generally impossible. The correct result given by the prescribed
diffusion approach for the Coulomb potential is, actually, purely accidental. The method
is inherently contradictory and it should be used with caution.

Dissociation, ionization, and electron photodetachemnt frequently yield geminate

pairs in which the partners recombine and interact with each other. [1,2] Even when such

pairs are isolated (in radiolysis, several pairs may overlap forming a spur) their dynamics

are fairly complex [3,4,5]. The simulation of these dynamics (given the multitude of other

processes) is, therefore, difficult and cumbersome as compact analytical expressions do

not  exist  and  Monte  Carlo  or  numerical  methods  should  be  used.  [1]  The  situation

becomes even more involved for multiple-pair spurs. A practical solution to this vexing

problem are approximate methods based on "prescribing" the diffusion (see below). The

method was originally suggested by Mozumder [6,7]; similar ideas and approaches form

the basis of more complex models, e.g., the popular IRT model developed by Pimblott for

simulation  of  water  spurs.  [8]  Mozumder  demonstrated [6]  that  for  geminate  partners

migrating in the Coulomb field of each other the "prescribed" diffusion yields the same

limiting  survival  probability  as  the  exact  theory.  [3,5]  When  the  pair  is  placed  in  the

external electric field, the approximate solution given by the "prescribed diffusion" [7] is

still reasonably close to the exact one. [3]

Does this recipe work for an arbitrary interaction potential? For example, for a

mean  field  potential  that  is  different  from  the  Coulomb  potential?  Why  does  the

"prescribed diffusion" approach gives the correct answer for the Coulomb potential? Is

this  approach  correct?  Does  it  yield  reasonable  asymptotic  behavior?  Given  that  the

methods  based  on  this  "prescribed  diffusion"  approach  are  widely  used  to  simulate

complex dynamics in spurs, it is instructive to go back to the simplest case and find the

answers to these questions.

reduced to eq. (18) for any potential except for the Coulomb potential.

It is easy to see that the failure of the "prescribed diffusion" method is conceptual

rather than mathematical, because eq. (2) does not have the commutation symmetry of

the accurate solution. The solution of eq. (1) has the general property [5] that

(compare with  eq. (12)). The survival probabilities given by eqs. (17) and (22) should be

.  In  other  words,  the  only  potential  for  which  the  "prescribed

diffusion"  yields  the  correct  estimate  for  the  limiting  survival  probability  is  Coulomb

potential. Furthermore, the correct answer obtained using this method for the Coulomb

potential is purely accidental. The problem goes all the way back to eq. (2) of which eq.

(22) is the immediate consequence. We conclude that eq. (2) does not generally hold: it is

impossible  to  find  a  suitable  function  Ω r t0,

(

)  which  approximates  the  exact  solution,

even at infinitely  long delay time. This, in turn, means that the "prescription approach"

does not generally work.

In  conclusion,  the  prescribed  diffusion  approach  does  not  work  even  for  small

deviations  from  the  Coulomb  potential.  For  the  latter,  the  correct  answer  is  obtained

accidentally.  Thus,  extreme  care  should  be  exercised  when  "prescribed  diffusion"

approaches are used.

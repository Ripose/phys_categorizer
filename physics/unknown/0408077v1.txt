The book show that following Poincar´e and Minkowski
the essence and the main content of the relativity theory are that
space and time form an indivisible four-dimensional continuum
of events with the pseudo-Euclidean geometry.
It is this four-
dimensional space where all physics processes take their course.
The book is supplied with the comments on the theme on the
works and views by L. de Broglie, P. Dirac, A. Einstein, V.L. Ginz-
burg, S. Goldberg, P. Langevin, H. Lorentz, L.I. Mandel’stam,
G. Minkowski, A. Pais, W. Pauli, M. Planck, A. Sommerfeld,
H. Weyl. According to the book, it was not only A. Einstein who
created the special relativity theory but to a greater extent the idea
is bound to A. Poincar´e.

The book is designed for scientiﬁc workers, post-graduates

and upper-year students majoring in theoretical physics.

Preface

The special theory of relativity “resulted from the joint efforts
of a group of great researchers – Lorentz, Poincar´e, Einstein,
Minkowski” (Max Born).

“Both Einstein, and Poincar´e, relied on the preparatory works
of H.A. Lorentz, who came very close to the ﬁnal result, but was
not able to make the last decisive step. In the coincidence of re-
sults independently obtained by Einstein and Poincar´e I see the
profound sense of harmony of the mathematical method and the
analysis, performed with the aid of thought experiments based
on the entire set of data from physical experiments”. (W. Pauli,
1955.).

H. Poincar´e, being based upon the relativity principle formu-
lated by him for all physical phenomena and upon the Lorentz
work, has discovered and formulated everything that composes the
essence of the special theory of relativity. A. Einstein was coming
to the theory of relativity from the side of relativity principle for-
mulated earlier by H. Poincar´e. At that he relied upon ideas by
H. Poincar´e on deﬁnition of the simultaneity of events occurring
in different spatial points by means of the light signal. Just for this
reason he introduced an additional postulate – the constancy of the
velocity of light. This book presents a comparison of the article by
A. Einstein of 1905 with the articles by H. Poincar´e and clariﬁes
what is the new content contributed by each of them. Somewhat
later H. Minkowski further developed Poincar´e’s approach. Since
Poincar´e’s approach was more general and profound, our presen-
tation will precisely follow Poincar´e.

4

According to Poincar´e and Minkowski, the essence of relativ-
ity theory consists in the following: the special theory of relativ-
ity is the pseudo-Euclidean geometry of space-time. All phys-
ical processes take place just in such a space-time. The conse-
quences of this postulate are energy-momentum and angular mo-
mentum conservation laws, the existence of inertial reference sys-
tems, the relativity principle for all physical phenomena, Lorentz
transformations, the constancy of velocity of light in Galilean co-
ordinates of the inertial frame, the retardation of time, the Lorentz
contraction, the possibility to exploit non-inertial reference sys-
tems, the clock paradox, the Thomas precession, the Sagnac ef-
fect, and so on. Series of fundamental consequences have been
obtained on the base of this postulate and the quantum notions,
and the quantum ﬁeld theory has been constructed. The preser-
vation (form-invariance) of physical equations in all inertial ref-
erence systems mean that all physical processes taking place in
these systems under the same conditions are identical. Just for
this reason all natural etalons are the same in all inertial refer-
ence systems.

1. Euclidean geometry

In the third century BC Euclid published a treatise on math-
ematics, the “Elements”, in which he summed up the preceding
development of mathematics in antique Greece. It was precisely
in this work that the geometry of our three-dimensional space –
Euclidean geometry – was formulated.

This happened to be a most important step in the development
of both mathematics and physics. The point is that geometry ori-
ginated from observational data and practical experience, i. e.
it arose via the study of Nature. But, since all natural phenom-
ena take place in space and time, the importance of geometry for
physics cannot be overestimated, and, moreover, geometry is ac-
tually a part of physics.

In the modern language of mathematics the essence of Eu-
clidean geometry is determined by the Pythagorean theorem.
In accordance with the Pythagorean theorem, the distance of a
point with Cartesian coordinates x, y, z from the origin of the re-
ference system is determined by the formula

ℓ2 = x2 + y2 + z2,

(1.1)

or in differential form, the distance between two inﬁnitesimally
close points is

(dℓ)2 = (dx)2 + (dy)2 + (dz)2.

(1.2)

Here dx, dy, dz are differentials of the Cartesian coordinates. Usu-
ally, proof of the Pythagorean theorem is based on Euclid’s ax-
ioms, but it turns out to be that it can actually be considered a
deﬁnition of Euclidean geometry. Three-dimensional space, de-
termined by Euclidean geometry, possesses the properties of ho-
mogeneity and isotropy. This means that there exist no singular

6

1. Euclidean geometry

points or singular directions in Euclidean geometry. By perform-
ing transformations of coordinates from one Cartesian reference
system, x, y, z, to another, x′, y′, z′, we obtain

ℓ2 = x2 + y2 + z2 = x′2 + y′2 + z′2.

(1.3)

This means that the square distance ℓ2 is an invariant, while its
projections onto the coordinate axes are not. We especially note
this obvious circumstance, since it will further be seen that such a
situation also takes place in four-dimensional space-time, so, con-
sequently, depending on the choice of reference system in space-
time the projections onto spatial and time axes will be relative.
Hence arises the relativity of time and length. But this issue will
be dealt with later.

Euclidean geometry became a composite part of Newtonian
mechanics. For about two thousand years Euclidean geometry was
thought to be the unique and unchangeable geometry, in spite of
the rapid development of mathematics, mechanics, and physics.

It was only at the beginning of the 19-th century that the
Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky made
the revolutionary step – a new geometry was constructed – the
Lobachevsky geometry. Somewhat later it was discovered by
the Hungarian mathematician Bolyai.

About 25 years later Riemannian geometries were developed
by the German mathematician Riemann. Numerous geometrical
constructions arose. As new geometries came into being the is-
sue of the geometry of our space was raised. What kind was it?
Euclidean or non-Euclidean?

7

2. Classical Newtonian mechanics

All natural phenomena proceed in space and time. Precisely for
this reason, in formulating the laws of mechanics in the 17-th cen-
tury, Isaac Newton ﬁrst of all deﬁned these concepts:

“Absolute Space, in its own nature, without regard
to any thing external, remains always similar and im-
moveable”.

“Absolute, True, and Mathematical Time, of it self,
and from its own nature ﬂows equably without regard
to any thing external, and by another name is called
Duration”.

As the geometry of three-dimensional space Newton actually
applied Euclidean geometry, and he chose a Cartesian reference
system with its origin at the center of the Sun, while its three axes
were directed toward distant stars. Newton considered precisely
such a reference system to be “motionless”. The introduction of
absolute motionless space and of absolute time turned out to be
extremely fruitful at the time.

The ﬁrst law of mechanics, or the law of inertia, was formu-

lated by Newton as follows:

“Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of
uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled
to change that state by forces impressed thereon”.

The law of inertia was ﬁrst discovered by Galileo. If, in motion-
less space, one deﬁnes a Cartesian reference system, then, in ac-
cordance with the law of inertia, a solitary body will move along
a trajectory determined by the following equations:

x = vxt,

y = vyt,

z = vzt.

(2.1)

8

2. Classical Newtonian mechanics

Here, vx, vy, vz are the constant velocity projections, their values
may, also, be equal to zero.

In the book “Science and Hypothesis” H. Poincar´e formu-

lated the following general principle:

“The acceleration of a body depends only on the
positions of the body and of adjacent bodies and on
their velocities. A mathematician would say that the
motions of all material particles of the Universe are
determined by second-order differential equations.

To clarify that we are here dealing with a natural
generalization of the law of inertia, I shall permit my-
self to mention an imaginary case. Above, I pointed
out that the law of inertia is not our `a priori inherent
attribute; other laws would be equally consistent with
the principle of sufﬁcient foundation. When no force
acts on a body, one could imagine its position or ac-
celeration to remain unchangeable, instead of its ve-
locity.

Thus, imagine for a minute, that one of these two
hypothetical laws is actually a law of Nature and that
it occupies the place of our law of inertia. What would
its natural generalization be? Upon thinking it over
for a minute, we shall ﬁnd out.

In the ﬁrst case it would be necessary to consider
the velocity of the body to depend only on its position
and on the position of adjacent bodies; in the second
– that a change in acceleration of the body depends
only on the positions of the body and of adjacent bod-
ies, on their velocities and on their accelerations.

Or, using the language of mathematics, the diffe-
rential equations of motion would be in the ﬁrst case
of the ﬁrst order, and in the second case – of the third
order”.

2. Classical Newtonian mechanics

Newton formulated the second law of mechanics as follows:

“The alteration of motion is ever proportional to
the motive force impressed; and is made in the di-
rection of the right line in which that force is impressed”.

And, ﬁnally, the Newton’s third law of mechanics:

“To every Action there is always opposed an equal
Reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon
each other are always equal, and directed to contrary
parts”.

On the basis of these laws of mechanics, in the case of central
forces, the equations for a system of two particles in a reference
system “at rest” are:

M1

M2

d2~r1
dt2 = F (
d2~r2

~r2 −
~r1|
|
~r1
~r2 −
~r1|
)
~r1|
~r2 −
|

.

Here M1 and M2 are the respective masses of the ﬁrst and second
particles, ~r1 is the vector radius of the ﬁrst particle, ~r2 is the vector
radius of the second particle. The function F reﬂects the character
of the forces acting between bodies.

In Newtonian mechanics, mostly forces of two types are con-

sidered: of gravity and of elasticity.

2. Classical Newtonian mechanics

Newton’s equations are written in vector form, and, consequ-
ently, they are independent of the choice of three-dimensional ref-
erence system. From equations (2.2) it is seen that the momentum
of a closed system is conserved.

As it was earlier noted, Newton considered equations (2.2) to
hold valid only in reference system at rest. But, if one takes a
reference system moving with respect to the one at rest with a
constant velocity ~v

~r ′ = ~r

~v t,

−

(2.5)

it turns out that equations (2.2) are not altered, i. e. they remain
form-invariant, and this means that no mechanical phenom-
ena could permit to ascertain whether we are in a state of rest
or of uniform and rectilinear motion. This is the essence of the
relativity principle ﬁrst discovered by Galileo. The transfor-
mations (2.5) have been termed Galilean.

Since the velocity ~v in (2.5) is arbitrary, there exists an inﬁnite
number of reference systems, in which the equations retain their
form. This means, that in each reference system the law of inertia
holds valid. If in any one of these reference systems a body is in a
state of rest or in a state of uniform and rectilinear motion, then in
any other reference system, related to the ﬁrst by transformation
(2.5), it will also be either in a state of uniform rectilinear motion
or in a state of rest.

All such reference systems have been termed inertial. The
principle of relativity consists in conservation of the form of
the equations of mechanics in any inertial reference system.
We are to emphasize that in the base of deﬁnition of an inertial
reference system lies the law of inertia by Galileo. According
to it in the absence of forces a body motion is described by linear
functions of time.

But how has an inertial reference system to be deﬁned? Newto-
nian mechanics gave no answer to this question. Nevertheless, the

2. Classical Newtonian mechanics

11

reference system chosen as such an inertial system had its origin
at the center of the Sun, while the three axes were directed toward
distant stars.

In classical Newtonian mechanics time is independent of the
choice of reference system, in other words, three-dimensional space
and time are separated, they do not form a unique four-dimensional
continuum.

Isaac Newton’s ideas concerning absolute space and absolute
motion were criticized in the 19-th century by Ernst Mach. Mach
wrote:

“No one can say anything about absolute space
and absolute motion, this is only something that can
be imagined and is not observable in experiments”.

And further:

b o d i e s

“Instead of referring a moving body to space (to
some reference system), we shall directly consider its
of the world, only in this
relation to
way it is possible to d e f i n e
a reference system
. . . even in the most simple case, when we apparently
consider the interaction between only t w o masses, it
is i mp o ss i b l e to become distracted from the rest
of the world. . . . If a body rotates with respect to the
sky of motionless stars, then there arise centrifugal
forces, while if it rotates around a n o t h e r
body,
instead of the sky of motionless stars, no centrifugal
forces will arise. I have nothing against calling the
ﬁrst revolution a b s ol u t e,
if only one does not for-
get that this signiﬁes nothing but revolution r e l a t i v e
to the sky of motionless stars”.

Therefore Mach wrote:

12

2. Classical Newtonian mechanics

“. . . there is no necessity for relating the Law of iner-
tia to some special absolute space”.

All this is correct, since Newton did not deﬁne the relation
of an inertial reference system to the distribution of matter, and,
actually, it was quite impossible, given the level of physics devel-
opment at the time. By the way, Mach also did not meet with
success. But his criticism was useful, it drew the attention of sci-
entists to the analysis of the main concepts of physics.

Since we shall further deal with ﬁeld concepts, it will be useful
to consider the methods of analytical mechanics developed during
the 18-th and 19-th centuries. Their main goal, set at the time,
consisted in ﬁnding the most general formulation for classical me-
chanics. Such research turned out to be extremely important, since
it gave rise to methods that were later quite readily generalized to
systems with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. Precisely
in this way was a serious theoretical start created, that was suc-
cessfully used of in the 19-th and 20-th centuries.

In his “Analytic Mechanics”, published in 1788, Joseph La-
grange obtained his famous equations. Below we shall present
their derivation. In an inertial reference system, Newton’s equa-
tions for a set of N material points moving in a potential ﬁeld U
have the form

mσ

σ = 1, 2, . . . , N.

(2.6)

In our case the force ~fσ is

~fσ =

∂U
∂~rσ

.

−

(2.7)

To determine the state of a mechanical system at any moment of
time it is necessary to give the coordinates and velocities of all
the material points at a certain moment of time. Thus, the state

2. Classical Newtonian mechanics

of a mechanical system is fully determined by the coordinates and
velocities of the material points. In a Cartesian reference system
Eqs. (2.6) assume the form

If one passes to another inertial reference system and makes
use of coordinates other than Cartesian, then it is readily seen that
the equations written in the new coordinates differ essentially in
form from equations (2.8). Lagrange found for Newton’s mechan-
ics such a covariant formulation for the equations of motion that
they retain their form, when transition is made to new variables.

Let us introduce, instead of coordinates ~rσ, new generalized
coordinates qλ, λ = 1, 2, . . . , n, here n = 3N. Let us assume
relations

~rσ = ~rσ(q1, . . . , qn, t).

The state of a mechanical system is fully determined by the
generalized coordinates and velocities. The form of Lagrangian
equations (2.22) is independent of the choice of generalized co-
ordinates. Although these equations are totally equivalent to the
set of equations (2.6), this form of the equations of classical me-
chanics, however, turns out to be extremely fruitful, since it opens
up the possibility of its generalization to phenomena which lie far
beyond the limits of classical mechanics.

The most general formulation of the law of motion of a me-
chanical system is given by the principle of least action (or the
principle of stationary action). The action is composed as follows

S =

L(q, ˙q)dt.

(2.23)

The integral (functional) (2.23) depends on the behaviour of func-
tions q and ˙q within the given limits. Thus, these functions are
functional arguments of the integral (2.23). The least action prin-
ciple is written in the form

δS = δ

L(q, ˙q)dt = 0.

Such equations were obtained by Leonard Euler in the course of
development of variational calculus. For our choice of function L,

2. Classical Newtonian mechanics

17

these equations in accordance with (2.21) coincide with the La-
grangian equations.

From the above consideration it is evident that mechanical mo-
tion satisfying the Lagrangian equations provides for extremum of
the integral (2.23), and, consequently, the action has a stationary
value.

The application of the Lagrangian function for describing a
mechanical system with a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom
turned out to be fruitful, also, in describing a physical ﬁeld po-
ssessing an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. In the case of
a ﬁeld, the function ψ describing it depends not only on time, but
also on the space coordinates. This means that, instead of the vari-
ables qσ, ˙qσ of a mechanical system, it is necessary to introduce
the variables ψ(xν),
. Thus, the ﬁeld is considered as a me-
chanical system with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom.
We shall see further (Sections 10 and 15) how the principle of
stationary action is applied in electrodynamics and classical ﬁeld
theory.

The formulation of classical mechanics within the framework
of Hamiltonian approach has become very important. Consider a
certain quantity determined as follows

H = pσ ˙qσ −
and termed the Hamiltonian. In (2.30) summation is performed

as follows:

These relations were obtained by transition from independent vari-

use of the Lagrangian equations. But they can be found also di-
rectly with the aid of the least action principle (2.24), if, as L, we

In the course of development of the quantum mechanics, by
analogy with the classical Poisson brackets (2.43), there originated
quantum Poisson brackets, which also satisfy all the conditions
(2.45), (2.46). The application of relations (2.48) for quantum
Poisson brackets has permitted to establish the commutation re-
lations between a coordinate and momentum.

The discovery of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian methods in
classical mechanics permitted, at its time, to generalize and extend
them to other physical phenomena. The search for various repre-
sentations of the physical theory is always extremely important,
since on their basis the possibility may arise of their generalization
for describing new physical phenomena. Within the depths of the
theory created there may be found formal sprouts of the future
theory. The experience of classical and quantum mechanics bears
witness to this assertion.

3. Electrodynamics. Space-time geometry

Following the discoveries made by Faraday in electromagnetism,
Maxwell combined magnetic, electric and optical phenomena and,
thus, completed the construction of electrodynamics by writing
out his famous equations.

H. Poincar´e in the book “The importance of science“ wrote

the following about Maxwell’s studies:

“At the time, when Maxwell initiated his studies,
the laws of electrodynamics adopted before him ex-
plained all known phenomena. He started his work
not because some new experiment limited the impor-
tance of these laws. But, considering them from a
new standpoint, Maxwell noticed that the equations
became more symmetric, when a certain term was in-
troduced into them, although, on the other hand, this
term was too small to give rise to phenomena, that
could be estimated by the previous methods.

A priori ideas of Maxwell are known to have waited
for their experimental conﬁrmation for twenty years;
if you prefer another expression, – Maxwell antici-
pated the experiment by twenty years. How did he
achieve such triumph?

This happened because Maxwell was always full of

a sense of mathematical symmetry . . . “

According to Maxwell there exist no currents, except closed
currents. He achieved this by introducing a small term – a dis-
placement current, which resulted in the law of electric charge
conservation following from the new equations.

In formulating the equations of electrodynamics, Maxwell ap-
plied the Euclidean geometry of three-dimensional space and ab-
solute time, which is identical for all points of this space. Guided

3. Electrodynamics . . .

23

by a profound sense of symmetry, he supplemented the equations
of electrodynamics in such a way that, in the same time explaining
available experimental facts, they were the equations of electro-
magnetic waves. He, naturally, did not suspect that the informa-
tion on the geometry of space-time was concealed in the equa-
tions. But his supplement of the equations of electrodynamics
turned out to be so indispensable and precise, that it clearly led
H. Poincar´e, who relied on the work of H. Lorentz, to the discov-
ery of the pseudo-Euclidean geometry of space-time. Below, we
shall brieﬂy describe, how this came about.

In the same time we will show that the striking desire of some
authors to prove that H. Poincar´e “has not made the decisive step”
to create the theory of relativity is base upon both misunderstand-
ing of the essence of the theory of relativity and the shallow knowl-
edge of Poincar´e works. We will show this below in our comments
to such statements. Just for this reason in this book I present re-
sults, ﬁrst discovered and elucidated by the light of consciousness
by H. Poincar´e minutely enough. Here the need to compare the
content of A. Einstein’s work of 1905 both with results of publi-
cations [2, 3] by H. Poincar´e, and with his earlier works naturally
arises. After such a comparison it becomes clear what new each
of them has produced.

How it could be happened that the outstanding research of
Twentieth Century – works [2,3] by H. Poincar´e were used in
many ways but in the same time were industriously consigned
to oblivion? It is high time at least now, a hundred years later, to
return everyone his property. It is also our duty.

Studies of the properties of the equations of electrodynamics
revealed them not to retain their form under the Galilean trans-
formations (2.5), i. e. not to be form-invariant with respect to
Galilean transformations. Hence the conclusion follows that the
Galilean relativity principle is violated, and, consequently, the ex-

24

3. Electrodynamics . . .

perimental possibility arises to distinguish between one inertial
reference system and another with the aid of electromagnetic or
optical phenomena. However, various experiments performed, es-
pecially Michelson’s experiments, showed that it is impossible to
ﬁnd out even by electromagnetic (optical) experiments, with a pre-
cision up to (v/c)2, whether one is in a state of rest or uniform and
rectilinear motion. H. Lorentz found an explanation for the results
of these experiments, as H. Poincar´e noted, “only by piling up
hypotheses”.

In his book “Science and hypothesis“, published in Russia

in 1904, H. Poincar´e noted:

“I shall now permit myself a digression to explain,
why, contrary to Lorentz, I do not think that more
precise observations will sometime be able to reveal
anything other, than relative displacements of mate-
rial bodies. Experiments have been performed, that
should have revealed terms of the ﬁrst order. The
result was negative; could this had been a game of
chance? Nobody could admit this; a general expla-
nation would was sought, and Lorentz found it: he
showed that the ﬁrst-order terms mutually cancelled
out. This did not occur in the case of the second-
order terms. Then, experiments of higher precision
were performed, which again yielded a negative re-
sult. Once more, this could not have been a game of
chance, – an explanation had to be found, and it ac-
tually was. There is never any lack of explanations:
hypotheses represent a fund, that is inexhaustible.

This is not all: who will not notice that chance still
plays an important part, here? Was it not a strange
chance coincidence, that gave rise to the known cir-
cumstance just at the right time to cancel out the ﬁrst-

3. Electrodynamics . . .

25

order terms, while another, totally different, was res-
ponsible for cancelling out the second-order terms?
No, it is necessary to ﬁnd one and the same expla-
nation for both cases, and then the idea will natu-
rally arise, that the same thing must equally occur in
the case of higher-order terms and that their mutual
cancellation will possess the nature of absolute preci-
sion”.

In 1904, on the basis of experimental facts, Henri Poincar´e
generalized the Galilean relativity principle to all natural pheno-
mena. He wrote [1]:

“The relativity principle, according to which the
laws of physical phenomena must be identical for an
observer at rest and for an observer undergoing uni-
form rectilinear motion, so we have no way and can-
not have any way for determining whether we are un-
dergoing such motion or not”.

Just this principle has become the key one for the subsequent
development of both electrodynamics and the theory of relativity.
It can be formulated as follows. The principle of relativity is the
preservation of form by all physical equations in any inertial
reference system.

But if this formulation uses the notion of the inertial reference
system then it means that the physical law of inertia by Galilei is al-
ready incorporated into this formulation of the relativity principle.
This is just the difference between this formulation and formula-
tions given by Poincar´e and Einstein.

Declaring this principle Poincar´e precisely knew that one of its
consequences was the impossibility of absolute motion, because
all inertial reference systems were equitable. It follows from
here that the principle of relativity by Poincar´e does not require

26

3. Electrodynamics . . .

a denial of ether in general, it only deprives ether of relation to
any system of reference. In other words, it removes the ether in
Lorentz sense. Poincar´e does not exclude the concept of ether be-
cause it is difﬁcult to imagine more absurd thing than empty space.
Therefore the word ether, which can be found in the Poincar´e ar-
ticles even after his formulation of the relativity principle, has an-
other meaning, different of the Lorentz ether. Just this ether has
to satisfy the relativity principle. Also Einstein has come to the
idea of ether in 1920.

In our time such a role is played by physical vacuum. Just this
point is up to now not understood by some physicists (we keep si-
lence about philosophers and historians of science). So they are er-
roneously attribute to Poincar´e the interpretation of relativity prin-
ciple as impossibility to register the translational uniform motion
relative to ether. Though as the reader can see there are no word
“ether” in the formulation of the relativity principle.

One must distinguish between the Galilean relativity prin-
ciple and Galilean transformations. While Poincar´e extended
the Galilean relativity principle to all physical phenomena with-
out altering its physical essence, the Galilean transformations
turned out to hold valid only when the velocities of bodies are
small as compared to the velocity of light.

Applying this relativity principle to electrodynamical pheno-

mena in ref.[3], H. Poincar´e wrote:

“This impossibility of revealing experimentally the
Earth’s motion seems to represent a general law of
Nature; we naturally come to accept this law, which
we shall term the relativity postulate, and to accept
it without reservations. It is irrelevant, whether this
postulate, that till now is consistent with experiments,
will or will not later be conﬁrmed by more precise
measurements, at present, at any rate, it is interest-

3. Electrodynamics . . .

27

ing to see, what consequences can be deduced from
it”.

In 1904, after the critical remarks made by Poincar´e, H. Lo-
rentz made a most important step by attempting again to write
electrodynamics equations in a moving reference system and show-
ing that the wave equation of electrodynamics remained unal-
tered (form-invariant) under the following transformations of the
coordinates and time:

X ′ = γ(X

vT ), T ′ = γ

time τ = T ′/γ introduced earlier in 1895

γ =

(3.2)

where c is the electrodynamic constant.

H. Poincar´e termed these transformations the Lorentz transfor-
mations. The Lorentz transformations, as it is evident from (3.1),
are related to two inertial reference systems. H. Lorentz did not
establish the relativity principle for electromagnetic phenomena,
since he did not succeed in demonstrating the form-invariance of
all the Maxwell-Lorentz equations under these transformations.

From formulae (3.1) it follows that the wave equation being
independent of translational uniform motion of the reference sys-
tem is achieved only by changing the time. Hence, the conclusion
arises, naturally, that for each inertial reference system it is neces-
sary to introduce its own physical time.
In 1907, A. Einstein wrote on this:

28

3. Electrodynamics . . .

“However, it unexpectedly turned out to be only ne-
cessary to formulate the concept of time with sufﬁcient
precision to overcome the difﬁculty, just mentioned.
One had only to understand that the subsidiary quan-
tity introduced by H.A. Lorentz, which he called “lo-
cal time”, must actually be deﬁned as “time”. With
such a deﬁnition of time the principal equations of
Lorentz’s theory will satisfy the relativity principle . . . ”

Or, speaking more precisely, instead of the true time there arose
the modiﬁed local time by Lorentz different for each inertial ref-
erence system.

But H. Lorentz did not notice this, and in 1914 he wrote on that
in detailed article “The two papers by Henri Poincar´e on mathe-
matical physics”:

“These considerations published by myself in 1904,
have stimulated Poincar´e to write his article on the
dynamics of electron where he has given my name to
the just mentioned transformation. I have to note as
regards this that a similar transformation have been
already given in an article by Voigt published in 1887
and I have not taken all possible beneﬁt from it. In-
deed I have not given the most appropriate transfor-
mation for some physical quantities encountered in
the formulae. This was done by Poincar´e and later by
Einstein and Minkowski.
. . . I had not thought of the
straight path leading to them, since I considered there
was an essential difference between the reference sys-
tems x, y, z, t and x′, y′, z′, t′.
In one of them were
used – such was my reasoning – coordinate axes with
a deﬁnite position in ether and what could be termed
true time; in the other, on the contrary, one simply
dealt with subsidiary quantities introduced with the

3. Electrodynamics . . .

29

aid of a mathematical trick. Thus, for instance, the
variable t′ could not be called time in the same sense
as the variable t. Given such reasoning, I did not
think of describing phenomena in the reference system
x′, y′, z′, t′ in precisely the same way, as in the refer-
ence system x, y, z, t . . . I later saw from the article by
Poincar´e that, if I had acted in a more systematic man-
ner, I could have achieved an even more signiﬁcant
simpliﬁcation. Having not noticed this, I was not able
to achieve total invariance of the equations; my for-
mulae remained cluttered up with excess terms, that
should have vanished. These terms were too small
to inﬂuence phenomena noticeably, and by this fact I
could explain their independence of the Earth’s mo-
tion, revealed by observations, but I did not estab-
lish the relativity principle as a rigorous and univer-
sal truth. On the contrary, Poincar´e achieved total
invariance of the equations of electrodynamics and
formulated the relativity postulate – a term ﬁrst in-
troduced by him . . . I may add that, while thus cor-
recting the defects of my work, he never reproached
me for them.
I am unable to present here all the
beautiful results obtained by Poincar´e. Nevertheless
let me stress some of them. First, he did not restrict
himself by demonstration that the relativistic trans-
formations left the form of electromagnetic equations
unchangeable. He explained this success of transfor-
mations by the opportunity to present these equations
as a consequence of the least action principle and by
the fact that the fundamental equation expressing this
principle and the operations used in derivation of the
ﬁeld equations are identical in systems x, y, z, t and

30

3. Electrodynamics . . .

x′, y′, z′, t′. . . There are some new notions in this part
of the article, I should especially mark them. Poincar´e
notes, for example, that in consideration of quanti-
ties x, y, z, t√
1 as coordinates of a point in four-
dimensional space the relativistic transformations re-
duces to rotations in this space. He also comes to idea
to add to the three components X, Y, Z of the force a
quantity

−

T = Xξ + Y η + Zζ,

which is nothing more than the work of the force at
a unit of time, and which may be treated as a fourth
component of the force in some sense. When dealing
with the force acting at a unit of volume of a body the
relativistic transformations change quantities X, Y, Z,
T √
1 in a similar way to quantities x, y, z, t√
1.
I remind on these ideas by Poincar´e because they are
closed to methods later used by Minkowski and other
scientists to easing mathematical actions in the theory
of relativity.”

−

−

As one can see, in the course of studying the article by Poincar´e,
H. Lorentz sees and accepts the possibility of describing pheno-
mena in the reference system x′, y′, z′, t′ in exactly the same
way as in the reference system x, y, z, t, and that all this fully
complies with the relativity principle, formulated by Poincar´e.
Hence it follows that physical phenomena are identical, if they
take place in identical conditions in inertial reference systems (x, y,
z, t) and (x′, y′, z′, t′), moving with respect to each other with a ve-
locity v. All this was a direct consequence of the physical equa-
tions not altering under the Lorentz transformations, that together
with space rotations form a group. Precisely all this is contained,
also, in articles by Poincar´e [2, 3].

3. Electrodynamics . . .

31

H. Lorentz writes in 1915 in a new edition of his book “Theory

of electrons” in comment 72∗:

“The main reason of my failure was I always thought
that only quantity t could be treated as a true time and
that my local time t′ was considered only as an aux-
iliary mathematical value. In the Einstein theory, just
opposite, t′ is playing the same role as t. If we want
to describe phenomena as dependent on x′, y′, z′, t′,
then we should operate with these variables in just
the same way as with x, y, z, t ”.

Compare this quotation with the detailed analysis of the Poincar´e
article given by Lorentz in 1914.

Further he demonstrates in this comment the derivation of ve-
locity composition formulae, just in the same form as it is done
in article [3] by Poincar´e. In comment 75∗ he discusses the trans-
formation of forces, exploits invariant (3.22) in the same way as
it is done by Poincar´e. The Poincar´e work is cited only in con-
nection with a particular point. It is surprising but Lorentz in his
dealing with the theory of relativity even does not cite Poincar´e
articles [2; 3]. What may happen with Lorentz in the period af-
ter 1914? How we can explain this? To say the truth, we are to
mention that because of the war the Lorentz article written in 1914
has appeared in print only in 1921. But it was printed in the same
form as Lorentz wrote it in 1914. In fact he seems to conﬁrm by
this that his opinion has not been changed. But all this in the long
run does not mean nothing substantial, because now we can
ourselves examine deeper and in more detail who has done the
work, what has been done and what is the level of this work,
being informed on the modern state of the theory and compar-
ing article of 1905 by Einstein to articles by Poincar´e.

The scale of works can be better estimated from the time
distance. Recollections of contemporaries are valuable for us as

32

3. Electrodynamics . . .

a testimony on how new ideas have been admitted by the physi-
cal community of that time. But moreover one may obtain some
knowledge on the ethic of science for some scientists, on group
interests, and maybe even something more, which is absolutely
unknown to us.

It is necessary to mention that Lorentz in his article of 1904 in
calculating his transformations has made an error and as a result
Maxwell-Lorentz equations in a moving reference frame have be-
come different than electrodynamics equations in the rest frame.
These equations were overloaded by superﬂuous terms. But Lo-
rentz has not been troubled by this. He would easily see the error if
he were not keep away of the relativity principle. After all, just
the relativity principle requires that equations have to be the same
in both two reference frames. But he singled out one reference
frame directly connected with the ether.

Now, following the early works of H. Poincar´e we shall deal
with the deﬁnition of simultaneity, on the synchronization of clocks
occupying different points of space, and we shall clarify the phys-
ical sense of local time, introduced by Lorentz.
In the article
“Measurement of time”, published in 1898 (see Collection “The
relativity principle”, compiled by Prof. A.A. Tyapkin), Poincar´e
discusses the issue of time measurement in detail. This article
was especially noted in the book “Science and hypothesis” by
Poincar´e, and, therefore, it is quite comprehensible to an inquisi-
tive reader.

In this article, for instance the following was said:

“But now let us pass to examples, that are less ar-
tiﬁcial; to report on the deﬁnition tacitly admitted by
scientists, let us consider their work and ﬁnd, on the
basis of what rules they determine simultaneity . . .

When an astronomer tells me that a certain celes-
tial phenomenon is seen in his telescope at this mo-

3. Electrodynamics . . .

33

ment, but, however, has taken place ﬁfty years ago, I
attempt to understand, what he wants to say, and, ﬁrst
of all, I ask him how he knows that, i. e. how he has
measured the velocity of light.

He started by saying that he assumed the velocity
of light to be constant and, in particular, the same in
all directions. This is precisely the postulate, with-
out which no measurement of this velocity could have
been performed. It will never be possible to test this
postulate directly in any experiment; the latter could
disprove the postulate, if the results of various mea-
surements were inconsistent with each other. We should
consider ourselves lucky that no such contradiction
exists and that the small discrepancies, which may
arise, are readily explained.

In any case this postulate, that is consistent with
the law of sufﬁcient foundation, has been accepted by
everyone; to me it is important in that it provides a
new rule for revealing simultaneity (singled out by
me. – A.L.) totally different from the one we presented
above”.

It follows from this postulate that the value of light veloc-
ity does not depend on velocity of the source of this light. This
statement is also a straightforward consequence of Maxwell elec-
trodynamics. The above postulate together with the relativity
principle formulated by H. Poincar´e in 1904 for all physical phe-
nomena precisely become the initial statements in Einstein work
of 1905.

Lorentz dealt with the Maxwell-Lorentz equations in a “moti-
onless” reference system related to the ether. He considered the
coordinates X, Y, Z to be absolute, and the time T to be the true
time.

34

3. Electrodynamics . . .

In a reference system moving along the X axis with a velocity
v relative to a reference system “at rest”, the coordinates with re-
spect to the axes moving together with the reference system have
the values

x = X

vT,

y = Y,

z = Z,

(3.3)

−

while the time in the moving reference system was termed by Lo-
rentz local time (1895) and deﬁned as follows:

τ = T

v
c2 X.

−

(3.4)

He introduced this time so as to be able, in agreement with experi-
mental data, to exclude from the theory the inﬂuence of the Earth’s
motion on optical phenomena in the ﬁrst order over v/c.

This time, as he noted, “was introduced with the aid of a
mathematical trick”. The physical meaning of local time was
uncovered by H. Poincar´e.

In the article “The theory of Lorentz and the principle of
equal action and reaction“, published in 1900, he wrote about
the local time τ , deﬁned as follows (Translation from French
into Russian by V.A. Petrov, translated from Russian into English
by J. Pontecorvo):

“I assume observers, situated at different points, to
compare their clocks with the aid of light signals; they
correct these signals for the transmission time, but,
without knowing the relative motion they are under-
going and, consequently, considering the signals to
propagate with the same velocity in both directions,
they limit themselves to performing observations by
sending signals from A to B and, then, from B to A.
The local time τ is the time read from the clocks thus
controlled. Then, if c is the velocity of light, and v is

3. Electrodynamics . . .

the velocity of the Earth’s motion, which I assume to
be parallel to the positive X axis, we will have:

τ = T

which would signify that the velocity of light equals c in all direc-
tions in a moving reference system, too. Let us mention also that
the light cone equation remains the same after multiplying r.h.s. of
Eqs. (3.1) (Lorentz transformations ) by arbitrary function φ(x).
The light cone equation preserves its form under conformal trans-
formations.

Following Poincar´e, we shall perform synchronization of the
clocks in a moving reference system with the aid of Lorentz’s local
time. Consider a light signal leaving point A with coordinates

Thus the deﬁnition of simultaneity has been introduced, which was
later applied by A. Einstein for deriving the Lorentz transforma-
tions. We have veriﬁed that the Lorentz “local time” (3.6) satisﬁes
condition (3.12). Making use of (3.12) as the initial equation for
deﬁning time in a moving reference system, Einstein arrived at the
same Lorentz “local time” (3.6) multiplied by an arbitrary func-
tion depending only on the velocity v. From (3.10), (3.11) we see
that in a reference system moving along the X axis with the local
time τ the light signal has velocity c along any direction parallel
to the X axis. The transformations, inverse to (3.3) and (3.4), will
be as follows

3. Electrodynamics . . .

We can see from the above that to have the velocity of light equal
to c in any direction in the moving reference system, also, it is
necessary to multiply the right-hand sides of transformations (3.3)
and (3.4) for x and τ by γ and to divide the right-hand sides in
transformations (3.13) for T and X by γ. Thus, this requirement
leads to appearance of the Lorentz transformations here.

H. Lorentz in 1899 used transformation of the following form

If H. Lorentz would proposed the relativity principle for all phys-

wave should have the same form in unprimed and primed systems

But H. Lorentz has not seen this in 1899. He obtained these trans-
formations in 1904 only, then he also came closely to the theory of
relativity, but did not make the decisive step. Lorentz transforma-
tions (3.1) were obtained in 1900 by Larmor. But he also did not
propose the principle of relativity for all physical phenomena and
did not require form-invariance of Maxwell equations under these
transformations. Therefore Larmor also has not made a decisive
step to construct the theory of relativity.

Precisely the constancy of the velocity of light in any iner-
tial reference system is what A. Einstein chose to underlie his ap-
proach to the electrodynamics of moving bodies. But it is provided
for not by transformations (3.3) and (3.4), but by the Lorentz trans-
formations.

A. Einstein started from the relativity principle and from the
principle of constancy of the light velocity. Both principles were
formulated as follows:

“1. The laws according to which states of physical
systems evolve do not depend on the fact whether they
are related to one or another coordinate system mov-
ing uniformly and straightforwardly respectively to each
other.”

40

3. Electrodynamics . . .

“2. Every light beam moves in a coordinate system
being at “rest” with a deﬁnite velocity V, irrespective
to the fact that this light beam is emitted by a moving
body or a body at rest.”

Let us note that Galilean principle of relativity is not included
into these principles.

It is necessary to specially emphasize that the principle of con-
stancy of velocity of light, suggested by A. Einstein as the second
independent postulate, is really a special consequence of require-
ments of the relativity principle by H. Poincar´e. This principle was
extended by him on all physical phenomena. To be convinced in
this it is sufﬁcient to consider requirements of the relativity princi-
ple for an elementary process – propagation of the electromagnetic
spherical wave. We will discuss this later.

In 1904, in the article “The present and future of mathema-
tical physics”, H. Poincar´e formulates the relativity principle for
all natural phenomena, and in the same article he again returns to
Lorentz’s idea of local time. He writes:

“. . . Imagine two observers, who wish to compare their
clocks with the aid of light signals; they exchange
signals, but, knowing that light does not propagate
instantaneously, they exchange them, so to say, by a
crossﬁre method. When the observer at point B re-
ceives the signal from point A, his clock should not
show the time shown by the clock at point A when
the signal was sent, but that time increased by a cer-
tain constant, representing the duration of the trans-
mission. Consider, for instance, a signal being sent
from point A, when the clock there shows time 0, while
the signal is received at point B, when the clock there
shows the time t. The clocks have been tested, if the
delay equal to t represents the duration of the signal

3. Electrodynamics . . .

41

transmission; to test this, a signal is sent from point B,
when the clock there shows a time 0; the signal should
be received at point A, when the clock there shows a
time t. Then the clocks will be synchronized. And, in-
deed, they show the same time at the same physical in-
stant, but under the condition that both points were at
rest. Contrariwise, the durations of transmission will
not be the same in both directions: in the case, when,
for example, point A moves toward the optical per-
turbation leaving B, and when point B moves away
from the perturbation leaving A. Clocks compared in
this way will not show the true time (the time in the
reference system “at rest“ – A.L.), they will show the
so-called local time: one clock will be slower, than the
others. But this is irrelevant, since we have no means
to notice this. All phenomena, proceeding, for in-
stance, at A, will be retarding, but identically, and the
observer will not notice it, since his clock is slower;
thus, as it follows from the relativity principle, he will
have no means to know whether he is in a state of rest
or of absolute motion.

This is, regretfully, insufﬁcient, additional hypothe-
ses are required; it is necessary to admit that moving
bodies undergo uniform contraction in the direction
of motion . . . ”

Such was the situation before the work of Lorentz, which also
appeared in 1904. Here Lorentz presents again the transformations
connecting a reference system “at rest” with a reference system
moving with a velocity v relative to the one “at rest”, which were
In this work,
termed by Poincar´e the Lorentz transformations.
Lorentz, instead of the local time (3.4) introduced the time T ′,

42

equal to

3. Electrodynamics . . .

T ′ = γτ.

(3.15)

Lorentz called time T ′ as the modiﬁed local time. Precisely this
time will be present in any inertial reference system in Galilean
coordinates. It does not violate the condition of synchronization
(3.12)

Below we shall see following Lorentz that the wave equation
does indeed not alter its form under the Lorentz transformations
(3.1). Let us check this. The wave equation of electrodynamics
has the form:

✷φ =

c2 ·

∂ t2 −

∂ 2
∂ x2 −

∂ 2
∂ y2 −

φ = 0.

(3.16)

Here φ is a scalar function in four-dimensional space, which changes
under coordinate-time transformations according to the rule φ′(x′) =
φ(x), c is the electrodynamic constant, that has the dimension of
velocity.

Let us establish the form-invariance of the operator ✷ with res-
pect to transformations (3.1). We represent part of the operator ✷
in the form

(3.21)

This means that the wave equation (3.16) remains form-invari-
ant with respect to the Lorentz transformations (3.1). In other
words, it is the same in both inertial reference systems. Hence, for
instance, it follows that the velocity of a light wave equals c, both
in a reference system “at rest” and in any other reference system
moving relative to the one “at rest” with a velocity v.

We have shown that the Lorentz transformations leave the ope-
rator ✷ unaltered, i. e. they conserve the form-invariance of the
wave equation. On the other hand, this computation can be con-
sidered as an exact derivation of the Lorentz transformations based
on the form-invariance of the operator ✷.

44

3. Electrodynamics . . .

In electrodynamics, the wave equation holds valid outside the
source both for the scalar and vector potentials, ϕ and ~A, res-
pectively.
In this case, ϕ is deﬁned as a scalar with respect to
three-dimensional coordinate transformations, and ~A is deﬁned as
a vector with respect to the same transformations. For the wave
equation to be form-invariant under the Lorentz transformations it
is necessary to consider the quantities ϕ and ~A as components of
the four-dimensional vector Aν = (ϕ, ~A)

✷Aν = 0,

ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.

In 1905 Henri Poincar´e ﬁrst established [2, 3] the invariance of
the Maxwell-Lorentz equations and of the equations of motion of
charged particles under the action of the Lorentz force with respect
to the Lorentz transformations (3.1) on the basis of the 1904 work
by Lorentz, in which the Lorentz transformations were discovered,
and on the relativity principle, formulated by Poincar´e in the same
year for all natural phenomena. All the above will be demonstrated
in detail in Sections 8 and 9.

H. Poincar´e discovered that these transformations, together
with spatial rotations form a group. He was the ﬁrst to intro-
duce the notion of four-dimensionality of a number of physical
quantities. The discovery of this group together with quantum
ideas created the foundation of modern theoretical physics.

Poincar´e established that the scalar and vector potential (ϕ, ~A),
the charge density and current (cρ, ρ~v), the four-velocity
γ, γ ~v/c
,
~f, ~v/c,
the work per unit time and force normalized to unit volume,
(cid:1)
(cid:0)
~f
, as well as the four-force transform like the quantities (ct, ~x).
The existence of the Lorentz group signiﬁes that in all inertial ref-
erence systems the Maxwell-Lorentz equations in Galilean coor-
dinates remain form-invariant, i. e. the relativity principle is satis-
ﬁed. Hence it directly follows that the descriptions of phenomena
are the same both in the reference system x, y, z, t and in the ref-

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

3. Electrodynamics . . .

45

erence system x′, y′, z′, t′, so, consequently, time t, like the other
variables x, y, z, is relative. Thus, time being relative is a direct
consequence of the existence of the group, which itself arises as
a consequence of the requirement to fulﬁl the relativity principle
for electromagnetic phenomena. The existence of this group led
to the discovery of the geometry of space-time.

H. Poincar´e discovered a number of invariants of the group

and among these – the fundamental invariant

J = c2T 2

X 2

Z 2 ,

−

(3.22)

which arose in exploiting the Lorentz transformation. It testiﬁes
that space and time form a unique four-dimensional contin-
uum of events with metric properties determined by the in-
variant (3.22). The four-dimensional space-time discovered by
H. Poincar´e, and deﬁned by invariant (3.22), was later called the
Minkowski space. Precisely this is the essence of special relativ-
ity theory. This is why it is related to all physical phenomena. It is
space-time determined by the invariant (3.22) that provides for the
existence of physically equal inertial reference systems in Nature.
However, as earlier in classical mechanics, it remains unclear, how
the inertial reference systems are related to the distribution of mat-
ter in the Universe. From expression (3.22) it follows that in any
inertial reference system a given quantity J in Galilean (Cartesian)
coordinates remains unaltered (form-invariant), while its projec-
tions onto the axes change. Thus, depending on the choice of
inertial reference system the projections X, Y, Z, T are relative
quantities, while the quantity J for any given X, Y, Z, T has an
absolute value. A positive interval J can be measured by a clock
whereas a negative one – by a rod. According to (3.22), in differ-
ential form we have

(dσ)2 = c2(dT )2

The quantity dσ is called an interval.

46

3. Electrodynamics . . .

The geometry of space-time, i. e. the space of events (the
Minkowski space) with the measure (3.23) has been termed
pseudo-Euclidean geometry.

As it could be seen from the structure of invariant J, written
in orthogonal (Galilean) coordinates, it is always possible to intro-
duce a unique time T for all points of the three-dimensional space.
This means that the three-dimensional space of a given inertial
reference system is orthogonal to the lines of time. Since, as we
shall see below, the invariant J in another inertial reference system
assumes the form (3.27), it hence follows that in this reference sys-
tem the unique time will already be different, it is determined by
the variable T ′. But length will change simultaneously. Thus, the
possibility to introduce simultaneity for all the points of three-di-
mensional space is a direct consequence of the pseudo-Euclidean
geometry of the four-dimensional space of events.

Drawing a conclusion to all the above, we see that H. Lorentz
found the transformations (3.1), which conserve the form of the
wave equation (3.16). On the basis of the relativity principle for all
physical phenomena formulated by him in 1904 and of the Lorentz
transformations, Henri Poincar´e established form-invariance of the
Maxwell-Lorentz equations and discovered the pseudo-Euclide-
an geometry of space-time, determined by the invariant (3.22) or
(3.23).

A short exposition of the detailed article [3] was given by
H. Poincar´e in the reports to the French academy of sciences [2]
and published even before the work by Einstein was submitted
for publication. This paper contained a precise and rigorous de-
scription of the solution to the problem of the electrodynamics of
moving bodies and, at the same time, an extension of the Lorentz
transformations to all natural forces, independently of their origin.
In this publication H. Poincar´e discovered Lorentz group with ac-
cordance to that a whole set of four-dimensional physical values

3. Electrodynamics . . .

47

transforming similar to t, x, y, z arose. The presence of Lorentz
group automatically provides the synchronization of clocks in any
inertial reference system. So the proper physical time arises in any
inertial system of reference – the modiﬁed local time by Lorentz.
In paper [2] relativistic formulae for adding velocities and the
transformation law for forces arose for the ﬁrst time. There exis-
tence of gravitational waves propagating with light velocity was
predicted.

It should be emphasized that just the discovery of Lorentz
group provided the uniformity of description of all physical effects
in all the inertial reference systems in full accordance with the rel-
ativity principle. Just all this automatically provided the relativity
of time and length.

H. Poincar´e discovered the invariant (3.22) on the basis of the
Lorentz transformations (3.1). On the other hand, applying the
invariant (3.22) it is easy to derive the actual Lorentz transforma-
tions (3.1). Let the invariant J in an inertial reference system have
the form (3.22) in Galilean coordinates. Now, we pass to another
inertial reference system

We see from expression (3.27) that the form-invariance of the
invariant J is provided for by the Lorentz transformations (3.28)
and (3.29). In deriving the Lorentz transformations from the ex-
pression for the invariant (3.22) we took advantage of the fact that
the invariant J may assume an arbitrary real value. Precisely this
circumstance has permitted us to consider quantities T and X as
independent variables, that can assume any real values.
If we,
following Einstein, knew only one value of J, equal to zero, we
could not, in principle, obtain Lorentz transformations of the ge-
neral form, since the space variables would be related to the time
variable.

In this case the following heuristic approach can be realized.
The equation of spherical electromagnetic wave having its center

where c is the electrodynamic constant, if we use Galilean coordi-

3. Electrodynamics . . .

Let us consider two inertial reference systems K and K ′ with
Galilean coordinates moving relative to each other with velocity v
along axis X. Let their origins coincide at the moment T = 0 and
let a spherical electromagnetic wave is emitted just at this moment
from their common origin. In reference system K it is given by

Now, we go to the most important stuff. Let us treat variables
T, X, Y, Z, appearing in the derived transformations as indepen-
dent. Then after inserting these expressions into r.h.s. of equation
(3.27) we can see that they leave quantity

c2T 2

unchanged due to the linear character of transformations. There-
fore we come to the fundamental invariant J, and so to pseudo-
Euclidean geometry of space-time. It follows from the above, in
particular, that velocity of light both in system K, and in system
K ′ is the same and therefore the principle of constancy of velocity
of light is a particular consequence of the relativity principle. Pre-
cisely this circumstance remained unnoticed by A. Einstein in his
1905 work, in which the Lorentz transformations were derived.

Earlier we have shown, following Poincar´e, that Lorentz’s “lo-
cal time” permits to perform synchronization of clocks in a mov-
ing reference system at different spatial points with the aid of a
light signal. Precisely expression (3.12) is the condition for the
synchronization of clocks in a moving reference system. It intro-
duces the deﬁnition of simultaneity of events at different points of
space. Poincar´e established that Lorentz’s “local time” satisﬁes
this condition.

So, the deﬁnition of simultaneity of events in different spa-
tial points by means of a light signal as well as the deﬁnition
of time in a moving reference system by means of light signal
both were considered by Poincar´e in his papers of 1898, 1900
and 1904. Therefore nobody has any ground to believe that
these ideas have been ﬁrst treated by A. Einstein in 1905.

But let us see, for example, what is written by Academician

L.I. Mandel’stam in his lectures [8]:

“So, the great achievement of Einstein consists in
discovering that the concept of simultaneity is a con-

3. Electrodynamics . . .

51

cept . . . that we have to deﬁne. People had the knowl-
edge of space, the knowledge of time, had this knowl-
edge many centuries, but nobody guessed that idea.”.

And the following was written by H. Weyl:

“We can now give up a belief in the objective re-
ality of simultaneity respective to physics. Emancipa-
tion of this dogma is a great gnoseological achieve-
ment of Einstein, whose name must stay in line with
the name of Copernicus”.

Is it possible that L.I. Mandel’stam and H. Weyl have not read ar-
ticles and books by Poincar´e?

Academician V.L. Ginzburg in his book “On physics and as-
trophysics” (Moscow: Nauka, 1985) in article “How and who
created Special Relativity Theory?”1 wrote:

“From the other side, in earlier works, in articles
and reports by Poincar´e there are a set of comments
which sound almost prophetical. I mean both the ne-
cessity to deﬁne a concept of simultaneity, and an op-
portunity to use light signals for this purpose, and on
the principle of relativity. But Poincar´e have not de-
veloped these ideas and followed Lorentz in his works
of 1905-1906”.

Let us give some comments to this citation.

To be precise it should be said that Poincar´e was the ﬁrst who
formulated the relativity principle for all physical processes.
He also deﬁned the concept of simultaneity at different spa-
tial points by means of the light signal in his papers 1898, 1900

and 1904. In Poincar´e works [2; 3]these concepts have been ade-
quately realized in the language of Lorentz group which provides
fulﬁlment both the requirement of relativity principle, and the in-
troduction of his own modiﬁed local Lorentz time in every inertial
system of reference. All that automatically provided a unique syn-
chronization of clocks by means of the light signal in every inertial
reference system. Just due to this not any further development
of these concepts were required after H.A. Lorentz work of 1904.
It was necessary only to introduce these concepts into the bo-
som of the theory. It was precisely realized in works [2; 3] by
means of the Lorentz group , discovered by H. Poincar´e. Poincar´e
does not follow Lorentz, he develops his own ideas by using Lorentz
achievements and he completes the creation of the theory of rel-
ativity in this way. Exactly in papers [2; 3] he extends Lorentz
invariance on all the forces of nature, including gravitational; he
discovers equations of the relativistic mechanics ; he discovers

which determines the geometry of space-time.

H. Poincar´e approach is transparent and contemporary though
it is realized almost one hundred years ago. How is it possible not
to understand this after reading Poincar´e works [2; 3]?

In the article (1905) “On the electrodynamics of moving
bodies” (
3) A. Einstein took the relation (3.12) as the initial
§
equation in searching for the function τ . But hence one can na-
turally obtain nothing, but Lorentz’s “local time”. We write the
equation obtained by him in the form

Where a is an unknown function depending only on the velocity
v.

Hence it is seen that this expression differs from the Lorentz
“local time” (3.6) only by a factor depending on the velocity v
and which is not determined by condition (3.12). It is strange to
see that A. Einstein knows that this is Lorentz ”local time”, but he
does not refer to the author. Such a treatment is not an exception
for him.

Further, for a beam of light leaving the source at the time mo-
ment τ = 0 in the direction of increasing ξ values, Einstein writes:

But further in the text of the article A. Einstein exploits the
general form of Lorentz transformations without any comments.
A. Einstein has not observed that the principle of relativity together
with electrodynamics obligatory requires a construction of four-
dimensional physical quantities, in accordance with the Lorentz
group. As a result this requires presence of the group invariants
testifying to the pseudo-Euclidean geometry of space-time. Just
due to this Einstein has not succeeded in ﬁnding relativistic equa-
tions of mechanics, because he has not discovered the law of trans-
formation for Lorentz force. He also has not understood that en-
ergy and momentum of a particle constitute a uniﬁed quantity and
that they transform under Lorentz transformations in the same way
as ct, x, y, z. It should be especially emphasized that Einstein, in
his work of 1905, in contrast to Poincar´e, has not extended Lorentz
transformations onto all forces of nature, for example, onto grav-
itation. He wrote later that “in the framework of special relativity
theory there is no place for a satisfactory theory of gravitation”.
But as it is shown in [5] this statement is not correct.

Owing to the Maxwell-Lorentz equations, the relativity prin-
ciple for inertial reference systems led Poincar´e [3] and, subse-
quently, Minkowski [4] to discovering the pseudo-Euclidean ge-
ometry of space-time. Precisely for this, we indebted to Poincar´e
and Minkowski. In 1908 H. Minkowski, addressing the 80-th mee-
ting of German naturalists and doctors in Cologne, noted [4]:

“The views of space and time, that I intend to de-
velop before you arose from an experimental-physical

56

3. Electrodynamics . . .

basis. This determines their force. Their tendency is
radical. From now on space itself and time itself are
to become ﬁctions and only a certain form of combi-
nation of the two is to retain independence”.

Therefore, the essence of special relativity theory consists in
the following (it is a postulate): all physical processes proceed
in four-dimensional space-time (ct, ~x), the geometry of which
is pseudo-Euclidean and is determined by the interval (3.23).

The consequences of this postulate are energy-momentum and
angular momentum conservation laws, the existence of inertial ref-
erence systems, the relativity principle for all physical phenomena,
the Lorentz transformations, the constancy of the velocity of light
in Galilean coordinates of an inertial system, the retardation of
time, the Lorentz contraction, the opportunity to use non-inertial
reference systems, the “clock paradox”, the Thomas precession,
the Sagnac effect and so on. On the base of this postulate and the
quantum ideas a set of fundamental conclusions was obtained and
the quantum ﬁeld theory was constructed.

By centennial of the theory of relativity it is high time to make
clear that constancy of the light velocity in all inertial systems of
reference is not a fundamental statement of the theory of relativity.

Thus, investigation of electromagnetic phenomena together with

Poincar´e’s relativity principle resulted in the uniﬁcation of space
and time in a unique four-dimensional continuum of events and
permitted to establish the pseudo-Euclidean geometry of this con-
tinuum. Such a four-dimensional space-time is homogeneous and
isotropic.

These properties of space-time provide validity of fundamental
conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum
in a closed physical system. The pseudo-Euclidean geometry of
space-time reﬂects the general dynamical properties of matter,
which make it universal. Investigation of various forms of mat-

3. Electrodynamics . . .

57

ter, of its laws of motion is at the same time investigation of space
and time. Although the actual structure of space-time has been re-
vealed to us as a result of studying matter (electrodynamics), we
sometimes speak of space as of an arena, in which some or other
phenomena take place. Here, we will make no mistake, if we
remember that this arena does not exist by itself, without matter.
Sometimes it is said that space-time (Minkowski space) is given
a priori, since its structure does not change under the inﬂuence of
matter. Such an invariability of Minkowski space arises owing to
its universality for all physical ﬁelds, so the impression is thus
created that it exists as if independently of matter. Probably just
due to a vagueness of the essence of special relativity theory for
him A. Einstein arrived at the conclusion that “within special rela-
tivity theory there is no place for a satisfactory theory of gravity”.
In Einstein’s general relativity theory, special relativity theory
In 1955

is certainly not satisﬁed, it is considered a limit case.
A. Einstein wrote:

“An essential achievement of general relativity the-
ory consists in that it has saved physics from the ne-
cessity of introducing an “inertial reference system”
(or “inertial reference systems”)”.

However, even now, there exists absolutely no experimental or
observational fact that could testify to the violation of special rel-
ativity theory. For this reason no renunciation, to whatever extent,
of its rigorous and precise application in studies of gravitational
phenomena, also, can be justiﬁed. Especially taking into account
that all known gravitational effects are explained precisely within
the framework of special relativity theory [5]. Renunciation of
special relativity theory leads to renunciation of the funda-
mental conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular
momentum. Thus, having adopted the hypothesis that all natural

58

3. Electrodynamics . . .

phenomena proceed in pseudo-Euclidean space-time, we automat-
ically comply with all the requirements of fundamental conserva-
tion laws and conﬁrm the existence of inertial reference systems.
The space-time continuum, determined by the interval (3.23)
can be described in arbitrary coordinates, also. In transition to ar-
bitrary coordinates, the geometry of four-dimensional space-
time does not change. However, three-dimensional space will
no longer be Euclidean in arbitrary coordinates. To simplify
our writing we shall, instead of variables T, X, Y, Z, introduce the
variables X ν, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3, X 0 = cT . We now perform transition
from the variables X ν to the arbitrary variables xν with the aid of
the transformations

X ν = f ν(xσ).

(3.30)

These transformation generally lead to a non-inertial reference
system. Calculating the differentials

dX ν =

∂f ν
∂xλ dxλ

(3.31)

(here and further summation is performed from 0 to 3 over iden-
tical indices λ) and substituting them into (3.23) we obtain an ex-
pression for the interval in the non-inertial reference system

(dσ)2 = γµλ(x)dxµdxλ.

(3.32)

Here, γµλ(x) is the metric tensor of four-dimensional space-time,
it is given as follows

(3.33)

Expression (3.32) is invariant with respect to arbitrary coordinate
transformations. Expression (3.33) represents the general form of
the pseudo-Euclidean metric.

3. Electrodynamics . . .

59

The difference between a metric of the form (3.23) from the
metric (3.32) is usually, in accordance with Einstein’s ideas, at-
tributed to the existence of the gravitational ﬁeld. But this is in-
correct. No gravitational ﬁeld is present in a metric of the form
(3.32). Ideas of accelerated reference systems in Minkowski space
have played an important heuristic role in Einstein reﬂections on
the problem of gravitation. They contributed to his arriving at
the idea of describing the gravitational ﬁeld with the aid of the
metric tensor of Riemannian space, and for this reason Einstein
tried to retain them, although they have nothing to do with the
gravitational ﬁeld. Precisely such circumstances prevented him
from revealing the essence of special relativity theory. From a
formal, mathematical, point of view Einstein highly appreciated
Minkowski’s work, but he never penetrated the profound physi-
cal essence of Minkowski’s work, even though the article dealt
with a most important discovery in physics – the discovery of the
pseudo-Euclidean structure of space and time.

Einstein considered special relativity theory only related to an
interval of the form (3.23), while ascribing (3.32) to general re-
lativity theory. Regretfully, such a point of view still prevails in
textbooks and monographs expounding relativity theory.

Consider a certain non-inertial reference system where the met-
ric tensor of space-time is given as γµλ(x).
It is, then, readily
shown that there exists an inﬁnite number of reference systems, in
which the interval (3.32) is as follows

(dσ)2 = γµλ(x′)dx′µdx′λ.

(3.34)

A partial case of such transformations is represented by the Lorentz
transformations, which relate one inertial reference system to an-
other. We see that the transformations of coordinates, which leave
the metric form-invariant, result in that physical phenomena pro-
ceeding in such reference systems at identical conditions can never

60

3. Electrodynamics . . .

permit to distinguish one reference system from another. Hence,
one can give a more general formulation of the relativity prin-
ciple, which not only concerns inertial reference systems, but
non-inertial ones [6], as well:

“Whatever physical reference system (inertial or
non-inertial) we choose, it is always possible to point
to an inﬁnite set of other reference systems, such as
all physical phenomena proceed there exactly like in
the initial reference system, so we have no, and cannot
have any, experimental means to distinguish, namely
in which reference system of this inﬁnite set we are”.

It must be noted that, though the metric tensor γµλ(x) in (3.33)
depends on coordinates, nevertheless the space remains pseudo-
Euclidean. Although this is evident, it must be pointed out, since
even in 1933 A. Einstein wrote the absolute opposite [7]:

“As it was shown by H. Minkowski, this metric in
special relativity theory was quasi-Euclidean, i. e. the
square “length” ds of a linear element represented a
certain quadratic function of the differentials of the
coordinates. If, on the other hand, other coordinates
are introduced with the aid of a nonlinear transfor-
mation, then ds2 remains a uniform function of the
differentials of coordinates, but the coefﬁcients of this
function (gµν) will no longer be constants, but cer-
tain functions of the coordinates. Mathematically, this
means, that physical (four-dimensional) space pos-
sesses the Riemannian metric”.

This is, naturally, wrong, since it is impossible to transform
pseudo-Euclidean geometry into Riemannian geometry by apply-
ing the transformations of coordinates (3.30). Such a statement by

3. Electrodynamics . . .

61

A. Einstein had profound physical roots. Einstein was convinced
that the pseudo-Euclidean metric in arbitrary coordinates, γµλ(x),
describes the gravitational ﬁeld, also. These ideas, put forward
by Einstein, restricted the framework of special relativity theory
and in such form became part of the material expounded in text-
books and monographs, which had hindered comprehension of the
essence of relativity theory.

Thus, for example, Academician L.I. Mandel’stam, in his lec-

tures on relativity theory [8], especially noted:

“What actually happens, how an accelerated mov-
ing clock shows time and why it slows down or does
the opposite cannot be answered by special relativity
theory, because it absolutely does not deal with the
issue of accelerated moving reference systems”.

The physical sources of such a limited understanding of special
relativity theory origin from A. Einstein. Let us present a number
of his statements concerning the special relativity theory. In 1913
he wrote [9]:

“In ordinary relativity theory only linear orthogo-

nal transformations are admissible”.

In the next article of the same year he writes [10]:

“In the initial relativity theory the physical equa-
tions being independent of the special choice of refer-
ence system is based on postulating the fundamental
invariant ds2 =
i , while now the goal consists

dx2

i
X

in constructing a theory, in which the role of the fun-
damental invariant is to be assumed by a linear ele-
ment of the most general form

ds2 =

gikdxidxk ”.

Xi,k

62

3. Electrodynamics . . .

Later, in 1930, A. Einstein wrote [11]:

“In special relativity theory only such variations
of coordinates (transformations) are allowed that pro-
vide for the quantity ds2 (the fundamental invariant)
to assume in the new coordinates, also, the form of
the sum of square differentials of the new coordinates.
Such transformations are called Lorentz transforma-
tion”.

Although Einstein, here, takes advantage of the invariant (in-
terval) discovered by Poincar´e, he understands it only in a limited
(strictly diagonal) sense. For A. Einstein it was difﬁcult to see that
the Lorentz transformations and the relativity of time concealed a
fundamental fact: space and time form a unique four-dimensional
continuum with pseudo-Euclidean geometry, determined by the
interval

ds2 = γµν(x)dxµdxν,

det(γµν) = γ < 0,

(3.35)

with the metric tensor γµν(x), for which the Riemannian curvature
tensor equals zero. But, precisely, the existence of the four-dimen-
sional space of events with a pseudo-Euclidean metric permitted
to establish that a number of vector quantities in Euclidean three-
dimensional space are at the same time components of four-dimen-
sional quantities together with certain scalars in Euclidean space.
This was performed by H. Poincar´e and further developed by
H. Minkowski. Very often, without understanding the essence of
theory, some people write that Minkowski allegedly gave the ge-
ometrical interpretation of relativity theory. This is not true. On
the basis of the group discovered by Poincar´e, H. Poincar´e and
H. Minkowski revealed the pseudo-Euclidean geometry of space-
time, which is precisely the essence of special relativity theory.
In 1909 H. Minkowski wrote about this in the article “Space

and time”:

3. Electrodynamics . . .

63

“Neither Einstein, nor Lorentz dealt with the con-
cept of space, maybe because in the case of the afor-
ementioned special transformation, under which the
x′, t′ plane coincides with the x, t plane, it may be un-
derstood that the x axis of space retains its position.
The attempt to thus evade the concept of space could
have indeed been regarded as a certain impudence of
the mathematical thought. But after making this step,
surely unavoidable for true comprehension of the Gc
group (the Lorentz group. – A.L.), the term “relativity
postulate” for requiring invariance with respect to the
Gc group seems to me too insipid. Since the meaning
of the postulate reduces to that in phenomena we only
have the four-dimensional world in space and time,
but that the projections of this world onto space and
time can be taken with a certain arbitrariness, I would
rather give this statement the title “postulate of the
absolute world” or, to be short, world postulate”.

It is surprising, but in H. Minkowski’s work there is no refer-
ence to the articles [2] and [3] by H. Poincar´e, although it just gives
[2] and
the details of what had already been presented in refs.
[3]. However, by the brilliant exposition before a broad audience
of naturalists it attracted general attention. In 1913, in Germany,
a collection of articles on relativity by H.A. Lorentz, A. Einstein,
H. Minkowski was published. The fundamental works [2] and [3]
by H. Poincar´e were not included in the collection. In the com-
ments by A. Sommerfeld to Minkowski’s work Poincar´e is only
mentioned in relation to particulars. Such hushing up of the fun-
damental works of H. Poincar´e in relativity theory is difﬁcult to
understand.

E. Whittaker was the ﬁrst who came to the conclusion of de-
cisive contribution of H. Poincar´e to this problem when studying

64

3. Electrodynamics . . .

the history of creation of the special relativity theory, 50 years
ago. His monograph caused a remarkably angry reaction of some
authors. But E. Whittaker was mainly right. H. Poincar´e re-
ally created the special theory of relativity grounding upon
Lorentz work of 1904 and he gave this theory the general char-
acter by extending it onto all physical phenomena. Instead of
more thorough study and comparison of Einstein 1905 work and
Poincar´e papers (it is just the only way of objective study of the
problem) the way of complete rejection of Whittaker’s conclusions
was chosen. So, the idea that the theory of relativity was created
independently and exclusively by A. Einstein was propagated in
literature without detail investigations. This was also my view up
to the middle of 80-s until I had read articles by H. Poincar´e and
A. Einstein.

4. The relativity of time and the contraction of

length

Consider the course of time in two inertial reference systems, one
of which will be considered to be at rest, while another one will
move with respect to the ﬁrst one with a velocity v. According to
the relativity principle, the change in time shown by the clocks (for
a given time scale) in both reference systems is the same. There-
fore, the both count their own physical time in the same manner.
If the clock in the moving reference system is at rest, then its in-
terval in this system of reference is

dσ2 = c2dt′2,

(4.1)

t′ is the time shown by the clock in this reference system.

Since this clock moves relative to the other reference system
with the velocity v, the same interval, but now in the reference
system at rest will be

4. The relativity of time and the contraction of length

One often reads that a retardation of moving clocks takes place.
It is wrong, because such a statement contradicts the principle of
relativity. The clock rate in all inertial reference systems does not
change. The clocks equally measure physical time of their own
inertial system of reference. This is not a change of the clock rate
but a change of a physical process duration. The duration of a local
physical process according to the clock of this inertial system or a
clock in other inertial system is in general different. It is minimal
in the system where the process is localized in one spatial point.
Precisely this meaning is implied in saying about the retardation
of time.

Integrating this relation, we obtain

Precisely owing to this effect it turns out to be possible to trans-

their lifetime in the state of rest is very small.

In the case considered above we dealt with a time-like interval
dσ2 > 0. We shall now consider another example, when the inter-
val between the events is space-like, dσ2 < 0. Again we consider

two such inertial reference systems. Consider measurement, in a
moving reference system, of the length of a rod that is at rest in
another reference system. We ﬁrst determine the method for mea-
suring the length of a moving rod. Consider an observer in the
moving reference system, who records the ends of the rod, X ′

From relations (4.7) and (4.11) we see, that events that are si-
multaneous in one inertial reference system will not be simul-
taneous in another inertial reference system, so the notion of
simultaneity is relative. Relativity of time is a straightforward
consequence of the deﬁnition of simultaneity for different spatial
points of inertial reference system by means of a light signal. The
contraction (4.13) is a consequence of the relative nature of simul-
taneity, or to be more precise, of the existence of the fundamental
invariant (3.22).

Thus, we have established that, in accordance with special re-
lativity theory, the time interval between events for a local object
and the length of a rod, given the method of measurement of (4.7),
are relative. They depend on the choice of the inertial reference
system. Only the interval between events has an absolute sense.
It must be especially noted that contraction of the length of a rod
(4.13) is determined not only by the pseudo-Euclidean structure
of space-time, but also by our method of measuring length, so
contraction, unlike the slowing down of time (4.5), does not have
such essential physical signiﬁcance. This is due to the slowing
down of time being related to a local object, and such objects ex-
ist in Nature, they are described by the time-like interval dσ2 > 0;
consequently, a causal relationship is realized, here. Contraction
of length is related to different points in space and is, therefore,
described by the space-like interval dσ2 < 0, when no causal rela-
tionship is present.

Let us return to the issue of Lorentz contraction, determined by
formula (4.13). We saw that in the case considered above, when
the rod is at rest in the unprimed inertial reference system and has a
length ℓ0, for all observers in other inertial reference systems there

4. The relativity of time and the contraction of length

occurs, given the adopted method of measuring length (4.7), con-
traction, and the length will be determined by formula (4.13). It is
quite evident that here nothing happens to the rod. Some authors
call this contraction effect kinematical, since the rod undergoes no
deformation, here. And they are right in this case, and there is no
reason for criticizing them. However, it must be noted that this
kinematics is a consequence of the pseudo-Euclidean structure of
space, which reﬂects the general dynamic properties of matter –
the conservation laws.

Back in 1905 H. Poincar´e wrote the following about this situa-

tion:

“If we were to accept the relativity principle, then
we would ﬁnd a common constant in the law of grav-
ity and in electromagnetic laws – the velocity of light.
Precisely in the same way, we would also encounter it
in all the other forces of whatever origin, which can
be only explained from two points of view: either eve-
rything existing in the world is of electromagnetic ori-
gin, or this property, that is, so to say, common to all
physical phenomena, is nothing more, than an exter-
nal appearance, something related to the methods of
our measurements. How do we perform our measure-
ments? Earlier we would have answered as follows:
by carrying bodies, considered solid and unchange-
able, one to the place of the other; but in modern
theory, taking into account the Lorentz contraction,
this is no longer correct. According to this theory,
two segments are, by deﬁnition, equal, if light covers
them in the same time”. (singled out by me. – A.L.)

A totally different situation arises in the case of motion with ac-
celeration. If, for instance, the rod, that is at rest in the unprimed
inertial reference system and has a length ℓ0, starts moving with

70

4. The relativity of time and the contraction of length

acceleration along its length so that both of its ends start moving
simultaneously, then in the reference system, related to the rod,
its length will increase according to the law

L =

or, if formula (12.3) is taken into account, then one can express the
velocity v(t) via the acceleration a and obtain the expression

of events being the same in the unprimed inertial reference system
and in the reference system moving with acceleration a, in which
the rod is at rest. This means that the rod undergoes rupture strains.
Earlier we found the Lorentz transformations for the case, when
the motion of one reference system with respect to another inertial
reference system proceeded with a constant velocity along the X
axis. Now, consider the general case, when the motion takes place
with a velocity ~v in an arbitrary direction

~r = ~R

~v T.

(4.14)

Transformation (4.14) provides the transition to inertial reference
system the origin of which moves with constant velocity ~v related
to the initial reference system.

Let us decompose vectors ~R, ~R′ in the initial Galilean refer-
ence system along the direction of velocity ~v and along the direc-
tion perpendicular to velocity ~v:

the vector along the velocity ~v changes, in accordance with the
Lorentz transformations (3.1), while the transverse component re-
mains unchanged.

Let us verify that this assertion is correct. To this end we shall
take as a starting point the invariant (3.22). Substituting (4.14) into

(4.30)

Formulae (4.24) and (4.30) coincide with formulae (4.18) and (4.19);
this testiﬁes to our assumption, made earlier in the course of their
derivation, being correct.

It should be especially emphasized that we have derived above
the general formulae relating coordinates (T, ~R) of the initial in-
ertial reference system to coordinates (T ′, ~R′) of the reference sys-
tem moving with constant velocity ~v relative to the ﬁrst system.
We have used the form-invariance of invariant (3.22) and identi-
cal transformations only. If by means of transformations (4.24)
and (4.30) we go from inertial reference system S to system S′
and later to system S′′ , then after these two subsequent transfor-
mations we will get transformation which will be different from
transformations (4.24) and (4.30) by a rotation in 3-dimensional
space. It means that transformations (4.24) and (4.30) do not form
a subgroup of the Lorentz group. The rotation mentioned above
reduces axes of reference system S to the same orientation as axes
of system S′′. Thomas effect which will be considered in Section
14 is caused just by this circumstance.

The general derivation of Lorentz transformations from the rel-
ativity principle, Galilean principle of inertia and the wavefront

6. Elements of vector and tensor analysis in

Minkowski space

All physical quantities must be deﬁned in a way, to have their
physical meaning independent on the choice of reference system.
Consider a certain reference system xν, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3 given
in four-dimensional Minkowski space. Instead of this reference
system, it is possible to choose another, deﬁned by the expression

We shall consider functions f ν as continuous and differentiable.

If at any point Jacobian of the transformation

differs from zero, then under this condition the variables x′ν will
be independent, and, consequently, the initial variables xν may
unambiguously be expressed in terms of the new ones x′ν

xα = ϕα(x′σ).

(6.3)

Physical quantities must not depend on the choice of reference
system, therefore, it should be possible to express them in terms
of geometrical objects. The simplest geometrical object is scalar
φ(x), which under transition to new variables transforms as fol-
lows:

φ′(x′) = φ

x(x′)

.

(6.4)

The gradient of scalar function φ(x) transforms by the rule for
differentiating composite functions

here, and below, summation is performed over identical indices σ
from 0 to 3.

A set of functions that transforms, under coordinate transfor-

mation, by the rule (6.5) is called a covariant vector

Accordingly, a quantity Bµν, that transforms by the rule

is called a covariant tensor of the second rank, and so on.

Let us now pass to another group of geometrical objects. Con-

sider the transformation of the differentials of coordinates:

∂x′ν

A set of functions that transforms, under coordinate transfor-

mations, by the rule (6.8) is called a contravariant vector:

Accordingly, a quantity Bµν, that transforms by the rule

∂xσ Aσ(x).

B′µν(x′) =

∂x′µ
∂xσ ·

∂x′ν
∂xλ Bσλ(x),

has been termed a contravariant tensor of the second rank, and so
on.

From the transformational properties of a vector or a tensor it
follows, that, if all its components are zero in one reference sys-
tem, then they are zero, also, in any other reference system. Note,
that coordinates xν do not form a vector, while differential dxν

is a vector. The coordinates xν only form a vector with respect to
linear transformations.

Now, we calculate the quantity A′

λ is a mixed tensor of the second rank and is known

Taking into account (6.12) in expression (6.11) we ﬁnd

A′

σ(x′)B′σ(x′) = Aλ(x)Bλ(x) .

(6.13)

Hence it is evident that this quantity is a scalar, it is usually
called an invariant.

In writing expression (3.32) we actually dealt with the funda-

mental invariant

dσ2 = γµλ(x)dxµdxλ ,

det(γµν) = γ < 0.

(6.14)

The existence of the metric tensor of Minkowski space, that has
the general form (3.33), permits to raise and to lower indices of
vector and tensor quantities, for example:

Aν = γνλ(x)Aλ , Aλ = γλσAσ , AνAν = γλσAλAσ . (6.15)

Tensors can be added and subtracted, for example,

Here it is necessary to observe both the order of multipliers and
the order of indices.

Transformations (6.9) form a group. Consider

A′ν(x′) =

∂x′ν
∂xσ Aσ(x) , A′′µ =

∂x′′µ
∂x′λ A′λ(x′) ,

(6.19)

hence we have

A′′µ(x′′) =

∂x′′µ
∂x′λ ·

∂x′′µ
∂xσ Aσ(x) .

∂x′λ
∂xσ Aσ(x) =
Note that tensor calculus does not depend on the metric properties
of space. It is persisted, for example, in Riemannian geometry,
where the group of motion of space-time is absent, in the general
case. On the other hand, the group of general coordinate transfor-
mations (6.19–6.20) is fully persisted, since it is independent of
the metric properties of space, But it has no any physical meaning.

81

Thus, we have established that transition from the reference
system xν to the reference system x′ν and, subsequently, to the
reference system x′′ν is equivalent to direct transition from the ref-
erence system xν to the reference system x′′ν. Precisely in this
case, it can be said that the Lorentz transformations form a group.
Poincar´e discovered [2] this group and named it the Lorentz
group. He found the group generators and constructed the Lie
algebra of the Lorentz group. Poincar´e was the ﬁrst to estab-
lish that, for universal invariance of the laws of Nature with
respect to the Lorentz transformations to hold valid, it is nec-
essary for the physical ﬁelds and for other dynamical and kine-
matical characteristics to form a set of quantities transform-
ing under the Lorentz transformations in accordance with the
group, or, to be more precise, in accordance with one of the
representations of the Lorentz group.

Several general words about a group. A group is a set of ele-
ments A, B, C . . . for which the operation of multiplication is de-
ﬁned. Elements may be of any nature. The product of any two
elements of a group yields an element of the same group. In the
case of a group, multiplication must have the following properties.

1. The law of associativity

(AB)C = A(BC) .

2. A group contains a unit element E

AE = A .

3. Each element of a group has its inverse element

AB = E , B = A−1 .

Transformations of the Lorentz group can be given in matrix

The second term in the right-hand part of the ﬁrst equation of (8.1)
is precisely that small term – the displacement current, intro-
duced by Maxwell in the equations of electrodynamics. Namely it
was mentioned in Section 3. Since the divergence of a curl is zero,
from the ﬁrst and third equations of (8.1) follows the conservation
law of current

(8.1) be satisﬁed identically we represent ~H in the form

~H = rot ~A .

Thus, we have introduced the vector potential ~A. Substituting ex-
pression (8.4) into the second equation from (8.1) we obtain

For the equation of charge conservation to be form-invariant
with respect to the Lorentz transformations it is necessary that the
density ρ and current be components of the contravariant vector
Sν

Sν = (cρ,~j) = (S0, ~S) ,

~j = ρ~v .

(8.9)

The contravariant vector Sν transforms under the Lorentz transfor-
mations in the same way as (ct , ~x). The equation (8.3) of charge
conservation assume the form

∂Sν
∂xν = 0 ,

(8.10)

✷ ~A =

(8.11)

For these equations not to alter their form under Lorentz trans-
formations, it is necessary that the scalar and vector potentials be
components of a contravariant vector Aν

Aν = (A0, ~A) = (φ, ~A) .

(8.12)

Since, as we showed earlier, the operator ✷ does not alter its form
under the Lorentz transformations, Eqs. (8.11) at any inertial sys-
tem of reference will have the following form

✷Aν =

Sν ,

ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.

(8.13)

4π
c

The vectors Sν and Aν were ﬁrst introduced by Henri Poin-
car´e [3].

Uniﬁcation of φ and ~A into the four-vector Aν is necessary,
since, as the right-hand part of (8.13) represents the vector Sν,
then the left-hand part must also transform like a vector. Hence, it
directly follows that, if in a certain inertial reference system only
an electric ﬁeld exists, then in any other reference system there
will be found, together with the electric ﬁeld, a magnetic ﬁeld,
also, owing to Aν transforming like a vector. This is an immediate
consequence of validity of the relativity principle for electromag-
netic phenomena.

We emphasize that the identical appearance of equations

still does not mean their form-invariance under these trans-

to ascertain that Lorentz transformations form a group and
ﬁeld variables (for example, ~E and ~H) transform according
to representation of this group.

Taking into account the relationship between the components
of the tensor F µν and the components of the electric and magnetic

These formulae were ﬁrst discovered by Lorentz, however,
neither he, nor, later, Einstein established their group nature.
This was ﬁrst done by H. Poincar´e, who discovered the trans-
formation law for the scalar and vector potentials [3]. Since φ
and ~A transform like (ct, ~x), H. Poincar´e has found, with the aid
of formulae (8.4) and (8.6), the procedure of calculation for the
quantities ~E and ~H under transition to any other inertial reference
system.

From the formulae for transforming the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds it follows that, if, for example, in a reference system K ′ the
magnetic ﬁeld is zero, then in another reference system it already
differs from zero and equals

In accordance with the second invariant (8.32), the ﬁelds ~E
and ~H, that are reciprocally orthogonal in one reference system,
persist this property in any other reference system. If in reference
system K the ﬁelds ~E and ~H are orthogonal, but not equal, it is
always possible to ﬁnd such a reference system, in which the ﬁeld
is either purely electric or purely magnetic, depending on the sign
of the ﬁrst invariant from (8.33).

Now let us consider the derivation of the Poynting equation
(1884). To do so we multiply both parts of ﬁrst equation from
Eqs. (8.1) by vector ~E, and both parts of second equation from
Eqs. (8.1) – by vector ~H; then we subtract the results and obtain

The term standing in l.h.s. determines a change of electromagnetic
energy in volume V at a unit of time. The ﬁrst term in r.h.s. char-
acterizes work done by electric ﬁeld on charges in volume V. The
second term in r.h.s. determines the energy ﬂow of electromag-
netic ﬁeld through surface Σ, bounding volume V.

ﬁrst proposed by N. A. Umov. The notion on the energy ﬂow
has become one of the most important in physics. With the help
of the Poynting equation it is possible to prove the uniqueness
theorem in the following formulation (see: I.E. Tamm Founda-
tions of the theory of electricity. Moscow: “Nauka”, 1976 (in
Russian). pp. 428-429):

“. . . electromagnetic ﬁeld at any instant of time t1 >
0 and at any point of volume V , bounded by an ar-
bitrary closed surface S is uniquely determined by
Maxwell equations, if initial values for electromag-
netic vectors ~E and ~H are prescribed in all this part
of space at time t = 0 and if also for one of these
vectors (for example, ~E) boundary values of its tan-
gential components on surface S are given during
the whole time interval from t = 0 to t = t1.

Let us suppose the opposite, i. e. suppose there are
two different systems of solutions of Maxwell equa-
tions ~E′, ~H ′ and ~E′′, ~H ′′, satisfying the same initial
and boundary conditions. Due to linear character
of the ﬁeld equations the difference of these solutions
~E′′′ = ~E′
~H ′′ should also sat-
isfy Maxwell equations under the following additional
conditions:

~E′′ and ~H ′′′ = ~H ′

−

−

a) ~Eextra = 0,
b) at time t = 0 in each point of volume V : ~E′′′ =
0, ~H ′′′ = 0 (because at t = 0 ~E′, ~E′′ and ~H ′, ~H ′′ have,
as supposed, equal given values),

92

8. Invariance of Maxwell-Lorentz equations

c) during the whole time interval from t = 0 to
t = t1 in all points of surface S tangential compo-
nents of vector ~E′′′ or vector ~H ′′′ are equal to zero (by
the same reason).

Let us apply the Poynting theorem (which is a con-
sequence of Maxwell equations) to this ﬁeld ~E′′′, ~H ′′′
and put work of extraneous forces P equal to zero.
The surface integral which enters the Poynting equa-
tion is equal to zero during the whole time interval
from t = 0 to t = t1, because from Eq. (c) it follows
that on surface S

therefore, at any time during this interval we get

should stay equal to zero. This may take place only if
~E′′′ and ~H ′′′ stay equal to zero at all points of volume
V . Therefore, the two systems of solutions of the ini-
tial problem ~E′, ~H ′ and ~E′′, ~H ′′, supposed by us to be
different, are necessarily identical. So the uniqueness
theorem is proved.

It is easy to get convinced that in case of the whole
inﬁnite space the ﬁxing of ﬁeld vectors values on bound-
ing surface S may be replaced by putting the follow-
ing conditions at inﬁnity:

ER2 and HR2 at R

stay ﬁnite.

→ ∞

Indeed, it follows from these conditions that in-
tegral of the Poynting vector over inﬁnitely distant
surface is occurred to be zero. This fact enables us
to prove applicability of the above inequality to the
whole inﬁnite space, starting from the Poynting equa-
tion. Also uniqueness of solutions for ﬁeld equations
follows from this inequality”.

For consistency with the relativity principle for all electro-
magnetic phenomena, besides the requirement that the Max-
well-Lorentz equations remain unaltered under the Lorentz
transformations, it is necessary that the equations of motion
of charged particles under the inﬂuence of the Lorentz force
remain unaltered, also.

All the aforementioned was only performed in works [2, 3]
by H. Poincar´e. The invariability of physical equations in all iner-
tial reference systems is just what signiﬁes the identity of physical
phenomena in these reference systems under identical conditions.
Precisely for this reason, all natural standards are identical in all
inertial reference systems. Hence, for instance, follows the equal-
ity of the NaCl crystal lattice constants taken to be at rest in two

94

8. Invariance of Maxwell-Lorentz equations

inertial reference systems moving with respect to each other. This
is just the essence of the relativity principle. The relativity prin-
ciple was understood exactly in this way in classical mechanics,
also. Therefore, one can only express surprise at what Academi-
cian V.L. Ginzburg writes in the same article (see this edition, the
footnote on page 51):

“I add that, having reread now (70 years after they
were published!) the works of Lorentz and Poincar´e, I
have been only able with difﬁculty and knowing the
result beforehand (which is known to extremely fa-
cilitate apprehension) to understand why invariance
of the equations of electrodynamics with respect to
the Lorentz transformations, demonstrated in those
works, could at the time be considered as evidence
for validity of the relativity principle”.

Though A. Einstein wrote in 1948

“With the aid of the Lorentz transformation the spe-
cial relativity principle can be formulated as follows:
the laws of Nature are invariant with respect to the
Lorentz transformation (i. e. a law of Nature must not
change, if it would be referred to a new inertial refer-
ence system obtained with the aid of Lorentz transfor-
mation for x, y, z, t)”.

Now, compare the above with that written by H. Poincar´e wrote

in 1905:

“. . . If it is possible to give general translational mo-
tion to a whole system without any visible changes
taking place in phenomena, this means that the equa-
not
electromagnetic
tions
change as a result of certain transformations, which

ﬁeld will

we shall call Lorentz transformations; two systems,
one at rest, and another undergoing translational mo-
tion represent, therefore, an exact image of each other”.

We see that classical works require attentive reading, not to

mention contemplation.

We shall now establish the law for transformation of the Lorentz
force under transformation from one inertial reference system to
another. The equations of motion will be established in Section 9.
The expression for the Lorentz force, referred to unit volume, will,
in reference system K, have the form (8.2)

This result coincides with the expression obtained by H. Poincar´e
(see Section 9, p. 112).

Thus, the entire set of Maxwell-Lorentz equations is written
via vectors and tensors of four-dimensional space-time. The Lo-
rentz group, that was discovered on the basis of studies of elec-
tromagnetic phenomena, was extended by H. Poincar´e [2, 3] to
all physical phenomena.

In ref. [3] developing Lorentz ideas he wrote:

“. . . All forces, of whatever origin they may be, be-
have, owing to the Lorentz transformations (and, con-
sequently, owing to translational motion) precisely like
electromagnetic forces”.

H. Poincar´e wrote:

“The principle of physical relativity may serve us
in deﬁning space. It gives us, so to say, a new instru-
ment for measurement. Let me explain. How can a
solid body serve us in measuring or, to be more cor-
rect, in constructing space? The point is the follow-
ing: by transferring a solid body from one place to
another, we thus notice that it can, ﬁrst, be applied to
one ﬁgure and, then, to another, and we agree to con-
sider these ﬁgures equal. This convention gave rise
to geometry. . . Geometry is nothing, but a doctrine on
the reciprocal relationships between these transfor-
mations or, to use mathematical language, a doctrine
on the structure of the group composed by these trans-
formations, i. e. the group of motions of solid bodies.

100

8. Invariance of Maxwell-Lorentz equations

Now, take another group, the group of transforma-
tions, that do not alter our differential equations. We
obtain a new way of determining the equality of two
ﬁgures. We no longer say: two ﬁgures are equal, when
one and the same solid body can be applied both to
one ﬁgure and to the other. We will say: two ﬁgures
are equal, when one and the same mechanical system,
sufﬁciently distant from neighbouring that it can be
considered isolated, being ﬁrst accommodated so that
its material points reproduce the ﬁrst ﬁgure, and then
so that they reproduce the second ﬁgure, behaves in
the second case like in the ﬁrst. Do these two views
differ from each other in essence? No. . .

A solid body is much the same mechanical system
as any other. The only difference between our previ-
ous and new deﬁnitions of space consists in that the
latter is broader, allowing the solid body to be re-
placed by any other mechanical system. Moreover,
our new conventional agreement not only deﬁnes space,
but time, also. It explains to us, what are two simulta-
neous moments, what are two equal intervals of time,
or what is an interval of time twice greater than an-
other interval”.

Further he notes:

“Just transformations of the “Lorentz group” do
not alter differential equations of dynamics. If we sup-
pose that our system is referred not to axes at rest, but
to axes in translational motion, then we have to admit,
that all bodies are deformed. For example, a sphere
is transformed to an ellipsoid which smallest axis co-
incides with the direction of translational motion of

8. Invariance of Maxwell-Lorentz equations

101

coordinate axes. In this case the time itself is expe-
rienced profound changes. Let us consider two ob-
servers, the ﬁrst is connected to axes at rest, the sec-
ond – to moving axes, but both consider themselves
at rest. We observe that not only the geometric ob-
ject treated as a sphere by ﬁrst observer will be looked
liked an ellipsoid for the second observer, but also two
events treated as simultaneous by the ﬁrst will not be
simultaneous for the second.”.

All the above formulated by H. Poincar´e (not mentioning the
content of his articles [2, 3]) completely contradicts to A. Einstein
words written in his letter to professor Zangger (Director of Law
Medicine Institute of Zurich University) 16.11.1911, that H. Poin-
car´e “has taken up a position of unfounded denial (of the theory of
relativity) and has revealed insufﬁcient understanding of the new
situation at all”. (B. Hoffmann “. Einstein”, Moscow: Progress,
1984, p. 84 (in Russian)).

If one reﬂects upon H. Poincar´e words, one can immediately
perceive the depth of his penetration into the essence of physical
relativity and the relationship between geometry and group. Pre-
cisely in this way, starting from the invariability of the Maxwell-
Lorentz equations under the Lorentz group transformations, which
provided for consistency with the principle of physical relativity,
H. Poincar´e discovered the geometry of space-time, determined by
the invariant (3.22).

Such space-time possesses the properties of homogeneity and
isotropy.
It reﬂects the existence in Nature of the fundamental
conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum
for a closed system. Thus, the “new convention” is not arbitrary,
it is based on the fundamental laws of Nature.

Now let us quote one striking statement by Hermann Weyl. It
is written in his book “Raum. Zeit. Materie” appeared in 1918

102

8. Invariance of Maxwell-Lorentz equations

(cited from Russian translation: Moscow: Yanus, 1996, p. 207):

“The Solution given by A. Einstein (here is refer-
ence to the 1905 paper by A. Einstein – A.L.), which
has solved all difﬁculties by one strike, is as follows.
World is a four-dimensional afﬁne space in which
a metrization is enclosed by means of an indeﬁnite
quadratic form

Q(x) = (xx)
with one negative and three positive dimensions”.

Below he writes:

x2
0 + x2
“ Q(x)=
here xi are point coordinates”.

−

1 + x2

2 + x2
3,

But all this mentioned by H. Weyl were discovered by H. Poincar´e

(see articles [2, 3]), and not by A. Einstein. But H. Weyl does not
see this and even more, he writes in his footnote:

“Two almost simultaneously appeared works by
H. Lorentz and H. Poincar´e, are closely related to it
(the article by A. Einstein of 1905 – A.L.). They are
not so clear and complete in presenting principal is-
sues as Einstein’s article is.

Then references to works by Lorentz and Poincar´e are given. Very
strange logic. H. Weyl has exactly formulated the solution, “which
has solved all difﬁculties by one strike”, but just this is contained
in articles by H. Poincar´e [2, 3], and not Einstein. It is surpris-
ing how he has not seen this during his reading of the Poincar´e
articles, because, as he mentions correctly, the essence of the the-
ory of relativity is just this. All the main consequences of it follow
trivially from this, including the deﬁnition of simultaneity concept

8. Invariance of Maxwell-Lorentz equations

for different space points by means of the light signal, introduced
by H. Poincar´e in his articles published in 1898, 1900 and 1904.

What a clearness and completeness of presentation of the prin-
cipal issues is additionally necessary for Weyl when he himself
has demonstrated what “has solved all difﬁculties by one strike.”
H. Weyl should better be more attentive in reading and more accu-
rate in citing literature.

Above we have convinced ourselves that the symmetric set
of equations of electrodynamics, (8.1), (8.2), which is invariant
with respect to coordinate three-dimensional orthogonal transfor-
mations, at the same time turned out to be invariant, also, with re-
spect to Lorentz transformations in four-dimensional space-time.
This became possible due to a number of vector quantities of Eu-
clidean space become, together with certain scalar quantities of the
same space, components of four-dimensional quantities. At the
same time, some vector quantities, such as, for example, ~E, ~H,
are derivatives of the components of four-dimensional quantities,
which is the evidence that they are components of a tensor of the
second rank in Minkowski space. The latter leads to the result
that such concepts as electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths are not
absolute.

104

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

In Section 3 we saw that the requirement of fulﬁlment of the rela-
tivity principle for electrodynamics leads to transition from one in-
ertial reference system to another, moving with respect to the ﬁrst
along the x axis with a velocity v, being realized not by Galilean
transformations (2.5), but by Lorentz transformations (3.1). Hence
it follows, of necessity, that the equations of mechanics must be
changed to make them form-invariant with respect to the Lorentz
transformations. Since space and time are four-dimensional, the
physical quantities described by vectors will have four compo-
nents. The sole four-vector describing a point-like body has the
form

Here the interval dσ in Galilean coordinates is as follows

This four-vector of velocity was ﬁrst introduced by Poincar´e
[3].

We now introduce the four-vector of momentum

where m is rest mass of a point-like body.

ten in the form

here F ν is the four-vector of force, which is still to be expressed
via the ordinary Newtonian force ~f . It is readily veriﬁed that the
four-force is orthogonal to the four-velocity, i. e.

F νUν = 0.

On the basis of (9.2) and (9.3) equation (9.5) can be written in

connection he wrote:

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

“Thus, the new mechanics is still on unsteady soil.
So we are to wished it new conﬁrmations. Let us see
what astronomical observations give us in this con-
nection. The velocities of planets are, doubtless, rel-
atively very small, but, on the other hand, astrono-
mical observations exhibit a high degree of precision
and extend over long intervals of time. Small actions
can, apparently, add up to such an extent, that they
acquire values permitting to be estimated. The only
effect, with respect to which one could expect it to be
noticeable is the one we actually see: I mean the per-
turbations of the fastest of all planets – Mercury. It
indeed shows such anomalies in its motion that can
still not be explained by celestial mechanics. The shift
of its perihelion is much more signiﬁcant than calcu-
lated on the basis of classical theory. Much effort has
been applied with the aim of explaining these devi-
ations . . . The new mechanics somewhat corrects the
error in the theory of Mercury’s motion lowering it to
32′′, but does not achieve total accordance between
the observation and calculation. This result, is, thus,
not in favour of the new mechanics, but at any rate,
it also is not against it. The new doctrine does not
contradict astronomical observations directly”.

One can see here, how careful H. Poincar´e was in his estima-
tion of results. This was quite understandable, since the theory
was still under development, and therefore attentive and multiple
experimental tests of its conclusions were required. It turned out
that these equations were valid only when gravity was neglected.
Later A. Einstein explained the anomaly in the motion of Mercury
on the basis of general relativity theory, in which gravity is a con-
sequence of the existing curvature of space-time. But to explain

108

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

the anomaly in the motion of Mercury Einstein actually had to
renounce special relativity theory and, as a consequence, the fun-
damental conservation laws of energy-momentum and of angular
momentum.

From equations (9.12) it follows that the equations of classical
mechanics are valid only when the velocity v is small as compared
with the velocity of light. It is just the approximate character of
the equations of classical mechanics that has led to the origina-
tion of the Galilean transformations, that leave the equations of
mechanics unchanged in all inertial reference systems.

In three-dimensional form the momentum and energy have the

form

(9.14)

~p = γm~v, E = p0c = γmc2.
From (9.12) and (9.13) it follows that for a closed system energy
and momentum are conserved. As we see from formula (9.14),
energy E is not an invariant. It has been and remains to be
an invariant only with respect to three-dimensional coordinate
transformations, and at the same time it is the zeroth compo-
nent of the four-dimensional momentum vector in Minkowski.
As an example let us calculate the energy of a system of two
particles a and b in two different systems of reference. To proceed
so let us consider invariant

In the system of reference where one particle is at rest

= (pa + pb)2.

V

~pa = 0

we have

= 2mE + 2m2c2.
Here we take masses for particle a and for particle b as equal. The
same invariant is

when estimated at the reference system where the center of mass
is at rest

and

is a particle energy calculated in this system of reference.
E
When comparing these expressions we get a connection be-

tween the energies in these two reference systems:

2

E = 2 E

mc2 −

mc2.

The collision energy of two particles is used with most efﬁ-
ciency in case when the center of mass of the two particles is at
rest in laboratory system of reference. Just this situation is real-
ized in colliders. There is no loss of energy for the center of mass
motion.

One who has felt the four-dimensionality of space-time, could
have seen immediately that energy and momentum are combined
in the four-momentum. Moreover, he would have understood that
in the case of a closed system they obey the energy and momentum
conservation law.

In 1905 A. Einstein has proposed really existent quants of light
energy ~ω to explain photo-effect.
If he would understand in
deep the existence and meaning of the group, and so the require-
ment of relativity principle that physical quantities should be four-
dimensional, then he could introduce for light the quant of mo-
mentum in line with the quant of energy. Moreover that time it
was already proved experimentally (P.N. Lebedev, 1901) that the
light was carrying not only the energy, but also the momentum and
so it was exerting pressure on solid bodies. But A. Einstein has not
done this. The quant of light momentum has been introduced by
J. Stark in 1909. He took it into attention in the momentum con-
servation law. So the quantum of light the photon has appeared
(as a particle).

In formula (9.17) we have retained for energy only the positive
sign, however the negative sign of energy also has sense. It turns
out to be signiﬁcant in the case of uniﬁcation of relativity theory
and quantum ideas. This led Dirac to predicting the particle (po-
sitron) with the mass of the electron and positive charge, equal to
the electron charge. Then the ideas arose of “elementary” parti-
cles creation in the process of interaction, of the physical vacuum,
of the antiparticles (V. Ambartzumyan, D. Ivanenko, E. Fermi ). It
has opened the possibility of transformation of the colliding par-
ticles kinetic energy to the material substance possessing rest
mass. So the need to construct accelerators for high energies to
study microcosm mysteries has arisen.

From (9.18) it follows that the acceleration of a body, determined

does not coincide in direction with the acting
by the expression
force ~f . From the equations of Poincar´e relativistic mechanics we
have on the basis of (9.17), for a body in a state of rest

E0 = mc2,

where E0 is the energy, m is the mass of the body at rest.

From (9.17) it is evident, that mass m is an invariant. This re-
lation is a direct consequence of pseudo-Euclidean structure of the
space-time geometry. The connection between energy and mass
ﬁrst arose in relation to the inert property of the electromagnetic
radiation. Formula E = mc2 for radiation had been found for the
ﬁrst time in the article by H. Poincar´e in 1900 in clear and exact
form.

Let us quote some extractions from the article by H. Poincar´e
published in 1900 “Lorentz theory and principle of equality of ac-
tion and reaction” (double translation: by V.A. Petrov from French
into Russian and by V.O. Soloviev from Russian into English):

“First of all let us shortly remind the derivation

The ﬁrst integral in r.h.s., as well known, is the amount
of electromagnetic energy ﬂowing into the considered
volume through the surface and the second term is the
amount of electromagnetic energy created in the vol-
ume by means of transformation from other species of
energy.

We may treat the electromagnetic energy as a ﬁcti-
tious ﬂuid with density J which is distributed in space
according to the Poynting laws. It is only necessary
to admit that this ﬂuid is not indestructible, and it is
decreasing over value ρdV ~E~v in volume element dV
in a unit of time (or that an equal and opposite in sign
amount of it is created, if this expression is negative).
This does not allow us to get a full analogy with the
real ﬂuid for our ﬁctitious one. The amount of this
ﬂuid which ﬂows through a unit square surface ori-
ented perpendicular to axis i, at a unit of time is equal
to the following

JUi,

where Ui are corresponding components of the ﬂuid
velocity.

Comparing this to the Poynting formulae, we ob-

They demonstrate that the momentum of substance plus
the momentum of our ﬁctitious ﬂuid is given by a con-

In standard mechanics one concludes from the con-
stancy of the momentum that the motion of the mass
center is rectilinear and uniform. But here we have no
rights to conclude that the center of mass of the sys-
tem composed of the substance and our ﬁctitious ﬂuid
is moving rectilinearly and uniformly. This is due to

4In Eq. (C) the second term in l.h.s. determines the total momentum of the
electromagnetic radiation. Just here the concept of radiation momentum density
arises

and also the concept of mass density of the electromagnetic ﬁeld

(D)

Eq. (D) may be expressed in standard terms as fol-
lows. If the electromagnetic energy is created or anni-
hilated nowhere, then the last term disappears, whereas
the center of mass of system formed of substance and
of electromagnetic energy (treated as a ﬁctitious ﬂuid)
has a rectilinear and uniform motion”.

Then H. Poincar´e writes:

“So, the electromagnetic energy behaves as a ﬂuid
having inertia from our point of view. And we have to
conclude that if some device producing electromag-
netic energy will send it by means of radiation in a
deﬁnite direction, then this device must experience a
recoil, as a cannon which ﬁre a shot. Of course, this
recoil will be absent if the device radiate energy isotrop-
ically in all directions; just opposite, it will be present
when this symmetry is absent and when the energy is
emitted in the only one direction. This is just the same
as this proceeds, for example, for the H. Hertz emitter
situated in a parabolic mirror. It is easy to estimate
numerically the value of this recoil. If the device has
mass 1 kg, and if it sends three billion Joules in a sin-
gle direction with the light velocity, then the velocity
due to recoil is equal to 1 sm/sec”.

When determining the velocity of recoil H. Poincar´e again exploits
formula

M =

E
c2 .

§

7 of article [3] H. Poincar´e derives equations of relativistic
In
mechanics.
If we change the system of units in this paragraph
from M = 1, c = 1 to Gaussian system of units, then it is easy to
see that inert mass of a body is also determined by formula:

M =

E
c2 .

Therefore, it follows from works by H. Poincar´e that the inert
mass both of substance, and of radiation is determined by their
energy. All this has been a consequence of the electrodynamics
and the relativistic mechanics.

In 1905 Einstein has published article “Does the inertia of
a body depend on the energy contained in it?”. Max Jam-
mer wrote on this article in his book “The concept of mass in
classical and modern physics” (Russian translation: Moscow,
“Progress”, 1967,p. 182):

“Usually one says that the theorem of inertia in
its full generality has been ﬁrst established by Ein-
stein in 1905. (Max Born “Atomic physics”, Rus-
sian translation: Moscow, “Mir”, 1965, p. 72), in
this relation refers to Einstein article “Does the iner-
tia of a body depend on the energy contained in
it?”. On the base of the electromagnetic ﬁeld Maxwell-
Hertz equations Einstein states that “if a body gives
away energy E in the form of radiation, then its
mass decreases by E/c2”. Generalizing this result
onto all energetic transformations Einstein concludes:
“The mass of a body is a measure of the energy con-
tained in it”. A curious occasion in the history of sci-
entiﬁc thinking is the fact that Einstein own deriva-
tion of formula E = mc2, as it is given in his arti-
cle published in “Annalen der Physik” has been log-
ically incorrect. In fact, what is known to non-experts

122

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

as the most celebrated mathematical formula among
all discovered in science (William Cahn “Einstein,
a pictorial biography”. New York: Citadel, 1955.
p. 26), really has been only a result of petiti princi-
pia, i. e. an argument based upon a statement which
should itself be proved”.

“. . . The logical groundlessness of the Einstein de-
duction was demonstrated by Ives (Journal of the
Optical Society of America. 1952. 42. pp. 540-
543)”.

Let us consider shortly Einstein article of 1905 “Does the in-
ertia of a body depend on the energy contained in it?” Ein-
stein writes:

“Let there is a body at rest in system (x, y, z). Let
its energy related to system (x, y, z) is E0. Let energy
of this body related to system (ζ, η, ς) moving with ve-
locity v is equal to H0. Let this body sends a plane
light wave with energy L/2 (measured relative to sys-
tem (x, y, z)) in the direction having angle ϕ to axis
x, and simultaneously sends the same portion of light
in the opposite direction. In this case the body stays
at rest relative to system (x, y, z). For this process the
energy conservation law has to be fulﬁlled and fur-
thermore (according to the relativity principle) rela-
tive to both coordinate systems. If we denote energy of
the body after light emission measured relative to sys-
tem (x, y, z) as E1 and correspondingly energy mea-
sured relative to system (ζ, η, ς) as H1, then after ex-

Therefore, it is impossible to get nothing more substantial from the
initial Einstein equation (N). In this work A. Einstein has not suc-
ceeded in discovering neither physical arguments, nor a method of
calculation to prove that formula

M =

E
c2

is valid at least for radiation. So, the critics given by Ives on the
A. Einstein work is reasonable. In 1906 Einstein once more returns
to this subject, but his work reproduces the Poincar´e results of
1900, as he notes himself.

Later, Planck in 1907 and Langevin in 1913 revealed, on this
basis, the role of internal interaction energy (binding energy), which
led to the mass defect, providing conditions for possible en-
ergy release, for example, in ﬁssion and fusion of atomic nuclei.
The relativistic mechanics has become an engineering discipline.
Many accelerators of elementary particles are constructed with the
help of it.

“Disproofs” of the special theory of relativity appearing some-
times are related to unclear and inexact presentation of its basics
in many textbooks. Often its meaning is deeply hidden by plenty
minor or even needless details presented. The special theory of

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

relativity is strikingly simple in its basics, almost as Euclidean ge-
ometry.

Hence it is evident that, if the force ~f in a certain inertial Ga-
lilean reference system is zero, it is, then, zero in any other iner-
tial reference system, also. This means that, if the law of inertia
is valid in one inertial reference system, then it is also obeyed in
any other inertial reference system. Moreover, the conclusion con-
cerning the force is not only valid for an inertial reference system,
but also for any accelerated (non-inertial) reference system. Force
cannot arise as a result of coordinate transformations. If mo-
tion by inertia in an inertial reference system proceeds along a

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

127

straight line, then in a non-inertial reference system free motion
will proceed along the geodesic line, which in these coordinates
will no longer be a straight line.

In classical mechanics the force ~f is the same in all inertial
reference systems, in relativistic mechanics this is no longer so, the
components of force, in this case, vary in accordance with (9.28).
Let us, now, dwell upon a general comment concerning iner-
tial reference systems. Inertial reference systems being equitable
signiﬁes that, if in each reference system we create identical con-
ditions for the evolution of matter, then we, naturally, should have
the same description of a phenomenon in each reference system, in
other words, we will not be able to single out any one of the iner-
tial reference systems. But, if we have provided some conditions
for the motion of matter in one inertial reference system, then,
in describing what goes on in this reference system by observing
from any other inertial reference system, we will already obtain
another picture. This does not violate the equality of inertial ref-
erence systems, since in this case the initial reference system has
been singled out by the actual formulation of the problem. Pre-
cisely such a situation arises, when we consider the Universe.
In this case, there exists a sole physically singled out inertial
reference system in the Universe, which is determined by the
distribution of matter. Time will be singled out in this refer-
ence system as compared with other inertial reference systems.
This time could be termed the “true time” of the Universe. As
an example of a singled out reference system one could choose
a reference system, in which the relict electromagnetic radia-
tion is homogeneous and isotropic (see ref.[5]).

From the above exposition, especially from Sections 3, 5, 7, 8,
and 9 it is evident that Henri Poincar´e discovered all the essentials
that make up the content of special relativity theory. Any person,
who has graduated from University in theoretical physics and who

128

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

has attentively read at least two of his articles “On the dynamics
of the electron”, may verify this.

There exists, also, other points of view: “Poincar´e did not
make the decisive step” (de Broglie), “Poincar´e was, most likely,
quite close to creating SRT, but did not arrive at the end. One
can only guess why this happened.” (V.L. Ginzburg). But these
statements characterize the authors’ own level of understanding
the problem, instead of H. Poincar´e’s outstanding achievements in
relativity theory. What is surprising is that the authors show no
trace of doubt in considering their own incomprehension, or the
difﬁculty they had in understanding, as a criterion in evaluating
the outstanding studies performed by Poincar´e. In this case there
is no need to “guess”. It is only necessary to read the works by
Poincar´e [2, 3] and to think.

Professor A. Pais wrote the following in his book “The scien-
tiﬁc activity and life of Albert Einstein”, published in Russian
(Moscow, “Nauka” Publishing House, 1989, p. 162):

“. . . It is clearly seen, that even in 1909 Poincar´e did
not know that contraction of the dimensions of rods
is a consequence of two Einstein’s postulates. (sin-
gled out by me – A.L.) Hence it follows that Poincar´e
had not understood one of the fundamental proposi-
tions of SRT”.

We right away note that the underlined statement is wrong. But
about this – later.

From everything that A. Pais has written it clearly follows that
he himself did not understand the fundamentals of special relati-
vity theory. Let me explain. Poincar´e demonstrated the invariabil-
ity of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations with respect to the Lorentz
transformations, which was consistent with the relativity principle,
formulated by Poincar´e in 1904 for all natural physical phenom-
ena. As we already noted, H. Poincar´e discovered the fundamental

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

129

invariant (3.22)

J = c2T 2

X 2

Y 2

Z 2 ,

−

−

−

that establishes the geometry of space-time. Namely hence it fol-
lows, that the light velocity being constant is a particular conse-
quence of this formula, when the invariant J is zero. Professor
Pais had to understand that the Lorentz contraction is related to
negative J, i. e. to a space-like value of J, not equal to zero. As to
the slowing down of time, it is related to positive J, i.e time-like
J, but certainly not equal to zero. Thus, from the above it is clear,
that contraction of the dimensions of rods is not a consequence
of the two Einstein’s postulates only.
Such is the result of a
superﬁcial knowledge of the relativity theory foundations.

So with such a knowledge of material professor Pais has tried
to prove on the pages of his book that H. Poincar´e has not made the
decisive step to create the theory of relativity! He as a physicist
“reinforced” his view on the contribution of H. Poincar´e by the
decision of Paris Session of French Philosophical Society in 1922.
So simple it is! The philosophers have met and made a deci-
sion whereas they probably have not studied works by Poincar´e
on the theory of relativity at all. But their study required a cor-
responding professional level. I doubt whether their professional
level has been higher than one by professor Pais in this ﬁeld. We
should say that professor Pais was an outstanding scientist irre-
spective to this criticism and he made a lot of remarkable investi-
gations.

As to the Lorentz contraction, in the article [3] (
§

6 “The con-
traction of electrons”) H. Poincar´e deals with this issue in detail,
making use of the Lorentz transformations. All this is clearly pre-
sented in article [3]. Precisely uniﬁcation of the relativity and the
Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics permitted Poincar´e to formu-
late in articles [2] and [3] the foundation of relativity theory. As to

130

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

the postulate concerning the constancy of the velocity of light, it
proved to be just a simple heuristic device, but not a fundamental
of the theory. It is a consequence of the requirement that electrody-
namical phenomena, described by the Maxwell-Lorentz equations
in Galilean coordinates, be consistent with the relativity principle.
Professor A. Pais, mentioning the group character of Lorentz

transformations, writes (see p. 128 of the book cited above):

“Poincar´e, of course, did not suspect that someone
else (A. Einstein is understood. – A.L.) had already
mentioned the group properties of Lorentz transfor-
mations few weeks earlier. . . ”

But all this is absolutely incorrect. Article [2] by H. Poincar´e,
appeared in “Comptes Rendus” on June, 5, 1905, whereas the
article by A. Einstein had been sent to publisher on June, 30, 1905.
H. Poincar´e, discovered the group and named it as Lorentz

group. He wrote in article [2]:

“All these transformations together with all rota-

tions should form a group”.

In articles [2; 3] by H. Poincar´e, the group properties are widely
used for constructing four-dimensional physical quantities, pro-
viding the invariance of electrodynamics equations under the
Lorentz group. While in the article by A. Einstein only the fol-
lowing is told:

“From here it follows that such parallel transfor-

mations form a group, as it should be”.

There is no any other word on the group in the Einstein article.
From here his misunderstanding that electrodynamic quantities
should be transformed according to the group in order to provide
the invariance of equations required by relativity principle follows

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

131

naturally. But all this leads to the consequence that some physical
quantities become four-dimensional, for example, current density,
potentials, momentum, and force.

Striking “discoveries” are made by certain historians near sci-
ence. Here, follows, for example, one “masterpiece” of such crea-
tive activity. S. Goldberg wrote the following in his article (“Ein-
stein collection 1972”, M.:Nauka, 1974, p. 354. See, also: “The
British Journal for the History of Science”, 1970, vol. V, No.
17, p. 73):

“Poincar´e adhered in his works to the idea of ab-
solute space independently of whether it is accessible
for observation, or not . . . ”

“. . . In Poincar´e’s opinion there existed a privileged
reference system, in which the velocity of light was
actually constant: this system was the unique one”.

S. Goldberg attributes all this to Poincar´e without any grounds
whatsoever. Thus, back in 1902, in the book “Science and hy-
pothesis”, Poincar´e wrote:

“Absolute space does not exist. We only perceive

relative motions”.

“Absolute time does not exist”.

In 1904 Poincar´e formulated the relativity principle for all physical
phenomena (see Section 3 p. 25) and in 1905 established that, in
accordance with the relativity principle, the equations of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld remain the same in all inertial reference systems,
owing to the Lorentz transformations.

Thus the equality and constancy of the velocity of light is pro-
vided for any inertial reference system. All this is expounded in

132

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

the articles by H. Poincar´e [2, 3], which should have been stud-
ied carefully by S. Goldberg before writing about the opinion of
Poincar´e.

In evaluating the works [2] and [3], as well as the early
works of H. Poincar´e in physics, it is necessary to proceed only
from their content, comparing it with contemporary ideas, but not
to be guided by statements on the issue, even made by well-known
scientists, contemporaries of Poincar´e, since the level of many of
them was insufﬁcient to fully apprehend what Poincar´e has writ-
ten. At the time his personality was especially manifest in that
for him physical problems and their adequate mathematical for-
mulation joined naturally and composed a single whole. Namely
for this reason, his creations are exact and modern even after a
hundred years. H. Poincar´e was one of those rare researchers, to
whom natural sciences and mathematics are their proper surroun-
dings. The young people of today, who are prepared in theoret-
ical physics, can readily perceive this, if only they, at least, read
Poincar´e’s works [2] and [3]. What concerns the statements by
Professor A. Pais and Doctor S. Goldberg, we once more encoun-
ter, what we saw earlier – a clear attempt to attribute their own
incomprehension to the author.

Some authors wishing to stress the preceding character of
H. Poincar´e articles [2], [3] on relativity give two following quotes
from the book of W. Pauli “The theory of relativity” written by
him in young age in 1921:

“The basics of the new theory were concluded up

to some completeness by Einstein”.

“Investigations by Einstein contain not only all the
essential results from both papers mentioned, but also
a presentation of a new and deep understanding of the
whole problem”.

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

133

Below we will give a quotation from W. Pauli related to the same
subject, but written later, in 1955.

To the ﬁrst Pauli quotation it should be said that no further
completion of works [2], [3] by H. Poincar´e is required. All the
main results which contain the full content of the theory of relativ-
ity are formulated there and in the most deﬁnite form.

What about the second statement by Pauli, the case is just op-
posite. It is sufﬁcient to compare the content of Poincar´e and Ein-
stein, works to conclude that articles [2], [3] by Poincar´e contain
not only all the main content of the article by Einstein of 1905
(moreover Poincar´e has formulated everything deﬁnitely in con-
trast to Einstein), but also contain main parts of the later work
by Minkowski. What about words by Pauli on “deep understand-
ing of the whole problem”, it is just present in articles [2], [3] by
Poincar´e. For example:

“All forces behave in the same way as electromag-
netic forces irrespective of their origin. This is due
to Lorentz transformations (and consequently due to
translational motion)”.

In other words Lorentz invariance is universal. All the above in
full can be said about gravitational forces.

Further, Poincar´e discovered pseudo-Euclidean geometry of
space-time, revealed the four-dimensionality of physical quanti-
ties. He constructed the equations of relativistic mechanics, pre-
dicted existence of the gravitational waves, propagating with the
velocity of light. Then, what else “deep understanding of the
whole problem” may be spoken about?

1954:

“A bit more and H. Poincar´e, and not A. Einstein
would be the ﬁrst who build the theory of relativity in

134

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

its full generality and that would deliver to French sci-
ence the honor of this discovery.. . . But Poincar´e has
not made the decisive step and let Einstein the honor
to uncover all the consequences following from the
principle of relativity, and in particular, by means of a
deep analysis of measurements of length and time, to
discover the real physical nature of relation between
space and time maintained by the principle of relativ-
ity”.

In fact all this is just opposite to the L. de Broglie writings.
H. Poincar´e gave detailed analysis of time measurements already
in his article of 1898 “The measurement of time”, in particular,
by means of light signal. Later, in articles of 1900 and 1904 he de-
scribes a procedure for determination of simultaneity at different
points of space by means of a light signal in a moving inertial sys-
tem of reference, and therefore reveals the physical meaning of
local time by Lorentz. In 1904 in article [1] he was the ﬁrst who
formulated the principle of relativity for all physical phenomena.
In 1905 being based on Lorentz paper H. Poincar´e has discovered
the Lorentz group in articles [2; 3] and on this ground proved in-
variance of Maxwell-Lorentz equations under Lorentz transforma-
tions in full agreement with the relativity principle. H. Poincar´e
extrapolated the Lorentz group on all physical forces. Therefore
the Lorentz invariance became universal and valid also for grav-
itational phenomena. In article [3], being based on the Lorentz
group H. Poincar´e introduced pseudo-Euclidean space-time geom-
etry. So, the homogeneous and isotropic space-time arose which
was deﬁned by invariant

It was developed in relativity of time and length concepts, in sym-
metry of physical laws, in conservation laws, in existence of the

−

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

135

limiting velocity for material bodies, in four-dimensionality of
physical quantities. The connection between space and time was
determined in full by the structure of geometry. There is no such
a deep insight into the essence of the problem in the article by
A. Einstein. Following these ideas H. Poincar´e discovered equa-
tions of relativistic mechanics and predicted existence of gravita-
tional waves propagating with velocity of light. Therefore H. Poin-
car´e deduced all the most general consequences from the princi-
ple of relativity. There is not any idea from the 1905 work by
A. Einstein which has not been present in articles by H. Poin-
car´e. And also in realization of ideas the work by A. Einstein is
rather elementary. Though in fact the realization of ideas required
high level of analysis.
In H. Poincar´e works [2; 3] there is not
only the high level analysis and realization, but they contain also
much new which is not contained in the article by A. Einstein and
which has determined further development of the theory of rela-
tivity. How Lui de Broglie has not seen all this when reading the
Poincar´e articles? Compare writings by Lui de Broglie to writings
by W. Pauli of 1955 (see present edition, p. 137).

It is quite evident, that Lui de Broglie has not gained an
understanding of the essence of the problem as a matter of
fact. Though being the Director of the Henri Poincar´e Institute he
has to do so.

Being based upon opinions by Lui de Broglie Academician

V. L. Ginzburg writes:

“As we see, the position of L. de Broglie, referring
to the memory of H. Poincar´e with a deep respect and
with a maximal kindness, should be considered as one
more testimony that the main author of the SRT is
A. Einstein.

All this is strange. One would think everything is simple here: if
your qualiﬁcation admits you, then take the article by A. Einstein

136

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

of 1905 and the articles by H. Poincar´e, compare them and all will
be clear. Just this will be considered in details in further Sections.
And what about the quotation of L. de Broglie, it clearly demon-
strate his superﬁcial knowledge of the works by H. Poincar´e.

P. A. M. Dirac wrote in 1980 ( Einstein collection 1982-1983.

Moscow: “Nauka”, 1986. p. 218, in Russian):

“In one respect Einstein has advanced much fur-
ther than Lorentz, Poincar´e and others, namely, in as-
sumption that Lorentz transformations should be ap-
plied to the whole physics, and not only to effects con-
nected with the electrodynamics. Any physical forces
which may be introduced in future are to be compati-
ble with the Lorentz transformations”.

But just relating to this H. Poincar´e wrote in 1905-1906 in articles
[2; 3]:

“. . . All forces, despite of the nature they may have,
behave according to Lorentz transformations (and con-
sequently, according to translational motion) just in
the same way as electromagnetic forces”.

Comparing the quotation from Poincar´e with the words by Dirac,
it is easy to get convinced, that all this considered by Dirac as
the achievement by Einstein is contained in full in article [2] by
Poincar´e. Therefore the quoted statement by Dirac: “In one re-
spect Einstein has advanced much further than . . . Poincar´e” is
simply incorrect. Poincar´e was the ﬁrst who extrapolated Lorentz
transformations onto any forces of nature, including gravitational
ones.

The following, for example, is what Richard Feynman wrote
(see his book Character of physical laws. Moscow, “Mir”, 1968
(in Russian):

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

137

“Precisely Poincar´e proposed to examine what could

be done with equations without altering their form. It
is namely his idea to pay attention to the symmetry
property of physical laws”.

In 1955, in connection with the 50-th anniversary of relativity

theory W. Pauli wrote:

“Both Einstein and Poincar´e relied on the prepa-
ratory works of H.A. Lorentz, who came very close to
the ﬁnal result, but was not able to make the last de-
cisive step. In the coincidence of the results obtained
independently by Einstein and Poincar´e I see the pro-
found sense of harmony of the mathematical method
and analysis, performed with the aid of thought exper-
iments based on the entire set of data from physical
experiments”.

Compare this quotation from W. Pauli with words by L. de Broglie
of 1954.

The articles [2, 3] by Henri Poincar´e are extremely modern
both in content and form and in the exactness of exposition. Truly,
they are pearls of theoretical physics.

Now let us return to words by Academician V.L. Ginzburg (see
this edition, p. 94), further he says about the principle of relativity:

“. . . Moreover, Lorentz and Poincar´e interpreted this
principle only as a statement on impossibility to reg-
ister the uniform motion of a body relative to ether”.

This is absolutely incorrect in relation to Poincar´e. Let me

explain. This principle in Poincar´e formulation is as follows [1]:

“The principle of relativity, according to which the
laws for physical phenomena should be the same both

138

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

for observer at rest and for observer in uniform mo-
tion, i. e. we have no any method to determine whether
we participate in such motion or not and we cannot
have such a method in principle.”.

There is no term “ether” in this formulation of the relativity prin-
ciple. Therefore the statement by V.L. Ginzburg is a simple mis-
understanding. Let us present some trivial explanations in this
connection. It follows from the formulation of relativity principle
that an observer performing a translational uniform motion can
move with any constant velocity and so there is an inﬁnite set of
equitable reference systems with the same laws for physical phe-
nomena. This set of equitable reference systems includes also a
system of reference taken as the system of rest.

Then V.L. Ginzburg continues:

“. . . It is possible to go from above to consideration
of all inertial systems of reference as completely eq-
uitable (this is the modern treatment of the relativity
principle) without special efforts only in case if we
understand Lorentz transformations as transforma-
tions corresponding to transition to the moving ref-
erence system (emphasized by me. – A.L.)”.

To have in mind that Poincar´e has not understood that Lorentz
transformations correspond to transition from the “rest” system
of reference to the moving one is also a misunderstanding. This
trivially follows from the Lorentz transformations.

From the Lorentz transformations

x′ = γ(x

εt)

−

it follows that the origin of new system of reference

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

139

x′ = 0, y′ = 0, z′ = 0

moves along axis x with velocity ε:

x = εt

in relation to another system of reference. Therefore, Lorentz
transformations connect variables (t, x, y, z) referring to one sys-
tem of reference with variables (t′, x′, y′, z′) referring to another
system moving uniformly and straightforwardly with velocity ε
along axis x relatively to the ﬁrst system. The Lorentz transfor-
mations has taken place of the Galilean transformations speaking
ﬁguratively.

Let us consider in more detail the statement by V.L. Ginzburg.
He notes that “if one understands Lorentz transformations as trans-
formations corresponding to transition to a moving system of ref-
erence”, then “it is possible without special efforts” to go on to
“the treatment of all inertial systems of reference as completely
equitable (this is the modern treatment of the relativity principle)”.
But it is not so. This is not enough for the fulﬁlment of re-
quirements of the principle of relativity. It is necessary to prove
(and this is the most important) that the Lorentz transformations
together with the spatial rotations form the group. But we are
obliged for this solely to Poincar´e. Only after discovering the
group it is possible to say that all physical equations stay untouch-
able at any inertial reference system. Then all the corresponding
physical characteristics transform exactly according to the group.
Just this provides the fulﬁlment of requirements of the relativity
principle.

In connection with the quotation from Ginzburg (see this edi-
tion, p. 137) we will give some comments. Let us admit that the

140

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

principle of relativity is treated as a statement of impossibility to
register a uniform translational motion of a body relative to the
ether. What follows from here? First, from here it follows directly
that the physical equations are the same, both in the ether sys-
tem of reference and in any other reference system, moving with
constant velocity relative to the ether system. The invariableness
of equations is provided by the Lorentz transformations. Second,
as the Lorentz transformations form a group, it is impossible to
prefer one system of reference to another. The ether system of
reference will be a member of this totality of equitable inertial
systems. Therefore it will lose the meaning of the ﬁxed system of
reference. But this leads to the fact that the ether in the Lorentz
sense disappears.

Very often in order to stress that Poincar´e has not created the

theory of relativity one cites his words:

“The importance of this subject ought me to return
to this again; the results obtained by me are in corre-
spondence with those of Lorentz in all the most impor-
tant points. I only tried to modify slightly and enlarge
them.”.

One usually concludes from this that Poincar´e has exactly fol-
lowed Lorentz views. But Lorentz, as he notes himself, has not es-
tablished the relativity principle for electrodynamics. So, one con-
cludes that also Poincar´e has not made this decisive step. But this
is incorrect. Those authors who write so have not read Poincar´e
articles [2, 3] carefully. Let us give some more explanations.
H. Poincar´e writes in his article [2]:

“The idea by Lorentz is that electromagnetic ﬁeld
equations are invariant under some transformations
(which I will call by name of H.A. Lorentz) of the fol-
lowing form. . . ”.

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

141

Poincar´e writes: “the idea by Lorentz”, but Lorentz never writes
so before Poincar´e. Here Poincar´e has formulated his own fun-
damental idea, but ascribed it to Lorentz. He always appreciated
and celebrated extremely high anybody who gave a stimulus to his
thought, a joy of creation, probably as nobody else. He was ab-
solutely deprived of personal priority reasoning. But descendants
are obliged to restore truth and pay duty to the creator.

In the same article (see this edition, the footnote on p. 51) Aca-

demician V.L. Ginzburg writes:

“It is possible to suspect that Poincar´e has not es-
timated the Einstein contribution as a very substan-
tial one, and maybe he even has believed that he “has
made everything himself”. But that’s just the point
that we are trying to guess about the Poincar´e feel-
ings from his silence and not from some claims told
by him. ”.

One may readily ﬁnd out what Poincar´e has done in the theory of
relativity: for a theoretical physicist it is enough to read his articles
[2, 3]. Therefore it is not necessary “to guess” about the Poincar´e
feelings in order to answer the question: what he really has done.
Academician V. L. Ginzburg usually cites writings by W. Pauli of
1921, but surprisingly does not cite writings by W. Pauli of 1955.
Some people for some reason want to see only A. Einstein treated
as the creator of special theory of relativity. But we should follow
facts and only them.

Now let us consider words by professor Pais written in the

same book at p. 164 (see this edition p. 128).

“. . . Why Poincar´e has not mentioned Einstein in his
G¨ottingen lectures? Why Poincar´e has not wrote on
the role by Einstein in creation of the theory of rela-
tivity not in one of his articles? It is unthinkable that

142

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

Poincar´e has not understand the articles by Einstein
of 1905 after reading them. It was unbelievable that
up to 1909, when he was delivering a talk in G¨ottin-
gen, he had not been informed on the Einstein results
in this ﬁeld.
Is it possible that the reason is in his
petulance or professional envy?”.

There is a unique answer to these questions. After reading the
articles and books published by Poincar´e up to 1905 it is easy
to get convinced that there has been nothing new for Poincar´e in
the Einstein article. Being based on his own previous works and
on Lorentz investigations Poincar´e formulated all the main con-
tent of the special theory of relativity, discovered the laws of rel-
ativistic mechanics, extended Lorentz transformations to all the
forces of nature. But all this he ascribed to the Great destructor
H.A. Lorentz, because just his article of 1904 provided a stimu-
lus for Poincar´e thought. This was his usual practice. It is strange
that professor Pais addresses questions only to Poincar´e, and not to
Einstein. How Einstein decided to submit his paper on electrody-
namics of moving body if he knew papers by Lorentz of ten years
ago only and papers by Poincar´e of ﬁve years ago only? What
prevented Einstein from acquaintance with reviews published in
journal “Beibl ¨atter Annalen der Physik”, if he himself prepared
many reviews for this journal? 21 reviews by Einstein were pub-
lished there in 1905.

issues. 24 issues were published in a year. The review of the
Lorentz article which appeared in journal “Versl. K. Ak. van
Wet.” (1904. 12 (8). S. 986–1009) was published in 4th issue of
1905. This review contained Lorentz transformations also.

A review by Einstein on article by M. Ponsot from May is-
sue of French journal “Comptes Rendus” 1905. 140. S. 1176–
1179 was published in 18th issue of 1905. The same issue (S.
1171–1173) contains article by P. Langevin “On impossibility to

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

143

register the translational motion of Earth by physical experi-
ments”. In this article P. Langevin refers to articles by Lorentz of
1904 and Larmor of 1900.

Why Einstein never refers to articles [2, 3] by Poincar´e? By
the way, he wrote a lot of articles on the theory of relativity during
next 50 years. What personal qualities explain this? How is it
possible not to refer to articles, if they are published earlier and if
you exploit ideas and concepts from them?

Academicians V.L. Ginzburg and Ya.B. Zel’dovich wrote in 1967

(see “Zel’dovich — known and unknown (in memory of his friends,
colleagues, students). Moscow: “Nauka”, 1993, p. 88):

“For example, despite how much a person would
do himself, he could not pretend to have a priority,
if later it will be clear that the same result has been
obtained earlier by other persons”.

This is a quite right view. We are to follow it. Ideas and results
should be referred to that person who has discovered them ﬁrst.

How strange the fate happened to be, if one can say that, of the
works by Henri Poincar´e, “On the dynamics of the electron”,
published 1905-1906. These outstanding papers by H. Poincar´e
have become a peculiar source from which ideas and methods
were drawn and then published without references to the author.
When references to these articles were done, they always had noth-
ing to do with the essence. All those discovered and introduced by
Poincar´e, in articles [2; 3] can be easily found in one or another
form in articles by other authors published later.

M. Planck wrote in article of 1906 “The relativity principle

and the general equations of mechanics”:

“The relativity principle, suggested by Lorentz
and in more general formulation by Einstein means. . . ”

144

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

But after all this is incorrect. The relativity principle was ﬁrst for-
mulated in general form by Poincar´e, in 1904. Then M. Planck
derives equations of relativistic mechanics, but there are no refer-
ences to the Poincar´e article [3], though the equations of relativis-
tic mechanics have been derived in it earlier. If ever M. Planck has
not been informed on the Poincar´e work that time, he could refer
to it later. But such a reference to article [3] did not appear also
later. Articles by Poincar´e, [2; 3] did not appear also in the Ger-
man collection devoted to the theory of relativity. How one could
explain all this?

B. Hoffmann (see Einstein collection 1982-1983. Moscow:

“Nauka”, 1986. p. 218 (in Russian)) writes:

“I would very much like to know whether peo-
ple could create the SRT without Einstein. It is right
that Poincar´e has all the mathematical instruments
and even more of them than Einstein has applied in
his article of 1905, but in Poincar´e works the belief
in existence of the rest reference system (something
rest in ether) always presents. And so there is an im-
pression that Poincar´e and all his followers would an-
swer “yes”, if someone ask them is there a contraction
when something moves relative to ether. But certainly
all those who believe in that should think that rods
at rest would become elongated instead of contracted,
and according to Poincar´e one clock would go faster
and another would go slower. The reversible nature
of this connection is a very subtle point and it is quite
probable that people would never recognize this”.

All this is inaccurate or follows from misunderstanding of the
SRT basics. First, the SRT has already been discovered by Poincar´e
in articles [2; 3] according to the principle of relativity formulated
by Poincar´e in 1904 for all physical phenomena. In accordance

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

145

with the principle of relativity physical equations are the same in
all inertial reference systems. All inertial reference systems are
equitable, and so the existence of a rest system of reference is ex-
cluded. From this it follows that the reversibility is realized here.
Second, Poincar´e discovered the Lorentz group and the existence
of the inverse element follows from here, consequently, the re-
versibility follows from existence of the group. Third, in the SRT
constructed by Poincar´e really this fact – “the reversible nature of
this connection is a very subtle point” – is a trivial consequence, so
writing “that people would never recognize this” is an intention of
the author to see the problem there where it is absent. Moreover,
it is absurdly to ascribe his own misunderstanding to Poincar´e.

It is surprising to read a quotation from A. Einstein given by
G. Holton. G. Holton (Harward University) writes (see: Einstein
collection 1982-1983. Moscow: “Nauka”, 1986. p. 217 (in Rus-
sian)):

“A. Einstein himself said that neither Lorentz, nor
Poincar´e, but Langevin could discover the special the-
ory of relativity”.

If we trust G. Holton, then we see that A. Einstein without any
doubt think that he exclusively discovered the special theory of
relativity. Was it possible that he did not read the Poincar´e papers
[2; 3] where all the main content of the special theory of relativity
was given in the extremely deﬁnite and general form? Therefore
it is rather strange even such an appearance of this statement from
A. Einstein. But if we admit that A. Einstein really has not read
Poincar´e articles [2; 3] during next ﬁfty years, then this is also sur-
prising. How this could be connected with the “punctilious hon-
esty of Einstein” as a scientist which is described with a special
intensity by G. Holton?

The suppression of Poincar´e articles [2; 3] continued all the
twentieth century. The opinion was created that the special

146

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

theory of relativity is created by A. Einstein alone. This is writ-
ten in textbooks, including those used at school, in monographs, in
science popular books, in encyclopedia. German physicists as dis-
tinct from French physicists have made a lot of efforts in order to
reach the situation when A. Einstein alone is considered as the cre-
ator of the special theory of relativity and this scientiﬁc achieve-
ment as a fruit of German science. But fortunately “manuscripts
do not burn”. Articles [2; 3] clearly demonstrate the fundamental
contribution by Poincar´e to the discovering of the special theory of
relativity. All the following done in this direction are applications
and developments of his ideas and methods.

In 1913, a collection of the works of Lorentz, Einstein and
Minkowski in special relativity theory was published in Germany.
But the fundamental works by H. Poincar´e were not included in
the collection. How this could be explained?

In 1911 the French physicist Paul Langevin published two ar-
ticles on relativity theory: “Evolution of the concept of space
and time”; “Time, space and causality in modern physics”.
But in these articles H. Poincar´e is not even mentioned, although
they deal with the relativity principle, the Lorentz group, space
In 1920 in the article by
and time, determined by the interval.
P. Langevin “The historical development of the relativity prin-
ciple” H. Poincar´e is also not mentioned. How could P. Langevin
do that?

In 1935 a collection “The relativity principle”, edited by pro-
fessors V.K. Frederix and D.D. Ivanenko was published, which for
the ﬁrst time contained works in relativity theory of Lorentz, Poincar´e,
Einstein and Minkowski. However, the ﬁrst work by H. Poincar´e,
“On the dynamics of the electron” happened not to be included.
And only in 1973, in the collection “The relativity principle”
(with an introductory article by corresponding member of the USSR
Academy of Sciences Professor D.I. Blokhintsev; the collection

9. Poincar´e’s relativistic mechanics

147

the works of
was compiled by Professor A.A. Tyapkin),
H. Poincar´e in relativity theory were presented most completely,
which permitted many people to appreciate the decisive contri-
bution made by Poincar´e in the creation of special relativity the-
ory. Somewhat later, Academician V.A. Matveev and me decided
to rewrite the formulae in the articles by H. Poincar´e “On the dy-
namics of the electron” in modern notation, so as to facilitate
studying these articles.

In 1984, to the 130-th anniversary of H. Poincar´e his articles
“On the dynamics of the electron” together with comments were
published by the Publishing Department of the Joint Institute for
Nuclear Research, and later, in 1987 they were published by the
Publishing Department of the M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State Uni-
versity.

Henri Poincar´e is one of the most rare personalities in the his-
tory of science. A greatest mathematician, specialist in mechan-
ics, theoretical physicist; his fundamental works have left a most
brilliant imprint in many ﬁelds of modern science. He, moreover,
possessed the rare gift of profound vision of science as a whole.
At the beginning of the past century (1902–1912) several books
by Poincar´e were published: “Science and hypothesis”; “The
value of science”; “Science and method”; “Recent thoughts”.
Some of them were nearly at once translated into the Russian lan-
guage. These books are marvellous both in content and in the
free, extremely brilliant and illustrative manner of presentation.
They have not become antiquated, and for everyone, who stud-
ies mathematics, physics, mechanics, philosophy, it would be ex-
tremely useful to become familiarized with them. It is quite regret-
ful that for various reasons they were not republished for a long
time. And only owing to the persistent efforts of Academician
L.S.Pontryagin they have been republished and become available
to modern readers.

10. The principle of stationary action in

electrodynamics

Many equations of theoretical physics are obtained from requiring
the functional, termed action, to achieve an extremum. Earlier
(Section 2), the principle of least action was applied in mechanics,
resulting in the Lagrange equations. We must in the case of elec-
trodynamics, also, compose action so as to have its variation with
respect to the ﬁelds lead to the Maxwell-Lorentz equations.

Action is constructed with the aid of scalars composed of func-
tions of the ﬁeld and current. We introduce tensor of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld

∂Aµ
∂xν ,
which by construction satisﬁes the equation

∂Aν

Fµν =

Here Sν is the four-vector of current (8.9).

One must bear in mind, that the choice of density of the Lagrangian
function in the action functional is not unambiguous, however, it is
readily veriﬁed that adding to the density of the Lagrangian func-
tion an additional term in the form of the four-dimensional diver-
gence of a vector does not inﬂuence the form of the ﬁeld equations.
The Maxwell-Lorentz equations (10.2), (10.10) are invariant with
respect to gauge transformations of the potentials,

The density of the Lagrangian (10.5) we have constructed is

conservation law of current Sν (8.10), it only varies by a diver-
gence,

L′ = L

which has not effect on the ﬁeld equations.

From the point of view of classical electrodynamics the poten-
tial Aν has no physical sense, since only the Lorentz force acts on
the charge, and it is expressed via the ﬁeld strength ~E, ~H. How-
ever, in quantum mechanics this is no longer so. It turns out to be
that the vector-potential does act on the electron in a certain situa-
tion. This is the Aharonov-Bohm effect. It was observed in 1960.
The experiment was carried out as follows: a long narrow solenoid
was used, the magnetic ﬁeld outside the solenoid was zero, nev-
ertheless, the motion of electrons outside the solenoid was inﬂu-
enced. The effect is explained by the solenoid violating the simple
connectedness of space-time, which gave rise to the inﬂuence of
the potential Aν, as it should be in quantum gauge theory.

We shall now ﬁnd the equations of motion for charged parti-
cles in an electromagnetic ﬁeld. To obtain them it is necessary to
compose an action with a part related to the particles and, also, the

In order to ﬁnd the formula for radiation energy loss of a charge
with high velocity it is necessary to apply the Lorentz group, ac-
cording to which it is easy to make the transition from one system
of reference to another. To do so we consider the acceleration

10. The motion of a test body by inertia . . .

Formula (10.33) has been derived ﬁrst by Li´enard in 1898.

The equations of motion (10.22) in an external electromagnetic
ﬁeld do not account for the reaction of radiation. Therefore, these
equations are valid only for the motion of a charged particle in
weak ﬁelds. In 1938 Dirac took into account the reaction forces,
and this led to the equation

charge with mass m in a strong constant uniform magnetic ﬁeld
H. We admit that the circular charge motion is determined by the
Lorentz force only. So we neglect by inﬂuence of the force of
reaction on the motion. Let us write equations (10.35) in the form

If the energy of electrons and the value of the magnetic ﬁeld are
large enough, then energy losses for synchrotron radiation become
rather substantial. Synchrotron radiation is widely used in biology
and medicine, in production of integral schemes an so on. Special
storage rings for generation of the intense X-rays are constructed
(see more details in: Ya.P. Terletsky, Yu.P. Ribakov “Electrody-
namics”. Moscow: “Vysshaja Shkola”, 1980 (in Russian).).

The pseudo-Euclidean metric γµν is determined by expression (3.33).

(11.15)

We see that the motion by inertia of any test body, independently
of its mass, proceeds along the geodesic line, determined by equa-
tion (11.14). It is absolutely evident that in arbitrary coordinates
the geodesic lines could not be treated as direct lines, this is con-
ﬁrmed by nonlinear dependence of spatial coordinates xi(i = 1, 2,
3) on time variable x0. Motion along a geodesic line (11.14) in
Minkowski space is a free motion. Thus, forces of inertia cannot
cause any deformation by themselves. Under their inﬂuence
free motion takes place. The situation changes, when there are
forces of reaction, which counteract the forces of inertia. In
this case deformation is unavoidable.
In weightlessness, in a
satellite, deformation does not exist, because, owing to the gravi-
tational ﬁeld being homogeneous, in each element of the volume
of a body compensation of the force of gravity by the forces of
inertia takes place. The forces of gravity and the forces of inertia
are volume forces.

Physical forces are four-vectors in Minkowski space. But the
forces of inertia are not such, since they can be rendered equal
to zero by transition to an inertial reference system in Minkowski
space.

Now we shall dwell upon the issue of covariant differentiation.
In Cartesian coordinates xλ ordinary differentiation, for example,
of a vector Aν results in a tensor quantity

∂xλ = Bν

with respect to linear transformations. In arbitrary coordinates yλ

this property is not conserved, and, therefore, the quantity

will no longer be a tensor.

It is necessary to introduce the covariant derivative, which will
provide for differentiation of a tensor yielding a tensor, again. This
will permit us to easily render covariant any physical equations.
Covariance is not a physical, but a mathematical, requirement.
Earlier (see 6.13) we saw that of two vectors Aν, Bν it is pos-

sible to construct an invariant

The property of covariance of the equations has nothing to
do with the relativity principle. This has long ago been clari-
ﬁed by V.A. Fock [12].

Therefore, no general relativity principle, as a physical prin-

ciple, exists.

of a body with acceleration ~a with respect to an inertial reference
system in Galilean coordinates.

Now consider a reference system moving with constant acce-
leration. Let the inertial and moving reference systems have co-
ordinate axes oriented in the same way, and let one of them be
moving with respect to the other along the x axis. Then, if one
considers their origins to have coincided at t = 0, from expression

We shall now proceed to deal with the “clock paradox”.

Consider two reference systems. If two observers, who are in
these reference systems, compared their clocks at moment t = 0,
and then departed from each other, and after some period of time
they again met at one point in space, what time will their clocks
show? The answer to this question is the solution of the so-called
“clock paradox”. However, two observers, who are in different
inertial reference systems, after they have compared their clocks
at one and the same point of space, will never be able to meet in
the future at any other point of space, because to do so, at least,
one of them would have to interrupt his inertial motion and for
some time go over to a non-inertial reference system. In scientiﬁc
literature, and in textbooks, as well, it is often written that the
answer to this question cannot be given within the framework of
special relativity theory.

168

12. Relativistic motion with constant acceleration . . .

This is, naturally, wrong, the issue is resolved precisely within
the framework of special relativity theory. The point is that refe-
rence systems moving with acceleration in pseudo-Euclidean ge-
ometry, contrary to A. Einstein’s point of view, have nothing to do
with the gravitational ﬁeld, and for this reason general relativity
theory is not required for explaining the “clock paradox”.

Let us illustrate this statement by a concrete computation. Sup-
pose we have two identical (ideal) clocks at one and the same point
of an inertial reference system. Consider their readings to coincide
at the initial moment T = 0. Let one of these clocks always be at
rest at the initial point and, thus, be inertial. Under the inﬂuence of
an applied force, at moment t = 0, the other clock starts to move
relativistically with a constant acceleration a along the x axis, and
continues moving thus till the moment of time t = T1, shown by
the clock at rest. Further, the inﬂuence of the force on the second
T1 + T2 it
clock ceases, and during the time interval T1 ≤
moves with constant velocity. After that a decelerating force is
applied to it, and under the inﬂuence of this force it starts mov-
ing relativistically with constant acceleration
a and continues to
move thus till the moment of time t = 2T1 + T2, as a result of
which its velocity with respect to the ﬁrst clock turns zero. Then,
the entire cycle is reversed, and the second clock arrives at the
same point, at which the ﬁrst clock is.

We shall calculate the difference in the readings of these clocks
in the inertial reference system, in which the ﬁrst clock is at rest.
By virtue of the symmetry of the problem (four segments of mo-
tion with constant acceleration and two segments of uniform recti-
linear motion), the reading of the clock at rest, by the moment the
two clocks meet, will be

T = 4T1 + 2T2.

clock started to accelerate and the moment when the acceleration

ﬁrst clock.

Now consider the same process in the reference system, where
the second clock is always at rest. This reference system is not

Thus, we have everything necessary for determining the rea-

Owing to the symmetry of the problem, the information ob-

the moment they meet. Indeed, the reading of the ﬁrst clock τ ,
determined in the reference system, related to the second clock, is

which on the basis of (12.32) and (12.41) gives

rest, yields the same result as the computation performed in the
non-inertial reference system related to the second clock.

Thus,

∆τ = ∆T < 0.

(12.49)

Hence it follows that no paradox exists, since the reference system
related to the ﬁrst clock is inertial, while the reference system, in
which the second clock is at rest, is non-inertial.

Precisely for this reason, the slowing down of the second clock,
as compared to the ﬁrst clock, is an absolute effect and does not
depend on the choice of reference system, in which this effect is
computed.

The arguments concerning the relativity of motion, which were
used previously, in this case cannot be applied, since the reference
systems are not equitable. Qualitatively, the slowing down of the
second clock, as compared to the ﬁrst, can be explained as fol-
lows. It is known, that in arbitrary coordinates the free motion
of a test body proceeds along a geodesic line, i. e. the extremal
line, which in pseudo-Euclidean space is the maximum distance
between two points, if on the entire line, joining these points, the
quantity dσ2 is positive. In the case, when we choose an inertial
reference system in Galilean coordinates, related to the ﬁrst clock,
this means that the ﬁrst clock describes a geodesic line, while the
second clock, owing to the inﬂuence of the force, moves along a
line differing from the geodesic, and, therefore, slows down. The
same happens, also, when the reference system is related to the
second clock. In the case of transition to this reference system,
the interval somewhat changes its form. In this case the ﬁrst clock
again describes a geodesic line in an altered metric, while the sec-
ond clock is at rest, and, consequently, do not describe a geodesic
line and, therefore, slow down.

We have considered the inﬂuence of accelerated motion on the
readings of clocks and have showed their slowing down. But this

12. Relativistic motion with constant acceleration . . .

177

effect concerns not only clocks, but all physical, or, to be more
general, all natural phenomena. On this basis, interstellar ﬂights
become fantastically fascinating. Back in 1911, Paul Langevin
discussed in an article [13] the voyage of a human being at high
velocities, close to the velocity of light, subsequently returning
to Earth. In principle, this is possible, but it still remains only a
fantasy.

Let us now pay attention to the Sagnac effect (see more details
in: Uspekhi Fiz. Nauk – 1988. Vol. 156, issue 1. – pp. 137-
143. – In collaboration with Yu.V. Chugreev). As is well known,
the Sagnac effect in line with the Michelson experiment is one of
the basic experiments of the theory of relativity. But till now it
is possible to read incorrect explanations of this effect with the
help of signals propagating faster than light or with the help of
general relativity (see in more detail below). So we consider it as
necessary to stress once more purely special relativistic nature of
Sagnac effect.

Let us at ﬁrst describe the Sagnac experiment. There are mir-
rors situated at the angles of a quadrangle on a disk. The an-
gles of their reciprocal disposition are such that the beam from a
monochromatic source after reﬂections over these mirrors passes
a closed circle and returns to the source. With the help of a semi-
transparent plate it is possible to divide the beam coming from
a source into two beams moving in opposite directions over this
closed circle.

Sagnac has discovered that if the disk is subjected to rotation,
then the beam with the direction of its round coinciding with the
direction of rotation will come back to the source later than the
beam with opposite round, resulting in a shift of the interference
picture on the photographic plate. After interchanging the direc-
tion of rotation the interference bands shift in opposite direction.
What explanation was given to this effect? Sagnac himself
has obtained a theoretical value for the magnitude of the effect

178

12. Relativistic motion with constant acceleration . . .

by purely classical addition of the light velocity with the linear
velocity of rotation for the beam moving oppositely to rotation and
corresponding subtraction for the beam moving in the direction of
rotation. The discrepancy of this result with the experiment was
of percent order.

This explanation of the experimental results remained later
more or less invariable or even became obscure. As a typical ex-
ample we present a related quotation from “Optics” by A. Sommer-
feld:

“The negative result obtained by Michelson of course

tells us nothing about the propagation of light in ro-
tating media. In this case we should exploit instead
of the special relativity the general theory of relativity
with its additional terms corresponding to mechanical
centrifugal forces. If nevertheless take into account
that in subsequent experiments (by Sagnac and oth-
c are considered and
ers. – A.L.) only velocities v
only ﬁrst order effects in v/c are calculated, then it is
rather possible to avoid the theory of relativity and to
make calculations only classically”.

≪

We will see below that the explanation of the Sagnac effect
lies in full competence of the special theory of relativity and nei-
ther general theory of relativity nor super-luminal velocities are
not required as also any additional postulates. We will consider in
detail how to calculate the time difference between arrivals of the
two beams to the source be in the inertial rest system of reference.
We will also do that in the rotating with the disk non-inertial ref-
erence system. The results of calculations will coincide as should
be expected. For simplicity of calculations we will consider the
motion of light in a light guide over circular trajectory which cor-
responds to the case of inﬁnite number of mirrors in the Sagnac
experiment.

(12.50)

to zero for light, so we obtain the following

(12.51)

The beam moving in the direction of rotation is marked by index
“+”, and the beam moving in opposite direction is marked by “–”.
With account for the initial conditions φ+(0) = 0, φ−(0) = 2π
we ﬁnd the law of angle φ± dependence of the two beams on time
t:

φ+(t) =

φ−(t) = 2π

−

(12.52)

The beams will meet at time t1, when φ+(t1) = φ−(t1). Substitut-
ing (12.52) we obtain

φ+(t1) = φ−(t1) = π.

Then taking time t1 as the initial time and repeating our argu-
mentation we will ﬁnd that the next meeting of beams will take
place just at that spatial point where they have been emitted, i. e.
at point with coordinates φ = 0, r = r0, z = 0.

We emphasize that this result does not depend on the angular
velocity of rotation of the system of reference which is the rest
system for the source and mirrors.

180

12. Relativistic motion with constant acceleration . . .

The law of dependence of the angular coordinate of the source

by deﬁnition is as follows (for initial condition φs(0) = 0):

φs(t) = ωt.

(12.53)

Therefore, the meeting of the source with “+”-beam will take
place at time moment t+ determined by condition φs(t+) = φ+(t+)

(12.55)

It may seem from the form of Eqs. (12.54), (12.55) that the ve-
locity of light is here anisotropic and is different from c. But this
is incorrect. The light velocity is the same for both beams and it
is equal to c, and the different time of return to the source is ex-
plained by the fact that the source has moved over some distance
during the time of beams propagation (“+”-beam has travelled over
larger distance).

Let us now ﬁnd the interval of proper time between arrivals of
the two beams for an observer sitting on the source. By deﬁnition

Let us consider now the same physical process of propagation

form of interval in this system we will make a coordinate transfor-

Such a division of intervals is absolute, it does not depend on the
choice of reference system.

For a time-like interval dσ2 > 0 there always exists an inertial

reference system, in which it is only determined by time

dσ2 = c2dT 2.

For a space-like interval dσ2 < 0 there can always be found an
inertial reference system, in which it is determined by the distance
between inﬁnitesimally close points

dσ2 =

13. Concerning the limit velocity

With account of (13.8) and (13.10), from expression (13.7) we ﬁnd

dℓ
dτ

= c.

(13.12)

The quantities dℓ and dτ are of local character. In this case the
concept of simultaneity loses sense for events at different sites,
because it is impossible to synchronize clocks with the aid of a
light signal, since it depends on the synchronization path. From
(13.12) it follows, that the ﬁeld at each point of Minkowski space,
in accordance with the local characteristics of dℓ and dτ , have a
velocity equal to the electrodynamic constant c. This is the limit
velocity, that is not achievable for particles with rest mass, since
for them

dσ2 > 0.

This inequality is the causality condition. The causality principle
is not contained in the Maxwell-Lorentz equations. It is imposed
as a natural complementary condition. In 1909 H. Minkowski for-
mulated it as the principal axiom as follows:

“A substance, found at any world point, given
the appropriate deﬁnition of space and time (i. e.
given the corresponding choice of reference system in
Minkowski space. – A.L.) can be considered to be at
rest. The axiom expresses the idea, that at each world
point the expression

c2dt2

is always positive or, in other words, that any velocity
v is always less than c”.

H. Poincar´e has demonstrated the deep physical meaning of the
limiting velocity in his article [1] published in 1904 even before
his fundamental works [2; 3]. He wrote:

13. Concerning the limit velocity

187

“If all these results would be conﬁrmed there will
arise the absolutely new mechanics. It will be charac-
terized mainly by the fact that neither velocity could
exceed the velocity of light,7 as the temperature could
not drop below the absolute zero. Also no any ob-
servable velocity could exceed the light velocity for
any observer performing a translational motion but
not suspecting about it. There would be a contradic-
tion here if we will not remember that this observer
uses another clock than the observer at rest. Really
he uses the clock showing “the local time””.

Just these thoughts by H. Poincar´e and his principle of relativ-
ity were reported by him in a talk given at The Congress of Art
and Science in Sent-Louis (in September of 1904) and they found
their realization in articles [2; 3]. Also they underlie the work by
A. Einstein of 1905.

Signal from one object to another can only be transferred by
means of a material substance; from the aforementioned it is clear,
that c is the limit velocity for transferring interaction or in-
formation. Since particles, corresponding to the electromagnetic
ﬁeld, – photons – are usually considered to be without rest mass,
the quantity c is identiﬁed with the velocity of light. The existence
of a limit velocity is a direct consequence of the pseudo-Euclidean
geometry of space-time.

If we choose the function f ν in (13.2) by a special way as

follows

f 0(xλ), f i(xk),

(13.13)

then, owing such transformation, we do not leave the inertial refe-
rence system.

7Because bodies would oppose to the forces trying to accelerate their motion
by means of the increasing inertia, and this inertia would become inﬁnite in
approaching the velocity of light.

(13.18)

In an inertial reference system, ambiguity exists in the coor-
dinate description of Minkowski space, depending on the choice
of functions (13.13). This is the reason for arbitrariness in adopt-
ing an agreement concerning simultaneity at different points of
space. All such agreements are conventional. However, this ambi-
guity and, consequently, the arbitrariness in reaching an agreement
do not inﬂuence the physical quantities. Eqs. (13.16) and (13.18)

13. Concerning the limit velocity

189

show that in an inertial reference system the physical quantities of
time (13.8) and distance (13.10) do not depend on the choice of
agreement concerning simultaneity. Let me clarify. In formulae
(13.16) and (13.18), given any choice of functions (13.13), there
only arise Galilean coordinates X 0, X n of Minkowski space,
that correspond to the invariant (3.22). This is precisely what
removes, in the physical quantities of time (13.8) and distance
(13.10), arbitrariness in the choice of a conventional agreement
concerning simultaneity. Moreover, no physical quantities can, in
principle, depend on the choice of this agreement on simultaneity.
And if someone has written, or is writing, the opposite, this only
testiﬁes to that person’s incomprehension of the essence of rela-
tivity theory. One must distinguish between coordinate quantities
and physical quantities. For details concerning this issue see ref.
[6].

Let us demonstrate a particular special example of the simul-
taneity convention. Let the synchronization of clocks in different
spatial points is provided by the light signal having velocity c1 in
the direction parallel to positive semi-axis X, and having velocity
c2 in the direction of negative semi-axis X. Then the signal sent
from point A at the moment of time tA will arrive to point B at
time tB which is given as follows

tB = tA +

(M)

The reﬂected signal will arrive at point A at time t′

The conditional convention on the synchronization of clocks
and therefore on simultaneity at different spatial points accepted
by us corresponds to the choice of interval in inertial reference
system in the following form:

culating with them differentials dx0, dx and then substituting them

dX 0 = cdτ,

and it does not depend on the choice of functions (13.13), because
it is completely determined by interval (H) only. Any change in
coordinate values like (13.13) leads only to changing of the con-
nection between the physical time and coordinate values.

To any conditional convention on the simultaneity there will
correspond a deﬁnite choice of the coordinate system in an inertial
system of reference of the Minkowski space. Therefore a con-
ditional convention on the simultaneity is nothing more than a
deﬁnite choice of the coordinate system in an inertial system of
reference of the Minkowski space.

An important contribution into understanding of some princi-
ple questions of the theory of relativity related to the deﬁnition of
simultaneity in different spatial points was provided by professor
A.A. Tyapkin (Uspekhi Fiz. Nauk. – 1972, Vol. 106, issue 4.)

13. Concerning the limit velocity

Now let us return to the analysis of physical time dτ . Quantity
dτ characterizes physical time, which is independent on the choice
of coordinate time. Indeed, let us introduce new variable x′0, such
that

x′0 = x′0(x0, xi), x′i = x′i(xk).

Physical time determines the ﬂow of time in a physical process,
however, the quantity dτ exhibits local character in a non-inertial
reference system, since it is not a total differential and therefore
no variable τ exists.

13. Concerning the limit velocity

193

In this case, there exists no unique physical time with lines
orthogonal to three-dimensional space.
In a non-inertial refer-
ence system the interval dσ is expressed via the physical quantities
dτ, dℓ as follows:

dσ2 = c2dτ 2

dℓ2.

−

There exist no variables τ, ℓ in this case. Here coordinate quan-
tities arise which permit to describe any effects in space and time
in non-inertial system of reference.

In an inertial reference system dτ coincides, in Galilean coor-
dinates, with the differential dt, so in Minkowski space one can
introduce unique time t. It will be physical. Introduction of si-
multaneity for all the points of three-dimensional space is a conse-
quence of the pseudo-Euclidean geometry of the four-dimensional
space of events.

One can only speak of the velocity of light being constant, the
same in all directions, and identical with the electrodynamic con-
stant c in an inertial reference system in Galilean coordinates.
In an inertial reference system, in any other admissible coordi-
nates, the velocity of light will be the same, if time is deﬁned in
accordance with formula (13.8) and distance by formula (13.10).
In a non-inertial reference system the electrodynamic constant c
is only expressed via local the quantities dτ, dℓ. There exist no
variables τ, ℓ in this case.

It is often written that the principle of constancy of the veloc-
ity of light underlies special relativity theory. This is wrong. No
principle of constancy of the velocity of light exists as a ﬁrst
physical principle, because this principle is a simple consequence
of the Poincar´e relativity principle for all the nature phenomena.
It is enough to apply it to the emission of a spherical electromag-
netic wave to get convinced that the velocity of light at any inertial
reference system is equal to electrodynamic constant c. Therefore,
owing to its partial role, this proposition, as we already noted (see

194

13. Concerning the limit velocity

Sections 3 and 9), does not underlie relativity theory. Precisely in
the same way, the synchronization of clocks at different points of
space, also, has a limited sense, since it is possible only in inertial
reference systems. One cannot perform transition to accelerated
reference systems on the basis of the constancy principle of the
velocity of light, because the concept of simultaneity loses sense
for them, since the synchronization of clocks at different points in
space depends on the synchronization path. The need to describe
effects by means of coordinate quantities arises.

We, now, deﬁne the coordinate velocity of light

vi =

dxi

(13.24)

here ℓi is a unit vector satisfying the condition

χikℓiℓk = 1.

13. Concerning the limit velocity

195

In Galilean coordinates of an inertial reference system coordinate
velocity coincides with physical velocity.

In an arbitrary non-inertial reference system, for describing
physical processes it is possible to introduce unique coordinate
time throughout space in many ways. In this case, the synchro-
nization of clocks at different points in space must be performed
with the aid of coordinate velocity. In non-inertial systems it is
necessary to use coordinate quantities in order to describe phys-
ical processes because in this case physical quantities are deter-
mined only locally.

Consider a particle with its own angular momentum (spin) Sν. In
a reference system, where the particle is at rest, its four-vector
of angular momentum (spin) has the components (0, ~J). In any

SνUν = 0.

When the particle moves along a curvilinear trajectory, the

Thus, a force without torque, by virtue of the pseudo-Euclidean
structure of space-time, gives rise to the precession of spin, if its
action results in curvilinear motion in the given inertial reference
system. In the case, when the force is directed, in a certain ref-
erence system, along the velocity of the particle, no precession of
the spin occurs. But parallelism of the vectors of force ~f and of ve-
locity ~v is violated, when transition is performed from one inertial
reference system to another. Therefore, the effect of precession,
equal to zero for an observer in one inertial reference system, will
differ from zero for an observer in some other inertial reference
system.

15. The equations of motion and conservation

laws in classical ﬁeld theory

Earlier we saw that, with the aid of the Lagrangian approach, it is
possible to construct all the Maxwell-Lorentz equations. This ap-
proach possesses an explicit general covariant character. It permits
to obtain ﬁeld equations of motion and conservation laws in a gen-
eral form without explicit concretization of the Lagrangian density
function. In this approach each physical ﬁeld is described by a
one- or multi-component function of coordinates and time, called
the ﬁeld function (or ﬁeld variable). As ﬁeld variables, quantities
are chosen that transform with respect to one of the linear repre-
sentations of the Lorentz group, for example, scalar, spinor, vector,
or even tensor. Apart the ﬁeld variables, an important role is at-
tributed, also, to the metric tensor of space-time, which determines
the geometry for the physical ﬁeld, as well as the choice of one or
another coordinate system, in which the description of physical
processes is performed. The choice of coordinate system is, at
the same time, a choice of reference system. Naturally, not ev-
ery choice of coordinate system alters the reference system. Any
transformations in a given reference system of the form

x′ 0 = f 0(x0, x1, x2, x3),

x′ i = f i(x1, x2, x3),

(15.1)

always leave us in this reference system. Any other choice of co-
ordinate system will necessarily lead to a change in reference sys-
tem. The choice of coordinate system is made from the class of
admissible coordinates,

γ00 > 0, γikdxidxk < 0, det

γµν|

|

= γ < 0.

15. The equations of motion and conservation laws . . .

The starting-point of the Lagrangian formalism is construction of
the action function. Usually, the expression determining the action
function is written as follows

S =

L(x0, x1, x2, x3)dx0dx1dx2dx3,

(15.3)

1
c

ZΩ

where integration is performed over a certain arbitrary four-dimen-
sional region of space-time. Since the action must be invariant, the
Lagrangian density function is the density of a scalar of weight
+1. The density of a scalar of weight +1 is the product of a scalar
function and the quantity √
γ. The choice of Lagrangian density
is performed in accordance with a number of requirements. One
of them is that the lagrangian density must be real.

−

Thus, the Lagrangian density may be constructed with the aid
of the ﬁelds studied, ϕ, the metric tensor γµν, and partial deriva-
tives with respect to the coordinates,

L = L(ϕA, ∂µϕA, . . . , γµν, ∂λγµν).

(15.4)

For simplicity we shall assume, that the system we are dealing
with consists of a real vector ﬁeld. We shall consider the ﬁeld La-
grangian not to contain derivatives of orders higher, than the ﬁrst.
This restriction results in all our ﬁeld equations being equations of
the second order,

L = L(Aν, ∂λAν, γµν, ∂λγµν).

(15.5)

Note, that, if the Lagrangian has been constructed, the theory
is deﬁned. We ﬁnd the ﬁeld equations from the least action prin-
ciple.

method provides the possibility, also, to obtain differential conser-
vation laws: strong and weak. A strong conservation law is a
differential relation, that holds valid by virtue of the invariance of
action under the transformation of coordinates. Weak conservation
laws are obtained from strong laws, if the ﬁeld equation (15.12) is
taken into account in them.

It must be especially stressed that, in the general case, strong
differential conservation laws do not establish the conservation of
anything, neither local, nor global. For our case the action has the
form

15. The equations of motion and conservation laws . . .

The weak conservation laws we have obtained for the energy-
momentum tensor and for the angular momentum tensor do not
yet testify in favour of the conservation of energy-momentum or
angular momentum for a closed system.

The existence of integral conservation laws for a closed sys-
tem is due to the properties of space-time, namely, to the exis-
tence of the group of space-time motions. The existence of the
Poincar´e group (the Lorentz group together with the group
of translations) for pseudo-Euclidean space provides for the
existence of the conservation laws of energy, momentum and
angular momentum for a closed system [6]. The group of space-
time motion provides form-invariance of the metric tensor γµν of
Minkowski space.

Let us consider this in more detail. The density of substance

In general case Eq. (15.53) could not be written as an equality of

conservation law. But an expression of the form

where Aν is an arbitrary vector, is easy to convert into a divergence
form even in the Riemannian space.
From Eq. (11.25) one have

DλAλ = ∂λAλ + Γ λ

From Eqs. (15.62) it follows that if they are fulﬁlled, then the met-
ric is form-invariant

δLγµν = 0.

(15.65)

In case of pseudo-Euclidean (Minkowski space) geometry
Eqs. (15.62) may be written in a Galilean (Cartesian) coordinate
system:

∂µην + ∂νηµ = 0.

This equation has the following general solution

ην = aν + ωνσxσ, ωνσ =

(15.67)

−

containing ten arbitrary parameters aν, ωµν. This means that there
are ten independent Killing vectors, and so there are ten integrals
of motion. Taking

ην = aν

tion:

P ν =

Here P 0 is the system energy, and P i is the momentum of the

and substituting it in the initial expression (15.63), one gets the
following expression for the angular momentum tensor:

P σνλ =

(15.72)

quantity

where

M σνλ = T νλxσ

T σλxν

is tensor density, satisfying the following condition

∂λM σνλ = 0.

(15.74)

Therefore, we have been convinced, by deriving Eqs. (15.69) and
(15.71), that all these ten integrals of motion arise on the base of
pseudo-Euclidean geometry of space-time. Just it has ten inde-
pendent Killing vectors. There may be also ten Killing vectors in
Riemannian space, but only in case of constant curvature space
[6].

Note that conservation laws are automatically satisﬁed for an
arbitrary scalar (Lagrangian) density of the form L(ψλ, ∂σψµ) in
Minkowski space, that provides for the ﬁeld energy being posi-
tive, if we only consider second-order ﬁeld equations. I especially
recall this here, since from discussions with certain Academicians
working in theoretical physics, I have seen, that this is unknown
even to them.

As we noted above, addition to the Lagrangian density of a
covariant divergence does not alter the ﬁeld equations. It is also
possible to show [6], that it does not alter the density of the Hilbert
energy-momentum tensor, as well. On the contrary, the density of
the canonical tensor (15.49) does change. But at the same time the
divergence of the spin tensor density changes with it, also. The
sum of the canonical tensor density and of the divergence of the
spin density remains intact.

Consider, as an example [15], the phenomenon of light aber-
ration, i. e. the change in direction of a beam of light, when tran-
sition occurs from one inertial reference system to another. So,
in two reference systems, moving with respect to each other, the
directions toward one and the same source C will differ. Let θ and
θ′ be the angles at which the light from the source at point C is
seen from two inertial reference systems A and B, moving with
respect to each other with a velocity v. In Lobachevsky velocity
space we shall construct the triangle ACD (see Fig. 1), with angle
C equal to zero, since light has the limit velocity.

Usually the space metric in cosmology is written this form, when
dealing with the open Universe.

Further we shall dwell, in a descriptive manner, on certain the-
orems of Lobachevsky’s geometry, following the book by N.V. Eﬁmov
(“Higher geometry” M.: Nauka, 1978 (in Russian)) and the lec-
tures of N.A. Chernikov delivered at the Novosibirsk state univer-
sity and published in the form of a preprint in 1965.

In the Lobachevsky geometry, through point A, not lying on
the straight line a, there pass an inﬁnite number of straight lines,
that do not intersect line a, but not all these straight lines are con-
sidered to be parallel to line a. Let a be a straight line in the plane,
and let A be a point outside it (see Fig. 2), b and c are bound-
ary straight lines that do not intersect straight line a. Any straight
line passing through point A inside angle β will also not intersect
straight line a, while any straight line passing through point A in-
side the angle containing point B will necessarily intersect straight
line a. The straight line b is called the right boundary straight
line, and c the left boundary straight line. It turns out to be that
this property is conserved for any point lying on straight line b.
Precisely such a boundary straight line b is parallel to a in the
right-hand direction, and c in the left-hand direction. Thus, two

straight lines parallel to a can be drawn through any one point:
one going to the right and the other to the left. In the Lobachevsky
geometry, the reciprocity theorem is proven: if one of two straight

228

16. Lobachevsky velocity space

lines is parallel to the other in a certain direction, then the sec-
ond straight line is parallel to the ﬁrst in the same direction. In a
similar manner, it is established, that two straight lines parallel to
a third in a certain direction are parallel to each other, also, in the
same direction. Two straight lines, perpendicular to a third straight
line, diverge. Two divergent straight lines always have one com-
mon perpendicular, to both sides of which they diverge indeﬁnitely
from each another.

Parallel straight lines, indeﬁnitely receding from each other in
one direction, asymptotically approach each other in the other. The
angle α is called the parallelism angle at point A with respect to
straight line a.

From the law of cosines (16.6) we ﬁnd

1 = sin α cosh x.

In obtaining this expression we took into account that straight line
b asymptotically approaches straight line a, so, therefore, the an-
gle between straight lines a and b is zero. Hence we obtain Loba-
chevsky’s formula

α(x) = 2 arctan e−x,

here a is the distance from point A to straight line a. This function
plays a fundamental part in the Lobachevsky geometry. This is not
seen from our exposition, because we obtained the Lobachevsky
geometry as the geometry of velocity space. proceeding from the

The area S is expressed in dimensionless units, since the sides of
the triangle are dimensionless. In our exposition, the constant d is
unity, on the basis of the law of cosines (16.4).

From formula (16.41) it follows that in the Lobachevsky ge-
ometry the area of a triangle cannot be indeﬁnitely large, it is re-
stricted to the quantity d 2π. Thus, admitting the existence of a
triangle of indeﬁnitely large area is equivalent to Euclid’s paral-
lelism axiom. The areas of polygons can be indeﬁnitely large in
the Lobachevsky geometry.

The area of a spherical triangle in Euclidean geometry is

S△ = R2(A + B + C

π),

(16.57)

here R is the radius of the sphere. Comparing this expression with
formula (16.41), we see that formula (16.41) can be derived from
formula (16.57), if the radius of the sphere is chosen to be imagi-
nary and equal to the value R = id. This circumstance was already
noted by Lambert.

the quantities x, y are called Beltrami coordinates in the Lobachev-
sky geometry.

Passing to new variables ξ, η with the aid of formulae

The net of coordinate lines

is orthogonal. The area of the triangle in these variables is

For calculating the area of a triangle by formula (16.63) it is ne-
cessary to ﬁnd the geodesic (extremal) line in the Lobachevsky
geometry in coordinates ξ, η. To this end we shall take advantage
of the principle of stationary action.

Let us, now, construct a triangle in the ξ, η plane (Fig. 3).
The lines AB and AC are geodesic lines, that pass through point
(ξ0, 0). The angles A1 and A2 are inferior to the parallelism angle

We have obtained the expression for the area of a triangle S∆ in
the Lobachevsky geometry, that we earlier (16.41) made use of in
ﬁnding formula (16.55).

From the above we saw that the Lobachevsky geometry, cre-
ated by him as an “imaginary geometry”, has become a composite
part of the physics of relativistic motions, as the geometry of ve-
locity space.

The discovery of Lobachevsky had a great impact on the deve-
lopment of various parts of mathematics. Thus, for example, the
French mathematician G. Hadamard, in the book “Non-Euclidean
geometry” in Section devoted to the theory of automorphic func-
tions noted:

“We hope we have succeeded in showing, how Lo-
bachevsky’s discovery permeates throughout Poincar´e’s
entire remarkable creation, for which it served, by the
idea of Poincar´e himself, as the foundation. We are
sure that Lobachevsky’s discovery will play a great
part, also, at the further stages of development of the
theory we have considered”.

238

16. Lobachevsky velocity space

Beltrami raised the question: “Is it possible to realize Loba-
chevsky planimetry in the form of an internal geometry of a certain
surface in Euclidean space?” Hilbert has shown, that in Euclidean
space no surface exists, that is isometric to the entire Lobachevsky
plane. However, part of the plane of the Lobachevsky geometry
can be realized in Euclidean space.

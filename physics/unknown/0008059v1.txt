This  paper  describes  the  mechanical  design  of  the
downstream beam transport line for the second axis of the
Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test (DARHT II)
Facility.  The  DARHT-II  project 
is  a  collaboration
between  LANL,  LBNL  and  LLNL.  DARHT  II  is  a
20-MeV,  2000-Amperes,  2-µsec 
induction
accelerator designed to generate short bursts of x-rays for
the  purpose  of  radiographing  dense  objects.  The  down-
stream beam transport line is approximately 20-meter long
region  extending  from  the  end  of  the  accelerator  to  the
bremsstrahlung target. Within this proposed transport line
there are 15 conventional solenoid, quadrupole and dipole
magnets;  as  well  as  several  speciality  magnets,  which
transport and focus the beam to the target and to the beam
dumps. There are two high power beam dumps, which are
designed  to  absorb  80-kJ  per  pulse  during  accelerator
start-up  and  operation.  Aspects  of  the  mechanical  design
of these elements are presented.

1  INTRODUCTION

We  are  working  on  the  engineering  design  of  the
downstream beam transport components of the DARHT II
Accelerator  [1].  Beam  transport  studies  for  this  design
have  been  performed  [2].  Figure  1  shows  the  proposed
layout  for  the  elements  in  the  system  during  early
commissioning  of  the  downstream  components.  The
beamline  from  the  exit  of  the  accelerator  to  the  target  is
about 20 meters long. In the accelerator the pulse length is
about 2 µsec. However, only four  short  (20  to  100  nsec)
pulses  separated  b’y  about  600  nsec  are  desired  at  the
bremsstrahlung  target.  The  function  of  the  kicker  system
is to "kick" four shorter pulses out from the main 2-µsec.
The kicker includes a bias dipole operated so that the non-
kicked parts are deflected off the main line into the main
beam  dump,  while  the  kicked  pulses  are  sent  straight
ahead.  Focusing  elements  between  the  kicker  and  the
septum would complicate operation. Therefore, to achieve
a  narrow  beam  waist  at  the  septum,  solenoid  S3  must
"throw"  a  waist  to  the  septum.  The  first  3  meters  of
beamline  allow  the  beam  to  expand  from  its  5-mm

matched  radius  in  the  accelerator  to  2.25-cm  at  solenoid
S3.  The  system  is  designed  to  have  a  20%  energy
acceptance  to  transport  the  main  beam  and  most  of  the
leading  and  falling  edge  of 
the
accelerator.  The  proposed  system  using  a  quadrupole
magnet [2] allows for a larger beam pipe radius than the
more  conventional  septum  dipole  magnet  studied  earlier.
This increases the energy acceptance of the transport line
to the main beam dump.

the  pulse  exiting 

Work  on 

the  kicker  system  has  been  described
elsewhere[3].  After  the  septum,  there  are  four  Collins
style  quadrupole  magnets  to  restore  the  beam  to  a  round
profile.  Experience  has  shown  ejecta  material  from  the
target can travel the length of the accelerator. To keep this
material  from  reaching  the  injector  and  accelerator  cells
we have included a rotating wheel debris blocker that does
not  allow  direct  line-of-sight  between  the  target  and  the
upstream elements for times shortly after the pulse.

Finally the beam will be pinched to a tight focus at the
target to provide an intense spot of x-rays for radiographic
purposes.    Work  on  the  target  is  also  presented  in  these
proceedings [4].

2  TRANSPORT ELEMENTS

The magnets within the DARHT II transport line are all
water-cooled  conventional  dc  electromagnets  (except  the
bias  dipole  and  the  kicker  sextupole  corrector).  The
magnets are listed in Table 1.

The transport solenoids have external iron shrouds with
water-cooled copper coils.  Solenoid coils are wound into
individual two-layer “pancake” coils. Each magnet has an
even  number  of  these  pancake  coils.  The  pancakes  are
installed  in  an  A-B-A-B  orientation  to  minimize  axial
field errors.  The inside diameters of the solenoid coils are
sized large enough to fit over the outside diameter of the
beam tube flanges.

The septum quadrupole and dipole magnets have  solid
iron  cores  with  water-cooled  copper  coils.  The  Septum
Quadrupole  Magnet  is  a  four-piece,  solid-core  construc-
tion. The Collins Quadrupole Magnets are two-piece solid
cores with non-magnetic support.  The dipole magnet is a
three-piece, solid-core, “C” magnet.

The  alignment  requirements  for  the  transport  magnets
are  +0.4-mm  positional  tolerance  and  +3-mrad  angular
tolerance.  Steering  corrector  coils  will  be  installed  under
many  of  the  magnetic  elements  to  allow  for  small
alignment errors or stray magnetic fields.

3 VACUUM SYSTEM

The  vacuum  chambers  for  the  DARHT  II  Transport
Line  are  circular  beam  pipes  constructed  from  304L
stainless steel. The region from the end of the accelerator
through the septum has a 16-cm bore diameter. From the
septum  to  the  target,  the  bore  diameter  is  reduced  to
9.55 cm.  The  vacuum  seals  are  made  with  conflat  style
knife-edge flanges with annealed copper gaskets. The use
of all-metal seals is driven by the potential requirement to
in situ bake the transport vacuum system. In situ bake-out
may  be  required  to  minimize  adsorbed  gas  on  the  beam
tube walls, which may be desorbed by beam halo scraping
the  walls.  The  vacuum  design  requirement  for  the
transport line is 10-7 Torr pressure.

Figure  4  shows  a  side  view  of  the  septum  vacuum
chamber.  The  chamber  resides  in  the  region  were  the
beamline splits between the line going to the target and the
line going to the  main  dump.  The  chamber  is  formed  by
two aluminium halves that are then welded together at the
midplane.

the  septum.  Horizontal  view.  The  main  part  of  the  pulse
enters the Septum Quadrupole off-axis and is bent into the
Septum Dipole, it is then bent further into the main dump.
The kicked portion goes straight ahead though the Collins
Quadrupoles.

4 BEAM DUMPS

There are two beam dumps included in the DARHT II
downstream  transport  system;  a  main  beam  dump,  and  a
shuttle dump. The purpose of the shuttle dump is to allow
accelerator operations while personnel are working in the
target area outside the accelerator hall. The shuttle dump
will have a composite absorber, made up of a 3-inch thick
graphite  block,  backed  by  12-inches  of  tungsten.  There
will be additional shielding surrounding the beam stop to
absorb radiation.

The main beam dump absorbs the portion of the beam
that  is  not  deflected  by  the  kicker  system.  The  normal
horizontal  beam  size  at  the  main  beam  dump  is  8  cm.
However, the start-up parameters for the beam will not be
well  known.  We  must  therefore  provide  some  safety
margin.  First  consideration  is  to  keep  the  instantaneous
temperature  (temperature  at  the  end  of  the  2-µsec  pulse)
of  the  impact  area  below  the  damage  point  for  the
material.  At  1  pulse  per  minute  repetition  rate  we  can
manage the average temperature increase. We also desire
to  keep  the  neutron  yield  low  to  minimize  activation  of
components  and  simplify 
radiation  shielding.  The
construction  of  the  beam  dump  must  be  compatible  with
high vacuum as explained in the previous section.

5 DIAGNOSTICS

Throughout  the  beamline  there  are  beam  position
monitors  (BPMs)  to  measure  the  location  and  angle  of
trajectory  of  the  beam.  The  BPMs  mount  between  the
flanges  of  adjacent  transport  beam  tubes.  The  accurate
transverse location of the BPMs is critical to the operation
of the transport line and it is their positional requirements,
which  set  the  alignment  tolerances  for  the  beam  line
vacuum  system.  To  satisfy  the  BPM  requirements,  the
transport  line  beam  tubes  must  be  aligned  to  within  0.2
mm  offset.  Each  beam  tube  will  be  manufactured  with
fiducials,  which  allow  the  survey  crew  to  measure  and
position external to the centerline.

During  commissioning  rather  than  going  into  the
"target"  region,  we  will  have  beam  diagnostics  on  the
straight ahead beamline.  They will include a spectrometer
for  measuring  beam  energy,  and  a  “pepper-pot”  for
measuring beam emittance.

The septum vacuum chamber has several ports near the
septum  region  to  allow  characterisation  of  the  plasma
generated during pulses when the beam is spilt on nearby
walls.

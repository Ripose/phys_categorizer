We describe first results obtained with a track structure imaging system for measuring the ionisation topology of
charged particles in a low-pressure gas. The detection method is based on a time projection chamber (TPC) filled
with low-pressure triethylamine (TEA). Images of  ionisation tracks of electrons, protons, and heavier ions are
presented and analysed.

information about the ionisation topology along the
tracks  of  charged  particles  with  a  resolution  of  the
order of several  nanometers. In this contribution we
describe  an  imaging  system  which  is  capable  of
measuring these distributions in a low-pressure gas,
similar to tissue in its atomic composition. Details of
the 
dosimetry,
microdosimetry and neutron spectrometry as well as
the measurement principle can be found in [1].

in 

In  this  paper  we  present  recently  introduced
detector  improvements  which  allow  operation  in  a
self - triggered mode as well as a higher gain and a
larger  dynamic  range    to  simultaneously  measure
minimum ionising particles and light ions (p, d, a ) at
high  energy  loss  close  to  the  Bragg  maximum.
Furthermore,  we  show  measurement  results  of  two-
dimensional  images  of  charged  particle  tracks  like
ions.  These
electrons,  protons,  He  and  N 
measurements  enable 
the
energy losses (dE/dx  or  LET),  which  are  compared
to  calculated  data.  Finally  we  show  results  of  an
analysis  to  identify  different  particles  of  similar
energy  loss  by  measuring  the  lateral  width  of  the
ionisation track.

were selected, which show a high energy (several keV)  d -electron emission from the track core.
The ion tracks were obtained with a double step amplification [1] while the 90Sr -b
 - tracks were
measured in the new,  self-triggered  separated amplification gap device, which provides higher
light gain

sensitive  volume  of  the  chamber.   The  transverse
diffusion for a 10 cm long drift path in 10 hPa TEA
was  measured  to  be  in  its  minimum  3.0  mm,  which
corresponds to 120  nm  in  tissue.  The  longitudinal
diffusion    amounts to 2.7 mm (i.e. 110 nm in tissue
density).  Details  of  the  measurements  of    electron
transport  in  pure  low-pressure  TEA  can  be  found
elsewhere [1].
        The  device  previously  described  [1]  was
capable only of measuring in an externally triggered
mode. This implies that a separate detector registers
the  passage  of  an  ionising  particle  through  the
OPAC  and  triggers  the  optical  readout.  It  was
previously    planned  to  use  the  primary  scintillation
light  which  precedes  the  secondary  scintillation  by
several 10 ns to trigger the system.

The time difference between primary and secondary
scintillation  would  provide  the  position  of  the
primary  charge  in  the  drift  direction  [2].  However,
efficient  detection  of  the  primary  scintillation  light
could not be achieved, even in an improved device,
where  6  photomultipliers  simultaneously  view  the
interaction volume of the chamber.
         Therefore, to achieve self-triggered operation
of  the  OPAC,  the  two  amplification  stages  were
separated  by  an  additional    6  mm  transfer  gap  (see
fig.1)  which  introduces  a  delay  of  100–150  ns
(depending on the drift  voltages) between the rise of
the charge signal in the first amplification step and
the beginning of the light emission in the secondary
scintillation  stage.  The  charge  signal  of  the  first
stage  is  then  used  to    trigger    the  light  detection

system  for  the  scintillation  light  produced  in  the
second stage.

Another benefit of the separation of the two
stages is the decoupling of the amplification regions.
Otherwise photonic and ionic feedback would cause
secondary    avalanches  and  eventually  an  early
breakdown  in  the  detector.  Thus,  a  wider  stable
dynamic  range  at  high  gain  was  accessible.  As  an
example of the high gain achieved with this method,
see fig. 2, where the track images of heavily ionising
particles  (a,  b)  were  obtained  with  the  former
doublestep structure at maximum stable gain, while
the    images  of  weakly  ionising  90Sr    b
  –  particles
and its  secondaries  were  made  with  the  separated
amplification    steps  (c,  d).  The  much  superior  light
yield, which can be obtained with the new device is
particularly  obvious  at  the  end  points  of  the  fast
electron  tracks,  which    have  similar  ionisation
densities.

3. Measurement and results

Fig.3  shows  the  CCD  image  (upper  part),  and  the
corresponding  time  projection  measurement  (lower
part) of an 18 MeV nitrogen ion, which crossed the
sensitive  volume  of  the  detector  at  an  angle  of  45°
with  respect  to  the  optical  axis.  The  energy  of  the
heavy ion significantly decreases in the gas volume
of the detector, which leads to an increasing specific
energy  loss  dE/dx  during  the  slow  down  of  the
particle.  This  corresponds  to  the  increasing  light
yield  from  the  right  to  the  left    side  in  the  CCD-
image  in  fig.  3  and,  correspondingly,  the  larger
amplitude (UA)  of  the  photomultiplier  anode  signal
for shorter drift times D
t. The maximum dE/dx is at
closest  distance  from  the  amplification  stage  and
therefore the first to be displayed. A comparison of
the CCD image  and the anode pulse trail shows that
statistical  fluctuations  in  the    ionisation  density
(clusters),  visible  as  nodes  in  the  CCD  image,  find
corresponding  peaks  in  the  anode  signal.  The
duration  of  the  light  emission  was  measured  to  be
1975  ns  (50%  of  trailing  and  leading  edge).  The
applied  drift  field  of  6  V  cm-1  hPa-1  leads  to  an
electron drift velocity of 4.7 cm  m s -1 [1].  With this
drift velocity a projected track length parallel to the
optical axis (D s in fig.1) of  9.3 cm is calculated.
          Fig.4 shows the proportionality of the energy
loss dE/dx  of various particles  (p, a
, N, Kr)  at  low

Each data point was obtained by  averaging of about
50  tracks.  The  dE/dx  values  were  calculated  with
TRIM92 [3]. The heavy ions  (N, Kr) were observed
close to the  Bragg  maximum,  leading  to  relatively
large uncertainties in the calculated dE/dx due to the
large  energy  loss  fluctuation  (straggling)  of  the
particle on its way through the foils and gas volumes
preceding the sensitive volume of the detector.

To identify the particles, the energy loss dE/dx, and
the  velocity  of  the  particle  have  to  be  measured
simultaneously.  According  to  the  binary  encounter
theory  of  ion-induced    d -electron  emission  [4],  the
energy of the  d -electrons varies with the velocity of
the ion with

From eq.  (2)  one  expects  a  correlation  between  the
energy  distribution  of  the  ionisation  electrons  and
the  particle  velocity,  namely  that  heavier  particles
d -electrons  of  higher  average  energy
produce 
compared to lighter ions of the same dE/dx.  Due  to
multiple scattering, the flight direction of electrons,
which  is  originally  peaked  in  forward  direction,  is
rapidly randomised. The difference in the  d -electron
energy distribution of fast and slow ions of the same
dE/dx  must  then  lead  to  a  notable  difference  in  the
transverse  ionisation density distribution. Examples
of  the  transverse  ionisation  density  distribution
(expressed as lateral dose distributions) for different
particles of the same dE/dx can be found in [5].

To directly compare different particles with
the same dE/dx, in particular to identify the particles
due  to  differences  in  the  lateral  ionisation  density
series  of  measurements  with
distribution,  a 
a -particles  was  performed.  The
deuterons  and 
kinetic energy of the deuterons was 2.13 MeV, 1.03
MeV,  710  keV  and  550  keV,  the  kinetic  energy  of
the  corresponding  a –particle  was  25.6  MeV,  13.9
MeV,  11.0  MeV,  8.25  MeV  and  5.44  MeV
respectively.

The results of the comparison between the
calculated  dE/dx  and  the  light  yield    per  mm  path
length YL of this experiment are shown in fig.5. Two
different  amplification  parameters  were  used,
resulting  in  two  different  slopes  of  the  linear
dependence.  For each pair  of particles of the same
dE/dx,  the  difference  in  velocity  is  analysed  by
measuring the extension of the transverse ionisation
density  distribution. This  extension  is  obtained  by

4. Conclusion

We  have  presented  a  novel  technique,  based  on
principles  developed  for  high  energy  physics
experiments [6,7] for application in applied radiation
protection (dosimetry and neutron spectrometry) and
fundamental  research  of  radiation  action  in  matter
and living tissue in particular.
        We have shown that for light particles (p, d, a
)
at low energies  particle separation based on dE/dx
(or  LET)  analysis  and  lateral  ionisation  distribution
is feasible. In the further development of the method
we will try to derive microdosimetric quantities like
proximity  functions  and  lineal  energy  distributions
of virtually defined spheres from the imaged particle
tracks and apply this information to derive radiation
protection  quantities  in  environments  with  mixed
radiation  fields  like  in  nuclear  power  stations,  near
high energy accelerators or at high altitude.

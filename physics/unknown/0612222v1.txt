Abstract 

We present an intercomparison and verification analysis of several regional climate models (RCMs) 

nested  into  the  same  run  of  the  same  Atmospheric  Global  Circulation  Model  (AGCM)  regarding 

their representation of the statistical properties of the hydrological balance of the Danube river basin 

for 1961-1990. We also consider the datasets produced by the driving AGCM, from the ECMWF 

and NCEP-NCAR reanalyses. The hydrological balance is computed by integrating the precipitation 

and  evaporation  fields  over  the  area  of  interest.  Large  discrepancies  exist  among  RCMs  for  the 

monthly climatology as well as for the mean and variability of the annual balances, and only few 

datasets  are  consistent  with  the  observed  discharge  values  of  the  Danube  at  its  Delta,  even  if  the 

driving  AGCM  provides  itself  an  excellent  estimate.  Since  the  considered  approach  relies  on  the 

mass conservation principle and bypasses the details of the air-land interface modeling, we propose 

that the atmospheric components of RCMs still face difficulties  in representing  the water balance 

even  on  a  relatively  large  scale.  Their  reliability  on  smaller  river  basins  may  be  even  more 

problematic. Moreover, since for some models the hydrological balance estimates obtained with the 

runoff fields do not agree with those obtained via precipitation and evaporation, some deficiencies 

of  the  land  models  are  also  apparent.  NCEP-NCAR  and  ERA-40  reanalyses  result  to  be  largely 

inadequate for representing the hydrology of the Danube river basin, both for the reconstruction of 

the long-term averages and of the seasonal cycle, and cannot in any sense be used as verification. 

We suggest that these results should be carefully considered in the perspective of auditing climate 

models and assessing their ability to simulate future climate changes.

1. Introduction 

Since  the  climate  system  features  a  nonlinear  interplay  of  subdomains,  each  characterized  by 

complex  physical  properties  (Lucarini,  2002),  the  definition  of  strategies  for  the  improvement  of 

numerical  climate  models  is  a  critical  issue  in  the  climate  scientists  community.  This  has  been 

recently  evidenced  by  the  Project  for  Climate  Model  Diagnostics  and  Intercomparison  (PCMDI: 

http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov),  which  has  gathered  the  output  of  global  climate  models  produced 

worldwide  into  a  single  server  and  solicited  the  provision  of  simple  scalar  metrics  of  model 

performances (Lucarini et al., 2006a).  

The  auditing  of  a  set  of  climate  models  consists  of  two  related,  albeit  distinct  procedures. 

The first procedure is the intercomparison, which aims at assessing the consistency of the models in 

the  simulation  of  certain physical phenomena over  a  certain  time  frame.  The  second  procedure  is 

the  verification,  whose  goal  is  to  compare  the  diagnostics  of  the  models  to  some  corresponding 

observed (or quasi-observed) quantity. 

The  principle  behind  regional  climate  modeling  is  that,  given  a  detailed  representations  of 

natural  processes  and  high  spatial  resolution  that  resolves  complex  topography,  land-sea  contrast, 

and land use, a limited area regional climate model (RCM) can generate detailed regional climate 

information. This information is in principle consistent  with the boundary  conditions provided by 

the  large  scale  circulation  patterns  as  described  by  either  global  reanalyses  data  or  by  general 

circulation model (GCM) (Wang et al., 2004), within which the RCM is said to be nested (Chen and 

Miyakoda, 1974). Therefore, a RCM is supposed to act as a magnifying lens of the driving model, 

thus  allowing  for  the  representation  of  small  scale  features  that  could  not  be  represented  with  a 

coarser  resolution  (Déqué,  2000).  RCMs  are  based  on  physical  (and  possibly,  chemical)  laws 

represented by mathematical equations that are solved using three-dimensional grids. They usually 

include  a  description  of  the  most  important  processes  affecting  the  atmosphere  and  land  surface 

components  of  the  climate  system.  Many  of  the  processes  acting  in  nature  take  place  on  much 

smaller  spatial  scales  than  the  resolution  of  the  model  grid  and  cannot  be  modeled  and  resolved 

explicitly.  These  processes  include  radiation,  convection,  surface-atmosphere  mass  and  energy 

fluxes, turbulent diffusion. Their effects are taken into account using parameterizations, by which 

the  process  is  represented  by  deterministic  or  stochastic  relationships  between  the  area  or  time 

averaged effect of such sub-grid scale processes and the resolved scale flow.  

Regional  climate  modeling,  in  addition  to  the  common  issues  and  flaws  associated  also  to 

global climate modeling and related to the discretisation and parameterization procedures, faces the

serious  mathematical  complication  of  being  a  representation  of  a  problem  with  time-varying 

boundary conditions. The driving model tends to enslave the RCM on time scales depending on the 

size of the limited domain and constraints at all times the global balances evaluated over the whole 

domain  of  the  RCM.  This  implies  that  future  climate  projections  performed  with  RCMs  may 

critically  depend  on  the  driving  global  model.  Other  non-trivial  issues  arise  from  the  delicate 

process of matching the boundary conditions at the interface between the coarse and fine resolution 

models, where rather different spatial and time grids have to be brought to a common ground. Note 

that today, some models, such as ARPEGE, circumvent some of these problems by allowing for a 

smooth  transition  between  low  resolution-global  to  high  resolution-regional  by  including  a  non-

uniform  grid,  whose  resolution  gradually  increases  the  closer  we  get  to  the  area  of  main  interest 

(Courtier and Geleyn, 1988). For more detailed information on RCMs, see Giorgi et al. (2001). 

The assessment of the reliability of the current RCMs in the representation of the statistical 

properties of the hydrological balance of river basins is crucial, because of the relevance of water as 

a  resource  and  as  a  source  of  risks  at  social,  economical,  and  environmental  level  (Becker  and 

Grunewald, 2003). Because of the process of latent heat release, biases in the representation of the 

hydrological balance may in turn strongly effect mesoscale as well as synoptic scale meteorological 

processes: water is also an active, in a  dynamical sense, component of the climate system. 

In this study, 12 RCMs and the driving AGCM participating to the PRUDENCE project, and 

for  reference  the  ERA-40  (ECMWF)  and  NCEP-NCAR  reanalyses,  are  audited  in  their 

representation  of  the  hydrological  balance  of  the  Danube  river  basin.  Apart  from  its  primary 

relevance for the European history, economics, politics, demographics, cultural and environmental 

heritage,  the  Danube  basin  is  very  interesting    from  a  climatic    point  of  view  because  it  is  well 

within  continental  Europe  while  bearing  at  least  a  twofold  direct  relevance  to  the  Mediterranean 

region.  Firstly,  the  Danube  runoff  gives  a  relevant  contribution  of  freshwater  flux  into  the 

Mediterranean sea (on the average, more than twice the Nile’s contribution). Secondly, the Danube 

depends mostly on precipitated water of Mediterranean origin, because of the geographical position 

(downwind of the dominant westerlies) and the complex orography of the basin, (Speranza, 2002). 

When considering the very intense precipitative and disastrous floodings events in central Europe 

inside and near the Danube basin (Becker and Grunewald, 2003; Stohl and James, 2004), it is well 

recognized the relevance of the Alps and of the Mediterranean waters in modifying and enhancing 

the storms of Atlantic origin (Speranza et al, 1985; Tibaldi et al., 1990).  

The size is a critical parameter in the choice of a basin as the object of an auditing study of 

RCMs in terms of water balance. If the basin is so small that only few grid points are contained, we 

may  expect  to  face  noisy  data,  since  the  real  physical  resolution  of  a  model  is  not  given  by  the

distance  of  neighboring  grid-points.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  size  of  the  basin  is  so  large  that  it 

represents a relevant portion of the whole domain of the RCMs, we may expect that all diagnostics 

are  heavily  constrained  by  the  behavior  of  the  driving  model.  In  this  sense,  the  Danube  basin  is 

neither too small, nor too large.  

The auditing process of the RCMs can in principle underline characteristic features or flaws, 

on  one  side,  of  the  large  scale  water  vapor  transport,  and,  on  the  other  side,  of  the  model 

representation  of  some  severely  parameterized  processes  occurring  in  the  atmosphere,  (e.g. 

hydrometeors formation and precipitation), at the surface-atmosphere interface, (e.g. evaporation), 

and  inside  the  soil  (e.g.  water  transport).  In  nature,  the  2D+1D  (space  and  time)  fields  of  main 

interest for evaluating the hydrological balance are characterized by complex statistical properties, 

since  precipitation  features  temporal  intermittency  and  spatial  multifractal  nature  (Deidda,  1999; 

2000),  evaporation  and  runoff  depend  very  delicately  on  the  local  conditions.  Therefore,  only 

robust,  suitably  coarse-grain  averaged  quantities  should  be  considered  in  the  auditing  procedure 

both  in  terms  of  intercomparison  and  verification,  since  comparisons  at  face  value  of  model  vs. 

model  and,  especially,  of  model  vs.  observation  can  be  misleading  (Accadia  et  al.,  2003). 

Nevertheless,  the  procedure  of  verification,  as opposed  to  the  model  intercomparison,  faces  some 

serious  problems  if  we  consider  actual  observations  of  precipitation,  evaporation,  and  runoff. 

Spatial averages of the water balance for the area of interest cannot be determined with reliability 

from the scattered time series measurements of the surface characteristics. Re-mappings into grids 

of the climatology of precipitations, allowing for the computation of integrated values, have been 

proposed only for precipitation (Mitchell and Jones, 2005, Efthymiadis et al., 2006). Consequently, 

the verification of the climatology can be more naturally performed using a variable of more strict 

hydrological interest and of much easier experimental access, such as the discharge of the Danube 

at  its  Delta.  This  is  possible  because,  when  averages  over  sufficiently  long  time  scales  are 

considered,  the  conservation  of  the  water  mass  implies  that  the  basin  integrated  value  of  the 

difference between precipitation and evaporation must be equal to the basin integrated value of the 

surface and subsurface runoff, and both must be equal to the river discharge at the end of its course. 

This  quantity  is  also  equal  to  the  convergence  of  water  vapor  in  the  atmosphere  over  the  basin, 

which  is  strongly  constrained  by  large-scale  meteorological  processes.  This  emphasizes  the  need  

for framing  the hydrological cycle in meteorological rather than in purely geographical terms. 

Several  studies  focusing  on 

the 

intercomparison  and  verification  of 

the  hydro-

meteorological characteristics and hydrological cycle over specific basins and on various different 

times  scale  using  GCMs,  RCMs,  and  reanalyses  have  been  recently  proposed.  We  may  mention, 

certain of making an incomplete list, the papers by  Roads et al. (1994), Lau et al. (1996), Gutowski

et al. (1997), Betts et al. (1999, 2003), Roads and Betts (1999), Hagemann et al. (2004), Hirschi et 

al. (2006). In these analyses, a combination of techniques such as the evaluation of integrated values 

of the convergence of atmospheric water vapor, of precipitation minus evaporation, of runoff, of the 

variation  of  terrestrial  water  have  been  employed  for  large  scale  basins.  In  particular,  the 

remarkable and encyclopedic paper by Hirschi et al. (2006) provides a rather complete analysis of 

the mean climatology of the water balance by diagnosing  37 (!) world major river basins, including 

the Danube, and providing a dataset of basin-scale water-balance, which is available for download  

through Internet. 

We  believe  that  this  paper,  which  presents  some  of  the  results  of  the  2006-2007  EU 

INTERREG IIIB-CADSES project  HYDROCARE (http://www.hydrocare-cadses.net), can give a 

novel contribution by presenting a more detailed analysis of the specific performances of a rather 

large number of models in their representation of the statistical properties of the water balance data 

over the Danube basin. Apart from the usual evaluation of the seasonal cycle of the water balance, 

for  all  datasets  we  compute  in  two  independent  ways  its  long-term  averages  and  the  95% 

confidence  interval  of  the  annual  average;  we  analyze  statistically  the  precipitation-evaporation 

feedback;  we  evaluate  the  impact  of  North  Atlantic  Oscillation  (NAO)  and  El-Niño-Southern 

Oscillation  (ENSO)  variability,  and  we  evaluate  quantitatively  the  statistical  relationship  between 

the  water  balance  of  all  RCMs  and  what  predicted  by  the  AGCM  they  are  driven  by,  in  order  to 

estimate the improvement of the information obtained by means of  the nesting procedure. 

The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, basic information about the Danube Basin, 

the  data  considered  in  this  study  and  the  concepts  behind  the  diagnostics  tools  employed  in  the 

auditing  are  presented.  In  Section  3  and  4  we  present  and  discuss  the  main  results  on  the 

intercomparison and verification of the models, respectively regarding the yearly and the monthly 

climatology of the precipitation, evaporation, water balance and runoff. In Section 5 we draw our 

conclusions and present perspective for future research in this field. 

2.a Notes on the Danube river basin 

The location of the Danube river basin is shown in Figure 1. The Danube river is about 2850 km 
long, its 1961-1990 average discharge is about 6600 m3.s-1, and its basin covers about 800,000 km2

Czech Republic, Switzerland, Italy, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania, FYR of Macedonia) – 

about  one-third  of  continental  Europe  outside  Russia.  The  Danube  is  the  most  international  river 

basin  in  the  world  and  is  the  subject  of  a  huge  number  of  international  projects,  including  the 

UNDP/GEF  Danube  Regional  Project  (http://www.undp-drp.org/drp/index.html)  and  International 

Commissions,  including  the  International  Commission  for  the  Protection  of  the  Danube  River 

(http://www.icpdr.org/),  just  to  name  a  few.  The  Danube  catchment  encompasses  continental 

climate,  as  it  is  land-dominated  by  advection  from  the  surrounding  land  areas  (especially  central 

and eastern regions). Only the western parts of the upper basin, in Germany, are influenced by the 

Atlantic climate and the south-west of the basin (ex-Yugoslavian countries) by the Mediterranean 

climate. The Alps in the west, the Dinaric-Balkan mountain chains in the south and the Carpathian 

mountain bow in the eastern center are distinctive morphological and climatic regions and barriers. 

These  mountain  chains  receive  the  highest  annual  precipitation  (1,000-3,200  mm  per  year)  while 

the  inner  and  outer  basins  (Vienna  basin,  Pannonian  basin,  Romanian  and  Prut  low  plains),  the 

lowlands and the delta region are very dry (350-600 mm per year). 

The following data sources relative to the 1961-1990 time-frame have been used for the purposes of 

2.b Datasets   

our analysis: 

1.  Daily  values  of  Runoff  (R),  Precipitation  (P),  Evaporation  (E),  from  9  Regional  Climate 

Models (RCMs) (see Table1), driven at the boundaries by the HadAM3H AGCM in the A2 

scenario (see below). Two RCMs (DMI and SMI) provide output data resulting from runs 

where  various  resolutions  are  adopted  for  the  models,  so  that  a  total  of  12  runs  are 

considered.  The  grids  of  all  models  are  defined  in  terms  of  a  rotated  coordinate  systems, 

allowing  for  having  quasi-square  grids  over  Europe  in  both  the  natural  and  the  angular 

metrics. The whole of Europe is well-inside the domain of the RCMs, as shown for a typical 

case  (PROMES  UCM),  in  Fig.  1c.  The  data  have  been  produced  in  the  context  of  the  5th 

Framework  Programme  of  the  EU  project  named  PRUDENCE  and  have  been  obtained 

through 

the  PRUDENCE  website,  which  contains 

information  about 

the  RCMs 

(http://prudence.dmi.dk). 

2.  Daily  values  of  precipitation  (P)  and  evaporation  (E),  from  the  HadAM3H  atmospheric 

general circulation model (AGCM), forced (scenario A2) by the  observed and reconstructed 

boundary conditions at the atmospheric interfaces (see Table 2). HadAM3H is an improved 

version  of  the  atmospheric  component  of  the  Hadley  Centre  coupled  atmospheric-ocean

directly from MetOffice, Hadley Centre, UK. 

3.  Daily  values  of  runoff  (R),  precipitation  (P),  Evaporation  (E)  from  2  major  reanalysis 

datasets  (see  Table  2):  the  ERA-40  reanalysis  released  by  the  European  Center  for  Mid-

Range  Weather  Forecast  (ECMWF)  (Simmons  and  Gibson  2000)  and  the  NCEP-NCAR 

reanalysis  produced  by  the  National  Center  for  Environmental  Prediction  (NCEP),  in 

collaboration  with  the  National  Center  for  Atmospheric  Research  (NCAR)  (Kistler  et  al. 

2001). For the latter reanalysis E data has been obtained straightforwardly from the Latent 

Heat 

Flux 

data. 

The 

data 

have 

been 

downloaded 

from 

http://data.ecmwf.int/data/d/era40_daily/ 

(ERA-40) 

and  

http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cdc/reanalysis/reanalysis.shtml  (NCEP-NCAR) 

4.  Daily  discharge  (D)  of  the  Danube  river  at  the  near-sea  Ceatal  Izmail  station  (45.22°N, 

28.73°E)  (see  Table  2).  Data  have  been  obtained  from  the  Global  Runoff  Data  Center 

(GRDC), Germany (http://grdc.bafg.de/). 

Note that the PRUDENCE datasets comprises outputs of other RCMs; for matter of consistency and 

with the purpose of limiting spurious effects due to the boundary conditions, we have selected the 

largest subset of runs that are nested in the same simulation of a single AGCM.  

2.c Notes on the Theoretical framework   

We proceed along the lines of Peixoto and Oort (1992). By imposing mass conservation for water, 

we obtain the following expression for the local  balance equation of the terrestrial water: 

=

REP
−−

where S represents the terrestrial water storage per unit area, R the runoff (including the surface and 

the subsurface runoff of the area), P is precipitation, E is evaporation. In this work by evaporation 

we  mean  the  total  evaporation,  thus  including  transpiration.  When  considering  an  atmospheric 

column stretching from surface to the top of the atmosphere, we have that the balance equation can 

be written as follows:

where  B=P-E  is  the  net  balance  and  D  is  the  actual  river  discharge  into  the  sea.  Note  that, 

considering  using  Gauss’  integral  theorem,  we  also  have  that  the  time-averaged  river  discharge 

equals  the  time  average  of  the  net  incoming  atmospheric  flux  of  water  through  the  vertical 

boundaries  of  the  atmospheric  region  bounded  below  by  the  region  A:  in  a  way,  the  river  flows 

down from the sky. Equations (5) form the basis of the diagnostic study presented in this paper.

We now describe the data processing procedure adopted in this work for each model output 

allowing for the independent estimates of the daily time-series of the basin-integrated values of the 

precipitation, evaporation, and runoff fields, to be used for studying the validity of Equation (5) in 

the  analyzed  datasets.  MATLAB  7.0.4®,  MS  Office  Excel®  and  ArcGIS  9.0®  software  packages 

have been used with customized routines. The first step after data collection grounds in reading the 

converting  the  input  data  (P,  E,  R),  from  the  .NC  format  to  .MAT  format,  which  is  the  standard 

format for MATLAB 7.0.4® software. This is accomplished by using the netCDF tool available at 

http://www.marine.csiro.au/sw/matlab-netcdf.html.  In  the  MATLAB  7.0.4®  environment,  the 

numerical  manipulations  of  the  raw  data  are  performed  in  order  to  obtain  the  climatology  of  the 

gridded data. Then, the outputs are transferred to MS Office Excel®, where DBF files are created, 

and, subsequently, these are imported into ArcGIS 9.0® software. In GIS environment, a new point 

layer of all characteristics is created (Figure 1a).  

The final step – the numerical integration of the fields - can be performed by adopting two 

conceptually distinct strategies. The first approach relies on considering, for a given grid-point, the 

analyzed field as constant within the corresponding grid-cell centered on the grid point. Then, all 

the contributions coming from cells contained inside the geographical domain of the river basin are 

summed  up  with  a  weight  corresponding  to  the  area  of  the  cell,  while  the  contributions  from  the 

boundary cell (not entirely contained in the basin) are weighted with the portion of the area of the 

cell  inside  the  basin.  The  cells  can  be  defined  in  general  terms  by  producing  the  Voronoi  or 

Thiessen tessellation (Okabe et al., 2000) of the grid, where the grid-cell corresponding to a grid-

point is defined as the set of points that are closer to that grid-point than to any of the other ones. In 

the  cases  considered  in  this  study,  since  the  grids  are  locally  quasi-rectangular  (actually,  quasi-

square) in the natural metric, the Voronoi tessellation is such that the grid cell corresponding to the 
grid-point  (

approximations,  that  the  total  water  flux  is  computed  exactly  (Figure  1b).  The  second  approach, 

which is computationally more expensive, relies on interpolating (with various algorithms, such as 

splines)  the  gridded  data  up  to  the  same  resolution  of  the  basin  perimeter  and  then  following  the 

above mentioned strategy, where now by definition no boundary cells are presents (cells are either 

inside  or  outside  the  basin).  Note  that  this  second  approach  aims  at  producing  a  detailed  (but 

somewhat arbitrary) representation of the 2D field, but does not ensure the a-priori consistency of 

the  integrated  flux.  We  have  tested  that  the  numerical  space  integrations  performed  by  adopting 

various  versions  of  the  two  above-mentioned  strategies  give  results  that  are  in  satisfactory 

agreement (within 1-2%), at least in the sense that these corrections are negligible with respect to

the later described inter-model discrepancies. The results presented in this paper have been obtained 

with the Voronoi tessellation approach.  

2.d From observed discharge back to runoff. 

Based on the methodology of Hagemann et al. (2004), we can perform an approximate, empirical 

reconstruction  of  monthly  quasi-observed  runoff  values  starting  from  observed  monthly  river 

discharge D.  Starting from the daily fields, we can define the monthly-averaged time series of the 

basin integrated P, E, B, and R fields as follows: 

 

j
≡Φ

where Φ is any of the field P, E, B, or R and, with obvious meaning of symbols, the time averaging 

on  the  right  hand  side  of  Equation  (6)  is  performed  over  the 

thj calendar  months  of  the 

thk of  30 

years. Therefore, 

kΦ  is a time series composed of 

30

×

 elements. For a certain catchment, 

Hagemann et al. (2004) assume that the relationship between basin integrated monthly mean runoff

(7) 

where L is an average lag between 

j

j

kR  and 

kD , and the periodic factors 

ja  take care of describing 

the area integrated transfer function from the basin to the Delta of the river. Hagemann et al. (2004) 

obtains the optimum values of L and 

ja  for each of the 12 calendar months from the 15 year time 

series (1979-1993) of simulated monthly total runoff and discharge values using a least square fit, 

allowing for integer lag values only. The input are obtained with the HIRHAM4 RCM (Hagemann 

and  Dümenil  Gates.,  2001),  forced  by  ERA-40  boundary  conditions,  feeding  runoff  data  into  a 

hydrological  discharge  model  (Hagemann  and  Dümenil,  1999),  so  that  the  fit  is  nothing  but  the 

approximate solution of an inverse problem. For the Danube catchment, the optimum lag is found to 

be L=1 (month), while the values of 

ja  are reported in Table 3. Thus, Equation (7) becomes

for month j (cyclic). Obviously, the output of this optimization procedure depends strongly on the 

hydrological discharge model adopted and (much more weakly) on the time duration and input data. 

Anyway, in the perfect hydrological model scenario (which is false, of course) and neglecting the 

other  effects,  Equation  (7)  allows  us  to  obtain  from  a  time-series  of  observed  discharges  the 

corresponding  hypothetical  (in  our  terms,  reconstructed)  basin  integrated  runoff  time-series.  We 

then  adopt  this  simplifying  working  hypothesis  and  generate  such  quasi-observed  monthly  time-

series for 1961-1990, taking care of making a minor adjustment: we divide the aj presented in Table 

3 by the same factor f=1.06, so that the 1961-1990 long term averages of 

j

kD  and 

kR  coincide, thus

respecting automatically Equation (5) for T=TMAX=30 years.    

 

 

3. Results: Yearly Hydrological balance  

The  considered  datasets  are  analyzed  in  terms  of  their  representation  of  the  hydrological  balance 

over the Danube basin by focusing on the long-term mean, on the interannual variability, and on the 

intra-annual variability (e.g., the seasonal cycle). 

For  each  model,  we  define,  by  suitably  averaging  over  the  calendar  years,  the  yearly  time 

series of the accumulated basin integrated fields as follows:

(8) is performed over the calendar year indicated as the lower index, and  y1  is the time-length of 1

year. Therefore, 

iΦ  is a time series composed of 30 elements. Using standard statistics, we have 

that the best estimate of the long-term mean of

Assessing the mutual consistency between the climatologies provided by the various models entails 

comparing their estimates of 

, and considering the statistical uncertainties associated 

)iΦμˆ
(

, 

)iΦσˆ
(

with such estimates. 

For all models and for all choices of the fields  Φ , the  time series 

iΦ  are compatible with 

the null hypotheses of white noise. In all cases, the values of the estimates of the lagged correlations 

are smaller than 0.35 for all time lags ≥ 1 year, whereas the corresponding 95% confidence interval 

for a synthetic white noise time series of the same length is about [-0.4, 0.4]. Similarly, the yearly 

time series do not show any statistically significant correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation 

index of the HadAM3 A2 driving model (Bojariu and Giorgi, 2005), nor with the various El Niño-

Southern  Oscillation  indexes  (see  http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/),  which,  being 

related to oceanic surface temperatures, are basically an input to the driving model. Therefore, for 

each model the confidence interval for the estimate of the climatological mean is centered on the 

quantity

 that are consistent within 20%. If the confidence intervals of 

)iΦμσˆ
)
(

(

two  models  do  not  overlap,  we  can  say  that  their  climatological  means  are  not  statistically 

consistent.  If  we  had  longer  runs,  we  could  restrict  progressively  the  confidence  interval  of  the 

climatological  mean.  Whereas  the  length  of  the  considered  simulations  allows  for  a  reliable 

statistical interpretation of the model discrepancies in the description of intra-seasonal variability, 

the same is not true for the interannual variability. However, by treating the variance of 

)iΦσˆ
(

 as a 

2χ -distributed random variable with 29 degrees of freedom  and by choosing a confidence level of 

95%,  we  obtain  in  all  cases  a  confidence  interval  spanning  around  30-40%  of  the  variance  itself. 

Therefore,  the  length  of  the  time  series  is  not  enough  for  a  detailed  statistical  assessment  of  the 

models’ discrepancies in the description of interannual variability.

The  graphical  result  displays  that  the  RCMs  are  clustered  into  three  quite  distinct  groups. 

The statistics of RACMO KNMI, of HIRHAM METNO, and of the two versions of SMHI agree 

with the statistics of HadAM3, the three versions of DMI, CHRM ETH, REMO and CLM GKSS 

greatly  underestimate,  by  factors  up  to  50%,  both 

,  and,  especially 

.  Finally,  two 

)iBσˆ
(

)iBμˆ
(

models (ICTP and PROMES UCM) overestimate these quantities up to 30%. When considering the 

95%  confidence    interval  of 

,  we  have  that  the  second  and  third  group  of  RCMs  are  not 

)iBμˆ
(

consistent with the driving model by many standard deviation, so that their climatologies of yearly 

water  balance  are  definitely  not  consistent.  Since  all  the  RCMs  are  driven  by  the  same  run  of 

HadAM3, such discrepancies seem rather peculiar. We also note that increases in the resolution do 

not significantly alter the performance of the DMI and SMHI models. 

If we consider Equation (5) and plug in T=TMAX and recall Equation (9), we have that the 

long-term  average  of  the  Danube  discharge  should  provide  a  verification  value  for 

)iBμˆ
(

  and  is

reported in Figure 2. From the GRDC dataset, we have that

the  water  balance  of  the  driving  model  is  in  a  remarkable  agreement  with  this  verification  value, 

with  the  95%  confidence  level  of   

  well  including  the  value  of

.  The  RCMs  whose 

MAXT

)iBμˆ

statistics is clustered around  HadAM3’s also agree well with the verification value, with the model 

HIRHAM METNO giving an almost exact value. Therefore, the statistics of the two other groups of 

RCMs have large wet or dry biases. 

When  considering  the  two  reanalyses,  we  have  that  neither  agrees  with  the  observational

data.  In  particular,  the  95%  confidence  level  of

)iBμˆ
(

, or for 

even one of the entries of 

iB  is clearly absurd, since it would imply that the Danube basin is a net 

exporter  of  water,  so  that  the  presence  of  a  river  would  be  impossible.  Most  sea  basins  are  net 

exporters of water , while river basins, by definition, have to be net importer of water (Peixoto and 

Oort, 1992). This suggests that the ERA40 datasets faces some serious problems in terms of water 

budget, at least in this area of the world. 

Further  information  on  the  representation  of  the  hydrological  cycle  can  be  obtained  by 

analyzing  the  disaggregated  fields  of  precipitation  and  of  evaporation.  Results  are  presented  in

Figure  3.  We  first  observe  that  the  width  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  of

much  larger,  by  almost  an  order  of  magnitude,  than  that  of 

,  thus  meaning  that  the 

precipitative fields have a much larger interannual variability, and their statistics is less constrained. 

We see a very large span of values, no clustering similar to the previous case is present. Anyway, 

we  see  qualitatively  a  positive  correlation  among  models  between 

)iPμˆ

  and 

)iEμˆ

models have high values of

values  of

(

, which tend to be compensated (in terms of net balance) by high 

,  while  other  models  have  consistently  a  weak  hydrological  cycle  both  in  the 

precipitation  and  evaporation  channel.  Note  that  the  two  models  with  highest  (and  virtually 

indistinguishable)  values  of 

,  the  PROMES  UCM  and  the  ICTP,  are  in  this  graph  in  total 

)iBμˆ
(

disagreement,  with  the  former  featuring  the  weakest  of  all  hydrological  cycles,  with  a  super-low 

total evaporation, and the latter featuring one of the strongest hydrological cycles, with a very high 

precipitation. Note also that some dry models, such as the DMI family or the REMO model, feature 

precipitation statistics which are in agreement with HadAM3, but have much stronger evaporation. 

The  RCMs  which  are  in  good  agreement  with  HadAM3  in  terms  of  net  balance  -  and  with  the 

observative  constraint,  here  represented  with  a  straight  line  parallel  to  the  bisectrix  –  are  actually 

quite  sparse  in  this  graph.  The  clustering  observed  in  Figure  2  is  here  represented  by  a  sort  of 

banded structure, parallel to the bisectrix, in the position of the model-representative dots. Note that, 

when  considering  different  version  of  the  same  model,  we  have,  in  both  the  cases  of  SMHI  and 

DMI models, that the increase in the resolution causes an enhanced precipitation (due to small scale 

features)  but  at  the  same  time  also  a  compensating  enhanced  evaporation,  so  that  the  net  water 

balance, which is determined by the large scale atmospheric water influx into the domain and on the 

efficiency  of  large  scale  precipitation,  does  not  depend  on  the  resolution,  as  can  be  observed  in 

Figure 2. The large span of the whole sets of RCMs and the effect of the resolution as depicted in 

the  precipitation-evaporation  plane  (Fig.  3)  –  as  opposed  to  the  clustering  when  water  balance  is 

considered  (Fig.  2)  -    may  be  interpreted  as  a  strong  model  sensitivity  to  small  scale  and  heavily 

parameterized features, such as soil and vegetation properties, localized (e.g. topography-induced) 

and  convective  rains  efficiency,  which  do  not  alter  the  global  balance  but  effect  in  a  relevant 

fashion  the  total  intensity  of  the  hydrological  cycle  and  are  relevant  in  the  separate  issue  of 

analyzing flood events. 

Looking  at  the  time-correlations  of  the 

iB , 

iP   and 

iE   time  series,  we  find  some  hints 

regarding the observed properties of the mean values. Let’s consider Table 4. Considering that the 

95% confidence level for the null hypothesis of absence of correlation is about 0.4, all the RCMs

have very a high degree of correlation with the driving model for the 

iB , in some cases reaching or 

exceeding 0.9. Such correlations may be related, in the first place, to the fact that the RCMs follow 

the variability of the driving model in fuelling the influx of water vapor into the area. At the same 

time,  from  Table  5,  we  observe  that  RCMs  and  HadAM3  feature  a  very  strong  internal 

precipitation-evaporation feedback, since the correlation of the 

iP  and 

iE  time series  is very high 

and  positive,  except  for  one  model  (PROMES  UCM),  where,  unexpectedly,  such  a  correlation  is 

statistically not significant. This shows that a positive mechanism is set up when local processes are 

considered: higher precipitation brings to wetter soil and so to higher evaporation, which increases 

the water content of the atmosphere. This feedback does not preclude the stabilization of  the net 

hydrological  balance,  since  the  precipitation  and  evaporation  anomalies  tend  to  cancel  out.  Note 

that,  when  considering  the  reanalyses,  while  the  NCEP/NCAR  datasets  is  consistent  with  that 

picture, ERA40 shows a negative correlation (at the edge of 95% statistical significance) between 

the 

iP  and 

iE  time series, thus reinforcing the idea that in this latter reanalysis some serious issues 

are  present  in  modeling  water  processes.  Nevertheless,  as  seen  in  Figure  3,  the  precipitation 

variability is much larger and dominates in all RCMs and in HadAM3, when balance is considered 

(this  applies  also  for  the  PROMES  UCM  model).  Thanks  to  the  interplay  of  the  driving  model’s 

constraint and of the internal mechanism, as we can observe from Table 4, also the RCMs 

iP  and 

iE  time series are very strongly correlated with those of 

iP  of the HadAM3, except for the case of 

the evaporative data of PROMES UCM, in agreement with what observed above.   

Therefore,  we  may  deduce  that,  while  the  RCMs  actually  act  as  strongly  constrained 

downscaling models, at the same time, once outputs are upscaled via spatial integration procedure 

on a finite - not too large, not too small domain, as discussed earlier -  domain, information may be, 

and actually in most cases is, degraded. 

3.b Runoff 

Further information on the performance of the models can be obtained using a diagnostic procedure 

relying  on  Equation  (5),  which  states  the  equivalence,  when  long  time-averages  are  considered, 

between the water balance obtained by integrating the difference between the precipitation and the 

evaporation  fields  and  that  obtained  by  integrating  the  runoff,  which  results  as  output  of  the 

(severely parameterized) water dynamics within soils. Unfortunately, runoff data for the HadAM3 

model have not been available. In Figure 4 we present the scatter plot where the abscissa of each

4. Results: Seasonal Cycle of the Hydrological balance  

 
As a dual analysis to what presented in the previous section, we show some results regarding the 

intra-annual variability of the variables relevant for the hydrological balance of the Danube basin. 

In particular, we analyze the seasonal cycle: for a discussion on various definitions of the seasonal 

cycle, see e.g.  Lucarini et al., (2004). We hereby identify the seasonal cycle with the usual long-

term monthly averages of the records, so that, following the definitions contained in Equation (5), 

the seasonal cycle of the basin-integrated monthly accumulated field  Φ  is given by:

The  seasonal  cycle  of  basin-integrated  precipitation  is  presented  in  Figure  5a.  We  first 

observe that all RCMs, the HadAM3 model, and the ERA40 reanalyses qualitatively agree on the 

overall features, even if for all months the span is well over 50% of the ensemble mean of RCMs 

(not in figure). The quantitative agreement for the climatology of the early summer precipitations is 

especially  problematic,  probably  due  to  the  delicate  model-dependent  tuning  of  the  convective 

processes. With this respect, it is notable that the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis gives very high values 

for the May-to-August precipitations, which are month-wise larger by a factor of about 2 than the 

second largest entry. The plot contained in Figure 5b describes the occurrences of RCMs having the 

absolute  maximum  (blue)  or  minimum  (red)  of  the  seasonal  cycle  in  the  corresponding  month. 

Precipitations  peak  in  the  early  summer  months  and  in  November,  which  gives  more  often  a 

secondary maximum. This is a typical feature of the observed climatology of the precipitation of the 

Danubian region, as shown by Brunetti et al. (2006), albeit on a more limited domain. The minima 

of  precipitation  are  also  clustered  in  two  periods  of  the  year,  namely  February  and  the  summer 

months. The latter is a signature of the influence of the typical Mediterranean summer. 

 

The seasonal cycle of evaporation is presented for all datasets in Figure 6a. Again, we have 

that all models qualitatively agree, even if the span of the values is over 50% of the ensemble mean 

of  RCMs  (not  in  figure)  for  all  months.  Figure  6b  shows  a  characteristic  insolation-dependent 

pattern, where the maxima of evaporation are reached in all cases around the summer solstice and 

the  minima  are  realized  around  the  winter  solstice.  It  is  notable  that  the  PROMES  UCM  model, 

which  has  been  shown  in  the  previous  section  to  be  problematic  in  the  representation  of  the 

precipitation-evaporation feedback, features the smallest and somewhat delayed seasonal cycle for 

evaporation.  Compared  to  the  other  datasets,  the  NCEP/NCAR  reanalyses,  instead,  features  the 

strongest evaporation in virtually all months. 

Combining the information on precipitation and evaporation, we obtain the seasonal cycle of 

the water balance, which is depicted in Figure 7a. The agreement between the RCMs is better for 

this diagnostics, as could be guessed by the results of the previous section, since the biases in the 

precipitation  and  evaporation  fields  tend  to  even  out.  It  is  remarkable  that  –  see  Figure  7b  -  all 

RCMs have the largest positive water balance in November and the largest negative balance in July, 

which again shows that the water balance is structurally a more robust variable. Figure 7a clearly 

shows  a  major  problem  for  the  NCEP/NCAR  reanalyses,  which  is  in  total  disagreement  with  the 

other  datasets.  The  water  balance  is  positive  and  peaks  in  the  summer  season,  due  to  the  large 

 

17

overestimation of the precipitation shown in Figure 5a, whereas it is minimum (and negative) in the 

spring and in the fall, where all the other datasets have positive water balances. 

Finally,  we  examine  the  seasonal  cycle  of  the  runoff.  The  runoff  is  the  output  of  the 

redistribution  of  water  within  soil  due  to  the  water  balance  B,  so  that,  as  mentioned  before,  the 

runoff results to be a smoother function of time, with peaks and dips delayed with respect to those 

of B. In Figure 8a we show the monthly long-term accumulated runoff for all RCMs and reanalyses. 

Moreover, the seasonal cycle of the reconstructed actual runoff of Danube, computed following the 

strategy depicted in subsection 2d, and of the actual Danube discharge are depicted. All RCMs are 

in broad qualitative agreement with the reconstructed runoff, and feature a spring maximum and a 

late summer minimum. Note that, in all cases, the delay between the minimum of the water balance 

and the corresponding minimum of the runoff (~ 2 months) is shorter that the delay between the two 

maxima (~ 5 months). Such a nonlinear effect is due to the accumulation of water in the solid phase 

as seasonal snow cover during the winter months and to its subsequent rapid thawing in spring. The 

disagreement between RCMs is largest in this period of the year, suggesting that the representation 

of  the  snowpack  is  somewhat  delicate.  In  Figure  8b,  we  synthesize  the  information  contained  in 

Figure 8a by depicting the absolute and relative (with respect to the mean value) amplitude of the 

seasonal  cycle  for  all  RCMs.  The  RCMs  do  not  feature  a  high  degree  of  quantitative  agreement, 

spanning a relatively wide range of values for both measures of the amplitude of the seasonal cycle, 

and  the  clustering  observed  regarding  the  long-term  annual  statistics  in  Figs.  2,  3,  and  4  is  not 

reproduced here. When focusing on the verification side of the auditing processes, we observe that 

the two versions SMHI25 and SMHI50 are in remarkable agreement with the reconstructed runoff, 

whereas most RCMs simulate seasonal cycles with smaller amplitudes, both in relative and absolute 

terms.  In  Figs.  8a  and  8b  we  also  depict  the  information  relative  to  the  seasonal  cycle  of  the 

observed discharge of the Danube river. As foreseen in subsection 2d, the actual discharge of a river 

results  from  an  effective  low-pass  filtering  of  the integrated  runoff,  so  that  its  seasonal  cycle  is  a 

rather a slow-varying function - the amplitude of the seasonal cycle is more than halved - , where 

the  peak  and  the  dip  are  delayed,  occurring  in  late  spring  and  early  fall,  respectively.  As  already 

noted  when  commenting  Figure  4,  the  two  reanalyses  do  not  provide  any  useful  information 

regarding the statistical properties of the runoff in the Danube basin: in particular we may note that 

the  NCEP/NCAR  dataset  provides  a  seasonal  cycle  having  a  heavily  exaggerated  amplitude, 

featuring  also  an  unphysical  summer  relative  maximum  due  to  the  summer  maximum  of  water 

balance shown in Figure 7a.

5. Summary and Conclusions 

 

In  this  paper  we  have  intercompared  and  verified  several  RCMs  in  their  representation  of  the 

statistical  properties  of  the  hydrological  balance  over  the  Danube  river  basin  for  the  time  frame 

1961-1990.  All  of  the  analyzed  RCMs  have  participated  to  the  EU  project  PRUDENCE 

(http://dmi.prudence.dk)  and  are  forced  at  the  boundaries  by  the  same  run  of  the  same  driving 

AGCM  –  HadAM3  (scenario  A2).  For  matters  of  completeness,  we  have  also  considered  the 

outputs  of  HadAM3,  and  of  the  ECMWF  and  NCEP/NCAR  reanalyses.  The  Danube  has  been 

chosen  as  a  case  study  because  of  its  multiple  relevance  at  socio-economical  as  well  as 

environmental  and  climatic  level.  While  being  well  within  continental  Europe,  the  Danube  basin 

has a direct relevance to the Mediterranean region, since it provides a relevant input of freshwater to 

the  sea  as  well  as  being  fuelled  mostly  by  precipitations  due  to  water  of  Mediterranean  origin. 
Moreover, the basin is large enough (about 800.000 Km2) to be well-resolved by RCMs and small 

enough  with  respect  to  their  typical  domains  not  to  have  statistical  properties  that  are  a-priori 

constrained by the driving AGCM. It might be argued that the Danube basin is geographically close 

to  the  eastern  boundary  of  the  domain  of  some  of  the  considered  RCMs.  Since  the  hydrological 

cycle,  as  widely  discussed  in  this  paper,  is  essentially  meteorological,  and  not  geographical  in 

nature,  actually  this  is  not  a  critical  issue,  since,  speaking  in  meteorological  terms,  the  weather 

comes  from  west.  The  hydrological  balance  has  been  computed  in  two  different,  but  in  principle 

equivalent ways. The first approach, which has a more meteorological nuance, relies on integrating 

over  the  area  of  interest  the  precipitation  and  evaporation  fields  and  taking  the  difference.  The 

second approach, which is more typically hydrological, relies on integrating the total runoff field. 

The  equivalence  dependn  on  the  conservation  of  water  within  the  climate  subdomains.  The 

verification  data,  given  the  impossibility  of  having  reliable  space-integrated  estimates  of 

precipitation  and  evaporation  or  runoff  fields,  due  to  their  complex  statistical  nature,  have  been 

chosen  as  the1961-1990  monthly  discharge  time  series  at  the  Danube  Delta,  as  provided  by  the 

GRDC. 

When considering annual averages of the hydrological balance computed starting from the 

precipitation and evaporation fields, even if they are driven by the same run of the same AGCM, the 

RCMs are largely not self-consistent with each other, with a relative span larger than 50% of their 

esnsemble  mean.  Qualitatively,  RCMs  are  clustered  in  three  groups  featuring,  respectively,  a 

hydrological  balance  much  smaller  than,  statistically  consistent  with,  and  much  larger  than  what 

simulated by the driving AGCM. The discrepancies on the mean value of the hydrological balance, 

which  depends  on  the  large-scale  climatological  net  influx  of  water  vapor  into  the  basin,  implies

that, within their domains, the RCMs differ in the representation of relevant synoptic features such 

as  storm  tracks.  -  slight  latitudinal  variations  in  the  preferred  path  of  the  water  vapour  rich-

perturbations – and/or in the efficiency of the large scale precipitation. Nevertheless, the time series 

of  the  annual  balances  of  the  RCMs  feature  a  positive  correlation  (close  to  1)  with  that  of  the 

AGCM, thus showing that a large scale control at least on the variability is present.  

The analysis of the basin-integrated, yearly accumulated precipitation and evaporation fields 

allows us to detect the presence of a precipitation-evaporation positive feedback process. For each 

RCM,  the  two  time  series  have  a  very  high  (close  to  1)  positive  correlation  (except  for  the 

PROMES  UCM  model),  and  at  the  same  time  the RCMs with high values of yearly accumulated 

precipitation feature in most cases strong evaporation. In particular, in the SMHI and DMI models, 

increases  in  the  resolution  do  not  alter  the  net  water  balance,  while  speeding  up  the  hydrological 

cycle by enhancing precipitation and evaporation. 

The  analysis  of  the  yearly  accumulated  runoff  allows  for  assessing  inconsistencies  within 

each RCM in the treatment of water within soil. All RCMs provide data which are consistent with 

the hypothesis that they conserve water when soil modeling is concerned, whereas one model (CLM 

GKSS) seems to create water within the soil, since the basin integrated long-term average of runoff 

is larger than that of water balance in a statistically significant way.  

Large discrepancies among RCMs exist when the climatologies of the monthly accumulated 

fields are considered. For precipitation, the statistics of the model for the annual maxima is bimodal 

for  both  maxima  and  minima:  most  models  have  weakest  precipitation  in  winter  and  strongest 

precipitation  in  early  summer,  whereas  for  some  models  the  annual  extremes  are  realized  in  late 

summer (dry) and fall (wet), respectively. Due to the dominant role played by the solar insolation, 

all  RCMs  agree  on  setting  the  maxima  and  minima  of  total  evaporation  nearby  the  summer  and 

winter  solstices,  respectively.  Nevertheless,  also  in  this  case,  the  quantitative  span  of  models 

outputs  is  very  large,  ranging  over  50%.  When  considering  the  annual  balance,  we  have  a  good 

agreement among all RCMs, which all have a minimum of the balance in July and a maximum in 

November.  The  compensation  between  the  anomalies  in  precipitation  and  evaporation  due  to  the 

feedback as well as the large scale control due to the driving model may explain such an agreement. 

In the case of the seasonal cycle of runoff, we have a surrogate of a verification data, since 

from  the  actual  Danube  discharge  obtained  from  GRDC  it  has  been  possible  to  approximately 

regress  statistically  -  following  Hagemann  et  al.  (2004)  -    the  monthly  basin-integrated  runoff. 

Essentially all RCMs feature the same timing for maxima  (late spring) and minima (fall), which is 

in  broad  agreement  with  the  quasi  observations,  whereas  quantitative  disagreements  exist, 

especially in the spring period, probably because of the problematic representation of the process of

seasonal snowpack melting. When looking at the amplitude of the seasonal cycle, we observe that 

only  two  versions  of  the  same  model  (SMHI25  and  SMHI50)  agree  with  quasi-observations, 

whereas most models tend to have a too flat seasonal cycle. 

Finally,  we  find  that  the  NCEP-NCAR  and  ERA-40  reanalyses  are  largely  inadequate  for 

representing the hydrology of the Danube river basin, both for the reconstruction of the long-term 

averages  and  of  the  seasonal  cycle,  and  cannot  in  any  sense  be  used  as  verification.  The  ERA40 

long-term  water  balance  reanalysis  is  one  order  of  magnitude  smaller  than  observations,  with 

several  years  featuring  an  unphysical  negative  balance  -  the  Danube  basin  resulting  to  be  an 

exporter  of  water  -  ,  and  a  huge  amount  of  water  is  created  in  the  soil  model  module.  The 

NCEP/NCAR reanalysis is much better in the representation of the long-term average of the water 

balance,  and  its  soil  model  is  a  little  more  consistent  for  water  conservation  (but  far  from  being 

perfect).  Nevertheless,  when  looking  into  monthly  climatologies,  the  NCEP/NCAR  dataset 

performances are much worse: the summer precipitations are greatly exaggerated, and, in spite of 

the  evaporative  feedback,  the  water  balance  is  positive  and  maximizes  in  summer  time,  which  is 

quite  unreasonable.  The  runoff  water  cycle  in  also  completely  off-the-track  with  respect  to  the 

RCMs and the quasi-observations. 

Since the considered approaches relies on the mass conservation principle and bypasses the 

details  of  the  air-land  interface  modeling,  we  propose  that  the  atmospheric  components  of  RCMs 

still face difficulties in representing the current water balance even on a relatively large scale, such 

as  that  of  the  Danube  basin.  We  may  infer  that  RCMs  performances  might  be  even  more 

problematic in the representation of the hydrological balance on smaller river basins.  

 Criticalities  in  the  parameterization  of  the  microphysics  of  non-convective  precipitation 

and,  in  the  representation  within  the  limited  domains  of  synoptic  scale  atmospheric  circulation 

patterns,  which  may  also  be  influenced  by  the  details  of  the  boundary  conditions,  are  good 

candidates for these issues. Note that the DMI and METNO-HIRHAM models, which give rather 

different results for all the analyzed statistical properties, are actually the same model at dynamical 

level,  but  differ  in  the  choice  of  the  limited  domain  and  in  the  parameterization  of  microphysical 

processes.  

Since for some RCMs the hydrological balance estimates obtained with the runoff fields do 

not  precisely  agree  with  those  obtained  via  precipitation  minus  evaporation,  some  deficiencies  of 

the land model in the conservation of water are also apparent.  

As a conclusion, we may note that since the driving AGCM is in excellent agreement with 

the verification data, some RCMs seem to degrade the information provided by the large scale flow, 

once the local, downscaled information they produce is upscaled to an intermediate range between 

 

21

the minimum resolvable scale and the domain size. This emphasizes the fact that the downscaling 

and upscaling procedures do not commute and are both problematic. We suggest that these results 

should  be  carefully  considered  in  the  perspective  of  auditing  RCMs  and  assessing  their  ability  to 

simulate future climate changes, which might be problematic even if the driving is performed by an 

excellent GCM. 

 

Future  studies  will  include  a  similar  analysis  performed  on  GCMs  run  under  various 

scenarios, in particular those considered by PCMDI (http://www.pcmdi-llnl.gov)

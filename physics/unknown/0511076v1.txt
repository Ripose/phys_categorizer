This paper defines the spacetime geometry attached with observor as vacuum geometry (it defines 

the  idea  physical  measurement  geometry)  and  the  spacetime  geometry  attached  with  matter  as 

spacetime  geometry.  The  initial  spacetime  geometry  attached  with  matter  is  taken  as  refference 

geometry  (named  as  initial  co-moving  coordinator  system),  and  the  current  spacetime  geometry 

attached  with  matter  (named  as  current  co-moving  coordinator  system)  is  determined  by  the 

four-dimensional  displacement  field  measured  in  initial  spacetime  geometry.  Matter  motion  is 

expressed  by  the  motion  transformation  of  basic  vectors  of  four-dimensional  co-moving 

coordinator  system.  The  transformation  of  motion  expressed  by  displacement  describes  the 

transient geometry form of matter motion. In general relativity theory and in gauge field theory, the 

geometrical  invariant  of  “word-line  distance”  is  used  to  define  the  geometry  of  space-time 

continuum. However, based on this research, this is only true when the time-shift is in special form. 

For more complicated matter motion, the gauge field theory and general relativity will be failed. 

The  paper  shows  that  traditional  physical  conservation  laws  and  the  geometrical  invariant 

introduced  by  the  gauge  field  theory  and  general  relativity  are  included  in  the  finite  geometrical 

field theory as simple special cases. 

Key Words: general relativity, motion transformation, geometrical field 

 

 

 

 
1. Introduction 
Hermann  Weyl[1]  reformulated  Einstein’s  theory  on  the  basis  of  a  “pure  infinitesimal  geometry”  into  a 
geometrical  field.  In  his  theory,  direct  comparisons  of  length  or  duration  could  be  made  at  neighboring 
points of spacetime, but not, as the Riemannian geometry of Einstein’s theory permitted, “at a distance”. 
For the continuum of spacetime, Arthur Stanley Eddington further generalized [2] Weyl’s four-dimensional 
geometry,  wherein  the  sole  primitive  geometrical  notion  is  the  non-metrical  comparison  of  direction  or 
orientation at the same or neighboring points. 
In Weyl’s geometry the magnitude of vectors at the same point, but pointing in different directions, might 
be directly compared to one another; in Eddington’s, comparison was immediate only for vectors pointing 
in  the  same  direction.  His  “theory  of  the  affine  field”  included  both  Weyl’s  geometry  and  the 
semi-Riemannian geometry of Einstein’s general relativity as special cases. 
Eddington  was  persuaded  that  Weyl’s  “principle  of  relativity  of  length”  was  “an  essential  part  of  the 
relativistic conception”. When existing physics, in particular, Einstein’s theory of gravitation, is set in the 
context  of  Eddington’s  world  geometry[3],  it  yields  a  surprising  consequence:  The  Einstein  law  of 

gravitation appears as a definition! In the form 

0=µνR

  it defines what in the “world geometry” appears 

to the mind as “vacuum” while in the form of the Einstein field equation noted above, it defines what is 
there encountered by the mind as “matter”. 
Based on Chen Zhida’s research about the geometry of matter motion in three-dimensional space, the local 
geometry  of  matter  is  determined  by  matter  motion  itself  rather  than  mathematic  transformation [4-5].  So, 

1

Weyl  and  Eddinton’s  matter  geometry  is  damaged  by  confusing  the  phisical  motion  with  mathematic 
transformation. 
The  paper  accepts  Weyl’s  “principle  of  relativity  of  length”  as  “an  essential  part  of  the  relativistic 
conception” and Chen’s idear that the locally scale (gauge) is defined by the displacement field of matter 
motion. 
This paper reformulats the physics on the basis of displacement field of matter motion in four-dimensional 
geometry.  The  continuum  of  spacetime  is  composed  by  the  “world geometry”  defined  by  “vacuum”  and 
the metter in consideration. Hence, the “matter” geometry is determined by matter motion itself rather than 
the  “world  geometry”.  To  this  purpose  a  general  method  of  deductive  presentation  of  field  physics  is 
developed mathematically by the displacement field of matter motion in the continuum of spacetime. 
 
2. Spacetime Feature of Matter and Motion Transformation 
The space feature of matter is that any physical matter has a definite configuration or taking up a definite 
space range, which can be described by three-dimensional geometry. The duration feature of matter motion 
is  described  by  time  in  traditional  physics,  which  is  flowing  with  constant  speed.  The  establishment  of 
retativity theory shows that the time duration (in timespace attached with “observor”) depends on matter 
motion. Hence, the “world time” invariant is introduced to define the Riemannian geometry of Einstein's 
theory. 
The  logic  problem  in  the  difinition  of  “world  time”  invariant  is  that  it  is  defined  as  attached  with 
“observor”  (as  a  physical condition),  while the Riemannian geometry  is  defined  as  attached  with  matter. 
Hence the time gauge in the Riemannian geometry attached with matter is variable. If the moving matter is 
rigid,  that  is  the  space  gauges  in  the  Riemannian  geometry  attached  with  matter  is  invariable,  then  the 
requiment of “world time” invariant only can be achieved by the variable time gauge attached with matter. 
On  the  other hand,  if  the matter  is  highly  deformable,  then the  requiment  of  “world  time”  invariant  will 
require  that  the  time  gauge  attached  with  matter  is  variable.  So,  the  difinition  of  “world  time”  invariant 
cannot be used as the intrinsic feature of the Riemannian geometry attached with matter. 
It is accepted widely that the “world time” invariant is surportted by Michelson-Morley’s experiement. But, 
the only conclusion one can make from the experiememnt is that the time duration defined as attached with 
“matter”  is  invariant.  Therefor  the  the  Riemannian  geometry  attached  with  matter  cannot  be  defined  by 
introducing the “world time” invariant. 
This  problem  can  be  overcomed  by  introducing  “world  time”  as  time  coordinator  parameter  in  the 
Riemannian  geometry  attached  with  matter  (be  defined  as  four-dimensional  co-moving  coordinator 
system). By this way, a matter point is identified geometrically by its intrinsic four-dimensional position. 
Its  motion  will  determine  its  actual  gauge  field  which  is  measured  by  “oberservor”  in  conventional 
geometry.  Hence,  the  matter  motion  will  be  expressed  by  the  variation  of  actual  gauge  field.  As  the 
variation  of  gauge  field  can  be  expressed  by  the  transformation  of  basic  vectors  of  four-dimensional 
co-moving coordinator system, the motion transformation is defined to describe the matter motion. 
The  Riemannian  geometry  attached  with  matter  in  three-dimensional  co-moving  coordinator  system  has 
been  established  by  Chen  Zhida  [4-5].  His  research  shows  that  the  Riemannian  geometry  attached  with 
matter is determined by the displacement field of matter, which is measured by “observor” in conventional 
geometry. 
This  paper  defines  the  spacetime  geometry  attached  with  “observor”  as  “vacuum”  geometry  and  the 
spacetime  geometry  attached  with  matter  as  the  Riemannian  geometry.  The  initial  spacetime  geometry 
attached with matter is taken as refference geometry (named as initial co-moving coordinator system), and 

 

2

the current spacetime geometry attached with matter (named as current co-moving coordinator system) is 
determined by the four-dimensional displacement field measured in initial spacetime geometry. 
In  the  initial  co-moving  coordinator  system,  matter  is  identified  by  four-dimensional  co-moving 
coordinators.  For  the  matter,  the  four-dimensional  co-moving  coordinators  are  invariant  while  the  actual 
gauge  field  is  varying  with  matter  motion  (hence  the  four-dimensional  co-moving  coordinator  system  is 
varying with matter motion). 
The  initial  four-dimensional  co-moving  coordinator  system  is  defined  by  anti-covariant  coordinators

4x   is  taken  as  time  coordinator. 

From  physical  consideration,  the  initial  co-moving  coordinator  system  can  be  defined  as  the  standard 
three-dimensional space adding time-dimension, in which following conditions are met:

where,  c   is light speed in “vacuum”. The difference with the Riemannian geometry of Einstein’s theory 
is that time gauge in here is real rather than imaginary. 
By such a sellection, matter is defined in standard physical measuring system at initial time of motion. 

In  physics,  matter  motion  can  expressed  by  displacement  field 

iu   measured  in  standard  physical 

measuring  system.  By  above  sellection,  the  displacement  field 

iu   is  also  defined  in  the  initial 

four-dimensional co-moving coordinator system. 
For any measuring time, the matter in discussing has invariant coordinators, but its local basic vectors are 

changed into (

there are relationship between initial basic vectors and current basic vectors:

where,

iδ   is unit tensor. 

It  is  clear  that  the  incremental  motion  of  matter  is  viewed  as  “deformation”  of  matter’s  geometry.  So, 
gravitation  field  is  viewed  as  matter  “deformation”  respect  with  idear  vacuum  matter.  According  to 
Einstein's  idear  [6-7],  the  Newton’s  inertial  coordinator  system  can  be  replaced  by  the  gradient  field  of 
infinitisimal  displacement.  The  equations  (2)  and  (3)  show  that  the  displacement  gradient  determins  the 

current local geometry. Hence, the transformation tensor 

i

jF   can be named as motion transformation.

For observer, the standard physical measuring system is established in vaccum. If the vaccum is taken as a 
special matter which depends on cosmic feature matter moving in, the vaccum can be viewed as refference 
matter for matter motion. By this understanding, for matter moving in another refference matter field, the 
initial four-dimensional co-moving coordinator system can be defined by the geometry of refference matter 
field. In fact, for incremental motion, the refference matter field is the matter itself in initial state. 
As the local time gauge in initial matter is: 

The physical time incrementals for matter motion in initial and curent co-moving coordinator systems are, 
respectively:

It  can  be  seen  that  the  time  incremental  of  moving  matter  is  longer  than  the  time  incremental  of  static 
matter. Noted that our geometry is defined in commoving-coordinator system, for such a selection,  dt is

result of special relativity. 
For  high  speed  moving,  unlike  the  special  relativity,  the  physical  time  shorting  will  cause  negative  time 
displacement gradient. There are two special cases.   
(a). For very high speed motion, if: 

It shows that for very high speed moving the physical time ratio will become bigger than one rather than 
less  than  one  for  the  low  speed  moving.  This  overcomes  the  twin-brother’s  porodox  in  the  Riemannian 
geometry of Einstein’s theory. 
(b). There exists such a matter motion, the matter moving speed is very low or zero, but there is significant 
time displacement gradient that:

It may be less or bigger than one, depending on the sign of time displacement gradient. 
As  the  time  shorting  and  time  expanding  are  both  well  observed  in  cosmic  oberservation  [8] ,  and  the 
general  relativity  has  confirmed  that  the  oberserved  physical  time  is  a  relative  one  and  is  variable,  it  is 
meaningful to introduce such a motion matter.   
 
3. Geometrical Invariants and Conservation Laws in Physics 
For a matter, if it is defined initially in vacuum geometry as having geometric invariant:

From  physical  consideration,  no  matter  what  initial  geometry  system  is  used  as  initial  co-moving 

coordinator  system  geometry,  the  subjectivity  of  physical  motion  will  require  the 

2Σd

  be  geometrical 

invariant.   
 
4. Matter Motion   
Matter motion can be divided into three simple typical cases, as described bellow. 
4.1 Non-Quantum Matter Motion 
Based  on  the  previous  research,  for  non-quantum  matter  motion  the  time  displacement  field  component 
can be replaced by Newton’s Acceleration Law. It is equivalent to suppose there is no time displacement. 
Hence, we suppose for non-quantum matter motion: 

Hence, the geometrical invariant of non-quantum matter motion is:

This  defines  the  conventional  three-dimensional  physical  measure  space.  It  defines  the  spatial  motion 

distance as geometrical invariant. For Newton’s matter point, it leads to the moving moment conservation. 
4.2 Quantum Matter Motion 
Based on the previous research, for quantum matter motion the time displacement field component play the 
main  roles.  It  is  equivalent  to  suppose  there  is  a  significant  time  displacement.  Hence,  we  suppose  for 
quantum matter motion:

So, we can define time displacement is a scalar function in four-dimensional time-space. As a special case, 
this geometrical invariant can be explained as matter-energy conservation. 
4.3 Very High Speed Matter Motion 
For very high speed matter motion, the time gradient of time displacement can be ignored, that is to say:

In general relativity theory and in gauge field theory, this equation form is used to define the geometry of 

space-time  continuum  under  the  meaning  that  the 

  is  the  geometrical  invariant  of  “word-line 

2Σd

distance”. However, based on this paper’s research, this is only true when the time displacement is normal 
and in form (30) or (31). For more complicated matter motion, the gauge field theory and general relativity 
will be failed. 
Summing up above discussion, we can see that traditional physical conservation laws and the geometrical 
invariant introduced by the gauge field theory and general relativity are included in the finite geometrical 
field theory as simple special cases. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The research shows an unified field theory of physics can be established with the idea introducing motion 
transformation,  which  is  completely  determined  by  the  displacement  gradient  in  four-dimensional 
space-time continuum. The vacuum is taken as a special matter with one intrinsic physical parameter-light 
speed  c . For a matter, it can be identified with co-moving coordinators with local varying geometry. The 
local  varying  geometry  represents  the  motion  of  matter  in  consideration.  The  paper  introduces  the 
geometrical  invariants  to  express  physical  conservation  laws.  The  results  show  that  the  geometrical 
invariant introduced by the gauge field theory and general relativity are included in the finite geometrical 
field theory as simple special cases. 
So, an unified physics of matter motion can be expressed by the finite geometrical field theory given by 
this paper.

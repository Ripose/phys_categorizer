Abstract— We present here the ﬁrst direct and detailed mea-
surements of the spatial distribution of the ionizing radiation
surrounding a hadron collider experiment. Using data from two
different exposures we measure the effect of additional shielding
on the radiation ﬁeld around the Collider Detector at Fermilab
(CDF). Employing a simple model we parameterize the ionizing
radiation ﬁeld surrounding the detector.

Index Terms— Radiation measurement, ionizing radiation, ra-

diation ﬁeld, radiation damage.

I. INTRODUCTION

I N modern collider experiments, the supporting infrastructure

lies external to the detector, but inside the radiation environ-
ment surrounding the detector. The apparatus and its infrastruc-
ture may be sensitive to both chronic and acute radiation doses.
These doses induce additional detector occupancy, single-event
effects in the supporting electronics, or even irreversible fail-
ure. This sensitivity can lead to additional contamination of
physics signals, corruption of the data, reduced reliability of
the detector, or reduced detector lifetime [1]. Knowledge of
the spatial distribution, dose rate and sources of radiation are,
therefore, critical components in the design and operation of an
experiment at a hadron collider. Most experiment designs have
relied on a combination of radiation damage measurements and
computer simulations of the radiation environment [2], [3], [4].
However, no substantial measurements of the radiation ﬁeld
surrounding a collider detector exist in the literature.

In this article, we present the ﬁrst detailed measurement of
the radiation ﬁeld surrounding the Collider Detector at Fermilab

use two types of thermal luminescent dosimeters to measure
both the ionizing radiation and the radiation from low energy

we evaluate the effectiveness of additional shielding installed
between the exposures.

II. RADIATION FIELD MEASUREMENT

A. The Collider Detector at Fermilab

CDF records particles produced in proton-antiproton col-
lisions by means of various detectors surrounding the beam
line in a cylindrical geometry. The Tevatron collider provides
protons ((cid:7) ) and antiprotons ( (cid:8)
(cid:7) ) which can collide every (cid:9) 396 ns

material in a meta-stable state, (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:1) , with a long lifetime (left). Heating the
material leads to emission of visible photons (right).

direction and collide with oncoming antiprotons at the center of
the CDF detector at (cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:13)
(see Fig. 1). In the CDF cylindrical
geometry we denote the distance from the beam line by (cid:15) , and
the azimuthal angle around the (cid:9) -axis by (cid:16)

A series of semiconductor and gaseous detectors, immersed
in a (cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:4)
(cid:18) T solenoidal magnetic ﬁeld within (cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:20)(cid:19) m of the beam
line, measure charged particles produced at (cid:7)
(cid:7) collisions. Out-
side the tracking volume, calorimeters measure the total energy
of neutral and charged particles from the proton-antiproton
collisions. The calorimeters are surrounded by muon detectors.
(cid:7) collisions at the center of CDF is recorded
by the Cherenkov Luminosity Counter (CLC) [5]. On either
side of the detector, scintillator counters surrounding the beam
pipe record losses from protons and antiprotons ejected from
the beam. Proton (antiproton) losses are deﬁned as the coin-
cidence of a counter signal with a proton (antiproton) bunch
crossing the plane of the scintillator on its way into the CDF
detector.

B. Thermal Luminescent Dosimeters

Two types of Harshaw TLD chips are used for the radiation
measurements. One type (TLD-700) is based on (cid:21) LiF and
is sensitive to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation passing
through the dosimeter brings the material
in a meta-stable
state with very long lifetime. Heating the TLD chip leads to
a transition back to ground state accompanied by the emission
of a photon (see Fig. 2). The number of photons produced
is proportional to the population in these meta-stable states,
which is in turn proportional to the amount of ionizing radiation
that has traversed the TLD chip. The other dosimeter type
(TLD-600) is based on (cid:22) LiF and is sensitive to both ionizing
radiation and low-energy neutrons ( (cid:23)(cid:25)(cid:24)(cid:27)(cid:26)(cid:29)(cid:28)(cid:30)(cid:13)(cid:5)(cid:13)
keV). The
reaction (cid:31)(cid:12)(cid:8) (cid:22) Li !#" H (cid:8)%$
results in a transition to the meta-
stable state discussed above, by means of the recoiling tritium
( " H) and helium ( $ ) nuclei.

Dosimeters are grouped in two triplets, one of each TLD
type, and put in &’(cid:4)((cid:3)*) cm +,(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:4)(cid:20)(cid:19)(cid:30)(cid:6) cm holders made of (cid:13)-(cid:4)(cid:20).(cid:30)(cid:6) mm
thick FR-4 (see Fig. 3). The TLD’s are held in place by
./(cid:7)10 m thick kapton tape, and are subsequently placed in 160
locations around the collision hall to accumulate radiation, on
both the proton ( (cid:9)2(cid:26)3(cid:13) ) and the antiproton ( (cid:9)243(cid:13) ) sides

C. Calibration and Dosimetry

We calibrate the TLD response to ionizing radiation with a
rad photon exposure from a _\"U(cid:21) Cs source [6]. A calibration
factor (in rad/nC) for each TLD chip is then determined by
heating up the chip and measuring the light yield using a
Harshaw model 2000 TLD reader [7]. A reproducibility of ‘ 1 a
and a chip-to-chip variation of ‘ 3 a
of the TLD-600 chips to neutrons is calibrated with a (cid:3)
exposure to a bdcUb Cf source. We obtain a ‘ 10 a

LiF TLD’s are known to exhibit non-linearity for doses above
rad. In order to account for this behavior, we expose a
small sample of TLD’s to doses up to (cid:3)6(cid:13) krad and we measure
a correction factor, deﬁned as the ratio of the received dose
over the dose estimated from the linear-response assumption
(see Fig. 4). The dosimeters exposed around the CDF collision
hall have measured doses in the range of 0.1 rad to 1.2 krad.

D. Radiation measurements and effectiveness of shielding

(cid:26)(cid:25)

(cid:7)(cid:16)(cid:15)(cid:18)(cid:17)(cid:20)(cid:19)

TLD measurements are taken during three different periods
of the Tevatron operations. Table I shows the integrated beam
conditions during the three exposure periods: the number of
protons and antiprotons in the Tevatron, the number of lost
beam particles recorded, and the number of collisions in terms
of time-integrated luminosity,
_ corresponds to
about (cid:19)@+J(cid:3)*(cid:13)R_
interactions). The ﬁrst exposure period was
a test period; only a partial set of TLDs was installed around the
collision hall. We, therefore, focus our discussion to period 2
(June to October 2002) and period 3 (January to May 2003).
During a break in the Tevatron operations in January 2003
(just before period 3 commenced), shielding was installed
around the focusing quadrupoles on the proton side (see Fig. 5).
No shielding was installed on the antiproton side because the
beam losses are much smaller (see Table I).

If we assume that the collision contribution to the dose ( e
scales with the number of collisions, we expect that e
is the same in periods 2 and 3 at the points where we perform
our measurements. The fact that the dose rates are different
in period 3 than in period 2 means that the rate of the loss
) is different in the two periods (see
contributions ( e
Eqn. 2). Therefore, we conclude that the ‘ 25 a
reduction in
dose rates on the proton side, quoted in the previous paragraph,
is solely due to a reduction in the beam loss rates.

(cid:7))(cid:15)(cid:18)(cid:17)(cid:20)(cid:19)

Figure 7 shows the ratio of the dose rates on the proton and
antiproton sides, at several (cid:9)
locations in periods 2 (circles)
and 3 (stars). In both exposure periods, the dose rates on the
proton side are usually higher than those on the antiproton side.
In period 2 asymmetries as high as )(cid:17)(cid:13)Ma
are observed, whereas
in period 3, when the shielding on the proton side was installed,
. Given the symmetry of
this asymmetry is no more than (cid:28)(cid:30)(cid:13)Ra
the CDF detector, we can assume that the dose contribution
due to collisions does not exhibit a preference for positive (cid:9)
values over negative (cid:9) values. Thus, we expect the dose rate
asymmetry between the proton and antiproton sides to arise
from an asymmetry in the rate of loss contributions (see Eqn. 2).

III. MODELING THE RADIATION FIELD

The ionizing radiation measurements are parameterized using
a model based on previous CDF measurements of the silicon
radiation damage proﬁle [8] and direct radiation measurements
in the CDF tracking volume [9]. This model assumes cylindrical
symmetry of the radiation around the beam line, with a radial
is the
dependence which follows a power law in (cid:3)
distance from the beam line. For any point (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:3)
(cid:6)(cid:5)(cid:8)(cid:7) on a plane
perpendicular to the beam axis at (cid:9) , we write for the dose rate

(cid:15) , where (cid:15)

(cid:14).(cid:30)(cid:7)(cid:5)(cid:13) cm in exposure period 2.

The resulting normalizations and power law exponents are
shown in Figures 9 and 10 for measurements in periods 2 and
(cid:3)*(cid:13)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:17)(cid:13) cm, outside
3, respectively. For the region ./(cid:7)(cid:17)(cid:13)
the CDF main volume, the radiation ﬁeld behaves similarly
between the proton and antiproton sides; the normalizations are
of the same order of magnitude and the power law exponents
have values $Q‘K(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:4)
(cid:18) The situation is quite different
around the entrance points of the beams to the collision hall,
at (cid:9)
> 1860 cm. The radiation on the proton side has a
much higher normalization than on the antiproton side, but it
decreases much faster with the distance from the beam.

(cid:3)(cid:5)(cid:4)

The power law of Equation 3, with amplitudes and exponents
from Fig. 9 or Fig. 10, can be used to predict the radiation level
at any point surrounding the CDF detector.

IV. CONCLUSION

Using Thermal Luminescent Dosimeters (TLD’s) we have
presented a detailed measurement of the ionizing radiation ﬁeld
around the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF). Using data
from two exposures we are able to evaluate the effectiveness
of shielding installed on the proton side to reduce the radiation
levels. When a simple model assuming a power law in (cid:3)

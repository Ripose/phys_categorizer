Abstract

There are several applications which require high position resolution UV imaging. For these
applications we have developed and successfully tested a new version of a 2D UV single
photon imaging detector based on a microgap RPC. The main features of such a  detectors is
the high position resolution - 30 µm in digital form and the high quantum efficiency (1-8% in
the spectral interval of 220-140 nm). Additionally, they are spark- protected and can operate
without any feedback problems at high gains, close to a streamer mode. In attempts to extend
the sensitivity of RPCs to longer wavelengths we have successfully tested the operation of the
first sealed parallel-plate gaseous detectors with CsTe photocathodes.
Finally, the comparison with other types of photosensitive detectors is given and possible
fields of applications are identified.

1. Introduction

There are several applications which require high position resolution UV imaging. Examples
include: RICH, spectroscopy, hyperspectroscopy and various security checking devices. For
these applications we have recently developed 1D and 2D VUV (140-220nm) imaging
detectors based on microgap RPCs [1]. Their spectral sensitivity was determined by the
photosensitive elements used for this purpose: either gases with a low ionization potential or a
CsI photocathode. The counting rate characteristics of RPC are determined by the resisitivity
of the materials used for manufacturing  their anode and cathode planes.  The cathode of the
detectors mentioned above was made of low resistivity materials (<108cm) and was thus
able to operate at extremely high counting rate N up to 105Hz/mm2 [1]. If one exceeds some
critical gain (which depends on a value of N) then a glow discharge may appear [2]. It does no
harm the front- end electronics or the readout strips. However, glow discharges are very
sporadic, could be repeated in short periods of time and thus do not allow in an easy way to
achieve a high time resolution.
The aim of this work is to investigate whether the  “timing RPCs” [3] could be used as
photosensitive detectors. Timing RPCs are made of highly resistivity materials ( >1010cm).
In these detectors at high gains avalanches transit to streamers rather than to glow discharges.
The high gain avalanche mode operation with presence of some streamers allows to achieve
very  good time resolutions: better then 0,1 ns. The high resistivity of materials restricts of

course the rate characteristics of the detector; however, they still remain perfect for such
applications as RICH, time if flight BaF2 PET [4], 3D VUV locators [5] (see paragraph 4). 
The other aim of this work is to extend the sensitivity of gaseous detectors to longer
wavelengths by using CsTe photocathodes.  Note that it was demonstrated earlier that parallel-
late type gaseous detectors combined with photocathodes sensitive to visible light (SbCs,
GaAs and others) could operate in principle, however the maximum achievable gain is <100
[6]. This should be compared with gains   >105  achieved easily with CsI photocathodes [7].
The reason why the gain of gaseous detectors combined with SbCs photocathodes is  so low is
well understood  and described  in [8] (see p.3).  In the past we succeeded to boost the
maximum achievable gain of gaseous detectors combined with SbCs photocathodes by
exploring cascaded hole-type structure, for example capillary plates [9]. Such structures
allowed one to efficiently  suppress photon feedback and also reduce  ion feed backs [10,11].
Coming from the results presented  in [9] one can expect that with  CsTe photocathodes one
may reach high gains even with a simple parallel- plate structure without using the cascaded
hole type structures. Indeed, the probability of the photon feedback ph and ion feedback + are:
ph = I (A, E, ) Q () d 
and 
+ =k(-2), where
I is avalanche emission spectra,
A is a gas gain, 
E-the strength of the electric field,
-wavelength,
Q-the cathodes quantum efficiency,
k-coefficient,
-an ionization potential of the gas,
- photocathode affinity (work function).
Since the CsTe photocathode has the  function Q() and the value of  being in between the
corresponding functions and values of Q() and  for the CsI and the SbCs photocathodes,
one can expect the maximum achievable gain Amax will be also between the maximum
achievable gains of the detectors with CsI and SbCs photocathodes. This expectation was
supported by preliminary experiments with a sealed single-wire gaseous detector with  CsTe
photocathodes [12]. Gains close to 104 were achieved with this detector. However , strictly
speaking the avalanche light emission in parallel- plate  detector geometry and cylindrical
geometry could be different  since the strength of the electric filed is different [13]. As a result
the  feed back probability and the maximum achievable gains could be different.  Among
various possible parallel- plate structures designs a special place belongs to RPCs. This will
tremendously simplify the detector’s design and at the same time allow it to be spark-
protected.  Thus one of the aims of our work was to verify this experimentally. Unfortunately,
the  sensitivity of the CsTe  photocathode could be easily affected by tiny impurities and this
is why such detectors should be made of carefully chosen materials and be carefully sealed.
The long-term stability of such sealed detectors could be achieved only in low counting rate
applications because at low rates the  outgassing and aging are small. Thus low rate  RPCs
could be one of the best  options.

2. Experimental Set Up and RPC Designs  

An experimental set up for studies of the RPC is shown schematically in Fig 1. It contains a
VUV source (an Hg or a pulsed H2 lamp [14]), and a gas chamber inside which an RPC was

installed. In most  measurements the gas chamber was attached to an alignment table allowing
controllable movement in 2D direction to take place with a micron accuracy, as well as
rotation with the accuracy of a minute. A collimator with narrow- band filters or a VUV
spectrograph could be installed between the UV lamp and the gas chamber. The later was used
for detectors quantum efficiency  measurements (see [1] for more details). The gas chamber
was flushed by He+0.8%CH4+EF  [1] or C2H2F4+10%SF6+5%isobutene at a total pressure of
1 atm.
Two types of detectors were tested in this work:  modified “timing RPCs”[3] and gas filled
photodiodes  with CsTe photocathodes.
The modified “timing RPC” developed in the frame of the present work is shown in Fig. 2. Its
cathode was made of a MgF2 plate 40x40mm2 and 4mm thick. The inner surface of the MgF2
plate facing the anode was coated by a 20 nm thick CsI layer. No metallic coating was used to
ensure high surface resisitivity of the cathode. The outer surface of the MgF2 plate was coated
by a 0,2 m thick Al mesh manufactured from microelectronic technology. It had a pitch of
square cells of 30 m with the width of metallic part of 7 m. A cathode design was also
tested having only metallized strips of 50 m pitch. The anode of the RPC was made either of
Pestov glass coated by Cr strips of a 30 μm pitch or of a G10 plate with gold coated pixels of
1x1 mm2. The gap between the anode and the cathode was 0,4 mm. The design with strips on
the outer surface of the MgF2 cathode or with pixels on the G10 anode was oriented on 2D
measurements. Anode strips were connected individually to an ASIC readout chip. In some
simple measurements 20 central strips were connected to charge sensitive amplifiers and other
strips were grounded through a 3M resistor. In the case of the pixel readout 9 of the central
pixel were connected to charge sensitive amplifiers and others were grounded through a 3M
resistor. 
The ID and 2D position resolutions of this RPC were measured using collimators providing
either a cylindrical beam of 30 m in diameter or a rectangular beam 5 x 0,03 mm2. 
Prototypes of  sealed gaseous detectors with CsTe photocathodes were manufactured by us
from commercial vacuum photodiodes: Hamamatsu R702 and R1107, or from custom –made
photodiodes ordered from the Photonic Company MELZ, Moscow. One of the MELZ
photodiodes was manufactured by a special way: without  metalisation of the window on
which the semitransparent CsTe photocathde was evaporated. These photodiodes were
“converted” to gaseous detectors by the following procedure: they were installed inside a
special T-shaped sealed gas chamber having a CaF2 window, HV feed-trougths and
mechanical manipulators (see [15] for more details). The chamber was pumped for a few days
to a vacuum  better than 10-6 Torr after which either a He+0.8%CH4+ EF or an Ar+10%CH4,
or an Ar+5%isobutene  gas mixture was introduced. At this moment the small glass sealing in
the photodiode envelope was broken by a manipulator so that the gas could entered the
photodiodes. After filling with gas the MELZ photodiodes became in fact “RPCs” because
these detectors had a metallic anode and a cathode made of an insolating material. Of course
“classical” RPCs like the original Pestov one [16] or” timing” RPCs [3], have opposite
structure: metallic cathodes and dielectric anodes, however RPCs can operate if the anode is
metallic and the cathode is dielectric. In all tests the HV feeding of gas -filled photodiodes
was done via 3M resistors. 
The gain of the detectors was measure using a pulsed H2 lamp, allowing one to obtain a clear
signal even at a gain of one. We also performed some stability and aging measurements using
the set up described in [17].

3.  Results 

Fig. 3 a,b shows the results of position resolution measurements at two gains in the He+0.8%
CH4+EF mixture. In these measurements only one central strip (number 10 in the given plot)
on the anode plate was illuminated by a well- collimated UV beam (30 m in diameter) and a
counting rates from this and several neighboring strips were measured simultaneously. One
can see that in the He-based mixture at gains <105 the counting rate vs. the strip number has a
sharp maximum at the strip which was illuminated by UV (Fig. 3a). Thus a position resolution
of 30 m was achieved at low gains. However, with further increases of the gain the counting
rate profile begins to smear due to feedback problems and the position resolution degrades
(Fig. 3b). Fig. 4 shows image of two microslits  with width of 250 m and 150 m. In this
particular case strips were readout by ASIC.
In the C2H2F4+10%SF6+5%isobutene mixture the position resolution remained good until a
very high gain of  up to 106 (Fig. 5). However, in this mixture some degradation of the
quantum efficiency with the time was observed.  In this mixture the counting rate vs. the
voltage curve had some kind of  “plateau” region which is very important in single photon
counting Fig. 6. Signal amplitudes vs. rate  measured at two gas gains 1,5x106 and 5x106 are
presented in Fig. 7.
One can see from these data that at gains of 107 the RPC could operated at counting rates of
100Hz/cm2. This value is rather close to the rate characteristics of the conventional muon
RPCs (with <1011cm) used for tracking.
A detector with a pixelized G10 anode allowed one to obtain 2D images with a position
resolution of 1x1mm2 in  digital form-see Fig. 8.
Fig. 9 shows the quantum efficiency vs. the wavelength for the RPCs, vacuum photodiodes
and gas- filled photodetectors. One can see that the quantum efficiency of semitransparent CsI
photocathode was sufficiently high in order to be used in RICH or other low UV flux
measurements.
In the case of the photodiodes with CsTe photocathodes their quantum efficiency dropped
after the gas filling, but then remained stable for a long time ( Fig.10) The crucial point of
course is to realize   if the gas- filled photodiodes used in this work can operate at some gain.
As we have mentioned in the introduction, single wire detectors with CsTe photocathodes
could operate at gains of 104. However, it is not evident that the same gain could be achieved
with gas- filled photodetectors, because:  a)their design is not optimized for high gain
operations and b)as was mentioned above, the emission spectra of  Townsend avalanches in
parallel-plate detector’s geometry ( medium electric fields) could be different form the
emission spectra of  avalanches in the cylindrical geometry (very strong electric field near the
wire).
We have discovered that Hamamasu gas- filled photodiodes could operate at gains of 6-10
and that their maximum achievable gain was limited by sparks on sharp edges of the metallic
anode plate. Due to cathode resistivity, these sparks were weak and did not damage the
detector. One could reach gains of 100 with a UV beam well collimated  to center of the
detector (to avoid edge illumination) and at   very low UV fluxes . MELZ photodiodes had
rounded edges and as a result could operates at gains up to 103 with a low intensity collimated
beam (Fig.11). Some preliminary results of aging measurements are presented in Figs 12 and
13.

4. Comparison to other detectors and new filed of application of photosensitive RPCs

It will be interesting to compare developed RPCs with other types of photosensitive detectors.
Nowadays, the most popular photosensitive gaseous detectors are wire chambers [18]
combined with CsI photocathodes and cascaded capillary plate [19] or GEMs combined with
CsI photocathodes [20]. Compared to wire chambers the photosensitive RPCs have better

time and 2D position resolutions, can operate at higher gains and are spark-protective.
Compared to capillary plates and GEMs, photosensitive RPCs have a much simpler design, in
other words,  a compact planar geometry. Compared to solid –state detectors photosensitive
RPCs have practically the same position resolutions, but they much cheaper and do not
require any cooling (see a review paper [21]). Among vacuum detectors a serious competitor
to the photosensitive RPCs are only advanced MCPs having a position resolution of 12 m
[22]. However, MCPs are limited in size(they are less than 10x10cm2). Photosensitive RPCs
operating at 1 atm  have no mechanical constrains on the window size  and thus could be
made at very large area. Thus our RPCs can compete with MCPs in applications which require
large sensitive area, for example RICH, 3D locators [5], hyperspectroscopy [23]. The
applications of photosensitive gaseous detectors in RICH are described in many papers and
conference proceedings (see for example [18] and references there in).
For this reason in this report we would like to focus on much less known applications
requiring large sensitive area such as 3D UV locator and hyperspectroscopy. 3D UV locator is
based on a pulsed UV source (few tens of ps) and an optical system combined with 
position sensitive UV detectors. By a simultaneous measurements of the position of the
detected photon in the focal plane of the optical system and the time delay between the UV
pulse and detection of the particular photon one can reconstruct the with a high position
resolution a 3D image of the investigated object. 
Hyperspectroscopy is a new power method of remote surface image taking, providing
simultaneously high position and spectral resolution. 
 The spectral resolution of this method is around 1nm, i.e. hundred times better than colour
pictures. This allows to conclude from the analysis of the reflected light about the chemical
composition of the surface. As an example the Fig. 14 shows two superimposed images: a
usual photo (grey) and a hyperspectrographical synthesis image (colored) [24]. In the gray
image one can only recognize some structures on the surface. In contrast, from the
hypersepctrographic computer synthesized image one can identify the surface composition,
e.g. the yellow color is sand, the rouse color wheat earth, the blue color represents swam. One
can clearly see from this figure the advantages of the hyperspectroscopy over usual image
taking. Up to now the hypersepctroscopic method is used in a passive mode when the
reflective by the surface sun light is detected by a sophisticated optical system combined with
a special type of spectrograph readout by advanced MCPs [22] having position and spectral
resolution.
However hypersepctroscopy could be enforced by an  “active” mode for example by using an
external source with selected emission spectra, for example a UV sources (see Fig. 15). Large
area photosensitive RPCs can allow one to obtain complimentary images in the UV region of
spectra. Indeed, the reflection coefficient of the UV light is very small and one has to deal
with very small UV fluxes. Thus large area optical system and large area detector are
absolutely necessary. In this particular application photosensitive RPC will be superior
vacuum MCPs.
Gaseous detectors with CsTe photocathodes may also have a lot of applications as for
example in a multilayer time of flight BaF2 PET  [4] or flame imaging [25].
The concept of the multilayer time if flight BaF2 PET is presented in Fig.16 The multilayer
design allows one to reduce the parallax error in the image reconstruction. Preliminary tests
show that with the compact planar detectors with CsTe photocathodes one to obtain from few
hundreds to 1000 primary photolectons per Mev of the deposit energy in the BaF2 crystal,
sufficient to achieve good energy and time resolutions. For this application the ideal of course
will be to use timing photosensitive RPCs

The concept of position sensitive fire detector is presented in Fig. 17. It contains a UV
position sensitive detector with CsI or CsTe photocathodes combined with an optical system.

It is known that flames in air emit in UV region [26]. Such detector allows to obtain one  UV
images in the focal plane of the optical system and thus  to determine the position of flames in
space. Imaging capability makes this system multifunctional: it could not only obtain images
of flames, but also monitor and if necessary reject UV background or confusing UV sources
like sun.  This detector could  also be combined with several modulated external UV sources,
which give controllable monitoring signals in corresponding channels of the position-sensitive
detector. Appearance of smoke or mist  will attenuate this signal and allows one not only
detect their appearance, but also visualize them in space. 

 
5. Discussion and Conclusions

We have developed a photosensitive RPC with a semitransparent CsI photocathode able to
detect single photons with wavelengths of  <220nm. The main features are: extremely high
position resolution (30m in digital form), sufficiently high quantum efficiency and compact
planar geometry which s important for some applications, as for example, for RICH. They
also are spark- protected and thus are able to operate at high gains, necessary to achieve good
timing properties [27].
In addition we have tested gas -filled photodetectors with CsTe photocathodes. These
detectors were sensitive to wavelengths up to 300 nm. Some designs of these detectors were
able to operate at gains of Amax=103 and they were also spark -protected due to the high
resistivity of their cathodes. The achieved  gain is in between of Amax achieved with CsI and
SbSc photocathodes-see Fig. 18. The successful tests of these detectors opens the  possibility
to build sealed RPCs with CsTe photocathoes which  cold find many applications, as for
example  in RICH, spectroscopy [1], hyperspectroscopy [23], time of flight BaF2 PET[4], UV
locators [5], flame detectors [25].

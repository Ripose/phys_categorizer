Abstract 
 

The dynamics of two-dimensional electromagnetic (EM) pulses through one-dimensional 

photonic  crystals  (1DPC)  has  been  theoretically  studied.  Employing  the  time  expectation 

integral over the Poynting vector as the arrival time [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2370, (2000)], we 

show  that  the  superluminal  tunneling  process  of  EM  pulses  is  the  propagation  of  the  net 

forward-going  Poynting  vector  through  the  1DPC,  and  the  Hartman  effect  is  due  to  the 

saturation effect of the arrival time (smaller and smaller time accumulated) of the net forward 

energy flow caused by the interference effect of the forward and the backward field (from the 

interfaces of each layer) happened in the region before the 1DPC and in the front part of the 

1DPC.  

 

PACS number: 42.25.Bs, 42. 70. Qs 

Superluminal tunneling of an electromagnetic (EM) pulse propagating through a barrier 

has  been  a  subject  of  considerably  theoretical  attention  [1-4]  because  of  the  “mysterious” 

tunneling time delay independent of the barrier length, known as the Hartman effect [5]. This 

phenomenon was first noticed by MacColl more than 70 years ago [6].  It was confirmed by 

experimental  results  [2-3]  that  tunneling  time  delay  of  a  light  wave  packet  (or  a  photon) 

though a one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPC) is in good agreement with the prediction 

of the group delay by means of the stationary phase method. Other experiments by Enders and 

Nimtz [4] also showed that EM pulses travel with superluminal group velocity as they tunnel 

1

 

 

through an “undersized” waveguide. These observations lead to various arguments proposed 

to  explain  the  mechanism  of  superluminal  tunneling  and  why  superluminal  group  velocity 

does not violate causality. The argument based on the “pulse reshaping” was widely believed 

that the tunneling pulse comes from the small early front of the incident pulse [1]. Japha and 

Kurizki  [7]  further  argued  that  “predominantly  destructive  interference  between  accessible 

causal paths” is responsible for the tunneling attenuation, superluminal group delay and pulse 

reshaping.  Most  recently  Winful  [8,  9]  presented  a  different  description  by  introducing  the 

concepts  of  energy  storage  and  release  to  resolve  the  mystery,  and  he  thought  that 

“distortionless tunneling of electromagnetic pulses through a barrier is a quasistatic process” 

and  “the  envelopes  of  the  transmitted  and  reflected  fields  can  adiabatically  follows  the 

incident  pulse  with  only  a  small  delay  that  originates  from  energy  storage”.    However,  the 

question of how the tunneling pulse is carved from the incident pulse is still unsatisfying [10] 

(or not understood [11]), or say, remains hot controversial [12-13]. 

In this paper, we present the dynamics of the EM pulses through a finite 1DPC by using 

the  finite-pulsed  beams.  To  our  best  knowledge,  it  is  the  first  time  to  describe  the 

superluminal tunneling from the view point of energy transport by using the Poynting vector. 

As  mentioned  in  Ref.  [14],  for  the  EM  energy  flow,  the  field  is  solely  responsible  for  the 

energy transport [15]; this is true even if the total energy of a pulse is composed of the energy 

in the field and the energy stored in the medium. Meanwhile, only the Poynting vector can be 

measured  directly.  Therefore,  we  use  a  time  expectation  integral  [14]  over  the  net  forward-

going  Poynting  vector  as  the  arrival  time.  It  is  found  that  the  EM  tunneling  process  is  the 

propagation  of  the  net  forward-going  Poynting  vector  (i.  e.  the  net  energy  flow),  and  the 

tunneling  time  delay  is  directly  originated  from  the  arrival  time  of  the  net  forward  energy 

flow.  This  may  help  us  understand  the  dynamics  of  the  superluminal  tunneling  process  and 

the “Hartman effect”.

Recently  Winful  [8,  9]  used  the  concept  of  energy  storage  to  investigate  the  tunneling 

process using the total energy density. As mentioned by Diener [17], the total energy density 

is composed of two parts: one is the propagating energy and another is the non-propagating 

energy stored in the medium; the energy stored in the medium cannot propagate directly and 

is  not  responsible  for  the  energy  transport.  Another  kind  of  energy  carried  by  the  standing 

wave also cannot propagate [18]. In order to unfold the dynamics of the pulsed beam inside 

the finite 1DPC, the Poynting vector 

(the net energy flow) is used here. The change

where  the  unit  vector  uˆ  refers  to  the  direction  in  which  the  net  energy  flow  is  detected 

(normal to a detector surface). In our case we are interested in the arrival time of the NFEF, so

,  and 

mm 3=pcλ

(corresponding  to  the  angular  frequency

).  The  incident  2D 

pulsed  beam  is  normal  incident  from

 on  the  finite  1DPC  with 

0=θ

, 

mm 30=W

, 

ns 1.0=τ

 and 

pcωω =0

.  Figure  1(b)  shows  a  broad  photonic  band-gap 

structure with 

9=m

 and the spectral position of the incident 2D pulsed beam. It’s clear seen 

that the spectrum and angular spectrum of the incident pulsed beam is narrow and completely 

confined  within  the  photonic  band-gap.  So  it  is  expected  that  the  tunneling  pulse  is  with 

superluminal group delay. In our case, the group delay (defined by 

d
ωϕτ

g ≡

d

 [2], where ϕ 

is the phase of the transmission coefficient) is about 

ps 67.6

  which is much shorter than the 

time delay 

vτ

=

cL

/ =

ps 44.27

 passing through the same distance in the vacuum.  

Figure 2(a)-2(h) show the typically dynamic patterns of the net  energy flow for the 2D 

pulsed beam tunneling through the finite 1DPC at different times: at the initial time, the net 

energy  flow  is  forward-going  through  the  1DPC  because  the forward  field  is  predominated. 

As the pulse approaches to the 1DPC [near the time of the pulse peak arriving at the incident 

end 

0=z

,  i.  e.,    near 

)3/1(=t

ns],    the  net  energy  flow,  starting  from  the  off-axis  region 

(

0>y

),  begins  to  change  from  the  NFEF  to  the  NBEF,  see  Fig.  2(a)-(e).  Note  that  at  the 

 

6

position where the net energy flow changes from the NFEF to the NBEF, the net energy flow 

may align along the 

y+ (or 

y− ) direction for 

0>y

  (or 

0<y

), i.e. 

0=zs

. At these points 

the forward  z -component energy flow associated with the forward field cancels the backward 

z -component  energy  flow  associated  with  the  backward  electric  field.  Note  that  the  energy 

carried  by  the  standing  wave  or  stored  in  the  medium,  which  corresponds  to  the  non-

propagating  energy,  is  not  responsible  for  the  tunneling  pulse.  Once  the  net  energy  flow 

becomes the NBEF in a region, the NBEF has no more net contribution for the output pulse, 

because the backward field is predominated thereafter [18]. It is interesting that there appears 

a  clear  division  (i.e., 

0=zs

)  between  the  NFEF  and  the  NBEF  inside  the  1DPC  and  this 

division will be pushed forward and will be close to the exit end as the tunneling pulse leaves 

away from the 1DPC. Figures 2 (e) and (f) show that on left side of the division there is only 

the NBEF which leads to the reflected pulse and on right side of the division only the NFEF 

propagates  forward  and  through  the  exit  end  to  form  the  tunneling  pulse.  Therefore,  the 

tunneling pulse comes directly from the propagation of the NFEF.  

Now we are going to explain why the tunneling time is independent of the layers of the 

1DPCs,  i.e.  the  optical  Hartman  effect.  We  use  Eq.  (10)  to  calculate  the  arrival  time  of  the 

NFEF and to trace the tunneling process. For the points on the  z  axis, 

≡

,0

tz
),

 only has 

r
yS
(

the  z component. As discussed above, only the NFEF is responsible for the tunneling pulse, 

while the NBEF has no net contribution to the transmitted pulse [18]. Figure 3(a) shows the 

arrival times at the points on the z axis for the pulsed beam tunneling through the 1DPCs with 

different total layers. It is seen that the arrival times at the exit ends of the different 1DPCs are 

nearly  the  same  [see  the  open  triangles  on  each  curves  or  on  inset  (i)  of  Fig.3  (a)],  i.e.,  the 

Hartman  effect.  From  Fig.  3(a),  we  see  that,  before  the  incident  end,  the  time  needed  for 

propagating  a  unit  distance  is  shorter  than  that  for  the  vacuum,  and  becomes  smaller  and 

smaller as the pulse approaches the incident end, i.e., a saturation for the arrival time as the 

pulse  approaching  the  incident  surface.  The  change  from  NFEF  to NBEF  happens  nearly at 

 

7

the same time at different z (<0) points, see curves ①-④ in Fig. 3(b). As  m  increases (i.e., 

deep photonic band gap and large reflectivity), the transition time of the net energy flow from 

the NFEF to the NBEF occurs earlier [see open cycles on inset (i) of Fig. 3(a)]. The arrival 

time  at 

0=z

 decreases  (although  very  small)  with  increasing  m  [see  the  solid  cycles  on 

insert (i)]. The saturation is almost independent of  m  for large  m  before the incident surface 

(z<0).  In  the  front  layers  of  the  1DPC,  the  saturation  continues  with  almost  zero  time  for 

propagating  through  them  (for  example  from  ④-⑤).  As  m  increases,  the  saturation  effect 

immerges deeper and deeper into the 1DPCs. How deep the saturation will be depends on  m  

(the  reflectivity),  see  the  curves  for 

15 ,12 ,9=m

 in  Fig.  3(a).  The  higher  reflectivity,  the 

deeper  into  the  1DPC  the  saturation  will  be.  The  saturation  can  be  understood  in  the 

following.  As  the  pulse  approaching  the  1DPC,  more  and  more  energy  is  stored  [9]  into 

polarization  of  the  medium  and  the  forms  of  the  standing  wave  [18]  (the  non-propagating 

energy) due to reflection at surfaces between layers, which leads to that the “gravity center” 

of  the  effective  NFEF moves  quickly  forward  in space  before  and in  the  front of the  1DPC 

(i.e., shorter and shorter time spent). The effectively forward-propagating energy (the NFEF) 

decreases  greatly  until  the  stored  energy  will  gradually  release  into  the  NBEF  (forming  the 

reflected  pulse)  and  small  amount  into  NFEF (forming  the  output  pulse)  [see  Fig.  3(d)].  As 

the  pulse  enters  the  rear  part  of  the  1DPC,  the  time  needed  to  propagate  through  a  unit 

distance increases and finally becomes longer comparing with the vacuum case, because the 

reflected field becomes weaker and weaker due to less and less layers. The times in passing 

through the last a few layers are almost independent of  m [see inset (ii) of Fig. 3(a)]. Because 

the transition time from the NFEF to the NBEF happens later and later, see curves ⑤-⑨ in 

Fig 3(c), the arrival time (the “gravity center” of the NFEF) increases gradually to be identical 

with the tunneling time. That is to say, the “gravity center” of the NFEF moves very slowly in 

the rear part of the 1DPC. In fact, since the backward field becomes weaker and weaker in the 

rear  part,  the  energy  stored  in  the  standing  wave  and  the  medium  will  become  smaller  and 

 

8

smaller, which results in that the NFEF gradually tends to be identical with the energy flow of 

the tunneling pulse as it reaches the exit end (see the positive parts in the curves ⑤-⑨).  

Figure  4  shows  the  spatial-temporal  evolutions  for  the  forward  and  backward,  and  the 

total electric fields at points along the z axis of the 1DPC with m=9. Obviously, the forward 

electric field does decay inside  the 1DPC, like the  evanescent wave. Therefore,  the forward 

energy inside the 1DPC becomes less and less due to the reflection. The interference between 

the forward and backward fields lead to the strong standing wave before and in the front part 

of the 1DPC [see Fig. 4 (c)]. In the space-time domain, there is a clear division between the 

NFEF and the NBEF (see the blue dashed curve in Fig. 4 (c)), which leads to the saturation 

effect before and in the front part of the 1DPC [see Fig. 3 (a)] as discussed in above. In the 

space-time domain above the division, the backward field is dominated so that the net energy 

flow  is  the  NBEF,  which  has  no  net  contribution  to  the  tunneling  pulse.  Only  is  the  NFEF 

directly  responsible  for  the  tunneling  pulse,  see  the  arrows  in  Fig.  4  (c).  Therefore,  the 

tunneling time is the result of the arrival time of the NFEF.  

In  conclusion,  we  have  shown  the  dynamic  patterns  of  EM  pulses  through  the  finite 

1DPC.  From  the  point  view  of  net  forward  energy  flow,  see  Eq.  (10),  we  found  that  the 

superluminal  tunneling  process  of  EM  pulses  is  the  propagation  of  the  net  forward-going 

Poynting vector through the 1DPC, and the Hartman effect is due the saturation effect of the 

arrival time of the NFEF happened in the region before the 1DPC and in the front part of the 

1DPC  due  to  the  strong reflection  from all  the surfaces  between  layers.  The  contribution  to 

the arrival time for propagating through the region before the 1DPC and in the front part of it 

is very small, and the main contribution comes from propagating through the rear part of the

[18] In the region of 

z < , the total EM field is the superposition of the forward and backward 

L

fields.  We  can  rewrite  the  total  EM  field  as  ‘the  standing  wave  +  the  net  forward  (or 

backward)  field’.  Thus  the  net  energy  flow  is  only  associated  with  the  net  forward  (or 

backward) field, while the energy associated with the standing wave cannot propagate and is 

not responsible for the energy transport.

Abstract  

Optical beams with a new and distinctive type of helicity ha ve become the subject of much 

recent  interest.    While  circularly  polarised  light  comprises  photons  with  spin  angular 

momentum, these optically engineered ‘twisted beams’ (optical vortices) are endowed with 

orbital  angular  momentum.    Here,  the  wave- front  surface  of  the  electromagnetic  fields 

assumes  helical  form.    To  date,  optical  vortices  have  generally  been  studied  only  in  their 

interactions  with  achiral  matter.    This  study  assesses  what  new  features,  if  any,  can  be 

expected when such beams are used to interrogate a chiral system.

1.  Background 

Molecular chirality signifies  a structural handedness associated with variance under spatial 

inversion  or  a  combination  of  inversion  and  rotation,  equivalent  to  the  usually  stated 

criterion  of  a  lack  of  any  improper  axes  of  rotation.    Traditionally,  chiral  optics  engages 

circularly  polarized  light  –  even  in  the  case  of  optical  rotation,  interpretation  of  the 

phenomenon  commonly  requires  the  plane  polarized  state  to  be  understood  as  a 

superposition of circular polarizations with opposite handedness.  For circularly polarized 

light,  the  left- and right- forms designate the sign of intrinsic spin angular momentum,  ±h, 

and also the helicity of the locus described by the associated electromagnetic field vectors.  

For this reason its interactions with matter are enantiomerically specific.  

The considerable interest in  optical angular momentum has been enhanced through 

realisation of the possibility to engineer optical vortices [1-5].   Here, helicity is present in 

the wave- front surface of the electromagnetic fields and the associated angular momentum 

is termed ‘orbital’.  The radiation itself is commonly referred to as a ‘twisted’ or ‘helical’ 

beam.    Mostly,  optical  vortices  have  been  studied  only  in  their  interactions  with  achiral 

matter  –  the  only  apparent  exception  is  some  recent  work  on  liquid  crystals  [6-8].    It  is 

timely and of interest to assess what new features, if any, can be expected if such beams are 

used to interrogate any system whose optical response is associated with enantiomerically 

specific  molecules.    Section  2  introduces  salient  quantum  electrodynamical  principles for 

discussion,  in  section  3,  of  issues  relating  to  the  interplay  of  quantised  spin  and  orbital 

angular momentum  – the latter with particular reference to twisted beams.  The key results 

are summarised in section 4.

2.  Fundamental principles of molecular chirality 

We first have to construct in generalised form the criteria for manifestations of chirality in 

optical  interactions.    For  simplicity,  materials  with  a  unique  enantiomeric  specificity  are 

assumed – signifying a chirality that is intrinsic  and common  to all molecular components 

(or chromophores) involved in the optical response.  Results for systems of this kind will 

also  apply  to  single- molecule  studies.    Longer-range  translation/rotation  order  can  also 

produce chirality, as for example in  twisted  nematic crystals, but such mesoscopic chirality 

cannot  directly  engender  enantiomerically  specific  interactions.    The  only  exception  is 

where  optical  waves  probe  two  or  more  electronically  distinct,  dissymmetrically  oriented 

but intrinsically achiral molecules or chromophores (see below).   

Chiroptical  interactions can be  distinguished  by  their  electromagnetic  origins:  for 

molecular  systems   in  their  usual  singlet  electronic  ground  state,  they  involve  the spatial 

variation of  the electric and magnetic  fields associated with the input of optical radiation.  

This variation over space can be understood to engage chirality either through its coupling 

with  dissymmetrically  placed,  neighbouring  chromophore  groups  (Kirkwood’s  two-group 

model [9], of limited application) or more generally through the coupling of its associated 

electric  and  magnetic  fields  with  individual  groups.    As  chirality  signifies  a  local  breaking 

of parity  it permits an interference of electric and magnetic  interactions.  (Even in the two-

group case, the paired electric interactio ns of the system corespond  to electric and magnetic 

interactions of the single entity which the two groups comprise.  Thus, for convenience, the 

term ‘chiral centre’ is used in the following to denote either chromophore or molecule.

2.1 Quantum formulation 

In the framework of quantum electrodynamics, the Hamiltonian comprises the unperturbed 

operators  for  the  chiral  centre  and  the  radiation,  and  also  the  interaction  Hamiltonian, 

whose  role  as  perturbation  operator  leads  to  optical  transitions.    Each  component  of  the 

Hamiltonian is necessarily of even parity with respect to space inversion and also even with 

respect  to  time  reversal.    The  interaction  term  is  expressible  in  either  minimal  coupling 

form (in terms of the vector potential of the radiation field) or the more familiar multipolar 

formulation,  directly  expressed  in  terms  of  electric  and  magnetic  fields.      These two (and 

other)  options  lead  to  identical  results  for  real  processes,  that  is  those  subject  to  overall 

energy conservation [10, 11]; for convenience we use the multipolar form.   

The  multipolar  interaction  Hamiltonian  entails  a  linear  coupling  of  the  molecular 

polarisation  field  (accommodating  all  electric  multipoles  En)  with the  transverse  electric 

field 

( )
e r  of the radiation, and also a linear coupling of the molecular magnetisation field 

(all  magnetic  multipoles  Mn)  with  the  magnetic  field 

( )b r   of  the  radiation.  For present 

purposes we restrict  consideration to  the E1 and M1 interactions whose interplay  is  mostly 

associated with manifestations of chirality, leaving the electric quadrupole and other higher 

multipoles for detailed appraisal in a following piece of work.  The interaction Hamiltonian 

for a system of molecules labelled x is thus expressible as;

The electric dipoles 

  have  an  odd  signature  for  space  parity  and  even  for  time;  the 

( )rm

magnetic dipoles 

( )m r  have the opposite, even for space and odd for time.   Equally, the 

electric  field 

( )
e r of  the  radiation  field  is  space-odd  and  time-even,  while  the  magnetic 

field 

( )b r   is the  opposite.    Note,  however,  that  the  latter  assertions  are  true  only  for the 

electric and magnetic fields of the radiation as a whole,  not necessarily when only one or a 

finite  number  of  modes  is  considered  (independent  of  the  mode  expansion  used).    These 

and other fundamental symmetry properties are summarised in Table 1.   

The quantum amplitude Mfi for a specific optical interaction in a single chiral centre 

is  constructed  from  time-dependent perturbation theory and entails  a linear combination of 

scalars, each of which is the inner product of two rank r tensors: 

( )rS , comprising an outer 

product of radiation components (specifically, a product of components of the electric field 

and magnetic field) and 

( )rT , an outer product of molecular multipole components [12];

Here,  ? k  is  the  mismatch  between  the  wave-vector  sum  of  all  input  and  the  sum  of  all 

output  photons  (if  any)  involved  in  the  process  at  a  chiral  centre  x  located at  Rx  .    The 

molecular  tensor  T(r)  can  be  written  as  a  product  of  one  or  more  molecular  transition 

integrals, determined by the number of photons involved.  In every case the origin of such 

forms  is  a  single  transition  integral,  expressible  as  a  Dirac  bracket  with  the  appropriate 

number of electromagnetic interactions coupling the initial state to the final state.  In order 

for the transition integral not to vanish identically, the triple product of the group theoretic

representations for the initial and final state wavefunctions with that of the interaction must 

contain the totally symmetric representation.   

Before  considering  chiral  systems,  consider  the  case  of  a  centrosymmetric 

molecular  system.    Here,  the  only  non-zero  contributions  to  the  transition  integral  can  be 

those  whose  parity  equates  to  the  product  signature  of  the  initial  and  final  state 

wavefunctions.    For  example  if  electric  dipole  coupling  is  to  give  a  non-vanishing 

contribution then, for that transition, electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole contributions 

vanish  by  virtue  of  their  opposite  spatial  parity.    Thus,  for  centrosymmetric  species,  all 

multipolar contributions to any given quantum amplitude will have the same spatial parity.  

Clearly for chiral systems, where parity is not a good quantum number, no such rule applies 

and  the  amplitude  may  entail  contributions  of  both  positive  and  negative  parity.    In 

calculating the observable associated with a particular optical interaction it is usual to apply 

the Fermi Rule,

. 

For chiral species this includes, in addition to diagonal terms that are all of even parity in 

both radiation and molecular parameters, terms associated with the quantum interference of 

couplings with opposite parity, of odd parity for both the radiation and molecule. 

2.2 System response 

Not only molecular symmetry determines the nature and extent of any chiroptical response; 

macroscopic  symmetry  is  important  too.    In  particular,  when  the  system  of  interest  is  any 

fluid  or  other  microscopically  disordered  medium,  the  isotropic  symmetry  of  the  bulk

comes into play.  In general, measurements result from the optical interactions of more than 

one chiral centre, and the observable  signal results from a quantum amplitude comprising 

an ensemble sum of contributions.  As is apparent from the 

(
exp iD

(cid:215)k R  factor in (2), each 

)

of these contributions generally has a different phase associated with spatial variance in the 

registration of light at each  centre.   For most optical processes, which are  non-parametric 

(i.e. 

„k

0

),  the interference of  quantum  amplitudes  from  different  centres  gives  a  null 

contribution  when  those  centres  are  isotropically  distributed  –  except  in  certain 

nanomaterials  [13,14].    For  such  incoherent  processes,  no  role  is  played  by  any 

orientational  order  characterising  long-range  chirality.    Important  exceptions  arise  for 

parametric optical processes (

0

).  In the following, attention is focused on incoherent 

D =k

processes  for  two  reasons;  (i) it is processes of this category that are involved in the most 

common  manifestations  of  chirality  (circular  dichroism,  differential  Rayleigh  and  Raman 

scattering, circularly polarised  luminescence etc.; (ii) where optical vortices are concerned, 

it  is  known  that  parametric  processes  generally  entail  conservation  of  orbital  angular 

momentum by the radiation field, such that chirality is not engaged [15]. 

2.3 Incoherent processes; quantum interference terms  

We now  focus specifically on  chiroptical observables associated with incoherent processes 

in which the ensemble represents the time-averaged response of a single chiral centre.  For 

any such molecule the transition rate is a sum of amplitude contribution products, featuring 

amongst which are  quantum  interferences  which are odd in parity for both the matter and 

radiation – which  can only  arise in the case of chiral systems.  Handedness is apparent in 

D
 

8 

two  respects.    If  the  space  inversion  operator  (signifying  a  change  to  the  opposite 

enantiomeric  form)  is  applied  to  all  properties  of  the  molecule  –  and  in  particular  its 

multipole  moments  –  but  not  the  radiation  (signifying  retention  of  its  circularity), these 

interference terms change sign.   The  same  is  true  if the radiation changes handedness  but 

the  molecule  retains  its  enantiomeric  form:  all  contributions  to  the  signal  are  invariant  to 

inversion  of  the  whole  system.    This  is  why  chiral  interactions  must  involve  handed 

radiation.  Plane polarisations are invariant under space inversion; consequently, applying 

space  inversion  to  a  molecular  system  interacting  with  plane  polarised  light  has  the  same 

effect  as  applying  it  to  both  the  molecule  and  the  radiation,  and no chiral specificity  can 

emerge.  Optical rotation, as noted earlier, is an exception since it is a parametric process.   

For the  interference terms  that support chiral selectivity, further conditions need to 

be  satisfied  to  ensure  that  they  are  not  identically  zero.    For  any  component  of  a  non-

parametric signal  – and in particular the odd-parity quantum interference terms  – rotational 

averaging  effects  a  disentanglement  of  the  radiation  and  molecular  fields, 

)nS  and 
(

( )nT  

respectively.    Rotational averaging  results  in  a  product  of  scalars  (or,  for  tensors  of  rank 

four or more, a linear combination of such scalars), one scalar for the radiation and one for 

the  molecule.    Each  scalar  is  derived  by  contracting  the  tensor, 

)nS   or 
(

( )nT ,  with  an 

isotropic tensor of the same rank.  For example in the E1-M1 interference term for photon 

absorption  by  a  chiral  molecule  the  molecular  tensor

, on contraction with 

the  isotropic  tensor  of  rank  2  (the  Kronecker  delta),  yields  the  scalar

signifying  that  the  electric  and  magnetic  transition  moments  must  not  be  orthogonal  (in

chiral specificity is manifest.   Since T takes opposite signs for different enantiomers,

(5) 

the rate of absorption of left- handed circularly polarised radiation, for example, is different 

for  left-  and  right-handed enantiomers  –  though  only  marginally,  because  of  the  relative 

weakness  of  the  salient  interference  terms  compared  to  the  dominant  (usually  electric 

dipole)  diagonal  contributions  to  the  signal.     Equally,  each enantiomer  exhibits a slightly 

different rate of absorption for left and for right-handed circular input.  This is the origin of 

circular  dichroism.    Similar  remarks  apply  to  optically  more  intricate  processes  involving 

more  than  one  photon,  where  the  quantum  amplitude  itself  comprises  products  of 

multipolar couplings, each with a definite resultant spatial parity, and the key interference 

terms arise from products of these products with opposite inversion symmetry.  Again, for a 

chirally specific signal to emerge, it is necessary that the resultant radiation and molecular 

scalars do not vanish identically.

3.  The interactions of twisted beams  

We  now consider by what means, if any, the chirality of a twisted beam can engage with 

that  of  matter.    The  helicity  of  optical  vortices,  which  is  present  in  their  wave- front 

structure,  is  also  manifest  through  additional  phase  factors  in  the  positive  and  negative 

frequency components.  In particular, the analytic signal for the electric field  of a Laguerre-

Gaussian (LG) mode propagating in the z-direction is [16];

distribution  function;  l   is  the  orbital  angular  momentum  quantum  number,  for  which  a 

positive  sign  denotes  left  helicity  and  a  negative  sign,  right  [17].    Of  the  two  space-

dependent terms in the field phase, the first is the origin of the wave-vector mismatch factor 

in (2), and the second is an azimuthal phase factor characteristic of twisted beams.  The first 

component  of  the  phase  in  (6)  change s  sign  on  space  inversion  (and  on  complex 

conjugation)  just  as  the  circular  polarisation  vectors  behave.    The  second  phase  factor 

changes by addition of p on space inversion.  The magnetic field for a twisted beam has an 

exactly similar form [18].   

No difference should be expected between the behaviour of right and left forms of 

any  optical  vortex  if  the  photons  it  comprises  are  plane  polarised  and  the  material  they 

interact  with is achiral, in accordance with the dictates of parity.  This is equivalent to the 

case  of  circularly  polarised,  planar  wave- front  (e.g.  Gaussian)  modes,  interacting  with

achiral  material.    However,  there  are  several  differences  between  LG  photons and those 

associated  with  planar  wave- fronts.    In  the  present  context  a significant  difference  is  that 

plane waves have no restriction in the direction of propagation, while the symmetry of LG 

photons  designates propagation  in  one  directio n,  ˆz .    This  indicates  that  mirror  inversion 

along  a  plane  containing  the  ˆz axis  become s  the  relevant  symmetry  element.    Arguing 

symmetry on these grounds is sufficient to establish that there is no differentiation between 

LG beams of opposite handedness when achiral material is interrogated.   

The  interaction  of  an  optical  vortex  with  chiral  matter  affords  up  to  eight 

possibilities for combinations of different handedness; each molecule, each photon and the 

vortex itself can be of either handedness.  Consider first  the simpler case of  a vortex beam 

comprising  plane  polarised  photons,  superficially  analogous  to  the  case  of  circular 

polarisations  in  a  plane  wave.    Mirror  inversion  of  either  part  of  the  system  (molecule or 

radiation)  gives  a  system  different  from  the  original,  and  a  change  in  signal  signifying 

chiral  specificity  might  be  anticipated.    Representing  in  brackets  the  circularity  of  the 

radiation and the matter respectively, both cases require identity of  (L, L) and (R, R), and so 

too (L,  R) and (R, L).     However   (L, L)  and   (L,  R)   differ.    More succinctly, denoting 

either  handedness  L/R  by a  circularity  c  and  the  reverse  by 

*c ,  we  have  (

ccc c=
,

(

which may or may not be equal to  (

)*,c c

. 

For  the  twisted  beam  case  it  is  therefore  necessary to ascertain  whether  there  is  a 

mechanism, by means of which signals that are  permissibly  different  in  these terms may  in 

fact differ.  In  the previous section it  was seen that in a fluid, the  observable is obtained  as 
the ensemble sum of contributions from all relevant centres.  As in the case of plane waves

.  If the optical process is parametric, 

D =

 and all 

dependence on the sign of the  orbital  angular   momentum  of  the  radiation  is  lost.  The  

transition    rate,    proportional  to 

fiM ,  has  no  dependence  on  the  sign  of  the  orbital 

2

angular  momentum  l  and  therefore  is  not  a  chiral  discriminator.    For  a  non-parametric 

process where 

l

0

, the  incoherent  character  means  that  the  rate   is  proportional   to  

2

fiM

,  in  which  the  azimuthal  phase  factor  cancels;  again  the  transition  rate  does  not 

involve the orbital angular momentum or its sign.   

Finally  we  address  the  case  of  chiral  molecules  interacting  with  twisted  light 

comprising circular photons.  In view of the observations made above, the problem reduces 

to  exactly  that  which  applies  to  other  beams  of  circular  polarisation  – but  now  there  is  a 

mechanism  for  the  associated  signals  to  actually  differ.    Again  the  helicity  of  the  wave-

front  is  immaterial  so  far  as  chiral  specificity  is  concerned.    Consider  for  example  a  left-

handed  twisted  beam  comprising  left-handed circular photons interacting with a system of 

left- handed molecular enantiomers – and the simplest optical process in which chirality can 

be manifest, namely circular dichroism.   Then, the quantum interference terms responsible 

for chiral discrimination change sign if either the circularity of the photons or the isomeric 

form of the molecules is changed; the interference terms are invariant to a change of both.  

No component of the rate changes if, for example, the beam becomes a right-handed vortex

but the sense of the photons and molecular handedness is the same as before.  Note that this 

conclusion  is  contingent  upon  the  azimuthal  phase  factors  for  the  electric  and  magnetic 

fields being identical; however this is a necessary consequence of Maxwell’s equations, as 

has been shown explicitly for quantised Laguerre-Gaussian modes [15].  

 

4.  Conclusion 

Through analysis of the grounds for chiroptical behaviour  involving electric and magnetic 

dipole interactions it has been established that the helicity of optical vortices cannot engage 

through any  parametric or  non-parametric optical process with the chirality of a molecular 

system,  other  than  through  circularity  of  its  photons.    Thus,  the  manifestations  of  orbital 

angular  momentum  differ  markedly  from  those  associated  with  photon  spin  angular 

momentum.    Preliminary  work  on  circular  differential  scattering  suggests  that  our 

conclusions remain valid  even when electric quadrupole interactions are taken into account.  

Assessing  the  possible  chiral  selectivity  of  the  mechanical  interactions  of  such  twisted 

beams is a separate issue which merits separate attention. 

We  conclude  by  noting  one  exceptional  case,  where  certain  of  the  above 

assumptions  are  unwarranted,  concerning  second  harmonic  generation  by  reflection  at  a 

chiral  surface.    This  system  has  long-range  orientational  order,  and  local  chirality  is 

modified  as  the  space  within  which  surface  molecules  reside  is  no  longer  isotropic.    The 

process has parametric character, because surface reflection satisfies a reduced requirement 

for wave- vector  matching – one that applies only to the  surface-parallel components of the 

two input and single output photon wave-vectors.  As has been shown elsewhere [19, 20], a 

chirally  sensitive  response  then  emerges  through  electric  dipole  coupling  alone.    The

the system presents considerable experimental and theoretical challenges.

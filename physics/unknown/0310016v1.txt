in Spin-Orbit Interaction

The origin of the Thomas factor 1/2 in the spin-orbit hamiltonian can be
understood by considering the case of a classical electron moving in crossed
electric and magnetic fields chosen such that the electric Coulomb force is
balanced by the magnetic Lorentz force.

I. INTRODUCTION: THE PROBLEM

It is well-known that the spin-orbit Hamiltonian differs by a factor 1/2 — the
so-called Thomas Precession factor — from what one might expect from a
naive Lorentz transformation that assumes an uniform straight-line motion
of the electron. The naive argument runs as follows.

When an electron moves with the velocity v through space in the presence

of an electric field E, the electron will see, in its own moving frame of
reference, a Lorentz-transformed magnetic field

where c is the speed of light; the limit v << c is the case of interest here. It is
this Lorentz-transformed magnetic field that is supposedly seen by the
electron magnetic moment.

This argument suggests that in the presence of electric fields, the magnetic

field B in the spin Hamiltonian should be replaced by  B
ˆv  is the velocity operator. This conclusion does not to agree with observed
atomic spectra. Historically, this discrepancy provided a major puzzle [1],
until it was pointed out by Thomas [2] that the argument overlooks a second
relativistic effect that is less widely known, but is of the same order of

magnitude: An electric field with a component perpendicular to the electron
velocity causes an additional acceleration of the electron perpendicular to its
instantaneous velocity, leading to a curved electron trajectory. In essence, the
electron moves in a rotating frame of reference, implying an additional
precession of the electron, called the Thomas precession. A detailed treatment
is given, for example, by Jackson [3], where it is shown that this changes the
interaction of the moving electron spin with the electric field, and that the net
result is that the spin-orbit interaction is cut into half, as if the magnetic field
seen by the electron has only one-half the value (1),

It is this modified result that is in agreement with experiment.

A rigorous derivation [3] of this (classical) result requires a knowledge of

some aspects of relativistic kinematics which, although not difficult, are
unfamiliar to most students. In a course on relativistic quantum mechanics,
the result (2) can be derived directly from the Dirac equation, without
reference to classical relativistic kinematics. But in a non-relativistic QM
course, the instructor is likely to be compelled to an unsatisfactory “it can be
shown that” argumentation, which is in fact the approach taken in most
textbooks.

In a 1994 textbook of my own [4], I tried to go beyond that approach by
considering the case where the electron is forced to move along a straight
line, by adding a magnetic field in the rest frame such that the magnetic
Lorentz force would exactly balance the electric force. In this case, the
Thomas factor of 1/2 was indeed obtained, but the argument — especially its
extension to more general cases — lacked rigor. Moreover, by having been
published outside the mainstream physics literature, it remained largely
unknown to potentially interested readers inside that mainstream. The
purpose of the present note is to put the argument onto a more rigorous basis,
and to do so in a more readily accessible medium.

II. CROSSED-FIELD TREATMENT

From our perspective, the central aspect of the “standard” Lorentz transform
(1) is the following: The transform Erest ⇒ Belectron must be linear in E, and E
can occur only in the combination   E v× . This combination reflects the two

p.3

facts that only the component of E perpendicular to the velocity v can play a
role, and that the resulting B-field must be perpendicular to both E and v.

In the absence of any specific arguments to the contrary, we would expect

that this proportionality to   E v×  carries over to the case of a curved
trajectory. (For example, a component of E parallel to v would not contribute
to a curved trajectory and to the accompanying rotation of the electron frame
of reference.) If one accepts this argument, it follows that    ′B  ≡ Belectron
should be given by an expression of the general form

with some scalar proportionality factor α that may still depend on the
velocity, but which cannot depend on either E or on any magnetic field B that
may also be present in the rest frame. If there is a magnetic field B present in
the rest frame, (3) should be generalized to

where β  is another constant subject to the same constraints as α.

To determine the two constants α and β, we consider not simply the

Lorentz transformation of a pure electric field E, but of a specific combination
of electric and magnetic fields such that

where v is the velocity of the electron, and B is chosen perpendicular to v. For
this combination, the electric Coulomb force and the magnetic Lorentz force
on the electron cancel, and the electron will move along a straight line. But in
this case the simple Lorentz transformation for uniform straight-line motion
is rigorously applicable, without having to worry about a rotating frame of
reference.

Without loss of generality, we may chose a cartesian coordinate system

such that the velocity is in the x-direction, the magnetic field in the z-
direction; and the electric field in the y-direction,

which is of the required form (4), with α = 1/2 and β = 1.

This is the magnetic field that is seen by the intrinsic magnetic moment of

the electron. It determines the potential energy of that moment in the
presence of both electric and magnetic fields for our specific combination of
crossed fields, up to orders linear in     E v× ˆ . The leading B- term is already
included in the non-relativistic spin hamiltonian; the remainder is the first-
order correction due to the spin - orbit interaction. Note that it contains the
Thomas factor 1/2, in agreement with (2).

The rest is straightforward. Our argument suggests that the magnetic field

B in the spin hamiltonian should be replaced with an operator that is
equivalent to (9b). Following standard textbook arguments, we obtain the
familiar spin-orbit contribution to the hamiltonian

III. DISCUSSION

The central assumption in our derivation was that the proportionality of     ′B
to     E v× ˆ  carries over to the case of a rotating frame of reference. This is of
course an exact result. But in a paper explicitly dedicated to the classroom
didactics of the Thomas factor without invoking less-well-known aspects of
relativistic kinematics, it is probably best to treat it as an eminently plausible
assumption.

I close with a comment on our retention of the Bzvx

2-term in (7), albeit
converted into a Eyvx -term. This term takes the place of rotating-frame
corrections in the case of a pure electric field. Neglecting it would be exactly
equivalent to neglecting the effects of a rotating frame of reference for a more
general choice of fields.

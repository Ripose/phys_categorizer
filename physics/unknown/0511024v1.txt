 for the rate

this case the optimal choice of the scale exponent c is not unique. It is shown how different c's are related to different types of spatial averag-
  and  what are the c's for  which the  distributions  of  aL  best  agree for  small L. Theoretical analysis is tested  using

1. Introduction  

Certain  classical  laws  of  seismicity,  namely,  the  Omori  law 
for aftershocks and  the  Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) relation for 
earthquake energy, are reflections of one-dimensional proper-
ties  exhibited  by  self-similar  seismicity.  Recent  studies  (see 
Bak  et  al.,  2002;  Corral,  2003,  2004;  Baiesi  and  Paszuski, 
2004b;  Tosi  et  al.,  2004;  Abe  and  Suzuki,  2004)  search  for 
similar  properties  of  earthquakes  in  the  multidimensional 
phase space of location-time-magnitude. The results obtained 
along this line of  research introduce substantial  changes into 
the conventional notions of seismicity; therefore, analyrifica-
tion are in order.

The  pioneering  work  of  Bak  et  al.  (2002)  is  concerned 
Lτ   between  succes-
with  the  distribution  of  interevent  time 
sive events of magnitude M > m in a L×L cell. These authors 
Lτ   over  all  L×L  cells  of 
averaged  observed  distributions  of 
the grid covering a seismic zone G to find that

where  τF   is  a  unified  (i.e.,  independent  of    m  and  L)  func-
tion, and  Lλ  is a measure of M > m events per unit time in an 
L×L cell. The  contribution of a cell into the averaging result 
is proportional to the  number  of  such events  in the cell. The 
following representation is used:  
 
a
= 10
where  the  quantity    b  is  the  slope  in  the  Gutenberg-Richter 
law, while the exponent  c is associated with a fractal dimen-
sion of earthquake epicenters, i.e., 0 ≤ c ≤ 2.

Keilis-Borok  et  al.  (1989)  seem  to  have  been  the  first  to 
put forward relation (2) as a generalization of the G-R law for 
a "typical" area of size L, when seismic events  are subject to 
fractal  geometry.  Viewed  as  such,  (2)  gives  rise  to  several 
queries:  
     – Why is it that the parameter  c is independent of m?  
     – If  c is a fractal dimension, exactly which one is it?  
There is a whole one-parameter family of the so-called Renyi 
dimensions  or  generalized  dimensions  in  the  terminology  of 
.  The  most

popular  of  these  are  the  correlation  dimension 

2d   and  the 
0d . The procedure of estimating the 
capacity/box dimension 
exponent leads to the correlation dimension both in the origi-
nal work (Keilis-Borok  et al., 1989) and in a later follow-up 
study  (Kossobokov  and  Nekrasova,  2004),  although  the  rea-
sons  for  introducing  (2)  are  based  on  the  box  dimension. 
Some workers are using (2) for the same purposes in one and 
the  same  area  (California)  with  different  exponents  c: 
0d  = 1.6  (see  Bak  et  al.,  2002,  and  Corral, 
2d  = 1.2  and 
2003, or else Baiesi and Paszuski: 2004a and 2004b).  

(λ

The situation  gets  more complicated, when the reasoning 
of  Pisarenko  and  Golubeva  (1996)  is  considered.  These 
workers  start  from  the  hypothesis  of  self-similarity  for  seis-
micity  in  space-time  and  develop  a  model  where  M > m 
events form a Poisson process in any subregion A of region G 
with a random  rate λ (A). To  be  more specific, the set  func-
tion  λ (A)  is  a  sample  of  a  random  Levy  measure,  i.e.,  a 
measure  with  independent  increments  and  a  stable  distribu-
tion  of  the  index  0 < α < 1.  The  case  α ≥ 1  is  impossible, 
because λ (A) is positive. In this model one has for every L×L 
cell:  
 

L
where  c = 2/α > 2.  (A  formal  averaging  of 
  over 
the cells must lead to relation (2) with the average parameter 
a).  Pisarenko  and  Golubeva  (1996)  give α = 0.57  for  south-
ern  California,  from  which  one  gets  a  most  unusual  value, 
c = 3.5.  From  the  model  it  follows  that  the  population  of 
{ La
  obeys  a  unified    distribution,  namely,  the  stable  Levy 
distribution  with  index  α < 1.  Consequently,

for x>>1. In that case, however,  La  does not have the 
ordinary mean value, and  so the parameter  a in (2)  may be-
come  meaningless  within  the  framework  of  the  model  con-
sidered.

The above model is of interest in that it suggests a gener-
alized  frequency-magnitude  relation  of  a  more  flexible  form 
than  (2).  It  is  specified  by  (3)  with  a  unified  distribution  of

with the unified function  λF  involved.  That circumstance is 
not trivial, since the analogous relation (1) can hold approxi-
mately  only.  If  (1)  holds  exactly,  the  spatial  rate  of  M > m 
events must be constant in G (see Molchan, 2005).

 and c = 3.5.  

It thus appears that the choice of a suitable exponent  c for 
deriving  unified  seismicity  laws  remains  an  open  question. 
The  phrase  suitable  exponent  will  be  interpreted  as  follows:

Below  the  choice  of  c  will  be  discussed  for  the  statistic 
. In that case theory can predict certain things, if one 
LL ×λ
assumes  multifractality  for  the  measure 
  which 
gives the rate of M > m events per unit time in an area dg. For 
qd  are de-
measures of this type the generalized dimensions 
fined, and some of them are not identical. It should be admit-
ted at once that the hypothesis of  multifractality for seismic-
ity  has  both  adherents  (Geilikman  et  al.,  1990;  Hirata  and 
Imoto,  1991;  Hirobayashi  et  al.,  1992;  Godano  et  al.,  1999) 
and  opponents  (Gonzato  et  al.,  1998;  Eneva,  1996).  This  is 
not  surprising.  Multifractality  is  a  sophisticated  idealization 
of physical objects demonstrating a diversity of local similar-
ity, the full spectrum of a multifractal is difficult to measure; 
besides,  multifractal  objects  are  not  always  easily  disctin-
guishable  from  pseudo-fractals  or  their  intermediate  forms, 
even when extensive data is available (see  examples in  Gor-
ski,  2001;  Molchan  and  Turcotte,  2002).  In  practical  terms, 
the best that can be done is to observe a multifractal behavior 
of the measure in a range of scales ∆L. In that case the quan-
tity  c  in (2) becomes a parameter for the unified law under 
study in the range  ∆L. Below, our theoretical analysis  of the

These  statements  constitute  the  content  of  multifractal  for-

many  mathematical  examples.  There  are  pathologic  cases  in 
which the function -τ (q) exists, but not is convex. Practically 
important examples of such pseudomultifractals can be found

A comparison between distributions gives rise to the issue 
of 
Levy  metric 
(Feller, 1966, Ch.8 §10) is quite sufficient for the case under 
consideration; the  metric is  actively employed in probability 
theory  when  examining  the  convergence  of  distributions. 
This  metric  concentrates  on  divergences  between  distribu-
tions in the region where the bulk of the distribution lies, be-
ing  less  sensitive  to  the  behavior  of  tails.  In  our  case  small 
values  of

Lξ   are  related  to  small  numbers  of 
hence are very inaccurate. On the other hand, large  values of 
Lξ  involve small relative errors. However, the frequencies of 
occurrence  for  very  large 
Lξ   are  low.  They  are  supplied  by 
aftershock  sequences  with  high  concentrations  in  L×L  cells. 
Such  sequences  are  few  for  a  period  of  T = 20  years,  hence 
the estimation  of probabilities of large  values  of 
Lξ  may  be 
extremely  unstable.  The  Levy  metric  can  be  informally  de-
fined as follows.

For  opponents  of  multifractality  one  can  express  oneself 
in  a  different  manner:  the  result  shows  that  the  multifractal 
formalism  is  effective  in  solving  the  problem  of  the  spatial 
scaling of seismicity rate. An important place is  occupied by 
the box counting approach which was used to estimate fractal 
dimensions.  The  approach  well  matches  the  problem  we  are 
considering,  because  both  of  these  cases  are  concerned  with 
 in squares  of size L  belonging to a rec-
values  of 
tangular  grid.    Quite  independent  of  any  interpretation  to  be 
put  on  the  final  result,  one  can  draw  the  following  practical 
inference: in situations where seismicity is scaled over space, 
the exponent c must be treated as a parameter. At present the 
scaling  is  used  in  the  analysis  of  unified  laws  (Bak  et  al., 
2002; Corral, 2003), in certain prediction techniques (Baiesi, 
2004), and for aftershock identification (Baiesi and Paczuski, 
2004a,b).

We did not try to address the question of how the parame-
0d , depend  on the 
ter c  or, in  particular, the box dimension 
cutoff  magnitude  m.  A  rigorous  solution  encounters  great 
difficulties.  As  m  increases,  the  straightforward  analysis  of 
scaling  indices  becomes  difficult  for  statistical  reasons  (see 
the  example  in  Fig. 3).  When  large  events  are  concerned, 
source dimension should be taken into account. For  this rea-
son,  similarity  considerations  will  call  for  greater  sampling 
area, and this will lead to problems with catalogs. The theory 
developed  in  Gorshkov  et  al.  (2003)  as  to  the  occurrence  of 
large earthquakes on high rank lineaments and their intersec-
0d  
tions  provides  an  indirect  indication  that  the  dimension 
must  decrease  with  increasing  magnitude.  On  an  earthwide 
scale  great  earthquakes  occur  at  plate  boundaries,  and  the 
plate dimension in the same scale is naturally associated with 
1, when one deals with intersections of plates with the Earth's 
surface.  On the whole the above hypothesis  calls for serious 
statistical testing.

Abstract 

Ionization  of  polar  liquids  and  glasses  often  yields  metastable  electron  centers 

collectively known as “weakly bound” (wb) electrons that absorb to the red of the ground state of 

the  solvated/trapped  electron.  Formation  of  these  species  is  thought  to  be  the  initial  stage  of 

electron localization in such media. Although these commonly occurring species have distinctive 

absorption spectra, no insight into their structure currently exists. In this Letter, we address the 

structure of the wb electron in low-temperature ice-Ih theoretically, using a combination of mixed 

quantum-classical  (MQC)  floating  set  of  Gaussian  orbitals  (FSGO)  –  Metropolis  Monte  Carlo 

(MC)  method  and  “embedded  cluster”  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  post  treatment.  The 

comparison with the observed properties of the wb electron in ice suggests that this species is an 

s-like wavefunction filling a water vacancy.

Excess (“solvated”) electrons in liquids (e.g., 1-8) and large gas phase cluster anions (e.g., 
 
9-13) composed of hydroxylic molecules, such as water and alcohols, are currently the subject of 

many  experimental  and theoretical studies. The resurgence of interest to  such species is driven 
by  the  emergence  of  new  experimental  techniques,  including  ultrafast  pump-probe,  14,15  time-
resolved  resonance  Raman,  7,8  and  angle-resolved  photoelectron  12,13  spectroscopies  as  well  as 
advances in computer modeling of their structure and dynamics (e.g., 2-6). The ground state of a 

strongly bound (sb) electron in liquid water is a species in which an s-like electron wavefunction 
fills a solvation cavity formed by 4-8 dangling (non-hydrogen-bonding) OH groups, 1-8 with ca. 

 

1 

80%  of  the  spin  density  residing  inside  the  cavity  and  the  rest  shared  by  frontier  orbitals  of 
oxygen  atoms  in  the  solvating  OH  groups.  2  Apart  from  this  ground  state  species,  short-lived 

intermediate  states  of  electron  solvation/trapping,  known  collectively  as  “weakly  bound”  (wb) 
electrons  16-19 that absorb to the red of the sb species have been observed in many polar liquids 
16,17,18 and glasses, 19 but the structure of this commonly occurring excess electron species has not 
yet been elucidated. It has been suggested 18,19 that the wb electrons are formed via localization 

in  cavities  formed  by  fewer  OH  groups  and/or  methyl/methylene  groups  of  the  solvent,  but  no 

direct  support  for  such  a  scenario  presently  exists.  In  this  Letter,  we  seek  to  determine  the 

structure of this species  in the simplest molecular system that  yields such wb electrons: proton 

disordered, low-temperature hexagonal water ice (Ih). 

Ice-Ih is convenient for such studies due to the regularity of its structure and exceptional 

stability  of  the  wb  electron  at  low  temperature.  As  the  ice  lattice  exhibits  large  channels  along 
the c-axis and spacious 12-molecule cages capable of accommodating an extra water molecule, 20 

electron  solvation  in  ice  is  intermediate  between  the  solvation  in  liquid  water  and  electron 

localization  at  the  surfaces  of  gas  phase  water  clusters.  One  may  expect  that  the  wb  electron 

would occupy these preexisting cavities and bind to fortuitously oriented water molecules at their 
surface.  Below  73  K,  radiolysis  of  ice-Ih  yields  two  kinds  of  electron  centers.  21  The  strongly 

bound electron is a short-lived species that absorbs in the visible, with the absorption maximum 
at  1.97  eV  21  (vs.  1.7  eV  for  liquid  water).  1    The  weakly  bound  electron  absorbs  in  the  near 

infrared  (with  the  absorption  maximum  at  ca.  0.42  eV)  and  slowly  decays  by  tunneling  to  a 
nearby  hole  center  (such  as  O-,  OH,  and  H3O+)  on  the  millisecond  time  scale.  21  At  higher 
temperature  (120  K),  Kawabata  et  al.  22  observed  a  different  wb  species  with  the  absorption 

maximum at 1.24 eV. The lifetime of the sb electron at 6 K (77 K) is 8 ns (75 ns) in H2O ice and 
120 ns (5 m s) in D2O ice, 21 indicating large isotope effect on the recombination of the sb electron 

with the parent hole center (the hydronium ion). These short lifetimes suggest that the sb electron 

is  localized  near  the  site  of  ionization,  possibly  due  to  the  lattice  distortions  introduced  by  the 

species generated via disintegration of the holes or local lattice melting by the heat of ionization. 
By  contrast,  the  wb  electron  is  trapped  in  the  bulk,  apparently  by  an  abundant  defect  in  ice.  21 

Electron  paramagnetic  resonance  (EPR)  spectrum  of  the  wb  electron  in  D2O  ice  at  4.2  K  has 
been  reported  by  Johnson  and  Moulton  23  and  Hase  and  Kawabata.  24  In  H2O  ice,  the  peak-to-

peak  width  of  the  structureless,  single  EPR  line  would  correspond  to  8.3  G  which  gives  the 

second moment of  M2

Whereas  there  are  many  mixed  quantum  classical  (MQC)  one-electron  (e.g.,  4-6)  and, 
 
more recently, multi-electron 25,26 molecular dynamics (MD) calculations for hydrated electrons 

in liquid water, there have been no such calculations for water ice; only  crude semi-continuum 
and dipole relaxation models have been used. Kevan 27 and Julienne and Gary, 28  following the 
suggestions of Buxton et al. 29 and Nilsson, 30 speculated that the wb electron localizes inside the 

ice cage  as a polaron, by  reorientation of the  water molecules so that their dipoles point to the 
common  center.  De  Haas  et  al.  21  argued  that  the  trapping  site  is  likely  to  be  a  VD  defect 

(positively  vested  vacancy).  The  latter  is  a  combination  of  a  water  vacancy  (V)  center  and  a 
Bjerrum (proton ordering) D-defect 20 (-OH HO-); in this VD defect, there are three dangling OH 

bonds.  

We address the structure of the wb electron in ice using the combination of two methods: 

an MQC one-electron model based upon the “floating set of Gaussian orbitals” (FSGO) approach 
5  that  was  implemented  as  a  Metropolis  Monte-Carlo  (MMC)  code,  as  this  implementation  is 

more suitable for calculations at low temperature. Electrons trapped by cages (C), vacancies (V), 
interstitials  (I),  Bjerrum  D-  and  L-defects,  20  and  positively  (VD)  and  negatively  (VL)  vested 

vacancies were systematically examined. The MMC ensembles were subsequently used as input 

for density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the B3LYP/6-311++G** method in which 

20-30  water  molecules  constituting  the  trapping  site  were  "embedded"  in  a  larger  matrix  of 
fractional  point  charges  representing  the  ice  lattice  (corresponding  to  SPC  water  model).  32 
Averaging  over  an  ensemble  of  200  configurations  taken  every  103-4  cycles  of  the  MMC 

calculation yielded statistically average properties of the electron centers for a given temperature. 

The latter was chosen to be 200 K for VD defects and 50 K for other lattice defects. 

A spherical ice-Ih nanocluster of 440 water molecules with the frame origin centered on 

the middle of an ice cage was constructed using a 13.5 Å x 15.6 Å x 14.6 Å hypercell of 96 water 
molecules  with  near-zero  overall  dipole  moment  as  constructed  by  Buch  et  al.  33  This  cluster 

included  all  water  molecules  within  15  Å  of  the  frame  origin.  The  V  defects  were  created  by 

elimination  of  one  of  the  water  molecules  forming  the  central  cage,  and  the  I  defects  were 
created by placing a water molecule at the center of this cage. Bjerrum D- and L- defects 20 were 

 

3 

created by changing the orientation of one of the water molecules forming the central cage and 

then propagating hydrogen bonds towards the nanocluster surface, in a way similar to the method 
described by Rick and Haymet. 34 An SPC/Fw  model 32 was used for water and the electron was 
represented by the wavefunction f  expanded on a set of primitive Gaussian orbitals with a radial 

function  of  the  type

  arranged  in  s-,  p-,  and  d-  shells  centered  on  X,  the

. This radius characterizes the spatial extent of the electron wavefunction.  

To explore a larger configuration space, only water atoms within a sphere of radius 5.5 Å 

from the frame origin were moved. The OH bonds at the surface of this inner cluster were fixed 

and  small  random  (for  molecules  at  the  interface,  constrained)  rotations  and  vibrations  of  all 

water  molecules  in  this  inner  cluster  constituted  a  single  step  of  the  MMC  calculation.  In  the 
typical calculation, the defect was first equilibrated over 105 cycles, and then two FSGO MMC 
calculations of the total length of 104-5 cycles were carried out. In the first calculation, electron 

energy was excluded from the total energy, so the corresponding FSGO solution represented the 

excess electron in an unrelaxed structural defect (indicated in the following by the subscript “n”). 

In  the  second  calculation,  this  term  was  included  and  the  ensemble  of  relaxed,  electron-filled 

defects was obtained. For comparison, we also calculated the properties of the electron in liquid 

water, using the MQC MD ensemble generated in ref. 2 as input. The typical orbitals for the (s-

like)  singly  occupied  and  the  (p-like)  lowest  unoccupied  states  are  shown  in  the  Supplement

(Figures 1S-4S).  36 For VD- center (in which there are three dangling OH bonds) and V- center 

(in which there are two dangling OH bonds) the wavefunction resembles the s-electron in liquid 

water,  as  the  excess  electron  density  is  confined  to  a  small  cavity  formed  by  these  dangling 
bonds.  By  contrast,  the  “polaron”  (C-)  wavefunction  completely  occupies  two  neighboring  ice 

cages.  The  calculated  orbital  energies  and 

p

  transition  energies  are  given  in  Table  1  (for 

s ‹

FSGO  calculation)  and  Table  2  (for  DFT  calculation;  more  complete  tables  are  given  in  the 
Supplement). At the FSGO level, only VD- and VDn
- defects have positive vertical detachment 
energy (VDE) of ≈0.7 and ≈0.1 eV, respectively, which are considerably lower than the value of 
2.7 eV calculated for liquid water (vs. the experimental estimate of 3.3 eV given by Coe et al. 13).  

The  calculated  absorption  spectra  shown  in  Figure  1  are  broad  lines  composed  of  the  three 

merged  s-p  transitions  involving  the  three  nondegenerate  p-like  states.  For  liquid  water,  the 

calculated absorption maximum is at 1.9 eV, which is ca. 0.2 eV greater than the experimental 
value  of  1.7  eV.  1  For  VD-  center  at  200  K,  the  band  maximum  is  at  1.2  eV.  If  the  absorption 

spectrum of the wb electron in low-temperature ice-Ih were from these s-p transitions, that would 
eliminate the VD- center as a candidate. On the other hand, these energetics would be consistent 
with the 1.24 eV absorbing species observed by Kawabata at 120 K. 22  By contrast, VDn
-, V-, I-, 
and C- centers all absorb below 1 eV, with the V- center absorbing at 0.8 eV. Given that MQC 
calculations  in  general  yield  absorption  spectra  that  are  blue-shifted  by  0.2-0.3  eV,  2-6  these 
- and V- defects support the 

defects could be candidates for the wb electron. However, only VDn

sufficient bandwidth to  account  for the observed extent of the experimental spectrum, with the 
onset  of  the  band  at  1.3  eV.  21  The  position  of  the  absorption  maximum  correlates  with  the 
spatial  extent  of  the  s-like  wave  function,  as  rg  increases  from  3.37  Å  for  VD-  to  5.8  Å  for  C- 

(Table 1). 

In  the  “embedded  cluster”  DFT  calculations,  only  part  of  the  electron  density  resides 

inside the solvation cavity (Figure 2). A fraction of the unpaired electron density spreads over the 

O  2p  orbitals  of  the  water  molecules  that  form  the  cavity.  This  fraction  (

quantified as explained in ref. 2; it systematically decreases from VD- to V- and VDn
and  C-  centers,  in  parallel  with  the  increase  in  the  spatial  extent  of  the  electron  wavefunction 

- to Vn

(Table  2).  As  the  protons  in  the  water  molecules  acquire  their  isotropic  hyperfine  coupling 

constants  mainly  via  spin  bond  polarization  involving  the  unpaired  electron  in  these  O  2p

orbitals, 2 the increased spreading of the electron wavefunction reduces these hyperfine coupling 

constants  and,  correspondingly,  decreases  the  second  moment  M2  of  the  EPR  spectrum.  This 

effect provides tight limits on the acceptable structure for the electron trapping site. In particular, 
-, C-
the VD- center is eliminated by the unrealistically large M2 of 30 G2 whereas the extended Vn
,  and  I-  centers  yield  too  low  estimates  for  this  parameter  (Table  2).  The  best  match  for  the 
- 
- centers. The VDE for the VD- and VDn
observed second moment is provided by the V- and VDn

centers calculated using the DFT method is 1.55 and 0.9 eV, respectively (vs. 3.26 eV calculated 
for liquid water, which is in good agreement with the estimate of Coe et al. 13), i.e. the VD defect 
is a deep  electron trap in ice. The V- defect has much lower  VDE of 0.4 eV, whereas electron 

trapping  by  an  unperturbed  V  defect  is  thermoneutral.  Interestingly,  the  estimate  of  1.55  eV  is 

close to extrapolated (

ﬁn

) VDE for large (n=50-200) gas-phase isomer-II  (

)-
nOH 2

 clusters 

observed by Neumark and co-workers, 9,10  whereas 0.4 eV is close to the VDE extrapolated for 
isomer-III clusters.  9 Presently, these isomers are believed to trap the electrons at their surface; 

however,  our  calculations  point  to  the  possibility  that  the  electron  is  trapped  internally,  by  a 

defect site in an ice-like cluster. As the progenitor neutral custers are generated by expansion of 
water into vacuum, the state and the temperature of these clusters are not known well  9 and the 

formation of ice-like structures is possible. 

For other lattice defects in ice-Ih, VDE is positive, and such centers would spontaneously 

eject electrons back into the ice bulk. The energy of the quasifree electron in crystalline ice-Ih is 
not known; the best estimate for polycrystalline ice at 77 K is -0.36 eV,  37  which suggests the 
 transition in the infrared. That would be in agreement with experiment, 24

unrealistic  that  relaxation  of  this  electron  center,  which  requires  only  slight  movement  of  the 

three  OH  dangling  bonds,  would  take  tens  of  milliseconds.  Another  consideration  is  the 

availability  of  the  parent  point  defect:  while  there  is  much  evidence  for  the  existence  of  water 
vacancies in low temperature ice from positron annihilation spectroscopy, 39 the VD defect is still 
a hypothetical species lacking experimental demonstration. 20 Thus, we suggest that the “weakly 
bound  electron”  is  a  (quasifree)  31  electron  trapped  by  vacancy  centers  in  the  bulk.  Such 

vacancies  are  frozen  into  the  ice  lattice  as  the  solid  is  cooled  below  200  K.  An  intriguing 

possibility is that the “wb electrons” observed in the early stages of electron trapping/solvation in 
polar glasses (on the microsecond time scale)  16-18 and liquids (on the picosecond time scale)  19 

are  also  such  vacancy-trapped  electrons.  Rapid  molecular  dynamics  occurring  in  these  media 

quickly  eliminates  these  weakly  bound  states,  whereas  in  low-temperature  ice  such  centers 

persist over a long period of time.

Thermodynamics of magnetic materials is discussed in practical, lab-oriented terms. In

the common experimental configuration in which the external magnetic field comes from a
solenoidal coil connected to a power supply, magnetic work is identified unambiguously as the
flow of electromagnetic field energy from the power supply into the system via the connecting
wires. A simple algebraic expression is derived for the “magnetic energy” of microscopic dipoles
which interact with the magnetic fields produced by each other, by an external coil, or by a
permanent magnet. The discussion delineates the important distinction between induced
magnetic moments, which are diamagnetic, and permanent microscopic moments, which are
paramagnetic. The practicality of these ideas is illustrated by calculations of the magnetic
properties of several idealized magnetic solids via  minimization of the appropriate free energy.

1. Introduction.

50 years ago, Guggenheim[1] noted and attempted to dispel the confusion which he

perceived to surround magnetic work and thermodynamics of magnets. Through the intervening
decades many texts[e.g., 2-7] and articles[e.g., 8,9] have appeared with the same intention, yet
confusion persists. The goal of the present article is to distill  thermodynamics of magnets from
these works, gaining clarity at a minor cost in generality, and to provide example applications to
model systems, so that the subject could be included in a course on thermodynamics. Most
confusion centers on magnetic work, so we will begin with a common laboratory setup in which
magnetic work can be identified unambiguously. The next largest source of confusion is
magnetic energy, which is usually expressed as a volume integral involving magnetic fields
and/or magnetization. We will acknowledge that the important microscopic objects are dipoles,
do the necessary integrals analytically, and obtain a simple algebraic expression. Finally, we will
calculate the equilibrium properties of a variety of prototypical magnetic materials by minimizing
their free energies. MKS units are used throughout. µ0 ≡ 4π×10-7 H/m is the permeability of
vacuum.

2. The Lab, the System, and Magnetic Work.

Consider an ellipsoidal homogeneous sample which experiences the magnetic field, Be(r),

produced by a current flowing in an external coil. Be written without an explicit argument is the
field at the sample, assumed to be uniform over the sample and parallel to z. As shown in Fig. 1,
a coax carries current, i(t), to the coil from a power supply. A voltmeter reads the voltage, V(t),
across the coax. The x, y, and z axes coincide with the ellipsoidal axes, a, b, and c, of the sample.
If the sample is anisotropic, then the principle axes of its anisotropy coincide with a, b, and
c.[10] The sample is in contact with a thermal reservoir at T0 and a pressure reservoir at P0, e.g.,
a bath of liquid He, whose thermodynamic and magnetic properties are known.

Our thermodynamic system will include the sample and some portion of the energy in the

magnetic field. There is flexibility in the choice of magnetic field energy to include because the
static field has no entropy.[8] The best choice[2,9] is the extra magnetic field energy due to the
sample. For purposes of calculating it, which we do in Sec. 4, the closed surface that bounds the
system has linear dimensions many times larger than the largest dimension of the coil, and
therefore encloses essentially all of the magnetic field energy produced by the current in the
circuit as well as the field energy of each of the microscopic magnetic dipoles in the sample. The
surface is not so large that it includes the power supply and the voltmeter. The total magnetic
work done on the system by the power supply is the electromagnetic energy which flows, via
Poynting’s vector[11], into the system at the place where the coax intersects the surface. The
surface is chosen so that the integral of Poynting’s vector over the rest of the surface is

3

negligible. We want only the extra work done due to the presence of the sample, which
corresponds with our choice of magnetic energy.

The extra work done by the power supply in bringing the current from i to i + di in time

interval between t and t + dt can be expressed equally well in terms of current and voltage and in
terms of magnetic moment and external field. Let I(t) be the total magnetic moment of the
sample. Suppose that between t and t + dt, I changes by dI and the external field changes by dBe.
The total work done by the power supply is:[1-6] ∫dV d[Be
2(r)/2µ0] + Be(t)·dI + i2Rdt, where R
is the resistance of the circuit. The extra work due to the sample is clearly Be(t)·dI. The total
work also is dt times the integral of Poynting’s vector over the surface of the system, i.e., the
piece of surface lying inside the coax. It is elementary to show that the integral equals V(t) i(t)dt.
The result is general, and not restricted to coaxial cables. The extra work done on the system
when the sample is present is then: ∆V(t) i(t)dt, where ∆V(t) is the extra voltage.

It is useful to examine how Iz vs. Be is determined from V(t) vs. i(t) in the following

gedanken experiment. With the sample absent, Be is measured at the sample position as a
function of i. Then i(t) is ramped slowly 100 times from 0 to a maximum value while V(t) is
measured. The 100 voltage ramps are averaged to provide an empty-coil baseline, <V(t)> vs. t.
Variations of each empty-coil run about the average measure noise in the apparatus. The sample
is introduced with its ellipsoidal c axis parallel to Be. V(t) is measured continuously for 100 more
identical current ramps. By Faraday’s law applied to the series circuit of voltmeter-coax-coil, the
voltmeter voltage, V(t), is i(t)R plus the rate of change of magnetic flux linking the circuit, which
is dominated by the flux linking the coil. Subtracting the baseline average, <V(t)>, from each of
the V(t) ramps taken with the sample present removes the voltage due to the resistance and self-
inductance of the coil and leaves only the extra voltage, ∆V(t), due to the extra magnetic flux
linked into the circuit by the magnetic moment of the sample.

The extra work done between t’ and t’ + dt’ can be expressed as Be(t’)dIz or as
∆V(t’)i(t’)dt’. Iz(t) for the j’th ramp can be found by integrating measured quantities:

We will assume nonhysteretic samples, so Iz,j(0) = 0. The equilibrium moment, <Iz> vs. Be at
fixed external temperature and pressure is obtained from Eq. (1) with the ensemble average,
<∆V(t)>, replacing ∆Vj(t). Fluctuations about the average, i.e., <[Iz,j(t) - <Iz(t)>]2>, after
correction for noise in the apparatus, measure thermal fluctuations in Iz.

4

There are other, more precise ways to measure Iz. [See, for example, refs. 12, 13.] If the

magnetic field should be produced by a permanent magnet instead of a coil, then we would
consider the permanent magnet to be inside the surface which bounds the system so that
Poynting’s vector is essentially zero over the surface, and no electromagnetic work is ever done.
It is still possible for work to be done on the system by the pressure reservoir or by an external
agent which moves the sample.

3. Energy, Entropy, and Minimization of Free Energy.

One of the chief utilities of thermodynamics in magnetism is that it permits simple
calculations of the equilibrium properties of model systems via maximization of total entropy, S
+ S0, of system plus thermal reservoir, thereby providing an alternative viewpoint to quantum
statistical mechanical calculations. To develop the necessary formalism, we begin by equating
the energy gained by the system to the energy lost by reservoirs during an interval ∆t. We assume
that the number of moles of each chemical species is constant and suppress mole numbers. Let U
be the energy of the system, including the extra magnetic field energy and the kinetic and
potential energies of the particles in the sample. Let V be the volume of the sample and V0 be the
volume of the pressure reservoir. Assume that the total volume, V0 + V, is fixed. Finally, let ∆Q
represent a small heat transfer from the heat reservoir into the system. For a general change in the
system in a small time interval, ∆t, conservation of energy requires:

∆U = ∆Q + P0∆V0 + V(t)i(t)dt

= ∆Q - P0∆V + Be∆Iz.

(2)

The second equality relies on: ∆V0 = -∆V and V(t)i(t)dt = Be(t)∆Iz.

Now we introduce entropy and its relationship to heat flow and temperature by replacing

∆Q with -T0∆S0 in Eq. (2). The condition of maximum entropy requires that for a system near
equilibrium, d(S + S0) ≤ 0 for any combination of small changes, “dXi”, in unconstrained system
variables, Xi. The trick is to identify the unconstrained variables. If, for example, we considered a
crystalline solid containing permanent microscopic moments distributed on two inequivalent
sites, “A” and “B”, and one type of induced diamagnetic moment, then we would express ∆Iz in
Eq. (2) as ∆IA,p,z + ∆IB,p,z + ∆Id,z. For such a system, maximization of entropy leads in the usual
way to:

d[U – T0S + P0V - Be(IA,p,z + IB,p,z + Id,z)] ≥ 0,

(3)

for fixed T0, P0, and Be. Thus, the “free energy” to be minimized is:

5

G0 ≡ U – T0S + P0V - Be(IA,p,z + IB,p,z + Id,z).

(4)

A subtlety here is that the net diamagnetic moment, Id,z, is not an unconstrained variable. It is the
ineluctable response of core and valence electrons to the magnetic field felt by an atom, and it is
a function of U, V, the paramagnetic moments, and Be. S is a function of the same variables. This
quirk confounds efforts to fit diamagnetism into a thermodynamic formalism which begins with
the premise that S can be written a function of extensive system variables only.[14] Fortunately,
the Gibbs free energy is still a perfectly well defined thermodynamic function of intensive
variables, as is shown in the examples.

4. Magnetic Energy.

We now calculate the magnetic energy of permanent and induced magnetic dipole

moments. This includes the change in internal energy of each dipole caused by the field that it
feels, the self-field energy of each dipole, and the extra field energy due to the overlap of the
dipole fields with each other and with the applied magnetic field. The integrals can be done
analytically because all fields are divergenceless and integrals are effectively over all space. We
will calculate the magnetic energy for the two interesting cases where the external field is
produced by a coil or by a nearby permanent magnet. In both cases the field is assumed to be
uniform over the sample and parallel to z.

The extra energy in the magnetic field is:

(5)

The total field at r is Be(r) plus the field due to each dipole, µµµµj, in the sample. There are 3 types
of terms in Eq. (5). The extra field energy due to overlap of external field and dipole fields is:

µ0

-1∫dV Be(r) · [Bdip1(r) + Bdip2(r) + …] = Be·(µµµµ1 + µµµµ2 + …).

(6)

The field energy due to overlap of the fields of, e.g., dipoles 1 and 2 is:

µ0

-1∫dV Bdip1(r)·Bdip2(r) = Bdip1(r2)·µµµµ2 = Bdip2(r1)·µµµµ1.

(7)

The self-field energy of a dipole is: ∫dV Bdipj(r)2/2µ0.

If we can neglect diamagnetism, so that all microscopic dipoles are permanent, then the
magnetic energy is particularly simple. The self-field energy is constant and is absorbed into the

6

rest mass energy. The field from a coil changes the internal energy of each dipole by -Be·µµµµ,
which cancels against the field energy in Eq. (6). Dipole 1 changes the internal energy of dipole 2
by: -Bdip1(r2)·µµµµ2, and vice versa. Because Bdip1(r2)·µµµµ2 = Bdip2(r1)·µµµµ1, the net interaction between
two permanent dipoles can be written as -Bdip1(r2)·µµµµ2 or -Bdip2(r1)·µµµµ1. If both dipoles are in the
sample, we assign half to each one. If one is in the sample and one is in a permanent magnet
nearby, then we assign all of the energy to the one in the sample. The net magnetic energy of a
permanent dipole µµµµj is:

Uj,mag = -µµµµj·[Bloc(rj)/2 + Bpm], 

where Bloc(rj) is the field at rj due to all other permanent moments in the sample and Bpm(rj) is
the field from dipoles in the permanent magnet. Typically, Bpm is uniform over the sample. If, in
addition, all of the moments occupy equivalent sites, the average local field is the same for all,
and summing over all moments yields a total energy:

Up,mag = -(Bloc/2 + Bpm)·Ip,

where Ip is the net dipole moment of the sample.

When induced dipoles are included, the situation is a little more involved. The self-field
energy of induced dipoles is typically so small that it is neglected without comment.[e.g., 15-17]
We lump it with the internal magnetic energy of the atom or molecule. The internal “magnetic
energy” associated with diamagnetism of an atom or molecule is actually the field-induced
change in kinetic and Coulomb potential energy of the electrons, which, in a calculation, traces
back to the vector potential in the kinetic energy operator. Classically, it comes from the change
in electron orbits due to the electric field that is induced, via Faraday’s Law, when the external
magnetic field changes. The magnetic energy of the dipole, ∆E, including the change, ∆Eint, in its
internal energy and the field energy, µµµµd·Be, [Eq. (6)] is proportional to Be
The magnetic susceptibility of a single atom or molecule is best defined[18] as:

2 for a linear system.

The magnetic moment is: µµµµd = χd,molBe/µ0, so we can write the magnetic energy as:

χd,mol ≡ ∆E /(Be

2/2µ0).

∆E  = µµµµd ·Be/2,

and the internal energy as:

∆Eint  = -µµµµd ·Be/2.

(12)

7

In general, χd,mol is a tensor. For closed-shell atoms, χd,mol ranges from about –1 to -50×10-6
cm3/mole.[18] The minus sign in Faraday’s Law ensures diamagnetism, µµµµd·Be < 0. In a solid
composed of these molecules, χd,mol may be a function of V.

Deduction of the diamagnetic moment of a single molecule from ∆E vs. Be follows from

conservation of energy. When the field is turned on slowly, the extra work done by the power
supply must remain in the system because there is no radiation and no other particle to take
energy away. The extra work is 0∫I Be(I’)dI’, where the total moment, I’, is just the single
moment, µd. If µd is strictly proportional to field, i.e., µd = χd,molBe/µ0, then the extra work is
∫µ0(µd’/χd,mol)dµd’ = µ0µd

2/2µ0. Thus, we have Eq. (10) relating ∆E to χd,mol.

2/2χd,mol = χd,molBe

The total field experienced by diamagnetic dipole j includes the net field, Bloc(rj), from
other dipoles in the sample and the field, Bpm, from the dipoles in a permanent magnet, so µµµµj =
χd,mol[Be + Bloc(r1) + Bpm]. We assign to dipole j the change in its internal energy, -µµµµj·[Be +
Bloc(rj) + Bpm]/2, the field energy, µµµµj·Be, half of the dipole-dipole field energy, µµµµj·Bloc(rj)/2,
involving other dipoles in the sample, and all of the field energy, µµµµj·Bpm, involving dipoles in the
permanent magnet. Finally, we assign to each diamagnetic moment the change which its field
induces in the internal energy of the permanent dipole moments in the permanent magnet, which
we write as: -µµµµj·Bpm. The net magnetic energy of each induced dipole in the sample is:

Summing over all induced dipoles, assumed to be equivalent, the magnetic energy assigned to the
total dipole moment, Id, is:

Ud,j = ½ µµµµj·(Be - Bpm).

Ud = ½ Id·(Be - Bpm).

We assign to permanent magnetic dipole, k, the change in its internal energy, -µµµµk·[Be +

Bloc(rk) + Bpm], the interaction field energy, µµµµk·[Be + Bloc(rk)/2 + Bpm], and the change in internal
energy that the field of dipole k induces in the dipoles in the permanent magnet, -µµµµk·Bpm,
following the same prescription as for induced dipoles. The net magnetic energy of permanent
dipole k is:

If all permanent moments occupy equivalent sites, then summing over them yields their magnetic
energy:

Up,k =  -µµµµk·[Bloc(rk)/2 + Bpm]. 

Up = -Ip·(Bloc,p/2 + Bpm),

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

8

in terms of the average local field, Bloc,p, that they feel and their net dipole moment, Ip. It is easy
to generalize to two or more inequivalent sites.

The absence of Be from Eq. (15) looks suspicious, but it is what permits paramagnetic

moments to fluctuate independently of the energy of the system. Moreover, it is consistent with
conservation of energy. Consider the energy of a single isolated permanent moment, µµµµ, while the
field from a coil is turned on. The foregoing argues that its energy does not change, requiring that
the power supply does no extra work. Let us see. When the field is increased slowly, quantum
mechanics tells us that µµµµ precesses ever more rapidly about Be, but its projection along Be doesn’t
change. Hence, ∆Iz = ∆µz = 0, and the power supply does no extra work. Now consider what
happens when µz changes in fixed field due to a collision with a passing particle. The power
supply does work, Be∆µz, while the extra magnetic field energy, Beµz, increases by ∆(Beµz) =
Be∆µz, conserving energy. The scattering event conserves energy separately. The internal energy
of the moment decreases by ∆(Beµz) = Be∆µz, while the kinetic energy of the scattering particle
increases by the same amount.

5. Equivalence between a Coil and a Permanent Magnet.

If the external field is produced by a coil, then the free energy, G0, contains a “Legendre”
term, -Be(µd,z + µp,z), for each dipole in the sample. Combining this with the magnetic energies of
induced and permanent microscopic dipoles, Eqs. (13) and (15) with  Bpm = 0, yields a net
contribution to G0 of: -µd,zBe /2 - µp,zBloc,p/2 - µp,zBe. If the field is produced by a permanent
magnet, we take the magnet to reside inside of the surface which bounds the system, discussed in
Sec. 2. No magnetic work is done on the system, so there is no Legendre term. With Be = 0, the
net magnetic energy contribution to G0 is the same as it is with a coil, but with Bpm in place of Be.
Thus, in statistical mechanics, the probability of a permanent moment having a particular z
component, µp,z, contains a factor, exp[-µp,zBext], where Bext is the external field, without
reference to the source of the field. If the local field, Bloc, is obtained in a mean-field theory, then
the probability contains an additional factor, exp[-µp,zBloc/2], not the naively-expected factor,
exp[-µp,zBloc].

6. Diamagnets.

6.A. Diamagnetic Susceptibility.

Consider a solid composed of identical diamagnetic atoms at low temperatures. Id is
calculated from the magnetic susceptibility of each atom and the field that it feels. Let us assume
that each atom sits at a site of cubic symmetry, so the average local field due to atoms within a
sphere centered on each atom vanishes. The local field due to atoms outside of the sphere is the
average field inside a uniformly magnetized ellipsoid, (the full sample), minus the field inside a

9

uniformly magnetized sphere. With demagnetization factors[19] of 1/3 for a sphere and ηz for the
sample,

Bloc,z/µ0 = [(1 - ηz) - (1 - 1/3)] Mz = (1/3 - ηz) Id,z/V.

The magnetization, Mz ≡ Id,z/V, is:

Mz = NNAχd,mol(Be + Bloc,z)/Vµ0.

NA is Avogadro’s number. By using Eq. (18) in Eq. (17), we can solve for Id,z and obtain the
susceptibility, χD ≡ µ0Mz/Be:

1/χD = 1/χD,0 - 1/3 + ηz,

where the “bare” susceptibility is:

χD,0 ≡ NNAχd,mol/V.

1/χD,conv = 1/χD,0 - 1/3,

Umag = VχDBe

2/2µ0.

The conventional susceptibility is defined as Mz/Hin,z, where Hin ≡ Bin/µ0 - M. In the present case,
Hin,z = Be/µ0 - ηzId,z/V. Replacing Be/µ0 by Hin,z + ηzId,z/V in Eq. (18) yields:

which is independent of sample shape. Finally, the magnetic energy is [Eq.(14)]:

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

6.B. Magnetostriction and Thermal Expansion.

For this example, we examine the origins of magnetostriction and thermal expansion. We

add to G0 the Helmholtz free energy, Ucoh + Uph - TphSph, of the lattice. Ucoh is the cohesive
energy of the solid at T = 0, Be = 0, P = 0, and V = Nv0, relative to neutral atoms far apart. If κ is
the compressibility of the unmagnetized lattice at T = 0, then:

Ucoh. ≈ Nucoh.(V = Nv0) + [Nv0 - V - V"n(Nv0/V)]/κ

≈ Nucoh.(V = Nv0) + Nv0(1 - V/Nv0)2/2κ.

(23)

10

Assuming a typical phonon heat capacity[20], Cph(Tph, V) ≈ ANR(6Tph/θD)3, where θD(V) is the
volume-dependent Debye temperature, R is the gas constant, and A ≈ 1, integration of dUph =
Cph(T’)dT’ and dSph = Cph(T’)dT’/T’ from 0 to Tph yields:

Uph - T0Sph = ANR(6Tph/θD)3 [Tph/4 - T0/3].

(24)

Therefore,

G0 =  χDVBe

2/2µ0 + ANR(6Tph/θD)3 [Tph/4 - T0/3]

+ Nucoh.(V = Nv0) + Nv0(1 - V/Nv0)2/2κ + P0V.

(25)

Minimizing G0 wrt Tph at fixed V, N, P0, Be and T0 yields: <Tph> = T0, so we neglect

subscripts and replace T0 and Tph by T in Eq. (25). Similarly, we drop the subscript on P0,
dropping any distinction between the “external pressure” and the “pressure”. The second term in
G0 becomes: -18ANRT4/θD(V)3. Minimizing G0 wrt. V yields the equilibrium volume, <V>:

<V>/Nv0 ≈ 1 - κ[P + ∂(χDV)/∂V|T,Be Be

2/2µ0 - 54γART4/v0θD

3]

/[1 + 54κγART4/v0θD

3]. 

(26)

We have used θD(V) ∝ V-γ
, (the Gruneisen parameter, γ ≈ 1 [21]), so that dθD/dV = -γθD/V. If we
evaluate θD and ∂(χDV)/∂V|T,Be at V = Nv0, Eq. (26) is an explicit expression for the equilibrium
volume in terms of P, T, and Be. We see that magnetostriction and thermal expansion come from
the volume dependencies of the molecular susceptibility, χd,mol, [Eq.(10)] and the phonon heat
capacity, respectively.

Finally, the equilibrium Gibbs free energy is:

G(T,P,Be,N) = (P - χDBe

2/2µ0)V – Cph(T,V)T/12 + Nucoh(P = 0,T = 0)

+ Nv0[P + ∂(χDV)/∂V|T,Be Be

2/2µ0 - 54γART4/v0θD

3]2/2[1 + 54κγART4/v0θD

3]2,

(27)

where V is understood to be the function of T, P, Be, and N given as <V> in Eq. (26). The
derivatives of G wrt -T, P, and -Be are the equilibrium entropy, volume, and total magnetic
moment, as expected for G ≡ U – TS + PV - BeIz, with dU = TdS – PdV + BedIz. Thus, G is the
usual Gibbs free energy.

7. Ferromagnets and Antiferromagnets.

11

Now consider a crystalline solid in which each atom has a permanent magnetic dipole
moment, µµµµ. Ignore diamagnetism. Let all N atoms occupy equivalent sites of cubic symmetry.
The local field is given by Eq. (17), with Ip,z replacing Id,z, and the net magnetic energy [Eq. (16)]
is:

Up = -Ip,z Bloc,z/2 = -µ0(1/3 - ηz)Ip,z

2 /2V.

Nonmagnetic interactions among localized permanent moments are the focus of a great deal of
research on magnetism. Pairwise interactions generally dominate and the nonmagnetic energy is
approximately quadratic:

(28)

(29)

Unonmag = - NaIp,z

2/2I0

2.

I0 = NNAµ is the total moment when all dipoles are parallel. a is the part of the interaction
between one atom and its neighbors which depends on the relative orientation of their dipole
moments. In general, a depends on the overlap of atomic orbitals, hence on V, leading to
magnetostriction as in the previous section. Let us assume that entropy of the permanent
moments is largest in the unpolarized state and can be represented by a Taylor expansion for
small polarizations, Ip,z/I0 « 1:

Sp/NkB ≈ s0 - c(Ip,z/I0)2/2 - e(Ip,z/I0)4/12.

(30)

s0, c and e are positive constants of order unity. They take the values: s0 = ln2, and c = e = 1, for
weakly-interacting spin-1/2 systems. The fact that the temperature of the subsystem of permanent
moments is zero, by its usual definition as the derivative of Sp wrt energy with extensive
variables V and Ip,z fixed, highlights the difficulty in applying the entropy-based formalism to
magnetic systems. To proceed, let us simplify the algebra by taking V to be fixed. Conceding that
<Tph> = T0 and replacing both by T, defining the atomic density, n ≡ N/V, and saturation
magnetization, Msat ≡ I0/V, G0 becomes:

G0/V = -µ0(1/3 - ηz)Mz

(31)

If a > 0 and the sample is elongated along z, (ηz < 1/3), favoring ferromagnetism along z, this has
the classic Ginzburg-Landau form for a weakly polarized, Mz « Msat, homogeneous
ferromagnet[4]:

G0/V = µ0Mz

α ≡ n(ckBT - a)/µ0Msat

2,

and

β ≡ enRT/3µ0Msat

4.

Minimization of G0/V wrt Mz at fixed V and T shows that χp is indeed the magnetic
susceptibility at high temperature, and that 1/χp becomes negative and a spontaneous moment
forms when T drops below the Curie temperature, TC ≡ [a + (µ0Msat

2/n)(1/3 - ηz)]/ckB.

Antiferromagnetism arises when a < 0, as follows. Suppose that nonmagnetic interactions
beyond nearest neighbor are negligible. Consider N moments of the same size to be of two types,
“A” and “B”, which reside on interpenetrating cubic lattices. The nearest neighbors of A’s are
B’s and vice versa. The local field for both is Bloc,z = µ0(1/3 - ηz)(MA,z + MB,z). The nonmagnetic
energy is: Unonmag ≈ N|a|IA,zIB,z/2(I0/2)2. The magnetic entropy is the sum of the entropies of the A
and B subsystems. Thus,

Minimize G0/V wrt MA,z and MB,z separately to find equations for <MA,z> and <MB,z>:

At high T and small fields, cubic terms are negligible. There is a symmetric solution,

<MA,z> = <MB,z> = Be/2[n|a|Msat

-2 + 2cnkBTMsat

-2 - µ0(1/3 - ηz)],

(39)

and an antisymmetric solution,

<MA,z> = -<MB,z> = ± Be/[4cnkBTMsat

-2 - 2n|a|Msat

which diverges at the Neel temperature: TN ≡ |a|/2ckB. The symmetric solution minimizes G0/V
for T > TN, and we find the usual result for the susceptibility, χAF ≡ µ0Mz/Be:

1/χAF = 1/χAF,0 - 1/3 + ηz,

where,

1/χAF,0 = (|a| + 2ckBT)nMsat

For T < TN and Be = 0, the cubic terms must be included, and G0/V is minimized by the
antisymmetric solution,

<MA,z>/Msat = -<MB,z>/Msat =  ±(3cTN/2eT)1/2(1 - T/TN)1/2,

(43)

which describes spontaneous antiferromagnetic ordering.

8.  Pauli Susceptibility of Conduction Electrons.

The conduction electrons in a metal make an interesting contrast to antiferromagnetism

because the permanent dipoles come in two types, “up” and “down”, but they are mobile, and the
number of dipoles of each type is not fixed. The physics of a degenerate gas of conduction
electrons is discussed in any text on solid state physics. We consider that the magnetic-moment-
up and magnetic-moment-down conduction electrons form distinct subsystems, each with its own
chemical potential, energy, entropy, temperature, and magnetic moment. They share the same
volume, V. The total number of electrons is fixed, so the chemical potentials of “ups” and
“downs” are not independent.

The simplest approximation is to take the density of states per unit volume, N(E), to be

independent of electron energy, to take V to be fixed, and to consider T = 0. In this case, the total
density n of electrons is related to the chemical potentials, µup and µdown, by:

n = N(0)(µup + µdown).

If µup should change by δµup, then µdown would have to change by -δµup so that n is constant. The
net magnetization is the electron moment, µB, times the excess density of ups over downs:

Mz = N(0)µB(δµup - δµdown) = N(0)µB2δµup.

Converting downs to ups increases the kinetic energy density by:

Ukin/V = N(0)δµup

2 = Mz

2/4N(0)µB

Taking the effective local field to be the average field inside the metal, because the electrons are
mobile, Bloc,z = µ0(1 - ηz)Mz, the magnetic energy density of the electrons is[Eq. (16)]:

Umag/V = -µ0(1 - ηz)Mz

2/2.

Finally, the free energy to be minimized is:

G0/V = [1/2N(0)µB

2 - µ0(1 - ηz)]Mz

2/2 - BeMz + nonmag. terms.

(48)

Minimizing G0/V wrt Mz at fixed V yields the Pauli susceptibility, χP ≡ µ0Mz/Be:

1/χP = 1/2N(0)µ0µB

2 - 1 + ηz.

1/χP is typically about 105, so the local field correction is negligible. The reader is invited to
repeat the calculation including the energy dependence of the density of states, the Coulomb
interaction between electrons, and nonzero temperature.

9. Conclusion.

The formalism developed in this paper is general enough to cover any practical magnetic
material. Extending it to include superconductors is straightforward but too involved to include
here. Finally, it is possible to use the same approach to produce a simple formalism for
thermodynamics of dielectric and paraelectric materials located between the plates of a parallel-
plate capacitor.

can prove that the magnetic susceptibility is positive. Clearly this mistreats diamagnets.

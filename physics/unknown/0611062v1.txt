We  present  a  photon  counting  experiment  designed  for  an  undergraduate  physics 
laboratory. The statistics of the number of photons of a pseudo thermal light source 
is  studied  in  two  limiting  cases:  well  above  and  well  below  the  coherence  time, 
giving Poisson and Bose-Einstein distributions, respectively. We show that using a 
digital oscilloscope the experiment can be done in a reasonable time, without need 
of  counting  boards.  The  use  of  the  oscilloscope  has  the  additional  advantage  of 
allowing the storage of the data for further processing. Hence, using the same set of 
data, the analysis of the statistics of the occurrence of n photons as a function of the 
time  windows  adds important  evidence  to  determine  accurately  the  nature  of  the 
light source.  The stochastic  nature of the  detection  phenomena  adds an  additional 
value  to  this  type  of  experiments,  since  the  student  is  forced  to  a  thorough  visit 
through data processing and statistics.

1. Introduction

In  a  typical  photon  counting  experiment,  a  photomultiplier (PMT)  is  used  to 
convert  light  in  electrons  which  are  amplified  into electrical  pulses  and  sent  to  a 
counting electronics. In a very dim illumination scheme, each pulse is assigned to
one  single  photon  reaching  the  photocathode  and  works  out  as  a  count.    By 
computing a large number of counts, the statistics of the number of photons per unit 
time  can  be recorded,  giving  valuable  information  about  the  nature  of  the  light
source1. It is commonly believed that a good photon counting experiment needs to 
be done with a rather sophisticated counting electronics, including a fast amplifier 
and  a  counting  board.  That  is  true  and  certainly  accessible  for  a  standard 
experiment in a research lab; however, we demonstrate in this paper that the same 
results  can  be  achieved  with  modest  undergraduate  lab  equipment.  Moreover,  we 
show  that  an  additional  analysis  of  the  data  achieved  with  this  scheme adds  new
experimental evidence to the actual statistics and it also contributes to the learning 
process  desired  in  an  undergraduate  lab  project.  The  counting  electronics  is 
replaced  by  a  digital  oscilloscope,  which  records  the  time  traces  out  of  the 
photomultiplier  at  a  given  selected  time  window.  Each  of  those  windows  is

1

acquired trough the serial port of a personal computer. We show in this paper that 
computing  the  probability  of  counting  n  photons  vs.  the  time  windows  gives  a 
signature that helps to decide the proper statistics which describe each light source 
studied. Moreover,  once  the  information  is  stored  in  the  computer,  it  can  be 
analyzed  in  different  manners,  allowing  a  deeper  understanding  of  statistics, 
correlation  and  data  processing,  by  comparing  the  complementary  aspects  of  the 
information  gathered  by  the  different  analyses.  In  this  sense,  one  of  the  most 
interesting  advantages  of  measuring  the  time  traces  of  the  photon  detection 
experiment  is  the possibility of measuring  the statistical  distribution  of the arrival 
time  of  photons.  This  measurement  brings  additional  information  useful  to 
distinguish between light sources with Bose-Einstein and Poisson statistics.

The experiment will be fully described in Section 3. The general idea is to study the
photon counting statistics of a pseudo-thermal light source in two limiting regimes, 
above  and  below  the  coherence  time,  which  is,  to  some  extent,  controlled  by  the 
experimenter. The aim of the project is twofold, to illustrate the stochastic nature of 
the  photodetection  itself  and  the  statistics  of  the  thermal  light  in  very  different 
regimes. Both contributions will be present in the photon counting measurements.

2. Photon counting statistics

In this  Section we  give a short description of the  theory needed for  analyzing the 
counting statistics in our experiment. For a longer discussion there are many books 
in  the field (see for instance)2.  A photon  counting  experiment consists  of a large 
number of measurements of the number of counts,  m, in a given time window, T. 
The  calculations  should  give  us  an  analytical  expression  for  the  probability 
distribution 
 for the occurrence of m counts in the time interval T. Within the 
semiclassical  theory  of  the  optical  detection,  the  electromagnetic  field  is  treated 
classically, and the PMT converts a classical continuous intensity  I  in a succession 
of  discrete  counts.  With  the  assumption  that  the  probability  p(t) per  unit  time  of 
having  a  single  count  at  time  t  is  proportional  to  the  intensity 
,  the  so  called 
Mandel Formula can be obtained 2,3,4:

of a time dependent function, but for the two cases studied here we can find simple 
expressions. Let us define the characteristic time of the intensity fluctuations as the 
coherence time of the light source, Tc. If the window time T is much longer than the 
coherence time Tc, then the average in  Eq. (1)  gives the long-average intensity in 
the  observation  time  T.  Therefore,  the  behavior  of  a  thermal  light  within  this 
condition is equivalent to the behavior of a stable wave with a fixed intensity (like a 
laser light source). The result after Eq. (1) is a Poisson distribution:

time  is  much  shorter  than  the  coherence  time  (T<<Tc),  the  average  is  almost  the

The arrival time probability Pat(T) is the probability of measuring two consecutive 
photocounts with a time delay T. This probability can be computed as the product 
of  two  probabilities,  i.e.  the  probability of  counting  0  photons  within  the  interval 
[t,t+T]  multiplied  by  the  probability  of  counting  1  photon  at  time  t+T.  After  a 
statistical  average  over  the  fluctuations  of  the  intensity  this  probability  can  be 
expressed as:

So  far,  we  have  obtained  the  behavior  of  a  thermal  source  in  two  extreme  cases. 
However,  it  is  experimentally  almost  impossible  to  work  with  real  thermal  light 
sources in the condition T<<Tc, since the coherence time of those kinds of sources 
is  well  below  10-8 s.  For  this  reason  we  built  a  pseudo-thermal  light  source,  in 
which the coherence time Tc can be chosen in order to fulfill conditions of Eqs. (2)
and (4). In Section 3 the experimental set up will be described. 

3. Experimental

A  stable  high  voltage  (HV)  source  at  -1200  V  feeds  the  photomultiplier  (PMT, 
Hamamatsu  1P28).  The  current  signal  built  in  the  PMT  passes  through  a  load 
resistor, RL, and the voltage drop on it is recorded by the oscilloscope. The digital 
oscilloscope Tektronix TDS 360 (200 MHz bandwidth, and 1000 acquisition points 
per screen) is set at a given window time T, and each individual window is acquired 
trough the RS232  port of a personal  computer.  A program provided by  Tektronix 
was slightly modified to  continuously acquire the  time  windows. Simple  codes in 
FORTRAN language were written in order to extract the needed information as the 
number of peaks, peak height, etc. Using faster ports the data can be downloaded 
more  efficiently,  allowing  shorter  experiments,  but  it  must  be  stressed  that  even 
with our slow port enough statistics can be gathered in a reasonable teaching class. 

A pseudo thermal light source is generated using the experimental setup shown in 
Fig. 1, following the scheme of Reference3. The coherent light of a He-Ne laser is 
passed  trough  a  defusing  acrylic  disc,  which  can  rotate  at  a  selectable  speed.  A 
short  focus  lens (L)  before  the  disc  helps  to  produce  a  speckle  pattern  diverging 
away from it, which can be observed with the disc still. When the disc moves, the 
spatial coherence of the pattern is broken at a fixed observation point. Therefore, by 
selecting  the  speed  of  rotation  of  the  disc,  the  coherence  time  Tc  of  the  pseudo 
thermal light can be chosen1.

A pinhole (PH) attached to the PMT helps to reduce undesirable counts from other 
sources and keeps the counts low enough to be in a photon counting condition. The 
size of the pinhole was chosen smaller than the speckle grain characteristic size so 
that  the  intensity  fluctuations  could  eventually  reach  the  zero.  A  mirror  (M)  just 
before  the  disc  allows  directing  the  desired  portion  of  the  speckle  pattern  to  the 
PMT. Special care was taken to protect the PMT from residual ambient light with a 
sealed box, having only a small hole to allow the entrance of the desired light.

4. Results and discussion

4 A. Characterization of the intensity fluctuations

The goal of the experiment is to measure the statistics of the number of photons per 
unit time T of a pseudo thermal light in two different regimes: below and above the 
coherence  time  Tc.  As  stated  in  Section  2,  Bose-Einstein  statistics  should  be 
observed  if  T  <<  Tc  and  Poisson  statistics  if  T >> Tc. To  measure  the  light 
intensity fluctuations of the pseudo thermal light and, hence, Tc, we used the same 
setup shown in Fig. 1, but with the PMT used as an intensity photodetector. For this 
purpose, the PMT output signal is connected directly to the oscilloscope, so that the 
input high oscilloscope impedance acts as the load resistor giving a long integration 
time. Fig. 2 is a typical time trace showing the intensity fluctuations of our pseudo 
thermal light, for which the angular frequency of the disc is set at =25 mHz. For 
this experiment we acquired 103 windows of T=1s and the statistics of intensities 
has  been  recorded. As  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  3,  the  average  intensity fluctuations 
behave  as  predicted  by  Eq.  (3)  for  thermal  light:  a  negative  exponential  with  the 
highest  probability  at  zero  intensity.  In  order  to  extract Tc,  the  Fast  Fourier 

5

Transform (FFT) of each one of the windows was computed. A histogram with the 
occurrence  of  frequencies  for  all  the  windows  (not  shown)  gives  a  bell-shaped
distribution  peaked at a frequency, which is  the  inverse of Tc. This  experiment  is 
useful to know the Tc range that can be attained with a given experimental setup.
For our setup we obtain  Tc = 410-4/,  giving a  range of 7 s < Tc < 17 ms, for 
appropriate speeds of rotation of the disc.

4 B. Counting photons

The  PMT gain,  which  depends  on  the  bias  voltage  HV,  defines  the  pulse peak 
voltage,  which  can  be  estimated  from  the  datasheet  of  the  PMT.  However,  the 
stochastic  process  of  generation  of  secondary  electrons  inside  the  PMT  gives  a 
Poisson  distribution  of  the  peak  voltages.  A  typical  screen  of  the  oscilloscope  in 
photon counting mode, with RL=50 and T= 2s, is shown in Fig. 4(a). Each peak 
in  the  screen  corresponds  to  either  a  photon  reaching  the  photocathode  or  to  a 
spurious  noise  peak.  In  order  to  choose  a  threshold,  above  which  a  pulse  will  be 
counted  as  a  photon-count,  we  plot  the  peak  height  histogram,  as  shown  in  Fig. 
4(b).  It  is  clear  that  the  peak  pulses  distribution  is  separated  from  the  noise 
contribution, which is huge for low voltages.

4 C. Bose-Einstein and Poisson Statistics

We  have  performed  two  experiments  in  order  to  explore  the  two  statistical 
behaviors: Experiment I was designed to study the Bose-Einstein regime (BE) and 
Experiment  II  the  Poisson  (PS)  regime.  Using  the  same  pseudo thermal  light 
source, we  chose  different  experimental  parameters  for  each  Experiment,  as
indicated in Table 1. The highest Tc available was used for BE and the smallest Tc
for PS experiments.

The time windows T for each experiment were chosen to fulfill the corresponding 
conditions.  Due  to  the  finite  size  of  the  oscilloscope  register,  the  time  window 
choice  determines  the  time  resolution  of  the  experiment.  In  order  to  sample  the 
electrical pulses, corresponding to one photon, with  at least 2 points, the width of 
the pulse had to be adjusted according to the time windows. The shape and width of 
the pulses are defined by the building time of the PMT (~ 5ns), the load resistor, RL
, and the load and cable capacitance. We have selected the RL values in Table 1 to 
control  the  width  of  the  pulses  in  each  experiment.  Fig. 5(a)  and  (b)  depict  the 
typical shape of the pulses in experiment I and II respectively. In both experiments,
the  beam  intensity  was  controlled  in  order  to  maintain  low  enough  the  average 
number of photons per unit time and avoid the superposition of pulses.

mostly  separated  from  photocounts  peaks  allowing  the  definition  of  an  appropriate 
threshold.

Figs. 6(a) and (b) show the histogram of the number of photons recorded in BE and 
PS conditions, respectively. The average number of photons <m>, in each case can 
be  gained  from  the  Figs.  6,  and  corresponds  to  1.6  photon/sec  in  BE  and  18.4 
photons/msec in PS. The error bars in the figure were estimated taking into account 

8

the dark noise for this PMT (measured dark noise: 800 photons/sec), the arrival of 
spurious light and the statistical fluctuations.

As  can  be  seen  from  Figs.  6(a)  and  6(b),  the  experiment  fits  accurately  with  the 
predictions of Eqs. (4) and (2) respectively. The first examination of the quality of 
the  fit  is  made  by  applying  the  2  test,  giving  a  confidence  of  90%  for  the  BE 
experiment and 70% for the PS case. The number of time windows considered was 
10000  for  Experiment  I  and  6000  for  Experiment  II. The  reason  for  the  lower 
confidence in the PS case is not fully understood. One reason can be that, due to the
experimental  constrains,  we  could  not  fully  achieve  the  condition  T  >>  Tc.
Nevertheless, a sub-estimation of the error bars would produce a worse confidence. 
Although,  the  fitting  is  good  enough  to  decide for  one  or  the  other  statistics,  it  is 
better to  perform additional tests  in  order to  gain  confidence in  the interpretation. 
By measuring the time traces of the photon detection process with the oscilloscope 
we  have  additional  information  that  gives  further  support  to  the  photon  counting 
measurements as discussed in the next section.

4 D. Measurements of P0 P1 and P2

In the previous Subsection, we showed convincing evidence that we were managing 
both regimes of a pseudothermal light, well above and well below Tc, which show 
different  statistical  behavior.  However,  due  to  similarities  between  both  statistics 
the  histograms  predicted look  similar for  a  very  low  average  number  of  photons.
We will show in this section that analyzing the stored data in a different manner a 
better discrimination can be obtained, gaining confidence in the models applied.

We thus analyze here the probability of counting 0, 1 and 2 photons as a function of 
the time window, named as P0, P1 and P2, respectively. The time traces acquired in 
Experiments I and II were divided in smaller time sub-windows () and the number 
of peaks for each  was counted. 

For computing the probabilities P0, P1 and P2 for PS and BE conditions, we use the 
following expressions, using Eqs. (2) and (4):

and P2() for  the PS  and BE cases are also shown in  the figure. For a  given (and 
even rather low) average of counts both statistics  behave quite differently and the 
experimental data can be clearly contrasted with the alternative models. From Fig. 7 
the results are conclusive: since the experimental points overlap to only one of the 
two  theoretical  predictions,  we  conclude  that  follows  BE  statistics.    The  same 
analysis  has  been  done  with  the  data  of  Experiment  II, shown  in  Fig.  8,  with  the 
time  windows  up to  400s.  The results  are again  conclusive, indicating that  the 
light source analyzed in Experiment II follows PS statistics.

4 E. Measurements of arrival time

The expression of Eq. (6) suggest an additional test that could distinguish between 
PS  and  BE  statistics.  The  idea  is  to  check  if  P0(T)  and  Pat(T)  are  related  by  a 
proportional law. In such a case the source follows the PS behavior, otherwise the 
source is described by another statistics.

Fig.  9.  Comparison  between  P0  and  Pat  for  (a)  Experiment  I,  (b)  Experiment  II.    The 
proportionality present in (b) reaffirms the Poisson behavior.

Fig. 9(a) shows on one hand, the occurrences of arrival time intervals for the data of 
Experiment  I, normalized to the total number of computed intervals. On the other 
hand  it  is  shown  the  occurrence  for  0  photons,  normalized  to  the  number  of 
computed  time  windows  with  0  photons.  It  is  evident  from  this  figure  that  both 
curves are not proportionally related; therefore the corresponding experiment does 
not  follow  the  Poisson  statistics  as  it  was  stated  in  the  previous  sections.  For 
Experiment  II, Fig. 9(b)  shows that the curves are proportional one to  each other,
verifying the intrinsic Poisson statistics.

5. Conclusions

A  pseudo  thermal  light  source  was  studied  in  two  photon  counting  experiments. 
The parameters in each experiment were controlled to reach two limiting situations. 
The  Bose-Einstein  and  Poisson  statistics  were  clearly  observed  in  Experiments  I 
and II respectively. A modest undergraduate lab equipment was employed to obtain 
the time traces of the photon detection process. The results were first studied with 
traditional photon counting procedures and the two statistics could be observed. As 
the  time  traces  of  the  experiment  were  recorded,  additional  information  of  the
process could be computed: On one hand, the probabilities of 0, 1 and 2 photons as 

12

a  function  of  the  time  windows  were  measured  for  the  two  experiments.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  arrival  time  of  photons  was  studied  and  compared  with  the 
probability of 0 photons. The two additional tests gave a conclusive confirmation of 
the  results  obtained  with  the  traditional  methodology.  The  consistence  and 
conclusiveness of the results, and the simplicity of the experimental setup show that
the presented procedure is of interest for educational purposes.

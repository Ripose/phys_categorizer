Abstract 

Charge-exchange injection by means of carbon foils is a widely used method in 

accelerators. This paper discusses two critical issues concerning the use of carbon foils: 

efficiency and lifetime. An energy scaling of stripping efficiency was suggested and 

compared with measurements. Several factors that determine the foil lifetime – energy 

deposition, heating, stress and buckling – were studied by using the simulation codes 

MARS and ANSYS.

1.   Introduction 

Like many other laboratories, Fermilab employs a charge-exchange method during 

the injection of particle beams from the Linac to the Booster. The H− ions are accelerated 

to 400 MeV in the Linac and pass through a thin carbon foil when entering the Booster. 

The foil strips two electrons from each ion and converts the ions from H− to H+, which 

are then accelerated to 8 GeV in the Booster. Figure 1 shows the foil changer in the 

Booster and Figure 2 are used carbon foils. In the future, Fermilab plans to replace the 

Linac and Booster by a superconducting rf linac, nicknamed “Proton Driver” [1]. This 

machine will accelerate H− ions up to 8 GeV with total power of 0.5 MW. These H− ions 

will then be stripped to protons in foils and injected into the 120 GeV Main Injector for 

mass production of neutrinos aimed at a detector (MINOS) in mine shaft in Soudan, 

Minnesota to study neutrino oscillations.  

When the energy of H− ions increases, it becomes more difficult to convert H− to H+ 

in foils because the interaction cross sections are decreased at higher energies. One 

obvious way to compensate for the cross section reduction is to use thicker foils. 

Unfortunately this approach has limitations since it leads to more severe foil heating and 

stress, which would reduce the foil lifetime. This problem is especially important for high 

intensity hadron accelerators, in which minimal beam loss and proper foil lifetime are 

essential to machine operations. 

In this paper, we introduce an energy scaling of the stripping efficiency of carbon 

foils. It is based on two known measurements at 200 MeV and 800 MeV, respectively. 

The energy deposition and heating are studied numerically by the code MARS, whereas

the mechanical stress and buckling by another code ANSYS. Throughout the paper, 

Fermilab accelerators will be used in numerical examples. The same analysis can be 

applied to other machines, such as J-PARC (Japan) and SNS (U.S.A.). 

2.   Stripping efficiency of carbon foils 

2.1. Theory on cross section 

The theoretical approach for calculating the collisional electron-detachment cross 

section for negative hydrogen ions incident on hydrogen, helium, oxygen, nitrogen and 

other gas targets can be found in numerous publications. Here we will use the results 

from Gillespie in Refs. [2-5].  

  Gillespie’s method is an extension of Bethe’s theory. It employs the sum-rule 

technique in the Born approximation to sum over all excited final states of the H– ion for 

calculating the total electron loss cross section. This method is particularly useful in our 

case because H– ion has no bound excited states. The total electron loss cross section can 

be expressed as:

in which σ −1,0  is the cross section from H– to H0, σ −1,1  from H– to H+, n the final states 

of H–, m the final states of the target atom, a0 the Bohr radius, α the fine structure 

constant, β the relativistic factor, Inm,  Jnm and Knm integrals. The first integral Inm  is the 

asymptotic (high-energy) leading order contribution to the cross section and is 

independent of the incident velocity. The second and third integrals (Jnm and Knm) are the 

next order correction terms for low energies. By performing these integrals explicitly, 

Gillespie was able to obtain numerical results for the case of H– ions incident on various 

 

3 

FERMILAB-CONF-06-425-AD 

target atoms and claimed to be in agreement with experimental data, as shown in Figures 

3 and 4 [2,3]. 

2.2. Energy scaling of stripping efficiency of carbon foils 

It is interesting to note that the physics governing the foil stripping and residual gas 

stripping is the same. It is only because of the enormous difference in atom density 

between foil and residual gas that the H− ions can travel thousands of meters in the 

transport line free of stripping and, suddenly, be fully stripped by a foil in a distance of a 

  When H– ion energy increases, the cross section decreases as shown in Section 2.1. 

As a consequence, the stripping efficiency also decreases. This is a major concern for 

high energy (e.g. 8 GeV) H– injection, because low efficiency implies high injection 

 

Several cross section measurements of H– ion incident on carbon foil at different 

energies have been reported [6-11]. For example, Figure 5 shows the data at 200 MeV 

measured by Webber and Hojvat [8] and Figure 6 the data measured by Gulley et al. at 

few μm! 

losses.  

800 MeV [7].  

The stripping efficiency at the two energies is remarkably different. For instance, 

when a 200 μg/cm2 foil is sued, only 0.4% H0 remains after the foil at 200 MeV, whereas 

the number of H0 is increased to 11.2% at 800 MeV. In order to estimate the stripping 

efficiency at other energies, we invoke the energy scaling of the cross section in Eq. (1), 

namely, the cross section decreases asymptotically as 1/β2, where β is the relativistic 

factor of H– ions.  

 

4 

FERMILAB-CONF-06-425-AD 

We based our scaling on the 800 MeV data, because they have higher accuracy. We 

first scaled the 800 MeV data to 200 MeV and compared them with the measured data at 

200 MeV. We found them in good agreement and this gave us confidence. We then 

scaled the 800 MeV data to 400 MeV and 8 GeV. The predicted 400 MeV cross sections 

will be compared with the planned measurement at the Fermilab Booster. Table 1 is a 

summary of these numbers. 

Figure 7 is a plot of the H0 population for the 5 cases listed in Table 1 at different foil 

thicknesses. The two curves for 200 MeV, one measured and another calculated using the 

scaling, lay almost completely on top of each other. This indicates the scaling works well 

in this energy region. Because the scaling is asymptotically correct at high energies, it is 

expected to work even better at 8 GeV. 

Based on this estimation, the carbon foil thickness is chosen to be 600 μg/cm2 for the 

8 GeV Proton Driver, which corresponds to 0.5% H0 population in this analytic model. 

Alternatively, one may employ two consecutive foils with a thickness of 300 μg/cm2 of 

each. 

3. Lifetime of carbon foils 

3.1. Energy deposition 

We will use Fermilab Proton Driver as an example in this section. It has two injection 

scenarios: 90-turn injection that has a beam current of 25 mA and pulse duration of 1 ms, 

270-turn injection that has a beam current of 8 mA and pulse duration of 3 ms. In each 

case the total number of particles is the same, namely, 25 × 10−6 Coulomb, or 1.56 × 1014 

H− ions. There are three particles in each H− ion: one proton and two electrons. Therefore 

the number of particles is about N = 4.7 × 1014.  

 

5 

FERMILAB-CONF-06-425-AD 

The energy loss of moderately relativistic particles other than electrons in matter is 

primarily due to ionization and atomic excitation. For 8 GeV protons incident on a carbon 

foil, the stopping power |dE/dz| = 1.847 MeV/(g/cm2) [12]. When an electron travels 

together with an 8 GeV proton, its kinetic energy is 4.357 MeV. The stopping power, is 

1.71 MeV/(g/cm2) [13].  

In the present design, there are two foils separated by a 40 cm gap. The dimension of 

the foils is 12 mm × 12 mm. Each foil has a thickness of 300 μg/cm2. The energy 

deposition on each foil would be 554 eV by one proton and 513 eV by one electron. 

While the electrons would hit the foil only once, the protons would hit it multiple times 

during injection. Simulation shows the average number of hits for each proton is 4.4 (90-

turn) and 15.9 (270-turn), respectively. Taking these into account, the total energy 

deposition on each foil during injection is, respectively, 0.1833 J (by protons, 90-turn 

injection), 0.6625 J (by protons, 270-turn injection), and 0.07715 J (by electrons).  The 

injection interval is 1.5 sec.  

The beam size is 0.8 × 0.4 cm2, and the distribution is Gaussian. Using σx = 0.2 cm 

and σy = 0.1 cm, the energy deposition per unit area D(x,y) can be written as:

where A is the total energy deposition listed above. The space distributions of particles 

for each turn were simulated by the code STRUCT [14]. The results are then fed into the 

code MARS [15] where interactions of the protons and electrons in the carbon foils were 

simulated and the deposited energy calculated. It was assumed that the energy deposition 

is instantaneous and there is no evolution of the foil temperature during injection (see 

 

6 

FERMILAB-CONF-06-425-AD 

Section 3.3 below).  The specific heat of carbon foils is 0.165 cal/g-K or 0.6908 J/g-K at 

room temperature and is treated as a function of temperature in the calculation because it 

rises in a hot foil.     

3.2. Thermal analysis using MARS 

In the calculation, we make a conservative approximation. For the first foil, it is 

assumed that all H− ions are stripped in the very upstream part of the foil and electrons 

pass through it contributing to the heating. In the meantime, it is also assumed that a 

maximum of 20% of H− could survive the first foil and get stripped in the second foil.  

Table 2 lists the energy deposition and temperature rise due to heating by protons and 

electrons for each injection scheme. It can be seen that the instantaneous temperature rise 

in both foils for the 270-turn injection scheme would bring the temperature close to the 

melting point of carbon, which is about 3600 °C. The peak energy deposited due to 

protons only for the 270-turn injection scheme is the same as the combined energy due to 

protons and electrons because of a specific space distribution of the electrons.  

Figures 8-9 are graphical representations of the temperature rise after one cycle. The 

size of the histograms corresponds to the size of the foil. 

3.3. Thermal and mechanical analysis using ANSYS 

The thermal process is governed by diffusion. In the carbon foil, it propagates at 

0.174 cm2/s. During 1 ms (3 ms) beam pulse, the diffusion length is 0.0132 cm (0.0228 

cm), much smaller than the foil size. The mechanical process propagates with speed of 

sound, which is 2558 m/s in carbon. During 1 ms (3 ms) beam pulse, the mechanical 

disturbance propagates 255.8 cm (767.4 cm), much larger than the foil size. Therefore, as 

 

7 

FERMILAB-CONF-06-425-AD 

far as the thermal process is concerned, energy deposition can be considered 

instantaneous. But it is static as far as the mechanical process is concerned. 

A finite element model of ANSYS is built to simulate the problem. The model is 

supported on top and right sides (both thermally and mechanically). The interaction 

between the two foils (heating each other by radiation) is neglected. 

In thermal analysis, both initial and boundary conditions are 275 K. Energy 

deposition is input as heat rate (energy divided by time). Since it occurs on a time scale 

which is very small compared to heat diffusion, energy deposition is instantaneous. The 

temperature increase of the carbon foil can be calculated just as the integration of energy 

deposition over density and specific heat. After the pulse, in a period of 1.5 second there 

will be no energy deposition. Heat will then be taken out by thermal radiation. Figure 10 

is a typical temperature history at the hottest spot. The temperature cycle reaches 

equilibrium quickly (in two or three cycles). Maximum temperature (just after the beam 

pulse) is plotted in Figures 11-12. 

Since the mechanical process can be considered static, the only load is the thermal 

stress induced in the foil. Using the maximum temperature from thermal analysis, the 

static displacement and stress are calculated. These results are summarized in Table 3 and 

plotted in Figs. 13 through 16. (Note: There is some difference in maximum temperature 

between Table 2 and 3. This is attributed to the different algorithm used in the codes 

MARS and ANSYS.) 

Buckling analysis was performed on a model representing one quarter of the foil, 

using large deformation option in finite element. To break the symmetry, small load was 

applied perpendicularly at the center of the foil. The thermally induced load was then 

 

8 

FERMILAB-CONF-06-425-AD 

applied, and the buckled deformation was obtained after removing the small symmetry 

breaking load. The results are shown in Figs. 17-19. The maximum displacement is 0.038 

cm. At first glance this may seem small, but in relative terms it is rather significant. 

Assuming a 0.0003 cm thick foil (i.e. 600 μg/cm2 carbon foil of density 2 g/cm3) this 

displacement is more than 100 times as large as the foil thickness. 

3.4. Carbon foil lifetime 

 

There are a number of factors that have impact on the lifetime of carbon foils: instant 

temperature rise, average temperature rise, mechanical stress and displacement, fatigue 

due to thermal buckling, sublimation (solid to gas transition at temperatures above 1600 

°C), radiation damage of the structure [16], etc. Although we know how to estimate these 

effects either analytically or numerically, it is not clear which one is the determining 

factor. It is quite likely that the failure of a carbon foil is a combinational result of all 

these factors. Furthermore, foil manufacture technique and foil microstructure play a 

major role in lifetime. For the same ion bombardment, different types of foils can have 

vastly different lifetime. Hence, beam test in an accelerator is the ultimate way to 

determine the lifetime of a carbon foil. 

4.   Discussion 

Liouville’s theorem precludes multi-turn injection of particles identical to those 

already present in a circulating beam. H− injection through a stripping foil provides a 

mean to circumvent this difficulty. As the energy increases, however, stripping 

efficiencies tend to decrease, which leads to the employment of thick foils. But the 

thickness is limited by thermal and mechanical considerations and cannot arbitrarily 

increase to compensate for the reduction in interaction cross-section. Furthermore, a thick 

 

9 

FERMILAB-CONF-06-425-AD 

foil would result in more severe effects on the beam (e.g. emittance dilution due to 

multiple Coulomb scattering, acceptance limit due to large angle single Coulomb 

scattering, energy straggling, etc.) as well as on the machine (e.g. radiation activation of 

magnets nearby the foil). But these topics are beyond the scope of this paper. 

In a high intensity proton machine, uncontrolled particle loss must be kept at a very 

low level in order to prevent activation of the accelerator components. A balance between 

the foil efficiency and foil lifetime must be studied carefully. It is necessary to design 

conservatively and ensure that adequate safety factors are introduced. Progress in foil 

technology reported at this conference demonstrates the possibility of new foils of much 

longer lifetime compared to the conventional ones [17]. This is encouraging news. Plans 

are under way to install these new foils in an operational accelerator for long term testing.

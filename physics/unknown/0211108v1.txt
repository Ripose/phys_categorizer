QUANTISING GENERAL RELATIVITY USING QED THEORY

Sarah B. M. Bell1,2 and Bernard M. Diaz1,3

Abstract

We apply QED theory to quantum gravity and find it leads to general

relativity in the classical limit. We discuss the implications of the result

for the quantum-classical divide. This enables us to relate our result to M-

theory.

1. GENERAL RELATIVITY AND QED THEORY

1.1 The equation of circular motion

We broaden our previous discussion(5-8) of QED theory by including

general relativity. We introduce a space 1L with a metric,

1.2 The quantum condition

We describe the preon’s motion by the parallel transport of a vector
giving its position round the orbit.(28) For Cartesian co-ordinates in a flat

space this is the same, except for the sign of the angle turned, as changing

the orientation of the position vector with respect to fixed axes. We find

It will be convenient to describe the movement of the preon in 1C as a

unless we wish to emphasise the distinction.

1.3 Electromagnetism and gravity compared

We described QED theory in the context of electromagnetism using

an inverse distance-squared law for the force and Bohr’s equations in the
interrelated spaces S, M and L.(6-8) S and M map to L and we use
only L where possible here. Bohr’s equations for electromagnetism(6) are

where we may assume the Bohr electron is in an inertial frame in, for

systems of this type Bohr interactions(6) if they are accompanied by an

inverse distance-squared law for the force,

may represent our gravitational system in 1L by a solution of the versatile
Dirac equation,(5-7) with the potential given by Maxwell’s equations for
the photon.(12) By the Dirac equation, we shall always mean the versatile

Dirac equation, which is identical to the original for half-angular
behaviour of the spinor.(5) We use four-vector behaviour here.

The behaviour of the spinor phase is then the same as that ofxˆ in

equations (1.2.O).(6) We suppose the two waves are identical,

commenting on the wavelength in section 2.2. We calculate the
exponential part of the wave function in 1C using 1L as a model,(6)

sm~ and pm become

an imaginary gv corresponds to the transformation induced by using

charge conjugation on the Dirac equation.(5, 7)

pm and m may be imaginary

with the other variables real but

sm~ and sm are negative. We also use the
tachyonic transformation,(8) which gives physical meaning to the use of

imaginary energies and momenta combined with the corresponding

imaginary co-ordinates, or, equivalently, changes the signature of a
space.(8) Here gv is inverted.

2. QUANTUM COSMOLOGY

2.1 The shell model

A circular symmetry became a spherical symmetry when the source
was localised in the electromagnetic case.(6, 7) The Bohr electron was then

confined to the surface of a sphere of radius eR centred on the source in L.

The surface was formed from a superposition of the annular orbits of the

Bohr electron, the Bohr orbits. Although a separate source is needed for

an attractive interaction if it is electromagnetic, gravity has an attractive

self-interaction, which we study by removing the source from the centre

of the sphere. We call the result the thin shell model. We discuss both the

internal and external appearance of such a shell, supposing that both obey

equations (1.3.H) and (1.3.I).

with a metric,

From the internal view, the interior of the shell is a new space,

The gravitational interaction of thin shells has been studied
extensively,(1, 9-11, 16, 21-23, 26) where we have chosen some citations whose

treatment is particularly appropriate. A motion along a great circle at

every point on a classical shell is impossible and the literature discusses

radial motion. The quantum treatment we proposed above is new in that

we suppose the motion is tangential to a circular orbit but a connection
with atomic spectra has already been noticed,(11) after using the standard
method(18) of quantisation, which we call s-quantisation. Kuchar(26) finds
that the interior of the shell is flat5 in the classical case and that the total

energy of the shell is

um and uR  are arbitrary, apart from

the condition in equation (2.2.B), and um is not to be confused with the

mass of the universe calculated using other models from the classical

theory. We add a second thin shell, the copyshell, which generates the

metric in equation (2.1.F) in 1C in the absence of other shells. We suppose

that uv and gv may remain unchanged by the addition of the copyshell or

that they may change, each alternative giving rise to a different model.

We represent both possibilities as hierarchies, starting with the first.

Our discussion already constrains the relation between the internal

view of a shell in 0L and the external view in 1C and also shows that we

may map the external view to a flat space,

.1L We suppose this is the

internal view of another shell. The new shell has an external view in a

curved space

,2C which we may map to a flat space

,2L if we apply v-

quantisation in 2L and not

.1L The relation between the internal and external

view of the new shell is the same as it was for the original shell. We may

repeat this procedure, downwards as well as upwards, obtaining the

sequences in table 1,

multiplied by the mass of the preon give the internal energy. The first two

values in the sixth column give the quantum numbers n and m for the

copyshell hierarchy, where we have applied v-quantisation to ,1L and the ?

signify that only the ratio is known for the unishell. R is constant

throughout. The second column comes from equations (1.2.J) applied to

the fifth column, the fourth column comes from equations (1.3.J), the

fifth from equation (2.1.I) and the sixth from equation (1.2.K), where we

do not insist on m being integer. All are applied in .lL We cannot apply

equations (1.3.H) to the unishell hierarchy in 2L and we have not included

it.

The hierarchies in table 1 are scaling if we represent the mass of the

source as an area. We may plot them as tiles in a tiling hierarchy, an
example of a tesseral hierarchy.(3, 17) One with this branching ratio was
first explored by Lusby Taylor.(27) At each level in table 1 the preon is

accompanied by the wave described in sections 1 and 2. We may see the

hierarchies as generated by the wave and we describe the method for the

copyshell. After a time

,Tt = when the preon has completed one circuit of

the orbit in

,0L the phase of the wave has completed n circuits in

,0L from

equation (1.2.O) and m circuits in

,1C from equations (1.2.P) and (2.1.J).

In section 2.1 we used general relativity to combine 0L and 1C  into a single

space we will call

,1

where l indexes the spaces lL and

1+lC and

.1+lC This automatically includes the exchange of a spatial and the
temporal co-ordinate in the map (2.1.L).7 We would like to suppose, in

addition to using our original argument in section 1 to relate the preon in

lL and

,lC that the preon in lL and

,'lL

¢„ are the same. If we use

arguments which only rely on the relationships between levels and not on

their absolute value, we may do this for a tesseral hierarchy, since it is

between their velocities.(31)

These describe series,

.1-(cid:215) l The first and third series describe a tesseral hierarchy with a

branching ratio of m2 and ,m respectively, interleaved with one whose

branching ratio is the same as the square root of the branching ratio of the

Lusby Taylor hierarchy. We may also reverse the direction of a tesseral
hierarchy(4) so that the second series is the same as the third. We shall

restrict our series to the one made explicit in table 2 for all the algebraic

calculations that follow.

We continue with the first model. The presence of two shells, the

unishell and copyshell, destroys the spatial symmetry and we suppose

that the wave function of both collapse to a single annulus in orthogonal

subspaces of

.1L The unishell then combines with the copyshell to form the

combishell. A preon, on the shell surface, as it always will be from now

on, acquires the rotational motion of both the original orbits round the

unishell and copyshell, with the first a contribution to the energy and the

second to the momentum. The energy-momentum four-vector is
(

Equation (1.3.I), continues to hold,(28) which means that the

interaction can be represented by the Dirac equation, omitting the
quantisation implied by the second of equations (1.3.H).(6, 8) We call this

Planck quantisation or p-quantisation. It is weaker than v-quantisation,

implying only that n is integer. The Dirac equation becomes classical in
the absence of p-quantisation.(8)

For the second model, we suppose the two shells form a single
hierarchy at every scale. This is our final rendition of Mach’s principle. (19)

In addition to the total energy of the source, the second column contains

the mass of the preon. The entries are chosen to satisfy equations (2.1.B)

23

Quantising general relativity using QED theory

Instead of using the gravitational constant of the motion ,g we may

deduce the metric by supposing that curvature is caused by a rotational

motion, directly, and using the Lorentz transformations. We introduce a

equations (1.3.F) and (1.3.H) and adopting co-ordinates showing spatial

Schwarzschild metric, we have made rd an interval along the radius but

the motion we have studied so far is tangent to a circular orbit. We

conjecture that a Lorentz contraction takes place along the radius for a

quantum rotational motion. We give our reasons. Since general relativity

predicts it, we know that the conjecture holds if the rotational motion is

caused by gravitational attraction. We may put the equations for

24

Quantising general relativity using QED theory

electromagnetism, (1.3.A), and (1.3.C), into the same form as the

equivalent for gravity, (1.3.H) and (1.3.I), by setting the charge on the

We may then argue that the Maxwell and Dirac equations hold with the
dashed values in the same way as we did previously.(7, 8) We may also

offer the same explanatory framework as we have done for general

relativity. The conjecture then supposes that we associate the curvature

with the motion in the quantum case, rather than the field. However, we

have not explored generalising this formulation of QED-theory to other

gauge fields.

3. QED THEORY

3.1 The full solution for gravity

The inverse-distance relation between a source and the potential
leads to Maxwell’s equations, as we found. (7) The equations, in the form

defining the gravitational four-vector potential,

,mA become Poisson’s

equation and are still exact if mA and the gravitational charge density four-

vector,

,mr are scalars,

0A and

,0r that do not depend on time.(12, 30)

Poisson’s equation is the differential form of Newton’s law of gravity if,

in addition, we allow 0A and 

0r to vary with time.(30) Dirac’s equation

25

Quantising general relativity using QED theory

describes the movement of a particle in the potential,

,mA and has a

classical form, which could be described as a relativistic representation of
circular motion.(8) The Maxwell and Dirac equations are obeyed for the

interaction between a particle and an arbitrary distribution of source

density,

),mmr x
(

if Bohr’s equations are obeyed, (7) as they are in 1L if we

leave out the coupling to the unishell. We need to transform to the

tachyon frame to compare the result with our experience of time but then

proceed as we discuss in more detail for

,2L where Bohr’s equations are

also obeyed, if we include the coupling to the unishell.

We move from 1L to

of source density.(7) We

reserve mr for a source and Bohr radius of

sm and R, respectively, while the

equivalent for mr are

( )2~
sm and .R Then we put the Maxwell and Dirac

equations on a lattice and show that the result is scaling,(7, 8) in the sense
normally understood for renormalisation.(29) For this and for

renormalisation itself, we suppose that the bare gravitational and inertial

masses are independent, inserting the physical equality at the end. We can
use either the computational methods of lattice gauge theory(7, 8) for

renormalisation or, for small velocities, the propagator approach. The
Dirac equation with a source term(29) is not explicitly covariant for four-

vector behaviour of the mass term, although we may choose any one
frame and insert a scalar value equivalent to the rest mass.(5) We find the

propagator in this frame and then the wave function, which does satisfy

the Dirac equation with joint four-vector behaviour of the wave function

and mass term.

In general relativity, the mass density,

energy-momentum-stress or matter tensor,

,mr becomes the second rank
.mnT (28) If mnT is in the form of

the direct product,

,nmvv

of two equal four-vectors, the Einstein tensor,

,mnG (28) is necessarily of this form too and we may decompose the

Einstein equation into a four-vector equation. We define a map,

We have shown that QED theory can be used to provide a

renormalisable quantum version of general relativity for simple matter

tensors. We discuss the implications of our results for composite matter

tensors by proposing a thought experiment, which, with modifications,

could also be performed in practice using a computer simulation. We may

calculate a weighted sum of the simple matter tensors at a single point,

from simple ones, depends only on the latter.8

3.2 Bohr’s equations and quantisation

We have now given several accounts, here and previously,(5-8) of

systems that obey Bohr’s equations. We draw the threads together. We

started with electromagnetism and described a system with a spatial
circular orbit that obeyed Bohr’s equations. (6) This took place in a flat
.L (6-8) We showed that Bohr’s equations were still

space, one of S, M or

obeyed if we exchanged and complexified the temporal co-ordinate and a
spatial co-ordinate defining the orbit.(8) We have shown here that Bohr’s

equations are also obeyed if we transfer to a curved space,

.1C  The

addition of curvature permits us to describe the system using only the co-

ordinates defining the orbit. Since we know that the quantum theory is
QED if Bohr’s equations are obeyed, (7, 8) QED theory applies to all these

systems.

It may be wondered what has happened to the transition from a

classical to a quantum theory, since the standard method replaces

variables with operators obeying commutation or anticommutation
relations.(18) We call this s-quantisation. The underlying equations on

which our method depends are Bohr’s. Bohr’s first equation is an
approximation of Maxwell’s theory, (12) joining an inverse distance-

squared law for an electrical force to the Newtonian equation for a
relativistic circular motion.(14) Bohr’s second equation for Planck
quantisation was considered new.(13) Both together seem at first sight to

form a new theory, the old quantum theory, as it emerged in Bohr’s
hands.(13-15) Appearances are deceptive. The quantum condition we use

for Planck quantisation in section 2.2 originally arose from the

30

Quantising general relativity using QED theory

requirement that the spatial part of a wave function be single-valued for a
bound state.(6) However, we have now shown that only two-dimensional

co-ordinates, for example,tand r or qdr

and ,r are required and so we

insist on no more than a single-valued wave function.

The reflector wave function can be seen as a new generalisation of

the quaternion algebra(2) in which a Lorentz transformation, implemented
by a temporal rotation, mirrors a spatial rotation,(5)

where all the variables are functions of quaternions and TR has a unit

modulus. The first and second equations describe the same spatial

rotation while the third describes a temporal rotation. With this algebra

the spin of a fermion varies like a four-vector. This means that the wave

function can describe the positions of both the original particle and a

second particle in addition and leads to the hierarchical system of
particles in table 2.9

We have arrived at an economical redefinition of Bohr’s second

equation; that the wave must have a single value at each point. The usual

distinction between a quantum and a classical system has gone and, yet, it
is still possible to derive QED theory in its usual form.(7, 8) We examined

general relativity to see if this classical theory was sufficiently like the

over histories applied to a particle whose unobserved course is indeterminable.

31

Quantising general relativity using QED theory

classical limit of quantum electrodynamics for us to apply Bohr’s

equations to the former as well as the latter. We found that an hierarchy

of scaling versions of both theories was required, all compatible with

Bohr’s equations. Judicious choice of scale provides the same link, in like

cases, between the Dirac current and the energy of the quantum system as

that found in general relativity between the matter tensor and the metric.

We have in this way applied QED-theory to general relativity without s-

quantisation as the preliminary step.

3.3 M-theory

String theory and its derivative M-theory is based on the assumption

that the building block of the physical world is the string.(24) Like string

theory, instead of discussing two concepts, a field or curvature, which

then acts on some unrelated particle, we discuss the interaction itself. We

show that M-theory and QED theory could converge with this common

approach. We have substituted excitations of a topological loop for a
bound fermion.(6, 8) We may also include the winding number and arrive
at the complete expression for the energy of a compactified string, E.(24)

Using

We may still build a single hierarchy with one parameter per level. We

2L with

and

entries for the copyshell. We treat each level in the original hierarchies

similarly and interleave them in order, obtaining a new scaling hierarchy

explicitly. We may also join the two originals to a third hierarchy, again

different, if we iterate by the replacement,

the energy of the original string in equation (3.3.A). From equations

(3.1.A), (3.3.F) and (3.3.I),

(3.3.H).

Since we have not chosen the usual route to quantising a string,(24)

our findings do not apply to any single quantised string theory but to their

classical point of departure. However, M-theory not only rests on the

same origin but is also held to signal the physical content in a common

theory. We might therefore hope that our results comply with M-theory.

35

Quantising general relativity using QED theory

4. DISCUSSION

We have shown that in addition to half-angular behaviour of the

wave function under rotation and its equivalent under Lorentz

transformation, QED theory may be reproduced with four-vector
behaviour.(5) Using this theory we recovered the usual result for a bound

state of two point particles in which the potential followed an inverse-
distance law.(6, 8) We generalised this(7, 8) to show that QED theory could

be reduced to two conditions; firstly, that force varying as the inverse

distance-squared should result in the circular motion of a particle, which,

secondly, can be described by a field that is single-valued over a space.

We found that these conditions were compatible with general

relativity. Both theories are relativistic and this leads to part of the latter

theory having a quantum limit that can be described by the former. We

have not shown that QED theory is the only possible quantum theory of

gravity nor that a more complete quantum theory is impossible. Nor have

we shown the relation between electromagnetism and gravity. We have

only shown that they function in the same manner. The curvature usually

associated with general relativity did not enter this result directly.

We have also shown that QED theory is likely to be related to M-

theory as both rely on closed loops. It is hoped that a renormalisable

quantum theory of gravity allied to M-theory might be of interest.

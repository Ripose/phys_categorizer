Abstract 

There  are  more  than  15  years  since  the  transition-jump  system  (TJS)  was  installed.   

Because  of  the  quad  steering,  which  is  caused  by  the  beam  not  being  well  centered 

through all the γΤ quads, the TJS has never been used in the operation.  Based upon the 

recent calculation, the short 12 γΤ quad had the worst offset in the vertical direction, and 

it was lowered 4 mm.  Afterwards, the orbit error caused by the γΤ quad steering has been 

largely removed, and this encourages our efforts of commissioning the TJS  to reach its 

design goal.    

Introduction 

The  TJS  has  been  installed  in  the  Fermilab  Booster  since  1987  for  the  purpose  of 

reducing the deleterious effects of passing through transition at high intensity by reducing 

the time that the  beam  spends  near the transition energy.[1,2]  However, since those  γΤ 

quads are not well aligned relative to the usual closed orbit, quad steering can cause beam 

loss, especially for high intensity beams, and a dispersion wave after transition.  This is 

the major reason why the TJS has never been used in the operation since its installation.   

A program, which uses the difference in the closed orbits when γΤ quads are on 

and  off  and  calculates  the  offsets  of  the  beam  relative  to  γΤ  quads,  has  been  developed 

and  tested.[3]    Besides,  a  radial  orbit  offset  (ROF)  has  been  experimentally  applied  in 

finding  the  optimal  radial  position  for  centering  the  beam  through  all  the  γΤ  quads,

thereby  eliminating  the  immediate  need  for  repositioning  the  quads  in  the  horizontal 

direction.  Unfortunately, any vertical offset requires the reposition of the beam relative 

to  the  γΤ  quad  either  by  applying  a  local  three-bump  to  the  beam  or  by  moving  the  γΤ 

quad.   

 

 

Experimental Results 

Based upon the calculated vertical offsets,[3] as shown in Fig. 1(a), since the short 12 γΤ 

quad was the worst one with an offset of 8 mm above the beam center, it was lowered 4 

mm, which is the maximum amount allowed by the quad stand.  Besides, the BPM (beam 

position monitor) used for controlling the ROF was recently moved from the section of 

long 18 to the section of long 20, the programmed ROF was again used to move the beam 

radially when the γΤ quads were pulsed to establish the ROF setting where the beam was 

best centered through all the γΤ quads.  The optimal ROF setting has changed from 3 to -
4.5.    All  the  measurements  were  done  at  the  extracted  beam  intensity  of  0.75×1012 

protons.  The difference orbit between γΤ quads on and off was measured at six different 

ROF values, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0; the horizontal and vertical difference orbits are shown in 

Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) separately.  All the orbits with γΤ quads on were taken at the same γΤ 

quad current with those in Fig. 1(a), which is 780 A.  The black, red, green, blue, cyan, 

magenta curves represent six different ROF values of -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, and 0 respectively.  

It is clear that the beam is best centered through all the γΤ quads at the ROF value of -4.5 

(the middle of -5 and -4).  The calculated vertical offsets of the beam relative to γΤ quads 

are  shown  in  Fig.  2(c).    Comparing  the  vertical  offset  before  and  after  the  short  12  γΤ 

quad movement, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 2(c), the offset at short 12 has changed 

from -8 mm to -4 mm, which is consistent with the amount of the movement.   

Furthermore, one expects that better the beam is centered through all the γΤ quads, 

less the difference orbit between γΤ quads on and off depends upon the peak value of the 

γΤ waveform, and smaller the difference orbit will be.  The ROF was set to the optimal 

value of -4.5.  The difference orbit was taken at six different γΤ quad settings of 1.75 kV, 

2.0  kV,  2.25  kV,  2.5  kV,  2.75  kV,  and  3.0  kV.    The  horizontal  and  vertical  difference

orbits are shown in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b).  The black, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta curves 

represent six different γΤ quad settings of 1.75 kV, 2.0 kV, 2.25 kV, 2.5 kV, 2.75 kV, and 

3.0  kV  respectively.    Since  ideally  the  difference  orbit  between  γΤ  quads  on  and  off 

should be zero, the difference orbit can be represented as the orbit error either in average 

or in rms.  The horizontal and vertical orbit errors are shown in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d).   The 

black and red curves represent the orbit error in average and in rms respectively.  There is 

a slight dependence between the horizontal orbit error in rms and the γΤ quad setting, and 

the horizontal orbit error in rms is about 0.1 mm.  Comparably, the vertical orbit error in 

rms is independent of the γΤ quad setting, and is about 0.06 mm.  So till now, the beam is 

well centered through all the γΤ quads at the ROF setting of -4.5, which was used for all 

the following experiments.   

 

There  are  three  important  parameters,  which  need  to  be  adjusted  in  the 

experiment,  for  the  purpose  of  minimizing  the  time  that  the  beam  spends  near  the 

transition  energy,  compensating  the  phase-space  mismatch  caused  by  space  charge  at 

transition,  and  minimizing  the  beam  loss  when  the  γΤ  quads  are  pulsed.    These  three 

parameters are the γΤ quad setting (V), the trigger time (TP) for pulsing γΤ quads, and the 

transition gate (TG).  V determines the amount of the reduction in γΤ (∆γΤ).  ∆γΤ decides 

how earlier TG could be relative to the normal transition gate (tg).  Earlier TP is, earlier TG 

is, and less time the beam spends near the transition energy.  Since TG must be set to the 

time when the beam energy is equal or close to the transition energy, larger ∆γΤ is, lower 

the transition energy could be, and earlier TG could be.  TG must be set in the range of TP 

to TP+0.1 ms since it takes 0.1 ms, which is the rising time of the γΤ waveform, for ∆γΤ to 

reach its maximum.  Within this range, the delay between TG and TP is mainly determined 

by  the  optimal  condition  for  compensating  the  phase-space  mismatch  caused  by  space 

charge.  However, since the larger ∆γΤ is, the stronger the quad steering usually is, it is 

likely that a small portion of the high intensity beam will be lost when the γΤ quads are 

pulsed.  Since the optimal settings for parameters V, TP, and TG are usually determined by 

their  intrinsic  relations  and  the  beam  intensity,  they  need  to  be  optimized  for  different 

beam intensities via experiment.   

 

3

According to the relations among V, TP, and TG, V needs to be determined first, 

and  it  should  be  set  to  the  maximum  value  before  any  beam  loss  starts.    Afterwards, 

fixing the time delay between TG and TP to a reasonable value via experience, such as 20 

µs, one adjusts TP to find the optimal setting based upon the criteria that there should be 

the  least  change  in  the  bunch  shape  and  bunch  lengthen  cross  the  transition.    Finally, 

setting TP to its optimal value, one scans the delay between TG and TP in the range of 0 to 

100  µs  in  a  small  step,  such  as  5  µs,  to  find  the  optimal  setting  for  TG  based  upon  the 

same criteria for the optimization of TP.  In the experiment, the bunch length and bunch 

shape are monitored by the resistive wall signal.   

The  above  procedures  are  used  to  find  the  optimal  settings  of  V,  TP,  and  TG  for 

two different beam intensities.                

 

First,  the  mountain  range  plot  (MRP)  was  used  to  record  the  process  of  the 

transition  jump  at  the  extracted  beam  intensity  of  0.75×1012  protons.    The  MRP  was 

triggered 100 µs before the transition, with 1 trace per 60 turns for 30 traces.  V could be 

set to a much higher value than those for high intensity beams, since in general, lower the 

beam intensity is, smaller the beam transverse size and emittance are, and higher the limit 

for the quad steering can be achieved.  We took advantage of running the beam at a low 

intensity, experimentally investigated relations among V, TP, and TG, and found whether 

or  not  the  TJS  would  help  in  reducing  the  beam  load  during  the  transition  and  gaining 

some effective accelerating voltages.  From the MRP of Figs. 4(a) to 4(r), the optimal TG 

vs. TP at three different V settings of 2.0 kV, as shown in Fig. 4(b), 2.5 kV, as shown in 

Fig. 4(i), and 3.0 kV, as shown in Fig. 4(q), are extracted using the criteria of the least 

bunch-length oscillation.  The results are shown in Fig. 5(a), and are consistent with the 

above  analysis,  which  indicates  that  TP  should  be  set  to  an  earlier  time  when  V  is  at  a 

larger value.  Besides, at a fixed TP of 18.4 ms, the optimal delays between TG and TP at 

two different V of 2.5 kV, from Figs. 4(g) to 4(l), and 3.0 kV, from Figs. 4(s) to 4(u), are 

extracted, and shown in Fig. 5(b).  Once the RF accelerating voltage curve is fixed, the 

synchronous phase determines the effective accelerating voltage,[4] and it was found to 

be  independent  of  different  settings  for  V,  TP,  and  TG  in  the  experiment,    as  shown  in 

Figs. 5(c) and 5(d).

The  high  intensity  situation  is  quite  different  from  the  low  intensity.    The  same 

procedures, which were used at the extracted beam intensity of 0.75×1012 protons, were 

used for the extracted beam intensity of 4.0×1012 protons.  The maximum V was found to 

be 1.5 kV.  TG was fixed at its optimal value of 18.70 ms.  TG was varied at eight different 

values of 18.71 ms, 18.72 ms, 18.25 ms, 18.3 ms, 18.35 ms, 18.4 ms, 18.5 ms, and 18.6 

ms,  and  their  MRP  are  shown  in  Figs.  6(a)  to  6(h)  respectively.    The  optimal  TG  was 

found to be somewhere between 18.25 ms (Fig. 6(c)) to 18.30 ms (Fig. 6(d)).  MRP at the 

normal operational condition is shown in Fig. 6(i).  Comparing Fig. 6(c) to Fig. 6(i), the 

bunch  was  shorter  and  the  bunch  length  oscillation  was  much  stronger  during  the 

transition in Fig. 6(i) than those in Fig. 6(c).   

Comment 

The  design  goal  of  the  TJS  is  to  reduce  the  deleterious  effects  of  high  intensity  beam 

passing through transition by reducing the time that the beam spends near the transition 

energy.    It  is  experimentally  demonstrated  that  the  TJS  can  be  used  to  reduce  the  peak 

current during the transition crossing and compensate the phase-space mismatch caused 

by the space charge via properly timing TP and TG to avoid the shortening and oscillation 

in the bunch length.     

However,  the  emittance  growth  before  transition,  especially  in  the  early  part  of 

the cycle when the space charge influence is the strongest, couldn’t be cured by the TJS.   

Besides, from the present investigation, it is clear that the commission of the TJS couldn’t 

reduce  the  requirement  for  the  amount  of  the  accelerating  voltage  at  the  transition;  the 

beam  intensity  is  mainly  limited  by  the  RF  power  unless  the  present  RF  system  is 

upgraded.  Furthermore, commissioning the TJS requires that the beam is well centered 

through all the γΤ quads during the entire γΤ waveform, which is about 4 to 5 ms.  The 

higher  the  beam  intensity  is,  the  more  strict  this  requirement  becomes,  and  this  puts  a 

serious constrain to the orbit during the transition.

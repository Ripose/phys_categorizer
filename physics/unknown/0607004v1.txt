Abstract: In this paper, the physics of flow instability and turbulent transition in shear flows is 

studied by analyzing the energy variation of fluid particles under the interaction of base flow with 

a  disturbance.  It  is  shown  that  it  is  the  transverse  energy  gradient  that  leads  to  the  disturbance 

amplification  while  the  disturbance  is  damped  by  the  energy  loss  due  to  viscosity  along  the 

streamline. For the first time, a theory derived strictly from physics, is used to show that the flow 

instability  under  finite  amplitude  disturbance  leads  to  turbulent  transition.  It  is  also  shown  that 

flow  instability  in  shear  flows  is  a  nonlinear  phenomenon  and  it  has  a  threshold  related  to  the 

disturbance  amplitude.  The  mechanism  for  velocity  inflection  and  hairpin  vortex  formation  are 

explained  with  reference  to  analytical  results.  The  inverse  Reynolds  number  dependence  of  the  

disturbance  threshold,  observed  in  recent  experiments,  is  well  explained.  Following  from  this 

analysis, it can be demonstrated that the critical value of the so called energy gradient parameter 

Kmax is constant for turbulent transition in parallel flows, and this is confirmed by experiments for 

pipe Poiseuille flow, plane Poiseuille flow, and plane Couette flow.

1. Introduction 

Turbulence  is  one  of  the  most  difficult  problems  in  classical  physics  and  mechanics.  

Turbulence research has a history of more than 120 years, since Reynolds’ pioneer work on the 

pipe  flow  was  done  [1].  Reynolds  showed  via  experiments  that  a  nominally  laminar  pipe  flow 

 

1

 

 

 

would  display  turbulent  behaviour  when  the  Reynolds  number  exceeded  a  critical  value.  The 

physical mechanisms that cause laminar flow to lose its stability and transits to turbulence are still 

poorly understood [2-5]. From mathematical analysis, Lin [6] demonstrated that transition from 

laminar to turbulent flows is due to the occurrence of instability.  Emmons [7] found the turbulent 

spot for the first time in experiment for natural transition of a boundary layer. His measurement 

indicated that the turbulent spot is the initial stage of turbulent transition and it is specifically a 

local  phenomenon.  There  is  intermittence  at  the  edge  of  the  spot  surround  by  laminar  flow. 

Theodorsen  [8]  proposed  a  simple  vortex  model  as  the  central  element  of  the  turbulence 

generation in shear flows. It takes the form of a hairpin (or horseshoe)-shaped vertical structure 

inclined in the direction of mean shear.  Kline et al [9] found the detailed coherent structure in the 

flow  of  a  boundary  layer  that  turbulence  consists  of  a  series  of  hairpin  vortices.    These 

phenomena  have  been  confirmed  by  later  simulations  and  experiments  [10-12].  However,  the 

challenge remains to identify the mechanisms of the formation of velocity inflection and the lift 

and breakdown, of hairpin vortices. On the other hand, for Poiseuille flow in a straight pipe and 

plane  Couette  flow,  linear  stability  analysis  shows  that  they  are  stable  for  all  the  range  of 

Reynolds number while they both transit to turbulence at finite Reynolds number in experiments 

[2-5].  Now,  it  is  generally  accepted  from  experiments  that  there  is  a  critical  Reynolds  number 

cRe  below which no turbulence can be produced regardless of the level of imposed disturbance. 

From  experiments  the  critical  value  of  the  Reynolds  number  (

cRe )  for  pipe  Poiseuille  flow  is 

approximately 2000 [13]. Above this critical value, the transition to turbulence depends to a large 

extent  on  the  initial  disturbance  to  the  flow.  For  example,  experiments  showed  that  if  the 

disturbance in a laminar flow can be carefully reduced, the onset of turbulence can be delayed to 

Reynolds number up to Re=O(10⁵) [4, 5, 14]. Experiments also showed that for Re>

cRe , only 

when a threshold of disturbance amplitude is reached, can the flow transition to turbulence occur 

[15].  Trefethen et al. suggested that the critical amplitude of the disturbance leading to transition 

 

2

varies  broadly  with  the  Reynolds  number  and  is  associated  with  an  exponent  rule  of  the  form, 

γRe∝A

 [4]. The magnitude of this exponent has significant implication for turbulence research 

[4, 5].  Waleffe [16], based his analysis on available analytical and numerical data, and claimed 

that for Couette flow the exponent is near to -1. Chapman, through a formal asymptotic analysis 

of the Navier-Stokes equations (for Re → ∞ ), found γ = −3/2 and -5/4 for plane Poiseuille flow 

with  streamwise  mode  and  oblique  mode,  respectively,  with  generating  a  secondary  instability, 

and γ = −1 for plane Couette flow with above both modes. He also examined the boot-strapping 

route to transition without needing to generate a secondary instability, and found γ = −1 for both 

plane  Poiseuille  flow  and  plane  Couette  flow  [17].    Recently,  Hof  et  al.  [18],  used  pulsed 

disturbances  in  experiments,  to  have  obtained  the  normalized  disturbance  flow  rate  in  the  pipe, 

and found it to be inversely proportional to the Re number, i.e., 

1−=γ

. The physical mechanism 

of this result has not been explained so far. 

 

Recently, Dou [19] suggested a new approach to analyze flow instability and turbulence 

transition based on the energy gradient concept. He proposed a function of energy gradient and 

then took the maximum of this function in the flow field, Kmax, as the criterion for flow instability. 

This  approach  obtains  a  consistent  value  of  Kmax  for  the  critical  condition  (i.e.,  minimum 

Reynolds number) of turbulent transition in plane Poiseuille flow, pipe Poiseuille flow and plane 

Couette  flow  [19,  20].  For  flows  of  Kmax  below  this  value  no  turbulence  can  be  generated  no 

matter  how  large  of  the  disturbance  amplitude.  However,  the  detail  of  amplification  of  the 

disturbance by the energy gradient has not been described. 

 

In this paper, based on the analysis of disturbance of the fluid particle in shear flows, a 

theory with support of detailed physical background for flow instability and turbulent transition is 

proposed.  We  name  the  proposed  theory  “Energy  Gradient  Theory.”  With  this  theory,  the 

mechanism of amplification or decay of a disturbance in shear flows is elucidated. A formulation 

 

3

for the scaling of normalized amplitude of disturbance is obtained. Following that, the theory is 

compared to the published experimental results of others.  

2. Energy Gradient Theory  

In this section, we will use the theory of Brownian motion to analyze the energy variation 

of a perturbed particle and to obtain the criterion for flow instability.  

In  mechanics,  instability  means  that  a  system  may  leave  its  original  rest  state  when 

disturbed. Transition means that a flow state has changed from laminar to turbulent. It is not yet 

clear exactly how transition is related to stability [21]. Linear theory only describes the stability 

of a system that has undergone an infinitesimal disturbance. In nature, a mechanical system may 

be stable to infinitesimal disturbance (linear stability), but can still be unstable when a sufficiently 

large  disturbance  with  finite  amplitude  (nonlinear  unstable),  as  shown  in  Fig.1.  Three  simple 

cases are demonstrated in Fig.1a to Fig.1c; a smooth ball lies at rest under stable (1a), unstable 

(1b) and neutral stable conditions (1c).  A more complicated case is illustrated in Fig.1d, where 

the ball is stable for small displacement but will diverge if the disturbance is larger than a finite 

threshold. In fluid flow, the situation of stability is more complicated. But, we can understand it 

better by referring to these simple cases of stability problems in principle.  

From the classical theory of Brownian motion, the microscopic particles suspended in a 

fluid  are  in  a  state  of  thermally  driven,  random  motion  [22].    The  fluid  particles  exchange 

momentum  and  energy  via  collisions.    Fig.  2  demonstrates  the  transport  of  momentum  through 

the layers in parallel shear flow. Particles on neighboring layers collide, resulting in an exchange 

of momentum. The viscous nature of the fluids considered here, results in inelastic collision and 

an associated dissipation of energy.  In the flow, this energy loss due to viscosity leads to the drop 

of  total  energy  along  the  streamline.  Meanwhile,  there  is  an  energy  gradient  in  transverse 

direction in shear flows. The variations of energy in transverse and streamwise directions might

make the disturbed particle leave its equilibrium position and forms the source (genesis) of flow 

instability.  

Firstly, let us consider a fluid particle in the middle layer (Fig.2).  This particle acquires 

energy  from  the  upper  layer  through  momentum  exchange  (inelastic  collisions)  which  is 

expressed  as 

1EΔ .  Simultaneously,  this  particle  releases  energy  to  the  lower  layer  through 

momentum exchange which is expressed as 

2EΔ .  The net energy obtained by this particle from 

the upper and lower layer is 

Δ−Δ=Δ

.  There is energy loss due to viscosity friction 

on  the  two  interfaces,  and  this  energy  loss  is  expressed  as  HΔ ( HΔ >0).      For  steady  laminar 

flow,

(2) 

Thus, the flow of this particle is in an equilibrium state.   If  the  particle  is  subjected  to  a  vertical 

and there is possibility of instability. If the particle can return its original streamline, it was in a 

stable  equilibrium,  and  if  it  cannot,  the  particle  was  in  an  unstable  equilibrium.  For  a  minute 

displacement of the particle to the upper layer, there is 

0>Δ−Δ

minute displacement of the particle to the lower layer, there is

In Fig.2, we express that the kinetic energy of this particle in steady flow is

'u represent  the  velocity  before

that the kinetic energy of the particle will increase after being subjected to this disturbance. For

.  This means that the disturbance has resulted in a loss of kinetic energy 

for  the  particle..    From  these  discussions,  it  is  seen  that  the  stability  of  a  flow  depends  on  the 

relative magnitude of  EΔ and  HΔ . 

Then,  secondly,  let  us  consider  the  elastic  collision  of  particles  when  a  disturbance  is 

imposed to the base of a parallel shear flow (Fig.3). Let us consider that a fluid particle  P  at its 

equilibrium  position  will  move  a  cycle  in  vertical  direction  under  a  vertical  disturbance,  and  it 

will  have  two  collisions  with  two  particles  (

1P  and 2P )  at  its  maximum  disturbance  distances, 

respectively.  The  masses  of  the  three  particles  are  m , 

1m and 

2m ,  and  the  corresponding 

velocities  prior  to  collisions  are  u , 

1u and 

2u .  We  use  primes  for  the  corresponding  quantities 

after  collision.  Without  lose  of  generality,  we  may  assume  m = 1m = 2m  for  convenience  of  the 

derivation.  For a cycle of disturbances, the fluid particle may absorb energy by collision in the 

first half-period and it may release energy in the second half-period because of the gradient of the 

velocity  profile.  The  total  momentum  and  kinetic  energy  are  conserved  during  the  elastic 

collisions. The conservation equations for the first collision on streamline

Here 

1α  and 

1β  are two constants and 

1α ≤ 1 and 

1β ≤ 1. The values of 

1α and 

1β  are related to 

the  residence  time  of  the  particle  at 

1P .  If  the  residence  time  at  position 

1P  is  sufficiently  long 

(e.g. whole half-period of disturbance), the particle P would have undergone a large number of  

collisions with other particles on this streamline and would have the same momentum and kinetic 

energy as those on the line of 

1S , and it is required that 

1α =1 and 

1β =1. In this case, the energy

gained by particle P in the half-period is 

. When the particle P  remains on S1

Here 

2α  and 

2β  are  two  constants  and 

2α ≥ 1  and 

2β ≥ 1.  Similar  to  the  first  collision, 

2α and 

2β  are related to the residence time for P at P2. Similarly, 

2α =1 and 

2β =1, when the residence 

time is equal to the half-period of the disturbance. For the second collision, the energy gained by 

particle P in a half-period is 

 (the value is negative). The energy gained by a

For  the  first  half-period,  the  particle  gains  energy  by  the  collision  and  the  particle  also 

releases  energy  by  collision  in  the  second  half-period.  For  the  first  half  cycle  of  the  particle 

movement,  the  energy  gained  per  unit  volume  of  fluid  is

In Equation (9),

The selection of the disturbance function in Eq.(10) does not affect the result of Eq.(12), except 

there may be a difference of a proportional constant. In a similar way, for the second half cycle, a 

complete similar equation to Eq.(12) can be obtained for the released energy.  

Due  to  the  viscosity  of  the  fluid,  the  particle-particle  collisions  are  more  properly 

characterized  as  being  inelastic.  Shear  stress  is  generated  at  the  interface  of  fluid  layers  via 

momentum exchange among fluid particles, which results in energy loss. The disturbed particle is 

also subjected to this energy loss in a half cycle. Thus, the kinetic energy gained by a particle in a 

half-period  is  less  than  that  represented  by  Eq.(12).  The  magnitude  of  the  reduced  part  of  the 

gained kinetic energy is related to the shear stress as well as the energy loss (see Eq.(2)).   

The  stability  of  the  particle  can  be  related  to  the  energy  gained  by  the  particle  through 

vertical  disturbance  and  the  energy  loss  due  to  viscosity  along  streamline  in  a  half-period.  It  is 

now left to use to calculate the energy loss due to viscosity in a half-period in the following.  In 

the half-period, the particle moves a short distance of  l  along a streamline, thus it has an energy

loss per unit volume of fluid along the streamline,  (

Now, we discuss how a particle loses its stability by comparing the terms:  EΔ  and  HΔ . After 

the particle moves a half cycle, if the net energy gained by collisions is zero, this particle will stay 

in  its  original  equilibrium  position  (streamline).  If  the  net  energy  gained  by  collisions  is  larger 

than zero, this particle will be able to move into equilibrium with a higher energy state.  If the 

collision  in  a  half-period  results  in  a  drop  of  kinetic  energy,  the  particle  can  move  into  lower 

energy  equilibrium.  However,  there  is  a  critical  value  of  energy  increment  which  is  balanced 

(damped) by the energy loss due to viscosity (see Eq.(2) and the discussion). This critical value is 

determined by the energy difference of fluid particles between neighbor streamlines which must 

be  described  by  micro-thermodynamics.    Only  when  the  energy  increment  accumulated  by  the 

particle exceeds this energy difference, could the particle migrate to its neighbor streamline and 

its  equilibrium  will  become  unstable  (we  can  understand  better  with  reference  to  Fig.1d).    The 

energy difference between the streamlines forms the disturbance threshold.  Therefore, if the net 

energy gained by collisions is less than this critical amount, the disturbance will be damped by 

the  viscous  forces  of  the  fluid  and  this  particle  will  still  stay  (return)  to  its  original  location 

(Fig.4a). If the net energy gained by collisions is larger than this critical amount, this particle will 

become  unstable  and  move  up  to  neighboring  streamline  with  higher  kinetic  energy  (Fig.4b).  

Similarly, in the second half-period, if the energy released by collision is not zero, this particle 

will  try  to  move  to  a  streamline  of  lower  kinetic  energy.    If  the  energy  released  by  collision  is 

larger than the critical amount, this particle becomes unstable and moves to a equilibrium position 

of lesser energy (Fig.4c).  If the energy increments in both of the half-periods exceed the critical 

value, the particle would oscillate about the original equilibrium and a disturbance wave would be 

generated.  This  describes  how  a  particle  loses  its  stability  and  how  the  instability  occurs.  A 

continuous  cycle  of  particle  movement  will  lead  to  the  particle  to  gradually  deviate  from  its 

original location, thus an amplification of disturbance will be generated.  Since linear instability is 

 

10

 

 

only associated with infinitesimal disturbance amplitude, it is clear from the discussion here that 

it is the nonlinearity of the disturbance with finite amplitude that acts as a source for instability 

As discussed above, the relative magnitude of the energy gained from collision and the 

energy loss due to viscous friction determines the disturbance amplification or decay. Thus, for a 

given flow, a stability criterion can be written as below for the half-period, by using Eq.(12) and

Here,  F  is  a  function  of  coordinates  which  expresses  the  ratio  of  the  energy  gained  in  a  half-

period by the particle and the energy loss due to viscosity in the half-period. K is a dimensionless 

field variable/function and expresses the ratio of transversal energy gradient and the rate of the 

energy loss along the streamline. 

It can be found from Eq.(14) that the instability of a flow depends on the values of K and 

the amplitude of the relative disturbance velocity 

. The magnitude of K is proportional to 

v m'

u

the  global  Reynolds  number  (to  be  detailed  later).  Thus,  it  can  be  seen  from  Eq.(15)  that  F 

increases with Re. The maximum of F in the field will reaches its critical value with the increase 

of Re.  The critical value of F indicates the onset of instability in the flow at this location and the 

flow transitions to turbulence. Therefore, at the onset of turbulence, the transition from laminar to 

turbulent flows is a local phenomenon. It is not surprising that a turbulence spot can be observed 

early in the transition process. Experiment confirmed that the turbulent spot is actually a localized 

turbulence  phenomenon  which  is  resulted  from  the  hairpin  vortices.  As  observed  from 

 

 

 

11

experiments, a small region of turbulence is generated in the flow at a relatively low Re number, 

while the turbulence is generated in the full domain at a high Re [2,3].

 is  the  normalized  amplitude  of  the  velocity 

disturbance.   

If the Re is sufficiently small (e.g., Re<2000 for pipe Poiseuille flow), the energy gained 

by the disturbed particle in a half-period is similarly small. Even if the disturbance amplitude is 

large, the particle still cannot accumulate enough energy for the stability criterion of the particle 

(F in Eq (14)) to exceed the critical number. Therefore, it can be found from Eq.(14) that there 

exists  a  critical  value  of  the  non-dimensional  field  variable  K  below  which  the  flow  remains 

laminar  always.  The  critical  value  of  K  is  decided  by  its  maximum  (Kmax)  in  the  domain.  This 

critical value for Kmax is related to the critical Reynolds number for the onset of turbulence. For 

situations where Kmax is below this critical value, all the energy gained by collision is damped (by 

viscous  interaction)  and  the  flow  is  stable,  independent  of  magnitude  of  the  normalized 

disturbance. For a parallel flow, the fluid particles flow along straight streamlines and the energy 

gradient only involves kinetic energy.  Thus, the critical value of Kmax should be a constant for all 

parallel flows.  From these discussions, the physical implication of the critical Reynolds number 

for turbulence transition can be further understood. The critical Reynolds number is the minimum 

Re,  below  which  the  disturbed  particle  could  not  accumulate  sufficient  energy  to  leave  its 

equilibrium state because the energy loss due to viscosity is large.  

For pressure driven flows, the energy loss due to viscosity along the streamline equals to 

the  magnitude  of  the  energy  gradient  along  the  streamline.  Thus,  for  this  case,  the  function  K 

expresses  the  ratio  between  the  energy  gradient  in  the  transverse  direction  and  that  in  the 

streamwise direction. If there is an inflection point on the velocity profile, the energy loss at this 

point is zero. The value of function K becomes infinite at this point and indicates that the flow is 

unstable when it is subjected to a finite disturbance (see Eq.(14)).

3. Comparison with Experiments and Discussions 

(1) Mechanism of turbulence transition event 

It  is  well  known  that  there  is  a  coherent  structure  in  developed  turbulence  [11].  This 

coherent structure consists of a series of hairpin vortices with scale of the same order as the flow 

geometry. This form of a hairpin (or horseshoe)-shaped vertical structure has been confirmed by 

extensive  experiments  and  simulations  [12,  13],  as  shown  in  Fig.5.  Both  simulations  and 

experiments showed that the development of the hairpin vortex in boundary layer flows will lead 

to  the  formation  of  the  young  turbulent  spot  [12,  23],  which  will  result  in  the  evolution  of 

developed turbulent flow when Re is high.  In the process of turbulence generation, two bursting 

phenomena, namely, an ejection and a sweep (or in-rush), are generated, the former refers to the 

ejection  of  low-speed  fluid  from  the  wall,  while  the  latter  means  the  impinging  of  high-speed 

flow  towards  the  wall.  However,  the  mechanisms  of  these  phenomena  are  still  not  well 

understood.  In  present  theory,  the  generation  of  turbulence  in  shear  flows  can  be  explained  as 

follows: When a disturbance is imposed to the base flow, the fluid particle gains energy via the 

interaction of the disturbance in the transverse direction and the energy gradient of the base flow 

in transverse direction. If the energy variation in the cycle is much larger than the energy loss due 

to viscous friction and the criterion in Eq.(14) is violated, instability will occur and the particle 

will move to a new equilibrium position, with an energy state that depends upon the result of the 

disturbance  cycle  on  the  particle.    If  the  particle  gains  energy  during  the  complete  cycle  of  the 

disturbance,  this  particle  moves  to  higher  energy  position  (upward,  Fig.4b),  coinciding  with  a 

higher energy state. After a continuous migration upward of the fluid particle, an inflection point 

on  the  velocity  profile  will  be  produced.  Further  downstream,  a  continuous  interaction  of  the 

particle and the transverse energy gradient could lead to the lift of vortex roll and the formation of 

hairpin vortex (Fig.5), which will results in a bursting (ejection) and the appearance of the young 

turbulent spot. As is well known, the appearance of the turbulent spot is the primary stage of the 

 

14

generation  of  turbulence  [24].  When  the  particle  releases  energy  during  the  whole  cycle  (total 

energy increment is negative except viscous loss), this particle will move downward in the flow 

(Fig.4c),  to  a  position  with  lower  energy.  In  this  case,  the  so  called  sweep  (or  in-rush)  will  be 

generated after a continuous migration. Although the hairpin vortex structure was first found in 

boundary  layer  flows,  hairpin-vortex  packets  are  also  found  in  other  wall-bounded  shear  flows 

[24].    

Jimenez  and  Pinelli  [25]  used  numerical  simulations  to  demonstrate  that  a  self-

conservation cycle exists which is local to the near-wall region and does not depend on the outer 

flow for wall bounded turbulence. Waleffe [16] also discovered a similar mechanism via detailed 

mathematical analysis. However, what  mechanism should provide the power to drive this cycle 

which is independent of the outer flow?  The present theory explains that the transversal energy 

gradient plays the part of the source of the disturbance amplification and transfers the energy to 

the disturbance via the interaction. With a similar way as in [19],applying Eq.(15) to the boundary 

layer flow and calculating the distribution of K, it is easy to find that the position of Kmax is very 

near the wall for the flow of Blasius boundary layer (within 1/10 of the thickness of the boundary 

layer). This is why the turbulence is always generated near the wall for boundary layer flow [9, 

10]. In comparison, the position of Kmax in pipe Poiseuille flow is at r/R=0.58 [19]. 

 

For boundary layer flow, the transverse velocity is not zero (not exactly parallel flow). At 

a  higher  Re,  the  generation  of  linear  instability  leads  to  propagating  of  Tollmien-Schlichting 

waves  and  the  formation  of  streamwise  streaks  as  well  as  appearance  of  streamwise  vortices. 

These  streamwise  vortices  make  the  streamwise  velocity  periodically  “inflectional”  and 

“swollen”  along  the  spanwise  direction.    At  such  background,  the  nonlinear  interaction  of 

disturbed  particles  with  transversal  energy  gradient  will  lead  to  the  “ejection”  at  the  inflection 

side and the “sweep” at the swollen side. The dominating factors to lead to turbulence transition 

and  those  to  sustain  a  turbulence  flow  should  be  the  same.  Thus,  these  phenomena  may  also 

 

15

provide a mechanism for the self-sustaining process  of wall bounded turbulence. The nonlinear 

interaction of disturbed particles with energy gradient continuously supplies the energy from the 

mean flow to the vortex motion.   

 (2) Threshold amplitude of disturbance scaled with Re 

Many  researchers  have  investigated  the  scaling  relationship  between  the  threshold 

amplitude of the disturbance and the Reynolds number (Re) [4-5, 16-17]. Recently, Hof et al [18] 

repeated the experiment of pipe flow done 120 years ago by Reynolds [1] with detailed care of 

control.  It  was  found  that  the  scaling  is  well  fitted  by  an  exponent  -1,  i.e., 

'(
m Uv
/

)

c

 inversely 

proportional with  Re.    The  mechanism  of  this  phenomenon  has  not  been  explained  so  far.  One 

can  find  that  the  result  in  the  present  study  (Eq.(18)), 

'(
m Uv
/

)

c

~

1Re − ,  obtains  exactly 

agreement with the experiments of Hof et al [18] and therefore the present theory well explains 

the physics of scaling law derived from their experimental data.   

 

The  physical  mechanism  of  the  effect  of  disturbance  amplitude  on  the  stability  can  be 

concisely  explained  by  the  present  theory.  In  the  first  half-period  of  the  disturbance  cycle  at  a 

given Re, if the amplitude of disturbance is large, the particle could gain more energy because it 

can exchange energy with particles with higher kinetic energy.  However, the viscous energy loss 

may not increase (for example, the energy loss is constant for the whole flow field in simple pipe 

and  plane  Poiseuille  flows  [19]  which  equals  to  the  pressure  drop  per  unit  length).  Thus,  the 

energy gained in the cycle will be much larger than the energy loss, which leads to the flow being 

more unstable.  Similarly, in the second half-period of the disturbance cycle, if the amplitude of 

disturbance  is  large  at  a  given  Re  (say,  exceeds  the  value  expressed  by  Eq.(19)),    the  particle 

could  release  more  energy  because  it  can  exchange  energy  with  particles  with  lower  kinetic 

energy.  However, as stated above, the magnitude of the energy loss may not change much.  Thus, 

 

16

the  energy  released  can  reach  its  threshold  expressed  by  Eq.(19)  for  instability  occurrence  at 

lower Re.  

(3) Critical value of Kmax for turbulent transition 

It is mentioned in previous section that the critical value of K in Eq. (14) is decided by its 

maximum (Kmax) in the field and should be a constant for parallel shear flows. The values of Kmax 

at the critical condition determined by experiments for various types of flows are shown in Table 

1  [19].  It  is  seen  that  the  critical  value  of    Kmax  for  all  the  three  types  of  flows  fall  within  in  a 

narrow range of 370~389.  These data strongly support the proposed theory in present study and 

the claim that the critical value of Kmax is constant for all parallel flows, as discussed before.

[26], Daviaud et al [27], and Malerud et al [28]. Here, two Reynolds numbers are used since both 
definitions are employed in literature. 

370 

Recently, a collaboration research by mathematician and physicist from USA and Europe 

has  shown  that  there  exist  unstable  traveling  waves  with  computational  studies  of  the  Navier-

Stokes  equations  and  ideas  from  dynamical  systems  theory  [29].  It  is  suggested  that  traveling 

waves  moving  through  the  fluid  at  different  speeds  might  be  responsible  for  the  onset  and 

sustenance of turbulence. These traveling wave solutions consist of streamwise swirls and streaks 

with rotational symmetry about the axis of the pipe. The outlines of these solutions of traveling 

 

17

waves seem to obtain good agreement with experimental observations in pipe flow. Hof et al. [29] 

suggested that the dynamics associated with these unstable states may indeed capture the nature 

of fluid turbulence. As discussed in [19], these traveling waves may be related to the instability 

resulting from the transverse energy gradient since the location of the kink (inflection of velocity 

profile)  on  the  velocity  profile  obtained  by  the  solution  of  traveling  waves  accords  with  the 

position of the maximum of the function K.   According to the present study, with the increase of 

Re,  the  oscillation  of  base  flow  should  start  first  from  the  position  of  Fmax,  see  Eq.(14).  If 

v m
'(

/

u

)

max

 does  not  vary  too  much  at  the  neighborhood  of  Fmax,  the  position  of  Kamx  coincide 

approximately  with  that  of  Fmax.  The  oscillation  of  base  flow  could  lead  to  secondary  flows 

around this position. The experiments  of Hof et al. [29]  showed that the streamwise vortices at 

Re=2000  (the  base  flow  is  still  laminar)  occur  at  about  r/R=0.5-0.6  (Fig.2(A)  in  [29]),  which 

accords with the present study that we found the maximum of K occurs at the ring of r/R=0.58 for 

pipe flow [19].  

Further  studies  for  Taylor-Couette  flow  between  concentric  rotating  cylinders  have 

confirmed that the proposed theory is also applicable to rotating flows [30]. This theory obtains 

very good agreement with the available experimental data in literature for this type of flows. For 

the occurrence of primary instability, the critical value of Kmax is a constant for a given geometry 

no  matter  how  the  rotating  speeds  of  the  two  cylinders  for  all  the  available  experiments.  The 

critical value of Kmax is observed from the experiments at the case of the inner cylinder rotating 

and the outer cylinder set to rest.   

4. Conclusions  

After analyzing the energy transfer process in perturbed shear flows we have developed a 

theory  for  flow  instability,  called  the  “Energy  Gradient  Theory”.  The  theory  proposes  that  in 

shear flows it is the transverse energy gradient interacting with a disturbance to lead to the flow 

 

18

instability,  while  the  energy  loss,  due  to  viscous  friction  along  the  streamline,  damps  the 

disturbance.  The  mechanisms  of  velocity  inflection and  formation  and  lift  of the  hairpin vortex 

are well explained with the analytical result; the disturbed particle exchanges energy with other 

particles  in  transverse  direction  during  the  cycle  and  causes  the  particle  leaves  its  equilibrium 

position. The threshold amplitude of disturbance for transition to turbulence is scaled with Re by 

an exponent of -1 in parallel flows, which explains the recent experimental result of pipe flow by 

Hof et al. [18]. The present study also confirms the results from asymptotic analysis (for Re → ∞ ) 

of the Navier-Stokes equations by Chapman for plane Couette flow with all the three modes, and 

for  plane  Poiseuille  flow  with  the  mode  without  generating  a  secondary  instability  [17]. 

Comparison with experiments on pipe Poiseuille flow, plane Poiseuille flow, and plane Couette 

flow  also  confirms  the  validation  of  the  present  theory,  and  the  critical  value  for  the  energy 

gradient parameter, Kamx, is about 380.  The physical implication of the critical Reynolds number 

for turbulence transition can then be reinterpreted from this result. Since the flow instability and 

the  initial  transition  to  turbulence  can  be  described  by  the  “Energy  Gradient  Theory,”  it  is 

reasonable  to  deduce  that  the  coherent  structure  in  developed  turbulence  is  dominated  by  the 

variation of energy gradient and energy loss. Furthermore, the turbulence could be controlled by 

manipulating the energy gradient and energy loss.

Abstract
We show that a left-rigid monoidal C ∗-category with irreducible monoidal unit
is also a sovereign and spherical category. Deﬁning a Frobenius--Schur type
indicator we obtain selection rules for the fusion coeﬃcients of irreducible
objects. As a main result we prove S4-invariance of 6j-symbols in such a
category.

1 Introduction

The quantities that are known as 6j-symbols or F -coeﬃcients appear in various disguises
in mathematics and physics, for instance as: recoupling coeﬃcients in the theory of groups
[1, 2, 3] and quantum groups [4], as (partially gauge-ﬁxed) fusing matrices [5, 6, 7] in
conformal ﬁeld theory, as the Boltzmann weights for triangulations of three-manifolds [8,
9,10,11] giving rise to topological lattice ﬁeld theories [11,12,13], as expansion coeﬃcients
of exchange algebra relations in the algebraic theory of superselection sectors [14], as
the components of the 3-cocycle in Ocneanu’s non-Abelian cohomology [15], as structure
constants in the theory of 3-algebras [16], as speciﬁc endomorphisms of a von Neumann
factor M in the theory of subfactors [17], and as components of the coassociator ϕ of a
rational Hopf algebra [18, 19, 20]. More generally, the F -coeﬃcients can be described as
the projections of the associativity constraint ϕ of a semisimple, rigid, monoidal category
onto irreducible objects hence they map a pair of basic intertwiner spaces to another pair.
The F -coeﬃcients depend on the choice of basis (gauge choices) in the basic intertwiner
spaces (spaces of 3-point functions).

An important property of the F -coeﬃcients is their ‘tetrahedral symmetry’, or more
precisely, the fact that the gauge freedom that is present in their deﬁnition can be ﬁxed in
such a way that they are invariant under a set of transformations which form the permuta-
tion group S4. This symmetry property is for example needed in three-dimensional lattice
theories in order for the partition function that is deﬁned in terms of the F -coeﬃcients
to be independent of the triangulation so that the theory is topological (see e.g. [21, 9]).
Other places where this symmetry plays an important rˆole are the derivation of identi-
ties for ‘higher order fusion coeﬃcients’ [22] and the construction of solutions to the ‘big
pentagon equation’ [23]. Also, in pursuing a project for ﬁnding (possibly with the aid
of computers) explicit solutions of the Moore--Seiberg polynomial equations for ‘small’
fusion rings the assumption of tetrahedral symmetry allows for the substantial increase in
the number of accessible fusion rings. (In conformal ﬁeld theory the explicit computation
of fusing matrices is e.g. required for the calculation of the operator product coeﬃcients.)
Let us remark that in conformal ﬁeld theory it seems to be common lore that the F -
coeﬃcients possess S4-invariance (see e.g. [7,24]); but as a matter of fact no complete and
detailed proof has ever been published. In the theory of subfactors it was realized that the
S4-symmetry follows from Frobenius reciprocity of intertwiners between bimodules [17],
and in algebraic ﬁeld theory the same aspects of the symmetry are implicit in the results
of [14] (see in particular the appendix of that paper). The Frobenius maps between
basic intertwiners generate the group S3, and the coherent choice of bases in the orbits
of this S3 group lead to S4-symmetric F -coeﬃcients. In [9] it was shown that in order
to have S4-symmetry one does not need a braiding – it is suﬃcient that the category
be spherical; however, in that paper the possibility of non-trivial Frobenius--Schur (FS)
indicators [25, 26, 27] was not considered.

In this paper we present a proof that in a left-rigid monoidal C ∗-category the F -
coeﬃcients possess S4-symmetry. We would like to emphasize two ﬁne points. The ﬁrst is
that, in general, due to the possibility of having non-trivial FS indicators, the Frobenius

2

maps provide only a Z2-projective representation of S3; but nevertheless the corresponding
signs cancel in the transformation of the F -coeﬃcients so that the F ’s are truly S4-
invariant. The second point is the following. The Frobenius transformations of order 3
map the basic intertwiners space (p × p, ˆp) into itself; hence its eigenvalues are third roots
of unity (here ˆp is the conjugate of the irreducible object p). When considering F ’s that
involve such intertwiner spaces, then in order to verify S4-invariance we must calculate
the diﬀerent transforms of F in diﬀerent bases of the space (p × p, ˆp). If, instead, we use
only a single basis in this space, then the transforms of F will possibly carry factors of
third roots of unity (this is illustrated on an example in the appendix).

Let us also brieﬂy mention a possible application of our results to the quest of explicitly
solving the polynomial equations for the braiding and fusing matrices, which constitutes
e.g. a part of the problem of classifying all rational conformal ﬁeld theories. Namely,
one expects that when the category is modular, then the trace of the braiding matrices
Rpp,q can be expressed completely in terms of the modular data, i.e. of the fusion rules,
the modular S matrix and balancing phases (in the case of doubles of ﬁnite groups this
was proved in [27]). Assuming that this expectation is indeed correct, it follows that the
Frobenius--Schur indicators as well as the multiplicities of the above-mentioned third roots
of unity do not constitute independent data, but are already determined uniquely by the
modular data. In particular, one can immediately write down all the F -coeﬃcients for
which at least one line is colored by the unit object as well as the R-coeﬃcients. In fact,
there are further special F -coeﬃcients that can easily be solved for. Finally, our results
concerning the S4-symmetry allow to reduce the number of unknowns in the polynomial
equations drastically, namely for generic F -coeﬃcients by a factor of 24. 1

2 Rigid monoidal C ∗-categories with irreducible mo-

noidal unit

Our starting point is a left-rigid monoidal C ∗-category (C; (ε, ×, {λ, ρ, ϕ}); (
, {e, c}); ∗)
with the restriction that the monoidal unit ε is irreducible. Here × is the monoidal
product and λa, ρa, ϕa,b,c with a, b, c ∈ Obj C are natural isomorphisms

b

λa: a → a × ε ,

ρa: a → ε × a ,

ϕa,b,c: a × (b × c) → (a × b) × c

that satisfy the triangle identity

and the pentagon identity

ϕa,ε,c = (λa × 1c) (1a × ρ−1

c ),

(2.1)

(2.2)

ϕa×b,c,d ϕa,b,c×d = (ϕa,b,c × 1d) ϕa,b×c,d (1a × ϕb,c,d) .

(2.3)
1 Further simpliﬁcations come from the action of simple currents on the F -coeﬃcients, which should
be derivable in a way similar to the S4-action. Moreover, one would expect the pentagon equation itself,
which can be regarded as the boundary of a 4-simplex, to possess S5-symmetry, just like the tetrahedra
(F -coeﬃcients) – the boundaries of 3-simplices – possess S4-symmetry.

The C ∗-property requires the arrows (the intertwiners)

(a, b) ≡ Hom (a, b) := {T : a → b}

(2.4)

between two objects a, b to form a complex Banach space. The ∗ is an involutive monoidal
contravariant functor acting as identity on the objects and antilinearly on the intertwiner
spaces. The norm of the intertwiners satisﬁes the C ∗-property, kT ∗T k = kT k2, and the
natural equivalences {λ, ρ, ϕ} are isometries. Irreducibility of ε implies that (ε, ε) = C · 1ε.
The left conjugation L: C → C is an antimonoidal contravariant (linear) functor, which
is the identity on the monoidal unit. The functor L is built up from a left rigidity structure
is the left conjugation on objects: ˆa ≡ L(a). The left evaluation and
(
coevaluation maps ea: ˆa × a → ε and ca: ε → a × ˆa, a ∈ Obj C satisfy the left rigidity

for every a ∈ Obj C ,

(2.7)

where ai ≡ Li(a) for i = 1, 2.

The C ∗-property allows us to deﬁne a right rigidity structure within C:

(R(a), eR

a , eL∗

a ) ≡ (ˆa, c∗

a, e∗

for a ∈ Obj C ,

(2.8)

leading to a right conjugate functor R: C → C similarly to (2.6):

(a, b) ∋ T 7→ R(T ) := λ∗

R(a) (1R(a) × eR
ˆa (1ˆa × c∗

(2.9)
Since the right and left conjugated objects are identical, R(a) = L(a) ≡ ˆa for all a ∈ Obj C,
the canonical natural isomorphisms

{κa: R(L(a)) → a} ,

{˜κa: L(R(a)) → a} ,

(2.10)

are given by

κa = λ∗
˜κa = ρ∗

using evaluation and coevaluation maps. In the special case b = c = ε these maps

(a, a) ∋ T 7→ ΦR

a (T ) := ea (1ˆa × T ) e∗
a (T ) := c∗

a ∈ (ε, ε) = C · 1ε
a (T × 1ˆa) ca ∈ (ε, ε) = C · 1ε

(a, a) ∋ T ∗T ≤ λ∗

for T ∈ (a, b) ,

(2.15)

it follows that End a ≡ (a, a) is ﬁnite-dimensional for every a ∈ Obj C; therefore C is
semisimple. We denote the subset of irreducible objects by I ⊂ Obj C.

Semisimplicity allows us to construct the so-called standard rigidity intertwiners [28],
leading to a left conjugation functor Ls among the equivalent ones (cf. (2.7)) that obeys
Ls = Rs by (2.8) and (2.9). This conjugation is achieved by the following procedure.

In the case of an irreducible object p ∈ I one uses the scalar freedom ep 7→ zpep, cp 7→

Then (
of {λ, ρ, ϕ} and (2.19), (2.20). The rigidity intertwiners (ea, ca) of an object a satisfying
(2.16) and (2.21) are called standard .

Now the corresponding right rigidity structure (cf. (2.8) and (2.9)) (

a}) leads
to a right conjugation functor R that is identical to the left conjugation L. As a matter

3 Sovereignty, traces and sphericity

We note that in case of standard rigidity intertwiners the choice ψa := 1ˆa for every
a ∈ Obj C leads to a natural equivalence ψ: R → L and makes C a sovereign category [29].
Indeed, ψε = 1ε and monoidality of ψ is clear, one has only to show the commutativity of
the sovereignty diagram, which reads in this case as κa = ˜κa. Since κ and ˜κ are natural
equivalences it is enough to show this equality for p ∈ I. But then one has

κ∗
pκp = xp1ˆˆp

and ˜κ∗

p˜κp = ˜xp1ˆˆp

for all p ∈ I ,

with xp, ˜xp ∈ R+ and xp = ˜x−1

p due to (2.12). Using (2.16) and rigidity one obtains

xpdˆp 1ε = eˆp (xp1ˆˆp × 1ˆp) e∗
˜xpdˆp 1ε = c∗

ˆp (1ˆp × ˜xp1ˆˆp) cˆp = c∗

ˆp = eˆp (κ∗

pκp × 1ˆp) e∗

ˆp = c∗

pcp = dp 1ε ,

ˆp (1ˆp × ˜κ∗

p˜κp) cˆp = epe∗

p = dp 1ε ,

6

(3.1)

(3.2)

which imply xp = ˜xp, hence xp = ˜xp = 1 and dˆp = dp. Then (3.1) and (2.12) lead to
the equalities ˜κp = κp, p ∈ I, of isometries. Owing to naturality the maps ˜κa ≡ κa: ˆˆa →
a, a ∈ Obj C, are isometries.

Having reached a standard conjugation, L = R, and sovereignty, let us consider the

conjugates of standard rigidity intertwiners. Using (2.26) one obtains

αˆa,aˆea = cˆa ∈ (ε, ˆa × ˆˆa) ,

ˆcaα−1

a,ˆa = eˆa ∈ (ˆˆa × ˆa, ε) ,

and the rigidity intertwiners of conjugated objects are related to the original ones as

eˆa = c∗

a (κa × 1ˆa) ,

cˆa = (1ˆa × κ−1

a ) e∗
a ,

(3.3)

(3.4)

as is seen by using (2.11) and (2.12). From (3.4) it follows that further speciﬁcation of
the rigidity intertwiners, e.g. identiﬁcation of the (ea, ca) and (c∗
ˆa) rigidity pairs, may
be achieved only in case of involutive conjugation, which will be discussed in Chapter 5.
: (a, a) →

In a sovereign monoidal category one can deﬁne left and right traces trL/R

(ε, ε) for each a ∈ Obj C:

trL

a (T ) := eL
a (T ) := eR

(3.5)

obeying the property

trR/L

(T S) = trR/L

(ST )

b

for all T ∈ (b, a), S ∈ (a, b) .

(3.6)

In the case of standard conjugation in a C ∗-category, together with the previously chosen
sovereignty maps, {ψa = 1ˆa}, these left (right) traces become identical to left (right)
inverses (2.14), hence they are positive traces. Moreover, due to standardness they are
equal:

trL

a (T ) = trR

a (T ) =: tra(T )

for all T ∈ (a, a) ;

(3.7)

hence C is also a spherical category [9].

4 Frobenius--Schur indicators

For any ﬁnite group G one deﬁnes the Frobenius--Schur element σ of the group algebra
CG as in [25], i.e. (up to normalization)

σ :=

1
|G|

g2 .

g∈G
X

The Frobenius--Schur element is a central selfadjoint element of CG; its central decompo-
sition reads

νr
dr

σ =

r∈I
X

with

νr =

0 for r 6= ˆr ,
±1 for r = ˆr ,

(cid:26)

7

(4.1)

(4.2)

where er, r ∈ I, are the minimal central projectors and dr = trr(er) is the (integral) di-
mension of the corresponding simple ideal of the group algebra CG. The three-valent
indicator νr that is deﬁned by (4.2) is the Frobenius--Schur indicator , which is zero on
non-selfconjugate simple ideals while on selfconjugate simple ideals the +(−) sign indi-
cates (pseudo)reality.

There is an extension of σ for C ∗-Hopf [30] or weak C ∗-Hopf algebras [23], which is

obtained using the Haar integral h ∈ H of the (weak) C ∗-Hopf algebra H:

σ :=

h(1) h(2) ;

1
ǫ(1)

(4.3)

here we use Sweedler notation for the coproduct, i.e. h(1) ⊗ h(2) ≡ ∆(h), and 1 and ǫ are
the unit and the counit of H, respectively. Since weak C ∗-Hopf algebras contain C ∗-Hopf
algebras as special cases, we prove the property (4.2) for σ as deﬁned in (4.3) only for the
former case.

There is a unique positive g ∈ H [31] that implements the square of the antipode,
i.e. gxg−1 = S2(x) for all x ∈ H, and satisﬁes the normalization condition tr Dr(g) =
tr Dr(g−1) =: τr ∈ R+. Then S(g) = g−1 holds, and if the unit representation is irreducible
then τr = dr/ǫ(1). Using the properties [32]

h2 = h∗ = S(h) = h ,

h(1) ⊗ xh(2)y = S(x)h(1)S−1(y) ⊗ h(2)

for all x, y ∈ H (4.4)

There exists a purely categorical deﬁnition of the Frobenius--Schur indicator. Let C
be a category as in section 2 and p an irreducible object. If p is selfconjugate, then there
exists an invertible intertwiner Jp: p → ˆp. Let us deﬁne the self-intertwiner
νp := J −1
p

ˆJpκ−1
which is independent of the choice of Jp due to irreducibility of p and linearity of the
conjugation. Hence νp is an isometry, because an isometric Jp can be chosen. In order to
prove that even νp = ±1p holds, one ﬁrst computes that
p (J −1
p (νp) := c∗
ΦR
using (2.6) and (2.12). However, the rigidity intertwiners

p (νp × 1ˆp) cp = c∗

and c′

p = u∗

Therefore

p = ΦR

Deﬁning νp as the zero intertwiner for non-selfconjugate irreducible objects p, one can

obtain a natural map ν between the identity functors.

Since the representation category of a (pure weak) C ∗-Hopf algebra is a rigid monoidal
C ∗-category with irreducible unit object, the consistency of the Hopf algebraic and the
categorical deﬁnitions of the FS indicator requires that νp = dpDp(σ) for p ∈ I, where
Dp: H → End Vp is an irreducible representation of H. This is indeed the case: One
can use the natural equivalences λ, ρ, the standard rigidity intertwiners that were given
in [23], and the involutive conjugation on the objects D 7→ ˆD := DT ◦ S0 to arrive at
κD = 1D. Then for an irreducible selfconjugate object Dp the choice J ˆαα

for the matrix elements of the map Jp: Vp → ˆVp leads to the desired result.

5 Involutive conjugation

The existence of the natural isomorphism {κa: ˆˆa → a} suggests that a convenient choice
ˆˆa = a can be achieved. This requires, however, a further assumption on the category
C; namely, the cardinalities of the sets of objects in any two equivalence classes that are
related by conjugation must be equal. This quite harmless assumption will always hold
after adjoining, if necessary, new objects to C, and this procedure does not change the
category within equivalence.

Therefore from now on we assume that the object map a 7→ ˆa of our conjugation
functor is involutive, ˆˆa = a for all a ∈ Obj C, and that ˆa = a whenever ˆa ≃ a. It follows
that every choice of standard rigidity intertwiners leads to a conjugation functor L ≡ R
that is involutive on the arrows as well. As a matter of fact, for each T ∈ (a, b) we have
T LL = T LR = κ−1

b T κa = T .

Due to the involutivity of the conjugation, for irreducible objects p the natural iso-
morphism κp: ˆˆp = p → p becomes κp = χp1p with χp ∈ C and |χp| = 1. The question arises
whether the scalar χp that appears here has something to do with the Frobenius--Schur
indicator or it can be “gauged” away. The relations (3.4) now read as

eˆp = c∗
cˆp = (1ˆp × κ−1

p (κp × 1ˆp) = χp c∗
p ,
p e∗
p = χ−1
p ) e∗
Inserting p = ˆq in the ﬁrst equation, we obtain χˆqe∗
ˆˆq

q
map Jq: q → ˆq in the deﬁnition (4.12) of the FS indicator to be 1q, we obtain
q 1q) = χ−1

q, implying that χˆq = ¯χq ≡
. For selfconjugate irreducibles q = ˆq we obtain χq = ±1. In this case by choosing the

for all q ∈ I with q = ˆq .

q = 1q1q(χ−1

νq = J −1 ˆJκ−1

(5.2)

If p 6= ˆp for p ∈ I, then we can employ the freedom (2.24) so as to change the rigidity
intertwiners of one of the irreducible objects of the pair {p, ˆp}, let us say of ˆp:

ˆp := χ−1

Then e′

(5.3)

p , i.e. the coeﬃcients χ that are present in (5.1) are gauged

To summarize: after enlarging C appropriately, there exists a standard conjugation
functor that is involutive both on the objects and on the arrows and has the property
that for p ∈ I

eˆp = χp c∗

p e∗
cˆp = χ−1

6 Frobenius maps on basic intertwiner spaces

Let us call the space (p, q × r), for p, q, r ∈ I, a basic intertwiner space. It is a Hilbert
space with scalar product determined by

(t1, t2) 1p := t∗

1t2

for t1, t2 ∈ (p, q × r) .

(6.1)

10

We deﬁne two antilinear maps

by

x : (p, q × r) → (r, ˆq × p , )

y : (p, q × r) → (q, p × ˆr)

(6.2)

x(t) := (1ˆq × t∗) ϕ∗

ˆq,q,r (e∗

q × 1r) ρr

y(t) := (t∗ × 1ˆr) ϕ∗

q,r,ˆr (1q × cr) λr

and call them the Frobenius maps. These maps are antilinear isometries, i.e. for the scalar
product the formula

(x(t1), x(t2)) = (t2, t1) = (y(t1), y(t2))
(6.4)
holds due to the trace property (3.6). They generate a Z2-graded antilinear and projective
action of S3 on the basic intertwiner spaces. A Z2-graded antilinear action of a Z2-
graded group means linear (antilinear) action for even (odd) elements of the group. A
permutation group is naturally Z2-graded by distinguishing even and odd permutations.
Moreover, the Frobenius maps generate only a projective action since using (5.4) one
proves that

x2 = χq · id(p,q×r) ,

y2 = χr · id(p,q×r)

as well as

xyx = yxy: (p, q × r) → (ˆp, ˆr × ˆq) ,

(6.5)

(6.6)

which constitutes just a projective version of the deﬁning S3-relations for the transposi-
tions: σ12 ↔ x, σ23 ↔ y. In a generic case the Frobenius maps lead to an orbit of six
diﬀerent intertwiner spaces

Im(id) = (p, q × r) ,

Im(xy) = (ˆr, ˆp × q) ,

Im(x) = (r, ˆq × p) ,

Im(yx) = (ˆq, r × ˆp) ,

(6.7)

Im(y) = (q, p × ˆr),

Im(yxy) = (ˆp, ˆr × ˆq) .

It is easy to give the action of the Frobenius maps on canonical basic intertwiners
ρp ∈ (p, ε × p) and λp ∈ (p, p × ε), namely,

x(ρp) = ρp ,

y(ρp) =

cp ,

xy(ρp) = λˆp

(6.8)

and

x(λp) =

y(λp) = λp ,

yx(λp) = ρˆp .

Therefore they are not generic but length three orbits of S3 with a possible projective

There are other cases, too, where the orbits are not generic. Then we have a repre-

space. In the list below we present all the possible irreducible representations of the sta-
bilizer subgroups in the non-generic cases. In two cases we obtain certain restrictions on
fusion coeﬃcients.
1. q = ˆq, r = p 6= q : orbit = {(p, p × q), (q, ˆp × p), (ˆp, q × ˆp)} .
Therefore there is a Z2-graded antilinear (projective if χq = −1) representation of Z2 on
(p, p × q) generated by y. But an antilinear unitary is always of order 2, therefore this
intertwiner space is the null space if χq = −1, i.e. the corresponding fusion coeﬃcient
If χq = 1 we have a Z2-graded antilinear representation of Z2, and such
is N p
irreducible representations are unique up to unitary equivalence.

pq = 0.

2. q = r = ˆp 6= p : orbit = {(p, ˆp × ˆp), (ˆp, p × p)} .
Therefore there is a linear representation of Z3 on (p, ˆp × ˆp), generated by xy. One can
use an orthonormal basis in (p, ˆp × ˆp) in which the basis elements carry one of the three
possible (one-dimensional) irreducible representations of Z3. (A simple example is given
in the Appendix.)

3. q = r = p = ˆp : orbit = {(p, p × p)} .
Therefore there is a Z2-graded antilinear (projective if χp = −1) representation of S3 on
(p, p × p). Similarly to the ﬁrst case we have N p
If χp = 1 we get a
Z2-graded antilinear proper representation of S3. Such irreducible representations are
one-dimensional and can be labelled by the three possible irreducible representations
of Z3. One can use a basis in (p, p × p) where basis elements carry these irreducible
representations.

pp = 0 if χp = −1.

7 S4-transformed simplicial maps of a tetrahedron

Let us consider the following Hilbert space containing certain four-fold tensor products
of basic intertwiner spaces as orthogonal subspaces:

H ≡

Hs

:=

(p × q, u) ⊗ (u × r, t) ⊗ (v, q × r) ⊗ (t, p × v)

s
M

p,q,r,t,u,v∈I
M

p,q,r,t,u,v∈I
M

≡

(u, p × q)∗ ⊗ (t, u × r)∗ ⊗ (v, q × r) ⊗ (t, p × v) ,

(7.1)

where we put (u, p × q)∗ := {t∗ | t ∈ (u, p × q)}. Vectors in subspaces Hs of H that cor-
respond to a four-fold tensor product of basic intertwiner spaces can be labelled by the
two-dimensional simplicial complex of the boundary of a tetrahedron △3. More precisely,
there are simplicial maps

ν = (ν0, ν1, ν2) : ∂△3 → Hs

(7.2)

as follows. ν0 maps all vertices into one point thus the vertices of the tetrahedron remain
unlabelled. (Nontrivial ν0 is needed only in 2-categories which is out of the scope of the
present paper.) ν1 associates to each oriented edge of △3 an irreducible object from the

12

set of representants I. Thus the edges become labelled with I:

ν1(12) := p ,

ν1(14) := t ,

ν1(23) := q ,

ν1(13) := u ,

ν1(34) := r

, ν1(24) := v .

(7.3)

Edges with opposite orientation carry the conjugate objects, e.g., ν1(21) = ˆp.

To every element of a basic intertwiner space one can associate an oriented face by a

right hand rule: 2

The two possible orientations tell us whether we are in a basic intertwiner space (u, p × q)
or in its adjoint (u, p × q)∗ ≡ (p × q, u). Now the images of the faces of the tetrahedron
are deﬁned to be elements of basic intertwiner spaces:

ν2(123) := αu

ν2(134) := βt

ν2(234) := γv

ν2(124) := δt

pq ∈ (u, p × q) ≡ (ν1(13), ν1(12) × ν1(23)) ,
ur ∈ (t, u × r) ≡ (ν1(14), ν1(13) × ν1(34)) ,
qr ∈ (v, q × r) ≡ (ν1(24), ν1(23) × ν1(34)) ,
pv ∈ (t, p × v) ≡ (ν1(14), ν1(12) × ν1(24)) .

(7.4)

Permutation of the index set {1, 2, 3, 4} of the points of the tetrahedron deﬁnes, using

the Frobenius maps x, y, an S4-action on the maps ν: ∂△3 → Hs as follows:

(ντ )0 := ν0 ◦ τ ,

(ντ )1(ij) := ν1(τ (i), τ (j))

for all τ ∈ S4 and i, j ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4} .

(7.5)
The deﬁnition of the transforms of ν2 uses the Frobenius maps. Let τ12, τ23, τ34 denote
the generating transpositions of S4. Then

(ντ12)2(123) := x(ν2(123)) ,
(ντ12)2(134) := ν2(234) ,

(ντ12)2(234) := ν2(134) ,
(ντ12)2(124) := x(ν2(124)) ;

(7.6)

in other words, introducing the notation

Extending the maps in (7.8) antilinearly, one obtains an action of S4 on the Hilbert space
H in (7.1). The important property of this S4 action is the following:

Lemma. The above deﬁned action of the transpositions τ12, τ23, τ34 induces a
Z2-graded antilinear representation of S4 on H.

Proof. One has to check only the deﬁning relations of S4:

12 = τ 2
τ 2

23 = τ 2

34 = id ,

τ12τ23τ12 = τ23τ12τ23 ,

τ23τ34τ23 = τ34τ23τ34 .

Indeed one gets

23(α∗ ⊗ β∗ ⊗ γ ⊗ δ) = y2(α)∗ ⊗ β∗ ⊗ x2(γ) ⊗ δ = χ2

q · α∗ ⊗ β∗ ⊗ γ ⊗ δ = α∗ ⊗ β∗ ⊗ γ ⊗ δ ,
r · α∗ ⊗ β∗ ⊗ γ ⊗ δ = α∗ ⊗ β∗ ⊗ γ ⊗ δ ,

while

τ12τ23τ12(α∗ ⊗ β∗ ⊗ γ ⊗ δ) = xyx(α)∗ ⊗ x(β)∗ ⊗ x(δ) ⊗ x(γ)

= yxy(α)∗ ⊗ x(β)∗ ⊗ x(δ) ⊗ x(γ) = τ23τ12τ23(α∗ ⊗ β∗ ⊗ γ ⊗ δ) ,

Notice that although the Frobenius maps lead to a (Z2-graded antilinear) projective rep-
resentation of S3 on each basic intertwiner space, due to the fact that ∂△3 is a closed ori-
entable surface without boundary, the action of S4 on H is a proper (i.e., non-projective)
representation. As a matter of fact, according to (7.10), the Frobenius transformations
x2 and y2 that lead to the signs χ are always coming in pairs.

(In order not to overburden the picture, we do not indicate the maps λ, ρ, ϕ; due to

The action of τ ∈ S4 on Φ is the one induced by the action on H,

(τ Φ)(α∗

⊗β∗

⊗γ⊗δ) := Φ(τ −1(α∗⊗β∗⊗γ⊗δ))

degτ

,

where the notation “overline to the power of deg τ ” means complex conjugation for odd
S4-elements and the identity operation for even elements. This transformation property
is required by the linearity of Φ and the antilinearity of S4 on H to be compatible:

(τ Φ)(λX) = Φ(τ −1(λX))

degτ

= ¯λdegτ Φ(τ −1(X))

It is suﬃcient to show this property for the generators of S4. Below there is
a diagrammatic proof where we used the deﬁnitions of the Frobenius maps, the trace
property, rigidity, the property End ε = C · 1ε and sphericity in the last series of pictures. 3

parametrizes the three diﬀerent rational Hopf algebras, while in all three cases one has
ωpqr = 1 for all other combinations of indices.

The representation category Rep H is a rigid monoidal C ∗-category. The irreducible
representations Dp, p = 0, 1, 2 are one-dimensional and obey Dp(eq) = δp,q. The basic
intertwiner spaces are one-dimensional at most, and we can choose (p, q × r) = C · 1p
qr
for the non-trivial ones, where 1p
qr maps the tensor product of the chosen unit vectors
into the chosen unit vector of the corresponding one-dimensional representation spaces,
i.e. 1p
qr(vq ⊗ vr) = vp. The natural isometries connected to monoidality and the standard
rigidity intertwiners are given by

λp = 1p

p0 ,

ρp = 1p

0p ,

ϕp,q,r = (Dp ⊗ Dq ⊗ Dr)(ϕ) ,

ep = 10∗
ˆpp ,

cp = 10

pˆp .

The values of χ (5.4) are all trivial: χp = 1 for p = 0, 1, 2. Using the deﬁnitions (6.3) of
the Frobenius maps, one obtains

x(1p

qr) = ¯ωˆqqr 1r

ˆqp ,

y(1p

qr) = ωqrˆr 1q

pˆr ,

with ωpqr as in (A.4). In the case (p, q × r) = (1, 2 × 2), this leads to

xy(11

22) = ω · 11

22 ,

which serve as examples of a degenerate orbit of type 2 in section 6 with the possible
third roots of unity.

The S4-symmetry is valid in a non-trivial way in the following sense. First note that
pv) that have

there are ﬁve S4-orbits of normalized F -coeﬃcients ˘F (pqr)t
the elements (only their pqr edges indicated):

(A.9)

{101, 011, 110, 202, 022, 220, 111, 222, 112, 122, 221, 211} ,

respectively, together with their complex conjugated quantities. One can easily compute
the ﬁrst normalized F -coeﬃcient of the ﬁfth orbit:

⊗ 12∗

(A.10)

then due to the S4-invariance one deduces that the other coeﬃcients in the same orbit
have the value 1, too. Computation of the τ12-transformed quantity

1 = τ12( ˘F (101)2

then shows that one may not have S4-invariance for a ﬁxed set of basic intertwiners in
general, so it is important to take the action of the Frobenius maps into account. In this
in the case of ω 6= 1 there is no
example even the following stronger statement holds:
such choice for the set of orthonormal basic intertwiners, {bq×r
| q, r = 0, 1, 2}
qr
with arbitrary but ﬁxed values of ωqr ∈ C,
|ωqr| = 1, that leads to a constant value of
normalized F -coeﬃcients within the chosen set of intertwiners. Indeed, the relation

implies that the common value should be ±1, but then the product of the τ12τ34- and
τ23τ34τ12τ23-transformed F -coeﬃcients leads to the contradiction

We also note that for a non-trivial third root of unity, ω 6= 1, there are no solutions of
the hexagon equations, that is Rep H cannot be made into a braided category in those
cases.

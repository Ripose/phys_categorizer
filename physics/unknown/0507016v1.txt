Abstract. We extend the results presented by Weinstein1concerning the measurement of 
the length of a moving rod by a single observer,  without making assumptions concerning 
the distance between the moving rod and the observer who measures its length. 
 
1. Who measures what? 
 
 
Weinstein1 considers a rod of proper length L0 at rest in the K’(X’O’Y’) reference 
 
frame. It is parallel to the O’X’ axis, positioned apart from it at a distance h (Figure 1). 
 located at the origin O’ and at rest relative to K’ measures its proper

length  L0.  Let 

be  the  leading  edge  of  the  rod  and 

 its trailing edge. Observer 

 detects the light signals 

from both ends of the rod at a single time

. Light originating from end 2’ has left it 

at 

  whereas  light  originating  from  1’  has  left  it  at  a  time

.  The  events 

involved 

in 

the 

length  measurement  by 

  are 

 

and

.  Consider  the  same  experiment  from  the  K(XOY) 

reference    frame.  The  axes  of  the  two  reference  frames  are  parallel  to  each  other,  the 
OX(O’X’) axes are common, and  K’ moves with constant velocity V relative to K in the 
positive  direction  of  the  common  axes.  What  we  compare  are  the  length  L  of  the  rod 
measured  in  K  and  its  proper  length  L0  measured  in  K’.  The  final  results  presented  by 
Weinstein1 are the consequence of some assumptions concerning how big or how small is 
”. The purpose of our paper is to present results free of 
the length of the position vector
such an assumption.

 We present in Figure 2 the variation of

Intersecting  the  corresponding  curves  with

, 

  and 

  we 

determine the values of 

 for which we detect Lorentz contraction, no change in length 

and Lorentz dilation respectively. For high values of

, the curves account for (15). 

 
The basic reason that Lorentz-contraction and Lorentz-dilation appear in this case 
and not in the case discussed by Terrell2 is that the length of the rod is here determined 
partly  from  angle  measurements  and  partly  from  time  of  propagation  of  light 
measurement. 
Sherwin3 considers the presentation of the Lorentz contraction on a pulsed radar 
 
system. A source of light at rest in K’ and located at its origin O’ emits light signals in all 
directions  of  the  X’O’Y’  plane.  Two  of  them  detect  the  ends  of  the  rod  generally  at 
different times and that enables a single observer to determine the radar measured length 
of the rod. In order to recover Sherwin’s results we change the sign of 
 in the equations 
derived above (the light signals are in this case “outgoing”). 
2. Conclusions 
 
 
The  reality  of  the  Lorentz-contraction  and  Lorentz-dilation  revealed  above 
consists  in  the  fact  that  they  are  the  result  of  measurements  and  of  the  fact  that  Nature 
prevents  us  from  results  that  would  violate  the  sacrosanct  principle  of  relativity.  They 
convince  us  that  when  we  speak  about  the  magnitude  of  a  physical  quantity  we  should 
mention the observer (the observers) who measures it, when and where the measurements 
are performed and the measuring devices they use.

A rod of proper length L0  is at rest in the K’(X’O’Y’) reference frame and located at a 
distance h  from the O’X’ axis, parallel to it. An observer 
located at the origin O’ 
measures its length by receiving at t’=0 light signals that have left the edges of the rod at 
different times.

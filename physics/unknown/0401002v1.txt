Abstract 

In this paper we examine the Maxwell Demon problem from an information 
theoretic and computational point-of-view. In particular we calculate the required 
capacity of a communication channel that transports information to and from the 
Demon. Equivalently, this is the number of bits required to store the information on 
a computer tape. We show that, in a simple model for the Maxwell Demon, the 
entropy of the universe increases by at least an amount 
η≈
an amount 
another sorted state.

1.  Introduction 

In this paper we address an old question that originated with Maxwell nearly 140 years 
ago and can be stated simply as “Can measurement and intelligence overcome the 
tyranny of the Second Law of Thermodynamics?” Maxwell imagined an intelligent 
microscopic “Demon” who could separate fast particles from slow particles in a box, thus 
creating a temperature gradient without increasing the entropy of the universe – unless 
the Demon itself increased its personal entropy in the process. Here, we examine the 
Maxwell Demon1 2 3 problem from a modern information theoretic and a computer 
science point-of-view, rather than from a physical point-of-view. Specifically, we 

Complexica Report 031128 

calculate the required capacity of a communication channel that transports information to 
and from the Demon. We imagine that our Demon is an idealized computer composed of 
a set of tapes that can be written and erased. The entropy increase of the universe is 
measured as the sum of the entropy decrease of the sorted particles plus the number of 
bits in a minimal computer program that sorts the particles. 
  
This paper complements a treatment4 of the Maxwell Demon problem that takes a purely 
physical point-of-view. There, the entropy increase of the universe is calculated from a 
traditional thermodynamic approach in which the Demon is represented by an ensemble 
of purely physical computational engines.  The ensemble approach and the computational 
approach yield the same results. The equivalence of the two approaches was first pointed 
out by Zurek who also pointed out that entropy can be partitioned, as we have done here, 
into a piece that is purely statistical and a piece that is purely computational.5 The 
statistical piece of the entropy is just the missing information in the problem and the 
computational piece is the minimal number of bits needed to describe the known 
information. The advantage of the approach taken here is that it can be easily generalized 
to nonphysical systems. It allows us, for example, to treat financial markets as 
thermodynamic systems.6 
 
The approach leads to very specific quantitative results. We show that the minimum 
entropy increase of the universe due to sorting particles from an initially random state is

2.  The Maxwell Demon 

Maxwell wished to address the question of the role of intelligence in the flow of entropy. 
The Demon was an intelligent agent that sat at a trapdoor separating a box into two sides. 
Particles inhabited both sides of the box. The Demon observed the particles and allowed 
fast particles to enter into one side of the box and slow particles to enter into the other 
side of the box. Particles that tried to escape from their proper sides were thwarted by a 
closed trapdoor. The entropy of the particles was thus decreased and a temperature 
gradient, capable of producing useful work, was created. The intelligent Demon seemed 
to violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Either the Second Law had to be 
abandoned or the entropy of the Demon had to increase to compensate for the decrease in 
entropy of the particles.  

Figure 1: The Maxwell Demon observes the particles and writes relevant information to an 
Input Tape (or Tapes) that is immersed in a Heat Bath. The Input Tape is also known as 
“Data” or “Measurements.” The Computer extracts relevant control information from the 
Input Tape and writes the information to an Output Tape, or “Controller,” or “Memory 
Unit,” that sends control signals to a barrier that allows particles to pass or not. The 
remaining nonessential information is written to a History Tape, or “Garbage Tape,” or

“Maintenance Tape.”  The communication channel to the computer is the Measurement 
Channel. The communication channel from the computer is the Control Channel.

 and half 

. The Demon’s goal is to sort the particles so that all 

 particles identical in every way except that half of the particles are labeled 

 
Our version of the problem is illustrated in Figure 1. We imagine that we have a box of  
N
are labeled 
B . There is a barrier that divides the box in half. As in the original problem 
there is a trapdoor that, when closed, allows particles to access only the right,  R , or left, 
, side of the box and, when open, allows the particles to access the entire box. The 
L
trapdoor can be opened or closed in zero time and it absorbs no energy in the process of 
opening or closing. When a particle passes through the trapdoor it mixes with the 
particles on its side of the box infinitely fast so that the probability of a particle of a 
particular type on a particular side approaching the trapdoor is simply proportional to the 
number of particles of that type on that side. We measure time by counting the number of 
particles that approach the trapdoor Time  t , therefore, is the time associated with the 
 
particle approaching the trapdoor. 
 
The Demon in this paper is an idealized computer immersed in a Heat Bath at 
A  particles are on 
temperature 
the left and all  B particles are on the right. To do this it observes the particles in the box 
and controls the trapdoor. There is a communication channel, the Measurement Channel, 
to the computer from the System of particles that transmits measurement information and 
one, the Control Channel, from the computer to the System that transmits control 
information. We assume that the channels are lossless. No information is lost and no 
energy is consumed in the transmission. We neglect any energy transfer or entropy 
increase in the measurement process. We do, however, consider the entropy increase of 
the computer and the Heat Bath as it writes to and erases information from the computer.  
 
The computer itself is composed of a number of tapes. The tapes have been given various 
names by various authors. We will use several of the names in this paper depending on 
the context of the discussion. The most important tape is labeled “Output Tape” or 
“Controller” or “Memory Unit.” At each time step, the Memory Unit contains 
information on whether the trapdoor should be open or closed at time 
Unit transmits this information to the System causing the trapdoor to take the appropriate 
action. The writing and erasing of the Memory Unit may be logically reversible or 
irreversible depending on the existence of information on the other tapes. As Landauer 
pointed out,8  irreversible writing and erasure of a memory unit transfers an amount of 
heat of approximately 
Boltzmann’s constant. If the erasure is reversible, then no heat is transferred to the Heat 
Bath and the Heat Bath does not increase in entropy. Since the Memory Unit returns to its 
original state after erasure, the entropy change of the Memory Unit is zero.  
 
If the measurement process is optimal, then the Memory Unit is the only tape needed to 
control the System.4  Measurement information flows directly from the System to the 
Memory Unit without passing through the intermediary of other tapes. Here, “optimal” 
means that exactly the same amount of information is flowing in the measurement 
transmission line as in the control line. This can occur for instance if the measurement 

 per bit to the Heat Bath surrounding the unit. Here

process asks the question, “Is the particle that is approaching the trapdoor on the wrong 
side of the box or on the correct side of the box?” The answer to this question is 
completely correlated with whether the Memory Unit sends an open or a closed control 
signal to the trapdoor. If particles are initially uniformly distributed throughout the box, 
then the measurement process initially collects one bit of information per measurement 
and the Memory Unit transmits one bit of information per measurement. 
 
If the measurement process, however, collects more information than is needed by the 
Memory Unit to control the trapdoor, then a mechanism is needed to condense the 
information. This can occur, for instance, if the measurement process asks the questions, 
“Is the particle that is approaching the trapdoor a particle of type 
 or a particle of type 
B ?” … AND … “Is the particle approaching from the right or from the left?”  Assuming 
an initially uniform distribution of particles, the measurement process initially collects 
two bits of information per measurement while the Memory Unit still transmits only one 
bit per measurement.  
 
Excess information is stripped from the signal to the Output Tape. The unnecessary 
excess information is stored on the History Tape or “Garbage Tape” or “Maintenance 
Information Tape” and the necessary information is stored on the Output Tape. No 
information is destroyed. The Maintenance Tape and the Output Tape together contain 
exactly the same information as the Input Tape. Bennett pointed out9 that, in a logically 
reversible situation such as this, the Output, and Maintenance Tapes can be erased 
reversibly after the sorting has been carried out leaving only the Input Tape. Erasure of 
these tapes therefore can be performed without any transfer of heat to the Bath and 
consequently no contribution to the change in entropy of the universe. Heat is transferred 
to the Heat Bath increasing the entropy of the universe only when the Input Tape is 
erased. This is a logically irreversible process because once the tape is erased, there is no 
information remaining on any tape to restore the Input. The information on the Input 
Tape has been irretrievably lost. The increase in entropy of the Heat Bath is simply the 
information that was stored on the Input Tape. Conversely, we can reversibly erase the 
Input Tape leaving the Output Tape and the History Tape. The entropy of the Heat Bath 
increases when we irreversibly erase the surviving two tapes. The entropy increase of the 
universe here will be the same as irreversibly erasing the Input Tape. Physical examples 
of this process have been colorfully described by Feynman.10

We can make the discussion in the previous section more concrete. Suppose we are 
measuring two pieces of information about the particle approaching the trapdoor, the type 
of particle (
).  We 
imagine we have two Input Tapes. We write the first piece of information to the first 
Input Tape and the second piece of information to the second tape. Now, we imagine that 
we have two more blank tapes labeled “Output Tape” and “History Tape.” The Output 
Tape can contain the information  C  or   O  depending on whether the trapdoor should be 
closed or open. The History Tape can contain the same information as the second Input

A  particle appears on the right, then write 

 
The set is interpreted as “If an 
L
Tape and 
the Output Tape and 
to the left side of the box and  B  particles to the right.  
 
This instruction set is reversible in that if we know, for instance, that the trapdoor signal 
is  C  and the particle is approaching from the left, then we know that the particle is of 
type 
. Therefore, if we know the contents of the Input Tape we can construct the 
Output and History Tapes. If we know the contents of the Output and History Tapes, we 
can reconstruct the Input Tape. Then, from Bennett’s arguments, we can reversibly erase 
either the tapes associated with the left side of Eq. (3.1) or with the right side of the 
equation. There need be no heat transfer to the Heat Bath in the process. Heat transfer 
occurs when we erase the surviving tape(s). The heat transfer is the same irrespective of 
whether the surviving tape is the Input Tape or are the Output and History Tapes. 
 
From Zurek’s arguments5 the total entropy increase of the universe due to the sorting is 
the sum of the physical decrease in entropy of the sorted particles plus the number of bits 
in the surviving tapes after all reversible erasures have taken place plus the negligible 
number of bits in the instruction set, Eq. (3.1). 
 
The argument still holds if we make measurements in a different, more efficient, way. 
Suppose that instead of measuring the type and side of the approaching particle, we just 
measure whether the approaching particle is on the wrong side or on the proper side. We 
only need one tape to do this. In that case, the Input Tape has exactly the same amount of 
information as the Output Tape. No information is written to the History Tape. The 
instruction set becomes 
 

W O

which can be interpreted as “If a particle is on the wrong side of the box (the Input Tape 
reads W ), write 
Input Tape reads 

 to the Output Tape. If the particle is on the proper side of the box (the 
), write  C  to the Output Tape.” Once again the computation is 

O
P

Complexica Report 031128 

reversible and either the Input or the Output Tape can be erased with no entropy increase 
to the universe. The entropy of the universe increases when the final surviving tape is 
erased. The amount of information on the tapes is smaller in this case than in the case in 
which two pieces of information are measured. Therefore, the increase of the entropy of 
the universe is smaller in this situation. If the amount of information in the Input Tape 
equals the amount in the Output Tape, then the design of the measurement process is in 
some sense optimal. This is the situation discussed in Ref. 4 if we reversibly erase the 
Input Tape after each measurement. 
 

4.  Entropy Increase of the Universe 

We now have the background we need to explicitly calculate the entropy increase of the 
universe due to the sorting process. We are interested in two initial conditions: 

•  Unsorted to Sorted - The particles are randomly scattered throughout the box. 
Thus we are going from an unsorted state to a final state in which  A  particles 
are on the left and  B  particles are on the right – a sorted state. 

•  Anti-Sorted to Sorted - The particles start out in the opposite state to the final 
state,  A  particles on the right and  B  particles on the left. Here we are going 
from a sorted state to another, but different, sorted state – a resorted state. 

In each of the cases we assume that the measurements collect information on what type 
of particle is approaching the trapdoor as well as from which side the particle is 
approaching. 
 

a.  From Unsorted to Sorted 

i. 

Probabilities 

Initially the particles are spread uniformly throughout the box. Half the particles are type 
A  and half are type  B . Therefore, at any instant, we expect that there are N/4  A  
particles on the left side of he box, N/4  A  particles on the right side of the box, N/4  B  
particles on the left side and N/4  B  particles on the right side. The trapdoor is open, so 
the particles mix freely. The probability of reaching anywhere in the box and selecting an 
A  particle is ½ . The same is true for  B  particles. Now imagine that a particle is 
approaching the trapdoor. The Demon decides whether to keep the barrier open or to 
close it based on the information about the particle he has just collected. If the barrier 
remains open, then a particle passes from one side to the other. If the particle approaches 
from the left then the number of particles on the right is increased by one and the number 
on the left decreases by one and vice versa if the particle approaches from the right. If the 
barrier closes upon the approach of the particle, then the number on each side remains 
unchanged. Initially, at time 0, we expect an  A  particle to pass through the barrier a 
quarter of the time. Therefore, at time 1, the expected the expected number of 
on the left is

The probability of finding a particle on the wrong side decreases with time and the

The solutions, Eq. (4.2), for the probabilities allow us to calculate (Appendix A) the 
change in entropy as a result of sorting for the System, the Controller, the Input and the 
Maintenance. We neglect the small amount of information in the instruction sets, Eqs. 
(3.1) and (3.2).

5.  Concluding Remarks 

In this paper we examined the information flows and entropy generation in the Maxwell 
Demon problem. We have attempted to treat the Maxwell Demon problem as purely a 
problem in computation, making the connection to physics through general principles 
developed by Landauer, Bennett, and Zurek (Refs. 5, 8, and 9). This approach 
complements an earlier treatment of the problem that takes a purely physical point-of-
view.4  The separation of the computational and information aspects of the Maxwell 
Demon problem from physics will allow us to relate nonphysical systems to 
thermodynamics.6 
 
We found that, in a physics-free optimally-measured generalization of the problem, the 
entropy of the universe increased by 
 
 
 
in going from a uniform distribution of particles to sorted particles and 
 
 
 
in going from anti-sorted particles to sorted particles. Here, 
sorted and 
 

*η  are given by Eqs. (1.2) and (1.4).

The entropy accounting is nontrivial. The various components in the problem transmit 
information or change entropy in non-obvious ways. For instance, the information flow 
and entropy generation for the unsorted to sorted case is 
 
Change in entropy of the particles in the box (order creation) 
 
Total information transmitted in measurement channel 
 
Entropy change of the tapes after erasure 
 
Information written to Input Tape (Data, Measurement) 
Information written to Output Tape (Controller, Memory Unit) 
Information written to History Tape (Garbage, Maintenance) 
 
Entropy change of the heat bath (heat generation) 
 
Total information transmitted in control channel 
Total entropy change of the universe (particles + bath) 
 
 
In the case that the measurements are optimal, the Maintenance Information,  MI
 
Even in the case in which there is no net entropy change of the particles there is heat 
generation and the entropy of the universe increases. Specifically, the information flow 
and entropy generation for the anti-sorted to sorted case is 
 
Change in entropy of the particles in the box (order creation)

There are two sources of “waste” in the problem. The first source of waste is associated 
with the Maintenance Information. This is excess information that is collected in 
measurements that is not used to control the System. This excess information ends up as 
irreversible heat generation. The second source of waste is due to the fact that a particle 
may approach the trapdoor more than once. This requires multiple measurements on a 
*η . An amount of heat 
single particle. This waste is associated with the constants η and 
proportional to these constants is irreversibly generated. The total entropy increase of the 
universe is due to the sum of these two waste terms.

There is another source of heat in the problem. This is heat generation that compensates 
for the net ordering of the particles. The entropy associated with this heat is fully 
balanced by the entropy decrease of the sorted particles. 
 
One can calculate the efficiency of an engine driven by the Maxwell Demon sorting 
process. This is the topic of a future paper.

When the Controller takes action (i.e. the trapdoor opens or closes) the numbers of 
particles on each side are either unchanged or incremented/decremented by one. If a 
particle approaching the trapdoor is on the wrong side, an  A  particle on the right side or 
a  B particle on the left side, the trapdoor is opened and allowed to pass through 
increasing the number of particles on the “correct” side by one and decreasing the 
number of particles on the “incorrect” side by one. If an approaching particle is on the 
correct side, the trapdoor remains closed and the numbers of particles on either side 
remain unchanged. Therefore, the expected number of particles passing from right to left, 
when a single particle approaches the trapdoor is

Entropy of the Input Tape 
The role of the Demon is to send the control signal to the Controller. To do this he needs 
to acquire information from the particles. As a particle approaches the trapdoor, the 
Demon initially collects two bits of information from the particle, its type and from 
which side of the barrier it is approaching. As the sorting proceeds, the amount of 
information collected by the Demon on each particle decreases. By the time the sorting is 
complete, the Demon knows which type of particle is approaching by knowing from 
which side the particle is approaching. Therefore after the sorting is complete, the Demon 
collects only one bit of information from each particle approaching the trapdoor. 
 
The Demon sends a compressed control signal to the trapdoor. Initially, the Demon sends 
a single bit per particle to the Controller, i.e. whether to open or close the barrier for the 
particle. After the sorting has occurred, the barrier is always closed and needs no control 
signal. 
 
The information collected by the Demon (or more accurately, the change in the Input 
Tape entropy required to store the information collected from the particles) is

Abstract 
 
This  note  adds  some  critical  remarks  on  the  discussion  presented  in  the 
McDonald's  paper  ([1])  on  stability  of  steady  motion  of  the  well  known 
problem of a disk rolling on a rough horizontal plane. 

 
 
In McDonald's paper ([1]) the general analysis of small oscillations about steady motion 
is based on equation (equation 54 in [1])

  reported  by  the  authors).  From  this  the  authors  conclude  that  »for 
0α   and  that  the  disk  will  appear  fall  over 
«. It seems that this is slightly incorrect for 
the  following  reason.  Namely,  the  rolling  will  be  stable,  if 
0α   this 
means  that  (2)  must  have  no  real  zeros  which  imply  that  its  discriminant  of  (2)  must 
satisfy the condition

The  value  of  the  alpha  constant,  known  to  be  equal  to  an  algebraic  expression  in  terms  of π  and  entire  numbers
related to certain group volumes, is derived from the relativitistic structure group of a geometric unified theory, its
subgroups and corresponding quotients.

1. Introduction.
It is known that the fine structure constant α is essentially equal to an algebraic expression in terms of π and entire
numbers that arises from the quotient of the volume of certain groups [1 ,2 ]. This expression may also be obtained,
using different physical arguments, starting from the structure group of a unified geometric theory [3 ]. Using the
geometric fact, in this theory, that the tangent space to space time is the image of a Minkowsian subspace of the
geometric algebra, the invariant measure in the symmetric space, defined by the associated  groups is transported to
space time.

2. A Geometric Measure.
The current *J is a 3-form on M valued in the Clifford algebra A. It is constructed starting from a vector field on the
symmetric space K. This space is G/G+ where G is the simple group whose action produces the automorphisms of A
and G+ is the even subgroup, relative to the orthonormal base of the algebra. The vector field is the image, under the
Clifford injection κ of a vector field in space time M. This injection allows us to define *J as the pullback form of a
3-form in K. The integration of the current in a three dimensional boundary of a region R in M is equivalent to the
integration of this 3-form pulled back from a geometric form in a three dimensional boundary of the image of the
region in the symmetric space G/G+. The latter form is defined by the existence of a geometric invariant measure in
G/G+. The constant coefficient of this invariant measure may be calculated in the particular case where the fiber
bundle  is  flat  and  the  field  equation  reduces  to  the  linear  equation  equivalent  to  electromagnetism.  This  relation
defines a geometric interpretation for the coupling constant of the geometric unified theory: “The coupling constant
is the constant coefficient of *J introduced by the invariant measure in the symmetric space G/G+”.

2.1. Symmetric Space K.
As indicated before, the group G is SL(4,R) and the even subgroup G+ is SL1(2,C). The symmetric space K is a non
compact  real  form  of  the  complex  symmetric  space  corresponding  to  the  complex  extension  of  the  non  compact
SU(2,2) and its quotients. The corresponding series of symmetric spaces coincides with the series characterized by the
group SO(4,2) as shown in appendix B. In particular we can identify the quotients with the same character, +4, in
order to write the series of spaces in the following form,

These quotients include the non compact Riemannian Hermitian R and the non compact pseudo-Riemannian non
Hermitian K symmetric spaces. Since some of  these groups and quotients are non compact we shall use the normal-
ized  invariant  measure µ
N  calculated  from  a  known  measure,  as  usually  done  when  working  with  non  compact
groups. For compact groups the integral of the invariant measure over the group parameter space gives the group
volume.  In  general,  the  normalized  measure    gives  only  the  functional  structure  of  the  volume  element,  in  other
words, the invariant measure up to a multiplicative constant.
The center of  G, which is not discrete, contains a generating element κ
2J the restriction of ad(κ
proper subspace corresponding to the eigenvalue -1 of the operator J2, or,

5) to the tangent space TKk. This space, that has for base the 8 matrices κα, 

5  whose square is -1. We shall designate by

The  endomorphism  J  defines  an  almost  complex  structure  over  K.  In  addition,  using  the  Killing  metric,  in  the

Clifford representation, the complex structure preserves the pseudo Riemannian (Minkowskian) metric. Furthermore

2.2. Realization of K as a unit polydisc D4(K).
The bilinear complex metric in K is invariant under SO(4,C) and does not have a definite signature. Using Weyl’s

unitary trick on the Minkowskian coordinates x
, y
 of the symmetric space K, its complex structure is related to the
complex structure of R. The generators of the quotient K are 2 compact and 6 non compact instead of the 8 non
compact generators of the quotient R. Both quotients have the matricial structure,

The conditions imposed by the associated groups SL(4,R) and SO(4,2) over the corresponding coordinates on these
spaces, expressed by the scalar product in this submatrix, are related respectively by the Minkowskian and Euclidian
metrics.

In this manner, the complex coordinates define a holomorphic diffeomorphism h of K onto the interior of a bounded
symmetric  domain D.  The  bounded  realization  of  the  space K  is  the  unit  polydisc  D4(K).  This  realization  D4(K)
corresponds to the bounded realization of the space R, the unit polydisc D4(R) by a change in coordinates. Although
the interior of D4 is not compact we can apply the existing  mathematical techniques of the classical bounded domains
to study the space K, in particular we can find normalized invariant measures for the spaces K and R.

2.3. Invariant Measure on the Polydisc.
A geometric measure on the space K, an 8 dimensional hyperboloid H8, arises from a measure on C5 in a manner
similar as the measure on the Euclidian spheres is obtained from a measure on Rn. In order to evaluate this measure,
it is convenient to use the immersion, i:D4→D5 defined on the intersection of the D5 and the plane z5=0. Since D5 is
a homogeneous space under the action of the compact group SO(5)×SO(2), using this group and SO(5,2) we may
obtain the measure on the quotient R, [4], which is equal the measure on K.
In order to construct these measures it is convenient to define certain domains related to D5, [5]. Silov’s boundary, the
generalization of the circle as the boundary of the 1 dimensional complex disk, is established by the Fourier transfor-
mation on the symmetric space Dn. It is the characteristic space of Dn, in other words it allows us to characterize the
holomorphic functions on Dn by their value on this boundary. It is defined by

3. Value of the Geometric Coefficient.
We may associate a physical current 3-form *J to the standard unnormalized volume form µ. Similarly, in a natural
form, we may associate another geometric current 3-form *Jg to the normalized geometric form µ
Ng with the same
factor or constant coefficient α
g. In addition, since the physical current form should not be associated to a normalized
volume form, this geometric current 3-form should be defined by additionally multiplying by the volume of a charac-
teristic space determined by the physical solutions. Let us define *Jg on the boundary of a region R in M,

The constant coefficient in this equation may be identified, once and for all, using any solution. If we assume staticity
conditions and spherical symmetry that allow a decomposition of space time M4 in two orthogonal subspaces, spatial
spheres S2 and the supplementary space time M2, the forms decompose in two components and it becomes easier to
calculate the constant coefficient,

The geometric charge Qg, given by the induced geometric measure, is the geometric calculation of interest. It repre-
sents physically the integral of the geometric current αj, obtained by absorbing the constant α in the current, over a
spatial hypersurface σGM that contains the S2 subspace. Let us restrict the problem to the special particular case of
pure electromagnetism in a flat space time M.

All solutions of this restricted problem may be found as a sum of fundamental solutions that correspond to the Green’s
function  for  the  electromagnetic  field.  The  Green’s  function  determines  the  field  of  a  point  source  which  always
corresponds to a spherically symmetric static field relative to an observer at rest with the source. Thus the restricted
problem reduces to Coulomb’s problem in flat three dimensional space. This is precisely the situation where the α
constant, or equivalently Coulomb’s constant, is introduced. The spherically symmetric harmonic potential solutions
are determined, using Poisson’s integral formula, by its value on a boundary sphere. We see that the characteristic
boundary space, where integration is performed to find solutions of the restricted physical problem, is the sphere S2 in
R3. Geometrically, in accordance with our theory, the form h*µ
Ng should be restricted to its component over the image
of a sphere, determined by the Clifford mapping κ, in the space K. Therefore, the characteristic space is κ(S2). We
have then the volume of this characteristic space,

The volume of κ(S2), indicated in the previous equation, is twice the volume of S2 due to the 2-1 homomorphism

4. Conclusions.
The  coupling  constant  of  the  geometric  unified  theory  may  be  calculated  from  the  volumes  of  certain  symmetric
spaces related to the structure group of the theory and its subgroups. There is no additional arbitrary constant to be
used in the theory.

Appendix A.
In what follows, we indicate Wyler’s calculation of the value of the constant coefficient of the measure on Q4, Silov’s
boundary  of  D4.  This  measure  is  obtained  by  constructing  Poisson’s  measure  invariant  under  general  coordinate
transformations in D5 by the group of analytic mappings of D5 onto itself which is SO(5,2).
The calculation is based on the following proposition: The isotropy subgroup at the origin, SO(5)×SO(2), acts tran-
sitively  over  Q5  and  Poisson’s  kernel  Pn(z,ξ),  harmonic  on  Dn,  represents  an  invariant  measure  of  the  action  of
SO(5)×SO(2) over Q5.
Although P4(x,ξ) represents a measure µ on Q4, it is not adequate in this case because we need the measure defined by
the Euclidian measure in one dimension higher, C5, the one induced from Q5. Since P5(z,ξ) is an invariant Euclidian
measure over Q5 we construct the induced measure by the immersion i:Q4→Q5 which is equal to the kernel P4(z,ξ) up
to constant coefficient factor. Functionally both measures are equivalent.

Appendix B
Here we indicate the relationship between the spaces R and K, as components of a series of symmetric spaces charac-
terized by the group SO(4,2).

The Cartan Killing metric for a group quotient space, G’/H, is taken as the metric in the subspace of the algebra of
G’,  complementary  to  the  algebra  of H.  The  exponentiation  of  this  subspace  is  a  globally  symmetric  space  [4 ]
because any point and its neighborhood can be translated to any other point by a group operation. In this way it is
possible to show that the metric is invariant.

Since both the group G’ and the subgroup H are related to compact groups by means of involutive automorphisms,
there  are  different  quotients  related  among  each  other  by  two  involutions  that  we  shall  indicate  as σ  and τ.  The
possibilities  for  both  involutions  are  exactly  the  same  available  for  the  involutive  automorphisms  of  the  complex
extension of the algebra. Hence, the classification of the symmetric spaces is determined applying a pair of these
involutions, taken from the indicated set, that commute and exhaust the possibilities. The simultaneous eigenvalues
of this pair serve to describe the Lie algebra A,

The symmetric space G/G+ has a negative definite metric derived from the Cartan Killing metric. The dual space
G*/G+, where G+ is the maximal compact subgroup, has an equal but positive definite metric, derived from the
Cartan Killing metric restricted to the complementary subspace of A*. Both spaces are, therefore, Riemannian spaces.

There is a theorem that says that the non compact irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces are exactly the manifolds
G/H where G is a connected non compact simple group with center {I} and H is a maximal compact subgroup of G
with a non discrete center [6 ]. There is a standard notation for the classification of Riemannian spaces, indicating the
Cartan subspace (A,B…), the involution type (I,II,III) and the dimensions that characterize the groups (2n,p,q).
There are other real forms of the complex group GC between the two extremes G y G* and therefore there is a series
of symmetric spaces that are real forms of the complex extension of  the quotient,

that fall between the two extreme Riemannian spaces. These intermediate spaces have an indefinite metric and are
considered pseudo Riemannian spaces. The different real forms within the series corresponding to a complex sym-
metric space are classified by their characters. The character of a real form is defined as the trace of the canonical
form of the metric. This integer, corresponds to the difference in the number of compact and non compact generators.
The series may be characterized by its non compact end group.
The series of quotient spaces related to the A3 Cartan space are of interest. In particular we choose the involutive
automorphism τ of type AIII(p=2,q=2) that determines a seven dimensional compact subgroup G+. We obtain, in this
manner, a series of eight dimensional spaces, characterized by the non compact group SU(2,2), corresponding to the
Riemannian space G/G+ and its dual G*/G+,

Due to the isomorphism of the spaces A3 and D3 we have the isomorphic series, characterized by the non compact

Abstract 

 

The principle of multiple solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations discussed in this paper 

is not directed at any particular problems in fluid dynamics, nor at any specific applications.  The 

non-uniqueness principle states that the Reynolds number, above its critical value, is insufficient 

to uniquely determine a flow field for a given geometry, or for similar geometries.  It is a generic 

principle  for  all  fluid  flow  and  its  transportation  properties,  but  is  not  well  understood.    It 

compliments the current popular bifurcation theories by the fact that multiple solutions can exist 

on each stable bifurcation branch. 

Introduction 

  Stokes (1851) was the first to recognize that a single dimensionless parameter, Re, uniquely 

determines a flow field for a given geometry.  Later work by Reynolds (1883) on the onset of 

turbulence in the flow through tubes led to this being termed the Reynolds number.  Since then, 

the concept of dynamic similarity has been firmly established and has governed the development 

of fluid dynamics for more than a century.  For example, a laminar fully-developed tube flow is a 

function of Re only, and is independent of the upstream (or entry) condition.  Similarly, for an 

equilibrium  turbulent  tube  flow  or  turbulent  boundary  layer,  the  Reynolds  number  uniquely 

determines their mean flows and statistical properties.  The upstream flow conditions can only 

affect the flow transient, which will be quickly forgotten as they reach their equilibrium states.  

This  is  the  concept  of  uniqueness  in  fluid  dynamics  that  we  have  been  taught,  and  is  the  rule, 

which guides the progress in fluid dynamics.  A comprehensive review of more recent work in 

multiple solutions can be found in Gelfgat & Bar-Yoseph (2004). 

 

In this paper, we state a different fact, contrary to the conventional wisdom, that the Reynolds 

 

75 

 

number  above  its  critical  value  is  insufficient  to  determine  a  flow  field  uniquely.    The  non-

uniqueness of fluid flow means that flows of different wavenumbers or frequencies can exist on 

each stable bifurcation branch.   The upstream  or ambient conditions can persist and determine 

the final equilibrium wavenumber or frequency whose accessible band is slightly narrower than 

the  linear  instability  boundary.    Consequently,  the  non-uniqueness  principle  differs  from  the 

recent popular bifurcation theories.  Some experiments have revealed this fact, but we constantly 

treat them as isolated incidents due to our firm belief in the principle of the dynamic similarity.  

This may be due to the lack of a theory to put those experimental evidences together to show that 

the Reynolds number plus the environments determine a flow field uniquely.  

  Since  Coles  (1965)  studied  that  Taylor-Couette  flows  have  multiple  solutions  for  a  fixed 

Reynolds  number,  extensive  studies  have  shown  complex  flow  structures  for  Taylor-Couette 

flows for various geometric configurations.  Similar phenomena have been identified for Benard 

instabilities  induced  by  temperature  gradient  or  surface  tension.    These  are  both  closed  flow 

systems.    The  observations  consistently  indicate  that  the  initial  condition  determines  the  final 

supercritical equilibrium state for a given Reynolds number.  In general, we have considered that 

the  multiple  solutions  for  these  two  types  of  closed  flows  are  special  cases.    The  concept  of 

dynamic similarity is intact for all other flows.  We will review this group of experiments first.  

The review is limited to the concept of non-uniqueness without touching any detailed physics of 

the flow, since the Taylor-Couette flow is probably the most studied flow in the history of fluid 

dynamics. 

  Even  though  the  idea  of  coherent  structure  for  large-scale  turbulence  has  been  around  for  a 

long  time  (Dryden  1948,  Townsend  1956),  flow  visualization  of  turbulent  mixing  layers  by 

Brown and Roshko (1974) was the first convincing demonstration of its existence.  Their picture 

of  the  turbulent  mixing  layer  was  the  key  to  the  gate  of  current  research  in  turbulence.    They 

collected  data  on  spreading  rates  for  plane  mixing  layers  and  found  a  large  scatter  about  one 

hundred  percent  in  the  measured  values.    Subsequent  research  has  found  that  the  evolution  of 

mixing  layers  depends  on  the  nature  of  the  environmental  noise,  which  is  facility  and  location 

dependent.  In our terminology, multiple solutions exist and depend on the upstream conditions.  

 

76 

 

Surprisingly, no communication has ever existed between the group who study turbulent mixing 

layers  and  those  for  Taylor-Couette  flows,  even  though  the  members  of  the  Cal  Tech  Group 

originated  both  experiments.    Now,  it  is  clear  that  initial  conditions  determine  the  equilibrium 

state for a closed flow system, and upstream conditions determine that for an open flow system.  

One  is  a  temporal  problem  and  the  other,  a  spatial  problem.    Only  one  fundamental  principle, 

nonlinear wave interaction, governs the evolution of both systems.  We will review the aspect of 

non-uniqueness of turbulent mixing layers and other relevant flows. 

  The  physics  associated  with  the  non-uniqueness  in  fluid  dynamics  can  be  described  by  the 

Navier-Stokes equations and will not change due to different methods of solution.  We introduce 

a  Fourier-eigenfunction  spectral  method  below  for  two  reasons.    First,  for  a  certain  class  of 

problems,  the  required  CPU  time  for  our  method  is  only  a  small  fraction  of  that  for  a  more 

powerful Fourier-Chebyshev spectral method.  Second, two equations  of historical importance, 

the Landau and Ginzburg-Landau equations, are the limiting cases of our formulation.  In 1945, 

Landau intuitively proposed the nonlinear form of the finite amplitude equation for the instability 

disturbance.  Stuart and Watson (1960) were the first to rationally derive the Landau equation.  

The equation has dominated the development of nonlinear instability of fluid dynamics for more 

than thirty years.  Almost all modern instability theories are built upon the basis of the Landau 

equation.    Many  important  progresses  leading  to  the  present  understanding  of  fluid  dynamics 

would be impossible without the Landau equation.  The simple fact that chaotic solutions of fluid 

dynamics  were  first  found  from  the  Ginzburg-Landau  equation  underscores  its  importance.    In 

the following, we will show that the nonlinear terms in both equations are self-interaction of the 

dominant wave.  Neither equation considers the possible nonlinear interaction among all waves.  

Some research has included more than one amplitude equation to study the nonlinear interaction 

between a few waves.  Unfortunately, the number of the interacting waves considered was too 

few and incomplete to reveal the importance of the non-uniqueness principle in fluid dynamics. 

  The nonlinear interactions among Taylor vortices with different wavenumbers was studied by 

Yao  &  Ghosh  Moulic  using  a  weakly  nonlinear  theory  (1995a)  and  nonlinear  theory  (1994b) 

formulated with a continuous spectrum.  They represented the disturbance by a Fourier integral 

 

77 

 

and derived an integrodifferential equation for the evolution of the amplitude density function of 

a  continuous  spectrum.    Their  formulation  allows  nonlinear  energy  transfer  among  all 

participating  waves  and  remedies  the  shortcomings  of  equations  of  the  Landau-Stuart  type.  

Numerical integrations of this integrodifferential equation indicate that the equilibrium  state of 

the  flow  depends  on  the  wavenumber  and  amplitude  of  the  initial  disturbance  as  observed 

experimentally  and  cannot  be  determined  uniquely  on  each  stable  bifurcation  branch.    The 

accessible wavenumbers of the nonlinear stable range lie within the linear unstable range minus 

the  range  of  the  side-band  instability.    This  agrees  with  Snyder's  observation  (1969).    These 

results also show that sideband instability is a consequence of nonlinear energy transfer among 

different  interacting  waves  as  well  as  with  the  mean  flow.    The  trend  of  energy  transfer  is 

determined by the stability characteristics of the mean flow. 

  The  analysis  of  mixed  convection  in  a  vertical  annulus  using  a  nonlinear  theory  with 

continuous  spectrum  (Yao  and  Ghosh  Moulic  1994a,  1995b)  yields  the  identical  conclusion  as 

that  from  the  study  of  Taylor-Couette  flows.    They  treated  the  spatial  problem  as  a  temporal 

problem.    This  is  possible  by  following  a  control  mass  system.    Plots  of  the  evolution  of  the 

kinetic-energy spectra for the two problems are identical in shape and differ only in amplitudes 

and ranges of wavenumbers.  A typical plot of the evolution of kinetic energy is shown in Figure 

1.    This  indicates  that  the  evolution  of  energy  spectra  provides  universal  and  fundamental 

information for flows.  The eigenfunctions, which are associated with the stability characteristics 

of the mean flow, are different for different flows.  The selection of the equilibrium wavenumber 

is  due  to  nonlinear  wave  interactions.    The  selection  principles  outlined  from  the  numerical 

results are quite universal and listed below: 

1) When the initial disturbance consists of a single dominant wave within the nonlinear stable 

region, the initial wave remains dominant in the final equilibrium state.  Consequently, for a 

slowly starting flow, the critical wave is likely to be dominant. 

2) When the initial condition consists of two waves with finite amplitudes in the nonlinear stable 

region, the final dominant wave is the one with the higher initial amplitude.  If the two waves 

have the same initial  finite  amplitude,  the  dominant wave seems to be the one closer to the 

 

78 

 

critical wave.  On the other hand, if the initial amplitudes are very small, the faster growing 

wave becomes dominant.     

3) When the initial disturbance has a uniform broadband spectrum, the final dominant wave is 

the fastest linearly growing wave, if the initial amplitude is small.  On the other hand, if the 

uniform noise level is not small, the critical wave is the dominant equilibrium one. 

4) Any initial disturbance outside the accessible frequency range will excite its Subharmonics or 

superharmonics  whichever  are  inside  the  accessible  frequency  range.    The  accessible 

frequency range is the linear stability range minus the range of the side-band instability. 

Experiments for Closed Flows 

  Taylor  (1923)  demonstrated  theoretically  and  experimentally  that  circular  Couette  flow 

becomes  unstable  when  the  speed  of  the  inner  cylinder  is  increased  beyond  a  certain  critical 

value.  His experiments showed that the instability leads to a new steady axisymmetric secondary 

flow in the form of regularly spaced vortices in the axial direction.  The documentation that Re is 

insufficient to uniquely determine a flow field in Taylor double cylinder experiment went back a 

half century ago.  Pai (1943) noted that the flow in his apparatus consists of either 4 or 6 Taylor 

vortices depending on the past history.  Using hot-wire anemometry Pai showed that the velocity 

field  differs  for  two  possible  cases.    Even  though  he  worked  at  very  large  Re  and  his  work  is 

primarily  qualitative,  it  is  the  first  experiment  to  show  that  Re  does  not  determine  turbulence 

uniquely.  Hagerty (1946) observed that the wavelength can increase or decrease by a factor of 

nearly  two  if  the  length  of  the  fluid  column  changes.    The  aspect  ratios  of  both  Pai’s  and 

Hagerty’s apparatus are very small that end effects dominates the results.  

  Coles  (1965)  observed  that  the  axisymmetric  Taylor-vortex  flow  becomes  unstable  as  the 

angular  speed  of  the  inner  cylinder  is  increased  further,  beyond  a  second  critical  value.    This 

instability results in a wavy-vortex flow, with azimuthally propagating waves superposed on the 

Taylor vortices.  Coles found that the spatial structure of the wavy-vortex flow, characterized by 

the  axial  and  azimuthal  wavenumbers,  is  not  a  unique  function  of  the  Reynolds  number  and 

boundary  conditions.    Different  equilibrium  states  could  be  achieved  at  the  same  Reynolds 

 

79 

 

number  by  approaching  the  final  Reynolds  number  with  different  acceleration  rates,  and  by 

rotating and then stopping the outer cylinder.  Coles recognized that time-dependent amplitude 

equations of Landau-Stuart type fail to predict and explain the non-uniqueness of Taylor-Couette 

flows and stated, "In view of the important advances in nonlinear technique which are contained 

in this analytical work by Stuart, Davey, Segel, and others, it is disappointing that such analyses 

do not serve the present need; but this is unfortunately the case." 

  The  non-uniqueness  of  the  equilibrium  state  observed  by  Coles  (1965)  was  subsequently 

observed in time-independent Taylor-vortex flow by Snyder (1969), Burkhalter & Koschmieder 

(1974)  and  Benjamin  (1978).    Snyder  (1969)  found  that,  while  the  wavelength  at  the  onset  of 

instability was unique, Taylor vortex flows with different wavenumbers could be obtained at the 

same value of the Reynolds number by varying the initial conditions.  He observed that there was 

a  band  of  accessible  wavenumbers,  smaller  than  the  band  that  can  grow  according  to  linear 

instability  theory.    The  region  between  the  linear  instability  boundary  and  the  band  of  the 

accessible  wavenumbers  is  now  known  as  sideband  instability.    Burkhalter  &  Koschmieder 

(1974)  found  that  the  range  of  axial  wavelengths  for  stable  Taylor-vortex  flow  is  quite  large.  

Benjamin (1978) observed different spatial states even in an annulus so short that only three or 

four vortices could be accommodated.    Fenstermacher, Swinney & Gollub (1979) studied the 

transition  to  turbulence  in  Taylor-Couette  flow  using  laser-Doppler  anemometry.    They  also 

found  that  the  different  spatial  states  had  different  spectra  and  transition  Reynolds  numbers.  

Presumably, these different final states at the same value of the Reynolds number are functions 

of the initial conditions. 

  Multiple solutions of complex structures have also been found for Benard instabilities (Chen 

and Whitehead 1968, Koschmieder 1993). 

Experiments for Open flows 

  Before we review turbulent flows, we would like to discuss an experiment of a laminar flow in 

curved channels.  Mees (1994) periodically modulated the flow rate by very low rms amplitudes 

of only a small fraction of one percent of the mean flow rate.   He tried a wide range of forcing 

 

80 

 

frequencies and found the accessible equilibrium frequencies are bounded in a finite range.  This 

agrees with the non-uniqueness principle of Coles' observation for Taylor-Couette flows and of 

the analytical solution for mixed convection.  Mees showed that any initial disturbance outside 

the  accessible  frequency  range  will  excite  its  subharmonics  or  superharmonics  whichever  are 

inside the accessible frequency range.  This is the fourth selection rule.  A plot of the averaged 

energy frequency spectra looks very much like Figure 1.  The flow visualization for curved-duct 

flows differs, of course, completely from those for Taylor-Couette flows or mixed convection in 

a  vertical  annulus.    This  is  because  their  flow  patterns  depend  on  their  particular  stability 

eigenfunctions.   

  Ho  and  Huang  (1982)  forced  a  two-dimensional  mixing  layer  by  modulating  the  inlet  flow 

rates of two upstream chambers at rms amplitudes ranging from 0.02 percent to 0.09 percent of 

the  mean  speed.    The  perturbation  is  homogeneous  across  the  span  of  the  mixing  layer.    The 

Reynolds  numbers  in  the  downstream  test  region  lie  in  the  range  100-1000.    The  response 

frequency  measured  near  the  trailing  edge  of  the  splitting  plate  shows  that  the  accessible 

frequencies are bounded in a finite range (see their Figure 2).  The forcing frequency, lower than 

the  accessible  range,  excites  its  superharmonics.    This  provides  the  initial  condition  for  the 

mixing layer. 

  One common argument concerning the turbulent mixing layer is that the large-scale structure 

is  instability,  may  be  a  transient  turbulence,  and  is  not  equilibrium  turbulence.    One  important 

contribution by Ho and Huang, which has not been widely appreciated, is their measurement of 

the  turbulent  boundary  layers  on  the  splitting  flat  plate.    Flow  transition  on  a  flat  plate  occurs 

usually fast as does its reaching the equilibrium state.  Their Figure 2 clearly indicates that the 

frequency of the energy-containing eddy of a turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate depends on 

the upstream conditions and can be any frequency within the accessible frequency band.  This is 

hard evidence leading to the conclusion that turbulent shear flows have multiple solutions. 

  The characteristics of the mixing layer differ from those of the boundary layer on the splitting 

plate.  The mixing layer is unstable to a long wave modulation.  Its accessible frequency range is 

lower than that for a boundary layer on a plate.  Consequently, the measured original frequency 

 

81 

 

immediately downstream of the splitting plate falls outside of the accessible frequency range of 

the  mixing  layer.    Therefore,  the  amplitude  of  the  original  response  spectrum  declines  and 

excites  its  Subharmonics,  which  increase  downstream  as  the  flow  approaches  its  equilibrium 

state.    A  plot  of  amplification  of  the  energy  content  (see  Figures  15,  16,  18  and  19  of  Ho  & 

Huang,  1982)  looks  very  similar  to  the  evolution  of  kinetic  energy  shown  in  Figure  1.    The 

shifting  of  accessible  frequency  ranges  causes  the  merging  of  several  vortices  simultaneously.  

They showed that the merging of vortices is the mechanism for increasing the spreading rate of 

the mixing layer. 

 

In terms of nonlinear theory, the merging of vortices is driven by sub-harmonic resonance.  An 

examination  of  their  data  clearly  shows  that  "pairing"  of  vortices  follows  exactly  the  same 

selection rules outlined above for nonlinear wave interactions.  Thus, "pairing" is determined by 

the stability characteristics of the mean flow and not by vortex dynamics.   

  Similar  experiments  intended  to  study  the  dynamic  process  of  turbulent  mixing  layers  have 

been conducted with a mechanical flap at the trailing edge (Oster & Wygnanski 1982; Weisbrot 

& Wygnanski 1988).  They found that the oscillations of the flap have no significant effect on 

the initial velocity distribution nor on the total turbulent energy near the trailing of the splitting 

plate.    Nevertheless,  the  forced  oscillations  caused  remarkable  differences  in  the  mixing  layer 

downstream.  Oster and Wygnanski found that, in the absent of forcing, the energy spectrum is at 

230 hz which is a subharmonic of the shedding frequency near the trailing edge of the flap (see 

their  Figure  2).    With  increasing  amplitude  of  the  surging,  the  energy  content  at  the  forcing 

frequency  (60  hz)  increases  markedly.    This  follows  exactly  the  second  selection  rule  outlined 

above.  The frequency spectra (their Figures 32 and 34) show that the modulation of the mean 

flow is of the same order as the amplitude of the dominant wave.  This agrees with the nonlinear 

analyses of Taylor-Couette flow or mixed convection. 

  Weisbrot  and  Wygnanski  noted  that  fluctuations,  locked  in  phase  with  the  disturbance 

frequency, are responsible for the initial growth of the mixing layer.  It has been demonstrated by 

the nonlinear theory that an equilibrium state can only be achieved if the disturbance waves are 

locked  in phase.  Their  data  show  that the wave associated with the forcing frequency persists 

 

82 

 

very  far  downstream  and  that  the  spectra  of  the  broadband  fluctuations  associated  with  small-

scale turbulence depend on the large-scale structure (see their Figures 9-14).  Similar phenomena 

have been observed in two-dimensional, small-deficit, turbulent wakes (Wygnanski, Champagne 

& Marasli 1986).  This shows that the memory of initial conditions can persist far downstream 

into  the  final  period  of  decay  after  the  large-scale  structure  has  disappeared.    This  effect  is 

commonly  referred  to  as  history  effect  of  turbulence.    The  accessible  range  of  equilibrium 

frequencies of the large-scale structure is determined by the nonlinear energy transfer and differs 

for different mean flows.  This turbulent history effect is selective.  Because each experimental 

facility  has  its  own  characteristic  free-stream  disturbances,  the  waves  generated  in  a  particular 

facility  may  be  unique  to  that  facility  only.    Furthermore,  the  characteristic  free-stream 

disturbance may change for different locations and for different seasons.  The history effect of 

turbulence found in laboratories is exactly the non-uniqueness in Coles' sense.  Since the ambient 

conditions for a real flow are not a controllable design factor, a non-unique solution introduces 

uncertainty to real flows. 

Nonlinear Theory 

Fourier-Eigenfunction Spectral Formulation 

  A  fully-developed  mean  flow  in  cylindrical  polar  coordinates  is  used  as  an  example  to 

illustrate  the  nonlinear  theory.    This  limitation  of  fully-developed  mean  flows  can  be  removed 

with a substantial increase in the required computational time.  The formulation is for a temporal 

flow development, but can be easily converted to a spatial flow development.   

  The velocity components, (u, v, w) and temperature, θ, are decomposed into mean values plus 

disturbances.  It is not necessary that the magnitude of the disturbances is smaller than that of the 

mean values.  They are

and the b's are constants of wave interactions.  The linear terms of the Navier-Stokes equations 

represent the mean-flow convection of the disturbances, the distortion of the disturbances by the 

mean-flow  stresses  and  the  body  forces,  and  diffusion.    In  the  generalized  coordinates  of 

eigenfunctions, they are reduced to a single term, which determines the growth or decay of the 

i
wave due to linear energy transfer.  For a fixed wavenumber, ωm

 is more negative for larger m.  

This  indicates  that  eigenfunctions  for  larger  m  have  more  dissipation  capacity,  or  it  can  be 

interpretated as a smaller eddy.  But, this eddy is not in a spherical shape and is elongated.  This 

introduces  anisotropy  into  the  flow  structure.    For  laminar  flows,  the  feedback  of  small-scale 

motions to large-scale structures is negligible.  For turbulent flows, the magnitude of small-scale 

motions  may  not  be  much  smaller  than  that  of  large-scale  structures.    Their  structures  are 

determined by the stability characteristics of the mean flow.  

  The eigenfunction expansion (2) has reduced the continuity, momentum, and energy equations 

to  the  system  of  integro-differential  equations  for  the  amplitude  density  functions  without  any 

approximations.  Thus, the solution of equations (3) represents an exact solution of the Navier-

Stokes  equations.    It  is  worth  pointing  out  that  one  of  the  major  difficulties  in  the  numerical 

 

84 

 

solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes system is the simultaneous enforcement of the no-

slip boundary conditions and the incompressibility constraint.  Since the vector of basis functions 

used  in  the  expansion  (2)  are  solutions  of  the  linearized  Navier-Stokes  equations,  they 

individually  satisfy  the  incompressibility  constraint  as  well  as  the  boundary  conditions.  

Therefore, the expansion (2) automatically satisfies the boundary conditions and the continuity 

equation.  Thus, the numerical solution of the system of equations (3) is much simpler than the 

numerical  solution  of  the  Navier-Stokes  equations.    It  may  also  be  noted  that  straightforward 

evaluation  of  the  convolution  product  representing  the  nonlinear  terms  in  equation  (3)  is 

inefficient if the number of terms in the truncated eigenfunction expansion used in the numerical 

solution is large.  However, pseudo-spectral evaluation of the convolution product can make the 

numerical solution of the equations (3) a viable efficient alternative to the numerical solution of 

the Navier-Stokes equations.  A preliminary study shows that the required CPU time can be as 

little  as  one  sixth  of  that  needed  to  solve  the  Navier-Stokes  equations  by  a  Fourier-Chebyshev 

collocation spectral method. 

Weakly Nonlinear Theory 

  In the following, we will show that classical weakly nonlinear instability theories are special 

limiting cases of (3).  The weakly nonlinear development of the disturbances may be studied by 

expanding  the  Fourier  amplitudes  in  a  perturbation  series.    The  maximum  amplification  rate 

predicted by linear instability theory is used as the expansion parameter ε.  The amplification rate 

predicted  by  linear  theory  for  the  m-th  eigenmode  of  the  wave  with  axial  wavenumber  k  and

is  the  second  Landau  constant.    Equation  (11)  is  the  Landau  equation  describing  the  temporal 

evolution of the amplitude of a discrete monochromatic wave.  For a monochromatic wave, no 

three  waves  can  satisfy  the  resonance  condition;  the  second  Landau  constant  is  contributed  by 

the  self-interaction  of  the  wave,  which  forms  resonance  quartets.    The  nonlinear  term  in  the 

Landau equation does not represent energy transfer with other waves.  The equation (5) for the 

evolution of the amplitude density function of a continuous spectrum can also be reduced to a set 

of  N  ordinary  differential  equations  describing  the  evolution  of  the  amplitude  of  N  discrete 

waves.    Then,  the  set  of  equations  includes  the  weakly  nonlinear  energy  transfer  among  all 

waves. 

Ginzburg-Landau Equation 

  It is worth noting that although equation (5) describes the temporal evolution of the amplitude 

 

87 

 

density  function  in  wave  space,  the  integral  formulation  does  include  spatial  variations  of  the 

disturbances  through  the  Fourier  integral  transform  (2),  and  is  not  restricted  to  periodic 

disturbances.    In  the  special  case  of  a  slowly  varying  wave  packet  with  an  azimuthal 

wavenumber  n0,  and  a  spectrum  confined  to  a  small  neighborhood  of  bandwidth  δ  around  the 
minimum critical wavenumber kc, equation (5) becomes

different waves. 

Indirect Nonlinear Wave interaction 

  Both the numerical results and experimental data indicate that energy is drawn out from the 

mean  flow  to  support  the  disturbance  wave  and  its  harmonics.    The  amplitude  of  mean-flow 

modulation is as large as that of the dominant wave.  If there is no energy transfer to waves other 

than  the  selected  disturbance  wave,  a  set  of  simpler  amplitude  equations  can  be  derived  to 

replace  equation  (5)  of  a  continuous  spectrum.    Rigorously,  the  expansion  should  include  the 

amplitude  density  functions  for  the  mean  flow,  the  dominant  disturbance  wave  and  its 

harmonics.  We assume that the harmonics are negligibly small to simplify the algebra in order 

to demonstrate the concept clearly.  Substitution of the amplitude density function,

where aij and bij are interacting constants.  A0 is the amplitude function for the deformation of 
the mean flow, and  A k 0
 is for the disturbance wave.  The terms inside of the first square bracket 

on the right-hand side of (18) and (19) are from a three-wave resonance.  The terms in the second 

square bracket are from a four-wave resonance.  The terms multiplied by a31 and a42 represent the 
nonlinear energy transfer between the mean flow and the disturbance wave, and are not included 

in  the  Landau  and  Ginzburg-Landau  equations.    The  terms  represent  the  indirect  wave 

interaction and have been overlooked by most weakly nonlinear theories.  Any waves, which do 

not satisfy the resonance condition, can still interact indirectly by interaction with the mean flow.  

This  fact  has  been  verified  by  the  numerical  solution  of  (3).    The  term  multiplied  by  a41 
represents  the  self-interaction  of  the  disturbance  wave  and  is  the  only  nonlinear  term  in  the 

Landau  and  Ginzburg-Landau  equations.    It  is  clear  that  only  linear  energy  transfer  with  the 

mean flow, the terms multiplied by the growth rate, a, is considered in the Landau and Ginzburg-

Landau  equations.    Equations  similar  to  (18)  and  (19)  have  been  derived  for  the  interaction  of 

two  disturbance  waves,  but  none  of  them  have  considered  an  additional  equation  for  the 

deformation of the mean flow.  They have ignored the fact that the mean flow acts like a medium 

to provide energy to sustain the disturbances and assumed that the deformation of the mean flow 

is of smaller order.  Without the terms of nonlinear energy transfer between the mean flow and 

the disturbance wave, the energy is not properly accounted for.   

  The Figure 6.23 of Mees (1994) shows the importance of the indirect mode, a direct nonlinear 

energy transfer between the mean flow and all waves.  The indirect mode is responsible for the 

rising  of  a  broadband  spectrum  near  the  inlet.  The  broadband  spectrum  decays  and  transfers 

energy  to  the  dominant  wave  and  its  harmonics  as  they  move  downstream.    The  resonance 

 

90 

 

conditions cannot always be met among waves.   This agrees with our numerical solution of (3).  

The indirect mode is also likely to be the mechanism for flow transition to turbulence when the 

nonlinear energy transfer balances with the linear dissipation. 

Numerical Examples 

  The  numerical  solution  of  equation  (5)  requires  the  evaluation  of  two  integrals.    The  first 

integral involves a quadratic nonlinearity, while the second involves a cubic nonlinearity.  The 

solution of equation (3), on the other hand, requires the evaluation of only one integral involving 

a quadratic nonlinearity.  For the same accuracy the weakly nonlinear theories require, at least, 

double  the  storage  and  CPU  time  than  a  direct  solution  of  the  nonlinear  formulation  (3).  

Moreover,  equation  (3)  is  equivalent  to  the  Navier-Stokes  equations.    Thus,  from  a 

computational point of view, it is preferable to solve equations (3) directly.  Furthermore, (3) can 

be effectively solved simultaneously by parallel machines.

to  linear  theory  is  16

≤ ≤k

.  The  results  indicate  that  the  equilibrium  state  depends  on  the 

initial  condition  and  is  not  unique.    The  range  of  equilibrium  wavenumbers  was  found  to  be 

narrower than the span of the neutral curve from linear theory.  Flows with wavenumbers outside 

this range, but within the unstable region of linear theory are found to be unstable and to decay, 

but to excite another wave inside the narrow band.  This result is in agreement with the Eckhaus 

and Benjamin-Feir sideband instability.  The results also show that linearly stable long and short 

waves can also excite a wave inside this narrow band through nonlinear wave interaction.  The 

results  suggest  that  the  selection  of  the  equilibrium  wavenumber  is  due  to  a  nonlinear  energy 

transfer process, which is sensitive to initial conditions. 

 

In  the  following  we  will  discuss  the  results  of  one  case  for  the  initial  disturbance  at  ki = 3.   
The solution of (3) agrees with the direct numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations by a 

Fourier-Chebyshev  spectral  method  up  to  the  fourth  decimal  place.    This  is  not  a  surprise 

because both solutions are exact for the problem.  The equilibrium results of (3) are included on 

 

91 

 

Table 1.  The equilibrium amplitude at k = 3 agrees with the results of (5) and slightly differs 

from  that  of  (11)  due  to  the  indirect  mode.   On  the  other  hand,  the  largest modification of the 

mean flow is due to the third eigenfunction, m = 3.  This shows the insufficiency of the classical 

theories (11) and (16) which only retain the first eigenmode, m = 1.  The classical theories for 

monochromatic  waves  can  only  be  considered  qualitatively  acceptable  even  very  close  to  the 

neutral stability curve.   

  New physics is indeed revealed by our computation.  Each superharmonic represents a smaller 

vortex  of  less  strength.    The  Taylor  vortex  is  composed  of  a  sequence  of  vortices  whose  axial 

wavelengths  are  integer  fractions  of  the  dominant  one.    Also,  a  Taylor  vortex  is  not  a  pure 

stationary  wave,  but  with  a  small  contribution  from  standing  waves  due  to  the  eigenmodes  as 

highlighted  on  Table  2.    The  standing  wave  causes  a  small  oscillation  of  the  amplitude  of  the 

Taylor vortices.  In experiments, the dominant Taylor vortex has been observed to fluctuate with 

respect to time.  It is difficult to visualize the fine structures in a laboratory.  This shows that our 

computation  can  provide  more  detailed  flow  structures  than  experimental  measurements.  This 

demonstrates that the advantage of the new formulation (3) is not only that it requires much less 

CPU time than other numerical methods; it can also reveal more detailed flow structures.  

  The equilibrium states of mixed convection in a vertical annulus for η = 0.375, Re = 100, Ra = 

200 and Pr = 0.6 are not unique either.  The linear stability analysis indicates that the basic flow 

is  unstable  to  disturbances  within  a  narrow  wavenumber  band  between  0.23  and  1.13.    The 

selection of the final equilibrium wave for mixed convection follows the same principles as those 

for Taylor-Couette vortices.  The evolution of unstable waves for the initial disturbance ki = 0.25 
is plotted in Figure 1.  The final dominant wave is k = 0.5 due to the sideband instability.  It is 

worthwhile  to  note  that  the  mean-flow  distortion  is  much  larger  than  the  amplitude  of  the 

dominant  wave.    This  shows  that  the  assumption  of  the  classical  theories  for  monochromatic 

wave that the modification of the mean flow is a small-order effect is not valid. 

  Another  important  implication  that  the  equilibrium  state  of  the  mean  flow  and  the  wave 

components are not unique is that time-averaged turbulent mean flows are not unique for a given 

Reynolds number.  Thus, the values of time-averaged turbulent statistical quantities do not equal 

 

92 

 

the ensemble average for stationary turbulence.  From an application point of view, only the time 

average has physical significance. 

Conclusion 

  I  hope  I  have  convinced  you  that  non-uniqueness  is  a  generic  property  for  all  fluid  flow.  

Reynolds  number  alone  is  insufficient  to  uniquely  determine  a  flow  field  and  its  transport 

properties.    Low-amplitude  environmental  perturbations  can  have  profound  effects  on  the 

determination of the equilibrium state.  For problems near the onset of instability, the dynamic 

similarity  ensured  by  the  Reynolds  number  requires  only  a  minimum  modification.    The 

variation of engineering data, such as Nusselt numbers and flow resistance, can be substantial, 

but  they  involve  no  exciting  new  physics.    For  turbulence,  I  believe,  modification  will  not  be 

small.

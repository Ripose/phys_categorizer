Antiproton Stacking in the Recycler

Abstract 

 
Possibilities to accumulate antiprotons in the Recycler are considered for three different 
cases: with current stochastic cooling, with upgraded stochastic cooling and with electron 
cooling.  With  stochastic  cooling  only,  even  upgraded,  Recycler  looks  hardly  useful. 
However, with electron cooling at its goal parameters and reasonably good vacuum in the 
Recycler, this machine would be efficient.       
 

1.  Introduction 

Recycler is a storage ring of 3.3 km constructed to accumulate antiprotons at 8.9 GeV/c, 
see  Ref.  [1].  Originally,  a  significant  portion  of  them  (0.2-0.6)  were  supposed  to  be 
antiprotons returned from the Tevatron after their use and significant degradation. That is 
why the machine got its name. Recently, however, the recycling and 132 ns operation in 
Tevatron  have  been  dropped  from  the  project  scope  for  a  purpose  to  maximize  the 
performance  benefit,  while  minimizing  the  cost,  effort  and  technical  risk  [2].  This 
revision requests a new scenario for the pbars accumulation. Now, Recycler is supposed 
to be used for cooling and stacking of pbars coming only from the Accumulator, where 
the  maximal  stack  is  significantly  limited  by  IBS  and  instability.  Both  electron  and 
stochastic cooling are supposed to be effectively functioning in the Recycler, providing 
stacking of a high pbar flux from the Accumulator; this also requires a good lifetime and 
small diffusion. Presently, the electron cooling is a project with electron beam of required 
energy  being  under  research  and  development  away  from  the  Recycler,  while  both 
longitudinal and transverse stochastic cooling systems are installed and ready to function. 
That is why the first question of this paper is can the Recycler be useful for the proton 
accumulation  before  electron  cooling  being  available;  this  question  is  addressed  in  the 
next chapter. The second question is about possibilities with the electron cooling, and this 
is discussed in the chapter after that. 
 
  

2.  Stochastic cooling only 

 
Stochastic cooling in the Recycler consists of the longitudinal filter cooling (0.5-1 plus 1-
2  GHz)  and  the  transverse  cooling  (2-4  GHz)  systems.  A  question  is  how  many 
antiprotons  can  be  accumulated  in  the  Recycler  and  effectively  transferred  to  Main 
Injector  (MI),  assuming  certain  vacuum,  injection  /  extraction  imperfections,  IBS, 
limitations of the Antiproton Accumulator (AA) and MI. Below, this study is described 
starting from the longitudinal degree of freedom.  

 
 

 

2.1. Longitudinal Cooling 

A process of longitudinal stochastic cooling in a presence of IBS is described by the 
Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) on the distribution function F=F(x,t)   (see, e. g. Refs [3, 
4]):

Normilized 95% emittance [mm mrad]

Fig. 5. Relative loss rate as a function of beam emittance. 
 
From this figure, it follows that the lifetime for beam with 10 mm mrad of the normalized 
95% emittance is 1.4 times shorter than one of the pencil beam. Thus, with the vacuum 
which is a factor of 4 worse than that in the Accumulator, the scattering lifetime of that 
10 mm mrad beam would be 120 hours. With 20 hours of the stacking time, it leads to 
8%  of  the  scattering  losses.  The  total  transverse  losses  includes  also  inelastic  nuclear 
scattering, which are estimated as +1-2%; thus, the total transverse losses are about 10%, 
assuming there are no other sources for that.  
 
Counting losses as 5% at extraction plus 10% due to the gas plus 5% at the longitudinal 
tails  leads  to  20%  of  the  total  losses  and 
pbars  transferred  to  the  Main 
Injector.  
 
Possibilities to increase the bandwidth of the stochastic cooling system are very limited: 
the  mixing  factor  is  already  rather  moderate.  That  is  why  the  number  of  pbars  after 
coalescing, with this possible upgrade, is limited by 

at best.

3.1. General considerations

Contrary  to  stochastic  cooling  (SC),  electron  cooling  (EC)  benefits  from  phase  space 
reduction.  That  is  why  the  two  cooling  systems  are  conventionally  assumed  to  be 
complimentary:  after  SC  sufficiently  shrinks  the  beam  transversely,  EC  gets  to  be 
efficient.  Ultimate  temperature  of  EC  is  set  by  either  gas  scattering  or  by  pbar  density 
factors or by finite angles in the e-beam. From a side of pbars, the low temperature limit 
of EC can be set by either IBS, or a coherent instability, or the space charge tune shift – 
all  the  three  phenomena  getting  stronger  with  the  beam  cooling.  The  first  potential 
stopper, IBS, is going to be excluded in the same way as it was in the previous chapter, 
namely, keeping the beam at thermal equilibrium. Then, the coherent instabilities can be 
suppressed  by  broadband  feedbacks,  including  the  SC  itself  at  the  highest  frequency 
diapason.  Thus,  if  the  vacuum  is  good,  e-beam  is  aligned,  and  the  first  two  intensity 
stoppers are  excluded,  the beam can  be cooled down to the maximal space charge tune 
shift.  For  several  conventional  e-coolers,  the  beam  was  cooled  to  as  high  tune  shift  as 
=∆ν
(see e.g. Ref [6]). When angles of electron trajectories are comparable 
or higher than pbar ones, it reduces the cooling rates, and even may change their signs. 
This  feature  of  EC  can  be  used  to  prevent  the  beam  overcooling,  where  stability  or 
lifetime can be poor.      
 
To make an effective use of EC, a new batch, before being merged with the accumulated 
stack,  can  be  pre-cooled  transversely  by  the  gated  SC.  This  pre-cooling  would  be  too 
slow  if  the  longitudinal  phase  density  of  the  batch  is  too  high.  From  other  side,  if  the 
longitudinal phase area of the batch is blown up too much, a burden for the consequent 
longitudinal EC would be too heavy. Thus, there is an optimal longitudinal phase space 
area of the batch under the transverse stochastic pre-cooling. EC is not significant at this 
stage, and the e-beam can be switched off for the batch, which might be also beneficial 
for the electron current serving the main stack.  
 
After  that  pre-cooling  time  passed,  the  batch  transverse  distributions  have  to  be  shrunk 
enough; at this moment the pre-cooled batch is merged with the main stack, and the new 
batch  is  injected  from  the  Accumulator  in  its  place.  To  exclude  IBS  as  a  significant 
source  of  the  stack  emittance  growth,  the  stack  has  to  be  squeezed  in  the  longitudinal 
direction in accordance to its changing longitudinal and (possibly) transverse emittances. 
After  the  merger,  the  stack  has  the  same  repetition  time  to  be  e-cooled  down  to  the 
longitudinal phase space it had before the merger. Transverse gated SC is needed for the 
stack to compensate lack of EC for high-amplitude particles.    
 
 
 

 

3.2. Electron cooling rates 

 
Every  time  an  antiproton  passes  through  the  electron  beam,  it  gets  a  tiny  kick  against 
their relative velocity. These kicks, averaged over the betatron phases, yield the EC rates. 
Generally, the three EC rates (x, y, and z) of the cooled particle are functions of all its 
three  amplitudes;  they  are  expressed  in  terms  of  multi-dimensional  integrals  over  the 
electron  velocity  distribution,  the  cooler  length  and  the  particle  betatron  phases;  some 
useful  approximations  of  these  integrals  can  be  found  in  Ref.  [7].  For  simulations,  an 
analytical fit for the EC rates has been used, where the electron angles were modeled as a 
transverse temperature described by a certain rms angle in the cooling section. Formulas 
for this fit of EC rates are expressed in terms of elementary and special (Bessel) functions 
[8]; they can be found in the Appendix 2. The fit inaccuracy is believed to be not worse 
than 10-20%.  Plots illustrating some features of EC rates are presented in Figs. 6 and 7.

previous figure. The red line describes dependence of the horizontal rate on the horizontal 
action when the vertical action of 0.5 mm mrad and the longitudinal velocity equal to the 
vertical rms velocity. The blue line shows how the rate changes when the two transverse 
actions  are  exchanged  with  each  other.  The  brown  line  relates  to  the  same  transverse 
actions as the red one, while the longitudinal velocity is 2 times higher. 

 
 
3.3. Cooling Simulations 

 
Cooling-stacking process with transverse gated SC and 3D EC of the stack is modeled by 
Monte-Carlo  simulations.  The  SC  with  its  cooling  and  diffusion  terms  renormalized  by 
the  feedback  through  the  beam  is  taken  into  account  in  the  conventional  way,  as  it  is 
described in the Section 1.3. Electron cooling rates are functions of the three pbar actions, 
they take into account finite e-beam radius and transverse temperature. The model shows 
an  evolution  of  the  distribution  for  given  values  of  such  input  parameters,  as  initial 
emittances,  transverse  and  longitudinal  diffusion  coefficients,  injection  rate,  batch  and 
stack intensities and bunching factors, band of SC and the mentioned e-beam parameters. 
The  simulation  consists  of  two  parts:  the  transverse  stochastic  pre-cooling  of  the  batch 
during the repetition period, and then combined electron-stochastic cooling of this batch 
merged with the stack for the next repetition period. When the stack is merged with the 
batch, its longitudinal emittance gets to be high. The self-consistency requirement is for 
the  stack  emittances  being  cooled  for  the  repetition  period  to  the  values  they  had  just 
before  the  last  merger.  When  the  final  emittances  exceed  the  initial,  cooling  is 
insufficient;  if  they  are  below,  it  means  that  there  is  an  additional  safety  factor  in  the 
cooling. The bunching factor of the pre-cooled batch is not important, because the SC is 
not sensitive to that, provided the compression is not so high as to drive the bunch into 

the bad mixing area. Also, the number of particles in the batch is normally considered so 
small that IBS is not significant for that in any case. As for the stack, the bunching factor 
is  given  by  the  requirement  of  thermal  equilibrium  for  its  current  longitudinal  and 
transverse emittances; thus, it varies during the cooling process.  
 
Below,  several  scenarios  of  cooling  are  shown,  their  common  parameters  are  given  in 
Table 1.

Results of this particular simulation present several important features.  

•  There is infinite number of possibilities to reach the goals of Table 1. 

 

 

•  For the same electron current and vacuum, final stack emittance can be provided 

as any value between 3 and 10 mm mrad. 

•  Lower electron current can be compensated by better vacuum  
•  The stack bunching varies in cooling process. Electron current may be either DC 

or follow the same pattern.  

 

 

3.4. Coherent Instabilities 

 
The space charge tune shift  ν∆  for the maximal number of particles in the cooled stack 
is calculated as 0.08, which is not far from its conventional limit of 0.10-0.15. That high 
tune  shift  suppresses  Landau  damping;  thus,  the  beam  is  going  to  be  transversely 
unstable. To prevent this, a broadband feedback is required. The instability, driven by the 
resistive  wall,  is  expected  to  be  fastest  at  the  lowest  frequency,  corresponding  to  the 
fractional part of the betatron tunes, i. e. at about 50 KHz; the growth time is estimated as 
300  turns.  The  highest  limit  for  unstable  frequency  band  is  determined  by  the  Landau 
damping, being effective at frequencies

For  the  listed  set  of  parameters  this  boundary  is  as  high  as  0.7  GHz.  Because  of 
uncertainty  of  the  core  distribution  of  the  cooled  stack,  a  safety  with  this  issue  would 
require the feedback up to ~ 2 GHz, which is lower frequency of the transverse stochastic 
cooling system.

3.5. Conclusions 

 
A model is developed which allows simulation of antiproton stacking in the Recycler. It 
shows  that  electron  cooling  might  lead  to  high  accumulated  current,  provided  that  both 
the Recycler and the electron beam satisfy certain requirements. Several examples for a 
set of the satisfactory parameters are presented; details of the cooling process are shown 
and discussed.

Appendix 2. Electron cooling rates 
 
A  set  of  fitting  formulas  leading  to  the  EC  rates  [8]  is  presented  below.  The  rates  are 
functions  of  the  two  transverse  actions  and  momentum  offset  of  the  cooled  particle,  as 
well  as  electron  beam  radius  and  transverse  temperature.  Longitudinal  temperature  of 
electrons is supposed to be negligible.

The magnetic moment of the proton is calculated using a geometric unified theory. The geometry deter-
mines a generalized Pauli equation showing anomalous magnetic terms due to the triplet proton struc-
ture. The theoretical result gives a bare anomalous Landé gyromagnetic g-factor close to the experimen-
tal value. The necessary radiative corrections should be included in the actual theoretical dressed value.
The first order correction raises the value to 2(2.7796). Similarly we obtain for the neutron gyromagnetic
g-factor the value 2(1.9267).

1. Introduction.
The  proton  triple  structure  may  be  related  to  a  non-linear  geometric  theory  that  unifies  gravitation  and
electromagnetism that offers the possibility of representing other interactions by a sector of the connection [1 ,2,3 ].
It has been shown that new electromagnetic consequences of the theory lead to quanta of electric charge and magnetic
flux, providing a plausible explanation to the fractional quantum Hall effect [4,5 ]. On the other hand we also have
considered an approximation to this geometric non linear theory [6 ] where the microscopic physical objects (geometric
particles) are realized as linear geometric excitations, geometrically described in a jet bundle formalism shown to
lead  to  the  standard  quantum  field  theory  techniques.  These  geometric  excitations  are  essentially  perturbations
around a non-linear geometric background space solution, where the excitations may be considered to evolve with
time. In this framework, a geometric particle is acted upon by the background connection and is never really free
except in absolute empty background space (zero background curvature). The background space carries the universal
inertial properties which should be consistent with the ideas of Mach [7 ] and Einstein [8 ] that assign fundamental
importance of far-away matter in determining the inertial properties of local matter including the inertial mass. We
may interpret the geometric excitations as geometric particles and the background as the particle vacuum. This is a
generalization of what is normally done in quantum field theory when particles are interpreted as vacuum excitations.
The  vacuum  is  replaced  by  a  background  solution  that  we  call  the  substratum.  The  field  equation  of  the  theory
admits  a  constant  connection  and  current  substratum  solution  determining  a  geometric  symmetric  curved  space
[9,10 ].

The geometry is related to a connection Γ in a principal fiber bundle (E,M,G). The structure group G is SL(4,R)
and the even subgroup G+ is SL1(2,C). The subgroup L (Lorentz) is the subgroup of  G+ with real determinant, in
other words, SL(2,C). There is only another subgroup P in the possible group chains  G⊃H⊃L, which is Sp(4,R).
The  holonomy  groups  of  the  connection  may  be  used  geometrically  to  classify  the  interactions  contained  in  the
theory. The subgroup chain SL(4,R) ⊃ Sp(4,R) ⊃ SL(2,C) characterizes a chain of subinteractions with reducing
algebraic  sectors.  Electromagnetism  is  associated  to  an    SU(2)Q  subgroup.  Matter  is  represented  by  a  current  J
expresed in terms of a principal fiber bundle section e, which is related  by charts (coordinates) to matrices of the
group SL(4,R). This structure defines a frame of  SL(4,R) spinors over space-time. The connection is an sl(4,R) 1-
form that acts naturally on the frame e (sections).

There  are  certain  important  problems  in  the  theory  that  should  be  discussed,  as  follows:  1-  To  find  the  role
played by the extra generators or connection components in the theory as non classical interactions, possibly nuclear
interactions. In particular, since only one of the three SU(2)Q generators is observable as a long range electromagnetic
potential  4-vector  A,  the  significance  of  the  other  2  unobservable  short  range  connection  components  should  be
clarified; 2- To further discuss the equations of motion for a complete G-system which should display additional
effects in comparison with the simpler equations for a P-system.

Here we address these problems. When we write the equations of motion for a complete G-system, we find that
we are able to calculate the bare magnetic moment of the fundamental (hadron) particle associated to the strong
nuclear interactions, in a non relativistic approximation.

2. General equations of Motion.
The non linear equations for the connection have a solution that we have called substratum [9, 10] which may be

We now designate different vector potentials in the connection with the following notation: eA is the electromagnetic
potential corresponding to the even part of the SU(2)Q sector of the connection; oA is the complementary odd part of
the SU(2)Q sector; Γ is the SL(2,C) sector of the connection which determines an L covariant derivative; ϒ  is the
complementary part. Both  οΑ and ϒ  are complex elements with real part along κ0 and imaginary part along κ0κ5.

3. Non Relativistic Approximation
We now take the equations as linearized equations around the substratum solution with a connection fluctuation
representing self interactions. For a non relativistic approximation, the low velocities and corresponding boosts are
of order v/c. We may neglect the terms of order v/c, which are the boost ϒ  and the hermitian parts of ✔ and ✛ leaving
their antihermitian parts

which is Pauli’s equation [13 ] with extra terms depending on the even and odd vector potentials eA, oA.

4. Magnetic Moment Term
Equation (30) displays the remarkable geometrical structure of triplets. According to physical geometry [14] a
G-solution should include the three SU(2)Q generators. We may associate the effect of a combination of three SU(2)Q
connection components, one for each possible P in G, as three classically equivalent electromagnetic potentials A’s
[2, 3]. It has been shown [14], in this geometry, that all long range fields correspond to fields associated to the fiber
bundle obtained by contracting the structure group SL(4,R) to its even subgroup SL1(2,C) which in turn correspond
to  classical  fields.  Therefore  the  long  range  component  of  the  sl(4,R)-connection  coincides  with  the  long  range
component of an sl1(2,C)-connection corresponding to an even subalgebra sl(2,C)/u(1) of sl(4,R) [14] related to
gravitational and electromagnetic fields. In fact any direction in the tridimensional geometric electromagnetic su(2)Q
subalgebra may be identified as a valid direction corresponding to this remaining long range classical electromagnetic
u(1). There is no preferred direction in su(2)Q. If we observe a long range electromagnetic field, we may always
align the classical field A with any of the 3 geometric electromagnetic κ generators in su(2)Q, or a linear combination,
by performing SU(2)Q transformation. Nevertheless the two extra A’s should make additional contributions to the
magnetic energy of the short range G-system, as shown in equation (30), and therefore to its corresponding magnetic
moment.

The electromagnetic subgroup is SU(2)Q, similar to the spin subgroup SU(2)S. The group itself, as a fiber bundle
(SU(2),S2,U(1)) carries its own representations. The base space is the coset SU(2)/U(1) which is the bidimensional
sphere S2. The fiber is an arbitrary even subgroup U(1). The action of this electromagnetic SU(2)Q is a multiplication
on the fiber by an element of the U(1) subgroup and a translation on the base space S2 by the action of the SU(2)Q
group Casimir operator, representing a squared total SU(2)Q rotation.

This action is not as simple as translations in flat spaces, but rather has complications similar to those associated
with angular momentum due to the SU(2) group geometry. The orientation of directions in SU(2) is quantized. In
particular only one component of the electromagnetic rotation generator E commutes with the group Casimir operator
E2. This operator acts on the symmetric coset S2 becoming the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the coset. Its eigenvalues
are geometrically related to translations on S2  in the same manner as the eigenvalues of the usual Laplace operator
are related to translations on the plane. There are definite simultaneous eigenvalues, with the Casimir operator, only
along  any  arbitrary  single  su(2)  direction,  which  we  have  taken  as  the  direction  of  the  even  generator  eE.  The
generator E may be decomposed in terms of the complementary odd component  oE. We can not decompose the A
connection into components with definite expectation values. The splitting of A into an even part eA and an odd part
oA  represents,  respectively,  the  splitting  of  the  group  action  into  its  vertical  even  action  on  the  fiber  and  a
complementary odd translation on the base S2.

Consider  that  the  exponential  functions  ek.r  form  a  representation  of  the  translation  group  on  the  plane.  The

magnitude of the translation k is determined by the eigenvalue of the Laplace operator <,

The odd subspace of su(2)Q, spanned by the two compact odd electromagnetic generators in oE, is isomorphic to
the odd subspace of the quaternion algebra, spanned by its orthonormal set qa. Associated to this orthonormal set we
have the Dirac operator q$= on a curved bidimensional space. This Dirac operator is the representation of oE on the
vector functions on the sphere. We obtain for this action of oE, if we separate the wave function ϕ into the SU(2)S
eigenvector φ and the SU(2)Q eigenvector ψ, and use the fact that the Levi-Civita connection is symmetric,

This equation shows that the squared curved Dirac operator is the Laplace-Beltrami or Casimir operator, with
eigenvalues  equal  to  the  squared  translation  magnitude  on  the  odd  sphere  S2.  Therefore  the  odd  electromagnetic
generator  oE is related to translations on the electromagnetic S2. In general quaternion  oE squared is the Casimir
2  which  acts  on  the  coset  SU(2)/U(1).  The  oE  direction  in  the  odd  tangent  plane  is  indeterminable
quaternion  C
because there are no odd eigenvectors common with eE and E2 and therefore no definite values for the generators in
this plane. Nevertheless the absolute value of this quaternion must be the square root of the absolute value of the Casimir
quaternion, which also corresponds to the squared total rotation E2. In the orthonormal base of the common eigenvectors
of eE and E2, the absolute values of quaternions eE and E2 are the respective eigenvalues. The absolute values of eE
and #E define a polar angle θ  in the su(2) algebra. We conclude that the electromagnetic generator has an indefinite
azimuthal  direction  but  a  quantized  polar  direction  determined  by  the  possible  translation  values.  Therefore  we

The internal direction of the potential A must be along the possible directions of the electromagnetic generator E
in su(2)Q. The A components must be proportional to the possible even and odd translations. In consequence the
total A vector must lie in a cone defined by a quantized polar angle θ relative to an axis in the even direction and an
arbitrary azimuthal angle. The energy term in equation (30) becomes

Associated to the second ª3 term in the parenthesis we have introduced the effective direction angle θ of the total
generator, for a G-system, in the su(2) algebra. The value of θ is π/3. Statistically this direction corresponds to the
expected (mean) value of the projected component, of a random classical direction, along the chosen even direction.
The first term in the parenthesis is related to the P-system which has only a U(1) electromagnetic subgroup and
the complications due to SU(2) are not present. The complementary odd subspace corresponding to S2 does no exist.
The orientation of the complete electromagnetic connection A can always be taken along the definite even direction
defined by the physical u(1) algebra. The angle θ may be taken equal to zero. It corresponds to a P-system, associated
to the electron, with only a κ0 electromagnetic component. In this case the energy reduces to

If it were possible to make a transformation that aligns the internal direction θ along the even direction everywhere,
we really would be dealing with a P-system because we actually would have restricted the connection to a P subgroup.
A P-system provides a preferred direction in the subgroup SU(2)Q of G, the only electromagnetic generator κ0 of the
associated P group. If we use a P-test-particle (an electron) to interact with an external magnetic field B, we actually
align  the  long  range  component  A  with  this  preferred  direction.  In  this  manner  we  may  explain  the  long-range
physical experiments using an abelian electromagnetic field equation with a remote source and a Dirac equation. If
we use a G-test-particle (a proton) to interact with an external field, the most we can do is to align the classical long-
range component A with a random direction in su(2). Part of the total internal field iB is only observable in a short

range region. To each B direction related by an SU(2)Q transformation, there corresponds a “partner” spin direction,
defining associated scalar products σ.B. The additional scalar products, relative to a P-system, arise from the two
additional geometric fields, and/or, equivalently, from the two additional copies of Pauli matrices κnκ in the universal
Clifford algebra, determined by the additional spin-magnetic directions κ, which originally were along κ1κ2κ3 and
κ5. The additional spin operators, introduced by the short-range “non-classical” electromagnetic potentials, represent
extra internal current loops that generate an “anomalous” increase of the intrinsic magnetic energy.

We have calculated the magnetic energy of a free G-system, with zero external field B, in terms of the observable
even internal field eB whose internal direction coincides with the eventual internal direction of an external field B. In
this gedenken experiment, the magnetic moment is defined as the partial derivative of the magnetic energy, produced
by the total internal generalized magnetic field iB, with respect to the even component eB, in whose internal direction
would align the internal direction of the external B field,

The standard physical methods of magnetic moment measurement are nuclear paramagnetic resonance [15, 16 ],
molecular beams and optical spectroscopy [17 ]. In a real physical experiment, when the sample is placed in the

particle will respond to an external field, sensing a variation of the electromagnetic field linked to the test particle,
in the internal direction of the external magnetic B field which coincides with the internal direction of the even eB
field. The change in the magnetic energy, after restoring in the equation the fundamental physical constants e, ®, c
which are all equal to 1 in our geometric units, is

determining the proton anomalous gyromagnetic factor (2.732) and the nuclear magneton. For the electron we obtain

determining the electron anomalous gyromagnetic factor (-2) and the Bohr magneton. These identifications give the
bare magnetic moments, from the magnetic energy in the geometric generalized Dirac equation, for the only two
stable charged fundamental fermionic excitations in the geometric theory, the electron and the proton. They require
radiative corrections to obtain the experimental values.

In QED the calculated values of the zero order magnetic moment for the electron and the proton, given by their
external Coulomb field scattering diagrams, are singular. For both cases, the interaction hamiltonian for the external
Coulomb field differs by the additional anomalous coefficient g, determined by equation (40). The effect of this
difference is to adjoin the coefficient g to the external vertex in the diagram. Thus after renormalization the zero

order  magnetic  moment  values  for  the  proton  and  electron  are  proportional  by  the  factor  of  order  zero  g0.  The
radiative corrections for the electron have been calculated by Schwinger [18, 19, 20 ]. For both, electron and proton,
the first order corrections determined exclusively by the vertex part of the Coulomb scattering diagram are proportional
to the corresponding zero order terms. For the electron the vertex correction diagram, formed by an internal photon
line  between  the  two  internal  fermion  lines,  gives  Schwinger’s  correction  factor  α/2π.  For  the  proton  the  triple
electromagnetic  U(1)  structure  present  in  the  SU(2)  sector  of  the  geometric  interaction  operator J*Γ,  determines
three standard j.A coupling terms. The triple structure is also present in the noncompact sector of the algebra [21].
This indicates that a full proton excitation description requires three boost momenta ki. Consequently a full description
of the external Coulomb field scattering diagram requires a pair of internal fermion boost momentum triplets, instead
of  simply  the  pair  of  electron  momenta.  There  are  additional  U(1)  radiative  processes  between  the  six  internal
fermion boost lines corresponding to the two triplets. Therefore, there are multiple additional internal vertex diagrams
obtained by permutation of the internal photon line among the six necessary internal fermion lines, all contributing
to the first order correction. The multiplicity of the vertex corrections of the 6 fermion boost lines taken 2 at a time
is

There should be 15 vertex corrections, each equal to Schwinger’s value, α/2π, because of the SU(2) group equivalence.

which reduces to 0.5% the discrepancy with the experimental value, equal to 2.7928.

In a similar manner we may calculate the geometric magnetic moment of a combination of G, P and L excitations.
The total electromagnetic potential field of this excitation system is the sum of A, the SU(2)Q potential of the G-
excitation, and AU, the different U(1) potential of the P-excitation. Let ϕ be the common frame (½) eigenfunction of
the  potentials  A  and  AU.  Thus,  we  may  write  the  expression  for  the  total  magnetic  energy,  equation  (35),  in  the
following form,

The mass m corresponds to a G-excitation mass or proton mass mp. We assume the resultant charge distribution
preserves the dominant magnetic effect of the less massive E-excitation (electron). The corresponding expression

The radiative correction of this value should account for the presence of the additional P-excitation in the system.
This indicates that the excitation description requires four electronic boost momenta instead of the three momenta
required for the proton excitation. The multiplicity of the vertex corrections of the 8 fermion boost lines taken 2 at

This result has a 0.5% discrepancy with the experimental value of the neutron magnetic moment, equal to 1.9130.
We may consider the neutron as a (p,e,ν ) combination.

5.Conclusion.
The geometrical magnetic moment of the proton and the neutron, due to their spins and electromagnetic generators,
have a theoretical first order anomalous gyromagnetic Landé g-factor which is close to the experimental value with
a 0.5% discrepancy. There may be other corrections in the geometric theory, including necessary higher order terms,
which could eliminate the small discrepancy between the theoretical dressed value and experimental values.

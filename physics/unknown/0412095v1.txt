Abstract 
 
In  previous  papers  we  have  shown,  that  there  is  a  special  kind  of  non-linear  electrodynamics 
(which  we  name  Curvilinear  Wave  Electrodynamics  -  CWED),  whose  equations  are 
mathematically equivalent to the equations of photons and leptons of quantum electrodynamics. 
The purpose of the present paper is to show that in framework of CWED the description of the 
interaction is also mathematically equivalent to description of the interaction in quantum physics. 
Another  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  show,  that  CWED  allows  to  unify  the  description  of 
interactions in physics. 
 
Keywords: non-linear field theory, classical electrodynamics, quantum electrodynamics 
 
 
1.0. Introduction. A modern state of the interaction description. 
 
       In  previous  papers  [1,2]  we  have  shown,  that  there  is  a  non-linear  electrodynamics  -  the 
curvilinear waves electrodynamics (CWED), whose equations are mathematically equivalent to 
the equations of quantum electrodynamics.  
      The purpose of present paper is to show, that the mathematical description of interaction in 
CWED are also equivalent to that both in classical and quantum mechanics.  
      It  is  known  that  interaction  defines  the  most  important  characteristics  of  the  matter  motion 
and in form of the force or energy it is included in all equations of motion: equations of Newton, 
Schroedinger, Dirac, equations of weak and strong interactions, etc.  
 
1.1. Force and energy forms of the interaction description  
 
      As it is  known, interaction can  be expressed  as force  and as energy.  The force form  of the 
description  of  interaction  is  integral,  and  the  energy  form  relatively  to  it  is  differential.  These 
forms are interconnected and can be defined one through another. In classical physics, the force 
is equal to a gradient of potential energy. Generally this dependence is more complex, but is also 
defined  by  the  operation  of  differentiation.  This  implies  the  particularity  of  the  connection  of 
these two kinds of interaction description: the full unambiguity of transition from force to energy 
(and on the contrary) does not exist. For example, it is always possible to add to the energy some 
function (at least, a constant) so that the force value does not change.

     In  modern  physics  the  most  general  forms  of  the  interaction  description  are  introduced  by 
Lagrange and Hamilton approaches [3,4]. 
 
1.2. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian aproaches 
 
1.2.1. Mechanical system of a rigid body (particles) 
 
      Lagrangian mechanics works generaly in n-dimensional configuration space, which includes 
all parameters, defining a static state of mechanical system (coordinates of particles, orientation 
of rigid body, etc). A point  νx in this space draws a curve 
, where 
, called action, is 
n  is a number of independent variables). For such curves a functional 
introduced.  Only  those  curves,  on  which  the  action  reaches  an  extremum,  correspond  to  real 
evolution (Hamilton principle).  
      Usually consideration is restricted to functionals of the form

       In Hamiltonian mechanics approach the state of the system is described by a point (x,p) in 
2n-dimensional  phase  space,  where  p  is  momenta  of  particle.  The  dynamics  is  defined  by  a

1.2.2. Continuous systems (fields) 
 
      For fields the Lagrange function is defined by  density of  Lagrange function  L in following 
way:  
(1.7)    
, 
 
where  τd is an element of spatial volume. The Lagrange function density or Lagrangian depends 
generally on field functions and their derivatives, coordinates and time:

      In  the  present  time  the  Lagrangians  are  selected  on  base  of  some  general  requirements  of

      Hamilton  function  defines  the  full  energy  of  system.  When  it  is  known,  through  it,  by  the 
known method, it is possible to express all other characteristics of system. This aproach is most 
frequently used for the description of elementary particles and fields.

1.3.2. Non-conservative systems  
 
      Generally in nature the forces are not set as gradients of potential. In particular, this has no 
place in case of relativistic motion of bodies and in case of electrodynamics. But surprisingly, [3] 
here the generalized components of force can be set in such a way, that the form of the Euler - 
Lagrange equation is kept. Let’s show it [3].

1.4. The modern approach to the interaction description in the quantum field theory  
 
       Practically  in  the  modern  quantum  field  theory  [5]  there  are  no  enough  proved  arguments 
allowing theoretically to deduce real interaction. 
      The  rule  of  replacement  µP   with

known  for  a  long  time  and  is  successfully  applied  to  the  correct  description  of  experimental 
situations,  when  the  representation  of  an  electromagnetic  field  in  classical  potentials  is 
meaningful. The substantiation of this choice can be made, proceeding from the gauge invariance 
principle. (minimal coupling). 
       Note anything that is important in connection with our theory [5]: identification of the phase 
derivative  of  the  quantum  wave  function  ψ with  the  electromagnetic  potential,  expressed  by

( )xβ  is a phase, leads to  the existence  of  some observable  effects,  whose  sense  for the 
where 
understanding of interaction has been realized from Aharonov and Bohm [6]. In connection with 
CWED it is interesting [5], that it is possible a formulation of QED without the potentials, if we 
recognize  that  non-locality  is  inherent  to  the  concept  of  the  phase,  which  depends  on  the 
integration  way,  as  Mandelstam  has  shown  [7].  Then,  apparently,  it  is  more  reasonable  to 
consider  the  Bohm  -  Aharonov  experiment  as  the  instruction  on  essential  non-locality.  (Notice 
that  this  result  is  full  supposable  in  CWED  framework,  where  ψ -  function  belongs  to  an 
electromagnetic field). 
        In  quantum  field  theory  [5,8,9]  it  is  postulated,  that  as  well  as  in  case  of  motion  of  rigid 
bodies, the Lagrangian is possible to be presented as the sum of Lagrangian of free particles, and 
Lagrangian of their interactions: 

intL
Here  Lagrangian  of  free  particles  represents  the  sum  of  Lagrangians  for  each  free  particle 
separately. For example, in QED we have

is  Lagrangians  of  free  electron  and  photon  accordingly.  The  Lagrangian  of  the 
interaction is either postulated, or obtained due to gauge invariance in the form of current-current 
interaction. 
       As it is known in the theory of Standard Model (SM) the Lagrangians of free particles and 
their interactions are a generalization of Lagrangian of QED [8, 9]. 
       The target of the following part of the paper is to show that CWED allows us to obtain the 
mathematical  description  of  interaction,  which  is  adequate  to  the  modern  description  of 
interactions. 
      Since  in  framework  of  CWED  the  fields  of  particles  and  the  particles  themselves  are 
electromagnetic  and  only  electromagnetic,  further  we  will  consider  the  fields  and  particles  of 
CWED generally as electromagnetic fields and will name them “the CWED particles”. 
 
 
2.0. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian of the linear electromagnetic field  
 
     As  it  is  known  [4,10,11]  the  Lagrangian  and  Hamiltonian,  which    completely  defines  the 
system of interacting fields (photons) in the classical electrodynamics, looks like:

      Let's show, that this Lagrangian allows us also to describe the interactions as it has place in  
modern field theory. These results are convenient to unify in the following theorem: 
 

 

7 

       Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) of the system of interaction fields (particles), due to the principle 
of fields’ superposition, is automatically divided on two parts:  
1.Lagrangian  of  the  free  particles,  which  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  Lagrangians,  each  of  which 
describes  the  Lagrangian  of  one  free  particle  and  does  not  depend  on  the  presence  of  other 
particles. Lagrangian of one free particle is determined by squares of own fields of particle,  
2.Lagrangian of the interaction of particle, which is equal to the sum of Lagrangians, each of  
which describes interaction of one pair particles of system and does not depend on presence of 
other particles. Lagrangian of the interaction of any two particles is described by cross products 
of fields of these two particles. Let's try to prove this theorem. 
        Let  the  system  consists  of  two  parts  (particles)  1  and  2,  which  have  both  the  electric  and 
magnetic fields: 
. According to a principle of superposition a total field of 
system  of  particles  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  fields  created  by  each  particle  separately:

      As  we  see,  Lagrangian  of  systems  of  two  interacting  particles  is  actually  broken  into  two 
parts, one of which is defined only by own fields of particles, and the other is defined only by 
fields of pair of different particles. 
      In case that the particle is a photon, it is easy to see that terms of the first part correspond to 
Lagrangians  of  free  particles  [11].  In  case  the  particle  is  electron-like  particle  of  CWED,  the 
theorem is proved below in the section 4.0, devoted to  Lagrangian of boson-like and electron-
like particles. 
      Thus, we need to prove now that these terms define the interaction of the charge particles. 
 
2.1. The interaction description of two charge particles  
 
       Taking into account the known results [4,10,11,12] we will prove the above theorem for the 
case of two charged particles.  
       But  it  is  not  difficult  to  see  that  due  to  the  fact  that  the  general  Lagrangian  of  system  of 
particles is defined by a square of the sum of fields, in case of any number of charge particles the 
cross terms will be defined by fields that belong only to two different particles.

        Let us consider first a case when only an electrostatic field is present.

This means, that the Lagrangian, adequate to the third term, is Lagrangian of interaction of two 
charges and has the form of a current - current interaction for the case of a static field. 
 
2.1.2. The description of interaction in case of moving particles 
 
      Now we will consider the Lagrangian of two interacting charges, which are in motion. Here 
alongside with an  electric field the magnetic  field  will also appear.  Thus,  we should  analyze a 
general view of the Lagrangian in case of any motion of electric charges 
       First of all, a question arises, of whether the electric field varies in case that charges move. 
This question can be formulated in more general sense: will the Gauss theorem be fair in case the 
charges  move?  The  experiment  answers  positively  [13].  Hence,  the  above-stated  analysis, 
concerning an static electric field, will be fair as well as in case of moving charges. 
       Thus, further it is enough to analyze only the term of the general Lagrangian, which contains 
a magnetic field.

2.2.  Interaction description of systems of charge particles  
 
       In case that the system consists of a number of charged particles of both signs and different 
sizes, we receive the object, possessing various new electromagnetic properties.  
       As  it  is  known,  the  system  of  moving  charges  possesses  in  general  the  electromagnetic 
moments.  In  some  cases  the  total  charge  or  current  of  a  system  (which  in  this  case  are  also 
named zero moments of a system)  can be  equal  to zero (i.e. it is  a neutral system) while other 
moments are not equal to zero. This means, that these systems are capable of interacting due to 
other  moments.  But  the  interaction  energy  of  such  systems  is  much  lower  than  the  energy  of 
interaction of  the charged  systems, but is not  equal  to zero. For example,  the atoms, being the 
neutral  objects,  nevertheless  are  capable  of  interacting  among  themselves  by  various  forces, 
which frequently are named Van der Waals forces (these forces are weaker than Coulomb force 
and depend in inverse proportion on five or six power of distance). In QM these forces depend 
additionally on spin orientation and other quantum parameters. 
       We  have  shown  that  the  neutral  particle  in  framework  of  CWED  [2]  is  also  an 
electromagnetic field. Thus, in case of neutral particles the interaction must also described by the 
formula of a current - current interaction. 
        For  the  charge  system  description  potentials  are  usually  used.    As  it  is  known,  the  use  of 
potentials  facilitates  the  mathematical  analysis  of  problems  of  electrodynamics.  Since  in  the 
CWED  instead  of  potentials,  the  strength  of  electromagnetic  field  is  considered  as  wave 
function,  we  remember  that  in  electrodynamics  there  is  an  opportunity  to  write  the  interaction 
through field strengths.  
      As  it  is  known  [10,11],  the  electromagnetic  fields  of  a  moving  charge  can  be  described  as 
following:

Each  of  these  expressions  consists  of  two  components.  The  first  component  forms  quasi-
2−R  and does not contain the acceleration of a charge.

1−R . It is easy to show, that the energy flax of quasi-stationary fields decreases 
2−R . Hence, the quasi-stationary field remains all time connected with a particle and does not 

The second component describes a wave field  of  radiation:  it is proportional  to acceleration 
and decreases as 
as 
create energy flax on infinity. 
      Thus, on large distances from a particle in expressions (2.23)-(2.24)  only the  second terms 
(named  wave  field)  remains.  This  means  that  the  electromagnetic  perturbations  can  propagate 
from charge particle to the infinity. Due to these fields, i.e. electromagnetic waves, the particle 
systems interact with each other on a long distance. Obviously in linear  case this interaction is 
represented by the interference of electromagnetic waves. 
     The description of charged particles’ system by means of potentials is more often, although it 
doesn’t have any advantages. In particular, [10,11] for the scalar potential in large distances from 
the system of charges, we have the expansion:

       Thus, in case of the neutral particles the interaction Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) doesn’t equal 
to zero, but can be presented as series, some terms of which will be equal to zero. 
 
 
3.0. Consequences of the theorem 
 
3.1. About masses of the interaction particles Transforming Energy into Mass 
 
       We have shown above that the cross product of fields in Lagrangian accords to a current - 
current interaction form. From this, the next important consequences follow. 
       1. The energy of two or more interacting objects is bigger than the  energy of free objects, 
and the difference corresponds to the term of cross product of fields. 
       An important question arises: how the interaction energy of two objects is divided between 
them? Let’s consider one concrete case. For simplicity we will only talk about an electric field. 
The full density of energy of two interacting particles looks like:

    is  the  density  of  interaction  energy  of

2c

      2. The interaction energy is divided fifty-fifty between two interacting particles. 
       From  above  it  follows  that  the  interaction  energy  density  of  each  particle  is  equal  to  each 
other: 

=

u

π

and the full density of energy of each interacting particles is equal to:

  for the first particle, and

   for the second particle.

       Since  the  energy  is  defined  by  integral  from  energy  density 

ε

,  the  same 

conclusion refers also to the energy.  

       3. From above, in conformity with the known expression 

m

, it follows that the mass of 

m =
1int m
 

2int
 

each interacting particle increases in comparison with the mass of the free particle on half value 
of the term of the field cross product. 
     In  other  words,  the  mass  of  interaction  of  two  particles  divides  fifty-fifty  between  them  so 
that

3.2. The Newton force form of interaction description 
 
       Let’s show, that in framework of CWED the consequences of the above-stated theorem are 
the equations of classical mechanics [3].     
 
3.2.1. The second law of Newton  
 
    According to the second law of Newton we have

(3.4) 

 are all forces acted on the particle.  

!
∑=
iF
!
where  p!  is a momenta of the particle motion,  
iF
       For particles in electromagnetic field, it is easy to show that the equation (3.4) follows from 
relativistic Lagrangian of the charge particle in the electromagnetic fields (see the textbooks on 
electrodynamics [4,11]). 
       If the question is only about the electromagnetic field without particles, in this case, as it is 
known [11,14], “The momentum theorem” exists, which shows the validity of the law of Newton 
concerning  the  electromagnetic  field  as  a  material  carrier  (note  that  in  framework  of  CWED 
“The momentum theorem” can easy to prove [15] by other way). 
      We  should  also  remind  that  according  to  Ehrenfest  theorem  [16]  it  is  possible  from  Dirac 
equation to obtain the equation of Newton (3.4). As the Dirac equation coincides precisely with 
the electron-like equation of CWED [1], it is possible to assert that Ehrenfest theorem proves that 
the equation of Newton also follows from CWED [15].

3.2.2. The third law of Newton. 
      Recall the Newton's Third Law of motion: “For every action there is an equal and opposite 
reaction”. It is easy to make sure, that the third law of Newton also follows from the above-stated 
conclusions. Actually, using the expression (1.20), we can write down:

Using  the  Euler-Lagrange  approach  (see  (1.21))  it  is  easy  to  show  from  (3.5)  that  action  and 
counteraction forces are equal. In addition, depending on which particle we will choose as initial, 
the direction of force will be opposite in relation to the other choice. Thus we obtain Newton's 
Third Law of motion: 
 
 
4.0. Lagrangian of interaction of CWED particles  
 
        Here we will consider the electrodynamics form of the Lagrangians of the CWED vector 
boson and the CWED lepton equations.  
 
4.1. Lagrangian of the vector boson-like particles    
 
       Let  us  consider  the  plane  electromagnetic  wave  moving  on  y -  axis  [1,2].    In  the  general 
case it has two polarizations and contains the following field vectors:

        As  it  is  follows  from  previous  paper  [1],  due  to  the  curvilinear  motion  of  the 
electromagnetic wave, some additional terms K, corresponding to the tangent components of the 
displacement current, will appear in the equation (4.6), so that from (4.6) we have: 

        (
2mc  is half of electromagnetic wave (photon) energy. Thus, in the case of 
where
the  curvilinear  motion  of  the  electromagnetic  field  (photon)  instead  of  the  equation  (2.6)  we 
obtain the Klein-Gordon-like equation with mass:  
cmpc !
−
         
Note that ψ-function, which appears after electromagnetic wave twirling, is not identical to the 
'ψ -function before twirling: the 
'ψ -function is the classical electromagnetic wave field and the 
ψ-function is the “electromagnetic spinor” field (see in detail [1,2]) 
       As  it  is  known  the  Klein-Gordon  equation  is  considered  as  the  scalar  field  equation.    But 
obviously 
is  4-matrix  with 
electromagnetic field components, cannot have the sense of the scalar field equation.  Really, let 
us analyze the objects, which this equation describes. 
      From the Maxwell equations follows, that each of the components

 submits to same form of the scalar wave equation. In

this case if it is required to know the changing of one of the vectors components  HE

can consider the vector field as scalar. But in case of CWED, when a tangential current appears,

we cannot proceed to the scalar theory, since the components of a vector  E

       Therefore, although the scalar wave equations (4.8) represent Klein - Gordon equations, the 
equation (4.8) concerning function (4.2) after curvilinear transformation represents the equation 
of  the  vector  particle  with  mass,  which  we  can  name  "heavy"  photon.  Whereas  the  Klein  -

Thus, this part  of the  Lagrangian of lepton is  the self-action  Lagrangian  and is responsible for 
interaction of its own lepton current with its own lepton field. 
        It is easy to generalize this expression in the case of the lepton interaction with an external 
field of other particle. According to the superposition principle of the fields, we have:

        The  first  of the equations  (4.22) corresponds to  the  self-action  of the  "in"-  particle, i.e. to 
interaction of own current of this particle with its own field.  
        It is easy to see, that the second expression from (4.22) describes the interaction of  the "in"- 
particle with the "ex"- particle. As we have shown above, the cross product of vectors of a field 
is responsible for the interaction  of particles  and  leads  to  the current-current interaction.  Using 
the  expression  (
!

,  it  is  not  difficult  to  obtain  the  Dirac  equation  of  lepton  in  an 
ex
external field (see below).  
       Obviously,  the  last  expression  from  (4.22)  describes  the  self-action  of  "ex"-  particles  and 
does not play any role in the description of "in"- particle.

       Comparing the above formulas we can make the following conclusions: 
In the framework of CWED the external field acts as an addition to of the electron’s own current, 
i.e. acts as some external current (we can assume that in the quantum form of the Dirac equation 
the external field can be considered as the addition to the mass of the electron);  
      The  external  field  can  be  considered  as  a  medium  that  has  some  polarization  properties, 
which, obviously, can be characterized by the variable electric and magnetic permeability. In this 
case it is possible to express the additional current through the polarization vectors of medium as 
it is done in classical electrodynamics.  
       From  the  above  following  also  that  in  framework  of  CWED  the  interaction  of  elementary 
particles can be considered as dispersion at their propagation in a medium, which consists from 
other particles (wave optics representation).  
 
 
6.0. Connection of the de Broglie waves refraction index with Hamiltonian 
 
        It is not difficult to see, that in frameworks of CWED the equations (5.1) of interaction of 
the electron with other charged particles (or, in other words, the equations of the electron motion 
in  the  field  of  other  particle)  can  be  presented  in  form  of  the  equations  of  the  classical 
electrodynamics of medium:

      Since the  elementary particles of  CWED  are  the twirled  electromagnetic  waves [1,2], from 
the  above  follows  that  at  their  passage  through  the  medium  the  refraction,  diffraction, 
interference, and also absorption and division of these waves takes place, as for usual light waves 
(i.e.  for  linear  photons).  In  this  case  the  interconversion  of  particles  at  the  collision  can  be 
considered  as  a  dispersion  of  the  curvilinear  waves.  Therefore,  we  can  suppose  that  the 
dispersion matrix of the field theory performs the same role, as a dispersion matrix in optics.

the known Lagrangian density of the photon-photon interaction [18,19] .

       The  Lagrangian  density  (7.17)  coincides  with  the  Nambu  and  Jona-Lasinio  Lagrangian 
density [21], which is the Lagrangian density of the relativistic superconductivity theory. As it is 
known this Lagrangian density is used for the solution of the problem of the elementary particles 
mass appearance by the mechanism of the vacuum symmetry spontaneous breakdown [8].  
       As  it  is  known  [8,  22,23]  the  spontaneous  breaking  of  symmetry  consists  in  the  fact  that 
from  a  massless  vector  field,  which  has  two  spin  states  (such  as  the  linear  photon),  and  a 
massless  scalar  field  φ,  a  massive  vector  particle  with  three  isospin  projections  appears.  It  is 
remarkable, that this break arises at the non-linear interaction of field  φ with itself, whose self-
action energy can be written down as potential  (

(7.18) 
2φ is  isoscalar,      λ    is  a  dimensionless  parameter,      η      is  a  parameter  with  the 
where     
dimension of the mass. It is easy to see the analogies of the spontaneous breaking of symmetry 
with description of the pair production process in CWED [2]. 
 
 
8.0. The general case of non-linear field theory Lagrangian and Hamiltonian 
of interaction   
 
      As we noted, the Hamiltonian is the full system energy. For example, in case of interaction of 
two elementary particles this energy consists of the sum of three parts: the researched particle’s 
own energy, the energy of its interaction with another particle and the energy of the interaction 
of  a  researched  particle  with  physical  vacuum  (the  last  term  corresponds  to  the  account  of  the 
polarization of physical vacuum). 
       As  we  have  shown  in  general  case  the  CWED  is  the  non-linear  theory.      Therefore  the 
Lagrangian  of  a  system  must  contain  all  possible  terms  with  the  invariants  of  electromagnetic 
field.

where
       Hamiltonian  is  fully  defined  through  the  Lagrangian  of  a  system.  If  the  function  (8.1)  is 
known, using the formula (1.13), it is easy to calculate the Hamiltonian of the system, which will 
be now, obviously, the function of the various powers of electromagnetic field vectors  
 
 
     Apparently,  for  each  problem  the  function 
same happens with the form of the function Ηf
      It has appeared, that the approximate form of the function  Ηf
Schroedinger (or Dirac) wave equation, using the so-called perturbation method.        
      Generally this procedure has the following form. It is supposed, that there is an expansion of 
 in Taylor – MacLaurent power series with unknown expansion coefficient. Then 
the function Ηf
the problem is reduced to the calculation of these coefficients. The solution is searched for each 
term of expansion separately, starting with the first. Usually for the first term of expansion this is 
a problem for a free particle, whose solution is already known. Then using the equation with the 
two first terms, we find the coefficient of the second term of expansion. Then, using the equation 
for  the  three  first  terms,  we  find  the  coefficient  for  the  third  term  of  expansion,  etc.  As  it  is 
known by this method it is possible to obtain the solution with any desirable accuracy.

assume, that each element of series has some constant physical sense. In this case it is possible to

Conclusion 
 
       The  above  results  show  that  in  framework  of  CWED  there  is  the  uniform  description  of                        
fields’ interaction. As we can see the descriptions of the interactions, used in different sections of 
physics (mechanics, classical electrodynamics, quantum electrodynamics, etc.), are equivalent. It 
appears also that the interaction can be expressed by field strengths, potentials, wave functions, 
currents,  energy-momentum  tensor,  stress,  medium  polarization  index  etc.  This  allows  us  to 
speak about CWED as about the unified field theory.

Transverse redshift effects without special relativity 
Eric Baird  (eric_baird@compuserve.com) 

Transverse redshift effects are sometimes presented as being unique to special relativity 
(the "transverse Doppler effect"). We argue that if the detector is aimed at 90 degrees in 
the laboratory frame, most theories will predict a redshifted frequency at the detector, 
although these predictions can be concealed by specifying that angles should be defined 
in a frame other than the laboratory frame. These redshifts are often stronger than 
special relativity's predictions. We list some of the situations in which lab-transverse 
redshifts would be expected. 

 
1.  Introduction 
According to Einstein’s special theory, light-
signals coming from an object moving in the 
laboratory frame should have an increased 
wavelength when they arrive at a transversely-
aimed lab-frame detector [1]. These “transverse 
redshifts” are sometimes presented as being a 
unique feature of special relativity,  
e.g. Rosser 1964:  

“… According to the theory of special relativity, if a 
beam of atoms which is emitting light is observed in a 
direction which according to the observer is at right 
angles to the direction of relative motion, then the 
frequency of the light should differ from the 
frequency the light would have if the source were at 
rest relative to the observer.  This is the transverse 
Doppler effect. According to the classical ether 
theories there should be no change in frequency in 
this case.” [2] 

Other reference texts agree that transverse 
redshifts should not occur in classical theory 
[3][4], but are less specific about how the word 
“transverse” should be interpreted.   

We show that Rosser’s statement is incorrect, 
and that not only are “laboratory-transverse” 
redshift predictions common to a range of 
models, but that many of these predicted 
redshifts are stronger than their “special 
relativity” counterparts. 

In this paper, we briefly look at and list the lab-
transverse predictions of a number of different 
models.  

2.  “Stationary” and “moving” 
aether predictions 

“Aberration shift”  
If we assume that light travels throughout space 
at c relative to the observed object, aberration 
effects cause an observer aiming their detector 
at 90° degrees in their own frame to see more 
of the “back-side” of the moving object, and 
can lead to the observer expecting to see a 
partial recession redshift [5] (e.g.: Lodge   
 “… Doppler effect caused by motion of the 
observer is … a case of common aberration.” 

1893 [6]  “ .. a spurious or apparent Doppler 
effect.” 1909 [7] ).  

We can rederive these effects by starting with 
special relativity (which “relativises” the 
stationary-aether and moving-aether 
calculations) and working backwards to find 
the original moving-aether predictions.  

Non-transverse shift tests 
Special relativity’s transverse predictions are 
sometimes tested experimentally by measuring 
the non-transverse (“radial”) frequency shift 
relationships, and then analysing the data to 
find a residual Lorentz component after first-
order propagation effects have been accounted 
for [8]-[14].  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 

The three main Doppler equations for the 
apparent frequency f ’ and apparent front-back 
depth d’ of a receding or approaching radiating 
object [15][16][17], with v as recession 
velocity, are: 
      d’/ d  =  f ’/ f   =  (c-v) / c 
) (
/

      d’/ d  =  f ’/ f   = 

(
vc

… (1) 

)v

+

  … (2) 

      d’/ d  =  f ’/ f   =  c / (c+v) 

… (3) 

Special relativity’s “relativistic Doppler” 
predictions (2) are the root-product average of 
the predictions associated with “absolute 
aether”s that are  i) stationary in the emitter’s 
frame (1) and ii) stationary in the observer’s 
frame (3) [18]. 

Any model that generates the first-order 
Doppler equation (1) should give a residual 
Lorentz-squared redshift when stationary-
aether propagation effects (3) are divided out, a 
stronger result than special relativity’s single 
residual Lorentz redshift.  

In the case of Ives-Stilwell 1938 [8], the mean 
position of approach- and recession shifted 
spectral lines gives a central position that is not 
affected by velocity with (3), and that has 
velocity-dependent positional offsets with (1) 
and (2).

Transverse motion  
The same relationships should hold for data 
taken at other angles in the laboratory frame – 
any “special relativity” result should be 
interpretable either as a stationary-aether 
propagation effect supplemented by a Lorentz 
redshift (time-dilation of the moving emitter), 
or as a moving-aether propagation shift 
supplemented by a Lorentz blueshift (time-
dilation of the moving observer’s reference-
clocks).  

Where the special theory predicts a lab-
transverse Lorentz redshift, an unmodified 
“moving-aether” model should (again) predict  
a Lorentz-squared lab-transverse redshift  
(Note: all viewing angles must be specified in  
a particular frame to avoid aberration issues, 
otherwise this approach will fail [18] ).  

3.  Emitter-theory 
If we are only observing a single object, the 
simplest predictions for a “ballistic light-
corpuscle” model superimposed on flat 
spacetime should coincide with the predictions 
for an absolute aether moving with the object  
(lab-transverse Lorentz-squared redshift). 

4.  Dragged-light models  
If light is completely dragged by a particle-
cloud or object, we should again expect the 
most extreme scenario (where dragging is 
effectively absolute over extended regions of 
space), to be equivalent to a “moving aether” 
model, giving us a Lorentz-squared lab-
transverse redshift.  

Dragged-light models producing weaker 
dragging effects (or with more “democratic” 
dragging characteristics) should produce 
correspondingly weaker lab-transverse 
frequency changes.  

5.  Relativistic calculations using 
the emitter-theory shift equation 
In another paper, we have derived the 
relativistic aberration and wavelength-changes 
associated with (1), (2) and (3) [19]. In that 
exercise, the relativistic application of the 
emitter-theory equation is once again 
associated with a Lorentz-squared “lab-
transverse” redshift prediction.  

In a round-trip version of the experiment 
(where a signal is aimed and the reflection 
received at 90° in the same frame), (1) gives a 
double Lorentz redshift and special relativity 
gives a null result [19]. 

6.  Gravitational redshifts 
Verifications of general relativity’s gravity-
shift predictions are sometimes used as indirect 
supporting evidence in favour of the special 
theory. 

The prediction that light from high-gravity stars 
should be seen to be spectrally shifted was 
made by John Michell in 1783, and again by 
Einstein in 1910 [20].  If we calculate the 
strength of the effect by dropping an object 
across a gravitational gradient and using 
Doppler equation (1) to calculate its final 
motion shift (Einstein [21], MTW [22] §7.2), 
we get a one-way gravity-shift prediction of 
D E=~gh/c2 (good Earth-surface 
approximation), and D E=2gh/c2  for round-trip 
shifts (exact relationship) [23]. 

Verifications of these relationships are often 
considered to be verifications of general 
relativity [24][25], although they do not depend 
on general relativity’s mathematics, special 
relativity’s frequency-shift relationships, or the 
principle of relativity.  

7.  Centrifugal redshifts  
The equivalence principle requires that 
centrifugal redshifts must be calculable from 
gravitational principles [26], because of the 
apparent outward gravitational field seen in the 
rotating frame (the “Coriolis field” [27]).  

If we attach two clocks to the centre and to the 
rim of a rotating disc, observers in the disc’s 
rotating frame are entitled to claim that the disc 
is immersed in a effective gravitational field 
that pulls objects away from the rotation axis. 
We can then apply the general arguments given 
in Einstein’s 1911 gravity-shift paper for 
signals passed through this field [21] to argue 
that the perimeter clock must run more slowly 
than the central clock. 

These calculations do not require special 
relativity. 

Huyghens’ principle and 
gravitation 
If two light-clocks do have a genuine 
measurable difference in clock-rate, we can 
apply Huyghens’ principle to the apparent 
lightspeed differential between the two regions 
and predict a deflection of lightrays towards the 
slower clock [21][28]. By this argument, an 
effective gravitational field should be present in 
any experiment producing physical clock-rate 
differences.

8.  Other rotating-body problems 
Similar considerations apply to the Hafele-
Keating experiment [29][30] and other 
experiments involving the comparison of rates 
of clocks orbiting with and against the earth’s 
rotation (e.g. GPS and other satellite-based 
systems  [31] §3 pp.54-64). 

If a clock-rate difference is large enough to be 
deemed “significant”, then the geometrical 
deviation from flat spacetime should be 
considered to be equally ”significant” (since the 
former should be calculable from the latter). 

Einstein’s equatorial clocks 
The issue of gravitational-equivalence is nicely 
illustrated by the example in section 4 of the 
“electrodynamics” paper, in which Einstein 
suggests that a clock at the earth’s equator 
should tick more slowly than one at the pole.  

If we are using sea-level clocks, these 
gravitational effects conspire to make the effect 
disappear [32] – if a sea-level clock-rate 
differential is associated with a gravitational 
gradient, the earth’s oceans should flow 
“downhill” across this time-dilation gradient 
towards the equator, only reaching equilibrium 
when all parts of the ocean surface have the 
same clock rate (the resulting equatorial bulge 
should, of course, also be calculable from more 
conventional “centrifugal force” arguments).   

More complex problems 
Although it is useful to be able to calculate 
clock-lags by assuming flat spacetime and 
applying a Lorentz correction, the success of 
this approach over small regions does not mean 
that these are intrinsically flat-space problems 
(cartographers once used similar equations to 
compensate for the Earth’s curvature, but their 
success did not prove that the Earth’s surface 
“really was” flat). We would suggest that where 
“flat” and “gravitational” arguments disagree, 
the second approach may have greater validity.   

The calculation of route-dependent 
gravitational effects from apparent clock rate 
differences is a much more complex subject, 
[33][34] and is beyond the scope of this paper. 

9.  Thermal redshifts 
Similar arguments can be applied to the case of 
the thermal second order Doppler effect in Fe57 
[25][35]. If the Fe57 atoms have “significant” 
velocities while locked into a “stationary” 
crystal lattice, then they must also be 
continually undergoing “significant” 
accelerations. 

10.  Muon lifetimes 
“Muon-decay” experiments are widely cited in 
textbooks as supporting evidence of special 
relativity’s time-dilation predictions [36].  
C.M. Will [31] Appendix: pp.245-257: 

“But the [upper atmospheric] muon is so 
unstable that it would decay long before 
reaching sea level … if it weren’t for the 
time dilation of special relativity, which 
increases its lifetime as a consequence of its 
high velocity.”   

This statement about the time-dilated muon 
depends on the assumption that the speed of 
light is “really” fixed in the observer’s frame – 
but since the special theory ought to predict the 
same outcome when we assume that lightspeed 
is fixed in the object’s frame, we are also 
entitled to claim, with equal validity, that the 
muon’s ageing rate is anomalously fast, and 
that (with a fixed lightspeed in the muon frame) 
the muon would actually penetrate further, if is 
was not for the time-compaction effect of 
special relativity! 

The “muon” statement obviously involves a 
certain amount of interpretation being applied 
to the experimental data. If we return for a 
moment to Newtonian mechanics, the muon’s 
decay position x for a given Newtonian rest 
mass m, particle lifetime t and momentum p, is 
(with v=p/m)   x = vt = pt/m.  

Calculating the equivalent decay point under 
special relativity with x’ = vSRt’, we have a 
smaller velocity value vSR =p/mg SR [37] and a 
larger (time-dilated) decay time t’=tg SR , with 
the two Lorentz factors cancelling (x’=x). In 
this particular calculation, the effect of the 
time-dilation path-lengthening effect is to 
compensate for the path-contraction due to 
special relativity’s reduced nominal velocity 
values, so that the muon’s decay position is as 
it would have been under Newtonian 
mechanics.    

11.  “SR-similar” aether models 
Although this paper is intended to be about 
recognisably “non-SR” models, we should also 
mention that there are a range of “Lorentzian” 
aether models that also incorporate time-
dilation effects (see e.g.  [38]-[40] and many 
articles in dissident journals). Many of these 
models only predict small or non-existent 
deviations from special relativity. Where they 
agree exactly, the special theory is usually 
assumed to be preferable because of its reduced 
number of physical assumptions. 39 40 41 42

12.  “Physical” and “interpreted”  
       time dilations 
The distinction between “physically-verifiable” 
time dilation effects and “interpreted” time 
dilation effects is not always obvious.  

In the case of “moving aether” calculations, the 
“lab-transverse redshift” result is usually 
overlooked, possibly because it seems 
unreasonable that a transverse redshift could be 
detected if the emitter was not “really” ageing 
more slowly. Since a rectilinearly-moving 
point-particle only has transverse motion with 
respect to a point-observer for a vanishingly 
short period of time, these shifts do not have to 
be “sustainable”, and do not have to be 
associated with “real” clock-rate differences.  

In the “muon” case, time-dilation seems to be  
an “interpreted” property, whose reality 
depends on the statement that the speed of light 
is “really” locked to the observer’s own frame 
– this statement cannot be physically verified 
without breaking the principle of relativity.  

In the case of a relativistic model based on the 
moving-aether equations (e.g. this author 
[33][34]), time dilation is more difficult to pin 
down, as this class of model seems to require a 
non-Euclidean spacetime in which relative 
ageing rates can be route-dependent.  

General Summary: 
In general: 

a)   We can test the correctness of the special 

theory’s shift equations, but cannot isolate 
an unambiguous physical difference in 
clock rates unless the experiment involves 
gravitation or acceleration.  
In the absence of these effects, the “time-
dilation” results are interpretative. 

b)   If two physical light-clocks do have a 
verifiable difference in clock rate, then 
Huyghens’ principle applied to this 
apparent lightspeed differential should give 
us a description of a gravitational gradient 
between the two clocks, and the problem 
can be treated as a gravitational exercise 
without involving special relativity.   

Exception - “twins” problem 
The one possible exception to this rule seems 
to be the original version of the infamous 
“twin,” “astronaut,” or “clock” problem ([43] 
[44], [37] §4.6 pp.125-126), where a traveller 
coasts away from their twin at a constant v m/s, 
experiences a sudden abrupt acceleration that  
 

reverses their course, and then coasts back to 
their twin’s position at a constant speed of  
-v m/s.  

In special relativity’s analysis of the problem, 
the returning twin shows a final clock-lag equal 
to the total nominal time-dilation effect 
accumulated during the constant-velocity 
stages of its journey. It is difficult to model this 
outcome gravitationally, since the application 
of gravitational effects to signals belonging to 
the slow astronaut’s coasting stages can 
undermine the special theory’s calculations 
[45][46]. If we assume that the sudden 
acceleration of the traveller produces a shift-
inducing gravitational field effect, the 
characteristics of this abruptly-introduced field 
are not straightforward [47]. The situation is 
also difficult to test experimentally. 

The favoured GR approach to the problem 
seems to be to amend the experiment so that the 
traveller does not coast, but experiences a 
constant acceleration throughout the journey 
(MTW [22] §6.2-6.6  pp.166-176.).  
This, of course, brings us back to a situation 
where all of the final measurable clock-
difference is accumulated while the object is 
accelerating.

14.  CONCLUSIONS 
A small amount of investigation shows that 
transverse redshifts (where “transverse” means 
“transverse in the laboratory frame”) do seem 
to appear in most models – of those considered 
here, only one (flat absolute aether stationary in 
the observer frame) is not immediately 
associated with a lab-transverse redshift 
prediction.   

Although it might be considered convenient to 
dismiss many of these redshift predictions by 
specifying that the “transverse” detector should 
be aimed at an angle other than 90° in the 
laboratory frame, this introduces an additional 
level of interpretation and theory-dependence 
into our experiments, and invites confusion 
about which sets of predictions apply to which 
experiments. 

Since some of these redshift predictions belong 
to models that predate special relativity and 
produce stronger lab-transverse redshifts than 
Einstein’s special theory, casual statements that 
“transverse redshifts only appear under special 
relativity” need to be treated with a certain 
amount of trepidation.

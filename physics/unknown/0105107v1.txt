Abstract 

A  shape  of  the  signals  in  proportional  chamber  with  preamplification  gap  and  electron 
component  extraction  from  proportional  discharge  has  been  investigated.  It  was  shown  for  Penning 
mixtures that in proportional discharge besides the primary avalanches there is also the tail of secondary 
avalanches caused by metastable and nonmetastable Penning effects. For different mixtures of gases the

duration  of the  signals caused by secondary avalanches are equal to ~  n ·10 
charge of secondary avalanches is comparable or larger than in primary avalanches.

The  generally  accepted  picture  for  signal  formation  in  proportional  counters  and 
chambers  is  the  following.  The  ionization  electrons  which  drift  in  the  electric  field  to 
the  anode  wire,  are  multiplied  in  the  primary  avalanches  in  high  electric  field  near  the 
anode  and  are  collected  at  the  anode.  The  production  of  exited  states  of  gas  atoms  and 
molecules  takes  place  in  the  process  of  the  avalanches  developing.  For  the  mixture  of 
noble  gas  X  with  the  gas  M  which  has  the  ionization  potential  less  than  the  energy  of 
exited  metastable  states  of  NG  -atoms  or  less  than  the  energy  of  photons,  emitted  by 
exited  NG-atoms  and  molecules,  (the  Penning  mixtures)  the  secondary  avalanches  are 
produced  owing  to  collisions  of  long  living  metastable  NG-atoms  Xm  with  atoms  or 
molecules of the gas M:

These  secondary  processes  are  described  in  works  with  proportional  counters 
and  chambers  [1–5].  But  the  time  structure  of  these  processes  was  not  measured  because 
the  shape  of  proportional  signals 
is  mainly 
determined  by  slow  motion  of  the  positive  ions  from  the  anode,  and  the  slow  secondary 
signals can not be extracted from the positive ions signals in this case.

signals is measured. 

 

 
I. Proportional chamber with extraction of the electron component of the signal 

The  proportional  chamber  with  preamplification  gap  and  with  extraction  of  the 
electron  component  of  the  signal  [6  –  8]  was  used  in  the  measurements  (Fig.1).  The 
chamber  containes  the  cathode  1  with  an  a(b)
-source  2  on  it;  the  drift  gap  with  rings  3 
which  provide  a  uniform  electric  field;  the  preamplification  gap  between  cathode  4  and 
anode  5;  the  transfer  gap  5-6  and  the  detecting  induction  gap  6-7. The cathode 1 has a   
(cid:215) s–1     
4 mm  –  diameter  collimating  opening, behind which a  239Pu  a
flux rate or a  63  Ni    b
(cid:215) s-1 flux rate is installed at a distance of  10 
  - source with a  ~
mm.  The  multiwire  proportional  gap  (MWPG)  used  for  electron  multiplication  contains 
the  cathode  4  wound  with  a  2  mm  pitch  of  a  beryllium  bronze  0.1  mm  diameter  wire. 
The  anode  5  is  winded  of  a  20  m m  diameter  W  +  Au  wire  with  a  2  mm  pitch.  The 
MWPG  is  equal  to  2  mm.  In  projection,  the  anode  wires  are  parallel  to  cathode  wires 
and  exactly  in  the  middle  between  them.  The  transfer  gap  is  equal  to  9  mm.  The  cathode 
6  of  the  detecting  gap  is  winded  of  a  0.1  mm  diameter  wire  with  a  1  mm  pitch.  The 
width  of  the  gap  6-7  is  2  mm.  The  distribution  of  voltage  between  the  electrodes  of  the 
chamber is determined by resistor divider shown in Fig. 1.

The  electric  field  distribution  in  the  chamber  look  like  to  that  in  the  widely  used 

chambers [7]. 

The  ionization  electrons  from  a

(b )  –  particle  track  drift  in  the  proportional  gap 
and  are  multiplied  at  the  anode  wires  5.  The  electron  charge  in  transfer  gap  5-6 arises 
owing  to  electrostatic  and  photon  mechanisms  [7].  From  transfer  gap  the  electrons  drift 
into  the  detecting  gap  6-7.  The  electric  field  intensity  in  this  gap  is  insufficient  for 
evolving  avalanches  and  the  gap  records  the  electrons  without  multiplication,  i.e.  in  the 
induction operation mode of the ionization chamber. 

The  drift  velocity  of    electrons  in  gap  6-7  is  very  high  (~ 106  cm(cid:215) s-1)  for  utilized 
gas  mixtures  and  for  electric  field  intensities  in  the  gap  (>  1  kV(cid:215) cm-1).  Owing  to  this  the 
time  resolution  of  the  chamber  is  equal  to  ~  0.2  cm  /  (106  cm(cid:215) s-1)  =  2(cid:215) 10-7 s. Thus, the 
time  structure  of  proportional  discharge  is  measured  with  accuracy  ~  2(cid:215) 10-7s by chamber 
shown in Fig. 1. 

The  signals  from  the  anode  of  the  detecting  gap  are  fed  to  the  charge  – sensitive 
amplifier  BUS2-96  that  has  the  differentiating  constant  equal  to  1  ms  and  after 
amplification the signals are detected by memory oscilloscope C 9-8. 

During  the  measurements  the  chamber  was  being  filled    with  different  gases  (see 
Table  1).  The  used  gases  were  purified  from  impurities  up  to  very  low  level.  The 
oxygen  was  removed  from  all  gases  by  an  adsorbent  Ni/SiO 2  up  to  a  level  of  about  10-10 
rel.  vol.  parts  [9].  The  gases  He,  Ne  were  purified  of  all  impurities  by  fine  filtration  at  a 
temperature  of  78  K  [10].  The  Ar  and  Xe  were  purified  of  all  chemical  active  impurities 
up  to  a  level  of  ~  10-9    rel.  vol.  parts  by  Ca at high temperatures (500-700o C) [11]. The 
Ar  was  also  purified  of  all  impurities    up  to  a  level  of  ~  10-9    rel.  vol.  parts  by  synthetic 
zeolites NaA-6 at a temperature of 90 K [12]. 

The  impurities    CH4,  C2H2,  C2H4  and  other  hydrocarbons  and  H2    were  removed 
from  Ar,  Xe  up  to  a  level  of  ~  10-9  rel.  vol.  parts  by  NiO/SiO 2  –  adsorbent  at  the 
temperature  of  ~  450o C. The reaction   CnHm + NiO  ﬁ
 CO2 + H2O + Ni takes place in 
this  adsorbent.  The  water  was  removed  from  all  gases  up  to  a  level  of  ~  10-4  torr  by   

 

2

-
silica-gel.  The  oxygen  was  removed  from  H2O  up  to  a  level  of  ~  10-13  rel.  molar  parts 
by Ni/SiO 2 – adsorbent  at the temperature of ~ 200oC [13]. 

The  purification  systems  for  all  these  methods  were  constructed  from  stainless 

steel. 

All  vessels,  pipes  of  the  purification  systems  and  chamber  were  heated  and 

pumped out up to high vacuum before measurements. 

In  measurements  three  kinds  of  the  signals  shape  were  obtained  (Fig.  2a,b,c).  For 
all  signals  the  quantity    D
t1  is  the  duration  of  ionization  electrons  collection    from  the 
particle  track  on  the  anode  5  of  the  chamber,  i.e.  this  quantity  is  the  duration  of  the 
signal caused by primary avalanches. 

The quantity  D

t2  is  the  duration  of  the  secondary  avalanches.  Point  1  in  Fig.  2  a, 

b corresponds to the end of the primary avalanches. 

The  shape  of  the  secondary  signals  is  exponential.  The  total  charge  of  the 
secondary  avalanches  is  equal  to  ~  50-70  %  of  the  total  charge  in  the  proportional  signal 
for the saturation region in dependence of admixture concentration. 

The  recorded  signal  for  the  mixture  Ne  +  30%  H2  (see  Table  I)  is  shown  in  Fig. 

3. 
          From the analysis of the experimental data the following conclusions can be 
made: 
1.  The results obtained with a  - source and b
 - source do not qualitatively differ; 
2.  The secondary avalanches are produced in Penning mixtures – in our case Ar + 

C2H2, He + CH4, Ne + H2, Ar + Xe, Ne + Ar + CH4 , N2 + Ar + TMAE, Ar + CH4); 

3.  The minimum admixture concentration with a low ionization potential, that gives 

4. 

secondary effects, may rich about 1 ppm (Ar + 1ppm C2H2); 
 The secondary avalanches take place in gases CH4, N2 + 10% C2H2  and CF4 + 5% 
izo – C4H10 at a sacrifice of micro-admixtures of Ar (about of a several ppm) in 
commercial gases CH4, N2 and CF4 which were purified in these experiments of O2 
– admixture only;  

5.  The mixture CF4 + 5% izo – C4H10 is apparently Penning one because the excited 

molecules CF4 are the intensive source of UV-photons [14]; 

6.  The value of the total charge in the secondary processes depends on the 

concentration  of admixture with a low ionization potential. For example, the total 
charge of secondary avalanches for the mixture Ar + 0.25 % C2H2 is equal to ~ 50% 
of the total charge in the proportional signal, but for the mixture Ar + 1ppm C2H2 – 
only 10%. The total charge of the secondary avalanches for the mixture Ne + 10% 
H2 (Pabs = 4 bar) is equal to ~ 66% as compared with 20% for the mixture Ne + 10 
ppm H2;   

7.  The  duration  of  the  secondary  processes  decreases  with  increasing  of  the  electric 

field intensity in the proportional gap (Fig.4); 

8.  The  duration  of  secondary  processes  does  not  practically  depend  on  the  drift  electric 

field intensity; 

9.  The  duration  of  secondary  processes  does  not  practically  depend  on 

the 
concentration  of  the  admixture  with  a  low  ionization  potential  for  the  high  values  of 
concentration.  For  example,  the  quantity  D
t2  does  not  change  in  mixtures  Ar  + 
t2    for  mixtures  Ar  +  (1‚ 20)  ppm  C2H2  is equal 
(10‚ 0.01)%  CH4. But the quantity  D

more detail; 

10. Secondary  Penning  effects  are  absent  in  the  one-component  pure  gases  (N2,  Ne,  H2, 
He,  Ar,  C2H2)  and  in  mixtures  of  pure  molecular  gases  (H2  +  0.5%  C2H2, H2 + 10% 
CH4,  N2 + 33 ppm TMAE). 

 
 

 

II. Proportional discharge in the uniform electric field 

The  shape  of  the  proportional  avalanche  discharge  signal  in  the  uniform  electric 
field  was  measured  with  the  chamber  shown  in  Fig.5.  The  signals  with  parameters  D
t 1 
= 0.6  m s and  D
t 2  =  10.5  m s  (see  Fig.6)  were  obtained  for  the  chamber  filling  Ar  +  1% 
C2H2  (Pabs  =  1  bar)  and  for  voltages  on  electrodes  Van  =  500  V,  Vcath =  -200 V. The 
shape of these signals is the same as in Fig.2a. 

The  signals  with  D

t 1  =  3  m s,  D

t 2  = 25  m s  were  obtained  for  the  filling  760  torr 

Ar + 4,5 torr H2O and for the voltages on electrodes Van = 500 V, Vcath = -600 V. 

It  is  necessary  to  note  that  coincidence  of  the  signal  shape  in  parallel-plate 
chamber  with  the  shape  of  the  electron  component  of  the  proportional  discharge  in 
chamber  shown  in  Fig.1  gives  an  evidence  for  weak  influence  of  the  ion  component  of 
proportional  discharge  on  the  signal  shape  in  the  parallel-plate  chamber.  This  result 
comes to an agreement with the results obtained in [15]. 

The  signals  with  D

t1  =  0.5  m s  and  without    the  secondary  avalanches  were 
obtained  with  the  pure  Ar-filling  at  the  pressure  of  1  bar  and  with  voltages  on  the 
electrodes Van = 500 V, Vcath = -200 V. 

The  authors  [16]  have  observed    secondary  Penning  avalanches  in  parallel-plate 
chamber  for  mixture  Ar  +  6  torr  TEA,  but  they  affirm,  that  secondary  Penning 
avalanches  are  absent  in  mixture  Ar  +  10%CH4  and  there  are  in  this  mixture  only  the 
avalanches  which  are  produced  by  photoelectrons  from  cathode  of  the  chamber.  Our 
there  are  
measurements  with  chamber  shown 
secondary  avalanches  in  mixtures  Ar  +  (0.01  ‚
  10)%  CH4  at  the  sacrifice  of  Penning 
effects in the gas phase.

t 1  =  0.3 
m s,  D
t 2  =  17  m s  (Fig.8)  were  obtained  by  irradiation  with  the  electrons  of  the  chamber 
with  a  filling  He  +  10%  N2  +  100  ppm  Xe  (Pabs    =  1  bar)  and  with  voltages  on  the 
electrodes  Van  =  5.2  kV,  Vcath  =  -220  V.  This  result  confirms  the  existence  of  the 
secondary  avalanches  in  Penning  mixtures.  The  shape  of  these  signals  is  the  same  as  in 
Fig.2a. 

the  photons 

The  authors  [17]  have  observed  fast  and  slow  component  of  the  electro-
luminescence  in  Ar.  This  result  can  be  explained,  if  one  suggests,  that  there  was  some 
admixture with a low ionization  potential in Ar used for this experiment.

The  observed  secondary  avalanches  can  only  be  explained  by  Penning  effects 

because: 

1.  The secondary avalanches take place in Penning mixtures only, 
2.  The  secondary  effects  are  delayed    relative  to  primary  avalanches  like  the 

3. 

expected behaviour for Penning effects, 
 These  effects  can  not  be  explained  by  photoelectrons  from  the  cathode, 
because secondary avalanches are not observed for pure gases He, Ne, Ar.  
From  our  results  and  the  results  of  work  [1]  one  can  offer  the  following 
mechanism  for  the  development  of  the  secondary  avalanches  in  Penning  mixtures. 
* takes 
Among  other  processes  the  excitation  of  the  NG  atoms  X  in  metastable  states  Xm
place  in  the  primary  avalanches.  The  metastable  Penning  effect  (2)  takes  place  when 
*  are  colliding  with  the  neutral  molecules  M  of  the  admixture  that  have  the 
atoms  Xm
ionization potential less than the excitation energy of the Xm

*  atoms. 

 

The  excitation  of  the  NG  atoms  and  molecules  also  occurs  in  avalanches  with  the 
following  photons  emitting  [18]  (processes  (3),  (4)).  These  photons  ionize  the  molecules 
of impurities if their ionization potential less than the energy of photons (process (5)). 

The  electrons  from  processes  (2)  and  (5)  produce  the  secondary    avalanches  that 
in  turn  give  the  new  excited  states  of  NG  atoms.  As  a  result  the  avalanches  are  repeated 
many  times  during  D
  (1‚ 10)· 10  m s.  The  delays  in  the  appearance  of  the  secondary 
avalanches  are  caused  by  the  finite  time  of  life  of  the  metastable  states  and  also  by 
photons  emitted  in direction to the cathode.  

t 2  @

At  the  moment  of  transition  from  the  primary    avalanches  to  the  secondary 
avalanches  a  break  in  the  shape  of  the  signals  takes  place  (point  1  in  Fig.2a,b),  which  is 
caused  by  change  in  the  intensity  for  the  avalanches  production.  But  it  is  necessary  to 
note  that  it  is  possible  to  make  the  rise  time  of  the  primary  signal  equal  to  that  of  the 
secondary signal in point 1 by change of the drift electric field intensity.  

The  decrease  of  the  secondary  processes  duration  with  the  increase  of    the 
electric  field  intensity  in  the  proportional  gap  (Fig.4)  is  caused  by  the  acceleration  of  the 
entire process of proportional discharge development. 

The  increase  of  the  volume  of  positive  ion  cloud  at  a  sacrifice    of  the  secondary 
avalanches  and  as  a  consequence  the  increase  of  its  screening  effect  leads  to  a  stop  of 
the secondary avalanches, that is to a stop of the proportional discharge. 

For one  –  component  pure  gases  (N2,  Ne,  H2,  Ar,  He,  C2H2  and  so  on)  and  for 
mixtures  of  pure  molecular  gases  the  duration  of  proportional  signal  is  equal  to  the 
duration  of  primary  avalanches.  In  this  case  the  stop  of  the  proportional  discharge  is 
caused  by  stopping  of  the  arriving  to  the  anode  of  ionization  electrons  from  particle 
track.

In  conclusion  we  compare  our  results  with  the  results  obtained  in  work  [10],

conditions  for  the  mixtures  of  He  with  Ar,  Kr,  CO2,  Xe,  N2,  C2H4,  H2,  of  Ne  with  H2,

admixtures  ‡
  2·10 –4    rel.  vol.  parts  there  is  an  increase  of ionization electrons output up 
to  40%  as  compared  with  the  pure  He,  Ne,  Ar.  Authors  explain  this  additional  ionization 
by  production  of  metastable  atoms  with  following  process  (1).  The  authors  also  note 
that  micro-admixtures  in  commercial  gases  increase  the  ionization  output,  if  these  gases 
are  used  for  chamber  filling  without  addition    of  another  gases.  For  removal  of  micro-
admixtures  influence  the  gases  He,  Ne,  H2  were  purified  by  fine  filtration  at  a 
temperature of 78 K.

Abstract

In considering a social network, there are cases where people is transferred to another place. Then the
physical (direct) relations among nodes are lost by the movement. In terms of a network theory, some
nodes break the present connections with neighboring nodes, move and there build new connections of
nodes. For simplicity we here consider only that two nodes exchange the place each other on a network.
Such exchange is assumed to be constantly carried out. We study this dynamic network (node exchange
network NEN) and uncover some new features which usual networks do not contain. We mainly consider
average path length and the diameter. Lastly we consider a propagation of one virus on the network by a
computer simulation. They are compared to other networks investigated hitherto. The relation to a scale
free network is also discussed.

1 Introduction

In a social network, we need to consider the possibility that people is transferred to another place. Then the

physical (direct) relations among them are lost by the movement. In terms of a network theory, this means that

some nodes break the present connections with neighboring nodes, move and there build new connections of

nodes. For simplicity we here consider only that two nodes exchange the place each other on a network. Such

exchange is assumed to be constantly carried out. We study this dynamic network (node exchange network

NEN) to uncover some new features which usual networks do not contain. Then we introduce a handy

network that has essentially same properties as random networks, instead of random networks. We mainly

consider average distance between any pairs of nodes and the diameter. Lastly we study the phenomenology

by computer simulation that one virus on the network spreads throughout the network. They are compared

to other networks including the handy network, regular lattice and the small world network (SW-NET)[4],[5],

and furthermore the relation to a scale free network (SF-NET)[1],[2],[3], is discussed.

2 Node Exchange Network; NEN

As explained in the previous section, we consider that nodes exchange each other on a regular network. This

network seems to look like a small world network. However it is necessarily not the case. By the movement, the

nodes and the edges accompanied with them are entirely cut, and the nodes are connected with new edges each

other. Notice that a network topology is apparently invariant under the procedure. In small world networks

the static properties are only pursured but the dynamic properties are rather important in the NEN.

The alghorism for formulating this network is as follows;

1. Prepare a regular (one dimensional )network with a periodic boundary condition. This is like a ring.

2. Randomly choose two nodes on it at random and exchange them. This procedure is repeated Q times.

3. Evaluate correct quantities of the network.

1

4. 1∼3, which is one round, is repeated M times.

In such a way the network is analyzed dynamically.

3 Results of Simulation

We show the results of computer simulations. First of all we evaluate a diameter D and the average distance

between any pairs of nodes L of the NEN . Both of them should show the same behaviours essentially in static

networks. In the case, however, it may necessarily not be so, because to measure D take more steps than to

measure L and the networka are essentially diﬀernt after diﬀerent time steps in a dynamic network.

Before doing computer simulation, we conveniently introduce a network ”random graph with ﬁxed de-

gree”, RNFD. Usualy the degree distribution of random networks is the Poisson distribution in the limit of

a large network size n → ∞. Then a diameter behaves as

log n
log<k> where < k > is an average degree[6].
This behaviour, however, only appears in the large n and so we introduce more handy model with the same

properties essentially as random networks. This is RNFD that exhibits essentially the same behaviours as

random networks for smaller n. This is shown by doing simulation later. In RNFD, each node has exactly

same number of links, that is the degree k, but they are randomly connected with other nodes. In terms of an

adjacency matrix, it is a symmetric matrix with randomly k elements of 1 in each column and row. We use

this handy model to study network properties after this.

Fig.1 shows diameters D vs. size n of the NEN constructed from degree k = 4 regular lattice and RNFD

with degree k = 4, respectively. In Fig.1, points and curved lines show simulation data and approximate curve,

respectively. This show that n dependence of D in the NEN is exponential, while that in RAFD is logarithmic

such as random networks. (Notice that the coeﬃent of log is not 1/ loge k such as random graphs. This result

also means that RNFD is not so small world compared to random networks. ) Their properties are invariant
under changing Q in NEN or k in RNFD. Since it is linear D = n

2k in one dimensional regural lattice with a
periodic boundary condition, NEN is a network intermediate between a regular lattice and random networks

such as SW-NET.

To clear the point we study average distance between any pairs of nodes, which is well investigated in

SW-NET and SF-NET. Fig.2 shows L − n curves of RNFD with k = 4 and NEN with Q = 10 and k = 4.

Figure 3: Average distances between two nodes: The left is an average L of SW-NET with k = 4 and
p = 0.05, and the right is that of SF-NET. The approximate formula of them are L = 2.5 loge n − 4.0236 and
L = 0.2421 loge n + 1.9031 or L = 2.1888 × n0.0707, respectively

Essentially L has same property as D. The reason will be that the number of steps needed up to a complete

estimation of D is nearly equal to that of L. This properties is invariant under changing Q in the NEN or k in

a random network. A regural lattice shows linear dependence in L − n relation such as D − n. Then NEN is

not so small world and so large world. Fig. 3 shows theoretical D − n curves of SW-NET[7] and SF-NET[8],[9]

that are given by

and their approximation curves. The approximation curves, which is useful for comparing to NEN or random

network phenomenologically, ﬁt too well to distinguish theoretical curves and approximation ones up to n =

1500. p is the renwiring possibility of links in SW-NET and p = 0.05 is taken in Fig.3. In SF-NET, both

of exponential and logarithmic functions ﬁt almost perfectly. Though it is possible that both of NEN and

SF-NET can be approximated by exponential functions, they are very diﬀerent from each other in index. Thus

NEN does not show so small world property. This property is invariant under changing Q value. As we increse

Q = 1, 5, 10, ..., the index decreses to s = 0.83, 0.62, 0.58, .... s = 0.07 in SF-NET is diﬀerent from those of

NEN in order (we should interpret that the small s means logarithmic function) and it seems not to be able

to overcome the diﬀerence. Thus SF-NET and NEN are essentially thought to be diﬀerent networks.

The clustering coeﬃent and the degree distribution have no signiﬁcance in dynamic networks, since the

network topology in NEN is apparently invariant temporally so that it takes the same value as the one of

regular lattice. As for this we may have to introduce a sort of new kind of index to investigate NEN in more

details.

We next study a propagation on this network, NEN. We set a virus on a node chosen at random. The

virus propagates on the network so that all nodes will get infected with the virus after some time steps S. Thus

we study the S that can more directly estimate connectibility of networks than D and L. They are shown in

Fig.4 where the propagation length is the number of steps untill all nodes are infected. This corresponds to

cases that is an infection rate I = 1 and a cure rate C = 0. A random network shows logarithmic behaviour

but nearly linear in NEN. (We can not distinguish between two approximate formula up to our computer

power. ) This also shows the crusial diﬀerence between a random network and NEN, they are are small world

network in a sense. We notice that the results are rather unstable. It depends on whether the virus ﬁrst put

is layed on exchange node or not. Notice that we insist on studying only topological and ststistical properties

of netoworks in this article, and more realistic studies of infections will be studied continuously.

4 Weighted Node Exchange Net; WNEN

There are some similarities between the NEN and SF-NET apparently, we pursue this point still more. Scale

free property appears from both of evolution and preferential attachment. We introduce the idea of the

preferential attachment into this dynamic NEN. We assume that the nodes which has been transferred once

are transferred with high propability after that. At m round and q times, the probability pi(t) that a node i

is chosen to be an exchange node at t is assumed that

pi(t) =

1+pi(t−1)N (t−1)
N (t−1)+2

pi(t − 1)

(

when the node i is chosen as exchange node at time t − 1 ,
others,

where

N (t) = n + 2t,

t = mQ + q,

pi(0) =

for all i.

This reﬂects the fact that while active people often transfer, others trend to stay. We call this type of

networks weighted Node Exchange Network (WNEN).

Figure 5: L for average of 100 times and S for average of 150 times in WENE with q = 10 and k = 4 : The left is
L that is approximately L = 0.6585n0.5784 and the right is S that is approximately S = 0.0725n+2.6983(black)
or S = 0.2819n0.7856(blue), respectively.

The results of computer simulation of L, D and a propagation of a virus on the network WNEN are just

similar to those of the NEN. They are partly given in Fig.5. This is because the number of times of exchange till

the evaluation of the above quantities is completed is not so large. For that reason, the preferential attachment

has not any drastic eﬀects in the simulation.

Thus we wish to prusue further characteristics of NEN or WNEN. We caluculate a sort of dynamic link

number distribution S(t). We, however, need to notice that the topology of the NEN is invariant at each time

step. The number of links connected with a node is same as the common degree of nodes every time. The

Si(t) at times t is the integration of nodes connected with the node i in the past. The nodes that connected

with the node i twice or more in the past is exempted from counting of Si(t). Thus Si(t) 6=

average of all Si(t) for all nodes;

S(t) =

n
i=1 Si(t)

.

P
We call this S(t) an integral link number ILN. We explore the distributions for S(t) and its time dependence.

These time dependences are given in Fig.6 where the horizontal axis means Si(m) and the vertical one means

the logarithmic number of vertices with Si(m). Just at m = 10, we can observe scale-free like behaviour. This

is a reason that the exponential behaviours are observed in L and so on at low m. As m grows larger, it

comes to break from the left to right, which show ”ant-scale free” behaviour, in Fig.6. The term ”anti-free”

introduced above means that many nodes enjoy a close intimacy with each other but a tiny minority do not

so, that is to say, dual to scal free. Thus following the WNEN temporally, we observe a series

t0 k. S(t) is the

regular → scalef ree → random → anti − scalef ree → regular.

Thus we observe a duality

Si(T − m) ↔ n − Si(T + m),

where T is nearly half time from initial time to the time that WNEN converges.

5 Concluding Remarks

By considering an eﬀect that people often transfer in real society, we propose a network where nodes exchange

each other dynamically. This network NEN where two nodes exhange the place constantly is a dynamic model

in the sense that analyses are carried out during the node exchange. This is a diﬀerent network from usual

non-dynamic networks including various types of evolving networks where analyses are usually carried out after

the enough growth. We evaluate diameters, averange path lengths between nodes and propagation lengths on

networks including NEN by computer simulation. We explore furthermore WNEN that reﬂects preferential

attachment in evolving network. As results of simulations it is proven that NEN and WNEN have the middle

properties between a random network and regular lattice model such as SW-NET. The essential prpperties,

however, is rather close to regular lattice model but clearly diﬀerent from SW-NET. Though partially NEN

also has the properties of scale free network, details should be more investigated from now on. The studies

of properties of WNEN at large t (middle or right cases in Fig.6) are also needed. Naturally various real

phenomena such as the propagation of pathogenic in more realistic setteng, robustness for fault, searching and

so on on NEN and WNEN should studied.

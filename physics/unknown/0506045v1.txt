1.  INTRODUCTION 

In  former  papers  [1,2]  we  have  shown  that  the  Schwarzschild  model  can  be 
embedded  in  a  flat  five-dimensional  space  by  the  use  of  two  correlated  surfaces, 
generated by the rotation of Schwarzschild(cid:146)s and Neil(cid:146)s parabola. This double surface can 
be  derived  from  a  single  surface  by  projection  techniques.  These  two  surfaces  have  a 
common  Riemann  and  Ricci  tensor.  If  we  cut  off  all  we  do  not  need  for  the  four-
dimensional description we obtain the physical surface. The physical surface is the place 
of  all possible  observations and  measurements. We are not  able  to  experience  the extra 
dimensions,  but  it  might  be  a  good  mathematical  method  to  use  a  higher-dimensional 
theory and embedding techniques to describe four-dimensional physics. In this paper we 
make  use  of  this  strategy.  We  analyze  the  Schwarzschild  metric  in  the  standard  and 
Kruskal forms and we make four assumptions: 

(i)  We interpret the Schwarzschild metric geometrically as the common metric of two 

correlated surfaces embedded in a five-dimensional flat space. 

(ii) 

Coordinate  transformations  are  arbitrary  and  a  matter  of  convenience.  They  do 
not alter the invariant geometrical structure of the theory. 

(iii)  We will use vectors as field strengths representing the normal and odd curvatures 

of these surfaces. 

transformations. 

(iv)  Any  transitions  to  new  states  of  motion  are  performed  by  local  Lorentz 

The  consequence  of  these  assumptions  is  that  the  Schwarzschild  model  will  not 

supply Black Hole physics and the Kruskal metric will not provide interior solutions.

Flamm’s  paraboloid  is  generated  by  rotating  the  Schwarzschild  parabola  about  the 
directrix  through  the  angles  ϑ   and  φ  .  Another  piece  of  the  four-dimensional  surface  is 
generated  by  an  imaginary  rotation  about  the  r-axis,  i.  e.,  the  symmetry  axis  of  the 
Schwarzschild  paraboloid.  Neil’s  paraboloid  is  generated  by  a  similar  procedure.  From

Replacing  ρdψ  in  (2.3)  with  the  Schwarzschild  co-ordinate  time  dt  we  obtain  the 
Schwarzschild metric in the standard notation. Since the Schwarzschild parabola has the 
vertex at r = 2M (ρ = 4M, ε = π/2) no geometry is defined for r < 2M. The Schwarzschild 
metric has a boundary at r = 2M as a consequence of assumption (i). The Schwarzschild 
metric is regular everywhere on the physical surface, also at r = 2M. From the equation  of 
the Schwarzschild parabola 

R being the co-ordinate of the extra dimension of the flat embedding space, we get instead 
of (2.5) 

(2.4) 

(2.5) 

(2.6) 

(2.7) 

which  shows  that  the  tangent  vector  of  the  physical  surface  at  the  boundary  of  the 
geometry is simply dR and is normal to the symmetry axis of the Schwarzschild parabola. 
The (cid:145)singularity(cid:146) at 2M can be removed by a suitable choice of the parameters. This was 
pointed out by Einstein and Rosen [3]. They defined a new variable, which differs from our 
R  by  the  factor  8M .  The  two  solutions  of  (2.6)  are  the  two  sheets  of  the  same  space, 
connected by the bridge at R = 0. The second sheet corresponds to the negative branch of 
the Schwarzschild parabola. Since the sign of the ascent of this branch is opposite to the 
sign of the ascent of the upper branch the velocity of a free object would be positive and 
the  action  of  the  central  mass  repulsive.  Since  antigravitation  is  not  known  to  occur  in 
nature we exclude the second branch from the theory.  The complete Schwarzschild model 
consists of the exterior and interior solution.  The latter has to be matched to the exterior 
solution  in  such  a  way  that  the  pressure  of  the  source  does  not  grow  infinitely  large  [4]. 
This  could  be  achieved  by  adjusting  the  aperture  angle  of  the  cap  of  sphere  which 

 

3 

represents  the  space-  like  part  of  the  physical  surface  in  a  convenient  manner.  The 
complete  solution  is  free  from  (cid:145)singularities(cid:146)    and  exhibits  no  peculiarities.  It  is  a  good 
model  for  approximately  describing  stellar  objects.  The  interior  solution  also  can  be 
embedded  in  a  five-dimensional  flat  space  [2].  It  turns  out  that  the  energy-momentum 
tensor  consists  of  the  generalized  second  fundamental  forms  of  the  embedded  surfaces 
and thus the matter can be interpreted as fields. The generalized Codazzi equations of the 
surfaces are the field equations for these matter fields.  

The  purist  geometrical  interpretation  of  the  Schwarzschild  metric  demands  that  no 
incoming  particle  can cross  the  boundary  of  the  geometry.  It  is  widely  accepted  that  any 
particle  incoming  from  infinity  approaches  the  speed  of  light  at  r  =  2M.  But  for  particles 
starting from a position different from infinity and falling to the center of gravitation several 
points  of  view  are  known  from  literature.  In most of  these  concepts  [5  -20]  the  radial  co-
ordinate  r  may  be  interpreted  as  the  path  the  observers  can  travel  on,  although  r  and  t 
interchange  their  meaning  for  r  <  2M.  There  was  a  discussion  if  particles  can  cross  the 
Schwarzschild radius with a velocity lower than the speed of light by Janis, Cavalleri and 
Spinelli  [12],  Tereno  [21]  and    Crawford  [22].  Mitra  [23-27]  showed  that  the  velocity  of  a 
particle  approaches  the  speed  of  light  at  r  =  2M  independently  of  the  position  it  was 
released  from.  This  view  is  supported  by  the  following  consideration:  A  particle  in-falling 
from  infinity  has  the  velocity 
  at  the  radial  position  r0.  Another  particle  is 
released from this position at the moment the first particle is passing. The difference of the 
velocity  of  these  particles  at  this  moment  is  v0.  Both  particles  are  exposed  to  the  same 
  on  their  travel  to  the  center  of  gravitation.    The

3.  THE KRUSKAL METRIC

believe    that  a  co-ordinate  transformation  changes  the  geometrical  content  of  the  theory 
we have to search for another explanation for the Kruskal metric. Evidently, the connexion

In agreement with assumption (iii) the Amn are the generalized second fundamental forms 
of  the  physical  surface.  A  co-ordinate  transformation  does  not  have  an  effect    on  this 
structure but a Lorentz transformation may be correlated to this co-ordinate transformation.

τ   is  the  unspecified  velocity  of  an  observer  in  radial  motion.  For  time 
where

reversion  χ → −χ   we  obtain  the  velocity  of  an  incoming  rocket 
analogous  composition  law.  For  sectors  II  and  IV  we  get  an  equivalent  relation  to  (3.13) 
with the velocities

(3.14) 

The  motion  is  tachyonic  [17].  The  rocket  is  at  rest  at  r  =  2M  with  infinite  speed  and  it 
accelerates to the speed of light in approaching infinity. For time reversion the rocket is at 
rest  with  the  speed  of  light  at  infinity.  On  its  way  to  the  center  of  gravitation  it  will  slow 
down to infinite speed. Fig. 2 is a diagram for both kinds of velocities (3.11) and (3.14).  

 

 

 

All these considerations refer to the tangent space of the exterior solution. Excluding 
the unphysical tachyonic sectors, Equs. (3.11) and (3.13) show that a Kruskal rocket is not 
able to cross the boundary of the geometry. The velocity of an incoming rocket tends to the 
speed of light in approaching r   = 2M.

4.  THE KRUSKAL ACCELERATION 

In the preceding chapter we have shown that the transition from the standard form of 
the Schwarzschild metric to the Kruskal form can be interpreted as Lorentz transformation 
with  non-constant  velocity  parameter  acting  in  the  tangent  space  of  the  Schwarzschild 
geometry.  This  results  in  an  accelerated  motion  of  observers.  In  the  following,  we  will 
derive  forces,  which  are  responsible  for  this  acceleration.  Firstly,  we  remark  that  the 
curvature properties of the geometry are invariant under the Lorentz transformation (3.10). 
In the new reference system the curvatures (3.6) get time-like components

These  equations  stand  for  the  prediction  that  an  accelerated  observer  makes  for  the 
physics  of  static  observers.  The  components  of  the  curvatures    are  expressed  in  the 
reference system of the accelerated observers. One should obtain the same Ricci tensor 
by an inhomogeneous transformation of the connexion coefficients

The  equations  for  the  gravitational  acceleration  and  the  Kruskal  acceleration  are 
expressed  in  a  similar  way,  but  one  has  to  bear  in  mind  that  the  Kruskal  acceleration  is 
due to a structure on the physical surface while the other equations describe the structure 
of the surface. 

5.  SUMMARY 

In  this  paper  we  have  shown  that  the  velocity  of  observers,  freely  falling  or  Kruskal 
accelerated to the center of gravitation, tends to the speed of light for r → 2M. No object is 
able  to  cross  the  event  horizon  of  the  Schwarzschild  geometry.  This  agrees  with  our 
assumptions  made  at  the  beginning  of  the  paper.  The  Schwarzschild  radius  fixes  the 
boundary  of  the  geometry.  For  r  <  2M  no  geometry  is  defined    by  the  exterior 
Schwarzschild  solution,  independently  of  the  co-ordinate  system  in  use.  Interpreting  the 
Schwarzschild metric strictly geometrically  no Black Hole physics can be derived from the 
Schwarzschild solution. 

I am indebted to Prof. H.-J. Treder for his kind  interest in this paper.

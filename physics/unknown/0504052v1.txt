Abstract:  We  show  that  nonlinear  phase  shifts  and  third-order  dispersion  can 
compensate each other in short-pulse fiber amplifiers.  In particular, we consider chirped-
pulse  fiber  amplifiers  at  wavelengths  for  which  the  fiber  dispersion  is  normal.  The 
nonlinear phase shift accumulated in the amplifier can be compensated by the third-order 
dispersion  of  the  combination  of  a  fiber  stretcher  and  grating  compressor.  A  numerical 
model is used to predict the compensation, and initial experimental results that exhibit the 
main features of the calculations are presented. In the presence of third-order dispersion, 
an optimal nonlinear phase shift reduces the pulse duration, and enhances the peak power 
and  pulse  contrast  compared  to  the  pulse  produced  in  linear  propagation.    Contrary  to 
common  belief,  fiber  stretchers  can  perform  as  well  or  better  than  grating  stretchers  in 
fiber amplifiers, while offering the major practical advantages of a waveguide medium.  
The  relative  benefits  of  a  fiber  stretcher  increase  with  increasing  pulse  energy,  so  the 
results presented here will be relevant to fiber amplifiers designed for the highest pulse 
energies.

1. Introduction 

It  is  well-known  that  nonlinear  phase  shifts  (ΦNL)  can  lead  to  distortion  of  short  optical  pulses  [1].    In 
chirped-pulse amplification (CPA) [2], a pulse is stretched to reduce the detrimental nonlinear effects that 
can occur  in  the gain  medium.    After  amplification,  the pulse  is  dechirped,  ideally  to  the  duration  of  the 
initial pulse. The stretching is typically accomplished by dispersively broadening the pulse in a segment of 
fiber or with a diffraction-grating pair.  For pulse energies of microjoules or greater, the dechirping is done 
with  gratings,  to  avoid  nonlinear  effects  in  the  presence  of  anomalous  group-velocity  dispersion  (GVD), 
which are particularly limiting. The magnitude of the dispersion of a grating stretcher can exactly equal that 
of the gratings used to dechirp the pulse, to all orders [3, 4].  At low energy, the process of stretching and 
compression can thus be perfect.  At higher energy, some nonlinear phase will be accumulated and this will 
degrade the temporal fidelity of the amplified pulse.  For many applications, ΦNL (also referred to as the B-
integral) must be less than 1 to avoid unacceptable structure on the amplified pulse [5, 6].  

The total dispersion of a fiber stretcher differs from that of a grating pair, and this mismatch results in 
uncompensated  third-order  dispersion  (TOD),  which  will  distort  and  broaden  the  pulse,  at  least  in  linear 
propagation.    At  wavelengths  where  the  fiber  has  normal  GVD  (such  as  1  µm,  which  will  be  our  main 
focus here), the TOD of the fiber adds to that of the grating pair.  Stretching ratios of thousands are used in 
CPA  systems  designed  to  generate  microjoule  and  millijoule-energy  pulses,  in  which  case  the  effects  of 
TOD would limit the dechirped pulse duration to the picosecond range.  It has thus become “conventional 
wisdom”  that  fiber  stretchers  are  unacceptable  in  CPA systems,  and  as  a  consequence,  grating  stretchers 
have become ubiquitous in these devices.   

Apart from the difficulty of compensating the cubic phase, a fiber offers major advantages as the pulse 
stretcher in a CPA system.  Coupling light into a fiber is trivial compared to aligning a grating stretcher.  
The  grating  stretcher  includes  an  imaging  system  [7]  that  can  be  misaligned,  and  when  misaligned  will 
produce  spatial  and  temporal  aberrations  in  the  stretching.    A  fiber  stretcher  cannot  be  misaligned.    The 
fiber is also less sensitive to drift or fluctuations in wavelength or the pointing of the beam that enters the 
stretcher.    Beam-pointing fluctuations  may  reduce  the  coupling  into  the fiber  to  below  the  optimal  level, 
whereas they translate into changes in dispersion with a grating pair.  Finally, the spatial properties of the 
beam  can  influence  the  stretching  with  a  grating  pair,  while  the  pulse  stretched  in  a  fiber  cannot  have 
spatial chirp, experiences the same stretching at all points on the beam, and exits the fiber with a perfect 
transverse  mode.    With  fiber  amplifiers,  there  is  naturally  strong  motivation  to  employ  fiber  stretchers  – 
grating stretchers detract substantially from the benefits of fiber.  

One  possible  solution  to  this  problem  is  the  combination  of  a  fiber  stretcher  with  a  grism  pair  for 
dechirping, as proposed by Kane and Squier [8]. However, grisms require a challenging synthesis and to 
date have not found significant use.  Recently, significant attention has been devoted to the development of 
fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs), including chirped FBGs, for use in CPA systems [9]. A chirped fiber grating 
designed to compensate higher-order dispersion is conceptually the same as a diffraction-grating stretcher, 
which is matched to the compressor to all orders, but it offers the practical advantages of fiber discussed 
above.    There  is  no  report  in  the  literature  of  a  fiber  grating  designed  to  compensate  nonlinearity.    The 
authors of Reference 9 point out that the output pulse is apparently distorted owing to the nonlinear phase 
shift at the highest energies.  It is an experimental fact that the fiber CPA systems that produce the highest 
pulse energies to date [10, 11] employ ordinary diffraction gratings, not chirped fiber gratings.    

Here  we  show  that  the  nonlinear  phase  shift  accumulated  by  a  pulse  in  amplification  can  actually  be 
compensated to some degree by the cubic spectral phase. (Or vice-versa -- the cubic spectral phase can be 
compensated  by  nonlinearity.)    This  conclusion  has  important  consequences  for  short-pulse  fiber 
amplifiers. First, the performance of a CPA system with a fiber stretcher and grating compressor actually 
improves with nonlinearity. This behavior contrasts with that of a CPA system with grating stretcher and 
compressor, where the pulse fidelity decreases monotonically with nonlinear phase shift. Second, near the 
optimal value of the nonlinear phase, a fiber stretcher can perform better than a grating stretcher.  This 
compensation of TOD by nonlinear phase shift will not offer much advantage in solid-state amplifiers, in 
which  the  spatial  consequences  of  the  nonlinear  phase  shift  will  be  limiting:  small-scale  or  whole-beam 
self-focusing will distort the beam or, eventually, damage the gain medium.  Most of the effort to develop 
CPA  systems  has  involved  bulk  solid-state  gain  media,  as  opposed  to  fibers.    This  may  explain  why  the 
process described here has not been pointed out previously.  In a single-mode fiber, there are no transverse 
variations, so the longitudinal effects of the nonlinear phase can be isolated and exploited.  In this report we 
focus on ordinary single-mode fiber, but the approach can be used in any implementation of CPA, such as 
those employing fiber Bragg gratings or photonic bandgap fibers. 

2. Principle and numerical modeling 

 
It  is  perhaps  remarkable  that  nonlinear  phase  shifts  and  TOD  should  compensate  each  other.    After  all, 
TOD  acting  alone  produces  an  anti-symmetric  phase,  while  self-phase  modulation  alone  produces  a 
symmetric  phase.    We  can  offer  a  qualitative  rationale  for  the  compensation  by  considering  pulse 
propagation in a fiber stretcher, followed by a nonlinear segment with negligible dispersion, and a grating 
compressor.  After stretching, the pulse develops a slightly asymmetric intensity profile owing to the TOD.  
However, because GVD dominates the stretching, the mean time in the pulse remains close to zero.  That 
is, the pulse energy does not shift in time.  This implies that the peak of the pulse moves to slightly earlier 
(negative) time, while the asymmetric tail associated with TOD extends to later time, for d3φ/dω3 > 0.  The 
nonlinear phase shift accumulated by the stretched pulse is then also peaked at slightly negative time, and 
the  temporal  phase  has  negative  slope  at  the  center  of  the  pulse.  In  the  compressor,  the  large  quadratic 
phase from GVD is subtracted off, while the positive TOD counters the negative phase slope.  Analogous 
arguments can be made in the frequency domain, because time is approximately  mapped to frequency in 
highly-chirped pulses.  This intuitive explanation is consistent with the numerical results presented below, 
but more work is needed to understand this process thoroughly.   

Numerical  simulations  were  employed  to  study  CPA  with  a  fiber  stretcher,  a  fiber  amplifier  and  a 
grating  compressor  (the  key  elements  of  the  experimental  setup  in  Fig.  3).    The  parameters  of  the 
simulations  were  taken  as  those  of  the  experiments  described  below,  to  allow  comparison  of  theory  and 
experiment.  All the fiber is single-mode fiber (SMF).  The input pulses to this system represent the output 
of an Yb fiber oscillator [12, 13] and were taken to be 150-fs gaussian pulses with 10.4-nm bandwidth at 
1060  nm.  The  stretcher  consists  of  100  m  of  SMF,  and  analogous  results  for  a  400-m  stretcher  will  be 
summarized below. The amplifier consists of 1 m of Yb-doped gain fiber, and is followed by 3 m of SMF, 
where  most  of  the  nonlinear  phase  shift  is  accumulated.    The  magnitude  of  the  nonlinear  phase  shift  is 
adjusted by varying the gain of the amplifier.  The compressor is a pair of gratings with 1200 lines/mm, 
used in a double-pass configuration.  The GVD and TOD of the fibers and grating pairs are included in the 
simulations (the numerical values are listed in the caption of Fig. 1).  The nonlinear Schrödinger equations 
that govern propagation in each section are solved by the standard split-step technique.  

After propagation through 100 m of stretcher fiber, the pulse duration is 46 ps.  The compressor grating 
separation is optimized to produce the shortest output pulse at each pulse energy; as expected, the grating 
separation decreases with increasing ΦNL. All numerical and experimental results reported here are based 
on the optimal grating separations. 

As an approximation to linear propagation, the amplifier gain was adjusted to produce a low-energy (4 
nJ) pulse.  The resulting ΦNL = 0.4π.  The pulse shape after compression (Fig. 1(a)) exhibits the signature 
asymmetric  broadening  and  secondary  structure  from  TOD.    The  full-width  at  half-maximum  (FWHM) 
pulse duration has increased to 290 fs, and the peak power is 9.5 kW.  The envelopes of the interferometric 
autocorrelation of the output pulse are shown in Fig. 1(b).  The autocorrelations are provided because they 
will be compared to experimental results below. 

Increasing the nonlinear phase shift improves the quality of the output pulse. Best results are obtained 
with  amplified  pulse  energy  of  19  nJ,  which  produces ΦNL ≈  1.9π.    With  this  nonlinear  phase  shift,  the 
compressed  pulse  (Fig.  1(c))  duration  is  reduced  to  191  fs,  which  is  within  ~25%  of  the  original  pulse 
width. Equally significant is the suppression of the trailing “wing” of the pulse.  The resulting peak power 
is 74 kW; the pulse energy is 5 times larger than in Fig. 1(a), but the peak power is 8 times larger owing to 
the improved pulse quality.  The corresponding autocorrelation is shown in Fig. 1(d). The power spectrum 
broadens  by  less  than  5%  at  the  highest  energy.    Spectral  broadening  is  roughly  proportional  to  the 
nonlinear phase shift divided by the stretching ratio, so small broadening is expected for ΦNL ~ 2π and a 
stretching  ratio  of 300.  For  larger  nonlinear  phase  shifts,  the  pulse  quality  degrades.    Thus,  for  a  given 
amount of cubic phase, there is an optimal value of ΦNL.  Simulations with the signs of the TOD of the fiber 
and grating pair reversed produce identical results; a positive (self-focusing) nonlinearity can compensate 
the effects of either sign of TOD. 

For comparison, we show the best results that can be obtained with a grating stretcher and compressor 
at  the  same  value  of ΦNL  (i.e.,  the  same  pulse  energy).    The  compressed  pulse  (Fig.  1(e))  has  FWHM 
duration  214  fs  and  peak  power  67  kW.  Thus,  for  this  low  stretching  ratio  and  pulse  energy,  the  fiber 
stretcher offers ~10% improvement over the grating stretcher.  However, we emphasize that the advantage 
of the fiber stretcher increases with increased stretching ratio and nonlinear phase shift.

The results of a series of similar calculations with varying nonlinear phase shift are summarized in Fig. 
2(a). We define the relative peak power as the ratio of the peak power of the output pulse to the ideal peak 
power  that  would  be  obtained  in  the  absence  of  TOD  and  nonlinear  phase  shift.  That  is,  the  ideal  peak 
power is that of the output pulse energy with the input pulse intensity profile.   With a grating stretcher, the 
relative  peak power  decreases  monotonically  with ΦNL.    This  trend  is  well-known  and  is  the  reason why 
ΦNL is typically limited to 1 in CPA systems.  The relative peak power with a fiber stretcher increases until 
ΦNL ~ 2π, and then decreases.  For ΦNL > 1.5π the fiber stretcher performs better than the grating stretcher, 
albeit by a small margin.  The inset shows the variation of the FWHM pulse duration with ΦNL.

symbols) stretchers.  The pulse is stretched to ~46 ps in each case.  The inset shows the variation of the pulse 
duration with ΦNL.  b) Same as a) but with 400-m stretcher, which stretches to ~140 ps.  The lines are only to 
guide the eye. 

 
Analogous results for a 400-m stretcher are shown in Fig. 2(b) and, together with Fig. 2(a), illustrate the 
scaling of the compensation.  The optimal value of ΦNL increases roughly linearly with the magnitude of 
the TOD.  The benefit of nonlinearity is larger with greater TOD:  with a 100-m stretcher the relative peak 
power is ~50% larger than that obtained in linear propagation (ΦNL = 0), while with a 400-m stretcher the 
relative peak power increases by nearly a factor of two.  The advantage of a fiber stretcher over a grating 
stretcher at the optimal value of ΦNL also increases with increasing TOD.  On the other hand, the maximum 
value of the relative peak power decreases with increasing TOD.   With a 400-m stretcher, a 500-nJ pulse 
produces ΦNL = 5.4π.  The compressed pulse duration is 300 fs (compared to ~500 fs with ΦNL = 0, or 380 
fs with TOD = 0), and with 60% compressor efficiency a peak power of 1 MW is reached.  If the TOD is 
doubled while all other parameters are held constant, the pulse energy reaches 1 µJ, with ΦNL = 10.8π.  The 
compressed pulse duration is still 300 fs, and the peak power reaches ~2 MW. 

 

3. Experimental results  

 
A schematic of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 3. The Yb fiber laser generates 140-fs pulses with 
~12 nm  bandwidth  at  1060 nm.    The parameters  of  the experiment  are  dictated by  the  fact  that we were 
limited to 400-mW pump power in our laboratory, which impacts the range of nonlinear phase shifts that 
can be reached conveniently in a controlled experiment.  The pulse is stretched in 100 m of fiber. After a 
preamplifier stage, the repetition rate can be cut from 40 MHz to 3 MHz with an acousto-optic modulator 
(AOM).    The  amplified  and  compressed  pulses  are  characterized  with  an  interferometric  autocorrelator.  
Fig. 1 shows that the autocorrelation obscures the dramatic variation in the pulse shape and asymmetry as 
ΦNL  is  varied.    However,  the  variation  in  the  pulse  duration  is  readily  observable.  More-detailed 
information  will  be  obtained  by  recording  the  cross-correlation  of  the  compressed  pulse  with  the  input 
pulse, or by recording the intensity and phase with frequency-resolved optical gating [14], e.g., and these 
will be the subject of future work.  

The variation of the output pulse with ΦNL is shown in Fig. 4.  The lowest pulse energy was limited by 
the desire to record the autocorrelation with adequate signal-to-noise ratio.  With the AOM turned off, the 
pulse  energy  was  3  nJ,  which  produced ΦNL  =  0.4π.    (The ΦNL  obtained  with  a  given  pulse  energy  is 
slightly larger than that of the simulations, which neglect ~2 m of SMF that couple light into and out of the 
AOM.)  The autocorrelation (Fig. 4(a)) implies a pulse duration of 240 fs.  A similar result is obtained with 
lower signal-to-noise ratio when the AOM is turned on to reduce the repetition rate. At 3 MHz, the pulse is 
amplified to 15 nJ, and ΦNL = 1.8π. The pulse duration (Fig. 4(b)) decreases to 180 fs, and the secondary 
structure  that  arises  from  TOD  diminishes.    When  the  pulse  energy  increases  to  17  nJ  (ΦNL=2.1π  ),  the 
pulse  duration  increases  again  to  195  fs  and  the  secondary  structure  begins  to  increase  as  well.  The 
experimental  trend  agrees  qualitatively  and  semi-quantitatively  with  the  numerical  simulations,  and 

exhibits a clear minimum in the pulse duration near the expected optimum value of ΦNL. As expected, the 
power spectrum broadens slightly at the highest pulse energies.

4. Discussion and conclusion 

The demonstration that TOD and nonlinear phase shifts can compensate each other seems likely to change 
the way future short-pulse fiber amplifiers are designed. The agreement between the experimental results 
and the numerical simulations allows us to extrapolate to higher pulse energies than employed here.  There 
is  great  interest  in  construction  of  fiber  amplifiers  for  microjoule  and  even  millijoule-energy  pulses,  but 
nonlinearity  presents  a  major  challenge  in  the  design  of  such  devices.    In  the  approach  presented  here, 
nonlinearity  is  desirable.    Amplifiers  can  be  designed  to  operate  with  a  certain  nonlinear  phase  shift, 
instead  of  attempting  to  avoid  nonlinearity  entirely.  The  stretcher  and  compressor  can  be  designed  to 
operate  with  a  certain  TOD,  instead  of  attempting  to  minimize  it.  Our  initial  calculations  indicate  that 
microjoule-energy  pulses  of  ~300-fs  duration  can  be  obtained  from  amplifiers  that  use  only  SMF,  and 
millijoule-level  pulses  may  be  obtained  with  multimode  fiber  [11]  or  large-mode-area  photonic-crystal 
fiber [10].  Scaling to shorter pulses is also possible. The overwhelming practical benefits of fiber stretchers 
would  recommend  their  use  if  the  resulting  performance  was  equal  to,  or  even  slightly  worse  than,  that 
obtained  with  a  grating  stretcher.    With  the  possibility  of  better  performance,  fiber  stretchers  should 
become  the  standard  in  short-pulse  fiber  amplifiers.    The  compensation  of  nonlinearity  by  TOD  can  be 
implemented  in  various  ways.    Fiber  Bragg  gratings  offer  an  appealing  combination  of  compactness  and 
dispersion control and efforts exist to demonstrate customized chirping of the grating period to compensate 
higher orders of dispersion.  Disadvantages of FBGs include an inherent tradeoff between bandwidth and 
dispersion, the requirement of expensive (often custom) fabrications, and limited adjustability in dispersion 

for a given design.  These properties contrast with the simplicity and availability of SMF. Of course, the 
compensation of nonlinearity by TOD described here can be implemented with FBGs: the FBG would be 
designed to provide a certain amount of TOD, depending on the desired pulse energy.  Similar arguments 
can be made for dechirping the pulse with photonic-bandgap fiber.   

To summarize, we have demonstrated that nonlinearity and TOD can compensate each other to a large 
degree in CPA systems.   For a given magnitude of TOD, there exists an optimum value of the nonlinear 
phase shift, for which the output pulse duration is minimized.  The output pulse can be significantly shorter 
and cleaner than in the absence of nonlinearity, and the peak power is correspondingly increased.  Initial 
experiments with low-energy (~20 nJ) femtosecond pulses clearly exhibit the main features and trends of 
the  theoretical  predictions.    Extension  of  this  approach  to  higher  pulse  energies  appears  to  be 
straightforward.  Significantly,  the  benefits  of  this  approach  increase  with  nonlinear  phase  shift,  i.e.,  with 
pulse  energy.  Compensation  of  dispersion  beyond  third-order  by  nonlinear  phase  shifts  may  also  be 
expected.  Finally,  the  concept  described  here  can  be  combined  with  other  devices  such  as  fiber  Bragg 
gratings or photonic-bandgap fibers.  We expect this technique to find significant use in future high-energy 
short-pulse fiber amplifiers.

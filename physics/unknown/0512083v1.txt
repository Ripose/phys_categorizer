We consider the lateral shift of a light beam reflecting from a dielectric slab backed by 

a  metal.  It  is  found  that  the  lateral  shift  of  the  reflected  beam  can  be  negative  while  the 

intensity of reflected beam is almost equal to the incident one under a certain condition. The 

explanation for the negativity of the lateral shift is given in terms of the interference of the 

reflected  waves  from  the  two  interfaces.  It  is  also  shown  that  the  lateral  shift  can  be 

enhanced  or  suppressed  under  some  other  conditions.  The  numerical  calculation  on  the 

lateral shift for a realistic Gaussian-shaped beam confirms our theoretical prediction. ©2005

It is well known that the Goos-Hänchen (GH) effect [1-2] refers to the lateral shift  ∆  

of a totally reflected beam displaced from the path of geometrical optics. This phenomenon 

has  been  widely  analyzed  both  theoretically  [3-9]  and  experimentally  [1,  10-14].  The 

investigation on the GH shift has been extended to other areas of physics, such as acoustics, 

quantum  mechanics  and  plasma  physics  [15].  The  GH  shift  is  usually  proportional  to  the 

penetration  depth  at  the  order  of  a  wavelength.  Many  attempts  have  been  made  to  achieve 

large  lateral  shifts  (positive  or  negative)  under  different  circumstances,  such  as  absorbing 

media [4, 9], atomic resonant absorptive vapors [12, 16], resonant artificial structures [7, 17-

18], negative-permittivity media [19-20], negatively refractive media [21-28], dielectric slabs 

[8, 29-30], multi-layered structures [6, 31-32]. Recently Li [8] found that the lateral shift of a 

light  beam  passing  through  a  lossless  transmitting  slab  could  be  negative  due  to  the 

interference between the reflected waves from the slab’s two interfaces. However, in Ref. 8, 

the  amplitude  of  the  reflected  beam  is  strongly  dependent on the parameters  of  the slab. In 

this  paper,  we  consider  a  light  beam  reflecting  from  a  dielectric  slab  backed  by  a  metal, 

where the lateral shift of the reflected beam can also be negative with the advantage that the 

reflected beam intensity is almost equal to the incident one at any incident angles (this makes 

the comparison of the measured lateral shifts easy). When the thickness of the dielectric slab 

is  suitable  chosen,  the  negative  lateral  shift  is  dominated.  The  physics  behind  the  negative 

lateral shift is the interference between the two reflected waves from two interfaces. At the 

same time, the lateral shift can also be positive, and it is shown that the lateral shift can be 

greatly enhanced or suppressed under certain conditions. Finally, we present a simulation for 

the lateral shift of a Gaussian-shaped beam. 

Consider  a  TE-polarized  light  beam  of  angular  frequency  ω (corresponding 

wavelength λ )  with  angle  θ  incident  from  the  vacuum  (

1ε = )  upon  a  nonmagnetic 

0

dielectric slab backed by a metal ( 2ε ). The slab’s thickness is  d  and its dielectric constant is

For  the  wide  incident  beam  (i.e.,  with  a  very  narrow  angular  spectrum,

This  is  our  key  result  of  the  present  problem.  For  the  optical  denser  medium  ( 1 1ε > ),  the

holds,  the  lateral  shift  ∆  becomes  negative,  i.e.,  the  reflected  beam  will  be  appeared  at  the 

left  side  of  the  dotted  line  as  shown  in  Fig.  1  (Ray  1).  This  result  is  counterintuitive  in 

comparison  with  the  prediction  of  geometric  optics.  In  the  frame  of  geometric  optics,  the 

lateral shift of the reflected wave from the first interface is zero and that of the reflected wave 

from  the  second  interface  is

'θ  is  determined  by  Snell’s  law  of

),  see  the  dotted  and  dashed  lines  in  Fig.  1.  The  inequality  (5) 

indicates  that  the  negative  lateral  shifts  are  much  easily  obtained  at  the  large  angles  of 

incidence θ (or for the large value 1ε ). 

Figure 2 shows the dependence of  ∆ on the thickness d , where  1

 (solid line) and 

ε =

 (dashed line) at wavelengthλ, and the incident angle is

In  this  case,  the  first  term  is  always  positive  and  is  proportional  to  the  thickness  d  by 

companying  a  periodical  factor

 with  respect  to

leads  the  lateral  shift  to  be  negative  due  to  the  periodical  function, 

sin[

.  The  second 

term origins from the interference between two reflected waves from the two interfaces of the 

dielectric  slab.  The  interference  leads  to  the  oscillation  of  the  lateral  shift  [8].  However,  in 

our case, the value of 

r θ  is always equal to one, so that there is no angular shift even for 
( )

the  finite  beam  (which  refers  to  the  departure  from  the  original  propagation  direction)  that 

could not be avoided in Refs. [8, 29]. To average the first and second terms over

Actually, under the condition of 

<<dk z

, the lateral shift is dominated by the 

second  term  in  Eq.  (6),  and  consequently  the  negative  lateral  shift  can  be  observed  much 

easier [see Fig. 3 (a)]. Conversely, when 

>>dk z

 is satisfied, the lateral shift will be 

dominated by the first term [see Fig. 3(b)], and consequently,  ∆  can be further approximated

The physical origin of the enhancement (or suppression) of the lateral shift comes from the 

destructive  interference  (or  the  constructive  interference)  of  the  reflected  wave  at  the  first 

interface with the incident wave. 

In practice, the plane wave assumed above is an approximation. Normally the front of an 

incident wave is finite, that is to say, it has a profile with a certain width, typically a Gaussian 

profile.  Therefore, we consider the lateral shift of the finite beam, such as a Gaussian-shaped 

beam, incident upon the system, for example, a glass layer backed by silver. The electric field 

of the incident beam at the plane of

In the numerical simulations using Eqs. (7,8), we take

λ=

(

 is sharply distributed around 

0xk ), and consequently, it is expected that 

the  shape  of  the  reflected  beam  is  the  same  as  that  of  the  incident  beam  without  obvious 

distortion. We use the peak position difference between the incident and reflected beams to 

denote the lateral shift  ∆ , see the black dots in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, we also plot the result from 

Eq. (4) by the thin lines. It is clear that our simulation result is in good agreement with our 

analytical result. From Fig. 4(a), with slab thickness  λ=d

, the lateral shift can be negative at 

large  angle  [also  see  the  inset  of  Fig.  4(b)].  In  addition,  for  slab  thickness, 

λ6=d

,  ∆  can 

enhanced or suppressed at certain angles, which can be see in  Fig. 4(b) by comparing with 

∆  (the thick line).  

In conclusion, the GH shift of a light beam, reflecting from a dielectric slab backed by a 

metal,  is  theoretically  investigated.  The  analytic  expression  for  the  lateral  shift  by  the 

stationary-phase  method  is  obtained,  and  the  numerical  simulations  confirm  the  analytical 

predictions. It is found that the lateral shift of the reflected beam can be negative as well as 

positive. The negative lateral shift is due to the interference of the reflected waves from the 

dielectric-air  and  dielectric-metal  interfaces.  This  is  a  counterintuitive  phenomenon  in 

comparison  with  the  prediction  of  geometrical  optics.  Meanwhile,  the  positive  lateral  shift 

can  be  enhanced  or  suppressed  under  certain  conditions.  It  should  be  pointed  out  that, 

 

6

because  the  modulus  of  the  reflection  coefficient  is  equal  to  one,  the  angular  shift  is  never 

appeared in our case and the shape of the reflected beam is nearly without distortion in our 

simulation.

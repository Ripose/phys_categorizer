    In the spirit of continued study of plasma wave general properties we investigated the 
boundary problem with the simplest form of electric field pulse 
0=x
 of half-infinite uniform plasma slab. In the case of longitudinal electric field pulse 
its traveling velocity is essentially other than in the case of harmonic waves; there is also  
no back response. In the case of transverse field pulse there takes place the bimodal  
propagation rate of the fast pulse signal with  amplitude 
pulse signals; some very weak response (“echo”) arises with a time delay of the  order 

0E  and weak slow sign reversed

    In the preceding papers (see [1] and references therein) we have considered some general features  
of 1D electron waves in a half-infinite homogeneous plasma slab which are excited by harmonic 
electric field at a boundary plane of the slab. These investigations were based on a simple and appearing 
rather evident principle: indefinitely divergent integrals (IDI) emerging in the dispersion equations are a 
direct consequence of the information lack in original wave equations (kinetic and Maxwell equations). 
Thus method of calculation for IDI has to be defined neither arbitrarily nor from ubiquitous 
mathematical analogies, but strongly follows from some additional physical conditions of the problem 
resulting in its single solution. It is significant here that all diverse asymptotical solutions obtained with 
the Laplace transform method are satisfying original wave equations independently on understanding 
(on implied sense) of the IDI. 
    For the boundary problem with waves excited by harmonic electrical field such physical conditions 
are both impossibility of kinematical waves which would not be bound with the boundary electric field,  
and absence of backward  traveling waves, at least for the fast wave mode, since in the homogeneous 
plasma slab there are no sources of exciting them. It is shown that these complementary conditions are 
satisfied for IDI in the principal value sense (Vlasov) but are not satisfied with IDI in the contour 
xv (Landau). It ought 
integral sense with passing around poles in the complex plane of integration in 
also to note that these additional requirements define the missing boundary condition for the electron 
distribution function in the only way. 
    Before used Laplace transform method for obtaining asymptotical solution can now be used with 
some reservation also in the case of pulse boundary field. Since we are interested in the most general   
exp
in principle difference of the pulse and harmonic excitations, we have selected 
simple illustrative boundary pulse excitation field with its simplest Laplace transform

    In the round brackets of Eq. (7) it ought to select the sign minus which corresponds to a forward

discussed in preceding papers [1], [4] and was explained presumably by forming some suited boundary

. It is thus a characteristic time of setting asymptotical solution. 

 
 It appears to be sound an assumption that pulse formation is lasting within the characteristic boundary  
 excitation time 
 In this case there are no reasons to expect appearance of a back signal of the longitudinal field pulse 
 (“echo”). This problem can be solved both experimentally and theoretically, for example with 
numerical  solution of the coupled original equations at boundary conditions for the field and 
distribution function.  These conditions have to be found before from Laplace transform with additional 
asymptotic conditions of absence the back pulse and absence of  kinematical modes which would not  
bound with the given  boundary electric field.

In this way amplitudes of the forward and the backward slow pulses are much smaller than amplitude  
of the rapid forward pulse, and both foregoing ones have reversed sign relative to the rapid pulse. 
    Emerging of returning signal is perceived as a reflection of the forward slow mode pulse of the 
solution, however it appears more sound to take this effect as a result of the polarization charge 
redistribution in the near zone of forming asymptotic solution for the rapid pulse, such that the rapid 
backward pulse would be prevented.  
    It ought to note that the presented considerations confirm the possibility to satisfy additional 
boundary conditions and to determine the form of distribution function and 
just at the IDI taken in the principal value sense. 
 
                                                                  Conclusion 
    We have considered propagation of pulses in a half-infinite slab of homogeneous Maxwellian 
electron plasma which were excited by longitudinal or transverse boundary pulses of electric field, 
using some rather simplified illustration of Laplace transform method. It ought to note the sign 
reversing of the traverse slow mode amplitude relative to the rapid one and significant dependence of 
the pulse velocity on its form.  
     We used a sound assumption that setting of the asymptotical solution is occurring at the early stage  
in the near boundary polarization zone within the rapid pulse length where some polarization charge 
redistribution occurs. In this case, for the pulse excited by longitudinal boundary field the backward 
pulse does not arise. Its arising (“echo”) is possible only in the case of transversal exciting field at the

 bimodal solution. The rapid pulse goes ahead, it is followed with some lag by the slow pulse. In the 
 near boundary zone of forming  the rapid pulse  the backward slow pulse is also forming with a  
 response time lag, the last one is defined with the length of the rapid pulse and the backward slow  
 pulse velocity.  
      It is significant that this considered although simple however specific case of electric signal back 
 response is related to neither additional non-linear terms in original linear equations,  nor Landau  
 damping and resonance electron beams, and it does not pretend to any generalization of a huge 
 variety of echo phenomena in very divers methods of supporting and influence upon plasmas (see, 
 for example, [6] ).

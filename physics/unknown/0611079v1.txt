Abstract 

In this contribution we discuss how to prepare some possible detectors – only 
silicon  option  being  considered,  for  the  new  era  of  HEP  challenges  because 
the  bulk  displacement  damage  in  the  detector,  consequence  of  irradiation, 
produces  effects  at  the  device  level  that  limit  their  long  time  utilisation, 
increasing  the  leakage  current  and  the  depletion  potential,  eventually  up  to 
breakdown,  and  thus  affecting  the  lifetime  of  detector  systems.  Physical 
phenomena that conduce to the degradation of the detector are analysed both 
at the material and device levels, and some predictions of the time degradation 
of  silicon  detectors  in  the  radiation  environments  expected  in  the  LHC 
machine  upgrade  in  luminosity  and  energy  as  SLHC  or  VLHC,  or  at  ULHC 
are  given.  Possible  effects  at  the  detector  level  after  high  energy  cosmic 
proton  bombardment  are  investigated  as  well.  Time  dependences  of  these 
device parameters are studied in conditions of continuous irradiation and the 
technological  options  for  detector  materials  are  discussed,  to  obtain  devices 
harder to radiation. 
 
 
 
 
 

1. Introduction: the Future Ultra High Proton Facilities 

Particle  physics  has  made  striking  advances  in  the  last  fifty  years  in  describing  the  intimate 
structure  of  matter  and  the  forces  that  determine  the  architecture  of  the  universe.  Major  steps 
towards  answering  the  open  questions  would  come  from  developing  global  theories  but  invoke 
                                                 
& Work in the frame of the CERN RD-50 Collaboration 
∗ This work has partially been supported by the Romanian Scientific National Programmes CERES and MATNANTECH, under 
contracts C4-69/2004 and 219 (404) /2004 respectively. 

energy scales that are far beyond the reach of conceivable accelerators and from obtaining new 
experimental results at higher energies, or at least observable traces of these theories at accessible 
energies. Experiments relevant to this quest are not restricted to the highest energy frontier; they 
are also possible at low energy scales. A discussion of the search for new physics at the future 
collider facilities is given in Ref. [1]. 

The  LHC  at  CERN  will  be  operational  from  2007.  But  the  physics  results  expected  from  this 
facility  will  not  be  able  to  clarify  all  the  unknowns  of  the  Standard  Model.  So,  despite  the 
technological  difficulty,  significant  upgrades  of  the  accelerator  in  energy  and  luminosity  are 
considered  as  SLHC  and  VLHC  respectively.  The  upgrade  path  will  be  defined  by  the  results 
from the initial years of LHC operation, and now only possible scenarios can be done up to 240 
TeV,  the  final  energy  of  the  project.  Ultimate  Large  Hadron  Collider  (ULHC)  is  imagined  as 
accelerating  protons  to  energies  above  107  TeV  in  a  ring  with  a  circumference  L≈4×104  km 
around Earth and such a facility will permit to ex-plore the “intermediate” energy scale, about 107 
TeV,  between  the  electroweek  scale  (1  TeV)  and  the  scale  of  grand  unification  (around  1014 
TeV).

Other possibility to have access to ultra high energy particles, complementary to colliders 
is  the  exploitation  of  the  astroparticles  or  cosmic  rays  (CR).  Protons  are  the  most 
abundant  charged  particles  in  space  and  in  this  contribution  aspects  of  the  CR  primary 
proton  spectrum  are  discussed,  in  the  kinetic  energy  range  0.2  ÷  200  GeV,  in  the 
neighbourhood  of  Earth,  as  have  been  measured  by  the  Alpha  Magnetic  Spectrometer 
during space shuttle flight STS-91. The energy range between 105÷108 TeV of the CR is 
closed  by  the  expected  energy  of  protons  at  ULHC,  but  the  flux  is  irrelevant  for 
degradation effects in detectors to be considered. 

In  this  work  we  discuss  how  to  prepare  some  possible  detectors  –  only  silicon  option 
being considered, for the new era of HEP challenges, because bulk displacement damage 
in the detector, consequence of irradiation, produces effects at the device level that limit 
their long time utilisation, increasing the leakage current and the depletion voltage up to 
breakdown, and thus affects the lifetime of detector systems. 

The  main  parameters  of  LHC  and  of  future  colliders,  relevant  for  the  present 
investigation, are presented in Table 1. For ULHC, estimates of some physical quantities 
are based on the linear extrapolation of known results, but surprises are not excluded at 
ultra high energies.  
 
 
 
2. Interactions of Particles in the Detector and the of Kinetics of Defects 

The nuclear interaction between the incident particle and the lattice nuclei produces bulk 
defects:  the  recoil  nucleus(i)  produced  in  the  interaction  are  dis-placed  from  lattice 
positions into interstitials, their initial positions being vacant. Then, the primary knock-on 
nucleus, if its energy is large enough, could produce new displacements and the process 
continues as long as the ener-gy of the colliding nucleus is higher than the threshold for 
atomic  displa-cements.  The  physical  quantity  characterising  the  process  is  the 
concentration of primary defects produced per unit of fluence of incident particles (CPD).  

The  values  of  CPD  corresponding  to  the  expected  <ET>  energies  for  the  spectra  after 
primary interactions at future colliders are in the vicinity of the asymptotic high energy 
limit, where:

CPD is not proportional to the modifications of material parameters after irradiation, due 
to  the  subsequent  interactions  of  vacancies  and  interstitials  and  with  other  defects  and 
impurities  (only  phosphorus,  carbon  and  oxygen  are  considered  as  pre-existent)  in  the 
lattice.  

The formation and time evolution of complex defects, associations of primary defects or 
of primary defects and impurities are studied in accord with the model developed by the 
authors; see for example [2] and previously author’s papers cited therein. 

The  primary  point  defects  considered  here  are  silicon  self  interstitials  and  vacancies: 
“classic”  vacancies  and  fourfold  coordinated  defects  -  SiFFCD;  new  defect  predicted  by 
Goedecker  and  co-workers  [3].  The  characteristics  of  the  SiFFCD  defect  have  been

a  sum  of  contributions  from  thermal  generation  and  irradiation.  The  integral  irradiation 
rate  is  a  convolution  between  CPD  and  the  flux  of  particles.  In  the  irradiation  rate,  the 
information about the identity and characteristics of primary particles that produce degra-
dation is lost. The phenomena occurring in the material after primary defect production 
are considered in the frame of the theory of diffusion limited reactions. The complete list 
of  reactions  considered  was  done  in  Ref.  [4].  The  model  predicts  absolute  values  for 
microscopic  quantities  –  concentrations  of  defects  and  the  characteristics  of  the  device,

[4]. 
 
 
 
3. Predictions of the Behaviour of Detectors  

The experimental results and model calculation for step by step irradiation at high rates of 
generation  of  defects,  up  to  fluences  expected  at  new  colliders,  indicate  a  very  good 
agreement see [5], but the degradation is not clearly correlated with oxygen concentration 
in  silicon  or  with  the  resistivity  of  the  starting  material.  Consequently,  for  these 
experimental  conditions,  it  is  not  possible  to  make  a  choice  between  FZ  and  DOFZ 
materials. In Figs. 1 and 2, the time dependence of the leakage current and of effective 
carrier  concentration  of  for  FZ  and  DOFZ  materials,  in  conditions  of  continuous 
irradiation at rates between those corresponding to cosmic protons up to new colliders are 
presented. The rates of generation of defects are about 200 pairs/cm3 for cosmic particles, 
about 7×108 pairs/cm3 for LHC, and roughly10 times higher for SLHC and VLHC.

Figure 1.  
Time dependence of the volume density of the leakage current for FZ and DOFZ silicon. 

For  leakage  current,  an  approximately  linear  dependence  of  time  is  obtained  in  log-log 
scale,  FZ  materials  presenting  a  lower  slope  in  comparison  with  DOFZ  ones.  The 
produced  degradation  of  silicon  detectors  scales  with  luminosity,  and  is  roughly 
independent on particle spectra. If silicon detectors are exposed at primary protons fluxes 
from CR, the degradations are minor, and for these rates of generation of defects, DOFZ 
material  is  more  adequate.  For  higher  rates,  both  materials  present  inversion.  In  Fig.  2, 
the rates corresponding to the beginning of inversion are also presented.

4. Conclusions and Summary 

The  present  model  is  able  to  reproduce  main  features  of  available  experimental  data  of 
FZ and DOFZ Si and permits to understand the mechanisms of degradation. At high rates 
of  generation  of  defects,  the  contribution  of  primary  defects  is  important  and  must  be 
considered. No major differences in degradation between FZ and DOFZ technologies are 
obtained and from this point of view a decision is not possible. Because the processes are 
temperature  dependent,  in  order  to  diminish  these  macroscopic  effects,  the  decrease  of 
the temperature is strongly required.

Abstract: We study soliton reflection/transmission at the interface between 
uniform medium and the optical lattice with focusing Kerr nonlinearity. We 
reveal that such interfaces afford rich new opportunities for controlling the 
reflection  and  transmission  coefficients  and  nonlinear  Snell  law,  the  key 
control parameters being the spatial frequency and depth of the lattice.

The interface between two different nonlinear media has been the subject of study in nonlinear 
optics during the last three decades. Nonlinearity substantially affects the classical Snell law 
of refraction of planar waves as well as Fresnel’s reflection formulas and can lead to optical 
bistability and hoping between regimes of total internal reflection and complete transmission 
[1,2].  The  influence  of  nonlinear  interface  on  light  refraction  was  studied  for  focused  laser 
beams both theoretically [3-6] and experimentally [7-10], in cubic and in quadratic nonlinear 
media.  Laser  beams  can  excite  localized  surface  waves  at  a  single  interface  if  one  of  the 
materials forming the interface possesses nonlocal nonlinear response [11]. Surface waves can 
also be formed at the interface of linear dielectric and periodic layered media [12]. 

Beam refraction at nonlinear interfaces can potentially be used for beam steering, routing, 
and  switching.  Photorefractive  materials  and  nonlinear  semiconductors  (such  as  AlGaAs) 
offer  an  excellent  opportunity  for  experimentation  at  moderate  power  levels.  The  important 
fact is that photorefractive materials can be used for optical induction of photonic lattices [13-
16],  while  nonlinear  semiconductors  allows  the  fabrication  of  the  arrays  of  weakly  coupled 
waveguides  [17-19].  Such  guiding  structures  can  support  lattice  or  discrete  solitons  whose 
properties depart considerably from properties of solitons in the uniform media [13-22]. Thus, 
tunable  beam  refraction  in  infinite  optically  induced  tilted  lattice  was  recently  demonstrated 
experimentally in Ref. [23]. 

Light refraction on nonlinear interfaces is far from being trivial even for the simplest case 
of  uniform  materials,  and  it  has  not  yet  been  explored  in  a  more  challenging  case  of  the 
interface formed by nonlinear uniform media and periodic guiding structures. Such structures 
are practically interesting since they introduce several experimentally controllable parameters, 
namely the features of the lattice. From a fundamental point of view, they are also intriguing 
because the eigenfunctions that correspond to the nonlinear uniform medium are those of the 
Zakharov-Shabat  inverse  scattering  problem  (i.e.,  continuous  Fourier  spectrum  plus  discrete 
eigenvalues linked with the single or multiple solitons), while the eigenfunctions associated in 
the linear limit with photonic lattices are Floquet-Bloch modes. In such a hybrid situation the 
energy flow of soliton falling upon the interface is redistributed between two groups of eigen-
functions  mentioned  above  depending  on  the  interface  properties,  i.e.,  the  lattice  depth  and 
frequency. Understanding and controlling this redistribution is in the focus of this paper. 

We address refraction/reflection of tilted laser beams at the interface of a uniform Kerr-
type nonlinear medium and a nonlinear medium with fabricated or optically induced harmonic 
transverse modulation of refractive index. Since the ability of laser beams to penetrate and to 
propagate in the periodic materials depends strongly on the depth and frequency of refractive 
index  modulation,  it  is  natural  to  expect  that  refraction  scenario  at  such  interface  departs 
crucially from refraction at interface of two uniform media and allow for new regimes of light 
switching and routing. 

For the sake of generality we consider propagation of tilted slit laser beam at an interface 
of uniform and periodic materials with Kerr-type cubic focusing nonlinearity described by the 
nonlinear Schrödinger equation for the dimensionless complex amplitude of light field q :

cannot substantially modify the refraction law for intense laser beams. Such specific refractive 
index  landscapes  R can  be  either  technologically  fabricated  in  semiconductors  that  were 
used for creation of discrete waveguide arrays [17-19], or they can be induced optically by the 
interference pattern formed in the photorefractive crystal, provided that the refractive index of 
one  part  of  the  crystal  is  modified,  for  example,  by  the  ion  implantation.  In  the  latter  case 
vectorial interactions can be used to guide soliton beam in optically induced lattices [13-16],

regime of laser beam in periodic structure is not the width of beam itself but rather the ratio of 
the beam width to lattice period (or ratio of lattice frequency to form-factor) [21], in numerical 
simulations we fixed the input soliton width (that also determines its energy flow) by setting

refraction scenarios at the interface between uniform medium and the lattice. The lattice depth 
and frequency can be tuned by adjusting the propagation angles and intensities of interfering 
plane waves, which induce the lattice. We assume that the lattice depth is of the order of the 
nonlinear contribution to the refractive index, thus we consider the range

We  found  that  the  beam  reflection/refraction  scenario  at  the  interface  depends  crucially 
on the lattice frequency (see Figs. 1(b)-1(d)). In the high-frequency lattice  (
 soliton is 
almost  unaffected by periodic  character of refractive  index modulation since  it covers  many 
lattice periods and feels only mean refractive index of the lattice or, in other words, the soliton 
spatial spectrum does not overlap with the Bragg-reflection band. Under such conditions sech-
type spatial soliton is almost totally transmitted into the lattice (Fig. 1(b)), provided that the 
transmission angle is less than the Bragg reflection angle  α
. Notice, that light beam 
is transmitted with high soliton content (Fig. 1(b)), which means that almost the whole energy 
associated to the Zakharov-Shabat spectrum converts into soliton moving across the lattice. In 
this particular case, a simple analytical effective index approximation can be used to derive an 
estimate for the transmission angle

When  lattice  frequency  Ω  decreases,  the  condition  of  Bragg  reflection  α

 for 
transmitted beam can be met. Around this Bragg frequency the reflection coefficient growths 
dramatically, and upon interaction with interface soliton bounces back into uniform nonlinear 
media (Fig. 1(c)), so that almost the whole energy remains with the Zakharov-Shabat discrete 
eigenmode. For a lattice with a low frequency belonging to the Bragg-transmission band the 
beam  reflection  is  suppressed  (Fig.  1(d)).  Notice  that  in  this  latter  case  radiative  losses  for 
solitons moving across the lattice are important, because when soliton crosses the successive 
waveguides it leaves there some small fraction of energy due to the overlap of low-frequency 
wing of the soliton spatial spectrum (which is centered at 
) with spatial spectrum of guided 
mode that is centered at zero spatial frequency. This process is clearly visible in Fig. 1(d). The 
excitation of Floquet-Bloch modes is also possible, as it was demonstrated experimentally in 
Ref. [17], in a different regime than the one we explore here.

Large enhancement of the reflection efficiency at  Ω ≈
 due to the distributed Bragg-type 
scattering and formation of well-defined reflection band should be pointed out. Notice, that in 
the high-frequency limit  (
 energy reflection is determined primarily by the step of the 
averaged  refractive  index  profile.  The  transmission  angle  α  notably  varies  with  frequency 
Ω
 at  the  edges  of  Bragg  reflection  band  (Fig.  2(b))  that  is  typical  for  linear  reflection  from 
periodic  structures  such  as  layered dielectric  mirrors. In  a  high-frequency  limit  Ω →  the 
transmission angle is almost independent on  Ω  in accordance with results of effective index 
approximation and approaches the value  α
(=
. Notice that in deeper lattices 
the Bragg reflection band shifts into the high-frequency region (this is also consistent with the 
results  of  the  analytical  effective  index  approximation  that  predicts  increase  of  α ,  hence 
BΩ
, with  p ), while the maximal amount of reflected energy increases significantly. The shift 
of low-frequency edge of Bragg reflection band toward higher values of  Ω  with growth of the 
lattice modulation depth  p  introduces an unexpected dependence of the reflected energy U  
on  p  for fixed 
 (Fig. 2(c)). In this case the initial growth of reflected energy U  
with  increase  of  p  is  replaced  by  rapid  diminishing  when  the  edge  of  the  reflectance  band 
shifts to the high-frequency region. This characteristic feature of Bragg-type soliton mirror is 
important, as the modulation depth as well as lattice frequency could serve as effective control 
parameters for routing. Figure 2(d) shows the dependence of the transmission angle on lattice 
depth.  The  dependence  α
 is  nonmonotonic;  rapid  variations  of  α  are  obtained  at  the 
edges of Bragg-reflection band, illustrating the possibility to control not only the transmission 
coefficient,  but  also  soliton  propagation  paths.  The  analytical  effective  index  approximation 
<
(Fig. 2(d)) holds only in shallow lattices  (
, stressing the differences existing between 
mechanisms  of  refraction  at  the  interface  of  uniform  media  and  interface  with  the  lattice  at 
p >
. Figure 2(e) illustrates the dependence of transmitted energy (that was also calculated 
) on the incident angle  α . It is clear that the Bragg-type soliton 
at the distance

strong refraction is found at small incident angles, when soliton is launched almost parallel to

Therefore, in summary, we uncovered new important properties of soliton reflection and 
refraction at the interface formed by uniform and periodic nonlinear materials with focusing 
Kerr-type nonlinearity. Such Bragg-type nonlinear mirror offers new opportunities for control 
of reflection efficiency and beam propagation paths, because the refraction process is strongly 
sensitive to variations in depth and frequency of the periodic refractive index modulation. We 
stress the robustness of the result reported, in terms of particular values of physical parameters 
describing the interface, and the high soliton content of the reflected or transmitted beams.

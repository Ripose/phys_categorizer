On a Smooth Horizontal Plane

Abstract 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The article treats the classical problem of stability of steady rotation of a rigid 

homogeneous  ellipsoid  on  a  rigid  smooth  plane  which  rotates  about  its 

vertical axis. The condition for the steady rotation is derived from the Euler-

Poisson equations. 

1. Introduction 

The problem which will be discussed follows (Routh [1], pp 202 §252 Example. 2): 'An 

ellipsoid  is  placed  with  one  of  its  vertices  in  contact  with  a  smooth  horizontal  plane. 

What angular velocity of rotation must it have about the vertical axis in order that the 

equilibrium may be stable?'  

As  was  noted  by  Routh  ([1],)  the  problem  was  solved  by  M.Puiseux  in  1852  and  he 

gives result: ‘Let a, b, c be the semi-axes, c the vertical axis, then the angular velocity 

must  be  grater  than 

’.  The  details  of  how  the  solution  was

obtained are not provided except the note that M.Puiseux derives it from Euler-Poisson 

equations. 

While the interested reader can probably obtain the solution from the original source, it 

is  surprising  that  (to  the  author’s  knowledge)  the  solution  of  the  problem  can  not  be 

found  in  any  standard  textbook  (historical  or  contemporary)  dealing  with  rigid  body 

dynamics neither as  example  nor  as  an exercise (with the exception of Routh's book). 

Yet the problem is a good illustration of a holonomic system that has a relatively simple 

1

analytical solution. The purpose of the present article is to provide the detailed solution 

of the problem. 

2. Equations 

Consider that the homogeneous ellipsoid of mass m rolls on a smooth horizontal plane 

under the influence of the uniform gravitational field characterized by the acceleration 

g.  Let  {

To  calculate  the  coordinates  of  the  contact  point  and  vertical  position  of  the  centre  of 

mass  point  two  more  equations  are  needed.  These  are  obtained  from  the  requirement 

that at contact point the normal n to the ellipsoid surface is parallel to the normal plane;

These formulas are obtained by Poisson in a slightly different way (Poisson [3] pp 184) 

Dynamics.  The forces acting on the ellipsoid are the gravity and the reaction force at 

contact point. The later is given by

(11) 

The magnitude of the reaction force F is calculated by Newton’s law 

Because  all  the  forces  acts  in  the  vertical  direction,  the  remaining  equations  for 

movement of the centre of the mass are

These  equations  show  that  the  projection  of  the  centre  of  the  mass  point  on  the  plane 

moves in a straight line or stands still.

3. Stability of steady motion 

The  classical  analysis  of  the  stability  of  steady  motion  is  based  on  consideration  of 

steady motion perturbation. To perform this, first the angular orientation of the ellipsoid 

must  be  specified.  Here  for  the  angular  orientation  the  Bryant  angles  will  be  used,  

which are obtained by the consecutive rotations through the angle 

1θ  about the axis 

1ξ , 

then through the angle 

2θ about intermediary 

2ξ  and finally through the angle 

3θ about 

intermediary 

3ξ  axis (see Appendix). In the present case, however, because the ellipsoid 

uniform  rotates  about  the  vertical,  the  rotation  about 

3ξ   axis  is  through  the  angle 

tω θ+

It can be shown that the first condition - except for the case 

a
1

=

a
2

=

a
3

 - gives lower 

values of 

0ω  than the third condition. In this way, one controls stability. By multiplying 

its  numerator  and  denominator  with

  and  taking  the 

square root one obtains the condition for steady stable vertical rotation in the form

This  matches  Puiseux's  solution.  Further,  the  second  condition  of  (31)  implies  that  in 

addition one must have

In other words: for stability the vertical semi axis of an ellipsoid should be the largest or 

the smallest of the ellipsoid's semi axes. Condition (32) is for the case when 

3a  is the 

largest, if 

3a is the smallest then the vertical rotation is stable for any angular velocity 

0ω .

Abstract 
 

This dissertation is concerned with understanding and analyzing some of the 

effects of diffraction in the near field.  The near field has become of interest at optical 

wavelengths  with  the  advent  of  promising  applications  such  as  near-field  optical 

microscopy, near-field spectroscopy and high-density optical data storage. 

First,  a  comprehensive  review 

is  presented  of 

the  scalar  and 

the 

electromagnetic theories of diffraction by an aperture in a planar opaque screen.  Two 

new theorems concerning the behavior of the phase near extrema of the amplitude are 

established  that  provide  a  novel  insight  into  the  relationship  between  the  amplitude 

and the phase of the field in diffraction patterns. 

The  contributions  of  homogeneous  and  of  evanescent  waves  to  two-

dimensional near-field diffraction patterns of scalar fields are then examined in detail.  

Exact  relations  are  obtained  for  calculating  these  contributions  for  arbitrary 

propagation  distances,  along  with  approximate  expressions  for  the  near  field.    The 

behavior of the two contributions is illustrated for the case of a plane wave diffracted 

by a slit in an opaque screen. 

 

The  finite-difference  time-domain  (FD-TD)  method  is  used  examine  the 

influence  of  exact  boundary  values  on  the  near  field  for  the  case  of  a  slit  in  a  thin 

perfectly  conducting  screen.    The  FD-TD  numerical  results  are  displayed  in  color 

images that illustrate the intricate behavior of the amplitude and the phase of the field 

in the vicinity of the slit.  These numerical results are compared with the predictions 

of approximate theories. 

 

Some  new  methods  for  determining  near-fields  in  rigorous  diffraction 

problems  involving  thin  screens  are  discussed.    Specifically,  new  approximate 

 

vii 

theories of diffraction are introduced for both scalar and electromagnetic fields and an 

iterative Fourier-based algorithm is proposed for solving the rigorous boundary value 

 

 

problem. 

In order to understand the effects of an optical vortex on diffraction, the field 

emerging from a spiral phase plate illuminated by a Gaussian beam is examined.  It is 

shown  that  the  amplitude  profile  of  the  emerging  field  changes  appreciably  over 

propagation distances that are much smaller than the Rayleigh range.

CHAPTER 1 
 

INTRODUCTION 

1.1  DIFFRACTION OF LIGHT 
 

The early observations of diffraction of light by an obstacle were the primary 

pieces of evidence for the adoption of the wave theory of light.1-3  Despite the fact 

that  diffraction  phenomena  were  first  described  in  detail  more  than  three  centuries 

ago, the theory of diffraction continues to be a subject of great interest today in many 

branches of both basic and applied physics. 

The analysis of diffraction of light by an aperture in a planar opaque screen*†  

can  be  separated  into  the  treatment  of  two  distinct  problems‡:  the  boundary  value 

problem  and  the  propagation  problem.    The  boundary  value  problem  consists  of 

determining  the  boundary  value  of  the  field  in  the  plane  immediately  behind  the 

screen for a given illuminating field, given material characteristics of the screen and a 

given  aperture  shape.    The  propagation  problem  involves  finding  the  field  at  some 

distance behind the screen from this boundary field. 

                                                                                                                                           
* We take an opaque screen to be one for which the normal component of the energy flux vector is 
identically zero over the portion of the screen in the shadow region.  Therefore, in our terminology, a 
perfectly conducting screen is opaque even though it is highly reflecting.  However, other definitions 
of opaque screens are often used in the literature 

† An extensive review of scalar and electromagnetic diffraction can be found in Ref. 4.  References to 
more recent work are given in Refs. 5-7. 

‡  As  is  stressed  in  Ref.  8,  this  approach  can  sometimes  simplify  the  analysis  of  rigorous  diffraction 
problems. 

 

 

 

2 

The  approach  one  uses  to  solve  the  propagation  problem  is  straightforward, 

although  there  can  be  some  computational  difficulties  in  evaluating  the  necessary 

integrals:  one  simply  applies  the  appropriate  propagator  (diffraction  formula)  to  the 

boundary  field.    However,  the  boundary  field  itself  is  very  difficult  to  determine, 

especially  if  the  optical  field  is  treated  by  full  electromagnetic  theory.    For  the 

idealized  case  of  an  electromagnetic  field  incident  upon  an  infinitely  thin  perfectly 

conducting  screen,  analytic  solutions  have  been  obtained  for  a  small  number  of 

geometries*,  including  the  half-plane,8-10  the  slit4,11  and  the  circular  aperture4,12,13 

(see  also  Ref.  6,  Chapters  4,  8  and  14),  along  with  the  complementary  strip  and 

circular disk geometries.  But the analytic results for the slit and the circular aperture 

are  not  always  useful  in  practice,  because  they  contain  infinite  series  that  converge 

slowly  when  the  linear  dimensions  of  the  aperture  are  larger  than  about  one 

wavelength. 

 

In  optics,  one  usually  treats  the  electromagnetic  field  by  a  scalar  model  and 

one  simplifies  the  boundary  value  problem  by  approximating  the  (scalar)  boundary 

field  by  the  unperturbed  incident  field.    The  diffraction  theory  based  on  this 

approximation is sometimes called the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld theory of the first kind.  

Two  other  approximate  diffraction  theories  are  also  occasionally  used:14-18  the 

Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theory  of  the  second  kind  and  the  older  classic  Kirchhoff 

theory.    Even  though  the  boundary  fields  given  by  the  three  theories  are  very 

different,  all  three  often  yield  nearly  identical  results,  and  agree  very  well  with 

experimental observations, when the size of the aperture and the propagation distance 

are both much larger than the wavelength.  These conditions are usually satisfied in 

conventional optics, but they are not satisfied in near-field optics. 

                                                                                                                                           
* For these same geometries, analytic solutions exist for scalar fields interacting with Dirichlet-type or 
Neumann-type screens.

1.2  THE NEAR FIELD 
 

For our purposes, the near zone of a radiating, scattering or diffracting object 

in  free  space  will  be  considered  to  be  the  region  of  space  where  there  are  non-

negligible  contributions  from  evanescent  waves  associated  with  high  spatial 

frequencies  of  the  field.    Specifically,  if 

  is  the  Fourier  transform  of  the 

˜ U o( fx , fy )

field U

o(x,y) in a plane in close proximity to the object, 

˜ U o( fx , fy )  =   Uo(x, y)

∫∫

(

 ei

fxx + fyy

) dx dy  , 

(1.2.1) 

and if 

˜ U d ( fx , fy )

d,  then  those  spatial  frequencies 

 is the corresponding Fourier transform after a propagation distance 
2  >  k   (k  being  the 

fx   and  fy   for  which 

2 + fy
fx

free-space wavenumber) are exponentially attenuated so that 

˜ U d ( fx , fy )  =   ˜ U o( fx, fy )  exp −d fx

2 + fy

2 − k2

⎡ 
⎣ 

⎤ 
 . 
⎦ 

(1.2.2) 

Hence, for any evanescent waves to be present, the distance d can be at most of the 

order of the wavelength.  The resolution of conventional optical systems is therefore 

fundamentally limited by the wavelength λ, since the propagation distances involved 

are several orders of magnitude larger than λ (see Fig. 1-1). 

Optical  systems  that  interact  directly  with  the  near  field  can  overcome  this 

resolution limit.  Recently, there has been considerable interest in these systems19-24 

stemming  from  promising  applications  such  as  near-field  optical  microscopy,  near-

field  spectroscopy  and  high-density  optical  data  storage.    The  near-field  interaction 

can  be  accomplished  by  a  variety  of  schemes,  for  example,  with  a  sub-wavelength 

fiber optic probe or a sub-wavelength aperture which is scanned at the distance from 

the object that is smaller than the wavelength (see Fig. 1-2).  However, the interaction 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

4 

is very complicated and it is difficult to interpret experimental data.  Consequently, 

there  has  been  significant  interest  in  using  rigorous  diffraction  theories25-28  and 

numerical  simulations29,30  to  model  the  sub-wavelength  near-field  probe  and  the 

probe-object interaction. 

It should be pointed out that near-field measurements of antennas have been 

used for several decades as a means of determining far-field radiation patterns.31-33  

However,  these  types  of  near-field  measurements  can  be  performed  at  distances 

larger than the wavelength, because evanescent waves are of no importance to the far 

field.

1.3  OVERVIEW OF THE THESIS 
 

This  thesis  is  concerned  with  the  effects  of  diffraction  in  the  near  field.  

Although the primary motivation for this work is near-field optics, the results of the 

research are also applicable to longer wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation and to 

acoustics.    In  fact,  the  new  methods  for  aperture  diffraction  presented  in  Chapter  5 

should be useful for aperture antenna analysis and design. 

Chapter 2 contains an introductory discussion of the theory of diffraction by 

an  aperture  in  a  planar  opaque  screen  for  both  the  scalar  and  the  electromagnetic 

cases.    The  discussion  provides  the  theoretical  background  for  the  analysis  in  the 

subsequent  chapters.    It  includes  a  review  of  boundary  conditions,  exact  and 

approximate  diffraction  formulas,  the  angular  spectrum  representation,  the  Bessel-

beam  representation  and  energy  flow.    In  addition,  two  new  theorems  are  proven 

concerning the behavior of the phase of a scalar field near extrema of the amplitude. 

 

Chapter  3  examines,  in  detail,  the  contributions  of  homogeneous  and  of 

evanescent  waves  to  two-dimensional  near-field diffraction patterns of scalar fields.  

Exact  relations  are  derived  for  calculating  these  two  contributions  for  arbitrary 

propagation  distances,  along  with  approximate  expressions  for  the  near  field.    The 

behavior of the two contributions is illustrated for the case of a plane wave diffracted 

by a slit in an opaque screen, with the use of approximate boundary conditions. 

 

In Chapter 4, the near-field in the slit diffraction problem is then reexamined 

with rigorous boundary conditions appropriate to a thin perfectly conducting screen.  

Because it is not efficient to determine the near-field at many points in space from the 

exact series solution, the finite-difference time-domain method is used to numerically 

evaluate the near field.  These numerical results are compared with the predictions of 

the  approximate  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theories.    The  validity  of  two  theorems  of 

 

 

 

6 

Chapter  2  on  the  behavior  of  the  phase  near  extrema  of  the  amplitude  is  readily 

observed in the near-field diffraction patterns.  

Chapter 5 introduces some new, relatively untested methods for determining 

the  near-field  in  rigorous  aperture  diffraction  problems.    First,  in  Section  5.1,  two 

new approximate scalar theories of diffraction are described that are based on simple 

modifications  of  the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theories.    These  new  scalar  theories  are 

formulated  for  thin  Dirichlet-type  and  Neumann-type  screens.    New  approximate 

electromagnetic  theories  of  diffraction,  intended  for  thin  perfectly  conducting 

screens,  are  also  discussed.    Then,  in  Section  5.2,  a  new  iterative  Fourier-based 

algorithm  for  numerically  solving  the  rigorous  boundary  value  is  proposed.    The 

algorithm is obtained from dual integral equations for angular spectrum amplitude of 

the  transmitted  field  and  can  be  implemented  for  scalar  fields  incident  upon  either 

Dirichlet-type or Neumann-type screens, and also for electromagnetic fields incident 

upon perfectly conducting screens. 

 

The last main chapter, Chapter 6, deals with a particular structure in the field 

that  can  only  occur  in  three-dimensional  diffraction,  namely,  the  optical  vortex  or 

screw  dislocation.    The  main  aim  of  that  chapter  is  to  show,  by  a  realistic  example 

consisting of a spiral phase plate illuminated by a Gaussian beam, that the presence of 

a vortex can dramatically affect the diffraction of a field over very small propagation 

distances.    Although  the  distances  are  larger  than  the  wavelength,  they  are  much 

smaller  than  the  Rayleigh  range.    This  result  is  rather  surprising  since,  for  most 

beams,  the  amplitude  profile  is  unchanged  for  propagation  distances  considerably 

smaller than the Rayleigh range.

CHAPTER 2 
 

APERTURE DIFFRACTION THEORY 

 

In  this  Chapter,  we  discuss  some  fundamental  aspects  of  the  theory  of 

diffraction of light by an aperture in a planar opaque screen.  We consider the scalar 

and the electromagnetic cases separately and point out some of the basic differences 

between them.  There are, in fact, a number of subtleties contained in the formulation 

of approximate electromagnetic theories of diffraction that are not encountered in the 

scalar case: a naive treatment can yield vector theories that do not satisfy Maxwell's 

equations. 

 

Much  of  the  material  covered  in  this  chapter  is  available  in  the  published 
literature.1-6  However, the Bessel-beam representation of the field, which we present 

in  Section  2.1.4,  is  rarely  discussed  in  any  detail  within  the  context  of  aperture 

diffraction.  Furthermore, the analysis in Section 2.1.6 concerning the behavior of the 

phase near extrema of the amplitude appears to be new. 

2.1  SCALAR THEORY OF DIFFRACTION 
 

We shall first assume that the optical field may be described accurately by a 

scalar theory.7-9  One situation where such a description is completely adequate is the 

case of two-dimensional diffraction, discussed in Section 2.2.4. 

We  consider  a  monochromatic  scalar  field  V

(inc)(r,t) = U(inc)(r)exp{−iω t}

, 

r = (x, y, z), of frequency ω that is incident from the half-space z < 0 upon an aperture 

 

11 

A in a thin, planar, opaque screen S (see Fig. 2-1).  We take the screen to be located 

in  the  plane z = 0 and the rest of space to be free of matter.  If we denote the total 

field by  U , then both  U

(r)

 and  U  satisfy the Helmholtz equation in free-

) U(r)  =  0  , 

 
where ∇2 ≡ ∂2 ∂ x2 +∂2 ∂ y2 + ∂2 ∂ z2  is the Laplacian and

2.1.1  Boundary Conditions 

To  obtain  a  solution  for  the  field  U ,  the  boundary  conditions  in  the 

(r)

aperture  plane  z  =  0  need  to  be  specified.    Since  in  free  space  the  field  and  its 

derivatives  are  continuous  at  every  point,  the  field  inside  the  aperture  and  its  z-

derivative must also be continuous.  Hence  

  U(ρ,0 + )  =  U(ρ, 0− )

in A 

(2.1.4) 

and 

∂ U(ρ, z)
∂ z

 

  

z= 0+

=  

∂ U(ρ, z)

in A , 

(2.1.5) 

 
where  ρ = (x, y)   and  the  notation*  0−  (0+ )  indicates  the  limit  as  z  approaches  zero 

from  the  negative  (positive)  z-direction.    On  the  surface  of  an  infinitesimally  thin 

opaque  screen,  two  different  kinds  of  boundary  conditions  are  usually  applied  to  a 

scalar field:1,4 Dirichlet conditions, for which the field is zero, 

   DU (ρ,0) = 0

on S  , 

(2.1.6) 

or Neumann conditions, for which the normal derivative is zero, 
 

∂ UN (ρ, z)
∂ z

 

  

z =0

=  0

on S  . 

(2.1.7) 

A  screen  that  satisfies  Dirichlet  boundary  conditions  is  sometimes  said  to  be  soft, 

while a Neumann-type one is sometimes said to be hard.  Both may be termed opaque 

because, on S, the normal component of the energy flux vector is identically zero in 

either case (see Section 2.1.6). 
                                                                                                                                           
* We will also use this notation when we are referring to a specific side of the plane z = 0 where the 
screen is located.  Whenever z = 0 appears without a superscript, the equations apply to both sides. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13 

The boundary conditions on the screen together with the continuity conditions 

(2.1.4)  and  (2.1.5)  completely  describe  what  happens  to  the  field  as  it  traverses  the 

plane  z  =  0.    When  the  continuity  conditions  are applied to a Dirichlet-type screen, 

one finds that the z-derivative of the field in the aperture is equal to the z-derivative of 

∂ UD(ρ,z )
∂ z

 

  

z =0

=  

∂ U(inc)(ρ,z)
∂ z

 

z =0

in A . 

(2.1.8) 

However, when they are applied to a Neumann-type screen, the field in the aperture is 

the incident field, 
 

 

 

simply the incident field,  
 

  UN (ρ,0)  =  U (inc)(ρ,0)

in A . 

(2.1.9) 

Thus,  the  aperture  diffraction  problem  is  now  posed  as  a  mixed*  boundary 

value  problem.10    For  the  Dirichlet-type  screen,  the  field  must  satisfy  the  mixed 

boundary conditions given by Eqs. (2.1.6) and (2.1.8) whereas, for the Neumann-type 

screen, it must satisfy those given by Eqs. (2.1.7) and (2.1.9).  

Although  at  first  it  might  appear  that,  for  a  given  incident  field,  the  above 

mixed  boundary  conditions  together  with  the  radiation  condition  should  uniquely 

specify  the  field  U   everywhere  in  space,  there  can,  in  general,  exist  an  infinite 

(r)

number  of  solutions  for  U   (see  Ref.  4,  Chapter  9,  or  Ref.  11).    This  non-

(r)

uniqueness,  which  is  not  present  in  continuously  varying  media,  can  occur  here 

because  of  the  sharp  edge  of  the  aperture.    However,  only  one  of  the  solutions  is 

physically  sensible.  The  others  contain  singularities  that  act  as  primary  sources  of 

                                                                                                                                           
*  A  boundary  value  problem  is  said  to  be  mixed  when  the  field  is  specified  over  some  portion  of  a 
surface and its normal derivative is specified over the remaining portion.

radiation.    It  is  possible  to  choose  the  correct  one  by  applying  the  so-called  edge 

conditions.4,11,12    We  shall  not  discuss  these  edge  conditions  further  here,  but  it 

should be pointed out that the numerical results given in Chapter 4 do, in fact, satisfy 

them. 

2.1.2  The Rayleigh Diffraction Formulas 

Let us suppose that the boundary value problem has been solved and that the 
(ρ,0 + )

  behind the screen is known for all values of ρ.  Then the field  U

(ρ,z)  

field  U

in the half-space z ≥ 0 can be determined from Rayleigh's first diffraction 

formula (see Ref. 3, Chapter 5, or Ref. 13), 
 

U(ρ,z)  =   –

Here the integration is over the entire plane  z = 0+  and the function  
 

G(ρ,z )  =  

eik ρ2+  z 2
ρ2 +  z2  , 

(2.1.11) 

 

 

 
ρ= ρ = x2 + y2 , is the three-dimensional free-space Green function that obeys the 

radiation condition at infinity.  Alternatively, if the boundary value of the derivative 

∂ U(ρ, z) ∂ z   z =0+  is known for all values of ρ, U(ρ,z ≥ 0) can be determined from 
Rayleigh's second diffraction formula (see Ref. 3, Chapter 5, or Ref. 13), 

 

U(ρ,z)  =   –

Obviously,  if  both  U

(ρ,0 + )

  and 

∂ U(ρ, z) ∂ z   z =0+   are  known  exactly,  the  two 

Rayleigh formulas yield the same result and so does the linear superposition

2.1.3  The Angular Spectrum Representation 

A  representation  in  terms  of  an  angular  spectrum  of  plane  waves  can  often 

provide more insight into the propagation of the field than do the Rayleigh diffraction 

formulas.  With this representation, the field in the half-space z ≥ 0 may be expressed 

in the form13-15 
 

∫
U(ρ,z)  =   a(u⊥ ) 

eiku⊥• ρ eikuz z d2u⊥ , 

(2.1.14) 

where  the  integration  extends  over  all  real  transverse  vectors  u

⊥ ≡ (ux ,uy )

.    The 

(generally complex) angular spectrum amplitude  a

(u⊥)  determines the amplitude of 

the  plane  wave  specified  by  the  unit  vector  u ≡ (u x,uy ,uz).    The  longitudinal 

component of this vector is given by the formulas

The  waves  associated  with  Eq.  (2.1.15a)  are  the  usual  homogeneous  plane  waves, 

with  phase  fronts  perpendicular  to  the  vector  u  [see  Fig.  2-2(a)].    Those  associated 

with Eq. (2.1.15b) are evanescent (inhomogeneous) plane waves whose phase fronts 

are  perpendicular  to  u   and  whose  amplitudes  decay  exponentially  with  increasing 

distance z from the aperture [see Fig. 2-2(b)]. 

By  setting  z = 0   in  Eq.  (2.1.14)  and  performing  a  Fourier  transform 

transform  with  respect  to  ρ,  one  finds  that  the  angular  spectrum  amplitude  a
may be determined from the field distribution U(ρ,0 + ) via the relation

a spherical wave,13

(2.1.18) 

By substituting either Eq. (2.1.16) or (2.1.17) into Eq. (2.1.14) and making use of this 

expansion, one obtains Rayleigh's first or second diffraction formula, respectively. 

2.1.4  The Bessel-Beam Representation 

It is possible to introduce a representation that is completely equivalent to the 

angular  spectrum  representation,  but  which  contains  nondiffracting  and  evanescent 

Bessel-beams  instead  of  homogeneous  and  evanescent  plane  waves.    This  Bessel-

beam  representation16,17  (see  also  Ref.  5,  Section  4.11)  is  rarely  used  as  a  starting 

point in propagation and diffraction problems, but it is often applied to problems of 

scattering  and  waveguiding  by  circular  cylinders,  where  it  is  sometimes  called  a 

cylindrical wave expansion.18 

 

Nondiffracting  Bessel  beams  have  themselves  been  of  considerable  interest 

recently19-23 because their intensity distribution does not change on propagation and, 

therefore,  they  have  infinite  depth  of  focus.    Unfortunately,  they  also  have  infinite 

energy.    Hence,  in  practice,  such  beams  can  only  be  approximated  over  a  finite 

propagation distance. 

 

18 

To  obtain  the  Bessel-beam  representation  from  the  angular  spectrum 

representation, we expand the angular spectrum amplitude in a Fourier series over the 

angular domain of u : ⊥

2.1.5  The Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Theories and the Kirchhoff Theory 

The  various  diffraction  formulas  given  in  Sections  (2.1.2)-(2.1.4)  make  it 

possible  to  calculate  the  field  U(ρ,z)   throughout  the  half-space  z  ≥  0  from  the 

(ρ,0 + )

boundary value  U

 of the field or from the boundary value 

∂ U(ρ, z) ∂ z   z =0+  
of  its  derivative.    However,  the  rigorous  diffraction  problem  is  posed  as  a  mixed 
boundary problem (see Section 2.1.1) and it is difficult to determine either  U(ρ,0 + ) 

or ∂ U(ρ, z) ∂ z   z =0+  for all values of ρ.  Therefore, one often resorts to theories that 
contain  approximate  boundary  values.    We  will  discuss  three  of  these  approximate 

theories here: the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld theories of the first and the second kinds and 

the Kirchhoff theory.26-28  These are the ones used most often in optics.  Although 

they were not originally intended to be used as approximations for field diffracted by 

apertures  in  Dirichlet-type  or  Neumann-type  screens,  they  are  frequently  used  for 

such screens, especially in comparisons with exact results (see, for example, Refs. 26 

and 29). 

 

 

and 

 

 
In  the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theory  of  the  first  kind,  the  field,  denoted  by 
U(I )(ρ,z) ,  is  obtained  by  approximating  the  boundary  values  in  Rayleigh's  first 

diffraction formula (2.1.10) by 

  U(I )(ρ,0+ )  =  0

on S  

(2.1.31a) 

 

22 

  U(I )(ρ,0+ )  =  U(inc)(ρ,0)

in A , 

(2.1.31b) 

i.e., it is assumed that the field on the screen is zero in the shadow region and that the 
field in the aperture is simply the unperturbed incident field.  Therefore,  U(I )(ρ,z)  in 

the half-space z ≥ 0 is given by the expression

was  stressed  by  Kottler,30,31  there  are  no  logical  inconsistencies  if  the  Kirchhoff 

 and 

theory is viewed as a solution to a saltus problem, which involves a discontinuity in 

the field and its z-derivative, rather than a boundary value problem.   

 

It  should  be  pointed  out  that,  unlike  the  Eqs.  (2.1.10),  (2.1.12)  and  (2.1.13), 

which all produce the same result for the field distribution in the half-space z ≥ 0 if 
the  boundary  values  U(ρ,0 + )  and  ∂ U(ρ, z) ∂ z   z =0+   are  known  exactly  for  all 
values  of  ρ,  Eqs.  (2.1.32),  (2.1.34)  and  (2.1.37)  each  produce  a  different  result 

because of the approximations that are made to these boundary values.

which  is  similar  to  the  definition  of  the  probability  current  density  in  quantum 

mechanics.  Here the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate and α is a real, positive 

constant  that  depends  on  the  choice  of  units.    From  the  Helmholtz  equation,  it  can 

readily be shown that, in free space, 

F(r)

 obeys the energy conservation law 

∇ • F(r) = 0  . 

(2.1.39) 

In integral form, this conservation law may be written as 
 

F(r) • ˆ n  dσ

  =  0  , 

(2.1.40)

Σ

where Σ is a closed surface with outward unit normal

ˆ z  being a unit vector in the z-direction, and if we choose the surface Σ to consist of 

the aperture A, the opaque screen S and an infinite hemisphere located in the half-

space z > 0, then by virtue of Eq. (2.1.40),  Ftot  is equal to the total energy radiated 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25 

into the far zone*.  With the help of Eqs. (2.1.14) and (2.1.38), we can express  Ftot  in 

terms of angular spectrum amplitude a(u⊥)  as

contains  only  contributions  from  homogeneous  plane  waves.    Equivalently,  if  Eq.

2.1.7  Coupled Amplitude-Phase Equations and the Behavior of the Phase Near 

Extrema of the Amplitude 

We shall digress briefly from our discussion of aperture diffraction to derive 

coupled amplitude-phase equations and to establish two new theorems concerning the 

behavior  of  the  phase  near  extrema  of  the  amplitude.    These  theorems  are  included 

here because they provide a novel insight into the relationship between the amplitude 

                                                                                                                                           
* It can verified that, for both Dirichlet and Neumann-type screens, the integration over the screen S 
does not yield any contribution, because the z-component of the energy flux vector is identically zero 
on S. 
† Although the factor  u  appears in the denominator of the integrand in Eq. (2.1.43) , the integrand is 
n(u⊥ )

⊥
usually  not  singular  because  the  coefficients  c

  contain  a  multiplicative  factor  of  u   [see  Eq. 

⊥

(2.1.20)]. 

 

26 

and the phase of diffracted fields.  They can be used to explain a variety of interesting 

phase  phenomena  including,  for  example,  the  so-called  phase  anomaly  that  occurs 

near a focus (see Ref. 2, Section 8.8.4). 

We can express the field in terms of its amplitude 

A(r)

 and its phase 

φ(r)  as 

U(r)  =  A(r) eiφ(r)  , 

(2.1.44) 

where 

A(r)

  and 

φ(r)   are  real  functions  of  position,  A = U ≥ 0 ,  cosφ= Re U{ } U  

and  sinφ= Im U{ } U .    Because  the  field  and  its  derivatives  are  continuous 

throughout  free  space, 

A

  is  continuous  at  all  points  and 

∇A,  φ  and  ∇φ  are 

continuous at points where 

A

 is non-zero.  If we substitute from Eq. (2.1.44) into the 

Helmholtz equation, we obtain at once the relation 
 

)2
∇2A  +  2i∇A • ∇φ  +  iA∇2φ  −  A ∇φ(

+  k2A  =  0 . 

(2.1.45) 

The real and imaginary parts of Eq. (2.1.45) yield the following coupled amplitude-

phase partial differential equations:

and 

 

 

 

 

Equations  (2.1.46)  and  (2.1.47)  are  completely  equivalent  to  the  Helmholtz 

equation.    The  same  equations  appear  in  the  derivation  of  geometrical  optics  from 

wave theory,35,36 in which case the short-wavelength limit  k

→ ∞

 is of interest.  In 

 

27 

this limit, Eq. (2.1.46) becomes the usual eikonal equation of geometrical optics* (see 

Ref. 2, Chapter 3 or Ref. 5, Chapter 2).  However for finite k, if the amplitude 

A

 is 

known,  Eq.  (2.1.46)  may  be  viewed  as  a  generalized  eikonal  equation  that  includes 

diffraction effects.  It should be mentioned that equations analogous to (2.1.46) and 

(2.1.47) were used in an early attempt to obtain a hydrodynamical model for quantum 

mechanics.37 

 

Let us substitute from Eq. (2.1.44) into expression (2.1.38) for the energy flux 

vector F.  F then takes the simple form†  
  
 

 

F  =  2ωα A2∇φ

 , 

 
and Eqs. (2.1.46) and (2.1.47) may be rewritten as

F2 =  4ω2α2 k 2A4 +  A3∇2A

∇ • F = 0 , 

(2.1.48) 

(2.1.49) 

(2.1.50) 

respectively.  Therefore, since Eq. (2.1.50) is the usual energy conservation law (see 

Section  2.1.6),  Eq.  (2.1.47)  also  expresses  conservation  of  energy.    If  we  write  the 

and 
 
 

 

 

energy flux vector as 
 

F  =  F 

∇φ
∇φ

 , 

(2.1.51) 

 

 

 

we see that the magnitude of F depends only on the amplitude of the field [see Eq. 

(2.1.49)] and its direction depends only on the phase.

* In free space, the eikonal equation is  ∇φ(
. 
† Equation (2.1.48) displays a very simple relationship between the energy flux vector  F , the intensity 
I= A2  and the gradient of the phase  ∇φ.  One might wonder whether an analogous expression can be 
obtained for an electromagnetic field.  This issue is discussed in Appendix A.

28 

We  now  consider  a  point  P(rs)  where  the  amplitude  A  has  a  non-zero 

extremum.    If  A  has  a  maximum  at  P(rs),  then  A(rs) > 0 ,  ∇A(rs ) = 0   and 
∇2A(rs) < 0   (this  notation  has  the  obvious  meaning:  ∇A(rs ) = ∇ A(r)   r=rs
Hence, according to Eqs. (2.1.46) and (2.1.47), 

,  etc.).  

∇φ(rs)   <  k      and     ∇2φ(rs )  =  0  . 

(2.1.52) 

 
However, if A has a non-zero minimum, then  A(rs) > 0 , ∇A(rs ) = 0  and ∇2A(rs) > 0  

 

 

and, consequently, 
 

∇φ(rs)   >  k      and     ∇2φ(rs )  =  0  . 

(2.1.53) 

 
In  the  unusual  case  that  the  amplitude  has  a  non-zero  extremum  with  ∇2A(rs) = 0, 
one has  ∇φ(rs)   =  k . 

Because  the  above  results  are  very  general,  i.e.,  they  apply  to  any  field  that 

satisfies the Helmholtz equation, we shall restate them in the following two theorems.  
 

Theorem  1:    Near  a  point  in  space  where  the  amplitude  has  a  maximum,  the 

Laplacian of the phase is zero and the surfaces of constant phase are spaced further 

apart than the corresponding surfaces for a plane wave with wavenumber k = ω/ c . 

Theorem  2:    Near  a  point  in  space  where  the amplitude has a non-zero minimum, 

the  Laplacian  of  the  phase  is  zero  and  the  surfaces  of  constant  phase  are  spaced 

closer together than the corresponding surfaces for a plane wave with wavenumber 

k = ω/ c . 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29 

 

The  condition  ∇2φ(rs )  =  0   ensures  that  the  wavefront  has  a  certain 
"flatness"  in  the  vicinity  P(rs),  but  this  does  not  imply  that  the  wavefront  is 

necessarily planar in that region.  For example, if we choose our coordinate system so 

that  the  origin  coincides  with  the  point  P(rs)  and  so  that  the  z-axis  is  along  the 

direction of ∇φ(rs) , the phase could be of the form 
 

φ(r)  =  bz  +  d x2 –  y2

(

), 

(2.1.54) 

where b > 0 and d are constants and 

b2  =   k 2 +  

∇2 A(0)
A(0)

 . 

(2.1.55) 

In  this  case,  the  surfaces  of  constant  phase  have  saddle  points  along  the  z-axis. 

However, the phase could not be of the form 

φ(r)  =  

′ b z  +  

(
′ d  x2 +  y2

) , 

(2.1.56) 

i.e.,  the  field  near  an  extemum  of  the  amplitude  cannot  have  a  (paraxial)  spherical 

wavefront. 

 
 

2.2  ELECTROMAGNETIC THEORY OF DIFFRACTION 

We now turn to the electromagnetic theory of diffraction.1,2,38  We consider 

the case of a monochromatic electromagnetic field of frequency ω  incident from the 

half-space z < 0 upon an aperture A in an opaque planar screen S, which is located in 

the  plane  z  =  0  (see  Fig.  2-1).    Throughout  free-space,  the  total  electric  field 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

equation, 
 

requires that 
  

and 

 

30 

E(r)exp{−iω t} and the total magnetic field  H(r) exp{−iω t} obey the time-harmonic, 

source-free Maxwell equations (Gaussian units), 

Consequently,  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  each  also  satisfy  the  Helmholtz 

∇ × E(r) = ikH(r)  , 

∇ × H(r) = – ikE(r) , 

∇ • E(r) = 0  , 

∇ • H(r) = 0 .

2.2.1  Boundary Conditions 

As  in  the  scalar  theory,  the  boundary  conditions  for  the  plane  z  =  0  are 

needed.      The  continuity  of  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  in  the  aperture  simply 

  E(ρ,0 + )  =  E(ρ, 0− )

in A 

(2.2.3a) 

  H(ρ,0+ )  =  H(ρ,0− )

in A . 

(2.2.3b) 

We  will  only  consider  the  case  of  an  electromagnetically  opaque  screen S  that  is  a 

perfect  electric  conductor.    The  tangential  components  of  the  electric  field  and  the 

normal component of the magnetic field are then identically zero on the screen: 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  ˆ z × E(ρ,0) = 0

  ˆ z • H(ρ,0) = 0

on S  , 

on S  . 

31 

(2.2.4) 

(2.2.5) 

When Eqs. (2.2.3a) and (2.2.3b) are used in conjunction with Eqs. (2.2.4) and 

(2.2.5), one finds that, in the aperture A, the z-component of the electric field and the 

x-  and  y-components  of  the  magnetic  field  are  unaltered  from  their  values  in  the 

absence  of  the  screen.1,38    Hence,  if  we  denote  the  incident  electric  and  magnetic 

(inc)

 and H

(inc)

,  

fields by E
 

  ˆ z • E(ρ, 0)  =  ˆ z • E(inc)(ρ,0)

in A

 , 

(2.2.6) 

  ˆ z × H(ρ, 0)  =  ˆ z × H(inc)(ρ,0)

in A

 . 

(2.2.7) 

Since  the  electromagnetic  field  components  specified  on  the  screen  [Eqs. 

(2.2.4) and (2.2.5)] are different from those specified in the aperture [Eqs. (2.2.6) and 

(2.2.7)], the electromagnetic aperture diffraction problem is a mixed boundary value 

problem.  However, the vector nature of this mixed boundary value problem makes it 

more complicated than the one that occurs in scalar diffraction. 

It  should  be  pointed  out  that  here,  as  in  the  scalar  case,  the  boundary 

conditions  together  with  the  radiation  condition do not ensure a unique solution for 

the  electromagnetic  field.    Fortunately,  edge  conditions  can  again  be  invoked  to 

determine which solution is physically realizable.4,11,12 

2.2.2  Exact Diffraction Formulas 

 
z = 0+

If  all  of  the  components  of  electromagnetic  field  were  known  in  the  plane 

 for all values of ρ, we could apply Rayleigh's first diffraction formula (2.1.10) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

32 

to  each  to  compute  the  field  in  the  half-space  z  ≥  0.    The  corresponding  vector 

diffraction formulas would then be of the form 
 

E(ρ, z)  =   –

E( ′ ρ ,0+ )

G(ρ,z )

  is  the  free-space  Green  function.    We  could  also  use  Rayleigh's  second 

diffraction formula (2.1.12) to determine E and H: 
 

E(ρ, z)  =   –

(2.2.9b) 

 

 

 

 

These  two  sets  of  diffraction  formulas,  Eqs.  (2.2.8a)-(2.2.9b),  are  formally 

correct  because,  in  the  half-space  z  ≥  0,  all  six  components  of  the  electromagnetic 

field  satisfy  the  Helmholtz  equation.    However,  as  a  consequence  of  Maxwell's 

equations,  only  two  components  are  actually  independent.    Equations  (2.2.8a)-

(2.2.9b)  therefore  make  use  of  more  information  than  is  necessary.    Furthermore,  a 

complication  arises  if  one  naively  attempts  to  obtain  approximate  theories  starting 

from  Eqs.  (2.2.8a)-(2.2.9b):  the  resulting  expressions  can  violate  Maxwell's 
equations.  For example, if in Eq. (2.2.8a) E(ρ,0 + ) is approximated by 
 

  E(ρ,0 + )  =  0

on S  

(2.2.10a) 

 

 

and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  E(ρ,0 + )  =  E(inc)(ρ,0)

in A , 

33 

(2.2.10b) 

 

 

 

 

 

the resulting electric field is not divergence-free*. 

There are several different electromagnetic diffraction formulas that overcome 

the  inadequacies  of  Eqs.  (2.2.8a)-(2.2.9b),  but  they  are  all  equivalent  to  each  other 

when no approximations are made to the boundary values of the field.  We will only 

discuss some of these diffraction formulas here. 

 
It is possible to express the electric and magnetic fields in the half-space z ≥ 0 
in  terms  of  the  tangential  electric  field  in  the  plane  z = 0+   by  the  use  of  the 

relations42,43

(2.2.12b) 

It is obvious from the form of Eqs. (2.2.11a)-(2.2.12b) that the fields given by these 

formulas satisfy Maxwell's equations.  The integral that appears in Eqs. (2.2.11a) and 

(2.2.11b)  is  proportional  to  the  magnetic  Hertz  vector,  whereas  the  one  in  Eqs. 

                                                                                                                                           
* Although the flaws of such an approximate theory have been known for a long time, it has been used 
recently in the study of focused fields (see Ref. 6, Section 15.4.1) along with another theory39-41 that 
does not satisfy  ∇

(2.2.12a)  and  (2.2.12b)  is  proportional  to  the  electric  Hertz  vector.    Linear 

combinations of Eqs. (2.2.11a) and (2.2.12b) and of Eqs. (2.2.11b) and (2.2.12a) can 

also  be  used  when  both  the  tangential  electric  and  the  tangential  magnetic  fields  at 
z = 0+

 are known exactly. 

Alternatively, instead of Green's functions, an angular spectrum representation 

can be employed, in which case the electric and magnetic fields in the half-space z ≥

(2.2.13b) 

As  in  Section  2.1.3,  u

= (u x,uy ,uz)

  is  a  unit  vector,  the  integration  is  over  all 

u⊥ = (ux ,uy )

 and  u

z  is given by Eqs. (2.1.15a) and (2.1.15b).  Because of Maxwell's 

equations, the (vectorial) angular spectrum amplitudes  e(u⊥)  and  h

(u )⊥

 satisfy the 

relations 

u × e(u⊥ )  = h(u⊥)  , 

u × h(u⊥ )  = – e(u ⊥) , 

u • e(u ⊥)  = 0 , 

u • h(u⊥)  = 0  . 

(2.2.14a) 

(2.2.14b) 

(2.2.14c) 

(2.2.14d) 

Hence,  only  two  of  the  six  components  of  e(u⊥)   and  h(u⊥ )  are  independent  and, 

consequently, Eqs. (2.2.13a) and (2.2.13b) can be rewritten as 
 

 

E(ρ, z)  =

e⊥(u⊥ )  –  ˆ z

(2.2.15b) 

The  vector  e

⊥(u⊥)

  is  the  component  of  e

(u⊥)   transverse  to  the  z-direction,  i.e., 

e⊥(u⊥) = e(u⊥ ) − ˆ z • e(u⊥ )

,  which  is  related  to  the  tangential  electric  field  in  the 

plane

From the Weyl expansion (2.1.18) of a spherical wave and Eq. (2.2.16), it can readily 

be  verified  that  Eqs.  (2.2.15a)  and  (2.2.15b)  are  equivalent  to  Eqs.  (2.2.11a)  and 

(2.2.11b).    It  should  be  mentioned  that  the  angular  spectrum  equivalent  of  Eqs. 

(2.2.12a)  and  (2.2.12b)  is  similar  to  Eqs.  (2.2.15a)  and  (2.2.15b),  except  that  it 

involves h⊥

(u ) = h(u ) − ˆ z • h(u⊥)  instead of e⊥(u⊥) .

2.2.3  Approximate Theories 

Since  the  electromagnetic  aperture  diffraction  problem  is  a  mixed  boundary 

value  problem,  it  is  difficult  to  determine  either  the  electric  field  or  the  magnetic 
field,  or  any  of  their  components,  in  the  plane  z = 0+   for  all  values  of  ρ.    Hence 

approximate theories, similar to those found in the scalar theory (see Section 2.1.5), 

One  commonly  used  theory  is  obtained  by  approximating  the  tangential

This  theory  is  sometimes  known  as  the  m-theory  because  it  involves  an

which  is  sometimes  called  the  Kirchhoff-Kottler  theory  and  which  is  similar  to  the 

usual scalar Kirchhoff theory (2.1.37). 

2.2.4  Two-Dimensional Electromagnetic Diffraction 

If the incident field is a function of only two coordinates, say x and z, and if 

the  aperture  is  a  function  of  only  the x-coordinate, so it is a slit (or several parallel 

slits),  the  electromagnetic  diffraction  problem  is  two  dimensional.1,48    Then,  by 

decomposing the field into E and H-polarizations, 
 

E(x,z) = E (EP x,z) + E (HP x,z)  , 

H(x,z ) = HEP (x, z) + HHP (x,z)  , 

(2.2.22a) 

(2.2.22b) 

the problem may be treated by two independent scalar theories. 

For the E-polarized contribution, the electric field is parallel to the y-axis and 

the magnetic field only has x and z-components, i.e., 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

E EP (x, z) = ˆ y  Ey(x,z)  , 

38 

(2.2.23a) 

HEP (x, z) = ˆ x  Hx (x, z)   + ˆ z  Hz (x,z ) , 

(2.2.23b) 

ˆ x ,  ˆ y   and 

ˆ z 

  being  unit  vectors  in  the  x,  y,  and  z-directions.    Furthermore,  from 

Maxwell’s equations it follows that 

Ey (x, z) satisfies the two-dimensional Helmholtz 

equation, 

(
∇2 +  k2

) Ey (x,z )  =  0  , 

(2.2.24) 

 
∇2 ≡ ∂2 ∂ x2 +∂2 ∂ y2 ,  and  that  the  components  of  the  magnetic  field  can  be 

computed from  Ey (x, z) with the use of the formulas 
 

Hx (x, z)  =  

 ,      Hz(x, z)  =   –

 . 

For a perfectly conducting screen, the boundary conditions (2.2.4) and (2.2.7) in the 

plane z = 0 then reduce to 
 
 

 

Ey (x, z)  = 0
  

∂ Ey (x, z)

(inc) (x,z )

on S  , 

(2.2.26a) 

in A . 

(2.2.26b) 

These boundary conditions are exactly the same as those for a Dirichlet-type screen 

in the scalar theory [see Eqs. (2.1.6) and (2.1.8)]. 

For  the  H-polarized  contribution,  on  the  other  hand,  the  magnetic  field  is 

parallel to the y-axis and the electric field only has x and z-components: 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

HHP (x, z) = ˆ y  Hy(x,z)  

39 

(2.2.27a) 

EHP (x, z) = ˆ x  Ex (x, z)   + ˆ z  Ez(x,z)  . 

(2.2.27b) 

In this case,  Hy(x,z)  obeys the Helmholtz equation, 

(
∇2 +  k2

) Hy(x,z)  =  0 

(2.2.28) 

 
and the formulas 
 

Ex (x,z)  =   –

 ,      Ez(x,z)  =  

(2.2.29) 

i
k

∂Hy (x, z)
∂z

i
k

∂Hy (x, z)
∂x

 

can be used to determine the components of the electric field from  Hy(x,z) .  For a 

perfectly conducting screen, the boundary conditions (2.2.4) and (2.2.7) in the plane 

z = 0 now become identical to those for a Neumann-type screen in the scalar theory 

[see Eqs. (2.1.7) and (2.1.9)]: 

∂ Hy(x,z)
∂ z

 

  

z =0

=  0

on S  , 

(2.2.30a) 

Hy(x,0)  =  Hy
  

(inc) (x,0)

in A

 . 

(2.2.30b) 

Therefore,  two-dimensional  electromagnetic  diffraction  can  be  analyzed  by 

two independent scalar theories.  The scalar theory for E-polarization is based on the 

y-component of the electric field and boundary conditions appropriate to a Dirichlet-

type  screen,  whereas  the  one  for  H-polarization  is  based  on  the y-component of the 

magnetic field and boundary conditions appropriate to a Neumann-type screen.

CHAPTER 3 
 

CONTRIBUTIONS OF HOMOGENEOUS AND 

EVANESCENT WAVES IN THE NEAR-FIELD 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In order to elucidate the effects of diffraction in the near-field, we shall now 

examine  the  separate  contributions  of  homogeneous  and  inhomogeneous  (more 

precisely evanescent) waves to two-dimensional (2-D) near-field diffraction patterns 

of  scalar  fields.    Some  discussion  of  near-field  diffraction  based  on  such  a 

decomposition  can  also  be  found  in  papers  by  Harvey1  and  by  Massey.2    The 

consequences of neglecting evanescent waves in certain near-field distributions have 

been  discussed  by  Carter.3,4    For  the  sake  of  mathematical  simplicity  and  also 

because,  in  the  2-D  case,  the  exact  electromagnetic  diffraction  problem  can  be 

described  by  a  scalar  theory  (see  Section  2.2.4),  we  restrict  our  analysis  to  2-D 

diffraction. 

 

First,  in  Section  3.1  we  discuss  some  basic  relations  for  calculating  the 

homogeneous  and  the  evanescent  contributions  to  an  arbitrary  field.    We  then 

introduce the concepts of total homogeneous intensity and total evanescent intensity 

in  Section  3.2  as  convenient  measures  of  the  relative  importance  of  the  two 

contributions.    In  Section  3.3  we  show  how  to  convert  certain  integrals  used  in 

calculating  the  homogeneous  and  the  evanescent  contributions  into  expressions 

involving  infinite  series  and  in  Section  3.4,  from  some  of  these  expressions,  we 

obtain  approximate  relations  that  are  valid in the near field.  Finally, in Section 3.5 

we examine the case of a plane wave diffracted by a slit in an opaque screen as an 

example.

3.1  HOMOGENEOUS AND EVANESCENT CONTRIBUTIONS 
 

We consider a 2-D monochromatic scalar optical field V(x,z,t) = U(x, z)e−iω t  

that obeys the 2-D Helmholtz equation 

(
∇2 +  k2

) U(x,z)  =  0  , 

(3.1.1) 

 
where  ∇2 ≡ ∂2 ∂ x2 +∂2 ∂ z2  and  k = ω c = 2π λ is the free-space wave number.  

We are interested in free-space propagation of the field U(x,z) from the plane 

z  =  0  into  the  half-space  z  >  0.    We  therefore  assume  that  all  sources,  scatterers, 

diffracting  apertures,  etc.,  are  located  in  the  half-space  z  ≤  0.    Using  the  angular 
spectrum  representation  (see  Section  2.1.3),5-10  we  can  express  U(x, z ≥ 0)   as  the 

sum  of  a  homogeneous  contribution  Uh(x,z)   and  an  evanescent  (inhomogeneous) 

U(x, z) = Uh(x,z) + Ui(x, z) . 

(3.1.2) 

Uh(x,z)  is a superposition of homogeneous plane waves that propagate into the half-

whereas  Ui (x,z) is a superposition of evanescent (inhomogeneous) plane waves that

Ui (x,z)  =

It  should  be  noted  that  the  homogeneous  and  the  evanescent  contributions  each 

separately satisfy the Helmholtz equation. 

As in the 3-D case (see Section 2.2.4), the angular spectrum amplitude  a(u x ) 

is the Fourier transform of the field distribution U(x, 0) in the plane z = 0: 

a(u x )  =

For  the  near-field  geometries  of  interest  here,  we  can  restrict  our  analysis  to  well-

behaved functions  U(x, 0) that are of finite support, i.e., well-behaved functions that 

vanish  outside  some  finite  x-range.    U(x, 0)  is  then  square-integrable;  furthermore, 
a(u x ) is the boundary value on the real ux -axis of an entire analytic function.11

(3.1.9b) 

Because the location of the plane z = 0 is essentially arbitrary, analogous expressions 

must also apply to any plane z = constant ≥ 0: 
 

Uh(x,z)  =  

 
 U( ′ x ,z) d ′ x 

(3.1.10a) 

Ui (x,z)  =  U(x, z)  –  

 U( ′ x ,z ) d ′ x 

 . 

(3.1.10b) 

We see from the preceding discussion that there are three alternative pairs of 

expressions  that  can  be  used  to  determine  the  homogeneous  and  the  evanescent 

contributions to the field in any plane z = constant ≥ 0:  Eqs. (3.1.3a) and (3.1.3b); 

Eqs. (3.1.5a) and (3.1.5b); Eqs. (3.1.10a) and (3.1.10b).   The first pair, Eqs. (3.1.3a) 

and  (3.1.3b),  expresses  Uh(x,z)   and  Ui (x,z)  in  terms  of  the  angular  spectrum 

amplitude  a(u x ), which itself can be computed by taking a Fourier transform of the 

field distribution  U(x, 0) in the plane z = 0 [see Eq. (3.1.4)].  In the near field, these 

equations  are  well  suited  for  numerical  implementation  because  all  the  integrations 

can be performed with fast Fourier transforms. 

 

The second pair of equations, Eqs. (3.1.5a) and (3.1.5b), determines  Uh(x,z)  

and  Ui (x,z) directly from the field distribution  U(x, 0) in the plane z = 0.  However 

 

48 

for  arbitrary  z,  the  kernels 

 H h (x,z )

  and 

 H i(x,z)

,  given  by  Eqs.  (3.1.6a)  and 

(3.1.6b),  cannot  readily  be  expressed  in  closed  form.    Nevertheless,  as  shown  in 

Section  3.3,  the  integral  expressions  (3.1.6a)  and  (3.1.6b)  can  be  converted  into 

expressions that contain infinite series.  Furthermore, as shown in Section 3.4, using 

these  expressions  one  can  obtain  approximate  closed-form  relations  for  both 

 and   

H i(x,z)

  H h (x,z )
 

 that are valid in the near field where kz << 1. 

Lastly,  Eqs.  (3.1.10a)  and  (3.1.10b)  can  be  used  to  determine  Uh(x,z)   and 

Ui (x,z) in any plane z = constant ≥ 0 from knowledge of the field distribution U(x, z) 

in that plane.  If  U(x, z) is not known, but either  Uh(x,z)  or  Ui (x,z) is known, Eqs. 

(3.1.10a) and (3.1.10b) are then Fredholm integral equations of the first and second 

kind, respectively, for the unknown U(x, z).  The integral operator that appears in Eq. 

(3.1.10a) has been studied extensively and occurs in a variety of contexts.13-16 

3.2  TOTAL INTENSITIES 
 

We shall now introduce the concepts of total (plane-integrated) homogeneous 

intensity  and  total  (plane-integrated)  evanescent  intensity  as  rough  convenient 

measures of the relative importance of the contributions  Uh(x,z)  and  Ui (x,z) to the 

field distribution U(x, z). 

Using Eq. (3.1.2), we can write the intensity of the field  I(x,z)  ≡   U(x, z)2  in 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

the form 
 

 

 

where 

and 

I(x,z) = Ih(x, z) + Ii(x,z) + Ihi (x, z) ,

Ih(x, z)  ≡  Uh(x, z)

intensity is just the sum 
 

where 

 

Ii (x, z)  ≡   Ui (x,z)

2

 

49 

(3.2.2b) 

are  the  intensities  of  the  homogeneous  and  of  the  evanescent  contributions, 

respectively, and the term 
 

Ihi (x, z)  ≡  Uh

∗(x,z)Ui (x,z)  +  Uh (x,z )Ui

∗(x, z) 

(3.2.2c) 

arises  from  interference  between  the  two  contributions.    We  now  define  the  total 
(h)(z )  and  the  total  evanescent 

intensity  Itot (z ),  the  total  homogeneous  intensity  Itot
(i) (z ) by the expressions  

(inhomogeneous) intensity  Itot

There are only two terms in Eq. (3.2.5) because the integrated interference term can 

be  shown  to  be  identically  zero.    Furthermore,  as  is  evident  from  Eq.  (3.2.6a),  the 
(h )(z ) is 
(h )(z ) and we will do so 

total homogeneous intensity is conserved on propagation in the sense that  Itot

independent of z.  Hence we may drop the z-argument in  Itot

from now on.  The conservation of total homogeneous intensity on propagation and 

related conservation laws are discussed in Refs. 17-20. 

 

By  substituting  the  angular  spectrum  amplitude  from  Eq.  (3.1.4)  into  Eqs. 
(i) (z ) in terms of 

(3.2.6a) and (3.2.6b), we can rewrite the total intensities  Itot

(3.2.8b) 

Evidently the total intensities  Itot (z ),  Itot

(h )  and  Itot

(i) (z ) are useful only if they 

are  finite  quantities.    In  this  connection,  it  should  be  pointed  out  that  there  are 

physically realistic field distributions that have infinite total intensity but finite total 

energy flux.21  Since the field distribution  U(x, 0) that we are considering is square-

(h )   and  Itot
Itot (z ),  Itot
(h )  <  Itot (0) and  Itot
Itot

integrable [see remarks below Eq.  (3.1.4)],  Itot (0) is finite and, consequently, so are 
(i) (z )  because,  as  can  easily  be  shown,  Itot (z )  ≤  Itot(0) , 
(i) (z) <  Itot (0). 
Instead  of  using  the  total  intensities  Itot

(i) (z )  as  measures  of  the 

(h )   and  Itot

 

relative  importance  of  Uh(x,z)   and  Ui (x,z),  one  might  consider  using  the  total 

energy  flux  Ftot   and  the  total  reactive  energy  Wtot (z )  for  this  purpose.    The  total 

energy  flux  was  already  discussed  in  Section  2.1.6  for  the  3-D  case.    The  total 

reactive  energy  can  be  introduced  in  a  similar  manner  from  the  complex  time-

averaged energy flux vector 

. ˜ F 

For a 2-D scalar field, 

 can be defined by the expression 

˜ F (x, z)

 

˜ F (x, z)  ≡  2iωα U(x,z)∇U∗(x,z)  , 

(3.2.9) 

where α is a real, positive constant and  ∇ = ˆ x ∂ ∂ x + ˆ z ∂∂ z .  Because the real part of 
˜ F 

 is just the real energy flux vector  F  which we encountered in Sections 2.1.6 and 

2.1.7, the total energy flux 

Ftot  across any plane z = constant ≥ 0 may evidently be 

expressed as 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52 

Ftot   =   Re{˜ F (x,z) • ˆ z } dx

 .

Here, since  Ftot  is independent of the propagation distance z,  we have omitted its z-

argument.  The total reactive energy Wtot (z ) across any plane z = constant ≥ 0 may be 

introduced by the analogous expression*  

Wtot (z )  =  

Im{˜ F (x,z) • ˆ z } dx

 . 

(3.2.10b) 

If we use Eqs. (3.1.2)-(3.1.3b) and (3.2.9)-(3.2.10b), we readily find that the 

total energy flux and the total reactive energy may be written in terms of the angular 

spectrum amplitude a(u x ) as 
 

Ftot   =  4πωα

(3.2.11b) 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

These equations should be compared with their counterparts for the total intensities, 

Eqs. (3.2.6a) and (3.2.6b).  It is evident that the total energy flux  Ftot  depends only 

on the homogeneous contribution, whereas the total reactive energy  Wtot (z ) depends 
2  –  1   in  Eq. 

only  on  the  evanescent  one.    Because  of  the  mutiplicative  factor  ux

(3.2.11b),  the  total  reactive  energy  can  diverge  in  cases  when  the  total  evanescent 

                                                                                                                                           
* The electromagnetic analog of this quantity is discussed in Ref. 22. 

53 

intensity  Itot

(i) (z ) is finite.  In fact, for the example considered in Section 3.5, one can 

show that the total reactive energy does indeed diverge in the plane z = 0.  For this 
(i) (z )  rather  than  Ftot   and 

reason,  we  chose  to  use  the  total  intensities  Itot

(h)   and  Itot

Wtot (z ) in our near-field analysis. 

 

 
 

3.3  THE KERNELS H

As was already mentioned in Section 3.1, the kernels 

 H h (x,z )

 and   

H i(x,z)

 

that appear in Eqs. (3.1.5a) and (3.1.5b), and in Eq. (3.2.7b),  and that are defined by 

Eqs. (3.1.6a) and (3.1.6b) cannot be expressed in a closed form.  For analytical and 

numerical  work,  it  is  desirable  to  obtain  alternate  forms  for  H
 

h (x,z )

  and    

H i(x,z)

 

that  do  not  contain  integrals.    In  Sections  3.3.1  and  3.3.2,  we  show  how  to  convert 

Eqs. (3.1.6a) and (3.1.6b) into two different kinds of expressions that contain infinite 

series  of  Bessel  functions  rather  than  integrals.    It  should  be  pointed  out  that  the 

approach used in Section 3.3.2 is somewhat similar to that used in Ref. 7 for the 3-D 

case, but the final results are considerably different.

It is apparent that in the plane z = 0 these equations for

 and   

H i(x,z)

 yield 

the correct limiting forms, Eqs. (3.1.8a) and (3.1.8b), because for z = 0 the only non-

zero term in the summations is the m

= 0 term.

3.4  APPROXIMATE RELATIONS FOR THE NEAR FIELD 
 

 

So far our discussion has been general in the sense that our formulas apply to 

any propagation distance z.  Using the expansions developed in Section 3.3.2 for the 

kernels 

  H h (x,z )

  and    

H i(x,z)

,  Eqs.  (3.3.14a)  and  (3.3.14b),  we  will  now  derive 

approximate relations for the homogeneous and the evanescent contributions that are 

valid for propagation distances much smaller than the wavelength,  0

≤ kz << 1

.  For 

such  distances,  we  would  expect  changes  in  the  field  U

(x, z)  from  its  initial  value 

 

58 

U(x, 0)  to  be  dominated  by  the  decay  of  the  evanescent  contribution  Ui (x,z),  with 

only slight modifications of the homogeneous contribution Uh(x,z) . 

When  0 ≤ kz << , we can approximate Eq. (3.3.14a) for the kernel   

1

H h (x,z )

 

by setting 

x2 +  z2 ≈ x  and retaining only the first two terms in the sum over m:

(3.4.1a) 

For the kernel   
term of Eq.  (3.3.14b), we do not make any approximations to that term.  However, 

x = z = 0  contained in the Y1 

, because there is a singularity at 

H i(x,z)

because  the  Y1  term  also  dominates  the  z-behavior  of 

 H i(x,z)

  in  the  range 

0 ≤ kz << 1

, we only need to keep the first term in the sum over m.  We then obtain 

the approximate formula 

H i(x,z)  ≈ −

It can readily be shown that Eqs. (3.4.1a) and (3.4.1b) reduce to the exact expressions 

(3.1.8a) and (3.1.8b) in the plane z = 0. 

By substituting from Eqs. (3.4.1a) and (3.4.1b) into Eqs. (3.1.5a) and (3.1.5b), 

respectively,  and  making  use  of  Eq.  (3.1.9a),  we  find  that,  for 

0 ≤ kz << 1

homogeneous and the evanescent contributions can be approximated by the formulas

(3.4.2b) 

From  the  form  of  these  two  equations,  we  see  that  for  propagation  distances  much 

smaller than a wavelength the homogeneous contribution is modified from its value 

in  the  plane  z  =  0  by  the  addition  of  a  small  term  that  is  linear  in  kz,  whereas  the 

evanescent  contribution  changes  rapidly  from  its  z  =  0  value.    These  effects  are 

evident in the example considered in the next section. 

 

 
 

3.5  DIFFRACTION BY A SLIT 
 

 

We  now  consider,  as  an  example,  the  near-field  diffraction  of  a  plane  wave 

incident normally on a slit of width d in an planar opaque screen (see Fig. 3-1), using 

approximate  boundary  conditions.    We  assume  that  directly  behind  the  slit,  in  the 

plane 

z = 0+

,  the  field  may  be  approximated  by  the  boundary  conditions  of  the 

Rayleigh-Sommerfeld theory of the first kind, which are given by Eqs. (2.1.31a) and 

(2.1.31b):

(3.5.8) 

We  can  now  examine  the  field  U(x, z),  the  homogeneous  contribution 

Uh(x,z) ,  the  evanescent  contribution  Ui (x,z),  the  total  intensity  Itot (z ),  the  total 
(i) (z ) in the near field 
(h )  and the total evanescent intensity  Itot

homogenous intensity  Itot

for specific values of the slit width d and of the propagation distance z. 

Figures 3-2 through 3-4 depict  U(x,z) ,  Uh(x, z)  and  Ui (x,z) for z = 0, z = 

0.02λ, z = 0.1λ and z = 0.5λ.  These figures were computed from Eqs. (3.5.3a) and 

(3.5.3b) with the use of Fast Fourier Transforms.  Figure 3-2, 3-3 and 3-4 pertain to 

slits of width d = 0.2λ,  d = 1λ and d = 5λ, respectively.  As expected, we see that for 

z << λ changes in the field  U(x, z) from its initial value  U(x, 0) are due mostly the 
decay  of  the  evanescent  contribution  Ui (x,z).    This  decay  of  Ui (x,z)  is  obviously 
most important for the case d = 0.2λ and, consequently, for this slit width there is a 

substantial broadening and decrease in the amplitude of the field distribution  U(x, z) 

on propagation from the plane z = 0 to z = 0.5λ. 

Figures 3-5 through 3-7 show  Itot

(i) (0) as functions of the slit width d 
(i) (z ) as functions of the propagation distance z.  From Fig. 3-5, we 

(h )   and  Itot

and  Itot (z ) and  Itot

see  that  for  slit  widths  smaller  than  about  half  a  wavelength  the  total  evanescent

intensity  Itot

very rapidly with z in all cases, although this decay is much more rapid for the cases 

d = 1λ and d = 5λ than for d = 0.2λ, d = 0.5λ and d = 2.5λ. 

In order to understand the decay of the total evanescent intensity  Itot

(i) (z ) with 

z, we can perform an asympotic expansion of Eq. (3.5.4b) for large kz.  The first three

3.6  CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 

It  is  clear  from  our  analysis  of  the  homogeneous  and  the  evanescent 

contributions, and especially from the example presented in Section 3.5, that changes 

in the field for propagation distances smaller than the wavelength are dominated by 

the  decay  of  the  evanescent  contribution.    Although  we  have  considered  only  two-

dimensional  scalar  fields  in  this  Chapter,  most  of  the  analysis  can  be  extended  to 

three-dimensional scalar fields and to vector fields.

CHAPTER 4 
 

NEAR-FIELD DIFFRACTION OF  

ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES BY A SLIT 

 

So  far  we  have  not  imposed  rigorous  boundary  value  conditions;  in  the 

example  presented  in  Section  3.5,  we  simply  used  the  approximate  boundary 

conditions of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld theory of the first kind.  In order to obtain a 

better  understanding  of  the  structure  of  the  near-field  and  to  develop  more  accurate 

approximate  theories  for  describing  near-field  diffraction,  we  now  reexamine  a 

problem  that  has  been  studied  extensively  in  the  literature  and  that  requires  the 

determination of precise boundary values: the diffraction of a plane wave by a slit in 

a  perfectly  conducting  plane.1-3    Rather  than  summing  the  exact  series  solution, 

which is not an efficient procedure for obtaining the field at many points in space, we 

use the method of finite differences in the time domain to numerically determine the 

near  field.    We  present  numerical  results  for  the  field  in  the  vicinity  of  the  slit  in 

Section  4.1  and  compare  these  results  with  the  predictions  of  the  Rayleigh-

Sommerfeld theories in Section 4.2. 

4.1  NUMERICAL RESULTS 

We  choose  a  coordinate  system  in  which  the  conducting  screen  lies  in  the 

plane z = 0 and the slit (of width d) is parallel to and centered about the y-axis (see

Fig. 4-1).  We assume that the incident field, which illuminates the slit from the half-

space  z  <  0,  is  monochromatic  and  two-dimensional, being a function of  only  the x 

and  z-coordinates.    By  decomposing  the  incident  field  into  E-polarized  and  H-

polarized contributions, this diffraction problem may be analyzed by two independent 

scalar theories (see Section 2.2.4).  For the E-polarized contribution, the electric field 

E EP (x, z) = ˆ y  Ey (x, z)  is  parallel  to  the  slit,  whereas,  for  the  H-polarized  one,  the 

magnetic field HHP (x, z) = ˆ y  Hy (x, z) is parallel to it. 

 

To  determine  the  near  field  accurately,  without  having  to  sum  a  slowly 

converging series or resorting to approximate theories, we used the finite-difference 

time-domain  (FD-TD)  method  described  in  Appendix  E.    In  this  approach,  both 

polarizations  are  treated  by  applying  finite  differences  to  the  free-space  wave 

equation.  The difference between the two polarizations is in the boundary conditions 

that are applied on the surface of the perfect conductor.

We first examined the diffraction of a plane wave by a perfectly conducting 

half-plane  in  order  to  verify  that  our  FD-TD  program  was  working  properly.    We 

present  some  of  those  results  here  because  it  is  instructive  to  contrast  half-plane 

diffraction with slit diffraction.  Figure 4-2 is a color image of the amplitude and the 

phase  of  the  total  electric  field  Ey (x, z)  in  the  vicinity  of  the  half-plane  when  the 

illuminating  field  is  an  E-polarized,  normally  incident,  unit  amplitude,  plane  wave.  

Figure  4-3  is  the  corresponding  image  for  H-polarized  illumination  and  shows  the 

amplitude  and  the  phase  of  the  total  magnetic  field  Hy(x,z) .    To  facilitate  a 

comparison between the FD-TD results and the exact analytical solution depicted in 

Fig. 11.12 of Ref. 4, the amplitude of the magnetic field is shown again as a contour 

plot in Fig. 4-4.  (Note that the orientations of Figs. 4-3 and 4-4 are different.)  Some 

of the numerical errors due to the discretization of the FD-TD method are evident in 

these contours, especially in those of unit amplitude.  However, by comparing Fig. 4-

4  with  the  exact  solution,  we  see  that  this  error  is  small  (<  2%).    In  fact,  it  is  not 

visible in the color images.   

The numerical results for slit diffraction are shown in Figs. 4-5 through 4-17.  

By varying the parameters used in the calculations (see Appendix E), we were able to 

estimate that the error in the amplitude is less than 4 % . 

If  we  examine  the  field  distribution  in  the  half-space  z  <  0,  we  can  readily 

identify the remnants of the standing wave pattern one would expect to see in front of 

a perfectly conducting plane.  Clearly, with increasing slit size, there is less similarity 

between  the  field  distribution  in  the  half-space  z  <  0  and  such  a  standing  wave 

pattern.    Several  edge  dislocations,5,6  where  the  amplitude  is  zero  and  the  phase  is 

therefore not defined, are also visible in this region.  We have labeled these singular 

points only in Fig. 4-8, but they are present in all of the color images.  It should be

behavior.7,8 

pointed out that near dislocations* the Poynting vector exhibits some rather unusual 

Next, if we consider the plane  z = 0+  immediately behind the slit, we see that 

for  E-polarization  (see  Figs.  4-13  and  4-14)  the  electric  field 

Ey (x,0 + )

  has  at  least 

one maximum in the slit and drops to zero at the edge of the slit.  Furthermore, the 

number of maxima increases in a predictable manner as the width of the slit increases.   

For  H-polarization  (see  Figs.  4-15  and  4-16),  the  magnetic  field 

Hy(x,0 + )

  is  very 

nearly a constant in the slit and decreases on the surface of the perfect conductor with 
x .    The  barely  visible  oscillations  of  Hy(x,0 + )  in  the  slit  can  be 
increasing 
attributed to numerical errors, because the magnetic field in the slit must be equal to 

the  incident  magnetic  field  (see  Section  2.2.1).    Although 

zero value in the shadow region, i.e., for 

Hy(x,0 + )
x > d 2, there is obviously no energy flow 

  does  not  have 

through the perfect conductor since the tangential electric field is identically zero on 

the surface. 

z = 0+

In  the  plane 

Ey (x,0 + )  is  obviously  very 
 
,  the  E-polarized  field 
different  from  the  H-polarized  field  Hy(x,0 + ).    However,  after  propagating  a 
distance  of  just  a  few  wavelengths  along  the  z-direction,  Ey (x, z)  and  Hy(x,z)  

explained  by  examining  the  spatial  Fourier  transforms  of

Hy(x,0 + ).  
Hy(x,0 + ) 
are in the higher spatial frequencies†.  Since, in the angular spectrum representation 

One  would  then  notice  that  the  main  differences  between 

Ey (x,0 + )
Ey (x,0 + )

  and 

  and 

(see Section 2.1.3), these higher spatial frequencies give rise either to homogeneous 

                                                                                                                                           
* We examine another type of dislocation, the vortex or screw dislocation, in Chapter 6. 
†  This  type  of  analysis  is  used  in  Ref.  9  to  show  that  the  main  differences  between  the  Rayleigh-
Sommerfeld  theory  of  the  first  kind,  the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theory  of  the  second  kind  and  the 
Kirchhoff theory are also due to high spatial frequencies

plane wave that propagate at a large angle with respect to the z-axis or to evanescent 

plane waves that propagate along the x-axis and decay exponentially along the z-axis, 

Ey (x, z) and  Hy(x,z)  become more similar to each other with increasing z, for fixed 

It is interesting to locate, in the color images, the points where the amplitude 

has a non-zero extremum and to examine the behavior of the phase in the vicinity of 

these  points.    As  expected  from  the  two  theorems  of  Section  2.1.7,  the  surfaces  of 

constant phase are relatively "flat" there.  Furthermore, near maxima of the amplitude 

these  surfaces  are  spaced  further  apart  than  the  corresponding  surfaces  for  a  plane 

wave,  whereas  near  minima  they  are  spaced  closer  together  than  those  for  a  plane 

wave.  This behavior of the phase is particularly noticeable along the z-axis.  As an 

example,  in  Fig.  4-8  we  have  labeled  all  the  points  where  the  amplitude  has  an 

extremum (× = maximum, ○ = non-zero minimum, ● = zero). 

 

 

4.2  COMPARISON OF NUMERICAL RESULTS  WITH  

PREDICTIONS OF APPROXIMATE THEORIES 
 

We  can  now  compare  the  FD-TD  numerical  results  for  the  slit  with  the 

predictions  of  the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theories  of  the  first  and  second  kinds  (see 

Section  2.1.5).    We  will  restrict  this  comparison  to  the  plane  z

= 0+

  immediately 

behind  the  slit  because  that  is  where  we  would  expect  the  greatest  differences 

between the numerical results and the approximate theories.

4.2.1  Predictions of Approximate Theories 

We need to determine the field distribution in the plane z =  0  predicted by 

+

the  approximate  theories  when  the  illuminating  field  is  a  unit  amplitude,  normally 

incident, plane wave, i.e., when 

U(inc) (x,z ) = eikz . 

(4.2.1) 

 
For  the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theory  of  the  first  kind,  the  boundary  value 
U(I )(x,0 + ) of the field is equal to the incident field in the illuminated region and is 

zero in the shadow region.  Therefore,  

U(I )(x,0+ )  =  0

for   x   >

We can now proceed with our comparison.  The FD-TD numerical results for 

the electric field 

 for the case of E-polarized illumination are shown in Figs. 

Ey (x,0 + )

4-13 and 4-14 together with the predictions of the two Rayleigh-Sommerfeld theories, 
U(I )(x,0 + ) and  U(II )(x, 0+ ) .  Figures 4-15 and 4-16 contain the corresponding plots 
for H-polarized illumination.  Because the phase of  U(I )(x,0 + ) in the slit is simply 

equal to zero, it is not shown in Figs. 4-13 through 4-16. 

From  the  plots,  we  see  that  neither  U(I )(x,0 + )  nor  U(II )(x, 0+ )   agree  well 

with  the  numerical  results  for  all  values  of  x.    Nevertheless,  there  is  a  reasonable 

 resembles 
agreement over a certain range of x-values.  For E-polarization, 
U(II )(x, 0+ )   in  the  slit  ( x ≤ d 2)  and  Ey (x,0 + )  =  U(I )(x,0 + )  =  0  in  the  shadow 
region  ( x > d 2).    For  H-polarization,  Hy(x,0 + )  =  U(I )(x,0 + )  =  1  in  the  slit  and 

Ey (x,0 + )

 

96 

Hy(x,0 + )

 resembles  U(II )(x, 0+ )  in the shadow region.  Although the predictions of 

the  usual  Kirchhoff  theory  (see  Section  2.1.5)  are  not  shown  in  these  plots,  it  is 
],  the 
evident  that,  since  for  that  theory  U(K )(x, 0+ )   =  1
agreement  between  U(K )(x, 0+ )   and  the  numerical  results  is  rather  poor  for  all  x-

[
2 U(I) (x,0+ ) + U(II )(x,0+ )

values. 

 

As  was  explained  in  Section  4.2.1,  when  the  width  of  the  slit  is  equal  to  an 

integer  number  of  wavelengths,  i.e.,  when  d = mλ  (m  being  a  positive  integer),  the 
field  distribution  U(II )(x, 0+ )   predicted  by  the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theory  of  the 

second  kind  decays  more  rapidly  into  the  shadow  region.    From  the  figures  for  H-

polarization,  Figs.  4-15  and  4-16,  we  see  that  this  more  rapid  decay  causes  a 
substantial discrepancy between  U (II)(x,0+ )  and  Hy (x,0 + )  for  x > d 2 when d = 
mλ.    However,  since  the  agreement  between  U (II)(x,0+ )   and  Hy (x,0 + )   in  the 
shadow  region  is  excellent  for  d  =  0.2λ,  0.5λ  and  1.5λ,  one  would  expect  a  good 

agreement in that region in general, provided that d ≠ mλ. 

From the preceeding discussion, it is appears that, by modifying the Rayleigh-

Sommerfeld boundary values, we can obtain a much better approximation to the exact 

results 

than 

is  provided  by 

the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld 

theories 

themselves.  

Specifically,  we  can  introduce  two  sets  of  modified  boundary  values  (denoted  by 

superscripts M1 and M2): 

U(M1)(x,0+ ) =  U(I) (x,0+ )

The first set, Eqs. (4.2.14a) and (4.2.14b), should yield a reasonable approximation to 

Ey (x,0 + )

the electric field 

 for E-polarization, whereas the second, Eqs. (4.2.15a) and 
Hy(x,0 + ) 
for  H-polarization.    However,  as  is  evident  from  Figs.  4-13  through  4-16,  the  error 

(4.2.15b),  should  yield  a  reasonable  approximation  to  the  magnetic  field 

between these modified boundary values and the exact results depends on the width 

of the slit and, for certain widths, it can be significant. 

 
One  can  obtain  new  approximate  theories  of  diffraction  by  propagating  the 
boundary values  U(M1)(x,0 + ) and U(M2 )(x, 0+ )  into the half-space z ≥ 0.  Such new 

theories,  and  their  generalizations  for  three-dimensional  electromagnetic  fields,  will 

be discussed in Section 5.1.

CHAPTER 5 
 

NEW METHODS IN APERTURE DIFFRACTION 

In this Chapter, we propose some new approaches for treating diffraction by 

an aperture in a thin screen.  Except for a few preliminary results, these new methods 

are still relatively untested. 

5.1  IMPROVED DIFFRACTION THEORIES FOR THE NEAR FIELD 
 

We first consider two new theories of diffraction that are modifications of the 

scalar  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theories.    These  new  theories  should  provide  better 

approximations  to  near  fields  of  apertures  in  Dirichlet-type  and  in  Neumann-type 

screens*.    We  then  discuss  the  analogous  modifications  of  the  e  and  the  m 

electromagnetic theories of diffraction. 

5.1.1  New Scalar Theories 

We can generalize the modified boundary values  U(M1)  and  U(M2)  that were 

introduced in Section 4.2.2 so that they apply to any field incident from the half-space 

z < 0 and to an aperture of arbitrary shape (see Fig. 2-1 for notation).  In the plane 
z = 0+

  immediately  behind  the  screen,  we  then  have,  instead  of  Eqs.  (4.2.14a)  and 

(4.2.14b),  
                                                                                                                                           
*  As  was  already  mentioned  in  Section  2.1.5,  the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theories  are  often  used  as 
approximations  for  fields  diffracted  by  apertures  in  Dirichlet-type  or  Neumann-type  screens,  even 
though these theories were not originally intended for such screens.

If  we  use  Rayleigh's  first  diffraction  formula  (2.1.10)  to  propagate  the 
modified boundary values  U(M1)(ρ, 0+ ) and  U(M2 )(ρ,0 + ) into the half-space z ≥ 0, 

we obtain the expressions 

  

and

  (5.1.6) 

These are the two new approximate diffraction formulas.  It should be noted that their 

average is equal to the field given by the Kirchhoff theory, i.e.,  
 

[
  U (M1)(ρ, z)  +  U (M2) (ρ,z)

] =  

[
  U(I )(ρ,z)  +  U(II )(ρ, z)

  (5.1.7) 

=  U(K )(ρ,z ) .

It is beyond the scope of this work to examine the full ramifications of these 

new  approximate  scalar  theories  or  to  determine  how  well,  in  general,  their 

predictions  agree  with  exact  results.    Nevertheless,  from  our  discussion  in  Section 
] 
4.2.2, we would expect the first (second) modified theory  U(M1)(ρ, z)  U (M2)(ρ,z)
to provide a reasonable approximation to the field behind a Dirichlet-type (Neumann-

[

type) screen.  Furthermore, the new theories agree with the exact boundary conditions 
over  a  portion  of  the  aperture  plane:    U(II )(ρ,0 + )  =  UD(ρ,0) = 0  
U(M2 )(ρ,0 + )  = UN (ρ,0) = U (inc)(ρ,0)

5.1.2  New Electromagnetic Theories 

We  can  use  an  analogous  approach  to  obtain  two  new  electromagnetic 

theories  of  diffraction  from  the  m  and  e-theories  discussed  in  Section  2.2.3.    These 

new  electromagnetic  theories,  which  we  denote  by  the  superscripts  M1  and  M2, 

should  yield  a  better  approximation  to  the  diffracted  fields  behind  an  aperture  in  a 

perfectly conducting screen.

One of the major inadequacies of the e-theory is that it gives a non-zero value 

for  the  tangential  electric  field  on  the  surface  of  the  perfect  conductor.    We  can 

remedy this deficiency by introducing the modified boundary values 
 
 

  ˆ z × E(M1) (ρ,0+ )  =  0

on S  

 

(5.1.8a) 

  ˆ z × E(M1) (ρ,0+ )  =  ˆ z × E(e)(ρ,0+ )

in A , 

(5.1.8b) 

 
where E(e)(ρ,0 + ) is the boundary value of the electric field in the e-theory,

We  can  now  apply  Eqs.  (2.2.11a)  and  (2.2.11b)  to  determine  the  electric  and 

magnetic fields predicted by the first modified theory for the half-space z ≥ 0.  They

It is possible to improve the m-theory in a similar manner by setting the x and 

y-components  of  the  magnetic  field  in  the  aperture  equal  to  their  correct  values, 

namely, equal to those of the incident magnetic field (see Section 2.2.1),

the m-theory,

Even  though  both  of  the  new  electromagnetic  diffraction  theories  satisfy 

Maxwell's  equation,  they  obviously  give  very  different  predictions  for  the  fields 

transmitted through an aperture in a perfectly conducting screen.  It is still neccessary 

to determine which one of the two theories is better and under what conditions. 

104 

 

 

It  should  be  pointed  out  that  for  both  scalar  and  electromagnetic  fields  the 

new  theories  are  more  difficult  to  employ  than  the  usual  approximate  theories 

because  they  require  additional  integrations.    A  comparison  with  exact  results  for 

several  different  cases  is  therefore  still  needed  in  order  to  decide  whether  the 

additional computation efforts are warranted. 

 

 
 

5.2  ITERATIVE FOURIER-BASED ALGORITHM 
FOR APERTURE DIFFRACTION 
 

 

We  will  now  describe  a  new  algorithm  for  solving  rigorous  diffraction 

problems  that  involve  apertures  in  infinitely  thin  screens*.    For  these  types  of 

problems, this algorithm requires far less computer time and memory than the finite-

difference time-domain method (for references see Appendix E), and also has some 

advantages  over  the  method  of  moments2,3  because  it  does  not  require  matrix 

inversion.    It  can  be  implemented  very  effectively  with  fast  Fourier  transforms 

(FFT's). 

 

When the angular spectrum representation is used to analyze rigorous aperture 

diffraction,  the  mixed  boundary  value  problem  is  posed  in  terms  of  dual  integral 

equations  for  the  angular  spectrum  amplitude  of  the  transmitted  field.    The  new 

algorithm  is  an  iterative  solution  of  such  integral  equations  which  bears  some 

resemblance  to  the  iterative  algorithms  used  in  phase  retrieval.4-7    Here,  we  will 

discuss its implementation for scalar fields diffracted by apertures in either Dirichlet-

type or Neumann-type screens, and for electromagnetic fields diffracted by apertures 

                                                                                                                                           
* After this work was completed, the author became aware of a related approach for solving diffraction 
and scattering problems (see Ref. 1 and references therein).  However, that approach does not involve 
the same integral equations as the one described here. 

 

105 

in  perfectly  conducting  screens.    It  may  be  possible  to  adapt  the  algorithm  to  other 

situations as well. 

5.2.1  Dual Scalar Integral Equations 

We begin by deriving the dual integral equations8-13 for scalar fields.  It will 

become apparent later that, in fact, these integral equations can be written down by 

inspection  with  the  help  of  Eqs.  (2.1.8)  and  (2.1.9).    Nevertheless,  the  derivation  is 

instructive because it shows how to compute the reflected field once the transmitted 

field has been determined, and because it provides a proof of Eqs. (2.1.8) and (2.1.9). 

Let  us  use  the  angular  spectrum  representation  (see  Section  2.1.3)  for  the 

 

 

 

 

 

incident and the reflected fields in the half-space z ≤ 0, 
 

U(inc) (ρ,z)  =   a(inc)(u⊥ ) 
∫

eiku⊥• ρ eikuz z d2u⊥  , 

U(rfl)(ρ,z )  =   a(rfl)(u⊥ ) 
∫

and for the transmitted field in the half-space z ≥ 0,

2
uz  =   1  −  u⊥

for  u⊥ ≤  1 , 

uz  =  i u⊥

2  −  1

 for  u⊥ >  1 . 

 
The continuity conditions (2.1.4) and (2.1.5) require that 
 

  U(inc) (ρ,0− )  +  U(rfl)(ρ,0 − )  =  U (trn)(ρ,0+ )

Therefore,  in  the  aperture,  the  following  integral  relations  must  be  fulfilled  by  the

(a) Dirichlet-Type Screen 

On the surface of a Dirichlet-type screen, since the field is equal to zero, the 

angular spectrum amplitudes must also satisfy the relations

eiku⊥•ρ d 2u⊥ =  0

If we add Eq. (5.2.7) to the left-hand side of Eq. (5.2.5), add Eq. (5.2.8) to the right-

hand  side  and  take  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  resulting  equation,  we  find  that  the 

angular  spectum  amplitude  of  the  reflected  field  can  be  obtained  directly  from  the 

angular  spectrum  amplitudes  of  the  incident  and  the  transmitted  fields  using  the

The first of these equations ensures that the transmitted field is zero on the screen and 

the second that the z-derivative of the transmitted field in the aperture is equal to the 

z-derivative of the incident field.  The second equation is therefore equivalent to Eq. 

(2.1.8).

On  a  Neumann-type  screen,  since  the  normal  derivative  of  the  field  is

(5.2.12) 

 
From  these  relations  and  Eq.  (5.2.6),  we  find  that  a(rfl) (u⊥)   is  now  related  to 
a(inc)(u⊥ )
 
 

a(rfl)(u⊥)  =  a (inc)(u⊥)  −  a(trn)(u⊥)

5.2.2  Iterative Fourier-Based Algorithm for Scalar Fields 

 
An iterative approach for solving both Eq. (5.2.10) and Eq. (5.2.14) becomes 
evident from the Fourier transform relations between the field in the plane  z = 0+  and 
the angular spectrum amplitude a(trn)(u ⊥) (see Section 2.1.3),

(5.2.17) 

 
The iterative algorithm then consists of the following steps: 
 

0)  Assume  initially  that  Uz

(0)(ρ)  is  given  by  the  boundary  values  of  the 

Rayleigh-Sommerfeld theory of the second kind (RS II). 

1)  Use Eq. (5.2.16b) to calculate the angular spectrum amplitude a(trn)(u ⊥).

2)  Use Eq. (5.2.15a) to calculate  U

 is prescribed, set it equal to that value.

(0)(ρ).  Over the portion of the aperture 
(0)(ρ) is prescribed, set it equal to that value.  

The necessary calculations for Dirichlet-type screens are shown explicitly in Fig. 5-1 

and  those  for  Neumann-type  screens  in  Fig.  5-2.    All  the  integrations  can  be 
(0)(ρ)

performed  with  FFT's.    The  algorithm  can  also  be  started  at  step  #3  with  U

 

given  by  the  boundary  values  of  the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theory  of  the  first  kind 

(RS I).  Other initial values of  U

 can also be used.  The ones just 

(0)(ρ) or  U
z

(0)(ρ)

mentioned are the simplest. 

The  preceding  steps  do  not  guarantee  the  correct  result  since,  without  edge 

conditions,  the  rigorous  diffraction  problem  does  not  necessarily  have  a  unique 

solution  (see  Section  2.1.1).    However,  it  is  relatively  simple  to  introduce  a  small 

"loss" into the algorithm so that the solution that obeys edge conditions is chosen.

This  loss  can  be,  for  example,  a  weakly  attenuating  filter  applied  to  the  angular

several different results without ever converging.  Nevertheless, the numerical results 

presented  in  the  next  section  suggest  that,  in  fact,  the  algorithm  converges  to  the 

correct solution very rapidly. 

 

It should be pointed out that step #1 of the algorithm could create difficulties 

because there is a singularity present on the circle u⊥ = 1 (uz = 0 ).  If the algorithm is 

implemented with FFT's, the singularity can be avoided by choosing the values of u⊥  

where a

(trn)(u ⊥)

 is sampled so that they are not too close to u

⊥ = 1.

Let  us  examine  step  #2  of  the  first  iteration  through  the  algorithm  when  the 

starting  values  are  the  boundary  values  of  the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theory  of  the 

second kind.  For a Dirchlet-type screen (see Fig. 5-1), the field U

 at this step is 
(M1)(ρ, 0+ ) of the first modified theory of 

(0)(ρ)

simply equal to the aperture plane field  U

Section  5.1.1  and,  for  a  Neumann-type  screen  (see  Fig.  5-2),  it  is  equal  to  the  field 
U(M2 )(ρ,0 + ) of the second modified theory.  Therefore, these modified theories can 

be  viewed  as  the  first  in  a  series  of  iterative  improvements  to  the  Rayleigh-

Sommerfeld theory of the second kind. 

5.2.3  Numerical Results 

In order to test the new algorithm, we applied it to the simple two-dimensional 

diffraction  problem  considered  in  Chapters  3  and  4:  a  slit  illuminated  by  a  unit 

amplitude,  normally 

incident,  plane  wave. 

  The  necessary  one-dimensional 

integrations were all performed with FFT's and a weak exponential filter of the form 

}
  was  applied  to  a
exp −  0.1  (u⊥ −   25)

{

(trn)

  for  u

⊥ > 25.    The  numerical  results  for 

slits of width d = 0.5λ and d = 2λ in a Dirichlet-type screen are shown in Fig. 5-3.  

By comparing these plots with the corresponding plots in Figs. 4-13 and 4-14, we see 

that  the  algorithm  does  produce  the  correct  solution.    In  fact,  it  converges  to  this 

solution very  rapidly. 

5.2.4  Dual Integral Equations and the Iterative Fourier-Based Algorithm for  

Electromagnetic Fields 

To  obtain  the  dual  electromagnetic  integral  equations,  we  use  an  approach 

similar to that for scalar fields.  We represent the incident, reflected and transmitted 

electric fields by angular spectra of plane waves (see Section 2.2.2):

The iterative Fourier-based algorithm for solving Eq. (5.2.30) is similar to the 

scalar version, but it is considerably more complicated (see Fig. 5-4).  In order to pick 

out  the  one  solution  that  satisfies  edge  conditions,  a  weakly  attenuating  filter  can 
(trn) (u⊥)
h⊥

again  be  applied  to  the  angular  spectrum  amplitudes  e

(trn)(u⊥)

  and 

⊥

  

However, unlike the scalar case, the correct solution to the electromagnetic aperture 

 

118 

diffraction problem does contain singularities.  Fortunately, that solution is the least 

singular one so it is still favored by the attenuating filter. 

As  indicated  in  Fig.  5-4,  the  algorithm  can  be  initiated  with  the  e-theory  at 

step #1 or with the m-theory at step #4.  It can readily be shown that, if the e-theory is 

used  to  start  the  algorithm,  then  in  the  first  iteration  the  transverse  electric  field 

(0)(ρ)
E ⊥

  at  step  #3  is  equal  to  the  transverse  vector  component  of  aperture  plane 
( M1)(ρ,0+ )  of the first modified electromagnetic theory.  On the other 

electric field  E

hand,  if  the  m-theory  is  used,  then  at  step  #6  of  the  first  iteration  the  transverse 

(0 )(ρ)
magnetic  field  H
⊥
H(M2) (ρ,0+ )   of 

  is  equal  to  the  transverse  component  of  the  magnetic  field 

the  second  modified 

theory. 

  Hence 

the 

two  modified 

electromagnetic theories are first order improvements to the e and the m-theories.

CHAPTER 6 
 

OPTICAL VORTICES AND THEIR 

EFFECTS ON DIFFRACTION 

 

The study of dislocations in an optical field, where the amplitude is zero and, 

consequently, the phase is not defined, provides an interesting insight into diffraction.  

Ever  since  the  seminal  work  of  Nye  and  Berry  on  these  fine  structures  of 

wavefields,1-4  there  has  been  a  considerable  effort  to  understand  their  occurrence 

under various conditions.5-16  We have already encountered edge dislocations in the 

two-dimensional  diffraction  patterns  of  Chapter  4.    We  now  turn  our  attention  to 

optical vortices (screw dislocations).  For these types of dislocations, which can only 

appear in three-dimensional diffraction, the surfaces of constant phase are of the form 

of spiral staircases.  We begin with a brief discussion of the vortices present in Bessel 

beams and then examine a specific situation where a vortex dramatically affects the 

diffraction of a field. 

6.1  VORTICES IN BESSEL BEAMS 
 

In a plane z = constant, the field in the vicinity of an optical vortex that lies 

along the z-axis can be expressed as 

 

U(ρ,ϕ,z)  =  C ρ| m| eimϕ , 

(6.1.1) 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

121 

where ρ= x2 +  y2 , cosϕ= x ρ, sinϕ= y ρ and m is an integer, sometimes called 

the strength (or charge) of the vortex.  Hence an mth-order Bessel beam propagating 

into the half-space z > 0, which is of the form (see Section 2.1.4) 

(m)(ρ,ϕ,z)  =  Jm (ku⊥ρ) eimϕ eikuz z , 

Bu⊥
  

(6.1.2) 

possesses  a  vortex  of  strength  m  along  the  z-axis,  since  for  small  arguments  the 

Bessel function can be approximated by17

as β→ 0 .

This applies both to nondiffracting Bessel beams, for which

and to evanescent ones, for which

u⊥ >  1 . 

(6.1.4a) 

It  is  instructive  to  examine  the  behavior  of  the  energy  flux  vector  F  

associated with these two types of Bessel beams.  As discussed in Section 2.1.7,  F  

may be written in the form 
 
 

 

F  =  2ωα A2∇φ

 , 

(6.1.5) 

where 

A

 is the amplitude of the field and 

φ is its phase.  It follows that

respectively,  for  nondiffracting  and  for  evanescent  Bessel  beams, 

ˆ ϕ

   being  a  unit 

vector  in  the  azimuthal  direction.    From  this  pair  of  expressions,  we  see  that  in 

nondiffracting Bessel beams the flow lines of the energy flux vector are spirals about 

the z-axis that are right (left) handed for positive (negative) m, whereas in evanescent 

Bessel beams they are concentric circles that decrease exponentially in number as z 

increases.  These two cases are illustrated in Figs. 6-1 and 6-2. 

 
 

6.2  SPIRAL PHASE PLATE ILLUMINATED BY A GAUSSIAN BEAM 
 

 

To illustrate the dramatic effect that the presence of a vortex can have on the 

diffraction  of  a  field,  we  now  examine  the  field  emerging  from  an  mth-order  spiral 
phase  plate,  with  transmission  function  tm(ϕ) = eimϕ,  when  the  plate  is  illuminated 
by a Gaussian beam.  This specific situation, and its generalization to illumination by 

a  Laguerre-Gaussian  beam,  has  already  been  examined  in  Ref.  18  by  means  of  a 

decomposition  of  the  output  field  in  the  complete  set  of  Laguerre-Gaussian  beams.  

However,  explicit  results  were  presented  only  for  the  far  field.    Here  we  wish  to 

understand how the vortex along the z-axis affects the field as it propagates from near 

zone to far zone.  Instead of using a mode decomposition, we will show that there is a 

relatively  simple  closed-form  expression  for  the  output  field.    Since  the  input 

Gaussian beam is paraxial, the output is also paraxial* and, consequently, evanescent 

waves play no role in this situation. 

                                                                                                                                           
* From Eq. (6.2.4) it is apparent that the output beam is paraxial if the condition  kw
 is satisfied, 
which is precisely the requirement for the input beam to be paraxial.

So  that  the  phase  of  the  field  emerging  from  the  spiral  phase  plate  is  a 

continuous function of the angle ϕ, and so that there is only a single dislocation in 

the field, we take m to be an integer.  This also ensures that the amplitude of the field 

is rotationally symmetric.  In practice, the transmission function tm(ϕ) of the phase

plate  can  be  obtained  from  a  transparent  plate  of  uniform  refractive  index  with 

thickness that varies appropriately with ϕ, or from one of constant thickness with the 

correct  refractive  index  profile.    The  first  approach  was  used  in  the  experimental 

work described in Ref. 18. 

For  simplicity,  we  assume  that  the  waist  of  the  illuminating  beam  coincides 

with  the  plane 

z = 0−

,  which  is  the  location  of  the  phase  plate  (see  Fig.  6-3).    The 

field in the plane 

 behind the plate is then given by the expression

We can use the Bessel-beam representation, in the paraxial approximation, to 

propagate the field given by Eq. (6.2.1).  The field in the half-space z > 0 is then of 

the form (see Section 2.1.4)

From  Eq.  (6.2.4),  we  see  that  the  beam  Um (ρ,ϕ, z)  contains  only  mth-order  Bessel 

beams.  If we substitute from Eqs. (6.2.3) and (6.2.4) into Eq. (6.2.2) and make the

(6.2.17) 

If m is an even integer, the modified Bessel functions in Eq. (6.2.17) can be expressed 

explicitly  in  terms  of  hyperbolic  sines  and  cosines.    When  m  =  0,  since  there  is  no 

phase  plate,  Eq.  (6.2.13)  should  reduce  to  the  expression  for  an  ordinary  Gaussian 

beam  and,  therefore,  the  modifying  function  M0(ρ,ϕ,z)  should  be  equal  to  unity.  

With the help of the expressions [see Ref. 17, pg. 443, Eqs. (10.2.13) and (10.2.14)]

(6.2.18a) 

(6.2.18b) 

it is straightforward to verify that indeed  M0(ρ,ϕ,z) = 1. 

Let us examine the behavior of the beam  Um (ρ,ϕ, z) near the z-axis.  For this 

purpose, we make use of the limiting form [see Ref. 17, pg. 375, Eq. (9.6.7)]

the field Um (ρ,ϕ, z) are

We see that an mth-order spiral phase plate causes a vortex of strength m,  ρ| m|eimϕ, 

(6.2.21) 

 

to appear in the field along the z-axis.  It is apparent that, for  m ≠ 0, the rapidity with 

which  the  field  changes  from  its  zero  on  axis  value  depends  on  the  propagation 

distance.  For distances z much smaller than the Rayleigh range, we can approximate 

Eq. (6.2.21) by the expression 
 

Um (ρ,ϕ, z)  ≈  A

Hence, near the z-axis, the closer one approaches the plane  z = 0+ , the more rapidly 

(6.2.22) 

 

the  field  increases  radially  from  zero.    This  is  to  be  expected  since,  in  the  limit 
z → 0+

, the field must be non-zero on the z-axis [see Eq. (6.2.1)]. 

Figures  6-4  and  6-5  depict  the  behavior  of  the  beam  Um (ρ,ϕ, z)  and  of  the 

modifying  function  Mm(ρ,ϕ,z)   in  the  half-space  z  >  0  for  m  =  1  and  m  =  2.    For 

comparison,  an  ordinary  Gaussian  beam  U0(ρ,ϕ, z)  is  also  shown  in  these  figures.  

As we would anticipate from our preceding discussion, the width of the hole in the 

center of the beams U1(ρ,ϕ, z) and U (2 ρ,ϕ,z ) increases with increasing z.

There are two somewhat surprising aspects of Figs. 6-4 and 6-5:  (i) that for 

propagation  distances  much  smaller  than  the  Rayleigh  range  the  amplitudes  of 

U1(ρ,ϕ, z)  and  of  U2(ρ,ϕ,z )  do  change  considerably  on  propagation,  even  though 

the  amplitude  of  an  ordinary  Gaussian  beam  is  nearly  invariant  over  such  distances 

and  (ii)  that  there  are  high  frequency  radial  oscillations  present  in  U1(ρ,ϕ,z)   and 

U2(ρ,ϕ, z)   for  z = 0.005zr   and  z = 0.05zr .    These  oscillations  become  even  more 

pronounced for larger m, but they disappear almost completely once the propagation 

distance is of the order of the Rayleigh range.  Although the analysis here applies to 

the  specific  case  of  a  spiral  phase  plate  illuminated  by  a  Gaussian  beam,  we  would 

expect to observe similar effects for illumination by an arbitrary vortex-free coherent 

beam.

CHAPTER 7 
 

SUMMARY 

The primary objective of this thesis was to study the effects of diffraction of 

light  in  the  near  zone  of  apertures  in  thin  opaque  screens,  with  dimensions 

comparable  to  the  wavelength.    For  this  purpose,  in  addition  to  making  use  of 

standard  techniques,  several  new  analytical  and  numerical  tools  were  developed 

specifically for examining the near field. 

In Chapter 2, it was shown that for a scalar field near a point in space where 

the amplitude has a local extremum the surfaces of constant phase are relatively flat.  

Furthermore, if the extremum is a maximum, these surfaces are spaced further apart 

than the corresponding surfaces for a plane wave, whereas if it is a minimum, they are 

spaced closer together than those for a plane wave.  In Chapter 4, this type of phase 

behavior  was  demonstrated  explicitly  for  the  near-field  of  a  slit  in  a  perfectly 

conducting plane.  However, these properties apply to any scalar field in free space 

and, therefore, they can applied to understand various phase phenomena that occur in 

the  vicinity  of  extrema  of  the  amplitude,  such  as  the  phase  anomaly  present  near 

focus. 

 

In  order  to  understand  the  propagation  of  a  field  in  the  near  zone,  the 

contributions  of  homogeneous  and  of  evanescent  waves  to  the  total  field  were 

examined in Chapter 3 for the case of a two-dimensional scalar field.  Several exact 

techniques  for  calculating  these  two  contributions  were  discussed  and  approximate 

 

 

135 

relations  were  derived  for  the  near  field.    The  concepts  of  total  homogeneous 

intensity  and  total  evanescent  intensity  were  introduced  as  convenient  measures  of 

the relative importance of the two contributions.  As an example, the diffraction of a 

plane  wave  by  a  slit  was  examined  with  the  use  of  the  approximate  boundary 

conditions  of  the  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  theory  of  the  first  kind.    Even  though  these 

boundary conditions provide a poor approximation to the exact near field, they can be 

used  to  obtain  insight  into  the  behavior  of  the  homogeneous  and  the  evanescent 

contributions on propagation.  As one would expect, near-zone modifications of field 

are dominated by the decay of the evanescent contribution, with only relatively small 

changes of the homogeneous contribution. 

 

In Chapter 4, the finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method was used to 

reexamine  the  slit  diffraction  problem  rigorously  for  the  case  of  a  thin  perfectly 

conducting screen, without making use of any approximate boundary conditions.  The 

near-fields for both E and H-polarizations were considered in detail.  A comparison 

of the boundary fields obtained from the FD-TD method with the predictions of the 

Rayleigh-Sommerfeld theory of the first kind and of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld theory 

of  the  second  kind  showed  that  neither  approximate  theory  gives  an  accurate 

description  of  the  near  field.    The  discrepancy  between  the  exact  solution  and  the 

predictions  of  the  approximate  theories  decreases,  however,  with  increasing 

propagation  distance.    Futhermore,  it  was  shown  that,  by  modifying  the  boundary 

values of the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld theories, it is possible to obtain two new theories 

of diffraction that provide a better approximation to the near field.  One of these new 

theories yields a reasonable approximation to the electric field for E-polarization and 

the  other  to  the  magnetic  field  for  H-polarization.    Generalizations  of  the  new 

approximate  theories  to  arbitrary  aperture  shapes  were  discussed  in  Chapter  5.  

Because  the  new  theories  are  more  difficult  to  employ  than  the  usual  approximate 

 

 

 

136 

theories, further work is still needed to determine whether the additional computation 

efforts required by the new theories are worthwhile. 

An iterative Fourier-based algorithm for treating diffraction by an aperture of 

arbitrary  shape  in  a  thin  opaque  screen  was  proposed  in  chapter  5.    This  new 

algorithm,  which  is  based  on  the  angular  spectrum  representation,  can  be 

implemented  with  the  use  of  fast  Fourier  transforms  for  scalar  fields  incident  upon 

apertures  in  Dirichlet-type  or  Neumann-type  screens  and  for  electromagnetic  fields 

incident  upon  apertures  in  perfectly  conducting  screens.    For  these  situations,  the 

algorithm  appears  to  be  much  more  efficient  than  the  FD-TD  method.    Preliminary 

results for the case of slit diffraction indicate that the algorithm converges to the exact 

solution very rapidly. 

 

In  Chapter  6,  in  order  to  show  that  an  optical  vortex  can  dramatically  affect 

the diffraction of a three-dimensional field over small propagation distances, the field 

emerging  from  a  spiral  phase  plate  illuminated  by  a  Gaussian  beam  was  examined.  

For  this  example,  a  closed-form  solution  for  the  field  behind  the  phase  plate  was 

found in terms of modified Bessel functions with complex argument.  It was shown 

that there are appreciably changes to the field for propagation distances much smaller 

than  the  Rayleigh  range.      Hence,  even  though,  strictly  speaking,  the  propagation 

distances  in  question  are  not  in  the  near  zone  because  they  are  larger  than  the 

wavelength, they are considerably smaller than minimum distance usually associated 

with  observable  diffraction  effects  in  beams.    One  would  expect  to  see  similar 

behavior  in  other  situations  in  which  an  optical  vortex  is  imposed  on  a  previously 

vortex-free field. 

 

In  conclusion,  it  should  be  stressed  that,  in  general,  for  apertures  with 

dimensions comparable to the wavelength or smaller, near-field diffraction is difficult 

to  analyze  because  the  usual  approximations  used  in  physical  optics  for  the 

 

 

137 

propagator  (the  Green's  function)  and  for  the  boundary  values  of  the  field  are  not 

applicable.    Both  the  boundary  value  problem,  which  requires  the  determination  of 

the  boundary  value  of  the  field  immediately behind the screen, and the propagation 

problem,  which  requires  the  determination  of  the  field  at  some  distance  from  the 

screen from this boundary field, must be treated carefully.

SOME REMARKS ON THE POYNTING 

VECTOR AND ENERGY DENSITY  

 

 

 

 

 

In Section 2.1.7, it was shown that, for a complex scalar field  U = A eiφ, the 

(real) energy flux vector F is related to the amplitude A and the phase φ by the simple 

expression 
 
 

 

F  =  2ωα A2∇φ

 , 

(A.1) 

where  α  is  a  real,  positive  constant.    In  this  Appendix,  we  derive  the  analogous 

relation for an electromagnetic field and show that it reduces to the form of Eq. (A.1) 

when the field is linearly polarized. 

The  (real)  time-averaged  Poynting  vector  associated  with  a  monochromatic 

electromagnetic field with electric field E and magnetic field H is given by  
 

S =  

  Re{E × H∗}

139 

Let  us  express  the  electric  field  E  in  terms  of  its  magnitude  E  and  a  (complex) 

polarization unit vector u , e
 
 
 
 

 

 

Then, 
 

E × (∇ × E∗) =  E ue × [∇ × (E ue

∗)]

E = E ue  , 

E  =   E  ,     ue • ue

∗  =  1 .

and, because ∇

 , 

 

ue • ∇E = − E ∇ • ue  . 

(A.4) 

(A.5) 

(A.6) 

(A.7) 

By making use of Eqs. (A.2), (A.6) and (A.7), we readily obtain the desired 

expression for the Poynting vector, 
 

where  

S  =   −

 we  Im{ue × (∇ × ue

(A.9) 

is  the  electric  energy  density.    Equation  (A.8)  should  be  compared  with  Eq.  (A.1).  

Similarly to Eq. (A.1), where the direction of energy flux vector F depends only on 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 
Hence 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

140 

the phase φ, in Eq. (A.8) the direction of the Poynting vector S depends only on the 

polarization unit vector u . e

We  next  consider  the  case  when  the  electric  field  is  linearly  polarized.  

Although this case is discussed extensively in Ref. 1, we reexamine it here to show 

that Eq. (A.8) does yield the correct result.   

For a linearly polarized electric field, the complex unit polarization vector  u  
e

may be written in terms of a real polarization unit vector n  and a real phase 

e

ue  =  ne eiφe  . 

φe  as 

(A.10) 

ue × (∇ × ue

∗) =  eiφe  ne × [∇ × (ne e−iφe )]

=  ne × (∇ × ne)  −  ine × (∇φe × ne )
=  ne × (∇ × ne)  −  i∇φe  +  ine(ne • ∇φe ) ,

 

(A.11) 

∗(∇ • ue ) =  ne e−iφe[∇ • (ne eiφe )]
ue

=  ne (∇ • ne )  +  ine(ne • ∇φe ) 

 

(A.12) 

 
and Eq. (A.8) becomes 
 

S  =  

 we [∇φe  −  2 ne(ne • ∇φe)] . 

(A.13) 

c
k

If we now substitute from Eq. (A.10) into Eq. (A.7), we obtain the relation 
 

ne • ∇E = − E ∇ • ne − iE ne • ∇φe  . 

(A.14) 

By taking the imaginary part of this expression, 
 

ne • ∇φe = 0 , 

(A.15) 

141 

 

e

we  find  that  the  polarization  unit  vector  n   is  perpendicular  to  the  surfaces  of 

constant 

φe .  Equation (A.13) then reduces to the form of Eq. (A.1),  

S  =

c

(A.16) 

in agreement with Eq. (3.22) of Ref. 1. 

It  should  be  mentioned  that,  by  writing  the  magnetic  field  H  in  a  form 

analogous to Eq. (A.4), 
 

H  =  H um  ,      H  =   H  ,     um • um

∗   =  1, 

(A.17) 

we can obtain an expression for the Poynting vector that is equivalent to Eq. (A.8), 

but  which  is  in  terms  of  the  magnetic  energy  density  w   and  the  (complex)

polarization unit vector u :

DERIVATION OF ASYMPTOTIC SERIES (3.5.9) 

FOR THE TOTAL EVANESCENT INTENSITY 

To  understand  the  decay  of  the  total  evanescent  intensity  Itot

(i) (z )  for  the 

example  considered  in  Section  3.5,  we  need  to  derive  the  first  few  terms  in  the 

asymptotic expansion, for large values of kz, of Eq. (3.5.4b), i.e., of

DESCRIPTION OF THE FD-TD NUMERICAL METHOD 

In  this  Appendix,  we  describe  the  finite-difference  time-domain  (FD-TD) 

technique that we implemented to obtain the numerical results presented in Chapter 4.   

Although  the  specific  FD-TD  method  we  used  is  rather  unsophisticated,  it  does 

provide very accurate results.  Because there exists extensive literature on FD-TD,1-3 

we shall keep our discussion rather brief. 

Since  both  E  and  H-polarizations  can  be  completely  described  by  a  scalar 

field  that  satisfies  the  free-space  Helmholtz  equation,  in  the  time  domain  the  two 

polarizations  can  be  treated  by  applying  finite  differences  to  the  free-space  wave

⎞ 
⎟  V (x, z,t)  =  0 . 
⎠ 

(E.1) 

For a rectangular grid of points (see Fig. E-1), the discritized wave equation for the 

scalar field V(x,z,t) can then be expressed in the form 

  V

 

(x,z,t + ∆t)  =  c2 (∆t) 2 ∇2V (x, z,t)  +  2V (x, z,t)  –  V(x, z,t – ∆t)
 

 ,

(E.4) 

Here  ∆x << λ  and  ∆z << λ  are  small  increments  along  x  and  z  directions, 

respectively, and  ∆  is a small increment of time.  To obtain stable results,  ∆  must

satisfy the causality inequality

(E.5)

From  Eqs.  (E.2)-(E.4),  V(x,z,t + ∆t)  can  be  computed  from  V(x,z,t)  and 

V(x,z,t – ∆t).    This  procedure  can  be  invoked  repeatedly  to  determine  the  field 

V(x,z,T ) at some time of interest T = to + n(∆t) , n being an integer, from knowledge 

of V(x,z,to)  and V(x,z,to – ∆t)  at some initial time t . o

  The  difference  between  the  treatment  of  the  two  polarizations  is  in  the 

boundary  conditions  for  V(x,z,t)  on  the  surface  of  the  perfect  conductor.    For  E-

polarization, since V represents the electric field  Ey , V must satisfy the condition 
 

 

V(x,0,t)  =  0

for   x   >  

 , 

(E.6) 

d

and for H-polarization, since V represents the magnetic field  Hy , it must satisfy 

V(x,−∆z,t)  =  V(x,0,t)    and   V(x,∆z,t)  =  V(x,2∆z,t)

for   x   >  

 . 

 

d

(E.7) 

Equations  (E.6)  and  (E.7)  ensure  that  the  tangential  electric  field  is  zero  on  the 

conductor. 

The  above  scheme  was  applied  to  the  total  field  with  the  use  of  three  two-

dimensional  arrays  to  store  V(x,z,t + ∆t),  V(x,z,t)  and  V(x,z,t – ∆t)  at  the  grid 

points.  The slit plane was placed near the center of the grid and the incident plane 

wave was taken to propagate into the grid from the left edge.  To enforce the radiation 

condition  at  the  edges  of  grid  in  the  half-space  z  >  0,  2nd  order  Engquist-Majda 

absorbing  edge  boundary  conditions  were  used  together  with  1st  order  corner 

boundary conditions.4,5,1  However, when such boundary conditions were applied in 

the half-space z < 0, they caused a significant disturbance to the incident plane wave.  

To  eliminate  this  disturbance,  the  Neumann  boundary  condition  ∂V(x,z,t) ∂x = 0

was used in this half-space along the edges of the grid parallel to the z-axis, but it was 

then necessary to restrict the total computation time T so that no artifacts from grid-

edge  reflections  would  be  present  in  the  region  of  interest*.    A  more  efficient 

approach  would  have  been  to  use  a  scattered  field  FD-TD  formulation  to  solve  the 

complementary  strip  diffraction  problem.    The  results  for  slit  diffraction  could  then 

have been obtained with the help of Babinet's principle. 

 

Table  E-1  contains  the  computation  parameters  that  correspond  to  the 

numerical results presented in Chapter 4.  The accuracy of these results was checked 

by performing additional calculations with longer computation times and finer grids.  

Throughout  the  region    of  interest,  i.e.,  the  region  shown  in  the  color  images  of 

Chapter 4, the more accurate results differed from those in Chapter 4 by at most 4% 

in amplitude and usually by 1 to 2%.

1.  Introduction 

 

 

Spillover  is  an  effect  accompanying  heterogeneous  surface  reactions  when  inactive 

surface regions significantly influence the kinetics of the overall catalytic process. It is caused 

by  the  fact  that  those  parts  of  the  surface  which  are  inactive  in  the  surface  reaction  can  be 

active  for  other  processes  occurring  during  the  catalytic  process,  i.e.  adsorption-desorption 

processes, and increase or decrease concentrations of either substrate or product particles on 

active parts of the surface through the surface diffusion. The spillover effect is observed and 

plays a significant role in catalytic reactions on supported metal catalysts [1]. 

 

The  description  of  process  dynamics  in  systems  with  spillover  is  complicated  for 

several  reasons.  Firstly  -  surface  heterogeneity.  In  most  cases  the  heterogeneity,  because  of 

the occurrence of local effects, makes it impossible to use methods based on global chemical 

kinetics. Secondly – surface heterogeneity means not only differences in energetic properties 

of  different  surface  regions  but  also  involves  geometrical  heterogeneities.  There  are  active 

centers  with  different  energetic  properties  on  the  surface  but  additionally  those  centers  are 

often arranged in different ways (for example active centers can form various clusters placed 

on the surface in various ways or active centers can be spread randomly all over the surface). 

The chemical and physical properties of the surface depend also on the arrangement of active 

centers.  Thirdly  –  sizes  of  surface  structures  and  length  scales  characteristic  for  spillover 

processes are tenths or hundredths of nanometers.  Thus it is very complicated to use quantum 

chemical or molecular dynamics calculations to investigate such large systems and processes 

occurring  in  such  long  time  scales.  To  investigate  surface  processes  particularly  in  case  of 

inhomogeneous  surfaces  and  non-equilibrium  conditions  one  can  use  Monte  Carlo  methods 

[2,  3]  (Kinetic  Monte  Carlo  or  Dynamic  Monte  Carlo).  Such  simulation  methods  make  it 

possible to investigate systems much larger then in the case of quantum chemical calculations 

and  analyze  processes  with  characteristic  times  much  longer  than  in  molecular  dynamics

simulations. 

 

The  current  state  of  theoretical  research  of  reactions  with  spillover  effects  includes 

both  computer  simulations  and  attempts  at  the  analytical  description  of  such  processes' 

kinetics.  In  one  of  the  most  recent  theoretical  publications  in  this  subject  Zhdanov  and 

Kasemo  [4]  derived  analytical  formulas  to  describe  dynamics  of  a  model  reaction  with 

spillover  effect  -  oxidation  of  CO  on  a  supported  metal  catalyst  (for  example 

Pd

/

OAl
2
3

). 

Oxidation  reactions  of  this  type  are  good  examples  of  processes  with  spillover  from  a 

practical point of view – it is relatively simple to investigate them experimentally and they are 

important  as  actual  catalytic  processes.  However,  an  analytical  description  of  considered 

process requires many assumptions. 

On the other hand Libuda, Hoffmann et. al. [5, 6] presented experimental results and 

computer  simulations  of  kinetics  of  CO  oxidation  on 

Pd

/

OAl

  but  in  those  papers  only 

mean-field  simulation  methods  have  been  used  and  because  of  that  methodology  spatial 

heterogeneities have been neglected. 

In  this  paper  non-equilibrium  Dynamic  Monte  Carlo  simulations  were  used  to 

investigate the CO oxidation reaction with the spillover effect on a supported metal catalyst. 

This  allowed  us  to  analyze  the  heterogeneous  process  kinetics  for  a  wide  range  of  its 

parameters and to include spatial heterogeneities. Using our simulation techniques new types 

of behavior occurring in this system have been found. 

2.  System description and methodology 

In this paper we considered the dynamics of the catalytic process that can be presented 

by the following set of chemical equations:

the  surface  after  the  dissociative  adsorption  of

-  surface  reaction  product

The catalytic process takes place on the surface of the supported metal catalyst. This 

surface  consists  of  two  different  regions:  the  support  inactive  in  the  surface  reaction  (for 

example, corresponding to 

Pd

/

OAl
2
3

) and the active particles (for example, corresponding to 

nanometer Pd crystallites) – the only parts of the surface where the surface reaction given by 

Eq. 3 takes place. It was assumed that an A particle can adsorb/desorb (Eq. 1) and diffuse all 

over the surface. 

 particles can adsorb (Eq. 2) exclusively on the active region where they 

2B

dissociate  and  the  product  of  the  dissociation  (B  particles)  stays  on  the  active  region.  B 

particles  can  neither  desorb  nor  diffuse  to  the  inactive  support.  As  mentioned  above,  this 

model  can  describe,  for  example,  a  CO  oxidation  reaction  on  a  supported  metal  catalyst 

Pd

/

OAl

 [4]. 

 

Analytical  expressions  describing  the  dynamics  of  the  process  in  question  can  be 

derived assuming high surface reaction rates and high dominance of one substrate in the gas 

phase [4]. The latter assumption means that the value of the partial pressure of A substrate in 

the gas phase (

Ap

) is near 0 or 1 (partial pressures of substrates obey 

p

p
+ B

2

A

=

1

). From 

analytical results one can conclude the process achieves a maximum rate in the medium range 

of  pressures  for  various  sets  of  system  parameters.  The  maximum  rate  region  is  the  most 

important from a practical point of view. However, analytical expressions derived for extreme 

values of reactants' partial pressures do not allow exact description of the medium pressures 

range.  In  our  work  Dynamic  Monte  Carlo  simulations  allowed  us  to  analyze  the  system 

4 

behavior  in  the  whole  range  of  pressure  values.  Using  this  method  we  obtained  interesting, 

qualitatively new results. 

 

In this paper the case of well-separated active particles was considered, i.e. diffusion 

spheres  of  active  particles  did  not  overlap.  The  investigation  of  process  dynamics  in  such 

system can be reduced to simulations of the system consisting of one active particle placed on 

a relatively large support region. In our simulations the catalyst surface was represented by a 

two-dimensional  square  lattice  with  150x150  nodes.  In  the  middle  of  the  lattice  a  smaller 

square consisting of 50x50 nodes was distinguished and this square corresponded to the metal 

particle  active  in  the  surface  reaction.  The  rest  of  the  lattice  nodes  were  assumed  to  be  a 

support  inactive  in  the  surface  reaction.  Periodic  boundary  conditions  were  used  to  exclude 

the influence of the edges of simulation lattice. 

 

In  simulations  it  was  assumed  that  above  the  surface  there  is  a  mixture  of  gaseous 

substrates A and 

 with known partial pressures of both compounds 

2B

Ap

 and 

2Bp

. According 

to  the  reaction  mechanism  we  assumed  that  particles  of  substrate  A  can  adsorb  with  given 

probabilities on active and inactive lattice sites (

AP

,

ads

,

act

 and 

AP

,

ads

,

inact

 respectively). Particles 

A also can desorb from each node with probabilities 

AP ,

des,

act

 or 

AP ,

des,

inact

 because, according 

to  Eq.  1,  adsorption  of  substrate  A  is  reversible.  To  mimic  surface  diffusion,  adsorbed  A 

particles  could  move  on  the  lattice.  This  was  done  through  jumps  of  A  particle  between 

neighboring  lattice  sites  with  given  probabilities.  The  four  nearest  adjacent  sites  to  the 

considered one were regarded as neighboring (von Neumann neighborhood). The presence of 

two types of lattice sites (active – act and inactive – inact) allowed for four different types of 

jumps which could be characterized by different values of jump probabilities (from active to 

active site, active to inactive, inactive to inactive and inactive to active). 

 

It  was  assumed  that 

  particles  can  adsorb  only  on  active  lattice  sites  and  that 

2B

adsorption  is  dissociative.  Such  an  adsorption  mechanism  allows  the  adsorption  of 

2B

 

5 

particles  to  take  place  only  on  those  unoccupied  active  lattice  sites  with  at  least  one 

unoccupied  neighboring  site  – 

  adsorption  requires  the  presence  of  two  unoccupied 

2B

neighboring active lattice sites. Furthermore it was assumed that, due to the dissociation, 

2B

 

adsorption is irreversible because in the presented model the probability of 

2B

 desorption is 

smaller  than  the  probabilities  of  other  processes  (

  desorption  requires,  in  addition  to 

2B

crossing  the  surface  bonding  barrier,  additionally  the  meeting  of  two  adjacent  adsorbed  B 

particles and also the crossing of an association process energy barrier). Adsorbed B particles 

occupied  only  active  sites  because  they  could  not  diffuse  from  the  active  region  to  the 

support. In the presented model only A particles could diffuse from the support to the active 

region  and  vice  versa  –  this  diffusion  is  the  spillover.  In  simulations,  the  diffusion  of  B 

particles  adsorbed  on  the  active  region  was  neglected  because  B  particles  cannot  cross  the 

active  -  inactive  region  border  and  just  that  process  (i.e.  spillover)  governs  the  overall 

catalytic  process  dynamics.  Diffusion  processes  within  the  active  region  do  not  directly 

influence this dynamics. 

 

If  two  adjacent  active  sites  were  occupied  by  A  and  B  particles,  irreversible  surface 

reaction (Eq. 3) took place, an AB particle was formed and it was immediately removed from 

the lattice (corresponding to the immediate desorption of the product to the gas phase). The 

presence  of  neighboring  A  and  B  particles  on  the  active  region  could  be  caused  either  by 

direct  adsorption  of  A  and  B  particles  on  active  sites  or  by  surface  diffusion  of  A  particles 

from inactive to active sites. Therefore A particles could be transported to active regions by 

two different mechanisms: by direct adsorption (adsorption channel) and by surface diffusion 

from the inactive region (spillover channel). 

3.  Simulation algorithm 

 

 

 

At the beginning of each simulation, values of partial pressures of A and 

2B

 substrates 

6 

and  values  of  processes  probabilities  were  assumed.  Each  simulation  consisted  of  repeated 

identical steps. Each step started with the random choice of one site on the simulation lattice.  

• 

If the chosen lattice site was unoccupied (i.e. there was no particle adsorbed on it) an 

adsorption  attempt  was  realized;  either  an  A  or 

  particle  was  chosen  with  a 

2B

probability equal to partial pressures of substrates in the gas phase. 

o  If  an  A  particle  was  chosen,  an  adsorption  attempt  was  realized  with  the 

probability   

AP

,

ads

,

act

  or 

AP

,

ads

,

inact

  (corresponding  to  the  kind  of  the  chosen 

lattice site). After this attempt, and independently of its results, the simulation 

step ended. 

o  If a 

2B

 particle was chosen, one additional neighboring site of the current one 

was  randomly  chosen  because  the 

  adsorption  required  two  unoccupied 

2B

neighboring sites. If the chosen neighboring site was occupied, the simulation 

step ended. If it was empty, an adsorption attempt on both the current and the 

neighboring site was realized with the probability 

BP

,

ads

,

act

 or 

BP

,

ads

,

inact

 (in the 

presented  model 

BP

,

ads

,

inact

=0  because 

2B

  could  adsorb  only  on  the  active 

region of the surface). After the 

 adsorption attempt, and independently of 

2B

its results, the simulation step ended. 

• 

If the lattice site chosen at the beginning of the simulation step was occupied and it 

contained  an  A  particle,  one  of  the  three  processes  was  chosen:  the  diffusion, 

desorption or reaction. 

o  In  the  case  of  diffusion,  one  of  four  neighboring  sites  was  randomly  chosen 

and if it was occupied, the simulation step ended. If the neighboring site was 

empty,  an  attempt  of  the  particle  jump  to  this  empty  site  was  made  with  the 

probability depending on the kind of the starting and the target site. After this 

attempt simulation step ended. 

7 

o  In  the  case  of  the  desorption  an  attempt  of  removing  the  particle  out  of  the 

lattice with the probability 

AP

,

act

 or 

AP

,

des

,

inact

 (depending on the kind of the 

lattice site) was made. After this attempt and independently of its results, the 

simulation step ended. 

o  In the case of reaction, one of the four neighboring sites was randomly chosen. 

If  the  neighboring  site  was  either  empty  or  occupied  by  an  A  particle,  the 

simulation step ended whereas if it was occupied by a B particle (adsorbed in 

an active site due to the fact that every B particle was adsorbed exclusively on 

the active region) an reaction attempt was realized with the probability 

rP

. If 

the reaction attempt succeeded, both reacting particles were removed from the 

lattice. Independently of the reaction attempt results, the simulation step ended. 

• 

If the lattice site chosen at the beginning of the simulation step was occupied and it 

contained  a  B  particle,  the  simulation  step  ended.  B  particles,  in  contradistinction  to 

particles  A,  could  neither  diffuse  nor  desorb  in  our  model  and  the  possibility  of  the 

surface  reaction  in  the  algorithm  was  taken  into  account  when  A  particles  were 

considered. 

 

 

In  Monte  Carlo  simulations  some  details  of  implementation  of  physical  processes  in 

the simulation algorithm are important only if quantitative results are required, e.g. if the rate 

constants are calculated based on the values of processes probabilities [7, 8]. In the presented 

algorithm,  for  example,  the  exclusion  of  the  surface  reaction  when  a  B  particle  is  found, 

causes that the reaction probability should be multiplied by the factor 2 if one wants to use it 

to  calculate  macroscopic  quantities.  In  this  paper  we  are  interested  only  in  the  qualitative 

description  of  the  system  so  absolute  values  of  probabilities  do  not  matter,  only  ratios  of 

probabilities are important. 

 

The first stage of each simulation was an equilibration phase. Due to the fact that at 

8 

the beginning of each simulation the number and configuration of particles on the lattice in 

general was changing, it was necessary to wait until the system reaches a stationary state (i.e. 

until, for given values of pressures and probabilities, numbers of adsorbed particles of each 

kind and the rate of the product creation were fluctuating around constant values). After the 

equilibration  phase  an  averaging  phase  started  –  average  values  of  numbers  of  adsorbed 

particles and the reaction rate were calculated based on a certain number of simulation steps 

in the stationary state. 

4.  Simulations and results 

 

 

 

The presented algorithm was used to simulate the dynamics of processes in the model 

of the catalytic process with the spillover introduced in Section 2. Parameters of simulations 

were  chosen  to  correspond  to  assumptions  which  were  taken  during  the  derivation  of  the 

analytical description of the system by Zhdanov and Kasemo in [4]. This means mainly that 

the  simulations  were  carried  out  always  in  the  high  reaction  rates  regime  and  therefore  the 

value  of  reaction  probability  was  always  high  in  comparison  with  probabilities  of  other 

processes.  The  simulations  were  carried  out  for  certain  sets  of  the  model  parameters  to 

investigate the dynamics of the system for various values of reactants' partial pressures. 

 

The  results  presented  by  Zhdanov  and  Kasemo  [4]  show  that  analytical  solutions 

derived for extreme values of partial pressures, i.e. starting either from values of 

Ap

 near 0 or 

near  1  and  used  in  a  moderate  region  of  pressures  lead  to  two  different  types  of  behavior, 

especially  that  there  exists  multiple  steady-state and hysteretic effects may occur. To verify 

the hypothesis about a hysteresis and to find multiple stable stationary states, for each set of 

model  parameters,  two  different  series  of  simulations  were  performed.  The  first  series  was 

started with an empty lattice for a small, close to zero, value of 

. Than, when the stable 

Ap

stationary-state  was  reached  and  average  numbers  of  particles  were  constant,  results  were 

9 

calculated,  the  value  of 

  was  increased  by  a  certain  interval  and  a  new  simulation  was 

Ap

started (at the beginning of every next simulation the lattice was not empty). The procedure 

was repeated until the value of 

 was near 1. The second series of simulations was carried 

Ap

on in an analogous way but the first simulation in these series was started for 

Ap

 value near 1 

and  in  succeeding  simulations 

  was  decreasing.  In  the  simulations  the 

Ap

Ap

  value  was 

changing in 192 steps with a 0.05 interval, from 0.02 to 0.98 in the first type series and from 

0.98 to 0.02 in the second type. 

 

The  simulations  were  carried  on  using  both  lattices  consisting  of  active  and  inactive 

sites (this corresponded to a catalyst with an active metal particle on the support) and using 

lattices built of active sites only (this corresponded to the system where the catalytic process 

occurs only on an active metal particle without contribution of the support). The comparison 

of the results obtained from both types of simulations allows to investigate the influence of 

the spillover effects on the considered catalytic process. In each simulation surface coverages 

of an active and inactive region and the surface reaction rate were analyzed. The reaction rate 

was calculated as the number of product particles created in a Monte Carlo step (MC step). 

The  MC  step  consisted  of  simulation  steps  described  in  Section  3  and  the  number  of  those 

steps in the MC step was equal to the number of sites in the simulation lattice. 

 

The  number  of  steps  necessary  for  equilibration  was  determined  in  a  series  of 

introductory simulations and it was equal to 2000 MC steps whereas 100 MC steps after the 

equilibration were taken to average simulation results. Based on introductory simulations, an 

adsorption probability of 

 particles on the active region was determined as 

2B

BP ,ads

,

act

=0.005. 

Probability of diffusion of adsorbed A particles was taken as 1.0 independently on the kind of 

the  starting  and  target  lattice  site  (an  isotropic  lateral  diffusion).  The  probability  of  surface 

reaction  was  equal  to  0.99.  Probabilities  of  desorption  of  A  particles  from  both  active  and 

inactive sites were determined as 0.5 and 0.05 respectively. The choosing of values of the two 

remaining  probabilities  in  the  model  (probabilities  of  A  adsorption  on  active  and  inactive 

10 

sites: 

AP

,

ads

,

act

  and 

AP

,

ads

,

inact

)  allows  to  control  the  spillover  process  and  to  investigate  its 

influence  on  the  overall  catalytic  process.  Adsorption  and  desorption  probabilities  in  each 

simulation  were 

fixed, 

i.e. 

lateral 

adsorbate-adsorbate 

interactions 

changing 

adsorption/desorption energy barriers were neglected. As mentioned in Section 3, in a case of 

a qualitative analysis of simulations results, only ratios of probabilities and not their absolute 

values influence the dynamics of processes. Therefore, in the presented simulations, values of 

those  probabilities  were  chosen  to  qualitatively  correspond  to  system  properties,  e.g.  high 

reaction rates regime, and than those values were optimized to achieve, in sequence, the best 

agreement  with  analytical  results,  the  smallest  calculation  effort  and  the  smallest  statistical 

errors. 

 

 

 

4.1  Reaction on the active metal particle 

In  this  section  results  of  simulations  with  lattices  consisting  only  of  active  sites  are 

presented.  The  results  correspond  to  the  case  of  reaction  occurring  only  on  an  active  metal 

particle without influence of inactive support and therefore without the spillover effect. Fig. 1. 

presents the surface reaction rate (measured as a number of product particles created in one 

MC step per one lattice site) vs. partial pressure of A substrate. The results of the two series of 

simulations: with either an increasing (marked as 'inc') and decreasing ('dec') value of

Ap

At  the  beginning  of  the  series  with  increasing  values  of 

  the  surface  is  covered 

Ap

mainly by B particles but the surface coverage is lower than 100%. Only if the 

Ap

 pressure 

crosses  certain  value  (about  0.18)  all  surface  sites  are  covered  by  B.  This  effect  may  arise 

from  a  dissociative  adsorption  of 

2B

  particles.  If 

Ap

=0,  when  in  the  gas  phase  only 

2B

 

particles are present, 

 adsorption is the only possible process in the system. This adsorption 

2B

is irreversible but it cannot lead to 100% coverage of B particles because 

2B

 particles adsorb 

on  the  surface  with  randomly  chosen  orientations  and  therefore  some  lattice  sites  remain 

unoccupied.  Because  the  adsorption  of 

  cannot  occur  on  single-unoccupied  sites,  B 

2B

coverage is less than 100%. If 

 is slightly higher than 0, an additional adsorption process 

Ap

occurs - particles A can adsorb on single-unoccupied lattice sites. Therefore, even for small 

values of 

Ap

, B particles cannot poison the surface and the surface reaction occurs although, 

because of the small A coverage, its rate is very low. 

 

The poisoning of the surface after crossing certain value of 

 is caused by the fact 

Ap

that the presence of adsorbed A particles leads to the surface reaction and each reaction act 

leads  to  the  creation  of  two  unoccupied  adjacent lattice sites. Therefore, because 

2B

 is still 

dominant in the gas phase, these unoccupied sites can be attacked by 

 and the coverage of 

2B

B  increases.  The  presence  of  certain  amount  of  A  particles  is  necessary  for  B  particles  to 

poison the surface if the latter are the product of dissociative two-center 

2B

 adsorption and 

adsorption  centers  for  A  and  B  particles  are  the  same.  Successive  increasing  of 

Ap

  cannot 

decrease the B coverage because the B adsorption is irreversible and  the only way to decrease 

the number of adsorbed B particles is the surface reaction with A but the number of adsorbed 

A particles is very small due to they are quickly consumed by the fast surface reaction. The 

effect of that processes is the complete surface poisoning by B particles. 

 

In the series of simulations with decreasing values of 

 the surface for high values of 

Ap

Ap

 is covered almost only by A particles but because of the reversibility of an A adsorption, 

the  surface  is  not  poisoned.  Therefore,  even  for  high  values  of 

,  the  surface  reaction 

p

A

occurs. The decreasing of 

 causes the increasing of B coverage and for a certain value of 

Ap

pressure (about 0.7) the surface becomes poisoned by B particles (the reason is identical like 

in the previous series of simulations) and the surface reaction cannot occur. 

 

The  presented  results  show  that  for  two  regions  of 

  values  at  least  two  stable 

Ap

stationary states exist in the system. For small 

 values (below 0.16) two stable states exist: 

Ap

the state in which the reaction occurs (reached in the 'inc' series) and the state with the surface 

poisoned  by  B  (reached  in  the  'dec'  series).  For  high 

  values  (above  0.7)  two  other 

Ap

stationary states exist: the state in which the reaction occurs (in this 

 region this stationary 

Ap

state is reached in the 'dec' series) and the state with the surface poisoned by B (reached in the 

'inc' series). 

 

If  the  simulations  start  with  an  empty  surface,  the  system  would  always  reach  the 

stationary  state  with  lower  value  of  the  surface  coverage  because  the  final  stationary  state 

14 

depends on initial conditions of the system. In the case of experimental investigations of such 

systems  the  situation  would  be  the  same,  if  one  started  an  experiment  with  the  surface  not 

covered by an adsorbate or covered by only one reactant (see [5, 6]), one would reach finally 

only one stable stationary state. In our simulations, starting from both low and high values of 

Ap

  caused  that  two  stable  stationary  states  could  be  reached.  Holovko  and  Vakarin  have 

shown  [9]  that  in  the  heterogeneous  CO  oxidation  there  exist  many  stable  and  unstable 

stationary  states  and  two  of  them  are  stable.  The  presence  of  two  stable  stationary  states  is 

confirmed in our simulations. 

4.2  Reaction on the active metal particle with the support and the spillover effect. 

In this section results of simulations with lattices consisting of both active and inactive 

sites  are  presented.  Those  results  correspond  to  the  case  of  the  reaction  occurring  on  a 

supported metal catalyst where a metal particle is placed on the inactive support and spillover 

effects  occur.  Fig.  4.  presents  the  surface  reaction  rate  (measured  as  a  number  of  product 

particles created in one MC step per one active lattice site) vs. partial pressure of A substrate. 

Results of two series of simulations: with increasing (marked as 'inc') and decreasing ('dec') 

value  of 

Ap

  are  shown.  This  figure  is  similar  to  Fig.  1.  but  the  influence  of  the  support  is 

included.

In  distinction  from  the  simulations  with  active  lattice  sites  only,  in  presence  of 

spillover, both series of simulations (with increasing and decreasing values of 

Ap

) show that 

reaction occurs in a wide range of 

 values and the reaction rate is about 3 times higher than 

Ap

in the case of active sites only. As in the previous case, one can find an explanation analyzing 

surface coverages. Fig. 5. presents A particles' coverage of the whole surface - both active and 

inactive region (measured as a number of adsorbed A particles per one lattice site) vs. partial 

pressure of A substrate.

The active region coverage of B particles vs. partial pressure of A in the gas phase for simulation series with the 

increasing ('inc') and decreasing ('dec') value of 

 in the case of the active metal particle with the support and 

Ap

 

 

 

In  the  presence  of  the  inactive  support,  independently  on  the 

Ap

  value,  the  active 

region of the surface is not poisoned by B particles. The escape of B particles to the inactive 

support cannot be the reason of this effect because, according to assumptions of the model, B 

particles  do  not  diffuse.  Therefore  the  only  reasonable  explanation  of  this  effect  is  the 

diffusion of A particles from the inactive support to the active region. Even for low values of 

Ap

  and  high  values  of  B  coverage  of  the  active  region,  the  reaction  occurs  because  the  A 

substrate  is  provided  from  the  support  with  the  surface  diffusion  and  at  least  at  the  border 

between the active and inactive region the reaction always occurs. It leads to the decrease of B 

coverage on the active region and therefore A particles can adsorb directly on active sites from 

the gas phase. The effect of the lower than 100% B coverage on supported metal catalysts was 

observed  experimentally  [11,  12].  In  previous  Monte  Carlo  studies  the  effect  was  either 

neglected or included by artificial assumptions in a simulation algorithm [13]. In the case of 

spillover, just like in the case described in Section 4.1, more than one stable stationary states 

of surface coverages are present and these states appear in the ranges of low and high values 

of 

. Ap

 

The comparison between Fig. 1. and Fig. 4. allows to conclude that the presence of the 

inactive  support  and  the  diffusion  of  A  particles  from  and  to  the  active  region  does  not 

significantly change the rate of the reaction in high values of the 

 range. The reaction rates 

Ap

for 

Ap

=0.9 on both Fig. 4. and Fig. 1. are comparable. However, a new high band occurs on 

Fig.  4.  near 

Ap

=0.25.  We  conclude  that  the  reaction  in  the  range  of  high  values  of 

Ap

  is 

governed  by  the  same  mechanism  as  in  the  system without an inactive support, but for low 

values of 

p

 the reaction is supported by the surface diffusion from the inactive support. In 

A

other words, in the range of high 

 the reaction is governed by the adsorption channel, and 

Ap

for low 

Ap

 – by the spillover channel. These conclusions differ from ones obtained from an 

analytical  description  by  Zhdanov  and  Kasemo  [4]  because  in  our  case  in  the  presence  of 

inactive support a band that comes from the adsorption channel still exists for high values of 

p

A

.  The  system  with  the  inactive  support  and  the  spillover  keeps  properties  of  the  system 

without  support  and  shows  those  properties  in  the  case  of  high  values  of  the  A  substrate 

pressure. The next difference is the presence of hysteretic effects for both low and high values 

of 

Ap

 and not for moderate 

Ap

 region. 

 

To  investigate  more  precisely  the  influence  of  spillover  channel  on  the  behavior  of 

18 

both  bands  occurring  on  the  rate  vs. 

 plot, a series of simulations analogous to previous 

Ap

one but for different values of A adsorption probability on the inactive region were carried on. 

Fig.  8.  presents  the  maximum  reaction  rate  obtained  in  series  of  simulations  for  one  set  of

The partial pressure of A reactant corresponding to the maximum reaction rate vs. probability of A adsorption 

 

 

 

 

Fig.  8.  and  Fig.  9.  show  that  the  increasing  influence  of  spillover  channel  leads  to  the 

increasing  of  the  maximum  reaction  rate  whereas  the 

  pressure  corresponding  to  that 

Ap

maximum,  is  decreasing.  When  the  spillover  becomes  more  important,  the  reaction  rate 

increases in the range of low 

 pressures. In the case of weak spillover, the system acts as a 

system consisting of active centers without a support. This effect is shown on Fig. 10. which 

presents the reaction rate vs.

Among  various  models  considered  in  the  present  work  (with  different  values  of  all

region is much faster than in simulations presented in the previous section. Fig. 11. and Fig.

In this case the reaction rate is high even in the system consisting only of active sites 

and  the  range  of 

  values  for  which  the  reaction  occurs  is  much  wider  than  in  the  cases 

Ap

presented  in  previous  sections  (compare  with  Fig.  1).  The  presence  of  the  active  support 

causes the increasing of the reaction rate near 

=0.7 and additionally broadens the range of 

Ap

active pressures. But since reaction on the isolated active region is very fast, the height of the 

band located near 

=0.7 is still bigger than the height of the band coming from the spillover 

Ap

channel.  This  effect  is  different  than  in  the  cases  presented  above  because  now,  in 

contradiction  to  Fig.  10,  even  for  low  values  of  the  ratio

AP

  (this  ratio

reaction occurs always in the whole range of 

 values. In previous simulations the reaction

 values only if

It is noteworthy that for certain values of A adsorption probabilities on both the active 

and inactive surface region one can get the system in which the reaction rate will be almost 

independent  of  reactants'  partial  pressures.  Such  an  experimental  system  with CO oxidation 

on 

Pt

/ SnO

 catalyst was reported, for example, by Grass and Linz [10] but in that work the 

2

system  behavior  was  explained  using  a  different model (a reaction mechanism including an 

oxygen migration was proposed). 

5.  Conclusions 

 

 

 

Supported  metal  catalysts  show  both  energetic  and  spatial  heterogeneities.  Dynamic 

Monte Carlo simulations can treat those inhomogeneities explicitly. In this article results of 

Dynamic  Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  the  model  reaction  of  CO  oxidation  on  the  supported 

22 

metal  catalyst  are  presented.  In  this  reaction  the  influence  of  oxide  support  is  significant 

because  of  the  presence  of  spillover  effects  and  therefore  the  importance  of  spillover  was 

investigated.  We  simulated  catalytic  systems  both  with  and  without  spillover  effects  and  in 

the  former  case  the  importance  of  spillover  was  controlled  by  adjusting  the  spillover 

contribution. 

In systems without spillover: 

a)  The  catalyst  surface  cannot  be  poisoned  by  the  B  reactant  if  reactant  A  is  not  present 

because of the two-center dissociative adsorption of B. Only if reactant A is present and its 

partial pressure is low, B particles can poison the catalyst. 

b) Two stable stationary states of B coverage were found both for low and high values of 

Ap

 

and hysteresis occurs in the reaction rate for both low and high values of 

Ap

. 

c)  The reaction rate achieves maximum for high values of 

. Ap

In systems with spillover: 

d) The surface cannot be poisoned by B particles for any value of 

Ap

. If 

Ap

=0 the effect is 

caused by two-center adsorption whereas for 

>0 the reason is the constant presence of 

Ap

A particles on the active region due to diffusion from the support. We have obtained this 

effect without additional assumptions in the algorithm as in the previous studies. 

e)  The  reaction  is  possible  for  every  value  of 

Ap

  (except 

Ap

=0  and 

Ap

=1)  because  the 

surface cannot be poisoned. 

f)  Depending  on  the  value  of 

,  reaction  occurs  in  two  regimes:  driven  by  the  spillover 

Ap

channel and driven by the direct adsorption of A on the active region of the surface. 

g) Two stable stationary states of B coverage were found for both low and high values of 

Ap

 

and hysteresis occurs in reaction rate for both low and high values of 

Ap

. 

h) Relative values of reaction rate in the case of reaction  driven by the spillover channel and 

reaction driven by the direct adsorption of A on the active region depend on relative values 

23 

of probabilities of adsorption and desorption of A on the support and on the active region 

of  the  catalyst  surface.  For  certain  values  of  those  probabilities  one  can  get  a  system  in 

which the reaction rate will be almost independent of partial pressures of reactants. 

Qualitative  conclusions  summarized  in  points  b,  f,  g  and  h  are  different  from  the 

results obtained by Zhdanov and Kasemo in [4] where an analytical model was used. During 

Dynamic  Monte  Carlo  simulations  we  found  multiple  stable  stationary  states  and  hysteresis 

(points  b  and  g)  due  to  the  selection  of  initial  conditions  used  in  simulations.  Two  reaction 

regimes  i.e. driven by spillover and driven by adsorption (points f and h) were found because 

we were able to use one model for the whole range of values of reactants' partial pressures. 

Analytical  solutions  require  additional  assumptions  about  partial  pressures  and  surface 

geometry, whereas Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations can be used for wide variety of model 

parameters and can treat surface heterogeneity explicitly. 

Dynamic  Monte  Carlo  simulations  are  a  useful  tool  to  study  processes  occurring  on 

heterogeneous  surfaces,  but  because  of  the  lack  of  experimental  data  which  are  needed  to 

calculate  model  parameters,  in  most  cases  their  results  should  be  treated  only  qualitatively. 

Therefore results presented in this work show qualitatively what kind of effects can occur in 

systems with spillover and which parameters of the system are responsible for them.

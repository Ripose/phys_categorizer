Abstract 

In  line  of  the  intermediate-term  monitoring  of  seismic  activity  aimed  at 
prediction  of  the  world  largest  earthquakes  the  seismic  dynamics  of  the  Earth’s 
lithosphere is analysed as a single whole, which is the ultimate scale of the complex 
hierarchical  non-linear  system.  The  present  study  demonstrates  that  the  lithosphere 
does  behave,  at  least  in  intermediate-term  scale,  as  non-linear  dynamic  system  that 
reveals  classical  symptoms  of  instability  at  the  approach  of  catastrophe,  i.e.,  mega-
earthquake.  These  are:  (i)  transformation  of  magnitude  distribution,  (ii)  spatial 
redistribution of seismic activity, (iii) rise and acceleration of activity, (iv) change of 
dependencies  across  magnitudes  of  different  types,  and  other  patterns  of  collective 
behaviour. The observed global scale seismic behaviour implies the state of criticality 
of the Earth lithosphere in the last decade.  
 

Introduction 

 
Correlation in earthquake occurrence at long distances is a prominent feature 
of  seismic  dynamics  investigated  in  many  seismological  studies.  Such  correlation 
appears  as  simultaneous  changes  of  seismic  activity  within  a  large  number  of 
neighbouring regions (Keilis-Borok & Malinovskaya, 1964; Dobrovolsky et al., 1979; 
Sykes  &  Jaume  1990;  Zaliapin  et  al.  2002),  migration  of  the  earthquakes  along  the 
fault  zones  (Mogi  1968,  1985;  Vil’kovich  &  Shnirman  1983;  Wallace  1987),  long-
range interaction of the earthquakes (Prozorov & Schreider 1990; Kagan & Jackson 
1991,  Shebalin  et  al.,  2000),  global  spatial-and-temporal  patterns  in  the  seismic 
energy release (Benioff 1951; Mogi 1979; Romanowicz 1993; Bufe & Perkins 2005) 
and  other.  Although  definite  physical  mechanism  of  stress  and  strain  redistribution 
over  such  long  distances  is  still  unknown,  the  long-range  correlation  of  earthquakes 
might  be  attributed  to  large-  or  even  global-scale  processes  taking  place  in  the 
lithosphere  (Barenblatt  et  al.,  1983;  Press  &  Allen,  1995).  Another,  more  general 
approach regards long-range correlation as a common feature of complex non-linear 
hierarchical dynamic systems (Keilis-Borok, 1990, 2002; Sornette & Sammis, 1995; 
Turcotte et al., 2000), which example the lithosphere of the Earth represents.  

There  is  growing  evidence  that  the  process  of  earthquake  generation  is  not 
localised  about  its  future  source  but  involves  an  area  that  exceeds  the  size  of 
forthcoming  earthquake  by  ten  or  more  times  (Dobrovolsky  et  al.,  1979;  Sadovsky, 
ed.  1986;  Keilis-Borok  1990,  2002;  Press  &  Allen,  1995;  Bowman  et  al.  1998). 
Accordingly, manifestations of an earthquake approach may also come from territory 
that  wide.  This  concept  provided  foundation  for  a  series  of  earthquake  prediction 
algorithms  (see  Keilis-Borok  &  Soloviev,  2003,  for  the  list  and  descriptions).  The 
authors  regard  a  lithosphere  as  a  complex  non-linear  hierarchical  dynamic  system 
where strong earthquakes are critical phenomena, different for different scales of the 
hierarchy. By using a pattern recognition technique they search for symptoms of the 
system instability within rather wide territory around prospective earthquake source.

The linear dimension L of the investigation area depends on the magnitude M0 of the 
target earthquake; usually, L(M0) is about 5-10 times more than its rupture length. For 
example,  in  the  M8  algorithm  (Keilis-Borok  &  Kossobokov,  1990),  L(8.0)  is  about 
1300 km in diameter. Naturally, the stronger is the target earthquake the wider is the 
territory involved in the process of its preparation. The algorithms being tested in real-
time experiments demonstrate high predictive ability both at the global and regional 
scales  (Kossobokov  et  al.  1999;  Rotwain  &  Novikova,  1999;  Romashkova  & 
Kossobokov, 2005) that, in fact, is solid indirect evidence in support of the extended 
earthquake preparation area. 

The  recent  devastating  mega-thrust  December  26,  2004,  magnitude  9.0 
earthquake ripped the subduction zone over 1500 km from off west coast of Northern 
Sumatra to Andaman Islands. The event is among the top ten instrumentally recorded 
earthquakes of the last hundred years.  Following the concept described above one can 
deduce  that  preparation  of  the  2006  Sumatra-Andaman  earthquake  might  have 
involved the territory of about 7500–15000 km in linear dimension. This size exceeds 
the radius of the Earth and is comparable with the extent of the Earth’s hemisphere. It 
suggests that the generation of such a mega-earthquake is likely to have a world-wide 
scale, rather than to involve interaction of a confined regional fault system. Therefore 
it  is  not  unreasonable  to  search  for  symptoms  of  instability  at  the  approach  of  the 
mega-earthquake,  and  hence  some  premonitory  phenomena,  by  analysing  the 
lithosphere  as  a  single  whole,  which  represents  the  ultimate  scale  of  the  complex 
Earth's  hierarchy.  The  premonitory  phenomena  may  express  themselves  in  various 
changes  of  basic  integral  characteristics  of  the  global  seismic  activity  or  other 
geophysical parameters, as well as to appear at different time scales that are unknown 
a priori.  

The  basic  types  of  the  seismic  premonitory  phenomena  are  listed  in  Keilis-
Borok,  (1990,  2002).  They  reflect  changes  in  the  rate  and  regularity  of  earthquake 
occurrence,  their  territory  distribution,  clustering  in  space  and  time,  and  relation 
between earthquakes from different magnitude ranges. The premonitory phenomena is 
captured  by  different  seismicity  patterns  within  a  given  territory,  time  interval  and 
magnitude  range.  The  time  scale  of  the  patterns  varies  from  102  years  to  hours  that 
implies  rough  subdivision  of  the  prediction  problem  into  large-,  intermediate-  and 
short-term. The magnitude range can be different for different patterns, so sometimes 
several  ranges  are  analysed  in  parallel  to  ensure  reliable  results  (Kossobokov  et  al., 
1999). Due to the complex nature of seismicity a use of combination of the patterns, 
even if correlated by definition, often yields better prediction than monitoring of the 
individual one (Keilis-Borok & Soloviev, 2003).  

In  present  work,  by  analysing  the  world  earthquake  catalogues,  we  intend  to 
find  the  global-scale  (involving  the  whole  lithosphere)  intermediate-term  (formed 
within  several  years)  seismic  precursory  phenomena  of  mega-earthquake.  To 
investigate  the  problem  we  analyse  the  temporal  variations  of  the  frequency-
magnitude distribution (hereinafter FM) of the global seismicity for several layers of 
the Earth depth. Such approach allows us to control emergence of precursory patterns 
related  to  variation  of  earthquake  rates  in  different  magnitude  ranges,  as  well  as  to 
redistribution of the seismic activity in depth.  

The  two  world-wide  catalogues,  i.e.,  the  National  Earthquake  Information 
Center  Global  Hypocenters  Database  (GHDB,  1989)  and  the  Harvard  Centroid 
Moment Tensor catalogue (Ekstrom et al., 2005, and references therein), are used. It 
is  of  common  knowledge  that  it  is  of  great  importance,  for  temporal  analysis  in 
particular, to have a clear understanding on homogeneity and completeness of the data

source in the space-time-magnitude domain under study. Therefore, to determine the 
data for further investigation, we give special attention to the detailed analysis of the 
catalogues. The necessary precondition implies using the uniform and homogeneous 
magnitude scale throughout extended range (of at least several magnitude units) and 
the stable completeness of the data covering the territory of interest over a long period 
of  time.  The  preliminary  data  analysis  is  described  in  the  first  paragraph.  Then  we 
apply  temporal  frequency-magnitude-depth  analysis  to  the  uniform  data  and  draw 
inferences from empirical observations. Finally, we discuss the results of analysis in 
connection with those of the previous studies and make conclusions. 

 
Preliminary data analysis 

The  first  considered  is  the  US  Geological  Survey,  National  Earthquake 
Information Center Global Hypocenters Database (GHDB, 1989) with duplicates 
identified  and  removed  by  automatic  procedure  of  P.  Shebalin  (1992),  routinely 
updated  through  2004  from  NEIC  Preliminary  Determination  of  Epicenters  data 
(PDE)  available  on-line  (http://neic.usgs.gov/neis/data_services/ftp_files.html).    It  is 
referred hereinafter as NEIC. Every event in NEIC is supplied with the original time, 
latitude, longitude, depth and up to four magnitude determinations M1, M2, M3 and 
M4,  along  with  other  information.  First  and  second  magnitudes  are  occupied  by  mb 
and  MS  correspondingly.  Since  mid-1960ies  when  the  World  Wide  Standard 
Seismograph Network was installed M1 and M2 are the average determinations of mb 
and  MS  reported  by  seismic  stations.  The  other  two  magnitudes  M3  and  M4  report 
estimates  of  different  type  attributed  to  different  authority  or  agency.  Since  the 
beginning  of  1993  M3  and  M4  host  for  the  most  part  the  moment  magnitudes 
determined at USGS or at Harvard University.

Different coloured lines stacked from higher ranges provide the number of earthquakes above a certain 
magnitude  threshold  Mthreshold,  with  the  step  of  0.5  magnitude.  The  diagrams  correspond  to  the  four 
magnitudes in the NEIC: a) mb (M1), b) MS (M2), c) M3 and d) M4.

Fig. 1 displays the temporal evolution of the annual number of earthquakes of 
different magnitude ranges for each of the four magnitudes M1, M2, M3, M4 reported 
in NEIC. Different ranges of 0.5-magnitude width are given in different colour. The 
ordinate  is  in  logarithmic  scale  to  facilitate  recognising  whether  the  frequency-
magnitude  distribution  fits  the  Gutenberg-Richter  relation  (Gutenberg  &  Richter, 
1954;  hereinafter  G-R):  in  fact,  a  near-uniform  distance  between  adjacent  FM  plots 
corresponds to a power-law distribution of earthquake sizes. Fig. 1 illustrates the great 
difference of completeness and stability of the reported magnitudes. Specifically, the 
magnitude  mb  (M1)  is  quite  uniformly  presented  starting  from  1963.  Similarly,  the 
magnitude  MS  (M2)  appears  uniform  from  1968,  although  the  number  of  mb 
determinations in NEIC is about ten times larger than that of MS. The magnitudes mb 
and MS below 4.5 are essentially incomplete in all times to the present. Moreover, the 
number  of  magnitude  4.5  events  grows  gradually  and  reaches  the  level  of 
completeness  at  about  1995.  Thus,  when  analysing  seismic  activity  in  1969-2004 
making  use  of  mb  and  MS  the  level  of  completeness  should  be  set  at  the  common 
value about 5.0 or larger. Note that the body-wave magnitude scale mb is known for a 
saturation effect, i.e., for being almost insensitive to distinguish and order large size 
earthquakes, which is evident from the increasingly larger widths for magnitudes mb 
above  6.0  and  the  absence  of  mb=7.5  or  more  in  Fig.  1.  The  M3  and  M4  although 
presented  since  the  beginning  of  the  last  century  are  not  uniform  in  time.  In  fact, 
several evident changes in the level of completeness can be observed in Fig. 1 (e.g., 
1931,  mid-1960s,  1994)  that  is  explained  by  the  diversity  of  the  magnitude  scales 
appearing in these two positions of NEIC. Therefore, the use of M3 and M4 without a 
multitude  of  proper  calibrations  in  an  analysis  of  seismic  variability  seems  futile  at 
least before 1993.

5.5; b) surface-wave magnitude MS ≥ 5.5, 1969-2004. 

 
Most  of  the  events  in  NEIC  (about  99%)  both  shallow  and  deep  holds  mb 
determination  (Fig.  2a).  Fig.  3  shows  frequency-depth  distributions  plotted  for 
earthquakes in 1969-2004 from different ranges of mb. The ordinate is in logarithmic 
scale, so that a vertical slice of the diagram represents the FM distribution of events at 
a particular depth. One can see that the frequency-depth distributions are very similar 
in all magnitude ranges: The majority of earthquakes occur within the upper layer of 
the lithosphere; going deeper a near exponential decrease of the rate is observed down 

4

 

to  300  km;  in  between  300  and  500  km  seismic  activity  has  roughly  the  same  rate; 
further down, at depths of 500–600 km there is a certain increase of the seismic rate 
followed by sharp falloff to zero at about 700 km.  
 

Figure 3. Frequency-depth distributions of the earthquakes with mb magnitude for different magnitude 
ranges,  1969-2004.  Different  coloured  lines  provide  the  number  of  earthquakes  above  a  certain 
magnitude threshold Mthreshold, with the step of 0.5 magnitude. The width of the depth sorting bins is 25 
km.  

 
It  is  of  common  knowledge  that,  although  some  exceptions  exist,  magnitude 
MS  is  determined  mostly  for  shallow  earthquakes.  Indeed,  Fig.  2b,  shows  explicitly 
that  the  depth,  h,  of  an  overwhelming  majority  of  earthquakes  with  reported  MS  in 
NEIC  does  not  exceed  50  km.  More  deep  earthquakes  are  uncommon  and  their 
appearance in time is irregular. Furthermore often, when automatic determination of 
the  depth  is  problematic,  earthquakes  are  used  to  be  put  by  seismologists  at  a  few 
standard depths, e.g., for shallow ones at 10 km (19% of all events) or 33 km (34%). 

Thus taking into account the above-mentioned limitations we consider for the 
analysis  here  the  period  1969-2004  and  the  two  NEIC  magnitudes  mb  (M1)  and MS 
(M2)  (Table  2).  The  analysis  based  on  mb  will  involve  earthquakes  from  all  depths 
along  with  their  subdivisions  into  upper  (h  ≤  100  km),  intermediate  (100  km  <  h  ≤ 
300 km), deep (300 km < h ≤ 500 km) and ultra-deep (h > 500 km) ones. The analysis 
based on MS will be performed for all shallow earthquakes with h ≤ 50 km.  

Next we analyse for different magnitude ranges the annual percentage P of the 
records holding mb and MS in NEIC. The results are summarised in Table 1 and Fig. 
4. It is evident that the mb magnitude is the dominant source of the earthquake size in 
NEIC:  it  is  reported  for  99%  of  all  registered  earthquakes  in  all  magnitude  ranges 
down to magnitude 5.0, and the high percentage remains persistent in 1969-2004. On 
the contrary, the MS is reasonably complete (P > 95% when averaged over the entire 
time  of  analysis)  for  magnitude  6.0  and  above  only.  For  lower  range  of  magnitude 
5.5–6.0 P reaches about constant level of 90% after 1980. For 5.0–5.5 the percentage 
of the MS is very unstable, it varies between 20% and 80%, gradually increases with 
time with average about 50%. Therefore, we conclude that seismic activity in 1969-
2004 could be described with a great confidence either by earthquakes of the mb ≥ 5.0 
or those of the MS ≥ 6.0 (Table 1). At the same time we keep in mind the saturation of 
the  mb  magnitude  scale  and  the  restricted  use  of  the  MS  magnitude  scale  for  sizing, 
almost exclusively, shallow earthquakes.

The  Harvard  University  group  compiles  on  a  regular  basis  centroid-moment 
tensor  solutions  for  the  entire  Globe  (Ekstrom  et  al.,  2005).  For  each  seismic  event 
their  Centroid  Moment  Tensor  catalogue,  CMT  catalogue  provides  information 
including  the  origin  time,  latitude,  longitude,  depth,  magnitudes  mb  and  MS,  and 
scalar  moment  M0.  Following  Kanamori  (1977)  the  scalar  moment  is  usually 
recalculated into the so-called moment magnitude Mw: 

 

Mw =2/3 · log10 M0 – 10.73

The  mb  and  MS  magnitudes  in  CMT  are  given  as  reported  by  other  agencies 
(usually,  NEIC  or  ISC)  to  the  date  of  centroid-moment  tensor  solution.  Therefore, 
near all of them present preliminary estimates released by NEIC as Quick Earthquake 
Determinations  subject  to  revision  in  the  final  NEIC  GHDB. 
  Under  the 
circumstances we do not consider these magnitudes and use Mw as the CMT primary 
measure of seismic event size. 

Fig. 5 displays the temporal evolution of the annual number of earthquakes of 
different  magnitude  ranges  of  Mw.  Apparently,  starting  from  1976  the  data  on 
earthquakes  with  Mw  ≥  6.0  are  reasonably  complete  and  homogeneous.  From  1977 

6

 

 

the magnitude level of completeness rises to 5.5 and approximates to 5.0 after mid-
1990ies.  The  analysis  of  the  frequency-depth  and  depth-time  distributions  reveals 
patterns similar to those observed in NEIC for mb. Thus the analysis based on CMT 
Mw  will  involve  earthquakes  in  1977-2004  from  all  depths  and  in  the  same  depth 
ranges as defined for NEIC magnitude mb (Table 2).

2004. Different coloured lines stacked from higher ranges provide the number of earthquakes above a 
certain magnitude threshold with the step of 0.5 magnitude.

Fig. 6 represents the empirical cumulative annual average FM distributions of 
the mb, MS, and Mw in 1981-2004. (Specifically, the three FM distributions integrate 
the  information  presented  in  Figs  1a,  b  and  5.)  None  of  the  three  distributions  fit  a 
straight  line  on  the  entire  magnitude  range.  Apparently,  the  curves  bend  on  the  left 
due to incompleteness of data records, while on the right due to magnitude saturation. 
The  graph  for  mb  is  much  steeper  than  either  for  MS  or  Mw.  Evidently,  the 
completeness of the NEIC data on mb and MS is better than that of the CMT Mw. For 

7

 

 

obvious reasons the number of mb determinations is about ten times larger than those 
of MS or Mw.  

Table  2  summarises  information  of  the  data  being  used  in  present  work  for 

temporal analysis.

Finally  let  us  explore  in  brief  the  question  of  using  the  magnitude  of  mixed 
type  in  temporal  analysis  of  seismic  activity.  For  example,  Mmax  defined  as  the 
maximum of all (or selected) values of magnitudes presented in NEIC may be useful 
in  some  applications.  Such  a  composite  magnitude  allows  bypassing 
the 
incompleteness of the MS–type scale at low magnitudes and the saturation of the mb–
type  scale  at  high  magnitudes.  On  the  other  hand  the  temporal  behaviour  of  Mmax 
critically  depends  on  the  time  homogeneity  and  stability  of  primary  magnitudes.  In 
case of piecewise or unstable data (that is usual for seismic catalogues) Mmax switches 
from one magnitude type to another depending on their presence in the catalogue. The 
difference in magnitude scales (see Fig. 6) may result in hectic temporal variations not 
related to the actual seismic activity (for an example, see Fig. 7). It is rather evident 
that before 1993 the contributions of the four  magnitudes mb, MS, M3, and  M4 into 
the  cumulative  number  of  events  with  5.5  ≤  Mmax  ≤  6.0  were  proportional.  The 
proportion  did  break  into  a  new  one  after  the  moment  magnitudes  were  introduced 
and  eventually  became  dominant  contributors  to  the  values  of  Mmax.  Similar  graphs 
are obtained for higher 0.5-magnitude bins. The analysis of the man-made changes in 
NEIC  and  other  seismic  data  is  interesting  but  lies  outside  the  scope  of  the  present 
paper.  Hereinafter  we  rely  on  persistent  procedures  of  magnitude  determinations  at 
seismic stations contributing to average values of mb and MS.

5.5  ≤  Mmax  ≤  6.0.  Different  coloured  lines  represent  events  with  Mmax  equals  mb,  MS,  M3  or  M4 
correspondingly.

Temporal analysis of the global frequency-magnitude-depth 
distribution 

Thus, to investigate the temporal behaviour of the global seismic activity we 
analyse  the  variations  of  frequency-magnitude  distribution  computed  in  the  four 
consecutive layers of depth. The analysis is based on the data from global catalogues 
summarised in Table 2. All earthquakes are considered without fore-, main- and after-
shock discriminations. The geographical coordinates are not taken into account. The 
origin time, magnitude and depth of the earthquakes is the only information in use.  

 

NEIC, mb. 
Frequency-time  distributions  of  earthquakes  of  different  magnitude 
ranges  in  the  four  intervals  of  depth,  i.e.,  0-100  km,  100-300  km,  300-500  km  and 
500-700 km, are presented in Fig. 8. Note that in each particular graph the points from 
different  colour  lines  at  a  given  time  represent  the  annual  FM  distribution  of  the 
Global  seismic  activity.  Given  frequency  in  logarithmic  scale,  the  uniform  distance 
between  adjacent  lines  corresponds  to  the  linear  FM  distribution,  i.e.,  to  the 
Gutenberg-Richter  power  law.  The  power-law  exponent  b  can  be  derived  from  the 
value  of  this  distance.  Thus,  by  inspection  of  the  graphs  in  Fig.  8  one  can  analyse 
temporal  variations  of  the  FM  distribution,  in  particular,  its  slope  and  form.  The 
following observations appear to be evident. 

The  behaviour  of  the  FM  graphs  before  1995  is  quite  similar  for  all  depths. 
The global seismic activity is rather stable and coherent at least above mb = 5.0 (while 
lower  magnitudes  are  visibly  incomplete).  One  may  notice  a  short  acceleration  of 
activity in the mid-sixties apparently associated with the two greatest earthquakes in 
Alaska  (1964)  and  Aleutian  Islands  (1965).  During  the  following  30  years  FM 
distributions are close to straight lines in magnitude range from 5.0 to 6.0.  At shallow 
and  intermediate  depths  these  lines  curve  downwards  at  magnitudes  above  6.0.  The 
occurrences  of  strong  earthquakes  seem  irregular.  After  1995  a  significant 
rearrangement  of  the  FM  distributions  can  be  observed.  It  develops  throughout  the 
whole lithosphere but in a slightly different way for different depths. 

At  shallow  depths  it  starts  with  the  descent  of  moderate  and  strong 
earthquakes  rates  in  1996-1998,  followed  with  acceleration,  and  continues  in  2000-
2004 with a steady rate and near uniform distance between neighbouring lines of the 
graph  for  all  magnitudes  mb  ≥  4.5.  Thus,  the  beginning  of  the  21st  century  is 
characterised with the general straightening of the global FM distribution at shallow 
depths mainly due to the increase of the strong earthquake rate. 

For  depths  100-300  km  and  300-500  km  after  1995  the  noticeable  gradual 
diminution of seismic rate in the moderate magnitude range from 5.0 to 6.0 juxtaposes 
with the steady background rates of smaller and larger events. Such behaviour implies 
the convexity of the FM graph in its central part. 

The  FM  graph  at  the  ultra-deep  layer  after  the  1994  shows  a  drastic 
redistribution of the seismic activity. Specifically, it comprises the evident growth of 
activity at mb ≥ 6.5 ranges with the decrease of activity at moderate magnitudes from 
6.4 to 5.0. These features correspond to the lowing down of the central part of the FM 
curve with its tail rising up. 

Thus, from the viewpoint of mb frequency-magnitude distribution, during the 
first three decades or more of the period considered the global seismic activity follows 
rather  steady  process  at  all  depths,  then  starting  from  about  the  mid-1990ies  the 
evident  transformation  of  the  global  seismic  regime  has  occurred.  It  appears  as 
gradual change of the global FM graphs from concave to convex. The most significant 
change occurred in the ultra-deep layer, below 500 km.

Fig.  9  illustrates  these  observations  with  the  empirical  annual  average  FM 
distributions computed in the three 12-years intervals that subdivide 1969-2004, i.e., 
1969-1980, 1981-1992, and 1993-2004. To facilitate cross comparison the graphs are 
given  in  pairs  presented  on  the  two  plates.  The  first  plate  (Fig.  9a)  shows  the  very 
similar  behaviour  at  all  depths  in  the  first  and  the  second  intervals.  The  fit  is  rather 
impressive:  the  empirical  FM  curves  have  close  slopes  of  the  linear  parts,  indicate 
near equal levels of completeness, while differ by general levels of activity. Naturally, 
the  shallow  layer  is  the  most  active,  followed  by  the  intermediate  and  ultra  deep 
populations  of  earthquake.  The  layer  between  300  and  500  km  is  the  quietest.  The 
order is in accordance with the differential graphs presented in Fig. 3 above. For each 
specific  depth  the  G-R  graphs  in  1969-1980  and  1981-1992  might  be  considered  as 
almost identical. On the contrary, the third period reveals noticeably different form of 
the FM curves, especially, for intermediate, deep and ultra deep earthquakes (Fig. 9b). 
The lowing down of the central part of the FM curves around mb=5.0 is in common at 
all depths. Besides that in upper, ultra-deep and, perhaps, in deep layers the FM curve 
tails rise up.

To  study  the  intermediate-term  dynamics  of  the  FM  distribution  curves  we 
analyse  temporal  variations  of  their  slope,  coefficient  b,  evaluated  on  consecutive 
segments of the magnitude range. Specifically, the linear fit approximation is used: 

 

 

b = (log10(N(M1))-log10(N(M2))/ΔM,   

(2) 
 
where N(Mi) is the number of events with magnitude Mi and above, ΔM=M2-M1=0.5. 
Trailing intervals of 6 years shifted by 6 months are considered. The accepted 6-years 
duration is large enough to guarantee abundant statistics of earthquakes and is small 
enough to resolve the observable intermediate-term variations within the 36 years of 
the catalogue available.  Besides that such span has given a good account of itself in 
the  on-going  real-time  earthquake  prediction  experiment  (Kossobokov  et  al.  1999; 
Romashkova & Kossobokov, 2005). The results for the specified depths are presented 
in Fig. 10. Note that the tick-marks on abscissa point at the end of 6-year intervals, so 
that  the  ordinates  indicate  b-value  to-date.  For  example,  the  b-values  at  January  1, 
2000 is computed from the earthquake populations in the period from January 1, 1994 
through December 31, 1999.

See text for detailed description.  
 
The results summarised in Fig. 10 can be described as follows: 
•  Depths  0-100  km.  In  the  first  two  decades  of  the  analysis  the  FM  curve  is 
essentially concave with the b-value changing gradually from b≈0.6 at magnitudes 
mb=4.5-5.0 (violet line) up to b above 2.0 at mb=6.0-6.5 (red line). The values of 
b about 0.6 are apparently due to certain incompleteness of data at low magnitude 
ranges  in  the  first  decades.  The  extreme  values  of  b  above  2.0  characterise  the 
small number of strong, mb  ≥ 6.0 events and fast saturation of the FM plots that 
involve  an  mb-type  scale.  For  magnitudes  mb=5.0-5.5  (green  line)  b≈1.3  and 
remains  stable  during  the  whole  period.  For  mb=5.5-6.0  (blue  line)  the  b-value 
declines  from  b≈1.5  starting  at  1995  or  earlier  and  reaches  the  level  of  b≈1.3  in 
2002, since which time the FM curve fits a near straight line  for mb=5.0-6.0.  In 
general, after 2000 the whole FM curve tends to straighten up with its central part, 
b≈1.35.  

•  Depths  100-300  km.  The  FM  curve  starts  from  the  concave  form  with  some 
periods of linearity at segment of moderate magnitudes (green and blue lines) with 
a  common  b-value  about  1.4.  The  tail  of  the  FM  curve  at  large  mb  values  (red 
line)  is  rather  unstable  due  to  the  small  sample  statistics  and  goes  up  and  down 
frequently.  Starting  from  2000  the  FM  curve  becomes  convex  for  mb=4.5-6.0, 
with b≈1.2 for mb=5.0-5.5. The tails of the FM curve at extreme values of mb do 
not rise.  

12

 

 

•  Depths 300-500 km. Due to deficiency of data the FM curve is unstable at high 
magnitudes,  while  at  moderate  magnitudes  (green  and  blue  lines)  it  looks  pretty 
linear up to 2001 although with the common slope varying between 1.5 and 1.0. 
The  lower  segment  (violet  line)  has  similar  slope  from  the  early  1990ies.  After 
2001 the FM curve is evidently convex with the b-value changing from b≈1.5 at 
low magnitudes to b≈0.7 at high magnitudes. 

•  Depths 500-700 km. Through the early 1990ies the FM curve appears essentially 
concave with the slope b≈1.5 at mb=5.0-5.5, then it gradually straightens up and 
becomes convex after 2001 with the slope varying from b≈1.5 at low to b≈0.6 at 
high values of mb. 

 
Thus, one may conclude that starting from about late nineties the FM curves 
based on mb attributed to intermediate, deep and ultra-deep earthquakes change their 
form from concave to convex within the magnitude range from 4.5 to 6.0, or even 6.5 
in ultra-deep layer. For earthquakes from the upper layer general straightening of the 
FM curve is observed.

Tables  3  and  4  summarise  the  time  behaviour  of  the  FM  curve  for  moderate 
magnitude  range  mb=5.0-6.0.  Specifically  Table  3  gives  the  consecutive  ten-year 
averages and standard deviations of the b-values determined by formula (2) for each 
of the four layers of depth. The overlapping six-year periods shifted by half-year are 
used for the b-value estimates. Tables 3 suggests that the average b-values in the first 
two  decades  are  close  to  each  other,  while  those  in  the  third  decade,  i.e.,  in  1995-
2004, differ significantly from the two previous (being separated by 2.1-3.5 standard 
deviations). It concerns most of all the deep and ultra-deep earthquake populations. 

 
 

 

13

 

 

 

 
 
 

Table 4 provides the consecutive ten-year averages and standard deviations of 

the parameter CON determined as follows: 

 
CON(M1, M2) = log10N((M1+M2)/2) – (log10N(M1) + log10N(M2))/2       (3) 
 
in  the  same  time  windows  as  the  b-value  estimates.  The  parameter  CON  represents 
some measure of deviation of the FM curve from the straight line at the middle of the 
magnitude interval considered. The positive CON-values indicate concave form of the 
curve, while the negative – convex form. Table 4 suggests gradual change of the FM 
curve from concave to straight line in the upper and intermediate layers or to convex 
in the deep and ultra-deep layers.  

Thus, a general conclusion can be drawn: Starting from the mid- nineties the 
global  mb-based  FM  distribution  of  earthquakes  has  experienced  the  qualitative 
transformation:  In  the  upper-depth  layer  it  appears  as  general  straightening  of  the 
FM  curve,  while  in  the  intermediate,  deep  and  ultra-deep  ones  it  changes  the  FM 
curve from concave to convex. The first is a result of the gradual increase of the rate 
of  the  strong  (mb  ≥  6.5)  shallow  earthquakes,  while  the  second  starts  with  the 
decrease  of  the  rate  of  moderate  (5.0  ≤  mb  <  6.0)  earthquakes  in  the  early  nineties, 
and follows by the rise of the rate of strong earthquakes. 
 

NEIC, MS 
Fig.  1b  shows  the  evolution  of  the  annual  rate  of  earthquakes  from 
different  ranges  of  MS.  Since  only  a  few  events  deeper  than  50  km  hold  an  MS 
determination in NEIC the curves for shallow events are very close. One may grasp a 
similar  pattern  in  the  behaviour  of  the  curves  as  the  one  observed  with  mb  data  at 
shallow  depths  in  1995-2004.  In  fact,  the  pattern  of  gradual  increase  of  the  strong 
earthquake rate on the background of stable or reduced rate of moderate earthquakes, 
resulting  a  near  equal  distance  between  different  colour  lines  on  the  graph,  is  even 
more evident for MS data. As demonstrated above for mb-based plots, such behaviour 
corresponds to the straightening of the FM curve owing to the rise of the curve tail. 
The effect for MS is clearly observed in Fig. 11.

periods.

Fig. 12 displays the intermediate-term dynamics of the b-value of the MS FM 
curve  (computed  in  the  same  way  as  for  mb)  for  several  magnitude  segments  with 
ΔM=1.0. The observed focusing of all b-value curves into a narrow beam after 2001 
evidences the straight-line type of the FM distribution over the wide range of MS from 
5.0  to  8.0.  The  common  b-value  is  close  to  0.8.  Note  that  such  pattern  is  rather 
atypical  for  MS  data:  in  the  period  considered  it  covers  less  than  15%  of  the  total. 
Usually  the  FM  curve  looks  either  concave,  as  in  1982-2000,  or  near  linear  with  a 
steep falloff, as in 1979-1981. In the same way as in Table 3 for mb, Table 5 sums up 
the  b-values  observed  in  the  three  magnitude  segments  of  the  MS  FM  curve  and 
consecutive  5-year  periods.  The  FM  slopes  of  the  first  and  the  second  magnitude 
segments are rather stable, varying about b=0.74 for MS=5.0-6.0 and about b=0.88 for 
MS  =6.0-7.0.  According  to  Figs  1b  and  4,  moderate  MS  data  might  be  incomplete 
before  1980,  which  implies  a  relative  underestimation  of  the  b-values.  The  slope  at 
MS=7.0-8.0  has  changed  in  the  past  30  years  from  1.66  to  0.87;  the  main  falloff 
occurred in the last five (possibly, ten) years.

Thus,  the  analysis  of  the  MS  determinations  contributes  to  the  conclusion 
derived above from the mb ones: The last decade is marked with a general increase in 
the  rate  of  the  major  MS  ≥  7.0  earthquakes  world-wide  on  the  background  of 
stationary rate at moderate magnitude ranges; after 2001 the Gutenberg-Richter plot 
is linear with b≈0.8 over the entire range of reliable values of MS from 5.0 to 8.0.

Similar  to  Fig.  9,  Fig.  13  displays  the  FM  curves  computed  from  the 
CMT, MW 
CMT MW data in the two consecutive 12-year periods. A substantial uplift of the FM 
curve at high values of MW in the second period is evident for the upper and ultra-deep 
layers. Some sagging of the FM plot at moderate values of MW can be recognised for 
earthquakes from deep and, more clearly, from ultra-deep layers.  
 

Figure  13.  Annually  averaged  frequency-magnitude  distributions  for  Mw  calculated  for  two  of 
consecutive  time  periods:  1981-1992  (thin  lines)  and  1993-2004  (solid  lines).  Different  colours 
represent different depth bands 

Figure 14. Time variations of b-value of Mw FM curves calculated for different depth bands: (a) 0-100 
km;  (b)  300-700km.  Different  coloured  lines  correspond  to  the  different  magnitude  segments  of  FM 
curves. Time axis ticks mark the end of 6 years sliding interval. 
 

Fig.  14  shows  the  intermediate-term  dynamics  of  the  b-value  of  the  MW  FM 
plots determined in the two layers: shallow depth down to 100 km and deep from 300 
to 700 km (due to a small number of earthquakes with reported MW in ultra-deep layer 
it is considered together with the deep one). As could be judged from the figure, the 
MW FM curve for shallow earthquakes fits a straight line at MW=5.5-7.0 through the 
entire period of analysis. The b-value is close to 1.0, following the original moment 
magnitude  scale  definition  (Kanamory,  1977)  up  to  high  values,  where  the  MW  FM 
curve has a falloff, which slope is not steady. The MW scale saturation for major and 
great shallow earthquakes might be attributed to the limited width of Earth crust that 
implies  changing  earthquake  source  geometry  around  M0=1027.2  dyne·cm  (Okal  & 
Romanowicz, 1994). As a result the MW FM curve is expected to band from b=1.0 to 

16

 

 

 

 

b=1.5 at MW about 7.4. In our analysis the b-value average of the MW FM curve for 
shallow earthquakes at MW=7.0-8.0 over 1983-1997 equals 1.6, and it drops to about 
1.2 in 1998-2004. This is an evidence of straightening of the FM curve from 1998 on.  
In  1983-1985,  the  FM  curve  for  deep  earthquakes  is  visibly  banded  at 
MW=6.5-7.0,  while  in  1986-2002  it  is  close  to  a  straight  line  with  a  varying  b-value 
between 0.7 and 1.0; then, starting from 2003, the curve becomes convex, uplifted at 
high values with the b-value approaching 0.5.  

Thus,  similar  to  mb  and  MS  scales,  the  analysis  of  the  MW  data  shows  that 
recently the global MW frequency-magnitude distribution for shallow earthquakes has 
transformed towards a straight line and has become convex for deep and ultra-deep 
ones.   

The two corollary evidences 

Our analysis of global seismic activity shows its intermediate-term variability 
including  significant  deviations  from  quasi-stationary  regime  and  qualitative 
conversions  of  the  frequency-magnitude  distributions,  which  could  be  viewed  as 
characteristic  anomalies.  The  observed  anomalies  did  appear  recently,  after  1994  or 
later.  They  developed  coherently  throughout  the  lithosphere  depths  and  had  similar 
manifestations when different magnitude scales are considered. This suggests natural 
inferences on the character of the global processes in the lithosphere of the Earth.  
 (1) 
The  observed  temporal  variations  of  the  FM  curves  at  different  depths 
evidence the global redistribution of seismic energy release in the lithosphere during 
the last years. Specifically, besides the general increase of the total number of largest 
earthquakes  world-wide,  a  considerable  imbalance  in  the  ratio  between  deep  and 
shallow  earthquake  rates  has  occurred  at  that  time.  One  can  see  (Fig.  15)  that  after 
1994, and especially after 2002, the ratio of the largest, mb ≥ 6.5, ultra-deep events 
total to that of the shallow ones (violet line) increases sizeably. The ratio reaches its 
maximum  21%  in  2003  at  which  time  it  exceeds  average  level  of  4.1%  registered 
before 1994 by a factor of five. On the contrary, in the last years the ratio calculated 
for the moderate, mb ≥ 5.0, earthquakes (green lines) decreases steadily from 6% to 
3%. Similar behaviour of the ratios is obtained for depths from 300 to 700 km. 

Figure  15.  Time  variation  of  ratio  (in  %)  of  the  ultra-deep  (500-700  km)  to  upper-deep  (0-100  km) 
earthquake  number  in  NEIC.  Different  coloured  lines  provide  ratio  for  earthquakes  above  a  certain 
magnitude threshold mb. (Notes: 1) The calculations are performed using the trailing 6-year windows. 
2) The observed sexennial averages of ultra-deep events of magnitude 6.5, 6.0, 5.5 and 5.0 or larger are 
3, 15, 70 and 365, correspondingly,  while  those  of  shallow  depth  earthquakes  are 31,  292,  1603 and 
7039.) 

17

 

 

As  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  15  there  is  another  period,  1975-1976,  featuring 
similar, although not so vivid, imbalance in the ratio. The character of this deviation is 
uncertain  due  to  the  short  truncated  span  of  the  pattern:  it  may  be  either  a  short 
fluctuation in seismic distribution or a final, decaying part of the global rise of seismic 
activity in the middle of the 20th century. Note that these two periods differ a lot in 
the form of the FM distributions presented earlier in Fig. 10. 

Figure  16.  Distribution  of  ratio  (in  %)  of  the  ultra-deep  (500-700  km)  to  upper-deep  (0-100  km) 
earthquake  number,  mb  ≥  6.5,  among  regions.  Different  coloured  bands  provide  contributions  of 
different regions: SAm – South America, NWP – north-west Pacific, SEA – south-west Asia, SWP – 
south-west Pacific.  
 

Fig.  16  investigates  whether  the  observed  pattern  is  of  global  nature  by 
presenting the break-down of the ratio in proportion to the contributions from the four 
regions  of  deep  earthquakes  with  hypocenter  depths  of  500  km  or  more.    These 
regions  are:  (i)  South  America,  Sam;  (ii)  North-West  Pacific,  NWP,  including 
Kamchatka,  Kuril  islands,  Japan  and  Bonin-Mariana  trench;  (iii)  South-East  Asia, 
SEA,  including  Indonesia  and  Philippine  islands;  (iv)  South-West  Pacific,  SWP, 
including Tonga-Kermadec trench, and New Guinea. In fact an increase of the ultra-
deep earthquake activity usually arise from one or two individual regions. It was so 
for  a  long  time  up  to  1994.  Then  three  regions,  in  different  combinations,  were 
showing up and after 2002 to the present the ultra-deep seismic activity spreads over 
all the four regions, each of which gives more or less equal contribution to the total 
(SAm  –  2,  NWP  –  1,  SEA  –  2,  SWP  –  2  events  in  6  years).  Thus,  it  is  possible  to 
conclude that (i) the redistribution of seismic energy release at depths occurred in the 
last decade is the global-scale one, and (ii) it combines the correlated worldwide rise 
of the ultra-deep activity manifested by great earthquakes with a relative reduction of 
the background seismic rate at shallow depths. 
(2) 
Another  conclusion  is  pertinent  to  the  cross-relations  between  different 
magnitude scales suggesting that these relations reveal a qualitative change in the last 
decade.  

We have analysed the intermediate-term variations of the difference between 
MW and mb (or MS) scales for shallow (0-50 km) and deep (300-700 km) earthquakes 
separately.  The  average  difference  between  MW  and  either  mb  or  MS  has  been 
calculated for moderate earthquakes (mb ≥ 5.0, MS ≥ 5.0) from consequent magnitude 
bins  ΔMW=0.5  within  sliding  6-year  interval.  The  temporal  variations  of  the 
differences are shown in Fig. 17. From 1984 and up to 1995 MW – mb for shallow (a) 
and  deep  (b)  earthquakes  and  magnitude  range  5.5-7.0  (blue,  red  and  violet  lines) 
appears to indicate validity of a linear approximation MW = C1 · mb + C2 with C1 > 1. 
Much  larger  values  of  the  difference  for  earthquakes  with  mb  =  7.0  or  more  (sea-

green line) are due to the well-known saturation of the mb-scale. The variation of MW 
– mb and even its values are very similar in the two depth ranges. Fig. 17b evidences 
transformation of the graphs after 1995. On the background of steady rise of the 5.5-
6.0  graph  from  its  minimum  in  1988  to  the  maximum  in  2002,  the  transformation 
starts  with  the  6.0-6.5  graph  moving  down  in  1995,  then,  in  2001,  follows  with  the 
6.5-7.0 graph moving also down and eventually crossing the 6.0-6.5 graph. Thus, the 
three graphs converge and C1 approaches 1 from about 2002. On the contrary, shallow 
earthquakes preserve the linear relationship after 1995 (Fig. 17a), which varies slowly 
in the longer-term.   
 

 
Figure 17.  Temporal variations of the average difference between Mw and other magnitudes: a) Mw – 
mb, shallow events, b) Mw – mb, deep events, c) Mw – Ms, shallow events. Different coloured lines 
correspond  to  the  different  magnitude  bins  of  Mw.  Time  axis  ticks  mark  the  end  of  6  years  sliding 
interval.  
 
Similar to that the difference MW – MS available for shallow earthquakes only 
shows up the validity of a linear approximation MW = C1 · MS + C2 with C1 < 1 in the 
MS  magnitude  range  5.5-7.0  (Fig.  17c).  For  the  strongest,  7.0-9.0,  earthquakes  (sea-
green  line)  the  graph  is  not  much  in  line  with  the  others  until  2003  when  it  dives 
below  0  resulting  the  linear  approximation  valid  trough  the  entire  magnitude  range 
considered, i.e., 5.5-9.0. 

Thus, it is possible to conclude that the qualitative transformation of the cross-
relations  between  different  magnitude  scales  took  place  globally  during  the  last 
decade or even few years.  

Discussion and conclusions 
The  variations  of  the  global  seismicity  were  subject  of  constant  interest  of 
seismologists  at  all  times  (Benioff  1951;  Mogi  1979;  Romanowicz  1993;  Bufe  & 
Perkins  2005).  Usually  researches  exploit  different  concepts  of  seismic  cycle  and 
succeed observing some global scale patterns in seismic energy release over decades.

The  general  global  approach  to  the  Earth  seismic  dynamics  naturally  arises 
from the conception of the Earth lithosphere as a complex non-linear dynamic system 
consisting  of  hierarchy  of  interacting  different-scale  blocks  (Keilis-Borok,  1990, 
2002;  Keilis-Borok  &  Soloviev,  2003).  The  lithosphere  as  a  whole  represents  an 
ultimate member of this hierarchy. Seismic activity is a manifestation of its internal 
processes,  most  of  which  remain  “invisible”  to  geoscientists.  Accordingly,  each 
mega-earthquake represents an extreme critical event of the manifestation. The results 
of  present  study  demonstrate  that  the  lithosphere  does  behaves  in  a  way  typical  for 
such  systems  and  reveals  classical  symptoms  of  instability  in  advance  the  2004 
Sumatra-Andaman mega-earthquake, at least at the intermediate-term scale of years. 
These  symptoms,  systematically  explored,  depicted  by  different  patterns  of  seismic 
activity and tested for earthquake prediction purposes by many authors, are based on 
(i)  variation  of  seismic  activity,  (ii)  its  redistribution  in  space,  (iii)  changes  in 
frequency-magnitude  distribution,  (iv)  cross-relations  between  different  magnitude 
scales, and (v) range of spatial and temporal correlation. 

The  present  work  demonstrates  primarily  rise  of  the  global  rate  of  strong 
earthquakes in the last decade, which has induced upward bending of the frequency-
magnitude  graph  at  the  highest  values  for  all  magnitude  scales  and  all  depths. 
Moreover,  this  rise  is  accompanied  by  a  relative  drop  in  the  rate  of  moderate 
earthquakes at depths below 100 km in particular. Such a drop could be recognised as 
precursory  quiescence.  Therefore,  the  global  seismic  activity  in  the  last  decade 
illustrates  that  both  premonitory  patterns  may  coexist  in  time  and  space  when 
definitions of rise and quiescence refer to different magnitude ranges (or scales). The 
coexistence  of  rise  and  drop  of  activity  were  not  the  same  at  different  depths  that 
results the coherent world-wide redistribution of seismic energy release.  

The  observed  changes  of  the  global  frequency-magnitude  graphs  are  in  line 
with  predictive  modelling  and  laboratory  experiments  aimed  at  better  understanding 
of fractures and fracturing (Scholz, 1968; Smith, 1981; Knopoff et al., 1982; Meredith 
et  al.,  1990;  Molchan  &  Dmitrieva,  1990;  Barenblatt,  1993;  Narkunskaya  & 
Shnirman, 1994). In particular, similar premonitory phenomena have been recognized 
by Rotwain et al. (1997) who (i) noted that in laboratory the break up of a sample is 
preceded by transition from active formation of new micro-cracks to their coalescence 
or expansion into macro- or even major-cracks and (ii) reported such a transformation 
of  seismic  activity  in  Southern  California.  In  terms  of  the  frequency-magnitude 
relation the observed changes mean that at the first stage b-value increases at smaller 
magnitudes then drops at larger magnitudes. This results in the central part of the FM 
graph  going  down  and  shaping  the  entire  graph  concave.  The  same  behaviour  has 
been  demonstrated  in  the  present  study  for  global  deep  and  ultra-deep  seismicity  a 
decade prior to the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman mega-earthquake.  

Cross-relations  between  different  magnitude  scales  are  closely  related  to  the 
earthquake  source  geometry  and  physical  properties  of  its  environment.  It  is  of 
common knowledge that mb is measured at about 1 s, MS - at 20 s (Aki & Richards, 
1980), and MW – presumably (but not necessarily) through all periods. For mb and MS 
this results into the magnitude scale saturation at high values when earthquake source 
linear size exceeds wave-length used for the magnitude determination. The difference 
of definitions allows using the routine determinations of magnitudes for estimation of 
the  source  spectral  content  (Keilis-Borok,  1960;  Prosorov  &  Hudson,  1974).  The 
analysis  of  the  MS  –  mb  statistic  (Kaveraina  et  al.,  1996)  allowed  a  conclusion  that 
predominance of high frequencies in the source spectrum is connected with relatively 
small earthquake source size and shot duration of rupture process, which may indicate 

20

 

 

high level of tectonic stress and relatively low temperature of the source environment. 
The  saturation  of  MW  for  shallow  earthquakes  is  likely  related  to  earthquake  source 
geometry (Okal & Romanowicz, 1994). All these considerations permit hypothesising 
that  temporal  changes  of  cross-relations  between  different  magnitude  scales 
apparently  reflect  physical  changes  in  the  lithosphere,  and  may  indicate  either 
approach to the critical point or stable state of the system.  

Many dynamic systems show up coherent behavior at the approach of extreme 
event  (Thom,  1975;  Prigogine  &  Stengers,  1984),  which  could  be  expressed  in 
increase  of  correlation  range.  The  concept  of  “long-range  correlation”  was 
introduced in seismology by A. Prozorov (1975) when he examined remote, so-called 
“long-range  aftershocks”  of  major  earthquakes  as  indicators  of  the  future  ones’ 
location.  Other  examples  of long-range correlation include premonitory wide-spread 
occurrence  of  near-simultaneous  earthquakes  (Shebalin  et  al.,  2000)  and  rise  of 
seismic  activity  in  sufficiently  large  number  of  fault  zones  (Zaliapin  et  al,  2002).  A 
convincing demonstration of precursory collective behavior of seismic activity over a 
large area before strong earthquakes is given by real-time applications of earthquake 
prediction  algorithms  (Kossobokov  et  al.  1999;  Rotwain  &  Novikova,  1999;  Keilis-
Borok  &  Soloviev,  2003).  The  algorithms  make  use  of  a  whole  series  of  seismic 
patterns that arise coherently within an area of linear size 5-10 times the size of target 
earthquake. As has been shown above, the lithosphere as a whole reveals patterns of 
collective  behaviour  a  decade  before  the  2004  Sumatra-Andaman  mega-earthquake. 
These  global  scale  patterns  are  similar  to  those  detected  earlier  on  a  regional  scale 
before many great, major, and strong earthquakes. 

The results of our study suggest (i) the presence of global scale intermediate-
term  tectonic  processes  in  the  lithosphere;  (ii)  the  occurrence  of  the  global  scale 
seismicity  patterns  implying  criticality  in  the  last  decade.  The  December  26,  2004 
Sumatra-Andaman  mega-earthquake  may  represent  either  the  culmination  or  one  of 
the successive stages of such a process in the last decade. A better understanding of 
the  problem  could  be  achieved  in  comparative  analysis  of  geophysical  environment 
preceding and following other greatest earthquakes. Note that in our study we did not 
investigate  short-term  characteristics  of  the  global  seismic  activity.  Neither  did  we 
consider  other  than  splitting  by  depth  possibilities  of  spatial  break-down.  Both 
deserve  consideration  in  further  research.  General  studies  aimed  at  finding  typical 
features for damped stages of critical phenomena distinct to local slowdowns of on-
going  process  may  facilitate  such  understanding.  In  case  of  extreme  seismic  events, 
geophysical  data  other  than  seismic  catalogues  could  be  useful  and  may  become 
critical  for  understanding  the  physics  of  the  global  processes  occurring  in  the  Earth 
interior  and,  eventually,  may  help  predicting  seismic  catastrophes  like  mega-
earthquakes.

 Gravitational effects produced by ELF electromagnetic radiation upon the electric current in
a  conductor are studied. It is demonstrated that flux from high  power density ELF  radiation
will cause transitory interruptions in electric current conduction.

1. INTRODUCTION

          In  a  recent  paper1  we  have
gm ,
shown that the gravitational mass, 
and the inertial mass,
im , are correlated
by  a  dimensionless      factor,  which
depends  on  the  incident(or  emitted)
the  particle.  The
radiation  upon 
general  expression  of  correlation  can
be written as:

where  D   is  the  power  density  of  the
incident( or emitted) radiation;  f  is the
frequency  of  the  radiation;  a   is  the
area  of  the  surface  of  the  particle  of
im ;  m   and  s   are  respectively,

body , the incident(or emitted) radiation
upon  the    atom  will  be  propagating
inside  the  body  ,  and  consequently  ,

          In  this  paper,  we  will  study  the
gravitational  effects  of  ELF  radiation
upon  the  electric  current  through  a
conductor.

2. THEORY

 

I 

          Let  us  consider  an  electric
current 
through  a  conductor
submitted  to  ELF  radiation        with
power density   D  and  frequency   f   .
          Under  these  circumstances  the
gem   of  the  free
gravitational  mass 
electrons  (electric  current),  according
to Eq.[1], is given by

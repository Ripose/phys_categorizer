Abstract

Room  temperature  IH-type  drift  tube  structures  are
used at different places now for the acceleration of ions
with  mass  over  charge  ratios  up  to  65  and  velocities
between 0.016 c and 0.1 c. These structures have a high
shunt  impedance  and  allow  the  acceleration  of  very
intense  beams  at  high  accelerating  gradients.  The
overall  power  consumption  of  room  temperature  IH-
mode  structures  is  comparable  with  superconducting
(sc)  structures  up  to  2  MeV/u.  With  the  KONUS  [1]
beam  dynamics,  the  required    transversal  focusing
elements, e.g. quadrupole triplets can be placed outside
of multicell cavities, which is favourable for building sc
H-mode 
and
consequences  to  the  geometry  compared  to  room
temperature (rt) cavities will be  described.  The  results
gained  from  numerical  simulations  show  that  a  sc
multi-gap  H21(0)-mode  cavity  (CH-type)  can  be  an
alternative  to  the  sc  spoke-type  or  reentrant  cavity
structures up to beam energies around 150 MeV/u. The
main cavity parameters and possible fabrication options
will be discussed.

1  INTRODUCTION

Linacs  based  on  rt  H-mode  cavities  (RFQ  and  drift
tube  structures)  are  used  today  in  the  velocity  range
from  β=0.002  up  to  β=0.1.  RF  power  tests  show  the
capability  of  IH-cavities  to  stand  about  25  MV/m  on-
axis  field.  Beside  these  high  accelerating  gradients  H-
mode  cavities  allow  the  acceleration  of  intense  beams
[2]. One aspect of the investigations started at GSI and
IAP  is  to  extend  the  velocity  range  of  the  H-mode
cavities up to β=0.5 by using the H21(0) or CH-mode.

 Many  future  projects  (the  Accelerator  Driven
Transmutation  Project  ADTP[3], 
the  European
Spallation  Source  ESS[4]  or  the  Heavy  Ion  Inertial
Fusion  HIIF  [5])  are  based  on  the  availability  of
efficient  accelerating  cavities  with  properties  like
mentioned above, which additionally could be operated
in  cw  mode.  It  is  commonly  accepted  that  above  an
energy  of  200  MeV/u  superconducting  cavities  are
superior to rt structures.  By  combining  the  advantages
of  CH-mode 
of
superconductivity,  effective  ion  acceleration  at  high
duty  cycle  will  be  possible.  For  high  current  proton
beams  the  injection  energy  will  be  around  10  MeV,
while for heavy ions the injection energy may become

as  low  as  1  MeV/u.  The  CH-structure  is  efficient  for
beam energies up to 150 MeV/u.

This  paper  describes  the  properties  of  H-mode
cavities  and  especially  the  CH-type.  Important  is  the
application  of 
the  KONUS  beam  dynamics  [1],
resulting in long, lens free accelerating sections housed
in  individual  cavities.  This  opens  the  superconducting
option,  as 
internal
quadrupoles  cannot  be  easily  shielded  well  enough  to
avoid frozen current contributions.

The  results  from  numerical  simulations  of  three
H21(0)-type  cavities  with  different  resonant  frequencies
and  velocity  profiles  will  be  reported  and  first
mechanical construction layouts will be presented.

2  H-MODE CAVITIES

The  IH-DTL  (Interdigital  H-mode  or  H11(0))  has
become a standard solution for heavy ion acceleration.

example.  The  new  high  current  injector  at  GSI  [2,7]
consists  of  the  first  IH-DTL  designed  for  very  heavy
ions  with  A/q  =  65  including  space  charge  effects  of
considerable strength at the design current of I/emA =
0.25·A/q.  An  important  property  of  H-type  DTLs  is
their  high  acceleration  efficiency,  i.e.  they  provide  a
high  shunt  impedance,  especially  at  low  β-values  up
to 0.2.

The H210-mode is already used in accelerator physics:
the 4 vane-RFQ is well established for proton and light
ion  acceleration  [8].  A  competitive  H-mode  drift  tube
cavity in the velocity range from β = 0.05 to  0.5  may
become  the  H21(0)-mode  CH  structure,  which  can  be
deduced  from  the  4-vane  RFQ  by  cutting  down  the
vanes around the aperture and replacing the electrodes
by  drift  tubes.  These  drift  tubes  are  connected  by  two
stems  with  the  girders  of  identical  RF  potential  (see
fig. 1).  The  dipole  mode  that  usually  causes  trouble
during the tuning procedure of the 4-vane RFQ is short-
circuited  by  the  stems  along  the  whole  cavity.  The
analytically  estimated  shunt  impedance  assuming  slim
drift  tubes  without  quadrupoles  is  about  a  factor  1.4
higher  compared 
IH-cavity.  Numerical
simulations have shown that CH-cavities for resonance
frequencies up to around 800 MHz can be realised. This
allows  to  close  the  velocity  gap  between  RFQs  and
Coupled Cavity Linacs (CCL).

3  DESIGN OF A SUPERCONDUCTING

CH-CAVITY

The  CH-cavity  exceeds  by  far  the  mechanical
rigidity  of  IH-tanks.  This  opens  the  possibility  to
develop superconducting multi-cell cavities [9]. So far
only  2-  and  3-cell  sc  structures  were  realised  for  low
beam velocities.

 The  different  prototype  cavities  discussed  are
modules of an accelerator design investigated for  high
current  proton  acceleration.  The  parameters  of  these
prototype cavities are given in tab.1.

 The RF behavior of the resonators was studied with
an analytical model [10] that allows a first optimization
step  of 
the  fundamental  cavity  parameters.  The
consequent  numerical  simulations  of  the  resonators
were  done  using  the  MAFIA  package  [11].  All
parameters  predicted  with  the  analytical  model  were
confirmed by MAFIA within ±10 % deviation.

As  a  first  step  of  the  design  process,  only  two
accelerating gaps have been computed. Starting with a
rt design the drift tubes and the shape of the stems were
optimized.  Special  care  was  taken  on  the  magnetic
surface field trying to keep it well below the BCS-Limit
of  Niobium.  By  increasing  the  stem  cross  section,  the
magnetic  surface  field  could  be  reduced  by  aprox.  a
factor  of  two,  reaching  up  to  30  mT  in  the  actual
design.

This  optimization  process  caused  an  increase  in  the
capacitive  load  and  thus  lowered  the  shunt  impedance
by 20 %, which is no drawback in case of a sc cavity.
The  maximum  electric  field  (27.5  MV/m)  has  been
found at the drift tube ends.

After  this  optimization  step  the  whole  cavity  was
computed to study the impacts on the field flatness. As
the  magnetic  flux  bends  from  one  to  the  neighboring
sector  at  its  ends  (see  also  fig. 1)  one  expects  high
magnetic  surface  fields  in  this  region.  The  girder
undercuts,  used  in  rt  IH-mode  and  4-vane  cavities
successfully  to  create  the  zero  mode  are  not  the  right
choice for a sc cavity. Therefore  a careful redesign had
to be performed. The lowest surface fields were yielded
by  combining  two  modifications:  The  tank  radius  is
increased by 17 % between the end flange and the first
drift  tube  stem.  To  assure  the  field  flatness,  i.e.  a
constant  accelerating  field  along  the  whole  cavity,  the
local  capacity  at  the  cavity  ends  had  to  be  further
increased. This was attained by forming thicker stems.
As  a  measure  to  reduce  the  surface  currents  at  the
cavity end flanges, which may be sealed by an indium
joint, half drift tubes were introduced.
Figure  2  shows  the  layout  of  the  cavity.  Table  1
summarizes  the  results  of  the  simulations.  Comparing
these  parameters  to  that  of  existing  cavities  [12]
displays the potential of CH-cavities.

4  FABRICATION OPTIONS

 Up  to  now  only  two  different  options  in  fabricating

the cavity are considered:

Bmax = 38 mT

Bgirder = 20 mT

Emax = 27.5 MV/m

Bstem = 30 mT

Bflange = 4 mT

Thicker Stems

tab. 1. Also shown are some field values calculated with MAFIA, especially the maximum values of the magnetic
(38 mT at both resonator ends) and of the electric field (27.5 MV/m on the drift tube surface).

Like  it  is  done  with  the  normal  conducting  IH-
mode resonators, one fabricates the drift tubes and
the  stems  out  of  bulk  copper  mounted  inside  a
copper  plated  steel  tank.  The  deposition  of  the
superconducting surface layer is done by sputtering
with niobium. Though the behavior of thin niobium
films is well known and meet the requirements, it
might need much effort for sputtering this complex
geometry with the needed precision.  The  progress
in  this  technology  made  elsewhere  [13]  shows
however the great potential of  this option.

-  On  the  other  hand  one  can  think  of  building  the
cavity  out  of  bulk  niobium  components.  In  that
case  there  exists  a  lot  of  experience  in  electron
beam  welding.  The  first  superconducting  RFQ,
which  has  currently  past  the  cold  low  level  tests
successfully, has been built this way [14].

The  third  possibility,  namely  leadplating  a  copper
resonator  has  been  abandoned  because  of  the  limited
performance of cavities build this way, as for example
in Legnaro [15]. Even though the magnetic surface flux
of  our  resonator  is  below  the  BCS-limit  for  lead,
electric  surface  fields  of  up  to  28  MV/m  seems  to  be
beyond the limit of that technology.

5  OUTLOOK

 The  normal  conducting  H-mode  cavities  showed
their  suitability  for  ion  acceleration  at  low  energies  in
many  accelerator 
investigations
indicate that CH-mode cavities are well suited to design

laboratories.  Our 

results  of 

resonators.  The 

superconducting 
the
numerical  simulation  of  such  a  cavity  are  very
promising.  Using  state  of  the  art  technology  the
fabrication  of  a  superconducting  CH-mode  cavity
should  be  possible  [13,14].  The  design,  construction
and  rf  test  of  an  352  MHz  prototype  cavity  are
scheduled at IAP, Frankfurt University.

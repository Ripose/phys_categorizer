Abstract : We present an exact treatment of wave propagation in some inhomogeneous thin films with highly space-
dependent  dielectric  constant.  It  is  based  on  a  space  transformation  which  replaces  the  physical  space  by  the  optical 
path. In the new space, the dispersion equation is that of a normal progressive wave. We will show that the dispersion 
properties  of  such  films  are  plasma-  or  waveguide-like,  the  characteristic  frequency  being  determined  by  the  spatial 
characteristics  of  the  dielectric  constant’s  variations  only.  The  theory  is  scalable,  so  that  it  can  be  applied  in  any 
wavelength  range  :  optical,  IR,  radiofrequency,  etc.  depending  only  on  the  characteristic  space  scales.    Several 
applications will be presented, concerning the reflection properties of such films (broadband anti-reflection, or dichroic 
coatings) or to the propagation and transmission through the film. We will show that depending on the type of space 
dependence, an incident wave can either propagate or tunnel through such films. We will investigate the behaviour of 
the  light  group-velocity  and  tunneling  time  inside  or  through  such  films.  Though  we  can  reproduce  the  phase-time 
saturation corresponding to the Hartman effect, analysis of the group velocity in the tunneling case shows no sign of 
superluminal  propagation.  A  strong  frequency  dependence  can  be  obtained  in  some  situations,  which  allows  to 
anticipate a strong reshaping of brodband laser pulses.  
 

1.   INTRODUCTION 
 
The  problem  of  wave  propagation  in  media  with  rapidly  varying  dielectric  constants  has  received  attention  since  the 
early stage of electromagnetism. The first analytical results were obtained by Rayleigh for waves whose velocity inside 
the  medium  depends  linearly  upon  the  coordinate  (1).  Later  the  linear  profile  for  ε(z)(2)  -  z  being  the  direction  of 
propagation of the light - as well as an exponential and more general Epstein profiles(3) were used for the analysis of 
radio  propagation  in  the  ionosphere.  Some  more  complicated  distributions  were  modeled  by  piece-wise  profiles  of 
ε(z)(4), described by a WKB approximation(5) or treated numerically(6). These researches focused on the propagation of 
EM  waves  in  heterogeneous  media  with  positive ε,  although  the  tunneling  phenomena,  which  arise  when ε<  0,  were 
touched sometimes, e.g., in the case of radio waves percolation nearby the ionospheric maxima(7). 
 
Modern technologies now allow to realize thin films with a significant dielectric constant variation over a length of the 
order  or  even  smaller  than  visible  wavelengths.  Such  thin  films  of,  e.g.,  ZnSe  or  silicon  oxynitride,  were  shown  to 
provide  broadband  antireflection  properties  (Sankur  et  al.(8)).  Methods  for  real-time  monitoring  and  control  of  the 
growth  of  transparent  inhomogeneous  layers,  based  on  reflectometry  and  ellipsometry  of  growing  layers,  were 
elaborated  (Kildemo  et  al  (9)).  However,  the  profiles  realized  in  this  way  are  much  more  general  than  the  ones  that 
received  analytical  solutions,  and  numerical  treatments(6)  generally  fail  revealing  the  essence  of  the  physics  of  wave 
propagation in such objects. In this paper, we summarize the work we performed on this topic (10,11) which is based on 
the following strategy : 
- using profiles of ε(z) containing enough free parameters to encompass most of the general features of the films that can 
be generated (e.g. concave or convex variations of ε(z), monotonous or not) 
- the material of the film, as well as of the eventual substrate has no intrinsic dispersion, so that any observed dispersion 
will  find  its  origin  in  the  spatial  variations  of  the  dielectric  constant,  hereafter  referred  to  as  “Heterogeneity  Induced 
Dispersion” (HID)  

- relying only on analytical solutions of the wave equation (which will be obtained in a transformed space) in order to 
keep a good insight on the origin of the observed phenomena 
- though we will explicitly refer to the optical domain, the theory can be spatially scaled so that the conclusions apply to 
any field of electromagnetism  
 
The properties that we are interested in are the reflection properties of the films, as well as its transmission properties. In 
particular, we will consider the problems of tunneling through films which cannot support field propagation. Indeed the 
advent  of  lasers  attracted  attention  upon  light  tunneling  in  a  series  of  optoelectronics  problems,  such  as,  e.g.,  the 
evanescent  modes  in  dielectric  waveguides(12),  surface  waves  on  microspheres(13),  Goos  –  Hanchen  effect  for  optical 
coatings(14). A new burst of interest into these phenomena was stimulated by the intriguing perspective of superluminal 
light  propagation  through  opaque  barriers(15).  The  experiments  in  microwave  range  with  “undersized”  waveguides(16) 
and bi-prism devices(17) as well as the analysis of spatial displacement of the peak of a tunneling pulse(18) and the direct 
measurement of photons tunneling time(19,20) were considered by some authors in favor of the concept of superluminal 
phase time for the tunneling electromagnetic waves(21). However, this concept aroused controversial viewpoints(22,23).  
 
Finally, we will see that some of the studied films can present very strong dispersion properties. Obviously, and though 
we  do  not  explicitely  treat  this  problem,  this  will  induce  a  very  strong  reshaping  of  broadband  ultrashort  pulses 
propagating through such films, and could eventually offer the opportunity of manipulating their shape in a controlled 
way. 

2.  HETEROGENEITY INDUCED DISPERSION (HID) OF THIN DIELECTRIC FILMS. 
 
Let us consider an inhomogeneous dielectric film as a plane dielectric layer with thickness d and dielectric susceptibility  
ε(z),  0  ≤  z  ≤  d.  A  linearly  polarized  EM  wave,  that  we  assume  to    propagate  in  the  z-direction  (normal  incidence 
conditions), is described by Maxwell equations, linking the Ex and Hy components of the wave :

Here n0 is the refractive index value on the interface z = 0; the distribution (3) is considered in the region z ≥ 0. The 
characteristic spatial scales L1 and L2 as well as the values s1 and s2 are the free parameters of model (3). Note that the 
Rayleigh  profile  of  eq.  (1)  above  corresponds  to  the  limit  of  U(t)  when  the  scale  L2→∞.  The  EM  field  in  normal 
incidence  can  be  described  with  help  of  a  single  component  vector-potential  cast  under  the  form  A  (z,t)  =  A0  ψ(z,t), 
where ψ is a scalar function such that (for convenience, we put A0=1)

At this point, we note that solutions in the form of traveling waves are obtained only if the  expression under the radical 
is  positive.  This  is  always  the  case  if  p²<o,  i.e.  for  s2=+1,  if  L2>2L1.  In  the  opposite  case  (p²>0),  the  availability  of 
traveling wave solutions is subject to a condition concerning ω, which writes

Thus we found an exact solution describing the EM wave in an inhomogeneous layer (3). This solution can be used for 
finding the reflection coefficient of the wave, incidenting normally from the vacuum on the layer’s interface z = 0, and 
to study the propagation of tunneling of waves though such layers. 
 
 

3.  ANTIREFLEXION PROPERTIES INDUCED BY HID 
 
The  reflexion  properties  of  such  films  were  investigated  in  detail  in  (10).  We  present  here  the  essential  results  of  this 
study. In all cases we consider here a wavelength range in which propagation in the film is possible. In the case of films 
presenting a cut-off frequency condition (10) must be realized. We first illustrate the “intrinsic” properties of such films 
– considered as “self-standing” in vacuum - of different types and show their dependence on the type of profile.  
Figure 1 illustrates the case of a film with p²>0, s1>0, s2<0, y=1, n0 = 1.73 and of different thickness characterized by the 
parameter α=d/L2, where d is the film thickness. Under such conditions, with α ranging from 0.1 to 0.3, the dielectric 
constant is continuously decreasing throughout the film. Such a film possess a cut-off frequency given by :

We see that such a film has a low intensity reflection coefficient over a very large frequency range (typically less than 
5% in the frequency range Ω to 2Ω) . Note that the frequency is expressed in reduced coordinates : due to the definition 
of Ω  (10), these antireflection properties can be obtained in any frequency range, varying only the length scales L2 and 
L1 (which are linked by the value of y). In the case L2 = 200 nm, the cut-off frequency Ω is 1.22 1015 rad.s-1: according to 
the curve, related to the value α =0.15, one can find, e.g., that the reflectivity of a film with thickness d = 30 nm in a 
spectral  range  0.5  µm  <  λ  <  1.55  µm  does  not  exceed  5%.  The  same  curve  shows  that  a  film  with  the  same 
characteristics,  but  with  L2  =  2  µm  and  10  times  thicker,  will  exhibit  the  same  antireflection  properties  in  the  far  IR 
range (5 µm < λ < 15.5 µm). 
 
Figure 2 illustrates the case of films with p²<0, which do not have a cut-off frequency. Here s2 is positive, and y=0.75. In 
this case, the dielectric constant is continuously increasing throughout the film. Here the “characteristic frequency” used 
to define the reduced frequency x2 writes

thus differing somewhat from definition 10 in order to be made real, but it does not have as above the physical meaning 
of a cut-off frequency. We see here that such films present a quite different behavior, clearly visible in the case of the 
film  with  α=1  :  this  film  presents  a  maximum  of  reflectivity  for  a  reduced  frequency  of  1.5,  and  a  minimum  of 
reflection for a reduced frequency of 3, i.e. they present a rather strong dichroic character.

Now such films are seldom used as self-standing (at least in the optical domain, but it could be so in the RF one) and are 
usually applied as coatings. Figure 3 considers such a case, where an antireflection coating analogous to that of fig. 1, 
but with y=0.25 has been applied on a dielectric substrate with a complex dielectric constant ε2=(n2+χ2)², with n2=3.5 
and χ2=0.75. Such a lossy dielectric presents in itself a rather strong reflection coefficient (typically 0.32). The thin film 
acts as an antireflexion coating in a broad frequency region which can be chosen by adjusting the two length scales of 
the profile U(z) and its thickness, i.e. the parameter α.

In  all  the  above  examples,  the  gradient  of  dielectric  susceptibility  strongly  influences  the  frequency  dispersion  of  the 
film’s reflectivity. Some key properties of this effect should be pointed out, namely : 
- A controlled formation of the areas of both positive and negative inhomogeneity-induced dispersion of a dielectric film 
which  can  be  provided  in  an  arbitrary  spectral  range  via  an  appropriate  choice  of  the  dielectric  susceptibility  profile 
U(z). 
-  Unlike  the  natural  dispersion  of  materials,  where  a  strong  dispersion  nearby  a  resonance  is  accompanied  by  an 
enhanced  absorption,  the  artificial  inhomogeneity-induced  dispersion  can  be  formed  in  a  spectral  range  which  is  far 
from the absorption bands of the material. 
-  The  thickness  of  an  inhomogeneous  antireflection  film  may  be  several  times  smaller  than  that  of  a  standard 
homogeneous quarter-wave plate for a given wavelength, and even more than that of more complex multilayer coatings 
commonly used. For instance, considering a wavelength of 10.2 µm passing through the film relating to figure 3, we 
obtain a thickness of 0.57 µm, instead of 1.5 µm for a standard plate with the same value of n0 =1.6. This difference may 
be useful for optimizing the sizes of antireflection systems. 
 

4.  PROPAGATION  OR  TUNNELING  OF  WAVES  THROUGH  CONVEX  OR  CONCAVE 
BARRIERS 
 
We now want to analyze in more detail the question of the propagation (or in some case tunneling) of waves through 
films with profiles of their dielectric constants defined in (3). Hereafter we will consider the case of symmetric profiles, 
with opposite signs for s1 and s2. In such a case, quantities L1, L2 and d are linked by the relation L1 = d/4y2 , L2 = d/2y. 
Two such classes of films can be defined presenting either a maximum (s1 = -1, s2 = +1, convex profile) or a minimum 
(s1 =+1, s2 = -1, concave profile) with a value Um
 
mU
 
The characteristic frequencies (10) are different for concave ( Ω1) and convex ( Ω2) profiles :

Only  the  concave  profiles  possess  a  cut-off  frequency  below  which  the  wave  can  only  tunnel  through  the  film,  a 
situation that will be studied later. 

4.1. - Group velocities of traveling EM waves in concave and  convex photonic barriers.  
 
The spatial waveforms of the EM field inside the heterogeneous medium are non – sinusoidal and this field is formed 
due to interference of forward and backward waves. Hence the group velocities vg of these waveforms have to be found 
by means of energy flux (Poynting vector) P and energy density W(7) :

Figure  4  :  group  velocities  dependencies  for  three  potentials  of 
different  types  :  (a)  convex  potential,  (b)  concave  potential  with 
cut-off  frequency  smaller  than  light  frequency,  (c)  concave 
potential  with  cut-off  frequency  larger  than  light  frequency 
(tunneling  case).  Group  velocities  are  normalized  to  the  group 
velocity in a constant medium with refractive index equal to n0 
 

 

 

The  group  velocity  dependencies  corresponding  to  three  types  of  profiles  are  represented  on  figure  4.  They  are 
calculated for a wavelength of 800 nm, corresponding to a frequency of  2.36 1015 rad/s. Fig. 4a corresponds to a convex 
profile, and figs 4 b and c to concave profiles with parameter such that fig 4b corresponds to the case of a propagative 
transmission, while fig 4c corresponds to the case of a tunneling transmission.  
Several remarks can be made concerning the group velocity dependencies displayed on fig 4 : 
- despite the fact that the dielectric constant profiles are symmetric, the group velocities are not. This shows that these 
dependencies  are  more  complex  that  the  simple  one  expected  from  the  variations  of  the  local  index  of  refraction. 
analyzing the constituents of the group velocity dependency, one finds that the flux of the Poynting vector is constant 
while the e.m. power density is not.  

-  despite  the  fact  that  the  transmission  modes  are  different  between  fig  4b  (propagating  mode)  and  fig  4c  (tunneling 
modes) the two corresponding dependencies look very similar, while there is a strong difference between the two cases 
(4a and 4b) corresponding to the propagating mode. Hence it follows that, notwithstanding the propagation mode, it is 
essentially the characteristics of the dielectric constant profile which dominate the behaviour of the group velocity. 
- with the knowledge of the group velocities throughout the three films, it is straightforward to calculate, using eq. (25), 
and integrating over z between z=0 and z=d, the group delay induced by the three films. One finds that in all cases this 
group  delay  remains  subluminal  (meaning  that  it  is  smaller  than  d/c).  Hence,  based  on  this  calculation  of  the  group 
velocity, we find no evidence of superluminal propagation in the case of the tunneling regime. Particularly in the case of 
tunneling, no phase velocity can be attributed to the evanescent wave in the film (in the case of propagating wave, one 
could possibly define such a phase velocity in the η-space, where the waves are sinusoidal, but we did not explore this 
possibility).  However,  it  is  possible  to  define  a  phase  delay  time  by  calculating  the  phase  shift ϕ-  introduced  by  the 
tunneling  through  the  film  in  the  transmission  function.  This  “phase-time”  has  been  abundantly  discussed  in  the 
literature, and served as a base for the claim of “superluminal propagation”, and is defined as  
 

pt

=

ϕ
−∂
ω
∂

 

 

 

 

 
Applying this definition, one finds(11) that the phase time corresponding to fig 4c is 0.4 fs, corresponding to an average 
velocity of 0.65 c. No superluminal propagation can be suspected on this ground either. Moreover, it is shown in (11) that 
there is a link between the phase shifts in transmission and in reflection. The following relation can be established :

This  relation  offers  a  possibility  of  investigating  the  phase  time  dependence  without  being  handicapped  by  the  very 
strong  attenuation  of  the wave  in  the  case  of  tunneling,  and  such  a  study  was  performed  in  (20)  in  the  radiofrequency 
case. This is particularly interesting for studying the Hartman effect, namely the saturation of phase shift ϕ- when the 
thickness  of  the  sample  increases.  In  our  case,  the  only  way  of  increasing  significantly  the  film  thickness  without 
changing its fundamental property (a cut-off frequency larger than the light frequency) is to stack a number of identical 
plates. For such a system, a recursive relation can be established for the parameter Q (eq. 24) which writes

as well as the corresponding phase time. Their dependence on the number of films (with the same parameters as on fig 
4c) is represented on figure 5.  
 
One sees that both the phase shift and the phase time increases for the first few films (typically m<6), but that there is 
practically no further evolution, and thus a saturation as observed in the Hartman effect. The saturated phase time can be 
expressed as :

which  can  be  negative  if  n0  is  high  enough.  One  can  find  solutions  in ω  such  that  both  conditions  (35)  and  (36)  are 
realized and one is in the tunneling regime. One has to have y²(n0²-1)>1, a condition easy to satisfy. This leads us to the 
conclusion that the phase time, though having the dimension of a time, possesses properties that preclude its acceptation 
as  a  physical  time,  and  therefore  its  use  as  a  ground  for  the  evidence  of  superluminal  propagation.  Finally,  it  can  be 
shown(11) that the saturation of phase time observed on fig. 5 is specific of a lossless medium. Introduction of even a 
very small absorption in the film (by using a complex index of refraction) leads to a constantly growing phase in the 
case of figure 5. Moreover, it is possible to generalize as above the calculation of the group velocity to the case of  a 
stack of m layers : one finds that for allvalues of m,the group velocity stays subluminal. 
 
Finally, we have studied here the intrinsic properties of inhomogeneous films, while as in the case of  section 3, such 
films will be used in the optical domain as coatings. In the case of a semi-infinite substrate with refractive index n1, the 
modifications to the above equation will result from the change in eq (24), Q becoming :

This will  affect  the  amplitude  of  the wave reflected  at  the  interface  z= d,  and  thus  the  structure of  both  the  Poynting 
vector and the energy density (the incoming wave in not modified) and, consequently, the group velocity (through the 
functions θ ). The above calculations can easily be reproduced in such a case, and their results do not change the general 
conclusions given above. 

5.  GROUP VELOCITY DISPERSION IN INHOMOGENEOUS OPTICAL BARRIERS 
 
A last interesting property that can be obtained from the group velocity is the group velocity dispersion introduced by 
such films. Indeed, we have seen that the HID is much stronger than typical intrinsic material dispersion, and that it is 
also  frequency  dependent  (in  a  plasma  or  waveguide  way).  One  can  thus  expect  that  such  films  will  exhibit  a  strong 
group velocity dispersion. Here again, one has to investigate this point without resorting to the usual definition with the 
help of the phase velocity, which is not defined in such films. To do so one can use the group delay time calculated from 
the group velocity inside the film, as mentioned above. Such a group delay time can be obtained in all cases, but the 
case of transmitting barriers is the most relevant in terms of possible applications. In such a case, one has to use the “+” 
definition of the group velocity (eq 25). Noting

Figure 6 presents the particularly interesting case of  a concave profile of U used just above its cut-off frequency. In 
expression  (41),  many  quantities  are  extremely  frequency  dependent  close  to  the  cut-off  frequency  and  so  does  the 
group delay time, as shown on figure 6. In the usual language of group velocity dispersion, this case corresponds to a 
negative  dispersion  (the  blue  frequencies  go  faster  than  the  red  ones).  It  should  be  pointed  out  that  important  group 
delays (as high as 30 fs) are obtained in this case with a film of thickness equal to 100 nm only, which illustrates the 
very unique properties of HID.

Figure  6  :  group  delay  time  as  a  function  of 
frequency  for  a  concave  index  profile  (identical  to 
that  of  figure  4b)  used  just  above  its  cut-off 
frequency 

Figure  7  :  group  delay  time  as  a  function  of  frequency, 
plotted  over  a  large  frequency  interval  encompassing  the 
film’s  characteristic  frequency  in  the  case  of  the  convex 
profile of fig 4a 

 
It is enlightening to compare this case to that of a convex profile of U such as the one investigated above (fig 4a). The 
result of an equivalent calculation over a broad range of frequency encompassing the characteristic frequency shows that 
contrary to the above case, the group delay stays very small (~ 1fs) with a moderate dispersion, showing no resonant 
character. This obviously results from the fact that the crossing of the characteristic frequency does not give rise to any 
resonant phenomena (like, in the concave case, a value of zero for N+ which appears several times in the denominator).  
 

6.  CONCLUSIONS 
 
In  this  work,  we  presented  a  number  of  properties  which  can  be  studied  with  the  help  of  exacts  solutions  of 
electromagnetic  propagation  equations,  applied  to  media  presenting  fast  and  deep  spatial  variations  of  their  dielectric 
constant. Even though this method applies easily to specific analytical forms of such profiles, they contain enough free 
parameters  to  describe  films  with  very  different  structures.  Being  exact,  such  solutions  are  subject  to  no  limitations 
concerning the amplitude or the length scales over which the dielectric function varies. Several previously investigated 
cases  can  be  considered  as  limiting  cases  for  our  calculation.  Being  scalable,  this  method  applies  to  any  wavelength 
range, from the RF to the XUV, provided that the materials allowing to realize the dielectric constant profiling exist.  
 
Our  method  allows  to  understand  in  detail  how  the  shape  of  the  dielectric  constant  variation  influences  the  various 
properties of such films. It reveals the essential concept of Heterogeneity Induced Dispersion (HID), which was shown 
to be dependent only upon the two spatial scales defining the studied profiles. In the absence of any standard material 
dispersion, it can lead to effects exceeding by orders of magnitude those generally observed on dispersive materials, and 
this in the absence of any absorption (which is usually associated with strong dispersive properties, which are generally 
obtained  only  close  to  material’s  resonances).  Depending  on  the  type  of  profile  used  (concave  or  convex),  HID  can 
present or not a cut-off frequency below which propagation through the medium is impossible, and evanescent waves 
are formed. 
 
We  studied  the  reflection  properties  of  such  films  and  observed  that  they  can  possess  dichroic  or  antireflection 
properties,  and  this  over  a  wide  wavelength  range.  This  offers  for  instance  the  opportunity  of  realizing  antireflection 
coatings in domains where standard methods are difficult to apply. 
 
This method also allows to study in detail the propagation or the tunneling of waves through such index-gradient films. 
In the case of tunneling, we could obtain the associated group delay time and found no sign of superluminal propagation 
as far as group velocity is concerned. The “phase time” corresponding to such films can also be calculated, and again 

showed no sign of superluminality, but instead some features – such as the fact that it can take negative values – which 
forbid  to  consider  it  as  an  acceptable  physical  time,  despite  its  dimension.  However,  stacking  a  variable  number  of 
identical films, we were able to reproduce the basic feature giving rise to the Hartman effect, i.e. the saturation of the 
phase shift when the thickness of the tunneling barrier increases. Finally we showed that when used close to their cut-off 
frequency, in the propagative mode, such films can have some exceptional negative group velocity dispersion. Trying to 
otpimize their properties with the aim of manipulating the shape of broadband ultrashort pulses is certainly one of the 
perspectives opened by this study. 
 
Concerning  the  possible  applications  of  the  results  presented  above,  index-gradient  films  are  currently  in  use  in  the 
optical  domain.  However,  our  analytical  method  allows  simple  and  fast  calculations  which  could  prove  useful  in  the 
monitoring  of  the  growth  of  such  films.  One  could  for  instance  study  algorithms  aiming  at  correcting  on  line  the 
parameters  of  a  reactor  to  compensate  the  deviations  measured  during  the  growth.  Also  the  possibility  of  designing 
system with specific dispersion or reflection properties in any wavelength range appears as an exciting possibility.

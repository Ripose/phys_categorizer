The similarity theory is derived for ultra-relativistic laser-plasma interactions. First, it is shown
that the most fundamental S−similarity is valid for both under- and overdense plasmas. Then,
the particular case of tenious plasma is considered in great detail. It is shown that the electron
dynamics in this case has two characteristic scales. The fast scale corresponds to relaxation to some
attractor solution. The slow dynamics describes an adiabatic evolution of this attractor. This leads
to a remarkable wave breaking exclusion rule in the 3D geometry. A similarity theory for the slow
dynamics allows obtaining simple “engineering” scalings for the maximum electron energies, the
number of accelerated electrons, the electron beam density, and for the acceleration distance. These
scalings are aimed at design of a high-energy laser-plasma accelerator generating electron beams
with superior properties.

INTRODUCTION

practical use.

The concept of laser-plasma electron acceleration has
the decisive advantage over conventional accelerators:
plasma supports electric ﬁelds orders of magnitude higher
than the breakdown-limited ﬁeld in radio-frequency cav-
ities of conventional linacs. It is expected that the rela-
tivistic laser-plasma will ﬁnally lead to a compact high
energy accelerator [1]. The very ﬁrst experiments already
have delivered high quality electron beams in the energy
range 70...170 MeV [2–4]. Yet the way to a real laser-
plasma accelerator that generates a high-energy electron
beam with superior properties is long and full of prob-
lems which have to be solved. The main obstacle is that
the experiments depend on too many parameters. Of-
ten, this makes the interpretation of experimental results
ambiguous. At the same time, theoretical models suﬀer
from the similar drawback. The system of kinetic equa-
tions describing the problem is both strongly non-linear
and contains many parameters. As a result, the quest
of searching for new perspective acceleration regimes is
challenging and the physics of electron acceleration in
plasma is often rather obscure.

The scientiﬁc diﬃculties just listed are neither new nor
unique. A century ago hydrodynamics encountered and
successfully overcame analogous diﬃculties. This has led
not only to understanding of non-trivial theoretical prob-
lems, but also to a prominent practical achievement that
is the design of the airplane. One can wonder how it was
possible to design a reliable aircraft having neither com-
plicated numerical simulations, nor comprehensive infor-
mation about analytical solutions of the hydrodynamics
equations. The answer is well known: it was the similar-
ity theory that enabled physicists and engineers to ﬁnd
a clue to hydrodynamical problems [5, 6]. The similar-
ity allows engineers to scale the behavior of a physical
system from a laboratory acceptable size to the size of

To the best of our knowledge, no similarity theory
has been applied to relativistic laser plasma interactions.
This situation is surprising and unnatural, because the
power of similarity theory for the magnetic conﬁnement
was recognized in the late 70s and the similarity theory
[7] has been in use for design of large devices (tokamaks,
stellarators) ever thereafter [8].

The aim of this article is to ﬁll this theoretical gap. For
the ﬁrst time, we develop a similarity theory for laser-
plasma interactions in the ultra-relativistic limit. Start-
ing with the relativistic Vlasov equation on the electron
distribution function and the Maxwell equations on elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds, we show that the similarity parameter
S = ne/a0nc exists, where a0 = eA0/mec2 is the rela-
tivistically normalized laser amplitude, ne is the plasma
0/4πe2 is the critical den-
electron density and nc = meω2
sity for a laser with the carrier frequency ω0. The basic
ultra-relativistic similarity states that laser-plasma inter-
actions with diﬀerent a0 and ne/nc are similar as soon as
the similarity parameter S = ne/a0nc = const for these

interactions. The S
can serve as a crucial test to check reliability of various
numerical codes and over-simpliﬁed theoretical models of
relativistic laser-plasmas.

similarity is valid for both over- and un-
derdense plasmas. In the present work, we are interested
in the special limit S
1 of relativistically underdense
plasmas as it is important for the high energy electron
acceleration. We develop a detailed similarity theory
for this case and derive scalings for laser-plasma interac-
tions where the parameter S varies. It follows from the
theory that in the optimal conﬁguration the laser pulse

and ω2
p = 4πnee2/me is the plasma frequency. This cor-
responds to the so called “Bubble” acceleration regime
[9]. It appears that the bubble is a natural attractor for

the laser-plasma dynamics.

The theory developed in the present paper reveals two
characteristic time scales. The fast time scale describes
relaxation to the attractor solution. The slow time scale
corresponds to an adiabatic evolution of the attractor.
We were able to develop a similarity theory for the slow
dynamics and to obtain scalings important for practical
realization of a possible future high energy laser-plasma
accelerator.

The central result of our theory is that the bubble
regime of electron acceleration is stable, scalable and the
scaling for the maximum energy Emono of the monoen-
ergetic peak in the electron spectrum is

derive the basic S
plasma. In the following sections, we concentrate on the
particular case of tenious plasmas with S
1. In section
III we elaborate a Hamiltonian approach to the electron
dynamics in new canonical variables and introduce the
axial gauge for potentials. Section IV discusses multi-
ple time scale dynamics. In section V we compare wave
breaking in the 3D and 1D geometries. It appears that
the slow adiabatic dynamics has a lower dimensionality.
This leads to a wave breaking exclusion rule in the 3D
geometry.
In section VI we construct the relevant set
of three dimensionless parameters deﬁned by the initial
laser pulse. In section VII we develop similarity theory

for the slow (adiabatic) dynamics. This similarity the-
ory is of a non-trivial “ladder” type as clariﬁed in sec-
tion VIII. To check our analytical scalings we use 3D
Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations using the code Virtual
Laser-Plasma Laboratory (VLPL) [10]. The numerical
results are discussed in section IX. The concluding sec-
tion X recapitulates the main results and collects some
additional simple scalings.

Consequently, for the ultra-relativistic amplitude a0
1,
the laser-plasma dynamics does not depend separately
on a0 and ne/nc. Rather, they converge into the single
similarity parameter S.

À

The ultra-relativistic similarity means that when the
plasma density and the laser amplitude change simulta-
neously so that S = ne/a0nc = const, the laser-plasma
dynamics remains similar. Particularly, this basic ultra-
relativistic scaling states that for diﬀerent interaction
cases with the same S = const, the plasma electrons
move along similar trajectories and their momenta p
scale as

The ultra-relativistic similarity is valid for arbitrary

values. In fact, the S parameter appears only in the
initial condition (13). It plays the role of the laser fre-
quency and separates the relativistically overdense plas-

case of electron acceleration in underdense plasma, par-
ticularly the bubble regime [9]. A numerical check of the

in laser-generated wake ﬁelds. Because S is now a small
parameter, one can hope to obtain additional scalings
and to get a deeper insight into the physics of electron
acceleration in underdense plasmas.

We have deliberately used the non-canonical variables
(P0, Q1, Q2, x0, x1, x2, T ) in the new form of the Valsov
Eq. (23). The advantage of these variables is that they
help to separate fast and slow electron dynamics in the
laser pulse.

IV. MULTIPLE TIME SCALES AND THE
ATTRACTOR SOLUTION

In this section we show that the fast electron dynamics
is in fact a relaxation to some attractor solution, while
the slow dynamics describes an adiabatic evolution of this
attractor.

this interaction stage and in the following analytics we
use the relativistically simpliﬁed expression (24) for Q0.

electron dynamics into the fast and the slow ones. Be-
cause of the factor 1/P0 in the right hand side of the last
equation in (21), one concludes that this equation is re-
sponsible for the fast dynamics. In its turn, this equation
leads to the last term in the Vlasov Eq. (23).

The critical points of the vector ﬁeld V are deﬁned as

that the solutions of the equations V1 = 0 and V2 = 0 are
hyperbolas whose asymptotes are perpendicular to each
other (see Fig. 1). Moreover, the asymptotes of V2 = 0
can be obtained from those of V1 = 0 by a π/4 turn
around the center of the V1 = 0-hyperbola, Fig. 1. Thus,
the vector ﬁeld V has two critical points. We denote the

VI. PARAMETERS IN DYNAMIC EQUATIONS
AND INITIAL CONDITIONS

In the previous section we have derived Eq. (30) that
includes only the ”slow” (adiabatic) dynamics. The
”fast” dynamics putting the system into the vicinity of
the attracting focus Q(
) has already been taken into
account by Eq. (25). Now we are going to develop a
similarity theory describing only this ”slow” dynamics
rather than the both ”slow” and ”fast” ones as Eq. (23)
does. For this purpose, we introduce the following tilde-
variables and tilde-functions

A

˜x0 = S1/2x0,

˜xi = xi,

−1/2T,

˜T = S
˜Ai = Ai,
˜Qi = S1/2Qi,

˜ϕ = S1/2 ˆϕ,
˜P0 = P0,

˜ne = S1/2ne,

(41)

where i = 1, 2.

We rewrite the Maxwell equations in the tilde-

where v0 = 1/(2a2

Eqs. (39) yield the one-dimensional Vlasov equation

(∂T + ∂x0 v0 + ∂P0 u0) f = 0.

Now we are able to compare the 1D and 3D dynam-
ics. Notice that for the 3D case we used the fact that the

(38), where this term plays the major role. Moreover, in
the 3D-case we exploited the limit
1 to reduce the
six equations (21) to the three closed equations (32). It
is this dimensionality reduction that has lead to the 3D
wave breaking exclusion rule (35).

Diﬀerential operators in Eqs. (43) do not depend on any

is valid for the retarded solution generated by the right

Now we have to take into account the initial condition

The parameters Π1, Π2, Π3 entirely deﬁne the laser-
plasma dynamics.

The parameter Π1 = S1/2k0R plays the role of the
waist of the laser beam, the parameter Π2 = cτ /R gives
the laser pulse aspect ratio, and Π3 = ω0τ is the laser
pulse duration.

VII. SIMILARITY THEORY FOR THE SLOW
DYNAMICS

One can easily realise that the homogeneous solution
ˆϕh, ˆAh
presented in the tilde-varialbes is the only
source of dimensionless parameters on which the theory
³
(13)). This means
can depend (see, for example, Eq.

´

ˆϕh, ˆAh

that only if a dimensionless parameter enters
,
this parameter is important for the theory. On the con-
³
´
ˆϕh, ˆAh
trary, if the dependence of
from a dimension-
less parameter is negligible, the role of this parameter
³
in the theory is negligible too. It is worth emphasizing
that this fact is not related to the question where or how
long the homogeneous solution exists in plasma. In other
words, the homogeneous solution accumulates the entire
informarion about initial conditions.

´

To develop a similarity theory we note that the param-
eter Π3 gives the charateristic time of the slow envelope
for the homogeneuos solution. If we are mainly interested
in tilde-times

˜T < Π3,

(46)

(ϕ, A) = (ϕh, Ah) + (ϕr, Ar) ,

(44)

where (ϕh, Ah) is a homogeneous solution of the Maxwell
equations, and (ϕr, Ar) is the retarded potential ob-
tained by the convolution of the right hand side of
Maxwell’s equations with the retarded Green function
[13].

Because all the dimensionless parameters have been
shifted into the initial condition (13), they inﬂuence ex-
plicitely only the homogeneous solution Ah. We write it
in the form

Ah =

ah(ω, r) exp(

iω(t

then we can neglect the term with Π3 in the homogeneous

parameters Π1 and Π2. This allows for ﬁnding scalings
describing the ultra-relativistic laser-plasma interaction.
First, we represent the characteristics equations (32)-

(33) of the Vlasov Eq. (30) in the tilde-notation:

˜Qi∂˜x0

where ˜U0 =

∂˜x0 ˜ϕ, and (Π1Π2)/Π3 = S1/2.
We see that Eqs. (47) do not contain the parameter
Π3 explicitely. On the other hand, the P0 dynamics (48)
is completely deﬁned by the solution of Eqs. (47). This
means that the solution for P0 can be represented as

P0 = S1/2d1(Π1, Π2, ˜T , ˜x, ˜x0)

(49)

where d1(Π1, Π2, ˜T , ˜x, ˜x0) is a universal function that
does not depend on Π3.

A. Scalings for the maximum electron energies

Now we are ready to obtain an expression for the rel-
ativistic γ-factor of electrons at the point ˜x0,1,2 at the
”time” ˜T . We use the Hamiltonian (20) and get

γ =

0.5a0P0Q2(

) = a0S

−1/2D1(Π1, Π2, ˜T , ˜x, ˜x0),

−

(50)
where the functions D1,2,3,... (see also below) are univer-
sal.

The expression (50) describes the self-similar electron
energy distribution. We are interested in the largest rel-
ativistic factor of electrons. Fixing the transverse coor-
dinates at the axis y = z = 0, we obtain that after the
accelerating distance x the maximum γ
factor of elec-
trons scales as

Notice that in the case of “pancake”-like laser pulses with
Π2

maximum time (46) untill which our approximations are
valid. Thus, we can describe the laser-plasma dynamics
with Π2 < 1 on the length

of the laser pulse. This is also suggested by simulations
[9] and recent experiments [2–4].

We point out that the Bubble regime correspond-

“blowout” regime [15], where the laser radius must be

are not scalable to the area of large a0, since the trans-
formation energy coeﬃcient, characteristic length, etc.,
have an additional nontrivial dependence on a0 owing to
Π1.

If we restrict our consideration to a regime before the
wave-breaking (
< 1) and to tilde-times satisfying
Eq. (46), then we can evaluate the number of the trapped
electrons as

C. Scalings for the electron density compression

One of important practical questions for the electron
acceleration is the density of the electron bunch. Be-
cause our similarity theory considers only the plasma
area where electons move with ultra-relativistic energies,
electron density here scales diﬀerently from the cold back-
ground. The correct scaling for the electron density com-
pression can be extracted directly from the normalization
procedure (41). Because all the tilde-variables are of the
order of unity, one concludes that the compressed density
ncompr of ultra-relativistic electrons (those compressed
by the laser pulse and those in the accelerated electron
bunch) is of the order of

ncompr ∝

√a0nencr = neS

−1/2.

(64)

When we compare the scaling (64) with the scaling for
the number of trapped electrons (63), it looks as if we had
some contradiction. Indeed, at the ﬁrst sight, the scaling
(63) looks as if the density of the trapped electron bunch
scales simply as the background density ne provided that
the bunch dimensions scale together with the radius R
of the accelerating structure. At the same time, the for-
mula (64) suggests that the electron density compression
is S−1/2 times stronger. To overcome this contradiction,
one has to suppose that the electron bunch is structured.
Although the length of the bunch and the electron radial
excursion scale together with R, the bunch must have
a ﬁner internal structure on the scale of the laser wave-
length λ. We abstain from a detailed discussion of this
ﬁne structure in the present paper. Yet, we mention that
it is this ﬁne structuring that is responsible for the very
sharp (on the order of λ) leading edge of the accelerated
bunch as observed in [9]. A ﬁne strucutre is also seen in
our 3D PIC simulation as presented in Fig. 3.

VIII. GEOMETRY OF THE SIMILARITY

Now we want to take a closer look at the geometrical
aspect of the similarity. We have formulated the simi-
larity for the electron distribution function in the vari-
ables ˜T , ˜x0 and ˜x. Thus, the plasma density distrubu-
tion describing the accelerating structure and the bunch
of trapped electrons, is similar only if it is expressed in
these tilde-variables. This geometrical similarity may be
not valid in the laboratory reference frame variables t, x,
y and z. Particularly, since

one easily sees that for a given t, diﬀerent x correspond to
diﬀerent ˜T . In other words, consideration for a given ˜T
means that we compare dynamics at diﬀerent x at diﬀer-
ent laboratoty times t. Generally, there is no “simultane-
ous” geometrical similarity as observed in the laboratory

The last point we are going to discuss in detail is the
non-trivial structure of the developed similarity theory.
There are two characteristic lengths in the laser prop-
agation direction. One scale is Lsim
It is
deﬁned by the normalization (41). Another scale is given
LsimS−1/2
either by the wave breaking distance Lb ∝
(53) or by the laser depletion length Ld = Π2Lb for
1. Our similarity theory states that if we have
Π2
two laser-plasma interaction cases with S2 < S1, then
the second interaction dynamics is similar to the ﬁrst
one on the distance Lsim
. Yet, the laser
pulse in the second interaction runs for a longer distance
. This new interval in the second in-
L2
teraction cannot be scaled up from the ﬁrst interaction
with a smaller S
parameter. Thus, the interactions con-
tain similar and non-similar parts, and the similarity is
“ladder”-like.

The ladder similarity is schematically demonstrated

L21 = (S1/S2)L1. The interaction between the distances
(S1/S2)3/2L1 is new. In the same man-
L21 and L2
ner, the interaction 3 is similar to the interaction 1 up
to the distance L31 = (S1/S3)L1. Further, the interac-
tion 3 is similar to the interaction 2 up to the distance
L32 = (S2/S3)L2, and so on.

is shorter than the relativistic plasma period √a0ω−1

Electron density distribution obtained in the simulation
(iv) after the laser pulse has propagated the distance
L = 400 λ is shown in Fig. 3. The wake ﬁeld takes the
form of a solitary cavity (the bubble) free from the cold
electrons. The bubble runs with the group velocity of the
laser pulse. It traps electrons from the background and
accelerates them to high energies. We let the laser pulses
propagate the distance Li
b = 1000 λ through plasma in
the all four cases. At this distance, the laser pulses are
depleted, the acceleration ceases and the wave breaks.

Fig. 4(i)-(iv) shows evolution of electron energy spec-
tra for these four cases. One sees that the energy spectra
evolve quite similarly. Several common features can be
identiﬁed. First, a monoenergetic peak appears after the
acceleration distance L
200 λ. Later, after the prop-

agation distance L
600 λ, the single monoenergetic
peak splits into two peaks. One peak continues the ac-
celeration towards higher energies, while another peak
decelerates and ﬁnally disappears. Comparing the axises
scales in Fig. 4, we conclude that the scalings (14) and

The electron spectrum evolution obtained in this simu-
lation is shown in Fig. 5. The spectra display a monoen-
ergetic peak whose energy continuously grows up to some
12 GeV at the end. Between the control points, where the
spectra in Fig. 5 have been taken, the laser pulse propa-
gated the distance L = 800λ. This distance between the
control points is Si/Sv = 4 times larger than that in the
cases (i)-(iv). One sees that the ﬁrst ﬁve electron spectra
in Fig. 5 are similar to those in Fig. 4. However, the last
four spectra in Fig. 5 are new. This corresponds to the
ladder similarity as discussed in section VIII.

the propagation distances L1 = 200λ, L2 = 400λ, L3 =
600λ, L4 = 800λ, L5 = 1000λ. The spectra evolve similarly.
The monoenergetic peak positions scale ∝ a0 and the number
of electrons in a 1% energy range also scales ∝ a0 in agreement
with the analytic scalings (14)-(15).

X. CONCLUSIONS

The number of electrons accelerated to this energy scales
as

In this section we recapitulate the most important
results of the developed similarity theory for ultra-
relativistic laser plasmas and provide some simple “engi-
neering” scalings for electron acceleration in the Bubble
regime.

a0.

(i) Ultra-relativistic laser-plasma interactions with dif-
ferent a0 and ne/nc are similar as soon as the similarity
parameter S = ne/a0nc = const for these interactions.
In this case, electron energies scale as Ee ∝
a0 and the
number of accelerated electrons also scale as Ntr ∝
(ii) The electron dynamics in relativistically under-
dense plasmas, S
1, can be separated into a fast dy-
namics and a slow one. The fast dynamics corresponds to
a relaxation to some attractor solution. Its characteristic
time is ∆tf ∝
p). The slow dynamics describes an
adiabatic evolution of this attractor on the characteristic
p).
time scale ∆ts ∝
(iii) The slow electron dynamics leads to a dimension-
ality reduction and to a remarkable 3D wave breaking
exclusion rule (35). Thus, the wave breaking in the real-
istic 3D geometry is qualitatively diﬀerent from that in
the 1D case.

(iv) Starting with the Maxwell equations on the ﬁelds
and the relativistic Vlasov equation on the electron dis-
tribution function we were able to derive scalings for the
electron acceleration. Here, we list the most important
scalings once again. The similarity theory tells us that
the “equilibrium” radius R of the laser pulse scales as

tion results we can express the maximum electron energy

the case when we ﬁx the similarity parameter to some
constant, e.g., S = 10−3. In this case, the energy scaling
is

Thus, the electron energy scales as a square root of the
laser energy. One increases simultaneously the laser pulse
amplitude and the plasma density, while the acceleration

laser amplitude, e.g., a0 = 10, ﬁxes the pulse aspect ratio

For the acceleration to be eﬃcient and to generate struc-
tured (quasi-monoenergetic) electron energy spectra, the
pulse duration τ must be

where the factor 0.03 is taken from the simulation.

The scaling (65) means that to build an eﬃcient laser-
plasma electron accelerator in the 100 GeV energy range,
one would need a 10 kJ class laser with the pulse duration
of some 100 fs.

In the end, in this work the very ﬁrst analytical results
for ultra-relativistic 3D laser-plasma interaction are ob-
tained. The developed non-trivial similarity theory will
help to make another step towards a practical realization
of a high-energy laser-plasma electron accelerator.

The characteristic acceleration length Lb, i.e., the length
before the wave breaking happens, scales as

Abstract

We investigate Lie symmetries of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations in four-dimen-
sional Euclidean space (SDYM). The ﬁrst prolongation of the symmetry generating
vector ﬁelds is written down, and its action on SDYM computed. Determining equa-
tions are then obtained and solved completely. Lie symmetries of SDYM in Euclidean
space are in exact correspondence with symmetries of the full Yang-Mills equations in
Minkowski space.

1 Introduction

The self-dual Yang-Mills equations in Euclidean space (SDYM) are the following ﬁrst-order
nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations:

δµρδνσ −

ǫµνρσ

(∂ρAaσ − ∂σAaρ + CabcAbρAcσ) = 0.

(cid:19)

Greek indices label independent variables xν and run from 0 to 3. Latin indices are associated
with generators of a compact semisimple Lie algebra, with structure constants Cabc. δµρ and
ǫµνρσ are the Kronecker and Levi-Civita symbols (ǫ0123 = 1), respectively. The Aaσ are
dependent variables, namely, gauge potentials.

We shall be interested in Lie symmetries of Eq. (1). Consider a vector ﬁeld v of the form

where Hκ and Φdκ are functions of xν and Aaσ. The ﬁrst prolongation of v is deﬁned as

v = Hκ∂κ + Φdκ

pr(1)v = Hκ∂κ + Φdκ

− (∂λAnα)(∂βAdκ)

∂Φdκ

To obtain Lie symmetries of SDYM, we have to substitute (4) in (3) and let it act on (1).
We obtain

(∂λΦaκ + CabcAbλΦcκ) Zµλνκ − (∂λAnα)(∂βAaκ)

where

Zµλνκ = δµλδνκ − δµκδνλ − ǫµνλκ.

The vector ﬁeld v generates a symmetry of SDYM provided that Eqs. (5) hold whenever
SDYM hold [1]. In other words, once SDYM are substituted in (5), the coeﬃcients of each
independent combination of derivatives of Aaσ must vanish. Note that SDYM can be written
more explicitly as

∂2An3 − ∂3An2 = ∂0An1 − ∂1An0 + Cnbc(Ab0Ac1 + Ab3Ac2),
∂3An1 − ∂1An3 = ∂0An2 − ∂2An0 + Cnbc(Ab0Ac2 + Ab1Ac3),
∂1An2 − ∂2An1 = ∂0An3 − ∂3An0 + Cnbc(Ab0Ac3 + Ab2Ac1).

2 Determining equations

SDYM only involve combinations of derivatives ∂λAnα that are antisymmetric in λ and α.
Coeﬃcients of symmetric combinations must therefore vanish. Accordingly, we set to zero
the coeﬃcient of (∂λAnα)(∂βAmκ), symmetrized in λ ↔ α, in β ↔ κ and, furthermore, in
(λnα) ↔ (βmκ). The result is, ∀µ, ν, λ, κ, β, α, a, m and n

The hat means that the summation convention is not to be carried over λ. The last equation
holds identically if and only if, ∀β, λ and n

∂Hβ
∂Anλ

= 0.

Thus in Eqs. (5), all terms quadratic in partial derivatives of Adκ vanish.

Let us now switch to terms linear in partial derivatives. The coeﬃcient of ∂λAnα, sym-
metrized in λ ↔ α, must vanish. Writing down the coeﬃcient, and considering in turn all
independent values of indices, one ﬁnds that conditions for this are that ∀a, n and ∀ˆλ, ˆα

For given n, of the six antisymmetric combinations ∂λAnα − ∂αAnλ, only three are inde-
pendent, others being constrained by Eqs. (7)–(9). The choice of independent combinations
is arbitrary. We pick (λ, α) = (0, 1), (0, 2) and (0, 3), and substitute dependent combinations
as given by (7)–(9) in (5). The coeﬃcient of independent combinations must then vanish.
After some calculation we ﬁnd that, ∀a, n and ∀ˆλ, ˆα

There remain terms with no derivatives in Adκ. To terms in (5) we must add the ones
coming from the substitution of SDYM just before Eq. (15). The sum must vanish, yielding

3 Solution of Determining Equations

We proceed to solve Eqs. (12), (13), (14), (15), (16) and (17).

Eqs. (12) imply that Hβ is independent of Anλ, that is, Hβ = Hβ(xν). Combining (13)
with (15), we see that ∂ˆαH ˆα is independent of ˆα. Combining (14) with (16), we ﬁnd that
∀λ, α 6=, ∂αHλ = −∂λHα. This means that

∂κHλ = fλκ + δλκG,

where G and fλκ = −fκλ are arbitrary functions of xν. Coeﬃcients of δan in (13), (15) and
(16) have by now all vanished.

From (14) we see that Φaκ is independent of Anα for a 6= n and κ 6= α. Moreover, Φaκ is

linear in Aaα. With (18), we can thus write

Φaκ = fκα(xν)Aaα + Faκ(Amκ, xν).

From (15), we see that ∀a and n, ∂Φaˆα/∂An ˆα is independent of ˆα. A little thought shows
that Φaκ must be linear in Anκ, so that

Φaκ = fκα(xν)Aaα + han(xν)Anκ + Faκ(xν).

Eqs. (18) and (20) are the most general solutions of Eqs. (12), (13), (14), (15) and (16).

There remains to substitute (18) and (20) in (17), which must hold as an identity. In other
words, the coeﬃcients of each combinations of Adκ must vanish. After some manipulations,
there result the following equations:

∂µFaν − ∂νFaµ − ǫµνλκ∂λFaκ = 0
∂µhˆaˆa − ∂ˆνfµˆν − ǫµˆνλα∂λfαˆν = 0
∂µhan − CancFcµ = 0
Cabnhnc − Cacnhnb − Cnbchan + CabcG = 0

∀µ, ν, a;
∀ˆa, ∀µ, ˆν 6=;
∀µ, ∀a, n 6=;
∀a, b, c.

It was shown in [2] that the most general solution of Eqs. (24) is

where χc is an arbitrary function of xν. Substituting (25) in (23), we see that

han = −Gδan + Cancχc,

Fcµ = ∂µχc.

Thus, (21) holds identically. Substituting (25) in (22) yields ∀µ, ˆν 6=

− ∂µG = ∂ˆνfµˆν + ǫµˆνλα∂λfαˆν.

There only remains to solve Eqs. (27). Note that they do not involve group indices. The

general solution of (27) can be eﬀected as follows.

1. Eliminate G from the 12 Eqs. (27) to obtain 8 equations for p = f10 + f23, q = f20 + f31
and r = f30 + f12. Show that all third derivatives of p, q and r vanish and that (all
constants being arbitrary)

p = e + e0t + e1x + e2y + e3z + e00(t2 + x2 − y2 − z2)

+ 2e12(xy + tz) + 2e13(xz − ty),

q = e′ + e3t − e2x + e1y − e0z + e12(t2 − x2 + y2 − z2)

+ 2e13(tx + yz) + 2e00(xy − tz),

r = e′′ − e2t − e3x + e0y + e1z + e13(t2 − x2 − y2 + z2)

+ 2e12(yz − tx) + 2e00(xz + ty).

2. With the help of Eq. (18), express the 4 remaining equations in terms of the functions

p, q and r and of second derivatives of Hλ.

3. Show that the resulting system has no solution for e00, e12 or e13 diﬀerent from zero, and
that its most general solution is (with bλα antisymmetric and all constants arbitrary)

Hλ = −

cλxαxα + cαxλxα + bλαxα + dxλ + aλ.

Putting everything together, we ﬁnd that

Φaκ = (−cκxα + cαxκ + bκα)Aaα − (d + cαxα)Aaκ + CabdχdAbκ + ∂κχa.

(32)

Eqs. (31) and (32) are the most general solution of the determining equations. Therefore,
the corresponding vector ﬁeld (2) generates Lie symmetries of SDYM. One can see that
the constants aµ correspond to uniform translations; that the bµν correspond to rotations
in Euclidean space; that the cµ correspond to uniform accelerations; that d corresponds
to dilatations; and that the functions χa(xν) correspond to local gauge transformations.
This agrees with results found in the special case where the gauge group is SU(2) [3, 4].
Therefore, Lie symmetries of SDYM in Euclidean space correspond to symmetries of the
Yang-Mills equations in Minkowski space, which are conformal transformations and gauge
transformations [2, 5].

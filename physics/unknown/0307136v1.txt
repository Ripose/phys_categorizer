2

Most  organisms  grow  according  to  simple  laws,  which  in  principle  can  be  derived  from  energy
conservation and scaling arguments, critically dependent on the relation between the metabolic rate
B of energy flow and the organism mass  m. Although this relation is generally recognized to be of
the form  B(m) = mp, the specific value of the exponent  p  is  the  object  of  an  ongoing  debate,  with
many mechanisms being postulated to support different predictions. We propose that  multicellular
tumor  spheroids  provide  an  ideal  experimental  model  system  for  testing  these  allometric  growth
theories, especially under controlled conditions of malnourishment and applied mechanical stress.

1. INTRODUCTION

As  early  as  1948,  A.K.  Solomon  proposed  the  use  of  physical  techniques  for  the  development  of
mathematical  models  of  both  cancer  growth  and  related  therapy  [1].  However,  only  recently  have
the  combined  power  of  detailed  biomedical  observations  and  increased  computational  capabilities
enabled  realistic  numerical  simulations  [2-10].  Since  growth  mechanisms  stem,  ultimately,  from
cellular  interactions,  the  above  mentioned  “microscopic”  models  should,  in  principle,  suffice.  Yet,
in  some  cases,  remarkable  collective  patterns  are  observed,  which  suggest  the  adoption  of  a
“macroscopic”  approach,  not  as  an  alternative,  but  as  a  natural  complement  of  the  microscopic
models.  It  was  recently  proposed  [11]  that  tumors  may  follow  the  general  model  of  ontogenetic
growth  for  all  living  organisms  (from  mammals  to  mollusks  to  plants)  developed  by  West,  Brown
and  Enquist  (WBE)  [12].  Due  to  its  implications  for  tumor  metastasis,  cell  turnover  rates,
angiogenesis,  and  invasion,  the  proposal  of  ref.  11  has  immediately  contributed  to  an  ongoing
debate [13].

          The beauty of the WBE model is that it is  entirely  based  on  energy  conservation  and  other
general  physical  arguments,  i.e.,  scaling.  They  start  with  the  assumption  that  the  energy  intake,
supplied  by  ingested  nutrients,  is  spent  partly  to  support  the  metabolic  functions  of  the  organism’s
existing  cells  and  partly  for  cell  replication,  i.e.  to  reproduce  new  cells.  Based  on  this  key
assumption, a universal growth curve is derived, which the authors conjectured to be applicable to
all  living  organisms.  Their  conjecture  is  supported  by  data  encompassing  many  different  species
[12]. Although they assumed B (cid:181) mp with p=3/4, their value of p is not universally accepted. Indeed
there is strong evidence that growth may be consistent with a 2/3 law in the case of birds and small
mammals [14]. Also, in a recent study, Makarieva, Gorshkov, and Li suggest that it is the process of
energy  consumption  and  not  the  transport  of  nutrients  on  fractal-like  networks  that  determines  the
dependence of plant energetics on size [15].

         Many different explanations have been put forward for the scaling laws, ranging from four-
dimensional  biology  [16]  and  quantum  statistics  [17]  to  long-bone  allometry  combined  with
muscular  development  [18],  but,  as  yet,  the  debate  is  far  from  being  settled.  In  this  Letter  we
suggest that multicellular tumor spheroids (MTS) are excellent experimental model systems to test
the  validity  of  the  proposed  mechanisms.  MTS  are  spherical  aggregations  of  malignant  cells
[19,20], which can be grown in vitro under strictly controlled nutritional and mechanical conditions.
Although  cells  appear  to  preserve  the  evolutionary  self-organization  rules  governing  the  growth  of
the original tumor line, they also evolve according to the environmental conditions of the particular
experimental setting. Here we show that MTS indeed grow following a scaling law and obtain their
expected  properties  under  conditions  of  malnourishment  and  rising  mechanical  stress  –  conditions
that often apply also to tumors in vivo.

3

         Before specializing to the MTS problem, we first generalize WBE’s theory to arbitrary values
of  the  scaling  exponent  p  (with  the  restriction  that  p <=  1).  Following  WBE,  we  assume,  for
simplicity,  that  metabolism  and  growth  are  the  same  for  all  the  cells  of  a  given  individual,
belonging to any given  taxon, and constant throughout its lifespan. Let  B  be  the  resting  metabolic
energy expenditure of an organism. Then, at any time  t and for any discrete short time interval  Dt,
we write the law of energy conservation as:

=D
tNtB

D+D

,N

)1(

where N is the total number of cells in the organism, b is the metabolic rate for a single cell, and e  is
the energy required to create a new cell. Let m be the mass of a single cell and m = Nm  the mass of
the whole organism. Writing  B = B0mp, Eq. (1) becomes,

where a = m B0/e and b = b/e. This general equation covers the whole gamut of observed  allometric
power laws. For instance,  p = 3/4  corresponds  to  the  fractal-like  distribution  network  of  the  WBE
model, while p = 2/3 follow from the assumption that what is relevant is the nutrient entry through
a  two-dimensional  surface  that  encloses  a  three  dimensional  volume.  From  Eq.  2  it  follows  that,
starting from a mass m0 at birth, m increases (with a decreasing rate) up to a maximum body size  M
= (a/b)1/(1-p), corresponding to the zero growth point dm/dt = 0. Introducing the function

which  does  not  depend  on  the  choice  of    p  and  is  therefore  from  the  theoretical  point  of  view
universally valid.

        Next we discuss some implications of these results for the specific situation of  multicellular
tumor spheroids, MTS. Likely, effective nutrient absorption cannot start immediately after spheroid
implantation into the experimental surrounding, rather it should begin with a delay that depends on
the  chosen  malignant  cell  line  and  on  the  matrix  properties.  We  model  this  start-up  phase  or
“accommodation time” by replacing the parameter a in  Eq. (2) by the time-dependent function,

where T is the effective accommodation time.

A. The impact of nutrients replenishment on MTS growth

Data from  Freyer  and  Sutherland  [21]  show  that  when  the  nutrient  content  of  the  tissue  culture
medium  is  depleted  (in  particular  of  glucose  and  oxygen),  the  growth  curve  of  the  spheroids  is
modified, i.e. it reaches a mass  lower than  the  asymptotic  value  M .  The  condition  of  insufficient
nutrient  availability  can  be  reproduced  in  our  model  by  the  subtraction  of  a  term  in  Eq.  (2),
,  i.e.  to  assume  that  it
representing the missing power. It is plausible to write such a term as
can  be  scaled  as  the  supply  term pm ,  with  the  fraction

         Figure (1) shows experimental data from Ref. 21 for different degrees of undernourishment.
Since  the  available  data  do  not  allow  us  to  select  an  optimal  value  for  p,  we  choose  p=2/3  as  our
working  assumption  for  the  fits  (the  same  applies  to  Fig.  2).  The  solid  lines  are  model  fits.  The
agreement is excellent, except for the case of most severe undernourishment (f  =  0.8).  This  is  not
surprising,  because  a  strong  nutrient  deficiency  should  also  result  in  a  substantial  reduction  of  the
metabolic rate.

B. Impact of mechanical stress on MTS growth

Furthermore,  it  has  been  suggested  that  tumor  growth  and  metastasis  may  be  influenced  by
mechanical stress. In particular,  Helmlinger et al. have investigated the volumetric growth of MTS
cultured  in  agarose  gels,  showing  that  growth  is  inhibited  when  the  gel  concentration  is  increased
[22].  This  result  can  be  explained  with  increasing  local  stress,  which  in  turn  leads  to  a  higher  cell
density r. In fact, while r is normally assumed to be constant throughout the entire growth process,
the  data  from  Ref.  22  show  that  the  cell  density  may  increase  as  a  result  of  increasing  mechanical
stress  within  the  microenvironment.  Correspondingly,  Freyer  and  Schor  report  that  cells  in  the
internal MTS layers experience a size reduction by up to a factor of three [23]. In order to model the
impact of increasing mechanical stress, we assume that MTS exhibit some ability to be  compacted,
if  not  compressed,  under  mechanical  stress,  so  that  the  cell  density  r  varies  over  time.  As  a
consequence, the variable of interest is no longer the mass  m, but the volume  v = m/r(t),  which  is

and density r in conditions of full nutrient availability and define, in analogy with Eq. (3),

where  g(t)  =  [r(t)/R] 1-p.  The parameter  f  represents,  as  in  Eq.  (7),  the  coefficient  of  “missing
power”.  It  can  also  be  used  to  model  the  conditions  of  reduced  mass  growth  that  may  result  as  an
additional  effect  of  large  mechanical  stress.  Equation  (10)  allows  us  to  plot  the  volume  growth
curves, once the dependence of  r on  t  is  specified.  To  find  its  time  dependence  we  note  that:  (i)
both,  nutrient  availability  and  tumor  growth  are  tightly  correlated,  (ii)  increases  in  confining
mechanical stress are a direct result of volumetric tumor growth, and (iii)  such  raising  mechanical
stress  has  a  similar  reducing  effect  on  tumor  growth  as  malnourishment,  and  that  r(t)  grows
exponentially with the same time constant as a1(t). We then propose the following ansatz,

where  r0  is  the  initial  value  of  the  density,  corresponding  to  the  initial  mass  mo.  We  expect  the
asymptotic value for the density,  R, to be a monotonically increasing function of the stress, with  R
= r0  for the unstressed spheroid. The asymptotic volume is given by,

        Growth data for various gel concentrations from Ref. 22 are shown together with model fits in
Fig.  2.  Note  the  substantial  increase  in  the  accommodation  time  as  the  gel  concentration  (and  thus
the  mechanical  stress)  is  increased.  These  results  suggest  that  it  takes  a  relatively  long  time  for  the
tumor cells to develop a suitable nutrient uptake within a stressed matrix. Finally, the fitting results
show that the effective under-nourishment  f  is  also  increased  with  the  gel  concentration,  while  the
terminal tumor volume is sharply reduced.

2. CONCLUSIONS

In here, we suggest that multicellular tumor spheroids can be used as an experimental model system
to test  allometric  growth  laws  under  controlled  environmental  conditions.  Specifically,  we  have
presented a theoretical model that describes their evolution under conditions of insufficient nutrient
supply  and/or  of  rising  mechanical  stress,  and  whose  solutions  agree  with  experimental  data.  The
exponent in  Eq.  (8)  indicates  that  growth  is  less  affected  by  malnourishment  when  p  is  closer  to
unity. Although we derived  Eq.  (7)  for  multicellular  spheroids,  one  could  speculate  that  the  final
size of tumors or more general, organisms that grow according to the  3/4  law  will  be  less  severely

modified by nutrient scarcity than the final size of those following the  2/3  law.  In  two-dimensional
in vitro diffusion-controlled growth,  p = 2/3 should be replaced by  p  =  1/2,  while  in  theory  for  a
one-dimensional line of cells, i.e. growing in a tube and fed through its ends, we should take  p = 0.
This  indicates  that  sensitivity  to  nutrient  deprivation  is  increased  in  lower-dimensionality  systems,
such  as  in  tumor  cell  aggregates  growing  on  flat  substrates  in  cell  culture  or,  more  importantly,
invasive  tumor  cells  forming  chain-like  patterns  along  preferred  anatomically  pathways,  which  in
turn should impact their  chemotactic  behavior.  Finally,  our  results  for  growth  under  stress  indicate
that  normal  nutrient  uptake  patterns  are  severely  impaired  by  increasing  mechanical  stress.  This
should have implications for cancer growth in the neighborhood of robust tissues, such as bone.

         Our conclusions should stimulate experimentalists to conduct careful ‘long-term’ studies of
MTS  growth  and  expansion  within  distinctively  different  microenvironmental  settings.  Such
microtumor  growth  studies  should  then  shed  light  not  only  on  various  important  aspects  of  the
dynamics of cancer growth, but also on the current allometric growth law controversy.

Abstract 

The transition wake fields excited by relativistic point charge in cylindrical resistive round pipe 
are studied. The problem has been solved for the infinite pipe with abrupt change of the walls 
conductivity  from  perfect  boundary  condition  to  resistive.  The  analytical  presentation  of  the 
longitudinal monopole wake field is given. 

INTRODUCTION 
The development of the physics of ultra-short, ultra-low emittance relativistic electron beams 
drives to the necessity of exact derivation of the wake fields induced by point charge during the 
interaction with its environment. Although large number of such electro-dynamical problems in 
steady  state  regime  have  been  well  understood  and  derived  in  the  terms  of  the  structure 
impedance  and  wake  potentials  [1,2],  the  transition effects in  some cases are still missed from 
the general picture. The importance of the knowledge on the transition behavior of the excited 
fields  is  driven  also  by  both  better  understanding  of  physical  processes  and  the  proper 
application of the numerical codes to evaluate the excited fields in real structure.      

   The radiation excited by the relativistic charged particle in the infinite round pipe with finite 
conductivity wall material is presented in number of Refs. [1-6]. The impedance of finite length 
resistive tube has been derived in Refs. [7,8].  

In this paper, the study of the longitudinal transition wake fields in resistive tube is given. The 
explicit presentation for the transient wake fields is given when the charge travels along the axis 
of  cylindrically  symmetric  resistive  pipe.    It  is  shown  that  the  characteristic  distance 
  [1,5] 
used in resistive wake field derivation defines the typical transition length of steady state wake 
field formation.

current, a term which becomes important only when 

In  our  calculations  we  will  drop  a  very  high  frequency  term  arising  from  the  displacement 
pω  the plasma frequency of 
the  free  electrons  in  the  metal.  Although  this  term  is  the  source  of  the  secondary  fields,  the 
energy  loss  is  negligibly  small  [9]  and  is  usually  neglected  in  the  classical  treatment  of  the 
problem [6].

charge is penetrating to the metallic walls leading to the Ohmic losses in the walls. The energy is 
taken  from  the  energy  of  the  charge  and  the  charge  excites  the  wake  fields.    The  transition 
behavior  extends  unless  the  retarding  surface  current  reaches  its  steady  state  regime,  in  the 
meantime the steady state wake fields associated with the charge are formed.  

The boundary conditions on the inner surface of the perfectly conducting walls  (

)b
 
are given by the vanishing of the tangential electrical component of the field. In the pipe region 
with finite conductivity  (
 we assume the Leontovich boundary conditions [10] that

are valid for metallic surface.  
   Let  us  start  with  relativistic  charge

DISSCUSSIONS 

Excited wake fields in the resistive pipe are the superposition of the steady state wake-
fields  and  the  transition  fields.  While  the  steady  state  electromagnetic  fields  depend  on  the 
distance  behind  the  driving  charge 
,  the  transition  fields  depend  on  both  the  driving 
z
 (before the charge reaches 
charge position 
. The excited fields are zero for 
z
the  transition)  and  for  s
  (in  front  of  the  charge).  Fig.  2  presents  the  dependence  of

SUMMARY 

 
   We  examined  the  transition  behavior  of  the  wake  fields  excited  by  ultrarelativistic  charge  in 
resistive pipe. The analytical presentation of the excited longitudinal electric field is given, that 
- the 
shows the smooth transition to the steady state regime at charge travel distance of few 
characteristic distance in resistive wakefield derivation. The impedance per unit length is derived 
in transition regime.  
  The results of the work can be useful for evaluation of the transition wakefields and impedances 
in  the  vacuum  chamber  with  non-uniform  metallic  boundary  conditions  along  the  charge 
trajectory.

Abstract

We have analyzed and compared the performance of two novel fast-neutron imaging methods with time-of-flight spectroscopy

capability (see V. Dangendorf et al., these Proceedings).  Using MCNP and GEANT code simulations of neutron and charged-

particle  transport  in  the  detectors,  key  parameters  such  as  detection  efficiency,  the  amount  of  energy  deposited  in  the

converter and the spatial resolution of both detector variants have been evaluated.

Keywords: Fast neutron imaging, Radiography, Time-of-flight, PSF, MTF

1. Introduction

Over  the  last  two  years  we  have  developed  and
tested  two  variants  of  time-resolved,  fast-neutron
imaging  detectors,  that  combine  sub-mm  resolution
spatial  imaging  with  energy  spectroscopy  [1,2].  A
detailed  description  of  the  two  systems  has  been
presented by Dangendorf et al [2,3]. Briefly, the first
of  these,  a  Fast  Neutron  Gas-filled  (FANGAS)

detector [3], consists of a hydrogenous neutron/proton
converter  (polypropylene)  coupled  to  a  triple-step
Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM). Position information
is  obtained  by  the  signal  induced  through  a  resistive
anode on a pad-structured pickup electrode.

The  second,  an  Optical  Fast-Neutron  Imaging
detector  (OTIFANTI)  [2],  consists  of  a  fast  plastic
scintillating  screen,  viewed  by  a  CCD  camera
through suitable optics and a gated image-intensifier.

2

In the present work we report on a study, based on
MCNP  [4]  and  GEANT  [5]  computer-simulation
codes,  that  evaluated  several  key  intrinsic  properties
of the neutron converters in the two variants, namely:
detection efficiency, amount of energy converted into
a measurable signal and position resolution.

2. FANGAS detector

The neutron converter in this detector is a sheet of
polypropylene  of  density  0.92  g/cm3.  Fast  neutrons
interact  with  the  converter  primarily  by  producing
knock-on  protons.  Some  of  the  protons  escape  from
the  converter  and  are  detected  by  the  adjacent
charged-particle  gas  detector.  The  converter  sheet
thickness  is  determined  by  a  compromise  between
efficient  neutron  absorption  and  high  escape
probability of protons from the converter into the gas.

2.1. Detection efficiency and proton energy spectrum

The  calculation  of  detection  efficiency  vs.  sheet
thickness  was  performed  using  the  GEANT  code.  In
it, we calculated the number of protons escaping the
converter  into  the  gas  per  incident  fast-neutron  and
assumed  that  each  escaping  proton  is  detected.  In
addition, the proton energy spectrum was determined.
Fig.  1  shows  the  calculated  detection  efficiency
vs.  converter  thickness  for  three  incident  neutron
energies:  2 MeV, 7.5 MeV and 14 MeV.

Polypropylene Thickness (mm)

Fig. 1. FANGAS detection efficiency vs. converter thickness.

As evident from Fig. 1, detection efficiency initially
increases  with  converter  thickness,  but  then  tends  to
saturate  when  the  thickness  approaches  the  proton
range  in  the  material.  The  efficiency  is  rather  low:
~0.2%  for  a  1-mm-thick  converter  at  a  neutron
energy  of  7.5  MeV.  To  overcome  this  problem  it  is
envisaged  to  stack  ~25  detector  elements,  thus
attaining reasonable detection efficiencies of ~ 5%.

Fig. 2 shows the energy spectra of protons emitted
from the converter at the same three neutron energies,
calculated  for  an  angular  range  of  0-27o    relative  to
the  incident  neutron  direction.  This  angular  range
corresponds to an angle subtended by a 0.5x0.5 mm2
detection pixel located at a distance of 0.5 mm below
the converter [3].

Proton energy (MeV)

Fig. 2. Energy spectra of protons reaching a 0.5x0.5 mm2 detection
pixel situated at a distance of 0.5 mm from the converter

The emitted proton energy distributions are rather
broad and  centred  on  average  energies  of  1.14,  4.97
and  11.7  MeV  for  2,  7.5  and  14  MeV  neutrons,
respectively.  Spectra  of  protons  emitted  at  larger
angles  (pixels  at  a  larger  lateral  distance  from  the
point of interaction) will be softer.

2.2. Influence of neutron scattering on contrast

attaining 

As  mentioned 

detection
above, 
efficiencies  of  ~5  percent  will  require  stacking  ~25
individual  detectors.  Thus,  it  was  necessary  to  study
the  extent  of  image  contrast  deterioration  caused  by
neutrons  scattered  into  a  detector  by  its  neighbours.

3

peaks are broad structures due, respectively, to elastic
and  inelastic  scattering  of  neutrons  by  C  present  in
neighbouring sheets. As can be seen, the contributions
of the latter reactions increase with sheet number.

Normalized profile at Sheet-1

For 
this  purpose,  we  have  performed  MCNP
calculations of an image of 4 carbon blocks located at
a distance of 300 cm from a stack of 25 polypropylene
sheets, 1 mm thick, spaced at 9 mm  from  each  other.
Polypropylene  sheet  dimensions  were  200x200x1
mm3 and they were divided into 1x1 mm2 pixels. The
neutron  source  was  a  point  source  positioned  at  6
meters from the detector. The incident neutron energy
was  7.75  MeV.  On  the  basis  of  published  cross-
sections, the expected contrast of the carbon blocks at
this  energy  is  20%.  For  each  detector  sheet,  the
number  of  neutrons  arriving  at  each  pixel  and  their
energy spectrum were calculated.

Fig. 4 shows profiles taken across the simulated C-

seen, the contrast at the 25th sheet decreases from the
expected 20% to 16.5%, due to neutron scattering.

Fig. 5. Neutron energy spectra at the 1st  and 25th sheet
Fig 6 shows the simulated variation of the number
of  scattered  neutrons  with.  sheet  number,  as  well  as
the ratio of transmitted to scattered neutrons. As can
be  observed,  the  number  of  scattered  neutrons
initially increases until it reaches a maximum around
sheet  number  13.  From  this  point  on,  it  decreases
slowly, due the self absorption of the incident flux.

emitted from the converter is determined at a distance
of 0.5 mm below the converter, which corresponds to
the halfway distance between it and the first GEM [3].
Fig.  7  shows  the  PSF  obtained  in  this  calculation
for  incident  neutron  energies  of  2,  7.5  and  14  MeV.
As  can  be  observed,  the  PSF  becomes  progressively
broader with increasing neutron energy.  This reflects
the  phenomenon  that,  as  the  initial  neutron  energy
increases,  so  does  the  angular  spread  of  knock-on
protons emerging from a converter sheet into the gas.

3. OTIFANTI detector

2.3. Position resolution

The  position  resolution  of  the  FANGAS  detector
has  been  determined  in  a  GEANT  simulation.  First,
we  calculated  the  point  spread  function  (PSF)  for  a
single  sheet  of  1  mm  thick  polypropylene  converter.
An  infinitesimally-narrow  incident  neutron  beam
normal to the polypropylene converter irradiates it at a
single  point.  The  position  distribution  of  protons

In  the  present  work,  the  OTIFANTI  detector
consists  of  a  fast-plastic  (polystyrene)  scintillator
fiber  screen,  200x200x20  mm3  in  dimensions.  The
reason  for  using  scintillating  optical  fibers,  rather
than a plain plastic scintillator slab, is to maintain the
position  resolution,  independent  of  screen  thickness.
The  minimal  fiber  dimensions  in  these  calculations
were 50x50  ìm2. A neutron interacts in the fibers and
transfers part of its energy to a proton, which produces
scintillations  in  the  fiber.  A  fraction  of  this  light

travels along the fiber and is emitted at its ends. The
light  is  transported  via  a  front-coated  mirror  and
large-aperture  lens  to  an  optical  detection  system.  In
the  present  work,  the  performance  of  the  screen  was
characterized  by  calculating  neutron  conversion
efficiencies, using tabulated cross-sections for H and C.
The GEANT code was used to determine emitted light
yields and the position resolution.

3.1 Neutron conversion efficiency and light emission

The  conversion  efficiency,  i.e.,  the  probability  of
creating  a  knock-on  proton  (from  hydrogen)  per
incident  neutron,  was  calculated  using  known  cross-
sections  for  reactions  on  hydrogen  and  carbon.  The
ratio  of  H/C  in  polystyrene  is  1  and  the  density  is
1.05 g/cc[6]. Fig. 8 shows the detection efficiency of
the  polystyrene  scintillator  vs.  neutron  energy  for
detector  thicknesses  of  10,  20,  50  and  100  mm.  The
fluctuations visible, especially for the thicker screens,
are due to resonances in the carbon cross-section.

deposited  by  the  protons  in  the  fibers.  The  average
proton  energy  is  0.78,  2.44  and  3.22  MeV  for  the  2,
7.5 and 14 MeV neutrons, respectively.

Using  the  known  entrance  and  exit  energies  of
each  proton  in  the  fiber  we  have  also  calculated  the
number  of  light  photons  created  in  the  fiber  by  the
incident neutrons, using the non-linear proton-energy
to-light  conversion  relation  for  a  plastic  scintillator
[7]. The average amounts of light created in the fiber
were 2600, 10,600 and 17,400 light photons for 2, 7.5
and 14 MeV neutrons, respectively.

The  calculated  detection  efficiency  of  a  20  mm

thick screen is about 10% at 7.5 MeV.

In  order  to  determine  the  distribution  of  energy
deposited in the fibers and the amount of light created
by  the  neutrons,  we  have  performed  a  GEANT
simulation of the energy deposited by the protons in a
0.5x0.5 mm2 pixel of a fiber screen, 200x200x20 mm3
in  dimensions.  In  the  simulation,  this  screen  was

neutron beam, incident normal to its surface. The fiber
dimensions  were  50x50  ìm2.  The  amount  of  light
created in the irradiated fiber and those adjacent to it
fibers was determined. The light in the  neighbouring
fibers  is  created  by  protons  crossing  from  the
irradiated  fiber  to  its  neighbours  and  by  scattered
neutrons.  Possible  cross-talk  of  light  from  fiber  to
fiber was not taken into account in these calculations.

The MTF of the 2 MeV neutrons is excellent, due to

4. Conclusions

The  performance  of  neutron  converters  for  two
fast  neutron  imaging  detector  variants  was  analyzed
using  Monte  Carlo  methods.  In  order  to  achieve  a
neutron  efficiency  comparable  with  the  OTIFANTI
variant,  a  significant  number  of  detector  units  of  the
FANGAS variant would have to be stacked.

Moreover,  the  intrinsic  position  resolution  of
OTIFANTI appears to be significantly better than that
of FANGAS. However, the cross-talk of light between
the  fibers  in  OTIFANTI  is  likely  to  degrade  the
position resolution somewhat.

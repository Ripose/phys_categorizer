PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE DESIGN  
OF THE INTERACTION REGION

Abstract 

 The  design  of  an  Interaction  Region  (IR)  suitable  to 
reach  low  values  of  the  β  functions  at  the  Interaction 
Point  (IP)  and  a  high  collision  frequency  is  a  rather 
difficult  task  in  a  short  ring  as  DAΦNE,  where  an 
upgrade  of  the  peak  luminosity  to  1034  cm-2s-1  is  aimed 
[1]. In the following, general considerations on the design 
of  such  an  IR  are  presented,  together  with  a  preliminary 
design;  the  final  design  will  however  be  the  result  of  a 
joint  collaboration  between  accelerator  and  detector 
physicists. 

IR DESIGN REQUIREMENTS AND 
CONSTRAINTS 

Design  requirements  and  constraints  depend  mainly 
on the geometry of the detector and on the value of the β 
functions  at 
the  IP.  Since  machine  and  detector 
requirements are often conflicting the IR geometry will be 
a  trade-off  between  them.  In  the  following  a  list  of  the 
main items to be studied is presented, with a D label for 
detector  requirements  or  constraints,  and  with  an  M  for 
machine  ones.  This  list  is  probably  not  exhaustive  of  all 
the  IR  design  problems,  but  is  just  intended  to  give  an 
idea of the actual difficulties we have to face. 
a)  The  detector  needs  a  free  solid  angle  as  large  as 
possible.  This  means  not  only  that  the  accelerator 
components  should occupy  the  smallest  cone  around  the 
beam pipe, but also that they should be kept as far away 
from  the  IP  as  reasonably  possible  (D)  to  allow  for  the 
installation  of  a  vertex  detector.  However 
is 
conflicting with the request to… 
b)  push the first vertical focusing quadrupole as close to 
the IP as possible, to minimize the beam spot size (M).  
c)  One  of  the  tools  to  reach  high  peak  luminosity  is  to 
increase the collision frequency. This translates, for a flat 
beam,  into  the  necessity  of  introducing  a  horizontal 
crossing angle (M). The choice of its value is critical and 
will be discussed in detail in the following section.  
d)  The detector needs to have a large solenoidal field to 
reconstruct  the  particle  kinematics  (D).  This  is  a  very 
large  perturbation  for  a  low  energy  beam,  however  this 
has  been  successfully  addressed  and  solved  in  DAΦNE, 
where a coupling as low as 0.2 % has been reached, so… 
e)  …a  smart  coupling  correction  scheme  has  to  be 
designed (M).   
f)  The IR quadrupoles should have very small size to fit 
in a small cone (D) but… 
g)  …the  closest  they  are  to  the  IP,  the  larger  are  their 
gradients  (M).  All  or  some  of  them  will  need  to  be

reduce  Ks 

regeneration  and 

embedded  in  the  detector  field.  Chromaticity  correction 
can be an issue for very low values of βy*. 
h)  Adequate  shielding  from  the  beam  backgrounds 
should be provided (D+M). Due to the low energy of the 
beams,  in  DAΦNE  the  main  source  of  backgrounds  are 
the  Touschek  scattered  particles.  Dedicated  simulations 
to  design  masks  and  collimators  are  needed  (M).  The 
DAΦNE experience will be very useful also in this field. 
i)  To 
improve 
interferometry a very thin beam pipe, with a large radius 
(10 cm) around the IP, is appreciated (D). 
j)  Ultra-vacuum  is  needed  and  the  number,  dimension, 
position  and  type  of  vacuum  pumps  has  to  be  carefully 
studied (M). 
k)  The  impedance  budget  of  the  vacuum  pipe  has  to  be 
computed taking into account all the possible sources of 
impedance  and  trying  to  minimize  them  (M).  This work 
has  been  accomplished  for  the  present  DAΦNE  IR  with 
good results. 
l)  An  “instrumented”  beam  pipe,  with  a  calorimeter  as 
close to the IP and to the beam pipe as feasible, is needed 
(D). 

to 

From  all  the  previous  points  it  is  clear  that  the  IR 
design needs to be studied from many points of view. The 
recipe should include geometry considerations and beam-
beam  simulations  that  are  needed  to  set  the  design beam 
parameters (β, σ) at the IP. Of course such a complicate 
design  has  to  be  carried  out  in  collaboration  with  the 
detector physicists. 

CROSSING ANGLE CHOICE 

The crossing angle geometry has many advantages: it 
allows  for  a  higher  collision  frequency  (so  that  a  larger 
number of bunches can collide), the beams are “naturally” 
separated  as  soon  as  they  leave  the  collision  point  (so 
there is no need for dipoles close to the IP) and the beams 
can be sooner accommodated in two separate rings. These 
are  the  reasons  why  “factories”,  as  DAΦNE,  CESR  and 
KEK-B,  have  chosen  it.  However  the  crossing  angle 
geometry has also many drawbacks.  

First of all, the bunch spacing is reduced so the beams 
travel  in  the  same  pipe  with  a  small  separation  and  can 
interact  with  destructive  effects.  This  is  the  ‘parasitic 
crossing’ (PC) issue: a distance between beam cores of at 
least 10 σx is required at the first PC (the most harmful) 
in order not to have the beam tails seeing each other, with 
a consequent decrease in lifetime.  

Perhaps  a  more  important  effect  is  the  reduction  in 
luminosity  and  tune  shifts  due  to  the  PC  collision.  This 
item,  which  also  depends  on  the  value  of  the  beams 

scattered  particles  can  be  lost  inside  the  IR  [3].  Clearly 
the  larger  the  crossing  angle,  the  larger  is  the  requested 
aperture.  The  resulting  crossing  angle  will  be  a 
compromise  between  minimum  aperture,  maximum 
lifetime, minimum backgrounds and maximum free solid 
angle for the detector.  

PARASITIC CROSSINGS EFFECT 

The  tune  shifts  due  to  the  PCs  can  be  estimated,  for 

Gaussian beams, by [1]:

where  x  and  y  are  the  horizontal  and  vertical  beam 
separation,  N  is  the  number  of  particles  in  the  opposite 
bunch.  It  can  be  seen  from  these  formulae  how  it  is  just 
the  absolute  value  of  the  separation  that  counts  from  the 
beam-beam  point  of  view,  and  not  the  number  of  σx, 
which limits the lifetime instead.  

As an example, a crossing angle of ±30 mrad has been 
chosen  to  evaluate  the  importance  of  the  PC  tune  shift 
with respect to the IP one.  In Fig. 1 the absolute value of 
the  PC  ξy,  normalized  to  the  IP  one,  is  plotted  as  a 
function of the PCs position in the IR. The PC tune shift 
contribution  has  to  be  counted  twice  since  each  bunch 
experiences a PC collision on both sides of the IP.  

Tune shift at PCs

separation  (absolute,  not  in  number  of  σx)  will  be 
addressed in the following section. 

Moreover with a large crossing angle, highly desirable 
from  a  “geometric”  point  of  view,  synchro-betatron 
resonances  which  couple  the  transverse  and  longitudinal 
phase  space  can  be  excited,  with  a  resulting  increase  of 
the  beam  spot  size  at  the  IP  and  a  consequently  lower 
luminosity. The Piwinski angle, defined as: 

φ = θ σz/σx 
where  θ  is  the  half  crossing  angle  and  σx  and  σz  are  the 
horizontal  and  longitudinal  beam  sizes,  is  a  parameter 
used to estimate how dangerous the crossing angle can be. 
Up to now DAΦNE (φ =0.29) and KEK-B (φ =0.57) are 
the storage rings where φ has reached higher values with 
some  loss  in  luminosity  due  to  beam  blow  up  but  no 
destructive  effects;  however  this  parameter  should  in 
general  be  kept  as  low  as  possible,  and  it  could  be  a 
limitation when trying to reach very high beam-beam tune 
shift values. 

The parameters used in the following considerations are 

summarized in Table 1.

The minimum value for the crossing angle can be set by 
imposing that at the first PC the two beams have a safe 20 
σx separation. With the chosen parameters we have: 

θmin = ±15 mrad 
On the other hand the maximum value of θ is dictated 
by  the  detector  request  that  the  machine  components 
occupy just a ± 9° cone around the IP (present design for 
the  KLOE  detector  at  DAΦNE).  The  value  of  the  angle 
then  depends  on  the  distance  L*  of  the  first  quadrupole 
from  the  IP.  By  choosing  L*  =  0.2  m  (a  very  short 
distance  indeed)  and  a  small  dimension  quadrupole  with 
an aperture of ±10 σx, we get: 

θmax = ±50 mrad 
Within  these  two  values  the  Piwinski  angle  will  range 
between 0.18 and 0.63. Of course by reducing σz we can 
decrease the Piwinski angle to a safer value. 

Another problem of large crossing angles comes by the 
off-axis  trajectory  in  the  magnetic  elements,  where  the 
field quality degrades. Non-linear fields and fringing field 
effects have then to be carefully taken into account when 
modelling the beam trajectory. 

The  choice  of  the  beam  pipe  aperture  is  also  very 
important,  since  it  affects  not  only  the  quadrupole  sizes, 
but  also  the  Touschek  beam  lifetime  [2],  since  the

It  is  obvious  that  the  main  contribution  (a  2%  effect) 
comes  from  the  first  PC, where  the  separation  is  smaller 
(20 σx for a ±30 mrad crossing angle). The second PC has 

tune  shifts.  In  Fig.  3  the  luminosity  for  a  finite  crossing 
angle,  normalized  to  the  head-on  case  is  plotted  as  a 
function of the βx* for three crossing angle values.

As  it  is  shown  in  the  luminosity  formula  above,  the 
effective horizontal beam size is increased by a factor (σz 
tg (θ/2)), with a consequent reduction of luminosity of the 
order  of  14%  for  the  design  βx  =  0.5  m  and  an  angle  of 
±50  mrad.  In  this  calculation  a  ratio  100  between 
horizontal and vertical β at the IP has been taken, while to 
minimize the hourglass effect a bunch length equal to the 
βy* is taken.  

The tune shifts reduction computed from the previous 
formulae  and  normalized  to  the  design  tune  shifts,  as  a 
function of the horizontal β at the IP, are plotted in Figs. 4

a 0.4% effect only. The others are clearly negligible. The 
effect on the horizontal tune shift is a factor of 20 lower, 
due  to  its  smaller  βx  value.  It  has  to  be  confirmed  by  a 
beam-beam  simulation  that  2%  will  not  have  a  dramatic 
effect  on  the  total  tune  shifts.  Smaller  values  of  the 
crossing angle will give a more important contribution (a 
10%  for  15  mrad),  larger  will  of  course  have  much  less 
impact (0.8% for 50 mrad), as it is shown in Fig. 2, where 
only  the  contribution  from  the  first  PC  is  taken  into 
account as a function of the crossing angle.

LUMINOSITY AND TUNE SHIFTS 
The  effect  of  a  finite  crossing  angle  on  the  luminosity 
and beam-beam tune shifts needs also to be studied with 
beam-beam  simulations,  however  to  give  a  first  estimate 
we  can  use    the  following  formulae  [5],  valid  for  any

angle  (normalized  to  design  value)  vs  βx*  for  different 
crossing angles. 

 
The vertical tune shift is reduced by the same factor as 
the luminosity, while the horizontal one drops faster. Due 
to  this  reduction,  the  beam  footprint  is  smaller,  so  in 
principle  we  could  still  increase  the  luminosity  by 
increasing the beam current.  

To  have  a  more  clear  picture  of  the  problem,  Fig.  6

versus  the  crossing  angle, for  the design values  of   βx*=

about 14% for the larger angle.

As  a  conclusion  on  the  crossing  angle  choice,  we  can 
say that quite a number of items enter in the game. They 
are: 

•  IR geometry 
•  Apertures  
•  PC effect on lifetime 
•  PC effect on beam-beam tune shifts 
•  Luminosity and tune shifts reduction 
•  Background studies  
 
The choice will mostly depend on the trade-off between 
the number of colliding bunches and the reduction in tune 
shifts  and 
tolerable.

EXAMPLE OF AN IR LAYOUT 

As  an  example  an  IR  design  is  presented  in  the 
following.  A  list  of  the  main  parameters  that  have  been 
preliminarily chosen is in Table 2.

A  two  triplets  D-F-D  configuration  has  been  chosen. 
The  basic  principle  is  to  separate  the  two  beam  lines  as 
soon  as  possible,  for  this  reason  a  ±30  mrad  crossing 
angle  was  chosen.  In  this  scheme  the  first  quadrupole 
(QD1, horizontally defocusing) is shared by both beams, 
while the second and third (QF2, QD3) should be already 

accommodated  on  separate  beam  lines.  The  beams  pass 
off-axis  in QD1  and  on-axis in  QF2  and  QD3. With  this 
geometry the beams separation at the entrance of QF2 is 
about 14 cm, at QD3 is about 60 cm, while at the IR end 
is  about  74  cm.  Due  to  the  small  space  available  the 
permanent  magnets  choice  is  mandatory,  a  quadrupole 
similar to the CESR one [6] is a possible choice. Due to 
the ±9° cone constraint and the small crossing angle, the 
quadrupole  dimensions  are  extremely  small.    Moreover 
due  to  the  small  value  of  L*,  the  distance  of  QD1  from 
the IP, this quadrupole has to have an external radius of 3 
cm, a pole radius of 1.5 cm and a thickness of 1.5 cm of 
pm material, very challenging values but still sufficient to 
provide  the  needed  gradient,  about  40  T/m.  A  sketch  of 
half IR is shown in Fig. 8. The optical functions and beam 
half-separation,  in  half  IR,  are  shown  in  Figs.  9  and  10 
respectively.

In  Table  II  the  quadrupoles  characteristics  are 
summarized.  The  space  available  to  separate  the  two 
beam lines between the two QF2 quadrupoles is only 4 
cm  in  this  configuration,  while  there  is  a  25  cm  space 
available between the two QD3. This last could even be 
of  a  normal  conducting  type,  used  for  matching  the 
optical functions outside the IR. A technical design will 
be needed in order to check for the feasibility of such a 
design.

The flexibility of the IR versus the βy* value from 1.5 
to  5  mm,  while  keeping  the  same  quadrupole  strengths, 
has been checked... The βy variation at the end of the IR 
ranges  between  0.7  and  2.  m,  easily  matched  to  the  ring 
optical  functions  by  adjusting  the  cell  quadrupoles  or 
QD3. In Fig. 11 the βy behaviour in half IR is plotted for 
different  IP  βy  values.  The  red  line  corresponds  to  the 
design βy* value of 4 mm.

COUPLING CORRECTION 
The  coupling  correction  depends  of  course  on  the 
detector field value. At 510 MeV the beam rotation due to 
the solenoidal field is a large perturbation to the optics. In 
principle  eight  parameters  are  needed  to  decouple  the 
whole IR transfer matrix, to have minimum coupling both 
at  the  IP  and  outside  the  IR.  The  present  DAΦNE 
correction  scheme  for  the  KLOE  detector,  where  all  IR 
quadrupoles  are  embedded  in  the  detector  field,  consists 
in  each 
of  2  compensating  solenoids  plus  a 
quadrupole,  proportional  to  the  field  integral  at  the 
quadrupole location, and of fine adjustments of the skew 
quadrupoles outside the IR. This scheme has proven to be

very  efficient,  allowing  for  lowering  the  coupling  to  a 
value of about 2x10-3. 

The new IR example has two quadrupoles immersed in 
the  detector  field,  this  means  that  2  compensating 
solenoids + 4 quadrupole tilts + 2 skew quadrupole in IR 
(can  be  the  QD3)  +  skew  quadrupoles  outside  IR  are 
needed.  Once  the  IR  design  has  been  finalized  and  the 
value of the detector field has been chosen, the correction 
scheme will be studied.  

CONCLUSIONS 
A  preliminary  study  of  a  simple  design  of  an  IR 
suitable for a high luminosity DAΦNE upgrade has been 
presented.  A  more  detailed  study  is  in  progress  and  in 
particular the following items need to be addressed in the 
future: 
 
•  technical IR design; 
•  study of the pm quadrupoles; 
•  chromaticity correction study; 
•  aperture definition; 
•  background evaluation; 
•  beam pipe design; 

 
 

•  vacuum design; 
•  impedance budget; 
•  trapped HOM study; 
•  temperature control.

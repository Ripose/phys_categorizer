Abstract. We study the relative index of two orthogonal inﬁnite dimensional projections which, in
the ﬁnite dimensional case, is the diﬀerence in their dimensions. We relate the relative index to the
Fredholm index of appropriate operators, discuss its basic properties, and obtain various formulas for
it. We apply the relative index to counting the change in the number of electrons below the Fermi
energy of certain quantum systems and interpret it as the charge deﬁciency. We study the relation of
the charge deﬁciency with the notion of adiabatic charge transport that arises from the consideration of
the adiabatic curvature. It is shown that, under a certain covariance, (homogeneity), condition the two
are related. The relative index is related to Bellissard’s theory of the Integer Hall eﬀect. For Landau
Hamiltonians the relative index is computed explicitly for all Landau levels.

1. Introduction

An interesting observation that emerged in the last decade is that charge transport in quantum
mechanics, in the absence of dissipation, often lends itself to geometric interpretation. A good part,
but not all, of this research has been motivated by, and applied to, the integer and fractional Hall
eﬀect [2,8,11,17,20,26,32,35,34,38,44].

The framework that will concern us here is that of (non-relativistic) quantum mechanics. Within
this framework common models of the integer Hall eﬀect are Schr¨odinger operators associated with
non interacting electrons in the plane, with (constant) magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the plane
and random (or periodic) potential. The Hall conductance has been related to a Fredholm Index by
Bellissard [5], and to a Chern number by Thouless, Kohmoto, Nightingale and den-Nijs [40]. The
Fractional Hall eﬀect is associated with electron-electron interaction and this goes beyond what we
do here.

Quantum ﬁeld theory is another framework where transport properties and geometry are related.
The focal point here has been the Fractional Hall eﬀect and the associated Chern-Simons ﬁeld
theories [7, 8,18,26,42,44] . We shall not address these issues.

The Chern number approach to quantum transport has been extended to a large class of quantum
mechanical systems, including models of the integer Hall eﬀect [17,24,25, 29,30,31,41], to models
with electron-electron interactions [3,23,30] and to other systems that bear only little resemblance
to the Integer Hall eﬀect [8,14,29,35,38]. The Index approach has not been as popular, and has not

been substantially extended beyond the one electron setting considered by Bellissard for the integer
Hall eﬀect [5,11,28,45].

We have two main purposes in this work. The ﬁrst is to develop the Index approach from the
physical point of view of “charge deﬁciency”: Consider a quantum system of (non-interacting)
electrons where the Fermi energy is in a gap. We allow an inﬁnitely large number of electrons
below the Fermi energy. Now consider taking this system through a cycle, so that at the end of the
cycle the Schr¨odinger operator is unitarily related to the one at the outset. The examples we shall
focus on here are where the initial and ﬁnal systems are related by a singular gauge transformation
corresponding to piercing the system with an inﬁnitesimally thin ﬂux tube, carrying one unit of
quantum ﬂux. Because of the unitary equivalence, at the end of the cycle we can put the Fermi
energy in the same gap as at the outset, and can ask for the diﬀerence in the number of electrons
below the Fermi energy. This deﬁciency of charge counts the charge transported in or out of the
system as a result of the additional ﬂux quantum. In interesting cases this diﬀerence is ∞ − ∞. For
non-interacting electrons, such a diﬀerence is the diﬀerence in dimensions of a pair of two inﬁnite
dimensional Hilbert space projections. This is the relative index. It turns out to be related to an
index of an appropriate Fredholm operator. In particular, it is an integer. (The charge deﬁciency
introduced here is reminiscent of a charge that enters in computing the vacuum polarization in Fock
space. See [27].)

The identiﬁcation of charge deﬁciency with an index implies integral charge transport. This holds
for a wide class of two dimensional quantum system, including the conventional models of the integer
Hall eﬀect mentioned above. But it also holds for also more general models whose geometries and
background potentials may be far removed from the Integer Hall eﬀect.

The theory described below appears to be restricted, at the moment at least, to non-interacting
electrons. This is consistent with the common wisdom because electron-electron interaction will, in
general, lead to fractional transport.

Our second purpose is to examine the relation of the charge deﬁciency (associated with an index)
and the notion of charge transport that arises in theories of linear and adiabatic response. The latter
is associated with Kubo’s formulae, Chern numbers and adiabatic curvatures. These two notions
are distinct in general. They turn out to be related for homogeneous systems. These are the kind
of systems relevant to the Integer Hall eﬀect.

This relation between charge deﬁciency and charge transport is reminiscent of known identities in
related contexts: ˇStreda’s formula (which is relating that the Hall conductance with a gap label)
[39] and certain Ward identities in Chern-Simons ﬁelds theories giving rise to relations between
transport coeﬃcients in linear response theory [18,42].

2. Comparing Dimensions

In this section we describe various formulas for comparing dimensions of two orthogonal projections,
P and Q. The index for two projectors of ﬁnite rank is just the diﬀerence of their dimensions.

Index (P, Q) ≡ dim P − dim Q = T r (P − Q)

(2.1)

A possible and, as we shall see, natural generalization of (2.1) to the inﬁnite dimensional case is:
2

Deﬁnition (2.1). Let P and Q be orthogonal projections so that P − Q is compact, then

Ker (P − Q − 1)
Index (P, Q) ≡ dim
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

− dim

.
Ker (Q − P − 1)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

(2.2)

are both ﬁnite by the compact-
This Index is a well deﬁned ﬁnite integer since dim
ness of P − Q. (One could take a broader perspective and deﬁne the left hand side of 2.2 by the right
hand side whenever the latter makes sense). Before we discuss in what sense 2.2 is a generalization
of 2.1 we note that the relative index indeed has some of the natural properties of an object that
compares dimensions of two projections:

Ker(P − Q ± 1)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

Index (P, Q) = −Index (Q, P ) = −Index (P⊥, Q⊥) = Index (U P U −1, U QU −1),
P⊥ ≡ 1 − P , Q⊥ ≡ 1 − Q,

(2.3)

for any linear and invertible map U . The basic formulas for computing the relative Index is:

Proposition (2.2). Suppose that (P − Q)2n+1 is trace class for a natural number n, then

Index (P, Q) = T r (P − Q)2n+1.

It follows that the right hand side of 2.4 is independent of n for n large enough, and that it reduces
to 2.1 in the ﬁnite dimensional case. We shall return to the proof of this proposition shortly.

To see where (2.4) comes, we start by noting an algebraic identity for any pair of projections P and
Q:

(P − Q)2P = P − P QP = P Q⊥P = P (P − Q)2.

In particular this says that (P − Q)2 commutes with P and Q. This leads to:

Proposition (2.3). Let n be a nonnegative integer so that (P − Q)2n+1 is trace class, then:

T r (P − Q)2n+3 = T r (P − Q)2n+1.

Proof. Subtracting the two equations below from each other

(P − Q)2n+2P = (P − Q)2n(P − P QP )
(P − Q)2n+2Q = (P − Q)2n(Q − QP Q),

(P − Q)2n+3 = (P − Q)2n+1 − (P − Q)2n[P Q, QP ].

gives

Since:

we get, due to equation (2.5), the identity:

[P Q, QP ] =

P Q, [Q, P ]
i
h

=

,
P Q, [Q, P − Q]
i
h

(P − Q)2n+3 = (P − Q)2n+1 − [P Q, B], B ≡

Q, (P − Q)2n+1
(cid:2)

(cid:3)

.

(2.10)

P Q is bounded and B is trace class, so T r [P Q, B] = 0. Tracing (2.10) gives (2.6). (cid:3)

In the applications we never go beyond the trace class situation discussed above, in fact the case
n = 1 covers all the cases we shall consider.

(P − Q)2m+1
Proof of Proposition 2.2. (2.6) implies that T r
is independent of m for m ≥ 0.
As m goes to inﬁnity, this trace converges to Index (P, Q) since −1 ≤ P − Q ≤ 1. Thus (2.4) is
(cid:0)
proven. (cid:3)

(cid:1)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

In future work we’ll examine this result further providing several other proofs which illuminate it.

In the applications we consider projectors P and Q on subspaces with energies below some ﬁxed
Fermi energy. Index (P, Q) then counts the diﬀerence in the number of electrons, which we identify
with the charge deﬁciency. Physical considerations, that we shall describe in the following sections,
motivate considering P and Q which are related by a unitary U :

Q = U P U ∗.

(2.11)

In the ﬁnite dimensional case P and Q are related by a unitary if and only if their dimensions
coincide.
In the inﬁnite dimensional case of a separable Hilbert space with dimP = dimP⊥ =
dimQ = dimQ⊥ = ∞ such a U always exists, and does not force Index (P, Q) = 0.

In the case that P and Q are related by a unitary map the index of the pair can be related to a
Fredholm index of one single operator:

Proposition(2.4). Let Q = U P U ∗, P an orthogonal projections and U unitary and suppose that
(P − Q)2n+1 is trace class. Then, T r (P − P QP )n+1 and T r (Q − QP Q)n+1 are trace class; P U P
is a Fredholm operator in range P and

Index (P, Q) = T r ([P, U ]U ∗)2n+1 = T r (P − P QP )n+1 − T r (Q − QP Q)n+1

= −

dimKer(U |RangeP ) − dimKer(U ∗|RangeP )
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

≡ −Index (P U P ).

Proof. The ﬁrst identity is a rewrite of (2.4) upon noting that

P − Q = [P, U ]U ∗.

The second identity follows from (2.5) which gives:

(P − P QP )n+1 = ((P − Q)2P )n+1 = (P − Q)2n+2P
(Q − QP Q)n+1 = ((P − Q)2Q)n+1 = (P − Q)2n+2Q,

(proving our trace class assertion), subtracting and tracing using (2.4) and (2.6) gives the second
identity. To get the third identity note that:

P − P QP = P − P U P U ∗P
Q − QP Q = U (P − P U ∗P U P )U ∗,

using the unitary invariance of the trace we see that the third term in (2.12) can be written as:

T r (P − P U P U ∗P )n+1 − T r (P − P U ∗P U P )n+1.

Since both terms are ﬁnite the operators (P U P ) and (P U ∗P ) are inverses of each other in range P
up to compacts. A formula of Fedosov [ 19,16] then says that under such circumstances (2.16) is a
formula for Index (P U ∗P ) respectively −Index (P U P ). (cid:3)

We can now use the relation Index (P, Q) = −Index (P U P ), to transfer known facts about the
Fredholm Index to the relative index, and vice versa.

Proposition (2.5). Let P, Q, R be orthogonal projections, which diﬀer by compacts. Then

Index (P, R) = Index (P, Q) + Index (Q, R).
4

(2.17)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

This identity is, of course, trivial in the situation where P, Q, R diﬀer by trace class operators. When
interpreted as charge deﬁciency, it is a statement of charge (or particle) conservation.

Proof. For simplicity we suppose that P, Q and R are unitarily related. Elsewhere we shall give a
proof of the general case.

Eq. 2.17 equivalent to:

Index (P (U2U1)P ) = Index (P U1P ) + Index (QU2Q).

(2.18)

Now we rewrite all expressions in terms of Q and the necessary unitaries:

Index (P U2U1P ) = Index (U −1

1 QU1U2QU1)

= Index (QU1U2Q)

Index (P U1P ) = Index (U −1

1 QU1QU1)

= Index (QU1Q)

Hence it remains to show

Index (QU1U2Q) = Index (QU1Q) + Index (QU2Q)

(2.19)

The left hand side can be replaced by Index (QU1QU2Q) because the diﬀerence of the corresponding
operators is compact,

QU1QU2Q − QU1U2Q = Q[U1, Q]U −1

1 U1U2Q.

This follows from the compactness of [U1, Q]U −1
and the fact that all the remaining terms are
1
bounded. By a basic result of stability theory for indices [22] the index is invariant under pertur-
bations by compacts. Furthermore by the product formula for Fredholm indices one gets

Index (QU1QU2Q) = Index(QU1Q) + Index (QU2Q),

(2.20)

This proves the proposition. (cid:3)

Related questions are addressed in [9,12,15].

3. Gauge Transformations and Computations with Integral Kernels

In this section we introduce additional structure into the general operator theoretic framework of the
previous section, which will accompany us throughout. It is motivated by the applications we have
in mind, and involves conditions on the kind of projections we consider and the unitaries that relate
them. In particular, the unitary that relates the orthogonal projections P and Q will be associated
with a (singular) gauge transformation which corresponds to piercing the quantum system with a
ﬂux tube carrying an integral number of ﬂux quanta. That is, U is a unitary multiplication operator
whose winding is the number of ﬂux quanta carried by the ﬂux tube. (More precise conditions will
be stated shortly). This naturally forces us into considering two dimensional quantum systems.
Furthermore, it turns out, that for Index (P, Q) 6= 0 the orthogonal projection P has to be inﬁnite
dimensional and time reversal invariance must be broken.

We describe this additional structure under

5

Hypothesis (3.1).
(a) The Hilbert space is L2(Ω) where Ω j R2 is a two dimensional domain in R2 with smooth
(possibly empty) boundary ∂Ω. In particular, the orthogonal projections P and Q of the previous
section are projections in L2(Ω).
(b) The projection P has integral kernel p(x, y), x, y ∈ Ω, which is jointly continuous in x and y
and decays away from the diagonal, so that:

with η > 2 and dis(x, y) is the distance between x and y.
(c) U is a multiplication operator on L2(Ω) by a complex valued function u(x), with |u(x)| = 1, and
u(x) is diﬀerentiable away from a single point which we take to be x = 0. The derivative is O( 1
|x| ).
More precisely, we assume that there are constants C1 and C2 such that:

for |x| ≤ C2 |y|. The winding number of U about the singularity is denoted by N (U ). This is the
number of magnetic ﬂux quanta carried by the ﬂux tube associated with U .

are unitaries which, for integer α, are smooth away from the origin and have winding number α.
Such unitaries are associated with an inﬁnitesimally thin ﬂux tubes through the origin carrying α
units of quantum ﬂux. In particular, for α = 1 condition c above holds with C1 = C−1
2 = 2. This
follows from the elementary inequality |u1(z) − u1(z′)| ≤ |z − z′| max( 1
|z′| ), which implies (3.2).
On the other hand, if α 6∈ Z, condition c clearly fails near the positive real axis.

|z| , 1



The fact that U is a gauge transformation distinguishes coordinate space, and in the rest of this
section the integral kernel of P − Q will play a role. In particular, we’d like to know that an object
like T r (P − Q)3 can be computed from the integral kernel of P − Q by integrating on the diagonal.
This somewhat technical issue is guaranteed by the following preparatory result:

Proposition (3.3). Let K be trace class with integral kernel K(x, y), x, y ∈ Rn, which is jointly
continuous in x and y away from a ﬁnite set of points (xi, yi) so that K(x, x) ∈ L1 in neighborhoods
of these points, then:

T r K =

K(x, x) dx

Z
Rn

(3.4)

Sketch of proof. Let Eǫ, Fǫ, Gǫ be the characteristic functions of the union of ǫ-balls about the
singular points, the exterior of a 1/ǫ ball and the complement of these two sets. Then

T r (K) = T r (EǫK) + T r (FǫK) + T r (GǫKGǫ)

(3.5)

where we used cyclicity of the trace to get the last term. Since Eǫ and Fǫ converge strongly to zero
as ǫ goes to 0, EǫK and FǫK go to zero in trace norm (as can be seen by writing K as a ﬁnite
rank plus small trace norm), and since a result in [36] says that T r (GǫKGǫ) is the integral over
Gǫ of K(x, x) the result follows by taking the limit using the fact that K(x, x) is L1. This proves
proposition (3.3). (cid:3)

Proposition (3.3) could be replaced by the following statement which is is a kind of a Lebesgue
integral version of proposition 3.3 [6]. Its application to the concrete cases we have in mind requires
however somewhat more care.

6

Remark (3.4). Let K be trace class on L2(Rn). Then, its integral kernel K(x, y) may be chosen
so that the function L(x, y) ≡ K(x, x + y) is a continuous function of y with values in L1(Rn).
Furthermore if l(y) ≡

L(x, y) dx then T r K = l(0).

Our ﬁrst application is the following result that guarantees that Index (P − Q) = 0 if P − Q is trace
class:

Proposition (3.5). Suppose P − Q is trace class with Q = U P U −1, U and P satisfying hypothesis
(3.1). Then Index (P, Q) = T r (P − Q) = 0.

Proof. The integral kernel of P − Q is:

(P − Q)(x, y) = p(x, y)

1 −

u(x)
u(y) (cid:17)

(cid:16)

(3.6)

By proposition (3.3), T r (P − Q) is the integral of (3.6) on the diagonal with x = y. But the kernel
of (P − Q) vanishes on the diagonal. Hence the trace is zero. (cid:3)

This means the trace class situation is like the ﬁnite dimensional case, i.e. unitary equivalence of P
and Q implies equality of dimensions in the generalized sense. In particular, for Index (P, Q) 6= 0,
(P − Q) must not be trace class, so dim P = dim Q = ∞.

The following proposition is central.

Proposition (3.6). Under hypothesis (3.1) (P − Q)p is trace class for p > 2.
T r (P − Q)3 is an integer and

2. The index is real, of course. Under complex conjugation the ﬁrst triple product in 3.7 becomes
p(y, x)p(z, y)p(x, z), since, by self adjointness ¯p(x, y) = p(y, x). The second triple product transforms
to
by the unimodularity of u(x). This reduces to the original integrand
upon interchanging x and z.
3. If we were to consider, for example, R3, then the integrand in 3.7, under hypothesis 3.1, would
lack decay in the direction of the magnetic ﬂux tube, and 3.7 would become meaningless, in general.
4. Flux tubes that carry fractional ﬂuxes are associated with unitaries of example 3.2 with α 6∈ Z.
For such U ’s, the integrand in 3.7 lacks decay along the cut, and the integral is divergent in general.

5. This proposition also tells us that, as far as section 2 is concerned, n = 1 is all we have to
consider.

Proof. By hypothesis (3.1) P − Q is an integral operator with kernel p(x, y)
that (P − Q)p , p > 2, is trace class it is enough to show that the function

because of Russo’s theorem [33]. To prove (3.8) notice that close to the diagonal x = 0 the second
term of the integrand in (3.8) is small, oﬀ the diagonal it is the ﬁrst one which is small. To put this

in analytic form we note ﬁrstly that it is enough to prove (3.8) in the following situation: Replace

by the function

1 − u(x+y)
u(y)
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

where C2 is the constant introduced in hypothesis (3.1); i.e. it is enough to prove

because, by construction, |p(x + y, y)

| is pointwise dominated by a constant multiple

(cid:17)
of f (x, y). Secondly we show that F is uniformly bounded in y.This follows from the y independent
bound on f (x, y),

together with ηq − 2 > 0 ( use η > 2 and q > 1 ). Hence the right hand side of 3.10 is integrable.
Thirdly we analyze the behavior of F for large y. To do that we split the deﬁning integral into two
pieces and prove that each term is in Lp−1(R). The ﬁrst term is deﬁned by

where I(y) ≡ {x| |x| ≤ C2|y|} denotes the domain close to the diagonal x = 0. By construction it
satisﬁes the estimate

Cutting out the unit ball B in I(y) we get the inequality

The second term is bounded up to a constant 2π by

Because (p − 1)q − 2 = p − 2 > 0 and (p − 1)(ηq − 2) − 2 = (η − 2)p > 0 both terms on the right

We close with the following observations about Index (P U P ). The ﬁrst is a statement of stability
of the relative index with respect to deformations of the ﬂux tube such as translating and other
local deformations, and is a consequence of the stability of the Fredholm index under compact
perturbations. We state one special case only:

(cid:1)
Sketch of Proof. P (U − T ∗U T ) is a compact operator. This can be seen by an adaptation of the
proof of proposition 3.6 to the present case. The stability of the index under compact perturbations
gives the ﬁrst equality. the second one follows from the invertibility of T and the deﬁnition of the
index. (cid:3)

(3.19)

This makes the charge deﬁciency insensitive to the positioning of the ﬂux tube, (and so a global
property of the system).

There are classes of projections where the relative index is guaranteed to vanish. Experience with ex-
amples, such as the quantum Hall eﬀect, have led to the recognition that nontrivial charge transport
is intimately connected with breaking time reversal symmetry. Indeed:

Theorem (3.9). Let U and P satisfy hypothesis 3.1 and P be time reversal invariant, then
Index (P U P ) = 0.

Proof. Since the relative index is real, 3.7 is even under conjugation. On the other hand, time
reversal invariance says that 3.7 is odd under conjugation., so the index must vanish. To see this,
recall that time reversal says that (in the spinless case) the integral kernel of P is real [43]. It follows
that the ﬁrst triple product in 3.7, p(x, y)p(y, z)p(z, x), is even under conjugation. The second triple
1 − u(y)
product of 3.7,
, is odd under conjugation, since u(x) is unimodular.
u(z)
It follows that the integrand in 3.7 is odd under conjugation. (cid:3)

Remark (3.10). It is easy to extend this proof to the case of spin, and to generalized notions of
time reversal.

The next triviality result has nothing to do with time reversal, but rather with the geometry of
Ω. It states that one can not remove too much of R2 around the ﬂux tube without making the
relative index trivial. In particular, if Ω is contained in a wedge, and the ﬂux is outside Ω, the index
vanishes. More precisely:

Theorem (3.11). Let U be a ﬂux tube through the origin so that U and P satisfy hypothesis 3.1,
and let Ω be contained in a wedge excluding the origin, i.e. Ω ⊂ {z|z ∈ C, ε < arg z < 2π−ε, ε > 0},
then, Index (P U P ) = 0.

Proof. Suppose Index (P U P ) = m, m 6= 0. Take V ≡ U 1/2m with cut along [0, ∞), and so entirely
outside Ω. Since P is a projection in L2(Ω), p(x, y) = 0 if either x or y is in Ω. Proposition 3.6 then
can be adapted to this case with V replacing U , using the fact that near the edges of the wedge
the decay in 3.1 replaces the decay in 3.2. It follows that Index (P V P ) must be an integer. On the
other hand a little argument, using proposition 2.5 and Eq. (2.3) shows that m = Index (P U P ) =
2m Index (P V P ). This is a contradiction. Hence m = 0. (cid:3)

4. Covariant Projections

In this section we consider the relative index for projections arising in the study of homogeneous
systems. Here we concentrate on the case of a single Hamiltonian. In section 8 we shall consider
9

families of Hamiltonians with random potentials which are covariant and ergodic under translation.
The random case is of course much more interesting from the point of view of applications to real
systems. Mathematically the case of one single covariant Hamiltonian is however the core of the
matter as it will be seen latter.

The main result of this section, theorem 4.2, gives a formula for Index (P U P ) which holds for
projections, which, in addition to the assumption on the decay of their integral kernel, 3.1, also
satisfy a condition of covariance (or homogeneity): Projections that are translation invariant up
to a gauge transformation. This formula plays a key role in relating the index to the adiabatic
curvature and Kubo’s formula, something we shall return to in the following sections.

Deﬁnition (4.1). We say that a projection P in L2(Rn) is covariant if its integral kernel satisﬁes:

p(x, y) = Ua(x)p(x − a, y − a) U −1

a (y) a, x, y ∈ Rn.

(4.1)

Ua(x) denotes a family of unitary continuously diﬀerentiable multiplication operators i.e. non-
singular gauge transformations.

This notion of covariance is motivated by the covariance for Schr¨odinger operators with constant
magnetic ﬁelds [46].

It follows that the ﬁrst triple product in the integrand in 3.7 is invariant under translation of all
arguments x,y,z.:

p(x, y)p(y, z)p(z, x) = p(x − t, y − t)p(y − t, z − t)p(z − t, x − t)

t ∈ R2

= p(0, y − x)p(y − x, z − x)p(z − x, 0).

(4.2)

This property can be used to reduce the six dimensional integral in the computation of Index (P U P )
in 3.7 to a four dimensional one, provided we can say something about two dimensional integrals
, where a, b and c are ﬁxed points in R2.
with the integrand
That such integrals can be evaluated explicitly, and have geometric signiﬁcance is a result of Connes
[11] and is a rather amazing fact. Lemma (4.4) is in part a simpliﬁcation of the derivation and a
generalization of the original observation of Connes to the case of singular gauge transformations
(Connes proof works however also for the upper half plane).

Theorem (4.2). Let P be a covariant projection in L2(R2) satisfying the decay properties 3.1 and
let U be a (singular) gauge transformation satisfying hypothesis (3.1), with winding N (U ). Then:

where x ∧ y ≡ x1y2 − x2y1, x ≡ (x1, x2) and y ≡ (y1, y2).

Remark (4.3). The self-adjointness of P gives p(x, y) = p(y, x), making the Index real. If p(x, y)
is real the index is manifestly 0, as it should (by theorem 3.9).

The proof of the theorem needs an evaluation of an integral.

hypothesis (3.1). Then:

C(a, b, c) has several manifest properties that want to make it proportional to the oriented area of
the triangle with vertices a, b, c: 1. It is even or odd under cyclic or anti cyclic permutations of
a, b, c respectively. 2. It is translation invariant:

C(a + t, b + t, c + t) = C(a, b, c),

a, b, c, t ∈ R2

(4.8)

This suggests looking at mixed second derivatives. There is a problem however with diﬀerentiability
of the integrand in the vicinity of a,b and c and with convergence of the integral at inﬁnity. For
that reason this bad set is cut out. Let Bε(a) denote the ball of radius ε around a and let Dε be
deﬁned by:

Dε ≡ B 1

ε (0)/(Bε(a) ∪ Bε(b) ∪ Bε(c)).

(4.9)

Dε is a large disk punctured near the three points a, b and c . C(a, b, c) is the ε → 0 limit of:

Cε(a, b, c) ≡

(cid:16)

Since Cε(a, b, c) changes sign if two of its arguments are interchanged, it is enough to look at the
anti-symmetric second derivatives, i.e. :

(∂a1 ∂b2 − ∂a2∂b1 )e(x − a, x − b)

The boundary ∂Dε is made of one large circle, and three tiny circles around the puncture at a, b
and c. In the limit ε → 0 the small circles around a, b, c do not contribute to the integral. The large
circle however produces the winding number up to the factor 2 (2πi).

An additional argument shows that the only non-vanishing second derivatives of C(a, b, c) are the
ones just considered (and their cyclic permutations) and that the limit ε → 0 and derivation may
be interchanged.

To reconstruct C(a, b, c) from its second derivatives we integrate 4.12 twice and get:

C(a, b, c) = α + β(a, b, c) − 2πiN (U ) Area(a, b, c)

(4.13)

where α is a constant and β a linear function. Since C(0, 0, 0) = 0, we learn that α = 0. Since
C(a, b, c) and Area(a, b, c) are even/odd under permutations of a, b, c, so is β(a, b, c). Since β is
linear it must vanish identically. This ﬁnishes the proof of Lemma (4.4). (cid:3)

. Now we return to the proof of Theorem (4.2). Using the previously introduced notation (4.6) and
translational invariance (4.2) in (3.7) one gets:

Index (P U P ) =

dy dz p(0, y)p(y, z)p(z, 0) C(0, −y, −z)

By Lemma (4.4) the proof is ﬁnished. (cid:3)

5. Charge Deﬁciency and Charge Pumps

The wave function of n non-interacting fermions gives rise to a n−dimensional projection in the
one particle Hilbert space. Therefore Index (P, Q) = dim P − dim Q counts the diﬀerence of the
corresponding number of fermions. We shall adopt the point of view that, with deﬁnition 2.1,
Index (P, Q) also correctly counts the diﬀerence in the number of Fermions associated with inﬁnite
dimensional projections P and Q.

Suppose we ﬁx the Fermi energy in a gap in the spectrum of the Schr¨odinger operator, and consider
the associated spectral projection P . We show in Appendix A that for a wide class of Schr¨odinger
operators, the integral kernel of P satisﬁes the decay and regularity hypothesis in section 3. (Pre-
sumably, these conditions are satisﬁed under weaker conditions, e.g.
in the absence of an energy
gap, but provided the Fermi energy is in a region of “localized states”). Let U be a singular gauge
transformation which introduces N (U ) ﬂux quanta into the system. Q = U P U ∗ describes the spec-
tral projection associated with the same Fermi energy, (also in a gap, by unitary invariance), with
extra N (U ) units of quantum ﬂux, piercing Ω at points. Hence Index (P, Q) counts the change in
the number of electrons below the Fermi energy.

It is clear from proposition (2.5), and is manifest in Theorem 4.2, that Index (P U P ) is linear in
the number of ﬂux quanta carried by the a ﬂux tube: If the ﬂux tube U1 adds charge q1 and U2
adds charge q2, then U1U2 would add (q1 + q2) charges. It is therefore natural to deﬁne the charge
deﬁciency in terms of what a ﬂux tube carrying one unit of quantum ﬂux does. And, for the sake
of concreteness we chose a speciﬁc (rotationally symmetric) ﬂux tube:

Deﬁnition (5.1). For a spectral projection P of a Schr¨odinger operator in L2(Ω), Ω ⊆ R2, and
z = x + iy, the charge deﬁciency is the Fredholm index Index (P z
|z| P ), whenever the latter is well
deﬁned.

In many simple cases the charge deﬁciency vanishes. Proposition 3.5 tells us that this is always the
case for (reasonable Schr¨odinger operators associated with) compact domains where the number of
12

electrons is ﬁnite. Nontrivial deﬁciency therefore requires an inﬁnite number of Fermions. Theorem
3.10 tells us that even for non-compact domains with inﬁnite number of Fermions, the deﬁciency
vanishes whenever the ﬂux tube is outside Ω and Ω is contained in a wedge. This leaves us with
inﬁnite domains that encircle the ﬂux tube. Finally, even for these, theorem 3.9 tells us that the
In particular, this is the case in the
deﬁciency vanishes whenever P is time reversal invariant.
absence of gauge ﬁelds.

It is now natural to ask whether there are examples of Schr¨odinger operators whose spectral projec-
tions have non-trivial deﬁciencies. One way to break time reversal is with constant magnetic ﬁelds.
As we shall see in section 7, the simplest example of this kind, the Landau Hamiltonian associated
with the Euclidean plane, has unit deﬁciency for each Landau level. It would be interesting to have
additional example where the deﬁciency is computable and non zero. In particular, it would be
interesting to have examples where time reversal is broken in more subtle ways, for example, with
Aharonov-Bohm ﬂuxes.

Charge pumps are quantum mechanical devices which transfers an integer charge in each cycle.
An interesting class of such pumps has been introduced by [29]. The kind of systems discussed in
this paper are also charge pumps. They have a natural cycle of one unit of quantum ﬂux and the
periodicity is exact for non-interacting electrons. As real electrons are pumped, the pump charges.
This may modify the eﬀective potential in the one electron theory, and ultimately change the index,
destroying the periodicity. Charging eﬀects are, of course, smaller the larger the capacitance of Ω.

A pump of the kind discussed here is stable in the sense that deformations in the domain Ω, the
potentials, the location of the ﬂux tube or the Fermi energy would preserve the deﬁciency.

To clarify the concept of charge deﬁcency for the pair of projectors P and Q = U P U −1 of the two
Schr¨odinger operators H and U HU −1 let us introduce a canonical interpolation between the two:

H(t) = (−i∇ − φ(t)(∇ arg z) − A0)2 + V,

t ∈ [0, 1]

where φ(t) interpolats smoothly between zero and one. ∇ arg z denotes a vector ﬁeld on the real
two plane respectively the complex plane. H(t) has, by deﬁnition, a time independent domain of
deﬁnition. It is not unitary equivalent to H through conjugation with U (t) = eit arg z because the
domain of H is not invariant under U (t) for t in the interior of the interval [0,1].

If we consider the time dependent dynamical system deﬁned by the Schr¨odinger operator H(t), it
is evident, that in addition to the magnetic ﬁeld B = ∇ × A0 there is an electric ﬁeld ˙φ(t)∇ arg z.
It points in the azymuthal direction. Hence a charge experiences a Lorentz force in radial direction
and is pushed from the center of the ﬂux tube to inﬁnity. This motivates the interpretation of P
and Q as physical states related through adiabatic dynamics of the time dependant Hamiltonian
H(t) and the terminology “charge deﬁciency”.

Much of the discussion above has analogs in the analysis of the quantum Hall eﬀect based on
localization of wave functions [26,20,32,41].

6. Adiabatic Curvature and Hall Conductance

In this section we discuss the Hall charge transport, which is a priori distinct from charge deﬁciency
discussed in previous sections. This notion is related to adiabatic curvature, Chern numbers, and
to Kubo’s formula. We describe this in some detail. The main result, theorem 6.6, says that under
appropriate conditions the Hall charge transport and charge deﬁciency are related.

As in our discussion of charge deﬁciency, we consider a cycle of Schr¨odinger operators associated
with a gauge transformation. However, the gauge transformation is not associated with a ﬂux tube
that pierces the system. Rather, it is associated with a (ﬁnite) voltage drop across the system whose
13

time integral is a unit of quantum ﬂux. This voltage drop is associated with a class of functions,
which we call switches and which, roughly, look like the graphs of 1

2 tanh(x). More precisely:

Deﬁnition (6.1). Λ(x), x ∈ R, a function of one variable, is called a switch if it is a continuously
diﬀerentiable, real valued, monotone, non- decreasing function such that the limits at +∞ and −∞
exist and

Λ(∞) − Λ(−∞) = 1.

(6.1)

The setting relevant to this section is described in the following:

Hypothesis (6.2). Consider the family of, unitarily equivalent, magnetic Schr¨odinger operators
in L2(R2),

H(A, V ) ≡ (−id − A)2 + V = ei (Φ1Λ1+Φ2Λ2)

(−id − A0)2 + V

e− i (Φ1Λ1+Φ2Λ2),
(cid:17)

(6.2)

A ≡ A0 + Φ1 dΛ1 + Φ2 dΛ2,

(cid:16)

where:

b)

a) A0 and V , the vector and scalar potentials, satisfy the (mild) regularity conditions in Appendix
A; Φ ≡ (Φ1, Φ2) ∈ R2 and Λ1, Λ2 are both switches.

P (Φ) = ei (Φ1Λ1+Φ2Λ2)P (0)e− i (Φ1Λ1+Φ2Λ2).

(6.3))

is a family of spectral projections for H(A, V ) associated with a Fermi energy in a gap in the
spectrum.

Remarks. 1. In Appendix A we show that b) of hypothesis 6.2 implies that the integral kernel of
P satisﬁes the regularity and decay properties in hypothesis 3.1.
2. In the case where Φ is time dependent,
voltage drop along the y-axis.
3. The monotonicity condition on the switch functions implies integrability of the derivative of
switches in the absolute sense and enters in the proof of proposition 6.9.

˙Φ1 is the voltage drop along the x-axis and ˙Φ2 is the

We recall:

Deﬁnition (6.3). The adiabatic curvature associated to P is:

ω12 ≡ i P [∂Φ1 P, ∂Φ2 P ] P.

(6.4)

A direct calculation gives:

ω12 = − i [P Λ1P, P Λ2P ] = i P [Λ1P⊥Λ2 − Λ2P⊥Λ1]P = i

[P, Λ1]P⊥[P, Λ2] − (1 ↔ 2)

(6.5)

(cid:16)

.
(cid:17)

Furthermore, since Λ1 and Λ2 are multiplication operators:

ω12(Φ) = ei (Φ1Λ1+Φ2Λ2)ω12(0)e− i (Φ1Λ1+Φ2Λ2).

(6.6)

It would be nice, if hypothesis 6.2 were to imply that the adiabatic curvature is trace class. Since
we do not know if this is the case, we shall study traces by taking limits. To this end we introduce:

Notation (6.4). Let Ω ⊂ R2 denote the square box [−L, L]×[−L, L], and let χΩ be the characteristic
function of the box. |Ω| denotes the area of the box.

The unitary equivalence of the family in 6.2, makes the adiabatic curvature Φ independent in the
following sense:

14

Proposition (6.5). Let P be a spectral projection associated with a gap, then χΩω12χΩ is trace
class and its trace is independent of Φ.

Proof. Since Λ1P⊥Λ2 − Λ2P⊥Λ1 is bounded it is enough to prove that χΩP is Hilbert- Schmidt
(recall that all Schatten classes are ideals). By the theorem in Appendix A the integral kernel of P
satisﬁes the decay properties (3.1). Consequently,

The Φ-independence is obvious from (6.6). (cid:3)

For our purpose, the most convenient way of introducing charge transport in the Hall eﬀect is to
deﬁne it by:

Deﬁnition (6.6). The Hall charge transport, Q, is

Q ≡ −2π lim
L→∞

T r χΩ ω12χL.

Remarks (6.7). a) Theorem 6.8 below guarantees the existence of the limit, under the conditions
in Hypothesis 6.2.
b) In our units, the Hall conductance is Q/2π.
c) Our sign convention is such that the Hall conductance of a full Landau level is 1/2π.

The physical interpretation of charge transport introduced here is the following. It is the charge
that crosses the x1 axis, in the positive direction, as the Hamiltonians in 6.2 undergo a cycle
corresponding to adiabatically increasing Φ1 from 0 to 2π. (Alternatively, it is minus the charge
that crosses the x2 axis as the Hamiltonians in 6.2 undergo a cycle corresponding to adiabatically
increasing Φ2 from 0 to 2π). This is the transport in the Hall eﬀect. For more on this the the reader
may want to consult [3,20,23,30,31].

The following theorem is the central result of this section. It says that the Hall conductance can
sometimes be interpreted as an index. The strategy is to show that deﬁnition 6.6 can be put into
the form of Theorem 4.2.

Theorem (6.8). Suppose P is a covariant projector, P and P, Λ1,2 satisfy the hypothesis 6.2. Then
the Hall charge transport Q equals the charge deﬁciency:

To compute the charge transport we have to integrate the above expression over the domain Ω and
after that let L → ∞. Since all integrations converge absolutely even for Ω = R2 we are permitted
to exchange the order of integration and the limit L → ∞. Hence we integrate ﬁrst over x, then we
let L → ∞ and then we integrate over y and z. The x integration can be done by b) of proposition

7. Landau Hamiltonians

It is instructive to consider an example where the theory of the previous section applies and, more-
over, is non trivial in the sense that it gives non-zero deﬁciency. Such an example is provided by
Landau Hamiltonians and the spectral projections on Landau levels. The Landau Hamiltonian in
L2(R2) is:

H(A) ≡

(− i d − A)2

1
2

(7.1)

2 B(2n+1) |n ∈ N},
where dA = B dx∧dy. B > 0 is a constant magnetic ﬁeld. Spectrum
and each point in the spectrum, a Landau level, is inﬁnitely degenerate. We shall denote the spectral
projection on the n-th Landau level by Pn. Clearly, dim Pn = ∞. We show below that projections
on Landau levels satisfy hypothesis 3.1, and that the charge deﬁciency of each Landau level is unity.

H(A)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

= { 1

Proposition (7.1). Let H(A) be the Landau Hamiltonian with B > 0, A diﬀerentiable and Pn the
projection on the n-th Landau level. Then pn(x, y) is covariant, jointly continuous in x and y, and
decays like a gaussian in the variable |x − y|. In particular, hypothesis (3.1) holds.

Proof. a) Let Ta denote the translation by a ∈ R2. Since B is constant and R2 is simply connected,
A(x − a) − A(x) = dΛa(x) = i U ∗

a dUa with Ua(x) ≡ exp −i Λa(x). It follows that

Ta H(A)T−a = (− i d − A(x − a))2 = (− i d − A(x) − dΛa(x))2 = U ∗

a H(A) Ua.

(7.2)

Hence H(B) commutes with magnetic translations Za ≡ UaTa [46]. The spectral projections are
covariant in the sense of section 4 and

p(x, y) = U −1

x (x) p(0, y − x) Ux(y).

(7.3)

b) With A and A′ related by a (continuous) gauge transformation Λ, A′ = A+dΛ, the corresponding
integral kernels are related by pA′ (x, y) = ei Λ(x)pA(x, y)e−i Λ(y), and so pA′ (x, y) is continuous in x
and y if pA(x, y) is. It is therefore enough to check the regularity and decay for a speciﬁc choice of A.
By scaling the coordinates, we may take B = 2. We shall now show that for A0 ≡ 1
2 (−y dx + x dy),
p0(0, z) = P olynomial(z) exp −|z|2/2. Which proves the regularity and decay. The corresponding
the Landau Hamiltonian is:

H(A0) = 2D∗D + 1, D ≡ (∂z +

),

z = x + iy.

z
2

The lowest Landau level is spanned by:

< z|n, 0 > = (πn!)−1/2zne−|z|

/2, n = 0, 1, . . .

2

and the m-th Landau level by

< z|n, m > = (πn!(m + 1)!)−1/2(D∗)m(zne−|z|

/2).

(7.4)

(7.5)

(7.6)

Since < 0|n, m >= 0 for m 6= n we have:

which is smooth andwith gaussian decay. (cid:3)

Xn

pm(0, z) =

< 0|n, m >< n, m|z > = < 0|m, m >< m, m|z >

(7.7)

It follows that the results of the previous sections apply. In particular, the deﬁciency is a ﬁnite
integer and the Hall conductance for the n-th Landau level is − 1
. It remains to
compute the index. This computation depends on the following simple lemma:

2π Index

Lemma (7.2). Let M be a semi-inﬁnite Fredholm matrix so that its non-zero entries lies on the
i-th sub-principle diagonal, i.e.:

then, Index M = i.

M

mn = cm δm+i,n, n, m ∈ N,
(cid:1)

(cid:0)

i ∈ Z,

(7.8)

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that all the cm 6= 0. The kernel of M is spanned by the projection on the ﬁrst i
dimensions. The kernel of M ∗ is empty. Consequently Index M = i. Now to the general case: Since
M is Fredholm there is at most a ﬁnite number of cm = 0. Deforming a ﬁnite number of cm to zero,
does not change the index by the stability under compact perturbations, and so Index M = i. (cid:3)

That the Hall conductance of each full Landau level is 1/2π is known from 1001 diﬀerent calculations
and arguments. The following computation, via an index, gives the 1002 way of seeing that:

Proposition (7.3). For the m-th Landau levels:
z
|z|

Index (Pm

Pm) = −1.

In particular, the charge transport and charge deﬁciency of each Landau level is unity.

Proof. From (7.6) one sees that the state < z|n, m > has angular momentum proportional to n − m.

Consequently, the matrix elements of

(cid:17)n,n′ are:

The result now follows from lemma 7.2. (cid:3)

(7.9)

(7.10)

As we have discussed in previous sections, the charge deﬁciency may be thought of as the change
of number of electrons in a cycle where a ﬂux tube carrying one unit of quantum ﬂux is introduced
into the system. In the present situation one can follow this cycle by the spectral analysis of the
Landau Hamiltonian with a ﬂux tube carrying any real ﬂux. One ﬁnds that as the ﬂux increases
by one unit, n states from the n-th Landau level descend to the n − 1 Landau level, and one state
is lost to inﬁnity [1,26].

8. The Ergodic Case

In this last section we extend the results of sections 4 and 6 about covariant families of projectors to
the case of an ergodic family of Schr¨odinger operators, H(A, Vω): ω is a point in probability space
˜Ω, the action of translations on ˜Ω is ergodic and:

We shall denote integrals with respect to the probability measure by < · >. This family of
Schr¨odinger operators is one of the canonical models for the integer Hall eﬀect.

Vω(x + a) = VTaω(x)

(8.1)

Proposition (8.1). Let Pω be a spectral projection for H(A, Vω) satisfying hypothesis 3.1, ω ∈ Ω.
Then Index (PωU Pω) is measurable with values in Z. In fact Index (PωU Pω) is integer and constant
almost everywhere .

Proof. We prove ﬁrst that Index (PωU Pω) is measurable. Due to proposition 2.2 and 2.4 the index
can be expressed in terms of a trace

Index (PωU Pω) = T r (Pω − Qω)2n+1,

Qω ≡ UωPωU −1
ω .

(8.2)

18

(8.3)

(8.4)

(8.5)

(8.6)

(8.6)

(8.8)

Hence it is enough to prove measurability of the operator as an operator valued function of ω,
i.e. measurability of the scalar product (f, (Pω − Qω)2n+1f ), f ∈ L2(R2). But the resolvent and
therefore the projector Qω, which by assumption can be expressed in terms of an integral over the
resolvent, is measurable. This proves the assertion.
Secondly. the function I(ω) ≡ Index (PωU Pω) takes integer values. Hence ˜Ω = I −1(Z). Further-
more for every k ∈ (Z), I −1(k) is an invariant set in ˜Ω under the action of translations. This is seen
as follows: Let Za denote again the magnetic translation. Since

So the index is constant on the orbits of translations. Due to ergodicity, the measure of I −1(k), is
zero or one for all k ∈ Z, . Since

(Za Vω Z −1

a )(x) = Vω(x − a) = VTaω(x),

we have:

Since the index is shift invariant (Proposition (3.8)) we have:

Za Pω Z −1

a = PTaω

Index (Pω U Pω) = Index (PTaω U PTaω).

µ( ˜Ω) = 1 =

µ

I −1(k)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

Xk∈Z

it follows that there is just one k0 ∈ Z for which µ

I −1(k0)
(cid:1)
(cid:0)

= 1. (cid:3)

In the ergodic situation the analog of (4.1) is:

Pω(x, y) = Ua(x)PTa ω(x − a, y − a)U −1

a (y)

This means that the analog of (4.2) is: The triple product that enters the basic formula, 3.7,

< Pω(x1, x2)Pω(x2, x3)Pω(x3, x1) >,

is translation invariant i.e. it does not change under the substitution xi → xi + a, ω → Taω, a ∈ R2.

We see that we get an analog of Theorem (4.1) at the price of averaging over probability space.
Namely,

Theorem (8.2). Let H(A, Vω) be a family of ergodic Schr¨odinger operators and U a unitary oper-
ator with unit winding number satisfying hypothesis 3.1 for all ω ∈ Ω, in particular pω(x, y) satisﬁes
inequality 3.1. Then the average Hall charge transport < Q > satisﬁes, a.e.:

< Q >= −Index (PωU Pω)

(8.9)

Proof. The proof of this statement is an adaptation of the one given in section 4, theorem 4.2;
integrating the basic equality 3.7 for the index over probability space brings us into the situation we
had encountered in the proof of theorem 4.2 since the average of the triple product (8.8) is invariant
under translations. (cid:3)

Appendix A

The purpose of this appendix is to show that hypothesis 3.1 on the regularity and decay of the
integral kernel of spectral projections is guaranteed whenever the Fermi energy is placed in a gap.
Although we have not attempted to give optimal conditions on the vector potentials, the conditions
are mild enough to cover the physically interesting models.

Theorem (A.1). Let H(A, V ) be a one particle Schr¨odinger operator in n = 2, 3 dimensions with
diﬀerentiable vector potential A and scalar potential V which is in the Kato class Kn=2,3 (which
includes Coulombic singularities).
a) The integral kernel for spectral projections for H(A, V ), p(x, y) is jointly continuous in x and y.
b) Suppose, in addition, that H(A, V ) has a gap in the spectrum. Then the spectral projection below
the gap has integral kernel which decays exponentially with |x − y|.

Remark. The two parts of the theorem have rather diﬀerent proofs. The Kn condition is natural
for (a). Part (b) only requires form boundedness of V which is slightly weaker than the Kn condition.

Proof. (a) exp(−tH)(x, y) has a jointly continuous integral kernel by the path integral (Ito) way of
writing the kernel – see, e.g. [37]. Because H is bounded below and has a gap, P = g(H) where
g is a smooth function of compact support. Since f (y) ≡ exp(2y)g(y) can be approximated by
polynomials exp(−y) uniformly, we can write

g(H) = lim gj(H),

gj(H) ≡ exp(−H)fj(H) exp(−H),

(A.1)

where the operators fj converge to f in norm as L2 → L2 operators and each fj(H) is a polynomial
in exp(−H). On general principles (see, e.g. [37]), exp(−H) is a bounded operator from L1 to L2
and from L2 to L∞. Thus the limit in (A.1) gives a bounded operator from L1 to L∞ and so in
inﬁnity norm for the integral kernel (see e.g.
[37]). Since gj has a continuous integral kernel the
result follows.
(b) Let B~a ≡ ei ~a·~x, a ∈ C, be a complex boost. Then:

Ba H(A, V ) B−a = H(A, V ) + ~a · ~a + ~a · (−i ~∇ − ~A).

(A.2)

This gives an analytic family of type B in the sense of Kato [21] if the form domain is independent
of ~a. In particular, this is the case if V is form bounded relative to the kinetic energy. By the
diamagnetic inequality it is enough to check that V is bounded relative to the Laplacian. Kn
implies form boundedness (see [37] ). In particular, if P is a spectral projection associated with a
gap, then the gap is stable and:

pa(x, y) = ei a·xp(x, y)e−i a·y

(A.3)

is real analytic in ~a uniformly in x and y. In particular, (A.2) says that p(x, y) is exponentially
decaying in |x − y|. This is a version of the Combes–Thomas argument [10]. (cid:3)

Remarks. 1. For potentials V which are perturbations of Landau Hamiltonian, an adaptation of
the above method gives decay which is faster than any exponential.
2. It is easy to construct families of Schr¨odinger operators, with ergodic A and V so that H(A, V )
has gaps in the spectrum.
3. A central open question is wether the integral kernel of spectral projections for ergodic Schr¨odinger
operators in two dimensions automatically satisfy the decay assumption of hypothesis 3.1 for most
Fermi energies.

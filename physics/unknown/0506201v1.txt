A classic problem of the motion of a point mass (projectile) thrown at an angle 
to the horizon is reviewed. The air drag force is taken into account with the drag factor 
assumed to be constant. Analytic approach is used for investigation. The  problem   of  
finding  an  optimal angle  of  launching  a point mass in a medium with quadratic drag 
force is considered. An equation for determining a value of this angle is obtained. After 
finding the optimal angle of launching, eight main parameters of the point mass motion 
are  analytically  determined.  These  parameters  are  used  to  construct  analytically  six 
main functional relationships of the problem. Simple analytic formulas are used to solve 
two  problems of optimization aimed to maximize the flight range of a point mass and 
minimize   the   initial   speed  of  the point  mass  for getting    to the given point  on  the 
plane. The motion of a baseball is presented as an example. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 

The problem of the motion of a point mass under a drag force is considered in 
innumerable  works [1 - 17]. Most  of them  solve  the problem  numerically. Analytical 
approaches    to  the  solution  of  the  problem  are  insufficiently  developed.  Meanwhile, 
analytical solutions are compact and convenient for a direct use in applied problems and 
for a qualitative analysis. Comparatively simple approximate analytic formulas to study 
point  motion  with  quadratic  drag  force  were  obtained  within  the  framework  of  this 
approach  in  [11  -  13].  One  of  the  most  important  aspects  of  the  problem  is  the 
determination of the optimal angle of throwing which provides the maximum range of 
throw    [14],  [15].  This  paper  shows  how  the  formulas    [11  -  13]  are  used  to  find  the 
optimal  angle  of  throwing  and  other  kinematical  parameters    of  the  motion.  These 
formulas are used for solution of  two problems of optimization too. The first problem is 
solved to find an optimum angle of throwing of a point mass to get the maximum range 
in case when the point of incidence is above or below the point of throwing. The second

problem is solved to find the optimum angle of throwing which ensures minimal initial 
velocity  of  the point  mass  for  getting  to  the  given  point on  the  plane.  Simple  analytic 
formulas  were  obtained  for  solution  of  the  both  problems.  These  formulas  make  it 
possible to carry out a complete qualitative analysis without using numeric integration 
of point mass motion differential equations. The problems are  solved  by  graphing  the  
appropriate  function.  The  given  examples  make  a  comparison  between  analytically 
obtained characteristics of motion and those calculated numerically. Numeric values of 
parameters are obtained by integration of point motion equations by the standard fourth-
order Runge-Kutta method. 

2.  Equations  of  Motion,  Local  Solution  and  Analytical  Formulas  for  the  Main 
Parameters 
 

The problem of the motion of a point mass under a drag force  with a number of 
conventional assumptions, in the case of the drag force proportional to the square of the 
velocity, R = mgk 2V  ,  boils down to the solution of the differential system [2]:    

           

 
Here  V  is  the  speed  of  the  point,  m  is  the  mass  of  the  point,    θ  is  the  trajectory  slope 
angle  to  the  horizontal,    g  is  the  acceleration  due  to  gravity,    x,  y    are  the  Cartesian 

coordinates of the point, 

k

=

=

const   is the proportionality factor,  aρ  is the air 

Scρ
da

mg

density,  dc  is the drag factor for a sphere, and  S  is the cross-section area of the object.  
The  well-known  solution    of  Eqs.  (1)  consists  of  an  explicit  analytical 
dependence of the velocity on the slope angle  of the trajectory and three quadratures [2]

The  integrals  on  the  right-hand  sides  of    (3)  are  not  taken  in  finite  form.  Hence,  to 
determine the variables   t , x and  y  we must either integrate (1) numerically or evaluate 
the definite integrals (3). 

Using  the  integration  of   quadratures  (3)  by  parts  for  enough small interval

The  function  V(θ)  in  (4)  is  defined  by  relation  (2). These  formulas  have a  local  form. 
Equations    (4)    enable  us  to  obtain  comparatively  simple  approximate  analytical 
formulas  for  the  main  parameters  of  motion  of  the  point  mass  [12].    We  will  give  a

6. Conclusion 
 

The proposed approach based on the use of analytic formulas makes it possible 
to  significantly  simplify  a  qualitative  analysis  of  the  motion  of  a  point  mass  with  air 
drag  taken  into  account.  All  basic  parameters  of  motion,  functional  relationships  and 
various problems of optimization are described by simple analytic formulas. Moreover, 
numeric  values  of  the  sought  variables  are  determined  with  an  acceptable  accuracy. 
Thus,  set  formulas  [11  –  13]  and  (5)  –  (10)  make  it  possible  to  carry  out  complete 
analytic investigation of the motion of a point mass in a medium with drag the way it is 
done for the case of no drag.   As a whole, the collection of formulas (4)–(10) makes it 
possible  to  widen  considerably  the  possibilities  of  studying  the  problem  of  the  point 
mass  motion    with  quadratic  drag  force  and  to  supplement  numeric  methods  with  
analytic ones.

Abstract: Formation of a lightning within a cloud, between clouds and towards the earth is 
studied  as  an  application  of  sociophysics.  The  three  dimensional  society  is  sky  or  cloud, 
which  has  members  as  electrically  charged  clouds  (in  sky)  or  patches  (in  cloud).  Members 
interact  with  the  neighboring  ones  and  all  are convinced  to  average  their  charges  (opinion). 
Yet, big external drives (mass media) as winds and turbulences may load new charges or may 
force the present ones to accumulate temporally at a site. For a lightning towards the earth, 
similarly charged clouds in sky (patches carrying big charges in a cloud) are expected to come 
close to each other. In all, discharging process is nothing, but what is called lightning.  
 
Introduction:  From  the  time  of  Benjamin  Franklin  (1706-1790)  on,  many  scientific 
investigations  were  made  on  lightning.  In  this  contribution,  which  is  (up  to  our  knowledge) 
the  first  application  of  3-dimensional  opinion dynamics  and  to  meteorology,  we  represent  a 
cloud (sky) in our model by a cubic (I=NxNxN) matrix, where each entry (i) carries a time (t) 
dependent  charge  Qi(t).  ([1],  and  references  therein.]  We  may  have  macroscopic  neutrality 
and conservation of total charge; 
 

∑I

i Qi(t) = 0   .  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1)  

 

 

Vi(t)=Qi(t)/Ci(t)   , 

 
In fact this condition is optional and any cloud may carry a net charge (Qnet). 
   These  are  well  known,  that  the  corresponding  potential  (Vi)  of  each  site,  with  respect  to 
infinity is defined as; 
 
 
 
where Ci(t) is the local electrical capacity, and effect of other charged patches are ignored. We 
have the total potential (VT
 
 
 
where ri,j is the Euclidean distance between lattice points (i) and (j). 
   Vectoral  electric  field  (E)  and  current  density  (J)  between  the  close  entries  (i)  and  (j)  are 
given as 
 

i) at (i) (approximately) as; 

i(t)= Vi(t) + ∑I

i≠j Qi(t)/ri,j   ,

respectively. In Eq. (4), the gradient of V (∇VT(t)) is calculated at (i), and in Eq. (4) σ is the 
usual (local) conductivity. Moreover we have a magnetic field B(t)=∂E/∂t, which we ignore. 
   Under normal conditions, i.e., if the conductivity is sufficiently large, neighboring charges 
neutralize each other; Qi(t)→Qi(∞), and VT
i(t) → VT
i(∞) as t→ ∞. Whereas, if big turbulences 
exist, where the charged patches (clouds) move with respect to each other with high speeds, 
neutralizations  may  not  be  completed  at  a  given  time.  In  the  mean  time,  big  charge 
accumulations  may  take  place  occasionally,  so  that  the  magnitude  of  E(t)  (Eq.  (4))  may 
exceed  the  critical  value  (sparking  threshold)  of  the  cloud  (air),  and  lightning  may  occur 
within a cloud, between clouds and towards the earth. 
   Our model is given in the following section; applications and results are displayed in next 
one. Last section is devoted for discussion and conclusion. 
 
Model:  We  assume  uniform  and  constant  capacitance  and  conductivity  between  the  clouds 
and  within  a  cloud,  Eqns.  (2),  and  (5),  respectively,  and  take  each  as  unity;  Ci(t)=1, 
independently  of  time  and  the  sub  index,  and  σ(t)=1,  for  all  t.    Moreover  we  follow  a  first 
nearest neighbor (nn) approximation for connectivity with unit binding strength between each 
nn. 

Initiation: We charge each entry by random real numbers ±Qi(0), where -1≤Qi(0)≤1. Clearly, 
Eq. (1) is satisfied (within randomness) and unit for charge is irrelevant here. 

 

 

 

 

 

(6) 

Qi(t) = (Qi(t-1) + ∑j

nn Qj(t-1) )/(ρ+1)   , 

Evolution:  We  apply  the  usual  iterative  interaction  tours,  and  assume  that  only  nn  charges 
interact and average[2] with Qi; 
 
 
 
where ρ is the number of nn for (i), and ρ=6 if (i) is in bulk, ρ=5 if (i) is on the surface, ρ=4 if 
(i) is on the edge, and ρ=3 if (i) is at the corner of the cubic cloud. 
   For turbulences, we randomly exchange charges at sites, (Qi(t) ↔ Qj(t)), i.e. we shuffle the 
charges  at  each  tour;  and  then  let  mutual  interactions  take  place  between  the  nn’s  for 
averaging  in  terms  of  short-range  currents  (no  spark,  no  lightning)).  One  may  repeat  this 
process at each tour and observe  fluctuations in E(t) within the cloud (between the clouds). 
And whenever E(t) exceeds in magnitude the critical value (sparking threshold) of the cloud 
(Ecloud), lightning may occur between the sites (i) and (j) in a cloud. 
   For  a  lightning  towards  the  ground,  VT
i(t)/H  must  exceed  the  critical  value  (sparking 
threshold) of the air (Eair), where H is the height of the cloud and Eair is lower than the sunny 
day values due to the present wetness. 
 
Results: In Figure 1. a.-d. we display the averaging process of charges (opinions)[2] taking 
place  within  a  cloud  (society)  matrix,  where  the  matrix  is  charged  by  random  real  numbers 
±Qi(0) initially, as described within the previous section. Fig. 1. a. displays charge evolution 
of  (representative)  three  sites  (i),  (N=20).  Fig.  1.  b.  displays  Emax
nn(t)  and  QT(t),  for  N=20, 
where Emax
nn(t) is the maximum value in magnitude of the electric field between the nn sites, 
and QT(t) is the total charge (∑I
iQi(t)) within the matrix, both at a given time t. Please note 
that  QT(t)  is  crucial  since  it  involves  the  information  about  the  evolution  of  charges 
macroscopically, and Emax
nn(t) is crucial since it controls the ignition of lightning. Fig. 1. c. is 
the  histogram  for  initial  distribution  of  charges  (opinions)  within  the  cloud  (society),  with 
N=9. Fig. 1. d. is the charge distribution at the 200th tour (time, t) with N=9, (QT(t→∞)=Qnet). 

   We  represent  a  wind  (storm,  turbulence)  by  two  parameters;  (random)  duration  for 
averaging process (twait) between two consecutive shuffles ((Qi(t) ↔ Qj(t)), and by number of 
sites  interchanged  per  shuffle.  Clearly,  twait  is  a  measure  for  wind  speed  and  it  is  inversely 
proportional  to  speed.  The  number  of  charged  sites  interchanged  per  shuffle  represents 
turbulence due to wind, where turbulence may also be taken as proportional to wind speed. 
   Magnitude  of  the  electric  field  between  any  neighboring  sites  carrying  opposite  unit 
charges, may be calculated (Eqns. (3) and (4)) to be in arbitrary units. We may utilize some 
multiples of this value as a unit for spark thresholds. So; Ecloud =C, and Eair =A. 
   Figure  2.  a.-c.  (N=10)  displays  effect  of  wind  speed  and  turbulence  on  Emax
nn(t),  where 
Emax
nn(t) is the maximum value in magnitude of the electric field between the nn sites. Fig. 2. 
a.  is  Emax
nn(t)  with  twait≤1000,  i.e.,  at  the  end  of  a  time  period  of  twait  equals  to  1000  at 
maximum.  Wind  will  turbinate  the  cloud  randomly  by  0%  (thinnest  line),  20%,  and  50% 
(thickest line). Fig. 2. b. and Fig. 2. c. is as Fig. 2. a. with twait equals to 100 at maximum and 
twait equals to 10 at maximum, respectively. 
   We tried several more combinations of twait and number of interchanged sites per shuffle in 
many  runs  and  observed  that,  the  present  mechanism  has  a  small  probability  to  form  a 
lightning. Yet, it may ionize the matter at the interfaces of nn sites in terms of glowing and 
thus  charge  may  flow  easily  through  these  channels.  It  may  be  emphasized  that,  turbulence 
does not cause lightning to occur but it may be useful for it. 
   On the other hand, turbulence may bring similar charges side by side, and increase the local 
potential  temporarily.  It  may  also  suddenly  squeeze  the  volume  (volumei(t))  and  lessen  the 
local capacity (Ci, in Eq. (2)). It is well known, that the electrical capacity is proportional to 
its space dimension in terms of length, thickness, radius, etc. So, for a given Qi(t), VT
i(t) may 
abruptly increase during (adiabatic) pressure (Pi(t)) vortices: VT
i(t) ∝ (Ci(t) ∝ (volume i(t))-1/3 
∝) (Pi(t))1/3. Hence, if pressure increases by a factor of eight say (i.e. to P=8 atmosphere), then 
the local potential and the maximum of electric field in magnitude increase by a factor of two, 
and thus the threshold value C (A) may be exceeded, and we have a lightning. 
   In  Figure  3.  a.-b.  we  display  Emax
factor of eight at maximum, in all). 
   Whenever the pressure increment within a cloud occurs regionally, i.e. covering many sites, 
we  may  have  longer,  intra  clouds  lightning.  And  sometimes,  similar  charges  may  be 
accumulated  at  a  wider  region,  and  the  opposite  ones  may  be  distributed  within  the  cloud. 
Then,  averaging  process  and  sparking  between  neighboring  sites  cease,  which  may  cause  a 
lightning  to  occur  towards  the  ground.  In  this  case,  we  may  have  Eq.  (3)  with  A≤VT/H.  In 
Figure  4.  we  display  a  charge  distribution  where  we  have  regional  distributions  of  similar 
charges within a cloud or in the sky. 
 
Discussion and Conclusion: The present approach may be considered as qualitative, where 
many approximations are performed.  It is clear that, at any time t and for a volume charge 
density ρ(r), ∇2V(r)=ρ(r) must be solved and the effect of B(r,t) must be taken into account 
for more accurate results. Moreover the probability density functions for Q, V, and E might be 
utilized for more expressive figures, if the present computer facilities were suitable for it. We 
ignored  the  possible  smaller  lightings  which  might  have  occurred  at  earlier  times  than 
lightning occurred. 
   In  case  of  turbulence,  instead  of  shuffling,  new  charge  configurations  may  be  set  at  each 
tour.  And,  as  another  equivalent  way,  one  may  choose  some  sites  randomly  and  load  there 
new  random  charges  Q’i.  And,  it  is  clear  that,  big  clouds  are  likely  to  have  inter  cloud 
lightning  and  small  ones  are  that  to  have  intra  cloud  ones,  and  that  is  why  we  varied  our 
matrix size N. 
 

nn(t)  for  various  twait  (N=5,  and  pressure  increases  by  a 

   As  a  final  remark,  it  may  be  stated  that,  the  effect  of  storm,  which  increases  the  local 
potential in terms of pressure increment may be considered as a form of leader (media) effect 
in sociophysics. [3, and references therein.]

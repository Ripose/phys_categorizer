Abstract

The  cw  CCL  being  designed  for  the  Accelerator
Production of Tritium (APT) project accelerates protons
from 96MeV to 211MeV. It consists of 99 segments each
containing  up  to  seven  accelerating  cavities.  Segments
are  coupled  by  intersegment  coupling  cavities  and
grouped into supermodules. The design method needs to
address not only basic cavity sizing for a given coupling
and  pi/2  mode  frequency,  but  also  the  effects  of  high
power  densities  on  the  cavity  frequency,  mechanical
stresses,  and the structure’s stop band during operation.
On the APT project, 3-D RF (Ansoft Corp.’s HFSS) and
coupled  RF/structural  (Ansys  Inc.’s  ANSYS)  codes  are
being  used  to  develop  tools  to  address  the  above  issues
and guide cooling channel design. The code’s predictions
are  being  checked  against  available 
low  power
Aluminum models. Stop band behavior under power will
be  checked  once  the  tools  are  extended  to  CCDTL
structures  that  have  been  tested  at  high    power.  A
summary  of  calculations  made  to  date  and  agreement
with measured results will be presented.

1  INTRODUCTION

To design a CCL structure, the RF design codes need
to predict the pi/2 mode frequency (fpi/2) and nearest (k)
and next-nearest-neighbor coupling constant (kk) of the
CCL.  Calculation  accuracy  has  to  be  such  that  final
frequency  adjustment  of  fabricated  structures  can  be
accomplished  by  the  usual  methods  of  machining  of
reasonably  sized  tuning  features  (rings)  or  by  small
mechanical  deformation  of  thinned  portions  of  cavity
walls.  The  pi/2  mode  frequency 
is  arrived  at  by
calculating the frequency of the accelerating cavities (ac)
without  coupling  slots  and  correcting  this  frequency  by
frequency  shifts  caused  by  coupling  slots  and  next-
nearest-neighbor  coupling  [1].  To  obtain  as  high  an
accuracy as possible, the approach used in this work was
to calculate the no slot absolute frequencies in 2-D using
SUPERFISH and only calculate frequency  differences in
3-D using HFSS.

High  RF  power  operation  of  the  accelerator  causes
thermally induced stresses that can lead to:

•  Yielding  of  the  cavity  metal  components  leading

to permanent frequency shifts.

•  Excessive  frequency  shifts  of  the  accelerating

mode.

•  Different  frequency  shifts  for  the  coupling  and
accelerating  cavities  (i.e.  change  in  stop  band
width leading to lower field stability).

 To predict high power effects, a code like ANSYS that
couples 
structural
calculations  can  be  used  to  calculate  the  mechanical
distortions  and  stresses  caused  by  a  particular  cooling
channel  configuration  and  power  level.  The  frequencies
of  the  accelerating  and  coupling  modes  of  the  distorted
structure can then be calculated in two ways:

and 

•  By  recalculating  the  modes  of  the  distorted
the  deformed  geometry
thermal-

the  coupled 

structures  using 
(“morphed”  mesh), 
mechanical problem.

•  By calculating the frequency shifts caused by the
cavity  deformations  using  a  technique  such  as
the Slater [2] perturbation method.

Since  the  expected  frequency  shifts  are  small  (e.g.
100kHz  for  a  700MHz  cavity),  the  perturbation  method
could be expected to yield more accurate results than the
recalculation of the entire problem with a deformed and
re-meshed geometry.

This article reports on results of the HFSS and ANSYS

calculations performed to date.

2  RF CALCULATIONS_RESULTS

2.1 Calculation Procedure

The  dimensions  of  a  half  scale 

(~1,400MHz)
Aluminum model of  segment 243 of the APT CCL were
used for the calculations. The calculation procedure was:
•  Calculate  the  frequency  f0sf  of  the  accelerating

cavity using SUPERFISH [3].

•  Construct  an  HFSS  model  of  one  period  of  the
CCL segment consisting of ½ accelerating cavity
and two ¼ sections of coupling cavities.

•  Use  periodic  boundary  conditions  with  coupling
cavity field phase shifts of 00, 360, 720, 1080, 1440,
and  1800  to  calculate  the  mode  spectrum  of  the
structure with HFSS.

•  Fit  the  mode  spectrum  to  obtain  the  cavity
frequencies  (fhfss)  including  slots,  and  khfss  and
kkhfss.

•  Generate a model of ½ of the accelerating cavity
in  HFSS  using  the  same  segmentation  as  in  the
periodic  model  (to  guide  the  mesh  and  control
cavity  effective size ) and calculate its frequency
f0hfss.

Calculations  were  performed  for  several  cases  that
included  knife  edged  coupling  slots  with  different
coupling cavity depth (case 1 and case 2 below) and the
enlargement of coupling slots by chamfering (case 3 and
case  4  below).  Frequency  shifts  were  calculated  for  ac
cavities  only,  future  work    will  address  the  coupling
cavities.

For  comparison  with  the  calculations,  Aluminum
model no-slot ac frequencies and mode frequencies were
measured.  The  mode  spectra  of  the  cavity  model  (11
cavities)  were  fit  to  extract  the  ac  frequencies  and
coupling constants.

The  differences  between  the  calculated  and  measured
pi/2  mode  frequencies  are  well  within  the  correction
range (+/-3MHz) for a reasonably sized tuning ring. The
nearest-neighbor  coupling  constants  are  very  accurately
calculated and the accuracy of the next-nearest-neighbor
coupling calculation is also reasonable.

2  ANSYS CALCULATIONS

Post-processor  ANSYS  routines  implementing  the
Slater perturbation calculations in 3-D have been written.
To  test  the  implementation,  frequency  shifts  for  simple
geometry  cavities  were  calculated  and  checked  by
comparison 
fully  coupled
calculations. The calculated cases included:

theory  and 

the 

to 

to 

•  Copper  1GHz  pillbox  cavity  (TM010  mode),
to  a  uniform  –100F

shift  due 

frequency 
temperature change.

•  Copper  pillbox  cavity,  outside  surface  of  metal
held  at  constant  temperature,  inside  heated  by
radio frequency (RF) fields.

•  Copper CCL cavity with cooling channels heated

by RF fields.

In  addition,  work  is  proceeding  on  modelling  and
calculations of modes and frequency shifts for a periodic
APT CCL structure.
3.1Pillbox Cavity Results
The radius of a 1GHz pillbox is:

r=11.4742541cm

Using an expansion coefficient for copper of 10-5 /0F, a
temperature  gives  a  new

lowering  of

Where ro1 is the root of J0, c is the speed of light, and

dr is the change in radius.
So the frequency shift is:

dfcalc=100,011Hz

Using  the  same  radius  change  and  the  surface  fields
calculated  by  ANSYS,  the  Slater  perturbation  method
gives a frequency shift of:

dfslater=100,083Hz

The  corresponding  calculation  results  of  the  absolute
cavity frequency using ANSYS linear and quadratic basis
functions are:

flinear=1,001,028,656Hz

fquadratic=1,000,687,772Hz

The error in calculating the absolute frequency of the
pillbox is larger (~688kHz) than the frequency shifts of
interest in the design of accelerator cavities. This error is
due  to  mesh  size,  numerical  accuracy,  shape  function
order,  etc.  This  indicates  that  errors  can  be  expected  to
grow  as  the  geometry  of  the  cavity  becomes  more
complicated by coupling slots, noses, and other features
that increase the curvature of surfaces, distort the mesh,
etc.

Coupled calculations of a Copper pillbox were used to
calculate  the  frequency  shifts  of  a  thick  wall  cavity
heated  internally  by  RF  fields  while  the  outside  of  the
Copper  was  held  at  constant  temperature.  Two  cases
were calculated, one without including the effects of the
motion  of  the  cavity  circular  end  walls  and  the  other
including  these  effects.  The  motion  of  the  end  walls
should result in zero frequency shift and is thus a good
test  of  the  accuracy  of  calculation  of  electric  and
magnetic  contributions  to  the  frequency  shift  in  the
Slater method.

The results are compared to the Slater calculations and

theory below.

The  heating-caused  radius  change  calculated  by
ANSYS  was  4.8551*10-2cm.  This  gives  a  calculated
frequency shift of :

dfcalc=-4,213,469Hz

The  corresponding  results  of  the  coupled  and  Slater
calculations using quadratic shape functions for the end-
wall and no-end wall cases are listed in Table 2.

-4,213,469Hz

w/ end wall
-4,181,683Hz
-4,232,266Hz
-4,213,469Hz

The  0.06%  difference  in  the  Slater  end-wall/no-end-
wall results shows the degree of non-cancellation of the
electric and magnetic field contributions to the frequency
shifts on the end walls of the cavity. This error is quite
small and the Slater agreement with the calculated value
is  excellent  (0.4%).  The  larger  1.5%  difference  in  the
coupled  results  is  probably  due  to  the  morphing  of  the
mesh near the end-walls of the cavity.

3.2 CCL Cavity Results

Only  preliminary  calculations  were  made  for  the  axi-

symmetric CCL cavity with cooling channels.

For  a  uniform    -100F  change  in  the  temperature  of  a
Copper CCL Cavity the resultant frequency shift results
are:

dfcalc=71,299Hz

dfslater=73,100Hz

The above 2.5% difference is larger than expected and
needs to be investigated to make sure that displacements
are  calculated  correctly  in  areas  of  small  radii  of
curvature.

The  results  for  the  cavity  cooled  by  cooling  channels

are:

dfcoupled=-198,202Hz

dfslater=-202,368Hz

The above frequency shifts differ by only 2.1%. They

will be compared to 2-D calculations in the future.

2  CONCLUSIONS

The comparisons made above indicate that:

• 

3-D codes such as HFSS can be used to calculate
coupling constants of periodic CCL structures very
accurately.

•  Frequency  shifts  caused  by  coupling  slots  can  be
calculated  by 3-D codes and used to predict pi/2
mode  frequencies  with  sufficient  accuracy  to  be
useful for design.

If  further  comparisons  between  calculations  and
experiment  are  as  successful  as  those  above,  3-D
accelerator structures can be designed with 3-D codes
without  the  construction  and  testing  of  numerous
Aluminum models.

frequency  shifts 

The preliminary work above also indicates that a 3-
D  Slater  perturbation  method  can  be  used  to  predict
thermally  caused 
in  accelerator
structures while avoiding possible problems associated
with mesh morphing in the ANSYS code. This method
also shortens calculation times since a recalculation of
the  resonant  mode  frequencies  is  not  necessary  after
the thermal/mechanical calculations are completed.

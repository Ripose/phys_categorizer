Abstract.  Scaling  analysis  of  seismicity  in  the  space-time-magnitude  domain  very  often
c
starts from the relation 
 for the rate of seismic events of magnitude
L
M > m in an area of size L. There are some evidences in favor of multifractal property of
seismic process. In this case the choice of the scale exponent ‘c’ is not unique. It is shown
how different ‘c’'s are related to different types of spatial averaging applied to  l (m, L)
and what are the ‘c’'s for which the distributions of aL best agree for small  L. Theoretical
analysis  is  supplemented  with  an  analysis  of  California  data  for  which  the  above  issues
were recently discussed on an empirical level.    

1. Introduction
The rate of seismic events of magnitude M > m occurring in a cell of size L· L denoted

l (m, L) is a priori scaled as follows:
bm L
c
(l

= 10

Lm

)

.

The  magnitude-dependent  exponential  factor  stems  from  the  Gutenberg-Richter  relation,
while  the  power  law  factor,  which  is  a  function  of  area  size,  expresses  the  fractality  of
epicenters for a noninteger ‘c’. Relation (1) is given the meaning of a seismicity law in [1, 2]
and a method is proposed for estimating its parameters (a, b, c). Viewed as such, relation (1)
needs specification, since a law must characterize a mean or “typical” earthquake-generating
area in a region of interest. Below we show that different specifications may lead to different
values of ‘c’.

Our analysis of (1) was occasioned by the circumstance that the estimation procedure
proposed  for  ‘c’ in [1, 2] leads to a correlation dimension  d2, while the motivation of scaling
(1) is based on the capacity (box) dimension d0. A similar difficulty with the choice of ‘c’ was
encountered when scaling the time interval between two consecutive events in California: Bak
et al. [3] used the estimate c = d2, while subsequent works dealing with the topic made use of
c = d0  (see  Corral  [4]).  It  has  turned  out  that  the  estimates  d0  and  d2  are  not  identical.  For
instance, the same California catalog gave d2 = 1.2 [2, 5] and d0 = 1.6 [4].

The  dimensions  d0  and  d2  belong  to  the  one-parameter  family  of  the  so-called
Grassberger-Procaccia dimensions [6],  dp  .  These  dimensions  are  strictly  decreasing,  if  the
measure of the rate of  M > m events denoted 
, i.e., the mean number of events per
unit time in an area dg, is a multifractal. Since the above estimates  d0 and d2  are  not  identical,
we will consider relation (1) in terms of a multifractal hypothesis for the measure

  and  for  histogram  of  these  quantities.  The

 over all cells with some weights. The choice of weights depends on the purpose for

Consider  the  population  of  normalized

the  subdivision  of  region  G  into  L· L  cells.  The  distribution  of  these  quantities  provides
another statistical description of  M > m seismicity rate in an  L· L area in  G.  Corral  [4]  found
Lx   for  California  is  virtually  independent  of  the  parameter  L  in  the
that the distribution of 
range 10–120 km for  m = 2 and 3. The  b-value  in  the  Gutenberg-Richter  relation  was  taken
0.95, while the scale exponent c = d0 = 1.6. It is also asserted in [4] that the distribution of 
Lx
is  only  weakly  dependent  on  the  choice  of  the  time  interval  D T  in  the  range  of  1  day  to  9
years.  The  statement  about  D T  calls  for  some  specification  in  order  to  be  reproducible.

3. California Seismicity
We used the  catalog  of  m ‡

  2  California  events  for  the  period  1984-2003  [8]  in  the
rectangle G = (30(cid:176) N, 40(cid:176) N) ·
 (113(cid:176) W, 123(cid:176) W). Estimation of the ‘b’-value  in  the  Gutenberg-
Richter  relation  does  not  cause  any  difficulties,  and  we  adopted  b = 0.95  for  G.  The
estimation of  d0  is  unstable,  so  the  estimation  procedure  is  described  below.  As  pointed  out
above,  the  fractal  dimension  1.2  is  used  for  ‘c’  in  [3]  for  scaling  of  interoccurrence  time
between earthquakes, while  c = d0 =  1.6  is  assumed  in  the  sequel  [4]  without  indicating  the
estimation method.

The box dimension d0  is  given  by  (2).  The  principal  difficulty  in  estimation  of  d0  for
point sets consists in their finiteness. The number of cells is increasing like  L-2 as L ﬁ
 0. For
this reason the number of cells  n(L)  that  cover  our  set  rapidly  saturates,  providing  the  false
(even though formally correct) estimate d0 = 0. The epicenters of seismic events are special in
the  sense  that  they  make  a  random  set.  Owing  to  purely  statistical  factors,  some  of  the

Leaving  aside  for  the  moment  the  stochastic  nature  of  epicenters,  requirement  (14)
means that the desired estimate of  d0  should  be  little  sensitive  to  cells  with  low  numbers  of

4. Scaling and magnitude: discussion

In our analysis the cutoff magnitude  m is fixed, so that the question as to the relation
Lx  with  m  was  not  discussed.  In  this
between the scale exponent ‘c’ and the distribution of 
connection  we  wish  to  point  out  the  following.  Great  earthquakes  usually  occur  at
intersections  of  lineaments  of  the  highest  rank  [10],  large  ones  on  lineaments  themselves,
while smaller events are diffused over the entire seismogenic region concerned. In this respect
one notes Fig. 6 showing larger Italian earthquakes. In  contrast to  the standard situation then
fractal analysis is based on catalogs of small events for a short period of time, Figure 6 shows
largest  events  from  the  catalogue  [3]  for  a  nearly  1000 - year  period,  1000  to  1980.
Earthquake  size  is  characterized  (because  of  natural  reasons)  in  terms  of  macroseismic
intensity I: I > 7 (a), I > 8 (b), and I > 9 (c).  Figure  6  clearly  shows  differences  in  seismicity
generators:  the  largest  events  concentrate  along  a  narrow  belt  (McKenzi  boundary)  of  width
30-50  km,  while  smaller  events  make  the  boundary  more  diffuse,  thus  inflating  d0.  It  may
therefore  be  conjectured  that  we  have  here  a  mixture  of  monofractals  corresponding  to
different sets of magnitude, while the measure 
  is  function  of  m. The circumstance
is  commonly  disregarded,  so  that  relations  like  (1)  are  extrapolations  from  small  m  to  high
magnitudes.

5. Conclusion

(

,
Lml

We  have  ascribed  a  definite  meaning  to  relation  (1)  which  is  frequently  used  in
seismicity studies, namely, for unification of distributions of different statistics depending on
scale  and  magnitude  [3],  in  earthquake  prediction  [10,  11],  and  in  aftershock  identification
[12]. When the seismicity field is multifractal, the choice of ‘c’  in  (1)  is  nonunique  which  is
related  to  different  interpretations  of 
  as  the  rate  of  M > m  seismic  events  in  a
)
“random”  L· L  cell  of  the  region  of  study.  We  have  shown  using  the  California  data  with
m = 2, 3 that the scale exponent ‘c’  may  vary  in  the  range  1- 2. In particular,  c = 1.8- 2.0  is
 in  L· L cells.
suitable for scaling of both the ordinary mean and the distribution of 
(The value c = 1.6 is used in recent studies of California seismicity [2, 4, 11, 12].) But we can
 in L· L cells. This practice
solve these scaling problems using weights proportional to 
is  typical  for  statistical  evaluation  of  performance  of  earthquake  prediction  algorithms
  and

(
(see [10]).  Then  one  has  c =  1.1–1.2  for  the  scaling  of  the  weighted  mean

c = 1.4- 1.6  to  have  the  least  scatter  among  the  normalized  distributions

(

This  large  indeterminacy  in  the  choice  of  ‘c’  is  extremely  inconvenient  in  practice.
One way out consists in dealing with inferences that are weakly dependent on ‘c’  when  in  its
natural  range.  The  range  is  c = 1- 2  for  California.  One  supporting  remark  is  that  ‘c’  may
depend  on  the  magnitude  range.  Examples  show  that  the  dimension  of  large  earthquakes  is
close to 1, while that of small ones is close to 2. Lastly, in scaling analysis of seismicity the
magnitude m and the scale L are not independent, hence should be made to match.

Process  of  dynamical  tunneling  in  two-dimensional  coupled  potentials  is  considered  within 
Bohmian  approach  to  quantum  mechanics.  Quantum  trajectories  tend  to  go  along  the  paths  where 
potential  energy  increases  and  then  decreases.  It  leads  to  a  suggestion  that  dynamical  and  barrier 
tunneling are the same processes but the former is hidden due to specific potential surface.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Classical  study  for  the  vibrations  of  the  water 
molecule  by  Lawton  and  Child  has  revealed  an 
existence of local modes [1]. Classical trajectories may 
appear  nonsymmetric  even  in  symmetric  potential, 
reflecting the local structure of vibrations. The locality 
means  that  the  eigenstates  are  supposed  to  be  split. 
Later 
it  quantum 
mechanically  and  found  that  the  eigenstates  appear  to 
be  doublets  and  their  splitting  decreases  with  the 
increase  of  vibrational  quantum  number  [2].  The 
superposition  of  low  doublet  splitting  states  create 
localized ones in bond directions. These local states can 
make transitions between each other and the splitting is 
a  measure  of  the  energy  transfer  rate.  Such  transition 
between  local  states  is  classically  forbidden.  The 
system  behaves  like  being  under  the  influence  of  the 
double  well  potential  though  there  is  no  potential 
barrier. A similar result has been obtained by Davis and 
Heller in a study of quantum system in two-dimensional 
coupled  harmonic  potential  [3].  They  proposed  to  call 
that  process  dynamical 
the 
possibility  of  transition  of  quantum  system  between 
classically  trapped  regions  of  phase  space  in  the 
absence of potential barrier. Dynamical tunneling plays 
an important role in many processes [4,5] and cannot be 
ignored  in  the  semiclassical  method.  Moreover,  it  is 
harder  to  reveal  dynamical  tunneling  than  barrier 
tunneling  because  the  barrier  is  not  obvious  from  the 
potential surface. Instead, classical trajectories must be 
examined. 

tunneling  because  of 

From  semiclassical  point  of  view  the  barrier 
tunneling  in  double  well  potential  causes  the  energy 
splitting [6]. It was also noted in previous works about 
dynamical  tunneling.  In  current  work  we  try  to  clarify 
why  the  energy  splitting  is  available  in  the  absence  of 
barrier in dynamical tunneling process.  

As a matter of fact, it is not necessary for quantum 
system  to  go  along  the  path  where  potential  energy  is 
lower or equal to initial one, even if there is no potential 
restriction.  An  assumption  was  made  that  during 
dynamical  tunneling  the  probability  density  may  flow 

  
 

along  the  path  where  potential  energy  increases  and  then 
decreases.  Therefore  this  fact  can  be  treated  as  barrier 
tunneling.  

Only an analysis of wave function evolution as a whole is 
incapable  of  demonstration  of  barrier  tunneling  in  this  case. 
The  problem  should  be  solved  by  decomposition  of  initial 
density distribution into components and examination of their 
motion.  From  that  result  one  can  conclude  if  the  barrier 
tunneling  occurs.  The  approach  described  above  is  a  causal 
interpretation of quantum mechanics introduced by Bohm [7-
9].  

The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In 
Sec.II, we briefly present the basic idea of Bohmian approach 
for  two-dimensional  case.  Then  we  apply  it  for  dynamical 
tunneling  for  coupled  harmonic  (Sec.III)  and  water  (Sec.IV) 
potential. Finally, we summarize our findings in Sec.V. 

 
II. BOHMIAN APPROACH 
The Bohmian approach is an alternative interpretation of 
quantum mechanics. According to it a  wave propagation can 
be  represented  as  a  motion  of  ensemble  of  interacting  point 
particles.  Each  particle  obeys  the  law  of  motion  which  is 
derived from the Schroedinger equation and follows a definite 
track in space and time. Therefore this approach is also called 
causal  interpretation  of  quantum  mechanics.  A  motion  of  all 
particles  reveals  a  wave  function  evolution.  A  probability 
conception is not so important here as in usual interpretation 
but  it  can  still  be  defined  as  a  value  proportional  to  particle 
density in space. 

As  noted  above,  such  an  approach  is  useful  for  us 
because it explores the motion of a single component of wave 
function  and  then  one  can  extract  the  information  if  some 
pieces of wave packet tend to barrier tunneling. 

Mathematically,  the  main  idea  of  Bohmian  approach  is 
based on representation of wave function in a polar form (two 
dimensions) [7-9]

Equation  (2)  reminds  a  classical  Hamilton-Jacobi

is equivalent to the Schroedinger and does not provide 
any additional information yet.

If  the  initial  condition  for  a  particle  is  specified,  then 
integration  of  the  last  system  gives  the  trajectory  in 
space which a particle explores. 

Two  difficulties  may  arise  in  the  integration 
process. Firstly, if the time dependent wave function is 
unknown,  then  the  phase  S  has  to  be  derived  from  eq. 
(2)-(3).  In  general,  it  is  not  easy  to  perform  numerical 
integration due to quantum potential calculation. But if 

 is known, then S is derived as 
 

=S

arg(Y

)

 

   

(5) 
 
Secondly,  the  low  energy  splitting  means  that  initial 
local state evolves too long and numerical integration of 
(4) is not possible to carry out  for such long period of 
time, especially, if the trajectory encounters points near 
to nodes. 

To avoid the first problem, it is desirable to have definite 
time  dependent  wave  function.  Another  problem  can  be 
eliminated by performing integration only for relatively short 
time intervals. As a matter of fact, it is not necessary to have 
trajectory  for  the  whole  period  of  tunneling.  Knowledge  of 
potential change only  for short time along trajectory  may  be 
enough.  

In  the  next  two  sections  we  will  apply  the  described 
approach to systems for which dynamical tunneling has been 
detected.

where parameters used for calculation were  w
y=1.1, 
and  l =-0.11.  Diagonalization  of  the  potential  (6)  gives  pairs 
of  symmetric  and  antisymmetric  states  whose  splitting  tends 
to decrease if the energy increases. The sum and difference of 
split  states  create  symmetric  local  states.  One  of  those  pairs 
with vibrational quantum numbers v=15 and v=16 is shown in 
Fig.1.

These local states are not stationary and if one of them is left 
on  its  own,  it  evolves  in  time  and  finally  transforms  into  its 
symmetric state. Thus dynamical tunneling happens. The time 
evolution is described by a simple relation

during  the  next  half-period  of  tunneling.  Such  type  of 
trajectory is not unique. Some trajectories make a closed line 
and circulate few times for half-period of tunneling. They are 
depicted in Fig.4.  

At  this  stage  we  can  apply  the  Bohmian  approach 
for  a  study  of  dynamical  tunneling  of  this  system. 
Having the time dependent wave function (7), its phase 
is  recovered  according  to  (5) and  specifying  the  initial 
condition  out  of  node,  the  numerical  integration  of 
system  (4)  can  be  carried  out.  Fortunately,  at  our 
chosen  parameters  the  tunneling  period  is  t =103.58 
and  that  allows  us  to  integrate  the  system  (4)  through 
the  whole  period.  Using  forth-order  Runge-Kutta 
method for integration of (4), quantum trajectories were 
obtain. Some of them are depicted in Fig.2.

initial points: 1) x=2, y=2; 2) x=1, y=1; 3) x=0.5, y=0.5 

 
The  most  important  thing  is  that  it  is  clearly  seen  now 
that  trajectory  increases  its  potential  energy  after  launching 
(see  Fig.3).  Thus  we  proved  our  initial  supposition  about 
barrier tunneling in process of dynamical tunneling in coupled 
systems. 
 
 

IV.  WATER POTENTIAL 
In  a  study  of  vibrational  states  of  the  water  molecule  in 
the  ground  electronic  state,  where  dynamical  tunneling  has 
been  discovered,  Lawton  and  Child  employed  the  most 
realistic potential proposed by Sorbie and Murrel [10]. Many 
authors  used  another  type  of  potential  due  to  its  simple 
analytical  form  but  it  is  still  able  to  reproduce  a  good 
agreement with experimental data up to five quanta of stretch 
excitation. For a fixed bond angle this potential is given [11]

fixed  bond  angle.  The  eigenstates  for  the  Hamiltonian 
(10)  come  in  pairs  as  for  previous  case  of  coupled 
harmonic  potential.  The  superposition  of  one  of  the 
pairs is shown in Fig.5.

It  is  harder  to  perform  a  trajectory  calculation  for 
this system than for coupled harmonic potential due to 
low  energy  splitting  even  for  the  lowest  vibrational 
states. Consequently, the period of tunneling (8) is very 
high.  So  the  system  (4)  can  be  integrated  only  for  a 
short time. 

Employing  the  similar  calculation  procedure,  we 
obtained  quantum  trajectories  presented  in  Fig.6.  So 
one can conclude that the barrier tunneling is typical for 
this kind of potential, too. 

Nevertheless,  at  some  initial  condition  trajectory  can 
follow the path where potential does not increase. At least, it 
is  rightly  within  allowable  integration  time.  Anyway,  an 
existence  of  small  portion  of  barrier  tunneling  trajectories 
means that energy splitting is due to this effect in dynamical 
tunneling process. 

 

V. SUMMARY 
Tunneling  had  been  associated  for  a  long  time  with  a 
barrier penetration. It was reconsidered since the discovery of 
dynamical tunneling. Heller proposed to define the tunneling 
as  processes  which  take  place  in  a  quantum  world  but  are 
forbidden  in  classical  domain  regardless  of  potential  barrier 
availability.  

In  two-dimensional  coupled  potentials  considered  in 
current  work,  classical  system  can  be  localized  in  some 
spaces.  Its  dynamics  prohibits  it  from  making  transition  to 
other  places  though  there  is  no  energy  restriction.  Quantum 
system  can  make  such  a  transition.  As  we  have  shown,  it  is 
not  due  to  its  motion  along  the  energy  valley  on  the  energy 
surface.  Instead,  the  system  passes  through  the  regions  with 
higher  potential  energy.  In  other  words,  barrier  penetration 
occurs  during  dynamical  tunneling.  It  can  explain  specific 
energy splitting for these systems.

DYNAMICS OF CHEMICAL REACTIONS: 

OPEN EQUILIBRIUM 

Do we need coefficients of thermodynamic activity? 

ABSTRACT. 
 
Dynamic  properties  of  chemical  reactions  and  appropriate  relationships  for  open 
chemical equilibrium are discussed in approach of the chemical dynamics. New way 
to  calculate  composition  of  chemical  systems  in  open  equilibrium,  based  on  the 
amended  equation  for  the  change  of  Gibbs(cid:146)  free  energy,  was  exemplified  using 
reactions  of  cobalt  double  oxides  with  sulfur.  Evaluated  this  way  equilibrium 
reaction  extents  had  a  good  match  with  values  found  by  direct  thermodynamic 
simulation.  The  developed  method  allows  us  to  perform  analysis  of  complex 
chemical systems without coefficients of thermodynamic activity. In cases when the 
coefficients are in need or just desirable, the method offers a simple way to calculate 
them. Possible systems to apply method of chemical dynamics are discussed. 
 
Previous  paper  [1]  has  described  new  approach  to  the  thermodynamics  of  open 
chemical systems. With assigned generic name (cid:147)chemical dynamics(cid:148), that approach 
is  based  on  assumption  that  there  is  a  linear  relationship  between  external 
thermodynamic force and relevant shift of chemical reaction extent in the vicinity of 
(cid:147)true(cid:148) equilibrium. Corresponding expression for reduced Gibbs(cid:146) free energy change 
may be written as 
 

               ∆gi = ∆g0

i + fie*∆i+ lnΠaki(∆i, ηki)+ τi∆iδi,                                            (1) 

the  run  of 

 
where ∆i  - symbol for reaction extent ∆ξ, in (cid:147)true(cid:148) equilibrium ∆i = 1; δi − symbol 
for δξ = (1−∆) - reaction  shift  from  equilibrium;  ∆gi  =∆Gi/RT  (cid:150)  reduced  change of 
the  reaction  Gibbs(cid:146)  free  energy;  fie*∆i  (cid:150)  reduced  (divided  by  RT)  external 
thermodynamic force multiplied by ∆ thus having dimension of energy; aki(∆i, ηki) - 
thermodynamic  activity; ηki − amount  of  moles  of  k-participant  of  i-reaction, 
consumed/arrived 
this  reaction  from  initial  state  to  (cid:147)true(cid:148) 
thermodynamic equilibrium; and τ is a parameter of the theory characterizing system 
interaction  with  its  environment.  We  have  introduced  the  τi∆iδi  product  in  [1]  as 
(cid:147)chaotic(cid:148) member due to analogy with the well known chaotic equation [2].  
Taking into account that ∆g0
i = lnΠ‘i, tick mark and asterisk relate 
values to isolated (ISEQ) and open equilibrium (OPEQ) correspondingly, equation 
(1) will turn  to  
 

i = -lnKi, or ∆g0

 ∆gi = fie*∆i (cid:150) ln(Π‘i/Π*i) + τi∆iδI.                                              (2) 
 
One of the most important results described in [1] was a specific Hooke(cid:146)s law type of 
shift-force dependency, which is linear up to a certain value of the force, and then 

in

shows a kind of saturation. In many cases the curve is still linear (more correctly, 
quasi-linear) beyond the bend point but under different slope.  
In  the  run  of  this  work  about  a  hundred  of  reactions  with  essential  negative  ∆G0 
values were investigated, and in no cases deviations from the chemical Hookes law 
were  found.  Typical  distribution  of  reaction  coordinates  in  open  equilibrium  vs. 
thermodynamic forces for a large group of reactions (Me1O+S) at 298K in systems, 
where primary oxide is bound into double oxide Me1O*Me2O (MeO*R), is shown on 
Fig.1. Related source data is in the Table1. Zero thermodynamic force corresponds to 
conditional interaction of an oxide with itself thus representing isolated system, and

Physical nature of the parameter τ wasn(cid:146)t clear at the time when [1] was published. 
Further  investigation  has  unambiguously  showed  that  this  parameter  has  a  unique 
value  for  every  chemical  reaction  given  the  stoichiometric  equation  and  reactant  
amounts, and is responsible for reaction resistance against external thermodynamic 
force. It makes very clear why combination of τ and external thermodynamic force 
defines the reaction shift from (cid:147)true(cid:148) equilibrium.  
Each  chemical  reaction  can  be  characterized  by  several  dynamic  curves.  They  are 
already familiar force-shift curve and two others - reaction extent vs. effective Gibbs(cid:146) 
free energy change, calculated as a sum of internal and external values, and reaction 
extent vs. (cid:147)chaotic(cid:148) member τi∆iδi. Shift-force curve that can be used to determine τ 
for the simplest reaction A+B=AB is shown on Fig.2. Next picture, Fig.3 shows a 
joint graph of above mentioned curves. An arbitrary value of 0.5 was assumed for 
ηA, thus unilaterally defining ∆g0 for that reaction. Data used for plotting the graphs 
are in the Table 2.

Now we will give one practical example. Consider reaction between cobalt double

It was plotted with data calculated for the force as (-ln γCoO)/∆ and (-ln(Π‘/Π(∆))/∆. 
The  match  between  both  on  Fig.4  is  remarkable.  Values  of  the  parameter  τ  for 
0=<δ=>0.40 found from the graph in the first case was 32.61, in the second 41.27. 
Joint graph for this reaction with data based on τ = 41.27 is plotted on Fig.4. Points 
of  intersection  of  ascending  curves  with  the  descending  curve,  corresponding  to 
appropriate open equilibria, are shown on an enlarged part of Fig.6. Comparison of

evaluation in a system, taken arbitrarily out of the model set, the match is good and 
proves ability of the method of chemical dynamics to simulate open equilibria and 
complex chemical systems correctly. Better match for the values found purely by our 
method is a pleasant but yet not sufficient for far going conclusions and excessive 
optimism fact. So far we are investigating the method in general. 
Results  of  this  work  show  a  possibility  to  find  equilibrium  composition  of  a 
subsystem without simulation the complex chemical system as a whole. We can do it 
if  we  know  how  to  write  down  external  thermodynamic  force,  through  which  the 
(cid:147)complimentary(cid:148)  part  of  the  system  is  acting  against  the  subsystem.  Along  with 
results of [1] they prove that with the method of chemical dynamics one can avoid 
usage of thermodynamic activity coefficients at all. Nevertheless, in cases when the 
coefficients are still in need or just more habitual, the method of chemical dynamics 
provides  quite  simple  way  to  find  them  using  shift-force  relationship.  This 
relationship  has  been  found  to  be  unilateral  within  the  entire  possible  scope  of 
reaction shifts (from 0 up to almost 1) thus expanding the opportunities out of linear 
(more exactly, quasi-linear) area. 
In many cases this can eliminate expensive experimental works to define coefficients 
of thermodynamic activity. 
Double  oxides  with  strong  bounds  between  components,  used  in  this  work  as  a 
model set, represent only one example out of a big number of possible applications. 
Next  and  probably  more  practically  interesting  is  application  to  the  systems  with 
reactions  having  comparable  energetic  characteristics  (supposed  next  step  of  this 
work). Besides that, one interesting application of the method of chemical dynamics 
might also occur in stationary systems. In this case, using Onzager(cid:146)s relation between 
flows and thermodynamic forces, one can find equivalent value of external force to 
consider the stationary state formally related to the open equilibrium with chemical 
reaction shifted by this force. Most probably, this statement can be easily checked out 
in  electrochemical  systems,  where  electrochemical  forces  are  definitely  external to 
chemical reactions in the electrochemical cell, and relationships between them and 
flows (that is, electrical currents) are well known. 
To  conclude,  it  is  worthy  to  mention  that  ideology  of  here  developed  method  is 
totally  different  from  classical  way  of  analysis  of  complex  systems.  Conventional 
method aggregates all parts of the system to analyze the whole on a probability basis. 
We  go  opposite  direction,  dividing  the  system  by  parts  and  replacing  probability 
treatment of subsystems interaction by shift-force relationships. Difference between 
two  approaches  was  in  general  well  discussed  in  [3].  Developed  in  this  work 
approach descends back to d(cid:146)Alembert principle of classical mechanics [4, 5].

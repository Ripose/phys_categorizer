ABSTRACT 

 
The resonant configurations and normal frequencies of a loaded hanging chain 

that is rotating uniformly about the vertical are examined from theoretical and 
experimental perspectives. The chain is assumed pinned at both ends, with an extra load 
added to the lower end for stability. The equation of motion for this system is solved and 
it is shown that the various resonant configurations of the chain are described by Bessel 
functions of order zero. The normal frequencies are obtained and the predictions of the 
model are compared to experiment. Time-exposure photographs are presented to 
illustrate the shape of the various normal modes.

Introduction 

I. 
 
The dynamical behavior of a massive, vertically hanging chain or cable with a 

free lower extremity has been studied extensively over the years, in this journal and 
elsewhere. For example, the early texts of Routh1 and Lamb2 discuss the transverse 
modes of such a system with respect to oscillations that take place in a fixed vertical 
plane. More recently, in this journal, Bailey3 discussed the time required by a short 
transverse pulse to propagate up and down the chain. In other independent studies, 
Satterly,4 Levinson,5 Morse,6 Coomer et al.7 and McCreesh et al.8 also considered various 
aspects of the transverse modes, normal frequencies and swaying of a chain of discrete-
links or of a heavy cable. Young9 considered the longitudinal standing waves on a 
vertical slinky with a free lower extremity. Other workers studied the effects of rotation 
around a vertical axis on the stationary configurations that a heavy chain or cable can 
take, again when the lower extremity is free. Western10 considered a chain with free 
lower extremity; he determined its normal frequencies, compared the results to a few 
experimentally measured modes and also produced time-exposure photographs of the 
resonant configurations of the system.  

 
Even though the present topic is well established, it is still very relevant today. 
For example, it has recently been shown, by Allen and Schmidt,11 for example, that the 
modes of vibration of a classical, non-relativistic string with a heavy mass at one end are 
of relevance in the study of quantum strings. Generally speaking, the problem of a heavy 
loaded chain or cable is also of interest for pedagogical reasons. For one, it can provide 
an interesting opportunity for students to gain a deeper understanding of the methods of 
mathematical physics, by working in a concrete manner with Bessel functions. It can 
further help students to develop a better understanding of more realistic resonating 
systems, of their deformations, and of their normal modes. 

 
The present article considers the motion of a chain or heavy cable that has its 
upper extremity fixed to a uniformly rotating vertical axis while its lower extremity is 
also pinned, yet allowed to rotate about the same vertical axis. The lower extremity of the 
specimen is further subjected to a non-vanishing external load, for stability. The equation 
of motion for this system is solved and the resonant configurations and normal modes are 
obtained and analyzed. As far as we have been able to ascertain, this problem appears not 
to have been considered previously and we believe that it can provide an interesting 
undergraduate project or an effective demonstration relating to the normal modes of a 
more complex system than the idealized cases that are covered at the early level of an 
undergraduate physics program. 

 
An experimental prototype of the above system was built and the collected data 

was compared to the predictions of the model.  

 
In Section II of this article, the equation of motion for the system is solved for the 
normal configurations and modes. Section III describes the experimental set-up that was 
used to collect data. Section IV analyzes the results and compares them to the predictions

of the model. The possible causes of discrepancy between theory and experiment are also 
examined and commented upon.

Consider a heavy, uniform inextensible chain (or cable) of total mass M and 

L

0=z

z =  and forced by a motor to rotate 

length L whose position of static equilibrium in the gravitational field is the vertical z-
axis. The upper extremity of the chain is located at 
around the vertical axis at a known uniform angular velocity Ω . The lower extremity of 
, where it is pinned and put under an additional tension, T
the chain is located at 
0, 
through stiff springs. The situation is illustrated in Fig. 1. The chain is coupled to the 
springs through a bearing that allows the rotation to take place with little friction. The 
bearing can also move vertically by a very small amount, in order to allow the chain to 
enter into one of its normal modes of deformation. At resonance, the chain thus moves 
, which is to be determined.

We now turn our attention to the description of the experimental set-up that was 

used to collect the data.  
 
 

III. 

Experimental set-up and the collected data 

The experimental set-up consisted of a steel lab equipment rack, a variable DC 

power supply, a permanent magnet motor, a wooden block, two fish weighing scales and 
a stroboscope.   The motor was securely bolted to the top of the rack while a wooden 
block was attached to the bottom, through a bearing that allowed rotation around the 
vertical axis.  The wooden block was permitted to move in a vertical direction but two 
fish weighing scales restricted its upward motion thereby providing additional tension.  
The appropriate specimen, a chain or cable, was attached to the motor and wooden block 
using eyebolts and spring link snaps.  We used spring link snaps to attach the chain 
and/or cable so the specimen could be changed easily.  Finally, the apparatus was 
anchored to the floor to increase the stability. 

 
A variable DC power supply was used to control the angular velocity of the motor 

and consequently, the angular velocity of the chain (or cable).  The chain rotated freely 
about its vertical axis and after some time, attained a stable configuration.  The angular 
velocity of the chain was measured using the stroboscope while the applied tension was 
measured using the fish weighing scales.  The measured values for the angular velocities 
and tensions are tabulated in Tables 1 through 3 for two chains and a cable that were used 
in this experiment. The same wooden block was used for all the experiments; its mass of 

 

 

4

0.714 kg exerted a constant tension of 6.997 N at the lower extremity of the specimen. 
Three specimens were examined: a brass chain, a stainless steel chain and a steel cable. 

 
In Figure 1, we present a photograph of the apparatus while one of the chains used 
is rotating in its stable third mode.  The motor is at the top of the rack while the block and 
fish scales are at the bottom, just outside the field of view of the camera. The spring link 
snaps can be seen at the top and bottom extremities of the chain. 

 

Figure 1- A photograph of the apparatus in action taken with a digital camera.  The chain is shown 
rotating in its stable third mode (second overtone).   

 

Table 1 contains the experimental results for the brass chain. The fundamental 

and third modes were both observed using this chain. The fundamental has one anti-node 
and two nodes (one at each end).  The third mode, or second overtone, has three anti-
nodes and four nodes.   The experimental results of Table 1 are presented in two parts: 
the upper and lower parts relate to the fundamental mode and the second overtone, 
respectively. The measured angular velocities are tabulated in rpm in the first column and 
in rad/sec in the second column.  The third column gives the tensions read from the fish 
weighing scales and the fourth column contains the total tension applied to the lower 
extremity of the chain. The results for the steel cable are summarized in Table 2 using the 
same format as in Table 1. Likewise, the results for a stainless steel chain are summarized 
in Table 3. 

 
During our experiments, only the brass chain was able to rotate in its second 

overtone for a period long enough for us to determine the tensions in the fish scales as 
well as the angular velocity.  The other chain and cable were unstable in that mode and 
would quickly begin to rotate in their fundamental modes.

IV.  Analysis and discussion 
 

 Figure 2 presents a graph of the numerical solutions of equation (9); the first 

three roots are given.  The fundamental mode has the lowest frequency and is shown as 
the lower curve, labeled m=0. The first overtone is the next lowest frequency and the 
corresponding curve has been labeled m=1. Finally the second overtone has been labeled 
m=2.   

 
The vertical axis of Figure 2 corresponds to  Ωγ , where  Ω is the observed angular 

velocity of the chain or cable and the horizontal axis corresponds to the total tension that 
was applied at the bottom of the chain.  We note from each of the theoretical curves that 
as the tension increases the resonant angular frequencies also increase; this is in line with 
expectations. The observed frequencies and tensions for all three specimens used in the 
experiment have been superimposed for comparison.  The results are denoted as follows: 
stainless steel chain (inverted triangles); brass chain (asterisks); cable (circles).  The 
associated error bars have also been included. Notice that the observed data falls very 
close to the theoretical curve for the mode corresponding to m=0. The results for the 
second overtone exhibit a larger deviation from the predicted behavior. However when 
the error bars for the data are taken into consideration, the general trend of the data agrees 
reasonably well with that predicted by the model used. 
 

 
Among the reasons why the experimental results differ from those predicted by 

the model, the most important is perhaps the cork-screw-like motion that the chain 
undergoes while rotating. Indeed, each link of the chain must rotate through a small angle 
before the next link can be carried along and made to rotate also. The corresponding 

 

7

transfer of angular motion down the chain then causes the chain to rotate in a cork-screw-
like manner rather than in a vertical plane and friction in the bearing at the lower end 
would likely force the chain to maintain that twist in steady state. This particular aspect 
of the motion was not built into the model used. A secondary source of uncertainty can be 
associated with the fish weighing scales that we used to apply the tension at the bottom of 
the chain.  Using better-quality and well-calibrated scales would likely result in a 
decrease in size of the horizontal component of the error bars. 

 
The theoretical shape of the chain was also compared to the actual physical shape 

of the chain. Fig. 3 shows an example of a frame taken from a movie clip showing the 
physical shape of the two chains while they were rotating in their fundamental modes.  
The left hand panel shows the numerical results that were obtained from our model, using 
Eq. 8. The middle and right-hand panels show frames for the stainless steel and the brass 
chains, respectively. One can see from these picture-frames that the general features of 
the predicted shapes are in agreement with the actual shapes of the rotating specimens.

frequencies are plotted for the stainless steel chain (inverted triangles), the brass chain (asterisks) 
and cable (circled).  Also shown are the error bars associated to each observation.

stainless steel and brass chains are shown in the middle and in the right panels, respectively.  

 

IV.  Concluding remarks 
 
The motion of a vertical chain that is pinned at both ends and made to rotate 
around the vertical in the gravitational field was considered. A simple model for the 
rotational dynamics of the system was used and the resulting equation of motion solved 
for the stationary configurations and normal frequencies. The predictions of the model 
were compared to data collected from three different specimens, two chains and one 
cable. The results for the lower modes agree reasonably well with the predictions of the 
model. Friction at the lower bearing of the assembly appears to have been the main 
source of deviation between the predictions of the model and the experimental results. 

 
We suggest that a study of the above system can have pedagogical value by 
allowing students to develop a better understanding of an application of Bessel functions 
and of the complex behavior of a real system.

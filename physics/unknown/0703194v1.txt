Abstract 

 

 

 

with  

Boltzmann's differential equation is replaced by the corresponding reciprocal symmetric 

finite difference equation. Finite difference translates discreteness of energy. Boltzmann's 

function, then, splits into two reciprocally related functions. One of them gives Planck’s 

radiation relation and the other one gives the corresponding Fermi-Dirac relation. 

1. Introduction 

 
We have observed that spin is related to reciprocal symmetric transformation1. A related 

question  is  whether  there  is  any  relation  between  reciprocal  symmetry  and  quantum 

statistics. This we shall study in this paper.   

2. Planck's Radiation Formula and Relation to Statistics 

 
The formula for the distribution of light in a black body is given by2

Conclusion 

 

 

 

Following  the  procedure  for  getting  Planck’  relation,  we  have  obtained  Fermi-Dirac 

distribution relation from reciprocal symmetry only. No postulate of quantum statistics – 

like exclusion principle – is invoked.

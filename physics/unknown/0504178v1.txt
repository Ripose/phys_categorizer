A  great  deal  of  attention  has  recently  been  attracted  to  a  new  type  of  smart 

materials, 

so-called 

left-handed  media,  which 

exhibit  highly  unusual 

electromagnetic  properties  and  promise  unique  device  applications,  including  a 

perfect  lens  [1-9].  Left-handed  materials  require  negative  permeability  µµµµ,  an 

extreme  condition  that  so  far  was  achieved  only  for  microwave  frequencies  by 

using  arrays  of  metal-wire  resonators  [1,4-13].  Extension  of  this  approach  from 

microwaves  to  visible  light  presents  a  formidable  if  not  impossible  challenge  [12-

17],  as  no  material  –  natural  or  artificial  –  is  known  to  exhibit  any  magnetism 

above  terahertz  frequencies.  Here  we  report  a  nanofabricated  medium  made  of 

electromagnetically coupled pairs of gold dots with geometry carefully designed at 

a  10-nm  level.  The  medium  exhibits  strong  magnetic  response  at  visible-light 

frequencies,  including  bands  with  negative  µµµµ.  The  magnetism  arises  due  to  the 

excitation  of  quadrupole  plasmon  resonances.  Our  approach  shows  for  the  first 

time  the  feasibility  of  magnetism  at  optical  frequencies  and paves  a way  towards 

magnetic and left-handed components for visible optics.  

 

 

 

 

The  standard  theory  forbids  any  significant  magnetism  at  optical  frequencies. 

Indeed, the renowned reference in theoretical physics by Landau and Lifshitz explicitly 

reads  [16]  “there  is  certainly  no  meaning  in  using  the  magnetic  susceptibility  from 

optical frequencies onwards, and in discussion of such phenomena we must put µ=1”. 

This  statement  is  strongly  supported  by  experiment:  magnetic  susceptibility  χ  of  all 

natural  materials  tails  off  at  microwave  frequencies  [16].  Still, there  may  be  a  way  to 

overcome the fundamental limitations. Pendry et al have recently suggested exploiting 

the  inductive  response  of  normal  metals  to  obtain  high-frequency  magnetic  response 

from structured nonmagnetic materials [10]. The idea was successfully implemented by 

using arrays of copper split-rings, and the man-made magnetism was demonstrated for 

frequencies  up  to  1  THz  [11-13].  In  this  case,  magnetism  emerges  due  to  collective 

motion of a large number of electrons (in essence, due to eddy currents), and theoretical 

arguments  as,  e.g.,  in  ref.  [16]  –  valid  for  individual  electrons  and  atoms  –  no  longer 

hold.  It  is  tempting  to  exploit  the  idea  further  and  create  a  visible-light  version  of 

magnetic  and  left-handed  media.  Unfortunately,  the  direct  scaling  [13]  of  the 

demonstrated  microwave  media  to  visible  optics  is  impossible.  This  would  require 

artificial  structures  with  sizes  down  to  100nm  –  to  match  visible  wavelengths  –  and 

critical features [10-13] controlled on the level of ≈10nm, which is hardly possible for 

the  case  of  the  split-ring  geometry.  Even  more  importantly,  the  scaling  can  fail  on 

principle  because  of very  different  electromagnetic responses of  materials  to light  and 

microwaves  (e.g.,  it  was  predicted  that  inherent  losses  should  limit  the  approach 

demonstrated in refs [11-13] to frequencies well below optical [12,17]). 

We  have  achieved  strong  magnetic  response  at  optical  frequencies  by  using 

plasmon  resonances  excited  in  interacting  metal  structures  of  a  sub-100nm  size.  Fig.1 

shows  an  example  of  our  devices  and  explains  the  basic  idea  behind  the  experiment. 

The studied structures were Au pillars microfabricated by high-resolution electron-beam 

lithography.  Heights  h  of  Au  pillars  (85±5nm)  and  their  diameters  d≈100nm  were 

chosen  through  numerical  simulations  so  that  the  plasmon  resonance  characteristic  to 

individual pillars appeared at red-light wavelengths, λ≈670nm. This resonance is clearly 

seen in the experimental spectra in Fig.2 (curve #1).  

In  addition  to  the  reference  structures,  where  individual  Au  pillars  were  well 

separated by distances D≈0.5µm, we have simultaneously fabricated samples consisting 

of  exactly  the  same  pillars  but  grouped  in  tightly  spaced  pairs.  A  number  of  different 

structures  were  studied  with  d  between  80  and  120nm  and  the  separations  s  between 

centres of adjacent pillars in the range 140 to 300nm and, i.e. the gap s–d between the 

neighbouring  pillars  varied  from  200nm  down  to  just  20nm.  At  these  distances,  the 

electromagnetic  interaction  between  neighbouring  pillars  becomes  essential,  and  a 

plasmon  resonance  of  an  individual  pillar  splits  into  two  for  a  pair  of  pillars  (see 

Figs.1&2). These resonances are referred to as symmetric and antisymmetric, similar to 

the case of any classical or quantum system with two interacting parts and in agreement 

with the notations used for plasmon resonances in nanoparticles [18,19]. 

For  the  symmetric  (also  known  as  dipole)  resonance  (DR),  electrons  in 

neighbouring  pillars  move  in  phase,  similar  to  the  case  of  non-interacting  pillars.  The 

DR  shifts  to  lower  frequencies  with  increasing  the  interaction  (decreasing  s)  (Fig.2c). 

The  dipole  mode  is  of  secondary  interest  for  the  purpose  of  our  report:  It  is  the 

antisymmetric  mode  that  gives  rise  to  magnetic  response.  In  the  latter  mode,  electric 

charges in neighbouring pillars move in anti-phase so that the oscillating dipoles cancel 

each other leaving only  a quadrupole response [18,19]. One can see in Fig.1c that  the 

anti-phase movement of electrons along the z-axis effectively results in a current loop in 

the z-x plane. This high-frequency electric current generates a non-negligible magnetic 

field  in  the  y-direction.  Note  a  similarity  between  the  double-pillar  geometry  and  the 

split-ring resonators used in negative-µ microwave optics. Indeed, a pair of pillars can 

be  thought  of  as  a  ring  with  two  slits  at  the  opposite  sides.  Such  changes  in  the 

geometry of resonators when moving from microwaves to optics resemble the changes 

 

 

known  for  lasing  techniques,  where  complex  closed  resonators  used  in  masers  were 

later replaced in lasers by a pair of mirrors [20,21]. 

The antisymmetric (quadrupole) resonance (QR) was observed in our experiments 

in the green-light range (λ≈450-550nm) and only for structures with s−d <100nm. The 

critical  signature  of  this  resonance  is  its  shift  to  higher  frequencies  with  decreasing  s, 

directly opposite to the behaviour of the dipole resonance (Fig.2c). Using analogies with 

negative-µ  microwave  optics,  one  can  expect  a  strong  dependence  of  excitation 

efficiency  of  this  resonance  on  light  polarization  [11].  The  insets  in  Fig.3a  show  that 

this is also  the  case  for our  optical  media.  If illuminated by perpendicular  white light, 

our structures look amber for one polarization (electric field along the x-axis), similar in 

colour  to  the  media  consisting  of  individual  pillars  or  pairs  with  large  s.  This  colour 

comes  from  DR.  In  contrast,  for  the  perpendicular  polarization,  the  structures  usually 

look green due to a large contribution from the QR. The full spectral dependence of the 

reflectance as a function of the wavelength λ and the polarization angle θ is plotted in 

Fig.3b.  

The observed optical spectra are well described by the standard dispersion theory 

[22],  which  has  also  been  used  for  analysis  of  microwave  spectra  of  negative-µ 

materials.  The  DR  is  caused  by  an  oscillating  electric  moment  and,  accordingly, 

contributes to permittivity as

effective  oscillator  strength,  which  is  proportional  to  the  density  of  pillars  and  an 

efficiency  of  excitation  of  the  resonance  by  incident  light.  There  is  no  net  magnetic 

moment  attributable  to  DR.  In  contrast,  for  the  quadrupole  mode,  the  total  dipole 

moment of a pillar pair is zero and, hence, QR’s contribution to permittivity is zero. The 

 

 

 

 

electromagnetic  response  at  the  QR  appears  due  to  an  oscillating  magnetic  moment, 

which results in “Pendry-type” permeability [12,13]

λ∆   and  fa  are  the  same  notations  as  above  but  for  the  antisymmetric 

resonance.  Note  that  non-zero  excitation  efficiency  of  this  resonance  requires  a 

symmetry  breaking,  which  was  achieved  by  making  pillars  non-cylindrical  (see  Fig.3 

caption).  To  calculate  the  sample  reflectance,  we  combined  these  dispersion  relations 

with Fresnel’s  coefficients for thin  anisotropic  films  [22-24].  The  solid lines in Fig.2a 

show results of our  calculations. For examples, in  the  case  of  sample  #3, our  analysis 

yields ∆λs=170nm and ∆λa=57nm, fs=0.17 and fa=0.05. Note that the QR is noticeably 

narrower  than  the  DR  (∆λa<∆λs).  We  attribute  this  to  the  cancellation  of  radiative 

(dipole)  losses  in  the  quadrupole  mode.  According  to  the  above  analysis,  magnetic 

susceptibility χ of sample #3 reaches a minimum value of about −0.23 near the QR. For 

sample  #4  in  Fig.3a,  the  diamagnetic  response  is  larger,  and  χ  reaches  −0.5  at  λa 

≈470nm. At the  same wavelength, the contribution  from  DR also  gives  rise to a  large 

negative permittivity ε ≈-0.98.  

Magnetic  response  in  the  plasmon  media  can  be  increased  by  increasing  the 

density  of  pillars.  However,  in  this  case,  optical  spectra  become  rather  complicated, 

because  of  the  interaction  between  non-nearest  pillars.  Instead,  in  order  to  increase  χ, 

we used the fact that QRs in nanoparticles [26,27] can be enhanced by placing them in a 

medium with a high refractive index n. To this end, we covered our samples with a thin 

(<100nm)  layer  of  glycerine.  This  led  to  a  significant  increase  in  the  strength  of  QRs 

(by a factor of 2 to 3), which was accompanied by their red shift by ≈50nm (see Fig.3a). 

The  observed  shift  is  in  agreement  with  the  amount  of  red  shifts  reported  for  QRs  in 

nanoparticles [26]. The increased strength of QRs led to a proportional increase in |χ| so 

that negative values of µ were achieved routinely. For example, after covering sample 

 

 

#4  with  glycerine  (Fig.3a),  χ  was  found  to  be  ≈–1.3  at  the  resonance  (i.e.  µ=-0.3). 

Although some of our structures exhibited negative µ and ε within the same range of λ 

(ε=-0.7 for the sample #4 at the QR resonance), µ also had a large imaginary component 

(µ′′ ≈1i at the resonance), which so far did not allow the demonstration of the negative 

refraction. But there are no principle limitations for further enhancement of µ by using 

denser  arrays  or  by  improving  the  excitation  efficiency  in  the  quadrupole  mode  by 

optimising the design of plasmon resonators (e.g., by making pillars more conic). The 

latter  seems  to  be  the  most  viable  way  towards  practical  left-handed  media  at  visible 

frequencies.  

In our experiments, we have also obtained an independent proof for magnetism at 

optical  frequencies,  beyond  the  discussed  comparison  between  experimental  and 

theoretical spectra (note that such comparison is widely accepted as standard - see, e.g., 

[13-17]).  It  is  the  observation  of  impedance  matching  that  allowed  us  to  confirm 

directly  and  qualitatively  that  our  structures  had  large  χ  at  green-light  wavelengths. 

Figure 4 explains the impedance matching phenomenon. The effect is characterised by 

the  total  suppression  of  the  reflection  from  an  interface  between  two  media  with 

different  refraction  indices  n=(εµ)1/2  but  the  same  impedance  values  Z=(ε/µ)1/2.  The 

impedance matching is well known in the physics of electrical circuits and antennas but 

has  never  been  observed  for  visible  optics  (as  it  requires  µ≠1).  Figure  4a  shows  a 

reflection image of one of our structures in polarized green light with the electric field 

along  the  y-axis.  In  this  polarization,  as  discussed  earlier,  the  QR  is  not  excited. 

Accordingly, the patterned medium is seen as a darker area on top of a glass substrate. 

On the other hand, if the same structure is illuminated in the perpendicular polarisation, 

which  does  excite  the  quadrupole  mode,  the  intensity  contrast  disappears  so  that  the 

sample is no longer visible (Fig.4b). The disappearance is due to the matching between 

impedances of air (Zair=1) and the patterned structure (Zs=1). The latter exhibits both ε 

and  µ  equal  to  0.73+0.13i  for  λ=540nm,  as  found  from  the  analysis  of  the  sample’s 

spectra. At the same time, the difference in optical properties of the two media can still 

be visualised because they have different refraction indices n (ns=0.73+0.13i ≠ nair=1). 

This leads to a phase difference acquired by the reflected light, which was converted to 

an intensity contrast by using the standard phase contrast technique (Fig.4c). 

In  summary,  we  have  proved  the  concept  of  an  artificial  medium  with  large 

magnetic response at optical frequencies, including regions with negative both µ and ε. 

This  is  a  principal  step  forward  from  the  previously  demonstrated  magnetism  at 

microwave frequencies towards left-handed visible optics.

frequencies. (a) Scanning electron micrograph (viewed at an angle) of an array 

of Au nanopillars. (b,c) – Numerical simulation of the distribution of electric 

currents inside a pair of such pillars for symmetric and antisymmetric 

resonances, respectively. There exist two other symmetric and antisymmetric 

modes with dipoles oscillating along x- and y-axes. For perfectly cylindrical 

pillars, the symmetry forbids the excitation of antisymmetric modes for any 

direction of incident light. However, due to the slightly conical shape of the 

pillars, which breaks the centre symmetry, light incident along z-axis with the 

electric field along x-axis can excite the antisymmetric mode shown in (c). The 

non-cylindrical shape was intentionally introduced in our design through a 

choice of microfabrication procedures and is a result of Au evaporation through 

an opening in a resist mask, which becomes increasingly narrower during 

evaporation. Light incident along z-axis used in our experiments also excites the 

symmetric modes in x-y plane (not shown).

λa=500nm, ∆λa=57nm for #3. Blue arrows indicate positions of dipole and 

quadrupole resonances. The effective thickness was measured by ellipsometry 

and was close to the mass thickness (≈10nm for all three samples), in 

agreement with numerical simulations [24,25]. (b) Zoom in the spectrum of

are for sample #4 (s=140nm, D=400nm); squares are for the same sample 

covered with a thin layer of glycerine (n=1.47). The insets show optical 

photographs of sample #4 (size 0.3x0.3mm2) observed at the normal angle of 

white light incidence for the two light polarizations. White stripes beneath the 

optical photographs show the colour of a non-patterned gold film of the same 

thickness (note that the plasmon resonance in a continuous film cannot be 

excited by perpendicular incident light, for symmetry considerations). We 

emphasize that the observed polychroism is not an interference or form-

birefringence effect but appears due to the sensitivity of the excited plasmon 

resonances to the incident light polarization.  (b) Reflection spectra for 

monochromatic normal incident light as a function of its polarisation angle θ 

plotted in the polar co-ordinates for sample #4. The polar distance corresponds 

to λ varying from 400 to 700nm; the polar angle θ is counted as shown in the 

insert to the right. The colour scale corresponds to the reflection coefficient 

varying between 7 and 25%.

photograph of the same sample illuminated by the same green light as in (b) but 

viewed using a phase contrast microscopy. Note that the intensity contrast can 

also disappear due to interference effects but in our case this possibility is ruled 

out because of a small effective optical thickness of our media and no evidence 

for the interference at other wavelengths. The phase matching requires 

matching of both real and imaginary parts of the impedance, which places 

rather stringent conditions on relation between the strengths and wavelengths 

of magnetic and dipole resonances. These conditions were met for the 

particular structure, which exhibited fs=0.15, λs=650nm, ∆λs=120nm, fa=0.034, 

λa=570nm, ∆λa=30nm.

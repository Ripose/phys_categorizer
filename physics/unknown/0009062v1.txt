Two exact derivations of the mass/energy relationship, 
E=mc2 

Eric Baird  (eric_baird@compuserve.com) 

The E=mc2 relationship is not unique to special relativity. Einstein published one exact 
derivation  from  special  relativity  and  two  approximate  derivations  that  used  general 
extensions to Newtonian mechanics, and an exact derivation is also possible if we use 
a “first-order”  Doppler  equation  instead  of  special  relativity's  "relativistic  Doppler" 
formula. We present two sample derivations based on different non-transverse Doppler 
relationships, and briefly look at the two diverging systems of physics that result.

 INTRODUCTION

 ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES  

The E=mc2 relationship between mass 
and energy was first made explicit in a short 
piece by Einstein (“On the Origin of Inertia” [1]) 
which was written as a postscript to the 
famous 1905 “Electrodynamics” paper, [2]  
and which presented the E=mc2 result as a 
consequence of the mathematical relationships 
that had appeared in the earlier piece. W. L. 
Fadner has also unearthed and discussed a 
number of contemporary pieces that either 
came close to deriving E=mc2, or presented 
similar equations without fully exploring the 
consequences or claiming the result to be 
general. [3]  

Further pieces by Einstein in the 1940s 
presented the E=mc2 relationship as a result 
that could be derived (approximately) from 
general principles without making specific 
reference to special relativity, [4][5] and we can 
also obtain an exact derivation by applying 
relativistic principles to a different shift formula 
to the one used by special relativity.  

Various authors have reworked the E=mc2 

result since. [6][7][8][9][10] What appears to 
be missing from the literature is a direct 
comparison between derivations based on 
these two different shift formulae, and this is 
what we present here.

Newton, Optiks 3:1:Qu30:  “Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, and may not Bodies receive much of their 
Activity from the particles of Light which enter their Composition? For all fix'd Bodies being heated emit Light so long as they 
continue sufficiently hot, and Light mutually stops in Bodies as often as its Rays strike upon their Parts, as we shew'd above. ...   
The changing of Bodies into Light, and Light into Bodies, is very conformable to the Course of Nature, which seems delighted with 
Transmutations. ...  And among such various and strange transmutations, why may not Nature change Bodies into Light, and Light 
into Bodies?”

 E=mc², FROM A FIRST-ORDER DOPPLER FREQUENCY-SHIFT FORMULA: 

Non-radiating particle  

A particle travels forwards at v m/s inside a nominally-stationary box.  
When the particle hits the rear wall of the box, it gives the box a forward momentum of mv. We will set the mass of the 
particle to be extremely small compared to the mass of the box, so that the change in box velocity caused by the impact is 
arbitrarily small. 

Radiating particle 

The particle emits a burst of energy E before it hits the box, as two plane waves each with energy E/2 in the particle’s 

frame, one traveling "forwards" and one traveling "backwards" along the particle's path. The speed of the particle is not 
affected by the emission, because the reaction forces of both plane-waves (in the particle’s own frame) are equal and 
opposite.  

However, in the frame of the box, the two waves do not have the same energy or momentum.  

The frequency of the forward-aimed wave is blueshifted by  

, the frequency of the rearward-aimed wave is redshifted by  

freq' / freq = (c-v) / c 

freq' / freq = (c-(-v)) / c 

, and the energies of the two waves as they impact on the box are altered by the same amount.  
 
If the individual momentum of each wave is given by E / 2c, the combined forward momentum of the two waves striking 
the opposite sides of the box, is calculated as:  

E [ (c+v) - (c-v) ] / 2c2 

= Ev/c² 

, so (in the box frame) the two pulses of light emitted by the particle carry Ev/c² of total forward momentum.  

If the particle and its emitted light have the same total overall momentum before and after emission takes place, then 

after emission the forward momentum of the particle must be reduced by the same amount, Ev/c².  

 
Since our “spent” particle has reduced momentum but an unchanged velocity, we can apply 

to calculate a reduced value for the mass of the particle after emission.   

mass = momentum/velocity 

mass1 - mass2 = (mom1 - mom2) / v  

massLOST = (Ev/c²) / v  

massLOST = E/c² 

In order to lose an amount of inertial mass m, a particle with a fixed velocity has to lose an amount of energy (measured in 
its own frame) equal to  

E = mc² 

 

 

If we want to try this derivation for pairs of plane-waves aligned at angles other than 0° and 180°, we need to know the exact 
aberration angle-changes associated with our first-order Doppler equation. This derivation will be attempted in a future paper.

 E=mc², FROM SPECIAL RELATIVITY’S FREQUENCY-SHIFT FORMULA: 

Non-radiating particle 

A particle travels forwards at v m/s inside a nominally-stationary box.  
When the particle hits the rear wall of the box, it gives the box a forward momentum of mv. We will set the mass of the 
particle to be extremely small compared to the mass of the box, so that the change in box velocity caused by the impact is 
arbitrarily small. 

Radiating particle 

The particle emits a burst of energy E before it hits the box, as two plane waves each with energy E/2 in the particle’s 

frame, one traveling "forwards" and one traveling "backwards" along the particle's path. The speed of the particle is not 
affected by the emission, because the reaction forces of both plane-waves (in the particle’s own frame) are equal and 
opposite.  

However, in the frame of the box, the two waves do not have the same energy or momentum.  

The frequency of the forward-aimed wave is blueshifted by  

freq'/freq = c / (c+(-v))  ×  (cid:214) (1 - v²/c²)  

, the frequency of the rearward-aimed wave is redshifted by 

freq'/freq = c / (c+v)  ×  (cid:214) (1 - v²/c²) 

, and the energies of the two waves as they strike the box are altered by the same amount. 
If the individual momentum of each wave is given by E / 2c, the combined forward momentum of the two waves striking 
the opposite sides of the box, is calculated as: 

E/2c  ×  [ c/(c-v) - c/(c+v) ]   ×   (cid:214) (1 - v²/c²)    
=   [ Ev/c²  /  (1 - v²/c²) ]   ×  (cid:214) (1 - v²/c²) 

=    Ev/c²  /  (cid:214) (1 - v²/c²) 

, so (in the box frame) the two pulses of light emitted by the particle carry Ev/c² / (cid:214)( 1 - v²/c²) of momentum, and if total 
momentum is conserved, the act of emission must reduce the particle’s momentum by this amount.  

Since our “spent” particle has reduced momentum but an unchanged velocity, we can apply 

to calculate a reduced value for the mass of the particle after emission.     

mass = momentum/velocity 

mass1 - mass2 = (mom1 - mom2) / v 
massLOST = (Ev/c²)/v  /  (cid:214) (1 - v²/c²) 

massLOST = E/c²  /  (cid:214) (1 - v²/c²) 

We can now rearrange this so that the "E" term is on the left. In order to lose an amount of inertial mass m, a particle 

with a fixed velocity v has to lose an amount of energy equal to  

E = mc²  /  (cid:214) (1 - v²/c²) 
Since the total (Lorentz-dilated) mass of this particle under SR [11] is  

mTOTAL = mREST  /  (cid:214) (1 - v²/c²) 

, we can get rid of the Lorentz term by either:  

•  making v=0 and m=rest mass, (so that v²/c²=0, and the Lorentz term disappears) or  
•  making v>0 and using m as Lorentz-dilated mass (in which3 case the two Lorentz terms cancel).  

Either way, we then get the more general relationship  

E = mc² 

 

This is essentially Einstein’s 1905 derivation, for f=0.  The concept of Lorentz mass-dilation is now considered by some people 
to be “old-fashioned”, but is still arguably valid for a ”historical” derivation.

5.  COMPARISON OF THE TWO DERIVATIONS 

Although both derivations produce the 

same nominal result, the resulting physics is 
different in each case.  

 A      First derivation (non-standard) 

With the first-order Doppler formula used 

in Section 3, the wavelength of the forward-
emitted wave does not become infinite in the 
lab frame until the forward velocity of the 
particle is also infinite. This inability of the 
particle to catch up with and overtake its own 
wavefront even at nominally “superluminal” 
velocities means that a model based around 
this derivation does not use a single fixed 
speed of light – the speed of a signal leaving 
the “moving” particle’s nose must be different to 
the speed of a signal emitted by a similar 
particle that is stationary in the laboratory 
frame.  

If we take the root product of the object’s 

apparent ageing rates when viewed at 0° and 
180° to its path, we get an averaged rate of 
apparent timeflow for the object of (cid:214) (1 - v2/c2), 
which is the counterpart of the Lorentz time-
dilation effect under special relativity.   

Emitter-theory and “dragged-light” models 

should show this behaviour. In contrast to 
special relativity, these variable-lightspeed 
models allow speeds up to and beyond 
cBACKGROUND, with the “imaginary” Lorentz result 
for v>cBACKGROUND being a consequence of the 
breakdown of direct observations of a 
superluminally-receding object.  

Emitter-theories based on flat spacetime 

are known not to work.  [12][13][14] 

 B      Second derivation (special relativity) 

With the so-called “relativistic Doppler“ 

equation (second derivation) the energy of the 
forward-emitted wave becomes infinite in the 
background frame as v tends to c, and the 
requirement that no more energy can be taken 
out of the experiment than was put in dictates 
that the amount of energy required to give our 
particle a velocity v also tends towards infinity 
as v tends to c.  

This still leaves the question of whether 
the “c” in question refers to cBACKGROUND or to  
cPARTICLE – these can have different values in a 
dragged-light model, where v=cPARTICLE 
represents an unattainable upper limit, with the 

particle and its forward-emitted light only having 
the same nominal speed when both have an 
infinite velocity in the lab frame.  

Under special relativity, these issues are 
avoided by declaring that spacetime is wholly 
undistorted by relative velocities between 
physical particles (“spacetime is flat”). The 
forward-emitted wave traveling at cPARTICLE is 
then also traveling at cBACKGROUND, and the upper 
limit to the particle’s speed has a definite finite 
velocity in the laboratory frame. There is again a 
calibrated Lorentz reduction in the apparent rate 
of timeflow for a moving object, with the rate 
becoming “imaginary” for v>c, but the infinite 
“energy barrier” at v=c arguably makes this a 
moot point.  

 

6.  CONCLUSIONS 

Because Einstein’s “inertia” paper was 
published shortly after the electrodynamics 
paper, and presented the E=mc2 relationship as 
a consequence of the equations in the earlier 
piece, it is perhaps natural to suppose that the 
E=mc2 relationship would not have been 
discovered without special relativity.  

However, E=mc2 is also a consequence of 

the first-order Doppler equations associated 
with Newtonian ballistic-photon models, and, 
given Newton’s published hypothesis about the 
interconvertibility of matter and light, [15] the 
significance of the relationship could have been 
recognised much earlier. Fadner’s research [3] 
shows that some contemporary papers did 
include near-derivations, or derivations that were 
presented as limited special cases. 

If we consider the three most fundamental 

non-transverse Doppler equations (the two 
basic first-order equations and special 
relativity’s intermediate “relativistic Doppler” 
equation), only one of the three has not been 
shown to give us an exact derivation of E=mc2  
– and of the two derivations given, special 
relativity’s is not the shortest. Although special 
relativity deserves credit for providing a credible 
theoretical platform that allowed Einstein to 
derive and publish the result, a verification of 
E=mc2 is not necessarily a verification of 
special relativity.

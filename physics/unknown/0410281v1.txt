We  present  the  results  of  studies  of  a  nanosecond  light  pulser  built  following

J.S.Kapustinsky  et  al  original  design  and  using  bright  InGaN/GaN  ultraviolet  and  blue

LEDs produced by NICHIA CHEMICAL. It is shown how timing characteristics of the

pulser depend on the type of LED and the value of power supply voltage.

In the 1985 J.S.Kapustinsky and his colleagues published a beautiful scheme

of an inexpensive compact nanosecond LED pulser [1]. Since that time the pulser

has  become  very  popular  in  astroparticle  physics  experiments  at  least  where  it’s

widely used for time and amplitude calibrations: in high energy neutrino telescopes

like NT-200 in Lake Baikal [2] and ANTARES in the Middeterrenian Sea [3], the

imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope H.E.S.S. [4], the extremely high energy

cosmic ray detector AUGER [5] etc. The popularity ensued from the pulser’s high

performances, simplicity, convenience, and robustness.

The  pulser  is  based  on  a  fast  discharge  of  a  small  capacitor  via  a

complementary pair of RF transistors. An electrical scheme of the pulser is shown

in Fig.1. In the present work we used a blue and UV LEDs, NICHIA NSPB300A

and  NSHU590E  respectively,  as  a  light  source  in  the  pulser.  Emission  spectra  of

the LEDs have peaks occurring at 470 nm and 370 nm respectively [6]. The blue

LED  was  out  of  an  “old”  batch  of  LEDs  manufactured  in  1996.  In  our  previous

paper [7] it was demonstrated that the old LEDs are substantially faster in contrary

to  new  LEDs  of  the  same  type  presently  available  in  the  market.  As  to  the  UV

LEDs so far no differences have been seen in the emission kinetics of the old and

new LEDs.

One of doubtless advantages of the pulser is a possibility to adjust quite easily

the light pulse intensity of LEDs by varying a power supply voltage in contrary to

LED  pulsers  based  on  avalanche  transistors  where  to  change  amplitude  of  light

pulses in a wide range is more complicated. The advent of ultra bright InGaN/GaN

LEDs at the beginning of 90s made the “Kapustinsky’s” pulser much more brighter

with up to 107‚ 108 photons per pulse and ~2‚ 3 ns pulse width. It made the pulser

very much attractive for use in many fields of experimental physics.

We measured light pulses temporal profiles and a relative change of a delay

time of output light pulse from the pulser trigger pulse as functions of the power

supply  voltage.  The  pulser  properties  were  studied  with  a  set-up  shown

schematically in Fig.2. A fast ET9116B PMT [8] produced by Electron Tubes Ltd

with ~0.1 ns time jitter was used for the measurements. The pulser was triggered

by  a  positive  pulse  with  an  amplitude  of  3V  and  50  ns  width  from  a  fast  pulse

generator (Stanford DG535). A short optical cable (OC) was used to illuminate the

PMT photocathode from the pulser. The PMT anode signals were amplified by a

fast  transimpedance  preamplifier  (Preamp)  and  LeCroy  612AM  amplifier  (Amp)

and  fed  to  a  constant  fraction  discriminator  (CFD1).  TDC  LeCroy  2228A  were

used for  the  light  pulses  profiles  measurements.  An  electronic  jitter  of  the  whole

set-up is less than 50 ps. The power supply voltage ‰ Vcc‰

is varied in a range of 7V

‚ 24V. The lower limit corresponds to the voltage at which the light pulses become

to be detected by the PMT. For the pulser’s transistors safety we were forced to set

24 V as the upper limit of ‰ Vcc‰

.

The light pulses waveforms were measured by a time correlated single photon

counting  technique  [9].  In  this  method  a  PMT  photocathode  illumination  is

reduced  to  a  single  photoelectron  level  and  if  a  PMT  time  jitter  is  small,

measurements results will basically account for emission kinetics of a light source

under studies. In our case as mentioned above the PMT time jitter is ~0.1 ns and

inserts nearly negligible contribution to the LEDs light emission kinetics. LeCroy

2249A  ADC  was  used  to  control  a  single  photoelectron  mode  and  to  define  a

discriminator’s threshold which was set to be a quarter of the mean value a single

photoelectron charge.

Dependencies  of  the  LEDs  light  pulses  widths  on  the  value  of  the  pulser

power supply voltage ‰ Vcc‰

 are shown in Fig.3. The light pulse temporal profile of

the UV LED has noticeably stronger dependence on ‰ Vcc‰

 in comparison with the

blue  LED  light  emission  kinetics.  Furthermore  the  UV  LED  starts  to  emit  light

pulses at higher values of ‰ Vcc‰

 due to higher current threshold of the LED. The

width of light pulse (fwhm) widens with the increase of the power supply voltage

‰ Vcc‰ from 0.8 ns at 9 V to 2.8 ns at 24 V for the UV LED and from 1.7 ns at 7 V

to 2.2 ns at 24 V for the blue LED. The light pulses waveforms of the UV LED for

the power supply voltages of 9 V and 24 V are shown in Fig.4, dotted and full lines

respectively.  The  second  peaks  clearly  seen  in  both  spectra  are  attributed  to

photoelectrons backscattered from the PMT’s first dynode [10].  One  can  see  that

the waveform at 24 V is not only slower but conspicuously noisier in comparison

with the 9 V case. It could be explained by the fact that at high current pulses the

UV  LED  has  slow  emission  component  due  likely  to  deep  levels  excitations

[11,12]. This slow emission accounts for high background appearing at high values

of ‰ Vcc‰

. We don’t show here similar waveforms for the blue LED because they

are not so good distinguished as in case of the UV LED.

A  relative  change  of  the  delay  time  between  the  pulser  trigger  pulse  and

output  light  pulse  decreases  slightly  by  ~480  ps  with  the  increase  of  ‰ Vcc‰

  in  a

range of 7‚ 24V for the blue LED. In contrary with the blue LED the delay time for

the UV LED increases by ~730 ps with increase of ‰ Vcc‰

 in a range of 9‚ 24 V.

The  experimental  data  for  the  blue  and  UV  LEDs  are  shown  in  Fig.  5  by  filled

circles  and  triangles  respectively.  To  determine  the  delay  time  we  measured  a

relative  shift  of  the  main  peak  position  of  the  PMT  photoelectron  transit  time

distribution with the change of ‰ Vcc‰

.

Thus the NICHIA blue and UV LEDs are considerably faster at lower values

of the pulser power supply voltage ‰ Vcc‰

. The fastest light emission kinetics has

been observed with the UV LED at the lowest possible value of ‰ Vcc‰

. In this case

the light pulse width is about 0.8 ns and one can see how clearly the backscattered

photoelectrons peak  is  resolved,  see  Fig.4.  Furthermore  the  timing  characteristics

of  the  pulser  based  on  the  NICHIA  UV  LED  have  stronger  dependence  on  the

value  of  the  pulser  power  supply  voltage  in  contrary  to  the  pulser  based  on  the

NICHIA blue LED.

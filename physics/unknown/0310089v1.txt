The approach proposed recently as a spectroscopic tecnique of a boron density determi-
nation in microwave plasma has been expanded for B, Al, Ga, Si atoms and generalized. The
method is based on measurements of relative intensities of pairs of spectral lines belonging
to resonance multiplets having common upper level. It is shown that when the reabsorption
of the lines within plasma is suﬃcient, then the intensity ratios depend on the gas temper-
ature T and the product N L of total density of the ground state atoms N and a length of
a plasma column L. Thus in the case of the B, Al, Ga doublets the temperature T should
be known. The resonance multiplet of Si (three independent intensity ratios) provides an
opportunity to obtain both T and N and even to organize internal check of the applicability
of the proposed method to certain plasma conditions. The ratios were calculated for reso-
nance lines of B, Al, Ga and Si under T = 300 ÷ 2400 K and N L = 107 ÷ 1015 cm−3·m. The
results of numerical calculations and ranges of applicability of the method are discussed.

It is well-known that the ratio of total (integrated over wave numbers) emission intensities
of multiplet components having common upper level depends on partial densities of lower levels
when reabsorption is suﬃcient. But it was not used for determination of atomic densities in
plasma, until recently this eﬀect has been proposed and used for spectroscopic determination of
atomic boron density in microwave plasma [1]. The goal of present work consists in generalization
of this approach for another elements and studies of its ranges of applicability.

Observable intensity ratios of multiplet components may be linked with total density of
atoms N and the gas temperature T (in the case of resonance doublet of boron the dependence
on T has been neglected in [1]) under following assumptions:

1) plasma is homogeneous;
2) a population of the ground state (spread among sublevels of a multiplet structure) is much

higher than that of all excited states;

3) the sublevels are populated according to the Boltzmann law;
4) the proﬁles of the emission and absorption lines are identical, being determined by Doppler
broadening with Gaussian shape (corresponding to Maxwellian velocity distributions of excited
and ground state atoms with the same value of T ).

Then the measured total line intensity Iki (a total ﬂux of photons coming out of the light

source) corresponding to the k → i transition may be written as [2,3]

N is the total density of the ground state (close to the total density of atoms in the plasma
according to the assumption 2), and Ei is an energy of i-th sublevel of a multiplet structure.

Finally, intensity ratio is

One may see that an observable intensity ratio is connected with total density N , the length
of plasma column L and gas temperature T . Thus, measurements of Ikn/Ikm, T and L may be
used for spectroscopic determination of the density N in favourable conditions, when Ikn/Ikm
has enough sensitivity to N ·L (see e.g. [1]).

The dependencies of the intensity ratios on the optical length N L for components of reso-
nance multiplets of B, Al, Ga and Si atoms were calculated for T = 300 ÷ 2400 K, that covers
typical conditions in low-temperature plasmas. Numerical data concerning spectral lines under
the study are listed in table 1. We used N L in cm−3·m, then numerical value of N L is equal to
the particle density for the length of plasma column L = 1 m typical for discharge tubes. The
results of the calculations are shown on ﬁgures 1—5.

One may see that the range of applicability of the method depends signiﬁcantly on the value
of the temperature. For example, for atomic aluminium at T = 300 K limits of measurable N L
are (1 ÷ 6) · 1010 cm−3·m, while at T = 2400 K the product N L may be obtained in the range
(0.7 ÷ 100) · 1010 cm−3·m (for the 5% precision of the relative intensity measurements).

In the case of B the intensity ratio becomes insensitive to temperature T for high enough
optical thicknesses N L. In contrast the same plots for Al, Ga and Si show rather strong depen-
dencies on T even for high values of optical thickness N L what may be used for an estimation
of T .

The peculiarity and main advantage of the proposed method is the opportunity to deter-
minate absolute particle densities from relative intensity measurements, and almost without
calibrations for narrow multiplets. The necessity of independent temperature determination is
its main problem.

The resonance multiplet of Si presents an interesting opportunity to organize the inter-
nal check of the method by use of three independent intensity ratios (one for 2s23p4s 3Po
2 →
2s23p2 3P1,2 doublet and two for 2s23p4s 3Po
1 → 2s23p2 3P0,1,2 triplet). Moreover, one may use
the triplet for simultaneous determination of N L and T by solution of corresponding system of
nonlinear equations and the doublet for the independent check.

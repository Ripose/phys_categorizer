Abstract
—The effect of an external harmonic signal on the characteristics of microwave generation in a non-
relativistic electron beam with virtual cathode (VC) formed in a static retarding electric ﬁeld (low-voltage vir-
cator  system)  has  been  experimentally  studied.  A  signiﬁcant  increase  in  the  vircator  generation  power  is
observed when the frequency of the external signal is close to the frequency of VC oscillations. At large detun-
ings, a broadband chaotic generation is observed.

Microwave  electronic  devices  with  the  active
medium in the form of an electron beam with a virtual
cathode (VC) are promising sources of microwave radi-
ation  on  various  power  output  levels  [1–7].  Recently,
we proposed and studied [6–8] a new scheme of oscil-
lator  with  a VC  (vircator),  which  employs  an  intense
nonrelativistic  electron  beam  (i.e.,  a  beam  with  a
microperveance 
 [9]). In order to form a
A/V
VC in the electron beam, this system employs a scheme
with an additional retardation of electrons. According
to this scheme (called a low-voltage vircator), a nonsta-
tionary  oscillating  VC  is  formed  at  the  expense  of
strong  retardation  of  electrons  in  the  drift  region  [6],
which  makes  possible  the  generation  of  both  single-
frequency  and  broadband  microwave  signals  using
electron beams with small total currents and low densi-
ties [7]. In such regimes, it is possible to study in much
detail  the  physical  processes  in  electron  beams  with
VCs. The low-voltage vircator system is also of interest
as  a  controlled  source  of  medium-power  broadband
chaotic signals in the centimeter and millimeter wave-
length ranges [8].

An  important  problem  in  the  study  of  vircators  is
related to an analysis of the inﬂuence of external signals
on the generation characteristics (spectrum, generation
bandwidth,  power)  in  the  electron  beam  with  a  VC.
This problem is of special interest in view of the possi-
ble  use  of  vircators  as  microwave  ampliﬁers.  Experi-
mental  and  theoretical  investigations  of  the  effect  of
external  signals  on  the  vircator  operation  have  been
reported in [10–13] (see also review [5]). Recently, we
reported [14] on the phenomenon of synchronization of
VC oscillations in a nonrelativistic electron beam under
the  conditions  of  additional  retardation  of  electrons.

However,  the  general  pattern  of  nonautonomous
dynamics in electron-wave systems with VCs is still not
completely clear.

This Letter presents the results of an experimental
investigation  of  the  effect  of  an  external  harmonic
microwave signal on the generation characteristics of a
low-voltage vircator.

The external signal was introduced via an additional
slow-wave system segment
 that was situated between
 7
the second anode, electron gun, and the ﬁrst grid (see
Fig. 1). Application of the external signal leads to mod-
ulation  of  the  elevation  beam  at  the  entrance  of  the
interaction space of the low-voltage vircator. The exter-
nal signal was generated by G4-79 and G4-80 oscilla-
tors.  In  autonomous  regimes  (in  the  absence  of  the
external  signal)  the  low-voltage  vircator  generated  a
narrowband microwave signal with a base frequency of
≈
f
 ~ 0.5%, and an out-

put power of 

 2.0 GHz, a bandwidth of

The external signal frequency was equal to that of the

mous generation (

power of about 200 mW. Thus, we may speak of a rel-
atively large signal ampliﬁcation in the electron-wave
system with VC for an external signal frequency close
to  that  of  the VC  oscillations.  Note  that  the  observed
effect  cannot  be  explained  in  terms  of  the  classical
synchronization  of  autooscillations  in  the  beam  with
VC  [15],  since  a  more  than  tenfold  power  gain  is
observed in the system.

Let us consider the power gain as dependent on the

operates as a narrowband active ﬁlter with a gain on the
order of 10 dB and bandwidth of 
 0.1 (on a 3 dB
level).

It should also be noted that variation of the external
signal frequency leads to a change in the spectrum of
microwave  generation  of  the  low-voltage  vircator.

generation regime lead to the generation of a broadband
≈
  0.2–0.4.  As  the  relative
chaotic  signal  with 
detuning decreases, the generation bandwidth exhibits

monotonic  narrowing  and  the  case  of  ∆f/f  ≈  1  corre-
sponds to VC oscillations in a nearly single-frequency
regime.  Thus,  the  power  ampliﬁcation  of  nonautono-
mous  oscillations  is  accompanied  by  the  transition
from a chaotic broadband oscillations to a narrowband
generation regime close to the regular VC oscillations.

In  conclusion,  we  have  experimentally  demon-
strated  the  possibility  of  a  signiﬁcant  (by  more  than
10 dB)  increase  in  the  power  output  of  a  low-voltage
vircator  under  the  action  of  an  external  signal.  The
power  gain  is  observed  when  the  external  signal  fre-
quency is close to the VC frequency. The effect exhibits
a threshold character with respect to the external signal
amplitude.  The  maximum  output  signal  power  is
reached at an external signal power close to that of the
autonomous generation.

The observed effect can be used for the ampliﬁca-
tion of microwave signals in systems featuring charged
particle beams with VCs. Advantages of the proposed
ampliﬁer are the simple design, the possibility of oper-
ation without a guiding magnetic ﬁeld, and the possibil-
ity  of  tuning  the  frequency  of  ampliﬁed  signals  in  a
broad band by varying the retarding potential applied to
the second grid (electron beam perveance in the inter-
grid gap) [6]. It should be noted that the frequency of
autonomous  VC  oscillations  is  proportional  to  the
plasma frequency of the electron beam (fKC ~ fp) (see,
e.g., [1, 5, 6]). This implies that an increase in fp of the
beam  due  to  a  small  increase  in  the  electron  density
(e.g., with the aid of a magnetron injector gun [7, 16])
makes it possible to move toward the millimeter wave-
length  range  with  prospects  of  creating  a  simple  and
compact low-voltage microwave ampliﬁer based on the
electron beam with virtual cathode.

Abstract 

In  this  work,  we  show  that  by  varying  the  experimental  conditions,  the  driving 

amplitude, a dynamic force microscope allows DNA properties to be selectively imaged. The 

substrate on which the DNA is fixed is a silica surface grafted with silanes molecules ended 

with  amine  groups.  Use  of  small  oscillation  amplitudes  favors  the  attractive  interaction 

between the tip and the sample, while use of large amplitudes renders the contribution of the 

attractive  interaction  negligible.  Particularly,  at  small  amplitudes,  the  images  show  that  the 

attractive interaction is strongly enhanced along the DNA. This enhancement is found to be 

amenable with a model considering a narrow strip of randomly oriented dipoles on each side 

of  the  molecule.  This  work  should  provide  new  insights  on  the  DNA  interaction  and 

conformational changes with localized charges.

I- Introduction 

Investigating  DNA  conformation  and  structure  is  a  long-standing  goal  in  which 

visualization  techniques  have  a  central  importance.  Therefore,  since  the  beginning  of  the 

Scanning  Force  Microscopy,  a  lot  of  experiments  have  been  dedicated  to  studies  of  DNA 

deposited onto a surface [1-5]. Many of them were dedicated to determine the influence of the 

substrate on the chain conformation [6-8]. It is a daily difficulty to evaluate the influence of 

the  sample  preparation,  then  to  be  able  to  extract  information  of  some  use  for  biological 

purpose. Therefore a wide variety of experiments were done, many of them being focussed on 

the  surface  preparation  :  mica,  grafted  mica  or  grafted  silica  surfaces  with  molecules  ended 

with  amine  groups  [6,  8-10].  Other  attempts  aimed  at  studying  the  effect  of  DNA  solutions 

with  different  ionic  strength  and  pH,  particularly  the  influence  of  various  di-cations  was 

investigated  [11-14].  In  many  cases,  experimental  strategies  are  based  upon  the  knowledge 

accumulated with electron microscopy [15]. The delicate balance to achieve is, on one hand, 

to  prepare  a  surface  being  able  to  stick  the  DNA  and  on  the  other  hand,  to  meet  the 

contradictory  requirement  of  being  able  to  spread  the  molecule  to  prevent  formation  of 

aggregates. 

Beyond this difficulty, the Scanning Force Microscopy (SFM) is a tool that measures 

the  interaction  between  a  nanotip  and  a  surface  or  an  object.  Particularly,  for  soft  material, 

rather  than  topography,  SFM  probes  the  mechanical  properties  [16].  Among  the  SFM,  the 

dynamic force  microscopy  (DFM)  has been found as the suitable tool to investigate surface 

morphology of soft material and then has been widely used to image DNA structure. DFM, 

namely Tapping mode, was first conceived to reduce the contact area between the tip and the 

surface, so that the shear forces at the interface are reduced. In addition, recent experimental 

results  and  theoretical  developments  have  emphasized  that  the  non-linear  behavior  of  the 

oscillating  nanotip  at  proximity  of  a  surface  provides  a  very  high  sensitivity  of  the  force 

measurement  [17-19].  Besides  these  findings,  despite  the  name  of  Tapping  mode,  it  was 

shown and demonstrated that intermittent contact and purely non-contact situations between 

the tip and the surface can occur [20-22]. When intermittent contact situations take place, the 

repulsive  tip-sample  interaction  is  dominant  and  the  image  gives  information  about  the 

topography and the mechanical properties of DNA. When purely non-contact situations take 

place, the attractive tip-sample interaction is dominant, and the image gives information about 

the “chemistry” and the different types of interaction that can happen. 

 

3 

In many cases, one obtains a mixing of the two regimes, so that it is worth discussing 

the oscillation behavior of the tip-cantilever system as being the result of a dominant repulsive 

or a dominant attractive regime, rather than to describe the different experimental situations as 

the result of intermittent contact situations or purely non-contact ones. 

As shown below, the two regimes can be straightforwardly discriminated by looking at 

the oscillation behavior, particularly the phase variation. During an experiment, the different 

regimes are finely tuned by varying the oscillation amplitude [21]. Qualitatively, the effect of 

the  oscillation  amplitude  can  be  understood  as  follow  :  let's  consider  a  cantilever  that 

oscillates with an amplitude A at a distance D of the surface (fig.1a), with D > A. For a fixed 

closest distance between the tip and the surface, Δ = D-A, the time during which the tip is at 

proximity  of  the  surface  is  a  function  of  the  oscillation  amplitude  [23].  Use  of  large 

amplitudes leads to a shorter residence time than the one obtained at small amplitudes thus to 

a smaller attractive interaction. A quantitative evaluation is readily deduced from a power law 

dependence describing the attractive interaction between the tip and the surface. For example, 

using  an  effective  Van  der  Waals  sphere-plane  interaction  gives  an  average  attractive  force 

varying as Δ−3/2 from which is derived a strength of the attractive interaction scaling as A-3/2 

[23-25]. 

 

In other words, depending of the regime chosen, one may expect to access to various 

physical and chemical properties of the DNA molecule at the local scale, then to learn a little 

bit more about the way the DNA molecule interacts with its surrounding substrate. 

Taking advantage of these two possibilities, a DNA molecule (a 2500bp fragment of a 

linearized  plasmid,  pSP65)  was  investigated.  The  DNA  solution  was  prepared  with  10mM 

MgCl2, 50 mM NaCl and 10 mM trisEDTA (pH 7) with a concentration of 1µg/ml. Then a 

droplet of 10µl was deposited during 2 minutes on an aminopropyltriethoxysilanes (APTES) 

grafted silica surface. The surface treatment for the grafting is given in detail elsewhere [26]. 

The sample was then rinsed with 30µl of deionized water and dried with a filter.

II- Experimental results 

II-1- Experimental methodology 

The  properties  of  the  oscillating  tip-cantilever  used  [27]  are  the  following  :  the 

resonance frequency is ν0 = 153319 Hz, the quality factor is Q = 410, the experiments were 

performed  at  u  =  ν/ν0  =  0.9989,  corresponding  to  a  phase  ϕfree  =  -45°  and  an  oscillation 

amplitude  Afree  =  A0/ 2   ≈  0.707×A0  for  large  tip-surface  distances,  where  A0  is  the 

amplitude at the resonance frequency and Afree the oscillation amplitude. The subscript “free” 

means that the oscillation conditions are measured at a tip-surface distance for which the tip 

does not interact with the surface, typically distances of ten nanometers or more. The working 

amplitude, A, e.g. the oscillation amplitude used as a set point to control the vertical location 

of the surface with the feedback loop, is always set at A = 0.67×A0, whatever the value of A0. 

The AFM used [28] is set into a glove box in which the PPM (part per million) of water is 

achieved, allowing the oscillator to keep a stable behavior over several weeks. Three surfaces 

were  investigated,  a  silica  surface,  a  silica  grafted  with  aminopropyltriethoxysilanes 

molecules  (APTES),  and  DNA  deposited  onto  the  grafted  surface.  APTES  molecules  were 

chosen because of their ability to stick DNA molecules onto surfaces [9, 10], while the silica 

surface is used as a reference. The experiments were performed with the same tip, without any 

evidence of change of its size and pollution. The stability of the tip was verified by recording 

time to time an approach-retract curve on the reference surface, the silica surface. The curve is 

performed  at  the  oscillation  amplitude  showing  the  transition  regime  between  intermittent 

contact situations and non-contact ones [21, 29]. This method is sensitive but does not mean 

that  the  tip  has  not  been  slightly  modified.  These  measurements  only  indicate  that  if  any 

modifications  happen,  there  are  weak  enough  to  maintain  the  same  attractive  interaction 

between the tip and the surface. 

Since  the  oscillation  amplitude  governs  the  strength  of  the  attractive  interaction, 

approach-retract curves were recorded at different working amplitudes Afree, ranging from 53 

nm  down  to  4  nm.  In  order  to  minimize  any  asymmetric  tip  effect,  the  images  presented  in 

this  work  were  all  recorded  by  scanning  along  a  direction  perpendicular  to  the  cantilever 

symmetry axis. 

 

Silica and grafted silica surfaces were first thoroughly investigated; a detailed analysis 

is given in ref.[29]. Here are recalled a few results to help to understand the recorded image

on DNA. For silica surface, the dominant repulsive regime is obtained down to the resonance 

amplitude A0 = 8 nm. This low value indicates a rather small size of the tip apex. Those small 

tip sizes are scarcely available, typically, our own practice leads to the conclusion that over 

two  hundred  tips,  no  more  than  10  percent  do  show  such  a  low  value.  The  APTES  grafted 

silica surface exhibits a marked, stronger attractive interaction between the tip and the surface 

than the one of the silica alone. 

Recording  approach-retract  curves  [29]  straightforwardly  shows  the  observed 

difference  between  silica  and  grafted  silica  surfaces.  Approach-retract  curves  give  the 

variation of the oscillator’s properties as a function of the tip-surface distance [21], thus are 

the  required  preliminary  measurement  to  determine  the  experimental  conditions  to  any 

recording image. A qualitative picture is readily obtained by looking at the amplitude at which 

the  phase  crosses  the  -90°  value.  Phase  above  (below)  -90°  indicates  a  dominant  repulsive 

(attractive) regime. Figure 2 shows that, using A0 = 31 nm, the recorded grafted surface image 

corresponds to a dominant attractive regime of the oscillator, while the silica surface image, in 

spite of being recorded at a smaller amplitude, keeps the oscillator within a repulsive regime. 

Because  the  tip’s  size  is  a  constant,  this  result  immediately  indicates  that  the  attractive 

interaction between the tip and the surface is much larger on the grafted surface than the one 

observed  on  the  silica  alone.  The  origin  of  the  attractive  interaction  enhancement  can  be 

understood as follow : the pKa of APTES molecules is around 10 [9], thus for silica surface 

treated  in  aqueous  solution  at  pH  3  to  7,  amine  groups  can  be  chemically  modified  as 

ammonium species providing an additional attractive electrostatic contribution. 

II-2- Results on DNA 

The DNA height images shown in figures 3 and 4a were recorded using the repulsive 

regime  (e.g.  intermittent  contact  situations  between  the  tip  and  the  surface  over  the  whole 

surface : A0 = 49 nm and the average phase observed over the surface is -43°). To illustrate 

the main purpose of the present work, we focus on the images (height, left and phase, right) of 

the  figure  4a.  These  images  present  the  interest  of  showing  a  DNA  molecule  with  its 

sequences nearly parallel either to the X or to the Y-axis. Therefore, a possible influence of an 

asymmetric  shape  of  the  tip,  large  enough  to  induce  different  strengths  of  the  attractive 

interaction  between  the  tip  and  the  molecule,  will  be  more  easily  seen  since  the  tip  crosses 

over the molecule along different directions. 

 

6 

The same molecule was observed at different driving amplitudes. Figure 4b shows the 

images  (height  and  phase)  obtained  with  A0  =  11  nm.  The  height  image  shows  a  net 

difference.  At  high  amplitude  (fig.4a),  the  image  exhibits  a  homogeneous  contrast  all  along 

the  molecule,  while  at  driving  amplitude  A0  =  11  nm,  some  parts  of  the  molecule  exhibit 

edges with a strong over-illumination. The driving amplitude A0 = 11 nm and set point were 

chosen to image the grafted surface in a dominant attractive regime (the average phase of the 

surface is close to -123°). When this particular experimental condition is chosen, it occurs that 

above  the  DNA  the  oscillation  behavior  of  the  oscillator  corresponds  to  a  nearly  dominant 

repulsive regime. The different regimes can be straightforwardly deduced from the recording 

of  the  approach-retract  curves  on  the  grafted  surface,  close  to  and  above  DNA.  As  stated 

above, the way the different regimes  are discriminated is  readily obtained by looking at the 

corresponding phase values (fig.5). 

The over-illumination observed corresponds to an apparent higher height at proximity 

of the DNA, height which is not observed when the dominant repulsive regime is used over 

the whole surface (fig.4a, A0 = 49 nm). This apparent increase of the height can be understood 

as  follow.  When  the  Tapping  mode  is  used,  the  tip-sample  distance  is  controlled  through 

variations of the oscillation amplitude. Change of the oscillation amplitude is a consequence 

of change of the interaction between the tip and the surface. As shown in ref.[21], a decrease 

of the amplitude can either be due to repulsive or attractive interaction. When the attractive 

interaction  between  the  tip  and  the  surface  becomes  the  leading  one,  the  decrease  of  the 

amplitude  is  a  function  of  the  strength  of  the  attractive  interaction.  Consequently,  for  non-

contact  situations,  larger  is  the  strength  of  the  attractive  interaction,  larger  is  the  closest 

distance  between  the  tip  and  the  surface  at  which  a  given  reduction  of  the  amplitude  is 

reached. In other words, for the dominant attractive regime, a bright spot means that a higher 

attractive interaction is expected, provide that the surface does not show a bump structure at 

this  particular  location.  Therefore,  the  image  indicates  an  enhancement  of  the  attractive 

interaction  at  proximity  of  the  molecule,  the  molecule  itself  remaining  imaged  with  the 

dominant repulsive regime (e.g. intermittent contact situations between the tip and the DNA). 

 

 

The  amplitude  was  further  decreased  in  order  to  amplify  the  attractive  interaction 

(figs.6). At A0 = 9 nm (fig.6a), the apparent width of the molecule is widened. On the height 

image  (left  part  on  fig.6a),  the  few  dark  spots  on  the  DNA  correspond  to  a  few  remaining 

intermittent  contact  situations  on  the  molecule.  On  the  phase  image  (right  part),  the  height 

 

 

 

7 

dark spots become the bright ones since for these particular spots the phase is higher than the 

one  given  by  non-contact  situations.  At  the  lowest  amplitude,  A0  =  6  nm  (fig.6b),  the 

dominant attractive regime is obtained throughout the surface, including DNA. The molecule 

appears featureless and is further widened. 

The marked evolution of the image as a function of the driving amplitude (figs.4a, 4b, 

6a and 6b) can also be seen by reporting the corresponding cross sections (figs.7a, b, c and d 

respectively).  At  intermediate  amplitude  (fig.7b),  A0  =  11  nm,  shoulders  appear  and  the 

central part shows a small bump. The corresponding phase is above -90°. At A0 = 9 nm, the 

small bump disappears but the shoulders remains quite well separated (fig.7c). At A0 = 6nm, 

the shoulders widen and overlap leading to a featureless structure (fig.7d). 

As shown with these sections, measured heights and widths are very much dependent 

of  the  experimental  conditions  chosen.  This  is  not  surprising  since  the  oscillation  behavior 

depends  on  the  strength  of  the  attractive  interaction  force.  When  the  tip  does  not  touch  the 

surface  or  only  slightly  touches  a  soft  material,  there  is  no  reason  that  the  height  variation 

uniquely gives a topographic information. In addition, the evolution of the cross sections does 

show  that  additional  informations  are  obtained  when  the  amplitude  is  reduced.  This  is 

particularly well verified at the intermediate amplitude (A0 = 11 nm), where both the central 

part of the molecule and the shoulders are observed. As shown with the comparison given in 

figures 4, the contrast on the central part of the molecule is much better than the one obtained 

at  the  highest  amplitude,  showing  unambiguously  the  superstructure  of  the  molecule.  In 

addition, the shoulders are quite narrow with a full width at half height around 5 nm, while at 

A0 = 9 nm the full width is about 10 nm. 

III- Discussion 

The  use  of  different  oscillation  amplitudes  reveals  heterogeneous  attractive 

interactions between the tip and the surface with a particular enhancement close to DNA that 

leads to a supplementary height of about half a nanometer. In addition, this enhancement of 

the attractive interaction is restricted to a limited lateral spatial extension of a few nanometers. 

Therefore, question rises about  the physical origin of such  an enhancement of  the attractive 

interaction producing a very localized effect. 

 

 

 

 

8 

Since DNA molecule at pH 7 bears one negative charge per base, and that the grafted 
+ species, a reasonable assumption is to consider 

surface may also exhibits distribution of NH3

an  additional  electrostatic  interaction  along  the  molecule.  Nevertheless,  considering  a  net 

electrostatic contribution of isolated charges gives a long-range interaction unable to describe 

the locality of the observed enhancement. The shortest range of attractive interaction is given 
by  the  Van  der  Waals  dispersive  interaction  with  an  atom-atom  interaction  varying  as  r-6,  r 

being  the  distance  between  atoms.  A  similar  short-range  power  law  dependence  is  obtained 

when  randomly  oriented  permanent  dipolar  momentums  interact  with  a  collection  of  non-

polar  species  like  the  tip  apex  is.  This  additional  Van  der  Waals  like  interaction  is  called 

Debye interaction [30]. If a short-range interaction is a necessary requirement, it is not enough 

to  get  a  local  interaction  probed  by  the  oscillating  nanotip.  For  example,  the  usual  Van  der 

Waals sphere-plane interaction leads to an attractive interaction force between the tip and the 
surface varying as Δ−2, where Δ is the tip-surface distance. If random dipolar momentums are 

homogeneously  distributed  on  a  quite  large  area,  the  interaction  with  the  tip  will  lead  to  a 

similar smooth variation as a function of the tip-sample distance. Thus, one cannot expect to 

get any drastic variation as a function of the (X;Y) location. By considering a line, or a narrow 

strip of randomly oriented dipoles, because the sum (the integration for the continuous case) is 

over a unique spatial dimension, the power law dependence, scaling as Δ−7/2 (see appendix), 

gives  a  more  sensitive  variation  of  the  attractive  interaction  force  as  a  function  of  the  tip-

sample distance, thus is able to provide a more localized effect of the attractive interaction. 

 

The  above  assumption  is  supported  by  the  possibility  of  having  complexes  made  of 

negative  and  positive  charges  along  the  molecule.  For  instance,  the  presence  of  negative 

phosphate  groups  and  positive  amine  groups  are  suitable  candidates  to  built  permanent 

dipoles.  But  other  additional  and  significant  contributions  can  also  be  issue  either  from  the 
++  which  have 

complexes  made  of  negative  phosphate  groups  and  di-cations  magnesium  Mg

reacted together with the DNA molecules during the preparation of the solution or remaining 

water  molecules  [31].  Water  molecules  on  DNA  are  known  to  be  of  importance  for  the 

location of di-cations [31] and because of their permanent dipoles, might also contribute to the 

enhancement of the attractive interaction. Note that, the contribution of a water meniscus in 

DFM experiments should have a less important effect than the one observed in AFM contact 

mode experiments [32], particularly for non-contact situations (low oscillation amplitudes) for 

which the tip does not touch the surface. 

 

9 

Whatever  the  precise  chemical  constitution  of  dipoles,  let’s  consider  that  the 

distribution of randomly oriented dipoles forms a narrow strip on each side of the molecule. 

Using equ.7 of the appendix and considering two strips of dipoles, the numerical simulation 

(see appendix for more details) gives the cross sections reported in the figure 8a. When the 

oscillation  amplitude  is  varied,  the  numerical  results  reproduce  with  a  good  agreement  the 

general trends experimentally observed (fig.8a and 8b). 

The results given by the simulation support the assumptions employed to interpret the 

over-illumination  along  the  molecule.  This  result  also  suggests  a  mechanism  describing  the 

interaction between the DNA and the grafted substrate through a strong interaction between 

the APTES molecules and the phosphate groups. Here we face the difficult and long-standing 

problem  of  the  substrate  influence.  For  instance,  the  largest  illumination,  thus  the  highest 

attractive  interaction,  occurs  above  superstructures  that  are  identified  as  plectonems  [33-34] 

(fig.4).  Such  a  superstructure  is  not  expected  for  linearized  molecules,  except  if  a  strong 

interaction due to the presence of cations or di-cations locally bends the molecule and screens 

the  repulsive  electrostatic  interaction  between  phosphate  groups  [11,  33-35].  The  structures 

observed together with the over-illumination suggest that the DNA molecule is tightly stuck 

onto the grafted substrate. Also, as for most of the numerous previous experiments [5, 6, 10], 

we do not get the expected DNA height of about 2 nanometers. As a matter of fact, except the 

noticeable result given in ref.[8], in which is clearly shown that the DNA molecule is loosely 

bounded on the substrate, most of the experimental results give DNA heights ranging between 

half  and  one  nanometer.  This  deficit  in  height  can  be  understood  as  another  indication  of  a 

strong interaction between the molecule and the substrate.

Conclusion 

The  present  work  was  an  attempt  to  image  DNA  molecule  with  a  dynamic  force 

microscope  using  various  experimental  conditions  so  that  different  properties  of  the  DNA 

molecule deposited onto a substrate become accessible. The surface chosen is a silica surface 

grafted with silanes molecules ended with amine groups (APTES). Images were recorded at 

different  oscillation  amplitudes.  By  varying  the  oscillation  amplitude,  the  attractive 

interaction  between  the  oscillating  tip  and  the  DNA  is  varied.  Use  of  small  oscillation 

amplitudes  favors  the  attractive  interaction,  while  use  of  large  amplitudes  renders  the 

contribution of the attractive interaction negligible. The images show a marked evolution as a 

function  of  the  oscillation  amplitude  from  which  is  deduced  that  the  attractive  interaction 

along the DNA is much larger than everywhere else on the surface. This enhancement of the 

attractive  interaction  is  found  to  be  amenable  with  a  model  considering  a  narrow  strip  of 

randomly oriented dipoles on each side of the molecule. The numerical simulations performed 

give a good agreement with the experimental results. The present work indicates that with the 

dynamic  force  microscopy,  beyond  studies  of  chain  conformation,  one  can  access  to  the 

distribution of interaction forces on the DNA molecules related to chemical properties.

A-2-  Numerical simulation of a Tapping mode cross section : 

The  numerical  simulations  aimed  to  provide  a  support  for  describing  the  shoulders 

appearing at low amplitudes along the DNA molecule, e.g. in non-contact situation [36]. Two 

lines  of  randomly  oriented  dipoles  are  aligned  at  an  arbitrary  distance  of  1  nm  defining  a 

“strip” of dipoles of 1 nm width. Two strips are considered separated by a distance of 7 nm. 

The  geometry  of  the  problem  is  sketched  on  fig.A1.  The  attractive  interaction  between  the 

surface and the tip is described using a disperse Van der Waals interaction with a sphere-plane 

geometry. 

The  simulation  is  built  in  order  to  reproduce  an  experimental  section  and  the  feedback 

loop  of  the  piezoelectric  ceramic  holding  the  sample.  The  set  point  at  which  the  section  is 

calculated  is  first  reached  with  an  approach  curve.  The  approach  is  performed  far  from  the 

location  of  the  lines  of  dipoles  (Xstart  for  instance  on  fig.A1).  The  vertical  motion  of  the

The quality factor of the experimental oscillator is 410 (see text) and the frequency is 

around 153 kHz. Therefore the characteristic time of the oscillator is 2×410/(153000)≈5 ms. 

This implies that the simulation sampling time is large enough in order to record oscillator’s 

stationary  state  at  each  step  of  the  calculation.  This  is  validated  by  an  adiabatic  criterion 

calculating the number of points required for the whole scan.

 the position of the tip as a function 

of time. H and R are respectively the Hamaker constant of the interface tip-surface and the 
radius of the tip. Their values have been fixed at 10-20 J and 10 nm. The values of A and 

A’  are  49  and  11  nm  (thin  and  thick  continuous lines).  D  and  D’  were  arbitrarily  set  to 

49.5  and  11.5  nm.  The  plot  illustrates  that  the  lower  the  amplitude,  the  stronger  the 

attractive force between the tip and the surface is. 

Comparison  between  two  approach-retract  curves  showing  the  variation  of  the  phase  as  a 

function  of  the  tip-sample  distance  on  the  silica  (empty  circles)  and  on  the  APTES  surface 

(filled circles) with A0 = 21 and 31 nm respectively. The experimental conditions are given in 

the text. The phase variation obtained on the silica indicates that the repulsive regime between 

the  tip  and  the  surface  is  dominant  (ϕ  >  -90°)  in  spite  of  a  smaller  amplitude  than  on  the 

APTES for which the attractive regime is dominant (ϕ < -90°). Thus the attractive interaction 

between the tip and the surface is much larger on the grafted surface than the one on the silica

that the DNA molecule is mostly imaged in the repulsive regime (see text and fig.5). The 

vertical contrasts are 3 nm and 90°. 

Figure 5 : 

Sections of the phase images of the figures 4a (A0 = 49 nm) and 4b (A0 = 11 nm) made on the 

central part of the DNA molecule. With A0 = 49 nm, the repulsive regime is dominant over 

the  whole  surface,  including  DNA  molecule.  The  average  phase  is  –43°  and  the  contrast  is 

weak. This is the reason why the contrast of the image is 10°. With A0 = 11 nm, the surface is 

mostly imaged with the attractive regime. The average phase value is around –123°. On the 

DNA, intermittent contact situation occurs with a phase value above –80°. This is the reason 

why the contrast of the image is 90°. 

a-  Identical zone than the one shown in figures 4, but with A0 = 9 nm. The apparent width of 

the molecule is larger than the one at higher amplitudes. The vertical contrasts are 3 nm 

b-  Same zone, but with A0 = 6 nm. The attractive regime is dominant all over the area. The 

molecule appears featureless. The vertical contrasts are 3 nm and 10°. 

Sections of the height images of the figures 4a, 4b, 6a and 6b made on the central zone of the 

molecule. Reducing the amplitude from A0 = 49 (a) down to 6 nm (d) leads to an increase of 

the  attractive  interaction  between  the  tip  and  the  surface.  As  a  consequence,  the  shoulders 

appearing on the edges of the molecule with A0 = 11 nm (b) become to overlap.

appendix). The numerical oscillations conditions are A0 = 15 (thin line) and 7 nm (thick

The Inverted Big-Bang 
 
Our universe appears to have been created not out of nothing  
but from a strange space-time dust of quantum geometry

Summary: 
• Quantum geometry makes it possible to avoid the ominous beginning of our universe with its 
physically unrealistic – infinite – curvature, extreme temperature, and energy density. It could be 
the long sought after explanation of the big-bang. 
• It perhaps even opens a window into a time before the big-bang – space itself may have come 
from an earlier collapsing universe that turned inside out or inverted and began to expand again. 
 
With the help of one equation, Martin Bojowald tries to look into a time that no one has ever seen – 
into a time before time, into the time before the big-bang. If this equation is correct, the big-bang 
was not the beginning of everything but merely a transition – the end of a previous universe 
collapsing into itself and at the same time turning inside out into a new universe expanding out. The 
young physicist at Max-Planck-Institute for gravitational physics in Potsdam cannot yet say what 
happened exactly before the big-bang. But his results are already so promising, that he has received 
high recognition and collaboration from renowned physicists worldwide. 
 
Obviously equations are not telescopes or time machines that permit us to really peer into this 
presumed precursor-universe. Yet mathematical intuition and physical genius can help us leap into 
this fantasy. A quantum leap in viewpoint is also urgently needed to solve perhaps the biggest 
mystery of physics: the origin of the universe. (By the way, one needs to literally take a quantum 
leap. Often the ignorant metaphor for a large breakthrough, here it is the smallest step in nature 
allowed by the laws of quantum physics.) 
 
Classical physics in the shape of Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity first formulated this 
riddle physically. But it could not solve the problem – rather it pronounced, as it were, its own 
bankruptcy. Soon after the Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann formulated, in 1922 and 1924, 
two equations for the evolution of space in a highly simplified form within the framework of 
relativity theory, it shocked the science with its prediction of the big-bang singularity. General 
relativity theory predicts a boundary at the big-bang, in that the laws of physics break down as does 
the applicability of the theory: space and time shrink to nothing while the curvature of space, 
energy density, pressure and temperature on the other hand grow tremendously. Stephen Hawking 
and Roger Penrose proved rigorously in the 1960s that this conclusion cannot be avoided in general 
relativity. 
 
“General relativity predicts a first moment of time,” comments Lee Smolin, physics professor at the 
Canadian University of Waterloo and the associated Perimeter Institute. “But this conclusion 
disregards quantum physics. For relativity theory is not a quantum theory” and thus, in the last few 
years the hopes of cosmologists to crack the mystery of the big-bang singularity have grown 
stronger.

With quantum geometry, a new highly developed tool, physicists now stand to close this painful 
gap in relativity – that is to say, to fill the gap with a new worldview. For in quantum geometry, 
space and time are not continuous and flowing, as in relativity (as also assumed in quantum theory), 
but rather granular and discrete, as if it were made out of space-time atoms. In quantum geometry, 
this space-time dust is called a spin network or spin foam – the submicroscopic tissue of the world. 
This tissue, Martin Bojowald and his colleagues believe, has no holes in the big-bang either. 
 
“Quantum physics does not stop at the big-bang,” says Abhay Ashtekar, physics professor at 
Pennsylvania State University and co- founder of quantum geometry. “Classical space-time 
‘dissolves’ near the big-bang, but the spin network is still there.” It is to a certain extent eternal. 
“There was thus no emergence of the universe from ‘nothing’ because ‘nothing’ simply does not 
exist. There was always something already.” 
 
In this manner quantum geometry has the philosophical advantage of simply getting rid of 
apparently unsolvable questions. Here its strength, the independence of the theory from a 
background space-time metric, makes itself especially noticeable. Ashtekar: “Matter and geometry 
should both be born together quantum mechanically.” 
 
When he was working as a postdoctoral researcher with Ashtekar, Martin Bojowald demonstrated 
how the spin network could have ignited the big-bang. His quantum-cosmological time evolution 
equation – a refined quantization of the Friedmann equation – strains the ordinary imagination and 
comprehension to the extreme. But it triumphs over the large question mark in relativistic 
cosmology: the big-bang singularity. For out of the perspective of quantum geometry, classical 
space-time disappeared when our universe was only 10-29 centimeters in size. This is not to down-
play the big bang. At this moment the curvature of space-time was tremendously large even in the 
context of quantum geometry cosmology – “about 1077 times that at the horizon of a solar mass 
black hole,” calculated Ashtekar. “But it does not become infinite. The quantum state of the 
universe is perfectly well-defined. One can study initial conditions at the big-bang and hope to 
analyze their ramifications for structure formation in the early universe.” 
 
The long-range consequence of this extension is described by Ashtekar and Bojowald with Jerzy 
Lewandowski of the University of Warsaw in the journal Advances in Theoretical and 
Mathematical Physics as follows: “The question of whether the universe had a beginning at a finite 
time is now ‘transcended’. At first, the answer seems to be ‘no’ in the sense that the quantum 
evolution does not stop at the big-bang. However, since space-time geometry ‘dissolves’ near the 
big-bang, there is no longer a notion of time, or of  ‘before’ or ‘after’ in the familiar sense. 
Therefore, strictly, the question is no longer meaningful. The paradigm has changed and meaningful 
questions must now be phrased differently, without using notions tied to classical space-times.” 
 
This discovery is credited to Bojowald’s equation, which is based on earlier work of Thomas 
Thiemann who was formerly also at the Max-Planck-Institute for gravitational physics and is 
currently a researcher in Canada with Lee Smolin. 
 
“Formulating the equation did not happen in a flash but rather took almost two years. Everything 
had to be extracted from the very complicated expressions of the full theory,” remembers Bojowald 
who was born in 1973 and graduated from the Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule,

Aachen, with a doctorate in physics. “At first I was looking for solutions of quantum geometry 
describing rotationally symmetric black holes. Symmetries usually simplify the equations, but this 
was not yet enough. Then I turned to cosmological models which are even simpler thanks to their 
homogeneity principle: at large scales the universe is very uniform. However, as a physical 
application I took this seriously only later since to my mind preceding work on quantum cosmology 
looked arbitrary.” 
 
In contrast to the traditional equation of quantum cosmology – the Wheeler-DeWitt equation – it 
does not have a continuous time evolution but a discrete one (see the appendix “Quantum 
cosmology for the curious”). The passage of time proceeds in steps, albeit very tiny steps. The 
Wheeler-DeWitt equation arises from it as an approximation for larger time intervals and space 
volumes. But on the Planck-scale in the big-bang, when our observable universe was not much 
more than a point, Bojowald’s equation supplies other new solutions that are physically realistic 
and contain no singularity. That is an enormous breakthrough. 
 
“There are two sides to the singularity problem,” says Bojowald. “First, energy densities become 
infinite – but this is prevented by quantum geometry as follows from work by Thomas Thiemann. 
More serious is the break-down of time evolution.” This problem has now been solved by 
Bojowald: “In the context of quantum geometry we can now explicitly study the evolution, and we 
see that it no longer breaks down. In a sense, we can calculate backwards to times ‘before’ the big-
bang, where ‘before’ is not to be confused with our usual understanding of time.” 
 
The big-bang in this picture corresponds to the minimal expansion of the universe. It amounts to 
only about 0.36 Planck-lengths, as Bojowald has calculated (a Planck- length is 10-35 meters). “The 
value is determined by the square root of the so-called Barbero-Immirzi parameter, which at first is 
a free parameter of the theory but can be fixed by black hole entropy calculations. This shows a 
relationship between the different computations.” This example also illustrates how theorists check 
their theories in the absence of observational data: the freedom from contradiction and self-
consistency are signs of superior quality. “It is a success that the value is close to the Planck- length. 
A priori, concrete calculations could have resulted in a value like, say, 1020 Planck- lengths, which 
would already be ruled out by accelerator experiments. There is, of course, still a lot of space 
between 0.36 and 1020, but cosmological models would already run into technical problems if it 
would be around 3 rather than 0.36. This gives rise to several consistency checks, which so far have 
all been passed.“ 
 
The minimum expansion marks the transition from an earlier phase of the universe. Which 
characteristics it had – whether it had a classical space-time at all and perhaps matter, or whether it 
was in a totally crazy quantum state – cannot be read off from the calculations yet. “Our hope is that 
one day we will be able to restrict the freedom further, for instance, by consistenc y conditions of 
quantum geometry or empirical data such as the cosmic background radiation,” Bojowald says. It is 
also not necessary for the precursor-universe to be collapsed as a whole, but rather it is sufficient 
that a collapsed black hole therein would contain the germ for our universe – and other black holes 
would bear accordingly different universes. Actually Lee Smolin had already speculated some years 
ago about such a cosmic genesis. Anyhow, if Martin Bojowald is right, the big-bang was only a 
transitional phase and not the beginning of everything.

Particularly bizarre is the inversion of space at the big-bang. “Space in a sense turns its inside out,” 
Bojowald says. “This can be visualized with an ideally spherical balloon which looses air. It 
remains an empty balloon such that all its parts clash together – as in a singularity. Now one has to 
imagine that instead of clashing the parts can freely move through each other and simply move 
forward. The balloon then again expands with the former inside pointing outward, and vice versa.” 
 
Bojowald’s extension has a big advantage in comparison with competing cosmological theories: it 
suffices to take the characteristics of the universe today as input for the equations and reckon 
backwards in time. Apart from the well-known natural constants, it is crucial to assume the 
common experience that nature does not change radically over short time scales. In this quantum 
cosmological beginning, the initial conditions of the universe become a part of the laws of nature 
and are thus no longer puzzling and unexplainable. 
 
“That there is no freedom to choose initial or boundary conditions is new to physics and has 
philosophical consequences,” says Bojowald. “Usually, dynamical laws are separate from and 
independent of boundary conditions. The new way of deriving such conditions comes from the 
direct picture we have of classical singularities and their replacement by quantum geometry. There 
is no need to introduce auxiliary constructions which most of the time are not phys ically sound and 
so dependent on one’s personal taste.” 
 
The inflation of the universe – its sudden, exponential swelling shortly after the big-bang – a model 
which is accepted by many cosmologists today, also has a place in quantum geometry. Bojowald: 
“You can even regard it as a prediction of quantum geometry. For the first time it could be derived 
from a theory of quantum gravity.” And even the postulate of the yet unknown inflaton- field is not 
necessary for driving the inflation. 
 
Certainly numerous details are still unsettled, and possibly the quantum geometrical inflation may 
not be sufficient to allow the universe to become large enough. But even if an additional inflaton-
field has to be assumed, its characteristics would be less special than in previous models and can be 
estimated using quantum geometry. This has observable consequences, as Roy Maartens of the 
University of Portsmouth and his colleagues Shinji Tsujikawa and Parampreet Singh have recently 
shown. It could explain even the measured temperature variations in the cosmic background 
radiation – the afterglow of the big-bang – better than other models. “Already now is it possible to 
test such models given by quantum geometry,” Bojowald is pleased – and adds a matching 
restriction: “With all that, of course, one has also be careful since there are no really decisive tests 
yet.” 
 
At the end of the inflationary period the universe heated up and matter was formed. All this already 
happened in the first fraction of a second, after the universe reached its minimum size. With the 
expansion of space, the spin network continued to grow. And just a few 100000 Planck-times later 
(a Planck-time is 10-43 seconds), the continuous fabric of classical space-time was formed. Indeed, 
the text on this page is wove n from the very same fabric: no less than 1068 quantum threads pass 
through this sheet of paper alone.

Appendix 

Quantum Cosmology for the Curious  
 
The whole world in one equation: formulas for a universal description 

 
In his preface to the best seller A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking worried that each formula 
in the book would halve the number of its readers. If this also applies to this text, please browse 
through it quickly – otherwise it promises to threaten the author with more hardships. For his naive 
impertinence caused him to be bold enough to offer a glimpse of the fundamental equations with 
which the quantum cosmologists try to describe nothing less than the origin and development of the 
entire universe – cosmic formulas par excellence indeed. 
 
In quantum cosmology, this happens by means of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Bryce DeWitt 
published it in 1967 in the journal Physical Reviews – based on initial work by physics professor 
John Archibald Wheeler at the University of Texas in Austin. It reads: Hy  = 0. 
 
That sounds short and crisp and can be easily printed on a T-shirt. In parties, such a T-shirt would 
provide material for conversation. But beware – probing questions are guaranteed! In order not to 
cause an embarrassing silence, it is worthwhile to delve into a few details. 
 
Hy  = 0 is the Hamiltonian constraint, a fundamental equation, with which the quantum-
cosmological theory of the universe is specified. A constraint equation describes the interaction of 
physical fields – for instance of the force of gravity and matter – by certain functions that are first 
considered independent from one another. It guarantees that, for example, a change of matter goes 
with a change in gravitation and vice versa. With  Hy  = 0 alone one cannot do much. It is crucial to 
solve the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. It can be derived from the Hamiltonian constraint equation as 
follows: 
 
-1/6 . lPl
 
That looks complicated and indeed it is. Therefore let us move very slowly step by step: 
 
• lPl is the Planck- length (10-35 meters)  
 
• a is the scale factor of the universe. It describes the variation in the size of space and can be used 
therefore also as a measure of  “internal time” of the universe. If space does not expand uniformly, 
but rather anisotropically – for example into one direction more quickly than in another – one must 
use different, direction dependent sizes a1, a2 etc. 
 
• y (a, f ) is the wave function of the universe – to a certain extent the universal extension of the 
Schrödinger-equation basic in quantum theory, applied now to the universe as a whole. y  depends 
on the scale factor a (the stroke ' in the equation stands for the mathematical derivative – it is 
therefore a differential equation) as well as on the nature of matter f .  
 

4 . ((a . y (a, f ))' . 1/a)' . 1/a + 3/2 . k . a . y (a, f ) = 8pG . Hf(a)y (a, f )

• The Hamiltonian operator H (named after the Scottish physicist and mathematician William 
Rowan Hamilton) is an especially tricky instrument used by physicists. In quantum physics it 
designates an energy operator, which plays a decisive role in the description of the dynamics and 
interaction of a quantum system. While in classical physics the energy can be calculated directly 
from the field values, in quantum physics it must be extracted from the wave function y . 
Mathematically this happens through the Hamiltonian operator, which one must apply, for example 
using derivatives, on the wave function.  
 
• Hf(a) is the Hamiltonian operator for matter. It contains the entire theory of matter, more exactly: 
the total energy of all matter fields. (The Hamiltonian operator could in principle also contain the 
matter description of string theory.) “Matter” is therefore a broad concept that includes not only all 
the well-known elementary particles as well as radiation  and gravitational waves, but also the 
ominous dark matter that does not interact electromagnetically, fields like the hypothetical inflaton 
that shaped the epoch of cosmic inflation, and the mysterious dark energy that accelerates the 
expansion of the universe. 
 
• k designates geometry or global curvature of space (0 = flat, +1 = positively curved like a sphere,  
-1 = negatively curved like a saddle). 
 
• G stands for Newton’s gravitational constant (6.6742 x 10-11 cubic meter per kilogram seconds 
square).  
 
If one sets a = 0, the differential equation becomes singular. This point corresponds to the classical 
big-bang singularity where space and time disappear and energy, matter density and temperature 
become infinite. The earlier attempts of quantum cosmologists – for instance of Bryce DeWitt, 
Stephen Hawking, Alexander Vilenkin and Andrei Linde – tried to select the initial conditions of 
the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, as it were, by hand or to extend the equation in such a way that the 
singularity disappears or the conditions for a = 0 do not become unphysical. But that seems 
artificial and cannot be established through more basic principles.  
 
From the perspective of quantum geometry, space and time in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation are still 
regarded as continuo us. When one gives up this condition, the world looks completely different – 
and the singularity problem disappears. This has far reaching consequences (see the main article). 
 
Martin Bojowald of the Max-Planck-Institute for gravitational physics in Potsdam succeeded in 
making this quantum cosmological breakthrough – a thrust into the time before the big-bang. It was 
achieved in the framework of quantum geometry, defusing the problems of the Wheeler-DeWitt 
equation by replacing it with a new equation. At the moment of the big-bang the equation leads to 
other solutions, but at later times it is in excellent agreement with the solutions of the Wheeler-
DeWitt equation – which is therefore still useful.  
 
Bojowald’s time development equation reads as follows: 
 
(V|n+4|/2 - V|n+4|/2 -1) . eik . yn+4(f ) - (2 + g2 k2) . (V|n|/2  - V|n|/2-1) . yn(f )  
+ (V|n-4|/2 - V|n-4|/2-1) . e-ik . yn-4(f ) = - 8p/3 . G . g3 . lPl
2 . Hf(n)yn(f )

• V is the volume of the universe and k again its geometry (here only applicable for 0 or +1). In this 
equation, the volume cannot approach zero as closely as desired, but rather is bounded by the 
Planck-length lPl. The minimal volume is: 
 
Vmin = (1/12(cid:214)2) . g . (cid:214)g . lPl
 
• i is the imaginary number, defined by  i2 = -1 
 
• e is Euler’s number (2.71828182845905), the basis for natural logarithm; additionally, it satisfies:  
eip = -1 
 
• g is the Barbero-Immirzi parameter. Named after the Spanish physicist Fernando Barbero and the 
Italian physicist Giorgio Immirzi this number indicates the discreteness of the area in quantum 
geometry in relation to the Planck scale, given by (cid:214)g . lPl = 0.36 lPl. This value was determined from 
the calculation of black hole entropy by Abhay Ashtekar, John Baez, Alejandro Corichi and Kirill 
Krasnov. 
 
• n is the crucial part of the equation: it is integer valued, and thus signifies jumps in the progress of 
time and replaces to a certain extent the scale factor. Negative values of  n designate the time before 
the big-bang, positive n the time after. The formula takes the absolute value of n in the formula for 
V, so that the volume of the universe is always positive. The volume is minimal with  n = -1 and n = 
1. (With n = 0 the wave function is decoupled and does not have a fixed value – it is still unclear 
what this means exactly). 
 
In contrast to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation Bojowald’s equation is not a differential equation but 
rather a difference equation. The reason for it is the discrete internal time structure. That means: 
The time n does not “flow” continuously (and thus does not have arbitrary values represented by 
real numbers), but rather runs in abrupt steps (represented by integers). It is similar to a movie film 
whose frames follow in such quick succession that our eyes believe and the brain recognizes it as 
one fluent movement – yet in reality it is a rapid sequence of single snapshots. Today – and already 
fractions of a second after the big-bang – the film of the universe runs in such a way that it can be 
described very well with classical or semi-classical physics (the Friedmann equation in general 
relativity and the Wheeler-DeWitt equation). The individual snapshots of the big-bang become 
recognizable only under the sharpened eye of quantum geometry.

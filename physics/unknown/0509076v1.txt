Abstract
We relate four-dimensional mass parameters to the positions of AdS 4-brane intersections in
six-dimensional  AdS  spacetime.  The  4-branes  wrap  1-cycles  on  the  rectangular  toroidal
orbifold T2/(Z2)3, are situated upon and parallel to the fixed lines, and intersect orthogonally
on  four-dimensional  Minkowski  junctions.  Particles  are  arranged  upon  the  line  equidistant
from the two extra dimensions. In four dimensions, the particles occupy a geometric sequence
of mass levels that descends from the Higgs field vacuum expectation value. Scales that we
identify with the three Standard Model families derive from the geometry of the orbifold and
stand  in  precise  relationship  to  the  GUT  scale  of  the  Minimal  Supersymmetric  Standard
Model.

1. Introduction
We begin by briefly reviewing the literature, in particular the brane-world models, that have
informed this work. Brane-world models exploit the geometry of extra dimensions to address
the hierarchy problem of the gulf in size between the Planck scale, ∼1019 GeV, and the weak
scale, ∼103 GeV [1-4]. In the Randall and Sundrum RS I model [3], an extra spatial dimension
is compactified on an S1/Z2 orbifold and the Standard Model particles and forces are confined
to a negative-tension 3-brane, the ‘visible’ brane, separated from a positive-tension 3-brane,
the Planck or ‘hidden’ brane, by a slice of five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime (AdS5).

where ηµν is the Minkowski metric of four-dimensional spacetime, k is the AdS curvature and
y  is  the  coordinate  of  the  extra  dimension.  The  exponential  factor  is  the  source  of  the
hierarchy between the Planck and weak scales; it  results  from  the  small  overlap  in  the  fifth
dimension of the graviton wave function with our ‘visible’ 3-brane. In the RS II model [4],
the negative tension brane is moved off to infinity; the visible brane is at y = 0. On the basis
of the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) conjecture [5, 6], the coordinate y
can  be  thought  of  as  parametrizing  the  four-dimensional  scale  [7].  Two  field  excitations  at
scales related by a transformation factor e-λ in four-dimensional spacetime correspond to two
excitations centred on positions related by a translation y → y + λ/k in the fifth dimension. We
shall  make  use  of  this  correspondence  when  relating  four-dimensional  scales,  and  particle
masses, 
to  positions  within  an  extra  dimension.  The  AdS/CFT  conjecture  relates
compactifications  on  AdS  spacetimes  of  ten-dimensional  string  theories,  and  eleven-
dimensional M-theory [8, 9], to conformal field theories in various dimensions.

Lykken  and  Randall  have  combined  the  results  of  RS  I  and  II  to  address  the  hierarchy
problem  in  an  infinite  extra  dimension  with  positive  tension  branes  only  [10].  Gravity  is

2

localized  on  the  Planck  brane  and  we  live  on  a  separate  brane  in  the  fifth  dimension,  upon
which mass scales are exponentially suppressed. Oda has shown how gravity can be trapped
on multiple D3-branes, with positive tension, situated at intervals along the extra dimension
[11]. It was later shown that fields of all spins (≤2) can be localized on positive tension branes
[12].

Supersymmetric  versions  of  the  Standard  Model  have  been  constructed  with  an  extra
dimension compactified on S1/Z2 [13] or S1/(Z2 × Z2′) [14, 15]. Orbifold compactifications are
used  to  break  the  symmetries  of  the  higher  dimensional  theory  and  produce  a  four-
dimensional effective theory [16, 17].

In an extension of the Randall and Sundrum RS II model [4], by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos,
Dvali and Kaloper (ADDK) [18], n orthogonal (2+n)-branes intersect on 3 spatial dimensions
in  AdS4+n  spacetime,  and  gravity  is  localized  to  the  intersection,  where  the  Standard  Model
fields  reside.  The  bulk  comprises  2n  identical  patches  of  AdS4+n.  In  the  six-dimensional
theory, our world (a 3-brane) is located at the intersection of two, or more, 4-branes, so long
as  the  tensions  acting  on  the  junction  balance  [19,  20].  With  the  Gauss-Bonnet  term  in  the
bulk action, the tension on the intersection of two orthogonal 4-branes can be nonzero [21].
Nelson’s work generalizes the ADDK solution in an AdS6 spacetime containing intersecting
4-branes  upon  which  the  induced  metric  is  AdS  [20].  The  branes  intersect  on  four-
dimensional Minkowski junctions (3-branes) with localized gravity.

Following  the  observation  that  intersecting  D-branes  can  give  rise  to  chiral  fermions  [22],
models incorporating intersecting branes in string theory vacua have been widely studied in
recent years; see [23, 24] for reviews. In the intersecting D-branes scenario, the gauge fields
of  the  Standard  Model  are  localized  on  D-branes  wrapping  compact  cycles  of  an  internal
space.  The  pattern  of  intersections  governs  the  spectrum  of  the  chiral  fermions.  Toroidal
models incorporate D4, D5 or D6-branes wrapping 1, 2 or 3-cycles of T2, T4 (factorized as T2
× T2) or T6 (factorized as T2 × T2 × T2), respectively. The D-branes wrap 1-cycles in each T2.
Wrapping numbers ni and mi specify the number of times each fundamental 1-cycle of the T2
is wrapped. Different D-branes wrap different (ni, mi) cycles and can intersect more than once
on the torus to generate a multiplicity of particle families. Toroidal orbifold models can offer
more scope for model building. In theories with two extra dimensions, T2/Z2, T2/Z3, T2/Z6 and
T2/(Z2 × Z2′) are frequently used [13]. Supersymmetric SU(6) models have been constructed
with two extra dimensions compactified on T2/(Z2)3 and T2/(Z2)4 [25].

In this paper, we relate particle masses to the positions of intersecting AdS 4-branes in AdS6
spacetime.  The  branes  lie  upon  and  parallel  to  orbifold  fixed  lines  and  intersect  on  four-
dimensional  Minkowski  junctions.  In  Section  2,  we  describe  the  set-up,  in  which  4-branes
wrap 1-cycles on a rectangular T2/(Z2)3 orbifold that is identified with S1/Z2 × S1/(Z2 × Z2′).
The radius of each S1 is equal to the inverse of the AdS curvature and is of Planck scale. Four-
dimensional  mass  parameters  are  related  to  the  positions  of  fixed  points  within  the  T2/(Z2)3
orbifold. In Section 3, we show that the weak gauge bosons W± and Z0, the mesons and the
charged leptons are distributed upon the orbifold fixed lines perpendicular to one of the extra
dimensions, of coordinate y, and upon sub-lines of 2n-fold symmetry between the fixed lines.
In  Section  4,  we  show  that  the  quarks  are  distributed  upon  the  orbifold  fixed  lines
perpendicular  to  the  other  extra  dimension,  of  coordinate  z,  and  that  the  baryons  are
distributed upon sub-lines of 2n-fold symmetry between the fixed lines. The mass differences
of  various  hadrons  in  the  SU(3)  representations  will  be  shown  to  correspond  precisely  to
positions on orbifold fixed lines. In Section 5, we show that the quark doublets u–d, s–c and
b–t are associated with fixed line and sub-line intersections. The intersections lie on the line y
=  z  in  a  symmetrical  arrangement;  in  four  dimensions,  the  corresponding  sequence  of
fundamental scales includes the standard GUT scale of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM). We provide evidence that all particles lie on the line y = z, where they form

symmetrical  arrangements.  In  four  dimensions,  particles  of  all  kinds  occupy  a  geometric
sequence  of  mass  levels  that  descends  from  the  Higgs  field  vacuum  expectation  value.  In
Section 6, we discuss our findings.

Unless  stated  otherwise,  all  values  of  particle  mass  to  which  reference  is  made  have  been
taken from the Particle Data Group (PDG) listings for 2005 [26]. We use the values of PDG
fits. Where such values are not given we use PDG averages.

Throughout the paper, for conciseness, we will refer to K± and other particle/antiparticle pairs
as single particles.

2. The model
We work on six-dimensional Anti-de Sitter spacetime, in which 4-branes wrap 1-cycles on a
rectangular  orbifold  T2/(Z2)3,  which  is  identical  to  S1/Z2  ×  S1/(Z2  ×  Z2′)  [25].  Each  S1  is  of
radius  1/k,  where  k  is  the  AdS  curvature.  The  induced  metric  on  the  4-branes  is  AdS,  as  in
[20].  The  4-branes  lie  parallel  to  the  orbifold  fixed  lines  and  intersect  orthogonally  on  3-
branes upon which the induced metric is four-dimensional Minkowski. The 3-branes are the
domains of particles. The fifth dimension, of coordinate y, is a periodic extension of the long
side of the orbifold. The sixth dimension, of coordinate z, is a periodic extension of the short
side of the orbifold. The bulk metric is reflection symmetric about the line y = z. We relate
mass parameters to positions in the two extra dimensions on the basis of the correspondence
between scale in four-dimensional spacetime and position in a warped extra dimension [7].

First, we consider the relative sizes of the Planck scale M of the higher dimensional theory,
the four-dimensional Planck scale MP and the AdS curvature k. In the RS II model [4], with
its infinite extra dimension, the scales are related by

To  fulfil  this  requirement  we  conjecture  that  M  =  MP  =  k.  Next,  we  consider  a  scale
transformation in four dimensions, from the Planck length, 1/MP = 1/k, to the length scale π/k
of the S1/Z2 orbifold. The corresponding translation in the fifth dimension is from y = 0, the
position of the Planck brane, to y = (1/k)lnπ, the position of the fixed point across the  long
side  of  the  fundamental  rectangle  of  the  T2/(Z2)3  orbifold.  In  our  semi-infinite  extra
dimension, fixed points are positioned at

where  n1  takes  the  values  0,  1,  2,  3…..  The  warp  factor 
mass parameters are rescaled according to position in the fifth dimension, is given by

We now consider a scale transformation in four dimensions, from the Planck length, 1/MP =
1/k, to the length scale (π/2)/k of the S1/(Z2 × Z2′) orbifold. The corresponding translation in
the  sixth  dimension  is  from  y  =  0,  the  position  of  the  Planck  brane,  to  y  =  (1/k)ln(π/2),  the
position of the fixed point across the short side of the fundamental rectangle of the T2/(Z2)3
orbifold.  A  (second)  geometric  sequence  of  mass  parameters  in  four  dimensions  (Planck
Sequence 2) corresponds to a lattice of fixed points in the semi-infinite sixth dimension. The

The numbers n1 and n2 refer to the wrapping of 1-cycles on the T2/(Z2)3 orbifold by 4-branes
that lie parallel to the long and short sides of the rectangle, respectively. They represent the
numbers of times the orbifold is wrapped up to the positions of brane intersections. Fractional
values  of  n1  and  n2  parametrize  fractionally  wrapped  branes.  Fractionally  wrapped  branes
feature in several models, including [28-30].

In Sections 3 and 4, we present values of n1 and n2 for the particles of the Standard Model,
superimposed upon mass levels that can be viewed as graphical representations of the fixed
lines that are perpendicular to the fifth and sixth dimensions.

3. Planck Sequence 1
We  show  that  the  mesons,  charged  leptons  and  weak  gauge  bosons  W±  and  Z0  occupy  the
mass levels, and sub-levels as defined below, of a geometric sequence (Planck Sequence 1),
of  common  ratio  π-1,  that  we  have  identified  with  the  positions  of  fixed  points  in  the  fifth
th term in
dimension. Defining the 0th term in Planck Sequence 1 as the Planck Mass MP, the n1
the sequence has a value given by (5).

The  occupation  of  Planck  Sequence  1  by  the  lightest  charged  lepton  (electron),  the  lightest
flavoured mesons (K± and K0) and the weak gauge bosons W± and Z0 is shown in figure 1.
The electron occupies a  0th  order  (integer  n1)  level.  The  K±–K0  isospin  doublets  lie  on  a  0th
order mass level. W± and Z0 form a ‘mass-doublet’ on a 1st order (half-integer n1) level. Mass-
doublets  are  symmetrical  configurations  of  particles  about  a  mass  level  (fixed  line  or  sub-
line). A mass sequence of common ratio π-3 appears to overlay the fundamental sequence.

Most mesons, and the muon and tau lepton, occupy ‘higher order’ mass levels, for which n1 =
a.2-b  where  a  and  b  are  positive  integers;  b  is  the  order  of  the  level.  The  occupation  of  the
mass  levels  of  Planck  Sequence  1  by  low  mass  strange  and  charmed  mesons,  and  states  of
predominantly  ss  and  cc  composition, is shown in figure 2. K*± and K*0 occupy levels of 7th
and  8th  order,  respectively.  η′  occupies  a  7th  order  level,  while  φ  occupies  a  3rd  order  level.
The  charmed  mesons  D0,  D±,  D*0  and  D*±  are  associated  with  two  5th  order  levels.  ηc
occupies a 4th order level, while J/Ψ occupies a level of 5th order. Ψ(2S) occupies a 2nd order
level.

Uncertainties in n1 arising from measurement errors and from uncertainty in the Planck Mass
are small compared with the level spacing. For levels of 4th order in Planck Sequence 1, the
level spacing is 0.07 of the level mass. For levels of 8th order, the level spacing is 0.004 of the
level mass.

The lowest mass unflavoured states are also found upon the mass levels of Planck Sequence
1. π0, of mass 134.98 MeV, and π±, of mass 139.57 MeV, form a mass multiplet on a 3rd order
level,  of  mass  137.58  MeV.  η,  of  mass  547.75  ±  0.12  MeV,  occupies  an  8th  order  level,  of

5

mass 547.79 MeV. ρ, of mass 775.8 ± 0.5 MeV (neutral only, e+e-), and ω, of mass 782.65 ±
0.12 MeV, appear to form a mass-multiplet on a 6th order level, of mass 779.89 MeV.

The muon, of mass 105.66 MeV, occupies an 8th order level in Planck Sequence 1, of mass
105.67 MeV. The tau lepton occupies a higher order level. These two charged leptons occupy
low order levels in another mass sequence, as will be shown in Section 5.

4. Planck Sequence 2
We  now  provide  evidence  that  the  quarks  occupy  the  mass  levels  of  a  geometric  sequence
(Planck  Sequence  2),  of  common  ratio  (π/2)-1,  that  we  have  identified  with  the  positions  of
fixed  points  in  the  sixth  dimension,  and  that  the  baryons  occupy  sub-levels  of  Planck
th term
Sequence 2. Defining the 0th term in Planck Sequence 2 as the Planck Mass MP, the n2
in the sequence has a value given by (6).

As  measures  of  quark  mass,  we  use  the  mid-range  values  of  the  Particle  Data  Group’s
evaluations, 2003 [31], shown in table 1. The model was constructed using these evaluations.
The 2005 evaluations differ slightly [26].

of  174.3  ±  5.1  GeV  results  from  direct  observations  of  top  events.  The  top  quark  running
mass, 
  =  165  ±  5  GeV  [31],  has  been  used  in  the  analysis  for  consistency  with  the
other values of quark running mass.

The baryons are found to lie upon higher order mass levels in Planck Sequence 2. Here, we
show the occupation of mass levels by isospin singlet states of each flavour and by low mass

unflavoured and flavoured baryons. Values of n2 for the I(JP) = 0(½+) baryons, Λ (uds), Λc
0 appear to occupy 1st order
(udc), Λb
0 occupies a 3rd order level. Λ (uds, I=0) forms  a symmetrical  mass-doublet
levels, while Ωc
with Σ0 (uds, I=1), centred on Level 97. The mass difference, 76.959 ± 0.023 MeV, of these
two strange baryons corresponds to a value of n2, in (5), of 103.001 ± 0.003. In other words,
the mass difference is equal to the mass of a 0th order level. Precise 0th order mass differences
also occur between Σ baryons and other S=1 light hadrons, as will be shown later in this
section.  The  lowest  mass  unflavoured,  strange  and  charmed  baryons  are  associated  with  7th
and  lower  order  mass  levels.  Values  of  n2  for  these  baryons  are  presented  in  figure  5.  The
proton-neutron isospin doublet forms a mass-doublet on a 7th order level. The ∆(1232) states
are  centred  upon  a  6th  order  level,  of  mass  1232.1  MeV.  We  saw  in  figure  4  that  Λ  and  Σ0
form a mass-doublet on a 0th order level; in figure 5, Σ+ and Σ- are shown to occupy 6th order
+  lies  close  to  a  1st  order  level,  as  was  shown  in  figure  4,  but
levels.  The  singlet  state,  Λc
occupies a 7th order level.

Uncertainties in n2 arising from measurement errors and from uncertainty in the Planck Mass
(0.007%)  are  small  compared  with  the  level  spacing.  For  levels  of  3rd  order  in  Planck
Sequence  2,  the  level  spacing  is  0.06  of  the  level  mass;  for  levels  of  7th  order,  the  level
spacing is 0.004 of the level mass.

Values  of  mass  difference  between  Σ  baryons  and  other  S=1  hadrons  of  the  SU(3)
multiplets equal the masses of 0th order levels in Planck Sequence 2. As we have stated, the
mass difference of the uds baryons, Λ (I = 0) and Σ0 (I = 1), equals the mass of a 0th order
level (n2 = 103) in Planck Sequence 2. The mass difference of Σ0 and Σ(1385)0 is 191.1 ± 1.0
MeV, for which n2 = 100.99 ± 0.01. Σ+ (uus) and Σ- (dds) differ in mass by 8.08 ± 0.08 MeV,
for which n2 = 107.99  ± 0.02. The value of  n2 corresponding to the mass difference of K*±
( su ) and Σ0 (uds) equals 99.98, while the value of n2 corresponding to the mass difference of
K*0 ( sd ) and Σ0 equals 100.01. The quark content of  K*±  is  given  as  that of  the  positively
charged meson. The two values of mass difference closely straddle a 0th order level. Values of
n2 corresponding to strange hadron mass differences, and to the mass of the strange quark, are
presented in figure 6. Those mass differences featuring strange hadrons differing in isospin or
spin, or both, are described below, in terms of the strange quark mass ms of the model:

to the mass difference of φ and Ξ0 equals 100.02, while the value of n2 corresponding to the

5. On the line y = z
We show that scales identified with the three families of the Standard Model correspond to
three positions within the extra-dimensional space where low order fixed lines of the T2/(Z2)3
orbifold  coincide  to  high  precision  at  y  =  z.  Then  we  provide  evidence  that  all  particles
occupy positions on the line y = z.

The u–d quark mass-doublet is centred on a mass level in Planck Sequence 2 for which n2 =
109 (see figure 3). The value of n1 corresponding to the mass of this level is 42.9992. For all
values of mass,

which has the value 2.53493. The quotient of the two prime numbers 109 and 43, the values
of n2 and n1 associated with the u-d mass-doublet, is 2.53488. The fraction 109/43 is closer in
value  to  lnπ[ln(π/2)]-1  than  any  other  fraction  constructed  from  integers  in  the  range  1  to
1000,  other  than  those  formed  from  multiples  of  109  and  43.  Since  the  fraction  38/15
(2.53333) is also close in value to lnπ[ln(π/2)]-1, low (0th to 2nd) order mass levels in Planck
Sequence 1 and Planck Sequence 2 coincide on the line y = z where n1 = 43 and n2 = 109, n1 =
43 – 15/4 = 39.25 and n2 = 109 – 38/4 = 99.5, and n1 = 43 – 15/2 = 35.5 and n2 = 109 – 38/2 =
90.  In  Planck  Sequence  2,  the  quark  mass-doublets  are  centred  on  levels  (fixed  lines)  for
which n2 takes the values 109, 99.5 and 90 (see figure 3). We conclude that the three quark
mass-doublets,  and  thereby  families  of  the  Standard  Model,  are  associated  with  three
positions on the line y = z, up to which orthogonal 1-cycles of the T2/(Z2)3 orbifold are either
fully wrapped or fractionally wrapped, the fraction being a half-integer or quarter-integer.

Various  prominent  hadrons  and  hadron  mass-doublets  are  also  associated  with  low  order
levels in Planck Sequence 1 and Planck Sequence 2, suggesting that they also lie on the line y
=  z.  Consider  the  strange  hadron  pairs,  K±-K0  and  Λ-Σ0  of  the  SU(3)  representations.  The
meson pair K±-K0 is associated with a 0th order level in Planck Sequence 1, as shown in figure
1, and a 3rd order level in Planck Sequence 2. The baryon pair Λ-Σ0 forms a mass-doublet on a
0th  order  level  in  Planck  Sequence  2,  as  shown  in  figure  4,  and  a  3rd  order  level  in  Planck
Sequence  1.  The  weak  gauge  boson  pair  W±–Z0  is  also  associated  with  low  order  levels  in
both Planck sequences. The two gauge bosons were shown in figure 1 to form a mass-doublet
on a 1st order level in Planck Sequence 1. They also form a mass-doublet on a 1st order level
in Planck Sequence 2. We can also identify singlet states that occupy low order levels in both
0  occupies  a  1st  order  level  in
Planck  Sequence  1  and  Planck  Sequence  2.  The  baryon  Λb
Planck  Sequence  2,  as  shown  in  figure  4,  and  a  3rd  order  level  in  Planck  Sequence  1.  The
vector meson resonance φ occupies a 3rd order level in Planck Sequence 1, as shown in figure
2, and a 5th order level in Planck Sequence 2. Many other particles appear to occupy higher
order levels in both Planck Sequence 1 and Planck Sequence 2, suggesting that all particles lie
on the line y = z.

We  have  seen  that  the  lowest  mass  particles  with  specific  quantum  numbers,  e.g.  I(JP)  =
0(½+), occupy low order levels in their respective sequences. Now we see, in figure 7, that on
the  line  y  =  z,  the  lowest  mass  baryon  (proton),  the  lowest  mass  charged  meson  (π±),  the

lowest  mass  charged  lepton  (electron)  and  the  quark  pairs  form  a  symmetrical  arrangement
that  incorporates  the  Higgs  field  vacuum  expectation  value  (VEV).  Each  quark  pair  is
represented in figure 7 by the wrapping numbers (n1, n2) associated with the mass-doublet. In
the  Standard  Model,  the  quark  and  lepton  masses  are  generated  through  couplings  with  the
Higgs field. The mass of fermion f is given by mf = cfv, where cf is a dimensionless coupling
-1/2 is the Higgs field VEV, equal to 246.22 GeV [27]. We now show
constant and v = 2-1/4GF
that, on the line y = z, particles in general (weak gauge bosons, quarks, hadrons and leptons)
occupy  positions  related  to  that  corresponding  to  the  Higgs  field  VEV.  The  corresponding
‘Higgs Sequence’ of particle masses descends from the Higgs field VEV with common ratio
rH = (π/2)-5 and contains its own higher order levels. Level numbers in the Higgs Sequence
are  denoted  by  nH.  The  occupation  of  the  mass  levels  of  the  Higgs  Sequence  by  the  vector
boson  W±,  the  strange  and  charm  quarks  of  Planck  Sequence  2,  the  lowest  mass  strange
mesons and baryons, and the lowest mass mesons and baryons constructed from strange and
charm quarks, is shown in figure 8. Of the hadrons, strange, ‘charmed, strange’ and neutral
vector states occupy the lowest order levels. The occupation of the Higgs Sequence by neutral
vector  states  is  considered  separately.  W±  occupies  a  1st  order  mass  level  (nH  =  0.5)  in  the
Higgs Sequence. The strange and charm quarks of Planck Sequence 2 occupy 3rd order mass
levels. The lightest strange meson, K±, forms a mass-doublet with its isospin partner, K0, on a
2nd order level. The lightest charmed, strange meson, Ds
± (J=0), forms a mass-doublet with its
spin  partner,  Ds*±  (J=1),  on  a  3rd  order  level,  the  two  mesons  occupying  mass  levels  of  6th
order. The lightest strange baryon, Λ (uds, I=0), forms a mass-doublet with Σ0 (uds, I=1) on a
0  (ssc)
3rd  order  level,  the  two  baryons  occupying  mass  levels  of  6th  order.  The  baryon  Ωc
occupies a 0th order mass level. Finally, the elusive exotic baryon θ+ (
uudd ) occupies a 2nd
order level in the Higgs Sequence. θ+ occupies a third order level in Planck Sequence 2. The
values of nH and n2 associated with θ+ are 2.249 ± 0.001 and 96.374 ± 0.003, respectively.

s

The neutral vector boson, Z0, and the unflavoured neutral vector meson resonances, J/Ψ ( cc )
and Y ( bb ) occupy mass levels of 4th order in the Higgs Sequence, as shown in figure 9. The
neutral vector meson, Bs*0 ( bs ) occupies a level of 4th order between the levels occupied by
J/Ψ and Y. The SU(3) octet-singlet mixed neutral vector states, ω and φ, occupy higher order
levels as shown. Relative to the mass of the Z0 boson, φ, J/Ψ and Y occupy 0th and 1st order
levels in a geometric sequence, the Z0 Sequence, of common ratio (π/2)-5, as shown in figure
10. In this arrangement, Bs*0 occupies a level of 2nd order. The tau lepton is included in the Z0
Sequence  since  it  supplements  the  symmetry  in  level  occupation,  occupying  a  level  of  2nd
order between the levels occupied by φ and J/Ψ. Within the small experimental uncertainty,
the  mass  of  the  tau  lepton  (1776.99  +0.29/-0.26  MeV)  equals  the  geometric  mean  of  the
masses of φ and J/Ψ (1776.85 ± 0.03 MeV):

The  muon  occupies  a  0th  order  level  within  the  Z0  Sequence  and,  like  the  tau  lepton,
supplements the symmetry in vector meson level occupation. The masses of the two leptons
are related through the equation

to  within  the  small  experimental  uncertainty.  The  presence  of  charged  leptons  in  a  vector
sequence presumably reflects their nature in the higher dimensional theory.

There  is  also  evidence  for  a  pseudoscalar  sequence  within  the  Higgs  Sequence.  The
unflavoured neutral pseudoscalar mesons of the SU(4) 20-plet occupy the sub-levels of an ad
hoc bottom-up sequence defined by the mass of the lightest pseudoscalar meson, π0. Relative

9

to the mass of π0, the states η, η′ and ηc occupy levels of 3rd order in a geometric sequence of
0 ( bs ) also
common ratio (π/2)5, as shown in figure 11. The neutral pseudoscalar meson, Bs
occupies  a  3rd  order  level  in  the  arrangement.  The  Particle  Data  Group  [25]  notes  one
observation  of  ηb,  of  mass  9300  ±  20  ±  20  MeV,  although  this  observation  needs  to  be
confirmed.  The  corresponding  value  of  [nH  –  nH(π0)]  is  –1.875  ±  0.002.  In  other  words,  ηb
might also occupy a 3rd order level in the pseudoscalar sequence.

Finally,  we  touch  on  the  question  of  gauge  coupling  unification  in  an  intersecting  brane
three  generation
world.  Blumenhagen,  Lust  and  Stieberger  [33]  have  shown 
supersymmetric intersecting brane world models can lead to gauge coupling unification at a
scale close to the standard GUT scale of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, 2 ×
1016  GeV.  In  figure  7,  we  saw  that  the  three  families  of  the  Standard  Model  are  associated
with  three  4-brane  intersections  on  the  line  y  =  z,  at  scales  related  by  powers  of  a  factor
(π/2)9.5.  This  sequence  of  fundamental  scales  includes  the  GUT  scale.  The  scale  associated
with the wrapping numbers (5.5, 14) is 2.2 × 1016 GeV.

6. Discussion
The matter content of our world arises at 4-brane intersections in AdS6 spacetime. The mass
of a particle in four dimensions depends on its distance from the Planck brane in either extra
dimension, since particles are situated upon a line equidistant from the two extra dimensions.
We  can  relate  the  same  phenomena  to  the  geometry  of  both  AdS6  and  AdS5  spacetimes.  In
AdS6, 4-branes wrap 1-cycles of the orbifold T2/(Z2)3 = S1/Z2 × S1/(Z2 × Z2′), and intersect on
3-branes, which are the domains of particles. The scales of the Standard Model families relate
to  the  GUT  scale  of  the  MSSM  and  derive  from  the  geometry  of  the  T2/(Z2)3  orbifold.  In
AdS5,  3-branes  occupy  positions  in  an  extra  dimension  that  is  compactified  on  the  orbifold
S1/(Z2  ×  Z2′).  In  the  latter  model,  the  mass  of  a  particle  in  four  dimensions  depends  on  its
distance from the Higgs brane in the sixth dimension.

We  have  shown  that  the  values  of  couplings  with  the  Higgs  field  have  a  geometrical
interpretation  within  the  model.  However,  the  value  of  the  Higgs  Sequence  common  ratio,
(π/2)-5,  remains  a  puzzle.  Five  wrappings  of  a  1-cycle  parallel  to  the  sixth  dimension
correspond to 1.97 wrappings of a 1-cycle parallel to the fifth dimension, so perhaps the value
(π/2)-5 results from almost coincidental integer wrappings of the T2/(Z2)3 orbifold.

Some  hadron  mass  differences  appear  to  depend  on  differences  in  the  quantum  numbers  of
the  related  particles.  Equations  (7-11)  show  that  some  mass  differences  can  be  related  to
differences in I or J.

The  particles  participating  in  a  mass-doublet,  in  the  Planck  sequences  and  the  Higgs
Sequence,  differ  from  each  other  with  respect  to  charge,  spin,  isospin  or  isospin  projection.
Some  mass-doublets  might  arise  as  a  consequence  of  D-brane  splitting.  The  splitting  of
branes that wrap parallel cycles can occur in toroidal orbifolds because of the non-rigid nature
of the cycles [34].

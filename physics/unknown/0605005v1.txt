A novel overlap histogramming method based on Dual-Topology Hamiltonian-Replica- 

Exchange simulation technique is presented to efficiently calculate relative free energy 

difference in rough energy landscape, in which multiple conformers coexist and are 

separated by large energy barriers. The proposed method is based on the realization that 

both DT-HREM exchange efficiency and confidence of free energy determination in 

overlap histogramming method depend on the same criteria: neighboring states’ energy 

derivative distribution overlap. In this paper, we demonstrate this new methodology by 

calculating free energy difference between amino acids: Leucine and Asparagine, which 

is an identified chanlleging system for free energy simulations. 

PACS Codes: 

Calculating  relative  free  energy  difference  has  been  one  of  major  subjects  in 

computational  biophysics.  It  can  help  us  to  quantitatively  understand  solvation,  drug 

binding,  and  protein-protein  interaction  etc.  at  atomistic  level  [1].  Accuracy,  efficiency 

and  robustness  are  the  most  concerned  issues  in  the  development  of  free  energy 

simulation  techniques  [1].  Commonly,  free  energy  simulations  are  performed  in  the 

framework  of  equilibrium  thermodynamics.  For  instance,  in  “alchemical”  free  energy 

perturbation  (FEP)    [2]  and  thermodynamics  integration  (TI)  [3]  techniques,  energy 

potentials of two states are connected by scaling parameter, λ (usually linearly). Slowly 

switching  λ  (including  long  time  relaxation  at  each  fixed  λ  value)  allows  reversible 

transformations between two states, as shown below:

Traditional  FEP  and  TI  methods  have  been  proved  to  be  valuable  and  served 

computational  communities  a  great  deal  [1].  However,  their  shortcomings  in  the  issues 

mentioned  above  are  becoming  obvious,  especially  after  exhaustive  applications  [1,4]. 

Recently, improvement in free energy simulation techniques has been mostly emphasized 

in efficiency issues [4,5]. It is especially motivated by the proposals of non-equilibrium 

free  energy  simulation  theories,  such  as  Jarzynsky  formulism  [6]  and  overlap 

histogramming  method  [7]  (or  sometimes  called  “fluctuation  theorem”  or  “Crooks 

theorem” [8]). 

 

In non-equilibrium free energy simulations, scaling parameter λ can be switched 

in  fast  manner,  from  ensembles  of  starting  state  A  to  targeting  state  B  in  the  forward 

direction  or  from  ensembles  of  targeting  state  B  to  starting  state  A  in  the  reverse 

direction.  Following  the  tradition  [7],  we  can  label  the  work  (W)  distribution  in  the 

forward direction as 

(Wf

)

 and backward direction as 

(Wg

)

. These two distributions can 

be  utilized  to  obtain  relative  free  energy  difference 

A∆   through  the  following 

relationship:

(2) 

This relationship is called “overlap histogramming”. In this method, determination of the 

intersection  point  between  two  distributions  allows  obtaining  relative  free  energy 

difference  of  two  states,  because  when 

WgWf

W ∆=

.  Confidence  of 

determining  the  intersection  point  relies  on  how  well  these  two  distributions  overlap. 

Usually,  biomolecular  systems  have  multiple  conformers  separated  by  possibly  large 

energy barrier, which can prevent an effective exploration of the configurational space. 

So conformational sampling is another issue to be concerned about, in order to improve 

free energy simulation efficiency and accuracy, especially in rough energy landscape [9]. 

Here,  we  introduce  an  efficient  method,  which  can  solve  these  two  problems 

simultaneously in a robust manner. In the present method, scaling parameter λ serves two 

purposes both as effective temperature label (for the purpose of enhancing sampling) and 

 

 

2

potential  energy  scaling  parameter  (to  improve  the  confidence  in  determining  the 

intersection point). The present development is based on Hamiltonian Replica Exchange 

Method (HREM) [10]; it is a variant of more often used Temperature Replica Exchange 

Method (TREM) [11] by replacing the random walk in temperature with one through an 

ensemble of models with scaled (or partially scaled) energy function: 

UU
=

U
λ+

S

. In 

E

HREM, sampling in the portion where potential is scaled, can be very efficient, due to the 

reason  that  rate-limiting  energy  barrier  crossing  can  be  facilitated  by  exchanging 

structures with simulations on low λ energy functions. Here, λ can be considered as the 

label  of  local  “effective  temperature”  [12].  HREM  method  is  particularly  useful  in 

simulating  local  events  in  biomolecular  systems,  such  as  ligand  binding  or  local 

conformational  change,  because  of  its  flexibility  in  treating  local  potentials  without 

destructing global structural integrity. This treatment can also help to improve exchange 

rate  [10].  In  our  HREM  simulation,  switching  potential  function  for  free  energy 

simulations shown in Eq. 1 can be rewritten as

in which part of system incorporating the unique portion of starting state is scaled by (1-

λ)  and  the  other  one  incorporating  the  unique  portion  of  targeting  state  is  scaled  by  λ. 

Scaled  portions  have  independent  coordinates  X   and 

'X ,  and  so  at  two  end  points, 

original starting state and targeting state energy functions can be obtained. Different from 

regular  HREM,  the  present  method,  named  by  us,  “Dual-Topology  HREM”  (DT-

HREM),  has  two  parts  representing  two  end  states,  scaled  in  the  reverse  directions, 

independently  by  λ  and  (1-λ).  Here,  λ  and  (1-λ)  become  labels  of  local  effective 

temperatures  besides  original  roles  as  potential  scaling  parameters  in  alchemical  free 

energy simulations. N noninteracting copies of the molecule simulated on Dual-Topology 

potentials with a series of λ values (λ1 = 0 <  λ2 <  λ3 … <  λN = 1), shown in Eq. 3, are 

exchanged according to

is also the difference of energy derivatives

. So exchange frequency 

U

λλλ =

is  determined  by  the  overlap  of  energy  derivative  distributions  at  ensembles 

( iλΓ

)

and 

(
jλΓ

)

. Because of this exchange move, all the energy landscapes in  X  and 

'X  portion 

in an ensemble models with various λ values can be explored efficiently, provided that 

sampling of  X  and 

'X  is aided independently by high-λ end and low-λ end simulations 

respectively.  This  is  due  to  the  reason  that  at  each  of  two  ends  of  scaling  parameters, 

energy barriers for one of states are scaled down to help all the copies with λ values near 

the other ends “tunnels” through energy barriers. And so at each λ simulation, ensemble 

)(λΓ

 for its corresponding potential (Eq. 3) can be generated efficiently.  

For  two  ensembles  generated  in  DT-HREM 

( iλΓ

)

  and 

(
jλΓ

)

,  free  energy 

difference  ∆Aij  in  between  them  can  be  calculated  by  applying  Eq.  2.  Considering 

instantaneous move between these two states, forward work and backward work should 

be energy difference ∆Uij (between λ=λj and λ=λi potentials), on the structures in 

( iλΓ

)

 

(forward) and 

(
jλΓ

)

 (backward) ensembles respectively. Since ∆U is equal to 

times 

∂U
λ∂

∆λij, confidence of determining intersection of two work (

∆λij) distributions should 

∂U
λ∂

depend  on  the  overlap  of  energy  derivative  distributions  as  replica  exchange  frequency 

does.  So  in  the  present  “Dual-Topology  Hamiltonian-Replica-Exchange  Overlap 

Histogramming Method”, configurational space sampling problem and work distribution 

function overlap problem can be solved simultaneously, because they are regulated by the 

 

4

same criteria. Since states with smaller λ difference tend to have better energy derivative 

distribution  overlap,  ∆AAB  can  be  computed  as  the  sum  of  free  energy  differences 

between several neighboring states connecting two end states:

As  shown  later,  with  the  increasing  of  number  of  copies  N  and  neighboring  energy 

derivative  distribution  overlap  becoming  larger,  free  energy  convergence  also  becomes 

faster both due to more efficient conformational sampling and more confident free energy 

determination. 

 

In  biomolecular  researches,  chemical  modifications  are  often  made,  such  as 

mutating  residues  in  protein  binding  sites  or  changing  binding  ligands;  this  may  very 

possibly  lead  to  local  conformational  rearrangements  [1].  The  present  method  is 

especially suitable for relative binding affinity calculations in these systems. To illustrate 

the present method, alchemical free energy simulation between amino acids asparagines 

(ASN) and leucine (LEU) is taken as the model system. As shown in reference 9, both 

asparagines  and  leucine  have  multiple  conformations  related  to  sidechain  χ1  and  χ2 

angles  and  these  conformations  are  separated  by  high  energy  barriers  into  various 

minimum  regions.  For  the  reason  that  global  minima  of  ASN  and  LEU  are  located  in 

different regions, correct free energy difference cannot be easily obtained by regular free 

energy  simulation  technique,  such  as  TI.  This  can  occur  because  global  minimum 

structure of starting state is evolved to be one of local minimum structures of ending state 

with λ switching if no special treatment is applied. 

 

In the setup of DT-HREM simulation (Figure 1a), ASN and LEU share the same 

amino  acid  backbone  structure  (neutrally  blocked)  with 

its 

internal  potential 

corresponding  to  part  of  UE  in  Eq.  3.  Scaled  energy  potential  terms  (Van  der  Waals, 

Coulomb  and  Torsional  terms)  determining  ASN  and  LEU  sidechain  conformations 

correspond  to 

( XU A
S

)

  and 

( XU B
S

)'

  in  Eq.  3  respectively;  unscaled  energy  potential 

terms (Bond and Angle terms) of amino acid sidechain portions are also part of UE. So at 

 

5

one  of  two  end  points,  we  have  one  of  amino  acids’  energy  potentials  together  with 

harmonic energy terms of the other state’s side chain. Because free energy change due to 

harmonic  energy  terms  is  separable  from  that  caused  by  the  rest  of  system  [13],  the 

contributions from the harmonic energy terms of the other state can be cleanly cancelled 

when computing the change of free energy difference in two environments, for instance, 

from gas phase to solution for solvation free energy difference of these two amino acids, 

or  from  solution  to  protein  for  their  binding  free  energy  difference.  Unscaled 

environment  energy  terms  in  UE  can  keep  certain  structural  integrity  and  facilitate  the 

increase of exchange frequency at the end points (λ = 0 for 

( XU B
S

)

 or λ = 1 for 

( XU A
S

)

) 

by 

increasing  energy  derivative  distribution  overlap  between  neighboring  state 

ensembles.  This  is  one  of  identified  advantages  of  HREM  methods  [10].  If  applied  in 

protein systems, solution part and most of protein can be treated by unscaled environment 

term UE, and conformation-determining energy terms (such as Van der Waals, Coulomb 

and  Torsional  terms)  at  mutation  site  and  its  local  neighborhood,  which  may  undergo 

conformational  change  upon  mutation,  should  be  duplicated  and  scaled  in  the  way 

described  in  Eq.  3.  Choice  of  scaled  portion  in  the  setup  of  DT-HREM  simulation  is 

important to balance enhanced sampling efficiency and accuracy, which will be discussed 

later. 

 

All the calculations were carried out in the customized version of BLOCK module 

in CHARMM program [14]. In the present work, most of simulations were run at λ = 0, 

0.1, 0.2 0.45, 0.55, 0.8, 0.9, 1 with 8 CPUs. In comparison, one simulation was run at λ = 

0, 0.4, 0.6, 1 with 4 CPUs. In all calculations, a time step of 1 fs was used. The mass of 

the  solute  hydrogen  atoms  was  set  to  10  amu.  To  control  the  temperature,  we  used 
Langevin dynamics with a friction coefficient of 60 ps−1 acting on all nonhydrogen atoms 

and  random  forces  corresponding  to  the  target  temperature  of  300  K.    For  DT-HREM 

simulations, exchange frequency was set as one per 100 timestep. To obtain free energy 

difference  between  states 

( iλΓ

)

  and 

(
jλΓ

)

,  “universal”  probability  density  function 

(UPDF)  was  utilized  to  fit  work  distribution  functions 

(
ijWf

)

  and 

(
ijWg

)

.  And  then 

intersection of two curves (by Nanda & Woolf etc. in ref 5), which should be free energy 

difference of these two states based on Equation 2, was determined.

As discussed above, for each pair of scale parameters λi and λj, forward work and 

backward work Wij is equal to ∆λij times energy derivative 

U
∂
λλλ =
∂

i

and 

U
∂
∂
λλλ =

at two λ 

runs.  So  the  value  at  the  intersection  of  two  energy  derivative  distribution  functions 

scaled  by  ∆λij  should  be  equal  to  free  energy  difference 

ijA∆ .  Energy  derivative 

distribution functions for λ = 0, 0.1, 0.45, 0.9, 1 from 8 CPU run are shown in Figure 2. 

Obviously, choosing only five λ values is enough to guarantee good overlap in between 

neighboring distributions covering the λ range from 0 to 1, which as discussed above is 

the  criteria  of  both  confident  determination  of  free  energy  and  efficient  sampling.  In 

replica exchange simulations, usually a short preliminary run is carried out to determine 

optima set of temperatures or λ values. The purpose of the present work is to demonstrate 

how to efficiently compute free energy difference using DT-HREM; so λ values have not 

been on-purpose optimized. As shown (green line) in Fig. 3, free energy results obtained 

by DT-HREM overlap histogramming method converge at 300 ps with the value –61.7 

kcal/mol and are robustly stable afterwards. This value is quantitatively consistent with 

what  is  obtained  (-61.7  kcal/mol)  by  the  study  of  Boresch  etc.  using  adaptive  umbrella 

sampling  TI  approach  with  much  longer  simulation  time  (about  150  ns)  [9].  As 

comparison  (red  line  in  Fig.  3),  when  eight  regular  molecular  dynamics  simulations  on 

the  same  sets  of  λ-scaled  potentials  with  no  replica  exchange  were  run,  -59.7  kcal/mol 

was  stably  obtained  after  long  time  simulation.  This  value  is  consistent  with  one  of 

incorrect values obtained in the study by Boresch etc. Apparently without the mechanism 

of replica exchange, sampling can not be efficient and one of the end states is trapped in 

local  minimium.  Theoretically,  in  the  framework  of  DT-HREM,  increasing  work 

distribution  overlap  between  neighboring  runs  brings  nearly  100%  synergy  to  two 

traditionally orthogonal problems, work distribution intersection point determination and 

configurational  sampling  in  free  energy  simulations.  Usually,  improving  efficiency  in 

either  aspect  requires  a  great  deal  of  efforts.  When  we  reduce  number  of  replicas,  as 

shown (cyan line) in Fig. 3, 4-CPU run has much slower free energy convergence with 

free  energy  value  approaching  -60.5  kcal/mol  after  1  ns  simulation.  This  is  apparently 

 

7

due to the reduction of neighboring runs’ energy derivative distribution overlap with the 

number of replicas decreased. 

Figure 4. shows the conformation distributions of ASN and LEU along χ1 and χ2 

at  eight  different  λ  runs.  At  high  λ  region,  ASN  conformations  along  both  χ1  and  χ2 

directions are distinctly separate by high energy barriers. Barrier crossing is facilitated by 

exchange mechanism of DT-HREM simulation with low λ region conformations, which 

are more equally distributed. In a reverse way, at low λ region, LEU conformations along 

both  χ1  and  χ2  directions  are  distinctly  separate  by  high  energy  barriers  and  barrier 

crossing is facilitated by exchange mechanism of HREM simulation with high λ region 

conformations.  

The  illustration  in  Figure  4  also  indicates  the  importance  of  choosing  energy 

terms  to  be  scaled;  energy  terms  (Van  der  Waals,  electrostatic,  torsional  terms) 

determining both χ1 and χ2 related conformations in the present model system should be 

scaled by λ or 1-λ in order to explore energy landscape efficiently. Theoretically, all the 

energy  terms  can  be  scaled  in  DT-HREM  method.  However,  increasing  the  number  of 

scaled  energy  terms  will  likely  decrease  the  overlap  of  work  distribution  function 

between neighboring λ runs and so lower free energy simulation efficiency; especially at 

high effective temperature regime such as high λ region for ASN and lower λ region for 

LEU, structural integrity will be more likely to be destroyed when too many energy terms 

are scaled. For instance, in the present model, even if extra angle terms related to χ1 and 

χ2 angles are scaled in 

( XU A
S

)

 and 

( XU B
S

)'

, free energy calculation will converge much 

more slowly as shown by blue line in Figure 3. On the other hand, if we duplicate dual-

topology  copies  at  Cβ  atom  as  shown  in  Figure  1b,  although  exchange  frequency  is 

increased, free energy convergence is slower than when energy terms related to both of 

angles are scaled, as shown in magenta line of Figure 3, because conformation along χ1 

can not be explored efficiently. 

As discussed above, based on the hybrid form of regular HREM simulation and 

classical  form  of  “alchemical”  path  in  free  energy  simulation  [15],  DT-HREM  is 

 

 

8

developed  by  the  realization  that  in  DT-HREM,  both  replica  exchange  efficiency  and 

work distribution intersection determination confidence rely on the same criteria: energy 

derivative distribution overlap between two neighboring states labeled by two λ values. 

By inserting more intermediate states between starting state and targeting state, two key 

problems in free energy simulation, especially in rough energy landscape, can be solved 

simultaneously.  We  summarize  all  the  results  obtained  on  free  energy  difference 

(ASN→LEU)  calculations  using  different  setups  in  Figure  3.  In  terms  of  its  efficiency 

and  reliability,  the  comparison  in  Figure  3  clearly  demonstrates  the  power  of  the 

presented  “DT-HREM”  overlap  histogramming  method,  especially  in  the  systems  with 

rough energy landscapes. Due to the nature of scaling local energy terms in DT-HREM 

method rather than heating up the whole system unselectively like in temperature replica 

exchange  method,  this  technique  also  makes  free  energy  simulations  of  local  events  in 

large  systems  such  as  ligand  binding  and  chemical  mutation  robust.  Currently,  we  are 

applying  this  method  in  broad  range  of  drug  binding  and  protein-protein  binding 

problems.  Due  to  its  efficiency,  accuracy  and  robustness,  we  believe,  this  method  will 

contribute to computational biophysical applications a great deal.

Figure 1. Setups for DT-HREM simulations on the “alchemical” transformation from 
Leucine to Asparagine. a) Leucine and Asparagine share neutrally blocked amino acid 
backbone; b) Leucine and Asparagine share both amino acid backbone and Cα atom, in 
which χ1 can not be sampled efficiently. 

Figure 2. Energy derivative distributions for various ensembles on different λ scaled 
potentials (λ = 0, 0.1, 0.45, 0.9, 1). Red line shows the result fitted by “universal” 
probability density function (UPDF). 

Figure 3. Time evolution of computed free energy difference between Leucine and 
Asparagine with various DT-HREM overlap histogramming setups. If there is no special 
note, simulations were run with 8-CPU setup Red line: overlap histogramming result with 
no replica exchange allowed; Cyan line: DT-HREM overlap histogramming result with 
4-CPU run; blue line: DT-HREM overlap histogramming result with additional angle 
terms scaled; magenta line: DT-HREM overlap hisogramming result with χ1 bond shared 
by two amino acids. 

Figure 4. Conformation distributions of Leucine and Asparagine along χ1 and χ2 angles 
in various ensembles on different λ scaled potentials. These conformational distributions 
were obtained in DT-HREM simulations.

This article reports on an investigation  of student understanding of the concept of 
time in special relativity.  A series of research tasks are discussed that illustrate, 
step-by-step,  how  student  reasoning  of  fundamental  concepts  of  relativity  was 
probed.  The results indicate that after standard instruction students at all academic 
levels have serious difficulties with the relativity of simultaneity and with the role 
of  observers  in  inertial  reference  frames.    Evidence  is  presented  that  suggests 
many  students  construct  a  conceptual  framework  in  which the ideas of absolute 
simultaneity and the relativity of simultaneity harmoniously co-exist. 

 

I.  INTRODUCTION

There  is  growing  national  interest  in

topics,  such  as  relativity.    Proponents  of 
enlarging  the  scope  of  the  curriculum  argue 
that  in  the  beginning  of  the  21st century the 
content of introductory classes should reflect 
some of the major intellectual breakthroughs 
of the 20th century.  Others hold that the list 
of topics  that must be covered is already too 
daunting.    Physics  education  research  can 
play  a  pivotal  role  in  this  debate.    Whether 
students  first  encounter  modern  physics 
concepts  at  the  introductory  level  or  in 
advanced  courses,  it  is  important  to  identify 
what  students  can  and  cannot  do  after 
instruction  and  what  steps  can  be  taken  to 
help  deepen 
the 
material.    In  addition,  analyzing  the  ways  in

This  article  reports  on  an  investigation 
of  student  understanding  of  time  in  special 
relativity.    A  major  purpose  is  to  identify 
and 
the 
and 
reasoning  difficulties  that  students  at  all 
levels  encounter  in  their  study  of  special 
relativity.    The  emphasis  is  on  the  relativity 
of  simultaneity  and  the  role  of  reference 
frames.    We  found  that,  after  instruction, 
many  students  are  unable  to  determine  the 
time at which an event occurs, recognize the 
equivalence  of  observers  at  rest  relative  to 
one  another,  and  apply  the  definition  of 
simultaneity. 
  We  illustrate  the  process 
through  which  we  gradually  obtained  a 
detailed  picture  of  student  thinking  by  the 
design and successive refinement of a set of 
research tasks. 

II.  PRIOR RESEARCH 

There  is  currently  only  a  small  body  of 
research  on 
student  understanding  of 
relativity,  mostly  in  Galilean  contexts  (in 
particular,  relative  motion).    In  many  cases, 
the research tasks used (e.g., multiple-choice 
questions  or  single  questions  given  to  a 
small number of students) do not provide the 
kinds  of  insights  that  are  necessary  to 
understand  the  prevalent  modes  of  student

results from relevant investigations. 
Galilean relativity 

Investigations of physics undergraduates 
in  India  have  identified  the  belief  that 
reference  frames  have 
limited  physical 
extent.  Studies by Panse et al. and Ramadas 
et al. suggest that, for many students, frames 
of  reference  have  limited  physical  extent.  
Students  claim  that  a  body  can  “emerge” 
from  the  reference  frame  of  an  object  by 
leaving  the  vicinity  of  the  obje ct  (e.g.,  “a 
to  ‘go  outside’  a 
ball  can  be

Malgrange  has  identified  difficulties  with 
relative  motion  among  eleven-year-old-
children  and  first- and fourth-year university 
students  in  France.5    The  three  groups 
showed  little  difference  in  error  rates  to 
written questions.  Many students tended to 
identify an object’s motion as intrinsic, not a 
quantity  that  is  measured  relative  to  a 
reference frame.  Students tended to make a 
distinction  between  “real”  motion,  which 
has  a  dynamical  cause,  and  “apparent” 
motion,  which  is  “an  optical  illusion,  devoid 
of any physical reality.”

of  special  relativity.7    The  student  in  the

location.9    Her  preliminary  results  provided 
impetus  for  the  investigation  detailed  in  this

The construct of a reference frame is at 
the heart of relative motion.  Most courses in 
special  relativity  begin  with  a  discussion  of 
a reference frame as a system of observers 
(or  devices)  by  which  the  positions  and 
times 
determined.

relating  measurements  made  by  different 
observers.  The concept of a reference frame 
presupposes an understanding of more basic 
measurement procedures.  For clarity in the 
discussion that follows, we review the basic 
operational 
associated  with 
reference frames,  i.e.,  the  determination  of 
the  position  and  time  of  an  event  and  the 
conditions  under  which  two  events  are 
treated as simultaneous.10

relativity 

An  event 

is 
associated  with  a  single  location  in  space 
and a single instant in time.  The position of 
an event is defined to be the coordinate label 
on  a  rigid  ruler  at  the  location  of  the  event.   
The ruler is envisioned to extend indefinitely 
from  some  chosen  origin.11  The  time of an 
event  is  most  naturally  defined  as  the 
reading  on  a  clock  located  at  the  event’s 
position  at  the  instant  at  which  the  event 
occurs.    The  rulers  and  clocks  used  by  any 
observer are at rest relative to the observer. 
All  observers  in  special  relativity  are 
assumed  to  be  “intelligent  observers” who 
use  synchronized  clocks.    To  determine  the 
time of a distant event, an observer corrects 
for  the  travel  time  of  a  signal  originating  at 
the  event.12,13    Inertial  observers  at  rest 
relative  to  one  another  determine  the  same 
positions  and  times  for  events  (and  hence 
the same relative ordering of events).  Such 

observers  are  said  to  be  in  the  same 
reference frame.14 

Events are defined to be simultaneous in 
a  given  frame  if  their  corresponding  time 
readings  are  identical,  according  to  the 
definition  of  the  time  of  an  event  discussed 
above.    A  judgment  of  the  simultaneity  of 
widely separated events necessarily includes 
an  appropriate  definition  of  the  time  of  a 
distant event.15  The invariance of the speed 
of  light  has  an  inevitable  and  unsettling 
implication. 
  Two  events  at  different 
locations  that  occur  at  the  same  time  in  a 
given  frame  are  not  simultaneous  in  any 
other frame.

The  relativity  of  simultaneity  is  among 
the  key  results  of  special  relativity  and  one 
that  is  particularly  difficult  to  grasp,  as 
evidenced by the numerous “paradoxes” that 
arise from it.  It is not reasonable to expect

intricacies of the counterintuitive results that 
follow  from  the  operational  definition  of 
simultaneity.  In this study, we considered a 
meaningful  understanding  of 
relativistic 
simultaneity  to  include  the  ability  to  identify 
relevant  events,  to  determine  the  time  at 
which  an  event  occurs  (by  correcting  for 
signal  travel  time),  and  to recognize that the 
time  interval  between  two  events  is  not 
invariant  but  depends  on  the  reference 
frame.  Other aspects of student ideas about 
time and reference frames are not discussed 
(e.g.,  synchronization  of  clocks  in  relative 
motion,  spatial  measurements,  differences 
between inertial and non-inertial frames). 

IV. OVERVIEW OF THE RESEARCH 

This  investigation  was  conducted  over 
the  last  five  years  at  the  University  of 
Washington and at two other large research 
universities.    Fourteen  instructors  at  the 
University  of  Washington  and  one  faculty 
member  at  each  of  the  other  universities 
have cooperated with the Physics Education 
Group in this study.

C.  Research tasks 
To  obtain  an 

increasingly  deeper 
understanding  of  how  students  apply  the 
concepts  of  simultaneity  and  reference 
frame,  we  used  variants  of  three  questions:   
the  Spacecraft question (four versions), the 
Explosions  question,  and  the  Seismologist 
question.    All  involve  two  observers  with  a 
given  relative  motion.    Students are told the 
time ordering of the events for one observer 
and  asked  about  the  time  ordering  of  the 
events  for  the  second  observer.19    These 
questions  and  their  solutions  are  described 
below.

A correct answer to all versions can be 
obtained  by  qualitative  or  quantitative 
reasoning or from a spacetime diagram.  The 
following  is  an  example  of  a  qualitative 
argument  that  we  would  have  accepted  as 
correct.22  In the spacecraft frame, light from 
the  two  eruptions  moves  outward  at  the 
speed  of  light  in  spherical  wavefronts  from 
two points that are stationary.  In that frame, 
the  observer  on  the  ground,  who  receives 
both  signals  simultaneously, 
is  moving 
backward  (i.e.,  in  the  direction  of  an  arrow 
pointing  from  the  front  of  the  spacecraft 
toward 
the 
spacecraft  observer, 
the  ground-based 
observer is closer to the center of the signal 
from Mt. Rainier at the instant that observer 
receives  both  signals.

2.  Explosions question 
The Explosions question is the converse 
of the Spacecraft question.  Students are told 
that two events occur at different times in a 
given frame and are asked if there is another 
frame in which the events are simultaneous. 
In the  Explosions question, an explosion 
occurs  at  each  end  of  a  landing  strip  with 
proper length of 3000 m.  In the frame of an 
engineer at rest on the strip, the explosion at 
the  right  end  occurs  a  time  c  dt = 1200 m 
after the explosion on the left end.  (In some 
variations,  students  were  given  a  time  of 
dt = (1200 m)/c  =  4  ms.    The  conversion 
seemed  to  present  no  difficulty.)    Students 
are asked whether there is a frame in which 
the explosions are simultaneous, and if so, to 
determine the relative velocity of that frame. 
A correct answer can be found through 
use  of  the  Lorentz  transformations.24    The 
spatial  separation  between  the  explosions 
(dx)  is  3000 m  and  the  time  separation  (c 
dt) is  1200 m. 
  Thus  the  time  duration 
between  the  explosions  (c  dt´)  is  zero  in  a 
frame  that  moves  from  left  to  right  with 
speed 0.4c. 

3.  Seismologist question 
The  Seismologist  question  probes 
student  understanding  of  reference  frames 
and  simultaneity  within  a  single  reference 
frame.    The  context  is  similar  to  that  of  the 

-

two  volcanoes, 
Spacecraft  question: 
Mt. Rainier  and  Mt. Hood,  suddenly  erupt 
and  a  seismologist  at  rest  midway  between 
them sees the eruptions at the same instant.  
The  Seismologist  question  differs  from  the 
Spacecraft  question  in  that  the  second 
observer (the “assistant”) is not moving, but 
remains  at  rest  relative  to  the  ground  at  the 
base  of  Mt. Rainier.    Students  are  asked 
whether  Mt. Rainier  erupts  before,  after,  or 
at  the  same  instant  as  Mt. Hood  in  the 
reference frame of the assistant. 

To  answer  the  Seismologist  question 
correctly, students must be able to apply the 
definition of simultaneity and understand the 
role  of  a  reference  frame  in  establishing  a 
common  time  coordinate  for  observers  at 
rest  relative  to  one  another.    Since  the 
seismologist  and  the  assistant  are  in  the 
same reference frame, they obtain the same 
answer for the order of the eruptions.  Since 
the  seismologist  is  equidistant  from  the 
mountains,  the  signal  travel  times  are  the 
same.    Therefore, the eruptions occurred at 
the 
time 
the  same 
seismologist and the assistant.

in 

At  each  stage  of  our  study,  we  tried  to 
determine  whether  student  responses  truly 
reflected their understanding of the material.  
For  instance,  we  wanted  to  determine  the 
extent  to  which  specific  difficulties  are 
linguistic  or  conceptual  and  the  extent  to 
which mistaken beliefs are easily addressed 
or  deeply  held.    To  this  end,  we  continually 
refined  the  research  tasks.    Results  from 
earlier  tasks  guided  us  in  designing  new 
questions  that  would  enable  us  to  probe 
student thinking more thoroughly.

understanding of special relativity was based 
on two versions of the  Spacecraft question:  
an undirected and a  directed version.  The 
two  versions  and  the  results  from  each  are

question,  students  are  asked  explicitly 
whether,  in  the  reference  frame  of  the 
spacecraft,  Mt. Rainier erupts before, after, 
or at the same time as Mt. Hood.  They are 
also  asked  to  find  the  time  between  the

thought  the  observer’s  location  affects  the 
time  ordering  of  the  events.    By  describing 
the  eruptions  as  events,  we  tried  to  make 
clear  to  students  that  the  time  interval  of 
interest is not that between the reception of 
the light signals by the moving observer, but 
rather  that  between  the  emission  of  the 
signals by the volcanoes.

In the third (location-specific) version of 
the  Spacecraft  question,  students  are  told 
that  the  spacecraft,  which  is  flying  from 
Mt. Rainier to Mt. Hood, is over Mt. Rainier 
at  the  instant  Mt. Rainier  erupts.    The 
eruption  events,  which  are  simultaneous  in 
the  ground  frame,  are  explicitly  labeled  as

(Mt. Hood  erupts).

The  failure  to  distinguish  between  the

observer  sees  that  event  occurring  did  not 
seem to be a superficial error but seemed to 
have  deep  roots.    Many  students  failed  to 
recognize that an observer is not isolated but 
has  access  to  information  provided  by  other 
observers in his or her frame. 

“For  example  if  he  looks  at  [the 
volcano, it] looks peaceful.  There 
is  nothing  going  on.    So  he  would 
say it hasn’t erupted.  I would say,

you  have  to  have  any  evidence,

The difficulties seem to be intimately tied to

As  described  earlier,  we  found  that 
many  students  fail  to  apply  spontaneously 
the  idea  of  relativity  of  simultaneity  after 
instruction.    On  the  other  hand,  we  also 
found  that  many  students  appear  to  believe 
in a type of relativity of simultaneity that we 
would term excessive.  Students often claim 
locations 
that  observers 
determine different time orderings for events 
based  on  the  reception  of  signals  from  the 
events.  We now present evidence that these

We wanted to ensure that students were

of

In this problem, all events and motions occur along a single line in space.  Non-inertial effects on the 
surface of the Earth may be neglected.   

Two volcanoes, Mt. Rainier and Mt. Hood, are 300 km apart in their rest frame.  Each erupts suddenly in 
a burst of light.  A seismologist at rest in a laboratory midway between the volcanoes receives the light 
signals from the volcanoes at the same time.  The seismologist’s assistant is at rest in a lab at the base of 
Mt. Rainier.   

Define Event 1 to be “Mt. Rainier erupts,” and Event 2 to be “Mt. Hood erupts.” 

A fast spacecraft flies past Mt. Rainier toward Mt. Hood with constant velocity v = 0.8c relative to the 
ground (g = 5/3).  At the instant Mt. Rainier erupts, the spacecraft is directly above it and so the 
spacecraft pilot receives the light from Mt. Rainier instantaneously. 

All observers are intelligent observers, i.e., they correct for signal travel time to determine the time of 
events in their reference frame.  Each observer has synchronized clocks with all other observers in his or 
her reference frame. 

For each intelligent observer below, does Event 1 occur before, after, or at the same time as Event 2?

1.  Tendency to regard the relativity 
of  simultaneity  as  an  artifact  of 
signal travel time 

During  the  interview,  many  students 
seemed  to  resist  thinking  about  simultaneity 

in  terms  of  emission,  rather  than  reception, 
of the signals.  As the interviews progressed, 
we  realized  that  part  of  the  difficulty  was 
that  they  believed  strongly  that,  in  every 
reference frame, the two events occurred at 
the same instant.  Many seemed to treat the 
non-simultaneity  of  the  reception  of  the 
signals  as  a  way  of  reconciling  this  belief 
with  what  they  thought  they  had  learned 
about the relativity of simultaneity.

conceptual difficulties with reference frames 
and  the  time  of  an  event  can  prevent 
students  from  interpreting  appropriately  the 

terms  in  the  Lorentz  transformations.    In 
particular,  many  students  appeared 
to 
believe  that  the  Lorentz  transformations 
constitute a correction for signal travel time: 

S:  In the reference frame of the 
spacecraft,  does  Event  1 
occur  before,  after,  or  at  the 
same  time  as  Event  2?    … 
Before.    Even  though  the 
spacecraft  is  traveling  very 
fast,  I  would  say  that  it’s 
right  next  to  Mt. Rainier  so 
it’s  going  to  see  Mt. Rainier 
go  off,  and  even  though  it’s 
traveling  towards  Mt. Hood 
and  the  light  from  Mt. Hood 
is  traveling  towards  it,  it  will 
still  take  some  amount  of 
time  for  the  information  of

(advanced

The  “desynchronization  term”  in  the 
Lorentz  transformation  for  time  (–  vdx/c2) 
presented  particular  difficulty  for  students.28  
Several cited that term in support of the idea 
that the time of an event is influenced by the 
position of an observer relative to the event: 

“[This  term]  is  the  correction  for 
the  travel  time  of  the  light.    The 
time I have to wait in my frame to 
see  one  event  and  then  the  next 
one.” (graduate student) 

The  student  above  went  on  to  express 
his confusion about the fact that the term is 
proportional to the speed of the spacecraft.

signal from Hood is reduced as the speed of 
the  spacecraft  in  the  ground  frame  is 
increased. 

3.  Tendency to treat simultaneity as 
independent of relative motion 

Some  students  stated  explicitly 

that 
is  not  directly 
relativity  of  simultaneity 
related  to  relative  motion.    Even  graduate 
students  expressed  this  idea.    As  in  the 
preliminary 
investigation,  some  students 
appeared to believe that relative motion does 
play  a  role  in  the  timing  of  events  in  the 
spacecraft frame – but only to the extent that 
it  influences  the  reception  of  signals  by  the 
spacecraft. 
Commentary 

We  have  found  that  students  often 
incorporate the relativity of simultaneity into 
their  own  conceptual  framework  in  a  way 
that  allows  them  to  continue  to  believe  in 
absolute  simultaneity. 
  They  do  so  by 
treating the time of an event as the instant at 
which  that  event  is  seen  to  occur  by  an 
observer  and  attributing  the  relativity  of 
simultaneity  to  signal  travel  time.    Such 
incorrect  beliefs  can  insulate  students  from 
gaining  an  understanding  of  the  relativity of 
simultaneity  as  a  consequence  of 
the 
invariance of the speed of light.  Instructors 
and  textbooks  often  admonish  students  to 
distinguish  between  the  corrections  of  a 
finite  signal  travel  time  and  the  inevitability

C.  Belief that every observer constitutes 

a distinct reference frame  
The  Spacecraft question discussed thus 
far  had  originally  been  designed  to  probe 
student  understanding  of  simultaneity.    The 
results  suggested, however, that we needed 
their 
to 
understanding  of  reference  frames.    We 
therefore developed other questions to probe 
student  beliefs  about  simultaneity,  reference 
frames,  and  the  role  of  observers.    Results 
from  two  of  these, the  Explosions question 

investigate  more 

deeply 

and the  Seismologist question, are described 
below. 

Explosions question 

In the  Explosions question, students are 
given  the  time  interval  between  two  non-
simultaneous events in one frame and asked 
whether there is second frame in  which the 
events are simultaneous.  As in the first two 
versions  of  the  Spacecraft  question,  no 
mention is made of a specific observer in the 
second  frame.    However,  students  often 
raised  the  issue  of  the  observer  location 
spontaneously.

course 

The  question  has  been given in written 
form  to  introductory  students  in  sophomore 
modern physics courses and to students in a 
junior-level 
in 
magnetism.  In both cases, the question was 
administered  on  an  examination  after 
instruction  in  special  relativity.    We  have 
also  asked  the  Explosions  question  during 
interviews  with  5  advanced  undergraduate 
and 12 graduate students.

The percentage of correct responses on 
the  written  question  was  40%.    In  the 
interviews, 3 of the 5 undergraduates and 7 
of 
the  12  graduate  students  answered 
correctly.  Many students attempted to solve 
the  questions  mathematically  and  it  was 
often  difficult  to  characterize  their  errors.  
However,  the  responses  of  students  at  all

constraint  on  the  solution  by  specifying  a

traveling  at  0.4c,  and  must  be  at 
the  point  where  the  engineer  is 
standing.”  (introductory student  – 
italics added for emphasis) 

The  student  seems  to  believe  that  the 
explosions  are  simultaneous  only  for  one 
observer in the ‘moving’ frame (the observer 
who  sees  them  simultaneously).    Another 
introductory student answered similarly.

but there is a position.  We can be 
[a certain number of] meters from

The  student  seems  to  have  interpreted 
the  question  “Is  there  a  frame  in  which  the 
events are simultaneous?” to mean “Is there 
an observer who sees the events at the same 
time?”  This student apparently believes that 
a  set  of  observers  at  rest  relative  to  one 
another  would  not  agree  that  the  explosions 
are simultaneous since such observers would 
not all receive light from the two explosions 
at the same instant.  The student was unable 
to  apply  the  idea  of  a  reference  frame  as  a 
system for measuring the time of events. 

Seismologist question 

In  the  Seismologist  question,  students 
are asked about the relative ordering of two 
events for a seismologist and an assistant at 
rest  relative  to  one  another.    The  question 
was  designed  to  probe  whether  students 
would 
treat  simultaneity  as 
relative, even for two observers in the same 
reference frame.

they 

In  the  view  of  the  student  above,  “the 
reference frame of the assistant” consists of 
a  single  observer  (the  assistant).    Many 
students treated a reference frame as being 
local to the position of an observer.30 

In  one  version  of  the  Seismologist 
question,  students  are  asked  explicitly  about 
both  (1)  the  order  in  which  the  light  signals 
from  the  eruptions  reach  the  assistant  and 
(2)  the  order  of  the  eruption  events  in  the 
reference  frame  of  the  assistant.    In  their 
responses,  some  students  stated  explicitly 
that the questions were identical. 

“If  by  his  reference  frame,  you 
mean,  ‘When  did  he  see  it?’  it 
would be before.” 

Despite the fact that both observers are 
in  the  same  frame,  some  students  referred 
explicitly  to  the  relativity  of  simultaneity or 
to the lack of synchronization of clocks.

assistant’s frame according to the

The belief that each observer constitutes 
a separate reference frame was common and 
seems  to  be  quite  strongly  held.    The 
dialogue below provides an example. 

S:  The assistant is at Mt. Rainier, 
and  Mt. Rainier  erupts,  and 
Mt. Hood  erupts  at  the  same 
time.    But  he  can’t  see  it  the 
same  time,  because  if  you

Unlike 

some  of 

introductory 
students, nearly all of the advanced students 
distinguished  clearly  between  emission 
events  (the  eruptions)  and  reception  events 
(the arrival of the light from an eruption at a 
particular  observer).    They  also  recognized 
that  the  travel  time  of  light  is  relevant.  
However,  nearly  all  of 
these  students 
indicated a belief that such corrections were 
not  appropriate  for  observers  to  make  in 
attempting to determine the time of an event 
in  their  reference  frames. 
  During  the 
interviews,  many  expressed  the  view  that

“reference 
observer  perceives  at  a  particular  location.   
One  student  went  so  far  as  to  express  the 
belief  that  the  time  ordering  of  events in an 
observer’s  frame  depends  on  which  signals 
that observer is able to detect: 

“Within  normal  human  ability  to 
comprehend time, I would say that 
the eruptions are going to be at the 
same time.  But if he’s blind, he’s 
going  to hear  Rainier  for  sure go 
off  before  Hood.    And  so  he’s 
going to say that Rainier went off 
before Hood because it’s going to 
take  much  longer  for  the  sound 
from Hood to get there.” (graduate

The  student  quoted  above  was  also 
asked to sketch pictures of the explosions as 
they  happen  in  the  seismologists’  reference 
frame. 
“Which 
seismologist?    The  one  at  the  base  of  the 
mountain, or the one in the middle?”  At the 
interviewer’s  cautious  response  of  “Both,” 
she  sketched  two  sets  of  pictures  – one for 
the  seismologist  in  the  middle,  and  one  for 
the  assistant  at  Mt. Rainier.    [See  Fig.  4.]  
She  explicitly  indicated  that  the  eruptions 
were

identified 
widespread  difficulties  that  students  have 
with  the  definition  of  the  time  of  an  event 
and  the  role  of  intelligent  observers.    After 
instruction,  more 
than  2/3  of  physics 
undergraduates and 1/3 of graduate students 
in  physics  are  unable  to  apply  the  construct 
of a reference frame in determining whether 
or  not  two  events  are  simultaneous.    Many 
students  interpret  the  phrase  “relativity  of 
simultaneity” 
the 
simultaneity  of  events  is  determined  by  an 
observer  on  the  basis  of  the  reception  of 
light  signals. 
  They  often  attribute  the 
relativity  of simultaneity to the difference in 
signal travel time for different observers.  In 
this  way,  they  reconcile  statements  of  the 
relativity  of  simultaneity  with  a  belief  in 
absolute simultaneity and fail to confront the 
startling ideas of special relativity.

11 The  definition  of  a  global  coordinate  system 
breaks  down  in  non-inertial  frames  and  in 
general relativity. The restriction of an inertial 
frame to a finite extent in both space and time 
is  a  refinement  not  usually  encountered  in 
courses in special relativity. 

  The  second  clock

relativity includes sending the reading on one 
clock  to  a  clock  at  another  location  by  means 
of  some  signal. 
is 
synchronized with the first by setting it to read 
the  time  sent  from  the  first  clock  plus  the 
signal travel time.  The use of light signals for 
the synchronization of clocks is customary but 
not necessary.  See, for instance, the first book 
in Ref. 10. 

13 Although it is possible to define the time of an 
event as the time at which an observer sees the 
event,  the  time  then  depends  on  observer 
location.    Einstein,  for  instance,  considered 
and  rejected  such  a  definition. 
  See  A. 
Einstein,  “On  the  electrodynamics  of  moving 
bodies,”  in  The  principle  of  relativity:  A 
collection of original memoirs on the special 
and  general  theory  of  relativity (Dover, New 
York, NY, 1952). 

14 Some  authors  define  the  term  “observer”  to 
indicate  the  full  set  of  measuring  devices  and 
procedures  that  comprise  a  reference  frame.  
For  an  example  of  this  approach,  see  E.F. 
Taylor  and  J.A.  Wheeler,  Spacetime  Physics 
(W.H.  Freeman,  New  York,  NY,  1992),  pp. 
39. 

15 The  process  by  which  “time  is  spread  over 
space”  is  described  meticulously  in  the  first 
book in Ref. 10. 

16 For a description of the course for high school 
teachers, see L.C. McDermott, “A perspective 
on  teacher  preparation  in  physics  and  other 
sciences:    The  need  for  special  courses  for 
teachers,” Am. J. Phys. 58, 734-742 (1990). 
17  The  results  from  the  various  classes  at  the 
University  of  Washington  were  consistent 
within  statistical  fluctuations.    The  results 
from  the  other  universities  were  within  the 
same  range.    For  the  purposes  of  this  article, 

 

                                                                   
the  results  from  corresponding  classes  have 
been combined. 

18 The problems are “ungraded” in the sense that 
they  are  not  graded  for  correctness.    Rather, 
students  receive  credit  for  giving  responses 
that reflect an attempt to answer the questions.  
Student  performance  on 
the  examination 
questions and the ungraded problems was very 
similar.    This  is  consistent  with  the  results  of 
other investigations conducted by our group, 
in which we have found that students take the 
ungraded questions seriously.   

19 Each  research  question  was  posed  in  at  least 
two  ways,  with  different  context  and  slight 
changes in wording.   In general, we found that 
such  changes  had  little  effect  on  student 
performance.    Therefore,  in  this  paper  we 
present  only  a  representative  description  or 
example of each question. 

20 The  fact 

that 

the  curved  surface  of  a 
gravitating,  rotating  Earth  is  not  an  inertial 
frame  did  not  elicit  student  concern.    In  one 
version of the question, students were told to 
neglect  non-inertial  effects.    In  another,  the 
context  was  set  in  deep  space.    Neither 
statement seemed to change student responses. 

21 In  keeping  with  standard  practice  in  one-
dimensional  problems  on  special  relativity, 
students  were  told  in  all  questions  that  all 
motions  were  to  be  considered  as  occurring 
along  a  single  line  in  space.    No  student 
seemed  to  have  had  difficulty  neglecting  the 
vertical dimension. 

22 The prototype of such a qualitative analysis is 
that of the classic train paradox often used to 
develop the relativity of simultaneity.  See,  for 
instance,  P.A.  Tipler  and  R.A.  Llewellyn, 
Modern  Physics  (W.H.  Freeman,  New  York, 
NY, 1999). 

23 We use the notation dt instead of ? t, etc., to try 
to  minimize  confusion  between  the difference 
between  two  quantities  and  a  change  in  a 
quantity.    We  are  grateful to Eric Mazur for a 
discussion on this point. 

24 Since the events are separated by a spacelike 
interval  (c2d t2  –  d x2 < 0), students can predict 
the  existence  of  a  frame  in  which  the  events 
are  simultaneous  without  use  of  the  Lorentz 
transformations.

necessarily deepen conceptual understanding.

27 The  belief  in  absolute  simultaneity  may  be 
related  to  the  strong  belief  of  students  in  a 
preferred  reference  frame,  which  has  been 
the  context  of  Galilean 
in 
documented 
relativity.  See Refs. 5, 6, and 9. 

28 This term is related to the amount of time that 
the

synchronization  by  observers  in  the  ground 
frame.

distinct  reference  frame  is  similar  to  the  belief 
documented  in  Galilean  contexts  in  Ref.  4.

treat  the  ext ent  of  an  observer’s  reference 
frame  as  limited  to  the  physical  object  on 
which the observer is located (e.g., the deck of 
a boat).

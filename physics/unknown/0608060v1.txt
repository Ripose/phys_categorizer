We  address  the  concept  of  guiding  and  transporting  matter-wave  solitons  along  the 

channels of optical lattices made by interference patterns of beams containing topological 

wavefront  dislocations.  The  local  lattice  distortions  that  occur  around  the  dislocations 

cause solitons to move along reconfigurable paths, a phenomenon that may be used for 

controlled  all-optical  manipulation  of  Bose-Einstein  condensates.  Multiple  dislocations 

form traps that can capture and hold moving solitons. We also show that suitable lattice 

topologies  may  be  used  to  explore  matter-wave  soliton  collisions  and  interactions  in  a 

confined reconfigurable environment.

Interactions  between  atoms  forming  Bose-Einstein  condensates  result  in  a  rich 

variety  of  physical  phenomena.  Among  them  is  the  formation  of  different  types  of 

nonlinear self-sustained structures, or matter-wave solitons [1]. Various types of matter-

wave  solitons  have  been  experimentally  observed  to  date  in  geometries  where  the 

condensate  confinement  is  achieved  by  external  magnetic  and  optical  traps.  This 

includes  dark  [2],  bright  [3],  and  gap  [4]  solitons  created  in  condensates  with  both 

repulsive  and  attractive  inter-atomic  interactions,  as  well  as  the  recent  landmark 

experimental observation of three-dimensional multiple soliton formation in condensates 

with inter-atomic attractive interactions hold in three-dimensional traps [5]. 

Bose-Einstein condensates can also be hold in optical lattices (for a recent overview 

see, e.g., Ref. [6]), a physical setting that affords a wealth of important new phenomena. 

In  particular,  lattices  profoundly  affect  both  the  interactions  between  matter-wave 

solitons  and  their  stability.  A  key  advantage  that  makes  optical  lattices  especially

interesting  is  their  intrinsic  tunability.  Namely,  the  lattice  shape  and  its  depth  can  be 

readily  tuned  by  varying  the  propagation  angles  and  the  intensities  of  the  lattice-

creating  light  beams.  This  tunability,  in  turn,  allows  the  manipulation  of  condensate 

clouds  loaded  into  the  lattice  (see,  e.g.  Refs.  [7-15]).  The  concept  of  reconfigurable 

optical  lattices  finds  also  important  applications  in  nonlinear  optics,  where  lattices  can 

be  induced  optically  in  suitable,  highly  anisotropic  nonlinear  materials  (see,  e.g.,  Refs. 

[16-18]).  The  simplest  periodic  optical  lattice  can  be  constructed  by  several  interfering 

plane  waves.  Such  periodic  lattices  support  various  types  of  soliton  states,  whose 

properties  are  dictated  by  the  specific  topology  of  the  lattice  creating  waves.  In 

particular,  formation  of  soliton  trains  consisting  of  condensate  droplets  localized  in  the 

vicinity  of  the  lattice  maxima  is  possible  [19-21].  In  addition  to  sets  of  plane  waves, 

other types of nondiffracting light beams, such as Bessel beams, can be used for lattice 

induction  [22].  The  symmetry  of  such  beams  result  in  new  opportunities  for  soliton 

manipulation,  such  as  rotary  soliton  motion  (experimentally  demonstrated  in  [23])  and 

rotary  soliton  interactions,  as  well  as  reconfigurable  soliton  wires,  arrays,  and  matrices 

for  soliton  routing  and  transport  [24].  The  accessible  possibilities  are  restricted  to  the 

symmetry of the lattice. 

A  qualitatively  different  type  of  optical  lattices  may  be  constructed  with  optical 

landscapes  made by the  interference pattern of  regular  light  waves  and  singular  beams 

that contain topological wavefront dislocations. On physical grounds, one expects soliton 

behavior  in  the  vicinity  of  dislocations  to  change  drastically  thus  resulting  in  new 

possibilities for soliton control. For example, we predicted recently that in lattices made 

by the interference of tilted plane waves and beams carrying screw phase dislocations, or 

optical  vortices,  solitons  experience  attractive  and  repulsive  forces  by  the  dislocations, 

which may result in transverse displacements of solitons that were initially at rest [25]. 

Such phenomena suggest specific potential applications to dynamical matter-wave soliton 

manipulation,  which  we  address  in  details  in  this  paper.  More  specifically,  here  we 

consider,  for  the  first  time  to  our  knowledge,  the  collisions  of  moving  solitons  with 

dislocations  as  well  as  complex  phase-dependent  interactions  of  several  moving  solitons 

in  the  vicinity  of  dislocations,  which  could  find  applications  for controllable  condensate 

transport with topologically complex reconfigurable lattices.

We study in detail how the local distortion of the guiding lattice channels around 

the dislocations drags solitons along the corresponding paths, thus affording a new way 

to  transport  and  to  sort  simultaneously  matter-wave  solitons  that  can  be  brought 

together  to  collide  in  the  vicinity  of  the  dislocations.  We  also  find  that  suitable 

arrangements of multiple dislocations can form different soliton traps which are able to 

capture and hold solitons moving along the lattice channels. We show that the concept 

may  be  used  to  explore  specific  types  of  soliton  interactions  and  interferences,  because 

those are strongly affected by the geometry of the optical lattice. 

The  phenomena  we  study  here  arise  naturally  in  pancake-shaped  Bose-Einstein 

condensates hold in suitable lattices made with spatial light modulators, and they might 

hold too in nonlinear optics provided that the corresponding lattices can be made stable 

and robust. Therefore, for the sake of generality, we perform our study in the framework 

of a generic model of matter-wave and light evolution in a cubic nonlinear medium. We 

thus  address  the  evolution  of  a  Bose-Einstein  condensate  hold  in  an  optical  lattice, 

described  by  the  nonlinear  Schrödinger  equation  for  the  dimensionless  mean-field  wave

Here we assume that the optical lattice features the intensity of the interference pattern

lattices  of  this  type  can  be  generated,  e.g.,  by  using  spatial  light  modulators  [26,27], 

similar to those that have been successfully used for optical confinement of Bose-Einstein 

condensates [28]. 

Lattices produced by the interference of plane waves and waves with several nested 

vortices  are  not  stationary,  hence  they  slowly  distort  upon  propagation.  Nevertheless, 

they can be implemented in pancake-shaped, or disk-shaped, Bose-Einstein condensates, 

which are elongated in the transverse  (

, )η ζ

 plane but strongly confined in the direction 

of light propagation (

ρ

 axis), so that lattice-creating waves remain effectively constant 

inside  the  whole  condensate.  Such  a  strong  confinement  of  the  condensate  can  be 

achieved,  e.g.,  in  asymmetric  magnetic  harmonic  traps  with  the  ratio  of  oscillation 

frequencies

details  of  the  experimental  realization  of  lower-dimensional  condensates).  Thus,  the

than  the  characteristic  length  of  the  lattice  distortion.  We  always  set  values  of 

parameters in such way that the magnitudes of the linear and nonlinear terms in Eq. (1) 

are comparable. Thus, we let 

α =

 (which sets characteristic transverse scale of lattice

) and let 

p

of  additional  trapping  potentials  in  Eq.  (1)  because  of  the  difference  in  the  transverse 

scales of the parabolic potential and the optical lattice R

( , )η ζ

. 

Some representative examples of lattices produced by interference of a tilted plane 

wave  and  waves  with  nested  vortices  with  different  topological  charges  are  depicted  in 

Fig.  1.  The  presence  of  clearly  pronounced  lattice  channels  where  matter-wave  solitons 

can travel is apparent. Far from the dislocation, the lattice profile is similar to that of a 

quasi-one-dimensional  lattice  produced  by  the  interference  of  the  two  plane  waves 

exp(

iαη±

)

.  In  contrast,  because  of  the  screw  phase  dislocation  carried  by  one  of  the 

lattice-creating waves, several lattice channels fuse or vanish in the vicinity of the fork 

located  at  the  position  of  the  topological  dislocation.  This  is  accompanied  by  a  local 

distortion of the neighboring lattice channels. The higher the winding number  m  of the 

screw dislocation, the stronger the lattice distortion. 

Far  from  the  dislocation  fork,  the  lattice  channels  can  support  stable  solitons, 

whose maxima coincide with local maxima of the function 

(R

. We found families of 

such stationary solutions numerically in the form q

being a real function, and  −  being the chemical potential. When launched towards the 

b

fork  with  large  enough  initial  velocity 

  (this  can  be  achieved  with  standard  phase-

ζα

imprinting  techniques  [1]),  solitons  move  along  the  channel  where  they  are  initially 

loaded. As a result, the position of the soliton center shifts by  m

/π α

 along the  η  axis 

when solitons pass around a single dislocation fork (Fig. 1). Notice that when a soliton is 

launched  into  one  of  the  channels  that  merge  together  in  the  fork,  it  gets  either 

destroyed or it bounces back when it hits the dislocation fork. Such phenomenon makes 

possible the parallel transport of several solitons simultaneously launched into a lattice 

with several dislocations featuring multiple open and closed paths. This is illustrated in 

the bottom right plot of Fig. 1. The important idea behind this concept is the possibility 

to  add  or  to  remove  vortices  in  the  lattice-creating  wave,  hence  creating  new  soliton  

paths  along  which  several  solitons  can  be  brought  together  to  collide  in  the  vicinity  of 

dislocation. 

Suitable  combinations  of  dislocations  can  form  various  lattice  traps.  The  simplest 

trap  is  formed  when  two  vortices  nested  in  the  lattice-creating  wave  feature  opposite 

topological  charges  m

1= ±

  and  are  separated  by  the  distance  δζ   along  the  vertical 

direction. Depending on the mutual orientation of the vortices, the two channels of the 

 

5

resulting  lattice  can  either  fuse  first  and  split  in  a  second  dislocation  (we  term  this 

geometry a positive trap) or part of the lattice channel located between the dislocations 

can  disappear  (we  term  this  geometry  a  negative  trap).  In  what  follows,  we  consider 

positive traps as those illustrated in Fig. 2(a). Notice that the lattice channels close to 

the  one  forming  the  trap  are  almost  undistorted  and  therefore  solitons  launched  into 

these  channels  at  ζ

0<

  are  readily  transported  to  the  region  ζ

0>

.  In  contrast, 

solitons launched into one of the channels forming the trap can be either bounced back 

or  captured  by  the  trap.  In  the  latter  case,  captured  solitons  oscillate  inside  the  trap 

until a new, stationary trap mode is reached. We have found that soliton capturing by 

the  lattice  trap  is  only  possible  when  the  input  soliton  velocity 

ζα   exceeds  a  critical 

value, 

crα

.  Our  calculations  revealed  that  the  critical  velocity  growths  monotonically 

with the lattice depth and with the initial soliton norm (this is shown in Figs. 2(b) and 

2(c)). The possibility of soliton capturing by lattice traps enriches the set of operations 

accessible with distorted lattices. For example, lattice traps can also be produced by sets 

of higher-order, oppositely charged vortices. In this case, at fixed U  and 

p

 the critical 

velocity  is  found  to  rapidly  decrease  with  increase  of  vortex  charges  m .  Thus,  at 

U =

4.5

 and 

p =

1

 one has 

mα = ≈

, while  α

m= ≈

. 

The  optical  lattice  landscapes  that  we  address  in  here  offer  a  unique  setting  to 

generate  new  types  of  matter-wave  soliton  interactions  in  a  confined  environment.  We 

explored briefly the interactions between solitons guided by the lattice channels, and the 

outcome  of  the  interaction  can  be  strongly  altered  by  the  presence  of  the  lattice 

dislocation.  For  illustrative  purposes,  here  we  concentrate  in  the  case  of  two  identical 

solitons  with  a  phase  difference  δφ   located  in  neighboring  lattice  channels  that  are 

launched  simultaneously  toward  the  trap  with  a  given  velocity,  α .  Numerical 

ζ

simulations  show  that  the  output  strongly  depends  on  the  phase  difference  between 

solitons in new and non-trivial ways. In particular, attraction between in-phase solitons 

can  cause  penetration  of  both  solitons  inside  the  trap  despite  the  fact  that  the  initial 

velocity  is  well  below  the  critical  value  (in  this  case  α

cr ≈

0.47

).  This  phenomenon  is 

shown  in  Fig.  3(a).  In  contrast,  accurate  simulations  reveal  that  two  out-of-phase 

solitons cannot penetrate inside the trap and hence simultaneously bounce back even for 

velocities greatly exceeding the critical one. This phenomenon is depicted in Fig. 3(b). In 

the  case  of  arbitrary  phase  difference  between  the  input  solitons,  a  oscillating  state  is 

 

6

formed with U  oscillating periodically between the involved lattice channels. Depending 

on  the  exact  value  of  the  initial  phase  difference,  a  single  output  soliton  can  be 

eventually formed and bounced back into one of the guiding channels after collision with 

the lattice trap. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figs. 3(c) and 3(d). 

A  variety  of  additional  interactions  are  accessible  with  the  topologically  distorted 

lattices, by varying the parameters of the lattice-creating beams (e.g., the number, loci, 

and  winding  number  of  nested  topological  screw  dislocations)  and  of  the  input  soliton 

states  (e.g.,  soliton  norms  and  velocities).  A  comprehensive  investigation  of  such 

interactions falls beyond the scope of this paper, but a few illustrative examples follow. 

For example, increasing the winding number of the topological screw dislocation nested 

in  the  lattice-creating  waves  results  in  a  significant  enhancement  of  the  corresponding 

trap width. Thus, we found that out-of-phase solitons that collide in the vicinity of such 

wide  channels  may  penetrate  into  the  traps,  despite  of  the  repulsive  forces  acting 

between them; solitons might even escape from the trap provided that the input soliton 

velocities are high enough. This phenomenon is illustrated in Fig. 4(a). 

Simulations  reveal  that  the  outcome  of  the  collision  of  several  solitons  in  the 

vicinity  of  the  lattice  dislocation  depends  strongly  on  the  number  of  colliding  solitons 

and  on  their  relative  phase  differences.  For  example,  launching  additional  solitons 

toward  the  dislocation  from  the  region  ζ

0>

  completely  changes  the  outcome  of  the 

collision  depicted  in  Fig.  4(a).  When  one  additional  soliton  is  launched  at 

ζ >

0

  (it  is 

in-phase with soliton launched into left-hand-side channel and out-of-phase with soliton 

launched into right-hand-side channel at 

ζ <

0

) three solitons emerge upon the collision 

process, with one of them being captured by the trap, another one being bounced back 

into one of the channels emerging from the trap, and only one soliton penetrates into the 

region 

ζ >

0

. An illustrative example is shown in Fig. 4(b). 

Interestingly, collisions of several solitons arriving to the trap from both the upper 

(located  at  ζ

0>

)  and  the  lower  (located  at 

ζ <

0

)  channels  may  result  in  the 

formation of higher-order nonlinear trap modes, which might be termed multipole-mode 

trap solitons. Dipole trap solitons might be formed when two out-of-phase input solitons 

with  initial  velocities  substantially  exceeding  a  critical  value  collide  inside  the  trap,  as 

depicted in Fig. 4(c) and 4(d). Our calculations show that  dipole-mode  soliton  form  in 

this  case  for  different  choices  of  channels  where  the  input  solitons  are  launched. 

 

7

Similarly, we verified that triple-mode trap solitons can be formed upon collision of three 

single solitons with appropriately chosen velocities and phases. 

We thus conclude stressing that we have addressed in detail the concept of matter-

wave  soliton  control  in  optical  lattices  containing  topological  fork  dislocations.  Such 

lattices  can  be  created  in  pancake-shape  Bose-Einstein  condensates  with  spatial  light 

modulators; they feature complex guiding channels where solitons can be routed and let 

interact. The concept is intended to hold for different optical landscapes produced by the 

interference  of  light  waves  carrying  screw  phase  dislocations,  including  Laguerre-

Gaussian modes. In this paper we pose the idea for matter-wave soliton states, but the 

concepts might hold as well for optical solitons, provided that stable suitable lattices can 

be inducted or technologically fabricated in nonlinear crystals in a robust way.

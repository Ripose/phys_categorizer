Summary 
 
Records of geomagnetic measurements have been analyzed looking for evidences 

of possible precursors for magnetic storms. With this objective, the main magnetic 

storms  in  the  period  1998-2002  have  been  located  in  Dst  index  record.  Periods 

immediately before storms and periods well before them were studied by applying 

a method recently introduced in the literature. Statistical properties of both types of 

periods have been compared. One of the compared quantities was the slope of the 

power  laws  that  have  been  found  for  some  relevant  distributions.  A  systematic 

deviation between slope distributions was found. This might be the fingerprint of a 

non self-organized component in records. There has also been found a correlation 

between  slope  values  and  the  corresponding  storm intensities, which could serve 

as  a  probabilistic  approach  to  magnetic  storms  forecasting.    Data  is  from  the  low 

latitude Vassouras Magnetic Observatory.

Introduction 
 

Geomagnetic  storms  and  geomagnetic  reversals  (Ponte-Neto  and  Papa, 

2006) are the most striking phenomena in the magnetic field that we can measure 

at  the  Earth’s  surface.  Geomagnetic  storms  are  periods  from  one  to  three  days 

during  which  the  magnetic  field  born  at  the  Sun  surface  and  atmosphere  of  the 

Earth  presents  strong  variations  that,  among  other  things,  seriously  affect 

telecommunication  transmissions.  Some  evidences  suggest  that  during  magnetic 

storms the number of heart attacks increases in relation to calm periods (Halberg 

et  al.,  2001).  Very  recently  (November  2003),  around  50000  Swedish  people 

suffered  an  energy  blackout  during  a  short  period  of  time  caused  by  a  strong 

magnetic storm. This was also the case during the year of 1989 (but lasting more 

than  nine  hours)  for  the  region  of  Quebec,  in  Canada.  For  some  scientific  and 

technical applications (for example, measurements of the crustal magnetic field for 

prospecting  purposes,  and  directional  drilling)  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field  is 

supposed  to  be  known  and  used  as  a  reference  (Gleisner  et  al.,  2005).  Any 

variation  or  deviation  from  undisturbed  values  may  be  the  source  of  unwanted 

errors.  There  are  other  methods  of  prospecting  (MT,  for  example)  in  which  the 

occurrence of magnetic perturbations (far from measurement points to accomplish 

the condition of plane wave front) is desired and useful.  

All  the  reasons  mentioned  above  justify  the  search  for  methods  that  allow 

predict  magnetic  storms  at  medium  and  long  terms.  But  as  in  the  case  of  other 

catastrophic  events  (earthquakes,  for  example)  that  affect  human  activities  and 

threat  human  life  there  do  not  exist  yet  methods  to  accomplish  this  task  in  a 

reliable manner.  

Magnetic storms have been advanced as possible candidates to precursors 

of  other  geophysical  phenomena  like  earthquakes  (Enescu,  2005;  Kushwah, 

2004).  However,  this  is  a  very  recent  proposal  and  it  is  a  point  of  current 

discussion.     

Many  efforts  have  been  devoted  to  study  statistical  properties  of  magnetic 

measurements  at  the  Earth’s  surface  and  satellites  during  the  last  five  decades. 

We can mention, for example, a pioneering power spectrum study for the magnetic 

field around the world (Alldredge et al., 1963), and more recently, an intermittency 

analysis  of  geomagnetic  series  (Bolzan  et  al,  2005),  a  detrended  fluctuation 

analysis  on  Sym-H  index  record  (Wanliss,  2005),  and  a  statistical  study  of  direct 

magnetic field measurements (Papa et al., 2006). 

The  search  for  geomagnetic  storms  precursors  can  be  done  from  some 

Earth grounded systems as, for example, muon detectors (Jansen et al, 2001) and 

geomagnetic  observatories.  There  are  also  some  Earth  and  satellites  systems  to 

study  visible  light  and  X-ray  burst  during  solar  flares  (Yermolaev  and  Yermolaev, 

2003). However, as well as in the case of the possibility of magnetic storms being 

earthquakes  precursors,  this  possibility  requires  further  scrutiny  (Yermolaev  and 

Yermolaev,  2006).  For  a  comprehensible  review,  on  scientific  models  for  space 

weather developments, see the work by Lathuillère et al. (2002).  

The inspiration for the present work came mostly from the works by Wanliss 

(2005)  and  Papa  et  al.  (2006).  However  our  work  follows  well  defined  different 

lines.  Wanliss  developed  an  extensive  study  (from  1981  to  2000)  of  fractal 

properties  of  the  Sym-H  index  dividing  the  record  in  quiet  and  active  intervals 

(based  on  Kp  values),  while  Papa  et  al.  concentrated  their  efforts  in  studying  a 

short  period  of  time  (October  2000)  through  a  Fourier  analysis  of  magnetic 

measurements  that  diminish  some  of  the  problems  that  are  normally  faced 

because  the  non-stationary  character  of  those  series.  Here  we  compare  fractal 

properties  of  relatively  calm  periods,  some  of  them  near  magnetic  storms’ 

beginnings  and  some  others  far  (see  below)  from  magnetic  storms.  We  also 

compare  those  properties  with  the  corresponding  magnetic  storms  intensities.  A 

possibility for medium term (~ three days) magnetic storm probabilistic forecasting 

emerges.    

Data analysis and Preparation 

The  Dst  and  Sym-H  indexes  are  essentially  the  same  thing  except  for  the 

time  resolution  (one  hour  for  Dst  and  one  minute  for  Sym-H).  However,  it  is  Dst 

that is widely used as a magnetic storm revealer. It is often taken the value –50 nT 

of  that  index  as  the  threshold  to  consider  that  a  magnetic  storm  is  taken  place 

(Maltsev,  2003).  Figure  1  presents the variation of the Dst index for the month of 

October  2000.  The  data  was  obtained  at 

the  World  Data  Centre 

for 

Geomagnetism,  Kyoto  (WDC).  The  unique  general  feature  for  storm  periods  that 

we can note from Figure 1 and other monthly periods (not shown) is that does not 

exist any general feature for those periods. There are, however, two characteristics 

that  are  present  in  a  great  number  of  magnetic  perturbation  cases:  a  sudden 

decrease in Dst values (during a few hours) and a slow recovering to values near 

zero (i.e., “normal” values).  We based our data selection and preparation on those 

features. 

To avoid problems resulting from the highly non-stationary character of Dst 

series  there  are  two  policies  that  are  normally  used.  The  first  obtains  robust 

averages  through  studies  of  long  periods  of  time  (Wanliss,  2005).  The  second, 

assuming a quasi-stationary character for the series, studies short periods of time. 

In this work our choice was the last one. 

The preparation of data consists in two set of relatively simple steps that we 

describe now. The value –50 nT of the Dst index was used as the threshold criteria 

to locate the beginning of magnetic storms.  We have located the date and hour of 

the beginning of all the magnetic storms in the period 1998–2002, obtaining around 

130  occurrences  (~  two  by  month).  The  last  value  greater  or  equal  to  –10  nT 

before the –50 nT value that marks the storm beginning was considered to be the 

beginning of the transient before storms. Not all the periods with values greater or 

equal  to  –50  nT  classify  as  storm  with  those  criteria  because  we  have  not 

considered  transients  greater  than  10  hours.  The  corresponding  “storm”  does  not 

enter  our  record.  They  are  walkings  of  Dst  in  far  from  zero  values  or  rests  of 

previous storms. The mean value for the jump period from a value greater than –10 

nT values below –50 nT corresponds to around 6 hours, and this value was used 

for all the storms. We have also eliminated from our record the periods of Dst less 

than  –50  nT  too  close  to  previous  storms  because  would  not  have  the  complete 

period to be studied (see below). The final result was a set with around 50% of the 

periods  with  some  point  at  Dst  values  lesser  than  –50  nT,  giving  60  magnetic 

storms. Table 1 presents storms that entered the set to be studied.  

Once determined from Dst records the periods of interest we have applied a recent 

methodology  (Papa  et  al.,  2006)  to  two  types  of  periods  before  storms.  We  have 

investigated two time windows of three days: the three consecutive days before the 

transient  beginning  and  the  three  consecutive  days  before  them.  In  a  few  words 

the  methodology  consists  in  applying  a  Fourier  transform  to  the  selected  data, 

filtering  it  through  a  second  order  Butterworth filter, returning the transform to the 

time  domain  and,  finally,  calculate  the  difference  ∆H  between  original  and  filtered 

data  (see  the  work  by  Papa  et  al.  (2006)  for  details).  The  ∆H  distribution  is  the 

object  of  study.  When  we  apply  this  methodology  to  relatively  long  periods  (one 

month)  we  obtain  distributions  for  ∆H  that  obey  to  power  laws.  Power  laws  have 

the form:  

( )
xf

.=

dxk

                                                          (1) 

where  f(x)  is  the  frequency  distribution  on  the  variable  x,  k  is  a  proportionality 

constant and d is the exponent of the power law (power laws have the property of 

appearing as straight lines in log-log plots). 

The distribution of ∆H for the month of October 2000 is shown in Figure 2. There is 

a  two-regime  power  law  with  a  knee  between  both  regimes  always  at  values 

between  10  nT  and  20  nT.  Applying  the  methodology  to  three  days  periods  is  a 

dangerous  strategy  because  we  dramatically  diminish  (by  a  factor  of  10)  the 

number  of  data  (giving  a  worse  statistics,  therefore).  A  typical  result  for  a  three 

days  period  is  shown  in  Figure  3a.  Now,  the  second  power  law  regime  is 

completely  lost.  We  have  performed  our  analysis  on  the  slope  of  the  power  law 

regime  here  present.  As  a  consequence  of  the  statistical  worsening  we  have 

established  a  threshold  for  the  accuracy  of  slopes.  Slopes  with  relative  error 

greater  than  20%  were  dropped  out  of  the  set  under  consideration.  We  have 

included in the study, at the end, around 45 storms. 

The amplitude-frequency distribution of the direct Fourier transform follows also a 

power law distribution with slopes values around one. A typical result can be seen 

in Figure 2b. We have studied in parallel their distribution. 

Before  presenting  the  Results  and  Discussion  section  there  are  a  few  comments 

that  we  would  like  to  do  on  data  analysis  and  preparation.  Because  of  the  highly 

irregular  behavior  of  Dst  it  was  not  possible  to  establish  an  automatic  (man  free) 

computer  procedure  to  select  the  periods  to  be  considered.  In  this  sense,  the 

results here presented are a hand-made product. They were individually analyzed 

case  by  case.  A  similar  situation  was  faced  when  analyzing  the  slopes  of  ∆H 

distributions. This can be a serious difficulty to extend the study to longer periods 

and to do studies with validation purposes.       

 

Results and Discussion 

It  is  well  known  that  distributions  of  magnetic  field  measurements  (Papa  et  al, 

2006)  as  well  as  values  of  some  geomagnetic  indexes  (Wanliss,  2005)  present 

power laws or, in other words, might be compatible with some fractal system.  

In  Figure  4  we  present  the  time  dependence  of  the  slope  in  ∆H  and  transform 

amplitude  distributions  for  the  period  1998-2002.  As  can  be  seen  in  panel  a  of 

Figure  4,  while  there  does  not  exist  a  one-to-one  correlation  between  slopes  for 

periods  near  and  far  from  storms,  there  seems  to  be  a  common  long  term  trend 

(increasing  as  time  goes  by)  in  both  slope  values.  No  trivial  trend  is  observed  in 

panel b of Figure 4. These results can be partially corroborated in Figure 5 where 

correlation graphs between slopes in both types of periods are shown. In panel a of 

Figure  5  a  concentration  of  points  around 

the  straight-line  y=x 

is  clear 

(independently of the used scales). In Figure 5b this concentration is not observed. 

Figure 6 shows the slope distributions for both types of three days intervals during 

the period 1998-2002. The distribution in Figure 6a shows a trend to higher slope 

values  (lower  in  absolute  value)  for  periods  closer  to  storms.  This  tendency  has 

also been noted in studies on the Kp index (Dias et al., 2006). The distributions in 

Figure 6b are statistically indistinguishable as shown by a set of tests that we have 

performed  (considering  them  as  single  peak  distributions).  It  is  remarkable, 

however,  the  presence  of  double  peak  distributions  for  both  kinds  of  periods  (but 

this has to be confirmed by studies on larger sets of data). Two-peak distributions 

in some fractal properties of Sym-H index have also been found (Wanliss, 2005). 

The tendency presented in Figure 6a could be the fingerprint of a non self-similar 

component  in  geomagnetic  records,  which  means  that  effective  medium  term 

forecasting might be a no so hard task. 

Finally,  in  Figure  7,  we  present  the  dependence  of  slopes  on  the  corresponding 

magnetic  storm  intensity.  A  well-behaved  forbidden  region  is  noted  in  Figure  7a 

while  a  not  so  well  delimited  forbidden  region  is  observed  in  Figure  7b.  For 

forecasting  purposes  forbidden  regions  are  useful.  While  they  can  no  tell  what  is 

going  to  happen,  at  least  they  can  tell  us  what  kind  of  events  are  not  going  to 

happen  or  the  likelihood  of  a  given  event.  Let  us  briefly  exemplify  those 

affirmations  with  base  in  Figure  7a.  It  can  be  deduced  from  Figure  7a  that  if  the 

slope  for  the  period  near  storm  is  below  the  value  –2.5  then  the  corresponding 

storm  will  never  have  intensity  greater  than  –150  nT.  On  the  other  hand,  we  can 

see from the same figure that, if the slope for the nearest period is between –1.75 

and  –1.25  there  is  around  30%  of  probability  for  the  corresponding  storm  to  be 

more intense than –150 nT. The 30% probability was obtained by noting that there 

are five points (circles) in the rectangle formed by the values d = –1.75 and –1.25 

and storm-intensity = –150 nT and –325 nT, while there are ten points (also circles) 

in the rectangle formed by the same values of d and storm-intensity = –150 nT and 

–50 nT. It should also be noted from Figure 7a that, given that there are not slope 

values  above  –0.9,  the  periods  near  storms  define  a  more  restrictive  forbidden 

region  (circles)  if  compared  with  the  forbidden  region  defined  by  periods  far  from 

storms (squares). This is intuitively clear if we believe that there is some effective 

change in slopes from one period type to the other as it seems to be the case: the 

closer  the  period  to  the  storm  the  more  accurate  description  it  provides  on  the 

We consider the results presented in Figure 7 the main finding of the present work.     

subsequent storm. 

 

Conclusions 

We  have  studied  the  change  in  fractal  properties  of  magnetic  data  from  our  low 

latitude Vassouras Magnetic Observatory and their relation with storms intensities. 

There  are  several  things  to  be  learnt  from  our  study.  There  are  periods  with  Dst 

values > –50 nT that accomplish the requirements of having a sudden decrease in 

a  few  hours  and  a  relaxation  for  several  days.  So,  the  used  criteria  (although 

widely  used  in  the  literature)  seem  to  be  quite  subjective.  It  is  not  too  difficult  to 

imagine  the  geomagnetic  activity  as  a  continuous  small  storms  release  with  very 

scarcely strong storms (similar to the way in which behave the Sun surface). From 

our  results  it  is  possible  to  envisage  a  probabilistic  forecasting  method.  However, 

further  scrutiny  will  be  necessary.  There  are  some  works  running  on  these  lines 

and, given the difficulty mentioned at the end of the Data analysis and Preparation 

section, will be published, someday, elsewhere.

Mass differences between octet strange baryons, octet and decuplet strange

baryons, and  nonet  vector  mesons  and  octet  baryons  of  equal  strangeness

coincide  (within  the  small  experimental  uncertainties)  with  the  levels  of  a

recently  proposed  hadron  mass  spectrum.  A  number,  M,  characterises  the

mass difference in relation to the strange quark mass of the spectrum. The

mass  difference  of  Λ  and  Σ0  (∆I=1)  is  characterised  by  M= +1,  while  the

mass difference of Σ0 and Σ(1385)0 (∆J=1) is characterised by M=-1. Vector

meson-baryon  (∆J=½)  mass  differences  are  characterised  by  M=-1/2.  The

mass  differences  of  strange  decuplet  baryon  resonances  (∆S=1)  are

characterised  by  M=-2  and  M=-3,  where  M  is  equal  to  the  strangeness  of

the more massive baryon.

The  quark  mass  evaluations  of  the  Particle  Data  Group,  [1]  are  consistent  with  the  values  of

‘mass  levels’  which  descend  from  the  Planck  Mass  (1.2210  ±  0.0009  x1019  GeV), 

Pm ,  in  a

geometric series of common ratio 2/π. [2] The mass of the nth level in the spectrum is defined as

Hadron  singlet  states  occupy  ‘higher  order’  mass  sub-levels  of  fractional  (half-integer,  quarter-

integer, eighth integer, etc) n; doublet states lie either side of mass levels. [2] Charged leptons,

neutral  vector  meson  resonances  and  the  neutral  vector  boson,  Z,  occupy  mass  sub-levels  in  a

remarkable symmetric arrangement. [3]

‘Mass partnerships’ occur between particles of, normally, equal strangeness but different isospin,

isospin projection or spin, the particle mass differences approximating to the masses of principal

(integer  n)  and  low  order  levels.  Where  there  is  a  difference  in  spin,  the  mass  partnership  is

between isospin multiplets. For certain hadron mass partnerships, the mass differences calculated

from  Particle  Data  Group  values,  [4]  are  equal  to  the  masses  of  principal  levels,  as  shown  in

Figure 1. The mass difference of Λ and Σ0 is 76.959 ± 0.023 MeV, for which n = 103.001 ± 0.003,

that of Σ0 and Σ(1385)0 is 191.1 ± 1.0 MeV, for which n = 100.99 ± 0.01, and that of Σ+ and Σ- is

8.08 ± 0.08 MeV, for which n = 107.99 ± 0.02. In the mass partnership between K* (S=-1) and Σ

(S=-1), the mass representing the isospin doublet is that of the associated, interstitial, mass level;

1

the mass representing the isospin triplet is that of the neutral state. By this definition, the mass

difference of K* and Σ is 298.85 ± 0.68 MeV, for which n = 99.996 ± 0.005. Similarly, the mass

difference of φ (S=0,  ss ) and Ξ (S=-2, 

uss −

dss

) is 298.13 ± 0.99 MeV, for which n = 100.002

± 0.007. Uncertainties in doublet masses stem from uncertainty in 

Pm .

Many hadrons of identical spin-parity are also related in mass. [1] In such relationships, the mass

of  a  hadron  results  from  the  addition  of  valence  quark  masses,  as  derived  from  the  mass

spectrum,  to  the  mass  of  a  neutral  ‘precursor’  hadron.  Examples  of  these  ‘mass  construction’

relationships are:

In such relationships, the most massive hadron could be a singlet state, the most massive state

of a doublet or the neutral state of a triplet. No exceptions to these rules have been identified.

The  mass  construction  relationships  are  not  exact,  at  least  for  the  singlet  states,  because  the

hadrons are constrained to occupy mass levels. [1]

Pairs of decuplet baryon resonances for which ∆S=1 are related in mass by a mass construction

process in which fractional values of n correspond to the resonance mass differences. The mass

difference of ∆(1232) and Σ(1385)0 is 151.5 ± 1.9 MeV,1 for which n = 101.501 ± 0.028, that of

Σ(1385)0 and Ξ(1530)- is 151.3 ± 1.6 MeV, for which n = 101.504 ± 0.024, and that of Ξ(1530)0

and Ω- is 140.65 ± 0.61 MeV, for which n = 101.665 ± 0.009.

                                                          
1 The ∆(1232) states are associated with a low order level, of mass 1232.2 MeV.

The values of mass difference (∆m)  discussed  here,  between  hadrons  or  multiplets  of  different

isospin,  spin  or  strangeness,  fall  within  two  principal  mass  level  intervals  of  the  strange  quark

level (n=102), of mass 120.92 MeV. Mass differences between strange hadrons are characterised

by a value of 

mn∆  which is related to the quantum numbers, I, J and S, of the particles. Where

∆I=1, 

102−∆mn

 has the value +1. Where ∆J=1, the quantity 

102−∆mn

 has the value –1, and

where  ∆J=½, 

102−∆mn

  has  the  value  –2.  In  the  mass  construction  of Ξ-  (S=-2), 

102−∆mn

has  the  value  -½,  and  in  the  mass  construction  of  Ω-  (S=-3), 

102−∆mn

  has  the  value  –1/3.

In this paper we present a vibration spectrum of a homogenous parallelepiped
(HP) under the action of volume and surface forces resulting from the exponent
displacements entering the Fourier transforms.   Vibration under the action of
axial   surface   tractions   and   the     free   vibration   are   described   separately.   A
relationship  between  the high  frequency vibration  and  boundary  conditions
(BC) is also considered. 

Key   words:  homogenous   parallelepiped,
 plane   strain   state,   source-free
displacements,  shear and normal – free BC, free-BC, weakened BC, vibration
spectrum,  high frequency vibration

1.INTRODUCTION

The catastrophic events in Paris and Moscow are commonly blamed on
bad workmanship or improper materials. This reminds us in some sense of other
catastrophic events  at  the  beginning of XX century for which oversimplified
(engineering)   description   of   structural   elements   was   held   responsible,   see
A.Krilov introduction to Mushelishvili (1949). Hence, as a starting point of the
present paper we chose the classical elastodynamical equations



-  the volume force.  

One of purposes of the paper is to generalize with the help of Eqs (1.1)
existing   engineering   theories   of   rectangular   beams   like   Euler-Bernoulli,
Timoshenko   or   even   Levinson’s   new   rectangular   beam   theory,     Han   et   al.
(1999), Levinson (1981). We assumed a body in the shape of parallelepiped in
the most general plane strain state (PSS) defined in Sec.2. 

In the paper we describe the vibration of HP in PSS subjected to surface

forces (tractions) acting only upon its bases (ends) and free vibrations.

Our approach is based on a semi-inverse method which specifies  a family
of elementary displacements of HP in PSS by means of which we reproduce the

1

fields of external forces acting upon the HP. The volume force field is directly
reproduced by means of Eqs (1.1) with unknown  
. The surface traction

 is reproduced by means of Cauchy’s formula

1.1. ACCEPTED CONVENTIONS

We use Einstein’s convention in which the repeated index is summed over, if
the  same  index   is   absent   on   the   other  side   of   an   equation.   The   expression:
“wave vector k” means only that k can also take negative values. To stress that
we are concerned exclusively with small vibration, at certain components of the

stress vector t


  we omit appropriate components of the normal vector n

. 

2. PLANE STRAIN STATE (PSS). SOURCE-FREE DISPLACEMENTS

The deformation of a body is described as plane strain if the displacement

vector  u
 of any point is parallel to a certain plane called the deformation plane
and is independent of the distance of the point under consideration to this plane,
Amenzade (1979). We assume that the deformation plane is identical to plane

This relation among components of the stress tensor in PSS means that in
the case of free lateral surfaces of HP, 
, and this leads to the source-
free displacement field – a property with many implications. In this case,
which we assume throughout the paper, the PSS is simultaneously the plane
stress state, because by definition, the plane stress state is characterized by
the following stress tensor:

components of the stress tensors appear in the form of inhomogeneous terms
or coefficients -  in derived, simplified (engineering) equations, Kączkowski
(2000;   page-24)   and   can   be   treated   as  sources  of   the   field   under
consideration. 

3. PARTICULAR DISPLACEMENTS AND LOADINGS

We   would   like   to   show   that   by   means   of   exponential   functions
entering the Fourier transform and by means of superposition principle one
can   construct   elementary   displacements   which   satisfy   Eqs   (2.4-5)   or
equivalently Eqs (1.1). Moreover, parameters entering displacements can be
chosen in such a way that the surface tractions appear only upon the bases

4

of   HP.   For   the   particular   choice   of   parameters   under   consideration,   the
volume forces also disappear.

Following   Romanów   (1995)   we   do   not   specify   the   thickness   of   a

body.

related   to   the   (3.3)   “synchronization”     of   the  z,   x  and  t-dependences   of

This means that in the case when the normal tractions disappear upon the top

and bottom surfaces of HP in PSS, the functions 
surfaces. As a result of this property and equation, C=0, the dispersion relations
(3.16) can be derived. 

3.4. VOLUME AND HP GENERATORS –FREE BC. AN ALTERNATIVE

As we have seen above, the absence of shear tractions upon the bottom
and top surfaces of HP and the free-lateral BC  in PSS leads to Eqs (3.5), which
in   the   case   of  C=0  (absence   of   volume   forces;   Sec.4)  give   the   following

The   above   alternative   together   with   shear-free   BC   on   the   bottom   and   top
surfaces  and  lateral-free BC guarantee that  the volume forces,  related  to  the
displacements (3.1), disappear. 

In the case of the normal-free BC on the bottom and top surfaces and
lateral -free BC (Sec.3.3) the first term of the alternative (3.14) cannot occur
because of (3.13).  From the second term of the above alternative the following
dispersion relation implies

Displacements (3.1), for an arbitrary choice of functions 

)(z , satisfy the
traction-free   BC   on   the   lateral   surfaces   of   the   HP   (Eqs.   (2.4))   in   all   cases
considered. It turns out that additional conditions assuming the traction-free BC
on the top, bottom and lateral surfaces lead to very high frequency vibration in
which the wavelength of vibration modes may be comparable to the thickness
dimension of the HP, see (3.16). In the face of such results we would like to
examine some weakening of BC.  We base upon intuition that vibration of
HP   made   of   thin   and   hard   materials   do   not   depend   on   the   normal
components of the tractions acting on the top and bottom surfaces, when
their absolute values are approximately equal at both sides of the HP. 

There is an easy way of checking that the above intuition holds the static
case. A sheet of paper deflecting under the action of the horizontal tractions
acting on their ends   will not change its deflection under the influence of an
arbitrary   compensated   field  of  the  normal   tractions  acting  upon   the   top  and
bottom surfaces. 

Taking an arbitrary field of displacements we cannot be sure that they
correspond to the above commonly compensated normal tractions. However, in
the case of a slowly changing field and thin HP this occurs in every case. 

Let us examine such a possibility, for the alternative (3.14). Using the

first term of the alternative (3.14), we get from (3.2)

varying functions along the thickness of HP. This makes it possible to satisfy
the  proposed weakening of BC. In the first case, in which functions 
 are
given by (3.19) and h is a small quantity, a small deviation of HP from the ideal
shape   of   the   parallelepiped   may   cause   lack   of   compensation   of   the   normal
tractions on the opposite surfaces.  

)(zn

Restrictions upon the vector  k can be obtained if instead of the rejected
condition (3.6) we use other more familiar conditions like vanishing of tractions
or their components upon the bases (end faces) of HP. But for that purpose we
have   to   use   more   general   solutions   than   (3.1)   by   using   the   superposition
principle.

Displacements (4.1-3), with discrete spectral functions (4.8) and (4.11),

“Almost free” means that in the weakened BC the normal tractions on the
top and bottom surfaces of HP may not vanish but they should be compensated
to each other. The reader will remember that due to such BC long wavelength
vibration of HP are possible.

To use the weakened BC proposed in Sec. 3.5, we need displacements

only for very short waves which by definition are much shorter then the overall
dimensions of the body, Langley et al. (1998).

4.5.VOLUME FORCES. SINGULARITIES OF THIN HP

The elementary displacements (3.1) are responsible also for presence of the
volume forces acting on HP. Choosing (3.3) of the multiplicative constant  c

forces is the vertical one

The separate terms of the sum (4.17) may take large values, for thin HP 
This property is additionally enhanced for long HP 
when tractions on the
ends of HP vanish, see (4.15). In other words, for thin HP, it is much easier to
produce   harmonic   vibrations   with   the   alternative   (3.14)   and   the   dispersion
relation (3.15) than to produce vibration caused by non vanishing volume force
(4.17) with the dispersion relations (3.12).

5. FINAL REMARKS

The difference of present approach from Levinson’s work (1985) consists in
the assumption that HP is in PSS and that we exclusively use the stress BC.

13

The  displacement  BC  can  be  deduced  from the  stress  BC. In  particular,  the
engineering BC which depend on used models, see Han et al. (1999), can be
deduced.  

We carefully examine the influence of the BC used upon the space and time
dependence of elementary displacements (3.1). Lack of tractions on the lateral
surfaces of HP led to source-free displacements. Lack of tractions on the top
and bottom surfaces led to discrete values  of the wave vector  k  and to high
frequency   vibration   (sic!)   particularly   for   thin   HP.   This   phenomenon   is
probably related to the fact that we consider simultaneously in-plane and out-
plane vibration, Hyde et al. (2001). The fact that with the help of weakened BC,
see below, one can describe low frequency and low wave vibration  contrasts
with results of engineering theories which show that for



(5.1)
the spatial solution only has sinusoidal terms, see Han et al. (1999; 950 page).
This may means that sinusoidal solutions obtained in this way can be unstable
and   particularly   in   the   vacuum   and   weightlessness   conditions   only   short
sinusoidal waves can be observed. 

It   turns   out   that   restrictions   coming   from   the   disappearance   of   only   one

component of the stress vector  t
on the top and bottom surfaces of HP did not
confine values of the wave vector  k. This fact and the hypothesis that normal
components do not influence deflections of thin HP if the top and bottom parts
have approximately equal absolute values but opposite senses, allows us to take
into   account,   at   the   ends   (bases)   of   HP,   additional   BC   which   admit   lower
frequency vibration. In general, these are forced vibration, but after choosing
antisymmetric   spectral   functions   (4.8)   –   the   almost   free   vibration   can   be
obtained. 

 The vibration under axial tractions acting on the bases of HP are described
by formulas (4.1-3) in which the spectral functions have the filtering property of
the Dirac delta function (4.7) and the dispersion relations (3.16) take place. In
this case boundedness of vibration is reduced to examination of  boundedness
of the Fourier transforms of the spectral functions, Glisson (1985).  

It is also worth noticing that the presence of the z-independent  component in
), which in engineering description is exclusively
the vertical vibration (
assumed, is  responsible  for the presence of volume forces depending  on the
thickness  and  length  of  HP  in  a  way which  is  not   acceptable.  These   forces
diminish with the growing thickness of HP. 

0C

At   the   end   we   give   some   illustrations   of   elementary   displacements   (3.1)
confining ourselves to their real or imaginary parts, of course. We use the public
program “SmallDyn2”, see Nusse et al. (1997), with the help of which we draw
the   direction   and   displacement   fields.   In   the   case   of   PSS   we   obtain   full
information about these fields drawing them in a cross-section parallel to the

14

deformation   plane  OXZ.  Such   a   cross-section   is   represented   by   a   net   of
uniformly situated  nodes  which  represent  the  distinguished  particles  or  cells
before deformation. In the case of the direction field, an arrow is going out from
every node which sense is changing after one cycle. For the displacement field,
the length of arrows is proportional to the length of the displacement vector at a
given point. 

Let us assume that we have two conjugate solutions (3.1) with k and –k  such
that   (4.8)   takes   place.   Then   from   the   superposition   principle   we   get   a   new
solution

Here the “constant” C3 represents the time-dependent exponent of (5.1). Other
constants C1,2 are related in an obvious way to c and k. In fact, due to complex
number description used in the paper, we can consider trigonometric functions
with other initial  phases, like in Zhao et al. (2001) where such products  are
considered as bases functions, for a description of the high frequency vibration.

operating   on   the   ends   of   HP,   are
relatively big. It is remarkable that in
all cases the corresponding direction
fields are very regular and clear express the source-free character of the used
displacements.

We used a Cs atomic fountain frequency standard to measure the Stark shift of the ground state hyperfine transition frequency 
in  cesium  (9.2  GHz)  due  to  the  electric  field  of  the  blackbody  radiation.  The  measured  relative  shift  at 300  K  is                 
(-1.43±0.11)x10-14 and agrees with our theoretical evaluation (-1.49±0.07)x10-14. This value differs from the currently accepted 
one  (-1.69±0.04)x10-14.  The  difference  has  a  significant  implication  on  the  accuracy  of  frequency  standards,  in  clocks 
comparison, and in a variety of high precision physics tests such as the time stability of fundamental constants.

Laser  cooled  cesium  fountains  are  presently  the  most 
accurate  frequency  standards  as  they  allow  to  reach  the 
1x10-15 accuracy level [1-4]. These capabilities offer great 
opportunities in a variety of precision measurements, such 
as frequency metrology and realization of the International 
Atomic  Time  (TAI)  [5],  high  accuracy  spectroscopy  [6], 
laboratory  tests  of  fundamental  constant  time  stability  [7] 
and  therefore  validation  of  general  relativity  and  string 
theory [8].  
In  a  fountain,  the  reference  Cs  hyperfine  transition 
frequency  in  the  62S1/2  level  is  perturbed  by  four  main 
effects:  the  density  shift  caused  by  cold  Cs  atomic 
collisions 
the 
quantization  magnetic  field  [10],  the  red  shift  due  to  the 
Earth gravitational potential (clearly, this effect is relevant 
only  for  frequency  comparison  among  clocks  at  different 
height  on  the  geoid)  [10]  and  finally  the  AC  Stark  shift 
induced  by  the  Black  Body  Radiation  (BBR)  of  the 
environment  (the  AC  Zeeman  shift  is  three  order  of 
magnitude lower) [11]. These shifts have to be corrected in 
order  to  match  the  definition  of  the  second  in  the 
International System of Units (SI) [12] and therefore they 
have to be known at the best accuracy level.

The AC Stark shift induced by the blackbody radiation 
(BBR)  was  pointed  out  as  a  relevant  bias  for  Cs  atomic 
clocks in the early ‘80s [13] with the following relation:

 where  T  is  the  radiation  temperature  of  the  environment 
in  kelvin,  and  ν0=9192631770  Hz.  The 
expressed 
temperature  dependence  in  (1)  is  quite  general  since  it 
derives directly from the Planck and the Stefan-Boltzmann 
radiation  laws.  The  coefficients  β  and  ε  depends  on  the 
atom  and  on  the  considered  transition;  up  to  now  the 
theoretical  accepted  value  of  β  and  ε  for  133Cs  are          
β=(-1.69±0.04)x10-14 and ε=1.4x10-2. 
Experimental  determinations  of  β follow  two  different 
methods. The first one is indirect as it derives the AC Stark 
shift  from  a  measurement  of the  DC  Stark shift  produced 
by  a  static  electric  field.  This  method  has  been  used  by 
[14,15]  and  by  [16]  where  respectively  an  atomic  beam 
apparatus or a Cs fountain were used. Each of them rely on 

the application of an electric field of several kV/cm in the 
atoms  free  flight  region  between  the  two  separated 
interaction  regions  of  a  Ramsey  scheme.  The  value 
obtained  for  β  are  consistent  among  them  and  with  the 
value reported above.  

The  second  one  is  a  direct  method:  a  Cs  frequency 
standard  is  operated  at  different  temperatures  to  evaluate 
the BBR shift. Up to now, the only direct measurement is 
reported in [17] by use of a Cs thermal beam standard and 
the value obtained is β = (–1.66±0.20)x10–14, in agreement 
at 1σ with the value reported in the indirect experiments. 

In  this  Letter  we  report  the  first  direct  measurement 
of the BBR shift using a Cs fountain: the measured value 
is β = (–1.43±0.11)x10-14 in agreement at the 1σ level with 
the  direct  measurement  reported  in  [17],  but  smaller  of 
about  15%  than  the  values  deduced  by  using  indirect 
measurements [14-16]. We also report the result of a new 
theoretical evaluation of the BBR shift we have performed, 
which agrees with our experimental value. 
This  result  has  significant  implications  on  the  field  of 
precision  frequency  measurements,  as  it  involves  the  first 
element  of  the  frequency  metrology  chain,  the  primary 
standards.  In  fact,  at  room  temperature  the  difference  in 
the BBR shift evaluation with the old and the new value is 
about 3x10-15, nearly three times the accuracy declared for 
the  standards  themselves.  Moreover,  another  striking 
difference  arises  in  the  comparison  of  two  standards 
operating  at  different  temperatures:  for  example,  two  Cs 
standards  working  at  300  K  and  340  K  respectively  will 
show  a  2x10-15  difference  in  the  frequency  comparison 
while using one or the other value of β.  
 
Our atomic fountain (IEN-CSF1) was described in details 
in [4] and here we recall only the operation principle and 
some details relevant for the present experiment.  
Up to 5x107 133Cs atoms are collected and cooled down to 
~1µK in a magneto-optical trap in 0.2 s; then, after a free 
expansion time that reduces the atomic density, the cesium 
molasses is vertically launched in a ballistic flight. Atoms 
in the hyperfine ground state |F=3, mF=0> are selected by a 
combination  of  microwave  and  laser  pulses  and  then 
undergo the Ramsey interaction.

The Ramsey interaction is realized by a temperature-tuned 
microwave cavity placed along the flight trajectory where 
the atoms pass twice, first on the way up and then on the 
way  down;  exiting  the  cavity  we  detect  separately  the 
atoms  in  |F=3,  mF=0>  and  in  |F=4,  mF=0>  to  obtain  the 
transition probability.  
The cavity and the drift tube are realized in OFHC copper 
and  are  also  the  side  of  the  vacuum  chamber.  The 
temperature  of  the  fountain  structure  can  be  varied  by 
means  of  heaters.  The  state  selection  and  the  Ramsey 
interaction  take  place  inside  a  magnetically  shielded  area 
where  a  solenoid  generates  a  quantization  magnetic  field 
(C-field) along the z axes of nominal value B0~10-7 T. 
The microwave frequency is synthesized from a low phase 
noise 5 MHz BVA quartz oscillator, which is phase locked 
to a hydrogen maser. A scheme of the fountain structure is 
shown in Figure 1.

In  our  experiment  we  measure  the  frequency  of  the 
fountain with respect to that of the hydrogen maser (HM) 
used  as  reference:  the  fountain  alternatively  works  at  two 
different  temperatures  T1  and  T2  and  β  is  evaluated  from 
the  difference  of  the  two  measured  frequencies.  Indeed, 
since  every  measurement  has  about  1x10-15  uncertainty,  a 
difference  between  T1  and  T2  of  at  least  30  K  is  required 

 

around 300 K to obtain a frequency difference of about 10-
14 and an uncertainty below 10-15 for β.  
 

fountain 

four  subsets  of 

The HM frequency (drift removed) is very stable on the 
medium and long term (3x10-16 over one week) and allows 
to  compare  the  fountain  frequency  measurements  at 
different  temperatures  spreading  over  few  weeks.  A  very 
careful  estimation  of  the  HM  drift  is  a  key  point  of  the 
experiment.  For  this  purpose,  each  measurement  of  β  is 
frequency 
composed  of 
evaluations,  alternated  at  T1  and  T2  and  moreover,  every 
single subset lasts at least five days.  
The  sets  of  data  are  then  processed  by  a  multilinear  least 
squares  technique,  where  two  parallel  lines  fit  the  data  at 
T1  and  T2.  The  parallel  lines  model  uses  only  three 
parameters,  the  maser  drift  and  the    axes  intercepts.  The 
frequency  difference  between  the  atomic  fountain  in  T1 
and  T2  is  given  directly  by  the  difference  of  the  ordinate 
intercepts of the two lines as evaluated by the fit, as shown 
in  Figure  2  where  the  measured  data  in  one  run  of  the 
experiment are reported. 
In order to check the evaluation of the drift obtained by the 
fit,  we  have  compared  by  means  of  a  two  way  satellite 
time  and  frequency  transfer  (TWSTFT)  [18]  our  maser 
with the remote time scales UTC(NIST) and UTC(NPL) of 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (USA) 
and of the National Physical Laboratory (UK) respectively. 
These evaluations of the maser drift d agree with our local 
measurement d = (-9.7±0.4)x10-16/day within 1x10-16/day.

In IEN CS-F1 the Ramsey cavity is temperature-tuned 
to the Cs resonance frequency; its working point is T0=343 
K  and  it  is  not  possible  to  change  the  temperature  of  the 
drift  region  without  changing  the  cavity  temperature.  The 
experiment requires to operate the cavity out of resonance 
and then it is necessary to increase the microwave power. 
As  the  loaded  quality  factor  of  the  cavity  is  QL  ~  20000 
and the frequency/temperature sensitivity is 150 kHz/K, a 
15 K off resonance condition requires an increase of 20 dB 
of the microwave power in order to maintain the optimum 

2

level for the Ramsey spectroscopy (π/2 microwave pulse). 
This power increase could result in undesirable frequency 
shifts of the clock transition due to the presence of possible 
microwave leakage in the apparatus. We have not detected 
any  frequency  shift  at  the  1x10-15  level  in  differential 
measurements on IEN-CsF1 when operating, at resonance, 
alternatively with π/2 and 5π/2 microwave pulses.  
Furtherly, a key point of the measurement is to choose two 
different temperatures T1 and T2 (around 328 K and 358 K 
respectively)  equally  spaced  with  respect  to  the  usual 
working temperature T0. 
In  this  way,  the  differential  measurement  rejects  all  the 
unwanted  microwave  shifts,  being  the  microwave  power 
unchanged at T1 and T2. 
Another significant improvement of our measurement with 
respect  to  the  previous  one  [17]  is  that  the  Ramsey 
interaction in a fountain is performed with a single cavity, 
so no end to end phase shift effect exists. The effect of the 
cavity pulling, linear and quadratic [2], is evaluated to be 
<1x10-16. 
 
Moreover, differential determination of β allows to reach a 
type-B  uncertainty  of  5x10-16  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  the 
IEN-CSF1 accuracy is currently evaluated to be 2x10-15. In 
fact,  IEN-CSF1  accuracy  is  limited  by  the  density  shift 
evaluation, but since the average density is kept constant at 
10 % during each run of the BBR experiment, the atomic 
density shift is cancelled at the 4x10-16 level.  
Another temperature dependent effect in the experiment is 
the  Zeeman  shift:  in  fact,  the  pitch  of  the  solenoid  that 
provides  the  C-field  can  change,  resulting  in  a  different 
magnetic shift on the transition at T1 and T2, as well as it 
may  happen  if  thermoelectric  currents  are  present  in  the 
structure. We have done two C-field maps at T1 and T2 to 
evaluate  the  Zeeman  shift  in  the  two  situations  and  we 
have measured a maximum frequency difference <1x10-16. 
The  last  possible  temperature  dependent  effect  which 
could  affect  the  fountain  frequency  is  a  change  in  the 
copper  surface  outgasing  (hydrogen);  we  have  calculated 
for this effect a conservative uncertainty of 1x10-16. 
 

The fountain  structure,  even if  not originally  designed 
for  this  purpose,  is  a  very  good  black  body  radiator.  The 
cavity  and  the  drift  tube  (see  Figure  1)  are  both  realized 
with  the  same  material  (OFHC  copper)  whose  high 
thermal  conductivity  ensures  a  good  enough  temperature 
homogeneity.  Seen  from  the  inside,  from  the  atoms  point 
of  view,  the  fountain  structure  is  a  cavity  at  a  given 
temperature  with  two  very  small  holes  at  the  ends. 
Furthermore  the  window  at  the  top  end  is  made  of  BK7 
glass  and  is  extremely  dark  in  the  far-infrared  where  the 
BBR spectrum reaches its maximum (~17 THz). 
The temperature is measured by four type T thermocouples 
along  the  interaction  region,  one  on  the  cavity  body,  one 
close to the atom apogee, one 20 cm above the apogee and 
one at the fountain top on the upper window. 
Three heaters set the temperature of the environment, two 
inside the interaction region (one on the cavity and one on 
the drift tube) and one on the upper window. The heaters 
consist of a constantan wire fed by an alternated current at 
30  kHz  to  avoid  the  generation  of  a  magnetic  field  that 

could perturb the atomic sample. A servo system keeps the 
temperature  constant  within  0.04  K.  The 
typical 
temperature profiles of the structure at T1 and T2 are also 
reported  in  Figure  1.  We  observe  that  the  atoms,  in  their 
parabolic flight, spend most of the time where the radiation 
temperature is more homogeneous. 
The skin effect of the copper structure reduces strongly the 
penetration inside the interaction region of the RF current 
generated  by  the  heater.  No  AC  Zeeman  effect  was 
observed  at  the  8x10-16  level,  uncertainty  that  is  further 
reduced in the differential measurements done at the level 
of 3x10-16. 
To  calculate  the  effective  blackbody  temperature  seen  by 
the atoms we interpolate the measured temperatures with a 
polygonal  curve  and  then  we  calculate  the  average 
radiation  temperature  experimented  by  the  atoms  at  a 
given position (integrated over the solid angle); in this way 
it is possible to calculate also the effect of the two “holes” 
in the blackbody radiator, the upper window and the hole 
in  the  microwave  cavity.  The  values  obtained  at  different 
elevations  inside  the  fountain  structure  are  then  used  to 
calculate  the  time  averaged radiation  temperature  seen  by 
the atoms along their ballistic flight. 
The  effect  of  both  the  upper  and  the  lower  holes  is  very 
small,  and  the  variation  of  radiation  temperature  for  one 
degree  of  variation  of  the  hole  temperature  is  3x10-4  K/K 
in the considered temperature range. 
The  surface  emissivity  of  the  oxided  copper  reported  in 
literature varies from 0.5 to 0.88; we have calculated that 
in  our  geometrical  configuration  it  does  not  affect  the 
quality  of  the  BBR  radiator  at  the  accuracy  level  of  the 
experiment. 
The  radiation  temperature  T1  and  T2  and  the  frequency 
difference  measured  are  used  then  to  measure  the  β 
coefficient according to the formula (1). At the resolution 
level  of  our  experiment  and  with  only  two  different 
temperature points it is not possible to check the value of 
the  parameter  ε;  we  assume  for  it  the  theoretical  value  ε 
=1.4x10-2 given in [13]. 
We have measured β in three different runs; one of them is 
shown in Figure 2, while all the measurements performed 
are reported in Table I. The final weighted average value is

Our  experimental  measurement  of  the  BBR  shift  is 
compatible with the previous direct measurement [16] with 
an improved accuracy of a factor two, but is significantly 
different  from  the  usually  accepted  value.  We  have  also 
performed  a  new  theoretical  evaluation  of  the  BBR  shift 
taking into account i) the most recent physical data on the 
Cs  atom  as  regards  the  electric  dipole  moments  [19  and 
references  therein]  and  the  frequencies  of  the  D1  and  the 
D2 lines [20], which give the highest contribution to β; 
ii)  a  basis  of  modified  eigenfunctions  which  accounts  for 
the  hyperfine  interaction  of  the  S  and  P  states  with  other 
states of the same quantum  numbers F and mF as pointed 
in [21]. The result of our analysis is: β=(-1.49±0.07)x10-14 
and ε=1.4x10-2 and will be reported with more details in a 
forthcoming paper. 
The  agreement  between  our  theoretical  and  experimental 
values  is  widely  satisfactory.  Furthermore  we  notice  that 
most  of  the  recent  data  reported  in  the  literature  on  the 
polarizability  of  the  62S1/2  Cs  ground  state  [22],  obtained 
with  different  experimental  techniques,  are  lower  than 
those  obtained  with  the  DC  Stark  effect  measurements. 
Since  it  is  commonly  accepted  that  the  BBR  shift  should 
scale with polarizability, these recent data suggest that the 
coefficient β could be lower than that accepted up to now, 
in agreement with our results.  
It  is  possible  that  the  DC  Stark  effect  measurements  [14-
16],  in  agreement  among  them,  were  affected  by  some 
systematic effect due to the fact that the DC electric field 
is not applied continuously during the free flight phase of 
the Ramsey interaction but as a fast step. 

In  conclusion  we  have  reported  a  direct  measurement 
of  the  BBR  shift  of  the  133Cs  hyperfine  ground  state 
transition, firstly performed in an atomic fountain with an 
uncertainty of 1x10-15. Our experimental value agrees both 
with a theoretical re-evaluation of the BBR shift and with 
recent data on the 133Cs atomic polarizability and differs by 
about  3x10-15  from  the  commonly  accepted  value;  this 
could require to reconsider the accuracy of the Cs atomic 
frequency standards used in TAI and in some fundamental 
physical tests.

Abstract 

Continuous-wave  Raman  amplification  in  silicon  waveguides  with  negative  electrical 

power  dissipation  is  reported.  It  is  shown  that  a  p-n  junction  can  simultaneously  achieve 

carrier  sweep-out  leading  to  net  continuous-wave  gain,  and  electrical  power  generation. 

The  approach  is  also  applicable  to  silicon  Raman  lasers  and  other  third-order  nonlinear 

optical devices.

Silicon-on-Insulator  (SOI)  has  been  long  recognized  as  a  preferred  platform  for  the 

realization of both  electronic and photonic devices.1 One of the most attractive features of the 

SOI material system is the prospect of full integration of optical and electronic devices on the 

same  substrate.  Much  progress  has  been  made  in  Si-based  photonics  towards  low-loss 

waveguides,  photodetectors,  electro-optic  modulators,  light  sources  and  optical  amplifiers.2 

However, little or no attention has been made to the power dissipation of photonic devices. At 

the same time, the problem of power dissipation in silicon VLSI is so severe that it threatens to 

bring to halt the continued advance of the technology, as described by the Moore(cid:146)s law.3 This 

fact  is  highlighted  by  the  recent  momentous  shift  of  the  microprocessor  industry  away  from 

increasing the clock speed and in favor of multi-core processors.4 Evidently, realization of low-

power silicon photonic devices is essential for opto-electronic integration.  

Typically,  lasers  are  the  most  power-hungry  photonic  devices.  However,  the  lack  of  an 

electrically-pumped Si laser, to the date, dictates an architecture where the light source remains 

off-chip.  In  such  architecture,  an  off-chip  source  empowers  the  chip,  whereas  modulators, 

amplifiers,  photodetectors,  and  perhaps  wavelength  converters,  are  integrated  on  the  chip. 

Among these devices the optical amplifier has the highest power dissipation. To the date, Raman 

amplification has been the most successful approach for achieving both amplification and lasing 

in  silicon.5-12  The  main  limitation  of  the  silicon Raman  amplifier  is  the  optical  loss  caused  by 

scattering from free carriers that are generated when the high intensity pump causes two photon 

absorption (TPA).10,13  To achieve net continuous-wave gain, a reverse biased p-n junction can 

be used to sweep the carriers out of the waveguide core.10-13 However, this comes at the expense 

of significant electrical power dissipation.14 The present work addresses this power dissipation 

in silicon Raman amplifiers. It is shown that at moderate gain levels, it is not only possible to 

 

2 

avoid  the  power  dissipation,  but  also  to  extract  net  electrical  power  from  the  device.  The  net 

electrical  power  generation  is  achieved  by  operating  a  p-n  junction  diode,  which  straddles  the 

waveguide, in the  fourth quadrant of its current-voltage  (I-V) characteristics.  In this mode, the 

TPA-generated carriers are swept out by the built-in field of the junction, yet the device delivers 

electrical power. The concept becomes clear if one considers the device  as a nonlinear optical 

equivalent of a solar cell. 

A schematic of the device is shown in Fig. 1. Devices were fabricated by standard optical 

lithography,  dry  etching,  dopant  implantation,  passivation,  and  metallization  techniques. 

Different variations of waveguide widths (W =1.5 to 3.0  m) and spacing between doped region 

wells  and  ridge  edges  (d  =1.6  to  2.8  m)  were  obtained.    Laterally-tapered  mode-converters 

were fabricated in order to decrease the coupling loss into and out of the waveguides. The facets 

were polished but left uncoated.  The best experimental results, presented in the  following, are 

for  3-cm  long  waveguides  (including  the  tapers)  with  W=1.5  m  and  d=2  m.    A  linear 

propagation loss of ~0.5 dB/cm is measured in these waveguide using the Fabry-Perot technique. 

The pump laser is a New Focus external-cavity tunable diode at 1539 nm with a linewidth 

of 0.1-0.2 nm amplified with an EDFA. The Stokes signal is a 1673 nm DFB laser biased at an 

output power of ~4.5 mW. The pump and Stokes beams are coupled in and out of the waveguide 

with  two  identical  objective  lenses  (M=20X,  0.40  NA),  after  combining  the  two  beams  in  a 

wavelength  division  multiplexing  coupler.  Also,  a  5/95%  tap  coupler  is  incorporated  into  the 

pump optical path to measure its power. The electrical loop that biases the diode consists of a 

power  supply,  a  1  kW

  series  resistor  and  a  current  meter.  Unlike  previous  reports  by  us  and 

others,11,12,15 no thermoelectric cooler was required to stabilize the device temperature.

Figure 2 presents the measured on-off Raman gain at different coupled pump powers and 

biasing  conditions.  Although  TPA  of  the  pump  power  is  not  a  major  detriment  by  itself,10  the 

generated  free  carriers  increase  the  loss  substantially,  preventing  Raman  gain  in  silicon 

waveguides.13 This is in agreement with the optical loss observed in Fig. 2 for an open-circuit p-

i-n junction. When a reverse bias is applied, the induced electric field removes the TPA-induced 

free  carriers  from  the  waveguide  region,  hence  reducing  the  carrier  effective  lifetimes.  A 

maximum on-off gain of ~4 dB is obtained at a reverse bias of 15 V. Considering the measured 

linear loss of 0.5 dB/cm, the highest achievable net Raman gain is thus ~2.5 dB in the 3-cm long 

device.  Higher  reverse  voltages  do  not  increase  the  gain  considerably,  which  may  be  due  to 

saturation of the drift velocity. This argument is supported by the fact that for a p- and n-well 

separation of 5.3  m in the device, the average electric field at 15 V is equal to the peak electric 

field value of ~3Â· 104 V/cm in silicon. It is also observed that an on-off Raman gain of 2.7 dB is 

attained when the diode is short-circuit (0 V).  This corresponds to a net Raman gain of ~1.2 dB, 

which  is  higher  than  our  previous  report  at  zero  bias  where  no  lateral  mode-converting  tapers 

was involved.15 

As  seen  in  Fig.  2,  on-off  Raman  gains  as  high  as  2  dB  is  measured  when  the  device  is 

forward-biased  at  voltages  0.7  V.  The  importance  of  this  biasing  regime  is  that  power 

dissipation  is  negative.  Figure  3  shows  the  generated  power  for  biases  of  0.6  and  0.7  V  at 

different  pump  intensities,  extracted  from  the  measured  current  and  voltage  drop  across  the 

diode.  The  TPA-induced  photovoltaic  effect  is  also  clearly  evident  in  the  measured  I-V 

characteristics presented in Fig. 4. The attenuated pump intensity via TPA creates free carriers in 

the SOI waveguide. The collected photogenerated carriers contribute to a current component that 

 

4 

delivers  electrical  power  to  the  external  circuitry.  Therefore,  the  sweep-out  of  TPA  generated 

free carriers can be exploited to generate electrical power. 

Sweep-out  of  carriers  and  reduction  of  the  effective  lifetime  has  been  the  motivation  for 

utilizing  a  reverse-biased  p-n  junction  in  Raman  amplifiers.10-13  The  forward-bias  employed  in 

the present work might seem counterintuitive. However, it should be reminded that reduction of 

the effective lifetime can be achieved as long as the diode current is negative. In other words, a 

negative voltage is not a prerequisite for carrier sweep-out. We conducted 2-D numerical drift-

diffusion  simulations  on  structures  identical  to  the  fabricated  devices  using  ATLAS  (from 

Silvaco  International),  according  to  a  methodology  described  elsewhere.14  It  was  verified  that 

the effective lifetime of biases in the fourth quadrant is about one order of magnitude lower than 

the open-circuit value. Therefore, collection of photogenerated carriers in the fourth quadrant of 

the  I-V  characteristics  by  the  built-in  field  can  sufficiently  decreases  the  free  carrier  loss  and 

results in CW optical gain. 

We  now  discuss  the  main  limitation  of  the  proposed  approach.  At  very  high  optical 

intensities, the built-in field of the junction is insufficient to remove the  high density of  TPA-

generated carriers. In such cases, a reverse bias needs to be applied to increase the field resulting 

in positive electrical power dissipation. Therefore, there exists a tradeoff between the amount of 

gain (and hence output power) and the electrical power generation/dissipation.  

Finally,  high  pump  intensities,  and  hence  TPA,  are  also  encountered  in  other  silicon 

photonic devices that operate based on third-order nonlinear effects such as Raman lasers9,12 as 

well as in Raman and Kerr-based wavelength converters.16-18 Hence, the present approach is also 

applicable in these devices.  

In  conclusion,  two  photon  absorption  and  the  resulting  free  carrier  scattering  are 

 

5 

omnipresent  problems  in  silicon  photonic  devices  that  operate  based  on  nonlinear  optical 

interactions. It is shown that active removal of these carriers can be achieved while generating 

modest amount of electrical power.

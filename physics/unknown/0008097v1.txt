Abstract

Recently,  the  Low-Energy  Demonstration  Accelerator
(LEDA) portion of the Accelerator Production of Tritium
(APT)  project  reached  its  100-mA,  8-hr  CW  beam
operation  milestone.  LEDA  consists  of  a  75-keV  proton
injector,  6.7-MeV,  350-MHz  CW 
radio-frequency
quadrupole  (RFQ)  with  associated  high-power  and  low-
level  rf  systems,  a  short  high-energy  beam  transport
(HEBT)  and  high-power  (670-kW  CW)  beam  dump.
During  the  commissioning  phase  it  was  discovered  that
the  RFQ  field  level  must  to  be  approximately  5-10%
higher than design in order to accelerate the full 100-mA
beam with low losses. Measurements of a low-duty-factor,
100-mA  beam 
is
unexpectedly low for RFQ  field  levels  between  ~90  and
105% of design. This paper will describe some aspects of
LEDA  operations  critical

1  INTRODUCTION

The  LEDA  RFQ  is  an  8-m-long  linac  that  delivers  a
6.7-MeV,  100-mA  CW  proton  beam.  The  RFQ  and  its
various ancillary systems (Fig. 1)  are  described  in  detail
elsewhere [1-6].  We  recently  completed 
the  beam-
commissioning phase where we accomplished our goal of
8-hr, 100-mA, CW beam operation. During the coarse of
commissioning 
the  RFQ,  we  observed  an  overall

2  LEDA PERFORMANCE

From  mid-Nov ’99  through  early  Apr ’00,  LEDA  was
operated with beam currents in excess of 90 mA and duty
factors ≥99.7%. During this time, while operating at duty
factors ≥99.7%, LEDA accumulated 9.0 hr of ≥99.7 mA,
20.7  hr  of  ≥99 mA  and  111 hr  of  ≥90 mA  beam.  The
beam-current monitors were  sampled  at  30-sec  intervals.
In the analysis, a run was defined as a contiguous set of
samples with the beam current ≥5 mA and the duty factor
≥99.7%. To aid in monitoring beam transmission through
the RFQ, the duty factor was reduced from CW to 99.7%
to  allow  accurate  measurement  of  the  RFQ  input  and
output beam using the AC current monitors at the entrance
and exit of the RFQ. These data are included in the CW
analysis.  The  longest  run  at  greater  then  90  mA  was
118 min at 99.3 mA. We accumulated a total of 694 runs
with an average duration of 9.6 min each. A histogram of
run duration statistics is shown in Fig. 2.

During the commissioning phase, the following aspects
of  either  LEDA  hardware  configuration  or  operations
were critical to achieving the 100-mA milestone:

•  LEBT beam properly matched to the RFQ. Space-
charge  effects  were  overcome  through  addition  of
an  electron-trap  at  the  RFQ  entrance  and  by
reduction  of 
to  RFQ
distance [1].

•  RFQ field quality. Monitored at 64 locations along
structure  and  optimized  through  adjustment  of
cooling flows on the four 2-m RFQ segments.

•  Resonance  Control  Cooling  System  performance.
PID  control  parameters  were  adjusted  for  fast
transient 
response  during  high-power  beam
operation.

•  Low operating pressure in RFQ. Pressure ~1.x10–7

 Torr for stable operation.

3  RFQ BEAM TRANSMISSION

3.1  Initial Observation

in 

Early  on 

the  commissioning  phase,  an  RFQ
transmission  curve  first  revealed  a  discrepancy  between
actual  and  expected  beam  transmission  at  high  peak
currents.  Subsequently  a  series  of  measurements  were
made to examine the transmission for various peak current
beams  from  70-100 mA.  The  measurement  results  along
with  a  PARMTEQM [7]  prediction  for  the  nominal
100 mA  beam  are  shown  in  Fig.  3.  All  transmission
measurements were performed with low duty factor beam
to  limit  the  total  beam  loss.  A  substantial  peak-current-
dependent  reduction  in  transmission  was  observed.  This
reduction in transmission for the 100mA beam ultimately
dictated  a  higher  operating  field  level  for  the  RFQ,  i.e.
field levels ~5-10% above design.
3.2  Simulations

In an attempt to understand the loss of transmission at
higher 
PARMTEQM
calculations  were  performed  to  investigate  the  effects  of
varying  degrees  of  RFQ  field  tilt,  beam  mismatch,
position and angle offsets to the beam, and beam current
enhancement  on  RFQ  beam  transmission.  None  of  the
above results were able to reproduce the observed loss of
transmission.  Initially,  simulations  were  performed  with
field tilts up to 10%. These results did not reproduce the
measurements. Also, these large tilts were not  consistent
with  our  observations.  (Quadrupole  and  dipole  field
distributions were derived from cavity signals sampled at
64  locations  along  the  RFQ.)  Introducing  mismatched

beam into  the  RFQ  reduced  the  overall  transmission  but
nothing  more.  The  code  was  then  modified  to  allow  for
small  displacements  to  be  applied  to  the  particles
transverse coordinates at a given cell. This was an attempt
to approximate small misalignments between segments of
the  RFQ  and  small  dipole  field  contributions  from  the
RFQ.  These  results  did  not  reproduce  the  transmission
curves. The code was further modified to allow the beam
current in a bunch to be enhanced. This was an attempt to
mimic  background  charges  that  might  possibly  become
trapped  within  the  RFQ  acceleration  channel.  In  all  the
above studies, the character of the predicted transmission
curves was basically unchanged. The precipitous drop in
transmission  has  not  been  reproduced  by  any  of  these
calculations.
3.3  Additional Observations

Further  measurements  revealed  several 

interesting
features. Time dependence in the loss of transmission was
seen while making measurements using short beam pulses
at  reduced  RFQ  field  strengths.  We  observed  a  step-
change reduction in the beam current out of the RFQ  as
shown in Fig. 4. The leading portion of the pulse exhibits
transmission characteristics in agreement with simulation
for  the  nominal  RFQ,  the  trailing  edge  does  not.
Simultaneous measurements of the cavity field amplitude
sampled  along  the  downstream  portion  of  the  RFQ
revealed a small but measurable increase in the RFQ field
level  correlated  with  the  decrease  in  beam  transmission,
also shown in Fig. 4. During this transition, the low-level
RF  system  maintained  a  constant  drive  signal.  The  RFQ
field  amplitude  at  the  end  of  the  pulse  was  observed  to
increase exponentially towards the end of the RFQ. This
would be consistent with a reduction in beam loading, i.e.
increase  in  beam  loss,  which  would  result  in  net  higher
fields.  The  beam  loss  would  also  be  consistent  with
observed  high  radio-activation  levels  at  the  high-energy

end  of  the  RFQ  when  it  is  operated  at  or  below  design
field levels. We also observed that the temporal location
of the transition depends upon the RFQ field level. As the
field  is  reduced  the  start  of  the  transition  shifts  towards
the beginning of the pulse. Also, no difference was seen in
transmission  curves  obtained  using  90-mA  beam  under
CW and low duty factor(~25%) RF operation.

Changes  in  the  wire  scanner  profiles  were  also  seen
across  a  beam  pulse  containing  the  transition.  The
centroid and rms width of both the horizontal and vertical
profiles  were  constant  during  the  leading  edge  of  the
pulse.  However,  during  the  trailing  edge  as  much  as  a
100% increase in the rms size of the vertical profile was
seen as the field level in the RFQ was reduced from 10%
above  to  10%  below  design.  Over  that  same  field
amplitude  range  a  small  change  was  observed  for  the
horizontal  rms  size  while  no  change  was  observed  in
either centroid.
3.4  One possible explanation

The  observed  reduction  in  transmission  might  well  be
due to ions trapped within the RFQ accelerating channel.
The  potential  well  established  in  the  RFQ  is  capable  of
trapping slow moving ions [8]. These ions would increase
the  effective  space-charge  force  seen  by  the  beam  and
could result in a larger overall beam that could be lost on
the RFQ vanes. The source of ions, e.g. protons, might be
beam collisions with either residual gas molecules or the
RFQ  vane  tips.  The  observed  time  dependence  in  the
output beam current would be related to the ion  buildup
rate.  Previous  simulations  with  PARMTEQM  may  have
been to simplistic. A further study was performed where
PARMTEQM was modified to pre-load the space-charge
mesh  with  additional  charge.  Very  preliminary  results
showed a background charge distribution could produce a
larger, somewhat hollow beam. Transmission calculations

have not yet been performed with this code. However, a
steady state, single-bunch code  like  PARMTEQM  might
not  be  appropriate  for  modeling  this  time  dependent
phenomenon.  Along  this  line,  work  has  begun  on
developing a simple model of the RFQ using time as the
independent 
like
TOUTATIS [9]  might  also  be  more  appropriate  for  this
study. More work needs to be done in this area.

4  SUMMARY

The LEDA RFQ has performed well: it operated for 21
hr  with  RFQ  output  currents  ≥99 mA  during  the  recent
beam-commissioning period. An unexpected reduction in
high-peak  current  (>70mA)  beam 
transmission  was
observed  when  the  RFQ  field  levels  were  operated
between  ~90  and  105%  of  design.  Further  investigation
revealed  a

profiles  and  RFQ  field  levels.  Trapped  ions  in  the  RFQ
channel is one possible explanation for the effect.

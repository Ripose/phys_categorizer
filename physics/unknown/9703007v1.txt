FOUNDATIONS OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND THEORY
OF PHASE TRANSITIONS

Abstract. A new formulation of statistical mechanics is put forward ac-
cording to which a random variable characterizing a macroscopic body is
postulated to be inﬁnitely divisible. It leads to a parametric representation of
partition function of an arbitrary macroscopic body, a possibility to describe a
macroscopic body under excitation by a gas of some elementary quasiparticles
etc. A phase transition is deﬁned as such a state of a macroscopic body
that its random variable is stable in sense of L´evy. From this deﬁnition it
follows by deduction all general properties of phase transitions: existence of the
renormalization semigroup, the singularity classiﬁcation for thermodynamic
functions, the phase transition universality and universality classes. On this
basis we has also built a 2-parameter scaling theory of phase transitions, a
thermodynamic function for the Ising model etc.

Introduction

A creation of phase transition theory is one of the most important problem of
statistical mechanics. While we have reached big success last years we have no still
solution of the problem[16], [19].

In this paper we propose a new approach to this problem which is based on
analysis of a random variable characterizing a macroscopic body. According to
traditional exposition of statistical mechanics this random variable is to be a me-
chanical additive integral of motion. Generalizing this statement we postulate
that random variables in statistical mechanics must be inﬁnitely divisible. Using a
canonical representation by L´evy–Khintchine for a characteristic function of inﬁnite
divisible random variable we have got a parametric representation of partition

function of any macroscopic body and therefore a possibility to analyze its ther-
modynamic properties. Since a generalized Poisson random variable, which from
physical point of view is nothing else than the Boltzmann ideal gas random variable,
can approximate inﬁnite divisible random variable as good as we wish we can
explain why it is possible to imagine any excited macroscopic body as a gas of
some quasiparticles or elementary excitations. A general representation of a set of
random variables characterizing macroscopic bodies in statistical mechanics follows
from the fact that a set of inﬁnite divisible random variables is a convex set having
the normal and Poisson random variables as extreme points.

Analysis of modern physical representations on a nature of phase transitions
leads to an idea that the phase transition is such a state of a macroscopic body
that its random variable is stable in sense of L´evy. Taking this as a deﬁnition
we has become able to deduce all well known properties of phase transitions.
The stability property itself uses in its deﬁnition as a matter of fact a notion
of renormalization semigroup which is well familiar in statistical mechanics. A
number of ﬁnite moments for a stable random variable or, which is the same, a
number of ﬁnite derivatives of a partition function for a macroscopic body, is no
more than the so called characteristic exponent α, 0 < α < 2, which plays role of
a critical index for the phase transition. It means that in the nature there exist
phase transitions only of the ﬁrst and second order. Using a notion of attraction
domain for the stable random variable we has been able to explain a meaning of a
phase transition universality and deﬁne universality classes. Distribution functions
of random variables describing macroscopic bodies in a region of phase transition
are appeared to be also universal and are expressed in terms of the Fox functions.
We have applied the above theory to a case when macroscopic body is characte-
rized by a 2-dimensional random variable (e.g. an energy, an order parameter). We
have succeed to reproduce all results of a 2-parametric scaling theory and express
all critical indexes in terms of appropriate characteristic exponents. In a case when
one of characteristic exponents is equal to 1 the theory leads to well known results
of the exactly solvable Ising model with ﬁeld.

The paper is organized as follows. In chapter 1 we postulate that the random
variable characterizing any macroscopic body is inﬁnite divisible and consider dif-
ferent consequences of this postulate. In chapter 2 we give the deﬁnition of phase
transition and then reproduce all characteristic properties of phase transitions at
ﬁrst for an elementary case of the 1-dimensional random variable and further for
a more general case of the many-dimensional random variable. In chapter 3 we
consider an example of application of general theory to a particular case of 2-
dimensional random variable and as a result deduce a 2-parametric scaling theory
of phase transitions. At last we conclude the paper with some remarks about
general meaning of our results.

1. Infinitely divisible random variable describes macroscopic body in

statistical mechanics

A statistical mechanics studies the properties of macroscopic bodies which con-
sist, according to deﬁnition, of an immense number (e.g. the Avogadro number) of
some identical particles (e.g. atoms, molecules). As result of that the main laws
of statistical mechanics are laws of a collective, a crowd and every macroscopic
body is described by a random variable. The random variable X is certainly to be

FOUNDATIONS OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND THEORY OF PHASE TRANSITIONS 3

additive and an appropriate probability measure µ(x) is surely to be multiplicative
relative to a convolution ∗, i.e. if we divide a macroscopic body into n independent
subbodies then

(1.1)

(1.2)

X = X1 + · · · + Xn,
µ(x) = µ(x1) ∗ · · · ∗ µ(xn).

The described above scheme of partition and successive construction of a macrosco-
pic body out of its subparts (we call it the algorithm of Democrites of Abdera) is
used constantly in statistical mechanics. Of course we suppose that such a partition
is possible for every positive integer n. It means that a following postulate is valid:
a random variable corresponding to a macroscopic body is inﬁnitely divisible.
This postulate generalizes and takes place of a similar statement used in the
traditional exposition of statistical mechanics due to Gibbs according to which the
random variable of macroscopic body must be a mechanical additive integral of
motion. We consider this replacement reasonable since in our opinion we have
to formulate the general principles of statistical mechanics without any reference
to other parts of physics (e.g. the classical or quantum mechanics).
In essence
this postulate means that if the atom or molecule dimensions are negligible we
may apply the Democrites algorithm of decomposition of a macroscopic body into
subbodies endlessly.

We can formulate this postulate as

Deﬁnition 1. A macroscopic body in statistical mechanics is the physical structure
which is described by an inﬁnitely divisible random variable.

Further we are going to study random variables taking values in Rk. We shall
consider every random variable to be full i.e. we shall suppose that a support of an
appropriate probability measure do not belongs to a proper hyperplane of Rk. By
changing an origin of coordinates and a unit of measurement we undergo a random
variable X to an aﬃne transformation X 7→ AX + b, where A is a nondegenerate
linear transformation and b is a vector. Random variables are said to be of the
same type if they are connected by an aﬃne transformation. Since this relation is
reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive a set of random variables is divided into mutually
disjoint types.

A probability measure of a macroscopic body is known to have such a form

(Gibbs, J.W., 1902) [6]

(1.3)

µ(dx) = Z −1(u) exp(− < u, x >)D(x)dx,

where < u, x > is a linear functional on a space of random variables, D(x) is a
density of states of the macroscopic body for a given value x of a random variable
and

(1.4)

Z(u) =

exp(− < u, x >)D(x)dx

is a partition function.

Z

A logarithm of a partition function is well known to be a generating function
for cumulants of the random variable and besides of that deﬁnes thermodynamic
functions of the macroscopic body. If for example the additive random variable is
an energy then

(1.5)

F (u) = −u−1 ln Z(u)

4

E.D. BELOKOLOS

is the Helmholtz free energy and u−1 is a temperature.

Since it is better to describe properties of inﬁnitely divisible random variables in
the language of characteristic functions we state ﬁrst of all a connection between
the characteristic function

(1.6)

ˆµ(y) = M exp(ihy, xi) =

exp(ihy, xi)µ(dx)

and the partition function Z(u).

Lemma 1.1.

Z

(1.7)

ln ˆµ(y, u) = lnZ(u − iy) − lnZ(u).

Proof. Proof consists of substitution of the expression for macroscopic body pro-
bability measure (1.3) in the deﬁnition of characteristic function (1.6).

It follows from the lemma that the characteristic function ˆµ(y, u) after analytical

continuation in the variable y to the complex space Ck has such an expression

(1.8)

ln ˆµ(iv, a) = ln Z(u + v) − ln Z(u).

If we do not want to use results of the traditional approach to statistical mecha-
nics we should consider the lemma and therefore the formula (1.8) as a postulate.
According to L´evy P. and Khintchine A.J. [8] the logarithm of characteristic

function of an inﬁnitely divisible random variable has such a canonical form

ln ˆµ(y) = ihy, ai − (1/2)hy, Ryi +

The canonical form of the logarithm of characteristic function for the inﬁnitely
divisible random variable is valid under analytical continuation in the variable y
to any containing the point 0 convex tubular domain G ⊂ Ck and an appropriate
integral in this formula converges absolutely and uniformly in any compact K ⊂ G.
Let us remind to this end that the domain G ⊂ Ck is named as the tubular one
with base B ⊂ Rk if it is of the form

Now we can prove a following

G = {z ∈ Ck|ℑz ∈ B}.

where a ∈ Rk, R is symmetric non-negative bounded operator in Rk and M is a
L´evy measure.

Proof. It follows from formulae (1.8) and (1.9).

This parametric expression for the logarithm of partition function of macroscopic
body (and therefore for its thermodynamic functions) must be of extreme impor-
tance in statistical mechanics.
It is obvious that diﬀerent classes of parameters
must describe diﬀerent classes of macroscopic bodies and even diﬀerent classes of
microscopic theories that lay in their foundations. Let us remind in this connection
that the quantum mechanics has appeared for the ﬁrst time as a new kind of
distributions for a special case of a black radiation. In next section of the paper
we use the canonical representation of partition function in order to build up the
phase transition theory.

An inﬁnite divisibility of random variable characterizing a macroscopic body
is tightly connected to a scheme of decomposition of the macroscopic body into
independent subbodies. Let us consider to this end a sequence of decompositions of
the macroscopic body into subbodies when at a step n we partition the body into
k(n) subbodies and denote a random variable of the j–th subbody as Xn,j, 1 ≤ j ≤
k(n). Thus we get a sequence of series of independent random variables Xn,j, 1 ≤
j ≤ k(n). Further we shall suppose these random variables Xn,j, 1 ≤ j ≤ k(n) to
be inﬁnitely small, i.e. for any ǫ > 0 such a condition will be valid:

(1.12)

lim
n→∞

sup
1≤j≤k(n)

P {|Xn,j| > ǫ} = 0

Then a limit distribution of a sum

Sn =

Xn,j

k(n)

j=1
X

exists if and only if the random variable is inﬁnitely divisible.

Let us discuss now a physical interpretation for some classes of inﬁnitely divisible

random variables.

A random variable with normal distribution is well known to be inﬁnitely divisib-
le. It appears as a limit in the sequences of series of independent random variables
when and only when for any ǫ > 0 is valid a stronger condition

(1.13)

P {|Xn,j| > ǫ} = 0

lim
n→∞

k(n)

j=1
X

We designate conditions (1.12) and (1.13) as the conditions of weak and strong
ﬂuctuations appropriately. Using this terminology we may state that the random
variables with normal distribution should characterize weak ﬂuctuations of the
thermodynamic quantities in a universal way. This is indeed the case in statistical
mechanics.

A random variable with generalized Poisson distribution is also known to be

inﬁnitely divisible. A probability measure for this case has the following form

(1.14)

µ = exp

−ν(Rk)

ν∗n/n!,

∞

n=0
X

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

where ν means some single-particle measure. In physics we denote the generalized
Poisson distribution as the Boltzmann distribution which describes an ideal gas of

6

E.D. BELOKOLOS

non-interacting particles of classical mechanics. We should remark here that the
factor n! in this formula needs special explanation in a traditional derivation of the
Boltzmann distribution from the Gibbs one by a necessity to take in account the
identity of particles or to ensure the additivity of thermodynamic functions.
In
our approach all these properties follows from the inﬁnite divisibility of the Poisson
distribution.

Let us consider now some consequences of the inﬁnite divisibility of random

variables which characterize macroscopic bodies in statistical mechanics.

First of all we should stress a fundamental importance of the Poisson distributions
in a theory of inﬁnitely divisible distributions: any inﬁnitely divisible distribution
is a limit of the Poisson distributions. This remarkable property of the Poisson
distributions means that a following theorem is valid.
Theorem 1.3. Any excitation of macroscopic body is possible to present as an ideal
gas of some elementary excitations or quasiparticles with properties depending on
a type of the macroscopic body.

Thus we can give for the ﬁrst time a natural explanation of the fact well known
in physics on an existence in macroscopic bodies diﬀerent kinds of quasiparticles
such as phonons, plasmons, excitons, polarons, magnons etc. This fact as we have
seen is just a simple consequence of the inﬁnite divisibility of a random variable
characterizing a macroscopic body.

Of course if we need to use the quantum mechanics in order to describe physical
properties of a macroscopic body we must change the Poisson distribution by the
Bose and Fermi distributions which are also inﬁnitely divisible as it easy to show.
According to the canonical representation (1.9) a set of inﬁnitely divisible pro-
bability measures is a convex hull of the normal and Poisson measures (Johanssen,
S. 1966) [10]. This mathematical fact is based on a fundamental theorem by Krein
M.G., Milman D.P. [14] and has also remarkable physical interpretation: probabi-
lity measures of macroscopic bodies form a convex hull of the probability measures
of ﬂuctuations and ideal gases.

Thus in this section we has given a new formulation of the statistical mechanics
which is based on the inﬁnite divisibility of random variables that characterize
macroscopic bodies. In a frame of our approach we do not need to use any notions
of microscopic theories such as e.g. the hamiltonian, moreover our approach form
natural external bounds for any possible microscopic theories. We have been able
to wright down the partition function for any macroscopic body and explain a
possibility to describe any excitation of it by an ideal gas of some quasiparticles. It
seems that new formulation is simpler and deeper than usual one and more eﬀective
especially in studies of general questions of statistical mechanics. We demonstrate
it in the next section.

2. Stable random variable describes macroscopic body in a state of

phase transition.

We have shown above that a random variable of any macroscopic body is inﬁnite
divisible. Changing the parameter u ∈ Rk we can change essentially properties of
the random variable although it continues to be inﬁnitely divisible all the time. In
particular this random variable can become stable in sense of L´evy, P. (L´evy, P.
1924) [15]. Analyzing the modern physical representations on phase transitions we
have come to a conclusion that the following deﬁnition is valid.

FOUNDATIONS OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND THEORY OF PHASE TRANSITIONS 7

Deﬁnition 2. The phase transition is such a state of macroscopic body when the
appropriate random variable is stable.

From this deﬁnition we deduce further all well known basic properties of phase
transitions. But at ﬁrst in order to make our exposition as simple as possible and
concentrate on main ideas of the work we consider the case k = 1, i.e. we shall
suppose that all random variables under consideration take their values in R.

. Renormalization semigroup.
A stability of the random variable characterizing a macroscopic body under phase
transition means the following: if we split the macroscopic body into n subbodies
with independent and equally distributed random variables Xk, 1 ≤ k ≤ n then we
can ﬁnd always such real numbers an > 0 and bn that

(2.15)

Xk = anX + bn.

n

Xk=1

Here the symbol = means an equality of random variables in their distributions. It
follows easily from this equality that

an = n1/α,

0 < α ≤ 2.

A quantity α is usually called the characteristic exponent of a stable random
variable. If α = 0 then the appropriate random variable X is degenerate i.e.
it
takes with a probability 1 only one value. If α = 2 then the random variable has
normal distribution. A stable random variable X is called strictly stable if bn = 0.
If a stable random variable X has the characteristic exponent α 6= 1 then there
exists such a constant c that the random variable X − c is strictly stable.

The condition (2.15) which characterizes the stability property of a random va-
riable is deﬁned only for natural numbers n but we can generalize it easily to all
real positive numbers t. Being expressed in terms of a probability measure µ the
stability condition (2.15) takes such a form:

(2.16)

µt = t1/αµ ∗ δ(bt),

t > 0.

Here the measure µt means the t-th convolution power of the measure µ, the
measure t1/αµ means the probability measure for the random variable t1/αX, i.e.
t1/αµ(E) = µ(t−1/αE) for any Borel set E, and δ(b) means the Dirac measure in a
point b.

According to the deﬁnition (2.16) a stable probability measure is invariant under
a transformation semigroup with elements consisting of a convolution power of the
measure and a subsequent its aﬃne transformation. We designate this semigroup
as the renormalization one since it is a proper mathematical generalization of
that used now widely in a modern theory of phase transitions [16], [19]. Thus
the stability of a probability measure for a case of phase transition means just
its invariance with respect to the renormalization semigroup. In other words the
probability measure under phase transition is a ﬁxed point of the renormalization
semigroup transformations. We want to emphasize here that we have introduced
the notion of renormalization semigroup without any reference to the order of phase
transition and therefore it is valid for any type of transition. And it is very essential
diﬀerence of our renormalization semigroup and that used now in the theory of
phase transition.

A principal characteristic of a stable probability measure is the characteristic
If α = 2 then the stable measure is normal and therefore it has
exponent α.
moments of all order. If 0 < α < 2 then the stable measure has ﬁnite moments
only of the order δ where 0 < δ < α. The existence of moments of the order δ
is known to lead to the existence of derivatives of the order δ for the logarithm of
characteristic function what is equivalent according to the lemma proven above to
the existence of derivatives of the order δ for the logarithm of partition function or
the thermodynamic function of the macroscopic body. Thus these arguments proves
that the thermodynamic functions of macroscopic body under phase transition
have derivatives only of the order δ where 0 < δ < α and the characteristic
exponent α plays role of the critical index for the phase transition. Moreover the
thermodynamic functions may have only the power singularities if the characteristic
exponent 0 < α < 2, α 6= 1 and may have only the logarithmic singularity if α = 1.
We can formulate these arguments more precise.

Theorem 2.1. The logarithm of partition function under phase transition has
singularities of such a type:
α 6= 1

for 0 < α < 2,

ln Z(u + v) − ln Z(u) = c1αΓ(−α)vα,
= c2αΓ(−α)|v|α;

v > 0

v < 0

for α = 1

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)
(2.20)

(2.21)

(2.22)

ln Z(u + v) − ln Z(u) = c1v ln v,

v > 0

= c2|v| ln |v|,

v < 0.

Proof. After substitution of the canonical expression for inﬁnitely divisible random
variable (1.9) in the stability condition (2.16) it is easy to prove that the inﬁnitely
divisible random variable is stable if and only if its L´evy measure M in the canonical
expression has such a form:

M (x) = −c1x−α,

x > 0

= c2(−x)−α,

x < 0,

where c1 > 0, c2 > 0, 0 < α < 2.

It means that the logarithm of characteristic function of the stable random

variable is a sum of the Fourier transformation

Let us take ℑz = ±|v| in accordance with ℑz > 0, ℑz < 0. At last using the

lemma established earlier we prove the statement of the theorem.

According to our theorem the logarithm of partition function is continuous
function of a parameter v. If 0 < α < 1 then the ﬁrst derivative of the logarithm
of partition function has a power singularity vα−1.
If 1 < α < 2 then the ﬁrst
derivative of the logarithm of partition function is continuous but the second one
has a power singularity vα−2. In statistical mechanics we call a phase transition
of the n-th order if the ﬁrst n − 1 derivatives of a thermodynamic function are
ﬁnite but the n-th derivative is singular (Ehrenfest, P. 1933)[2]. In accordance with
this classiﬁcation of phase transitions a range of characteristic exponents 0 < α < 1
corresponds to phase transitions of the ﬁrst order and a range 1 < α < 2 corresponds
to phase transitions of the second order. If α = 1 then the ﬁrst derivative of the
logarithm of partition function has a singularity which is a sum of a jump and a
logarithmic singularity and the second derivative has a power singularity v−1. We
may designate the last type of phase transitions as the λ-point. According to our
theory there are no any phase transitions of the order more than 2.

Phase transitions of the ﬁrst and second order diﬀer substantially not only
quantitatively by the value of their characteristic exponents α but also qualitatively.
According to the probability theory a contribution to the sum of random variables
X1+. . .+Xn appearing in the stability condition (2.15) is due to only one summand
provided that 0 < α < 1 and is due to all summands equally provided that
1 < α < 2 (see for example [4]). This mathematical result corresponds to the
point of view generally accepted in physics according to which a phase transition
of the ﬁrst order is the result of local germs appearing by ﬂuctuations and a phase
transition of the second order takes place at once in a whole volume of macroscopic
body.

In general situation we can not predict what order of phase transition should be.
We have only one exception: if a random variable characterizing the macroscopic
body is bounded then the phase transition is necessarily of the ﬁrst order. In fact

10

E.D. BELOKOLOS

a stable random variable X with parameters

α and β =

c1 − c2
c1 + c2

is bounded from the left (from the right) if and only if β = 1(β = −1) and 0 < α < 1
(Esseen, C.–G. 1965)[3].
In this connection we should remark that an inﬁnite
divisible random variable may not be bounded from two sides because otherwise it
becomes degenerated.

. Universality of phase transitions. Universality classes.
The thermodynamic function of nacroscopic body depends in a general state
according to Theorem 1.2 on real numbers a, R and a L´evy spectral measure M
and in a state of phase transition according to Theorem 2.1 only on four real
numbers α, c1, c2, a. Therefore when the macroscopic body pass from an arbitrary
general state to a state of phase transition we get essential contraction of a set
of parameters necessary to describe this body. As a result of that an immense
set of macroscopic bodies being characterized by diﬀerent parameters in a general
state may be described by identical values of a small number of parameters in a
state of phase transition. Physicists designate this property of phase transitions as
universality.

Now we consider the universality of phase transition in details. Let X1, X2, . . . be
a sequence of independent random variables with a same distribution function F (x).
If there exist constants An, bn, of a such a type that distribution functions of the
n
normalized sums Sn = A−1
k=1 Xk −bn) converge to a distribution function G(x)
n (
when n → ∞ we say that the distribution function G(x) attracts the distribution
function F (x). Further we shall call a set of all distribution functions F (x) attracted
to the distribution function G(x) as a domain of attraction of the distribution
function G(x). According to a probability theory the stable distribution functions
and only they have domains of attractions. When we interpret a stable random
variable as a random variable of macroscopic body in a state of phase transition then
we should interpret an appropriate domain of attraction as a class of universality
of this phase transition.

P

According to a probability theory the normal distribution function attracts the
largest set of distribution functions while domains of attraction of other stable
distributions consist of those distribution functions which are in some sense similar
to these stable distributions e.g. they are expressed by the same formulae as these
stable distributions where however constants have to be changed by slowly changing
functions (in sense by Karamata, J. 1930)[12]. More precisely the distribution
function F (x) belongs to the attraction domain of a stable random variable with a
characteristic exponent α, 0 < α < 2 if and only if for any constant k > 0

diﬀerence between phase transitions of the 1-st and 2-nd order: a mean value of
the random variable is not changed under phase transition of the 1-st order and is
changed under phase transition of the 2-nd order.

P

For constructing of the phase diagrams it may appear useful a notion of a domain
of partial attraction. Let X1, X2, . . . be a sequence of independent random variables
with the same distribution function F (x).
If there exist such a subsequence of
natural numbers j and constants Aj, bj, that distribution functions of normalized
j
sums Sj = A−1
k=1 Xk − bj) converge to a distribution function G(x) provided
j (
that j → ∞ then we say that the distribution function F (x) belongs to a domain
of partial attraction of the distribution function G(x). Thus a diﬀerence between
domains of complete and partial attraction rests on a diﬀerence between a sequence
of all natural numbers and its proper subsequence. It appears that every inﬁnitely
divisible random variable (more precisely, the appropriate type) has a domain of
partial attraction (Khintchine, A.J. 1937)[13]. Moreover every random variable
belongs to a domain of partial attraction of only one type or a countable set of
types or does not belong to any domain of partial attraction (D¨oblin, W. 1940, [1];
Gnedenko, B.V.1940, [7]). If under changing of external parameters a macroscopic
body can undergo to diﬀerent phase transitions then the appropriate random variab-
le must move from a domain of attraction of one stable random variable to another
one. This movement may take place only through domains of partial attraction.

D. Density of a stable statistical distribution under phase transition. Rational

and irrational critical indexes.

According to probability theory the stable probability measure has density which
is analytical function with well known power series expansion. Further for simplicity
of exposition we shall discuss only strictly stable measure µ which canonical repre-
sentations is deﬁned by the L´evy spectral measure only. Since the L´evy measure
of stable probability measure is power function by the formula (2.21) then except
of the Fourier transformation of this measure it is reasonable to consider also the
Mellin transformation of it

M [g](s) = M (s) =

g(x)xs−1dx.

It is easy to show that the Mellin transformation of stable probability measure has
the following expression:

(2.23)

M (s|α, ρ) =

Γ(s − 1)Γ (1 + 1/α − s/α)
Γ(ρs − ρ)Γ(1 + ρ − ρs)

Here we characterize a stable random measure by parameters α, ρ instead of the
parameters α, β used earlier. A connection between the parameters β and ρ has

12

E.D. BELOKOLOS

such a form:

β = cot(πα/2) tan(πα(ρ − (1/2)))

Now let us carry out an inverse Mellin transformation

Using elementary properties of the Fox H-function we can show that the stable
densities for any values of parameters α and ρ are solutions of some integro-
diﬀerential equations with the integration and diﬀerentiation operators in general
of the fractional order.

If the Fox H-function (2.24) has rational parameters A1, . . . , Ap, B1, . . . , Bq then
it degenerates to the Meyer G-function that satisﬁes the ordinary diﬀerential equa-
tion with polynomial coeﬃcients of the order max(p, q). This diﬀerential equation
has 2 (if p 6= q) or 3 (if p = q) singular points. Thus if the parameters α, ρ are
rational numbers α = M/N, ρ = L/M,
(M, N ) = 1, then the stable densities are
solutions of the usual diﬀerential equations of the order max(M − 1, N − 1) and are
expressed in terms of the Meyer G-function (Zolotarev, V.M. 1994)[24]:

g(x, M/N, L/M ) = (2π)L−(1/2)(M+N )(M N )1/2x−1 ×

As we see the properties of stable probability measures depend essentially on
whether critical indexes are rational or irrational. In the modern theory of phase

minimal models in 2-dimensional conformal statistical mechanics etc.

E. Many-dimensional stable random variables and phase transitions.
The many-dimensional stable random variables are very important from point of
view of applications. The L´evy spectral measure for the many-dimensional random
variable has much more complicated form than that for the one-dimensional case
when as we know it is just a power function. And this is one of the main diﬃculties
in the many-dimensional case.

First of all let us give a short review of stable random variables in Rk [11] [9].
A random variable X is called stable if there exist a sequence of independent
and equally distributed random variables {Xn} which after normalization it by

FOUNDATIONS OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND THEORY OF PHASE TRANSITIONS13

the linear operators An ∈ GL(Rk) and centering by vectors bn ∈ Rk converge by
distribution to a random variable X,

A full probability measure µ corresponding to the random variable X is stable
if and only if there exist an operator B and a vector-valued function b(t) of such a
type that for all t > 0

or which is the same

(2.33)

(Sakovich, G.N. 1961,1965[20][21]; Sharpe, M. 1969[23])
In accordance with this result an inﬁnitely divisible measure µ = [a, R, M ] is

stable if and only if for all t > 0

where

a(t) = b(t) + tBa +

Z (cid:20)

The vector b(t) that appears in this formulae has the following form :

(2.30)

b(t) = t

v−Bdv d,

1/t

Z

where d is some constant vector in Rk. (It is possible that this formula is new, we
have not succeed to ﬁnd it in the available literature).

E(µ) = {B ∈ GL(Rk)| µt = tBµ ∗ δ(b(t))}

we shall call a set of exponents for the stable measure µ under consideration.

(2.32)

S(µ) = {A ∈ GL(Rk)| Aµ = µ ∗ δ(a) for some a ∈ Rk}

we shall call a symmetry group for the measure µ.

A full stable measure µ has one and only one exponent if its symmetry group is

Let Σ(B) be a spectrum of the operator B. We can show that

Σ(B) ⊂ {z ∈ Ck| ℜz ≥ 1/2}.

Let µ be a full stable measure with an exponent B. Let us present a minimal
polynom of the operator B in a form of product of polynomials g1, g2 of such a type
that a real part of zeros for the polynom g1 is equal to 1/2 and a real part of zeros
for the polynom g2 is strictly greater than 1/2. Then we can present the measure
µ in a form

(2.34)

µ = µ1 ∗ µ2,

14

E.D. BELOKOLOS

where µ1 is the measure of normal random variable and the measure µ2 has not
any normal component. Moreover

ker g1(B) = supp µ1, ker g2(B) = lin(supp µ2), and
Rk = supp µ1 ⊕ lin(supp µ2).

If a full stable measure µ is not normal then its moments

satisfy the following inequalities :

(2.35)

(2.36)
(2.37)

αp =

kxkpµ(dx)

Z

αp < ∞ for 0 < p < 1/Λ,
αp = ∞ for p > 1/Λ, where
Λ = max{ℜx| x ∈ Σ(B)}.

If 1 6∈ Σ(B) then there exist a vector a ∈ Rk which depends on B and is of such

a type that the measure ν = µ ∗ δ(a) is strictly stable i.e.

νt = tBν.
Each stable measure in Rk is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue

measure on Rk and its density has derivatives of all orders.

3. Example: 2–parametric scaling theory of phase transitions.

Now let us analyze a simple example of application for the theory put forward
above in assumption that the random variable characterizing macroscopic body
takes its values in R2.

Let the stable random variable describing macroscopic body under phase tran-

sition has an exponent of the following form

(3.38)

(3.39)

B =

(cid:18)

1/α1
0

0
1/α2 (cid:19)

, 0 < α1 ≤ 2, 0 < α2 ≤ 2.

We have to study cases 1 6∈ Σ(B) and 1 ∈ Σ(B) separately.
(1) At ﬁrst let be α1 6= 1, α2 6= 1.
Under this condition we have according to the formula (2.30)

b(t) =

t1/α1 − 1
1/α1 − 1

d1,

t1/α2 − 1
1/α2 − 1

d2

,

(cid:19)

(cid:18)
where d1, d2 are some constants.

Let us take a measure µ in the form

(3.40)

µ = ν ∗ δ

−

d1
1/α1 − 1

∗ δ

−

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

d2
1/α2 − 1

.

(cid:19)

(cid:18)

Then substituting this expression for the measure in (2.27) we can convince our-
selves that the appropriate random variable is strictly stable i.e. νt = tBν.
It
is worthwhile to point out here that a convolution of a probability measure with
a degenerate one (i.e.
the delta–function) is equivalent to changing a frame to
reference of the random variable. Thus in accordance with the formula (3.40)
when we change a frame of reference of the random variable then with assumption
1 6∈ Σ(B) we can always make the random variable strictly stable that we shall
suppose further.

FOUNDATIONS OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND THEORY OF PHASE TRANSITIONS15

According to (2.28) the logarithm of characteristic function ˜µ(y1, y2) of the

strictly stable random variable satisfy the equation

(3.41)

q ˜µ(y1, y2) = ˜µ(q1/α1 y1, q1/α2 y2), q > 0.

This functional equation has general solution (see for example [20])

2 ),

(3.42)

1 /yα2

2 ) ˜ν(yα1

˜µ(y1, y2) = (yα1

1 + yα2
where ˜ν(y) is arbitrary function which in the case under consideration is analytical
with respect to an appropriate local variable. Let us continue the analytical function
˜µ(y1, y2) in a complex plane and introduce generally accepted in physics notations:
y1 = t is a dimensionless temperature, y2 = h is a dimensionless ﬁeld, ˜µ(y1, y2) =
Φ(t, h) is a singular part of thermodynamic function under phase transition. In new
notations the equation (3.41) is nothing else than the equation of scale invariance
for singular part of thermodynamic function under phase transition which is well
known in physics. The thermodynamic function itself according to (3.42) takes
such a form:

(3.43)

Φ(t, h) = (tα1 + hα2 )Ψ(tα1 /hα2).

Now let us deﬁne the critical indexes of the heat capacity C, the order parameter
η and the susceptibility χ which we can express through the thermodynamic func-
tion in such a way:

(3.44)

C = −

η = −

, χ = −

∂2Φ
∂t2 ,

∂Φ

∂2Φ
∂h2 .

Let us consider separately the cases of weak and strong ﬁelds.
(*) The weak ﬁelds, tα1 > hα2 . In this case

(3.45)

Φ(t, h) = tα1 f (h/tα1/α2 , sign t),

where f (x, ±) are real-analytical functions with the following power expansions:

(3.46)

(3.47)

1 x2 + f +
1 x + f −
We deﬁne the critical indexes α, β, γ in the range of weak ﬁelds by such a way:

f (x, +) = 1 + f +
f (x, −) = 1 + f −

2 x4 + . . .
2 x2 + . . . .

(3.48)

C ∼ |t|−α,

η ∼ |t|β for t < 0, χ ∼ |h|−γ for t > 0.

(**) The strong ﬁelds, tα1 < hα2. In this case

Φ(t, h) = hα2g(t/hα2/α1 ),

where g(x) is real-analytical function with the following power expansion:

We deﬁne the critical indexes ǫ, δ in the range of strong ﬁelds by such a way:

g(x) = 1 + g1x + g2x2 + . . . .

C ∼ h−ǫ,

η ∼ h1/δ.

(3.49)

(3.50)

(3.51)

Now substituting (3.45) and (3.49) in (3.44) and comparing the results of sub-
stitution with (3.48) and (3.51) appropriately we get the following expression for
the critical indexes deﬁned above in terms of the characteristic exponents:

(3.52)

α = 2 − α1, β = (α2 − 1)α1/α2, γ = (2 − α2)α1/α2,
ǫ = (2 − α1)α2/α1, δ = 1/(α2 − 1).

Analyzing asymptotic expansions for the correlation function of order parameter

(3.53)

G(r) = hη(r)η(0)i ∼ r−σ exp(−r/rc(t, h)), r → ∞,

where rc(t, h) is the correlation radius, physicists introduce three more critical
indexes ν, µ, ζ :

(3.54)

rc(t, 0) ∼ |t|−ν, rc(0, h) ∼ h−µ, ζ = σ − d + 2.

We can easily get indexes ν, µ from the equation of scale invariance of the singular
part of thermodynamic function (3.41) in a form

(3.55)

udΦ(t, h) = Φ(tu1/ν, hu1/µ),

where u is a unit of measurement of a linear size of macroscopic body and d is a
dimensionality of a space containing the body. Substituting in this equation the
thermodynamic function in the form (3.43) we ﬁnd that

Under assumption rc = ∞ in the asymptotic expression (3.53) for the correlation

function of order parameter we can show easily that

(3.56)

(3.57)

ν = α1/d, µ = α2/d.

ζ = d(α2 − 2)/α2 + d.

The formulae (3.52), (3.56), (3.57), express the critical indexes of phase transi-
tions in terms of characteristic exponents and reproduce completely results of so
called the 2-parametric scaling theory of phase transitions.

We want to draw attention of the reader to some preferred values of the charac-

teristic exponents.

For the characteristic exponent α1 ∈ (0, 2] the value α1 = 2 is singled out.
Under this value of the characteristic exponent the domain of attraction or, which
is the same, the universality class of phase transition is the largest possible one and
therefore we should wait for the value α1 = 2 in majority of phase transitions.

According to deﬁnition α2 ∈ (0, 2]. However if we make in addition a very natural
assumption that the quantity σ = d − 2 + ζ = 2d(α2 − 1)/α2 which appears in the
expression for the correlation function (3.53) is non-negative then we should accept
that α2 ∈ (1, 2]. If α2 → 1 + 0 then σ → +0 and therefore in a critical range where
rc = ∞ and G(r) ∼ r−σ the correlations of the order parameter will decrease very
slowly. This circumstance singles out the value α2 = 1. (We shall not discuss here
an interesting case when α2 ∈ [0, 1]. In this case the correlations of order parameter
in critical range should increase with distance.)

Let us apply these considerations to analysis of the critical indexes of phase

transitions which we have in fact in diﬀerent cases.

Let us suppose that d → ∞ as it is indeed in the mean ﬁeld theory. In this case
limit values of the critical indexes characterizing the correlation function do not
depend on the characteristic exponents:

(3.58)

(3.59)

(3.60)

If in addition we assume that

ν = 0, µ = 0, ζ = −∞.

α1 = 2, α2 = 4/3,

then other critical indexes take the so called “classical” values

α = 0, β = 1/2, γ = 1, ǫ = 0, δ = 3.

FOUNDATIONS OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND THEORY OF PHASE TRANSITIONS17

Let us consider d = 3. If in addition we assume that

(3.61)

α1 = 2, α2 = 6/5,

then the critical indexes take rational values

(3.62)

α = 0, β = 1/3, γ = 4/3, ǫ = 0, δ = 5, ν = 2/3, µ = 2/5, ζ = 0,

which describe well enough numerous experimental data. However the following
values of the characteristic exponents lead to better agreement with an experiment
:

(3.63)

α1 = 1, 89 ± 0, 05, α2 = 1, 210 ± 0, 005,

(2) Now let be α1 = 1, α2 6= 1.
Under this assumption we have according to the formula (2.30),

(3.64)

b(t) =

t ln t d1,

(cid:18)

t1/α2 − t
(1/α2) − 1

d2

,

(cid:19)

where d1, d2 are some constants. We may put d2 = 0 if we change in appropriate
way a point of reference. Assuming that we can present the probability measure µ
in the following form

(3.65)

µ = ν ∗ λ,

where ν is a strictly stable measure and

(3.66)

ˆλ(y1, y2) = −id1y1 ln |y1|.
Now similarly to the previous case we get for the logarithm of characteristic

function the following expression:

(3.67)

ˆµ(y1, y2) = −id1y1 ln |y1| + (y1 + yα2

2 )ρ(y1/yα2

2 ),

where ρ(z) is an analytic function with respect to some local variable. Continu-
ing analytically the function ˆµ(y1, y2) in a complex plane and ascribing a special
physical meaning to its independent variables we obtain from ˆµ(y1, y2) a singular
part of the thermodynamic function in a vicinity of phase transition.

If e.g. we assume that α2 = 16/15, y1 = t2, where t is the dimensionless
temperature and y2 = h is dimensionless ﬁeld then the function ˆµ(y1, y2) is trans-
formed to a singular part of the thermodynamic function of the exactly solvable
Ising model

Φ(t, h) = ct2 ln |t| + (t2 + h16/15)Ψ(t2/h16/15),

c is some constant. In order to see that it is enough to consider limit cases

Φ(t, h) ≃ t2(c1 ln |t| + c2) + c3ht1/8, t > h8/15
Φ(t, h) ≃ c4h16/15 + t2(c5 ln |t| + c6), t < h8/15,

(3.68)

(3.69)

(3.70)

where ci, i = 1, . . . , 6 are some constants. It is well known classical result (Onsager,
L. 1944, 1947 [17], [18]).

In other exactly solvable models of statistical mechanics the characteristic expo-

nent α2 is a constant or a rational function of the characteristic exponent α1.

We obtain similar results for the macroscopic bodies in state of phase transition

described by random variables with the following exponents

4. Conclusion.

In the paper we have given a new formulation of statistical mechanics and built
on this basis a theory of phase transition. According to this approach the random
variables describing macroscopic bodies in statistical mechanics are inﬁnitely divi-
sible that is just mathematical expression of an atomic-molecular structure of the
matter. In a state of phase transition these random variables are stable that reﬂects
an invariance of the thermodynamic functions of macroscopic bodies with respect
to transformations of the renormalization semigroup.

We should point out some questions which have been studied but have not
presented here: diﬀerent examples of computation of critical indexes, discussion of
limit cases (the mean ﬁeld theory, the Landau theory, the Lee and Yang theory
etc.), the non-ergodic systems and spin glasses, the non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics, an interconnections with microscopic theories. We are going to publish
them elsewhere.

The author express his gratitude to Kochubei A.N. for his intertest to this work

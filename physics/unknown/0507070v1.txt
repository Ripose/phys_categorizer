Abstract  Multiplicative  noise  is  found  to  divide  the  growth  law  of  tumors  into  two 

parts  in  a  logistic  model,  which  is  driven  by  additive  and  multiplicative  noises 

simultaneously. The Fokker-Planck equation was also derived to explain the fact that 

the influence of the intensity of multiplicative noise on the growth of tumor cells has a 

stochastic  resonance-like  characteristic.  An  appropriate  intensity  of  multiplicative 

noise is benefit to the growth of the tumor cells. The correlation between two sorts of 

noises  weakens  the  stochastic  resonance-like  characteristic.  Homologous  noises 

promote the growth of the tumor cells. 

Keywords:  stochastic  resonance,  multiplicative  noise,  tumor,  logistic  model, 

correlation. 

Since  half  a  century  ago,  nonlinear  physics  has  changed  our  views  of  world 

drastically [1]. People expected to use it to solve the complexity of biology [2, 3]. In 

the past decade, more and more evidence shows that noise plays an important role in 

nonlinear  systems  [4-10],  such  as  noise-induced  phase  transitions,  stochastic 

resonance  (SR)  and  so  on.  Especially,  SR  uncovered  a  heap  of  complexities  of 

biology  [11,  12].  For  many  years,  the  law  of  tumors  growth  has  been  a  challenging 

subject. Scientists try hard to find exact measures to control tumors and cure cancers 

with  physical,  mathematical,  biological  and  chemical  methods.  And  many  models 

have  been  established,  such  as  Eden  model  [13],  Gompertzian  growth  model  [14], 

self-limiting growth model [15], and feedback model [16]. Bru et al. [17] discovered 

that  tumor  growth  is  mainly  governed  by  environmental  pressures  (host  tissue

pressure,  immune  response,  etc.)  through  both  simulations  and  experiments  of  the 

immune  responses  of  mice.  Logistic  growth  equation,  a  nonlinear  equation  with 

profound  physical  meaning,  affords  a  good  annotation  about  the  origins  and 

evolutions of biology [18]. Ai et al. [19] first applied logistic growth model induced 

by  correlated  noises  to  analyze  the  growth  of  the  tumor  cells  and  found  that  strong 

fluctuation  in  the  growth  rate  would  exterminate  tumor  cells.  For  the  sake  of 

simplicity, Ai et al. only dealt with some factors, including fluctuations of temperature, 

drugs, radiotherapy, etc., that have influence on the growth rate of the tumors. In fact, 

the environments affect the decay rate as well as the growth rate.   

In  this  paper,  considering  the  fluctuation  of  the  linear  growth  rate  under  a  stable 

carrying  capacity  of  environment,  we  study  the  influences  of  the  intensities  of 

correlated  noises  on  the  growth  of  the  tumor  cells,  and  indicate  that  multiplicative 

noise (MN) can divide the growth law of tumors into two parts. We will show that the 

intensity of multiplicative noise affects the growth of the tumor cells with an SR-like 

trend.  The  peak  of  SR  depends  upon  the  change  of  correlation  between  noises.  We 

attempt to give an insight into the intrinsic growth principle of tumors and present a 

new concept for tumor treatments.

    Logistic model proposed by Verhulst [18] is written as

where  r  is  the  linear  per  capita  birth  rate,  K  is  the  carrying  capacity  of  the 

environment  and  x  is  the  population.  This  is  an  ideal  equation  without  fluctuation. 

Factually, tumor cells are always influenced by the environment, and their linear per 

capita  birth  rate  changes  and  fluctuates  consequentially.  So  it  is  reasonable  to 

introduce  noise  x(t)  into  the  above  model  and  rewrite  r  as  r+x(t).  Likewise, 

emigration and immigration of tumors, set at h(t), also affect the change in the number 

of  the  tumor  cells  in  a  local  area.  The  Langevin  differential  equation  induced  by 

noises is

Here  <x>  and  <dx2>  are  the  mean  number  of  tumor  cells  and  its  variance,

2 Results and discussions 

    The growth and extension of a tumor are affected by the environment [17, 21]. The 

treatments  have  positive  or  negative  effects  on  the  environment  of  a  tumor  [22]. 

Therapies,  such  as  chemotherapy  and  radiotherapy,  are  two-edged  swords.  They  not 

only kill the tumors, but also activate them. Moreover, they can cause the canceration 

of the normal cells. All of these changes are undeterminate; therefore investigating the 

correlation  of  two  sorts  of  noises,  multiplicative  and  additive  noises,  is  vital  to  the 

clarification  of 

the  underlying  mechanism.  In 

the  model, 

the 

intensity  of 

multiplicative  noise  refers  to  the  strength  of  the  treatment,  i.e.  the  dosage  of  the 

medicine in chemotherapy or the intensity of the ray in radiotherapy. The intensity of 

additive  noise  serves  as  the  capability  of  expansionary  transfer  of  the  tumors.  The 

correlation between additive and multiplicative noises denotes the adaptability of the 

tumors  to  the  treatments.  If  λ=0,  the  tumor  is  completely  unconformable,  or  else  if 

λ=1, the tumor develops a perfect adjus

tability.

D. The parameters are λ=0.0, Q=2.0. 

The  above  change  in  curve  trend  suggests  that  there  exists  a  phase  transition  in  the 

growth law of the tumors driven by noises. The position of the peaks (PPs) near x=0 

denotes  the  tumor’s  deterioration,  and  PPs  near  x=K  means  the  adaption  of  some 

tumor cells to the treatments. The influence of noises on the growth law of the tumors 

extends first and then shrinks with the increase of the intensity of MN , as shown in 

the  inset  of  Fig.1.  As  a  whole,  an  appropriate  intensity  of  multiplicative  noise  can 

break  down  the  growth  law  of  the  tumors,  while  superfluous  noises  improve  their 

growth contrarily. 

    Fig.2 shows the change of NTC with the intensity of MN under different intensities 

of  additive  noises.  As  the  intensity  of  MN  increases,  NTC  increases  first  and  then 

decreases, showing a typical SR-like characteristic. Obviously, an unsuitable intensity 

of  the  treatment  can  not  kill  tumors,  but  activate  them.  Consequently,  in  order  to 

acquire a good cure of tumors, an adequately strong intensity of treatment is required. 

Unfortunately,  the  normal  cells  take  a  risk  of  canceration  under  excess  intensity  of 

treatment  at  the  same  time.  This  is  also  a  dilemma  for  current  chemotherapy  and 

radiotherapy.   

    As  the  intensity  of  additive  noise 

increases,  the  value  of  peak  in  Fig.2 

rises but the position of peak remains 

intact.  Fig.3  shows  another  SR-like

the 

intensity  of  correlation  at  various 

cells  with  the  intensity  of  multiplicative  noise  at 

λ=0.0,  from  bottom  to  top,  Q=0.5,  1.0,  2.0, 

intensities of noises. In the case of weak noises,  NTC  drops  with  an  increase  in  the 

correlation.  If  the  noises  are  strong,  NTC  rises  with  an  increase  in  the  correlation. 

NTC does not change with the correlation at intermediate noise intensities. 

    These  results  suggest  that  a  tumor  grows  and  extends  more  steadily  as  the 

correlation becomes closer. This means that the tumor has a better adjustability to the 

treatment.  When  adjustability  reaches 

a  definite  degree,  i.e.  λ>0.8,  the  peak 

 

of  SR  degenerates  and  disappears. 

Then  the  noise,  however  strong  their 

intensities  are,  can  not  affect  tumors,

3 Conclusions 

There are two sorts of noises: one originates from environment like chemotherapy 

and  radiotherapy,  and  the  other  roots  in  the  tumors  themselves.  The  former  is 

multiplicative, and the latter is additive. The growth law of the tumors is divided into 

two  parts  under  the  effect  of  multiplicative  noise.  The  influence  of  multiplicative 

noise  on  the  tumors  has  a  stochastic  resonance-like  characteristic.  An  appropriate 

intensity  of  multiplicative  noise  leads  the  tumor  cells  to  develop  steadily.  The 

correlation  between  noises  weakens  the  stochastic  resonance-like  characteristic. 

Homologous noises promote the growth law of the tumor cells.

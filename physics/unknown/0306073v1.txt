Abstract.  The  field  of  scalar  and  vector  potentials  in  electrodynamics  is  shown  to  represent  an 
informational field  capable of  superluminally  transmitting  a  signal  (information) with no energy 
and  momentum  transfer.  This  conclusion  strictly  follows  from  Maxwell's  equations  for 
electromagnetic  field  interacting  with  electric  charges  and  currents  in  vacuum, without resort to 
any additional hypotheses. That superluminal communication is possible is seen from the fact that 
the own field, generated by particles and inseparable from them, transforms the environment into 
a  special  physical  medium  which  is  capable  to  instantaneously  transfer  a  signal  (information) 
about  any  changes,  happening  to  a  particle  in  the  region  of  its  basic  localization,  to  arbitrarily 
large  distances.  The  phenomenon  of  superluminal  communication  is  caused  by  the  non-local 
connection of scalar and vector potentials with the electric and magnetic field strengths. The basis 
for  the  mechanism  of  superluminal  communication  considered  in  this  work  is  the  Aharonov-
Bohm  effect  indicative  of  the  field  of  electromagnetic  potentials  as  a  real  physical  field,  which 
directly  influences  the  behaviour  of  electron  waves.  The  conclusion  is  made  that  in  quantum 
systems  superluminal  signals  occur  constantly,  in  any  quantum  processes.  The  occurrence  of 
superluminal signals is due to the space-time symmetry breaking of a special kind, consisting in 
that the equations for potentials do not possess relativistic invariance though Maxwell’s equations 
for the field strengths are Lorentz-invariant. The results presented do not contradict the physical 
principles underlying special relativity and confirm the fundamental conclusion, made for the first 
time by de Broglie, that gauge invariance is not an absolute law in physics.  
 
Key  words:  superluminal  communication,  own  field,  informational  field,  vortex  field,  non-
locality, self-organizing system, open system, self-action, interference, symmetry breaking. 
 

1. Introduction 

 
According to the generally accepted point of view, the velocity of light in vacuum is the greatest 
possible  velocity  of  transfer  of  a  signal  existing  in  nature.  This  conclusion  was  formulated  by 
A.Einstein as a consequence of the special theory of relativity (STR) and of the causality principle as 
follows: “... There is no way of sending the signals which would propagate faster than light in vacuum” 
(see [1], p. 157). 

Meanwhile,  research  of  relativistic  wave  equations  shows  that  those  admit  solutions  which 
describe the waves propagating with the group velocity exceeding the velocity of light in vacuum [2-
10]. It should be emphasized that the occurrence of superluminal signals does not result in violation of 
causality  principle.  As  appears  from  the  detailed  analysis  [2,11,12],  the  standard  arguments  that  the 
existence  of  superluminal  signals  is  forbidden  by  the  causality  principle  are  erroneous  because  those 
are  based  exclusively  on  the  use  of  Lorentz  transformations,  i.e.  of  kinematics.  The  cause  and  effect 
relationship between events is caused, however, by the process of interaction transfer from one event to 
another and, hence, is a problem of dynamics. This process can be described merely with the help of 

 

2 

solutions  of  dynamical  equations  obeying  certain  initial  conditions.  It  is  essential  that  because  of  the 
difference in the initial conditions corresponding to the process of propagating superluminal signal in 
various inertial frames of reference there is no way to transfer information to the past [2]. As shown in 
[12],  the  conclusion  that  superluminal  signals  cannot  exist  does  not  follow  from  STR  and  is  an 
additional hypothesis inconsistent with Maxwell’s equations.  

The  prediction  that  electromagnetic  waves  exist  whose  group  velocity  exceeds the velocity of 
light  in  vacuum  is  supported  by  numerous  experimental  results  [13-19].  Besides,  mention  should  be 
made of the paper [20] in which experimental data are given on the superluminal information transfer 
in artificially created media (metamaterials) with negative dielectric and magnetic susceptibilities, and 
also the review papers [21-23] in which various aspects of the problem of superluminal movements are 
considered.  

On  the  basis  of  theoretical  research  on  the  superluminal  communication  problem,  one  can 
conclude  that  there  are  no  basic  restrictions  that  would  prohibit  him  from  producing  the  pulses  of 
electromagnetic  field  with  group  velocity  exceeding  that  of  light  in  vacuum.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is 
evident from experimental research that by now the light barrier has been surmounted and the signal 
velocity achievable is limited only by the potentialities of experimental equipment.  

The  experimental  works  mentioned  above  are  dealt  with  superluminal  propagation  of  optical 
pulses, i.e. the packets of transverse electromagnetic waves. Mathematically, such packets correspond 
to  solutions  of  homogeneous  wave  equations.  Study  of  the  non-homogeneous  wave  equations 
describing  electromagnetic  field  shows  that  the  field  consists  of  two  components  –  the  photon 
component and the own field of electrically charged particles, which essentially differ from each other 
by  their  physical  characteristics  [12,24-26].  The  own  field  is  inseparable  from  the  charged  particles 
generating  it;  it  is  a  field  of  standing  waves  of  matter,  which  is  not  subject  to  the  wave-corpuscular 
duality  and  cannot  be  reduced  to  a  stream  of  photons.  This  field  transforms  the  environment  into  a 
physical  medium,  which  is  capable  to  instantaneously  transfer  a  signal  (information)  about  a 
perturbation  occurring  at  some  point  of  space  to  arbitrarily  large  distance.  The  conclusion  that 
superluminal  communication  with  the  help  of  own  field  is  possible  follows  from  the  formulation  of 
quantum  electrodynamics  [12,27,28]  in  which  the  self-action  of  electron  is  taken  into  account  –  the 
back influence on electron of the own field generated by it. Owing to the self-action, electron turns into 
an open self-organizing system, which, in view of the long-range character of the own field, occupies 
the whole space. For such a  system to  be  stable,  there should exist a physical mechanism binding its 
parts  into  a  single  whole.  It  is  the  instantaneous  transfer  of  information  via  the  own  field  that  is, 
apparently, such a mechanism. 

The  conclusion  that  the  instantaneous  long-range  interaction  and  the  short-range  interaction 
occurring with the velocity of light can co-exist simultaneously is made also in papers [29-31], starting 
from  the  completely  different  line  of  reasoning  -  on  the  basis  of  the  separated-potential  method  in 
classical  electrodynamics  (the  electrodynamics  dualism  concept)  [29,30]  and  on  the  basis  of  the 
relativistic quantum field theory [31]. 

The  existence  of  superluminal  signals  is  supported  by  the  astronomical  observations,  which 
have been conducted for the first time by N.A. Kozyrev [32,33]. According to Kozyrev’s investigation, 
there  exists  in  nature  an  action-at-a-distance  of  one  body  on  another  resulting  in  the  superluminal 
transfer  of  signal.  These  results  have  been  confirmed  by  M.M.  Lavrentjev,  I.A.  Eganova  and  others 
[34,35] and also repeated in part in [36]. In the papers mentioned above the Kozyrev conclusions have 
been specified and have received further generalization and development.  

The field of scalar and vector potentials is shown in the present paper to be an informational 
field which is capable to transfer information about physical process with the speed lying in the range 
from  zero  to  infinity,  the  information  transfer  being  not  accompanied,  generally  speaking,  by  the 
energy and momentum transfer from the generator of signal to the receiver [37].

The physical mechanism of superluminal communication is due to the non-local connection of 
scalar  and  vector  potentials  with  the  electric  field  strength  E   and  magnetic  induction  B .  As  in 
quantum mechanics the interaction of electromagnetic field with charged particles is described in terms 
of potentials rather than  of electric  E  and magnetic  B  fields, in view of the non-locality mentioned 
above, the change of fields  E  and  B  at the moment of time  t  in some bounded region of space  Γ  can 
lead  to  the  change  of  potentials  at the later moment 
 at an observation  point separated from the 
region  Γ  by any distance. Owing to the change of potentials, there occurs a shift of the wave function 
phases  of  charged  particles  at  the  observation  point,  which  can  be  detected  by  the  shift  of  the 
interference fringes.  

0+t

The basis for the mechanism of superluminal communication being considered is the Aharonov-
Bohm effect [38] indicative of the field of magnetic potential is a real physical field, which manifests 
itself in the experiments on electron diffraction in the presence of magnetic field. As is emphasized by 
G. Lochak in [39], “this remarkable effect, which proves the influence of a fieldless magnetic potential 
on electron waves, is shocking for those who have been convinced for a century that electromagnetic 
potentials  are  only  mathematical  intermediate  entities”.  The  shift  of  the  interference  fringes  in  the 
Aharonov-Bohm  effect  is  caused  by  the  change  in  the  wave  function  phase  of  electron  in  magnetic 
field,  which  follows  directly  from  the  de  Broglie  formula  linking  the  wavelength  of electron with its 
velocity and vector potential. It is essential that the electron interference depends on the choice of the 
vector  potential  gauge,  the  dependence  of  interference  fringes  on  potential  manifesting  itself  even  in 
the case that the source of potential is outside the region sandwiched between the electronic trajectories 
resulting in interference [39].  

The  main  result  of  the  present  paper  is  the  proof  that  the  existence  of  superluminal  signals, 
whose  carrier  is  the  own  field  of  electrically  charged  particles,  strictly  follows  from  Maxwell’s 
equations  for  the  electromagnetic  field  interacting  with  electric  charges  and  currents  in  vacuum.  In  a 
sense, superluminal signals and their physical  carrier  as  a  special physical medium are derived 
from the equations of electromagnetic field.  

 Superluminal  signaling  with  the  help  of  the  own  field  of  charged  particles  represents  a 
qualitatively  new  means  of  communication  possessing  a  lot  of  essential  advantages  over  the  optical 
one. It should be emphasized that at present all the necessary prerequisites are available for the creation 
of the means of superluminal communication based on the use of own fields [40].  

The results obtained in the paper are the following. 
In  section  2  a  family  of  potentials  of  electromagnetic  field  is  received  which  describes  the 
transfer of information in space at any speed. The characteristic is given of the basic physical properties 
of the own field of potentials as a carrier of superluminal signals. The own field of electrically charged 
particles is shown to turn the surrounding space into a special physical medium which “is so arranged” 
that  it  is  capable  to  instantaneously  transfer  a  signal  (information)  about  any  changes  occurring  to  a 
particle in the region of its basic localization to arbitrarily large distance. 

In section  3 an  insight is  given into why it follows necessarily from Maxwell’s equations that 
superluminal  signals  exist  and  also  the  physical  mechanism  of  occurrence  of  these  signals  is 
considered.  The  prospects  for  the  further  research  are  pointed  out  in  the  field  of  quantum 
electrodynamics  taking  properly  into  account  the  own  fields  and  the  superluminal  signals  associated 
with them. 

The paper represents a development of physical ideas and generalization of the results set forth 

in the monograph [12].

As is obvious from (15) and (21), in the case of point-like particle the field of potentials in Lorentz's 
gauge and the field strengths  E  and  B  are propagated in space with the same velocity – the velocity 
of light. Further, relying on the equivalence (in the mentioned above sense) of potentials 
 and 
A ε′
,  one  can  conclude  that  for  point-like  particle  the  field  strengths  are  always 
propagated  with  the  velocity  of  light  irrespective  of  the  choice  of  gauge.  However,  the  velocity  of 
propagation  of  the  field  of  potentials,  i.e.  the  velocity  of  transfer  of  physical  information  not 
accompanied by energy and momentum transport in space, essentially depends on gauge and can vary

Thus,  in  the  electromagnetic  field  generated  by  classical  point-like  particles,  information  is 
transferred  with  the  velocity  of  light  only  in  the  event  that  potentials  obey  the  Lorentz  gauge.  If 
parameter  ε is plotted on a coordinate axis, the solutions of Maxwell’s equations subject to the Lorentz 
gauge correspond merely to one point. Obviously, such solutions make up only a very narrow class of

solutions of Maxwell’s equations. The solutions corresponding to generalized gauge at

1<ε

The statement made above that solutions of Maxwell’s equations, corresponding to the Lorentz 
gauge,  describe  the  electromagnetic  field  propagating  with  the  velocity  of  light  is  obviously  of  an 
approximate character: it is true only in the view of standard formulation of quantum electrodynamics 
[41] based on the concept of point-like particles. The formulation, as is evident from an analysis of the 
problem [12,27], is a rather rough approximation to the reality because it takes no account of the self-
action of particles – the back action of the own field generated by a particle on the same particle. The 
self-action of particles is not small in comparison with interaction between particles and, consequently, 
it  cannot be taken into account by perturbation theory.  Owing to  the incorporation of self-action into 
theoretical  scheme  the  particles  cease  to  be  point-like  and  become  spatially  extended  objects.  As  a 
result the potentials in the Lorentz gauge, too, describe superluminal transfer of information. In other 
words,  in  describing  real  electromagnetic  interaction  there  is  no  gauge  of  potentials  which  would 
allow one “to get rid” of superluminal signals. 
 To elucidate the physical nature of the occurrence of superluminal signals, we address again to 
 
Maxwell’s  equations  (1).  Splitting  each  of  the  vectors  involved  in  equations  (1)  into  potential  and 
vortex components according to formulas (10), we present these equations as two independent subsets:

degree of freedom of electromagnetic field. 

From  the  above  analysis  of  Maxwell’s  equations  for  the  potential  and  vortex  components  of 
electromagnetic  field,  it  can  be  inferred  that  the  electromagnetic  field  generated  by  electric  charges 
and currents in vacuum consists of two components: 1) the own field of electrically charged particles 
which is not an independent degree of freedom of electromagnetic field, and 2) the field of transverse 
electromagnetic  waves.  The  potential  component  of  the  own  field  is  described  by  potential 
A ε
)()(
  (12).  In  addition,  the  field 
x
||
  contains  the  transverse  electromagnetic  waves,  which  are  emitted  by  and  separated  from 
)(x⊥A
particles  when  they  move  with  acceleration  (the  radiation  field  [42]).  These  components  essentially 
differ from each other by their physical characteristics. 

(14),  and  the  vortex  one  is  described,  in  part,  by  potential 

)(x⊥A

The own field is, in a sense, a constituent of charged particles and does not submit to the wave-
corpuscular duality. It represents a field of standing waves of matter rigidly connected to particles and 
going from one particle to another or to infinity. This field is purely of a classical character and does 
not reduce to the set of photons. The own field of a particle seems to be responsible for the occurrence 
of  its  wave  properties,  which  manifest  themselves,  for  example,  in  the  experiments  on  electron 
diffraction.  

In distinction to the own field, the field of transverse electromagnetic waves represents a stream 
of  photons  moving  in  vacuum  with  the  velocity  of  light.  It  is  that  part  of  the  electromagnetic  field 
generated by charged particles, which is split out of the own field and then separated from particles.  

To gain a better insight into the relationship between the photon component of electromagnetic 
field and the own field, imagine a point-like particle at rest in an inertial frame of reference. The own 
field  of  such  a  particle  reduces  to  static  Coulomb  field  that  is  potential.  When  the  particle  moves 
uniformly and rectilinearly, a vortex component is split out of the own field in the whole space [12]. 
This component represents, obviously, such a vortex electromagnetic field, which cannot be a stream of 
photons. At last, when the particle moves with acceleration, its vortex own field is distorted, with the 
result  that  a  stream  of  elementary  excitations  of  the  field  is  generated  which  turn  to  quanta  of 
electromagnetic field at large distances from the particle. 

The existence of the own field seems to be a necessary condition for the field of radiation as a 
stream  of  photons  to  occur.  In  fact,  the  own  field,  which  is  indissolubly  related  to  particles  and 
inseparable  from  them,  serves  as  a  physical  medium  in  which  photons  are  formed  and  travel  and 
without which they cannot exist.  
 

3. The Physical Mechanism of Superluminal Communication 

In the previous section, based on the analysis of Maxwell’s equations, the family of potentials 
of  the  electromagnetic  field  generated  in  vacuum  by  electric  charges  and  currents  is  derived.  The 
potentials  depend  on  a  real  parameter  ε,  which  is  involved  both  in  the  D’Alembert  operator

, describing wave properties of the field, and in the constraint imposed on the potentials. 
The  distinguishing  feature  of  potentials  is  that  in  all  the  gauges  being  considered,  except  for  the 
Lorentz gauge, both the components of vector-potential, potential and vortex, taken separately, and the 
total vector-potential depend on superluminal signals.

consequence  the  relativistic  invariance  of  Maxwell’s  equations  (1)  is  retained.  The  occurrence  of 
superluminal signals can be seen from the above to be associated with the space-time symmetry 
breaking  of  a  special  sort,  consisting  in  that  the  equations  for  potentials  do  not  possess  relativistic 
invariance  though  Maxwell’s  equations  for  the  field  strengths  (1)  are  Lorentz-invariant.  The  above 
solutions  of  Maxwell’s  equations  describing  superluminal  transfer  of  information  are  characterized, 
thus, by the breaking of space-time symmetry of the field of potentials.  

With the help of gauge transformation (19) it is not difficult to separate out that part of potential 

that is responsible for the symmetry breaking:

Here 
is the potential in the Lorentz gauge that represents a 4-vector, and the second addend in 
the right-hand side of (24) is not a 4-vector and takes into account the symmetry breaking of the field 
of  potentials.  Obviously,  the  potential  (24)  would  be  a  4-vector  if  the  quantity 
  were  a  scalar, 
however this quantity, as is seen from an analysis [37], is not a scalar.  
By  virtue  of  the  fact  that  the  constraint  (3)  at 

  is  not  invariant  under  Lorentz 
transformations, the question arises of whether the solutions of the equations of electromagnetic field 
with broken symmetry have physical sense. Perhaps, such solutions should be discarded as they break 
the  ban  imposed  by  special  relativity  on  superluminal  signals?  Notice,  first  of  all,  that  the  Coulomb 
) represents a special case of symmetry breaking of the equations for potentials. However, 
gauge (
it  is  generally  believed  that  the  use  of  the  Coulomb  gauge  is  quite  possible  [43].  As  Maxwell’s 
equations completely govern the behaviour of electromagnetic field interacting with charged particles, 
it  is  natural  to  believe  that  all  their  solutions  subject  to  required  conditions  (solutions  should  be 
continuous  together  with  a  certain  number  of  their  partial  derivatives,  bounded  and  uniquely 
determined - these conditions are called standard) have physical sense. It is not difficult to check that 
the solutions to the equations for potentials in the generalized gauge satisfy the standard conditions at 
any real magnitudes of  ε. From here it follows that there are no grounds to discard them and, hence, 
one can hope that all these solutions are realized in nature.

At the first sight, from the expressions (25) and (26), whose advantages are simplicity, symmetry with 
respect  to  the  components  of  potential,  and  explicit  relativistic  invariance,  follows  of  necessity  the 

 

10 

conclusion  that  electromagnetic  field  propagates  in  vacuum  with  the  velocity  of  light  c .  Really, 
equalities (25) are the wave equations in which the D’Alembert operator points to the velocity of light 
as  the  velocity  of  propagation  of  electromagnetic  waves  and  the  right  part,  in  the  case  of  point-like 
charged  particles,  is  described  by  the  functions  concentrated  at  separate  geometrical  points.  Under 
these conditions, apparently, the velocity of electromagnetic signals can be equal solely to that of light. 
However this conclusion is erroneous. To explain why the occurrence of superluminal signals in 
electromagnetic field is inevitable, we shall decompose electromagnetic field into potential and vortex 
components and write the equations (25) in the form corresponding to such a decomposition:

degree  of  freedom  of  electromagnetic  field:  the  field 

As is emphasized in the previous section, the potential electric field 

||E  is not an independent 
||E ,  described  in  the  Lorentz  gauge  by  the 
||A ,  is  generated  by electrically charged particles and  is inseparable from them. 
For  this  reason  in  the  consistent  quantum  theory  this  field  should  be  included  in  the  definition  of 
particle  at  the  very  initial  stage  of  constructing  the  theory  as  it  is  done  in  [12,27,28].  In  such  a 
formulation  of  the  quantum  theory,  with  due  allowance  for  the  self-action  of  particles,  the  electric 
charge of particle (for example, of electron) proves to be distributed over all space: the distribution of 
electron charge consists of the region of the basic localization and of a tail extending from this region 
to infinity. As is seen from the results of this paper and of the papers [12,25,26], the “smearing” of the 
particle’s charge in space automatically gives rise to the occurrence of superluminal signals.  

Thus, the inaccuracy of the conclusions, which are usually drawn on the basis of equations (25) 
and  (26),  is  connected  with  the  fact  that  these  conclusions  prove  to  be  purely  formal,  divorced  from 
physical  reality.  They  do  not  take  into  account  the  fact  that  potential  component  of  electromagnetic 
field,  inextricably  related  to  electric  charge  of  particles,  represents,  in  essence,  an  integral  part  of 
electrically charged particles and, therefore, it is intolerable to consider it as an independent degree of 
freedom of electromagnetic field. 

The  Lorentz  gauge  is  the  only  gauge,  which  does  not  give  rise  to  symmetry  breaking  of  the 
equations for potentials and thereby masks the existence of superluminal signals. Simplicity, symmetry, 
and explicit relativistic invariance of the equations for potentials in this gauge seem to have merely a 
formal character, not reflecting the true physical nature of electromagnetic field. 

One can readily see that in any gauge the quantity  (

))(
||A

ε

εA
)(
0

,

 describing potential component 

of the own field depends on superluminal signals. If the self-action of particle is properly allowed for, 
the  potential  component  of  the  own  field  is  expressed  in  terms  of  the  particle’s  wave  function  [12]. 
From this it follows immediately that the dynamic equation describing self-action of particle takes of 
necessity  into  account  the  occurrence  of  superluminal  signals  in  the  particle’s  field.  Obviously,  the 
mechanism  of  the  superluminal  signal  transfer  consists  in  the  non-local  dependence  of  the  dynamic 
equation on time and spatial coordinates.  
Note  that  the  potentials 

)(εA   at  different  values  of  ε,  connected  with  each  other  by  gauge 
transformations, are physically equivalent only in the sense that they correspond to the same strengths 
of  electromagnetic  field.  As  in  classical  mechanics  the  interaction  between  the  field  and  particles  is 
described in terms of the field strengths, it is natural to tell about equivalence from the point of view of 

 

11 

classical dynamics. In quantum mechanics, however, the interaction is described in terms of potentials 
and  not  in  terms  of  strengths.  For  this  reason,  from  the  point  of  view  of  quantum  dynamics,  the 
)(εA ,  corresponding  to  different  values  of  ε,  are  not  equivalent  to  each  other.  They 
potentials 
differently  describe  the  interaction  of  microparticles  with  electromagnetic  field,  as  it  is  seen  from 
electron  interference  in  magnetic  field,  and  result  in  various  velocities  of  information  transfer.  The 
conclusion made for the first time by de Broglie that gauge invariance is not an absolute law in physics 
(see [39]) is, thus, supported not only by the Aharonov-Bohm effect, but also by the dependence of the 
velocity of information transfer on the choice of gauge of potentials. 

It  should  be  emphasized  that  superluminal  signals  must  of  necessity  occur  in  electromagnetic 
field  interacting  with  charged  quantum  particles.  Really,  in  quantum  electrodynamics  the  4-current 
density is expressed by (see [41])

)(xΨ   is  not  localized  at  a 
geometrical point but distributed in some way over all space, the electromagnetic field, the interaction 
of which with electron field is governed by Maxwell’s equations (1) with the 4-current density (28), is, 
obviously, the carrier of superluminal signals.

Let us now turn to the physical mechanism of the occurrence of superluminal signals. First of 
all, recall once again that in quantum mechanics the interaction of electromagnetic field with charged 
particles is described not in terms of the fields  E  and  B  but in terms of the scalar and vector potentials 
[41]. This interaction results in the shift of phases of the wave functions of particles, which causes the 
shift  of  interference  fringes  in  electron  diffraction  experiment.  The  phase  displacements  of  wave 
functions  contain  all  physical  information  about  interacting  systems,  which  can  be  transferred  to  any 
distance without the energy and momentum transfer. 

Consider an electric charge  q , which is at rest at the moment of time  t  at a point 

r =

)(0 tr

 in 

, the charge is displaced 
some inertial reference frame. If within the interval of time 
from this point, in some vicinity of it there will occur a magnetic field  B  and a time-dependent electric 
, a trial charge  q′  placed at 
field  E . According to formula (9), as applied to the limiting case 
an observation point  r  is subjected to the electromagnetic field described by the potential

As is seen from (29), the change of the fields  E  and  B  in the vicinity of point

the displacement of the charge  q , will lead to the change in potentials at point  r , which can be situated 
at any distance from 
 the phase of wave function of the 
particle placed in a vicinity of the observation point  r  will change. This means that the trial charge  q′  
and  r  are separated 
“will feel” the displacement of the charge  q  even in the event that the points 
by  a  space-like  interval,  i.e.  under  the  conditions  when  the  light  signal  caused  by  acceleration  of  the 
charge  q   has  no  time  to  reach  the  observation  point  and,  hence,  the  phase  displacement  of  wave 
function takes place in the absence of the energy and momentum transfer from the location point of the 
charge  q  to the observation   point. Superluminal transfer  of information  is caused, thus, by the non-
local relation of the potentials to the fields  E  and  B .

Results  of  this  paper  testify  that  superluminal  signals  inevitably  occur  in  describing  the 
interaction  of  electromagnetic  field  with  charged  particles  on  the  basis  of  Maxwell’s  equations.  This 
raises the question of how it was possible not to notice superluminal signals over almost hundred years 
elapsed after creating STR? The answer is that 

12 

 

 

1.   superluminal signals were, in a sense, ideologically forbidden since the time of creating STR as 
a  subject  contradicting  the  physical  principles  and,  therefore,  this  topic  was  not  worked  out 
properly; 

2.   the  requirement  that  the  equations  for  potentials  be  relativistically  invariant  reliably  masks 
superluminal signals: as may be inferred from an analysis of the problem, if the Lorentz gauge 
is used and, in addition,  the electric charges are treated as point-like particles and calculations 
are  carried  out  within  the  standard  perturbation  theory  (see  [41]),  the  contributions  to  the  4-
potential from superluminal excitations cancel out mutually in any order of perturbation theory, 
so that no evidence of superluminal signals can be found.  

It is necessary to emphasize that in quantum systems, because the 4-current density is described in 
them  by  the  expressions  of  the  type  (28),  superluminal  signaling  occurs  constantly,  in  any  quantum 
processes. Physically, this is due to the fact that the carrier of superluminal signals is the own field of 
potentials which forms a special physical medium filling the whole space and capable of transferring 
information instantaneously to any distances from one material object to another. 

The  own  field  of  particle  seems  to  contain  four  components  according  to  the  four  kinds  of 
interactions  known  at  present  -  electromagnetic,  weak,  strong,  and  gravitational.  Each  of  these 
components is a classical field connecting the particle with surroundings with the help of superluminal 
signals. The role of the own field of potentials in organization of the world is that it transforms particles 
and  bodies  into  the  open  self-organizing  systems  whose  stability  is  provided  by  the  interaction  with 
environment with the help of superluminal signals. Note that the own field as a physical medium has 
little  in  common  with  physical  vacuum  of  standard  quantum  field theory  (see [41]).  One of essential 
differences is that the own field has purely classical character while physical vacuum “is occupied” by 
virtual quantum particles - photons, electrons, electron-positron pairs and others. 

As  Descartes  believed,  there  is  nothing  in  the  world  except  for  the  ether  and  its  whirlwinds. 
According to results of this paper, investigation of Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetic field allow 
one to proceed from philosophical reasoning on the ether as a special physical medium to the detailed 
studying of physical properties and behaviour of the medium at the strict mathematical level. Almost in 
all  investigations,  which  were  carried  out  in  the  twentieth  century  in  the  field  of  quantum 
electrodynamics,  the  Lorentz  gauge  was  used,  which  allowed  one  to  disguise  superluminal  signals. 
Studying  electromagnetic  field  with  the  use  of  generalized  gauge  at 
  will  open  up  a  new, 
mysterious  world  in  which  the  key  role  is  played  by  superluminal  signals.  Solution  of  the  dynamic 
equations  taking  properly  into  account  the  own  fields  will  allow  one  to  establish  the  physical 
mechanisms governing quantum processes with allowance for superluminal signals, to predict the new 
physical  effects  connected  with  these  mechanisms,  and  thereby  to  point  the  new  ways  to  the 
development of engineering.

 The  results  obtained are indicative  of the  possibility of creating  a  qualitatively new  means of 
communication  that  is  based  on  the  use of  superluminal signals  carried by  the own  fields of charged 
particles. By their physical characteristics – by the speed and the range of information transfer, by the 
capacity  to  penetrate  through  obstacles,  by  their  reliability  in  service  -  the  new  communication 
facilities, working on superluminal signals, will be much superior to the now existing ones.

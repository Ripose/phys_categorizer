Abstract 
A new approach to suppress ion feedback in multi-GEM structures is suggested. In this approach, a potential 
difference applied across the gap between two adjacent GEMs has the opposite polarity compared to the standard 
configuration.  In  such  a  gap  structure,  called  Electric  Gate,  the  signal  transfer  from the first to  second GEM  is 
presumably  provided  by  electric  field  lines  still  existing  between  the  holes  of  the  two  GEMs  at  lower  gate 
voltages.  On  the  other  hand,  ion  feedback  between  the  GEMs  turned  out  to  be  substantially  reduced.  We  also 
consider another configuration, called Photoelectric Gate, in which in addition to the Electric Gate configuration, 
a CsI photocathode is deposited on the second GEM. In Photoelectric Gate, ion feedback through the gap is fully 
suppressed  and  the  signal  transfer  through  the  gap  is  provided  by  photoelectric  mechanism  due  to  either 
avalanche  scintillations  in  the  first  GEM  or  proportional  scintillations  in  a  dedicated  electroluminescence  gap 
replacing the first GEM.  Two-Phase Photoelectric Gate with the electroluminescence plate placed in the liquid is 
also proposed for applications in two-phase avalanche detectors.

1.  Introduction 

Ion feedback from the avalanche region to the 
cathode  is  one  of  the  central  problems  in  the 
development  of  Time  Projection  Chambers 
(TPC)  and  gas  photomultipliers.  It  is  desirable 
to  fully  suppress  ion  feedback  to  prevent  field 
distortion  in  the  TPC  drift  volume  [1]  and

is  also  important  for  the  performance  of  two-
phase  avalanche  detectors  [3,4]:  due  to  a  very

detectors  may  find  applications  in  the  field  of 
neutrino  detection,  dark  matter  search  and 
Positron Emission Tomography [4]. 

Using the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) [5] 
as an electron avalanche detector, although does 
not solve the problem, substantially reduces ion 
feedback  in  multi-GEM  structures  [6-12],  in 
particular  compared  to  wire  chambers.  For 
example, the ion feedback fraction in the triple-
GEM detector was measured to be in the range 
from 2% to 8% at a drift field of 0.5 kV/cm and

The  alternative  technique  to  suppress  ion

applying  voltage  pulses  to  wire electrodes [11]

2. Photoelectric Gate 

In  general,  Electric  Gate  and  Photoelectric 
Gate  can  be  defined  as  the  structure  consisting 
of an amplification element and a gap (the gate 
gap),  the  potential  difference  across  the  gap 
having  the  opposite  polarity  compared  to  the 
ion 
standard 
feedback through the gap is blocked.  

configuration.  Accordingly, 

The standard configuration of the multi-GEM 
detector is defined as that in which the potential 
differences  applied  across  all  GEMs  and  gaps 
have  the  same  polarity  (see  for  example  [8]). 
These  gaps  are  the  drift  gap  (between  the 
cathode  and  the  first  GEM),  the  transfer  gaps 
(between  the  GEMs)  and  the  induction  gap 
(between the GEM and the anode). 

 The idea of Photoelectric Gate is explained in 
triple-GEM

detector.    The  transfer  field  ET1  between  the 
first  and  second  GEMs  (GEM1  and  GEM2  in 
Fig.1)  has  the  opposite  direction  compared  to 
the  standard  configuration,  fully  blocking  ion 
feedback  from  the  successive  GEM  elements. 
Now ion feedback to the cathode is defined by 
the  contribution  of  the  first  GEM  only.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  signal  transfer  through  the  gap 
is  provided  by  photoelectric  mechanism: 
avalanche  scintillations in the  holes of the first 
GEM

electrode of the second GEM coated with a CsI 
photocathode sensitive in the VUV region [15].  
Photoelectrons  emitted  from  the  top  electrode 
of  the  second  GEM  are  effectively  collected 
into  its  holes  and  further multiplied.  As shown 
elsewhere  [16],  the  photoelectron  collection 
efficiency  would  approach  100%, 
the 
magnitude  of  the  transfer  field  ET1  would  be 
relatively small, below 0.5 kV/cm.

Apparently,  gas  mixtures  having  high 
scintillation yields in the VUV region should be 
used.  These  are  known  to  be  noble  gases  (He, 
Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe) [17,18] and CF4 [19]. Using 
noble gases is provided by the unique property 
of  GEM  structures  to  operate  in  pure  noble 
gases at high gains [20-22].

Photoelectric Gate. 1GEM-PCB configuration is depicted. 
 

The  experimental  setups  in  these  and  other 
measurements  (Figs.  1,2,5)  included  a  high-
pressure  stainless-steel  vessel,  inside  which  a 
GEM  assembly  was  mounted.  The  GEM  foils 
were produced by the CERN workshop and had 
the  following  parameters:  50  µm  thick  kapton, 
3×3  cm2  active  area,  70  and  55  µm  hole 
diameter  on  the  metal  and  kapton  center 
respectively  and  140  µm  hole  pitch.  In  the 
setups of Figs. 1 and 2, a CsI photocathode of a 
thickness  of  about  2  µm  was  deposited  on  a 
gold-plated  GEM 
foil  using  a  vacuum 
evaporation  equipment.  In  the  setup  of  Fig.  1, 
the inter-GEM gaps were 2 mm. In the setup of 
Fig.2,  the  gap  between  the  GEM  and  the  PCB 
was  2  mm.  The  detectors  were  operated  in  a 
current  mode,  irradiated  with  continuous  X-
rays.  The  cathode,  GEM  and  PCB  electrodes 
were  biased  through  a  resistive  high-voltage 
divider.  

The  cathode  and  anode  currents,  IC  and  IA, 
were measured in the circuits of the cathode and 
the  last  electrode,  respectively,  as  shown  in 
Figs. 1,2 and 5. The gain value is defined as the 
anode current divided by the primary ionization 
current  in  the  drift  gap,  IPC.  The  latter  was 
determined  in  special  measurements,  when  the 
drift gap was operated in an ionization mode. In 
the  anode  current,  the  signal  induced  by  X-ray 
conversion in the drift gap was only accounted 
for:  for  that,  the  contribution  of  the  currents 
induced  by  X-ray  conversion  in  the  successive 
gaps  were  determined  in  special  measurements 
and then subtracted.  

Fig.  3  shows  the  gain  of  the  1GEM±PCB 
detector  (shown  in  Fig.2)  as  a  function  of  the 
PCB voltage at a certain constant GEM voltage, 
in Kr and Ar+10%CF4. In Kr, the photoelectric 
signal  was  observed  in  the  1GEM-PCB  mode. 
Its  value  at  VPCB=-300V,  corresponding  to  the 
induction field of 1.5 kV/cm, was by two orders 
the

In  Ar+10%CF4,  the  photoelectric  signal  was 
not  observed  at  all,  indicating  that  the  gain 
transfer  factor  in  this  mixture  is  much  smaller 
than  that  in  Kr,  apparently  due  to  the  lower 
scintillation  yield  in  CF4  compared  to  noble 
gases [19].

confirmed:  in  Kr  the  gain  in  the  1GEM-PCB

coated with a CsI photocathode. 
 

We  also  tested  the  triple-GEM  detector  with 
Photoelectric  Gate  shown  in  Fig.  1,  i.e.  the 
(1±2)GEM detector, in He at 5 atm. Similarly to 
the  previous  measurements,  the  gain  transfer 
factor  of 
(1-2)GEM 
(photoelectric) mode turned out to be small: of 
about 1/30.

Such a small value of the gain transfer factor 
is  not  surprising.  Indeed,  if  to  take  realistic 
values  of  terms  in  expression  (3),  εQE=0.2, 
nP=1,  fSA=1/3  and  εBS=1/3,  the  transfer  factor 
would be t~1/50, which is close to the observed 
value.  Obviously,  the  low  efficiency  of  the 
signal transfer does not allow one to effectively 
suppress ion feedback in Photoelectric Gate due 
to the large contribution of the first GEM. 

 
3. Electric Gate 

If  to  look  carefully  at  Fig.  3,  one  can  notice 
that  the  avalanche  (electric)  signal  still  exists 
when  the  PCB  voltage  becomes  negative  and 
small in magnitude. We studied this effect using 
the triple-GEM detector and the structure called 
Electric Gate, shown in Fig. 5. 

 

 

In  contrast  to  Photoelectric  Gate,  the  CsI 
photocathode  is  not  used  in  Electric  Gate  and 
the  contribution  of  the  photoelectric  signal  is 
not  important.  Similarly  to  Photoelectric  Gate, 
the potential difference (and the electric field at 
the  average)  across  the  gate  gap  has  the 
opposite  polarity  compared  to  the  standard 
configuration, but its magnitude is rather small, 
of the order of 10 V. In these measurements, the 
gate  gap  was  1.6  mm  and  the  gas  filling  was 
either  He  at  5  atm,  of  a  purity  of  99.99%,  or 
Ar+10%CF4  at  1  atm.  The  experimental 
procedure  was  similar  to  that  described  in  the 
previous section. It should be remarked that the 
high  gain  operation  of  GEM  detectors  in  He 
observed earlier [21] and in the current work is 
most  probably  provided  by  the  Penning  effect 
in impurities [22,26].

configuration is depicted. 
 

Fig. 6 shows the anode and cathode currents, 
in  terms  of  the  gain  (i.e.  normalized  to  the 
primary 
ion 
ionization  current),  and 
feedback  fraction  in  the  (1±2)GEM  detector  as 
a function of the voltage applied across the gate 
gap.  The  latter  is  designated  as  ∆VEG  and  is 
equal  to  VGEM1b  in  Fig.  5.  The  data  were 
obtained  at  certain  constant  GEM  voltages,  in 
He at 5 atm.

can see that just the central regions of the GEM 
holes, in which the electric field is the highest, 
have the connection by the field lines. The gain 
transfer  factor  is  relatively  large  in  these 
conditions, because electron avalanches tend to 
develop  just  in  the  high  field  region.  On  the 
other  hand,  the  current  of  ions  back-drifting 
from  the  second  to  first  GEM  turned  out  to  be 
substantially reduced, resulting in the reduction 
of ion feedback. Presumably this effect exploits 
the

electrons and ions.

compared to the horizontal scale. 

 
Simulations  showed  that  at  gate  voltages 
higher  than  20  V  the  gate  is  fully  “closed”: 
there are no field lines between the GEM holes 
any more. At these voltages the anode signal is

feedback 
substantially decreases and reaches a minimum 
at VGEM1b=10 V: here ion feedback is by almost 
an  order  of  magnitude  smaller  than  that  in  the 
3GEM  mode.  At  the  same  time,  the  gain 
transfer  factor  here  is  still  large  enough.  That 
means that ion feedback might be substantially 
reduced  in  Electric  Gate  operated  at  low 
voltages. 

The  transfer  of  the  electron  signal  from  the 
first  to  second  GEM  in  the  (1-2)GEM  mode  is 
presumably provided by the fact that there still 
exist  some  field  lines  between  the  holes  of  the 
adjacent GEMs, when the gate voltage is small 
in magnitude. This takes place because the high 
field  regions  in  the  central  parts  of  the  GEM 
holes  tend  to  be  linked  together  by  the  field 
lines through the gap. 

This  is  clear  from  Fig.  7,  showing  the  drift 
paths  of  negative  charges,  generated  uniformly 
across  the  hole  of  the  first  GEM,  at  a  gate 
voltage of 10 V (diffusion is disregarded). This 
plot  was  obtained  using  MAXWELL  [27]  and 
GARFIELD  [28]  simulation  programs1.  One

considerably  reduced.  It  is  interesting  however 
that  it  still  exists  (see  Fig.  6).  Most  probably, 
the  gate  operates  here  in  the  photoelectric 
mode, like that shown in Fig. 1, provided by the 
fact  that  the  quantum  efficiency  of  the  copper 
electrode of the second GEM is high enough (of 
the  order  of  10%) 
in  the  region  of  He 
scintillations. 

Fig. 8 compares the gain characteristics, Figs. 
9  and  10  the  ion  feedback  characteristics  and 
Fig. 11 the anode signals in the (1-2)GEM and 
3GEM  detectors,  in  He  and  Ar+10%CF4.  In 
these figures, the gate voltage in the (1-2)GEM 
mode  was  proportional  to  the  GEM  voltage: 
∆VEG=0.038∆VGEM.  This  corresponds  to  gate 
voltages of about 7-10 V in He and 13-17 V in 
Ar+10%CF4. In both mixtures the gain transfer 
factor,  estimated  from  expression  (5),  is  of  the 
order of 1/10 at gains of 104 (see Fig. 8), which 
is substantially larger then that in Photoelectric 
Gate.  In  the  3GEM  mode,  the  voltages  across 
each GEM and each inter-GEM gap were equal.

gain  of  104  is  equal  to  0.39  and  0.35  kV/cm  in  the  (1-

The  effect  of  Electric  Gate  on  reducing  ion 
feedback is distinctly seen in both mixtures: at a 
gain of 104 the ion feedback fraction in the (1-

compared to that in the 3GEM mode, in He and  
Ar+10%CF4 respectively (Figs. 9 and 10). 

The  small  value  of  the  transfer  field  in  the 
gate  gap  in  the  (1-2)GEM  mode  may  result  in 
an increase of the avalanche signal width at the 
anode.  This  was  in  particular  observed  in  He: 
the  rise-times  of  the  anode  pulse  in  Fig.  11, 
corresponding  to  the  width  of  the  avalanche 
signal,  is  about  3.2  µs  in  the  (1-2)GEM  mode, 
which is by a factor of 4 larger that that in the 
3GEM  mode.  On 
in 
Ar+10%CF4  the  difference  in  the  signal  width 
between  (1-2)GEM  and  3GEM  modes  was 
negligible. 
 

the  other  hand, 

It is interesting that the ion feedback fraction 
depends on the gain as G-2/3 (here G is the total 
gain) in a wide gain range (Figs. 9 and 10). This 
indicates  that  the  major  contribution  to  ion 
feedback is provided by the first GEM, since it

This was realized by operating the (1-2)GEM

is about a factor of 20 smaller compared to the 
3GEM  mode.  Now  the  ion  feedback  fraction 
tends  to  depend  on  the  gain  as  G-1,  since  it  is 
mostly determined by the constant contribution

problems 

In  this  section  we  discuss  possible  solutions 
of 
tested 
experimentally).  We  suggest  replacing  the  first 
GEM  by  a  dedicated  electroluminescence  gap 
formed  by  two  wire  meshes  (see  Fig.  13).  In 
that way, ion feedback from the first element is 
fully  eliminated,  since  there  is  no  electron 
avalanching in the gap any more. Photoelectric 
mechanism of the gain transfer is now provided 
by  proportional  scintillations  in  the  gap  under 
moderate  electric  field.  For  that,  heavy  noble 
gases should be used as the gas filling, namely 
Ar,  Kr  and  Xe,  since  these  are  known  to 
effectively  produce  proportional  scintillations 
[29].  

The  gap  should  be  thick  enough  to  produce 
enough  light.  For  example,  a  1  cm  thick 
electroluminescence  gap  can  produce  as  much 
as  200  VUV  photons  per  electron  in  Xe  at 
atmospheric  pressure,  at  a  field  of  4  kV/cm 
[29,30]. Such amount of photons would provide 
the  efficient  signal  transfer  through  the  gate: 
according  to  (3)  the  gain  transfer  factor  would 
exceed  unity  in  this  case.  In  addition,  the 
scintillation  yield  of  the  gate  can  be  further 
increased by increasing the gas pressure and the 
gap voltage. It should be remarked that the role 

 

 

of 
the  electroluminescence  gap  at  higher 
pressures  could  presumably  be  played  by  the 
so-called  Thick  GEM  [31]  operated 
in  a 
proportional scintillation mode.

Apparently, 

Photoelectric  Gate  with 
the 
electroluminescence  gap  would  satisfy 
condition  of  ultimate  suppression  of 
ion 
feedback (2). However, its spatial resolution (of 
the  order  of  cm)  and  timing  resolution  will  be 
limited  due  to  the  large  thickness  of  the 
electroluminescence  gap.  The  elegant  solution 
to solve this problem is presented in Fig. 14: the 
electroluminescence  gap  is  placed  in  the  noble 
liquid,  which  would  allow  decreasing 
its 
thickness  considerably.  Indeed,  since  the  noble 
liquid  density  is  by  a  factor  of  500-800  higher 
than  that  of  the  noble  gas  at  atmospheric 
pressure,  the  electroluminescence  gap  can  be 
made  thinner  appropriately,  i.e.  can  be  as  thin 
as  50  µm.  At  the  same  time  the  multi-GEM 
multiplier is kept in the gas phase. Thus we are 
coming to the idea of Two-Phase Photoelectric 
Gate (see Fig. 14). This concept is relevant only 
to  two-phase  avalanche  detectors  mentioned  in 
the Introduction [3,4].

  5. Summary 

this  approach, 

In this paper we suggested a new approach to 
suppress ion feedback in multi-GEM structures. 
the  potential  difference 
In 
applied  across  the  gap  between  two  adjacent 
GEMs  has  the  opposite  polarity  compared  to 
the standard configuration. Such a gap structure 
is called Electric Gate or Photoelectric Gate.  

In  Electric  Gate,  the  signal  transfer  from  the 
first to second GEM is presumably provided by 
electric  field  lines  still  existing  between  the 
holes  of  the  two GEMs at lower  gate  voltages. 
On  the  other  hand,  ion  feedback  between  the 
GEMs  turned  out  to  be  substantially  reduced: 
the  ion  feedback  fraction  in  the  triple-GEM 
detector  having  Electric  Gate  was  measured  to 
be  as  low  as  3×10-3  at  a  gain  of  104  and  drift 
field  of  0.4  kV/cm.  This  is  by  a  factor  of  20 
lower  than  that  in  the  standard  triple-GEM 
configuration.  The  optimization  of  the  gate 
parameters,  in  particular  the  gap  thickness, 
GEM  and  gate  voltages,  GEM  hole  pitch  and 
gas composition, may help to further reduce ion 
feedback. 

We  also  presented  the  idea  of  Photoelectric 
Gate,  in  which  in  addition  to  the  Electric  Gate 
configuration,  a  CsI  photocathode  is  deposited 
on the second GEM. In Photoelectric Gate, ion 
feedback  through  the  gap  is  fully  suppressed 
and  the  signal  transfer  through  the  gap  is 
provided  by  photoelectric  mechanism,  due  to 
either avalanche scintillations in the holes of the 
first  GEM  or  proportional  scintillations  in  a 
dedicated  electroluminescence  gap  replacing 
the  first  GEM.  The  modification  of  the  latter 
is  Two-Phase  Photoelectric  Gate, 
structure 
where the role of the electroluminescence gap is 
played  by  a  thin  electroluminescence  plate 
placed in the liquid; it is relevant to two-phase 
the 
avalanche  detectors.  At

In  this  concept  a  thin  electroluminescence 
the  GEM-  or  MHSP-like 
plate,  made  of 
structure  and  operated 
in  a  proportional 
scintillation  mode  in  the  liquid,  acts  as  the 
electroluminescence gap. Just a small thickness 
of  the  electroluminescence  plate  (~50  µm), 
realized here by the GEM or MHSP structure, is 
of  primary  importance  since  the  electric  fields 
needed  to  start  electroluminescence  in  noble 
liquids  are  above  100  kV/cm  [32],  which  are 
not  easy  to  reach  in  thicker  structures.  In 
particular,  proportional  scintillations  in  liquid 
Xe were observed using very thin wires [33]. A 
CsI  coated  GEM,  providing  photoelectric 
mechanism of the gain transfer through the gate 
gap,  is  placed  in  saturated  vapor  above  the 
liquid.  The  liquid-gas  interface  is  therefore 
contained within the gate gap. The direction of 
the  electric  field  in  the  gate  gap,  between  the 
electroluminescence plate and the first GEM, is 
reversed 
standard 
configuration, thus fully blocking ion feedback 
through the gap.

allows  one  to  do  without  electron  emission

avalanche  detectors  at  high  gains,  in  particular

Abstract 

Power  spectra  of  human  DNA  base  C+G  frequency  distribution  in  all  available  contiguous 
sections  exhibit the universal inverse  power law form of the  statistical normal distribution for 
the 24 chromosomes. Inverse power law form for power spectra of space-time fluctuations is 
generic  to  dynamical  systems  in  nature  and  indicate  long-range  space-time  correlations.  A 
recently  developed  general  systems  theory  predicts  the  observed  non-local  connections  as 
intrinsic  to  quantumlike  chaos  governing  space-time  fluctuations  of  dynamical  systems.  The 
model predicts the following. (1) The quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern for the nested coiled 
structure  of  the  DNA  molecule  in  the  chromosome  resulting  in  maximum  packing  efficiency. 
(2) The DNA molecule functions as a unified whole fuzzy logic network with ordered two-way 
signal  transmission  between  the  coding  and  non-coding  regions.  Recent  studies  indicate 
influence of non-coding regions on functions of coding regions in the DNA molecule.

1. Introduction 

Spatially  extended  dynamical  systems  in  nature  exhibit  fractal  space-time 
fluctuations  associated  with  inverse  power  law  spectrum  or  1/f  noise, 
signifying  long-range  space-time  correlations  or  memory,  identified  as  self-
organized  criticality  (Bak,  1988;  Goldberger  et  al.,  2002; West,  2004;  Milotti, 
2004;.  Wooley  and  Herbert,  2005;  Wang  et  al.,  2006;  Li,  2007).  Selfsimilar 
space-time fluctuations, now identified as fractals, have earlier been reported 
and  studied  in  separate  branches  of  science  till  very  recently  (1980s)  when 
they  were  recognized  as  universal  phenomena  under  the  new  science  of 
‘nonlinear dynamics and chaos’. The multidisciplinary nature of investigations 
will  help  gain  new  insights  and  develop  mathematical  and  statistical 
techniques and analytical tools for understanding and quantifying the physics 
of  the  observed  long-range  correlations in  dynamical  systems in  nature. The 
physics  of  dynamical  systems  therefore  comes  under  the  broad  category  of 
general  systems  theory.  The  subunits  of  the  system  function  as  a  unified 
whole two-way communication and control network with global (system level) 
control/response  to  local  functions/stimuli, thereby  possessing  the  criteria  for 
a robust system (Csete and Doyle, 2002; Kitano, 2002; 2004). Kitano (2002) 
makes the  point that  robustness is a property  of an  entire system; it may be 
that no individual component or process within a system would be robust, but 
the  system-wide  architecture  still  provides  robust  behavior.  This  presents  a

for  analysis,  since  elucidating  such  behaviors  can  be 

DNA  sequences  represent  a  condensed  archive  of  information  on  the 
structure  and  function  of  DNA,  both  as  a  complex  machinery  inside  the  cell 
and  as  the  genetic  memory  for  the  entire  organism.  DNA  may  be  taken  as 
representative  of  the  simultaneous  needs  of  order  and  plasticity  of  living 
systems.  Therefore,  the  characterisation  of  the  relation  between  DNA 
structure  and  function  and  the  statistical  properties  of  the  distribution  of  its 
nucleotides  may  offer  us  a  reliable  basis  for  the  further  development  of  a 
holistic  approach.  The  statistical  properties  of  DNA  sequences  have  been 
studied extensively in the last 15 years. The general result that emerges from 
these studies is that DNA statistics is characterised by short-range and long-
range  correlations  which  are  linked  to  the  functional  role  of  the  sequences. 
Specifically,  while  coding  sequences  seem  to  be  almost  uncorrelated,  non-
coding  sequences  show  long-range  power-law  correlations  typical  of  scale 
invariant systems (Buiatti and Buiatti, 2004). 

During the late 1960s papers began appearing that showed eukaryotic 
DNA  contained  large  quantities  of  repetitive  DNA  which  did  not  appear  to 
code for proteins. By the early 1970s, the term “junk DNA” had been coined to 
refer to this non-coding DNA. Junk DNA seemed like an appropriate term for 
DNA  cluttering  up  the  genome  while  contributing  in  no  way  to  the  protein 
coding  function  of  DNA;  yet  there seemed to  be  so  much  of  this  non-coding 
DNA that its significance could not be ignored. Non-coding DNA makes up a 
significant portion of the total genomic DNA in many eukaryotes. For example, 
older  sources  estimate  97%  of  the  human  genome  to  be  non-coding  DNA, 
while the recently published sequence data increases the estimates to 98.9%

sequences  and  do  not  code  for  proteins  themselves  along  with  other  non-
coding DNA, play an important role in repression of genes and the sequential 
switching  of  genes  during  development,  suggesting  that  up  to  15  %  of  “junk 
DNA” functions in this vital role Standish (2002).

In this paper it is shown that the spectra of human chromosomes 1 to 
24 DNA base C+G frequency distributions follows the universal inverse power 
law  form  of  the  statistical  normal  distribution  consistent  with  predictions  of  a 
recently developed general systems theory model for dynamical systems of all 
space-time scales.  

2. General systems theory concepts 

In summary (Selvam, 1990; Selvam and Fadnavis, 1998), the model is based 
on Townsend’s concept (Townsend, 1956) that large eddy structures form in 
turbulent  flows  as  envelopes  of  enclosed  turbulent  eddies.  Such  a  simple 
concept  that  space-time  averaging  of  small-scale  structures  gives  rise  to 
large-scale  space-time  fluctuations  leads  to  the  following  important  model 
predictions. 

2.1 Quantumlike chaos in turbulent fluid flows 

Since the large eddy is but the integrated mean of enclosed turbulent eddies, 
the  eddy  energy  (kinetic)  distribution  follows  statistical  normal  distribution 

3 

 

 

according to the Central Limit Theorem (Ruhla, 1992). Such a result, that the 
additive  amplitudes  of  the  eddies,  when  squared,  represent  probability 
distributions is found in the subatomic dynamics of quantum systems such as 
the electron or  photon. Atmospheric flows, or, in general turbulent fluid flows 
follow quantumlike chaos. 

2.2 Dynamic memory (information) circulation network 

The  root  mean  square  (r.m.s.)  circulation  speeds  W  and 
turbulent eddies of respective radii R and r are related as 

∗w   of  large  and

(1) 

Eq.(1)  is  a  statement  of  the  law  of  conservation  of  energy  for  eddy 
growth in fluid flows and implies a two-way ordered energy flow between the 
larger  and  smaller  scales.  Microscopic  scale  perturbations  are  carried 
permanently as internal circulations of progressively larger eddies. Fluid flows 
therefore act as dynamic memory circulation networks with intrinsic long-term 
memory of short-term fluctuations.  

2.3 Quasicrystalline structure 

The  flow  structure  consists  of  an  overall  logarithmic  spiral  trajectory  with 
Fibonacci winding number and quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern for internal 
structure (Fig.1). Primary perturbation ORO (Fig.1) of time period T generates 
return  circulation  OR1RO  which,  in  turn,  generates  successively  larger 
circulations OR1R2, OR2R3, OR3R4, OR4R5, etc., such that the successive radii 
form  the  Fibonacci  mathematical  number  series,  i.e.,  OR1/ORO=  OR2/OR1  = 
…….=  τ  where  τ  is  the  golden  mean  equal  to  (1+√5)/2≈1.618.  The  flow 
structure  therefore  consists  of  a  nested  continuum  of  vortices,  i.e.,  vortices 
within vortices. 

The  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling  pattern  with  five-fold  symmetry  has 
been  identified  as  quasicrystalline  structure  in  condensed  matter  physics 
(Janssen,  1988).  The  self-organized  large  eddy  growth  dynamics,  therefore, 
spontaneously  generates  an  internal  structure  with  the  five-fold  symmetry  of 
the dodecahedron, which is referred to as the icosahedral symmetry. Recently 
the carbon macromolecule C60, formed by condensation from a carbon vapour 
jet,  was  found  to  exhibit  the  icosahedral  symmetry  of  the  closed  soccer  ball 
and has been named Buckminsterfullerene or footballene (Curl and Smalley, 
1991). Self-organized quasicrystalline pattern formation therefore exists at the 
molecular  level  also  and  may  result  in  condensation  of  specific  biochemical 
structures  in  biological  media.  Logarithmic  spiral  formation  with  Fibonacci 
winding number and five-fold symmetry possess maximum packing efficiency 
for  component  parts  and  are  manifested  strikingly  in  plant  Phyllotaxis  (Jean, 
1994).

logarithmic spiral trajectory OROR1R2R3R4R5 simultaneously in clockwise and anti-
clockwise  directions  with  the  quasi-periodic  Penrose  tiling  pattern  for  the  internal 
structure

The  dominant  quasi-periodicities  are  equal  to  2.2T,  3.6T,  5.8T,  9.5T, 
……for values of n = -1, 0, 1, 2,…, respectively (Eq.2). Space-time integration 
of  turbulent  fluctuations  results  in  robust  broadband  dominant  periodicities 
which  are  functions  of  the  primary  perturbation  time  period  T  alone  and  are 
independent  of  exact  details  (chemical,  electrical,  physical  etc.)  of  turbulent 
fluctuations.  Persistent  periodic  energy  pumping  at  fixed  time  intervals 
(period)  T  in  a  fluid  medium  generates  self-sustaining  continuum  of  eddies 
and  results  in  apparent  nonlinear  chaotic  fluctuations  in  the  fluid  medium. 
Also,  such  global  scale  oscillations  in  the  unified  network  are  not  affected 
appreciably by failure of localized microscale circulation networks. 

Wavelengths (or periodicities) close to the model predicted values have 
been reported in weather and climate variability (Selvam and Fadnavis, 1998), 
prime  number  distribution  (Selvam,  2001a),  Riemann  zeta  zeros  (non-trivial) 
distribution (Selvam, 2001b), Drosophila DNA base sequence (Selvam, 2002), 
stock  market  economics  (Selvam,  2003),  Human  chromosome  1  DNA  base 
sequence (Selvam, 2004). 

Macroscale  coherent  structures  emerge  by  space-time  integration  of 
microscopic  domain  fluctuations  in  fluid  flows.  Such  a  concept  of  the 
autonomous growth of atmospheric eddy continuum with ordered energy flow 
between  the  scales  is  analogous  to  Prigogine’s  (Prigogine  and  Stengers, 
1988) concept of the spontaneous emergence of order and organization out of 
apparent disorder and chaos through a process of self-organization.

2.4.1 Emergence of order and coherence in biology 

The  problem  of  emergence  of  macroscopic  variables  out  of  microscopic 
dynamics is of crucial relevance in biology (Vitiello, 1992). Biological systems 
rely  on  a combination of network  and the specific elements involved (Kitano, 
2002).  The  notion  that  membership  in  a  network  could  confer  stability 
emerged from Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s description of general systems theory 
in  the  1930s  and  Norbert  Wieners  description  of  cybernetics  in  the  1940s. 
General systems theory focused in part on the notion of flow, postulating the 
existence  and significance of flow equilibria. In contrast to Cannon’s concept 
that  mechanisms  should  yield  homeostasis,  general  systems  theory  invited 
biologists  to  consider  an  alternative  model  of  homeodynamics  in  which 
nonlinear,  non-equilibrium  processes  could  provide  stability,  if  not  constancy 
(Buchman, 2002).  

The  cell  dynamical  system  model  for  coherent  pattern  formation  in 
turbulent flows summarized earlier (Section 2) may provide a general systems 
theory  for  biological  complexity.  General  systems  theory  is  a  logical-
mathematical  field,  the  subject  matter  of  which  is  the  formulation  and 
deduction  of  those  principles  which  are  valid  for  ‘systems’  in  general, 
whatever  the  nature  of  their  component  elements  or  the  relations  or  ‘forces’ 
between them (Bertalanffy, 1968; Peacocke, 1989; Klir, 1993). 

2.5 Long-range spatiotemporal correlations (coherence) 

The  logarithmic  spiral  flow  pattern  enclosing  the  vortices  OROR1,  OR1R2,  … 
may  be  visualized  as  a  continuous  smooth  rotation  of  the  phase  angle  θ 
(ROOR1, ROOR2, … etc.) with increase in period. The phase angle θ for each 
2W  (Eq.1), 
stage of growth is equal to  Rr
the variance representing the intensity of fluctuations. The phase angle gives 
a measure  of coherence or correlation in space-time fluctuations. The model 
predicted  continuous  smooth  rotation  of  phase  angle  with  increase  in  period 
length associated with logarithmic spiral flow structure is analogous to Berry’s 
phase (Berry, 1988; Kepler et al., 1991) in quantum systems. 

 and is proportional to the variance 

2.6 Universal spectrum of fluctuations 

Conventional  power  spectral  analysis  will  resolve  such  a  logarithmic  spiral 
flow  trajectory  as  a  continuum  of  eddies  (broadband  spectrum)  with  a 
progressive increase in phase angle. The power spectrum, plotted on log-log 
scale  as  variance  versus  frequency  (period)  will  represent  the  probability 
density corresponding to normalized standard deviation t given by

In the above Eq. (3) L is the period in years and 

50T  is the period up to 
which the cumulative percentage contribution to total variance is equal to 50. 
The above expression for normalized standard deviation t follows from model 
prediction of logarithmic spiral flow structure and model concept of successive 
growth structures by space-time averaging.

Fluctuations  of  all  scales  therefore  self-organize  to  form  the  universal

smaller  scales  and  seen  as  long-range  space-time correlations,  namely self-
organized criticality. Atmospheric flows self-organize to form a unified network 
with  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling  pattern  for  internal  structure  (Fig.1), 
which provide long-range (non-local) space-time connections.

manifestation of energy associated with bidirectional energy flow intrinsic to eddy

3. Applications of the general systems theory concepts to 

genomic DNA base sequence structure 

DNA  sequences,  the  blueprint  of  all  essential  genetic  information,  are 
polymers  consisting  of  two  complementary  strands  of  four  types  of  bases: 
adenine  (A),  cytosine  (C),  guanine  (G)  and  thymine  (T).  Among  the  four 
bases,  the  presence  of  A  on  one  strand  is  always  paired  with  T  on  the 
opposite strand, forming a “base pair” with 2 hydrogen bonds. Similarly, G and 
C  are  complementary  to  one  another,  while  forming  a  base  pair  with  3 
hydrogen bonds. Consequently, one may characterize AT base-pairs as weak 
bases and GC base-pairs as strong bases. In addition, the frequency of A(G) 

 

8 

on  a  single  strand  is  approximately  equal  to  the  frequency  of  T(C)  on  the 
same  strand,  a  phenomenon  that  has  been  termed  “strand  symmetry”  or 
“Chargaff’s  second  parity”.  Therefore,  DNA  sequences  can  be  transformed 
into  sequences  of  weak  W  (A  or  T)  and  strong  S  (G  or  C)  bases  (Li  and 
Holste,  2004).  The  SW  mapping  rule  is  particularly  appropriate  to  analyze 
genome-wide  correlations;  this  rule  corresponds  to  the  most  fundamental 
partitioning of the four bases into their natural pairs in the double helix (G+C, 
A+T).  The  composition  of  base  pairs,  or  GC  level,  is  thus  a  strand-
independent property of a DNA molecule and is related to important physico-
chemical  properties  of  the  chain  (Bernaola-Galvan  et  al.,  2002).  The  C+G 
content  (isochore)  studies  have  been  done  earlier  (Bernardi,  et  al.,  1985; 
Ikemura, 1985.; Ikemura and Aota, 1988; Bernardi, G., 1989). The full story of 
how  DNA  really  functions  is  not  merely  what  is  written  on  the  sequence  of 
base  pairs.  The  DNA  functions  involve  information  transmission  over  many 
length scales ranging from a few to several hundred nanometers (Ball, 2003). 

One  of  the  major  goals  in  DNA  sequence  analysis  is  to  gain  an 
understanding  of  the  overall  organization  of  the  genome,  in  particular,  to 
analyze  the  properties  of  the  DNA  string  itself.  Long-range  correlations  in 
DNA  base  sequence  structure,  which  give  rise  to  1/f  spectra  have  been 
identified  (Fukushima  et  al.,  2002;  Azad  et  al.,  2002).  Such  long-range 
correlations in space-time fluctuations is very common in nature and Li (2007) 
has given an extensive and informative bibliography of the observed 1/f noise 
or  1/f  spectra,  where  f  is  the  frequency,  in biological,  physical, chemical  and 
other dynamical systems. The long-range correlations in nucleotide sequence 
could  in  principle  be  explained  by  the  coexistence  of  many  different  length 
scales.  The  advantage  of  spectral  analysis  is  to  reveal  patterns  hidden  in  a 
direct correlation function. The quality of the 1/f spectra differs greatly among 
sequences.  Different  DNA  sequences  do  not  exhibit  the  same  power 
spectrum.  

The  concentration  of  genes  is  correlated  with  the  C+G  density.  The 
spatial  distribution  of  C+G  density  can  be  used  to  give  an  indication  of  the 
location  of  genes.  The  final  goal  is  to  eventually  learn  the  ‘genome 
organization  principles’  (Li,  1997).  The  coding  sequences  of  most  vertebrate 
genes  are  split  into  segments  (exons)  which  are  separated  by  noncoding 
intervening  sequences  (introns).  A  very  small  minority  of  human  genes  lack 
noncoding introns and are very small genes (Strachan and Read, 1996). 

fluctuations  at  different 

Li  (2002)  reports  that  spectral  analysis  shows  that  there  are  GC 
content 
isochore  (relatively 
homogeneous)  sequences.  Fluctuations  of  all  size  scales  coexist  in  a 
hierarchy  of  domains  within  domains  (Li  et  al.,  2003).  Li  and  Holste  (2005) 
have recently identified universal 1/f spectra and diverse correlation structures 
in Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) content of all human chromosomes.

In  the  following  it  is  shown  that  the  frequency  distribution  of  Human 
chromosome  1  TO  24  DNA  bases  C+G  concentration  per  10bp  (non-
overlapping)  follows  the  model  prediction  (Section  2)  of  self-organized 
criticality or quantumlike chaos implying long-range spatial correlations in the 
distribution of bases C+G along the DNA base sequence.

4. Data and Analysis 

4.1 Data 

The  Human  chromosomes  1  to  24  DNA  base  sequence  was  obtained  from 
the  entrez  Databases,  Homo  sapiens  Genome  (build  36  Version  1)  at 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez. The total number of contiguous data sets, 
each  containing  a  minimum  of  70  000  base  pairs,  chosen  for  the  study  are 
given in Fig. 3 for the chromosomes 1 to 24. 

4.2 Power spectral analyses: variance and phase spectra 

The number of times base C and also base G, i.e., (C+G), occur in successive 
blocks  of  10  bases  were  determined  in  successive  length  sections  of  70000 
base pairs giving a C+G frequency distribution series of 7000 values for each 
data set. The power spectra of frequency distribution of C+G bases (per 10bp) 
in  the  data  sets  were  computed  accurately  by  an  elementary,  but  very 
powerful method of analysis developed by Jenkinson (1977) which provides a 
quasi-continuous  form  of  the  classical  periodogram  allowing  systematic 
allocation  of  the  total  variance  and  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  data  series  to 
logarithmically  spaced  elements  of  the  frequency  range  (0.5,  0).  The 
cumulative  percentage  contribution  to  total  variance  was  computed  starting 
from the high frequency side of the spectrum. The power spectra were plotted 
as cumulative percentage contribution to total variance versus the normalized 
standard deviation t equal to  ((((
 where L is the period in years 
T
and 
50T   is  the  period  up  to  which  the  cumulative  percentage  contribution  to 
total variance is equal to 50 (Eq. (3)). The corresponding phase spectra were 
computed as the cumulative percentage contribution to total rotation (Section 
2.6). The statistical chi-square test (Spiegel, 1961)  was  applied to  determine 
the  ‘goodness  of  fit’  of  variance  and  phase  spectra  with  statistical  normal 
distribution.  Details  of  data  sets  and  results  of  power  spectral  analyses  are 
given  in  Fig.  3  as  averages  for  each  of  the  24  chromosomes.  The  average 
variance and phase spectra for the data sets in each of the 24 chromosomes 
(Fig. 3) are given in Fig. 4.

4.3 Power spectral analyses: dominant periodicities 

The general systems theory predicts the broadband power spectrum of fractal 
fluctuations  will  have  embedded  dominant  wavebands, 
the  bandwidth 
increasing  with  wavelength,  and  the  wavelengths  being  functions  of  the 
golden  mean  (Eq.2).  The  first  13  values  of  the  model  predicted  (Selvam, 
1990; Selvam and Fadnavis, 1998) dominant peak wavelengths are 2.2, 3.6, 
5.8, 9.5, 15.3,  24.8,  40.1,  64.9,  105.0,  167.0,  275,  445.0  and  720 in  units  of 
the  block  length  10bp  (base  pairs)  in  the  present  study.  The  dominant  peak 
wavelengths were grouped into 13 class intervals 2 - 3, 3 - 4, 4 - 6, 6 - 12, 12 - 
20, 20 - 30, 30 - 50, 50 - 80, 80 – 120, 120 – 200, 200 – 300, 300 – 600, 600 - 
1000 (in units of 10bp block lengths) to include the model predicted dominant 
peak  length  scales  mentioned  above.  The  class  intervals  increase  in  size 
progressively  to  accommodate  model  predicted  increase  in  bandwidth

(Eq. 3). The observed frequency distribution of dominant eddies follow closely 
the computed percentage contribution to total variance.

4.3.1 Peak wavelength versus bandwidth 

The model predicts that the apparently irregular fractal fluctuations contribute 
to  the  ordered  growth  of  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling  pattern  with  an 
overall  logarithmic  spiral  trajectory  such  that  the  successive  radii  lengths 
follow  the  Fibonacci  mathematical  series.  Conventional  power  spectral 
analyses  resolves  such  a  spiral  trajectory  as  an  eddy  continuum  with 
embedded  dominant  wavebands,  the  bandwidth  increasing  with  wavelength. 
The  progressive  increase  in  the  radius  of  the  spiral  trajectory  generates  the 
θd   in  phase  angle  equal  to 
eddy  bandwidth  proportional  to  the  increment 
 is directly proportional to the

Figure 4: The average variance and phase spectra of frequency distribution of bases C+G in 
Human chromosomes 1 to 24 for the data sets given in Fig. 3. The power spectra 
were computed as cumulative percentage contribution to total variance versus the 
normalized  standard  deviation  t  equal  to  (logL/logT50)  –1  where  L  is  the  period  in 
years and T50  is  the  period up to which the  cumulative percentage  contribution  to 
total variance is equal to 50. The corresponding phase spectra were computed as 
the cumulative percentage contribution to total rotation (Section 2.6).

5. Discussions 

In  summary,  a  majority  of  the  data  sets  (Fig.  3)  exhibit  the  model  predicted 
quantumlike  chaos  for  fractal  fluctuations  since  the  variance  and  phase 
spectra follow each other closely and also follow the universal inverse power 
law form of the statistical normal distribution signifying long-range correlations 
or  coherence  in  the  overall  frequency  distribution  pattern  of  the  DNA  bases 
C+G  in  Human  chromosomes  1  to  24.  Such  non-local  connections  or 
‘memory’  in  the  spatial  pattern  is  a  natural  consequence  of  the  model 
predicted Fibonacci spiral enclosing the space filling quasicrystalline structure 
of the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern for fractal fluctuations of dynamical 
systems. Further, the broadband power spectra exhibit dominant wavelengths 
closely corresponding to the model predicted (Fig. 1, Eq. 2 and Fig. 4) nested 
continuum  of  eddies.  The  apparently  chaotic  fluctuations  of  the  frequency 
distribution of the DNA bases C+G per 10bp in the Human chromosomes 1 to 
24 self-organize to form an ordered hierarchy of spirals or loops.  

Analysis  of  auto-correlations  of  human  chromosomes  1–22  and  rice 
chromosomes 1–12 for seven binary mapping rules shows that the correlation 
patterns  are  different  for  different  rules  but  almost  identical  for  all  of  the 
chromosomes, despite their varying lengths (Podobnik et al., 2007) 

Mansilla  et  al.,  (2004)  calculated  the  mutual  information  function  for 
each  of  the  24  chromosomes  in  the  human  genome.  The  same  correlation 
pattern  is  observed  regardless  the  individual  functional  features  of  each 
chromosome.  Moreover,  correlations  of  different  scale  length  are  detected 
depicting  a  multifractal  scenario.  This  fact  suggest  a  unique  mechanism  of 
structural evolution. 

Quasicrystalline  structure  of  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling  pattern  has 
maximum packing efficiency as displayed in plant phyllotaxis (Selvam, 1998) 
and  may  be  the  geometrical  structure  underlying  the  packing  of  103  to  105 
micrometer  of  DNA  in  a  eukaryotic  (higher  organism)  chromosome  into  a 
metaphase structure (before cell division) a few microns long as explained in 
the following. A length of DNA equal to 2πL when coiled in a loop of radius L 
has a packing efficiency (lengthwise) equal to 2πL/2L=π since the linear length 
2πL  is  now  accommodated  in  a  length  equal  to  the  diameter  2L  of  the  loop. 
Since each stage of looping gives a packing efficiency equal to π, ten stages 
of  such  successive  looping  will  result  in  a  packing  efficiency  equal  to  π10 
approximately equal to 105.  

The  present  study  deals  with  all  the  24  human  chromosome  bases 
C+G  concentration  per  10bp  in  all  available  contiguous  sequences.  The 
window length 10bp was chosen since the primary loop in the DNA molecule 
is  equal  to  about  10bp.  The  power  spectral  analysis  gives  the  dominant 
wavelengths  in  terms  of  this  basic  unit,  namely  the  window  length  of  10bp. 
Increasing  the  window  length  (more  than  10bp)  will  result  in  decrease  in 
resolution  of  shorter  wavelengths.  The  aim  of  this  preliminary  study  is  to 
determine  the  spatial  organization  of  the  DNA  bases  C+G  by  applying 
concepts of a general systems theory first developed for atmospheric flows.  

The  important  results  of  the  present  study  are  as  follows:  (1)  the 
fractal 

concentration  per  10bp  of  DNA  bases  C+G 

follow  selfsimilar 

 

16 

fluctuations,  namely  an  irregular  series  of  successive  increase  followed  by 
decrease  on  all  size  scales.  (2)  The  power  spectra  of  C+G  concentration 
distribution  follow  the  inverse  power  law  form  of  the  statistical  normal 
distribution  signifying  quasicrystalline  structure  of  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose 
tiling  pattern  for  the  spatial  distribution  of  DNA  bases  C+G.  (3)  The 
quasiperiodic Penrose tiling  pattern provides maximum packing efficiency for 
the  DNA  molecule  inside  the  chromosome.  (4)  The  observed  inverse  power 
law  form  for  power  spectra  implies  that  the  DNA  bases  are  arranged  in  a 
fuzzy logic network with inherent long-range correlations. 

6. Conclusions 

Real  world  and  model  dynamical  systems  exhibit  long-range  space-time 
correlations,  i.e.,  coherence,  recently  identified  as  self-organized  criticality. 
Macroscale  coherent  functions  in  biological  systems  develop  from  self-
organization of microscopic scale information flow and control such as in the 
neural  networks  of  the  human  brain  and  in  the  His-Purkinje  fibers  of  human 
heart, which govern vital physiological functions. 

A  recently  developed  cell  dynamical  system  model  for  turbulent  fluid 
flows  predicts  self-organized  criticality  as  intrinsic  to  quantumlike  mechanics 
governing  flow  dynamics.  The  model  concepts  are  independent  of  exact 
details  (physical,  chemical,  biological  etc.)  of  the  dynamical  system  and  are 
universally applicable. The model is based on the simple concept that space-
time integration of microscopic domain fluctuations occur on selfsimilar fractal 
structures  and  give  rise  to  the  observed  space-time  coherent  behaviour 
pattern  with  implicit  long-term  memory.  Selfsimilar  fractal  structures  to  the 
spatial  pattern  for  dynamical  systems  function  as  dynamic  memory  storage 
device with memory recall and update at all time scales. 

The  important  conclusions  of  this  study  are  as  follows:  (1)  the 
frequency  distribution  of  bases  C+G  per  10bp  in  all  the  24  human 
chromosomes  DNA  exhibit  selfsimilar  fractal  fluctuations  which  follow  the 
universal inverse power law form of the statistical normal distribution (Fig. 4), 
a signature of quantumlike chaos. (2) Quantumlike chaos indicates long-range 
spatial  correlations  or  ‘memory’  inherent  to  the  self-organized  fuzzy  logic 
network of the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern (Eq. 1 and Fig. 1). (3) Such 
non-local  connections  indicate  that  coding  exons  together  with  non-coding 
introns contribute to the effective functioning of the DNA molecule as a unified 
whole.  Recent  studies  indicate  that  non-coding  DNA  introduce  modifications 
in  gene  activity  (Cohen,  2002;  Makalowski,  2003).  Studies  now  indicate  that 
non-coding  DNA  may  be  responsible  for  the  signals  that  were  crucial  for 
human  evolution,  directing  the  various  components  of  our  genome  to  work 
differently  from  the  way  they  do  in  other  organisms  (Check,  2006).  (4)  The 
space  filling  quasiperiodic  Penrose  tiling  pattern  provides  maximum  packing 
efficiency for the DNA molecule inside the chromosome.

This  paper  describes  a  design  for  the  front  end  of  a 
superconducting  (SC)  ion  linac  which  can  accept  and 
simultaneously  accelerate  two  charge  states  of  uranium 
from  an  ECR  ion  source.  This  mode  of  operation 
increases the beam current available for the heaviest ions 
by a factor of two.  We discuss the 12 MeV/u prestripper 
section of the Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) driver linac 
including the LEBT, RFQ, MEBT and SC sections, with a 
total voltage of 112 MV.  

fundamental 

The  LEBT  consists  of  two  bunchers  and  electrostatic 
quadrupoles.  The 
frequency  of  both 
bunchers is half of the RFQ frequency. The first buncher 
is a multiharmonic buncher, designed to accept more than 
80%  of  each  charge  state  and  to  form  bunches  of 
extremely  low  longitudinal  emittance  (rms  emittance  is 
lower  than  0.2 5bkeV/ubnsec)  at  the  output  of  the  RFQ. 
The  second  buncher  is  located  directly  in  front  of  the 
RFQ and matches the velocity of each charge-state bunch 
to the design input velocity of the RFQ.  We present full 
3D  simulations  of  a  two-charge-state  uranium  beam 
including  space  charge  forces  in  the  LEBT  and  RFQ, 
realistic  distributions  of  all  electric  and  magnetic  fields 
along  the  whole  prestripper  linac,  and  the  effects  of 
errors,  evaluated  for  several  design  options  for  the 
prestripper linac. The results indicate that it is possible to 
accelerate  two  charge  states  while  keeping  emittance 
growth within tolerable limits. 

1 INTRODUCTION 

accelerator: 

The Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) Facility requires a 
1.3 GeV linac which would accelerate the full mass range 
of ions and would deliver ~400 kW of uranium beam at 
an  energy  of  400  MeV  per  nucleon  [1,2].  The  driver 
would  consist  of  an  ECR  ion  source  and  a  short, 
normally-conducting  RFQ  injector  section  which  would 
feed beams of virtually any ion into the major portion of 
the 
than  400 
superconducting  (SC)  cavities  of  seven  different  types, 
ranging  in  frequency  from  57.5  to  805  MHz.  The  linac 
contains  two  stripping  targets,  at  12  MeV/u  and  85 
MeV/u,  for  the  uranium  beam.  A  novel  feature  of  the 
linac  is  the  acceleration  of  beams  containing  more  than 
one  charge  state  [3,4].  The  front  end  of  the  RIA  driver 
linac consists of a ECR ion source, a LEBT, a 57.5 MHz 
RFQ, a MEBT and a section of SRF drift-tube linac.

The present-day performance of ECR ion sources, and 
considerations based on fundamental limiting processes in 
the  formation  of  high-charge  state  uranium  ions  in  such 

sources, indicate that uranium beam intensities as high as 
7 p2A in a single charge state of 29+ or 30+ are unlikely 
to  be  obtained  in  the  near  future.  Such  a  high  current  is 
required in order to produce the RIA driver linac design 
goal  of  a  400  kW  uranium  beam,  even  if  we  assume 
multiple charge state beam acceleration following the first 
stripper. 

This  paper  discusses  in  detail  a  solution  to  this 
limitation.  It  doubles  the  heavy-ion  beam  intensity  by 
accepting two charge states from the ion source.  

2 DESIGN OF THE FRONT END  

2.1 LEBT  

The LEBT is designed for the selection and separation 
of the required ion species and the acceptance of single- 
or two-charge states by the following RFQ structure. The 
first  portion  of  the  LEBT  is  an  achromatic  bending 
magnet section for charge to mass analysis and selection. 
For the heaviest ions, such as uranium ions, the transport 
system must deliver to the entrance of the first buncher a 
two-charge-state beam with similar Twiss parameters for 
both charge states. The design features of the two-charge 
selector  will  be  discussed  elsewhere.  The  ECR is placed 
on  a  high  voltage  platform.  The  voltage  V0=100  kV  is 
adequate  to  avoid  space  charge  effects  in the LEBT and 
RFQ and to keep the RFQ length to less than 4 m.  

A simplified layout of the second part of the LEBT is 
shown  in  Fig.  1.  This  part  of  the  LEBT  solves  the 
following  tasks:  a)  Beam  bunching  by  a  four-harmonic 
external buncher B1 (the fundamental frequency is 28.75 
MHz);  b)  Velocity  equalization  of  two  different  charge 
states  by  the  buncher  B2,  operating  at  28.75  MHz;  c) 
Charge-insensitive  transverse  focusing  of  the  2-charge 
state  beam  and  matching  to  the  RFQ  acceptance  by  the 
electrostatic quadrupoles Q1-Q8. 

The reference charge state for the design of the LEBT, 
RFQ and MEBT is 29.5. The RFQ injector is designed to 
accelerate  any  beam  from  protons  to  uranium  to  a 
velocity v/c = 0.01893 at the exit of the RFQ.  

The  computer  code  COSY  [5]  was  used  in  order  to 
design  and  optimize  the  LEBT  by  taking  into  account 
terms  through  third  order.  The  final  beam  dynamics 
simulation has been performed by the DYNAMION code 
[6] where the equations of motion are solved in a general 
approximation using realistic 3D electrostatic fields of the 
quadrupoles  and  rf  bunchers,  including  space  charge 
forces  for  the  multi-charged  ion  beams.  Realistic  3D 
fields for the  electrostatic  quadrupoles  were  calculated

the bunches of different charge states q0 and q0-1 by 360G 
at the RFQ frequency. The voltages of the multi-harmonic 
buncher  have  been  optimized,  together  with  the  RFQ 
parameters,  in  order  to  obtain  a  total  efficiency  above 
80%,  while  minimizing  the  longitudinal  emittance  for 
each charge state. The second buncher is used to equalize 
the velocities of the 2 charge states (see Fig. 3c).  

2.2 RFQ 

The formation of heavy-ion beams of low longitudinal 
emittance  has  been  discussed  in  ref.  [8],  in  which  the 
lowest beam emittance was obtained by prebunching and 
using a drift space inside the RFQ. This procedure works 
well  for  a  single  charge  state  beam,  but  cannot 
accommodate  two  charge  states  because  of  the  different 
velocities of different charge states coming from the same 
ion source.  

injector  system  which  can  provide  very 

We describe below a new design for a low current RFQ 
and 
low 
longitudinal  emittance  for  operation  with  both  single 
charge  state  and  two-charge  state  beams.  Low  rms  and 
total  longitudinal  emittance  are  achieved  by  using  an 
external multi-harmonic buncher and an RFQ of modified 
design. The RFQ has three main sections: 1) the standard 
radial  matcher,  2)  the  transition  section  and  3)  the 
acceleration section.  

]The radial matcher transforms the RFQ acceptance to a 
set  of  Twiss  parameters  that  avoids  large  beam  sizes  in 
the LEBT quadrupoles. 

The transition section is a part of the RFQ with a linear 
variation of the synchronous phase. The RFQ parameters 
A, m, a and S are calculated self-consistently in order to 
filter the longitudinal emittance in such a way that the low 
populated area will be lost either inside the RFQ or in the 
MEBT.  It  is  performed  by  an  iterative  procedure  of  the 
whole  RFQ  design  and  by  observing  the  emittance 
formation  in  the  longitudinal  phase  space.  The  desired 
result  is  achieved  if  the  separatrix  size  is  slightly  larger 
than  the  densely  populated  area  of  beam  emittance.  The 
design goal is an rms emittance below 0.2 5bkeV/ubnsec, 
required  for  multiple  charge  state  operation  through  the 
rest of the linac. 

The  acceleration  section  is  a  portion  of  the  RFQ  with 
constant synchronous phase which is equal to –24°.  The 
RFQ forms a beam crossover at the exit in both transverse 
planes. This results in better matching of the two-charge 
state beam in the MEBT.  

In this way, the RFQ was designed for acceleration of 
one-  or  two-charge  state  heavy-ion  beams  from  12.4 
keV/u to 167 keV/u over a length of 4 m. The phase space 
plots  from  numerical  simulations  of  a  two-charge  state 
uranium beam exiting the RFQ are shown in Fig. 4.  

2.3 Beam simulation in the MEBT and SRF 
linac  

Between  the  RFQ  and  SRF  Linac  there  is  a  matching 
section – the MEBT. We found that SC solenoids placed 
in individual cryostats are the best option to focus a two-

by the SIMION code [7]. The 3D field distributions have 
been used with both the COSY and DYNAMION codes. 
Figure  2  shows  beam  envelopes  along 
the  LEBT 
optimized  by  COSY.  The  total  normalized  emittance  at 
the  exit  assumes  an 
ion  source  emittance  of  0.5 
5bmmbmrad.  After  careful  optimization,  including  third 
order terms, the rms emittance growth is less than 7% in 
the  horizontal  plane.  In  the  vertical  plane  there  is  no 
observable  rms  emittance  growth.  Figure  3  shows  the 
transformation  of  the  beam  image  in  longitudinal  phase 
space.  The  first  multi-harmonic  buncher  modulates  the 
beam  velocity  of  the  two  charge  states  as  shown  in  Fig. 
3a. The drift space between the two bunchers (see Fig. 3) 
is chosen from the expression

The  portion  of  the  linac  prior  to  the  first  stripper 
contains  96  cavities  of  four  different  types.  Prior  to  ray 
tracing  a  multiple  charge  state  beam 
the 
transverse  beam  motion  was 
prestripper 
matched  carefully  using  fitting  codes  for a trial beam of 
charge  state  q=29.5.  A  particularly  critical  aspect  of 
fitting  was  to  avoid  beam  mismatch  at  the  transitions 
between  focusing  periods  of  differing  lengths.  The 
focusing  lattice  length  is  different  for  each  of  the  four 
types  of  SRF  cavities.  The  phase  advance  per  focusing 
period was set at 60°. As mentioned in ref. [3], the correct 
choice of phase advance is crucial for effective steering of 
the multiple charge state beam. The design and simulation 
of 3D beam dynamics in the SRF linac was performed by 
the LANA code [9]. The pre-processor code generates the 
phase  setting  for  a  uranium  beam  with  average  charge 
state q=29.5. The rf phase is set  to –30° with respect to 
the  maximum  energy  gain  in  each  SRF  cavity.  Realistic 

field  distributions  for  the  SRF  cavities  were  generated 
using  an  axially-symmetric  approximation  of  the  actual 
drift  tube  cavities.  These  fields  are  used  both  for  the 
design procedure and for the beam dynamics simulation. 
The initial phase space distribution used for each charge 
state  was  the  beam  at  the  exit  of  the  RFQ,  as  simulated 
with  the  DYNAMION  code.  The  particle  coordinates 
were then tracked through the SRF linac. Figure 5 shows 
the  transverse  beam  envelopes  (rms  and  total)  along  the 
MEBT and SRF linac. Despite  the slight mismatch of the 
two-charge  state  beam  along  the  linac,  there  is  no  rms 
emittance growth in the transverse plane for an ideal linac 
without any errors.  

In  longitudinal  phase  space  the  emittance  of  the  two 
charge state beam is always larger than for a single charge 
state  beam.  Growth  in  effective  emittance  occurs  due  to 
the  oscillations  caused  by  the  slightly  different,  off-tune 
synchronous  phases  for  charge  states  29+  and  30+. 
However,  the  very  low  longitudinal  emittance  achieved 
by the RFQ injector ensures that the total emittance of the 
two-charge state beam remains well inside the stable area 
in  longitudinal  phase  space. 
  Figure  6  shows  the 
longitudinal  phase  space  just  prior  to  the  first  stripper. 
Note  that  the  energy  and  phase  acceptance  of  the 
linac  are  H3%  and  H30G, 
reminder  of 
respectively.

3 CONCLUSION 

The  problem  of  acceptance  and  acceleration  of  two 
charge states of a heavy-ion beam from a single ECR ion 
source  was  successfully  solved.  A  front  end  has  been 
designed for a driver linac for RIA that accelerates a two-
charge state uranium beam. The use of a two-charge state 
beam  is  a  powerful  tool  to  double  the  total  beam  power 
produced by the heavy ion driver linac.

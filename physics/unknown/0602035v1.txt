THE DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION

OF A GALAXY: PRELIMINARIES

According to the (3rd) cosmological model of a doubly rotating Universe of the

author (describing rotation and acceleration at the same time), Coriolis forces

are   developed   acting   on   the   infalling   material   of   any   collapsing   density

perturbation, serving as the cause for the development of density waves, which in

turn give rise to the observed spiral structure of galaxies. If we ignore at a first

stage this motion of the galactic material, and consider this galactic material as

taking   part   only   in   the   overall   rotation   of   the   Universe,   we   can   arrive   at   a

preliminary differential rotation, caused merely by the form of the underlying

metric. This (angular) differential rotation ω is proportional to 1/r, where r is the

distance   from   the   galactic   center,   depending   also   on   sinθ,   where  θ  is   the

azimuthal angle around the center of the galaxy.

The metric of the rotating and accelerating Universe in comoving (but not inertial)

coordinates is [1]

where U, ω1, and ω2 are constants. This can be written in inertial (but not comoving)

coordinates [1] as

In these latter coordinates, the cosmic material rotates around the z-axis (see fig. 3 of

[1]) with angular velocity dφ/dt = ω1, and if dΦ/dt = ω2, it also accelerates away from

the z-axis on any z = const. plane with acceleration dV/(cdt) = ω2/cos2Φ at the same

time.

Ignoring the acceleration at a first stage, i.e. taking dΦ = 0 in (2), we have for the

spatial metric from (2) that

We observe at once that (3) would be the Euclidean metric on a plane in cylindrical

coordinates, if it was of the form

2.                                                                                                     (4)

The absence of r2 in (3) is right what causes the differential rotation! This is the case

because from (3) results that a material point rotating around the z-axis will move

with the same linear tangential velocity v0 = ω1 independently of how far from the z-

axis it is.

Now consider a galaxy with its disk on some z = const. plane (for simplicity). Let

its center be at O, and a material point be at A (see fig.1).Let the direction towards the

z-axis (the axis of rotation) be OB, and the galaxy be sufficiently far from this axis.

Let OA be seen from the axis at an angle  Ω0  = v0/R0  <<1 (since R0  is very large),

where R0 is the distance of the galaxy from the center of rotation (the z-axis). Then of

course CA, pointing towards the center of rotation, will be || OB and thus OBAC will

be a rectangular (see fig.1). Suppose also that OA = r, and that the azimuthal angle of

A with respect to O, and from OB, is θ.

Due to the overall rotation of the Universe with “angular” velocity  ω1  = v0, the

change of the direction of v0 from B to A (see fig.1), will give rise to the appearance

of a velocity difference v, which is the velocity of A relative to O, given (see fig.1) by

Then the tangential velocity of A around O will be given (see fig.1) by

to the first order in Ω0. The final result is for the angular velocity ω of A around O:

where v0 is a universal constant, and Ω0 is another constant characteristic of the galaxy

on hand, namely Ω0 = v0/R0.

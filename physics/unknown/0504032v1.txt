In this letter we specify the physical parameters necessary to operate a SASE FEL in the 

quantum regime with a laser wiggler. We also show  that this is more feasible in the quantum 

regime than in the classical one. Specific examples are given. 

PACS: 41.60.Cr; 42.50.Fx. 

Key words: quantum SASE; FEL; experimental parameters.

It has been previously recognized that quantum effects in SASE FEL are determined by the 

quantum FEL parameter  ρ  [1] defined as the usual FEL parameter times the ratio between the 

electron energy and the photon energy. Quantum effects become relevant when  ρ  < 1. However 

the calculations of Ref. [1] are confined to the linear regime. In Ref. [2] we have extended the 

theory of Quantum SASE FEL to the non linear regime and we have shown the phenomenon of 

quantum purification of SASE spectrum, i.e., the broad superposition of chaotic series of random 

spikes predicted by the classical theory shrinks to a very narrow spectrum of the emitted radiation 

when  ρ <1. The question is: what is the experimental set up and the experimental parameters 

necessary to observe Quantum SASE in the short wavelength region (where quantum effects are 

expected and more relevant)?  

The first possibility is the usual configuration of  GeV accelerators and very long magnetic 

undulators as in the SLAC LCLS and DESY TESLA-FEL projects. However the quantum regime 

would require even longer magnetic undulator, because to reach the quantum regime one needs a 

very low value of the FEL parameter, which determines the gain per wiggler period.  

Alternatively one can propose the use of a typical Compton back scattered configuration: a low 

energy electron beam counter-propagating with respect to an electromagnetic wiggler (wave) 

provided by a high power laser. In this note we propose the Compton configuration giving the 

scaling laws and the expressions of all relevant physical quantities as a function of  ρ, both in the 

quantum and the classical case. In particular, we show that this experimental set up appears 

reasonable in the quantum SASE regime  ρ<< 1, whereas it is much more problematic in the 

classical regime, due to fact that the scaling laws as a function of  ρ are much different in the two 

cases.

Let us consider a laser wiggler with radiation propagating in the z direction opposite to an electron 

beam with the following specifications: W0 is the minimum diameter of the laser beam in the focus, 

σ0 is the minimum radius of the electron beam , Z0 is the distance in which the radiation beam 

diverges (Rayleigh range), β* is the analogous length for the electron beam , γ is the Lorentz factor, 

εn is the normalized beam emittance and λr is the FEL radiation wavelength length. The following 

relations are well known [3]:

In order to ensure a good overlap and matching between radiation and electron beam we must 

Condition (3) is rather conservative [4], but ensures that the laser intensity is almost constant over 

the electron beam transverse profile. If the wiggler parameter is small condition (3) can be relaxed. 

The FEL resonance condition for an electromagnetic wiggler reads:

We remark that for a magnetic wiggler the factor 1/2 should be replaced by 1/

We remark that Eq. (6) (formally independent on the electron energy) gives a direct relation 

between the radiation wavelength and the wiggler wavelength in terms of two geometrical 

parameters and  εn  (via the η factor) and the wiggler parameter. The previous relations can be 

derived using the following chain of equations:

Eliminating Z0 from the first and the last equation, we obtain Eqs. (6) and (7). As an example if we 

take, ε1=ε2= εn=1, λr=1A, and aw <<1, we obtain λ=1 µm.  

Using Eq. (5), Eq. (6) can be written as

Equation (8) fix the resonant energy only in terms of the parameter η and of the laser wiggler 

wavelength. For example for η =1 and λ = 1 µ one has γ = 50.

Equation (11) is not an exact equation, but is an interpolation formula which gives the correct 

behaviour in the quantum regime  ρ <<1 [2] and the classical expression [5] in the opposite limit. 

This equation can be rigorously justified in the asymptotic cases  ρ very large or very small.  

We must also impose that the electron beam characteristic length β* is larger than the gain length, 

i.e.,

The units are: λ in µm, P(TW), λr in Angstrom. The other characteristic lengths β* , Z0, and W0 can 

be obtained by Eqs. (1-4) and (27).  

Two explicit examples for a laser wiggler at 1 µm and 10 µm are given in Table 1, where all the 

other physical parameters are expressed as a function of the laser power, P. The values in 

parenthesis are for P=1TW.  

In conclusion, Eqs. (17)-(27) and relations (1)-(4) give the relevant quantities for the design of a 

SASE FEL in terms of the quantum FEL parameter ρ, the pump laser wavelength λ, the 

unperturbed wiggler parameter a0, and of adimensional parameters η (Eq. (7)). The quantum SASE 

regime is obtained when  ρ< 1 whereas in the opposite limit the classical regime with a laser 

wiggler is recovered. We remark again that Eq. (21) shows that in the classical limit, where  ρ>>1, 

the required current increases as  ρ and is much larger than in the quantum regime, where it is 

independent of  ρ. This fact makes more problematic the use of an electromagnetic wiggler in the 

 

7

classical regime than in the quantum regime. If the quantum regime with the laser wiggler  is 

experimentally feasible, a short wavelength coherent FEL can be a table top object. In such a case 

the technological problem would go from high energy accelerators plus long magnetic wigglers to 

the widely used high power laser technology.

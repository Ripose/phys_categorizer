Abstract:    In  this  paper  we  evaluate  the  cut-off  properties  of  holey  fibers 
(HFs)  with  a  triangular  lattice  of  air  holes  and  the  core  formed  by  the 
removal of a single (HF1) or more air holes (HF3 and HF7). With the aid of 
finite-element  simulations  we  determine  the  single-mode  and  multi-mode 
phases  and  also  find  the  air  hole  diameters  limiting  the  endlessly  single-
mode  regime.  From  calculations  of  V  and  W  parameters  we  find  that  in 
general HF1 is less susceptible to longitudinal non-uniformities compared to 
the other designs for equivalent effective areas. As an example we illustrate 
this  general  property  for  the  particular  case  of  a  macro-bending  induced 
loss.

1. Introduction 

Large-mode-area (LMA) single-mode fibers are essential to many applications including high 
power  delivery,  fiber  amplification,  and  low  non-linear  data  transmission.  While  standard 
optical fibers have difficulties in providing both large mode area and single-mode operation, 
all-silica photonic crystal fibers [1], also referred to as holey fibers (HFs), are highly potential 
candidates for realizing LMA single-mode fibers. This owes mainly to their endlessly single-
mode  properties  [2]  which  allows  for  very  broad-band  single  mode  LMA  HFs  [3]-[5]  and 
even  broad-band  polarization  maintaining  and  single-polarizing  LMA  HFs  have  been 
achieved with the addition of stress-applying parts [6], [7]. 

Typically, HFs are formed by a single missing air hole (HF1) in the otherwise periodic 
triangular lattice (with pitch Λ) of air holes (with diameter d), but HFs with three (HF3) [8] 
and  seven  (HF7) [9]  missing  neighboring  air  holes have  also  been  reported,  see  Table 1.  In 
Ref. [8] the HF3 design was suggested to be less susceptible to longitudinal non-uniformities 
(including macro-bending induced loss) compared to the HF1 for equivalent effective areas. 
The  comparison relied heavily  on  the  ability  to predict  the  respective  values of  d*/Λ  for  the 
endlessly  single-mode  regime.  Unfortunately,  super-cell  methods,  as  employed  in  Ref.  [8], 
have  later proved  inadequate  for  such quantitative  predictions  (for  HF3 a  value of 0.25 was 
estimated)  as  is  evident  by  comparing  the  phase  diagram  for  HF1  first  suggested  by 
Mortensen [10] to the subsequent results obtained by Kuhlmey et al. with the aid of a multi-
pole  method [11]. In  this  work we  employ  a  finite-element  approach which,  combined  with 
perfectly-matched layers, also provides quantitative correct results for the cut-off properties. 

Our results for HF3 differ significantly from the initial results presented in Ref. [8] and in 
general  we  find  that  the  HF1  is  indeed  superior  to  the  HF3  and  HF7  in  terms  of  the 
susceptibility to longitudinal non-uniformities for equivalent effective areas. We illustrate this 
general property by means of calculations of the V and W parameters and we also illustrate it 
for the particular case of a macro-bending induced loss mechanism.

2. Endlessly single-mode structure and the V parameter 

Following  the  ideas  in  Ref.  [10]  we  map  the  cut-off  properties  in  a  λc/Λ  versus  d/Λ  phase-
diagram for the three HFs in Table 1. For the simulations we have employed a finite-element 
method  (FEM)  with  perfectly-matched  layers  [12].  In  Fig.  1  we  summarize  the  results 
obtained by the FEM analysis (the open data points) for the three classes of HFs. The cutoff 
wavelength of the second order mode is defined to be the wavelength at which the effective 
index  of  the  second  order  mode  becomes  equal  to  the  effective  cladding  index,  i.e.  the 
effective  index  of  fundamental  space-filling  mode,  nFSM.  The  accurate  value  of  nFSM  can  be 
determined by applying the full-vector FEM to the so-called elementary piece in the cladding 
region, which acts as a boundary-less propagation medium [13], [14]. A reduced value of d/Λ 
is needed to keep the holey fiber with the inclusion of more than a single solid rod endlessly 
single  mode.  For  the  single  rod  case  the  limit  is  d*/Λ=0.424.  This  value  is  in  excellent 
agreement with the result of multipole method [15]. For the other holey fiber cores formed by 
three and seven neighboring rods, we found, respectively, d*/Λ=0.165 and d*/Λ=0.046 as the 
upper limits for endlessly single-mode operation.

Fig. 2.  Impact of the number of air-hole rings on the value of ∆n=neff(2nd mode)−nFSM, where 
neff(2nd mode) is the effective index of the second order mode. 

In  order  to  justify  the  upper  limit  of  the  endlessly  single-mode  operation  of  the  three 
types of HFs introduced in Table 1, in Fig. 2 we show the impact of the number of air-hole 
rings on the value of ∆n=neff(2nd mode)−nFSM, where neff(2nd mode) is the effective index of 
the second order mode. Keeping in mind that the definition of the cutoff wavelength is related 
to  the  value  of  ∆n=0,  which  is  equivalent  to  the  W  parameter  being  equal  to  zero  (as  the 
number  of  air-hole  rings  tend  to  infinity),  we  plot  ∆n  for  various  values  of  the  normalized 
quantity d/Λ, for fixed operating wavelength of λ/Λ=0.01. From the results in Fig. 2, we can 
clearly identify the appropriate limiting value of d*/Λ, below which we have endlessly single-
mode  operation.  Specifically,  in  Fig.  2(a),  we  see  that,  for  HF1,  this  limiting  value  is 
d*/Λ(HF1)=0.424,  while 
from  Fig.  2(c), 
d*/Λ(HF7)=0.046. 

from  Fig.  2(b),  d*/Λ(HF3)=0.165,  and 

From these results, we can define the V parameter (the normalized frequency) and the W 
parameter (the normalized transverse attenuation constant) for each holey fiber. Two slightly 
different  definitions  of  V  parameters  have  been  suggested  recently,  see  Refs.  [16],  [17]  and 
Refs. [18]-[20]. Here, we use the latter V and W parameter definitions

We emphasized that this particular choice does not influence our overall conclusions. In these 
expressions,  k=2π/λ  is  the  free-space  wave  number,  aeff  is  the  effective  core  radius, 
nco=nsilica=1.45  is  the  core  index,  neff(λ)  is  the  effective  index of  the fundamental  mode,  and 
nFSM(λ) is the effective cladding index corresponding to the fundamental space-filling mode. 
In Ref. [18] it was found that by adjusting aeff to 
 for the HF1 the cut-off results in Fig. 
1 are extremely well-described by V(λc)=2.405 as for standard step-index fibers. For the other 
classes of HFs we likewise find that the values of aeff listed in Table 1 account well for the 
numerical FEM results in Fig. 1 as shown by the nice accounts for the FEM data points by the 
solid curves obtained from Eq. (1).

The susceptibility to longitudinal non-uniformities may be quantified by the coupling length zc 
between  the  fundamental  mode  and  the  fundamental  space-filling  mode  [21]  and  using 
.  Thus,  when  W  is  increased  the  HF  is  less 
n
eff
susceptible to longitudinal non-uniformities. Similar arguments apply for the leakage loss due 
to an air-hole cladding of finite extension [20]. The V parameter reflects the same properties 
and  in  Fig.  3  we  show  the  V  and  W  values  for  endlessly  single  mode  holey  fibers  (with 
*/Λ,  see  Table  1)  as  a  function  of  Aeff/λ2,  where  Aeff  is  the  effective  mode  area.  From 
d/Λ=d
these curves we conclude that the HF1 is the one being less susceptible to longitudinal non-
uniformities  and  the  susceptibility  in  general  increases  for  cores  formed  by  an  increasing 
number of removed air holes. 

Next,  in  order  to  further  support  the  above  obtained  general  results,  we  consider  the 
calculation  of  the  macro-bending  induced  loss  for  the  endlessly  single-mode  HF1  and  HF3 
with equivalent effective area of Aeff = 200 µm2 at λ = 1.55 µm. The structural parameters are 
Λ = 12.4 µm and d/Λ = 0.424 for HF1 and Λ = 7.0 µm and d/Λ = 0.165 for HF3, respectively. 
We  also  show  the  macro-bending  loss  for  LMA  HF3  with  d/Λ  =  0.25  [8],  but  still  with 
equivalent  effective  area  of  200  µm2  corresponding  to  a  pitch  Λ  =  7.85  µm.  We  emphasize 
that  the  latter  HF3  is  not  an  endlessly  single-mode  fiber  since  d/Λ = 0.25 > 0.165.  For 
calculation  of  the  macro-bending  induced  loss  we  employ  the  tilted  index  model  employed

recently  in  Ref.  [22].  The  tilted  index  model  is  an  exact  mapping  for  a  scalar  description 
which  is  expected  to  work  well  for  the  LMA  HFs  with  λ  <<  Λ,  see  e.g.  Refs.  [23],  [24]. 
Figure 4 shows the macro-bending loss property of HF1 and HF3 calculated through FEM. As 
clearly  seen,  HF1  has  lower  bending  loss  compared  to  the  endlessly  single-mode  HF3  with 
d/Λ  =  0.165,  while  HF3  with  d/Λ  =  0.25  has  lower  bending  loss  compared  to  HF1.  The 
oscillatory characteristics of the HF1 bending loss originates from the coupling between the 
fundamental core mode and weakly localized cladding modes [25]. For HF3 the cladding has 
a  significantly  reduced  air-hole  diameter  (compared  to  HF1)  which  does  not  support  such 
weakly  localized  cladding  modes. As  a  consequence we observe  no oscillatory  behavior  for 
the endlessly single-mode HF3. 

 

4. Conclusions 

In  conclusion  we  have  investigated  the  cut-off  properties  of  holey  fibers  for  different  core 
designs and we have accurately determined the single-mode and multi-mode phases as well as 
the  air  hole  diameters  limiting  the  endlessly  single-mode  regime.  By  comparing  V  and  W 
parameters  for  the  different  core  designs  at  the  theoretical  endlessly  single-mode  limit  we 
conclude that in general HF1 is less susceptible to longitudinal non-uniformities compared to 
the other designs for equivalent effective areas. This conclusion relies heavily on the correct 
identification of the air-hole diameters limiting endlessly single-mode operation. In practice it 
is however well accepted that single-mode operation can be extended to somewhat higher air-
hole diameters  due  to  the  high-loss nature of high-order  modes.  The  practical  limit  depends 
quite a lot on the longitudinal quality of the fiber and the bending radius, but in e.g. Ref. [8] 
broad-band  single-mode  operation  was  experimentally  observed  with  normalized  air-hole 
diameters of 0.45 and 0.25 for HF1 and HF3, respectively.

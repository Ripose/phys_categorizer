Abstract. 
The Doppler Effect is associated with physical quantities such as period, frequency, and 
wavelength. It involves a periodic phenomenon taking place at a given point in space and 
an  agent  which  carries  information  about  it  in  space.  The  device  which  creates  the 
periodic  phenomenon  represents  a  source.  The  effect  is  observed  from  an  inertial 
reference frame K(XOY) relative to which source S and receiver R move with speeds vs 
and vR, respectively, whereas the information propagates with speed U. In order to keep 
the problem as simple as possible, we will consider the source as being at rest. 
Moreau introduces the concept of non-locality in the period measurement by an observer, 
associated with the fact that a period measurement by a moving observer (accelerating 
or not) “requires the detection of (at least) two  space-time events separated by a finite 
time interval, corresponding to the passage of successive wave-crests by the observer’s 
detector”  [1].  We  can  say  that  the  moving  observer  R  receives  two  successive  wave-
crests at two different points in space, at two different times. The time interval between 
the  emissions  of  two  successive  wave-crests  by  the  source,  measured  in  its  rest  frame 
represents the period of emission, whereas the time interval between the receptions of the 
same two wave-crests by the receiver, measured in its rest frame represents the reception 
period. The problem is to find a relationship between the two periods defined above. It is 
clear that, in the general case, the speed of the receiver and the angle at which it receives 
the successive wave-crests could change. The important conclusion is that a continuous 
recording of the period of reception is not possible. 
In many cases the non-locality is not taken into account. We present two cases in which a 
continuous change in the receiver’s speed and in the angle at which the successive wave-
crests  are  received  takes  place.  In  each  case  the  error  committed  by  not  taking  into 
account the non-locality is evaluated.  
 

1. Introduction 

 
When  speaking  of  a  physical  quantity  it  is  advisable  to  specify  who  is  performing  the 
measurements, when and where the measurements are performed, the measuring devices 
used and the time taken to perform the measurements. 
A  Doppler  effect  experiment  involves,  in  its  simplest  form,  a  stationary  source  of 
periodic oscillations S located at the origin O of the K(XOY) reference frame, the 
 rest  frame  of  the  medium  through  which  information  about  the  oscillations  propagates 
with constant velocity U. It also involves a receiver R moving with constant  velocity v 
along an arbitrary direction (Figure 1). We have to compare the constant period TS (the 
-1)  at  which  the  source  emits  successive  crests  and  the  time 
constant  frequency  fS=TS
interval TR (the frequency fR=TR

-1) during which they are received by R.

Moreau [1] introduces the concept of non-locality in the frequency (period) measurement 
by a moving observer. It is associated with the fact that a moving observer is not able to 
receive two successive crests at the same point in space.  
 Many derivations of the Doppler shift formulas, frequently used in the current practice,  
 are  based  on  simplifying  assumptions  (plane  wave  approximation  or  very  small  period 
approximation)  which  favor  locality  in  the  period  measurement  by  a  moving  observer 
[2],[3],[4]. Such derivations go as follows. Consider that when clock C0( 0,0) located at O 
reads tS a signal propagating with constant velocity U is emitted. The signal is received 
by R at a position R(θ,r) when a clock C(θ,r) located there reads tR. 
It is obvious that 

Differentiating both sides of Equation (1) we obtain

Equation (1) holds for any value of tS, even for tS=0.

by taking into account that  
dr
dtR
represents  the  radial  component  of  the  instantaneous  velocity  of  R  and  θ  the 
instantaneous angle made between v and U (Figure 1) 
If  we  think  of  dtS  and  dtR  as  of  the  “very  small”  periods  at  which  the  wave  crests  are 
emitted  and  received  respectively,  then  Equation  (3)  describes  the  Doppler  shift  with 
stationary source and arbitrarily moving receiver with the locality assumption. 
Many  authors  present  it  as  a  relationship  between  finite  periods  of  emission  and 
reception,  without  mentioning  that  it  holds  true  only  if  the  locality  conditions  are  met 
[2],[3],[4]. 
Equation (4) shows that the measurement of the instantaneous velocity requires the same 
time interval dtR as the measurement of the reception time interval. 
Following  a  derivation  proposed  by  Donges  [2]  we  consider  that  the  phase  of  the 
oscillations at the source is 
ψR =ωSt  
whereas at the location of observer R it is

instantaneous frequency [5], we obtain

Equation  (7)  is  frequently  used  even  when  it  is  considered  that  the  instantaneous 
frequency is not a measurable physical quantity [5]. 
We could reduce the Doppler effect to its essence, replacing the crests by pellets fired by 
a machine gun at a constant period TS, which hit a moving target at the time intervals TR 
[6].It is clear that in this case the concept of instantaneous frequency and the derivations 
presented above are meaningless. Given this scenario, we have to find the time interval 
between the incidences of two successive bullets TR (fR) and to relate it to TS (fS). If TS is 
measured as a difference between the readings of the same clock Co(0,0) located in front 
of the source, TR is measured as a difference between the readings of two clocks located 
where  the  bullets  hit  the  target.  If  the  velocity  of  R  is  not  constant  or  if  between  the 
receptions of two successive crests the angle θ changes, then the relationship between TS 
and TR becomes a function of time. 
The purpose of our paper is to derive exact formulas for the acoustic Doppler shift taking 
into  account  the  non-locality  and  presenting  the  error  introduced  by  not  taking  it  into 
account. 
 

2.  Longitudinal  acoustic  Doppler  Effect  with  stationary  source  and  uniformly 

accelerating receiver. 
 
Consider that at t=0 (reading of clock Co(0,0) ), observer R is at rest and located at the 
origin O of the K(XOY) reference frame, where the source S(0,0) is located at rest. The 
observer starts to move at that very moment with constant acceleration g in the positive 
direction of the OX axis. At time tR, R is located at a distance 
 

x =

With the locality assumption we consider that at time t the instantaneous velocity of R is 
 
v = gtR   
 
Replacing that value in Equation (7) we obtain

In  the  non-locality  assumption,  we  consider  that  the  stationary  source  emits  successive 
wave-crests  at  a  constant  period  TS,  labeled  0,1,2…n  and  emitted  at  t=0,  t1=TS, 
t2=2TS…,tn=nTS. The motion of the crest labeled n is described by 
 
(
x = U t − nTS
 
From Equations (8) and (11) we obtain that the n-th crest is received by R at time

When  the  speed  of  R  equals  the  propagation  speed  of  the  information  U,  the  observer 
loses contact with the source. This event takes place at time

and its variation with n for a given value of N is represented in Figure 2. 
As we see, the error is an increasing function of n, due to the fact that the velocity of R 
increases with n, which favors the non-locality.  
 

3. Stationary source and uniformly moving observer, receiving the wave-crests at 

an oblique angle of incidence. 
 
The scenario is presented in Figure 3. The stationary source S is located at the origin O of 
the K(XOY) reference frame. Observer R moves with constant velocity v parallel to the 
OX axis at a distance d from it. In the non-locality approach we consider that during the 
reception of two successive wave-crests the angle θ at which the wave-crests are received 
changes. A change in the radial component of the velocity of R also takes place and we 
will take into account these essential features. 
In the non-locality approach we consider that a wave-crest emitted at t=0 is received by R 
at a position R1(r1,θ1) at time tR,1 . A second wave-crest emitted at TS is received by R at a 
position R2(r2, θ2) at time tR,2. We have 
 

TR =

(
r2 − r1

)+ TS 

 

 

 

 

 

(21)

where  TS  represents  the  constant  period  at  which  the  wave-crests  are  emitted  by  the 
source, whereas TR represents the time interval during which they are received by R at 
two different points in space. During the time interval TR, R covers a distance vTR. As we 
see 
 
2 = r2
r1
 
Eliminating r1 by combining Equations (21) and (22) and using the simplifying notations 
r1=r and θ2=θ we obtain

Where λ=UTS represents the wavelength in the rest frame of the source. As we see, Dm 
depends on the dimensionless parameter m=d/λ, d representing the distance between the 
line along which R moves and the OX axis. The locality assumption (very small period, 
very  large  source-receiver  distance)  is  associated  with  very  large  values  of  m.  As 
expected  
 
limDm = D   
 
where in accordance with Equation (7) D represents the Doppler factor corresponding to 
the locality assumption. The error made by not taking into account the non-locality can 
be define as

The  parameter  m=r/λ  can  change  over  a  very  large  range.  The  ratio  of  v  to  U  can  also 
change over a large range, v/U<1 corresponding to the subsonic case, v/U=1 to the sonic 
case, whereas v/U>1 corresponds to the supersonic case.  
In order to illustrate the results obtained above we represent in Figure 4 the variation of 
the non-local Doppler factor D with the angle θ for a constant value of v/U but different 
values of the parameter m in the subsonic, sonic and supersonic cases. The case v/U<1 
correctly reflects the case when the source emits light signals, 
The only thing that has to be done is to replace U with c and to impose the condition v<c. 
In the subsonic case, the variation of the error ε% introduced by not taking into account 
the non-locality with the angle θ is represented in Figure 5. As we can see, the error is a 
decreasing  function  of  m,  reaching  a  maximum  in  the  range  of  the  transversal  Doppler 
Effect (θ=900). 
For  0<θ<900  observer  R  is  “outgoing”  whereas  for  900<θ<1800  observer  R  is 
“incoming”. 
 

4. Conclusions 

 
We have shown that the derivation of the Doppler shift formulas is associated with the 
concept  of  locality  (the  moving  observer  is  able  to  receive  two  successive  crests  while 
remaining  located  at  the  same  point  in  space)  or  with  the  concept  of  non-locality  (the 
moving  observer  receives  two  successive  crests  at  two  different  points  in  space).  The 

 

6

locality  approach  leads  to  the  concept  of  simultaneous  frequency  defined  as  the  time 
derivative  of  the  phase.  The  formulas  obtained  in  this  case  are  so  frequently  used  that 
authors  fail  to  remind  the  reader  that  they  are  the  result  of  the  “plane  wave 
approximation” or of the “very small period approximation.” The non-locality approach 
is based on the time interval between the receptions of two successive crests, the inverse 
of which is defined as the reception frequency. 
The use of the instantaneous frequency in cases in which the locality conditions are not 
met  leads  to  significant  errors,  especially  considering  the  high  degree  of  accuracy  with 
which time intervals are measured nowadays.

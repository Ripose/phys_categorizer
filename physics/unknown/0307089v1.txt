Abstract. It is known that the combined action of convection and pitch-angle diffu-
sion is responsible for the formation of gas pressure distribution in the magnetosphere 
[3]. Plasma pressure, in turn, determines - within the framework of a given magnetic 
field model - the density of bulk currents in the magnetosphere. With a knowledge of 
the bulk currents as a function of coordinates, we can calculate the field-aligned cur-
rents as a divergence of bulk currents. On the other hand, specifying the convection 
model is equivalent to specifying the electric field model. Since within the approxi-
mation of equipotential field lines the electric field is common to the magnetosphere 
and  ionosphere,  bulk  currents  and  field-aligned  currents  in  the  ionosphere  can  be 
formally  calculated  subject  to  the  condition  that  ionospheric  conductivity  is  wholly 
determined  by  electron  precipitation  from  the  magnetosphere.  The  precipitation  in-
tensity  is  readily  inferred  from  the  same  magnetospheric  model.  Thus  we  have  two 
systems of field-aligned currents. One system is calculated from the model of plasma 
pressure  distribution  in  the  magnetosphere,  and  the  other  is  inferred  from  a  given 
model of the electric field and the electroconductivity model calculated from electron 
precipitation.  This  brings  up  the  question:  How  can  these  two  systems  of  field-
aligned currents be reconciled? From previous studies [4,5] it is known that magneto-
spheric  convection  “adjusts  itself”  to  the  level  of  energy  losses  in  the  ionosphere. 
Based on this, an attempt can be made to achieve a conjugation of the aforementioned 
two systems of field-aligned currents. This paper is devoted to analyzing such an at-
tempt. 
 
Introduction 
 
     Over  30  years  ago,  C.F.Kennel  suggested  the  idea  [2]  that  the  pitch-angle  diffu-
sion  of  particles  into  the  loss  cone,  together  with  adiabatic  compression  of  plasma 
during the convection into the magnetosphere determines the behavior of the contents 
of the magnetic flux tube, the plasma tube. Gas pressure builds up under the action of 
an  adiabatic  compression  of  plasma  drifting  in  a  magnetic  field  with  increasing 
strength and precipitation-induced losses. A combined effect of these factors leads to 
an expression for gas pressure in the form [3]:

 In  this  case  the  magnetosphere  develops  a  plasma  pressure  distribution,  such  as 
shown in Fig. 1.

time in the model from [3]. 

 
In these calculations, boundary conditions are time-independent, that is, the supply of 
plasma  through  the  boundary  remains  uniform,  and  only  the  convection  velocity 
changes. It is seen how the pressure peak increases with the increasing electric field 
and how it reverts to the original level. Noteworthy is the relatively gentle backward 
slope of the relief and a very steep forward slope. If the boundary conditions are un-
steady and pressure increases for a certain time on the boundary of the region, from 
which plasma starts, the resulting plasma “bunch” drifts downstream of the convec-
tion.  Since  the  resulting  pressure  amplitude  is  the  product  of  the  undisturbed  signal 
amplitude  by  the  magnitude  of  the  disturbance,  there  emerges  the  picture  shown  in 
Fig. 2. The sequence in Fig.2 illustrates the pressure relief time history as a function 
of the convection electric field and nonstationary boundary conditions varying as:

One can see that at the time when the plasma bunch reaches the region of maximum 
steady-state  pressure,  there  occurs  a  powerful  short-duration  outlier  of  plasma  pres-
sure (density and, accordingly, intensity of particle precipitation). We interpret it as 
break-up substorms [3].

Since  in  plasma  with  isotropic  pressure  (such  as  observed  in  the  magnetosphere 
within  3.5  <  L  <  7,  where  L  is  the  McIlwain  parameter)  the  plasma  pressure  relief 
wholly determines the density of bulk currents for particles with the energy less than 
15 keV, then: 
 

j⊥ = c [Bx∇pg]/B2 ,                                                    (1) 

 
where  B  is  the  magnetic  field  strength,  pg  is  gas  pressure,  and  c  is  the  velocity  of 
light. 
 
Formulation of the problem and computational technique 
 
The flux density of precipitating particles is rather sharply localized in the space and 
produces at the Earth a clearly pronounced precipitation oval (Fig. 3). 
Sharp spatially localized regions of increased conductivity in the ionosphere also cor-
respond to such a distribution of precipitation. In the energy range 1-20 keV in which 
auroral electrons exist, about 30 electron-volt of the flux energy supplied to the iono-
sphere are expended in producing an electron-ion pair. Hence the ionization rate is ~ 
jε/Hδε  (δε  in  ergs),  where  jε  is  the  energy  flux  density  of  precipitating  electrons 
(ergs/cm), and the electron density in steady-state conditions: 
 

ne ~ (jε/Hδεα)1/2                                                                 (2)

conditions: a) t=0 s, b) t=1000 s, c) t=2800 s, d) t=4500 s. 

                             
Integral conductivity for the Pedersen current is: 
 

Σр= (e2ne/Mi )∫νin/(ωiB

2 + νin

2)dz ,                                                    (3) 

 
where e is the electron charge, Mi is the ion mass, ωiB is the ion gyrofrequency, and 
νin is the  ion-neutral collision frequency. The domain of integration is throughout the 
entire dynamo-region, i.e. from 100 to 120 km. 
Observational data and theoretical estimates show that the scale of the electric field 
along  the  latitude  is  several  times  larger  than  the  scale  of  precipitation  and,  hence, 
than the scale of the conductivity region. Therefore: 
 

∂J/∂θ = (∂Σp/∂θ)Eθ  +  (∂Eθ/∂θ)Σp ~ Eθ ∂Σp/∂θ             

(4) 

         

Hence it follows that the electric field configuration is unimportant for the problem of 
generation  of  field-aligned  currents  in  the  ionosphere,  at  least  for  the  divergence  of 
those  Pedersen  currents,  which  flow  along  the  latitude  and  produce  “curtain”  struc-
tures.  Of  importance  are  the  parameters  of  precipitation,  the  intensity  of  which  is 
closely  associated  with  the  spatial  distribution  of  the  number  density  of  particles  in 
the magnetosphere and, hence, with the pressure relief. For that reason, there must be 
a  correspondence  between  the  picture  of  field-aligned  currents  calculated  from  the 
gas  pressure  distribution  in  the  magnetosphere  and  the  picture  of  field-aligned  cur-
rents calculated from the distribution of ionization (i.e. precipitation!). It is this rea-
soning that dictated the formulation of the problem. At the first stage of research, the 
result  of  which  are  presented  in  this  paper,  we  present  the  pictures  of  field-aligned 
current distribution inferred in terms of a very simple model. 
     Calculations were performed by the formula: 
 
 

j

(cid:45) ≈ jr = [∂Jλ/∂λ + cosθaJθ  +  sinθa∂J/∂θ]/rosinθa     (5) 

Since in high latitudes the direction of geomagnetic field lines is close to a radial di-
rection,  we  identified  the  field-aligned  currents  in  the  ionosphere  with  radial  ones. 
The error arising in this case in the value of the field-aligned current for the auroral 
zone  is  less  than  20%.  Surface  densities  of  Pedersen  currents  along  the  latitude,  Jλ, 
and along the meridian, Jθ, were calculated by standard formulas: 
 

Jλ = ΣpEλ      and      Jθ = Σp Eθ                                                    (6)

Results of calculations of field-aligned currents “generated” in the ionosphere are
shown in Fig. 4. 
     It should be noted that only the sign of the field-aligned current whose ampli-
tude  exceeded  some  given  value,  was  plotted.  For  comparison,  for  the  same  in-
stants of time Fig. 5 presents the signs of field-aligned currents generated in the
magnetosphere.

Discussion of results 
 
     The  problem  of  conjugation  of  field-aligned  currents  generated  in  the  magneto-
sphere, and of field-aligned currents, which are produced as a result of a spatial in-
homogeneity of conductivity (and to a lesser extent, of the electric field), that is, as if 
they  were  “generated”  in  the  ionosphere,  is  part  of  the  problem  of  ionosphere-
magnetosphere coupling. It is clear that in actual fact they are simply parts of one and 
the  same  global  ionospheric-magnetospheric  current  system.  The  problem  of  iono-
sphere-magnetosphere  coupling  primarily  implies  that  it  is  necessary  to  solve  the 
question as to how the magnetospheric producer of current and power “adjusts itself” 
to  the  ionospheric  consumer.  For  a  certain  special  configuration,  this  problem  was 
solved by P.A. Sedykh [4,5]. 
     It  turned  out,  firstly,  that  the  ionospheric  consumer  updates  the  convection  rate 
and  through  it  the  plasma  pressure  gradient,  which  determines  the  density  of  bulk 
currents which, in turn, determines the behavior of field-aligned currents through its 
divergence. Secondly, it turned out that ionospheric and magnetospheric currents are 
not  rigidly  linked.  Some  of  the  current  (and  power!)  that  is  not  “demanded”  by  the 
ionosphere can go into feeding the MHD compressor pumping plasma into the region 
of increase magnetic pressure - in the earthward direction. 
     For us, the most important issue in this paper is that of ascertaining the direction 
of  the  cause-and-effect  relationship.  Current  is  primary  in  the  magnetosphere, 
whereas the electric field is primary in the magnetosphere. Furthermore, the convec-
tion system can undergo some adjustment, and together with it the electric field in the 
ionosphere. But such adjustment is possibly only as corrections of the first approxi-
mation  to  the  zero-order  approximation.  And  hence  the  zero-order  approximation, 
that  is,  the  picture  of  field-aligned  currents  obtained  essentially  for  an  arbitrary  but 
smooth initial electric field must contain the main elements of the natural system of 
field-aligned currents which is determine by the distribution of electron precipitation 
closely associated with the plasma pressure distribution in the magnetosphere. Let us 
now consider from this standpoint Figs. 4 and 5. 
     Fig. 4 shows a classical picture of field-aligned currents that coincides in its main 
traits with the well-known Iijima-Potemra scheme [1]. This correspondence indicates 
that the factor that determines the main features of the configuration of field-aligned 
currents is the existence in the ionosphere of a well conducting channel produced by 
zones of intense precipitation of electrons from the plasma pressure hump region (see 
Figs. 1 and 3).

Fig.  6.  A  -  ionospheric  region  with  background  (low)  conductivity.  B  -  ionospheric 
region  with  increased  conductivity.  The  portion  A1  -A2    has  a  large-scale  (quasi-
homogeneous) meridional electric field EA
λ  that produces the electric current. If the 
source  of  current  I  in  the  corresponding  magnetospheric  region  is  absent,  then  the 
current j flows in the entire portion A1 -A2 ; however, the electric field in region B, 
EB
λ  ,  is  decreased.  If,  however,  the  source  of  current  I  is  present  in  the  magneto-
  is everywhere identical, and on portion B the electric  current jB  is 
sphere, then Eλ
enhanced. Hence in the former case jB  = j0  and EB
λ , and in the latter case 
EB
 
 
However, whether or not the enhancement of current in this channel with enhanced 
conductivity is possible will depend on whether the magnetospheric source is able to 
supply field-aligned currents this peculiar “discharge gap”, as shown in Fig.6.  
Fig.  5  shows  the  picture  of  field-aligned  currents  that  is  “offered”  by  the  magneto-
sphere. One can see that “demand” and “supply” are more or less identical for the ar-
rangements of the zones. It should be noted that the integral over all inflow and out-
flow currents in Fig. 5 is virtually zero. 
 
Conclusion 
 
     The results presented in this study induce us to hope that the conjugation of field-
aligned currents of magnetospheric and ionospheric origins is feasible.

Summary.  Complex-dynamical  fractal  is  a  hierarchy  of  permanently,  chaotically  changing  versions  of 
system  structure,  obtained  as  the  unreduced,  causally  probabilistic  general  solution  to  an  arbitrary 
interaction problem. Intrinsic creativity of this extension of usual  fractality determines its exponentially 
high operation efficiency, which underlies many specific functions of living systems, such as autonomous 
adaptability, “purposeful” development, intelligence and consciousness (at higher complexity levels). We 
outline  in  more  detail  genetic  applications  of  complex-dynamic  fractality,  demonstrate  the  dominating 
role of genome interactions, and show that further progressive development of genetic research, as well as 
other life-science applications, should be based on the dynamically fractal structure analysis of interaction 
processes  involved.  We  finally  summarise  the  obtained  extension  of  mathematical  concepts  and 
approaches closely related to their biological applications.

The  success  of  fractal  paradigm  in  bio-system  structure  analysis,  as  presented  in  this 
series of conferences [1-3], reflects high efficiency of fractal geometry in life function 
realisation  conceived  and  used  by  nature  itself.  In  a  broader  sense,  fractal  structure 
efficiency  appears  inevitably  and  naturally  in  a  wide  variety  of  real  processes,  from 
physico-chemical  structures  to  economic  system  evolution  [4-8],  driven  by  unreduced 
interaction  processes  and  often  referred  to  as  systems  with  complex  dynamics.  Using 
the  universally  nonperturbative  analysis  of  a  generic  interaction  process,  we  have 
rigorously  specified  the  connection  between  fractality  and  dynamic  complexity  [9,10], 
where  the  extended,  complex-dynamic  fractality  has  been  derived  as  inevitably 
emerging structure of any real interaction process. In that way, the dynamic complexity 
as  such  acquires  a  rigorous  and  universally  applicable  definition,  while  the  fractal 
structure of a real interaction is obtained as the truly complete, dynamically multivalued 
(probabilistic) general solution of a problem, replacing its reduced, dynamically single-
valued (regular) version. The dynamically probabilistic, permanently changing fractal of 
real  system  dynamics  is  a  natural  extension  of  the  canonical,  “geometric”  fractality 
possessing  an  involved,  but  basically  predictable  (regular)  and  fixed  structure. 
Complex-dynamic  fractality  is  not  a  “model”  any  more,  but  the  unreduced  version  of 
any real, “nonintegrable” and “nonseparable” system structure and dynamics, which is 
especially interesting for fractality involvement with living systems because it provides 
rigorously  derived  versions  of  those  essential  life  properties  —  such  as  intrinsic 
adaptability, self-development and “reasonable” behaviour — that determine its specific 
efficiency and remain largely “mysterious” within usual, perturbative theory. 

In  this  report,  after  recalling  the  mathematical  framework  of  complex-dynamic 
fractality  (section  2),  we  proceed  to  further  exploration  of  its  properties  important  for 
life-science applications. We show that due to the hierarchy of unceasing probabilistic 
change  of  the  living  fractal  structure,  its  power  to  perform  useful  functions  grows

exponentially with the number of elements, contrary to power-law dependence in usual, 
dynamically single-valued models (section 3). Being applied to various important cases 
of  interaction  development  in  living  organisms,  such  as  genome  dynamics  or  brain 
operation,  this  result  explains  their  huge,  qualitative  advantages  with  respect  to  any 
conventional  simulation  that  underlie  all  the  “miracles  of  life”  (self-reproduction, 
adaptable  evolution,  intelligence,  consciousness,  etc.).  Important  practical  conclusions 
for genetic research strategy are derived from the unreduced fractal structure of genome 
interaction dynamics (section 4). In that way we substantiate and specify the necessary 
change  in  life  sciences  and  related  fields,  which  can  uniquely  solve  the  growing 
“difficult”  (e.g.  “ethical”)  problems  of  the  modern  blind,  purely  empirical  technology 
development  and  provide  the  basis  for  the  truly  sustainable  future.  The  latter  involves 
genuine,  causally  complete  understanding  and  control  of  living  form  emergence  and 
dynamics,  at any level of interest,  giving rise to  new possibilities in both fundamental 
(e.g.  mathematical)  and  applied  aspects  of  knowledge,  including  such  directions  as 
constructive genetics and integral medicine [9,10].

We  start  from  interaction  problem  between arbitrary  (but  known)  system  components, 
such  as  brain  neurons,  cell  elements,  or  genes.  It  can  be  expressed  by  the  existence 
equation that generalises many particular, model dynamic equations [9-13]:

Although the EP expression of a problem, eqs. (8)-(12), is formally equivalent to 
its initial version, eqs. (1), (2), (5), only the former reveals, due to its “dynamically rich” 
structure, the essential features designated as dynamic multivaluedness (or redundance) 
and  entanglement  and  remaining  hidden  in  the  conventional  formalism  and  especially 
its perturbative form of “exact” (or closed) solutions. Dynamic multivaluedness appears 
as redundant number of locally complete, and therefore incompatible, but equally real 
problem  solutions,  called  realisations,  while  dynamic  entanglement  describes  the 
related  “cohesion” between interacting  components within each realisation, expressing 
system  “nonseparability”.  Because  of  equal  reality  and  incompatibility  of  realisations, 
the system is forced, by the driving interaction itself, to permanently change them in a 
causally  random  order,  forming  each  time  a  new  version  of  component  entanglement. 
The  total  number  of  eigen-solutions  can  be  estimated  by  the  maximum  power  of  the 
characteristic  equation  for  eq.  (8).  If Nξ and
are  the  numbers  of  terms  in  the  sums 
over  i  and  n  in  eq.  (9b),  equal  to  the  numbers  of  system  components  (N)  and  their

, 
internal  states,  then  the  eigenvalue  number  is 
N N N
(
Q
Q
ξ ξ
which gives the  Nξ -fold redundance of usual “complete” set of 
 eigen-solutions 
of eqs. (5) plus an  additional, “incomplete” set of 
Nξ  eigen-solutions. The number of 
“regular”  realisations  is 
,  whereas  the  truncated  set  of  solutions  forms  a 
N
specific, “intermediate” realisation that plays the role of transitional state during chaotic 
system  jumps  between  “regular”  realisations  and  provides  thus  the  universal,  causally 
complete extension of the quantum wavefunction and classical distribution function [9-
13].  Note  that  dynamic  multivaluedness  is  obtained  only  in  the  unreduced  EP  version 
(starting  from  the  genuine  quantum  chaos  description  [14,15]),  whereas  practically  all 
scholar applications of this well-known approach (see e.g. [16]) resort to its perturbative 
reduction  that  kills  inevitably  all  manifestations  of  complex  (chaotic)  dynamics  and  is 
equivalent  to  the  dynamically  single-valued,  effectively  zero-dimensional  (point-like) 
model of reality, containing only one, “averaged” system realisation (or projection). 
 
The  discovered  multivaluedness  of  the  unreduced  solution  and  the  ensuing 
chaoticity of unceasing realisation change are expressed by the truly complete general

also  valid  for  any  single  event  observation  and  even  before  it,  providing  a  priori

is given also by the generalised Born rule [9,11,12], derived by dynamic matching and

r   is  the  r-th  realisation  configuration,  while  the  wavefunction  can  be  found 

where 
from the universal, causally derived Schrödinger equation [9,11,12]. 
Dynamic complexity, C, can be universally defined now as any growing function 
 
of system realisation number, or rate of their change, equal to zero for only one system 
( )1
= . It is the latter case of zero unreduced 
realisation: 
complexity that is invariably considered in the canonical, dynamically single-valued, or 
unitary, theory, which explains all its old and new difficulties at various levels of world 
dynamics  [9-13].  The  unreduced  dynamic  complexity  is  presented  by  the  majority  of 
actually  measured  quantities,  such  as  energy,  mass,  momentum,  action,  and  entropy, 
now  provided  with  a  universal  and  essentially  nonlinear  interpretation  in  terms  of  the 
underlying  interaction  processes.  Space  and  time  are  two  universal,  physically  real 
forms  of  complexity,  causally  derived  as  tangible  quality  of  dynamically  entangled 
structure  and  immaterial  rate  (frequency)  of  realisation  change  events,  respectively. 
Complex  dynamics  is  a  structure  emergence  process  (dynamically  multivalued  self-
organisation) and can be described by the universal Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the 
generalised  action,  which  is  dualistically  related  to  the  universal  Schrödinger  equation 
mentioned  above  through  the  causal  quantization  condition  (it  reflects  realisation 
change by transition through the intermediate realisation of the wavefunction) [9,11,12]. 
Note finally that dynamic complexity thus defined represents at the same time universal 
measure of genuine and omnipresent chaoticity and (generalised) entropy. 
 
The  complex-dynamic,  intrinsically  probabilistic  fractality  represents  the 
inevitable development and internal content of dynamic entanglement (nonseparability), 
complexity and chaoticity.  It is related to problem nonintegrability as it appears in EP 
dependence  on  the  unknown  solutions  of  the  auxiliary  system  of  equations,  eqs.  (10). 
After we have revealed dynamic system splitting into chaotically changing realisations 
at  the  first  level  of  nonperturbative  dynamics,  we  should  now  proceed  with  further 
analysis  of  the  auxiliary  system  solutions,  which  introduce  additional  structure  in  the 
general  solution.  Due  to  the  unrestricted  universality  of  the  generalised  EP  method,  it 
can  be  applied  to  the  truncated  system  (10),  transforming  it  into  a  single  effective 
equation, quite similar to the first-level EP result of eq. (8):

The same mechanism of dynamic multivaluedness due to the  essentially  nonlinear EP 
dependence on the eigen-solutions to be found in eqs. (16)-(17) leads to the second level 
of  splitting,  this  time  of  auxiliary  system  solutions  entering  the  first-level  expressions

We  can  continue  to  trace  this  hierarchy  of  dynamical  splitting  by  applying  the 
same  EP  method  to  ever  more  truncated  systems  of  equations,  such  as  eqs.  (18),  and 
obtaining corresponding levels of dynamically multivalued structures with the attached 
intrinsic space and time, until we obtain a directly integrable equation for one unknown 
function. The maximum number of levels in this dynamically multivalued hierarchy is 
equal to the number of component states (excitations) 
, although in practice each of 
them  need  not  be  resolved.  We  can  now  specify  the  detailed,  probabilistically  fractal 
structure of the complete general solution to the interaction problem, eq. (13):

Multivalued  fractal  solution  of  eqs.  (20)-(22)  can  be  obtained  in  a  number  of 
versions,  but  with  the  same  essential  result  of  probabilistically  adapting  hierarchy  of 
realisations.  Consecutive  level  emergence  of  unreduced  dynamic  fractality  should  be 
distinguished  from  perturbative  series  expansion:  the  latter  provides  a  qualitatively 
incorrect,  generically  “diverging”  (because  of  dynamic  single-valuedness  [9]) 
approximation  for  a  single  level  of  structure,  while  the  series  of  levels  of  dynamic 
fractality corresponds to really emerging structures, where each level is obtained in its 
unreduced,  dynamically  multivalued  and  entangled  version.  In  fact,  the  ultimately 
complete, dynamically fractal version of the general solution demonstrates the genuine, 
physically  transparent  origin  of  a  generic  problem  “nonintegrability”  (absence  of  a 
“closed”, unitary solution) and related “nonseparability” (now being clearly due to the 
physical, fractally structured and chaotically changing component entanglement). 
The dynamically probabilistic fractal thus obtained is a natural extension of the 
 
ordinary,  dynamically  single-valued  (basically  regular)  fractality,  which  is  especially

important  for  life-science  applications  because  it  possesses  the  essential  living  system 
properties  absent  in  any  unitary  model,  including  autonomous  dynamic  adaptability, 
“purposeful” self-development, intrinsic mixture of omnipresent randomness with often 
implicit  but  strong  order,  and  the  resulting  qualitatively  superior  dynamic  efficiency. 
These properties are unified within the universal dynamic symmetry, or conservation, of 
complexity  [9,11,12]  providing  the  general  framework  for  the  described  process  of 
interaction development into a probabilistically fractal structure. The initial interaction 
configuration, as described by the starting equations (1), (2), (5), is characterised by the 
latent,  “potential”  complexity  form  of  dynamic  information,  universally  measured  by 
generalised  action.  System  structure  emergence  in  the  form  of  unreduced  dynamical 
fractal, eqs. (8)-(22), is described by unceasing transformation of dynamic information 
into a dual complexity form, dynamic entropy, generalising the usual entropy to any real 
system dynamics and reflecting the fully developed structure. Symmetry of complexity 
means  that  the  sum  of  dynamic  information  and  entropy,  or  total  complexity,  remains 
unchanged for any given system or process, which gives rise to the universal Hamilton-
Schrödinger  formalism  mentioned  above  and  extended,  causally  complete  versions  of 
all other (correct) laws and principles. Due to the intrinsic randomness of the unreduced 
fractality and contrary to any unitary symmetry, the universal symmetry of complexity 
relates  irregular,  configurationally  “asymmetric”  structures  and  elements,  while 
remaining  always  exact  (unbroken),  which  is  especially  important  for  description  of 
biological,  explicitly  irregular,  but  internally  ordered  structures.  Constituting  thus  the 
unreduced  symmetry  of  natural  structures,  the  symmetry  of  complexity  extends 
somewhat too regular symmetry of usual fractals and approaches the fractal paradigm to 
the unreduced complexity of living organism structure and dynamics.

The  probabilistic  dynamical  fractal,  eqs.  (8)-(22),  emerges  as  a  single  whole, 
which means that the fractal hierarchy of realisations appears and adapts its structure in 
a “real-time” period, comparable with the time of structure formation of the first level of 
fractality.  This  is  the  complex-dynamical,  multivalued,  genuine  parallelism  of  real 
system dynamics absent in unitary models that try to imitate it by artificial division of 
sequential  thread  of  events  between  simultaneously  working  multiple  units  of 
interaction,  which  can  be  useful,  but  does  not  provide  any  true  gain  in  power.  By 
contrast, the real, exponential power increase is obtained in natural systems with many 
interacting  units  at  the  expense  of  irreducible  dynamic  randomness,  which  constitutes 
the necessary, but actually quite advantageous “payment” for the huge power growth of 
creative  interaction  processes  (whereas  any  unitary,  regular  dynamics  is  strictly 
deprived of genuine creativity).

0P   is  a  coefficient  conveniently  taken  to  be  equal  to  the  corresponding  unitary 
power  value  (dynamically  single-valued,  sequential  operation  model,  or  “generalised 
Turing  machine”).  Then  the  relative  growth  of  complex-dynamical  fractal  power  with 
respect to unitary model,  Pδ , is given by the unreduced system complexity, which can

eq. (23) produces not only quantitative, but also qualitative effects appearing as various 
“miracles” of “living” and “intelligent” behaviour that cannot be convincingly imitated 
by unitary models (and now we know the exact, fundamental reason for that). 
The estimate of eq. (23) refers, however, to a single interaction “run” at a given 
 
level  of  complexity  describing  the  emergence  of  one  “compound”,  fractally  structured 
realisation of the first level. System structure formation in the process of its operation 
does not stop there and involves a hierarchy of interactions at superior levels, where the 
above  fractal  structure  within  a  given  level  plays  the  role  of  distributed  “interaction 
transmitter” between harder, first-level parts of fractality. This means that the dynamic 
fractal grows, starting from a given interaction level, not only “in depth” (to generally 
smaller scales and lower complexity sublevels), but also to higher complexity levels. In 
order  to  estimate  the  total  relative  efficiency  of  such  systems  of  “biologically  high” 
complexity, consider a many-body interaction system consisting of 
 operative units 
(such  as  neurons,  or  genes,  or  relevant  cell  components)  each  of  them  connected  by 
  effective  links  to  other  units,  so  that  the  total  number  of  interaction  links  in  the

Causally complete genetics, integral medicine, and other

Causally  complete  understanding  of  complex-dynamical  fractal  structure  development 
in real biological and bio-inspired systems leads to a number of promising applications 
in  life  sciences,  where  modification  and  control  of  bio-system  dynamics  deal  with  its 
realistic,  unreduced  version  and  are  comparable  with  natural  creation  processes.  The 
relevant examples include (see also [9-11]) (1) causally complete understanding and use 

   Complex-Dynamic Fractality and Its Applications in Life Sciences                                             9 

of  the  natural  biological  evolution  dynamics,  involving  both  relative  permanence  and 
sudden  “reasonable”  change  of  species;  (2)  causally  complete  genetics  taking  into 
account the whole picture of real genome interactions and thus providing the desirable 
and  reliable  modifications;  (3)  unreduced  understanding  of  the  brain  dynamics  and 
emergent,  dynamic  properties  of intelligence  and  consciousness;  (4)  integral  medicine 
based  on  the  causally  complete  understanding  and  creative  control  of  each  individual 
organism dynamics; (5) genuine paradigm of nanotechnology based on the irreducibly 
complex  (multivalued)  dynamics  of  nano-scale  structures  approaching  them  to  the 
natural,  biological  nano-machines;  and  (6)  ecological  and  social  applications  of  the 
unreduced  (multivalued)  fractality  and  complexity  characterised  by  the  intrinsically 
holistic  analysis  of  the  multi-level  systems  involved  and  providing  provably  efficient 
solutions to the “global” problems (that cannot be solved within the unitary  approach, 
irrespective of the quantity of efforts [9]). Only such unreduced understanding of real 
system dynamics can solve the growing “ethical” problems in practical research. 
We  shall  consider  here  a  more  detailed  outline  of  genetic  applications,  as  they 
 
become especially important because of the growing conceptually blind, but technically 
powerful empirical experimentation with genomes of various organisms. The key result, 
strongly  supported  by  both  experimental  knowledge  and  the  above  theory,  is  that  the 
genome  structure,  operation,  evolution,  and  related  organism  phenotype  are  mainly 
determined  by  fractally  structured  genome  interactions  and  not  by  sequential 
“programme  reading”  à  la  Turing  machine,  as  it  is  assumed  by  the  current  theory  and 
applications.  Such  understanding  of  genome  dynamics  is  supported  by  the  ensuing 
unified  solution  to  the  well-known  problem  of  “noncoding  DNA”,  relatively  large  in 
quantity,  but  apparently  “useless”,  in  the  framework  of  unitary  genetic  paradigm.  We 
can  see  now  that  the  existence  of  those  relatively  large  DNA  sections  is  necessary  as 
fractally  structured  gene  interaction  space  and  transmitter,  similar  to  any  real 
interaction process and in agreement with experimentally observed correlation between 
organism complexity and relative volume of those noncoding DNA parts [17]. 

As follows from sections 2 and 3, a unitary genetic programme cannot provide 
“reasonable”  development  and  would  actually halt  in  any  realistic  operation  mode.  Its 
efficiency  is  smaller  than  that  of  a  real,  dynamically  multivalued,  fractal  interaction 
process by a practically infinite quantity given by eq. (24). Unfortunately, this does not 
exclude  a  possibility  of  purely  empirical  genome  modification  whose  immediate 
consequences,  considered  only  within  severely  reduced  unitary  model,  cover  only  a 
negligibly  small  part  of  actually  introduced  change  in  the  whole  system  dynamics, 
remaining delayed in time and therefore “hidden” in mechanistic experimentation.

 is the experimentally determined number of smallest chemical elements 
(“bases”) in the human genome. This strongly supports the above idea that the main part 
of genome is playing the role of effective “interaction space” and only its smaller part 
appears  as  relatively  “condensed”,  stable,  coding  gene  sequences  (also  contributing  to 
omnipresent  interaction  links  through  various  transmitting  agents).  The  fact  that 
 shows that interactions of each (average) gene involve, in one way 
N
or another, any individual base and the reverse, any (average) base participates in every 
gene  operation.  Such  incredible  wholeness  of  the  huge  system  of  genome  interactions 
can  be  realised  only  through  the  probabilistic  fractal  hierarchy  of  emerging  system 
realisations, in agreement with the detailed analysis of sections 2, 3. It is interesting that 
N
for  human  genome  and  brain  we  have 
,  which 
confirms  the  symmetry  of  complexity  [9-12]  unifying  the  probabilistically  developing 
fractal  of  human  organism  dynamics  into  a  single  whole,  from  genome  information 
unfolding  to  the  brain  operation.  We  can  apply  the  same,  universal  understanding  of 
fractal interaction dynamics and its exponentially high efficiency to other biological and 
bio-inspired  systems  of  particular  interest today,  such  as  neuron  system  dynamics  and 
its “higher” properties known as intelligence and consciousness [9,11], various aspects 
of cell dynamics, artificial nanosystems [11], ecological and social systems, etc. 
 
The  probabilistically  changing,  fractal  hierarchy  of  genome  dynamics  provides 
also the necessary combination of relative stability of a species genome and its capacity 
for rare evolutionary changes. The latter can now be causally understood as the largest, 
most  “coarse-grained”  level  of  probabilistic  realisation  change  at  the  level  of  whole 
genome  and  organism  dynamics.  Such  “global”  changes  are  prepared  by  hidden 
potentialities  accumulated  from  all  interactions  in  the  genome-organism-environment 
system and particularly “activated” in a “period of change” characterised by especially 
heavy  pressure  of  the  environment  and  critically  dominating  defects  of  genome 
dynamics.  Those  real  potentialities  for  a  future  “big”  change  cannot  appear  as  such 
before  the  change  and  remain  hidden  somewhere  in  the  exponentially  large,  fractally 
involved space of genome interactions, thus ensuring the necessary (but always limited) 
stability  of  species  genome  in  a  period  between  those  big,  evolutionary  changes. 
Therefore  it  becomes  evident  that  empirically  based  artificial  modifications  of  any 
organism  genome  (related  by  a  fractal  interaction  network  to  other  organisms)  will 
produce  absolutely  unknown  and  unpredictable  (but  typically  destructive)  effect  on 
higher-level interactions that will appear in their explicitly observable form only during 
the  next  period  of  “big”  change,  remaining  until  then  hidden  behind  superficially 
smooth  “everyday”  level  of  organism  dynamics.  That  the  “big  change”  will  come 
inevitably in an evolutionary short period of time follows from the same symmetry of 
the 
complexity,  which 
fundamentally  limited  life  cycle  of  any  system,  including  a  biological  species  and  its 
ecological niche. It is determined by the complete transformation of system interaction 
complexity from “potentialities” (dynamic information) to “reality” (dynamic entropy), 
where characteristic, observable signs of approaching “bifurcation” can be predicted [9] 
and correlate with a number of currently growing “criticality” features. The technically 
powerful, but conceptually blind genetic experimentation of today can be compared in 
this sense to charging of delayed-action “genetic bomb”, or G-bomb, another potential 
weapons  of  mass  destruction  (though  remaining  unpredictable  in  details),  where  the 
“charging”  process  has  a  transparent  physical  meaning  of  introducing  additional, 

the  causally  substantiated  conclusion  about 

leads 

to

“unnatural”  tensions  in  the  “infinitely”  large  network  of  fractal  interactions  (eq.  (24)), 
among  which  only  some  part  will  explicitly  appear  in  the  observed  properties  of 
organism dynamics. It is also evident that the problem can be solved only by essential 
extension  of  unitary  approaches  to  the  unreduced,  multivalued  and  fractal  interaction 
dynamics,  taking  into  account  all  participating  elements,  as  it  is  demonstrated  by  the 
above  analysis,  which  can  uniquely  transform  the  empirical,  potentially  destructive 
unitary genetics into provably constructive complex-dynamical genetics. 
 
Note  finally  the  essential  extension  of  mathematical  concepts  and  approaches 
involved  with  that  urgently  needed  progress  in  applications,  as  the  development  of 
fundamental  science  tools  represents  also  its  own  interest,  especially  evident  on  the 
background  of  persisting  stagnation  [9,11,18]  and  “loss  of  certainty”  in  fundamental 
knowledge (cf. [19]). (i) First of all, one should mention the nonuniqueness of any real 
problem  solution,  taking  the  form  of  its  dynamic  multivaluedness  (section  2),  and 
related complex-dynamic existence of any system that replace the usual “uniqueness and 
existence  theorems”  valid  only  for  reduced,  unitary  models  [9].  (ii)  It  follows  that  the 
related  unitary  concept  of  “exact”  (closed)  solutions  and  its  perturbative  versions  are 
basically insufficient and fundamentally incorrect with respect to real world structures. 
The true, dynamical meaning of the notions of “(non)integrability”, “(non)separability”, 
“(non)computability”,  “uncertainty”,  “randomness”,  and  “probability”  becomes  clear: 
we obtain now the nonintegrable and nonseparable, but solvable dynamics of a generic 
many-body  system  (see  eqs.  (8)-(22)),  while  real  world  mathematics  regains  its 
certainty  and  unification,  but  contains  a  well-defined,  dynamic  indeterminacy  and 
fractally  structured  diversity  (i.e.  it  cannot  be  reduced  to  number  properties  and 
geometry, contrary to unitary hopes). (iii) The property of dynamic entanglement and its 
fractal  extension  (section  2)  provides  the  rigorous  mathematical  definition  of  the 
tangible quality of a structure, applicable at any level of dynamics, which contributes to 
the  truly  exact  mathematical  representation  of  real  objects,  especially  important  for 
biological  applications.  (iv)  The  irreducible  dynamic  discreteness,  or  quantization,  of 
real  interaction  dynamics  expresses  its  holistic  character  and  introduces  essential 
modification  in  standard  calculus  applications  and  their  formally  discrete  versions, 
including  “evolution  operators”,  “Lyapunov  exponents”,  “path  integrals”,  etc.  [9,11]. 
(v)  The  unceasing,  probabilistic  change  of  system  realisations  provides  the  dynamic 
origin of time, absent in any version of unitary theory: in the new mathematics and in 
the real world one always has  a
 for any measurable, realistically expressed quantity 
or  structure 
,  while  one  of  the  basic,  often  implicit  postulates  of  the  canonical 
a=   (related  to  “computability”).  It  has  a  direct  bio-
mathematics  is  “self-identity”,  a
inspired  implication:  every  real  structure 
  is  “alive”  and  “noncomputable”,  in  the 
a
sense  that  it  always  probabilistically  moves  and  changes  internally.  In  fact,  any 
realistically  conceived 
  represents  a  part  of  a  single,  unified  structure  of  the  new 
mathematics introduced above as dynamically multivalued (probabilistic) fractal (of the 
world structure) and obtained as the truly exact, unreduced solution of a real interaction 
problem  (section  2).  We  can  see  in  that  way  that  such  recently  invented  terms  as 
“biofractals”  and  “biomathematics”  can  have  much  deeper  meaning  and  importance 
than usually implied “(extensive) use of mathematics in biological object studies”.

Langmuir wave self-focusing versus decay instability

Harvey A. Rosea

Los Alamos National Laboratory

Electron trapping in a finite amplitude Langmuir wave (LW) leads to a frequency shift,

∆ω

TP

< 0 , and reduced Landau damping.  These may lead to modulational instability.  Its

growth rate and damping threshold, due to escape of trapped electrons at rate ν, are

calculated for the first time in the short wavelength regime.  If the background plasma is

in thermal equilibrium, it is shown that this trapped particle modulational instability

(TPMI) is not possible when  kλ

> 0.46, while for 0.33 < kλ

< 0.46 , TPMI requires that

D

D

the fluctuation wavevector have a component perpendicular to k, the LW wavevector,

with  λ

D  the electron Debye length.  Its nonlinear evolution leads to self-focusing.

Comparison is made with a re-evaluated LW ion acoustic decay instability (LDI):

compared to classical estimates, the new LDI threshold is lowered by primary LW ∆ω

TP

since frequency matching leads to wavenumber and hence damping reduction of the

daughter LW.  For parameters estimates relevant to a recent stimulated Raman scatter

experiment (Kline et al., submitted to PRL), the LDI and TPMI thresholds cross in the

range 0.28 < kλ

< 0.34 , consistent with the observed LDI regime change.  However, if ν

D

exceeds a critical value, estimated to be order 1% of the electron plasma frequency, then

TPMI is not possible at any wavenumber.

I. INTRODUCTION

A Langmuir wave’s angular frequency, ω, depends on its amplitude, represented here by

its electrostatic potential, φ, through a variety of mechanisms.  One example is the wave’s

ponderomotive force: it induces a low frequency plasma density fluctuation, δn ∝ φ2 , and

hence a shift in the wave frequency since the electron plasma frequency, ω

p , is, of

course, density dependent.  When combined with ion acoustic wave dynamics, as in

Zakharov’s model1 of Langmuir wave (LW) turbulence, this frequency shift leads to the

LW ion acoustic decay instability2 (LDI) and LW collapse3.  If the LW’s wavenumber, k,

is much greater than  k*

known, the LDI growth rate4, γ

induces a modulational instability whose growth rate varies as φ2k2 , so that LDI is

dominant for small enough φ.

density plasma, in particular, the quantitative measurement9 of large  kλ

D  Langmuir

waves generated by backward stimulated Raman scatter (SRS), motivates the main

subject of the current study: extension of TPMI theory into the short wavelength regime.

After reviewing the basic model in section II.A, an analytic large- kλ

D -valid expression

for ∆ω

TP  is reviewed in section II.B and compared with various perturbative results.

Comparison with a LW’s ponderomotive force induced frequency shift is presented in

section II.C.

Various TPMI regimes are discussed in section III.A.  Positive LW dispersion8 is

required for instability since ∂ ∆ω

(

) ∂φ < 0.  If the LW propagates in the “z” direction,

TP

then positive dispersion requires either ∂2ω ∂kx

2 = ∂2ω ∂ky

2 > 0 , and/or ∂2ω ∂kz

2 > 0 .  If φ

is small, i.e., eφ Te

<< 1, it is shown in section III.A that these inequalities are satisfied

for  kλ

D

< 0.33.  But LW dispersion is mixed for 0.33 < kλ

< 0.46: ∂2ω ∂kx

2 > 0  while

D

∂2ω ∂kz

2 < 0 . For  kλ

D

> 0.46, dispersion is negative in all directions.  3D wave packet

collapse is possible in the first wavenumber regime; 2D self-focusing in the x-y plane in

the second, mixed dispersion, regime; and TPMI is not possible in the third.  If φ is not

small, it will be shown that these regimes move to smaller  kλ

D .  In the second regime,

1D models would miss TPMI that might otherwise occur in 2D and 3D models.

5/4/04                                                           3                                                      H. A. Rose

Since LDI has been unambiguously observed9 in the large  kλ

D  regime, comparison of its

growth rate (section III.B) and threshold (section III.C) with TPMI’s is natural.  It will be

shown that the TPMI amplitude damping threshold decreases rapidly with increasing k,

because  ∆ω

TP  is a rapidly increasing function of k, while the residual LW damping,

owing to the loss of trapped electrons, is not.  Conversely, the classical LDI amplitude

threshold increases rapidly with k, because the daughter LW’s Landau damping increases

rapidly with k, and therefore it will be smaller than the TPMI threshold for small enough

kλ

D  (small enough Te ), and visa versa.  However, the LDI frequency/wavenumber

matching constraints are altered by the trapped particle frequency shift of the primary

LW in such a way as to dramatically reduce the LDI threshold, compared to its classical,

value for large  kλ

D .  This new LDI threshold is compared with the TPMI threshold in

section III.C.4.

II. TRAPPED PARTICLE FREQUENCY SHIFT REDUX

Analytic expressions for the trapped particle frequency shift, ∆ω

TP , valid for small  kλ

D

and small eφ Te , have been derived by various authors (see references 5-7). An

expression also valid for finite  kλ

D  and eφ Te  was later obtained by Rose and Russell10

(R&R).  These results are now reviewed.

A.  The basic model: its resonance and damping

The electron dynamics model (see Eq. (5) of R&R) is given by the 1D Vlasov equation

with external source (potential), and a term that represents coupling to a background

plasma.  Let the Langmuir wave source be given by Re φ

[

], with φ

0

constant.  Then in equilibrium11, the harmonic component of the total potential envelope,

φ =electrostatic + φ

0 , with the electrostatic component obtained from Poisson’s equation,

is given by

φ = φ
0

ε. 

This defines the nonlinear dielectric function, ε. Coupling to the background plasma is

modeled by a linear term which, absent φ

0 , causes relaxation, at rate ν, to the background

distribution function12,  f0.  ν may be interpreted as the rate of escape of trapped

electrons.  For convenience, ε is re-expressed in terms of the nonlinear susceptibility, Ξ,

One may use Eq. (7) to simply graph k as a function of v for given φ, and invert this

graph to determine  v k,φ(

) and hence an approximation to the nonlinear plasma mode

dispersion relation18.  Since (4) may be valid for physically large values of φ, one might

shortchange its content by solving Eq. (7) for v perturbatively in  φ.  For example, since

 has a maximum value of  0.534...

(

 at  v v e

≈ 2.12 ≡ v* ve , where the linear

electron-acoustic19 and Langmuir wave branches of the dispersion relation meet, Eq. (7)

has no φ = 0 solutions if  k > 0.534 .  If φ ≠ 0, the maximum value of k for which there is

a resonance must decrease since20

gives a finite result for all  k < 0.534 , as shown in the next section.  This loss of resonance

phenomenon is well known, though it is often conflated with wave breaking21 22.

B. Perturbative evaluation of trapped particle frequency shift

As  v0

loss of linear resonance, the perturbative expansion fails.  Similarly for given k, there is a

maximum value of φ beyond which nonlinear resonance is not possible, and as this value

is approached, Eq. (9) must again fail.  On the LW branch, Fig. 4 shows contours of non-

perturbative ∆ω

For values of φ above the graph of this relation, shown as the solid curve in Fig. 6, the

meaningful26 if φ is close to or beyond, for given k, its loss of resonance value. This loss

of resonance amplitude, as inferred from Eq. (7), is shown as the dashed curve in Fig. 6.

Inside the region27 labeled “∆ω

dominant.  However, given the sharp rise of the solid curve, one expects that trapped

particle effects will dominate at least for φ somewhat above the dashed curve, except that

in this region, there are no traveling wave solutions to the Vlasov equation28.

determined and compared with the LDI growth rate, γ

critical part of a threshold analysis, it is simpler to first compare the growth rates absent

damping.  Electron thermal units are employed in the following:  k → k kD ,  v → v v e

If δφ is unstable, the maximum  TPMI growth rate only depends8 on ∆ω

TP .  However,

the locus of p at which the maximum is attained depends on the diffraction coefficients,

and the frequency of the unstable mode depends on the group velocity.  In order to

understand these aspects of the instability, the group velocity and diffraction coefficients

are calculated in the kinetic (i.e., not necessarily small  kλ

D ) regime.

If 0 < D < − ∆ω

Fig. 9 is the case  k0

the smaller range of k z  in comparison with Fig.10).

The dashed curves shown Fig.10 and Fig. 11 are superficially identical, except for a

change of scale in the  kz  axis.  However, a scale change does not leave the physics

invariant when a source with an independent length scale is added.  For example, if the

source is due to backward stimulated scatter (BSRS) in a diffraction limited laser beam,

the beam width is such a scale.  Also, solutions of (15) may sample Fourier modes far

enough from  0,0,kz

(

) such that the truncated Taylor series in Eq. (14) loses accuracy.

4. Generalized linear dispersive model

If ε is expanded in deviations from ω but not k 0, than instead of Eq. (14) one obtains

where φ p,t

(

)  is the Fourier transform (FT) in space, but not time36.  The dependence of ε

on φ is suppressed. At the TPMI threshold for a large damping rate,  ∆ω

TP  and hence  p

may be large enough to invalidate the expression for LW dispersion, Eq. (20), which

follows from Eq. (14), while Eq. (23) may still be valid.  If the linear variation of ε with p

is extracted, so that the effect of finite group velocity is made explicit, then the remainder

may be identified as generalized LW dispersion.  Instead of Eq. (15) one has:

5/4/04                                                           21                                                      H. A. Rose

Note that ε

expanded in p, it would begin at second order and reduce to the expression given by Eq.

(20).  The solid curves in Fig. 9, Fig.10 and Fig. 11 are contours of  ˆ D 0.  Departures from

its second order expansion, the dashed curves, are apparent in Fig. 9 and Fig.10, and

much less so in Fig. 11 because  kz  for the latter is well past the value at which  Dz

changes sign.  These two contour sets overlap for p → 0 (k → k0 ), as seen in Fig. 9,

Fig.10 and Fig. 11.

5. Nonlinear dispersion

Values of φ of physical interest may be large enough that amplitude dependent diffraction

coefficients must be considered.   In the previous expressions for the linear diffraction

coefficients, Eq. (16), replace ε

0  by ε, as determined by Eqs. (2) and (4), with k and v

related by the nonlinear dispersion relation, Eq. (7).  Note that Eq. (17) for  D⊥  still holds

in the nonlinear regime.  Fig. 12 and Fig. 13 show the resulting  Dz k,φ(

) and  D⊥ k,φ(

respectively, with curves labeled by eφ Te .  The topmost in each of these figures has

coefficients are negative, and TPMI is not possible.  Note that this curve lies below the

loss of resonance curve (see Fig. 15), and therefore is the stronger constraint on TPMI.

5/4/04                                                           24                                                      H. A. Rose

Unlike the generalized linear dispersion model, Eq. (25), the nonlinear diffraction model

has no such counterpart unless φ’s amplitude varies slowly compared to its phase.  Such a

model is called for in a spatial region where one of the diffraction coefficients goes

through zero, a not unlikely scenario when SRS convectively grows from thermal

fluctuations.

B.  Comparison of TPMI and LDI growth rates absent dissipation

The TPMI growth rate, γ

LDI , for a LW with

TPMI

wavenumber  k >> k* , is well known and given (in electron thermal units) by38

γ
LDI

if γ

LDI  is small compared to the ion acoustic frequency,  kcs .  Solution of the full

dispersion relation39 shows that ion inertia reduces the LDI growth rate by no more than

14%, compared to Eq. (26), for  k < 0.5 and φ < 3.0.  This difference will be ignored here,

allowing for simple analytic comparison withγ

TPMI . Equate γ

TPMI , with ∆ω

TP  given by Eq.

(9), to γ

(also shown as the solid curve in Fig. 14).  Dashed curve is the loss of resonance

boundary.  The speed of sound has been assigned the value  ve 50.

However, if φ is above the dash-dot curve, then TPMI cannot occur.  The analysis of

TPMI breaks down near this curve:  as it is approached from below,  D⊥ ↓0, and

maximum growth rate occurs at larger and larger values of the perturbation wavenumber,

p, violating the assumed small p limit.

C. TPMI versus LDI damping thresholds

TPMI induced fluctuations have wavevectors close to k 0, while, in contrast, the LDI

daughter Langmuir wave tends to point40 in the direction opposite to k 0: the former may

have its damping rate directly reduced by electron trapping, while the latter does not41.

The combination of reduced damping and greater TPMI growth rate (see Fig.15), and the

modification of the LDI frequency/wavenumber matching conditions due to the trapped

particle frequency shift of the primary LW, is shown to lead to a rich structure of

competition between these instabilities, as  kλ

D  is varied.  As a prelude to the TPMI

threshold calculation, spatially uniform perturbations are analyzed.

1. Stability of damped/driven equilibria to spatially uniform perturbations

2. Stability against spatially varying fluctuations

If a fluctuation with wavevector p is allowed, it can be shown that the dispersion relation

is obtained from Eq. (36) by the substitution ∆ω→ ∆ω+ ˆ D p( ) .  Recall that  ˆ D p( )  is the

generalized dispersion given by Eq. (25).  As in the analysis of Eq. (21), the most

The 1 2  factor arises from the inverse dependence of γ

TP  on  φ.  If γ

TP  were φ

independent, then the threshold condition would have, instead, a factor of unity. In

general, the factor interpolates between these two limits, when the complete expression

for Imε is used.  For simplicity this distinction will be ignored for the purpose of

comparison with the LDI threshold, and the factor of  2  in Eq. (38) is ignored.  That

as the threshold amplitude decreases.  The wavenumber independence of this estimate is

due to the near balance between the increase of  ∆ω

D  and the increase of

Landau damping.

3. Reduction of LDI threshold by primary LW trapped particle frequency shift

have wavenumber k (p).  At the threshold, based on the linear dispersion relation for the

primary and daughter waves, γ

with k and v again related by the linear dispersion relation. The magnitude of

k*λ

D

= 2cs 3v e  is determined by the frequency of the daughter ion acoustic frequency.

The occurrence of the  k − k* argument of Landau damping, in lieu of k, is significant only

5/4/04                                                           32                                                      H. A. Rose

when Landau damping varies substantially over the range  k − k* to k. For example, if

k*λ

D

= 0.01 then ν

(

) ν

(
L 0.29

) ≈ 1.3, but ν

(
L 0.21

) ν

(
L 0.20

) ≈ 2.7.

Of possibly greater importance than the ion acoustic frequency induced wavenumber

shift, is the change in the LDI wavenumber/frequency matching condition due to the

primary LW trapped particle frequency shift.  When this is taken into account,

wavenumber and frequency matching imply

the daughter LW Landau damping has the value 0.01ω

that on this axis, φ = 0, and so the daughter wave is at  pλ

≈ 0.34 , where the two curves meet.  For greater values of ν, TPMI is not possible

because of the decrease of diffraction coefficients, eventually becoming negative, with

increasing φ.

D. Langmuir wave self-focusing estimates and implications for an actual

experimental beam

In Ref. [9], backscatter SRS and its daughter LW are observed in a large aspect ratio,

near diffraction limited laser beam, propagating in the “z” direction, in a very

homogeneous background plasma.  The most basic estimate as to the relevance of

possible electron trapping effects relates to the validity of the strongly trapped condition,

ν ω
b

<< 1, namely that an electron oscillates many times in the LW before escaping.

Based on measured reflectivity values, and experimental parameters, it will be shown that

this inequality is easily satisfied.

1. Strong trapping made plausible

While there are various processes which may contribute to the rate of escape of trapped

electrons, ν, the only one considered here is electron advection across the LW diameter,

5/4/04                                                           38                                                      H. A. Rose

assumed comparable to the beam waist (beam diameter at best focus),  ≈ Fλ

0 , where F is

the optic f/#, and  λ

0  the laser wavelength.  Dimensional analysis then leads to

ν = A v e Fλ

0 .  If the coefficient, A, is set to unity, then

2πF ν ω

p

(

) n c ne

.

Nominal experimental parameters (Te

= 500eV,  F = 4.5, nc ne

= 25) then imply

ν ω
p

≈ 0.005.

One estimate of the electron bounce frequency is obtained by first omitting diffraction

from SRS dynamics43, to obtain, at low density,

dESRS dt < k 2vosc

φ 4 .

This is in the frame of reference moving at the scattered light group velocity,  ≈ c , the

speed of light.  ESRS ( E0 ) is the scattered (laser) light temporal and spatial envelope.  vosc

is the electron oscillating speed in  E0  so that  ESRS v osc

∝ R , with R the SRS

reflectivity.  The inequality sign is introduced because this result will now be used to

estimate magnitudes and because omitted diffraction tends to weaken SRS spatial gain.

Estimate  t = L c , where L is the plasma length over which  ESRS  is near its peak value,

assumed large compared to its value at the far end of the speckle44.  It follows that

that

= 0.3, then this

D

bounce frequency estimate implies that eφ Te

> 0.025 , the experimentally estimated

lower bound9.

2. Instability transition and co-existence

A qualitative estimate of the wavenumber interval in which the TPMI and LDI thresholds

cross may be obtained, somewhat arbitrarily, by insisting that ν is no smaller than, e.g.,

1/5 of the nominal value given by Eq. (46), 0.001ω

p .  For this value of ν it can be shown

that the thresholds cross at  kλ

≈ 0.275 , while at the largest value ν can attain and still

D

allow TPMI, 0.005ω

p , the thresholds cross at  kλ

D

≈ 0.34  for ν

= 0.1.

ia

Even though thresholds may cross at a particular k, it does not follow that there is an

associated gradual transition from LDI to TPMI activity in a particular experiment.

There may be an instability gap.  For example, if the largest value attained by eφ Te  is

0.3, then in the range 0.29 < kλ

< 0.32 , both LDI and TPMI are below threshold for

D

ν ω
p

= 0.003 and ν

= 0.1.

ia

It is also possible that the two instabilities may co-exist in the same region of space if the

primary LW amplitude is above the LDI threshold and below the TPMI threshold.  Let

LDI be strong enough so that a second cascade step occurs.  The third daughter LW’s

(counting the primary as first) phase velocity is typically well within a trapping width of

5/4/04                                                           40                                                      H. A. Rose

TP  is small compared to ω

attain scales much smaller than determined by the spectral width of unstable modes, as

given by Eq. (49).   This implies that the angular width of TPMI excited Langmuir

Since backscattered light that couples to obliquely propagating LWs will rapidly diffract

out of the laser beam, most TPMI daughter LWs will not be amplified by the basic SRS

process.  Instead they play the role of an energy sink and hence a saturation mechanism

for SRS.

IV. DISCUSSION

Three simple estimates were presented, as to the importance of the Langmuir wave (LW)

trapped particle frequency shift, ∆ω

< 0 , for stability.  The first compares ∆ω

TP

TP  with

the ponderomotive force induced shift (Fig. 6).  This only involves the wave’s

normalized amplitude, eφ Te  and wavenumber,  kλ

D .  The second compares the trapped

particle modulational instability (TPMI) growth rate, γ

TPMI , with that of the Langmuir

wave ion acoustic decay instability, LDI, (Fig. 15).  This requires another parameter,

cs v e , the ratio of ion acoustic to electron thermal speeds.  The third compares the TPMI

and LDI amplitude thresholds (Fig. 22), which in addition depends upon the normalized

rate of escape of trapped electrons, ν ω

, and the ion acoustic damping coefficient, ν

p

ia .

These comparisons all suggest regime change at  kλ

≈ 0.3 due to the rapid increase of

D

∆ω

TP  (Fig. 5) with increasing  kλ

D .  There is an intermediate wavenumber regime, e.g.,

for small amplitude waves 0.33 < kλ

< 0.46, in which TPMI cannot be three-

D

dimensional since fluctuations purely along the wave direction (z) have negative

dispersion and hence are stable.  The nonlinear saturation of TPMI will then consist of

5/4/04                                                           42                                                      H. A. Rose

elongated structures in the z direction.  The x-y extent is estimated as small compared to

the experimental9 beam width.  One-dimensional models are TPMI stable in this regime.

Nonlinear dispersion, another aspect of ∆ω

TP , becomes significant as ν ω

p and  the

threshold value of eφ Te

 increase: dispersion decreases, until TPMI is not possible for

ν ω
  
p

> 0.005.  The positive dispersion amplitude boundary is lower than the loss of

resonance boundary (Fig. 15), and thus determines the TPMI damping limit (Fig. 22).

Assumptions have been made concerning slow variation so that the modulational model,

Eq. (14), is valid.  Slow variation in time requires that the TPMI growth time is large

compared to a bounce period, 2π ∆ω

b .  This is easily satisfied since even at  kλ

D

= 0.45,

∆ω

TP  is only a fraction of ω

b , and at most, γ

TPMI

= ∆ω

TP 4 .  Slow space variation

requires that the wavevector of the most unstable fluctuation, p, is small enough so that

the diffractive approximation, Eq. (20), to full dispersion, Eq. (25), is accurate.

Physically, this may be too small to be useful when  kλ

≈ 0.33, the point where the z

D

dispersion coefficient changes sign for small values of eφ Te .  On the other hand, TPMI

relevant values of eφ Te

 may lower this z diffractive transition point (Fig. 12) far enough

below wavenumbers of interest so that the diffractive model is valid, albeit with

amplitude dependent coefficients (Figs. 12 and 13).

The modulational model may be challenged by rapid spatial variation due to the

nonlinear LW response itself.  For example, even if the source, φ

0 , varies slowly in

space, there is a jump in nonlinear response at the response threshold, as shown in Fig.

5/4/04                                                           43                                                      H. A. Rose

16.  In space, there will be a transition from the large amplitude resonant response

ω
regime, with weak Landau damping and large   

b, to a small amplitude, non-resonant

response regime, with strong Landau damping and small ω

b. The assumed local relation

ω
between Ξ and φ, Eqs. (4) and (5), will break if   
b

< v p

∂ ∂z ln φ , with   

v p  the LW phase

velocity.  A simple transport model for Ξ, with advection velocity   

v p , and relaxation to

Eqs. (4) and (5) at rate ω

b, has revealed qualitative changes in behavior when applied to

backward SRS modeling due to this effect47.  Note, however, that even in the strongly

ω
trapped and 
  
b

> v p

∂ ∂z ln φ  regime, the response of φ as given by Eq. (15)

(supplemented by source and nonlinear damping as in Eq. (28)) may be quite different

from the local equilibrium solution, Eq. (13), and in this sense non-adiabatic.  All that is

required is that φ

0 ’s time variation is fast compared to ∆ω

TP .  Since there is typically a

large gap between ∆ω

ω
TP  and   

b (see Fig. 5), the LW response may simultaneously be

non-adiabatic and still accurately given by the modulational model.

Comparison of LDI and TPMI thresholds requires a re-evaluation of the LDI threshold

due to the primary LW’s trapped particle frequency shift.  If this effect were ignored,

then LDI (with ν

= 0.1) would require a non-resonant primary LW with

ia

eφ Te

= O 1( ) when  kλ

D

> 0.36.  Instead, the LDI threshold may be dramatically lowered

(Fig. 21), making for more interesting competition with TPMI.

Of course, one need not invoke competition with TPMI to explain the experimentally

observed9 regime change, whose principle qualitative feature is the change from a

5/4/04                                                           44                                                      H. A. Rose

coherent, LDI-like LW spectrum, to an incoherent spectrum, at  kλ

≈ 0.32 .  For

D

example, as an alternative mechanism, the SRS daughter Langmuir wave may simply fall

below the LDI threshold as  kλ

D  increases.

(
Since ν∝1 beam diameter

approximately controlled by  ν ω

(

p

ia , a TPMI significant reduction of ν is

achievable by doubling the optic f/#.  For example, if ν ω

p  were reduced from 0.004 to

0.002 (see Fig. 22), the LDI/TPMI crossover is lowered to  kλ

≈ 0.30 from  kλ

≈ 0.33.

D

D

If such a decrease in  kλ

D  at loss of LDI were seen experimentally, this would be one vote

in favor of competition with TPMI as the operative mechanism since the value of ν has

no effect on the linear LDI threshold.

Quantitative estimates of ν may remain elusive, as it pertains to SRS modeling, since its

value must depend on details of the daughter Langmuir wave geometry, and that

geometry is quite variable.  For example, if the SRS spatial gain rate is large enough, the

LW width can be smaller than that of the laser beam due to gain localization.  Even if this

is not the case, in a spatially incoherent laser beam the regions of large intensity

fluctuations (speckles) where SRS thrives, are only approximately diffraction limited, and

other processes such as forward stimulated Brillouin scatter may change the speckle

length (and width) with beam propagation48, implying significant uncertainty in the basic

LW geometry.  However, for given LW geometry, the value of ν has significance beyond

that as a parameter in a 1D modified Vlasov equation: if the extrapolation of the LW

TPMI threshold. In the context of the current 1D model, that residual is determined by

the free parameter ν, and the function ∆, as in Eq. (5).

24 Because of ion inertia, the actual ponderomotive induced shift tends to be smaller.

otherwise trapped electron is lost by diffusion in a time < 1 ω

here is for the case of a coherent wave.

26 The expression for Re Ξ, however, as given by Eq. (4), may be valid for φ larger than

its loss of resonance value for a particular value of k, because the definition and

evaluation of Ξ does not require a plasma resonance.

32  B. I. Cohen and A. N. Kaufman, Phys. Fluids 21, 404 (1978).  There is an enormous

literature on the derivation of nonlinear wave equations, going back at least to the

seminal work of G.  B. Whitham, Proc. Roy. Soc (London A283, 238 (1965)), which uses

a  Lagrangian  based, variational  approach.  The point of view taken by Cohen and

Kaufman, and this work, (dissipation and a source are explicitly allowed in section

III.C.1), is that the wave is supported by a finite  amplitude source, which is balanced by

dissipation.  The equilibrium , harmonic approximation, response to a monochromatic

source is determined by the nonlinear dielectric function, ε, and thus its Taylor series

naturally describes slow modulations about such an equilibrium.

40 Any direction for the LDI daughter wave, in principle, can support the instability,

though absent strong damping anisotropy, backscatter is favored over sidescatter, both

because the intrinsic growth rate is a maximum in the former and because of the highly

elongated geometry of the laser beam used in experiment9.  While this needs to be re-

examined, in view of anisotropic trapped particle effects, since experimental data9 is in

quantitative agreement with LDI backscatter, this is the point of view adopted here.

41 These considerations strictly apply near threshold.  If the LDI daughter wave attains

finite amplitude, its damping may decrease.

42 For example, see Fig. 9 of Ref. 10.

44 If the average laser intensity,  I , is above its critical value for SRS, then the power

gain over a speckle length is at least as large as the ratio of a particular speckle’s intensity

to   I  (see H. A. Rose and D. F. DuBois, Phys. Rev Lett. 72, 2883 (1994)).  Since the

most probable speckle intensity (absent self-focusing) is about 3  I  (see J. Garnier, Phys.

Plasmas 6, 1601 (1999)), this condition is then easily satisfied.

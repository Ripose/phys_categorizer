Abstract 

Component  of  the  instantaneous  ionization  rate  (IIR)  is  introduced  and  calculated  for  H2

+  in  a 

linearly  polarized  laser  field  with  1.0×1014 W/cm2  intensity  and  λ = 1064 nm  wavelength  by 

direct  solution  of  the  fixed-nuclei  full  dimensional  time-dependent  Schrödinger  equation.  The 

component  ionization  rates,  calculated  for  different  values  of  inter-nuclear  distance,  are 

compared  with  those  calculated  via  the  virtual  detector  method  (VD).  Details  of  the  time 

dependent  behavior  of  the  outgoing  and  incoming  electron  wavepakets  of  the  H2

+  system  in 

intense  laser  field  at  attosecond  time  scale  are  studied  based  on  the  calculated  component 

ionization rates. It has been shown clearly that the positive signals of the IIR (outgoing electron 

wavepacket signals) are strong and sharp but the negative signals of the IIR (returning electron 

wavepacket signals) are smooth and weak. It is also shown that for H-H distance R<5.6, when 

the laser pulse is turned on with a ramp, the R-dependent ionization rates move towards those of 

the upper time dependent Floquet quasi-energy state (QES).

Introduction 

In  intense  laser  field,  atoms  and  molecules  are  ionized  in  the  attosecond  scale  [1].  In 

addition to the electronic dynamics, molecules have nuclear dynamics, vibration and rotation, in 

femtosecond  and  picosecond  time  scales.  Extensive  studies  carried  out  experimentally  and 

theoretically  on  the  H2  and  H2

+  systems  have  revealed  comprehensive  new  phenomena  [2-4]. 

Studies of the dynamics of these two systems exposed to intense laser field are very complicated 

because involved simultaneously two processes, ionization and dissociation. 

An  interesting  and  complicated  effect  observed  experimentally  and  theoretically  is  the 

enhancement  of  the  ionization  rate  of  H2

+  as  a  function  of  H-H  inter-nuclear  separation  which 

results  in  maxima  at  some  critical  points.  Indirect  [5,  6]  and  direct  [7]  evidences  have  been 

reported for a similar behavior in more complex molecules. In order to characterize and interpret 

the  observed  enhanced  ionization  rates  [8-13],  recent  theoretical  studies  on  the  H2

+–laser 

interaction have been concentrated on the calculation of the ionization rate as a function of inter-

nuclear  distance  R  [14-28].  The  enhanced  ionization  has  a  very  important  role  in  the 

interpretation of the intra-molecular dynamics and fragmentation in intense laser field [24]. 

Recently, calculations of the ionization rates have had very important improvements. For 

the  Ti:sapphire  laser  at  intensities  starting  from  just  above  the  Coulomb  explosion  (CE) 

threshold, it is shown that the R-dependent ionization peaks moves towards small inter-nuclear 

distances, and their structures become simpler and smoother with the increase in the intensity of 

the laser pulse (i.e. with the decrease in the Keldysh parameter) [22]. The virtual detector method 

made  it  possible  to  define  and  distinguish  ionization  rates  and  outgoing  norms  from  different 

boundaries  which  can  be  used  to  study  details  of  the  dynamics  of  the  spatial  evolution  of  the 

electron wavefunction [18]. Moreover, based on the instantaneous ionization rates (IIR), details 

 

2

of  the time-dependent behavior of the system following the variations of the laser field can be 

extracted  and  used  in  the  interpretation  of  the  enhanced  ionization  rates  [28].  This  approach 

allows us to determine not only the instantaneous intensity but also the instantaneous direction of 

the electronic current. This approach provides direct evidence for the existence of the effect of 

charge-resonance-enhanced multiphoton resonances of the quasienergy states (QES) with excited 

electronic states at some particular internuclear distances [19,28]. 

In this article, we present more details about the structure of the enhanced ionization rate of 

H2

+ as a function of inter-nuclear separation by calculating and analyzing overall and component 

IIR  and  the time-averaged overall  ionization rates  for different values of  the  rising  time  of the 

intense laser pulse. In the rest of this article, the numerical method used for the modeling of the 

H2

+  system  is  introduced  briefly  and  then  the  results  obtained  for  the  λ = 1064 nm  and 

1.0×1014 W/cm2  laser  light  are  presented.  Next,  the  components  of  the  IIR  are  introduced  and 

their results are presented and discussed.

by  direct  solution  of  the  TDSE  in  the  presence  of  the  linearly  polarized  laser  field  with 

I=1.0×1014 W/cm2  and  λ = 1064 nm  has  been  reported  in  our  previous  report  [28].  In  this 

simulation,  parameters  of  the  pulse  envelope  are  set  to 

1 =τ

5

  and 

2 =τ

51

.  The  overall 

ionization  rate  of  H2

+  at  each  inter-nuclear  distance  is  calculated  by  averaging  the  calculated 

instantaneous ionization rates over the period 

10=τ

 to 

20=τ

 cycles of the laser field using Eq. 

(5).  Figure  1  shows  the  R-dependent  ionization  rates  calculated  for  the  H2

+  system  (●).  In 

addition to the results reported in our previous paper [28], this figure contains a new set of points 

at large values of R, above 14.0. The isolated single point on the right vertical axis corresponding 

to the ionization rate of an isolated H atom in the same laser field is given for comparison. Figure 

1  shows  that  at  large  internuclear  distances,  the  ionization  rates  of  H2

+  approache  those  of  the 

isolated H atom. As discussed in [28], the calculated ionization rates, especially above R>9.5, are 

in good  agreement  with  those  reported by others  [16,17,19].  It  can  also  be seen  from  Figure 1 

that the R-Г curve below R=6.5 has a fine structure with both narrow and weak peaks.  

 

We have  shown  already  [18]  that  in  a  cylindrical  coordinate,  it is possible  to decompose 

the  outgoing  norm  of  the  system  as

ionization rate  VDΓ  and its  z  and  ρ component,

method, are connected via [18]

This  means  that  the  total  VD  ionization  rate 

VDΓ   is  approximately  equal  to  the  sum  of  the 

component ionization rates for the  z  and  ρ boundaries 

zΓ  and  ρΓ , both calculated via the VD

method.  Figure  2  shows  the  total  VD  ionization  rate, 

VDΓ (●),  and  its  components, 

zΓ (Δ)  and 

ρΓ (□)  as  functions  of  internuclear  separation  R  calculated  for  H2

+  in  intense  laser  field  of 

I=1.0×1014 W/cm2 and λ = 1064 nm in a simulation box of (640,170).  

Comparison of Figure 2 and Figure 4a of Ref. [18] shows the wavelength effects of the intense 

laser field on the total VD ionization rate 

VDΓ  and its components ionization rates 

zΓ  and  ρΓ . 

Variations of the component ionization rates are decreased with the increase in the wavelength 

from 790 nm to 1064 nm.  

We can see from Figure 2 that the first peak of the ionization rate at R~4.8 is mainly due to the 

ionization rate of the z-coordinate 

zΓ , while the second and the third peak, at 6.0 and 9.4, have 

contributions from both component ionization rates 

zΓ and  ρΓ ; comparative contributions of the 

component  ionization  rates  for  the  two  peaks  are  respectively 

ρΓ>Γz

  and 

zΓ>Γρ

.  In  this 

simulation  box,  for  internuclear  distances  above  R=13.0,  the  two  component  ionization  rates 

approach  one  another.  As  shown  in  our  recent  study  [18],  the  relative  magnitudes  of  the 

component  ionization  rates 

zΓ and  ρΓ   depend  also  on  the  relative  sizes  of  the  simulation  box 

along the ρ and  z  coordinates.

This  equation  shows  that  the  overall  IIR, 

)(tΓ ,  can  be  decomposed  into  its  two  z   and  ρ  IIR 

components, 

)(tzΓ

 and 

)(tρΓ

, in the same way as the total VD ionization rate [18]. 

The  IIR  and  its  components  for  H2

+  at  some  fixed  inter-nuclear  separations  have  been 

calculated by direct solution of the TDSE in the presence of the linearly polarized laser field with 

I=1.0×1014 W/cm2 intensity and  λ = 1064 nm wavelength with the envelope parameters 

1 =τ

5

 

and 

2 =τ

51

.  The  overall  ionization  rate  of  H2

+  at  each  inter-nuclear  distance  is  calculated  by 

averaging the calculated IIR over the period 

10=τ

 to 

20=τ

. Figure 3 shows the R-dependent 

overall  ionization  rate  Γ (●)  and  its  components, 

zΓ (Δ)  and  ρΓ (□),  calculated  in  the  present 

study  for  the  H2

+  system.  Structures  of  these  R-dependent  curves  are  similar  to  those  of  the 

corresponding curves in Figure 2. While additivity of the VD ionization rate components 

zΓ  and 

ρΓ , and thus the equality of Eq. (6), is an approximation, the relation between the instantaneous 

ionization rate 

)(tΓ  and its two component 

)(tzΓ

 and 

)(tρΓ

 in Eq. (8) is exact. 

 

On  the basis  of  Eqs.  (7)  and  (8),  for 

)(tΓ   and  its  components 

)(tzΓ

  and 

)(tρΓ

,  positive 

(negative)  values  of  instantaneous  imaginary  energy  result  in  negative  (positive)  value  for 

instantaneous ionization rates, and therefore, the positive (negative) values of the instantaneous 

 

 

 

7

imaginary  energy  correspond  to  the  incoming  (outgoing)  of  the  electron  to  (from)  the  system 

[28]. 

The distinct advantage of the evaluation of the IIR via Eqs. (7) and (8) is that it makes it 

possible to follow the time-dependent ionization processes of a system and to study details of the 

ionization  mechanism  [28].  To  show  this  ability  more  clearly,  the  time-dependent  ionization 

rates  of  H2

+  in  the  linearly  polarized  field  of  I= 1.0×1014 W/cm2  intensity  and  λ = 1064 nm 

wavelength  for  a  number  of  selected  inter-nuclear  separations  have  been  calculated  and 

presented  in  Figure  4.  The  R  values  in  Figure  4  correspond  to  the  peaks  of  the  R-dependent 

ionization  rates  presented  in  Figure  1,  i.e.  4.8,  6.0  and  9.6.  These  Figures  demonstrate  the 

behavior of the IIR and its components over the two cycles (from 

14=τ

 to 

61=τ

) of the laser 

pulse ( 1 cycle ~ 3.55 fs). 

 

Analysis  of  Figure  4  reveals  that  the  overall  pattern  and  structure  of  the  IIR 

)(tΓ   is 

dominantly determined by the  z  component IIR, 

. Figure 4 shows also that during a cycle, 

)(tzΓ

the 

)(tzΓ

 curves strongly fluctuate besides having a baseline consisting of an ordered oscillation 

with  the  same  frequency  as  that  of  the  laser  field.  Therefore,  the  sharp  peaks  of 

)(tΓ   can 

primarily be attributed to the variation of 

)(tzΓ

. In contrast to the variation of 

)(tzΓ

, variation of 

)(tρΓ

 has a considerably smaller amplitude. Comparison between the two component ionization 

curves shows that variation of the outflow of electron from the  ρ boundary is relatively much 

smoother than that from the  z  boundary. Each base line peak of the 

)(tzΓ

 IIR corresponds to 

one  cycle  of  the  laser  pulse.  The 

  IIR  curves  does  not  show  any  significant  oscillating 

)(tρΓ

structure,  but  have  distinct  smooth  peaks  for  every  half  cycle  of  the  laser  pulse.  A  general 

character of the baseline peaks of the 

)(tρΓ

 is that (unlike those of the 

)(tzΓ

) they do not fall to 

 

8

zero suddenly. Furthermore, the baseline peaks of the 

 have significant intensity at R=9.4. 

)(tρΓ

Figure  4  shows  clearly  the  details  of  the  comparative  trends  of  the  two  component  IIRs 

demonstrated in Figure 3 and discussed above. 

Comparison  between  the  results  obtained  by  TDSE  and  time-dependent  Floquet 

quasienergy approaches 

We  recently  reported  details  of  the  enhanced  ionization  rates  based  on  the  IIR  [28].  This 

approach gives direct evidence of the charge-resonance-enhanced multiphoton resonances of the 

quasienergy states (QES) with excited electronic states at some particular internuclear distances. 

Here in this article, we present more details of the contributions of the individual time dependent 

Floquet QES to the overall ionization rates.  

Chu  and  Chu  tried  to  resolve  detailed  mechanism  of  the  ionization  enhancement 

phenomenon  by  calculating  ionization  rates  of  the  QESs  [19].  They  applied  an  ac  Floquet 

calculation  to  study  characteristics  and  the  dynamic  behavior  of  the  complex  QESs  of  H2

+  at 

different  values  of  internuclear  distance  R.  They  introduced  a  complex-scaling  generalized 

pseudo  spectral  (CSGPS)  technique  for  the determination of  the  complex  QESs  for  two-center 

diatomic  molecular  systems.  Chu  and  Chu’s  calculations  showed  that  the  dominant  electron 

population  remains  in  the 

gσ1

  and 

uσ1

  states  in  the  laser  field  of  1×1014W/cm2  intensity  and 

λ = 1064 nm wavelength. Thus, the two distinctly different groups of QESs, i.e. the lower and 

upper groups, whose major components are the field-free 

gσ1

 and 

uσ1

, can be derived. Because 

of the Floquet symmetry, all of the QESs in the lower (or in the upper) group separated by  ω2  (n 

is an integer) in energy, are in fact physically indistinguishable and contain the same information 

 

 

9

regarding  multiphoton  dynamics.  Thus,  all  QESs  in  the  lower  (or  in  the  upper)  group  have 

identical imaginary energies. They used the dynamical properties of these two sets of QESs to 

explore  the  mechanism(s)  responsible  for  the  enhanced  ionization  phenomenon.  A  detailed 

analysis of the nature and dynamical behavior of these QESs by Chu and Chu [19] reveals that 

the  ionization  enhancement  is  mainly  due  to  the  effect  of  the  charge-resonance-enhanced 

multiphoton  resonances  of  the 

gσ1

  and 

uσ1

  states  with  the  excited  electronic  states  at  some 

particular  inter-nuclear  distances.  Chu  and  Chu  results,  presented  in  Figure  5,  indicate  that  the 

QESs in the lower and upper groups both show a double-peak enhancement feature. 

To evaluate individual contributions from the lower and upper sets of QESs to the overall 

ionization rates, we have reported in Figure 5 the calculated overall ionization rates for different 

laser  pulses  with  different  values  of  rising  time 

1τ ,  and  compared  them  with  the  isolated 

ionization rates of these two QESs reported by Chu and Chu [19]. As this figure shows, when the 

field is turned on with 

1 =τ

5

 cycles (○), the ionization rates show three peaks, at 4.8, 6.0 and 

~9.6. The peaks at 6.0 and 9.6 can be attributed to the peaks of the lower QES. But the first peak 

at 4.8 is placed between the peaks of the lower and upper QES. When the laser pulse is turned on 

immediately, i.e. with 

1 =τ

0

, the calculated ionization rates derived by TDSE (●) correspond to 

those  of  the  lower  QES  for 

8.4R >

.  Figure  5  shows  that  the  TDSE  results  for 

8.4R <

  with 

1 =τ

0

  (●),  take  a  slight  distance  from  the  lower  QES  Floquet  curve.  This  small  difference  is 

probably due to the avoided crossing of the upper and lower QES’s. On the other hand, when the 

laser  pulse  is  turned  on  with  a  ramp  or  rising  part  with  increasing 

1τ   from  zero  to 

1 =τ

5

(○), 

1 =τ

10

  (Δ)  and 

1 =τ

15

  (□)  cycles  for  example,  the  points  of  the  ionization  rates  for 

6.5R <

 

approach the curve of the upper QES. We can conclude that when the laser pulse is turned on 

with  an  initial  ramp,  both  lower  and  upper  QES’s  contribute  to  construct  the  first  peak  of  the 

 

10

ionization  rates  at  R=4.8.  For  all  of  the 

R <

3.6

  and 

R >

5.2

  ranges,  the  ionization  rates  are 

determined by the lower QES and the amount of 

1τ  does not have significant effect on the R-

dependent ionization rate. 

Instantaneous returning of the electron wavepacket 

As  mentioned  in  the  preceding  section,  positive  (negative)  value  of  the  instantaneous 

imaginary  energy  results  in  negative  (positive)  value  for  IIR,  and  therefore,  the  positive 

(negative) value of the instantaneous imaginary energy corresponds to the incoming (outgoing) 

of the electron to (from) the system. Designing a simulation to show both negative and positive 

IIR  is  a  difficult  task,  because  the  outgoing  and  incoming  electron  wavepakets  occur 

simultaneously and are summed to give the overall IIR. Moreover, the intensity of the positive 

IIR  overcomes  that  of  the  negative  IIR  almost  usually.  Therefore,  it  seems  that  it  is 

experimentally impossible to probe the negative IIR. So far, the negative ionization rate has not 

been  reported  or  noticed  in  theoretical  and  computational  works.  In  this  section,  we  introduce 

details  and  structures  of  both  negative  and  positive  IIR  and  their  contributions  to  the 

corresponding  component  and  overall  IIRs  and  their  averages,  and  their  effect  on  the  R-

the present calculations of the IIRs, different simulation boxes are used with different positions 

of  the  borders  of  the  gray  region  which  are  set  respectively  at  (a)

  for  the  ρ 

coordinate. The two red bullets near the origin are the H nuclei having a 9.6 distance. Figure 7 

demonstrates the calculated IIR’s and their components corresponding to the simulation boxes of 

Figure 6. 

Let us now study the IIR for the first simulation box (shown in Figure 6a). When the laser 

field  is  turned  on,  the  electron  wavepacket  starts  to  outgo  from  the  gray  region  by  passing 

through the  z  borders placed at -50 and 50 and through the  ρ border placed at 150. Since the  z  

borders are closer to the concentrated part (center) of the unperturbed (t=0) electron wavepacket, 

we thus expect to detect first the outgoing wavepacket from the  z  borders much earlier than that 

from the  ρ border. If one of the borders of the gray region is placed closer to (farther from) the 

nuclei (i.e. the center of the unperturbed wavepacket), intensity of the outgoing wavepacket from 

that border in the initial stages of the laser pulse becomes also stronger (weaker). Therefore, the 

outgoing  electron wavepacket  from  the  z  borders in  Figure 6a  is  expected  to be  stronger  than 

that  from  the  ρ  border.  The  IIRs  demonstrated  in  Figure  7a  are  in  agreement  with  this 

expectation. For each cycle of the laser pulse, there should be two distinct stages in the outgoing 

wavepacket that passes alternatively from the two  z  borders, located respectively in the 

z+  and 

z−   directions.  This  is  while  the  outgoing  wavepacket  from  the  ρ  border  should  be  smooth, 

however still periodic (due to the periodic behavior of the pulse), with weak variations. 

 

12

Figure 7a shows one baseline peak for the overall IIR and its  z  component for every half 

cycle  of  the  laser  pulse  related  to  the  passage  of  the  electron  wavepacket  through  the 

corresponding 

z+   or 

z−   borders.  Intensity  of  this  baseline  peak  reaches  its  maximum  value 

over the first few cycles of the laser pulse. The first baseline peak is relatively weak. As can be 

seen from Figure 7a, the  ρ component of the IIR for the Figure 6a setup of the simulation box 

shows  always  very  weak  variations  and  does  not  distinctly  follow  up  the  laser  pulse  shape. 

Outgoing electron from the  z  borders is strong as compared to that from the  ρ border, which is 

weak. In this case, the total ionization rate can be considered to be mainly due to the ionization 

through the  −z borders. 

The 

z+   and 

z− borders  in  Figure  6b  are  placed  at  +50  and  -150,  respectively.  This 

situation of the  −z borders results in two effects. First, the 

z−  component IIR will be vanished 

for  some  initial  half  cycles  of  the  laser  pulse  due  to  the  longer  time  needed  for  the  electron 

wavepackets to reach the 

z−  border than to reach the 

z+  border. Second, the intensity of the  z  

component  IIR  corresponding  to  the  outflow  of  electron  from  the 

z+   border  at  +50  is  very 

stronger than that of the 

z−  border at -150 which is due to the fact that the 

z+  border is closer 

to  the  center  of  the  initial  wavepacket.  These  two  effects  result  in  the baseline  peaks  of  the  z  

component IIR with alternative intensities; the alternate strong positive  peaks corresponding to 

the  half  cycles  in  which  the  outflow  is  towards  the 

z+ direction  and  the  alternative  negative 

weak peaks corresponding to the half-cycles in which the outflow is towards the 

z−  direction. A 

comparison between Figures 7a and 7b shows that the outgoing electron from the 

z+  border at 

+50 overcomes the incoming electron from the 

z−  border at -150 when the electric field is in 

the 

z+   direction,  but  the  outgoing  electron  from  the 

z−   border  at  -150  cannot  overcome  the 

incoming  electron  from  the 

z+   border  at  +50  when  the  electric  field  is  in  the 

z−   direction. 

 

13

Therefore, the negative and positive IIR peaks alternatively appear along each other in Figure 7b. 

It  is  only  with  this  design  of  the  simulation  box,  Figure  6b,  that  we  can  clearly  observe  the 

negative  IIR.  Figure  7b  exhibits  that  the  positive  signals  of  the  IIR  (outgoing  electron 

wavepacket signals) are strong and sharp but the negative signals of the IIR (returning electron 

wavepacket signals) are smooth and weak. 

As  the  borders  are  moved  sufficiently  farther  away  from  the  nuclei  (as  in  Figure  6c), 

intensity of the both positive and negative signals of the IIR become weaker at earlier time stages 

of  the  laser  pulse,  and  probability  of  the  returning  electron  wavepacket  (the  negative  IIR) 

becomes smaller, Figure 7c. Comparison of Figures 7b and 7c shows that the negative IIR peaks 

are almost vanished for the simulation box of Figure 6c; only positive IIR peaks appear in Figure 

7c. In addition, the positive peaks corresponding to the 

z+  border become weaker in Figure 7c 

as compared to those in Figure 7b. In Figure 7c, when the electric laser field is in the 

z+  (

z− ) 

direction,  the  outgoing  electron  from  the 

z+   (

z− )  border  overcomes  the  incoming  electron 

from the 

z−  (

z+ ) border. This, therefore, results in the IIR signals which are always positive. 

To  study  the  effect  of  the  region  boundary  on  the  IIR  signals  and  its  components,  we 

carried out two other sets of calculations based on the simulation boxes demonstrated in Figures 

6d and 6e which result are presented in Figures 7d and 7e, respectively. Comparison of Figures 

7d and 7e with Figure 7c shows that for the present setup of the simulation box, positions of the 

box boundaries have insignificant effect on the IIR signals. The difference between Figures 7c, 

7d and 7e can be interpreted based on the position of the boundaries according to the discussions 

presented above, i.e. the closer the borders to the  center of the initial wavepacket, the  stronger 

the corresponding component IIR peaks. It is thus shown here that calculation of the IIR and its 

component is easily possible for any local area. 

 

14

Figure  7  shows  that  the  structure  of  the  IIR  peaks  is  determined  mainly  by  its  z  

component,  and  that  the  ρ  IIR  component  has  smooth  structure.  Furthermore,  relative 

magnitudes of the IIR components depend strongly on the relative positions of the corresponding 

borders with respect to the center of the initial wavepacket. 

 

Conclusion 

We introduced and calculated exact component instantaneous ionization rates (IIR) based 

on  the  instantaneous  values  of  imaginary  energy.  It  is  also  possible  to  calculate  IIR  via  the 

calculation of instantaneous imaginary energy or instantaneous norm of the system, but the exact 

evaluation  of  the  component  IIR  is  possible  only  with  the  calculation  of  component 

instantaneous  imaginary  energy.  It  is  shown  that  the  instantaneous  behavior  of  the  electron 

wavepacket in intense laser field can be probed closely using the IIR of the system. Moreover, 

details of  the  electron  wavepacket  evolution  in different  directions  of  the working space under 

the influence of the strong ultrashort laser field can be studied by calculating components of the 

IIR. Analyzing of the IIR signals and their components, allows probing details of the behavior of 

the  outgoing  and  incoming  electron  wavepackets  of  the  system  in  intense  laser  field  in 

attosecond time scale. In addition, it is also possible to follow the wavepackets in the atomic unit 

spacetime [29]. It is shown that the positive signals of the component and overall IIR (outgoing 

electron wavepacket signals) are strong and sharp but the negative signals of the component and 

overall IIR (returning electron wavepacket signals) are smooth and weak.  

We also showed in this report that the TDSE and ac Floquet calculations together form a 

powerful  tool  to  derive  detailed  mechanism  of  the  ionization  enhancement  phenomenon.  The 

comparison  between  the  results  obtained  by  these  two  methods  leads  us  to  determine  the 

 

15

individual contributions of the QESs to the overall ionization rates. It is revealed by the present 

results of the solution of TDSE that when the pulse of the laser field is turned on slowly (with a 

ramp), both lower and upper QES contribute to construct the first peak of the ionization rates at 

R=4.8  For  all  of  the 

R <

3.6

  and 

R >

5.2

  ranges,  the  ionization  rates  are  determined  by  the 

lower  QES,  and  the  duration  of  the  rising  time  of  the  laser  pulse,  i.e. 

1τ ,  does  not  have  any 

significant effect on the contribution of the two QES for the 

R <

3.6

 and 

R >

5.2

 ranges.

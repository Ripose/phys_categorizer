Physics Design Considerations of Diagnostic X Beam Transport System*

Yu-Jiuan Chen and Arthur C. Paul, LLNL, Livermore, CA 94550, USA

Abstract

Diagnostic X (D-X) transport system would extract the
beam from the  downstream  transport  line  of  the  second-
axis  of  the  Dual  Axis  Radiographic  Hydrodynamic  Test
facility (DARHT-II[1]) and transport this beam to the  D-X
firing point  via  four branches of  the  beamline in  order to
provide  four  lines  of  sight  for  x-ray  radiography.  The
design  goal  is  to  generate  four  DARHT-II-like  x-ray
pulses  on  each  line  of  sight.  In  this  paper,  we  discuss
several potential beam quality degradation processes in  the
passive  magnet  lattice  beamline  and  indicate  how  they
constrain the D-X beamline design parameters, such as  the
background pressure, the pipe size, and the pipe material.

1  INTRODUCTION

The D-X beamlines would transport several sections  of
the 20 MeV,  2  kA,  2  µs  long  beam from the  DARHT-II
accelerator  exit  to  the  D-X  firing  point  to  provide  four
lines  of  sight  for  x-ray  radiography.  The  DARHT-II-like
x-ray  pulses  will  be  generated  for  each  line  of  sight.
Therefore,  maintaining  the  beam  quality  in  the  D-X
system  is  essential.  Since  the  DARHT-II  accelerator
operates at 1 pulse per minute or less,  it  is  also  crucial to
design  the  D-X  beamline  configuration  requiring  a
minimum  number  of  tuning  shots.  Modification  to  the
DARHT-II building and the  downstream  transport  should
be minimized. Lastly, the D-X system should not  preclude
the future upgrade for additional lines of sight.

the  beamline  design.  We  establish 

In  this  report,  we  discuss  several  beam  degradation
processes  in  the  passive  beamline  (excluding  the  active
components  such  as  the  kicker  systems)  and  how  they
constrain 
the
specifications for beam emittance in  Sec.  2,  pipe  material
and size in Sec. 3, the  vacuum requirement in  Sec.  4.  We
discuss the emittance growth in  a bend and the  alignment
specifications  in  Secs.  5  and  6.  In  Secs.  7  and  8,  we
discuss  the  design  objectives  on  how  to  extract  beams
from the DARHT-II beamline and to  minimize  the  tuning
shots. A conclusion will be presented in Sec. 9.

2  EMITTANCE AND X-RAY DOSE

The internal divergence angle (θ = ε  /af

 )  of  the  beam
hitting  the  Bremsstrahlung  target  increase  the  radiation
cone angle,  and hence lower the  forward x-ray dose.  Here
ε  is the un-normalized Lapostolle emittance, and af is  the
beam radius on the target. The scaling law for the  forward
x-ray dose D created by  an electron current I with  a pulse
length τ
p hitting a 1-mm thick  tungsten  plate is  given  by
the functional form[2] of

3  CONDUCTIVITY AND PIPE SIZE

There are several transport issues regarding the choice of
beam  pipe  size  and  material,  especially,  conductivity  of
the pipe material. The finite conductivity of  the  pipe  wall
can cause both  transverse[3]  and  longitudinal[4]  resistive
wall instabilities and beam energy loss.

3.1  Transverse Resistive Wall Instability

The transverse resistive wall  instability  arises from the
diffusion  of  the  return  current  into  the  wall  due  to  its
finite  conductivity. The reduction  in  the  magnetic  forces
of the dissipating return current acts as frictional forces on
the particles. The friction forces enhance the slow  wave of
the  transverse beam  displacement  over  the  length  of  the
beam path and lead to beam loss  and large time  integrated
spot sizes on the targets.

For a continuous focusing system, the instability  grows

Comparing the equations above, we observe that  ltr  = (Ltr/

kβ )
soon,  using  a  large,  highly  conductive  beampipe,  and
transporting  beam  with  relatively  strong  focusing  fields
can reduce the instability growth.

Two  pipe  materials  are  examined  for  the  instability
growth: 304 stainless steel at 68 Fo, and 6061-TO Al  with
at  68  Fo.  Based on  the  growth lengths  given  in  Table  1,
we have chosen the beampipe to be 8 cm  radius, 6061-TO
Al.  Note that the beams in most of the  D-X beamline are
short pulses (~100  ns)  extending over 2  µs  instead of  the
full 2 µs  long  pulses,  and hence, the  true growth lengths
are expected to be longer than  those  in  Table 1.  We have
also  limited  the  maximum  length  for  each  beamline
branch to  200  m,  and that  for individual drift sections  to
10  m.  Since  the  nominal  D-X beam radius is  1  cm,  the
chance of  having  the  beam melt  the  Al  pipe  wall  should
be small.

Table 1 The resistive wall  instability’s  growth length  for
a 2 µs long D-X beam. The pipe radius is 8 cm.
Using a 13 cm radius stainless steel pipe  also  gives  the
same growth length. However, the transport system would
be 60  %  longer.  Furthermore,  the  accuracy  of  the  beam
position monitors needed for a larger pipe  would lead to  a
larger uncorrectable centroid displacement  which  provides
the free energy for emittance growth.

3.2  Parasitic Energy Loss

When  the  beam  is  traveling  down  a  pipe,  the  return
current  flows  in  the  resistive  pipe  wall  in  the  opposite
direction and creates a longitudinal voltage drop along  the
wall.  For  a  2  kA  beam  pulse  with  a  5  ns  rise  time
traveling for 100 m  in  a 8  cm  radius Al  pipe,  the  energy
loss at 50% of the peak current is  only  about  1  keV,  i.e.,
0.005 % of the beam energy.

3.3  Longitudinal Resistive Wall Instability
The ohmic losses  due to  the  image currents flowing  in
the  resistive  wall  coupled  with  perturbations  in 
the
current’s  line  density  lead  to  longitudinal  resistive  wall
instability.  Since  the  ohmic  losses  are negligible  for  the
D-X transport,  the  beam  needs  to  travel  a  long  distance
before  accumulating  enough  perturbation  in 
the  line
density  from  bunching  or  debunching.  Therefore,  the
longitudinal  resistive  wall 
instability  should  not  a
concern. Without any Landau damping, the  growth length
is 98 km for the instability  at  1  GHz and 219  km  for the
instability at 200 MHz.

4  VACUUM REQUIREMENT

Collisional ionization of the background gas  may  affect
the  beam  propagation  in  a  substantial  way.  Secondary
electrons created in  the  collisions  can be  expelled  by  the
beam electrons’ space charge fields, while  the  ions  remain
trapped in  the  potential  well  of  the  electron beam.  Those
ions  forming  an ion  channel can  provide  the  background
gas  focusing forces and cause the  ion  hose  instability[5-
9].  The  background  gas  can  also  cause  an  emittance
growth by scattering the beam electrons.

4.1  Background Gas Effects

The  accumulated  difference 

the  phase  advance
between the beam head and the beam tail over a distance L
due to the  ion  focusing effects of  the  background gas  can

        (4)

A  large  difference  in  the  phase  advance  causes  beam
envelope oscillations  within  a pulse,  and  hence,  increase
the time integrated spot size. Therefore, to achieve a small
time  integrated spot  size,  ∆φ  should  be  much  less  than

2π. The pressure in the D-X needs to be much  less  than  5
x  10-8 torr  for  a  2  µs  beam  in  a  120m  long  beamline.
However, the electron beam is 2  µs  long  only  while  it  is
being extracted from the DARHT-II beamline. It  then  will
be chopped into four shorter pulses with the  longest  pulse
being  about  500  ns  wide.  The  subsequent  kickers  will
chop  these  four  pulses  further  into  even  shorter  pulses.
Most  of  the  ions  trapped  by  the  electron  beam’s  space
charge  potential  well  would  escape  to  the  wall  quickly
during the  pulse  separation time.  Therefore, a vacuum  of
~10-8 torr should be sufficient.

4.2  Ion Hose Instability

The ion-hose instability occurs when the  electron beam
is  not  collinear  with  the  ion  channel.  The  instability
grows with  time  and distance. It  grows  the  fastest  when
the  beam travels in  a  preformed  offset,  constant-strength
ion  channel  with  all  the  ions  oscillating  at  the  same
frequency. The maximum  number  of  e-folding  growth[6]
(Γ)  for  an  emittance  dominated  Bennett  beam  at  its
equilibrium travel a distance L is given as

Let  d be the  initial  separation between the  beam  and  the

displacement normalized to the beam radius. We now  have
λ =  (d/a)  eΓ.  Rearranging  Eq.  (5)  yields  to  the  pressure

Assume  that  the  initial  beam-channel  separation  is  0.5
mm,  for a 2  µs  long,  1  cm  radius  beam.  To  achieve  a
transverse beam motion at a x-ray target less  than  10%  of
the beam size, P ≤ 1 x 10-8 torr. A spread in ion’s mass  or
oscillation frequency damps the instability  growth[7].  The
detuning of the  ion  oscillating  frequency due to  the  beam
envelope changes either by  design or  by  mismatch  along
the  beamline  also  suppress  the  growth[8].  Furthermore,
the  recent  studies[8,  9]  suggest 
its  saturation
amplitude is always small compared with the beam radius.
All these may lead to a more relaxed vacuum requirement.

4.3  Background Gas Scattering

Scattering  in  a  background  gas  can  cause  emittance
growth. For a 20 MeV  beam traveling 120  m  in  10-8 torr
of  oxygen, 
total  emittance  growth  caused  by
background gas scattering is  1.38  x  10-3 π  mm-mr  which
is  insignificant  compared with  the  nominal  1000  π  mm-
mr emittance exiting the DARHT-II accelerator.

5  EMITTANCE GROWTH IN BENDS
A typical  D-X beamline consists  of  4  bending systems
and 
the  emittance
specification  at  the  D-X  targets,  the  relative  emittance
growth  for  each  bending  system  is  limited  to  5  %.
According to  Ref.  10,  the  emittance growth arising  from
nonlinear fields in the bend geometry is  negligible  for the
D-X. Most of the emittance  growth would come from the
nonuniform  image charge and current distributions  due to
the  geometric difference between the  cross-sections of  the

beam  and  the  pipe[11].  To  minimize  the  emittance
growth, the shape  of  the  beam pipe  needs to  be the  same
as  the  beam.  Typically,  the  shape  of  the  beam  cross-
section in  a bending system,  consisting  of  several  dipole
magnets and quadrupoles, varies from magnet to  magnet.
A nominal D-X bending system is  about  10  m  in  length.
Making  the  pipe  cross-section similar  to  the  beam cross-
section  along  the  bend  will  be  difficult  and  costly.  For
practical reasons, the  pipe  cross-section is  round  through
out the D-X beamline except where the  beampipe is  split.
The D-X transport tune  is  chosen  to  make  the  beam  as
round as possible and its  size much  smaller than  the  pipe
size so that the nonlinear image force effects are small.

6  MISALIGNMENT

Coupling  of  chromatic  aberration  of  a  misaligned
transport system  and the  time  dependent  energy  variation
within  a current pulse  leads to  a  time  varying  transverse
motion  called  corkscrew  motion[12,  13].  When 
the
difference in  the  total  phase  advance  (φ
tot  )  of  the  beam
transport  through  the  entire  system  is  small  compared
with  unity,  the  corkscrew  amplitude  for  this  transport
system with randomly misaligned magnets is given as

rms  is  the
r.m.s. value of the magnet tilts, ∆
rms is the r.m.s.  value of
the magnet offsets, and l is  the  magnet length  (nominally
20  cm).  The  amplitude  of  the  time  varying  transverse
beam motion on the DARHT-II target should be less  than
10% of the beam radius. The beam typically  has  to  travel
through approximately 100  more magnets to  reach its  D-
X converter target than to reach the  DARHT-II target.  Let
us  assume  that  the  corkscrew  amplitude  arising  from
misalignment  of  those  100  magnets  alone  is  also  one
tenth of the beam radius. The corkscrew amplitudes caused
by random tilts and offsets generally add in quadrature. The
net  corkscrew amplitude, including the  contribution  from
the  misaligned DARHT-II magnets,  at  a  D-X  target  will
be about 14 % of the beam radius. For the  worst  case, the
time  integrated D-X spot  size is  now  14  %  larger  versus
10 % larger for the time integrated DARHT-II spot  size if
the same focusing field is  used for both  systems.  We can
easily  compensate  for  this  difference  by  increasing  the
final focusing field at  the  D-X  target  area  by  4  %.  The
energy variation within the pulse is less than or equal to ±
0.5  %.  The  total  phase  advance  on  a  D-X  beamline  is
nominally ~14π. We assume that the  random tilts  and the
random  offsets  contribute 
the  corkscrew  motion
equally. According to Eq. (7), the r.m.s. tilt has  to  be less
than  0.8  mrad, and the  r.m.s.  offset  has  to  be  less  than
0.16 mm if no dynamic steering would be implemented to
control  the  corkscrew  motion.  These  specifications  are
very  similar  to  the  DARHT-II  alignment  specifications:

to 

1.95 mrad for the 3 σ in tilts and 0.45  mm  for the  3  σ  in
offsets.  Our  experience  on  dynamically  controlling  the
corkscrew  motion  on  ETA-II[13]  and  FXR[14]  and  the
simulations  of  corkscrew  control  on  DARHT-II  indicate
that corkscrew motion on D-X should not be a concern.

7  BEAM EXTRACTION AND

MODULARITY OF THE BEAMLINE

The first  design task  in  the  Diagnostic  X  beamline  is
the  beam  extraction  from  DARHTII.  Due  to  the  space
constraint,  the  beam will  be extracted before it  enters the
DARHT-II kicker. The beam will  be 2  µs  long  with  an
unknown  amount  of  beam  head  current.  To  prevent  the
beam from drilling a hole  through  the  D-X Al  beampipe,
the  extraction  line  should  coexist  with  the  DARHT-II
shuttle dump so that the  dump can be used to  characterize
the  beam  and  to  tune  the  DARHT-II  accelerator  before
bending the beam into the D-X transport system.

In  order  to  minimize  the  number  of  shots  needed  for
tuning  the  D-X  beamline,  the  beamline  will  consist  of
several  “identical”  modules,  such  as  10o,  45o  and  90o
achromatic  bend  systems,  90o  kicker  achromatic  bend
systems,  etc.  A  matching  section  precedes  each  module.
Operationally, we would tune  each type  of  module  once,
and then set all the identical module’s magnets at the same
tune.  We  then  would  only  tune  individual  matching
sections to match beams into the following modules.

8  CONCLUSIONS

Many  transport  concerns  have  been  discussed  in  this
paper. Based on our current knowledge of those potentially
degrading  mechanisms,  we  believe  that  they  can  be
suppressed.

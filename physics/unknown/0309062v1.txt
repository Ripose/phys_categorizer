Abstract: A cascaded iterative Fourier transform (CIFT) algorithm is presented for optical 

security  applications.  Two  phase- masks  are  designed  and  located  in  the  input  and  the 

Fourier  domains  of  a  4- f  correlator  respectively,  in  order  to  implement  the  optical 

encryption  or authenticity  verification.  Compared  with  previous  methods,  the  proposed 

algorithm  employs  an  improved  searching  strategy:  modifying  the  phase-distributions of 

both masks synchronously as well as enlarging the searching space. Computer simulations 

show that the algorithm results in much faster convergence and better image quality for the 

recovered  image.  Each  of  these  masks  is  assigned  to  different  person.  Therefore,  the 

decrypted image can be obtained only when all these masks are under authorization. This 

key-assignment strategy may reduce the risk of being intruded. 

1. Introduction 

Optical  techniques  have  shown  great  potential  in  the  field  of  information  security 

applications. Recently  Réfrégier and Javidi [1] proposed a novel double-random-phase encoding 

technique, which encodes a primary image into a stationary white noise. This technique was also 

used  to  encrypt  information  in  the  fractional  Fourier  domain  [2,  3]  and  to  store  encrypted 

 

1 

information  holographically  [4,  5].  Phase  encoding  techniques  were  also  proposed  for optical 

authenticity verification [6-8]. 

 

Wang  et  al  [9] and  Li  et  al  [10] proposed  another  method  for  optical  encryption  and 

authenticity  verification.  Unlike  the  techniques  mentioned  above,  this  method  encrypts 

information  completely  into  a phase  mask,  which  is  located  in  either  the  input  or  the  Fourier 

domain of a 4- f correlator. For instance, given the predefinitions of a significant image f(x, y)  as 

the  desired  output  and  a  phase-distribution  exp{jb(u,  v)}  in  the  Fourier  domain,  it’s  easy  to 

optimize  the  other  phase  function  exp{jp(x, y)} with a modified projection onto constraint sets 

(POCS)  algorithm  [10].  Therefore  the  image  f(x,  y)  is  encoded  successfully  into  exp{jp(x, y)} 

with  the  aid  of  exp{jb(u,  v)}.  In  other  words,  the  fixed  phase  exp{jb(u,  v)}  serves  as  the  lock 

while the retrieved phase exp{jp(x, y)} serves as the key of the security system. To reconstruct 

the original information, the phase functions exp{jp(x, y)} and exp{jb(u, v)} must match and be 

located  in  the  input  and  the  Fourier  plane  respectively.  Abookasis  et al  [11]  implemented  this 

scheme with a joint transform correlator for optical verification. 

However, because the key exp{jp(x, y)} contains information of the image f(x, y) and the 

lock exp{jb(u, v)}, and the 4- f correlator has a character of linearity, it is possible for the intruder 

to  find  out  the  phase-distribution  of  the  lock  function  by  statistically  analyzing  the  random 

characters of the keys if the system uses only one lock for different image. In order to increase 

the secure level of such system, one approach is to use different lock function for different image. 

Enlarging the key space is another approach to increase the secure level. It can be achieved by 

encrypting  images  in  the  fractional  Fourier  domain;  as  a  result,  the  scale  factors  and  the 

transform order offer additional keys [2, 3]. On the other hand, note that the phase- mask serves 

as the key of the system, enlarging the key space can be achieved by encoding the target image 

 

2 

into two or more phase masks with a modified POCS algorithm. Chang et al [12] have proposed 

a multiple-phases retrieval algorithm and demonstrated that an optical security system based on 

it  has  higher  level  of  security  and  higher  quality  for  the  decrypted  image.  However,  this 

algorithm  ret rieves  only  one  phase-distribution  with  a  phase  constraint  in  each  iteration.  As  a 

result, the masks are not so consistent and may affect the quality of the recovered image. 

In the present paper, we propose a modified POCS algorithm that adjusts the distributions 

of  both  phase- masks  synchronously  in  each  iteration.  As  a  result,  the  convergent  speed  of  the 

iteration  process  is  expected  to  significantly  increase.  And  the  target  image  with  much  higher 

quality is expected to recover because of the co-adjusting of the two masks during the iteration 

process. When the iteration process is finished, the target image is encoded into the phase- masks 

successfully.  Each  of  these  masks  severs  as  the  key  of  the  security  system  and  part  of  the 

encrypted  image  itself  as  well.  Moreover,  the  algorithm  can  be  extended  to  generate  multiple 

phase-masks  for  arbitrary  stages  correlator.  To  acquire  the  maximum  security,  each  key  is 

assigned to different authority so that the decryption cannot be performed but being authorized 

by  all  of  them.  This  key-assignment  scheme  is  especially  useful  for  military  and  government 

applications.  

The  algorithm  description  is  presented  in  Section  2.  Computer  simulation  of  this 

algorithm and the corresponding discuss are presented in Section 3.  

2. Cascaded Iterative Fourier Transform (CIFT) Algorithm 

Consider the operation of the encryption system with the help of a 4-f correlator as shown 

in Fig.1, the phase masks placed in the input and the Fourier planes are denoted as 

optf

yx
,(

)

 and 

opty

),( vu

, respectively, where (x, y) and (u, v) represent the space and the frequency coordinate, 

respectively. Once the system is illuminated with a monochromatic plane wave, a target image 

 

3 

yxf
,(

)

(an  image  to  be  decrypted  or  verified)  is  expected  to  obtain  at  the  output  plane.  The 

phase-masks 

optf

yx
,(

)

 and 

),( vuopty

  contain  the  information  of 

yxf
),(

,  that  is, 

yxf
,(

)

 is 

encoded  into  these  phase-masks.  The  encoding  process  is  the  optimization  of  the  two  phase-

distributions. It is somewhat similar with the problems of the image reconstruction and the phase 

retrieval,  which  can  be  solved  with  the  POCS  algorithm.  However,  the  present  problem  comes 

down to the phase retrieval in three (or more, in general) planes along the propagation direction. 

So the conventional POCS algorithm should be modified for this application. 

 

The cascaded iteration Fourier transform (CIFT) algorithm begins with the initialization 

of the phase-distributions of the masks. Suppose the iteration process reaches the  k th iteration (k 

= 1, 2, 3, …), and the phase-distributions in the input and the Fourier plane are represented as 

yxkf
),(

 and 

vuky
),(

,  respectively.  Then  an  estimation  of  the  target  image  is  obtained  at  the 

output of the correlator defined by

where FT and IFT denote the Fourier transform and the inverse Fourier transform, respectively,. 

If

where  ang{  ·  }  denotes  the  phase extraction function. Then  k is replaced by  k+1  for  the  next 

iteration.  It  is  shown  in  Eqs.  3(a)  and  3(b)  that  both  of  the  phase-distributions  are  modified  in 

every iteration, accorded to the estimation of the target image in the present iteration. It  ensures 

the algorithm converges with much faster speed and more consistent for the phase- masks. 

In general, the convergent criterion can be the MSE or the correlation coefficient between 

the iterated and the target image, which are defined by

rapidly in the  foremost few iterations, then it keeps reducing slowly till it reaches the minimum. 

Correspondingly,  the  correlation  coefficient  is  expected  to  increase  rapidly  at  first  and  keep 

increasing slowly till the stopping criterion is satisfied. 

 

In  decryption,  the  determined  phase-masks 

optf

yx
,(

)

 and 

),( vuopty

 (the  keys  or 

essentially, the encrypted images) are placed in the input and the Fourier plane, respectively, and 

then transformed into the output plane through the correlation defined by Eq. (1). The modulus 

of the output is the decrypted image. The CIFT algorithm retains the property of the conventional 

iteration  algorithm,  that  is,  the  final  phase-distributions  of  the  masks  are  determined  by  the 

initializations  of  them.  Therefore  different  initializations  will  result  in  different  distributions  of 

optf

yx
,(

)

 and 

opty

),( vu

. The target image cannot be decrypted if the keys mismatch (that is, the 

keys were generated from the different iteration process).  

 

In  practical  system,  the  phases  of  the  masks  are  quantized  to  finite  levels,  which  might 

reduce the solution space and introduce noise to the recovered image. To compensate the loss of 

the  quality,  the  target  image  can  be  encoded  into  more  phase- masks  to  provide  additional 

freedom for solutions searching, which means to encrypt the image with a multi-stages (cascaded) 

correlator. From the point of view of security, this strategy significantly enlarges the key space 

(because  more  keys  were  generated),  and  makes  the  intrusion  more  difficult.  Generally,  the  t-

stages correlation is defined as

for t is odd, where the matrix  I(x,  y)  represents  the  input  plane  wave,  and  the  superscr ipt  i (i=1, 

2, …,  t) denotes the serial number of the masks in the system. The phase-distributions of these 

masks may be deduced by analogous analysis for Eq. 3. 

3. Computer simulation 

In this section we numerically demonstrate our general concept. A jet plane image of the 

size 128 ·

 128 with 256 grayscale is used as the target image as shown in Fig. 2. The sizes of 

both phase-masks are same as the target image. And we suppose the optical system is illuminated 

by  a  plane  wave  with  the  amplitude  equating  to  1.  The  algorithm  starts  with  the  random 

initialization  of  the  two  phase-masks.  Then  the  phase  functions  are  transformed  forward  and 

backward alternatively through the correlation defined by Eqs. (1)-(3). The algorithm converges 

very  fast.  The  correlation  coefficient  reaches  0.99  after  about  3  iterations,  then  it  keeps 

increasing  slowly  and  finally  reaches  1  within  20  iterations,  correspondingly,  the  intensity 

distribution of the retrieved image is extremely close to that of the target image. Rigorously, the 

correlation  coefficient  does  converge  but  not  equate  to  1  no  matter  how  many  iterations  the 

algorithm runs because no analytic solutions for Eq. (1) can be found. Here we say it REACHES 

1  just  because  the  difference  between  the  two  images  is  beyond  the  limitation  of  the 

representational precision of the digital computer. Actually, the CIFT algorithm retains the error-

reducing  property  of  the  conventional  POCS  algorithm.  The  MSE  keeps  reducing  till  the  local 

(but  not  global)  minimum  is  reached.  One  interest ing  character  of  the  CIFT  algorithm  is  that 

arbitrary  initializations  can  generate  recovered  images  with  almost  same  quality,  and  result  in 

different  distributions  for  the  masks,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.  Therefore  the  optimized  phase- masks 

can be used as the keys of the security system. Only two phase- masks, which match each other 

and  are  located  in  the  appropriate  planes  of  the  4-f  architecture,  respectively,  can  recover  the 

 

7 

target 

image.  Otherwise, 

the  output 

is  meaningless.  On 

the  other  hand, 

the  keys

 and 

exp[

j

vu

)]

,  are  phase-only  functions,  and  have  random- like 

opt

opt

distributions as well. These characters may introduce a high level of security because they offer a 

property  of  anti-counterfeiting.  Another  secure  advantage  of  the  CIFT  algorithm  arises  in  the 

application  of  authenticity  verification.  Instead  of  detecting  a  single  correlation  peak,  the 

verification  system  based  on  the  CIFT  algorithm  detects  a  significant  output  to  determine 

whether  or  not  to  verify  the  input.  So  it  is  impossible  to  cause  a  false  verification  by  directly 

illuminating  the  output  plane  bypassing  the  correlator  because  the  intruder  cannot  generate  the 

same  pattern  at  the  output  without  the  knowledge  of  the  correct  phase-distributions.  This  is 

especially  useful  in  the  applications  where  high  security  is  necessary.  For  the  sake  of  security, 

the  two  masks  are  expected  assigning  to  two  persons,  respectively.  Therefore,  the  verification 

can be performed only under the authorizations of them both. If higher security is required, more 

phase-masks can be retrieved and assigned to more authorities so as to diminish the risk of being 

stolen of the keys.  

To  compare  with  previous  methods,  the  CIFT  algorithm  and  the  previous  methods  are 

investigated  under  the  same  initial conditions. Let Algorithm A, B, C and D denote the methods 

presented  in  Refs.  9,  10,  12  and  the  algorithm  proposed  in  the  present  paper,  respectively. 

Algorithm  A  and  B  merely  modify  the  distribution  of  single  mask,  which  is  located  in  the 

Fourier  plane  [9]  or  the  input  plane  [10],  respectively,  while  C  and  D  employ  a  searching 

strategy of modifying the distributions of both masks during the iteration process. Figs. 3(a)-3(d) 

show  the  corresponding  recovered  images  of  these  four  algorithms  at  the  100th  iteration.  It  is 

shown that Figs. 3(c) and 3(d) have much higher quality than Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). There may be 

two reasons that result in this fact. First, the solution space for C and D are significantly enlarged, 

 

8 

and consequently, it’s possible to find a better solution. Second, the latter two algorithms modify 

the  phase  distributions  of  both  masks  according  to  the  retrieved  image  at  the  present  iteration. 

This strategy ensures better solutions and much faster convergence. However, there is still a little 

difference  between  C  and  D.  Algorithm  C  alternatively  modifies  the  phase  distributions  at  the 

input  and  the  Fourier  planes.  That  is,  it  retrieves  the  first  phase- mask at certain iteration while 

fixing  the  others,  and  then  retrieves  the  second  one  at  the  next  iteration,  and  then  again  it 

retrieves the first one. This cycle keeps going on and on till the algorithm converges. But it’s not 

this  case  for  the  proposed  algorithm.  It  synchronously  modifies  both  the  phase-distributions in 

each  iteration.  This  change would result in faster convergence and higher recovered quality. The 

MSE and the correlation coefficient between the target image and the iterated images by the four 

algorithms,  respectively,  defined  by  Eq.  (4a)  and  (4b),  respectively,  at  the  100th  iteration  are 

shown in Table 1. Apparently, The results are consistent with those we figure out from Fig. 3. 

We have to point out that, although both of the correlation coefficients between Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 

2, and Fig. 3(d) and Fig. 2, respectively, SEEM to equate to 1, the corresponding MSEs are quite 

different.  Table  1  shows  that  the  quality  of  the  iterated  image  obtained  by  the  proposed  CIFT 

algorithm  is  significantly  better  than  those  obtained  by  others  methods,  owing  to  the  most 

effective searching strategy.  

 

To  evaluate  the  convergence,  we  set  the  convergent  criterion  R=0.998.  All  these 

algorithms are tested with an Intel® Pentium-IV 1.6 GHz PC and under the same initial condition. 

In  this  simulation,  it  takes  133.6720  seconds  and  622  iterations  for  the  Algorithm  A,  25.0620 

seconds and 100 iterations for Algorithm B and 3.9210 seconds and 15 iterations for Algorithm 

C,  respectively,  to  drive  R  to  this  threshold.  Comparably,  it  takes  only  2.3590  seconds  and  9 

iterations for the CIFT algorithm to reach the same threshold. Apparently, as we comment in the 

 

9 

previous  paragraph,  C  and  D  have  much  faster  convergent  speed.  The  MSEs  of  the 

corresponding algorithm are as follows: 9.8359· 10-4 for Algorithm A, 1.8· 10-3 for Algorithm B, 

1.2· 10-3 for algorithm C, and  6.4599· 10-4 for the CIFT algorithm, respectively. However, if the 

iteration  process  is  kept  proceeding  till  the  MSE  never  decreases  any  more,  this  value  is  quite 

different  for  different  algorithm.  Table  2  shows  the  comparison  among  these  algorithms  when 

the corresponding minimum is reached. This demonstrates the highest performance of the CIFT 

algorithm. 

 4. Conclusion 

A  cascaded  iterative  Fourier  transform  (CIFT)  algorithm  is  proposed  to  design  phase  masks  for 

optical security applications in this paper. Compared with previous methods, the proposed CIFT 

algorithm  adjusts  the  phase-distributions  of  both  masks  synchronously  as  well  as  enlarging  the 

searching  space,  and  consequently,  has  faster  convergent  speed  and  better  quality  for  the 

recovered image. The proposed algorithm encodes the target image into two phase-masks, which 

serve as the keys of the security system as well. These keys are assigned to different persons to 

obtain high level of security. Only under the authorizations of all these authorities, the decrypted

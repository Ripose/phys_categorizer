A compact liquid organic neutron spectrometer (CLONS) based on a single NE213 liquid scintillator (5 cm 
diam. x 5 cm) is described. The spectrometer is designed to measure neutron fluence spectra over the energy 
range 2-200 MeV and is suitable for use in neutron fields having any type of time structure. Neutron fluence 
spectra are obtained from measurements of two-parameter distributions (counts versus pulse height and 
pulse shape) using the Bayesian unfolding code MAXED. Calibration and test measurements made using a 
pulsed neutron beam with a continuous energy spectrum are described and the application of the 
spectrometer to radiation dose measurements is discussed. 
 
 

INTRODUCTION 

 Techniques  for  neutron  spectrometry  by  means  of 
the  unfolding  of  scintillation  pulse  height  spectra 
measurements  have  advanced  considerably  in  recent 
years(1).  Liquid  organic  scintillators  such  as  NE213, 
BC501A  and  EJ301  are  popular  detectors  for  this 
application because of their good pulse height response 
and  their  capability  to  discriminate  against  γ-rays  by 
means  of  pulse  shape(2).  However,  organic  scintillators 
are  less  convenient  for  the  pulse  height  spectrum 
unfolding method at high neutron energies (>100 MeV) 
because  detectors  of  linear  dimensions  >15  cm  are 
required  to  ensure  that  the  escape  of  high-energy 
charged  particles  (especially  forward  recoil  protons) 
from the detector is not excessive. A large fraction of the 
high-energy  particles  need  to  be  brought  to  rest  in  the 
scintillator in order for the pulse height response matrix 
of  the  detector  to  be  sensitive  to  the  incident  neutron 
energy  and  thus  be  suitable  for  use  in  pulse  height 
spectrum unfolding.   

In  this  paper  we  describe  an  investigation  of  an 
alternative unfolding approach based on the use of both 
pulse height (L) and pulse shape (S) measurements from 
a liquid organic scintillator. The L- and S-data are used 
to  derive  an  LS-signature  in  which  components  due  to 
escaping  particles  and  to  different  types  of  charged 
particles  (p,  d,  α,  etc.)  that  stop  in  the  scintillator  are 
separated. The LS-signature is then unfolded, instead of 
the  pulse  height  spectrum,  to  determine  the  neutron 
spectrum.  Escape  probabilities  for  the  heavier  charged 
particles, particularly the α-particles, are smaller than for 
protons.  This  factor,  together  with  others  such  as  the 
energy-dependence  of  the  relative  intensities  of  the 
different  components,  leads  to  an  LS-response  matrix

which  retains  its  neutron  energy-dependence  at  high 
energies  even  when  scintillators  of  small 
linear 
dimensions  (~5  cm)  are  used.    The  need  for  large 
detector  dimensions  in  order  to  perform  unfolding  at 
high neutron energies is thus relaxed. 

THE COMPACT LIQUID ORGANIC NEUTRON 
SPECTROMETER (CLONS) 

the  DOSMAX  project  at 

The prototype CLONS detector consists of a glass-
encapsulated  NE213  liquid  scintillator  (5  cm  diam.  x  5 
cm)  mounted  on  a  RCA  8575  photomultiplier  tube.  It 
was  tested  in  association  with  experiments  carried  out 
by 
in 
November 2003. The neutron beams and monitors used 
in  the  DOSMAX  experiments  were  calibrated  by  the 
PTB  members  of  the  DOSMAX  team  using  a  proton 
recoil  telescope  and  238U  and  235U  fission  ionization 
chambers. 

iThemba  LABS 

CLONS  was  tested  using  well-collimated  neutron 
beams produced by bombarding natural metallic targets 
of  either  lithium  (thickness  either  5  mm  or  8  mm)  or 
beryllium (thickness 13 mm) with a pulsed beam of 200 
MeV protons from the iThemba LABS separated-sector 
cyclotron.  The  CLONS  scintillator  was  mounted  in  the 
neutron beam  at a distance of 9.34  m (centre-to-centre) 
from the Li or Be target. Pulse shape discrimination was 
accomplished  using  a  Link  Systems  Model  5010  pulse 
shape discriminator unit. The outputs from the Link unit 
were recorded in list mode and then processed off-line(3) 
to produce a 3-parameter list file of the parameters L, S 
and T (neutron time-of-flight) for events recorded in the 
run. Four experimental runs were made, one run for each 
of  the  Li  targets  and  two  for  the  Be  target.  The  total 
beam  time  used  for  the  four  runs  was  2  hours.  The  list 
files obtained in the runs were analysed individually and 
also  in  different  combinations,  one  such  combination

being  an  “all-runs-list-file”  (ARLF)  consisting  of  the 
sum of events from all four runs. 

Figure  1  shows  a  plot  of  counts  versus  L  and  S 
obtained  from  data  selected  from  the  ARLF  by  a  time-
of-flight  window  corresponding  to  the  neutron  energy 
range 180-200 MeV. The structure in the S-parameter of 
this  plot  is  due  to  the  variety  of  charged  particles 
produced  by  neutrons  interacting  with  hydrogen  and 
carbon nuclei in the NE213 scintillator and the fact that 
the  scintillation  pulse  shape  depends  on  the  type  and 
energy  of  the  charged  particle  detected  and  whether  or 
not this particle is brought to rest in the scintillator. The 
prominent  ridges  in  the  plot  are  identified  as  follows: 
charged  particles  (mainly  protons)  that  escape  from  the 
scintillator (e); and protons (p), deuterons (d) and alpha-
particles  (α)  that  come  to  rest  in  the  scintillator.  The 
continuum (x) between the d- and α-ridges is attributed 
mainly  to  multiple  neutron  scattering  and  to  spallation 
reactions in which two or more charged particles (p, d, t 
or  τ)  are  detected  simultaneously  and  thus  produce  a 
variety of “non-standard” scintillation pulse shapes.

 Compton  electrons  from  the  detection  of  γ-rays 
fall on the e-ridge in Figure 1 but have been suppressed 
by  applying  an  LS-cut 
the  e-ridge 
completely for all L less than that corresponding to an 8 
MeV  electron.  The  number  of  Compton  electrons  that 
survive  this  cut  is  negligible  in  comparison  with  the 
escape  component  because 
intensity  of  γ-ray 
background spectra above 8 MeV is very small. 

that  excludes 

the 

Three  boundary  lines  B1,  B2  and  B3  (see  Figure 
1) were used to divide the LS-plane into four regions for 
the derivation of the LS-signature. These lines follow the 

minima (valleys) between the e- and p-ridges, the p- and 
the  α-ridge 
the  x-continuum  and 
d-ridges,  and 
respectively. The four regions are thus: e (L-axis to B1); 
p (B1 to B2); d+x (B2 to B3) and α (beyond B3). After 
selecting  a  threshold  value  for  L  the  counts  in  each 
region  were  separately  projected  onto  the  L-axis  to 
produce  a pulse  height  spectrum  of  64  channels  for  the 
region.  The  pulse  height  spectra  for  the  four  regions 
were  then  assembled  into  a  single  array  P  of  256 
channels 
in  which  successive  64-channel  sectors 
the  e,  p,  d+x  and  α-components 
correspond 
respectively.  This  P-array  is  the  P-response function of 
the  detector  for  neutrons  of  the  selected  mean  energy, 
for  example  190  MeV  in  the  case  of  Figure  1.  The 
response  function  is  normalised  so  as  to  make  the  sum 
of counts from P = 1-256 equal to unity. 

to 

The  same  procedure  is  followed,  but  without 
using  a  T-window  and  without  normalisation,  to  derive 
the LS-signature of an unknown neutron spectrum from 
the two-parameter measurements of L and S.  

Normalised P-response functions were determined 
as  outlined  above  (from  the  ARLF  and  using  the  same 
boundary lines B1-B3) for 46 different neutron energies 
(T-bins)  between  8.5  and  190  MeV.  The  T-bins  are 
numbered n = 1-46, from low to high energy, and their 
widths  in  terms  of  energy  units  vary  with  the  neutron 
energy. Figure 2 shows a plot of the “P-matrix”, R(n,P) 
formed  by  assembling  the  46  normalised  P-response 
functions  for  the  different  neutron  energies.  Some 
important features of the P-matrix are the following. The 
proportions of events in the four components (e, p, d+x 
and α) vary systematically with neutron energy. At low

functions for each neutron energy bin (n) are normalised so as 
to  make  Σ  R(n,  P)  =  1  for  the  sum  taken  over  P  =  1-256.  A 
threshold level of R(n, P) > 0.0002 was used in making the plot.

the e-component is weak. At the upper energy limit (n =

systematically  with neutron energy is clearly evident in

the  α-component  (determined  by  the  threshold  R(n,P)> 
0.0002) increases steadily with neutron energy from n = 
1-46.  These  features  enhance  the  energy-sensitivity  of 
the P-matrix and are thus important for the unfolding of 
LS-signatures.

measurements  made  using  the  CLONS  is  the  same  as 
that  used  to  obtain  neutron  spectra  by  unfolding  pulse 
height  spectra.  The  differences  are:  firstly,  an  LS-
signature is unfolded instead of a pulse height spectrum; 
and  secondly  the  pulse  height  response  matrix  is 
replaced by the P-matrix. The Bayesian unfolding code 
MAXED(4)  was  used  to  unfold  LS-signatures  derived 
from experimental data measured using CLONS and the 
resulting  unfolded  neutron  spectra  were  compared  with 
neutron spectra calculated

independently  from  the  time-of-flight  data  obtained 
simultaneously  with  the  L-  and  S-measurements.  Flat 
distributions  (see  Figure  3a)  were  used  as  default  (a-
priori) spectra for the MAXED unfolding. 

Figure 3a shows the spectral distribution C(E)  of 
neutron  counts  (per  unit  energy  and  unit  beam  area) 
obtained from one of the measurements made using the 
13  mm  thick  Be  target.  The  corresponding  spectral 
fluence  ФE(E)  is  shown  in  Figure  3b.  The  spectral 
fluence ФE(E) is given by ФE(E) = C(E)/ε(E) where ε(E) 
is the neutron detection efficiency and C(E) is given by 
C(E) = N(n)/A∆E(n). The index n denotes the energy bin 
of mean energy E, N(n) is the number of counts in bin n, 
determined  from  either  the  time-of-flight  measurement 
or  by  unfolding,  A  is  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the 
detector that is covered by the neutron beam and ∆E(n) 
is  the  energy  width  of  bin  n.  The  neutron  detection 
efficiency ε(E) was determined from ε(E) = C(E)/ФE(E) 
using the time-of-flight measurement of C(E) for the Be 
target  (Figure  3a)  and  the  spectral  fluence  ФE(E) 
determined  for  the  same  target  and  beam  conditions  in 
the  DOSMAX  calibration 
runs  were 
normalised to the same number of monitor counts, based 
on  the  neutron  beam  monitors  used  in  the  DOSMAX 
run.  Figure  3c  shows  the  spectral  fluences  similarly 
determined for the 8 mm thick Li target.  

runs.  All 

Figure  4  shows  results  from  MAXED  unfolding 
of three further test spectra obtained by applying various 
arbitrary time-of-flight profiles to the data of the ARLF. 
The  three  profiles  defined:  (a)  a  “delta  function” 
corresponding  to  a  mean  neutron  energy  of  105  MeV; 
(b)  a  broad  distribution  of  the  same  mean  neutron 
energy;  and  (c)  a  two-peak  spectrum  with  a  continuous 
energy  distribution  between  the  peaks.  The  procedure 
for  these  tests  was  as  follows:  (i)  a  subset  of  events 
conforming  to  the  specified  profile  in  the  T-parameter 
was  selected  from  the  ARLF;  (ii)  an  LS-signature  was 
formed from the L  and S parameters for this subset; and 
(iii) this signature was unfolded using MAXED. Figures 
4a-c  show  spectral  fluences  corresponding  to  the 
selected  time-of-flight  profiles  (histograms)  and  the 
results  obtained  from  the  MAXED  unfolding  (points) 
for the three test runs. 

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

For  the  experimental  measurements  made  using 
the  Be  and  Li  targets  (Figures  3b  and  3c)  the  spectra 
obtained  by  unfolding  agree  reasonably  well  with  the 
corresponding time-of-flight spectra at low energies, E < 
60 MeV, but not so well at higher energies. For the test 
spectra  shown  in  Figure  4  the  agreement  between  the 
unfolded  spectra  and  corresponding 
time-of-flight 
spectra  is  also  better  at  lower  neutron  energy  than  at 
high  energy.  The  relatively  poor  performance  of 
CLONS  in  determining  spectra  at  the  higher  energies 
can  probably  be  attributed 
insufficient 
statistical accuracy in the response matrix (see Figure 2) 

largely 

to 

F.D. Brooks et al 

and, to a lesser extent, to the limited statistical accuracy 
of  the  LS-signatures  used  in  the  unfolding.  Since  the 
total  beam  time  used  in  this  work  was  only  two  hours 
both  of these problems  could probably  be alleviated  by 
making  longer  runs.  The  choice  of  neutron  production 
targets to be used in future runs could also be improved 
by including an additional target such as carbon (10-20 
mm  thick),  to  provide  a  more  equi-energy  neutron 
spectrum in the ARLF.

calculating fractional deviations φH = (HU - HT)/HT. The 
values  of  φH  calculated  from  the  spectra  shown  in 
Figures  3b,  3c  and  4a-c  are  0.046,  0.049,  0.092,  0.054 
and  0.036  respectively,  thus  showing  that  he  CLONS 
prototype  is  capable  of  determining  ambient  dose 
equivalents  to  an  accuracy  of  4-9%  for  neutron  spectra 
in the range 9-190 MeV. 

in 

The 

this 
test  measurements  described 
investigation were limited to the neutron energy range 9-
190  MeV  by  the  dynamic  range  attainable  using  the 
Link  5010  pulse  shape  discriminator,  an  analogue 
electronic instrument. The spectrum unfolding method is 
now widely used for neutron spectrometry in the neutron 
range  2-15  MeV(1).  By  using  different 
energy 
electronics,  including  flash  ADCs  and  on-line  digital 
processing,  for  example,  it  should  be  possible  to 
improve the dynamic range of the CLONS so as to cover 
energies  from  1  to  200  MeV  in  a  single  compact  and 
simple  instrument.  Such  an  instrument  would  require 
only  a  single  initial  calibration  run  at  a  pulsed  neutron 
facility  such  as  iThemba  LABS.  After  calibration  the 
spectrometer  will  be  suitable  for  operation  in  neutron 
fields  having  any  type  of  time  structure.  The  right 
cylinder  geometry  of  the  NE213  scintillator  of  the 
CLONS  ensures  that  its  response  is  approximately 
independent  of 
incident  neutron  direction.  A 
spherical  scintillator  can  be  used  if  a  more  isotropic 
response is required.

When considering past and current successes in the 
building and operation of the RHIC Computing 
facility’s General Computing Environment three 
principles have proven helpful in developing a useful 
work environment for our scientists while also 
keeping our facility manageable. 
 
•Consolidation 
•Documentation 
•High Availability 
 
Consolidation 
refers to both Hardware and Software platforms. By 
having a single hardware platform such as SUN 
servers, we are able to maintain a small spare parts 
cache that is very effective as well as have expertise 
in dealing with common hardware issues. 
By having a single Operating System to maintain we 
are able to maintain a high level of expertise in it’s 
management, have disk images that reflect various 
patch levels and OS releases for our systems, provide 
a software repository for programs built on this 
platform, as well as stay on top of security and bug 
fixes for this operating environment. 
  
Below I’ve presented three evolutions of our server 
hardware environment. We began with system 
cabinets containing a mix of hardware. Having a 
variety of vendors caused problems with purchasing 
and support. Various manufacturers had different 
methods of operation and it was difficult to be 
efficient in planning consumption of space and 
power.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Over time, we’ve migrated to a system of racks 
containing servers of similar manufacturer, similar 
operating system.  
 
Below I’ve presented several evolutions of our disk 
hardware environment. We began with direct connect 
RAID controllers. We grew by building a large Fibre 
Channel SAN and attaching high bandwidth, high 
availability, high capacity storage to it. Note the 
increase of density with each purchase. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Documentation 
is necessary for several reasons, the most important 
ones being the tracking of what equipment you have 
in production, facilitating repair during emergencies,  
mapping ones current environment for the benefit of 
vendors working on future procurements, as well as 
the increased understanding of ones environment and 
skills which comes about from the process of trying 
to document it. Below I’ve provided screenshots of 
some of our more important documentation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The “Facility Blueprint” is very helpful as a starting 
point for discussions with vendors and support 
technicians in conceptualizing our facility. 
 
Each Fibre Channel device on a SAN (Storage Area 
Network) has a unique ID. We track every  port on 
our SAN and what is plugged into it. Below is part of 
our list of devices associated with their switch ports 
and unique World Wide Port ID.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Below is a segment of our page which lists which 
filesystems are mounted and served by which servers.

devices and which server they are mounted upon. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

High Availability 
is an essential concern when building a large facility 
because you cannot plan forward when you are tied 
up in issues regarding your current facility. Once 
equipment is installed it is the hope of both the user 
and system support that it will be stable and provide 
many years of reliable use. 
 
High availability can be addressed on both the clients 
and servers.  
 
- Clients - 
should not be using NFS hard mounts to the server. 
Nor should they be using the server’s true system 
name. 
 
By using an automount daemon to mount the 
Network File System when it is  needed, many NFS 
filesystem outages are missed by clients that are not 
currently using the NFS mount. They also resolve 
themselves when the resource returns. This allows 
most quick reboots of the servers to pass unnoticed 
by non-interactive batch programs running on the 
clients. 
 
By using DNS aliases in your client’s system files 
rather than true server names you are able to move 
storage to another server by making a single change 
in one place, the DNS database, rather than editing 
the system files on every possible client which may 
mount the exported filesystem. 
 
 
DNS aliases are helpful in two roles. Virtualizing the 
server name and distributing load onto multiple 
machines. 
 
The following is an example of a DNS lookup of a 
system alias: 
 
# nslookup starnfs 
Name: rnfs09.rcf.bnl.gov 
Address: 13.19.26.4 
Aliases: starnfs.rcf.bnl.gov 
 
The following is an example of round-robin load 
sharing using DNS: 
 
# nslookup rssh 
Name: rssh.rcf.bnl.gov 
Addresses: 13.19.6.7, 13.19.6.3, 13.19.6.4 

- Servers - 
need to assess “Single Point Of Failure” 
 
Items to be considered are: 

•  HBA (Host Bus adapter) 
•  Cabling 
•  Disk Controllers 
•  Disks 

 
Sometimes responding to SPOF introduces 
additional complexity and another new SPOF 
 
HBA 
When connecting external disks with a HBA, it is 
advantageous to have two adapters in the server to 
eliminate SPF. 
This requires Multipathing software and a 
multiported disk system. 
 
Cabling 
Multiple HBA / Disk Controller paths requires 
multiple cable connections. 
Introduction of a switch in the cable path allows for 
greater access possibilities, higher availability, but 
introduces another SPOF. 
 
Disk Controllers 
Their failover ability will determine if component 
failure is transparent to server, and if repair can be 
done online. 
Also determines how component disks are configured 
for performance, reliability, or maximum capacity.  
 
Disks 
Disks should be configured with some element of 
redundancy RAID 1,3,5 so that a single disk failure 
wont take the LUN offline. 
System should provide for configuration of a hot 
spare, and possess the ability to perform automatic 
rebuild. 
 
Fibre Channel Switches 
Implementing a single switch solution introduces  a 
SPOF, but benefits are increased number of data 
paths. 
There are suggested switch topologies which will 
remove SPOF. Recommended topology has a 
maximum of one hop to any other switch. Core / 
Edge Topology is utilized at RCF. Double Core 
switches, and a split fabric is highly resilient. 

Is High Availability Achieved? 
 
We removed these SPOF: 

 
•  Root disk on server 
•  Server Power 
•  Server HBAs 
•  Cabling 
•  FC Switch 
•  FC Switch Power 
•  RAID power supplies 
•  Disk Controllers 
•  Disks

Configuring Storage 
as a vehicle to present component storage concepts. 
 

•  Map Storage to Server (SAN Zoning) 
•  Map LUN to Server (Disk Controller) 
•  Map Storage to Target (HBA Config) 
•  Mount Disk 
•

Log on to SAN. 
 Tool used here is Brocade Fabric Manager 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Open a “Name Server” Window to identify the “WWN device ID” of your Fibre Channel device by looking up 
the port that it is physically plugged in to. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Open a “Zone Admin” Window to identify the “WWN device ID” of your Fibre Channel device with a friendly 
name that will be easier to use in your SAN zoning configuration. ( create a Alias ) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Open a “Zone Admin” Window to create a zone which allows access between the proper devices, using your 
preconfigured device aliases. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Connectivity between the servers and disks has been established through the switches. Map the disk storage 
to the desired server using a utility provided by the manufacturer which assigns LUNS to servers using the 
WWN of the server’s Fibre Channel  Adapter. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Use of Bindings 
 
The following information illustrates the settings of 
the Fibre Channel HBA driver for use of bindings 
on the FC adapter card. This allows you to make the 
target device number static on all servers for the 
WWN of the device. This allows you to accurately 
track use of storage across your facility.  
 
Settings in qla2200.conf file: 
 
# MTI10 
hba0-SCSI-target-id-220-fibre-channel-name= 
"21000cc001000939"; 
hba0-SCSI-target-id-221-fibre-channel-name= 
"23000cc001000939"; 
hba1-SCSI-target-id-220-fibre-channel-name= 
"21000cc001000939"; 
hba1-SCSI-target-id-221-fibre-channel-name= 
"23000cc001000939"; 
 
Results of persistent binding configuration 
demonstrated using the “format” command:

256 sec 128>/pci@4,2000/scsi@1/sd@dc,0 
7. c4t220d2 <MTI-S200-7770 cyl 52066 alt 2 hd 
256 sec 128>/pci@4,2000/scsi@1/sd@dc,2 
9. c4t221d1 <MTI-S200-7770 cyl 52066 alt 2 hd 
256 sec 128>/pci@4,2000/scsi@1/sd@dd,1 
 
Multipathing 
 
When connecting storage to servers using switches 
and multiple HBAs in the server, there will be 
multiple images of each storage device presented to 
the server’s operating system. This is desirable as 
each device presented is in reality another path 
between the server and its storage and provides 
higher availability to the storage. This configuration 
requires special software to handle the multiple 
paths to the storage without causing controller 
confusion or filesystem corruption.  In our case 
Veritas Volume Manager is used to handle the 
mulipathing. Below, the output of a query on disk 
c2t185d1s2 shows the true 4 paths which are used 
to access it. 
 
numpaths:   4 
c2t185d1s2      state=enabled 
c2t186d1s2      state=enabled 
c3t185d1s2      state=enabled 
c3t186d1s2      state=enabled 

In the given example “c2” and “c3” are the 2 HBAs 
of the server, “t185” and “t186” are the 2 disk 
controllers of the RAID system, “d1” is the LUN id 
built on the RAID system and “s2” is the Solaris 
disk partition which represents the whole disk.  
 
 
Veritas Software: 
 
Because it is an integral part of our disk 
management process, I will attempt to describe 
some of the basic concepts. 
 
Benefits: 
 
. Physical Disk is unimportant 
. Resize/Reconfigure Volumes during Realtime 
. Mirroring and Moving data is transparent 
. Provides organization and portability of data 
. Multi-Pathing for High Availability 
 
Shortcomings of mounting common disks: 
 
. Disk is known by O/S as a fixed name dependent   
upon hardware path. 
. Disk can be divided into partitions which are 
permanent as long as data is on them. 
 
Integrating Veritas Volume Management: 
 
. Once a disk is brought under volume manager 
control it becomes a Veritas resource and can be 
manipulated in many ways. 
 
Explaining Veritas Subdisks: 
 
Rather than mounting a partition of a disk, Veritas 
creates a public partition encompassing all of the 
disk and allows you to use all or some of the storage 
on the disk as a virtual partition called a “subdisk” 
 
Once you’re using a subdisk to mount a filesystem 
you can dynamically resize your partition. 
 
Explaining Veritas Plexes: 
 
  
Though your filesystems 
 
may often be smaller than 
 
your disk, sometime it is 
 
greater than the size of one 
 
disk. This necessitates the 
 
additional concept of a 
 
“plex”. 
 

Veritas Disk Groups: 
 
A disk group is the unit of Portability for Veritas 
Volume Manager. A group of disks can be moved 
between machines and irregardless of O/S 
identification of hardware, Veritas will put all of the 
pieces together. Below is an example of Disk Group 
components. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

To have a mountable object that is larger than any 
single device, you must be able to glue storage 
together in either a concatenated or striped method. 
Concatenated disks write in one stream, filling in 
empty space as it is found on the multiple pieces. 
Striped plexes write to similar size subdisks 
concurrently, increasing performance with multiple 
I/O streams. 
 
Concatenated Plex 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Striped Plex 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Explaining Veritas Volumes: 
 
Sometimes you want multiple copies of your data 
(mirroring) This introduces the concept of a 
“volume”. Since a plex has all the pieces which 
make up one copy of your data, a volume is made of 
one or one or more plexes which each have a copy 
of your data.

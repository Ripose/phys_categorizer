Abstract 

The paper aims at presenting a didactic and self-contained overview of Gauss-Hermite and 

Gauss-Laguerre laser beam modes. The usual textbook approach for deriving these modes is to 

solve the Helmoltz electromagnetic wave equation within the paraxial approximation. Here, a 

different technique is presented: Using the plane wave representation of the fundamental Gaus-

sian mode as seed function, all higher-order beam modes are derived by acting with differential 

operators on this fundamental solution. Even special beam modes as the recently introduced 

Bessel beams are easily described within that framework.

Introduction 

The description of the spatial structure of the different beam modes has been object of theoreti-

cal and experimental analysis since the invention of the laser, and now is a standard textbook 

topic in modern optics and laser physics courses. The usual starting point for the derivation of 

laser beam propagation modes is solving the scalar Helmholtz equation within the paraxial ap-

proximation [1-3]. In this paper we present a didactic and self-contained overview of the differ-

ent laser beam modes by introducing a unified theoretical treatment based on a plane wave rep-

resentations of the electromagnetic field. This approach can be easily generalized to non-

paraxial situations and to include vector effects of the electromagnetic field. All higher-order 

beams, like for instance Hermite-Gaussian, Laguerre-Gaussian, and Bessel beams can elegantly 

be derived by acting with differential operators on the plane wave representation of the funda-

mental Gaussian mode used as a seed function [4-9]. Still recently, higher-order laser beams 

were the object of study of a restricted group of specialists. Thank to several new applications 

especially in the field of optical trapping, the interest concerning these beams is now rising rap-

idly. Optical tweezers with more sophisticated features can be realized with higher-order 

beams. Laguerre-Gaussian beam can transfer orbital momentum to a trapped particle, inducing 

it to rotate around the optical axis. For this reason, Laguerre-Gaussian optical tweezers are also 

known as “optical vortices” [10-13]. Laguerre-Gaussian tweezers can also trap metallic parti-

cles or particles with a refractive index higher than that of the surrounding medium [14, 15]. 

So-called Bessel beams [16, 17] are a further interesting example of higher-order beams which 

can be conveniently described by the plane wave representation. Bessel beams are also known 

as “non-diffracting” modes, because they have the property of self-reconstructing after encoun-

tering an obstacle [18]. Several new promising applications of Bessel beams are emerging. For 

 

2

example, simultaneous trapping of several particles over large axial distances (in the range of 

millimeters) is possible by using just one single Bessel beam [19].  

This paper is organized as follows. First, the Gaussian fundamental mode is introduced as the 

beam solution jointly minimizing both beam divergence and beam diameter. Basic concepts 

such as Rayleigh length, beam waist, wave front curvature, and Gouy’s phase are introduced. 

Following, Hermite-Gauss beams with complex arguments in the Hermite functions (also called 

“elegant” Hermite-Gaussian modes in the literature [1, 5, 6]) are derived by differentiating the 

fundamental Gauss mode with respect to the transverse coordinates. Next, it is shown how this 

derivation can be generalized to obtain a whole family of Hermite-Gauss modes, including also 

those with real arguments in the Hermite functions (termed also “standard” Hermite-Gaussian 

modes). The same approach is subsequently extended to derive Laguerre-Gaussian modes. Fi-

nally, Bessel beams are presented as special cases of plane wave representations, and the con-

cepts of non-diffractivity and self-reconstruction are briefly discussed. 

 

 

The fundamental Gaussian mode 

In the scalar field approximation (e.g. neglecting the vector character of the electromagnetic 

field), any electric field amplitude distribution can be represented as a superposition of plane 

waves, i.e. by

for an arbitrary choice of the amplitude function 

, which can be directly demonstrated 

(
x kkA ,

)y

by substituting Eq.(1) into Eq.(2). Representation (1) is chosen in such a way that the net en-

ergy flux connected with the electromagnetic field is towards the propagation axis z. Every 

plane wave is connected with an energy flow that has direction k and value

, n 

being the refractive index of the medium, and c denoting the speed of light in vacuum.  

Actual lasers generate a spatially coherent electromagnetic field which has a finite transversal 

extension and propagates with moderate spreading. That means that the wave amplitude 

changes only slowly along the propagation axis (z-axis) compared to the wavelength and finite 

width of the beam. Thus, the paraxial approximation can be applied to Eq.(1), assuming that the 

amplitude function 

(
x kkA ,

)y

 falls off sufficiently fast with increasing values of 

yxk ,

 so that the 

integration limits can be extended to plus/minus infinity, and that the root occurring in the ex-

ponent in Eq.(1) can be expanded into 

k

 significantly contribute to the integral’s final value. 

Two principal characteristics of the total energy flux can be considered: the divergence (spread 

of the plane wave amplitudes in wave vector space), defined as

The transition from the l.h.s. to the r.h.s. in the last expression is obtained by inserting represen-

tation Eq.(1) for E and carrying out the integrations over x and y. 

Let us seek the fundamental mode of a laser beam as the electromagnetic field having simulta-

neously minimal divergence and minimal transversal extension, i.e. as the field that minimizes 

the product of divergence and extension.  

By symmetry reasons, this leads to looking for an amplitude function minimizing the product  

and a similar product for the y-direction. Next, one can employ the Schwartz inequality which 

states that, for two arbitrary complex functions

where a partial integration was used in the transition from the middle to the last line, assuming 

that the amplitude A vanishes for 

±∞→xk

. Thus, if the norm  A  is kept constant, the product 

of divergence and extension reaches its minimum when the l.h.s. in the last equation becomes 

equal to the r.h.s., which is only the case if  Ak x

 and

Thus, seeking the field with minimal divergence and minimal transversal extension has led di-

rectly to the fundamental Gaussian beam. This means that the Gaussian beam is the mode with 

minimum uncertainty, i.e. the product of its sizes in real space and wave-vector space is the 

theoretical minimum as given by the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle of Quantum Mechan-

ics. Consequently, the Gaussian mode has less dispersion than any other optical field of the 

same size, and its diffraction sets a lower threshold for the diffraction of real optical beams. 

The diameter of the Gaussian beam is defined by

sequence that the surfaces of constant phase are not planes perpendicular to the axis of propaga-

If the beam is not strongly focused, neglecting Gouy’s phase in this derivation is a valid ap-

proximation, because  ζ  has large values and arctan(ζ) changes only slowly with changing ζ.

The intensity distribution

w = λ . Displayed are sections perpendicular to the propagation axis at equally

spaced positions with 250 λ distance. Each section is drawn until the intensity 

2

0E  has fallen 

off to 

51 e  of its maximum value at ρ = 0. The increasing diameter of the drawn sections is thus 

a measure of the beam divergence. Fig.1 shows also the phase of the electric field. The occur-

rence of rings (phase changes) within the planar cross-sections reflects the curvature of the 

wavefronts, causing the phase to change increasingly faster with increasing z when moving 

away from the axis 

0=ρ

. The change of the phase along the optical axis from its value 0 to 2π 

reflects the „phase jump” of the electric field when propagating through the point of minimum 

extension (beam waist) as described by Gouy’s phase.  

Before moving on to the derivation of higher-order Gaussian beams in the next sections, we 

will shortly stop here for looking at the interaction of a Gaussian beam with an ideal, infinitely 

thin lens. The result which will be derived here can be easily generalized for the whole family

of Gaussian beams the we will consider below. For considering the action of a lens onto a

Hermite-Gaussian modes

symmetry along the propagation axis. In order to derive such modes, the simplest approach is to 

include an additional modulation of the form

The found solution includes complex-valued arguments in both the exponential and pre-

exponential functions, and is known as the “elegant” representation of Hermite-Gaussian 

modes, because of its mathematical elegancy. However, it is more convenient to have complex 

values only in the exponential function, allowing a clear distinction between the field amplitude 

and phase. To achieve that one can try to use a modified amplitude modulation in Eq.(27). In-

This representation also obeys the scalar wave equation because the operators in front of

do not depend on x or y and commute with

 and

. Eq.(34) leads to a new family of 

solutions for the electric field of a propagating laser beam, parameterized by the arbitrary pa-

rameter u. Here, we will seek the special value of u that leads to a final result where all pre-

exponential functions depend on real arguments only. By using the identity 

which can be proofed directly by inserting S from Eq.(28), Eq.(34) can be cast into the form

Laguerre-Gauss modes 

Differently from Hermite-Gaussian beams, Laguerre-Gaussian modes have rotational symmetry 

along their propagation axis and carry an intrinsic rotational orbital angular momentum of 

hi per photon [10, 11 and references therein]. This means that a refractive object placed along 

the propagation axis will experience a torque. This property of Laguerre-Gaussian beams is of 

considerable practical interest, particularly in the field of optical trapping and for driving mi-

cromachined elements with light. It is important to point out that this intrinsic rotational mo-

mentum has to be distinguished from the angular momentum due to the polarization of light. 

Laguerre-Gaussian modes can be derived by modulating the amplitude function 

(
x kkA ,

)y

 with 

a periodic function of the angular variable

. Taking into account the identity

Similarly to the visualization of the Hermite-Gauss modes in the previous section, Fig.3 shows 

the real part of the obtained amplitudes within the plane 

0=z

 up to 

n m = . As can be seen, 

3

,

the real part of the amplitudes are rotationally symmetric around the axis  z , and the number 

1+m  is the number of minima and maxima along a radial line from the center 

0=ρ

 (note that 

the first minimum always occurs at 

0=ρ

, where the amplitude vanishes). The number  n  de-

fines by how many full cycles of  π2  the phase is changing when one goes around the axis of 

 

18

propagation 

0=ρ

, and thus defines the chirality of the mode. This phase behavior for 

31K=n

 

is shown in Fig.4, where surfaces of constant phase, 

arg

Bessel beams 

 

 

Any light beam whose energy is confined to a finite region around its axis of propagation is 

subject to diffractive spreading as it propagates in free space. The Rayleigh length is the charac-

teristic distance beyond which diffraction becomes increasingly noticeable. This is the case for 

all beams that we have analyzed so far: Gaussian, Hermite-Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian 

beams with beam waist w0 diverging with a divergence angle 

arctan

(

lim

( )

=

. However, there exists a family of laser beams which main-

tain a constant intensity profile along the propagation direction, so-called non-diffracting 

beams, which were first described by Durnin in 1987 [16]. They can be easily derived within 

the framework of the plane-wave representation Eq.(1) by choosing the special, δ-function 

modulation function

where 

0J   denotes  the  zero-order  Bessel  function  of  the  first  kind,  which  lends  this  family  of 

beams  also  the  name  Bessel  beams.  When 

,  one  obtains  simply  a  plane  wave,  but  for 

0=⊥k

19

positive values of  k⊥  the solution is a non-diffracting beam whose intensity profile decays in-

versely proportional to k⊥ρ . The width of the central intensity maximum is determined by ⊥k , 

reaching a minimum value of approximately 3 / 4λ

 when 

k

⊥ = = πλ . Obviously, the intensity 

2

k

distribution 

2E  of Bessel beams does no longer depend on the variable z. Bessel beams resem-

ble narrow light rods with a surrounding concentric ring structure, propagating through space 

without divergence. In sharp contrast to Gaussian beams, the energy density of Bessel beams is 

no longer confined to the vicinity of the propagation axis: The integral

is highly divergent. Thus, an ideal Bessel beams cannot be realized in practice, since producing 

a beam whose transversal profile is invariant with longitudinal distance would require an infi-

nite aperture and infinite energy. However, approximations of Bessel beams can be created ex-

perimentally, for example by using an axicon (a conical prism) [20, 21], an annular aperture, or 

diffractive  optical  elements  [23].  An  important  application  of  approximate  Bessel  beams  has 

emerged  in  special  setups  for  optical  trapping.  Since  the  diffraction-limited  region  of  an  ap-

proximate Bessel beam extends over large propagation distances, multiple trapping of particles 

with a single beam becomes possible [19]. A further important characteristic of non-diffracting 

beams is their ability to self-reconstruction after interaction with an obstacle [18]: Even if the 

central intensity maximum of a Bessel beam is completely blocked by an object, the beam re-

forms its original field distribution after some propagation distance. Several practical applica-

tions [20, 23] of this property have been suggested.

Conclusion 

The plane wave representation of Eq.(1), that was the starting point for deriving the different 

beam modes, has the significant advantage that it is easy to generalize. Other cases of interest 

can be readily analyzed. For example, it is straightforward to derive beam modes with non-axial 

symmetry by using an amplitude function of the form (

∝

]4

, re-

sulting in elliptical beams with the two principal planes xz and yz, and a set of two beam pa-

rameters

yxw ,0

. Such beams are also called astigmatic, because generally the position of the 

beam waist along the axis of propagation will be different within the two principal planes. For 

several applications, e.g. when considering the propagation of laser light in optically anisot-

ropic media, it is necessary to take into account the vector character of the electromagnetic field 

[4]. This can be easily done by replacing the scalar amplitude function in Eq.(1) by a vector 

function which has to be chosen in such a way that the direction of the amplitude vector is per-

pendicular to the wave vector of the corresponding plane wave component, ensuring that the 

whole representation automatically obeys the vector wave equation. For example, the vector 

amplitude function of an x-polarized beam has then the form (

focused beams, the paraxial condition does no longer hold (see e.g. [24]), so that the extension

Eq.(1) (and its vector analog) still holds and is a perfect starting point for numerical evaluation 

of non-paraxial beams.

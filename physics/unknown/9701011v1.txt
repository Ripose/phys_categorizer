Abstract

We study the semigroup of Bogoliubov endomorphisms of the canoni-
cal commutation relations which give rise to representations of the Cuntz
algebra O∞ on Fock space and describe the corresponding Cuntz algebra
generators in detail.

Introduction

The appearance of the Cuntz algebras Od [1] is a generic feature of quantum
ﬁeld theory. This fact has been discovered, within the algebraic approach [2],
by Doplicher and Roberts [3] who associated with each localized morphism ̺ of
dimension d and obeying permutation group statistics a multiplet Ψ1, . . . , Ψd of
local ﬁeld operators, acting on a Hilbert space which contains each superselec-
tion sector with some multiplicity, such that Cuntz’ relations hold

and such that, for any local observable A,

(1.2)

Regarding the Ψj as an orthonormal basis for the closure H(̺) of their linear
span, one says that ‘̺ is implemented by the Hilbert space H(̺) of isometries’.
These observations motivated a study of endomorphisms of the CAR alge-
bra which can be implemented by Hilbert spaces of isometries on Fock space
[4]. Here we present a similar analysis for endomorphisms of the canonical com-
mutation relations (CCR) or, more precisely, of the Weyl relations. As in [4],
we ﬁnd it convenient to use Araki’s ‘selfdual’ formulation [5, 6] which is brieﬂy
introduced in Sect. 2. We discuss a class of natural endomorphisms of the CCR
algebra (‘Bogoliubov endomorphisms’) in Sect. 3. As a generalization of Shale’s

condition for automorphisms [7], we state a necessary and suﬃcient condition for
Bogoliubov endomorphisms to be implementable in a ﬁxed Fock representation.
The derivation of this result is based on known criteria for quasi–equivalence of
quasi–free states [5, 8, 6] and can, at one point, be reduced to the CAR case,
by using an inequality due to Araki and Yamagami [9].

The topological semigroup of implementable endomorphisms is the subject
of Sect. 4. It can be written as a product of a subgroup consisting of automor-
phisms which are close to the identity, and the sub–semigroup of endomorphisms
which leave the given Fock state invariant. This decomposition enables us to
determine the connected components of the semigroup.
It also plays a role
in Sect. 5 which is concerned with the construction of orthonormal bases for
the Hilbert spaces H(̺). These Hilbert spaces themselves carry the structure
of symmetric Fock spaces and thus are, for genuine endomorphisms, inﬁnite–
dimensional. The C*–algebra generated by a single H(̺) is O∞. Implementers
are constructed by an adaptation of Ruijsenaars’ formulas for unitary imple-
menters of automorphisms [10]. They can be written as products of certain
isometries belonging to the commutant of the range of ̺ times a Wick ordered
exponential of an expression which is bilinear in creation and annihilation oper-
ators. The connection with the aforementioned product decomposition is that,
roughly speaking, the ﬁrst factor carries the exponential term, whereas the sec-
ond is responsible for the additional isometries. The proof of completeness of
implementers can thereby be reduced to the case of endomorphisms which leave
the given Fock state invariant.

Implementability of Endomorphisms

Bogoliubov endomorphisms are the unital *–endomorphisms of C(K, γ) which
map K, viewed as a subspace of C(K, γ), into itself. They are completely deter-
mined by their restrictions to K which are called Bogoliubov operators. Hence
B(K) is a Bogoliubov operator if and only if it commutes with complex

S0(K, γ) is the group of Bogoliubov automorphisms (isomorphic to the sym-
plectic group of Re K). It acts on S(K, γ) by left multiplication. Analogous to
the CAR case, the orbits under this action are the subsets Sn(K, γ), and the
stabilizer of V

Sn(K, γ) is isomorphic to the symplectic group Sp(n).

We are interested in endomorphisms ̺V which can be implemented by
Hilbert spaces of isometries on Fs(K1). This means that there exist isometries

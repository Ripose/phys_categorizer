ABSTRACT 
 
We carried out a detailed and continuous paleomagnetic sampling of the reversed to normal 
geomagnetic transition recorded by some 60 consecutive flow units near the base of the Lesotho Basalt 
(183  ±  1  Ma).  After  alternating  field  or  thermal  cleaning  the  directions  of  remanence  are  generally  
well  clustered  within  flow  units.  In  contrast,  the  thermal  instability  of  the  samples  did  not  allow  to 
obtain  reliable  paleointensity  determinations.  The  geomagnetic  transition  is  incompletely  recorded 
due to a gap in volcanic activity attested both by eolian deposits and a large angular distance between 
the  field  directions  of  the  flows  underlying  or  overlying  these  deposits.  The  transition  path  is 
noticeably  different  from  that  reported  in  the  pioneer  work  of  van  Zijl  et  al.  (1962).  The  most 
transitional  Virtual  Geomagnetic  Poles  are  observed  after  the  volcanic  hiatus.  Once  continents  are 
replaced in their relative position 180 Ma ago, the post-hiatus VGP cluster over Russia. However, two 
successive  rebounds  from  that  cluster  are  found,  with  VGP  reaching  repeatedly  Eastern  Asia  coast. 
Thus,  the  VGP  path  is  not  narrowly  constrained  in  paleolongitude.  The  decrease  in  intensity  of 
magnetization as the field deviates from the normal or reversed direction suggests that the decrease in 
field  magnitude  during  the  reversal  reached  80-90%.  We  conclude  that  although  the  reversal  is  of  a 
dipole  of  much  weaker  moment  than  that  which  existed  on  average  during  Cenozoic  time,  the 
characteristics of the reversing geodynamo seem to be basically similar.

1. Introduction 
 
Brynjolfsson  (1957)  and  Sigurgeirsson  (1957)  were  probably  the  first  workers  to  report  the 
occurrence  of  lava  flows  with  intermediate  directions  of  remanence  between  two  volcanic 
magnetozones  of  opposite  polarity.  They  suggested  that  these  intermediate  directions,  observed  on 
Icelandic lava flows of Upper Cenozoic age, offer a record of the transitional state of the geomagnetic 
field  when  changing  from  one  polarity  state  to  the  other.  A  few  years  later,  from  an  extensive 
magnetic study of some 150 cores recovered along a 1,300 m thick section of the Early Jurassic Lesotho 
Basalt  (southern  Africa),  van  Zijl  et  al.  (1962a  and  b)  reported  an  impressive  line  of  observations  in 
favor  of  a  geomagnetic  origin  of  the  progressive  reversal  of  remanence  in  successive  lava  flows,  as 
opposed  to  the  self-reversal  mechanism  proposed  by  Néel  (1951,  1952).  In  the  Maseru  area,  these 
authors were able to describe a transition zone extending between 290 and 442m above the base of the 
lava  sequence  (Fig.  1)  between  underlying  reversed  flows  and  the  overlying normal ones. The most 
important observations of van Zijl et al. (1962a) in favor of the genuine character of field reversal were 
as  follows  :  (i)  baked  sediments  exhibit  the  same  remanence  direction  as  the  overlying  flow,  (ii) 
reversed  lava  flows  cut  by  normally  magnetized  dikes  become  normally  magnetized  as  one 
approaches  the  contact,  and  (iii)  lava  flows  and  sediments  as  well  acquire  a  TRM  parallel  to  the 

laboratory field direction whatever their NRM polarity. Moreover, in their second paper van Zijl et al. 
(1962b)  were  the  first  workers  to  try  to  determine  the  paleostrength  of  the  geomagnetic  field  while 
reversing.  Comparing  the  intensity  of  a  total  TRM  acquired  in  the  laboratory  to  that  of  NRM  (both 
partially demagnetized by AF), they concluded that the field intensity decreased by a factor of about 
four to five during the reversal. This total TRM paleointensity method is no longer in use because it 
offers  no  possibility  to  detect  the  changes  in  TRM  capacity  occurring  during  laboratory  heating  at 
high temperature (650°C in van Zijl et al.’s (1962b) experiments). 
 
The present study was undertaken with the aim of obtaining a more precise description of the 
Lesotho geomagnetic reversal. In the original study, not all the consecutive flows were sampled and 
only one (long) core was collected from each sampled flow. Apparently, this field reversal occurred 
during  a  period  of  long-term  dipole  low  (Prévot  et  al.,  1990;  Perrin  and  Shcherbakov,  1997). 
According to Kosterov et al. (1997) the average field intensity during Early Jurassic was only one half 
of  the  Late  Cenozoic  value.  While  there  are  several  well  documented  records  of  Upper  Cenozoic 
reversals  (Mankinen  et  al.,  1985;  Prévot  et  al.,  1985  a  and  b;  Chauvin  et  al.,  1990;  Kristjansson  et 
Sigurgeirsson,  1993;  Goguitchaichvili  et  al.,  1999 ;  Leonhardt  et  al.,  2002),  the  Lesotho  reversal  is  to 
date  the  only  detailed    volcanic  record  of  a  geomagnetic  transition  which  occurred  during  a  long 
period of dipole low. This gives a particular interest to this reversal, since it is not yet known whether 
the  characteristics  of  geomagnetic  reversals  depend  upon  the  magnetic  moment  of  the  dipole  field 
that existed during the preceding and following epochs of stable polarity.  
 
2. Sampling and laboratory procedures 
 

Geology and sampling 
The  Lesotho  Basalt  (Fig.  2)  is  part  of  the  widespread  volcanism  that  occurred  in  Southern 
Africa in Lower Jurassic times. Two sections were studied by van Zijl et al.  (1962a and b) : Bushmen's 
Pass  (near  Maseru)  and  Sani  Pass.  Because  the  later  section  is  more  weathered,  we  focussed  our 
efforts on the Bushmen's Pass section. In the course of a generalized sampling of the reverse zone, a 
few  flows  were  also  collected  near  Rhodes,  some  150  km  S  of  Bushmen's  Pass.  Four  of  these  flows 
were found to be transitional and the relevant data will be presented here. 
In the Maseru area, four sections (from bottom to top : Y, Z, X, and R) were sampled along or 
 
in  the  vicinity  of  the  road  going  up  from  Nazareth  to  Bushmen's  Pass  (Fig.  3).  These  sections 
stratigraphically  overlap  with  each  other.  Unambiguous  correlations  from  one  section  to  the  other 
could  be  made  between  flows  or  groups  of  flows  using  stratigraphic  evidences  and  directions  of 
remanence. Altogether, we think that our sampling was continuous between  2010m (base of Y)  and 
2350m (top of R). The successive flows were numbered upwards (Y7 to Y21; Z1 to Z10; X1 to X25; R1 
to  R12).  A  total  of  56  distinct  flows  (785  cores)  was  sampled  (4  to  8  cores  per  flow).  The  four 
transitional flows from the Rhodes area were collected at two sites within the bed of Bell river (lat. 30° 
45' 37" S and long. 28° 02' 47" E for RH4 and RH5; lat. 30° 45' 49" S and long. 28° 03' 22" E for RH7 and 
RH8, collected near Naude's Neck monument). 
 
Along  the  Bushmen's  Pass  composite  section,  the  average  flow  thickness  is  approximately  6 
m.  Individual  values  vary  from  1  to  20m.  Typically,  the  flow  base  is  characterized  by  vertically 
elongated  vesicles,  which  differ  markedly  from  the  more  spherical  or  horizontally  flattened  vesicles 
from  the  upper  parts  of  flows.  Ropy  flow  tops  were  occasionally  observed.  A  major  feature  of  the 
Lesotho  Basalt  sequence  is  the  occurrence  of  a  thin  sedimentary  level  within  the  geomagnetic 
transition zone (van Zijl et al., 1962a).  Along the Busmen's Pass sequence, a horizon of sedimentary 
lens,  each    up  to  1.5m  thick  and  several  meters  long,  was  observed  near  elevation  2160m.  We  were 
able  to  trace  this  discontinuous  sedimentary  layer  over  1km  along  the  Western  slope  of  the  Thaba-
Tseka mountain (Fig. 3). We will see below that this horizon corresponds to a distinctive break in the 
geomagnetic record. There is no evidence for a regional tilting of the lava pile (Hargraves et al., 1997). 
 
Fitch and Miller (1971, 1984) reported the first K-Ar and  39 Ar/  40 Ar of the Lesotho Basalt at 
Buhmen's Pass. They concluded that this lava section erupted very rapidly at some time close to 193 
Ma.  More  recent  39  Ar/  40  Ar  dating  (Duncan  et  al.,  1997),  once  recalculated  using  the  standard 
hornblende monitor Mmhb-1 (523.4 Ma, astronomically tuned), provides a mean age of 183 ± 1 Ma for 
the  Lesotho  formation  as  a  whole.  Paleomagnetic  data  are  compatible  with  an  extremely  rapid 
eruption of the total 1400m thick sequence. Considering that the reversal is recorded over a thickness 
of  some  150m  and  that  the  mean  duration  for  field  reversal  is  of  the  order  of  5,000-6,000  years 
(Kristjansson, 1985), the eruption of the Lesotho Basalt might have lasted for some  50,000 years or so.

Thus,  the  mean  age  of  the  lava  pile  is  also  the  best  radiometric  estimate  of  the  age  of  the  reversal, 
which has therefore to be considered as Toarcien. According to the geomagnetic reversal time scale of 
Gradstein et al. (1994), the Lesotho reversal might be either 182.4 or 183.2  Ma old. 
 
Laboratory procedures 

We first determined the two-week viscosity index (Thellier and Thellier, 1944; Prévot, 1981) of 
one  specimen  from  each  core,  with  the  exception  of  cores  from  X  section,  which  were  first 
magnetically  analyzed  at  the  Liverpool  laboratory.  Then  another  specimen  from  each  core  was 
progressively  demagnetized  by  alternating  fields.  Several  specimens  from  each  flow  were  also 
demagnetized  by  stepwise  heating  in  zero  field  in  air.  For  each  specimen,  the  direction  of  the 
characteristic  remanent  magnetization  (ChRM)  was  calculated  using  principal  component  analysis 
(Kirschvink,  1980).  A  few  flows  were  subjected  to  paleointensity  experiments  using  the  Thellier 
original  method  (Thellier  and  Thellier,  1959)  and  a  high  vacuum  furnace.  Unfortunately,  due  to  the 
poor magnetic stability of most of the Lesotho lava flows during heating (Kosterov and Prévot, 1998), 
no really reliable paleointensity data could be obtained. However, NRM(T) directions calculated from 
these  experiments  were  used  as  a  substitute  to  data  from  standard  thermal  cleaning  to  provide  the 
ChRM direction of the specimens studied for paleointensity purpose. This substitution is justified by 
the  absence  of  noticeable  CRM  acquisition  during  paleointensity  experiments  (Kosterov  and  Prévot, 
1998). 
 
2. Paleomagnetic characteristics of samples 
 
As  previously  observed  (Prévot,  1981),  the  magnetic  viscosity    index  v  does  not  show  a 
normal  distribution  (Fig.  4a)  but  rather  a  lognormal  one  (Fig.  4b).  The  mode  on  this  figure 
corresponds to v = 5%. Considering the age of the rocks, this is a rather weak value, in fact close to the 
average viscosity index found for subaerial lava flows of Upper Cenozoic age (Prévot, 1981). 
 
Examples  of  the  orthogonal  plots  obtained  from  either  AF  or  thermal  progressive 
demagnetization are given in Fig. 5. As a general rule, a quite simple magnetic behavior is observed in 
the  lowermost  (reversed)  and  the  uppermost  (normal)  lava  flows  (Fig.  5a).  With  the  exception  of  a 
small  VRM,  a  single  component  is  observed.  Thermal  and  AF  demagnetization  yield  the  same 
direction  of  ChRM  although  some  deflection  of  the  direction  can  be  sometimes  seen  on  the  AF 
diagrams when approaching a completely demagnetized state. 
 
For  the  median  part  of  the  composite  section,  the  behavior  of  the  samples  is  not  always  as 
straightforward. As shown by Fig. 5b, thermal cleaning appears more suitable than AF cleaning, even 
when the secondary component is small.  It can be inferred from Fig. 5c that most of the difficulties 
encountered  during  AF  cleaning  is  due  to  the  acquisition  of  some  parasitic  magnetization  (ARM  or 
RRM) which progressively deflects the direction of remanence. In such specimens, thermal cleaning is 
necessary  to  reach  an  approximately  zero-magnetization  state  in  the  specimen  (Fig.  5c,  specimen 
86P133A). 

Typically,  the  natural  secondary  components  remain  small  in  the  flows  from  the  transition 
zone  and  thermal  treatment  allows  a  precise  determination  of  ChRM  direction  (Fig.  5d,  specimen 
86P482B).  However,  a  few  samples  carry  a  quite  large  low  temperature  secondary  component, 
possibly of viscous origin for the example shown in Fig. 5d (specimen 86P128A). In a restricted area 
around Bushmen's Pass, corresponding to the uppermost flows of the X section (above X22), several 
cores  were  found  to  carry  a  large  IRM  (in  spite  of  the  precautions  taken  in  the  field  to  avoid  sites  
struck by lighting), which made it impossible to determine ChRM directions. 
The flow average direction was in general calculated from the combination of  the remanence 
 
directions  of  both  thermally  and  AF  cleaned  specimens.  Although  the  cleaning  range  used  for 
principal component analysis was variable from specimen to specimen, the ranges 400-550°C or 20-50 
mT are rather typical. The flow directions so obtained are listed in Table 1. The quality of the data is 
very  good  both  in  the  reversed  and  normal  zones  (almost  95%  of  sampling  sites  with  dispersion 
parameter  k>100)  but  only fairly good in the transition  zone (70% of sampling sites with dispersion 
parameter k>100). 
 
3. Description of the composite geomagnetic transition record 
 
Stratigraphic  observations  and  paleomagnetic  data  both  agree  that  the  four  sections  Y,  Z,  X 
and Z slightly overlap, which allows reconstruction without any gap of the paleomagnetic behavior

recorded  by  the  Bushmen’s  Pass  sequence.  The  composite  record  consists  of  36  “distinct” 
paleomagnetic    directions    (Table  2  and  Fig.  6)  distinguished  from  each  other  using  the  method  of 
Mankinen  et  al.  (1985).  Each  of  these  directions  defines  a  “paleomagnetic  unit”.  One  third  of  these 
paleomagnetic  units  are  defined  from  several  (up  to  six)  consecutive  lava  flows  yielding  the  same 
direction  (overlapping  α95  semi-angles)  called  “directional  flow  groups”  by  Mankinen  et  al.  (1985). 
The  limits  of  the  transition  zone  were  defined  from  the  reversal  angle  (Prévot  et  al.,  1985)  of  each 
paleomagnetic  unit.  The  reversal  angle  of  a  paleomagnetic  unit  is  the  angular  distance  between  the 
paleomagnetic  direction  of  this  unit  and  the  direction  of  either  the  normal  or  reversed  mean  field, 
whichever  is  closer.  The  beginning  (end)  of  the  transition  zone  was  chosen  as  corresponding  to  the 
first  (last)  flow  from  a  sequence  of  at  least  two  consecutive paleomagnetic units with reversal angle 
lying  outside  the  θ95  semi-angle  of  individual  directions.  Following  the  results  of  the  paleosecular 
variation  study  of  the  normal  and  reversed  magnetozones  of  the  Lesotho  Basalt  carried  out  by 
Kosterov and Perrin (1996), θ95 was taken equal to 24°. 
 
The transition path is obviously discontinuous. A large angular gap is observed at the level of 
the sedimentary lens (elevation 2155m) between directions 11 and 12.  This gap was first observed by 
Van Zijl (1962b) who also found it along the Sani Pass section, some 130 km East of Bushmen’s Pass. 
The sedimentary lenses display cross stratification of eolian origin. Obviously, the paleomagnetic gap 
is  due  to  a  pause  in  volcanic  activity.  None  of  the  transitional  directions  deviates  by  more  than  54° 
from the steady field direction (Table 2), which suggests that the volcanic pause was coincident with 
the  most  transitional  field  configurations.  The  directional  path  presently  obtained  (Fig.  6)  is  more 
detailed  and  presents  obvious  differences  from  that  reported  by  van  Zijl  et  al’s  (1962b).  These 
differences  result  probably  from  the  fact  that  this  pioneering  study  was  based  on  a  discontinuous 
sampling  of  the  flow  sequence,  with  generally  only  a  single  core  from  each  sampled  flow,  and  a 
moderate AF cleaning, sometimes insufficient to erase VRM or IRM due to lightning. Moreover, as we 
showed above, AF treatment of some samples can yield misleading results. The zigzag behavior of the 
transitional field directions described by these workers (Fig. 1) is not confirmed by our data. Instead, 
our record is compatible with rather gradual changes in direction during the two parts (pre and post 
gap) of the reversal. Furthermore, a rather complex pattern is observed during the final stages of the 
transition. 
 
The VGP positions (Table 2) were first calculated as usual with Africa in its present position, 
then  with  Africa  rotated  back  in  its  180  Ma  old  position  according  to  Morgan  (1983).  This 
paleoreconstruction  assumes  fixity  of  the  Atlantic  and  Indian  Ocean  hotspot  system  as  a  whole. 
Figure  7  represents  the  paleoVGP  path  of  the  Lesotho  reversal  onto  the  180  Ma  old  plate 
reconstruction proposed by Morgan (1983). The geographic paleopole used for that figure is the global 
paleomagnetic  pole  for  the  period  175-200  Ma  as  calculated  by  Prévot  et  al.  (2000)  from  a  selected 
dataset  of  paleomagnetic  data  from  all  continents  obtained  from  magmatic  rocks.    Most  of  the 
transitional  VGPs  plot  over  Russia.    However  two  successive  “rebounds”  (Watkins,  1969)  are 
observed with extreme VGP positions close to the margin of the Eurasia and Pacific plates. 
 
In  the  absence  of  direct  paleointensity  determinations,  we  tried  to  obtain  a  qualitative 
description of field paleostrength changes during this transition using cleaned remanence intensities 
as  a  proxy.  This  approach  was  already  used  by  several  authors  (Dagley  and  Wilson,  1971; 
Kristjansson, 1985; Chauvin et al., 1990; Camps and Prévot, 1996). In the case of the Lesotho Basalt, the 
use of this indirect method seems reasonable considering the petrographic monotony of this volcanic 
suite  (Cox,  1988)  and  the  relative  weakness  of  secondary  magnetization’s  as  compared  to  ChRM  in 
most  of  the  rock  samples.  Moreover,  rather  than  using  NRM  intensity,  we  used  the  remanence 
intensity  after  cleaning  either  by  a  10  mT  alternating  field  or  heating  at  200°C.  A  decrease  in 
remanence  intensity  is  observed  in  the  transition  zone  (Fig.  8),  in  qualitative  agreement  with  the 
paleointensity  results  of  van  Zijl  et  al.  (1962b) who suggested a four to five-fold diminution in field 
intensity.  A  more  representative  estimate  of  the  specific  magnetization  decrease  can  be  obtained  by 
calculating the average magnetization intensity versus consecutive reversal angle intervals (Fig. 9). A 
rapid  decrease  is  observed  as  soon  as  the  reversal  angle  starts  increasing.  For  reversal  angles 
exceeding  20°  the  remanence  intensity  is  reduced  to  approximately  15%  of  the  value  found  for  the 
directions laying within a 10° radius cone from the average steady field direction.

4. Discussion and conclusions 
  
The  present  data  confirm  the  suggestion  of  van  Zijl  et  al  (1962b)  that,  due  to  a  pause  in 
volcanic  activity  that  occurred  apparently  just  during  the  most  transitional  stages,  the  Lesotho 
reversal is incompletely recorded. No  VGP very close to paleoequator is observed. Considering that 
the global paleopole is located at latitude 69.1 and longitude 311.4 for the period 175-200 Ma (Prévot 
et al., 2000), the lowest paleolatitude of transitional VGP is 20° (unit 21, Fig. 7). The fluctuations of the 
transitional field directions documented by the present study are however quite different from those 
reported  by  van  Zijl  et  al  (1962b).  Also,  they  seem  to  have  been  rather  gradual,  with  no  compelling 
evidence in favor of the “jerky” behavior of the geomagnetic field advocated by those workers. 
 
Both  before  and  during  the  Lesotho  reversal,  several  “directional  flow  groups”  -  each 
constituted  of  consecutive  flows  exhibiting    the  same  direction  (within  experimental  uncertainties)  - 
are found. Such directional flow groups are of rather common occurrence in volcanic sequences (e.g. 
Mankinen et al., 1985; Hoffman, 1991; Mc Elhinny et al., 1996; Széréméta et al., 1999). In the case of the 
Lesotho sequence, such groups comprise up to 6 consecutive flows (direction 2) but, more commonly, 
only 3 to 5 (directions 5, 11, 22, 29). Directional groups can be interpreted either as multiple records of 
a  single  direction  of  a  constantly  changing  geomagnetic  field  that  are  due  to  a  brief  outburst  of 
volcanic activity (Mankinen et al., 1985) or as reflecting a standstill of the geomagnetic field direction 
(Hoffman,  1991).  The  first  interpretation  is  supported  by  many  observations  on  present  volcanoes. 
However,  the  second  interpretation  can  be  preferred  when  significant  changes  in  field  paleostrenth 
are  observed  within  a  single  directional  group  (Prévot  et  al.,  1985b)  or,  alternatively,  when 
stratigraphically  distinct  directional  flow  groups  recurrently  record  a  similar  field  direction.  Such  a 
case can be observed in the detailed record of the reversal found at Steens Mountain (Mankinen et al. 
1985;  Camps  et  al.,  1999)  in  which  directional  flow  groups  21  (3  consecutive  flows)  and  31  (7 
consecutive  flows)  do  yield  the  same  transitional  direction.  Recently,  a  similar  field  recurrence  was 
reported from another volcanic record of a mid-Miocene geomagnetic reversal found in Gran Canaria 
(Leonhart  et  al.,  2002).  In  contrast,  the  transitional  directions  carried  by  the  flow  groups  from  the 
Lesotho  record  are  all  different  from  each  other.  Given  the  absence  of  recurrent  paleomagnetic 
direction,  we  consider  that  these  groups  of  flows  are  probably  due  to  intense  outpouring  of  several 
lava flows in a short interval of time rather than to successive standstills of the geomagnetic field. 

Two  successive  N-I-N  rebounds  of  the  geomagnetic  field  towards  intermediate  VGPs  are 
observed  during  the  last  stage  of  the  Lesotho  reversal  after  a  first  reestablishing  of  normal  polarity 
(Fig. 7). Rebounds are commonly observed in detailed Cenozoic records of reversals (Mankinen et al, 
1985; Chauvin et al., 1990; Kristjansson et Sigurgeirsson, 1993; Leonhardt et al., 2002). Paleomagnetic 
records of Cenozoic reversals obtained from sedimentary rocks indicate that transitional poles  tend to 
fall along two longitude bands centered on America or Asia/Pacific boundary (Tric et al., 1991 ; Laj et 
al., 1991). The significance of this pattern is unclear. If not weighted, transitional poles from volcanic 
rocks  from  the  past  16  Ma  show  no  evidence  for any  longitudinal  organization  (Prévot  and  Camps,  
1993).  However, using debatable methods of normalization and weighting,  Love (1998) observed a 
maximum  in  VGP  longitude  distribution  between  60  and  90°E  (Eastern  Asia).  Intriguingly,  the 
rebound VGPs of the Lesotho reversal fall along the boundary between the Eurasia and Pacific plates. 
However, in the absence of other data from geomagnetic reversals with appropriate dates, we do not 
know if this observation is representative for the Jurassic. 

The  regularity  of  the  decrease  in  averaged  specific  magnetization  as  the  transitional  field 
deviates  from  the  normal/reverse  field  direction  (Fig.  9)  strongly  suggests  that  this  diminution  
reflects a progressive decrease of the geomagnetic paleostrength. Quite similar trends were reported 
from Cenozoic volcanic sequences in Iceland (Kristjansson, 1985) and Polynesia (Chauvin et al., 1990). 
Such trends are well  fitted by a statistical model of the geomagnetic field in which the fluctuations of 
the non-axial dipole components are isotropic and independent from those of the axial dipole (Camps 
and Prévot, 1996). The trend in magnetization magnitude versus reversal angle (Fig. 9) suggests that 
the  maximum  decrease  in  the  paleofield  intensity  might  have  reached  80-90%  during  the  Lesotho 
reversal,  which  is  comparable  with  the  result  obtained  from  direct  paleointensity  measurements  for 
the well documented Cenozoic Steens Mountain reversal (Prévot et al., 1985 b). Taking into account 
the  weakness  of  the  local  steady  paleofied  in  Early  Jurassic  (24  ±  11µT    according  to  Kosterov  and 
Perrin,  1997),  the  predicted  transitional  field  intensity    would  have  been  particularly  low.  The 
variation  of  the  averaged  specific  magnetization  as  the  field  reverses  (Fig.  8)  suggests    some 
asymmetry  in  the  change  in  field  magnitude  from  the  pre  to  the  post-transitional  stages.  A  similar

behavior  is  well  substantiated  by  direct  paleostrength  determinations  on  several  Cenozoic 
geomagnetic reversals (Prévot et al., 1985 b; Bogue and Paul, 1993; Quideller and Valet, 1996; Riisager 
and Abrahamsen, 2000). 

Thus,  although  the  paleomagnetic  data  for  the  Lesotho  reversal  are  not  as  complete  and 
accurate  as  for  more  recent  reversals,  they  support  the  contention  that  the  characteristics  of 
geomagnetic  reversals  were  similar  in  Late  Cenozoic  and  Early  Jurassic  times.  While  the  long-term 
averaged dipole moment of the Earth appears to have been twice weaker during Early Jurassic than 
during  Late  Cenozoic  (Prévot  et  al.,  1990;  Perrin  and  Shcherbakov,  1997;  Kosterov  et  al.,  1997),  the 
reversal process seems to have been basically unchanged.

been  rotated  according  to  the  180  Ma  old  plate  reconstruction  proposed  by  Morgan  (1983).  The 
paleogeographic reference frame is pinned to the global paleopole position for the period 175-200Ma 
(Prévot  et  al.,  2000).  Star  show  the  rotated  position  of  the  local  paleomagnetic  pole  obtained  by 
Kosterov and Perrin (1996) from normal and reversed sequences from the Lesotho Basalt. Projection 
poles are (30°N, 60°E) for the Northern hemisphere and (45°S, 240°E) for the Southern hemisphere.

Table 2. Average ChRM directions and VGP coordinates (PLA, PLO) of consecutive paleomagnetic units numbered from 1 (lowermost unit) to 36 (uppermost 
unit). Symbols are similar to those of Table 1 with in addition the reversal angle δ (Prévot et al., 1985b) in degrees, and the VGP paleogeographic coordinates, 
paleolatitude (PPLA) and paleolongitude (PPLO), calculated from the position of the African plate 180 Ma ago according to Morgan (1983) and the global 
paleopole position calculated by Prévot et al. (2000) for the period 175-200 Ma.

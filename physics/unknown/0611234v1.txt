1 Abstract 
It is considered that the time derivative of the electric intensity in the Maxwell-Ampere law 
(displacement current) denotes that a change of electric field generates a magnetic field. This 
paper shows that there is no reason think a change of electric field generates a magnetic field 
and the displacement current term has different meaning – it is necessary to be aware of 
distant conductors and their magnetic fields.

It is not too clear why there is the term 

 (displacement current) in the Maxwell-Ampere 

. There is no problem with the part

school-book is written: „Displacement current in a vacuum is the first of quantities we have 
no mechanical analogy for.“ Also Wikipedie thinks displacement current in a vacuum is a 
physical phenomenon: „The first part is present everywhere, even in a vacuum; it does not 
involve any actual movement of charge, but still has an associated magnetic field, as if it were 
an actual current.“ And all teachers I know say the same.  
The intension of this paper is to show that displacement current in a vacuum creating 

 that is present even in a vacuum. In my 

magnetic field is not necessary to explain the term 

 in the Maxwell-Ampere law. It is

sufficient to consider only the magnetic field created by conductors and the term

 only 

informs us about currents that are far from the place where the magnetic field is measured. 

3 Maxwell-Ampere law 

Now we will try to derive the Maxwell-Ampere law and show we need the term 

0e

 in it 

even though only the magnetic field from conductors is considered. We will assume that 
changes of currents and fields are slow and the environment is a vacuum, so 
 and

3.1 Infinitely long direct conductor 
Let’s have an infinitely long direct conductor with a constant current I and an area A with its 
boundary  A¶

universally. It works only for an infinitely long direct conductor. 

. However, this relation cannot be used 

3.2 Discontinuous conductor 
Now we will try to mystify our equation from the chapter 3.1. We will assume the same 
configuration but the conductor will be cut off along the area A. The cut will be very narrow, 
so it will form a capacitor (see Fig.2). 

Fig. 2 

For the electric field in the cut we can write 
rr
sdH

Now we can ask whether our equation  (cid:242)

 is still valid. Value of the left side of 

the equation has not changed because the magnetic field stays the same (the cut is very 
narrow). Conversely, the value of the right side of the equation is now 0 since no current 
flows through the area A. However, we have electric field in the cut instead of the current. 

Therefore, we will add the term 

 that shows there is some current near that creates 

magnetic field. The equation will be

Now we have the final version of the Maxwell-Ampere law but only for an infinitely long 
direct conductor (possibly discontinuous). It is necessary to show that the equation is valid for

any configuration of conductors. To do this (using the superposition principle) it is sufficient 
to show that Maxwell-Ampere law is valid around a very short (elementary) conductor 
because any configuration can be assembled from very short conductors and very long direct 
conductors. We will show this in the next chapter. 

3.3 Very short conductor 
Since we can use any coordinate system we will assume there is a very short conductor of the 
length l in the origin oriented along the z-axis. Current I flows through the conductor. Let’s 
assign 

 the length and orientation of the conductor. At both the ends of the conductor

4 Conclusion

It has been shown that in a vacuum stands 

 (the Maxwell-Ampere law). We 

considered only the magnetic field created by conductors accordingly to Biot-Savart-Laplace 
law. We did not consider that a change of electric field generates magnetic field. So the 

existence of the term 

0e

 in the Maxwell-Ampere law does not denote any new physical 

phenomenon (e.g. vacuum polarization) and there is no reason to think that a change of 
electrical intensity generates magnetic field.

Abstract

Single-shot ultrafast absorbance spectroscopy based on the frequency encoding of the
kinetics  is  analyzed  theoretically  and  implemented  experimentally.  In  Part  II  of  the  series,
arbitrary thickness sample is analysed theroretically. The model is then used to simulate the
results for a-Si:H films.

Appendix 1. Arbitrary thickness sample on a clear substrate.

In  this  Appendix,  we  examine  a  general  case  of  the  probe  light  propagating
through a thin sample. Without loss of generality, we will assume that the sample is a flat
layer of thickness d with a complex dielectric function  εω
ω= n2  on a thick, non-absorbing
substrate with index of refraction ns. The propagation of light through the sample in the
direction normal to the surface is given by a wave equation

where  z  is  the  depth  of  the  sample  (z=0  for  the  air/sample  interface  and  z=d for the
sample/substrate interface) and ∆ε(t) is the perturbation of the dielectric function by the
pump light. We will assume that this perturbation is independent of z, i.e., the pump light
is  absorbed  homogeneously  throughout  the  sample  (if  the  energy  deposition  is  z-
dependent, even the PPS experiment becomes difficult to analyze rigorously, see refs. 24
and 1S). To solve eq. (A1) we will use first order perturbation theory and assume that

For single exponential kinetics, the integral in eq. (A21) is equal to the function Φ(α,β,γ)
given  by  eq.  (14).  In  particular,  for  long  group  delays  Te,  the  integral  in  eq.  (A21)
asymptotically approaches exp(-γTe) (this applies to the samples of any thickness, since
for long Te, a very narrow interval of frequencies Ω  close to ω contributes to the integral

(Note that for a thin wedge this expression should be divided by nω). In the general case,
formula  (A21)  is  incorrect  and  eqs.  (A18)  and  (A19)  must  be  used  instead.  The
integration  can  be  preformed  numerically  or  by  expansion  of  the  Fresnel  coefficients
given by eq. (A7) (that are periodic functions of ω) into a truncated Fourier series and
integrating  each  term  analytically,  using  a  modified  eq.  (14).  In  most  experimental
situations, the second term in eq. (A19) is 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than the first
term and thereby may be neglected. Note that the expression for S(ω) given by eq. (A18)
is for infinite spectral resolution. For δτp << 1 (which is always the case experimentally),

We turn now to the thin-film a-Si:H sample examined in section 5.2. From the
existing data on the refraction and absorption in a-Si:H, we may safely assume that nω

(φε=900), function T(ω) has the same extrema as the sample transmission T
pure photorefraction (φε=00), T(ω) has  zeroes at the transmission extrema and maxima

has  a  maximum  exactly  at  the  center  frequency  ω0  of  the  probe  pulse,  and  the  fringe
period is close to the FWHM of this pulse. The calculation indicates that the phase of the

complex  factor  t
center (where the transmission is minimum) to ±65o at the limits of the optimum spectral
range (where the reflection has extrema). Cursory examination of eq. (A21) and Fig. 5
suggests that the oscillation pattern of S(ω) should change with the pump delay T since
the  kinetic  origin  ∆ω
  moves  relative  to  the  fringe  pattern  and  this
(
changes  the  phase  of  the  complex  factor  t

pattern barely changes when the kinetic origin is swept across the spectrum. We argue
that eq. (A21) is incorrect when the fringe spacing is comparable to 1/τp. General eqs.

the first pair of crests is just 4.5% and 9.1%, respectively, lower than the same spacing

A  PPS  measurement  of  ∆εω(t)  becomes  quite  complicated  when  the  sample
exhibits  well-resolved  interference  fringes  near  the  probe  wavelength.  24,31,1S   Such  a
situation frequently occurs in studies of thin films.  1S  In  this  case,  the  complex  factor
− (
 in eq. (7) oscillates with  ω, and in order to extract ∆εω(t) one needs to (i)

determine  this  factor  in  a  separate  experiment,  (ii)  measure  transient  reflection  of  the
sample in addition to the transmission, and (iii) invert linear equations that express these
two signals vs. ∆ε′ω(t) and ∆ε″ω(t). 1S  Involved  as  it  is,  this  procedure  (known  as  the
"inversion method")  1S  is  insufficient  to  obtain  ∆ε′ω(t)  near  the  fringe  extrema,  where
dω ε = 0 . On the other hand, precisely due to the latter equation, ∆ε″ω(t) can be
Im 
determined  from  a  single  transmission  measurement  near  the  fringe  extrema,  even  if
∆ε′ω(t) is large, provided that the fringe spacing is much greater than the spectral width of
the  probe  pulse,  1 /τp.  24,1S    The  retrieval  of  ∆εω(t)  is  further  complicated  by
inhomogeneous  absorption  of  the  pump  that  changes  the  inversion  matrix.  Moon  and
Tauc 1S  found that this method completely breaks down for large photoinduced signals
(>0.01). Even when the signals are weak, the results are very sensitive to small errors in

relies on several independent measurements.

For this demonstration we have chosen amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H)
which is a commercial thin-film material for solar energy conversion. 31  This material has
an optical gap 1.75 eV and is transparent at our probe wavelength, 800 nm. The dynamics
of photoinduced free carriers and trapped charges in a-Si:H has been extensively studied
(see reviews in refs. 24, 31, and 2S). Upon short-pulse excitation with < 600 nm photons,
free  carries  are  injected  in  their  respective  bands.  These  carriers  thermalize,  3S,4S
recombine with each other (with rate constant of 2.3x10-8 cm3/s) 24,2S,3S and descend into
shallow (60-100 meV) traps (~1020 cm-3) with rate constant of (1-2)x10-8 cm3/s. 24,5S  The
scattering time of the plasma is very short,  ≈0.5 fs, 31,2S  and no TA signal from the free
carriers was observed in the vis and NIR for carrier density < 1019-1020 cm-3. 24,2S,3S,5S  For
the initial carrier densities of 1017-1018  cm-3,  the  TA  signal  is  dominated  by  band-tail
charges that slowly recombine (with rate constant of 6x10-9 cm3/s),  24 by hopping and
thermal emission, and descend into < 1017 cm-3 of deep traps (such as dangling Si bonds).
24,31,1S,5S The intraband absorption of these trapped charges is a smooth, featureless curve
that gradually ascends from the vis into the NIR.  5S  At  low  carrier  density,  the  decay
kinetics of ∆ε′ω(t) and ∆ε′ω(t) are slow (lasting into hundreds of ps) and dispersive. 24,1S,5S
∆ε′ω(t) is negative, and the initial phase (for t<100 ps) is close to 107o (at 1033 nm). 5S

Fig. 12S shows PPS kinetics obtained for 400 nm excitation of a d=1.4 µm thick
film of undoped a-Si:H. At this excitation energy, the pump light is absorbed in 30 nm
near the surface, resulting in high initial density (>1019 cm-3 for our pump intensities) and
considerable excess energy (1.35 eV) of the photocarriers. The center frequency ω0 of the
probe pulse, 800 nm, is matched with the transmission maximum at 796 nm, so the ∆OD

6S.

signal is dominated by photoinduced absorbance. The short-lived "spike" (< 5 ps) has
nearly the same decay profile as the (positive) ∆ε′ω(t) and (negative) ∆ε″ω(t) in the 310
nm pump - 310 nm probe experiment by Wraback et al.  4S  Similar PPS kinetics with a
life  time  of  1.5  ps  for  the  spike  were  observed  in  a  400  nm  pump  -  2.86  µm  probe
experiment at Argonne (unpublished). Tauc et al. 31,4S give an estimate of 2 eV/ps for the
rate of carrier relaxation in a-Si:H, which gives 1.5 ps for thermalization time after 400
nm photoexcitation. The decay rate of the "spike" changes with the pump intensity, and
the kinetics can be interpreted in terms of a monoexponential process with time constant
of  ≈2  ps  (that  Wraback  et  al.  4S associate  with  carrier  relaxation)  and  a  bimolecular
process with rate constant of 4x10-10 cm3/s (presumably, due to recombination of these
"hot" carriers). For t>5 ps, the kinetics show slow decay over > 1 ns; with only a few per
cent drop in ∆OD over the first 50 ps after the 400 nm pulse (i.e., one expects to observe
perfectly  flat  picosecond  FDSS  kinetics).  Such  dispersive  kinetics  are  typical  for
amorphous semiconductors: one can readily find a time window where the kinetics are
nearly  flat.  Thus,  for  a  suitably  long  pump  delay,  the  wavelength  dependence  of  the

In Figs 13S and 14S(a), FDSS kinetics for the same a-Si:H sample are given at
several delay times T of the pump pulse and two stretch factors, s=-630 (τ

fs
and s=-3,780 (τ
). In Fig. 13S(b), T=0 ps and T=9 ps kinetics obtained for s=-
630  (shown  in  Fig.  13S(a))  were  normalized  by  the  T=300  ps  kinetics  [that  yield  the
spectral  profile  of T(ω)].  These  normalized  kinetics  are  flat  after  the  first  few  ps,
suggesting  that  the  normalization  procedure  succeeds  in  compensating  for  the  curved
transmission profile. In Fig. 14(b), trace (i) the two oscillation patterns are juxtaposed in
time (given in the units of  τ
GVD). In the frequency domain, T=0 ps corresponds to the
time  origin  placed  at  the  transmittance  maximum  whereas  T=9  ps  corresponds  to  this
origin placed at the reflectance maximum (Fig. 13S(b)). Despite a considerable change in

 for these two positions, the two oscillation

patterns are almost exactly the same, validating the theoretical analysis given at the end
of Appendix 1. The same applies to the kinetic traces obtained for a greater compression
factor (Fig. 14S(a) and Fig. 14S(b), trace (ii)).

We conclude that for thin-film samples that exhibit closely spaced interference
fringes (comparable to the spectral width of a femtosecond probe pulse), meaningful "TA
ωT
kinetics" can still be obtained from the FDSS traces simply by doing the  S(

normalization. These reconstructed kinetics are unique in the sense that their oscillation
patterns and overall shape do not change with the position of the probe band with respect
to the fringe pattern. Like the PPS kinetic traces in such a situation, these "TA kinetics"
are a combination of transient absorption and reflection kinetics averaged over the probe

thick polycrystalline ZnSe sample (detected with a transform limited 30 fs FWHM, 800
nm probe pulse). The line drawn through the points is a biexponential fit (see the text).
The fast (14 ps) component corresponds to the free carrier trapping; the slow (910 ps)
component  corresponds  to  the  recombination  of  trapped  charges.  Nearly  80%  of  this
“absorbance” signal is due to the negative change in the refraction index due to the free
carriers.  (b)  A  family  of  512-channel  FDSS  kinetics  obtained  from  the  same  sample
under  identical  excitation  conditions.  In  this  particular  run,  the  compression  factor  is
2,048 and τGVD is 905 fs (so that 1 ps is equivalent to 6 cm-1); the whole kinetics covers
530 cm-1. Each FDSS kinetics is the average of 150K shots. Filled circles indicate the
T=30 ps trace that was used to determine the spectral response of the sample; the solid
line drawn through the signal was polynomially smoothed and used to normalize other
FDSS kinetics. The resulting normalized kinetic traces are shown in Fig. 9. The premise
of this normalization procedure is that the T=30 ps kinetics are flat; this approximation is
justified  by  the  PPS  kinetics  given  above.  Similar  normalization  was  done  for  other
systems too.

(a)  Pump-probe  TA  of  hydrated  electrons  observed  at  the  delay  time  of  7  ps  (filled
circles) and 400 ps (empty squares) upon 400 nm photoexcitation of 75 mM aqueous KI
in a 150 µm optical path high-speed jet (double logarithmical plot). The beam radii of the
400  nm  (τL=200  fs)  pump  and  800  nm  (τp=20  fs)  probe  were  35  and  19.5  µm,
respectively. Upon the photoexcitation, iodide donates the electron to water; the resulting
electron fully thermalizes and localizes within 2 ps (so that the 7 ps measurement gives
the  initial  yield  of  thermalized  electrons).  The  geminate  pair  of  the  electron  and  the
residual iodine atom slowly recombine on the sub-ns time scale; the 400 ps absorbance
gives an estimate for the escape yield of these hydrated electrons. For pump irradiance <
0.3  TW/cm2,  both  absorbance  signals  increase  as  the  second  power  of  the  irradiance
(solid lines with the slopes of 2±0.04 and 1.94±0.04 for 7 and 400 ps, respectively), as
expected  for  a  biphotonic  process;  the  fraction  of  electrons  that  escape  the  geminate
recombination  does  not  change  with  the  pump  irradiance.  For  pump  irradiance  >  1
TW/cm2,  the  electron  yield  increases  linearly  with  the  irradiance.  As  the  irradiance
increases, the absorbance signals at 7 and 400 ps first get closer, indicating less efficient
geminate recombination, then diverge again, signaling the onset of cross-recombination
(the inset). The change in the kinetics is illustrated in (b) for traces (i) (to the left) and (ii)
(to the right) that were obtained at 0.22 and 1.91 TW/cm2, respectively. The vertical bars
give  95%  confidence  limits;  the  solid  lines  are  biexponential  fits.  Slower  geminate
recombination at the higher pump irradiance is indicative of the “2+1” photoprocess in
which the extra 400 nm photon is absorbed by pre-thermalized electron that is thereby
excited deep into the conduction band and localized away from the iodine atom (see the
text).

(a) A PPS kinetics obtained for 400 nm excitation of 75 mM aqueous iodide flowing in a
5 mm optical path cell. The TA signal is detected using an 800 nm, 33 fs (trace (i), filled
squares) and 4 ps (trace (ii), filled circles) FWHM probe. The pump irradiance was < 0.1
TW/cm2,  i.e.,  these  kinetics  were  obtained  in  the  2-photon  excitation  regime  (see  the
legend to Fig. 5S). (b) A family of FDSS kinetics obtained for the same system (τGVD=
890  fs,  1  ps  =  5.6  cm-1). The delay times T  of  the  pump  are  given  in  the  legend;  the
kinetics  were  normalized  by  the  T=260  ps  trace  to  correct  for  the  nonflat  spectral
response. Arrows indicate the “spike” on the rising edge of the FDSS kinetics due to the
rapid swing of the phase of dielectric function in the course of electron thermalization
(see Fig. 10 and 9S and the discussion in section V.2).

(a) The data of Fig. 6S(b) replotted on an “absolute” time scale (with the “delay time”

Normalized FDSS kinetics obtained from 75 mM aqueous KI flowing in a 150 µm jet;
similar  excitation  conditions  to  those  specified  in  Fig.  5S(b).    The  400  nm  pump
irradiance (TW/cm2) and the maximum ∆OD at 800 nm were, respectively (i) 0.72 and
0.043, (ii) 1.4 and 0.147, and (iii) 2.43 and 0.3. These kinetics were obtained for GVD of
–1.58 ps2 (τGVD=1.26 ps; 1 ps = 3.36 cm-1); 75K pump on - pump off shots were averaged
for  each  kinetic  trace.  As  the  irradiance  increases,  the  decay  kinetics  of  the  hydrated
electron  become  flatter  (compare  with  the  PPS  kinetics  given  in  Fig.  5S(b))  and  the
amplitude of the oscillations becomes smaller.

(a) A typical power dependence of the hydrated electron yield in 400 nm photoionization
of neat liquid water (150 µm thick jet) observed via the PPS-detected electron absorbance
at  800  nm,  ca.  16  ps  after  the  200  fs  FWHM  excitation  pulse  (at  which  time  the
thermalization  is  complete).  The  pump  and  probe  beam  radii  are  56  and  14  µm,
respectively. At low irradiance (< 0.5 TW/cm2), the ionization is 3-photon and results in
the  geminate  decay  kinetics  for  which  the  escape  yield  of  the  electron  is  ca.  72%.  At
higher  irradiance,  the  yield  linearly  increases  with  the  pump  power,  indicating  the
occurrence  of  the  “3+1”  excitation  process.  Simultaneously,  the  time  profile  of  the
kinetics changes so that the escape yield approaches > 90%. (b) TA kinetics obtained in
the  “3+1”  regime  (for  80  µJ  pump  pulse).  The  decay  is  second  order  (solid  line)  and
originates mainly through the cross-recombination of the electrons and hydroxyl radicals
(that occurs with a rate constant of 3x1010 M-1 s-1). The path-average concentration of the
electrons is 1.6 mM, which gives a time constant of 21 ns; the observed time constant is
higher, ca. 5 ns, due to the extremely non-homogeneous excitation profile for the “3+1”
photoprocess. The vertical bars are 95% confidence limits.

(a) Normalized FDSS kinetics obtained for 3 x 400 nm photon excitation of N2-saturated
liquid  water  flowing  in  a  high-speed  jet  (solid  line).  Filled  circles  indicate  the  pump
probe kinetics obtained under the same excitation conditions (vertical bars indicate 95%
confidence limits). The maximum ∆OD is ca. 1x10-2; see the text for other parameters.
An arrow indicates the “spike” that is quite analogous to the same “spike” in the FDSS
kinetics obtained for iodide CTTS (e.g., Fig. 6S). (b) Power dependence for normalized
FDSS kinetics obtained under the same “3+1” excitation conditions as the PPS kinetics
shown in Fig. 10S(b). The pump power and the maximum ∆OD were (i) 27 µJ and 0.017,
(ii) 49 µJ and 0.2, and (iii) 94 µJ and 0.394, respectively. Note the drastic reduction in the
oscillation amplitude at the higher optical density. The FDSS kinetics were obtained for

12S.

τGVD=1.21 ps (1 ps = 3.6 cm-1) with a compressed 33 fs FWHM probe pulse. Traces (i),
(ii), and (iii) are the averages of 30K, 45K, and 100K shots, respectively.

Pump-probe kinetics observed upon the 400 nm excitation of 1.4 µm film of amorphous
hydrogenated silicon on a suprasil substrate (801.3 nm detection). The pump power was
(i)  9  and  (ii)  43  µJ.  After  the  initial  rapid  decay  (in  3  ps),  a  slower  decay  due  to  the
recombination of trapped charges in the bulk is observed. The 33 fs FWHM probe pulse
is centered at the transmission extremum (see Fig. 13S) and has a band pass similar to the
fringe spacing. Note the flatness of the decay kinetics for t>10 ps at the lower excitation
power.

(a) FDSS “kinetics” for the a-Si:H system (see the previous caption) plotted as a function
of ∆ω. These kinetics were obtained with a 400 nm pulse of 19 µJ and T=0 (ii) and +9 ps
(i), respectively. The stretch factor for a 33 fs FWHM probe pulse is -627, τGVD=528 fs (1
ps = 19 cm-1). The spectral response (iii) was obtained from a T=300 ps trace. (b) The

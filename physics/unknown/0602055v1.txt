Abstract  
 
Predicting absolute magnitude of fluctuations of price, even if their sign remains unknown, is 
important  for  risk  analysis  and  for  option  prices.  In  the  present  work,  we  display  our 
predictions  about  absolute  magnitude  of  daily  fluctuations  of  the  Dow  Jones  Industrials 
Average (DJIA), utilizing the original theory of conservation of total energy, for the coming 
500 days. 
 
Introduction 
 
One may define total energy (ET) for prices χ(t) (taking mass equal to unity) as  
 

ET= ½ v2 + U ,

where v is the usual speed, i.e., v(t)=dχ(t)/dt, and U is the potential energy. In literature a few 
number  of  references,  which  utilize  the  idea  of  potential  energy  is  found  [1-10].  J-P. 
Bouchaud, and R. Cont  [1] developed a quadratic form within  a Langevin approach, and in 
[2],  J-P.  Bouchaud  studied  a  more  complex  expression  involving  a  term  with  power  three 
besides a quadratic one. In [3, 4] a potential energy corresponding to some states of random 
motion  is  phrased.  An  angle  dependent  potential  is  utilized  to  describe  equilibrium  and  off 
equilibrium  price  states  in  [5].  K.  Ide  and  D.  Sornette  studied  oscillatory  finite-time 
singularities  in  finance  [6,  7],  where  the  time  derivative  of  speed  was  written  in  terms  of  a 

and v

n 
, with arbitrary powers (See Eqs. (11)-(13), (32), (33), in [6], 
linear combination of χ
and Eqs. (1)-(3) in [7].) There, no assumption about the conservation of the sum of kinetic and 
potential  energies  was  made.  They  have  obtained  oscillations  and  up  (down)  trends  by 
neglecting the speed and restoring terms, respectively. Recently, we described some aspects 
of  potential  energy  for  price  oscillations  in  [8],  in  terms  of  buying  and  selling  processes 
within a herding mechanism. More recently, we proposed and utilized conservation of sum of 
potential and kinetic energy to make some predictions on several world indices [9, 10], where 
a linear potential energy (U=gχ) was also proposed for the current epoch of DJIA, S&P500, 
and  NASDAQ.  The  corresponding  equations  of  motion  (obtained  by  taking  the  time  time 
derivative of Eq. (1) and equating it to zero as d2χ(t)/dt2 = -g, and integrating afterwards)

survived as valid for the behavior of the DJIA, S&P500, and NASDAQ[8,10], within the last 
nine months after we proposed it, as shown for DJIA in Fig. 1. Unit for price (value) is taken 
as local currency unit (lcu), and for time as (day). 
 
   In  the  present  work  DJIA  will  be  focused  on,  because  its  time  domain  is  the  longest  and 
volume is largest of all the world indices. One may see Fig. 1. and its caption for the explicit 
form  of  Eq.  (2)  and  the  parameters  therein,  where  (and  in  other  related  figures  and 
computations) real data in [11] is utilized up to 30 Dec 2005. 
 
 
Conservation of total energy and predicting daily fluctuations for future 
 
As  shown  empirically  in  [10],  the  general  trends  averaged  over  months  or  years  gave  a 
roughly conserved total energy. The corresponding equation of motion for the current epoch, 
Eq. (2), may be decorated for future’s probable behavior of the price as 
 

χfuture(t) = χ(t) (1 – α(0.5-δ(t))   ,

where χ(t) is the expression in Eq (2), and δ(t) is the random function with  0≤δ(t)<1. In Eq(4) 
α is any scaling factor, which controls the maximum value of deviation of the probable future 
value of the index from Eq. (2), where the shape remains independent of α. In reality α may 
also depend on the regulations of the exchange, since in some countries arbitrary fluctuations 
are not allowed and limited by law. α maybe taken as 0.3 for DJIA for reasonable results with 
±15% daily variations (probable) at maximum. It is clear that perfection can never be reached 
with  any  prediction,  yet  one  may 
try  better  randomization  processes  for  better 
approximations. Utilizing Eq.  (9) of [8], we  obtained  the  results displayed in  Figs. 2. a., b., 
where the initial date (i.e. the first day) is taken as 02 Jan 1998. In the upper part of Fig. 2. b., 
the original (one of the probable) results are displayed with a shifted vertical axis, in order to 
seperate the upper curve from the lower one. In the lower curve of Fig. 2. b., which involves 
results of the real data, fluctuations after t=1251 (day) have become smaller than they were 
before. For the term 1< t < 625 (day) the same effect is also present but less visible, where 
some fluctuations have occured with big amplitudes at a few number of days. 
 
 
Summary and conclusion 
 
With  a  linear  potential  energy  for  the  current  epoch  of  DJIA,  energy  conservation  theory 
yields in equations of motion for the index in terms of long-term moving averages, which may 
be  utilized  by  some  random  decoration  processes  for  future.  Then  the  resulting  decorated 
index value may be used for short-term (day to day) fluctuations and for their averages. As 
predicted  within  the  present  formalism,  the  index  will  fall  to  8,000’s  and  below  within  the 
coming  500  days,  as  a  result  the  fluctions  will  increase  accordingly,  as  shown  on  the  right 
hand side bottom corner of Fig 2. a.

Figure 1.  
DJIA, about the Apr-Sep2000 climax is described by a rise and a fall of 
the price in a gravity g = –0.01212 (lcu/day2). The initial (shooting) speed at the beginning of 
1995 is v01= 10.17 (lcu/day). The price falls down after the maximum height and inelastically 
bounces  back  with  v02=  8.43  (lcu/day)  in  the  same  gravity,  and  rises  up  to  11,000’s  in 
accordance with the expression χ – χ0 = (v0)2/2g, which is obtained by taking time derivative of 
Eq.  (1)  and  equating  it  to  zero  and  performing  a  few  algebraic  opererations  afterwards.  A 
recession, back to 8,000’s and below is expected within the coming 500 days.

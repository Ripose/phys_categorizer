ABSTRACT 

We develop the theory of a generalized probability tomography method to image source poles and dipoles of a 
geophysical vector or scalar field dataset. The purpose of the new generalized method is to improve the resolution 
power  of  buried  geophysical  targets,  using  probability  as  a  suitable  paradigm  allowing  all  possible  equivalent 
solution to be included into a unique 3D tomography image. The new method is described by first assuming that 
any geophysical field dataset can be hypothesized to be caused by a discrete number of source poles and dipoles. 
Then,  the  theoretical  derivation  of  the  source  pole  occurrence  probability  (SPOP)  tomography,  previously 
published in detail for single geophysical methods, is symbolically restated in the most general way. Finally, the 
theoretical derivation of the source dipole occurrence probability (SDOP) tomography is given following a formal 
development similar to that of the SPOP tomography. The discussion of a few examples allows us to demonstrate 
that  the  combined  application  of  the  SPOP  and  SDOP  tomographies  can  provide  the  best  core-and-boundary 
resolution of the most probable buried sources of the anomalies detected within a datum domain. 
 

 
 
 
 

INTRODUCTION 

 
Probability  tomography  has  recently  been  proposed  in 
applied geophysics as a method to virtually explore the 
subsoil in the search of the most probable emplacement 
of the sources of anomalies appearing in a field dataset 
collected on the ground surface. It has originally been 
formulated for the self-potential method (Patella, 1997 
a, b). Afterward, it has been extended to the geoelectric 
(Mauriello et al., 1998; Mauriello and Patella, 1999 a, 
2005  b),  em  induction  (Mauriello  and  Patella,  1999  b, 
2000),  gravity  (Mauriello  and  Patella,  2001  a,  b)  and 
magnetic methods (Mauriello and Patella, 2005 a). 

In this paper we generalize the theory of probability 
tomography to any geophysical anomalous field, under 
the  assumption  that  the  dataset,  collected  in  a  generic 
datum domain (volume, surface or line), can be viewed 
as  the response  of  a double set  of  hidden  sources,  say 
poles and dipoles, requiring to be identified. 

The poles have been the only sources postulated in 
the original treatment. They have been assumed as the 
most elementary sources of physical nature, capable of 
reproducing, with appropriate spatial combinations, the 
responses  due  to  macroscopic  entities.  No  recourse  to 
an a priori choice of a class of models, able to generate 
synthetic responses compatible with the field ones as in 

any standard deterministic interpretation approach, has 
been included in the probability tomography approach, 
thus avoiding any subjectivity during the interpretation 
process.  The  polar  source  probability  tomography  has 
shown its full capacity to single out the most probable 
location of the core of the source bodies. 

In the forthcoming formulation, dipolar sources are 
also postulated and are assumed as the most elementary 
physical  sources  that  may  explain,  with  proper  spatial 
combinations,  the  response  due  to  sharp  macroscopic 
discontinuities. Dipolar source probability tomography 
is  expected  to  give  insight  into  the  spatial  extent  of  a 
source body by evidencing the most probable location 
of its boundaries. The joint analysis of pole and dipole 
tomographies appears to be a goal of great importance 
for a better definition of the sources of anomalies. 

 
 
THE PROBABILITY TOMOGRAPHY 
GENERALIZED APPROACH 

 
Consider a reference coordinate system with the (x,y)-
plane placed at sea level and the z-axis positive down-
wards, and a 3D datum domain V as drawn in figure 1. 
In particular, the top surface S can represent a non-flat 
ground  survey  area  defined  by  a  topographic  function

zt(x,y) and the bottom surface zb(x,y) can correspond to 
the maximum depths at which datum points are placed. 
Let  A(r)  be  a  vector  anomaly  field  at  a  set  of  datum 
points r≡(x,y,z), with r∈V. 

 
 

 

The  3D  datum  domain,  characterized  by 
Figure 1 
irregular  boundary  surfaces.  The  (x,y)-plane  is  placed 
at sea level and the z-axis points into the earth.

the operator dn⋅∇n, where dn is the dipole moment. 

The effect of both the M and N source elements at a 
datum point r∈V is analytically described by the same 
vector kernel s(r).

In some geophysical applications, the anomaly field

The concept of probability ascribed to the function

subset E of a space of states U a real number Ψ(E) such 
that (Gnedenko 1979) 
 
Ψ(E)≥0, for every E, 
if E ∩ F≡0, with E,F⊂U, Ψ(E∪F)=Ψ(E)+Ψ(F), 
Ψ(U)=1.

can be defined as a probability density, since it allows a 
measure of the probability to find pm at rm to be got in 
agreement with axioms 8a, 8b and 8c. 

Practically, ηm

(P)  is  different  from  Ψm  only  for  an 
unknown constant factor and has also the advantage to 
give the sign of the source. Thus we can conventionally 
(P) as the probability measure of source pole 
assume ηm
occurrence at rm. 

The ηm

(P) function, specified in eq.5, can readily be 
calculated knowing the mathematical expression of the 
function s(r,rm), which is given the role of source pole 
elementary  scanner  (SPES)  in  the  SPOP  tomographic 
procedure we are going to explain. 

The SPOP 3D tomography of a geophysical dataset 
consists in a scanning procedure operated by the SPES 
function.  In  practice,  as  the  distribution  of  the  source 
poles responsible of an anomaly field A(r) is unknown, 
we place a virtual source pole of unitary strength at the 
nodes of a grid filling a supposed target space beneath 
the ground surface. Since the elementary kernel s(r) is 
a  known  function,  although  assuming  different  forms 
according to the geophysical method that is considered, 
we  can  compute  the  SPOP  value  at  each  node  of  the 
grid,  using  a  digitized  form  of  the  integral  in  eq.5. A 
positive SPOP value gives the probability with which a 
positive  pole,  located  where  the  SPOP  value  has  been 
computed,  can  be  considered  responsible  of  the  A(r) 
field. Conversely, a negative value gives the occurrence 
probability of a negative source pole. 

We show now a very simple example in order to let 
the  main  qualitative  aspects  of  the  SPOP  tomography 
be soon clarified. Figure 2 shows two uniform spheres 
immersed in a homogeneous half-space at a depth and 
horizontal distance as displayed in the top section. The 
contrasts  between  the  constitutive  physical  parameter 
of the two spheres and that of the hosting medium are 
of  opposite  sign. The  anomaly  field  is  supposed  to  be 
depicted  by  a  scalar  quantity,  e.g.  the  z-component  of 
the gravitational field, and the corresponding dataset to 
consist of measures taken on the ground. The anomaly 
field map is shown, qualitatively, in the mid horizontal 
slice in figure 2. 

As the 3D V-domain, previously introduced, in this 
case collapses to a 2D S-domain, the volume integrals 
appearing  in  the  previous  equations  reduce  to  surface 
integrals extended over S, which in general is a non-flat 
(P) function 
portion of the ground surface. The SPOP ηm
is now written as

For the example of figure 2, S has been taken a flat 
horizontal surface, hence from eq.12 it follows g(z)=1. 
The  SPOP  tomography  algorithm  is  applied  with 
the aim of designing a probability space of occurrence 
of elementary source poles, responsible of the detected 
anomalies on the ground surface. Therefore, in order to 
enhance the filtering property of the scanner procedure, 

http://arxiv.org/physics/0602056

Therefore, at each point rn three values of ηnν

(D) can 
be  calculated. They  give  a  measure  of  the  probability, 
with  which  the  three  components  of  the  source  dipole 
located at rn can be considered responsible of the A(r) 
(D)|  should  reveal 
field.  We  expect  that  maxima  of  |ηnν
structural discontinuity surfaces. 

Also the SDOP function can be calculated knowing 
the  mathematical  expression  of  the  derivatives  of  the 
base  function  s(r,rn).  Each  derivative  is  now  assigned 
the  role  of  source  dipole  elementary  scanner  (SDES) 
function. 

The SDOP 3D tomography of a geophysical dataset 
consists again in a scanner procedure operated this time 
by the SDES function. In practice, as we do not know 
the  distribution  of  the  dipoles  contributing to  generate 
the anomaly field A(r), we adopt now a virtual source 
dipole of unitary strength and put it at the same nodes 
of  the  grid,  as  previously. We  can  compute  the  SDOP 
value at each node by a digitized form of the integral in 
eq.16. A non-vanishing value of any of the three SDOP 
functions gives the probability with which the relative 
component of a source dipole moment, localized at the 
point  where  the  SDOP  value  has  been  computed,  can 
be considered responsible of the given A(r) field. The 
algebraic sign indicates now the direction of the dipole 
component along the axis to which the SDOP function 
under examination refers. 

We show now another synthetic example in order to 
illustrate the joint peculiarities of the SPOP and SDOP 
imaging. Figure 3a shows two infinitely extended half-
plates in contact, characterized by opposite contrasts of 
their constitutive parameter with respect to the hosting 
half-space.  The  graph  of  a  scalar  function,  simulating 
e.g. the Bouguer gravity anomaly along a profile L, is 
reported. Since the 3D V-domain collapses to a 1D L-
domain, the volume integrals in all previous SPOP and 
SDOP equations reduce to line integrals extended over 
L, which, in general, can be a non-straight line. 

Assuming  that  the  L-domain  lies  completely  on  a 
plane normal to the (x,y)-plane as the red line in figure 
1, and its projection onto this plane, parallel to x-axis, 
is a straight segment of length 2X, using a topographic 
line regularization factor h(x) expressed by 
 

P.Mauriello and D.Patella 

in making the integrations in eq.13 and eq.14 it can be 
advisable to select different integration surfaces, letting 
X  and  Y  vary  from  sufficiently  small  values  up  to  the 
size of the survey area. The smallest values for X and Y 
can  be  chosen  such  that  the  anomaly  generated  by  a 
source element located at a node of the grid is entirely 
contained in the surface domain [-X,X]×[-Y,Y] centered 
over  the  source  pole. At  each  node,  the  computations 
must  be  carried  out  for  all  sizes  of  the  (X,Y)-domain. 
The  highest  calculated  value  will  be  assumed  with  its 
sign as the most correct SPOP value for that point. 

The  result  of  the  SPOP  tomography  applied  to  the 
two-sphere example is depicted in the lower section of 
figure 2. A diffuse picture of the most probable source 
poles location is the peculiar feature of this new type of 
target  detection  approach.  The  vertical  and  horizontal 
positions  of  the  barycentres  of  the  spheres  is  exactly 
reconstructed,  since  they  correspond  with  the  points 
where the highest absolute values of the SPOP function 
have been got. As expected, no evidence can, however, 
be deducted as it concerns the size of the spheres.

double  sum  in  eq.3,  apply  again  Schwarz’s  inequality

Geophysical tomography. Theory and examples 

Figure 3b shows the result of the SPOP tomography 
along  a  vertical  section  through  the  profile,  normal  to 
the strike direction of the 2D target. Two pairs of SPOP 
nucleuses with opposite sign can be recognized at two 
different depth levels. The top pair is located inside the 
half-plates, while the bottom pair is placed well beyond 
the half-plates with a larger separation than that of the 
top pair. In each pair the sign of each nucleus conforms 
to the sign of the constitutive parameter contrast of the 
corresponding  half-plate.  The  highest  SPOP  values  in 
modulus belong to the deeper pair, which thus provides 
an  equivalent  distributions  of  source  poles  compatible 
with the given anomaly profile. The top pair, to which 
smaller  SPOP  values  correspond  in  modulus,  appears 
to correctly outline the top level of the two half-plates. 
The top pair of poles thus appears to be a geometrically 
correct  equivalent  representation  of  the  semi-infinite 
plates. The comparison between the two pairs of source 
poles shows that the top poles marking the existence of 
the  true  2D  model  have  less  probability  to  occur  than 
the  deeper  equivalent  source  poles,  which  actually  do 
not correspond to any structure in the starting model. 

The  SDOP  tomography  can  now  be  used  to  try  to 
solve this clear case of equivalence. As previously said, 
due to the 1D nature of the dataset, from eq.23 only the 
horizontal  x-derivative  has  been  calculated.  The  result 
of  the  SDOP  tomography  is  illustrated  in  figure  3c, 
wherein only a nucleus very neatly appears astride the 
top portion of the lateral discontinuity between the two 
half-plates. It extends down to the bottom wedge of the 
contact with still appreciable SDOP values. Its positive 
sign indicates the direction of the horizontal component 
of the dipole moment, which in full agreement with the 
assumed model lies along the positive direction of the 
x-axis from left to right. This is a very important result, 
which confirms our basic assumption of the joint SPOP 
and SDOP tomography as an efficient approach to the 
analysis of the most probable equivalent solutions of a 
given inversion problem. 
 
 

CONCLUSION 

 
Adhering  to  the  propensity  interpretative  approach  of 
modern  science  (Marshall  and  Zohar,  1997)  a  proba-
bility tomography method has been developed in order 
to  analyze  geophysical  vector  or  scalar  field  datasets. 
The  purpose  of  the  new  method  is  to  get  rid  of  some 
restrictive  approaches  that  are  conventionally  adopted 
to  interpret  geophysical  datasets,  usually  derived  from 
very  simplistic  assumptions  about  the  physical  reality, 
often dictated by some more or less idealized or exotic 
geological concepts. We postulate that the geophysical 
reality  consists  of  two  kinds  of  reality,  say  actual  and 
potential, where we mean for actual what we get when 
we can directly explore the geophysical entity, and for

potential the largest spread of possible structural confi-
gurations compatible with the measured datasets. 

The new method has been tested on a few synthetic 
examples,  which  demonstrate  that  the  whole  spectrum 
of the potential solutions to a geophysical interpretation 
problem can coexist, from a probabilistic point of view, 
with  the  actual  model,  i.e.  with  the  model  which  can 
then be proved to closely represent the true situation. 

As previously said, we have gone through the SPOP 
tomography again in order to introduce in a direct and 
more fluent way the innovative argument of the source 
dipole tomography. For details about the application of 
the  SPOP  tomography  method  to  specific  geophysical 
methods, the interested reader is referred to the papers

#  Abstract: 
 
This  contribution  shows  that  the  main  topics  of  Relativity  can  be  discussed  at  an 
elementary  level  and  in  a  considerable  extent  –  including  the  formal  results  of  "Time 
Dilation"  and  "Lorentz  Contraction"  –  by  a  minor  modification  of  the  usual 
mathematical  formalism  employed  to  describe  uniform  and  accelerated  motion.  The 
proposed strategy begins with a "free–fall" experiment, followed by a discussion of the 
results  in  order  to  include  deviations  of  the  experimental  data  with  respect  to  the 
conventional kinematics model. 
 
 
# 1 – Introduction 
 

Introducing the basic principles of Mechanics, as early as possible, is a desire of 
physical educators, even at the sacrifice of a rigorous mathematical treatment, provided 
the  concepts  can  be  preserved.  Nowadays,  first–year  university  students  of    physical 
sciences have such a spectrum of information concerning Gravitation, Quantum theory, 
Relativity and applications, particularly in the domain of Astrophysics, that the 'desire' 
transforms into a real necessity.  

This fact rests, probably, not only on information; we have to recognise that the 
evolution  of  physics  led  to,  say,  four  mechanics:  Classical,  Quantum,  Relativistic  and 
Statistical  mechanics.  In  effect,  the  structure  of  formal  and  non–formal  education  is 
such  that  secondary  school  students  have  knowledge  of  the  first  and  at  least  good 
information concerning Quantum and Relativistic theories. 

On  this  basis,  therefore,  it  is  difficult  to  explain  just  the  Laws  of    Newton  to 
students incoming to the university; frequently asked questions range from the general 
validity of the laws to details such as the Uncertainty Principle, "twin paradox", and the 
behaviour of a variety of objects, such as photons, electrons, satellites, etc. .   

We are thus lead to the task of teaching Classical Mechanics, while preserving 
the  curiosity  of  the  students  on  those  up-to-date  topics;  during  the  last  semesters  we 
started an attempt to extract the main concepts from Einstein's formulation and present 
them in an introductory undergraduate physics course directed to Electrical Engineering 
students.  In our view, the experimental way has proved to be quite precise, and that is 
the procedure here described. 
 
# 2 – Experimental procedure and analysis  
 

Relativity and also Quantum Mechanics [1] are usually introduced via  historical 
aspects  paralleling  a  critical  review  of  some  crucial  experiments;  however,  this 
approach  is  out  of  the  scope  in  introductory  courses  [2],  once  the  students  have  no 
background other than secondary school physics.

Then  a  laboratory  experiment  was  carried  out,  employing  passage  photocell 

The procedure employed here starts with the experimental determination of  'g' – 
the  acceleration  of  gravity:  about  20  students,  divided  in  groups  of    4,  are  asked  to 
measure the height  and time of fall of  three blocks of  distinct masses and determine 
'g', by plotting the corresponding height against the medium value of  the elapsed time, 
H (t). A technical report  of this experiment should be presented after week. 
The relatively low frequency of good results ( g-values may typically range from 5 m/s2 
to  15  m/s2  !  )  causes  embarrassment:  most  students  reject  the  experimental  data  and 
some even refuse to present a report . 
 
detectors connected to a chronometer (Fig. 1).

Here  the  first  detector  turns  the    chronometer  ON,    while  the  second  turns  it 
OFF; by varying the distance – 'H'  between detectors and registering the time of fall, a 
plot of H(t) leads to the value of the local gravity.  
Students are asked to plot H x t and also H x t2 ; Figure 2 shows a typical result.

This second procedure gives a more reliable ( about 10 m/s2 ) g–value;  however, 
comparing the experimental curves with the theoretical prediction, we note the presence 
of a  small Y-axis component .  The familiar equation of motion is:

For a body  abandoned quite near the first detector, the relation should be just

At this point a quantum – mechanical discussion of  Uncertaint could be done; 
however, we postpone this in order to centre the problem on Time. The reason is that – 
at this stage –   students are aware of the importance of a precise time measurement in 
order  to  obtain  a  good  g–value,  since  the  first  experiment  was  carried  out  "by  their 
own",  employing  conventional  clocks  and  visually  detecting  the  motion,  whereas  the 
second was a concrete laboratory test that includes automatic detection. 

Thus we consider the existence of a "Hidden Time" – t* , or a time not detected 
by  the  instrumentation,  which  is  responsible  for  the  initial  ∆Y  in  terms  of    initial 
velocity X time ( Vo x t* ) . Due to equations (3), students can easily comprehend t* also 
as a means of expressing ∆Y as a function of an initial 'imprecision' of  height ( Ho ). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                  tm 

In order to increase the experimental time with respect to the "Hidden Time" we 
are naturally directed to analyse the motion of a brick sliding down an incline. This was 
the procedure adopted by Newton [3] and also Galileo [4] to study acceleration.

Now  we  focus  attention  on  description  of  the  motion;  according  to  Figure  3, 

there are three times involved:  
 
t  x  ,  which  is  the    effective  time  of  motion,  or  the  time  present  as  a  parameter  in  the 
equation of motion (1). 
t  m ,   the measured time of motion, or the time detected by the chronometer. 
t* ,  the "Hidden Time" , which is related to the time required to start the 
      detection of motion. 
 

Students are asked to determine g from the experimental data but mainly to right 
the equations of motion in terms of  t  m  and  t x .  At this point they easily realise that 
the  plots  of    Figure  2  are,    in  fact,    H  =  H  (t  m)  ,  that  is,  an  experimental  relation; 
conversely, equation (1) is H = H (t x ), that is, a mathematical ( theoretical) model . The 
connection between the experimental and effective time is: 
 
tm = t x +  L / vs                                                                                                                 (4) 
 
vs being the signal velocity trough the wire of length L. 
 

The "Hidden Time" t*  appears explicitly as a time (delay) required to transport 

the information from the plane to the chronometer:  
 
t * ≡ ti = L / vs ,  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

     (5) 

The component  of acceleration along the incline is a = g sen θ ; thus if the brick 

However, the experimental arrangement tells that when the chronometer starts to

run, the brick should have a component of velocity given by:  
 
vo = g sen θ  L / vs                               
 
 
Note  that  this  is  a  Classical  or  a  Causality  concept,  that  is:    if  one  event  (  the 
motion of the brick ) is the cause of a second ( the motion of the chronometer ), then the 
second  event  must  surely  succeed  the  first,  in  any  coordinate  system.  Indeed,  we  can 
write the kinetic equations in the chronometer ( t m ) coordinate system:

                   (8) 

 
But  the  time  t  x    in  equation  (8)  corresponds  to  a  clock  simultaneous  with  the 
 
brick; in relativistic terms, this clock registers the proper time of the brick.  At this point 
students  realise that t  x is obtained just by means of t  m ; moreover, they arrive to the

theoretical  aspect  of  t  x  .Thus  we  believe  that  this  is  the  precise  moment  to  discuss 
Simultaneity in terms of flux of information; taking relation (4), we have:

Now  relation  (10)  is  analogous  to  the  relativistic  expression  for  the  Time

Dilation effect:

This  way,  the  concept  of    Proper  Time  is  introduced  as  a  necessary  way  to 
express  the  results  of  experimental  data;  moreover,  students  can  understand    Time 
Dilation  as  a  natural  effect  that  appears  in  Relativity  theory  and  not  in  newtonian 
mechanics, since the factor α tends to zero in the classical limit ( ti  << tm ) . 
 
The interesting feature of this formula is that it is independent of the notion of 
moving frames; in other words, we  arrived at  (11) in order to avoid the usual Relativity 
discussion of frames in an introductory  course, when the students are just learning how 
scale, plot and analyse fixed frames. 
 
In  our  view,  this  approach  puts  Relativity  into  a  sounded  basis,  especially  for 
Electrical  Engineering  students;  discussion  of    triggering,  response  time  and  circuitry 
impedance come naturally as a consequence of  the Time Dilation effect .  
Another  qualitative  aspect  is  that  students  can  work  out  (11)  comparing  it  with  the 
equations  shown  in  standard  textbooks  [5,6];  suppose,  for  instance,  that    'L'  is  made 
parallel to the direction X in Fig 3; then the fraction L / t m represents the velocity of the 
brick, say, v m . Further, suppose a low index optical fibber transporting the signal, that 
is,  vs ~ c . Then, equation (11) becomes:

             (11.a) 

revealing an extremely formal equivalence with the familiar relativistic expression. 
 
 
A  discussion  of  Lorentz  contraction  is  also  possible  if  the  teacher  takes  the 
necessary care on dealing with the concepts of space and length; from equations  (7) and 
(8) we have: 
 

                                                              (12)

where we used the binomial theorem retaining only the first order term. 
 
 
We  then  have  a  peculiar  result;  this  formulae  is  reasonable  to  describe  the 
Lorentz  contraction,  or  the  contraction  in  the  length  of  a  rigid  body  moving  in  a 
direction parallel to that length, though this is not  Length Contraction.  
 
But this would be consistent with our approach here if historical  [7] aspects are 
inserted on the discussion; the reason is that Lorentz effectively used his formulation in 
order to explain the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment. Nevertheless, the 
functional  behaviour  of    equation  (16)  is  worth-paying.  Consider  Figure  4  which  is 
presented to the students after the above discussion:

The argument here can be  as follows: suppose that at time t = t x the position of 
 
the  brick  is  that  shown  in  Fig.  4  (a);  then  we  take  a  photography,  which  is  a  kind  of 
measurement.  But  according  to  equation  (9)  ,  that  is,  according  to  the  Time  Dilation 
effect, we will see the brick  at the position shown in Fig. 4 (b). In other words, this is

We believe on the possibility of extension of this procedure to secondary school. 

what equation (16) tells, that is, the position of the brick which would be recorded by a 
clock  located  on  and  moving  along  with  it  is  contracted  when  measured  by  a 
chronometer moving with any finite velocity with respect to the body.  
 
Again,  this  scheme  of  presentation  avoids  moving  frames;  however,  most 
students are able to master the passage from the real experiment to the idealised one  of 
a    chronometer  moving  with  respect  to  the  brick.,  which  is  equivalent  to  the  methods 
they will see later in sequential courses of Mechanics. 
 
 
# 3 – Conclusions 
 
The strategy above shows that the main topics of Relativity theory can be treated 
 
in  elementary  undergraduate  courses  with  considerable  success;  according  to  our 
experience,  this  is  directly  related  to  the  experimental  approach  plus  the  element  of 
surprise involved on the determination of the local gravity as opposed to the subsequent  
description of the motion.   
 
Generally  speaking,  there  is  a  substantial  change  of  attitude  of  the  students 
during  the  process,  once  they  start  considering  relativity  as  necessary  evolution  of 
newtonian mechanics, substituting their initial curiosity about unusual phenomena by a 
sounded physical consideration of the consequences of rapid events.

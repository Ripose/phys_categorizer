Optimization of Coupling between Photonic 
Crystal Resonator and Curved Microfiber

In-Kag Hwang, Guk-Hyun Kim, and Yong-Hee Lee

Abstract— The  evanescent  coupling  from  a  photonic  crystal 
resonator to a micron-thick optical fiber is investigated in detail by 
using  a  3D-FDTD  method.  Properly  designed  photonic  crystal 
cavity  and  taper  structures  are  proposed,  and  optimal  operating 
conditions  are  found  to  enhance  the  coupling  strength  while 
suppressing other cavity losses including the coupling to the slab 
propagating  mode  and  to  the  higher-order  fiber  mode.  In 
simulation,  the  coupling  into  the  fundamental  fiber  mode  is 
discriminated  from  other  cavity  losses  by  spatial  and  parity 
filtering of the FDTD results. The coupling efficiency of more than 
80%  into  the  fundamental  fiber  mode  together  with  a  total  Q 
factor of 5,200 is achieved for the fiber diameter of 1.0 µm and the 
air gap of 200 nm between the fiber and the cavity.

INTRODUCTION

R

ecent  progresses  of  photonic  crystal  technology  made  it 
possible to realize ultrasmall, ultrahigh-Q optical cavities 
which are of interest in quantum optics [1,2], nonlinear optics
[3,4],  lasers [5],  and  optical  communications [6].  The  optical 
interface  of  those  cavities  with  external  optics  is  now  an 
important  issue  for  their  practical  applications.  The  most 
common way is to use cavity-to-waveguide coupling followed 
by  waveguide-optical  fiber  coupling.  However,  due  to  the 
considerable  coupling  loss  coming  from  the  large  index 
difference and the mode size mismatch at the waveguide-fiber 
junction, very delicate coupling element is required to reduce 
the loss below a tolerable level.  The direct evanescent coupling 
between  the  cavity  and  a  tapered  optical  fiber  has  been  also 
proposed  and  demonstrated [7].  The  direct  optical  fiber 
coupling may be better fitted to many applications especially for 
a  single  isolated  device  because  of  its  negligible  propagation 
loss, direct interconnection with external optical  systems,  and 
tunability  of  the  coupling  strength.  The  significant  drawback, 
however,  is  found  in  its  poor  coupling  efficiency.  It  mainly 
comes from large difference of refractive indices of silica fiber 
(n~1.5)  and  of  semiconductor(n~3.4)-based  photonic  crystal 
cavity, which results in inefficient mode overlap and poor phase 

matching between the fiber and the cavity modes. Very recently, 
we reported that the fiber coupling strength can be significantly 
increased by proper  design  of  the  photonic  crystal  cavity [8], 
and highly efficient (estimated to ~70%) output collection from 
the cavity into the fiber was experimentally demonstrated [9].
The  coupling  scheme  is  depicted  in  Fig.  1.  A  microfiber 
prepared by tapering conventional single mode fiber down to ~1 
µm is positioned above the photonic crystal cavity with an air 
gap of typically less than 1 µm. The microfiber is sharply bent 
with  a  radius  of  ~  50  µm  to  be  able  to  selectively  access  the 
photonic crystal cavity of interest without unwanted interaction 
with other regions. The alignment of the curved feature of the 
fiber  also  eliminates  the  requirement  of  delicate  alignment  of 
the taper. 

There are several issues that require special attention when 
one  wishes  to  achieve  optimal  fiber  coupling  for  specific 
applications. In this paper, the detailed coupling mechanism of
the  cavity-fiber  system 
the 
finite-difference time domain (FDTD) simulation, and optimal 
coupling structures and operating conditions are proposed. This 
study also reveals the limiting factors hindering the achievement
of nearly 100% coupling efficiency.

II. CONDITIONS OF EFFICIENT FIBER COUPLING

Total quality factor (Qtot) of the coupled system of Fig. 1 can 
be decomposed into several components as follows, depending 
on the route that photons take to exit the cavity.

Each term is proportional to coupling strength to air (1/Qair), 
slab(1/Qslab),  and  fiber(1/Qfiber),  and  the  fiber  coupling  is 
divided again into the couplings to fundamental (LP01) and first 
higher-order (LP11) modes of the microfiber. Coupling to other 
higher-order fiber modes is negligible when the taper diameter
is  less  than  a  few  µm.  Qair  is  not  significantly  affected  by 
presence of the microfiber, and thus almost fixed at the intrinsic
Q of the cavity.  Coupling to the slab  mode(1/Qslab)  is  usually 
negligibly small because of the photonic bandgap formed along 
the  in-plane  direction,  but,  it  dramatically  increases  as  the 
the  cavity.  QLP01  and  QLP11 are 
microfiber  approaches 
determined  by  their  mode  overlaps  with  the  resonant  cavity 
mode, and dependent on various parameters such as the cavity 
structure,  the  fiber  diameter  and  the  air  gap  between  the 
microfiber and the cavity. Since the microfiber converges to a 
single mode fiber at the end of the taper, any higher-order mode 
coupled from the cavity will be eventually lost and only the light 
in the fundamental mode can contribute to the fiber output. Thus, 
the photon coupling efficiency ((cid:5)) from the cavity into the fiber 
is defined by

 To  achieve  a  high (cid:5),  the  coupling  strength  for  LP01  mode 
should be made much stronger than other couplings, or QLP01 << 
Qair, Qslab, QLP11. It can be realized by proper design of photonic 
crystal cavity and microfiber structures, and optimization of the 
coupling  conditions.  In  advance  of  simulations  of  the  fiber 
coupling in various conditions, the modal characteristics of the 
fiber  and  the  cavity  are  investigated  first  to  get  better 
understanding of the following simulation results.

The  effective  refractive  indices  of  the  LP01  and  the  LP11
microfiber modes are shown in Fig. 2 (a) as a function of fiber
diameter normalized by wavelength. There are two degenerate 
modes with orthogonal polarizations in the LP01 mode, and four 
almost-degenerate  modes  with  different  polarizations  and 
intensity distributions in the LP11 mode[10]. Since the photonic 
crystal cavity mode of interest has an even Ey field respect to the 
x-z  plane,  it  couples  with  the  fiber  modes  that  have  even  Ey
component in their evanescent field. This condition is satisfied 
in only two fiber modes, each one from LP01 and LP11 mode, and 
their electrical field profiles are shown in Fig. 2 (b). Here we 
assumed that the photonic crystal slab is located below the taper. 
The  LP11  mode  cutoff  is  D/(cid:6)=0.75,  which  corresponds  to  the 
fiber diameter of D(cid:1)1.1 µm for the wavelength of 1520 nm. The 
coupling  strength  between  the  fiber  and  the  cavity  modes  is 
determined by the transverse mode overlap in y-z plane and the 
phase matching along x-axis between the two modes. In terms of 
the  phase  matching,  a  microfiber  with  a  large  D and  thus  a 
higher  effective  index  is  preferred  since  the  cavity  mode  has

relatively  high  effective  index.  On  the  other  hand,  the  mode 
overlap is enhanced for a microfiber with a smaller D where the 
mode is weakly guided and the evanescent field extends farther 
to  the  photonic  crystal  cavity.  These  arguments  suggest  that 
there  exists  an  optimal  fiber  diameter  where  the  coupling 
strength is maximized. 

The  photonic  crystal  cavity  structure  used  in  this  study  is 
shown in Fig. 3 (a). It has been modified from a 5-lattice-long 
linear cavity[11] so that the fiber coupling strength(1/QLP01) is 
enhanced while the  radiation  into  air(1/Qair)  is  suppressed.[8] 
The slab thickness was 0.6 a, where a is a lattice constant. The 
resonant  mode  with  the  lowest  frequency  was  found  at 
a/(cid:6)=0.328  with  an  intrinsic Q  factor  of  87,000.  Here  we 
assumed  that  a=500  nm  and  the  resonance  wavelength  was
found  to  be  1524  nm.  The  Ey  field  profile  and  its  Fourier 
components are shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (b), respectively. The 
peak in the Fourier space was positioned at kx~0.5 (2(cid:7)/a) which 
corresponds to the effective refractive index  of  kx/(2(cid:7)/(cid:6))~1.5. 
The  white  dotted  circle  is  the  light  cone,  which  shows  the 
Fourier components of the cavity mode being coupled to the air 
and contributing to 1/Qair. The Fourier component of the LP01

Fourier  components  overlapped  with

participate  in  the  coupling  with  the  fiber  mode.  The  large 
intensity contrast between the two areas in the white circle and 
the  black  ellipse  indicates  that  the  cavity  was  effectively
designed  to  suppress  the  coupling  to  air  while  satisfying 
reasonable  (although,  still  not  excellent)  phase  matching 
condition with the fiber mode.  The  Fourier  component  of  the 
LP11 mode which has smaller effective index than the LP01 mode 
should be located between the white circle and the black ellipse 
in the Fourier space, and the phase matching is not as good as 
that of the LP01 mode. 

III. COMPUTATIONAL SCHEME

To understand the optical coupling from a photonic crystal 
light source to an optical fiber, the 3-dimensional FDTD method 
was used. The computational structure is shown in Fig. 4 (a), 
which included the photonic crystal slab with the cavity in its 
center and the curved fiber taper with the curvature radius of 50 
µm.  The  computation  grid  size  was  one  tenth  of  the  lattice 
constant. The two main parameters we varied in each simulation 
were the fiber diameter (D) and the air gap (dgap) between the 
cavity and the fiber. The cavity mode was excited by the dipole 
source  with  the  center  frequency  of  0.328  located  inside  the 
cavity. 

The  total  Q  of  the  system  was  obtained  by  measuring  the 
decay rate of the cavity mode, and the optical power flow was 
also monitored at slab edges, fiber facets and air boundaries, to 
calculate  each  coupling  strength  (1/Q)  in  Eq.  (2).  The  power 
flow  integrated  over  the  fiber  facet  contains  the  both  optical 
powers  in  LP01  and  LP11  modes.  To  selectively  measure  the 
power in LP01 mode, we used the  parity  relations  of  the  field 
components  of  the  LP01  and  the  LP11  modes,  which  are 
observed in Fig. 2 (b). The two modes have the opposite parities 
in their electrical and magnetic fields respect to the center plane.

vectors were integrated over the dotted rectangles and circles to calculate the 
powers  coupled  to  the  slab,  and  to  the  fiber,  respectively.  (b)  Detailed 
description  of  the  integrated  regions  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  power 
portions coupled to LP01 and LP11 modes. A’ is a symmetric plane of A respect 
to the center plane containing the fiber axis.

For example, the LP01 mode has even parity in Ey component 
while the LP11 mode has odd parity, and thus Ey component of 
LP01  mode  could  be  extracted  by  taking  only  the  symmetric
(even)  component  from  the  total  Ey  field  as  shown  in  the
following Eq. (3). Once all the fields are retrieved to construct 
the LP01 mode, the optical powers in the two modes, P01 and 
P11 can be calculated by integrating the Poynting vector over the 
fiber cross-section.

the fiber coupling efficiency reached the maximum at dgap~200 
nm.  At  the  small  air  gap  of  dgap  <  200  nm,  the  cavity  energy 
started to leak through the slab and the relative portion of the 
fiber coupling decreased. The propagating wave along the slab 
was found in a TM-like mode which originates from the TE-like 
cavity  mode.  Note  that  this  TM-like  mode  does  not  have  a 
complete bandgap and is allowed to propagate. The TE-to-TM 
mode  conversion  occurred  when  the  symmetry  of  the  cavity 
structure along z-axis is broken[12] due to the presence of the 
fiber near the cavity. 

From  the  data  of  Fig.  5  (a)  and  Qtot,  we  calculated  the
coupling strength (1/Q) for each component, and plotted in Fig. 
5 (b). Air coupling strength (Qair) only slightly changed from its 
intrinsic  value  of  87,000  over  the  variation  of  dgap.  The  slab 
coupling  strength  (1/Qslab)  was  negligible  at  a  large  gap,  but 
increased most abruptly as the gap decreased. The coupling to 
(1/QLP01)  dominated  over  other  coupling 
LP01  mode 
components in the range of dgap of 50~500 nm, and it exhibited 
exponential  decay  with  dgap  reflecting  the  fact  that  the
evanescent field of the cavity mode decays exponentially from 
the slab surface. In the fiber with the diameter of 1 µm below the 
mode cutoff, the LP11 mode is not allowed to propagate, and it 
quickly radiates into air. However, the distance from the cavity 
to the detection point was not long enough for the photons in 
LP11 to be fully radiated into air, and the non-negligible fraction 
of the LP11 photons still remained in the fiber. This contribution 
is represented by 1/QLP11 in the plot. Qtot which was originally 
87,000 decreased down to 492 at dgap=0. Qtot for dgap=200 nm is 
5,200,  which  shows  more  than  10  times  reduction  of  Q. 
However,  this  value  is  still  good  for  certain  microcavity 
applications.

 The  snap  shot  of  optical  intensity  profiles  of  the  coupled 
system at different cross-sections are depicted in Fig. 5 (c) for 
dgap=200  nm.  It  is  clearly  shown  that  the  most  of  the  output 
power  from  the  cavity  is  directed  into  the  fiber.  The 
Gaussian-like  field  profile  in  the  fiber  cross-section  indicates 
that  the  fiber  output  is  mainly  in  the  LP01  mode.  The  weak 
propagating  wave  along  the  slab  is  the  TM-like  mode  as 
discussed above. The period of intensity lobes of the fiber mode 
in x-z plane appears to be slightly larger than that of the cavity 
mode, which visually shows their imperfect phase matching as 
expected from the Fourier space analyses in Fig. 3 (b).  

Next,  we  investigated  the  coupling  characteristics  of  fibers 
with  various  diameters,  D.  In  Fig.  6  (a),  the  fiber  coupling 
efficiency,  (cid:5),  was  plotted  as  a  function  of  dgap  for  a  fiber 
diameter varying from 0.6 to 1.4 µm. In all cases, the coupling 
peak appeared at dgap=200 nm, and the peak value reached the 
maximum at D=1.0 µm. In the same way used above, 1/Q for 
LP01 and LP11 mode coupling was calculated and plotted in Fig. 
6  (b)  and  (c).  LP01  mode  coupling  strength  (1/QLP01)  always 
showed  the  exponential  decay  as  a  function  of  dgap  with  its 
absolute magnitude depending on D. The coupling strength was 
maximized at D~1.2 um where the LP01 mode is relatively well 
phase  matched  with  the  cavity  mode  while  still  have  strong 
enough evanescent field out of the fiber. The coupling strength

The cavity mode was excited by a dipole source located inside the cavity. It 
shows significant output coupling into the fundamental mode of fiber and 
relatively weak radiation into the air and the slab.

IV. RESULTS AND ANALYSES

First, for the fiber diameter fixed at 1.0 µm, we repeated the 
simulation to calculate the power flow into each section while 
varying the fiber-cavity gap (dgap), and summarized the results 
in  Fig.  5  (a).  As  the  gap  decreased,  the  more  cavity  energy 
tended to couple to the fiber instead of radiating into the air, and

diameter. Note that the total fiber coupling including LP01 and 
LP11  mode  coupling  increases  continuously  with  the  fiber 
diameter,  and  if  one  does  not  filter  out  the  LP11  mode 
contribution from the total fiber output, it may lead to a wrong 
conclusion. One example for the case of a large fiber diameter 
(D=1.4 µm) is depicted in Fig. 6 (d). It shows a distorted mode 
pattern in the fiber due to the modal interference between the 
LP01 and the LP11 modes. The coupling efficiency for the LP01 
mode  was  limited  to  66%  although  the  total  fiber  coupling 
efficiency was as large as 88%.

In the previous papers[8,9], the coupling efficiency has been 
reported without considering the contribution of the LP11 mode 
coupling. In this work, the use of the optimized photonic crystal 
cavity  and  fiber  diameter  resulted  in  the  higher  single  mode 
coupling efficiency together with the higher total Q boosted by 
factor  of  3.  There  are  several  ways  to  further  improve  the 
coupling  efficiency.  One  of  them  is  to  decrease  the  effective 
index of the cavity mode for better phase matching with the fiber 
mode. It can be done by using larger air holes for r3 in Fig. 3 (a) 
or a thinner slab. The possible drawback is that the intrinsic Q of 
the  cavity  mode  might  be  affected  as  the  mode  frequency 
approaches  the  upper  bandedge.  Another  way  is  to  use  a 
LP01-LP11 mode coupler at each end of the fiber taper to couple 
the LP11 mode into LP01 mode so that all the powers in the LP01
and LP11 modes can contribute to the single mode output.[13] In 
ideal case, the coupling efficiency may increase up to ~ 91% for 
D=1.8  um.  Or,  one  can  increase  the  fiber  coupling  strength 
simply by using a longer photonic crystal cavity.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The  evanescent  coupling  between  a modified  photonic 
crystal cavity and a curved microfiber has been studied in detail. 
Two  main  parameters  of  the  fiber  diameter  and  the  air  gap 
between the cavity and the microfiber have been investigated to 
maximize the cavity-to-fiber coupling efficiency. The use of a 
microfiber  with  a  larger  diameter  resulted  in  a  better  phase 
matching between the cavity and the fiber modes and enhanced 
the coupling strength. However, for a fiber diameter larger than 
the higher-order mode cutoff (D > 0.75 (cid:6)), the coupling to the 
higher-order fiber mode became nonnegligible, which reduced 
the  relative  coupling  into  the  fundamental  mode,  and  the 
optimal fiber diameter has been found to be 1.0 µm. To increase 
the mode overlap and the coupling efficiency, the air gap was 
decreased  until  the  cavity  mode  started  to  couple  with  a  slab 
propagating  mode.  The  coupling  efficiency  reached  the 
maximum  of  84%  for  the  air  gap  of  200  nm,  and  the  total  Q 
factor of the coupled system was 5,200.

The fiber coupling  can  also  be  used  to  inject  the  light  into 
photonic crystal cavity through the fiber as well as to collect the 
output,  which  is  very  useful  in  case  of  resonant  filters  or 
nonlinear  switches.  In  those  cases,  most  of  the  analyses  and 
discussions  on  this  study  are  still  valid,  and  the  simulation 
results presented here can be directly used to build the coupled 
mode equations describing the device responses[14].

(1/QLP11) for the LP11 mode increased monotonically with  the 
fiber diameter, which indicates that the LP11 mode coupling is 
limited mainly by the poor phase mismatching rather than the 
amplitude of the evanescent field. Its exponential dependence 
on  dgap  was  clear  when  the  LP11  mode  became  truly  guided 
mode above the LP11 mode cutoff (D>1.1 µm). Other couplings 
into  air  and  slab  did  not  change  significantly  with  the  fiber

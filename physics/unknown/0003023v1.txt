The periodic table of elementary particles

All leptons, quarks, and gauge bosons can be placed in the periodic table of

elementary particles.  The periodic table is derived from dualities of string theory
and a Kaluza-Klein substructure for the six extra spatial dimensions.  As a
molecule is the composite of atoms with chemical bonds, a hadron is the
composite of elementary particles with hadronic bonds.  The masses of
elementary particles and hadrons can be calculated using the periodic table with
only four known constants: the number of the extra spatial dimensions in the
superstring, the mass of electron, the mass of Z°, and αe.   The calculated masses
are in good agreement with the observed values.  For examples, the calculated
masses for the top quark, neutron, and pion are 176.5 GeV, 939.54MeV, and
135.01MeV in excellent agreement with the observed masses, 176 ± 13 GeV,
939.57 MeV, and 134.98 MeV, respectively. The masses of 110 hadrons are
calculated. The overall average difference between the calculated masses and the
observed masses for all hadrons is 0.29 MeV.  The periodic table of elementary
particles provides the most comprehensive explanation and calculation for the
masses of elementary particles and hadrons.

Introduction
The  mass  hierarchy  of  elementary  particles  is  one  of  the  most  difficult

problems in particle physics.  There are various approaches to solve the problem.

In this paper, the approach is to use a periodic table.  The properties of atoms can

be expressed by the periodic relationships in the periodic table of the elements.

The periodic table of the elements is based on the atomic orbital  structure.    Do

elementary particles possess orbital structure?  In this paper, the orbital structure

for elementary particles is constructed from the superstring.  The extra dimensions

in  the  superstring  become  the  orbits  with  the  Kaluza-Klein  substructure.    In  the

Kaluza’s model of five-dimensional spacetime, the fifth dimension is considered to

be  a  one-dimensional  circle  associated  with  every  point  in  ordinary  flat  four-

dimensional  spacetime.    Similarly,  in  the  Kaluza-Klein  substructure  for  the  extra

spatial dimensions, the fifth dimension is a one-dimensional circle associated with

every point in ordinary flat four-dimensional spacetime, the sixth dimension circles

the  circle  of  the  fifth  dimension,  and  in  the  same  way,  every  higher  dimension

circles the circle of the lower dimension.  The energy is assumed to be distributed

differently  in  different  dimensions  in  such  way  that  the  energy  increases  with

increased  number  of  spacetime  dimensions.  This  Kaluza-Klein  substructure  is

derived  from  the  duality  relations  for  the  superstring.    These  duality  relations

provide the explanation for the co-existence of leptons and quarks, the structure of

the dimensional orbits, and the compositions of elementary particles.

All  elementary  particles  are  placed  in  the  periodic  table  of  elementary

particles  [1].    As  a  molecule  is  the  composite  of  atoms  with  chemical  bonds,  a

hadron is the composite of elementary particles with hadronic bonds.  The masses

of  elementary  particles  and  hadrons  can  be  calculated  using  only  four  known

constants: the number of the extra spatial dimensions in the superstring, the mass

of electron, the mass of Z°, and αe.  The calculated masses of elementary particles

and hadrons are in good agreement with the observed values.  For examples, the

calculated  masses  for  the  top  quark,  neutron,  and  pion  are  176.5  GeV,

939.54MeV,  and  135.01MeV  in  excellent  agreement  with  the  observed  masses,

176 ± 13 GeV [2], 939.57 MeV, and 134.98 MeV, respectively.

Dualities

A membrane can be described as two dimensional object that moves in an

eleven dimensional space-time [3].  This membrane can be converted into the ten

dimensional superstring with the extra dimension curled into a circle to become a

closed superstring.  If the membrane is split into two membranes which are then

converted into two superstrings connected by the extra dimensions.  The

membrane becomes a dual superstring.  It is proposed that the dual superstring is

the lepton-quark dual superstring consisting lepton superstring and quark

superstring as shown in Fig. 1.

          There is S-duality between the split membrane and the dual superstring. The

membrane interacts strongly at the high energy, when the dual lepton-quark

superstring interacts weakly. The four dimensional version of S-duality is

Montonen-Olive duality [4] where the magnetic dipole is split into magnetic

monopoles, and electrons and quarks arise as solitons.

M. Duff and J. Lu [5] suggested the U-duality between the four dimensional

space-time solitonic string in six dimensional space-time and the fundamental ten

dimensional superstring.  In the same way, the dual lepton-quark superstring can

also  have two four dimensional space-time solitonic strings in two seven

dimensional space-time.  There is U-duality between the dual solitonic string and

the dual lepton-quark superstring as shown in Fig. 2.

The Type II dual string can be compacified into dual D-branes in the dual

7D tori for the dual seven extra dimensions to form orbitfolds [6].  It is proposed

that the energy associated with each extra dimension increases incrementally from

the fifth to the eleventh dimension as shown in Fig. 3.

This process generates the Kaluza-Klein substructure for the dual tori.   In

the Kaluza-Klein substructure for the seven extra spatial dimensions, the fifth

dimensional orbit is a one-dimensional circle associated with every point in

ordinary flat four-dimensional space-time,  the sixth dimensional orbit circles the

fifth dimensional orbit, and in the same way, every higher extra dimensional orbit

with higher energy circles the lower dimensional orbit with lower energy.

Each  extra  space-time  dimension  can  be  described  by  a  fermion  and  a

boson.    The  masses  of  fermion  and  its  boson  partner  are  not  the  same.    This

supersymmetry  breaking  is  in  the  form  of  a  energy  hierarchy  with  increasing

energies from the dimension five to the dimension eleven as

 

 F5 B5 F6 B6 F7 B7 F8 B8 F9 B9 F10 B10 F11 B11

where  B  and  F  are  boson  and  fermion  in  each  spacetime  dimension.  The

probability  to  transforming  a  fermion  into  its  boson  partner  in  the  adjacent

dimension is same as the fine structure constant, α, the probability of a fermion

emitting  or  absorbing  a  boson.    The  probability  to  transforming  a  boson  into  its

6

fermion partner in the same dimension is also the fine structure constant, α.  This

hierarchy can be expressed in term of the dimension number, D,

E D-1, B  =   E D,F  αD,F    ,

E D, F     =   E D, B  αD, B    ,

(1)

(2)

where ED,B and ED,F  are the energies for a boson and a fermion, respectively, and

αD, B or αD,F is the fine structure constant, which is the ratio between the energies

of a boson and its fermionic partner.  All fermions and bosons are related by the

order 1/α.  (In some mechanism for the dynamical supersymmetry breaking, the

effects of order exp(-4π2/ g2 ) where g is some small coupling, give rise to large

mass hierarchies [7].)  Assuming αD,B = αD,F , the relation between the bosons in

the  adjacent  dimensions,  then,  can  be  expressed  in  term  of  the  dimension

number, D,

where Me is the rest energy of electron, and α = αe , the fine structure constant for

the  magnetic  field.    The  bosons  generated  are    called  "dimensional  bosons"  or

"BD".  Using only αe, the mass of electron, the mass of Z 

0, and the number of extra

dimensions (seven), the masses of BD as the gauge boson can be calculated as

shown in Table 1.

In Table 1, αw is not same as α of the rest, because there is symmetry

group mixing between B5 and B7 as the symmetry mixing in the standard theory of

the electroweak interaction, and sinθw is not equal to 1.  As shown latter, B5, B6, B7,

B8, B9, and B10 are A (massless photon), π1/2, ZL

0, XR, XL, and ZR

0, respectively,

responsible for the electromagnetic field, the strong interaction, the weak (left

8

handed) interaction, the CP (right handed) nonconservation, the CP (left handed)

nonconservation, and the P (right handed) nonconservation, respectively.  The

calculated value for θw is 29.690 in good agreement with 28.70 for the observed

value of θw [8].  The total energy of the eleven dimensional superstring is the sum

of all energies of both fermions and bosons.  The calculated total energy is

1.1x1019 GeV in good agreement with the Planck mass, 1.2x1019 GeV, as the total

energy of the superstring.  As shown later, the calculated masses of all gauge

bosons are also in good agreement with the observed values.  Most importantly,

the calculation shows that exactly seven extra dimensions are needed for all

fundamental interactions.

 In the Kaluza-Klein substructure, the bosons and the fermions in the

dimensions > 5 gain masses in the four dimensional spacetime by combining with

scalar Higgs bosons in the four dimensional spacetime.  Without combining with

scalar Higgs bosons, neutrino and photon remain massless.  Graviton, the

massless boson from the vibration of the superstring, remains massless. 

3.  

The Internal Symmetries And The Interactions

All six non-gravitational dimensional bosons are represented by the internal

symmetry  groups,  consisting  of  two  sets  of  symmetry  groups,  U(1),  U(1),  and

SU(2)  with  the  left-right  symmetry.    Each  BD  is  represented  by  an  internal

symmetry group as follows.

B5: U(1),  B6: U(1),  B7: SU(2)L,  B8: U(1)R, B9: U(1)L,  B10: SU(2)R

9

The additional symmetry group, U(1) X SU(2)L, is formed by the "mixing" of U(1) in

B5  and  SU(2)L  in  B7.    This  mixing  is  same  as  in  the  standard  theory  of  the

electroweak interaction.

As in the standard theory to the electroweak interaction, the boson mixing of

U(1) and SU(2)L is to create electric charge and to generate the bosons for leptons

and quarks by combining isospin and hypercharge.   The hypercharges for both e+

and ν are 1, while for both u and d quarks, they are 1/3 [9].  The electric charges

for e+ and ν are 1 and 0, respectively, while for u and d quarks, they are 2/3 and -

1/3, respectively.

There  is  no  strong  interaction  from  the  internal  symmetry  for  the

dimensional  bosons,  originally. 

  The  strong 

interaction 

is  generated  by

"leptonization"  [10],  which  means  quarks  have  to  behave  like  leptons.    Leptons

have  integer  electric  charges  and  hypercharges,  while  quarks  have  fractional

electric charges and hypercharges.  The leptonization is to make quarks behave

like  leptons  in  terms  of  "apparent"  integer  electric  charges  and  hypercharges.

Obviously,  the  result  of  such  a  leptonization  is  to  create  the  strong  interaction,

which binds quarks together in order to make quarks to have the same "apparent"

integer electric charges and hypercharges as leptons.  There are two parts for this

strong interaction: the first part  is  for  the  charge,  and  the  second  part  is  for  the

hypercharge.  The first part of the strong interaction allows the combination of a

quark and an antiquark in a particle, so there is no fractional electric charge.  It

involves the conversion  of π1/2 boson in B6 into the electrically chargeless meson

10

field by combining two π1/2, analogous to the combination of e+ and e- fields, so the

meson field becomes chargeless.  (The mass of π, 135 MeV, is twice of the mass

of  a  half-pion  boson,  70  MeV,  minus  the  binding  energy.    π1/2  becomes

pseudoscalar up or down quark in pion.)  In the meson field, no fractional charge

of quark can appear.  The second part of the strong interaction is to combine three

quarks  in  a  particle,  so  there  is  no  fractional  hypercharge.    It  involves  the

conversion of B5 (π1/2) into the gluon field with three colors.  The number of colors

(three) in the gluon field is equal to the ratio between the lepton hypercharge and

quark hypercharge.  There are three π1/2 in the gluon field, and at any time, only

one of the three colors appears in a quark.  Quarks appear only when there is a

combination of all three colors or color-anticolor.  In the gluon field, no fractional

hypercharge of quarks can appear.  By combining both of the meson field and the

gluon  field,  the  strong  interaction  is  the  three-color  gluon  field  based  on  the

chargeless vector meson field from the combination of two π1/2's.  The total number

of π1/2 is 6, so the fine structure constant, αs, for the strong force is

1

which is in a good agreement with the observed value, 0.124 [11].

The  dimensional  boson,  B8,  is  a  CP  violating  boson,  because  B8  is

assumed to have the CP-violating U(1)R symmetry. The ratio of the force constants

between the CP-invariant WL in B8 and the CP-violating XR in B8 is

(7)

which is in the same order as the ratio of the force constants between the CP-

invariant weak interaction and the CP-violating interaction with ∆S = 2.

The dimensional boson, B9 (XL), has the CP-violating U(1)L symmetry.  The

lepton (l9) and the quark (q9) are outside of the three families for leptons and

quarks, so  baryons in dimension nine do not have to have the baryon number

conservation.  The baryon which does not conserve baryon number has the

baryon number of zero.  The combination of the CP-nonconservation and the

baryon number of zero leads to the baryon, p9

− , with the baryon number of zero

and the baryon, p9 + , with the baryon number of 1.  The decay of  p9

−  is  as

follows.

p9 −  →  l9

The combination this p9 −  and  p9

Consequently, excess baryons, n9 °, are generated in the dimension nine.  These

excess baryons, n9 ° , become the  predecessors of excess neutrons in the low

energy level.

which is in the same order as the observed ratio of the numbers between the left

handed baryons (proton or neutron) and photons in the universe.

The direct transition of the superstring to q9 without going through the last

two extra dimensions (B11, F11, B10, and F10) may account for the inflation in the

inflationary universe model [12].  This inflation may be the first of the two inflations.

The second inflation may involve the direct transition of the superstring from q7 to

the dimension four without going through the first two extra dimensions (B6 = π1/2,

F6 = e, B5 = A, and F5 = ν).  It involves the symmetry mixing between dimensions

five and seven, so the first two dimensions (π1/2, e, ν, and A) are merged with the

dimension seven, and become parts of force fields and decay modes for the

fermions (heavy leptons and baryons) of F7 with seven auxiliary dimensional orbits.

Furthermore, during this second inflation, integer charge leptons, fractional charge

quarks, the strong force field, and electroweak force field are generated.

3. The periodic table of elementary particles

Leptons and quarks are complementary to each other, expressing different

aspects of superstring.   The model for leptons and quarks is shown in Fig. 4.  The

D is the dimensional orbital number for the seven extra space dimensions.

The auxiliary dimensional orbital number, a, is for the seven extra auxiliary space

14

dimensions.   All gauge bosons, leptons, and quarks are located on the seven

dimensional orbits and seven auxiliary orbits.  Most leptons are dimensional

fermions, while all quarks are the sums of subquarks from the loops around the tori

from the compacified extra dimensions.  νe, e, νµ , and ντ  are dimensional

fermions for dimension 5, 6, 7, and 8, respectively.  All neutrinos have zero mass

because of chiral symmetry.

The dimensional fermions for D = 5 and 6 are neutrino (l5) and electron (l6).

Other fermions are generated, so there are more than one fermion in the same

dimension.  These extra fermions include quarks and heavy leptons (µ and τ).  To

generate a quark whose mass is higher than the lepton in the same dimension is

to add the lepton to the boson from the combined lepton-antilepton, so the mass of

the  quark  is  three  times  of  the  mass  of  the  corresponding  lepton  in  the  same

dimension.  The equation for the quark mass is

The mixing between the fifth and the seventh dimensional orbits which is

same as the symmetry mixing in the standard model allows the seventh

dimensional orbit to be the starting dimensional orbit for the additional orbits,

auxiliary orbits with quantum number “a.”   (The total number of the auxiliary orbits

is also seven as the seven dimensional orbits.)

A heavy lepton (µ or τ) is the combination of the dimensional leptons and

the  auxiliary  dimensional  leptons.    In  the  same  way,  a  heavy  quark  is  the

combination of the dimensional quarks from Eq.(9) and the auxiliary quarks.  The

mass  of  the  auxiliary  dimensional  fermion  (AF  for  both  heavy  lepton  and  heavy

quark) is generated from the corresponding dimensional boson as follows.

to convert the dimensional boson mass to the mass of the auxiliary dimensional

fermion  in  the  higher  dimension  by  adding  the  boson  mass  to  its  fermion  mass

which  is  one-half  of  the  boson  mass.    The  formula  for  the  mass  of  auxiliary

Each  fermion  can  be  defined  by  dimensional  numbers  (D's)  and  auxiliary

The lepton for dimension five is νe, and the quark for the same dimension is

u5, whose mass is equal to 3 Mνe from Eq. (9).  The lepton for the dimension six is

e, and the quark for this dimension is d6.  u5 and d6 represent the “light quarks” or

“current quarks” which have low masses.  The dimensional lepton for the

dimensions seven is νµ.   All ν's become massless by the chiral symmetry to

preserve chirality.  The auxiliary dimensional leptons (Al) in the dimension seven

are µ7 and τ7 whose masses can be calculated by Eq. (13) derived from Eq. (11).

and the mass of τ is the sum of e + τ7, as in Eq.(12).

For  heavy  quarks,  q7  (the  dimensional  fermion,  F7,  for  quarks  in  the

dimension  seven)  is  3µ  instead  of  massless  3ν  as  in  Eq.  (9).    According  to  the

quarks, Aq7,a , is as follows.

The dimensional lepton for the dimension eight is ντ , whose mass is zero to

preserve chirality.  The heavy lepton for the dimensional eight is µ‘ as the sum of e,

µ, and µ8 (auxiliary dimensional lepton).  Because there are only three families for

leptons, µ' is the extra lepton, which is "hidden".  µ' can appear only as µ + photon.

The  pairing  of  µ  +  µ  from  the  hidden  µ'  and  regular  µ  may  account  for  the

occurrence of same sign dilepton in the high energy level [14].  For the dimension

19

eight, q8 (the F8 for quarks) is µ' instead of 3µ', because the hiding of µ' allows q8 to

be µ'.  The hiding of µ' for leptons is balanced by the hiding of b8 for quarks.

The  calculated  masses  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  observed

constituent masses of leptons and quarks [2,15].  The mass of the top quark found

by  Collider  Detector  Facility  is  176  ±  13  GeV  [2]  in  a  good  agreement  with  the

calculated value, 176.5 GeV.

Hadrons

As molecules are the composites of atoms, hadrons are the composites of

elementary particles.   Hadron can be represented by elementary particles in many

different ways.   One way to represent hadron is through the nonrelativistic

constituent quark model where the mass of a hadron is the sum of the masses of

quarks plus a relatively small binding energy.   π1/2 (u or d pseudoscalar quark), u,

d, s, c, b, and t quarks mentioned above are nonrelativistic constituent quarks.  On

the other hand, except proton and neutron, all hadrons are unstable, and decay

eventually into low-mass quarks and leptons.   Is a hadron represented by all

nonrelativistic quarks or by low-mass quarks and leptons?   This paper proposes a

dual formula: the full quark formula for all nonrelativistic constituent quarks (π1/2, u,

d, s, c, and b) and the basic fermion formula for the lowest- mass quark (π1/2 and

u) and lepton (e).   The calculation of the masses of hadrons requires both

formulas.  The full quark formula sets the initial mass for a hadron.  This initial

mass is matched by the mass resulted from the combination of various particles

20

in the basic fermion formula.  The mass of a hadron is the mass plus the binding

energy in the basic fermion formula.

M full quark formula ≈ M basic fermion formula

M hadron = M basic fermion formula  + binding energy

(15)

The full quark formula consists of the vector quarks (u, d, s, c, and b) and

pseudoscalar quark, π1/2 (70.03 MeV), which is B6 (dimension boson in the

dimension six).  The strong interaction converts B6 (π1/2) into pseudoscalar u and

d quark in pseudoscalar π meson.  The combination of the pseudoscalar quark

(π1/2) and vector quarks (q) results in hybrid quarks (q' ) whose mass is the

average mass of pseudoscalar quark and vector quark.

Mq'   =  1/2 ( Mq + Mπ1/2)

(16)

Hybrid quarks include u', d', and s' whose masses are 200.398, 201.164, and

314.148 MeV, respectively.  For baryons other than n and p, the full quark

formula is the combination of vector quarks, hybrid quarks (u' and d'), and

pseudoscalar quark (π1/2).  For example, Λ° (uds) is u'd's3, where 3 denotes 3

π1/2.   For pseudoscalar mesons (J = 0), the full quark formula is the combination

of π1/2  and q' (u', d' and s') or π1/2   alone.  For vector mesons (J > 0), the full

quark formula is the combination of vector quarks (u, d, s, c, and b) and π1/2 .   

For examples, π° is 2, η (1295,J =0) is u'u'd'd'8, and K1 (1400, J=1) is ds8.   The

compositions of hadrons from the particles of the full quark formula are listed in

Table 4.

       Different energy states in hadron spectroscopy are the results of

differences in the numbers of π1/2.   The higher the energy state, the higher the

number of π1/2.  The number of π1/2 attached to q or q' in the full quark formula is

restricted.  The number of π1/2 can be 0, ±1, ±3, ±4, ±7, and ±3n (n>2).   This is

the “π1/2 series.”  The number, 3, is indicative of a baryon-like (3 quarks in a

baryon) number.  The number, 4, is the combination of 1 and 3, while the

number, 7, is the combination of 3 and 4.  Since π1/2 is essentially pseudoscalar

u and d quarks, the π1/2 series is closely related to u and d quarks.   Since s is

close to u and d, the π1/2 series is also related to s quark. . Each presence of u,

d, and s associates with one single π1/2 series.  The single π1/2 series associates

with baryons and the mesons with uu dd ss, ss, dc, uc, db, ub, sc, and

sb.  The combination of two single π1/2 series is the double π1/2 series (0, ±2, ±6,

22

±8, ±14, and ±6n) associating with ud and ds mesons.  For the mesons (cc

and bb) without u, d, or s, the numbers of π1/2 attached to quarks can be from

the single π1/2 series or the double π1/2 series.

The basic fermion formula is similar to M. H. MacGregor's light quark

model  [17], whose calculated masses and the predicted properties of hadrons

are in very good agreement with observations.    In the light quark model, the

mass building blocks are the "spinor" (S with mass 330.4 MeV) and the mass

quantum (mass = 70MeV).  S has 1/2 spin and neutral charge, while the basic

quantum has zero spin and neutral charge.  For the basic fermion formula, S is

u, the quark with the lowest mass (330.77 MeV), and the basic quantum is π1/2

(mass = 70.025 MeV).  In the basic fermion formula, u and π1/2 have the same

spins and charge as S and the basic quantum, respectively.  For examples, in

the basic fermion formula, neutron is SSS, and K1 (1400, J=1) is S2 11, where S2

denotes two S, and 11 denotes 11 π1/2 's.

In additional to S and π1/2, the basic fermion formula includes P (positive

charge) and N (neutral charge) with the masses of proton and neutron.   As in

the light quark model, the mass associated with positive or negative charge is the

electromagnetic mass, 4.599 MeV, which is nine times the mass of electron.

This mass (nine times the mass of electron) is derived from the baryon-like

electron that represents three quarks in a baryon and three electron in d6 quark

as in Table 2.  This electromagnetic mass is observed in the mass difference

23

between π° (2) and π+ (2+) where + denotes positive charge.  The calculated

mass different is one electromagnetic mass, 4.599 MeV, in good agreement with

the observed mass difference, 4.594 MeV, between π° and π+.   (The values for

observed masses are taken from "Particle Physics Summary "[18].)  The

particles in the basic fermion formula are listed in Table 5.

Hadrons are the composites of quarks as molecules composing of atoms.

As  atoms  are  bounded  together  by  chemical  bonds,  hadrons  are  bounded  by

“hadronic bonds,” connecting the particles in the basic fermion formula.  These

hadronic bonds are similar to the hadronic bonds in the light quark model.

The hadronic bonds are the overlappings of the auxiliary dimensional

orbits.  As in Eq (11), the energy derived from the auxiliary orbit for S (u quark) is

Ea 

= (3/2) (3 Mµ) αw

= 14.122 MeV

(17)

The auxiliary orbit is a charge - dipole interaction in a circular orbit as described by

A. Barut [13], so a fermion for the circular orbit and an electron for the charge are

embedded in this hadronic bond.  The fermion for the circular orbit is the

supersymmetrical fermion for the auxiliary dimensional orbit according to Eq (2).

M f 

= Ea αw

24

(18)

The binding energy (negative energy) for the bond (S!S) between two S's is

twice of 14.122 MeV minus the masses of the supersymmetrical fermion and

electron.

E S -S  = - 2 (Ea - Mf - Me) 

= -26.384 MeV

(19)

It is similar to the binding energy (-26 MeV) in the light quark model.  An example

of S!S bond is in neutron (S − S − S) which has two S − S bonds.  The mass of

neutron can be calculated as follows.

Mn  =  3MS + 2ES-S

=  939.54 MeV,

(20)

which is in excellent agreement with the observed mass, 939.57 MeV.  The mass

of proton is the mass of neutron minus the mass difference (three times of

electron mass = M3e) between u and d quark as shown in Table 2.  Proton is

represented as S − S − (S -3e).  The calculation of the mass of proton is as

follows.

Ea  for (S-3e) = (3/2) (3 (Mµ - M3e)) αw

M f 

Mp

= Ea αw

= 2 MS + M(S-3e) + ES!S + ES!(S-3e)

= 938.21 MeV

(21)

The calculated mass is in a good agreement with the observed mass, 938.27

MeV.

The binding energy for π1/2 − π1/2 bond can be derived in the same way as

Eqs (17), (18), and (19).

25

Ea  = (3/2) Mπ1/2  αw

M f  = Ea αw

E π1/2 - π1/2  = - 2 (Ea - Mf - Me)

= -5.0387 MeV

(22)

It is similar to the binding energy (-5 MeV) in the light quark model.  An example

for the binding energy of π1/2 − π1/2 bond is in π°.  The mass of π° can be

calculated as follows.

Mπ° = 2 Mπ1/2 + E π1/2 - π1/2

= 135.01 MeV.

(23)

The calculated mass of π° is in excellent agreement with the observed value,

134.98 MeV.   There is one π1/2 − π1/2 bond per pair of π1/2 ‘s, so there are two π1/2

− π1/2  bonds for 4 π1/2 ‘s, and three π1/2 − π1/2  bonds for 6 π1/2 ‘s. 

Another bond is N − π1/2 or P − π1/2, the bond between neutron or proton

and π1/2.  Since N is SSS, N − π1/2 bond is derived from S − π1/2.   The binding

energy of S − π1/2 is the average between S−S and π1/2 − π1/2.

E S - π1/2 = 1/2 ( ES-S + E π1/2 - π1/2)

(24)

An additional dipole (e +e -) is needed to connected S − π1/2 to neutron.

E N - π1/2 

= E S - π1/2 + 2 Me

=  - 14.689 MeV.

(25)

26

It is similar to -15 MeV in the light quark model.  An example for  P − π1/2 is Σ+

which is represented by P4 whose structure is 2 − P − 2.  The 4 π1/2 's are

connected to P with two P − π1/2 bonds.  The mass of Σ+ is as follows.

MΣ

+  = MP + 4 Mπ1/2 + 2 E N - π1/2 

= 1189.0 MeV.

(26)

The calculated mass is in a good agreement with the observed mass, 1189.4 ±

0.07 MeV.

There is N – N hadronic bond between two N’s.  N has the structure of S –

S – S.  N – N has a hexagonal structure shown in Fig 5.

S

S

S

Fig 5.  The structure of N - N

There are two additional S – S for each N.  The total number of S – S bonds

between two N’s is 4.  An example is Ω°c (ssc) which has the basic fermion

formula of N 2 S9 with the structure of 3 – N – N – 6 S.  The mass of Ω°c can be

calculated as follows.

M 

=  2MN + MS + 9Mπ1/2 + 4 ES – S + 2 E N - π1/2

= 2705.3 MeV

(27)

27

The calculated mass for  Ω°c is in a good agreement with the observed mass

(2704 ± 4 MeV).  For baryons other than p and n, there are two or three N - π1/2

or P - π1/2 bonds per baryon.  It is used to distinguish J = ½ and J≥ 3/2.  For J =

½ which have asymmetrical spins (two up and one down), there are two bonds

for three S in a baryon to represent the asymmetrical spins.  For J≥ 3/2, there are

three bonds for three S in a baryon except if there is only one π1/2, only two

bonds exists for a baryon.

Among the particles in the basic fermion formula, there are hadronic

bonds, but not all particles have hadronic bonds.  In the basic fermion formula,

hadronic bonds appear only among the particles that relate to the particles in the

corresponding full quark formula.  The related particles are the “core” particles

that have hadronic bonds, and the unrelated particles are “filler” particles that

have no hadronic bonds.  In the basic fermion formula, for baryons other than p

and n, the core particles are P, N, and π1/2.  For the mesons consisting of u and d

quarks, the core particles are π1/2, S, and N.  For the mesons containing one u,

d, or s  along with s, c, or b, the core particles are S and N, and no hadronic

bond exist among π1/2's , which are the filler particles.  For the mesons (cc and

bb), the only hadronic bond is N − N.  The occurrences of hadronic bonds are

listed in Table 6.

An example is the difference between π and f0.   The decay modes of f0

include the mesons of s quarks from K meson.  Consequently, there is no π1/2 -

π1/2 for f0.  The basic fermion formula for f0 is 14.  The mass of f0 is as follows.

M  

=  14Mπ1/2

=  980.4 MeV

The observed mass is 980 ± 10 MeV.

(28)

In additional to the binding energies for hadronic bonds, hadrons have

Coulomb energy (-1.2 MeV) between positive and negative charges and

magnetic binding energy (±2MeV per interaction) for S − S from the light quark

model [17].   In the light quark model, the dipole moment of a hadron can be

calculated from the magnetic binding energy.  Since in the basic fermion formula,

magnetic binding energy becomes a part of hadronic binding energy as shown in

Eq (19), magnetic binding energy for other baryons is the difference in magnetic

binding energy between a baryon and n or p.  If a baryon has a similar dipole

29

moment as p or n, there is no magnetic binding energy for the baryon.  An

example for Coulomb energy and magnetic binding energy is Λ (uds, J=1/2)

whose formula is P3- with the structure of 2 − P − 1- where "-" denotes negative

charge.  The dipole moment of Λ is –6.13 µN, while the dipole moment of proton

(P) is 2.79 µN [18].  According to the light quark model, this difference in dipole

moment represents -6 MeV magnetic binding energy.  The Coulomb energy

between the positive charge P and the negative charge 1- is –1.2 MeV.  The

electromagnetic mass for 1- is 4.599 MeV.  The mass of Λ is calculated as

follows.

MΛ 

= MP + 3Mπ1/2 +  Me.m. + 2 E N - π1/2 + Emag + Ecoul

= 1116.4 MeV

(29)

The observed mass is 1115.7 ± 0.0006 MeV.

An example of the dual representation of the full quark formula and the

basic fermion formula as expressed by Eq. (15) is Λ (uds).  The full quark

formula for Λ is u’d’s’3 with mass of 1169.9 MeV.  This mass is matched by the

mass of the basic fermion formula, P3- with the mass of 1152.9 MeV.  The final

mass of Λ is 1152.9 MeV plus the various binding energies.

Table 7 is the results of calculation for the masses of baryons selected

from Ref. (18). The hadrons selected are the hadrons with precise observed

masses and known quantum states such as isospin and spin.

The full quark formula for baryons other than p and n involves hybrid

quarks (u’ and d’), vector quarks (s, c, and b), and pseudoscalar quark (π1/2 ).

The whole spectrum of baryons (other than p and n) follows the single π1/2 series

with  0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 3n.  π1/2 is closely related to u and d, so the lowest energy

state baryons (Λand Σ) that contain low mass quark and high number of u or d

have high number of π1/2. .  On the contrary, the lowest energy state baryons (Ω,

Ωc, and Λb) that contain high mass quarks and no or low number of u and d have

low number of π1/2 or no π1/2.   π1/2 's are added to the lowest energy state baryons

to form the high-energy state baryons.

The basic fermion formula includes P, N, S, and π1/2.  If the dominant

decay mode includes p, the basic fermion formula includes P.  If the dominant

decay mode includes n, the basic fermion formula includes N.   If the decay

mode does not include either n or p directly, the baryon with the dipole moment

similar to p or n has the basic fermion formula with P or N, respectively.  If the

dipole moment is not known, the designation of P or N for the higher energy

state baryon follows the designation of P or N for the corresponding lower energy

The full quark formulas for light unflavored mesons are different for

different decay modes.  There are three different types of the full quark formula

for light unflavored mesons.   Firstly, when the decay mode is all leptons or all

mesons with u and d quarks, the full quark formula consists of π1/2, u’, d’, u, and d

quarks,  Secondly, when u, d, and leptons are in the major decay modes, and s

is in the minor decay modes, the full quark formula consists of π1/2, u’, d’, s’, u, d,

and s quarks.  The most common full quark formula for such mesons is uds,

which is essentially ½ (uu dd ss).  Finally, when s quarks are in the major or

all decay mode, the full quark formula consists of π1/2 ‘s and s quarks.  When J =

0, the full quark formula includes π1/2 ‘s and hybrid quarks (u’, d’, and s’).  When J

> 0, the full quark formula includes π1/2 ‘s and vector quarks (u, d, and s).  Since

there are double presence of u and d quarks for the full quark formula with u and

d quark, it follows the double π1/2 series: 0, 2, 6, 8, 14, and 6n.  The full quark

formula with odd presence of u, d, and s follows the single π1/2 series: 0, ±1, ±3,

±4, ±7, and ±3n.

The basic fermion formula includes π1/2 ‘s, S, and N.   π1/2 − π1/2 hadronic

bond exists in the full quark formula with u and d quarks, and does not exist in

the full quark formula with s quark.  S − S bond exists in all formula.  Light

unflavored mesons decay into symmetrical low mass mesons, such as  2γ, 3πo,

and π02γ from η,  or asymmetrical  high and low mass mesons, such as

asymmetrical π+πη, ρ0γ, and π0π0η from η’ . To distinguish the asymmetrical

34

decay modes from the symmetrical decay modes, one “counter π1/2 − π1/2

hadronic bond” is introduced in η’ [17].  The binding energy for the counter π1/2 −

π1/2 hadronic bond is 5.04 MeV, directly opposite to –5.04 MeV for the π1/2 − π1/2

hadronic bond.  All light unflavored mesons with asymmetrical decay modes

include this counter π1/2 − π1/2  hadronic bonds.  For an example, the mass of η’

(14+-) is calculated as follows.

Mη’ 

= 14 Mπ1/2  + 2 Me.m. + Ee.m. +  7Eπ1/2 − π1/2  - Eπ1/2 − π1/2  

= 958.2 MeV

(30)

The observed mass is 957.8 ± 0.14 MeV.

The result of the mass calculation for the mesons consisting of u, d, or s

with s, c, or b is listed in Table 9.

The full quark formula for these mesons contains π1/2’s, u’, d’, s’, u, d, s, c,

and b.  The full quark formula for the mesons with J = 0 contains π1/2, hybrid

36

quarks (u’, d’, and s’), c, and b quarks.  The full quark formula with J > 0 contains

π1/2’s and vector quarks (u, d, s, c, and b).  Strange mesons have double

presence of d and s, so it follows the double π1/2 series.  All other mesons have

single presence of u, d, or s, so they follow the single π1/2 series.  The basic

fermion formula consists of π1/2’s, S, and N.  There is no π1/2 − π1/2  bond.  There

are S − S and N − N bonds.  For example, the mass of Bs (N5 S3) is calculated as

follows.

M

= 5MN + 3MS + (10+ 2) MS−S

= 5373.5 MeV

(31)

There are 10 S − S bonds for N5 (two S − S bonds for each N) and 2 S − S

bonds for S3.   The observed mass is 5369.3  ± 2 MeV.

The result of mass calculation for cc and bb mesons is listed in Table

The full quark formula contains c or b.  Since it contains no u, d, or s related

to π1/2, it follows a mixed π1/2 series from both the single π1/2 series and the double

π1/2 series.  Since c and b are high mass quarks unlike the low mass u and d

quarks that relate to π1/2, the π1/2 series actually starts from a negative π1/2.  The

basic fermion formula contains π1/2’s, S, and N.  The only hadronic bond is N − N.

38

An example is J/ψ (N2 S4) whose mass (3096.9 ± 0.04 MeV) is calculated as

follows.

M

= 2 MN + 4 MS + 4 MS−S

= 3096.7 MeV

Conclusion

The periodic table of elementary particles is derived from S-duality between

the eleven  dimensional membrane and dual lepton-quark superstring (Fig. 1), U-

duality between the superstring and solitonic string (Fig. 2), and T-duality between

Type II string and compacified string. (Fig. 3).  The periodic table of elementary

particles (Fig. 4 and Table 2) is constructed from the Kaluza-Klein substructure.

All leptons, quarks, and gauge bosons can be placed in the periodic table.  The

masses of elementary particles can be calculated using only four known constants:

the number of the extra spatial dimensions in the eleven dimensional membrane,

the mass of electron, the mass of Z°, and αe.  The calculated masses (Tables 1

and 3) of elementary particles derived from the periodic table are in good

agreement with the observed values.  For an example, the calculated mass (176.5

GeV) of the top quark has an excellent agreement with the observed mass (176 ±

13 GeV).

A hadron can be represented by the full quark formula (Table 4) and the

basic quark formula (Table 5).   The full quark formula consists of all quarks,

pseudoscalar quark in pion, and the hybrid quarks.  The basic quark formula

39

consists of the lowest mass quarks.   The relation between these two formulas is

expressed by Eq. (15).  As a molecule is the composite of atoms with chemical

bonds, a hadron is the composite of elementary particles with "hadronic bonds"

(Table 6) which are the overlappings of the auxiliary dimensional orbits.   The

calculated masses (Tables 7, 8, 9, and 10) of hadrons are in good agreement with

the observed values.  For examples, the calculated masses for neutron and pion

are 939.54 and 135.01MeV in excellent agreement with the observed masses,

939.57 and 134.98 MeV, respectively. 

The overall average difference between

the calculated masses and the observed masses for all hadrons (110 hadrons) is

0.29 MeV, and the standard deviation for such differences is 5.06 MeV.  The

average observed error for the masses of the hadrons is ± 6.41 MeV.  The periodic

table of elementary particles provides the most comprehensive explanation and

calculation for the masses of elementary particles and hadrons.

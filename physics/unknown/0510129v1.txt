Abstract

As   an   application   of   the   solution   of   the   equations   of   electromagnetic   self-

consistency in a plasma, found in a previous paper, the study of controlled thermo-

nuclear   fusion   is   undertaken.   This   study   utilizes   the   resonance   which   can   be

developed in the plasma, as indicated by the above solution, and is  based to an

analysis of the underlying forced oscillation under friction. As a consequence, we

find that, in this way, controlled thermonuclear fusion seems now to be feasible in

principle. The treatment is rather elementary, and it may serve as a guide for more

detailed calculations.

1. Introduction and the basic idea

The solution of the equations of electromagnetic self-consistency in a plasma,

mentioned  below in section  2, may help in heating a homogeneous  plasma in a

plasma reactor until the plasma reaches the high temperatures necessary for fusion

nuclear reactions to take place. Up to now the heating is based mainly on the pinch

effect. In this way it is possible to adiabatically compress inward the plasma, which

collapses   toward   the   axis   of   the   cylindrical   plasma   column   involved.   The

temperatures   so   reached  are   indeed   high   enough   for   fusion   nuclear   reactions   to

begin, but this mechanism contains in itself a great disadvantage: it lasts only for an

extremely  short   interval   of   time.   Exactly  this   can   be   overcome   by  the   method

described below.

If we are given a cylindrical column of (homogeneous) plasma of length d, as in

Fig.1, we place two spirals at its ends, and we supply them with two alternating

currents i & i of the same direction, as in the figure, of suitable (cyclic) frequency ω,

such that standing waves of  H, with nodes at the ends and antinode in the middle,

3

are created. Thus resonance results in the space of the plasma, between the spirals,

concerning   the   field   intensity  H.   This   intensity  results   of   course   from   a   vector

potential A, which of course will be also in resonance inside the column. Because

,                                                                                                                   (1.1)

=

and because of the positions of the spirals, H and A will be as in the figure.

Then, because of (29) and (44) of ref. [7], the plasma can be said to be “excited”

and two streams of particles (namely ions and electrons) of opposite velocities will

be generated, which both will move in circles rotationally oscillating in this way

about the axis of the cylinder (see Fig.1), since their velocities v+ and v- are collinear

to A. Thus, collisions of electrons with ions (protons) will take place continuously,

resulting in heating the plasma inside the column.

Equating the  right   hand  sides   of  formulae   (43)   and  (45)  of  ref.  [7],  we  can

determine the resonance frequency at which the resonance takes place, by setting k ”

 .                                                                             (1.2)

This frequency falls, for usual dimensions (λ » 1m), in the limits of radio-waves with

2π/λ = π/d (d = λ/2). The result is

3. Description of the potential & the external force

We will use for convenience cylindrical coordinates (ρ,  φ, z), taking as the z-

axis the axis of the cylinder and the origin of coordinates in the middle between the

spirals (see Fig.2). Because H is almost  in  the  z-direction  between  the  spirals,

Then, the velocity of the organized motion of protons and electrons will be (cf.

The internal friction in the plasma is due to the relative (organized) motion of

protons and electrons under the influence of the oscillating potential. We have for

the velocity of protons with respect to electrons

The settlement time is a measure of the time required for the steady solution

(particular solution) of eqn. (5.1) to be established. This is the time required for the

non-steady solution  (the general solution of  the homogeneous  equation  resulting

from (5.1)) to fall to e-1 times its initial value. It equals therefore to the inverse of the

damping   coefficient  λ,   that   is   1/λ  [13].   Since  λ  may   change   from   protons   to

electrons, we will have from (6.5), if we take also into account eqn. (4.10), the

With the values of our arithmetic example, we find that 1/λ @

 300 sec = 5 min.

The   mean   free   path   of   the   colliding   protons   and   electrons,   before

homogenization of the velocities (“thermalization”), is [14]

 8· 1010 m and  M.F.T. @

 152 sec =

2.5 min.

We have to consider this mean free time as a measure of the thermalization time

(“time of relaxation”), after which T´–  = T–  (the actual temperatures of protons and

electrons), since it indicates that after this time almost all protons have collided with

8. Thermonuclear energy released

We are now interested in collisions of protons with protons. Of course this will

result in fusion, after thermalization at T+ ~

 107 deg, a temperature required in order

for fusion nuclear reactions to begin. If the cross-section for p-p fusion is σpp and v

denotes  thermal  velocity,  then   the   number   of   collisions   of   a   proton   with   other

protons will be σppv+rmsN. This (assuming σpp ~

 σpe) results in 6.3· 10-6 sec-1 collisions

If we add to 0.42 MeV the energy released by the annihilation of the positron, we

gain totally 1.44 MeV from each pair p-p. Thus, we find for the energy release
Energy release Rate 1.44 MeV,                                                                          (8.4)

9. Rate of temperature increase

After settlement has been established, the energy consumed will equal the heat

produced by dissipation [13]. This will be evidently equal to the rate of increase of

the   energy   content   of   the     plasma.   Assuming   that   the   plasma   temperature   T–

corresponds to T´–   after homogenization of the velocities, we may thus write

For the arithmetic example, we have I+(0) ~

 9.5· 10-12 erg/sec. If we want to find

the time it takes the plasma to thermalize at  T+ = 107 deg, we have to use (9.1), so

that this time is

We get thus for the thermalization time t ~

time and thermalization time) are of the same order of magnitude, that is of a few

where ε(t) is a small perturbation, and we demand that (11.6) is a solution of (11.1).

Then  we  will  examine  the  behavior  of  ε(t)  as  t  increases,   namely whether   it  is

growing or decaying. Inserting (11.6) in (11.1) instead of φ, we find that the terms in

φ cancel each other by means of the unperturbed eqn. (11.1), so that we are left with

ε(t) having to satisfy the homogeneous eqn. (11.2) if we place it in the position of φ.

That is ε(t) has to satisfy the equation

that is ε is decaying and therefore the solution (11.5) for φ is stable.

12. Discussion

Of course in a fusion machine we will not have only one “cell” (with two spirals

at its ends) of length d (see Fig.1), but many such cells placed successively one by

the   other.   If   the   whole   configuration   is   linear,   the   plasma   can   of   course   be

successfully confined in the direction of ρ by the static homogeneous magnetic field

due to a suitable coil surrounding the curved surface of the resulting long cylinder,

carrying the appropriate direct current. There is a problem only at the two bases of

the configuration. Of course we can appropriately modify the coil at the two ends of

the whole cylinder so that two magnetic mirrors are formed at the two bases of the

so-formed magnetic bottle. But we can by no  way achieve a perfect reflection of the

plasma on these two magnetic mirrors, since we will always have an even small

escape of the plasma particles there. We can however “bend” this configuration and

identify the two bases, so as for the cylinder to form a torus. In this way it is clear

that there will be no escape at all, since now all of the plasma particles will move

indefinitely inside the torus. It is also evident that the preceding analysis will be

approximately valid concerning the torus, the better the smaller curvature along the

torus, that is the better the longer the big radius of the torus is.

In the steady state of operation of the machine the energy consumed at resonance

I(0) will dissipate inside the torus maintaining the plasma heated and so supporting

the fusion. But it is  not  lost. We will finally take it again at the “output” of the

machine§ together with the heat resulted by the fusion. If then we use the former in

order to (almost) take again the initial current I required, it is obvious that the energy

released (e.r.) by the fusion will be (almost) the net gain of energy.

Of course the yield of the machine will be the better the larger the ratio (e.r.)/I(0)

is. In our arithmetic example the yield is not so good. But we have to observe that

(from  eqns.  (6.7)  and  (5.21))   I(0)  (cid:181)

  N,  while  (see  §8)  e.r.  (cid:181)

  N2.  Thus  we can

improve the yield by just increasing N. Then we will also have (from eqn. (5.21)) I0

 N, while (from eqns. (10.6), (10.5) and (10.4)) in* (cid:181)

 (cid:214) N. Thus increasing N does

not have a strong effect on increasing in* as well. For example if we increase N by a

factor of 100, we will be required to increase in* by a factor of only 10, but  we will

take a (thermo-nuclear) energy release increased by a factor of 10000 (please apply

this to our arithmetic example).

Another   issue   with   which   we   will   be   confronted   in   the   design   and   real

construction of such a machine has to do with how to stabilize the temperature of

§ Of course part of I(0) is converted to bremsstrahlung energy, but it is also not lost because it will be

absorbed by the surrounding walls of the reactor, being finally converted to heat.

(cid:181)
22

the plasma inside the reactor, at T+  = 107  (cid:176) K say, preventing it  from increasing

more%.   Suppose   that   the   plasma   torus,   of   short   radius   r0  and   long  radius   R,   is

surrounded by a concave toroidal layer of material, of thickness l, which is a bad

conductor   of   heat,   of   a   coefficient   of   thermal   conduction  κ  (e.g.  κ  =   0.0004).

Suppose also that  the whole system of the plasma torus with its material cover is

embedded in a tank filled with water.

Let the outer surface of the plasma, of area S1 , which is approximately the same

with the inner surface of the surrounding material, have a temperature T1. Let also

the outer surface of the material, of area S2  , have a temperature T2, which is the

same with the temperature of the water. Then the heat excess (per unit time) Q/t =[I

(0)+(e.r.)]V of the plasma torus will be transferred by conduction from S1  to S2,

being absorbed finally by the water. Then, for the heat flow (which will be the same

with [I(0)+(e.r.)]V in the steady state we examine) Q/t, we will have, from the law

,                                                                                                       (12.1)

where S is the area of a surface (inside the material) perpendicular to the direction of

(heat) flow and dT/dx is the temperature gradient inside the material. Writing eqn.

% Of course T–  cannot become greater than T´–  , its cause, the fusion reactions kept apart (the heat

excess, due to I– (0), must be necessarily dissipated outside the reactor). But right because of these

fusion reactions, when they begin, the temperatures T–  will undoubtedly increase, if we do not take

care of it.

In our arithmetic example, take r0 = 1 m, T1-T2 ~

 107 °K, and κ = 0.0004 cal  sec-

Thus T1 can be stabilized (see Appendix at the end) because T2 remains constant

will make the turbine to operate in order for electricity to be finally produced).

In our case we take r0 = 100 cm, l = 736 cm, κ = 0.0004 cal sec-1 cm-1 grad-1, and

T0 = 107 (cid:176) K. We then find from (A3) that (e.r.)0 @

But we can find the derivative d(e.r.)/dT from the function e.r. = f(T), since in

reality e.r. depends on the temperature (see Fig.5). In fact, from eqns. (8.4) and

(here A = ½). We find in our case, from (A10), that b = 22.2  (cid:214) (keV). We thus

finally find from (A9) that σpp(107 °K) @

 2· 10-10 barn = 2· 10-34 cm2. Now, from (A7)

we see that N2σpp  is constant. And, since for  σpp ~

  10-25  cm2  we have found above

that N @

 1014 cm-3, we see that for σpp @

 2· 10-34 cm2 we must take N @

 2.2· 1018 cm-3.

With these values of  σpp  and N, along with T = T0  = 107  (cid:176) K, we find thus finally

from (A8) that d(e.r.)/dT @

 3.5· 10-4 (W/m3) deg-1.

at T = T0 for a small increment of e.r., then the equilibrium at T = T0 is stable (see

Fig.5). Otherwise it is unstable. Hopefully, we can always secure inequality (A12)

by  appropriately  varying   the   parameters   of   our   problem.   Here   inequality  (A12)

largely holds, since δ(e.r.)/δT = 0.15 (W/m3) deg-1 and d(e.r.)/dT = 0.00034 (W/m3)

Comment

In   §12   and   in   the   Appendix   we   used   a   temperature   T1  as   indicating   the

temperature of the plasma. But our (almost) collisionless plasma is characterized by

two temperatures: T  ”

  T+  & T´  ”

  T-  =1836 T+  . Nevertheless, collisions certainly

occur between protons and electrons at a density of ~

 1018 cm-3 , with the result for

the two temperatures to converge  (slowly)  to a unique tempetarure between them.

Quoting [14]: “The large difference between the electron mass m and the ion mass

M impedes the transfer of energy between electrons and ions: when a heavy and a

light particle collide, the energy of each is almost unchanged. The establishment of

equilibrium   among   the   electrons   alone   an   the   ions   alone   therefore   takes   place

considerably more quickly than that between electrons and ions. This may easily

give rise to a situation where the electron and ion components of the plasma each

28

have a Maxwelllian distribution but with different temperatures Te and Ti , of which

The equations governing the change of T and T´ are [14]

                                                                                                             (C1)

Remark

If S0 is the outer surface of the plasma and T0 its temperature, and S1 is the inner

surface of the covering concave torus with T1 the temperature at the location of S1, it

is meant that S0 = S1 and T0 = T1 in the main text. But in reality this cannot be the

case. In fact, no material can exist at the temperature of the plasma without melting.

Thus we have to consider the transfer of heat power Q/t from S0 to S1 by radiation.

We have then from the Stefan-Boltzmann law [3] that

.                                                                                         (R1)

we can find the actual T1, from the combination of (R1) with (R2), which of course

must be much less than T0 ~

 107 °K. It can be so possible for the material torus to

consist of a ceramic material, for example.

We set r0 = 1 m, T0 = 107 °K, σ = 5.7· 10-8 W/(m2grad4). Then, even if we take I

(0) = 3.3· 1010 W/m3 and (e.r.) = 3.4· 1012 W/m3, we find r1T1

4 = 1028 m grad4, so that

for T1  = 1500 °K we obtain r1  = 2· 1015  m ! Thus, we have to (at last analysis)

increase N much more (than N = 2.2· 1018 cm-3) in order to increase I(0) ((cid:181)

in particular, (e.r) ((cid:181)

(of the same order). Then we find that, since I(0) + (e.r.) is of the same order to (e.r.)

(I(0) ~

 0), we must take (e.r.) ~

 1.14· 1021 W/m3 (*). If we increase N by a factor of

104 (corresponding to N = 2.2· 1022 cm-3), we have to multiply I(0) by 104, and (e.r.)

by 108. We take thus I(0) = 3.3· 1014 W/m3 and (e.r.) = 3.4· 1020 W/m3. (§)

The total heat produced by these reactions is 24.89 MeV, that is 17.28 times greater

than 1.44 MeV used up to now. Thus, if we multiply (§) by the same factor (17.28),

we obtain (e.r.) = 5.9· 1021  W/m3  ($), exceeding the value (*) required. In other

words we can increase (e.r.) to the necessary value without increasing N more, by

just taking account of the actual reactions taking place in the reactor.

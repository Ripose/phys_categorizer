Abstract 

Lobster-ISS is a revolutionary astrophysical X-ray all-sky monitor scheduled for deployment as 
an attached payload on the International Space Station (ISS) in 2009.  Using a new wide field-of-
view focusing optic, Lobster-ISS provides an order-of-magnitude improvement in the sensitivity 
of all-sky monitors in the soft X-ray band (0.1 – 3.0 keV).  This lobster-eye optic presents unique 
challenges  to  the  imaging  X-ray  detector  at  its  focus.    Micro-patterned  imaging  proportional 
counters, with their mechanical simplicity and high performance are the most practical means of 
meeting  the  requirements.    We  describe  our  design  for  the  Lobster-ISS  X-ray  imaging  detector 
based on direct-imaging micro-well proportional counters and the expected performance.

the array are brought to a true central focus a 
distance  R/2  along 
the  symmetry  axis, 
provided 
they  undergo  odd  numbers  of 
grazing incidence reflections from orthogonal 
channel walls.   

1. The Lobster-ISS detector requirements 

The  Lobster-ISS  instrument  consists  of  a 
set  of  six  identical  X-ray  telescopes  mounted 
on the zenith-pointing external platform of the 
ISS’s  Columbus  module.    Each  telescope 
covers  a  27  x  22.5  square  degree  field-of-
view.    The  instrument’s  total  instantaneous 
field-of-view  is  therefore  162  x  22.5  square 
degrees.  With  the  combination  of  the  wide 
field-of-view in one direction and the motion 
of  the  ISS  in  the  other,  Lobster-ISS  maps 
almost  the  entire  sky  every  90  minutes.  With 
an angular resolution of four arc minutes, this 
will generate a confusion-limited catalogue of 
about 250,000 sources every two months.

in  practice  with  square-pore  micro-channel

The  challenge  for  the  X-ray  detector  at 
the  focus  is  then  clear:  covering  a  large, 
spherical  focal  surface  with  high-resolution 
imaging.    In  Lobster-ISS,  each  of  the  six 
telescopes  has  a  75  cm  radius  of  curvature 
with  a  40  x  40  cm2  area.    The  focal  surface 
then  has  a  radius  of  37.5  cm  with  an  area  of 
20  x  20  cm2.  To  achieve  the  desired  4  arc 
minute resolution, the total focal spot must be 
0.4 mm or less (FWHM).  With an expected 3 
arc  minute  spot  from  the  optics,  the  detector 
must  have  image  resolution  better  than  about 
250  microns  (FWHM)  over  the  0.1  –  3keV 
bandpass.

Each of the six Lobster-ISS telescopes has 
at its focal surface four 10  x 10 cm2 imaging 
micro-pattern  detectors  with  sixteen

windows  of  approximately  25  cm2  each.    A

2.1. Imaging micro-well detectors 

The  micro-pattern  detectors  are  imaging 
micro-well  detectors.    The  basic  detector 
geometry,  shown  in  Figure  2,  is  like  that  of 
the micro-CAT4,5 or WELL6.   The detector is 
an  array  of  charge-amplifying  cells  placed 
below  a  drift  electrode,  which  also  usually 
serves  as  a  detector  window.  The  sensitive 
volume  is  a  gas-filled  region  between  a  drift 
electrode  above  the  cathode  and  the  micro-
well. 

Each cell of a micro-well detector consists 
of a charge-amplifying micro-well.  The well 
itself  is  a  cylindrical  cavity  formed  in  a 
polymeric  substrate.    The  cathode  is  a  metal 
annulus around the opening of the well while 
the anode is a metal pad covering the bottom 
of the well. 

Primary  ionization  electrons  created  by 
X-ray interaction in the sensitive volume drift 
toward  the  micro-well  and  are  swept  into  the 
wells  toward  the  anode.    In  the  well,  the 
electric  fields  are  strong  enough  to  create  an 
ionization  avalanche.    Electrons  from  the 
avalanche are collected at the anode, while an 
equal,  but  opposite,  charge  appears  on  the 
cathode.

The  anodes  efficiently  collect  the  ionization 
electrons. 
  Equal  but  opposite  charges  are 
generated on the anodes and cathodes.

The baseline detectors for Lobster-ISS are 
micro-wells with rows and columns on a 400 
micron  spacing,  made  on  a  125  micron 
polyimide  substrate.    Such  detectors  have 
demonstrated stable operation at gas gains up 
to  3  x  104,  20%  energy  resolution  at  6  keV, 
and 85 micron (σ) position resolution7.  

and 

sample-and-hold 

The  system  is  based  on  a  commercial  ASIC 
(the TA1) that is a self-triggered, 128-channel 
preamplifier-shaper  with 
charge-sensitive 
simultaneous 
a 
multiplexed  analog  output.    The  TA1  has  a 
shaping  time  of  about  two  µsec  and  a 
minimum  readout  time  of  12.8 µsec.  The 
MPE  system  also  refers  the  ASIC  ground  to 
the  electrode  bias  potential,  thus  eliminating 
the need for high-voltage coupling capacitors.  
Analogue  data  and  control  signals  are 
transmitted through optocouplers. 

With  a  power  consumption  of  about  0.5 
mW/channel,  the  ASIC  has  a  dynamic  range 
of  about  1.4  x  105  electrons  and  can  be 
configured to accept signals of either polarity.  
At a shaping time of 2 microseconds, the rms 
baseline  noise  is  165  electrons  with  a  noise 
slope  of  7  electrons/pF.    With  a  micro-well 
strip capacitance of about 6 pf, the rms noise 
is such that the detectors can be operated at a 
modest gain of ~103, far below the maximum 
stable gain of ~3x104, and remain linear up to 
the  maximum  of  the  Lobster  bandpass  (3.0 
keV). 

Each  10  x  10  cm2  detector  then  has  four 
ASICs, two for anodes and two for cathodes.  
There  are  then  96  ASICs  for  the  entire 
instrument with a total power consumption of 
6W for the front-end electronics.

The detector readout electronics are based 
on  a  system  developed  for  double-sided 
silicon  strip  detectors  at  the  Max-Planck-
Institut  fur  Extraterrestrische  Physik  (MPE)8.

pitch. 

2.3. Thin detector window  

Large-area thin windows are an important 
aspect  of  the  Lobster-ISS  detectors.  The 
baseline  detector  windows  are  one-micron 
thick  polyimide  films,  coated  with  Al/AlN. 
The  estimated  leak  rate  for  such  windows  is 
~7  x  10-6  cm3  cm-2  s-1,  and  an  auxiliary  gas 
reservoir  will  supply  sufficient  gas  for  a  3-
year  period  of  operation.

provide  40%  higher  transmission  below  1.8 
keV.

Abstract:  We  investigate  nonlinear  transmission  in  a  layered  structure  consisting  of  a 

slab of positive index material (PIM) with Kerr-type nonlinearity and a sub-wavelength 

layer  of  linear  negative  index  material  (NIM)  sandwiched  between  semi-infinite  linear 

dielectrics.  We find that a thin layer of NIM leads to significant changes in the hysteresis 

width  when  the  nonlinear  slab  is  illuminated  at  an  angle  near  that  of  total  internal 

reflection.    Unidirectional  diode-like  transmission  with  enhanced  operational  range  is 

demonstrated.  These results may be useful for NIMs characterization and for designing 

novel NIMs based devices.

Recent  experimental  demonstrations  of  negative  refractive  index  materials 

(NIMs) at optical frequencies [1-4] open a fundamentally new branch of modern optics 

and  photonics  and  new  possibilities  for  manipulating  light  waves.    One  of  the  most 

typical manifestations of negative refractive index is opposite directionality of the wave 

vector and the Poynting vector.    As a result, many linear and nonlinear optical effects in 

NIMs  differ  from  those  in  regular,  positive  index  materials  (PIMs)  often  in  a  very 

unusual way.  Perhaps the two most striking effects are a reversed Snell’s law in which a 

refracted light beam bends in the direction opposite to that in regular materials [5] and a 

“superlens”  effect  in  which  a  plane-parallel  slab  of  metamaterial  can  focus  not  only 

propagating waves as a regular lens does, but also the evanescent components [6].  Most 

of the theoretical studies of linear and nonlinear optical effects in NIMs to date focused 

on  bulk  NIM  structures  or  periodic  stacks  of  NIM  and  PIM  layers  [7-14].      However, 

currently these materials are only available in the form of a single very thin film with a 

thickness  of  about  150nm  [1,2].    Obviously,  effects  like  negative  refraction  or 

superlensing  cannot  be  observed  in  such  a  thin  film.    The  negative  refraction  property 

reveals itself in a phase shift (phase advance) that was measured interferometrically in the 

experiments reported in Refs. [1,2].  

 In  this  paper  we  investigate  the  effect  of  a  very  thin  layer  of  NIM  on  the 

transmission  properties  of  a  bilayer  consisting  of  a  thin  layer  of  NIMs  and  a  nonlinear 

slab.    We  propose  to  utilize  the  phenomenon  of  optical  bistability  for  NIMs 

characterization and novel device applications.   

Most  generally,  optical  bistability  is  a  class  of  optical  phenomena  in  which  a 

system  can  exhibit  two  steady  transmission  states  for  the  same  input  intensity  [15].  

 

2 

Optical  bistability  has  been  predicted  and  experimentally  realized  in  a  various  settings 

including a Fabry-Perot resonator filled with a nonlinear material [16], layered periodic 

structures  [17]  and  a  nonlinear  slab  [18-23].    A  nonlinear  film  surrounded  by  a  linear 

dielectric  with  high  refractive  index  is  known  to  exhibit  bistability  and  more  generally 

multistability when illuminated at an angle 

θ , such that

the incident angle corresponding to the resonant peak nearest to the angle of total internal 

reflection  (TIR) 

θ   in  the  linear  transmission  curve  [20].    In  this  configuration, 

TIR

transmission in the linear regime is low.  However, as the incident intensity increases, in 

the  case  of  self-focusing  Kerr  nonlinearity,  the  nonlinear  refractive  index  increases 

resulting  in  a  shift  of  both 

θ   and 

TIR

res

θ   to  larger  values.    Simultaneously,  the 

transmission  coefficient  becomes  multi-valued  function  of  the  input  flux,  leading  to  a 

bistable behavior.   

The structure under consideration consists of a semi-infinite linear cladding (cl1), 

nonlinear optically thick layer – layer 1 (NL), linear NIM thin film – layer 2 (NIM), and a 

semi-infinite  linear  cladding  (cl2)  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.    We  demonstrate  that  (i)  an 

optically  thin  layer  of  NIM  significantly  modifies  the  bistable  nonlinear  transmission 

characteristics of this simple layered structure, and (ii) when the structure shown in Fig. 1 

is  illuminated  leftwards  versus  rightwards,  unidirectional  transmission  with  increased 

operational range can be achieved.   

The nonlinear layer is characterized by a dielectric permittivity

.    In  the  simple  case  of 

absorptionless  media  with  Kerr  nonlinearity,  Eq.  (3)  has  a  well-known  analytical 

solution.  In the most general case, both the NIM layer and the nonlinear layer are lossy 

and  the  nonlinearity  is  not  necessarily  of  pure  Kerr  type.  Therefore,  Eq.  (3)  has  to  be 

solved numerically.  We use a numerical approach described in detail in Ref. [19].  In this

, is shown in Fig. 2(b).  Figure 2(a) shows that in the presence of the 

NIM  (PIM)  thin  film, transmission maxima in  the  linear  transmission  spectrum  shift  to 

smaller(larger)  angles  with  respect  to  the  case  of  a  single  nonlinear  layer.    In  general, 

transmission  resonances  are  also  affected  by  Fresnel  reflections  at  the  boundaries, 

however  the  choice  of  parameters  in  Fig.  2  guarantees  perfect  impedance  match  at  the 

boundary between the nonlinear slab and the NIM(PIM) layer.  The layered structure in 

Fig. 1 can be viewed as an analog of a resonator filled with intensity dependent material.  

In 

the 

linear  regime, 

introduction  of 

the  NIM(PIM) 

layer 

is  equivalent 

to 

decreasing(increasing) the length of the “resonator” ultimately leading to the transmission 

 

5 

spectrum  shift  shown  in  Fig.  2.    In  the  nonlinear  regime,  this  analogy  is  valid  if  the 

thickness of the NIM(PIM) layer is small, so that an additional nonlinear phase shift that 

would be accumulated in the equivalent length of the resonator is negligible.  Recall that 

we  consider  nonlinear  transmission  at  incident  angle  near  the  TIR  angle.    As  incident 

intensity continuously increases, the refractive index of the nonlinear slab also increases.  

Once  the  bistability  threshold  or  switch-on  point  (“resonant  condition”)  is  reached,  the 

output  intensity  switches  from  a  low-transmission  state  to  a high-transmission  state.    If 

the  incident  intensity  is  now  slowly  decreased,  the  system  remains  in  the  high-

transmission state until the switch-off intensity is reached at which the system switches 

back to the low-transmission state.  The input-output characteristic for such system forms 

a hysteresis loop.   A linear NIM(PIM) thin film placed between the nonlinear slab and 

the  second  cladding  (cl2)  introduces  an  additional  phase  shift  that  affects  the  resonant 

condition. It is noteworthy that although the NIM(PIM) film is very thin, the effect of this 

phase shift on the nonlinear optical response of the entire structure turns out to be very 

significant.  As discussed above, negative refraction reveals itself in a phase advance or a 

negative  phase  shift  [1].    Therefore,  in  the  case  of  a  NIM  thin  layer,  the  “resonator” 

length  decreases  by 

2d ,  implying  that  the  intensity  dependent  nonlinear  index  change 

required  for  switching  the  transmission  to  the  high-transmission  state  should  increase. 

Therefore, we predict that the bistability threshold should increase in the case of the NIM, 

while the opposite effect should occur in the case of the PIM.  Numerical results shown 

in Fig. 2(b) confirm this prediction. 

Next, we study the effects of the NIM film parameters on the hysteresis curve and 

compare  the  results  to  those  for  the  PIM  case.    Figure  3(a)  shows  the  transmission

.    The  hysteresis  width  increases  in  the  case  of  NIM  film,  as  the 

absolute  value  of

  increases.    In  the  PIM  case,  hysteresis  width  decreases  and 

μ

bistability almost disappears for

,5.4

. The bistability threshold increases as 

well in the NIM case, in agreement with the predictions of the simple resonator analogy 

based  model  discussed  above.    We  find  that  the  effect  of  the  NIM  thin  film  is  less 

pronounced when the magnetic permeability is fixed, while the dielectric permittivity is 

varying (not shown here).  We attribute the difference between the effect of 

ε  and 

L

μ

L

to the fact that it is the magnetic permeability that affects the boundary conditions for TE 

wave.    We  expect  that  the  effect  of  varying  dielectric  permittivity  will  be  greatly 

enhanced  for  the  TM  wave  as,  in that  case  the  boundary  conditions  are  affected  by  the 

dielectric  permittivity.    Finally,  we  investigate  the  effect  of  varying  both 

ε   and 

L

while the refractive index is fixed at 

5.1−=n

 shown in Fig. 3(c) and at 

5.1=n

 in Fig. 

3(d).    Again,  we  find  that  the  hysteresis  curves’  widths  and  switch-on  points  are 

significantly increased in the case of NIM while an opposite effect observed in the case 

of PIM.   

Up to this point we assumed that the light always impinges the structure in Fig. 1 

from the left.  In what follows, we examine reciprocity in bilayer structure comprising a 

NIM film.  Previously, it has been shown that bilayers comprised of two PIM materials, 

one  of  which  possesses  an  intensity-dependent  refractive  index,  exhibit  bistability  with 

spatially  nonreciprocal  character.    For  example,  such  structure  is  transparent  for  light 

 

7 

incident from left to right while it is opaque for light traveling in the opposite direction 

[24].  Figure 4 shows hysteresis curves for the cases when the structure shown in Fig. 1 is 

illuminated  rightwards  versus  leftwards  for 

ε

  Solid  lines  correspond  to 

the NIM case when the structure is illuminated from left to right (1) and from right to left 

(2), dashed lines correspond to the PIM case when the structure is illuminated from left to 

right (3) and from right to left (4).  We find that the range of intensities corresponding to 

unidirectional transmission is significantly increased in the case of a bilayer comprising 

thin film of NIM. 

In  summary,  we  studied  numerically  the  nonlinear  transmission  properties  of  a 

layered structure consisting of a nonlinear slab and a thin layer of NIM.  We found that 

even  a  very  thin  (subwavelength)  film  of  NIM  significantly  modifies  the  nonlinear 

response of this structure.  Owing to a very high sensitivity of the width and depth of the 

hysteresis to the changes of the material parameters of the NIM layer, optical bistability 

phenomena in these structures may be utilized for NIM characterization.  In addition, we 

examined  the  nonlinear  optical  response  as  a  function  of  directionality  of  the  incident 

light  and  found  a  significantly  increased  (compared  to  the  PIM  case)  range  of  input 

intensities corresponding to the unidirectional transmission.  These results may be useful 

for  characterization  of  NIMs  as  well  as  for  novel  device  applications  such  as  optical 

memory and optical diode.

ABSTRACT 

Presented here is the mathematical model describing the phenomenon of shock 

waves. The underlying concept is based on the time-space model of wave propagation. 

Keywords: Shock Waves, Wave Equation

1. 

Concept behind the Phenomenon 
 

The first assertion is that a wave is caused by the difference between energy’s 

value at some point and “average”  energy’s values (coined as an energy’s level) in the 

“neighborhood”  of this point. That difference is called energy’s discrepancy at this point, 

which is wavily propagated both in space and in time. Besides that a wave travels with a 

finite speed (see [1]). 

The second assertion is that additionally to wavy propagation the energy’s 

discrepancy spreads directly as well. But direct spreading decelerates quickly whereas 

wave may propagate on a big distance. 

The conclusion is that when speed of direct spreading of energy’s discrepancy 

exceeds the speed of wave propagation, the wave acquires an additional energy while 

travels in space. And we have to apply the wave’s attenuation as well. 

Therefore an accumulation of energy’s discrepancy by traveling waves creates the 

phenomenon, which received a name of shock waves. 

2.  Model Description 

 

Here I describe the one-dimensional case. 

I assume that at time 

t =  in point

x =

 we have a positive energy’s 

discrepancy,

According to [1], this discrepancy propagates wavily in space with a finite speed

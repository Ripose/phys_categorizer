Abstract 

Further  progress  in  building  high-granular  large-scale  systems  based  on  Scintillation  Tiles  with 

MRS APD light readout (START) became possible thanks to the creation of an improved version 

of  MRS  APD.  The  cost  of  the  system  may  now  be  significantly  reduced  by  using  inexpensive 

extruded  scintillator.  More  than  160  START  samples  were  assembled  based  on  this  design 

modification and proved to possess 100% MIP detection efficiency and the intrinsic noise rate of 

less than 0.08 Hz. Long-term stability of START characteristics was confirmed after 3.5 months of 

operation.

Introduction 

Avalanche photo-diode, represented by a matrix of metal-resistor-semiconductor micro-cells and 

operated  in  the  Geiger  mode,  has  long  since  become  an  attractive  device  in  high-energy  physics 

instrumentation. MRS APD [1], a successful realization of this technique, has been under development

at  the  Center  of  Perspective  Technologies  and  Apparatus  (CPTA)  since  the  early  1990’s.  The  first 

encouraging  results  on  MRS  APD,  reported  at  the  Beaune  conference  nine  years  ago  [2],  launched 

intensive  research  on  employing  this  photo-diode  for  the  light  readout  in  scintillating  tile-fiber 

systems.  Such  systems  seemed  to  have  good  prospects  in  muon  triggering,  calorimetry,  medical  and 

astrophysical  applications.  Within  the  next  several  years these efforts led to a significant increase in 

the  quantum  efficiency  of  MRS  APD  for  the  visible  light  and  to  a  reduction  of  its  photo-ionization 

coefficient [3].  

Advantages of MRS APD over traditional multi-anode photo-multiplying tubes include: 

(1)  miniature  dimensions  with  the  sensitive  area  on  the  order  of  1 mm2  (which  allows  installing 

MRS APD directly inside scintillating plastic) 

(2) 

(3) 

low and safe bias voltage of 20–50 V (depending on the photo-diode version, see Section 2) 

low power consumption with the typical supply current in the range of 1–5 µA 

(4)  no need for special housing  

(5) 

resemblance  of  main  characteristics  of  photo-diodes  produced  in  lots  (which  facilitates  the 

construction of large arrays of MRS APDs)  

(6) 

absence of cross-talks between tightly installed photo-diodes  

(7) 

insensitivity to magnetic field [4] 

(8) 

radiation hardness [5] 

(9) 

low cost 

START, a Scintillation Tile with MRS APD Light Readout [6], was initially developed for the 

purpose  of  building  a  high-granular  and  efficient  cosmic  muon  triggering  system.  Its  characteristics 

depend on the parameters of its main constituents, viz. a pair of MRS APDs, a scintillating plastic plate 

and a piece of wavelength-shifting (WLS) optical fiber embedded into the plastic. This article reports 

on  the  recent  progress  made  in  the  improvement  of  these  parameters  and  —  consequently  —  in 

START performance. Special emphasis is placed on the potential of START cost reduction, which is 

essential for mass production. 

2.  Advances in MRS APD 

The  most  recent  MRS  APD  samples,  produced  by  CPTA  at  the  end  of  2004,  have  been 

thoroughly  studied  at  ITEP.  Fig. 1  shows  a  photograph  of  the  MRS  APD  sensitive  surface  taken 

through a microscope ocular. The micro-cell structure of the photo-diode is clearly visible.

coefficients  α  of  all  examined  photo-diodes. 

The latter value is defined as the relative fall of 

the MRS APD noise counting rate with respect 

to  the  increase  of  the  discriminating  threshold 

from  the  position  of  one  of  the  photo-electron 

peaks to the next in the amplitude spectrum. In 

fact,  α  characterizes  the  level  of  optical  cross-

talks  between  neighboring  micro-cells  in  the 

photo-diode  and  —  altogether  with  QE  —  is 

crucial  for  the  choice  of  the  optimal  bias 

voltage,  individually  chosen  for  each  MRS 

APD [1,3]. The basic parameters of MRS APD 

as  well  as  the  average  measurement  results  are 

summarized  in  Table 1.  As  may  be  seen,  the 

quantum  efficiency  of  MRS  APD  for  the  wavelength  of  λ  =  560 nm  exceeds  30%,  while  the  photo-

ionization  coefficient  is  as  low  as  1/15.  For  comparison,  listed  alongside  are  the  data  obtained  with 

previous versions of MRS APD and corresponding references.

3.  START: adaptation for mass production 

Scintillation  Tile  with  MRS  APD  Light  Readout  (START)  [6]  has  proved  to  be  a  reliable  and 

efficient  tool  for  muon  triggering  [7].  Moreover,  it  remains  a  promising  instrument  for  calorimetry, 

medical and astrophysical imaging. START normally consists of a scintillating plastic plate, a piece of 
wavelength-shifting (WLS) optical fiber (typically Y111) laid in a circular groove inside the plate, two 

MRS APDs, firmly pressed to both ends of the fiber and operated in coincidence, an opaque wrapper 

and  a  front-end  card  mounted  directly  on  the  detector  [6].  Rectangular  shape  of  the  plastic  plates 

allows the coverage of unrestrictedly large areas with STARTs, the size of ‘blind’ zones being limited 

only  by  the  thickness  of  the  wrapper.  A  compact  and  low-maintenance  device,  START  represents  a 

convincing alternative to traditional scintillation counters, in which the light readout is performed by 

photo-multiplying tubes.  

A 32-channel operational muon triggering telescope was assembled of STARTs, sized 15 × 15 × 
1.5 cm3, in 2004 [7]. It was developed as a prototype of a much larger cosmic muon facility intended 

for  regular  tests  of  the  ALICE  TOF  system  components  [8].  The  construction  of  the  facility  places 

significant restrictions on the overall cost of its constituent parts, implying that the single START price 

must decrease dramatically as soon as the mass assemblage begins. This problem is partially addressed 

by  the  fact  that  the  cost  of  wafers  for  MRS  APD  is  independent  of  the  number  of  photo-diodes 

produced in one series, resulting in lower price per unit.  

The other way to reduce the cost of START is through using less expensive scintillating plastic. 
Along with the 1.5 cm-thick BC-4122 used in the 32-channel prototype [7], a much cheaper extruded 
scintillator Polisterol-1653, 1 cm thick (which is a technological limit), has been investigated. Within 

the START geometry and in conjunction with Y11 WLS fiber, the light yield of BC-412 plates is 1.7 

times  larger  than  that  of  Polisterol-165  plates.  However,  the  use  of  new  MRS  APD  with  higher 

quantum efficiency may compensate for this ratio. To verify this expectation, two STARTs, both made 

of  Polisterol-165  plates  and  equipped  with  the  previous  (2001–2003,  Refs. [1,3])  and  latest  (2004) 
versions of MRS APD, were studied with a 1.28 GeV/c π--beam at the ITEP PS. Fig. 2 compares the 

self-triggered  amplitude  spectra  obtained  in  each  case  from  one  of  the  two  MRS  APDs.  Sigma-

estimation of the number of photo-electrons [2] shows that the scintillation light collected over 15 × 15 
×  1 cm3  Polisterol-165  plate  produces  on  average  16  photo-electrons  in  the  modern  version  of  MRS 

APD (Fig. 2b). This is an excellent result when compared to 11 photo-electrons produced in the older

version  of  the  photo-diode  (Fig. 2a).  Setting  the 

discriminating  threshold  at  the  value  corresponding 

to 3.5 photo-electrons, results in 100% MIP detection 

efficiency  by  START  equipped  with  modern  MRS 

APDs. The noise rate in this case has been found to 

be less than 0.05 Hz. 

4.  START:  long  term  stability  and 

improved performance  

Sixteen  STARTs  with  the  best  performance 

were selected from the components of the 32-channel 

cosmic muon system prototype [7] and installed into 

the ALICE/LHC TOF test facility [8] as shown in the 

photograph  in  Fig. 3.  Two  strips  of  eight  STARTs, 

intended  to  pick  up  cosmic  muons,  were  positioned 

one over another on the opposite sides of the ALICE 

TOF  module  put  under  tests.  After  3.5  months  of 

continuous  operation  all  the  16  STARTs  were 

examined.  No  performance  deterioration  has  been 

found  and  the  MIP  detection  efficiency  of  all  cells 

remained above 99%.

system  prototype  [7]  was  found  to  be  larger  than 

expected. This effect may be attributed to the low coupling quality of the fibers to the photo-diodes, 

which might exist in those detectors. The dimensions and shape of the sensitive area of the new MRS 

APD  were  adjusted  to  allow  a  better  coupling  to  the  WLS  fiber  edge,  resulting  in  more  efficient 

scintillation  light  collection  and  consequently  in  a  smaller  spread  of  the  number  of  photo-electrons, 

which has been already observed with new STARTs. 

More than 160 new START samples were assembled and tested at ITEP and CERN in March-

July  2005  in  the  framework  of  the  ALICE/LHC  TOF  project.  All  of  them  were  made  of  15  ×  15  × 
1 cm3  Polisterol-165  plates  and  equipped  with  the  modern  version  of  MRS  APD.  The  assembled 

detectors proved to possess MIP detection efficiency of more than 99% and intrinsic noise of less than 

0.08 Hz, which corresponds to less than 5% background level in the cosmic muon triggering rate.

5.  Conclusion 

Recent achievements in MRS APD development have granted additional advantages to START 

in terms of its implementation in high-granular, low-noise and efficient muon triggering systems. Cost 

reduction  prospects  for  such  systems  are  now  real  due  to  the  possibility  of  using  less  expensive 

extruded scintillator. The reliability of START has been proven in multiple tests and is supported by 

the  evidence  of  its  long-term  stable  operation.  Construction  of  many  START  samples  is 

technologically simple and has become an established process.

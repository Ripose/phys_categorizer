Abstract

We pursue research leading towards the nature of causality in the universe. We establish the
equation of the universe’s evolution from the universe-state function and its series expansion,
in which causes and eﬀects connect together to construct a linked chain of causality. And the
equation of causality [1] is rederived. Therefrom, our theory informs the progress of the universe
and, simulaneously, a law that presents everywhere. Furthermore, we lay some foundations for
a new mathematical phrasing of the movement of physics. That is the life-like mathematics - a
mathematics full of life.

1 INTRODUCTION

To pursue the idea of the previous article [1] a question arises that if the law of causality is the most
general law, then about what will it inform us in the whole of the universe, in the birth, expansion
and conclusion of the universe, as well as in some concrete phenomenon and process in the universe?

The transformation chain “Diﬀerence → Contradiction → Solving of contradiction” is also the
expansion chain of the universe. The expansion chain of the universe starts from the absolute inﬁnite
and homogeneous space. In the absolute space there is a Nothing, but itself is the one, is the unique:

the content is zero, the form is one. Thus as acting negatively all the absolute space acts negatively
just its unique existence. Therefrom the immanent contradiction of this state of the universe is

inﬁnitely great, and the universe self-solves by expanding into inﬁnite series of smaller contradictions
and solving them. The consequence is that our world was born.

In order to describe quantitatively all processes of the birth, expansion and conclusion of the

universe, we establish a universal equation from the universe-state function in Sec. 2. And the
In
equation of causality is anew devised exactly in Sec. 3. Our conclusion is given in Sec. 4.

Appendices A and B we present a few foundations for functor and life-like mathematics.

2 UNIVERSAL EQUATION

1! At the debut of each expansion of the universe, the f! function characterizing for the early state
of the universe is equal gradually to zero everywhere and forming the absolute vacuum-state function
f!( ).

f! = f!( ).

f!( ) = f!(K),

Continuously, in this expansion, the vacuum state of the universe becomes the absolute space
state but still is always equal to zero everywhere, because in the vacuum of the universe there

contain inﬁnitely many absolute spaces

where f!(K) is called absolute space-state function of the set of absolute spaces in the universe’s
vacuum, with K being absolute space set K = {...k...}.

Therefore, the absolute space-state function satisﬁes the following condition

f!(K) = 0,

∀k ∈ K

(cid:26)

f!(K)dk = 1,

R

(1.1)

CAUSALITY: The Nature of Everything – N. T. Anh

where the notation “0” is the “nothing” in the universe’s vacuum, and “1” symbolizes the unique
existence of the universe’s vacuum.

f!(K) is equal to zero everywhere, but its integral with respect to space is unique, or the whole of
f!(K) over space is unique. (Right in whole integral region, f!(K) still is equal to zero - The absolute
vacuum has nothing, but has uniquely that “nothing”.)

f!(K) is limitless and homogeneous everywhere, is determined in every neighborhood of point
spaces κi in a set of absolute point spaces K(κi ∈ K = {...κ...}), is continuous with ki = κi, and
exists the limit limki→κi f!(K) = f!(K). f!(K) is continuously diﬀerentiable on the set of point spaces
K, in which all direct and reverse partial derivatives to all orders exist and are continuous due to the
existence of limits, respectively.

2! The state functions of the absolute vacuum as well as of the absolute space determine the
states of the homogeneous state vacuum and the homogeneous space, in which as transferring with
respect to all degrees of freedom there cannot be any arbitrary immanent diﬀerence.

But, the absolute vacuum is a unique and homogeneous state in which there is nothing. As
self-acting negatively, it leads to self-acting positively itself and vice versa. In the unique state there

contains nothing but still exists a “nothingness”! For that reason, in overall the absolute vacuum still
contains a diﬀerence: between the “nihility” and the unique state of this “nihility”. That diﬀerence
is inﬁnitely great, and therefore the immanent contradiction of this state is also inﬁnitely great. It

is easy to be identiﬁed this contradiction in the relation (1.1).

So the self-solving is performed by expanding f!(K) into series in the whole of space,

where the factors a are degree-of-freedom transfer coeﬃcients.

Therefrom, we have the following equation, from Eq. (1.5),

This equation is named universal equation, where each element is of the form

(1.10)

(1.11)

The two spaces ki and κi in the respective sets K and K are diﬀerent from each other, but the
κi space lies in the ki space. Id est, these two spaces diﬀer mutually but they concern directly with
each other through limiting of integral sum, so they annihilate mutually generating the contradiction
between them

where “−” is signed annihilation operation between two spaces ki and κi. The dimension of contra-
diction depends on the dimension of spaces ki and κi which contribute to create that contradiction.

Thus, (1.9) means that A(0)(k)

κ at the point space κ of the set K is just the contradiction
(cid:12)
[k − κ] = M between the absolute space k of the set K and the point space κ of the set K contained
(cid:12)
in K. For the reason that A(0)(k)
κ reﬂects right the contradiction between the κ space for which
(cid:12)
this function characterizes and the k space, characterized by A(k) that is rather conservative than
(cid:12)
A(k)|κ (in immanent contradiction).

Hence, partial derivatives of A(k)|κ to all orders with respect to all possible quantities in point
spaces κi of the set K are just partial derivatives of the contradiction M to all orders with respect to
all possible degrees of freedom in spaces (i.e. with respect to degrees of transfer of contradiction), with

f!(M)|M=0 = M′,

f!(M) = M′M.

A(M) = eΣaM

M M.
c

[ki − κi] = Mi,

CAUSALITY: The Nature of Everything – N. T. Anh

a being the degree-of-freedom transfer coeﬃcients. And then, the derivatives M′ of contradiction
with respect to contradiction-transfer facilities become the expedients for solving of contradiction

M.

c

In M, the unit elements in the main diagonal form a reﬂecting mirror demarcating the two
worlds. When an element is generated in one world, a some element in the other is simultaneously

annihilated, and conversely. (they are conserved of degree). The two reﬂecting worlds seem to be
alike but if an arbitrary element of the one unites some arbitrary element of the other, they both
will annihilate mutually to zero, Eq. (1.6). The annihilation to zero from two some elements of the

two reﬂecting worlds is to satisfy the condition (1.3).

Each element of one world will become a some element of the other only after it has passed the

reﬂecting mirror, the reﬂecting mirror has annihilated all natures of old world in this element so that
it can receive new natures when it enter into a new world.

5! Let us now generalize all above concepts. If the universe comprises a set of actions, thereat
we can regard that K is set of actions which exist in all absolute spaces and K is the set of actions
which exist in all point spaces. f!( ) is the state function of the zero action, f!(K) is the action
function of absolute spaces, and f!(K)|K is the action function of point spaces. They satisfy the
condition (1.1), with “0” being “zero action”, and “1” being the action of its unique existence.

A some contradiction, thereat, will be deﬁned as the simultaneous coexistence of two mutual

annihilation actions,

and satisﬁes Eq. (1.6).

Mi = [ki − κi],

ki ∈ K and κi ∈ K,

From the condition of the uniqueness of the zero action, we obtain the universal equation (1.11)
where M′ contains elements as derivatives of contradictions with respect to all possible degrees
of freedom. On the other hand, they act onto contradictions making contradictions to vary with
respect to some degrees of freedom – i.e. making contradictions to be solved over some facilities for

transfer of contradiction, so derivatives of contradictions with respect to all degrees of freedom are
just contradiction-solving expedients over all contradiction-transfer facilities.

The universal equation manifests the birth, evolution and conclusion of the universe, beginning

from the absolute vacuum and then its expanding out the whole of the universe to inﬁnitely many
repeat period chains. The universal equation expresses just solving an inﬁnitely great immanent

contradiction of the absolute vacuum state by dividing into inﬁnitely many small contradictions to
solve them.

CAUSALITY: The Nature of Everything – N. T. Anh

In the absolute vacuum there are inﬁnitely many point spaces, solving contradictions between
the vacuum and point spaces makes point spaces concentrate and crystallized together (accretion)

forming early matters. They combine together, and continuous so, gradually forming the world in a
unity entity of the nature.

If speaking in the geometrical language, contradictions between the zero curvature of the absolute

vacuum (or of a sphere with an inﬁnitely large radius) and inﬁnitely high curvatures of point spaces (or
of spheres with inﬁnitely small radii) must vary to reach states with lowest immanent contradictions,
i.e. curvatures must vary to reach and conclude some curvatures (following tendency). The curvature

of the absolute vacuum continuously conserves and is equal to zero, so these contradictions always are
solved with respect to the tendency of decreasing curvatures of point spaces to zero (i.e. increasing

their radii to inﬁnity) so as to coincide with the curvature of the absolute vacuum. As curvatures of
point spaces decrease just as point spaces concentrate and crystallize together to form new spaces

with lower curvatures (i.e. with larger radii).

Concreting that at each point in the absolute vacuum there is an appearance of inﬁnitely many
Isophasic ﬂows force to appear an impulse at this point, immediately,

centripetal ﬂows (inﬂow).

that impulse causes an immanent contradiction and the contradiction is solved directly by emitting
backward ﬂows (outﬂow) to decrease strength of inward ﬂows. Then after that, emitter is weak

gradually and a new cycle will begin, etc.

In the absolute vacuum such inﬁnitely many point spaces create a global motion of the universe
generating inﬁnitely many thermal currents everywhere in the universe. The universe becomes full of

life. Motion of inﬁnitely many point spaces leads to the formation of groups separated by isophasic
current points. (Maybe the opposite phase groups would create the positive and negative extrema

or mutually symmetrical extrema. And points which have intermediary phases would disperse to
form diﬀerent groups then move gradually to one of extrema). Each group creates one proper wave
of ﬂows giving rise to the universe to “breathe” lively.

In the universal equation, the sign “=” has the meaning that: at the debut of each expansion pro-
cess, the equation performs generally in the forward direction (rightwards), after that the equation
is in relative equilibrium when there are new contradictions generated and there also are contra-

dictions solved, ﬁnally the equation performs generally in the backward direction (leftwards) when
contradictions are solved more and more – at that time the expansion series converges uniformly to
f!(K) = f!( ) = f!.

Each numerical value under contradictions is determined by reﬂecting them onto the quantity 0!
of the absolute vacuum, and as contradictions vary the numerical values also alter after. The state

function thus expands into chains in the reversible process, contradictions are generated gradually,

CAUSALITY: The Nature of Everything – N. T. Anh

10

and quantities also gradually appear more and more. In element equations, when expanding sums
there will be chains of terms, each chain is a period, later chain is in higher development degree than

sooner chain.

In a few real concrete cases, the expansion of the equation requires strictly to determine superior
limits of sums – i.e. to obey the rule of ﬁlling “reservoirs” of the universe. If the equation expands

from small contradictions to great contradictions, then when a some contradiction which corresponds
with a superior limit index of a sum is greater than other contradiction which corresponds with an
inferior limit index of a successive sum, the smaller contradiction will be expanded foremost. This

is similar to the expansion with respect to levels of energy minimization of elements in the periodic
system.

Thus, all phenomena in the universe seem to proceed in an accomplished order and the whole
universe continuously obeys a law. A some term of series does not really open out yet but it has
denoted a progress orientation of future expansion.

About application, above all the universal equation is used for deriving directly the equation of
causality, after that for building equations of many quantity sets in each scope of a researched space
and for researching constructions and systems of worlds in the universe.

3 EQUATION OF CAUSALITY

We now research the reciprocal reﬂection from the space world or the world of actions to the time
world. The time world stands of a fundamental background or ﬁeld, onto which other worlds all

reﬂect as a whole. Therefore the time world is relatively independent, and other worlds seem to be
timeworld-dependent. In the time world the process of variation and transformation also is performed
and formed from the functions f! and f!( ) and expanded into series, ﬁnally reaches the homogeneous
state and closes a reﬂection period.

As the world of actions reﬂects on the time world, the set of actions K is dependent on the set
of times T = {...⊤...} which exist in absolute spaces, and K is dependent on T = {...τ...} in point
spaces. Thereby, f!( ) reﬂects on time forming the zero-action function of the absolute vacuum in
the non-time state, f!(K) becomes the function f!(K(T )); and f!(K)|K grows f!(K(T ))

.

Similarly, in the time world the function f!(K(T )) also is expanded into series by linear transfor-

mation from the time T to T ,

Therefore, all-order partial derivatives of the function A(0)(k(⊤))

with respect to all times in

point spaces are also just all-order partial derivatives of contradiction with respect to all times, with
coeﬃcients (−) generated by reﬂecting from the world of actions to the time world. Therefrom, the

Consider an arbitrary contradiction in M, we obtain

From this equation, we identify that a is not only to be a degree-of-freedom transfer coeﬃcient
but also to be a world transfer coeﬃcient. In this case it is from the space world to the time world.

Supposing that (M ′M) reﬂects from the space world to the time world,

(M ′M)k ∼ (M ′M)t.

M ′M ∼ −

M ∆t.

If considering ∆t as a non-variable contradiction or a varied but invariable contradiction, then as

(M ′M)t = −

M ∆t, the equation aM ′M = −

M ∆t is evident due to the result of reﬂection

And therefore a are generated to transfer worlds.

When taking ∆t into a then we will obtain the equation of causality,

(2.9)

In the case the contradiction is characterized by itself, namely M = M(M ), then

where M0 is the contradiction at the time t = t0.

M = M0e−a(t−t0),

We next consider a case that if ∆t = [⊤ − τ ] = 0 – i.e. ⊤ = τ , the time in the universe is identical
in all spaces – thereat the time includes homogeneousness:
it has an identical value everywhere at
an arbitrary point time of the universe, in the universe there is no deﬂection of time at one place

and other, at one space and other.

According to this signiﬁcance, the time is a relatively independent world, so whenever there is
a time deﬂection then this deﬂection will must be solved to reach a lowest possible deﬂection – i.e.
following the tendency ∆t = [⊤ − τ ] → 0.

The time world stands of a background or a ﬁeld, in which everything, every system, every
phenomenon and every state, etc. all reﬂect, and through which to “know” diﬀerences in their

motive process, to “know” diﬀerences between them and others and to ﬁnd ways and tendencies for
solving.

Thus, if ∆t = [⊤ − τ ] = 0, in the time world there is no contradiction, then Υ will be equal to

the unit I. Therefrom,

And after soaking the universal equation into it,

f!(M(Υ)) =

M I.

(2.10)

We have answered almost very diﬃcult and mysterious questions of the universe. Why do everything,

every phenomenon, every system, every state, every process and so on all perform and exhibit as what
we know but not perform and exhibit otherwise? Because, in very deep of things, phenomena and

processes there are diﬀerent elements to annihilate mutually appearing contradictions between them.
Elements annihilate mutually leading gradually to do not annihilate any more. This requirement
makes them appear expedients for solving of contradiction and facilities for transfer of contradiction

in the tendency of decreasing gradually contradictions between mutual annihilation elements. And
owing to variation of these contradictions as well as of diﬀerent elements in things, phenomena and

processes, in the universe there is an appearance of laws, in which everything, phenomenon, process
and so on all perform and exhibit just as that we see in the nature, and anywhere in the universe.

Then, why do only diﬀerent elements play an important role for performance and exhibition of
everything, phenomenon and process but do not any other elements? Because the diﬀerence is the
ﬁrst axiom of the universe. If there were no existence of diﬀerence, then in the universe everywhere

all would be identical, and therefore none of anything would exist. For that reason, only diﬀerent
elements are the ﬁrst elements and play an important role for exhibition and variation of things,

phenomena and processes in the universe. If so, then how is the universe in variation and in motion?

Variation processes in the universe could not arise from condensed matter and then create a
big-bang generating particles, material bodies, etc. and making the universe expand... Because the

outset state of the universe must be a state without immanent diﬀerence, or more exactly, with a least
quantity of immanent diﬀerences. If matter were condensed, then it would comprise inﬁnitely many

diﬀerent elements, therefore condensed state is impossible to be the basic state. And if condensed
matter is identical, then in the universe there will not be the existence of a big-bang but matter will

CAUSALITY: The Nature of Everything – N. T. Anh

must be varied in the expansion phase of the universal equation. In reality, in the early universe
inﬁnitely many point spaces create inﬁnitely many “big-bangs” which do not explode out but burst

into center of each point.

Therefore, the universe varies and transforms in the process

f! → f!( ) = 0 → f!(K) → ∞ → (1) → f!.

In the debut, f! is equal gradually to zero everywhere forming itself and f!( ), thereby the time
world also is gradually formed and contributes to crystallize the space world. The process from f!
to inﬁnity is performed as in the universal equation. After that, because every contradiction solved

all reach a state without diﬀerence – i.e. everywhere, everything are all identical, and ﬁnally lead
to a homogeneous state. At that time the process from inﬁnity to (1) is performed. The end is the
process of f!-zing everywhere, closing a motion period.

Brieﬂy, the whole universe is a unity entity in causal connections, all phenomena seem to progress
on intrinsic order following the universal equation and the whole universe continually obeys a law –

the law of causality. From observations in the microcosm as well as in the macrocosm science always
discovers deterministic “disorders” of the universe which are controlled by a some “intelligence” –

due to contradiction.

Brieﬂy, an arbitrary function can expand into the Taylor convergent series then also can be

written as a functor and it satisﬁes the equation of causality. In reality, every function can expand
into the Taylor series if we recognize the existence of all zero-valued, ﬁnite-valued and inﬁnite-valued
derivatives. At that time, in the series there is no remainder and the series has inﬁnite order number.

Thus, every phenomenon can be described in the form of functor, and variation and motion (i.e.
every process) of phenomena then can be expressed in the equation of causality.

B. Life-like Mathematics

The life-like mathematics is a new mathematical phrasing, in which objects and quantities, etc.

always are in motion. The life-like mathematics describes relationships of equation-of-causality plu-
rality and “living” of the universal equation, etc. Therewithal, the life-like mathematics comprises
not only pictures of the nature but also abstract quantities with copious proper lifetimes reﬂecting

mutually in a uniﬁed common lifetime.

In the space of actions K there exists a set of free actions

K = {K1, K2, ..., Kn, ...}.

a.

If actions have not any common thing and they are alike, then they are independent mutually

K1, K2, ..., Kn, ... ≡ K1, K2, ..., Kn, ...

b.

If actions have one element or many common elements, alike elements between them, then they
connect mutually by annihilation operations “−”. If those actions are diﬀerent from each other,

then they annihilate mutually generating contradictions:

a. As the two spaces of actions K1 and K2 sink into each other: each action in one space of actions
searches and selects actions among appropriate actions in other space in order to unite mutu-

ally when between them there are common elements (if not, they have mutually independent
tendency) and then forming contradictions in a new space M:

|K1 − K2| = M.

Writing so means that it has eliminated actions which do not contribute to create contradictions.

b. As the operator space M′ sink into the space M: each some contradiction Mi in the space M
searches and selects necessary operators (e.g. M ′
i) among appropriate operators in the operator
space M′ so that those contradictions are solved with respect to transfer facilities (degrees of
freedom) which chosen operators have contained (if operators are not necessary, contradictions
will not choose them). These make the space M have contradiction parts to be solved, that

solving obeys the equation of causality and contradictions decrease gradually to reach a lowest
contradiction state.

Finally, the space M reaches and concludes at a new space of actions K3.

Brieﬂy, there are many more actions then many more such kinds of contradictions and derivatives

of contradictions and also the same for the equation of causality.

Depending on concrete problem, the annihilation operation may be a vectorial product, or may
be a derivative limit, etc. and the degrees of freedom may be a rotation angle, may be coordinates,
or also may be the time, etc. and similar to the world transfer coeﬃcient may be a deﬁnite value

depending upon reﬂecting from one world to other in that concrete problem.

We would like to thank Dr. D. M. Chi for useful discussions and valuable comments.

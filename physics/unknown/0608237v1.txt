Abstract 
 

This paper presents theory and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations for 

a  single  and  arrays  of  sub-wavelength  cylindrical  holes  in  metallic  films  presenting 

large  transmission.  These  calculations  are  in  excellent  agreement  with  experimental 

measurements. This effect has to be understood in terms of the properties exhibited by 

the dielectric constant of metals which cannot be treated as ideal metals for the purpose 

of  transmission  and  diffraction  of  light.  We  discuss  the  cases  of  well-differentiated 

metals  silver  and  tungsten.  It  is  found  that  the  effect  of  surface  plasmons  or  other 

surface  wave  excitations  due  to  a  periodical  set  of  holes  or  other  roughness  at  the 

surface is marginal. The effect can enhance but also can depress the transmission of the 

arrays as shown by theory and experiments. The peak structure observed in experiments 

is a consequence of the interference of the wavefronts transmitted by each hole and is 

determined  by  the  surface  array  period  independently  of  the  material.  Without  large 

transmission through a single hole there is no large transmission through the array. We 

found  that  in  the  case  of  Ag  which  at  the  discussed  frequencies  is  a  metal  there  are 

cylindrical plasmons at the wall of the hole, as reported by Economu et al 30 years ago, 

that enhanced the transmission. But it turns out, as will be explained, that for the case of 

W which behaves as a dielectric, there is also a large transmission when compared with 

that of an ideal metal waveguide. To deal with this problem one has to use the measured 

dielectric  function  of  the  metals.  We  discuss  thoroughly  all  these  cases  and  compare 

with the data.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Experiments  were  reported  [1]  showing  that  the  transmission  of  light  through  sub-

wavelength holes drilled periodically in a metallic film of Ag was large, 1000´s times 

larger,  as  compared  with  the  transmission  of  one  single  hole  of  the  same  size  in  the 

same  material.  Recent  experiments  [2],  by  part  of  the  same  team  of  ref.  1(Lezec  and 

Thio),  appear  to  contradict  the  earlier  experiments  [1].    The  explanation  of  the 

experiments [1] where based on the existence of surface plasmons polaritons (SPP) that 

are excited in the case of a set of periodic holes. After the initial work, a whole serial of 

papers have appeared insisting on the same point (for a review see ref.2). The last one, 

to our knowledge, appears recently on the same matter [3]. The recent paper by Lezec 

and  Thio  [2],  reviewing  the  field  and  containing  many  new  data,  criticised  much  the 

whole  saga  of  papers  on  the  matter  of  the  extraordinary  enhancement  of  the 

transmission  in  a  periodic  array  of  holes  in  metallic  films.  This  paper  [2]  claims  to 

dismount  the  interpretation  of  SPP  to  understand  the  experiments  and  disclaims  the 

entire  picture  in  periodic  arrays  of  holes.  Also,  it  showed  experimentally  that  the 

transmission enhancement by the periodic array with respect to that of a single hole is as 

much as a factor of 7, not a factor of 1000s, so that it can be a depression of the relative 

transmission  as  well.  In  fact  the  title  of  this  paper  is:  “Diffracted  evanescent  wave 

model for enhanced and suppressed optical transmission through subwavelengths hole 

arrays”. Maybe there is a point of broken physical argument in ref. 1 and subsequent 

papers. Their claims are based on that they compared the transmission by each hole of 

the array with the transmission of a single hole reported in an earlier paper by Bethe [4]. 

This  paper  [4]  was  a  theoretical  study  showing  that  the  transmission  of  a  sub-

wavelength  hole  drilled  in  a  perfect  metal  screen,  ideal  conductor  (dielectric  constant 
being  negative  infinity,  ε→  -∞),  behaves  as  (r/λ)4,  where  λ  is  the  wavelength  of  the 

radiation  and  r  is  the  hole  radius.  However  ref.4  makes  an  approximation  that  is  only 

valid for holes much smaller than λ, so that the field is practically constant on the hole. 

This  does  not  hold  for  the  experiments  reported  [1-3]  because  for  the  frequencies 

considered,  the  hole  radius  should  be  smaller  than  25  nm  but  the  holes  used  in  the 

experiments are much larger. Another point is that an ideal metal has little resemblance 

regarding optical propagation with plasmonic metals as Ag or with a dielectric as W for 

the  experimental  frequencies.  This  has  been  discussed  in  part  in  a  recent  work  [5]. 

Therefore  the  Bethe  paper  [4]  has  no  significance  in  the  problem  at  hand.  In  fact  the 

main result in ref.2, in our opinion, is that the single whole transmission is very large 

when compared with that reported in ref.4 or with that resulting from a theory for wave 

propagation  in  ideal  metals  long  waveguides.  Therefore  it  seems  reasonable  to  try  to 

discuss and understand these experiments using the experimental frequency dependent 

dielectric constants for the metals Ag and W. For these two materials we used extensive 

comparisons with the data. 

The aim of this paper is to study the transmissions of a hole of sub-wavelength size in a 

flat  metallic  film  with  thickness  of  the  order  of  the  hole  diameter,  as  those  used 

experimentally [1-3]. When simplistic estimations are considered, the transmission can 

be of the order of several thousand times larger than that for the same hole in an ideal 

metal.  The  understanding  of  this  phenomenon  is  due  to  two  terms  for  Ag:  i)  surface 

plasmons  excited  at  the  cylinder  walls  defining  the  hole,  having  the  same  nature  that 

those described by Pfeiffer, Economou and Ngai [6] also Martinos and Economou [7] 

for metallic cylinders and recently discussed in the contest of the problem at hand [5]. 

These  are  surface  plasmons  rotating  at  the  surface  of  the  cylinders  and  propagating 

along  its  axis.  ii)  the  penetration  of  the  field  in  the  metal.  For  the  dielectric  metal  W, 

there may be a question whether cylindrical plasmons exist, but still is the penetration of 

the  field  in  the  metal.  The  signatures  of  waves  at  the  cylinder  surface  are  well 

manifested  in  the  intensity  curve  depending  of  frequency  for  single  holes.  As  will  be 

seen these are effects that are governed in a subtle way by the values of the dielectric 

 

 

function at each frequency. 

II. CALCULATIONS 

The structures we calculated in this work are single circular hole or hole arrays in a flat 

metallic film with a given diameter d and thickness t. Fig.1 a and b present a view of the 

single  and  arrays  of  hole  structures  with  period  P.  The  plane  wave  impinges 

perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  the  holes.  plane  pulse  wave  with  a  broad  band  is  set  as 

incident  wave.  We  recorded  both  the  incident  and  transmitted  wave  through  the 

structure. The frequency response of the structure is calculated by dividing the spectrum 

of the transmitted wave by the spectrum of the incident wave.  

The  calculations  are  performed  using  3D-FDTD  method.  The  wave  spectrums  before 

and after the structures are achieved by Fourier transform from the recorded wave signal 

in time domain. 

In  the  FDTD  method  we  used  for  different  materials,  the  metals  like  Ag  and  W  are 

modelled  as  frequency  dispersive  media.  The  corresponding  frequency  dependent 

permittivities are retrieved from experimental data by Johnson and Christy [8] and from 

Physics Data [9]. For ideal metal, it is treated by means that the electric components of 

wave are excluded from any part of the metal; i.e. the field is forced to be zero at the 

metal surface. This is equivalent to set the permittivity as infinitely negative.  

The  perfect  matched  layer  absorbing  boundary  condition  [10]  is  applied  in  FDTD 

calculations for single hole transmission, and periodical boundary condition are applied 

for hole arrays transmission. The grids and time steps are taken fine enough to obtain 

convergent solutions. 

II. A. The Ag Case for Single Holes 

i) Calculations  

 

 

 

Ag is a paradigmatic case for studying surface plasmons and there are a large amount of 

literatures  on  surface  polariton  plasmons  (SPP)  by  gratings  [11]  in  the  visible  region. 

The  reason  for  that  is  because  at  these  wavelengths  the  imaginary  part  of  the 

permittivity (ε2) is small, then the SPP is well defined [11, 12].  Fig.2a shows the real 

(ε1) and the imaginary (ε2) part of the permittivity. It represents a nice Drude plasmonic 

behaviour  with  a  bulk  plasmon  wavelength,  λp=325nm  (ωp~3.8ev).  It  has  been  also 

shown  that  in  a  periodic  surface  with  a  certain  small  single  Fourier  component  the 

enhancement  of  the  field  due  to  the  SPP  can  be  very  large  (≈  100  times  that  of  the 

incident field) [12,13]. However when the Fourier component increases or many Fourier 

component  exist  (for  example  a  step-like  profile  of  the  surface)  the  enhancement  is 

reduced  drastically  due  to  the  enlargement  of  the  SPP  linewidth.  We  mention  these 

points to stress that the existence of SPP in a surface does not imply large enhancements 

but many other requisites are needed. In particular the structure for study in Fig.1b has 

many Fourier components and the SPP enhancement due to SPP can not be large.  

To  model  metal  Ag  in  the  calculation,  a  Drude  dispersion  relation  (Equ.  1)  is  used  to 

meet the frequency dependent permittivity of Ag.

which  is  characterized  by  fitting  permittivity  εf  in  the  visible  range,  the  bulk  plasma 

frequency  ωp  and  the  damping  constant  δ.  These  parameters  are  chosen  to  fit  the 

experimental data by Johnson and Christy [8] for Ag. The chosen parameters are εf=6.8, 

ωp~3.8eV  and  δ~-0.02eV.  In  the  frequency  region  that  we  are  interested,  the  whole 

visual  range,  these  values  give  a  satisfactory  good  fit  with  the  experimental  data  for 

both the real and the imaginary parts of the permittivity, as shown in Fig 2a. 

 

The transmission coefficient is presented in Fig.2b for a hole of diameter d=270nm in 

metal  film  with  thickness  t=340nm  for  the  permittivity  (Eq.1).  The  incidence  is  in 

normal direction with respect to the surface of the metal film. We also present results 

for a hole in ideal metal film with the same diameter and with thickness of t=340nm and 

750nm. The results are quite illuminating and tell us what is going on in the single hole 

transmission. It is clear that the transport using the theory of transport in waveguides in 

ideal metals which shows the first wavelength cutoff at λc=2πd/3.68=1.705d [14] only 

applies for large values of t=750nm (see Fig.2b). For comparison, the waveguide theory 

for  ideal  metal  with  much  larger  thickness  is  also  plotted.  For  the  values  of  t  smaller 

than  340nm  which  is  used  in  the  experiments,  a  hole  in  the  ideal  metal  gives  a 

considerable transmission in long wavelength tail. Even at λ=700nm, the coefficient is 

0.10.  Therefore  these  result  show  that  making  considerations  for  enhancement  of 

transmission  comparing  with  long  waveguide  in  ideal  metals  is  unphysical  and  not 

realistic. 

The  striking  result  is  that  when  calculate  the  transmission  with  Ag  film  using  the 

experimental  values  of  permittivity  for  Ag,  we  found  a  much  higher  transmittivity  at 

larger wavelengths. The cutoff has been moved from 460nm (ideal waveguide cutoff for 

d=270nm)  to  ~630nm.  Notice  the  results  presented  in  Fig.5a,  at  700nm  where  a 

transmittivity  peak  of  1.4  appears  for  the  hole  arrays,  one  single  hole  provides  a 

transmittivity of 0.5 in Fig 2b. So the transmission enhancement from hole arrays versus 

single  hole  is  only  a  factor  of  2.8.  Then  the  question  is:  why  has  the  real  Ag  the 

behaviour  of  large  transmission  at  large  wavelengths?  This  has  to  be  searched  in  the 

effect  of  surface  modes  located  at  the  cylindrical  cavity  defining  the  holes.  They  are 

similar  to  those  discussed  by  Pfeiffer,  Economou  and  Ngai  [6]  also  Martinos  and 

Economou  [7]  for  metallic  cylinders.  These  waves move the cutoff of transport in the 

structure  to  longer  wavelengths  and  are  the  responsibility  of  the  large  transmissions 

through the hole arrays for the observed peak at 700nm for the t=340nm as is the case of 

the experiments [1,3]. 

ii) Cylindrical surface waves. 

 

 

The surface plasmons excited in the cylindrical holes propagate the same way as those 

that  has  been  studied  on  the  surface  of  metallic  cylinder  [6,  7].  The  surface  plasmons 
locate  along  the  circumference  of  the  cylinder  with  wavelength  λθ

n=2πr/n,  i.e. 

circumference length divided by the index branch n. And the SPs also propagate along 

the cylinder axis z with a wave kz. The possibility of exciting long wavelength modes is 

given  by  the  cylindricality  α=2πr/λp,  where  λp  is  the  bulk  plasmon  wavelength  ( 

λp=325nm for Ag [8] ). This theory is done for Drude plasmon dispersion relation with 

δ=0 in (1). In our case we do not have a cylinder of infinite length as has been discussed 

in ref. 5 and 6, but we have a cylindrical metallic cavity of certain thickness t. However 

by looking at the boundary conditions the same kind of modes should exist and our full 

solution of Maxwell equations shows up in the transmission. In Fig. 4a modulations in 

the  transmission  can  be  identified,  which  actually  may  correspond  to  the  surface 

plasmons  modes  excited  in  the  cavity  surface.  The  peak  with  longer  wavelength 

corresponds  to  the  smaller  n,  n=1  identifies  the  longest  wavelength  surface  plasmons 

mode, i.e. there is a cutoff for the surface plasmons modes. 

This cutoff of the surface plasmons is determined by the dispersion relation of the n=1 

mode. The dispersion relation was studied with a planar approximation in ref. 6. As an 

approximation the cylindrical surface was treated as semi-infinite plane, the curvature of 

the  cylinder  was  considered  as  periodic  boundary  condition.  The  resulted  dispersion 

relation in the surface can be written as [6]:

where kp = 2π/λp and the cylindricality α=dkp/2 play an important role in the dispersion 

relation..  Fig.3a  actually  is  the  case  for  cylinder  holes  in  Ag  film  with  λp=325nm, 

diameter d=270nm, the same as in Fig 2b As shown in Fig. 3a, with fixed cylindricality 

parameter  α,  the  possible  modes  of  surface  plasmons  that  can  be  excited  at  the  cross 

points with the photon line are limited in wavelength.. From Fig.3a, the wavelength for 

the  possible  surface  plasmons  can  be  excited  in  the  cylinder  holes  is  in  range  of 

470nm~630nm.  The  630nm  corresponds  approximately  with  the  cutoff  for  the 

transmission  using  the  permittivity  in  Fig.2b.  There  are  also  weak  oscillations  in  the 

structure  of  the  transmission,  in  both  experiments  and  calculations  that  we  may 

tentatively assign to the different plasmons index n, in Fig.3a and in Fig.4 as well.  

However,  we  noticed  that  the  above  dispersion  relation  is  based  on  the  semi-infinite 

plane  approximation for  the cylindrical surface for a Drude metal with δ=0. The  peak 

structures are not expected to be completely matched with the experiments. In fact the n 

index  in  our  cylindrical  hole  structure  may  depart  considerably  of  those  given  by  (2) 

and  plotted  in  Fig.3a  to  illustrate  the  problem.  Still  our  holes  are  of  finite  small 

thickness while the theory of ref.6 is for infinite cylinders. The more important point is 

that this theory result explains the extra transmission above the waveguide cutoff limit. 

The  cylindrical  wave  is  excited  at  the  entrance  of  the  hole  and  it  carries  the  energy 

through  the  other  side  of  the  hole  which  is  not  allowed  in  ideal  waveguide.  It  is 

assuming  that  the  thickness  of  the  hole  is  not  big  enough  because  the  wave  has  a 

propagation decay length. When the thickness of the hole becomes larger than the decay 

length, the transmission will be controlled by the waveguide modes without cylindrical 

surface waves. We have performed calculations for Ag with d=270nm and changing the 

thickness t=340nm, 525nm and 735nm to check the propagation decay length, as shown 

in Fig. 3b. Clearly when t=735nm, the cutoff is retracted to 600nm, however still bigger 

than that of the ideal metal cutoff (~500nm) for t=750nm in Fig.2b. This establishes that 

the  transmission  in  a  hole  of  Ag  at  larger  wavelengths  (>500nm)  is  controlled  by 

cylindrical surface waves with a decay length that we estimated to be more than 1um, 

which  we  will  discuss  in  anther  work.  The  decay  should  depend  also  of  the  diameter 

because it limits the extension of the cylindrical wave into the vacuum in the hole, as 

 

 

well as of the thickness. 

iii) Comparison with Experiments 

 

 

 

Ref.2 has presented an ample number of experiments for single holes of different values 

of  d  and  t.  These  represent  a  good  set  of  experimental  data  to  contrast  with  our 

calculations.  Fig.4a  presents  the  experimental  data  (Ref.2,  Fig.2c)  as  well  as  the 

calculations for the same parameters as in the experiments. The comparison is strikingly 

good  for  all  the  cases.  Also,  as  is  important  we  plot  the  enhancement  for  the  case  of 

d=270nm.  This  is  defined  as  the  transmission  for  the  real  Ag  divided  by  the 

transmission  predicted  by  the  ideal  waveguide  theory  [14].  It  is  observed  that  this 

enhancement  can  be  up  to  1000.  Analogously  we  present  similar  results  in  Fig.4b  for 

the case of d=200nm and the enhancement is of the order of 10000. This proves that the 

enhancements by single holes we calculated are already of the order of those measured 

for  hole  arrays  in  Ref.1  and  claimed  to  be  due  to  SPPs  of  the  periodical  arrays. 

Calculations  and  experiments  [2]  prove  that  it  is  not  necessary  to  have  hole  arrays  in 

order to have such enhancements. This tends to rule out the SPP between the arrays as 

the  physical  reason  for  enhancement  from  arrays.  However  it  is  due to  the  cylindrical 

surface waves in the walls of the cavity drilled on the metal to have enhancement from 

single hole. It is clear that the influence of SPPs, if exist, is marginal for the large values 

observed  in  the  transmission  from  holes  arrays.  It  is  also  worth  to  notice  that  the 

transmission  of  a  single  hole  shows  weak  oscillations  as  we  tentative  assign  to  the 

different cylindrical surface waves index n indicated in Fig.3a. 

II.B. The Ag Case for Arrays of Holes 

We  now  proceed  by  discussing  the  transmission  of  light  through  an  array  of  holes 

following  the  same  procedures  discussed  above.  Since  a  single  hole  gives  such  an 

enhancement beyond the cut-off wavelength, it will not be a surprise that a periodical 

array will give also a very large enhancement. The result for an array will be produced 

by the interference of the waves merging from the holes. Therefore the transmission will 

have for some frequencies enhancements over the single hole transmission and for other 

frequencies depressions. Same ideas have been described in ref. 2, however our FDTD 

calculations  will  prove  all  at  once.  In  order  to  prove  this  we  have  performed  such 

calculations for periodical arrays of holes to compare with existing experimental results 

[2,  3].  Fig.5a  shows  the  transmission  results  for  the  periodical  array  with  P=600nm, 

d=270nm  and  t=225nm,  the  same  parameters  corresponding  to  the  data  presented  in 

Fig.1  of  ref.3.  The  agreement  is  again  strikingly  remarkable  and  without  fitting  any 

parameter,  just  taking  the  permittivity  of  Ag  [8].  The  three  experimental  peaks  at  λ≈ 

700nm,  550nm  and  430nm  are  excellently  described  not  only  the  peaks  positions  but 

also  the  measured  amplitude.  For  comparison  we  also  presented  the  existing  theory 

performed  in  ref.  3  in  which  a  rather  good  agreement  is  claimed.  In  fact,  there  is  not 

such an agreement because the calculations only show two peaks at 630nm and 460nm 

which are shifted from the three experimental peaks. Or to be more explicit, the peaks 

of the theory in ref. 3 correspond, not with the experimental peaks, but with the minima.  

Fig.5b  shows  comparison  for  the  experiments  in  ref.2  for  P=600nm,  d=250nm  and 

t=340nm  and  again  the  agreement  is  remarkable  in  the  peak  positions,  the  intensities 

and the enhancement with respect to a single hole intensities. Our calculations are for an 

infinity array of holes, while in the experiment the hole arrays are finite. However the 

experiments [2] showed that arrays of N×N holes yield practically the same results for 

N>9,  so  the  infinite  arrays  give,  as  shown  by  the  calculations,  practically  the  same 

answer at normal incidence. 

 

We  would  like  to  explain  a  little  bit  on  the  appearance  of  the  peaks  positions  in  the 

periodical arrays as following. Once the cylindrical surface plasmons are excited, there 

will be a comparative large transmission per hole. These plasmons radiate waves at the 

surface and then interfere. The peaks positions and their intensity are given by the value 

of the period P. The hole´s diameter intervenes in the peak intensities because when, for 

a given frequency, a large value of a single hole intensity falls at the same position that 

the ideal interference peak, then this interference peak shows a pronounced maximum. 

However if these conditions do not match, the peak of the array is much smaller. As an 

illustration  we  present  calculations  in  Fig.5c  for  d=200nm  and  P=600nm.  It  is  clearly 

seen  that  the  enhanced  peak  at  around  λ≈690nm  is  strongly  reduced  (compared  with 

Fig.5a,  5b  for  the  same  P  value),  because  the  single  hole  at  this  wavelength  has  little 

intensity as shown in Fig.4b (compared with Fig. 4a for different d value). This is also 

in  excellent  agreement  with  the  data  of  ref.2.  To  provide  further  information  as  a 

prediction result, we present in Fig.6a a set of calculations for the values of P=750nm, 

870nm  and  1050nm  with  same  d=270nm  and  t=340nm.  In  agreement  with  the 

discussion  above,  the  intensity  peaks  move  according  to  the  produced  interferences. 

This  shifts  their  peak  wavelengths  with  periodic  parameter  P.  Another  series  of 

transmission  are  also  calculated  (Fig.6b)  fixing  P=1200nm  and  t=340nm  but  for 

different d= 270nm, 300nm and 360nm. This time, the peak structure is always at the 

same position because P is fixed. However, the peaks change their intensity because d is 

varied.  Therefore  P  and  d  determined  the  peak  position  and  intensities  respectively. 

Moreover,  the  thickness  t  also  counts,  because  the  material  has  absorption  and  the 

plasmons  have  certain  decay  length.  Actually,  the  propagation  length,  the  plasmons 

speed and the retardations, etc [15] all play a role and show up in the experiments.  

 

 

II.C. The W Case for Single Holes 

In the frequency region we discussed, Ag is considered as a special case because of its 

ability  to  support  surface  wave  for  extra  transmission  with  respect  to  ideal  metal.  We 

would  like  to  see  how  the  holes  in  different  real  metals  transmit  wave  from  the  same 

hole´s  structure.  For  W,  in  the  whole  visible  frequency  range,  the  real  part  of  the 

permittivity is positive and approximately constant. It behaves as a dielectric. The SPP 

waves cannot be supported by this metal. Let us be no so definitive because this may 

need further discussion. But le us accept, at least, that the SPP waves, as those existing 

in Ag owning to permittivity (Equ.1) cannot be hold at the surface. Then, the question is 

should the transmission of the holes in W be very different from Ag case? 

To study the case of W in the calculation, its frequency dependent permittivity is set as:

a model used for a conductor, with εr >0 as the real part of the permittivity and σ as the 

conductivity. In the sense of optical transmission, the material governed by this model 

behaves as a dielectric but with big attenuation. It means that the wave will penetrate the 

material and meanwhile loss the energy because of the attenuation. It should be noticed 

that  in  an  ideal  metal  there  is  no  attenuation  and  neither  penetration,  which  actually 

plays  an  important  role  in  transmission  from  the  hole.  The  experimental  permittivity 

data  [9]  is  shown  in  Fig.7,  together  with  the  fitted  data  by  Equ.3  with  εr  =4  and 
σ=6.46×105s/m. 

The  calculation  result  of  transmission  from  a  single  hole  (d=300nm,  t=400nm,  the 

profile of the holes used in ref.2, Fig.3a for arrays) in W is presented in Fig. 8, together 

with the transmission for the same hole in an ideal metal. Their transmission profiles are 

similar but very different from Ag case in Fig. 2b and 4. The strong extra transmission 

beyond the cutoff in Ag case does not exist, which is consistent with fact that there are 

not surface cylindrical plasmons for W in the large wavelengths to transmit the wave. 

The other fact should be noticed is that the transmission is smaller than that of an ideal 

metal for λ<700nm. It is understandable, as we mentioned above, the wave in the hole 

will constantly penetrate into the metal, and the energy will be constantly killed because 

of  the  attenuation  nature  of  W.  We  verified  with  more  calculations  the  transmission 

becomes smaller and smaller till totally dies for bigger thickness of W film. However 

for  λ>700nm  the  transmittivity  for  W  overpass  that  of  the  ideal  metal.  This  is  due  to 

penetration,  which  makes  the  effective  hole  size  bigger.  Therefore  losses  and 

penetration of the wave interplay during the transmission.  

On the other hand, there is similarity between the W case and the ideal metal case. Once 

we calculate for a metal with the same model in Equ.3, but increasing σ by 200 times, 

the  resulted  transmission  is  almost  identical  as  ideal  metal  case.  To  understand  this 

result we should turn to the complex reflect index n=n+ik, where the imaginary part of 

the  permittivity  makes  εi  »εr,  so  that  n  ≈  k  »  1.  The  wave’s  decay  length  of  the 

penetration into the metal is therefore greatly reduced and the reflectivity is ~1. That is 

the  reason  this  model  gives  the  same  transmission  as  ideal  metal  does.  In  principle,  a 

hole  in  W  film  transmit  light  can  be  treated  the  same  as  waveguide  but  with  large 

attenuation. All this is a qualitative discussion. However for fixed d and t of the order of 

the experiments, ideal waveguides is not well defined. Then ideal metal and W provide 

more  transmission  than  expected  by  long  ideal  wavelengths.  This  needs  further  more 

discussion and the case of │ε│→ ∞ may be an interesting one for the t values discussed 

in this paper, yet we do not want to conclude it. 

 

 

II.D. The W case for arrays of holes 

We also perform calculations for the transmission of hole arrays in W film. The result is 

compared  with  the  experiment  in  ref.  2  for  the  same  structure,  d=300nm,  t=400nm, 

P=600nm. As shown in Fig.9, the calculation fits well to the experiments, for the whole 

profile, the peak positions and intensities. The peak position at λ~700nm is the same as 

those  in  Fig.5a  and  Fig  5b,  with  the  same  periodical  parameter  P,  but  with  totally 

different  material,  hole  size  and  thickness.  This  strongly  confirm  the  regularity  we 

discussed above in Ag case, that the transmission peaks of hole arrays are determined 

only by arrays periodic, the same conclusion that is mentioned in ref. 2. However, the 

intensity of the peaks in W case is 6 times smaller than those of Ag. It is merely because 

the transmittivity of single hole in W is smaller, by a similar factor, than that of Ag case 

in Fig.2b.  

Discussions and Conclusions 

From the calculations and observations made above we reach the following conclusions: 

1.  One  obvious  point,  yet  many  people  overlooked,  is  that  one  has  to  use  the 

experimental  data  of  the  dielectric  properties  of  the  metal  in  theoretical 

consideration. As well as the parameters (d and t) of the hole used. 

2.  Because  of  the  previous  point,  the  analysis  of  enhancements  in  terms  of  ideal 

calculations with approximations, like that used with Bethe theory or ideal metal 

long waveguides, cannot be used because it produces mislead conclusions even 

if the experiments are interesting and right. 

3.  Plasmonic metal, in particular the paradigmatic Ag, has long cutoff wavelength 

in the transmission because of cylindrical surface plasmons as discussed above 

and in earlier references 5-7. So far, the t values discussed in the experiments are 

shorter  than  the  decay  length  of  the  plasmons.  For  larger  values  of  t,  the 

transmission is drastically reduced and only remains the waveguide modes with 

losses.  More  experiments  should  be  performed  with  longer  t  to  clear  up  this 

point. Moreover we have made predictions of what may happen. 

4.  Dielectric  metals,  as  W  in  the  visible,  with  the  permittivity  as  given  in  Fig.7 

behave  in  a  particular  way.  There  is  absorption  and  penetration  of  the  wave 

function in the metal which reduced the transmission for short wavelengths, but 

increased it at large wavelength with respect to ideal metal (see Fig.8). 

5.  If the SPPs in the Ag cases we discussed, have an influence in the transmission 

of  the  holes  arrays,  it  seems  to  be  marginal;  i.e.  is  a  small  factor.  The 

experiments prove this as well as our calculations. 

6.  The transmission peak positions of the arrays are given by the period P, and are 

material  independent.  Their  intensity  amplitude  is  large  only  if  the  single  hole 

transmission  is  large.  A  paradigmatic  effect  of  this  is  given  in  Fig  5a,  5c  and 

Fig.6. 

7.  It  appears  that  for  the  frequency  discussed,  Ag  holds  SPPs  and  W  does  not. 

However  the  existence  of  other  possible  surface  waves  that  could  enhance  the 

field at the surface it is not clear yet. 

Insisting  in  the  SPPs  enhancements  and  in  the  marginal  role  that  they  play  in  the 

experiments at hand, we believe that it is because the structure of the holes has many 

large  Fourier  components  which  reduce  the  enhancement  (see  ref.11-13)  of  the  field 

amplitude at the surface. However there are surface profiles of the hole´s structures that 

may produce the desired effect. If this is possible there could be a multiplicative effect: 

one due to SPPs and the other to the cylindrical waves. In this sense, to work out with 

Ag, W and Cr choosing carefully the structures and the frequencies may give surprises. 

More experimental data are also needed changing the structures and the values of d and 

t. For example, what happens for squared holes?

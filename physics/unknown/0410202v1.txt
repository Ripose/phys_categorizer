The control of fluctuations generated in an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) plasma is 

attempted by changing microwave powers. It is found that when a cage is introduced in 

the  vacuum  chamber,  the  fluctuations  change from  turbulent  state  to chaotic  state  in 

the high microwave power region while it changes from chaotic state to periodic state in 

the  low  microwave  power  region.  This  result  suggests  that  the  geometry  of  the  cage 

affects  the  state  of  the  instability.  Moreover  it  is  found  that  the  superposition  of 

multicusped fields created by small permanent magnets reduces the chaotic dimension 

of  the  instability.  When  pulsed  multipole  magnetic  fields  are  also  added  to  external 

magnetic fields, the fluctuations are suppressed.

There is an increasing interest in chaos and turbulence generated in plasmas 

[1]. Chaos and turbulence are often troublesome phenomena which may have harmful 

consequence. Such systems reach turbulent state via chaos. Therefore, the investigation 

of controlling chaos will contribute to an understanding of turbulence in fusion-oriented 

plasmas. Chaos in high temperature plasmas will evolve into fully developed turbulence 

and  lead  to  the  anomalous  transport.  Suppression  of  turbulence  is  necessary  for 

improving the confinement. 

There  are  some  reports  about  the  controlling  of  instabilities  in  plasma  [2-5]. 

Especially, chaos control is one of the most powerful methods because it does not need 

high power to control [6-7]. However, chaos control is only effective when the system is 

in  chaos  state. Therefore,  the  transition  of  the  system  from turbulent  state  to chaotic 

state is important for chaos control. Matsukuma et al. found that the ion-ion instability 

excited in double plasma was changed from turbulent state to chaos state by applying a 

mesh  grid  as  a  boundary  condition  [8].  Itoh  et  al.  examined  the  role  of  a  boundary 

condition by simulation and reported that a certain boundary condition upon the system 

reduced the number of degrees of freedom and as the result the state of system changed 

[9]. Thus, it is considered that the boundary condition has great influence on the state of 

instability. 

Recently, we found that the density fluctuation in electron cyclotron resonance 

(ECR) plasma [10-12] was excited by flute instability and the instability was suppressed 

by  superimposing  a  permanent  magnet  cage  [12].  Moreover,  it  was  found  that  the 

superimposing of the multicusped fields formed by the permanent magnet cage changed 

the behavior of the fluctuation from turbulent state to chaos state [1], suggesting that 

the permanent magnet cage may play a role of a boundary condition in our preliminary 

experiment. In the previous experiment, however, it was not clear whether or not the 

change of the instability was caused by the multicusped fields formed by the permanent 

magnet  cage.  Furthermore,  the  permanent  magnet  cage  may  change  the  geometry  of 

the experimental system, that is, there is a possibility that the change of the geometry 

caused the chaos state of the instability. 

Since the permanent magnet cage can not vary the intensity of magnetic fields, 

the  coils  which  generate  the  multipole  fields  is  put  into  place  around  the  vacuum 

 

    

chamber.

Figure.1 shows a schematic diagram of 

the  experimental  setup  of  ECR  plasma.  The 

vacuum  chamber  is  made  of  stainless-steal 

whose  size  is  400mm  in  inner  diameter  and 

1200mm  in  length.  Eight  magnetic  coils  are 

used  to  form  the  magnetic  mirror  field.  The 

chamber is evacuated using a rotary pump and 

a turbomolecular pump to abase pressure of less 

than  3x10-6  Torr.  A  magnetron  generates  the 

of ECR plasma 

Fig.1  Schematic  diagram  of  the  experimental  setup 

microwaves  (2.45GHz,  max  power  1kW),  which  can  modulate  the  power  by  external 

signal.  The  microwaves  are  launched  as  the  circular  TE11  mode  into  the  chamber 

through  the  tapered  waveguide  and  the  quartz  window.  The  used  gas  is  Argon.  The 

plasma parameters are measured with a cylindrical Langmuir probe (1 mm in diameter 

and 1mm in length). Experimental gas pressure is around 0.5 mTorr. The ECR plasma 

generated  by  the  microwaves  of  500W  has  following  features,  the  electron  density 

ne~1010[cm-3] and the electron temperature Te~4[eV]. 

The magnetic cage consisted of magnetic pillars is shown in Fig. 2. The magnetic pillars 

are  made  from  stainless-covered  permanent  magnets,  whose  dimensions  are  24  mm 

square and 561 mm in length. The pillars are aligned to form the multicusped magnetic 

field. The dimensions of the cage are 290 mm in diameter and 500 mm in length. The 

cage without magnetic field (dummy magnetic cage) is obtained by replacing magnetic 

pillars with stainless pillars that did not contain permanent magnets. 

Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of the coil which generates the multipole magnetic fields 

located  around  the  vacuum  chamber.  Pulsed  electric  current  is  flown  by  the  eight- 

condensers  of  capacitances  of  37.6  mF.  The  maximum  charge  voltage  is  300  V.  The 

intensity  of  the  multipole  fields  is  approximately  150  gauss  at  measurement  point 

against the background magnetic field 650 gauss.

Figure 4 (a) shows time series data of the floating potential fluctuation without the 

cage.  The  frequency  of  the  fluctuation  was  about  4.5  kHz.  It  was  confirmed  that  the 

observed  fluctuation  had  characteristics  of  the  flute  instability  [13],  i.e.,  the  phase 

difference between density fluctuation and potential fluctuation was out of phase at the 

same point, the fluctuation grew at the point where the density profile had the gradient, 

and  the  phase  of  the  fluctuation  was  constant  along  the  direction  parallel  to  the 

magnetic  field.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4  (a),  time  series  data  shows  relatively  periodic 

behavior in the low microwave power region, 150 W, and becomes chaotic behavior as 

the incident microwave power is increased.   

Then, we performed chaos analysis from time series data shown in Fig. 4 (a) in order to 

evaluate  whether  the  system  was  in  chaos  state  or  not.  A  correlation  dimension  was 

calculated  by  using  the  method  of  Grassberger  and  Procaccia  [14].    If  the  correlation 

dimension saturates to an integer with increasing the embedding dimension, the system 

is periodic and if it saturates to a fraction, the system is chaotic. If it does not saturate, 

the  system  is  turbulent.  The  calculated  result  is  shown  in  Fig.  4  (b).  The  correlation 

dimension saturates to non-integer 3.5 for 150 W, wheile it does not saturate for 450 W. 

Therefore, it is found that the instability changed from chaos state to turbulent state as 

the incident microwave power was increased. 

Then, the effect of multicusped fields on the fluctuation is confirmed by inserting the 

magnetic  cage  into  the  chamber.  Figure  5  shows  (a)  time  series  data  and  (b)  the 

calculated  correlation  dimension  of  the  floating  potential  fluctuation  with  the 

multicusped magnetic fields. Comparing Fig. 5 (a) with Fig. 4 (a), it is clearly seen that 

the  behavior  of  the  fluctuation  changes  more  periodic  for  150  W.  This  change 

corresponds to the result of calculated correlation dimensions. As shown in Fig. 5 (b), 

the correlation dimension in the presence of the magnetic cage saturates to integer, 3, 

that  is,  the  system  is  in  periodic  state.  On  the  other  hand,  the  correlation  dimension 

saturates to non-integer 4.2 even if the incident microwave power is increased up to 450 

W. These results suggest the stabilization of the instability was achieved by using the 

magnetic  cage.  Moreover,  comparing  to  Fig.4  (a),  note  that  the  amplitude  of  the 

fluctuation is suppressed when the magnetic cage is superimposed for 150 W, while it 

does  not  change  very  much  for  450  W.  From  this  result,  it  is  considered  that  the 

suppression  of  the  instability  by  the  magnetic  cage  is  effective  in  the  low  microwave 

power region. 

In  order  to  examine  the  effect  of  magnetic  fields,  the  dummy  magnetic  cage  is 

replaced with the magnetic cage. This cage consisted of stainless pillars whose size is 

the same as that of the stainless-covered magnet pillars. The results are shown in Fig. 6. 

The  calculated  correlation  dimension  shows  a  non-integer  5.5  for  450  W,  while  it 

changes to an integer 5 for 150 W. This means that the state of fluctuation changed from 

chaotic  state  to  periodic  state  by  adding  the  dummy  magnetic  cage.  Thus,  it  is 

considered that the state of the fluctuation changes by the geometry of the cage rather 

than the magnetic field of the cage. The change of the plasma edge condition by adding 

the cage is considered to be the main reason for the change of the state of the instability. 

Moreover, it is reported that the reduction of the system size associates with the positive 

Lyapunov exponent [15]. Therefore, the addition of the cage is considered to be effective 

to  control  the  chaotic  state  of  the  instability.  However,  the  correlation  dimension  is 

higher compared with the case of using the magnetic cage. This result indicates that the 

magnetic  fields  of  the  cage  reduce  the  chaotic  dimension  of  the  instability.  It  is 

considered that the magnetic fields restrict the particle motion and reduce the number 

of degrees of freedom. Therefore, the reduction of the number of degrees of freedom may 

result in the reduction of the chaotic dimension. Moreover, the magnetic field may affect 

the  instability  directly, because  the  flute  instability  is  caused  by  the  bad  curvature of 

the magnetic field.

To control the fluctuations multipole magnetic fields are added into the mirror 

magnetic fields. The multipole magnetic fields are created by pulsed coil current with a 

coil set up around the chamber. The intensity of the multipole fields is approximately 

150  gauss  at  measurement  point  against  the  background  magnetic  field  650  gauss. 

Fig.8 shows the time series data of Iis when the multipole magnetic fields are applied. 

The  upper  figure  shows  the  fluctuation  of  the  ion  saturation  current,  the  lower  one 

shows  the  intensity  of  the  multipole  magnetic  fields.  From  this  figure  it  is  clear  to 

suppress the amplitude of the fluctuations with the adding multipole magnetic fields. 

The  amplitude  of  the  fluctuations  is  half  as  high  as  that  of  the  fluctuation  without 

pulsed multipole magnetic fields. The suppression is not caused by the flatness of the 

radial  profile of the plasma density. On the contrary it was observed that the density 

gradient becomes a little steep. It is concludeed that the improvement of the magnetic 

configuration by the pulsed multipole magnetic fields has resulted in the suppression of 

the fluctuations.

Fig.7  suppression  of  the  fluctuation  cased  by  multipole  magnetic  fields;  lower  graph  shows  the  intensity  of  the  multipole 

magnetic field. Upper graph shows the fluctuations of the ion saturation current.   

We  observed  the  fluctuations  caused  by  the  flute  instability  in  an  ECR  plasma. 

The behavior of the instability changed from chaotic state to turbulent state, as incident 

microwave  power  was  increased.  It  was  found  that  the  magnetic  cage  stabilized  the 

instability from chaotic state to periodic state in the low microwave power region, from 

turbulent state to chaotic state in the high microwave power region. It was also found 

that  the  dummy  magnetic  cage  also  stabilized  the  instability,  although  the  chaotic 

dimension was high compared with the case of using magnetic cage. Therefore, it was 

considered that the change of the plasma edge condition due to the geometry of the cage 

was the main reason for the change of the state of the instability. And with regard to the 

addition of the multicusped fields, it reduced the number of degrees of freedom of the 

system and reduced the chaotic dimension of the instability.   

The  fluctuations  were  suppressed  with  the  use  of  the  multipole  magnetic  fields, 

which was caused by improvement of the minimum B configuration. This experimental 

result indicates that the magnetic configuration is also one of the dominant factors for 

controlling  chaos.  Furthermore,  there  may  be  some  methods  to  control  chaos  using 

electric  fields.  Very  recently  we  have  started  the  experiments  on  chaos  control  by 

modulating the microwave power.

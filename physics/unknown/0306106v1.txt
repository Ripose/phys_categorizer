Abstract 
The term beta-beam has been coined for the production of a pure beam of electron 
neutrinos or their antiparticles through the decay of radioactive ions circulating in a 
storage ring. This concept requires radioactive ions to be accelerated to a Lorentz gamma 
of 150 for 6He and 60 for 18Ne. The neutrino source itself consists of a storage ring for 
this energy range, with long straight sections in line with the experiment(s). Such a decay 
ring does not exist at CERN today, nor does a high-intensity proton source for the 
production of the radioactive ions. Nevertheless, the existing CERN accelerator 
infrastructure could be used as this would still represent an important saving for a beta-
beam facility. This paper outlines the first study, while some of the more speculative 
ideas will need further investigations.

Introduction 
The evolution of neutrino physics demands new schemes to produce intense, collimated, 
pure neutrino beams. In the current paper, we discuss the feasibility of a new concept 
[zuc02] for the production of a single flavour (electron) neutrino beam with a well-known 
energy spectrum. If combined with an intense pion source for the production of muon 
neutrinos, the beta-beam can address similar physics issues as the muon neutrino factory 
[mez02]. The scheme relies on existing technology. 
 
The acceleration of an intense radioactive ion beam to high energies is a new domain in 
the field of accelerator physics [aut02]. In the following we have limited ourselves to the 
possibility of basing a facility on parts of the existing CERN infrastructure, namely the 
Proton Synchrotron (PS) and the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS).

Radioactive ion production 
The beta-emitting radioactive ions will be produced in an isotope separator on-line 
(ISOL) system using the proposed Superconducting Proton Linac [spl00] (SPL) as a 
driver. Plans are being drawn up for a new European radioactive beam facility, 
EURISOL [eur00], where the method would be exploited to its fullest. 

Ionisation and bunching 
The ISOL method produces intense dc beams of ions in low charge states. This beam is 
accelerated to 50 MeV/u by cyclotrons, injected into a storage ring using charge 
exchange injection combined with phase space painting, bunched and ejected towards a 
fast cycling synchrotron. In the latter machine the ions are accelerated to 300 MeV/u and 
transferred to the PS.

Acceleration 
The PS accumulates16 bunches one at a time. They are then accelerated, merged in pairs 
to 8 bunches and transferred to the SPS. The transfer of ions from the PS to the SPS is a 
well-known space charge bottleneck. In our baseline scenario, bunches fill the maximum 
available transverse aperture of the SPS and the individual bunch intensity is kept low. 
The bunches are accelerated in the SPS to the required energy for the chosen ion type. 
The shortest possible magnetic cycle of the SPS will be used, but it will still induce a 
dead-time in the production and accumulation which, for SPS top energy, will be close to 
8 seconds. 

Transfer to decay ring 
The ions are injected in 2 batches of 4 bunches per SPS pulse onto a dispersion-matched 
orbit in the decay ring and rotated in longitudinal phase space to bring them to the energy 
of the 4 stored bunches.  

Accumulation in the decay ring 
A new merging technique is used to combine the injected bunches longitudinally with 
those already circulating in the decay ring.  The 2 batches are merged one at a time with 
minimal longitudinal emittance dilution. Many shots can be accumulated until an 
equilibrium is reached due to beam losses. 

Production methods for Qe emitters 
To exploit a maximum part of the existing CERN accelerator infrastructure requires  
isotopes that are not too short-lived. For half-lives far below 1 s the decay losses during 
the acceleration process would become excessive. On the other hand, the half-life should 
not be too long in order to provide a sufficient production rate in the decay ring. 

- emitters 
E
Table 1 shows candidate β- emitters. Assuming a limited space charge capacity of the 
storage ring and completely stripped ions, it is evident that more low-Z isotopes can be 
stored at a time than high-Z ones. Thus the figure of merit (number of decays per second 
divided by the average neutrino energy which determines the opening angle of the 
neutrino beam [zuc02]) is highest for low-Z isotopes. 8He and 9Li are considered to be 
too short-lived for efficient acceleration. Thus 6He is the best candidate.

Production of 6He 
For the production of 6He it is preferable to use a direct reaction with high cross-section 
and little power dissipation of the primary beam. One could consider the 6Li(n,p)6He or 
the 9Be(n,α)6He reactions. The former has an energy threshold of En > 2.7 MeV, the latter 
of only En > 0.6 MeV. The cross-section of 9Be(n, α) peaks around 100 mb and remains 
above 25 mb for neutrons between 1.6 and 15 MeV, while the cross-section of 6Li(n,p) 
reaches only 35 mb at maximum. Moreover, Be is more suitable as an ISOL target since 
it is far more refractory than Li, in particular when bound as BeO. 
 
The required flux of fast neutrons can be produced externally, e.g. by high-energy proton-
induced spallation in a heavy metal “converter” mounted close to the ISOL target 
[Rav02]. With a 100 µA proton beam at 2.2 GeV kinetic energy some 1013  6He atoms 
per second could be produced in the target. Experience with oxide targets [Koe02] shows 
that the He release from BeO should be faster than from metallic Be. In addition, the 
former is more refractory allowing stable operation at high temperatures. For all oxide 
fibre targets discussed in [Koe02], over 80% of the produced 6He is released before its 
decay. Thus, with a beryllia fibre target, which could be heated to still higher 
temperatures, the efficient release from a large-volume target should also be feasible. 

+ emitters 
E
Table 2 shows candidate β+ emitters. Boron can react with many elements typically used 
in ISOL targets and ion sources (C, N, O, metals) and is therefore barely released. No 
ISOL beams of boron have been produced up to now. 33Ar is too short-lived for an 
efficient acceleration in the present scenario and 34Ar is also rather short-lived. This 
leaves 18Ne as the best candidate. As a noble gas it is inert against reactions with the 
target and ion source materials and can thus be released efficiently even from a bigger 
target.

Production of 18Ne 
18Ne can be produced by spallation in a target (Na, Mg, Al, Si) with cross-sections of the 
order of 1 mb at 2.2 GeV. Candidate compounds for an ISOL target are e.g. MgO, MgS, 
Al2O3, Al4C3 or SiC. Using, for example, a 1 m long MgO target of 20% theoretical 
density would produce about 1x1010 18Ne per µC of primary proton beam, i.e. 1x1012 
18Ne per second from a 100 µA proton beam. Note that the 2.2 GeV protons lose only 
about 130 MeV of their energy when traversing such a target. Thus, in principle, the 
exiting proton beam could be sent onto a secondary production target behind. To avoid a 
local overheating of the target material, the proton beam has to be spread or scanned over 
a sufficiently large target cross-section to disperse the 13 kW beam power. Thus the 
target volume will reach several dm3. It still needs to be studied how efficient the release 
of 18Ne from such a target will be. To handle a further increase of the proton beam 
intensity would require a still bigger target or a system of multiple independent targets. 

Ionisation scenarios for Qe emitters 
The produced radioactive elements effuse out of the target container as neutral atoms, and 
must efficiently and rapidly be ionised in an ion source to reduce the decay losses. The 
radioactive gas flux from the target is semi-continuous, as the driver beam repetition rate 
is 50 or 75 Hz. Thus, ideally, the radioactive elements should be collected and ionised 
during the ramping time of the SPS and then extracted with a pulse length of <100 µs for 
fast injection into the circular machines. With present technology, this is several orders of 
magnitude away in terms of the required space-charge capacity. Nevertheless, alternative 
solutions may be viable. Firstly, the space charge can be reduced by shortening the 
collection time to ~2.5 half-lives, that is to 2 s for 6He and 4 s for 18Ne, as the particle 
gain for longer collection times is negligible due to decay. Secondly, highly efficient ion 
source concepts have recently been developed. 

ECR ion source alternative 
A compact ECR ion source, with high ionisation efficiency for noble gases (45% for He 
[Jar02a] and >90% for Ne [Jar02a,Oya98]), connected directly to the target outlet 
minimises the effusion delay time. The extracted dc beam consists mainly of He+ (Ne+), 
with a He2+ (Nen+) fraction of a few percent. The ionisation time of 50 and 150 ms for 
90% of the total number of ions for He and Ne [Jar02b] is relatively short compared with 
the half-life. Such a source has no ion-storing capability and the ions leave the plasma 
volume continuously within some milliseconds after ionisation1. Assuming the 
                                                 
1 An electrostatic pulsed extraction has been shown to have a limited blocking effect on the beam and works efficiently 
mainly for repetition frequencies above 500 Hz [Jeo96].

radioactive gas fluxes above, a radioactive current of 10 µA is reached. This is far below 
the several mA that an ECR source is capable of delivering. A cold transfer line between 
target and ion source suppresses the influx of condensable elements. A separator magnet 
is inserted after the source to separate the radioactive ions from the carrier gas ions. 
 

Injection into the storage ring 
The requirements for the transverse emittance in the decay ring for the beta-beam are 
relaxed. This helps to overcome the space charge bottleneck between the PS and SPS. It 
also sets a generous upper limit for the physical emittance in the storage ring (see Table 
3), which is important considering the long injection times required to transform the dc 
beam from the cyclotrons to a bunched beam suitable for synchrotrons. The beam will be 
injected using a combination of charge-exchange injection through a thin foil and phase 
space painting. The latter will reduce the number of passages through the foil for each 
ion, which will reduce losses and angular straggling of the ions. This process has not 
been studied in detail but charge exchange injection for stable He and Ne ions is routinely 
used at the The Svedberg laboratory in Uppsala [rei00].

The  SPS  was  designed  for  fixed-target  physics.  The  machine  is  well  adapted  to  handle 
beams  with  small  momentum  spread,  moderate  bunch  intensity  and  large  transverse 
emittance.  The LHC beam has large momentum spread, high bunch intensity and small 
transverse emittance.  In fact, the physical emittance is only of the order of 1 µm at SPS 
injection,  whereas  the  vertical  acceptance  approaches  20  µm.    This  alone  should  allow 
the missing factor in Table 4 to be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. The SPS 
cycle for the LHC involves a long wait for up to 4 PS batches, whereas the single beta-
beam bunch could even be injected into a moving bucket.  This means that the beta-beam 
could probably tolerate a larger initial tune shift. A further factor of 5 could be gained by 
installing a moderate (∼1 MV) 40 MHz rf system in the SPS.  This would be sufficient to 
accelerate the ions to near  transition, where the  bunch would naturally be short enough 
for the standard 200 MHz system to take over.  

Induced radiation in the machines 
Since the radioactive nuclei have a relatively short lifetime, a large portion of the initial 
beam will decay during acceleration. Activation of the machines will therefore be an 
issue. As nuclei change their charge in beta-decay, one could imagine a design for the 
new purpose-built low-energy machines such that most of these decays occur in the 
straight sections and the magnets act as separators directing the decay products to 
dedicated beam dumps. In the existing machines, this might not be so easy. In the PS, for 
example, there are no long straight sections, so the decay losses would be more or less 
evenly distributed in the machine.

where N is the number of particles, E0 is the rest energy of the nuclei, and t1/2 is the half-
life at rest of the ion species. The factor γ-1 comes from the kinetic energy, and γ-1 from 
the time dilatation. For sufficiently high values of γ, the loss power is thus energy 
independent; it only depends on the number of particles in the machine. 
 
Averaging over the acceleration cycle and assuming that losses are evenly distributed 
around the machine, one obtains the power per unit length. This is what ultimately 
determines the activation of the machine. Typically, 1 W/m is quoted as an acceptable 
upper limit, since for 1 GeV protons it produces an activation just below the US limit for 
“hands-on” maintenance (100 rem). However, the activation is energy dependent. 
Simulations made for the SNS show that the activation for a fixed loss power increases 
with energy up to 1 GeV [har99]. Analytic calculations show that, since high-energy 
particles are not absorbed in the machine components, the machine activation actually 
decreases with energy at higher energies [sul92]. Instead, the particles traverse the 
machine and activate the shielding.

The average deposited power due to beta decay, calculated for the PS and SPS, is given 
in Table 5. It can be seen that the PS is just above the 1 W/m limit. Of course, one must 
also add normal losses to these numbers.

losses are taken into account. 

Losses in the decay ring 
The losses in the high-energy storage ring can be estimated using the fact that no beam is 
ejected. All injected beam is essentially lost somewhere in the machine. Hence 

P =

tot

EN
inj

rep

 

where Ninj in the number ions in each injected batch, E is the kinetic energy of the ions, 
and trep is the injection repetition rate. 
 
With the proposed layout of the decay ring, about 14 % of the beta decay products end up 
in each arc, and 36 % decay in each of the straight sections. For 6He, this correspond to 
an energy deposition of 8.9 W/m in the arcs, and 56 kW in a hot spot downstream of the 
first bend after the straight sections. To control losses in the straight sections, some kind 
of separation scheme at the end of each section could be employed to separate decay 
products from the beam and dump them in a controlled way. 
 
The magnitude of the losses probably excludes the use of superconducting magnets, 
thereby increasing the length of the decay ring. 
 
The losses that are not due to beta decay will be dominated by longitudinal acceptance 
limitations due to the stacking method. Momentum collimation might be required to 
control these losses.

Cooling  
To reach the desired intensity, stacking will be required in the high energy decay ring. 
Without cooling, Liouville’s theorem restricts the stacking process. If electron cooling 
could be used in the decay ring, it could increase the stacking efficiency. All operational 
electron coolers today work below about 1 GeV/u. High and medium energy electron 
cooling is currently investigated at Brookhaven [bur00], Fermilab [nag00]and DESY 
[bal00]. Calculations carried out for 150 GeV protons in the Tevatron yield cooling times 
of about 5 minutes [der00]. Re-scaling this result for 6He2+ and 18Ne10+ gives 7.5 and 1.4 
minutes, respectively. Given that the injection repetition rate in the decay ring is 8 s, 
electron cooling would therefore not have any significant effect on the stacking 
efficiency. Stochastic cooling is also excluded. This is because there are too many 
particles per bunch. 

Bunch rotation stacking in the beta-beam decay ring 
The decay ring is an accumulator of the bunches delivered by the injector chain. 
Accumulation is required because the half-life of the stored ions is more than an order of 
magnitude longer than the cycling time of the injectors. It is complicated by the need to 
stack the beam in only a few bunches and by the fact that cooling is excluded. One 
approach is to use asymmetric bunch pair merging, which combines adjacent bunches in 
longitudinal phase space such that a small bunch can be embedded in the densest region 
of a much larger one with minimal emittance dilution. 
 
A fresh bunch must be injected in the neighbouring bucket to an existing bunch in the 
stack, but this is excluded using conventional kickers and septa because of the short rise 
time that would be required.  An alternative injection scheme exploits the fact that the 
stack is located at only one azimuth in the decay ring and that the revolution period is 
relatively long.  The new bunches are off momentum and are injected in a high dispersion 
region on a matched dispersion trajectory.  Subsequently, each injected bunch rotates a 
quarter turn in longitudinal phase space until the initial conditions for bunch pair merging 
are met. 
 
The starting point is a series of 4 consecutive stack bunches in a dual-harmonic system in 
the decay ring.  In order to satisfy the bunch length requirements imposed by the 
experiments, 40 and 80 MHz rf systems are needed. The total length of the four-bunch 
train is approximately 1 µs, thus occupying 1/20 of the circumference of the machine.

Right, Start of bunch pair merging. The horizontal time axis on each plot is 25 ns. 
 

Prior to injection, the second harmonic component is reduced to zero and local closed-
orbit bump pushes the circulating bunches towards the blade of the magnetic injection 
septum. Each new bunch arrives in phase with a circulating one, but separated from it in 
momentum by an amount which provides the space for the septum blade in the dispersion 
region. 
 
The local orbit bump must collapse sufficiently during one turn (~20 µs) to bring the 
injected bunches across the septum blade. One quarter of a synchrotron period after 
injection, each new bunch has rotated to the same momentum as the stacked ones and a 
suitably phased second-harmonic component is snapped on. This is the starting point for 
asymmetric bunch pair merging. 
 
Given that the half-lives of 6He and 18Ne are both of the order of two minutes at their 
respective top energies while the cycling time of the injector chain is of the order of 8 s, it 
is clear that each bunch of the stack will have a longitudinal emittance that is more than 
an order of magnitude larger than that of an incoming bunch. Asymmetric bunch pair 
merging allows the fresh, dense bunch to be deposited at the centre of the large 
accumulated one. Thus the oldest ions are moved to the edge of the stack and, due to their 
decay, a steady state is reached. Bunch characteristics throughout the baseline scenario 
are presented in Table 6.

Merging simulation 
As a proof of principle, the accumulation of a complete stack has been crudely simulated 
(using the SPS as a model for the decay ring).  The full-blown scheme sees two batches 
each of four bunches transferred and stacked in the decay ring.  This takes of the order of 
one second.

Asymmetric merging is achieved by controlling the relative phase of the two rf 
components as a function of their decreasing voltage ratio such that the acceptance of the 
inner bucket containing the stack bunch is gradually reduced while that containing the 
fresh bunch is maintained.  The simulation simply took a single injected bunch of 6He 
after its quarter turn rotation and stacked this particle distribution again and again.  At 
each repetition, some of the resultant stack was removed at random corresponding to the 
expected number of 6He decays.  A steady state was reached at an intensity, which was 
within 20% of that which would have been achieved with a stacking efficiency of 100%.  
This revealed that, provided the emittance of the injected bunch can be kept below 1 eVs, 
the order of magnitude of the rf voltages required for merging is restricted to a 
comparatively modest 10 MV. The final intensity of a bunch in the decay ring can exceed 
ten times that of an injected bunch. 

Conclusions 
A  possible  scenario  for  accelerating  radioactive  ions  for  a  beta-beam  facility  has  been 
developed. It makes use of large parts of the existing CERN accelerator infrastructure and 
ties  up  with  other  CERN  activities,  such  as  ISOLDE  and  the  muon  neutrino  beam. 
Several possible showstoppers have been circumvented, but much work is still required if 
the facility is ever to be built. Especially, using the concept of charge exchange injection 
for  the  bunching  of  the  DC  beam  in  the  low  energy  accumulator  ring  needs  further 
analysis.  Furthermore, machine activation is a major problem and only  a detailed study 
can show if it will be possible to handle the losses. Still, it is important that the beta-beam 
concept  be  studied.  A  “green  field”  scenario  free  from  the  limitations  imposed  by  the 
existing CERN accelerator infrastructure should also be considered for a complete picture 
of the possibilities offered by this exciting concept.

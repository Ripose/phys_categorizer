Abstract 
This  study  focus  on  the  acoustical  behavior  of  gearbox  induced  by  the  static  transmission 
error under load (STE). An original method is developed allowing to compute simultaneously 
STE,  meshing  and  bearings  stiffnesses.  These  characteristics  mainly  govern  the  vibrational 
and the acoustical behaviors of the geared system. The proposed procedure is based on two 
computational methods allowing to calculate the STE and the bearing equilibrium which are 
integrated  in  a  coupled  computational  procedure.  The  technique  has  been  implemented  to 
treat  an  illustrating  example  and  compared  to  standard  uncoupled  approach.  Comparative 
results concern the STE, meshing stiffness, bearings stiffnesses, shafts misalignments, critical 
eigenmodes  and  associated  critical  running  speeds,  housing  vibratory  response  and  radiated 
noise. 

1. Introduction 
It  is  well  known  that  the  static  transmission  error  under  load  (STE)  constitutes  the  main 
source  of  radiated  gearbox  noise  [1].  Furthermore,  there  exist  several  operating  speeds  for 
which  STE  induces  high  vibratory  and  noise  levels.  Those  critical  speeds  are  related to  the 
excitation in a resonant manner of some particular eigen-modes mainly governed by the mesh 
and  bearings  stiffnesses.  So,  an  important  key  for  predicting  gear  noise  concerns  the 
estimation  of  STE,  mesh  and  bearing  stiffnesses.  Contact  conditions  and  STE  depend  not 
only on teeth elasticity and manufactured errors, but also on bearings and shaft deformations. 
Actually,  they  modify  the  toothed  wheels  positions  and  by  the  way  they  introduce 
misalignments  between  mating  teeth  in  the  action  plane.  Otherwise,  nonlinear  bearings 
stiffnesses  depend  on  generalized  forces  applied  on  shafts  induced  by  the  teeth  load 
distribution.  These  generalized  forces  are  a  priori  distinct  from  theoretical  ones.  So,  in 
accordance  with  the  gearbox  design,  interactions  between  meshing  contact  conditions  and 
bearings deformations may exist. Unfortunately, in our knowledge, those interactions are not 
taken into account in standard approach. In this context, this study proposes a new modeling 
approach  allowing  to  estimate  simultaneously  STE, meshing  and  bearings stiffnesses. More 
precisely,  this  modeling  described  in  section 2  is  based  on  a  coupled  calculation  including 
non  linear  deformations  of  each  bearing  and  meshing  gear.  In  section 3,  the  proposed 

modeling is illustrated on an example of geared system. Comparisons with usual uncoupled 
approach  are  performed.  Comparative  results  concern  the  STE,  meshing  stiffness,  bearings 
stiffnesses,  critical  eigenmodes  and  related  critical  speeds,  housing  vibratory  response  and 
associated radiated noise. 

2. Review of the method 

2.1 STE computational method 
STE  is  obtained  by  solving  the  static  equilibrium  of  the  gear  pair  for  a  set  of  successive 
rotational  positions  of  the  driving  wheel.  For  this  end,  the  theoretical  tooth  contact  lines 
contained  in  the  action  plane  are  discretized  in  a  some  number  of  slices.  At  each  slice,  the 
unknown  contact  load  is  assumed  to  be  positive  or  null  (column  vector  p).  The  calculus 
requires  knowledge  of  C,  the  compliance  matrix  acting  between  slices.  This  matrix  can  be 
obtained  from  a  previous  3D  finite  element  model  of  the  mating  teeth.  It  requires  also 
knowledge of manufacturing errors which are introduced as a vector e of initial gap at each 
slice.  Finally,  the  in  plane  action  misalignment  (ϕ1-ϕ2)  =  φ  induced  by  the  shafts,  bearings 
and housing deformations is taken into account separately from vector e. The contact problem 
to solve can be written as follows: 

  C p = d.i + e + φ.g   and   tp.i = N   with   pj ≥ 0  
 
Here, d represents the unknown STE, i is a vector of ones, g is a vector which localizes slices 
in the action plane and N is the total normal force transmitted through the action plane. Under 
some  rearrangements,  equation  (1)  is  solved  by  using  a  modified  simplex  method  [2].  The 
computation allows to obtain STE, load distribution along contact lines and then generalized 
forces  Fk  acting  at  each  center  Ok  of  the  mating  wheels.  Mesh  stiffness  is  also  computed 
considering an increment on the normal force.

2.2 Bearings equilibrium computational method 
Consider the static equilibrium of an elastic shaft supported by two rolling element bearings 
A and B which are mounted in rigid housing. Assume the shaft subjected at a point G to an 
arbitrary generalized  force  vector F which induces generalized reaction force vector at each 
bearing  RA  and  RB.  By  introducing  the  shaft  as  two  linear  FEM  super-elements  with  their 
stiffness matrices assumed to be known, one can obtain [3] the shaft equilibrium equation as 
follows:

xA, xB and xG are respectively the generalized displacement vectors at each point A, B and G. 
Now,  consider  the  equilibrium  of  the  rolling  element  bearing  A.  One  can  obtain  non linear 
relations  between  the  generalized  inner  ring  displacement  xA  and  bearing reaction force RA 
considering non linear forces acting on each rolling element, i.e. Qj = Qj (Tj xA). Here, Tj is a 
simple transformation matrix allowing to precise local displacement of the inner ring relative 
to the outer ring at the rolling element. Bearing reaction force is then given by:

This  non  linear  equation  is  generally  solved  by  a  Newton-Raphson  method.  Further,  if 
necessary, elasticity of the housing can be introduced in the same manner as shaft elasticity. 
To conclude, computation allows to obtain bearing reaction forces, bearing stiffness matrices, 
generalized displacement and then in plane action misalignment φ. 

2.3 Coupled computation 
The STE computation provides the generalized force vector F acting on shafts and function 
of misalignment φ, i.e. F=H(φ). The bearings computation provides misalignment φ from F, 
i.e. φ = g(F). Combining the two procedures leads to:

We  propose  to  solve  equation  (5)  by  using  again  a  Newton-Raphson  procedure.  It  needs 
knowledge  of  the  derivative  h’(φ)  respect  to  φ.  To  this  end,  we  consider  the  composed 
function and evaluate the derivative in two steps from:

All the derivatives have been estimated numerically. The coupling computation does not need 
to modify the original methods. This is the  main advantage  of  the proposed method. In our 
practical applications,  we  have  used a program developed in our research team for the STE 
computation, and a program named SHARC© developed by the company “SNR Roulements” 
for the bearings computation. This last includes shafts and housing elasticity. 

2.4 Vibratory and noise computation 
Methodology  is  described  in  [4-6].  The  vibratory  calculation  is  based  on  a  Finite  Element 
model  including  meshing  and  bearings  stiffnesses.  Dynamic  response  for  each  degree  of 
freedom (in particular d-o-f on the housing) is obtained by using an efficient method named 
Iterative  Spectral  Method  [7].  This  method  allows  to  treat  forced  response  of  parametric 
systems (periodic mesh stiffness). Complex velocity response of the housing constitutes data 
for the acoustical problem which is solved from a boundary element method based on a direct 
integral formulation. Power sound level is directly derived from the calculation. In this paper, 
only a estimated power sound level is given on the assumption of a radiation efficiency equal 
to one. 

3. Results 

3.1 Studied geared system 
In order to exhibit the relevance of the proposed method, we have compared results obtained 
with and without considering coupling effect. Characteristics of the studied geared system are 
given  in  table  1.  The  housing  is  almost  a  parallelepiped  with  one  radiated  noise  face 
(190x120x5 mm).  The  applied  torque  is  60 N.m,  this  corresponds  to  quarter  design  load. 
Manufacturing  errors  and  tooth  surface  modifications  are  introduced  with  characteristics 
given in table 2. Ball bearings with 20° nominal contact angles are chosen in this application. 
Shaft are 32 mm diameter, and 40 mm length. Gears are localized in the middle shaft.

3.2 STE, mesh stiffness, bearing stiffness and shaft misalignment 
Firstly,  we  compare  STE  obtained  by  our  technique  with  those  obtained  by  a  standard 
uncoupled method. Result is given in figure 1.

In  fact,  regarding  the  load  distribution,  adaptation  of  the  misalignment  (induced  in  part  by 
bearings deformations) is taken into account with the coupled method. Consequently, average 
misalignment  is  equal  to  –421 µrad  with  the  coupled  method  instead  of  –110 µrad  which 
affect the load distribution (see figure 2).

As  the  contact  length  is  larger  for  the  coupled  method,  we  obtain  mesh  stiffness  equal  to 
306 N.µm-1 instead of 280 N.µm-1. Also the bearings stiffness matrices are seriously affected 
(see table 3).

instead of  67, 68 and 67 dB with the uncoupled calculation.

4. Conclusion 
In this paper we developed a new method for the calculation of STE that takes into account 
the bearings deformations in a coupling manner. For the chosen gearbox, the interest of this 
method  is  demonstrated.  In  the  short  future  it  will  be  interesting  to  try  different  gearboxes 
system  in  order  to  analyze  in  which  configurations  the  interaction  between  bearing 
deformations and mesh equilibrium is not negligible.

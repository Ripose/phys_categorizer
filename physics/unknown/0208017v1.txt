Abstract

We  study  the  feedback  of  positive  ions  in  triple  and  quadruple  Gas  Electron  Multiplier  (GEM)
detectors.  The  effects  of  GEM  hole  diameter,  detector  gain,  applied  voltages,  number  of  GEMs  and
other parameters on ion feedback are investigated in detail. In particular, it was found that ion feedback
is  independent  of  the  gas  mixture  and  the  pressure.  In  the  optimized  multi-GEM  structure,  the  ion
feedback current can be suppressed down to 0.5% of the anode current, at a drift field of 0.1 kV/cm
and  gain  of  104.  A  simple  model  of  ion  feedback  in  multi-GEM  structures  is  suggested.  The  results
obtained are relevant to the performance of time projection chambers and gas photomultipliers.

1.  Introduction

In  recent  years  there  have  been  considerable
advances in GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier [1])
detectors  in  the  field  of  particle  tracking  [2],
photon  detection  [3,4],  radiation  imaging  [5]
and  high-pressure  detectors  [6].  These  are
based  on  various  physical  effects  taking  place
in multi-GEM structures [7].

One  such  effect  is  the  natural  capability  of
multi-GEM structures to suppress a feedback of
positive  ions  from  an  avalanche  [8,4].  This
the
property  would  allow 
gas
photocathode 

to 
degradation 

suppress 
in 

photomultipliers  (induced  by  ion  impact)  [4]
and  to  prevent  the  field  distortion  in  Time
Projection  Chambers  (TPC)  (induced  by  ion
migration into the drift volume) [9].

The  latter  feature  is  of  primary  importance
for TPC performance at high particle fluxes, in
particular  for  TESLA  TPC  [10].  In  the  ideal
case,  the  ion  charge  migrated  into  the  drift
volume  should  be  of  the  order  of  the  primary
ionization  charge,  i.e.  F~1/G,  where  F  is  the
ion  feedback  fraction  (see  next  section  for  its
definition) and G is the detector gain.

Ion feedback was studied earlier in single and
double  GEM  structures  in  Ar/CO2  [8]  and  in
triple and quadruple GEM structures in Ar/CH4

[4].  It  was  shown  that  it  is  mostly  sensitive  to
the  detector  gain  and  the  drift  field.  Other
parameters,  such  as  the  electric  field  between
GEMs,  the  asymmetry  in  voltages  applied
across  each  GEM  and  the  number  of  GEM
elements had minor effects.

In  this  paper  we  further  study  the  ion
feedback  effects  in  triple  and  quadruple  GEM
structures.  We  study  the  effects  of  the  gas
mixture, pressure, GEM hole diameter, detector
gain  and  other  parameters.  Based  on  the
obtained  results,  the  optimized  multi-GEM
configuration with an  enhanced  suppression  of
ion  feedback  is  proposed.  We  also  consider  a
simple  model  of 
in  GEM
detectors.  A  possible  relation  of  ion  feedback
reduction observed at high gains to the effect of
avalanche  extension  from  the  GEM  holes  is
discussed.

2. Experimental setup and procedures

Three  or  four  GEM  foils  and  a  printed-
circuit-board  (PCB)  anode  were  mounted  in
cascade  inside  a  stainless-steel  vessel  (see
Fig.1).  The  GEMs,  produced  at  CERN
workshop,  have  the  following  characteristics:
50  m m  thick  kapton,  double  conical  holes
arranged  in  a  hexagonal  lattice  with  a  140  m m
pitch,  28· 28  mm2  active  area.  The  GEMs  of
two types were used: with a hole diameter of 85
m m  and  40 
the  metal  side  and
correspondingly  50  m m  and  35  m m  at  the
kapton side (at the centre of the hole).

m m  at 

A  drift  gap  (between  the  cathode  and  the  1st
GEM),  transfer  gaps  (between  the  GEMs)  and
an  induction  gap  (between  the  last  GEM  and
the  anode)  were  3,  1.6  and  1.6  mm,
respectively.  The  detector  was  filled  with
Ar/CH4 
(90/10),  Xe/CH4
(90/10)  or  pure  He.  In  He  it  could  operate  at
pressures  reaching  10  atm; 
in  other  gas
mixtures the operation pressure was 1 atm.

(90/10),  Ar/CF4 

The  detector  was  irradiated  with  an  X-ray
tube  through  a  1  mm  thick  Al  window.  The
GEM electrodes were biased through a resistive

high-voltage  divider,  as  shown  in  Fig.1.  In  He
at  1  atm  typical  electric  fields  were  ET  » 1.1
kV/cm in the transfer gaps and EI » 2 kV/cm in
the  induction  gap;  the  voltage  across  a  single
GEM  (“GEM  voltage”)  was  D VGEM  =150-200
V.  In other mixtures the corresponding values
were  ET  » 2.2  kV/cm,  EI  » 4.4  kV/cm,  D VGEM
=300-400  V.  The  voltage  across  the  drift  gap
was  either  equal  to  that  applied  across  each
GEM, D VD =D VGEM, or constant.

The  anode  signal  was  recorded  in  a  current
mode. The anode current value was always kept
below 100 nA, reducing X-ray tube intensity, to
prevent  charging-up  of  GEMs.  The  detector
gain  was  defined  as  the  anode  current  divided
by the current induced by primary ionization in
the drift gap.  The latter current was determined
in  special  measurements,  where  the  drift  gap
was operated in an ionization mode.

The  ratio  of  the  cathode-to-anode  currents
provides  the  ion  feedback  fraction  to  the
cathode: F=IC / IA . Here a possible contribution
of  the  primary  ionization  current  to  IC  is
neglected,  since  the  ion  feedback  suppression
never  reached  the  ultimate  limit,  i.e.  always
F>>1/G.

It  should  be  remarked  that  the  value  of  ion
feedback fraction in the current work is larger,
by  a  factor  of  2-3,  compared  to  that  of  Refs.
[4,8]  obtained  under  similar  conditions.  In  the
current  work  the  anode  signal  was  read  out
from  the  PCB,  while  in  [4,8]  from  the  bottom
electrode  of  the  last  GEM.  Therefore,  in  the
current work the detected gain is only a fraction
(typically  1/3)  of  the  “real”  gain  due  to
avalanche charge sharing between the PCB and
the  bottom  face  of  the  last  GEM.  Following
Ref.  [4],  these  modes  of  operation,  for  triple
GEM detectors, are designated as 3GEM+PCB
and 3GEM, respectively.

the  charge 

In  particular,  the  electron  and  ion  diffusion,
which is generally a function of the gas and the
pressure,  could  affect 
transfer
through  a  multi-GEM  structure.  It  is  known
however  that  the  GEM  gain  rapidly  decreases
with  pressure  in  gas  mixtures  with  molecular
additives  [11].  On  the  other  hand,  the  high-
pressure operation of multi-GEM detectors has
been recently demonstrated in pure He and Ne
[12]. Therefore we used here pure He to study
the ion feedback dependence on pressure.

Fig.2  shows  gain-voltage  characteristics  of
triple-GEM  detectors  in  He,  at  1  and  10  atm,
and  in  Ar/CH4,  Ar/CF4  and  Xe/CH4,  at  1  atm.
Two GEM hole configurations were used, with
an  equal  hole  diameter,  of  85 m m,  in  all  three
GEMs and with a reduced hole diameter, of 40
m m, in the middle GEM. Here, the designation
“85-40-85  m m”  means  that  the  hole  diameters
are  85,  40  and  85  m m  in  the  1st,  2nd  and  3rd
GEMs, respectively.

One  can  see,  that  for  a  given  voltage  the
effective  (measured)  gain  turned  out  to  be  the
same in both configurations. It was also true for
other  configurations,  having  reduced  holes  in
other  two  GEMs.  This  is  obviously  due  to  the
effect  of  saturation  of 
the  effective  gain
observed in  [8]:  though  the  real  gain  increases
with  decreasing  diameter,  the  effective  gain
remains  saturated,  for  hole  diameters  smaller
than 70 m m, due to decreasing electron transfer
efficiency.

Figs.  3  and  4  illustrate  the  pressure  and  gas
mixture  effects.  Fig.3  shows  the  ion  feedback
fraction  as  a  function  of  the  gain  of  a  triple
GEM detector in He at 1, 5 and 10 atm and in
Ar/CF4  at  1  atm.  The  data  were  obtained  at  a
drift  field  proportional  to  the  field  inside  the
GEM hole (D VD =D VGEM). And Fig.4 shows the
comparison of ion feedback in Ar/CH4, Ar/CF4
and  Xe/CH4  at  a  constant  drift  field:  ED=0.5
kV/cm.

The  results  might  seem  to  be  unexpected.
Indeed,  the  difference  in  operation  voltages
between He and Ar/CF4 is of about a factor of 2
(see Fig.2), while the difference in E/p can even
reach  a  factor  of  10.  Despite  of  this,  the  ion
feedback is practically the same in all gases and
at  all  pressures,  for  a  given  gain.  The

The  effect  of  the  GEM  hole  diameter  is
illustrated  in  Fig.5,  showing  the  ion  feedback
fraction  as  a  function  of  the  gain  of  a  triple
GEM  detector  at  different  GEM  hole
configurations: 85-85-85 m m, 85-40-85 m m, 40-
40-85  m m  and  40-40-40  m m.    Few  statements
can be derived.

First,  there  is  a  substantial  ion  feedback
decrease  when  using  the  middle  GEM  with
reduced  holes.  However,  reducing  holes  in
other  GEMs  results  in  increasing  the  ion
feedback, apparently due to increasing the real
GEM gain as discussed above.

Second,  the  ion  feedback  fraction  is  with
good accuracy an inverse power function of the
gain:

This  is  illustrated  by  the  fact  that  the  data
points  are  fitted  well  by  straight  lines  in  a
double-logarithmic scale.

Third,  the  line  slope  seems  to  be  defined  by
the  GEM  hole  diameter: 
in  particular,
configurations with reduced holes have similar
slopes.

Fourth,  at  gains  higher  than  5· 104  the  given
power dependence is violated: the ion feedback
abruptly  drops  down  (this  is  also  seen  in  fig.3
in Ar/CF4).

As we will see in the following section, first
three  statements  may  be  explained  if  to  adopt
the hypothesis that the ion feedback is induced
mainly by the middle GEM.

The  effect  of  the  drift  field  is  illustrated  in
Figs.6 and 4. The ion feedback turned out to be

3

much  more  sensitive  to  the  drift  field  as
compared  to  other  parameters:  it  increases
almost  linearly  with  it.  One  can  see  that  at  a
gain  of  104  the  ion  feedback  fraction  can  be
suppressed down to 3% and 0.5% at drift fields
of  0.5  and  0.1  kV/cm,  respectively.  These
values correspond to the optimal drift fields in
Ar/CF4  and  Ar/CH4,  respectively,  at  which  the
electron drift velocity has a maximum.

Fig.7  shows  the  effect  of  increasing  the
number  of  GEMs.  It  is  interesting  that  for  the
triple  GEM  hole  configuration  85-85-85  m m,
adding  the  4th  GEM  does  not  decrease  the  ion
feedback.    On  the  other  hand,  there  is  a
substantial  decrease  of  ion  feedback  when
adding  the  GEM  to  the  configuration  with
reduced  holes,  40-40-40  m m.  That  might  mean
that  the  GEM  number  effect  takes  place  only
for  the  GEMs  with  reduced  charge  transfer
efficiency.

fields  and  that  of  the  voltage  of  the  1st  GEM.

Here  a  required  voltage  configuration

Fig.1 (“standard” divider). One can see that the
result  of  varying  the  transfer  field  is  either
negligible, for enhanced transfer fields ET1 and
ET2,  or  negative, 
reduced  ET1.  The
for 
noticeable positive effect is obtained only when
decreasing the 1st GEM voltage, by 25%.

4. Discussion

4.1 A model of ion feedback
Let us try to understand the gain dependence
of ion feedback in multi-GEM structures using
a simplified model. In this model the properties
of  a  GEM  element  are  described  by  a  few
ion  collection
parameters  (see  Fig.9): 
efficiency h  (the fraction of ions collected into
the  GEM  holes  from 
ion
extraction  efficiency  e (the  fraction  of  ions
extracted from the GEM holes into the gap) and
the effective (“visible”) GEM gain g as seen by
the following GEM or PCB element. The latter
parameter is in fact the product of the electron

the  gap), 

the

collection  efficiency  into  the  holes,  the  real
gain (amplification factor) of the GEM and the
electron  extraction  efficiency  from  the  holes

the gain, i.e. they are fully defined by the GEM
hole geometry and electric fields in the adjacent
gaps.

To  reduce  the  number  of  parameters,  we
consider  here  a 
simplified  3GEM+PCB
configuration,  often  used  in  practice:  with
symmetrical  double-conical  holes  and  with
transfer  and  induction  fields  equal  to  each
other,  but  the  drift  field  being  different  from
them.  The  appropriate  notations  are  presented
in Fig.9.

hole  configurations,  is  induced  mainly  by  the
last GEM element.

We  cannot  extract

We  however  can  evaluate  a  contribution  of
each  GEM  to  ion  feedback.  Fig.11  shows  a
comparison  of  the  model  to  experimental  data
for  GEM  structures  with  reduced  holes.  One
can  see  that  the  inverse  power  dependence  on
gain,  revealed  in  the  previous  section,  is  well

reproduced by the model. The matter is that the
major contribution to ion feedback  is  provided
now by the middle GEM element, giving rise to
G-1/3 dependence. This is because the  real  gain
of  the  middle  GEM,  and  consequently  its  ion
current,  is  higher  and  its  transparency  for  ions
arrived from the 3rd GEM is lower as compared
to  other  GEM  elements.  Note  that  the  ion
feedback  current  of  the  1st  GEM  can  be
neglected (see the parameter values in Fig.11).

might be connected to the avalanche extension
outside  the  GEM  holes,  which  also  has  the
threshold in gain [3,13]. Indeed, if it would be
the case, the positive ions produced outside the
hole  would  have  more  chances  to  drift  to  the
bottom GEM electrode rather than to enter the
hole.  It  is  interesting  that  the  critical  gain  at
which  the  supposed  avalanche  extension  takes
place here is of the same order as that estimated

We have studied the feedback of positive ions

some
dependence  of 
parameters was investigated in detail. These are
the gas mixture, pressure, GEM hole diameter,
detector gain, drift field, transfer field, 1st GEM
voltage  and  number  of  GEMs.  The  principal

(3) The ion feedback decreases with gain. In a
wide  gain  range,  it  can  be  described  by  an
inverse  power  function  of  the  gain.  It  is  also
rather  sensitive  to  the  GEM  hole  diameter.
Other parameters, such as the transfer field and
the number of GEMs, have minor effect.

suppression  of  ion  feedback  is  a  triple  GEM
structure  with  a  reduced  hole  diameter  of  the
middle  GEM  and  reduced  1st  GEM  voltage.  In
this configuration the ion feedback, at a gain of
104, can be suppressed down to 0.5% at a drift
field of 0.1 kV/cm and 3% at a drift field of 0.5
kV/cm. We think that this is the best that can be

Fig.1 A schematic view of a triple GEM detector with the
appropriate notations.

Fig.3  Effect  of  the  pressure  and  the  gas  mixture.  Ion
feedback fraction as a function of the gain of a triple GEM
detector  at  different  pressures  and  in  different  gases,  at
D VD =D VGEM.
 

Fig.2  Gain  of  triple  GEM  detectors  at  different  pressures
in He [12] and in different gases at 1 atm as a function of
the  voltage  across  each  GEM.  Two  GEM  hole
configurations were used: 85-85-85 m m (filled points) and
85-40-85 m m (open points).

 

Fig.4 Effect of the gas mixture. Ion feedback fraction as a
function of the gain of a triple GEM detector in different
gases (at 1 atm), at a constant drift field ED=0.5 kV/cm. In
Ar/CH4, the effect of reducing the drift field, down to 0.1
kV/cm, is demonstrated.

Fig.5  Effect  of  the  GEM  hole  diameter.  Ion  feedback
fraction as a function of the gain of a triple GEM detector
at different GEM hole configurations.
 

 

Fig.7  Effect  of  increasing  the  number  of  GEMs.  Ion
feedback  fraction  as  a  function  of  the  drift  field  in  triple
and quadruple GEM detectors at a gain of 104, at different
GEM hole configurations.

 

 

Fig.6  Effect  of  the  drift  field.  Ion  feedback  fraction  as  a
function of the drift field at a gain of 104 of a triple GEM
detector,  at 
two  GEM  hole  configurations.  The
configuration  with  decreased  1st  GEM  voltage  is  also
shown.
 

Fig.8 Effects of the transfer field and the 1st GEM voltage.
Ion feedback fraction as a function of the gain of a triple
GEM  detector  at  different  voltage  configurations.
Standard configuration corresponds to the voltage divider
shown in Fig.1.

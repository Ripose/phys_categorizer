Deduction of the speed of light in any frame of reference.

Abstract

We begin by admitting the following:

There is a frame of reference where the speed of light is the same in any direction – that
speed is c.
The average speed of light on a two-way journey is c in every frame of reference.

From this two premises we obtain an expression for the speed of light which implies the
speed  of  light  depends  on  the  motion  of  the  frame  of  reference.  Also  from  this  two
premises solely we deduct Lorentz Transformation.

Introduction

Experience  suggests  that,  when  a  ray  of  light  is  emitted  towards  a  mirror  and  then
reflected back to its point of origin, its average speed (the total distance divided by the
total time) for the two-way journey is c in every frame of reference. We’ll assume this is
in  fact so. Also we’ll  assume the existence of a  frame of reference where the speed of
light has the value c in every direction – we will assume light always moves with speed
c on this frame independently of the state of motion of the emitting body1.

Obviously if the speed of light is c in every direction in a given frame of reference, then
the two-way average speed will also be c in that frame. Yet, the two-way average speed
being c  in a given  frame, doesn’t imply  light travels with speed c  on  both  parts of  the
journey in that frame. So, while we assume the two-way average speed of  light is c  in
every frame, only for one frame do we assume the true speed of light is c – we call this
the resting frame.

The  speed  of  light  being  c  in  every  direction  in  the  resting  frame  means  that  if  we
simultaneously  emit  two  rays  of  light  in  opposite  directions  they  will  travel  the  same
distance in the same time in this frame. So, if we place two clocks at any two points at
the same distance from the origin of the rays of light and if each ray of light is emitted
towards a clock, then we can  be sure the rays will reach  the  clocks  simultaneously.  In
other words, we can safely use Einstein’s method of synchronization [1] to synchronize
all the clocks fixed on this frame of reference. On the other hand, for all frames except
the  resting  one,  we’re  not  sure  what  the  speed  of  light  on  a  one-way  journey  is.

                                                       
1 Notice that while the speed of light may be independent of the state of motion of the emitting body, its
value doesn’t have to be c in every frame of reference. We assume the speed of light must have constant
value for every frame, but that value may change from one frame to other.

Therefore  by  using  Einstein’s  method  of  synchronization,  we  can’t  be  sure  to
synchronize the clocks of any frame except the resting one.

We’ll  next  show  that  our  premises  are  not  only  sufficient  in  order  to  obtain  Lorentz
Transformation,  but  also  that  they  are  inconsistent  with  the  stronger  premise  that  the
speed of light is the same in every frame of reference [2].

 Lorentz Transformation obtained from absolute motion

Suppose  the  existence  of  a  frame  of  reference  S  where  the  speed  of  light  is  c  in  any
direction. Consider also a second frame of reference S' moving with velocity v related to
S – for simplicity’s sake S’ only moves along the x-axis.  We  impose y=y' and z=z'  for
every t (since they are perpendicular to the motion of S’, the y’-axis and the z’-axis do
not  contract).  We’ll  suppose  the  clocks  of  S  are  already  synchronized  between  each
other by Einstein’s method – we can assume this, since we know the speed of light in S
is c in any direction. We’ll suppose that when the clocks of S  mark the instant t=0, all
the clocks of S' fixed at x'=0 also mark the  instant t'= 0. We’ll also assume that when
t=0 the origin of S' coincides with the origin of S.

Now, suppose that by the moment the origin of S' passes on the origin of S (at t=0), a
ray of light is emitted from that point along the positive direction of the y'-axis. Since S'
is only moving along the x-axis and this ray of light moves along the y'-axis and because
we  admit  the  two-way  speed  is  always  c,  then  we  can  conclude  by  symmetry  that  the
one-way speed of this particular ray of light is also c in S'  2. Yet we admit the one-way
speed of the ray of light is also c in S, so we must conclude the clocks of S' are running
slower. When we relate the movement of the ray of light in both frames of reference, we
obtain the following relations between t and t´:

2 This conclusion can be briefly explained by the following: Suppose the ray of light was reflected by a
mirror fixed anywhere on the y’-axis - the ray would return to the origin. Since the ray moves parallel to
the y’-axis, if we look at that two-way journey from the point of view of S, we will conclude both parts of
the journey have the same distance in S. This means both parts of the journey take the same time to be
completed in S since light always moves with speed c in this frame. But if this is so, then while it might
take longer to complete each part of the journey in S’ then in S, the time of both parts must also be the
same in S’ and so must the speed of light. Since the average speed of the total journey is c, each one-way
journey must also be c. Of course this conclusion is only true because the light is moving parallel to the
y’-axis.

Suppose that,  also  at  t=0,  a  second  ray  of  light  is  emitted  from  the  coinciding  origins
towards a mirror fixed on the x’-axis on the point (x'=x', y '=0, z' =0). Since the speed of
light is c  in S and the velocity of S'  is v  in  S,  we  have  the  following  equations  for the
position of the ray of light (3) and the mirror (4) in the frame of reference S:

From  (3)  and  (4)  we  obtain  the  time  t1  required  for  the  light  to  travel  from  the
coinciding origins to the mirror:

We can, from a similar analysis, determine the time t2 needed for the light to travel back
from the mirror to the origin of S'. That time is:

From (5) and (6) we have the total time of the two-way journey:

Suppose  the  first  ray  of  light,  emitted  along  the  y'-axis,  is  also  reflected  by  a  mirror
fixed  on  this  axis  at  the  same  distance  from  the  origin  (x'=0,  y'  =x',  z'=0).  Since  the
speed of this ray  is c, if t'  is the time the  light takes to reach the  mirror on the y'-axis,
then t' is also the time for the light to return to the origin. Since the total distance of each
two-way  journey of  the  two rays  of  light  is  the  same  in  S'  and  since  the  average  two-
way  speed  of  both  rays  of  light  is  c,  then  the  two  rays  of  light  take  the  same  time  to
complete the journey. We have the following relation:

From (12) we see that the distance of the mirror fixed on the x'-axis from the coinciding
origins  is  larger  if  measured  in  S'  then  it  is  in  S.  We  conclude  that  the  x'-axis  is
contracted.

Since we know the relation between the time of S and S' (2) we can immediately obtain
the time the light takes to reach the mirror fixed on the x'-axis (13) and the time the light
takes to return to the origin of S' (14). From (2), (5) and (6) we have:

Conclusion

We’ve shown that while the average speed of  light on a two-way  journey  may  be  c  in
every frame of reference, the speed of light changes accordingly to the absolute motion
of the frame it is measured in. The speed of light can only be constant in a single frame
of reference. This implies absolute rest. We’ve also shown that the existence of absolute
rest,  doesn’t  imply  Lorentz  transformation  is  not  true.  We’ve  derived  Lorentz
transformation from the same premises that lead us to the conclusion that the speed of
light is not a constant. This shows Lorentz Transformation can and  must be physically
interpreted in the context of absolute motion [2].

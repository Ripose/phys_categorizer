Very recently we present a theory to discuss the nature of light and show that the quantization 
of light energy in vacuum can be derived directly from classical electromagnetic theory. In the 
theory  a  key  concept  of  stability  of  statistical  distribution  and  a  variational  procedure 
searching  for  those  of  relatively  stable  statistical  distributions  were  introduced.  This  is  a 
classical  interpretation  to  the  concept  and  method  concerned.  It  would  be  helpful  for 
avoiding  some  of  possible  obsession  from  the  variational  procedure  and  its  final  quantum 
result.   
 
Keywords: the nature of light, classical interpretation, relatively stable statistical distributions 
 
Very recently we present a theory [1] to show that the quantization of light energy in vacuum 
can  be  derived  directly  from  classical  electromagnetic  theory  through  the  consideration  of 
statistics based on classical physics and reveal that the quantization of energy is an intrinsic 
property  of  light  as  a  classical  electromagnetic  wave  and  has  no  need  of  being  related  to 
particles. Here is an interpretation to the theory, which would be helpful for understanding 
the concept and method concerned and avoiding some of obsession possible. 
      Suppose 
oscillator  (ODHO), 

be  the  density  function  of  the  generalized  coordinate  of  1-D  harmonic 
,  to  be  found,  then  we  can  always  introduce  such  a  complex-valued 

)(qρ

q

function 

)(qψ   mathematically  that  makes

.  The

These  are  understandable  ones  in  classical  physics:  Eq.(1)  is  the  general  condition  for  any 
density function; Eq.(2) ensures the amplitude of each ODHO being finite; and Eq.(3) is the 
finiteness  condition  of  the  expectation  value, 
,  of  the  ODHO’s  energy.  One  can  see  that 
those  meeting  these  conditions  make  up  of  the  whole  of  the  function  candidates  used  to 
)(qρ
construct 
  and  the  number  of  them  is  infinite.  To  search  for  those  of  relatively  stable 
statistical  distributions  of 
,  in  Ref.[1]  we  changed  Eqs.(1)-(3)  into  a  set  of  equivalent

“equilibrium  conditions”(EECs)[1]  (see  below);  introduced  a  correlative  functional  and  then 
performed the variation. To make the concept and method mentioned easily understood and 
show they to be of the classical, let us draw an analogy as follows:

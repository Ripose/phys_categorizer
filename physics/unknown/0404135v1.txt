   Phase-stabilized 12-fs, 1-nJ pulses from a commercial Ti:Sapphire oscillator are

directly  amplified  in  a  chirped  pulse  optical  parametric  amplifier  (CPOPA)  and

recompressed  to  yield  near-transform-limited  17.3-fs  pulses.  The  amplification

process is demonstrated to be phase preserving and leads to 85-µJ, carrier-envelope-

offset (CEO) phase-locked pulses at 1 kHz for 0.9  mJ of pump, corresponding to a

single-pass gain of 8.5 × 104.  © 2004 Optical Society of America

Chirped-pulse optical parametric amplification (CPOPA) [1-3] is rapidly emerging as

an  attractive  alternative  to  conventional  stimulated  emission-based  chirped  pulse

amplifier (CPA) systems for the amplification of ultrashort pulses. Large single-pass

parametric gains, on the order of 107, are in principle possible by propagation through

only  millimeters  of  material,  yielding  substantially  reduced  B  integrals;  the  gain

bandwidth  can  be  tailored  by  choice  of  nonlinear  optical  crystal  and  interaction

geometry, with bandwidths in excess of 180 THz (6000 cm–1) previously reported [4];

and  since  only  transitions  between  virtual  states  are  involved,  there  is  no  energy

storage and thermal loading is virtually eliminated, which is advantageous for high

repetition rate applications. The major limitation to CPOPA has been the availability

of pump sources capable of delivering sufficiently short, high-energy pulses. Even so,

with  existing  technology  two  extreme  features  have  been  demonstrated:  multi-

terawatt-level  amplification  with  a  long  pulse,  low-repetition  rate,  Nd:glass  laser

[5,6], and ultrabroadband amplification to yield sub-5-fs pulses at the few-microjoule

level  from  a  white-light  seed  [4,7,8].  Here,  we  choose  a  picosecond  pump  source

since it represents an ideal compromise between pulses short enough to allow for bulk

stretching  and  prism  compression  of  the  seed  [9],  avoiding  the  potentially  phase-

disturbing influences of diffraction gratings [10]; but sufficiently long to alleviate the

need for precise pulse-front matching, necessary with femtosecond pump pulses to

permit accurate recompression without spatial chirp [8]. In theory, the phase of the

amplified seed remains, aside from quantum noise, unaltered by amplification with a

non-stabilized  pump  since  the  idler  field  dissipates  the  phase  offset.  This  makes

CPOPA eminently suitable for applications such as high-harmonic generation with

few-cycle  pulses  in  which  the  carrier–envelope  offset  (CEO)  phase  [11,12]  is  of

paramount importance. Experimental verification of the phase preservation in CPOPA

has, to our knowledge, not been previously reported.

In this letter, we demonstrate the phase preservation of CPOPA by directly amplifying

the  output  of  a  phase-stabilized  oscillator,  using  the  experimental  configuration

schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Traditional short-pulse OPA/CPOPA systems are

seeded by white-light continua at the so-called "magic" visible-wavelength broadband

phase  matching  angle  in  BBO  [13],  but  would  require  arduous  phase-stabilization

schemes  for  the  white-light  pump  to  benefit  from  the  phase  preservation  in  the

CPOPA process. Direct amplification of Ti:Sapphire oscillator pulses has previously

been demonstrated with pumping by nanosecond pulses, and recompression to 310 fs

has been reported [14].

As  a  seed  laser,  we  used  a  CEO-phase-stabilized  (Menlo  Systems),  commercial

Ti:Sapphire  oscillator  (Femtolasers),  that  delivered  700  mW  of  12-fs  pulses  at  a

repetition rate of 76 MHz. The oscillator phase stabilization feedback system required

175  mW  of  the  output  power;  and  350  mW  were  directed  to  the  regenerative

amplifier. Seed pulses were selected at a 1 kHz repetition frequency, stretched in a

DAZZLER  (FastLite),  amplified  in  the  CPOPA,  and  recompressed  in  a  prism

compressor.

The  CPOPA  was  pumped  by  the  frequency-doubled  output  from  a  modified

commercial  Ti:Sapphire  regenerative  amplifier  system  (Spitfire,  Positive  Light).

Seeding  the  Spitfire  with  part  of  the  output  from  the  oscillator  ensured

synchronization between pump and seed pulses in the CPOPA. The Spitfire produced

2.5-mJ pulses with a duration of 4.3 ps (FWHM). The pulses were frequency-doubled

in  a  2-mm  thick  BBO  crystal,  cut  for  type-I  second-harmonic generation (SHG) at

800  nm,  with  a  conversion  efficiency  of  40%.  The  resulting  400-nm  pump  pulses

were focused by a 1-m radius of curvature focusing mirror into the CPOPA crystal (3-

mm-long BBO crystal cut at θ = 29.2°) to yield a pump intensity of 65 GW/cm2.

The  DAZZLER  was  used  as  the  pulse  stretcher  for  the  CPOPA  seed,  and

simultaneously allowed for higher-order dispersion correction during the optimization

of the pulse compression. The stretched 1-nJ seed pulses were loosely focused into

the CPOPA crystal using a 1-m focal length lens.  The pump and seed beams were

overlapped  in  the  CPOPA  crystal  with  a noncollinear  angle  of α  =  2.1°  for  near-

degenerate OPA, for which the gain bandwidth exceeded 70 THz.  For a pump energy

of 0.9 mJ, the 1-nJ seed was amplified to 85 µJ, corresponding to a single pass gain of

8.5×104. The solid line in Fig. 2(a)  shows the measured amplified spectrum, which

supported  a  theoretical  transform-limited  pulse  duration  of  17.2  fs.  After

amplification, the pulses are recompressed in  a  double-prism compressor, designed

using numerical and ray-tracing simulations [9]. The compressor exhibited some 10%

transmission losses, reducing the energy available in the compressed pulses to 77 µJ.

The compressed pulses were characterized by SPIDER [15,16], and the reconstructed

spectral  phase  variations  were  minimized  using  the  incident  phase  adjustment

provided by the DAZZLER. The optimized phase is shown by the dashed line in Fig.

2(a); it exhibited phase variations of less than ±π/4 across the whole spectral range.

The reconstructed, near-transform-limited (17.3±0.2)-fs temporal pulse shape for the

optimized pulse is shown in Fig. 2(b).  The transverse intensity profile was recorded

with a high resolution CCD (DataRay) and is shown  by  the  inset  in  Fig.  2(b).  We

anticipate that the CPOPA output will soon be suitable even for high-field physics

experiments.

In  order  to  verify  the  phase  preservation  in  our  configuration  of  CPOPA,  we

measured the beat signal between the high frequency part of a white-light spectrum,

generated  in  a  1-mm  thick  sapphire  plate,  and  the  low  frequency  components

frequency-doubled  in  a  250-µm  thick  BBO  crystal  [17].  The  CEO  phase  of  the

amplified  pulses  could  be  derived  from  the  spectral  location  of  the  interference

fringes, which were recorded with either of two spectrometers equipped with linear

CCD arrays (USB2000, Ocean Optics; SpectraPro 300i, Acton Research). Figure 3(a)

shows  the  temporal  evolution  of  interference  spectra  recorded  over  15,000

consecutive pulses. With the phase stabilization to the oscillator switched off (Fig.

3(a),  top),  averaging  over 30  pulses  due  to  the  integration  time  of  the  CCD  array

smears out the interference since successive pulses have random relative CEO phases,

and no fringes are visible. By contrast, the interference fringes for the CEO-phase-

stabilized  oscillator  (bottom)  are  resolved  and  stationary,  apart  from  fluctuations

introduced by air currents and mechanical vibrations. To our knowledge, this is the

first experimental verification of CEO phase preservation in a CPOPA process. The

CEO interference fringes for the phase-stabilized CPOPA were observed to remain

resolved and stationary over 10,000 pulses, as shown by the solid line in the time-

integrated plot of Fig. 3(b), whereas after integration over the same time period for

the unstabilized oscillator, shown by the dashed line, manifested no resolved fringes.

In  conclusion,  we  have  demonstrated  direct  amplification  of  1-nJ  phase-stabilized

oscillator pulses to a pulse energy of 85 µJ for a 0.9-mJ pump, and recompressed the

amplified  pulses  to  a  near-transform  limited  pulse  duration  of  17.3  using  the

DAZZLER.  The  output  energy  could  be  increased  directly  by  multi-passing  the

CPOPA  crystal  [8], while numerical modeling predicts further energy scaling with

larger  beam  sizes.  Measurements  of  the  CEO  phase  of  the  amplified  pulses

demonstrates that the CPOPA process preserves the seed phase.

Abstract 

We  have  observed  the  interference  of  optical  diffraction  radiation  (ODR)  and  optical 

transition  radiation  (OTR)  produced  by  the  interaction  of  a  relativistic  electron  beam  with  a 

micromesh  foil  and  a  mirror.    The  production  of  forward  directed  ODR  from  electrons  passing 

through the holes and wires of the mesh and their separate interactions with backward OTR from 

the mirror are analyzed with the help of a simulation code. By careful choice of the micromesh 

properties, mesh-mirror spacing, observation wavelength and filter band pass, the interference of 

the ODR produced from the unperturbed electrons passing through the open spaces of the mesh 

and OTR from the mirror are observable above a broad incoherent background from interaction 

of the heavily scattered electrons passing through the mesh wires.  These interferences (ODTRI) 

are  sensitive  to  the  beam  divergence  and  can  be  used  to  directly  diagnose  this  parameter.  We 

compare experimental divergence values obtained using ODTRI, conventional OTRI, for the case 

when  front  foil  scattering  is  negligible,  and  computed  values  obtained  from  transport  code 

calculations and multiple screen beam size measurements. We obtain good agreement in all cases.  

Introduction 

 

 

 

The  term  ‘diffraction  radiation’  is  commonly  used  to  describe  the  radiation 

produced when a charged particle moving at a constant velocity passes near, but does not 

intercept,  a  material  whose  dielectric  constant  differs  from  the  medium  in  which  the 

particle  is  traveling  [1].  This  radiation  is  caused  by  a  rapid  change  in  the  induced 

polarization  of  the  impacted  medium  caused  by  the  transiting  particle.  It  is  the 

polarization  current  that  radiates.  The  radiation  can  be  observed  in  the  far  field 

(Fraunhofer zone) or the near field (wave or Fresnel zone). The far field spectral-angular 

properties of DR are similar to those of transition radiation (TR), which is produced by a 

charge  particle  passing  through  a  solid  boundary  between  two  media  with  different 

dielectric  constants,  but  has  some  distinguishing  features  [2].    Like  TR,  the  spectral-

angular distribution of DR is altered by the angular distribution of the beam particles and 

thus  it  can  be  used  to  diagnose  the  beam’s  divergence  and  mean  trajectory  angle. 

However,  unlike  TR,  the  spectral-angular  distribution  of  DR  is  also  a  function  of  the 

beam  size  and  its  intensity  is  a  function  of  the  proximity  of  the  charged  particle  to  the 

impacted medium.  

The  relevant  parameter  which  governs  the  intensity  of  DR  produced  is  the  so-

called radiation impact parameter, a = γλ/2π; here γ is the Lorentz factor of the moving 

charge and λ is the observed wavelength. The parameter a is a measure of the degree of 

fall-off  of  the  radial  component  of  electric  field  of  the  moving  particle  [3].  Significant 

DR  is  produced  when  a l≤ ,  the  distance  of  closest  approach  of  the  particle  to  the 

impacted  medium,  e.g.  the  edges  of  circular  aperture  or  slit  through  which  the  beam 

traveling  in  a  vacuum  passes.  The  radiation  impact  parameter  is  also  relevant  to  the 

production  of  transition  radiation,  since  when  a

r≥ ,  the  size  of  the  radiating  medium, 

diffraction  effects  from  the  edges  of  the  radiator  are  significant  [4,5].  These  effects 

include cutoffs in the spectral density at low frequency for a finite size solid radiator and 

at  high  frequency  for  an  aperture,  as  well  as  modulations  (fringes)  in  the  angular 

distribution of the radiation.  

TR  from  a  finite  size  screen  and  DR  from  an  aperture  are  closely  related 

complementary effects. In fact, Babinet’s principle applies to the radiation fields; i.e. TR 

from a finite size radiator is equal to the difference of TR from an infinite plane and DR 

from a complementary aperture [6-8].  In this sense there is no formal distinction between 

the two radiation phenomena and we will refer to both TR from a finite size screen and 

DR from an aperture as diffraction radiation,  when the relevant size of the radiator or 

aperture  is  less  than  or  of  the  order  of  the  radiation  impact  parameter.  Our  interest  in 

this  paper  is  the  investigation  of  incoherent  (λ <<  beam  dimensions),  far  field,  optical 

(λ =  400-700  nm)  diffraction  radiation  (ODR)  from  beams  with  moderate  energies  (i.e. 

10- 100 MeV), where the radiation impact parameter a is in the range 10-100 μm.

Theoretical investigations have shown that the far field angular distribution (AD) 

of  ODR  can  be  used  as  a  non-interceptive  beam  size  and  divergence  diagnostic  for 

relativistic beams [6,9,10].  Experiments have verified that the far field AD from a single 

screen can be used to measure the beam size for a low divergence beam [11].  ‘Near field 

imaging’,  a  term  which  is  somewhat  loosely  used  to  describe  imaging  the  spatial 

distribution  of  DR  at  the  source  to  elicit  information  about  beam  position  and  size  has 

also  been  investigated  theoretically  [12,13].    Recently  an  experimental  study  of  ‘near 

field imaging’ of ODR from a single metal edge has been reported [14].  

In  an  earlier  study  [7]  we  showed  computationally  how  optical  diffraction-

transition radiation interferometry (ODTRI) could be used to measure the divergence of  

moderate energy (10-100 MeV) electron beams. This technique uses a device similar to a 

conventional two foil OTR interferometer [15]. However, in an ODTR interferometer the 

first  foil  is  replaced  by  a  micromesh  [16]  whose  cell  dimensions  are  comparable  to  the 

radiation  impact  parameter  for  visible  wavelengths  but  much  smaller  than  the  beam 

radius (100’s to 1000’s of microns).  

A  general  schematic  of  a  reflection  ODTR  interferometer  is  shown  in  Figure  1. 

The  diagram  shows  the  production  of  ODR  from  unscattered  (u)  electrons  passing 

through  the  holes  of  the  micromesh  and  ODR  from  scattered  (s)  electrons  passing 

through  the  wires  of  the  mesh.  These  forward  directed  ODR  components  reflect  and 

interfere with backward OTR generated by the beam impinging on the mirror itself. 

 While  both  ODR  components  from  the  mesh  are  due  to  a  changing  induced 

polarization current on the metal in wires we can consider them to be independent effects. 

The  total  ODR  intensity  from  unperturbed  electrons  passing  through  the  holes  is 

comparable  to  that  produced  by  electrons  passing  through  the  wires  when  the 

transparency  of  the  mesh  is  about  50%  [7].  However,  by  properly  choosing  the  atomic 

number and thickness of the mesh material one can take advantage of electron scattering 

in  the  wires  to  wash  out  the  interference  of  ODR  from  the  scattered  component  and 

backward OTR from the mirror produced by this component. The scattered contribution 

to the observed radiation pattern then forms a smooth background and by proper choice 

of the optical band  pass,  the  fringes  from  the ODR  from unperturbed electrons passing 

 

3

through  the  holes  can  be  made  visible  above  this  background.  The  visibility  of  these 

fringes is sensitive to the unperturbed beam divergence.

In [17] we presented preliminary results of an rms beam divergence measurement 

made using ODTRI. In this paper we present detailed results, analysis and comparisons 

of  divergences  obtained  using  three  different  techniques:  ODTRI,  OTRI  and  multiple 

screens-transport  code  calculations.  We  report  measurements  of  both  vertical  and 

horizontal components of the divergence on two different electron beam accelerators with 

beam  energies  50  and  100  MeV,  respectively.  We  also  present  a  more  detailed 

explanation  of  the  model  employed  in  the  simulation  code  we  have  developed  to 

calculate  ODTRI  than  previously  given  in  ref.  [17].  We  also  provide  a  detailed 

explanation  of  how  we  use  the  simulation  code  results  to  fit  the  data.    The  excellent 

agreement between all these measurements and calculations firmly establishes ODTRI as 

a  viable  new  technique  for  the  measurement  of  beam  divergence  for  moderate  energy 

relativistic  electron  beams.  In  addition,  ODTRI  has  a  distinct  advantage  over 

conventional OTR interferometry, which is subject to the limitation that only divergences 

comparable to or exceeding the rms scattering angle in the primary foil can be measured; 

no such limitation is present with ODTRI.

Background 

 
OTR Interferometry 
 

The performance of a conventional OTR two-foil interferometer can be evaluated 

from  the  expression  for  the  far  field  spectral-angular  distribution  of  backward  reflected 

radiation observed in the detection plane. This plane is perpendicular to the direction of 

specular  reflection  (for  backward  reflected  radiation)  or  to  the  direction  of  the  average 

beam  velocity  (for  forward  radiation).  While  in  reality  the  radiation  expands  as  a 

spherical wave in the far field, measurement of the radiation in the detection plane, which 

is  tangent  to  the  spherical  wave  front,  is  a  good  approximation  for  small  angles  of 

observation measured from the tangent point, i.e. z = 0.

 is the coherence or ‘formation length’, defined as 

the  distance  over  which  the  field  of  the  electron  and  the  co-moving  radiation  photon 

differ in phase by 1 radian. 

 For all inter foil distances the radiation from two foils will interfere.  However,  

the  number  of  interferences  per  angular  interval  increases  as  the  interfoil  spacing  and 

angle  of  observation  increase.  The  visibility  of  these  interferences  is  a  function  of  the 

divergence  and  energy  spread  of  the  beam  which  typically  are  fractions  of  1/γ for  high 

quality beams.  However, we have shown [21] that if the energy spread is smaller than 

the  normalized  divergence  of  the  beam  (i.e.  ΔE/E  <<  γσ),  which  is  the  case  for  our 

experimental  conditions  for  all  angles,  the  divergence  effect  dominates  and  hence  the 

fringe  visibility  becomes  a  diagnostic  for  this  quantity.    The  sensitivity  of  the 

interferometer  to  a  given  range  of  divergence  can  be  optimized  by  adjustment  of  the 

interfoil spacing and the band pass of the measurement.   

Description of Simulation Code used to Calculate ODR and ODTRI 

In a conventional OTR interferometer forward OTR from a solid foil reflects and 

interferes with backward OTR from the mirror, where both the forward TR from the first 

foil and the backward TR from the mirror each has the form given above in Eqs. (2,3,5).  

However,  when  the  first  foil  is  a  mesh,  the  radiation  is  ODR  from  two  distinguishable 

sources:  1)  the  beam  electrons  passing  through  the  holes  of  the  mesh  and  2)  the  beam 

electrons  passing  through  the  solid  wires  separating  the  holes.  Each  of  these  ODR 

components  interferes  with  two  corresponding  OTR  components  generated  from  the 

unscattered  and  scattered  beam  electrons  emerging  from  the  mesh  interacting  with  the

mirror.  Thus  the  total  intensity  observed  is  composed  of  four  contributions,  two  ODR 

components from the mesh and two corresponding OTR components from the mirror. 

 Analytic expressions for 

 from the mesh similar to 

 given above in Eqs.

(2,3) are not available. Hence we have developed a simulation code to calculate them. In 

addition  our  code  computes  the  angular  convolution  of  these  components  with  a  two 

dimension distribution of beam trajectory angles represented by one or more 2D Gaussian 

distributions  each  with  a  width  representing 

,x yσ ,  the  rms  x  and  y  divergences  of  the 

corresponding beam component.  For OTRI such a convolution can be directly applied to 

the  analytic  forms  for  the  OTR  intensities  components  given  above  by  Eqs.  (2,3).  For 

ODTRI  the  convolutions  are  incorporated  into  the  ODR  simulation  code.  The  latter 

simulation code results should agree in the OTRI calculations in the limit of zero mesh 

cell size (i.e. continuous foil limit).  We have use this limit as well as other checks [see 

ref. 7] to establish the validity of the simulation code. 

 

Calculation of DR and TR from the two foils of the interferometer  

Our  simulation  code  calculates  the  angular  distribution  of  the  intensity  of  ODR 

produced by an electron beam passing through two parallel foils which are separated by 

the  distance  d  measured  along  the  direction  of  the  beam  velocity.    In  the  analysis  and 
experiments described in this paper the foils are tilted by an angle ν = 45O.  In the code 

we  neglect  the  longitudinal  component  of  the  electric  field  of  the  electron.  This 

simplifying approximation is valid for high energies (E > 50 MeV) even if the foils are 

tilted with respect to the electron beam velocity. We assume that the mesh perforations 

are  perfectly  symmetric  rectangular  holes  with  width  h  ,  which  are  evenly  and 

symmetrically  distributed  on  the  foil  with  period  p.  The  foil  structure  is  represented  as 

sum  of  translations  of  the  unit  cell  shown  in  Figure  3.,  which  shows  a  portion  of  the 

perforated foil projected onto a plane normal to the mean beam velocity. We refer to this 

plane as the source plane.  The perforations are shown as white rectangles and a single 

perforation  and  its  surrounding  solid  area  (unit  cell)  is  shown  as  two  concentric 

rectangles.  Radiation  from  the  first  and  second  foils  is  calculated  assuming  that  the 

forward and backward radiations are symmetric about the surface of the tilted foil.   If the 

 

 

8

size of the foil is large and the beam cross section is much larger than the period of the 

perforations p, the beam density profile varies very slowly over the cell period p and is 

considered to be constant over each cell.   

For computational purposes, the beam passing through the perforated foil is split 

into two fractions: one fraction composed of electrons passing the solid part of foil cell 

(i.e.  a  scattered  component  )    shown  in  dark  grey  in  Figure  3.,  the  other  composed  of 

unscattered electrons passing through the holes shown as the lighter grey rectangle.  The 

beam’s spatial distribution is modeled as a large number of macro particles (N ~ 1000-

2000) which are homogeneously distributed within the cell.    The number of  unscattered 

particles      NU  =  N  ·  T,  where  T  is  the  foil  transparency    and  the  number  of    scattered 

electrons NS = N – NU .

Calculation of ODR Intensities for a single particle within cell of the mesh 

For simplicity, the formulas presented  below  describe forward directed radiation 

from both foils of the interferometer considering the z axis to be directed forward and the 

detection  plane  is  normal  to  this  axis.    There  is  no  loss  of  generality  in  this  approach 

because forward and backward specularly reflected radiations are mirror symmetric.

The  horizontal  observation  plane  is  defined  to  be  coplanar  to  (x, z );  the  vertical

      Now  consider  an  electron  which  is  incident  on  or  emerges  from  the  surface  of 

perfect  conductor.    Inside  the  conductor  the  total  field  equals  zero  because  the  perfect 

conductor  “screens  out”  all  fields.  This  means  that  the  conductor  can  be  modeled  as  a 

region where, in addition to the fields of the electron, there are “primary induced” electric 

Ei  and magnetic Bi fields with amplitudes equal and opposite in sign to the fields of the 

electron, i.e.  Ei ≡ -Ee   and Bi ≡ -Be at all points in the conductor including the surface.  

Additionally we assume that these primary induced fields are “ non radiative”  inside this 

region. As a result we can consider the metallic boundary as a surface S′  with a known 

distribution of electric and magnetic source fields.  

We  assume  that  the  induced  surface  fields  radiate  into  the  vacuum  and  that  the 

field  radiated  into  free  space  can  be  found  using  the  Huygens-Fresnel  principle.    For

the electric field  on the tilted surface  S′ ,   R

 is the radius vector of  the observation point 

and  R′  is the distance  from surface element   dS′   to the observation point.   

Whether the radiation is DR or TR depends only on  the size and structure of the 

area  of  integration  S′ .    The  radiation  is  TR  if  the  area  of  integration  is  large    (i.e. 

max(

radiation is DR if  max(

 or if there are regions in the area where ,a ⊥(cid:38) = 0, e.g.

 and  S⊥′  is a large solid area of integration normal to 

the particle trajectory. 

  

The angular distribution of DR depends strongly on the size of integration area, 

the coordinates of the particles, the distribution of the holes in the foil and the angle of 

inclination of the foil.  Note also that, in general, the perpendicular intensity  DRI ⊥  is not 

 

12

zero  even  if  V is  parallel  to  the  observation  plane.    In  contrast  to  DR,  the  angular 

distribution  of  TR  is  independent  of  the  coordinates,  the  spatial  distribution  of  the 

particles and the angle ϕ and   TRI ⊥ = 0,  when  V is parallel to the observation plane.   

In  our  model  a  small  deviation  of  the  trajectory  angle  of  an  electron  from  the  z 

axis corresponds to a small deviation of the tilt angle of the foil from the angle 

045ν =

. 

We  have  found  that  for  small  angular  deviations,  i.e. 

Δ ≤
ν

5 /

γ

≈

0.05 rad

  the  angular 

pattern  of  the  radiation  produced  from  any  particle  in  the  unit  cell  is  practically 

unaffected by the deviation angle (i.e. the intensity changes less than few percent in the 

worst case). We conclude that the pattern of radiation of an electron deflected from the z 

axis  by  a  small  deviation  angle  is  centered  about  the  deviation  angle  with  the  same 

distribution as that of an undeflected electron about its trajectory angle. This situation is 

well known for TR, i.e the centroid of the far field radiation pattern “follows” the angle 

of  trajectory  of  electron  for  forward  TR  and  the  specular reflection  angle  for  backward 

(reflected) TR.   

 

Observations in the Detection Plane 

In addition to the angular coordinates 

yθ θ  it is convenient to introduce angular -

,x

cylindrical  coordinates  ˆ,θϕ  (

, 
xθ θ ϕ

ˆ cos

=

yθ θ ϕ

ˆ sin

)  to  describe  directions  in  the 

detection  plane.    In  these  coordinates  the  ϕ  plane  of  observation  projected  to  the 

detection plane  is represented by the line 

ϕ=

const

, the horizontal plane of observation 

by the line 

0ϕ=  and the vertical plane of observation by the line 

ϕ π=

/ 2

.  We will also 

use  the  vector

describe  the  direction  of  the  trajectory  of  the  particle  and  the  direction  of  observation, 

As it is shown above the center of the radiation pattern of any electron interacting 

with the mesh follows the direction of the trajectory of the particle.  Mathematically, this 

means that the distribution of intensity produced by the particle with trajectory  

 can be

to determine additionally needed values by interpolation.  

Computing the effect of beam divergence 

         The effect of beam divergence on the intensities computed above is performed by 

means of a two dimensional angular convolution. In order to perform this convolution it 

is  necessarily  to  know  the  intensity  produced  by  all  particles  of  each  beam  fraction 

(scattered and unscattered) with trajectory angle 

 at  the observation point  

, as well 

(cid:71)
eθ

(cid:71)
kθ

as the distribution of trajectory angles of the beam electrons.  

We  model  the  distribution  of  electron  trajectory  angles  as  a  sum  of  up  to  three 

individual  Gaussian  components.    For  instance  in  the  case  of  the  mesh  the  wires 

substantially scatter electrons  up to few mrads  completely “hiding” the original angular 

distribution  which  is  usually  a  fraction  of  one  mrad.  The  scattered  portion  of  the  beam 

evidently has wider angular distribution than the unperturbed beam passing through the 

holes  and  is  represented  as  a  single  wide  Gaussian  component.    However,  the  angular 

distribution  of  the  “unperturbed”  unscattered  portion  of  the  beam  is  more  complex  and 

cannot be represented by a single Gaussian distribution. We have modeled this situation 

 

 

 

 

 

16

by  splitting  the  U  fraction  of  the  beam  into  two  individual  Gaussian  components,  the 

minimum number required for our fits. Note that the zero angle of the total distribution is 

the same before and after scattering and is the same for all components.  

In  angular  coordinates  and  using  the  small  angle  approximation,  the  multi-

Gaussian  component beam can be presented as:

which is the OTRI limit.  In our analysis of OTRI data, the angular convolution for TR 

interferometer    is  performed  using  Eq.  (26)  and  two  Gaussian  components  to  represent 

the unscattered beam distribution.       

 

    

Additional Convolutions 

  

To account for variations of the beam energy and the observation wavelength, we 

can optionally perform separate convolutions or averages over these variables as well as 

angular  convolution.    To  account  for  finite  band  of  observed  wavelengths,  we  assume 

that  the  spectral  characteristic  of  the  band  pass  filter  is  rectangular  and  perform  an 

convolution  of  the  intensity  scan  over  the  filter  transmission  function.  To  account  for 

possible variations in beam energy we can perform a convolution of the scanned intensity 

over energy under the assumption that the energy distribution has a cosine distribution. 

Optional forms for the energy variation are Gaussian or rectangular distributions.

Unpolarized OTRI and ODTRI 

 

In the experiments described below unpolarized OTRI and ODTRI images are 

used, i.e. no polarizer was used.  The reason for this is that analysis shows that the use of 

a  polarizer does not give any advantage when a 2D angular convolution code is used to 

evaluate the data.  

On the other hand, calculations show that the polarized intensity is less sensitive 

to  the  corresponding  perpendicular  angular  divergence  σ⊥ .  For  example,  if  the 

polarization  axis  is  the  x  direction, 

σ σ⊥ =

y

.  If 

σ σ⊥ (cid:19) , the  divergence  component 

x

along  the  polarization  axis,  there  will  be  little  difference  between  polarized  and  non 

polarized intensities.  However, at moderate and large values of  

xσ , σ⊥  should be taken 

into account in order to correctly calculate the polarized intensity. This means that a 2D 

angular convolution must be done in any case. Hence there is no advantage in using the 

polarizer. For these reasons we measure and use the total intensity interferogram obtained 

without the use of a polarizer.  From this interferogram the divergence in any direction 

can be determined by simply scanning along the desired angular direction. 

 Demonstration of Simulation Code Results  

 

 

In Figure 5. we present results of simulation code calculations of the sum of ODR 

contributions  from  the  beam  electrons  which  pass  through  the  holes  of  the  mesh 

(unscattered beam) and the sum of ODR contributions from the electrons passing through 

the mesh wires (scattered beam), for a 5 micron thick, 750 lines per inch copper mesh, 

with 25 μm square holes and a cell period p = 33 μm (55% transparency). The percentage 

of the ODR intensities from unscattered and scattered beam components is about 10% of 

the total radiation. The OTR generated at the mirror from the scattered and unscattered  

 

20

components  are  55%  and  45%  respectively,  in  accordance  with  the  mesh  transparency.  

The  beam  energy  used  in  the  calculations  shown  in  Figure  5.  is  50  MeV.    Similar 

calculations were done for 95 MeV. The code results show that the angular distributions 

of ODR from electrons passing through the holes and the wires are similar to that of OTR 

from a solid foil.  Since all these distributions are slowly varying function of observation 

angle, the main effect of beam divergence, represented mathematically by a convolution 

of the intensity (see Eqs. 1 and 2) with a distribution of electron angles is to blur or

divergence  diagnostics  with  both  OTRI  and  ODTRI  when  the  energy  spread  is  smaller 

than the normalized divergence which is the case in the present study.   

The interference term for OTRI and ODTRI is the same since this term depends 

only  on  the  relative  phase  of  the  radiation  from  the  first  foil  and  the  mirror.  Figure  6. 

shows the interferences generated from the individual ODR intensity components  

described  above.    Note  that  for  the  scattered  component  the  fringe  visibility  is  close  to 

zero, i.e. the fringes produced by the scattered component of ODR is completely washed 

out. This is intentionally done by choosing the atomic number and thickness of the mesh 

for a given beam energy, such that heavy scattering (σs = 4 mrad) of the electrons ensues.

In  this  situation  the  fringes  due  to  the  unscattered  (unperturbed)  beam  component  are 

made  visible  above  the  smooth  (incoherent)  scattered  beam  contribution.  The  two 

components add to form the black curve in Figure 6. The fringe visibility is affected by 

the  inherent  (unperturbed)  beam  divergence,  which  for  illustration  is  σ = 0.5 mrad.  The 

wavelength chosen for the calculation is 650 nm with a delta function band pass.

Description of the Experimental Setup 

The beam  energies used in  our experiments are 50 and 95 MeV. The setups for 

both experiments are essentially the same. Both employ optical trains which accept and 

maintain an angular field of view of approximately 10/γ and transport the light to cameras 

positioned  away  from  the  foil-mirror  position  to  reduce  the  x-ray  background.  A 

schematic of the optics used at the BNL/ATF is given in Figure 7. for illustration. Details 

of the experimental setup of the NPS 95 MeV experiment have been previously described 

in  [19].    For  each  experiment,  care  must  be  taken  to  insure  that  the  second  camera  is 

focused on the plane of the mirror, i.e. the OTR radiator/reflector. This is done with the 

help of a  graticule target, whose surface is coplanar with the mirror. 

To  image  the  far  field  angular  distribution,  i.e.  the  OTR  or  ODTR  interference 

pattern we used Apogee Instruments Inc., 16 bit, Peltier cooled, high QE, low noise CCD 

cameras each of  which is equipped with an electronically controlled mechanical shutter;

this allows the CCD to integrate the light produced from multiple electron beam pulses. 

A model Alta E47+ was used at ATF and a model AP230E was used at NPS.  A second 

less sensitive RS 170, 8-bit CCD camera (Cohu 4912 or GBC-CCTV 500E) was used to 

monitor the beam’s spatial distribution.   

The first lens shown in Figure 7, which has a focal length f1=44cm, is placed 47 

cm  from  the  mirror.  In  the  focal  plane  of  this  lens  an  image  of  the  far  field  angular 

distribution (AD) appears. A second lens whose focal length f2 = 20cm placed at 168 cm 

from the mirror is used to re-image the AD in the image plane of camera C2. The object 

and  images  distances  for  C2  are  77  and  28  cm  respectively.  A  light  baffle  is  used  to 

prevent direct reflection from the first foil or mesh from entering the optical path. 

Identical  interferometers  but  with  different  foil-mirror  spacings:  d  =  37  and  47 

mm, for the 50 and 95 MeV beams respectively, were used in the experiments.  

A photograph of the target ladder housing the interferometers is shown in Figure 

8. This apparatus was mounted on a stepper motor driven, 6-inch linear actuator. One of 

four positions (components) of the ladder could be placed into the beam: 1) a graticule, 

used  to  determine  the  magnification  of  the  system;  2)  an  aluminized  Silicon  mirror  cut 

from a 0.5 mm wafer, used alone for alignment of the optics with an upstream laser;  3) 

the OTR interferometer, consisting the mirror and  a 0.7 micron thick foil of 99.5% pure 

aluminum  mounted  on  a  stretcher  ring  (the  apparatus  seen  on  the  right  hand  side  of 

23

 

 

 

 

Figure  8.  and  also  in  reflection  from  the  mirror);  and  4)  the  ODR  interferometer 

consisting  of  the  mirror  and  a  micromesh  foil,  which  is  also  mounted  on  a  circular 

stretcher ring.  

The  foils  and  mirror  are  parallel  and  tilted  at  45  degrees  with  respect  to  the 

direction  of  the  electron  beam.  The  forward  directed  radiation  from  each  foil  and  the 

backward  OTR  are  observed  in  reflection  from  the  mirror  through  a  fused  silica  view 

port. To align and focus the far field camera, a HeNe laser (632nm) pointing down stream 

along  the  beam  line  axis  was  used  to  create  an  optical  diffraction  pattern  with  the 

micromesh  in  place.  The  resulting  diffraction  pattern  formed  a  cross  of  dots,  with  the 
central dot (zeroth order) specifying the direct beam. The higher order dots were located 

at angular positions θ = nλ/p where n is the diffraction order, λ is the wavelength and p is 

the hole period.  This pattern provided an excellent angular calibration source for the far 

field camera.  

The  ATF  linac  at  Brookhaven  National  Laboratory  and  the  Naval  Postgraduate 

School  linac  beam  have  the  following  characteristics:  ATF:  1.5  pps,  500-700  pC  per 

pulse, NPS: 60 pps, 0.1-0.8 μA average current; the normalized rms emittances have been

. The foil-

mirror spacings were determined from calculations to produce an optimal number of 

interferences for the beam energy and expected range of divergence for each beam. The 

optimal spacings and band passes for these two situations were determined prior to the 

experiment by applying the results of computer code runs for both OTRI and ODTRI 

interferences. 

At NPS a pair of quadrupole magnets up stream of the target chamber were used 

to magnetically focus the beam to either an x or y waist condition at the mirror position. 

The waist condition was confirmed by observing the maximum sharpness of the higher 

order  interference  fringes  [20].  At  a  beam  waist  the  visibility  of  the  observed  OTR  or 

ODTR interference fringes in the x (horizontal) or y (vertical) directions is a measure of 

the corresponding x or y rms beam divergence. Thus, together with knowledge of the rms 

(x or y) size at the corresponding (x or y ) waist  obtained from the spatial image of the 

beam  and  the  corresponding  rms  divergence  obtained  from  the  interference  pattern,  the 

rms x and y beam emittance could be determined.   

 

 

 

Results and Analysis 

 
Data Fitting Procedure 
 

ODTRI and OTRI experiments were performed on the NPS 95 MeV accelerator 

focusing the beam to both x and y waist conditions at the site of the interferometer mirror 

and on the ATF accelerator for two different beam tunes. A camera focused on the mirror 

monitored the beam size in both cases.  To obtain a good signal to noise ratio (S/N>2) we 

found it necessary to integrate over many beam pulses to build up a good interferogram. 

At the NPS this time was about 60 seconds, while for the ATF the integration time was of 

the order of 5 minutes.   

For  each  interferogram  we  extracted  two  mutually  perpendicular  scans,  e.g. 

horizontal  and  vertical.  Averaging  of  the  intensity  over  an  angular  sector  about  the 

horizontal or vertical direction is first performed at each radial distance from the center of 

the  pattern.  The  sector  angle  is  chosen  such    that  the  visibility  of  the  fringes  along  a 

sector averaged  line scan through the center of the pattern is not noticeably different by 

25

the  eye  from  that  of  a  simple  un-averaged,  albeit  noisy,  single  line  scan  through  the 

center.  Sector  averaging  improves  the  signal  to  noise  ratio  substantially  especially  for 

noisy images and provides smooth line scans which are then fit to the  simulation code 

calculations to give the value of the rms divergence 

 To fit the scanned data to simulation code scans we compare the data to a family 

of theoretical curves each obtained for a particular set of beam parameters: divergence, 

energy,  energy  spread  and  fractional  weight,  when  more  than  one  beam  component  is 

required,  and  interferometer  foil  spacing.    The  goal  is  to  achieve  the  best  set  of 

parameters which simultaneously provides a ’best fit’ to both the horizontal and vertical 

sector averaged data scans. 

 The  goodness  of  the  fit  of  measured 

( )E θ   and  calculated 

( )T θ   scans  is 

determined  first  qualitatively  by  eye  and  then  more  rigorously  using  the  following 

procedure.  The essence of this procedure is to scale the data scan by a constant A until 

the best fit of the data scan to the theoretically calculated scan is obtained.  To do this we 

have  written  a  code  to  compare  the  similarity  of  the  two  functions

  is  the  experimentally  measured  intensity  distribution,  scaled  by  A  ,  an

described above. The closer the functions 

A E θ⋅

 and 

( )T θ  are to each other the smaller 

the value of D;  the further these functions are from each other the closer D is to unity. 

       We  define  the  maximum  similarity  of  the  two  functions  when  D(A)  is  at  its

.  Any change of the set of the parameters used

to calculate T(θ) changes the shape of theoretical curve and the values of 

minD  and  minA . 

The  goal  is  to  achieve  the  best  set  of  parameters  which  simultaneously  gives  the  best 

similarity for both the horizontal and vertical scans.  The “best fit” occurs when we have 

 

26

found a set of beam parameters, interferometer parameters and values of  

minD  and  minA  

for which the eye judges that the best similarity is achieved.   Note that in the ideal case  

Dmin = 0. 

 

Adjustment of the parameters used to fit the experimental scan data to simulation 

code or theoretical calculations is performed in the following way: 

1)  parameters of the interferometer and expected (starting) parameters of the beam, 

i.e.  foil  separation  d,  filter  pass  band,  electron  energy  band,  parallel  σp  and 

normal σn  angular divergences, angular interval for fitting are inputted. 

2)   theoretical/simulation  code  calculations  are  performed  for  both  horizontal  and 

vertical  scans  and  the  theoretical  and  renormalized  experimental  curves  are 

plotted. 

3)  a comparison of experimental and theoretical curves and adjustment of the  input 

parameters is made to achieve the best similarity between theory and experiment 

simultaneously for both horizontal and vertical scans, i.e. by minimizing the rms 

4)  adjustment of σp , σn energy and d are made to get the best fit to the interference

pattern. 

5)  a check of the effect of energy spread and pass filter on fringe visibility is done; if 

these  effects  are  negligible,  fine  tuning  of  parameters  is  then  done  to  minimize 

both the rms deviations for horizontal and vertical scans. 

6)  if needed, the beam distribution is split into two fractions and adjustment of the 

parameters of second beam is performed to improve the best fit. 

7)  if necessary, a third beam fraction is introduced and adjustment of the parameters 

of the third beam is performed. (NB: this third component is only used to estimate 

effect of the scattered component from the mesh wires). 

Example of Data Fitting Procedure  

 

 

To illustrate the procedure employed to fit the sector averaged line scans used in 

all  our  analyses  of  OTRI  and  ODTRI  patterns,  we  will  use  an  OTRI  from  NPS  as  an 

 

27

example. The OTR interference pattern for the NPS beam focused to a y (vertical ) beam 

waist  is shown in Figure 9. The measured rms y size of the beam at the y waist condition 

is ~ 1mm. The OTRI pattern was obtained by exposing the far field CCD camera for 45 

seconds; the picture is taken with an optical filter band pass filter in place  ( 650nm, 70 

nm FWHM band pass). The colored sectors overlaying the image in Figure 9. show the 

angular regions used to average the intensity at each radius measured from the center of 

the pattern.

Figure 10. shows the fit to the vertical line scan of OTRI taken at a y using the 

convolution of a 2D Gaussian function with Eq. (1), for two different values of  the rms 

beam divergence, σ = 0.6 mrad and 0.7 mrad, along with experimental data, i.e. the sector 

averaged vertical scan of Figure 9.  The overall best fit to the data (i.e. all the fringes) is 

seeming provided by the σ = 0.7 mrad fit. However, note that the best fit to the higher 

order  fringes  (i.e.  angles  larger  than  1.5/γ shown  in  the  expanded  region  on  right  of 

Figure 10.) is better with a value of σ = 0.6 mrad. On the other hand this value produces a 

fit that is poorer for the lower order fringes , i.e. angles smaller than 1.5/γ.

Figure 10. Comparison of the effect of single Gaussian distribution functions with 

different rms widths on the OTRI fringes (left); expanded plot region (right). 

A variational analysis the interference phase term in Eq. (1) shows that the effect 

of divergence on the fringe visibility is proportional to the fringe order so that the effect 

of  increasing  the  divergence  is  seen  as  a  reduced  fringe  visibility  for  the  higher  order 

fringes first [21].  The higher order fringes are better fit by single Gaussian with     σ = 

0.6  mrad  but  the  lower  order  fringes  are  not  fit  well  with  this  same  function;  this  is 

evidence  that  the  real  beam  angle  distribution  is  not  well  represented  by  a  single 

Gaussian.  

To improve the fit to the data we have introduced a second 2D Gaussian function 

in  addition  to  the  primary  Gaussian  to  model  the  distribution  of  electron  angles.    The 

fractional amplitudes and rms widths of both Gaussians were adjusted to provide the best 

fit  (dot  dashed  blue  line)  to  the  data  (solid  red  line)  shown  in  Figure  11.  The  primary 

distribution fraction is weighted by 0.75 and its rms width, σ = 0.6 mrad.  

 The effect of the primary distribution (Comp1) on the OTRI fringes is shown by 

the dashed black curve. The effect of the secondary distribution (Comp2) is shown by the 

dot-dashed green line. The total effect of the two components  is represented by the dot-

dashed blue line. As is seen from Figure 11. the overall fit to the data is excellent with the 

two component model over the entire range of observation angles.

Similarly  we  used  a  two  component  distribution  to  represent  the  angular 

distribution of the unscattered electrons to fit the ODTRI data. However, in the case of 

ODTRI a third Gaussian component representing the scattering of the beam in the wires 

of  the  mesh,  which  is  always  present  regardless  of  the  number  of  inherent  beam 

components,  is  also  used  in  the  fit.  This  component  is  similar  in  its  effect  to  the  broad 

primary beam component shown in Figure 11.

Figure  13.  presents  ODTRI  and  OTRI  for  the  NPS  beam  focused  to  an  x

in Figures 9. and 12., indicating that the x (horizontal) beam divergence is larger than the

from  fitting  both  the  OTRI  and  ODTRI  averaged  line  scans  is  1.2  mad.  This  value  is 

about twice as large as the y (vertical) divergence given above.  The quality of the x waist

Figure 14. Horizontal averaged line scans of  ODTRI (left) and OTRI (right) shown in Figure 13. 

A comparison of the other ODTRI and OTRI fit parameters is provided in Table 

1. There is a slight difference in the spacing, 36.5 mm for the ODTRI vs. 37.2 mm for the 

OTRI, which is most likely due to a small difference in orientation of the two foils with 

respect  to  the  beam  direction  due  to  rotational  wobble  in  the  linear  drive.  Previous 

analysis [15,21] has shown that the position of the fringes is a sensitive function of the 

beam energy and spacing but that the visibility of the fringes is primarily affected by the 

divergence, when the energy spread of the beam is small in comparison to the normalized 

divergence.

ATF Data Fits 

ODTRI-OTRI  experiments  were  done  at  the  ATF  accelerator  for  two  different 

beam tunes, i.e. two sets of beam sizes and divergences, which were obtained by tuning a 

magnetic  triplet  upstream  of  the  ODTRI  interferometer.  The  beam  parameters  for  each 

beam tune are independently determined from multiple screen beam size measurements 

and transport code calculations. Three beam profile monitors (YAG screens) were placed 

upstream  of  the  ODTR  interferometer  and  one  beam  profile  monitor  (fluorescence 

screen) downstream. The electron beam size at each monitor was measured. By fitting the 

beam  sizes  with  a  trajectory  calculated  by  transfer  matrices  of  quadrupoles  and  drift 

spaces, 

the  sigma  matrix  at 

the 

interferometer  position  was  computed  and 

correspondingly  the  beam  size,  divergence  and  emittance  were  obtained  as  well.    The 

parameters for the first beam tune were: x = 0.18 mm, y = 0.27 mm, σx = 0.31 mrad and 

σy = 0.22 mrad.  

Figure 15.  shows  ODTR and OTR interference patterns obtained with the first 

beam tune. The ODTRI and OTRI patterns are obtained with integration times of 480 and 

360 seconds respectively with a 650 x 10 nm band pass filter. The narrower band pass, 

i.e.  10  nm  for  ATF  vs.  70  nm  for  NPS,  is  required  to  obtain  the  sensitivity  (greater 

number  of  fringes)  required  to  measure  the  lower  divergence  of  the  ATF  beam.  The 

smaller band pass and the additional lower average current of the ATF in comparison to 

NPS necessitated a longer integration time for the ATF, which was limited by the build 

up of background due to x-rays. Consequently the use of sector averaging was especially 

important for the ATF data.

Figure  16.    Note  that  the  number  of  visible  fringes  in  the  ODTRI  scan  exceeds  the

by scattering in the first foil.

visibility. 

Discussion   

These are listed and analyzed below. 

1.  Energy Spread 

 

 

The energy spread of the ATF beam was monitored during the experiment and is 

less than 0.5%. Both variational analysis of the interference terms in Eq. 1. [21] and our 

convolution codes show that this spread is  too small to be responsible for the observed 

fringe blurring; i.e. the energy spread would have to be 16 times larger (8%) to show the 

effect observed at ATF. The energy spread at NPS is higher than ATF, i.e. a few percent. 

However, the divergence of the NPS beam is also higher. Both variational analysis and 

computer  convolution  calculations  show  that  the  energy  spread  is  not  sufficient  to 

significantly affect the observed visibility. 

2.  Bandwidth of the Filter 

A fixed bandwidth optical bandpass filter was used in all runs, so blurring due to 

changes in wavelength outside the bandpass is not possible. Numerical convolution of the 

transmission functions for the filter used at both ATF ( 650 x 10 nm FWHM ) and NPS 

(650 x 70 nm FWHM) shows in each case that the filter bandpass has a negligible effect 

on the fringe visibility.  

 

 

36

 

 

 

 

3.  Beam Halo 

  

We  have  considered  the  possibility  that  there  is  a  beam  halo  component  in 

addition to a core component and that the beam core and halo have different spatial and 

angular distributions. The presence of a halo is certainly possible at NPS and in fact dark 

current  component  is  known  to  exist  and  has  been  observed  in  previous  experiments, 

although  its  divergence  has  not  been  measured.  Dark  current  components  have  been 

observed  in  other  linacs  also,  e.g.  the  8  MeV  ANL-AWA.  The  present  analysis  shows 

that this component is at the 20% level for NPS. Such a component would not likely be 

noticeable, e.g. from an observation of the beam spatial distribution, which is limited by 

the dynamic range of the beam imaging camera (8 bit CCD) used. 

However,  at  ATF,  the  presence  of  a  large  (i.e.  60%  of  total)  background  beam 

component,  inferred  from  both  the  OTRI  and  ODTRI  fits,  would  probably  have  been 

previously observed but this has not been reported. Since our observations of the beam 

profile was again limited to 8 bits, we cannot completely rule out the existence of a halo 

in  our  runs.  However,  since  a  large  halo  component  is  unlikely,  we  have  examined 

another  possible  explanation  for  the  inferred  bimodal  distribution  and  large  second 

component  fraction,  i.e.  the  effect  of  beam  stability  during  the  rather  long  integration 

times required for ATF experiments (360s for OTRI and 480s for ODTRI).  

4.  Beam Instabilities 

 

 

affect our results. These include: 

a. Jitter in the beam position 

There  are  several  types  of  beam  stabilities  that  could  be  present  and  possibly 

This type of jitter has no effect on the far field angular distributions of OTRI and 

ODTRI. 

b.  Random jitter in the trajectory angle of the beam 

This effect would combined with the effect of the beam core divergence resulting 

in as a single Gaussian distribution whose full width would be calculable from quadrature 

addition of the FWHMs of the components, one related to the inherent temperature of the 

beam, the other to a jitter of the trajectory angle would be seen as a single Gaussian with 

 

37

a  wider  rms  width:   

σ σ σ .  A  single  Gaussian  with  width  σtot  would  have  a

jitter

predictable  effect  on  the  fringe  visibility.  Since  the  fringes  cannot  be  fit  with  a  single 

Gaussian distribution, a random jitter effect must be ruled out. 

c.  Non-random jitter of the trajectory angle of the beam 

This  effect  would  appear  as  a  distinct  non  Gaussian  distribution  and  possibly 

explain  the  need  for  a  second  distinct  component  in  addition  to  the  core  beam  angular 

distribution.  Since  we  did  not  continuously  monitor  the  beam  position  during  the 

experiment and acquire the data that would allow a statistical calculation of the jitter, we 

cannot rule out this possibility. We therefore conclude that a nonrandom instability in the 

beam position, during the long image integration times, is a possible explanation for the 

observed  two  Gaussian  component  fit.  A  future  experiment  will  be  needed  to  test  this 

possibility. 

Conclusions 

We  have  obtained  nearly  identical  divergences  and  beam  fractions  using  two 

independent  measurements,  i.e.  OTRI  and  ODTRI.  The  divergence  obtained  agree  wel 

with  those  obtained  by  independent  multiple  screen  measurement-transport  code 

calculations.    The  analysis  of  the  OTRI  and  ODTRI  data  are  very  different.    OTRI 

analysis  uses  a  direct  convolution  of  an  exact  analytic  expression  to  obtain  a  fringe 

pattern,  which  is  then  fit  to  the  data.    The  analysis  and  fitting  of  ODTRI,  on  the  other 

hand, is much more complicated and requires a simulation code to perform.   It is very 

unlikely  that  these  two  independent  calculations  and  fits  to  data  would  produce  nearly 

identical  results  that  both  agree  with  the  independent  multiple  screen  analysis.  We 

conclude  that  ODTRI  and  OTRI  are  indeed  being  affected  by  the  same,  real  physical 

effect  and  that  the  simulation  code  and  data  fitting  procedures  we  have  employed  are 

correct and consistent. 

We emphasize that we have not set out to prove that electron beams, under certain 

operating  conditions  can  show  bimodal  distributions  -  which  is  the  conclusion  of  our 

analysis  of  both  OTRI  and  ODTRI.    Rather,  we  have  set  out  to  show  that  ODTRI  is  a 

viable diagnostic technique to measure beam divergence whatever the beam conditions.   

38

 

 

 

Our  results  show  that  the  divergences  and  component  intensities  measured  by 

ODTRI  match  those  obtained  by  OTRI,  for  two  separate  experiments  on  two  different 

accelerators  with  significantly  different  beam  properties.  Furthermore,  the  divergences 

due to the core beam component are in agreement with other independent measurements 

and simulation code results. Thus, we have well demonstrated that ODTRI is a valid new 

divergence diagnostic method which extends and can even replace OTRI as a diagnostic 

for low energy and or very low divergence beams. 

Since  the  ODTRI  fringes  are  sensitive  to  the  unperturbed  beam,  which  passes 

through the holes of a micromesh foil, ODTRI overcomes the lower limit on measurable 

divergence present in a conventional OTR interferometer, i.e. scattering in the solid first 

foil. Hence ODTRI can be used to diagnose lower emittance and/or lower energy beams. 

Our demonstration of ODTRI as a useful rms divergence diagnostic indicates that 

it may be possible to use ODTRI to make localized beam divergence and trajectory angle 

measurements,  i.e.  within  the  beam’s  spatial  distribution,  and  therefore  to  produce  a 

transverse  phase  space  map  of  the  beam.  Optical  phase  space  mapping  (OPSM)  has 

already  been  demonstrated  using  OTRI  [19,20].    Presuming  the  problem  of  the  lower 

intensity  yield  of  ODR  compared  to  OTR  can  be  overcome,  e.g.  by  increasing  the 

integration time or beam current, OPSM using ODTRI should be straightforward.

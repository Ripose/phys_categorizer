Abstract

A quantum particle interacting with a thin solenoid and a magnetic ﬂux
is described by a ﬁve-parameter family of Hamilton operators, obtained
via the method of self-adjoint extensions. One of the parameters, the
value of the ﬂux, corresponds to the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect; the other
four parameters correspond to the strength of a singular potential bar-
rier. The spectrum and eigenstates are computed and the scattering
problem is solved.

0 Introduction

The purpose of this paper is to obtain and study the most general family of oper-
ators which describe the essential features of a quantum mechanical particle under
the joint eﬀect of the electromagnetic potential due to a ﬂux φ together with the
potential barrier supported on the inﬁnite thin shielded solenoid.

Our initial task is to provide a class of well deﬁned operators corresponding to

the formal diﬀerential (plus distributional) expression

where x1, x2, x3 are the standard coordinates in IR3, A = ı(φ/2πr2)(

is a pure gauge potential and r = ((x1)2 + (x2)2)1/2. For that aim, we ﬁrst reduce the
problem to two dimensions by making use of translational symmetry with respect
to the coordinate x3. Let r, θ be, respectively, the radial and angular coordinate in
IR2, 0

The method we adopt in this paper is based on self adjoint extensions of sym-
metric operators. From this perspective, we try to combine two well known cases
which were already extensively discussed in the literature. The ﬁrst one, with α = 0,
corresponds to the so called point interaction (cf. [3]) and was studied in detail in
[2]. An operator in a one-parameter family is deﬁned on a domain which is charac-
terized by a linear relation between certain coeﬃcients which are built up from the
asymptotic behaviour, as r
0, of (singular) wave functions. The starting point
was a symmetric operator with a domain formed by wave functions with supports
separated from the origin. The deﬁciency indices turned out to be (1,1).

→

The second case, with λ = 0, corresponds to the pure Aharonov-Bohm (A-B)
potential [1] and was investigated many times on diﬀerent levels (see [7], [9], [4], [8],
[10]). The generalized eigenfunctions are required to belong to H 2,2
) and
at the origin the regular condition

loc(IR2

\ {

}

0

r→0+

f (r, θ) = 0

is imposed. As the Hamiltonian enjoys rotational symmetry the generalized eigen-
functions are known and the scattering problem is solved explicitly.

However, it has been known already for some time that when decomposing the

Hilbert space into a direct sum,

L2(IR2, d2x)

then the A-B operator decomposes correspondingly and in the channels m =
1
−
and m = 0 the boundary condition (2) is not the most general one. But since the
other boundary conditions admit wave functions which are singular at the origin
they were usually ruled out.

To our opinion, it makes good sense to consider the most general case and hence
to allow even a sort of interaction between the two channels. Thus we apply to the
pure A-B Hamiltonian exactly the same procedure which was used in the case of
point interactions. The deﬁciency indices one obtains this way are (2,2) and this
indicates clearly that the result is not simply a superposition of the two special
cases.

1 Five-parameter family of Hamilton operators

and their resolvents

In order to get operators which can be consistently interpreted as describing the
physical situation we are interested in, we start with the case of pure A-B eﬀect and
IR2 in the usual way. Namely, ﬁrst we consider
introduce the point interaction at 0
the restriction of the self-adjoint pure A-B operator H to the space of functions with
supports outside of
, obtaining thus a closable symmetric operator. Then we shall
ﬁnd all possible self-adjoint extensions of its closure ˜H.
The adjoint ˜H ∗ is deﬁned as the diﬀerential operator

On general grounds, ˜H has equal deﬁciency indices. To ﬁnd the corresponding
deﬁciency spaces we employ the decomposition (3). Since the orthogonal projection

Next, selecting in the two-dimensional space of solutions the one which vanishes

To ensure the integrability we still have to control the asymptotics as r

case α = 0 is known; the L2 solutions exist only in the sector m = 0 and thus the

where k = eıπ/4 (k = √ı with Im k > 0) and the normalization constants N1, N2

This means that all self-adjoint extensions are in one-to-one correspondence with
the elements of the unitary group U(2) and are determined by boundary conditions
at the origin. We treat them in detail in the next section. Thus we get, apart of α
characterizing the magnetic ﬂux, four additional parameters.

At this point, let us make a short digression and recall a useful formula comparing
resolvents of two self-adjoint extensions. It is stated in the framework of Krein’s
approach to the theory of self-adjoint extensions and was presented originally in [5].

terized as diﬀerential operators with some well speciﬁed boundary conditions. For
this purpose, we introduce four linear functionals Φn

ing to the two critical angular sectors and to the ﬁrst two leading terms giving the
asymptotic behaviour of the radial part of ψ as r

The real submanifold of G2(C 4) determined by (53) is mapped bijectively onto the
real 4-dimensional submanifold of G2(C 4)♯ determined by

A1D−1A∗

We conclude that each self-adjoint extension of ˜H is determined by a boundary
condition of the type

A1Φ1(ψ) + A2Φ2(ψ) = 0 ,

where A1, A2 ∈
1, A′
and (A′
GL(2,C) such that A′

Mat (2,C) verify (56) and rank(A1, A2) = 2. Two couples (A1, A2)

2) deﬁne the same self-adjoint operator if and only if there exists Y

1 = Y A1, A′

2 = Y A2.

Let us now restrict ourselves to an open dense subset of the manifold of boundary
Λ. The

conditions (57) which we obtain by ﬁxing A1 = I and setting A2 =

From (55) follows that one can choose X1 = Λ, X2 = I. In virtue of (54), this

leads to a relation between Λ and U,

Consider the LHS of (70) as a function F (p) deﬁned on ]0, +

(70) is always non-negative some elementary analysis gives immediately the number
of solutions. The number of roots of F (p) equals 0 or 1 or 2. There is no root iﬀ

As far as the eigenvectors are concerned, they have to be obtained, of course,
as solutions of the diﬀerential equation (6) including the corresponding boundary
conditions (58). First of all, it is clear that in the sectors of the angular momentum
m
1, 0, there is a complete system of generalized (and normalized) eigenfunctions
coinciding with those of the pure A-B eﬀect,

As far as the (true) eigenfunctions are concerned, the L2-integrability condition
at inﬁnity restricts the eigenvalue k2 to k2 < 0, and picks up a unique solution, up
to a multiplicative constant, in each sector m =
1 and m = 0 (this means that
both exponential growth and oscillatory behaviour at inﬁnity are excluded). Hence
setting as before k = ıp, with p > 0, the eigenfunction must have the form

4 Scattering

The existence of a complete and orthonormal basis of generalized eigenvectors is
suﬃcient to show that the wave (Møller) operators W± = limt→±∞ eıtH e−ıtH0
exist
and are complete. In fact, they can be exhibited explicitly as well as the scattering
operator S = (W+)∗W−.

−

From what we have said so far it is evident that W± and S preserve the sectors
1, 0, and there, they are exactly the same as in the pure A-B case; in particular
m
=
Sm = e2ıδm, where δm = (
)π/2. Thus we restrict ourselves to the

subspace L2(IR+, rdr)

(Cχ−1 ⊕

Jµ(x) = (2πx)1/2(eı(x−πµ/2−π/4) + e−ı(x−πµ/2−π/4)) + O(x3/4) ,

5 Conclusions

We have introduced and studied a ﬁve-parameter family of operators which describe
a quantum mechanical particle interacting with a magnetic ﬂux α caused by an in-
ﬁnite thin material solenoid. We conjecture that in some well deﬁned limit (when
the thickness of the solenoid
) which should be largely
0 and its length
independent on the details of approximating potentials (and which however goes
beyond the scope of this paper) such a situation is described by a (singular) poten-
tial barrier and by a electromagnetic potential concentrated along the z axis (the
magnetic ﬁeld vanishes in the remaining region). One of the ﬁve parameters is just
the value of the ﬂux α and the other four correspond to the strength of a singular
potential barrier (sort of a combination of Dirac δ and δ′) and can be interpreted as
penetrability coeﬃcients of the shielded solenoid.

A general operator of this family corresponds to an intricate mixture between
the Aharonov-Bohm eﬀect and the point interactions which is manifested more con-
cretely via the mixing between the angular and the radial boundary conditions. It
is interesting that the result we have obtained is richer than a simple superposition
of the point interaction and the pure A-B eﬀect. For instance, for a range of pa-
rameters there are two bound states possible while for the usual interactions with a
support concentrated along the z axis and symmetric under the z-translations (or,
equivalently, for a point interaction in two dimensions) there is always (except of the
free case) exactly one bound state, and for the pure A-B eﬀect there are no bound
states at all.

In the present paper we have derived an explicit formula for the scattering matrix
S(k; θ, θ0) depending on the ﬁve parameters. Naturally, it would be of interest to
examine the diﬀerential cross-section numerically, particularly its dependance on
the parameters, and to deduce some physical consequences. This is what we plan
to do separately.

It is a matter of experimental measurements (interference, scattering or in con-
densed matter) to establish which of the extensions in our family correspond to
realizable models. On general grounds, one can distinguish some class of exten-
sions by eg. symmetry requirements (conservation of the angular momentum), or
postulating that there are no bound states (solenoid as a repulsive barrier).

After completing most of our work we became aware of [12] which has an overlap
with some of our results. We have been also informed that a related preprint by R.
Adami and A. Teta is in preparation.

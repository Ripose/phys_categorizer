Recently  we  proposed  a  model  in  which  when  a  scientist  writes  a  manuscript,  he  picks  up  several  random 
papers,  cites  them  and  also  copies  a  fraction  of  their  references  (cond-mat/0305150).  The  model  was 
stimulated by our discovery   that a majority of scientific citations are copied from the lists of references used 
in other papers (cond-mat/0212043). It accounted quantitatively for several properties of empirically observed 
distribution  of  citations.  However,  important  features,  such  as  power-law  distribution  of  citations  to  papers 
published during the same year and the fact that the average rate of citing decreases with aging of a paper, 
were  not  accounted  for  by  that  model.  Here  we  propose  a  modified  model:  when  a  scientist  writes  a 
manuscript,  he  picks  up  several  random  recent  papers,  cites  them  and  also  copies  some  of  their  references. 
The difference with the original model is the word recent. We solve the model using methods of the theory of 
branching  processes,  and  find  that  it  can  explain  the  aforementioned  features  of  citation  distribution,  which 
our  original  model  couldn’t  account  for.  The  model  can  also  explain  “sleeping  beauties  in  science”,  i.e., 
papers that are little cited for a decade or so, and later “awake” and get a lot of citations. Although much can 
be  understood  from  purely  random  models,  we  find  that  to  obtain  a  good  quantitative  agreement  with 
empirical citation data one must introduce Darwinian fitness parameter for the papers. 
 

I. Introduction 
A  theory  of  citing  was  long  called  for  by 
bibliometrics  scholars  [1].  From  a  mathematical 
perspective an advance was recently made with the 
formulation  and  solution  of  the  model  of  random-
citing scientists [2]. According to the model, when 
a scientist writes   a manuscript he picks up several 
random  papers,  cites  them,  and  also  copies  a 
their  references.  The  model  was 
fraction  of 
stimulated by recursive literature search model [3] 
and  justified  by  the  fact  that  majority  of  scientific 
citations  are  copied  from  the  lists  of  references 
used  in  other  papers  [4] 1 .  The  model  leads  to 
cumulative  advantage  [5]  (better  known  today  as 
preferential attachment [6]) process, so that the rate 
of  citing  a  particular  paper  is  proportional  to  the 
number of citations it already  received.  In spite of 
its  simplicity,  the  model  appeared  to  account  for 

                                                 
1 Apart  from  the  analysis  of  misprint  propagation 
[4] this conclusion is indirectly supported by recent 
study  [40],  which  found  that  the  correlation 
coefficient between the number of citations to and 
the  number  of  readings  of    papers  in  arXiv.org  is 
only  r~0.45.  This  suggests  that  just  20%  (r2~0.2) 
of  variance  in  number  of  citations  is  explained  by 
the variance in the number of readings. 
 

several  major  properties  of  empirically  observed 
distribution of citations [2].  
A more involved analysis, however, reveals 
 
that certain subtleties of the citation distribution are 
not  accounted  for  by  the  model.  It  is  known,  that 
cumulative advantage process would lead to oldest 
papers  being  most  highly  cited  [6],  [7],  [8] 2.  In 
reality,  average  citation  rate  decreases  with  the 
increase  of  time  lapsed  since  publication  of  the 
paper in question [9], [10], [11], [12].  Cumulative 
advantage  process  would  also 
to  an 
exponential  distribution  of  citations  to  papers  of 
the same age [7], [8]. Empirically it was found that 
citations to papers published during the same  year 
are  distributed  according  to  a  power-law  (see  the 
ISI dataset in Fig.1(a) of Ref. [13]). 
the 
 
modified model of random-citing scientists: when a 
scientist  writes  a  manuscript  he  picks  up  several 
random  recent  papers  cites  them  and  also  copies

but with other social processes, modeled using the 
same  mathematical  tools.  In  the  present  paper  we 
will  be  rephrasing  the  results  of  those  papers  in 
terms of citations for simplicity.

some  of  their  references3.  The  difference  with  the 
original  model  is  the  word  recent.  We  solve  this 
model  using  methods  of  the  theory  of  branching 
processes [14] (we review its relevant elements   in 
Appendix  A),  and  show  that  it  explains  both  the 
power-law  distribution  of  citations 
to  papers 
published during the same year and literature aging. 

II. Branching citations 
While working on a paper, a scientist reads current 
issues  of  scientific  journals  and  selects  from  them 
the references to be cited in it. These references are 
of two sorts: 

• 

fresh  papers  he  had  just  read  –  to  embed 
the  context  of  current 
his  work 
aspirations.  

in 

•  older  papers  that  are  cited  in  the  fresh 
papers  he  had  just  read  –  to  position  his 
previous 
context 
work 
achievements.  

the 

of 

in 

It  is  not  a  necessary  condition  for  the  validity  of 
our  model  that  the  citations  to  old  papers  are 
copied,  but 
itself  remains  unread 
(although such opinion is supported by the studies 
of  misprint  propagation  [4]).  The  necessary 
conditions are as follows: 

the  paper 

• 

•  older  papers  are  considered  for  possible 
citing only if they were recently cited.  
if a citation to an old paper is followed and 
the  paper  is  formally  read  –  scientific 
qualities  of  that  paper  do  not  influence  its 
chance of being cited4.  

A  reasonable  estimate  for  the  length  of  time  a 
scientist  works  on  a  particular  paper  is  one  year. 
We will thus assume that “recent” in the model of 
random-citing  scientists  means  preceding  year.  To 
make  the  model  mathematically  tractable  we 
enforce time-discretization with a unit of one year. 
The  precise  model  to  be  studied  is  as  follows. 
                                                 
3  A  somewhat  similar  model  was  proposed  in 
Ref.[15] in the context of patents citations.   
4 This assumption may seem radical,    but look at 
the  following  example.  The  writings  of  J.  Lacan 
(10,000 citations) and G. Deleuze (8,000 citations) 
were  argued  to  be  nonsense  [38].  Sadly  enough, 
work of the true scientists is far less cited: A. Sokal 
– 2,700 citations, J. Bricmont – 1,000 citations.   
 

1.0»a

Every  year  N  papers  are  published.  There  is,  on 
average, 
refN  references  in  a  published  paper  (the 
actual  value  is  somewhere  between  20  and  40). 
Each  year  fraction  a of  references  goes 
to 
randomly  selected  preceding  year  papers  (the 
estimate5 from  actual  citation  data  is 
(see 
Fig.  4  of  Ref.  [9])  or 
15.0»a
 (see  Fig.  6  of  Ref. 
[13]). The remaining citations are randomly copied 
from the lists of references used in preceding  year 
papers. 
When  N  is  large  this  model  leads  to  first-
 
year  citations  being  Poisson-distributed  with  the 
mean 
refNal =0
The  number  of  second-year  citations  generated  by 
each  first  year  citation  (as  well  as  third  year 
citations  generated  by  each  second  year  citation 
and  so  on)  again  follows  a  Poisson  distribution, 
this time with the mean 
(
l -= 1
 
. 
Within  the  framework  of  this  model  citation 
process  is  a  branching  process  (see  Appendix  A) 
with  first  year  citations  equivalent  to  children, 
second-year  ones  to  grand  children  and  so  on. 
1<l , this branching process is subcritical.

5 The  uncertainty  in  the  value  of a depends  not 
only on the accuracy of the estimate of the fraction 
of  citations  which  goes  to  previous  year  papers. 
We  also  arbitrarily  defined  recent  paper  (in  the 
sense of our model), as the one published within a 
year.  Of  course,  this  is  by  order  of  magnitude 
correct but the true value can be anywhere between 
half a year and two years.

B.  Distribution  of  citations  to  papers  cited 
during the same year 
In Appendix A we computed the fraction of papers 
still  cited  k  years  after  publication  (Eq.(A6)),  as 
well  as  the  average  number  of  citations,  those 
papers  receive  during  the  kth  year  (Eq.(A7)).  Next 
we make an approximation assuming that all k-year 
old papers have same number of citations, equal to 
the average given by Eq.(A7). Then, the number of 
citations depends only on age, and number of cited 
papers  of  a  given  age  is  given  by  Eq.(A6).  After 
performing  simple  variables  substitution,  and

Similar  formula  was  previously  derived  [17],  [18] 
(by a different method) in the context of frequency 
distribution of selectively neutral alternative forms 
of  a  gene  in  a  biological  population.  The  model 
used in [17] and [18] is practically identical to ours 
with a  being  the  mutation  rate,  instead  of  the 
fraction  of  citations  going  to  new  papers.  The 
theory  developed  in  Refs.  [17]  and  [18]  was 
subsequently  used  to  study  cultural  transmission 
[19],  and  to  explain  how  some  cultural  elements 
become  highly  popular  even  if  they  have  no 
intrinsic  superiority  over  alternatives  [15],  [20], 
[21].   

III. Scientific Darwinism 
Now  we  proceed  to  investigate  the  model,  where 
papers  are  not  created  equal,  but  each  has  a 
specific Darwinian fitness, which is a bibliometric 
measure  of  scientific  fangs  and  claws  that  help  a 
paper  to  fight  for  citations  with  its  competitors. 
While  this  parameter  can  depend  on  factors  other 

 

3 

than the intrinsic quality of the paper, the fitness is 
the  only  channel  through  which  the  quality  can 
enter our model.  The probability of citing will be 
proportional to paper’s fitness, f, and, on average, 
it will have

fitness  of  published 
rate  by 
papers,
pj , to insure that   the fraction of citation 
going  to  previous  year  papers  remained  a.  In 
general,  the  fitness  distribution  of  references  will 
be  different  from 
the  fitness  distribution  of 
published papers, as more fit papers are cited more 
often.  This  distribution  assumes  an  asymptotic 
form ( )jrp
,  which  depends  on  the  distribution  of 
the  fitness  of  published  papers,
,  and  other 
parameters of the model.  
Similarly, for later-years citations there will be on

The  fitness  may  have  the  following  interpretation. 
When  a  scientist  writes  a  manuscript  he  needs  to 
include  in  it  a  certain  number  of  references6.    In 
order  to  collect  them,  he  sifts  through  scientific 
papers.  He  considers      papers  one  by  one  for 
possible  citation,  and  when  he  has  collected  the 
required number of citations, he stops. Every paper 
has  a  specific  probability  of  being  selected  for 
citation.  We  will  call  this  probability,  the  paper’s 
Darwinian  fitness.  Defined  in  such  way,  fitness  is 
bounded  between  0  and  1.    Let  us  consider  the 
( )jpp
simplest  case  when  the  fitness  distribution,
, 
is  uniform  in  that  interval.  This  choice  is  rather 
arbitrary,  but  we  will  see  that  the  resulting 
distribution  of  citations  is  close  to  the  one  that  is 
empirically  observed.  In  this  case,  the  average 
. 
fitness of published paper is, obviously

5.0=pj

The  average  fitness  of  a  reference  is  given  by 
Eq.(13), which now becomes:

of  0.1,  one  needs  to  have  a  major  genetic  disease 
like  cystic  fibrosis  (see  Ref.[19]  pp.  11-12).    In 
contrast,  it  seems  that  otherwise  healthy  genetic 
specimens  can  be  prolific  producers  of  scientific 
writings with very low fitness.

and very much relaxed cut-off of this power law. 
As  was  already  mentioned,  because  of  the 
 
uncertainty of the definition of “recent” papers, the 
exact value of ais not known.  Therefore we give

This  distribution  in  the  case  without  fitness  is

published during the same year. 
 
The  above  results  qualitatively  agree  with 
the  empirical  data  for  papers  cited  in  1961  (see 
Fig.2 of Ref.[9]) . The exponent of the power law 
of  citation  distribution  reported  in  that  work  is, 
however,  between  2.5  and  3.  Quantitative 
agreement thus may be lacking.   

 

 

IV. Effects of literature growth 
Up  to  now  we  implicitly  assumed  that  yearly 
volume  of  published  scientific  literature  does  not 
change  with  time.  In  reality,  however,  it  grows, 
and does so exponentially8. To account for this we 
introduce  a  Malthusian  parameter, b ,  which  is 
yearly percentage increase in the yearly number of 
published papers. From the data on   the number of 
items in the Mathematical Reviews Database (Ref. 
[23]), we obtain that the literature growth between 
. From 
1970 and 2000 is consistent with
the  data  on  the  number  of  source  publications  in 
the  ISI  database  (see  Table  1  of  Ref.  [10])  we  get 
that  the  literature  growth  between  1973  and  1984 
was characterized by

literature  back  in  1950s.  How  do  scientists  cope 
today? The answer might lie in Ref. [4].

growth  of  the  volume  of  scientific  literature,  but 
also increase in activities of Mathematical Reviews 
and ISI and true b must be less. One can counter-
argue  that  may  be  ISI  and  Mathematical  Reviews 
could  not  cope  with  literature  growth  and bmust 
be more. Another issue is that amount of references 
in  papers  also  grows.  What  is  important  for  our 
modeling  is  the  yearly  increase  not  in  number  of 
papers, but in the number of citations these papers 
contain. Using the ISI data we get that this increase 
is  characterized  by
.  From  the  above  it  is 
clear that we are not sure of the precise value ofb, 
so  in  the  future  we  will  be  giving  quantitative 
results for a range of its values. 
 
A. Model without fitness  
At first, we will study the effect of b in the model 
without  fitness.  Obviously,  the  Equations  (1)  and 
(2) will change into:

The estimate of the actual value of l is:

.    Substituting  this 
 
-»l
into  Equations  (7)  and  (8)  we  obtain  that  the 
exponential  cut-off  in  citation  distribution  now 
happens after about 560 citations.    
 
A  curious  observation  is  that  when  the 
volume  of  literature  grows  in  time  the  average 
amount of citations a paper receives,
citN , is bigger 
than  the  average  amount  of  references  in  a  paper, 
refN  . Elementary calculation gives:

obviously  equal  to  the  number  of  references  we 
recall  that
citN ,  as  computed  in  Eq.  (22),  is  the 
number of citations accumulated by a paper during 
its  cited  lifetime.  So  recent  papers  did  not  yet 
receive  their  share  of  citations  and  there  is  no 
contradiction again. 
 
 
B. Model with Darwinian fitness 
Taking  into  account  literature  growth  leads  to 
transformation of Equations (10) and (11)   into: 
 
+
jjbajl
)(

( )
( )
jl
 
As  far  as  the  average  fitness  of  a  reference,
rj , 
goes, b has no effect. Clearly, its only result is to 
increase  the  number  of  citations  to  all  papers 
(independent  of  their  fitness)  by  a  factor b+1
. 
rj   is still given by Eq. (15).   While, 
Therefore 
( )jl  is always less then unity in the case with no 
literature  growth,  it  is  no  longer  so  when  we  take 
this growth into account. When b is large enough, 
some papers can become supercritical. The critical 
value ofb, i.e. the value which makes papers with 
1=j critical, can be obtained from Eq.(23b): 
 
jb

supercritical.  The  rate  of  citing  them  will  increase 
with  time.      Note,  however,  that  it  will  increase 
always  slower  than  the  amount  of  published 
literature.  Therefore, 
the  relative  fraction  of 
citations  to  those  papers  to  total  number  of 
citations will decrease with time.  
Critical  values  of  b for  several  values  of

and  thus  our  model  predicts  the

It  is  not  clear  at  the  moment  whether 
supercritical papers exist in reality or are merely a 
pathological  feature  of  the  model.  Supercritical 
papers  probably  do  exist 
if  one  generalizes 
“citation” to include references to a concept, which 
originated from the paper in question. For instance, 
these days almost nobody refers to Euler’s original 
paper, when working with Euler’s Gamma function. 
It  is  very  likely  that  the  number  of  papers 
mentioning  Gamma  function  is  increasing  year 
after year.

V. Numerical simulations 
The analytical results are of limited use, as they are 
exact  only  for  infinitely  old  papers.  To  see  what 
happens  with  finitely  old  papers  one  needs  to  do 
numerical  simulations.  Figure  1  shows  resulting 
, 
from  such  simulations  (with 
and  uniform  between  0  and  1  fitness  distribution) 
citation  distribution  to  papers  published  within  a 
single  year  22  years  after  publication.  Results  are 
compared  with  actual  citation  data  for  Physical 
Review  D  papers  published  in  1975  (as  of  1997). 
The  prediction  of  the  cumulative  advantage  [5] 
(AKA  preferential  attachment  [6])  model  is  also 
shown.  As  we  mentioned  earlier,  that  model  leads 
to exponential distribution of citations to papers of 
same  age,  and  thus  can  not  account  for  highly-
skewed distribution empirically observed.

assumed distribution of fitness.

VI. Unread citations 
It  was  recently  established  [4]  that  majority  of 
scientific  citations  are  not  read  by  the  citing 
authors.  This  should  affect  citation  distribution  in 
the  model  with  fitness,  because  when  paper  is  not 
read its qualities can not affect its chance of being 
cited.  
Eq.(23a)  is  obviously  unchanged  (since  recent 
papers haven’t yet been cited, citation could not be 
copied,  so  they  had  to  be  read).  Equation  (23b) 
changes into:

citations can save us from supercritical papers. 
 
The  argument  in  the  beginning  of  this 
section,  however,  is  not  entirely  correct.  The 
fitness  of  a  paper,  apart  from  scientific  qualities, 
which  can  only  be  assessed  by  reading,  depends 
also  on  scientific  respectabilities  of  the  associated 
authors and of the journal where it was published. 
So,  perhaps,  this  section  is  only  useful  as  a 
mathematical exercise.

VII. Aging of scientific literature 
First  we  consider  the  model  without  fitness.  The 
average  number  of  citations  a  paper  receives 
during the kth year since its publication, 
kC
and thus, decreases exponentially with time. This is 
in agreement with some of the empirical data [10].  
Note,  however,  that  the  exponential  decay  is 
empirically  observed  after  second  year,  with 
average number of the second  year citations being 
higher  than  the  first  year.  This  can  be  understood 
as  a  mere  consequence  of  the  fact  that  it  takes 
about a year for a submitted paper to get published. 
 
Let  us  now  investigate  the  effect  of  fitness 
on  literature  aging.  Obviously,  Eq.  (28)  will  be 
replaced with:

The average rate of citing decays with paper’s age

[25]),  though  it  contradicts  the  older  work  [10], 
which found exponential decay of citing with time. 
 
In our model, the transition from hyperbolic

VIII. Sleeping Beauties in science  
Figure 2 shows two distinct citation histories. The 
paper,  whose  citation  history  is  shown  by  the 
squares,  is  an  ordinary  paper.  It  merely  followed 
some trend. When ten years later that trend got out 
of  fashion  the  paper  got  forgotten.  The  paper, 
whose citation history is depicted by the triangles, 
reported  an  important  discovery,  significance  of 
which  was  not  immediately  realized  by  scientific 
peers.  Only  ten  years  after  its  publication  did  the 
paper  get  recognition,  and  got  cited  widely  and 
increasingly.  Such  papers  are  called  “Sleeping 
Beauties”[26].  Surely,  the  reader  has  realized  that 
both  citation  histories  are  merely  the  outcomes  of 
numerical  simulations  of  the  modified  model  of 
random-citing scientists.

IX. Relation to Self Organized Criticality  
We  modeled  scientific  citing  as  a 
random 
branching  process.  Note,  that  in  its  mean-field 
version  Self  Organized  Criticality  (SOC)  can  also 
be  described  as  a  critical  branching  process  [27], 
[28].  Here  the  sand  grains,  which  are  moved  after 
the  original  toppling,  are  equivalent  to  sons.  This 
moved  grains can cause  further toppling,  resulting 
in the motion of more grains, which are equivalent 
to  grandsons,  and  so  on.  The  total  number  of 
displaced grains is the size of the avalanche and is 
equivalent  to  total  offspring  in  the  case  of  a 
branching  process.  Distribution  of  offspring  is 
equivalent to distribution of avalanches in SOC. 
 
Bak himself [29] had emphasized the major 
role of chance in works  of Nature: one sand  grain 
falls,  -  nothing  happens;  another  one  (identical) 
falls,  -  and  causes  an  avalanche.  Applying  these 
ideas to biological evolution, Bak argued [29] that 
no  cataclysmic  external  event  was  necessary  to 
cause a mass extinction of dinosaurs. It could have 
been caused by one of many minor external events. 
Similarly, in the model of random-citing scientists: 
one  paper  goes  unnoticed,  but  another  one 
in  merit),  causes  an  avalanche  of 
(identical

citations10. Therefore apart from explanations of 1/f 
noise,  avalanches  in  sandpiles,  and  extinction  of 
dinosaurs, 
the  highly  cited  Science  of  Self 
Organized  Criticality  can  also  account  for  its  own 
success.  

X. Conclusion 
In  the  cumulative  advantage  (AKA  preferential 
attachment)  model,  a  power  law  distribution  of 
citations  is  only  achieved  because  papers  have 
different  ages.  This  is  not  immediately  obvious 
from the early treatments of the problem ([5], [31]), 
but  is  explicit  in  later  studies  ([6],  [7]).    In  that 
model,  the  oldest  papers  are  the  most  cited  ones. 
The number of citations is mainly determined by a 
paper’s  age.  At  the  same  time  distribution  of 
citations  to  papers  of  the  same  age  is  exponential 
[7],  [8].    The  key  difference  between  that  model 
and ours is as follows. In the cumulative advantage 
model,  the  rate  of  citation  is  proportional  to  the 
number  of  citations  the  paper  had  accumulated 
since  its  publication.  In  our  model,  the  rate  of 
citation  is  proportional  to  the  number  of  citations 
the  paper  received  during  preceding  year.  This 
means  that  if  unlucky  paper  was  not  cited  during 
previous year – it will never be cited in the future.  
This means that its rate of citation will be less than 
that in a cumulative advantage model. On the other 
hand,  the  lucky  papers,  which  were  cited  during 
the previous  year, will  get all the citation share  of 
the  unlucky  papers  during  the  next  year.  Their 
citation  rates  will  be  higher  than  in  cumulative 
advantage model. There  is thus more stratification 
in  our  model  than  in  the  cumulative  advantage 
model.  As  a  consequence,  the  resulting  citation 
distribution is far more skewed. 
the  cumulative 
that 
One  can  argue 
  
advantage  model  with  multiplicative  fitness  [32] 
can explain a power-law distribution of citations to 
same-year  papers,  when  the  distribution  of  fitness 
is exponential (see Appendix B of Ref [33]). Note, 

                                                 
10 This  should  not  be  confused  with  avalanches  in 
power-law  networks  which  have  been  studied 
recently  [30].  In  the  model  of  random  citing 
scientists  the  power  law  network  of  scientific 
papers itself is a product of avalanches. 
 
 

however,  that  this  model  still  is  not  capable  of 
explaining  literature  aging.  In  the  cumulative 
advantage  model,  in  order  to  explain  literature 
aging, one has to artificially introduce some factor, 
which decays with age (so that the rate of citing is 
proportional  to  the  product  of  the  number  of 
accumulated citations and this factor)   (see Chapt. 
9.7  of  [34]).  In  contrast,  our  model  naturally 
explains how literature aging happens, and thus, it 
should be preferred. 
 

Appendix A: Elements of the theory of 
branching processes 
This  theory  was  conceived  in  the  19th  century, 
when  British  gentlemen  had  noticed  that  many 
families that had occupied conspicuous positions in 
the past became extinct. At first the conclusion was 
drawn  that  increase  in  intellectual  capacity  is 
accompanied by a decrease in fertility.  Afterwards, 
the  theory  of  branching  processes  was  developed, 
which  showed  that  a  large  proportion  of  families 
(or  surnames)  should  become  extinct  by  the 
ordinary law of chances [35].

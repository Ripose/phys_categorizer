Abstract.  Following  an  approach  proposed  by  Rosser4  for  deriving  the  transformation 
equations  of  volume  charge  density  and  current  density  we  derive  the  transformation 
equations  for  the  space-time  coordinates  of  the  same  event,  for  the  mass  and  the 
momentum of the same particle and for the electric and the magnetic field generated by 
the same distribution of electric charges. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
 
Special relativity involves two inertial reference frames K(XOY) and 
K’(X’O’Y’)  in  relative  motion.  The  corresponding  axes  of  the  two  frames 
are parallel to each other and the OX(O’X’) axes are common. At the origin 
of time (t=t’=0) the origins of the two frames O(O’) are located at the same 
point in space. K’ moves with constant speed V relative to K in the positive 
direction  of  the  common  axes.  Consider  a  physical  system  whose  physical 
properties  are  measured  by  observers  of  the  two  frames.  Any  physical 
property is characterized by a physical quantity expressed as a product of a 
numerical value and a physical unit. In the general case when measuring a 
given  quantity  the  observers  of  the  two frames  obtain different  results, say 
Φ  in K and  Φ′  in K’. The transformation equations establish a relationship 
between  Φ  and  Φ′ . We distinguish between the two possible situations: 
 

a.  The  physical  system  under  consideration  is  at  rest  relative  to  K’.  In 
this  case,  the  physical  quantities  measured  by  observers  from  K’  are 
proper physical quantities, whereas those measured by observers from 
K  are  non-proper  physical  quantities.  The  transformation  equation 
relates a proper physical quantity  Φ′  measured in K’ to a non-proper 
one  Φ  measured in K.  

b.  The physical system moves relative to both K and to K’. In this case 
the transformation equation relates two non-proper physical quantities 
Φ  and  Φ′  (Lorentz-Einstein transformations).  

 
The transformation equations of the type (a) are derived by many authors as 
particular cases of the transformation equations of the type (b). 
 
 
The postulates of special relativity and thought experiments solve the 
problem  in  the  case  (a),  resulting  in  the  transformation  equation  for 

1 

relativistic velocities.1,2,3 The purpose of our paper is to show that if the (a) 
problem  is  solved  then  the  (b)  problem  can  be  solved  following  the  same 
strategy, 
in  all  chapters  of  physics:  kinematics,  dynamics  and 
electrodynamics.  Doing  so  we  follow  a  strategy  proposed  by  Rosser4  for 
deriving the transformation equations for volume charge density and current 
density.  
 

The  scenario  we  propose  involves  the  inertial  reference  frames  K(XOY), 
K’(X’O’Y’) and K0(X0O0Y0). K0 is the inertial reference frame in which the 
physical system being studied is in a state of rest and observers of this frame 
measure  proper  physical  quantities.  The  frame  K0  moves  with  speed 
xu  
relative to K and with speed 
xu′  relative to K’, whereas K’ moves with speed 
V relative to K, all in the positive direction of the common axes. As shown 
in Figure 1 we find at rest at the origin O0 of K0 a particle of proper mass m0 
and  a  clock  C0.  Also  at  rest  along  the  O0X0  axis  we  find  a  uniform 
distribution of electric charges characterized by a linear density 0λ .

2. Relativistic kinematics 
 
 
Consider  the  situation  presented  in  Figure  2.  Figure  2a  shows  the 
relative  position  of  K0  relative  to  K  as  detected  from  K  at  a  given  time  t 
displayed  by  the  synchronized  clocks  of  K.  Figure  2b  shows  the  relative 
position of  K0 relative to K’ at a given time t’ displayed by the synchronized 
clocks of  K’.

3. Relativistic dynamics 
We consider the point-like particle located at rest at the origin O0 of 
 
the  frame  K0.  Observers  of  this  frame  measure  its  proper  (rest)  mass  m0. 
Observers  from  K  measure  its  relativistic  mass m  (we  will  show  later  how 
this  concept  can  be  avoided),  whereas  observers  from  K’  measure  its 
relativistic  mass  m’.  A  thought  experiment  that  involves  the  relativistic 
postulates and (1) and (2) shows that8

Equations (14)-(17) enable us to avoid the concept of relativistic mass  

 
which many authors prefer to avoid.9 
 
4. Aberration of light 
 
 
Thought  experiments  that  do  not  involve  light  signals  prove  the 
invariance  of  distances  measured  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  relative 
motion.10 Consider that the source of light S0 located at the origin O0 of K0 
emits a light signal at the origin of time, in the positive direction of the O0Y0 
axis. (Figure 2a). After a given time of propagation the light signal generates 
. The same event detected from the K frame (Figure

and the polar angles transform in accordance with (20). 
 
The experience gained so far teaches us that we can obtain the inverse 
transformations  by  simply  interchanging  the  corresponding  un-primed 
physical  quantities  with  primed  ones  and  changing  the  sign  of  the  relative 
velocity V.  
 
As  an  exercise  for  the  reader,  we  propose  the  derivation  of  the 
Lorentz-Einstein  transformations  for  the  space  time  coordinates  of  events

5.  Relativistic electrodynamics 
 
 
Consider  that  the  linear  electric  charge  distribution  presented  in 
Figure  1  is  at  rest  in  K0.  Observers  from  this  frame  characterize  it  by  a 
0λ .  At  a  given  point  M0(0,d)  of  the  O0Y0  axis  it 
proper  linear  density 
generates an electric field that has only a normal (proper) component given

6. Conclusions 
 
 
Generalizing the results obtained above, we can say that a equation of 
Lorentz-Einstein transformation relates a scalar physical quantity for which 
we  can  define  a  proper  value  to  a  vector  physical  quantity  which  is  the 
product of the scalar physical quantity and the velocity at which the physical 
system  characterised  by  it  moves  relative  to  the  reference  frame  being 
considered. With this the way to the concept of four vector is open.

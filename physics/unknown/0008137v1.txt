Abstract

The RFQ of the project IPHI [1] is a 8 meter long, high
power, very precise tolerances (0.01 mm on 1 meter long
for  example)  device  to  accelerate  protons.  This  RFQ  is
similar to the RFQ of the LEDA project. So, we realize a
thermal  and  mechanical  studies  followed  by  different
tests  for  machining  and  brazing  copper.  We  describe  in
this paper those different steps and the way we proceed to
supply the fabrication itself by an independent company.

1  SUBMISSION OF THE PROBLEM

consequences on the design are summarized on table 1:

vane  tip  in  transition  cold  /  hot  period.  So,  we  want  the
lowest running temperature as possible.

 The geometry is given on figure 1:

 First  stage  is  the  optimization  of  the  initial  2D  8th
section which receives the greatest power density. So we
did the following steps:

Power density issued from
Superfish.
Lowest values for water
temperature and 5 m/s for
speeds except channel 1.

Loop on v1 (Speed of
channel in the vane tip) to
obtain ∆F=0.

Correction on power density with
the real temperature

stresses and RF power.

channels, Increase of water
temperature.

So, we first do a thermal study to determine dimensions
and  positions  of  the  channels  and  optimize  the  cooling
characteristics.

Second, we design the section.
Third, we do a lot of tests to qualify the machining and

brazing procedures.

2  THERMAL STUDY

2.1  Cooling the vane.

2.1.1 – Topics

 We  search  a  correct  frequency  of  the  cavity  (+/-  50
kHz), a constant frequency all along the cavity, vanes at
the  right  position,  a  maximum  stress  below  the  yield
point.

 On another hand, it would be  more  convenient  during
running  operations  to  obtain  small  displacements  on  the

 
 Second  stage: 2D calculation of final section: We  just

verify that there is no important derive.

 Third stage: 3D calculation of the 8th sections.
 We  obtain  the  temperatures  map,  stresses  map.  We
have  also  the  evolution  of  the  vane  tip  position,  the

evolution of the bottom of the cavity, the evolution of the
frequency all along the section:

 Fourth stage: 3D: Inlet temperature of channel 1 and 2
are fixed at 10°C. We search a single inlet temperature of
channel  3,4  and  5.  In  fact  the  RFQ  will  be  regulate  by
channels of the bottom of the cavity.

 2.1.3 Results:

 The temperatures map is given on figure 1. Maximum
temperature  is  41°C  on  the  bottom.  The  vane  tip  are  at
13°C.  Von  Mieses  stresses  were  below  26  MPa,
frequency  varies  between  0  and  –50kHz  without  the
extremities. Vane tip moves less than 5 µm.

 Stresses  are  greater  in  3D  than  in  2D.  So,  we  re-

optimize the geometry.

 Inlet temperatures of channel 3,4,5 vary between 10°C
and  13°C  from  section2  (minimum)  and  section  8
(maximum).
 2.2  Segment ends

 Local RF heat is underestimated by RF simulations. P
Balleyguier  shows  at  lease  a  factor  4  on  the  power
displayed on the edges [2]. But, in fact, global values are
reliable. They give a good idea of displacements.

 Displacements  are  given  on  figure  2  where  the
maximum  is  0,07  mm  at  the  end  of  the  vane  type  (blue
color):

 

 3  COPPER

 We  are  chiefly  interested  by  grains  size  and  thermal
expansion. For the thermal expansion coefficient and the
brazing  operation,  we  need  chiefly  an  homogenous
copper in the three directions. Grains size is important to
avoid leaks.

 Properties  of  copper  are  strongly  dependent  on  its
history.  So,  we  specify  hardness,  easier  to  measure  and
equally dependent on the way to elaborate it.

 The copper specification precises this two parameters.
 Of course, we fabricate all copper in a single time. We

control the forging at the supplier.

 4  DESIGN OF THE RFQ

 The design lays upon the principles detailed in the first

paragraph and upon results of the thermal studies.

 Further,  to  determine  the  way  to  cut  the  RFQ  in
segment, in section of 1 meter long, each with four vanes:
2  majors  and  2  minors,  we  completely  reproduce  the
LEDA schedule.[3]

 We  add  stainless  steel  flange  for  metallic  linkage.
Flanges for the tuner are also in stainless steel. The output
for the cooling is reported on the copper structure.

 The  two  stages  of  brazing  are  one  for  stainless  steel

components, one for copper pieces.

 
 
 By the way, an inclined end instead of a rectangular cut
like LEDA RFQ decreases displacements of the vane tip.
 The  maximum  temperature  is  evaluated  to  80°C.  The

maximum von Mieses stress is about 80 MPa.

 
 So,  the  conclusions  for  the  design  is  to  do  smooth
edges  to  spread  the  RF  power  and  to  reduce  distance
between the channel and the end face. This work is still in
progress to be more confident on local values and reduce
temperature and stresses.

 

 Figure 3: section 1

 To align, we will use taylor balls.
 The  general  operations  of  the  fabrication  procedure  is

chronologically:

 + Drilling the channels,
 + Rough machining of the vanes,
 + Final machining of the major vanes and control,
 + Final machining of the minor vanes and control,
 + Surface treatment,
 + Assembling minor and major vanes,
 + RF tests,
 + Last machining issued from the assemble,
 +  Brazing  all  components  together  and  control

(dimensions and RF).

 5  THE DIFFERENT STEPS OF

DEVELOPMENT.

 We  have  two  topics:  first  determine  the  best  way  for
machining and brazing  (it  is  the  technical  topic),  second
to  find  a  supplier  for  these  operations  (the  commercial
purpose).So, we plan the following schedule:

 To  design  the  rough  model,  we  first  design  the

prototype and we keep the most sensible aspects.

 6  ROUGH MODEL.

 It  is  500  mm  long,  has  a  single  vane,  one  assembled

face, and reference faces to see deformations.
 Results  are:  Form  tolerance  of  the  tip  vane:  0,02  mm,
flatness  of  assembled  faces:  0,01  mm,  parallelism
between  the  assembled  face  and  the  vane  tip:  0,01  mm.
The  brazing  operation  add  a  0,01  mm  deformation.  The
drilling test gives an displacement below 0,5 mm but the
operation stays risky.
 It was the hoped values which were held by SICN. So, it
was the chosen supplier.

 7  TEST ON 1 METER LONG.

 In  fact,  we  identify  the  technical  difficulties  and
imagine a test for each one. Those tests and their results
are given on table 3.
 One  of  them  is  the  assemblage  of  stainless  steel  and
copper.  We  chose  a  brazing  solution  because  electron
beam  welding  has  been  tested  to  assemble  copper  with
too  greatest  deformations.  The  brazed  method  needs
precise  machining  tolerances  but  experience  of  precise
values were obtained for vanes.
 To  determine  the  desired  tolerance,  we  use  a  thermal
mechanical  program  called  Castem,  developed  by  CEA.
This program can simulate the elastic and plastic behavior
of materials during thermal cycles.
 
 
 

 8  PRE - PROTOTYPE.

 The pre – prototype is mechanically the same than the
prototype but we simplify it to reduce costs. For example,
 there  is  only  one  vane  tip  machined  with  the  correct
profile, holes for pumping ports are done but just one will
be brazed, few cooling holes will be drilled.

 At  the  opposite,  we  could  make  cuts  to  visualize

deformations and see the quality of the brazed junction.

 We  yet  have  roughly  machined  the  pieces.  We  still
have  to  machine  the  waved  profile  on  one  major  piece
and to braze the pre - prototype.

9  CONCLUSION.

 We  plan  to  achieve  the  pre  prototype  for  middle  of
October  2000,  fabrication  of  the  first  section  would  be
ended beginning 2001 and the RFQ in middle of 2002.

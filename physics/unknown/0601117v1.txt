Abstract 

We compare, for the overlapping time frame 1962-2000, the estimate of the northern hemisphere 

mid-latitude winter atmospheric variability within the available XX century simulations of 17 global 

climate models included in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – 4th Assessment Report 

with the NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses. We compute the Hayashi spectra of the 500hPa 

geopotential height fields and introduce an  ad hoc integral measure of the variability observed in 

the Northern Hemisphere on different spectral sub-domains. The total wave variability is taken as a 

global scalar metrics describing the overall performance of each model, while the total variability 

pertaining to the eastward propagating baroclinic waves and to the planetary waves are taken as 

scalar metrics describing the performance of each model in describing the corresponding specific 

physical process. Only two very high-resolution global climate models have a rather good agreement 

with reanalyses. Large biases, in most cases larger than 20%, are found in all the considered metrics 

between the wave climatologies of most IPCC models and the reanalyses. The span of the 

climatologies of the various models is, in all cases, around 50% of the climatology of the reanalyses. 

In particular, the travelling baroclinic waves are typically overestimated by the climate models, 

while the planetary waves are usually underestimated. This closely resembles the results of many 

diagnostic studies performed in the past on global weather forecasting models. When comparing the 

results of various versions of similar models, it appears clear that in some cases the vertical 

resolution of the atmosphere and, somewhat unexpectedly, of the adopted ocean model seem to be 

critical in determining the agreement of the climate models with the reanalyses. The models 

ensemble obtained by arithmetic averaging of the results of all models is biased with respect to the 

reanalyses but is comparable to the best 5 models. This study suggests serious caveats with respect 

to the ability of mo st of the presently available climate models in  representing the statistical 

properties of the global scale atmospheric dynamics of the present climate and, a fortiori, in the 

perspective of modelling climate change.

1. Introduction 

The climate system  is  multi-component  as  well  as  highly  non- linear: the task of 

planning  practical  strategies  for  improving  numerical  climate  models  is  a 

tantalizing  one.  The  Project  for  Climate  Model  Diagnostics  and  Intercomparison 

(PCMDI  http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov)  has  supported  the  gathering  into  a  single 

location  of  climate  model  outputs  contributing  to  the  activities  initiated  by  the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The PCMDI thus provides a 

unique opportunity for evaluating the state-of-the-art capabilities  in simulating the 

behaviour of  climate system. 

In particular, the improvement of diagnostic tools employed in modelling studies 

and the provision of simple scalar metrics of model performances is solicited by the 

PCMDI.  Examples  of    scalar  metrics  are  shown  in  the  IPCC-Third  Assessment 

Report  (hereafter  TAR),  chapter  8,  in  the  form  of  correlations  between  observed 

and simulated quantities,  relative amplitude of observed and simulated variations, 

or simply the integrals of large scale quantities. 

Most  of  the  above  mentioned  metrics  are  useful  for  defining  the  overall  model 

skill in simulating fields of common practical interest in the present climate, such as 

the surface air temperature or the accumulated precipitation. However, the fields in 

questions concern quantities that can hardly be considered  climate state variables. 

By  considering  the  vertical  profile  of  the  annual  and  global  mean  temperature 

(TAR,  figure  8.8),  the  zonal  mean  surface  air  temperature  (TAR,  figure  8.2)  or 

precipitation (TAR, figure 8.3), the impression is that all models have very similar 

performances and it is very difficult to assess whether a model is performing in any 

sense better than any other. Nevertheless, they differ substantially in the horizontal 

as well as vertical resolution, numerical schemes, physical parameterizations and so 

on.  

3 

If, instead of immediately checking how realistic – from the final user’s point of 

view - the modelled fields of practical interest are, the aim  is to plan strategies for 

model  improvement,  it  is  important  to  fully  understand  the  differences  in  the 

representation of the  climatic machine among models and possibly decide whether 

specific physical processes - typically related to energy/mass transport and energy 

conversion - are correctly simulated by a specific numerical model. In this context, 

a  relevant  example  of  a  soundly-based  studies  are  the  atmospheric  GCMs 

intercomparison on the representation of the hydrologic cycle performed by Lau et 

al.  (1996)  and  the  comparison  of  observed  and  simulated  processes  for  the 

generation of atmospheric available potential energy (Siegmund, 1995). 

The  comparison  of  bulk  thermodynamic  quantities  defining  the  climate  state, 

such  as  the  tropospheric  average  temperature,  tropospheric  average  specific 

humidity,  variance  of  geopotential  height,  allows  the  definition  of  global  metrics 

which  may  be  considered  as  robust  diagnostic  tools.  Nevertheless,  such  approach 

does not allow for the disentanglement of the role of each one of the vast range of 

distinct physical processes contributing to the global balances. 

In  order  to  capture  the  differences  in  the  representation  of  specific  physical 

processes,  it  is  necessary  to  use  specialized  diagnostic  tools  -  that  we  may  call 

process-oriented metrics - as indexes for model reliability. Such approach may be 

helpful  in  clarifying  the  distinction  between  the  performance  of  the  models  in 

reproducing  diagnostic  and  prognostic  variables  of  the  atmospheric  system. 

Moreover, such approach  would  allow  to  highlight  discrepancies  in  the  statistical 

properties of the various terms contributing to the derivatives of the fields. 

The 500hPa geopotential-height has an immediate application as a visualization 

tool  for  the  organization  of  large  scale  winds,  which  are  basically  in  geostrophic 

balance.  However,  it  carries  also  important  dynamical  information.  Theoretical  as 

4 

well  as  observational  arguments  suggest  that  the  500hPa  geopotential- height  can 

be  taken  as  a  key  variable  for  describing  atmosphe ric  process  both  in  the  Low-

Frequency  Low-Wavenumber 

  (LFLW)  and  in  the  High-Frequency  High-

Wavenumber  (HFHW)  region  of  the  full  spectrum  of  variability.  HFHW 

phenomena  comprise  the  synoptic  travelling  waves  characterized  by  period  of  the 

order  2-7  days,  by  spatial  scales  of  the  order  of  few  thousands  kilometres,  and 

which can be associated with the release of available energy driven by conventional 

baroclinic  conversion  (Blackmon  1976;  Speranza  1983;  Wallace  et  al.  1988),  so 

that they are often referred to as baroclinic waves. LFLW phenomena comprise the 

lower  frequency  variability  (period  of  the  order  of  10-45  days),  mostly  due  to  the 

dynamics  of  long  stationary  waves,  interacting  with  orography  (Charney  and 

DeVore 1979; Charney and Straus 1980; Buzzi et al. 1984; Benzi et al. 1986) and 

being  catalyzed  by  the  sub-tropical  jet  (Benzi  and  Speranza,  1989;  Ruti  et  al., 

2006).  Both  the  baroclinic  and  planetary  waves  provide  a  relevant  contribution  to 

the  meridional  transport  of  energy  and  momentum  (Speranza,  1983;  Peixoto  and 

Oort,  1992).  In  a  previous  study  (Dell’Aquila  et  al.,  2005)  we  have  compared  the 

mid- latitude atmospheric variability in the northern hemisphere as described in two 

different  reanalysis  products.  By  performing  a  space-time  spectral  analysis 

(Hayashi, 1971, 1979) of the 500hPa geopotential height variability we were able to 

identify  slight  discrepancies  in  the  description  of  the  standing  and  propagating 

components  of  the  total  wave  spectrum,  due  to  differences  in  the  observational 

basis as well as in the operational model formulations. 

The  operational  global  weather  forecasting  models  routinely  used  in  the  ‘80s, 

which  constitute  in  many  cases  the  baselines  of  the  atmospheric  components 

presently  adopted  in  up-to-date  global  climate  models  (for  a  brief  history  of 

atmospheric modelling, see  http://www.aip.org/history/sloan/gcm/intro.html), were 

5 

well-known  to  suffer  from  serious  biases  both  in  the  LFLW  and  HFHW 

atmospheric variability domains (Tibaldi, 1986). In particular, it was confirmed in a 

number of studies that such models on the average featured a large overestimation 

of  the  baroclinic  waves  (e.g.  Sumi  and  Kanamitsu,  1984;  Klinker  and  Capaldo., 

1986,  Siegmund  1995)  and  a  large  underestimation  of  the  planetary  waves  (e.g. 

Wallace  et  al.,  1983),  with  biases  sometimes  of  the  same  size  as  the  average 

climatology  of  the  observations  and  analyzed  atmospheric  fields.  Similar  biases 

have  been  identified  also  on  climate  models  such  as  ECHAM  3  (Kaurola,  1996). 

Whereas  such  biases  have  a  relatively  minor  impact  on  reanalyses,  since 

observation are used to correct the autonomous evolution of the atmospheric model, 

they  may  be  critical  on  unconstrained  models,  and  may  hinder  the  significance  of 

the resulting simulations of past and future climatic conditions, with special regard 

to the mid- latitudes.  

In  view  of  the  above  mentioned  remarks,  in  this  study  we  consider  17 global 

climate models that will contribute to the scientific basis of the Intergovernmental 

Panel  on  Climate  Change  4th  Assessment  Report  (henceforth,  IPCC-4AR)  and 

perform  an  intercomparison  study  focusing  on  the  mid- latitudes  baroclinic  and 

planetary  waves,  Moreover,  we  compare  the  statistics  of  the  climate  models  with 

those  of  the  NCEP-NCAR  and  ECMWF  global  reanalyses.  To  accomplish  such  a 

goal, we construct two different kinds of model metrics. The scope is to supplement 

the  use  of  global  metrics,  describing  the  spectral  properties  of  all  sorts  of 

atmospheric  disturbances,  which  may  average  out  the  compensating  effect  of 

different physical processes, with a process-oriented metrics whose goal is to assess 

the  model  capability  of  correctly  describing  in  detail  a  given  climatic  processes. 

Therefore,  we introduce an  ad hoc  integral  measure  of  the  variability  observed  in 

the  Northern  Hemisphere  on  different  spectral  sub-domains.  The  total  wave 

6 

variability is taken as a global scalar metrics describing the overall performance of 

each  model,  while  the  total  variability  pertaining  to  the  eastward  propagating 

baroclinic waves and to the planetary waves are taken as scalar metrics describing 

the performance of each model in describing the HFHW variability and the  LFLW 

variability, respectively. We maintain that such tests critically address the reliability 

of the considered models in the simulation of structurally major climatic processes.  

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  section  2  we  describe  the  considered 

datasets and sketch the method employed for analysis. In section 3 we compare the 

model  performances  in  specific  sub-regions  of  the  full  space-temporal  spectrum; 

the conclusions are drawn in section 4. 

2. Data and methods 

The IPCC models considered in this study are listed in table 1 along with their 

main features. Although the  analysis is performed on an atmospheric variable, we 

report  also  a  few  details  about  the  ocean  component  in  order  to  stress  that  the 

results  are  representative  of  the  response  of  a  complex  system  (say  non- linear) 

which  can  not  be  reduced  to  the  behaviour  of  its  single  components  (Lucarini, 

2002). Indeed, in some cases (for example, the GISS model), the same atmosphere 

over  different  oceans  results  into  substantially  different  atmospheric  variability.  

The  time  frame  considered  is  1962-2000. For this period  a  control  simulation  has 

been performed by all IPCC models, imposing the observed concentration of trace 

gases, such as  CO2 and ozone. 

The  IPCC  models  output  is  compared  with  observations  by  considering  two 

major  reanalysis  datasets:  the  reanalysis  produced  by  the  National  Center  for 

Environmental  Prediction  (NCEP),  in  collaboration  with  the  National  Center  for 

Atmospheric  Research  (NCAR)  (Kistler  et  al.  2001),  and  one  released  by  the 

European  Center  for  Mid-Range  Weather  Forecast  (ECMWF)  (Simmons  and 

7 

Gibson  2000).  The  resulting  common  period  for  all  datasets  is  1962-2000, which 

then results to be the time- frame we focus on in this work.  

2.1 Geostrophic Approximation and Latitudinal Averaging 

Since  the  goal  of  this  study  is  to  diagnose  the  mid- latitude  winter  atmospheric 

variability  of  the  considered  climate  models,  along  the  lines  of  Dell’Aquila  et  al. 

(2005),  we  should  use  the  December-January-February  (DJF)  daily  values  of 

geopotential  height  at  500hPa  data  averaged  over  the  latitudinal  belt  30(cid:176) N-75(cid:176) N, 

where the bulk of mid-latitude atmospheric waves activity is observed (Blackmon, 

1976; Speranza, 1983).  

Unfortunately, this field is not one of the standard daily 3D field outputs for the 

IPCC  models,  which  comprises  only  zonal  and  meridional  wind  speed,  air 

temperature  and  specific  humidity.  In  principle,  the  geopotential  height  could  be 

rigorously computed from  temperature and specific humidity  using  the  hydrostatic 

relations  and  the  equation  of  state    for  air.  Such  an  approach  requires,  however, 

knowledge of two time varying 3D fields (temperature and specific humidity) and 

of  boundary  terms  such  as  the  constant  2D  field  of  surface  height  and  the  time-

varying 2D field  of surface pressure. The latter field  is  not  readily  available  in the 

IPCC-4AR dataset,  but could be reconstructed with suitable interpolations from the 

available sea- level pressure data.  

In view of the large computational resources needed and the uncertainties on the 

surface  boundary  term,  we  have  instead  retrieved  the  500  hPa  meridional  wind 

speed.  In  fact,  in  the  geostrophic  approximation,  the  meridional  wind  is  related  to 

the zonal gradient of the geopotential height by:

simple model- independent implementation, and is local in the sense that is involves 

only  the  relevant  p=500hPa  level.  Of  course  the  geostrophic  relation  is  only  an 

approximation  at  order  Rossby  number

in  our  case) 

approximation,  but  is  well  suited  for  the  mid- latitudes  (Peixoto  and  Oort,  1992; 

Holton, 1992), where we restrict our analysis. Moreover, the geostrophic relations 

provide the dyna mical content of the geopotential height field: this is just the reason 

why  the  geopotential  height  is  chosen  in  this  and  previous  spectral  studies  of  the 

mid- latitude atmospheric variability, so that  such an approach is consistent with the 

We can then obtain the following relation between the longitudinal derivative of

2.2 Hayashi spectra 

The variability of the one dimensional field  in terms of waves of different periods 

and  zonal  wavenumbers  can  be  effectively  described  by  means  of  the  space-time 

Fourier  decomposition  introduced  by  Hayashi  (1971,  1979).  By  computing  the 

cross-spectra and the coherence of the signal, the method allows for a separation of 

propagating and the standing components of the atmospheric waves. 

Straightforward space-time decomposition will not distinguish between standing 

and travelling waves: a standing wave will give two spectral peaks corresponding to 

travelling  waves  moving  eastward  and  westward  at  the  same  speed  and  with  the 

same  phase.  The  problem  can  only  be  circumvented  by  making  assumptions 

regarding  the  nature  of  the  wave.  One  approach  relies  in  attributing  complete 

coherence between the eastward and westward components of standing waves and 

on attributing the incoherent part of the spectra to real travelling waves (Pratt, 1976, 

Fraedrich and Bottger, 1978; Hayashi,1979). 

In  this  formulation,  for  each  winter  considered,  it  is  possible  to  express  the 

quantity 

(

 in terms of the its zonal Fourier harmonic components as:

It  is  possible  to  test  the  reliability  of  the  Hayashi  spectra  of  the  reconstructed 

geopotential  height  and  to  estimate  the  essentially  model- independent  biases 

introduced by the geostrophic approximation by including in this study the analysis 

of the variability of the readily available 500hPa geopotential height of the NCEP-

NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses, thoroughly studied in Dell’Aquila et al. (2005). 

3. Results  

The  space-time  spectra  is  computed  for  each  of  the  39  winters  included  in  our 

datasets. Fig. 1a-d  show  the  various components of the 39-winters averages of the 

spectra  as  computed  from  the  geostrophically  reconstructed  500  hPa  geopotential 

height  for  the  NCEP  reanalysis  dataset  averaged  over  the  latitudinal  band  30°N-

75°N. Fig. 1a shows the total power spectrum;  Fig. 1b shows the power spectrum 

related  to  standing  waves;  Fig.  1c  shows    the  power  spectrum  related  to  eastward 

propagating  waves;  Fig.  1d  shows  the  spectrum  of  the  westward  propagating 

waves.  

  For comparison, we show in Fig. 2 the Hayashi spectra computed with the actual 

500  hPa  geopotential  height  for  the  NCEP  reanalysis  dataset  averaged  over  the 

latitudinal  band  30°N-75°N,  already  shown  and  discussed  in  Dell’Aquila  et  al. 

(2005). Visual inspection shows that the results are rather similar to what presented

with  the  geostrophically  reconstructed  field.  Nevertheless,  we  notice  that  the 

Hayashi  spectra  of  the  actual  500hPa  (Fig.  2)  have  consistently  slightly  higher 

values  (about  10%)  than  those  computed  with  the  reconstructed  field,  thus 

suggesting  that  the  geostrophic  reconstruction  filters  out  some  atmospheric 

variability,  as  to  be  reasonably  expected.  We  obtain  similar  results 

  by 

reconstructing geopotential height field from ERA40 reanalysis (not shown). 

  Since  the  effects  of  geostrophic  approximation  can  be  safely  considered  as 

essentially model- independent, we can then assume the correctness of our approach 

and consider the Hayashi spectra of the latitudinally averaged and geostrophically 

reconstructed  500  hPa  geopotential  height  fields  of  the  various  models  as  good 

proxies for the spectra of the exact fields. 

  The  Hayashi  spectra  of  the  considered    IPCC  models  reported  in  Table  1  are 

presented in Figs. 3-6. All models spectra are, after visual inspection, qualitatively 

similar to those of the NCEP and ERA40 datasets.  In particular, a large portion of 

the total variance is concentrated in the low frequency  – low wavenumber domain, 

and  can  be  related  mostly  to  standing  waves  and  to  westward  propagating  waves. 

The high frequency  – high wavenumber domain, corresponding mainly to synoptic 

disturbances,  contains  a  smaller  portion  of  the  total  variance,  and  is  related  to 

eastward propagating waves. 

  Nevertheless,  it  is  clear  that  many  models  seriously  underestimate  the  power 

spectrum  of  the  atmospheric  signal  at  most  time  and  space  scales,  such  as  the 

CGCM3.1  (T42),  the  CNRM-CM3,  the  CSIRO-Mk3.0,  the  ECHO-G,  the  entire 

family of GISS GCMs, the MRI-CGCM2.3.2. It is clear that such models provide a 

particularly  serious  underestimate  for  the  standing  and  westward  propagating 

waves.  On  the  contrary,  some  other  models,  such  as  ECHAM5/MPI-OM  and 

14 

FGOALS- g1.0  tend  to  overestimate  the  atmospheric  variability  at  all  scales,  and 

provide a more extreme overestimate of the eastward propagating waves.  

  Another  serious 

issue  concerning 

the  performances  of 

the  atmospheric 

components of climate models is their ability of describing the statistic of standing 

waves.  In  fact,  planetary  standing  waves  are  a  major  feature  of  mid-latitude 

atmospheric  dynamics  in  the  northern  hemisphere,  where  ultra- long  waves  may 

resonate  with  topography  (Charney  and  DeVore  1979).  However,  this  feature 

appears to be very hard to be captured by most of the models considered here. As 

shown in Fig. 5, a well defined spectral peak is present at wave number 3 and period 

of about 20 days for both reanalyses. Instead, most of the considered models exhibit 

either  very  broad  peaks  in  the  low  frequency- low  wavenumber  region  of  the  full 

spectrum (CGCM3.1(T42), CGCM3.1(T63), CNRM, ECHO-G, FGOALS, GFDL-

CM2.1, GISS-ER), or the peak is in the wrong position (GFDL-CM2.0, GISS-EH, 

INM-CM3.0),  or  multiple  peaks  exist  (CSIRO-Mk3.0,  ECHAM5/MPI-OM).  The 

only  examples  of  models  that  correctly  describe  this  aspect  of  mid-latitude 

atmospheric variability are the IPSL-CM4 and MIROC models. 

 

It is clear that visual inspection of the Hayashi spectra, though instructive, is not 

a very efficient way for objectively evaluating the model’s performances. We then 

try to summarize the most relevant information contained in the panels showing the 

Hayashi  spectra  into  a  few  numbers  that  can  be  more  easily  employed  to 

characterize  the  skill  of  each  model.  We  next  compare  to  different  approaches  by 

measuring  the  overall  performance  of  each  models  at  all  time  and  space  scales 

(global metrics) and the ability of the models in reproducing the correct features of 

the baroclinic and planetary waves (process oriented metrics). 

15 

3.1 Global metrics 

A  global  scalar  metrics  can  be  introduced  by  integrating  the  whole  space-time 

power spectrum corresponding to each one of the 39 considered winter seasons. We 

then consider the quantity 

 introduced in equation (12) where O is set to be 

(
Wn
TE

)

the  full  frequency-wavenumber  domain  and  n  is  the  index  running  over  the 

considered winters. 

In Fig.  7  we  show  for  all  the  considered  datasets  the  climatological  average 

(

TE

)

of  the  integral  of  the  full  spectrum  versus  its  interannual  variability

TEs

(

, 

)

estimated according to equations (13) and (14), respectively. In this scatter diagram 

the  abscissas  represent  the  model  average  intra-seasonal  variability,  while  the 

ordinates  represent 

the 

interannual  variability  of 

the  model 

intra-seasonal 

variability.  The  models  ensemble  average  is  also  shown.  Such  scatter  diagram 

allows  a  complete  visual  representation  of  a  given  climate  by  reporting  the  two 

most relevant statistical moments of any chosen variable.  

The  reconstructed    latitudinally  averaged  500  hPa  geopotential  height  fields  of 

the  two  reanalyses  have  similar  intra-seasonal  variability  and  slightly  different 

interannual  variability  mainly  because  of  the  discrepancies  in  the  pre-satellite 

period. In fact, it has been shown in Dell’Aquila et al. (2005) that in the pre-satellite 

period  a  bias  between 

the 

two  reanalyses  exists,  with  ERA40  featuring 

systematically  larger  variability  of  the  high  frequency- high  wavenumber  eastward 

propagating  waves.  If  we  consider  the  observed  fields  (here  not  shown),  in 

agreement with what hinted from the visual inspection of the Hayashi spectra, we 

have that in both cases the intraseasonal and interannual atmospheric variability  is 

increased  by  a  constant  factor  around  10%,  which  proves  that  the  geostrophic 

16 

W
W
approximations acts as a filter having an overall gain smaller than 1. The robustness 

of our approach is then confirmed.  

(

TE

)

(

TE

)

Apparently, if we consider the model ensemble, we have a good agreement with 

observations.  Both  reanalyses  lie  well  within  one  standard  deviation  from  the 

ensemble average (center of the ellipses in Fig. 7). However, the models are widely 

spread  over  the  plane  space  spanned  by  the  two  variables,  with  a  typical  bias  of 

about  15%  with  respect  to  the  reanalyses.  In  particular,  considering  the  biases  on 

the  quantity 

,  and  considering 

that 

the  standard  deviation  of 

the 

climatological mean 

 can be approximated as 

s

(

s

(

T

, since 

)

the  winters  are  weakly  dependent,  we  have  that  very  few  models  are  statistically 

consistent with the reanalyses with a reasonable significance.  

In  this  sense,  the  best  models  are  by  far  the  high- resolution  version  of  the 

MIROC  and  the  GFDL-CM2.1.  The  T62  version  of  the  CGCM3.2  and  the 

relatively  low-resolution  INM3.0  also  perform  well,  featuring  a  slightly  too  large 

intraseasonal  variability  and  too  low  interannual  variability,  respectively.  Some 

models,  such  FGOALS1.0  and  ECHAM5/MPI-OM,  feature  a  very  large  positive 

biases  ranging  over  20%  for  the  interannual  and  intraseasonal  variability.  Some 

other  models, usually of  relatively low-resolution, such as CNRM-CM3 GISS-ER, 

ECHO-G and MRI-CGCM2.3.2, feature over 20% negative biases. In general, the 

biases  on  the  intraseasonal  and  interannual  variability  are  positively  linearly 

correlated:  for  larger  average  signals  the  variability  tend  to  be  larger,  so  that  the 

model spread in Fig. 7 is definitely not isotropic.  

In  some  cases,  it  is  possible  to  track  the  improvements  occurring  between 

different  versions  or  set- ups  of  the  same  climate  model.  Thus,  e.g.,  the  GISS-EH 

model  (which  includes  an  isopycnal  ocean  component)  has  a  better  representation 

of    the  intra-seasonal  atmospheric  with  respect  to  the  GISS-ER  which  has  a  z-

coordinate  ocean  model.  However,  the  two  models  have  considerably  different 

interannual  variability,  which  is  in  both  cases  different  from that of the reanalysis. 

The  CGCM3.1  model  is  presented  in  two  versions  which  are  identical  except  for 

the  horizontal  resolution  (T47,  corresponding  to  about  3.75°  resolution,  and  T63 

corresponding  to  about  2.8°  resolution).  The  CGCM3.1(T63)  improves  the 

representation  of  both  the  intra-seasonal  variability  and  of  the  interannual 

variability  with  respect  to  CGCM3.1(T47).  Similar  improvements  are  observed 

between  MIROC(hires)  and  MIROC(medres)  and  between  GFDL-CM2.1  and 

GFDL-CM2.0.  The  MIROC  model  is  presented  with  two  different  horizontal  as 

well  as  vertical  resolution  (T42L20  for  the  medres  version  and  T106L56  for  the 

hires  version).  The  medres version shows already quite good performances and is 

among  the  best  models.  However,  a  substantial  improvement  is  observed  when 

switching  to  higher  resolution.  The  GFDL-CM2.0  and  GFDL-CM2.1  models  are 

very  similar.  In  particular  they  share  the  same  horizontal  as  well  as  vertical 

resolution,  but  in  the  GFDL-CM2.1  model  some  numerical  techniques  are 

improved with respect to GFDL-CM2.0. For example, the horizontal in CM2.0 uses 

centered  spatial  differencing,  whereas  in  CM2.1  the  horizontal  discretization  is 

performed  with  a  flux- form  semi- Lagrangian method.  Finally,  let  us  note  that  the 

models  with  a  better  representatio n  of  intraseasonal  and  interannual  variability 

display also the most realistic ENSO variability as shown in Van Oldenburg et al. 

(2005). 

3.2 Process-oriented metrics 

In  order  to  construct  a  process-oriented  metrics  pointing  at  the  diagnostics  of 

specific  physical  processes,  we  consider  a  suitable  decomposition  of  the  whole 

frequency-wave number domain. Following Dell’Aquila et al. (2005), we  consider 

18 

two spectral subdomains: the LFLW subdomain, which includes periods from 10 to 

45  days  (

)  and  zonal  wavenumbers 

2

  (length  scales  larger  than 

7000Km);  the  HFHW  subdomain,  which  includes  periods  from  2  to  7  days 

(

13

£ m

36

)  and  zonal  wavenumbers 

  (length  scales  ranging  from  a  few 

6‡j

hundreds  of  kilometres  to  5000Km).  For  each  year  of  a  given  dataset,  we  then 

provide  a  bulk  measure  of  the  planetary  standing  waves  and  of  the  eastward 

propagating baroclinic waves by

(12), respectively, where the two O-domains are prescribed as above, n is the index 

of  the  winters,  and  the  lower  indexes  S  and  E  refer  to  standing  and  eastward 

propagating components, respectively. The quantities

 and

HFHW

can  then  be  used  to  characterize  the  capabilities  of  each  model  of  correctly 

describing two specific physical processes of the atmosphere having wave nature. 

We focus on  the average (climatological) description  provided by each model of 

the planetary standing waves and of the baroclinic eastward propagating waves and 

keep slightly aside the problem of checking the correctness in the description of the 

interannual  variability  of  the  two  signals.  We  then  consider  for  each  model  the 

quantities 

(

  and   

(

  with  the  corresponding  standard  error 

estimated  as  expressed  as

,  respectively.  This 

entails assuming a weak time- lagged correlation between the 39 winter seasons  for 

the two signals in each model, which is correct in the first approximation. 

In  Fig.  8  we  show  for  all  the  considered  datasets  the  climatological  average

directions  the  corresponding  standard  error.  When  considering  the  ERA40  and 

NCEP  renalayses  datasets,  we  observe  that  the  two  reanalyses  are  very  close  to 

each  other  and  they  could  be  brought  to  a  closer  agreement  by  dropping  the  pre-

satellite period (Dell’Aquila et al., 2005). However, the discrepancies among IPCC 

models  by  far  exceed  the  discrepancies  between  the  two  different  dynamical 

interpolations of the available observations. 

In particular, with this process oriented metrics, the agreement with observations 

seems  weaker  than  with  the  global  metrics,  with  the  two  reanalysis  lying  at  just 

about  one  standard  deviation  from  the  ensemble  average.  It  is  then  important  to 

stress that with the  global  metrics, the errors originating in different regions of the 

spectrum may  average out and hide major model deficiencies. Instead, in with the 

process oriented metrics, it is easier to bring the model’s biases into light. 

For  example,  a  general  (with  very  few  exceptions)  occurrence  for  all  IPCC 

models  is  that  they  overestimate  the  variability  in  the  HFHW  subdomain. 

Regarding  the  LFLW  subdomain,  more 

than  half  of  the  models  tend  to 

underestimate  the  corresponding  variability.  As  an  overall  result,  the  model 

ensemble (center of the ellipses in Fig.  8) overestimates the HFHW variability and 

underestimates  the  LFLW  variability.  This  closely  resembles  the  results  of  many 

diagnostic  studies  performed  in  the  past  on  global  weather  forecasting  models 

(Tibaldi,  1986),  which  constitute  the  ancestors  of  the  atmospheric  components  of 

the considered climate models. 

Moreover, if we consider the standard deviation of the climatological means we 

again have that very few models are statistically consistent with the reanalyses with 

a  reasonable  significance.  The  models  that  are  closer  to  the  reanalyses  are  the 

MIROC(hires)  model  and  the  GFDL2.1  model.  In  these  two  cases,  the  error  bars 

have some overlap with the area defined by the error bars of the NCEP and ERA40 

reanalyses.  By  using  this  metrics,  the  models  that  appear  to  have  the  worst 

performances  are  the  CNRM-CM3  model,  which  underestimates  both  the  low 

20 

frequency  and  the  high  frequency,  and  the  FGOALS  model,  which  overestimates 

the variability in both spectral sub-domains. 

Unfortunately,  there  is  no  unique  way  to  attribute  the  biases  of  LFLW  and 

HFHW  variability  to  specific  features  that  are  common  to  a  class  of  models. 

Instead,  there  are  cases  in  which  different  versions  of  the  same  model  show 

different behaviour in this spectral subdomain. We refer to the  CGCM3.1-T47 and 

CGCM3.1-T63 models, which differ for the horizontal resolution, and the GISS-EH 

and GISS-ER  models, which share the same atmospheric component over different 

ocean  models.  Therefore,  it  is  interesting  to  compare  the  relative  changes  in  the 

performances of models presented with different configuration. This might help in 

the identification of specific strategies for model improvements. 

  In  the  case  of  the  CGCM3.1  models,  an  increased  horizontal  resolution  (T63) 

leads  to  a  better  statistics  of  planetary-scale  standing  waves.  However,  the 

performance  on  small  scale  disturbances  is  better  in  the  low  resolution  version 

(T47). Thus, increasing the horizontal resolution alone leads to no automatic overall 

substantial improvement of  the model performance. 

As  mentioned  above,  the  two  versions  of  the  GISS  model  share  the  same 

atmosphere  component  over  different  oceans.  In  this  case,  the  use  of  vertical 

density  coordinates  (GISS-EH)  appears  to  improve  the  statistics  of  the  standing 

waves  which  is  too  low  in  the  case  of  z-coordinates  (GISS-ER).  Instead,  the 

performance in on eastward propagating waves is worse. 

In the case of the MIROC model, increased resolution alone improves the model 

performances.  However,  unlike  with  the  CGCM3.1  models,  in  this  case  both  the 

horizontal and the vertical resolution is increased. 

Also  in  the  context  of  process-oriented  metrics,  the  improvement  from  GFDL-

CM2.0  to  GFDL-CM2.1  is  substantial,  with  the  latter  in  good  agreement  with  the 

21 

reanalyses. The experience with the GFDL models demonstrates how the increase 

of  computer  power  (i.e.  of  resolution)  may  not  be  the  only  pathway  to  model 

improvements.  Instead,  the  study  of  more  accurate  discretization  techniques    may   

give a substantial contribution. 

4. Conclusions 

The  goal  of  this  study  is  the  evaluation  of  the  degree  of  realism  and  of  mutual 

coherence  of  some  of  the  most  well-known  GCMs  in  the  description  of  statistical 

properties  of  the  atmospheric  disturbances  in  the  free  atmosphere  in  the  present 

climate.  We  maintain  that  such  analysis  is  more  insightful  into  the  real 

performances of the GCMs than the comparison of essentially boundary properties 

such as surface temperature, because the internal mechanisms of the atmosphere are 

here taken into consideration.  

We  have  considered  the  variability  of  the  500hPa  geopotential  height  field,  as 

described in the NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses for the time frame 1962-2000 and in 

the XX century control run of the IPCC GCMs. We compute the Hayashi spectra of 

the 500hPa geopotential height fields and introduce an  ad hoc  integral  measure of 

the  variability  observed  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  on  different  spectral  sub-

domains.  The  total  wave  variability  is  taken  as  a  global  metrics  describing  the 

overall  performance  of  each  model,  while  the  total  variability  pertaining  to  the 

eastward  propagating  baroclinic  waves  and  to  the  standing  planetary  waves, 

respectively are taken as  process-oriented  metrics,  aimed  at  measuring  the  model 

capability of describing the corresponding physical process.  

In  such  a  context,  we  obtain  the  striking  result  that  large  biases,  in  most  cases 

larger  than  10%,  are  found  in  all  the  considered  metrics  between  the  atmospheric 

waves  climatology  of  most  IPCC  models  and  the  reanalyses.  The  span  of  the 

22 

climatologies of the various models is in all cases around 50% of the climatology of 

the  reanalyses.  In  particular,  when  considering  the  total  variability  of  the  wave 

fields  of  the  GCMs,  we  have  that  the  biases  on  the  intraseasonal  and  interannual 

variability  are  positively  linearly  correlated:  for  larger  average  signals  the 

variability  tend  to  be  larger.  When  considering  the  process-oriented  metrics,  we 

have that  the  baroclinic  waves  are  typically  overestimated  by  the  climate  models, 

while  the  planetary  waves  are  usually  underestimated.  This  closely  resembles  the 

results  of  many  diagnostic  studies  performed  in  the  past  on  global  weather 

forecasting  models (Tibaldi, 1986). The climatologies of the wave activity  of only 

two models  –  GFDL-CM2.1 and MIROC(hires)  -  are  statistically  consistent  with 

that  of  the  reanalyses  both  for  the  global  and  process-oriented  metrics.  This  is  a 

rather surprising result, given that all models are expected to provide very similar 

vertical  temperature  profiles,  average  surface  temperature,  precipitation  and  so  on 

(see e.g. the results presented in the TAR). 

Nevertheless, the general pictures obtained with the global and with the process-

oriented  metrics,  are  substantially  different.  In  particular  the  apparent  substantial 

improvement detected in the global metrics (as in the case of the CGCM3.1 model) 

may indeed mask the loss of performance in describing a specific process. Also, the 

INM-CM3.0  model,  which  seems  rather  close  to  observations  with  the  global 

metrics,  fails  to  describe  correctly  all  regions  of  the  spectrum  of  atmospheric 

variability  at  mid- latitudes.  On  the  other  hand,  the  process-oriented  metrics may 

suggest  some  of  the  priorities  for  planning  strategies  for  model  improvements.  In 

this  perspective,  we  found  that  the  increase  of  horizontal  resolution  alone  has  no 

substantial  effect  on  model  performances  while  the  increase  of  horizontal  and 

vertical  resolution  brings  the  MIROC(hires)  model  into  close  agreement  with 

observations.  An  increased  vertical  resolution  could  be  useful  to  better  mimic  the 

23 

vertical  structure  of  the  ultra-long  waves,  in  particular  the  orographic  baroclinic 

standing perturbations (Buzzi et al. 1984).  The improvement of numerical scheme 

has  also  a  positive  impact  on  model  performances  (GFDL  models).  In  particular, 

the use of semi- lagrangian  advection  schemes  for  tracers seems to be an important 

requirement for model reliability. Somewhat unexpectedly, in the case of the GISS-

ER  and  GISS-EH  models,  the  characteristics  of  the  adopted  ocean  model  also 

seems to be critical in determining the agreement with the reanalyses. Among the 

three  GISS  models,  the  GISS-AOM  seems  to  have  superior  performances.  The 

models  ensemble  obtained  by  arithmetic  averaging  of  the  results  of  all  models  is 

biased with respect to the reanalyses but is comparable to the best 5 models.  

This  study  suggests  a  serious  caveat  concerning  the  ability  of  most  of  the 

presently  available  climate  models  in  describing  the  statistical  properties  of  the 

global  scale  atmospheric  dynamics  of  the  present  climate,  and,  a  fortiori,  in  the 

perspective of climate change. One of the possible outcomes of this study may be 

the  provision  of  quantitative  information  needed  to  weight  model  reliability  when 

considering models ensemble results, e.g., in the context of the IPCC reports. 

On the other hand, the GFDL-CM2.1 and MIROC(hires) models, being able to 

reproduce with some degree of confidence the statistical properties of wave activity 

in  the  atmosphere,  seem  to  be  the  best  candidates  for  more  detailed  studies  on 

atmospheric  circulation  regimes  (Ruti  et  al.,  2006),  which  will  be  the  subject  of 

future study. Among the several other in-depth analyses which can follow up from 

the results presented here, we would like to mention two future paths. In the context 

of  the  global  properties  of  the  atmosphere,  it  seems  relevant  to  study  the  links 

between the degree of the models mutual coherence and realism in the description 

of the mid- latitudes atmospheric variability and in the representation of ENSO (Van 

Oldenburg et al. 2005), which seems critical in the set-up of the regimes of the  low-

24 

frequency  mid- latitudes  planetary  waves  (Ruti  el  al.,  2006).  In  the  context  of  the 

understanding of climate change, it seems relevant to study the mutual coherence of 

the  GCMs  in  their  sensitivity  to  CO2  doubling  of  the  statistics  of  the  atmospheric 

waves cons idered in the present analysis.

pressure normalized with surface pressure (s ) or hybrid (h); in the chemistry column, the chemical species inculded in the model are specified; in the 

same column,  the string  xAy indicates whether the included aerosols are marine (x=m), desertic (x=d), urban (x=s) or sulfates (x=s) and if they are 

imposed as constants (y=c), prescribed according to climatolgy (y=p) or modeled (y=p); other model components may include biogeochemistry (B), 

vegetation (V), ice-sheets (I); Clouds (Cy) can be statistical (y=s) or modeled (y=m), the treatment of albedo is reported for oceanic albedo (Oy), ice 

albedo (Iy) and land surface albedo (Ly) that can be constant (y=c) or modeled (y=m); some details about the numerics are also specified, in particular 

it is specified whether the advection scheme for heat and moisture is or centered (C), upstream (U), spectral (S) or semi- Lagrangian (L); if the time 

stepping is explicit  – Leapfrog (Lp) - or semi- implicit (sI) and whether flux-adjustment is employed (F). For the oceanic component we report the 

horizontal resolution (resolution at the equator in parenteses if it is different from the rest of the domain); the number of vertical levels along with an 

indication of the vertical coordinate that can be depth (z), depth normalized with the maximum local depth (s ), hybrid (h) or density (d). For further

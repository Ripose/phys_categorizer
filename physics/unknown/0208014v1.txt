Mathematical  aspects  of  the  SU(1,1)  group  parameter  ξ  dynamics  governed  by 

Hamiltonians  exhibiting  some  special  types  of  time  dependence  has  been  presented  on  an 

elementary  level  from  the  point  of  view  of  M(cid:246)bius  transformation  of  complex  plane.  The 

trajectories  of  ξ    in  continuous  and  mappings  in  discrete  dynamics  are  considered.  Some 

simple  examples  have  been  examined.  Analytical  considerations  and  numerical  results  have 

been given.

1. INTRODUCTION 

A general method  for  constructing  coherent states  for an arbitrary Lie group has been given 

by  Perelomov  [12,13].  In  this  paper  we  are  interesting  in  time  evolution  of  the  SU(1,1) 

coherent  states.  Various  aspects  of  the  dynamics  were  examined  by  many  authors.  Some 

relevant  examples  concerning  continuos  dynamics  the  reader  may  find  in  articles 

[1,2,4,7,8,9,11]  and  discrete  dynamics  in  [3,5,6].  For  a  review  paper  on  construction  and 

classification of coherent states see [15]. The dynamics driven by a SU(1,1) Hamiltonian has 

been much investigated mainly in the context of the two-photon processes, the generation of 

squeezed states of light by nonlinear optical processes (e.g. degenerate parametric amplifiers 

or  down-converters),  the  propagation  of  an  electromagnetic  wave  in  a  nonhomogeneous 

medium  with  a  quadratic  dependence  of  the  refractive  index  on  the  transverse  coordinates, 

and time-dependent harmonic oscillators. The reader may find many references in the review 

article  [14].  The  evolution  of  quantum  states  ruled  by  the  time-dependent  coherence-

preserving SU(1,1) Hamiltonian can be analyzed using the Wei-Norman method which allows 

the  possibility  of  representing  the  time-evolution  operator  as  a  finite  product  of  exponential 

operators, where each exponent contains a product of a group generator and a time-dependent 

complex  function  [14].  The  functions  obey  a  system  of  Riccati  type  nonlinear  differential 

equations. Solutions of them cannot be obtained in general.  

In  this  paper  we  do  not  use  the  Wei-Norman  method.  Our  attention  is  focused  on  the 

SU(1,1) group parameter ξ . Nevertheless the equation of motion obeyed by this parameter is 

also a Riccati type equation. Because its general solutions are unknown, in order to gain the 

idea  about  the  SU(1,1)  dynamics  we  examine  some  interesting  examples  of  special  time-

dependence.  Both  continuous and  discrete  dynamics  is studied  and  connections  between  the 

two cases are shown. As far as we know, the discrete dynamics was considered in the case of 

infinitely narrow δ-like function pulses [3,6,10]. For instance Gerry et al. [6] use modulated 

 

2 

real  δ-like  pulsing  function  and  Bechler  et  al.[3]  consider  so  called  (cid:145)kicked  dynamics(cid:146)  with 

non-modulated complex coupling parameter. In this paper a model with modulated pulses of 

finite width and magnitude is used, which is maybe more realistic assumption in comparison 

to the (cid:145)kicked-like(cid:146) dynamics models. Though our treatment is (cid:145)classical(cid:146) rather than quantum 

but in the considered case of the coherence-preserving Hamiltonian (1) it is equivalent to the 

genuine quantum mechanical problem.  

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  section  2  we  introduce  briefly  the  idea  of  SU(1,1) 

coherent states, and the equation of motion of the SU(1,1) group parameter ξ. In section 3 we 

investigate  some  of  the  most  characteristic  features  of  the  continuous  dynamics  based  upon 

the equation of motion for ξ. We try to classify the types of trajectories of the SU(1,1) group 

parameter  ξ  on  the  phase  space  obtained  for  various  frequencies  of  coupling  parameter.  We 

give here some numerical and analytical results. In section 4 we construct iteration equation 

for  the  discrete  values  of  the  parameter  ξn.  The  evolution  is  described  by  PoincarØ-type 

evolution maps. We give some numerical examples of the maps for various pulsing functions. 

We  note  here  that  all  (cid:145)stroboscopic  equations(cid:146)  in  case  of  SU(1,1)  group  have    the  form  of 

M(cid:246)bius  automorphism  of  the  unit  circle.  At  the  end  we  show  how  the  chain  of  M(cid:246)bius 

transformations may be replaced by the chain of linear transformations of the complex plane. 

We use this approach to express in non-time-dependent pulsing case the n step of iteration via 

the  initial  condition.  The  last  section  5  contains  summary  of  the  paper  and  a  very  brief 

discussion of Lapunov exponent and the question of chaos in SU(1,1) systems. 

2. THE MODEL 

We  consider  a  model  described  by  the  Hamiltonian  given  as  a  linear  combination  of  the 

SU(1,1) group generators with time-dependent coefficients

Because the Hamiltonian is linear in the generators, the coherent character of the generalized 

coherent  states  associated  with  the  noncompact  Lie  group  SU(1,1)  under  time  evolution  is 

preserved,  which  means  that  the  quantum  and  classical  evolutions  are  essentially  identical 

[13, 4]. The generalized SU(1,1) coherent states |ξ〉  are defined  and constructed in the way 

first proposed by Perelomov [12, 13]. They are characterized by the complex parameter ξ  for 

which 0 ≤ξ< 1. We shall use the SU(1,1) group parameter ξ  as representation of the phase 

space. The (cid:145)classical(cid:146) equation of motion for ξ  is [4]

that  parameter  ξ    exactly  follows  the  quantum  state  |ξ〉,  we  can  restrict  our  attention  to  the 

motion  of  the  point  ξ    in  the  unit  circle  on  the  complex  plane.  It  remains  true  also  in  the 

discrete case. Another derivation of equation (7) the reader may find in [3, 11]. 

In  this  paper  we  examine  dynamics  in  continuous  and  discrete  case  followed  from  eq.  (7) 

assuming that χ  is time-dependent.    

3. CONTINUOUS  APPROACH 

3.1 Formulation of the problem 

The  phase-space  for  solutions  of  the  equation  (7)  is  a  unit  circle  in  the  complex  plane. 

Because of time-dependent coefficient χ(t)  the equation belongs to the class of nonautonomic 

differential equations. In general χ(t) is complex and may be written in form

t

)(

( )t

, 

where  c(t),  f(t)  are  real  functions.  However,  further,  we  restrict  our  considerations  to  less 

general form, when f(t) = k′ω t  (k′ is a real number). We can come to a rotating frame with 

frequency  2ω  in order to eliminate this frequency from the motion. It is equivalent to use the 

interaction picture. So we put k′ =2+k and our choice for χ(t)  is 

We seek solution of  (7) in the form

where  unknown  complex  function  a(t)  describes  motion  in  the  rotating  frame.  It  is  also 

limited to the interior of the unit circle i.e. 0≤a(t)<1. Substituting (9) into (7) we obtain

and a0 is the initial value of a(t). In particular, for a0=0 we get

then ξ(t) forms more or less regular spiral, i.e. the trajectory comes up closer and closer to the 

unit circle, without however reaching it. Further we will use the name (cid:145)spiral(cid:146) to describe such 

noncompact trajectory, inessential how much the curve resembles an ordinary, regular spiral. 

Arising of spiral in this case is a very characteristic feature for frequency 2ω , independent of 

the initial conditions, see Fig.1 as an example.  

 

Fig.1:  2ω frequency case. Parameters: c(t) = 0.1sin t + 0.05; ω =1; k = 0; ξ0 = −0.3+0.1i. 
The spiral is formed because of putting the movement a(t)  toward the circumference on the 

rotation with frequency 2ω . One of the most regular spiral can be obtained for constant c and 

a0=0. The point  a(t) runs from the point (0,0) along imaginary axis of the complex plane to 

the circumference  of the unit circle.  The time  dependence of a(t) is given by the function − 

 

6 

th(ct), which for small t is simply − ct. Thus, for small t in ξ picture it is so called Archimedes 

spiral. 

Quite  different  behavior  we  can  observe  if  S(t)  does  not  fulfill  the  condition  (13).  For 

instance, if a0 = 0 and values of S(t) are limited to an interval, in ξ(t)-picture we observe  more 

or less (it depends on complexity of function c(t) ) complicated figures drawn by point ξ(t) on 

complex plane, e.g. see Fig.2.  

Fig.2:  2ω frequency case. Parameters: c(t) =  sin π t; ω =1; k = 0; ξ0 = 0. 

Note that in this case the trajectory remains in an area of radius less then a unit. This is true 

also  for  other  initial  values.  Further  we  will  use  the  name  (cid:145)compact  figures(cid:146)  to  describe 

 

behavior like this. 

Another exact solution of eq.(10) can be found for arbitrary parameter k and constant c. It is

Spiral solutions appear only when circle (15) has crossover points with unit circle. Then, one 

 

7 

of them is an attracting fixed point, and the other one is repulsing. The point a(t) runs along 

the circle (15) but it cannot achieve the attracting point in finite time. On the maps for ξ(t)  we 

observe the spiral, because of  the  rotating term in eq.(9). The coordinates of the fix points 

are given by

For a given constant amplitude c it determines the rotational frequency k′ω  for which spiral 

solutions  appear.  E.g.,  for  k  =  0,  i.e.  in  frequency  2ω  case,  the  inequality  is  valid  for  any 

nonzero c.  For k = −2, i.e. zero frequency, it follows that |ω| < |c|.  

For  various  initial  values,  eq.(15)  gives  us  a  whole  map  of  trajectories  in  rotating  frame, 

which are nonconcentric circles with centers lying on the real axis. For |α |< 1/2 all the circles 

are entirely inside the unit circle. There are also two elliptic fixed points on the real axis, but 

only one of them, that lying inside the unit circle  is interesting for us (Fig.3).  

 

Fig.3:  The family of trajectories in the rotating frame. Parameters: c = 0.2; ω =1; k =1; nine initial values on real 

            axis:  a0 = −1, ... , 1. 
The  lager  is  |α  |  the  closer  is  the  elliptic  fixed  point  to  the  boundary  of  the  unit  circle.  For        

|α |=1/2 the fixed point achieves the unit circle and changes its character becoming parabolic 

 

8 

fixed point. For lager  |α | the parabolic fixed point (cid:145)splits(cid:146) into two hyperbolic fixed points, 

attractor and repulser (Fig.4).

              real axis:  a0 = −1, ... ,1. 

At  the  end  of  this  point  we  examine  some  linear  approximation  of  eq.(10).  This 

approximation may be used near the center of the unit circle, where |a|<<1. Instead of eq. (10) 

one may use

Note  that  R(k=0,  t)=S(t).  For  a0=0  and  constant  c  the  trajectory  obtained  in  the  linear 

approximation is the same as that corresponding to the exact solution (the circle (15) ). The 

difference between exact and approximated solutions appears only in time dependence of the 

movement along the trajectory.

 3.3 Arising of spirals 

Undoubtedly we should expect arising a spiral if |ξ(t)|=|a(t)|→1 for t→∞ . Taking eq.(10) and 

equation conjugated to it, one can obtain equation of motion for |a(t)| as

(20) 

(21)

The simple example is the case of c constant in value but changing its sign every time when 

the point a(t) (rotating with frequency 

ω

c

=∆

ω

) crosses the x-axe. It results 

in spiral behavior even for |α |< 1/2. 

The  condition  (22)  is  also  fulfilled  in  the  2ω  frequency  case.  It  is  interesting  however  that 

some effective 2ω frequencies can be introduced. E.g., let the coefficient χ(t) is given as 

χ

)(
t

=

0

sin(

κω

′−
kiet
)

ω
t

     ,  where  c0  is constant. 

(23) 

The sin(κωt) twice changes sign in its period τ, i.e. there is 2π phase gain in time interval τ. 

During this time the vector e-ik′ωt turns by  an angle k′ωτ. The total angle α = k′ωτ  + 2π , so 

effective frequency ω eff  ≡ α /τ  =  k′ω  + 2π /τ  , i.e., ω eff  = (k′  + κ) ω. 

Note  that  we  can  think  about  2π  phase  not  as  a  gain  but  as  a  loss.  It  leads  to  effective 

frequency ω eff  = (k′  − κ) ω. If we take k′  and κ  in the following way 

k′  + κ  =  2        or        k′  − κ  =  2   ,     i.e.       κ = − k      or        κ = k  , 

(24) 

 then we have 2ω  effective frequency case. Moreover the condition (13) is fulfilled. Indeed, 

 

10

in numerical experiments we observe spirals similar to that one shown in Fig.1. 

3.4 Constant χχχχ 

For  completeness  we  give  the  solution  of  eq.  (7)  for  constant  χ.  It  will  be  used  later  to 

construct the iteration equation in a discrete case. For initial value ξ(0) = ξ0 the solution is

For  real  p  the  trajectories  of  eq.  (25)  are  non-concentric  circles.  There  is  one  elliptic  fixed 

point inside the unit circle. For imaginary p two hyperbolic fixed points, one stable and one 

unstable appear. Both lying on the unit circle. In another way the result (25) may be obtained 

from eq.(14), if k=−2 and χ=c. The shape of trajectories for real p and imaginary p is exactly 

the same as those shown in Fig.3 and Fig.4. Certainly, at present they represent trajectories of 

point ξ(t). For any complex χ = ceiβ

 we need only to rotate the above picture given for c about 

angle β.  

At  last,  it  is  worth  to  mention  that  only  for  ω >|χ|  the  dynamics  is  well  defined,  since  only 

then  the Hamiltonian (1) is bounded from below [11]. 

4. DISCRETE APPROACH 

4.1 Formulation of the problem 

Our discrete model is as follows. We divide time on segments of length T. In each segment 

evolution from (n − 1)T to nT − t is free (i.e. χ = 0) and described  by 

ξτξ
0

)(

=

2

ie −

τω
)(

 

(26) 

where T  > t and ξ0 is constant in a segment. 

For time from nT − t to nT we impose constant χ different from zero, so evolution is governed 

 

 

11

by  the  eq.  (25).  Different  values  of  χn  can  be  in  different  segments.  We  examine  discrete 

values of ξn just after the pulses. As a result the pulsing dynamics is described by the iteration 

equation

This  form  of  An  ,  Bn  is  valid  for  real  pn  (ω >χ) . If  one  uses  imaginary  pn    e.g.  in  (cid:145)kicked 

dynamics(cid:146) then trigonometric functions change into hyperbolic functions. 

Formula (27) is a special case of so called M(cid:246)bius transformations well known in the complex 

plane  theory.  These  transformations  form  a  group.  Since  our  phase  space  is  limited  to  the 

interior of the unit circle it is enough to examine a subgroup of all M(cid:246)bius transformations, 

that map unit circle into itself, i.e., automorphisms of the unit circle 

The  transformation  depends  on  one  real  parameter  θ  (n)

  and  one  complex  parameter  a(n)  for 

which  |a(n)  |<1.  The  upper  index  n  indicates  that  the  parameters  may  be  step-dependent. 

Eq.(27) is a special case of eq.(28) and the group parameters are determined by

previously in literature, e.g. [3, 6]. Even continuous dynamics may be treated as a special case 

of it, if one puts T = t and T → 0.  

The group property  of the automorphism  enables  in principle to write down the form of the 

solution after n steps via the initial condition z0.

From eqs. (30) and (31) we note that if |zn| → 1 for n → ∞, then also |an| → 1 and inversely. 

The case |zn| → 1 is certainly an analog of the spiral behavior in the continuous dynamics. 

In the contrary, if the iterating point remains in the close area of radius less then unit, then it is 

an  analog  of  the compact behavior. Numerical results  give us both types  of  the behavior. In 

Fig.5 and Fig.6, χn rotates with n and simultaneously its absolute value changes periodically 

with iteration.

Fig.6:  Discrete dynamics for (cid:31)n = 0.56sin (Tn) exp(iTn). Parameters: T = 100; t = 0.1T;  ω = 1; ξ0 = 0. 

These pictures  illustrate that  there  exist some  critical value  of coefficient χn (for given time 

segments) when behavior drastically changes from compact to spiral behavior. 

4.2 Fixed points 

Fixed points for models, which are special cases of M(cid:246)bius automorphisms of the unit circle 

has been already discussed in literature, e.g. [3]. Here we briefly examine the general iteration 

eq.(28). Its fixed points given by the condition zn = zn+1 , fulfill the equation

For  sin2(θ /2) > |a|2   there are two elliptic fixed points, inverse to each other with respect to 

the unit circle. So only one of them lies in interesting us area of the unit circle. In parabolic 

case, when  sin2(θ /2) = |a|2   both points meet each other in the same place of the unit circle. 

And for sin2(θ /2) < |a|2    there are two hyperbolic fixed points on the unit circle. One of them 

is  attractive  and  the  other  is  repulsive.  In  general  χ  is  iteration-dependent  and  so  are 

parameters a(n), θ(n). Then, the above formula gives points which are fixed only in transition

from step n to n + 1. In fact we can treat eq. (33) as an equation of motion for fixed points. 

Finally, we explicitly write down the critical equation: sin2(θ /2) = |a|2 . For the special model 

described by eq.(27), it takes the form

We  plot  the  right  side  of  the  equation  as  a  function  of  |χn|  in  the  (cid:145)physical  range(cid:146)  ω >|χ|, 

(Fig.7).  

 

 

Fig.7:  Plot of function f = f (|χn|), (see eq.34), in range ω > |χn| . Parameters T = 20; t = 0.5 T; ω = 1. 

One  of  the  solutions  of  eq.(34)  is  |χn|  =  ω    independently  of  parameters  T,  t.  Note,  that  in 

contrary  to  the  continues  dynamics,  there  are  ranges,  where  hyperbolic  points  appear,  and 

ranges where only elliptic point exists even for the iteration-independent χ (for given T, t).  

4.3 Linear transformations 

We show here, that in some sense, we may shift the problem from M(cid:246)bius mappings of the 

unit circle to the linear transformations of it. The evolution of the iterated point is ruled by the 

chain M of M(cid:246)bius mappings (28)

The  linear  mapping  L  may  be  easily  found.  Then  using  (36)  one  may  find  expression  for 

wn(w0).  Unfortunately,  in  general  it  is  impossible  to  accomplish.  The  exception  is,  if 

parameters a,θ  do not depend of iteration, then (in every step) it is possible to make that the 

first mapping in (right side) (38)  maps infinity in fixed point of the second mapping in (38), 

and then the third mapping in (38) is reciprocal to the first. Using formula (36) we obtain wn 

via  initial  condition  w0  .  It  takes  on  the  form  of  eq.  (30)  with  the  following  effective

5. FINAL REMARKS 

In  the  first  part of the  paper  some  features of the continues dynamics of SU(1,1) have been 

described. We find two distinctive types of behavior. The first one where trajectories tend to 

the unit circle as a limit (spiral behavior) and the second one, where trajectories form more or 

less complicated figures inside unit circle and do not tend to the limit (compact behavior). 

In  the  next  part  of  the  paper  we  have  shown  that  it  is  convenient  to  examine  all  pulsed 

SU(1,1)  group  models  from  the  general  point  of  view  of  M(cid:246)bius  automorphism  of  the  unit 

circle.  The  two  distinctive  types  of  behavior  occurring  in  continuous  case  can  also  be 

identified  in  pulsing  cases.  As  an  example  of  a  pulsed  system  serves  us  the  model  of  finite 

width  and  magnitude  of  pulsing  peak.  Some  numerically  obtained  pictures,  e.g.  Fig.5,  look 

like (cid:145)chaotic(cid:146). Nevertheless it can be easily proved that the motion is in fact regular, because 

the Lapunov exponent is either zero or negative. In the latter case it may be finite or infinite. 

The  zero  Lapunov  exponent  corresponds  to  the  compact  behavior.  The  negative  Lapunov 

exponents correspond to spirals. There is no positive Lapunov exponent and it means there is 

no  classical  chaos  in  the  system.  There  were  some  attempts  to  look  for  (cid:145)fingerprints(cid:146)  of 

quantum  chaos  in  SU(1,1)  systems,  because  it  seems  that  the  quantum  autocorrelation 

function exhibits some decay, [6] (see also [10]). However that decay appears when the type 

of motion changes from the dynamics described by zero Lapunov exponent to the dynamics 

described  by  negative Lapunov exponent (compare Fig.5 and 6). The classical  and  quantum 

mappings based on the Hamiltonian (1) are equivalent. We think it is rather strange to look for 

(cid:145)fingerprints(cid:146)  of  quantum  chaos,  when  the  classical  counterpart  becomes  even  more  regular 

than before transition.

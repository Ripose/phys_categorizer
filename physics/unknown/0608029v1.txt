Abstract.
components of the angular momentum of a paraxial wave of electromagnetic
radiation are obtained from the general expressions for the angular momentum that
have been derived recently. This result will enable the general expressions for
angular momentum to be applied with confidence to the many configurations of
electromagnetic fields that are more complicated than plane or paraxial waves.

  Derivation of the paraxial form...

There is also a surface term whose existence is important for understanding the
apparently paradoxical properties of the angular momentum of plane waves [4] but
which is not needed for the discussion in the present paper.

In the past decade or more [7-12] there has been much work on the angular

momentum properties of paraxial electromagnetic waves, which describe laser
light with great accuracy. Very simple expressions have been derived for the spin
and orbital components of the angular momentum of paraxial waves and these
have been confirmed experimentally. The issue that is examined in the present
paper is whether these simple expressions can be derived from the general
expressions (3) and (4) above. It is shown that they can. This result gives
confidence that (3) and (4) will be able to be applied to configurations of fields
that are more complicated than plane or paraxial waves.

2. The paraxial approximation
In this section we summarize results for angular momentum that have been
reported to have been obtained in the paraxial approximation for a wave of
cylindrical cross-section with radius R travelling in the z direction [7, 9]. It is
assumed that the electromagnetic vector potential is of the form  A = Sf  with
polarization vector  S = ˆ x + ˆ y , 
 and 

 being complex numbers with

* = 1, the star denoting the complex conjugate, and the complex scalar f

* +
given by

f = bv(r)e

il ei(kz -

t )

, 

where the cylindrical coordinates are (r,
v(r), which is a real function of r and falls off above a radius R, is normalized to

,z). The quantity b is a real amplitude and

v(r)2

rdr = 1. This is the form of paraxial waves that possesses orbital angular

0
momentum about the z-axis. The wavelength is small compared to the transverse
diameter 2R of the wave so that kR >> 1. For a red laser of beam diameter 2 mm
the value of kR is around 10,000. The large value of this factor will be important in
later stages of the calculation.

The magnetic field is given by  B = - S ·

f and the electric field is

obtained from the Lorenz gauge condition [9]. Using (1), the density of angular
momentum in the z direction is reported to come to [9]

  Derivation of the paraxial form...

K0 is the Bessel function of imaginary argument [13] and index 0. Because the
Bessel function has a logarithmic divergence at zero argument and decays
monotonically and faster than exponentially for large argument [13] it follows that
contributions to the integral in (13) will occur only around a = 1 (or r' = r) and
 = ' so these conditions may be imposed on the slowly varying factors. In the

exp[-il(  - ')] factor in (13) the integral of the sine part vanishes by symmetry and
the cosine part becomes unity, so the integral become real.

The integral of the cosine part of the exp[-il(  - ')] factor in (24) vanishes by
symmetry and the sine part may be replaced by its argument.

The Bessel function K1(x) diverges as 1/x as x ﬁ

 0 and decays faster than

exponentially at large x. For kr >> 1 it is clear that the main contributions to the
integral will come from around a = 1 and 
'; the denominator also produces a
divergence at these values of the parameters. These values may therefore be put in

the factors outside the integral. Making the substitutions m = 1 - a, n =

the same result except with an m2 instead of an n2. Adding the two together,

  Derivation of the paraxial form...

5. Discussion
Starting from the expressions (3) and (4) for the spin and orbital components of
the angular momentum of the general electromagnetic field we have obtained the
results (20) and (27) for the angular momentum of a paraxial wave described by
(5), the different constants of proportionality to those of (7) and (8) being a
consequence of the units used. The general expressions given at the beginning of
this paper give the correct result for plane waves [2] and have enabled the paradox
associated with the boundaries of a plane wave to be resolved [4]. These results,
together with those of this paper, which confirm the validity of the paraxial results
(7) and (8), will enable the general expressions for angular momentum (3) and (4)
to be applied with confidence to the many configurations of electromagnetic fields
that are more complicated than plane or paraxial waves.

Abstract
The Solar sail is a large thin film used to collect solar light pressure for moving of space apparatus. 
Unfortunately, the solar radiation pressure is very small about 9 N/m2 at Earth's orbit. However, 
the light force significantly increases up to 0.2 - 0.35 N/m2 near the Sun. The author offers his
research on a new revolutionary highly reflective solar sail which flyby (after special maneuver) 
near Sun and attains velocity up to 400 km/sec and reaching far planets of the Solar system in short 
time or enable flights out of Solar system. New, highly reflective sail-mirror allows avoiding the 
strong heating of the solar sail. It may be useful for probes close to the Sun and Mercury and Venus.
  Key words: AB-solar sail, highly reflective solar sail, high speed propulsion.

Introduction

A solar sail is a thin film reflector that uses solar energy for propulsion. The spacecraft deploys a
large, lightweight sail which reflects light from the Sun (or some other source). The radiation 
pressure on the sail provides thrust by reflecting photons. The solar radiation pressure is very small
6.7 Newtons per gigawatt. That equals 9.1210 -6 N/m2 at Earth's orbit (1 AU - Astronomic Unit = 
150 million km) and decreases by the square of the distance from the sun. However, the solar light 
pressure significently increases near sun and not far above it can reach 0.2 - 0.35 (up o.4 on Solar 
surfice) N/m2.  

Brief history. The conventional solar sail concept was first proposed by Friedrich Zander in 1924
[1] and gradually refined over the decades. The author proposed innovations and a new design of 
Solar sail in 1965 [2, 3], and theory was developed in [3] -[6]. Author offers a new revolutionary 
solar AB-sail. Main particularity this sail is very high reflectivity which allows the AB-sail to come
very close to the Sun without great heating and to attain high light force and high speed. 

This innovation allows (main advantages only): 1) to achieve very high speed up 400 km/s; 2) easy 
to control an amount and direction of thrust without turning a gigantic sail; 3) to utilize the solar sail 
as a power generator (for example, electricity generator); 4) to use the solar sail for long-distance 
communication systems.

Short information about Sun. The pressure of light equals P = 2E/c (where E is energy of 
radiation, c is light speed (c = 3108 m/s)). The solar light energy at Earth's orbit equals 1.4 kW/m2, 
but near a solar surface it reaches up to 64103 kW/m2 (it increases 47 thousand time!). As the 
result the light pressure jumps up to 0.4 N/m2. The space apparatus can get significant acceleration 
(up to 80 m/s2) and high speed up to 400  - 500 km/s.

  Spectrum of Sun is presented in fig.1.

Note, the space mirror (sail) will not heat only if it reflects all solar spectrum ( = 0.2  3m). 

Description and Innovations

Description. The suggested AB space sail is presented in fig. 2. It consists of: a thin high reflection
film (solar sail) supported by an inflatable ring (or other method), space apparatus connected to solar 
sail, a heat screen defends the apparatus from solar radiation.  

The thin film includes millions of very small prisms (angle 45o, side 3  30 m). The solar light is 
totally reflected back into the incident medium. This effect is called total internal reflection. Total 
internal reflection is used in the proposed reflector. As it is shown in [5] Ch.12 the light absorption 
is very small (10 -5 10 -7) and radiation heating is small (see computation section).

 Another possible design for the suggested solar sail is presented in fig.3. Here solar sail has concave 
form (or that plate is made like Fresnel mirror). The sail concentrates solar light on a small control
mirror 4. That mirror allows re-directed (reflected) solar beam and to change value and direction of 
the sail thrust without turning the large solar sail. Between thin films 1, 8 there is a small gas 
pressure which supports the concave form of reflector 1. Concentration of energy can reach 103 
104 times, temperature greater than 5000 oK. This energy may be very large. For the sail of 200200 
m, at Earth orbit the energy is 5.6104 kW. This energy may be used for apparatus propulsion or 
other possibilities (see [5]), for example, to generate electricity. The concave reflector may be also 
utilized for long-distance radio communication.

    The trajectory of the high speed solar AB-sail is shown in fig.4. The sail starts from Earth orbit.
Then is accelerated by a solar light to up 11 km/s in opposed direction of Earth moving around Sun 
and leaves Earth gravitational field. The Earth has a speed about 29 km/s in its around Sun orbit.
The sail will be have 29 -11=18 km/s.  That is braked and moves to Sun (trajectory 4). Near the Sun 
the reflector is turned for acceleration to get a high speed (up to 400 km/s) from a powerful solar 
radiation. The second solar space speed is about 619 km/s. If AB sail makes three small revolutions 
around Sun, it can then reach speed of a 1000 km/s and leaves the Solar system with a speed about 
400 km/s.  Suggested highly reflective screen protects the apparatus from an excessive solar heating. 

Note, the offered AB sail allows also to brake an apparatus very efficiency from high speed to low 
speed. If we send AB sail to another star, it can brake at that star and became a satellite of the star 
(or a planet of that solar system).

   In [5] Ch. 12, Annt. #3 it is shown the absorption coefficient may reaches  = 10 -7  for suggested 
mirror. If it is taken  =10 -4, 1 = 2 =0.9, the sail temperature near the sun will be about 500 oK.
That temperature is safe for many dielectric materials. The tangential sail speed in nearest point to 
Sun reaches 600 km/s and time of AB sail abiding near Sun is only some minutes.  

3. Trajectory and speed. The apparatus (sail) radial speed and flight time can be estimated by 
equations [5] p.322.

where T1 is period of rotation, sec; a1 is semi-axis of big axis of ellipse, m; g0 is planet (star)

K  41014 m3/s2, g0 9.81 m/s2;  s05.378106 m ).

Computations are presented in fig. 5-7. It can be seen that the AB sail can reach very high speed (up 
400 km/s) at distance 10 millions km (<1 AU) from Sun and a purview of Solar System . The flight 
time from Sun to the far planets is short time if we use the AB space sail (to Pluto about 150 days). 
But we must add a time of braking (from 29 km/s to  1 km/s) and about 65 days moving from Earth 
orbit to Sun (trajectory 4 in fig. 4).

The main particularity of offered AB-sail-reflector is special layer with very high reflectivity in the 
full main range of a solar spectrum (fig.1) from 0.1 to 5 m. That means the temperature of offered 
sail will be significantly lower then the solar temperature and safe, allowable operating for offered 
layers and AB-sail-reflector.

The other particularity is special selective coating which has high thermal emissions close to 
absolute black body in widely range of solar spectrum.

    The conventional mirror or multilayer dielectric mirror [12] is useless in this case. They have a 
high reflectivity only in narrow range of solar spectrum (Fig. 1) and decrease the adsorbed solar 
energy up 2 -5%. The solar surface has temperature about 5800 oK and melts any dielectric layers 
together with sail-mirror.

Discussion

Conclusion

The suggested new AB sail can fly very close to the Sun's surface and get high speed which is 
enough for quick flight to far planets and out of our Solar System. Advantages allow: 1) to get very 
high speed up 400 km/s; 2) easy to control an amount and direction of thrust without turning a 
gigantic sail; 3) to utilize of the solar sail as a power generator (for example, electricity generator); 
4) to use the solar sail for long-distance communication systems.
   The same researches were made by author for solar wind sail and other propulsion [7]-[11].

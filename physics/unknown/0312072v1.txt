1. Introduction

We  have  performed  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  bunch  lengthening  and  microwave
instability in the DAΦNE main rings which includes analytical estimates, numerical simulations
and measurements.

First, we have applied a double Water Bag distribution model and solved the Vlasov equation
in order to investigate the bunch longitudinal coherent mode coupling leading to the microwave
instability and evaluate the instability threshold.

 
Then,  very  time  consuming  numerical  calculations  have  been  performed  to  simulate  the
bunch lengthening process and estimate the energy spread growth (bunch widening) beyond the
microwave threshold. For this purpose we tracked 300000 macroparticles interacting through the
estimated  machine  wakefield  [1]  over  4  damping  times.  Such  a  high  number  of  the
macropatricles has been proven to be necessary to avoid artificial numerical growth of the bunch
energy spread.

Finally, the bunch length has been measured in the DAΦNE positron ring. The bunch signal
was picked up by a broad band button [2]. The resulting bunch distribution has been found by
processing  the  button  signal  taking  into  account  the  button  transfer  impedance  and  the
attenuation of the cables connecting the button to a sampling oscilloscope.

Below  we  describe  the  results  of  the  study  and  compare  the  analytical  predictions  with
numerical  and  measured  data.  The  main  relevant  DAΦNE  main  ring  parameters  are  listed  in
Table 1.

2. Analytical estimates

It is widely believed (see [3, 4], for example) that the microwave instability is caused by the
bunch longitudinal coherent mode coupling. The instability can manifest itself either through the
coupling among the azimuthal modes or the radial ones having the same azimuthal number.

In  the  first  case  the  frequencies  of  the  azimuthal  modes  have  to  be  shifted  by  amounts
comparable to the synchrotron frequency (“strong” instability). The frequency shifts leading to
the radial mode coupling can be substantially smaller than the synchrotron frequency (“weak”
instability).

An analytical model, which we follow in this paper, allows to treat the mode coupling taking
into  account  splitting  of  each  azimuthal  mode  in  two  radial  modes.  It  is  based  on  the
approximation of the real bunch distribution by a double Water Bag distribution [5].

where the constant ψ  is derived from the normalization condition,  Γ  is a parameter which has to
be chosen between 0 and 1 to better approximate the real distribution by the double Water Bag,
U J( )  is the step function, and  J  the action variable.

  By  substititing  the  above  distribution  in  the  Vlasov  equation,  the  following  eigenvalue

The frequencies of the coherent modes Ωm,k, with  m  being the azimuthal mode number and
k the radial one (k = 0;1), are obtained by equating to 1 the determinant of the eigenvalue system.
The  imaginary  part  of  Ωm,k  gives  the  rise  time  of  the  weak  microwave  instability.  Such  an
imaginary  part  comes  out  when  two  radial  modes  couple  together.  The  quantity  ω J( )   is  the
synchrotron frequency depending on  J  due to the non linearities of the wake fields  w z( ) . The
other quantities are described in Appendix together with the derivation of the system (2) from the
Vlasov equation. Actually, the eigenvalue system has an infinite number of equations (m = 0,…,
∞) which has to be truncated to get Ωm,k. In our case we limit our analysis up to m = 9.

The machine wake function  w z( ) we used in the analytical model was calculated at the project
stage of the collider [1]. Figure 1 shows the wake potential of a short Gaussian bunch with the
rms length σ
z = 2.5 mm, i. e. much shorter than the nominal bunch length of 3 cm, which we use
as the machine wake function.

The first nine azimuthal modes each splitting in two radial lines are shown in Fig. 2. Here the
dependencies  of  the  mode  frequencies  on  the  bunch  current  are  given  for  four  possible  RF
voltages (100 kV, 150 kV, 200 kV and 250 kV). The respective decrements (inverse rise times) of
the instability due to the radial mode coupling are reported in Fig. 3.

As it can be seen, at lower voltages the instability threshold is caused by the coupling of the
modes with low azimuthal numbers. For example, the instability at VRF = 100 kV is driven by the
radial mode coupling of the quadrupole (m = 2) and sextupole modes (m = 3). At higher voltages
the coupling of the higher order modes results in an instability. Namely, at 200 kV and 250 kV
the first unstable modes are m = 9 and m = 8, respectively.

The unstable longitudinal coherent modes cause longitudinal bunch shape modulation. This
is a  harmful  effect  because  the  modulation  excites  new  beam-beam  resonances  degrading  the
collider performance. Therefore, higher RF  voltages would be preferable for DAΦNE operation
since  the  higher  order  unstable  modes  create  higher  order  beam-beam  resonances  which  are
much less dangerous for the beam-beam interaction.

Figure 4 enlarges the scale of Fig. 2 to show in details the coupling of the first longitudinal
modes  (dipole,  quadrupole  and  sextupole)  which  are  supposed  to  be  most  dangerous  for  the
beam-beam collisions. At 100 kV the mode defining the  microwave  instability  threshold  at  the
current of 25 mA is the quadrupole one (m =  2). By increasing the RF  voltage  to  150  kV  the
threshold is pushed up to 38 mA.

This coincides exactly with our  observations  during  the  bunch  lengthening  measurements.
We could detect an appearance of the pure quadrupole synchrotron sidebands at 25 - 26 mA with
VRF =  100 kV. The dipole mode got unstable later at about 35 mA. An RF  voltage increase  to
150 kV shifted the quadrupole mode threshold to 38 mA, while the dipole mode was stable up to
the nominal bunch current of 44 mA. For  higher RF  voltages the coupling of the low  coherent
modes should occur for currents higher than the nominal value.

However, we should note here that the instability growth time is much faster than the machine
natural damping time of 17 ms for both the lower and higher order coherent modes. This means
that the instability threshold is lower for higher RF voltages even though the instability is excited
by  the  coupling  of  higher  order  unstable  modes.  This  has  been  checked  by  numerical
simulations.

3. Numerical simulations

In order to simulate the bunch lengthening process, we have undertaken a numerical tracking
z  =  2.5 mm shown in Fig.  1  as  the

using the wake potential of a short gaussian bunch with  σ
machine wake function.

The tracking method is essentially the same as that successfully used in the bunch lengthen-
ing simulations for the SLC damping rings [6, 7], SPEAR [8], PETRA and LEP[9] and DAΦNE
accumulator ring [10]. The motion of Ns superparticles representing the beam is described in the
longitudinal phase space by [7]:

Note  that  zj  in  the  expression  (5)  are  the  coordinates  of  the  bin  centers  and  the  induced
voltage  at  the  positions  of  the  super  particles  is  found  by  a  linear  interpolation  between  the
Vind(zj). Here Nb(zi)  is the number of super particles in the bin with the center at zi    and w(z) is
the machine wake function.

In our simulations 300000 macroparticles particles are tracked over 4 damping times and the
average  bunch  properties,  as  rms  length,  rms  energy  spread,  coordinate  of  the  centroid,  are
calculated by averaging  over  the  last  damping  time.  Such  a  high  number  of  macroparticles  is
necessary to avoid artificial numerical bunch energy spread growth.

Figure  5  shows  an  example  of  the  numerical  energy  spread  growth  as  a  function  of
modelling macroparticles for the bunch current of 30 mA. 300000 particles have been chosen as
a compromise between an acceptable accuracy and  a  reasonable  CPU  time  (still  it  takes  some
days of CPU time on the LNF  UNIX computer cluster to perform the simulations). If has been
also found that the results do not change much if the number of bins is higher than 80.

The results of the numerical simulations for the DAΦNE main rings are summarised in Fig.
6. In particular, this Figure shows the rms bunch length (a),  rms  bunch  energy  spread  (c),  the
bunch centroid shift (b) as a function of the bunch current, calculated for two RF  voltages, 100
kV and 250 kV, which are considered as limits of the RF cavity working range.

The normalised bunch distributions are shown in the last plot (d) in Fig. 6. The distributions
are wider than Gaussian distributions  due  to  the  bunch  interaction  with  the  inductive  machine
impedance and slightly distorted due to the real impedance. Because of this, we will use the full
width at half maximum size (FWHM)  of the bunch when comparing the simulation results and
measurement data.

As expected (see the discussion in the previous chapter), the microwave instability threshold
(see Fig. 6(c)) is lower and the bunch energy spread is higher for the higher RF  voltage. In both
cases the bunch widening is modest: the bunch energy spread growth does not exceed 40%  of
the nominal value.

As it is seen the numerical thresholds are by about 30% lower than the calculated  ones.  In
our opinion, this is still a good result considering that the analytical model is rather crude. One
could  refine  the  model  including  splitting  of  each  azimuthal  mode  in  more  radial  lines.  The
agreement could probably be improved if the real machine wake function is  used  in  the  model
instead of the wake potential of a very short, but still finite , Gaussian bunch. But this is almost
an impossible task since no one numerical code calculates this function directly.

4. Bunch length measurements

The  bunch  length  in  the  DAΦNE  positron  ring  has  been  measured  processing  the  beam
signal from a broad band button electrode [2] connected with a low attenuation cable (ANDREW
FSJB-50A)  8  m  long  to  a  sampling  oscilloscope  TEKTRONIX  11801A,  equipped  with  a
sampling head SD-24 with a rise time of 17.5 psec and an equivalent bandwidth of 20 GHz.  The
stability of the waveform has been achieved by using the signal from a stripline as a trigger. The
waveform  is  sent  via  a  GPIB  interface  to  the  control  system  for  storage  and  off  -  line
reconstruction.

The resulting bunch distribution is found by processing the button signal taking into account
the button transfer impedance and attenuation of the cable connecting the button to the measuring
device.

Let I(ω)  and  V(ω)  be  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  real  bunch  distribution  and  the  signal

recorded by the oscilloscope, respectively. The two values are related by:

where  Zb(ω)  is  the  button  transfer  impedance  and  α(ω)  is  the  frequency  dependent  cable
attenuation.  Then,  the  bunch  distribution  in  time  domain  is  obtained  by  the  inverse  Fourier
transform of I(ω) as:

4.1  Button  transfer  function

It  has  been  shown  that  the  DAΦNE  broad  band  button  electrode  transfer  impedance  is

described well up to the frequency of 5.2 GHz by the following analytical formula [2]:

1 = 1/(R0Cb), ω

where ω
2 = c/2r and the coverage factor φ = r/4b. In our case the capacitance Cb
of the button to ground is equal to 3.8 pF, R0 is 50 Ω, the button  radius  r  is  7.5  mm  and  the
radius of the beam pipe b is equal to 44 mm.

Beyond 5 GHz the wave lengths get comparable with the button size and the button transfer
impedance is no longer described well by the analytical expression (2). Indeed, at 5.2  GHz  we
observe the first button resonance which corresponds to  the  TE-111  mode  trapped  around  the
button.  Further  numerical  simulations  have  also  shown  that  at  higher  frequencies  the  button
transfer impedance gets lower and tends to zero at approximately 7 GHz. This means that we can
rely on the measurements results only for the bunches whose frequency spectrum lies within 5
GHz,  i.  e.  for  the  bunches  longer  than  ~  1.5  cm.  Because  of  that,  in  the  following  we  will
compare  the  numerical  simulations  and  measurement  results  obtained  at  relatively  low  RF
voltages.

Figure 7a) shows the button response to a Gaussian pulse which we can get applying eq. (8),

while Fig. 7b) shows a typical measured signal.

  As it can be seen, the shape of the two signals are very similar, except for a small ringing at
the tail of the measured signal. It corresponds to the oscillations with the frequency of 5.2 GHz,
i.  e.  the  tail  of  the  bunch  spectrum  couples  to  the  first  button  resonance  at  this  frequency.
However,  this  does  not  affect  much  the  results  of  our  measurements,  especially  for  longer
bunches.

4.2  Cable  attenuation

In order to reduce the signal distortion as much as possible one has to choose a cable with
appropriate parameters: low attenuation, high maximum cable frequency, i. e.  cut-off  frequency
of the first parasitic propagating wave, and minimal cable length.

It turns out that due to the space constraints the minimal allowable cable length is 8 m for the
bunch  length  measurements  in  the  DAΦNE  positron  ring,  while  it  is  equal  to  13  m  for  the

We  have choosen a  low  attenuation  1/4”  ANDREW  FSJB  -  50  A  cable.  We  could  also
select  a  1/2’’  ANDREW  FSJB  -  50  B  which  has  even  lower  attenuation,  but  it  has  lower
maximum frequency (10 GHz)  and, what is more important, having bigger diameter,  it  is  more
difficult to pull it between the control room and the BPM.

Below we estimate the possible signal distortion due to the cables, i.e. the signal elongation

and its shape distortion.

The cable Green function, i. e. the cable response to the δ-signal is given by [11]:

where Φ(x) is the error function. The expression (15) allows to estimate how a  cable  rise  time
depends on the cable length and attenuation. As an example, in Fig. 8 we compare responses to a
step signal of the 1/4’’ FSJ1-50A cables of 8 m (a) and 60 m (b) long.

  One  can  also  easily  find  a  cable  response  to  a  rectangular  pulse  of  a  duration  ∆t  as  the
difference of the cable responses to the two step signals separated by the time interval ∆t.

However, the bunch shape is expected to be nearly Gaussian in the DAΦNE main rings. In
order to evaluate how strong the distortion due  to  the  cables  could  be,  let  us  consider  a  cable
response to a purely Gaussian pulse with rms length σ. Then, the measured signal is proportional

Figure 9 shows the responses to the Gaussian pulse of 100 ps (bunch length σz =  3 cm) for
 
cables 8 m (b) and 60 m (a) long, respectively. As it can be seen, the measured signal for the 60
m long cable is strongly distorted and much wider with respect to the actual Gaussian one, while
the 8 m long cable signal closely resembles the primary Gaussian pulse.

In order to give a quantitative measure of the signal elongation due to the cable attenuation let
us introduce a “distortion factor” F as a ratio of the rms value of an input Gaussian pulse to the

full  width  at  half  maximum  value 
2√(2ln2) = 2.3548... Clearly, in the absence of cable attenuation (distortion) the factor F is equal
to unity.

(FWHM)  of 

For the example of Fig. 9, the distortion factor is equal to 1.064 and 1.96 for the 8 m long
cable and 60 m long cable, respectively, i. e. for the longer cable the measured signal is longer by
about a factor of 2 than the Gaussian pulse at the cable input.

Table 2 summarizes the distortion factors for two cables, 1/4’’  FSJ1-50A and 1/2’’  FSJ4-

50B, calculated for the expected range of the bunch length in the main rings (σz  = 1 - 3 cm).

As it can be seen, the distortion introduced by both cables does not differ much. So, we have
chosen FSJ1  - 50A cable since it is more mechanically flexible and we have calibrated the 8 m
long  piece  of  the  cable  measuring  the  dependence  of  the  attenuation  on  the  frequency  (see
Fig. 10).

4.3 Measurement results

First, we recorded bunch signals at low RF voltages of 100 kV and 150 kV because we were
expecting that the bunch would be long enough to have the bunch spectrum below 5 GHz. In this
frequency range the button transfer impedance is described well by  the  analytical  formula  (see
discussion in 4.1). In order to elaborate the bunch distributions from the measured data, we apply
eqs.  (6)  -  (7)  taking  into  account  the  button  transfer  impedance,  eq.(8)  and  the  frequency
dependent cable attenuation shown in Fig. 10.

The measurements were performed for the currents in the range from ~ 0 mA to 48 mA (note
that  the  nominal  design  current  is  43.7  mA).  Figure  11  shows  an  example  of  the  elaborated
bunch  distributions  in  case  of  VRF  =  150  kV  for  the  currents  of  2  mA  (a)  and  48  mA  (b),
respectively.

It is clearly seen that the bunch gets wider at higher current due to  the  interaction  with  the
imaginary  (mainly  inductive)  machine  impedance  and  the  distribution  symmetry  is  slightly
broken because of power losses from the real part of the coupling impedance.

For shorter bunches (Fig. 11(a)) we observe oscillations in the tail of the distribution which
correspond to the first parasitic button resonance. This means that at low currents the bunch  is
still relatively short such that the tail of its  frequency  spectrum  couples  to  this  resonance.  For
longer bunches (see Fig. 11(b)) the oscillations disappear.

Figure 11: Bunch distribution at 150 kV: a) bunch current 2 mA; b) bunch current 48 mA.

Figure  12  compares  the  measured  bunch  length  (FWHM,  circles)  with  the  results  of
numerical simulations (solid line). The agreement is very much satisfactory in almost all range of
currents, except for low currents < 5 mA.

Certainly,  the  discrepancy  at  the  low  currents  is  not  due  to  errors  of  the  numerical
simulations  since  the  natural  bunch  length  at  the  given  voltage  is  known  quite  precisely  and
agrees well with the simulations. We attribute the small disagreement to the above discussed fact
that for frequencies higher 5. 2 GHz the button transfer impedance is no longer described well
by the analytical expression (8) and, therefore, our treatment is not valid for bunches shorter than
~1.5 - 1.7 cm.

However, we believe that it is safe to rely on the results of the numerical simulations in this
case. Moreover, the simulations reproduce well not only the bunch length behavior as a function
of current, but also the internal bunch distribution. Figure 13 shows as an example a comparison
between the measured and simulated bunch shapes at I = 26 mA and VRF = 100 kV. This means
that the estimated wake field, shown in Fig. 1, can be successfully applied for the bunch length
(and shape) evaluations at different working conditions (bunch currents, RF  voltages, momentum
compactions etc.).

Fourier transform of the wake wake fields demonstrates  that  in  the  frequency  range  up  to
20 GHz the absolute value of the normalized coupling machine impedance |Z/n| does not exceed
0.6 Ω.

As a final result, we plot the bunch lengthening  graphs  (Fig.  14)  calculated  numerically  at
two  limiting  RF  voltages  of  100  kV  and  250  kV  to  show  a  possible  range  of  bunch  length
variations. Here we show FWHM  bunch length instead of the rms size  since  the  bunch  shape
differs from Gaussian.

5. Conclusions

The estimated machine normalized longitudinal coupling impedance |Z/n| is lower than 0.6 Ω
in the frequency up to 20 GHz.  The bunch length (FWHM/2.3548..)  at nominal current can be
varied from 2.2 cm at VRF = 250 kV to 3 cm at VRF = 100 kV.

Numerical  simulations  based  on  multiturn  tracking  of  a  large  number  of  macroparticles

interacting through the calculated numerically wake field (shown in Fig. 1) suit well to describe
bunch lengthening and bunch shape in DAΦNE at different working conditions.

Double  Water  Bag  model  predictions  of  the  longitudinal  coherent  mode  coupling  so  far
coincide with experimental observations. According  to  the  model,  the  RF  voltages  higher  than
150 kV would be preferable for DAΦNE operation in order to avoid the radial mode coupling of
the lowest azimuthal modes (dipole, quadrupole and sextupole) at nominal  current.  Such  mode
coupling  leads  to  the  bunch  shape  modulations  which  could  be  harmful  for  beam-beam
interactions.

where  M  is the matrix given by equation (A.5), and  I  the identity matrix. The instability arises
when the frequencies  Ω  become complex. This happens when two different longitudinal modes
couple together. The longitudinal mode coupling theory could give a microwave threshold higher

than the measured one.

For  a complete analysis of the mode  coupling,  one  should  include  in  the  treatment  also  the

radial modes of oscillation for every azimuthal number. Unfortunately solutions for  the  Vlasov

equation in this case can be found only when one considers a very simple distribution function,

such as the so-called double water-bag distribution.

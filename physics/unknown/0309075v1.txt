operating in vacuo that are imposed by a number of fundamental physical noise

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Following  the  trend  in  semiconductor  electronics,  mechanical  devices  are  rapidly  being 

miniaturized  into  the  submicron domain.1      Nanomechanical  structures provide  extremely  high 

resonance  frequencies,  minuscule  active  masses  and  very  small  force  constants.  An  additional 

and  important  attribute  is  the  high  quality  (Q)  factors  of  their  resonant  modes.    These  are 

currently  in  the  range,  Q  ~  103  to  105,  which  is  significantly  higher  than  those  of  electrical 

resonant  circuits.    This  powerful  combination  of  attributes  translates  into  opportunities  for 

unprecedented  mass  sensitivity  at  high  operational  (resonance)  frequencies  —  thus  opening  a 

novel realm of sensing applications. 

Resonant mass sensors are already employed in many diverse fields  of science and technology.  

These  devices  operate  by  providing a  frequency  shift  that is directly  proportional  to the  inertial 

mass  of  the  analyte  molecules  accreted  upon  them.    Among  the  most  sensitive  realizations  are 

those  based  on  the  acoustic  vibratory  modes  of  crystals,2,3,4  thin  films5  and  micron-sized 

cantilevers.6,7,8  In recent experiments,9 we have demonstrated the unparalleled mass sensitivity of 

nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) operating in vacuo, using devices that take advantage of 

the aforementioned attributes.  Given the recent realization of nanomechanical devices operating 

at microwave frequencies,10 prospects for weighing individual, electrically neutral molecules with 

single-Dalton11 sensitivity are now feasible.9      

Two  properties  are  central  in  establishing  the  sensitivity  of  resonant  mass  sensors:  (a)  the 

effective  vibratory  mass  of  the  resonator  and  (b)  the  short-  and  long-term  resonance  frequency 

stability  of  the  device.    The  effective  vibratory  mass  is  determined  by  the  geometry  and

configuration of the resonant structure, and by the properties of the materials composing it.  The 

frequency  stability  of  the  resonator  is,  in  turn,  governed  by  two  classes  of  mechanisms  — 

extrinsic  processes  that  originate  from  the  transducer  and  readout  circuitry12,13  and  intrinsic 

processes  fundamental  to  the  nanomechanical  resonator  itself.14,15    The  frequency  stability  in 

macro-  and  micro-mechanical  resonators  have,  in  most  cases  to  date,  been  limited  by  extrinsic 

elements.    In the domain of NEMS, however, — given the enhanced sensitivity that is attainable 

as devices become smaller10 and ultrasensitive displacement transduction techniques emerge16,17 

—  fundamental  fluctuation  processes  are  increasingly  likely  to  determine  the  outcome.    These 

considerations motivate the present work.  Below we shall explore how fundamental fluctuation 

processes impose ultimate limits upon the sensitivity of NEMS-based inertial mass sensors.   

Even though our focus in this paper is upon establishing the fundamental limits to mass sensitivity 

of NEMS, the results we obtain are more general.  As discussed in more detail below, a crucial 

aspect  of  investigating  the  ultimate  mass  sensitivity  in  NEMS  is,  in  fact,  determining  the 

fundamental limits to frequency-shift detection.  In this respect, our work is complementary to a 

recent  paper  by  Cleland  and  Roukes,14  in  which  expressions  are  derived  for  phase  noise 

originating from a variety of physical processes.  That work, however, does not address important 

considerations  concerning  specific  measurement  schemes  that  convert  this  phase  noise  into 

frequency fluctuations.  We shall elucidate them here. 

A  simple  and  particularly  illustrative  structure  for  realizing  high  frequency  nanomechanical 

resonators is the doubly-clamped beam (Fig. 1).  We derive estimates for the ultimate limits to 

mass  sensing  based  upon  doubly-clamped  Si  beam  resonators  with  a  fundamental  resonance

.      We  evaluate  sensing  prospects  for  two  different  model 

realizations  of  1GHz  fundamental-mode,  doubly-clamped  beam  resonators; 

these  are 

summarized  by  the  parameters  displayed  in  Table  I.    We  use  a  damped,  simple  harmonic 

oscillator model to describe the flexural motion of the beam (here chosen as out-of plane, cf. Fig. 

1)  in  the  vicinity  of  the  fundamental  resonance.    For 

10≥Q

,  this  provides  an  accurate 

description of the resonant response to within 1%.18   In this model, the mechanical response for 

a  particular  mode  is  approximated  by  that  of  a  damped  harmonic  oscillator  with  an  effective 

mass, 

effM ,  a  dynamic  stiffness  (for  point  loading  at  the  beam’s  center), 

κ ,  and  a  quality 

eff

factor,  Q.    All  of  these  factors  apply  uniquely  to  the  specific  mode  considered.    For  the 

fundamental-mode  response  of  a  simple  doubly-clamped  beam,  the  effective  mass,  dynamic 

stiffness,  and  the  resonance  frequency  are  given  as

,  respectively.19      Here, 

××

wt

l

  are  the  beam’s  dimensions,  E  is 

Young’s  modulus  and  ρ  is  the  mass  density  of  the  beam.    We  have  assumed  the  material  is 

isotropic; for single-crystal devices anisotropy in the elastic constants will result in a resonance 

frequency that depends upon specific crystallographic orientation. 

In resonant sensing applications, one generally drives the resonator to a predetermined amplitude 

and measures amplitude20 or frequency13 shifts in the steady-state upon changing the resonator’s 

physical  environment.    To  maximize  the  signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR)  one  wishes  to  apply  the 

largest drive level tolerable.  For the sake of concreteness, we assume that this is the maximum 

r.m.s. level, 

cx

, still consistent with producing predominantly linear response.21   For a doubly-

clamped beam, this can be roughly approximated as 

xc

53.0≈

, which depends only upon the

          5  

beam thickness in the direction of vibration.22  A more rigorous definition can be established for 

the  case  of  frequency-stiffening  nonlinearity  induced  by  the  Duffing  instability  for  doubly-

clamped beams.23 

In the simple harmonic oscillator model, both the resonator and the added (accreted) mass, δM, 

are,  to  lowest  order,  approximated  as  point  masses.    Interpreting  real  experiments  with  this 

assumption involves consideration of additional details,24  but these do not qualitatively alter the 

fundamental picture that emerges.   

In Section II of this paper, we develop a detailed formalism for obtaining the mass sensitivity of a 

nanomechanical  resonator.    Mass  sensitivity  limits  imposed  by  various  frequency-fluctuation 

processes in nanomechanical resonators are discussed.  Numerical estimates are obtained for the 

two model realizations of a 1GHz nanomechanical doubly-clamped beam resonator (Table I).  In 

section III, we evaluate these results and present our conclusions. 

II.   ANALYSIS 

In  general,  resonant  mass  sensing  is  performed  by  carefully  determining  the  resonance 

frequency, 

ω ,  of the  resonator  and  then, by  looking  for  a  frequency  shift, 

δω ,  in the  steady 

0

0

state due  to  the  accreted  mass.    Assuming  that this  added  mass,  δM, is  a  small  fraction  of  the 

effective vibratory resonator mass, 

effM , we can write a linearized expression,

This  expression  assumes  that  the  modal  quality  factor  and  compliance  are  not  appreciably 

affected  by  the  accreted  species.    This  is  consistent  with  the  aforementioned  presumption  that 

δ <<

.  Hereafter, we shall refer to δM, as the mass sensitivity or the minimum detectable 

mass of the system.   Apparently,  δM critically depends on the minimum measurable frequency 

shift, 

δω , and the inverse mass responsivity, 

1−ℜ .

Since  the  resonator’s  compliance, 

κ ,  for  the  employed  resonant  mode  —  a  function  of  the 

eff

resonator’s  elastic  properties  and  geometry  —  is  unaffected  by  small  mass  changes,  we  can 

further determine that

We note that Eq. (3) is analogous to the Sauerbrey equation,25 but is instead here written in terms 

of the absolute mass, rather than the mass density, of the accreted species.   

To make further progress, an important question needs to be addressed:  what is the minimum 

measurable frequency shift, 

δω , that can be resolved in a (realistic) noisy system?  In principle,

a shift comparable to the mean square noise (the spread) in an ensemble average of a series of 

frequency  measurements  should  be  resolvable,  i.e.

This, of course, is an approximation to a real system — albeit a good one.  If necessary, one can 

resort to the more accurate expression, Eq. (4).  

Equations (4) and (5) are general expressions.  However, the precise functional form of 

(ωωS
)

 

depends  upon  the  physical  noise  processes  that  are  operative,  as  well  as  the  specific  readout 

process that is employed.  We shall discuss both below. 

A.  Thermomechanical fluctuations 

We first consider the fundamental limit imposed upon mass measurements by thermomechanical 

noise.    These  resonator  fluctuations  are  a  consequence  of  the  fluctuation-dissipation  theorem;

detailed  expositions  can  be  found  elsewhere.26    They  originate  from  thermally-driven  random 

motion  of  the  mechanical  device.    For  the  one-dimensional  simple  harmonic  oscillator

Before proceeding, we reiterate that the manner in which Eq. (5) is evaluated will depend upon 

the  particular  measurement  scheme  implemented.    In  Figure  2,  we  present  schematics  of  two 

common measurement circuits used for frequency tracking in mass sensing applications.  In the 

first  scheme  based  upon  negative  feedback  depicted  in  Fig.  2(a),  small  phase  shifts  of  the 

resonator are tracked through the use of a phase locked loop (PLL) that is driven by a constant-

amplitude  voltage-controlled  oscillator  (VCO).27    Conversely,  in  the  positive  feedback  scheme 

illustrated in Fig. 2(b), the resonator operates within a self-excited loop.    While the final value 

of 

δω   does  not depend upon the particular  measurement  scheme  employed,  the  evaluation  of 

0

the integral and the determination of the appropriate bandwidth does.  In Fig. 2(c), we illustrate 

the  thermomechanical  noise  in  the  resonator  in  relation  to  the  measurement  bandwidth  of  the 

 

 

circuit.

,  can  be  circumvented  by 

employing this self-exciting detection scheme.  

In  Figure  3,  we  plot  Mδ   (Eq.  (10))  as  a  function  of  the  measurement  bandwidth  for  the  two 

model  1  GHz  beam  resonators,  for  two  different  Q  values.    Note  that  mass  sensitivity  in  the 

Dalton  range  is  easily  achievable,  even  for  moderately  large  bandwidths.    As  device  sizes  are 

scaled downward  while maintaining high resonance frequencies,  Meff and κeff  shrink in direct 

proportion.    Devices  with  small  stiffness  (high  compliance)  are  indeed  more  susceptible  to 

thermal  fluctuations  and  consequently,  the  measurement  dynamic  range  is  correspondingly 

reduced.     

B.   Temperature fluctuations 

Given  its  small  heat  capacity,  a  nanomechanical  resonator  can  be  subject  to  rather  large 

temperature fluctuations.  Its susceptibility to such fluctuations depends upon the strength of its 

thermal contact to the environment.14  Since the resonator’s dimensions and material parameters 

are  both  temperature  dependent,  temperature  fluctuations  will  generate  frequency  fluctuations.  

Cleland and Roukes14 have evaluated the spectral density of frequency fluctuations arising from 

temperature fluctuations of a NEMS resonator.  They find that

In Figure 4, we plot the above expression for  Mδ  as a function of the measurement bandwidth 

for  the  1  GHz  doubly-clamped  beams.    Despite  the  role  of  thermal  fluctuations  in  generating 

phase  noise  limitations  to  the  mass  sensitivity,  single-Dalton  sensing  is  readily  achievable.  

Obviously,  the  smaller  incarnations  of  NEMS  are  the  most  susceptible  to  temperature 

fluctuations — and this progressively becomes more significant at elevated temperatures.  This

can  be  circumvented  by  lowering  the  device  temperatures  and  by  optimizing  thermal  contact 

between a NEMS with its environment.   

C.   Adsorption-desorption noise 

Gas  molecules  in  the  vicinity  of  a  resonator  —  each  with  mass,  m  —  can  adsorb  upon  the 

resonator’s surface, mass load the device and, thereby, change its resonant frequency.  Random, 

thermally-driven adsorption and desorption of molecules will therefore induce fluctuations in the 

resonance frequency.   

This so-called adsorption-desorption noise has been discussed in detail by Yong and Vig,29,30 and 

Cleland and Roukes.14    The adsorption-desorption cycle can most conveniently be modeled by a 

flux-dependent  adsorption  rate,

.  Here, p and T are the gas pressure and temperature, respectively. 

bE  is the 

binding  energy  between  the  surface  and  the  adsorbate  atom.    The  adsorption  rate, 

ar ,  depends 

upon  a  phenomenological  coefficient  called  the  sticking  coefficient,  s,  where

Similarly,

ν  is on the

ν

ar   and 

dr  

depend upon the temperature, the nature of the surface and its preparation, the adsorbing species 

—  among  other  sample-specific  factors.    It  is  most  convenient,  therefore,  to  regard  them  as 

phenomenological quantities.

were  used  at  T=300  K.    We  have  also  assumed  an  occupancy  of  approximately  one  adsorbate 
species per surface “site”.  The binding energy of N2 on Si is Eb~10 kcal/mol.31,14,29  At different 
pressures, the correlation time gives the cutoff frequency 1/2πτr in Eq. (15).  

Figure  5  clearly  shows  that  adsorption-desorption  processes  will  not  preclude  attainment  of 

single-Dalton  mass  sensitivity.    Adsorption-desorption  noise  becomes  most  significant  in  the

temperature regime where the adsorption and desorption rates are comparable, hence, for a given 

device configuration, it can be minimized by judicious choice of operating temperature.  Surface 

passivation  to  reduce  the  binding  energy  between  the  molecule  and  the  surface  should  also  be 

effective in this regard.  Given that the adsorption-desorption noise is a surface effect, it becomes 

increasingly important as device sizes shrink. 

 

 

D.   Momentum exchange noise 

We  now  turn  to  a  discussion  of  the  consequences  of  momentum  exchange,  in  a  gaseous 

environment,  between  the  nanomechanical  resonator  and  the  gas  molecules  that  impinge  upon 

it.32    Gerlach  first  investigated  the  effect  of  a  rarefied  gas  surrounding  a  resonant  torsional 

mirror.33    Subsequently,  Uhlenbeck  and  Goudsmit34  calculated  the  spectral  density  of  the 

fluctuating  force  acting  upon  the  mirror  due  to  these  random  collisions.   We  reproduce  here  a 

simplified version of their discussions.  In the molecular regime at low pressure,32 the resonator’s 

(representative) equation of motion takes the form35,36

III.   DISCUSSION 

In  Section  II  we  have  evaluated  the  ultimate  sensitivity  limits  to  mass  sensing  via 

nanomechanical resonators that are imposed by several important noise processes.  Our analysis 

culminates in the expression Eq. (10b),

and its equivalent, Eq. (10a).  Eq. (22) distills and makes transparent the essential considerations 

for optimizing inertial mass sensors – at any size scale.  There are three principal considerations.  

First, the mass responsivity,  ℜ , should be maximal.  As seen from Eq. (2), this emphasizes the 

importance  of  devices  possessing  low  mass,  i.e.  small  volume,  which  operate  with  high 

resonance frequency.  Second, the measurement bandwidth should employ the full range that is 

available.37  Third, the dynamic range for the measurement should be maximized.  At the outset, 

this latter consideration certainly involves careful engineering to minimize what we have termed 

“extrinsic”  noise  processes.    But  this  is  ultimately  feasible  only  down  to  the  point  where 

fundamental limits are reached.  In this regime it is the “intrinsic” noise processes that become 

predominant.    In  this  paper  we  have  evaluated  those  that  are  most  important;  Table  II 

summarizes the corresponding functional forms of noise-limited mass sensitivity that result. 

In Figs. 2 through 6, we have translated these analytical results into concrete numerical estimates 

for the two representative, and realizable configurations of 1GHz doubly-clamped beam silicon 

resonators.    The  implications  of  these  results  are  manifest  –  the  plot  abscissae  span  only  the 

regime from a few tenths, to a few tens of Daltons.  This is the mass range for a small individual 

molecule; hence it is clear that nanomechanical mass sensors offer unprecedented sensitivity.

This  raises  an  important  question:  how  optimally  can  a  nanomechanical  device  perform  for 

sensing species with large mass, say in the megadalton (MDa, i.e. 106 Da) range?  Heretofore, 

our  focus  has  solely  been  upon  the  “mass  noise  floor”,  and  not  on  how  much  can be  accreted 

upon  a  NEMS  mass  sensor  without  degrading  its  performance.    We  will  not  here  carry  out  a 

detailed analysis of the attainable “mass dynamic range” of nanomechanical sensors, but instead 

offer  several  brief  comments.    First,  masses  of  the  resonators  we  consider  are  themselves  of 

order 0.1 to 10 fg  (108 to 1010 Da) – i.e. much greater than that of an individual 1 MDa particle.   

Accretion of hundreds, to hundreds of thousands of such macromolecules would only shift the 

natural (unloaded) resonant frequency downward by about 50%.  At this surface coverage, the 

molecules, which are much more mechanically compliant than silicon, would negligibly perturb 

the dynamic stiffness of the resonator, 

κ .  In fact, for surface coverage below one monolayer, 

eff

one would also expect the resonator’s quality factor to be minimally affected by the adsorbates.  

Accordingly, in addition to their unprecedented mass sensitivity, NEMS mass sensors appear to 

offer  remarkably  large  mass  dynamic  range.    Our  recent  experiments,  reported  elsewhere, 

confirm this.9 

In these recent mass sensitivity measurements,9 extrinsic amplifier noise processes have imposed 

the  dominant  source  of  phase  noise.    Recently,  significant  progress  has  been  made  in  pushing 

this  phase  noise  down  close  to  fundamental  limits.38  With  such  advances,  it  is  clear  that 

nanomechanical  mass  sensing  with  the  single-Dalton  sensitivity  will  be  realizable  in  the  near 

future.    This  will  give  researchers  the  unprecedented  ability  to  weigh  individual  neutral

molecules  routinely  —  blurring the distinction between  conventional  inertial  mass  sensing  and 

mass spectrometry.

22 Our rough criterion for 

cx

 is established in the following way: in a power series expansion 

for  elastic  potential  energy, 

  is  defined  to  be  the  level  at  which  the  first  term  beyond  the 

cx

quadratic  (Hooke’s  law),  grows  to  become  10%  the  size  of  the  second  order  term.    See,  for 

instance, reference 18.

28  Analysis  of  the  more  realistic  case,  i.e.  a  resonator  with  a  noisy  VCO  “drive”,  is 

straightforward and yields no additional, noteworthy insights.  Noise in the drive can be referred 

to the output of the resonator’s transducer, in effect lowering the overall dynamic range.

32 We will only consider the low pressure limit. The expressions in the text will not be valid for 

high pressures, where the dissipation is due to the viscous forces of the fluid.  Yet, the crossover 

to the viscous regime for small, high frequency resonators takes place at higher pressures.  This 

crossover pressure can be determined by comparing the sound wavelength in the medium to the 

mean free path of the gas molecules.  The mean free path, 

λ ,  in a gaseous environment with 

mfp

molecules modeled as hard spheres is given by 

λ =
mfp

, where d0 is the sphere diameter,

p

T the temperature and p the pressure of the gas;  kB is Boltzmann’s constant.  Wavelength of the 

sound  waves  around  the  operation  frequency  of  the  resonator  can  be  estimated  from  a  linear 

dispersion.  One can then determine that for a nanomechanical resonator at 1GHz, this crossover 

pressure is larger than atmospheric pressure.  For more details, see, for example, V.B. Braginsky, 

V.P.  Mitrofanov  and  V.I.  Panov,  Systems  with  Small  Dissipation  (The  University  of  Chicago

37 In the presence of feedback, this consideration is modified to involve effective (closed-loop) 

Q, rather than the natural (open-loop) Q, since the former will then determine the bandwidth.

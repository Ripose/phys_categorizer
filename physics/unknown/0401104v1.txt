Abstract
—The purpose of the present work is a theoretical examination of how localized skin-tissue dehydra-
tion affects the depth of the confocal probing and what depth of effective detection can be reached with the
chemical administration of skin tissues. A semi-inﬁnite multilayer Monte Carlo model is used to estimate spa-
tial localization of the output signal offered by a confocal probe. A solution of glycerol is taken in the capacity
of innocuous osmotic agent. Diffusion of this bio-compatible chemical agent into the skin temporarily pushes
water out of the tissues and results in the matching of the refractive indices of skin structural elements. This
temporarily decreases scattering and increases transparency of topical skin layers, which allows for unrestricted
light to permeate deeper into the skin. The results of simulation show that signal spatial localization offered by
a confocal probe in the skin tissues during their clearing is usable for the monitoring of deep reticular dermis
and improving the image contrast and spatial resolution. A discussion of the optical properties of skin tissues
and their changes due to diffusion of glycerol into the skin is given. Optical properties of tissues and their
changes due to chemical administration are estimated based on the results of experimental in vitro study with
rat and human skin.

1.  INTRODUCTION

The unique characteristics of optical/laser methods
are of great interest to researchers working in various
areas of biology and medicine [1, 2]. Nevertheless, the
problem  of  implementing  these  techniques  in  clinical
practice in order to solve a wide range of actual diag-
nostic  tasks  remains  unresolved.  The  difﬁculties  in
clinical application are due to highly anisotropic scat-
tering of the probing laser radiation in most biological
tissues.  Furthermore,  random  inhomogeneous  varia-
tions of the optical properties of the topical skin layers
act  like  a  screen,  which  keeps  stray  optical  radiation
from penetrating deeply into the human body [3]. The
mathematical expression for the propagation of optical
radiation describing these conditions is complex. Prac-
tically,  it  is  extremely  difﬁcult  to  distinguish  regular
waves  corresponding  to  internal  structure  of  the
medium  or  individual  characteristics  of  the  scattering
particles.

Diffusive injection of some chemical agents in bio-
logical tissues results in reduced light scattering [4–6].
The  preliminary  experiments  on  rat  skin  [5,  7–9],
where  glucose,  glycerol,  trazograph,  polyethylen  gly-
col, cosmetic lotions, and gels were taken in the capac-
ity  of  innocuous  bio-compatible  chemical  agents,
showed that diffusion of the chemicals into skin tempo-
rary  pushes  water  out  of  the  upper  skin  tissues.  This
causes matching of the refractive indices of the struc-
tural elements of skin cells and temporarily increases
the  transparency  of  upper  skin  layers,  which  in  turn
allows the unrestricted light to permeate deeper into tis-

sues. The  augment  of  the  transparency  of  skin  layers
typically  increases  for  10–40  minutes,  depending  on
the  chemical  agent.  Then,  due  to  the  physiological
response of the organism, water content of skin tends
back to its initial level, and the transparent skin returns
to normal. Nevertheless, this temporal gap of scattering
reduction  can  signiﬁcantly  improve  the  efﬁciency  of
skin image reconstruction techniques, such as confocal
microscopy  or  optical  coherence  tomography  (OCT),
for instance, and provide information that is not avail-
able  for  dermatologists  and  other  researchers  at  the
present time. However, an assessment of the depth to
which we can penetrate into the skin by optical probing
during  administration  of  chemicals  to  skin  tissues  is
required.

The goal of the present work is to examine how the
localized dehydration of skin tissues affects the depth
of confocal probing and what effective detection depth
can  be  reached  with  such  chemical  administration  of
skin tissues.

2.  MATERIALS AND  METHODS

Stochastic numerical modeling is used to study the
spatial  localization  of  the  output  signal  of  a  confocal
probe  within  human  skin  tissues.  The  basis  for  this
technique is the Monte Carlo (MC) approach [10, 11],
which excludes the energy conservation problem inher-
ent to the previous MC algorithms [12–14]. The details
of the technique are justiﬁed below. The confocal prob-
ing  is  simulated  following  the  ray-tracing  approach

of human skin cells, as well as the spatial distribution
of chromophores, pigments, and blood vessels [16–18].
We  subdivide  the  epidermis  into  two  sublayers
called  nonliving  and  living  epidermis.  Nonliving  epi-
m thick), con-
dermis, or stratum corneum (about 20 
sists  of  only  dead  squamous  cells,  which  are  highly
keratinized with a high lipid and protein content, and
has  a  relatively  low  water  content  [17].  This  content
deﬁnes the density of average absorption and scattering
cross-sections for the layer. Living epidermis (~100 
m
thick) contains most of the skin pigmentation, mainly
melanin, which is produced in the melanocytes. Large
melanin  particles  such  as  melanosomes  (>300  nm  in
diameter)  exhibit  mainly  forward  scattering.  In  con-
trast, melanin dust, whose particles are small (<30 nm
in  diameter),  has  anisotropy  in  the  scattering  proﬁle,
the  optical  properties  of  melanin  particles
and 
−
(30
300 nm in diameter) can be predicted by the Mie
theory. Random spatial distribution of melanin particles
in  living  epidermis  affects  both  the  scattering  and
absorption properties of human skin [19].

Derma is a vascularised layer, and the main absorb-
ers are the blood-bone pigments hemoglobin, carotene,
and bilirubin. The optical properties of derma, mainly
absorption, depend on the distribution of blood contain-
ing  haemoglobin.  Following  the  distribution  of  blood
vessels in skin [16, 18] we subdivide dermis into four
m thick), upper blood
layers: papillary dermis (~150 
net plexus (~100 
m
thick) and deep blood net plexus (~100 
m thick). Scat-
tering properties of dermal layers are mainly deﬁned by
the ﬁbrous structure of the tissue, where collagen ﬁbers
are packed in collagen bundles and have lamellae struc-
ture  [16]. The  light  scatters  on  both  single  ﬁbers  and
scattering centers, which are formed by the interplace-
ment of collagen ﬁbers.

Table 1 outlines the summarized optical properties
of  skin  layers.  These  properties  correspond  to  the
intrinsic  optical  parameters  of  normal  human  skin
(Caucasian type) at 633-nm wavelength. The refractive
index of external medium is 1.0 (air), whereas for the
deepest area it is assumed to be the same as for subcu-
taneous fat.

The  diffusion  of  exogenous  chromophores  or  bio-
compatible chemical agents into the skin results in the
matching of refractive indices of scattering elements of
skin tissues and interstitial ﬂuid of its tissue [1]. There-
upon, the path-length in a forward direction for the inci-
dent radiation increases as the unrestriction of incident
light  on  the  refractive-index  mismatching  boundaries
decreases. This plays a signiﬁcant role for the shallow
optical probes [10, 20].

It should be pointed out that direct measurements of
the optical properties of the skin layers described above
are  impossible.  We  estimate  the  changes  in  optical
properties  of  the  skin  layers  based  on  their  chro-
mophores content and micro structure [16–18] typical
for normal human skin.

Difference in blood and lymph-vessel distribution,
cell structure, and packing of the collagen ﬁber bundles
within  the  skin  produces  complex  oscillations  in  the
diffusion of glycerol (
 = 1.45) and other agents within
n
the skin tissues. We assume that the scattering proper-
ties of blood-containing layers become nonlinear due to
blood ﬂow (and also due to lymph ﬂow), which period-
ically washes away a part of an osmotic agent. In the
model,  we  also  emphasize  that  the  dermal–epidermal
junction and variations of size and packing of topical
skin  cells  and  collagen  ﬁber  bundles  produce  spatial
variations in the glycerol concentration. This is repre-
sented  schematically  in  Fig.  2.  Stratum  corneum
greatly clears in the ﬁrst minute of the process [8, 21].
It is connected mainly with an immersion of dead cells
just  after  administering  the  agent.  Then,  diffusion  is
dramatically reduced due to the barrier produced by the

Current model was used to calculate axial focusing

a few values of confocal focusing. The obtained change
in  the  detection-signal  distributions  is  proportionally

the  effective  path-length  distributions
through the tissue and/or to the glycerol concentration

separately for each focusing depth and stage of glycerol

pare). Spatially, the detector signal offered by a confo-
cal  probe  is  localized  mainly  around  the  focal  plane
area for all depths of focusing (see Fig. 5).

4.  DISCUSSIONS AND  CONCLUSIONS

Using  a  simple  numerical  method,  we  have  esti-
mated what depth is preferentially sensitive for a con-
focal probing during clearing of skin tissue by glycerol.
The results of the simulation show that the spatial local-
ization  offered  by  a  confocal  probe  in  skin  due  to  its
clearing is potentially usable for monitoring upper der-
mal layers, i.e., three times deeper than original prob-
ing depth. The present computational model could not
consider  the  dynamics  of  the  changes  in  skin-tissue
optical properties, which is an important factor. Never-
theless,  in  the  framework  of  the  simulation,  we  have
estimated the optical properties of skin layers based on
experimental measurements of the glycerol diffusion of
skin  tissue  [1,  8,  21]  and  taken  into  account  the
observed structure of skin tissues. We emphasize that
hypodermal  injection  of  bio-compatible  chemical
agents increases the speed of the tissue clearing, since
this agent diffuses straight into the dermal layers with
the exception of the barriers, whereas, for topical super-
ﬁcial  administering  of  skin  tissues,  the  diffusion  pro-
cesses are slow, and the time of clearing is signiﬁcantly
(~10 times) longer. We will present these data in future

reports  upon  ﬁnal  establishment  of  the  geometry
changes of skin layers.

The  obtained  results  can  be  useful  to  evaluate  the
capabilities of skin-imaging systems based on confocal
probing. The current approach has the potential to dra-
matically  improve  the  speciﬁcity  of  visual  diagnostic
techniques  such  as  colposcopy,  ﬂuorescence  micros-
copy, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and other
medical  diagnostic  techniques  and  could  be  useful  in
laser surgery as well.

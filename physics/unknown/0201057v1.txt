QUANTIZATION OF MASSES IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 

By A. M. Ilyanok and I. A. Timoshchenko. 

The hypothesis of quantization of masses of the solar system planets is considered. It is 
supposed that the solar system was bearing during the Protosun squeezing from the red giant 
to a yellow dwarf. According to mass and orbit redistribution of interior planets the condition 
of  the  origin  of  satellites  of  internal  and  external  planets  located  in  the  ecliptic  plane  are 
found.  It  is  shown,  that  the  main  source  of  substance  for  these  satellites  and  majority  of 
meteorites and asteroids in the solar system is mantle and bark of the Mars separated from it 
under  influence  of  gravitation  forces  about  4  billion  years  ago,  caused  by  squeezing  of  the 
sun  and  Jupiter.  In  these  condition  there  is  a  probability  of  contamination  of  the  Earth  by 
DNA of living organisms from Mars. It is shown that Uranus and Neptune were formed as a 
result  of  protosaturn  decay.  It  is  found  that  from  all  external  planets  only  Uranus  has  the 
large cavity inside. As a result there is no internal power source, and the considerable shift of 
a magnetic axis relative to rotate axis is observed. 

1. Introduction. 

In  paper  [1]  the  new  approach  to  describing  physical  phenomena  is  given.  For 
comparison  of  experimental  data  in  different  branches  of  physics  the  universal    measuring 
tool - dimensionless scale is used. It is following:

2. Interior planets of the solar system. 

Let us consider, that after formation the planets had velocities and big semiaxis, exactly 
describing by formulas (2) and (3). According to relations (4) and (5), their values should not 
vary, because the fundamental constants do not vary. But from present experiment we have 
displacement of planets and change of their velocities relative to the theoretical values. How 
it could take place? 

The present models of the solar system formation consider its formation from gaseous 
and dust clouds. Thus, it is considered, that cooling down the sun would turn to the red giant. 
However there are no direct experimental proof of this model both in the solar system, and on 
other  stars.  Therefore  alternative  versions  of  the  solar  system  development  can  have  place. 
One of them was present by Egyed L. Developing his ideas, we suggest that the solar system 
had  originated  from  center  of  the  Galaxy.  Originally  it  consist  of  three  stars  that  were  red 
giants  (cid:150)  protosun,  protojupiter  and  protosaturn.  Protojupiter  and  protosaturn  was  separated 
from protosun and promptly had faded, and transformed to planets consisting mainly of liquid 
hydrogen. The sun continued to be squeezed, and at present it is a yellow dwarf. 

In paper [2] it is shown that the sun represents a hollow star. Its shell has a density of 
12.97  g/cm3  and  consists  of  liquid  atomic  hydrogen  with  helium  dissolved  in  it.  And  their 
gaseous  mixture  under  the  pressure  of  0.1  atmosphere  fills  the  cavity.  At  periodic  quantum 
squeezing of protosun it formed new planets in equatorial plane. These planets had an orbital 
velocity of equal equatorial velocity of protosun at the moment of birth. 

It  is  possible  to  consider  the  similar  model  of  satellites  formation  of  external  planets. 
Let us remark, that the planets in this case genetically connect with the sun and rotate in its 
equator  plane.  Therefore  satellites  of  external  planets,  genetically  connected  with  them, 
should rotate in plane of planet equator. If a satellite is caught from space, it will be rotate in 
ecliptic plane. At rotational displacement of planet axis, at its motion around the sun satellites 
only  genetically  connected  with  it  will  be  turned  round  in  the  equator  plane  of  planet.  The 
entrapped satellites will remain near to a plane of ecliptic. Earlier these facts did not meet a 
theoretical explanation. 

Let us summarize masses of internal planets. It is:

It is equal to sum of masses of Moon, Triton (satellite of Neptune), Japetus (satellite of 
Saturn),  both  meteorites  and  masses  of  small  planets  and  meteorites  moving  in  plane  of 
ecliptic.  The  orbits  of  a  Triton  and  Japetus  are  also  in  ecliptic  plane.  As  such  considerable 
mass  could  not  come  from  the  outside,  it  is  possible  to  conclude,  that  it  was  distributed  on 
internal  planets.  And  after  some  cataclysm  its  distribution  had  become  like  at  present.  This 
mass  redistribution  had  lead  to  displacement  of  orbit  and  average  orbital  velocities  (see 
Table). 

Moon

 

According to the paper [1], at the moment of (cid:147)birth(cid:148) the Earth radius was 

, 

where G is gravitational constant It was less on 115 km the present average radius. 

As the mantle density of the Earth (3,4 g/cm3) is close to average density of the Moon 

(3,34 g/cm3), further all calculations make relative mass and density of the Moon.  

The simple calculation has shown that mass of the Earth shell by width of 115 km equal 
.  Thus,  the  Earth,  (to  fill  deficiency  in  a  mass),  caught  a  celestial

But whence this mass has appeared? According to fact that the Mercury(cid:146)s orbit was not 
changed it can be consider that the diameter of the sun was equal to diameter of Mercury(cid:146)s 
orbit at the moment of a cataclysm, it means that the sun was red giant. 

Let  us  remark  that  the  average  density  of  Mars  (3,95  g/cm3)  is  close  to  average  bark 
densities of the Earth and the Moon. It can be supposed that the Moon takes its origin from 
the Mars. What could make the Mars to be torn? The powerful exterior gravitation effect had 
all chances of it. At present equatorial velocity of the sun rotation less then the Jupiter one in 

2π times. The equatorial velocity of the Jupiter equal

538

 km/sec, and average 

densities  of  the  sun  (1.408  g/cm3)  and  the  Jupiter  (1.330  g/cm3)  are  close.  Therefore  the 
Jupiter  could  be  the  second  star  of  the  solar  system.  Suppose  that  protomars  located  in  the 
mass center of this double star-shaped system, it is possible to find (according to the theory 
[1])  mass  and  diameter  of  the  protojupiter  at  that  time.  In  addition  it  is  supposed  that 
gravitational constant changes in dependence on phase state of substance and its temperature. 
The  ratio  of  distances  from  protomars  up  to  protojupiter  and  from  protomars  up  to  the

less  solar  one  that  exceeds  a  present  mass  of  Jupiter  in  443.3  times  at  the  expense  of 
gravitational constant change.  If  average densities are considered to be invariable, radius of 
3/1
Jupiter in that time exceeded present in 
 times, that there is less radius of the 
nowadays sun on 28 %.

Thus,  at  the  moment  of  catastrophe  in  the  solar  system  on  the  sky  of  protomars  there 
were two stars: the red giant by the size, equal diameter of  orbit of the Mercury, and yellow 
dwarf with the size, on 28 % smaller present size of the sun. Before cataclysm the protomars 
had  the  mass  combined  from  following  masses:  the  present  mass  of  the  Mars  equal  8.702 
MMoon, part with mass of 3.776 MMoon which had flown to the Earth and mass of the satellite 
entrapped in a plane of ecliptic by other planets. This is mass of the Triton equal 0.8 MMoon, 
mass  of  the  Japetus  equal  0.026  MMoon  and  total  masses  of  meteorites  and  small  planets 
moving  in  ecliptic  plane  equal  0.0244  MMoon.  Masses  of  natural  satellites  Mars  Phobos  and 
Deymos are neglectfully small. In addition the shape of these satellites is so unsymmetrical, 
that  testifies  to  origin  of  them  not  from  liquid  matter  of  mantle,  but  from  a  solid  bark  of 

 

3 

protomars.  In  result  it  is  considered,  that  the  primary  mass  of  protomars  was  13.32  MMoon. 
After  a  disrupture  protomars  lost  a  kinetic  energy,  and  its  orbit  was  canted  to  an  equatorial 
plane of the sun on 5,15° and was displaced to more low level on 3.94 million km. It became 
promptly rotate around its axis, and the axis turned relatively to orbital plane on 25.  

Figure. The Moon motion after its separating from protomars. 

In  addition  the  important  fact  is,  that  equatorial  radius  of  Mars,  equal  3395  km  [3], 
differs all on 2.7 % from radius of an exterior core of the Earth, equal 3485.7 km. If imagine, 

that the internal structure of protomars before a disrupture resembled structure of the Earth, 
i.e. had a hot core, liquid mantle and bark, but in other proportions. Then at a disrupture of 
protomars it lost liquid mantle and solid bark. A part of this bark as its asymmetric satellites 
Phobos  and  Deymos  we  observed  now.  And  satellites  are  rotated  in  an  equatorial  plane  of 
Mars, that shows their birth from a subsoil of protomars. It is possible, that before the Mars 
disrupture there were conditions for life existence. Because Mars is older than the Earth on 1-
2  billion  years,  the  forms  of  this  life  should  be  rather  high.  After  a  disrupture  of  protomars 
there was a probability that the pieces of this life as DNA came to the Earth, Venus and some 
satellites of exterior planets. May be only on the Earth the conditions of further development 
marsian life were favourable. 

Let  us  consider  the  events  development  after  disrupture  of  the  protomars.  The  part  of 
protomars  with  mass  of  3.766  MMoon  began  to  drop  on  the  sun  (see  Fig.).  This  part  at  the 
initial  moment  should  have  speed,  sufficient  for  a  escape  from  a  gravitational  field  of 
protomars.  The  escape  velocity  of  protomars  in  that  time  was  6.3  km/sec.  Flying  up  to  an 
orbit of Venus, this part had  velocity 11.97 km/sec, equal difference of orbital velocities of 
Venus  and  Mars.  Near  Venus,  this  fraction  had  obtained  velocity,  equal  18.27 km/sec 
relatively  to  Venus.  There  was  a  contact  impact  between  Venus  and  this  body.  But  as  its 
velocity  was  more  than  escape  velocity  on  a  surface  of  Venus  (10.25  km/sec),  this  body, 
recoiled from Venus, could turn in the opposite direction (cid:150) to the Earth. At such contact the 
direction of Venus rotation around its axis could vary to opposite one, what we observed now. 
Besides the orbital plane of Venus also was displaced relatively to equatorial plane of the sun 
on 3,62°. In this case there was an off-centre inelastic impact of two bodies. As follows from 
the table of orbital velocities, Venus had been given adding energy, and the major semiaxis of 
its orbit increased on 5.16 million km.  

The  rejected  body  began  to  move  in  the  direction  of  the  Earth  with  an  initial  radial 
speed  no  more  than  8  km/sec.  It  is  complicated  to  define  this  value  precisely,  so  it  is 
necessary  to  calculate  a  coefficient  of  restitution,  i.e.  to  find  a  share  of  energy,  which 
transformed  in  in  thermal  energy  and  rotational  one  around  Venus  axis.  Flying  up  to  the 
Earth, the radial speed of a body was 0.84 km/sec or less, and essentially body came to the 
same orbit, on which one the Earth moved. Further the body was entrapped by gravitational 
forces,  and  began  to  drop  on  the  Earth  with  the  second  solar  escape  velocity  for  an  earth

surface.  10.93  km/sec.  After  impact  with  the  Earth,  the  body  together  with  it  displaced  on 
more  low-altitude  orbit  -  on  11.4  million  km.  Thus  the  difference  between  theoretical  and 
experimental orbital velocities of the Earth was 1.05 km/sec. At the impact to the Earth a part 
of  the  body  broken  away  and  became  a  Earth  satellite  (cid:150)  the  Moon  with  average  orbital 
velocity  of  1,05  km/sec.  At  the  impact  to  the  Earth  velocity  of  its  rotation  around  axis 
considerably increased. And axis has turned on 23° relatively to orbital plane. Orbital plane 
also displaced from an equatorial plane of the sun on 7°. In addition the declination of a lunar 
orbit  to  an  ecliptic  makes  5,15°,  and  orbit  of  Mars  1,85°,  the  sum  of  angles  is  7°.  This 
magnitude coincides with inclination angle of the Earth orbit to plane of solar equator. 

As now average orbital velocity of the Moon is1.023 km/sec, it is possible to consider, 
that Moon had kept away from the Earth on 5.3 % - 20.5 thousand km for 4 billion years or 
5,1  mm  per  one  year.  In  this  case  energy  of  the  Earth  is  transmitted  to  Moon.  This  fact  is 
observed  experimentally  on  the  Earth  as  an  exceeds  of  humps  of  tidal  bores  in  ocean.  This 
wave exceeds motion of axis linked centres of the Earth and the Moon on 2.16° [5].   

Other part of protomars moved in the direction of Jupiter. It was represented group of 
liquid and solid pieces. Large planets entrapped the small-sized parts. They can be observed 
by  us  as  satellites  of  planets  on  high-altitude  orbits,  which  one  are  move  close  to  plane  of 
ecliptic.  Two  large  pieces  were  entrapped  by  Saturn  and  Neptune  is  Japetus  and  Triton 
accordingly. As the  declination of the Mars orbit relatively to plane of ecliptic is 1.85° and 
Neptune one is 1.77°, the probability of Triton capture by Neptune is rather high. At possible 
impact of a Triton on Neptune a chunk from Neptune has presumably broken away. It had left 
on a self-maintained orbit. The plane of this orbit is considerably (on 17°) deflects from plane 
of ecliptic. We know it as Pluto. Triton began rotate in the counter party relatively gyration of 
Neptune. Thus the orbits of Neptune and Pluto should be intersected in a point of collision, 
that we observe. 

3. External planets of the solar system. 

Let  us  remark,  that  the  sum  of  masses  of  Saturn,  Uranus  and  Neptune  make  127,0 
masses of the Earth. Besides according to the table major displacement of Saturn took place, 
and  rather  small  aberrations  of  orbits  of  Uranus  and  Neptune  from  quantum  one  had  taken 
place. It is possible to consider that earlier protosaturn represented a planet by a mass in 127 
MEarth. It composed of modern Uranus and Neptune. Last one represented more dense core of 
the  Protosaturn  (densities  of  Saturn  equals  0,69  g/cm3,  Uranus  equals  1,64  g/cm3,  Neptune 
equals  1,26 g/cm3).  Probably  about  4  billion  years  ago  during  sharp  transition  of  the 
prpotojupiter and the protosun in a new quantum state (presumptively diminution of the sizes 
of  the  protosun  from  the  sizes  of  an  orbit  of  Venus  down  to  an  orbit  of  a  Mercury)  the 
strongest  gravitation  perturbations  beat  out  a  core  (Uranus  and  Neptune)  from  protosaturn. 
Thus the Saturn came near to the sun on 221,6 million km. 

Let  us  suppose  that  the  energy  lost  by  protosaturn  was  spent  to  displace  Uranus  and 
Neptune to their modern orbits. According to calculations, only this energy does not sufficient 
for  displacement of Uranus and Neptune. We consider that the necessary part of energy was 
taken from energy of planet rotation, which coincides on an order of magnitude total kinetic 
energy of Saturn motion. 

Presuming that the planets have a cavity inside, according to paper [2] the squeezing of 

a planet is determined by following expression: 

                                                    σ

where ω  is  angular  velocity  of  a  planet,  M  is  its  mass,  r1  is  hollow  radius,  R  is    Substitute 
experimentally obtained data of planets squeezing from [3] in the Eq. (9), and we discover the 
roots  of  a  polynomial  of  the  fifth  degree  rather  r1/R  in  limits  of  [0,1].  For  the  Saturn  and

,  and  for  Uranus  equals  0,72.  Thus  as  a  first  approximation  for  Saturn  and 

Neptune the matter focused closer to centre of a planet, and Uranus has cavity of radius not 
less than 18300 km. It is possible, that Saturn and Neptune has small central cavities similar 
to an internal core of the Earth [1]. 

According  to  [5]  Saturn  and  Neptune  is  radiated more energy, than  immerse from the 
sun.  And  for  Uranus  the  balance  of  immersed  and  radiated  energy  is  observed,  and  its 
effective temperature equals 55K. It testifies to existence of internal power source for Saturn 
and Neptune and absence those for Uranus.  

Uranus  has  major  enough  cavity  inside.  There  are  the  electric  currents  creating  a 
magnetic field in the cavity. Probably, the currents flow not on equator of the cavity, but are 
shifted.  Thereof  its  magnetic  axis  also  considerably  shifted  relatively  to  the  centre  of  the 
Uranus. By analogy with paper [1] temperature inside Uranus can be calculated as motion of a 
current of electrons relatively to Protons.

where k is Boatsman constant, me is electron mass, vI is first solar escape velocity on a surface 
of Mars, which experimental value is equal to 5.6 km/sec. It is necessary to mark that α2c = 
15.964  km/sec  and  it  practically  coincides  the  first  solar  escape  velocity  on  a  surface  of 
Uranus. From here follows, that interior temperature of Uranus gives the minor contribution 
in comparison to energy immersed from the sun, which equals 47K. Analogously it is possible 
to calculate temperature of other external planets, but it is necessary to take into account, that 
the measurings of effective temperature are carried out with a major error because of a cloudy 
coverage of these planets. 

There is a problem: whether not protosaturn similarly to the protosun could to pass in a 
following quantum state, left Uranus, which (cid:147)had thrown out(cid:148) the Neptune? Whether present 
by itself Saturn, Uranus and Neptune a time sweep of a damping star protosaturn? 

4. Conclusions 

The consequences of the new scientific approach introduced in paper [1] with reference 
to  planets  the  solar  system  are  explored.  For  internal  planets  the  hypothesis  explaining 
changes  of  their  orbits  and  redistribution  of  their  masses  as  of  quantum  numbers  is 
represented. Is shown, that the consequences of the theory are the possibility of the protomars 
disrupture under an acting of gravitation forces of the protosun and the protoJupiter at their 
united  squeezing.  Thus  the  part  of  protomars  moving  in  the  direction  of  the  sun,  was 
entrapped by the Earth (including the Moon), other part has formed an asteroid belt and some 
satellites  of  exterior  planets  of  the  solar  system.  Is  shown,  that  the  part  of  protomars  was 
entrapped by Neptune as the satellite called as Triton, and at their impact Pluto was formed. 

The ideas to a problem on a origin of Uranus and Neptune, as constituents damping star 
(cid:150)  Protosaturn  are  expressed.  Is  shown,  that from  all exterior planets only  Uranus has  major 
cavity inside. As a corollary it there is no interior power source, and the considerable bias of a 
magnetic axis concerning a rotation axis is observed. 

In  further  it  is  necessary  to  improve  calculation  of  redistribution  of  orbits  of  external 
planets at the expense of interchanging between them by momentum and masses. It will give 
the possibility to track process of fading of stars more precisely.

Abstract 

The wire method is a more rapid and less costly method 

to measure impe dances of RF components compared to 
methods using a beam. A setup using a single displaced 
wire to excite and measure transverse resonant modes in 
accelerating structures for the Next Linear Collider/ 
Japanese Linear Collider (NLC/JLC) has been built. The 
RF signal is coupled into and out of the structure using 
two matching sections with a broadband frequency from 
11 to 18 GHz. Their contribution to the scattering 
parameter is minimized by a calibration technique. A 
standing wave structure has been measured. Difficulties in 
accurately predicting the modal loss factors were 
encountered related to the approximations made and to 
experimental issues. The measurements are presented and 
comparisons with simulations are made. 

INTRODUCTION 
Wake fields in accelerat ing structures are the main cause 
of transverse beam emittance growth in high energy 
accelerators. By appropriate design of the accelerating 
structures and absorption of electromagnetic energy, they 
must be brought below a limit where the effect on the 
beam is acceptable. Therefore their understanding is 
essential. Although modern computer codes have proved 
to give reliable results, measurements are important as 
well. 

Direct measurements of wake potentials imply studying 
their interaction with a beam. Measu rements in the time 
domain have been made for example at the ASSET setup 
at SLAC on X -band accelerating structures [1], while at 
TTF at DESY individual dipole modes have been studied 
[2]. The results of these types of measurements are in 
h theoretical predictions [3]. 
good agreement wit
Nevertheless they require long preparation times and 
costly beam time. Bench -top measurements are made by 
perturbing the field with a small bead [4] or by 
propagating  RF through a coaxial line made of the 
structure and one or two thin wires [5]. 

In this paper we present first frequency

-domain 

measurements using the wire method on a 11.4 GHz 
standing-wave structure in study for the NLC/JLC [6]. 
Results are discussed and comparisons with simulations 
are made. 

METHOD 
Since their  proposal in the 1970s,  time domain [7] and 
frequency domain [8] wire measurements have been made

for various microwave components. In time domain the 
method requires current pulses of a length shorter or 
comparable to the length of the bunches used in that
structure. Therefore we chose to study individual modes 
in frequency domain. The wire method theory is rather 
well established for resistive wall wakefields and modes 
below cut -off. Several approximations exist for lumped 
and distributed impedances [9]. A ttention must be paid 
particularly when these conditions are not met. 

 

Setup 

The measurement setup is shown in Fig. 1. The signal 

from a network analyzer is matched to the ports of the 
structure through two specially designed sections 
containing adapters from rectangular waveguides (WR62) 
to coax. These have a broad band from about 11 to 
 
18 GHz. The wire is inserted through the adapter and can 
be displaced by slightly bending the thin coax tubes. We 
chose this solution in order to minimize discontinuities i n 
the structure.

The wire is made of brass and has a diameter of 

 

300  m m. Compared to previous measurements in single 
cell cavities, the wire diameter has been increased in order 
to provide a better contact. This has improved the stability 
and reproducibility of the transmission curves. For the 
same reason, the flanges of th e matching sections have 
been modified to eliminate the gaskets. The reflection of 
the matching sections is better than –30 dB. 

TRL calibration 

In order to obtain measurements that are hardly affected 

by the imperfections of the matching sections, we 
calibrated the measurements at the ports of the matching 
sections connecting to the device under test (DUT). For 
this we used a TRL (through
-reflect-line) technique in 
which only a few parameters of the calibration standards 
need to be precisely known [10]. A  delay line and an RF 
short were required to be built especially for this setup. 
The third standard is a through measurement. With this 
method one does not need to know precisely the reflection 
of the short, or the length of the delay line. 

An alternative  was to calibrate the network analyzer 
directly by modifying a calibration kit for a coaxial line to 
fit the parameters of our setup. Fig. 2 shows the 
agreement of the calibration results obtained with these 
two methods. The DUT is here a single cell structure. 

monopole passband between about 11.8 and 12.5 GHz. It 
remains essentially unchanged with changing wire offset. 
All modes at higher frequencies are from the first and 

second dipole passbands in interaction with the TEM 
coaxial mode. The  amplitude of the peaks change s with 
the wire position. One can see that they are smallest for a 
wire offset around 0.5 mm. The frequency of the modes 
also shifts as the displacement of the wire changes . In the 
limit of zero wire offset, the frequenc

Standing-wave structure 

A standing wave structure was measured in this setup 
(see Fig. 1). It consists of 15 cells  which, prior to tuning, 
are identical. The structure is fed through the middle cell 
by a symmetrical coupler.  
The main contribution to 

the transverse wake field is 

given by the first 3 dipole passbands [11]. The setup 
allows us to measure the first two bands plus the 
fundamental monopole band. 

RESULTS 
The two ends of the wire were approximately centered.

Then the wire was displaced using 
micrometers with respect to this position. Moving the 
wire rather than measuring at a fixed position allows us to 
reduce statistical errors. Moreover , one can fit data and 
ascertain the loss factor in the limit of centered wire [12]. 
At the  same time the alignment of the wire can be based 
on the dipole signal.

Comparison to simulations 

The properties of the standing wave structure have been 
simulated with the HFSS code (High Frequency Structure 
Simulator). The S -parameters of a single cell and of the 
end cell plus the  beam pipe were obtained. A wire with 
300 mm in diameter was placed 1 mm off -center. Using a 
cascading technique, the result for a 15 -cell structure was 
obtained [13]. 

Fig. 4 compares the simulation with the measurement 
made for a relative wire displacement
 of 0 mm which 
seems to match it best. The agreement for the monopole 
band is good apart from a frequency shift. This is due to 
neglecting the input coupler in the simulations. Also the 
actual structure was tuned to obtain a flat accelerating 
field. 

The di pole bands are more difficult to compare. They 
depend strongly on the alignment of the wire and clearly

also play a role.

The coupling impedance and the loss factors of the 
structure are related to the S -parameters. The correlation 
is neverthe less not straightforward for accelerating 
structures. The theory is rather well established for 
lumped impedances, and for distributed impedances, 
below cut-off. Further studies are in progress in this sense. 

SUMMARY 

Initial wire measurements of a NLC/JLC 

accelerating 
structure have been undertaken. Special matching sections 
have been designed and built in order to allow for a 
relatively easy mounting and displacement of a thin brass 
wire. A TRL calibration technique gives good results 
when applied directly on the network analyzer, as well as 
post-measurement. By moving the wire, excitation of 
dipole modes was observed. The simulations show good 
agreement with the measured monopole band, and give a 
qualitative comparison for the dipole. Nevertheless better 
wire tilt alignment is needed. Further investigations on 
inferring the coupling impedance of the dipole bands is 
under way.

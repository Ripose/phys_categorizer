On the Origin of Time

Ernst Karl Kunst

Herein it is shown that mass and time in the rest frame as well as relativistically
enlarged  mass  and  dilated  time  in  the  moving  frame  are  of  like  origin.  This
implies  that  the  former  are  generated  by  the  movement  of  a  fourth  spatial
dimension of matter relative to a four-dimensional manifold.

Key words: Special relativity - equivalence of mass and time - fundamental length -
quantum of time - fourth dimension

In the previous work on quantization of velocity, length and time it has been proven
that among others Einstein’s “relativity of simultaneity” [1] rests on a misinterpretation
of the principle of relativity and the correct interpretation of the Lorentz transformation
to predict an expansion dx’ = dx(cid:11)  of the dimension (dx) parallel to the velocity-vector
of  moving  bodies  -  where  (cid:11)   is  the  Lorentz  factor  based  on  quantized  velocity  v   -
rather  than  the  so  called  FitzGerald-Lorentz  contraction  [2].  Furthermore,  this
relativistic expansion of dx has been shown to imply that '' = ' - density of mass in the
moving frame and in the rest frame, respectively - and, thus, to be the cause of the
relativistic rise of energy or mass m  = dt'v /c = dt (cid:11) v /c, where m  is mass due to time
dilation  and  dt   =  dx/c.  In  connection  with  the  definition  of  action  as  the  product  of
energy and time the result also has been derived that a smallest or fundamental length
(cid:27)  = (cid:8)h and a quantum of time -  = (cid:8)h/c exists and that  apart from a numerical factor
0
in the case of the hydrogen (H-) atom must be valid (cid:27) /c = -  = m, where m is rest mass
of the atom.
The  following  investigates  whether  those  results  in  connection  with  relativistic  time
dilation allow any conclusion as to the very cause of time in the rest frame.

Clearly (2) coincides with (1) - apart from the constant (invariant) factor "c'dydz" in (1).
This implies relativistic mass and time to be equivalent and generated in the volume 
V' = dx'dy'dz' = dx'dydz by the movement of the latter at velocity v  in the (arbitrary) x-
direction of three-dimensional space - as has been shown before in [2]. 
On the other hand, according to the principle of relativity for any observer based at the
dashed system (considered moving), the rest mass of the H-atom and the quantum of
time would be m' = (cid:27)'/c = -'. Thus, as observed from the resting system, according to

This implies also rest mass and relativistic mass and, therewith, time in the rest frame
and  dilated  time,  respectively,  to  be  equivalent  that  means  of  like  origin.  In  other
words: analogously to the generation of relativistic mass and dilated time, rest mass
and time in the rest frame must be generated by the movement of a - for any observer
- hidden spatial dimension of the H-atom. This leaves the only conclusion that (cid:27)  is a
fourth geometrical dimension of the H-atom and physical time (quantum of time) in the
rest  frame  as  well  as  rest  mass  to  result  from  the  motion  of  (cid:27)   -  the  latter  being
orthogonal to three-dimensional space -  relative to a four-dimensional manifold.

Given  that  the  fundamental  length  in  R   is  (cid:27) ,  then  the  hypotenuse  of  the  smallest
possible Pythagorean triangle in the respective manifold is altogether the fundamental
length in the latter, namely

(cid:8)2 × (cid:27)  in R ,
(cid:8)3 × (cid:27)  in R ,

   2 × (cid:27)  in R .

In the previous work [2] for (cid:27)  the value (cid:27)  = mc = (cid:8)h has been derived, ignoring its
0
four-dimensional nature. But from the foregoing is clear that the fundamental length in
R  is 2(cid:27)  and that this fact has to be taken into consideration yet. Hence, it must be
valid

of the mean life-times of short-lived particle resonances and of the time quant given
there has to be corrected to

whereT¯  means life-time and (cid:10) full width. This implies that all life-times in units of the
time quant computed (in [2]) according to (6) must be doubled in accordance with (7).
Thus,  all  ratios  (6),  which  delivered  (nearly)  integers  plus  a  half,  become  -  after
doubling - integers now and the life-times of the top quark ((cid:10) (cid:17) 1.55 GeV) and of the
1370 MeV meson ((cid:10) (cid:17) 385 MeV) found at Brookhaven [3] are 2-  and 8-  (instead of -
and 4- ), respectively.

The result that all ratios (7) are (nearly) full integers strongly supports the conclusion as
to the fourth-dimensional nature of rest mass and time. If the theory is correct it follows,
time to be linked to matter, and to space only to the extent as the latter possesses
mass  or  energy,  furthermore,  that  no  particle  resonances  with  life-times  <  -   =1
1.357628 × 10  s in nature exist.

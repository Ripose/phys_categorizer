Abstract

This paper concerns the theoretical and experimental investigation of the magneto-impedance (MI) effect in
amorphous  wires  in  terms  of  the  surface  impedance  tensor  Vˆ.  Physical  concepts  of  MI  and  problems  of
significant practical importance are discussed using the results obtained. The theoretical analysis is based
on employing the asymptotic-series expansion method of solving the Maxwell equations for a ferromagnetic
wire with an ac permeability tensor of a general form associated with magnetisation rotation. The magnetic
structure-dependent impedance tensor  Vˆ is calculated for any frequency and external magnetic field, and is
not  restricted  to  the  case  when  only  strong  skin-effect  is  present.  This  approach  allows  us  to  develop  a
rigorous quantitative analysis of MI characteristics in wires, depending on the type of magnetic anisotropy,
the  magnitude  of  dc  bias  current,  and  an  excitation  method.  The  theoretical  model  has  been  tested  by
comparing the obtained results with experiment. For the sake of an adequate comparison, the full tensor  Vˆ
is  measured  in  CoFeSiB  and  CoSiB  amorphous  wires  having  a  circumferential  and  helical  anisotropy,
respectively, by determining the  21S
 parameter. In cases, when the rotational dynamics is responsible for
the impedance behaviour, there is a reasonable agreement between the experimental and theoretical results.
Such effects as the ac biased asymmetrical MI in wires with a circumferential anisotropy, the transformation
in  MI  behaviour  caused  by  a  dc  current  (from  that  having  a  symmetric  hysteresis  to  an  asymmetric
anhysteretic one) in wires with a helical anisotropy are discussed.

Introduction

This  paper  addresses 

the  magnetic-structure
dependent impedance analysis in amorphous magnetic
wires  with  a  helical  (or  circumferential)  anisotropy,
including such practically important phenomena as the
role of a magnetic anisotropy and a dc bias current in
controlling  magneto-impedance  (MI)  characteristics,
asymmetrical  MI  and  the  role  of  the  off-diagonal
impedance in asymmetrical MI. We have also carried
out an experimental investigation of these effects to be
able  to  demonstrate  the  consistency  between  the
theoretical  and  experimental  results.  Since 
the
discovery  of  the  MI  effect  in  1993,1  it  has  received
much  attention  due  to  its  importance  for  developing
new  generation  micro-magnetic  sensors  of  high
performance.1-4 However, most of the theoretical work
to  specific  conditions  not  always
is  restricted 
consistent  with  the  experiment.  In  certain  cases,
conflicting  experimental  results  on  MI  in  materials
with a similar magnetic structure have been reported.
This  has  occurred  when  different  types  of  excitation
have been used. This is particularly related to the case
of a complicated magnetic configuration, as the case of
a  helical  magnetisation  in  a  ferromagnetic  wire.
theoretical  and  experimental
Therefore,  rigorous 

research of MI effects accounting for specific magnetic
structures  and  excitation  methods  remains  to  be  of  a
considerable interest and importance.

In  general,  the  MI  effect  involves  a  very  large
and sensitive change in the voltage measured across a
ferromagnetic specimen with a well-defined transverse
magnetic  anisotropy,  carrying  a  high 
frequency
current  and  subjected  to  a  dc  magnetic  field.  For
example,  in  the  case  of  30  m m  diameter  amorphous
wires  of  a  composition  (Co0.94Fe0.06)72.5Si12.5B15
(having  a  circumferential  anisotropy),  the  voltage  (or
impedance) change can be as much as 10 to 50%/Oe at
frequencies of several megahertz.5-8 Considering MI as
a  change  in  a  complex  resistance,  it  has  a  direct
analogy  with  giant  magneto  resistance  (GMR).  In
earlier work there was an attempt to regard it as a new
ac  GMR  effect,  explained  in  terms  of  ac  quantum
magneto-transport.9,10  However,  this  approach  failed
to  explain  a  very  large  nominal  change  in  the
measured  voltage  as  a  change  in  true  resistance,  as
well  as  the  voltage  dependence  with  frequency  in  the
presence  of  a  dc  magnetic  field.  It  soon  became  clear
that  the  effect  has  an  electrodynamic  origin  owing  to
the  redistribution  of  the  ac  current  density  under  the
application  of  the  dc  magnetic  field.  In  the  original
theoretical work on MI 5,6 the current density has been

calculated  with  the  assumption  that  the  variable
magnetic  properties  can  be  described  in  terms  of  a
total  permeability  having  a  scalar  or  quasi-diagonal
form. This allows the impedance of a magnetic object
(and  the  voltage  induced  across  it  by  the  ac  current
) to be found essentially in the same
i
way  as  in  the  case  of  a  non-magnetic  material.11  In
this approach, the voltage response V  is of the form

therefore, 
the 
dependence of the transverse permeability controls the
voltage  behaviour.  This  simple  consideration  has
provided  a  qualitative  understanding  of  the  MI
behaviour, and in certain cases equations (1), (2) have
given  a  reasonable  agreement  with  the  experimental
results. A good example is the MI effect in a Co-based
amorphous wire. A tensile stress from quenching (and
enhanced  by  tension  annealing)  coupled  with  the
negative  magnetostriction  results  in  a  circumferential
anisotropy  and  a  corresponding  left  and  right  handed
alternative  circular  domain  structure.12,13  The  ac
current passing through the wire induces an easy-axis
magnetic field which moves the circular domain walls
so  that  they  nearly  cross  the  entire  wire.  The  circular
magnetisation  is  very  sensitive  to  the  axial  dc
magnetic  field  which  is  a  hard  axis  field.  The  ac

(2).  Substituting  in  equations  (1),(2)  this  circular
permeability  accounting  for  the  field-dependence  and
the frequency dispersion due to the local domain wall
damping  gives  a  very  good  agreement  with  the
experimental MI spectra for frequencies lower than the
characteristic frequency of the domain wall relaxation
  MHz  for  30  micron  diameter  wires).5,6
(~
Typically, the rotational relaxation is a faster process,
and  for  higher  frequencies  the  magnetisation  rotation
dynamics  dominates.  The  rotational  permeability  has
an  essential  tensor  form,  which  makes  it  difficult  to
use  equations  (1),  (2)  for  higher  frequencies:  the
difference  between  the  experimental  and  theoretical
results becomes quite considerable.

Further  experiments  on  MI  have  resulted  in

anisotropy,21  and  the  effect  of  an  ac  bias  field
producing  asymmetrical  voltage  response  in  systems
having  no  magnetic  asymmetry  in  the  dc  magnetic
configuration.22,23  Regarding  these  phenomena,  the
approach based on equations (1),(2) can fail to provide
even a qualitative explanation, especially in the case of
the ac biased asymmetrical MI.

Another theoretical difficulty is related to the
case of MI in the  multilayered films consisting of two
upper  magnetic  layers  sandwiching  a  non-magnetic
conductor.  If  the  film  width  is  smaller  than  a  certain
critical  value,  the  magnetic  flux  leakage  through  the
inner  conductor  becomes  essential  in  the  determining
the impedance tensor of the total system. This effect is
known  to  give  a  considerable  contribution  to  a  high
frequency inductance of similar systems. The existing
theoretical  approach  to  this  problem  24-27  does  not
account for the tensor form of the permeability, which
is  not  correct  for  a  practically  important  case  of  a
transverse (or crossed) magnetic structure in the outer
layers.28

Therefore,  numerous  experimental  results  on
MI require a more realistic theory taking into account
a  specific  tensor  form  of  the  ac  permeability  and
impedance. In the present paper, a general approach to
solving  electrodynamic  problems  for  ferromagnetic
objects characterised by a given permeability tensor is
proposed,  which  is  based  on  the  expansion  of
Maxwell’s  equations 
in  asymptotic  series.  The

in  such  fields  as  heat  transmission,  diffusion  and
certain problems in optics.29-31

The method of asymptotic series is applied to
the  calculation  of  the  surface  impedance  tensor  in  a
magnetic  wire  having  in  general  a  helical  magnetic
anisotropy.  The  ac  magnetisation  is  assumed  to  be
related to the rotational process and is described by a

The approach of the surface impedance tensor
(and  a  tensor  permeability)  to  described  the  MI
phenomena  has  been  previously  used  in  a  number  of
works  using  certain  simplifications.  In  the  case  of
magnetic/metallic  multilayers,28,32  the  edge  effects
have  been  ignored  completely,  and  the  film  system  is
treated  as  having  infinite  dimensions  in  plane.  The
asymptotic methods developed in the present work for
a  wire  geometry  can  be  modified  for  a 
two-
dimensional impedance analysis in the multilayer film
which will be published elsewhere. Regarding the wire
geometry,  in  Ref.  15  the  asymmetrical  MI  has  been

Voltage  response  and  surface  impedance
tensor

The GMI effect deals with a voltage response
in  a  thin  metallic  magnetic  material  subjected  to  a
high  frequency  excitation.  In  the  case  of  a  wire,  it  is
reasonable  to  use  an  ac  current  i  and/or  an  ac  axial
field  exh   as  a  source  of  excitation  (see  Fig.  2).  The
voltage is measured either across the wire ( wV ) or in
the  coil  ( cV )  mounted  on  it.  The  value  of  wV   is
determined by considering the energy consumption in

As it follows from (3), (4), the induced voltage can be

High frequency approximation

1<<

=
adb

The singular perturbation method constructed
with  respect  to  a  small  parameter 
  is
used  to  obtain  asymptotic  solutions  of  equations  (15)
in the case of high frequencies. Customarily,  this case
is treated by considering the plane geometry. However,
such  approach  allows  the  zero-order  terms  only  to  be
found.  For  the  purpose  to  build  a  general  asymptotic
solution  valid  in  a  wide  frequency  range,  the  higher-
order  terms  in  the  series  expansion  are  important  as
well.

.  Equations  (20)  have  a  small
parameter  at  the  second-order  derivative  and  are
related  to  so-called  singular  perturbed  equations.29-31
The solution of such an equation can be represented as
the  sum  of  two  (regular  and  singular)  asymptotic
series  of  powers  of  the  small  parameter.  The  regular
part  approximates  the  solution  within  a  certain
internal  area  whereas  the  singular  series  is  related  to
the  boundary  layer  (near 
)  where  the  solution
undergoes  rapid  changes.  Such  a  layer  is  named  as  a
frontier  layer.  In  our  case  it  corresponds  to  the  skin
, the singular part

The high-frequency limit equation (31) for the surface
impedance tensor (or its certain components) has been
obtained in a number of papers,15,32,33 regarding small
regions  at  the  wire  surface  as  flat  surfaces,  and
imposing  the  boundary  conditions  similar  to  (5).
However, 
to  a  zero-order
approximation  only.  The  higher-order  terms  can  be
important  to  determine  more  accurately  the  validity
conditions. For example, it has been considered that a
strong skin-effect approximation yielding (31) requires
/ <<ad
 which is much stronger than that involving
/ <<amd
the  magnetic  skin-depth 
.  This  opinion  is
based  on  the  field  distribution  as  in  Eq.  (30)
depending  on  the  both  decay  parameters.  For  an

amorphous wire (
non-magnetic skin depth becomes of the order of  a  at
GHz  frequencies.  On  the  other  hand,  numerous
experimental  results  on  MI  are  concerned  with
frequencies of 
 MHz, and it seems that the high
frequency  case  has  a  very  limited  use.  Within  the
proposed  method,  the  full  asymptotic  series  can  be
found.  Considering  the  first-order  approximation  is
important  in  context  to  prove  that  the  condition
/ <<amd

 is sufficient to justify the use of Eq. (31).

Our  approach  can  be  applied  to  a  wire  having  a
circumferential  or  helical  anisotropy.  In  general,  the
anisotropy axis  Kn  has an angle 
  with
the wire axis (z-axis), as shown in Fig. 1. The wire is
assumed to be in a single domain state with the static
magnetisation 
0M  directed in a helical way having an
angle  q  with the  z-axis. The radial variation in  q  is
neglected  as  explained  in  Section  III.  The  magnetic
configuration  changes  under  the  application  of  the
exH   and  the  dc  bias
external  axial  magnetic  field 
current  bI
bH .
The  stable  direction  of 
0M   is  found  by  minimising

 G). Then, the MI effects at frequencies
4
0
  MHz  are  not  related  to  the  ferromagnetic
of 
100
resonance.  This  statement  is  important  since  in  a
number  of  recent  works  34-36  MI  characteristics  are
explained  exclusively  as  a  consequence  of 
the
resonance  behaviour  of  the  permeability.  Yet,  a  high
sensitivity  of  c
exH   is  needed  to
obtain large impedance changes. This can be realised
by  changing  the  direction  of 
0M   under  the  effect  of
the  field.  As  follows  from  Fig.  3,  the  magnetisation
angle changes for fields of the order of the anisotropy
field 
KH ,  which  is  also  the  region  of  the  major
change  in  the  permeability  and  the  impedance.  For
higher fields,  c  changes little resulting in insensitive
impedance behaviour. Therefore, the overall reason of
the  MI  effects  is  the  redistribution  of  the  high-
frequency  current  density  when  the  static  magnetic
structure is changed.

Having 

specified 

static  magnetic
configuration  and  the  ac  permeability  tensor,  we  can
proceed with the impedance analysis, using equations
(44)- (46) for the low frequency case or equations

the  domain  structure  can  be  eliminated  by  a  dc

is
represented  by  the  ratio  of  the  forward  transmission

source is used as a sweep parameter. The signal from
the dc source is amplified with the dc power amplifier
that  supplies  power  to  the  coil  inducing  the  external

insensitive  area  is  determined  by  the  demagnetising
factor  since  the  sample  has  a  rather  small  length  (6

we  could  not  see  this  behaviour  considering  the  field

plots  of 
combined  effect  of  the  rotational  permeability  (which
has  a  maximum  at  zero  field  and  is  decreasing  with
the field) and the domain wall permeability (which has
a  minimum  at  zero  field  and  is  increasing  with  the

Conclusion

The  surface  impedance  tensor  approach  has
been used to study various types of MI characteristics
in  amorphous  wires  with  a  helical  (circumferential)
anisotropy.  Regarding  conceptual  aspects  of  the  MI
effect, it has been demonstrated that a high sensitivity
to the external field is caused by the dependence of the
current  density  distribution  on  the  static  magnetic
structure.  Therefore,  the  characteristic  field  of  the
major  impedance  change  is  the  anisotropy  field,  and
the  MI  spectra  are  very  broad  (from  a  few  MHz  to
hundreds  of  MHz  for  30  m m  diameter  Co-based
amorphous  wire).  Modifying  the  static  magnetic
structure,  various  types  of  the  MI  characteristics  can
be obtained: symmetrical or asymmetrical with respect
exH , without a hysteresis or exhibiting a hysteresis
to 
including of a bi-stable type. An interesting example is
the change in MI characteristics in wires with a helical
magnetic anisotropy under the effect of the dc current.
Considering a tensor nature of the impedance, the use
of the off-diagonal components results in asymmetrical
MI in the presence of the ac bias, which is especially
important for linear magnetic sensing.

The  theory  is  based  on  the  asymptotic-series
expansion  of  the  Maxwell  equations.  As  far  as  the
electrodynamic  problems  (such  as  the  impedance
analysis)  are  concerned,  this  method  has  been  used

important 

completely 

radial  distribution 

here for the first time. It yields the analytical solution
for  the  impedance  tensor  which  is  valid  in  entire
frequency and magnetic field range (1 MHz – 1  GHz)
of practical interest. The method has no restriction to a
specific  geometry.  It  can  be  expanded  to  consider
practically 
2-dimensional
magnetic/metallic multilayers. The major limitation of
the  theory  is  considering  a  uniform  magnetisation
ignoring 
of
a 
permeability  and  the  domain  structure.  Considering
MI  effects,  the  variation  in  permeability  may  not  be
important  since 
the  surface  magnetisation  gives
predominant  contribution.  Regarding  domain  wall
dynamics,  it  can  be  taken  into  account  by  modifying
the  permeability  tensor  on  the  basis  of  effective
medium  approximation  for  small  field  perturbations
(Ref. 5,42). By this, the eddy currents due to the local
wall displacements are averaged on the domain scale.
Another restriction is the ignoring of exchange effects.
This is accurate if the exchange length is smaller than
the skin-depth, which is typically valid for frequencies
under GHz-range.

The 

theoretical  model  has  been 

tested
comparing  the  results  with  the  experimental  data.  In
the  case  of  helical  anisotropy,  the  surface  impedance
tensor  has  been  measured  here  for  the  first  time.  The
theory  agrees  well  with  the  numerical  experimental
data as far as the ac rotational magnetisation processes
are responsible for the impedance change.

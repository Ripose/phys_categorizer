INTRODUCTION 

Melting  and  freezing  of  Coulomb  particles  is  common  phenomena  in  many 
astrophysical  objects  [1,2,3].  One-component  plasma  model  (OCP)  in  its  standard 
variant  with  rigid  compensating  background  (notified  below  as  OCP(#))  is  widely 
used for theoretical description of melting process of Coulomb (Wigner) crystal [4,5]. 
The  modified  OCP  on  uniform,  but  compressible  background  (notified  below  as 
OCP(~))  enriched  noticeably  combination  of  phase  transitions  in  the  model  due  to 
addition  of  1st-order  phase  transitions  of  gas-liquid  and  gas-solid  type  with  upper 
critical  point  [6].  Study  of  phase  transitions  in  OCP(~)  makes  it  possible  to  learn 
general  picture  of  thermodynamically  stable  and  metastable  melting  and  freezing  in 
wide  range  of  thermodynamic  parameters  including  in  particular  deeply  metastable 
coexistence  of  extended  crystal  with  overcooled  liquid  [7].  Recent  progress  in  the 
technique  of  dynamic  experiments  of  reaching  deep  negative  pressure  in  metastable 
extended  condensed  matter  in  crystal  and  fluid  states  [8]  raises  a  question  about 
behavior  of  metastable  melting  in  the  limit  of  zero  temperature.  Important  data  to 
analyze this problem can be obtained from a numerical simulation of phase transitions 
in  sufficiently  realistic  many-particles  systems.  Besides  the  analysis  of  the  problem 
could be supplemented the study of idealized modeling systems where the features of 
phase transitions can be calculated directly due to simplified modeling nature of these 
systems. Present paper is devoted to study of various scenarios of hypothetical closure 
of  zero-temperature  limit  melting.  The  analysis  is  based  on  the  features  of  idealized 
models. First of all it is the line of so-called “non-associative” coulomb models [6,7,9] 
the  number  of  modified  versions  of  well-known  prototype  –  one-component  plasma 
model with rigid uniform compressible background. 

“Conventional” Scenarios of Metastable Melting in Ordinary 
Substances in the Limit T => 0 

It is assumed according to this scenario (for example [10]) that metastable melting 
curve  reaches  the  matter  ‘cold  curve’  (isotherm  T = 0).  It  is  assumed  also  that  this 
hypothetical metastable branch of melting curve is in close agreement with so-called 
Simon’s law (1). Phase diagram with such behavior is shown on the Figure 1.

The same scenario is incorporated in construction of some semi-empirical equation 
of  state  (EOS)  of  metals  [11].  Hypothetical  multi-phase  density-pressure  diagram  of 
Al  exposed  at  Figure 2  as  an  example  of  such  EOS.  Fundamental  feature  of  this 
scenario  of  zero-temperature  metastable  melting  is  a  location  of  crystal-fluid  phase 
transition with a finite density gap just on the thermodynamically stable repulsive part 
of  “cold  curve”  i.e.  isotherm  T = 0.  Such  hypothetical  ‘cold  curve’  for  Al  [11]  is 
shown  on  Figure 3.  It  should  be  stressed  that  isotherm  T = 0  coincides  with  the 
isentrope  S = 0,  therefore  the  exposed  ‘cold’  melting  at  T = 0  [11]  occurs  without 
entropy change.  

Melting in Standard One Component Plasma Model OCP(#) 

Standard variant of one component plasma model on rigid background (following 
notation – OCP(#)) is a system of ions on rigid compensative background. It contains 
only  one  phase  transition  –  Wigner  crystallization,  which  takes  place  without  any 
density gap i.e. melting zone is just a one-dimensional curve. Melting line of crystal 
and freezing line of fluid coincides with each other. There are two well-known regime 
of melting in the model OCP(#):  
   1) Classical melting of non-degenerated ions in low density limit (θ ≡ kT/εF >> 1) In 
this  case  thermodynamic  properties  of  OCP(#)  depend  only  on  dimensionless  ‘non-
ideality’ parameter Г ≡ (4πn/3)⅓(Ze)2/kT. Melting corresponds to: Г = Гmelt ≈ 175 
   2)  “Cold”  quantum  melting  of  highly  degenerated  ions  in  high  density  limit  [13] 
(θ ≡ kT/εF >> 1).  In  this  case  thermodynamic  properties  of  OCP(#)  depend  on 
Bruckner 
to: 
rS ≈ const ≈ 100 [14,15].  
   General  diagram  of  melting  in  OCP(#)  is  shown  at  Figure  5.  It  should  be  stressed 
that melting in OCP(#) takes place at any temperature and formally follows Simon’s 
law (1) with (A = const., C= 4 and P*  0).

Scenarios of Metastable Melting in Modified OCP Model with 
Uniformly Compressible Background – OCP(~). 

More realistic than OCP(#) is a model of one-component plasma with uniform, but 
compressible  background.  This  property  of  the  background  can  be  defined  self-
consistently  [16]  and  can  be  achieved,  for  example,  with  the  use  of  uniform  ideal 
Fermi-gas  of  electrons  as  a  background  for  OCP  positive  ions.  Due  to  uniform 
compressibility of background not one, but three 1st-order phase transitions appears in 
this  model  namely  melting,  evaporation  and  sublimation  [6].  Melting  in  OCP(~) 
became  a  two-dimensional  zone  bounded  by  melting  and  freezing  lines  with  finite 

density  gap  (Figure  6).  Modified  OCP  model  (OCP(~))  introduces  principally  new 
behavior  of  melting  ‘strip’  in  the  limit  T → 0  i.e.  in  all  the  cases  (see  below)  the 
melting  zone  does  not  reach  the  T = 0  isotherm  (!).  As  a  result  the  ‘cold  curve’  in 
OCP(~) is smooth and continuous without any phase transition (Figure 4). As for the 
closure of metastable melting, there may be three variants of its termination in OCP(~) 
depending on charge number of ions, Z. All the variants occur at finite temperature. In 
first  two  variants  (A)  and  (B),  metastable  melting  terminates  at  the  liquid  or  crystal 
spinodals.  In  third  variant  (C)  melting  transmitted  continuously  into  sublimation,  so 
that there is no metastable melting at all.

The  advantage  of  the  OCP(~)  model  is  due  to  prohibition  (by  definition)  of  any 
individual  ion-electron  correlation  features  of  all  phase  transitions  including 
characteristic  of  metastable  branches  can  be  directly  calculated  if  properties  of  two 
individual subsystems namely ions with rigid background i.e. OCP(#) of ions and that 
of  ideal  Fermi-gas  of  electrons  are  known.  Currently  both  the  constituents  are  well 
studied  via  Monte  Carlo  and  Molecular  Dynamics  simulations  [5,14,15]  etc.  and 
effective analytical fits are exist, so that all the properties in ‘non-associative’ OCP(~) 
models could be calculated explicitly [6, 7, 9, 17].

Standard Scenario of Metastable Melting Termination in OCP(~) 

Along  with  conventional  scenario  of  metastable  melting  exposed  at  Figures  1-3 
there  is  a  fundamentally  different  ones  which  occur  in  the  OCP(~)  model.  The  first 
one (A) corresponds to the low values of ionic charge number Z << Z* ≈ 35 (see [18]) 
According to this variant in the limit of T → 0 the boundary of freezing of metastable 
liquid  touches  a  liquid  spinodal  at  finite  temperature.  While  the  melting  zone  is 
approaching  a  boundary  of  liquid  state  absolute  instability,  i.e.  liquid  spinodal,  its 
width  is  dramatically  increasing.  Figure  7  and  8  show  brief  and  close  view  of  this 
event  i.e.  crossing  the  freezing  curve  of  metastable  fluid  and  fluid  spinodal.  At  all 
temperatures  below 
is  absolutely 
thermodynamically  instable  and  doesn’t  exist  even  in  metastable  state.  Thus  the 
possibility  of  melting  as  physical  phenomenon  vanishes.  The  only  possibility  in  this 
case is spontaneous decomposition of metastable system to thermodynamically stable 
two-phase mixture of solid and vapour at finite temperature and pressure!

Anomalous Scenarios of Metastable Melting Termination in OCP(~) 

One  of  the  methodical  advantages  of  the  OCP(~)  model  is  additional  model 
parameter – charge of ions Z. While the ion charge is increasing the topology of phase 
diagram is dramatically changing. At the small value of Z the model shows traditional 
view  of  phase  diagram  (see  Figure  1  in  [18]).  But  as  the  ionic  charge  number  Z 
increases  the  melting  zone  moves  toward  the  critical  point  of  the  fluid-crystal  phase 
transition, passes it and finally shifts on the binodal of low-density phase. 

In  these  cases  there  are  additional  two  completely  new  scenarios  (B)  and  (C)  of 

metastable melting: 

Scenario B. At large values of charge number Z (Z >> Z** >> 45) the melting zone 
crosses a low-density slope of fluid-crystal co-existence curve (see Figure 1 in [18]). 
In this cases, as well as in the case (A) described above, the metastable melting zone 
also  doesn’t  reach  the  zero  isotherm  (T=0)  due  to  intersection  of  melting  line  of 
metastable crystal with vapor spinodal (line Г ≈ 6 at Figure 1 [18]). 

Scenario  C. This case corresponds to intermediate values of ionic charge number 
35 ≈ Z* > Z > Z**≈ 45  (see  [18]).  In  this  case  the  melting  line  Γ ≈ 175  of  model-
prototype  OCP(#)  falls  just  into  the  region  of  critical  point  of  new  1st  order  phase 
transition of gas-liquid type in OCP(~). The model shows an exotic ‘unified’ boundary 
of unique crystal-fluid phase coexistence, which is continuous superposition of normal 
melting  and  sublimation  equilibrium  (crystal-fluid  and  crystal-gas)  with  common 
boundary of crystal-fluid two-phase area when melting smoothly turns to sublimation 
(see Figure 4 in [18]). In context of presently discussing problem of possible variants 
of  metastable  melting  termination  it  means  that  the  metastable  melting  as  a 
phenomenon is absent in the system.  

CONCLUSIONS 

It  should  be  emphasized  that  all  the  details  of  discussed  above  hypothetical 
scenarios  of  termination  of  metastable  melting  in  the  limit  T → 0  could  be  directly 
examined in numerical Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations. The main 
problem,  which  should  be  overcome  on  this  way,  is  the  necessity  of  creating  and 
preserving  during  a  finite  period  of  time  a  deep  metastable  state  for  both  the 
competing phases, solid and liquid, with a deep negative pressure in the investigated 
simulation  cell.  Experience  currently  accumulated  in  such  numerical  simulation  of 
simultaneous two-phase coexistence (see for example [19]) allows for hope that quick 
progress in this problem will be achieved soon.

After describing all the contradictions associated with the current Plate Tectonics theory, 

this  paper  proposes  a  model  where  a  single  cause  can  explain  all  geophysical  and  geological 

phenomena. The source of the Earth's activity lies in the difference of the angular velocities of 

the mantle and of the solid inner core. The friction between both spheres infers heat, which is the 

cause of the melted iron which constitutes most of the liquid outer core, as well as the source of 

the global heat flow. The solid inner core angular velocity is supposed to remain steady, while 

the  mantle  angular  velocity  depends  on  gyroscopic  forces  (involving  acceleration)  and  slowing 

down due to external attractions and, principally the motions of mantle plates 2900 km thick. 

The  variations  of  the  geomagnetic  field  are  therefore  the  direct  consequence  of  the 

variations of the angular velocity of the mantle relative to that of the inner core. As a result, the 

biological  and  tectonic  evolutions  during  geological  times  are  due  to  those  phenomena.  So,  the 

limits of eras coincide exactly with the passage to zero of the geomagnetic field. 

Here we show that cycles of about 230-250 millions years, which exhibit the correlation 

between  the  mantle  angular  velocity  variations,  the  geomagnetic  variations,  and  therefore  the 

climate,  allow  us  to  predict  future  events :  the  current  global  warming  which  parallels  the 

Earth's magnetic field decrease, and the spoliation of the forests which are not damaged by acid 

rains, but in reality from their roots by acid liquid arising inside the cracks of the crust.

Finally, this geodynamics allows us to determine the mechanisms of earthquakes.

Since  the  discovery  of  the  mid-oceanic  ridges  in  the  1960's  the  continental  drift  model, 

proposed by Wegener in the 1930's and rejected at that time by the geoscientists, has been transformed 

into  "Global  Plate  Tectonics"  with  the  mechanical  support  of  convection  currents  inside  the  mantle. 

But the continuing impossibility of predicting earthquakes reveals an insufficient knowledge of Earth's 

geodynamics, which can be compared to the state of knowledge in medicine before Pasteur's discovery 

of  micro-organisms.  As  a  confirmation  of  this  comparison,  Plate  Tectonics  must  be  continuously 

modified in order to "explain" an earthquake occurring in an unexpected area (such as the last Kobe 

earthquake,  for  example).  This  reminds  one  of  the  medieval  period  when  the  anti-Copernic 

astronomers had to invent the concept of epiglyptical movements of the planets in order to adjust the 

observations to the geocentric model of the Universe.  

 

That is why it would be wise to consider inadequate the empirical approach to the lithospheric 

plates  defined  by  some  statistical  outlines  of  earthquake  epicentres.  Besides,  in  spite  of  the  public 

success  of  Plate  Tectonics  theory,  some  authors,  as  A.A.  Meyerhoff,  pointed  out  the  contradictions 

with  reality  and  proposed  a  new  global  geodynamics,  the  Surge  Tectonics  (see  Meyerhoff  et  al. 

(1996)), based on magmatic activity through the lithosphere, from the asthenosphere inside the upper 

mantle. Consequently, attempting to invent a possible mechanical model of the Earth's geodynamics, 

after  abstracting  from  observed  effects,  may  be  fruitful  if  the  consequences  of  this  model  fit  the 

observed  reality.  If  only  one  cause  can  explain  the  majority  of  the  observations,  which  this  paper 

intends to demonstrate, the probability that the theory is grounded in reality is great.

A.A.  Meyerhoff  located  the  "engine"  of  the  Earth's  dynamics  at  the  bottom  of  the  upper 

mantle. The model developed here "puts" it deeper, in the liquid outer core, which may be seen as a 

kind of magma. This model is based on the hypothesis of differences in the angular velocities of the 

solid inner core and of the mantle for mechanical reasons. This difference has already tentatively been 

put forward by several authors (Song and Richards, 1996 ; Su et al., 1996 ; Glatzmaier and Roberts, 

1996 ; Jeanloz and Romanowicz, 1997 ; Aurnou et al., 1998). We intend to demonstrate that, in fact, 

such  a  phenomenon  is  essential.  The  heat emitted by the resulting friction causes the melting of the 

outer  core,  geothermal  effect, and hot spots. The differences between the tangential velocities at the 

equator and at the poles of the surface of the inner core and of the periphery of the outer core infer a 

maximum friction at the equator tending to zero at the poles, and as a result producing a decreasing 

heat gradient. Consequently two electric fields originate for thermo electrical reasons from these two 

shells, which may be the source of the geomagnetism and explain its variations. However, magneto-

hydro dynamics effect could also be a source of the geomagnetism under specific conditions. 

The concept of lithospheric plates 100 km thick is replaced by mantle plates 2900 km thick. 

From the variations of the geomagnetic field due to the variations in the angular velocity of the mantle, 

we show the consequences on climate and species during the geological times. The main orogeneses 

and glaciations periods are connected to the Earth's magnetism and prove to be integrated in a regular 

time cycle. Moreover earthquakes are not only caused by a plate confrontation. 

We present a calculation related to the magnetic field of the model, which makes it plausible. 

Assuming steady the present decrease of the Earth's angular velocity, which we only attribute to the 

mantle,  we  calculate  the  probable  constant  inner  core  angular  velocity,  and  the  electric  charges 

responsible of the Earth's magnetism. 

Major problems of the current Plate Tectonics theory 

Following are the principle failings of the current Plate Tectonics theory. 

1)  The  basic  concept  which  supports  the  current  Plate  Tectonics  theory  is  the  assumption  of 

convection movements located inside the mantle and caused by the heat of the core. There is however 

 

4

a  contradiction  in  the  fact  that  the  mantle  lets  shear  waves  propagate  inside  it,  which  reveal  a 

crystalline structure inconsistent with the possibility of convection motions inside fluids. 

2)  The  oceanic  bottoms  are  flat  and  the  sediments  are  not  folded.  We  should  take  into  account  the 

pressure  and  constraints  that  the  up-lifting  and  superficial  parts  of  those  convection  currents  would 

apply on the thin lithospheric Plates which are 100 kilometres thick and several thousands kilometres 

long ; it is not conceivable that these plates can exist without being at least crumpled. 

3) The Benioff or "subduction" planes along which there would be the lithospheric slabs entering the 

mantle are said to be the location of earthquakes and active volcanoes : the evoked cause would be the 

mechanical  effect  and  the  heating  due  to  the  friction  created  by  the  downward  slab.  But  there  is 

inconsistency between mechanical ruptures (such as earthquakes) and melted rocks (such as magmas). 

Besides,  the  supposed  mantle  local  magmatic  zones  ought  to  be  cooled  down  by  the  cold  elements 

introduced  by  downward  slabs,  which  come  from  the  surface,  unless there are already melted zones 

extending  round  about  at  the  depth  of  100  kilometres.  But  it  is  unlikely,  otherwise  this  would  have 

been  revealed  by  the  lack  of  shear  waves  -  nevertheless  present  -,  as  in  the  case  of  the  fluid 

characteristics of the outer core. In addition, such a model does not explain the characteristic shape of 

island arcs. 

4)  The  geothermal  flux  is  reputed  to  be  same  all  over  the  globe,  and  to  be  the  consequence  of  the 

radioactive activity of the uranium present in crystalline rocks ; however, those rocks do not exist in 

the oceans (2/3 of the Earth's surface). 

5)  The  inner  core  is  solid  and  the  outer  core  liquid ;  as  both  parts  are  reputed  to  have  the  same 

composition, the opposite would be more logical given a central heat source. If the very high pressure 

was the cause of this state of fact, we could not have the existing sharp seismic interface between the 

outer and inner core. 

6)  One of the most upsetting enigmas is what occurs when the Earth's magnetic field is equal to zero, 

particularly in relation to the magnetosphere and the solar flux. One cannot be content with estimating 

this period too short to involve some consequences linked to the quantity of the solar flux hitting then 

the  Earth's  surface.  The  number  of  magnetic  inversions  should  be  examined  primaruly  from  the 

volcanic  samples,  and  not  from  the  oceanic  surface  "inversions",  the  origin  of which is not assured. 

 

 

 

 

5

The oceanic bottoms are indeed more complicated than the descriptions made in accordance with the 

"canons" of Plate tectonics. So, Cretaceous sediments (instead of Miocene or later) and even sericitic 

carbonaceous  phyllites  and  microquartzites,  as  well  as  carbonaceous  shales  were  dredged  in  the 

equatorial  segment  of  the  mid-Atlantic  ridge,  where  the  investigation  of  the  igneous  rocks  reveals  a 

continental  crustal  relict  of  pre-Cretaceous  or  pre-Jurassic  age  (Udintsev  et  al.,  1992 ;  Udintsev  and 

Kurentsova, 1993). Thus, it is difficult to attribute the variations of the oceanic magnetic field to the 

differences  in  the  paleomagnetic  directions  of  oceanic  bed  rock ;  they  are  more  probably  due  to  the 

contact between paramagnetic peridotites and magnetic serpentinites (altered peridotites). 

7) Finally, the cause of earthquakes occurring inside Plates which are supposedly impossible to distort 

should not be that of rubbing Plates. 

A new Geodynamic Model for the Earth 

Let us imagine the evolution of a very young spherical terrestrial planet of 6370 kilometres in 

radius, moved by its initial angular movement. 

• First step : The gravitational differentiation of its constituents causes the heaviest of them (density 

about 7 for example) to be moved and concentrated in the central area of the sphere. 

• Second step : There is a sharp gravitational separation between this heavy central area roughly 3500 

kilometres  in  radius  and  the  envelope  of  lower  density  (3.3  for  example).  The  external  attractions 

acting  on  the  Earth's  envelope  (the  moon  and  near  planets),  and  the  differences  in  the  respective 

kinetic energies and the centrifugal forces of both masses in rotation, involve contradictory constraints 

at  the  limit  between  them.  The  result  is  a  curbing  of  the  envelope  rotational  velocity,  and,  as  a 

consequence, a fragile zone arises at the interface. 

• Third step : This fragile interface breaks, which makes both parts independent from each other. Let 

us  call  them  the  core  inside  and  the  mantle outside. The angular velocity of the core is supposed to 

remain  constant,  as  well  as  its rotational axis which represents the inertial movement from the solar 

 

 

 

6

system  at  the  moment  of  its  creation.  Then,  the  mantle,  more  than  50 %  lighter  and  thinner  (2900 

kilometres compared to 3500) can slow down more easily than before. 

•  Fourth  step :  The  difference  in  the  angular  velocities  of  both  masses  involves  friction,  which 

increases the heat which reaches the lowest fusion point of both constituents. Therefore, if the core is 

made of iron and the mantle of aluminosilicates, the iron will tend to fuse first, because its fusion point 

is lower at equal pressure. We will then have an outer liquid core and an inner solid core. 

• Fifth step : This liquid helps to lubricate the zone located between the mantle and the solid core – 

which tends to externally melt more and more. The result is an acceleration of the difference between 

the  angular  velocity  of  the  mantle  and  that  of  the  solid  core.  Under  gyroscopic  forces  the  mantle 

rotates  faster  than  the  solid  core,  as  the  general  trend  of  the  air  masses  within  the  troposphere  is  a 

displacement  from  West  to  East  more  rapid  than  the  Earth's  rotation  which  is  responsible  for  this 

effect. But the Coriolis forces are different according to the latitudes, as well as the external attractions 

of  the  moon  and  near  planets.  Therefore,  the  mantle  undergoes  contradictory  forces,  which  leads  to 

cracks and breaks ; a few independent plates 2900 kilometres thick result, and begin to drift above the 

liquid core, essentially moved by the Coriolis forces. Between those plates, the liquid of the outer core 

takes advantage of the gaps in order to reach the surface, assimilating on the way the material of the 

mantle. 

• Sixth step : As the mantle plates float and move more and more rapidly, they absorb more and more 

energy,  the  result  of  which  is  the  slowness  of  the  angular  velocity  of  the  mantle,  which  becomes 

slower than that of the solid core. 

•  Seventh  step :  The  plates  begin  to  collide,  then  their  motions  are  stopped.  If  almost  all  the  plate 

motions are stopped, one of the brakes on the mantle rotation disappears, and then this rotation begins 

to accelerate again, until the motions of the new plates brake the mantle rotation. A new cycle begins. 

The  peripheral  melting  of  the  solid  core  must  modify  its  radius  in  proportion  of  the  friction 

heat quantity, that is to say of the differences in the angular velocities of the core and the mantle. Due 

to  energy  conservation,  the  solid  core  angular  velocity  should  vary  at  least  a  little  in  respect  to  its 

 

 

 

 

7

volume  since  its  density  remains  steady.  But,  in  this  paper,  this  phenomenon  will  not  be  taken  into 

account in order to avoid introducing too many unknown quantitative parameters. 

Possible internal consequences of such a model 

This model can involve some specific consequences in several fields of the Earth Sciences. 

•  Because  the  liquid  outer  core  is  the  seat  of  the  heat  source  generated  by  the  friction  between  the 

inner core and the mantle, the temperature should decrease towards the centre of the solid inner core, 

and more rapidly does towards the Earth's surface through the mantle. Thus it is logical that the inner 

core is solid and the outer core liquid. 

• The hot melted material of the outer core tends to rise between the edges of the new plates and then 

assimilates  on  the  way  some  mantle  material.  After  arriving  at  the  Earth's  surface,  this  magma 

accumulates  and  creates  mountains  -  such  as  oceanic  ridges  -  accompanied  by  their  corresponding 

rifts, which are the vertical channels of the up-going material. 

•  The  heat  flow  towards  the  surface  will  be  the  largest  above  the  up-going  magmas  and  steady 

between  them.  In  other  words,  the  geothermal  flow  must  be  globally  constant  and  the  same  above 

continents as well as above oceans. 

• The source of the Earth's magnetism and of the telluric currents may be then contemplated from the 

conductive  masses  in  movement.  The  friction  between  the  masses  of  different  angular  velocities  is 

maximum  at  the  equators  and  tends  to  zero  toward  the  poles  and  so  does  the  consecutive  heating. 

Thus,  thermo  electrical  gradients  arise  with  electrical  charges  at  the  surface  of  the  conductive  solid 

inner core and the periphery of the conductive liquid outer core. These two shells rotating at different 

velocities create the geomagnetic field, the variations of which depend on the difference between both 

velocities  (see  further  the  calculations  and  discussion).  As  it  is  assumed  that  the  inner  core  velocity 

remains probably steady in time, the variations of the mantle angular velocity are responsible of the 

geomagnetic  field  variations,  particularly  of  the  magnetic  reversals.  When  the  mantle  and  the  core 

rotate at the same velocity, the geomagnetic field is equal to zero. 

8

• The rotational axes of the inner core and of the mantle may be different. Particularly the one of the 

mantle may be variable ; this mantle, indeed, is more sensitive than the solid inner core to the various 

external  attractions  coming  from  the  Solar  system,  because  it  "floats"  above  a  liquid.  At  the  Earth's 

surface  an  apparent  polar  nutation  ensues,  and  the  geomagnetic  poles  may  wander,  reflecting  the 

instability of the electrically charged shell located at the basis of the mantle, probably the origin of the 

dipolar field (see further), the non dipole field being probably consecutive to the electrically charged 

shell located at the surface of the inner core. 

•  As  a  consequence  of  the  existence  of  a  magnetic  field,  electrical  (so-called  telluric)  currents 

propagate in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field and eastwards in the conductive areas of 

the  mantle  and  the  Crust,  particularly  inside  fluids.  There  must  be  a  radial  decrease  of  the  electric 

potentials towards the surface, which must cause an electric current when two conductive horizontal 

layers located at different levels are connected by a conductor. In this case, the spontaneous potential 

often observed along a slope can be easily explained, as well as in vertical boreholes. At the Earth's 

surface,  the  pointed  shapes  accumulate  electrical  charges  like  capacitors,  which  may  involve  sparks 

(so-called lightning) with aerial opposite charges. Theoretically, the vertical cliffs directed eastwards 

ought to accumulate electrical charges too, and it is easy to observe that large radio waves are more 

disturbed above the cliffs directed eastwards than above those directed towards other directions. 

• The plates as they have been defined above, that is to say 2900 km thick, may be fissured vertically. 

The  hot  liquid  material  of  the  outer  core  may  then  penetrate  into  the  mantle  basis,  and  continue  its 

penetration  up  to  the  Crust,  by  melting  and  assimilating  the  mantle  material  while  moving  forward, 

which  causes  some  areas  called  "hot  spots"  from  the  surface  (as  the  Yellowstone  geysers,  for 

example).  Various  kinds  of  chemical  composition  can  be  transported  by  gas  or  liquid  through  the 

cracks  and  fissures,  and  reach  the  continental  surface,  even  far  from  hot  spots  (see  the  case  of  the 

borehole  KTB  in  Bavaria,  for  example),  or  deep  oceanic  troughs  (as  in  Japan  for  example).  That  is 

why the phenomenon of "acid forests" may result, among other causes, from this kind of acid liquid 

oozing up to tree roots under the surface. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Relation of this model to the geological history of the Earth 

9

The  diagram  of  Fig. 1  shows  one  curve  which  represents  two  phenomena  as  a  function  of 

geological time between the hercynian orogenesis and the present time : 1) the mantle angular velocity 

variations, and 2) the magnitude and directions of the geomagnetic field. 

The  major  orogeneses  are  the  final  result  of  the  mantle  plates  defined  above  colliding  with 

themselves. Their horizontal motions are then stopped. When this occurs, the motions of these mantle 

plates  have  slowed  down  the  mantle  angular  velocity  which  has  become  slower  than  the  solid  core, 

and  has  consequently  caused  the  reversal  of  the  geomagnetic  field.  Afterwards,  as  soon  as  the 

orogenesis is "consolidated", after creating new plates which do not yet move at this time, the angular 

velocity  of  the  mantle  must  increase  rapidly,  and  become  faster  than  that  of  the  solid  core. 

Correlatively, the absolute value of the (reverse) geomagnetic field decreases down to zero when the 

angular  velocities  of  the  mantle  and  of  the  solid  core  are  almost  equal.  Afterwards  the  geomagnetic 

field increases northward until the mantle rotation is sufficiently slowed by the motions of the plates to 

begin  a  slow  deceleration.  The  corresponding  geomagnetic  field  then  decreases  and  reverses  after 

passing zero. Afterwards, the cycle begins again. 

When the geomagnetic field is large, there is a maximal deviation of the solar flux towards the 

poles  by  the  magnetosphere,  decreasing  the  heat  at  the  Earth's  surface.  This  involves global cooling 

and  large  glaciations,  which  occurred  in  the  early  quaternary.The  Triassic  glaciations  left  some 

indications such as tillites (at Granville in France, for example). 

As  for  the  periods  when  the  geomagnetic  field  is  very  weak  and  equal  to  zero,  we  have  the 

opposite situation : there is no more magnetosphere, and the solar flux directly reaches the surface of 

the  whole  globe.  As  a  consequence,  the  heat  increases  in  the  whole  atmosphere,  and  also  the 

ionosphere  (with  its  van  Allen  belts)  disappears ;  the  structure  of  the  atmosphere  at  these  times  is 

certainly different from that of today. The densities of the present troposphere and stratosphere were 

perhaps  smaller  than  today ;  in  this  case,  voluminous meteorites could more easily reach the Earth's 

surface. Therefore, it is easy to conceive that the changes in temperature and probably hygrometry at 

these  times  are  propitious  for  the  disappearance  of  species  and  genetic  mutations.  These  cases 

10

correspond, in fact, to each change of geological era : on one hand, the disappearance of the armoured 

fishes, Graptolites, Brachiopods, great Pteridophytas..., at the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic transition ; of the 

Dinosaurs,  Ammonoidea...,  at  the  Mesozoic-Kainozoic  transition ;  of  the  great  Mammalia  at  the 

Kainozoic-Quaternary  transition ;  and  on  the  other  hand,  the  appearance  of  new  phyla  such  as  the 

Reptiles  at  the  Palaeozoic-Mesozoic  transition,  the  Mammalia  and  Angiospermae  at  the  Mesozoic-

Kainozoic  transition,  the  Primates  at  the  Kainozoic-Quaternary  transition.  In  short,  the  era  limits, 

which were determined empirically, represent in fact the moments when the geomagnetic field passed 

zero. 

 

The increases and decreases in the mantle velocity may not be monotonous but jerky, which 

has  corresponding  repercussions  for  the  geomagnetic  field.  These  phenomena  are  particularly 

perceptible  in  two  cases :  1)  when  the  geomagnetic  field  is  near  zero,  2)  when  it is maximal. In the 

first case, the velocity jerks allow us to explain the numerous magnetic inversions occurring after the 

alpine  orogenesis,  and  also  in  the  Trias  after  the  hercynian  orogenesis,  while  the  Cretaceous  period 

shows a permanent direct field, and the Permian a long reversed field. The second case allows us to 

understand  why  there  were  several  periods  of  glacial  periods  with  interglacial  stages  in  the 

Quaternary : the mantle rotation velocity "hesitated" during about two million years before definitively 

decreasing. 

dating : 

 

The  mean  time  intervals  between  the  great  orogeneses  are,  in  the  present  state  of  absolute 

- 230 Millions Years (MY) between the alpine and hercynian orogeneses, 

- 220 MY between the hercynian  and caledonian orogeneses, 

- 100 MY (?) between the caledonian and cadomian orogeneses, 

- 400 MY between the cadomian and Grenvillian orogeneses. 

In fact, as the Grenvillian orogenesis is estimated at 1 000 MY BP, it is relevant to attribute a 

mean orogenic frequency of about 230-250 MY. This would be needed to attribute an age dating of 

750 MY to the cadomian orogenesis instead of the 600 generally attributed. 

 

 

 

Global geological consequences inside the mantle plates 

 

 

 

11

The plates defined in this paper, as they should have resulted from the last major orogenesis, 

that is to say, the alpine orogenesis, should be (partly) delimited by the oceanic and continental rifts. It 

is  not  our  aim  to  describe  all  of  them,  but  only  to  give  some  characteristic  examples.  We  discuss  a 

partition into plates which are much larger than the lithospheric plates in the literature ; for example, 

the  Eastern  Atlantic,  Africa,  Europe  and  the  western  part  of  Asia  would  represent  only  one  mantle 

plate. The Mediterranean region is only a relic of the Mesogea, the ophiolitic zones coming from the 

ancient rift which was the ancient limit between Eurasia and Africa before the alpine orogenesis ; but 

at present both continents are completely welded. However two individualised mantle plates may be 

welded  only  on  a  part  of  their  edges :  for  example,  the  Pacific  mantle  plate  is  probably  welded  in 

Siberia to the mantle plate described above and therefore without relative motion between them at this 

location. On the other hand, there may be friction between two mantle plates. The motions of them are 

- 

either  horizontal  such  as  between  the  Northern  Pacific  plate  and  the  plate  composed  of 

America  (North  and  South)  and  western  Atlantic,  in  the  North-West  along  the  San  Andreas 

Fault zone, 

surface. 

- 

or oblique on an inclined plane, such as the southern border of this last mantle plate with the 

south-eastern Pacific mantle plate, along the so-called Benioff plane at the West of Chile. 

In addition, such large plates may undergo inner modifications ; at least two of them are visible at the 

1) The author showed more than a decade ago that the confrontation of all the apparently contradictory 

geophysical data of the Mediterranean region could not be explained by a present plate facing, as is 

usually mentioned in the literature, but more probably by a present annular complex and a lopolith in 

the making (Rousseau, 1987 ; Rousseau, 1992). The model proposes magma rising inside a chimney 

of 1300 kilometres of radius centred below the Aegean sea, with a helical upward motion because of 

the  Coriolis  force.  After  penetrating  into  the  lithosphere,  the  magma  falls  into  the  upper  part  of  the 

central area of this chimney, crystallising because of the cooling, involving the collapsed structure of 

the  Aegean  region,  whereas  there  is  a  bumping  of  the  lithosphere  around  this  zone,  crossed  by  thin 

columns  of  magma  which  may  reach  the  surface  (volcanoes).  Inside  the  lithosphere,  this  bumping 

 

 

 

 

 

12

causes  tensions  and  constraints  producing  normal  and  reverse  faults,  and  observation  of  the  surface 

motions suggests a clockwise rotation in western Europe, which causes shear fractures. The origin of 

this rotation may come from the rotation of the "Aegean" magma, and perhaps also from a horizontal 

pressure exerted northward by Africa. 

2) The great fractures inside the mantle plates can be explained by the contradictory constraints they 

are undergoing, either on their edges by other plates, involving for example the so-called "transform 

faults" below the Atlantic Ocean, or in the neighbourhood of the great rising and rotating magmatic  

formations of the kind seen above, as in the case of the North Anatolian Fault, which does not have the 

same genesis as the San Andreas Fault. The North Anatolian Fault appears to be the consequence of 

the hindered rotation of western Europe against a stable block, the Russian platform (Rousseau, 1987 ; 

Rousseau, 1992). 

The morphological consequence of the model described above is an island arc. It is the case of 

the Aegean region. It is also probable that the Indonesian arc, the Japan arc, the Caribbean arcs, for 

example, can be explained by this kind of model, as well as atolls. 

Relations to earthquakes 

As earthquakes come from cracks inside solid rocks in the upper part of the Earth, we must 

examine  the  different  kinds  of  mass  motions  which  occur  inside  the  lithosphere  (crust  and  upper 

mantle)  and  under  this  lithosphere.  However,  observation  shows  that  there  is  not  necessarily  direct 

connection neither between earthquakes and displacements, nor pre-existing fractures. If we consider 

earthquakes as a simple result of a crack due to opposite constraints inside a solid, we must therefore 

examine the following cases. 

1)  If magma "lubricates" the relative motions of two mantle plates, as in the case of active rifts of 

the mid-Atlantic oceanic ridge, earthquakes will be rather occasional, even if their magnitude 

may  be  very  high.  On  the  other  hand,  if  rock  is  against  rock,  as  for  the  San  Andreas  Fault 

zone, the occurrence of earthquakes will depend on the shape of the reciprocal indentations or 

of the crenels relative to the plate motions, as is suggested in Fig. 2. The shear crack (mode II)

which permits the release of constraints accumulated by continuous relative displacement of 

the  plates,  may  occur  in  the  neighbourhood  of  their  edges,  if  there  is  a  weak  point.  For 

example,  the  half-dome  of  the  Yosemite  valley  in  California  is  perhaps  the  result  of  such  a 

phenomenon. We may also have the same causes of earthquakes in the case of the fractures 

occurring in the North-Anatolian Fault zone. 

2)  If magma pushes the lithosphere upwards, as is supposed for island arcs and atolls, the tensile 

forces  will  involve  cracks  of  mode  I  (so-called  extension)  and  of  mode  II  (so-called 

compressions) as a function of the kind of the deformation of the lithosphere (see Fig. 3 and 

Fig. 4 as the example of the Mediterranean region). 

3)  If torsion forces apply somewhere inside a mantle plate, because, for example, opposite forces 

exerted  from  outside  or  movements  are  thwarted,  one  or  several  shear  cracks  will  occur  in 

weak  points,  which  are  not  necessarily  pre-existing  fractures.  This  might  be  the  case  of 

Western Europe. However, if an area of large horizontal extension domain results from that, 

fractures  and  graben  may  occur,  as  the  Rhenan  trough  (France-Germany)  or  Death  Valley 

(California). 

Calculations and discussion 

We present some simple calculations of a possible geomagnetic field in connection with our 

geodynamical  model.  The  aim  is  to  show  that  this  model  is  viable,  and  that  the  results  are  realistic, 

even if they are not exactly right. 

The existence of differential axial rotation movements of conductive masses inside the Earth 

allows us to take into consideration two effects : the magneto-hydro-dynamical effect and the thermo 

electrical  effect.  In  order  that  the  first  be  a  possible  source  of  the  geomagnetism,  there  ought  to  be 

conductive veins within the mantle near its bottom which parallel the outer core. But for lack of more 

precise  knowledge  of  this  environment,  the  calculation  has  been  applied  to  the  model  based  on  the 

properties of thermo electricity, because we deal with the warm and conductive media of the inner and 

outer  cores.  The  friction  between  the  mantle  and  the  solid  core  rotating  at  different  velocities  is 

 

14

supposed  to  be  the  maximum  permanent  heat  source  inside  the  globe  and  is  therefore  located  in  the 

liquid outer core. 

In  principle,  we  can  consider  that  the  possible  differences  in  the  radial  temperatures  of  the 

outer core are not sufficient to cause thermo electric phenomena in this direction. But, the differences 

in the angular velocities of the mantle and the inner core mean that the differences in the linear (or 

tangential) velocities are not same from the equatorial zones to the polar zones of both spheres : they 

vary from their maximum at the equator to zero at the poles. Consequently the friction is maximum at 

the  equator  and  null  at  the  poles,  which  causes  an  increased  heating  from  the  poles  to  the  equator 

inside  the  whole  outer  core.  However  this  medium,  for  the  reason  it  is  liquid,  should be electrically 

neutral  because  the  positive  and  negative  ions  are  in  equal  number  and  mixed  by  the  rotational 

movement. Thus, it cannot be the source of any "self-induction dynamo". 

But,  owing  to  thermo  electrical  effects,  the  electrons  can  migrate  towards  the  poles  in  two 

precise locations : (i) inside the conductive medium of the surface of the inner core, which rotates at 

the inner core angular velocity, and (ii) inside the conductive medium of the periphery of the liquid 

outer  core,  which  is  "stuck"  to  the  bottom  of  the  mantle  and  rotates  at  its  velocity.  Note  that  these 

differences in heat distribution can explain the axi-symmetric anisotropy of the inner core described in 

the literature from seismic travel times (Shearer et al., 1988 ; Creager, 1992 ; Tromp, 1993 ; Song and 

Helmberger, 1995 ; Su and Dziewonski, 1995). 

 

As  long  as  the  angular  velocities  of  the  mantle  and  the  inner  core  are  different,  there  is  no 

tendency  to  heat  homogeneity  because  (i)  this  heat  device  is  open  towards  the  mantle,  and  (ii)  the 

inner core is not yet saturated by heat accumulation from the calculation of the thermal characteristic 

time of iron which yields a time superior to the Earth's age. As a result, there are two sources of the 

geomagnetic field, which can be assimilated to two electrically charged shells. This can be the cause 

of the existence of the "dipolar" and "non dipolar" fields. The rotational axes of the inner core and of 

the mantle do not mix, but they are close to each other, and we will consider they are the same for our 

calculations of geomagnetic field magnitude. However, if the rotational axis of the mantle were very 

different from that of the inner core, several dozens of degrees for example, we could have a magnetic 

field moving like a corkscrew, as Uranus has while rotating.

With µ0=4π10-7 Hm-1, the parameter ρij represents the mean values of the electric charges (in 

coulombs/m2) of the inner core (i=1) and of the outer core periphery (i=2) near the poles (j=1) and at 

the equator (j=2). Ω1 and Ω2 are respectively the angular velocities of the inner core and of the mantle, 

and θ and αi are centre angles to the northwards rotational axis ; αi separates the areas of positive and 

negative charges (see Fig. 5 where the charges are schematically represented for the present time) : i=1 

refers  to  the  inner  core  and  i=2  to  the  periphery  of  the  outer  core.  R1=1270*103  metres  (inner  core 

radius), R2=3470*103 metres (outer core radius), h=6370*103 metres (the Earth's radius). 

 

We  must  evaluate  Ω1  and  ρi1.  The  present  angular  velocity  of  the  mantle  Ω2  is  72.72*10-6 

radians/second. We suppose that Ω1 is constant with time and that Bz=0 when Ω1= Ω2. We can assess

this value of Ω2 from the present observation that day time increases by 0.0016 second per century. If 

we  put  this  effect  down  to  the  slowing  down  of  the  mantle,  in  conformity  with  our  theory,  we  can 

consider this phenomenon as identical to the one which ought to have occurred between 205 and 65 

Millions Years before Present (see Fig.1). That means that, in 140 Millions Years, there will be 2240 

seconds  (a  little  more than 37 minutes) which will have been added to the present 24 hours for one 

mantle rotation. The mantle angular velocity Ω2 will be then the same as that of the inner core angular 

velocity Ω1, that is to say 70.88*10-6 radians per second. 

 

As  for  the  values  of  ρij,  the  constraints  are  the  number  of  atoms  of  iron  (1.078*1022/g),  the 

presence of some per cents of nickel being not able to consistently modify this number. The maximum 

electrical  charges  for  Fe++  is  therefore  6.2  coulombs/m²  and  for  Fe+++  9.27  coulombs/m².  We  have 

chosen  the  intermediate  value  of  8  coulombs/m².  For  the  present  value  of  Bz=−0.5*10-4 Tesla  (see 

Lorrain  et  al.  (2000)  about  the  sign),  if  ρ11=−8 cb/m²  and  ρ21=+24 cb/m²,  α1=1 rad  (57.3°)  and 

α2=0.7 rad  (40.1°).  The  electrical  charges  are  negative  at  the  poles  of  the  inner  core  but  must  be 

positive at the poles of the outer core. The hypothesis is that the heat produced at the equatorial region 

by the friction of the inner core generates warm streams inside the liquid outer core, which reach the 

poles of the outer core because of convection and Coriolis forces, and are sufficient to reverse the heat 

gradients at the outer core periphery. The value of ρ21 is three times higher than the chosen electrical 

charges for Fe+++. There are probably several individualized conductive layers in the periphery of the 

outer  core.  Besides,  we  consider  that  ρ11  remains  steady  because  of  the  thermal  inertia  of  the  solid 

inner  core,  but  ρ21  must  vary  (linearly ?)  with  respect  to  the  absolute  difference  of  the  angular 

velocities of the mantle and inner core. Its value when Ω1= Ω2 would be 0.7 cb/m² with the same other 

parameters, which can be considered as a kind of thermo electric remanence. 

The warm streams are possible because the mantle rotates faster than the inner core ; they are 

probably disturbed and blocked up when the mantle rotates less rapidly than the inner core. Thus the 

heat gradients are decreasing from the equators to the poles for both the inner core and the periphery 

of the outer core, ρ11 and ρ21 are then both negative, which involves a reversed geomagnetic field. 

This effect occurs because |Bz1| is fairly small and the sign of Bz is rapidly given by Bz2 as 

Bz2  is  increasing.  For  example,  for  the  current  value  of  Bz,  |Bz2|  is  worth  35  times  |Bz1|.  As  a 

 

 

 

 

 

17

consequence, the dipolar field must be connected to Bz2 (at the periphery of the outer core) and the 

rapid fluctuations of the geomagnetic field probably reflect a strong instability in time at the boundary 

between mantle plates and liquid outer core. 

This model can explain the numerous magnetic reversals in the early quaternary, at a moment 

when Bz was close to zero and Ω2≈Ω1 (see Fig. 1), by the instability of the warm streams originated at 

the equator of the inner core, and which could reach the periphery of the outer core (then Bz < 0), or 

could  not  do  it  because  of  insufficient  heat  (then  Bz > 0).  Besides,  Bz2  is  very  sensitive  to  the 

parameter  α2,  that  is  to  say  to  the  surface  of  the  periphery  of  the  outer  core  reached  by  the  warm 

streams. So, from the current values, Bz would decrease by 1/10 if α2 increased of 0.14 radian (8°), 

that is to say following a small extension of the warm polar area of the periphery of the outer core. 

Even  if  these  streams  are  well  stabilized,  some  weak  variations  of  α2  can  still  involve  the  observed 

present  rapid  variations of the geomagnetic field magnitudes. As a consequence of the link between 

the mean temperatures inside the troposphere and the geomagnetic field magnitudes, some fairly weak 

disturbances in the warm streams inside the outer core (causing variations of α2) occurring at the time 

of high absolute value of the geomagnetic field magnitudes, as should have been the case one million 

years  ago,  must  have  caused  noteworthy  variations  of  Bz.  Consequently  the  well  known  glacial-

interglacial stage alternations occurred at this time. 

Conclusion 

The source of the Earth's activity lies in the difference of the angular velocities of the mantle 

and of the solid inner core. The friction between both spheres generates heat, which is the cause of the 

melted iron constituting mainly the liquid outer core, as well as the source of the global heat flow. The 

solid  inner  core  angular  velocity  is  supposed  to  remain  steady,  while  the  mantle  angular  velocity 

depends  on  gyroscopic  forces  (involving  acceleration)  and  slowing  down  due  to  external  attractions 

and mainly to the motions of mantle plates 2900 km thick. 

 

The difference of tangential velocity between the equator and the poles at the friction locations 

creates differences of heat , which are the source of thermo electric effects inside conductive elements.

So the geomagnetic model of two electrically charged shells, located on the surface of the solid inner 

core and at the periphery of the liquid outer core permits us to represent the geomagnetic field, with its 

dipole and non dipole components, as well as its past variations, including the reverse field. 

The variations of the geomagnetic field are therefore direct consequence of the variations of 

the  angular  velocity  of  the  mantle  relative  to  that  of  the  inner  core.  In  one  word,  the  biological  and 

tectonic  evolutions  during  the  geological  times  are  due  to  those  phenomena.  So,  the  limits  of  eras 

coincide exactly with the passage to zero of the geomagnetic field. 

This  model  has  three  advantages :  (1)  it  fits  correctly  with  all  the  known  geophysical  and 

geological  elements,  eliminating  the  contradictory  explanations  such  as  the  convection  currents  in 

solid  materials  or  the  homogenous  heat  flow  all  over  the  Globe  from  the  radioactivity  inside 

continental  rocks,  (2)  it  is  simple  and  logical  from  a  physical  point  of  view,  and  (3)  it  purchases  a 

simple and obvious explanation of the geomagnetic field. 

 

The  cycles  of  about  230-250  million  years,  which  show  the  correlation  between  the  mantle 

angular velocity variations, the geomagnetic variations, and therefore the climate, allow us to predict 

future  events.  Therefore,  the  global  warming  observed  since  the  beginning  of  the  last  century 

(involving glacier melting, for example), is parallel to the Earth's magnetic field decrease, and is going 

to  continue.  Stopping  atmospheric  pollution  is  necessary,  but  that  will  unfortunately  not  stop  this 

warming which we will have to adapt to. It is the same for the forests which are reputed to be damaged 

by  acid  rains,  but  which  may  be  spoiled  in  reality  from  their  roots  by  acid  liquid  arising  inside  the 

Last  but  not  least,  this  model  should  enable  us  to  examine  the  mechanisms  which  trigger 

earthquakes  from  a  stress  anisotropy  point  of  view.  Earthquake  prediction  could then be made from 

continuous  concrete  determinations  in  the  field  of  the  stress  anisotropy,  knowing  the  thresholds  of 

cracks of the crust. 

rupture. 

As  an  extension  to  the  understanding  of  other  planets  of  the  solar  system,  the  presence  or 

absence  of  magnetic  field,  as  well  as  of  heat  source,  can  be  investigated  on  the  ground  of  the 

probability  of  the  disjunction  between  the  angular  velocity  of  their  core  and  of  their  envelope.  For 

example,  the  magnetic  field  of  Uranus,  which  is  tilted  about  60  degrees  with  respect  to  the  rotation 

19

axis, and as a result, moves like a corkscrew as Uranus rotates, may be the result of two electrically 

charged shells, the one "stuck" to the envelope rotating around its axis lying 8 degrees out of the plane 

of the orbit, the other "stuck" to the core rotating around an axis probably closer to the perpendicular 

of the plane of orbit.

Abstract. 
 
     Attention  is  drawn  to  problems  associated  with  superstatistics,  including  the 
apparent  lack  of  knowledge  of  previous  work  in  statistical  physics  displayed  by 
workers in this supposedly new field. 
 
     

      The apparent lack of communication between workers in statistical mechanics and 
information theory is both surprising and disturbing. It has led over recent years to the 
pouring of old wine into new bottles with labelling that makes the uninitiated believe 
that  ideas  taken  from  information  theory  and  presented  in  statistical  mechanics  are 
new.  No  better  example  is  afforded  than  that  of  the  so-called  ‘Tsallis  entropy’[1], 
which is actually a result in information theory produced by the Hungarian school in 
the late 1960’s and well documented in the book by Aczél and Daróczy [2]. As far as 
this  example  is  concerned,  the  only  difference,  and  that  a  very  slight  one,  is  in  the 
choice of normalising factor. However, in some ways even more surprising, is the use 
of  some  known  formulae  of  statistical  mechanics  in  statistical  mechanics  itself  with 
no  reference  to  the  original  work.  Even  if  used  for  supposedly  different  purposes, 
citing original references is the accepted norm. 
 
      Superstatistics [3] purports to provide a description of fluctuations in the inverse 
to  Beck  and 
temperature 
collaborators, a system at thermal equilibrium (i.e. distributed canonically) would be 
described by the usual Boltzmann factor, e-b E, where E is the energy of the system and 
b  the characteristic reservoir parameter, the inverse temperature of the heat bath with 
which  the  system  is  in  thermal  contact.  However,  in  ‘driven,  non-equilibrium 
systems’, one can rightly  expect  fluctuations  in b ,  and  consequently  the  system  will 
be characterised by an ‘effective Boltzmann factor’ given by the Laplace transform 

in  ‘driven,  non-equilibrium  systems’.  According

of a normalised probability density, f(b ), which describes fluctuations in the inverse 
temperature.  Further,  in  the  discussions  of  superstatistics,  a  distinction  is  drawn 
between  ‘type-A’  and  ‘type-B’  superstatistics  [4].  This  distinction  is,  in  fact, 
something  of  a  red  herring  since  it  converts  the  inverse  density  of  states  (which  is 
really  what  B(E)  is)  into  a  normalised  probability  density  function  (pdf),  p(E),  by 
incorporating the normalising factor Z(b ) into the definition of the pdf f(b ) so that it 
becomes 
 The  problem  here  is  that  neither  Beck  nor  his 
collaborators was first to conceive of fluctuations in inverse temperature but they do 
not  reference  any  earlier  work  on  this.  When  it  is  realised  that  b   is  an  estimable 
parameter - that is, one to be estimated in terms of measurements made on the energy 
of  the  system  -  then  it  becomes  apparent  that  any  estimator,  b (E),  of  the  inverse 
temperature, which must be a function of the energy, must fluctuate itself [5]. 
 
      If  E denotes the mean sample energy, Beck’s formula (1) in the latest publication 
on superstatistics [6] is none other than equation (4.102) of Lavenda’s 1991 book [5],

Lavenda  identified  L(b ) as  the  logarithm  of  the  moment  generating  function  for  the 
central  moments  of  the  energy.  In  a  completely  symmetrical  picture,  S(E)  is  the 
logarithm of the moment generating function of moments in the inverse temperature. 
Lavenda  terms  this  the  ‘dual’  representation  [5,  p.208]  made  possible  by  Bayes’ 
theorem  of  inverse  probability.  The  distinction  made  was  that,  whereas  E  may  be 
interpreted as a random variable in the limit-of-frequency sense, b  must be interpreted

-
in  the  sense  of  degree-of-belief  that  certain  values  of  b   are  more  likely  than  others. 
These ideas actually go back to Szilard [7] and Mandelbrot [8], as is documented in 
Lavenda’s monograph [5]. 
 
Further, Lavenda emphasises the fact that, in the thermodynamic limit as Boltzmann’s 
constant  tends  to  zero,  Laplace’s  method  of  evaluating  (1)  assumes  the  main 
contribution  to  come  from  a  neighbourhood  of  b E,  in  Beck’s  notation,  which  is  the 
only minimum of   

b E  +  L(b ). 
This  effectively  reduces  the  Laplace  transform,  (1),  to  the  Legendre  transform  [5, 
eq.(4.84)]

which he attributes to Wilk and Wlodarczyk [9] and himself [10], may, once again, be 
found in Lavenda’s 1991 monograph [5, eq. (4.97)]. All that is necessary to make the 
comparison is the simple change of notation n = 3N and 
 
     Other criticisms of actual superstatistics may  be found in various references [11] 
but  the  main  point  being  raised  here  is  the  need  for  people  to  be  aware  of,  and 
reference, results already in existence in their field.

Abstract

Time  resolved  transient  absorption  spectroscopy  has  been  used  to  determine

quantum yields for electron photodetachment in 193 nm and (where possible) 248 nm

laser excitation of miscellaneous aqueous anions, including hexacyanoferrate(II), sulfate,
halide  anions  (Cl-,  Br-,  and  I-),  pseudohalide  anions  (OH-,  HS-,  CNS-),  and  several

common inorganic anions for which no quantum yields have been reported heretofore:
-. Molar extinction coefficients for these anions and

photoproducts of electron detachment from these anions at the excitation wavelengths

were also determined. These results are discussed in the context of recent ultrafast kinetic

studies and compared with the previous data obtained by product analyses. We suggest

using  electron  photodetachment  from  the  aqueous  halide  and  pseudohalide  anions  as

actinometric standard for time-resolved studies of aqueous photosystems in the UV.

1. Introduction.

Photoinduced  electron  detachment  from  aqueous  anions,  such  as  halides  and

pseudohalides,  is  a  rapid,  efficient  charge  transfer  reaction  in  which  the  solvent  itself

serves as an acceptor of the ejected electron (charge transfer to the solvent, CTTS). [1,2]

For  any  photoreaction,  the  quantum  yield  (QY)  is  one  of  the  most  important

photophysical parameter, and electron detachment from the anions is no exception to this

rule. While many estimates for the quantum yields of hydrated electron generated in the

course  of  CTTS  photoreactions  have  been  given  in  the  literature  (section  1.1),  these

estimates agree poorly with each other and strongly depend on the actinometric standards

used.  Furthermore,  recent  kinetic  data  (discussed  below)  [3-14]  suggest  that  the  very

approach used to obtain these quantum yields 20-40 years ago, by product analysis, was

inherently inconsistent (as was realized by several authors in the 1960s [15,16]). On the

other hand, accurate QY measurements are necessary for understanding the photophysics

of charge separation on short time scales [4]. In this work, we report quantum yields and

cross  sections  for  fifteen  aqueous  anions  photoexcited  at  193  and  248  nm.  Due  to

unexpectedly complex photophysics and chemistry, these measurements turned out to be

rather involved. This article deals mainly with these QY measurements per se and various

complications encountered along the way. A meaningful interpretation of these QY data

is  possible  only  when  these  QY  data  on  the  free  electron  yield  are  combined  with

ultrafast  kinetic  measurements  (as  done  in  ref. [4]  for  iodide);  this  task  is  deferred  to

another publication (Part III of this series [17]).

1.1. Background and Motivation.

In polar liquids, including aqueous solutions, some anions (X-) exhibit absorption

bands (CTTS bands) that are lacking in their gas phase spectra. Photoexcitation of these

anions in their CTTS bands causes rapid (< 150 fs [5]), efficient (with the prompt QY

approaching  unity [4])  detachment  of  the  electron  from  the  photoexcited  anion  to  the

solvent. Solvated electrons generated in this reaction are observed on the time scale of
10-11  to  10- 5   s  [3-7,12-14].  Because  of  the  fundamental  importance  and  perceived

simplicity  of  this  CTTS  photoreaction,  much  effort  has  been  devoted  to  studying  the

2

photophysics of electron detachment from halide anions. In particular, there have been

several ultrafast studies in which the electron dynamics were studied on pico- [3-7] and

femto-  [5]  second  time  scales.  These  studies  were  complemented  by  state-of-the-art

molecular dynamics [18,19,20] and ab initio calculations [2] that shed light on the nature

of the short-lived CTTS state and mechanistic aspects of the charge separation. Several

other  aqueous  anions  have  been  studied  in  addition  to  iodide,  most  significantly,

ferrocyanide  (hexacyanoferrate(II))  [13,14],  which  is  a  common  source  of  hydrated

electrons in photochemical studies. Interestingly, this polyvalent anion exhibited electron

dynamics  that  were  entirely  different  from  those  observed  from  the  halide  and

pseudohalide anions.

For  the  majority  of  aqueous  anions,  fast  kinetic  studies  of  one-photon  CTTS

reactions were slow to come, because no convenient source of pulsed excitation in the

UV (where these anions have their CTTS bands) was available. Recently, we used short

200 nm pulses (300 fs fwhm) to study the electron dynamics for several aqueous anions,
[12,17,21]  including  halides  (I-  and  Br-),  pseudohalides  (HO-,  HS-,  and  CNS- ),  and
2-). These 200 nm studies, and complementary 250-220 nm

divalent anions (SO3

2-, CO3

studies  carried  out  by  Bradforth  and  coworkers  [3-7]  indicate  the  complexity  of

photoexcitation  process  in  the  CTTS  systems.  From  these  studies  it  appears  that  two

different mechanisms operating in tandem are responsible for the electron detachment

from the aqueous anions:

The  first  mechanism  involves  the  dissociation  of  a  short-lived  CTTS  state  and

results in a narrow distribution of the electrons around the parent species (X• radical or

atom).  Both  the  kinetic  studies  [4,12,17]  and  molecular  dynamics  simulations  [20]

suggest  the  existence  of  a  short-scale,  attractive  mean  force  potential  between  these

electrons and the residual species (at least, for halides and pseudohalides). The resulting

kinetics exhibit a fast (10-50 ps) exponential component due to the recombination and

escape of the electrons residing near the bottom of the mean force potential well. These
fast kinetics are succeeded by a long-term t-1/2 decay on subnanosecond (and longer) time

scales;  [4,12,22]  this  decay  is  due  to  diffusional  migration  and  recombination  of  the

electrons that are thermally emitted from the potential well to the solvent bulk.

3

The second mechanism by which the hydrated electrons are generated is direct

ionization  of  the  anion  by  the  UV  photons.  This  competing  process  results  in  the

formation  of  a  mobile  conduction  band  electron.  This  energetic  electron  localizes  and

thermalizes  far  from  the  parent  species  (>  1  nm),  and  the  resulting  geminate  decay

kinetics are purely diffusional. According to our studies [17] and work by Bradforth and

coworkers  [13,14],  polyvalent  anions  yield  this  type  of  kinetics  exclusively.  Some

polyatomic monovalent anions (e.g., thiocyanate) also seem to yield these kinetics only,

even  at  low  photoexcitation  energy  [17].  For  other  monovalent  anions,  the  direct

ionization may or may not occur, depending on the excitation energy [10,11,17]. E.g., for

iodide, photoexcitation using light with wavelength > 220 nm yields decay kinetics that

are  independent  of  the  excitation  wavelength;  however,  200  nm  kinetics  are  very

different  from  these  220-250  nm  kinetics.  [11,17]  In  particular,  the  200  nm  kinetics

exhibit  higher  escape  yield  of  the  electron  and  demonstrate  other  features  that  are

consistent with broadening of the electron distribution around the iodine atom [17]. Using

2-photon  excitation,  Bradforth  and  coworkers  [11]  irradiated  aqueous  iodide  at

progressively higher energy and found that the escape yield systematically increased with

the total excitation energy. These observations suggest a competition between the direct

ionization  and  the  CTTS  process.  Such  a  competition  has  been  invoked  previously  to

account  for  the  observed  increase  in  the  quantum  yield  for  electron  detachment  with

increase in photoexcitation energy (e.g. refs. [23] and [24]).

Most of the photophysical studies on anion CTTS were carried out in the 1960s,

before the complexity of the electron dynamics was recognized. With few exceptions, the
approach was to convert electrons to N2 using 10  mM N2O as a scavenger

and  measure  the  evolution  of  gaseous  N2.  High  concentration  of  the  scavenger  was

needed to prevent the loss of photogenerated electrons to recombination [15,16].  As  a

result,  some  of  the  electrons  were  scavenged  geminately,  and  this  was  recognized  by

Airey and Dainton (in their studies of ferrocyanide) [15] and Jortner et al. (in their studies

of  iodide)  [23].  Picosecond  kinetic  studies  justify  the  concerns  of  these  authors  since

4

retrospective  analysis  of  their  data  reveals  many  inconsistencies  originating  in  the

complexity of the electron dynamics [4]. While short-term exponential kinetics are too

rapid to compete with the relatively slow reaction (1) [4,12], long-term kinetics unfolding

after this fast exponential decay are sufficiently slow, and some geminate electrons are

scavenged by N2O. Thus, a QY for N2 evolution via reaction (1) provides an upper limit

estimate  for  the  QY  of  free  electron  formation.  Since  the  relative  weight  of  the  fast

(exponential) and slow (power law) kinetics varies for different photosystems (e.g., refs.

[4], [13], and [17]) and depends on the relative efficiency of direct ionization and CTTS

excitation  for  a  given  photon  energy,  [10,11,17] even qualitative comparison between

different photosystems is questionable.

Airey  and  Dainton  [15]  pointed  out  to  another  consequence  of  the  geminate

scavenging in N2O-saturated aqueous solutions: In reaction (1), (geminate) electron is

converted to a (geminate) hydroxyl radical. This radical rapidly reacts with the residual

species X•, changing the product distribution. E.g., geminate OH radical can react with

the  cyanide  ligand  of  ferricyanide  that  is  formed  in  electron  photodetachment  from

aqueous 

ferrocyanide; 

the 

resulting  CN 

radical  converts 

ferricyanide

(hexacyanoferrate(III)) back to ferrocyanide [15]. Consequently, the QY of the electron

estimated from the ferricyanide yield is always underestimated. This conclusion pertains

to other measurements in which the QY for the electron was estimated from the yield of a
- in the photoexcitation of iodide [26] and

stable photoproduct derived from X• (e.g., I3

ferricyanide in the photoexcitation of ferrocyanide [27]).

For higher excitation energies (180-200 nm), an additional source of uncertainty
2-, Cl-,
is actinometry. Dainton and Fowles [28,29] based their measurements for OH-, SO4
and Br- [29] on the quantum yield of H2 (0.3) in 185 nm photolysis of 0.01 M aqueous

methanol (which, in turn, was estimated from the QYs of 0.3 and 0.46 for neat water and

methanol, respectively, and the assumed QY of unity for photodissociation of aqueous

N2O), [28] whereas Jortner et al. assumed a QY of 0.65 for the same photosystem [30].

Such  a  discrepancy  exists  for  other  "standard"  actinometers  for  the  UV.  E.g.,  the

estimates for the QY of H2 generation in the ethanol-water actinometer at 185 nm range

from 0.4 to 0.8 [31].

5

It is apparent from the above that for the QY measurement to be reliable, (i) the

electron  yield  should  be  determined  directly,  on  a  fast  time  scale,  and  (ii)  precision

photometry rather than actinometry should be used to determine the fluence of the UV

photons. To our knowledge, only one previous study met these requirements. Iwata et al.

[24]  used  pulsed  UV  light  from  an  excimer  laser  and  measured  the  absorbance  of

hydrated electron at 720 nm, ca. 50 ns after the end of the laser pulse. Photooxidation of
2-, Cl-, and Br-, the
water by Eu3+ was used for actinometry at 193 nm [32]. For OH-, SO4

193 nm measurement gave QYs that were not too far from the 185 nm yields obtained by
Dainton and Fowles; [29] however, for I-, it gave a QY that was quite different from that

obtained by Jortner et al. [30]

In this work, we improve on these time-resolved measurements and extend the

method  to  less  common  CTTS  (and  suspected  CTTS)  anions  (such  as  carbonate,

bicarbonate, nitrate, nitrite, chlorate, and perchlorate). We also give one-photon quantum

yields for ionization of neat water by 193 nm light and dissociation of aqueous hydrogen

peroxide  by  248  nm  light.  In  the  course  of  this  study,  we  realized  that  the  QY  data

obtained by Iwata et al.  [24] were compromised due to the absorption of the laser light

by photoproducts generated within the duration of the laser pulse; our analysis includes

corrections  for  this  complicating  effect.  The  correction  is  largest  for  anions  that  are
2-  at  248  nm;

efficient electron donors but absorb the excitation light poorly (e.g., SO3

Table 2) and anions that yield products that strongly absorb at the excitation wavelength

(e.g., ferricyanide at 193 nm; Table 2). The absorptivity of these photoproducts can be

estimated from the power dependence of the laser light transmittance, and we give such

estimates  for  several  species,  including  hydrated  iodine  atoms.  Other  complications

included  secondary  chemistry,  reactions  of  electrons  with  impurity  (e.g.,  for
-), protic
2-), ion pairing (for ferrocyanide), and the dependence of the

hydrosulfide), competition between mono- and bi- photonic excitation (for ClO4
equilibria (for HS- and CO3

QYs on the ionic strength of (concentrated) solutions. Since many of these anions exhibit

one peculiarity or another, they are dealt with on a case to case basis (section 4). This

survey is preceded by the analysis of pertinent photophysics given in section 3. To save

space, some figures (Figs. 1S to 12S) are given in the Supporting Information.

2. Experimental.

The setup. Unlike Iwata et al., [24,32] who used 3 cm optical path cell and 90o detection

at the cell midsection (where laser light was attenuated by the sample), a short optical
path (L=1.36 mm) cell and 30o detection were used in this work, i.e., all the electrons

generated  along  the  path  of  the  excitation  light  were  probed  with  the  analyzing  light.

Another  difference  is  our  use  of  photometry  instead  of  actinometry  and  direct

measurement of the absorbed and transmitted laser power. These modifications allowed

us  to  deal  with  the  complications  introduced  by  the  absorption  of  the  laser  light  by

photoreaction products.

Fifteen nanosecond fwhm, 1-20 mJ pulses from an ArF (193 nm) or KrF (248 nm)

excimer laser (Lamda Physik LPX 120i) were used to photolyze N2-saturated aqueous

solutions of the anions. The optical path cell had detachable 1 mm thick suprasil windows

sealed  to  the  stainless  steel  body  of  the  cell  with  parafilm  gaskets.  Following  the

suggestion of Iwata et al., [24] we used CaF2 windows in some of the initial experiments;

however, this material was found to be unsuitable due to rapid generation of color centers

by  193  nm  laser  light  and  corrosion  of  these  windows  by  photoexcited  ions  (such  as

sodium thiocyanate). The refractive index for Suprasil is 1.508 at 248 nm and 1.56 at 193

nm,  [33] and the calculated reflectivity of the window is 0.048 and 0.04, respectively.

Typical  transmittance  of  these  windows  at  193  nm  was  90.6  to  91.5%.  The  reflection

losses at the glass-window boundary were factored into the QY calculation; the reflection

losses at the glass-water boundary were ignored due to the similarity of the refraction

indexes for the two media (for water, the refraction index is 1.4 at 193 nm and 1.35 at

248 nm, [34] so the reflection losses are < 0.1%).

The laser beam was focused by a 50 cm focal length, 3 mm thick CaF2 lens and
uniformly illuminated a rectangular 3 mm x 6 mm, 130 µm thick brass aperture placed

onto the front window. This laser beam was normal to the window. The beam energy was

attenuated using a set of fine wire mesh filters placed 1.5 m away from the focussing lens

(the pattern cast by these filters was destroyed by diffraction). The analyzing light from a

superpulsed 75 W Xe lamp was passed through 4 cm of water (to reduce heat transfer to

7

the sample), a color glass filter (> 500 nm), and crossed at 30o with the excitation beam.

After traversing the sample, the analyzing light passed through another color glass filter

and was focussed on the detector using a 7 cm focal length achromat. The wavelength of

the  analyzing  light  (typically,  700  nm)  was  selected  using  a  10  nm  fwhm  band

interference  filter.  With  our  beam  and  cell  geometry,  ca.  18%  of  the  cell  volume

illuminated by the laser light was not probed by the analyzing light, and the effective

mean  path  for  the  analyzing  light  was  1.29  mm.  A  correction  was  made  to  take  this

shadowing into the account for the QY calculations.

A fast silicon photodiode (EG&G model FND100Q, biased at -90 V) with a 1.2

GHz video amplifier (Comlinear model CLC449) terminated into a digital signal analyzer

(Tektronix model DSA601) were used to sample the transient absorbance kinetics (3 ns

response  time).  Two  calibrated,  NIST  traceable,  lithium  tantalite  pyroelectric  energy

meters  (Molectron  model  J25-080  with  black  oxide  coating  that  provides  flat  spectral

response in the UV) were used to measure the power of the incident and transmitted UV

light. To this end, a small fraction of the excitation light was diverted to one of the meters

using a thin suprasil beam splitter before the sample cell; the second meter was placed ca.

50 cm behind the cell (where the beam is sufficiently expanded). The output signals from
these energy meters were amplified using Gentec PRJ-D meters, terminated into 1 MΩ

and sampled at 200 kHz using a 12-bit ADC board (National Instruments PCI-6064E). 8-

to-10 of these digitized waveforms were averaged and the peak signals were converted to

the laser energy using calibration values provided by the manufacturer. A series of 6-10

such measurements were collected and the energies given by the two detectors linearly

correlated,  in  order  to  determine  relative  transmission  of  the  laser  light  through  the

sample  (this  averaging  and  analysis  was  performed  during  kinetic  sampling).  Typical

standard errors of the laser power and transmission measurements were 1-3% and 0.1-

0.7%, respectively. Two power measurements, one for the cell filled with pure water and

one  for  the  aqueous  solution  being  studied,  were  taken  for  each  laser  power.  The

difference between the measurements of transmitted energies (corrected by the window

reflectivity) gave the number of absorbed photons, whereas their ratio (corrected by the

ratio of incident laser energies) gave the transmission coefficient. To assess the reliability

of  the  absolute  power  measurements,  the  readings  from  J25-080  pyroelectric  detector

8

were compared with the readings from a thermopile detector (Gentec ED500 with EM-1

meter). These two detectors were calibrated at 248 and 1064 nm, respectively. When the

latter is corrected by 6% to take into account the reflectivity of the coating at 248 nm, the

two readings were within 2% of each other.

Materials and the flow system. 0.2-0.5 L of aqueous solution of the salts was circulated

through  the  cell  using  a  peristaltic  pump.  The  typical  flow  rate  was  2-3  ml/min;  the

repetition rate of the laser was 1.7 Hz. ASTM Type I purified water (with conductivity <

2 nS/cm) was used to prepare all of the aqueous solutions. The quality of water used to

rinse the flow system was constantly monitored conductometrically (YSI model 35) and

the  optical  cell  was  filled  with  a  new  sample  only  when  the  conductivity  of  the  rinse
water decreased to < 1 µS/cm. The UV spectra of the aqueous solutions were obtained

using a generic spectrophotometer (OLIS/Cary 14).

Reagents of the highest purity available from Aldrich were used without further

purification. For several reagents, purity was of special concern. Most brands of sodium

chloride contain bromide and iodide impurity, and ultrapure 99.999% reagent was used.

Sodium  sulfite is  oxidized  by  dissolved  oxygen in  water  and the solutions were made

using deaerated water and used immediately thereafter. Ferrocyanide typically contains

ferricyanide impurity and its aqueous solutions are not photostable; ultrapure 99.99+%

reagent was used under anaerobic conditions and the solutions were stored in the dark.

Sodium  hydrosulfide  was  available  as  a  hydrate  only  (25  wt%  of  water  was  assumed

from the specifications provided by the manufacturer) and contained traces of colloidal
sulfur  [35]  that  reacted  with  the  electron  (k=2x109  s- 1  for  1  M  HS-).  Potassium

thiocyanate  (99.9+%)  contained  unidentified  impurity  that  slowly  reacted  with  the
electron (k=4x107 s-1 for 1 M of CNS-). Hydrogen peroxide (1 M standard) was stabilized

by traces of tin; no absorbance from the stabilizer was apparent in the UV spectra. High-

purity  0.989  N  analytical  standard  KOH  was  used;  the  hydrosulfide  and  hydroxide

solutions were purged by dry nitrogen and handled in a nitrogen box.

Methodology. The typical QY measurement included determination of four parameters:

laser transmission T  through  the  sample,  the  decadic  transient  absorbance  (which  was

9

determined at the end of the laser pulse)  ∆ODλ of the photoproduct at wavelength λ  of

the analyzing light, the laser energy Iabs  absorbed by the sample, and the incident beam

energy  I0.  Several  aqueous  solutions  of  the  salt  were  prepared  so  that  the  laser

transmission  through  the  sample  varied  between  0.1  and  0.8.  Typical  kinetics  for

hydrated electron are shown in Figs. 5 and 3S(a). For each of these solutions, the four
parameters were determined and then  ∆ODλ was plotted as a function of Iabs (e.g., Figs.

1(a) and 3(a)) and T was plotted as a function of I0 (e.g., Fig. 3(b)) For all systems studied

in  this  work,  the  latter  plots  were  linear,  and  the  molar  extinction  coefficients  for  the

anion and the "photoproduct" (hydrated electron and residue X•) can be obtained from
these plots using eq. (12) derived in section 3. If the plots of  ∆ODλ vs. Iabs were linear (or

had a linear initial section), the initial slope of this dependence was determined by a least

squares linear regression and QY calculated using eq. (11). This QY was then corrected

for the window transparency and noncolinear beam geometry (see above). Some of the
plots of  ∆ODλ vs. Iabs were very curved (e.g., Fig. 3(a)), even at low laser power. These

dependencies were fit using an empirical formula

where coefficients A  and  B were determined by least squares optimization. The initial

slope was then estimated from the product AB. The use of eq. (2) is justified in section 3.
If not stated otherwise, absorption of hydrated electron at 700 nm (ε700=20560  M-1 s-1

[36]) at the end of the UV pulse (at 30 ns) was used to obtain the electron yield. The

anion  concentration  and  light  fluence  were  chosen  so  that  the  decay  half  time  of  this
electron (due to cross recombination) was longer than 1 µs (for most photosystems, this
time was 5-10 µs).

3. Quantum yield measurements: analysis.

In this section, we derive basic equations needed for the QY determination. Let us

introduce x, the penetration depth of the excitation light, L, the sample thickness, J(x,t),

the  laser  radiance  across  the  unit  area  of  the  sample  at  the  delay  time  t  (we  assume

uniform surface illumination), J0(t),  the  radiance  of  the  light  incident  at  the  sample  at

the product. We will assume that (i) the absorption of the laser light by the photoproduct

does  not  change  the  concentrations  of  this  photoproduct  and  the  substrate  and  (ii)  the

photoreactions are complete on a time scale that is much shorter than the duration of the

laser pulse. With these assumptions, the absorption of the laser light obeys the following

system of partial differential equations

(Eq. (12) has been generalized for  β

more) absorptive and this makes the sample more (or less) transparent to the laser light.

4. Results.

This section is organized as follows: First, QY measurements for pure water at

193 nm and hydrogen peroxide at 248 nm are discussed. One-photon ionization of water

at  193  nm  is  facile  [24,37]  and  its  efficiency  needs  to  be  known  to  study  electron

detachment  from  anions  that  are  poor  absorbers  of  193  nm  light  (e.g.,  chloride  and

perchlorate). Photodissociation of H2O2 by 248 nm light is a benchmark system to test the

accuracy of our QY measurement (de facto providing an actinometric standard) as there

have been very reliable QY measurements made by product analysis for this photosystem

at  254  nm [38]. Second, we survey those photosystems for which the routine analysis

outlined in sections 2 and 3 was insufficient. Third, the data on the anion absorptivities

are  summarized  and  compared  with  the  previous  spectrophotometric  data.  Fourth,  the

discerned "photoproduct" absorptivities estimated by use of eq. (12) are compared with

the transient absorption data, where such data exist.

induced by a 72 mJ/cm2 pulse was ca. 1.75x10-3, and the QY was (1.40±0.04)x10-2. A
QY  of  (1.27±0.17)x10-2  for  hydrated  electrons  was  obtained  using  a  d.  c.

to yield carbonate radicals that absorb strongly at 600 nm (ε600=1860 M-1 cm-1 [41]). We

photolysed 24.3 mM and 41.3 mM solutions of H2O2 in the presence of 1 M KHCO3 (pH

8.33). Typical kinetics of 600 nm absorbance are shown in Fig. 1S(a). The highest yield
of the hydroxyl radicals estimated from our data was 300 µM (Fig. 2S(a)). As explained

elsewhere [42], side reactions of hydroxyl radicals (e.g., with peroxide itself [43]) and

cross  recombination  were  too  slow  to  compete  with  rxn.  (19)  (carbonate  radical  was
formed in 200 ns); the decay of the carbonate radicals was also too slow (5-15 µs)  to

deplete the concentration of these radicals at t=200 ns (Fig. 1S(a)). The plot of the optical

density at 600 nm vs. absorbed laser power was slightly curved (Fig. 1(a)) and the plot of
the  transmission  vs.  the  incident  laser  power  exhibited  a  negative  ∂ ∂T Q   slope  (Fig.

2S(b)). A quantum yield of 0.443±0.01 for decomposition of H2O2 was obtained from the

initial  slope  of  the  dependence  shown  in  Fig.  1(b)  and  a  molar  extinction  coefficient
ε248 of 24.8±0.4 M-1 cm-1 was obtained at 248 nm. Our spectrophotometric measurement
gave ε248=26 M-1 cm-1 vs. the reported 25 M-1 cm-1 [44] (the absorbance of 248 nm light
by bicarbonate was negligible, ca. 0.0206 M-1 cm-1). Our quantum yield compares well

with the primary yield obtained by product analyses: 0.49±0.07 [38] and 0.47±0.03 [45]

at  254  nm  and  0.45±0.06  at  222  nm  [46]. Note that the accuracy of our measurement

depends on the accuracy of the extinction coefficient for the carbonate radical, which is

±10% [41].

15

The negative curvature of the  ∆OD600   plot  in  Fig. 1(a) is accounted for by the

absorption of 248 nm light by hydroxyl radicals generated by the laser pulse (as shown

elsewhere, these radicals escape from the solvent cage in ca. 30 ps [42]). Czapski and
Bielski gave an estimate of ε248(OH)=500 M-1 cm-1 [47]. Thus, under the conditions of

our experiment, up to 20-40% of the 248 nm photons were absorbed by these radicals

(Fig. 2S(a), traces (i) and (ii)). Using our estimate for the molar absorptivity of peroxide
and eq. (12), ε248 of 508 M-1 cm-1 was obtained for the hydroxyl radicals from the data of
-  radicals  that

Fig. 2S(b)  (this  estimate  neglects  the  conversion  of  OH  radicals  to  CO3

occurred during the 248 nm pulse, which was less than 10%). Using this estimate and

solving eq. (13) numerically, we were able to simulate the power dependence shown in

Fig.  1(a)  (see  Fig.  1S(b)).  The  estimates  for  the  QY  and  the  molar  absorptivity  of

hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals obtained by our method agree very well with

the estimates obtained by completely different techniques.

4.2. Special cases.

Most  of  anion  photosystems  presented  below  were  much  like  the  benchmark
system  examined  in  the  previous  section:  the  ∆OD700   plots  of  hydrated  electron

absorbance were linear or nearly linear with the absorbed laser power, the extrapolated

absorbance at Q=0 scaled with the anion concentration, etc. Some of the representative

plots for these "perfect" systems are given in the Supporting Information (Figs. 3S to 7S)

and the data are summarized in Tables 1 to 3; these results deserve little comment. Other

systems exhibited more unusual features, and only those will be discussed below.

4.2.1. Carbonate (193 nm photoexcitation).

The peculiarity of the carbonate photosystem is the protic equilibria that involve
the carbonate anion. The pKa values for H2CO3 are 6.35 and 10.33 (at 25oC), [48] and

even dilute solutions of carbonate can be very basic. Let c be the molar concentration of

the salt, K2 be the second ionization constant, and Kw be the ionic product for water. For

the relative hydroxide concentration decreases with the carbonate concentration. Using

16

accurate formulas, one can estimate that for 1.5 and 5.7 mM carbonate solutions (Fig.
8S), the equilibrium concentrations of OH- and CO3
2- anions are 0.47 mM and 1.02 mM,

respectively, and 1 mM and 4.7 mM, respectively. Since at 193 nm hydroxide has 20.6

times  higher  molar  absorptivity  than  carbonate  (as  shown  below),  the  presence  of

hydroxide  in  the  solution  has  significant  implications.  In  particular,  the  often  cited
estimate for molar absorptivity by the carbonate at 193 nm, ca. 630 M-1 cm-1 (which can

be traced back to the 1932 work by Ley and Arends [49]) is incorrect, as it does not take

hydroxide into account. As demonstrated below, when the absorption of the UV light by

the hydroxide is taken into account, carbonate and bicarbonate have very similar molar

absorptivities at 193 nm.

The starting point of this analysis is the determination of φ and ε193 for hydroxide

and bicarbonate at 193 nm. For the latter anion, the protic equilibria are inconsequential
since  the  equilibrium  concentration  of  hydroxide  is  maintained  at  ca.  2  µM  due  to
buffering (Fig. 9S). Both of these anions give linear ∆OD700 and OD193  plots (Fig. 5S)

and the corresponding data are given in Table 1. Fig. 2 demonstrates the concentration

dependence for the QY and 193 nm absorptivity for the carbonate system. Both of these

quantities  systematically  increase  with  the  carbonate  concentration.  Since  the  QY  for

electron  detachment  from  bicarbonate  is  very  low  (0.07)  this  photoreaction  may  be

neglected, and the dependencies shown in Fig. 2 were interpreted in terms of competing
2- and HO-:

The  equilibrium  concentrations  of  hydroxide  and  carbonate  were  estimated  from  the

known  ionization  constants  for  carbonic  acid, [48]  so  that  only  two  parameters  were

unknown  (the  QY  and  molar  absorptivity  for  the  carbonate  anion).  Those  were
determined from the least squares fit to eqs. (20) which gave  ε
2−  of 150±20 M-1 cm-1

(vs. 134±2 M-1 cm-1 for bicarbonate) and a quantum yield  φ

2− of 0.453 (vs. 0.112 for

CO3

CO3

hydroxide).  Note  that  in  the  above  analysis  we  neglected  the  absorbance  of  carbonate

radical  that  is  formed  in  the  course  of  the  electron  detachment.  The  latter  has  molar
absorptivity of 685 M-1 cm-1 at 700 nm which is ca. 3% of that of the electron.

17

While hydrosulfide anion, HS-, is also a strong base (H2S has pKa's of 7.05 and
19),  [48]  the  protic  equilibria  are  unimportant  since  the  deprotonation  of  HS-  is

negligible. Even at the lowest hydrosulfide concentration used in this study (0.23 mM)

nm  is  1.7  higher  than  that  for  the  hydroxide,  the  contribution  of  the  hydroxide  to

4.2.2. Ferrocyanide (248 nm and 193 nm photoexcitation)

At 193 nm, ferrocyanide exhibits a combination of a near unity quantum yield for

electron photodetachment, (Tables  1  and  4)  high  molar  absorptivity  of  the  photolyzed

anion  [14,23,50] and even higher molar absorptivity for one of the photoproducts (the
reported ε193  for  ferricyanide  is  16300  M-1 cm-1 [50]).  As  a  consequence,  the  plots  of
∆OD700 vs. Iabs are strongly curved (Fig. 3(a)) and photoconversion is extremely efficient

(Fig. 10S). The standard procedure used to extract the molar absorptivities using eq. (12)
gave  7560±40  M-1  cm-1  for  ferrocyanide  (Table  2)  and  14300±200  M-1  cm-1  for  the

photoproduct (Table 3); see Figs. 3(b) and 4(b). Since the molar absorptivity of hydrated
electron  at  193  nm  is  ca.  2300  M-1  cm-1,  the  molar  absorptivity  for  ferricyanide  is
estimated at 12000 M-1 cm-1 which is considerably lower than 16300 M-1 cm-1 determined

spectrophotometrically [50].  Furthermore,  our  estimate  for  ferrocyanide  is  also  lower
than  the  previously  published  values:  9170  M-1  cm-1 [14,23]  and  8400  M-1  cm-1 [50].
Another  peculiarity  is  that  ∆OD700  vs.  Iabs  plots  obtained  at  different  concentrations

poorly match though all of these plots exhibit very similar initial slopes (Fig. 3(a), trace

(i)).  Numerical  solution  of  eq.  (13)  using  the  obtained  photophysical  parameters

reproduces  the  curvature  of  these  plots  but  gives  much  less  variation  with  the

ferrocyanide concentration (Fig. 11S(a)).

The  probable  cause  of  these  discrepancies  is  the  considerable  ion  pairing  that

occurs in the ferrocyanide system [13,51,52]. In the explored concentration range (< 0.7

mM) only single-cation association is important. Conductivity measurements of Davies
[52] suggest an association constant of 176 M-1, while the optical measurements of Cohen
and Plane [51] suggest a somewhat lower value, 104±8 M-1. Using the former value, we

estimate  that  30%  of  the  anions  are  paired  with  a  potassium  cation  in  a  0.65  mM

18

ferrocyanide solution. The KFe(CN)6

3- anion is known to be a poorer absorber of the UV
4- [51]. A closer examination of Fig. 4(a) shows that absorption of the

light than Fe(CN)6

ferrocyanide solution at 193 nm is not exactly proportional to the concentration: there is a

slight positive curvature. The latter can be explained assuming the coexistence of free and

associated anions that have slightly different molar absorptivities. Using the association
constant given by Davies [52], we estimate that free ferrocyanide has ε193 of 7900±140
M-1 cm-1 whereas the associated anion has 17% lower absorptivity, 6580±400 M-1 cm-1.

Progressive  decrease  in  the  absorptivity  with  the  ferrocyanide  concentration  would
account for the concentration dependence of the ∆OD700 vs. Iabs plots in Fig. 3(a).

At 248 nm, ferricyanide is a much poorer light absorber than ferrocyanide (865
vs. 4730 M-1 cm-1; Table 2) and the absorption of laser light causes photobleaching of the

solution (Fig. 12S(a)). Both the QY and molar absorptivity of ferrocyanide at 248 nm are

significantly lower than these quantities at 193 nm, and the behavior of this anion at 248
nm is much less extreme. Though the plot of ∆OD700 vs. Iabs is curved, a single curve can

be  drawn  through  the  data  obtained  for  different  ferrocyanide  concentrations  (Fig.

12S(c)).  Spectrophotometric  measurements  suggest  that  the  molar  absorptivity  of
4-, [51] i.e., the ion

3- anion at 280 nm is just 2% lower than that of the Fe(CN)6

KFe(CN)6

pairing appears to be inconsequential for 248 nm photoexcitation. The estimated molar
absorptivity of ferrocyanide at 248 nm, ca. 4300 M-1 cm-1, is close to values given in the
literature  (4480  M-1  cm- 1 [23],  4730  M-1  cm- 1 [50]).  Our  estimate  for  the  “product”
absorbance is 690±120 M-1 cm-1 obtained using eq. (12) is probably too low (the hydrated
electron itself absorbs 248 nm light with molar extinction coefficient of 600 M-1 cm-1

[44]).

4.2.3. Iodide: secondary chemistry.

In the preceding analysis, it was implied that only hydrated electron absorbs 700

nm analyzing light. For all halides and pseudohalides, with exception of hydroxide, the

(the  hydroxide  undergoes  a  reversible  deprotonation  with  the  formation  of  O- instead,
with rate constant of (1.2-1.3)x1010 M-1 s-1; see ref. [12]  for more detail). Most of the
-
- anions absorb in the near-UV and visible (see, for example, ref. [56] for Cl2
-, the
and ref. [59] for H2S2
molar  absorptivity  at  700  nm  is  very  low,  ca.  380  M-1  cm-1  (2%  of  the  electron

[53,54,55,61] According to the survey by Elliot and Sopchyshyn, [61] estimates for the
molar absorptivity at the band maximum range from 2120 to 4000 M-1 cm-1, with 2560
M-1 cm-1 as the preferred value (which comprises 12.5% of the electron absorbance at
700  nm  [36]).  For  iodine  atoms,  reaction  (21)  is  rapid  (k21=(0.88-1.2)x1010 M-1  s-1

4.2.4. Perchlorate: the ionic strength effect.

Perchlorate has very little absorbance at 193 nm, and to observe a signal, very

concentrated (2-9 M) solutions were used (Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)). As shown in Part II of

this series, [21] for all anions, the addition of (chemically inert) salts, such as Na2SO4 and

NaClO4, causes a large decrease in the QY for electron photodetachment, ca. 6-10% per 1

M of ionic strength, and this pertains to the sulfate and perchlorate anions themselves.
While sulfate is a relatively strong absorber at 193 nm (46±7 M-1 cm-1, Table 1), so that

the  QY  can  be  determined  in  dilute  solutions  (4-20  mM)  for  which  the  ionic  strength

effect is minor, the extrapolated molar absorptivity for perchlorate (see below) is very
low,  ca.  0.57  M-1  cm-1,  and  the  use  of  concentrated  solutions  is  unavoidable.  In  such

solutions, two other effects occur: the CTTS absorption band shifts to the blue [1] and the

absorption band of the hydrated electron itself shifts to the blue (resulting in a 20% loss

of 700 nm absorbance in 9 M NaClO4 solution [21,63]). Due to the anion band shift, the
-] is nonlinear (Fig. 6(b)), and the molar absorptivity given above

plot of OD193 vs. [ClO4

was obtained from a polynomial fit to this plot and its extrapolation to zero concentration
of the perchlorate. The plots of ∆OD700 vs. Iabs exhibit a negative curvature, suggesting a

competition between one- and two-photon excitation (Fig. 6(a)). The plots were fit using
the formula  ∆OD

perchlorate  concentration  with  a  slope  of  11%  per  1  M  of  ionic  strength  (Fig.  6(b)).

Similar slopes of 6-10% per M were observed for other anions in concentrated sulfate and

perchlorate  solutions  (such  as  hydroxide,  iodide,  bromide,  and  sulfite).  [21]  The

extrapolated quantum yield for electron photodetachment from the perchlorate (at infinite

21

dilution) is ca. 4x10-3, which is 3 times lower than the QY for the water itself. In 9 M

perchlorate  solution,  almost  no  one-photon  electron  detachment  occurs;  the  electron

generation is completely biphotonic (Fig. 6(a)).

For other anions, this biphotonic excitation was negligible. Furthermore, for all

systems other than perchlorate, sufficiently high concentration of the anions can be used

to avoid the photoexcitation of water at 193 nm (section 4.1.1). A more serious concern is

the possibility that an impurity rather than the anion being studied yields electrons upon

photoexcitation. Such a dilemma presents itself for all anions that exhibit low (<0.02)

quantum yield for electron photodetachment. The presence of impurities in thiocyanate,

chlorate, and hydrosulfide solutions can be discerned from the fact that electron half time

was  considerably  shortened  in  these  solutions  (section  2).  We  believe  that  with  the

possible exception of thiocyanate at 248 nm and perchlorate at 193 nm, the involvement

of  impurity  is  unlikely  because  molar  absorptivities  of  the  low-QY  anions  (such  as

hydrosulfide,  nitrite,  nitrate  and  chlorate;  see  Table  1)  were  actually  quite  large;

moreover, these absorptivities compared well with the spectrophotometric data (Table 2).

None of the impurity ions specified by the manufacturer (that are, typically, poor light

absorbers like sulfate, chloride, and transition metal cations) can account for the observed

QYs at their expected concentrations.

4.3. Molar absorptivities for aqueous anions.

Table 2 provides a comparison between the molar absorptivities were obtained in

this study and those obtained spectrophotometrically, where such data are available. It

must be stressed that for some of these anions, conflicting estimates of the absorptivities

have  been  reported,  especially  at  193  nm,  and  it  is  not  clear  which  values  should  be

compared to ours. For most of these anions, at least one of the reported values was close

to  our  estimate.  For  some  anions  (ferrocyanide,  carbonate)  there  was  a  significant

difference;  the  origin  of  these  discrepancies  has  been  addressed  in  section  4.2.  A

surprisingly large scatter exists in the literature for iodide at 248 nm (which is, after all,
the benchmark system for CTTS studies): 400 to 900 M-1 cm-1 (Table 2). We have carried

22

out our own spectrophotometric measurement using 0.7 mM iodide solution and obtained
870±10 M-1 cm-1 - in perfect agreement with the data of Tables 1 and 2.

4.4. Estimates for "photoproduct" absorptivities.

Estimates for the molar absorptivity of "photoproducts" obtained using eq. (12)

are given in Table 3. Not all of the systems studied in this work provided good quality
data for such a measurement, though the sign of  ∂ ∂T Q Q

= 0 (and , therefore, the sign of

/

β β−

pr) can be determined for all of these photosystems (these signs are given in Table

1). The analysis of these signs suggests that at 193 nm (248 nm)  β was only greater than
β
pr   for  anions  whose  absorptivities  were  greater  than  3000  M-1  cm-1  (400  M-1  cm-1,

respectively). These values are not surprising since one of the "photoproducts", hydrated
electron, has an estimated molar absorptivity of 2300 M-1 cm-1 at 193 nm and 600 M-1
cm-1 at 248 nm [44]. To result in positive  ∂ ∂T Q Q

= 0 slope, the absorptivity of the anion

/

should be at least greater than that of the hydrated electron. For hydroxide excitation at

193 nm, this slope is only very slightly positive. Given the hydroxyl absorptivity of 500
M-1 cm-1 at this wavelength, [47] one obtains that hydroxyl and electron in sum absorb
193 nm light with ε≈2800 M-1 cm-1 - which is fairly close to the discerned "critical" value
of 3000 M-1 cm-1.

For sulfite radical, Hayon et al. [62] give an estimate of ε280=630 M-1 cm-1, from
which ε248≈1390 M-1 cm-1 can be obtained using the spectrum of this radical given in the
same  work.  Thus,  at  248  nm  ε
≈1990  M-1 cm-1  vs.  1850±190  M-1  cm-1

obtained  from  our  data  on  electron  detachment  from  sulfite  (Table  3).  For  thiosulfate
radical, Devonshire and Weiss [58] give ε375≈1720 M-1 cm-1, from which an estimate of
ε248≈5650 M-1 cm-1 can be obtained using the spectrum of this radical given in the same
work. Adding in the electron absorbance, one obtains 6250 M-1 cm-1 vs. 5046±280 M-1
cm-1 in Table 3.

The extinction coefficients for halide atoms and sulfate radical at 193 nm are not
-, Cl, Br,

known. From general considerations, one can expect that the absorptivity of SO4

23

and I increases with the polarizability. This trend is reflected in the data of Table 3. For

iodide, the "photoproduct" (iodine atom and hydrated electron) has molar absorptivity
that is much greater than 2300 M-1 cm-1 (given by Nielsen et al. for the molar extinction

coefficient of hydrated electron [44]), i.e., it is certain that the iodine atom absorbs 193

nm light. For bromide, the molar absorptivity of the "photoproduct" is close to that of the
2- and Cl-, our estimates seem to be unrealistically

electron. For the other two anions, SO4

low. This is not too surprising, since for these two anions even a relatively small error in
the  ratio  β β

  estimated  using  eq.  (12)  would  cause  large  variation  in  the  estimated

pr

"photoproduct" absorptivity (these ratii are, respectively, 21.2 and 6.1). While these latter

estimates may not be too reliable, it is clear that in many CTTS systems the absorption of

the excitation light by the hydrated electron and the radical residue of the parent anion

routinely  occurs  in  the  course  of  photoexcitation.  A  pertinent  question  is,  can  this

excitation change the QY? It is known from the kinetic studies of water ionization by

Barbara and coworkers [64] that UV excitation of hydrated electron changes the escape

yield of this electron due to the occurrence of geminate recombination suppression: the

electron is excited into the conduction band and thermalizes further from the parent hole,

so that the resulting solvated electron has higher probability of escape. A similar decrease

in the free electron yield after electron excitation has been observed for solvated electrons

generated in sodide CTTS in tetrahydrofuran. [8] According to Schwartz and coworkers,

[8,9,10]  only  electrons  that  are  close  to  the  residual  sodium  atom  (and  exhibit  fast

exponential kinetics) can be depleted via this photostimulated recombination. If that is

also the case for aqueous CTTS photosystems, the UV excitation of electrons generated

within the laser pulse is of little concern if this pulse is much longer than 10-20 ps, as is

the case in this study.

5. Discussion

5.1. Comparison with the previous estimates.

In  Table  4,  our  estimates  for  the  quantum  efficiency  of  free  hydrated  electron

generation in electron photodetachment from several anions (Table 1) are compared with

(i) flash photolysis data of Iwata et al. for 193 nm, 222 nm, and 248 nm photoexcitation

24

of the same anions, [24] (ii) ultrafast pump-probe kinetic and photometry data of Lian et

al. for 200 nm photoexcitation (both the prompt and extrapolated free electron yields are

given)  [17],  and  (iii)  the  estimates  obtained  using  product  analysis  (mainly,  using

nitrogen evolution in rxn. (1) for quantifying the electron yield) for 185, 229, and 254 nm

(Hg line) photolysis. All in all, the quantitative agreement with the data of Iwata et al.

[24] and the product analyses of Dainton and Fowles [29] is quite reasonable. Reassuring

as that may seem, this good correspondence is a result of error compensation (e.g., Iwata

et al. [24] used a 10% lower estimate for the molar absorptivity of hydrated electron). It

appears  that  Iwata  et  al.  [24]  systematically  underestimated  the  QYs  due  to  the

occurrence of light absorbance by photoproduct(s). The good agreement between our 193
nm  data  for  Br-  and  HO-  and  185  nm  data  of  Dainton  and  Fowles  [29]  is  reassuring

because it is known from the picosecond kinetic studies of Lian et al. [17] that for these

two anions, most of the geminate decay occurs in less than 50 ps and, therefore, geminate

scavenging  via  rxn.  (1)  is  minimal.  This  is  not  the  case  for  polyvalent  anions  such  as

sulfate, and QYs estimated from the N2 evolution for such anions can be overestimated

considerably. For ferrocyanide, almost no geminate decay was observed in the first 500 fs

after 200 nm photoexcitation of this anion, [17] and the closeness of the QY in 193 nm

photoexcitation to the prompt (near unity) electron yield is not surprising. For 241 nm

photoexcitation of ferrocyanide, Lenchenkov et al. [13,14] observed ca. 20% decrease in

the  electron  concentration  in  the  first  1.5  ns  after  the  laser  pulse;  i.e.,  the  geminate

recombination  is  efficient  and  the  QYs  determined  using  the  product  analysis  (in  this

case, N2 and ferricyanide yields) depended strongly on the method used (Table 4).

For 254 nm photolysis of halide anions, especially iodide, the agreement between

our QY estimates and those obtained by the product analysis depends on which data sets

are  used  (Table  4).  As  explained  in  section  1.1,  the  scatter  in  the  latter  estimates  is

traceable  to  corrections  that  were  made  to  take  into  account  scavenging  of  geminate

electron in reaction (1). Most of the workers made no provision for such a reaction, and

their results are suspect. Jortner et al. [16] made the most consistent effort to make such a

correction (without the benefit of knowing the geminate decay kinetics) and their best

estimate for the QY (0.28-0.29) is close to ours. However, it should be stressed that some

of their estimates were obtained by scavenging of the electron by sulfuric acid (with or

25

without N2O in the solution) and determining the electron yield from H2 evolution; these

particular sets of data are certainly incorrect since the QY for electron photodetachment

depends on the ionic strength [21] (this effect partially explains the inconsistencies noted

by Bradforth and coworkers [4]).

5.2. Wavelength dependence.

For all aqueous anions studied in this work that yield hydrated electrons in the

course  of  248  nm  photoexcitation,  the  QY  of  electron  detachment  in  193  nm

photoexcitation is higher than in the 248 nm photoexcitation. When the QY data of Table

1 are complemented by 200 nm and 225 nm data obtained by Lian et al. [17] and Iwata et

al., [24] respectively (see Table 4), the general trend of the increase of the free electron

quantum  yield  with  the  excitation  energy  becomes  apparent.  As  mentioned  in  the

Introduction, similar increase in the electron yield has been observed by Shirom and Stein

[23] for photoexcitation of ferrocyanide and by Bradforth and coworkers for one- and

two-photon excitation of iodide [11].

It is tempting to explain this behavior, in all of these cases, by an increase in the

efficiency  of  direct  ionization  that  is  known  to  be  more  efficient  at  higher  excitation

energy [11]. However, for some polyatomic anions, electron photodetachment is not the

only  photoreaction.  From  their  kinetic  studies,  Lenchenkov  et  al.  [14]  concluded  that
electron  photodetachment  from  ferrocyanide  by  λ  >  224  nm  light  (whose  absorbance

mainly facilitates metal-to-ligand transitions) is preceded by ultrafast internal conversion

from the corresponding excited state to a dissociative CTTS state. It is not obvious that
such a conversion is 100% efficient for all wavelengths. At lower excitation energy, λ >
250  nm,  ferrocyanide  undergoes  photoaquation  (CN-/H2O  ligand  exchange)  [65]  and
thiocyanate  photodissociates  to  sulfur  and  cyanide  (for  λ  >  236  nm).  [60]  These

photoreactions may occur, to a lesser degree, at higher excitation energies and compete

with the electron detachment. In such a case, the increase in the electron yield with the

photoexcitation  energy  may  reflect  a  competition  of  the  CTTS  state  dissociation  with

these  side  photoreactions  rather  than  a  competition  between  the  latter  and  the  direct

ionization.  Furthermore,  for  some  of  these  anions  the  electron  detachment  could  be

26

concerted with other reactions. For example, photoexcitation of bicarbonate is likely to

involve a concerted electron and proton transfer because the HCO3 radical is extremely

unstable in water.  [40] This might account for a large difference between the QYs for

electron detachment in 193 nm photoexcitation of bicarbonate and carbonate. Electron

photodetachment  from  perchlorate  is  another  possible  example  of  electron  transfer

concerted with a rapid reaction of the residual radical; in this case, water oxidation (the

ClO4 radicals were observed by IR spectroscopy in a low temperature neon matrix only

[66]).

For  several  of  the  anions  studied  in  this  work  (nitrate,  nitrite,  carbonate,

bicarbonate, chlorate, and perchlorate) it is not settled whether their absorption bands in

the UV actually involve a CTTS state, as their intramolecular transitions are known to

occur in the same spectral region. [1] The occurrence of hydrated electrons does not settle

the  issue  since  these  electrons  can  be  generated  via  a  direct  ionization  that  does  not

involve  a  CTTS  state.  Nevertheless,  relatively  large  QYs  for  bicarbonate,  nitrite,  and,

especially, carbonate suggest that their CTTS states are indeed involved. For nitrite, this

involvement  has  been  suggested  by  Blandamer  and  Fox  [1]  who  deduced  it  from  the

polarity effects on the position of high-energy, high-intensity subband.

5.3. Prompt  vs. free electron yield.

The QY for the free electron is given by a product of two quantities: the prompt

QY  of  the  electron  and  the  fraction  of  photogenerated  electrons  that  escape  geminate

recombination. Only ultrafast kinetic studies can give an estimate for these two quantities

separately,  and  more  detailed  discussion  of  the  prompt  quantum  yields  will  be  given

elsewhere. Combining the 220-250 nm results of Bradforth and coworkers [3-7,11] and

200  nm  results  of  Lian  et  al.  [17]  (Table 4),  it appears  that the prompt QY  for  halide

anions  is  near  unity  across  the  entire  CTTS  band  whereas  the  prompt  QY  for

pseudohalides is much lower, ca. 0.3-0.4 at the band maximum. The constancy of the

prompt QY across the CTTS band is not a general property of the aqueous anions. For

thiocyanate, the fraction of the escaped electrons increases by ca. 20% from 225 nm to

200 nm. [17] It is unlikely that this fraction changes by an order of magnitude between

27

248 nm and 225 nm, as would be required to account for the QY of ca. 0.02 (at 248 nm,

Table 1) provided that the prompt QY is constant between 200 and 248 nm (Table 4).

The free electron QY for thiosulfate and hydrosulfide photoexcited by 248 nm light is >

10 times less than that for their 193 nm photoexcitation; again, it seems unlikely that a

change in the escape fraction can be sufficiently great to account for this large decrease in

the free electron yield.

6. Conclusion.

Time  resolved  transient  absorption  spectroscopy  has  been  used  to  determine

quantum yields for electron detachment in 193 and 248 nm laser photolysis of fifteen

aqueous anions, including several anions for which no QYs have been reported (Table 1).

Molar  extinction  coefficients  for  these  anions  at  the  laser  wavelength  were  also

determined (Tables 1 and 2) so that accurate cross sections for electron photodetachment

can be calculated from the data of Table 1. Furthermore, we have estimated the molar

absorptivity of several photoproducts at these wavelengths; those estimates are given in

Table 3. Our results for 193 nm photolysis of halide and pseudohalide anions correspond

well with the previous estimates by Iwata et al. [24] and Dainton and Fowles, [29] and we

suggest using these photosystems as convenient short-wave actinometric standards for

aqueous  photochemistry.  We  also  confirm  the  previous  measurements  of  the  quantum

yields of water ionization (193 nm one photon excitation) [37] and hydrogen peroxide

dissociation  (248  nm  photoexcitation); [38,45]  the  latter  photosystem  also  provides  a

convenient actinometric standard for time-resolved studies.

It is shown that the QY for free electron formation systematically increases with

the  excitation  energy,  due  to  the  increased  efficiency  of  direct  ionization  at  higher

excitation energy and blocking of the alternative photoreaction routes. Relatively large

QYs for electron generation in 193 nm photolysis of bicarbonate, nitrite, and carbonate

suggest  that  their  CTTS  states  are  involved  in  the  photoreaction,  as  was  suggested  by

Blandamer  and  Fox.  [1]  Our  data  indicate  that  for  polyatomic  anions,  both  the  free

electron  QY  and  the  prompt  electron  QY  increase  with  the  photoexcitation  energy,

whereas for ferrocyanide and halides, the prompt electron QY is near unity across the

28

whole CTTS band(s). Some of the anions were shown to be involved in thermal reactions

(protic  equilibria  and  ion  pairing)  that  have  significant  implications  for  their

photochemistry. Furthermore, as shown in Part II of this series [21] (and, for perchlorate,

in this paper), the QY of electron detachment and the fraction of escaped electrons both

decrease with an increase in the ionic strength when the latter is in the molar range. All of

these  observations  point  to  the  complexity  of  the  primary  photoprocess;  there  is  little

support  for  a  popular  claim  that  CTTS  systems  provide  "simple"  models  for  studying

more involved electron transfer reactions.

Fig. 1.

(a) Maximum transient absorbance of 600 nm analysing light in 248 nm laser excitation

of a solution containing 24.3 mM (open squares) and 41.3 mM (open circles) hydrogen

peroxide and 1 M KHCO3 plotted vs. the absorbed laser power. The kinetic traces are

shown in Fig. 1S(a). This 600 nm absorbance signal is from carbonate radical formed by

rxn. (19); it is proportional to the yield of hydroxyl radicals photogenerated in rxn. (18).

The solid line is a least squares exponential fit using eq. (2) (compare this plot with the

simulated dependence given in Fig. 1S). The negative curvature is due to the absorbance

of 248 nm excitation light by photogenerated OH radicals (see Fig. 2S and section 4.1.2).

(b) The concentration dependence of  OD L

 ratio (hereafter L is the optical path of the

248

excitation  light).  The  optical  density  OD248   of  the  solution  was  determined  by

extrapolation  of  the  transmission  data  of  Fig.  2S(b)  to  zero  Q.  Molar  absorptivity  of

hydrogen peroxide at 248 nm can be determined from the slope of this plot.

The [Na2CO3]  dependence  of  the  optical  density  of  the  carbonate  solution  at  the  laser

wavelength (to the right) and "quantum yield" of photoelectron (to  the  left) in 193 nm

laser  photoexcitation  of  this  solution.  The  concentration  dependence  of  the  "quantum
yield"  φ  (given  by  eq.  (20)  and  nonlinearity  of  OD193 vs.  [carbonate]  plot  originate

through the photoexcitation of hydroxide which is present in the carbonate solution due

to (dark) protic equilibria. The solid lines were obtained by least squares fit of the data

using eq. (20).

The concentration of ferrocyanide was 50 µM (open squares), 100 µM (open triangles),
240 µM (open diamonds), 480 µM (open circles), and 695 µM (filled circles). The solid

Formation and decay kinetics of transient absorbance in 248 nm laser photolysis of 2 mM
sodium iodide solution (ca. 0.03 J/cm2 flux of incident photons per pulse). Traces (i) and

(ii)  were  obtained  from  N2-saturated  solution;  traces  (iii),  (iv),  and  (v)  were  obtained

from CO2-saturated solution. Carbon dioxide served as a hydrated electron scavenger.

Traces  (i)  and  (iv)  are  of  700  nm  absorbance,  traces  (ii)  and  (iii)  are  of  400  nm

absorbance, and trace (v) is of 590 nm absorbance. The dashed line is scaled down trace

(iii). The delayed formation of transient absorbance in traces (ii), (iii), and (iv) is due to

For  β

a  negative  curvature  (eq.  (16)).  Since  OH  radicals  strongly  absorb  248  nm  light  (an
estimate of  ε
)OH ≈508  M -1  cm-1 was  obtained from the  laser light  transmission  data
shown  in  Fig.  2S(b)),  the  photoconversion  plot  is  curved.  Bold  yellow  line:  the  least

the photoelectron absorbance (b,d) for several concentrations of sodium bicarbonate (a,b)
and potassium  hydroxide  (c,d).  The  power  dependence  shown  in  (b)  was  obtained  for
I0=6.9 mJ and four concentrations of bicarbonate (4.8, 9.1, 13,  and  19  mM).  In  (d)  the
concentration of  hydroxide  was  0.4  mM  (open  circles),  0.79  mM  (open  squares),  and
1.28 mM (open diamonds).

Photoelectron absorbance (700 nm) vs.  absorbed 193 nm  laser  power,  for  several  anion

Simulation of the data of Figs. 3 and 10S using formulae given in section 3. See Tables 1
and  3  for  the  simulation  parameters.  Note  that  photoconversion  plots  for  different
ferrocyanide  concentrations  shown  in  (a)  exhibit  much  less  divergence  for  different
ferrocyanide  concentrations  than  the  experimental  plots  shown  in  Fig.  10S(b).  As
explained in section 4.2.2, the  likely cause of this  divergence is ion pairing that  occurs in
concentrated solutions of ferrocyanide.

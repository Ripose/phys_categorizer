ABSTRACT 

Partially-coherent, quasi-monochromatic optical fields are fully described by their Mutual Optical Intensity (MOI) or the 
phase-space  equivalent,  the  Generalised  Radiance  (GR).   This paper reports  on  the  application of  a propagation-based                      
phase-space tomographic technique for determining both the MOI and the GR of wavefields. This method is applied to 
the reconstruction of the MOI and the GR of an optical wavefield propagated through a suspension of ~10 µm diameter 
polystyrene spheres.  

Keywords: Scattering, Coherence, Imaging, Generalised Radiance, Mutual Optical Intensity. 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The spatial coherence properties of wavefields are of fundamental importance since they play a key role in many optical 
imaging techniques.1 For example, it is well-known that partially coherent wavefields have the potential to carry more 
information  content  than  fully  coherent  wavefields  and  that  the  use  of  partially  coherent  illumination  in  imaging  can 
yield higher spatial resolution.2 Hence, the characterisation of the coherence properties of a wavefield embodied in the 
MOI  is  of  critical  importance  for  applications  including  imaging  and  lithography.  In  addition,  the  spatial  coherence 
properties of a lightfield evolve as it propagates through a scattering medium such as biological tissue.3 Knowledge of 
these changes in an optical field is critical to a complete understanding of imaging and the development of new imaging 
methods. In particular, once the MOI of an optical field has been determined, it can be used to predict the field in any 
arbitrary  plane.  In  particular,  provided  the  optical  properties  of  the  medium  through  which  has  propagated  are  well-
understood, the field can be ‘back-propagated’ to a plane of interest. This property of the MOI, therefore, can form the 
basis of new forms of imaging. The research presented here is aimed at developing new non-interferometric techniques 
for fully characterising partially coherent optical fields and their application to problems in imaging.  
Traditionally, measurements of the spatial coherence of a source have been obtained using double-slit experiments4 or 
uniformly redundant arrays.5 These techniques, however, provide only limited information, for example for certain slit 
separations at isolated points in the source. Various alternative interferometric techniques for determining the MOI of a 
wavefield  have  also  been  proposed  and  demonstrated6,  but  these  are  generally  complex  and  require  more  precise 
alignment  than  non-interferometric  methods.  The  technique  used  here  is  based  on  a  non-interferometric  method 
originally proposed by Nugent7 and extended by Raymer et al.8 to two dimensional fields. Subsequently, McAlister et 
al.9  effectively  reconstructed  the  wave  field  of  partially  coherent  sources  using  a  fractional  Fourier  transform  based 
algorithm.  Anhut  et  al.10  also  reconstructed  the  space  coherence  function  of  the  forward  scattering  field  for  large 
diameter (90µm) spheres employing phase-space tomography using the Radon transformation. The numerical aperture of 
their  system,  however,  was  extremely  small  and  limited  extension  of  this  method  to  media  containing  smaller 
scatterering particles.  Here we report on the development of a non-interferometric phase-space technique for recovering 
both  the  MOI  and  the  GR  of  an  optical  wavefield  and  present  preliminary  results  demonstrating  its  application  to  the 
characterisation of the optical field after propagation through a medium containing polystyrene spheres of approximately 
10µm diameter. 

2.  PHASE-SPACE TOMOGRAPHY 

1.1 Cross-correlation functions 
Quasi-monochromatic spatially, partially coherent optical fields can be described in terms of the correlation between the 
field at two points  1rr  and  2rr  using the MOI, G: 
 

                                                                     

                                                                       (1)

The reconstruction of the MOI or GR gives us a way to fully characterize the wavefield. For example, the intensity, 
at a point  rr  is given by 
 or equivalently as a projection over the momentum coordinate of the GR:

The cross-correlation function, the MOI fully describes the properties of the field, while the GR function contains the 
same information, but represents the field in phase-space.  

1.2 Theory 
The process of reconstructing the field by means of intensity measurements at different planes corresponding to different 
angles of observation is termed phase-space tomography. It can be shown7 that in the paraxial approximation as a field 
propagates a distance z its GR is ‘sheared’ in phase space:

where 

π2=k
λ

  is  the  wavenumber  of  the  field  and  λ  is  its  free-space  wavelength.  Since  the  intensity  at  a  plane  z 

represents  a  projection  through  momentum  (equation  (3)),  measurements  of  intensity  as  a  field  propagates  provide  a 
series of projections through the GR. This is the fundamental basis of phase-space tomography since these projections 
can be used to reconstruct the GR and, hence, the MOI.  

The  technique  to  be  used  here,  Phase  Space  Tomography,  involves  measuring  the  intensity 
  of  the  field  after 
passing  through  a  lens  of  focal  length  f  as  a  function  of  distance  z  from  the  lens  to  reconstruct  the  wavefield  at  some 
distance z1 behind the lens (Figure 1). In this case, it can be shown that the relationship between the Fourier transform of 
the intensity distribution, 
, are related by the 
equation: 

, and the Fourier transform of the GR at the plane of interest,

where  ρr  is the coordinate conjugate to position  rr .  According to Equation (5), in the case of a one-dimensional field we 
can deduce the existence of a one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier transforms of the intensity distribution for a 
wave propagated to a distance z from the lens and a line through the Fourier transform of the GR in the plane of interest.  

For one-dimensional fields, i.e. fields that depend on only one transverse coordinate, measurements of the intensity as a 
function of z are sufficient to completely determine the Fourier transform of the GR, and hence the GR and the MOI, in 
the  plane
.  Note  that  for  one-dimensional  fields,  the  MOI  and  the  GR  are  two-dimensional  functions.  Using  this 
procedure,  it  is  also possible  to  completely  reconstruct  the  MOI  and  the  GR of separable  fields,  i.e. fields  that  can  be 
written in the form: 

0=z

Examples of fields of this kind include Gaussian beams. In the general case of two-dimensional fields, three-dimensional 
intensity  measurements  are  sufficient  to  reconstruct  projections  through  the  four-dimensional  MOI  and,  hence,  still 
provide comprehensive and valuable information about the coherence and other properties of the field. 

Note  that  since  the  MOI  can  theoretically  be  reconstructed  at  all  points,  the  mutual  optical  intensity  and  the  spatial 
coherence function can be obtained at all points for all separations  ∆r . This would correspond to obtaining information 
from  a  series  of  double-slit  experiments  where  the  coherence  function  was  measured  when  the  slits  were  placed  at  all 
points within the field of interest and the slits were adjusted for all separations. Hence, phase-space tomography has the 
capacity  to  obtain  much  more  comprehensive  information  about  a  wavefield  than  traditional  non-interferometric 
techniques. 
 

3.  EXPERIMENT 

The experimental set-up used to obtain the MOI and the GR of the wavefield is shown in Figure 1. The light radiated 
from a single-mode fibre-coupled Superluminescent Diode (SLD) (Superlum Ltd. Model 505) with a central wavelength 
of 681 nm and a linewidth of 12 nm was collimated using a microscope objective of magnification 10× and transmitted 
through a lens of focal length 15 cm.

The purpose of the experiment is to measure the intensity distributions and hence the Fourier transform of the GR for the 
entire range of angles. The value of the angle of observation can be changed (see Equation (5)) by varying either the focal 
length (f) of the lens or the distance between the lens and CCD camera (z). In this experiment the second possibility is 
utilized with the focal length fixed at 15 cm. The propagated light field was recorded using a 1340 × 1300 pixel 16-bit 
Versarray  CCD  camera  (Roper  Scientific  Inc.)  with 20 µm  pixel  size  controlled by  a  computer.  Intensity  images  were 
recorded  at  regular  intervals  as  the  camera  was  moved  along  a  fixed  rail  Fig.  (1).  Each  image  was  obtained  with  an 
exposure  of  10  ms  while  the  camera  temperature  was  maintained  at  -20°  C.    Images  were  collected  over  values  of  z 
ranging from 4.0 cm to 33.8 cm. The minimum value of z was dictated by the geometry of the CCD camera.  

The reconstruction of the GR and the MOI of the light after propagation through a scattering medium was performed by 
obtaining intensity measurements using the same technique. In this case polystyrene microspheres (Polyscience Inc.) of 
density 1.06 g/cm3 in water were used as the scattering medium. A cuvette of path length 1 mm was filled with a dilute 
water  (80%)/glycerol  (20%)  solution  containing  microspheres  of  diameter  10 µm ± 1  µm  with  a  number  density  of 
42×106 /cm3. The cuvette was introduced into the collimated beam between the source and the lens a distance of 21.5 cm 
from the lens as shown in Figure 1 and the three-dimensional intensity distribution was obtained in the same manner as 
discussed above. To obtain an ensemble average, the sample was stirred between, but not during, exposures and three 
images were averaged at each position.  

 

  

4.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The GR and the MOI of the incident unscattered and the scattered wavefields described above were reconstructed using 
the theory described in the previous sections.  Figure 2 shows the modulus of the reconstructed MOI for the unscattered 
beam (a) and the beam after it has passed through the scattering medium (b). The MOI is also represented as a surface 
plot in the form 

 in Figure 3.

When partially coherent light propagates through a strongly forward-scattering medium, its GR, Btot, can be regarded as 
being the sum of three terms:11

The  first  term  describes  the  unscattered,  ballistic  component  of  the  optical  field,  the  second  the  contribution  from  the 
near-forward Mie scattered light and the third term the broad angle contribution. The experiments performed here have 
the potential to determine the contribution to the GR from the first two terms. The second term adds a broader pedestal 
background  to  the unscattered narrow  angle  term  in  the GR. When  considering the MOI,  on  the other hand,  the near-
  in 
forward  scattering  is  expected  to  introduce  a  more  sharply  peaked  lower  coherence  contribution  around 
addition to the broader ballistic component.  

0=∆r

From  Figures  2  and  3,  it  can  clearly  be  seen  that  the  MOI  has  been  changed  by  the  presence  of  scattering  and,  as 
predicted, there is a narrower scattered component in the reconstructed MOI superposed on a weak ballistic component. 
Note  that  the  overall  width  of  the  ballistic  component  is  the same  in  the  presence  of  scattering  as  in  its  absence.  The 
ability to discriminate between the ballistic and scattered contributions of an optical wavefield could form the basis of 
new coherence gating techniques in imaging.  

Finally, the phase space representation, the GR, is shown in Figure 4. In Figure 4(a) the GR of the unscattered beam is 
shown. It can be seen that in phase-space the angular (vertical) spread is relatively narrow. After the beam has passed 
through the scattering medium, however, there has been a broadening in the GR as a consequence of broader angle near-
forward scattering.

One  of  the  challenges  of  any  tomographic  procedure  is  the  development  of  procedures  to  process  incomplete 
information. In this case, images were obtained over only a finite range of z values which limited the range of accessible 
projections,  although  far-field  extrapolation was used where  appropriate. The  mapping of  the Fourier transform  of  the 
GR  was  also  constrained  by  the  resolution  and  size  of  the  CCD  chip  in  the  camera.  These  limitations  led  to  the 
appearance of reconstruction artefacts in the computed MOI and GR and the development of improved algorithms is the 
subject  on  ongoing  work.  Another  issue  of  importance  is  the  fact  that  the  scattering  medium  should  be  constantly 
agitated  during  image  exposures  to  ensure  the  ensemble  averaging  implicit  in  the  definition  of  the  MOI  defined  in 
equation (1). The results shown here were obtained with no stirring during exposures and averaging only three images 
and, hence, the structure evident in the broader ballistic component is believed to be a consequence of not performing 
sufficient averaging. Obtaining more consistent ensemble averaged information is another goal of this research. 

       

 

 

 

CONCLUSION 

A  non-interferometric  phase-space  tomographic  method  for  the  characterisation  of  the  spatial  coherence  properties  of 
optical  fields  has  been  presented  and  its  application  to  the  characterisation  of  wavefields  that  have  passed  through  a 
scattering  medium  demonstrated.  This  non-interferometric  method  is  straightforward  to  implement  and,  unlike  other 
methods  involving  slits  or  uniformly  redundant  arrays,  provides  complete  information  about  a  quasi-monochromatic 
lightfield including a measure of the spatial coherence properties of the field at each point in the wavefield.  Although 
research in this topic is ongoing, the preliminary results presented here demonstrate the utility of the technique. Further 
work  will  be  aimed  at  developing  enhancements  to  the  experimental  arrangements,  improving  the  reconstruction 
algorithms, performing theoretical calculations and simulations and undertaking comprehensive studies of the influence 
of scattering on the coherence of light.

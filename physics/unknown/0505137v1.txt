The  representation  of  complex  systems  as  networks  is  inappropriate  for  the  study  of 
certain  problems.  We  show  several  examples  of  social,  biological,  ecological  and 
technological  systems  where  the  use  of  complex  networks  gives  very  limited 
information  about  the  structure  of  the  system.  We  propose  to  use  hypergraphs  to 
represent  these  systems  by  introducing  the  concept of the complex hyper-network. We 
define  several  structural  measures  for  complex  hyper-networks.  These  measures 
characterize  hyper-network  structures  on  the  basis  of  node  participation  in  different 
hyper-edges (groups) and sub-hypergraphs. We also define two clustering coefficients, 
one characterizing the transitivity in the hyper-network through the proportion of hyper-
triangles to paths of length two and the other characterizing the formation of triples of 
mutually adjacent groups in the hyper-network.  All of these characteristics are studied 
in  two  different  hyper-networks;  a  scientific  collaboration  hyper-network  and  an 
ecological competence hyper-network.

1. INTRODUCTION 

The study of complex networks represents an important area of multidisciplinary 
research  involving  physics,  mathematics,  chemistry,  biology,  social  sciences,  and 
information sciences, among others [1–5]. These systems are commonly represented by 
means of simple or directed graphs that consist of sets of nodes representing the objects 
under investigation, e.g., people or groups of people, molecular entities, computers, etc., 
joined together in pairs by links if the corresponding nodes are related by some kind of 
relationship.  These  networks  include  the  Internet  [6],  the World Wide Web [7], social 
networks [8–11], information networks [12, 13], neural networks [14], food webs [15], 
reaction and metabolic networks [16], and protein–protein interaction networks [17].  

In some cases the use of simple or directed graphs to represent complex networks 
does not provide a complete description of the real-world systems under investigation. 
For  instance,  in  a  collaboration  network  represented  as  a  simple  graph  we  only  know 
whether scientists have collaborated or not, but we can not know whether three or more 
authors  linked  together  in  the  network  were  coauthors  of  the  same  paper  or  not.  A 
possible solution to this problem is to represent the collaboration network as a bipartite 
graph  in  which  a  disjoint  set  of  nodes  represents  papers  and  another  disjoint  set 
represents authors. However, in this case the “homogeneity” in the definition of nodes is 
lost,  because  we  have  certain  nodes  that  represent  papers  and  others  that  represent 
authors.  In  the  study  of  connectivity,  clustering  and  other  topological  properties,  this 
distinction between two classes of nodes with completely different interpretations may 
lead to artifacts in the data [18]. 

A  natural  way  of  representing  these  systems  is  to  use  a  generalization  of  graphs 
known as hypergraphs [19, 20].  In a  graph  a link relates only a pair of nodes, but the 
edges  of  the  hypergraph  ―  known  as  hyper-edges  ―  can  relate  groups  of  more  than 
two nodes. Thus, we can represent the collaboration network as a hypergraph in which 
nodes  represent  authors  and  hyper-edges  represent  the  groups  of  authors  that  have 
published papers together. Despite the fact that complex weighted networks have been 
covered  in  some  detail  in  the  physical  literature,  there  are  no  reports  on  the  use  of 
hypergraphs  to  represent  complex  systems.  Consequently,  we  will  formally  introduce 
the hypergraph concept as a generalization for representing complex networks and will 
call  them  complex  hyper-networks.  The  hypergraph  concept  includes,  as  particular 
cases, a wide variety of other mathematical structures that are appropriate for the study 
of  complex  networks.  For  instance,  the  hypergraph  concept  is  a  generalization  of  the 
graph concept [19, 20], block design [21], projective plane [22] and affine plane [23]. 
We  will  first  show  some  examples  of  complex  systems  for  which  hypergraph 
representation is necessary. We will subsequently define several topological parameters 
for the study of complex hyper-networks and will apply them to the study of real-world 
complex hyper-networks.  
 
2. EXAMPLES OF COMPLEX HYPER-NETWORKS 
 
a)  Social Networks 

In  social  networks  nodes  represent  people  or  groups  of  people,  normally  called 
actors, that are connected by pairs according to some pattern of contact or interactions 
between  them  [8].  Such  patterns  can  be  of  friendship,  collaboration,  sexual  contact, 
business relationships, etc. There are some cases in which hypergraph representations of 
the  social  network  are  indispensable.  These  are,  for  instance,  the  supra-dyadic 
transactions  in  social  networks  in  which  it  is  necessary  to  consider  the  coordinated 

 

2

actions of more than two actors, such as a buyer, a seller and a broker. Other examples 
include  the  scenarios  in  which  not  only  the  actors  taking  part  in  the  actions  are 
important, but other factors such as places or times in which the actions taking place are 
essential  to  describe  such  acts.  Bonacich  et  al.  [24]  have  taken  such  additional 
characteristics  into  account  in  extending  the  eigenvector  centrality  for  hypergraphs 
representing  supra-dyadic  transactions.  In  such  hyper-networks  the  nodes  represent 
actors  related  by  a  common  process,  which  is  represented  by  a  hyper-edge,  such  as  a 
commercial transaction.  

b)  Reaction and Metabolic Networks 

educts, 

A chemical reaction is a process in which a set of chemical compounds known as 
ie , to be transformed into a set of 
iP ,  which  are  produced  in  certain 

iE , react in certain stoichiometric proportions, 

other  chemical  compounds  named  products,

A  chemical  reaction  can  be  described  as  a  weighted  directed  hyper-edge  in  a 
directed  hypergraph  where  nodes  are  the  chemicals  and  hyper-edges  are  the  reactions 
[25].  The  absence  of  a  well-developed  theory  for  the  structural  analysis  of  (directed) 
hypergraphs  means  that  two  alternative  representations  of  a  chemical  reaction  are 
commonly  used.  The  first  is  the  bipartite  graph,  in  which  a  set  of  nodes  represents 
educts  and  products  and  the  other  set  represents  the  reaction  itself.  The  other 
representation consists of the  substrate graph, which considers educts and products as 
nodes – two nodes are connected if the corresponding chemical compounds take part in 
the same reaction.  

Metabolic networks can be considered as particular cases of reaction networks that 
are structurally well-characterized as they can be reconstructed for many organisms up 
to  genome-scale.  Metabolic  pathways  are  represented  in  the  form  of  graphs  in  which 
nodes  represent  molecular  entities  and  edges  represent  reactions  or  processes  relating 
the molecules involved in the reaction. However, since a reaction may have more than 
one substrate, and more than one product, the pathway is better represented by a hyper-
network  in  which  hyper-edges  represent  reactions  and  nodes  represent  molecular 
entities  [26].  As  reaction  graphs,  metabolic  networks  are  normally  represented  as 
substrate or bipartite graphs. Some problems arise when these representations are used 
for the analysis of potential failure modes in the metabolic network [27].  

 

 

c)  Protein Complex Networks 

The systematic characterization of multi-protein complexes in the whole proteome 
of an organism requires the data to be organized in the form of protein membership lists 
of the protein complexes. The most common forms of this organization are the protein-
protein  interaction  networks  and  the  complex  intersection  graphs.  In  the  first 
representation  the  nodes  of  the  network  represent  proteins  and  an  edge  links  two 
proteins that interact with  each other. This representation, however, does not take into 
account  the  multi-protein  complexes.  In  the  complex  intersection  graph  the  nodes 
represent complexes, and a link exists between two complexes if they have one or more 
proteins  in  common.  Clearly,  this  second  representation  does  not  provide  information 
about proteins. A natural way of accounting for the information about both proteins and 
common  protein  membership  in  the  complexes,  such  as  common  regulation, 
localization,  turnover,  or  architecture,  is  to  use  a  hypergraph  representation.  In  the 
protein  complex  hyper-networks  each  protein  is  represented  by  a  node  and  each 

 

3

complex  by  a  hyper-edge  [28].  These  kinds  of  hyper-networks  can  be  visualized  as 
bipartite graphs. 

 

d) Food Webs 

Trophic  relations  in  ecological  systems are normally represented through the use 
of food webs, which are oriented graphs (digraphs) whose nodes represent species and 
links represent trophic relations between species [29]. Another way of representing food 
)GC
(
webs is by means of competition graphs 
, which have the same set of nodes as the 
food  web  but  in  which  two  nodes  are  connected  if,  and  only  if,  the  corresponding 
species  compete  for  the  same  prey  in  the  food  web  [30]. In the competition graph  we 
can only know if two linked species have some common prey, but we can not know the 
composition of the whole group of species that compete for common prey. In order to 
solve  this  problem  a  competition  hypergraph  has  been  proposed  in  which  nodes 
represent  species  in  the  food  web  and  hyper-edges  represent  groups  of  species  that 
compete  for  common  prey  [31].  It  has  been  shown  that  in  many  cases  competition 
hyper-networks  yield  a  more  detailed  description  of  the  predation  relations  among  the 
species  in  the  food  web  than  competition  graphs.  A  food  web  and  its  competition 
network and hyper-network are illustrated in Fig. 1.

d)  Other complex systems 

There  are  other  fields  in  which  hypergraphs  have  been  used  to  study  complex 
systems and there are many others in which the use of hyper-networks may provide an 
interesting  alternative.  Harn  et  al.  [32]  used  hyper-networks  to  study  the  software 
evolution  process  in  which  an  evolutionary  hypergraph  was  defined  as  a  labeled, 

 

4

directed and acyclic hypergraph. A different application of hypergraphs was developed 
by Krackhardt and Kilduff, who studied the so-called Simmelian tied dyads, which are 
dyads  embedded 
three  entrepreneurial  firms  [33]. 
Hypergraphs have also appeared as a natural consequence of an L-percolation process in 
complex networks, as studied by da Fontoura Costa [34], as well as in the detection of 
hidden  groups  in  communication  networks  [35].  All  of  these  applications  clearly 
indicate the importance of hypergraphs for representing and studying complex systems.

Since

viewed as the adjacency matrix of a multigraph  G′ , i.e., a graph having multiple links 
between nodes, called the associated graph of 
 [36]. Consequently, all those 
topological  parameters  of  a  hyper-network  that  are  derived  from  its  adjacency  matrix 
are  numerically  “identical”  to  those  derived  from  the  corresponding  associated 
multigraph. However, it should be noted that multigraphs, or more generally weighted 
networks, and hyper-networks are two different ways of representing complex systems 
and  they  provide  different  information  about  the  topology  of  such  systems.  Even  the 
information  given  by  the  associated  multigraph  of  a  hypergraph  is  not  as  complete  as 
that  given  by  the  proper  hyper-network.  For  instance,  on  using  the  associated

4. SUB-HYPERGRAPH CENTRALITY  

Let  H  be a simple hypergraph of order  N . Since the adjacency matrix,  A , of  H

eigenvalues of  A , and the columns of  U  are the corresponding eigenvectors that form 
Nℜ .  It  must  be  emphasized  that,  if  the 
an  orthogonal  basis  of  the  Euclidean  space 
hypergraph  H   is  connected,  then  the  symmetric  and  non-negative  matrix  A   is 
irreducible.  As  a  consequence,  the  main  eigenvalue  A   has  a  positive  eigenvector  of 
multiplicity  one.  This  fact  facilitates  the  extension,  to  the  case  of  hypergraphs,  of  the 
use  of  the  main  eigenvector  as  a  measure  of  centrality.  The  following  result  that  was 
obtained in [37] will be useful in extending the definition of subgraph centrality [38] to 
hypergraphs.

We  define  the  sub-hypergraph  centrality  of  the  vertex  v   as  the  “sum”  of  closed 
walks of different lengths in the network starting and ending at vertex  v . As this sum 
includes  both  trivial  and  non-trivial  closed  walks,  we  must  consider  all  sub-
hypergraphs,  i.e.,  acyclic  and  cyclic.  The  contribution  of  these  closed  walks  decreases 
as  the  length  of  the  walks  increases.  In  other  words,  shorter  closed  walks  have  more 
influence on the centrality of the vertex than longer closed walks. This rule is based on 
the  observation  that  motifs  in  real-world  networks  are  small  sub-hypergraphs.  The 
extreme case is that of closed walks with a length of only two, giving a weight of zero 
 defined as 
to longer walks. This case corresponds to a vertex “degree centrality”

Consequently, we avoid this problem by scaling the contribution of closed walks to the

moment. The sub-hypergraph centrality of vertex

5. CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT  

One  of  the  most  important  topological  parameters  used  in  the  study  of  complex 
networks is the clustering coefficient. The clustering coefficient measures the degree of 
cliquishness that a network has. Watts and Strogatz defined a local clustering coefficient 
that describes “what proportion of acquaintances of a vertex know each other” [14]. In 
this  respect,  the  global  clustering  of  a  network  is  obtained  as  the  average  of  the  local 
clustering coefficients for all nodes in the network. It has been stated that this kind of 
“average of an average” [39] is often not very informative and that a better alternative is 
to  use  the  following  definition  of  clustering  coefficient  for  a  network,  which  is  also 
known in the sociology literature as the transitivity coefficient [8]:

The  factor  of  three  in  the  numerator  compensates  for  the  fact  that  each  triangle

contributes  three  connected  triples  and  ensures  that

NK . In the case of multigraphs, i.e., graphs with multiple edges, this proportion is not 
maintained  and  the  multigraph  is  represented  as  a  simple  graph  to  calculate  the 
clustering  coefficient.  A  similar  situation  is  presented  for  hypergraphs.  Thus,  in  those 
cases in which the hypergraph has multi-hyper-edges we will consider them as simple 
HG   to  the  hyper-
hyper-edges.  More  formally,  we  define  an  associated  simple  graph 
network   H , in which two nodes of 
HG  are adjacent if, and only if, they are adjacent in 
H . This is equivalent to removing the multiple links between vertices in  H .  In order 
to account for the cliquishness of a hypergraph we have to modify (8) to the following

combinatorial expression makes sense).  

On the other hand, we have to count the number of 2-paths in the hyper-network, 
which  is  the  denominator  of  the  expression  of  the  clustering  coefficient  (11).  In  this 
respect,  we  need  to  identify  the  number  of  walks  of  length  two  between  nodes  in  the 
same hyper-edge 
iE  because they do not constitute a path of length two, i.e., they are 
3=
“false” 2-paths. The number of false 2-paths is

It  is  feasible  that  we  could  be  interested  in  knowing  the  proportion  of  triples  of 
groups that are mutually adjacent in the hyper-network forming triangles with respect to 
the  number  of  triples  of  groups  that  only  form  two  pairs  of  adjacent  groups.  For 
instance,  if  we  consider  three  different  groups 
  in  a  hyper-network  it  is 
 and only one 
possible to form three pairs of adjacent groups: 
triangle of mutually adjacent groups. If we now define the clustering coefficient of the 
dual  of  the  hyper-network  we  will  obtain  the  proportion  of  triples  of  groups  forming 
triangles with respect to the number of triples forming adjacent groups:

6. ANALYSIS OF REAL-WORLD HYPER-NETWORKS 

 

 

10

We  will  consider  here  two  complex  hyper-networks  representing  a  collaboration 
network  and  a  competence  graph  in  an  ecological  system.  The  collaboration  network 
was  extracted  from  the  bibliography  of  the  book  “Product  Graphs”  by  Imrich  and 
Klavžar  [40].  The  original  network  is  a  bipartite  author-by-paper  network  where  link 
(i,j)  represents  a  situation  where  author  i  is  the  (co)author  of  the  paper  j  [41].  We 
transformed this information into a complex hyper-network in which nodes are authors 
and hyper-edges are papers in such a way that all coauthors of a paper are linked by the 
same hyper-edge. The second network consists of the trophic relation between species 
in the marine ecosystem of Benguela, which is off the southwest coast of South Africa 
[42]. We represent this network as a competence graph, as explained before, and in this 
way we obtain the Benguela competence hyper-network in which nodes are species and 
hyperlinks  join  together  all  species  competing  for  the  same  prey.  For  the  sake  of 
comparison  we  also  consider  the  author-by-author  complex  networks,  representing 
those pairs of authors that have published a joint paper, as well as the competence graph 
of the Benguela food web. 

We begin by analyzing the characteristics of the degree of centrality in the hyper-
networks studied and compare them with the corresponding network representations of 
the same complex systems. One of the distinctive characteristics of centrality measures 
is that they allow the nodes of the network to be ranked in order to determine the most 
central  ones  in  such  a  system.  The  relative  degree  of  centrality  for  the  most  central 
authors in the “Graph Product” collaboration network are plotted in Fig. 2A according 
to three different representations of the system: network, weighted network and hyper-
network. As can be seen, the ranking obtained for the authors is completely different for 
the three representation methods. It was found that Hell is the most central author in the 
simple  network,  whereas  Klavžar  and  Imrich  are  more  prominent  in  the  weighted 
network  and  in  the  hyper-network,  respectively.  There  are  some  other  authors  that 
appear highly ranked in one of the representations but do not appear among the top ten 
authors  in  the  others.  For  instance,  Zhu  is  ranked  as  the  fifth  author  according  to  the 
hyper-network  representation  but  does  not  appear  among  the  top  ten  authors  in  the 
network and weighted network. Imrich and Klavžar are the most central authors in the 
complex  hyper-network.  This  means  that  they  appear  in  the  largest  number  of  hyper-
edges, which represent the different collaboration groups in the hyper-network. We give 
the term collaboration group to the set of authors that collaborate together in a paper. 
Imrich  and  Klavžar  participate  in  26  and  22  collaboration  groups,  respectively,  while 
Hell  participates  in  only  8  collaboration  groups  –  despite  the  fact  that  he  has  12 
collaborators.  It  is  clear  that  you  can  have  N  collaborators  but  participate  in  only  one 
collaboration  group  if  all  your  collaborators  participate  in  the  same  paper.  The 
importance  of  participating  in  different  collaboration  groups  is  evident  from  the 
following perspective. If your N collaborators are in only one group and all of them can 
share the same series of ideas, i.e., they form a “school”. However, if you are taking part 
in two or more collaboration groups you will be in touch with more than one school of 
thought and share ideas from different perspectives. This makes nodes participating in 
larger  numbers  of  collaboration  groups  (hyper-edges)  the  most  central  nodes  in  the 
hyper-network. 

A similar situation is represented in Fig. 2B, where the relative degrees based on 
simple network and hyper-network are plotted for all species in the competence network 
and hyper-network of the Benguela ecosystem. In the competence network there are 10 
species  ranked  as  the  most  central  ones,  all  of  which  have  a  degree  equal  to  22.  This 
means that each of these species competes for 22 types of prey. For instance, anchovy,  
horse and chub mackerel all compete for the same number of prey as sharks and birds in 

 

11

that  they  all  have  a  centrality  degree  equal  to  22  in  the  competence  network.  The 
possibility  exists  that  most  of  the  prey  for  which  a  group  of  species  compete  are  the 
same. We assign the term  competence group to this group of species that compete for 
the  same  prey.  The  competence  network  does  not  allow  us  to  know  in  how  many 
competence groups a particular species is participating. However, this information can 
be obtained in a straightforward way from the competence hyper-network. In this case 
the node degree corresponds to the number of competence groups in which a species is 
participating. In the hyper-network representation of the Benguela ecosystem, sharks are 
the most central species followed by birds and seals. Sharks participate in 18 different 
competition groups while birds participate in 16 and seals in 15. In contrast, anchovy,  
horse and chub mackerel participate in only 4 competence groups, which makes sharks, 
birds and seals the most central species in the competence hyper-network.

Fig. 3A). Hell, who is the most central author in the collaboration network, is not among 
the top ten authors in the hyper-network. In general, 50% of the authors ranked in the 
top ten most central nodes in the hyper-network do not appear in the network and vice-
versa.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  significant  differences  between  the  ranking

central ones. They include sharks and birds – but not seals – along with horse and chub 
mackerel, hake, other pelagics and other groundfish.

The  clustering  coefficient  of  the  Benguela  competence  hyper-network  is

 because there are 14 hyper-triangles and 625 paths of length two. Only 
two  hyper-triangles  exist  in  the  “Graph  Product”  collaboration  network,  which  has  a 
 (there are 377 paths of length 2). These values indicate a 
clustering of 
low  transitivity  in  the  hyper-network  as  the  number  of  hyper-triangles  formed  is  low 
compared  to  the  number  of  paths  of  length  2.  Each  hyper-triangle  in  a  hyper-network 
represents a triple of nodes that join together three different groups (hyper-edges). For 
instance,  the  hyper-triangle 
  is  formed  by  three  trophic  species

 measures the proportion of triples of 
clustering coefficient of the hyper-network 
nodes that join three different groups with respect to the number of triples that only join 
two different groups. With the aim of extracting more conclusive results concerning the 
role played by transitivity in complex hyper-networks, we propose the further study of 
random hyper-networks in order to show whether real-world hyper-networks show, for 
instance,  “small-world”  characteristics  as  observed  for  complex  networks.  A  value  of 
=HC
  is  obtained  for  the  competition  graph  of  the  Benguela  ecosystem, 
which  is  close  to  1.  This  result  indicates  a  high  level  of  interrelationship  between  the 
different competition groups in these ecosystems. An analysis of this factor for a greater 
dataset of food webs is necessary to obtain definitive conclusions about the role of this 
interrelation in ecological systems. The collaboration network on “Product Graphs” also 
shows  a  high  value  of  the  clustering  coefficient  between  collaborating  groups, 
=HC
.  This  result  is  not  unexpected  given  the  limited  scope  of  the 
collaboration topic, which makes the different groups working in the field collaborate to 
a large extent.

7. CONCLUSIONS 

We  have  introduced  here  some  basic  principles  for  the  use  of  more  general 
representations  of  complex  systems  based  on  hypergraphs.  We  have  coined  the  term 
complex hyper-networks to designate such systems in which nodes are grouped together 
in  multi-dyadic  relationships  represented  by  hyper-edges.  The  use  of  complex  hyper-
networks appears to be a necessity for exploring several social, technological, biological 
and  ecological  systems  beyond  the  traditional  dyadic  representation  of  node-node 
relationships.  We  have  introduced  several  valuable  measures  for  studying  complex 
hyper-networks,  such  as  node  and  sub-hypergraph  centralities  as  well  as  clustering 
coefficients for both hyper-networks and their duals. The application of these measures 
to  the  study  of  two  real-world  complex  systems  –  representing  a  collaboration  hyper-
network and a competition hyper-network in an ecological system – has shown some of 
the main differences between complex networks and hyper-networks. However, a large 
number of open questions remain concerning the representation of complex networks as 
hypergraphs.  For  instance,  are  complex  hyper-networks  “small-worlds”?  Do  complex 
hyper-networks  show  “scale-free”  characteristics?  What  is  the  large-scale  structural 
organization  of  complex  hyper-networks?  How  robust  are  complex  hyper-networks  to 
random  failures  and  attacks?  We  hope  that  the  current  work  encourages  the 
investigation of these and many other questions and that the main tools developed here 
can help in this area.

Abstract.  A  theoretical  approach  to  determine  the  optimal  form  of  the  near-field  optical  microscope 
probe is proposed. An analytical expression of the optimal probe form with subwavelength aperture has 
been  obtained.  The  advantages  of  the  probe  with  the  optimal  form  are  illustrated  using  numerical 
calculations.  The  conducted  calculations  show  10  times  greater  light  throughput  and  the  reception 
possibility of the more compactly localized light at the output probe aperture which could indicate better 
spatial resolution of the optical images in near-field optical technique using optimal probe.

1. Introduction 
The rapid development of modern technologies has drawn the researchers’ attention to the physics of the surface 
phenomena  [1].  Due  to  possibility  of  the  reception  ultrahigh  resolution  of  the  surface  images  the  near-field 
optical microscopy technique has gained a great importance. In this technique light falls into metal coated taper 
dielectric  fiber  and  goes  through  aperture  with  lateral  size  much  less  than  light  wavelength.  Due  to  this  light 
could  be  localized  within  a  small  sample  area  and  one  can  get  the  optical  images  of  surfaces  with  ultrahigh 
resolution.  A  non-propagating  (evanescent)  field  that  plays  the  main  role  in  interaction  with  the  surface  [2] 
exists in a nearby zone of the output probe aperture (figure 1). The interaction of such highly localized in space 
polarized  field  with  surface  and  individual  molecule  became  the  object  of  the  intensive  study  [3,  4]. 
Characteristics of the probe have considerable importance in achievement of the efficient light localization [5]. 
Choice  of  the  optimal  form  would  allow  one  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  light  spot  in  maximum  magnitude  and 
save the light intensity. Thus on the initial stage it is necessary to understand the interference picture of the light 
field  in  the  output  probe  cross-section  as  it  depends  on  forms  of  the  probe  used.  It  should  also  be  noted  that 
optical  probes  with  small  size  of  the  intensive  light  spot  would  open  new  areas  of  the  investigations  such  as 
nanometer nonlinear optics.  

At present there are only experimental empirical ways of the probe optimization [see for example ref.1 
and  therein].  One  of  these  schemes  of  the  probe  improvement  is  the  reception  smooth  probe  wall  technology 
realized by means of polymeric covering dielectric fiber [6]. To increase the light throughput, probe aperture is 
processed by ion beam,  avoiding absorbed impurity of the aluminum  coating [7]. It is  also offered to use the 
triangular  form  of  the  output  aperture  [8]  and  reception  of  coaxial  probe  [9]  for  increasing  the  resolution  of 
images.  

Several main trends draw attention in theoretical investigations [10-16], however, due to difficulties in 
the  calculation  of  electromagnetic  field  in  complex  spatial  geometry  in  existing  theoretical  works  a  question 
about the optimal form determination of the probe and influence of its form on parameters of output light, its 
polarization and intensity has not been set [1]. The short review of these studies is also presented in papers [17-
18]. Searching for the optimal form of the probe with accounting for real physical parameter is the subject of the 
presented paper. B. Z. Katzenellenbaum theory of the cross-sections [19] has been used in the investigations of 
the light behaviour in a narrowing probe. This method is the most suitable for calculations since it enables the 
possibility to conduct numerical modeling and get comprehensible physical picture of the light spreading in the 
real probe. The proposed theoretical approach has allowed us to set the problem of finding the optimal form of 
the near-field optical microscopy probe, which provides the maximum intensity of output radiations under given 
size  probe  apertures.  The  conducted  calculations  have  shown  that  probes  with  optimal  form  allow  one  to 
increase the light intensity approximately in 10 times with the same size of the output probe aperture.  

 

2. Analytical expression of optimal probe profile 
The theory of the cross-sections for non-uniform waveguides [19] has been used at the statement of the problem 
on determination of the optimal form of the probe. In this method, waveguide with the same radius as the probe 
has in this section is compared with each cross-section narrowing probe. The light field is introduced as set of 
the modes:

The system (2) couples modes spreading from broad part of probe and reflected modes because of the 
narrowing of the wall of the probe. The boundary condition for the total field (1) is satisfied in close proximity 
to the tilted wall [19]. Because of rapid change of the boundary conditions in the narrowing probe, the modes 
existence condition and regimes of their interaction greatly change, influencing the physical picture of the light 
field spreading. The light modes of the field are reflected, interact with mode of HE or EH types in the same and 
opposite directions when spreading in the probe. This leads to changing of the modes spatial structure and their 
amplitudes ratio [18] on output probe aperture that defines the structure and output light intensity and resolution 
of the near-field optical microscopy technique.  

The  interaction  between  modes  noticeably  increases  in  the  narrowing  probe.  That  greatly  changes 
distribution of energy in the probe on modes of the same direction and leads to modes decay [18]. From couple 
coefficients ratio it is possible to draw a conclusion that there are areas in near-field microscopy probe, where 
the main role in the carrying dynamic of the radiation is played by either interaction nearby modes, since couple

of the main mode with nearby mode has the greatest importance

 [18, 19]. The main mode has the least decay when spreading. So the general passing of 
mode 
the modes begins to decrease rapidly after the achievement of the critical cross-section  mz~  (when is executed 
)~(
) in corresponding ideal probe by main mode. The idea of the proposed approach for searching of the 
h

optimal probe geometry is as follows. Since high modes have a greater decay in probe then at excitement of the 
main mode in probe its optimal form must provide the minimum dissipation of this mode in modes of the higher 
order, minimum absorption in wall and reflection. The optimization of these mechanisms makes it possible to 
get the optimal probe profile.

In figure 2 the exact numerical solution (11) and approximate analytical solution (19) are presented. The 
difference  between  the  numerical  solution  (11)  and  analytical  solution  (19)  is  around  1-2%  and  reaches  5% 
(~2.5  nm)  in  small  area  near  output  aperture.  The  comparison  of  the  solutions  demonstrates  fairness  of  the 
assumed approximations for the subwavelength probe parameters at the construction of the analytical solution 
(19). Thereby, the analytical expression (19) is a good approximation of the equation (11) solution and describes 
the optimal form a subwavelength probe. 

At  the  small  radiuses  area  modes  wavenumbers  (4-6)  has  significant  imaginary  part  and  large  couple 
coefficients  (3)  between  modes  that  leads  to  essential  energy  dissipation  of  the  main  mode  and  absorption  in 
walls [5, 18, 19, 21]. Thence follows the important conclusion that optimization in the end subwavelength area 
of the probe will lead to the essential increase of the light throughput and the improvement its spatial features. 
Using  the  obtained  analytical  expression  (19),  the  numerical  solution  of  the  probe  optimal  form  and  other 
typical  probe  forms,  the  spreading  of  TM  light  field  in  small  end  area  of  the  probe  is  investigated  and  the 
comparisons of output light parameters are performed and the advantages of the optimal form of the probe (19) 
are illustrated.

In figure 4 throughput of the TM field energy flow at light wavelength changing within the range from 
300  nm  to  1000  nm  are  presented.  The  field  energy  throughputs  for  the  probe  with  the  linear  form  were 
determined by experimental and approximate theoretical methods in [1, 6, 7] for some light wavelengths and are 
in  agreement  by  the  order  of  magnitude  with  our  calculations,  derived  theoretically  for  the  first  time  for  the 
whole  spectral  range.  From  the  obtained  dependencies  it  is  possible  to  see  that  the  optimal  probe  gives  the 
greater energy flow of the light field on the output aperture. The comparison with the linear form of the probe 
shows that throughput of the ТМ0m field power can be increased by 10 times.

3. The spatial structure of the near-field in probe output with optimal form 
The  probe  form  significantly  changes  the  behaviour  of  an  evanescent  field  [18].  At  modes  interferences  the 
output intensity differs from simple addition of the intensities of all modes [18]. The theoretical description of 
the near field has also great importance to increase the resolution of the near-field optical microscopy technique. 
It is possible to control the distance between the probe and the sample by using modern methods of the control 
[1]. In case of small sufficiently distance the resolution ability of the spatial  measurements  of surface will be 
defined by the spatial structure of the light field in the output probe aperture, rather then by the diameter of the 
aperture.  

In figures 5, 6 intensities structure of longitudinal Iz(r, z=L) and transverse components Ir(r, z=L) of TM 
field  on  output  probe  aperture  with  optimal  and  linear  form  of  the  narrowing  for  wavelength  500  nm  of 
spreading  field  is  presented.  Such  theoretical  distributions  of  intensities  on  cross-section  of  the  output  probe 
aperture  were  obtained  for  the  first  time  [18]  and  are  in  good  accordance  with  experimental  results  of  the 
angular  distribution  diagram  measurement  of  the  output  light  polarization  in  the  far-field  [22]  at  the  linear 
polarized  light  falling  into  the  probe  with  wavelength  633  nm.  However,  the  theoretical  method  allows  us  to 
study the structure of the field precisely in the near zone. 

It is seen in the figures that there are areas with prevalence of longitudinal Ez or transverse Er field in 
cross-section of the probe aperture. However, longitudinal light field defines namely the structure of the near-
field  light.  Depending  on  locations  of  the  sample  molecule  relatively  to  cross-sections  of  the  probe  the 
characteristics  of  the  interaction  of  the  light  with  molecule  will  be  changed.  So,  surface  interactions  with 
longitudinal light field will define the images resolution, gained by near-field optical microscopy technique. We 
note that the best resolution can provide the probe with high-angle 70о < α < 75о walls on the output probe area 
[18] and with high sufficiently magnitude of output intensity. The probe with optimal form in its possibilities 
combines these characteristics since it has the best output power (see fig. 4) and enough angle corner α ≈ 710 
that provides ultrahigh interference compression of longitudinal and transverse component of the light field. The 
comparison of the width intensities on figures 5, 6 shows that using the probe with optimal form can increase 
the resolution in 3 times in comparison with linear narrowing and will allow to reach the resolution in 20 nm at 
aperture diameter 100 nm. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In  the  present  work  the  approach  to  determine  optimal  form  of  the  near-field  optical  microscopy  probe  is 
proposed. The developed approach makes it possible to calculate the light field at different geometric and real 
physical  probe  parameters.  The  analytical  expression  of  the  optimal  form  of  the  probe  with  subwavelength 
output aperture is obtained. 

The  comparison  of  the  throughput  and spatial  structure  of  the  light  field  in  near  zone  at  output  probe 
aperture for typical forms of narrowing has been made numerically to illustrate the advantages of the optimal 

probe. This research has shown that in comparison with linear probe form using the optimal probe allows one to 
increase the intensity of the field at the output probe aperture by 10 times and carry out the experiments with 
such  intensive  laser  radiation  avoiding  destroying  the  probe.  We  shall  note  that  it  is  possible  to  use  the  laser 
radiation 90% smaller at maintenance intensities of the light at the output probe aperture with optimal form. 

Herewith,  the  optimal  form  of  the  probe  provides  greater  locality  and  magnitude  of  longitudinal  and 
transverse light field in distribution at output cross-section of the probe aperture. At diameter of the aperture 100 
nm intensity of TM0m light field in cross-section of the probe is localized in the area of 15-20 nm. This must 
allow  one,  in  particular,  to  raise  greatly  the  spatial  resolution  of  the  near-field  optical  microscopy  technique, 
especially at the development of the appropriate methods of deconvolution.

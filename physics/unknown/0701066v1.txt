Abstract 

In this paper, the response of a normally excited preloaded Hertzian contact is investigated in 

order  to  analyze  the  subharmonic  resonance  of  order  2.  The  nonlinearity  associated  with 

contact  losses  is  included.  The  method  of  multiple  scales  is  used  to  obtain  the  non-trivial 

steady  state  solutions, their stability, and the frequency-response curves. To this end, a third 

order  Taylor  series  of  the  elastic  Hertzian  contact  force  is  introduced  over  the  displacement 

interval where the system remains in contact. A classical time integration method is also used 

in conjunction with a shooting method to take into account losses of contact. The theoretical 

results  show  that  the  subharmonic  resonance  constitutes  a  precursor  of  dynamic  responses 

characterised  by  loss  of  contact,  and  consequently,  the  resonance  establishes  over  a  wide 

frequency  range.  Finally,  experimental  validations  are  also  presented  in  this  paper.  To  this 

end,  a specific test rig is used. It corresponds to a double sphere-plane contact preloaded by 

the  weight  of  a  moving  mass.  Experimental  results  show  good  agreements  with  theoretical 

ones.

1. Introduction 

Hertzian  contacts  exist  in  many  mechanical  systems  such  as  mechanisms  and  machines 

(gears,  cam  systems,  rolling  element  bearings,  to  name  a  few).  Under  operating  conditions, 

these  contacts  are  often  excited  by  dynamic  normal  forces  superimposed  on  a  mean  static 

load. Under excessive excitation, contacts can exhibit undesirable vibroimpact responses, as a 

result  of  clearances  introduced  through  manufacturing  tolerances.  The  resulting  dynamic 

behaviour is characterised by loss of contact and impacts, leading to excessive wear, surface 

damage and noise. 

In a previous paper [1], the dynamic behaviour of an idealized preloaded and non-sliding dry 

Hertzian  contact  was  studied  under  primary  resonance  conditions.  To  this  end,  an 

experimental  test  rig  was  built  in  order  to  investigate  the  resonance  in  detail,  including 

vibroimpact responses. Theoretical results were also presented showing good agreement with 

the  main  characteristics  of  the  primary  resonance.  In  a  companion  paper  [2],  analysis  was 

extended  to  the  case  of  vibroimpact  responses  under  Gaussian  white  random  normal 

excitation. 

The  present  work  is  concerned  with  the  subharmonic  response  of  the  identical  fundamental 

Hertzian  contact  under  harmonic  excitation.  Several  earlier  papers  discuss  the  dynamic 

response  of  Hertzian  contacts  [3–11],  but  to  our  knowledge,  theoretical  and  experimental 

analyses of the 2-subharmonic resonance are rarely presented [12]. In this paper, the dynamic 

model  studied  is  described  in  section 2.  Theoretical  results  are  presented  in  section 3,  and 

finally experimental investigations and results are presented in section 4. 

2. The dynamic model 

2.1 Equation of motion 

The  system  under  study  corresponds  to  the  single-degree-of-freedom  impact  oscillator 

shown in Figure 1. A moving rigid mass m is kept in contact with a flat surface and loaded by 

a  static  normal  force  N.  Assuming  a  Hertzian  contact  law,  the  non-linear  restoring  contact 

force  is  derived  from  material  properties  and  contact  geometry  [13].  When  the  system  is 

excited  by  a  purely  harmonic  normal  force  superimposed  on  the  static  load,  the  equation  of 

motion may be written as follows:

where z is the normal displacement of the rigid mass m measured such that z<0 corresponds 

to loss of contact, c is a damping coefficient, and k is a constant given by the Hertzian theory. 

Furthermore,  s   controls  the  level  of  the  excitation  and  w   denotes  the  excitation  angular 

frequency. 

When the excitation force is zero, the static contact compression zS is given by  

we introduce the linearized contact natural frequency W  and the damping ratio z  given by

2.2 Approximation of the elastic contact force 

In order to use the analytical method of multiple scales, the restoring elastic contact force is 

approximated  by  expanding  the  non-linearity  in  a  third-order  Taylor  series  around  the  static 

load.  In  this  way,  both  quadratic  and  cubic  non-linearities  appear  naturally,  and  the 

approximate elastic restoring force is given as follows

This equation remains valid if the following inequality is satisfied

This inequality guarantees positive values for the approximate restoring force. In other words, 

this inequality corresponds to the loss of contact condition for the approximate system. 

Furthermore, the absolute difference between the actual and the approximate elastic restoring 

force is less than 0.01 in the range  –1 < q < 1. Comparison is shown in Figure 2.

is assumed in Eq. (11) where circumflexes indicate O(1) variables. As a result, the excitation 

appears at the same order as the free response (i.e. at the order e  0), and the damping appears 

at the same time as the quadratic non-linearity (i.e. at the order e   1). Then Eq. (11) becomes,

also be easily obtained [15]. Introducing the two critical values defined by

one can distinguish the three following regions, illustrated in Figure 3 for the case z  = 0.005. 

In region I defined by s  > s  2 , the trivial response (or 1T-periodic response) is unstable and 

subharmonic  responses  are  always  excited.  In  region  II  defined by s  1 < s   < s  2 and  w  < 2 , 

the  trivial  response  is  stable  and  it  coexists  with  two  subharmonic  responses,  one  of  which 

stable,  the  other  unstable.  For  this  case,  the  stable  subharmonic  response  can  be  excited 

depending  on  the  initial  conditions.  In  region  III,  when  s   < s  1 and  w  < 2,  or  when 

s   < s  2 and  w  > 2,  the  trivial  1T-periodic  response  is  always  stable  and  subharmonic 

response  can  never  be  excited.  In  other  words,  the  curve  s   = s  2 corresponds  to  the 

subharmonic bifurcation which is subcritical when  w < 2 and critical when  w > 2. Following 

these  results,  one  obtains  a  critical  excitation  level  s  * which  can  be  viewed  as  a  threshold 

beyond which the subharmonic resonance is always excited. This value is given according to

Beyond  this  threshold,  the  subharmonic  resonance  exhibits  a  softening  behaviour  shown  in 

Figure 4. This figure displays the frequency response curve obtained for s  = 0.5 and z  = 0.01. 

This  result  is  in  agreement  with  the  behaviour  of  the  system  under  primary  resonance 

conditions in the sense that the frequency response curve is bent to low frequency (softening 

behaviour) [1].  

-
Figure 5  shows  the  minimum  value  of  the  displacement  response  when  subharmonic 

resonance  occurs.  By  considering  the  approximate  system,  Eq.  (11),  one  can  see  that  the  2-

subharmonic response leads to contact loss. In fact, we have always observed this behaviour 

which  constitutes  a  general  trend  of  the  system.  The  question  can now be stated as follows: 

does  the  2-superharmonic  response  always  lead  to  loss  of  contact  for  the  original  dynamic 

model defined by Eq. (7)? This question requires a more detailed analysis of superharmonic 

resonance  condition.  We  therefore  supplement  this  theoretical  study  by  a  numerical 

investigation described as below. 

3.2. Continuation method  

In  order  to  achieve  dynamic  responses  including  loss  of  contact,  a  classical  numerical  time 

integration explicit scheme is used, i.e. the central difference method. The interest of using an 

explicit scheme is the estimation of the non linear restoring force which is not required at each 

time step by a non-linear solver, like the Newton-Raphson method. The counterpart is to use a 

sufficiently  small  time  step  examining  both  the  period  of  the  response  and  the  linearized 

natural frequency of the system. In our simulations, we have imposed a time step 10000 times 

less  than  the  period  of  the  response.  Further,  a  specific  computing  method  devoted  to 

nonlinear  problems  is  used,  namely  the  shooting  method  combined  with  a  continuation 

technique.  For  details  of  these  known  methods,  see  for  example  references  [16, 17].  In  our 

case, the shooting method is similar to tracking fixed points on a Poincaré map. To this end, 

we  have  chosen  a  Poincaré  section  equivalent  to  a  stroboscopic  section  at  a  period  1  or  2 

times the period of the external excitation. Finally, the required Jacobian matrices attached to 

the  fixed  points  are  evaluated  via  a  numerical  rule.  Actually,  these  can  not  be  analytically 

determinate  because  of  the  non  regular  characteristic  of  the  non-linear  restoring  force.  One 

can also notice that the stability of the response and the kind of bifurcations can be deduced 

from the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrices. 

Figure 6 shows a typical frequency-response curve which is obtained for the same values as 

used in Figures 4 and 5 (s  = 0.5 and z  = 1 %). As we can see in the upper part (Figure 6(a) ), 

the  subharmonic  resonance  is  very  strong  as  it  is  established  over  a  wide  frequency  range. 

Actually, the downward jump frequency appears to be very low (v

 »

 0.475). As one observes 

in the lower part (Figure 6(b) ) which is the frequency-response curve detailed around v

 »

 2, 

we  confirm  the  multiple  scales  method  result,  i.e.  the  fact  that  the  subharmonic  resonance 

initiates vibroimpact responses. This is of great importance in a practical point of view when 

vibroimpacts lead to excessive wear, surface damage and excessive noise. 

In  order  to describe the bifurcation set obtained by the used numerical shooting method, we 

have tracked the 1T-periodic response for different values of s   and identified frequencies for 

which  subharmonic  bifurcations  occur.  This  can  be  done  by  computing  the  multipliers  or 

eigenvalues  of  the  Monodromy  matrix  related  to  the  associated  fixed  point.  Remind  that 

subharmonic  bifurcation  occurs  when  one  of  the  multipliers  leaves  the  unit  circle  in  the 

complex plane by the –1 value. Comparison of the results with those obtained by the multiple 

scales  method  is  given  in  Figure  7.  As  we  can  see,  very  good  agreement  between  the  two 

approaches occurs. 

In our simulations, we have found that the loss of contact nonlinearity is also at the origin of 

subharmonic responses which then exhibite impacts. To illustrate this result, Figure 8 displays 

an example of frequency response curve obtained with an excitation amplitude s   quite lower 

than the threshold value s  * defined by Eq. (26). As we can see, these subharmonic responses 

take place on an isola, i.e. a loop in the bifurcation set, delimited by a couple of saddle-node 

bifurcations. This isola establishes itself in the interval 1< w < 2, which is coherent with the 

softening  character  of  the  loss  of  contact  nonlinearity.  Figure  9  displays  the  saddle-node 

bifurcation curve in the w   -

 s   plane which circumscribes the region where isola takes place. 

In  this  Figure,  the  excitation  amplitude  threshold quoted  s  **  (s  ** »

 0.165)  corresponds  to 

the isola formation at a frequency close to 1.5. It is found quite lower than the preceding one 

s  *  defined by  Eq.  (26).  Up  to  this  threshold,  we  observe that isola rapidly grows when the 

excitation amplitude increases until it meets the preceding flip bifurcation close to  w  = 2 and 

s  = s  *.  For  these  conditions,  one  can  assume  the  existence  of  an  unstable  transcritical 

bifurcation. Actually, this last takes place very close to the conditions s  = 0.336 and z  = 1 %, 

The result is of great importance as it proves that the subharmonic resonance initiated by the 

Hertzian  nonlinearity  almost  always  induces  vibroimpact  responses  in  a  wide  frequency 

as illustrated in Figure 10. 

range. 

4.1. Test rig 

4. Experimental validation 

The main goals of our experimental study are to confirm the excitation level threshold value 

defined  by  Eq. (26)  and  to  confirm  the  occurrence  of  vibroimpact  responses  initiated  by 

subharmonic  resonance  conditions.  In  order  to  perform  these  experimental  validations,  we 

have used a test rig similar to that described in references [1-2]. The used test rig is depicted 

in Figure 11. It consists on a 25.4 mm diameter SAE 52100 steel ball preloaded between two 

horizontal SAE 52100 steel flat surfaces. The first one is fixed to a heavy rigid frame and the 

second one is rigidly fixed to a vertically moving cylinder. Compliance of a rough and weakly 

loaded  contact  obtained  experimentally  can  be  different  from  the  theoretical  compliance 

supplied by the Hertz equation. So, to take into account this problem, planes were ground to 

obtain roughness Ra < 0,4 µm. Ball roughness is also weak (Ra < 0.03 µm). Then, as we will 

see,  asperities  will  be  quite  smaller  than  contact  deflection  and  contact  area.  The  double 

sphere-plane dry contact is preloaded by a static normal load N = 69.7 N, which corresponds 

to  the  weight  of  the  moving  cylinder  (m = 7.1 kg).  By  assuming  identical  mechanical 

properties for the ball and the discs, the constant k of the restoring elastic force expression is 

deduced from the double sphere-plane Hertzian contact as follows [13]: 

 

 

 

 

where  E  is  the  Young’s  modulus  (210  GPa),  n   is  the  Poisson  ratio  (0.29)  and  R  is  the  ball 

radius (12.7 mm). Then, the main theoretical characteristics of the experimental system are:

Contact  is  normally  excited  by  a  suspended  vibration  shaker.  Harmonic  normal  force  is 

applied  to  the  moving  cylinder  and  superimposed  on  the  static  load.  Excitation  force  and 

normal force transmitted to the frame through the contact are measured by piezoelectric force 

transducers. Classical charge amplifiers are used for all responses. 

4.2. Measured natural frequency and damping ratio 

Linearized  contact  frequency  (f0 = 270.6 Hz)  and  equivalent  viscous  damping  ratio  (0.5 %) 

are measured from the almost linear contact dynamic behaviour under very low external input 

amplitude [1, 6]. The experimental natural frequency is close to the theoretical one since the 

relative  error  is  less  than  0.15 %,  and  the  damping  ratio  value  is  coherent  with  preceding 

studies [1-2, 6]. 

4.3. Experimental subharmonic resonance  

For this set of experimental results, it is important to say that good repeatability was always 

observed.  Experimental  subharmonic  resonance  is  exhibited  for  external  input  amplitude 

s   up  to  20 %.  This  value  can  be  considered  as  the  critical  excitation  level s  *  theoretically 

defined by Eq. (26) or Eq. (27). By considering the measured viscous damping ratio (0.5 %),

first harmonics of the transmitted force, quoted H1 and H2 and respectively associated to the

to the 2-subharmonic resonance are clearly observed. In particular, tracking the H2 component 

allows  to  identify  one  of  the  two  flip  bifurcations.  The  subharmonic  resonance  leads  to 

intermittent  loss  of  contact.  This  source  of  nonlinearity  noticeably  dominates  the  dynamic 

behaviour  of  the  system.  Actually,  Figure 13  shows  that  it  strongly  bends  the  frequency 

response  curve  to  low  frequency  with  a  downward  jump  frequency  less  than  the  linearized 

contact  natural  frequency.  So,  for  decreasing  external  input  frequency,  dynamic  vibroimpact 

response is established over a wide frequency range, at least from 2W  to W . In fact, this result 

is obtained for all the experimental conditions, even for an external input amplitude close to 

the amplitude threshold s  * »

 20 %.  

Finally, time histories of the dimensionless normal force observed in subharmonic resonance 

conditions  are  displayed  in  Figures 14  and  15.  Notice  that  the  contact  force  Fexp  is 

dimensionalized after centered it regards to the static load as follows:  

 

Fexp

(30) 

So, contact is lost when the dimensionless normal contact force is under the -1 value. 

These  are  obtained  in  the  same  conditions  that  those  imposed  in  Figure  12,  i.e.  with  an 

external input amplitude s   »

 30 %. The flip bifurcation is clearly identified when the period 

of  the  normal  force  is  twice  of  its  of  the  external  excitation.  Time  histories  show  also  the 

hardening  behaviour  of  the  dynamic  system  in  compression  and  its  softening  behaviour  in 

-
extension.  Finally, plates  shown  in  Figure  15  correspond  to  the  flight  duration  when loss of 

contact occurs. 

5. Conclusion 

In this study, the dynamic response of an impacting Hertzian contact subjected to an order-2 

subharmonic  excitation  is  analyzed.  The  critical  excitation  level beyond  which  subharmonic 

resonance always occurs is theoretically predicted and experimentally confirmed. Beyond this 

excitation  level,   response  is  quickly  characterized  by  vibroimpacts  and  the  dynamic 

behaviour  is  mainly  governed  by  loss  of  contact  nonlinearity.  Although  contact  stiffness  is 

modelled by a linear law in most o classical impact models, we showed that the nonlinearity 

inherent  in  the  Hertzian  law  or  more  general  law,  contact  laws  cannot  be  ignored  if  one 

wishes  to  predict  vibroimpact  response,  because  it  is  this  nonlinearity  which  initiates  the 

subharmonic resonance.

Abstract 

Usage of electrodes made of glass with low bulk resistivity seems to be a promising way to 
adapt  the  Resistive  Plate  Chambers  (RPC)  to  the  high-rate  environment  of  the  upcoming  CBM 
experiment. A pilot four-gap RPC sample with electrodes made of phosphate glass, which has bulk 
resistivity in the order of 1010 Ω cm, has been studied with MIP beam for TOF applications. The 
tests  have  yielded  satisfactory  results:  the  efficiency  remains  above  95%  and  the  time  resolution 
stays  within  120 ps  up  to  the  particle  rate  of  18 kHz/cm2.  The  increase  in  rate  from  2.25  to 
18 kHz/cm2 leads to an increase of estimated ‘tails’ fraction in the time spectrum from 1.5% to 4%.

Introduction 

1. 
The  goal  of  the  CBM1  experiment,  proposed  at  the  future  FAIR  accelerator  facility  (GSI, 
Germany),  is  the  study  of  strongly  interacting  matter  under  extremely  high  net  baryon  densities  and 
moderate temperatures [1]. This as yet unexplored part of the QCD phase diagram is expected to be 
probed in fixed-target nucleus-nucleus collisions with beam energies between 10 and 40 A GeV. The 
CBM  setup  will  have  to  deal  with  an  event  rate  of  10 MHz,  which,  multiplied  by  a  factor  of  about 
1000  charged  particles  produced  in  each  event,  creates  an  unprecedented  experimental  challenge.  In 
particular,  all  CBM  sub-systems  will  be  required  to  operate  efficiently  and  consistently  during  the 
whole period of data taking in high radiation environment. 

The  Time-of-Flight  (TOF)  system  of  the  CBM  experiment  is  proposed  to  be  assembled  of 
Resistive  Plate  Chambers  (RPC),  which  by  now  have  become  a  reliable  and  proven  tool  for  timing 
measurements [2–5]. The TOF wall will be positioned about 10 m apart from the target, cover about 
100 m2  and  provide  the  timing  accuracy  of  less  than  100 ps  with  almost  100%  detection  efficiency. 
There  are  a  number  of  technical  parameters  that  remain  to  be  addressed,  such  as  the  high-rate 
capability, long-term stability and reliable overall performance of the TOF system.

2.  CBM TOF requirements for RPC 

RPC,  normally  used  for  TOF  applications,  are  multi-gap  chambers  operated  in  the  saturated 
avalanche mode. They typically consist of several planar glass plates, 0.5–2 mm thick, which are kept 
apart  at  a  fixed  distance  of  0.2–0.4 mm.  A  high  and  uniform  electric  field  of  8–11 kV/mm  applied 
between the electrodes yields immediate avalanche amplification of initial ionization produced in the 
gas.  Time  resolution  and  detection  efficiency  of  multi-gap  RPC  (MRPC)  as  well  as  dependence  of 
these  characteristics  on  main  chamber  parameters  have  been  subjected  to  careful  studies  with  MIP 
beams [6,7]. Tested detectors have demonstrated excellent TOF performance, which combines a wide 
efficiency plateau (with efficiency staying close to 100%), high timing resolution (confidently below 
100 ps) and a wide streamer-free range in the high voltage. Improvement of the MRPC time resolution 
with increasing number of gaps and electric field strength has been observed. 

To adapt the CBM TOF system design for the tasks of the experiment, simulations of physical 
events  have  been  performed  in  the  framework  of  the  CbmRoot  [8]  software,  which  is  based  on  the 
GEANT3  [9]  and  Root  [10]  packages.  For  simplicity,  the  TOF  wall  was  described  as  a  10 × 10 m2 
plane with a 0.8 × 0.8 m2 hole in the middle, positioned 10 m apart from the target. The RPC filling 
was represented as layers of Al–Gas–Glass–Gas–Al with corresponding thicknesses of 0.2–0.12–0.54–
0.12–0.2 cm. Default descriptions of other CBM sub-systems had been already included in CbmRoot.

The TOF detector occupancy is important

Fig. 2 is the simulated density of charged tracks

the  vicinity  of  the  beam  pipe  the  track  density 
increases  up  to  about  1 track/dm2.  Under  such  conditions,  an  acceptable  occupancy  of  10%  can  be 
established  if  the  size  of  the  basic  RPC  cell  is  about  10 cm2.    This  value  determines  the  granularity 
limitation for the CBM TOF system, at least in its innermost part.

3.  Low-resistive 

phosphate  glass  for 
RPC electrodes 

The  RPC  rate  capability 
is 
limited  by  the  time  interval  needed 
for  a  localized  discharge  to  dissolve 
from the glass electrode. With all the 
other parameters of RPC being fixed, 
this  time  is  determined  by  the  bulk 
resistivity  of  glass.  The  resistivity  of 
(~1013 Ω cm) 
conventional 
glass 
results  in  the  rate  capability  of  RPC 
being  as  low  as  several  hundred 
Hz/cm2, which is unacceptable for the 
CBM  TOF  system.  Usage  of  low-
resistive  glass  with  the  resistivity  of 
1010–1011 Ω cm  is  an  attractive  way 
of improving the RPC rate capability.

commercially available window glass with the bulk resistivity of less than 1012 Ω cm. One of the most 
promising materials for the RPC electrodes is a semiconductive glass, of which there are three known 
types:  phosphate,  silicate  and  borosilicate.  All  three  contain  oxides  of  transitional  elements,  possess 
electron  type  of  conductivity  and  have  a  relatively  low  bulk  resistivity  of  108–1011 Ω cm.  They  are 
black  in  color  and  opaque  for  the  visible  light.  As  compared  to  window  glass,  technology  of  the 
semiconductive glass production is more complicated, the resulting glass resistivity is sensitive to the 
chemical composition of raw material and glass melting procedure.  

The  phosphate  glass,  used  in  the  pilot  RPC  (described  later  in  Section  4),  was  molded  into 
samples sized 100 × 100 mm2, several mm thick. These samples were then filed down to the thickness 
of  2 mm  and  polished.  The  measured  dependence  of  glass  bulk  resistivity  on  the  applied  voltage  is 
presented  in  Fig.  3.  With  voltage  being  within  the  limit  of  several  hundred  volts, the  resistivity  was 
found to be in the order of 1010 Ω cm.

A sketch of the tested RPC prototype with electrodes made of phosphate glass is shown in Fig. 4. 
Six cut and polished glass plates, sized 50 × 55 × 2 mm3, were arranged in two double gap stacks with 
the intermediate glass plates left electrically floating. Gap sizes (0.3 mm) were fixed with fishing-line 
spacers, which ran directly through the RPC working area. Carbon resistive tapes were used to apply 
high voltage to the stack. Signal pulses could be taken either from both anode and cathode pads with 
the  sensitive  areas  of  40  ×  40 mm2  (differential  readout)  or  exclusively  from  the  central  anode  pad 
(single readout). The dark rate was found to be about 2100 Hz.

5.  RPC tests with beam 
Beam tests of the chamber described above were performed with 1.28 GeV/c π–-mesons at the 
ITEP  PS.  The  RPC  gas  filling  was  mixed  of  85% C2H2F4  + 5% iso-C4H10  + 10% SF6.  The  beam 
focusing  could  be  adjusted  with  a  collimator,  the  corresponding  range  of  RPC  rate  density  being  0–
18 kHz/cm2. Monitored with a MWPC, the beam profile was found to stay uniform over the area of 5 
× 5 mm2 in the RPC plane. No means to monitor the temporal bunch uniformity were available. 

The  size  of  the  trigger  area  was  1.8  ×  1.8 cm2,  determined  by  two  scintillation  counters 
positioned cross-wise before  the tested  RPC. The  same counters produced the start signal for timing 
measurements, the time resolution of each counter being about 50 ps. The MIP events were triggered 
with  these  two  counters  in  coincidence  with  a  beam  monitor  consisting  of  two  larger  scintillation 
counters placed before and after the RPC. The beam monitor was also used to calculate the RPC rate. 

The front-end electronic channel was based on a commercially available MAX 3760 amplifier2 

with the following parameters:

The  amplifier  noise  contribution  into  the  overall  detector  time  resolution  was  found  to  be  less

After  amplification,

timing 
measurements.  Signal  charges  Q  were  measured  with  a  charge-sensitive  Le  Croy  QDC  2249  with  a 
50 ns gate. Time T was measured with a discriminator coupled to a Le Croy TDC 2228. Data readout 
and further processing were performed by means of an IBM PC. To make the slewing T–Q-correction, 
a  polynomial  fit  was  applied  to  the  measured  event  distribution  in  the  time-charge  coordinates.  The 
range of the slewing correction along the T-axis was as large as 1 ns. The corrected data was then used 
to calculate the RPC timing parameters.

6.  Results and discussion 

The results of efficiency and time resolution measurements under different rates in the range of 
2.25–18 kHz/cm2 are summarized in Fig. 5. The increase in rate leads to a degradation of efficiency 
from 98% to 95%, while the time resolution gradually deteriorates from 90 ps to 120 ps.

To illustrate this effect, Fig. 6 shows charge (Fig. 6a) and T–Q-corrected timing spectra (Fig. 6b) 
of the tested RPC corresponding to four rate values. The essential statistical information and fit results 
may be found directly on the plots. The RPC time resolution is traditionally calculated by fitting the 
corrected timing spectra with Gaussian distribution and subsequent quadratical subtraction of the time 
resolution of the start system from the Gaussian sigma. However, the true shapes of the timing spectra 
are  not  exactly  Gaussian,  they  have  ‘tails’  on  both  sides,  and  this  distinction  becomes  more  visible 
with  increasing  rate  density.  The  ‘tails’  impair  the  actual  time  resolution  and  as  a  result  weaken  the 
RPC performance in terms of precise particle identification.

Fig. 6. Measured RPC characteristics under different rates: (a) charge and (b) T–Q-corrected timing spectra. 

The rate values and statistical information are printed on the plots. 

The ‘tails’ fraction may be estimated as tail = 1 – n3σ/n, where n and n3σ are respectively the total 
number  of  effective  events  in  the  timing  spectrum  and  the  number  of  events  within  the  three-sigma 
limit of the Gaussian fit (such an estimate is rough since it significantly depends on the T–Q-correction 
and  fitting  results).  The  calculated  ‘tails’  fraction  is  plotted  in  Fig.  5,  where  one  can  see  that  this 
fraction tends to grow linearly with rate density. On the other hand, the change of rate does not affect 
the  charge  spectra  of  RPC,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6a.  It  is  hence  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  ‘tails’  are 
caused by a pile-up of signals from successive events, which is a pure electronic effect. Further R&D 
is required to confirm this assumption and find a way to diminish the ‘tails’ to the least possible level. 

With  the  discriminator  threshold  set  at  0.2 mV,  the  knee  of  the  HV  plateau  for  the  RPC 
efficiency (defined as the point in HV where efficiency exceeds 95%) has been found at 5.6 kV. The 
noise  level  at  this  point  is  about  1 Hz/cm2.  The  noise  then  rapidly  increases  with  increasing  HV, 
surpassing  100 Hz/cm2  at  HV  ≈  6.2 kV  and  leading  to  the  unstable  behavior  of  the  chamber.  This 
effect  may  signify  that  phosphate  glass  is  probably  not  the  best  solution  for  the  high-rate  RPC,  and 
other types of low-resistive glass have to be investigated in the near future. 

7.  Conclusion 

Simulations predict that the innermost part of the CBM TOF system, proposed to be assembled 
of RPC cells, will be operated under extreme hit rates of about 20 kHz/cm2. To improve the high-rate 
capability  of  RPC,  usage  of  electrodes  made  of  low-resistive  glass  was  suggested.  Phosphate  glass 
with the bulk resistivity in the order of 1010 Ω cm was the first such glass to be tested.  

A multigap RPC prototype of the minimal (4 × 0.3 mm gaps) configuration with electrodes made 
of  phosphate  glass  has  been  tested  with  a  beam  and  has  shown  satisfactory  behavior  in  terms  of 
efficiency  and  time  resolution.  The  increase  in  rate  from  2.25  to  18 kHz/cm2  leads  to  acceptable 
degradations in efficiency (from 98% to 95%) and in time resolution (from 90 ps to 120 ps). However, 
the fraction of ‘tails’ in the RPC timing spectrum grows with increasing rate density from 1.5% to 4%. 
This feature currently represents the main disadvantage of such a chamber. Moreover, the noise rate of 
the tested RPC has shown an undesirably strong dependence on the high voltage applied.  

Despite  the  observed  degradation  of  RPC  performance  under  high  rate  densities,  the  results 
presented are a significant step forward in the development of detectors for high-rate operations and 
call for further R&D.

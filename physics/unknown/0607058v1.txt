Abstract: Pseudoscopic images that keep the continuous parallax are shown 
to  be  possible  due  to  a  double  diffraction  process  intermediated  by  a  slit. 
One  diffraction  grating  acts  as  a  wavelength  encoder  of  views  while  a 
second diffraction grating decodes the projected image. The process results 
in the enlargement of the image under common white light illumination.

1. Introduction 
 
Refractive or reflective optics cannot render a large parallax field due to their limited aperture. 
Direct pseudoscopic images are uncommon [1].  After the development of holographic images 
it  was  possible  to  appreciate  the  benefits  of  having  images  that  may  render  a  wide  field  of 
view while keeping the continuous parallax, allowing the observer to "look around" the scene 
to obtain the maximum of its visual information.   Holography and diffractive imaging may 
render  continuous  parallax  exclusively  under  monochromatic  light  or  through  some  process 
that  renders  the  final  image  monochromatic  at  least  over  the  horizontal  field  of  view.    We 
demonstrate in this paper that diffraction can be combined with a simple imaging process to 
obtain images for binocular viewing whose continuous horizontal parallax is due exclusively 
to  diffractive  elements.  We  demonstrated  in  two  previous  papers  [2,3]  that  the  ability  of 
wavelength-encoding  a  continuous  sequence  of  views  may  easily  be  obtained  by  simple

diffraction at a grating and stated that it may also be decoded at a double diffraction process 
[4,5] intermediated by a lens and a slit.  We employed a lens at the symmetry center in [4] in 
order to get more luminosity and sharpness, at the expense of a more complicated ray-tracing 
problem.  In  this  paper  we  demonstrate  now  how  a  second  diffraction  grating symmetrically 
located  in  respect  to  a  simple  slit  is  the  natural  way  of  decoding  the  light  distribution 
previously  coded  in  a  first  diffraction  process.    Symmetry  properties  are  enough  to 
demonstrate  the  generation  of  a  pseudoscopic  image,  a  kind  of  image  that  was  only  known 
from stereo photographic or holographic processes but not known in diffractive optics. 
 
2. Ray-tracing in a double diffraction imaging process  
 
Our  system  consists  of  two  identical  diffraction  gratings 
located at both sides of an aperture  a  (see Fig.1).

   The  plane  of  the  figure  corresponds  to  a  horizontal  plane  containing  the  center  P of  the 
aperture,  which  we  considered  as  coordinate  center,  while  the  lines  of  the  grating  are  in  a 
vertical direction. An object of  white  or gray  tonality is illuminated by  common white light 
diffusing  at  a  very  wide  angle,  such  as,  for  example,  from  point  A   whose  coordinates  are

,
.  We  consider  the  part  of  the  beam  reaching  the  grating,  which,  after  diffraction, 
RZ  is the distance from the slit to the first grating, made equal to 
travels toward the aperture.  
the distance from the slit to the second grating, a symmetry condition. If, for example, light 
reaches the grating at the point where it intersects the perpendicular to the aperture, it means 
that the mean direction 
 
                                               
 
ν being the inverse of the grating period and 
< λ  the mean value of the wavelength of the 
visible spectrum, about 0.55 µm.  A rather different situation could have been chosen, where 
light  impinges  the  grating  normally,  which  could  be  analyzed  with  minor  changes.  The 
aperture  is  a  simple  vertical  slit  and  we  consider  that  diffraction  by  the  aperture  can  be 
neglected because it does not affect resolution as much as the extension of the slit would. So 

><θ  of the object light must satisfy:

we  can  call  the  process  a  double  diffraction  process  or,  more  properly,  a  diffraction-
absorption-diffraction process. Light rays from an object point  A  from which light is diffused 
2x  at the first grating. Only 
in all directions may reach, for example, two different points 
one wavelength value allows the light to travel from the grating to the point  P  at the center 
of the aperture, satisfying the grating equation.  We have then for each point at the grating: 
 
                                               
               
iθ  represents the angle of incidence of light traveling from point  A  to points on the 
where 
dθ  represents the angle of diffraction for light that travels from points on the grating 
grating, 
to point  P .  λ represents the wavelength value corresponding to each ray. It must be noticed 
that in this situation the center of the aperture receives only a single ray that corresponds to a 
specific  wavelength  value.    Due  to  the  symmetry  of  the  optical  elements  all  rays  reach  the 
'x   that are symmetric to the points from where they 
second grating at points such as 
left  the  first  grating.  When  the  rays  reach  the  second  grating,  only  one  of  the  two  first 
diffraction  orders  is  considered,  the  one  that  allows  to  keep  the  central  symmetry  through 
'A . We can 
point  P . It creates a situation of perfect symmetry that renders an image point 
see this through the same Eq.(2) by using the appropriate new corresponding angles. The case 
is  not  symmetric  for  the  other  order,  which  can  nevertheless  bring  an  orthoscopic  image,  a 
case that will be described elsewhere.  Geometrically describing the diffraction direction of a 
given wavelength we obtain the relationship which describes the light path:

3. The pseudoscopic imaging case   
 
The  symmetry  that  we  described  demonstrates  that  a  pseudoscopic  real  image  may  be 
obtained which is symmetric to the object, considering the point of symmetry being the center 
of the aperture. We show this situation for two object points  A  and  B  located at different 
depth positions. See Fig.2.

   Four  rays  impinge  on  the  first  grating  at  points  C ,  D ,  E ,  F ,  whose  wavelengths 
iλ  
have subscript numbers chosen in such a way that, if one is greater than another, it means that 
'E , 
the indicated wavelengths are correspondingly greater than one another. Points 
'F , where light reaches the second grating, are clearly symmetric to the corresponding points 
where  light  reached  the  first  grating.  All  wavelengths  are  recombined  at  image  points 
according  to  the  spectral  sequence,  spreading  from  there  in  an  inverted  sequence.  The 
'B , therefore 
observer will see the image point  
receiving  a  depth-inverted  view  of  the  object.    The  image  resembles  the  previous  cases  of 
pseudoscopic images obtained with holographic screens [6] [4]. 
 
 
4. Spectral distribution and parallax effects on the image 
 
When an observer is included on the ray tracing, his viewpoint breaks the symmetry of the ray 
scheme  and  the  first  consequence  is  the  false  coloring  of  the  scene.  The  scheme  of  Fig.3 
explains  that  the  observer  sees  the  scene  in  a  horizontal  sequence  of  colors  when  looking 
around the image.

   When  his  observing  point  passes  from  position 
,  for  example,  he 
receives a different wavelength. The restrictive condition of eq.3 makes the light distribution 
coming from  the  center  of the slit  to  follow the spectral sequence. As expressed before, the 
extreme wavelength values determine the angle of viewing, and any ray that converges to an 
imaging  point  and  is  directed  to  the  eye  must  obey  the  spectral  sequence  relationship.  The 
reduced  extension  of  the  pupil  makes  light  at  the  eye  to  have  very  limited  bandwidth.    All 
wavelengths recombine at the image points and the original spectral distribution of the object 
is reconstructed there, but, since the observation is made from a certain distance, the observer 
can  only  see  one  pure  spectral  color  at  a  time.  The  viewing  of  two  object  points  also 
corresponds  to  two  wavelengths  (see  Fig.3)  for  the  observer  at 
.  If  a  wavelength 
filter is located at any point on the system there will be a selection of points at the image. 
Viewing the image is equivalent to viewing the pseudoscopic image in a hologram. When the 
observer  moves  his  head  in  a  one  horizontal  direction,  the  parallax  change  corresponds  to

moving his head in an opposite direction (in the case of looking directly at the object). When 
the field of view allows both eyes to observe simultaneously, pseudoscopy by this real-time 
situation  is  a  very  interesting  and  unique  experience.  The  projected  image  looks  like  the 
pseudoscopic  image  from  a  hologram  and,  in  a  situation  where  the  object  may  be  in 
movement,  an  animated  scene  is  possible.  Also,  no  speckle  effects  are  noticeable,  and  it  is 
possible to hide the object, making the viewing more impressive to the observer.  
 
5. Experimental results with multiple wavelengths 
  
We  employed  two  plastic  embossed  holographic  transmission  gratings  of  the  same  type, 
commercially  available  for  architectural  or  educational  purposes,  with  533±5  lines/mm 
sandwiched between two glass plates 2 mm thick. Their effective area employed was less than 
60 mm (H) x 40 mm (V). Undulations were evident on both, which prevented us from using 
their second diffraction order, where light beams appeared distorted. They were located 600±2 
mm apart in parallel position and a vertical black paper slit 0.7±0.15 mm wide was in between 
both gratings. Parallelism of the gratings planes was verified to better than ±1 mm by making 
coincident  reflections  of  a  diode  laser  beam  which  traversed  the  slit,  impinged  on  both 
gratings  and  returned  to  the  laser  exit.    Photographs  were  made  by  a  analog  camera  SONY 
video  8  Handy  cam  camera  connected  to a  INTEL CS430  web  camera  whose only  purpose 
was to act as a capture digital converter. It was connected to a Pentium I computer to get 240 
x 320-pixel resolution. 
 
   For  the  first  object we used a set  of three small filament lamps,  of the  kind employed for 
illuminating car panels. The filaments were 2 mm long, facing towards the grating. They were 
arranged in such a way that two of them were at 16 cm from the first grating and their vertical 
distance  was  3  cm,  while  the  third  one  was  1.5  cm  closer  to  the  grating.  Fig.4  shows  the 
situation for three viewpoints when the camera moved equal distances from left to right. The 
light  of  the  image  passed  from  greater  to  smaller  diffraction  angle,  and  consequently  the 
wavelengths, from longer to shorter.

   A  rod  included  in  the  scene  in  contact  with  the  second  grating  serves  as  a  reference  for 
positions. In a) the two vertically aligned lamps appear in green, and the closer lamp in red. In 
b),  the  image  color  of  those  two  lamps  is  blue,  and  the  image  of  the  other  is  red.  In  c)  the 
formerly  blue  images  became  in  deep  blue,  and  the  other  image  appears  now  in  green.  The 
three spots were slightly displaced from right to left, while the horizontal distance between the 

 

6 

spots  increased  8  %,  a  result  that  shows  the  depth  inversion  between    image  and  object  in 
good agreement with the situation (Fig.3). 
 
   For the second object, we used a halogeneous 50 W lamp with a parabolic 46 mm diameter 
faceted reflector behind it, constituting an extended object. The image (see Fig.5) is compared 
to the image of the object itself, as viewed from the same distance which the light from the 
object traversed to form the image.

   The  horizontal  angular  extension  of  the  image  was close to that of the  object,  but did  not 
allow  seeing the whole object. The  red dot  which  appears below the image comes from  the 
aligning laser indicating the  point at the second grating with zero value for the  x  coordinate.  
 
   We  can  see,  by  comparing  figures  5  (left)  and  5  (right),  that  the  elliptical  horizontal 
extension of the image indicates horizontal magnification of about x1.9. 
 
6. Conclusions 

We  demonstrated  a  new  way  of  generating  a  pseudoscopic  image  directly  from  an  object, 
which  does  not  needs  refracting  elements.  Also,  that  image  enlargement  is  possible  in  one 
direction by means of purely diffractive element and using the whole spectrum of white light. 
An aperture which gives a large field for viewpoints comes from a diffractive element whose 
construction and manipulation is much easier than that of conventional optical elements.   The 
reproduced  light  field  is  very  similar  to  the  original  object  field  where  no  magnification 
distortions  are  present,  even  in  a  longitudinal  direction.  We  showed  that  white  light  3D 
imaging  through  diffractive  optics  render  images  with  an  interesting  resemblance  to 
holographic  images.    It  is  an  interesting  possibility  for  increasing  the  aperture  of  an  optical 
system  because  diffraction  gratings  can  be  made  to  deflect  light  at  very  large  angles 
generating large angular aperture values.

Abstract

Electron beams of linear induction accelerators experi-
ence deﬂective forces caused by RF ﬁelds building up as a
result of accelerating cavities of ﬁnite size. These forces
can signiﬁcantly effect the beam when a long linac com-
posed of identical cells is assembled. Recent techniques in
computational modeling, simulation, and experiments for
20 MeV DARHT-II (Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrody-
namic Test) accelerator cells were found to reduce the
wakeﬁeld impedance of the cells from 800 ohms/meter to
350 ohms/meter and experimental results conﬁrm the
results of the modeling efforts. Increased performance of
the cell was obtained through a parametric study of the
accelerator structure, materials, material
tuning, and
geometry. As a result of this effort, it was found that thick-
ness-tuned ferrite produced a 50% deduction in the wake-
ﬁeld impedance in the low frequency band and was easily
tunable based on the material thickness. It was also found
that shaped metal sections allow for high-Q resonances to
be de-tuned, thus decreasing the amplitude of the reso-
nance and increasing the cell’s performance. For the
geometries used for this cell, a roughly 45 degree angle
had the best performance in affecting the wakeﬁeld modes.

1  INTRODUCTION

The modeling, simulation, design, and experimental
activities for the DARHT-II accelerator cell (Figure 1)
consisted of several stages in order to lower the wakeﬁeld
impedance of the cell while maintaining the voltage break-
down hold off characteristics of the pulsed power design.
For the computational simulation and RF design of the
cell, the AMOS1 code was used.

Figure 1. The DARHT-II [standard] accelerator cell
(left) and the DARHT-II injector accelerator cell
(right) are shown during high voltage and RF (radio
frequency) tests at LBL. The cells are 6' in diameter,
with 10" and 14" beampipe bores, have 1" accelerat-
ing gaps, and have less than 200kV across the gap.

The inside of the accelerator cell consisted of an accel-
erating gap, a Mycalex™ insulator, a metglas core, and

was oil ﬁlled. As part of the design and simulation activi-
ties for the cell, the material properties of the ferrite and
Mycalex used in the cell were obtained and a quick com-
parison between the simulation code and an ideal pillbox
cavity was generated to study the gridding effects in the
results. This was especially important since the ferrite
tuning effort was very sensitive to thickness variations.
The accelerator cell was fabricated to match the resulting
simulation results and both [standard] accelerator cells and
injector accelerator cells were tested experimentally2.

2  SIMULATION OF THE CELL

The AMOS 2.5D FDTD (ﬁnite difference time domain)
RF code was used to simulate the cross section of the cell.

Figure 2. The AMOS model of the original DARHT-II
standard accelerator cell includes a Mycalex insula-
tor e r=6.8 to restrict the oil. The insulator is angled
to reduce ﬁeld stress along the vacuum-side surface.
The model was longitudinally lengthened to reduce
interactions with the left/right boundary conditions
and solutions to the model include transverse modes.

Initial RF experimental results from the cell had poor
performance and the ﬁrst models had peaks at 800W
/m so
design efforts commenced to address these issues (see Fig-
ure 7.) The resonances were caused by standing waves in
the cell in high-Q regions of the cell. These high-Q
regions in the model were then identiﬁed via temporal-
spatial Fourier transforms. This identiﬁed several proper-
ties of the original cell: the high-Q regions in the cell are
in the area of the accelerating gap and in the vertical oil
column; very little energy traverses the upper corner of the
structure; and the performance is very sensitive to the gap
geometry. Due to fabrication issues, it was not possible to
consider changes to the Mycalex piece. So subsequent
design changes to the cell concentrated only on modiﬁca-
tions to metal pieces or the addition of metal inserts to the
cell.  This also allowed for easy cell modiﬁcation.

Figure 3. The temporal-spatial Fourier transform
shows the locations of the high-Q resonances (refer
to Figure 1 for the geometric layout of the compo-
nents). The image on the left is the low frequency
resonance (see Figure 7), the image in the middle is
the high frequency resonance, and the image on the
right is the pipe mode (for conﬁrmation purposes).

As part of the simulation activities it was desirable to
reduce the high-Q resonance that occurs at the low fre-
quency point near 200 MHz. The tuning of the thickness
of the ferrite tiles in the oil region were found to be a very
effective way to reduce this resonance. But simulations of
these tiles are very sensitive to the tile thickness since it
was instrumental in the tuning process. Since the perfor-
mance of the simulation code with these tuned ferrites was
critical, a study looked at the errors based on cell size.

The pillbox equation from [3] with the appropriate scale
factors to correspond to the AMOS calibrations in MKS
units has a 8.987· 1011 scale factor to convert into W
/m. A
source of error was found to be the meshing process which
changed the geometry of the solved problem — i.e. as a
result of the meshing, the geometry that was solved was
different than the initial geometry. Since the ferrite tuning
effort was very sensitive to ferrite thickness, it was impor-
tant to select cell sizes such that the ferrite and the gap
contain an integer number of cells. Failure to do so causes
an almost 20X increase in the error of the calculation (see
Figure 4).

Figure 4. The upper plot shows the results of com-
paring an analytic pillbox to the AMOS calculation.
The error is 6% (middle plot) and is caused by the
gridding effects and not by the physics code itself.
The lower plot shows the results of comparing the
same AMOS calculation with a pillbox of equal
dimensions to that of the AMOS mesh. The error in
this case is only 0.35%.

3  MATERIAL TESTING

As part of the construction of the simulation model, the
properties of the Mycalex and ferrite were measured using
line.4,5,6 This involves acquiring the [s]

Figure 5. The coaxial air-line test stand used for test-
ing the material samples is shown on the left. The
pipe is a 50W
line, has type-N connectors on each
end, and has a removable center conductor. The
torque of each bolt was set to 50 oz.-in. and was
required for calibration purposes. On the right are
shown two Mycalex samples (top row) and three fer-
rite samples (bottom row). Fit quality in the line is
important so copper tape was used to insure the ﬁt.

The ferrite was measured using the same experimental
conﬁguration as the Mycalex and Teﬂon. To be useful to
the AMOS code, the permeability has to be expanded using
a Lorentzian model:

4  CELL DESIGN MODIFICATIONS

The modiﬁcations to the cell include the tuning of the
ferrite tile located in the oil region, and the ﬂat corner
reﬂector in the vacuum region as shown in Figure 6. The
corner reﬂector was examined using different angles and
protrusions into the cell. This is a low ﬁeld stress region
of the cell and so a great deal of latitude was allowed.

ilar structures as Figure 2 but with the addition of the
thickness tuned ferrite in the oil region and the ﬂat
corner reﬂector in the vacuum region.

5  RESULTS

The redesign activities of the cell improved the wake-
ﬁeld performance of the cell by 2X of the dipole mode by
lowering the Q of the structures. The results for the injec-
tor cell further beneﬁtted from the increase beampipe bore
size (14" vs. 10") thus dramatically reducing the high fre-
quency resonance since it is above cutoff in a 14" bore.
The monopole mode for this structure is extremely small
and the quadrupole mode (6000W
/m2) does not steer the
beam and so is not detrimental to the cell’s performance.

The redesign of

the accelerator cell gap region
improved the characteristics from the original 800W
/m
down to 350W
/m. As part of this analysis, the following
relationships were observed: tuning the ferrite thickness of
the ferrite in the oil region reduces Re{Z^ } by 60W
/m /
mm (low freq.) and 140W
/m / mm (high freq.). Ferrite 5-6
mm thick was selected and to be fully tuned, the ferrite
was placed at normal incidence to the wavefronts. A cor-
ner reﬂector in the vacuum region near the gap affects per-
formance by 50-100W
/m per 30(cid:176) . The 45(cid:176) point is “close”
to the optimum angle in this design. Ferrite extending up
the oil gap reduces resonances by 20W
/m / cm (low freq.)
as long as the ﬁelds remain normal to the surface. 13-15
cm was chosen as the best compromise between perfor-
mance and assembly efforts. Changing the insulator angle
reduces resonances by 100W
(high freq.) but the
insulator also has high voltage constraints and so the
authors did not change the insulator conﬁguration.

/m / 10(cid:176)

From the comparisons with the analytic pillbox models,
it was determined that most of the error in the AMOS cal-
culations is caused by gridding effects when the discretiza-
tion of the mesh doesn’t match the physical geometry. For
those cases where the pillbox geometry was assigned to
match the cell-generated geometry, the error was less than
0.35%. These effects are especially pronounced due to the
sensitivity of the performance of the cell vs. the tuned fer-
rite thickness.

From the modeling and experiments on the injector cell,
it was observed that the injector cell resonances scale with
pipe radius. Also, the high frequency resonance seen with
the standard cell is virtually eliminated with the injector
cell due to the larger beampipe bore size for the injector
cell thus supporting a pipe mode at the high frequency
point.

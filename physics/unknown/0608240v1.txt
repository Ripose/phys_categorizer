Course elements include equal parts ofstudying physics through proven curricula and discussion of research results in the context of thePER literature.  We provide examples of the course content and structure as well asrepresentative examples of student learning in the class.PACS: 01.40Fk1.  INTRODUCTIONWith the growth of physics education research (PER) as a research field [1,2] and theongoing desire to improve teaching of introductory physics courses using reform-basedapproaches [3], there has been an opportunity to move beyond an apprenticeship model oflearning about PER toward a course-driven structure.  At the University of Maine, as part of ourMaster of Science in Teaching program, we have developed and taught two courses in IntegratedApproaches in Physics Education.  These are designed to teach physics content, PER methods,and results of investigations into student learning.  Course materials were inspired byconversations in 1999 and 2000 with Noah Finkelstein (now at University of Colorado inBoulder) as described in the companion paper in this issue.[REF to be determined in publication]Materials development was led by Michael Wittmann, with assistance from Dewey Dykstra(Boise State University), Nicole Gillespie (now at the Knowles Science Teaching Foundation),Rachel Scherr (University of Maryland), and John Thompson, who later joined the University ofMaine and has since modified the materials while teaching the courses.  Constraints, describedbelow, led to a pair of courses very different from those originally discussed by Finkelstein andWittmann, but the general purpose has remained the same:  to create an environment in whichresearch on education and teaching were both promoted and fed off each other.The goal of our courses is to build a research-based foundation for future teachers (at thehigh school and university level) as they move into teaching.  We describe the origins of thecourses and the activities that make up a typical learning cycle.  We also describe oneinstructional unit from one course in some detail.  Examples of student learning in the courseprovide insight into the types of reasoning our future teachers are capable of and how they useresearch results to guide their reasoning.  (We are engaged in a large study to examine studentA course on integrated approaches in physics educationp. 2 of 13learning of physics, pedagogy, and PER results, and plan to report extensively on these results inthe future.)Note that in this paper, we refer to “graduate students” taking the courses as GSs (thoughnot all class participants are graduate students) and we refer to students learning physics,typically the subjects of physics education research, simply as students.2.  COURSE GOALSOur objectives in designing the Integrated Approaches courses are that practicing andfuture teachers will:• learn relevant physics content knowledge at an appropriately deep level,• become familiar with “best practices” research-based instructional materials, and• gain insight into how students think about physics through education research intostudent learning and curriculum effectiveness.These objectives are consistent with those of the Master of Science in Teaching (MST)program sponsored by the University of Maine Center for Science and Mathematics EducationResearch.  We wish for participants (GSs) to learn content in courses taught using research-guided pedagogy and curricula, including hands-on, inquiry-based methods.  We offer coursesthat integrate content and methods learning.  By taking such courses, students learn how todesign and conduct science and math education research and are better able to interpret theresults of this kind of research to benefit their target population.  They apply these ideas whencarrying out their own discipline-specific education research projects as part of their master’sthesis work.The courses exist under several constraints due to the GS population targeted for theMST program.  We have designed the courses to be relevant to in-service physics teacherswanting either a deeper understanding of the physics content they are teaching, experience andexposure to physics education research, or research-based pedagogical tools.  Many from thispopulation are teaching “out of field,” and have little physics background.  Many of our MSTphysics students are transitioning from careers in science or engineering into careers ineducation, and have little pedagogical content knowledge (which we use to mean knowledgeabout how to represent the content appropriate to teaching) [4].  However, the courses are alsotaken by second- or third-year physics graduate students who are doing PER for their Ph.D. workor wishing to improve their teaching skills as they prepare for careers in academia.  Thispopulation typically has not taught outside of teaching assistantships in college courses.  Finally,we have many MST students from other science and mathematics fields.  As a result, there is agreat variety in both physics and pedagogical content knowledge among the GSs.  Thedifferences in these populations have led to interesting discussions which illustrate theimportance of both physics and pedagogical content knowledge for a complete understanding ofPER results and implementations, as well as a deeper understanding of student learning inphysics.3.  COURSE STRUCTUREThe Integrated Approaches courses are 3-credit graduate courses that meet twice a weekfor a total of 150 minutes.  We teach content knowledge, education research results, and researchmethods using a three-tiered structure.  Class time is spent approximately equally on each of thethree elements of the courses.  A research and development project is carried out in parallel,primarily outside of class time.A course on integrated approaches in physics educationp. 3 of 13A.  Course DesignWe split each course into content-based units in which we discuss leading curricula, theresearch literature related to that material, and emphasize one or two education researchmethods.  The instructional units for the individual courses are presented in tables 1 and 2.  Inaddition to the primary curricula listed in the tables, we also discuss curricula and instructionalstrategies such as Just-in-Time Teaching [22] and Physlets [23].  The two courses are designed tobe independent of each other.Physics contentCurriculum emphasizedResearch methodElectric circuitsTutorials in IntroductoryPhysics[5] and materials fromGutwill et al.[6]Analysis of free response pre-and post-test responses[7,8]KinematicsActivity-BasedTutorials[9.10], RealTimePhysics[11], and PowerfulIdeas in Physical Science[12]Free response questions,multiple-choice surveys (Testfor Understanding Graphs inKinematics (TUG-K)[13] andForce and Motion ConceptualEvaluation (FMCE)[16])Forces andNewton’s LawsTutorials in IntroductoryPhysics[5] and UMaryland“epistemologicaltutorials”[14]Multiple-choice surveys(Force Concept Inventory(FCI)[15] and FMCE[16])TABLE 1:  First semester instructional units.Physics contentCurriculum emphasizedResearch methodWave physicsand soundActivity-Based Tutorials[9,10] and Physics by Inquiry(in development)Student interviews [17],comparing multiple-choice tofree response questions [18]Work-energy andimpulse-momentumTutorials in IntroductoryPhysics [5]Student interviews [19],comparing multiple-choice tofree response questions [20]Heat andtemperatureUC Berkeley lab-tutorials andPhysics by Inquiry [21]Classroom interactions,research-based curriculumdevelopment and modificationTABLE 2:  Second semester instructional units.B.  A cycle of integrated instructionTo date, a typical cycle of instruction consists of:• pretests on the physics which will be studied, to explore the depth of understanding of ourGSs (many are weak in physics, and we need to know how best to help them);• pretests on what (introductory) students might believe about this physics, to see howgood a picture the GSs have of student reasoning about the topic;• instruction on the physics using published, research-based curricula, as listed above;A course on integrated approaches in physics educationp. 4 of 13• discussion of the research literature on the physics topic, typically based on papersdirectly related to the instructional materials, but often set up to complement and creatediscussion;• homework dealing primarily with the physics and not the pedagogy; and• a post-test on all three areas of physics, pedagogy, and research and how they intersect.We explain the various elements of our instructional cycle before giving two examples frominstruction on force and motion and on electric circuits.Having GSs work through conceptually-oriented research-based materials is a necessarycomponent of many teaching assistant preparation seminars.  By working through instructionalmaterials, GSs focus on conceptual understanding by building simple models of physicalphenomena and looking to understand the physics that is taught in a new way.  In the process,GSs with weak physics strengthen their content knowledge, while those who are stronger oftensee the physics from a new point of view.  Our course benefits the GSs by having them workthrough multiple instructional materials and subsequently participate in classroom discussionscomparing the pros and cons of different curricula.These discussions can be very helpful in teaching physics content and pedagogicalcontent knowledge.  Which of the instructional materials is best for students might depend on thecourse setting, student demographics, mathematical background of the population, and so on.Debating these issues with our GSs lets them understand the role of content knowledge,pedagogical choices teachers make, and the standards of evidence used to make choices.  Thecombination gives them a fuller picture of research-based instruction.Curriculum discussions are guided in large part by education research results on a giventopic.  Students read papers on student learning of a given physics topic, evaluation of a givencurriculum (in best cases, the one we are using to teach content knowledge at the time), and waysin which different models of student reasoning affect curriculum design by researchers anddevelopers.  Because we choose papers directly connected to the curricula we are studying,students can gain deeper insight into the origin of the instructional materials and the specificissues that curriculum developers were hoping to address.  Because developers typically useresults beyond their own work, we have a rich collection of literature to reach back to.  Weusually assign influential and well-known papers in PER, typically found in the 1998 AJPResource Letter in PER [24] or more recent results as outlined in the Forum Fall 2005Newsletter article [2].  We also include relevant pre-prints or drafts of papers associated withongoing research as a way of promoting the idea of PER as an active, growing, dynamic field.Other pedagogical issues are brought up in multiple contexts.  For example, the issue ofteaching certain topics from a purely microscopic or macroscopic perspective, or a combination,comes up in both the electric circuits [25] and the heat and temperature units [26].  These topicsappear in different semesters, which allows students taking only one semester of the course tobroach the issue, and those who take both courses to consider the issue in more than one contentarea.Research methods are introduced by readings from the PER literature, and students learnresearch skills by carrying out research projects in the course.  Skills for developing researchtools such as written questions, surveys, and interviews are developed during class time.Students also spend time in class and on homework practicing data analysis.  We give examplesbelow.  Furthermore, we have students learn about and practice clinical interview techniques inclass before doing their own interviews in their class-based research projects.  In some instances,we have students analyze video of students working in a classroom situation.  By studyingA course on integrated approaches in physics educationp. 5 of 13interactions in social groups without teaching assistants, students can gain a deeper perspectiveon learning in all elements of a course.A final part of the course is to pull together physics and pedagogical content knowledge,understanding of research methodologies, analysis skills, and research-based curriculum designinto research projects.  These research projects were originally done individually, but are nowdone in small groups (2-4 students) as either large, semester-long, projects or a series of smallerprojects, depending on the semester.  Typically, students carry out one cycle of a research anddevelopment process.  Building on a literature review, students design interview protocols andconduct individual interviews on a topic, use results to develop free-response and multiple-choice surveys to get written data, and analyze data from a relevant population to gainperspective on student reasoning about a given topic.  Using their results, they must design adraft set of narrowly focused learning materials that are appropriate to the data they havegathered, the literature, and what is known about learning in physics.4.  MEASURING LEARNING:  A UNIT ON ELECTRIC CIRCUITSWe summarize the unit on electric circuits and show data on GS learning of physics andpedagogical content knowledge in the course.  In the electric circuits unit, we emphasizematerials from the Tutorials in Introductory Physics [2] while reading papers related to thecreation of the curriculum materials [7,8] and developing skills in analyzing student writtenresponses on the associated pretest questions.Before instruction, GSs must answer the “5 bulbs” question (Figure 1) and predict whatan “ideal incorrect student” might answer in a similar situation.  We report on theirunderstanding of the physics below.  An “ideal incorrect student” response on the “5 bulbsanalysis task” would match results from the research literature and be self-consistent throughoutthe response (though, of course, students aren’t always consistent when giving wrong answers).GSs analyze typical responses by categorizing 20 anonymous student responses to the “5 bulbs”question [7,8] – before reading the research results on this question.  One class period is spent ondiscussions of different categorizations.  We report on results below.  Students work throughcurriculum pieces that begin with simple series and parallel circuits and progress through RCcircuits.  Students consider other curricula for teaching current (listed above) and discuss themerits and weaknesses of each.  Finally, they are tested on their understanding both of thephysics and the research and instruction choices that determine one’s lessons.  To showunderstanding, they must refer to the correct physics and the literature on student learning, as isappropriate.  Tests have in-class and take-home components to allow for evaluation of moretime-consuming analyses of student thinking.  In sum, we teach – and test – whether studentsthemselves learn the correct physics concepts and whether they can predict, analyze, and classifyBCDEAFIG. 1:  “5 bulbs” question.  Students must rank the brightness of each bulb.Correct response for ideal batteries and bulbs: A = D = E > B = C.A course on integrated approaches in physics educationp. 6 of 13incorrect reasoning they are likely to encounter when teaching.  (In later parts of the course, wealso ask students to suggest, design, or critique instructional materials which address typicalincorrect responses.)A.  Content knowledge:  Circuits.We have several years of GS data for the 5–bulbs pretest question.  This data wasobtained before GSs read the relevant literature on the research [7,8].  We have broken down theresults two different ways.  First, the obvious correct/incorrect distribution:  thirteen of the 23Graduate Students (57%) provided the correct ranking of the bulbs (A=D=E>B=C), with correctreasoning, and with varying levels of detail.  A second breakdown is by physics/non-physicsbackgrounds:  Of those with physics backgrounds, 12 of 15 were correct (80%); of those withnon-physics backgrounds, 1 of 8 was correct (13%).  This question was given in a similar courseat the University of Maryland, and 21 of 26 (81%) physics graduate students gave correctresponses.  In comparison, data from UW [7,8] show that, typically, only 15% of students answerthe question correctly, even after instruction.  Our non-physics GSs are typical of a largerpopulation of students.  Clearly non-physics GSs who may very well teach this simple physicstopic in the future need help learning the physics.  We can also not assume that all physics GSsknow the material.  Common incorrect responses are consistent with introductory physics studentanswers (including “current used up” and “battery provides constant current” answers).  On post-tests, GSs typically perform at the 100% level for the entire population on certain content-basedquestions that are more difficult than the 5-bulbs question.  See figure 2 for an example of a post-test question [27].ABDECFGQuestionAttempt to decide bulb brightnessin the circuit by reasoning on thebasis of current and also byreasoning on the basis of voltage.Which method is better suited foranalyzing the circuit?  Explain.FIG 2.  Representative post-test question for the ElectricCircuits unit administered to GSs.A course on integrated approaches in physics educationp. 7 of 13B.  Example research method:  Analyzing pretests.We have had 23 GSs do the “5 bulbs analysis task,” described above.  They have used at least 10different analysis methods.  What fascinates us is the natural language they bring to the problembefore receiving training in analysis and before discussing analysis methods with each other.Broad categories include whether students’ wrong answers are measured, or whether theanalyzer attends to what students are doing well.  Most GSs focus on incorrect answers, as theyhave been implicitly trained to do through their own academic careers.  Few emphasize valuableelements of student responses.  More subtle issues include whether GSs organize the analysisalong individual responses (of which there are many, and nearly no repeats) or try to encodelikely reasoning models into the models.  The former is ungainly, while the latter incorporatesoften unquestioned theoretical orientations and assumptions at the first step of analysis.  Finally,we observe that our students typically only use one analysis method, rather than considering asingle data from multiple perspectives.  Many unspoken assumptions must be stated andquestioned in the ensuing class discussion of the analysis.  In summary, our GSs are novices atanalysis – not naïve, but definitely inexperienced.  The Integrated Approaches courses aredesigned to help GSs understand their unquestioned assumptions about students, why they valuecorrect elements of reasoning so little, and how they assume that students construct theirknowledge of physics.C.  Understanding pedagogy:  Analyzing the intent of questions.In one electric circuits post-test question, the GSs were given 5 students’ responses to anexpanded 5-bulbs question.  The first two parts of the modified question were the same as infigure 1.  A third question was added to this pretest, based on a personal communication fromBradley S. Ambrose at Grand Valley State University.  It asked the students to rank the currentsthrough the battery for the three circuits in the figure.  It should be noted that the GSs had neverseen the third pretest question before this point in the semester, though the general issue hadbeen discussed in class.  The GSs were asked to analyze the student ranking and reasoning foreach question independently; they were then asked to discuss the purpose of the third question –what insight could it give into students’ reasoning?  We have anonymous data from the threequestion analysis asked on take-home exams using this modifications.  (GSs also had to analyzestudent responses to each question and discuss consistency of student responses as part of thetake-home test.)GS responses illustrate the types of learning we wish them to attain.  A biology studentwith little background in physics stated:[The current question] gives insight into whether or not the students truly considerthe battery as a constant current source.  The correct ranking of B and C beingequal, but dimmer than A because current is “shared” might not fully bring forththe idea of the battery as a constant current source.  This is shown in the answersof Student 5.  …  Although Student 1 shows a similar idea in question 1 that thebattery is a constant current source and doesn’t state it explicitly, the answer givento question 2 confirms the model.Note that the student compares two student responses to illustrate the value of the question ingiving a more complete interpretation of student thinking.  A physics student (familiar withTutorials but not the unit on circuits) stated:[The current question] is useful in prying reasoning from the students.  By askingwhat is happening at the battery, it is far easier to elicit a clear “constant current”A course on integrated approaches in physics educationp. 8 of 13model, if that is indeed a model which the student uses.  It also allows us todiscover if a student is thinking holistically or piece-wise, by comparing what thestudent believes is going on in the battery to … the rest of the circuit.In this response, the difference between holistic or piece-wise analysis of the circuit is pointedout, as described in the literature [7, 8].  In both examples, we find that students after instructionare able to carefully interpret student reasoning in a way that is useful for interpreting curriculummaterials and facilitation of student learning.We have only discussed a small subset of the data we have, not all of which has beenanalyzed.  In our teaching, we seek to triangulate between different data sources which include:classroom video of students throughout an entire semester; written pre- and post-tests on contentunderstanding; written pre- and post-tests on pedagogical content, e.g., GSs’ responses of whatthey feel might be the most common incorrect responses on pretests, standardized surveys, andexamination questions; and the GS mini-group project materials, including pretests, analysis, andcurriculum.  Data exist for all units and continue to be gathered.  We will report on results infuture publications.5.  INSTRUCTIONAL UNIT: MOTION AND FORCEWe teach motion and force after we teach electric circuits because we have found thatGSs are more likely to respond to the PER content of circuits than to forces.  Once they areattuned to discussing PER results, it is easier to return to earlier topics from typical introductoryphysics courses.A.  Summary of activitiesThe unit on motion and force strongly emphasizes the research methods associated withstandardized tests such as the Test for Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K) [13], ForceConcept Inventory (FCI) [15], and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE) [16].  TheGSs, many very familiar with the actual physics, are typically less familiar with research intostudent learning of the topic.  The GSs read papers by Trowbridge and McDermott [28,29],Minstrell [30], Reif and Allen [31], diSessa [32], Brown and Clement [33], Dykstra [34,35], andHammer and Elby [36].  Curricula that are studied include the Activity-Based Tutorial onvelocity, using motion sensors [9], Just-in-Time Teaching [22] and Physlets [23], Powerful Ideasin Physics Science [12], Tutorials in Introductory Physics [5], RealTime Physics labs [11], aswell as an example of a “refining intuitions” tutorial from Elby[36].  While studying thesematerials, GSs are engaged in mini-group projects in which they develop free-response andmultiple-choice questions (on the same topic), administer the questions to students, analyze theresults, and compare data from the two question formats.  Finally, they must answer the FCI andthe FMCE to the best of their ability and as they would expect an ideal, incorrect student toanswer.  They must also justify the “ideal, incorrect” responses.In summary, GSs in the units on motion and force study physics content pedagogiesdeveloped based on research, read the associated research literature, and develop their ownresearch instruments.  Many opportunities for growth in physics and pedagogical contentknowledge are possible.B.  The interplay of content and pedagogical content knowledgeInstruction on Newton’s laws provides many examples for comparing instructionalchoices.  We base our discussions on an understanding of physics and of pedagogy, includingA course on integrated approaches in physics educationp. 9 of 13how a curriculum presents the physics and what population is best matched to it.  We give onlyone example, though there are several in this unit, alone.  When first presenting Newton’sSecond Law, RealTime Physics (RTP) [11] uses dynamic situations with a single horizontal forcewhile Tutorials in Introductory Physics (TiIP) [5] uses static situations with many forces actingat once.In RTP, students first study how a single force causes an acceleration, a concept which initself is often difficult to understand.  Students start with observations of low friction cartsspeeding up, relate that change in speed to the mass hanging from the pulley, account for theratio of cart mass to acceleration by defining the force acting on the cart, and then considercompeting forces (such as from two different fans on a single cart) as well as the variation ofbalancing forces leading to no motion.In TiIP, students begin by considering many types of forces acting on a single, stationaryobject on which many forces are acting.  They learn to distinguish between contact and non-contact forces, compare systems in horizontal and vertical systems, and generally use a staticsituation to derive the idea of Newton’s Second Law.  Student learning is very differentcompared to RTP.  Students immediately think of balancing forces and must incorporate ideasrelated to Newton’s Third Law much sooner.  During the tutorial, there is no discussion ofobjects in motion, but horizontal and vertical cases (with multiple objects and many differentkinds of forces being exerted).  Later, in the homework, students must consider motion and theeffects of changes in motion on each of the different types of forces.The RTP and the TiIP approach differ in striking ways, yet both are shown to be effectivein teaching Newton’s Laws.  We guide a discussion among the GSs on the possibly largedifferences in what and how students understand Newton’s Laws after using each curriculum.C.  Teaching of education researchWe help our GSs learn to create, administer, and analyze results from a variety ofresearch tools common to PER.  For example, when analyzing the TUG-K [13] or the FMCE[16], students are given data tables with student responses and asked to build models of studentreasoning about specific physics content.  An example question from an examination is shown inFigure 3.In other questions, we have asked students to decide why certain questions are notanalyzed on the FMCE [37], though they are nearly identical to others that are analyzed.  Thepurpose is to help the GSs practice and understand the ways in which standardized tests areuseful when analyzed in part, rather than analyzed as a whole (such as with a normalized gain).Results are encouraging, in that students accurately connect student reasoning to curricula andthe research literature in which results are discussed.6.  DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have discussed two elements of our courses in Integrated Approaches inPhysics Education.  These two examples summarize a part of the first semester content.  Asimilar course structure is used in our second semester, while emphasizing different content andresearch methods.  The two semesters together are designed to teach a conceptual perspective ofphysics content, develop the basic skills for education research methods, and bring aboutfamiliarity with the research-based curricula and the research literature that supports theireffectiveness in the classroom.A course on integrated approaches in physics educationp. 10 of 13FIG. 3.  Example FMCE analysis question, given on the take-home portion of a midtermexamination.  Data are from actual student responses.The courses we describe have been firmly placed within the curriculum for the recentlycreated Master of Science in Teaching program at the University of Maine.  There is strongsupport for these courses within the Center and the Department of Physics and Astronomy; asimilar course structure exists in a course on Earth Systems Science Education Research [38].  Atthe same time, the Integrated Approaches courses have been modified based on situationalconstraints.  The largest change is that the courses were initially envisioned as a two-semestersequence but were altered to be two stand-alone courses due to the many interdisciplinarycourses taken by MST students.  The courses will continue to be modified in order to meet theneeds of the students taking the courses, and to reflect the state of the field of PER.  For example,in the electric circuits unit in the future, we will include a discussion of the impact of simulationsin conjunction with the materials from the Tutorials in Introductory Physics, as reported byresearchers at the University of Colorado.[39]  This brings in new technologies and adds to thediscussion of the macroscopic/microscopic pedagogy issue.Because we have several different student populations, it is possible to differentiatebetween them when considering the learning of physics and pedagogical content knowledge.  Wefind that most physics GSs enter the course with good conceptual knowledge, but that most ofthe non-physics GSs in the course need help in developing their physics understanding.  We findthat most of the GSs are novices in analyzing education research data from written, free-responseConsider 9 questions taken from the Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation (FMCE, questions8–13 and 27–29).

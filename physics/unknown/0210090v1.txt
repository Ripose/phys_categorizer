Abstract 

The  dependence  of  electron  transfer  rates  and  yields  in  bridged  molecular  systems  on 

the bridge length, and the dependence of the zero-bias conduction of molecular wires on 

wire  length  are  discussed.  Both  phenomena  are  controlled  by  tunneling  across  the 

molecular  bridge  and  are  consequently  expected  to  show  exponential  decrease  with 

bridge  length  that  is  indeed  often  observed.  Deviations  from  this  exponential 

dependence  for  long  bridges,  in  particular  a  crossover  to  a  very  weak  dependence  on 

bridge  length  were  recently  observed  experimentally  and  discussed  theoretically  in 

terms  of  thermal  relaxation  and  dephasing  on  the  bridge.  Here  we  discuss  two  other 

factors that potentially affect the bridge length dependence of these phenomena.  First, 

in  experiments  initiated  by  an  initial  preparation  of  a  non-stationary  "donor"  state the 

initial  energy  is  not  well  defined.  A  small  contribution  from  initially  populated 

eigenstates that are of mostly bridge-level character may dominate transmission for long 

bridges,  resulting  in  weak  or  no  bridge-length  dependence.  Secondly,  in  steady  state 

experiments  the  distribution  of  initial  states  (for example  the  Fermi  distribution  at the 

electrodes 

in  conduction  experiments)  will  cause  deviations  from  exponential 

dependence on wire length because even a small population in higher energy states will 

dominate  the transmission  through  long  wires.  For the  first  scenario  we  show that the 

crossover behavior observed for electron transfer in DNA between G and GGG species 

separated by AT chains can be largely reproduced just by initial state effects.

1. Introduction 

 
The  distance  dependence  of  electron  transfer  rates  and  yields  is  obviously  an 
important attribute of the process.1 The tunneling nature of this transfer is manifested in 

a characteristic exponentially decreasing behavior with increasing bridge length. Figure 

1  shows  a  well-known  simple  model  for  this  phenomenon.  In  Figure  1a  the  electron 

transfer  takes  place  between  donor  (D)  and  acceptor  (A)  species  through  a  molecular 

bridge B represented by a set of N consecutive levels with nearest-neighbor coupling. In 

Figure 1b the donor and acceptor are replaced by two metal electrodes, represented by 

dense  manifolds  of  (quasi-free)  electron  states.  Both  models  are  characterized  by  the 

bridge  length  N,  the  coupling  V  of  the  first  and  last  bridge  levels  to  the  donor  and 

acceptor  (or  the  leads)  states,  respectively,  the  bridge  inter-level  coupling  VB  and  the 

electronic  energy  gap 

EB  between  the  bridge  energy 

B  and  the  injection  energy  (i.e. 

the donor energy in the electron-transfer system and the Fermi energy in the conduction 

case). For simplicity we take same  nearest neighbor couplings  in the  bridge and  same 

couplings  between  the  bridge  and  the  donor/acceptor  species,  and  also  take  the  same 

donor and acceptor energies,  D

A

 and a single  bridge energy. The conclusions we 

reach  below  do  not  depend  on  these  simplifications.  The  Hamiltonian  of  the  DBA 

system is

Such exponential  length dependence qualifies a  molecular wire as an  insulator. 

In  contrast,  coherent  transfer  at  resonance  (

0

)  does  not  depend  on  N,  while

classical conducting behavior shows an Ohmic length dependence of the conduction g,

.  Classical  conducting  behavior  occurs  when  dephasing  interactions  dominate

diffusive, transfer.1

In  addition  to  these  coherent  and  incoherent  transfer  limits,  interesting 

intermediate cases have been discussed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. 

These cases show a crossover from the exponential N dependence that characterizes off-

resonance  coherent  transfer,  to  a  behavior  described  by  (cid:0)

A BN (cid:2)

  with  A  and  B

constants.  In  phenomenological  approaches  this  behavior  is  accounted  for  by  a 

superposition of two processes, coherent tunneling that dominates the transfer for small 

N  and  drops  exponentially  as  N  increases  and  activation  onto  the  bridge  followed  by 
incoherent hops along it.3,4 The constant A is related to the thermal activation time, and 

for  intermediate  values of  N  it  may  happen that  A

BN

  and that the transfer rate or 

yield  beyond  the  crossover  from  the  exponential  behavior  may  appear  practically 

independent of the bridge length. (A residual exponential drop may be imposed on this 

kinetic regime if the electron is exposed to additional loss processes on the bridge (for 

example electron capture by a surrounding solvent, e.g. water).  In the limit of large N 
the transfer (or conduction) assumes the Ohmic, N-1 behavior. Table 1 summarizes these 

processes.

More rigorous treatments of electron transfer5,6 show that the different processes 

displayed  in Table 1 do not contribute to the overall transmission  in  a simple additive 

way,  however  the  qualitative  behavior  is  the  same  and  the  insight  obtained  from  the 

qualitative  picture  remains  useful.  These  theoretical  treatments  incorporate  into  the 

quantum  dynamics  implied  by  the  Hamiltonian  (1)  additional  interactions  with  the

thermal  environment.  This  results  in  activation  and  dephasing  transitions  that,  in  the 

limit of strong thermal interactions, leads to the incoherent hopping dynamics. 

Recent  experimental  observations  of  the  crossover  behavior  described  above 

lend  support  for  this  thermal  mechanism.  However,  here  we  point  out  that  crossover 

from  exponential  decrease  with  bridge  length  to a  weak  length  dependence  may  arise 

also from other physical origins. In the present paper we examine two such possibilities: 

(a) For processes that are initiated by a sudden preparation of the initial donor state the 

actual  initial  energy  is  not  well  defined  because  this  state  is  not  an  eigenstate  of  the 

DBA Hamiltonian. Some (small) population must be placed on eigenstates of the DBA 

systems  that  are  delocalized  on  the  bridge.  The  probability  that  this  population  is 

detected on the other side of the bridge does not depend on the bridge length. For long 

enough bridge this population can dominate the observed transfer. 

(b)  For  processes  in  which  thermal  relaxation  on  the  donor  and  acceptor  sites  is  fast 

while that on the bridge can be disregarded (an example for this situation is a molecule 

suspended in vacuum between two metal leads) the observed transfer rate, flux or yield 

should be averaged over the initial thermal energy distribution. For higher energies the 

dependence  on  bridge  length  is  weaker  and  for  energies  in  resonance  with  the  bridge 

levels  it disappears. For increasing  bridge  length  the contribution of higher energies  is 

more  important.  This  implies  a  deviation  from  the  exponential  behavior  (2)  that  was 

obtained for a given  (cid:0) EB. 

 

In  the  following  sections  we  examine  the  dependence  on  bridge  length  arising 

under these two scenarios that do not involve thermal relaxation on the bridge. We find 

that the first possibility leads to crossover from exponential to length independence that 

is  similar  to  that  predicted  by  the  thermal  relaxation  model.  In  fact  we  show  that  the 
experimental  results  of  Giese  and  coworkers7 on  the  distance  dependence  of  electron-

transfer in DNA can be fitted into this scenario. In the second case that we examine for 

the  conduction  problem  we  find  at  room  temperature  marked  deviations  from 

exponential  behavior,  however  no  sharp  crossover  behavior.  It  is  important  to 

emphasize  that  it  is  in  principle  possible  to  distinguish  experimentally  between  these 

different  effects  on  the  bridge  length  dependence  of  electron  transfer  and  conduction. 

We return to this point in the conclusion section.

2. Electron transfer following a sudden initial preparation of the donor state 

In what follows we take 

D

A

0

. We focus on the process that follows an 

initial population of the state D  (or 0). The actual process of electron transfer between 

donor  and  acceptor  sites  involves  nuclear  reorganization  at  these  sites.  This 

reorganization  is  the  principal  source  of  irreversibility  in  this  process  where  other 

sources may arise from radiative or non-radiative decay of the donor and acceptor states 

or from electron capture from the bridge. Here we will consider a simpler model where 

decay  of  donor  and  acceptor  states  as  well  as  possible  decay  of  bridge  states  is 

incorporated  by  assigning  complex  values  with  negative  imaginary  parts  to  the 

corresponding 

energies

For  any  bridge-length  N,  following  diagonalization  of  the  Hamiltonian  H  the 

yield YA and the yields ratio R are easily evaluated. It is also of interest to consider the 

case where rapid dephasing due to environmental interactions destroys all coherences in 

the eigenstates representation of the system's density matrix on a time scale fast relative 

to the electron transfer. In this case, following the preparation of the donor state, the t=0

Finally,  it  is  also  of  interest  to  examine  the  implication  of  a  common

replacing  the  N+2  levels  description  of  the  bridge  assisted  electron  transfer  by  a  two

coupling  determined  by  their  coupling  to  the  bridge  and  by  the  bridge  electronic 
properties.  The  rational  behind  this  approximation2  is  that  in  the  weak  coupling  limit 

considered the two lowest eigenenergies (or in  fact their real  parts) are well  separated

states, and their  interstate dynamics can  be described  in the reduced representations of 

just  these  two  eigenstates.  The  effective  coupling  is  often  identified  with  half  the 

splitting  between  the  corresponding  eigenvalues.  Applying  this  approximation  to  the

initial distributions in the complete (N+2)-state calculation. (b) Such a crossover is not 

obtained  in  the  super-exchange  approximation  where  the  contribution  of  only  the  two 

lowest eigenstates to the transfer calculation is taken into account. (c) Rapid dephasing 

of the  initial  distribution (Fig. 4)  seems to have a relatively  weak effect on the  length 

dependence.  The  length  dependence  of  the  yield  ratio  is  qualitatively  similar  in  the 

coherent and  incoherent cases;  in  fact  it  is  almost the same  for the parameters shown. 

(d) For some choice of parameters the yield ratio may oscillate as a function of bridge 

length (Fig. 3). This interesting interference behavior will be probably erased in realistic 

situations because of dephasing interactions and inhomogeneous broadening effects.

The origin of the non-exponential behavior seen in Figs. 3 and 4 is the fact that 

for an initially prepared donor state is not an eigenstates of the system, the initial energy 

is  not  well  defined  and  a  small  amount  of  population  in  eigenstates  dominated  by  the 

bridge  may  be  initially  excited.  Next  we  consider  a  different  situation  in  which  the 

energy is well defined. 

3. Electron transmission in a scattering-type process 

A  related  but  different  experimental  setup  in  which  electron  transmission  at  a 

given  energy  can  be  monitored  as  a  function  of  bridge  length  is  a  scattering-type 

experiment in which an electron is incident at a given energy on the DBA system from, 

say, the donor side. In this case the energy is well defined by the incoming state. As an 
example consider the experiment9 in which electrons were injected into N-hexane films 

adsorbed  on  a  polycrystaline  Pt  foil  at  energies  below  the  bottom  of  the  N-hexane  

conduction band (~0.8eV). The role of bridge states is here assumed by impurity states 

in the hydrocarbon band gap. The energy is determined by the incident electron beam. 

Another  situation  is  depicted  in  Fig.  1b,  where  the  zero  temperature,  zero  bias 

conduction  between  the  left  (L)  and  right  (R)  electrodes  is  given  by  the  Landauer 

formula

a  scattering  theory  result,  is  the  transmission  probability  (summed  over  all  initial  and 

final  channels)  for  an  electron  incident  from  the  (say)  left  electrode  at  energy  E  to 

emerge on the right. The equivalent finite temperature result reads

In what follows we limit ourselves for simplicity to the situation that state 1 only 

of the bridge is coupled to the left lead, and state N only is coupled to the right lead. The 
transmission probability at energy E is then given by10,11

depends  exponentially  on  the  bridge  length  except  in  what  is  essentially  a  resonance 

situation.  The  reason  for  the  different  conclusion  obtained  in  the  previous  section  is 

evident.  In  Section  2  we  have  considered  an  initially  prepared  zero  order  ("donor") 

state, where by definition the energy was not well defined. The (small) initial population 

of eigenstates dominated by the bridge is what gave rise to the crossover from the off-

resonance  component  that  dominates  the  short  bridge  transfer  to  the  on-resonance 

component  that  remains  for  long  bridges.  Here  the  energy  is  well  defined  and  in  off-

resonance situations the dependence on bridge length is purely exponential decay. The 

situation is different at finite temperatures, where different injection energies contribute 

according  to  Eq.  (13).  Figure  5  shows  the  resulting  behavior  at  room  temperature.  A 

marked  deviation  from  the  exponential  behavior  obtained  at  T=0  is  seen,  however  in 

marked  contrast  to  the  situation  discussed  in  Section  2,  or  to  the  case  that  involves

To  end  this  section  we  note  that  the  dependence  on  bridge  length  in  these 

systems will obviously depend also on the applied potential bias. It will be of interest to 

study this issue in more detail when experimental data becomes available. 

4. Discussion and conclusions 

The  dependence  of  bridge  assisted  electron  transfer  on  the  molecular  bridge 

length  and  the  dependence  of  molecular  wire  conduction  on  the  wire  length  are 

obviously  interesting  and  important  attributes  of  these  processes.  In  particular  the 

crossover  from  exponential  to  very  weak  length  dependence  for  increasing  bridge 

lengths has attracted much attention recently, and was rationalized by thermal relaxation 

and dephasing processes in the bridge. In the present paper we have identified two other 

factors  that  affect  the  bridge  length  dependence.  Both  are  related  to  the  fact  that  the 

injection energy is an important parameter in this consideration.  

The  first  factor  (see  Figs.  3  and  4)  arises  not  from  the  physical  nature  of  the 

system  but  from  the  choice  of  experimental  setup  and  experimental  observable.  In  an 

experiment characterized by a sudden (on the experimental timescale) preparation of the

initial  zero  order  ("donor")  state  the  energy  is  not  well  defined,  some  eigenstates 

dominated  by  the  bridge  are  also  excited  (viewed  as  a  tunneling  process,  these  are 

"above  barrier"  states),  and  their  contribution  to  the  transmission  may  dominate  the 

electron  transfer  for  long  bridges.  The  relative  importance  of  this  contribution  to  the 

observed  electron transfer depends of course on the  system parameters. In  fact, with  a 

reasonable choice of parameters this model can successfully reproduce the experimental 
results of Giese et al.7  for hole transfer  in DNA duplexes consisting of Guanine donor 

and acceptor states separated by Adenine-Thymine bridges of varying lengths. In Ref. 7 

the yield ratio of the reaction

for 

3N (cid:5)

 and it converges to a value of  2.5 0.5

 for 

N (cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:8)

. In the corresponding 

model given by the Hamiltonian DBAH

 (Eq. 1) the hole-donor state of  G (cid:10) corresponds to 

state  0 , the hole-acceptor state of  (

GGG (cid:11)
)

  is the state 

1N (cid:12)

, and the  intermediate 

Adenine-hole  A(cid:13) states  are  represented  by  the  bridge  states 

(cid:15)l

.  We  apply  the 

incoherent model discussed in Section 2 so that the yield ratio is modeled by incF , since 

the  nature  of  the  preparation  process  in  Ref.  7  suggests  rapid  loss  of  electronic 

coherence. Using (as in figures 3 and 4) the parameters of Bixon and Jortner4 for 

BE(cid:16)

, 

V   and 

BV   it  is  possible  to  fit  the  experimental  data  of  Giese  et  al  by  setting

make an exhaustive search for the best fitting parameters as our main purpose here is to 

demonstrate  the  potential  applicability  of  the  suggested  model.  Also,  it  should  be 

emphasized  that  this  observation  by  no  means  implies  that  the  present  model  is  the 

correct  interpretation  of  this  experiment,  only  that  it  may  offer  a  possible  alternative. 

Different mechanisms may coexist, as discussed below.

Note that the dominance of bridge-like eigenstates in the electron transfer in the 

long bridge limit is in fact a failure of the super-exchange model. This observation has 

been  made  for  time–dependent  Hamiltonians

  12,13.  For  a  time-dependent 

system  where  the  donor  and  acceptor  are  off-resonant  to  the  bridge  at  all  times,  the 

eigenstates {

} at each time t will have an eigenspectrum  similar to figure 2. Two 

eigenstates

time  t  is  the  partial  sum    over

t

.  For  small  bridge  lengths  the  maximum 

amplitude  of 

AP t decays  exponentially  with  increasing  bridge  length  because  the 

superexchange  contribution  to  the  probability  dominates  the  sum.  At  large  bridge 

lengths  superexchange  is  negligible  and  the  other  eigenstates  mainly  contribute  to 

AP t

.  In  this  situation  the  maximum  amplitude  of 

AP t decays  very  slowly  with 

increasing  bridge  length.  This  behavior  has  been  observed  in  molecular-dynamics 
simulations of fluctuating protein donor-bridge-acceptor systems.13  

 

The  first  factor  discussed  above  plays  a  potential  role  in  transient  experiments 

following an initial state preparation. The second factor is associated with initial thermal 

distributions  and  is  potentially  important  also  in  steady  state  experiments  and  follows 

from the simple observation that in most experimental situations the initial distribution 

of "donor states" is not limited to a single energy even in a long time experiment where 

the  energy  can  in  principle  be  well  defined.  In  molecular  conduction  the  initial 

distribution  is  determined  by  the  temperature  and  consequently  so  is  the  resulting 

dependence on wire length (Fig. 5).  

 

It  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  in  realistic  systems,  effects  of  initial  thermal 

distribution or of sudden preparation of the initial distribution may coexist with thermal 

relaxation effects. The resulting  bridge  length dependence will reflect the combination 

of these  factors. Furthermore, in  most experimental system changing the bridge  length 

dependence  may  affect  the  bridge  electronic  structure  (within  the  simple  model 

considered  here  -  the  parameters  VB  and  (cid:5) EB).  Further  experimental  studies  of  bridge 

length dependence of electron transfer and transmission will provide a desirable tool in 

elucidating the mechanism of these processes.

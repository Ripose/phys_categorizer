Abstract

We  present  an  experimental  observation  on  particles  adsorbed  to  a  whispering  gallery

mode  (WGM)  optical  resonator  produced  from  a  glass  sphere  @ 100  m m  in  radius.  For

spherical  adsorbates  of  radius  a  @ 100  nm  (meso-optic,  2p a/l  ~1) we  find  a  striking

nonlinear  dependence  of  the  induced  wavelength  shift  on  the  adsorbed  particle  density,

whereas  for  Rayleigh  particles  with  dimensions  much  smaller  than  the  infrared

wavelength  the  dependence  is  linear  with  particle  density.  An  explanation  of  the

anomalous effect based on optical coupling between meso-optic adsorbates is suggested.

Ever  since  the  pioneering  work  on  high  Q  whispering  gallery  resonances  in

spherical  micrometer  sized  resonators  by  Ashkin  and  Didzkic  [1]  there  have  been  a

plethora of articles [2] which have extended the measured “ultimate Q” [3] to ~1010. The

interest in such resonators has been fueled by a diversity of areas from studies of strong

coupling  in  quantum  electrodynamics  [4]  to  ultra-sensitive  bio-sensing  [5].  The  latter

interest,  which  has  produced  a  record  sensitivity,  depends  on  the  shift  in  resonance

frequency  due  to  the  perturbation  by  adsorbed  nanoparticles  (i.e.  protein  molecules,

DNA, etc.).

The  recent  experiments  on  DNA  hybridization  [6]  and  specific  protein

interactions [5] deal with adsorbates ~10 nm in size for which a first order perturbation

theory  of  Rayleigh  scattering  has  successfully  been  applied  [7,  8].  Herein  we  present

experiments on adsorbates in transition toward Mie sizes (meso-optic, size ~100 nm) and

find an anomalous enhancement over the first order theory. In addition, our results have a

fundamentally  different  form.  Although  the  Rayleigh  theory  predicts  a  resonant

wavelength  shift  in  proportion  to  surface  density,  with  meso-optic  adsorbates  the  effect

has  a  predominant  density  squared  component.  It  appears  that  the  new  phenomenon  is

due to resonantly enhanced coupling between the adsorbed particles.

In  what  follows  we  briefly  describe  our  experimental  approach,  present  the

anomalous results on meso-optical particles and outline a theoretical approach based on

the multiple scattering of the WGM by adsorbed particles.

In our experiments we use a microsphere cavity as an ideal optical resonator for

WGMs. Smaller particles can be bound to such a cavity. Such adsorbed particles perturb

the WGM by interaction with the associated evanescent field. We use highly polarizable

polystyrene spheres (called nanospheres) with a refractive index of n = 1.59 of varying

size to perturb the WGM (Fig.1).

We excite WGMs inside the silica microsphere cavity (n = 1.46) of typical radius

R = 110 m m by evanescent coupling to a single mode fiber [9] which is eroded into its

core by etching with hydrofluoric acid. [10]. The microspheres are made by melting the

tip of a single mode fiber in a butane/nitrous oxide flame [11]. The fabricated sphere is

mounted on a xyz stage and positioned in mechanical contact with the eroded fiber core,

to  enable  evanescent  coupling.  Coherent  light  is  transmitted  through  the  single  mode

fiber from a current tunable distributed feedback laser operating at a nominal wavelength

l  = 1312 nm. The fiber-transmitted intensity is detected by a photodetector at the other

fiber end. We identify the resonance wavelength from the minima of a Lorentzian-shaped

dip  in  the  transmission  spectrum  [12].  This  microsphere-fiber  system  is  operated  in  an

aqueous  environment  (salted  phosphate  buffer  PBS,  pH  7.4)  with  a  Q  ~2  x  106.  The

resonance  wavelength  is  determined  with  a  precision  ~1/50th  of  the  linewidth  from  a

parabolic minimum fit of the resonance dip. A suspension of nanospheres of a given size

is  then  injected  into  the  liquid  filled  sample  cell  whereupon  the  nanospheres  diffuse  to

and stably adsorb on the surface of the microsphere cavity. The resonant wavelength vs.

nanosphere surface density is continually monitored from the point of injection.

We  use  fluorescent,  carboxylated  polystyrene  nanospheres 

to  study 

the

perturbative effect. The sample cell is examined with a standard fluorescence microscope

equipped with a Xenon lamp and fluorescent filter set. The surface density of adsorbed

yellow-green  fluorescent  nanospheres  (Molecular  Probes)  is  determined  from  an  image

taken  with  a  cooled  CCD  camera.  We  plot  the  recorded  wavelength  shift  versus  the

nanosphere surface density.

For nanospheres of meso-optical size ~100 nm radius we observe an anomalous

shift of the resonant line (Fig. 2). The wavelength shift is much larger than expected from

our  first  order  perturbation  theory  developed  for  Rayleigh  particles.  Furthermore,  we

observe  a  pronounced  nonlinear  dependence  of  the  resonant  line  shift  with  nanosphere

surface  density 

.  This  effect  is  not  seen  for  nanospheres  of  radii  ~50  nm  or  smaller

where  the  Rayleigh  theory  [7]  applies.  The  mean  field  approximation  to  multiple

scattering of nanospheres gives rise to the linear scattering, which is represented in Fig.2

by  a  solid  line  for  the  Rayleigh  limit  and  by  the  dashed  line  when  the  evanescent  field

penetration depth is taken into account.

For  the  larger  nanospheres  the  theoretical  explanation  of  the  observed  effect  is

challenging  because  of  its  departure  from  the  Rayleigh  regime  and  the  relatively  large

polarizability  of  the  adsorbates.  A  model  for  this  strong  nonlinear  dependence  of  the

resonant  wavelength  shift  on  the  density  of  meso-optic  adsorbates  will  be  constructed

below.

The  electromagnetic  field  induced  in  the  cavity  and  the  solution  by  the  eroded

optical  fiber 

is  determined  by 

the  macroscopic  Maxwell  equations  with  an

  represents  the  order  of  the

Born  approximation.  The  power  expansion  in  nanosphere  surface  density  s

  takes  into

We  suspect  that  the  pairing  effect  depicted  in  Fig.3  accounts  for  the  coupling

between two nanospheres. Mutual scattering of WGMs by the nanospheres produces the

major  contribution  to  the  observed  nonlinearity  and  we  have  estimated  its  magnitude

within  the  framework  of  the  Born  approximation.  The  leading  order  diagram  of  the

pairing potential is shown in the inset of Fig.3, where a solid line is associated with a free

We  found  that  the  coefficients  C  can  be  approximated  by  a  function  of

a

and  the  line-shift  is  inversely  proportional  to  R.  This  is  consistent  with  the  observed

scaling  behavior  of  the  line-shift  with  the  cavity  radius.  The  uncertainties  behind  this

estimate stem from the lack of a clear-cut separation between WGMs and non-resonance

modes.  From  our  data  measured  for  nansopheres  of  radius  a  =  105  nm  at  two  different

cavity sizes (R = 110 m m and 200 m m) we determine the coupling coefficient C  ¨

 2500.

A robust calculation of the nonlinearity is under way, which will involve pairing effect as

well as weak localization.

Figure legends

Figure  1:  A  –  The  silica  microsphere  cavity  is  evanescently  coupled  to  an  etch-eroded

single mode optical fiber operated at l =  1.3 m m wavelength. The wavelength is scanned

by  a  current  tunable  laser  source.  Cavity  resonances  are  detected  as  Lorentzian-shaped

dips in the transmission spectrum recorded by the photodetector at the fiber end. B - The

microsphere-fiber  contact  is  located  in  a  sample  cell  filled  with  a  dilute,  aqueous

suspension  of  nanospheres.  Nanosphere  particles  adsorbing  to  the  microsphere  cavity

cause a red-shift of the resonant line. The surface density of the fluorescent particles is

determined  from  an  image  acquired  with  a  fluorescence  microscope.  We  relate  the

surface density with the recorded wavelength shift.

Figure 2: Anomalous resonance wavelength shift produced by meso-optical polystyrene

nanospheres of a = 105 nm radius. This nonlinear effect has a quadratic dependence on

the surface density. The data (dots) is also plotted for nanospheres of a = 50 nm radius

which  follow  the  linear  mean  field  theory  for  this  Rayleigh  limit.  The  graph  shows  the

predictions  of  this  theory  for  both  nansophere  sizes  (solid  lines).  Furthermore  the

Rayleigh  theory  is  corrected  for  the  evanescent  field  penetration  depth  (dashed  lines).

The onset of the nonlinear effect for nanospheres larger than 50 nm in radius marks the

transition between the Rayleigh and Mie regime.

Figure 3: Multiple scattering theory explains the nonlinear effect as a pairwise coupling

between  surface  adsorbed  nanospheres.  The  equatorial  microsphere  cavity  resonance

(WGM,  quantum  numbers  n  and  l)  excites  a  nearby  bound  nanosphere.  This  first

nanosphere  then  interacts  with  a  second  nanosphere  via  scattered  light  (n1l1  and  n1

’l1)

causing  a  nonlinear  perturbation  of  the  resonance  wavelength.  The  inset  shows  the

Feynman-like  diagram  explaining  the  pairing  effect,  which  is  quadratic  in  nanosphere

surface  density.  The  microsphere  is  of  typical  radius  R ¨ 100  m m,  the  nanospheres

causing the anomalous wavelength shift are of typical radius a  ¨ 100 nm.

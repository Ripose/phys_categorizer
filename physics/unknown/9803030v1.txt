Abstract

The Lee, Oehme and Yang (LOY) theory of time evolution in
two state subspace of states of the complete system is discussed.
Some inconsistencies in assumptions and approximations used in the
standard derivation of the LOY eﬀective Hamiltonian, HLOY , gov-
ernig this time evolution are found. Eliminating these inconsistecies
and using the LOY method, approximate formulae for the eﬀective
Hamiltonian,Hk, governing the time evolution in this subspace (im-
proving those obtained by LOY) are derived. It is found, in contradis-
tinction to the standard LOY result, that in the case of neutral kaons
(< K0|Hk|K0 > − < K0|Hk|K 0 >), cannot take the zero value if
the total system the preserves CPT–symmetry. Within the use of the
method mentioned above formulae for Hk acting in the three state
(three dimensional) subspace of states are also found.

1 Introduction.

In the quantum decay theory of multiparticle complexes, properties of the
transition amplitudes

Aψ;uj (t) =< uj|ψ; t >,
are usually analysed. Here vectors {|uj > }j∈U represent the unstable states
of the system considered, < uj|uk >= δjk, and |ψ; t > is the solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation (we use ¯h = c = 1 units)

(1)

having the following form

|ψ; t >= H|ψ; t >,

i

∂
∂t

Xj∈U

|ψ; t >=

aj(t)|uj > +

fJ (t)|φJ >,

XJ

where vectors |φJ > describe the states of decay products, < uj|φJ >= 0 for
every j ∈ U. The initial condition for Eq (2) in the case considered is usually
assumed to be

|ψ; t = t0 ≡ 0 > def= |ψ >≡

aj|uj >,

Xj∈U

fJ (t = 0) = 0.

In Eq (2) H denotes the complete (full), selfadjoint Hamiltonian of the sys-
tem. We have |ψ; t >= e−itH |ψ >. It is not diﬃcult to see that this property
and hermiticity of H imply that

Auj,uj (t)∗ = Auj;uj (−t).

Therefore, the decay probability of an unstable state (usually called the decay
law), i.e., the probability for a quantum system to remain in its initial state
|ψ >≡ |uj >

puj (t) def= |Auj;uj (t)|2 ≡ |aj(t)|2,

must be an even function of time:

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

puj (t) = puj (−t).

This last property suggests that in the case of the unstable states prepared
at some instant t0, say t0 = 0, the initial condtion (4) for the evolution
equation (2) should be formulated more precisely. Namely, from (7) it follows
that the probabilities of ﬁnding the system in the decaying state |uj > at
the instant, say t = T ≫ t0 ≡ 0, and at the instant t = −T are the
same. Of course, this can never occur. In almost all experiments in which
the decay law of a given unstable particle is investigated this particle is
created at some instant of time, say t0, and this instant of time is usually
considered as the initial instant for the problem. From the property (7) it
follows that the instantenous creation of the unstable particle is impossible.
For the observer, the creation of this particle (i.e., the preparation of the
state, |uj >, representing the decaying particle) is practically instantaneous.
What is more, using suitable detectors he is usually able to prove that it
did not exist at times t < t0. Therefore, if one looks for the solutions of the
Schr¨odinger equation (2) describing properties of the unstable states prepared
at some initial instant t0 in the system, and if one requires these solutions to
reﬂect situations described above,one should completement initial conditions
(4) for Eq (2) by assuming additionally that

aj(t < t0) = 0, (j ∈ U),

(8)

and that, for the problem, time t varies from t = t0 > −∞ to t = +∞ only.
Amplitudes of type aj(t) can be calculated directly by solving the evolu-
tion equation (2), or by using the Schr¨odinger–like evolution equation govern-
ing the time evolution in a subspace spanned by the set of vectors {|uj > }j∈U .
Searching for the properties of two particle subsystems one usually uses the
following equation of the type mentioned [1] — [17] instead of Eq (2),

where by Hk we denote the eﬀective nonhermitean Hamiltonian,

and

are (2 × 2) matrices, acting in a two–dimensional subspace Hk of the total
state space H. M is called the mass matrix, Γ is the decay matrix [1] — [7].
The standard method of derivation of such a Hk is based on a modiﬁcation of
Weisskopf–Wigner (WW) approximation [18]. Lee, Oehme and Yang (LOY)
adapted the WW aproach to the case of a two particle subsystem [1] — [6]
to obtain their eﬀective Hamiltonian Hk ≡ HLOY . Almost all properties of
the neutral kaon complex, or another two state subsystem, can be described
by solving Eq (9) [1] — [17], with the initial condition corresponding to (4)
and (8)

|ψ; t = t0 >k ≡ |ψ >k,

k |ψ; t = t0 >k k = 1,

|ψ; t < t0 >k= 0,

(12)

for |ψ; t >k belonging to the subspace Hk ⊂ H spanned, e.g., by orthonormal
neutral kaons states |K0 >, |K 0 >, and so on, (then states corresponding to
the decay products belong to H ⊖ Hk

def= H⊥),

|ψ >k≡ a1|1 > +a2|2 >,

(13)

and |1 > stands for the vectors of the |K0 >,
denotes states of |K 0 >, B0 > type, < j|k >= δjk, j, k = 1, 2.

|B0 >, etc., type and |2 >

The old, as well as the more recent [5] — [7] experimental tests of the
CP–nonivariance and of the CPT–invariance in the neutral kaon system need
a correct interpretation of the measured CP– nad CPT–violation parameters.
In the large literature, all CP– and CPT–violation parameters in the neutral
kaon and similar complexes are expressed in terms of matrix elements of Hk ≡
HLOY . On the other hand, in some papers the correctness and selfconsistency
of the LOY aproximation is questioned [10] — [17], [19]. Theorefore it seems
to be important to examine in detail the derivation of the formulae for HLOY .
The paper is organized as follows. We begin with the discussion of the
Lee, Oehme and Yang theory: Deriving formulae for matrix elements of HLOY
in Sec. 2 we will apply the method used in [3] with isigniﬁcant modiﬁcations.
In Sec. 3 within the use of the same ”receipe” as in Sec. 2, instead of the
formulae for matrix elements, the formula for the complete operator HLOY
is derived and the questionable points of the LOY approach are found. The
eﬀective Hamiltonian Hk = H Imp
LOY improving HLOY is also found in this
Section. The improved LOY method is used in Sec. 4 to derive the eﬀective
Hamiltonian Hk governing the time evolution in the three dimnesional (three
state) subspace of states. Sec. 5 contains a summary and conclusions.

2 Analysis of steps leading to the standard

formulae for HLOY .

2.1 Detailed derivation of HLOY .

Let us now consider all the steps leading to the formulae for the matrix el-
ements of HLOY in detail. As it has already been mentioned, the source of
the LOY model for the decay of neutral kaons is the well known Weisskopf–
Wigner approach to the description of unstable states [18]. Within this ap-
proach, the Hamiltonian H for the problem is divided into two parts H (0)and
H (1):

H = H (0) + H (1),
(14)
such that |K0 >≡ |1 > and |K 0 >≡ |2 > are discrete eigenstates of H (0) for
the 2–fold degenerate eigenvalue m0,

H (0)|j >= m0|j >, j = 1, 2;

(15)

and H (1) induces the transitions from these states to other (unbound) eigen-
states |ε, J > of H (0) (here J denotes such quantum numbers as charge, spin,
etc.), and, consequently, also between |K0 > and |K 0 >. So, the problem
which one usually considers is the time evolution of an initial state, which is
a superposition of |1 > and |2 > states.

In the kaon rest–frame, this time evolution for t ≥ t0 ≡ 0 is governed by
the Schrodinger equation (2), the solutions |ψ; t > of which have the following
form

|ψ; t >= a1(t)|1 > +a2(t)|2 > +

FJ (ε; t)|ε, J >,

(16)

XJ,ε

and

|a1(t)|2 + |a2(t)|2 +

|FJ(ε, t)|2 = 1.

(17)

Here |FJ; t >≡
nel J; < ε, J|k >= 0, k = 1, 2; < ε′, L|ε, N >= δLN δ(ε − ε′).

ε FJ (ε; t)|ε, J > represents the decay products in the chan-

P

J,L(ε, ε′) =< J, ε|H (1)|ε′, L >, and H (1)
kl
=< k|H (1)|l >; k, l = 1, 2. These equations are exact. In agreement with
(12), the boundary conditions for Eqs (18), (19) are following:

ak(0) = ak, ak(t < 0) = 0, (k=1,2),

and

so

FJ (ε; t = 0) = 0,

|a1|2 + |a2|2 = 1.

In the WW approach to solving the Schr¨odinger equation (2) it is required
that the martix elements of type H (1)
jk , H (1)
kJ (ε), etc., should be suitably small
[18]. From [1, 2] and [3] one can conlude thatthe LOY modiﬁcation of the
WW method consists of assuming that, among others,

|H (1)

jk | ≪ m0,

(j=1,2),

|H (1)

Assumptions of type (23) — (26) were used by LOY in order to replace
the exact equations of type (18), (19) by approximate equations (18) —

Eqs (27), (28) diﬀer from LOY Eqs (18) — (20) of [1], among others, in the
ﬁrst componets of their right sides . Such components are absent in the LOY
equations. This diﬀerence is caused by using the interaction representation in
[1] and rescaling the energy, ε: ε → ω = ε −m0, which means that the zero of
energy is taken to be the rest energy of K. Another diﬀerence is the following:
In the right sides of the LOY equations factors of type e±iωt are present.
They are absent in Eqs (27), (28). The presence of these factors in LOY
equations is due to the use of the interaction representation. Nevertheless,
the mathematical equivalence of Eqs (27), (28) and Eqs (18) — (20) of [1] is
rigorous.

The WW theory states that under the assumptions (23) — (26), the
actual contribution of the second component on the rigth side of Eq (27) into
the amplitude ak(t) is very small and, in fact, it resolves itself into adding
some small complex number, say Λ, to the parameter m0, such that |Λ| ≪ m0,
and Im. Λ = − γ
2 < 0. Simply, the interactions which are responsible for the
presence of this second component in the considered equation slightly shift
the level m0: m0 → m0 + Λ. So, the replacement of Eq (27) by the following
approximate one seems to be justiﬁable

i

∂
∂t

ak(t) ≃ (m0 + Λ)ak(t),

(k=1,2; t > 0).

(29)

which means that under the conditions (23) — (26), the amplitudes ak(t)
should take the following form

ak(t) ≃ e−i(m0+Λ)tak, (k=1,2; t > 0),

Therefore, when one looks for the solutions of Eq (27), the use of the as-
sumption

(30)

(31)

a1(t)

is considerd to be obvious. This assumption is equivalent to the LOY as-
sumption (21) of [1] (or, (A1.1) in [3], Appendix of Chap. 5), which is easily
seen if (31) is rewritten in the LOY manner:

where

|ψ; t >k= e−i(m0+Λ)t|ψ >k, (t > 0),

|ψ; t >k= a1(t)|1 > +a2(t)|2 > .

The assumption (31) (or (32) ) is crucial to the LOY method and it is the
essence of the approximation which was made in [1, 3]. It determines all the
properties of the eﬀective Hamiltonian HLOY governing the time evolution
in a two state subspace.

˜FJ (ε; t) =

which can easily be solved and leads to the following solution for FJ (ε; t)
with t ≥ 0:

The main properties of the quasistationary, or bound states manifest
themselves at times t ≫ t0 = 0, where t0 is the moment of their preparation.
Therefore, it is reasonable to replace the upper limit t < ∞ of the integrals
in Eq (38) by t → ∞. Also, as it was mentioned, Λ is a very small number.
So, the formulae for the lowest notrivial order of the matrix elements hLOY
of HLOY , are obtained by putting Λ = 0 under the integrals in Eq (38) and
then evaluating these integrals and passing to the limit t → ∞. (In this
case these matrix elements will be denoted by hLOY (0)
, and the the eﬀective
Hamiltonian by H (0)

LOY ). Such a treatment of Eq (38) gives (compare [3] )

2.3 CPT transformation properties of HLOY .

Usually, in the LOY and related approaches, it is assumed that the free
Hamiltonian H (0) is CPT–invariant [1] — [7]:

where Θ is the antiunitary operator:

and C is the charge conjugation operator, P — space inversion, and the
antiunitary operator T represents the time reversal operation. (Basic prop-
erties of anti–linear and linear operators, their products and commutators
are described, eg., in [20, 21, 22]).

Using, e.g., the following phase convention [2] — [6]

Θ|1 >def= −|2 >, Θ|2 >def= −|1 >,

which means that the subspace of neutral kaons Hk is assumed to be invariant
under Θ:

one easily ﬁnds from (42) that in the case of the CPT–invariant interactions

i.e., in the CPT–invariant system

[Θ, P ] = 0,

[Θ, H (1)] = 0,

[Θ, H] = 0,

the diagonal matrix elements of H (0)

LOY must be equal:

hLOY (0)
11

= hLOY (0)
22

.

This is the standard result of the LOY approach and this is the picture which
one meets in the literature [1] — [12].

3 Improved LOY approximation.

3.1 General considerations.

In the previous Section the coupled system equations (18), (19) for number
functions (amplitudes) ak(t), FJ (ε; t) have been analysed. While considering
each of the equations separately there is a danger of overlooking some com-
mon, global properties of a such system and thus similar properties of the
physical system under consideration. It seems that a complex look at the
equations governig the time evolution in the subsystem considered should
either conﬁrm all the conclusions and formulae derived above or show that
they are incorrect. It should also indicate all the questionable steps in the
standard derivation of HLOY . So, let us consider the evolution equations for
the components |ψ; t >k (13), (49) and for |ψ; t >⊥ (51) of the state vec-
tor |ψ; t > (16) instead of the system equations for number functions ak(t),

11

FJ (ε; t). Using projection operators P and Q, (43), (44), one can obtain
from the Schr¨odinger equation (2) for the state vector |ψ; t > two equations
for its orthogonal components |ψ; t >k (13), (49) and |ψ; t >⊥ (51) valid for
t ≥ t0 = 0:
∂

|ψ; t >k = P HP |ψ; t >k +P HQ|ψ; t >⊥,

|ψ; t >⊥ = QHQ|ψ; t >⊥ +QHP |ψ; t >⊥,

≡ QHQ|ψ; t >⊥ +QH (1)P |ψ; t >⊥,

with the initial conditions (12), (13) and (21), which are equivalent to the
following one

|ψ; t = 0 >⊥= 0.

Let us consider a general case of Eqs (59) and (61). According to the
LOY method, as in the usual single line width problem of atomic transitions
[18], the contribution arising from decay products |ψ; t >⊥∈ H⊥ into the time
derivative i ∂
∂t|ψ; t >k in Eq (59) should be eliminated. Within this method,
assuming that such a contribution is suitably small, one requires i ∂
∂t|ψ; t >k
to be expressed in terms of |ψ; t >k only. From the superposition principle
one conludes that such an expression should be time independent and linear.
Therefore, to fulﬁll this requirement, if the transitions from the subspace of
decay products H⊥ ∋ |ψ; t >⊥ are suﬃciently weak (see ([23])), i.e., if for
every ﬁnite t ≥ 0,

k P HQ|ψ; t >⊥k ≪ k P HP |ψ; t >kk,

the following substitution into Eq (59) should be made

P HQ|ψ; t >⊥= P H (1)Q|ψ; t >⊥≡ Vk|ψ; t >k,

where Vk is in general a nonhermitian operator (a nonhermitian matrix)
acting in the subspace Hk ∋ |ψ; t >k. Then, to a very good approximation,
Eqs (59), (60) take the required form

This means that one should the expect solutions of (59), (60) to have the
exponetial, similar to (31) and (32), form:

|ψ; t >k = e−it(P HP + Vk)|ψ; t = 0 >k

≡ e−it(m0P + P H (1)P + Vk)|ψ; t = 0 >k,

and, as it has been done in the LOY theory, such a form of |ψ; t >k will be
used for the calculation of the eﬀective Hamiltonian Hk,

Hk

def= P HP + Vk
≡ m0P + P H (1)P + Vk,

governing the time evolution in the subspace considered.

Solving Eq (61) one can eliminate |ψ; t >⊥ from Eq (59) by substituting
the solution of Eq (61)back into Eq (59). Looking for this solution we will
follow the method used to solve Eq (19) in Sec. 2. Namely, by means of the
substitution

def= e+itQHQ|ψ; t >⊥, (t ≥ 0),

ψ; t >⊥

Eq (61) can be replaced by the following one

ψ; t >⊥ = e+itQHQQHP |ψ; t >k, (t ≥ 0),
g

which is in perfect agreement with the result (36) in Sec. 2.
Substituting (74) back into Eq (59) gives for t ≥ 0:

i

|ψ; t >k= P HP |ψ; t >k −i

P HQe−i(t − τ )QHQQHP |ψ; τ >k dτ,

(75)
which is an analogon of Eq (37) in Sec. 2. Notice that in contradistinction
to Eq (37) mentioned, Eq (75) is exact. (In the literature, equations of type

Eq (37) are called ”master equation” [24], or Krolikowski–Rzewuski equation
for the distinguished component of a state vector [25] — [29]).

Now inserting the expected exponential form of |ψ; t >k (68) into Eq
(75) and, taking into account (as in Sec. 2) the fact that all characteristic
properies of bound, or quasistationary states manifest themselves at times
t ≫ t0, practically for t → ∞, (here t0 is the moment of the preparation of
the subsystem considered), one obtains, to a very good approximation

On the other hand, if the solution (74) of Eq (61) is directly substituted
into Eq (65), and one keeps in mind the above motivation in relation to time

So, the consistently applied LOY method leads to the nonlinear equation
for the eﬀective Hamiltonian Hk, (70), governing the time evolution in the
subspace Hk. Similar equations one can meet in theories of equations of the
”master equation” type, [24]— [29].

Solutions of Eq (78) can be found, e.g., by means of the iteration method.

Taking into account the fact that the contribution of the component |ψ; t >⊥
into Eq (59) for |ψ; t >k is (by the assumption (64)) very small, and therefore
that the matrix elements of the operator Vk, (65), expressing this contribution
should be very small also, it seems reasonable to assume that

V (0)
k = 0.

(81)

Such an assumption corresponds with the similar one exploited in the LOY
approach, i.e., which is made in Sec. 2 for the parameter Λ appearing in
formulae (29) — (32), where the ﬁnal formulae for the matrix elements of
HLOY were obtained by assuming that Λ = 0 (see Eq (39)). Therefore the
identiﬁcation of the approximate solutions V (1)
of Eq (79) with the LOY
eﬀective Hamiltonian Hk = HLOY , (or with the improved LOY eﬀective
Hamiltonian Hk = H Imp

LOY ), by the relation (70),

LOY ) = H (1)

(82)

seems to be well–grounded.

3.2 Assumptions leading to the standard form of HLOY .

Analysing the LOY derivation of the eﬀective Hamiltonian discussed one can
observe that the components containig the matrix elements H (1)
kl , (k, l = 1, 2),
are neglected in the right sides of the LOY equations equivalent to Eqs(27) in
Sec. 2 (see Eqs (18), (19) in [1], or, Eqs (A1.4), (A1.5) in [3], Chap. 5,
Appendix 1). The analogous form of Eq (60) can be justiﬁed if for every
ﬁnite t ≥ 0

k P H (1)P |ψ; t >kk ≪ k P H (1)Q|ψ; t >⊥k .
(This condition replaces the earlier one (25) used in Sec. 2). Assuming that
inequality (83) holds, instead of Eq (60), to a suﬃciently good approximation,
one can consider the following equation

(83)

i

∂
∂t

|ψ; t >k

∼= m0P |ψ; t >k +P H (1)Q|ψ; t >⊥, (t ≥ 0).

(84)

Next, according to the ideas leading to Eqs (66), (67), using (65) this equation
should be replaced by

i

∂
∂t

|ψ; t >k

∼=

m0P + Vk
n

|ψ; t >k, (t ≥ 0).
o

(85)

15

From this, one can conclude that if condition (83) is fulﬁlled then the solution
of Eq (60) should have exactly the same exponential form (32) as the solution
of the LOY equations (18), (19) in [1], (see [1]), formula (21)),

|ψ; t >k

∼= e−it(m0P + Vk)|ψ; t = 0 >k≡ e−it(m0 + Vk)|ψ >k .
Similarly to the Eq (78) and according to the taken assumptions,such a form
of solution of Eq (60) generates the suitable operator Vk,

(86)

t

Vk = −i lim

t→∞ Z
0

P H (1)Qe−i(t − τ )QHQQH (1)P ei(t − τ )(m0 + Vk) dτ. (87)

This expression, by relations (79), (81), to the lowest nontrivial order, gives

where

V (1)
k = −Σ(m0),

(89)

Σ(x) = P HQ

1
QHQ − x − i0

QHP

≡ P H (1)Q

QHQ − x − i0

QH (1)P.

Relations (88) and (82) deﬁne the eﬀective Hamiltonian H (1)
with HLOY . So, one can write

k , which coincides

HLOY = m0P − Σ(m0).

(90)

From the course of the derivation of this eﬀective Hamiltonian it follows that
such an identiﬁcation of H (1)
k with HLOY is justiﬁable. One should stress
that such an approximation for HLOY can be considerd as suﬃciently good
and correct provided that for every t ≥ 0 the requirement (83) holds.
There is an insigniﬁcant diﬀerence between this HLOY and H (0)

LOY (46)
derived in Sec. 2. It occurs because the exact solution (74) of Eqs (61), (62)
was used, when the formula was derived for Vk in this Section, contrary to the
case of H (0)
LOY , where the approximate solutions (36) of Eq(19), corresponding
to Eq (61) were used.

Note that in the case of HLOY considered, and CPT symmetry conserved,

assumptions (54) — (57) imply

3.3

Improved HLOY .

Let us consider in detail some implications of the main assumption of the
LOY theory, i.e., the relation (86), which is equivalent to (32), (31) in Sec,
2 and (21) in [1]. This relation and similar ones are a direct consequence of
the assumption (83) and the other ones of this type.

Note that the relation (65) and the initial condition (63) states that

Vk|ψ; t = 0 >k = P HQ|ψ; t = 0 >⊥≡ 0,
Vk|ψ; t > 0 >k = P HQ|ψ; t > 0 >⊥6= 0.

(92)
(93)

The result (92) means that neglecting the component P H (1)P |ψ; t >k in the
right side of Eq (84) leads, by the relation (86), to the trivial form for the
|ψ; t >k:

|ψ; t >k= e−it(m0P + Vk)|ψ; t = 0 >k≡ e−itm0 |ψ >k,

(94)

which does not reﬂect the real processes occuring, e.g., in the neutral kaon
complex. In other words, the assumptions of type (83), the only ones under
which HLOY can be derived, force two state unstable system considered to
behave as one state (one level) stationary subsystem. Thus, the substitutions
of type (86) into the Eq (76), or Eq (77), i.e., the Eq (87) can not result
in the approximate eﬀective Hamiltonian (82) describing correctly the real
properties of a two state unstable subsystem.

A detailed analysis of the assumption (83) guaranteeing the approximate
eﬀective Hamiltonian governig the time evolution in two dimensional sub-
space of states to be of the LOY form (90) indicates that such an assumption
cannot be fulﬁlled for every t ≥ 0. One ﬁnds that at t = 0, and thus at
0 < t → 0 it is not satisﬁed. Namely, it is not consistent with the initial
condition (63). From (63) it follows that P HQ|ψ; t = 0 >⊥= 0, and thus
P HQ|ψ; t → 0 >⊥≃ 0. So, keeping in mind that k |ψ; t = 0 >kk= 1 one con-
>
cludes
k P H (1)Q|ψ; t → 0 >⊥k≃ 0 for 0 < t → 0 instead of (83). This means
that the derivation of HLOY is incoherent. (The same conclusion refers to all
derivated formulae for the LOY eﬀective Hamiltonian in the literature, in-
cluding [1] –[5], where the approximations equivalent to the assumption (83)
were used). On the one hand, in the LOY treatment of time evolution in a
two state subspace initial conditions are deﬁned for t = t0 ≡ 0 and solutions

P H (1)P |ψ; t → 0 >kk

there must bek

that

17

of approximate equations of Eq (84) type are discussed for t ≥ t0 = 0, up
to t = +∞. On the other hand, within this treatment the approximation of
type (83) is used and this approximation in not true for the whole domain of
the parameter t, but only for its part (for t ≫ t = t0 = 0). In other words,
conditions of the (83) type can never reﬂect the real properties of time evo-
lution in the two state subsystem considered. Therefore HLOY is unable to
describe correctly all the real properties of the system under considerations.
The defects of the LOY method described above can be easily rectiﬁed.
It is suﬃcient to abandon this questionable condition (83). In other words,
instead of approximate equations of type (84) one should use equations of
the type (59), (60) containing component P H (1)P |ψ, t >k, (or, matrix ele-
ments Hjk, (j, k = 1, 2) in the case of equations of the type (18)). Thus,
the exponential form of |ψ, t >k given by the relation (86) cannot be con-
sidered at all, but only the one given by the formula (69) should be used.
Indeed, the problem expressed by the relation (94) disappears when one uses
relation (69). In such a case using (92), taking into account that generally
[P H (1)P, Vk] 6= 0 and expanding (69) in the power series one ﬁnds that, e.g.,
for very short times t → 0, there is, among others, a component of type
− t2
2 VkP H (1)P |ψ; t = 0 >k 6= 0 in such an expansion. Therefore one can state
that, contrary to (94), the relation (69) leads to the nontrivial result, i.e.,
that Vk situated in the exponent of the expression (69) acts nontrivially on
|ψ; t = 0 >k,

e−it(m0P + P H (1)P + Vk)|ψ; t = 0 >k 6= e−it(m0P + P H (1)P )|ψ; t = 0 >k .
(95)
So, let us use the above mentioned improvements of the LOY method
and ﬁnd the approximate V (1)
by means of the formula (79) for
k
P HP = m0P + P H (1)P , which can be derived assuming that |ψ; t >k has
the form (69). In such a case relations (79) and (81) yield

contrary to the standard LOY result (58). It should be emphasized in this
place that improving the LOY method, only the consistency of the initial
conditions (12) and (63) (or (20) and (21) ) for the problem with the ap-
proximations used (64), (69) and with the geometry (the dimension) of Hk
has been taken into account much more rigorously than it was made by
Lee, Oehme and Yang. All steps leading to the formulae for H Imp
LOY are well
founded and do not impair the main ideas of the standard LOY method.
So, the H Imp
LOY should reﬂect the real properties of the system considered
much better than it is possible within the use of the standard LOY eﬀective
Hamiltonian (42), (46).In this context, the result (106) seems to have serious
consequences when interpreting CPT invariance tests, e.g., for the neutral
kaon complex.

4 Eﬀective Hamiltonian Hk for three state

complex.

Using the LOY method the eﬀective Hamiltonian Hk governing the time
evolution in n–dimensional subspace Hk of state space H for n > 2 can also
be found. A derivation of such a Hk is rather time consuming when one
uses the standard LOY approximation and considers equations of type (18),
(19) for amplitudes aj(t), (j = 1, 2, . . . , n), (3). On the other hand, such
a purpose can be realized relatively easy if one applies the improved LOY
method used in Sec. 3 and uses Eqs (59), (61) for components |ψ; t >k,
|ψ; t >⊥, (49), (51), of a state vector |ψ; t >∈ H instead of the mentioned
equations for amplitudes aj(t). These equations together with the initial
condition (63) and assumptions (64), (65) lead to the Equation (78) for Vk
and thus, by (79), (81), (similarly to the case considered in Subsection 3.3), to
the approximate formula (82) for the improved eﬀective Hamiltonian H (1)
k . In
the case of a three level subsystem this eﬀective Hamiltonian will be denoted
the symbol V (3d)
as H (1)
will be used. Considering the general case described by Eqs (59), (61), and
using (79) one ﬁnds

So, the only problem is to calculate exp[itP HP ] in (107) for the case of

Let the subspace Hk be spanned by a set of orthonormal vectors
{|ej > }j=1,2,3. ∈ H, < ej|ek >= δjk. Then the projection operator P
deﬁning this subspace (see (48) ) can be expressed as follows

P =

,

k

(109)

where I (3d)
and the complementary projector Q, (44), equals Q = I − P .

is the unity for the three dimensional subspace Hk considered,

k

The operator P HP is selfadjoint, so the (3×3) matrix representing P HP
in the subspace Hk is Hermitian matrix. Solving the eigenvalue problem for
this matrix,

P HP |λj >= λj|λj >, (j=1,2,3),

(110)
one obtains the eigenvalues λj = λ∗
j , and eigenvectors |λj >, (j = 1, 2, 3).
For simplicity we assume that λ1 6= λ2 6= λ3 6= λ1, i.e., that all |λj > are
orthogonal,

< λj|λk >=< λj|λj > δjk, (j,k=1,2,3).

By means of these eigenvectors one can deﬁne new projection opertors,

Pj

def=

< λj|λj >

|λj >< λj|, (j=1,2,3).

The property (111) of the solution of the eigenvalue problem for P HP con-
sidered implies that

PjPk = Pjδjk, (j=1,2,3),

and that the completeness requirement for the subspace Hk

holds. Now, using the projectors Pj one can write

Pj = P,

Xj=1,2,3

P HP =

Xj=1,2,3

and

P e+itP HP = P

e+itλj Pj.

Xj=1,2,3

(116)

This last relation is the solution for the problem of ﬁnding exp[itP HP ]

and leads to the following formula for V (3d)

time evolution in the three state subspace Hk of the total state space H.

The results obtained in this Section can be easy generalized to the case

of dim(Hk) = n > 3.

5 Final remarks.

Detailed analysis of assumptions leading to the standard form of the LOY
eﬀective Hamiltonian governing the time evolution in a two state subsystem
indicates that some assumptions, which have been used in the LOY treat-
ment of the problem, and which the WW theory of single line width uses,
should not be directly applied to the case of two, or more, level subsys-
tems interacting with the rest of the physical system considered. Namely,
when one considers the single line width problem in the WW manner it is
quite suﬃcient to analyse the smallness of matrix elements of the interac-
tion Hamiltonian, H (1), only. For the multilevel problem,contrary to the
single line problem, such a smallness does not ensure the suitable smallness
of components of the evolution equations containing these matrix elements.
Moreover, there is no necessity of taking into account the internal dynamics
of the subsystem, which also has an eﬀect on the widths of levels in many
levels subsystems, in such a case. The observed level widths in two and more
level subsystem depend on the interactions of this subsystem with the rest,

23

but they also depend on the interactions between the levels forming this sub-
system. So, the internal interactions in the subsystem considered can not
be neglected when one wants to describe the real properties of multi state
subsystems.

From the form of Eqs (18) — (20) in [1] (or, Eqs (A1.) — (A1.6) in
[3], Appendix 1 of Chap. 5) it follows that the LOY and related treatments
of time evolution in two state subsystem use the WW theory of the single
line width withoutany modiﬁcation of the questionable points of the WW
method and do not consider at all the aspects of time evolution in many state
subsystem mentioned above. When one wants to apply the LOY method of
searching for the properties of the time evolution in a two level subsystem, in
order to be more rigorous than it was done in [1] — [9] and than it is possible
within the standard WW approach, one should replace requirements (24) —
(26) by the following ones

FJ (ε; t)H (1)

kJ (ε)| ≪ m0|ak(t)|,

(k=1,2),

J,L(ε, ε′)| ≪ |

H (1)

Jk (ε)ak(t)|.

(121)

Xk=1,2

Such a form of assumptions replacing (24) — (26) enable, e.g., to detect
the inconsistencies between the main LOY assumption (31) (or, (32) ) and
the initial condition (21). From (21) it follows that the requirments of type
(120), the only ones under which the approximate Eqs (27) are suﬃciently
accurate, can not be fulﬁlled for t = 0 and for t → 0.
(It is impossible
to draw a similar conclusions from the assumptions of type (25) ). So, the
expected and assumed exponential form, (32), of |ψ; t >k, (33), should take
into account the fact that for short t the inﬂuence of H (1) on the form of
|ψ; t >k predominates over the the inﬂuence coming from the component
J,ε FJ (ε; t) in Eq (18). The infuence of this last component can
containing
become crucial only for suﬁciently large times t ≥ Tas > 0. It seems to be
obvious that |ψ; Tas >k6= |ψ; t = t0 = 0 >k. So, whether one should replace
|ψ; t = 0 >k by |ψ; t = Tas >k in the assumption (32), or one should leave
|ψ; t = 0 >k unchanged in (32) but change the index of the power in (32)

adding H (1), cut down to the subspace Hk, there. These cases, similarly
to the improved LOY method used in Subsection 3.3, lead to the eﬀective
Hamiltonian Hk = H Imp
LOY , which diﬀeres from the standard LOY eﬀective
Hamiltonian H (0)

LOY , (42), (46).

Analysing the standard derivation of HLOY [1, 3] one can draw a conclu-
sion which seems to be strange that conditions of type (24) — (26), necessary
to obtain this HLOY , lead to the same form of the efective Hamiltonian, Hk,
governing the time evolution in subspace Hk independently of the dimen-
sion of this Hk. This means that the properties of the subsystem considered
which manifests itself during the time evolution, should not depend on the
dimension of the subspace of states of this subsystem. The common form of
Hk is given by (46) and (90) and this is the form which can be obtained by
means of the improved LOY method only for one–dimensional subspace Hk.
Taking

P ≡ |ψ >< ψ| def= Pψ, Q = I − Pψ,

where < ψ|ψ >= 1, one has

and thus, using (79), (81) one can calculate V (1)

, which equals

P HP =< ψ|H|ψ > Pψ,

V (1d)
k = −Σψ(< ψ|H|ψ >),

where Σψ(x) is deﬁned by the relation (89) for P ≡ Pψ. So, the approximate
eﬀective Hamiltonian, H (1)
, for the case dim(Hk) = 1 appears to be

, and thus of the eﬀective Hamiltonian H (1)

Such a form of V (1)
k , is produced
by the standard LOY approach for the case of the arbitrary dimension of
Hk. From the last formula and from the relations (118), (108), and (102) it
follows that the form of the eﬀective Hamiltonians obtained within the use
of the improved LOY method desribed in Sec. 3 depends on the geometry of
the problem, i.e., on the dimension of the subspace Hk. Such an implication
of the improved LOY method, (contrary to the result, which can be obtained
by the standard LOY method), seems to be quite natural and obvious for
the real physical systems. Therefore the improved LOY method, which is

consistent with the initial condition for the problem, (21) or (63), and more
rigorous than the standard one, should reﬂect the real properties of the sys-
tem considered more accurately than it is possible within the use of the LOY
theory in its original form.

Note that, as it has been shown in Sec. 4, the discussed improved method
allows one to relativelly easy compute the eﬀective Hamiltonian Hk for n–
dimensional (n ≥ 2) subspace H of states.

The last observation is that comparing the formulae for the matrix ele-
ments, (103), of the improved LOY eﬀective Hamiltonian, H Imp
LOY , with the for-
def= Hk(t → ∞)
mulae for the matrix elements of the eﬀective Hamiltonian Hk
derived from the Krolikowski–Rzewuski equation [25] — [27] in [28] and dis-
cussed also in [23], one ﬁnds that all they are identical. Also, the general
formula, (78), (79), for the operator V (1)
is simply the asymptotic case of
k
the formula for V (1)
(t) obtained in [28, 29], namely V (1)
(t).
So, the formalism applied in [23, 28] and also in [15] to describe the prop-
erties of neutral the kaon and similar complexes, should not be considered
as an alternative approach to the description of time evolution in such com-
plexes. Simply, the formalism mentioned is more rigorous than the improved
LOY method, but both these approaches produce the same formulae for the
approximate eﬀective Hamiltonians for the problem.

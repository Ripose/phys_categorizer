A correlation between drag and an integral property of the wake 

T. S. Morton*

Abstract 

  An integral quantity is presented which appears to relate the wake of a body in nominally 
two-dimensional flow to its drag, without the use of viscosity. It is defined in a region of fluid 
as the ratio of the kinetic energy to the vorticity in the fluid boundary and, for the special case 
of laminar flow, is proportional to the angular momentum of the fluid. A relation involving 
the  new  quantity  is  presented  which  is  useful  for  correlating  drag  data  for  circular  and 
rectangular  cylinders,  normal  flat  plates  with  and  without  splitter  plates,  wedges,  and  v-
gutters. 

Keywords: Wake; Drag; Boundary; Cylinder; Wedge; Plate; Splitter plate 

1. Introduction 

 
The long distances traveled by golf balls have been generally explained in terms of high 
momentum transport from the turbulent, unseparated boundary layer (see Davies 1949). The 
drag  reducing  capability  of  riblets  (see  Walsh  and  Lindemann  1984,  Coustols  1996)  has 
likewise  been  explained  in  similar  terms.  However,  Djenidi  et  al.  (1994)  found  that 
appropriately  sized  riblets  reduce  frictional  drag  in  laminar  flows  as  well,  at  least  on  a  per 
unit of wetted length basis. The most generally accepted explanation is that conditions along 
the  upstream  boundary  layer,  such  as  surface  roughness,  increase  turbulence  and  thereby 
reduce drag (see, e.g., Granger 1995, p. 785). Bloor (1964), however, found that as Reynolds 
number  increases,  turbulence  creeps  into  the  wake  towards  the  body  from  far  downstream 
rather than from upstream. Moreover, the measurements of Cantwell and Coles (1983) show 
that the entire wake can be made fully turbulent and yet the upstream boundary layer remain 
laminar  and  forward  on  the  body.  Therefore,  the  condition  of  the  upstream  boundary  layer 
may be associated with an increase in turbulence in the wake bubble, but it seems not to be 
the  direct  cause  of  the  turbulence.  What  the  upstream  boundary  layer  is  a  direct  cause  of, 
however, is vorticity in the wake. This paper  proposes a new quantity useful in correlating 
aerodynamic drag of bluff bodies to flow properties of the near wake. In the context of bluff-
body flows, the quantity is the ratio of the kinetic energy (mean, periodic, and turbulent) to 
the vorticity in the wake of the body. 

Early discussions on the enhanced flying characteristics of spinning projectiles, enabled, 
 
for example, by the rifling of a gun barrel, focused primarily on gyroscopic stability (Milne-
Thomson  1968  p.  558;  Thwaites  1960,  p.  418).  The  improvements  to  the  aerodynamic 
characteristics  of  the  spinning  Frisbee  were  attributed  to  spoilers  that  “disrupt  the  airflow”

and “create a turbulent unseparated boundary layer over the convex side of the saucer and… 
result in a reduction of drag especially in high-speed flight and an increase in stability while 
in  flight”  (Headrick  1965).  This  description  parallels  the  classical  explanation  of  drag 
reduction wherein the drag coefficient of a body is reduced due to a tripping of the boundary 
layer to turbulent flow via high momentum mixing. This added momentum is said to cause 
the boundary layer to remain attached farther downstream on the body surface. It is clear that 
a lack of separation improves the drag characteristics of a body. The question remains as to 
what  causes  the  lack  of  separation.  The  phrase  “high  momentum  mixing”  to  explain  this 
phenomenon  has  not  generally  proved  to  be  extremely  useful  from  a  predictive  standpoint. 
More  recent  ring  designs,  based  on  the  Frisbee  concept,  with  a  bulk  of  material  along  the 
outer  radius,  appear  to  have  even  smaller  drag  coefficient.  The  enhanced  flying 
characteristics of these designs are often attributed to the “spoiler” material on the outer rim. 
However,  an  equal,  if  not  greater,  affect  of  the  massive  outer  rim  is  likely  the  prolonged 
rotation sustained by its flywheel affect. As noted by Potts and Crowther (2002), the distance 
record  for  a  thrown  Frisbee  now  stands  at  250m.  The  distance  record  for  any  hand  thrown 
object  was  set  at  406.29m  in  2003  using  the  Aerobie  Pro  Ring  and  then  at  427.2m  by 
Schummy (2005) using a boomerang. It seems unlikely that any non-rotating object could be 
thrown  such  distances,  regardless  of  its  shape  or  stability.  Compare  the  above  facts,  for 
example, with the distance record for the javelin set at 98.48m in 1996. 

  One of the more subtle but curious contributions provided by CFD studies in the last few 
decades  has  been  the  placing  on  fairly  firm  footing  the  idea  that,  under  certain  conditions, 
rotation of a cylinder not only generates lift (Magnus 1852) but also reduces drag (see, e.g., 
Swanson 1961, Tanaka and Nagano 1972, Ingham 1983, Diaz et al. 1985, Badr et al. 1989, 
Ingham and Tang 1990, D’Alessio and Dennis 1994, Kang and Choi 1999, Stojković et al. 
2002, Stojković et al. 2003, Inoue et al. 2003, Mittal and Kumar 2003). Spin-induced drag 
reduction in golf balls has been reported in the experimental studies of Aoki et al. (1998) and 
Aoyama (1998). 

The  major  difficulty  in  theoretically  predicting  the  flow  properties  for  bluff-body  flow 
 
problems lies in the separated boundary layer. Specific problems encountered when trying to 
apply  conventional  boundary  layer  theory  to  separated  boundary  layers  include:  a  lack  of 
knowledge of the proper far stream pressure boundary condition along the surface leading up 
to separation, uncertainty as to the location of the point of separation, and uncertainty as to 
the pressure at which separation occurs. 

  Models of the wake aimed at predicting drag are numerous (Kirchhoff 1869, Joukowsky 
1890,  Riabouchinsky  1920,  McNown  and  Yih  1953,  Roshko  1954,  Lavrentiev  1962,  Wu 
1962, Parkinson and Jandali 1970, Wu 1972, Yeung and Parkinson 1997). These rely heavily 
on a knowledge of the shape of the body in question. The closed wake model suggested by 
Batchelor  (1956)  focused  primarily  on  finding  the  external  flow  past  regions  of  uniform 
vorticity  (see  Childress  1966,  Sadovskii  1971,  Turfus  1993).  Roshko  (1993)  derived  an

expression  for  the  length  of  the  mean  wake  bubble  in  terms of the  base  suction coefficient 
and Reynolds shear stress for a normal flat plate with a trailing splitter plate. Using the free 
streamline  model,  Roshko  was  then  able  to  predict  a  reasonable  value  for  the  drag 
coefficient. However, it is difficult to extend the model to a wake without a splitter plate that 
experiences  vortex  shedding  (Roshko  1993;  Williamson  1996).  Balachandar  et  al.  (1997) 
conducted  a  thorough  review  of  past  wake  models  and  presented  detailed  contours  of  flow 
properties in the wake of cylinders (circular and rectangular) as well as flat plates. 

  Correlations of drag versus flow speed for a given bluff-body shape are complicated by 
factors  such  as  flow  transitions,  surface  roughness  effects,  and  the  choosing  of  the  proper 
characteristic  length  and  area  to  be  used  in  the  Reynolds  number  and  drag  coefficient. 
Rotation  effects  present  an  added  difficulty.  For  these  reasons,  no  single  correlation, 
empirical or otherwise, has been found to relate drag force to flow speed for different body 
shapes and for all flow speeds. 

2. An Integral Quantity Characterizing Vortices 

 
In many bluff-body flow problems, general characteristics of the velocity field are fairly 
well known, at least in the region most critical to drag prediction, i.e., the wake bubble. In 
fact, the common trait among bluff-body flows appears to be the existence of a wake bubble 
in  the  time-mean  flow  field.  For  these  reasons,  a  drag  correlation  will  be  proposed  that 
involves an integral property of the mean wake vortex, that is, either of the symmetric time-
mean vortices in the wake bubble. 

  Drag  can  be  studied  qualitatively  by  comparing  the  drag  characteristics  of  two  limiting 
extremes. Figure 1 shows a bluff body that experiences significant drag, and Figure 2 shows 
a knife edge that is assumed to experience no drag force. Naturally, the case in Figure 2 does 
not occur in reality, but any generally applicable drag correlation should exhibit the proper 
behavior in the limiting case represented by Figure 2. Therefore, the two conceptual extremes 
of Figures 1 and 2 will help to reveal the functional form of the drag correlation. 

 
The application of the drag correlation to follow (see (1)) will require a clear distinction 
between  the  definition  of  the  fluid  domain  and  that  of  the  fluid  boundary.  The  strict 
mathematical  definition  of  a  boundary  would  stipulate  a  set  of  points  forming  an  infinitely 
thin layer of fluid around the body. In contrast, Prandtl’s boundary layer is of finite thickness 
and  extends  to  the  locus  of  points  where  the  velocity  has  reached,  say,  95%  or  99%  of  its 
asymptotic  (ideal  flow)  value.  The  boundary  layer  concept  has  proven  to  be  extremely 
valuable;  however,  in  the  context  of  bluff-body  flows,  it  may  not  be  ideal.  In  the  present 
work, the term boundary will refer to neither of the above definitions, but rather to all fluid 
possessing vorticity. In bluff body flows at appreciable Reynolds numbers, this will coincide 
closely with the fluid enveloped by closed streamlines.

  Consider  Figure  1  to  represent  a  stationary  body  in  a  wind  tunnel  in  which  force  is 
transmitted  from  the  wind  tunnel  walls  to  the  body.  The  wake  bubble  is  the  effect  of  this 
force  that  has  been  transmitted  from  the  stationary  body  to  the  boundary  of  the  fluid,  but 
which has not yet entered the fluid domain. The energy is still contained within the boundary, 
which, for  Figure 1,  is  of  finite  thickness,  i.e.,  the  extent  of  the  mean  wake  bubble.  In  this 
case,  the  thickness  of  the  boundary,  as  defined  here,  is  finite;  the  vorticity  within  the 
boundary is finite; and a drag force exists. 

Ov
 held constant, the average vorticity 
If the wake size were to somehow decrease with 
 
in  the  boundary  would  obviously  increase.  Consider 
Figure  2  to  be  the  limit  of  this  wake 
reduction process. The result is irrotational flow external to the now infinitely thin boundary. 
The distinction with previous definitions of the term “boundary” is that even in ideal flow, a 
“boundary,” as defined here, still exists, albeit with only one streamline – the one that defines 
the body contour. Prandtl’s boundary layer, on the other hand, does not exist in such a flow.

If a fluid boundary is to exist  in  this  limiting case,  the abrupt change in velocity  at the 
 
fluid/body interface requires that the vorticity within that boundary be infinite. Therefore, the 
case of zero drag, i.e., ideal flow, corresponds to infinite vorticity in the fluid boundary. Skin 
friction drag and form drag are contained within the two extremes of Figures 1 and 2. 

 
From a qualitative understanding of the drag in Figures 1 and 2, an infinite vorticity in 
the  boundary  of  a  fluid  domain  is  seen  to  correspond  to inviscid  flow. Consequently,  for a 
given free stream velocity, aerodynamic drag is inversely proportional to the vorticity within 
the  boundary  of  the  fluid.  Part  of  the  reason  for  this  counterintuitive  result  is  due  to  the 
redefinition of the term boundary.

3. Drag Relation 

  As the wake bubble becomes fully turbulent with increasing Reynolds number, the drag 
correlation  involving  the  quantity 
(3)  breaks  down,  while  the  one  involving  the 
quantity  on  the  left  side  of  (2)  remains  valid.  A  discussion  of  why  this  may  be  is  given  in 
§7.3. According to Table 1, (2) cannot be assumed valid generally. However, in the present 
study,  only  two-dimensional  bodies  are  considered;  therefore,  the  spherical  vortex  is  not 
immediately relevant.

The  integration  in  (1)  is  carried  out  over  the  time-mean  wake  vortex,  i.e.,  the  fluid 
boundary.  Flows  containing  only  one  closed  streamline,  namely  that  coinciding  with  the 
contour of the body itself in ideal flow, produce no drag due to the infinite vorticity in the 
boundary. The experimental data in Figure 3 suggest the following relationship:

This relation predicts a reduction in drag with increasing vorticity in the wake, as dictated 
by  Figure  2.  It  also  suggests  that  a  reduction  in  drag  may  be  possible  by  increasing  the 
vorticity in the wake of the body, such as by spinning the body appropriately.

The drag correlation can also be formulated by using Newton’s law, 

, as a form 
 
for  the  correlation,  assuming  that  the  mass  of  fluid  trapped  in  the  wake  vortex  is  constant. 
This allows a force to be associated with the mass, m, rotating in the wake vortex (assumed 
circular for the moment) having a radial acceleration given by

Compare this relation with (4). Correlating bluff-body drag with the radial acceleration in the

force is acting against the back side of the body where the wake vortex is located. 

 

Equation (4) may be cast in the form: 

where μ  is  the  fluid  viscosity,  and V  is  the  vortex  volume.  The  quantity  cD  Re  will  be 
referred to as the dimensionless drag. Figure 3 shows the correlation of dimensionless drag

4.1. Velocity, Pressure, and Vorticity Fields 

Equation  (4),  together  with  the  calculation  of  G  that  follows,  will  allow  the  drag 
 
coefficient of a body to be determined from a velocity specified experimentally at the vortex 
perimeter  and  a  dimension  of  the  mean  wake  bubble.  The  mean  velocity  field  can  then  be 
determined from the analytical solution for the flow in the wake bubble. For the nominally 
two-dimensional  flows  considered,  the  coherent  or  time-mean  velocity  component  can  be 
approximated  by  using  the  velocity  field  within  a  pair  of  elliptical  patches  of  uniform 
vorticity  (see  Morton  1997).  For  flows  exhibiting  vortex  shedding,  the  time  average  in  the 
near wake remains a pair of counter-rotating vortices. The velocity field in an elliptical patch 
of uniform vorticity is, in rectangular coordinates,

Notice from (16) that when turbulent kinetic energy is negligible in the wake vortex, 
 is 
independent of the axis ratio of the cross section of the elliptical vortex and that it is equal to

Therefore  the  ratio  is  invariant  with  respect  to  the  axis  ratio  of  the  vortex  cross  section, 
provided the semi-minor axis and perimeter velocity, vO, remain unchanged.

Here, the characteristic length, D, is the projected body dimension normal to the free stream 
and is used in the Reynolds number. In all values of Table 3 except for those of Cantwell and 
Coles (1983) (which will be discussed in §6 and §7), the turbulent transition waves had not

. 

Here,  St  is  the  classical  definition  of  the  Strouhal  number,  and  n  is  the  number  of  vortices 
shed downstream per shedding cycle, namely 2. Equation (20) can be employed to write (19) 
in  terms  of  the  Strouhal  number  rather  than  the  vortex  perimeter  velocity  ratio.  With  the 
onset of vortex shedding, however, the energy becomes split into a mean component and a 
periodic component. The mean wake bubble dramatically decreases in size with the removal 
of  a  splitter  plate.  This  is  clearly  demonstrated  by  Hwang  et  al.  (2003)  at  lower  Reynolds 
number.  If  the  correlation  for  the  drag  coefficient, (19),  is  modified  to  so  as  to  fit  the  data 
with and without splitter plates, the following form is obtained:

When vortex shedding is absent due to the presence of a splitter plate and the attendant large 
wake bubble, 
; and when vortex shedding is present and the mean wake bubble shrinks, 
.  Therefore,  kinetic  energy  of  the  mean  flow  appears  to  be  doubled  when  the  splitter 
1=δ
plate is removed, the additional portion being in the form of vortex shedding. Since the mean 
kinetic  energy  is  calculated  based  on  the  now  smaller  time-mean  wake  bubble,  the  kinetic 
energy due to vortex shedding must be included by using δ. 

  Using  (21),  drag  predictions  can  be  made  from  steady  or  time-mean  wake  flow 
visualizations; however, the perimeter velocity, 
, must be measured experimentally. The 
dimensionless  distance,  b/D,  to  this  point  from  the  vortex  center  may  then  be  found 
Figure 1). Alternatively, using (20) the 
graphically from visualization of the mean flow (see 
measured Strouhal number and dimensionless semi-major axis, a/D, of the wake vortex may 
be used in lieu of the velocity ratio.

The case to be examined is the set of cylinder experiments made by Cantwell and Coles 
(1983). The purpose of their experiment was to provide measurements of wake flow in which 
the  separation  point  was  laminar,  yet  the  near  wake  region  was  fully  turbulent.  As  it  turns

  At this Reynolds number, the turbulent transition waves have penetrated the wake bubble. 
The result is a noticeable reduction in the size of the wake bubble and a dramatic increase in 
the  fluctuating  component  of  velocity.  Measurements  of  the  needed  velocity  fluctuations

Re

5
×<

In  the  example  shown,  the  drag  coefficient  remains  large  even  after  the  increase  in  the 
 
turbulent kinetic energy within the wake bubble and the decrease in mean wake width. The 
drag  coefficient  finally  decreases  suddenly  when  the  Reynolds  number  is  increased  still 
,  known  as  the  “drag  crisis,”  due  to  the  well 
further  into  the  range 
known  shift  in  the  location  of  the  separation  point.  This  shift  causes  the  vorticity  (the 
(1)) to increase suddenly. Recall that the Reynolds number in the Cantwell 
denominator of 
and Coles experiment was large enough for the mean wake bubble to become almost entirely 
turbulent, yet small enough to ensure that the separation point remain forward on the body. 
The range of Reynolds numbers for which this set of circumstances exists is narrow. At these 
unique  conditions,  the  size  of  the  wake  bubble  is  much  smaller  than  it  is  at  slightly  lower 
Reynolds  numbers,  for  which  the  wake  bubble  is  not  fully  turbulent.  Therefore,  as  the 
Reynolds  number  is  increased  into  this  unique  range,  the  increase  in  fluctuating  kinetic 
energy  in  the  wake  bubble  and  the  reduction  in  the  size  of  the  mean  wake  bubble  occur 
simultaneously.  The  vorticity  in  the  wake  bubble,  on  the  other  hand,  has  not  changed 
appreciably within this narrow range of Reynolds numbers because vorticity within the wake 
volume is a direct function of the distance traveled by the fluid through the boundary layer. 
The sudden reduction in the drag coefficient does not occur until the boundary layer extends 
to the rear of the cylinder, at an even higher Reynolds number. The distance traveled by the 
fluid in the boundary layer is then longer, the vorticity in the denominator of the drag relation 
(1)  is  therefore  higher,  and  hence  the  drag  coefficient  suddenly  decreases  (see  (7)). 
Therefore, the decrease in drag coefficient occurs at a slightly higher Reynolds number than 
does the decrease in wake size.

Situations do exist where advancement of the transition point forward on the body has the 
 
effect of reducing drag (see e.g., Coustols 1996, Gad-el-Hak & Bushnell 1991, Coustols and 
Schmitt 1990). However, this is accomplished by placing distributed roughness elements or 
riblets on the surface, which can themselves be viewed from the standpoint of increasing the 
vorticity in the fluid boundary and hence reducing the function G.

, are listed in 

  At  lower  Reynolds  numbers,  sufficient  whole-field  data  does  not  exist  to  formulate  a 
meaningful  correlation  owing  to  the  complexity of  the  transitions  in  this  regime.  However, 
some of the most complete (for the purposes of the present study) works to date in the range 
Table 3. For a description of the changes occurring in the wake 
100
near  these  Reynolds  numbers,  see  Williamson  (1996a)  or  (1996b)  for  the  circular  cylinder 
and Julien et al. (2003) for the flat plate. In order to better understand the three-dimensional 
behavior of flow in the near wake of a normal flat plate, Wu et al. (2005) analyzed the phase 
difference  of  vortex  shedding  at  two  different  spanwise  locations  and  found  two  distinct 
modes and very pronounced three-dimensionality. Note from Table 3 that just beyond the 3-
D  wake  transition  regime,  the  correlation  appears  to  underpredict  the  drag  coefficient  by  a 
factor of 2. Therefore, visual observation of the wake is clearly inadequate in regimes where 
there are changes in the nature of out-of-plane shedding. Instead of modeling the wake as an 
elliptical patch of uniform vorticity, the correlation in (4) could be better examined at these 
lower  Reynolds  numbers  if  (1)  were  evaluated  directly  as  a  post-processing  procedure  of 
DNS studies.

7.3. Turbulent Angular Momentum 

For turbulent flows, the drag correlation is easier to evaluate using the left side of (2) than 

 
the right. It may be instructive, however, to substitute the right side of (2) into (4) to obtain: 

for  each  half  of  the  wake  bubble.  Therefore,  for  a  given  velocity,  a  higher  force  causes  a 
higher angular momentum per unit area. Turbulence may be an ideal mechanism for filling a 
region with concentrations of angular momentum to accommodate a large force. From Table 
1 and (3), we can write

for a cylindrical vortex, the cross section of which is depicted in Figure 6a. If the cylindrical 
vortex  were  replaced  with  two  counter-rotating  vortices  as  shown  in  Figure  6b  while 
maintaining the same velocity magnitude at points of tangency, the length b would become 
half  of  what  it  was,  as  shown.  There  would  be  no  gain  in  the  storage  capacity  of  angular 
momentum  per  unit  area  or  mass  flow  rate  because,  while  there  are  now  twice  as  many 
vortices,  the  quantity  L/S,  which  according  to  (23)  scales  with  b,  is  cut  in  half  for  each 
vortex. If, however, the original vortex were replaced with four vortices as shown in Figure 
6c, there would be a gain in storage capacity of angular momentum per unit area because b

In §3, it was stated that the drag correlation using  m  broke down when applied to highly 
 
turbulent  wake  bubbles,  while  the  correlation  using  G  remained  valid.  This  is  because 
calculating  m  for a turbulent wake bubble based upon 
Figure 6a is inaccurate, and counting 
turbulent eddies in the equivalent of Figure 6c is impractical.

to the factor of 4 in this equation, it is possible that there is some energy mode, out of plane 
or otherwise, that has been systematically missed in the evaluation of each of the data points 
(26) or 
for the correlation. If so, a factor other than 4 would be required. If a relation such as 
(4) does turn out to be valid generally, not only would it relate drag to flow speed without the 
use of viscosity, but in the form of (26) it may be useful in turbulence modeling or as an eddy 
size criterion in large eddy simulation studies.

7.4. Analogies with Electromagnetism 
 
The  analogies  between  electromagnetic  theory  and  fluid  mechanics  are  numerous  and 
well  known  (see,  e.g.,  Milne-Thomson  1968  p.  574).  Hsu  (1976),  for  example,  found  the 
interesting fact that a tornado cannot be formed if the ground plane is removed. Therefore, 
the touchdown of a tornado resembles the arcing of an electric spark such as lightening. In 
light  of  (2)  and  (4),  a  few  additional  observations  can  be  made.  First,  there  are  some 
interesting  parallels  between  the  quantity  G  of  vortices  and  Planck’s  constant,  h.  Both  are 
ratios  of  energy  to  frequency  (since  vorticity  in  (13)  can  be  related  to  frequency  using 
π2=Ω
),  and  both  seem  to  describe  angular  momentum  (Bohr  1913).  It  is  well  known 
that if Planck’s constant were zero, there would be no quantum mechanics, a value of zero 
for  h  corresponding  to  classical  mechanics.  A  value  of  zero  for  G  corresponds  to  inviscid 
flow,  for  which  the  commutator  of  the  velocity  gradient,  namely  the  vorticity,  is  zero 
everywhere  except  on  infinitely  thin  boundaries.  Fluid  resistance  becomes  appreciable  as 
separation vortices appear, and in metals, superconductivity is lost as soon as vortices appear 
(26) by velocity in order to obtain the power 
(Abrikosov 1988, p. 456). Also, by multiplying 
lost  due  to  drag,  one  obtains  a  relation  that  resembles  the  RI 2
 losses  in  electrical  power 
lines,  the  role  of  resistance  being  played  by  m  in  the  fluid  eddies.  Finally,  there  are 
similarities  between  the  free-stream  velocity  vector  in  bluff-body  flow  and  the  Poynting 
Figure 7 illustrates the relation between the force, the net 
vector of an electromagnetic wave. 
vorticity  vector,  and  the  fluid  velocity  of  a  two-dimensional  bluff  body.  Incidentally,  this 
figure also illustrates why the period of experimentally measured drag oscillation is typically 
half that of the lift oscillations. Drag occurs with the shedding of either of the two vortices, 
whereas lift only occurs with the shedding of one of them.

8. Conclusion 

The drag of two-dimensional bodies appears to be correlated with the ratio of the kinetic 
 
energy to the vorticity in its wake, at least in the range 9×103 ≤ Re ≤ 1.44×105. The fluid 
boundary, defined herein as any fluid possessing vorticity, specifies the volume over which 
the  above  ratio  is  to  be  evaluated.  As  a  limiting  case  of  the  drag  correlation,  ideal  flows 
possess  infinitely  thin  boundaries  and  therefore  infinite  vorticity  in  these  boundaries,  and 
hence  no  drag.  To  aid  in  computing  the  required  ratio  from  existing  test  data,  a  Strouhal 
number formulated using the elliptical vortex patch, can be used in lieu of the time-averaged 
velocity at a point on the vortex perimeter. The correlation indicates that the drag force on a 
body is proportional to the flow speed and the mass flow rate in the boundary of the fluid, 
i.e.,  the  wake  bubble.  This  mass  flow  rate  can  become  unbounded  as  the  scale  of  the 
contained vortices becomes finer.

Appendix 

 
In cases where the quantities necessary for calculating G in the mean recirculation region 
are  reported  directly  from  experimental  studies,  the  following  discussion  is  unnecessary. 
However,  since  these  values  are  rarely  available,  the  quantities  must  be  deduced  from 
available measurements in the wake. 

In order to relate the time-mean wake vortex to the instantaneous vortex shedding, it is 
 
important to realize that the period, Tv, of the pair of elliptical vortices which constitute the 
time-mean  recirculation  region  is  related  to  the  period,  Ts,  of  the  vortex  shedding.  In 
nominally planar flow, the period, Tv, of the time-mean elliptical vortex can be determined 
by integrating (10) around any elliptical streamline, as follows:

time-average wake vortices can be determined by (31) unless a splitter plate trails the body, 
in which case the primary vortex shedding is eliminated. 

  Defining  the  Strouhal  number  in  terms  of  the  mean  wake  bubble  allows  a  natural 
extension  down  to  low  Reynolds  number  flows  exhibiting  the  pair  of  standing  eddies.  For 
Reynolds numbers at which vortex shedding occurs, the time-mean velocity field in the near 
wake still appears as a pair of counter-rotating, elliptical vortices (see, e.g., Van Dyke 1982). 
Below this Reynolds number range, the reciprocal of the period of the standing eddies can be 
used as the Strouhal frequency. As mentioned earlier, the quantity a is the maximum radius 
Ov
of  the  time-mean  elliptical  wake  vortex,  and 
 is  the  perimeter  velocity  at  the  minimum

radius. The Strouhal number defined by

divided by the real part of the vortex eigenvalue, 
near constancy of many Strouhal number groupings is due to the fact that they use length and 
velocity scales that are close to those of the eigenvalue of the mean wake vortex. The above 
relation allows the velocity field in the wake vortex to be estimated by measurements of the 
Strouhal number.

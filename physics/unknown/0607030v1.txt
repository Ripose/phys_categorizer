Abstract. We consider the problem of the period measurement in the case of the following 
scenarios:  stationary  source  of  successive  light  signals  and  accelerating  receiver, 
stationary  receiver  and  accelerating  source  of  successive  light  signals  and  stationary 
machine  gun  that  fires  successive  bullets  received  by  an  accelerating  receiver.  The 
accelerated motion is the hyperbolic one. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
 
A  periodical  phenomenon  is  characterized  by  its  period  that  is  the 
time  interval  between  its  successive  occurrences.  By  definition  a  clock 
generates  a  periodical  phenomenon  characterized  by  a  rigorously  constant 
period. A clock at rest at some point of the plane defined by the axes of the 
  and 
inertial  reference  frame  K(XOY)  generates  the  events 
 by two successive ticks. Here (x,y) are the space coordinates of 
tyxE
,(2
,
t∆  is the time interval between two 
the point where the clock is located and 
successive ticks called proper period of the clock because it is measured as a 
difference between the readings of the same clock located at the point where 
the  two  events  take  place.  Clocks  play  a  fundamental  part  in  Einstein’s 
special relativity. It is considered that at each point of the plane defined by 
the  axes  of  an  inertial  reference  frame  we  find  a  clock,  all  these  clocks 
displaying  the  same  running  time  as  a  result  of  their  synchronization  in 
accordance  with  the  synchronization  procedure  proposed  by  Einstein.1  We 
are  interested  only  in  the  clocks  located  at  the  different  points  of  the  OX 
 located at the origin 
axis, an important role being played by a clock 
O and by a clock 
0C′  that moves with speed V in the positive direction of the 
OX  axis  reading 
0C .  We  present  in

With the new notations (4) leads to

Equation  (7)  accounts  for  the  Doppler  Effect,  establishing  a  relationship 
edt  at which the stationary source of light 
between the proper time interval 
emits the successive light signals and the proper time interval 
rtd ′  at which a 
receding observer receives them. If the observer approaches the source then 
we will have 
 
 
. 
)
As  long  as  the  velocities  involved  are  constant  and  the  motions  take  place 
along  the  line  that  joins  source  and  observer  (longitudinal  Doppler  Effect) 
(7) and (8) hold for finite proper time intervals 
 
The problem is to find out what happens if the involved motions are 
not uniform3,4,5,6,7. The purpose of our paper is to extend the results known 
so far and to underline the difference between the different approaches. We 
use the subscript e for emission and r for reception with primed symbols to 
show that accelerating clocks measure the corresponding quantities and un-
primed  symbols  in  order  to  show  that  stationary  clocks  measure  these 
quantities. 
Equation  (7)  tells  us  that  when  the  observer  is  receding  the  source 
 
rtd ′ , whereas a reduction of 
increasing his velocity the result is an increase of 
the velocity is accompanied by a reduction of the considered time interval. 
Equation (8) tells us that when the observer approaches the source increasing 
his  velocity  the  result  is  a  decrease  of 
rtd ′ ,  whereas  a  reduction  of  the 
velocity is accompanied by an increase of the same time interval. 
 
 
We consider the hyperbolic motion previously known from 8 . This is 
 
a  particular  motion  that  begins  at  x  =  ∞,  t  =  −∞  with  V  =  c  and  proceeds 
through a first deceleration phase when the object approaches the origin x = 
0 with proper acceleration −g until the it reaches the still stand (V = 0) at t = 
0  and  x  =  x0.  Thereafter  for  t  >  0  the  moving  object  enters  a  second 
acceleration  phase  receding  the  origin  with  the  proper  acceleration  +g 
reaching  V  =  c  as  t  (cid:5)  +∞  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  special 
 
relativity. The deceleration and acceleration phases are separated by 
0=′= t
at x0=c2/g. The distance travelled by an accelerating clock may be expressed 
as a function of constant proper acceleration g and either the reading t of a

Unlike  previously  known  approaches  8,3,5  we  will  use  the  novel  notation

and  the  hyperbolic  motion  may  be  approximated  by  the  non-relativistic 
accelerated motion.

The  source  of  monochromatic  light,  located  at  the  origin  O  of  the

only  the  light  signals  that  the  source  emits  at  negative  times.  The  light

4. Stationary source of acoustic waves and accelerating receiver 
The scenario we follow involves a stationary source of plane acoustic 
 
waves  or  a  machine  gun9  that  fires  successive  bullets  at  constant  time 
eT  and an accelerating receiver who performs the motion described 
intervals 
by (9). Figure 8 presents the world line of the accelerating receiver (WLR), 
the world line of the stationary machine gun (WLMG) and the world line of 
the bullet (WLB) emitted at a time  et . R receives the signals for two times 
(events 1 and 2).

When following the time evolution of the accelerating receiver R on 
figure 8 we distinguish the following characteristic situations depending on 
the values of  u/c: 
- WLB doesn’t intersect WLR at all and thus no information change between 
source and receiver takes place, 
- WLB is tangent to WLR (event 1-2) characterized by the emission time

5. Period (frequency) dependence 
In order to be able to measure the period, the observer should receive 
 
at  least  two  successive  wave  crests  (light  signals).  In  the  case  when  the 
period  is  “very  small”  we  can  consider  that  the  observer  receives  the  two 
successive  light  signals  (wave  crests)  being  located  at  the  same  point  in 
space. Under these conditions he is able to perform a continuous recording 
of the period. Returning to (7), which holds in the case of very small periods, 
we  can  recover  Hamilton’s10  result  by  replacing  V  with  its  instantaneous 
value given by (10) as it is shown by Cochran3. We could also start with (13) 
or  with  (19)  allowing  a  continuous  variation  of  the  time  coordinates. 
Differentiating  both  sides  of  the  obtained  equations  we  recover  Cochran’s 
results.  
 
Of  course  all  those  results  hold  only  in  the  case  of  the  “very  small” 
periods. Differentiating both sides of the equations (13) and (16) we recover 
Cochran’s results.  
 Moreau4 calls that situation “locality” in the period measurement. In 
 
the realistic case when the observer receives the two successive light signals 
being located at two different points in space he speaks about “non-locality” 
in the period measurement. 
 
Non-locality  is  favoured  by  high  velocities  and  large  periods  (low 
frequencies).  In  the  case  of  an  accelerating  motion  high  velocities  are 
achieved  after  long  times  of  motion.  As  we  have  mentioned  above,  long 
emission  periods  can  be  achieved  by  periodically  removing  a  shutter  from 
the path of an electromagnetic wave for very short time intervals. The non-
linearity  of  our  equations  (14)  and  (17)  tell  us  that  in  the  experiments 
described above different frequencies are differently shifted. 
We  could  also  characterize  the  effects  studied  above  introducing  the 
 
concept  of  Doppler  factor  D  defined  as  the  quotient  between  the  proper 
reception period and the proper emission period. In the case of the stationary 
observer and accelerating source studied above (18) it is given by

6. Conclusions 
Extending the approaches of Cochran3 and of Moreau4 to the problem 
 
of period measurement by accelerating observers, we reveal some unknown 
aspects of the problem, as the variation of the period with the order number 
of the emitted wave crest or the invariance of the emission and the reception 
periods in respect to each other. The case of the stationary source of acoustic 
waves  and  accelerating  receiver  is  also  studied  revealing  the  change  in  the 
order  in  which  the  successive  wave  crests  are  received.  The  case  of  the 
stationary receiver and accelerating source of acoustic waves remains open 
due to the fact that the velocity of the emitted bullet depends on the velocity 
of the machine gun. Our approach underlines the importance of taking into 
account  the  “non-locality”  in  the  period  measurement  by  accelerating 
observers. Moreau4  considers  only  the  case  of  the period that separates the 
wave crests emitted for N=1 and N=0 respectively.

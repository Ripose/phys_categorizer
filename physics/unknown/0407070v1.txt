We  show  that  a  slab  of  meta-material  (with

m=

= - + (cid:1) )  possesses  a  vortex-like

surface wave with no ability to transport energy, whose nature is completely different 

from  a  localized  mode  or  a  standing  wave.  Existence  of  such  a  mode  inevitably 

generates  characteristic  image  oscillations  in  two  dimensional  focusing  with  even  a 

monochromatic source, which were observed in many numerical simulations, but such 

oscillations  are  weak  in  three  dimensional  focusing.  We  apply  a  rigorous  time-

dependent  Green’s  function  approach  to  establish  relationships  among  important 

quantities  involved  in  super  lens  focusing,  including  the  relaxation  time,  the 

resolution enhancement and the parameter deviation from perfect lens condition.

Veselago proposed that a flat slab of material with 

e

m=

= -

1

could function as a lens 

to focus electromagnetic (EM) waves [1]. Pendry showed that the proposed lens was 

in  fact  a  perfect  one,  which  can  focus  not  only  all  propagating  components  like  a 

usual  lens,  but  also  all  evanescent  waves  from  a  source to  make  the  image  an  exact 

replica  [2].  It  was  then  argued  that  a  small  deviation  in  material  properties 

(i.e.

m

= - +
1

d

and/or

e

= - +
1

d

 )  results  in  a  super  lens  with  imaging  resolution 

beyond  the  usual  diffraction  limit  [3,4].  Several  studies,  including  both  finite-

difference-time-domain (FDTD) simulations [5-10] and theoretical analyses [4,11-14], 

have been performed on such perfect or super lenses. The results obtained so far are, 

however,  not  entirely  consistent.  While  some  studies  confirmed  the  existences  of 

perfect  [12]  or  super  imaging  [4,6-8,11],  issues  were  raised  by  other  authors,  who 

showed  that  a  perfect  image  could  never  be  realized  in  practice  [5,12]  and  no 

enhanced resolution was found in super-lens focusing [9]. 

We note that most studies to-date were interested in the stabilized image pattern under 

a  given  frequency  except  Ref.  [14]  where  the  relaxation  was  studied  by  an 

approximate  model.  Even  with  a  monochromatic  source,  the  switching-on  of  the 

source inevitably  introduces transient waves [15]. Although transient effects are  less 

important for a conventional lens, we show they are crucial in super lens focusing and 

the  super-resolution  is  intimately  related  to  the  transient  phenomena.  A  pioneering 

FDTD  simulation  showed  that  no  steady  foci  were  found  in  perfect  and  super  lens 

focusing  and  the  fields  varied  dramatically  over  time  [5],  against  the  perfect  lens 

prediction  [2].  A  later  FDTD  work  identified  such  dramatic  field  change  as  a 

characteristic oscillation [7]. Other FDTD researchers also observed such oscillations, 

and  they  had  to  add  absorptions  to  obtain  stable  images  in  their  simulations  [8,9]. 

Since the employed sources in all FDTD simulations are strictly monochromatic [5-9], 

the nature of this oscillation, with such a characteristic frequency, is rather intriguing.

different from either a localized mode or a standing wave. Existence of such a mode 

inevitably  leads  to  strong  field  oscillations  in  two  dimensional  (2D)  focusing  with 

even  a  monochromatic  source,  but  such  oscillations  are  weak  in  three  dimensional

the  time  evolution  of  optical  effects  in  meta-material,  and  in  particular,  super  lens 

focusing.  We  apply  a  rigorous  time-dependent  Green’s  function  approach  to 

quantitatively  study  the  transient  phenomena  in  2D  and  3D  focusing.  Through 

establishing  certain  relationships  among 

the  relaxation

transient phenomena s in focusing using meta-materials.

quantitatively  the  focusing  effect.  Using  a  dyadic  Green’s  function

)  are  shown  together  for  comparison.  We  find  that the  time  evolution  is 

dominated  by  damped  oscillations  with  a  characteristic  period,  confirming  recent 

numerical  FDTD  simulation  results  [7].  The  oscillation  frequency  is  determined  by 

the  lens  thickness,  and  a  thinner  lens  yields  a  higher-frequency  oscillation  as  shown 
d = mm. The oscillation amplitude is governed 
by the magenta line in Fig. 1(b) for 
by the damping constant g , and a larger  g suppresses the oscillations better [see dark 

8

yellow  line  in  Fig. 1(b)]. The oscillation  is apparently contributed by the evanescent 

waves  since  results  including  only  propagating  waves  do  not  show  any  oscillations 

[see red lines in Fig. (1)].

The oscillation is closely related to the SW spectrum [17]. Figure 2(a) depicts the SW 

with TE polarization for two lenses with different thicknesses. The SW dispersion for 

a single air/lens  interface  is a straight parallel  line at 10GHz, since the SW solutions 

have  the  same  frequency  for  any 

||k and  any  polarization  when

e

m=

= -

[18].  For  a 

slab with a finite thickness, the coupling between two surfaces split the SW into two 

branches, as shown in Fig. 2(a). The upper (lower) branch of the SW spectrum is even 

(odd)  with  respect  to  the  center  xy  plane  of  the  lens.  We  note  that  the  even-mode 

branch  starts  with  a  positive  group  velocity  near  the  light  line  and  then  becomes 

negative group velocity after passing through a maximum with a zero group velocity. 

Figure 2(b) shows the density of states (DOS) of the SW excitations. In 2D systems, 

the  SW  has  1D  dispersion  properties  and

.  The 

correspondence  between  zero-group  velocity  in  Fig.  2(a)  and  diverging  DOS  in  Fig. 

2(b)  is  obvious.  In  Fig.  2(b),  we  see  a  high  DOS  at  10  GHz,  the  frequency 

corresponding  to the  SW  at  a  single  interface,  as  expected.  This  frequency  has  very 

little  dependence  on  thickness.  Another  high  DOS  is  due  to the  even-symmetry  SW 

state  with  a  zero-group  velocity,  which  is  a  consequence  of  coupling  between  two 

interfaces, and is thus dependent on the slab thickness as Fig 2(b) shows. The “turning 

on”  process  of  the  monochromatic  source  will  inevitably  generate  other  frequency 

components.  Given  the  divergence  in  the  DOS,  the  maximum-frequency  SW  mode 

will  be  picked  out  together  with  the  working  frequency  at  10  GHz,  although  its 

amplitude  is  much  smaller  than  that  of  the  working  frequency  wave  because  of  the

frequency  is  higher  in  a  thinner  slab  due  to  a  larger  splitting  in  the  SW  spectrum 

caused by a stronger interface coupling (see Fig. 2).  

This particular transient wave can only  be dissipated out by absorption. To illustrate 

this point, we plot the field amplitude and the time averaged energy current along the 

x direction (

xS ) as the functions of  z (for

the  evanescent  wave  nature).  This  is  illustrated  by  the  instantaneous  pattern  of  the

Since  such  a  state  does  not  transport  energy,  the  corresponding  fields  of  the  state, 

once excited by the source, cannot be damped out through lateral transport. As a result, 
g =  [5]. With  a  finite g  , the  lens  will 

the  oscillation  will  never  stop  in  the  case  of

0

eventually absorb all the energy stored in such a state, and damp out the oscillations to 

give  a  final  stable  image  [7].  This  provides  a  complete  picture  to  understand  the 

image instability in super lens focusing [5-9]. 

We emphasize that the disability to transport energy of this state is neither induced by 

disorders  (forming  localized  states)  [19]  nor  by  Bragg  scatterings  (forming  standing 

waves) [20], since our system is homogenous in xy plane. The phase velocity is zero 

in a standing wave, but is non-zero here. In fact, another state with an opposite phase 

velocity also possesses a net zero energy current. The negative refraction index of the 

lens, leading to a backward energy current, is the key to obtain such a state. We note 

the  existence  of  such  a  state  is  inevitable  (as  long  as

independent  on  any  specific  form  of

.  Further  works  are  necessary  to 

identify other interesting implications of this unique mode. 

We  now  study  the  3D  case.  In  3D,  the  DOS  for  SW  goes  like

k k

/

w

.  Since 

||k extends  to  infinity  at the  frequency  for  focusing  (10GHz  here)  but  is  finite  at  the 

upper band edge (see Fig. 2(a)), the strength of this vortex-state is relatively decreased 

compared  with  that  of  the  focusing  frequency,  we  thus  expect  weaker  oscillations.

(the traveling time in vacuum). Field values calculated by including only 

the propagating components are again shown for comparison. Figure 4 shows that the 

oscillation is indeed much weaker here although it is observable from a zoomed view. 

This  is  thus  a  marked  dependence  on  dimensionality  of  the  time  evolution,  a  result 

probably not noted before. 

Since  the  oscillation  is  weak  in  3D  focusing,  the  relaxation  time  and  the  resolution 

enhancement can be defined unambiguously. In what follows, we adopt the 3D model 

to  establish  relationships  among  relevant  quantities  involved  in  super  lens  focusing. 

These  relationships  serve  to  construct  a  quantitative  picture  for  the  transient  wave 

physics.  It  is  clear  that  while  a  short  time  is  needed  for  field  contributed  by 

propagating  components  to  relax  to  its  stabilized  value  (black  line),  much  longer 

times are  needed when evanescent waves are  included (red and blue  lines). We  note 

that  the  relaxation  speed  may  be  different  for  fields  at  different  points.  Here,  we 

define the relaxation time  Rt as the time when the electric  field at the exit surface of 

the  lens  (red  line  in  Fig.  4)  reaches  95%  of  its  stabilized  value.  This  is  our  first 

criterion  and  later  we  will  show  the  physical  conclusion  is  independent  on  such  a 

specific definition. The relaxation time Rt

 and the resolution enhancement  R  are then 

calculated  for  lenses  with  different g .  Here,  R  is  defined  as

0 /w w where 0w  is  the 

diffraction-limited  value.  R is  plotted  against g  in  Fig.  5(a),  which  shows  a  smallg  

indeed gives a better R  and  R  scales logarithmically ong . We note that Smith et. al. 

argued  that

that  the  relation

achieved  through  such  lenses.  We  find  Rt

to  exponentially  depend  on R and  that  a

criteria,  the  exponential  relation  holds  with  similar  exponents.  Combining  Fig.  4(a)

and the power law component a  is quite 

close  to  -1.  This  is  not  a  coincidence  but  is  mandated  by  the  underlying  physical 

mechanism. In fact, the transient process can be viewed as the dissipations of transient 

waves  with  frequencies  other  than  the  desired  one.  While  the  propagating  transient 

waves  leak  away  quickly,  the  evanescent  components  are  dissipated  mainly  through 

absorption [21]. Thus, all physical quantities relax to their stabilized values in a way

In summary, we identified the existence of a novel vortex-like surface mode in a slab 

of  negative  index  systems,  and  found  that  this  surface  wave  will  inevitably  lead  to 

imaging oscillations. The transient effect has a strong dependence on dimensionality. 

We  offered  a  complete  picture  for the transient  wave  physics  of  super  lens  focusing 

via  establishing  relationships  among  resolution,  absorption,  and  the  relaxation  time. 

All results were obtained within a mathematically rigorous approach.

are  rather  intriguing.  See  S.  Foteinopoulou,  E.  N.  Economou  and  C.  M.  Soukoulis, 

Phys. Rev. Lett. 90 107402 (2003). 

[16] We take this simple form to explore the governing physics only and believe the 

main  conclusions  will  not  be  affected  by  the  detail  structure  of  the  source  and  the 

exact switching-on process.

University, Princeton, New Jersey, 1995). 

[21] The evanescent waves can also be dissipated by SW  lateral transport. However, 

the SW group velocity approaches zero near the working  frequency (see Fig. 2 for a 

clearer understanding) so that the dissipation through lateral transport is much slower 

than through absorption for this kind of systems.

This  work  is  concerned  with  the  experimental  demonstration  of  a  dual-band  negative  index  metamate-
rial. The sample is double-negative (showing both a negative effective permeability and a negative effec-
tive permittivity) for wavelengths between 799 and 818 nm of linearly polarized light with a real part of 
refractive index of about −1.0 at 813 nm; the ratio −Re(n)/Im(n) is close to 1.3 at that wavelength. For an 
orthogonal polarization, the same sample also exhibits a negative refractive index in the visible (at 772 
nm).  The  spectroscopic  measurements  of  the  material  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  results  obtained 
from a finite element electromagnetic solver for the actual geometry of the fabricated sample at both po-
larizations.

The refractive index ( n
= +
n
) is the key parame-
ter  in  the  interaction  of  light  with  matter.  Normally 
n ′   has  been  considered  to  be  positive,  but  the  condi-
n ′ <  does not violate any fundamental physical 
tion 
law.  Negative  index  metamaterials  (NIMs)  with 
n ′ <   have  some  remarkable  properties,  which  are 
critical  for  a  number  of  potential  applications.  Typi-
cally,  a  NIM  is  an  artificially  engineered  metal-
n ′ <  within a cer-
dielectric composite that exhibits 
tain  range  of  wavelengths.  A  magnetic  response 
should  be  observed  in  the  NIMs  within  this  range, 
since  this  is  required  to  make  the  real  part  of  the  ef-
fective  refractive  index  negative.  It  can  be  accom-
plished either through the strong (sufficient) condition 
μ′ <   and 
ε′ < ,  or  through  a  more  general 
0
that 
0
< .  The  latter  con-
(necessary)  condition 
n ′ <  in a 
0
dition strictly implies that there cannot be 
passive metamaterial with 
 
As follows from the above conditions, two types 
of  NIMs  can  be  introduced.  A  double  negative  NIM 
(DN-NIM), is a material with simultaneously negative 
real parts of its effective permeability and permittivity 
μ′ < ). A single negative NIM (SN-NIM) 
ε′ <  and 
0
(
has  a  negative  refractive  index  with  either  ε′   or  μ′  
(but  not  both)  being  negative.  In  all  the  optical  SN-
NIM known to date, the real part of the permittivity is 
negative,  whereas  the  real  part  of  permeability  is 
μ′ > ).  At  optical  wavelengths

low-loss NIMs are desired. The FOM can be rewritten

Substantial progress has been achieved recently 
in  the  field  of  NIMs.  The  first  experimental  demon-
stration was given in 2001 at microwave frequencies.1 
The  first  NIMs  in  the  optical  range  were  demon-
strated in 2005 at 1.5 μm (Ref. [2]) and 2 μm.3 In both 
cases  it  was  a  SN-NIM  with  a  FOM  of  about  0.1  and

substantially in 2006; the first DN-NIM in the optical 
range  was  demonstrated  at  1.4 μm  with  a  FOM  of 
about three4 and at 1.8 μm with a FOM above 1.5 Most 
recently,  the  negative  refractive  index  was  pushed 
into  the  visible  with  the  demonstration  of  a  negative 
index  at  780 nm.6  This  was  a  SN-NIM  with  a  maxi-
mum FOM of about 0.5. In this paper we present the 
results  for  a  DN-NIM  at  the  shortest  wavelength  to 
date.  The  DN-NIM  has  a  maximum  FOM  of  1.3  at  a 
wavelength of 813 nm. In addition, the same structure 
exhibits  SN-NIM  behavior  at  772 nm,  thus  showing 
negative  n ′  at today’s lowest visible wavelengths. 
 
It  has  been  previously  shown3,7,8  that  a  sub-
wavelength bi-periodic cross-grating, consisting of two 
perforated  thin  metal  layers  separated  by  a  thin  di-
electric, is a good design prototype for NIMs. This de-
sign was used for the initial optimization. The sample 
was  fabricated  using  E-beam  lithography  followed  by 
E-beam  evaporation  and  lift-off.  The  structure  was 
fabricated on ITO (Indium tin oxide) coated glass sub-
strate. The ITO layer was 15 nm thick. Fig. 1a depicts 
a  FE-SEM  image  of  our  structure,  which  is  made  of 
two  33-nm  layers  of  perforated  silver  separated  by  a 
38-nm  layer  of  alumina.  The  lattice  constant  of  the 
structure is 300 nm in both lateral directions. A 10 nm 
thick layer of alumina was deposited on top and below 
the  structure  to  protect  the  silver  layer  from  deterio-
ration and improve adhesion to the substrate. 
 
We first  consider  the  double-negative  regime of 
the  structure.  Fig. 1a  depicts  the  “primary”  polariza-
tion  of  incident  light  capable  of  creating  the  double-
negative regime. The incident magnetic field is polar-
ized along the set of wider parallel strips. These ‘mag-
netic  strips’  are  schematically  shown  in  Fig.  1a  as 
darker  strips  on  top  of  the  FE-SEM  background  im-
age. The magnetic strips of the upper and lower layer 
are  coupled  at  the  magnetic  resonance;  in  the  opti-
mized design the magnetic resonance should be suffi-
ciently strong resulting in negative values for effective 
permeability. The other set of parallel strips is aligned 
with  the  incident  electric  field  and  shows  no  diffrac-
tion  (since  the  period  is  subwavelength).  The  ‘electric 
strips’  are  also  schematically  shown  as  lighter  strips 
in  Fig. 1a.  Similar  to  the  approach  discussed  in  Ref.

[9],  the  electric  strips  behave  like  a  “diluted  metal”, 
providing  a  controllable  broadband  negative  permit-
tivity. As a result, the structure can exhibit simultane-
ous  negative  permeability  and  permittivity,  demon-
strating a DN-NIM behavior. 
To validate the design, the sample was optically 
 
characterized  by  obtaining  its  transmittance  and  re-
flectance  spectra  using  normally  incident  light  sepa-
rately  at  both  the  primary  and  secondary  linear  po-
larizations. An ultra-stable tungsten lamp (B&W TEK 
BPS100)  was  used  as  a  light  source.  The  spectral 
range  of  the  lamp  covers  the  entire  visible  and  near-
infrared  optical  bands.  A  Glan  Taylor  prism  was 
placed  at  the  output  of  the  broadband  lamp  to  select 
light  with  a  given  linear  polarization.  The  signal 
transmitted  (or  reflected)  from  the  sample  was  intro-
duced into a spectrograph (Acton SpectraPro 300i) and 
finally collected by a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD-array 
detector.  The  data  were  normalized  to  a  bare  sub-
strate  (for  the  transmission  spectrum)  and  a  cali-
brated silver mirror (for the reflection spectrum). The 
measured  spectra  for  the  DN-NIM  regime  (primary 
polarization)  are  shown  in  Fig.  1b.  The  figure  com-
pares  optical  measurements  with  the  simulated  data 
obtained from commercial finite element 3D full-wave 
electromagnetic  solver  (COMSOL  MULTIPHYSICS)  using 
high-order  elements.  The  inset  in  Fig. 1a  shows  the 
unit  cell  of  the  simulated  structure,  where  the  sta-
lx =

)  follows  an  averaged 
geometry  obtained  in  fabrication.  In  simulations  the 
permittivity  of  silver  is  taken  from  experimental 
data,10  with  the  exception  that  ε′′   is  assumed  to  be 
three  times  that  of  bulk  silver.  This  extra  damping 
corresponds  to  the  additional  losses  in  the  silver  due 
to  imperfections  in  metallic  elements  and  metal-
dielectric  interfaces.  This  loss  correction  is  done  to 
match  the  experimental  spectra;  the  averaged  loss-
adjustment factor of 3 has been successfully validated 
experimentally in recent studies.3,6,11  
 
The experimental and simulated spectra shown 
in  Fig. 1b  demonstrate  a  good  match  over  a  broad 
range of measured wavelengths (from 500 to 950 nm) 
and include sharp resonant features: an electric reso-
nance  at  about  600  nm  and  a  magnetic  resonance 
close  to  800  nm.  Beyond  950  nm  signal  detection  is 
difficult due to a much lower signal-to-noise ratio.

Fig. 2a  depicts  the  “secondary”  linear  polariza-
tion,  which  is  orthogonal  to  the  primary  polarization 
of the incident light. In this case, the sample changes 
its  behavior  from  double-negative  to  single-negative. 
In contrast to the DN-NIM regime shown in Fig. 1a, at 
the secondary polarization the incident electric field is 
aligned  along  the  set  of  wider  parallel  strips.  These 
‘electric  strips’  are  schematically  indicated  in  Fig. 2a 
as  lighter  strips  over  the  FE-SEM  image.  The  other 
set of parallel strips is aligned with the incident mag-
netic field. The ‘magnetic strips’ are also schematically 
shown  in  Fig. 2a  as  darker  strips.  Note  that  in  the 
secondary  polarization  a  different  set  of  strips  of  the 
upper and lower layer is coupled at the magnetic reso-
nance.  
 
Experimental  and  simulated  spectra  for  the 
secondary  polarization  also  demonstrate  a  good 
match. A selected range of prime interest (around the 
magnetic  resonance  close  to  770 nm)  is  shown  in 
Fig. 2b. The unit cell and all optical constants used in 
the  numerical  simulations  at  the  secondary  polariza-
tion are identical to those used at the primary polari-
zation.  In  comparison  to  the  DN-NIM  regime,  the 
width  of  the  magnetic  strips  in  the  single-negative 
case  is  smaller  and  the  magnetic  resonance  is  blue-
shifted  to  770 nm.  In  addition,  the  resonance  is  not 
sufficiently  strong;  only  positive  values  for  the  effec-
tive permeability are obtained. This is confirmed by a 
much  higher  reflectance  (and  lower  transmittance) 
before  the  resonance  peak  in  absorbance  indicating 
that  the  structure  is  far  off  from  the  impedance-
matching  condition.  At  this  polarization  the  structure 
can  exhibit  only  SN-NIM  behavior  with  a  positive 
permeability, in addition to the fact that the real part 
of the effective permittivity becomes even more metal-
lic  due  to  the  wider  ‘electric’  strips. Furthermore,  the 
structure  can  demonstrate  dual-band  magnetic  re-
sponses at a linear polarization of 45 degrees. 
Figures 1b and 2b demonstrate good agreement 
 
between our spectroscopic measurements and numeri-
cal  simulations  obtained  in  a  wide  wavelength  range 
for  two  different  linear  polarizations.  This  is  a  good 
indication  of  the  validity  of  the  numerical  model, 
which  is  used  to  retrieve  the  effective  parameters  of 
the  equivalent  homogenized  layer.  The  effective  pa-
rameters  are  obtained  by  utilizing  an  extension  of  a 
standard  homogenization  technique12  shown  in  Ref. 
[8]  for  a  layer  on  a  glass  substrate.  In  this  approach 
the  thickness  of  the  equivalent  homogenized  layer  is 
equal to the physical thickness of the structure includ-
ing  the  ITO  layer  (
).  The  technique  uses 
the complex values of reflection and transmission coef-
ficients obtained either from the simulations or meas-

The magnetic resonance in periodic NIMs intro-

should  be  also  observed  within  the  electric  resonance 
band,  where  the  magnetic  anti-resonance  is  present.

ends  at  about  810  nm  with  the  value  of  ε′   decaying 
towards  longer  wavelengths  from  about  –2.0  to  –3.0. 
Similar  to  the  DN-NIM  case,  the  typical  periodicity 
effect  is  also  evident  in  Fig.  4b  through  the  anti-
resonant  behavior  of  ε′   at  the  magnetic  resonance

pending on the polarization of normally incident light,

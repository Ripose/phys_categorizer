The Einstein’s theories of space-time and gravity are reconstructed thoroughly in this paper based on 
flat  reference  frame.  The  rational  parts  of  the  Einstein’s  theories  are  reserved  while  the  irrational  parts 
including space-time paradoxes and singularities are eliminated.   

By  transforming  the  Schwarzschild  solution  of  the Einstein’s  equation of  gravitational  field  into  flat 
reference frame for description, the revised formulas of the Newtonian gravitation can be obtained. Based 
on  them,  all  experiments  which  support  general  relativity  can  also  be  described  well.  The  accelerating 
expansion of the universe can be deduced automatically from the formulas so that the hypothesis of black 
energy  becomes  unnecessary.  A  new  formula  of  gravitational  red  shift  and  the  revised  formula  of  the 
Doppler shift in gravitational can be obtained and the big red shifts of quasars can be explained well. The 
theory may also be used to explain so-called the Pioneer Anomaly which general relativity can not do. 

It is proved by means of the dynamical effects of special relativity that velocity caused by accelerating 

process should be an absolute concept, instead of a relative concept. The influence of accelerating process 

should  be  considered  in  space-time  theory.  Besides  the  Newtonian  absolute  space-time  theory  with 

invariable space-time scales and the Einstein’s relative space-time theory with variable space-time scales, 

there would exists the third space-time theory, i.e., the absolute space-time theory with variable space-time 

scales. In this way, theory of space-time can be consistent with the demand of the modern cosmology. 

At  present  we  only  prove  that  inertial  static  mass  and  gravitational  static  mass  are  equivalent  in  the

we can deduce a conclusion consequentially that inertial moving mass and gravitational moving mass are 

  type of experiments. By transforming the Schwarzschild solution into flat space-time to describe, 

equivalent. It can also be proved by means of the dynamic effect of special relativity that inertial forces and 

gravity  are  not  equivalent  locally  and  the  principle  of  general  relativity  is  actually  untenable.  By  the 

coordinate transformations of the Kerr and Kerr-Newman solutions, the solutions for the static distributions 

of  mass  loop  and  double  spheres  with  axial  symmetry  are  obtained.  The  results  indicate  that  space-time 

singularities  in  the  Einstein’s  theory  are  caused  actually  by  the  descriptive  method  based  on  curved 

space-time. All of these show that the Einstein’s theories of space-time and gravity should be revised. 

Similar to electromagnetic theory, by introducing magnetic-like gravitation, a more rational theory of 

gravitation  is  established  in  flat  space-time  without  any  singularity.  The  theory  may  be  consistent  with 

quantum mechanics and would be renormalizable after being quantized. So it can provide a really reliable 

foundation for the unity of four interaction forces.

Section 2    Rationality Problems of the Principles 
    of Equivalence and General Relativity 

   
1. Equivalent principle is not consistent with special relativity 

We point out at first that the equivalent principle is not consistent with special relativity. Einstein used 

the  reference  frame  of  rotational  desk  to  show  the  principle  of  equivalence  and  concluded  that  the 
1K   with radium 
space-time of gravitational field was curved. As shown in Fig. 2.1, suppose that the desk 
r   is at rest in beginning. Then let the desk turn around its center in a uniform angle speed  ω. According 
0K   would 
to length’s contraction in special relativity, observers on the resting reference frame of ground 
  owing to desk’s rotation, but the radium of 

find that the perimeter of desk becomes

desk would not contract for there is no motion in the direction of radium. Therefore, the radio of perimeter 
and  radium  would  be  less  than  π,  so  that  the  observers  on  the  ground  would  affirm  that  the  space  of 
rotating desk is non-Euclidean space.   

                     

Fig. 2.1                                            Fig. 2.2                                                Fig. 2.3 

textbooks of general relativity took a mistake here

The problem now is that what the observers resting on rotating desk think about. Einstein and almost 
( )7 . According to Einstein and the current textbooks, the 
rulers of observers on rotating desk would contract along the tangent direction of desc, but the perimeter of 

desk would not contract. So when observers on rotating desk used their rulers to measure the perimeter of 

desk, the perimeter becomes 

π
2

r

, longer than that observed on ground. But when they 

use  their  rulers  to  measure  the  radium  of  desk,  the  length  is  unchanged.  So  the  ratio  of  perimeter  and 
radium is big than  π  for observers on rotating desk. This result is obviously wrong, for it is based on the 
premises that desk is at rest and observer and his ruler move. But in this case, desk rotates actually so that 

the perimeter of desk and the rulers of observers contract synchronously. So the observers who are at rest 

2

     
     

   

   

 

on  desk  can  not  find  the  change  of  desk’s  perimeter  actually  by  using  their  rulers!  That  is  to  say,  the 

observers in curved space could not find space’s curvature actually if they only use their rulers to measure. 

It  involves  to  the  possibility  problem  of  measurements  in  curved  space-time  as  well  as  the  rationality 

problem that we compare directly the calculating results in curved space-time with the experiments carried 

out in flat space-time. We will discuss them again in Second 4. 

Secondly,  let’s  show  that  the  principle  of  equivalence  contradicts  with  the  concept  of  space-time 

reference frame 

So according to space-time relativity, for the observers resting on rotating desk, 

relativity, space-time’s contraction is caused by relative speed, which has nothing to do with acceleration

relativity. There are two problems here. The first is that according to the common understanding of special 
( )8 . 
1K   is at rest but ground 
1K   as shown in Fig. 2.2. In this way, the observers resting on desk 
would think that the rulers on their hands are unchanged so that they can not conclude that space-time of 
0K   should  be 
1K . Of course, this result can not be accepted. Therefore, if the concept 
of  space-time  relativity  holds,  we  can  not  conclude  that  the  space-time  of  gravitational  field  is  curved. 

desk  is  curved.  Instead,  they  would  think  that  the  space-time  of  ground  reference  frame 

0K   is rotating around 

0K   moves around 

curved for 

Conversely,  if  the  space-time  of  gravitational  field  is  curved  and  the  principle  of  equivalence  holds,  the 

principle of space-time relativity would be violated.   

The second problem is that in light of general recognition of special relativity, space-time contract is a 

purely  relative  effect,  having  nothing  to  do  with  acceleration.  But  according  to  the  equivalent  principle, 

space-time contraction should be relative to force and interaction, not a purely relative effect. 

It  is  obvious  that  the  principle  of  equivalence  contradicts  with  the  principle  of  space-time  relativity. 

Because the principle of equivalence is regarded as the foundation of the Einstein’s theory of gravitation, it 

can be said that special relativity is not consistent with the Einstein’s theory of gravity. Only way for us to 

get rid of this paradox is to give up the relativity of space-time and admit that space-time contraction is a 

kind of effect caused by accelerating processes. The rational result should be that the perimeter of rotating 
desk  contracts  and  the  radio  of  perimeter  and  radium  is  less  than  π.  No  matter  the  observers  are  on 
rotating  desk  or  on  ground,  they  viewpoints  are  the  same.  Only  in  this  way,  we  can  each  a  logically 

consistent theory of space-time and gravitation. 

   
2. Inertial moving mass and gravitational moving mass are nonequivalent   

Let’s discuss the problem of equivalent principle itself. The principle can be divided two parts, one is 

weak  equivalent  principle  and  another  is  strong  equivalent  principle.  The  weak  equivalent  principle 

indicates  that  gravitational  mass  is  equivalent  with  inertial  mass,  or  gravity  is  equivalent  to  inertial  force 

locally.  We  first  discuss  the  equivalence  of  gravitational  mass  and  inertial  mass.  Then  discuss  the 

equivalence of gravity and inertial force, as well as the relation between curved space-time in gravitational 

field  and  non-inertial  reference  frame  and  so  do.  It  will  be  shown  by  considering  the  dynamic  effects  of 

special relativity that the principle of equivalence is impossible actually.   

At present, the experiments to prove the equivalence between inertial mass and gravitational mass is 

the  so-called

  type  of  experiments.  It  should  be  pointed  out  that  this  type  of  experiments  only 

prove  the  equivalence  between  inertial  static  mass  and  gravitational  static  mass,  but  can  not  be  used  to 

prove  the  equivalence  of  inertial  moving  mass  and  gravitational  moving  mass  actually.  According  to  the

also be a constant. This result has an obvious defect, i.e., the object’s speed would surpass light’s speed in 

vacuum  at  last  when  the  object  falls  in  the  gravitational  field.  In  order  avoid  this  problem,  the  dynamic 

relation of special relativity should be considered. We have

  types  only  verify  the  equivalence  between  gravitational  static  mass 

and inertial static mass, without verifying the equivalence between gravitational moving mass and inertial 

moving mass. The relation between them will be deduced in Section 4, showing that gravitational moving 

mass and inertial moving mass are nonequivalent.   

On  the  other  hand,  the  weak  principle  of  equivalence  can  also  be  described  as  that  gravitation  is 

locally  equivalent  with  inertial  force.  Besides  rotating desk,  Einstein  used  the  ideal experiment  of  closed 

chamber  to  show  the  equivalence.  In  the  experiments,  observers  in  a  closed  chamber  could  not  decide 

whether  they  were  at  rest  in  a  uniform  gravitational  field,  or  were  being  accelerated  with  a  uniform 

acceleration.  This  result  is  correct  in  the  Newtonian  theory,  but  can  be  proved  to  be  incorrect  after  the 
dynamic  effect  of  relativity  is  considered.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2.4,  suppose  that  the  chamber  K′   is 

 

4

0m   is hanged 
accelerated relative to resting reference frame  K . There is an object  A   with static mass 
on  the  ceiling  of  chamber  through  an  elastic  rope.  When  K′   is  accelerated  in  a  uniform  acceleration, 
owing to the dynamic effect of special relativity as shown in Eq.(2.2), the inertial moving mass of object 

would  become  bigger  and  bigger.  So  the  rope  would  be  pulled  longer  and  longer  besides  the  Lorentz 

contraction.  When  the  speed  of  chamber  is  great  enough,  the  inertial  force  of  object  would  surpass  the 

bearing capacity so that the rope would be pulled apart. Because the breaking of rope is an absolute event, 

observers who are inside and outside chamber would observe it. The observers inside the chamber would 

affirm that they are accelerated, instead of resting at a static gravitational field. If the closed chamber was at 

rest  in  a  static  gravitational  field,  the  rope  would  not  be  pulled  longer  and  longer, and  break  at  last.  It  is 

obvious  that  the  equivalence  between  gravitation  and  inertial  force  is  only  tenable  in  the  Newtonian 

mechanics. After the dynamic effect of special relativity is considered, gravitation and inertial force are not 

equivalent locally in general.   

   

   

 

                                Fig. 2.4    Non-equivalence between gravitation and inertial force 

 

Besides, there are many other experiments to show the impossibility of weak equivalent principle. For 

example, when a closed chamber is at rest on a uniformly rotating desk, there exists the Coriolis force for a 

moving object, the inertial gyroscope would change its direction and charged objects would radiate photons. 

But  in  a  static  gravitational  field,  there  are  no  such  phenomena.  Observers  can  distinguish  both  to  be  on 

rotating desk or at rest in a uniform gravitational field by theses phenomena. The results above show that it 

is improper to take the principle of weak equivalence as a fundamental principle of physics. 

     
3. Equivalence of space-time bending between non-inertial frame and gravitational field   
The  equivalent  problem  of  space-time  bending  between  non-inertial  frame  and  gravitational  field  is 

discussed below. At present, the time delay of gravitational field is considered as the result of equivalent 

principle, having nothing to do with the equation of gravitational field. Einstein used the ideal experiment 

of  rotating  desk  to  shown  that  the  space-time  of  gravitational  field  was  curved  based  on  equivalent 

principle. We now discuss this problem. Because the clocks on rotating desk have velocities, clock’s times 

on  the  desk  would  become  slow.  The  relation  between  centripetal  acceleration  and  the  speed  of 

circumference motion is

Here  dt   is the time of clocks on rotating desk, 
0dt   is the time of clocks on static ground. According to 
the  principle  of  equivalence,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2.2.,  the  reference  frame  of  uniformly  rotating  desk  is 
equivalent  with  a  static  gravitational  field  which  does  not  change  with  time.  In  the  figure,  F   is  the

centripetal force acting on clock,  F′   is inertial force. The equilibrium of two forces keeps the clock at rest 
on  the  desk.  According  to  the  equivalent  principle,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2.3,  F   should  be  regarded  as  a 
certain force just as a frictional force. This force balances gravitation  G   so that the clock can be at rest in 
gravitational field without falling down. So as long as the equivalent principle is tenable, the time would 

become slow for a clock at rest in a gravitational field. Because rotating desk can be regarded as a system 
F

with centripetal force, the force acted on the object at rest in the force field can be written as

The  result  is  different  from  Eq.(2.8).  It  indicates  that  moving  in  the  same  centripetal  field,  time  delay  is 

relative to the forms of motions. But there is no distinction in the different situations in general relativity. 

The time delay is always represented by Eq.(2.10) by taking 

k =

GM

. 

In  the  60’s  last  century,  time  delay  based  on  Eq.(2.10)  was  verified  by  the  experiments  of  atomic 

cesium  clocks  circling  the  earth.  The  red  shift  of  spectrum  also  verified  the  correction  of  Eq.  Eq.(2.10). 

Now  these  experiments  are  considered  as  the  proof  that  the  existence  of  gravitational  field  would  cause 

time delay. However, in the experiment of atomic cesium clocks circling the earth,  clocks moved around 

the earth, in spite of moving along the radium direction of the earth. According to the equivalent principle, 

time delay should obey Eq.(2.8), in spite of Eq.(2.10).   

Because time process is determined by the frequency of atomic libration, the fact that the frequency of 

atomic  libration  becomes  slow  means  that  time  process  becomes  slow.  It  can  be  said  that  the  hypothesis 

that gravitation would cause time slow has been verified by the experiments of spectrum red shift of and 

atomic cesium clocks circling the earth. Because time delay shown in Eq.(2.10) is not a quantity which can 

be measured directly, only by the indirect experiments just as the red shift of spectrum, we can decided it. 

At  present,  all  experiments  about  it  are  carried  out  in  weak  fields  of  gravitation,  it  is  still  be  worth  of 

suspicion  that  if  the  formula  would  be  correct  in  strong fields.  In  the  forth  section  of  this  paper,  we  will 

provide a more rational formula about the effect of gravitation on the atomic libration or light’s frequency 

based on the description of gravity in flat space-time. The big red shift of quasars can be explained well by 

Then let’s discuss the problem of space bending based on the equivalent principle. According to the 
( )7    

current theory, when the angle speed of rotating desk is  ω, the space metric of desk can be written as

It means that length contraction takes place along the tangent direction of desk. Because there is no speed 

along  the  radium  direction,  there  exists  no  length  contraction  along  this  direction.  On  the  other  hand, 

according  to  the  sphere  symmetrical  solution  of  the  Einstein’s  equation  of  gravity,  the  space  part  of

Because the slice of sphere is just the desk, so the space bending in both situations should be the same. 

In fact, we can let 

in Eq.(2.11) for the thin desk and can let 

0=dz

2/πθ=

  and 

0=θd

  in Eq. (2.12) 

for the slice of sphere. In this case, Eqs.(2.11) and (2.12) should describe the same space metric. However, 

we  can  see  that Eqs.(2.11)  and  (2.12) are  not  consistent  in  this  case.  In  the  Schwarzschild  metric,  length 

contraction takes place in the direction of radium, which is just the acting direction of gravitation. But in 

the  metric  of  rotating  desk  shown  in  Eq.(2.11),  length  contraction  takes  place  in  the  tangent  direction  of 

desk, instead of the direction of inertial force. It indicates that space bending caused by non-inertial force 

may  be  different  from  that  caused  by  gravitation,  if  gravitational  fields  would  also  cause  space  bending 

really.  Unfortunately,  this  obvious  difference  has  not  caused  person’s  attention  up  to  now.  When  a 

non-inertial frame moves around a center, the centripetal acceleration can be written as

Eq.(2.14)  coincides  with  Eq.  (2.12),  but  not  with  Eq.(2.13).  So according  to  the  equivalent  principle,  the 

space  scalar  of  a  reference  frame  at  rest  in  gravitational  field  should  be  equivalent  with  the  non-inertial 

reference frame which moves along the radium direction of centripetal force, in spite of that moves around 

the centripetal point.   

        In fact, we lack of direct proofs to prove that gravity would cause space bending. What we have now 

is only indirect proofs. We only prove it by calculating object’s motions in the gravitational field of the sun 

and can obtain more accurate results. The result is equal to object’s motions in curved space-time. But all of 

them  are  indirect  proofs.  This  is  different  from  time  delay  in  gravitational  field,  though  as  shown  in  the 

later discussion in this paper, time delay in gravitational field can be deduced by a different method, in spite 

of the equivalent principle. So it is unproved that gravitation would cause space bending. In fact, we can 

establish  gravitational  theory  in  flat  reference  frame  without  introducing  the  hypothesis  that  gravitation 

would cause space bending. Though the Einstein’s theory of gravity has obtained great successes, too many 

space-time singularities appear in the theory. Within the singular region, all physical laws lose efficacy so 

that  we  can  not  research  their  natures.  The  essential  reason  is  owing  to  that  the  theory  is  established  in 

curved space-time.  If gravitational theory can be established in flat space-time, owing to the fact that the 

space-time curvature is always zero, we have no any singularity problem again.

But there exists a basic logical problem here. According to general relativity, particle moves along the 

geodesic line in gravitational field without the action of force. So there exists no the concept of potential 

for a photon moving in gravitational field and photon’s energy can be written as 

E =

hv

. Suppose that 

photon’s  energy  is  unchanged  in  gravitational  field,  the  wave  length  and  frequency  of  photon  would  be 
,  its  wave  and  frequency  would  still  be  λ

  in  light  of  Eq.(4.15).  But  this  is 
ν   in Eq.(4.15) as the wave length of light emitted by free

coming from gravitational field with that emitted by free atom outsider gravitational field. It means that 

the wave length of light coming from gravitational field is purple shift, in spite of red shift.   

So in order to coincide with experiments, photon’s frequency  ν  in gravitational field would not be 
a constant. It means that the law of energy conservation is violated for photon moving in gravitational field. 

But  it  is  difficult  for  us  to  accept  this  idea.  Despite  of  this  difficulty,  if  we  suppose  that  photon’s  energy 

would  change  when  it  moves  in  gravitational  field,  its  wave  length  and  frequency  would  change.  If  we

The result is that we observe purple shift, In spite of red shift. So based on the equivalent principle of time 

in  general  relativity,  we  can  not  explain  gravitational  red  shift  of  spectrum,  no  matter  whether  photon’s 

energy  is  conservative  or  not,  no  matter  whether  photon’s  wave  length  and  frequency  change  or  not  in 

gravitational field.   

can be written as 

In order to explain the gravitational red shift of spectrum rationally in logic, a possible method would 

be that photon’s energy is supposed only relative to its dynamic energy with

field.  It  will  be  proved  in  section  4  that  photon  would  be  acted  by  repulsive  force  when  it  moves  in

explained  well  without  any  logical  contradiction.  It  also  means  that  atomic  libration  would  change  in 

gravitational  field  with  speed 

V

gravitational  field.  If  we  use  atomic  clock  to  determine  time,  it  also  means  that  time  becomes  slow  in 

gravitational field. Besides, a new red shift formula of gravitation and the revised Doppler formula of shift 

in  gravitational  field  can  be  deduced  so  that  the  big  red  shift  of  quasar  can  be  explained  well.  However, 

according to general relativity, photon is not acted by force in gravitational field. So there is no potential 

concept.  This  kind  explanation  of  gravitational  red  shift  does  not  coincide  with  general  relativity  in 

fundamental concept, but it is really effective.   

   
5. Impossibility of the principles of strong equivalence and general relativity 
        The  strong  equivalent  principle  affirms  as  that  by  taking  the  local  inertial  reference  frame  at  any 

space-time point in a gravitational field, the forms of nature laws are the same as they are in the reference 

frames  in  which  the  Descartes  reference  frame  is  taken  without  gravitational  field  and  acceleration.  Or 

speaking  directly,  in  a  local  reference  frame  which  is  falling  freely  in  a  gravitational  field,  gravitation 

would  be  eliminated.  This  seems  to  be  a  well-known  experimental  fact.  Then,  is  the  strong  equivalent 

principle  tenable?  The  following  analysis  shows  that  this  is  only  an  apparent  feeling  of  mankind  and 

untenable actually.   

In order to explain this result, we need to establish the concepts of “uniform force” and “non-uniform 

force”. So-called “uniform force” indicates that the force acted on an object is distributed uniformly over 

all parts of the object. “Non- uniform force” indicates that the force is only acted on a part of the object. It 

is  obvious  that  gravitation  is  “uniform  force”,  but  the  force  acted  on  an  observer  who  is  at  rest  in 

non-inertial reference frame is non- uniform force. For example, when an observer stands on an accelerated 

train,  the  force  acted  on  him  actually  acts  on  his  feet  and  the  feet  draw  the  body  of  observer  moving 

forward. The other parts of body, not being acted directly by the force, are still in internal state, so that the 

body  moves  backward.  In  this  way,  the  so-called  inertial  force  is  caused.  In  an  accelerating  elevator,  the 

force is also only acted on observer’s feet directly. Then the force is contributed to whole body through feet. 

For observers on rotating desk, friction force between feet and desk is need so that the observer can stand 

on desk. The friction force is also acted on feet directly. All of these forces are non-integral forces. It is just 

 

9

owing  to  the  action  of  the  non-uniform  force,  non-equilibrium  or  internal  stress  is  caused  in  observer’s 

body  so  that  observer  can  feel  the  existence  of  accelerating  motion.  It  should  be  pointed  out  that 

“non-uniform force” is only a macro-concept. The essence of “non-uniform force”, such as friction force, is 

electromagnetic  force.  From  micro-angle,  however,  all  interactions  between  micro-particles  are  uniform 

force. 

It is clear that the force acted on an object in uniform gravitational field is uniform force. The inertial 

force caused by non-inertial motion is also uniform force in general. The problem is now that when a non- 

uniform force is distributed over whole body of observer who is at rest in a non-inertial reference frame, 

what  would  happen?  As  shown  in  Fig.  2.1,  the  centripetal  force  acted  on  the  feet  of  observer  at  rest  on 

rotating desk is friction force actually. If this friction force is distributed over each part of observer’s body, 

the  observer  would  not  fell  this  force’s  action.  We  can  see  in  Fig  .2.2  from  the  angle  of  non-inertial 

reference frame, this uniform friction force would be counteracted by the uniform inertial force. In this case, 

the observer who is at rest on rotating desk seems to be at rest in a static inertial reference frame without 

any  force’s  action,  though  he  is  actually  accelerated.  He  may  also  think  that  he  himself  is  falling  in  a 

gravitational field, just as an astronaut travels in the orbit of cincturing earth. 

So it is only a subjective feeling that observer was not acted by force when he fell freely in a uniform 

gravitational field. The true is that the force acted on observer’s body is uniform force which is distributed 

over observer’s body uniformly. In this way, no internal stress is produced in observer’s body so that he can 

not fell the action of gravitational force and the existence of acceleration. Physiology tells us that felling is 

caused by non-uniformity. No felling does not indicate no changing. If changing is uniform and slow, there 

would  be  no  felling.  If  proper  methods  are  used,  surpassing  subjective  felling,  the  observer  would  find 

himself to be being accelerated when he falls freely in a uniform gravitational field. For example, a charged 

object would radiate photons when it falls freely in a gravitational field, but the object would not when it is 

at  rest  in  inertial  reference  frame.  So  only  by  taking  a  charged  object  with  himself,  the  observer  would 

judge whether he is falling freely in a uniform gravitational field or at rest in inertial reference frame. Only 

by  this  fact,  the  principle  of  strong  equivalence  has  been  proved  untenable.  More  important  is  that  by 

comparing with static inertial reference frame, moving ruler’s length would contract, moving clock’s time 

would  become  slow  and  moving  object’s  mass  would  increase  absolutely.  The  forms  of  nature  laws  are 

different  for  both  the  freely  falling  reference  frames  in  gravitational  fields  and  the  Descartes  inertial 

reference frame. 

Einstein  denied  the  existence  of  absolutely  resting  reference  frame  by  means  of  establishing  special 

relativity.  In  special  relativity,  all  inertial  reference  frames  were  considered  to  be  equivalent  for  the 

description  of  nature  phenomena.  After  that,  he  introduced  the  principle  of  general  relativity  again  to 

eliminate the superiority of inertial reference frame. In general relativity, all reference frames with arbitrary 

moving forms were considered to be equivalent for the description of nature phenomena. In mathematics, 

the principle of general relativity can be described as that the basic forms of  motion equations should be 

covariant,  or  the  line  element  of  arbitrary  reference  frames  must  satisfy  relation 

=2ds

constant.  This 

demand is rational, for it actually indicates that light’ speed in vacuum is still invariable under the condition 

of non-inertial coordinate transformations. But it does not mean that the forms of forces acted on objects 

are  the  same.  As  we  known,  in  the  common  three  dimension  space,  the  motion  equations  can  be 

transformed  into  other  forms  by  introducing  arbitrary  coordinate  transformations  without  bring  any 

physical  effect,  for  there  are  no  any  force  or  acceleration  is  introduced  in  this  case.  But  in  the  four 

dimension  space-time,  the  situation  is  completely  different.  In  the  four  dimension  space-time,  if  the 

 

10

transformation  is  linear  just  as  the  Lorenz  transformation,  a  uniform  velocity,  instead  of  force  or 

acceleration,  would  be  introduced.  But  if  the  transformations  are  arbitrary,  accelerations  or  non-inertial 

forces  would  be  introduced in  motion  equations.  In  this  way,  there  still  exists  a  superior  reference  frame 

actually,  i.e.,  inertial  reference  frame.  In  inertial  reference  frames,  the  forms  of  motion  equations  are 

simplest without the existence of inertial force. 

In  the  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravity,  non-inertial  motions  are  considered  to  be  equal  to  gravitational 

fields.  At  present,  based  on  the  principle  of  general  relativity,  it  is  thought  that  when  the  coordinate 

transformation  is  carried  out  for  a  solution  of  gravitational  field’s  equation,  the  solution  with  new  form 

would  still  be  effective  to  describe  the  original  gravitational  field.  However,  this  is  impossible.  If 

non-inertial  reference  frame  is  equal  to  gravitational  field,  a  special  non-inertial  reference  frame  can  be 

only  equal  to  a  special  gravitational  field.  So  when  a  non-inertial  reference  frame  is  transformed  into 

another,  it  means  that  a  gravitational  field  is  transformed  into  another  one  with  different  nature. Because 

inertial forces are considered to be equal to gravities, the general transformation in the space-time of four 

dimensions  would  change  gravitational  fields.  For  a  certain  gravitational  field,  if  the  coordinate 

transformation is carried out, the form of field’s equation and the solution would change. The result means 

that  the  original  field  has  been  transformed  into  new  gravitational  field,  and  new  solution  would  not  be 

original one. So a certain gravitational field can only correspond to a certain metric. Arbitrary coordinate 

transformation in the four dimension’s space-time is not allowed, unless in new reference frame the same 

result  can  be  obtained.  However,  this  is  impossible  in  general.  For  example,  we  can  not  re-calculate  the 

perihelion precession of Mercury as well as other problems in the Lemaite or Kruskal coordinate systems 

and  get  the  same  result  as  we  do  in  the  Schwarzschild  coordinate  system.  In  fact,  the  reason  why  the 

energy-momentum tensors of gravitational field can not be defined well at present is actually owing to the 

existence  of  strong  equivalent  principle.  According  to  the  principle,  we  can  introduce  same  local  inertial 

reference frames through coordinate transformations, in which gravitational fields would be eliminated and 

the  energy-momentum  tensors  of  gravitational  fields  become  zero.  However,  according  to  the  law  of 

energy-momentum  conservation,  a  static  system’s  energy  and  momentum  should  be  constants.  How  can 

they be canceled only by coordinate transformations?   

Therefore, it can be said that no relativity and arbitrarily are allowed in the description of gravity. The 

description of gravitational theory demands absolution. The principle of general relativity is untenable. The 

demand that the forms of motion equations should be covariant in arbitrary reference frames is only a basic 

restriction for the transformations of motion equations. It does not indicate that the descriptions of physical 

processes  are  the  same  in  arbitrary  reference  frames.  In  fact,  only  in  inertial  reference  frames,  the  basic 

forms of motion equations can be the same. And as mentioned in Section 1, only in the absolutely resting 

reference frame, the descriptions of physical processes are the simplest and most symmetrical.   

At last, we should point out that a free falling of reference frame in gravitational field only means that 

the reference frame is accelerated. The force acted on the reference frame is only  special one---- gravity. 

The  result  is  that  relative  to  resting  reference  frame,  in  the  accelerated  reference  frame,  length  would 

contract  and  time  would  delay  and  mass  would  increase.  All  of  those  are  the  normal  effects  of  special 

relativity. Therefore, as long as we know the interaction form between gravitational field and material, we 

can  describe  object’s  motion  in  gravitational  field  by  the  dynamic  method  of  special  relativity.  The 

description is in flat space-time as shown in Section 4. 

It  is  obvious  that  though  the  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravity  has  reached  great  success,  there  are  many 

problems  existing  in  its  logical  foundation  and  theoretical  configuration.  We  should  renovate  our  ideas

about the essence of space-time and gravity. 

   

   

Section 3    Irrationality of the Axially Symmetrical Solutions 
    of the Einstein’s Equations of Gravitational Fields 

   
1. The static gravitational field of axial symmetry distribution of mass loop 

Though  the  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravity  obtained  great  success,  we  have  only  four  experiments  to 

verify for the simplest solution of gravitational fields with mass static spherical symmetry distribution up to 

now  actually.  Speaking  strictly,  we  only  prove  it  in  the  weak  gravitational  field  of  the  sum.  As  for  other 

solutions of the Einstein’s equations of gravitational fields, we can neither obtain experimental supports nor 

find  corresponding  physical  systems  for  them.  Facing  so  many  forms  of  material  distributions  and 

comparing  with  so  many  experimental  verifications  of  the  Newtonian  theory  of  gravity  and  quantum 

mechanics as well as special relativity, it is far not enough for the Einstein’s theory of gravity.   

By  means  of  the  coordinate  transformations  of  the  Kerr  solution  with  double  parameters  and  the 

Kerr-Newman  solution  with  three  parameters  of  the  Einstein’s  equation  of  gravitation  field  with  axial 

symmetry,  the  gravitational  field  equation’s  solutions  for  the  static  mass  distributions  of  thin  loop  and 

double spheres can be obtained. The results show that no matter what are the masses and densities of loop 

and double spheres, space’s curvatures in the centre points of loop and the double sphere’s connecting line 

are  infinite.  The  singularity  points  are  completely  exposed  in  vacuum  and  space  curvatures  nearby  the 

singularity  points  and  the  surface  of  loop  and  double  spheres  are  also  highly  curved  even  though  the 

gravitational fields are very weak. It is obvious that all of them are actually impossible. The results show 

that the space-time singularities appearing in the Einstein’s theory of gravity are not owing to high density 

and huge mass’s distributions. They are actually caused by the Einstein’s theory itself and have nothing to 

do with real world. The so-called black holes, white holes and wormholes with space-time singularity are 

something illusive, not existing in nature actually. All of these results indicate that the Einstein’s theory of 

gravity can not bet a universally suitable one. Physicists would be clear-headed for the Einstein’s theory of 

gravity. It is unadvisable for physicists to lose their judgment ability only by the great authority of Einstein 

and the beautiful form of the theory.     

The gravitational problem of mass thin loop distribution is discussed at first. As shown in Fig. 3.1, a 
thin  loop  with  mass  M   and  radium  b   is  placed  on  the  x-y  plane. The  centre  of  loop is  located  in  the 
original point of coordinate system. The loop is thin enough so that its cross section can be regarded zero 

comparing with its perimeter. It will be seen later that if the cross section of loop is not zero, the result is 

also the same in essence. Because the static mass distribution of thin loop is with axial symmetry, in light of 
the Einstein’s theory of gravity, the metric tensor of gravitational field has nothing to do with time  t   and

                      (3.2) 

Two  formulas  above  can  be  used  to  describe  the  gravitational  field  of  thin  loop.  By  putting  the  metrics 
above  into  the  Einstein’s  equation  of  gravitational  field,  we  can  obtain  the  concrete  forms  of  µνg   in 
principle. But it is difficult to solve the equation of gravitational fields directly based on Eq.(3.1) or (3.2). 
On the other hand, there are two independent parameters  M   and  b   for the axial symmetry distribution 
of thin loop. There is also a ready-made solution of gravitational field’s equation with axial symmetry and 

double parameters, i.e., the Kerr solution. If the solutions of the Einstein’s equations of gravitational fields 

are unique, we can obtain the solution of static mass distribution of thin loop by means of the coordinate 

transformations of the Kerr solution. We have no other selection besides it. This method is discussed below. 

The Kerr solution is

At present, the Kerr metric is regarded as the solution of a revolving sphere’s gravitational field，in which 
parameters 
).  As  for  the  static  mass 
  is  unit  angle  momentum  (
distribution  of  thin  loop,  the  meanings  of  parameters  αand  βare  discussed  below.  Because  the  metric 
(3.3)  contains  a  cross  item  ϕdtd   relative  to  time,  it  is  a  solution  of  dynamic  state.  In  the  static  mass 
distribution problem, this item does not exist. We can remove it by the diagonalization of metric tensors. 
Because only the items relative to  dt   and  ϕd   should be taken into account, we can let

The formula above has the form of Eq.(3.1), so it can be used to describe the gravitational field of static 

mass distribution of thin loop.   

On  the  other  hand,  as  we  known  that  only  by  comparing  with  the  Newtonian  theory  in  weak 

gravitational fields, the solution of the Einstein’s equation of gravitational field can determined, otherwise 

the integral constants can not be decided so that the solution is meaningless. According to this principle in 

the general theory of relativity, we have relation

So gravity at the center point is zero. This agrees with practical situation. Therefore, it should be noted that 

in order to decide the integral constants of the solutions of the Einstein’s equation of gravitational fields, we 

have to let the Einstein’s theory asymptotically coinciding with the Newtonian theory under the condition 

of weak fields with

∞→r

. Otherwise we can not compare the Einstein’s theory with the Newtonian one, 

so  that  we  can  not  determinate  the  validity  of  the  Einstein’s  gravity  theory.  But  in  the  problem  of  static 

axial symmetry distribution of thin loop mass, singularity appears at the center point of loop in vacuum so 

that  the  theory  becomes  meaningless.  On  the  region nearby  the  center  and  surface of  loop,  space-time  is 

high curved. All of these do not agree with practical situations.   

The  situation  when  the  cross  section  of  thin  loop  is  not  zero  is  discussed  below.  In  this  case,  the 

gravitation field is with three parameters. The third is the radium of loop’s cross section. On the other hand, 

 

18

as we known that the Kerr-Newman metric is one with axial symmetry and three parameters

)11 . At present, 
(
it  is  used  to  describe  the  external  gravitational  field  of  charged  revolving  sphere.    If  the  solution  of  the 

Einstein’s equation of gravitational field with three parameters and axial symmetry is unique, through the 

coordinate transformation from the Kerr-Newman metric, we can also reach the gravitational field of loop 

with cross section. By the same method of diagonalization , we can write the Kerr-Newman metric as

On  the  other  hand,  when  the  area  of  thin  loop’s  cross  section  is  considered,  the  function  form  of  the 

Newtonian  potential  is  very  complex.  We  can  get  the  same  conclusion  by  a  simple  estimate  without

2. The static gravitational field of axial symmetry distribution of double spheres 

The  static  gravitational  field  of  mass  double  sphere  is  discussed  below.  As  shown  in  Fig.  3.2,  the 
masses  and  radius  of  both  spheres  are  M   and  b   individually.  The  centers  of  two  spheres  are  at  the 
b±   of  the  z   axis.  The  gravitational  field  of  this  axial  symmetrical  distribution  with  two 
points 
parameters  can  also  be  obtained  through  the  coordinate  transformation  of  the  Kerr  solution.  For  this 

problem, the Newtonian potential of gravity is

unsuitable for the problem of double spherical mass distribution.   

In  fact,  there  are  many  other  axial  symmetry  distributions  of  static  masses  with  double  and  three 

parameters. For example, three spheres are superposed one by one in a line, two cones are superposed with 

their  cusps  meeting  together  and  hollow  column  and  so  do.  All  of  their  gravitational  fields  should  be 

obtained by means of the coordinate transformations of the Kerr and Kerr-Newman solutions in principle. 

But as shown above, the same problems would be caused.   

   
3. Discussion in general situations 

Therefore, we can conclude from discussions above 

1. If the axial symmetry solutions of the Einstein’s equations of gravitational fields with double and 

three parameters are unique, the gravitational fields of the static mass axial symmetry distributions of thin 

loop  and  double  spheres  should  be  obtained  by  the  coordinate  transformations  of  the  Kerr  and 

Kerr-Newman solutions. However, these solutions can not coincide with practical situations. Therefore, the 

Einstein’s  theory  of  gravity  can  not  be  a  universally  suitable  one.  If  the  axial  symmetry  solutions  of  the 

Einstein’s equations of gravitational fields with double and three parameters are not unique, i.e., there exist 

other solutions for the same Einstein’s equation which can describe these problems well (even though they 

have not be founded now), the uniqueness which is a basic demand for a universal physical theory would 

be destroyed. 

        2. A  great  number  of  theories  about  space-time  singularity,  black  holes,  white  holes  and  wormholes 

have  established  based  on  the  general  theory  of  relativity.  In  common  viewpoint,  these  objects  with 

space-time  singularity  are  caused  by  the  distributions  of  high  density  and  huge  masses.  However,  from 

discussions above, even for the systems of thin loop and two small spheres, singularities would also appear 

based on the Einstein’s theory of gravity. This fact shows that singularities are not caused actually by the 

high  density  and  huge  masses.  They  only  exist  in  the  Einstein’s  theory  actually,  not  in  nature.  The 

singularity  has  nothing  to  do  with  real  world.  So-called  black  holes,  white  holes  and  wormholes  with 

space-time singularity are actually illusive objects. This problem will be further discussed later. 

3.  As  well-known  that  only  by  comparing  with  the  Newtonian  theory  under  the  condition  of  weak 

fields,  the  solution  forms  of  the  Einstein’s  equations  of  gravitational  fields  can  be  finally  determined. 
According to the present method, under the condition of weak field, let  µνh   to be a small quantity with

Eq.(3.44). It means that the mass and energy’s distribution form of original system would be changed and 

the  original  solution  would  be  transformed  into  other  one  with  different  symmetry.  In  this  way,  the  new 

solution (3.48) is meaningless for the original problem we wand to discuss. This problem will be discussed 

again  in  next  paper,  for  it  involves  the  rationality  problem  of  the  principle  of  general  relativity.  Here  we

Comparing with the result of Newtonian theory according to Eq.(3.50), we should have

It is obvious that all metrics 

33g   in Eq.(4.49) can not be written as the forms of Eq.(3.42), 
so that we can not connect the Einstein’s theory with the Newtonian one, i.e., the Einstein’s theory can not 

22g   and 

00g , 

coincide  asymptotically  with  the  Newtonian  theory.  Because  we  can  not  establish  relations  between 
constants  G ,  ρ  and  a ,  b   and  c   so  that  the  constants  a ,  b   and  c   can  not  be  determined,  the 
solution (3.49) is meaningless actually for the problem of static mass line distribution. In fact, the Einstein’s 

theory  and  the  Newtonian  theory  are  two  completely  different  systems  with  completely  different  starting 

points.  It  is  impossible  for  them  to  reach  asymptotical  consistent  under  the  conditions  of  weak  fields  in 

general. 

The  common  procedure  to  obtain  the  solutions  of  the  Einstein’s  equation  of  gravity  is  firstly  to 

simplify the metrics based on some space-time symmetry, then to solve the equation. Up to now, a lot of 

solutions  have  been  founded.  But  many  of  them  are  considered  meaningless  in  physics  for  no  practical 

systems can be founded corresponding to them. However, the real situations may be that 

1.  Under  the  conditions  of  weak  fields,  the  solutions  of  the  Einstein’s  theory  can  not  asymptotical 

coincide  with  the  Newtonian  theory.  In  this  case,  the  integral  constants  in  the  solutions  of  the  Einstein’s 

equations  can  not  be  determined  so  that  we  can  say  that  the  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravity  is  actually 

unsuitable for these problems. 

2.  Though  the  solutions  of  the  Einstein’s  equations  of  gravitational  fields  can  coincide  with  the 

Newtonian theory in weak fields, but they are obviously irrational in general situations.   

At  present,  if  the  results  of the  Newtonian  theory  and  the  Einstein’s  theory  are  different,  we  always 

consider that the Newtonian theory is wrong. But should we ask whether the Einstein’s theory of gravity is 

alright? For weak gravitational fields, the Newtonian theory goes through so many verifications and can be 

considered  basically  correct.  For  the  same  problems  under  the  condition  of  weak  fields,  if  the  Einstein’s 

theory  can  not  asymptotically  coincide  with  the  Newtonian  theory,  how  can  we  always  say  that  the 

Einstein’s theory is wrong? Besides suspecting the correctness of the Einstein’s theory, we have no other 

outlet. It is not a scientific attitude when we find that the Einstein’s theory can not asymptotically coincide 

with  the  Newtonian  theory  for  a  certain  problem,  we  only  say  that  this  solution  of  Einstein’s  equation  is 

meaningless  in  physics  then  sent  it  away  randomly.  We  can  not  help  to  ask  that  if  these  solutions  are 

meaningless, where are the meaningful ones for the same problems?   

Up to new, only the Schwarzschild solution obtained four verifications actually. Speaking strictly, the 

solution was proved effective only in the weak gravitational field of the sun. The verifications are too littler 

comparing with the Newtonian theory of gravity, quantum  mechanics and special relativity. On the hand, 

under the condition of strong field, space-time singularity appears in the Schwarzschild solution. So it may 

be said that the correctness of the Schwarzschild solution is only a coincidence. It is unsuitable to regard 

the Einstein’s theory of gravity as a foundational theory  of interaction. As we know that though we need 

lots  of  proofs  to  verify  a  theory,  only  a  proof  can  overthrow  a  theory  sometimes.  Physicists  should  keep 

their brains clear for the Einstein’s theory of gravity. It is unadvisable for physicists to lose their judgment 

ability  only  by  the  great  authority  of  Einstein  and  the  beautiful  form  of  the  theory.  Physics  is  an 

experimental science to pursue reality. The beauty of format is not main aim. Besides the Einstein’s theory, 

there  are  many  other  theories  of  gravity  now.  But  most  of  them  are  established  based  on  the  concept  of 

curved space-time. Therefore, all of them are facing the same problems which exist in the Einstein’s theory. 

 

23

Owing to the problems mentioned in the paper, we should survey the rationality of the Einstein’s theory.   

Because in the weak gravitational field of the sun, the Einstein’s theory of gravity is the most simple 

and effective one, it would have some rationality. As shown in next paper, the spherical symmetry solution 

of the Einstein’s equation of gravity is transformed into flat space-time to describe. The results show that 

the experiments to support the general theory of relativity can also be explained. But the theory has no any 

singularity  in  strong  field.  Besides,  there  are  more  experiments  and  astronomic  observations  can  be 

rationally explained. Based on this result, a more rational theory of gravity can be established in the form 

of electromagnetic theory with the Lorentz invariability. In this way, the gravitational and electromagnetic 

interactions can be described in a consistent form. Similar to electromagnetic theory, this kind of theory of 

gravity is easy to quantization and normalization. The detail will be provided in next paper.

1. Impropriety of direct calculation and measurement in curved space-time 

According to the Einstein’s theory of gravity, the space-time of gravitational field is curved. But can 

we determine the curvature of space-time through the direct measurements of observers who are located in 

gravitational fields? The answer is no. This because that we should define standard rulers and clocks for the 

meaningful measurements. But standard rulers and clocks can not be defined in curved space-time, it only 

be done in flat space-time. If there are no the definitions of standard rulers and clocks, we can not establish 

the meaningful concepts of distances, angles and time intervals and so on with measurement significance. 

However, when we move the standard rulers and clocks defined in flat space-time into gravitational fields, 

the  rulers  and  clocks  would  become  “curved”  synchronously  so  that  we  can  not  use  them  to  measure 

space-time’s  curvature  of  gravitational  fields.  The  measurement’s  results  in  curved  space-time  are 

meaningless  in  practices  if  they  can  not  be  compared  with  that  in  flat  space-time.  On  the  other  hand, 

according  to  the  strong  principle  of  equivalence,  we  may  introduce  local  inertial  reference  frames  in 

gravitational fields in which standard rulers and clocks can be defined. But in local inertial reference frames, 

gravitational fields are considered to disappear. So even though we may define standard rulers and clocks in 

local inertial reference frames, they are useless. In fact, in the current calculations of gravitational problems 

based on general relativity, no standard rulers and clocks of the local inertial reference frames are used. We 

always calculate the problems directly in curved space-time.   

On the other hand, the gravitational field of the earth is quite weak so that it can be considered to be 

approximately  flat.  In  fact,  all  experimental  verifications  about  the  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravitation  are 

completed on the earth. So we should transform the theoretical predictions of general relativity calculated 

in curved space-time into that in flat space-time, then comparing the results with the experiments carried on 

the  earth.  Only  in  this  way,  we  can  say  that  the  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravitation  is  correct  or  wrong.  At 

present, all calculations of concrete problems in the Einstein’s theory of gravitation are carried out in the 

curved space-time. For example, the angles of the perihelion precession of the Mercury and the deviation of 

light in the solar gravitational field, the time intervals of delay effect of radar waves and so on, all of theses 

quantities  are  defined  in  curved  space-time.  Unfortunately,  these  calculation  results  in  curved  space-time 

are always compared directly with the experiments carried out on the earth without transforming them into 

the  results  of  flat  space-time  at  present.  Therefore,  it  is  improper  to  affirm  that  the  Einstein’s  theory  of 

 

24

gravity has been verified before we do them. Otherwise the judgment would be relaxed and trustless. This 

is a principle problem, but it is neglected completely at present.   

The  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravity  based  on  curved  space-time  has  become  the  mainstream  of 

gravitational  research.  But  there  exist  same  insurmountable  difficulties  in  it,  just  as  the  problems  of 

renormalization and singularity, the definition of gravitational field’s energy and so on. On the other hand, 

because  the  Einstein’s  equations  of  gravitational  fields  are  nonlinear,  the  idea  to  establish  the  theory  of 

gravity based on flat space-time is always attractive.    From the 1940’s, lots of persons tried to re-establish 
)14 . These theories are equivalent with the Einstein’s theory under 
(
the conditions of weak fields, but in general situations they are different. But at present, no experiments can 

the gravitational theory in flat space-time

prove  that  these  theories  are  superior  to  the  Einstein’s  theory.  So  in  light  of  common  viewpoint,  the 

space-time  of  gravitational  fields  should  be  described  by  non-Euclidean  geometry.  The  flat  space-time  is 

always regarded as the boundary condition far away from gravitational fields. 

On the other hand, according to the non-Euclidean geometry, the metrics of curved space-time can not 

be  transformed  into  that  of  flat  space-time  in  general,  otherwise  the  curved  space  would  not  be  the  real 

curved  one.  This  conclusion  seems  to  indicate  that  gravitational  fields  can  not  be  described  in  flat 

space-time.  However,  this  impossibility  only  means  that  we  can  not  transform  the  whole  metrics  of 

gravitational  fields  from  the  non-Euclidean  into  the  Euclidean.  But  we  can  always  transform  a  curve 

described in curved space into that described in flat space. In fact, only by observing the object’s motions in 

gravitational  fields,  we  can  comprehend  the  nature  of  gravitational  field’s  space-time.  According  to  the 

general theory of relativity, objects always move along the geodetic lines in gravitational fields. As long as 

we transform the geodetic lines defined in curved space-time into the curved lines or the motion equations 

defined in flat space-time, we can transform the theory of gravity described in curved space-time into that 

described  in  flat  space-time.  In  this  way,  we  can  compare  the  theoretical  predictions  based  on  curved 

space-time with the experiments carried out in flat space-time. It is unnecessary for us to transform whole 

curved space-time into flat space-time. 

   
2. The Schwarzschild solution described in flat space-time   

Now  let’s  discuss  how  to  transform  the  Schwarzschild  metric  of  the  Einstein’s  equation  of     

gravitational  field  into  flat  space-time  to  description.  According  to  the  general  theory  of  relativity,  the 

Schwarzschild metric of static mass distribution with spherical symmetry (external solution) is

Considering  τas the eigen time,  t   as the coordinate time and let

Thus, Eq.(4.4) becomes

Here  L   is  the  angel  momentum  of  unit  mass.  Eq.(4.6)  is  just  the  conservation  formula  of  angel 
momentum. Let’s first discuss the motions of particles with static masses. By using Eq.(4.6), Eq.(4.1) can

horizon can not move down continuously and then collapse at the center singularity of gravitational field 

after it reaches the event horizon. The results indicate that the event horizon is actually an attractive plane 

for  moving  particles.  The  particles  could  not  leave  the  event  horizon  along  both  up  and  down  directions 

after they had reached the event horizon. But this result is neglected in the current theory of black holes. 

According  to  the  current  understanding,  any  particles  would  move  towards  to  the  renter  of  gravitational 

field so that they would collapse at the center singularity at last. 

It  is  obvious  that  there  are  some  things  irrational  in  the  processes  of  particle’s  motions  in  the 

gravitational fields, besides the singularity of the event horizon. For example, some time the particle would 

be accelerated and some time it would be decelerated outside the event horizon. Especially particles would 

move  in  the  speeds  surpassing  light’s  speed  in  vacuum,  even  move  in  an  infinite  speed.  In  the  current 

theory, those problems are attributed to the improper selections of coordinates. In order to eliminate those 
)15 are 
(
introduced. In new coordinate systems, though the singularities on the event horizons may be eliminated, 

defects,  some  coordinate  systems  just  as  the  Eddington’s  and  the  Kruskal’s  coordinate  systems

they  can  not  yet  be  eliminated  at  the  original  point 

.  Hawking  etc.  even  proved  that  it  was 

0=r

impossible to eliminate all singularities in the general theory of relativity

)16 . 
(

However, as shown in former paper, it should be emphasized again that the arbitrary transformation in 

 

30

four  dimension  space-time  is  impossible  for  gravitational  problems.  This  kind  of  transformations  would 

introduce  arbitrary  inertial  forces,  and  the  inertial  forces  are  considered  to  equivalent  to  arbitrary 

gravitational fields. So after the transformations, the new gravitational fields are not equal to original ones. 

In  the  current  theories  of  black  holes,  in  order  to  eliminate  singularity  on  the  event  horizon,  the  freely 

falling Novikow or Lemaitre coordinates are introduced. Because there are no the event horizons, observers 

can  enter  the  event  horizons  without  any  felling.  After  that,  according  to  the  current  understanding,  they 

would be attracted into the center of black holes and be torn into the pieces by so-called tide forces at last. 

But in the Schwarzschild  coordinate, the observers would stop on the event horizon forever. However, the 

observer’s life and death are absolute events, what are observer’s fates?    In principle, we can find infinite 

coordinate systems in which the singularities on the event horizons can be eliminated. But none of theses 

metrics  are  with  spherical  symmetry  except  the  Schwarzschild  coordinate.  How  can  they  represent  the 

gravitational  field  with  spherical  symmetry?    On  the  other  hand,  in  the  curved  coordinate  systems,  no 

matter in the Novikow or Lemaitrewe coordinate systems, we can not define stander rulers and clocks. In 

theses curved coordinate systems, the speeds of clocks located at different places are not the same so that 

the  measurements  of  time  intervals  are  meaningless.  For  example,  we  say  that  an  observer  freely  falling 

down the gravitational field would spend infinite time to reach the event horizon. Because the clock’s speed 

in the moving reference frame changes continuously, what is the real meaning of infinite time?    Because 

only in the flat space-time we can define stander rulers and clocks, only in the flat reference frames outside 

the gravitational fields, the calculations and measurements for objects moving in the gravitational fields are 

meaningful. So the problems of gravitation should be transformed into the flat space-time for discussion.   

Now let’s discuss the motion of a particle in the gravitational field from the angle of observers in flat 

space-time  outside  gravitational  field.  Suppose  that  a  particle  falls  freely  along  the  radium  direction  of 

gravitational field, its velocity and acceleration are individually

,  the  motion  of  particles  with  static  masses  are  continuous.  Only  at  point 

0=r

,  the 

force acted on particles are infinite. But this infinite also appears in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, 

having  nothing  to  do  with  space-time  singularity.  When  a  particle  moves  along  the  positive  direction  of 

radius vector, as long as its velocity satisfies Eq.(4.39), the particle would escape gravitational field and has 

a  speed 

0=V

  when  it  reach  the  place 

.  That  is  to  say,  after  the  Schwarzschild  solution  is 

∞→r

transformed  into  flat  space-time  to  describe,  for  the  motion  of  particles  with  static  mass,  all  space-time 

singularities disappear. So it is obvious that singularities appearing in the Einstein’s theory of gravity are 

actually caused by the descriptive  method in curved space-time. As long as we describe the problems og 

gravitation in flat space-time, all singularities are canceled. The gravitational field itself has no singularities. 

In real and physical world, singularity is not allowed to exist.   

   
4. Photon’s motions in gravitational field with spherical symmetry   

The  motion  equation  of  photon  in  flat  space-time  is  discussed  as  follows.  For  photons,  we  have 
. In this case, we take dτ  as parameter to describe the equation of geodetic line. By  solving the

Einstein’s equation of gravity with spherical symmetry, we obtain

photons would stop at the event horizon. But from Eq.(4.54), it needs a infinite time for a photon to reach

It  means  that  the  particle  on  the  event  horizon  can  not  move  up  apart  from  the  event  horizon.  So  the 

particles could not leave the event horizon along both up and down directions after they had reached the 

event horizon. The event horizon is also an attractive plane for moving photons. 

Then let’s discuss how to describe photon’s motion in flat space-time. For photon’s motion, the metric 

in the flat space-time can be written as

The formula can be used to describe the deviation of light in the solar gravitational field. On the other hand, 

according to Eq.(4.50) and by taking approximation in weak field, we have

It is obvious that if the formula above is used to calculate, the correct conclusion can not be reached. This 

result means that when the Schwarzschild metric is transformed into flat space-time, we can not describe 

correctly the delay effect of radar wave in the sun gravitational field.   

As  we  discuss  before,  in  order  to  compare  the  theoretical  predictions  of  curved  space-time  with  the 

 

34

experiments carried out in the flat space-time of the earth, we have to transform the descriptions of curved 

space-time into that of flat space-time. Otherwise theoretical prediction is meaningless. Because the current 

calculation on the delay effect of radar wave is based on curved space-time, the result can not coincide with 

experiments carried out in the flat space-time of the earth. So it is improper to say that the delay effect of 

radar  wave  has  been  explained  well  in  the  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravitation,  though  it  is  effect  for  the 

perihelion precession of the Mercury and the deviation of light in the solar gravitational field. This result is 

easy  to  understand  because  the  first  two  experiments  are  only  relative  to  the  measurements  of  space 

distances, but the third experiment is relative to the measurement of time interval. In the discussion above, 

when  the  Schwarzschild  solution  is  transformed  into  the  fat  space-time  to  describe,  we  let  the  space 

coordinates to be equal to each other in the curved and flat reference frames. But the definitions of times 

are different in both reference frames.   

At  present  we  use  Eq.(4.62)  to  describe  photon’s  motion  in  the  gravitational  field  with  spherical 

symmetry  and  compare  the  theoretical  predictions  directly  with  the  experiments  and  astronomical 

observations carried out on the earth of which space-time is nearly flat. This result hints us actually that all 

quantities appearing in Eq.(4.62) have been considered as that defined in flat space-time. In the other words, 

the results tell us that we can use Eq.(4.62) directly to describe the deviation of light and the delay effect of 

radar  wave    in  gravitational  field  .  It  is  unnecessary  for  us  to  transform  the  formula  into  flat  reference 

frame again. Therefore, we can take Eq.(4.62) directly as a basic equation to describe photon’s motion in 

gravitational field and establish the theory of gravitation in flat reference frame.    Because we suppose that 

Eq. (4.62) is defined in flat space-time and the curvature of flat space-time is always zero, there is no any 

space-time  singularity  problem  again  for  the  theory.  So  we  can  say  that  it  is  just  by  reconstructing  the 

Einstein’s theory, we establish the theory of gravitation in flat space-time. 
   

5. Gravitational red shift and the essence of quasar’s red shift   

It  should  be  indicated  that  Eq.(4.62)  can  not  be  considered  as  the  dynamic  equation  of  photon  in 

gravitational field. According to the formula, we can write photon’s momentum and force as formally

When photon moves along the radius vector direction with

, we have 

. It seems that photon 

is not acted by force. But according to Eq.(4.69), photon has acceleration, so it should be acted by force in 

this case. Therefore, Eq.(4.62) is not the dynamic equation of photon. On the other hand, by considering 

(4.66), we can write Eq.(4.62) as

The  formula  can  only  be  regarded  as  the  motion  equation  of  classical  particle  without  considering  the

inertial mass and gravitational mass of photon which would change with speed. So it is only a formula to 

represent  photon’s  acceleration,  instead  of  dynamic  equation.  Though  for  classical  particles,  both  are  the 

same. But as shown below, we can obtain the proper dynamic equation of photon based on it.

Let’s  deduce  photon’s  motion  equation  under  the  condition

fictitious particle is acted by gravitation instead of repulse force. Suppose the fictitious particle’s  mass is 
0m ,  according  to  Eq.(4.18),  the  dynamic  equation  of 

#

0' =V

  is  equal  to  the  difference  between

On the other hand, we define the momentum of moving photon in gravitational field as

In  fact,  it  is  unnecessary  for  as  to  introduce  fictitious  particle.  We  can  suppose  directly  that  the  dynamic 

equation  of  photon  satisfy  the  formula  above,  as  long  as  the  calculation  results  coincide  with  practical

situations. Then let’s determine the forms of functions  ϕF

  and  R . From Eq.(4.70) we have

It shows that the force acted on photon is repulse one, instead of gravitation. This is easy to understand. If 

photon is acted by gravitation, its speed would increase generally when it  moves in gravitational field so 

that its speed would surpass light’s speed in vacuum. However, this is impossible in general.

Photon’s speed becomes zero when it reaches the potential. 

The  red  shift  problem  is  discussed  below.  According  to  general  relativity,  gravitational  field  would 

cause  time  delay  so  that  light’s  frequency  would  become  small  and  light’s  wave  length  would  become 

longer. However, in curved space-time, photon moves along the geodesic line without the action of force. 

So there is no concept of potential for photon in gravitational field. The total energy of photon is equal to

have 

known that the physical mechanics of the big red shifts of quasars is still an enigma at present. If the red 

shifts are considered to be the effect of cosmology caused by the recessive speed, quasars would be at very 

distant places. In this case, the brightness of quasars or the mechanics of energy source becomes a problem. 

If the red shifts of quasars are not caused by the Doppler’s effect, no physical theory can explain them at 

present.  Though  the  black  hole  theory  is  used  to  explain  quasar’s  red  shift,  same  problems  are  still

        As mentioned before that the Einstein’s theory of gravity can not be a universal one. The effectiveness 

of  the  Schwarzschild  solution  can  only  be  considered  as  a  haphazard  but  excellent  coincidence  in  weak 

field.  We  should  reestablish  gravitational  theory  in  flat  space-time  based  on  the  spherical  symmetry 

solution  the  Einstein’s  equation.  In  fact,  we  can  consider  Eqs.(4.25)  and  (4.72)  as  the  basic  dynamic 

equations of particles moving in the gravitational fields caused by other static particles. Then by means of 

the method of force’s superposition, we can construct gravitational interactions among the bodies with any 

different forms. No any other gravitational equations in curved space-time are needed again. In this way, 

we can establish the general theory of gravity in the form of electromagnetic interaction. The detail will be 

provided in the next section.

Section 5    Gravitational Theory Established in Flat Space-time 
and Dynamic Origin of the Universal Accelerating Expansion 

   
1. Gravitational theory established in flat space-time 

As we shown before that it is improper to consider the Einstein’s theory of gravity as the foundational 

interaction theory of gravity. The real value of the Einstein’s theory is to provide the Schwarzschild metric 

of static gravitational field  with spherical symmetry.  It  is useful to describe object’s motions in the weak 

field,  though  it  may  be  an  accidental  coincident.  The  later  theory  should  be  consistent  with  it.  After  the 

metric is transformed into flat space-time for discussion, the dynamic equation of gravitational interaction 

between two particles can be obtained. By considering the similarity between classical electromagnetic and 

gravitational theories as well as by  introducing some proper hypothesis, we can establish a more rational 

gravitational  theory  with  the  Lorentz  invariability.  The  descriptions  of  electromagnetic  and  gravitational 

interactions can also become consistent.   

In the first article, we prove that the absolutely resting reference frame should exist. In the absolutely 

resting reference frame, an object’s mass would be smallest. So we should establish gravitational theory in 

the  absolutely  resting  reference  frame  firstly.  After  that,  we  transform  the  theory  into  other  inertial 
0im   represent  the  static  mass  of  a  particle  in  the  absolutely  resting

The  result  is  interested  that  general  relativity  is  based  on  the  equivalent  principle  between  gravitational 

mass and inertial mass. But it only indicates that gravitational static mass is equivalent with inertial static 

mass actually. After the Schwarzschild solution of the Einstein’s theory of gravity is transformed into flat 

space-time for description, we reach the result that gravitational moving mass is not equivalent with inertial 

moving mass. 

The  classical  Newtonian  theory  of  gravitation  describes  the  gravitation  between  two  static  objects 

actually. The theory has two defects. One is that it can not satisfy the Lorentz invariability. Another is that it 

can not describe small effects of gravitation such as the perihelion precession of the Mercury and so on. So 

we  have  to  revise  it  from  these  two  sides.  By  considering  the  fact  that  the  validity  of  electromagnetic 

interaction theory and the comparability between the Newtonian formula of gravitation and the Coulomb 

 

41

formula  of  static  electrics,  if  there  exists  unity  between  gravitational  and  electromagnetic  interactions, 

gravitation would take the similar form of electromagnetic force, instead of that electromagnetic interaction 

should  be  coincide  with  gravitation  described  in  curved  space-time.  It  is  well  known  that  too  many 

singularities appear in the Einstein’s theory of gravitation described in curved space-time.   

Therefore, we introduce the concepts of electric-like and magnetic-like gravitations. Suppose that there 

are  two  particles  with  static  masses 

10m   and 

20m   moving  in  velocities 

  and 

  individually 

relative  to  the  absolutely  static  reference  frame.  The  electric-like  gravitation,  which  is  caused  by  the

If there are only two particles in the system, the angle momentum of unit mass 

is a constant. If there are more particles in the system, 

  is not a constant in general. Meanwhile, similar

Similar to electromagnetic theory, we can deduce

By means of Eq.(5.4), we get

It is useful to compare the intensities of magnetic-like and electromagnetic gravitations. We have

So  when

V << ,  the  magnetic-like  gravitation  can  be  neglected  comparing  with  the  electric-like 
gravitation.  This  is  just  the  reason  why  the  Newtonian  theory  of  gravitation  is  quite  effect  without

considering magnetic-like gravitations. In electromagnetic interaction, charged particle’s speeds are great in 

general  so  that  strong  magnetic  phenomena  would  be  caused.  But  in  the  strong  gravitational  field  with

        In  this  way,  we  can  establish  the  Maxwell’s  equations  of  gravitational  fields  in  the  similar  form  of

By  using  relation 

  in  Eq.(5.3),  we  can  transform  Eq.  (5.3)into  Eq.  (5.1)  and  get  the 

approximate formula of electric-like gravitation in the reference frame in which the sun is considered at rest. 

In this case, the sun’s magnetic-like gravitational can be regarded as zero approximately. Of cause, if two 

object’s  speeds  are  great,  the  addition  formula  of  velocity  in  special  relativity  and  the  magnetic-like 

gravitation should be taken into account. 

Meanwhile, this kind of gravitational theory has some natures below.   

        1.  In  this  theory,  quantization  of  gravitational  field  can  be  carried  out  in  the  similar  form  of 

electromagnetic field. Photon’s spin is 1 instead of 2.   

        2.  Similar  to  electromagnetic  theory,  this  gravitational  theory  may  be  renormalizable.  So  it  may 

provide a simplest foundation for the unified theory of four forces.   

        3. The energy  momentum tensors of gravitational fields can be also defined well as that done in the 

electromagnetic fields. The difficulty existing in general relativity can be avoided.   

4. There exist dipole radiations of gravitational waves in this theory as that in electromagnetic theory. 

According to general relativity, the lowest order of gravitational radiation is the fourth order. There exist no 

dipole  radiations.  This  point  is  one  of  biggest  differences  between  two  theories,  which  can  be  used  to 

decide which one is alight. At present, we only use quadrupole resonance apparatus to detect gravitational 

waves but find nothing. It may be more effective to use dipole resonance apparatus to do it.   

        It  is  useful  to  estimate  the  radiation  strength  of  gravitational  wave  in  the  theory.  Similar  to 
V << , the power of its 
electromagnetic theory, when a particle with static  mass  m   moves  in a speed 
gravitational radiation is   

c

                                                                           

                                                              (5.26)

It  was  pointed  by  E. A. Milne  in  1943  that  the  Newtonian  theory  of  gravity  could  also  be  used  to

theory is the same as that in general relativity. By the additional consideration of gravitational moving mass 

describe  the  problem  of  universal  expansion

shown in this paper, the accelerating expansion of the universe can be explained naturally.   

We  take  the  reference  frame  which  is  at  rest  with  the  original  point  of  Big-band  as  the  absolutely 

resting reference frame. Based on it, we discuss the Big-bang cosmology problem. Firstly, we deduce the

forward  based  on  the  universal  item  of  the  Einstein’s  equation  of  gravitational  field.  It  was  thought  that 

more than 70% of material in the universe was dark energy. The dark energy has the action of repulsion. It 

leaded  to  the  universal  accelerating  expansion.  However,  this  kind  of  dark  energy  goes  beyond  the 

knowledge of mankind about material and energy at present. According to the paper, the problem becomes 

simple and normal. As long as the Schwarzschild solution of the Einstein’s equation of gravitational field is 

transformed into flat space-time to describe, we can propose gravitational moving mass which is not equal 

to  inertial  moving  mass.  By  means  of  the  concept  of  gravitational  moving  mass,  we  can  deduce  the 

accelerating expansion of the universe consequentially. The concept of dark energy is unnecessary.   

Let’s discuss how to write Eq.(5.30) in the motion equation form of cosmology. Suppose the universe

So we can discuss the problems of cosmology  without the Einstein’s theory of gravity. This kind of 

method  is  based  on  flat  space-time.  There  is  no  the  problem  of  space  curvature.  Because  there  is  no  the 

concept  of  critical  density  of  material  in  the  theory,  we  have  no  consistent  problem  between  observed 

material densities and critical material density. Therefore, we also do not need the concept of dark material. 

Since  the  concept  of  non-baryon  dark  material  was  put  forward  in  1970’s  last  century,  thirty  years  has 

elapsed. But there is no any non-baryon dark material is founded, though great efforts have been paid. This 

situation is very abnormal comparing with particle physics. During the same period, so many new particles 

have been founded. 

On  the  other  hand  according  to  Eq.(5.20),  the  electric-like  and  magnetic-like  gravitations  are  not 

isotropy in space, it may be considered as an original disturbance to explain the conglobation configuration 

of material and the anisotropy of micro-background radiation in the current universe. It is obvious that we 

should re-discuss the fundamental problems of cosmology based on the flat space-time.   
   
3. The possibility to explain the Pioneer Anomaly   

NASA  has lunched a series of spacecrafts such as the Pioneers 10 and 11 for the exploration of `the 
Jupiter and Saturn since 1970’s last century. Recently, it is founded that most of the spacecrafts departure 

acceleration is found for them with 

their  orbits.  The  orbits  are  calculated  by  the  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravitation.  An  additional  constant

spacecrafts, were excluded, scientists in NASA affirmed that there exists the unexplained Pioneer Anomaly.

Since the Pioneer Anomaly  was founded in 1998, many theories had been proposed, but none of them 
pa are  calculated  actually  by  the  PPN 
approximate  method  based  on  the  Einstein’s  theory.  So  the  Pioneer  Anomaly  means  that  the  Einstein’s 

was  satisfied.  The  orbits  of  the  spacecrafts  and  the  acceleration 

theory of gravitation would be revised.    New we discuss the possibility to explain the Pioneer Anomaly in 

light of this paper’s theory. The accelerations of spacecrafts are calculated by using the formula below

Because the PPN approximate method is also based on curved space-time actually, the acceleration shown 

in Eq.(5.39) can not be compared with the experiments carried on the earth before it is transformed into the 

result in flat space-time. According to Eq.(5.2), the acceleration of spacecraft should be

. So the earth, Jupiter and other planets would also cause additional accelerations 

for spacecraft. Especially, the Jupiter and Saturn’s masses are quite big, the additional accelerations should 

be taken into account.   

In the practical calculations, the magnetic-like gravitation caused by the motions of planets should also 

be  considered.  The  time  delay  effects  of  radar  waves  emitted  by  spacecraft  should  also  be  calculated  by 

means of Eq.(4.74). At last, the really strict calculations should be carried out in the absolutely reference 

frame.  Because  the  multi-body  problems  are  involved,  the  practical  orbits  of  spacecrafts  should  be 

calculated by computer. By comparing the results of numerical value calculations with the practical orbits 

of  spacecraft,  we  can  judge  whether  or  not  the  theory  of  this  papers  is  more  rational  than  the  general 

relativity.  If  it  is  alight,  we  would  reach  a  really  rational  theory  of  gravitation,  and  obtain  a  credible 

foundation for the unification of four interaction forces.   

A  hundred  years  ago,  in  order  to  explain  the  light’s  propagations  in  vacuum,  the  hypothesis  of  the 

ether  with  very  strange  natures  was  putted  forward.  In  order  to  eliminate  the  ether,  Einstein  established 

special  relativity.  After  that,  he  put  forward  general  relativity.  The  theories  caused  the  idea  revolution  of 

space-time  and  gravitation  and  promoted  the  development  of  physics.  A  hundred  year  later,  in  order  to 

explain  so  many  contradictions  and  anomalies,  we  foist  too  many  things  such  as  dark  energy  and  dark 

material  into  vacuum  again.  The  situation  actually  indicates  that  we  need  another  idea  renewal  on 

space-time and gravitation. The result would be that the concepts of dark material and dark energy is given

up, just the concept of the ether was given up a hundred years ago.

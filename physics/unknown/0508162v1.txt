Summary.    We  introduce  an  autoregressive-type  model  with  self-modulation 
effects for a foreign exchange rate by separating the foreign exchange rate into a 
moving average rate and an uncorrelated noise. From this model we indicate that 
traders are mainly using strategies with weighted feedbacks of the past rates in the 
exchange  market.  These  feedbacks  are  responsible  for  a  power  law  distribution 
and characteristic autocorrelations of rate changes.

Introduction 

1. 
 
The  probability  densities  of  rate  changes  of  foreign  exchange  markets  generally 
have  fat  tails  compared  with  the  normal  distribution  and  the  volatility  always 
shows  a  long  autocorrelation  [1].  In  order  to  clarify  the  mechanism  of  these 
nontrivial  behaviors,  we  introduce  an  auto-regressive  type  model  with  self-
modulation effects for the exchange rate by using the new technique of separating 
moving average rates and residual uncorrelated noises [2,3]. We are going to show 
that  these  nontrivial  behaviors  are  caused  by  traders’  strategies  with  weighted 
feedbacks of the past rates. In this paper we use a set of tick-by-tick data provided 
by CQG for the yen-dollar exchange rates from 1989 to 2002.

2.  The best moving average 

Traders  are  generally  predicting  future  exchange  rates  using  various  types  of 
moving  averages.  We  first  introduce  so-called  the  best  moving  average  rate  that 
separates uncorrelated noises from the market data.

tuning  the  weight  factors  we  tried  to  find  the  best  set  of  weights  that  makes  the

From  these  results,  we  find  that  the  characteristic  time  of  the  best  moving 
average  is  generally  about  a  minute,  namely,  most  traders  are  expected  to  be 
watching only very latest market data of order of a few minutes. 
 

3.  Self modulation process for foreign exchange rate 

As a mathematical  model of foreign exchange market that is directly compatible 
with  the  tick-by-tick  data,  we  now  introduce  an  auto-regressive  type  model with 
self-modulation effects as follows,

We  compare  the  simulated  rates  to  the  real  yen-dollar  rates.  In  Fig.3  the 
 by  our  simulation  is 
cumulative  distribution  of  rate  changes 
plotted together with the real data. The two graphs fit quite nicely both showing 
power law behaviors as indicated in the figure.

This power law property can be understood theoretically from the view point of 
self-modulation  process  that  is  a  stochastic  process  of  which  basic  parameters 
such  as  the  mean  value  are  modulated  by  the  moving  average  of  its  own  traces 
[4,5,6].  According  to  the  results  of  self-modulation  processes  it  is  a  natural 
consequence that the resulting market rates show power law properties when the 
multiplicative factor 
 in Eq.(6) fluctuates randomly. 

( )b t

The autocorrelation of rate changes and that of the volatility are plotted in Fig.4 
and Fig.5, respectively. In both cases the simulation results fit with the real data 
quite  nicely.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  functional  form  of  the  autocorrelation 
functions  depend  on  the  weight  factors 
,  and  the  interesting 
point is that the weight factors work quite well, namely, the principle of making 
the residue terms independent is effective.

We  introduced  a  new  type of  foreign  exchange  rate  equation  that  describes  very 
short time characteristics of markets consistent with the real data. It is well-known 
that traders are generally using moving average methods for predicting the future 
rates. Our model represents this general property of traders by introducing the best 
( )b t

weight factors of the moving averages 
 
that  expresses  responses  of  dealers  to  the  past  market  rate  changes.  From  our 
model  it  is  confirmed  that  this  feedback  of  information  is  responsible  for  the 
power  law  distribution  of rate  changes  and  characteristic  autocorrelations  of rate 
changes and volatility.

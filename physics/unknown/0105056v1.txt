the  sound  velocity  Hierarchy  of 

We  discuss  the  structure,  physical  nature,  dynamic  genesis  of  clearly  detected  diffuse 
backgrounds  (radiations)  in  the  Universe.  From  the  point  of  view  of  Wave  Universe  concept  it  is 
shown,  that  observed  Backgrounds  Hierarchy  (Polyphony  of  Universe)  is  close  connected    and  
causely  determined  by 
the  physical  medium,  cosmic 
(polycomponent) plasma. The well-known Microwave Background (Cosmic Background Radiation 
 Background, that is characterized by the calculated sound velocity 
- CBR) corresponds to the F

In  the  frame  of  Wave  Universe  concept,  megawave  and  Shell  structure  of  astronomical 
systems,  considering  as  wave  dynamic  systems  (WDS)  [Chechelnitsky,  1980-2001],  in  the 
polycomponent  cosmic  plasma  there  is  the  hierarchy  of  velocities  of  disturbances  propagations

In  the  wave  structure  of  the  Solar  System  for  planetary  orbits  of  Mercury  (ME),  Venus  (V),

It  should  be  interesting  to  verify  if  correspond  to  its  in  observations  and  experiments  another

The  positive  result  of  purposeful  observations  and  experiments  can  make,  in  particular,  more 
clear,  observable  fundamental  physical  property  of  both  microwave  background  and  another  (in 
particular,  X-Rays,  Gamma-Rays,  etc.)  backgrounds  (phones)  -  its  (local) isotropy, gomogeneity, 
informly  filling  of  the  sky  sphere,  its  diffuse  character.  This  is  consequence  of  the  fundamental 
  Shell  (propagation  in  it  is  isotropy, 
dynamical  property  -  isotropy  of  cosmic  medium  in  each  G
sound velocities are equal for any directions of propagation).

MANY YEARS LATER 
 

More then decade go away from the original date of promulgation and discussion of Universe 
Poliphony  concept  [Chechelnitsky,  1986  a,b,c].  Additonal  received  at  that  time  observational 
information,  correspondence  observations  to  the  theory  prediction  only  intensify  the  positions  of 
above  discussed  representation.  As  before  in  the  center  of  view  of  astrophysics  and  cosmology 
stay  the  problem  of  physical  nature,  fundamental  genesis  of  microwave  background  (CBR)  and 
another  observed  diffuse  background  radiations  of  Universe.  And  as  before  many  aspects  of 
standard theory representations remain extremely vulnerable for the criticism. We point only some 
of  them. 
 
DYNAMICAL STATUS OF MICROWAVE BACKGROUND 
 

From  the  view  of  Wave  Universe  concept  hardly  it  has  not  a  sense  to  attribute  to  only 
microwave  background  (Cosmic  Background  Radiation  -  CBR)  any  special  (distinguished  from 
another backgrounds) status. 

Frequentely attached to it the term - Relict - attempts to underline its special status. Evidently, 
this  term  has  conceptual  load,  connected  with  special  representation  about  its  genesis  in  the 
frame of  Hot Universe  and Big Bang concept. 

But  why  the  cosmology  may  consider  only  the  one  -  microwave  -  background  as  remainder-

relict of Big Bang, but whole set of backgrounds (close near it displaced) - is not? 

In the frame of carring analysis and common sense it is represented as the more argumented 

principle - either all backgrounds are relict (?), or - not a single (!). 

Wave Universe concept insists on actual (today's) (but not on inherited from event outstanding 

by billion years ago) nature of the microwave background, more exactly,  
of  microwave  backgrounds.  Becouse  any  wave  dynamic  system  (WDS)  of  Universe,  such  local 
astronomical system as the Solar system, our Galaxy, Local Superclaster (Virgo) is characterized 
by own G

 Shells and corresponding F

 backgrounds. 

[3]

[3]

And  then,  observing  the  Heaven  from  the  Earth,  we  must  detect  not  entirely  homogeneous, 
isotropic  background  (and  not  a  single),  but  some  superposition,  covering  of  microwave 
backgrounds  of  these  (Local)  astonomical  systems  of  more  and  more  growing  scales  (inside  of 
those is enclosed an Observer). 

And  then  it  becomes  comprehend  in  more  degree  the  phenomenon  of  observing  with  high 
resolution  in  the  last  time  pecularities  of  the  cosmic  background  radiation  (CBR)  (microwave 
background). 

It may be wait, for instance, that with multiple precision of observational astronomy the region of 
own microwave background of Our Galaxy (in the form of distinguished pecularity) will be remind  
(in the Galaxy system of coordinates) some lense (similar to radiogalo), which contains the more 
compact part of Galaxy. 

And indeed, at [Bennet et al., 1996; Lasenby and Hancock, 1997, p. 220, Fig.3] it can see this

forseeing  in  the  frame  of  Wave  Universe  concept  the  local  microwave  background  lense  of  our 
Galaxy  -  as  nonhomogeneity  in  measurment  of  the  temperature  of  cosmic  background  radiation 
(CBR) on COBE satellite. 

Observed  in  infrared  rays  giant  shell  (corona)  of  NGC  4565  galaxy  [Spinrad  et  al.,  1978; 
Marochnik and Suchkov, 1984, Fig. 61, Fig.1] is the bright illustration of existence of another local 
backgrounds  and  connected  with  its  local  Shells  in  far  astronomical  objects.  Evidently,  this  giant

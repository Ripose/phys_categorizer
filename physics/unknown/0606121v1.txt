Thermophoresis moves molecules along temperature gradients, typically from hot to cold. We superpose fluid

flow  with  thermophoretic  molecule  flow  under  well  defined  microfluidic  conditions,  imaged  by  fluorescence

microscopy. DNA is trapped and accumulated 16-fold in regions where both flows move in opposite directions.

Strong  800-fold  accumulation  is  expected,  however  with  slow  trapping  kinetics.  The  experiment  is  equally

described  by  a  three-dimensional  and  one-dimensional  analytical  model.  As  an  application,  we  show  how  a

radially converging temperature field confines short DNA into a 10 µm small spot.

Introduction. Contact free methods to manipulate single particles are rare. Common tools are electrophoresis

and optical-tweezers. However, in optical trapping, forces scale with particle volume, limiting the method to parti-
cles larger than about 500 nm. Less well known as a tool for optical molecule manipulation is thermophoresis1,2,

where molecules are moved by a thermal gradient. With laser heating, it allows all-optical microscale access to

small molecules, in contrast to electrophoresis. The achieved active accumulation of biomolecules helps to over-

come diffusion limitations in both surface and bulk biochemical reactions. A well known example is the diffusion

limited reaction kinetics on DNA microarrays.

Recent  advances  in  measuring  thermophoresis  using  holographic  scattering3-6,  optical  lensing7-9,  beam
deflection10-12  and  optothermal  microfluidics13,14  lead  to  a  better  understanding  of  thermophoresis15-19.  Most

experiments  to  measure  thermophoresis3,9,10-14  use  conditions  where  fluid  flow  can  be  neglected.  However,  in
elongated columns thermophoretic accumulation can be amplified by thermal convection20-23, and flat geometries
with toroidal convection flow yield point accumulations13,28. In thermal field flow fractionation (ThFFF), the fluid

flows  perpendicular  to  the  temperature  gradient  and  separates  molecules  by  their  respective  thermophoretic
response24-26. For the first time, we orient the fluid flow along the thermal gradient, made possible with optical

heating by an infrared laser focus. The combination of thermophoresis and fluid flow results in strong trapping of

small biomolecules (Fig. 1). As we will show, the experiments are equally described by three-dimensional (3D) or

one-dimensional (1D) models. 

Flow trap. Molecules drift away from the heat by thermophoresis, counteracted by a passive liquid flow. As a

result, molecules are trapped upstream of the warm spot. Generally accepted is a phenomenological foundation of

the thermophoretic drift based on the Onsager theory of linear non equilibrium thermodynamics. For low molecule

concentrations the thermophoretic drift velocity v is proportional to temperature gradient

 with molecule concentration c and diffusion coefficient D. In steady state, with fluid at rest, diffusional and

thermophoretic  flow  balance.  Fluid  flow  directly  opposes  a  thermal  gradient  in  a  microfluidic  channel  with

10µm x 10µm cross section (Fig. 2a). The channel is surrounded by PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) silicone using
a  manufacture  protocol  described  previously14.  We  oppose  the  flow  of  DNA  containing  water  with  a  locally

enhanced temperature gradient, created with a focussed infrared laser (Furukawa FOL1405-RTV-317, 1480 nm).

Fluid flow is controlled gravitationally by two open 5 µl syringes of defined height, connected to the microfluidics

with silicone tubings (Carl Roth Laborbedarf). 

The channel is imaged with a 40x oil objective on an AxioTech Vario fluorescence microscope (Zeiss), illumi-

nated  with  a  high  power  LED  (Luxeon)  and  recorded  with  the  CCD  Camera  SensiCam  QE  (PCO).  Details  of
bleaching correction and temperature extraction were described previously14. Temperature increase is measured by

the temperature dependent fluorescence signal of the dye BCECF, diluted to 50 µM in 10 mM TRIS buffer. From

the  total  BCECF  temperature  dependence  of  -2.4 %/K,  only  -0.9 % /K  stems  from  pH  drift  of  the  used  TRIS
buffer. The remaining -1.5 % /K are the result of thermophoresis of the dye itself14. Temperature was increased by

DNA is flowing from the left with an effective velocity of 0.55 µm/s against the warm spot. Within 15 minutes,

DNA accumulates 16-fold in the front, i.e. left of the warm spot. Images of DNA concentration recorded by fluo-

rescence at different times are shown in Fig. 2d. First, DNA is depleted at the warm spot (right side), followed by

accumulation in front of the depletion (left side) as the water drift from the left brings in DNA. The depletion on

the  right  is  slowly  fading  in  the  progress  of  accumulation,  filled  by  diffusion  from  the  accumulated  DNA.  The

We  used  the  experimentally  obtained  Lorentzian  temperature  profile  with  a  constant  temperature  in  y-  and
z-direction due to low thermal conductivity of PDMS (Fig. 2b,c). Diffusion coefficient D = 1.7 µm2/s and thermo-
phoretic  mobility  DT = 1.1 µm2/(sK)  were  taken  from  measurements  on  10.000  base  pair  DNA  in  1 mM  TRIS
buffer15. Convection has proven insignificant in these thin fluid films14 with convection velocities on the order of

nm/s. We plot the simulated cross section DNA concentrations over time next to the corresponding experimental

results  (Fig. 2d,e).  As  expected,  due  to  the  fast  diffusion  relaxation  time  across  the  channel  on  the  order  of

 is smeared out in the accumulation

and does not lead to a spacial inhomogeneity. 

One-dimensional model. The model can be reduced to one dimension due to fast diffusion across the channel.

We will show that it describes the experiments equally well. We assume a plug flow instead of an parabolic flow

. Fig. 3 shows the DNA concentrations at the center of the channel at various times. The

overlaid  solid  lines  from  the  one  dimensional  simulation  fit  the  data  very  well.  We  see  that  thermophoresis

opposed by a fluid flow can be described by a straightforward superpositions of flows by Eq.(3). It leads to a fast

and strong accumulation of DNA molecules. Accumulations at longer times in steady state can be described by an

analytical model. Without fluid flow, thermophoresis and diffusion balance in steady state. For constant D and DT
at low DNA concentration c compared to water molecules Eq.(2) can be integrated to

mulation: as the drift velocity increases, the initially depleting potential U for v = 0 builds up a potential trough

upstream (left) of the warm spot (Fig. 4a). The trough dimensions become smaller as the drift velocity v increases

and is large in width and depth for small flow velocities. Based on the potential image, we understand the strong

attraction of molecules in steady state calculated for low values of v (Fig. 4b). The accumulation diminishes as

drift v increases and the tilting of the potential by the term 

vx–

D⁄

 leads to a shallower and less wide potential

trough. For the steady state solution in a one-dimensional model, accumulation is peaking for slower drift veloci-

ties.  At  v=0.04 µm/s,  accumulation  is  maximal  with  820-fold  DNA  concentration  in  front  of  the  heat  spot

(Fig. 4b).  While  smaller  drift  v  makes  the  potential  deeper  and  accumulation  stronger  (Fig. 4a,b),  considerably

more time is needed to transport the DNA to the trap and reach a steady state. For example, the time to reach above

820x accumulation steady state is 1000 h or 41 days. The peak concentration is located with good approximation at

the minimum of the effective potential U(x), i.e. the maximal concentration is located at the point where thermo-

phoretic drift

Flow and gradient dependence. The point of maximum accumulation is located closer to the heated center for

higher velocities v (Fig. 4a,b), since the temperature gradient is stronger there. Fig. 5a shows the velocity depen-

dence of DNA accumulation within a short time of 15 min. To reach maximal accumulation of 10 kbp DNA within

this time, v=0.55 µm/s is optimal. Both faster and slower drift decreases the accumulation in the chosen finite time.

The  velocity  for  maximal  accumulation  efficiency  barely  depends  on  DNA  length,  allowing  to  infer  DNA  size

from the achieved accumulation at a constant drift v. As Fig. 5b shows, size selectivity and the magnitude of accu-

6

mulation within the limited time span of 15 min, is exceptionally sensitive to focus width. Decreasing the focal

width from 12 µm to 2 µm increases the accumulation of 10 kbp DNA within 15 min by an order of magnitude. 

Radial flow trap in a sheet of liquid. As temperature is created by optical means, we are not limited to a fixed

focus  in  a  microfluidic  flow  channel.  For  example,  DNA  in  a  two-dimensional  20 µm  high  water  sheet  can  be

accumulated by optically imposed circular heat rings which move concentrically towards a spot (Fig. 6). With a

radial drift of v = 2.3 µm/s and a average temperature of ∆TMax = 20 K, short 1000 base pair DNA was accumu-
lated 6-fold in a spot of 10 µm radius within 80 seconds. This result illustrates how optically triggered thermo-

phoretic traps can accumulate molecules in a variety of geometries.

Conclusion. Opposing thermophoretic flow against a fluid flow creates a molecule trap. Fluorescence measure-

ments in a microfluidic channel agrees well with the one dimensional superposition of both flows. Within 15 min-

utes, 10.000 base pair DNA was accumulated 16-fold by a 16 K warm microscopic spot. We showed that 1000

base pair DNA can be 6-fold accumulated to a spot by radially moving a circular temperature ring.

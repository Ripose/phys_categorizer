Abstract: 
Mg-Cu-Zn ferrite was prepared through a wet synthetic method by a self-combustion reaction 
directly from a citrate precursor. The as-synthesized powders were sintered at  750 C(cid:1)
for only 
2h. XRD patterns and FTIR  spectra confirm the formation of single phase Mg-Cu-Zn ferrite 
after combustion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Mg-Cu-Zn ferrite is 
sintered at such low temperature. The sintering process increased the crystallinity of the solid 
and the domain sizes.

Keywords: Citrate method, Mg-Cu-Zn ferrite, low temperature sintering 

1.  Introduction: 
With  the  rapid  development  of  mobile  communication  and  information 
technology,  the  electronic  devices  with  small  size,  low  cost  and  high 
performance  are  quite  demanded  [1].  Recently,  surface  mounting  devices 
(SMD) have been rapidly developed using multilayer chip inductors (MLCI). 
These  chip  inductors  are  produced  by  coating  ferrite  and  electrical  paste 
alternately  and  then  co-firing.  Since  Ag  is  usually  used  as  an  electrode 
material,  high  temperature  co-firing  causes  an  unexpected  lowering  of  the 
inductance  due  to  the  interfacial  reaction  (via  diffusion)  between  the  ferrite 
and  the  Ag  electrode.  This  interfacial  reaction  can  be  suppressed  [2]  by  co-
firing  at  a  temperature  lower  than  the  melting  point  of  Ag  (approximately 
).  Therefore,  low-temperature  sintering  is  of  great  importance  to 
960 C(cid:1)
suppress  the  interfacial  diffusion.  Ni-Cu-Zn  ferrite  is  usually  used  as  a 
magnetic  material  for  multilayer  chip  inductors  due  to  its  lower  sintering 
temperature and  better properties at high frequency than Ni-Zn ferrite. But it 
was  found  that  these  ferrites  are  comparatively  sensitive  to  stress  and 
magnetic properties easily changed or deteriorated by the stress caused at the 
internal electrode [2]. 
In  order  to  overcome  these  problems,  Mg-Cu-Zn  ferrites  were  found  to  be 
suitable  [3].  Normally,  Mg-Cu-Zn  ferrites  were  sintered  at  temperatures 
In  order  to  use  these  ferrites  in  multilayer  chip 
higher  than  1000 C(cid:1)
components,  the sintering temperature must not be over the  melting  point  of 
Ag. 
The  aim  of  this  work  is  to  present  a  novel  and  economical  method  of 
preparation  of  Mg-Cu-Zn  ferrite  by  the  citrate  precursor  method  in  order  to 
achieve sintering at lower temperatures. 
The citrate precursor method is a promising method in the synthesis of some 
technical  ceramics  [4,5].  Since  all  the  reactants  are  solutions,  they  can  be 
mixed at a level of molecule or atom, and the amount of the reactants can be 
controlled accurately. This wet chemical method has unique advantages over

conventional  sintering  processes  in  terms  of  obtaining  nanoparticles  that can 
be densified easily at lower temperature.  
 
2.  Experimental procedure:
2.1. Sample preparation:
Fe O was chosen to conduct this study. All used reagents were 
Mg Cu Zn
of  AR  grade.  Aqueous  solution  of  stoichiometric  amounts  of  magnesium, 
copper, zinc and iron nitrates were reacted with citric acid in 1:1 molar ratio. 
pH of the solution was increased to 7 by addition of ammonium hydroxide to 
complete the reaction of the Mg-Cu-Zn citrate precursor. 
The solution was evaporated very slowly over a period of ten to twelve hours 
to  dryness.  Viscosity  and  color  changed  as  the  sol  turned  into  puffy,  porous 
dry  gel.  As  soon  as  the  solvent  removal  is  completed,  dried  precursor 
undergoes  a  self-ignition  reaction  to  form  a  very  fine  powder  known  as  as-
synthesized powder. 
The as-synthesized powder thus obtained was treated in a furnace at  250 C(cid:1)
for 
6 h followed  by  a  further  heat  treatment  at  380 C(cid:1)
for  6  h  to  remove  the 
residual carbon. Then the powder was divided into two patches, the first patch 
was  pressed  into  pellets  of  10  mm  diameter  and  a  thickness  of  4  mm  for 
dilatometer studies, and the second patch was pressed into pellets (of 25 mm 
at 200 MPa) and  toroids (with internal and external diameters 10 and 25 mm, 
respectively, and a thickness of 4 mm) and sintered at  750 C(cid:1)
for two hours in 
air. 
 
2.2. Characterization:
The  thermal  decomposition  of  the  as-synthesized  powder  was  investigated  by 
means of a differential thermal analyser (DTA, Linseis L62 thermal analyzer) at 
a heating rate of 
In  order  to  determine  the  suitable  sintering  temperature,  dilatometer  studies

were  performed  using  (Setaram,  TMA  92)  at  a  heating  rate  of 
nitrogen. 
A computer interface X-ray powder diffractometer (Philips) with Cu K (cid:1) radiation

to 

The  data  collection  was  over  the  2-theta  range  of 
in  steps  of 
0.04 / sec . Crystallite size was calculated from the width of the (311) line using 
the Scherrer formula corrected for instrumental broadening. 
The IR  spectra in the 400-2000 cm-1 range were recorded at room temperature 
on  the  infrared  spectrophotometer    (Bruker,  Vector22).  For  recording  IR 
spectra, powders were mixed with KBr in the ratio 1:250 by weight  to ensure 
uniform dispersion in the KBr pellet. The mixed powders were then pressed in a 
cylindrical die to obtain clean discs of approximately 1 mm thickness. 
A definite  number  of  turns  were  wound  around  each  toroid  to  measure  the 
inductance of the coil, L, in the range 10-2000 kHz. 
The initial permeability µi was estimated from the relation:

3.  Results and discussions: 
3.1. Thermal behavior:
Figure  (1)  shows  the  DTA  curve  of  the  as-synthesized  powder.  There  is  a 
large  exothermic  peak  in  the  range  320-380 C(cid:1) which  is  assigned  to  the 
decomposition of the citrate complex.  
Whereas the gentle, faint endothermic peak at  590 C(cid:1) corresponds to solid state 
reaction of the resulting oxides.

However,  we  noticed  that  the  sintering  temperature  augmented  to  about 
1200 C(cid:1) when we replaced the heat treatment of the as-synthesized powder by 
a microwave treatment till the disappearance of glow, in order to realize both 
the  decomposition  of  the  citrate  and  the  removal  of  the  residual  carbon.  We 
attribute  this  augmentation  in  the  sintering  temperature  to  the  large  size  of 
grains due to microwave treatment [6]. 
 
3.2. X-ray patterns: 
The  X-ray  diffraction  patterns  of  the  as-synthesized  powder,  the  heat-treated 
powder and the sintered ceramics at  750 C(cid:1)
for 2h. are shown in Figure (3). It 
is evident that the sintered sample contains only the spinel cubic ferrite. Mg-
Cu-Zn  ferrite  is  formed  and  all  the  peaks  in  the  pattern  match  well  with 
JCPDS card.

There  are  no  additional  peaks  corresponding  to  extra  phases  such  as 
H-Fe O which  often  appear  at  low  temperatures  when  the  reaction  is  not 
complete.  It  may  be  mentioned  that,  synthesis  of  single  phase  Mg-Cu-Zn 
ferrite  by  conventional  ceramic  methods  necessitate  repeated  grinding  and 
calcinations at temperatures above 1000 C(cid:1)
The  sintering  process  increased  the  crystallinity  of  the  solid  and  the  domain 
sizes. Crystallite size was estimated at 24 nm. 
 
3.2. IR Spectra:
In  order  to  confirm  the  formation  of  the  spinel  phase  and  to  understand  the 
nature  of  the  residual  carbon  in  the  samples,  the  FTIR  spectra  of  the  as-
synthesized powders and thermally treated powder were recorded, Figure (4). 
The  as-synthesized  sample  shows  characteristic  absorptions  of  ferrite  phase 
with  a  strong  absorption  around  600  cm-1  and  weak  absorption  in  the  range 
410-450 cm-1[8]. This difference in the band position is expected because of 
the  difference  in  the  Mn+-O2-  distance  for  the  octahedral  and  tetrahedral 
compounds.  Waldron  [9]  studied  the  vibrational  spectra  of  ferrites  and 

attributed the sharp absorption band around 600 cm-1 to the intrinsic vibrations 
of the tetrahedral  groups and the other band the octahedral groups.

There  are  two  weak  and  broad  absorptions  around  1400  and  1600  cm-1 
corresponding  to  the  presence  of  small  amount  of  residual  carbon  in  the 
samples. These absorptions in the present case are very weak which indicates 
that  the  residual  carbon  has  mostly  burnt  away  during  the  self-combustion 
process. The wave numbers of these absorptions indicate that this carbon is in 
for 6 h followed by a 
the form of complex carbonates. Heat treatment at  250 C(cid:1)
further  heat  treatment  at  380 C(cid:1)
for  6  h  led  to  the  disappearance  of  these 
absorptions  indicating  complete  removal  of  residual  carbon  from  the  sample 
[10].  
 
3.4. Initial permeability:
It’s known that the permeability of polycrystalline ferrite can be described as 
the superposition of domain wall and pin rotation components.  At small grain 
sizes,  the  grain  become  monodomain  and  the  reversal  of  magnetization  can 
only occur through spin rotation.

4.  Conclusion: 
The  powder  synthesized  by  the  citrate  precursor  method  demonstrated 
considerable  sinterability.  It’s  regarded  that  the  fine  particle  morphology  of 
the  powder  synthesized  by this method is responsible  for  its higher  sintering 
activity.  The  very  fact  that  single  phase  ferrite  could  be  obtained  directly  by 
citrate  precursor  without  any  additional  heat-treatments  above  750 C(cid:1)
is  a 
significant achievement considering the variety of applications of the Mg-Cu-
Zn  ferrite.  The  highly  active  powders  could  be  sintered  at  relatively  low 
temperatures to obtain highly dense and homogeneous polycrystalline ferrites 
for high frequency applications.

Abstract. We examine the relationship between the Bayesian and information-theoretic formula-
tions of source separation algorithms. This work makes use of the relationship between the work of
Claude E. Shannon and the “Recent Contributions" by Warren Weaver (Shannon & Weaver 1949)
as clariﬁed by Richard T. Cox (1979) and expounded upon by Robert L. Fry (1996) as a duality
between a logic of assertions and a logic of questions. Working with the logic of assertions requires
the use of probability as a measure of degree of implication. This leads to a Bayesian formulation
of the problem. Whereas, working with the logic of questions requires the use of entropy as a mea-
sure of the bearing of a question on an issue leading to an information-theoretic formulation of the
problem.

INTRODUCTION

The problem of source separation concerns the identiﬁcation of source signals given
only detected mixtures of those signals along with some prior knowledge of the physical
situation under consideration, such as the origin, propagation, and detection of source
activity. This problem is very closely related to the problems of source localization
(Knuth & Vaughan 1998; Fry & Bierbaum 2000), blind deconvolution (Bretthorst 1992,
Bell & Sejnowski 1995), and even waveform interpolation (Bretthorst 1992).

Aside from various cumulant-based algebraic methods (Tucker 1964; Cardoso &
Souloumiac 1993; Cardoso 1995; Cardoso & Comon 1996; De Lathauwer et al. 1995),
the majority of algorithms relied on the design of a neural network-based architectures,
which utilized minimum mutual information (Infomax) (Nadal & Parga 1994; Bell &
Sejnowski 1995; Cardoso 1997; Lee & Orglmeister 1997) or relative entropy (Amari
1996; Pearlmutter & Parra 1996; Yang & Amari 1997) to obtain optimal solutions. While
these information-theoretic techniques have dominated the scene, early demonstrations
that equivalent or similar results could be obtained by using maximum likelihood (Gaeta
& Lacoume 1990; Pham et al. 1992; MacKay 1996; Cardoso 1997) have lead to the ap-
plication of probability theory via Bayesian inference to the problem (Knuth 1998a,b,
1999; Roberts 1998; Rowe 1999; Everson and Roberts 1999; Mohammad-Djafari 1999).
The fact that information theory, historically based on the efﬁciency of signal transmis-
sion, and probability theory, based on inferential relationships among assertions, can
lead to identical algorithms suggests a deeper relationship between the two ﬁelds. In-
deed, this relationship between transmission of messages and the semantic meaning of
messages was recognized quite early on by Weaver (Shannon & Weaver 1949) and is

the main thrust of Weaver’s “Recent Additions", although it took Richard Cox to put
this relationship into a precise mathematical form.

THE LOGICAL STRUCTURE OF INFERENCE AND INQUIRY

Richard T. Cox is perhaps best known for having proved that probability is the unique
logically-consistent measure of a relative degree of implication among assertions (Cox
1946, 1961). Using Boolean logic, an assertion a implies an assertion b, written a
b, if
a
b is an assertion
that tells what a and b tell jointly, and
b is an
assertion that tells what a and b tell in common. As an example consider two assertions

is the logical or operation such that a

“It is French bread!" and b

“It is food!". 1

ability as the degree to which the implicate b is implied by the implicant a, p
a
, where the right-hand side symbolizes the real value representing the relative
degree to which a implies b. The inferential utility of this formalism is readily appar-
ent when the implicant is an assertion representing a premise and the implicate is an
assertion representing a hypothesis.

Cox (1979) continues by deﬁning a question in terms of an exhaustive set of asser-
tions, which answer the question. Just as inference was examined using the relationships
among assertions under the action of implication, one can examine inquiry by consid-
ering the bearing that one question may have on another question. The relationships
among questions are symmetric to that of assertions, such that a question A has bearing
on issue B, written A
is the logical and operation
such that A
is the logical or
operation such that A
B is a question that asks what A and B ask in common. As an
example consider two questions A
“Is this my drink?".
The joint question, “Is this my coffee and is this my drink?" asks the same as “Is this my
coffee?", whereas the common question, “Is this my coffee or is this my drink?" asks
what the two questions ask in common, “Is this my drink?". In this example the question
A has bearing on the question B.

B is a question that asks what A and B ask jointly, and

“Is this my coffee?" and B

B, where

, one obtains relationships among questions that are analogous to those among
A
assertions. The bearing of a question on an issue can be written in terms of the en-
tropy using the probabilities of the assertions deﬁning the question and the premise
corresponding to the issue. In this sense, probability quantiﬁes what is known, whereas
entropy quantiﬁes what is not known.

1 Here we adopt the notation used by Cox where an assertion is denoted by a lowercase Roman charac-
ter, and a question is denoted by an uppercase Roman character. Subscripts may be used to distinguish
components of a compound assertion or question. In addition, we adopt the notation used by Fry where as-
sertions are stated with exclamation marks and questions with question marks. Please note that compound
assertions and questions are denoted using boldface block lettering.

SOURCE SEPARATION AS INDUCTIVE INFERENCE

We begin the application of inductive logic by working in the space of assertions and
considering source separation as a problem in inductive inference. To illustrate the
relationships between the techniques, we keep the problem simple by assuming linear,
stationary, noiseless mixing of n source signals recorded by n detectors. The signal
recorded by detector i at time t is given by

xit =

ai js jt

(1)

where the Einstein summation convention is employed with s jt as the jth source signal
at time t and ai j as the mixing matrix element describing the coupling between source j
and detector i. We further assume that the sources are statistically independent and that
we possess some prior knowledge regarding the form of the source amplitude densities,
denoted p

, where h represents the premise (also known as the prior information).

h

s

(

j

)

The model consists of two assertions:

a
s

=

=

“The mixing matrix is a!"
“The source waveforms are s!"

that are utilized with two additional assertions, one stating the observed data
“The recorded mixtures are x!"

x

and one stating the premise

=

h

“Our prior state of knowledge is ... !".

=

Note that the assertions are all compound assertions in the sense that they are conjunc-
tions of more simple assertions. For example, the assertion a regarding the mixing ma-
trix is an assertion composed of the conjunction of n2 assertions regarding the coupling
terms between the sources and the detectors, such that

a

(2)

Similarly, s and x are compound assertions each being the conjunction of nT assertions,
one for each source or detector and for each of the T measurements.

Bayes’ Theorem is used to express the joint posterior probability of the model of the
physical process in terms of the likelihood of the data and the prior probabilities of the
model parameters

This equation, derived in more detail elsewhere (Knuth 1998a,b; 1999), is identical to
the results obtained by Bell & Sejnowski (1995), however it has been derived from the
viewpoint of inductive inference by working in the space of assertions.

SOURCE SEPARATION AS INDUCTIVE INQUIRY

The problem of source separation is now looked at from the viewpoint of inductive
inquiry by working in the space of questions. Dual to the premise h is the issue “What are
the characteristics of this mixing problem?", which we shall denote by H. The questions
we will consider are

S
M
X

=

=

=

“What are the original source signals?"
“What is the mixing matrix?"
“What are the recorded signals?"

X2 ^

Note again that all of these questions are compound questions, where X asks X
X1 ^
Xn with X1 =
for S and M. The question S

“What is the signal recorded in detector 1?" and similarly
M equivalently asks “What is the physical description of

: : :

^

^

(cid:213)
¶
Unfortunately, the question S

M cannot be asked directly, so one must model the

^

source separation problem and ask questions like

Y

=

“How well have we modeled the source activity?"

To do this one considers what the question S

^

questions S, M and Y are related such that if one answers question S
answered question Y. Thus S

M implies Y, and from the deﬁnition of implication

^

^

M has in common with Y. The

ﬁnds that this is equivalent to Bell and Sejnowski’s (1995) eqn 2.1

We now consider how one should vary the modeled mixing matrix, or the separation
matrix, so that the bearing of the common inquiry on the source separation issue can
be maximized. Since the common question “From what has not been recorded by the
detectors, have the source signals have been overestimated?", Y
X, refers to the
source signal components never recorded by the detectors, this inquiry does not depend
on the mixing process, which describes how the source signals are mapped onto the
detectors. So the variation of the bearing of this inquiry on the issue with respect to the
elements of the separation matrix, wi j, is identically zero

The assertion y is a compound assertion consisting of the conjunction of n assertions

which when evaluated gives results identical to those found by working in the space of

results obtained by Bell & Sejnowski (1995) using information theory are related to the
results obtained by Knuth (1998a, b, 1999) using Bayesian inference.

CONCLUSIONS

Shannon’s work dealt with a simpliﬁed case of inductive inquiry where one has a trans-
mitter and is attempting to design a communication channel from the transmitter to the
receiver, equivalently designing a question to be answered by the transmitter. This prob-
lem, which dealt with at most two questions, led to the development of information
theory. Even though the calculus of inductive inquiry in simple cases is identical to in-
formation theory, the logical foundation of the inferential inquiry approach provides a
notation that is based on the logical relations among questions. This leads to relations

¶
¶
that are frequently conceptually more intuitive than their information-theoretic counter-
parts. As an example, where Bell and Sejnowski attribute the conditional entropy in their
equation to the entropy of the noise, we found that it actually represents the effect that
information about the sources not present in the data has on the inquiry. In addition,
there are relationships that can be derived using the inferential calculus that have no
information-theoretic counterpart. As an example, consider the bearing of the common
question A
C on an issue H, which cannot be dealt with in an information-theoretic
framework.

Weaver’s “Recent Contributions" have often gone relatively unnoticed perhaps due to
the fact that he was unable to quantify his impressions of the relationship between infor-
mation theory as derived by Shannon and semantic meaning. This interrelation having
been quantiﬁed by Cox as a duality between the space of assertions (being appropriate
for performing inductive inference and hence determining semantic meaning) and the
space of questions (being appropriate for performing inductive inquiry and hence re-
lated to the choosing of a channel or question for communication) has now been placed
in a theoretical framework that can not only be utilized to understand the relationship
between Bayesian and information-theoretic solutions to solved problems, but also to
approach a host of new and heretofore inaccessible problems. Robert Fry’s work on
inductive logic has greatly expounded on Cox’s initial quantiﬁcation and has demon-
strated the logical foundations of neural network processing and have expanded on their
application (Fry 1995, 1996, 2000).

By now, you will have probably realized that there are several different bearings that
one may wish to maximize, just as there may be different posterior probabilities to be
evaluated. We have looked at one particular question regarding the quality of our source
separation model and found that this reproduces precisely the approach taken by Bell
and Sejnowski using a neural network architecture in conjunction with a minimum mu-
tual information or infomax principle. The connection between the inferential inquiry
approach and the information-theoretic approach sheds some light on the logical basis
of Bell and Sejnowski’s work and on neural network design in general. In addition, the
duality between the logic of assertions and the logic of questions elucidates the rela-
tionship between Bayesian and information-theoretic approaches. However, inductive
inquiry goes far beyond information theory and provides a means to work with the logic
of questions directly. This way of thinking is quite different than that required by the
logic of assertions. To use this new logic effectively will require a paradigm shift in our
thinking about problems. To begin with, there is a need to determine better questions to
answer.

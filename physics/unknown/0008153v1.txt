Abstract 

The  H-  Accelerator  consists  of  a  750  keV  Cockcroft 
Walton  preaccelerator  and  an  Alvarez  type  50  MeV 
linac.  The accelerator has been in operation since 1961.  
Since  1981,  it  has  been  used  as  the  injector  for  the 
Intense  Pulsed  Neutron  Source  (IPNS),  a  national  user 
facility for neutron scattering.  The linac delivers about 
3.5x1012 H- ions per pulse, 30 times per second (30 Hz), 
for  multi-turn  injection  to  a  450  MeV  Rapid  Cycling 
Synchrotron (RCS).  IPNS presently operates about 4,000 
hours per year, and operating when scheduled is critical 
to meeting the needs of the user community.  For many 
years  the  IPNS  injector/RCS  has  achieved  an  average 
reliability  of  95%,  helped 
the 
preaccelerator/linac which has averaged nearly 99%.  To 
maintain and improve system reliability, records need to 
show what each subsystem contributes to the total down 
time.    The  history  of  source  and  linac  subsystem 
reliability,  and  improvements  that  have  been  made  to 
improve reliability, will be described.  Plans to maintain 
or enhance this reliability for at least another ten years of 
operation, will also be discussed.

1  INTRODUCTION 

After  operating  with  200 m s pulses at 0.25 Hz for 15 
years  as  an  injector  for  the  Zero  Gradient  Synchrotron 
(ZGS),  the  linac  repetition  rate  was  increased  to  30  Hz 
with 70 m s pulses in the mid-1970's when it also became 
an  injector  for  the  Rapid  Cycling  Synchrotron  (RCS).  
Direct injection to the ZGS ended in 1979 and the RCS, 
which  was  originally  built  to  be  a  booster  for  the  ZGS, 
became the source of high-energy protons for the Intense 
Pulsed  Neutron  Source  (IPNS),  a  national  user  facility 
for  neutron  scattering.    Since  IPNS  began  operation  in 
1981,  it  has  accumulated  over  60,000  hours  of  30  Hz 
beam  operations.    The  overall  accelerator  reliability 
(beam  hours  versus  scheduled  hours)  exceeds  93%  and 
for the past 10 years, that number is greater than 95%.  
Thoughout, 
reliability  has 
hovered  around  99%,  and  this  has  been  achieved  while 
operating at roughly 30 times its original duty factor.

and 

built 

The linac rf system was the first linac amplifier built 
using  the  7835  triode.    The  rf  amplifier  system  was 
designed 
by  Continental  Electronics 
Corporation in the late 1950's and comprises a single 4-
stage amplifier system with a rated output of 5 MW and 
a  maximum  pulse  length  of  about  200  m s.    With  the 
exception of the power supplies, most of which had to be 
upgraded during the late 1970's when the duty factor was 
increased, the original configuration and in many cases, 
original  equipment,  is  still  functioning  well.    In  the 
almost  40  years  since  startup,  seventeen  new  or  rebuilt 
7835  tubes  have  accumulated  a  total  of  over  200,000 
filament  hours  in  this  single  station,  equivalent  to  over 
23 years of continuous operation. 

2  PREACCELERATOR 

The  preaccelerator  is  a  standard  4-stage  750  kV 
Cockcroft-Walton power supply built by Haefely.  There 
have  been  no  failures  of  the  Haefely  high-voltage 
components in the life of the facility.  The original motor 
generator  set  supplying  400  Hz  ac  to  the  high-voltage 
rectifiers  was  replaced  by  one  made  in  the  USA.    The 
original  400  Hz  isolated  generator  used  for  supplying 
input power to the ion source enclosure was also replaced 
with  a  brushless  60  Hz  unit  to  reduce  maintenance.    It 
has been trouble-free for the past 10 years.   

The  first  ion  source  was  a  proton  source.    This  was 
changed  to  a  modified  duoplasmatron-type H- source in 
1976, and then to the present magnetron-type H- source 
in 1983.  The present source uses cesium to enhance the 
H-  current  and  produces  45-50  mA,  70  microsecond 
beam pulses at the required 30 Hz rate.  It has been very 
reliable and typically is dismantled and cleaned every six 
months,  with  new  electrodes  installed  about  every  year.  
Close control of the cesium flow from the ion source is 
necessary  to  keep  the  spark  rate  of  the  750  kV  column 
low.    However,  proof  of  success  is  the  fact  that  the 
column has not been dismantled in over 14 years. 

log  has  been  computerized. 

Detailed  operating  logs  have  been  kept  since  the 
beginning  of  operation  and  for  the  last  five  years,  the 
trouble 
  Accelerator 
downtime  is  tracked,  rounded  to  the  closest  5  minutes.  
Over the last five years (20,000 hours of beam operation) 
there  were  143  interruptions  of  5  minutes  or  more 
charged  to  the  preaccelerator  and  120  to  the  linac.  
Breakdown by subsystem is given in Tables 1 and 2. 

The  evolution  and  performance  of  the  preaccelerator 
and  linac  was  described  in  a  35th  anniversary  paper 
presented at the Linac96 Conference [1].  In this present 
paper,  we  examine  overall  system  and  subsystem 
reliability  and  the  impact  of  changes  in  hardware  and 
software  on  reliability,  and  discuss  improvements  that

3  LINAC 

The 50 MeV linac is an Alvarez structure, constructed 
as  eleven  sections  that  are  bolted  together  to  form  a 
single  rf  cavity  that  is  0.94  m  in  diameter  and  33.5  m 
long.    There  are  dc  quadrupole  magnets  in  each  of  the 
124  drift  tubes  powered  by  twelve  mag-amp  type  dc 
supplies.    These  units  are  original  to  the  linac  and  are 
nearly  40  years  old. 
  The  change  from  tube  to 
semiconductor regulators in 1988 cleared up most of the 
maintenance  and  failure  problems  with  these  systems.  
The  tank,  drift  tubes  and  quadrupoles  have  been  very 
reliable.  With the exception of a failed interlock and loss 
of  water  flow  in  the  first  eight  quadrupole  magnets  in 
1988  (in  which  external  soft-solder  joints  melted  and 
separated  but  no  noticeable  internal  damage  to  the 
magnet  coils  occurred),  these  systems  have  caused  no 
significant downtime.  Occasional rf arcing in the linac 
tank after vacuum work has generally been cured by mild 
reconditioning,  and  there  is  sufficient  redundancy  of 
vacuum  pumps  that  failures  can  be  left  to  the  next 
scheduled maintenance period for repair. 

Over  the  life  of  the  machine,  there  have  been 
significant  changes  in  the  vacuum  pumps  used  on  both 
the preaccelerator and linac.  Some of the original 2000 
l/s  ion  pumps  are  still  in  use  (after  many  rebuilds  to 
replace  the  titanium  elements  and  bead-blast  internal 
surfaces).  Others have been replaced with cryopumps or 
turbomolecular  pumps  to  increase  pumping  speed  and 
allow operation to continue despite small leaks.  Vacuum 
pump upgrades are expected to continue over the life of 
the  facility  because  improvements  in  vacuum  have 
positive effects on many of the subsystems. 

As is evident from Table 2, the rf transmitter accounts 
for  most  of  the  downtime,  and  over  the  past  five  years 
almost  half  the  downtime  for  the  preaccelerator/linac 
combined is caused by two components, the dc blocking 
capacitors in the triode cavity.  These capacitors, which 
are custom made by Continental Electronics and unique 
 

times. 

  Although  average 

to  our  transmitter,  only  became  a  problem  after  the 
change to 30 Hz operation.  However, in the past twenty 
years,  the  upper  capacitor  has  failed  16  times  and  the 
lower  10 
lifetimes  are 
approximately 25 and 40 operating weeks for the upper 
and  lower  capacitors  respectively,  the  range  is  broad.  
There was a period from 1987 through 1995 (170 weeks) 
with no failures, whereas others have failed after only a 
few weeks.  Frequency of failures have been higher over 
the past few years, possibly due to higher-order modes in 
the  cavity  and  to  difficulties  the  manufacturer  is 
encountering in maintaining a rebuild capability for such 
limited-demand items.

The 7835 triode amplifier tubes used in our linac and 
at several other accelerator facilities (e.g., LANL, FNAL) 
were  originally  developed  and  manufactured  by  RCA 
Corporation.  For many years, the only supplier for these 
tubes has been Burle Industries, a small company set up 
by some former employees of RCA.  Lifetime of the tubes 
is  a  significant  operational  consideration because of the 
high item cost (of order $150,000 for a new tube and half 
that if the failed tube can be repaired) and delivery times 
are  6  to  12  months.    Since  startup  in  1961,  we  have 
accumulated over 200,000 filament hours on 17 new or 
rebuilt  tubes.  In the early years of the facility, most of 
the tubes failed during operation because of grid-cathode 
shorts.    Lifetimes  varied  from  3,000  to  17,000  hours 
(10,000 hours average) for the eight tubes that developed 
shorts,  and  each  resulted  in  downtime  to  install  and 
condition  the  new  tube.    A  manufacturing  change  by 
RCA  about  1970  cured  the  grid-cathode  short  problem, 
and  now  the  tubes  last  until  the  cathode  degrades.  
Cathodes  degrade  gradually,  giving  several  months 
during  which  the  heater  current  can  be  periodically 
increased  to  maintain  sufficient  emission  and  providing 
time  to  schedule  the  replacement  during  a  maintenance 
period.    Nine  tubes  have  been  replaced  because  of  low 
emission  with  lifetimes  ranging  from  9,000  to  20,000 
hours  (15,000  hours  average).    The  only  downtime 
charged to the tubes in the last five years was a 4.5 hour 
interruption  in  1997,  a  few  days  after  a  blocking-
capacitor  failure,  when  the  tube  developed  an  external 
arc  (carbon  track  on  the  ceramic).    The  tube  was 

their  experiments  are  much  increased.    Also,  the  short 
nature of individual experiments means that one cannot 
compensate for a lost day of beam by operating at 10% 
higher  current  for  the  next  10  days.    Thus  for  IPNS, 
mean-time-to-repair  is  at  least  as  important  as  total 
downtime. 

The  challenge  posed  five  years  ago,  of  increasing 
operation from the previous level of 15-17 weeks per year 
to  25  or  greater  without  impacting  reliability,  has  been 
met.  Present plans call for a further increase to about 30 
weeks  per  year.    Additional  pressures  on  reliability  are 
that  several  systems,  specifically 
the  high-voltage 
regulator and pulsed bouncer for the preaccelerator, and 
the driver stage for the 7835 power triode in the linac rf 
system, will have to be replaced because the tubes used in 
these units are no longer available.  As it is probable that 
the  new  systems  will  result  in  an  initial  increase  in 
downtime, it will be important to aggressively attack the 
linac rf capacitor problem which now accounts for about 
half of our total downtime.  The pressurized cavities used 
for  the  7835  tubes  at  FNAL  and  LANL  are  a  possible 
solution,  but  could  not  be  installed  in  the  8-10  week 
summer  shutdown  of  our  present  operating  schedule.  
Therefore we are hoping that our present work with the 
manufacturer to develop a more robust capacitor, coupled 
with  our  work  to  decrease  higher-order  modes  in  the 
cavity, will provide relief. 

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 

The authors strongly believe that the reliability of the 
IPNS accelerator systems is primarily attributable to the 
designers,  subsystem  managers,  engineers,  technicians 
and  operators  who  have  systematically  eliminated  the 
weak components and have developed maintenance and 
operating  techniques  that  provide  rapid  detection  and 
repair  when  failures  occur.    Their  response  to  calls,  at 
any  hour  of  the  day  or  night,  is  what  keeps  our  mean-
time-to-repair manageable.

 4  DISCUSSION 

IPNS  operation  increased  about  five  years  ago  to  its 
present  level  of  about  25  weeks  per  year.    During 
operating  periods,  typically  two  to  three  weeks  on  with 
one  to  two  weeks  off  between  runs,  the  facility  is 
expected  to  run  24  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week.  
External  users  come  for  periods  of  a  couple  days  to  a 
week  or  more  to  make  measurements  on  samples 
requiring  individual  exposure  times  that  vary  from  less 
than  an  hour  to  several  days.    In  general,  beam 
interruptions  of  half  an  hour  or  less  are  relatively 
insignificant  to  users  unless  they  are  frequent.    Even 
then, the main effect is a lack of throughput proportional 
to the lost beam (equivalent to operating continuously at 
reduced  proton  current  on  target).    Long  interruptions, 
particularly those exceeding eight hours, may mean that 
the user’s samples don’t all get exposed or statistics are 
poor and the user may get ambiguous or uninterpretable 
data.  There have been only five beam interruptions from 
preaccelerator/linac  faults  over  the  last  five  years  that 
exceeded eight hours and the longest was 20 hours.  All 
were  associated  with  blocking-capacitor  failures.    The 
average  preaccelerator/linac 
(percent  of 
scheduled  time  when  protons  were  delivered  to  target) 
was 98.8% and half of the total downtime was associated 
with blocking-capacitor failures.  Downtime of all IPNS 
accelerator systems over the past 12 years (including the 
preaccelerator/linac) is shown in Figure 1.  Overall, the 
preaccelerator/linac  accounted  for  about  one  quarter  of 
the total accelerator downtime.

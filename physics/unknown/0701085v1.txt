Abstract 

A micro time-projection-chamber (micro-TPC) with a detection volume of 23×28×31 cm3 was developed, and its fundamental performance 
was examined. The micro-TPC consists of a micro pixel chamber with a detection area of 31×31 cm2 as a two-dimensional imaging device 
and a gas electron multiplier with an effective area of 23×28 cm2 as a pre-gas-multiplier. The micro-TPC was operated at a gas gain of 
50,000, and energy resolutions and spatial resolutions were measured.

1. Introduction 

2. Large-volume micro-TPC 

Large  volume  time  projection  chambers  (TPC)  have 
been  developed  for  various  applications[1,2,3].  Micro 
patterned  gaseous  detectors,  such  as  a  gas  electron 
multiplier  (GEM)  [4],  a  micromegas[5]  and  a  micro  pixel 
chamber[6],  are  thought  to  improve  the  spatial  resolutions 
of  TPCs.  Previously,  we  have  developed  a  micro-time-
projection-chamber    (micro-TPC) with  a detection  volume 
of  10×10×8  cm3  [7]  based  on  a  micro  pixel  chamber  (μ-
PIC) with a detection area of 10×10 cm2. This micro-TPC 
proved several conceptual ideas for such applications as an 
electron-tracking  Compton  camera  [8],  a  dark  matter 
detector [9], and a neutron-imaging detector [10]. In order 
to achieve the physical goals of these applications, we now 
have  developed  a  larger  volume  micro-TPC  based  on  a 
large-size  μ-PIC  with  a  detection  area  of  31×31  cm2  [11] 
and  a  large-size    gas  electron  multiplier  (GEM)  with  an 
effective area of 23×28 cm2. In this paper, the fundamental 
large-volume  micro-TPC  with  a 
performance  of 
detection volume of 23×28×31 cm3 is described.

2.1. Large-area μ-PIC and large-area GEM 

A  second  generation  large-area  μ-PIC  with  a  detection 
area of 31×31 cm2 was used for this micro-TPC (TOSHIBA, 
S/N  20060222-3).  The  production  yield  was  increase  to 
90%  as  the  result  of  an  improvement  of  the  plating 
technology. The fractions of dead and bad anode electrodes 
were  decreased  to  less  than  0.1%.  The  operation  gas  gain 
of  the  μ-PIC    was  about  5000.  The  production  yield,  the 
fraction  of  the  dead  and  bad  electrodes,  and  the  operation 
gas gain of the first production μ-PICs were 50%,  5%, and 
3500, respectively [11].  

A gas  electron  multiplier  (GEM) with  an  effective  area 
of 23×28 cm2 was developed as a pre-multiplication device 
of  the  micro-TPC.  The  GEM  was  made  by  a  Japanese 
company,  Scienergy  Co.  Ltd.  The  size  was  currently 
restricted  by  the  working  size  for  the  fabrication.  Copper 
electrodes  were  formed  on  both  sides  of  the  polyimide 
insulator. The holes were 50 μm in diameter and were place 
with  a  pitch  of  140 μm.  We  supplied  a  voltage  of  470  V 
between  the  top  electrode  and  the  bottom  electrode  of  the 
GEM  in  a  dry  nitrogen  gas  atmosphere  for  30  minutes 

3. Performance  

3.1. Gas gains 

The  gas  gains  were  measured  by  irradiating  the  micro-
TPC  with  X-rays  from  a  radioactive  source  of  109Cd.  We 
calculated  the  collected  charge  from  the  flash-ADC  data, 
while the corresponding event position was known from the 
digital  hit data. In order  to  evaluate  any  inhomogeneity  of 
the  gas  gains  of  the  whole  detection  area,  we  divided  the 
detection  area into 6×8  parts,  and  calculated  the gas gain 
for  each  part.  The  ratio  of  the  maximum  gas  gain  to  the 
minimum one was 2.2. The gas gains at the gain-maximum 
area, measured with several voltages supplied to the anode 
electrodes  of  the  μ-PIC  (Vμ-PIC)  and  several  voltages 
supplied to the GEM (ΔVGEM =VGEMT-VGEMB), are shown in 
Fig. 2. The internal gas gain of the μ-PIC operated without 
the GEM is shown for a comparison [11]. The internal gain 
without  the  GEM  was  about  5000.  When  we  increased 
ΔVGEM, higher total gas gains were observed. A gas gain of 
50,000 was achieved with a μ-PIC voltage of 520 V and a 
GEM voltage of 260 V. This was the required gas gain for 
tracking  the  minimum  ionizing  particles  (MIPs)  with  a 
400μm-pitch  detector.  We  therefore  operated  the  micro-
TPC with these voltages in the following measurements.

before  use.  This  aging  process  prevented  the  GEM  from 
serious discharges. 

 A  dedicated  readout  system  for  the  micro-TPC  was 
developed [12].  TPC signals read  by 768  anode-strips  and 
768  cathode-strips  were  digitized  in  amplifier  shaper 
discriminator (ASD) chips [13], synchronized in a position 
encoding  system  at  100  MHz  clock,  and  recorded  by  a 
VME-bus memory-board. Each digital signal or “hit” was a 
set of (Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, Ymax, T), where Xmin and Xmax were 
the  minimum  and  maximum  positions  of  the  anode  strips, 
which  detected  the  TPC  signals,  Ymin,  Ymax  were  those  of 
the  cathode  strips,  and  T  was  the  clock  counter.  The 
position and a size of an electron cloud (400 μm/digit), and 
the  elapsed  time  from  the  trigger  of  each  hit  (10  ns/digit) 
were  recorded,  so  that  a  track  of  a  charged  particle  was 
recorded  as  successive  hits.  TPC  signals  read  by  768 
cathode-strips  were  amplified  in  the  ASD  chips  and  were 
summed  into  eight  channels  (each  channel  had  96  strips), 
and  their  waveforms  were  recorded  by  a  100  MHz  flash-
ADC. The energy deposition of a charged particle was thus 
known from the detected waveforms. 

2.2.  Large-volume micro-TPC 

A schematic drawing of the micro-TPC is shown in Fig. 
1. The micro-TPC had a drift length of 31 cm, which made 
a detection volume of 23×28×31 cm3. The gas volume was 
set  in  an  aluminum  vessel  filled  with  a  normal-pressure 
argon-ethane gas mixture (9:1). A drift voltage of -7.5 kV 
was supplied to the drift plane (VDRIFT=7.5kV), which made 
a drift electric field of 0.23 kV/cm. The voltage of the top 
plane of the GEM was set at -660 V (VGEMT=660 V), which 
was  reconciled  with  the  voltage  of  the  shaping  pattern  at 
the  corresponding  drift  length.  The  voltage  of  the  bottom 
plane  of  the  GEM  was  determined  by  the  GEM  voltage 
(VGEMB = VGEMT -ΔVGEM). The distance between the GEM 
and the μ-PIC was 5 mm.

ADC  data  were  summed  with  an  energy  correction 
corresponding  to  the  event  position  to  compensate  the 
inhomogeneity  of  the  gas  gains.  We  can  see  the  peak  of 
direct X-rays at 31 keV and the peak of copper fluorescent 
X-rays  from  the  GEM  and  the  μ-PIC  at  8.0  keV.  The 
energy  resolutions  were  measured  for  the  energy  range 
between  8  keV  and  60  keV  with  radioactive  sources  of 
109Cd,  133Ba,  and  241Am.  The  measured  energy  resolutions 
are  shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  energy  resolution  was  60% 
FWHM for 60 keV γ-rays. An improvement of the plating 
technology  is  expected  to  bring  the  energy  resolution  at 
worst to 30%, which we achieved with a 10 cm micro-TPC.

3.3. Position resolution 

We  measured  the  three-dimensional  position  resolution 
of  the  micro-TPC  by  cosmic-ray  muons.  We  placed  two 
plastic  scintillators  (30×30×1  cm3)  above  and  below  the 
micro-TPC. The micro-TPC was triggered by a coincidence 
signal of these two scintillators.  

First,  we  measured  the  drift  velocity.  The  maximum 
time  was  7.3  μs,  which  indicates  a  drift  velocity  of  4.2 
cm/μs,  taking  account  of  the  corresponding  drift  length  of

tracks 
reconstructed with the measured drift velocity are shown in

the  residual  was  calculated  for  each  hit  point.  Here,  the 
residual was defined as the distance between a hit point and 
the fitted straight line. The hit points were divided into 31 
groups  by  their  drift  length  and  we  plotted  the  residual 
distribution for each group. The residual distribution for the 
hits  of  l=5.5±0.5  cm  is  plotted  in  Fig.  6.  Each  residual 
distribution  was 
two-dimensional

where A is the normalizing factor, r is the residual and  σ2 
is  the  dispersion  of  the  Gaussian.  We  obtained  σ=1.0  mm 
for l=5.5±0.5 cm. σ was expected to be the root sum square 
of the detector intrinsic term, σdetector, and the diffusion term, 
σdiffusion, as shown in equation (2).

Therefore  σ  was  plotted  as  a  function  of  l  (Fig.  7),  and 
fitted  with  equation  (2).  As  a  result  of  the  fitting, 
σdetector=0.51  mm  and  D=0.37  mm·cm-1/2  were  obtained. 
The  detector  intrinsic  term  was  worse  than  the  value  of 
0.37  mm  that  we  measured  with  a  10-cm  micro-TPC[11]. 
The distortion of the spatial resolution could be due to the 
inhomogeneity of the anode electrodes. The diffusion term 
is  reasonable  when  we  consider  that  the  transverse 
diffusion  is  0.5  mm·cm-1/2  and  the  center  position  of  the 
digital hit positions was calculated.

4. Prospects 

Development  issues  for  applications  were  found  from 
the  above  measurements.  For 
the  electron-tracking 
Compton camera, we need to widen the energy range up to 
about 200 keV. High-energy peaks will be observed by an 
improvement  of 
the  energy  resolution.  The  plating 
technology,  which  is  still  being  improved,  is  expected  to 
produce  more  homogeneous  anode  electrodes  in  the  next 
production.  This  will  improve  the  homogeneity  of  the  gas 
gain,  and  thus  the  energy  resolution  will  improve.  The 
angular  resolutions  and  the  detection  efficiency  of  the 
Compton  camera  are  expected  to  be  improved.  For  a  dark 
matter  search  experiment,  stable  operation  with  a  lower 
pressure  gas  of  a  few  tens  of  torr  should  be  confirmed.  A 
better  spatial  resolution  is  expected  with  CF4  gas,  which 
will  help  to  improve  the  sensitivity  to  dark  matters. 
Operation  with  3He  gas  will  show  potential  for  the  time-
resolved neutron imaging detector. 

 

5. Conclusions 

A micro-TPC with a detection volume of 23×28×31 cm3 
was developed. The micro-TPC was operated at a gas gain 
of  50,000  and  an  energy  resolution  of  60%  FWHM  at  60 
keV  was  measured.  We  detected  tracks  of  MIPs  with  the 
micro-TPC  and  a  three-dimensional  position  resolution  of  
0.51 mm was measured.

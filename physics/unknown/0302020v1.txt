The solution of a momentum conservation equation for the gas and liquid stream in the flowing 
element  is  obtained  on  the  basis  of  the  modern  approach  to  a  problem  on  contact  interaction  of 
bodies and mediums. A flowing element, system are: pipe, tube, orifice, mouthpiece, diffuser, etc. 
and its combination. The integration of the differential equation has reduced to distribution law of 
static head along the length of flowing element and has proved the elementary algebraic solution 
that  introduced  in  the  previous  paper  by  these  authors.  The  received  solution  allows  to  describe 
the motion of fluid medium in non-stationary conditions, under action of any time-varying physi-
cal factors: a roughness of streamlined surface, the area of the section of the flowing element, the 
heat exchange with the streamlined surface, the technical work, the additional weight flow of fluid 
medium.

1 Introduction 
 
The problem of the solution of the momentum con-
servation  equation  for  stream  of  fluid  medium  in 
the flowing element has occurred from the moment 
of its publication by Euler in 1755. This problem is 
bound with question: what its solution means? And 
this problem, in turn, has demanded clearing up of 
the  physical  meaning  contained  in  the  given  equa-
tion.  If  the  equation  describes  motion  of  an  ideal 
fluid  medium  as  Euler  and  his  following  consid-

ered, then there is question: what is physical reason 
of  the  change  of  the  relation  between  two  compo-
nents  of equation in its left-hand side with conser-
vation of equality of its total to zero value? Appar-
ently,  the  medium  which  is  not  having  the  inside 
structural  kinematic  and  dynamic  linkage  can  not 
change  parameters  of  motion.  The  stream  of  the 
fluid  medium  which  is  not  possessing  the  above 
mentioned  property,  can  be  considered  only  as  a 
whole  with  stationary values of motion parameters 
in  all  its  parts  by  analogy  with  the  Newton's  first 
law.  All  the  more,  such  medium  is  not  capable  to 
interact  by  contact  with  an  environment.  It  is  im-
possible  neither  to  understand  sense  of  Euler's 
equation,  nor  to  decide  its  productively  owing  to 
the physical insignificancy of such medium, termed 
ideal fluid. 

In the XX century, the attempt of substitution in the 
left-hand side of Euler's equation of the static head 
losses  along  the  length  of  pipe  in  accordance  of 
Weissbach-Darcy’s  formula  was  undertaken  after 
experimental  determination  of  allocation  of  static 
head  in  fluid  flow  in  pipe.  This  means  should  en-
sure the conversion to consideration of an real fluid 
medium  possessing  such  inside  structural  property 
as  viscosity  and  capable  to  response  to  external 
actions  on  thought  of  the  hydrodynamic  scientists 
of  the  XX  centuries.  However  and  this  means was 
unproductive.  The  introduction  in  Euler's  equation 
of  the  third  member,  nonzero,  physically  means 
what alongside with kinetic and potential energy in 
the  stream  of  fluid  medium  is  contained  a  certain 

 
 
 
 
third  type  of  energy  that  is  related  to  the  contact 
interaction of the stream with a streamlined surface. 
Euler’s  equation  has  ceased  to  be  the  equation  as 
such  both  physically  and  mathematically  in  this 
form.  Thus,  the  problem  of  productive  usage  of 
Euler's  equation  as  one  of  the  basic  equations  for 
exposition of fluid medium dynamics is, that during 
its solution:

to retain its form of record; 
to  take  into  account  mathematically  correctly 
influence of contact interaction on a relation of 
kinetic and potential energy, which varies along 
the  length  of  stream  but,  the  aggregate  content 
of  this  two  types  of  energy  is  remained  invari-
able; 
to know that the solution should give the poten-
tial distribution, that is the static head in stream 
along  the  length  of  flowing  element  according 
to Torricelli-Galilei-Borda-Du Buat (TGBD) re-
lationship  for free fall and Bernoulli's principle 
about correspondence of relation of kinetic and 
potential energy of fluid flow in the pipe to this 
relation for free fall of solid in the gravitational 
field.

Such solution of the momentum conservation equa-
tion should have an as much as possible generalized 
form  for  stream  of  gas  medium  with  the  particular 
form  for  liquid.  At  the  same  time  both  solutions 
will  appear  fundamental  for  gas  dynamics  and  hy-
drodynamics accordingly.

So, after almost 250 years the Euler’s partial differ-
ential equation looks like:

Basing on the conception about contact interaction 
of fluid flow with the streamline surface, it is nec-
essary to write up the equation (1) in the form: 

[

(2) 

where  p  is static head distributed along the length 
of  the  pipe  proportionally  to  intensity  of  contact 
interaction of stream with wall. 

Out of the equation (2) follows:

lp

(3) 

 

The  value  of  the  constant  is  determined  out  of  re-
quirements    V=0,    p=p0,    with  allowance  for 
which  one  the  equation  (3)  acquires  particular 
form:

The  intensity  of  contact  interaction  of  the  stream 
with the wall is expressed by dependence: 

( )

(5) 

what will match the differential form of writing of 
Weissbach-Darcy's  formula  for  the  stream  of  the 
fluid  medium  in  pipe.  The  integration  of  the  ex-
pression (5) gives the allocation of static head along 
the  length  of  pipe  accordingly  to  the  intensity  of 
contact interaction of stream with wall in the form:

(6) 

where an actual longitudinal coordinate,  l  needs to 
be  counted  out  from  the  outlet section of the pipe. 
The  integration  constant  C  in  the  equation  (6)  is 
determined  out  of  conditions  l  =  0,  p  =  ph.  In 
result,  C = ph  and equation (6) acquires the form: 

( )
lp

In  result  of  substitution  (7)  in  (4),  and  taking  into

account  

 , we now have:

in turn, having substituted (8) in (7), we receive the

of the flowing element:

3 Concluding remarks 
 
Thus,  later  almost  250  years,  the  physically  ade-
quate and the mathematically correct solution of the 
equation is obtained which is one of the fundamen-
tal  relationship  in  the  field  of  gas  dynamics  and 
hydrodynamics.  The  solution  of  momentum  con-
servation  equation  for  stream  of  fluid  medium  in 
flowing  element  in  differential  form  match  to  its 
elementary algebraic solution [1] what confirms the 
uniqueness  of  the  solution.  At  the  same  time  the 
differential  approach  has  allowed  to  receive  the 
solution  suitable  for  description  of  motion  of  fluid 
medium  in  non-stationary  conditions,  under  action 
of  any  time-varying  physical  factors:  a  roughness 
of streamlined surface, the area of the section of the 
flowing  element,  the  heat  exchange  with  the 
streamlined  surface,  the  technical  work,  the  addi-
tional weight flow of fluid medium.

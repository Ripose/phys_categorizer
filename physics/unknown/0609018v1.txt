This paper describes a new way to reconstruct and identify muons with high efficiency and high pion rejection.     Since muons 

at the ILC are often produced with or in jets, for many of the physics channels of interest[1], an efficient algorithm to deal with 

the identification and separation of particles within jets is important.  The algorithm at the core of the method accounts for the 

effects of the magnetic field and for the loss of energy by charged particles due to ionization in the detector.  We have chosen 

to  develop  the  analysis  within  the  setup  of  one  of  the  Linear  Collider  Concept  Detectors  adopted  by  the  US.  Within  b-pair 

production jets, particles cover a wide range in momenta; however ~ 80% of the particles have a momentum below 30 GeV[2].  

Our  study,  focused  on  bbar-b  jets,  is  preceded  by  a  careful  analysis  of  single  energy  particles  between  2  and  50  GeV.  As 

medium  energy  particles  are  a  substantial  component  of  the  jets,  many  of  the  particles  lose  part  of  their  energy  in  the 

calorimeters and the solenoid coil before reaching the muon detector where they may have energy below 2 GeV. To deal with 

this problem we have implemented a Runge-Kutta correction of the calculated trajectory to better handle these lower energy 

particles. The  multiple scattering and other stochastic processes,  more important at lower energy, is addressed by a Kalman-

filter  integrated  into  the  reconstruction  algorithm.  The  algorithm  provides  a  unique  and  powerful  separation  of  muons  from 

pions. The 5 Tesla magnetic field from a solenoid surrounds the hadron calorimeter and allows the reconstruction and precision 

momentum measurement down to a few GeV.  

1.  INTRODUCTION  

We describe a muon identification procedure that involves a comparison of the charged track trajectory reconstructed 

in the tracking systems with the location of energy deposits detected in the calorimeters and the muon detectors. This 

comparison  requires  that  the  track  trajectory  is  extrapolated  beyond  the  tracking  detectors.  Our  initial  extrapolation 

method, the swimmer, was based on a helical extrapolation of the track assuming constant angular velocity.  While this 

is  an  acceptable  approximation  for  high  momentum  tracks,  it  fails  at  the  low  and  medium  momentum  end  of  the 

spectrum where the energy loss and multiple scattering cause significant deviation of the actual track trajectory from an 

ideal helix, the discrepancy being amplified by the bending effect in the strong magnetic field. 

The stepper, an improved software package, uses an analytical procedure to propagate the charged track determined 

from the vertex and silicon tracking systems through the calorimeters and solenoid in small steps accounting for dE/dx 

and 

Bvq

effects  [3]  at  each  step.  The  stepper  improves  the  identification  and  reconstruction  efficiency  of  low 

energy  muons  from  0.06%  at  3GeV  to  33%  (see  table  2).  When  a  Runge-Kutta  correction  is  applied  to  the  stepper 

algorithm the match  between the projected track  and hits in  the calorimeters and  muon  detector further improves the 

Finally  a  Kalman  filter  stepper  has  been  developed  which  improves  further  the  results  by  taking  into  account 

multiple scattering, Bremsstrahlung and decays. This paper describes the general principles of the muon reconstruction

package and its implementation.   

The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a proposed electron-positron accelerator complex to facilitate the study of 

electroweak symmetry breaking at a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV. The e+ and e- beams are separately accelerated 

to high energy by a series of ~ 4000 superconducting (SC) RF cavities in 15 km tunnels on either side of the interaction 

point (IP) where they are then brought into collision via a beam delivery system.    

1   

 
  
 
 

The  IP  is  surrounded  by  a  collection  of  detectors  that  track  and  measure  the  energies  of  the  out-going  particles 

created in the e+e- collisions.    The detectors are arranged to accurately measure the position and direction of outgoing 

charged particles, their momenta, and their energies and to identify hadrons, leptons and missing energy that is typically 

the hallmark of neutrinos that interact so weakly that they leave none of their energy in the detectors.  Electromagnetic 

and  hadronic  calorimeters  are  used  to  identify  electrons/photons  and  hadrons,  respectively.   Muons  are  identified  by 

their penetration through the tracking and calorimeter detectors where they lose small amounts of detectable energy by 

their  ionization  of  the  material  media  through  which  they  pass.   The  muon  identification  proceeds  primarily  via  the 

observation of ionization energy that is observed after electrons, photons and hadrons have converted all their energy in 

We will start by a short description of the detector which will be followed by a detailed study of the algorithm and its 

upstream material. 

improvements described above. 

2.  THE DETECTOR  

The  detector  has  five  main  sub-detectors:  The  vertex  sub-detector  is  composed  of  a  central  barrel  system  with  five 

layers and forward systems composed of four disks.    The tracker is composed of five cylindrical barrels and five disk-

shaped  end  planes.  The  electro-magnetic  calorimeters  have  30  layers  of  0.25cm  Tungsten  and  0.05cm  Si-detectors 

(supplemented by 0.1cm air and 0.1cm G10) for a 0.5cm layer thickness; the hadron calorimeter has 34 layers each with 

2cm  steel  and  1cm  polystyrene,  and  finally  the  postulated  muon  detector  has  32  layers  with  5cm  Fe  plates  and  32 

instrumented gaps of scintillators. A total of 240cm of iron is needed for the SC magnet flux return, of which 32 layers 

are instrumented  as a  muon detector. The detector is represented  in  Table 1  in  terms  of radiation  lengths, interaction 

lengths and dE/dx

3.  THE STEPPER 

The stepper starts with a particle at the IP and it computes step-wise the particle trajectory throughout the complete 

detector.   A  uniform  axial  magnetic  field  Bz  is  assumed  up  to  the  coil  itself.  The  momentum  components  px  and  py 

undergo  changes  due  to  the  q  v×B  term  whereas  the  energy  loss  in  material  contributes  to  a  reduction  of  all  the 

components of particle momentum. 

3.1.The Parametrization  

Each component of the momentum changes at each step. There is a momentum change

px(Bz),  py(Bz), due to the 

magnetic  field,  and  one  of  px(material)= x,  py(material)=  y,  pz(material)= 

z  due  to  energy  loss  by  ionization  in 

material.    

 In the equations below, q is the charge, Bz the magnetic field, dt(n) the time spent and ds the path length in one step.  

The algorithm for determining the particles trajectory including energy loss is given by the equations below. In these 

equations, q is the charge, Bz  the magnetic field, dt(n) the time spent and ds the path length in one step.

         In the next figure are represented the 4 stages of the particle at each step in the stepper. Those 4 stages are 

repeated N times if the stepper is called N times for a particular layer of the subdetector. The particle is 

represented by a point in the phase-space {x, y, z, px, py, pz). The 4 stages are described below

The output {x, y, z, px, py, pz)  becomes the new input data for the next layer or the next subdetector. 

3.2.The Muon Candidate 

The muon identification algorithm requires a well fitted charged track consistent with the observed energy deposits in 

EM  and  HAD  calorimeters  and  at  least  12  hits  /12  layers  within  an  extrapolated  ( , 

)  road  in  the  muon  detector. 

Calorimetric  cells  are  associated  with  a  track  if  they  are  within  2  angular  bins  in  the  EM  calorimeter  and  the  muon 

detector or 3 angular bins in the HAD calorimeter,  ( 

= =  /840 in ECal

, 

= =  /600 in HCal,  

= = 

/150 in the muon detector). The current version of the muon ID package is restricted to the barrel detector, 

defined as 0.95rad< <2.2rad. 

Figure 3- Evolution  of  (px/pIP, py/pIP)  through the sub-detectors, with   pIP,  the magnitude of the particle  
momentum at the IP.

Figure 3 shows muons of different energies produced perpendicular to the beamline (neglecting the small crossing angle 

of the beams). In this case the particle trajectory takes place in the transverse plane. It is shown here in the (px, py) plane 

to convey the essential information. In the vertex detector and the tracker, where the amount of material is negligible, 

5  

 
  

we see that  (px  px + py 

 py)/ pIP ~ 1. It is the direction of the momentum which varies (as a result of the magnetic field) 

and  not  its  magnitude;  therefore,  the  track  remains  on  the  circumference  of  the  circle.   As  the  particle  enters  the 

calorimeters  the  amount  of  material  encountered  increases  significantly  and  the  particle  starts  to  lose  energy. 

Correspondingly, the trajectory in (px/pIP, py/pIP) plane  moves toward the center of the circle the radius decreases. The 

radius represents the ratio between the magnitude of the particle momentum  to its magnitude at the IP. 

As the particle enters the HCal it loses even more energy than in Ecal  since (  ((dE/dx) L ) is bigger and it goes on 

losing energy in the coil and Mudet.   

In Mudet, because the magnetic field is inverted and smaller in magnitude, the particle changes its bending direction.  

For energies at or below 3 GeV/c., the point (px/pIP, py/pIP) ends up at the center of the circle the particle having lost all 

its energy by dE/dx. The 4 GeV/c muon is left with ~10% of its momentum at the limit of the instrumented muon 

detector, and the higher the muon momentum the smaller the proportion of momentum loss, as can be seen in the plot 

for 10GeV/c and 20 GeV/c Muons.   For a particle coming in with a shallow angle, e.g.   ~0.95 rad  the path-length, 

L, is increased by almost a factor of 2 , (1/cos ) and so is the loss of energy by ionization ((dE/dx)* L). This affects 

particles in the range from 3 to 5 GeV which end up with a momentum close to zero depending on the amount of 

material they pass through. 

3.3.Improvement in Track Reconstruction  

We  have  compared  the  performance  of  the  muon  identification  algorithm  using  the  stepper  with  that  of  the  original 

package  of  R.  Markeloff  which  was  using  the  standard  swimmer  for  the  track  extrapolation  to  the  calorimeters  and 

muon detectors. The swimmer approach does not account for the energy loss in the calorimeters, hence it fails for low 

and  medium  momenta  muons.  We  have  improved  its  performance  for  the  low  momentum  tracks  by  introducing 

momentum-dependent  cuts,  (

,  

~  1/p),

on  the  distance  between  the  extrapolated  track  and  the  calorimeter/muon 

detector cell. This version of the package is denoted as  Swimmer + Ad Hoc dE/dx  in the figure below.. 

In  Figure  4  and  Table  2  are  shown  the  muon ID  efficiency  improvement  with  the  evolution  of  the  algorithm  for 

single muons from 3GeV to 50 GeV.

The histogram in Figure 5 shows the angular deviation of the observed hit from the extrapolated track trajectory in

at 

different depths (layer number) in the muon detector.   ( Track- Hits) for 20 GeV muons (left) is typically ~one  bin 

wide whereas   ( Track- Hits) for a 4 GeV muon is ~ 4 times larger. The remaining inefficiency at low muon 

momentum is primarily due to the stochastic nature of processes not accounted for by the stepper, e.g. multiple 

scattering, Beamstrahlung or decays.

4.  THE MUON IDENTIFICATION IN JETS  

  Reconstruction and identification of single muons is a relatively easy task. The more difficult, albeit more realistic, 

case  involves  muon  identification  in  high  energy  jets.  In  such  an  environment,  in  addition  to  the  issue  of  the 

identification efficiency, we encounter an issue of the purity of the  muon  sample. Most of particles in jets are hadrons, 

hence even with small probability of misidentification the fake muons may overwhelm the muon candidates . To study 
these issues we have generated a sample of 10,000 b-quark pair events produced in e+ e- collisions at the center of mass 

energy up to 500 GeV.  

Table 3 shows a breakdown of generated charged particles in this sample. Particles below 3 GeV do not penetrate the 

muon detector, hence they cannot be identified as muons by our algorithm.  

We also notice that only 34% of the pions in the table have a momentum at or above 3 GeV/c whereas almost 70% of 

the muons are produced at or above 3 GeV/c in heavy flavor b-jets and will therefore reach the muon detector. 

In  absolute  value  though,  the  number  of  pions  above  3  GeV  which  can  reach  the  muon  detector  overcomes  the 

number of muons by a factor 16 and the number of kaons by a factor 4. Of course the fact that hadrons interact  in HCal 

will be helpful in filtering them out from Mudet. 

7     

 
  
 
 

In figure 6 is shown the momentum distribution of muons and pions generated at or above 3 GeV/c in bbar-b jets and 

those pions and muons after detection using our algorithm. One can see that among those 787 muons above 3GeV/c, 

almost 300 have a momentum below 7.5 GeV/c, of which 200 muons have a momentum even below 5 GeV. Most of 

those  muons,  depending  on  their  incoming  azimuthal  angle  will  be  left  with  less  than  2  GeV/c  at  the  end  of  their 

trajectory  in the muon detector.

We  now  focus  mainly  on  the  simulated  muons  of  lower  momenta,  which  are  ~30%  of  the  data  that  reach  the  muon

4.2.Muon Identification with the Improved Method  

A significant fraction of hadron-induced showers produce charged particles that reach the muon detectors where they 

are classified as muons by the muon identification algorithm described earlier. In figure 6 one observes that 323 pions 

passed  the  algorithm  and  are  identified  wrongly  as  muons  (in  green  on  the  figure).  The  number  of  such  false  muon 

candidates has increased with improved reconstruction. More of the medium and low energy particles get reconstructed, 

which  further  improves  the  detection  efficiency  that  has  already  increased  by  using  the  stepper.  This  rate  can  be 

reduced by exploiting the patterns of hadron showers in HCal compared to the minimum ionizing signals left by muons. 

The muon has two main characteristic properties:  

1) The muon leaves a repetitive pattern (1 to 2 hits per cell) in all sub-detectors.  

2) The muon travels through the sub-detectors without strong interactions.  

The  hadrons  do  not  typically  exhibit  these  properties.  Hadrons  characteristically  interact,  which  gives  them  an 

irregular hit pattern during part of their trajectory in HCal, and as a consequence, they don t reach the end of the hadron 

calorimeter. To improve our cuts, we eliminate those hadrons that interact in HCal.  To eliminate those hadrons that do 

not interact in HCal we use the muon detector as discussed below.   

9  

 
  
  

4.2.1. The Extended Algorithm   

The extended analysis starts by requiring  as before, reconstructed and well fitted  tracks from the tracker with energy 

deposited in ECal, HCal and Mudet within a ( , ) angular road   around their path. The angular width is optimized for 

each sub-detector [3] [4] .  For tracks below 10 GeV a (1/p) dependent bin width has been chosen. 

We reconstruct the track with the vXB and dE/dx effects for each particle using the Runge-Kutta improved stepper. 

We require no more than 2 hits per cell and that the particle reaches a given depth (12 layers) in the muon detector.      

Figure 7: Hadronic shower in a jet projected on the detector transverse (x, y) plane (cm) 

                       

We  exploit  the  fact  that  the  hadronic  showers  deposit  most  of  their  energy  in  the  innermost  layers  of  the  hadron 

calorimeter.  This  is  illustrated  in  Figure  7  where  among  the  red  track  are  pions  of  32  and  37  GeV  which  interact  in 

HCal so that there are no dE/dx deposits in the last layers of  HCal as indicated by the white arrow in Fig. 7.  Projected 

tracks that do not leave a signal in the last 5 layers of HCal are rejected as muons. However, we also require not more 

than 4 hits/layer to reject charged particles that result from interactions of nearby neutral hadrons (neutrons and K0 s). 

Therefore,  the  muons  that  reach  the  end  of  HCal  must  leave  some  hits  in  the  5  last  layers.   In  this  scan  along  the 

projected  track  we  reject  muon  candidates  where  there  are  no  hits  (i.e.  no  dE/dx  losses  recorded)  in  2-3  consecutive 

layers  of  the  HCal  or  the  muon  detector.  An  interacting  hadron  displays  a  set  of  hits  that  typically  ends  in  a  splash 

followed by no hits.  These extra requirements do not lead to any losses of genuine muons, but they reduce the number 

of  hadrons  that  would  be  identified  as  muons  without  such  requirements.  In  the  muon  detector  we  request  that  the 

minimum of hits/layer is smaller or equal 2, since interacting hadrons might have three and more hits in each layer of 

Mudet, and the maximum of hits per layer to be below 7, this allow not to cut muons which have neutral particles in 

their vicinity which come from neighbor hadrons.

4.2.2. Performance of Muon ID  

The  effect  of  the  cuts  is  shown  in  Table  4.  The  detection  efficiency  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  total  number  of 

muons detected by the total number of reconstructed muons projected from the tracker where they have passed a  good 

fit  criteria.   The  detection  efficiency  defined  this  way  under-estimates  true  efficiency  because,  due  to  multiple 

scattering, tracks can leave the fiducial volume of the barrel detectors and pass into the forward detector regions where 

muon tracking identification has not yet been developed.  There are also cases for which the track is not detected out to 
the  12th  layer  because  it  reached  the  end  of  its  range  before  the  required  12th  layer.  This  is  true  for  many  medium 

energy shallow tracks.   It should also be noted that 12 pions and 3 K s that decay to muons are properly identified by 

our algorithm as muons in the muon detector.

Table 4: Muon Identification in 10000 b-bbar  with at least 12 layers/12 Hits in the Muon 

The  overall  muon  detection  efficiency  obtained  without  discounting  for  the  effects  described  above  is  ~94%.  This 

covers the entire momentum range. The efficiency is ~100% at, and above, 10 GeV. For muon momentum at 3GeV/c 

the detection efficiency of 0.06% with the helical swimmer becomes 33% with our basic stepper algorithm, and is  66% 

with  the  Runge-Kutta  corrected  stepper.  The  total  number  of  muons  reconstructed  increases  from  657  before  the 

Runge-Kutta  correction  to  670  muons  after,  mostly  in  the  medium  and  lower  energy  range.  At  the  same  time  the 

number of pions misidentified  as  muons moves from 323 (figure 6) to  59  (table 4). When  a Kalman  filter is used  to 

account for multiple scattering and other random processes we find a better separation of muons from hadrons.                                 

5.  THE KALMAN FILTER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STEPPER 

We  expect  that  further  improvement  of  the  muon  identification  efficiency  can  be  accomplished  if  the  predicted 

trajectory of the muon can account for actual occurrences of stochastic processes, like multiple scattering. At the same 

11   

  

time we expect that background rejection capabilities can be improved if the decay kinks can be detected, although this 

may not be possible. 

Both of these goals can be achieved, in as much as it is possible, by the application of a Kalman filter technique. Its 

main  advantage  over  the  other  methods  of  track  extrapolation  stems  from  its  ability  to  use  actual  measurements  to 

adjust local track parameters and to offer a better prediction for the track trajectory.  

5.1.The Principle 

The Kalman Filter is a method used to construct processes for which the information at each step can be fully derived 

from the information at the preceding step and where a covariant matrix of error is available at each step. The Kalman 

Filter  is  composed  of  two  components.   The  propagation  component,  using  the  propagation  matrix,  propagates  the  

information and the error information at each step.   The filtering component combines the information received at the 

end of the step to the information from data measurements.       

Figure 8: Stepping in the Passive Material (1, 2, 3,4, ) and recording in the Active Material step 5 

The Kalman Filter operates by using a  state vector  that describes the processes  history. For the present case, a phase 

space point {x, y ,z, px, py, pz},  is used as the state vector, The state vector change includes the effects of dE/dx and of 

the magnetic field in a step by step procedure.  It is calculated using the transport matrix, steps 1, 2, 3, 4 shown in 

Figure 8, in the passive material.  The same analytical form is used in the stepper, but is now translated into a transport 

matrix, with the Runge-Kutta term included. The state vector at location k-1 is propagated using the propagation matrix, 

together with the covariant matrix, represented by the cone, which provides the information on random processes,. 

Following the propagation step, the state vector is updated using Kalman filtering. The filtering combines the 

information derived from the propagation with the measurement made at the new point to produce an optimal state 

vector. It takes place when the hit is recorded in the active material (step 5) as shown in Figure 8.  The procedure 

defines, for each radius, a ( ,  ) dynamic path in which the hits left by the particle in the active material of the sub-

detectors are the data collected.  The number of steps was optimized for the stepper at 10 steps per layer by considering 
12  

 
  
 
  
 
 

with half the number of steps.

both the reconstruction efficiency and running time for all the subdetectors.  Accounting for the fact that we get 

combined information on the phase-space point and the covariant matrix at each point, we have obtained good results

The  state  vector  at  location  k-1,  is  propagated  using  the  propagation  matrix,  to  location  k.  The  choice  of  the  state 

vector  as  the  phase  space  point  allows  the  use  the  stepper  Algorithm  translated  into  the  propagation  matrix.  In  the 

notation adopted the (-) indicates the extrapolation and the (+) the Kalman weighting.     

5.3.The Results 

The results for single muons at 4GeV before and after the application of the Kalman Filter are shown in Figure 9.   

The figure below shows

 

(track-hit) between the extrapolated track using the stepper and the hit at different depths 

(different layer) in the Muon Detector.             

Figure9: 

( track- hit)  at  4  GeV  Before  and  After  applying  Kalman 

Filter

In the LHS of the figure the width of the distribution is driven by the resolution at 4 GeV and the hit collection path 

covers ~ 3bins in 

. The RHS of the figure shows that one can restrict the hit collection to one bin in 

.

The filter helps 

to  master  random  effects  such  as  multiple-scattering  when  particles  lose  sufficient  momentum  and  enter  the  domain 

where  these  effects  are  dominant.  As  a  result,  the  filter  allows  a  better  separation  between  muons  and  neighboring 

hadrons in jets since the effect of multiple-scattering and the kinks are corrected each layer at a time and this in turn 

corrects for the distances between the reconstructed track and the hits. 

6.  CONCLUSIONS 

A  new  method  to  reconstruct  and  identify  muons  with  high  efficiency  and  achieve  high  pion  rejection  in  the  ILC 

muon detector for the SiD concept has been presented. Jets physics plays an important role at the ILC,. In this paper    

the method has been tested on single muons and applied on bbar-b jets produced at 500 GeV .  In bbar-b jets,  70% of 

the muons are at and above 3 GeV/c and  reach the muon detector,  more than 30% of them have a momentum between 

3 and 7.5 GeV/c. These medium energy muons tend to lose a large proportion of their energy by dE/dx such that by the 

time they reach the muon detector they are 1 to 2 GeV particles. In order to identify muons in the medium energy range, 

a  second  order  dE/dx  corrections  as  well  as  the  Kalman  filter  stepper  were  implemented  in  the  code.  The  improved 

analysis includes now multiple scattering as well a  magnetic field effects integrated using the Runge-Kutta method and 

the loss of energy through ionization, dE/dx. In the Kalman filter the error at the starting point has been chosen to be the 

angle  bin  size  in  the  calorimeter  ECal.  Prior  to  the  entry  into  ECal  the  particles  trajectory  are  reconstructed  by  the 

stepper before improvements. The Kalman filter gives a realistic propagation at each step and allows hits to be collected 

in a narrower kinematic band. As a result of applying the Kalman Filter, the cuts around the track path may be restricted 

14  

  

to a minimum number of   angle bins, even for low momenta,. One therefore achieve a better separation of the muons 

from their neighbors in jets . The drop in the number of fake muons in the sample allows a better ID efficiency and an 

increased purity . This was previously possible only at higher momenta. This new capability is particularly important to 

allow for an effective separation of particles in jets.

Abstract.  The  reflection  and  transmission  of  a  few-cycle  femtosecond  Ti:Sa  laser  pulse 
impinging  on  a  thin  plasma  layer  have  been  analysed  on  the  basis  of  classical 
electrodynamics.  The  plasma  electrons  were  represented  by  a  surface  current  density  along 
the  layer.  This  target  plasma  can  be  imagined  as  generated  from  a  thin  foil  by  a  pre-pulse 
which  is  then  followed  by  the  main  high-intensity  laser  pulse.  An  approximate  analytic 
solution has been given for the system of the coupled Maxwell-Lorentz equations describing 
the dynamics of the surface current and the composite radiation field. With the help of these 
solutions  the  Fourier  components  of  the  reflected  radiation  have  been  calculated.  The 
nonlinearities  stemming  from  the  relativistic  kinematics  of  the  free  electrons  lead  to  the 
appearance  of  higher-order  harmonics  in  the  scattered  spectra.  In  our  analysis  particular 
attention  has  been  paid  to  the  role  of  the  carrier-envelope  phase  difference  of  the  incoming 
few-cycle laser pulse. For instance, we show that the fourth harmonic peak strongly depends 
on  the  carrier-envelope  phase  difference  with  a  modulation  being  almost  25  percent.  In 
general, the harmonic peaks are down-shifted due to the presence of the intensity-dependent 
factors of order of 15-65 percent in case of an incoming field of intensity 2×1019W/cm2. This 
phenomenon is analogous to the famous intensity-dependent frequency shift appearing in the 
high-intensity Thomson scattering on a single electron. The analysis has shown that at grazing 
incidence the first even harmonics dominate rather than the odd ones, as for medium angles of 
incidence.  It  has  also  been  shown  that  the  spectrum  of  the  high-harmonics  has  a  long  tail 
where  the  heights  of  the  peaks  vary  practically  within  one  order  of  magnitude  forming  a 
quasi-continuum.  By  Fourier  synthesising  the  components  from  this  plateau    region  of  the 
higher-harmonic spectrum, attosecond pulses have been obtained.

1. Introduction 

The study of the interaction of intense few-cycle laser pulses with matter has brought a 
new,  important  branch  of  investigations  in  nonlinear  optics,  as  Brabec  and  Krausz  [1] 
emphasized in their review paper. The effect of the absolute phase (the carrier-envelope phase 
difference,  in  short:  CE  phase)  on  the  nonlinear  response  of  atoms  and  of  solids  interacting 
with a very short, few-cycle strong laser pulse has recently drawn considerable attention and  
initiated a wide-spreading theoretical and experimental research. For instance Paulus et al. [2] 
have  detected  an  anticorrelation  in  the  shot-to-shot  analysis  of  the  photoelectron  yield  of 
ionization measured by two opposing detectors. This effect comes from the random variation 
of the CE phase (hence the direction and the magnitude of the electric field of the laser) from 
one  pulse  to  the  other.  Such  extreme  short  pulses  can  be  used  to  monitor  for  instance  the 
details  of  photoelectron  dynamics  [3]  or  atomic  inner-shell  relaxation  processes,  like  the

Auger  effect  [4].  Concerning  theory,  the  CE  pase-dependence  of  the  spatial  asymmetry  in 
photoionization has been extensively investigated by Chelkowski et al. [5], and by Milosevic 
et al. [6-7]. In the meantime the problem of the stabilization of the CE phase in the few-cycle 
laser  pulse  trains  has  been  achieved  [8-9].  On  the  basis  of  a  simulation,  using  the  time-
dependent density functional approach, Lemell et al. [10] predicted the CE phase-dependence 
of  the  photoelectron  yield  in  case  of  the  surface  photoelectric  effect  of  metals  in  the  tunnel 
regime. Apolonskiy et al. [11] and Dombi et. al. [12] have reported the measurement of this 
effect, but the absolut phase-dependence had a considerably smaller modulation (CE phase-
sensitivity)  in  their  experiment,  than  predicted  by  the  simulation.  Fortier  et  al.  has  recently 
demonstrated  the  CE  phase  effect  in  quantum  interference  of  injected  photocurrents  in 
semiconductors  [13].  In  the  multiphoton  regime  Nakajima  and  Watanabe  [14]  has  found 
theoretically CE phase effects  in  the bound  state population of a Cs atom excited by nearly 
single-cycle pulses.  

At  this  point  we  would  like  to  note  that  there  is  a  wide-spread  opinion  among 
researchers  investigating  the  CE  phase  effect  that  this  effect  shows  up  exclusively  in 
nonlinear processes. In fact, as Fearn and Lamb [15] have shown already in 1991, the sine or 
the  cosine  character  of  the  laser  pulse  make  a  difference  in  the  linear  photoionization 
dynamics if one takes into account the counter-rotating term in the interaction. As they wrote 
in  Section  IV.  of  their  paper:  “This  suggests  that…the  time  delay  [of  the  electron  signal] 
could be used to measure the phase of the field.” A simple illustration of the linear CE phase 
effect has recently been considered by Ristow [16] in the case of a harmonic oscillator. 

We  have  seen  above,  that  in  the  theoretical  works  exclusively  nonlinear  quantum 
processes  (photoionization,  surface  photoelectric  effect)  have  been  considered  in  the  non-
relativistic regime in the context of CE phase effects. In the present paper we briefly describe 
our theoretical analysis on the reflection and transmission of a few-cycle laser pulse on a thin 
plasma  layer  represented  by  a  surface  current.  Our  analysis  here,  as  in  our  earlier  non-
relativistic study [17] on CE phase effects in high-harmonic generation on a thin metal layer, 
is  based  completely  on  classical  electrodynamics  and  mechanics,  in  the  frame  of  which  we 
solve  the  system  of  coupled  Maxwell-Lorentz  equations  of  the  incoming  and  scattered 
radiation and the classical surface current. The idea to study such a system appeared to us by 
reading  a  paper  by  Sommerfeld  [18]  published  in  Annalen  der  Physik  in  1915,  in  which  he 
analysed  the  temporal  distortion  of  x-ray  pulses  of  arbitrary  shape  and  duration  impinging 
perpendicularly on a surface current being in vacuum. In Ref. [17] we have generalized this 
model  in  the  following  sense.  On  one  hand,  we  allowed  oblique  incidence  of  the  incoming 
radiation field, and on the other hand, we assume that the surface current (which represents a 
thin metal layer) is embedded between two semi-infinite dielectrics with two different indeces 
of refraction. In the present paper we shall give the relativistic generalization of the equation 
of  motion  of  the  surface  current,  which  was  not  investigated  by  Sommerfeld.  This  latter 
approach  is  needed  to  consider  the  interaction  of  a  plasma  layer  with  a  laser  pulse  of 
relativistic intensities. In our analysis we shall use the simplifying assumption that the plasma 
layer surrouded by vacuum, hence the angle of incidence coincides the angle of reflection and 
of transmission. Moreover, the thickness of the layer will be assumed to be smaller than the 
wavelingth of the incoming radiation. This assumptuon restricts the applicability of our results 
to moderate relativistic intensities (for which the intensity parameter is not larger than unity), 
because  for  higher  intensities  the  displacements  of  the  plasma  electrons  along  the  cross-
section of the layer can be larger than the wavelength of the incoming radiation.  

The  high-harmonic  production  on  metallic  free  electrons  has  been  considered 
analytically by Lichters et al. [19] on the basis of their famous oscillating mirror model. Our 
model  considerably  differs  from  this  approach,  because  we  have  exactly  taken  into  account 
the  radiation  reaction  on  the  electron  plasma.  We  note  that  recently  there  has  been  much

labour put into the classical simulations of various processes (generation on coherent x-rays, 
laser  acceleration  of  electrons)  in  laser-plasma  interaction  [20-22].  Moreover,  this  year  the 
first experimental results appeared on the generation of quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches 
by strong laser fields [23]. On the other hand, to our knowledge, there have been no classical 
relativistic  considerations  so  far  published,  where  the  CE  phase  effect  in  the  relativistic 
regime would have been analysed. The recent paper may be considered as a contribution to 
the study of this particular aspect, too. 

In  Section  2  we  present  the  basic  equations  describing  our  model.  In  Section  3  an 
approximate  analytic  solution  will  be  given  for  the  system  of  the  coupled  Maxwell-Lorentz 
equations describing the dynamics of the surface current (representing the plasma electrons) 
and the composite radiation field. With the help of these solutions the Fourier components of 
the  reflected  and  transmitted  radiation  will  be  calculated.  The  nonlinearities  stemming  from 
the  relativistic  kinematics  lead  to  the  appearance  of  higher-order  harmonics  in  the  scattered 
spectra. In general, the harmonic peaks are down-shifted due to the presence of the intensity-
dependent  factors  of  order  of  15-65  per  cent  in  case  of  an  incoming  field  of  intensity 
2×1019W/cm2.  This  phenomenon  is  analogous  to  the  famous  intensity-dependent  frequency 
shift appearing in the high-intensity Thomson scattering on a single electron. In our analysis 
particular  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  role  of  the  carrier-envelope  phase  difference  of  the 
incoming few-cycle laser pulse. For instance the 4th harmonic peak strongly depends on the 
carrier-envelope phase difference with a modulation being almost 25 per cent. It is also shown 
that  the  scattered  spectrum  has  a  long  tail,  where  the  heights  of  the  peaks  vary  practically 
within  one  order  of  magnitude  in  the  frequency  range  considered.  We  will  show  that  by 
Fourier  synthesising  the  components  from  this  plateau    region  of  the  higher-harmonic 
spectrum, attosecond pulses can be obtained.

The  model  to  be  used  here  has  already  been  studied  in  our  earlier  work  [17].  For 
completeness  of  the  present  paper,  let  us  briefly  summarize  first  the  basic  notations  and 
equations, which can also be found in Ref. [17] for the general case, when the electron layer is 
embedded between two dielectrics. Later we will specialize our study to case of an electron 
(plasma) layer being in vacuum. We take the coordinate system such that the first dielectric 
with index of refraction  1n  fills the region 
, this  is called region 1. In region 2 we

  perpendicular  to  the  z-axis  and  defined  by  the

bound to region 2 and moving freely in the x-y plane. In case of perpendicular incidence the 
light would come from the positive z-direction, and it would be transmitted in the negative z-
direction into region 3. The plane of incidence is defined as the y-z plane and the initial  kr -
vector is assumed to make an angle  1θ  with the z-axis. In case of an s-polarized incoming TE 
wave  the  components  of  the  electric  field  and  the  magnetic  induction  read

nJ .  Within  these  approximations  the  integrals  in  Eq.  (35)  can  be  calculated  by  using  the 
formulae 3.322.1-2 of Gradshteyn and Ryzhik [24]. 
We  have  checked  that  for  relatively  long  pulses,  say,  for  a  10-cycle  pulse,  at  a

found that the spectrum has a very sharp cut-off determined by the critical index depending 
2/2β  in the argument of the Bessel function. We can borrow a formula for

where 
0ω   is  the  carrier  frequency  of  the  laser 
pulse.  On  the  figure  it  is  clearly  shown  that  the 
harmonic  peaks  are  down-shifted  due  to  the 
intensity-dependent  factor  discussed  in  the  text 
before.  
 
On  Fig.  1  we  see  a  typical  spectrum  of  the  reflected  signal  at  grazing  incidence,  where  the 
even harmonics dominate. This is understandable from Eqs. (35) and (36) where the angular 
prefactors  θcos
  and  θsin   multiply  the  odd  and  the  even  contributions,  respectively.  In  the 
next  example  we  illustrate  on  Fig.  2  that  the  maximum  value  of  the  4th  harmonic  peak 
strongly  depends  on  the  carrier-envelope  phase  difference  ϕ,  the  modulation  (which  is 
)  is  of  almost  25%.  We  mention  that  we  have 
defined  as 
checked this modulation  M  for the other harmonic peaks, but, interestingly, we found it very 
). Similarily for the integrated spectrum the value of  M  is also very small, 
small (
a couple of per cents.

Fig. 4  Shows the attosecond pulse train obtained 
by  Fourier  synthetising  the  contribution  of  the 
electric  field  components  coming  from 
the 
plateau  region  shown  on  Fig.  3.  We  have 
summed up these contributions from 
8=ν  up to 
20=ν
. The temporal width of these pulses is of 
order  of  ~250  attoseconds.  The  peak  intensities 
of  this  pulses  are  about  1/1000  of  the  original

pulse.  On  the  figure  it  is  clearly  shown  that  the 
harmonic  peaks  down-shifted  due 
the 
intensity-dependent  factor  discussed  in  the  text 
before. It is also seen that the spectrum has a long 
tail  where 
the  peaks  vary 
practically  within  one  order  of  magnitude  in  the 
frequency range considered. 
 
 
The presence of the “plateau” shown on Fig. 3 suggests that by Fourier synthesis of this part 
of  the  spectrum  results  in  the  appearance  of  attosecond  pulses.  Note  that  the  spacing  of  the 
individual  peaks  in  the  plateau  region  is  much  smaller  than  the  central  frequency,  thus  this 
plateau is almost a quasi-continuum.The result of the Fourier syntheses is shown on  Fig. 4, 
where we see a part of an attosecond pulse train in the reflected signal. 
By  closing  the  present  letter,  we  can  conclude  from  our  analysis,  that,  on  one  hand, 
 
certain parts of the scattered spectrum of a few-cycle laser pulse impinging on a plasma layer 
is CE phase-sensitive, and, on the other hand, the Fourier components in the plateau region 
are  in  phase,  and  coherently  add  up  to  yield  high-intensity  attosecond  UV  pulse  trains. 
Moreover, we have have given an analytic expression for the critical index characterising the 
cut-off  region  of  the  harmonic  spectra,  and    we  have  proven  that  in  general  there  is  an 
intensity-dependent  frequency  down  shift  of  the  harmonic  components  generated  on  the 
plasma layer, analogous to that had been found earlier for nonlinear Thomson scattering on a 
single electron.

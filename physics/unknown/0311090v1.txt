Abstract 

times1, 

 
High-energy bremsstrahlung and K X-rays were used to produce nearly background-free 
K X-ray spectra of up to 87 keV (Pb) via X-ray fluorescence.  The fluorescing radiation 
was  produced  by  electron  accelerators,  consisting  of  heated  and  cooled  cylindrical 
LiTaO3  and  LiNbO3  crystals  at  mTorr  pressures.    The  newly  discovered  process  of  gas 
amplification  whereby  the  ambient  gas  pressure  is  optimized  to  maximize  the  electron 
energy  was  used  to  produce  energetic  electrons  which  when  incident  on  a  W/Bi  target 
gave rise to a radiation field consisting of high-energy bremsstrahlung as well as W and 
Bi K X-rays.  These photons were used to fluoresce Ta and Pb K X-rays.

capable of ionizing K electrons in high-Z 
materials  and  producing  K  x-rays.    Nor 
is  there  a  suggestion  that  these  crystals 
can produce focused ion beams.18  Much

used  to  produce  radiographs19.      For

that 

nearly 

fairly  clear  radiogram  is  obtained.  With 
some  development  it  should be possible 
to fluoresce U and Pu K x-rays for anti-
terrorism purposes.  Growth processes in 
plants  and  tree  leaves  can  be  studied  by 
using  them  as  targets  and  analyzing  the 
electron excited x-rays of elements in the 
leaves.21   
     The  main  object  of  this  paper  is  to 
show 
background-free 
bremsstrahlung  fluoresced  K  x-rays  of 
elements  up  to  Pb  (Z  =  82)  can  be 
produced  by 
  pyroelectric  crystal 
electron  accelerators  if  the  process  of 
”gas  amplification",  which  has  been 
described recently in ref 12 for electrons 
is  taken  advantage  of.    A  secondary 
object  is  to  show  that  gas  amplification 
occurs on cooling but not on heating for 
a  given  crystal  by  means  of  the  x-ray 
spectra.    The  idea  is  that  optimizing the 
ambient  gas  pressure  can  more  than 
double  the  maximum  electron  energy.  
When  the  -z  base  of  a  pyroelectric 
crystal  is  exposed  to  dilute  gas  during 
cooling, gas molecules in the vicinity of 
the  crystal  are  ionized14  and  plasma  is 
formed  near 
the  negatively  charged 
surface.  The  resulting  positive  ions  are 
attracted  to  the  crystal  surface  thus 
reducing  its  negative  charge  as  well  as 
the  electron  energy  while;  the  electrons 
are 
and 
accelerated  away  from  the  crystal.17,18,20 
The  maximum  energy  of  electrons 
produced  during  cooling  can  be  varied 
by a factor of more than two by varying 
the  gas  pressure  surrounding  the  crystal 
between  0.1  mTorr  and  about  10 
mTorr.12    On  heating  a  crystal  when  its 
surface  is  positive  the  gas  amplification 
effect 
is 
inoperative  and 
demonstrated  via  the  observed  x-ray 
spectra.   
      When  the  +z  base  of  a  crystal  is 
exposed  to  dilute  gas  during  cooling 

focused  by 

the  plasma 

this 

is 

for 

the 

positive ions are focused and accelerated 
away from the crystal while electrons are 
accelerated to and impinge on the crystal 
producing  x  rays  and  bremsstrahlung  at 
the  surface  of  the  crystall2.  We  used 
these  crystal  x-rays  and  bremsstrahlung 
to  produce  relatively  background-free 
fluoresced K x-rays of lower Z elements  
     Except 
commercially 
produced  pyroelectric  crystal  x-ray 
generator by Amptek19 whose maximum 
bremsstrahlung  energy  is  about  35  keV, 
no  studies  of  the  behavior  of  these 
crystals 
the 
in  dilute  gases, 
production of high-Z K x ray production, 
have previously been reported.  
     An  experimental  arrangement  which 
produces the highest energy radiation, is 
shown schematically in Fig. 1 where a 4 
mm dia x 10 mm LiNbO3 crystal with its 
–z  base  exposed  produces  a  focused 
electron  beam18,20  which  impinges  on  a 
composite  target  of  W/Bi.    This  gives 
rise  to  high-energy  bremsstrahlung  and 
W/Bi  K  x-rays,  which  were  used  to 
fluoresce K X-rays of Ta and Pb.

cycles was used and the x-ray detector was only 
activated  when  the  incident  electron  energy 
exceeded the Ta K edge, 67.4 keV. (b) Shows Ta

because  the  cross  section  for  K-shell

in  the  inset.  The  logarithmic  Pt/Sn  spectrum  in

very  prominent  too  but  the  peak-to-

FIG.  4.    X-ray  spectrum  of  bremsstrahlung 
fluoresced  Pb  combined  with  Bi  K  x-rays  from 
the target.  The geometry was that of Fig. 1  The 
10  mm  LiNbO3  crystal  provided  higher  energy 
electrons  than  the  5  mm  LiTaO3  crystal.    This 
spectrum shows that the electron energy was 
 > 90.5 keV, the Bi K-shell ionization energy.  
 
 
ratio  for  this  spectrum  is  more  than  a 
factor of two better than the Ta K X-ray 
spectrum obtained with 5.6 MeV gamma 
rays  at  the  Duke  Free  Electron  Laser 
(FEL).26  
     Bremsstrahlung  fluoresced  Sn  K  x-

attenuated 
Bremsstrahlung  spectrum  arising  from 
electron bombardment of Pt is shown in 
a  linear  display  in  Fig.  3(a).    The 
geometry is collinear as shown above in 
the  inset.  The  log  display  of  the  Pt/Sn 
spectrum in Fig. 3(b) is multiplied by an 
arbitrary  number  for  display  purposes. 
The  electron-excited  Pt  L  x-rays,  which 
are  attenuated  by  the  Sn  are  prominent.  
The  crystal  was  LiNbO3    (5mm  long) 
with its -z base exposed and the Nb K x-
ray  spectrum,  which  was  produced 
during  heating  to  160oC,  is  shown  as 
asymmetry  of  gas

the 

same  pressure, 

removed  during  heating  for  this  run  to 
permit observation of Nb L x-rays.  The 
Pt/Sn 
target  removal  had  minimum 
effect on the end point energy.  We have 
observed  gas  amplification  only  on 
cooling when the –z base is exposed, the 
bremsstrahlung  end  point  energy  in  this 
case is about 65 keV while in the heating 
the 
mode,  at 
bremsstrahlung  end  point  energy 
is 
about  33  keV.  While  the  end  point 
energy  will  change  with  pressure  on 
cooling,  during  heating  the  end  point 
energy  is  virtually  unchanged.    This 
suggests  that  there  is  no plasma energy-
enhancing  process  occurring  when  the 
crystal  surface  is  positive,  while  when 
the  crystal  surface  is  negative  a  plasma 
energy-enhancing  effect  occurs.    When 
the  crystal’s  surface  is  negative  and  the 
crystal  is  cooling  i.e.,  the  –z  base  is 
exposed, the plasma at the surface of the 
crystal  may  be  displaced  in  several 
ways. A gradual or sudden change in the 
gas  pressure  causes  the  plasma  to  be 
is 
expelled 
illustrated in reference 12, Figs. 2 and 3, 
reference  14  in  Figs.  6,  7  and  9  and 
reference  20.  The  plasma  may  also  be 
separated  from  the  crystal  by  a  sudden 
violent  movement  of  the  crystal  from  a 
stationary  position  or  by  increasing  the 
angular  velocity  when  the  crystal  is 
rotating in dilute gas.  
     Figure 4 shows the x-ray spectrum of 
bremsstrahlung  fluoresced  Pb  combined 
with  leak-through  Bi  K  x-rays  from  the 
W/Bi  target.    The  count  rate  was  very 
low  here  so  two  thermal  cycles  were 
required  and  the  detector  could  view  a 
little  bit  of  the  target,  the  source  of  the 
Bi.  Nevertheless  this  proves  that  the 
electron  energy  was  >  90.5  keV,  the  Bi 
K-shell ionization energy. 
     In  conclusion  we  show  how  heated

crystals  such  as  LiNbO3  and  LiTaO3 
under the right conditions can be used to 
produce 
background-free 
characteristic K x-ray spectra for high-Z 
elements.    We  compare  these  spectra 
with  electron-excited  spectra,  where  the 
background is much larger, and we show 
how the gas amplification process can be 
observed  via  x-rays  when  the  crystal 
surface  is  negative  whereas  no electron-

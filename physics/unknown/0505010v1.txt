Following the spirit of de Broglie and Einstein, we think the concepts of matter and 
radiation should be unified. This paper contains two parts. In part 1, we examine the 
physical  nature  of  matter  wave.  We  propose  a  model  based  on  the  following 
postulates:  (1)  Like  the  photon,  a  particle  is  not  a  point-like  object;  instead,  it 
behaves like a wave packet. (2) Like the photon, the matter wave of a particle is an 
excitation  of  a  real  physical  field.  (3)  Different  types  of  particles  are  different 
excitation  modes  of  a  unified  field  in  the  vacuum.  We  will  demonstrate  that  this 
model  can  provide  a  simpler  explanation  to  many  physical  observations  than  the 
current  theories.  In  part  2,  we  examine  the  origin  of  mass  and  the  mass-energy 
relation. If matters are composed of waves, where does their mass come from? We 
suggest that this problem can be solved by treating the rest mass on the same footing 
as energy and momentum. Here, we use a system containing a single free particle to 
demonstrate our approach. We hypothesize that, since the vacuum field behaves like 
an  EM field  in  the  long range  (>1 fm), the wave equation of a free particle in the 
asymptotic region is similar to the Maxwell equation, which can be solved using the 
technique  of  separation  of  variables.  Using  the  correspondence  principle,  our 
solution  suggests  that  the  rest  mass  of  a  particle  is  associated  with  a  “transverse 
wave number”, which characterizes the radial variation of the wave function in the 
transverse plane. Results of this work have several important implications. First, we 
found that the relativistic relationship between energy, momentum and mass can be 
derived from the dispersion relation of the wavefunction of a free particle. The so-
called  “Einstein’s  relation”  of  mass  and  energy  can  also  be  obtained  from  the 
particle’s  wave  properties.  Second,  the  wave  equation  describing  the  longitudinal 
component  of  the  wavefunction  is  identical in form to the Klein-Gordon  equation. 
This  work  suggests  that  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  can  have  a  common 
theoretical origin in wave mechanics.

INTRODUCTION 
 

The universe is composed of matter and radiation, which were thought to have very 
different properties throughout much of human history. Starting from the beginning of the twentieth 
century, however, there was a dramatic shift of perception. Some physicists became aware that 
matter and radiation cannot be regarded as two entirely different objects. This changes of thinking 
was mainly due to the landmark discoveries of: (1) Max Planck, who found that the energy of 

radiation is quantized, (2) Albert Einstein, who proposed the concept of photon based on the photo-
electric effect, and (3) Louis de Broglie, who further proposed that matter also has a wave property 
such that the wavevector is connected with momentum. These discoveries enabled Bohr to propose 
the atomic model of hydrogen and inspired Schrödinger to develop the wave mechanics to describe 
quantum behaviors of the electron. 

 
With the successful development of quantum mechanics, people became fully aware of the 
wave-corpuscle duality of a particle and began to treat matter and radiation in a unified view. For 
example, in his highly popular textbook of quantum mechanics, A. Messiah explicitly stated: “the 
possibility exists of establishing a unified theory in which matter and radiation are different 
varieties of the same type of object, having wave-like and corpusclar character. These suppositions, 
which have guided de Broglie in his theory of matter waves, were found to be entirely justified”.[1]  

 
Yet, according to quantum physics taught today, there are significant differences between 

matter and radiation. First, radiation, or the motion of photons, is described by the Maxwell’s 
equations. The motion of electron, on the other hand, is described by the Schrödinger equation in 
the non-relativistic situation, or by the Dirac’s equation in the relativistic case. Second, while the 
photon is known to be a wave of the EM field, the wave of a particle described by the quantum 
mechanics is not regarded as a physical wave; it is thought to be associated with only the 
probability of finding a particle in a particular location and time. Third, particles that make up 
matter usually have rest mass, while the radiation does not. Forth, in the quantum field theory of 
today (i.e., the Standard Model of elementary particle), the particle is regarded as a point-like object 
[2]. The matter is supposed to be made up of fermions that have spin ½, while radiation is carried by 
bosons that have spin 1 [3].  

 
We think some of these differences might be superficial. If one probes into a deeper layer of 

the foundation of quantum mechanics, one may be able to find a common root that can truly unify 
the theories of matter and radiation. This paper is an attempt to find such a root. 

 

Part 1: What is the physical meaning of matter wave? 

 
Unlike the time at the beginning of the 20th century, the current particle theory (i.e., the 

Standard Model) takes an extremely corpuscular view on both matter and radiation [4]. Not only it 
regards the particles as point-like objects, it also regards the interacting forces between matters 
(fermions) as exchange of particles (bosons) [5].  The Standard Model is essentially a perturbation 
theory. It does not attempt to describe the wave properties of a particle like the Maxwell equation 
or the Schrödinger equation. The wave nature of the particle is already lost in this model. We 
believe that in order to fully explore the implications of the wave-corpuscle duality of the particle, 
one should use a classical field approach so that one can have the hope to find the internal structure 
of a wavepacket. In addition, we believe that all corpuscular properties of a particle should have 
their counter-properties in the wave representation. For example, the momentum (a corpuscular 
property) of a particle is connected to its wave vector (a wave property) by the de Broglie relation 
[6], and the energy of a particle is connected to its wave frequency by the Planck's relation [7]. We 
believe that similar connections should also be found for the rest mass and spin. (For details, see 
Part 2 of this paper). 

 
In this work, we would like to explore an alternative approach that may provide a better 

explanation of the properties of matter based on the wave-corpuscle duality. Our approach is based 
on three conceptual postulates: 

 

2

 

 

(1)  Like the photon, a particle (such as a electron) is not a point-like object, instead, it 

behaves like a wave packet.  

(2)  Like the photon, the matter wave of a particle is an excitation of a real physical field.  

(3)  Different types of particles are different excitation modes of a unified field in the 

vacuum. 

In the following, we will discuss the justification of these postulates and examine their implications. 
 
1.1.  Is the elementary particle a point-like object or a wave packet? 

At present, the particle is treated as a point-like object in the Standard Model of particle 

physics. This view clearly cannot be correct for at least one particle, the photon. From the Maxwell 
theory, we know the photon is an oscillation of the EM field. The size of the photon cannot be 
arbitrarily small as one may expect from a point-like object. In a travelling photon, the length of its 
wavepacket would at least span through several wavelengths. The width of a photon also has a 
limited size. In fact, it is well known in the field of optics that one cannot resolve two adjacent 
photons beyond a certain minimum distance, which according to the formula of Rayleight is about 
one third of the wavelength (approximately 1.5 x10-4 cm for visible light) [8]. Thus, it is impossible 
to localize a photon to a region smaller than one third of its wavelength! In other words, the photon 
is clearly not a point-like object. 

 
Could the electron be a point-like object? A large amount of experimental evidence had 

indicated that the electron also has wave properties [9] .  For example, a single electron can be 
diffracted by a crystal following the Bragg’s law.  And undoubtedly, the wave nature of the electron 
is clearly demonstrated in the operation of an electron microscope. Because of their wave 
properties, one cannot resolve two adjacent electrons beyond a certain minimum distance, which is 
proportional to the wavelength of the electrons. This is the main reason why an electron microscope 
must be operated at a higher voltage in order to have a higher resolution power. Thus, we believe 
that our first postulate, i.e., like the photon, a particle is not a point-like object, instead, it behaves 
like a wave packet, is well justified. 

 
Our postulate #1 is not totally new in quantum physics. One could say that it had already 

been recognized by many physicists. For example, in his famous Lectures on Physics, Richard 
Feynman had stated: “…electrons behave just like light. The quantum behavior of atomic objects 
(electrons, protons, neutrons photons and so on) is the same for all, they are all ‘particle 
waves,’…so what we learn about the properties of electrons… will apply also to all ‘particles,’ 
including photons of light”. [10] 

 

1.2.  Is the matter wave a real physical wave (or just an indication of probability)? 
 

In our proposed model, the concept of matter wave is different from that in the existing 

quantum theory. Today, the standard view of quantum mechanics is that the wavefunction does not 
represent a physical wave, instead, it only has statistical meaning. That is, the magnitude of the 
wavefunction only gives the probability of finding the presence of a particle at a specific location 
and time. This view is generally referred to as the “Copenhagen interpretation,” which represents the 
orthodox school of thought today [11]. Such an interpretation, however, was based more on 
philosophical choice than on physical evidence. While the statistical interpretation of the 

3

Copenhagen school had been strongly supported by major contributors of the quantum theory, 
including Bohr and Heisenberg, it was not universally agreed. In fact, many well-known physicists 
at that time, including Einstein, Schrödinger, and de Broglie, had opposed such an interpretation [11]. 

 
What is the physical structure of a particle (such as a electron) according the Copenhagen 

school? It was never clearly defined. What we know is that, with the introduction of second 
quantization in the development of quantum electrodynamics, the wavefunction was later 
interpreted to be associated with the creation and annihilation operators [12]. Conceptually, particles 
like electrons or positrons had become point-like objects in the modern physics theories.  

 
Then, there is a dichotomy in quantum mechanics today: On the one hand, people realize 

that all particles have wave properties that behave like photons of light. On the other hand, the 
current theories of quantum physics regard elementary particles (e.g., electrons) as point-like 
objects, which clearly do not behave like photons! 

 
We think the only way to escape this dilemma is to assume that, like the photon, the matter 
wave is a real physical wave. This would truly unify the concepts of matter and radiation. This new 
interpretation of matter wave can also explain many experimental findings that are difficult to 
explain using the statistical interpretation of the Copenhagen school. For example, it is known that a 
single electron can pass through two near-by slits to give an interference pattern. How can a point-
like electron do that? If the electron is really a point-like object, it can only pass one of the slits and 
thus could never form an interference pattern with itself passing through the other slit. Similar 
argument can also be made on the diffraction of electron from a crystal. If the electron is a point-
like object, it can only bounce from one atom in the crystal, and thus should not form an 
interference pattern following the Bragg’s law. So far, there has been no satisfactory argument that 
can logically explain how a “probability wave” of a point-like object can give the interference 
pattern associated with either a double-slit or a crystal lattice [13]. 

 
Besides, how can one explain the principle of a transmitting electron microscope by treating 

the electron as a “probability wave” of a point-like object? Furthermore, if the electron is a point-
like object, the atom will be vastly empty. How can an atom behave like a hard sphere, the diameter 
of which is about 100,000 times of the nucleus? How can the point-like electrons hold atoms 
together to form a molecule? Can a “wave of probability” form chemical bonds between atoms and 
hold them together? 

 
Thus, we would like to propose the second postulate for this model: Like the photon, the 

matter wave of a particle is an excitation of a real physical field. This postulate follows the same 
spirit of de Broglie and Einstein in their concept of matter wave. This postulate implies that we 
should be able to find a proper wave equation, the solution of which would not only give the 
probability of finding the presence of a particle, it could actually describe the oscillation of a 
physical field. Our only requirement is that, when an excitation is created or absorbed, it must 
involve the entire quantum of energy (i.e., a partial absorption is not possible). 
 
1.3.  Could different particles represent different excitation modes of the same field? 

According to the classical field concept, a force is associated with a field. In later years, 

however, the field idea was replaced by particles in the development of the Standard Model. 
According to this model, a force is simply the exchange of particles. For example, the electric field 
around the proton in the hydrogen atom is considered to be a continuous emission and absorption of 

 

4

photons [5]. Similarly, the gravitational filed is replaced by the exchange of gravitons. Such a picture 
is philosophically troublesome. Besides, some of the hypothetical “field” particles, like the graviton 
(spin 2) or the Higg’s boson (spin 0), have never been proven in existence. For the purpose of this 
model, we will stay with the classical field concept. That is, we will regard a force to be associated 
with a field. 

 
How many fields are there in the universe? At present, there are only four known physical 

fields, i.e., electro-magnetic (EM), weak interaction, strong interaction and gravitational. According 
to the Standard Model, the first three fields may not be regarded as truly independent and could be 
unified in extremely short distance (or high energy) [14]. Among these four different fields, only the 
EM field appears to have sufficient long range and strength to support the wave of a free particle. 
The gravitational field is extremely weak, while both the strong and weak forces are applicable only 
in very short range (10-13 cm and 10-16 cm, respectively). Since the wave packet representing a free 
particle (such as an electron) must be larger than the inter-atomic distance of a crystal (10-8 cm), if 
the matter wave is a real physical wave, it must either be associated with the oscillation of the EM 
field, or with a unified field that behaves like the EM field in long distance. 

 
Like the Standard Model, we also think that the EM, weak and strong interactions can be 

unified into a single field. If this conjecture is true, different particles could simply represent 
different excitation modes of this unified field. This argument is not unreasonable. First, at least one 
type of particle (photon) is already known to be the excitation of the EM field. Second, since 
electrons and positrons can be converted to photons (by annihilation) and vice versa (by pair 
creation), their mutual convertibility may suggest that electrons and positrons are also excitations of 
a physical field related to the EM field. Third, a similar argument can also be made on muons and 
their anti-particles, since they can decay to become other leptons and photons. Hence, it is not 
unreasonable to propose that different solutions of the wave equation of a single physical field 
(which behaves like the EM field in the long range) could represent different types of particles. 

 
In essence, we are extending the concept of photon to matter waves of all particles. That is, 

similar to the fact that a photon is an excitation of the EM field, leptons such as electron or 
positrons are also excitations of a physical field that behaves like the EM field in the long range. In 
fact, we may further generalize that, all known particles, including fermions and bosons with 
different rest masses, are corresponding to different excitation modes of a single physical field.  

 
In this picture, the universe would become much simpler than what are being proposed by 

the particle physicists today. For example, in our model, particle and anti-particle are simply 
complementary excitation modes. This can do away with the conceptual difficulty of the Dirac’s 
theory, which assumed that there is an infinite “sea” of “negative energy electrons” in the vacuum 
[15]. When one of these electrons in the negative energy state becomes unoccupied, it creates a hole, 
which behaves like an anti-particle of the electron (i.e., the positron). As far as we know, there is no 
physical evidence supporting the idea that the vacuum is filled with a sea of negative energy 
electrons. 

 
Since the Standard Model today is an extension of Dirac’s theory, it would require that, for 
the existence of any given type of anti-particle, there must be a “sea” of the corresponding particles 
occupying all negative energy states. Thus, the vacuum is not only full of negative energy electrons, 
it is also filled with infinite numbers of negative energy muons, neutrinos, quarks, etc. The vacuum 
must be a very crowded place! 

 

 

5

In comparison, the conceptual picture of our model is far simpler. Since we regard all 

particles (including particles and anti-particles of different mass) as different excitation modes of 
the same field, there is no need to assume the existence of an infinite number of particles occupying 
the negative energy states. Our model can also easily explain the different life times of particles. 
Since some of the excitations may be stable; they would behave like solitons and have relatively 
long life. As other excitations may not be stable; they would be the particles with short life and may 
only be observed as “resonance”. Finally, since different particles are just different excitation 
modes, conversion of particles between different types can be easily explained. 
 
1.4.  Is there an ether-like medium in the vacuum? 

If particles are indeed excitations of a unified field, we wonder if this field is associated with 

a medium in the space. As we know, many types of excitations are associated with vibrations in a 
medium. Examples of such excitations include sound waves in a solid or ‘phonons’ in a superfluid. 
This reminds us of the concept of “ether”, which had a prominent role in the 19th century physics. 
Indeed, in the original work of Maxwell, his theory of electromagnetism was developed by 
regarding the EM field as a stress of a medium in the space [16]. The role of ether in physical 
theories was well summarized by Sir Edmund Whittaker in the Preface of his book: A History of 
the theories of Aether and Electricity [17]: “As everyone knows, the aether played a great part in the 
physics of the nineteenth century; but in the first decade of the twentieth, chiefly as a result of the 
failure of attempts to observe the earth’s motion relative to the aether, and the acceptance of the 
principle that such attempt must always fail, the word ‘aether’ fell out of favour, and it became 
customary to refer to the interplanetary spaces as “vacuous”; the vacuum being conceived as mere 
emptiness, having no properties except that of propagating electromagnetic waves. But with the 
development of quantum electrodynamics, the vacuum has come to be regarded as the seat of the 
‘zero-point’ oscillations of the electromagnetic field, of the ‘zero-point’ fluctuations of electric 
charge and current, and of a ‘polarisation’ corresponding to a dielectric constant different from 
unity. It seems absurd to retain the name ‘vacuum’ for an entity so rich in physical properties, and 
the historical word ‘aether’ may fitly be retained”.  

 
So, no matter what the name is called, the space between visible matters is not a mere 

emptiness. This is true for both the 19th century physics and the 20th century physics. Then, the 
original idea of Maxwell who associated the EM field with the stress of ‘ether’ could be a good one. 
One cannot dismiss this idea simply because, at one point of history, the concept of ether was out of 
favor.  

 
In fact, since we believe that the EM, strong and weak interactions can all be unified into 

one field, we can extend the idea of Maxwell on EM radiation (i.e., photons) to all particles. That is, 
we can assume that the unified field is associated with the stress of a ether-like medium in the space 
and different particles are just different excitation modes of the ether. 

 
Such an extension of the concept of ether in fact can remove the difficulty encountered by 
physicists at the end of the 19th century. As pointed out by Whittaker, the disfavoring of the ether 
idea was mainly because of the failure of attempts to observe the earth’s motion relative to the 
ether. The most famous one of such attempts was the Michelson-Morley experiment conducted in 
1887 [18]. But, this type of experiment did not necessarily disprove the existence of ether. It only 
failed to detect any movement of the ether relative to the observation instrument. Now, if our model 
is correct, that is, the matter waves of all particles, including those composing the experimental 
instruments and the planet earth, are excitation waves of the ether, the instrument should move 

 

6

within the ether without resistance, just like an excitation wave moves along its medium. As a 
result, one cannot detect any movement of the ether relative to the observation instrument. This 
situation is somewhat like an electron moving within a superconductor; the electron cannot sense its 
own motion relative to the superconductor itself. 

  
Thus, the failure of attempts to observe the earth’s motion relative to the ether cannot be 

regarded as evidence against the existence of ether according to our new model. 

 
This new ether model has certain conceptual advantages. For example, our postulate that 

different particles are just different excitation modes of the ether can offer a very simple 
explanation to events observed in high-energy particle physics. It is well known that a large variety 
of particles can be produced from the vacuum in an electron-positron (or proton-antiproton) 
collision. Our model can easily explain this observation. If particles are excitations, any energetic 
action causing a strong disturbance in the ether would naturally create a large number of excitation 
waves, which would propagate outward and appear as flying-off particles. 
 
1.5.  Could both quantum mechanics and “relativity” be owing to the wave nature of matter?  

 

Someone may ask whether this new ether hypothesis would cause a conflict with the special 

theory of relativity (STR) [19]. Since the first postulate of STR is that all inertial frames are 
equivalent for the observation and formulation of physical laws, if there is an ether-like medium, 
the universe must have a resting frame (i.e., the resting frame of the ether). At this point, there is no 
clear evidence that whether our universe does have a resting frame or not. Most of the experimental 
tests for STR did not address this question specifically. Instead, the acceptance of STR by the 
physics community at present is mainly due to people’s believe (with good experimental evidence) 
that the so-called “relativistic” relations between energy, momentum and mass are correct. But, it 
can be shown that these same relations can be derived independently from the wave properties of a 
particle, without the first postulate of STR [20]. In fact, the classical theory of STR, as originally 
formulated by Einstein, is known to have many problems [21]. As a more logical approach, we 
believe that it is the wave nature of a particle that gives rise to the “relativistic” effects. (We will 
have a more detailed discussion of this point in Part 2 of this work).

 could no longer be a real number and 

In fact, it is not difficult to see that our approach is conceptually simpler and can provide a 
deeper foundation than the classical STR. Besides the two postulates given by Einstein, STR also 
had an important hidden assumption, that is, no particle can travel faster than the speed of light. If 
(
an object can travel faster than light, the factor 
1
−=
the relativistic formulas would break down. Since the classical relativity theory regards matter as a 
composition of corpuscular objects, there was no physical reason to justify why an object cannot 
travel faster than light. In contrast, in our new model, the statement that no particle can travel faster 
than the speed of light can be easily justified. Since we assume that the matter waves of all particles 
are similar to light that propagate along the ether-like medium, their limiting traveling speed is 
determined by the properties of the propagating medium (i.e., the ether). If the EM radiation is 
traveling at the limiting speed allowed by the ether for wave-propagation, none of the other 
excitation waves of the ether can exceed that speed! Thus, the hidden assumption of the STR, that 
all particles cannot travel faster than the speed of light, can be simply explained by the idea that 
particles are waves propagating in an elastic medium!  
 

 

7

In the following part of this paper, we will give more detailed treatments on the derivation 

of the quantum mechanics formulas and the relativistic formulas using the ether approach. Our goal 
is to show that this proposed framework can explain both the quantum and “relativistic” effects 
based on the wave nature of a particle.  
 
 
Part 2: The origin of mass and the mass-energy relation 
 

If matters are composed of waves, where does their mass come from? In the followings, we 

will address two specific questions:  
 
a. What is the origin of the rest mass when a particle is viewed as a wavepacket?  
 

If matter really has a dual character (i.e., with both wave and corpuscular properties), then, 

should each corpuscular property of a particle (such as energy, momentum and mass) have an 
equivalent wave property? For example, it is known that the momentum (a corpuscular property) is 
connected to the wave vector (a wave property) by the de Broglie relation [6], and the energy of a 
particle is connected to its wave frequency by the Planck’s relation [7]. Since mass (or the rest mass) 
is clearly a corpuscular property, should it also be connected to a wave property? In other word, if a 
particle is an excitation wave, what is the wave property that gives the particle a “mass”? 

 
We believe that mass should be treated on the same footing as momentum and energy. Since 
both momentum and energy are connected with wave vectors (in the space and time dimensions), it 
is reasonable to speculate that the rest mass may be connected with some sort of “intrinsic wave 
vector” too. The first goal of this part of the work is to explore such a possibility.  

b. What is the relationship between mass, energy and momentum from the point of view that 

 

regards the particle as a wave?  

 
Previously, certain relations between m, E and p had been proposed from the special theory 

of relativity (STR) [19], which considered a particle exclusively from the corpuscular view. We 
would like to investigate if similar relations can be derived from the wave properties of a particle. 
 
2.1.  Essence of our model 
 

To answer the above questions, we will use a very simple model (i.e., a system containing a 
single free particle) to demonstrate our conceptual approach. In the conventional field theories, it is 
customary to put the mass (m) as a parameter in the Lagrangian [22]. Using such a formulism, one 
essentially has to associate each particle (with a given m) with a separated field. This is troublesome 
in principle because it would require too many fields in the universe. (The number of elementary 
particles known today is still quite large). In order to greatly simplify the situation, we proposed 
that different particles could be different excitation modes of a single field. (This is our third 
postulate). In such case, the parameter m should not appear in the wave equation. Instead, it should 
appear only in the solutions of the wave equation, in which m can assume different values.  
 

In fact, if one accepts the idea that mass should be treated on the same footing as momentum 

and energy, then m should be an eigenvalue of the proper wave equation, just like E in the time-
dependent Schrödinger equation [23]. It is obvious that one cannot derive the proper wave equation 
from a Lagrangian that contains m as an explicit parameter. It also means that none of the equations 

 

8

containing m as an explicit parameter (including the Klein-Gordon equation, the Schrödinger 
equation and the Dirac equation) can be regarded as the basic wave equation.  
 

In the Standard Model of particle physics used today, the masses of some particles are also 

not given explicitly in the Lagrangian; they emerge from the equation by imposing a breaking of 
local symmetry [7]. The Standard Model, however, regards the particle as a point-like object [8], 
which is incompatible with our postulates. Thus, we cannot use its approach either.  

 
How can we find the basic wave equation describing a particle in the vacuum (such that m 
can emerge from its solution)? We believe that one can only use the classical field theory to solve 
this problem. At present, we do not have sufficient knowledge about the detailed properties of the 
vacuum to allow us to write down an exact wave equation for it. Thus, we can only aim at finding a 
reasonable approximation that may describe the basic wave properties of a free particle. Our 
approach was outlined in an earlier paper [20]. Here we will summarize the highlights of this model 
and discuss the major implications of its results. 

 
Our first task is to find a wave equation that could describe the asymptotic wave behavior of 

a free particle in the vacuum. According to the second postulate of our model, we believe that the 
matter wave of a particle is an excitation of a real physical field in the vacuum. As discussed in 
Section 1.3, we think that this vacuum field is similar to the EM field in long range. This is because 
among the four known fields, only the EM field has sufficiently long rang and strength to support 
the matter wave. For example, from the diffraction experiment, we know the size of the wave 
packet representing a free electron must be larger than the inter-atomic distance (10-8 cm) in a 
crystal. Then, if the electron wave is a real physical wave, it can only be associated with a vacuum 
field that behaves like the EM field at a long distance. 

 
Indeed, we know that at least one particle, the photon, is a wave associated with the 
oscillation of the EM field. Thus, we can take advantage of the knowledge that, in the range longer 
than 10-13 cm, the vacuum would behave mainly like an EM field. To find the wave equation of a 
vacuum, we may start by considering the EM field first. From the Maxwell’s equations, one can 
derive [25]

these two terms become less important because there is no particle-particle interaction.

Furthermore, since these forces have very short range (≤10-13 cm), they can be ignored if we are 
interested in solving the wave equation only in the asymptotic region (at distance > 10-13 cm).  
 

In this one-particle system, ρ and j will represent the self-charge and the self-current 

associated with the particle. For a particle with no electrical charge, such as a photon, ρ and j of 
course are equal to zero. For a charged particle, such as an electron, ρ and j are very complicated. 
So far there is still no satisfactory theory in calculating them. But, it is known that the charge of the 
particle is highly localized in a small core [26]. It was estimated that the charge of an electron is 
confined within a region having a very short radius (ro), which is in the order of 10-13 cm [26]. The 
wave of an electron, on the other hand, is supposed to occupy a much larger area (> 10-8 cm); 
otherwise, it would not be possible to generate a diffraction pattern from a crystal. Then, we can 
simplify Eqs.(2.2) by considering only the asymptotic region (i.e., r > ro ), where ρ and j can be 
assumed to be practically zero. Under this condition, we have 
 
 
 
The simplest solution of Eq. (2-3) is to let all components of this 4-vector to vary with space and 
time in the same manner. That is, if one can find a function ψ, which satisfies

then the 4-vector  Aµ = (φoψ, Aoψ)  will automatically satisfy Eq. (2.3). Here, the coefficients Ao and 
φo are subject only to the Lorentz gauge condition [27]. We will regard Eq. (2-4) as the asymptotic 
wave equation of a free particle in the vacuum. Here, we have not specified the functional form of 
ψ. In the simplest case, ψ can be regarded as a scalar. In other cases, ψ can be a matrix (such as a 
spinor). The proper form of ψ could be dependent on the spin of the particle. In the following, for 
reason of simplificity, we will treat ψ as a scalar. 
 
2.2.  Solutions of the proposed wave equation 
 

The form of our proposed asymptotic wave equation of a free particle, Eq.(2.4), is similar to 

the wave equation of the EM radiation.  Its simplest solution is known to be a plane wave

known wave function of a photon. This plane wave solution, however, does not properly describe 
the properties of a particle with nonzero rest mass, which behaves like a mass point in the classical 
limit. Since such a particle must have a limited “size”, the probability of detecting the particle (i.e. 
ψ ) in the transverse plane should not be uniform. That is, the probability of finding the particle is

(Here  h  is Planck’s constant divided by 2π). This means that based on the solution of our 
wavefunction, we can obtain the Planck's relation and the de Broglie relation directly. This is highly 
encouraging.  From Eqs. (2.13) and (2.14), it is clear that the wave parameters ω, k are associated 
with the energy and momentum of the free particle, respectively. But what is the physical meaning 
 in the classical limit? From Eq. (2.11), we can see that  l  is closely related to ω and k.  By

This suggests that the wave parameter  l  is associated with the rest mass of the particle. Since the 
rest mass is known to be a relativistic scalar, in order to associate m with  l , one must show that the 
 obtained here should behave like a scalar under a Lorentz transformation. Indeed, we found that

Finally, what is the physical meaning of the parameter n? It appears that n is likely to be 

associated with the helicity of the free particle. First, n is a quantum number conjugate to the 
angular coordinate θ. Dimensional analysis thus suggests that n is associated with some sort of 
angular momentum. Secondly, the helicity operator can be regarded as equivalent to an angular 
momentum operator about an axis of the particle's trajectory (in direction 
the wave equation, the eigenvalue of this operator is 
of the added phase factor n

clockwise, while the wave function with +i n θ represents a left-handed helix moving counter-
clockwise.

What are the physical implications of connecting the rest mass of a free particle with the 
parameter  l  in the wave function? Let us first examine what happens to a particle with zero rest

constant, and the wave function 
kˆψ  given in Eq. (2.12) now becomes a plane wave. Thus, our 
model predicts that the EM wave of a photon in the vacuum is essentially a plane wave, which 
agrees well with the known results of the electromagnetic theory. Furthermore, when  l  = 0,  
Eq. (2.11) becomes

This predicts that a photon (or any free particle with zero rest mass) must always travel in the 
speed of light.  
 

What happens when the rest mass is not zero? The wave function given in Eq. (2.12) not 

only oscillates in the longitudinal direction, it also oscillates in the radial direction in the transverse 
plane. The “wavelength” of this radial oscillation is equal to 2π/
since the asymptotic form of the Bessel function for a large argument is  

. This point can be seen easily,

Thus,  l can be regarded as the "transverse wave number" of the free particle. From Eq. (2.20), we

Thus, a particle with a larger m will have a smaller effective radius in the corresponding wave 
function. In other words, the matter wave representing a particle with heavier mass would be more 
“particle-like”, (i.e., the probability of finding the particle is more localized). This may explain why 
an electron behaves more like a “particle” than a neutrino or a photon. 
 
2.5.  The so-called “relativistic mass-energy relations” can be derived from the wave 

properties of a particle  

A very important implication of our result is that, once we can identify

l

with m, the so-called “relativistic mass-energy relations” will emerge naturally from the wave 
properties of the particle. This can be demonstrated in a straightforward way. By substituting Eq.

(2.30)  

These results demonstrate that the well known relativistic relations can be derived using an 

approach of wave mechanics. STR is known to be a classical theory, which does not consider 
quantum effects. And thus, STR and quantum mechanics (or wave mechanics) are traditionally 
regarded as two totally independent physical theories [33]. In this work, we show that, if we regard a 
particle as an excitation of the vacuum field, the relativistic relations between energy, momentum 
and mass can be derived naturally from the dispersion relation of the wave function representing a 
free particle. This result suggests that the so-called relativistic effects of a particle can actually be 
originated from its wave properties.  
 
 
2.6.  The quantum mechanical wavefunction can be connected to the oscillation of a physical 

field 

 

After demonstrating that  l is connected with m, it becomes possible to relate our wave 

function with those derived in the quantum mechanics. For example, using Eq. (2.20), we can see 
that Eq. (2.7) now becomes

This implies that the wave function in the Klein-Gordon equation (φ ) is equivalent to the 
longitudinal component of the travelling wave representing a free particle ( ψ ) in our model. This 
result supports our starting assumption that the matter wave of a particle is an excitation of a real 
physical field. That is, the wave function should not only represent the probability of finding the 
particle (as proposed by the Copenhagen interpretation), it should be connected to the oscillation of 
a certain component of the physical field. In this model, we demonstrate that, under the asymptotic 
approximation, φ in the Klein-Gordon equation is connected to the longitudinal component of the 
oscillation of A
µ (the 4-vector potential of the EM field). Since it is known that, in the non-
relativistic limit, the Klein-Gordon equation can lead to the Schrödinger equation [23], the 
wavefunction of the Schrödinger equation thus can also be related to a component of the physical 
field using our approach. 
 

L

Furthermore, the fact that our model can naturally lead to the Klein-Gordon equation may 

indicate that our proposal of using Eq.(2.4) as the wave equation to describe the wave properties of 
a free particle (in the asymptotic region) was a reasonable one.

CONCLUSION 
 
 
demonstrate an approach to find the connection between the rest mass of a particle and its wave 
property. We hypothesize that a particle is an excitation of the vacuum field, which behaves like an 
EM field in long range (>10-13 cm). Based on such an assumption, we proposed that the wave 
equation of a free particle in the asymptotic region can be approximated using the Maxwell 
equation. Furthermore, we argued that the wavefunction of a free particle should contain a 
longitudinal and a transverse component. Using the technique of separation of variables, we showed 
that the transverse wavefunction is described by the Bessel function of the first kind and the 
longitudinal wavefunction is a travelling wave. We found four parameters in the resulting 
wavefunction, ω, k,  l  and n, which were shown to be connected with the energy, momentum, rest 
mass and helicity of the free particle, respectively. 
 
 
parameter  l (the transverse wave vector) with m, we found that the relationship between energy, 
momentum and mass (which was originally attributed to the STR) can be derived from the 
dispersion relation of the wavefunction of a free particle. The so-called “Einstein’s relation” of 
energy and mass can also be obtained from the particle’s wave properties. This means that there is 
an alternative way to derive the so-called “relativistic” relations; then, the experimental verification 
of these relations does not necessarily imply whether STR is correct or not. Second, we found that 
the wave equation describing the longitudinal component of the wavefunction is identical in form to 
the Klein-Gordon equation. This suggests that the wavefunction in quantum mechanics may 
represent a certain component of oscillation in the vacuum field. This result supports our postulate 
#2. Finally, the fact that this simple model can derive both the relativistic relations and the Klein-
Gordon equation suggests that STR and quantum mechanics may not be totally independent as they 
were thought before. We think they could actually have a common theoretical origin in wave 
mechanics.

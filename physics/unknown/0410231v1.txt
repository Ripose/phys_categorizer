Simulations  of  dusty  plasmas  were  performed  using  GRAPE-6,  a  special-purpose  computer 
designed for gravitational N-body problems. The collective behaviour of dust particles, which are 
injected into the plasma, was studied by means of three-dimensional computer simulations. As an 
example of a dusty plasma simulation, we have calculated movement of dust particles in plasmas 
under microgravity conditions. In this simulation, a dust-free region called the “void” is observed 
in the dust cloud. Another example was to simulate experiments on Coulomb crystals in plasmas. 
Formation  of  a  Coulomb  crystal  was  observed  under  typical  laboratory  conditions.  For  the 
simulation  of  a  dusty  plasma  in  microgravity  with  3x104  particles,  GRAPE-6  can  perform  the 
whole operation 1000 times faster than by using a Pentium4-1.6GHz CPU. 

 

 

1. Introduction 

limiting 

pipeline 

In order to achieve high calculation speeds, and to 
lower the cost of the hardware used for simulations, 
special-purpose  computers  have  been  developed 
recently.  A  special-purpose  computer  is  typically  a 
massively  parallel  processing  computer,  which  has 
many  custom  LSI  chips  specifically  designed  to 
calculate  a  few  expressions.  By 
the 
versatility  of 
the  hardware 
the  calculation, 
complexity  can  be  reduced  drastically.  Therefore,  a 
special-purpose  computer  can  contain  a  greater 
number  of  processors  on  one  chip  compare  to  a 
general-purpose  computer.  GRAPE-6  (G6)  is  a 
special-purpose  computer  for  gravitational  N-body 
simulations [1] manufactured by Hamamatsu Metrix 
the 
Co.,  Ltd.  The  G6  can  rapidly  calculate 
its 
gravitational  force  between  particles  using 
specialized 
peak 
performance  of  a  G6  unit  reaches  985  Gflops.  We 
have  used  G6  for  the  calculation  of  Coulomb 
interactions, which is the same form of central force 
as  the  gravitational  force,  to  accelerate  the  plasma 
simulation.  We  have  previously  developed  three-
dimensional  electrostatic  simulations  using  G6,  and 
performed 
plasma  waves, 
fluctuations,  and  diffusions.  Currently,  we  are 
investigating  developing  simulations  of  dusty 
plasma using G6. In addition to the plasma, a dusty 
plasma  contains  micro-particles,  i.e.  dust  particles. 
Since  micrometer 
size  particles  are  usually 
negatively charged - 103~104e - in a plasma (here e 
is the elementary charge), the dusty plasma is easily 
“strongly  coupled”.  If  specific  conditions  are 
fulfilled, 
form  an  ordered 
crystalline  structure  called  “Coulomb  crystal”  or 
“plasma  crystal”  [2,3].  Many  interesting  features  of 
dusty  plasmas  have  been  elucidated  in  laboratory 

the  dust  particles 

processors.  The 

simulations 

of 

experiments,  and  various  shapes  of  the  Coulomb 
crystal have been observed, such as the disk, dome, 
and  cone  [4].  However,  in  laboratory  experiments, 
the  movement  of  dust  particles  and  the  structure  of 
the Coulomb crystal are restricted due to gravity. In 
order  to  study  dusty  plasmas  by  suppressing  the 
effect  of  gravity,  experiments  under  microgravity 
conditions were carried out [5]. In this experiment, a 
dust-free  region  called  the  “void”  [6]  was  observed 
in the center of the dust cloud. It was also observed 
that a part of the dust particles around the void were 
in a crystalline state. In this paper, we present some 
simulations  of  a  dusty  plasma  to  simulate  these 
experiments,  to  examine  the  basic  concept  of 
computing using G6, and the actual performance of 
G6. 
 
2. Calculations using GRAPE-6 

A  unit  of  G6  has  32  custom  LSI  chips,  each 
containing  6  pipeline  processors  for  the  calculation 
of gravitational interactions between particles. Since 
one  pipeline  processor  works 
logically  as  8 
pipelines,  G6  has  1536  pipelines  per  unit.  G6

calculations  using 

these 
realizes  high-speed 
pipelines efficiently in parallel. G6 is connected to a 
general-purpose  host  computer 
(a  Pentium  4 
personal  computer) 
through  a  communication 
interface.  G6  calculates  only  the  force  due  to 
gravitation between particles, and the host computer 
performs  the  other  calculations.  The  user  program 
runs on the host computer, and it can use G6 only by 
calling  library  functions.  The  architecture  of  G6  is 
fairly  simple  from  the  viewpoint  of  a  user.  G6  is 
comprised  of  multiple  memory  units  and  pipeline 
processors. Each LSI chip has its own memory unit, 
and whole particle data is stored distributed to these 
memory  units.  Thus,  the  calculation  of  the  force, 
which is exerted on a particle, is divided among all 
LSI  chips.  Besides,  G6  calculates  the  forces  on 
in  parallel  using  pipeline 
different  particles 
processors on the LSI chip. The architecture of G6 is 
shown in Fig.1.

particles.  This  inter-particle  force  is  calculated  as 
Coulomb force using expression (3).

3.1. Behaviour of dust clouds in microgravity 

As an example of dusty plasma simulations using 
G6,  we  have  calculated  movement  of  dust  particles 
which are injected into a plasma under microgravity 
conditions.  In  this  simulation,  we  have  assumed

capacitively coupled radio-frequency (RF) discharge 
as  the  background  plasma,  and  micron-order  radius 
spheres as the dust particles. Considering the size of 
the dust particles and the plasma conditions, we use 
three external forces as the dominant external forces 
acting  on  the  dust  particles:  ion  drag  force,  neutral 
gas drag force, and electrostatic confining force [7]. 
The magnitudes of these external forces and others, 
which may play a role under similar conditions, have 
been investigated on an experimental basis [8]. The 
interaction between dust particles is calculated using 
the  Coulomb  interaction  shown  in  expression  (3). 
The  background  plasma  affects  the  space  charge 
quasi-neutral  condition,  the  number  of  charges  on 
the  dust  particle,  and  magnitude  of  the  external 
forces. In this example, we use an argon plasma with 
a  neutral  gas  pressure  of  0.1  torr  and  a  plasma 
density  of  1015  ~  1016  m-3.  The  electron  and  ion 
temperature was 1 eV and 0.05 eV, respectively. As 
an  initial  condition,  dust  particles  were  uniformly 
distributed within the system using random numbers, 
and 
the 
Maxwellian velocity distribution with a temperature 
of 300 K. Figure 2 shows the temporal evolution of 
the spatial distribution of the dust particles. It is seen 
that  dust  particles  are  pushed  out  of  the  central 

the  velocity  distribution  was  set 

to 

region,  and  are  arranged  at  the  outer  edge  of  the 
system.  This  results 
the  appearance  of  a 
in 
centimeter-size void inside the dust cloud. It is also 
observed  that  the  dust  number-density  is  enhanced 
around the void, and the dust particles form a rather 
stable  structure.  This  “void  formation”  has  been 
observed in some laboratory as well as microgravity 
experiments [5,9]. In microgravity, sufficiently large 
dust  particles  can  exist  within  the  main  plasma, 
different  from  laboratory  experiments,  and  void 
formation  occurs  easily  in  dusty  plasmas.  The  void 
characteristics  obtained  in  the  simulations,  such  as 
the  void  diameter,  are  similar  to  those  seen  in  the 
microgravity experiments. 

In  the  present  simulation,  we  have  also  studied 
variations  in  the  void  diameter  caused  by  varying 
external conditions. Figure 3 illustrates the variation 
of  the  void  diameter  as  a  function  of  the  plasma 
density.  It  is  seen  that  the  void  diameter  increases 
with  plasma  density.  However,  in  the  region  where 
the plasma density is very low, no void formation is 
observed 
is 
the  simulation.  This 
analogous  with  that  seen  in  some  experimental 
results  [10],  where  the  void  size  is  observed  to 
increase with input RF power.

In 

in  plasmas. 

The  next  example  is  to  simulate  experiments  of 
this 
Coulomb  crystallization 
simulation,  we  have  studied  crystallization  of  the 
dust  clouds,  due  to  Coulomb  interactions  between 
dust particles. These inter-particle forces are directly 
calculated  using  G6  with  expression  (3).  We  have 
used  a  capacitively  coupled  RF  plasma  for  the 
background  plasma,  and  a  micron-order-radius 
sphere  for  the  dust  particles.  It  is  assumed  that  the 
dust  particles  are  levitating  in  the  plasma-sheath 
boundary  above 
the  electrode.  The  external 
conditions,  such  as  plasma  parameters  and  gas 
pressure,  are  set  to  typical  values  of  the  usual 
laboratory  experiments.  The  effects  of  gravity, 
neutral gas drag, and electric field are considered as 
external  forces  exerted  on  the  dust  particles.  In  the 
vertical  direction,  a  strong  electric  field,  i.e.  the 
sheath electric field, is introduced to support the dust 
particles  against  gravity.  Besides,  there  is  a  weak 
confining  electric  field  in  a  lateral  direction  to 
confine  the  dust  particles.  In  this  example,  we  used 
an  argon  plasma  with  a  neutral  gas  pressure  of  0.1 
torr  and  a  plasma  density  of  1015  m-3.  The  electron 
and  ion  temperatures  were  3  eV  and  0.05  eV, 
respectively.  As  an  initial  condition,  dust  particles 
were  uniformly  distributed  within  the  system  using 
random numbers, and the velocity distribution is set 
the  Maxwellian  velocity  distribution  for  a

by  the  neutral  gas  and  form  an  ordered  crystalline 
structure.  This  transition  from  a  fluid  liquid-like 
phase  to  a  stationary  solid-like  phase,  is  referred  to 
as  “Coulomb  crystallization”.  An  example  of  the 
observed  crystalline  structure  is  shown  in  Fig.4.

Fig.4 (a), it can be seen that the dust cloud is divided 
into  several  layers  in  the  z-axial  direction,  and  the 
dust  particles  are  confined  within  each 
layer. 
Although  some  disorder  is  found  in  the  central 
region, a nearly isotropic ordered structure is seen in 
Fig.4  (b).  In  some  laboratory  experiments,  the 
structure  of  the  Coulomb  crystal  has  been  reported 
as containing several layers arranged vertically, with 
the  dust  particles  within  the  layers  showing  a 
uniformly-spaced  isotropic  arrangement  in  a  lateral 
direction [3]. Unlike the laboratory experiments, the 
lateral  arrangement  of  dust  particles  within  the 
the 
layers  was  not  completely 
simulation.  However, 
is 
analogous with that of the Coulomb crystal observed 
in the laboratory experiments.

Finally, in order to evaluate the actual calculation 
speed  of  G6  for  the  simulations,  we  compare  the 
calculation  speed  of  G6  and  a  personal  computer. 
Figure  5  shows  the  computing  time  required  to 
perform  the  whole  operation  of  a  simulation  using 
G6,  and 
the  host  computer 
(incorporating  a  Pentium  4-1.6  GHz  CPU).  The 
simulation of a dusty plasma in microgravity, which 
is presented above, is used for the comparison. It is 
shown  that  it  takes  12.1  hours  to  perform  the 
simulation with 3×104 particles using the Pentium 4 
personal  computer,  and  43  seconds  using  G6.  This 
advantage  becomes  obvious 
the  case  of 
simulations  containing  more  than  104  particles.  It 
was  also  shown  that  the  whole  calculation  of  the 
simulation can be performed at an average speed of 
800  Gflops  by  using  the  special-  purpose  computer 
G6. 
 
4. Conclusions 

in 

We have performed simulations of dusty plasmas 
the 
using  a  special-purpose  computer  system, 
GRAPE-6.  The  collective  behaviour  of  dusty 
plasmas  in  microgravity  was  simulated.  It  was 
observed that a centimeter-size void appeared inside 
the  dust  cloud  under  typical  plasma  conditions  in 
some micro- gravity experiments. The dust particles 
around the void were strongly coupled and formed a 
stable  structure.  The  simulated  void  diameter 
increased  with  plasma  density.  However,  when  the 
plasma density was very low, no void formation was 
observed. This behaviour of the dust cloud is similar 
to  those  shown  by  some  experimental  results.  We 
have  also  simulated  the  Coulomb  crystallization  in 
plasmas.  The  crystalline  structure  of 
the  dust 
particles is observed in the plasma-sheath boundary. 

It was seen that the crystalline structure consisted of 
several  layers  arranged  vertically,  with  a  nearly 
isotropic  lateral  arrangement  of  the  dust  particles

obtained is analogous to that seen in some laboratory 
experiments.  It  was  confirmed  that  the  whole 
calculation  of  the  simulation  can  be  performed  at 
an average speed of 800 Gflops by using the special-
purpose GRAPE-6 computer.

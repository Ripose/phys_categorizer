Abstract

A current approach to the problem of inertia suggests that the origin of the inertial

properties of matter is the interaction between matter and vacuum electromagnetic zero-

point radiation.  Herein, it is shown that zero-point phenomena can be treated as the

origin of inertia only when one chooses to ignore the mass-energy content of matter.  In

the absence of any physical basis for such a choice, it is concluded that zero-point-

induced forces must arise in addition to the intrinsic inertial properties of ordinary matter.

1.  Introduction

Several recent papers have proposed that the origin of the inertial properties of matter

can be explained by expressing the inertial mass m in Newton's second law of motion,

(

(1)

entirely in terms of the vacuum electromagnetic zero-point-field (ZPF).1-5  According to

the ZPF proposal, when a body of ordinary matter is accelerated by an external force, the

quarks and electrons constituting the body scatter a portion of the zero-point radiation

occupying the space through which the body moves.  This scattering of radiation leads to

an electromagnetic drag force on the body, which according to ZPF proponents can be

associated with the inertial resistance of the body.1-5  The ZPF hypothesis seems

2

compelling because it not only provides a local description of the inertial properties of

matter, but also provides an electromagnetic basis for inertial and gravitational forces

alike.  Supporters of the ZPF hypothesis have performed a great deal of work in

attempting to show that the interaction between matter and zero-point radiation gives rise

to observable forces.1-5  Even so, the ZPF hypothesis still seems to suffer from at least a

couple of inherent conceptual difficulties.

Certainly, a real zero-point radiation field must give rise some level of resistance on

accelerating matter.  The question is, however, what fraction of the inertial force on an

accelerating object is actually induced by interaction with the ZPF?  This seems to be

ultimately hinged on how one chooses to view E = mc2, referred to as the “law of inertia

of energy” in earlier times.6  Those who support the ZPF hypothesis interpret the energy

content of ordinary matter as entirely kinetic energy of quarks and electrons induced by

interaction with zero-point radiation.1,4  Of course, the problem with this interpretation is

that it implies that subatomic particles have no intrinsic rest mass-energy content.  The

present analysis employs the more traditional interpretation that E = mc2 is merely a

statement that all forms of energy possess inertial properties.7-12  Since subatomic

particles are known to possess rest mass-energy, such particles ought to exhibit intrinsic

inertial properties in addition to any effects arising due to zero-point radiation.

Another problem is that the ZPF hypothesis ascribes the inertial properties of matter

entirely to the inertial mass m in Newton's second law of motion, 1-5 while ignoring the

underlying participation of space-time.7-12  The behavior of space-time clearly forms the

basis necessary for the existence of ZPF-induced forces.  Since the vacuum

electromagnetic ZPF is Lorentz-invariant, if space-time were incapable of distortion the

3

ZPF would remain undetectable in all systems of reference.  As a result, ZPF-induced

forces would not occur.  Of course, space-time distortion does occur and does give rise to

observable forces, as is suggested by general relativity.13-18  Based on this, the objective

of the present analysis is to demonstrate that resistance forces induced by the ZPF act in

addition to the intrinsic inertial properties of ordinary matter.

In the next Section, a block of matter undergoing uniform acceleration is considered.

It is pointed out that while the ZPF cannot be detected in an inertial system of reference,

this is not so in an accelerating system.  Observers residing on the accelerating block

detect a flux of zero-point radiation passing through the block.  The force density due to

this flux of radiation is derived for the case of a small, particle-sized block.  Upon

expressing the force in terms of space-time distortion within the accelerating system,11 it

becomes straightforward to see that ZPF-induced forces arise due to the behavior of

space-time.

In Section 3, the expression for the force derived in Section 2 is applied to the case in

which a body accelerates uniformly through zero-point radiation.  To derive the total

resistance force acting on the body, the expression for the force is modified to include all

forms of energy possessed by the accelerating body.7-12  Carrying this out leads to an

expression for the resistance force having two terms.  One term arises due to the body’s

interaction with the ZPF, and is identical to the force derived solely on the basis of the

ZPF hypothesis;1-4 the other term arises due to the body’s intrinsic rest mass-energy.  The

form of this expression makes it clear that zero-point phenomena cannot be the origin of

inertia; the intrinsic mass-energy of matter must be taken into account, as well.  Without

good reason for intentionally disregarding the intrinsic energy content of matter, it is

concluded that forces induced by interaction with zero-point radiation arise in addition to

the intrinsic inertial properties of matter.

2.  The Resistance Force on Accelerating Matter due to Zero-Point Radiation

As mentioned in the Introduction, zero-point radiation cannot be detected in an inertial

system of reference.  This is not the case in an accelerating system, however.  Consider a

block of matter, of volume 

0V , undergoing uniform acceleration.  Observers residing in

the comoving reference frame (CMRF) of the block detect a flux of zero-point radiation

entering the block through the front side, which we may call wall A, and passing out the

block through the back side, which we call wall B.  According to these observers, the

radiation within the volume of the block possesses a momentum density of the form

∆ =

,

where 

AS  and 

BS  are the Poynting vectors corresponding to the flux of zero-point

radiation detected at walls A and B, respectively.  Expressing the Poynting vectors in

terms of the energy density of the ZPF at each wall leads to

Acu=S

Bcu=S

(2)

(3a)

(3b)

where  Au  and  Bu  are the energy densities of the ZPF at walls A and B, and n is a unit

vector in the direction of the block's acceleration.  Since the block is accelerating, zero-

point radiation gains energy as it traverses the length of the block, from wall A to wall B.

As a result, radiation detected at wall B appears blue-shifted relative to radiation detected

at wall A.  Taking this into account, the Poynting vector given by Eq. (3b) can be

expressed as

where 

Adτ  and 

Bdτ  are intervals of proper time experienced by comoving observers

situated at walls A and B, respectively.  Using Eqs. (3a) and (4) in Eq. (2), the momentum

density of zero-point radiation within the block becomes

where dt is an interval of coordinate time in the accelerating system.  Equation (6) shows

that the momentum density of zero-point radiation within the block is a direct

manifestation of space-time structure in the accelerating system.10-12  Were space-time

incapable of distortion, the expression within square parentheses guarantees that the zero-

point momentum density would be zero in all systems of reference.

According to observers in Minkowski space-time, when an external force  f  is exerted

on a particle, a resistance force  ZPFf

 arises due to interaction between the particle and

zero-point radiation.  Using Eq. (11), observers in Minkowski space-time can express this

resistance force as

where 

0V  is the volume of the accelerating particle.  Equation (12) gives the resistance

force acting on an accelerating particle due to the scattering of zero-point radiation.

According to Eq. (12), the force on the particle arises not only due to the presence of

zero-point radiation, but also due to the distortion of space-time characterized by

dt dτ.10-12  It is interesting to note that when  dt dτ assumes a constant value, the force

given by Eq. (12) is then zero.  This suggests that space-time is intimately involved in the

generation of ZPF-induced forces.

3. The Total Resistance Force on a Uniformly Accelerating Body

In the preceding Section, it was shown that ZPF-induced forces arise due to the

behavior of space-time.  In this Section, it is shown that zero-point radiation can be the

sole origin of inertia only when the intrinsic energy content of matter is ignored.

According to the ZPF hypothesis, when a material body undergoes acceleration due to

an external force, the quarks and electrons constituting the body scatter a portion of the

zero-point radiation passing through the body.  The energy density of this portion of

radiation is1-5

energy that must also be taken into account is the intrinsic rest mass-energy of the

accelerating body.7-12  Thus, the total energy of the accelerating body must then be

In order to determine an expression for the total resistance force acting on the

accelerating body, Eq. (12) must be amended to include all forms of energy possessed by

the body.7-12  This calls for replacing 

0 0u V  in Eq. (12) with the body’s total energy, E.

Carrying this out and then inserting the total energy given by Eq. (14) leads to

According to stationary observers, this is the resistance force acting on a uniformly

simplify Eq. (15), we may consider a particular body accelerating uniformly along the

x−coordinate axis.  For this case, we may put12

Equation (17) is the total resistance force exerted on a body of mass 

0m  that is

accelerating uniformly through zero-point radiation.  With the exclusion of the first term,

Eq. (17) is identical to the inertial force derived on the basis of the ZPF hypothesis.1-4  In

fact, supporters of ZPF hypothesis claim that the inertial mass of an accelerating body

should be expressed entirely by the expression within parentheses, in the second term of

Eq. (17).  Clearly, this makes sense only when one chooses to set 

0m = .  This is nothing

0

more than a choice, of course; there exists no rational basis for purposely dismissing the

intrinsic mass-energy of matter.  The interaction between matter and zero-point radiation

must certainly lead to forces on accelerating objects,1-5 but such forces must arise in

addition to the inertial forces arising due to the intrinsic energy content of matter.

4.  Discussion and Conclusions

The zero-point field (ZPF) approach to the problem of inertia asserts that the origin of

inertia rests entirely with the interaction between the subatomic particles constituting

matter and vacuum electromagnetic zero-point radiation.1-5  As mentioned in the

Introduction, one problem with this approach is that it seems to disregard the intrinsic

energy content of matter.  According to the ZPF hypothesis, the rest mass-energy content

of matter is entirely kinetic energy of quarks and electrons induced by interaction with

zero-point radiation.1,4  Of course, the present analysis has adhered to the more traditional

interpretation that all forms of matter possess intrinsic rest mass-energy, and that all

forms of energy exhibit inertial properties in accordance with the law of inertia of energy,

E mc=

2

.7-12  Since subatomic particles such as quarks and electrons are each endowed

with an intrinsic rest mass-energy, it makes sense that these particles must possess

intrinsic inertial properties aside from zero-point phenomena.

Another problem with the ZPF hypothesis is that it suggests that the origin of the

inertial properties of matter rests solely with the inertial mass appearing in Newton’s

second law of motion, 1-5 while neglecting the crucial role played by space-time.7-12

Herein, it has been shown that ZPF-induced forces manifest directly due to the behavior

of space-time in accelerating systems, and that such forces act in addition to the inertial

forces arising due to the intrinsic energy content of matter.  Clearly, the only way zero-

point phenomena can be treated as the source of inertia is when the intrinsic energy

content of matter is intentionally ignored.  In the absence of any good reason for this, the

only rational conclusion to be had is that ZPF-induced forces are resistance forces acting

in addition to the intrinsic inertial properties of matter.

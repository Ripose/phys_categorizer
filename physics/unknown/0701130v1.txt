For  over  20  years  NASA  has  struggled  to  find  an  explanation  to  the 
Pioneer anomaly. Now it becomes clear the solution to the riddle is that 
they  have  uncovered  evidence  that  c,  the  speed  of  light,  is  not  quite  a 
universal  constant.  Using  J.  C.  Cure’s  hypothesis  that  the  index  of 
refraction  is  a  function  of  the  gravitational  energy  density  of  space  and 
straightforward  Newtonian  mechanics,  NASA’s  measurements  provide 
compelling evidence that the speed of light depends on the inverse of the 
square root of the gravitational energy density of space. The magnitude of 
the  Pioneer  anomalous  acceleration  leads  to  the  value  of  the  primordial 
energy density of space due to faraway stars and galaxies: 1.0838. x 1015 
Joule/m3.  A  value  which  almost  miraculously  coincides  with  the  same 
quantity:  1.09429  x  1015  Joule/m3  derived  by  J.  C.  Cure  from  a 
completely  different  phenomenon:  the  bending  of  starlight  during  solar 
eclipses.

Introduction 
Anderson and collaborators at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have reported [1] an 
apparent, weak, long range anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer 10 and 11 with 
supporting data from Galileo, and Ulysses spacecraft. [2, 3] Careful analysis of the Doppler 
signals from both spacecraft have shown the presence of an unmodeled acceleration 
towards the sun. By 1998 it was concluded from the analysis, that the unmodeled 
acceleration towards the Sun was (8.09 +/- 0.20) x 10-10 m/s2 for Pioneer 10 and of (8.56 
+/- 0.15) x 10-10 m/s2 for Pioneer 11. In a search for an explanation, the motions of two 
other spacecraft were analyzed:  Galileo in its Earth-Jupiter mission phase and Ulysses in a 
Jupiter-perihelion cruise out of the plane of the ecliptic. It was concluded that Ulysses was 
subjected to an unmodeled acceleration towards the Sun of (12 +/- 3) x 10-10 m/s2. To 
investigate this, an independent analysis was performed of the raw data using the 
Aerospace Corporation’s Compact High Accuracy Satellite Motion Program (CHASMP), 
which was developed independently of JPL. The CHASMP analysis of Pioneer 10 data also 
showed an unmodeled acceleration in a direction along the radial toward the Sun. The value 
is (8.65 +/- 0.03) x 10-10 m/s2, agreeing with JPL’s result. Aerospace’s analysis of Galileo 
Doppler data resulted in a determination for an unmodeled acceleration in a direction along 
the radial toward the Sun of, (8 +/- 3) x 10-10 m/s2, a value similar to that from Pioneer 10. 
All attempts at explanation of the unmodeled acceleration as the result of hardware or 
software problems at the spacecraft or at the tracking stations have failed. A very detailed 
description of the Pioneer anomaly, of the measurements and of the analysis was given by 
the JPL team [4]. Two conferences have been carried out on the subject, in 2004 [5] and in 
2005 [6] and although several explanations have been advanced, no clear consensus exists 
of the cause of the weak [7] anomalous acceleration experienced by the various spacecraft. 
With no plausible explanation so far, the possibility that the origin of the anomalous signal

is new physics has arisen.[8] Very recently evidence  of the puzzling phenomenon was 
found in the motion of other spacecraft. [9] 
The Pioneer anomalous acceleration  a  is derived from the Doppler drift

of  detected:

 In this paper the anomalous drift is shown to be due to 

a change of the index of refraction of vacuum, a function of the gravitational energy density 
of space predicted by the Curé hypothesis [10]. It affects  c  the speed of light in space far 
from the influence of the sun. 
 
1.- Energy density of space. 
By energy density of space we mean the classical energy density (Energy per unit volume) 
associated with the potential energy of all forms of force: electric, magnetic, gravitational 
or any other force in nature. In particular, to be associated to gravitational energy of nearby 
massive bodies such as the Sun and the Earth which we can readily calculate, and to the 
gravitational energy density produced by the gravitational field of the stars and far away 
galaxies, not so easily estimated. 
The energy density of space associated with the presence of static electric  E and magnetic 
B fields are given by:

with  G  the Universal constant of gravitation. Hence any volume of space is immersed in 
the universal primordial field of energy 
due to the presence of our own galaxy superimposed on the energy fields of all far-away 
galaxies. Thus the energy density in the surface of the Earth and in the proximity of the Sun 
is given by:

is 

Sρ = 2.097 x 104 Joules/m3. With the Earth’s acceleration of gravity the energy density 
Eρ  = 5.726 10+10 Joules/m3 and the universal primordial 

due to the Earth at the surface is 

 

 

2

 

 

 

energy density *ρ  is estimated [10] at 1.09429 x 1015 Joules/m3. This is a value arrived at by 
an analysis of the deflection of light by the Sun’s energy field considered as a refraction 
phenomenon as reviewed below. [11]  
J.C. Curé [10, p. 276] explains the energy density of space in the following illuminating 
words:  

“Every celestial body is surrounded by an invisible envelope of gravitostatic 
energy caused by the matter of the body and given by Eq. (104). (Our Eq. 4) To 
proceed with a colorful description, let us assign a yellow color to the sun’s 
gravitostatic energy. Let us picture the background cosmic energy with a bluish 
color. Now we can see, in our imagination, that the sun is surrounded with a 
green atmosphere of energy. The green color fades away into a bluish color as 
we recede from the sun.” 

 
2.- Effect of energy density of space  
Now let us consider the hypothesis that the speed of light is a function of the energy density 
of space  ρ which in the neighbourhood of the sun is determined by a constant background 
value due to the distant galaxies plus a smaller value due to the gravitational presence of the 
Sun’s mass as seen by (3) above.  
We assume the speed is inversely proportional to the square root of the energy density by 
the use of the Curé hypothesis [10, p 173] given by relation (5):

This implies that the speed of light decreases near the Sun and increases far away from the 
sun. We may then assign an index of refraction  n  to space such that  n  = 1 in vacuum space 
'n  < 1 far away from the Sun, in deep 
near the Earth, as we usually do, and assign an index 
space, where the speed of light

Strictly speaking, relation (7) should contain in the numerator and denominator the 
gravitational energy density due to all the other planets. However, the contribution is 
/1 r  factor in the energy density, unless 
negligible due to the 
planet. 
At this point it is fitting to address the order of magnitude of the quantities being discussed. 
With  n  = 1 at the Earth at 1 AU from the Sun, the index of refraction 
'n  further away from 
the Sun is dependent on the relative magnitudes of the energy density values that enter into 

'n  is being calculated near a

Eq. (7), i.e. the relative value of the Sun’s energy density, the Earth’s energy density and 
the primordial energy density

Sρ falls of rapidly as we go away from the Sun, see Fig. 

If we plot relation (4) we find that 
1, and it becomes negligible for distances of say  r  > 10 AU compared to the universal 
primordial energy density  estimated by Curé [10, p 279]  at 1.094291 x 1015 Joules m-3. 
'n  is smaller than one for  r  > 1 AU, and it is 
Entering these values into (7) we find that 
also smaller than one for  r  < 1 AU due to the energy density of the Earth which, near the 
surface, is much greater that the sun’s energy density. But the numerical value of 
nearly one, differing only by a very small amount (see Table I). Hence the values of the 
speed of light calculated at different distances from the Sun changes little from the 
accurately measured value on the surface of the Earth at a distance of 1 AU from the Sun. 
These minute changes in the speed of light or of the index of refraction of space are 
consistent with the tiny magnitudes of the accelerations reported by the Pioneer anomaly. 
With our knowledge of the energy density of the Sun and Earth, relation (7) for the index of 
*ρ , if we do 
'n  may be used to determine the primordial energy density of space,

The frequencies of signals received from spacecraft are affected by their movement through 
the Doppler Effect.  In fact the first order Doppler Effect is normally used to determine the 
speed of distant spacecraft. An accurate oscillator “clock” on board emits a signal in the 
form of an electromagnetic wave at a base frequency of . If the spacecraft moves at a 
velocity, v , relative to the receiving station the frequency  f  of the clock as perceived by 
the receiver is shifted from

This is the frequency received when  v  is in the direction away from the receiver, i. e. the 
signal of a receding spacecraft is Doppler-shifted towards lower frequencies (red-shifted). 
The reverse occurs if the spacecraft moves towards the receiver, in which case the received 
signal is Doppler-shifted towards higher frequencies (blue-shifted).  
Above we assumed a “clock” on board for clarity in the argument. However, in the case of 
the Pioneer spacecrafts this is not true. The signals transmitted by the Pioneer spacecrafts 
are re-transmission of Earth-sent signals. Assume the frequency transmitted from Earth 
is ef , the spacecraft is in motion relative to Earth hence the frequency of the signal received 
ef  but rather a Doppler shifted frequency of . The

4.- Effect of Gravity on speed of spacecraft 
A spacecraft that is receding into deep space away from the Sun does not move with a 
constant velocity. This is because it is affected by the gravitational attraction of the Sun. 

5

 

 

The effect is that the receding spacecraft is affected by a change of speed towards the Sun 
which is equal to the magnitude of the Sun’s acceleration of gravity at the position of the 
spacecraft. The acceleration is in the direction of the Sun which is approximately in a 
direction opposite to its receding speed. 
For a deep space probe spacecraft the acceleration a  is given from Newton’s second law by 
 with  F  the gravitational force of the Sun on the spacecraft and  m  the spacecraft 
mFa
mass.  F is given by Newton’s relation:

Now let us consider the effect on the Doppler signals on a spacecraft whose speed is

Relation (17) gives the “Excess“ Doppler signal that is detected by a receiving station on

Doppler frequency by the higher speed of light in the interstellar medium as compared with 
the speed of light,  c , on Earth.  
Upon examination of Eq. (17) we see that the term in the parenthesis, 
owing to the fact that 
'n  is smaller than one, but very near to one. At a distance of 20 AU

ef  = 2295 MHz and the “Excess” Doppler shift,

The value (21) is the result of an empirical measurement of the index of refraction of space 
at 20 AU by NASA’s careful measurements of Pioneer signals.   
With this value and the use of Eq. (8) we can calculate the primordial energy density of 
space *ρ , using the Sun’s and the Earth’s energy density at 1AU and at 20 AU. The value 
calculated is: 

'n at 20 AU from the Sun is:

The result of calculating the Pioneer anomaly predicted by (20) as a function of 

This value coincides with the value of 
the basis of an entirely different phenomenon: The bending of starlight rays by the 
gravitational field of the Sun. We outline here the calculation done by Jorge Céspedes-Curé 
[10, p. 279]. It consists of using the hypothesis of Eq. (5) interpreted as a change of the 
index of refraction of space, and using the analysis carried out by Prof. P. Merat [13] in 
1974 [10,  p 274] for 297 starlight deflections measured in 9 observations of 6 solar 
eclipses. With the results of Merat’s analysis of the astronomical observations of the 
bending of starlight rays by the gravitational field of the Sun, Curé determines the energy 
density of space.

distance is shown in Fig. 2.  To construct this curve the space energy density 
as an adjustable parameter. The value chosen  *ρ  = 0.25 x 1015 Joules/m3 gives a better fit 
around 30 AU to the experimentally measured anomalous acceleration as a function of 
heliocentric distance.[14] 
 
7.- Discussion.  
The measurements of the Pioneer anomaly are not very precise. They are of the same order 
of magnitude of the errors in the measurements and with this imprecision they do not show 
a clear variation with the distance to the sun. However, considering the wildly different, 
magnitudes of the data that enter the relations used to calculate the energy density given by 
(22) (Gravitational constant, mass of the Sun and Earth, both masses squared, speed of 
light, distance of Sun and Earth to spacecraft squared, both distances to the forth power, 
frequency and frequency drift of the Pioneer transmissions) it seems miraculous that the 
*ρ  in deep space differs by less than 1 %  of the value 
calculation of the energy density 
predicted by Curé on the basis of  a completely different phenomenon: starlight deflection 
by the Sun.

Figure 2. The Pioneer anomalous acceleration predicted with the theory as a function of the 
distance along a Sun-Earth radial line. (Radius of Earth = 4.26E-05 AU) The experimental 
data shown, obtained by NASA, was derived from Fig. 7 of Ref. [4]. 

 

 

  
The puzzling fact that the anomalous acceleration shown by Pioneer is not observed in the 
planets may be explained: The anomalous acceleration is not real, it is an artefact affecting 
Doppler measurements of bodies which are in a place where the index of refraction n’ ≠ 1 
and are in relative acceleration to Earth-bound observers. A Doppler probe on the surface 
of the planets will show an anomalous acceleration because the energy density of space 
there is different from the energy density on the surface of Earth. Hence the index of 
refraction  n′  on the surface of planets differs from Earth. Table I shows the results of 
calculating  n′  with the use of Eq. (7). The values close to 1.0 being caused by the local 
gravitational energy density being not so different from the surface of the Earth. Values of 
n′  above one indicate that a Doppler probe would show an anomalous acceleration in the 
direction opposite to the Sun and would be equal to the factor 
acceleration of the planet.

8.- Conclusion 
We find a neo-Newtonian explanation of the Pioneer anomaly. This is done with the Curé 
[10, p. 173] hypothesis that the speed of light at a site depends on the local space energy 
density predicted by Newton’s universal law of gravitation. With this hypothesis we have 
been able to deduce in a simple manner the empirically observed phenomenon of the 
Pioneer anomaly qualitatively and quantitatively. Additionally with the theory developed 
we are able to calculate the energy density of space produced by the rest of the Universe in 
the neighbourhood of the Sun. The value obtained (1.0838. x 1015 Joule/m3) coincides very 
closely with a value (1.09429 x 1015 Joule/m3) deduced by J. C. Curé [10, p. 279] on the 
basis of the empirical measurement of light bending by the Sun observed during solar 
eclipses. 
The anomalous acceleration does not exist. Pioneer 10 and 11 as well as Galileo and 
Ulysses spacecraft are moving according to Newton’s universal law of gravitation or 
according to Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity which coincide in this respect. The 
anomaly is found to be due to the effect on the Doppler signals by the index of refraction of 
space, which is to say the variation of the speed of light due to the energy density of space 
predicted by the Curé hypothesis. 
For further verification of the Curé hypothesis we suggest careful analysis of measurements 
done on the Pioneer spacecraft in the early stages of the flight, from launch to about 20 AU. 
Fortunately there are plans at JPL, motorized by S. G. Turyshev, to reanalyze all the data 
taken of the Pioneer missions, which have now been preserved. [8]  
NASA’s careful measurements and the Curé hypothesis that the speed of light at a site 
depends on the local space energy density which explain it have profound implications for 
physics and cosmology. A lot of other astronomical data needs to be examined in this 
context. Its acceptance on the basis of the evidence supplied by an explanation of the 
Pioneer anomaly and the light bending by the Sun obliges a careful revision of the 
interpretation of data used by Hubble to derive the hypothesis of the expansion of the 
universe and all the theoretical predictions which follow.

[14] Examination of the primary papers on the Pioneer anomaly do not give the measured Doppler drift 
frequency as a function of distance from the sun of the spacecraft. This information is undoubtedly contained 
in JPL or NASA reports. What is reported is the interpretation of the Doppler drift frequency as an 
unmodeled acceleration towards the Sun as a function of heliocentric distance. The data used in Fig. 2 was 
derived from Fig. 7 of Ref. [4].

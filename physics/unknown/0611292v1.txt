Abstract: We propose a new type of waveguide optical amplifier. The device consists of 
collinearly propagating pump and amplified Stokes beams with periodic imaging of the 
Stokes  beam  due  to  the  Talbot  effect.  The  application  of  this  device  as  an  Image 
preamplifier  for  Mid  Wave  Infrared  (MWIR)  remote  sensing  is  discussed  and  its 
performance is described. Silicon is the preferred material for this application in MWIR 
due  to  its  excellent  transmission  properties,  high  thermal  conductivity,  high  damage 
threshold  and  the  mature  fabrication  technology.  In  these  devices,  the  Raman 
amplification process also includes  four-wave-mixing between various spatial  modes of 
pump  and  Stokes  signals.  This  phenomenon  is  unique  to  nonlinear  interactions  in 
multimode  waveguides  and  places  a  limit  on  the  maximum  achievable  gain,  beyond 
which the image begins to distort. Another source of image distortion is the preferential 
amplification of Stokes modes that have the highest overlap with the pump. These effects 
introduce  a  tradeoff  between  the  gain  and  image  quality.  We  show  that  a  possible 
solution  to  this  trade-off  is  to  restrict  the  pump  into  a  single  higher  order  waveguide 
mode.

1.  Introduction 

The  stimulated  Raman  scattering  effect  has  been  used  successfully  to  realize  amplifiers  and  lasers  in 
various solid state media including optical fibers [1], semiconductors such as GaP [2], silicon [3] and more 
exotic solid state media such as, Ba(NO3)2, LiIO3, and KGd(WO4)2 etc [4]. The Raman process in general 
can  achieve  high  gains  by  using  suitable  interaction  lengths  and  modal  area  without  the  need  for 
complicated  phase-matching  schemes  as  in  the  case  of  Optical  Parametric  Oscillator  (OPO)  and  Optical 
parametric  amplifier  (OPA).    However,  for  high  power  applications,  direct  power-scaling  of  Raman 
amplifiers by increasing the pump power, keeping the modal area constant, is challenged by: (i) the lack of 
high power pump sources with good beam quality, and (ii) by the possibility of damaging the medium at 
high  optical  intensities.  Problems  also  exists  in  bulk  media  where  increasing  the  pump  power  results  in 
beam distortion due to thermal lensing and self focusing. These problems can be addressed by concomitant 
scaling of modal area with the increase in pump power. The scaling of pump power / modal area invariably 
results  in  multiple  spatial  modes  in  waveguide  structures.    The  Raman  interactions  in  the  presence  of 
multiple  spatial  modes  were  first  studied  by  Bloembergen  et  al.  [5-7],  who  described  interesting  effects 
such as increased Raman gain in an amplifier due to interaction of higher order pump and Stokes modes, 
and the so-called Raman beam clean-up effect. More recently the beam clean-up effect has been observed 
in bulk Raman crystals [4] and in multimode optical fibers [8].  
 
Certain multimode waveguide structures also exhibit Talbot self-imaging effect on account of constructive 
interference among the  various  waveguide  modes every periodic length [9]. This phenomenon also  takes 
place when the multimode waveguide is comprised of an optically amplifying medium. In such multimode 
waveguides with an active gain medium, the input electric field distribution is amplified and replicated at 
the focal points, which correspond to full Talbot planes. These amplifier configurations offer the benefits of 
good beam quality at the focal points along with better light-gain medium interaction and also reduction of 
deleterious  effects  such  as  self-focusing  and  thermal  lensing.  So  far,  the  use  of  amplifiers  with  Talbot 
imaging has been restricted to rare-earth doped solid state medium, with top or side pumping using diodes 
[10,11]. 
 
 In  this  paper  we  propose  a  multimode  silicon  waveguide  Raman  amplifier  that  consists  of  collinearly 
propagating mid infrared pump and Stokes beams. The waveguide amplifies and images the spatial profile 
of  an  input  beam.  We  describe  a  coupled-mode  analysis  that  includes  the  conventional  Raman 
amplification, and the  four-wave  mixing that occurs between spatial pump and  Stokes  modes, due to  the 
Raman nonlinearity. We find that the conventional Raman amplification term and the Raman Spatial FWM 
(RS-FWM)  start  to  distort  the  amplified  image  beyond  a  certain  waveguide  length  or  pump  power.  The 

prospects  of  using  this  device  as  an  image  preamplifier  in  MWIR  Laser  Radar  (LADAR)  are  discussed. 
Image amplifiers in the near-infrared region (~1-1.5m m) have been implemented in the past using rare earth 
doped fibers or other solid state media [12,13]. The recent progress made in the MWIR laser sources and 
the richness of the spectral signatures of molecules in these wavelengths has opened up new applications of 
MWIR sources in LADAR and standoff chemical detection [14]. The range and sensitivity of these remote 
sensing applications can be improved by the use of an optical preamplifier before signal detection.   
 
The  requirements  imposed  on  a  gain  medium  for  the  image  amplifier  includes  low  linear  and  nonlinear 
optical  loss  at  both  the  pump  and  Stokes  wavelengths,  high  optical  damage  threshold,  high  Raman  gain 
coefficient,  high  thermal  conductivity  and  the  availability  of  large  samples  with  high  crystal  quality.    A 
material  that  meets  all  these  criteria  in  the  MWIR  is  single  crystal  silicon.  In  all  respects,  silicon  is  an 
excellent  choice  for  the  high  power  MWIR  applications,  especially  since  the  problem  of  two  photon 
excitation  and  free  carrier  absorption  are  eliminated  when  the  pump  wavelength  is  longer  than  the  two-
photon  absorption  edge  of  2.3  µm  [15].  Such  a  technology  will  also  benefit  from  the  mature  silicon 
fabrication processes. Moreover, the device offers large field-of-view image amplification due to the high 
numerical aperture of the multimode Silicon waveguide.  
 

2.  Modeling of a multimode Raman amplifier 

Multimode interference in passive waveguides have applications in optical splitters and couplers, a detailed 
account of which can be found in ref [9]. The multimode silicon waveguides analyzed in this work consist 
of  a  silicon  thin  film  structure  as  shown  in  figure  1.  The  waveguide  width,  a  =  80m m,  and  its  thickness 
b=50m m.  Under  symmetric  (on-axis)  launch  with  a  40m m  beam,  the  optical  power  is  coupled  mainly 
(~98%) in the fundamental mode in the Y-direction and the multimode nature of the waveguide considered 
in  the  X-direction.  This  simplifies  the  numerical  solutions  and  helps  to  elucidate  the  key  features  of  the 
device, without loss of generality. The analysis can be naturally extended to other waveguide dimensions.

where Amn and b mn are the mode coefficient and propagation constant for the mode (m,n). The multimode 
imaging phenomenon arises due to the periodic constructive interference of the modes in the waveguide at 
the focal points, where the input profile is essentially reproduced. The focal points occurs periodically at 
intervals [9]:

where, even and odd values of p lead to original and reversed images of the input beam respectively. The 
self-imaging points which reproduce the original image are referred to as focal points in this paper. For the 
passive  device  (ie.  no  gain),  the  mode  coefficients  Amn  are  essentially  constant  along  the  waveguide. 
However, in the case of the active device (ie. for a Raman amplifier) to be considered next, the evolution of 
the mode coefficients along the waveguide are also to be accounted for.  
 
Table 1 lists the parameters used in the simulations. It was found that for the launch condition considered, 
11  modes  along  the  X-direction  and  1  mode  along  the  Y-direction  accounted  for  ~  98%  of  the  coupled 
optical  power  and  was  sufficient  for  the  purpose  of  this  simulation.  Based  on  the  parameter  as  listed  in 
Table I, imaging length at the pump and Stokes wavelengths computed using Eq. (4) are ~ 6cm and 5.07cm 
respectively. The imaging lengths are slightly different due to chromatic dispersion.

This set of coupled-mode equations for a multimode waveguide can be considered as an extension of the 
two-mode treatment presented in ref. [16] for the case of optical fibers. Here, AS-mn and AP-mn refer to the 
Stokes and pump mode coefficients respectively for mode index (m,n), f S-mn  and   f P-mn   refer to the mode 
profiles of  the  Stokes and pump as  given by Eq. (1),         a S-mn and  a P-mn refer to the linear propagation 
losses  of  the  modes,  which  in  general  can  be  different  for  different  modes, 
  refer  to  the 
kl
coupling coefficients of the Raman interaction process and D
 refers to the phase mismatch for the Raman 
Spatial FWM (RS-FWM) process which is described below. We have ignored the RS-FWM terms which 
are highly oscillatory as this behavior is expected to wash away its contribution. Throughout this analysis 
we assume that the waveguide eigenmodes do not change as a result of the nonlinear polarization effects. 
This is valid as c
(1) and hence the third order polarization P(3) is 
much weaker than P(1). Thus the only effect of the nonlinear interaction is to alter the amplitude and phase 
of the mode coefficients. The Raman gain experienced by the Stokes modes is represented by the coupling 
coefficient,
,  which  are  functions  of  the  Raman  susceptibility  and  the  extent  of  overlap

among  the  interacting  modes.  Eqs  (5.1)  and  (5.2)  do  not  include  self  phase  and  cross  phase  modulation 
effects. This assumption is valid because for the input intensity levels considered here (up to 25 MW/cm2), 

the  nonlinear  length,   

  [1],  is  ~13cm,  which  is  larger  than  the  typical  waveguide  length

considered  in  this  analysis  (~5cm).    Any  effect  of  self-phase  and  cross-phase  modulation  becomes 
pronounced only at lengths comparable to the nonlinear length.  
 
There are two types of Raman interactions which occur in a multimode waveguide. The first term on the 
right  hand  side  of  Eq.  (5.1)  is  the  conventional  Raman  amplification  of  the  Stokes  signal.  The 
corresponding  gain  is  independent  of  the  pump  phase  as  it  is  only  proportional  to  the  pump  intensity,

The  second  terms  on  the  right  hand  side  of  Eq.  (5.1)  describes  RS-FWM  terms  which  arise  due  to  the 
mixing of the different spatial modes of pump and Stokes signals. This term has the expected dependence 
of FWM on phase mismatch (Eq. (5.5)). If phase matching can be ensured this term will contribute to the 
overall gain and will be beneficial as it leads to gain enhancement. The gain enhancement was predicted by 
Bloembergen  [5]  and  has  been  observed  in  the  form  of  reduced  pump  threshold  for  stimulated  Raman 
scattering in a gas cell [6,7].

In the context of image amplification, there are two mechanisms that can affect the desired self-imaging of 
the amplified Stokes beam. Both lead to a trade-off between the achievable gain and the reproducibility and 
quality of the Stokes image at focal points. First, with increasing length and pump power the Stokes modes 
which  have  highest  overlap  with  the  pump  modes  experience  higher  gains  compared  to  the  other  Stokes 
modes. This leads to preferential amplification of certain Stokes modes and hence distortion of the image. 
Secondly,  the  RS-FWM  effect  changes  the  phases  of  Stokes  mode  coefficients  and  further  affects  the 
image. The RS-FWM effect has another implication as can be seen in the 2nd term on the right side of Eq. 
(5.1),  when  multiple  free  running  pump  lasers  are  used  to  provide  high  pump  powers,  the  transfer  of 
random pump phases to the amplified Stokes modes can also degrade the image quality.  
 
For  MWIR  applications  considered  here,  the  pump  and  Stokes  photons  are  below  the  two-photon 
bandedge,  hence  two-photon  absorption  and  the  concomitant  free-carrier  losses  are  nonexistent  [15]. 
Silicon being indirect bandgap is expected to have insignificant three-photon absorption when compared to 
other shorter bandgap semiconductors such as GaAs [18].  
 
The coupled mode equations presented above were solved numerically using a finite difference algorithm. 
The simulator grid size in the x, y and z directions are taken to be 1m m, 2m m and 100m m respectively. For 
the purpose of studying the Raman amplification process, the input pump was considered to be 1KW peak 
power or 1mW average power at the wavelength of 2.936m m. This may be achievable in solid-state laser 
systems  under  quasi-CW  conditions  at  energy  levels  of  ~100m J  over  100nsec  pulse  [19]. The  input  peak 
intensity of the pump is ~25MW/cm2 and is comparable to the intensities used in the near infrared to study 
Raman scattering in silicon. The multimode Raman amplifier presented in this work is power scalable and 
the Raman amplification process can be made to work at lower or higher power levels through appropriate 
waveguide dimension scaling. This would also change the imaging length as given by Eq. (4). The input 
Stokes beam is assumed to be at 1m W at 3.466m m  wavelength.  Figure 2 shows the electric-field contour 
(X-Z  profile)  of  the  pump  and  Stokes  as  they  propagate  along  the  waveguide.  The  amplification  of  the 
Stokes is clearly noticeable along with the self-imaging effect. The pump is not significantly depleted due 
to  the  weak  input  Stokes  beam.  It  is  found  that  the  pump  and  Stokes  fields  self-image  much  more 
frequently than the focal length as calculated using eq. (4). This is due to the fact that we have considered a 
symmetrical input field in this example. In this case, the image will reproduce itself 8 times within the focal 
length of a general input field, Limage, described by Eq. (4)  [9].  
 
 Figure  3  shows  the  small  signal  Raman  gain  that  can  be  achieved  along  the  waveguide  for  varying 
waveguide propagation losses. The vertical dashed lines denote the location of the 1st and 2nd focal points. 
For the case of zero loss, Raman gain of 10dB is reached at the first focal point for peak pump power levels 
of ~1KW. For such large area silicon waveguide, losses are expected to be on the order of 0.1dB/cm [17]. 
As seen in this figure, for the propagation losses considered here, 0.1dB/cm, 0.2dB/cm and 0.5dB/cm, the 
gain at the first imaging length are 9dB, 8dB, and 5dB, respectively.  
 
The impact of linear losses need to be explained. If the linear losses increase with the mode number then a 
spatial  low-pass  filtering  will  occur  as  the  amplitudes  of  the  higher  modes  are  diminished,  while  their 
phases remain unaffected. This would be the case if losses occur primarily on the waveguide surfaces. In 
addition, propagation losses also impact the image quality by diminishing the contribution of the RS-FWM 
effect as the image propagates along the waveguide.

To assess the impact of Raman interaction on the self imaging phenomenon,  we have computed the  well 
known M2 parameter  for the  beam profile, and its evolution along the  waveguide.  Following the known 
procedure [20], the  M2 parameter  was computed by  taking  the  Fourier transform of the transversal beam 
profile.  The  M2  parameter  indicates  deviations  from  a  Gaussian  profile  with  M2=1  corresponding  to  an 
ideal  Gaussian  beam,  such  as  the  input  profile  considered  in  the  present  case.    Figure  4  shows  the  M2 
parameter  for  the  Stokes  beams  for  the  following  cases:  (a)  Stokes  beam  propagating  in  a  passive 
waveguide  without  Raman amplification (no pump) and (b) in the presence of Raman amplification  with 
input  pump  intensities  of  25  and  50  MW/cm2.  The  input  beam  is  found  to  reproduce  itself  periodically 
along  the  waveguide  with  M2  reaching  it  minima  at  focal  points.  In  the  absence  of  Raman  interactions 
(Figure 4(a)) self imaging is  perfect  with  M2=1 reproduced at all focal points. In the presence of  Raman 
amplification however, the image begins to be distorted while it is amplified along the waveguide (figure 
4(b)).  This  distortion  in  image  quality  is  found  to  be  more  significant  with  increase  in  pump  power  and 
waveguide length. The slight increase in M2 at focal points (leading to loss of image quality) and the overall 
reduction  in  its  average  value  are  due  to  the  preferential  amplification  of  the  fundamental  mode.  The 
periodicity of M2 along the  waveguide length is also  modulated by ripples due to the  RS-FWM terms in 
Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2) by contributing addition phase factors  to the  mode coefficients. Thus, it is clear that 
there  exists  a  tradeoff  between  the  amount  of  gain  that  can  be  achieved  and  the  image  distortion.  From 
figures 3 and 4 it  is  found that gains close to 10dB can be achieved in  waveguide lengths of ~5cm  with 
minimal image distortion. 
 
 
3.  Image Amplification 
 
The range and sensitivity of LADAR (Laser Detection And Ranging) and remote sensing systems can be 
improved by the use of optical preamplifiers before detection. So far, efforts to implement optical image 
preamplifiers have been mainly focused on near infrared LADAR systems using doped fiber, YAG-based 
amplifiers and Barium Nitrate Raman medium [12, 21, 13]. There is increasing interest in LADAR systems 
operating  in  the  MWIR  due  to  strong  vibrational  resonance  of  molecules  in  this  range  and  the  recent 
availability of efficient MWIR laser sources [14]. Moreover, the solid-state Raman media used previously 
for image amplification consisted of a bulk crystal with no waveguiding [13]. The lack of waveguiding, and 
hence  self  imaging,  limits  the  interaction  length  before  image  quality  is  deteriorated.  The  waveguide 
implementation introduced here increases the length over which image quality can be maintained and also 
reduces the threshold pump power through confinement of the pump mode. The use of silicon as the active 
medium also provides many advantages such as a high Raman coefficient, high thermal conductivity, high 
optical damage threshold, and mature fabrication technology.  
 
To assess the performance of the device as an image amplifier, simple test images were launched into the 
device  input  and  its  evolution  through  the  waveguide  was  computed  using  the  methodology  described 
above.  Fig.  5  shows  the  cross-sectional  amplitude  profiles  at  the  input  and  output  at  the  first  imaging 
length. For the purpose of this simulation we have considered 20 waveguide modes along the X-direction 
and 1 mode along the Y-direction. We emphasize the transversal profile is shown here as opposed to the 
longitudinal view shown in Fig. 2. A pump beam with 1KW peak (1mW average) power is assumed to be 
launched centered with respect to the waveguide. The periodic patterns considered here are 50, 100 and 200 
lines per mm ruling. The center portion of the image appears brighter than the edges due to the preferential 
amplification of the fundamental Stokes modes. The deterioration is more severe when the image contains 
higher  spatial  frequencies.  Nonetheless  the  rulings  are  clearly  resolvable  at  amplification  level  (~10dB 
gain).  
 
 The  preferential  amplification  of  the  fundamental  Stokes  mode  leading  to  loss  of  image  quality  can  be 
eliminated using selective pump mode excitation as described below.

25MW/cm2 and 50MW/cm2.  Pump powers are 1KW peak (1mW average) and 2KW peak (2mW 
average).    The  M2  parameter  is  a  measure  of  the  image  quality  at  the  focal  points  with  an  ideal 
value  of  unity.  The  image  deteriorates  (M2  increases)  with  increase  in  pump  power  due  to 
preferential amplification of fundamental Stokes mode in comparison with higher order modes, and 
the presence of the phase-sensitive Raman four wave mixing.

4.  Distortion-free image amplification using a single, high-order pump mode excitation 
 
From the analysis of Raman amplification in a multimode waveguide with Gaussian-like transverse pump 
profile  presented  in  sections  2  and  3  it  is  clear  that  there  is  a  trade-off  between  the  amount  of  image 
amplification and the distortion experienced by the image. However, there exists a special case in  which 
distortion-free image amplification is possible. Since the pump is at a lower  wavelength than  the Stokes, 
the pump field supports more waveguide modes than the Stokes field. By propagating the pump only in a 
higher order mode which the Stokes image does not support, it is possible to eliminate the two sources of 
image  distortion  discussed  in  section  2.  The  RS-FWM  terms  vanish  because  the  pump  being  in  a  single 
mode prevents the pump mode mixing effect (2nd term on RHS of Eqs. 5.1 and 5.2). Let M be the index for 
the  excited  pump  mode  and  m<M  be  the  Stokes  mode  index.  With  k=M,  the  self-coupling  coefficient 
simplifies to:

which  is  independent  of  m,  and  hence  is  a  constant  for  all  Stokes  modes.  In  this  case  the  coupled  mode

The exponential term represents the Raman gain experienced by the mode and is uniform for all the Stokes 
modes. Thus distortion free amplification is possible without trading off the gain. Selective mode excitation 
in multimode fibers is typically used for reducing the impact of modal dispersion in data communication 
applications  [22].  Such  techniques  will  prove  powerful  in  utilizing  the  full  potential  of  the  silicon  image 
amplifier. 
 
5.     Conclusions 

 

In this paper we have proposed and analyzed a novel Raman amplifier in a multimode silicon waveguide. 
This  amplifier  consists  of  collinearly  propagating  pump  and  Stokes  beams  which  are  periodically  self-
imaged along the waveguide length. This ensures that the Stokes beam gets amplified and also reconstructs 
its  profile  at  the  focal  points.  We  have  also  analyzed  an  application  of  this  amplifier  as  an  image  pre-
amplifier for MWIR remote sensing applications. The use of a multimode silicon waveguide as the active 
medium,  with  mature  processing  technology,  large  field-of-view  and  excellent  thermal,  damage  and 
transmission  properties  in  the  MWIR  lends  itself  to  diverse  image  amplification  applications.  We  have 
performed coupled-mode analysis of multimode waveguides including the conventional Raman terms and 
the phase-sensitive  Raman four-wave  mixing terms. We find that there are two different contributions  to 
image distortion: (i) the conventional Raman terms can lead to preferential amplification of certain modes 
with the highest coupling coefficients at the expense of the other modes, and (ii) the RS-FWM terms which 
lead to phase distortions of the Stokes images and hence affect the self-imaging property. These introduce a 
tradeoff between the gain and image quality. One possible solution that can overcome this trade-off is to 
restrict the pump to a single high order spatial mode.

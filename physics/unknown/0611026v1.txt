Abstract: 

Nanoindentation tests were performed at several temperatures (24 to 80°C) on one antiwear zinc 

dialkyl-dithiophosphate (ZDTP) tribofilm using a Nanoindenter XP® entirely set into a climatic 

chamber. Mechanical properties of the tribofilm were determined using a simple model. AFM 

observations were conducted to estimate the order of magnitude of the film’s thickness. The effect of 

applied pressure on the elastic properties was demonstrated and taken into account in the present 

analysis. The use of the (

F

)2

S

 parameter, independent of contact geometry, revealed a hardness 

dependency upon temperature. Furthermore, careful AFM observations of the residual pile-up 

produced by plastic flow around the indents pointed out the evolution of the film deformation process 

with temperature.

1.  Introduction 

Since the 40’s, Zinc dialkyl-dithiophosphates (ZDTP) are high performance lubricant additives 

which are extensively used because of their good antioxidant and antiwear properties. Many 

researches have been carried out on these additives in order to better understand how tribofilms are 

formed and how they act inside contacts. Nevertheless, faced with more and more restrictive rules 

concerning sulphur and phosphorous contents in lubricants, the aim is now to reduce the use of ZDTP 

and to develop less pollutant new antiwear additives [1]. 

Most of these studies deal with the chemical aspect of the formation and action of ZDTP 

tribofilms [2-5] but few are connected with their own mechanical behaviour [6-9]. The main reason is 

that mechanical measurements are difficult to perform on such films: ZDTP tribofilms are very thin, 

with a patchy pattern which results in a great inhomogeneity in shape and thickness. Pads are about 10 

to 100 µm long and less than 10 µm wide. Their thickness ranges from a few tens to a few hundreds of 

nanometers. 

Nanoindentation has revealed itself to be an efficient method for measuring near surface 

mechanical properties and particularly thin films ones. However, in the case of thin films, composite 

mechanical properties, which take into account both the film’s and the substrate’s properties, are 

measured. In order to overcome this difficulty, a simple model was used to extract film’s modulus 

from the composite one [10]. Furthermore, it is known that pressure influences elastic properties of 

polymer-like materials [11]. Such behaviour has been evidenced for ZDTP tribofilms [6] and has been 

taken into account in this study. 

It is also worth noting that, as far as we know, all published results concern measurements made 

at ambient temperature although service conditions are around 80°C. In this study, nanoindentation 

tests were performed on a Nanoindenter XP®, entirely set into a climatic chamber, which permits 

measurements between -50 and 100°C. So, mechanical properties of ZDTP films have been measured 

from ambient temperature to 80°C.

Post indentation AFM observations at room temperature have also been performed in order to 

estimate the thickness of the indented pads and to quantify pile-up around the residual indents. 

2. Experimental details 

2.1. Sample preparation 

 

 

 

The tribofilm was formed on a Cameron-Plint tribometer using a cylinder (6 mm long and 6 mm 

in diameter) sliding against a flat, both in AISI 52100 steel. The sliding distance was 7 mm long at a 

frequency of 7 Hz. The lubricant was a synthetic base oil poly alpha olefin (PAO) with 3% in weight 

ZDTP. The applied normal load was progressively increased to 350 N during the friction test and then 

maintained constant (total test duration: 1 hour). The test temperature was kept constant at 80°C. 

Optical microscopy observations confirmed the patchy structure of the ZDTP tribofilm. 

2.2. Nanoindentation tests 

measurement method [12-14]. 

Nanoindentation tests were performed with a Nanoindenter XP® using the continuous stiffness 

This method consists in superimposing a small displacement oscillation (small enough to 

generate only an elastic strain) at a given frequency during the indentation test. So, the sample endures 

small loading-unloading cycles. The simultaneous measurement of the normal force and the contact 

stiffness allows us to scan mechanical properties, hardness, H, and Young’s modulus, E, continuously 

along the whole indentation period. 

Thanks to the climatic chamber (Fig. 1 a & b), nanoindentation tests have been performed at 24, 

40, 60 & 80°C. The maximum applied load was 10 mN, at a constant strain rate, 

, of 3.10-2 s-1,

where F is the normal load. The optical microscope integrated in the device allowed us to precisely 

define the indentation location and to verify the position of the residual indents.

The small superimposed displacement had an amplitude of 1.5 nm at a frequency of 32 Hz. The 

blowing fan frequency of the heating system has been set at 12 Hz during experiments in order to 

Corrections have been made to prevent errors due to the geometry of the contact area. 

Preliminary indents were done on fused silica in order to characterize the tip defect of the Berkovich 

tip (three side pyramid with an angle of 115,12° between edges). AFM observations were used to 

obtain topographic information concerning pile-up around the indents, necessary to determine actual 

More than 10 indents have been performed for each temperature at different places on the

between actual contact area (taking into account pile-up) versus theoretical triangular area. The order 

of magnitude of 

2Ψ was estimated using AFM observations. The contact radius,  a , corresponding to

In the case of thin films deposited on a substrate, 

*

cE  is a composite modulus. It is a function of 

both the film and the substrate elastic properties and of the film thickness. 

Several models can be used to extract the film elastic property from the composite one [15-18]. 

The model developed by S. Bec & al. [10] has the advantage of being simple and it does not need the 

use of an adjustable parameter nor the knowledge of the Poisson’s ratio of the film and the substrate. 

S. Bec & al. consider that the film + substrate system can be modelled by two springs connected 

in series. Considering suitable boundary conditions, the composite modulus can be expressed from

Where t is the film’s thickness, 

*

fE and 

*

sE are respectively the film’s and substrate’s reduced 

Young’s moduli. Thus, the knowledge of the two parameters, t and 

*

sE (220 GPa for the AISI 52100 

steel substrate), allows us to determine the reduced Young’s modulus, 

*

fE , of the film. 

2.4. Anvil effect 

It is known that hydrostatic pressure influences elastic properties of polymers and polymer-like 

materials [11, 19]. As the film is trapped between the diamond indenter and the steel substrate and 

5 

cannot flow, the contact pressure i.e. the hardness, has the same order of magnitude as the hydrostatic 

pressure. This is called Anvil effect: the elastic modulus increases with hydrostatic pressure. 

For ZDTP tribofilms, similar effect was observed takes place from a threshold hardness value, 

0H . Thus, for contact pressure lower than 

0H , the film’s modulus is constant. For contact pressure 

higher than 

0H , the film’s modulus increases linearly with hardness. This was interpreted like an 

accommodation process to the severity of contact conditions [6] 

This effect was taken into account in the model used to determine the film’s reduced Young’s 

A VEECO® CP-II Atomic Force Microscope was used to perform observations of the indents 

and particularly of the pile-up at their periphery at room temperature. 

Because of the very low load, the residual indents were about 2 or 3 µm in diameter. Even if we 

could observe them with optical microscopy, AFM permitted high three dimensional resolution and 

topography measurements. Thereby, pads height could be estimated and pile-up around the indents 

could be quantified in order to obtain reliable hardness values considering actual contact area. 

AFM was used in contact mode with sharp silicon probes coated with gold. For each indent, 

large images of the whole pad, images of the indent itself and detailed image of the pile-up around the 

modulus,

indent were carried out. 

 

3.  Results and discussion 

3.1. AFM observations 

 

 

 

 

6 

Fig. 3 shows an error mode AFM image of two residual indentation prints made on the same pad 

at 24°C (Fig. 3a) and 80°C (Fig. 3b). The error observation mode is similar to a derivative image of 

the topography image. Therefore, changes in colour are linked to changes in surface slope. That is why 

such images were used to measure actual contact areas and thus to access to 

2Ψ  value. If pile-up is 

not taken into consideration, this results in overestimating modulus and hardness values. Because of 

the irregular “stairs-like” shape of the pile-up around the indents, it was difficult to measure the actual 

contact area. Neverthless, taking  Ψ =1.2, which is the standard value used in similar conditions, gives 

a good estimation of the contact area. In the following the same value of  Ψ  was used for all tests, at 

all temperatures. 

On the other hand, topography AFM images were used in order to estimate the order of 

magnitude of the pad height. For the indents made on the same pad at 24 and 80°C, the height of the 

pad was estimated around 250±50 nm. 

Moreover, it can be notice a reproducible difference between the pile-up formed at 24°C (Fig. 

3a) and 80°C (Fig. 3b). Pile-up, which is stable with time, seems to have been formed by successive 

pronounced steps at 24°C whereas, at 80°C it seems to result from a more continuous flow of matter. 

This may denote different deformation processes between these two temperatures. Additional studies 

are in progress to further investigate this phenomenon (strain rate dependency, larger temperature 

range, …). 

3.2. Film’s modulus 

 

 

 

AFM topography measurements allowed us to estimate the film thickness. This value is one of 

the parameter necessary to calculate the film reduced modulus, 

*

fE , from the measured composite 

modulus with our model. The pads height was estimated at about 250±50 nm. This value was refined 

by fitting the calculated composite modulus curve with the measured one. The AISI 52100 steel 

substrate reduced modulus value, 

*

sE , was taken to 220 GPa . 

7 

Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the film modulus and hardness versus plastic depth for one indent 

at 24°C. The film modulus and the hardness are first constant at respective values 

*

fE  and 

0

0H , until a 

depth 

0'rh and then increase. Similar curves were obtained for all indents at all temperatures. 

For hardness values higher than the threshold value 

0H , the film’s modulus curve can be fitted, 

as expected from [6], by a linear function of the hardness,  H  (Eq. 6)

Eq. 6 

As an illustration, Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the film modulus versus hardness for two 

indents performed on the same pad at 24°C and 80°C. For all tests the film modulus, 

fE , was found 

*

0

to be independent of temperature, at a value 

*

fE ≈ 39±4 GPa. On the opposite, the threshold contact

pressure, 

0H  was found to be temperature dependent. The threshold value of contact pressure at 24°C 

is about twice the threshold value at 80°C. 

 

Fig. 6a & 6b show the evolution of the composite modulus, 

*

cE , versus the indentation depth, 

'rh  calculated from using 

fE  value in our model. From the black curve (symbol (cid:1)) on Fig. 6, an 

*

0

increase of the composite Young’s modulus is observed as the contact depth increases. For contact 

pressure under the threshold value, this increase is only due to the influence of the substrate. That is 

why, for shallow indentation depth, the composite modulus calculated with our model and a constant 

film modulus 

fE  fits well the measured one (red curves, symbol (cid:1)). 

*

0

For deeper indentation, the calculated curve deviates from the measured composite modulus. 

The effect of hydrostatic pressure becomes significant. 

From the threshold pressure 

0H , which corresponds to the indentation depth 

0'rh  where the  

model deviates from the experimental data, the film’s modulus is considered to increase with the 

pressure as defined in Eq. 6. Using this increasing value for the film modulus gives a better fit of the 

 

8 

calculated composite modulus curve with the measured one for indentation depth deeper than 

0 'rh  

(blue curves, symbol (cid:1)). 

3.3. Temperature effects 

In order to better evidence the temperature effects on mechanical properties, the (

F

)2

 

S

parameter [normal load divided by contact stiffness squared] versus stiffness was chosen. It was 

plotted versus the contact stiffness, S, which is proportional to indentation depth, because it is a direct 

measurement not affected by contact geometry considerations. Thus, S is more accurate than 

indentation depth for measurements made on the same pads. 

(

F

)2

S

 parameter is independent of geometrical considerations inherent to nanoindentation 

contact modelling [20]. Moreover, (

F

 parameter is proportional to (

H

 ratio. As it was just

shown that the Young’s modulus of the ZDTP film is constant in the studied temperature range, 

variations in this parameter are due to variations in hardness,  H .

From Fig. 7, it can be observed, for two indentations made on the same pad at 24°C and 80°C , 

 parameter decreases rapidly for small stiffness values (corresponding to shallow 

indentation depths). For high stiffness values, it tends to an asymptotic value corresponding to a 

greater influence of the substrate on stiffness. For low stiffness, the (

F

parameter measured at

S

24°C is significantly higher than at 80°C. As the film modulus is the same at both temperatures, this 

corresponds to a significant difference in hardness values: ZDTP film’s hardness is about twice lower 

at 80°C than at 24°C. 

Fig. 8 shows (

F

S

 parameter for several indentations made at different temperatures on 

different pads. The decrease in hardness with increasing temperature is confirmed independently of the 

 

9 

chosen pad. Scattering of values might be due to thickness difference between pads. It is more 

pronounced at high temperature where experiments are more delicate to conduct. 

 

4. Conclusions and prospects 

First, nanoindentation tests were made on a patchy ZDTP tribofilm at several temperatures, up 

to 80°C. The highest temperature, 80°C, is near service temperature. Careful analysis of the obtained 

data allowed us to extract the film’s Young’s modulus. Its independence with temperature variations 

in the studied range which extends from 24 to 80°C was shown. On the other hand, the study of the 

 parameter versus stiffness allowed us to point out an important decrease in hardness while the 

(

F

)2

S

temperature increases. 

Second, AFM observations have been used to quantify the pile-up around indentation print and 

to estimate the height of the pad. These parameters were necessary to extract the Young’s modulus of 

the film from composite properties. Moreover, the observation of the pile-up around the indents 

revealed a difference between deformation processes depending on temperature. 

Thus, the next step of this study will be the investigation of the viscous-plastic properties of 

these films against temperature in order to better understand the different behaviours highlighted by 

AFM observations and to try to relate them to physical changes due to temperature increase.

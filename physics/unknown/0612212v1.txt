Abstract :   A   coherent   microwave   radiation   had   been   observed,   in   the   first   time   to   our 

knowledge, during experiments of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in weakly compressed 

hydrogen, simultaneously with the emission of  Raman lines. The intensity of this microwave 

radiation had been studied as a function of the gas pressure, and the product of the laser and 

Stokes wave powers. Moreover, the intensity spread from the propagation axis of the laser 

beam had been measured, just as the wavelength of centimetric order of magnitude, and an 

estimate of the peak power for this microwave emission. 

A phenomenological interpretation of this coherent microwave radiation in SRS with 

hydrogen is proposed, assuming that an intermediate quasiparticle state, vibrationally excited 

during a very short time (10-13–10-12 s), should be taken into account, just as a macroscopic 

longitudinal electric field. Moreover, a nonlinear coupling of anharmonic character, between 

the Stokes wave and the longitudinal waves associated to the quasiparticle system, is taken 

into account. Besides, this system might get a “piezoelectric” character under the mechanical 

action of the laser field. On the other hand, a Cherenkov-type and an anomalous relativistic 

Doppler effects are also assumed. Then, it has been found that the in phase quadrature part of 

the longitudinal component of the polarisation associated to the quasiparticle waves, might 

be the source of the coherent microwave radiation, emitted during parametric instabilities, the 

duration of which should be 10-13-10-12 s.

 

Concerning the SRS process itself, we note that an enhancement of the Raman gain 

might be due to an additional term arising from the electro-optic effect induced by the electric 

field of the laser beam; this term should be effective, only for durations of the same order of 

magnitude as for the microwave  emission.

I-Introduction.- First of all, we want to present some qualitative results, obtained a long time 

ago,   when   studies   of   radiations   emitted   in   the   infrared   region,   during   SRS   experiments 

performed with a Q-switched ruby laser in weakly compressed hydrogen, had been carried out. 

As a matter of fact, using a filter of silicon after the pressure cell, we had observed fortuitously 

a new kind of radiation provided by our infrared detector, a high-speed Ge:Au one working at 

the liquid nitrogen temperature and sensitive to infrared radiations up to 9 m m, and supplied by 

the manufacturer Santa Barbara Research Centre, Goleta, Cal.(USA), as we are going to show 

it below. It is truthful that possibilities of common artefacts had  existed, due to the radiations 

emitted by the flash- lamp of our Q-switched ruby laser, and by the electric discharges in the 

laser  equipment, or  by the plasma  induced in   hydrogen by the  laser  field. Consequently, 

different   tests   were   carried   out   to   show   that   we   had   observed   effectively   a   new   type   of 

radiation, as follows: 1) the signal obtained by means of our Ge:Au detector had a shape which 

is very different from those of the laser, Raman and flash-lamp pulses (see Fig.2); 2) at the 

pressure of one bar no stimulated Raman lines had been observed, and no signal detected with 

our Ge:Au detector; 3) with argon gas instead of hydrogen, no signal had be seen, originating 

from  the light emitted by the  laser-induced plasma; 4)  by means  of  an aperture of  3 mm 

diameter laid on the Ge:Au detector, only infrared radiations due to SRS in weakly compressed 

hydrogen   had   been   observed;   5)   with   a   black   paper   before   the   normal   aperture   of   2   cm 

diameter, only the new radiation had been observed; 6) in liquid water and gaseous ammonia, 

absorptions of this radiation were detected.  

Afterwards,   new   experiments   have   been   carried   out   more   recently,   to   yield 

quantitative   data   as   a   function   of   several   parameters,   published   in   a   short   paper   [1]. 

Nevertheless, a more detailed description of these experimental studies is given in Section II 

of the present paper. Furthermore, in Section III is presented an attempt to interpret this new 

type of radiation, appearing together with SRS in hydrogen. In Section IV a large discussion 

is given about similarities and differences between the physical process studied in this paper 

and others nonlinear phenomena. Finally, Section V is devoted to some remarks about the 

2

experimental SRS gains, which had been found above the SRS threshold, very much greater 

than the theoretical ones [2].

II-Experimental set-up and results.-For our new experiments a Nd:Yag pulsed laser has 

been used, the oscillator of which was Q-switched by a Pockels cell, followed by an 

amplifier. The laser beam was linearly polarised, monomode transverse, and almost 

longitudinally monomode, with 2 or 3 modes only, by using an intracavity FP glass disk. The 

laser pulse had a spectral width of 0.08 cm-1, and its duration was equal to 15 ns. Besides, the 

laser power at  l =1.064 m m was equal to a maximum of 30 MW, reduced to 10 MW at l

=532 nm by frequency-doubling, and the laser working was effected at the repetition rate of 

10Hz..

2=focusing lens; 3=high pressure cell;4=silicon

6=polyethylene rod of 20 cm length; 7=Cu mirror;
8=Ge:Au detector; 9=light detector for  triggering;
10=pulse analyser; 11=computer.

The experimental set-up is described on Fig.1: the laser beam was focused by means 

of a lens of 50 cm focal length in the high-pressure optical cell of 1m length and 2 cm inner 

diameter. At the end of the cell two filters were put to stop all visible and infrared radiations: 

one was a silicon disk of 5 mm thickness, the other a polyethylene rod of 20 cm length and of 

2 cm diameter, which was put in a Cu tube. The efficiency of this filter system had been 

checked by means of a InSb detector, cooled at liquid nitrogen temperature, the sensitivity of 

which was 100 times higher than that of the Ge:Au detector in the infrared region of 5 m m: 

no signal was detected during SRS in hydrogen. Behind the filter system a Cu mirror was set 

for reflecting the microwave   radiation to the Ge:Au detector. Finally, data were collected by 

means of a pulse analyser or a digital oscilloscope.

On Fig.2 is  displayed the signal observed with the Ge:Au detector  during a SRS 

experiment; it is strongly asymmetrical, with a short rise time estimated to 7 ns, the Stokes 

pulse duration being equal to 10 ns; the exponential decay of this signal has a characteristic 

time of 65 ns. Moreover, in the inset is shown a signal which is very similar to the previous 

one,   and   observed   in   experiments   carried   out   by   Manenkov   et   al.,   concerning   thermal 

breakdown of excitons by a microwave field; these particles were produced previously by 

3

laser excitation of free carriers in a pure germanium disk cooled at 1.3 K, followed by a 

binding process [3]. In addition, Keldysh et al. had improved their experiments, and had 

obtained for the rise and fall-off times of the breakdown pulses the values  of 100 and 200 ns, 

respectively   [4].   Accordingly,   we   think   that   in   our   SRS   experiments   with   hydrogen   a 

coherent emission of microwave pulses was also detected, because the sensitivity of our 

detector to microwave radiation might be due to the fact that under the influence of the 

polarisation   field,   induced   by   a   dc   40   V   voltage,   an   equilibrium   between   free   carriers, 

excitons and / or exciton complexes might  appear in the Ge:Au disk, cooled at 77 K. After 

that, the heating of free carriers by the assumed microwave radiation would be the cause of 

the exciton breakdown, giving rise to the increasing part of the signal, whereas its decreasing 

part should correspond to the characteristic time of  exciton recombination.

means of the Ge:Au detector, and due to the

[3] (see the text).

Besides,   experiments   had   been   performed   to   study   the   microwave   intensity   as   a 

function   of   the   gas   pressure.   On   Fig.3   is   shown   this   dependence,   in   the   case   of   a   SRS 

experiment with excitation by the 1.064 m m laser beam, while in the inset this dependence is 

depicted for a shorter region of the gas pressure, when the SRS experiment was performed by 

means of a 532 nm laser excitation. It can be seen that the microwave intensity is strongly 

increasing in the very low pressure range. Afterwards, a maximum appears in the 8-10 bar 

region, followed by an exponential decreasing up to about 20 bar; at higher pressure the signal 

intensity is  nearly constant. Moreover,  the exponential  behaviour  of  the decreasing part  is 

confirmed   on   Fig.4,   where   the   neperian   logarithm   of   the   signal   intensity   follows   a   linear 

variation with the number density of hydrogen.

In addition, the microwave intensity, measured at  the pressure of about 10 bar and 

with the 532 nm laser excitation of the signal, follows a linear variation with the product of 

the laser and Stokes beam powers, as shown on Fig.5. This linear relationship should point 

out   that   the   process   of   coherent   microwave   emission   in   hydrogen   should   be   due   to   a 

nonlinear optical phenomenon, like a parametric amplification.

Moreover, on Fig.6 the evolution of the normalized intensity of the microwave signal 

is shown as a function of the distance between the detector, set at 1m from the end of the 

high pressure cell, and the propagation axis of the laser beam. One can see that the signal 

may be detected during a large displacement of the detector, and that its profile is modulated, 

probably by diffraction effects.

On the other hand, we had determined the wavelength of the microwave radiation by 

using   a   home-made   wavemeter,   with   which   a   wavelength   of   about   1.4   cm   had   been 

measured,   corresponding   to   a   frequency   of   20   GHz.   Moreover,   we   had   attempted   to 

determine the microwave power by means of a detector manufactured by Spacek Labs. Inc. 

5

(model DK-2); the sensivity of this detector was 2.5 V/mW in the K band (18 to 26 GHz). An 

average of 6 nW had been obtained, which corresponds for the peak power to an order of 

magnitude of 10 µW. However, this power is not the true value emitted during the SRS 

process, because different effects are not taken into account during the propagation of the 

microwave emission, as reflections, absorptions, diffractions and scatterings.

 

Finally, during a recent SRS experiment with hydrogen , we have been able to detect 

a backscattered microwave radiation, the maximum intensity of which has been found to be 

at the same pressure of about 10 bar, as in the case of forward scattering.

III-Theory.-First of all, we propose for the slope vo of the linear relationship depicted 

on Fig.4, the value of which  is equal to 6.62 10-21 cm3, the following physical meaning: this 

parameter   should   correspond   to   the   volume   of   a   quasiparticle,   being   composed   of   a 

characteristic number of molecules vibrationally excited during the SRS process. An order of 

magnitude of this number  can be calculated by means of the model used by Hirschfelder et 

al. for a gas, the face-centered cubic lattice gas [5]: at low density the free volume occupied 

by one  molecule is given by v=3.18  s

3, where  s

  is the hard  sphere diameter  of  the  H2 

molecule, equal to 0.287 nm in the case of a Lennard-Jones potential. By comparing the 

volume v, equal to 7.52 10-23 cm3 to the volume vo of the quasiparticle, an order of magnitude 

of   about   one   hundred   of   vibrationally   excited   oscillators   is   found   to   make   up   one 

quasiparticle. Our hypothesis might be corroborated by the following points: owing to the 

excitation by the coherent laser beam, the vibrationally excited oscillators are all  in the same 

phase, and may interact strongly between them, through their anharmonicity. Moreover, if 

the density of these interacting particles becomes appreciable, what is the case for the Stokes 

wave intensity above the SRS threshold in the present instance, a cooperative effect should 

be present, leading to   a kind of “localisation” for the excited oscillators, according to the 

model developed by Kindall et al. for the case of anharmonic solids [6]. In other respects, let 

us note that Boling et al. had used a model based on the anharmonic oscillator to predict 

nonlinear   refractive   index   changes   in   optical   solids,   and   had   obtained   a   rather   good 

agreement between experimental data and their empirical relationships [7].  

On the other hand, we assume that the quasiparticle system is an intermediate state 

which should have a very short lifetime t R, of about 10-13-10-12s, compared to the laser pulse 

duration.   Besides,   we   admit   that   the   main   interaction   between   these   quasiparticles   is   of 

coulombian type, yielding a macroscopic electric field, longitudinally polarised. Moreover, it 

is assumed that the stationary wave associated to the quasiparticle system is modulated at the 

6

angular frequency w R of the quasiparticle vibration, which should be very close to the angular 

frequency w

v of the isolated molecular vibration, but slightly higher than the latter. 

Furthermore, another important hypothesis should be assumed: the quasiparticles are 

distorded by the electrostriction effect due to the laser field, what gives infrared active their 

vibrational mode, together with the advent of an induced dipole moment and an anomalous 

dispersion of the refractive index at the frequency w R ; another effect of this distortion leads 

to the lack of the centre of inversion for the quasiparticle system, which gets a “piezoelectric” 

character [8]. 

Afterwards, we will study the interaction between the dielectric medium and the laser 

light, by assuming that the wave associated to the quasiparticle system, and being stationary 

compared to the velocity of light in the medium, may be split into two progressive waves, 

propagating the one to forward, the other to backward, with a phase velocity very close to the 

light velocity in vacuum c, but higher than the light velocity in the dielectric medium. Thus, 

the stimulated processes, like Stokes and microwave emissions,  should be distinguished by a 

Cherenkov-type effect [9].

          We assume also that the “piezoelectric” character of the quasiparticle system can be 

depicted by two parameters, induced by the laser field: one is 

R

ind.C , which denotes the atomic 

displacement,   whereas   the   other   is  

E

ind.C ,which   is   an   electro-optic   coefficient.   These 

parameters are tensors of third rank, and can give rise to a nonlinear coupling of anharmonic 

origin, between light and matter waves, as shown by Merten et al. in the case of piezoelectric 

cubic solids [10-13]. In our case, we propose that the coupled mode photon-quasiparticle 

might   be   so-called   “anharmonic   longitudinal   polariton”   [12].   Furthermore,   taking   into 

account   only   the   coupling   with   the   Stokes   wave   in   the   parametric   approximation,   and 

writing: 1) Rz for the longitudinal component of the normal coordinate R of a quasiparticle, 

the   z   axis   being   the   laser   and   Stokes   wave   propagation   axis;   2)   Pz  for   the   longitudinal 

component of the polarisation density, associated to the quasiparticle waves; 3) (

S

xP )* for the 

transverse component of the complex conjugate of the polarisation density associated to the 

Stokes wave, the x axis being the direction of polarisation for the laser and Stokes waves, we 

are able to obtain the three following equations, according to ref. [10-13]:

In these equations the wave damping and the dispersion of the refractive index are 

neglected, excepting the anomalous dispersion at the frequency  w R; the parameter B is the 

coefficient of the mechanical-electric linear coupling, and is a scalar which we assume to be 

a function of the anharmonicity of the quasiparticle vibration; Ez is the longitudinal electric 

field, 

L

xE and 

S

xE are the electric fields of the laser and Stokes waves, respectively; finally, nL

According to ref.[10-13], the imaginary parts of these relations should correspond to an 

exponential   amplification   for   the   two   progressive   waves   associated   to   the     quasiparticle 

system, one to forward and the other to backward.

Moreover, from equations (3a) and (5) it is possible to obtain the following

It is interesting to note that this longitudinal field induces a  polarisation  Pz, to which two 

progressive waves may be associated, with the same phase velocity as assumed above. On 

the other hand, it can be  seen that a part of these longitudinal polarisation waves are in phase 

quadrature, and are mainly proportional to the imaginary part of the electro-optic coefficient

Consequently,   we   assume   that   this   transverse   part   of   these   longitudinal 

polarisation waves should be the origin of the coherent microwave radiation, observed in our 

SRS experiments with weakly compressed hydrogen. 

Besides, these two progressive polarisation waves should have theoretically an 

infinite wavelength, but on the physical point of view, this wavelength must be finite and 

very large compared to the light wavelengths. This is obtained by taking into account of an 

anomalous relativistic Doppler effect in a dielectric medium, as proposed in ref. [9]. Then, 

the angular frequency  w

o  of the microwave emission is related to the frequency  w R  by the 

following equation

o = (1-

 b 2)1/2 w R        (8)                   

where  b

  is the ratio between the phase velocity Vo  of the polarisation waves and c; this 

parameter must be very close from the unity value in our model, what is effectively  obtained 

in  the relation  given  below

Furthermore, the microwave radiation, which is assumed to be of Cherenkov-

type, should be emitted inside the Cherenkov cone, simultaneously with the SRS process, at 

least   to   all   appearances,   as   predicted   by   Ginzburg   et   al.   in   their   theory   [14-15];   our 

experimental results, shown in Fig.6, seem to agree with their assumption.

Finally,   concerning   the   exponential   decreasing   of   the   microwave   signal 

beyond the pressure of 8-10 bar, it is possible to explain this behaviour by assuming that the 

quasiparticle density is strongly reduced by the increasing effects of dephasing and non-

radiative relaxation of the vibrational energy, due to the Van der Waals forces. As a matter of 

fact, in the pressure range of 3-10 bar the collisional narrowing is the main effect [16], and 

the intensities  of   the  stimulated Raman  waves  and  of  the microwave  emission,  are  both 

strongly increasing. However, around the pressure of  8-10 bar the influence of the Van der 

Waals forces becomes sensitive, because the value of the collision rate W

 is equal to about 

the   reciprocal   of   the   average   of   the   quasiparticle   lifetime  t R,   which   corresponds   to   the 

relation W

t R  » 1; but at higher pressure this equality must be replaced by the inequality W

R>1, which shows that the Van der Waals forces are preponderating.

IV-Discussion.-First of all, it seems to us that our model might be drawn to the 

one developed by Dumartin, who had attempted to interpret his experimental results about 

the process of Stokes absorption, observed in several liquids during experiments of SRS 

associated with a broad spectral continuum, when the laser intensity is slightly above the 

SRS threshold [17-18]. For instance, Fig.7 displays the spectrum of the Stokes absorption 

band of liquid benzene, the bandwidth of which is one order of magnitude larger than the 

width of the Stokes emission line in spontaneous Raman scattering. To explain this process, 

Dumartin had shown that near the SRS threshold, the population of vibrationally excited 

molecules might be sufficiently high during very short times (10- 12-10- 11 s), compared to the 

duration of the laser pulse, to assume the existence of  a “population inversion”, giving rise to 

very broad Stokes absorption bands [18].

                                                                                 emission inside the strong absorption band.

                                                                                  

On the other hand, a comparison might be made between our   results about a 

coherent microwave emission by SRS in hydrogen , and observations of forward conical 

emissions in barium or sodium dense vapours illuminated by dye lasers at a slightly shorter 

wavelength than those of the resonance transitions; these emissions are picked at a longer 

wavelength, with same shifts from the resonance transitions, as those used for their excitation 

[19-22]. As a matter of fact, these last phenomena have been interpreted as Cherenkov-type 

processes, the origin of  the conical emissions being at the surface of self-focusing filaments 

[20-22]. However, in our case we propose also to take into account of a Cherenkov-type 

process, but the microwave radiation must be emitted in volume and inside the Cherenkov 

cone (see Fig.5), without self-focusing and filaments in hydrogen. Moreover, Golub et al. 

have calculated   the refractive indices at different detunings to the red of   the resonance 

transition, and have found that these parameters show anomalous dispersion profiles; they 

have also calculated the half- angles of the Cherenkov cones, given by the ratio n L/nC  where 

nC is the maximum of the anomalous profile, and have observed a good agreement with the 

experimental values [21]. On the other hand, in our case we assume that the half- angle of the 

Cherenkov cone is given by the ratio 1/nR, since the process of microwave emission takes 

place exactly at the resonance  frequency  w R.    

11

Besides, we think that our model might be drawn somewhat to the interpretation 

proposed by Le Quéau et al. for explaining observations of a coherent auroral kilometric 

radiation [23-24]. As a matter of fact, these authors have proposed a model based on the 

maser synchrotron instability, as follows: they assume that electron beams arising from the 

solar wind are weakly accelerated to several keV by an electric field, in a region of the 

magnetosphere where this field is parallel to the terrestrial magnetic field force lines, and 

have a spiral motion around the magnetic field lines. Therefore, if the electron distribution 

function  has  a  positive slope  between two  values  of  the perpendicular   electron  velocity, 

which should correspond to a “population inversion” having a short lifetime of about 1 ms, 

an   energy   exchange   between   particle   and   wave   is   possible,   showing   a   peak   when   the 

following resonance condition is fulfilled:

w X = (1-

 V2/c2)1/2 w

c

where V is the total electron velocity,  w X  the angular frequency of the coherent kilometric 

radiation and w

c the cyclotron frequency of electrons.

 As can be seen, there are several similarities between this last model and our 

own; however, one of the main differences is due to the fact that in the former the Doppler 

effect is weakly relativistic, while in our model it is necessary to take into account of an 

ultrarelativistic Doppler effect.

Finally,   let   us   note   that   recently   it   has   been   possible   to   obtain   coherent 

radiations of GW power in the far ultraviolet region, owing to a high-gain free electron laser 

working in a single pass [25-27]. In this device the linear electron beam, emitted as short 

bunches of ps duration, is accelerated to a velocity V’, very close to c, and forced to oscillate 

in the undulator made up of a periodic sequence of  alternating transverse magnetic fields. 

Then, the resonance wavelength  l ph  of the light emission is proportional to the quantity (l

u/2)[1-(V’/c)2],   where  l u  is   the   period   length   between   the   permanent   magnets   of   the 

undulator. For instance, in the last experiments, radiation at 32 nm wavelength has been 

observed,   the   light   pulses   having   a   duration   of   about   25   fs,   while   the   electron   bunch 

contained a 50 fs long leading spike [27].

Moreover, it is interesting to note that the “normalized emittance” of this free 

electron laser is proportional to the relativistic factor (V’/c)[1-(V’/c)2]-1/2, as given in ref.[27]; 

we   feel   that   this   parameter   might     be   somewhat   equivalent   to   the   one   used   below   for 

explaining the physical meaning of the third term in the relation (9), once multiplied by the 

relativistic factor b 2(1-b 2) –1/2.

V-Remarks about the SRS gain.-It is well known, when there is a jump at the 

SRS threshold in a dielectric medium, that the experimental values of the Raman gain for the 

Stokes wave are very much higher than those calculated by means of  the classical SRS 

theories [28]. These disagreements were explained by many authors, by taking onto account 

only the process of self-focusing due to the variation of the refractive index at high laser 

intensity, giving rise to a strong increasing of the laser electric field [29].

 

Nevertheless, it seems to us that an additional contribution might be also taken 

into account, which should be the origin of an enhancement of the Raman gain. As a matter 

of   fact,   we   can   calculate   the   polarisation   density   at   the   Stokes   frequency,   given   by   the 

relation (1c), by taking into account the relations (1a), (5) and (6). For obtaining the total 

polarisation density, we must add also to this computation, the imaginary part of the third 

order susceptibility at the Raman frequency (fourth term in the relation (9)), which is the 

origin of the exponential gain for the Stokes wave in the classical SRS theories, based only 

on the approximation of the steady state. Then, the following relation is obtained:

In   this   expression   the   first   term   denotes   the   linear   part   of   the   Stokes 

polarisation, which is the source of spontaneous Raman scattering. The second term is a 

nonlinear part, which depends on the square of the induced electro-optic coefficient, and 

might be an additional contribution to the amplification of the Stokes wave, effective only for 

very short times, e.g. during parametric instabilities of about  10-13-10-12 s. Finally, the third 

term is a in phase quadrature part of the polarisation, and should be a longitudinal component 

corresponding,  once   multiplied   by   the    relativistic        factor 
b 2(1-

b 2)-1/2  ,   to   the   translation   energy   of   the   whole   medium,   which   must   cancel   during 

instability   durations,   the   momentum   associated   to   the   progressive   quasiparticle   waves, 

according   to   the   theoretical   discussions   submitted   by   de   Broglie   about   some   relativistic 

formulas [30].

Conclusion.-In   this   paper   experimental   results   are   presented,   concerning 

observations for the first time, to our knowledge, of a coherent microwave radiation during 

SRS   experiments   in   weakly   compressed   hydrogen,   concomitant   with   the   emission   of 

stimulated Raman lines. The intensity of this microwave radiation had been studied as a 

function of the gas pressure, the laser and Stokes beam powers, and the distance between 

detector and propagation axis of the laser beam. Moreover, an estimate of the wavelength had 

been obtained, the value of which is of  the centimetric order of magnitude; an estimate of the 

peak power  of this microwave emission had been also determined to be in the order  of 

magnitude of 0.1-1 mW.

   An attempt to interpret the origin of this coherent microwave is proposed, on 

the basis of a phenomenological model, taking into account of an intermediate quasiparticle 

state, due to the influence of the vibrational anharmonicity of hydrogen molecules, when the 

density of vibrationally excited oscillators is high. Besides, we assume that the duration of 

this intermediate state should be very short (10-13-10-12 s).

 

On the other hand, it is stated that the electro- mechanical action of  the  laser 

light on the quasiparticle system gives rise to a “piezoelectric” character for this system; in 

addition, a nonlinear coupling of anharmonic type between the Stokes wave and the two 

progressive waves associated to the quasiparticle system is taken into account, together with 

the existence of  a macroscopic longitudinal  electric  field. Then, the quasiparticle system 

might   be called an “anharmonic longitudinal polariton” system. A Cherenkov-type effect 

and an anomalous relativistic Doppler effect are also taken into account.

Therefore, we assume that the source of the coherent microwave radiation is the 

in phase quadrature part of the longitudinal component of the polarisation waves, associated 

to the quasiparticle system . On the other hand, one can note that according to our model the 

microwave radiation should be emitted during very short times, like parametric instabilities 

which should appear as a continuous series, during  the time of propagation of the exciting 

laser beam  in the dielectric medium.

Concerning the SRS processes, recall that above the SRS threshold anomalous 

large   gains   had   been   observed,   which   had   been   explained   for   a   long   time,   only   by   the 

influence of self-focusing processes. However, it seems to us that it is necessary also to take 

14

into   account   of   an   additional   contribution   arising   from   the   influence   of   the   nonlinear 

coupling cited above, together with a cooperative effect.

Finally, let us mention that in the case of spontaneous Raman scattering with 

crystals, observations of new Raman lines over the normal number of lines related to crystal 

symmetries, and of enhanced Raman scattering, have been correctly interpreted for the first 

time by Poulet [31]. This author had shown that  in the case of  piezoelectric cubic  solids, 

these   two   effects   can   be   accounted   for,   in   the   case   of   the   first   one   by   the   action   of   a 

longitudinal   electric   field   induced   by   the   exciting   light   beam,   and   of   the   second   by   the 

influence   of   the   whole   medium   due   to   a   linear   electro-optic   coefficient,   related   to   this 

longitudinal electric field [31]. In other respects, Burstein et al. had   been able to interpret 

experimental results in the semiconductor GaAs, on the basis of the k» 0 coupled plasmon-

(LO)   longitudinal-optical–phonon   collective   modes   [32].   Furthermore,   Birman   et   al.   had 

propounded a theoretical explanation for the effect of enhanced Raman scattering in crystals, 

by   using   the   exciton   representation   as   intermediate   state;   they   have   shown   that   “for 

longitudinal polar optic vibration, there is an additional contribution to the Raman tensor due 

to the associated electric field” [33].

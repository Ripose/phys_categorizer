     It  is  shown  that  discrepancies  in  the  experimental  values  of  the  gravitational  con-
stant  might  be  caused  by  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  gravitational  force  and 
inequality of the absolute temperatures of sample masses used in various gravitational 
experiments. 
Key words: gravitational constant, gravitational force, temperature. 
 
 
     It is known that some divergences in the absolute values of the gravitational constant  
obtained by various authors in various experiments considerably exceed the accuracy of 
measurements  [1-3].  Differencies  of  the  experimental  average  values  of  the  gravita-
tional  constant  G

)  recommended  by  CODATA,  and  it  is  usually  ex-
plained  by  the  effects  of  hypothetic  factors:  effect  of  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field,  time 
G  value, dependence of  G   on direction in space, and some others. The 
fluctuations of 
temperature dependence of gravity force examined in [4] explains the divergences in the 
experimental values of  G  by differences in the absolute temperatures of sample masses 
used in those experiments. According to [4,5], the temperature dependence of the gravi-
tational constant G , in the first approximation, might be presented as

     In materials of the papers devoted to measurements of the gravitational constant  G  
values only the stability of the interacting masses temperatures is usually shown but not 
its  absolute  value  [2,6].  The  variance  of  the  average  absolute  values  of  the  sample 
masses temperatures in the gravitational experiments carried out in different laboratories 
practically can not be avoided and might reach a few degrees. Other physical conditions 
of experiments on determination of the absolute value of  G  might also essentially dif-
fer – different materials, dimensions and form, temperatures of the sample bodies, etc. 
The numerical estimates given above show that comparatively small (units of degrees) 
differences  in  the  absolute  temperatures  of  sample  masses  in  different  experiments 
might be one of the imported causes of the experimental average values scattering of G  
which has been observed for a long time. 
     It  should  be  especially  noted  the  temperature dependence of the gravitational force 
[4,5]  does  not  contradict  to  the  known  facts  of  the  classical  mechanics.  Such  depend-
ence is of a great importance for the present problems of the high-precision metrology 
of  mass,  gravimetry,  as  well  as  the  astrophysics.  Experimental  investigations  of  the 
body  temperature  effects  on  the  force  of  the  gravitational  interaction  of  bodies  are  of 
current interest and expedient.

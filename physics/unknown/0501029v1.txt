Abstract 

It is difficult for us to measure the Booster ring impedance up to the GHz range due to the 

instrumentation limit.  Since the de-bunching process in the Linac to Booster transfer is 

determined by the complex impedance of the Booster ring, one can obtain an impedance 

model, which has the best match to the machine impedance, just by searching the optimal 

fit between the simulated and measured turn-by-turn resistive wall signal (RWS). 

Introduction 

The  complex  ring  impedance  of  Booster  is  the  major  factor,  which  determines  the  de-

bunching process of the 200-MHz micro-bunch (MB) in the Linac to Booster transfer.  It 

is important for us to develop a numerical tool, which can be used to simulate the turn-

by-turn  RWS  when  the  MB  is  de-bunching  in  the  DC-operated  Booster.    Here,  we 

assume that the time structure of the MB and the ring impedance are known.  Based upon 

these assumptions, the de-bunching process can be simulated and expressed via the turn-

by-turn RWS.  One can find the most suitable impedance model for Booster by searching 

the optimal fit between the simulated and measured turn-by-turn RWS. 

There are two major contributions from the ring impedance to the de-bunching process.  

First, the real part of the ring impedance makes a charged particle lose energy according 

to Ohm’s law.  Secondly, the complex angle of the impedance, which includes the space 

charge impedance, causes a phase shift to its corresponding current component.   

It  is  unavoidable  for  us  to  describe  a  charged  particle  in  the  frequency  domain 

instead  of  the  time  domain,  since  the  impedance  is  expressed  as  a  function  of

frequency.[1]  A charged particle in the 200-MHz MB with a gaussian distribution can be 

treated  as  a  probability  wave,  and  this  probability  wave  has  exactly  the  same  time 

structure with the MB, except the integration of the one-particle probability wave is set 

to  one  due  to  the  consideration  of  normalization.    The  one-particle  probability  wave  in 

the time domain is shown by eq.1.

Here, τ=5 ns is the period of the 200-MHz MB.  A charged particle can be expressed in 

the frequency domain by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of eq.1.   

The  transmission  line  model  is  used  for  the  calculation  of  the  ring  impedance  from  96 

magnets  in  Booster.[2]    The  impedance  R  /  L  circuit  with  37  kΩ  /  40  µH  matches  the 

imaginary impedance, as shown by eq.2(a).

Since I(f) is the FFT of the probability wave i(t)of a charged particle, the unit of ∆E(f) is 

eV.  The phase shift per Booster turn (∆φe(f)), which is caused by the revolution-period 

change because of ∆E(f), is calculated using eq.3(b).[4]

Here, the phase slip factor η at the injection is 0.458, the kinetic energy E0 is 4×108 eV, 
the revolution period T0 is 2.22×10-6 s, T(f)=1/f is the period of the angular frequency f.   

The  phase  shift  per  Booster  turn  (∆φc(f)),  which  is  caused  by  the  complex  angle  of  the 

impedance, is calculated using eq.3(c).

The  total  phase  change  per  Booster  turn  (∆φ(f))  by  a  charged  particle  at  the  current

Since the 200-MHz MB de-bunches within tens of microseconds, the amplitude for each 

frequency  component  of  the  charged-particle  probability  wave  can  be  treated  as  a 

constant.    Till  now,  we  can  calculate  the  turn-by-turn  data  for  all  the  frequency 

components of a charged particle probability wave, and their inverse FFT gives the turn-

by-turn RWS. 

Simulation and Results 

The cutoff frequency (fc) was chosen to be 3.2 GHz.[5]  A simple impedance model,[5] 

as shown in eq.4, is used in our calculation.

The first simulation was done at the situation of σ=0.02 ns in eq.1.[6]  The MB is injected 

at  turn  #0,  as  shown  in  Fig.  1(a).    The  energy  loss  per  Booster  turn  due  to  the  real 

impedance is shown in Fig. 1(b).  In Fig. 1(c), phase shifts due to the real impedance, the 

complex angle, and the total phase shift per Booster turn are shown as the red, black, and 

blue curves separately.  The RWS of the bunch center is shown at turns #1, #2, #3, #5, 

and #10 by Figs. 1(d)-(h) separately.   

Another simulation was done at σ=0.2 ns.  The MB is injected at turn #0, as shown in 

Fig. 2(a).  The energy loss per Booster turn due to the real impedance is shown in Fig. 

2(b).  In Fig. 2(c), phase shifts due to the real impedance, the complex angle, and the total 

phase shift per Booster turn are shown as the red, black, and blue curves separately.  The 

RWS  of  the  bunch  center  is  shown  at  turns  #1,  #2,  #3,  #5,  and  #10  by  Figs.  2(d)-(h) 

separately.   

 

Comment 

In  the  above  calculation,  the  momentum  of  the  MB  in  Booster  is  treated  as  a  constant.  

The  contribution  to  the  de-bunching  of  the  MB  from  its  momentum  spread  should  be 

included in the future model.  Also, the cutoff frequency and the impedance model used 

in the calculation are borrowed from the recycler in Fermilab.  Booster might have a quite 

different  situation.    In  the  future,  the  attempt  of  matching  the  simulation  with  the 

measurement  could  be  an  important  method  for  making  correct  choices  of  the  cutoff 

frequency  and  impedance  model  for  Booster,  etc.    Furthermore,  the  impedance  from 

Booster  RF  cavities  should  be  considered  in  the  future  calculation  for  the  purpose  of 

making the model more close to the machine condition.  Finally, the program was made 

using  MATLAB  with  its  built-in  functions,  such  as  FFT  and  IFFT,  and  more  efforts 

should be investigated in the future program for a better accuracy.

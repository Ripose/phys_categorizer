ABSTRACT 

Magnetic  braking  is  a  long-established  application  of  Lenz’s  law.  A  rigorous 

analysis of the laws governing this problem involves solving Maxwell’s  equations in a 

time-dependent situation. Approximate models have been developed to describe different 

experiences related to this phenomenon. In this paper we present a new method for the 

analysis of the magnetic braking using a magnet fixed to the glider of an air track. The 

forces  acting  on  the  glider,  a  result  of  the  eddy  currents,  can  be  easily  observed  and 

measured.  As  a  consequence  of  the  air  track  inclination,  the  glider  accelerates  at  the 

beginning,  although  it  asymptotically  tends  towards  a  uniform  rectilinear  movement 

characterized  by  a  terminal  speed.  This  speed  depends  on  the  interaction  between  the 

magnetic field and the conductivity properties of the air track. Compared with previous 

related approaches, in our experimental setup the magnet fixed to the glider produces a 

magnetic braking force which acts continuously, rather than over a short period of time. 

The experimental results satisfactorily concur with the theoretical models adapted to this 

configuration.

I. INTRODUCTION 

When a conductor material is under the effect of a changing magnetic flux, eddy 

currents  are  induced  in  the  conductor.  This  change  in  the  flux  can  be  produced  either 

because the conductor is moving in a region where there is a magnetic flux or, similarly, 

because the magnet is moving. The action of the magnetic field on the induced currents 

produces a braking force. A rigorous analysis of the laws governing the problem entails 

the solving of the Maxwell equations in a time-dependent situation. This depends on the 

problem geometry and it is usually difficult to solve.  

Widerick et al.1 present a very simple model for the calculation of the magnetic 

drag  force  on  a  moving  metal  disc  in  the  air  gap  between  the  rectangular-shaped  pole 

pieces of an electromagnet. Likewise, Cadwell2 analyzes the effect of magnetic damping 

on an aluminium plate moving on a horizontal air track as it passes between the poles of a 

horseshoe magnet. In both cases, it is assumed that the induced current in the “shadow” 

of the magnet is uniform and equal to 

J

(
×σ=

Bv

)

. Both papers present a simple model 

and  fail  when  trying  to  explain  the  influence  of  the  magnet  size  or  its  position  with 

respect to the motion direction. Heald3 replaces the simplification of considering the eddy 

current density as a constant with a more realistic approach which also takes into account 

the contribution of the electric field generated by the charge separation: 

J

σ=

(

BvE
×+

)

. 

If we select the reference system in such a way that OX is the direction of the motion, 

then the Coulomb sources of E are the surface charges, within the conducting sheet, on 

planes  perpendicular  to  the  OX  axis.  Therefore  the  magnetic  braking  force depends on 

the  aspect  ratio,  A=Length/width,  of  the  magnet  footprint.  Marcuso  et  al.4,5  apply  a 

method  of  successive  approximations  to  solve  the  Maxwell  equations,  in  the  case  of  a 

 

2

conducting  disk  rotating  in  the  externally  applied  non-uniform  magnetic  field.  The 

experimental results satisfactorily concur with the theory except for the area near the disk 

border.  Aguirregabiria  et  al.6  study  the  same  problem  in  a  quasi-static  approximation, 

emphasizing the role played by the charge distributions induced in the disk. In this paper, 

cases of both infinite and finite radii are considered in order to analyse the border effects. 

Similarly, Lee and Park7,8 present the model and experimental results for a rotating disk 

with a rectangular-shaped electromagnet. They consider the boundary conditions of the 

rotating disk by using the mapping and image method techniques. Salzman et al.9, in a 

pedagogical manner, reveal the solution to the problem of a very large plane conducting 

sheet  passing  between  circular  magnet  poles.  They  emphasize  the  importance  of 

considering  the  induced  electric  field,  as  is  pointed  out  by  Gauthier10.  Related  studies 

concerning  damping  forces  due  to  eddy  currents  on  oscillating  systems11,12,  or  those 

forces  present  when  a  magnet  moves  through  a  pipe13,14  ,  serve  to  illustrate  different 

aspects of the same main problem. In all the cited papers the conductor passes between 

the poles of a fixed magnet. Subsequently, the effects can only be measured over a short 

period of time which can be repeated periodically in the case where the conductor is a 

rotating disk.  

In this paper we present a new experimental setup where the magnet is fixed to a 

glider  sliding  on  an  air  track.  From  the  physical  point  of  view,  the  movement  of  the 

magnet close to a resting conductor is equivalent to the movement of the conductor close 

to  a  fixed  magnet.  The  materials  needed  (air  track,  glider,  magnet...)  are  commonplace 

laboratory materials for first year undergraduate Physics courses. With this configuration, 

the magnetic damping force does not only act over a short period of time, but also acts 

 

3

continuously during the whole movement. Moreover, the influence of the aspect ratio of 

the rectangular magnet footprint can be easily analysed by rotating the magnet orientation 

on the glider. However, the one drawback of this device is that the magnetic field is not 

uniform and this makes the theoretical problem more complicated.  

In  previous  studies,  experimental  results  have  been  achieved  using  different 

methods:  a  commercial  Pasco  motion  sensor1,2,  a  photoresistor  connected  to  a 

microcomputer5,  by  taking  measurements  of  the  braking  torque  through  reading  the 

output voltage of the load cell7,8. Another method has been to use an oscilloscope14 and 

computer  to  record  the  voltage  pulse11-13.  We  propose  to  take  measurements  of  the 

position as a function of time by means of digital image capture which has proved to be 

an  effective  method15,16,17.  This  method  can  be  automated  by  using  image  recognition 

techniques18,19.  We  used  standard  linear  correlation20  as  a  basis  for  the  detection 

technique. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical motion equations 

solved by applying the theoretical model. Furthermore, the experimental setup has been 

designed to show the relevance of the induced electric field. 

 

 

II. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS  

According to Faraday’s law, when a magnet fixed to the glider is moving on an 

air  track,  the  changing  magnetic  flux  through  the  aluminium  track  produces  an 

electromotive force equal to the time rate of change in the magnetic flux given by

Figure 1 shows the experimental design. In an initial approximation it can be considered 

that  the  magnetic  field  is  perpendicular  to  the  conducting  plane:

B

ˆB=
z

.  The  reference 

system  moves  with  the  glider,  so  that  the magnet is at rest and the electromotive force 

produces a current density inside the conducting air track that is represented by 

J

σ=

(

BvE

)

, 

(2) 

where  σ  is  the  conductivity  of  the  air  track  material,  E  is  the  electrostatic  field  of 

Coulomb charge induced within the conductor, 

v

ˆv=
x

 is the velocity of the conducting 

sheet relative to the glider, and B is the magnetic field measured at rest. Some authors1,2 

only consider the second term of Eq. (2). However, the magnitude of the first term can be 

as  large  as  the  second  one  and,  since  these  take  opposite  directions,  the  net  current 

density could even be zero. This would occur in the  limit case of a very long and thin 

magnet (as applied to the motion direction).  

From the microscopic point of view21, the magnetic field, acting on the moving 

charges  of  the  conductor  produces  a  force 

F

=

(q

Bv
×

)

  in  these.  This  force  causes  the 

charges of different signs to separate. This separation of charges will produce an electric 

field  pointing  upward  that  will  tend  to  decrease  the  total  force  on  the  given  charge 

 

 

5

moving in the conductor material (see Fig. 2). As can be seen in Fig. 3, the magnetic field 

in  the  shadow  region  is  not  uniform.  As  such,  the  exact  solution  would  be  arrived  at 

through solving the Maxwell equations. However, the calculation of the electric field can 

be simplified when taking a uniform magnetic field Bavg, which is the average magnetic 

field obtained from the experimental data measured at positions on a hypothetical three-

dimensional grid. To obtain this electric field, let us consider the surface charge density 

as the product of the polarization and the unit outward normal vector3,8

This  result  is  similar  to  that  obtained  by  Heald2.  However,  in  that  article  the 

conductor  is  a  rotating  disk,  but  they  consider  the  magnet  in  the  OY  axis  and  then  the 

velocity in the OX direction. On the other hand, Lee and Park7,8 take into account the size 

of the shadow magnet, and therefore the x and y components of the velocity, depending 

on the position. As a consequence they have four charged surfaces and the problem takes 

longer to solve, but not more complicated. 

We have numerically performed the integration given by Eq. (8). For each one of 

the points on the three-dimensional grid where we have measured the magnetic field B, 

we  have  also  calculated  the  function  f(A,x,y)  given  by  Eq.  (4a).  The  result  of  the 

integrand of Eq. (8) has been multiplied by the volume element, and then we have added 

all the terms obtained in this manner.

III. EXPERIMENT DESIGN 

To  validate  the  theoretical  expectations  we  have  measured  the  effect  of  the 

braking  force  on  the  movement  of  a  glider  that  has  a  magnet  fixed  to  it.  The  system 

glider-magnet moves on an inclined frictionless air track. Subsequently, the acceleration 

of the system depends on the tangential component of the weight and the braking force 

given by Eq. (7).  

The air track is a commercial PASCO Scientific® that has a length of 2 m, and is 

made of aluminium with a thickness of 3 mm (see Fig. 1). The electric conductivity is 3.1 

107  (Ωm)-1  (supplied  by  the  manufacturer).  The  glider  has  a  mass  of  190  g  and  the 

magnet is fixed to it in such a way that the magnetic field lines pass through the glider (2 

mm  thick)  and  arrive  at  the  conducting  sheet  in  a  perpendicular  manner.  The  air  track 

forms an angle of approximately 0.8º with the horizontal.  

The  commercial  magnet,  made  of  NdFeB,  has  a  parallelepipedic  shape  of 

dimensions  4×2×0.5  cm3  and  a  mass  of  25  g.  The  magnetic  poles  are  on  the  4x2  cm2 

surfaces.  The  resultant  magnetic  field  in  the  conducting  sheet  (the  air  track)  is  not 

homogeneous.  It  has  been  measured  by  means  of  a  gauss-meter  -  FW-Bell-4048  at  66 

points of the magnet shadow at 3 different planes parallel to the magnet surface, 22 points 

in  each  plane. These planes are  located at a distance of 2 mm from the magnet surface 

(this is the distance at which the outer surface of the air track is located), at 3.5 mm (in 

the middle of the air track) and, at 5 mm (the inner part of the air track). In Fig. 3, we can 

see a three dimensional representation of the magnetic field as it has been measured. The 

average magnetic field has been obtained through the expression

where τ is the total volume of the region of the conducting sheet, when some appreciable

The  measurements  of  the  glider  position  were  obtained  by  means  of  the  video-

analysis technique15-19. The digital camera used in the experiments was a Panasonic NV-

DS15EG, with an exposure time of 1/750 s and with a rate of 25 frames/s, providing a 

time  resolution  of  0.04  s.  The  camera  was  placed  with  its  axis  perpendicular  to  the 

movement direction, at a distance of 1.5 m. The video system was PAL (phase alternation 

 

10

by  line)  which  can  produce  720x576  pixel  images.  As  most  of  the  image  recognition 

techniques require the use of matrices, the dimensions of which are integer powers of 2, 

we have taken 512x512 pixel windows for the information analysis.  

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

In  order  to  test  our  theoretical  model,  we  have  performed  experimental 

measurements of the braking magnetic force by looking at its effect on the movement of 

the  glider.  Let  us  consider  the  glider  sliding  without  friction  on  an  inclined  plane  that 

makes an angle θ with the horizontal under the effect of the braking force given by Eq. 

(7). If we take the OX axis along the movement direction, the motion equation, given by

A=0.5  (vertical),  in  both  cases,  this  being  the  average  magnetic  field  B=66  mT.  The α 

parameter  allows  us  to  check  the  theoretical  model,  by  comparing  its  calculated  and 

experimental  fitted  results.  As  expected,  the  greater  A  is,  the  lower  the  value  for  the 

coefficient α . Consequently, a lower dumping of the movement is obtained.

In order to verify the importance of the electric field contribution to the drag force 

we have used a longer magnet with a footprint aspect ratio A=4. Figure 5 represents both 

the  experimental  and  the  fitted  results  together.  For  the  sake  of  comparison,  the 

corresponding results for A=2 are represented. In both cases the average magnetic field is 

B=78 mT. In this case, the shadow of the magnet is double the size of the other shadow 

represented.  However,  the  expected  values  for  the  dumping  coefficient  are  of  the  same 

order. This result is confirmed by the experiment.  

In Table I a summary of the most important parameters entailed in this experience 

can  be  observed.  The  experimental  parameters  αE  and  vT,  and  their  uncertainties,  were 

obtained  using  the  standard  least-squares  method.  The  comparison  between  the 

theoretical expectations and the experimental results allow us to state that the proposed 

theoretical model is a good match for this experience.

V. CONCLUSIONS. 

 

 

As we have seen, our experimental setup allows students to investigate magnetic 

damping  using  the  conventional  materials  found  in  laboratories  for  first  year 

undergraduate Physics courses. Compared with previous related approaches, in our case a 

magnet is fixed to a glider that slides on an air track, producing a magnetic braking force 

that acts continuously. The results satisfactorily concur with the theoretical predictions. 

Furthermore, the relevance of the electric field induced in the conductor is demonstrated. 

The present study sheds new light on several physics experiences. In Particular, we are 

currently designing a new electromagnetically-damped, coupled oscillator system using 

this methodology.

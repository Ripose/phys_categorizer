              Self-field and quantized magnetic-flux are employed to generate the quantum numbers 
           and  l of atomic physics.  Wave-particle duality is shown to be a natural outcome of having a

which is identical to Eq. (1).  Eq. (5) can be taken as the heart of self-field (or electromagnetic reaction1,2) physics. 
It is what is expected in the absence of external forces.  If Eqs. (4) are substituted into Eq. (5) and then integrated 
over time

               The self-field is extended in space (distributed throughout the spring).  Ignoring the possibility that the 
collapse process might introduce external fields, we see that the particle can not be captured until we also capture 
(i.e. collapse) the self-field  (spring motion). 
 

                                   SELF-FIELD FOR AN ELECTRON ORBIT

canonical momentum P given by3

with a persistent (superconducting) current.  This should not be surprising as a stable atomic orbit is certainly a

and differences between the state energies then gives the hydrogen spectra.  The procedure of including the 
particle(cid:146)s self-field, along with quantized flux, thus leads to the standard (observed) hydrogen spectra of atomic 
physics. 

Equation (14), upon identifying 

ϕπRn  as the (cid:147)wavelength(cid:148), can be seen to be a version of the

Here lack of a spot on a screen might be the result of the lack of a particle being present, rather than 

All particle (cid:147)interference(cid:148) experiments have at least one particle path being a non-straight line, thus the 

de Broglie relationship.  The version here is intimately connected to the presence of path curvature (while the 
conventional de Broglie relationship is claimed to be valid for a free particle).  Consequently there is a difference 
between conventional quantum mechanics and the self-field/quantized flux approach taken here. 
 
curvature form of Eq. (14) could represent the greater validity.  If so, then (cid:147)wave-particle(cid:148) duality might be 
ultimately understood in terms of a particle and its self-field. 
 
destructive interference between particle-waves.  An electron propagating from cathode to diffraction grating, and 
then to an anode screen, must have an electrical return path.  Thus there is an (are many) allowed closed path(s) 
which satisfy Eq. (13).

Is the Lorentz Transformation Distance-Dependent ?

Ernst Karl Kunst

An analysis of the Lorentz transformation shows that the unchangeability of the
space-time  coordinates  of  the  inertial  systems  under  consideration  and  the
possibility  of  a  direct  projection  of  those  coordinates  onto  another  are  the
underlying basic assumptions as to its unlimited validity. It is demonstrated that
from an empiric-physical point of view these assumptions are not given in the
case  of  inertial  systems  separated  by  very  large  distances.  Analogous  to  the
impossibility  to  measure  motion  relative  to  absolute  space,  it  turns  out  to  be
physically non feasible to extend the coordinate system of any reference frame
considered at rest relative to a distantly moving system for a direct comparison
of the coordinates, and vice versa. 
The extended Lorentz transformation strictly based on first physical principles
predicts  the  possibility  of  superluminal  propagation  of  very  distantly  moving
material bodies and, in this case, the generation of Cerenkov radiation out of the
quantum vacuum. For many astrophysical phenomena and their experimentally
verified properties this yields a novel view.

Key  Words:  Distance-dependence  of  the  Lorentz  transformation  -  far-range
transformation - superluminal velocity - vacuum Cerencov radiation

Introduction

In the last decades superluminal motions in extragalactic radio and optical sources on
the grounds of the validity of the Hubble-relation for cosmic distances, and recently
also in the Milky Way, have been discovered. Furthermore, astronomers have been
observing  intra  day  and  even  shorter  variability  in  luminosity  especially  in  lacertae
objects,  nuclei  of  galaxies,  quasars  and  jets  of  quasars  as  highly  energetic
phenomena.  The  most  widely  discussed  explanation  for  those  phenomena  are
astrophysical  "beaming  models"  or  "Doppler  boosting",  due  to  the  orientation  of  a
moving object toward the observer at a small angle to the line of sight, presuming the
Lorentz transformation and, therewith, special relativistic aberration to be valid over
huge cosmic distances relative to our vantage point on Earth [1].

In the following analysis of inertial motion is shown that the Lorentz transformation 
is distant-dependent with the most important result, superluminal motion of material
bodies in principle to be possible. Starting point of this reviewal is the validity of special
relativity at close range or negligable separation of the inertially moving systems under
consideration,  though  we  refer  to  that  theory  in  its  symmetric  form  [2],  which  we
recapitulate here in short. In the mentioned work on relativistic kinematics has been
shown  a  preferred  rest  frame  of  nature  (( )  in  any  inertial  motion  to  exist  and  any
velocity  (v )  to  be  symmetrically  composite  or  quantized.  From  this  a  symmetric
modification of the Lorentz transformation follows between a frame of reference S1
considered to be at rest according to the principle of relativity and a moving frame S2:

1. On very Distant Measures and Motions

As  a  physical  basis  in  special  relativity  and  also  in  its  symmetric  form  the  Lorentz
transformation  is  derivated  by  taking  the  dimensional  axes  of  the  systems  under
consideration always to coincide and to be parallel, or with other words: It is taken for
guaranted that the space-time coordinates of an event in the moving frame are directly
projectable onto the respective ones of the reference frame considered to be at rest
and vice versa [3]. The expression as laws in Minkowskian four-dimensional space-
time  [4]  or  its  formulation  as  index-calculus  (four-vector  calculus)  do  not  alter  the
underlying  physical  principle.  Thus,  any  statement  about  relative  motion  in  the

3

framework of relativistic kinematics basically implies velocity of a moving system or
body within or at very close range of the space-time coordinates of the frame of the
observer, considered resting. This implies that, empirically speaking, it is unjustified to
apply the transformation automatically on the kinematical relations between any two
bodies  of  reference,  which  are  separated  by  a  considerable  (e.  g.  interplanetary,
interstellar or cosmic) spatial distance, because this proceeding obviously requires the
space-time coordinates of the frame of reference based on the volume of the body “at
rest” to be continued to the "moving" body or volume of reference and vice versa. If we
try to extend the frame of reference far beyond the limits of the physical body resting
in its coordinate source, we leave secure physic-empirical experience. In the contrary,
we are forced to admit that a concrete elongation of the coordinate system “at rest” to
the moving one (and vice versa) cannot be physically realized. We only could generate
a new coordinate system near the “moving” one, very far though resting relative to the
original  system  at  rest.  Just  as  it  proves  impossible  to  measure  velocity  relative  to
Newtonian “absolute space”, a direct measurement of the dimensions and the velocity
of a very distantly moving body resting in the source of its inertial system relative to an
imaginary extension of the inertial frame at rest, turns out physically to be non feasible.
Instead, the very physical basis of statements about the parallel translational motion of
a distant object are solely measurements of light signals from that object in reference
to  an  unit  of  measure  of  the  own  volume  of  reference,  considered  to  be  at  rest  in
accord with the principle of relativity.

S  and S'  may be frames of reference with all coordinate axes parallel, which for the
transformation equations (1) are valid. Especially may S'  be in relative motion at close
range or within the rest frame of reference S  in the direction of the x-axis of the latter
system. Very distantly from both systems we introduce a system S*  in space, resting
relative to S  so that S(cid:9)  * (cid:9)S (cid:9)  ' (cid:9) » S (cid:9)  (cid:9)S(cid:9)  ' (cid:9),  also all coordinate axes being parallel to the axes
of S  and S'. The velocity of a light signal propagating through vacuum in the direction
of the x-axis of S' must be "c" for an observer resting in the latter system as well as in
the nearby system S . 1
Now let us turn toward the very distant system S* . For an observer, resting there, the
velocity  of  light  in  S'  will  appear  apparently  slowed  in  dependence  on  the  distance
S(cid:9)  * (cid:9)S (cid:9)  ' (cid:9) as well as the transversal motion of S' relative to S* .
Thus, the apparent or relative transversal velocity of S' and the velocity of light within
this system tend for an observer in S*  toward null if he is only sufficiently apart from S'.
2
Obviously the adjective "apparent" does not quite correspond to the facts because - as
already  stated  -  in  physical  reality  there  are  no  other  light  signals  available  for
measurements  of  measures  and  velocities  than  those  received  from  S'.  Any
statements  as  to  the  true  velocity  of  S'  and  the  true  velocity  of  light  in  that  system
prove meaningless for real measurements in the coordinate system S* . Besides the
relativity of inertial motion are dimensions, velocities and the velocity of light of distant
bodies  further relativated by the spatial distance between the inertial systems under
consideration.  These  shrinked  dimensions  and  retarded  motions  are  the  only
empirically  ascertainable  ones  and  must  therefore  considered  integral  part  of  the
principle of relativity. Thus, as the basic physical principles of relativistic kinematics of
bodies, moving very far away from each other and, therewith, of the transformation
equations, only four statements supported by physical experience exist:

1) Validity of the (symmetric) Lorentz transformation at negligable (nearly
zero) distance between the inertial systems under consideration;

2) Physical impossibility to extend the coordinates of the reference frame
“at rest” to a very distantly moving object and its coordinate system (and
vice  versa)  and  to  measure  dimensions  and  velocities  by  direct
comparison of coordinates;

3)  Apparent  decrease  of  the  velocity  of  distant  objects,  moving
transverse  to  the  line  of  sight  and  their  dimensions,  whereby  the
"apparent velocity" as well as the shrinkage of dimensions is a simple
function of the respective value at the imaginary distance null and the
distance  in  Minkowskian  space-time  between  the  bodies  under
consideration;

4)  Independence  of  the  dilation  of  time  of  moving  objects  of  their
distance  and  of  the  direction  of  the  vector  of  velocity  relative  to  the
observer considered to be at rest.

The  Lorentz  transformation  of  a  complete  kinematic  theory  must  be  in  accord  with
these first physical principles.

Distances

It is obvious that the distance R = S(cid:9)  * (cid:9)S (cid:9)  ' (cid:9), as observed from S* , must directly join to the
coordinate source (coincident with the center of gravity) of the latter system so that the
velocity of S' relative to S*  and the velocity of light at S' is slowed in accordance with
proposition 3) and that at the distance R (cid:25) 0 proposition 1) and, therewith, (1) becomes
fully valid. On the other hand the observer at S*  according to proposition 4) continues
to observe the lapse of time of S' being retarded. This also can be proven directly.
Considering a Feynmanian "light signal watch", resting relative to S', we find that the
distance factor R cancels out so that t'  = (cid:11) t* .
0 1
The (cid:11)-factor of the x-coordinate can be directly computed from (1), whereby we write
x  = x* , x°  = x° *, t  = t*  and t°  = t° *:

(2). By multiplying both equations (2), whereby according to (1a) and (1b) it is clear that

transformation - though in its symmetric form (1) - proves to be a border line case at
close range with mere "local" validity and it is obvious that (3) is the far-range form of

Evidently (8a) contradicts (8). This contradiction can obviously only be resolved if all
motions are related to a system at rest relative to space-time. Otherwise we would, as
(8a) shows, arrive at contradictory results. Hence (8) must in any case be true. This
implies that also in the far-range case the scalar

where  n((cid:7)',  1)  is  a  complex  number  in  the  complex  ct,  x-plane  of  symmetrically
modified  Minkowskian  space-time  [2].  The  twin-paradox  of  special  relativity  is
resolved  to  the  result  that  time  dilation  depends  on  motion  relative  to  space  time.
Hence clocks on the Earth (in the whole system of the sun), which moves at velocity
v  (cid:17) 600 km/s relative to space-time, should run slow (cid:17) 2 × 10  s, as compared with
0
a clock at rest relative to the latter. This effect implies that spacecraft on a direct track
to  the  outer  planets,  as  e.  g.  Jupiter,  should  arrive  there  minutes  earlier  in
dependence on the duration of the voyage.

4. Further Kinematic Consequences

We turn to the physical implications of (3) and its derivations (4) and (7). Evidently the
dilation of time in S'  is compensated for by the symmetric inertial velocity

of the latter system relative to S*  if both systems are far away from each other so that
observers, resting in the coordinate sources of either system, will meet after the same
amount of time has elapsed, as measured in their systems.
Possible effects of acceleration are neglected and it is understood that asymmetric
ageing should occur if S'  is accelerated, as proven by general relativity. Nevertheless,

1

in  the  far-range  case  any  velocity  even  exeeding  that  of  light  in  any  amount  is
possible,  allowing  in  principle  the  superluminal  propagation  of  solid  bodies  and
thereby transfer of information.  
Consider  ultra  relativistic  particles  or  photons  to  move  relative  to  the  very  distant
system S'  so that (3) is valid, according to the equations

wherefrom follows

(cid:10)(cid:10) tan (cid:20)(cid:12)2 .

Thus, no relativistic aberration or Doppler boosting is to observe by an observer at S* ,1
which implies that this special relativistic effect at close range is ruled out in the far-
range  case  (3)  as  an  explanation  of  superluminal  phenomana  on  and  in  cosmic
objects, especially jets.
It clearly follows that the principle of cause and effect is not impaired if V  > c.

for electrical non neutral particles moving through a material medium at superluminal
velocity v = (cid:7)c > c/n, where "n" means the refractive index of the medium and "(cid:5)" the
half angle of the cone of radiation [5], we have to expect an electromagnetic shock-
wave  phenomenon,  when  a  very  distant  material  body,  e.  g.  a  particle,  traverses
vacuo at the velocity V  = (cid:11) v  (cid:7) c. This results from the fact that the probability "p" to
encounter  virtual  photons  (or  elementary  dipoles)  for  a  particle  traversing  the
fluctuating quantum vacuum at subluminal symmetric velocity V  < c should according
to Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation (cid:12)E(cid:12)t (cid:7) h rise with growing velocity. To express
the uncertainty relation as a function of velocity we write

virtual photons to become real and stable for a moving particle if its far-range velocity

6. Evidence of Vacuum Cerenkov Radiation in High Energetic Astrophysical
Phenomena

From the foregoing is clear that in the far-range case relativistic beaming is excluded
as an explanation of the characteristics of jets and especially of the often observed
superluminal  motions  in  jets.  According  to  this  distance-dependent  extention  of
special  relativistic  kinematics  is  superluminal  motion  as  natural  as  any  sub-light
velocity.

It is predicted that most if not all non-thermal emission of cosmic objects is due to
vacuum Cerenkov radiation.
With the polarization of space (vacuum) by a superluminal particle and the radiation
of  photons  must  be  connected  a  continous  energy  (velocity)  loss  of  the  moving
particle, analogous to the stopping power owing to the density effect of the theory of
Cerencov radiation [5]. This effect naturally explains the variation in the continuum
emission of Active Galactic Nucleii (AGN) and jets, where years after fast outbursts in
the  optical  region  corresponding  events  at  radio  frequencies  are  found  [7].  High
energetic  particles  generating  optical  or  vacuum  Cerenkov  radiation  of  still  higher
frequencies, e. g. in a jet, would according to (14) travel at a velocity of (cid:17) 10  c and,
therewith, cover the whole length of the jet of some kpc in a couple of years, gradually
loosing energy and slowing down. Thus an intensity variation, e. g. due to a sudden
rise  of  the  particle  number  in  the  jet  stream,  would  first  occur  in  the  emission  of
highest  frequency  and  then  in  the  mentioned  time  wander  through  the  whole
frequency band down to the radio hot spot. The experimentally found strong variability
of  the  gamma-ray  luminosity  of  blazars  and  its  correlation  with  the  far-infrared
luminosity  of  the  latter  [8]  (also  in  other  AGN)  can  also  be  explained  by  sudden
variations of a particle flux streaming randomly off the blazar core at diferent highly
relativistic velocities. This picture is strongly supported by the HST view of a certain
class  of  radio  galaxies,  which  revealed  non-thermal  nuclear  sources  with  a  linear
correlation between the radio and optical luminosities [9].

The relativistic vacuum Cerenkov effect also explains in a fully way other observed
phenomena,  optical  and  otherwise,  on  and  in  jets  of  high  energetic  extragalactic
systems, especially the marked colour variation along jets from blue over red, near
infrared to radio wavelengths, as for instance in the elliptical galaxy M87 and even the
occurrence of X-ray emission, as in the jets of the quasar 3C 273 [10] and again M87
[11]. Furthermore,  the frequently observed onesidedness of the jet phenomenon in
the  frame  of  our  theory  can  be  easily  explained  by  two  counter  directed  ultra
relativistic jets with radiation cones according to (13) and (15), and the jet axes mildly
inclined against the line of sight. In this case the Cerenkov radiation from the farer jet
is always directed away from the observer to remain undetectable, except from stray
particles. This effect also explains the relative faintness of the counter jet of HH 30 in
the Milky Way [12].
Finally  most  recent  HST  observations  of  optical  jets  in  radio  galaxies  have  shown

definite examples of two-sided optical hotspots and jets [13], which clearly rule out
Doppler boosting, but are explained easily by vacuum Cerenkov radiation.

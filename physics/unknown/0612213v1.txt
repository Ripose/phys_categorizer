Abstract 

 
We propose an innovative linear accelerating structure, particularly suited for hadrontherapy 
applications. Its two main features are compactness and good power efficiency at low beam 
velocities:  the  first  is  achieved  through  a  high  working  frequency  and  a  consequent  high 
accelerating  gradient,  the  second  is  obtained  by  coupling  several  H-mode  cavities  together. 
The structure is called CLUSTER, which stands for “Coupled-cavity Linac USing Transverse 
Electric Radial field”. 
In order to compare the performance of this structure with other hadrontherapy linac designs 
involving  high  frequencies,  a  conceptual  study  has  been  performed  for  an  operating 
frequency  of  3 GHz.  Moreover  a  proof  of  principle  has  been  obtained  through  RF 
measurements on a prototype operating at 1 GHz. 
An  accelerator  complex  using  a  CLUSTER  linac  is  also  considered  for  protontherapy 
purposes. The whole complex is called cyclinac and is composed of a commercial cyclotron 
injecting the beam in a high-frequency linac. 
 
Keywords: cyclinac, linac, hadrontherapy, H-cavity, low-β structure, coupled structure.

1.  THE CYCLINAC APPROACH TO HADRONTHERAPY 

This paper describes a novel type of drift tube linac which is optimally suited to accelerate 
slow  nuclear  particles  (β ≤ 0.2)  with  high  field  gradients.  Since  the  structure  (named 
CLUSTER),  has  several  potential  applications,  in  the  rest  of  the  paper  no  particular  use  is 
described. However this first section is devoted to explain the framework in which the idea 
was born. 

In  modern  hadrontherapy,  solid  tumours  are  controlled  by  irradiating  them  with  beams  of 
charged hadrons, in particular protons and carbon ions [1]. The rationale of protontherapy is 
the dose depth distribution characterized by the Bragg peak allowing a dose delivery which 
spares healthy tissues much better than 10 MeV photons (X rays) [2]. Clinically protons have 
the same effect as X-rays, so that the knowledge accumulated with conventional therapy can 
be immediately transferred to this technique. A carbon ion leaves about twenty-four times the 
energy  in  each  cell  compared  to  a  proton  of  the  same  range  and  produces  qualitatively 
different effects. Indeed, carbon ion therapy targets successfully radio resistant tumours, i.e. 
the slowly growing tumours that are insensitive to both X-rays and protons [3, 4, 5]. 

In  2006,  hospital-based  centres  for  deep  protontherapy  are  treating  patients  in  the  United 
States (3), in Japan (4) and in China (1). Other hospital-based centres for protons are under 
construction in China, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, South Korea and United States. In 2007, 
two  other  European  centres  will  be  completed.  The  first,  called  HIT,  was  designed  by  GSI 
and  is  located  in  Heidelberg,  Germany,  the  second  one,  CNAO,  has  been  designed  by  the 
TERA  Foundation  and  is  currently  being  built  in  Pavia,  Italy.  Since  the  beginning  of  the 
century  hadrontherapy  is  developing  very  rapidly,  so  that  six  companies  offer  turn-key 
facilities,  which  are  based  on  either  synchrotrons  or  cyclotrons.  Only  in  the  last  few  years 
superconducting cyclotrons for carbon ion therapy have been designed [6]. 

As  an  alternative  to  cyclotrons  and  synchrotrons,  the  TERA  group  has  introduced  a  novel 
accelerator  system,  called  “cyclinac”,  which  is  composed  of  a  low  to  medium  energy 
cyclotron  and  a  high-frequency,  high-gradient  linac.  The  usual  beam  lines  and  gantries  are 
located  at  the  end  of  the  linac.  It  can  been  shown  that  the  time  and  intensity  structure  of  a 
cyclinac is better suited to the active dose distribution approach, called “spot scanning” and 
developed  at  PSI  [7]  than  those  produced  by  cyclotrons  and  synchrotrons.  A  cyclinac  is 
intended to be the heart of IDRA, the “Institute for Diagnostic and RAdiotherapy”, which is a 
multipurpose  facility  for  the  production  of  both  radiopharmaceuticals  for  diagnostic  and 
therapy, and high-energy protons for the radiotherapy of superficial and deep-seated tumours 
(Fig. 1). 

In IDRA one of the 30 MeV cyclotron beam lines injects protons in a linac booster (LIBO), 
which is a Side Coupled Linac (SCL) running at 3 GHz, the same frequency adopted by more 
than  8000  electron  linacs  used  in  the  world  for  conventional  radiotherapy.  The  idea  of  the 
cyclinac goes back to 1993 [8]. The f = 3 GHz choice leads to a relatively short linac, since 
the achievable gradient is roughly proportional to f ½, and gives access to a wide market of the 
necessary pulsed klystrons and accessories. In 1998 a prototype of LIBO was built and power 
tested, with an accelerating gradient of 27.5 MV/m [9, 10]. The acceleration tests performed 
at the superconducting cyclotron of the INFN Laboratorio Nazionale del Sud (LNS) were also 
very satisfactory [11,12].

cyclotron and a linear accelerator of the LIBO type.  

 

In the version of LIBO designed for IDRA, the protons enter with an energy of 30 MeV/u, i.e. 
a  velocity  β = 0.25.  Lower  energies  cannot  be  accepted  because  the  shunt  impedance  of  a 
SCL structure drastically decreases for β ≤ 0.2. This is the first reason for the study of new 
accelerating structures that are more efficient at low energies. The second reason concerns the 
design  of  cyclinacs  for  carbon  ion  therapy.  For  these  applications  the  existing  low  cost 
commercial cyclotrons have maximum C+6 energies of the order of 10 MeV/u, that is too low 
for direct injection into an SCL structure. 

These motivations lead to the CLUSTER concept described in the rest of the paper, which is 
however very interesting for many other applications and thus stands by itself. In Section 2 
we describe the structure and explain its physical principles. In the Section 3 the scheme of 
both  the  coupling  cavities  and  the  end  cells  is  presented.  Section  4  contains  a  detailed 
presentation of how each single component has been studied, adopting a reference frequency 
of  3  GHz.  A  simple  circuit  scheme  is  also  described.  The  experimental  results  of  a  1  GHz 
prototype  are  presented  in  Section  5,  while  Section  6  discusses  a  design  of  a  cyclinac 
employing a 1.5 GHz CLUSTER structure. 

2.  CLUSTER, A NOVEL LINAC STRUCTURE 

The  need  for  a  high  shunt  impedance  in  the  low-medium  β  range  (0.05-0.4)  leads  to  the 
choice of H-mode accelerating cavities, also called TE (Transverse Electric) cavities since the 
electric field is naturally transverse to the axis. These structures have been studied since the 
50’s [13, 14] and are nowadays successfully used, for example in Unilinac at GSI [15] and in 
Linac3 at CERN [16], both working at low frequencies (between 100 and 200 MHz). 

H-mode  cavities  are  drift  tube  cavities  operating  in  the  Hn1(0)  mode,  where  the  index  n  is 
usually 1 (IH cavities; already existing) or 2 (CH cavities, under development). These cavities 

3

are very attractive because of the high shunt impedance for low β’s. This feature is due to the 
fact  that  the  electric  field  is  mostly  concentrated  close  to  the  axis  in  the  accelerating  gaps, 
where it is made parallel to the axis by the metallic drift tubes. Moreover, they are π-mode 
structures,  i.e.  the  RF  accelerating  field  is  phase  shifted  by  180°  between  successive  gaps. 
Such  structures  allow  higher  average  gradients,  which  are  further  increased  in  the  present 
case because of the high frequency (above 1 GHz). 

Large  values  of  the  operating  frequency  imply  two  main  problems:  the  location  of  the 
magnetic quadrupoles for beam focusing and the field sensitivity to mechanical imperfections 
(i.e. frequency perturbations), commonly referred to as “field instability”. These problems are 
best  discussed  with  reference  to  the  CLUSTER  scheme  of  Fig. 2,  which  is  composed  of  a 
sequence of four accelerating sections (tanks) alternating with three coupling cells. 

 

 

 

Figure 2. 
The accelerating tank consists of a sequence of gaps and drifts whose length is constant in a tank (constant β). 

A module of CLUSTER, the “Coupled-cavity Linac USing Transverse Electric Radial” field. 

 
The  accelerating  sections  operate  in  the  π/2  beam  mode  and  contain  m  gaps.  They  are 
connected  by  coupling  sections  consisting  of  coaxial  cylindrical  cavities,  which  allow  the 
location of Permanent Magnet Quadrupoles (PMQ’s), thus solving the first problem. 

The  second  problem  (field  instability)  is  related  to  the  frequencies  of  the  perturbing 
resonances. Some quantitative considerations may be made by the analogy between H-mode 
structures and the four-vane RFQ. Indeed, in the latter case, the frequency ωn of the nth mode 
satisfies the following relationship [17]:

where  ω0  is  the  fundamental  frequency  corresponding  to  the  working  mode,  λ  is  the  RF 
wavelength and L is the length of the RFQ. Eq. (1) can be obtained from an equivalent circuit 
approach  where  the  capacitance  is  uniformly  distributed  along  the  cavity,  and  it  is  a  very 
good approximation of the dispersion curve especially for small values of n. In the case of IH 
or  CH  cavities,  where  the  capacitance  is  concentrated  in  a  discrete  number  of  gaps  (m), 
Eq. (1)  needs  to  be  modified  accordingly.  Indeed,  since  in  an  H-structure  the  length  L  is 
proportional to the number m of accelerating gaps, one may define a positive quantity θ  such 
that

where  the  geometric  factor  θ    has  to  be  evaluated  on  a  case  by  case  basis.  This  formula  is 
valid for both IH and CH structures and has been verified in the case of CLUSTER. 
It  has  to  be  noticed  that  θ  ≠(2/β)2
  in  contrast  with  what  would  be  obtained  from  Eq.  (1) 
through  the  substitution  L=mβλ/2.  Rather,  θ  depends  on  the  geometry  of  the  cavity.  For  a 
fixed β, the number of gaps for unit length increases with the frequency and so does the field 
instability  because,  according  to  Eq. (2),  the  frequencies  ωn  of  the  higher  order  modes  get 
closer  to ω0.  This puts severe limitations on the  length of  such high-frequency  accelerating 
cavities since, in most practical cases, the number of cavities would become too large for a 
given energy step. 

Solutions to this problem have been proposed in the past for TM cavities of the type CCDTL 
[18] or SCDTL [19]. In particular, the second design refers to a 3 GHz structure intended for 
protontherapy.  Both  these  solutions  foresee  a  coupled-cavity  structure  operating  in  the  π/2 
mode:  accelerating  tanks  are  alternated  to  coupling  cavities  so  that  the  field  phase  shift 
between them is π/2 and the electric field is zero in the coupling cavities. This configuration 
allows the field to keep the right configuration, because it is less sensitive to the unavoidable 
frequency  perturbations  [20].  Moreover  PMQ’s  could  be  placed  outside  the  accelerating 
tanks,  instead  of  inside  the  drift  tubes  as  is  usually  done  in  Alvarez  linacs.  The  shunt 
impedance  is  then  higher  than  in  conventional  Alvarez  structures,  but  still  smaller,  at  low 
velocities, than that achievable with the CLUSTER TE structure design. 

3.  COUPLING CELLS AND END CELLS 

The  coaxial  shape  of  the  coupling  cell  of  Fig. 3  has  been  chosen,  having  in  mind  the 
simplicity of  machining  and  easiness  of  PMQ  insertion.  The  TEM  mode  has  a  simple  field 
pattern in coaxial cavities. 
For  the  coupling  cell,  the  RF  wave-particle  synchronism  requires  a  phase  advance  of  2π 
between  the  centers  of  the  two  accelerating  gaps  beside  the  coupling  cell,  so  that  the 
following equation has to be satisfied: 

L = nβλ0 

5

where L is the distance between the centres of the consecutive gaps and n is positive integer. 
On the other hand, a simple coaxial cavity of length l and resonating in a TEM mode satisfies 
the dispersion equation: 

2νpl=pc 
where νp is the pth TEM frequency and c is the speed of light. These two constraints are both 
satisfied  only  in  particular  cases  and  a  simple  tuning  solution  had  to  be  found  in  order  to 
allow the design of compact coupling cells for the whole β range. 
The insertion of an annular capacitive tuner in the cavity centre is a satisfactory solution to 
the  problem.  The  geometric  dimensions  have  been  chosen  in  order  to  both  allow  PMQ 
positioning and also have a frequency close to that of the accelerating tanks, according to the 
theory of resonant coupling [20]. 

 

 

 

 
Figure 3. 

A PMQ inserted in a coupling cell. 

 

An important advantage of this configuration is the possibility of producing the coupling cell 
transversally split in two identical parts, which are successively flanged together. The PMQ 
can  be  easily  inserted  inside  the  cell  before  joining  the  two  parts.  In  case  of  failure  or  bad 
PMQ positioning, the cell can be re-opened and the PMQ easily replaced or repositioned. In 
fact, no tight surface contact (i.e. brazing) is required due to the field pattern of the TEM011 
mode: at the centre of the coaxial cavity the RF currents are zero on both the inner and outer 
surfaces.  Moreover,  this  solution  greatly  simplifies  the  brazing  procedure  of  the  entire 
structure: the brazing would be limited to several short mono-blocs, making possible the use 
of short vacuum furnaces. 

As indicated in Fig. 3, the coupling is obtained through four apertures (slots) on each side of 
the coupling cell. The coupling is magnetic (i.e. with zero electric field in that region) and the 
slots are shaped to guarantee the correct coupling for the required field stability. The coupling 
factor  is  determined  by  the  shape  and  particularly  by  the  length  of  the  slots;  it  is  roughly 
proportional to L3, where L is the slot length [21]. A convenient value for the coupling is a 
compromise between the power efficiency, which decreases with the coupling, and the field 
stability which requires a large pass-band for the dispersion curve, i.e. a large coupling. 

The configuration of the end-cells in each tank has been studied to allow suitable return paths 
for the magnetic field lines, in order to keep the accelerating field as uniform as possible in 
each gap. The appropriate field pattern is obtained by increasing the diameter of the end-cell,

Fig. 4.

4.  RF COMPUTATIONS AND THE DESIGN OF CLUSTER 

The RF design has been performed using the MAFIA code [22] and CST Microwave Studio 
(MWS) [23]. 

4.1 Choice of the accelerating mode 

The first step in the design is the choice of the working mode. To this purpose simple shapes 
have been considered (Fig. 5).

The candidates are the Hn1(0) modes (n = 1,2,3,4) obtained with the geometries of Fig. 5, for 
which  the  basic  RF  parameters,  namely  the  quality  factor  Q  and  the  effective  shunt 
impedance ZT2, have been compared at the nominal frequency f = 3 GHz. 

The use of frequencies which are an order of magnitude higher than those normally employed 
for this kind of cavities makes it impossible to simply scale down the overall dimensions. At 
low frequencies, the ratio between the cavity diameter (Dc) and the drift tube diameter (Dd) is 

7

 

 

 

 

 

 

very large: for the GSI-HLI IH linac Dc/Dd ≈ 22 [24]. At high frequencies, while Dc is scaled 
down  roughly  as  1/f,  this  ratio  must  be  drastically  reduced  to  provide  a  reasonable  beam 
acceptance  of  the  linac.  The  comparative  study  of  four  cavities  is  summarized  in  Fig. 6, 
which considers Hn1(0) modes with n = 1,2,3,4, and points to small value of Dc/Dd especially 
for n = 1 (IH cavity).

Figure 6.  Comparison of four different 3 GHz structures for β = 0.28 and Dd = 6 mm. 

For a TE mode, a small value of Dc/Dd implies a strong component of the radial electric field 
between the drift tubes and the outer tank and thus a low shunt impedance, especially for the 
n = 1 case as shown on the left scale of Fig. 6. The figure shows that ZT2 grows with Dc/Dd, 
with the exception of the fourth mode, for which the large losses on the stems/drifts reduce 
the value of ZT2. The best results in terms of effective shunt impedance are obtained with the 
n = 3  mode,  hereafter  called  3H  cavity,  but  the  difference  with  respect  to  the  more 
conventional  CH  mode  (n = 2)  is  small.  This  latter  solution  has  been  adopted  as  reference 
structure  in  the  CLUSTER  design.  The  3H  structure  might  be  an  interesting  solution  for 
future work. The comparison of Fig. 6 is made at a particle velocity β = 0.28 (E = 40 MeV/u).  

In  Fig. 7  the  shunt  impedances  of  the  IH  and  CH  cavities  are  compared  for  different  beam 
energies.  The  curves  of  Fig. 7  have  been  obtained  by  keeping  constant  both  the  working 
frequency (f = 3 GHz) and the drift over gap length ratio as well as by adjusting the external 
diameter  (Dc).  In  both  cases  the  shunt  impedance  decreases  with  the  beam  energy,  as 
expected for all H-mode cavities. In the IH case, the reduction is more evident and makes the 
IH cavity inadequate for medium energy linacs. In the basic equivalent circuit model a single 
cell can be represented by a single “LCR” loop. The value of the frequency, Q and Z obtained 
by  MWS  computations  allow  to  find  the  values  of  L  (inductance),  C  (capacitance)  and  R 
(resistance). The capacitance C can be represented as the sum of two parallel components: the 
capacitance Cg in the gap and the capacitance Cr between the drifts and the outer tank. In both 
cases, the reduction of the shunt impedance for large β is related to two factors. The first is 
the  increased  losses,  which  are  due  to  the  longer  cavities.  The  second  is  the  increased 

8

contribution of the capacitance Cr to C: indeed, Cr depends on the radial electric field between 
the outer tank and the drifts, whose length increases with β. As shown in Fig. 8, in the case of 
IH cavities (small radius) Cr grows rapidly with β. This is not the case for CH cavities, which 
have a larger radius: this explains the better performance of the CH structure at medium-high 
values of β.

The modification of the shape of the stems, from cylindrical to conical, increases the value of 
the shunt impedance. The use of conic stems, which have a larger volume, implies a larger 
cavity  radius  to  keep  the  same  resonant  frequency.  The  result  is  a  lower  radial  capacitance 
(Cr)  and  consequently  larger  shunt  impedance.  The  energy  dependence  of  the  shunt 
impedance is shown in Fig. 10.

 In  a  very  large  β  range  (0.1-0.6)  it  turns  out  that  CLUSTER  has  a  higher  effective  shunt 
impedance ZT2 than those of the other two structures designed for protontherapy: LIBO [25] 
and the SCDTL, developed by ENEA for the TOP project [26]. 

It  should  be  noticed  that,  in  Fig.  10,  the  beam  hole  radii  are  2.0 mm,  2.5 mm  and  4.0 mm 
respectively  for  CLUSTER,  SCDTL  and  LIBO.  The  reduction  of  the  LIBO  beam  hole  to 
2.0 mm would improve its shunt impedance by nearly 35% for low β; still CLUSTER is more 
efficient up to 140 MeV/u. A comparison of the three structures for a beam hole radius of 2.5 
mm at the energy of 60 MeV/u is reported in Table 1.

CLUSTER  is  the  most  efficient  structure  also  for  the  same  beam  hole  radius  as  shown  in 
Table 1. 

4.2  The end cells 

A noticeable  result concerns the field behaviour in the end-cells, since the field pattern has to 
change  radically  from  the  TE21(0)  mode  into  a  TM01(0)  mode.  This  pattern  is  completely 
different from the one characterizing the termination of a four-vane RFQ, where the angular 
component of the magnetic field has four zeros, corresponding to the four vanes. In a crossbar 
structure, drift tubes and stems compose discrete units. In the end cell, the last drift tube and 
its  corresponding  couple  of  stems  break  the  quadrupole  symmetry.  This  implies  a  TM01(0) 
mode configuration with a rotational magnetic field, whose angular component has no zeros 
although it is slightly modulated in amplitude. 

Fig. 11  shows  the  field  pattern  in  a  transversal  section  of  an  end-cell:  this  is  similar  to  a 
TM01(0) mode (see the arrow plot at the top) with an angular modulation of the amplitude (see 
magnetic  energy  density  contour  plot  at  the  bottom).  Notice  that  the  largest  magnetic  field 
lies in correspondence with the vertical stems on the penultimate drift tube.  

This pattern allows a simple magnetic coupling between the tanks and the coupling cell, since 
the situation is identical to the case of the coupling between two TM cavities having the same 
axis.

4.3 Dispersion curve 

By using MWS, the dispersion curve for a full module of 36 accelerating gaps was computed. 
Three  different  configurations  have  been  compared:  a  module  composed  of  3  accelerating 
sections with 12 gaps each, a module composed of 4 accelerating sections with 9 gaps each, 
and a module of 6 accelerating sections with 6 gaps each. 

Each mode is characterized by its own phase advance between an accelerating section and a 
coupling cell. The amount of resonant modes, considered as composing the dispersion curve, 
is  equivalent  to  the  total  number  of  oscillators  in  the  structure.  For  the  first  case  it 
corresponds to 5 (3 accelerating section and two coupling cells), in the second case to 7 and 
in the third case to 11. 

As  shown  in  Fig. 12,  the  frequency  bandwidth  grows  with  the  number  of  sections;  a  large 
number  of  sections  implies  shorter  accelerating  tanks  (fewer  number  of  gaps)  and 
consequently less stored energy per tank, which originates from a larger coupling.

4.4 Equivalent circuit 

The discrete model of coupled oscillators, based on a pure bi-periodic chain of oscillators, is 
not accurate enough to represent multi-gaps sections and can be applied to CLUSTER only in 
the case of a large number of short coupled sections. Many attempts with conventional tools 
like DISPER [27] have been performed in order to obtain a suitable fit to the dispersion curve 
calculated  using  the  theory  of  coupled  resonators.  Nevertheless  unsatisfactory  results  have 
been obtained, even for the structure with five coupling cells. 
A  more  accurate  study  of  the  different  resonances  and  of  the  dispersion  curve  can  be 
performed using a different circuit approach. The analogy between RF cavities and coupled 
oscillators is a well known tool and, in the case of particle accelerators, this analogy leads to 
useful quantitative estimates. 

Figure 13. 

Example of a circuit with a single coupling cell 

 

A  circuit  model  has  been  developed  in  order  to  reproduce  the  RF  field  behaviour  in 
CLUSTER,  starting  from  the  definition  of  the  coupling  elements  among  the  neighbouring 
gaps, each one conventionally modelled by LC loops (Fig. 13) [28]. 

13

 

 

 

 

 

Differently  from  the  case  of  drift  tube  Alvarez  cavities,  where  the  coupling  element  is 
simulated  by  a  capacitor,  here,  following  Lee  [29],  the  coupling  is  better  simulated  by  the 
insertion  of  an  inductor  L1  between  the  two  neighbouring  LC  loops  representing  the 
oscillators.  Moreover  the  total  inductance  in  the  terminal  loops  (end  cells)  has  been 
represented  by  the  series  of  two  different  inductors  (L0+LE).  The  numerical  value  of  LE  is 
chosen in order to reproduce the right field modulation, with the same amplitude in each gap. 
In agreement with [30],  one obtains LE = 2L1. On the other hand, a suitable scheme for the 
coupling  cell  is  a  mutual  inductance.  The  current  inversion  at  the  middle  of  the  cell  is 
reproduced by bending the LC loop, as shown in Fig. 13. 

A simple MATLAB program has been used to compare the behaviors of the RF structure and 
the  chain  of  oscillators.  The  program  is  based  on  the  matrix  which  characterizes  the 
eigenvalue problem obtained by applying Kirchoff’s laws to the circuit. The input data are the 
frequencies of the coupling cell and of the accelerating tank, the coupling value, the numbers 
of accelerating tanks and of gaps per tank, and also a non-dimensional parameter related to 
the stored energy in the coupling cell. 

The results, presented in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15, are in perfect agreement with MWS simulations 
both for the frequencies (eigenvalues) and the field modulation (eigenvectors).

5.  CONSTRUCTION AND RF TESTS OF THE CLUSTER PROTOTYPE 

A  CLUSTER  model  has  been  built  to  test  the  RF  design  of  the  structure  in  terms  of  field 
behaviour  and  mode  analysis.  A  frequency  f = 1 GHz  was  chosen  to  have  both  a 
longitudinally compact structure and a certain simplicity in the design and the measurements. 
The results can be translated to future 1.5 or 3 GHz designs by using well known scaling laws 
[31, 32]. In the design, the β value was kept constant since particle acceleration is out of the 
present scope. The value β = 0.25 was chosen, which corresponds to about 30 MeV protons. 

The 1 GHz model has a modular geometry and is composed, in its full configuration, of two 
accelerating sections and a central coupling cell, as shown in Fig. 16. The beam hole diameter 
has been fixed at 12 mm, the drift tube thickness has been kept to 1.5 mm because this is a 
suitable value for the mechanical construction. The tank radius is 50 mm and the gap length 

 

 

15

(18 mm) is a consequence of the frequency choice. The total length of the structure in the full 
configuration is 1.1 m. 

 

 

 

Figure 16.  The prototype for low power RF measurements. 

 

The  central  coupling  cell  can  be  removed  to  have  a  single  accelerating  section,  while  the 
number of gaps can be varied at will. Four tuners per each gap (one per quadrant) are used to 
tune  the  structure  and  to  study  the  accelerating  field  pattern  in  presence  of  perturbations. 
Screw tuners are also placed in the end-cells and coupling cells. The CLUSTER structure is 
designed so that the necessary focusing quadrupoles can be easily allocated. 

The central ring in the coupling cell can be machined to tune the frequency of the system. The 
main  mechanical  tolerances  (±0.2 mm)  are  rather  low  for  a  relatively  high  frequency 
structure. 

Several measurements have been performed both in the frequency domain (dispersion curve) 
and  in  the  time  domain  (bead  pulling).  As  shown  in  Fig. 17,  the  validity  of  Eq. (1)  is 
confirmed by the measurements of the frequencies for the different modes (n), with respect to 
the  number  of  gaps  (m).  These  measurements  were  made  on  the  basic  configuration, 
composed of a single accelerating section. 
The fit presented in the Fig. 17, for the θ  parameter in Eq. (2),. gives θ ≅ 1.18. The value of 
θ depends on the geometry of the structure and particularly on the β of the design. The values 
of  θ  for  structures  at  different  β  but  with  the  same  frequency  (3  GHz)  and  with  identical 
geometry of the conic stems have been computed; see Fig. 18. The value of θ is proportional 
to 1/β which means that the problem of the RF stability is more severe for larger β structures.

In  the  full  configuration  with  the  coupling  cell,  it  was  possible  to  obtain  the  resonant

Fig. 19  the  results  are  compared  to  the  configuration  with  a  single  accelerating  section

Figure 19.  Measured frequencies for different geometrical configurations. Ncc indicates the 
number of coupling cells: Ncc = 0 (dotted line) and Ncc = 1. 

The working mode (points in the plot) keeps the same frequency with and without coupling 
cell for any number of gaps. The first superior mode without coupling cell (Ncc+1 mode with 
Ncc = 0; dotted line in the plot) follows Eq. (2). 

By  increasing  the  number  of  gaps,  and  consequently  the  length  of  the  structure,  this  mode 
gets  closer  to  the  working  mode  and  therefore  instability  increases.  Fig. 19  shows  the 
measurements of the first three resonances relative to this mode, (m = 7, 11, 15). The other 
two  (m = 18,  22)  have  been  extrapolated  from  Eq. (2)  with  the  proportionality  coefficient 
determined by the linear fitting of Fig. 17. When the coupling cell is introduced, the structure 
can be considered as a system of three coupled resonators and the working mode assumes the 
configuration of a π/2 mode (Ncc mode with Ncc = 1). The frequency of this mode is the same 
with  and without  coupling  cell  since,  for  a  π/2 mode,  it does  not  have  stored  energy  in  the 
central  coupling  cell.  The  two  neighbor  modes  are  the  π  mode  (Ncc-1  mode  with  Ncc = 1; 
squares  in  the  plot),  that  is  the  lowest  in  frequency,  and  the  zero  mode  (Ncc+1  mode  with 
Ncc = 1; diamonds in the plot). Both modes are dependent on the frequency of the coupling 
cell,  whose  tuning  was  necessary  in  order  to  close  the  stop  band  and  to  have  a  symmetric 
configuration of the two modes with respect to the π/2 mode. 

Fig. 19 is the main result of the present paper and shows how the introduction of the coupling 
cell increases the frequency separation between the modes (as expected from the definition of 
a  coupled  system)  and  consequently  it  improves  the  stability  of  the  system,  especially  for 
high values of m. These results have been obtained with small slots (four on each side of the 

 

 

18

coupling cell with an angular aperture of 40° and only 8 mm width) and small values of the 
coupling (Fig. 20).

The  particular  designs  of  both  the  end-cells  and  the  coupling  cell  have  the  advantage  of 
allowing no practical limitation in the slot dimensions: if needed, the final design could have 
larger slots to improve the coupling. 

The measured electric field pattern along the accelerating axis is shown in Fig. 21. It has been 
obtained with the bead pulling technique and by tuning both the end-cells and the coupling 
cell, but without using any other tuning screws in the accelerating tanks. 

Despite the low mechanical accuracy and the absence of precise tuning, the relative field in 
the  different  gaps  is  within  ±3%  with  the  exception  of  the  four  end-cells,  where  the  field 
assumes a particular configuration. 

Some modifications in the design of the end-cells allowed obtaining a good uniformity in the 
whole structure. Fig. 22 shows the field configuration in a single tank after the design of the 
end-cell was modified. 

This  simple  prototype  confirmed  the  RF  field  behavior  as  expected  from  the  previous 
computations  and  demonstrated  all  the  advantages  provided  by  a  bi-periodic  structure 
working in the π/2 mode in terms of field stability. The design of both the coupling cell and 
the  slots  profited  from  the  measurements  on  the  prototype.  The  tuning  procedure  of  the 
coupling cell was also successfully tested.

6.  DESIGN OF A 1.5 GHZ CLUSTER 

In a cyclinac, CLUSTER is the natural choice to boost the proton beam, which is produced by 
a  commercial  and  cheap  cyclotron,  up  to  a  convenient  energy  for  the  injection  into  LIBO; 
according  to  the  scheme  of  Fig. 23.  A  particular  design  of  a  cyclinac  employing  the 
CLUSTER structure is described in this section. 

The input beam energy for the present design is 15 MeV, since all the commercial cyclotrons 
normally employed for FDG production are in the range 10-18 MeV [33]. This choice allows 
a straightforward adaptation of the design to a specific model of cyclotron. 

The working frequency of CLUSTER has been reduced from 2.998 GHz (LIBO frequency) to 
1.499 GHz in order to increase the beam acceptance of the DTL part of the two section linac.

The CLUSTER-LIBO interface energy was fixed at 66 MeV which is the energy used for the 
treatment  of  eye  melanomas.  In  the  range  15-67 MeV  no  variation  of  the  beam  energy  is 
required  for  the  treatments.  This  gives  the  possibility  to  use  a  single  klystron  to  feed  four 
resonant cavities reducing the overall cost. The candidate klystron is the Thales TH2117 with 
20 MW peak power and 14 kW average power. 

The  four  modules  of  CLUSTER  have  been  designed  to  require  about  the  same  power. 
Particular attention has been devoted to the power distribution from the single klystron to the 
four modules. 

The basic parameters of the two sections of the linac are given in Table 2.

This  cyclinac  design  represents  a  cheaper  and  promising  alternative  to  IDRA  which 
accelerates  protons  starting  at  30  MeV.  The  complete  study  including  beam  dynamics, 
thermo-mechanical  analysis,  and  brazing  procedure  are  part  of  the  future  activities  of  the

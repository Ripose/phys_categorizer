This  paper  proves  that  a  particle  with  mass  different  of  zero  cannot  be  its  own 
antiparticle. Hence, particles such as 
 must have their correspondent antiparticle. 
 
 
Introduction 
 
In a previous paper [1] is questioned the concept of inversion of coordinates symmetry, 
from  which  the  violation  of  parity  in  weak  interaction  was  a  consequence.    After  a 
lengthy  review,  it  was  found  the  cause  of  this  misleading  interpretation.    The  stringent 
requirement  that  imposes  the  theory  of  relativity  on  the  equivalence  of  the  four-space-
temporal  coordinates  was  ignored  in  the  formulation  of  the  principle  of  parity 
conservation. To be more precise the four coordinates, where an event take place are on 
the  same  footing.  Time  coordinate  is  equivalent  to  any  space  coordinate  and  must  be 
bound  to  these  in  the  physical  description  of  any  event.  Therefore,  the  “full”  Poincare 
group, which includes the simultaneous inversion of the space-time coordinates, was not 
considered  on  the  formulation  of  the  reflection  symmetry.  In  previous  paper  this 
misunderstanding was discussed and a solution suggested [1]. 
The prediction of new particles by this new theory it is the point of departure of these two 
inversion concepts. CP, CT, PT are violated in a theory were the group of symmetry is 
not  the  “full”  Poincare group  [2].  The  “full  Poincare  group”  preserves  CPT  invariance.  
However,  the  same  statement  could  not  be  extrapolated  to  theories  based  on  higher 
symmetry groups, Such as Superstrings [3], Quantum Gravity, etc.; where CPT could be 
violated.  Another  larger  symmetry  in  these  theories,  it  would  lead  to  new  invariants 
principles such as CPTX conservation. 
In section I we presented the current physical interpretation of an antiparticle [4]. Section 
II  is  devoted  to  construct  the  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the  “full  Poincare” 
where the existence of new particles is suggested. 
 
2. Antiparticles 
 
In  the  one  particle  scheme  Feynman  and  Stückelberg  interpret  antiparticles  as  particles 
moving backward in time [5]. This argument is reinforced by S. Weinberg who realizes 
that antiparticles existence is a consequence of the violation of the principle of causality 
in quantum mechanics [4].  The temporal order of the events is distorted when a particle

wanders  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  light  cone.    How  is  the  antimatter  generated  from 
matter?      According  to  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  principle  a  particle  wandering  in  the 
neighborhood of the light-cone suddenly tunnels from the timelike region to the spacelike 
2x is 
region; in this region the relation of cause and effect collapses.  Since if an event, at
.0
observed  by  an  observer  A,  to  occur  later  than  one  at 
  An 
x

observer B moving with a velocity v respect to observer A, will see the events separated 
by a time interval given by

events is exchanged for the observer B, that is, 
2x  as observed by 
than the event at
A, it is observed by B as if it were absorbed at
2x before the particle were emitted at 1x . 
The  temporal  order  of  the  particle  is  inverted.  This  event  is  completely  feasible  in  the 
neighborhood  of  the  light-cone,  since  the  uncertainty  principle  allows  a  particle  tunnel 
from time-like to space-like cone regions.  That is, the uncertainty principle consents to a 
particle to reach the space-like region. Since values greater than zero are allowed in next

 is the Compton wave-length of the particle.   The left hand side of the equation 

(2)  can  be  positive  or  space-like  for  distances  less  or  equal  than  the  square  of  the 
Compton wavelength of the particle.  Therefore, causality is violated.  The only way of 
2x ,  before  it  is 
interpreting  this  phenomenon  is  assuming  that  the  particle  absorbed  at
1x  as it is observed by B, is actually a particle with negative mass and energy 
emitted at 
that  it  moves  backward  in  time;  that  is 
t <   [4].    This  event  is  equivalent  to  see  an 
2
antiparticle  moving  forward  in  time  with  positive  mass  and  energy  that  it  is  emitted  at 
1x and it is absorbed at
The square of the mass for the observers A and B is a Poincare invariant.  In other words, 
the  mass  of a  particle  itself is  not  an  invariant,  but  its square  [6].    There  is  nothing  to 
prevent that the rest mass could have different sign in distinct reference frame, as happen 
with  its  energy,  electric  charge  and  spin.    In  a  former  paper,  it  is  conjectured  that  a 
particle moving backward in time possesses a negative mass [7].  When it is observed as 
an  antiparticle  moving  forward  in  time  its  mass  is  positive.  Still  its  mass  square  is  a 
Poincare invariant.   

2x . With this reinterpretation the causality is recovered.

According to the interpretation of antiparticle that it is given in this article,  bosons and 
fermions cannot collapse toward states of negative energy.  The reason is that a particle 
(boson or fermion) has to overcome the speed of light to acquire a negative energy.  This 
event is classically impossible but quantum mechanically feasible.  

3. Unitary Irreducible Representations of Poincare Group with Simultaneous Space-
Time Reflections 
 
The  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the  extended  group  of  Poincare  have  been 
constructed  by  constraining  from  the  onset  the  energy  values  to  be  positive  as  a 
consequence  of  this  assumption  time  reversal  operator  is  antilinear.  Later  the  antilinear 
property  of  the  time  reversal  operator  is  utilized  to  prevent  the  existence  of  negative 
energy  states  for  elementary  particles  [8][9].  In  this  paper,  however  the  opposite 
approximation is proposed. The quantum negative energy states are accepted on the basis 
that the creation of an antiparticle (particle of negative energy) is briefly allowed by an 
interval  of  time  ruled  by  the  uncertainty  principle;  while  the  particle  moves  around  the 
light  cone  boundaries  that  separate  time-like  from  space-like  regions.  On  the 
neighborhood  of  this  boundary  the  probability  of  tunneling  is  greater  than  zero.  A 
collapse  of  particles  toward  negative  energy  states  is  classically  prohibited  by  the 
impossibility  that  a  particle  can  exceed  the  speed  of  light.  However,  in  quantum 
mechanics is briefly permitted by the Heinsenberg uncertainty principle (see eq. (2)); as it 
is discussed above. If this phenomenon occurred continuously, the propagation speed of 
the information between two objects would be infinite. Furthermore, tunneling has a low 
probability  of  occurrence,  and  the  mean  lifetime  of  an  antiparticle  is  in  general  short, 
since this is immediately absorbed by its particle to transform into gamma rays. 
 
The  classical  way  to  construct  the  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the  Poincare 
group is by using the technique of the little group. Let us consider the orbits or regions 
where the magnitude of the four vector ŝ2 = x2+y2+z2-c2t2 is: zero, with all its components 
equal to zero; zero with its components different of zero; greater than zero, and less than 
zero. To obtain these unitary irreducible representations we will use the two dimensions 
space-time t-z of Figure 1, in the momentum representation. Therefore the six regions to 
be discussed are 
 
1. ŝ. ŝ < 0,            
  
2. ŝ. ŝ > 0, t > 0,  
 
3. ŝ. ŝ > 0, t < 0, 
 
4. ŝ. ŝ = 0, ŝ ≠ 0, t > 0,    
 
5. ŝ. ŝ = 0, ŝ ≠ 0, t < 0,      
 
6. ŝ = 0,

invariant [6], but not m0. That is, if one observer sees a particle with rest mass positive 
another observer on an inertial frame could see the same particle with negative rest mass. 
An  electron  with  negative  rest  mass  and  energy  moving  backward  in  space  and  time 
could  be  interpreted  as  its  antiparticle  moving  forward  in  space  and  time  with  positive 
rest mass and energy. This phenomenon could by explained by constructing the unitary 
irreducible  representations  of  the  Poincare  group  with  simultaneous  space-time 
inversions. 
We  have  found  that  on  the  rest  frame  of  the  P(k,s)  representation,  the  rest  mass,

  can  have  two  possible  signs,  positive  or  negative.    The  fact  that

elementary particles traveling backward in time have being identified as antiparticles [5] 
leads  one  to  the  conclusion  that  particles  with  mass  can  not  be  identified  with  its  own 
antiparticles, as it is the case with π0 and Z0. 
To construct the unitary irreducible representations of the full Poincare group one applies 
  of  P(k,s).  
the  space  inversion  followed  by  time  inversion  to  the  basis  vectors 

These  basis  vectors  were  generated  from  the  special  basis  vector

,  where

.    The  space  inversion  Is  leaves 

ˆk   invariant,  and  commutes  with  the 
ˆ
k =
0
generators  of  the  little  group  SU(2).  Therefore,  the  irreducible  representations  of  the 
group, 
,  can  be  labeled  by  the  labels  of  the  rotations,  and  reflection  groups, 
namely the  spin s, and the  parity η.  If one applies space inversions to the  basis vector

with definite parity label η = ±, one obtains

Now, Let us start to construct the inequivalent unitary irreducible representations of the 
Poincare group with space inversions P(k,s,η) .  By applying these inversions to the basis

 of the unitary irreducible representation of SU(2). This 

fact  explains  why  it  is  necessary  to  conjugate  and  transpose  the  wave  equation  of  a 
particle to describe its antiparticle. Thus, time reflection induces negative energy states 
and  these  states  induce  charge  conjugation.  If  a  mirror  reflection  is  a  symmetry 
transformation,  then  this  reflection  must  be  accompanied  by  simultaneous  space-time 
inversions, since the intrinsic parity label is generated by space reflection.  
Due  to  the  fact  that  one  has  to  conjugate  and  transpose,  time  reversal  acquires  the 
properties of an antilinear operator. And since the character of the representations of the

Therefore,  in  this  formulation  the  simultaneous  action  of  space-time  inversions  on  a 
general basis vector (particle) of the representation reverses the energy, momentum, and 
spin  (antiparticle).  The  space  inversion  furnishes  a  definite  parity,  η,  to  the  elementary 
particle  described  by  the  unitary  irreducible  representation.  The  elementary  particle 

 

 

 

10 

violates the causality principle because it is represented in the negative energy sector of 
the light cone. If it has enough energy it can be observed as a particle moving backwards 
in  space  and  time  (antiparticle).  Therefore,  the  C,  T,  P,  CT,  CP,  PT  cannot  conserve 
separately,  but  CPT.  In  my  opinion  not  all  the  symmetries  that  would  enhance  the  full 
Poincare  group  are  known.  Then,  it  is  quite  possible  that  exists  a  violation  of  CPT  for 
physical  phenomena 
large  symmetries.  The  full  group  of 
diffeomorphisms (space-time reflections included) is a larger symmetry than that of the 
full  Poincare  group;  therefore  CPT  could  be  violated  by  quantum  gravity.  By  the  same 
token supersymmetry, supergravity, and superstrings could violate CPT.

Hence, T2 = 1 for integer spin, and T2 =-1for particles of half integer spin.  
 
3.4. Particles of Zero Mass 
 
For  massless  particles,  or  the  future  null  and  past  null  regions  4  and  5,  the  unitary 
irreducible  representations  of  the  Poincare  group  are  labeled  by  unitary  irreducible 
representations  of  its  little  group.  The  little  group  of  that  of  Poincare  group  in  these 
regions  is  the  Euclidean  group  E(2)  in  two-dimensions,  one  will  denote  its  elements  by

Therefore,  these  vectors  belong  to  the  P(0,m)+  P(0,-m)  representation,  contrary  to  the 
representation P(k,m) these representations do not carry spin, but helicity. Therefore, time 
reversal  does  not  induce  a  change  in  sign  of  the  angular  momentum  J,  as  it  does  in 
equation (24).

This equation represents a particle of zero rest mass, and zero helicity, but with a definite 
parity that it changes its momentum and energy under space-time reversal. 
 
We  realize  that  transitions  between  time-like  and  space-like  states  for  a  “massless” 
particle are highly probable, since if the four momentum, p2 = 0, is sharply defined, then 
its four vector position

is  completely  uncertain,  since  its  Compton  wavelength  is  undetermined  [10].    The 
massless particle could exist in any place of the light cone. The principle of causality is 
strongly violated. If one observes a given amount of photons with p2 = 0 is because a big 
amount of other photons populate the space-like, and the time-like regions.  The action, 
of these dark photons, on the universe should be measurable. 
 
 
3.5. Imaginary Mass Particles 
 
In  the  space-like,  region  1,  the  eigenvalue  of  the  square  of  the  four-momentum  is  the 
negative  of  the  square  of  the  rest  mass  of  the  particle.  Therefore,  the  mass  would  be 

13 

 

 

 

imaginary number. No physical interpretation of elementary particles could be associated 
to  this  region;  however,  the  square  of  the  four-momentum  could  have  a  physical 
meaning. It turn out that the square of the four-momentum is not equal to the square of 
the mass for internal lines in a Feynman diagram.  It is conjectured in this article that a 
possible  interpretation  could  be  given  to  the  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the 
“full” Poincare group. Virtual particles would be good candidates to achieve this goal.

The  little  group  of  the  four-vector

3.6 Vacuum Representations 
 
In  region  six  the  little  group  of  the  four-vector 
  is  the  Lorentz  group. 
Because  the  Lorentz  group  is  non-compact,  its  unitary  irreducible  representations  are 
infinite  dimensional.  Therefore,  the  unitary  irreducible  representations  of  the  Poincare 
group in this region are the same than that of the Lorentz group. They are labeled by the 
eigenvalues of the Casimir of the algebra SU(2)XSU(2), that is, the angular momentum 
on three dimensions u, v.  The group SU(2)XSU(2) is locally isomorphic to the Lorentz 
group,  therefore  their  Lie  algebras  are  equivalents.  There  are  two  classes  of  these 
representations,  the  principal  series  (v  =  -iw,  w  real,  j0  =  0,1/2,1,…)  and  the 
complementary  series  (-1  ≤  v  ≤  1;  j0  =  0).    Because  the  combined  space-time 
transformations  commute  with  the  generators  of  the  Lorentz  group  the  states  of  this 
representation have a definite parity. Furthermore, vacuum oscillations make these states 
to  undergo  transitions to  positive  and  negative  energy  states  as  well  as imaginary  mass 
(virtual states).  
 
Conclusion 
 
In this manuscript, it has been proved that the only possible way that a particle to be its 
own  antiparticle  is  that  its  rest  mass  to  be  zero.  This  constraint  is  not  satisfied  by  the 
0π and Z0. By the same token the neutrino could not be a massless particle, since 
particles 
it has an antiparticle. Any criticism to this article is left to be solved on the experimental 
arena.

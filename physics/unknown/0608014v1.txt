ABSTRACT 

 

High-resolution Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been used to classify 

carbonado-diamond.  Previous attempts failed to measure the absorption of carbonado-diamond 
in the most important IR-range 1000-1300 cm-1 (10.00-7.69 µm) because of silica inclusions.  In 

our investigation, KBr pellets were made from crushed silica-free carbonado-diamond and thin 

sections were also prepared.  The 100 to 1000 times brighter infrared radiation of synchrotron 

permits a better spatial resolution that is diffraction limited.  Inclusions and pore spaces were 

avoided.  The FTIR spectra of carbonado-diamond mostly depict the presence of single nitrogen 

impurities, and hydrogen.  The lack of detectable nitrogen aggregates in the infrared spectra, the 

presence of features related to hydrocarbon stretch bonds, and the resemblance of the spectra to 

CVD and presolar diamonds indicate that carbonado-diamonds should be classified as type Ib 

diamond and that these were formed in a hydrogen-rich media, most likely in an interstellar 

environment.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

Carbonado-diamond is the most enigmatic of all diamonds.  The visual appearance is coke-

like, and is best described as a strongly bonded micro-diamond ceramic, with diamond grain 

sizes in the nano- to micro-meter range (Haggerty 1999).   It is characteristically porous, with the 

pore volume up to ~30% measured in single x-ray slices (Vicenzi et al. 2003).  Many carbonados 

consist of cubic micro-diamonds (not hexagonal, lonsdaleite) with diameters of 25-100 µm that 

are set in a fine-grained matrix (Kerr et al. 1948), indicating at least two stages of diamond 

growth (De et al. 2001), but with many that also have a glassy diamond patena indicative of a 

third generation (Haggerty 1998). Other polycrystalline members of the non-traditional diamond 

family are framesite (loosely aggregated clusters), stewardite (magnetic), ballas (fibrous, 

spherical and laminated), and bort (typically metallic gray or black). These occur in kimberlites 

and lamproites and along with traditional diamonds are volcanically intruded and globally 

restricted to old, cold and thick sections of continental crust (Haggerty 1999).  Carbonado-

diamond (2.6 - 3.8 Ga) is found only in Brazil (State of Bahia), and the Central African Republic 

(Bangui), in secondary, metamorphosed sediments; there are minor but unconfirmed occurrences 

in Venezuela and Guyana (Kerr et al. 1948, Trueb & Butterman 1969, Trueb & de Wys 1971). 

There is no consensus for the origin of carbonado-diamond and models of formation are 

extremely varied.  Crust-affiliated minerals rather than deep mantle mineral inclusions in 

carbonado-diamond, coupled with light carbon isotopic compositions, led to the suggestion that 

carbonado-diamond formed by meteoritic impact into a terrestrial carbon substrate (Smith & 

Dawson 1985, Shibata et al. 1993).  This was later supported by the inference (but not proof) that 

the largest magnetic anomaly on Earth, Bangui in the Central African Republic, is a buried iron 

meteorite (Girdler et al. 1992).  Other interpretations for the origin of carbonado-diamond 

include ion-implantation by U and Th in coal deposits (Kaminsky 1987); formation by a complex 

series of reactions in the upper mantle and subsequently in the crust (Kagi et al. 1994); ocean 

floor subduction (DeCarli 1997), followed by mantle plume interaction (Irifune et al. 2003); or 

by a combined growth and sintering process at high P - T (Chen & Tendeloo 1999). In a recent 

review (Heaney et al. 2005), a comparison of carbonado-diamond is made with loosely bonded 

framesite from conventional diamond deposits.  The antiquity of carbonado, its single geological 

location (Congo-Sao Francisco Craton), porosity, sintered patena, and highly reduced mineral 

inclusions (SiC, FeC, SiC, Ti, Fe-Cr), makes a terrestrial origin unlikely. A reasoned (C-rich 

stars, pre-solar diamonds) but speculative alternative is that diamond-carbonado is 

 

2

extraterrestrial (Haggerty 1996), a test of which is examined by new spectroscopic measurements 

in this contribution. 

  Based on the measurable macroscopic properties of diamond, a classification proposed by 

Robertson et al. (1934) is based on boron and nitrogen impurities that have characteristic 

absorption bands.  The infrared IR absorption bands associated with differences in the 

aggregated states of nitrogen (McNamara 2003) are listed in Table I. 

The majority of nitrogen impurities occupy substitutional sites in the diamond lattice (Kaiser 

& Bond 1959).  Single nitrogen substitution has an unpaired electron that is detected by 

paramagnetic resonance.  Nitrogen aggregates, where the free electrons tend to pair, show no 

paramagnetic resonance.  The presence of single substitutional nitrogen centers, labeled P1 and 

the single isotropic line of the K center (Smith et al. 1959), are well established.  According to 

some authors (Klyuev et al. 1978), the K center arises from dangling carbon bonds at the core of 

dislocations.  Nitrogen pairs 

+VN 2

 and 

2N  defects have been identified in carbonado-diamonds 

+

(Nadolinny et al. 2003).  The same study also reported defects containing hydrogen labeled H1 

supporting the hypothesis that carbonados are probably related to hydrocarbon source materials, 

or were subjected to hydrogenation. 

Aggregation of substitutional atoms can be induced not only by long-term exposure to high 

pressures and high temperatures but also by the introduction of vacancies (Collins 1980); 

vacancies may also be increased by radiation. These centers may diffuse through the crystal and 

by combining with an isolated nitrogen atom, H3 (N-V-N) centers can form.  This center has 

been identified in carbonado-diamonds by photoluminescence (Kagi et al. 1994; Magee & 

Taylor 1999).  At high temperatures, the vacancies are released from the H3 centers resulting in 

the formation of A centers.  The presence of A centers in some chemical vapor deposition (CVD) 

diamonds have been detected (McNamara 2003). 

The IR investigation by Kagi et al. (1994) identified a sharp absorption peak at 1384 cm-1 
(7.22 µm) in carbonado-diamond that they assigned to nitrogen platelets (B2 band, 1370 cm-1, 

7.30 µm).  The study of Magee and Taylor (1999), failed to reveal the existence of this band.  

The pores of carbonado are stuffed with silica-based minerals that yield a broad absorption 
feature around 1100 cm-1 (9.09 µm).  The intensity of this feature is much stronger than the 

defect-activated one phonon bands, thus preventing the measurement of the infrared absorption 

of carbonado-diamond (Kagi et al. 1994, Magee & Taylor 1999) in the most important band 
range of diamonds between 1000-1300 cm-1 (10.00-7.69 µm).  No experiments have succeeded in 

overcoming these problems and the diamond type in carbonado has yet to be determined.

2. EXPERIMENTAL 

 

In order to remove silica contamination from the carbonado-diamonds, two Brazilian and two 

Central African samples (3-5 gm) were crushed in tungsten carbide piston cylinder in sleeve 

crusher to < 67µm.  The resulting powders were treated with HCl for three days and then it was 
placed in HF pressure bombs at 60 oC for an additional three days.  The recovered carbonado-

diamond was mixed with KBr in different proportions and then pressed under low vacuum to 

form ~1 mm thick pellets.  A control pellet, with the same weight proportion was made from 

natural diamond crushed to ~

m25 µ .  Three thin sections of carbonado-diamond, two from the 

Central African Republic and one from Brazil, were also prepared. 

The synchrotron IR experiment was carried out at the U2b beam line located at the National 

Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory (NSLS-BNL).  The beam line is 

equipped with a dry nitrogen purged FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet Magna 860) with KBr 

beamsplitter and a narrow band mercury cadmium telluride (MCT/A) detector coupled with an 

IR microscope (Nic-Plan, Nicolet Instruments, Madison, WI) with 32X IR objective (Thermo 

Spectra-Tech) and diffraction limited resolution.  The spectrometer is equipped with a Michelson 

interferometer having capabilities such as rapid scan, step scan and the ability to accept external 

beams and detector.  The bench is configured to use a collimated synchrotron light (beam energy 

800 MeV) through an external input of the spectrometer.  The IR spectra on various carbonado 

samples mixed with dry KBr were collected with a beam spot diameter around 100 µm.  The IR 
spectra were collected in the mid-IR range 4000–650cm-1 (2.50-15.34 µm) at a resolution of 4 
cm-1 with 1056 scans co-added.  Stage control, data collection and processing were performed 

using OMNIC 7.2 (Thermo-Nicolet, Madison, Wisconsin).  The portions of carbonado samples 

were scanned and selected using a CCD camera linked to the infrared images (objective 32X). 

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Using a glowbar (black body) generated source, the infrared absorption spectra of the pellets 

were collected from 650-4000 cm-1(15.34-2.50 µm).  Outside the nitrogen absorption region 
1000-1500 cm-1 additional bands in the 650-1000 cm-1(15.34-6.67 µm) region, and a triplet 
around 2900 cm-1(3.45 µm) were observed in the carbonado-diamond spectra.  The additional 

non - nitrogen absorption peaks are interpreted as C-H related bands.

Using a synchrotron radiation source with a 100 times better signal/noise ratio than the than 

the laboratory instrument using a glowbar infrared source (Reffner et al. 1994) the absorption 
spectra of the thin sections were collected from 650-4000 cm-1(15.34-2.50 µm).  The prominent 
peaks present in all of the spectra are 1102, 2855, and 2926 cm-1 (9.07, 3.50, and 3.42 µm) 

(Figure 1).  Sharp peaks are also present at 913, 1030, 1223, 1282, 1332, 1423, 1467, and 2960 
cm-1 (10.95,9.71, 8.18, 7.80, 7.51, 7.03, 6.82, and 3.38 µm) but are not developed in all runs.  

There are relatively broad features, present in the three thin section investigations, at 1660, 2030, 
2155 cm-1(6.02, 4.93, 4.64 µm). 

3.1. C-H Stretching  Bands 
The peak frequencies (Figure 1) at 2855, 2926, and 2960 cm-1 (3.50, 3.42, and 3.38 µm) can 

be attributed to C-H stretching of diamond hydride and are sensitive to the surface structure 

(Chin et al. 1995; Alfonso et al. 1995; Zhigilei et al. 1997).  Hydrogen ionization experiments on 
diamond single crystals show a band at 2835 cm-1 (3.53 µm) that is ascribed to C(111)-1 x 1 : H, 

(i.e. single carbon – hydrogen bonds on octahedral (111) crystallographic faces), a doublet at 
2921 and 2935 cm-1(3.42, and 3.41 µm) , associated with C-H on (100), and 2857 and 2874 cm-1 

(3.50, and 3.48 µm) bands related to (110) (Chin et al. 1995; Cheng et al. 1996).  The complete 

assignment of C-H stretching in polycrystalline diamonds, however, is incomplete.  The (111) 
surface peak is absent in our spectra.  The prominent bands at 2855, and 2926 cm-1 (3.50, and 

3.42 µm), are assigned respectively to C(110)-1 x 1 : H and C(100)-2 x 1 : H (Guillois et al. 
1999). The band observed at 2960 cm-1 (3.38 µm), and reported in other studies, remains 

unassigned. The lack of the C(111)-1 x 1 : H surface, but the presence of the C(110)-1 x 1 : H 

and C(100)-2 x 1 : H surfaces in the carbonado-diamond spectra is fully consistent with the 

prevalent cuboid habit of individual diamond crystals in our carbonado collection.  And it is also 

consistent with asteriated (zoned and star-shaped) diamonds where cuboidal forms have a strong 

preference for hydrogen, and octahedral segments for nitrogen (Rondeau et al. 2004).  More 

generally, hydrogen is critical to diamond formation in CVD processes, is present as “dangling 
bonds” (i.e. singly occupied outwardly-directed sp3 hybrid orbitals associated with each surface 

carbon atom) in natural diamonds (Evans, 1992), is invoked in “hydrogenated nano-diamonds” 
in meteorites (Andersen et al. 1998), and with “protonation” as the bonding agent that sinters 

microdiamonds in carbonado (Haggerty, 1998).

3.2. Nitrogen Related Bands 

We observe that the absorption peak of the single nitrogen impurity in carbonado-diamond is 

at 1102 cm-1 (9.07 µm) in contrast to 1130 cm-1 (8.85 µm) for high pressure-high temperature 
diamonds.  The other substitutional nitrogen related peak at 1350 cm-1 (7.41 µm) also shows a 
red shift to 1322 cm-1 (7.56 µm).  The red shifts are most likely due to the presence of hydrogen.  
The dominant absorption peak at1102 cm-1 (9.07 µm) is reported in the IR spectra of presolar 

diamonds from the Allende meteorite (Lewis et al. 1989), and in CVD diamonds (Anderson 

1998).  There is no indication for higher order nitrogen centers or for N-platelets in the IR 

spectra of carbonado-diamond. 

The absorption peak at 1384 cm-1 (7.22 µm), reported by Kagi et al. (1994), has not been 

confirmed by other researchers.  The position of the platelet absorption peak correlates with 
nitrogen abundance and inversely with platelet size; therefore, the 1384 cm-1 (7.22 µm) 

absorption peak should be due to small platelets sizes and with abundant nitrogen.  Carbonado-

diamond, however, has low nitrogen contents (100-300 ppm) that should result in large platelets 

and a corresponding red shift rather than the blue shift suggested by Kagi et al. (1994).  The 
absorption peak of aggregated platelets (at  ~1370 cm-1 ~7.30 µm) is always accompanied by an 
A absorption peak at 1282 cm-1 (7.80 µm) (Davis 1977, Mendelssohn & Milledge 1995), but is 

absent in the spectra collected by Kagi et al. (1994).   The absence of the A aggregates (pairs) in 
the spectra raise the possibility that the 1384 cm-1 absorption peak might not originate from 
diamond.  One explanation might be that the 1384 cm-1 peak could be due to BN contamination 

(Mendelssohn & Milledge 1995) in the stainless container used to crush the carbonado (Kagi et 

The only other absorption band of interest at 1030 cm-1 (9.71 µm) is likely from point defects 

al. 1994). 

(Pankove & Qiu 1994).  

 

3.3. Other Peaks 

The broad band features at 2030 and 2155 cm –1 (4.93, 4.64 µm) are most likely related to 
diamond double phonon absorptions (Klein et al. 1992). The 1660 cm-1 (6.02 µm) band can be 
assigned to C=C.  The remaining bands at 913, 1282, 1423, and 1467 cm-1 (10.95, 7.80, 7.03, 

6.82 µm) can be assigned to PAH-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Allamandola et al. 1989). 
A concern in the PAH assignment is that the 3040 cm-1 (3.29 µm) band is absent in our spectra.    

 

6

The presence of PAH bands in the spectra is consistent with carbonado-diamonds containing 

~0.002-0.004 wt.% (Kaminsky et al. 1991); hydrocarbon peaks were also obtained from the thin 

sections, confirming that these are not an artifact of hydrofluoric acid treatment. 

4. CONCLUSIONS 

From the first complete infrared FTIR absorption spectra for carbonado-diamond we show 

that hydrogen stretching bands at 2855, 2926, and 2960 cm-1 (3.50, 3.42, and 3.38 µm) are 
present.  The strongest absorption band at 1106 cm-1(9.04 µm) is attributed to substitutional 

nitrogen in hydrogenated diamond.  Based on these spectra we suggest that carbonado-diamond 

be classified as type Ib, in common with synthetic high P-T diamond, and CVD diamond, neither 

of which has undergone long term annealing, typical of deep Earth mantle environments. 

The identified absorption peaks in carbonado-diamond, with the exception of some PAH 

related bands, are almost identical with the spectra reported for presolar and CVD diamonds 

(Andersen et al. 1998; Braatz et al. 2000), indicating that these diamonds were most likely 

formed in similar, hydrogen-rich environments. 

Young intermediate-mass stars (HD 97048 and Elias 1), surrounded by extended envelopes of 

gas and dust that are the remnants of star formation processes (Guillois et al. 1999; Van 
Kerkhoven et al. 2002), show well established diamond related bands at 2915 and 2832 cm-1 

(3.43, and 3.53 µm). The surface C-H stretching is size-dependent and the bands observed in HD 

97048 and Elias 1 can only be explained by diamond particles larger than 50 nm (Jones et al. 

2004), which is characteristic of carbonado-diamond.  The close resemblance of the FTIR 

spectra of carbonado-diamond to presolar diamonds in meteorites, and to interstellar diamond 

dust now provides additional strong evidence that carbonado is of extraterrestrial origin.

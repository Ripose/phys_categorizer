Abstract 

We report on the properties of thick GEM-like (THGEM) electron multipliers made of 0.4 mm thick double-sided Cu-clad G-
10 plates, perforated with a dense hexagonal array of 0.3 mm diameter drilled holes. Photon detectors comprising THGEMs 
coupled to semi-transparent CsI photocathodes or reflective ones deposited on the THGEM surface were studied with Ar/CO2 
(70:30),  Ar/CH4  (95:5),  CH4  and  CF4.  Gains  of  ~105  or  exceeding  106  were  reached  with  single-  or  double-THGEM, 
respectively;  the  signals  have  5-10  ns  rise  times.  The  electric  field  configurations  at  the  THGEM  electrodes  result  in  an 
efficient  extraction  of  photoelectrons  and  their  focusing  into  the  holes;  this  occurs  already  at  rather  low  gains,  below  100. 
These detectors, with single-photon sensitivity and with expected sub-millimeter localization, can operate at MHz/mm2 rates. 
We discuss their prospects for large-area UV-photon imaging for RICH.    

Keywords: single-photon detectors, gas-avalanche detectors, GEM, Thick GEM-like multiplier  

1. Introduction  

large  multiplicities 

RICH  detectors  have  become  routine  tools  for 
relativistic-particle identification in large accelerator-
based  particle  and  heavy-ion  experiments.  The  high 
counting  rate  and 
in  some 
experiments impose harsh requirements on the design 
and  operation  of  RICH  system  and  on  the  photon 
detectors in particular. They are required to have fast 
response and excellent detection efficiency for single 
photons, and at the same time minimum sensitivity to 
ionizing  background  radiation.  They  are  often 
required to have very large effective area, of several 
square  meters,  or  to  operate  within  non-vanishing 
fields.  Gaseous  detectors  are  good 
magnetic 
this  assignment.  Though  wire 
candidates 

for 

chambers have been playing an important role in the 
detection  of  single  UV  photons,  their  sensitivity 
(gain)  is  limited  by  secondary  photon-  and  ion-
feedback  effects.  The  latter  also  cause  photocathode 
(PC) damage. 

Good candidates for photon detectors in RICH are 
gaseous  photomultipliers  where  photoelectrons  (PE) 
are multiplied within holes. It has been demonstrated 
that  such  mode  of  operation  strongly  reduces 
secondary  effects  and  results  in  high  gain  and  fast 
signals.  An  array  of  independent holes  provides  true 
pixilated  radiation  localization.  The  idea  has  been 
studied for a large variety of applications throughout 
the  last  three  decades  [1].  The  most  extensively 
studied and applied hole-array avalanche multiplier is 
the  Gas  Electron  Multiplier  (GEM)  [2],  made  of  50 
µm  Kapton®  foil  perforated  with  50-70  µm  etched 
holes  at  ~140  µm  pitch.  The  GEM's  most  important

properties  are  the  high  gain  of  single  or  cascaded 
elements in a variety of gases including noble gases, 
the  fast  (ns)  signals  and  the  efficient  coupling  to 
gaseous or solid radiation convertors, as reviewed in 
[3]. One of the most interesting applications is that of 
single-photon 
in 
imaging  detectors 
particular,  that  of  a  cascaded  GEM  with  a  reflective 
photocathode  deposited  on  top  of  the  first  GEM  in 
the  cascade  [4,5,6].  Other  detectors  were  proposed, 
with  coarser  hole-array  multipliers, 
like  glass 
Channel  Plates  and  the  G-10  made  Optimized  GEM 
[7].  

for  RICH, 

The  Thick  GEM-like 

electron  multiplier 
(THGEM) discussed here [8,1] is produced by simple 
industrial processes; holes are drilled in a double-face 
Cu-clad  printed  circuit  board  and  the  hole's  rim  is 
etched to prevent discharges. The THGEM might be 
regarded  as  a  scale-up  of  standard  GEM.  However, 
the  electric  fields, 
the  avalanche  multiplication 
parameters  (e.g.  Townsend  coefficient)  and  the 
electron and ion transport parameters (e.g. diffusion) 
do  not  scale  up  with 
thickness. 
Therefore, 
the  THGEM  properties  cannot  be 
straightforwardly derived from those of GEM, and a 
comprehensive  new  study  was  required  [1].  In  this 
article  we  present  a  concise  summary  of  our  study 
that  concerns  the  THGEM  potential  application  as  a 
large-area UV-photon imaging detector for RICH.     

the  substrate 

2. The THGEMs and the experimental procedures 

THGEM  electrodes,  of  1-8  cm2,  were  produced 
from G-10 plates using industrial PCB processing of 
precise  drilling  and  etching.  Some  multipliers  were 
made of Kevlar, as discussed below. In all cases the 
etched  copper  left  a  0.1mm  space  at  the  hole  rim;  it 
was  found  important  for  preventing  discharges  and 
therefore for reaching considerably higher gains. Out 
of the large assortment of tested THGEMs [1] (0.4 - 
3.2 mm thick, 0.3 - 1.5 mm hole diameters and 0.7 - 
4.0 mm pitch, respectively), the most appropriate for 
atmospheric  pressure  operation  were  found  to  be 
those of 0.4 mm thickness and 0.3 mm hole diameter. 
Unless written  otherwise,  all  the  data presented here 
were obtained from such an electrode, with a pitch of 
0.7 mm (Fig. 1).   

incorporate 

The  experimental  setups  and  procedures  used  for 
measuring  the  effective  gain  are  described  in  [8,1]. 
The  detectors 
semitransparent  or 
reflective  CsI  PCs  coupled  to  single  or  double 
THGEMs.  The  effective  gain  is  the  product  of  the 
true  gain  in  the  holes  and  the  electron  transfer 
efficiency  (ETE),  namely  the  efficiency  to  focus  the 
PEs into the holes. The effective gain is obtained by 
comparing  the  current  from  the  last  electrode  in  the 
THGEM cascade to the PE current emitted  from the 
PC.  Such  current-mode  measurements  do not  permit 
separating  the  true  gain  and  ETE.  But  at  high 
THGEM  gains  the  ETE  is  100%  and  the  effective 
gain  obtained  from  current-mode  measurements  is 
identical  to  the  true  gain;  at  very  low  THGEM 
voltages,  below  the  multiplication  threshold,  the 
effective gain value is equal to the ETE value. 

A  true  separation  of  ETE  and  gain  is  achieved 
with  the  pulse-counting  method,  described  in  details 
in  [9,10].  It  is  based  on  recording  single  electron 
pulses, in which case electron transfer inefficiency is 
directly translated to counting rate deficiency. We use 
a relative measurement, comparing the counting rate 
in  the  examined  system  to  that  recorded  in  a 
reference  system  known  to  have  100%  ETE.  This  is 
done, of course, under exactly the same experimental 
conditions, with identical PC, UV-light illumination, 
and total pulse-gain and electronics chain. The pulse-
counting  method  was  used  to  obtain  the  transfer 
efficiency of the THGEM with either semitransparent 
or  reflective  PCs,  in  various  gases.  More  details  are 
given elsewhere [1].  

3. Results  

3.1. Effective gain 

Fig. 2 depicts the effective gain measured with the 
THGEM  of  Fig.  1,  in  various  gases.  The  data  was 
obtained  with  a  reflective  CsI  PC  deposited  on  the 
top  of  the  THGEM.  The  maximal  gain  varies 
between 104 in pure CF4 and 105 in Ar/CH4 (95:5). A 
higher  total  gain  was  obtained  by  operating  two 
THGEMs  in  cascade;  they  can  be  mounted  ~5  mm 
apart with a high transfer field, up to 3kV/cm, applied 
between  them.  Fig.  3  shows  the  effective  gain  in

Ar/CH4  (95:5)  and Ar/CO2 (70:30),  measured with  a 
semitransparent  CsI  PC  and  a  cascade  of  two 
identical  THGEMs  (of  Fig.  1),  equally  biased, 
mounted 5 mm apart with a transfer field of 3kV/cm 
between them; the gain of a single element is shown 
for  comparison.  The  total  gain  of  the  cascade  seems 
to  be  higher  than  the  product  of  the  two  individual 
elements'  gains.  As  confirmed  by  electric-field 
calculations, this is due to the very high transfer field, 
which  penetrates  inside  the  THGEM  holes  and 
modifies the multiplication factor.     

3.2. Electron transfer efficiency (ETE) 

The ETE, the efficiency to focus the electrons into 
the  holes,  plays  an  important  role  in  any  hole-based 
gas multipliers, including the THGEM; it affects the 
effective gain and the total gain in cascaded operation 
mode.  In  particular  the  ETE  defines  the  detection 
efficiency  of  single  PEs.  It  depends  on  the  point  of 
origin  of  the  PEs  and  on  the  electric  fields  -  Edrift 
above  the  THGEM  and  ETGEM  inside  the  holes.  The 
general  trends  are  the  same  as  in  standard  GEMs 
[11,3]: with electrons originating from the drift space 
above the THGEM (e.g. with a semi-transparent PC) 
it is important to have a large ETGEM/Edrift ratio; with 
electrons originating from a reflective PC on the top 
surface  of  the  THGEM  it  is  optimal  to  use  Edrift=0 
and have high ETGEM. However, due to the larger and 
denser holes in the THGEM discussed in this article 
as  compared  to  standard  GEM,  the  ETE  is  reaching 
100%  already  at  rather  low  gains.  This  is  shown  in 
Fig.  4  for  a  reflective  PC  on  the  THGEM  of  Fig  1. 
Similarly, with a semitransparent PC the ETE reaches 
100%  already  at  gains  of  10-100,  depending  on  the 
gas [1].  

The dense holes array in this THGEM leaves only 
55% of  the  surface for  the reflective  PC;  a  THGEM 
with  hole  distance  of  1mm,  leaving  77%  of  the 
surface  for  the  reflective  PC  (standard  GEM  has 
~80%)  was  recently  tested.  The  effective  gain  and 
ETE results are almost identical. 

3.3. Pulse rise-time and counting-rate capability  

Avalanche development within 0.4mm long holes 
results in typical pulse rise-time of 8-10ns, as shown 

in  Fig  5.  The  pulses  are  almost  as  fast  as  that  of 
GEMs [12]. 

The  counting  rate  capability  of  the  THGEM  was 
measured  with  single  PEs  from  a  reflective  PC.  No 
effective-gain drop was observed up to ~1MHz/mm2 
with  gain  4x104  [1].  For  comparison,  in  standard 
GEM, space charge effects with x-rays were not seen 
up to ~0.3 MHz/mm2 at a similar gain [13].  

3.4. Ion backflow 

Using  a  single  THGEM  coated  with  a  reflective 
PC and a 0 field in the gap above it, 98% of the ions 
created  in  the  holes  are  collected  at  the  PC.  In  this 
case, similar to GEM, it is possible to reduce the ion 
backflow only by cascading at least two THGEMs.  
Using  a  single  THGEM  and  a  semitransparent  PC 
placed a few mm above it, the ion backflow fraction 
collected at the PC increases almost linearly with the 
field applied between the two (Fig 6). With 1kV/cm 
(sufficient for full PE extraction from the PC) under 
the  conditions  of  fig  6,  the  ion  backflow  fraction  is 
10%. Using this THGEM as a second multiplier in a 
cascade,  this  fraction  represents  the  amount  of  ions 
flowing to the first THGEM, of which part is further 
trapped  on  the  first  THGEM’s  metallic  bottom 
electrode. 

3.5. Operation in CF4 

The THGEM operation in CF4 provides high gain, 
good ETE and fast pulses. However, this operation is 
problematic due to the high voltages required in this 
gas,  causing  sporadic  sparking.  We  found  that  the 
latter  caused  an  irreparable  damage  to  the  electrode, 
which  limited  the  maximum  attainable  voltage. 
Subsequent discharges further reduced the maximum 
attainable voltage. We suspected that the CF4 sparks 
etch the glass-fiber matrix of the G-10 material, and 
therefore  produced  a  THGEM  electrode  out  of 
Kevlar-based  printed  board.  However,  though  visual 
inspection of the electrode did not reveal any defects, 
it was not possible to raise the voltages to the values 
required  by  the  CF4  gas,  for  reasons  not  yet 
understood. Other materials are presently considered, 
such as Teflon–based printed boards.

The  newly 

introduced  THGEM  opens  new 
possibilities  for  conceiving  large-area  UV-photon 
detectors  of  moderate  (sub-millimeter)  localization 
resolution.  These  have  potential  applications  in 
various 
large-area  Cherenkov 
radiation  imaging  detectors.  UV-photon  detectors  in 
RICH  devices  do  not  require  high  localization 
resolutions but rather good single-photon sensitivity, 
low  sensitivity  to  ionizing  background  and  in  some 
cases  high  counting-rate  capability.  Though  multi-
GEM  photomultipliers  with  reflective  PCs  [5,14,15] 
seem  adequate  for  RICH, 
the  new  THGEMs 
discussed  here  may  offer  a  simpler  and  more 
economic solution. The study presented here, and in a 
THGEM 
more 
photomultipliers  with  semitransparent  and  reflective 
CsI PCs, indicates that such detectors can operate at 
high gain in a variety of gases including CF4, though 
the issue of permanent damage due to sparks in CF4 
requires  further  investigation.  In  both  operation 
modes the PEs are efficiently detected; the signals are 
fast  and  the  counting  rate  capability  is  in  the 
MHz/mm2 
range.  As  with  multi-GEM  based 
photomultipliers  [4],  THGEMs  with  reflective  PCs 
deposited  on  their  top  surface,  employing  a  slightly 
reversed  drift  field,  have  potentially  good  photon 
detection  efficiency  (due  to  the  thick  PC  and  high 
ionizing 
surface 
field)  but 
background,  as  demonstrated 
this 
operation  mode,  PEs  are  efficiently  extracted  and 
focused  into  the  THGEM  holes,  while  particle-
induced  electrons  are  deflected  in  the  opposite 
direction; 
invaluable  for 
applications  in  accelerator  physics.  On  the  other 
hand,  THGEMs  with  semitransparent  PC  have  an 
improving 
advantage  of  reduced 
photocathode longevity and stability.

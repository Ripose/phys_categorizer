Abstract. -

 A physical consequence of a well-known Fermi’s theorem: no motion of masses 

 

 

 

can generate gravitational waves.

 Fermi’s geometrical theorem [1] as generalized by Eisenhart [2] affirms: For a 
manifold endowed with a symmetric connection it is possible to choose a coordinate 
of the connection are zero

corresponding to a generic motion of our medium with respect to a given reference

means  that  the  gravitational  field  on  L  has  been  obliterated.  Consequently,  no 
gravitational wave has been sent forth. Now, line L is quite generic, and therefore 
no motion of the continuous medium can give origin to a gravitational radiation. -

The  absence  of  a  “mechanism”  apt  to  generate  gravitational  waves  can  be 
proved also by other arguments ([3], [4], [5], [6]). In paper [5] I have emphasized, 
in particular, that any particle of an incoherent “cloud of dust”, characterized by a 
mass tensor

(where  r
is  the  invariant  mass  density),  describes  a  geodesic  line:  accordingly,  it 
cannot emit gravitational waves. A simple application: the gravitational motions of 
the members of solar system.    
 
In  paper  [6]  I  have  given  a  very  simple  argument  according  to  which  no 
motion  (gravitational  or  non-gravitational)  of  a  mass  point  can  produce 
gravitational  waves.  (The  restriction  of  all  the  above  arguments  to  the  motions  of 
point  masses  is  clearly  inessential  from  the  conceptual  point  of  view).  Of  course, 
the  above  results  destroy  the  current  conviction  of  the  real  existence  of  the 
gravitational waves [7].

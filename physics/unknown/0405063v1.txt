Abstract.  The  unreduced,  universally  nonperturbative  analysis  of  arbitrary  many-body  interaction 
process  reveals  the  irreducible,  purely  dynamic  source  of  randomness.  It  leads  to  the  universal 
definition  of  real  system  complexity,  where  the  internally  chaotic  self-organisation  emerges  as  a 
characteristic case of complex interaction dynamics. One obtains the causally complete description of 
the  world  structure  emergence,  from  elementary  particles  to  consciousness,  including  practically 
important and fundamentally substantiated propositions for self-formation research and applications. 

Introduction 

Any  structure  formation  process  originates  in  the  underlying  interactions.  A  generic  interaction  is 
described  mathematically  by  a  nonintegrable  dynamic  equation,  which  constitutes  the  unreduced 
formulation of the many-body problem. Not only it cannot be solved within the conventional theory 
framework,  but the  latter does  not  provide,  in  general,  any  sound  ideas  about  the  true  meaning  of 
“nonintegrability”. Various approximations, always reduced to a version of perturbation theory, are 
then used to transform the problem into an integrable model of the real system that does possess a 
closed, or “exact”, solution, but lacks some essential properties of structure formation, among which 
the  autonomous  system creativity, i.e. explicit structure emergence without its artificial insertion in 
another  form,  is  of  particular  interest  for  understanding  of  self-formation  processes,  ubiquitous  in 
living nature and now also intensively studied in artificially designed, often small-scale systems. 

In this report we describe a recently elaborated, universally applicable method of solution of the 
unreduced  many-body  problem  and  show  that  the obtained  nonperturbative, truly  general  problem 
solution  possesses  the  quality  of  autonomous  creativity,  inevitably  absent  in  the  conventional, 
reduced models and perturbative solutions. This essential quality of real structure formation emerges 
together with the universally valid concept of dynamic complexity and chaoticity based on the key 
property  of dynamic multivaluedness and entanglement of the unreduced problem solution missing 
in  its  reduced  models  (including  the conventional  versions of “complexity”, “chaoticity”, and “self-
organisation”) [1-5]. We then describe the main properties of the unreduced dynamic complexity and 
the ensuing applications to various natural and artificial structure formation processes. 

Unreduced Analysis of Arbitrary Many-Body Interaction Problem 

We  start  with  the  most  general  formulation  of  a  problem  of  interaction  within  a many-component 
system [2], in the form of existence equation that generalises various particular equations:

state” of the system elements, i.e. the state with minimum energy and complexity. 

In  each  equation  for  y n(x ),  Eqs.  5b,  we  express  y n(x )  through  y 0(x )  using  the  usual  Green 
function for the “homogeneous” equation part [1-6]. Substituting the result into Eq. 5a, we get the

where the coefficients ci should be found by state-function matching at the boundary/moment where 
the  effective  interaction  vanishes.  The  observed  (generalised)  density,  r (x ,Q),  is  obtained  as  the 
state-function squared modulus, r (x ,Q) = |Y (x ,Q)|2 (for “quantum” and other “wave-like” levels of 
complexity), or as the state-function itself, r (x ,Q) = Y (x ,Q) (for “particle-like” levels) [1]. 

Although  the  “effective”  problem  expression,  Eqs.  8-12,  is  formally  equivalent  to  its  initial 
formulation, Eqs. 1,2,5, it reveals the qualitatively new phenomenon of dynamic multivaluedness (or 
redundance),  which  appears  as  a  redundant  number  of  locally  complete,  and  therefore  mutually 
incompatible, solutions of the effective existence equation, Eqs. 8-9, called system realisations (each 
of  them  represents  a  completely  defined  system  configuration).  As  all  realisations  are  equally 
possible  and  real,  the  system  is  forced,  by  the  driving  interaction  itself,  to  permanently  change  its 
realisations in a causally random order. The multiplicity of realisations follows from the elementary 
calculation  of  the  eigen-solution  number  determined  by  the  highest  power  of  the  characteristic

, whereas the mentioned additional set of solutions forms the specific, “intermediate” 

realisation that plays the role of transitional state during chaotic system jumps between the “regular” 
realisations and provides thus the universal, causally complete extension of the quantum-mechanical 
wavefunction and classical distribution function [1-3]. Note that the “effective” problem formulation 
is  well  known  under  the  name  of  “optical,  or  effective,  potential  method”  (see  e.  g.  [7]),  but it  is 
invariably  used  in  its  perturbative,  reduced  version  that  “kills”  dynamic  multivaluedness  and 
corresponds  to  unrealistic,  dynamically  single-valued,  or  unitary,  system  “model”  devoid  of  any 
intrinsic  creativity  (the  single  remaining  realisation  corresponds  usually  to  the  intermediate 
realisation,  i.  e.  generalised  distribution  function,  representing  a  statistically  averaged,  effectively 
one-dimensional, or even zero-dimensional, projection of unreduced, multivalued system dynamics). 
The derived dynamic multivaluedness and randomness of the unreduced, general problem solution 
means  that  the  measured  system  density,  r (x ,Q),  should  be  presented  as  the  special,  causally,  or 
dynamically, probabilistic sum of the corresponding densities for individual realisations, {r r(x ,Q)}, 
obtained by solution of the effective existence equation, Eqs. 8-9:

above  and  consisting  in  permanent  change  of  regular  system  realisations  in  dynamically  random 
(chaotic) order by passing each time through the intermediate realisation. The dynamically obtained, 
a  priori  probability  of  the  r-th  actually  observed  realisation,  a r,  is  determined,  in  general,  by  the 
number, Nr, of elementary, experimentally unresolved realisations it contains:

According to “generalised Born's rule” that follows from the dynamical matching conditions naturally 
realised in the intermediate realisation (wavefunction), the dynamic probability values are practically 
determined  by  the  values  of  the  generalised  wavefunction  (or  distribution  function)  obeying  the 
causally extended, universal Schrödinger equation [1,2]. 

The property of dynamic entanglement of the interacting system components is closely related to 
dynamic multivaluedness and appears in the unreduced solution, Eq. 12, as products of functions of 
Q  and  x   “weighted”  by  the  dynamically  determined  factors  which  account  for  the  physically 
transparent nonseparability of the entangled configuration of each system realisation (however, the 
system components transiently disentangle during its chaotic jumps between realisations [1-4]). This 
nonseparability of the dynamically multivalued entanglement only increases due to the hierarchically 
reproduced, dynamically fractal structure of the developing interaction process, where the solutions 
of the truncated system of equations, Eqs. 10, show the same properties of dynamic multivaluedness 
and entanglement obtained by the same EP method and reproduced at all naturally emerging levels of 
structure  formation  [1-4].  This  dynamically  probabilistic  fractal  extends  considerably  the 
conventional fractality concept and contributes essentially to unreduced interaction creativity,  since

finer  parts  of  its  distributed  structure  provide  the  causally  obtained  “interaction  potential”  for  the 
next  level  of  structure  formation,  while  the  interaction-driven  randomness  accounts  for  the 
autonomous, dynamic adaptability of the emerging “living” structures.

After  the  unreduced  interaction  analysis  has  explicitly  given  the  complete  set  of  realisations,  the 
dynamic complexity itself, C, is universally defined as any growing function of (observed) realisation 
, or the rate of their change, equal to zero for the (unrealistic) 
number, 
case  of  only  one  realisation,  C(1)  =  0.  It  is  just  that,  unrealistically  simplified  “model”  (zero-
dimensional,  point-like  projection)  of  reality  which  is  exclusively  considered  in  the  conventional, 
unitary science (including its concepts of ”complexity”, “chaoticity”, “self-organisation”, etc.), which 
explains  all  its  persisting  “difficulties”,  “mysteries”,  and  “insoluble  problems”,  easily  finding  their 
natural, dynamically multivalued solution by the unreduced complexity concept [1-6] that emerges as 
the direct extension of the unitary knowledge model to the dynamically multivalued reality.

  and 

Two  limiting,  characteristic  cases  of  the  unreduced  interaction  dynamics  are  then  obtained, 
together  with  the  inhomogeneous  transition  between  them  [1,2].  If  the  parameters  (universally 
expressed by frequencies) of the interacting entities and interaction itself are close to each other, then 
the  regime  of  uniform,  or  global,  chaos  emerges,  characterised  by  a  homogeneous  distribution  of 
  for  all  r  in  Eq.  14)  and  the  corresponding, 
realisation  probabilities  (i.  e.

“very  irregular”  system  behaviour. If there is essential parameter difference within the system, then 
the regime of dynamically multivalued self-organisation, or self-organised criticality (SOC) sets in, 
where  the  realisation  probability  distribution  is  essentially  inhomogeneous, and  the  (few)  emerging 
low-frequency,  externally  “regular”  structures  contain,  or  “enslave”,  (many)  high-frequency, 
chaotically  changing  constituents.  By  contrast  to  the  conventional  self-organisation  and  similar 
concepts,  the  unreduced,  real-world  SOC  always  has  the  chaotic  (multivalued)  and  fractal 
(hierarchic)  internal  structure  and  origin.  It  provides  also  the intrinsically  unified extension  of  the 
whole  diversity  of  similar  concepts,  remaining  irreducibly  separated  and  incomplete  within  the 
unitary  “science  of  complexity”,  such  as  self-organisation  (synergetics),  SOC,  “control  of  chaos”, 
“synchronization”,  “attractors”,  and  “mode  locking”.  Moreover,  the  permanently  localised, 
trajectorial behaviour from the “classical” (“Newtonian”) science is causally obtained as a particular 
case  of  the  internally  chaotic  SOC,  while  the  laws  of  classical  mechanics  (and  their  relativistic 
extension)  can  now  be  consistently  derived  (and  extended)  in  terms  of  the  underlying  unreduced 
complexity [1,2], instead of their imposition by formal, flawed postulates in the unitary theory. 

The universal criterion of global (uniform) chaos onset is obtained in the form [1,2]

The  unified  theory  of  unreduced  dynamic  complexity  culminates  in  the  rigorously  substantiated, 
universal  law  of  symmetry,  or  conservation,  of  complexity  [1,2],  which  includes  the  causally 
extended,  complex-dynamical  versions  of  all  the  (correct)  laws  and  “principles”  of  the  unitary 
science and states that the total, unreduced system complexity is always preserved, but only by way 
of  its  unceasing  transformation  (development,  unfolding)  from  the  latent,  “potential”  form  of 
dynamic  information  (universally  expressed  by  the  generalised  mechanical  action)  to  the  explicit, 
unfolded form of dynamic entropy. It is important that now any process, including emergence of the 
most externally “regular” structure, is definitely associated with the dynamic entropy growth, which 
resolves bundles of stagnating problems of the conventional science (including problems around time 
and  life).  Contrary  to  “regular”,  but  “broken”  symmetries  of  the  unitary  science,  the  symmetry  of 
complexity  is  always  exact  (never  “broken”),  but  reveals  symmetric  relations  between  and  within 
always somewhat different, irregular structures and dynamic regimes. 

The  experience  of  the  already  realised  applications  of  the  universal  science  of  complexity,  from 
fundamental  physics  to  the  theory  of  consciousness  and  humanitarian  fields  [1-6],  confirm  the 
rigorously  substantiated  conclusions  that  have  the  direct,  practical  importance  for  the  emerging 
science  of  autonomously  developing,  “self-forming”  systems  of  various  origins.  First  of  all,  the 
proposed  theory  of  unreduced,  reality-based  dynamic  complexity  in  terms  of  dynamically 
multivalued  entanglement  of  interacting  system  components  appears  to  be  indispensable  for  any 
useful understanding of self-formation processes and cannot be replaced in this case by any unitary 
(dynamically  single-valued) imitation. Second, one cannot, and should not, avoid the true, dynamic 
randomness in the system behaviour, based on the irreducible dynamic multivaluedness of the driving 
interaction  process  and  playing  the major, creative role in the system structure formation (see Ref. 
[2] for the detailed application to popular cases of quantum computation and nanotechnology). And 
finally, the unified, universally confirmed law of conservation (symmetry) of complexity shows that 
every “miracle” of new structure emergence is always obtained at a well-defined, corresponding cost, 
and one can get only those “self”-organised structures that have been properly conceived in terms of 
the driving interaction parameters (in accord with the above rigorous interaction analysis).

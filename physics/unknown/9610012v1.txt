Abstract — We have developed a new family of limited diffraction electromagnetic

X-shaped waves based on the scalar X-shaped waves discovered previously. These

waves are diffraction-free in theory and particle-like (wave packets),

in that they

maintain their shape as they propagate to an inﬁnite distance. The “X waves” possess

(theoretically) inﬁnitely extended “arms” and —at least, the ones studied in this paper—

have an inﬁnite total energy:

therefore, they are not physically realizable. However,

they can be truncated in both space and time and “approximated” by means of a ﬁnite

aperture radiator so to get a large enough depth of interest (depth of ﬁeld). In addition

to the Maxwell equations, X wave solutions to the free Schroedinger equation are also

obtained. Possible applications of these new waves are discussed. Finally, we discuss

the appearance of the X-shaped solutions from the purely geometric point of view of

the special relativity theory.

I. — INTRODUCTION

“Limited diffraction” beams were discovered as early as 1941 by Stratton[1] and

rediscovered by Durnin in 1987 [2,3]. These beams have an inﬁnite depth of ﬁeld, i.e.,

they can propagate to an inﬁnite distance without changing their wave shape. Durnin

termed these beams “nondiffracting beams”[2] or “diffraction-free beams”[3]. Because

Durnin’s terminology is controversial, we used the term “limited diffraction beams”

based on the fact that in practice all beams will diffract eventually[4,5]. Durnin’s

beams are also called Bessel beams because their transverse beam proﬁle is a Bessel

function[2]. Bessel beams are monochromatic and are obtained by treating the (scalar)

amplitude related to one transverse component only of either the electric or the magnetic

ﬁeld of light as a solution to the scalar wave equation[2]. Theoretically, the limited

diffraction beams considered in this paper have an inﬁnite total energy; moreover they

would require an inﬁnite aperture radiator to be produced. In reality, however, these

beams can be truncated in both space and time and can be “approximated” by means

of a ﬁnite aperture radiator so to get a large enough depth of interest (a large ﬁeld

depth)[3]. Because of this property, limited diffraction beams could have applications

in medical imaging[4–14], tissue characterization[15], Doppler velocity estimation[16],

non-destructive evaluation of materials[17], and other related physics areas such as

electromagnetism[18–20] and optics[2,3,21], besides —possibly— geophysics (seismic

waves) and even gravitational wave detection (see the following).

Because limited diffraction beams have many potential applications, they have

been studied extensively in recent years in both acoustics[22–35] and optics[2,3,21].

Recently, we have discovered a new family of limited diffraction beams[36]. These

2

beams have been called “X waves” because they are X-shaped in a plane passing through

the propagation axis (r

z plane)[37–39]. The X-shaped waves are different from the

Bessel beams[36] because they contain multiple frequencies and are nondispersive in

isotropic-homogeneous media or free space (Bessel beams are “limited diffraction” at

a single frequency, but become dispersive for multiple frequencies because the phase

velocity of each frequency component is different[9]); moreover, the X-shaped waves

are Superluminal[36,37,40—42], i.e., have Superluminal group velocities, while Bessel

beams are subluminal as it will be shown elsewhere.

In cylindrical coordinates, limited diffraction beams propagating along the z axis

can be written in the following form

(cid:8)(r; (cid:30); z

c1t);

(1)

where r; (cid:30); z; and t represent the radial distance, polar angle, axial distance, and time,

respectively, (cid:8) represents acoustic pressure, velocity potential, or Hertz potential, z

c1t

is a propagation term, and c1 is the velocity of the beam. Because the variables, z and

t, appear only in the propagation term in eq.(1), limited diffraction beams are only a

function of r and (cid:30) if z

c1t = constant, i.e., traveling with the beam at the speed of c1,

one sees a constant beam pattern. This is different from conventional focused beams[43]

and localized waves studied by Brittingham[18] and other investigators[19–20,44].

In this paper, we will extend the theory of limited diffraction beams to electromag-

netic waves. X-shaped wave solutions to the free Maxwell and the free Schroedinger

equations will be obtained.

is coupled with the others through

the Maxwell equations (2)-(5). Because of the coupling of the components,

it is

difﬁcult to solve eqs.(8) and (9) directly. However, in some cases such as optics

and microwaves[46], the equations can be simpliﬁed, i.e., only the scalar amplitude of

one transverse component of either

or

is considered and any other components of

interest are treated independently in a similar fashion (treating light and microwaves as a

scalar phenomenon). This is approximately true under the following conditions[46]: (i)

the diffracting aperture must be large compared with a wavelength, and (ii) the diffracted

ﬁelds must not be observed too close to the aperture. In this case, limited diffraction

beams developed in acoustics[4–20] can be directly applied to electromagnetism because

they share the same wave equation. This was veriﬁed experimentally in optics by

Durnin for Bessel beams[3].

C. Hertz Vector Potential

Another way to solve the Maxwell equations is to use a Hertz vector potential. This

approach is rigorous as opposed to the scalar method above.

Because of eq.(4), the electric ﬁeld strength can be written[20]

= (cid:22)0

(cid:4)m;

@
@t

(10)

where (cid:4)m = (cid:8) o; is the magnetic Hertz vector potential where

o represents a unit

vector. This implies that the electromagnetic wave given by eq.(4) is a TE polarization

wave that is perpendicular to

o (for TM polarization, the analysis is similar). From

5

eq.(3), we obtain

=

(

(cid:4)m):

(11)

By inserting eq.(10) into eq.(2), and using eq.(11) and the Lorentz condition,

(cid:4)m =

fm [(cid:4)m is not unique:

i.e., different (cid:4)m may all give the same

and

from

eqs.(10) and (11), respectively], where fm is any differentiable scalar function, one

obtains the wave equation that the magnetic Hertz vector potential must satisfy:

2(cid:4)m

1
c2

@2(cid:4)m
@t2 = 0:

From eqs.(10), (11) and (12), we obtain

and

that solve eqs.(6) and (7), respectively.

If we use cylindrical coordinates and let

o = o, where

o is a unit vector along

the z axis, from eqs.(10) and (11) we get

and where

From eq.(15), eqs.(6) and (7) can be solved.

D. Limited Diffraction Solutions to Maxwell Equations

6

Equation (6) or (7) can either be solved approximately by treating each component

of the vectors independently, or by using the Hertz vector potential. However, the

solutions are not necessarily limited diffraction. In the following, we will show how

to obtain limited diffraction solutions.

From eqs.(10) and (11), we see that

and

are related to (cid:8) by derivatives of

its variables, r; (cid:30); z; and t, respectively. This means that if (cid:8) is a limited diffraction

solution to eq.(15), the solution to the Maxwell wave equations is also limited diffrac-

tion. This is because the derivatives with respect to the variables do not change the

propagation term, z

c1t.[4] If the scalar method is used, it is straightforward to obtain

limited diffraction solutions because each scalar component of

or

satisﬁes the

same equation as (cid:8) (eqs.(8) and (9)). Because of this, numerous limited diffraction

(relativistic) electromagnetic waves can be obtained from the scalar limited diffraction

(non-relativistic) beams studied in acoustics[4].

Families of generalized solutions of eq.(15) were discovered recently[36]. One of

the families of solutions is given by[36]:

(cid:8)(cid:16) (s) =

T (k)

A((cid:18))f (s)d(cid:18) dk;

s = (cid:11)0(k; (cid:16))r cos ((cid:30)

(cid:18)) + b(k; (cid:16))[z

c1(k; (cid:16))t];

(17)

where

and where

c1(k; (cid:16)) = c

1 + [(cid:11)0(k; (cid:16))=b(k; (cid:16))]2:

(18)

T (k) is any complex function (well behaved) of k and could include the temporal

frequency transfer function of a practical acoustic transducer or electromagnetic antenna,

7

A((cid:18)) is any complex function (well behaved) of (cid:18) and represents a weighting function of

the integration with respect to (cid:18), quantity f (s) is any complex function (well behaved)

of s, (cid:11)0(k; (cid:16)) and b(k; (cid:16)) are any complex function of k and (cid:16), c is the speed of sound

or light in eq.(15), k and (cid:16) are variables that are independent of the spatial position,

= (r cos (cid:30); r sin (cid:30); z); and time, t, and (cid:16) is an Axicon angle (0 < (cid:16) < (cid:25)=2)[36].

If c1(k; (cid:16)) in eq.(18) is real, “±” in eq.(17) represent forward and backward

propagating waves, respectively (in the following analysis, we consider only the forward

propagating waves and all results will be the same for the backward propagating waves).

Furthermore, (cid:8)(cid:16)(s) will represent a family of limited diffraction waves if c1(k; (cid:16)) is

independent of k (containing the same propagation terms, z

c1((cid:16))t, for all frequency

components, k).

It must be noticed that (cid:8)(cid:16) (s) in eq.(16) is very general.

It contains some of

the limited diffraction solutions known previously, such as: the plane wave, Durnin’s

limited diffraction beams and the limited diffraction portion of the Axicon beam, in

addition to an inﬁnity of new beams[36].

III. — ELECTROMAGNETIC X-SHAPED WAVES

In this Section, we will derive novel limited diffraction electromagnetic X-shaped

waves from eq.(16) by the Hertz vector potential, (cid:4)m = (cid:8) o, and by eqs.(13) and (14).

A. X-Shaped Wave Solutions

Let T (k) = B(k)e(cid:0)

a0k, A((cid:18)) = inein(cid:18), (cid:11)0(k; (cid:16)) = ik sin (cid:16), b(k; (cid:16)) = ik cos (cid:16),

and f (s) = es in eq.(16); we obtain an nth-order scalar limited diffraction X wave that

8

has an “X-like” shape in a plane passing through the propagation axis (r

z plane)[36],

(cid:8)Xn(r; (cid:30); z

c1t)

= ein(cid:30)

B(k)Jn(kr sin (cid:16))e(cid:0)

(cid:0)

k[a0

i cos (cid:16)(z

c1t)]dk; (n = 0; 1; 2; :::);

(cid:0)

(19)

0

where B(k) is any function (well behaved) of k and represents a transfer function of an

acoustic transducer or electromagnetic antenna, Jn( ) is the nth-order Bessel function

of the ﬁrst kind, c1 = c= cos (cid:16), k = !=c, ! is the angular frequency, a0 > 0 and

0

(cid:16) < (cid:25)=2 are constants.

If B(k) = a0, from eq.(19) we have the nth-order broadband X wave[36],

(cid:8)X BBn(r; (cid:30); z

c1t) =

(n = 0; 1; 2; :::);

(20)

where the subscript “BB” means “broadband,” and M = (r sin (cid:16))2 + (cid:28) 2, and where

(cid:28) = a0

i cos (cid:16)(z

c1t).

If B(k) is a band-limited function, we obtain an nth-order band-limited X wave that

is a convolution of functions (cid:0)

=a0 and (cid:8)XBBn (r; (cid:30); z

c1t) with respect to

Substituting eq.(20) into eqs.(13) and (14), one obtains an nth-order broadband

limited diffraction electromagnetic X wave:

( XBBn)r =

(cid:28) + n M (cid:8)XBBn ;

n(cid:22)0c

):

Because Maxwell equations are linear, both real and imaginary parts of their solutions

are also solutions. In the following, we consider the real part only.

B. Poynting Flux and Energy Density

From eqs.(22)-(26), one obtains the Poynting ﬂux,

XBBn = Re

The total energy of the nth-order limited diffraction electromagnetic X waves is

which is inﬁnite because the decay of the energy density along the X branches[4,36]

density and can be approximately produced with a ﬁnite aperture and energy over large

distance of interest (large depth of ﬁeld)[37].

C. An Example

In the following, we give an example of electromagnetic X-shaped wave. For

simplicity, only the zeroth-order (n = 0) X wave is considered. Notice that for n = 0,

eqs.(20)-(26) are axially symmetric (not a function of (cid:30)), and ( XBBo)r, ( XBBo)(cid:30),

and ( XBBo)(cid:30) are zero.

The real part of the zeroth-order scalar Hertz potential (eq.(20)) and the electro-

magnetic X waves (eqs.(23),(24) and (26)) are shown in Fig.1. The Poynting ﬂux and

energy density are shown in Fig.2. Their maxima and minima are summarized in Tables

I and II, respectively. From Table I, we see that, with the parameters given in Fig.1,

the electromagnetic X waves are almost transverse waves where their axial components

are much smaller than those of the transverse components. This is also shown in Table

II where the axial component of the Poynting ﬂux is at least four orders larger than

its lateral components. Lateral line plots of Figs.1 and 2 along X branches are shown

in Fig.3.

IV. — FINITE APERTURE APPROXIMATION

OF X-SHAPED WAVES AND DEPTH OF FIELD

Limited diffraction electromagnetic X waves obtained from eqs.(10) and (11) are

exact solutions to the free-space Maxwell wave equations.

In these equations, there

are no boundary conditions and thus the apertures required to produce the waves are

11

inﬁnite; in addition, the waves have an inﬁnite total energy (eq.(31)); therefore, they

cannot be realized with physical devices. However, these waves can be approximated

very well over a large depth of ﬁeld by truncating them in both space and time[36,37].

It is important to notice that the peaks of the truncated X waves move (Superluminally

and) almost rigidly along their motion direction over a large depth of interest, without

any further support from the antenna.

Because

X BBn(r; (cid:30); z

c1t) << XBBn(r; (cid:30)) and

XBBn(r; (cid:30); z

c1t) <<

XBBn(r; (cid:30))

for z

c1t > dz=2 within a ﬁnite transverse aperture, where dz

is a constant, X waves can be truncated within an axially moving “window”,

[c1t

dz=2; c1t + dz=2]. The truncated waves do not meet the problems of the theo-

retical (inﬁnitely extended) ones; for instance, at the aperture surface (z = 0) one can

always set a new time frame t0 = t + (dz=2)=c1 that starts from t0 = 0.

If the diameter of the aperture is D, the depth of ﬁeld (deﬁned as the maximum

axial distance within which the decrease of the wave magnitude is less than 6-dB with

respect to their peak at the aperture surface) of the X wave Hertz potential (eqs.(20)

and (21)) is given by[4,6,26,36]

Zmax =

(32)

Because the derivatives in eqs.(10) and (11) do not change the Axicon angle, (cid:16), the

depth of ﬁeld of the electromagnetic X waves produced by the same aperture are the

same as that of the Hertz potential. In addition, eq.(32) is also valid for band-limited

electromagnetic X waves[4,31]. As an example, if the diameter of the aperture is 20 m

and the Axicon angle, (cid:16), is 0.005(cid:14), the depth of ﬁeld of both broadband and band-limited

electromagnetic X waves is 115 km. Simulation[36] of a ﬁnite aperture X wave Hertz

12

potential with the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction formula[46] and its production[37]

with an acoustic transducer have been reported in our previous papers.

V. — X WAVE SOLUTIONS TO THE FREE SCHROEDINGER EQUATION

In addition to Maxwell equations, there are limited diffraction solutions also —for

instance— to the Schroedinger wave equation. These solutions are localized and particle

like. They may very well be related to the wave nature of quantum particles (cf. also

[47]).

wave equation is given by [48]

(cid:11)0(k; (cid:16)) and b(k; (cid:16)) in eq.(36) are any functions of the free parameters k and (cid:16), where

we assume that k = 2(cid:25)=(cid:21) is wave number and (cid:21) is wavelength. Let

that in the time-independent case the Helmholtz equation and the Schroedinger equation

are formally identical[49] (one important consequence of it being that evanescent wave

become actually different, but nevertheless strict relations still hold between some

solutions of theirs, as it will be explicitly shown elsewhere.

VI. — DISCUSSION

A. - X Wave Hertz Potential

The scalar X-shaped waves, (cid:8)XBBn, in eq.(20) satisﬁes the wave equation (15).

It is the component of a Hertz vector potential in the z direction. If n = 0, quantity

(cid:8)XBBn is axially symmetric and has a single peak at the wave center. For n > 0, it

is zero on the z axis and is axially asymmetric. When both n and (cid:16) are zero, (cid:8)XBBn

represents a plane wave. In this case,

and

derived from eqs.(10) and (11) should

be zero. The Hertz potential, (cid:8)XBBn, which may or may not have a physical meaning,

is used as an auxiliary function from which new electromagnetic X waves (eqs.(13)

and (14)) are derived.

If (cid:8)XBBn is treated approximately as one component of

or of

in eqs.(6) or

(7), respectively, it has a physical meaning. Many microwave and optical phenomena

are treated this way under suitable conditions[46]. A J0 Bessel beam (a special case of

X waves[36]) that was treated as one component of the electric ﬁeld strength of light

was produced by Durnin in an optical experiment[3]. In acoustics, (cid:8)XBBn represents

acoustic pressure or velocity potential[50,51], and has been approximated by a ﬁnite

aperture acoustic transducer[37] over a large depth of ﬁeld.

B. - Nth-order Electromagnetic X Wave

16

From the Hertz potential, (cid:4)m = (cid:8) o, and eqs.(10) and (11), a family of

electromagnetic X waves can be obtained (eqs.(22)-(26)). The nonnegative integer

n represents in these equations the order of the waves. Because the variable (cid:30) appears

in (cid:8)X BBn only,

and

have the same axial symmetry as (cid:8)XBBn . However, for

n = 1,

and

are not zero on the axis, z, and they are not axially symmetric. This

means they are not single-valued on the z axis and thus cannot be approximated with

a physical device.

For some components of the electromagnetic X waves the ﬁeld on the axial axis,

z, is zero. In such a case, there are multiple peaks around the X wave center, and the

energy density is high on these peaks. For example, the energy density of the zeroth-

order electromagnetic X wave has four sharp peaks (see Panel (3) of Fig.2). This is

similar to the case of Ziolkowski’s localized electromagnetic wave[20]. Notice that any

higher-order (n > 0) scalar X-shaped waves are zero on the z axis and also produce

multiple peaks[36].

in eqs.(49)-(50) or eqs.(52)-(53) may

D. - Limited Diffraction and Wave Speed

Because

or

in eqs.(13)-(14), (49)-(50), or (52)-(53) are obtained by derivatives

of the scalar X waves in terms of their spatial and time variables, the propagation term,

z

c1t, is retained after the derivatives. Therefore, the electromagnetic X-shaped waves

are also limited diffraction beams (traveling with the wave at speed c1, one will see a

constant wave pattern in space).

18

The wave speed, c1, of limited diffraction beams (eq.(1)) along the z axis is

greater than or equal to the speed of sound (in acoustics) or the speed of light (in

electromagnetism or optics). For example, the speed of the X-shaped waves is[36]

c1 = c= cos (cid:16)

c, where 0

(cid:16) < (cid:25)=2 is an Axicon angle[52]. This behavior is said to

be “tachyonic” or Superluminal[53] and has been studied by many investigators in both

“particle”[54–57] and wave [54,55,57,40–42,36] physics.

In particular, recently (see

e.g. refs.[40,41]) it has been claimed that all relativistic (homogeneous) wave equations

admit also sub- and Super-luminal solutions: a claim later conﬁrmed, e.g., in [57] (and

that in the past had been veriﬁed only in some particular cases[54]).

Although the theoretical Superluminal waves encountered in this paper cannot

be exactly produced, due to their inﬁnite energy, they can be approximated with a

ﬁnite aperture radiator and retain the essential characteristics (limited diffraction and

Superluminal group velocity) over a large depth of ﬁeld[36]. Each component (wavelet)

of the approximated wave propagates at the speed of sound or of light, but the cone,

or X-shaped wave, created by their superposition travels at a speed greater than the

sound or light speed. The X waves, however, do not appear to violate[36,37,54,55] the

special theory of relativity, as we shall discuss below in Section VII, when we shall

also show that Superluminal X-shaped waves, in particular, are predicted by Relativity

itself[53,54] to travel in space rigidly, without deforming.

Since Superluminal motions seem to appear even in other sectors of experimental

science, we deem it proper to present in an Appendix at the end of this paper some

information about those experimental results. In fact, the subject of Superluminal objects

[or tachyons] addressed in this paper is still unconventional, and it can get more support

from experiments than from theory. Moreover, such pieces of information are presently

19

scattered in four different areas of science, and it can be useful to ﬁnd them all collected

in one and the same place.

E. - Electric and Magnetic Field Strength Vectors

For the electromagnetic X waves given by eqs.(22)-(26), ( XBBn)(cid:30)=( XBBn)r or

( XBBn)(cid:30)=( XBBn)r is not a function of r and (cid:30). In addition, the z component of

is very small as compared to the other two components (see Table I). This means

that the major component of the Poynting ﬂux (eqs.(27)-(29)) is in the z direction (the

direction of the vector Hertz potential) (see Table II).

F. - Method to Obtain Other Limited Diffraction Electromagnetic Waves

It is clear from equations (13)-(14), (49)-(50), or (52)-(53), that when new limited

diffraction solutions to eq.(15) are found, the corresponding limited diffraction electro-

magnetic waves can be obtained. There are many ways to obtain new limited diffraction

solutions to the scalar wave equation, such as the variable substitution method, that con-

verts any existing solutions to a limited diffraction solution[24]; and the superposition

method, that uses Bessel beams or rather X waves as basis functions to construct limited

diffraction beams of practical usefulness[6,26].

G. - Bowtie X Waves for Sidelobe Reduction

Sidelobes of the scalar X-shaped waves (eq.(19)) are high along the X branches[4].

The asymptotic behavior of the electromagnetic X wave sidelobes are similar to that

of the scalar waves (see Figs.1 and 2). Low sidelobes are necessary to obtain high

contrast medical imaging where the biological soft tissues are modeled as multiple

20

random scatterers[51]. To reduce sidelobes of the scalar X waves in pulse-echo

imaging, a summation-subtraction method[31] can be used. However, this method

reduces the frame rate in real-time pulse-echo imaging, and is also sensitive to object

motion. Recently, unsymmetrical limited diffraction beams such as bowtie X waves

were developed[4]. These waves are obtained by taking derivatives in one direction,

say y, of the zeroth-order X wave. When a bowtie X wave is used to transmit and its

90(cid:14) rotated beam pattern (around the z axis) is used to receive, sidelobes of pulse-echo

imaging systems can be reduced dramatically without compromising the image frame

rate. The same technique could also be applied to the electromagnetic X-shaped waves

for low sidelobe imaging.

H. - Total Energy, Energy Density, and Causality

Because of the slow decay of the ﬁeld along the X branches, the total energy

(eq.(31)) of the abovementioned electromagnetic X-shaped waves is inﬁnite. In addition,

such waves should already exist at t =

, due to the inﬁnite extension of the X

arms. Therefore, theoretical (inﬁnitely extended) electromagnetic X waves are not

experimentally realizable. However, because the energy density of the electromagnetic

X waves is everywhere ﬁnite (except for those discussed in subsection C of this Section),

these waves can be approximated very well over a large depth of interest (depth of ﬁeld)

by truncating them in both aperture (transverse plane) and axial range[36,37,58]. The

truncated waves are “causal”, in the sense that they do not meet the above problems.

I. - Possible Applications

Because limited diffraction electromagnetic waves can be approximated over a

21

large depth of ﬁeld with a zero diffraction angle,

they could have applications in

acoustics[4–17], electromagnetism[18–20], and optics[2,3,21].

J. - Particle Like Character

Limited diffraction X waves (eq.(19) and (41)) are particle like. As the scaling

parameter, a0, decreases, the wave-function energy density around the wave center

increases. The off-center energy density of the X-shaped waves decays slowly along

the X branches, which may provide a way to communicate with other wave particles[58].

Let us also notice that the X-shaped waves considered by us are not normalizable, like

the plane wave solution[48] to the free Schroedinger equation.

VII. — A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK WITHIN

SPECIAL RELATIVITY FOR THE “X-WAVES”

Let us here mention that a simple theoretical framework exists[54] (merely based

on the space-time geometrical methods of Special Relativity (SR)) which incorporates

the Superluminal X-shaped waves without violating the Relativity principles.

Actually, SR can be derived from postulating: (i) the Principle of relativity; and (ii)

space-time to be homogeneous and space isotropic. It follows that one and only one

invariant speed exists; and experience shows that invariant speed to be the one, c, of

light in vacuum (the essential role of c in SR is just due to its invariance, and not to its

being supposedly a maximal, or minimal, speed; no other, sub- or Super-luminal, object

can be endowed with an invariant speed: in other words, no bradyon or tachyon can play

in SR the same essential role as the speed-c light waves). Let us recall, incidentally,

22

that tachyon [a term coined in 1967 by G.Feinberg] and bradyon [term coined in 1970

by one of the present authors] mean Superluminal and subluminal object, respectively.

The speed c turns out to be a limiting speed: but any limit possesses two sides, and

can be approached a priori both from below and from above (as E.C.G.Sudarshan put

it, from the fact that no one could climb over the Himalayas ranges, people of India

cannot conclude that there are no people North of the Himalayas...; actually, speed-c

photons exist, which are born, live and die just “at the top of the mountain,” without

any need to accelerate from rest to the light speed).

A consequence is that the quadratic form ds2 = c2dt2

dx2

dy2

dz2 (i.e., the

four-dimensional length-element square, along the space-time path of any object) results

to be invariant, except for its sign. In correspondence with the positive (negative) sign,

one gets the subluminal (Superluminal) Lorentz transformations [LT]. The ordinary,

subluminal LTs leave, e.g., the fourvector squares and the scalar products (between

fourvectors) just invariant.

The Superluminal LTs can be easily written down only in two dimensions (or in six,

or in eight, dimensions...). But they must have the properties of changing sign, e.g., to

the fourvector squares and to the fourvector scalar products. This is enough to deduce

—see Fig.4— that a particle, which is spherical when at rest (and which appears then as

ellipsoidal, due to Lorentz contraction, at subluminal speeds v), will appear[53,54,58,59]

as occupying the cylindrically symmetrical region bounded by a two-sheeted rotation

hyperboloid and an indeﬁnite double cone, as in Fig.4(d), for Superluminal speeds V.

In Fig.4 the motion is along the x-axis. In the limiting case of a point-like particle, one

obtains only a double cone. In 1982, therefore, it was predicted[53] that the simplest

Superluminal object appears (not as a particle, but as a ﬁeld or rather) as a wave:

23

namely, as a “X-shaped wave”, the cone semi-angle (cid:11) being given (with c = 1) by

cot (cid:11) = V 2

1.

It was also predicted[53,59] that the X-shaped waves would move rigidly with

speed V along their motion direction (Fig.5). The reason for such “X-waves” to travel

undeformed is quite simple: every X-wave can be regarded at each instant of time as

the (Superluminal) Lorentz transform of a spherical object, which of course as time

elapses moves in vacuum without any deformation.

The X-shaped waves here considered are the most simple ones only. If we started

not from an intrinsically spherical or point-like object, but from a non-spherically

symmetric particle, or from a pulsating (contracting and dilating) sphere, or from a

particle oscillating back and forth along the motion direction, their Superluminal Lorentz

transforms would result to be more and more complicated. The above-seen X-waves,

however, are typical for a Superluminal object, so as the spherical or point-like shape

is typical for a subluminal particle.

The three dimensional picture of Fig.5, or rather of Fig.4(d), appears in Fig.6, where

its annular intersections with a transverse plane are shown (cf. refs.[53,59]).

It has been believed for a long time that Superluminal objects would have allowed

sending information into the past; but such problems with causality seem to be solvable

within SR. Once SR is generalized in order to include tachyons, no signal traveling

backwards in time is apparently left. For a solution of those causal paradoxes, see

refs.[55,56] and references therein.

Let us pass, within this elementary context, to the problem of producing a “X-

shaped wave” like the one depicted in Fig.6 (truncated of course, in space and in time,

by use of a ﬁnite antenna radiating for a ﬁnite time interval). To convince ourselves

24

about the possibility of realizing them, it is enough to consider naively the ideal case of

a Superluminal source S of negligible size, endowed with constant speed V and emitting

spherical electromagnetic waves W (each one traveling at the invariant speed c). We

shall observe the electromagnetic waves to be internally tangent to an enveloping cone C

having the source motion line x as its axis and S as its vertex. This is analogous to what

happens with an airplane moving with a constant supersonic speed in the air. In addition,

those electromagnetic waves W interfere negatively one another inside the cone C, and

interfere constructively only on its surface. We can put a plane detector orthogonal to x

and record the intensity of the waves W impinging on it, as a (cylindrically symmetric)

function of position and of time. Afterwards, it will be enough to replace the plane

detector by a plane antenna that radiates —instead of detecting and recording— exactly

the same (cylindrically symmetrical) space-time pattern of electromagnetic waves W, in

order to build up a cone-shaped (C) electromagnetic wave travelling along x with the

Superluminal speed V (obviously, with no radiating source —now— any longer at its

vertex S). Even if each spherical wave W will still travel with the invariant speed c.

Incidentally, by evaluation of the above-mentioned intensity, one can get the

simplest example of “X-waxe solution.”

Let us recall by the way that, in the approximated case in which we produce a

ﬁnite conic wave truncated both in space and in time, the theory of SR suggested the

bi-conic shape (symmetrical in space with respect to the vertex S) to be a priori a better

approximation to a rigidly traveling wave; so that SR suggests to have recourse to

an antenna emitting a radiation (not only cylindrically symmetrical in space but also)

symmetric in time, in order to obtain a priori a better approximation to an undeformed

progressive wave.

25

Let us mention moreover that our ﬁnite bi-conic, or X-shaped, waves (after having

been produced) are expected to travel almost rigidly, at Superluminal speed, without

any further support from the radiator.

One may observe, at last, that in the vacuum and in nondispersive media for our

X-shaped waves the group velocity coincides with the phase velocity.

VIII. — CONCLUSION

We have derived limited diffraction solutions to the free Maxwell equations. Theo-

retically, these solutions are diffraction-free. They are inﬁnitely extended in space and

time, and possess inﬁnite total energy. However, for solutions that are single valued and

non-singular (ﬁnite energy density), they can be approximated very well by a ﬁnite aper-

ture antenna over a large depth of interest. In addition, some X-shaped wave solutions

to the free Schroedinger equation are derived; which may be helpful for a better under-

standing of the relationship between waves and particles. Because limited diffraction

beams have a large depth of ﬁeld, they could have applications in several areas.

As explained in Sect.VI-D above, we use the present occasion to present in the

Appendix below some information about the other sectors of experimental science in

which Superluminal motions seem to appear.

X. — APPENDIX

In this Appendix we take the opportunity to present some sketchy information

—mainly bibliographical— about the other three (in total, four) sectors of experimental

science in which Superluminal motions seem to appear. In fact, as the “Superluminal”

topic is still controversial, a panoramic view of the overall experimental situation is

certainly useful, especially when it is considered that the related information, scattered

in very different Journals, is not all of easy access to everybody.

For the sake of brevity, in the references quoted in this Appendix the title of the

papers will be omitted.

The question of Superluminal objects or waves [tachyons] has a long story, starting

perhaps with Lucretius’ De Rerum Natura. Still in pre-relativistic times, let us recall

e.g.

the contributions by A.Sommerfeld.

In relativistic times, our problem started

to be tackled again essentially in the ﬁfties and sixties, in particular after the papers

by E.C.George Sudarshan et al., and later on by E.Recami, R.Mignani et al.

[who

27

by their numerous works at the beginning of the seventies rendered, by the way, the

terms sub- and Super-luminal of popular use], as well as by H.C.Corben and others (to

conﬁne ourselves to the theoretical researches). For references, one can check pages

162-178 in ref.[54], where about 600 citations are listed; or the large bibliographies by

V.F.Perepelitsa[60] and the book in ref.[61]. In particular, for the causality problems one

can see refs.[55,56] and references therein, while for a model theory for tachyons in

two dimensions one can be addressed to refs.[54,62]. The ﬁrst experiments looking

for tachyons were performed by T.Alvager et al.; some citations about the early

experimental quest for Superluminal objects being found e.g. in refs.[1,63].

The subject of tachyons is presently returning after fashion, especially because of

the fact that four different experimental sectors of physics seem to indicate the existence

of Superluminal objects: including —of course— the one dealt with in this and in other

papers of ours, which seems to us as being at the moment the most important sector.

Let us put forth in the following some brief information about the experimental results

obtained in such different science areas.

First: Negative Mass-Square Neutrinos

Since 1971 it was known that the experimental square-mass of muon-neutrinos re-

sulted to be negative[64]. If conﬁrmed, this would correspond (within the ordinary naive

approach to relativistic particles) to an imaginary mass and therefore to a Superluminal

speed; in a non-naive approach[54], i.e. within a Special Relativity theory extended

to include tachyons (Extended Relativity), the free tachyon “dispersion relation” (with

c = 1) becomes E2

2 = m2
0.

From the theoretical point of view, let us refer to [65] and references therein.

28

Recent experiments showed that also electron-neutrinos result to have negative

mass-square[66].

Second: Galactic “Mini-Quasars”

We refer ourselves to the apparent Superluminal expansions observed inside quasars,

some galaxies, and —as discovered very recently— in some galactic objects, prelim-

inarily called “mini-quasars”. Since 1971 in many quasars (and even a few galaxies)

apparent Superluminal expansions were observed [Nature, for instance, dedicated to

those observations a couple of its covers]. Such seemingly Superluminal expansions

were the consequence of the experimentally measured angular separation rates, once it

was taken into account the (large) distance of the sources from the Earth. From the

experimental point of view, it will be enough to quote the book [67] and references

therein.

[68].

The distance of those “Superluminal sources”, however, it is not well known; or,

at least, the (large) distances usually adopted have been strongly criticized by H.Arp et

al., who maintain that quasars are much nearer objects than expected: so that all the

above-mentioned data can no longer be easily used to infer (apparent) Superluminal

motions. However, very recently, galactic objects have been discovered, in which

apparent Superluminal expansions occur; and the distance of galactic objects can be

more precisely determined. From the experimental point of view, see in fact the papers

From the theoretical point of view, both for quasars and “mini-quasars”, see [69,54].

In particular, let us recall that a single Superluminal source of light would be observed:

(i) initially, in the phase of “optic boom” (analogous to the acoustic “boom” by an

29

aircraft that travels with constant super-sonic speed) as a suddenly-appearing, intense

source; (ii) later on, as a source which splits into TWO objects receding one from the

other with relative velocity V larger than 2c.

Third: Tunnelling photons = Evanescent waves

It is the sector that most attracted the attention of the scientiﬁc and non-scientiﬁc

press[70].

Evanescent waves were predicted [cf., e.g., ref.[54], page 158 and references

therein] to be faster-than-light. Even more, they consist in tunnelling photons: and

it was known since long time[71] that tunnelling particles (wave packets) can move

with Superluminal group velocities inside the barrier; therefore, due to the theoretical

analogies between tunnelling particles (e.g., electrons) and tunnelling photons[49], it

was since long expected that evanescent waves could be Superluminal.

The ﬁrst experiments have been performed at Cologne, Germany, by Guenter Nimtz

et al., and published in 1992. See refs.[72].

Other very famous experiments have been performed at Berkeley: see refs.[73].

Further experiments on Superluminal evanescent waves have been done at Flo-

rence[74]; while a last experiment (as far as we know) took place at Vienna[74].

From the theoretical point of view, see [71] and references therein; and [75].

Fourth: Superluminal motions in Electrical and Acoustical Engineering — The “X-

shaped waves”

This fourth sector, which this paper is contributing to, seems to be at the moment

30

(together with the third one) the most promising.

Starting with the pioneering work by H.Bateman, it became slowly known that all

the relativistic homogeneous wave equations —in a general sense: scalar, electromag-

netic and spinor— admit solutions with subluminal group velocities[76]. More recently,

also Superluminal solutions have been constructed for those homogeneous wave equa-

tions, in refs.[77,57] and quite independently in refs.[40-42]:

in some cases just by

applying a Superluminal Lorentz “transformation”[54,62]. It has been also shown that

an analogous situation is met even for acoustic waves, with the existence in this case

of “sub-sonic” and “Super-sonic” solutions[10,36]; so that one can expect they to exist,

e.g., also for seismic wave equations. More intriguingly, we may expect the same to

be true in the case of gravitational waves too.

Let us recall that the rigidly traveling Supersonic and Superluminal solutions found

in refs.[36,37] and in this paper —some of them already experimentally realized—

appear to be (generally speaking) X-shaped,

just as predicted in 1982 by Barut,

Maccarrone and Recami[53].

On this regard, from the theoretical point of view, let us quote pages 116-117, and

pages 59 (ﬁg.19) and 141 (ﬁg.42), of ref.[54]; and even more refs.[54,58,59], where

“X-shaped waves” are predicted and discussed. From such papers it is also clear why

the X-shaped waves keeps their form while traveling (nondiffracting waves).

Fig.1. Real part of Hertz potential and ﬁeld components of the zeroth-order (n = 0)

limited diffraction electromagnetic X wave at time t = z=c1. Panel (1) is Hertz

potential, Re (cid:8)XBB0

; Panel (2) is the (cid:30) component of electric ﬁeld strength,

Re ( XBB0)(cid:30)

; and Panels (3) and (4) are r and z components of magnetic ﬁeld

strength, Re ( XBB0)r

and Re ( XBB0)z , respectively. The dimension of each

panel is 4 m (r direction)

2 mm (z direction). The free parameters (cid:16) and a0 are

0.005(cid:14) and 0.05 mm, respectively. The values shown on the right-top corner of each

panel represent the maxima and the minima of the images before normalization for

display [MKSA units] (see also Table I).

Fig.2. Poynting ﬂux and energy density of the zeroth-order limited diffraction elec-

tromagnetic X wave at time t = z=c1. Panels (1) and (2) are r and z components of

the Poynting ﬂux, ( XBB0)r

and ( XBB0)z, respectively; and Panel (3) is the energy

density, UXBB0. The dimension of each panel and the parameters of the X waves are

the same as those in Fig.1. The values shown on the right-top corner of each panel

represent the maxima and the minima of the images before normalizing for display

[MKSA units] (see also Table II).

Fig.3. Line plots of the zeroth-order electromagnetic X wave in Figs.1 and 2 along

one of the “X” branches (from left bottom to top right). Panel (1) shows the line

plots of the ﬁeld components: Re (cid:8)XBB0

(full line), Re ( XBB0)(cid:30)

(dotted line),

Re ( XBB0)r

(dashed line), and Re ( XBB0)z

(long dashed line). Panel (2) is

42

the line plot of the Poynting ﬂux and energy density: ( XBB0)r (full line), ( XBB0)z

(dotted lines), and UXBB0 (dashed line).

Fig.4. Let us consider an object that is intrinsically spherical, i.e., that is a sphere

in its rest-frame (Panel (a)). After a generic subluminal Lorentz transformation (LT)

along x, i.e., under a subluminal x-boost, it is predicted by special relativity (SR) to

appear as ellipsoidal due to Lorentz contraction (Panel (b)). After a Superluminal x-

boost (namely, when this object moves with Superluminal speed V), it is predicted

by extended relativity (ER) to appear[53,54] as in Panel (d), i.e., as occupying the

cylindrically symmetric region bounded by a two-sheeted rotation hyperboloid and an

indeﬁnite double cone. The whole structure is predicted by ER to move rigidly and,

of course, with the speed V, the cone semi-angle cotangent square being (V =c)2

1.

Panel (c) refers to the limiting case when the boost-speed tends to c, either from the

left or from the right. (For simplicity, a space axis is skipped).

Fig.5. If we start from a spherical particle as in Fig.4(a), then —after a Superluminal

boost along a generic motion line l,— we obtain the tachyonic object T depicted in

this ﬁgure. Once more, the Superluminal object T appears to be spread over the whole

spatial region delimited by a double cone and a two-sheeted hyperboloid asymptotic to

the cone[59]. The whole structure travels of course along l with the speed V of the

Superluminal l-boost. Notice that, if the object is not spherical when at rest (but, e.g.,

is ellipsoidal in its own rest-frame), then the axis of T will no longer coincide with l,

but its direction will depend on the speed V of the tachyon itself. For the case in which

the space extension of the Superluminal object T is ﬁnite, see ref.[58].

43

Fig.6. Here we show the intersections of the Superluminal object T with planes P

orthogonal to its motion line x-axis, for the same case as in Fig.4. For simplicity,

we assumed again the object to be spherical in its rest-frame, and the cone vertex to

coincide with the origin O for t = 0. Such intersections evolve in time so that the same

pattern appears on a second plane —shifted by

x after the time

t = x=V . On

each plane, as time elapses, the intersection is therefore predicted by ER to be a circular

ring which, for negative times, goes on shrinking until it reduces to a circle and then to

a point (for t = 0); afterwards, such a point becomes again a circle and then a circular

ring that goes on broadening[53,54,59,58].

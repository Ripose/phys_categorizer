The  development  of  the  modern  accelerator  and  free-electron  laser  projects  requires  to 

consider wake fields of very short bunches in arbitrary three dimensional structures. To obtain 

the  wake  numerically  by  direct  integration  is  difficult,  since  it  takes  a  long  time  for  the 

scattered fields to catch up to the bunch. On the other hand no general algorithm for indirect 

wake field integration is available in the literature so far. In this paper we review the known 

indirect methods to compute wake potentials in rotationally symmetric and cavity-like three 

dimensional structures. For arbitrary three dimensional geometries we introduce several new 

techniques and test them numerically.

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

The  fast  growth  of  computer  power  allows  for  direct  time  domain  calculations  of  short-

range wake potentials for general three dimensional accelerator elements. However, for short 

bunches  a  long-time  propagation  of  the  electromagnetic  field  in  the  outgoing  vacuum 

chamber is required in order to take into account the scattered fields reaching the bunch later. 

To reduce drastically the computational time and to avoid the numerical error accumulation 

several indirect integration algorithms were developed for rotationally symmetric geometries 

[3-7]. For the general case in three dimensions such an algorithm is known only for cavity-

like structures [8]. In this paper we review the known methods and introduce new techniques 

which  allow  for  a  treatment  of  arbitrary  three  dimensional  structures.  Several  numerical 

examples are presented to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the described methods. 

 

 

 

 

II. FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM 

  At high energies the particle beam is rigid. To obtain the electromagnetic wake field, the 

Maxwell equations can be solved with a rigid particle distribution [1, 2]. The influence of the 

wake field on the particle distribution is neglected here; thus, the beam-surrounding system is 

not  solved  self-consistently  and  a  mixed  Cauchy  problem  for  the  situation  shown  in  Fig.  1 

should be considered. 

 

The  problem  reads  as  follows.  For  a  bunch  moving  at  velocity  of  light  c   and 

(cid:71) (cid:71)
characterized by a charge distribution  ρ find the electromagnetic field  E,H

 in a domain  Ω  

which is bounded transversally by a perfect conductor  ∂Ω . The bunch introduces an electric 

(cid:71)
current  j

The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  show  how  to  replace  the  improper  integrals  in  (2),  (3)  by 

proper  integrals.  This  is  essential  for  computer  calculations,  in  particular  for  short  bunches, 

where long beam tubes would require excessive computer memory and CPU time. 

 

In  the  following  only  integral  (2)  will  be  considered.    The  transverse  potential  can  be 

 

 

 

 

 

derived from the longitudinal one by applying the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem [17]

III. INDIRECT METHIODS FOR AXISYMMETRIC STRUCTURES 

For  rotationally  symmetric  structures,  an  azimuthal  Fourier  expansion  can  be  used  to 

reduce  the  problem  to  a  set  of  two  dimensional  problems.  For  cavity  like  structures  the 

integration of the wake fields can be performed along a straight line parallel to the axis at the 

outgoing beam tube radius as was suggested by T.Weiland in [4] and realized in codes BCI 

[10],  TBCI  [11]  and  MAFIA  [13].  However,  this  technique  works  only  if  no  part  of  the 

structure extends to a radius smaller than the radius of the outgoing tube. It has been realized 

later  [5,  6]  that  the  potential  can  be  calculated  by  integrating  the  wake  along  the  perfectly 

conducting boundary of a structure. Finally, O. Napoly et al [7] have generalized the above 

results by showing that the wake potentials, at all azimuthal harmonics  m , can be expressed 

as  integrals  over  the  wake  fields  along  any  arbitrary  contour  spanning  the  structure 

longitudinally.  This  general  method  was  implemented  and  tested  in  code  ABCI  [12].  A 

modified version of this method was introduced in paper [14] and implemented in code Echo. 

  An alternative approach based on waveguide mode expansion was introduced in [3] and 

realized in code DBCI.  

In  the  following  we  review  the  most  simple  and  general  method  of  Napoly  et  al.  and 

describe its modified version used later for the 3D case. 

A. Napoly-Chin-Zotter (NCZ) method  for arbitrary rotational symmetric structures 

with unequal beam tubes radii 

 

In this paper we consider only structures supplied with perfectly conducting ingoing and 

outgoing  waveguides.  The  steady-state  field  pattern  of  a  bunch  in  an  ingoing  perfectly 

conducting waveguide does not contribute to the wake potential. Hence the improper integral 

for  the  ingoing  waveguide  reduces  to  a  proper  integral  along  a  finite  part  of  the  integration 

path  and,  as  will  be  described  below,  the  NCZ  method  is  applicable  for  the  case  where  the 

ingoing and outgoing tubes have unequal radii (see Fig. 2). 

 

For a bunch moving at speed of light 

c

 at an offset 

 from and parallel to the axis of a 

0r

rotationally symmetric structure, the source current  

 can be presented as

that an integral of the closed form along a closed contour vanishes. This property allows to

B. Modification of the NCZ method 

 

In  this  paragraph  we  introduce  a  modification  of  the  NCZ  method.  The  main  feature  of 

our method is that (like in the direct method) we integrate only the 

(
ze

m

) ( ,

r z s
, )

 component of 

the scattered electromagnetic field along a straight line 

1C−  at radius 

0r

, and use other field 

components only at the end of the structure. This property of the method allows to apply it for 

3D calculations as described in section IV.B.

IV. INDIRECT METHODS FOR 3D STRUCTURES 

 

In  the  previous  chapter  a  general  solution  for  rotationally  symmetric  geometries  was 

described. However the NCZ method does not generalize to three dimensions. Following the 

same route it is easy to obtain closed 2-forms. However, wake potential (2) is a line integral 

and it cannot be treated through 2-forms. Hence, we have to look here for alternative methods. 

A. Method for cavity like structures or structures with small outgoing waveguide 

  As for the rotationally symmetric case the integration through a waveguide gap results in a

simple and efficient algorithm [8].

 holds and 

we  perform  the  integration  at  the  transverse  position  of  the  outgoing  waveguide  boundary 

⊥∂Ω

. The longitudinal wake potential for any position inside the waveguide is then obtained 

as a solution of  the Laplace equation (15) with Dirichlet boundary condition

However, this method does not work if the area 

 is smaller than the outgoing waveguide

. Below we suggest methods able to treat this situation. 

  

 

B. Method for general 3D structures with outgoing round pipe 

In this paragraph we consider the situation where an arbitrary three dimensional structure is 

supplied with a round outgoing pipe. In this case we can easily generalize our method (14) as 

follows.

Our  purpose  is  to  replace  the  second  improper  integral  by  proper  integrals.  This  can  be 

achieved by straightforward generalization of the method described in section III.B. 

 

Indeed,  after  the  bunch  arrived  in  the  round  pipe  we  can  use  an  azimuthal  Fourier 

expansion  to  reduce  the  3D  problem  to  set  of  2D  problems.  However,  unlike  in  the 

rotationally  symmetric  case  of  Section  III  the  electromagnetic  field  components  are  now 

complex quantities due to the fields scattered before by the 3D structure. 

 

Let us represent the scattered electromagnetic field

C.  Method based on the directional symmetry of wake potential 

The  methods  introduced  in  the  previous  sections  are  not  fully  general.  The  method  of 

section  IV.A allows to treat only structures where the crosssection of the outgoing waveguide 

is covered by any other crosssection along the structure. For example, if we are interested in 

the wake for the transition from a round pipe to a rectangular one, as shown in Fig.4, then this 

method does not work. The method of the section IV.B is not applicable directly, too.

Fig. 4. Round to rectangular transition and the maximal area for wakepotential calculation. 

  However, often we are able to apply one of the two methods when the bunch direction of 

motion is reversed. For example, the inverse transition from a rectangular to a round pipe can 

be treated with the method of section IV.B.  

In this section we describe a method which allows to calculate the wakepotential for one 

direction from the wakepotential for the reversed one.  

In [18] a directional symmetry of the impedance

  Hence,  in  order  to  find  the  wake  potential  of  the  round  to  rectangular  transition  we  can 

calculate the wakepotential of the inverse transition with the method of section IV.B. Then we 

need  to  calculate  fileds  (22)  in  both  pipe  cross-sections.  This  is  a two  dimensional  problem 

and can be solved either analytically or numerically.  Finally, we use equation (24) to obtain 

the required wakepotential. The numerical application of this method for the calculation of the 

wakes can be found in [19]. 

D. General method based on waveguide mode expansion 

 

In  this  section  we  present  a  general  method  for  arbitrary  3D  geometries.  The  method  is 

based on a waveguide mode expansion. The first attempt to use a waveguide mode expansion 

was  made  in  the  code  DBCI  for  monopole  and  dipole  azimuthal  modes  in  rotationally 

symmetric structures [3]. 

easily realized numerically. 

 

In  this  section  we  derive  a  method  for  the  general  three  dimensional  case.  Compared  to 

the considerations of  [3] the resulting algorithm exhibits much simpler equations which are 

The longitudinal component 

 of the scattered electric field in the outgoing waveguide 

zE

can be written as a linear combination of  the z-components of the TM waveguide modes [20]

  Note,  that  problem  (27)  is  a  two  dimensional  one  and  can  be  solved  by  an  eigenvalue 

solver for Laplace's equation. Additionally, the sum (28) converges relatively fast due to the 

( nO k −

2

)

 behavior of the summands. 

 

If  the  number  of  modes  in  equation  (28)  is  insufficient  then  applying  the  transverse 

gradient operator in the Panovsky-Wenzel theorem (4) will result in a non-smooth transverse 

behaviour of the transverse wakepotential. A simple and efficient way to resolve this problem 

is  to  use  the  harmonic  transverse  behaviour  of  the  longitudinal  wakepotential  (15).  Indeed, 

after we have calculated the longitudinal wakepotential with the help of the waveguide mode 

expansion  (28)  in  the  transverse  area 

⊥Ω   we  can  take  the  values  of  the  longitudinal 

wakepotential  on  the  boundary 

⊥∂Ω

  (or  near  to  it)  and  solve  the  Laplace  equation  (15)  in 

order  to  find  the  wakepotential  in  the  interior.  This  will  result  in  a  smooth  transverse 

behaviour  of  the  longitudinal  wakepotential  which  allows  to  calculate  the  transverse 

wakepotential accurately. 

 

 

 

V. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES 

In  this  section  we  present  several  numerical  tests  which  confirm  the  accuracy  and  high 

efficiency of the suggested indirect methods for wake potential integration. 

The wakes of the LCLS round-to-rectangular transition shown in Fig. 4 are calculated by 

the methods of Sections IV.B, C in reference [19]. Hence, we consider here only numerical 

tests for the most general indirect method described in section IV.D. 

  As  the  first  example  we  consider  the  round  stepped  collimator  shown  in  Fig.  3  with 

dimensions a=4mm, b=2.5mm and c=20mm.  The longitudinal wake potential for a Gaussian 

bunch moving along the axis with the RMS length 

σ =

20µm

 is shown in Fig. 5 on the left. 

We compare the wakes calculated by the direct method (see, equation (2)) against the wake 

potential calculated by the indirect method of section III.B. The direct wakes are obtained by 

integration of the longitudinal electric field component 

 at the radius 

r =

2.5mm

 along the 

zE

z-axis for different distances between 0.25 and 4 meters. This numerical check shows that the 

catch-up distance is more than 4 meters.  The above numerical results are obtained with the 

code Echo [14] in a rotationally symmetric geometry. In order to check the implementation of 

the  3D  indirect  method  of  section  IV.D  we  have  calculated  the  same  example  with  the  3D 

code [16]. For 3D calculations we used the same longitudinal mesh step as for the 2D code. 

For the waveguide mode expansion (28) we used 200 (general) modes. The comparison of 2D 

and 3D results is shown in Fig. 5 on the right. Additionally, we have found that the numerical 

results agree well with the analytical approximation for the stepped collimator [2].

Fig. 6. Rectangular collimator and its wake potential calculated with direct and indirect (Section IV.D) methods.  

  As the last example we consider a rectangular collimator shown in Fig. 6.  We compare 

the  wakepotentials  for  a  Gaussian  bunch  moving  along  the  axis  with  the  RMS  length 

σ =

200µm

, calculated by the direct method, and the wakepotential calculated by the indirect 

method  of  section  IV.D  (with  100  modes  in  the  waveguide  mode  expansion).    The  direct 

wakes are obtained for distances 0.25 and 1 meter after the collimator. We again see that the 

indirect method applied at 1 mm after the collimator yields the accurate result, which agrees 

with the direct calculation at 1 meter. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

VI. CONCLUSION 

In this paper we reviewed available and introduced new techniques for indirect integration 

of the wakepotential. The developed algorithms are checked numerically and their efficiency 

is confirmed by the solution of real accelerator problems [19, 21-22].

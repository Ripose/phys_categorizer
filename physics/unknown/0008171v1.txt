SLAC Linac RF Performance for LCLS*

R. Akre, V. Bharadwaj, P. Emma, P. Krejcik, SLAC, Stanford, CA 94025, USA

Phase  Reference  Line,  PRL,  that  carries  the  reference
signal to the Phase and Amplitude Detector, PAD, of the
eight klystrons in the sector.

Abstract

The  Linac  Coherent  Light  Source  (LCLS)  project  at
SLAC  uses  a  dense  15  GeV  electron  beam  passing
through a  long  undulator  to  generate  extremely  bright  x-
rays  at  1.5  angstroms.  The  project  requires  electron
bunches with a nominal peak current of 3.5kA and bunch
lengths  of  0.020mm  (70fs).  The  bunch  compression
techniques  used  to  achieve  the  high  brightness  impose
challenging  tolerances  on  the  accelerator  RF  phase  and
amplitude.  The  results  of  measurements  on  the  existing
SLAC  linac  RF  phase  and  amplitude  stability  are
summarised and improvements needed to meet the LCLS
tolerances are discussed.

1  LCLS RF REQUIREMENTS

LCLS  requires  the  SLAC  linac  to  perform  with
tolerances on RF phase and amplitude stability which are
beyond  all  previous  requirements.    The  LCLS  is  divided
into  four  linacs  L0,  L1,  L2,  and  L3  [1].    The  phase  and
amplitude  tolerances  for  the  four  linacs  operated  at  S-
Band, 2856MHz, are given in Table 1.

2  LINAC RF SYSTEM

2.1  The RF Distribution System

 Figure 1: SLAC linac RF station

 

The critical parameters for the short term and long term
variations in the RF phase and amplitude can be read back
through  the  existing  control  system.    The  phase  and
amplitude  from  the  output  of  the  SLED  energy  storage
cavity are compared and recorded by the PAD.  There are
three methods of acquiring and displaying the data:

•  The fast time plot gives 64 consecutive data points.

At 30Hz this is 2.1 seconds of data.

•  The correlation plot collects data with a maximum
frequency  of  about  1Hz  and  can  collect  up  to  512
data points.

 The  RF  distribution  and  control  systems  for  the  linac,
after  upgrades  15  years  ago[2]  for  the  SLAC  Linear
Collider(SLC) are shown in figure 1.  The RF distribution
system  consists  of  coaxial  lines  with  varying  degrees  of
temperature  stabilisation,  figure  1.    The  3.125  inch  rigid
coax Main Drive Line, MDL, carries 476MHz down the 2
miles of accelerator.  At the beginning of each of the 30
sectors the 476MHz is picked off and multiplied by  6  to
get  2856MHz.    There  is  a  temperature-stabilised  coaxial

† Throughout this paper °S, °F, and °C stand for degrees at 2856MHz, S-Band, degrees Fahrenheit, and Celsius respectively

The  bit  resolution  of  the  ADC  in  the  PAD  is  0.04°S.
Phase  and  amplitude  stability  has  been  measured  for  the
different time scales.

•  The  history  buffers  are  updated  with  a  data  point
every six minutes for the past week and every four
hours for the past 7 years.

2.2  RF Phase Stability

 Phase  fast  time  plots  have  an  rms  variation  of  0.05°S
and meet LCLS requirements on a two second time scale.
On  a  larger  time  scale  drifts  of  well  over  0.1°S  are
observed  as  temperature  of  the  regulating  water  and
environment  changes,  figure  2.    The  phase  correlation,
6°S/°F, is likely due to the high Q SLED cavity.

Center Klystron phase 14-minute time scale.  Bottom
SLED water temperature °F 14-minute time scale.
 During normal linac operation each klystron’s phase is
adjusted by a high power phase shifter to keep the phase
as read by the PAD within a few degrees of the set value.
The  phase  shifter  is  a  rotary  drum  type  and  typically
moves about a dozen times a day by a stepper motor.  The
resolution of the phase shifter is 0.125°S, which is much
coarser than the short term phase variation seen on the fast
time plots.  The position of this phase shifter is recorded
in  history  buffers.    The  phase  shifter  movement  over  a
three-day  period  has  been  correlated 
to  outside
temperature  and  the  coefficients  listed  in  Table  2.    The
klystrons  are  grouped  according  to  their  position  within
the sector and averaged over the 29 sectors from sector 2

to  sector  30.    Position  1  is  closest  to  the  sub-booster
klystron and position 8 is at the end of the sector.  During
the  course  of  a  year  the  outside  temperature  varies  from
35°F to 95°F and as much as 35°F diurnally.

2.3  RF Phase Measurement Accuracy

 The critical phase stability of the RF with respect to the
beam  is  influenced  at  three  levels  within  the  RF
distribution  and  control  system.  The  first  level  is  the
stability of the phase reference system.  The second tier is
the  noise  level  and  drifts  associated  with  the  phase
measurement  electronics,  and  the  third  level  consists  of
the  errors  introduced  in  the  beam  phase  measurement
system.

 The two-mile MDL has been studied [3] and the length
electronically  measured  by  an  interferometer.    From
reference  [3] 
length  varies  with  pressure  and
temperature over the 2 miles as follows:

the 

 ∆φ(°S) ~ -2.64(∆P(mBar)) + 1.36(∆T(°F))

 History buffers show that the pressure range, ∆P, is about
30mBar,  which  gives  a  phase  variation  of  79°S.    The
temperature range, ∆T, of the MDL is about 30°F, half the
outside  ∆T  due  to  some  insulation  and  temperature
regulation.  This ∆T gives a phase variation of 41°S.  The
predicted  phase  variations  based  on  the  above  analysis
only accounts for about half the observed phase tuning in
the  linac  that  is  necessary  to  keep  the  beam  at  constant
phase  to  meet  the  beam  energy  and  energy  spread
requirements  [4].  These  additional  errors  indicate  the
system is in need of an upgrade.

 About  95%  of  the  PRL  is  temperature  controlled  with
an  rms  value  of  0.05°F.    The  other  5%  varies  by  about
10%  of  the  surrounding  temperature,  which  gives  a
temperature variation of about 1.0°F.  The ½ inch heliax
has a temperature coefficient of 4ppm/°C, 0.9°S/°F/sector.
The phase error is spread linearly from a minimum at the
first  klystron  in  the  sector  to  a  maximum  at  the  eighth
klystron in the sector.  The average phase variation of the
sector is ½ the phase variation of the PRL, 0.5°S.

 The  multipliers  are  temperature  stabilised  to  about
0.1°Frms  and  have  temperature  coefficients  which  range
from –1.7°S/°F to +2.2°S/°F.  The phase errors from the
multipliers are on the order of 0.2°S rms.

 Additional  errors  are  introduced  between  the  phase
reference system and the beam by the variations in length

due  to  temperature  of  the  accelerating  sections  and  the
waveguide feeding them.  These variations are ignored by
the  feedback  system  since  the  PAD  only  measures  the
signal  at  the  output  of  the  SLED  cavity.    Table  3
summarises  the  phase  errors  due  to  temperature  changes
in the system.  The dominant non-corrected error is due to
the accelerator structure temperature  change.    Measuring
the RF phase at the output or input of the structure as an
estimate for the phase of the structure as seen by the beam
would  have  an  error  of  0.8°S  rms,  or  half  the  phase
slippage of the structure.

 The measurement resolution of the PAD is good enough
to  meet  the  LCLS  requirements.    Initial  testing  show
measurement  drifts  of 
temperature
variations  to  be  close  to  LCLS  requirements.    Further
testing will be done to better estimate the PAD errors.
2.4  RF Amplitude Stability

the  PAD  from 

 Fast time plots for the klystron amplitude also show that
on  a  two  second  time  scale  the  LCLS  stability  criterion
can  be  met.    The  rms  amplitude  jitter  measured  by  the
PAD at the output of he SLED cavity is less than 0.04%
of the amplitude.  Correlation plots over a 14-minute time
scale show the amplitude varies by as much as 0.5% peak
to  peak. 
  This  change  is  correlated  to  the  water
temperature  of  the  SLED  cavity  and  the  magnitude  of
variations is greatly effected by the tune of the cavity[7].
Klystron  K02  on  the  SLAC  accelerator  has  a  slow
amplitude  feedback  and  no  SLED  cavity.    Measurement
of the amplitude variation over days is held to 0.06% rms.
Further  work  needs  to  be  completed  to  determine  how
stable  the  measurement  is  with  respect  to  temperature
changes.

Extremely 
tolerances
throughout  the  linac  are  required  to  meet  the  LCLS
specifications.  The LCLS requirements listed in Table 1
may still change as the design of the bunch compression
system evolves.  Measurement of the individual klystrons
show  that  they  are  capable  of  attaining  the  desired
specification  up  to  a  two  second  time  scale.    The
challenge is to link the many klystrons together through a
RF  distribution  system  and  preserve  the  stability  over
extended periods of time.

On  longer  time  scales  where  temperature  changes  are
significant,  a  new  RF  reference  and  distribution  system
located 
temperature
variations  less  than  0.1°F,  is  under  consideration.    The
new system will distribute 2856MHz to the klystrons and
provide  a  reference  for  phase  measurements  of  the
accelerator  RF  and  beam  phase  cavity  RF.    This  new
phase  system  is  expected  to  reduce  the  phase  drifts  and
errors along the kilometer linac from about 10°S down to
as  little  as  0.1°S.    Even  with  such  a  phase  stable  RF
reference  system,  measuring  the  phase  of  the  RF  at  the
input  or  output  of  the  accelerator  will  result  in  errors  of
0.8°Srms compared to the RF phase as seen by the beam
in  an  accelerator  structure  which  has 
temperature
variations of 0.1°Crms.  In order to hold the RF to beam
phase  to  0.1°S  a  feedback  system  using  a  beam-based
measurement is necessary.

Further  measurements  will  determine  if  the  existing
amplitude  measurement  and  control  system  with  added
feedback is sufficient to meet LCLS requirements.

 In LCLS L2 and L3, where there is a large number of
klystrons,  it  is  likely  that  the  phase  errors  will  be
correlated with water temperature which spans groups of
16  klystrons,  or  outside  temperature  and  pressure,  which
is  common  to  all.    The  larger  number  of  klystrons  does
not increase the tolerance of an individual klystron by √n.
     Further  testing  of  the  existing  RF  system  as  well  as
development  and  testing  of  new  systems  is  ongoing,  the
results of which will lead  to  the  design  of  the  LCLS  RF
system.

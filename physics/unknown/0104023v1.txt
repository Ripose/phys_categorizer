ABSTRACT

By using the maximum entropy principle with Tsallis entropy and under the assumption
that  the  gouge  plays  an  active  role  in  the  triggering  of  earthquakes,  we  obtain  a
functional dependence  for energy distribution function for  earthquakes which fits very
well  with  observations  in  the  region  of  small  energies.  This  distribution  function  is
related to the size distribution function of fragments in the gouge.

INTRODUCTION

The  Gutenberg-Richter  law  (1)  has  motivated  a  mass  of  research.  This  is  due  to  the
importance of the knowledge of the energy distribution of earthquakes and its physical
and practical implications. Some famous models like those of Burridge-Knopoff (2) and
Olami-Feder-Christensen  (3)  have  focused  in  the  mechanical  phenomenology  of
earthquakes through simples images which capture essentials of the nature and genesis
of  a  seism:  the  relative  displacement  of  tectonic  plates  or  the  relative  motion  of  the
hanging  wall  and  footwall  in  a  fault  and  also  the  existence  of  a  threshold  for  a
catastrophic release of energy in the system.

The irregular geometry of the profiles of the tectonic plates was highlighted in (4) using
a  geometric  viewpoint  to  deduce  the  power  law  dependence  of  earthquake  energy
distribution  with  good  results.  The  importance  of  a  geometric  viewpoint  for  this
phenomenon has been also highlighted in (5), where an idealized representation of the
fragmented core of a fault (gouge) was presented.

Today it is widely accepted that most earthquakes are originated by relative motion of
fault planes, whereas the images to model this energy release are diverse. The standard
earthquake picture usually assigns the cause of an earthquake to some kind of rupture or
some  stick-slip  mechanism  in  which  the  friction  properties  of  the  fault  play  the
determinant  role.  A  review  of  these  viewpoints  and  some  generated  paradoxes  can  be
found in (6).

Though  the  gouge  has  been  recognized  as  an  important  factor  in  the  dynamics  of  the
earth’s  crust,  we  think  that  its  role  is  more  active  in  small  faults  and  we  intend  to
corroborate this viewpoint in this paper.

In  (5)  the  gouge  was  idealized to be  a  medium  formed  by  circular  disk-shaped  pieces
filling the space between two planes acting like bearings. Here, we present a more

realistic approximation, considering that the surfaces of the tectonic plates are irregular
and the space between them contains fragments of very diverse shape.

We will present the geometric image of what we will call a “gouge earthquake” and in
next  sections  we  will  justify  the  attempt  to  find  the  size  distribution  function  of  the
fragments.  Finally,  we  will  compare  our  theoretical  results  with  the  earthquakes
registered  in  the  South  of  the  Iberian  Peninsula  (Spain).  The  Andalusian  Seismic
Network collects data and the analysis of its catalogue is extended for more than 20000
earthquakes (m < 5.5). In this study we analyze about 12000 earthquakes ranging from
0 magnitude to 2.5.

IMAGE FOR EARTHQUAKES IN THE GOUGE

The  abundance  of  models  that  manifest  the  catastrophic  mechanical  nature  of
earthquakes  is  expected  since  the  mechanism  of  earthquake  triggering,  although  not
well known, reveals itself as a catastrophic one.

The  irregularity  of  the  profiles  of  the  tectonic  plates  has  been  pointed  out  as  a  main
cause  of  earthquakes  and  in  (4)  the  Gutenberg-Richter  law  for  large  earthquakes  was
obtained on the basis of assuming a Brownian shape of the profiles and the hypothesis
that  energy  release  is  proportional  to  the  overlap  interval  between  profiles.  This  is  a
very appealing explanation, but in this as in many other models the material between the
fault planes is not considered. When it is, as in (5), it is considered more to deaden than
to  trigger  earthquakes.  Nevertheless,  the  irregularities  of  the  fault  planes  can  be
combined with the distribution of fragments between them to develop a mechanism of
triggering  earthquakes,  which  can  be  essentially  the  same  as  in  (4)  owing  to  the
irregular shape of the profiles and fragments.

Let  us  start  from  the  situation  illustrated  in  the  figure  1:  two  irregular  profiles  (no
predetermined shape is assumed) are able to slip as shown in the figure. The motion can
be hindered not only by the overlapping of two irregularities of the profiles, but also by
the  eventual  relative  position  of  several  fragments  as  illustrated  in  the  figure  between
the points “a” and “b”.

Tensions  in  the  resulting  structure  accumulated  until  a  displacement  of  one  of  the
asperities or even its breakage in the point of contact with the gouge fragment leads to a
relative  displacement  of  the  fault  planes  of  the  order  of  the  side  of  the  hindering
fragment  “r”.  Then,  the  eventual  release  of  tensions,  whatever  be  the  cause,  leads  to
such a displacement to the subsequent liberation of energy.

We assume this energy “e ” to be proportional to “r”, so that the size distribution of the
fragments in the gouge can reflect the energy distribution of earthquakes  generated by
this mechanism. It seems natural to accept the energy release by this mechanism should
be smaller than that related with the collision and breakup of  the  rough surface of  the
tectonic plate or  a large  fault, which is  a  tougher  mechanism, i.e. “small earthquakes”
should be well described by this model.

THE MODEL

As already pointed out, the size distribution function of fragments in the gouge should
reflect the energy distribution function of the “gouge earthquake”. We can assume that
the  constant  interaction  and  local  breakage  of  the  fault  planes  produce  the  fragments.
So, a fragmentation process produces them. The process of fault slip can be considered
to  occur  in  a  homogeneous  fashion  in  all  the  deep  of  the  fault  so  that  in  any  plane
transverse  to  the  deep  of  the  fault  the  situation  is  the  same.  Then,  to  deduce  the  size
distribution function of the fragments we consider a two-dimensional frame as the one
illustrated in figure 1. Then, our problem is to find the distribution of fragments by area.

The  maximum  entropy  principle  has  proved  to  be  useful  in  the  study  of  the
fragmentation  phenomena  (7), 
important  feature  of
in 
fragmentation i.e. the presence of scaling in the size distribution of fragments was not
obtained. We will also apply the maximum entropy principle but now with recourse to
the Tsallis entropy instead of the Boltzmann one. The Tsallis entropy for our problem
has the form:

that  work  an

where  p(s )  is  the  probability  of  finding  a  fragment  of  relative  surface  s
  referred  to
characteristic surface of the system, and q is a real number. k is Boltzmann’s constant. It
is easy to see that entropy reduces to the Boltzmann’s one when q ﬁ
 1. The sum by all
states  in  the  entropy  is  here  expressed  through  the  integration  in  all  sizes  of  the
fragments up to the largest surface S

 of the collection of fragments.

The  Tsallis  formulation  involves  the  introduction  of  at  least  two  constraints.  The  first
one is the normalization of p(s ):

and the other is the “ad hoc” condition about the q-mean value, which in our case can be
expressed as:

This  condition  reduces  to  the  definition  of  the  mean  value  when  q  ﬁ
  1.  More
information  concerning  the  constraints  that  can  be  imposed  in  the  formulation  can  be
seen in (9).

This formulation of the statistical physics, known as “non extensive” formulation, since
this  entropy  is  not  additive,  has  proved  to  be  very  useful  to  describe  phenomena  in
which Boltzmann statistics fails to give a correct explanation, specially when the spatial
correlations  cease  to  be  short  ranged  (10).  Fracture  is  a  paradigm  of  such  long-range
interaction  phenomenon,  and  we  gave  a  formulation  in  terms  of  Tsallis  statistics  very

sq  subject to the conditions

given by formulas 2 and 3. To simplify we will assume <<s >>q = 1. As will be seen this
has  no  effect  in  the  final  result.  Application  of  the  method  of  Lagrange  multipliers
gives:

If we now introduce the proportionality of the released relative energy e  with the linear
dimension r of the fragments, as s
 scales with r2, the resulting expression for the energy
distribution function of the earthquakes due to this mechanism is:

Hence,  we  have  obtained  an  analytic  expression  which  can  be  fitted  to  the  energy
distribution of  earthquakes  through  Z(q,S ),  b
 and  q.  This  was  obtained  from  a  simple
model  starting  from  first  principles.  No  ad  hoc  hypothesis  was  introduced  but  the
proportionality of “e ” and “r”, which seems justified.

DATA AND APPLICATION OF THE MODEL

The Andalusian Institute of Geophysics and Seismic Disaster Prevention compiled the
earthquake  catalogue  used  in  this  study.  The  earthquakes  were  observed  by  the
Andalusian  Seismic  Network  of  the  Andalusian  Institute  of  Geophysics  and  Seismic
Disaster  Prevention  that  consists  of  more  than  20  observational  stations  [12].  The
analyzed area is the rectangular region between 35º and 38º North Latitude and between
0º and 5º West Longitude, hereinafter called the South of the Iberian Peninsula region.
Figure 2 shows the epicenters of the earthquakes of the South of the Iberian Peninsula
region catalogue (more than 20000 events). Error of the hypocentres’ location in the x, y
and  z  directions  are  more  or  less  – 1  km,  – 1  km  and  – 2  km,  respectively  [13].  The
seismicity during the period from 1985 to 2000 may be considered normal, i.e., without
major seismic events. The Gutenberg-Richter relation is satisfied in this data set, at least
for  earthquakes  with  magnitude  greater  than  2.5.  The  data  is  assumed  to  be  free  of
observational bias and abnormal seismicity. The formula 6 was used to fit the result of
about 12000 earthquakes with magnitude less than 2.5.

In  the  figure  3,  it  is  shown  the  cumulative  number  of  earthquakes  of  magnitude  “m”
(earthquakes with a magnitude equal or larger than “m”, being “m” the logarithm of the
relative energy “e ”) in the region of small energy vs. “m”.

With a, b and c as parameters to fit the data. A good fitting can be seen with the integral
of formula 6, showing that the functional dependence here obtained is correct. This is a
very  interesting  fact  since  it  is  known  that  the  Gutenberg-Richter’s  fails  to  describe
small earthquakes [14] and large earthquakes [15]. The above-obtained expression gives
a good fitting precisely in the region of small energies. This is an argument in favor of
the proposed image from previous sections: small earthquakes seem thus to be closely
related with the interactions in the gouge.

CONCLUSIONS

A functional dependence was obtained for the distribution of earthquakes produced by
interactions  in  the  gouge,  starting  from  a  non-extensive  formulation  of  the  maximum
entropy principle (the Tsallis formulation). The active role of the material between the
tectonic plates was in evidence  with this  model that  seems  to relate  some  earthquakes
with  the  material  of  the  gouge.  Tsallis  formulation  is,  as  can  be  seen,  determinant  to
obtain  the  energy  distribution  of  small  earthquakes.  No  a  priori  assumption  about  the
fault profile or shape of the fragments was needed.

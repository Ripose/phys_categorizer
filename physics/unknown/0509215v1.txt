Abstract

We report measurements on ultrasonic systems analogous to random lasers.   One

system  entails  ultrasonic  feedback  between  distinct  transducers,  another  involves  a

spontaneously emitting piezoelectric device.   Both are found to exhibit rich behaviors

similar  to  those  of  lasers.   In  both  overlapped  and  non-overlapped  modal  regimes we

observe  extraordinarily  narrow  single  emission  lines,  sensitivity  to  linear  cavity

properties, complex multi-mode emissions, and line narrowing.   We imagine that these

devices and their generalizations may provide convenient testbeds for future research on

random lasers.

Rich  physics  and  practical  applications  have  stimulated  interest  in  random  and

ray-chaotic lasers[1-19].   Such lasers differ from conventional lasers in that feedback is

due  to  multiple  scattering,  or  reverberation  in  a  chaotic  cavity.    Here  we  report two

ultrasonic  systems  exhibiting  behavior  like  that  of  such  lasers.    Because  ultrasonic

systems permit probes and controls to a degree not possible in optics, these systems will,

we  believe,  be  valuable  tools  in  future laser  research.    One  of  our  uasers (ultrasonic

amplification by self-excited resonance) is constructed from a reverberant elastic body

attached to a piezoelectric sensor which feeds, after suitable amplification, a piezoelectric

actuator.    Another  is  formed  from  a  single  piezoelectric  transducer  in  an  operational

amplifier  auto-oscillator.  Both  are  found  to  exhibit  rich  behaviors  similar  to  those  of

lasers.  In both overlapped and non-overlapped modal regimes we observe extraordinarily

narrow single emission lines, sensitivity to linear cavity properties, complex multi-mode

emissions, and line narrowing[9].    We observe these behaviors in both ray-chaotic and

multiply scattering systems.

Theoretical  understanding  of  random  lasers  is  complicated  by  their  essential

nonlinearity  and  by  the  complex  interplay  of  several  times  scales.   These  include

Heisenberg times to resolve modes, Thouless times to diffuse, absorption times, escape

times,  Ehrenfest  times,  and  rates  of  gain.  Optical  experiments  are  complicated  by

challenges  in  precisely  controlling  microscopic  properties,  limited  information  on

processes far from the sample boundary, and inability to measure the phase of the electric

field  [9].   Numerical  experiments  for  realistic  3-d  systems  are  computationally

demanding.   For these reasons a full understanding of random lasers has been slow to

develop and venues for more precise experiments are to be desired.

Coherent laser oscillation is not necessarily a quantum phenomenon [20]. Indeed,

the  observation  by  Huyghens  in  1665  of  mode  locking  between  two  pendulum  clocks

may be the first report of laser-like action.    Quantum dots and optical resonators have

been  studied  using  microwaves  and  ultrasonics  [21,22].   Similarly  one  expects  that

classical wave experiments such as those presented here could complement research on

lasers. Consider the ultrasonic system pictured in figure 1.    A piezoelectric device with

useful sensitivity in the range from 100 to 2000 kHz and a diameter of 3 mm is placed at

an arbitrary position x on an irregular elastic body.    We typically use aluminum (shear

and  longitudinal wavespeeds  3.1  and  6.15  mm/µsec) of generic ray-chaotic shape and

volume between 50 and 5000 cm3.    Relevant wavelengths lie in the range between 30

and  1.5  mm.   The  signal  from  the  sensor  at  x  is  amplified  by  40  dB  [23],  passed

(optionally)  through  a  filter  to  control  the  frequency  range  available,  sampled  by  a

digitizer, passed through an adjustable voltage divider and amplified by a further 40 dB

before being passed to a piezoelectric actuator at y that provides the ultrasonic source.   A

third transducer monitors the acoustic state of the elastic block at z.  With sufficient gain

(small enough voltage division) the circuit auto-oscillates with a strength governed by

saturation of the amplifiers.

Figure 1 shows the behavior in the time domain after the circuit is turned on. The

transition to uasing shows strong threshold-like behavior like that of an optical laser.  For

this configuration at gains less than 50 dB there is no auto-oscillation.  At 50 dB (upper

curve),  we  observe  a  slow  transition,  over  about  one  second,  from  a  wide  band  low

amplitude noisy background to a saturated auto-oscillation at about 700 kHz.  At slightly

higher  gain  (lower  curve),  the  transition  is  quicker  and  the  final  state  has  higher

amplitude.

Figure 2a shows the spectrum of the ordinary acoustic response | H(ω) | of the

passive system consisting of transducers and block but no feedback.  H(ω) is the response

of  the  transducer  at  y  when  an  impulse  is  applied  to  the  transducer  at  x.  H(ω) is the

product of the  elastodynamic Green's function G(ω) of the sample[24] and the transducer

functions. The broad peaks around 700, 1000 and 1500 kHz are characteristic of these

transducers.   That the uasing seen above takes place near 700 kHz is thus not surprising;

this is in one of the main pass bands of the transducers.  Sample steady state-spectra are

shown  in  figures  2b.    We  observe  uaser  lines  within  the  broad  peaks  of  the  ordinary

passive spectrum.   In optics this would correspond to lasing near the maximum of the

gain  profile.   At  modest  gains  we  typically  observe  a  single  line,  but  on  occasion,

especially at larger gain, the uaser shows many lines.   The precise position of the line(s)

depends  on  actuator  and  sensor  position,  on  strength  of  gain,  on  temperature,  and

sometimes  hysteretically  on  the  history  of  these  parameters.   Line  widths  are

extraordinarily narrow, much narrower than would be expected based on the Q (30,000)

of  the  elastic  body  at  these  frequencies.     We  monitor  the  frequency  of  the  auto

oscillation with a five-digit counter (a 0.1 second integration time at these frequencies).

Line positions are observed to be narrow to within our resolution (10 Hz) and stable over

periods  of  minutes,  depending  only  on  temperature.   This  degree  of  stability  is

comparable to that obtained using similar circuits and quartz crystal oscillators.

Figure  2c  shows  a  fine  scale  overlay  of  the  uaser  spectrum  and  the  ordinary

passive spectrum |H(ω)|.  On this scale the ordinary spectrum has features related to the

reverberant cavity.  At these frequencies the modes of the sample are closely spaced, thus

the features in 2c are Ericson fluctuations[25].    It may be seen that the uaser oscillation

tends to occur at a local maximum of the ordinary spectrum, but not precisely.  Nor is the

uaser line necessarily near the strongest of the peaks.     A detailed analysis supports a

theoretical prediction that the onset of uasing occurs at the frequency at which the gain

g(ω)  is  such  that  the  product  of  g(ω)  and  H(ω)  (including  its  phase)  is  unity.  [See

supplemental material.]

Figure 2d shows the spectrum obtained at high gain in a large volume (3000cc)

high Q body.  The many lines (all narrow to within our resolution of 10 Hz) are ascribed

to nonlinear mixings between at least two primary uaser lines near 750 and 1500 kHz. At

these acoustic amplitudes nonlinearity is confined to the amplifiers and their saturation; it

is not in the wave propagation.

Uasing occurs also in disordered multiply scattering structures, direct analogs of

random lasers[9].    We have examined 2-d multiply scattering diffusing and localizing

systems  [22],  and  a  simple  two-room  system  [22]  that  localizes  at  low  frequency;

behaviors  are  similar.   Some  of  these  structures  have  higher  absorption  than  do  the

ballistic bodies and correspondingly require higher gain before they uase.

In a low Q system consisting of a Plexiglas block the lines remain more narrow

than we can resolve.  At these frequencies the Plexiglas is only moderately reverberant;

typical rays reflect only once or twice from the walls before being absorbed.  The system

therefore better resembles conventional acoustic feedback.    Lines in this Plexiglas body

are less stable against variations in gain than they are in aluminum.

A coherent optical laser consists of distinct oscillators that may lock by means of

their mutual connection to the radiation field they generate [26].   It differs from the

sensor-actuator pair of figure 1.  For this reason the acronym "uaser" above was based on

the words "self-excited resonance."   To better model stimulated emission of radiation, a

different design is called for.  Towards that end we built a model of a single atom laser

[27,28] consisting of an Wein bridge operational-amplifier oscillator circuit connected to

a single piezoelectric transducer.  See figure (3).   In the absence of the cavity, i.e, when

the transducer is unconnected to a solid body, the circuit oscillates, but does so in an

unsteady fashion, with frequency changing erratically.   When contact is made with a

high Q elastic body, the oscillator narrows and stabilizes.    Uasing is highly sensitive to

cavity properties.  The occurrence of a narrow line and the frequency of the line varies

with position on the body, with the choice of body and with the changes in the body (e.g.

adding absorption.)   Thus the oscillation is like that of a conventional single-atom laser,

with an oscillator that self-locks by means of its connection to the radiation field it

These points are supported by figure 3.   The spontaneous emission spectrum of

the isolated Wein bridge including transducer unattached to the elastic body has a finite

width of 30 to 1000 Hz.   When attached to the elastic body, the line shifts, and narrows

to a width finer than our resolution.

It may be noted that the above systems are simpler than the "sasers" proposed by

others  [28,29]  based  on  stimulated  emission  of  phonons  or  of  sound  from  oscillating

generates.

bubbles.

Optical  lasers  are  useful  in  practice  owing  to  their  propensity  for  coherent

emission, their high intensity, and their potential for rapid switching.  These features are

of little value in acoustics; coherence is the rule not the exception, intensity is limited by

power availability, and maximum speeds are limited by the moderate frequencies.  Thus

we are reluctant to claim acoustic applications for a uaser.  We do express an opinion that

such devices could model optical laser oscillators.  Because of the ease with which their

parameters can be controlled and their state monitored, such devices could be of value in

studies of laser dynamics.

Systems such as those of figures 1 and 3 may be modified in various ways chosen

to  explore  issues  in  optical  lasing.   An  obvious  modification  would  consist  of  two  or

more  independent  sensor-actuator  pairs  like  those  of  fig(1)  applied  to  the  same  body.

Another would apply multiple "atoms" like that of figure 3 to a single solid or fluid body

of  one,  two  or  three  dimensions,  with  any  of  a  variety  of  boundary  conditions.   Each

transducer  would  represent  one  continuously  pumped  atom.    Many  questions  occur,

arising from issues originating in optical systems.   What is the effect of noise on line

width?    What  conditions  lead  to  chaotic  uasing?   What  is  the  effect  of  time-varying

acoustic parameters?   What is the effect of nonlinearity in the acoustics?   What is the

effect of multiple scattering on the minimum gain needed for uasing?  What is the shape

of the uasing mode?   How does coupling between modes affect the uasing?   Is there a

mode-locking  phase  transition  [30]?    Detailed  studies  of  ultrasonic  systems  could

advance our knowledge of their optical counterparts.  We look forward to a period of rich

experimentation.

Figure 1]   In the simplest uaser, a piezoelectric sensor monitors elastic waves at x; these

signals are amplified, optionally filtered, optionally monitored by an oscilloscope,

voltage-divided, and amplified again before being fed to a piezoelectric actuator at y.  A

third transducer monitors system response at z.  At sufficient gain one observes an

unstable growth of a single frequency auto-oscillation.  At slightly higher gain (lower

curve) the growth is faster.

Figure 2]  Qualititative behaviors of the uaser.  Panel a shows the ordinary passive

spectrum of a typical system like that of figure 1, obtained by Fourier analysing the

transient response of the transducer at y to an impulsive forcing at x.    The broad peaks at

700, 1000 and 1500 kHz are characteristic of the transducers, as are the finer structures

with spacings of the order of 43 kHz (related to a 23 microsecond round trip travel time

up and down the transducer barrel.)  The finest structures (on a sub kHz scale and not

visible here) are due to the elastic block and correspond to a speckle-like diffuse

reverberant random response in this ray-chaotic body.   Panel b shows typical simple

uaser spectra consisting of one (dashed) or a few (solid) sharp lines.   Panel c shows a

fine resolution comparison of the ordinary spectrum and the corresponding uaser

spectrum.  It can be seen that the uaser line (apparent width 10 Hz is artificially dictated

by the amount of time captured) occurs near a local maximum of the ordinary spectrum.

Panel d shows the (square root of) the spectrum of a uaser auto oscillation for a case of

high gain, a case with a multitude of lines.  The inset shows the spectrum at finer

resolution.  These line spacings are dominated, but not exclusively, by a value of 3.7 kHz,

suggesting a near-periodicity of 270 microseconds.

Figure 3]   A single atom uaser is formed by inserting a piezoelectric

transducer in an operational amplifier circuit, a "Wein bridge" oscillator.

The electronic parameters R, C, and the capacitance of the transducer

specify the frequency range in which auto-oscillation can occur.  In the

absence of contact with a reverberant body, the circuit oscillates erratically,

spontaneously emitting acoustic radiation.   This is illustrated in the plots as

a wide noisy grey (red online) curve.   When in good contact with a finite

reverberant elastic body, the oscillator stabilizes, as indicated in the sharp

lines (blue online).  The three cases above differ by different position on the

block, or different choice of circuit parameter R.  Continuous curves indicate

the ordinary pulse-echo spectrum of the system when the transducer is

disconnected from the Wein bridge and connected to an ultrasonic pulser

and receiver.

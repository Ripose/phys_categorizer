Abstract 

 
In  this  paper  we  revise  the  similarity  theory  for  the  stably  stratified  atmospheric  boundary 
layer  (ABL),  formulate  analytical  approximations  for  the  wind  velocity  and  potential 
temperature  profiles  over  the  entire  ABL,  validate  them  against  large-eddy  simulation  and 
observational  data,  and  develop  an  improved  surface  flux  calculation  technique  for  use  in 
operational models.

1. Introduction 

 
Parameterisation of turbulence in atmospheric models comprise two basic problems:  

turbulence  closure  –  to  calculate  vertical  turbulent  fluxes,  first  of  all,  the  fluxes  of 
r
momentum and potential temperature: τr  and  θF  through the mean gradients: 
 
dzUd /

 (where z is the height,  U
and 
d /Θ
temperature); 
flux-profile relationships – to calculate the fluxes at the earth’s surface:

This  paper  focuses  on  the  flux-profile  relationships  for  stable  and  neutral  stratification.  At 
first  sight,  it  could  be  solved  numerically  using  an  adequate  turbulence-closure  model. 
However, this way is too computationally expensive: the mean gradients close to the surface 
are very sharp, which requires very high resolution, not to mention that the adequate closure 
for strongly stable stratification can hardly be considered as a fully understood, easy problem.

Hence the practically sound problem is to analytically express the surface fluxes 
through 
  available  in  numerical  models  (and  similarly  for  the 
fluxes  of  humidity  and  other  scalars).  In  numerical  weather  prediction  (NWP)  and  climate

In  neutral  or  near-neutral  stratification  the  solution  to  the  above  problem  is  given  by  the 
logarithmic wall law:

In  stable  stratification,  the  problem  becomes  more  complicated.  Its  commonly  accepted 
solution is based, firstly, on the assumption that the level  1z  belongs to the surface layer [that 
is  the  lower  one  tenth  of  the  ABL,  where  the  turbulent  fluxes  do  not  diverge  considerably 
from  their  surface  valuesτ  ≈

similarity theory for the surface-layer turbulence (Monin and Obukhov (1954).  
 
The  MO  theory  states  that  the  turbulent  regime  in  the  stratified  surface  layer  is  fully 
characterized  by  the  turbulent  fluxes,  τ  ≈  
∗F ,  and  the  buoyancy 
parameter,  β = 
0T  is a reference value of 
absolute temperature), which determine the familiar MO length scale

The above analysis is usually considered as relevant only to the surface layer. However, the 
basic statement of the MO similarity theory, namely, that the surface-layer turbulence is fully 
characterised by τ,  θF  and  β, is applicable to locally generated turbulence in more general 
context.  Nieuwstadt  (1984)  was  probably  the  first  who  extended  the  MO  theory  by 
substituting  the  height-dependent  τ  and 
∗F ,  and 
demonstrated  its  successful  application  to  the  entire  nocturnal  stable  ABL.  In  the  present 
paper we employ this extended version of the MO theory.

However,  as  recognised  recently,  the  concept  of  the  critical  Ri  contradicts  to  both 
experimental evidence and analysis of the turbulent kinetic and potential energy budgets. This 
conclusion  is  by  no  means  new.  Long  ago  it  has been  understood  that  turbulent  closures  or

surface  flux  schemes  implying  the  critical  Ri  lead  to  erroneous  conclusions,  such  as 
unrealistic decoupling of air flows from underlying surface in all cases when Ri >  Ric. It is 
not surprising that modellers do not use Eq. (4) as well as other formulations of similar type, 
even though they are supported by experimental data. Instead, operational modellers develop 
their own flux-profile relationships, free of Ri critical, and evaluate them indirectly – fitting 
the  model  results  to  the  available  observational  data.  Different  points  of  view  of 
experimentalists  and  operational  modellers  on  the  flux-profile  relationships  have  factually 
caused two nearly independent lines of inquiry in this field (see discussion in Zilitinkevich et 
al., 2002).  
 
One  more  point  deserves  emphasising.  Currently  used  flux-calculation  schemes  identify  the 
turbulent fluxes calculated at the level  1z  with the surface fluxes. However, in strongly stable 
stratification, especially in long-lived stable ABLs, the ABL height, h, quite often reduces to a 
few  dozen  metres1  (see  Zilitinkevich  and  Esau,  2002,  2003;  Zilitinkevich  et  al.,  2006a)  and

nothing in common with 
 
Furthermore,  the  MO  theory,  considered  over  half  a  century  as  an  ultimate  background  for 
analysing  the  surface  layer  turbulence,  is  now  revised.  Zilitinkevich  and  Esau  (2005)  have 
found  that,  besides  L,  Eq.  (2),  which  characterise  the  stabilising  effect  of  local  buoyancy 
fL  characterising the effect of the 
forces on turbulence, there are two additional length scales: 
NL   characterizing  the  non-local  effect  of  the  static  stability  in  the  free

where N is the Brunt-Väisälä frequency at z > h (typically N ~10-2 s-1), and f is the Coriolis

stronger mechanisms that is to smaller scales) a composite turbulent length scale becomes:

Practical  application  of  this  scaling  requires  information  about  vertical  profiles  of  turbulent 
fluxes  across  the  ABL.  As  demonstrated  by Lenshow  et  al.  (1988),  Sorbjan  (1988),  Wittich 
  and 
(1991),  Zilitinkevich  and  Esau  (2005)  and  Esau  and  Byrkjedal  (2006),  the  ratios 
∗FF /θ
 are reasonable accurately approximated by universal functions of z/h, where h is the 
ABL height [see Eq. (15) below].  
 
As follows from the above discussion, currently used surface flux calculation schemes need to 
be improved accounting for  

∗ττ/

•  modern  experimental  evidence  and  theoretical  developments  arguing  against  the 

•  additional  mechanisms  and  scales,  first  of  all 

NL ,  disregarded  in  the  classical 

critical Ri concept, 

similarity theory for stable ABLs,  

•  essential difference between the surface fluxes and the fluxes at z  =  1z .  

 
In  the  present  paper  we  attempt  to  develop  a  new  scheme  applicable  to  as  wide  as  possible 
range of stable and neutral ABL regimes using recent theoretical developments and new, high 
quality data from observations and LES.  
 
 

2. Mean gradients and Richardson numbers 
 
Until  recently  the  ABLs  were  distinguished  accounting  for  only  one  factor,  the  potential 
temperature  flux  at  the  surface, 
∗F   <  0. 
Accounting for the recently disclosed role of the static stability above the ABL, we now apply 
more detailed classification:  

∗F   =  0,  and  stable  ABLs  at 

∗F :  neutral  ABLs  at 

∗F  =  0, N  =  0, 

truly neutral (TN) ABL: 

• 
•  conventionally neutral (CN) ABL:
•  nocturnal stable (NS) ABL: 
• 
long-lived stable (LS) ABL: 

∗F  < 0, N  = 0, 
∗F  < 0, N  > 0. 

∗F  = 0, N  >  0,  

Realistic surface flux calculation scheme should be based on a model applicable to all these 
types of the ABL.  
 
As mentioned in Section 1, Eq. (4b) gives erroneous asymptotic behaviour at large  ξ = z/L 
and leads to appearance of the critical Ri. This conclusion is sometimes treaded as a failure of 
the  MO  theory,  but  this  is  not  the  case.  The  MO  theory  states  only  that 
HΦ   are 
universal  functions  of  ξ,  whereas  the  linear  forms  of  the  Φ -functions,  Eq.  (4),  are  derived 
form  the  heuristic  concept  of  z-less  stratification,  which  is  neither  proved  theoretically  nor 
confirmed by experimental data.  
 
In  fact,  this  concept  is  not  needed  to  derive  the  linear  asymptotic  formula  for  the  velocity 
gradient in the stationary, homogeneous, sheared flows in very strong static stability. Recall 
that the flux Richardson number is defined as the ratio of the consumption of turbulent kinetic 
θβF , to the shear generation of the 
energy (TKE) caused by the negative buoyancy forces, –

Therefore to assure unlimited growth of Ri with increasing  ξ (in other words, to guarantee 
“no  Ri  critical”),  the  asymptotic  ξ-dependence  of 
HΦ   should  be  stronger  then  linear. 
HΦ   at  small  ξ  is  known  to  be  close  to  linear,  a  reasonable

On these grounds we adopt the approximations

MΦ  and 
and the steep thin line shows the asymptotic behaviour of our approximation, Ri  ~ ξ, at large 
ξ. Heavy points with error bars are the bin averaged values after LES DATABASE64.  
 
This  figure  demonstrates  consistency  between  the  LES  and  the  field  data  for  so  sensitive 
parameter as Ri (the ratio of gradients – inevitably determined with pronounced errors). For 
our  analysis  this  result  is  critically  important.  It  allows  using  the  LES  DATABASE64  on 
equal grounds with experimental data. Recall that using LES we have the advantage of fully 
controlled conditions, which is practically unachievable in field experiments.  
 
We  give  here  one  example:  Dealing  with  LES  data  we  receive  a  possibility  to  distinguish 
between data for the ABL interior, z < h (indicated in our figures by  dark  grey  points)  and 
data for z > h (indicated by light grey points). As seen in Figure 3, the gradient Richardson 
number  within  the  ABLs  practically  never  exceeds  0.25  –  0.3,  although  turbulence  is 
observed  at  much  larger  Ri.  This  observation  perfectly  correlates  with  recent  theoretical 
conclusion that Ri ~ 0.25 is not the critical Ri in old sense (the border between turbulent and 
laminar regimes) but a threshold separating the two turbulent regimes of essentially different 
nature: strong, chaotic turbulence at Ri << 0.25; and weak, intermittent turbulence at Ri >> 
0.25. These two are just the regimes typical of the ABLs and the fee atmosphere, respectively.  
 
 

3. Surface fluxes  

  
The above analysis clarifies our understanding of the physical nature of stable ABLs but does 
not immediately give flux-profile relationships suitable for practical applications. To receive 
analytical approximations of the mean wind and temperature profiles, U(z) and  Θ (z), across 
the ABL, we apply the generalised similarity theory presented in Section 2 to “characteristic 
functions”:

allow determining the turbulent fluxes, τand  θF , and the MO length, 
, at the 
computational  level  z.  Numerical  solution  to  this  system  is  simplified  by  the  fact  that  the 
major terms on the right hand sides are the logarithmic ones, and moreover, the second terms 
in square brackets are usually small compared to unity. Hence iteration methods should work 
efficiently. As a first approximation N, unknown until we determine the ABL height, is taken 
N = 0. In the next iterations, it is calculated after Eq. (18).

(Zilitinkevich et al., 2006a, and references therein) consistent with the present analyses. The

based on the same similarity theory as the preset paper [see Eqs. (7b), (41b), (43) and Figure 4  
in Zilitinkevich and Esau (2005)]. 
 
Following the above procedure, Eqs. (14)-(18) allow calculating the following parametres: 
turbulent fluxes τ(z) and  θF (z) at any computational level z within the ABL,  

• 
•  surface fluxes,  ∗τr  and 
•  ABL height, h, [either diagnostically after Eq. (16) or more accurately, accounting for 

∗F ,  

it evolution after Eqs. (16)-(17)].  

Empirical constants that appear in the above formulations are given in Table 1.  
 
The  proposed  method  can  be  applied,  in  particular,  to  shallow  ABLs,  when  the  lowest 
computational  level  is  close  to  h,  and  standard  approach  completely  fails.  But  it  has 
advantages  also  in  usual  situations  when  the  ABL  (the  height  interval  0  <  z  <  h)  contains

4. Concluding remarks  

MΦ  and 

HΦ , Eq. (3), based on the composite turbulent length scale 

  
In this paper we employ a generalised similarity theory for the stably stratified sheared flows 
accounting  for  non-local  features  of  atmospheric  stable  ABLs,  follow  modern  views  on  the 
turbulent  energy  transformations  rejecting  the  critical  Richardson  number  concept,  and  use 
recent,  high  quality  experimental  and  LES  data  to  develop  analytical  formulations  for  the 
wind velocity and potential temperature profiles across the entire ABL. 
 
Results  from  our  analysis  are  validated  using  LES  data  from  DATABASE64  covering  the 
four  types  of  ABLs:  truly  neutral,  conventionally  neutral,  nocturnal  stable  and  long-lived 
stable. These LES are in turn validated through (shown to be consistent with) observational 
data from the field campaign SHEBA.  
 
Employing  generalised  format  for  the  dimensionless  velocity  and  potential  temperature 
gradients, 
∗L , Eq. (7), 
, we demonstrate 
and z-dependent turbulent velocity and temperature scales, 
∗L  
that  
MΦ  linear, 
(
 
Using the quadratic polynomial approximation for 
HΦ , we demonstrate that our formulation 
leads  to  the  unlimitedly  increasing  z/L-dependence  of  the  gradient  Richardson  number,  Ri, 
consistent with both LES and field data and arguing against the critical Ri concept. 
 
We  employ  the  above  generalised  format  to  the  deviations, 
ΘΨ ,  Eq.  (12),  of  the 
dimensionless mean wind and potential temperature profiles from their logarithmic parts [ ~ 
ln(
  that 
perform quite well across the entire ABL. 
 
On this basis, employing also our prior ABL height model and resistance laws, we propose a 
new method for calculating the turbulent fluxes at the surface in numerical models.  
 
 

HΦ  are to a reasonable accuracy approximated by universal functions of z/

HΦ  stronger then linear) across the entire ABL.

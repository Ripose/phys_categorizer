The radio-frequency power radiated from laser-target plasmas in a vacuum can be orders of mag-
nitude greater than expected from such sources that have a negligible electric dipole moment.  A 
model  combining  the  Tidman-Stamper  circuit  model  of  a  laser-target  plasma  with  the  theory  of 
radiation from  currents immersed in plasmas, however, predicts  scaling of electric-dipole power 
radiated from laser plasmas in agreement with experiments. 

This  paper  presents  a  simple  model  of  electron  currents 
immersed  in  laser  plasmas  that  estimates  the  power,  angular 
distribution,  and  spectrum  of  radio-frequency  (rf)  radiation 
from  laser  plasmas  produced  on  solid  surfaces  in  vacuum.  
The  estimates  of  rf  power  are  compared  with  experimental 
data  from  CO2-laser  interactions  with  copper  targets  at  inci-
dent intensities from about 60 MW/cm2 to 40 GW/cm2. 
  The  model  agrees  with  the  limited  observations  of  rf-
power  scaling  with  laser  power,  with  the  radial  and  angular 
dependence  of  the  near-zone  fields,  and  with  the  correspon-
dence  of  rf  radiation  with  the  formation  of  a  critical-density 
surface.    The  model  should  be  valid  over  a  range  of  laser 
wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the long-wavelength infra-
red.  The model assumes quasi-steady-state, one-dimensional 
ablation, which is valid as long as the laser pulses are not too 
short and the laser spots are not too small to establish nearly 
steady ablation across a nearly planar critical-density surface.  
The model should also be valid over a range of incident laser 
intensities that produce plasma electron temperatures of a few 
eV,  just  above  the  plasma  ignition  threshold,  to  1  keV  or 
higher.  At higher laser intensities, double layers and hot elec-
trons may affect rf production through their dipole moments.   
  Although  laser  plasmas  have  a  negligible  electric  dipole 
moment  at  these  low  intensities,  the  theory  of  currents  im-
mersed in plasmas suggests that the rf radiation from the cur-
rent  in  the  diffuse  plasma  surrounding  the  dense  plasma 
plume is not cancelled by radiation from the equal and oppo-
site  current  in  the plume.    If  the  rf  radiation  from  such  laser 
plasmas can be understood from a model such as this, then the 
radiation  might  serve  as  a  diagnostic  tool  for  laser  plasmas.  
For example, the rf radiation can be used as a sensitive indica-
tor for the threshold of formation of critical-density surfaces. 
  The first observations of voltages on isolated laser targets 
[1] and of rf emissions from laser plasmas [2] were tentatively 
attributed to charge-separation (capacitive) electric fields.  At 
about the same time, nonthermal microwaves observed from a 
plasma focus were attributed to the Buneman instability in the 
pinched  plasma  [3].    Microwave  emissions  from  a  plasma 
point and a plasma focus were investigated to study localized 
high-temperature  plasma  formations  in  high-current  pinched 
discharges  [4,5].    Observations  of  rf  emissions  during  the 
sublimation  of  metal  targets  by  a  1  ms,  low-intensity  laser 
were attributed to the dipole moment of a double layer at the 
front  of  the  turbulent  expanding  metal  vapor  [6].    At  much 
1510   W/cm2,  the  first 
higher  laser  intensities  of 
4 10
direct  indications  of  double  layers  in  laser  plasmas  were  in-
ferred  from  measurements  of  plasma  potentials  and  charged 
particle currents [7].

  Measurements of rf radiation and electron emission current 
densities from aluminum laser targets were made in the range 
of laser intensities of interest for our model with 1011 W/cm2, 
10 ps  pulses  to  scale  the  rf  power  with  the  peak  intensity  of 
each  of  the  pulses  in  a  mode-locked-laser  pulse  train  [8].  
Radio-frequency  electric  currents  were  produced  on  metal 
targets  in  air  at  the  600-MHz  modulation  frequency  of  a  bi-
harmonic laser at 109 to 1010 W/cm2 [9].  Analysis of radiation 
at harmonics of electron waves in plasmas suggests that mo-
mentum  exchange  between  electrons  and  ions  can  produce 
dipole power that is comparable to, or somewhat greater than, 
the  quadrupole  power,  but not  by  many  orders  of  magnitude 
[10]. 
  The model of this letter is based on a simple circuit model 
of  a  laser  plasma  [11,12].    This  Tidman-Stamper  circuit 
model  estimates  the  voltage  drop  V  along  the  length  of  a 
dense  laser-plasma  plume  to  be  equal  to  T/e,  where  T  is  the 
plasma electron temperature in energy units, and e is the elec-
tron charge.  This letter combines the Tidman-Stamper model 
with the theory of an antenna current immersed in a plasma to 
predict rf radiation from single laser pulses incident on solid 
targets.    The  combined  model  treats  the  overdense  laser 
plasma as a short monopole antenna on a ground plane. 
  As in Ref. 11, the plasma plume is treated as a short cylin-
der  of  radius  a  and  length  d  with  a  voltage  drop 
 
V T e

between  the  target  surface  at  z  =  0  and  the  critical-density 
surface at  z = d, as  shown in Fig. 1.   And as in Ref. 11, the 
current  density 
a   is  assumed  to  be  radially  uniform 
within the cylinder.  The circuit equation of Ref. 11 then leads 
to a total current

the laser pulse duration . 
  The combined model determines the plasma electron tem-
perature  by  a  crude  partitioning  of  the  incident  laser  power

laser power that contributes to heating electrons is assumed to 
be a constant about equal to 0.2.  The rest of the laser power is 
partitioned,  without  consequence  to  the  model,  among  laser 
reflection,  hydrodynamic  expansion,  dissociation,  ionization, 
radiation, etc.

FIG. 1.  Illustration of model geometry showing dense plasma plume 
rising  from  target  surface  and  poloidal  currents  immersed  in  plasma

  Electron thermal energy is transported from the overdense 
region  through  the  critical  surface,  at  which  the  plasma  fre-
quency equals the laser frequency, by plasma at mass density 
c   and  at  speed 
cv .    For  quasi-steady-state  ablation,  this 
outward  flux  of  electron  thermal  energy  is  balanced  by  the 
fraction f of incident laser energy flux that flows inward from 
the  critical  surface,  where  the  laser  energy  is  absorbed,  and 
heats electrons.  Since the critical surface is a sonic point, the 
electron temperature at the critical surface is [13] 
 
 
 
where 
  As  shown  in  Fig.  1,  this  azimuthally  symmetric  current 
flows down the dense plasma plume and returns through the 
diffuse  plasma  surrounding  the  dense  plume  [12,14].    The 
current  distribution  resembles  a  poloidal  current  on  a  “fat” 
torus (for which the minor radius is about equal to the major 
radius).    Ordinarily,  this  current  distribution  would  radiate 
power of the same order as a magnetic dipole or electric quad-
rupole  [15].    Then  the  rf  power  would  be  expected  to  be 
smaller than the power from an electric dipole by a factor of 
order  (ka)2  <<  1,  where  k  is  the  rf  wavenumber.    But  the 
measured  rf  power  is  orders  of  magnitude  greater  than  that 
from  a  magnetic  dipole  or  electric  quadrupole.    Electric-
dipole power seeming to be radiated from a laser plasma that 
has  negligible  dipole  moment  may  be  explained  by  the  fol-
lowing mechanism. 
  A  system  of  n-poles  having  zero total  n-pole  moment  will 
generally produce n-pole radiation if the fields of the individ-
ual n-poles are modified differently in the source region.

large,  from  which  one  concludes  that  nearly  all  power  goes 
into the electroacoustic wave under such conditions [16,18]. 
  The theory suggests, therefore, that electromagnetic radia-
tion does not escape from a short thin antenna immersed in an 
overdense plasma [16].  (Here, “overdense” means the plasma 
p  is greater than the rf angular frequency  , not 
frequency 
the  laser  frequency.)    But  the  return  current,  which  flows  in 
the diffuse plasma surrounding the plume, does radiate with a 
dipole moment rate Id.  The net effect is that the laser plasma 
radiates as an electric dipole, instead of a quadrupole.  Radio-
frequency  radiation  can  still  escape  from  the  diffuse  plasma 
carrying the return current even if this diffuse plasma is over-
dense with respect to the rf frequency, as long as the charac-
teristic  dimensions  of  the  diffuse  plasma  are  less  than  the 
plasma skin depth.

A  laser  plasma  produced  on  a  timescale     should  radiate 
broadband  rf  at  frequencies  around  1/ 4   as  a  short,  thin 
monopole antenna on a ground reflecting plane.  The rf power 
radiated  above  the  target,  with  the  angular  distribution  of  an 
electric dipole, is

  Using  Eqs.  (1)  through  (4),  and  noting  that  the  critical 
c   scales  with  laser  wavelength    as 
plasma  mass  density 
3 / 2T
  and Spitzer conductivity scales as 
, we find the scal-
ing of rf power shown in Fig. 2.  Figure 2 compares the abso-
lute  model  predictions  of  rf  power  with  CO2-laser  experi-
ments [19].  The experiments used 3-ns to 4-ns-wide pulselets 
from  a  mode-locked  CO2  transversely-excited-atmospheric-
pressure laser focused through various optical attenuators to a 
200-m-diameter spot on solid copper targets immersed in a 
vacuum of about 
  The  model  predicts  that  the  frequency  of  fundamental-
mode rf  emissions  for these  experiments should have a peak 

410  Torr [19]. 

in the low VHF about 1/ 4  60 – 80 MHz.  But the antennas 
measured only frequencies    250 MHz in the high VHF and 
above  [19].    If  the  antennas  were  measuring  fundamental-
mode rf power below the roll-off in their frequency response 
or were measuring third or higher harmonics, then the data in 
[19] should underestimate the actual rf power. 
  Although  error  bars  are  not  available,  the  experiments  of 
Ref.  19  seem  to  support  the  model  scaling  of  rf  power  with 
peak  incident  laser  power,  and  seem  to  show  the  change  in 
scaling from resistive-voltage to inductive-voltage laser plas-
mas, as seen by the dashed lines in Fig. 2.  The experiments 
also  confirmed  that  rf  emissions  were  observed  only  when  a 
critical density surface was formed [19].   
 
If  this  model  correctly  explains  dipole  radiation  from  a 
source  having  a  negligible  dipole  moment,  then  the  door  is 
open for applications beyond mere diagnostic tools.  For ex-
ample,  one  might  imagine  compensating  for  atmospheric 
turbulence or steering a beam by nonlinear optical control of 
the phase of a beam over an optical surface through individual 
surface elements that have no moving parts.

Macroquantum Effects in Astronomy

Prof. Alexander M. Ilyanok

A  great  number  of  macroquantum 

laws  connecting  gravity  and
electromagnetism  if  found  empirically.  To  describe  them  the  model  of  anisotropic
gravitational field is proposed. This field is build as a superposition of planes and
force lines are changed by thin elastic discs. Interaction of gravitational objects is
described by second order linear differential equation having in some limits Newton
or  Maxwell  equations.  Tending  to  similar  description  of  electromagnetic  and
gravitational  forces  the  Newton  gravity  law  is  complemented  by  dynamical  part
dependent on speed of relative movement of objects. Static part of the Newton law is
provided by longitudinal waves. They penetrate along planes with the speed equal to
-a
 where  c  is the speed of light and a  is the fine structure constant.

Quantum  relativistic  picture  formed  in  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century  had
just  met  with  a  number  of  paradoxes.  Thus,  L.  de  Broglie  [1]  considered  particles  as
wave packs moving with the group speed vg and wavelength

where h  is the Planck constant. He had supposed that there is some speed  vf  of  wave
connected to the group speed by the relation

  from  it.  To  avoid  contradictions  with  special  relativity 

Equation  (1)  was  considerably  good  fitted  to  some  experiments.  Because  of
that it had become as basic in quantum mechanics. From the other hand, equation (2)
lead to the serious contradiction with special relativity because there always followed

considered  as  phase  speed  which  is  not  related  to  real  interactions  and    can  not  be
observed. Usually equation (2) was not taken into account as having no physical sense.
But  serious  contradictions  in  equation  (1)  also  were  hidden.  Thus,  if  vgﬁ

~ c  the  mass  of  a  particle  tends  to  the  mass  of  the  Earth,  for  example,  and  l

wavelength of the Earth is infinitely small. It is clear that the contradictions considered
are out of sense. And it is necessary to eliminate them.

The  second  problem  is  connected  with  the  theory  of  relativity.  Developing
theory of  H. Lorentz and A.  Poincare  Einstein  had  stated  that  there  was  no  ether  in
space and the light moved in vacuum with absolute speed  c independent on the speed
of  source  [1].  At  the  next  step  Einstein  had  postulated  that  all  physical  laws  are
invariant  under  Lorentz  transformations.  Applying  to  the  all-physical  scene  one  may
conclude  that  experimental  facts  obtained  for  relativistic  properties  of  elementary
particles may be expanded on condensed matter. But the serious barrier had appeared
before  Einstein  –  instantaneous  interaction  in  the  Newton’s  gravity  law.  In  other
words,  there  is  no  retarded  factor  in  the  Newton’s  law.  Let  us  remind  that  to  fit  the
Newton’s law to the energy conservation law the retarded part is needed.  Laplace  was

the  first  who  had  introduced  this  part  and  he  had  obtained  that  the  speed  of  gravity
interactions should be not less than 

. It is in contradiction with special relativity.

Einstein, Abraham, Nordstrom and some of other researchers had tried to solve
this contradiction by Lorentz invariant wave equations [2].  But  they  had  failed  to  do
that.  So  Einstein  had  refused  to  consider  gravity  as  a  field  and  had  introduced  a  new
type of ether  -
  curved  space-time.  He  had  created  general  relativity  theory.  But  in
nonlinear  space-time  there  are  problems  with  conservation  laws  including  gravity.
Despite  of  contradictions  of  general  relativity  it  has  stimulated  the  development  of
new  direction

the  Riemann  geometry 

in 

But  all  attempts  to  apply  the  models  of  geometrophysics  to  the  real  physical
objects  including  to  elementary  particles  had  appeared  completely  non-constructive.
Practically,  general  relativity  could  describe  only  two  experimental  facts  that  the
Newton’s  theory  did  not  describe.  They  are  the  anomaly  shift  of  the  Mercury
perihelion and deviation of star rays by the Sun.

Thus,  the  internally  contradictory  quantum  relativistic  picture  of  world  was

created.

So  let  us  return  to  the  linear  Newton’s  world.  But  let  us  mare  the  following
suppositions.  Gravity  is  described  by  the  field.  The  speed  of  penetration  of  the
interaction is finite but not restricted by the speed of light.

dependent  on  its  phase  state.  When  n=0  one  obtains 
the  ordinary  Lorentz
transformation.  Let  us  note  that  in  special  and  general  relativity  the  formal  transfer  of
laws  found  for  elementary  particles  without  spin  is  made  for  any  phase  state  of
substance.  It  is  the  sufficient  methodical  mistake  because  the  spin  of  particles  of
substance is not taken into account. But the spin is sufficient in chemical bonds. As a
consequence  of  that,  a  condensed  matter  can  not  move  in  vacuum  with  the  speed
exceeding 

 because it is simply evaporated.

Now  let  us  consider  a  system  of  gravitationally  connected  objects  like  Sun
system  or  the  Galaxy  as  some  type  of  macroscopic  condensate.  This  condensate  can
not  move  in  vacuum  with  the  speed  exceeding 
ca .  This  fact  is  confirmed  by  a
tremendous  number  of  observations,  for  example,  concerning  the  movement  of
galaxies relative to relict background radiation.

Let  us  assume  that  there  is  special  speed  of  gravitational  interaction  between
objects depending on limit speed of their relative motion  (n = 1, 2, 3, 4)  and  the  limit
radius of interaction corresponds to each of them. When  n = –1, –2, –3, –4  the  speed
of  interaction  is  higher  than  speed  of  light.  Let  us  show  what  is  the  matter  of  this
unusual  fact.  If  two  bodies  interact  by  the  field  between  each  other,  so  this  field  is  a
material  object  and,  hence,  it  should  possess  some  elasticity.  In  this  framework  one
should differ the elastic model of the vacuum and the model of the field itself. In this
case general wave equations in elastic medium may be used [3]:

medium,  ct  is the speed of transversal wave and  cl  is  the  speed  of  longitudinal  wave.
Newton’s  equations,  Maxwell’s  equations  and  hydrodynamic  equations  are  derived
from this equation as partial cases.

In  one’s  time  Maxwell  solving  equation  (3)  could  not  determine  the  nature  of
longitudinal wave. He had obtained that the speed of electromagnetic wave was equal
to  the  speed  of  light  and,  hence,  the  longitudinal  speed  exceeded  the  speed  of  light.
Maxwell  had  commented  this  phenomenon  very  prudently.  He  wrote  [4]  that
electromagnetism and optics are powerless when they are asked to confirm or to deny
that  longitudinal  vibrations  exist.  To  save  longitudinal  waves  there  should  be    an
“electrical  liquid”  of  definite  density  which  parameters  can  not  be  obtained  from  the
experiment.  But  subsequent  researchers  was  constantly  excluding  the  longitudinal
wave from the consideration as a wave of no physical sense.

At  the  modern  level  of  the  development  of  physics  the  physical  sense  of
Maxwell’s  longitudinal  wave  may  be  found.  This  is  the  type  of  waves  that  describes
Coulomb  and  Newton  forces.  It  is  well  known  that  elastic  forces  arisen  in  a  round
elastic disc depend on distance  R like  1/R2  and  for  bending  of  the  plate  they  behave
like  1/R3  in  linear  approximation  [3].  Such  forces  describe  the  laws  of  interaction
between charges and magnetic dipoles. That is, that the laws of Coulomb Ampere and
Newton  follow  naturally  from  the  model.  They  are  the  round  layers  that  longitudinal
waves penetrate down when s

» 0.5.

It  was  shown  experimentally  even  in  19th  century.  At  that  time  to  interpret
gravity  Buerknes  had  shown  that  bodies  floated  on  the  surface  of  a  liquid  attracted
when they pulsed in the same phase and rejected when they pulsed in opposite phases
according the law  1/R2 [5].  Buerknes  experiments  demonstrate  that  only  waves  along
the liquid surface realise exchange interaction.

So  let  us  to  consider  that  gravitational  field  of  separate  atoms  on  the  space  is
not continuous but is discrete. It is consisted of 861 discrete layers  -
  discs  connected
like  an  unfolded  book.  Our  world  felt  as  three-dimensional  is  formed  by  the
superposition of two-dimensional spaces. In this world the penetration of waves along
the layers is realised with the speed exceeded the speed of light when the movement of
waves and elementary particles between layers can have the speed, in principle, lower
than the speed of light.

In  times  of  Newton  and  Coulomb  elementary  particles  were  unknown  and
nothing  was  known  about  connection  between  their  masses  and  charges.  For  current
image  of  world  it  necessary  to  introduce  charges  into  the  Newton  gravity  law  and
masses into the Coulomb law. In this case let us suppose that gravitational field as not

3

-
totally  compensated  field  of  central  symmetric  dipole  composed  from  positive  and
negative charges. Mossotti (1836) was the first who had proposed that[2].

To describe gravitational interactions like electromagnetic fields it is necessary
to introduce equivalents of the scalar electrical and vector magnetic fields. At the first
time  it  was  noted  by  Heavisude.  He  had  proved  that  gravitational  field  can  be
expressed,  in  principle,  through  electromagnetic  one  if  one  represents  it  as  two
connected fields [6].

This statement follows directly from the  Helmholtz theorem: “Any vector field
 +

U if it is finite, one-valued and continuous can be represented by the sum U=  grad f
rot A» [3].

Let  us  state  that  for  the  force  of  interaction  between  objects  following
 „ 0 and rot  A „ 0. At the same  time  ct  „ 0,  cl  „ 0  in  (3).
condition  should  yield:  grad f
These conditions provide us an opportunity to conclude that any motion of the object
of  matter  in  its  own  field  or  in  the  field  of  the  object  interacting  with  it  will  be
rectilinear-rotated. It is natural because we on the Earth move along a spiral round the
Earth  orbit,  the  Earth  move  spirally  round  the  orbit  of  the  Sun  etc.  Essentially,
rectilinear motion can be attribute only to photons and neutrino. In this case  c,  in  fact,
is the critical speed of rectilinear motion. Let us note that elementary particles having
the rest mass should spin around their axis. Taking into account all aforementioned let
us represent the force of interaction between objects in general form:

where  the  first  term  describes  the  static  Coulomb  part  of  force  and  the  second  term
describes  the  dynamical  magnetic  component,  connected  with  the  movement  of
charges.  Therefore,  gravitational  field  should  have  the  component  connected  with  the
mass movement.

So  one  should  not  consider  a  static  gravitational  field  without  taking  into
account  the  relative  movement  of  masses.  Usually,  the  movement  of  the  satellite  on
the  orbit  is  connected  with  the  kinetic  energy  of  its  motion  or  centrifugal  forces.  But
the centrifugal force can be interpreted as some “dynamical antigravity”.

There is the serious problem in astronomy. It is in that the galaxies are rotating
as  linked  co-rotating  objects.  But  Newton  and  Einstein  equations  are  not  describing
these  movements.  Because  the  second  term  in  (5)  is  like  ‘magnetic’  force  it  is
proportional  to  the  velocity  of  the  object.  This  ‘dynamical’  part  of  the  world  gravity
will appear, for instance, when one try to take into account the influence of the rotation
of gravitational field with the Sun. The movement of the Solar ‘wind’ or movement of
stars  around  the  center  of  the  Galaxy  can  be  as  demonstrations  of  the  velocity
dependent terms in gravitational force.

For  example,  for  the  Mercury  the  gravitational  strength  on  its  orbit  with  the

radius R1 will depend on equatorial speed of the Sun rotation

Let  us  remind  that  stable  movement  of  the  planet  perihelion  the  Newton  had
investigated.  He  had  proved  that  the  expression  (5)  is  the  sole  case  describing  the
stable motion with rotation of perihelion.

The  other  example  of  the  action  of  the  dynamical  part  in  the  modified
Newton’s  law  (6)  is  the  deflection  of  light  in  the  Solar  gravitational  field.  Newton
considered  the  light,  as  any  other  material  body  will  take  place  in  gravitational
interactions.  After  100  years  Soldner  (1802)  had  calculated  this  interaction.  He  had
found  that  a  star  ray  moving  near  the  Sun  should  be  deflected  on  the  angle
  [7].  After  next  100  years  it  was  found  experimentally  that

the ray is really deflected by the Sun but the angle of deflection is in two times larger.
It was theoretically described due to Einstein general relativity [2].

Let  us  show  that  our  model  gives  the  same  results.  Taking  into  account  the
 -
dynamical part in (6) let us assume 
 this is the speed of light moving near the
Sun surface. As result the deflection of the ray is almost in two times more than in the
result  of  Soldner.  And  it  coincides  with  the  results  of  general  relativity  and  the
experiment.

So  to  describe  effects  of  anomaly  motion  of  the  Mercury  perihelion  and
deflection of photons in the gravitational field of the Sun it is not necessary to appeal
to the general relativity.

Let  us  return  again  to  the  problems  of  de  Broglie.  Let  us  introduce  a
generalized quantum of action in equation (1)

0m  is the magnet constant from SI .
where m is the rest mass of the proton or electron, 
Planck  constant  is,  in  general,  not  fundamental  one  but  it  is  the  combination  of
electromagnetic  and  world  constants.  With  the  help  of  equation  (8)  it  is  possible  to
connect the  microworld and  macroworld.  It  should  not  put  the  mass  of  condensed
matter  in  the  generalized  de  Broglie  equation.  The  mass  of  elementary  particles  play
the role here. So the de Broglie wavelength should be interpreted as the radius of the
spiral  of  the  object  movement.  It  is  related  as  to  macro,  as  well  as  to  microobjects
because the structure of the proton and electron and their superposition are defined the
type of their movement in  macrospace.

Taking  into  account  aforementioned  notes  let  us  suppose  the  Coulomb  and
gravitational  interaction  as  the  waves  of  a  field  connected  with  the  mass  and  the
charge.  At  that,  the  differential  equation  (3)  has  solutions  describing  stable  motion
1-a =137,0360547255. This  is  the  constant  of
only for layers connected with the step 
fine  structure  and  it  has  found  from  purely  geometrical  properties  by  the  formula,
shown  in  the  Table  1,  i.  1.  Solutions  of  the  equation  (3)  with  definite  boundary
conditions  for  different  cosmic  bodies  are  represented  in  Table  1.  The  comparison  of

theoretical and experimental results one may conclude that the generalized de Broglie
equation directly connects micro and macroworld.

Let  us  consider  the  second  de  Broglie  equation  (2).  Let  us  put  the  transversal
wave  into  correspondence  to  the  group  velocity  and  let  us  suppose  that  the  relative
motion of the objects is connected with this kind of wave. So the longitudinal wave is
connected  with  the  phase  velocity.  In  this  case  vector  product  of  velocities  of
longitudinal  and  transversal  waves  in  plate  elastic  medium  (field)  is  defined  by  the
inequality:

where n = 0,1,2,3,4. To be brief, the detailed deduction is omitted.

For  example,  if  the  core  of  the  Galaxy  rotates  with  equatorial  speed

.  It  coincides  with  the
then  the  speed  of  gravitational  interactions  equal  to 
experimental value of the speed of gravitational interactions in the Galaxy determined
according to data on co-rotational motion of the disc of the Galaxy on the distances till
10.3 kpc [8,9]. It  is  possible  to  describe  co-rotational  movement  of  the  Galaxy  as  the
solid state object only assuming that the retarding of interaction between the core and
other stars of the Galaxy is absent. In this picture the Sun is retarded only on one  itsr
radius relatively to the vector of exchange interaction with the Galaxy core. So the Sun
is sufficiently connected with the core of the Galaxy.

Besides  that,  the  model  proposed  describes  two  maximums  in  the  velocity
spectrum  of  the  stars.  It  was  shown  that  these  maximums  are  connected  only  with
fields  of  electrons  and  protons,  which  are  the  most  part  of  mass  of  the  Galaxy.
Theoretical estimations of  Dubrovsky gives equal result for the speed of gravitational
interaction (near

) [2].

Interaction  of  cosmic  objects  is  at  different  scales.  So  relative  velocities  of
them  will  be  also  different.  For  example,  the  fastest  planet  of  the  Solar  system  is  the
Mercury.  So  it  has  the  minimal  speed  of  gravitational  interaction.  Let  us  express  the
orbit velocity of the Mercury through the radius-vector of its orbit by the formula

This value is a little less than  Laplace  had  got.  But  this  speed  is  critical  in  the  Solar
system when the motion is stable. From this point of view one may consider the Solar
system as macrocondensate. Of course, velocities of gravitational interaction for other
bodies  of  the  Solar  system  will  be  higher  because  they  move  with  more  little  speeds.
For example, the speed of gravitational interaction for the Pluto is 1.89.105ñ.

Thew  other  important  question  is  about  nature  of  inertial  mass.  There  are  no
physical  theories  interpreting  the  physical  meaning  of  the  inertial  mass.  The  model
proposed give chance to explain it. The delay of gravitational field relatively the centre
of mass plays the role of inertia. The elastic medium  -
 gravitational field of the object
  is  weighed  down  under  action  of  the  external  force  accelerating  the  object.  In  this
case the negative sign of counteracting force is appeared automatically. It is important

that  the  gravitational  field  of  the  object  will  squeeze  round  it  when  its  speed  will
increase.  As  the  consequence,  the  decreasing  of  observed  inertial  mass  should  be
found. It would be of very interest to test this experimentally.

In  conclusion  let  us  note  about  one  more  serious  problem  of  gravity.  There
were a lot of experiments to define the Newton’s gravity law more exactly last years.
It  was  established  trustworthy  that  the  value  of  gravitational  constant  depends  on
distance  between  objects  [11].  Thus,  changing  distance  between  objects  from  some
centimeters till some meters  G  increases  on 1.1%.  This  effect  is  interpreted  with  the
so-called ‘fifth force’. In our mind, it is not necessary to attract the ‘fifth force’. Let us
assume  that  the  dynamical  part  in  the  gravity  law  (6)  is  valid  also  at  small  distances
taking  the  speed  of  heat  motion  of  molecules  of  the  bodies.  Therefore,  to  calculate
parameters of planet orbits one should take G with taking into account large distances
(Table 1. i.2.) [9].

Conclusion

Basic  problems  of  current  quantum  relativiatic  picture  of  the  world  can  be
solved  by  connecting  gravity  and  electromagnetism.  For  this  purpose  basic  ideas  of
Newton,  Laplace,  Mossotti,  Maxwell,  Heavisude  were  restored.  Equations  of  de
Broglie have got a new physical sense. Principles of relativity were also reconsidered.
We had to refuse from  geometrophysical approach in general relativity and to consider
the  set  of  Lorentz  transformations  in  special  relativity  taking  into  account  relative
motion  of  the  objects  and  their  phase  state.  In  the  model  proposed  matter  in  the
absolute  vacuum  defines  the  structure  of  the  space.  Newton  had  the  continuous  and
linear model of space. The Einstein model of space is continuous and nonlinear. In the
model  proposed  the  space  is  discrete  and  nonlinear.  Description  of  gravitational  field
in  this  scheme  is  based  on  superposition  of  two-dimensional  objects:  layers-discs.  In
such presentation interaction between objects is by waves moving along the layers of
the space. To describe these waves linear second order differential equations are used.
They  gives that the speed of gravitational interaction is function of relative motion of
c4a   the  speed
the  objects.  At  the  limited  speed  of  motion  of  condensed  objects

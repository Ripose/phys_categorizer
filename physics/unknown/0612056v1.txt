Several  fundamental  properties  of  real  complex  networks,  such  as  the  small-world  effect,  the 

scale-free degree distribution, and recently discovered topological fractal structure, have presented 

the  possibility  of  a  unique  growth  mechanism  and  allow  for  uncovering  universal  origins  of 

collective  behaviors.  However,  highly  clustered  scale-free  network,  with  power-law  degree 

distribution,  or  small-world  network  models,  with  exponential  degree  distribution,  are  not 

self-similarity.  We  investigate  networks  growth  mechanism  of  the  branching-deactivated 

geographical  attachment  preference  that  learned  from  certain  empirical  evidence  of  social 

behaviors. It yields high clustering and spectrums of degree distribution ranging from algebraic to 

exponential, average shortest path length ranging from linear to logarithmic. We observe that the 

present  networks  fit  well  with  small-world  graphs  and  scale-free  networks  in  both  limit  cases 

(exponential  and  algebraic  degree  distribution  respectively),  obviously  lacking  self-similar 

property  under  a  length-scale  transformation.  Interestingly,  we  find  perfect  topological  fractal 

structure  emerges  by  a  mixture  of  both algebraic  and  exponential degree  distributions  in  a  wide 

range  of  parameter  values.  The  results  present  a  reliable  connection  among  small-world  graphs, 

scale-free  networks  and  topological  fractal  networks,  and  promise  a  natural  way  to  investigate 

universal origins of collective behaviors.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Many artificial and natural complex systems are conveniently modeled with a network, where 

constituent ingredients and interactions are represented with vertices and links, respectively [1-3]. 

Systems  such  as the  Internet [4,5],  the World  Wide Web  (WWW)  [6],  social  networks [7],  food 

webs [8], and biological networks [9,10] etc. can be represented as a graph. Strikingly, many of 

these  networks  have  complex  topological  properties  and  dynamical  features  that  cannot  be 

accounted for by classical graph modeling [11]. Recent studies indicate that the realistic networks 

exhibit some common topological features by a short average distance as random networks, large 

clustering as regular lattices (small-world effect) [12], a power-law degree distribution (scale-free 

property)  [13],  and  hierarchical  modularity  [14,15].  More  recently, 

the  emergence  of 

self-similarity in complex networks [16], widely believed as the fractal small-world dichotomy in 

previous studies [12,17], raises the fundamental question of networks evolution. In this letter, we 

focus on acceptably social behaviors forced growing network mechanism for a profound view on 

understanding such common features of realistic complex systems. 

The recent discovery of fractal scaling and topological self-similarity in several real networks 

suggests a common self-organization dynamics [16]. Fractal scaling stands for the scaling relation

size with  a  finite  fractal  dimension

[16].  However,  most  of  the  random  network  models 

Bd

B(cid:65)

proposed  yet  are  not  fractal.  Until  very  recently,  Song  et  al.  present  self-similar  dynamical 

evolution of complex networks by the inverse renormalization procedure with all of the properties 

of the network being invariant under time evolution [18]. It has been shown that the key principle 

that  gives  rise  to  fractal  structure  of  networks  is  a  strong  effective  disassortativity  between  the 

hubs  on  all  length  scales.  In  Ref.  [18],  Model  I  produces  a  scale-free,  small  world  network  but 

without fractal topology, while Model II leads to a scale-free network with a fractal topology but 

not the small-world effect. They suggest growing fractal small-world and scale-free networks from 

an indirect way of stochastic combination of Model I and Model II. Goh et al. present an in silico 

model  with  both  fractal  scaling  and  scale-free  degree  distribution  based  on  the  multiplicative 

branching  tree.  Note  also  that  this  fractal  trees  are  not  small  world,  but  by  introducing  a  small 

number  of  global  shortcuts  yields  small-world  property  [19].  Different  from  these  growth 

mechanisms,  the  present  model  can  grow  fractal  small-world  and  mixed  scaling  networks 

naturally. 

In  the  present  work,  we  address  the  study  of  growing  self-similar  scale-free  networks  from 

empirical evidence of social behaviors: (1) in citation networks, it has been shown [20,21] that the 

probability for a paper to obtain a new link (citation) is an increasing function of the number of 

links  the  node  already  has  (growth  and  preferential  attachment).  Papers  cease  to  receive  links, 

because  their  contents  are  outdated  or  summarized  in  review  papers  (aging  or  deactivation 

mechanism) [22-25]. (2) each of the authors and papers is assigned a topic, and authors read, cite, 

produce  papers  only  in  their  own  topics  (roughly  speaking,  geographical  restriction  or  limited 

information) [23,26-28]. (3) more new research branches will be created with deeper studying in 

 

 

certain  field  (branching).  We  present  a  network  model  with  the  geographical  attachment 

preference  and  branching-deactivation  mechanisms.  We  demonstrate  that,  in  a  wide  range  of 

adjusting  parameter,  it  account  for  small  world  property,  power  law  degree  distribution, 

hierarchical organization, and topological fractal. 

II. THE MODEL 

The  present  model  starts  from  an  initial  configuration  of

active,  completely  connected 

0N

vertices.  Each  vertex  of  the  present  networks  can  be  in  two  different  states,  either  active  or 

inactive [24,25]. The growth of the model is shown in Fig. 1.

FIG. 1. New vertex creation and geographical attachment. In the new vertex creation step (a) the 

new  node is  created  or  established  by  one  of  the  existing  active  nodes u and  links  to  it.  In  the 

v

v
geographical attachment step (b) the new vertex chooses a vertex w in the neighborhood of u . It 

is worth noting that a vertex receives links during the time it is active, and once inactive it will not 

receive  links  any  longer.  Moreover,  new  vertices  have  their  connectivity  influenced  by 

geographical  constraints  and  it  forms  links  locally  to  the  active  vertex and

u

1m −

active  nearest 

neighbors  of u .  The  filled  and  unfilled  circles  stand  for  inactive  and  active  nodes  respectively. 

×

symbolizes  “not  allowed to attach to”  (either  since the vertex  is not an  active neighbor  of  the 

vertex u , or that an edge already exists). 

At  each  subsequent  discrete  time  step  we  grow  the  network  according  to  the  following 

prescription: (1) A new node v is created or established by one of the existing active nodesu and 

links to it. (2) The new node makes another

v

1m − links to 

1m − active nearest neighbors of u . 

(3)  Activate 

the  new  node

then  deactivate  each  active  vertex  with

III. TOPOLOGICAL FRACTAL INTRODUCED BY MIXED DEGREE DISTRIBUTION 

The  overall  degree  distribution

( )N k

can  be  obtained  analytically  for  the  present  model, 

considering  the  continuous  limit  of

.  Let  us  first  derive  the  degree  distribution

p k t
( , )

of  the 

k

active nodes at time . At time t , a node with degree

t

k m= is added to the network, and if it links 

to a previously existing node i , then

k

i

k→ +
i

. Each preexisting active node is equally likely to 

be connected to the new node, and therefore the probability that a given preexisting active node 

has  its  degree  increased  by  1  is

.  We  define

G k t
( , )

as  the  number  of  active  nodes 

m
tμ+ −

with  degree

at  time .  For

k >

process in which an active node with degree

degree k at  time is  connected  to  the  new  node  and  not  deactivated  at  time

represents  the  new  vertex  with  degree m .  The  degree  distribution  of  active  nodes  at  time t is

that the distribution for

B. Topological self-similarity 

The emergence of topological fractal in complex networks presents the possibility of a unique 

growth mechanism and allows for uncovering universal origins of collective behaviors [16-19]. It 

springs  a  fundamental  question  for  our  basic  understanding  of  the  organization  of  complex 

networked systems, since the celebrated properties of small-world property and scale-free degree 

distribution seemed to be incompatible with self-similar features of networks [17,29]. To unfold 

the self-similar properties of networks, the fractal dimension is calculated using a ‘box-counting’ 

algorithm  [16].  In  the  algorithm,  the  renormalization  scheme  titles  a  network  of 

N

nodes 

with

N (cid:65)
(
B

B

)

boxes. The boxes contain nodes separated by linear size

, the shortest path length 

B(cid:65)

between nodes, and each box is successively replaced by a virtual node until the whole network is 

reduced  to  a  single  node.  Fractal  networks  lead  to  a  scaling  relation

,  with  an 

exponent that is given by the fractal dimension

. Bd

Using ‘box-counting’ algorithm, it has been observed that several real networks, such as WWW 

(

Bd =

4.1

), actor networks (

Bd =

6.3

), protein interaction networks of E. coli (

Bd =

2.3

) and H. 

sapiens  (

Bd =

2.3

),  cellular  networks  of  A.  fulgidus,  E.  coli,  C.  elegans  (

Bd =

3.5

),  and  the 

genetic  regulatory  network  of  two  organisms  S.  cerevisiae  (

Bd =

5.1

)  and  E.  coli  (

Bd =

3.4

), 

can have a fractal structure [16,29]. However, most of the random network models proposed yet 

are not fractal. Until very recently, Song et al. present self-similar dynamical evolution of complex 

networks by the inverse renormalization procedure with all of the properties of the network being 

invariant under time evolution. In Ref. [18], Model I produces a scale-free, small world network 

but without fractal topology, while Model II leads to a scale-free network with a fractal topology 

but not the small-world effect. They suggest growing fractal small-world and scale-free networks 

from an indirect way of stochastic combination of Model I and Model II. Goh et al. present an in 

silico model with both fractal scaling and scale-free degree distribution based on the multiplicative 

branching  tree.  Note  also  that  this  fractal  trees  are  not  small  world,  but  by  introducing  a  small 

number  of  global  shortcuts  yields  small-world  property  [19].  Different  from  these  growth 

mechanisms,  the  present  model  can  grow  fractal  small-world  and  scale-free  networks  naturally. 

We apply box-covering method to the present model, and the log-log plot of

with

IV. SMALL-WORLD EFFECT OF THE PRESENT FRACTAL NETWORK 

A. Clustering coefficient 

By definition, the clustering coefficient

of a vertex is the ration of the total number of existing 

C

connections  between  all  its

nearest  neighbors  and  the  number

k k
(

−

1) /

2

of  all  possible 

k

connections between them. We can go beyond the degree distribution and compute the clustering 

coefficient

( )C k

as a function of the vertex degree

. For this quantity we can perform an analytic 

k

calculation for any value of

for the provided model. In the present model, new edge is created 

m

between  the  active  vertex  and  the  added  one,  and  the  other

1m − edges  are  linked  to  its  nearest 

neighbors. The total number of connections between all its nearest neighbors increases by

k

1m −

 

every  time  when  the  degree

increases  by  one.  Obviously,

k

ik

and

ie k
( )

remain  constant  for 

inactive vertices and increase only for active vertices. Therefore, the dynamics of

This expression indicates that the local clustering coefficient

( )C k

scales as

1k −

, indicating that 

the present networks have a hierarchical topology, which is a fundamental characteristic of many 

complex systems, such as th4e World Wide Web, actor network, and the Internet at domain level 

[15]. In Fig. 5(a), we plot the clustering coefficient as a function of the vertex degree obtained for 

present model, which coincides with the analytical expression in Eq.(8). 

The clustering coefficient C of the whole network is the average of

( )C k

over all vertices, i.e.,

between 0.66 and 0.76 for

depend  on  the  network  size

drastically with growing system size.

independent realizations. The average degree is

B. Characteristic path length 

Another fundamental topological feature of complex networks is identified by the scaling of the 

average shortest path length among vertices. In Fig. 6 we show the average shortest path length L  

of the provided model as the functions of deactivate rateμand the system size

N

. For

1μ= , i.e., 

power-law degree distribution, the average shortest path length grows linearly,

L N∝

, the same 

behavior observed in one-dimensional regular lattice. Ref. [30] shows that the networks’ topology, 

for such a special case, is similar to a chain of dense clusters locally connected. Since the number 

of active nodes

remains unchanged in growing networks, on one hand, those active nodes with 

m

long  life-time  have  a  possibility  to  develop  a  hub,  and  once  they  are  deactivated,  they  will  not 

receive any further links. On the other hand, the chains will grow with those bridge nodes, rapidly 

deactivated active nodes, until a new dense cluster is developed. The growing mechanism, without 

effective shortcuts that are able to reduce the path length, leads to a lack of small-world property. 

In  contrast,  the  case  of

0μ= ,  i.e.,  exponential  degree  distribution,  shows  a  slow  (logarithmic) 

increase of the average path length of the network with the total number of nodes,

L ∝ N
ln

. Ref. 

[28] shows why

L grows more slowly than

N

although the added node links locally to the existing 

nodes. In such a special case, all existing nodes remain active in the growth of networks. The older 

nodes that have once been nearest neighbors will be pushed apart as newer nodes are inserted, thus, 

have a large number of newer nodes between them. Therefore, the edges that link the old nodes 

will server as shortcuts, responsible for a short average path length. For networks with small value 

of

μ，the initial links between the older nodes, which will remain active for a period long enough 

that newer nodes will be inserted successively, will more likely to be the long-range connections. 

On  the  opposite  side,  few  shortcuts  will  be  formed  for  large  values  ofμ,  and  the  average  path 

length increases. The characteristic path length 

)L μ   varying with  1 μ−   is shown in Fig. 6(a). 

(

In  case  of 

μ∈

[0, 0.9)

,  the  average  path  length L   increases  slowly  until  an  emergence  of  a 

jump  when 

μ∈

(0.9,1]

,  meanwhile  the  clustering  coefficient  remains  almost  unchanged. 

Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 6(b), we find an almost logarithmic growth of the average shortest 

path length with system size for

μ∈

[0, 0.8)

. This in addition to the high clustering yields typical 

of the small-world effect.

V. CONCLUSION 

We  have  defined  a  simple  model  of  self-organizing  networks  based  on  empirical  evidence  of 

social behaviors. The model is growing on two coupled reasonable mechanisms: the geographical 

attachment  preference  and  branching  structured  deactivation  mechanisms.  We  focus  on  the 

connection between the mixed degree distribution and topological self-similarity, and also analyze 

the  structural  properties  such  as  clustering  coefficient,  and  average  shortest  path  length 

systemically.  The  network  yields  a  spectrum  of  degree  distribution  ranging  from  algebraic  to 

exponential  and  average  shortest  path  length  ranging  from  linear  to  logarithmic  simply  by 

changing  a  control  parameter:  deactivate  rate,  introducing  the  topological  fractal  property  in  a 

wide range of deactivate rate. In both limit cases of 

0μ= (exponential degree distribution) and 

1μ= (power-law degree distribution), the networks are not fractal. Whenμapproaches to 0, the 

networks  feature  power-law  degree  distribution  and  high  clustering,  but  the  average  path  length 

depends  linearly  on  system  size.  Whileμapproaches  to  1,  the  networks  are  characterized  by 

small-world effect, but possess an exponential degree distribution. In general, the network yields 

mixed degree distribution, topological fractal structure and small-world effect in a wide range of 

deactivate  rate.  The  present  networks  growth  mechanism  presents  a  reliable  connection  among 

small-world  graphs,  scale-free  networks  and  fractal  topological  networks,  and  gives  a  further 

insight into understanding the origin of complex networks.

Abstract. A first deception of QM on H already appears in one-center integrals for two-center systems [G. 
Van Hooydonk, physics/0511115]. In reality, full QM is a theory for chiral systems but the QM 
establishment was wrong footed with a permutation of reference frames. With chiral quantum mechanics 
(CQM), the theoretical ban on natural H must be lifted as soon as possible. 
 
 
 
antihydrogen by a misjudgment on the proton-antiproton attraction, which resides primarily in one-
center integrals [1]. In ab initio calculations for this molecular cation [2], the secular equation  
 
 
 
gives symmetric and antisymmetric solutions 

For molecular cations HH+and HH+, we proved recently that QM is inconsistent on

Positional equivalence secures that HAA=HBB but this seemingly straightforward conclusion can be 
deceptive. Mathematically, their equality is proved with

giving identical results for orbitals, centered at either nucleus since the same Hamiltonian is used 
for molecular cations HH+ and H+H. Hence, the identity 
 
can only be obtained by inverting (a permutation of) the reference frame for the two centers of the species, although a 
permutation always has symmetry-consequences. With chemistry, a permutation for reversible reaction (5) 
 
refers to a proton perturbing a fixed atom and to an atom perturbing a fixed proton. The Hamiltonian for 
hydrogenic cation HH+ however changes sign for antihydrogenic cation HH+ obeying reaction 
 

H + H+ ↔ (H+H;HH+) 

H + H+ ↔ HH+

(i) Scaling rAB with Da0, gives scaled Coulomb interactions ±1/D and can be used for a 

Equivalent reactions (5a) are described with equivalent reference frames, one subject to a permutation 
but, in reality, only one reference frame is allowed. If a parity operator is needed, this is readily 
provided with (5b). These elementary facts lead to a misconception about proton-antiproton attraction, if 
the QM machinery were not checked for permutations (5a), i.e. for chiral behavior (5b).  
 
graphical justification for (4). The triangular 1/D graphs in Fig. 1a and 1b have advantages to 
become clear below. Reminding (5), H+ starts perturbing atom H at 0,0 (in a D-graph, this is at 
infinite separation 0,∞). Fig. 1a and 1b illustrate a change of subscripts A and B in (3) with the 
notation AB+ for HH+ (5). Fig. 1a for system B+...A in (5) gives (3a), reproduced identically in 
Fig. 1b for A+...B in (5) and (3b). Identical triangles prove the validity of QM result (4).  
But at this stage, convention enters the scene. To bridge the gap of one half Hartree between the 
cation and the atom, two options are allowed: going from atom to cation, repulsion or +1/D can 
be used but then going from cation to atom requires attraction or –1/D. In QM, the leading 
terms in HAA and HBB (3) are WH+e2/rAB [1,2], where WH=-½e2/a0. Anyone would conclude at 
this stage that the energy of the molecular hydrogen cation HH+ or H+H is based exclusively on 
classical Coulomb proton-proton repulsion +e2/rAB. This is the long-standing premise of QM that HH+ 
and H+H are exotic systems and must be forbidden in nature, due to their exotic proton-antiproton 
attraction –e2/rAB [1]. This attraction contradicts standard analytical QM result (3), e.g. its 
unavoidable Coulomb repulsion +e2/rAB [1]. However, the Coulomb duality above remains and is 
easily proved by scaling (3). Standard scaling with +½e2/a0 gives –1+2/D of repulsive Coulomb type 
for QM result (3) but equally valid scaling with -½e2/a0 would give +1-2/D of attractive Coulomb

(ii) This brings us to the graph with a single reference frame in Fig. 2 without permutation. 

type, characteristic for (5b). Choosing the repulsive option and rejecting or forbidding the attractive one, as suggested 
by QM, seems plausible but must not be absolutely valid. With (3), QM succeeded in wrong footing most 
of us on the character of the nucleon interaction, which led to the veto for natural H and its 
systems [3]. This seemingly obvious but certainly not absolutely valid conclusion finds its origin in the 
permutation of the reference frame as in (3a) and (3b), as illustrated in Fig. 1a and 1b and as 
proved with scaling. A permutation of a reference frame must always have consequences for 
symmetry. For an x-axis, a permutation would transform the +x semi-axis in the –x semi-axis, just 
like the parity operator appearing when bridging the energy gap with repulsion +1/D and 
attraction –1/D. This ambiguity with Coulomb’s law, just like with the permutation, must be removed. If QM 
deals correctly with a permutation of reference frames, it must also use rather than forbid Coulomb 
attraction –1/D, typical for (5b) [1]. 
 
All interactions, including that of the nucleons, needed to bridge gap 0,-1 must have switched 
sign with a displacement of the lepton from one to the other center, while remaining in the same 
reference frame for the nucleons. The surfaces of the triangles in Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b are exactly equal to 
these of Fig. 2. But the 2 triangles in Fig. 2 are complementary: they are mutually exclusive left- and right-
handed triangles. With Lord Kelvin’s definition of chiral behavior [4], these two triangles can never be 
made to coincide without leaving the plane. Hence, the left-right difference in Fig. 2 gives away a discrete 
transition from repulsive to attractive forces (or vice versa), seemingly not acknowledged for by (4) or 
by Fig. 1a and 1b, where it is disguised by a permutation of the reference frame. If in Fig. 2, the left-handed 
triangle for B+...A (5) stands for repulsive interaction +1/D, as in QM with the proton-proton 
repulsion +e2/rAB, then the right-handed triangle for B...A+, also in (5), can only stand for attractive 
–1/D or for proton-antiproton attraction –e2/rAB, forbidden by the false man-made QM premises and by 
conventional physics at large [3]. This proves the reality of reaction (5b) even for QM, since pair 
H;H is chiral, due to a permutation of charges, just like cation pair HH+; HH+ [1]. 
 
proton-antiproton attraction appears already at the level of the two one-center integrals J, defined as 

The rigor of QM does not allow fooling with permutations. In fact [1], the forbidden Coulomb 

 J =∫ψA(-e2/rB)ψAdτ≡∫ψB(-e2/rA)ψBdτ= -e2/rAB + other repulsive terms... 

 (6) 

Full QM proves a perfect theoretical framework to deal with chiral systems and can readily be called 

Although only repulsive proton-proton Coulomb term +e2/rAB appears explicitly in (3), full QM 
(6) rightly shows that the leading term in J contains the so-called forbidden Coulomb proton-antiproton 
attraction –e2/rAB as expected from the left-right symmetry in Fig. 2. With intersecting triangles, a 
Coulomb cusp is generated when repulsive –1+1/D and attractive –1/D interactions are in 
equilibrium, which is impossible with Fig. 1. Translation in a fixed reference frame may leave the 
laws of physics intact; a permutation of an axis creates a parity operator. In higher order, QM 
also deals with two-center integrals but the necessary algebraic Coulomb switch already appears 
at the level of one-center integrals as in Fig. 2. This Coulomb switch plays a dominant role when 
(6) is introduced in (3) but, due to the symmetry of the primary Coulomb forces, it is less visible 
in the observed PEC (potential energy curve) of the molecular cation [1].  
 
chiral quantum mechanics (CQM). In this way, one prevents QM from becoming deceptive on proton-antiproton 
attraction in natural systems like the molecular hydrogen cation [1], the neutral hydrogen molecule [3] 
as well as the atomic species hydrogen [5]. In any case, the theoretical ban on natural H, persistently but 
wrongly promoted to the status of a QM premise, must be lifted as soon as possible, even while wrong artificial 
H experiments are in progress, as argued in [6].

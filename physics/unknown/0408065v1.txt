We present the results of the detailed experimental study of multiple ionization of Ne and Ar 

by 25  and 7 fs laser pulses. For Ne the highly correlated “instantaneous” emission of up to 

four electrons is triggered by a recollisional electron impact, whereas in multiple ionization of 

Ar different mechanisms, involving field ionization steps and recollision-induced excitations, 

play a major role. Using few-cycle pulses we are able to suppress those processes that occur 

on time scales longer than one laser cycle.

Since the first experimental observation of doubly charged ions produced by intense 

laser  fields  [1],  many-electron  dynamics  in  laser-induced  ionization  has  become  one  of  the 

hottest  topics  in  the  field  of  laser-matter  interactions.  It  was  soon  found  out  [2]  that  for 

linearly polarized light the yields of doubly and multiply charged ions exceed those predicted 

for independent successive removals of two or more electrons by many orders of magnitude. 

The  origin  of  this  enhancement  (which  was  called  ‘non-sequential’multiple  ionization) 

remained  controversial  until  2000  when  the  first  measurements  of  recoil  ion  momentum 

distributions  [3,4]  along  with  the  suppression  of  the  enhancement  for  elliptically  polarized 

light  (see,  e.g  [5])  provided  convincing  evidences  in  favour  of  the  so-called  ‘recollision’ 

model [6]. As illustrated in Fig. 1, in this model an electron that tunnels out of the atom is 

then  driven  back  to  its  parent  ion  and  knocks  out  another  electron.  This  mechanism  was 

found  to  be  the  only  one  compatible  with  the  characteristic  double  peak  structure  and  the 

minimum  at  zero 

in 

the 

ion-momentum  distributions  along 

the  field  polarization 

(‘longitudinal’) direction observed in the experiments. Indeed, if an electron or ion is born at 

the maximum of the electric field, it acquires essentially zero drift momentum and the final 

momentum  along  the  field  polarization  direction  is  small.  Therefore,  in  the  case  of  single 

ionization  or  sequential  tunneling  of  several  electrons  the  ion  momentum  distribution 

displays  a  maximum  at  zero.  In  contrast,  ions  that  are  produced  at  phases  close  to  a  zero-

crossing  of  the  electric  field,  where  the  returning  electron  has  enough  energy  to  ionize  its 

parent  ion,  acquire  large  drift  momenta,  resulting  in  a  final  momentum  distribution  with  a 

distinct minimum at zero [7]. 

The  non-sequential  double  ionization  was  reported  for  all  rare  gas  atoms  [2,5,8]. 

However,  a  well-pronounced  double  peak  structure  in  the  longitudinal  momentum 

distribution of the doubly charged ions was observed only for Ne, whereas for He and Ar a 

considerable fraction of ions was found to have small momenta [9]. This difference has been 

explained to be due to the contribution of another mechanism of electron-electron correlation, 

namely recollision induced excitation followed by subsequent field ionization (RESI) [9-11]. 

Here the returning electron excites the parent ion which is then ionized via tunneling in one 

of the subsequent cycles of the oscillating laser field (see Fig. 1). The latter step most likely 

occurs  near  one  of  the  field  maxima,  resulting  in  small  ion  drift  momenta  and,  thus,  in  a 

‘filling  of  the  valley’  in  the  momentum  distributions.  Estimations  of  the  cross  sections  for 

collision-induced  ionization/excitation  [9]  as  well  as  the  analysis  of  correlated  electron 

momenta  [10-12]  showed  that  RESI  plays  a  decisive  role  for  He  and  Ar,  whereas  for  Ne 

recollision induced electron-impact ionization clearly dominates. 

The  aforementioned  enhancement  of  ion  yields  was  observed  also  for  cases  where 

more  than  two  electrons  are  ionized  [2,8,13-15].  The  description  of  multiple  ionization 

represents  even  a  greater  challenge  to  theory,  not  only  because  of  the  increased  number  of 

reaction  partners,  but  also  due  to  the  larger  variety  of  the  possible  pathways  leading  to  the 

same final state, including different combinations of sequential and non-sequential processes 

[16,17], and the possibility of multiple excitations. For triple ionization of Ar it was shown 

that  the  neglect  of  specific  nonsequential  channels  leads  to  large  discrepancies  between 

measured and calculated yields of multiply charged ions [16]. However, yield measurements 

alone  do  not  allow  one  to  determine  particular  mechanisms  explicitly.  In  this  paper  we 

present differential experimental data on  multiple (up to  fourfold) ionization of Ne  and Ar, 

which  allowed  us  to  disentangle  different  multiple  ionization  mechanisms,  since  they 

populate  different  regions  of  the  final  state  momentum  space.  We  confirm  our  findings 

presenting  the  very  first  experimental  results  on  double  and  multiple  ionization  with  few  –

cycle (7 fs) laser pulses.  

In order to identify the mechanisms contributing to multiple ionization, we measured 

the  longitudinal  momentum  distributions  of  the  recoil  ions.  To  relate  the  observed  ion 

momenta to certain multiple ionization  pathways it is convenient to consider the  individual 

emitted  electrons  since  their  sum  momentum  balances  the  ion  momentum.  For  any 

combination  of  sequential  and  non-sequential  processes,  two  classes  of  electrons  can  be 

distinguished: those emitted via field (tunnel) ionization (eT) from the ground or excited state, 

and electrons emerging from a recollision process (eR). The final momentum of an ion with 

charge state n is given by:

As can be seen from Fig.1, electrons emitted via tunneling acquire a small drift momentum 

and, thus, give only a small contribution to the final sum momentum (1). Hence, the width of 

the  ion  momentum  distribution  is  mainly  defined  by  the  contribution  of  electrons  emitted 

simultaneously  via  a  recollision  process,  which  happens  preferentially  close  to  a  zero-

crossing  of  the  oscillating  electric  field.  Electrons  which  are  set  free  exactly  at  a  zero-

crossing  gain  a  maximum  drift  momentum  of 

pU2

  (where  Up  is  the  so-called 

ponderomotive  potential,  Up  =  E2/4ω2,  E  is  the  electric  field  strength  and  ω  is  the  light 

frequency). Thus, an upper boundary for the most probable final longitudinal momentum of 

an n-charged ion can be estimated to be 

p

max =

2

pUn

, which corresponds to the case where 

all  electrons  are  set  free  simultaneously  during  a  recollision  event.  Any  other  sequence  of 

processes  like  subsequent  tunneling  of  two  electrons  followed  by  recollision-induced 

ionization as a last step will lead to considerably smaller momenta [17]. 

The measurements were performed using a new “reaction microscope” [18] designed 

to  meet  the  specific  requirement  of  the  experiments  with  high-intensity  lasers  (see  [11]  for 

details). We used linearly polarized radiation of a Kerr-lens mode locked Ti:sapphire laser at 

795 nm wavelength with 25 fs pulse width (FWHM). To generate few-cycle pulses they were 

spectrally broadened in a gas-filled hollow fiber and then compressed to 6-7 fs (FWHM) by 

chirped mirrors and a prism compressor. The laser beam was focused to a spot size of ~ 7 µm 

on  the  collimated  supersonic  gas  jet  in  the  ultra-high  vacuum  chamber  (2.10−11  mbar). 

Created reaction fragments were guided to two position-sensitive channel plate detectors by 

weak  electric  (1V/cm)  and  magnetic  (5G)  fields  applied  along  the  laser  polarization  axis. 

From the time-of-flight and position on the detectors the full momentum vectors of the recoil 

ions and electrons were calculated. 

In Fig. 2 the longitudinal momentum distributions of Ne2-4+ ions obtained with 25 fs 

800 nm laser pulses are presented. At an intensity of 1.5.1015 W/cm2 the distributions of both 

Ne2+ and Ne3+ exhibit the characteristic double-peak structure (Fig. 2a), a clear signature of 

recollision-induced  non-sequential  ionization.  At  higher  intensity,  Ne2+  ions  are  produced 

sequentially via two independent tunnel ionization events, and the corresponding momentum 

distribution is a Gaussian with a maximum at zero (Fig. 2b). The momentum distributions of 

Ne3+ and Ne4+ ions at the same intensity, however, still exhibit a clear double-peak structure, 

with  almost  no  ions  created  at  zero  momentum  (Fig.  2b,  2c).  The  spectra  spreads  even 

slightly  beyond  the  classical  cut-offs maxp

represented  by  the  arrows.  Such  high  recoil  ion 

momenta can be obtained only when all of the emitted electrons participate in the recollision 

event.  Contributions  beyond maxp

  reflect  a  probability  for  the  returning  electron  to  be 

backscattered on the parent ion and, thus, getting a momentum higher then the maximum drift 

momentum.  However,  the  probability  of  the  backscattering  is  rather  small,  and  a  region  of 

lower momenta is kinematically favoured [17]. 

Thus,  non-sequential  enhancement  of  double,  triple  and  fourfold  ionization  of  Ne 

proceeds mainly via a direct recollision-induced process involving up to four electrons. Very 

surprisingly,  the  dominant  pathway  of  the  Ne3+  and  Ne4+  ions  production  does  not  change 

when  the  double  ionization  passes  from  non-sequential  to  sequential  regime.  This  highly 

correlated  electron  emission  occurs  on  a  sub-laser  cycle  time  scale,  and  all  processes  that 

occur on longer time scales seem to give a negligible contribution.  

Inspecting the momentum distributions of multiply charged Ar ions created by 25 fs 

laser  pulses  (Fig.  3),  we  observe  a  completely  different  behaviour.  In  the  intensity  regime 

where the  yield measurements showed a qualitatively similar ‘non-sequential’ enhancement 

for Ne and Ar [8,16], striking differences in the momentum distributions are observed. The 

Ar3+ distributions exhibit only a shallow minimum at zero, whereas for Ar4+ ions we do not 

observe  a  double-peak  structure  at  all,  pointing  to  other  mechanisms  to  be  of  importance. 

Considering  the  width  of  the  spectra,  one  can  see  that  for  Ar  the  data  lie  well  within  the 

pUn2

limits.  Moreover,  at  the  intensity  where  both  double  and  triple  ionization  of  Ar 

occurs predominantly non-sequentially (Fig. 3a), the momentum distributions of doubly and 

triply charged ions are very close: the Ar3+ spectrum is only slightly broader (compare with 

Fig.  2a).  The  most  likely  mechanism  of  triple  ionization  thus  involves  the  sequential 

production of Ar2+ with subsequent recollision. Then, the contribution of the first tunnelled 

electron  in  the  momentum  sum  (1)  will  lead  only  to  the  slight  broadening  of  the  final  ion 

momentum distribution.  

Since  the  ion-momentum  distributions  show  very  similar  behaviour  for  double  and 

triple ionization, one might assume that similar mechanisms are active, and differences in the 

shape  of  multiple  ionization  spectra  for  Ne  and  Ar  might  be  attributed  to  the  different 

importance  of  the  RESI  mechanism,  as  it  has  been  convincingly  demonstrated  for  double 

ionization [9]. To confirm this, we present the first experimental data on multiple ionization 

by  few-cycle  laser  pulses.  The  RESI  pathway  should  be  suppressed  when  few-cycle  pulses 

are used. Indeed, the probability of the ion excited by the rescattered electron to be ionized 

depends on the intensity of the laser field at the subsequent maxima. In contrast, any direct 

(e,ne) process is not influenced at all by the pulse length if it occurs at the first return of the 

electron. Comparing the results obtained with 25 and 7 fs pulses (Fig. 4) we observe that the 

momentum  distribution  for  double  ionization  of  Ne,  which  is  dominated  by  recollision-

induced (e,2e) process, do not depend on the pulse length, whereas for all three charge states 

of  Ar  there  is  a  significant  modification  of  the  spectra.  For  7  fs  pulse  RESI  contributions 

resulting  in  ions  with  small  longitudinal  momenta  are  suppressed,  and  the  characteristic 

double-hump structure is restored, making the shape of the spectra closer to those of Ne. A 

similar  depletion  of  the  region  around  zero  momentum  could  be  also  caused  by  the 

suppression of the sequential ionization from the ground state. However, the contribution of 

purely  sequential production of Ar2+, Ar3+and Ar4+ at the intensities of Fig. 4b, 4c,  and 4d, 

respectively, is still a small fraction of the total yield [16], and thus, can not be responsible 

for the changes observed.  

In  conclusion,  we  found 

that  essentially  only  one  pathway  based  on 

the 

“instantaneous” interaction between up to four electrons dominates multiple electron removal 

from Ne. Surprisingly, triply and fourfold charged ions are predominately produced by highly 

correlated  sub-cycle  few-electron  emission  even  at  those  intensities  where  the  dominating 

mechanism  of  double  ionization  does  not  involve  electron  correlation.  In  Ar,  instead, 

different types of less correlated multi-electron pathways involving the RESI mechanism and 

cascades  of  sequential  and  non-sequential  processes  are  important.  Especially  interesting  is 

the fact that the atomic structure plays an important role even at intensities well above 1015 

W/cm2  by  efficiently  “selecting”  the  most  effective  dynamical  pathway  to  multiple 

ionization, i.e. the coupling between several atomic electrons and the intense laser field. 

The  demonstrated  possibility  to  influence  many-electron  dynamics  by  changing  the 

laser  pulse  parameters  can  allow  for  a  control  over  various  field-induced  phenomena.  In 

particular,  multiple  ionization  of  Ne,  which  occurs  essentially  via  only  one  clear  pathway, 

represents a sensitive tool to study the carrier envelope phase effects [19], since the returning 

electron can have enough energy to induce multiple ionization only if it was born at certain 

initial phase. Recently the production of ~ 5 fs laser pulses with stabilized carrier envelope 

phase was reported [20], and use of such pulses can allow one to manipulate the details of the 

recollision process.

Figure 1. Mechanisms of strong-field ionization. If the electric field changes with time as 

E(t) = E0sin ωt, an electron which is set free at the time t acquires a final drift momentum of 

Pdrift(t) = q/ω E0cos(ωt). Thus, an electron created near the maximum of the field (1) emerges 

with zero momentum after the laser pulse has gone. In sequential double ionization (4) 

tunneling happens twice leading to small momenta of the produced ion, which balances the 

electron sum-momentum. If an electron tunnels out shortly after the field maximum it can 

recollide with its parent ion where it may either excite (2) or directly knock out (3) another 

atomic electron. In the latter case both electrons acquire a large net momentum of up 

to

PU2

 each. The corresponding final ion momentum displays clear maxima. In cases 

where an electronic excitation occurs during recollision only the slowed down projectile 

electron acquires a namable momentum from the laser field, while the excited electron, which 

is field ionized at a later time, appears as a slow electron. This pathway (RESI) gives rise to 

ion-momentum distributions slightly broader than for the sequential case.

Abstract 

 
This paper deals with the comparison between thermal and Fission Enhanced Diffusion (FED) 

of uranium into zirconia, representative of the inner face of cladding tubes. The experiments 

under  irradiation  are  performed  at  the  Institut  Laue  Langevin  (ILL)  in  Grenoble  using  the 
Lohengrin spectrometer. A thin 235UO2 layer in direct contact with an oxidized zirconium foil 
is irradiated in the ILL high flux reactor. The fission product flux is about 1011 ions cm-2 s-1 

and the target temperature is measured by an IR pyrometer. A model is proposed to deduce an 

apparent uranium diffusion coefficient in zirconia from the energy distribution broadening of 
two selected fission products. It is found to be equal to 10-15 cm2 s-1 at 480°C and compared to 

uranium thermal diffusion data in ZrO2 in the same pressure and temperature conditions. The 

FED results are analysed in comparison with literature data. 

1. Introduction 

 

During reactor operation, the fuel cladding inner surface is oxidised. This layer is non 

homogeneous  first  in  thickness,  second  in  composition  (presence  of  hydrides,  amorphous 

precipitates)  and  finally  its  structure  is  strongly  strained  [1].  In  addition,  it  is  contaminated 

with  fission  products  and  actinides  [2].  Actinide  contamination  is  due  to  successive  recoil 

effects induced by fission products and alpha emission. Since the Pressurised Water Reactor 

(PWR)  most  common  fuel  is  UO2,  the  probability  of  contamination  by  uranium  is  largely 

1

 

 

 

 

 

predominant compared to other actinides and, in addition, uranium converts to other actinides, 

mainly Pu and Am by successive (n,γ) reactions and β emission. One important question to 

answer  concerns  the  contribution  of  uranium  diffusion  under  irradiation  in  the  cladding 

contamination.  The  understanding  of the phenomena occurring during reactor operation  and 

their consequences are crucial to model the safety of dry disposals.  

The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  investigate  the  migration  behaviour  of  uranium  in  ZrO2 

under  fission  product  irradiation.  The  present  experiment  was  performed  using  the  high 

neutron flux of the Institut Laue Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble. The diffusion coefficient under 

irradiation  is  compared  to  thermal  data  obtained  in  the  same  pressure  and  temperature 

conditions in order to evaluate the damage role. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. Fission Enhanced diffusion 

A major drawback of this experiment is that it is impossible to collect the sample after 

irradiation, because of the very high radioactivity level. However, it has been shown [3] that 

around 500°C, the stable zirconia structure is monoclinic and that under irradiation, a given 

proportion of tetragonal zirconia is observed. A recent work using 50 MeV Xe irradiation [4] 
shows  that  under  at  480°C  and  5x10-3  Pa  (which  are  the  same  temperature  and  pressure 

conditions  as  those  used  in  this  study),  zirconium  oxidation  is  accelerated  and  the  obtained 

zirconia structure is a mixture of tetragonal phase (50%) and monoclinic phase (50%). This 

composition is stable for xenon fluences close to the FP fluence used in this experiment. 

2.1 Experimental set up 

The ILL is equipped with a high neutron flux nuclear reactor (Φ= 5x1014 n cm-2 s-1) 

and  we  have  used  the  H9  beam  line,  on  which  the  Lohengrin  mass  spectrometer  is  located. 
The  residual  pressure  in  the  beam  tube  is  close  to  5x10-3  Pa.  The  line  is  composed  of  three 

main parts: the target, the Lohengrin spectrometer and an ionisation chamber as detector. The 

target is made of a titanium support covered with a thin platinum deposit on which a 300 µg 
cm-2 uranium oxide layer enriched up to 98% with 235U has been deposited. A 3.1 µm thick x 
3.5  cm2  zirconia  foil  (obtained  from  the  irradiation  enhanced  oxidation  of  a  2  µm  thick 
zirconium  foil)  is  in  contact  with  the  235UO2.  Figure  1  presents  a  scheme  of  the  target 

irradiation  set  up.  This  device  is  positioned  in  the  ILL  thermal  neutron  flux.  The 
corresponding fission fragment (FF) flux generated by the 235UO2 film is estimated to be 1011 

2

particles  cm-2  s-1.  Uranium  diffusion  in  the  zirconia  target  will  occur  under  neutron  and  FF 

irradiation.  These  irradiation  conditions  are  very  close  to  Matzke’s  experiments  [5]  which 

demonstrate that the fission products are the most efficient in the diffusion enhancement. In 

the following, we will use the term Fission Enhanced Diffusion (FED). 

The principle of our experiment is the measurement of the energy distribution evolution of a 
selected  FF  using  the  Lohengrin  spectrometer.  High  energy  FF  are  emitted  from  the  235U 

thermal  fission  and  pass  through  zirconia  before  being  detected.  Their  mass  and  kinetic 

energy are analysed in three successive magnetic and electric fields. At the exit point, all FF 

having  the  same  M/q  ratio  (M  is  the  FF  mass  and  q  is  its  ionic  charge  state)  and  the  same 

velocity are selected. The separated fragments are identified using a high resolution ionisation 

chamber [6]. We have chosen to detect the masses 90 and 136 with the most probable charge 

state (q=18). At regular time intervals, the energy spectra of the chosen fission fragments are 

measured.  The  spectrum  obtained  at  t=0,  representing  the  relative  FF  intensity  versus  its 

kinetic  energy,  is  shown  in  figure  2.  This  spectrum  is  the  result  of  an  energy  scan.  The 

number of events, n, corresponds to the energy, E, and to an acquisition time, t. It is given by 

nN=
tE

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

It allows to express the number of events as function of time and to take into account the fact 

that  the  energetic  acceptance  of  the  spectrometer  is  proportional  to 

1 .  In  addition,  all  the 
E

spectra are normalised to a relative intensity equal to 1 at the spectra maximum. 

The target temperature was measured during irradiation using a specific infra-red pyrometer, 

which  allowed  the  determination  of  the  target  temperature  at  a  distance  of  15  m,  on  a  8x4 
mm2 spot and with an accuracy of 10°C. Such an experiment has been previously described 

[7, 8]. The temperature measurement required the use of two gold mirrors in order to avoid 

the direct view of the pyrometer camera towards the high neutron flux. Figure 3 displays the 

general  set  up.  In  our  experiment,  temperature  was  measured  twice  a  day;  it  remained 

constant at a mean value of 480°C. 

2.2 Results 

Figure 4 displays the evolution of the FF kinetic energy distribution for three diffusion 

times  (t=0,  t=380  h,  t=546  h)  and  at  480°C.  Each  distribution  is  fitted  with  gaussian-like 

N :

curves.  We  observe  that  the  kinetic  energy  distributions  broaden  while  the  mean  kinetic 

energy value remains constant (50 MeV for M=90 and 20 MeV for M=136). Only the right 

part  of  the  distribution,  which  is  correlated  to  uranium  diffusion  in  zirconia,  is  considered 

since  the  low  energy  part  corresponds  to  diffusion  in  the  platinum  deposit  of  the  target 

support. 

2.3 Modelling of the diffusion process under irradiation 

In order to deduce an apparent diffusion coefficient of uranium in zirconia, we have 

simulated  the  evolution  of  the  energy  spectra  as  a  function  of  time.  In  this  model,  uranium 

diffusion follows the Fick’s second law according to: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(2) 

C
∂  = - D* 
t
∂

2

C
∂
x
∂
2

 

where C is the atomic concentration of the diffusing uranium, D* is the diffusion coefficient 
under irradiation (cm2 s-1) and x the diffusion depth (cm). The solutions depend on boundary 

conditions which are the following: 

for  

x > 0, C = C(x,t), 

x = ∝, C(∝,t) =0, 

t = 0, C(x,0) =0. 

x ≤ 0, C= CS =1/3. The number of diffusing uranium atoms is negligible compared to 

the total amount of uranium in the deposit. So, in first approximation, CS is constant 

and equal to the atomic uranium concentration in UO2. 

These boundary conditions imply a uranium diffusion study within concentration gradients. 

They lead to the following  analytical solution : 

  

 

 

 

 

C(x, t) = CS erfc

where t is the irradiation time (s). 

Figure  5  gives  a  schematic  representation  of  our  approach  which  is  based  on  the  following 

conditions : before diffusion, the thin UO2 layer (constant uranium concentration) corresponds 

to  a  gaussian  energy  distribution  of  FF  (fig.  5a).  As  uranium  diffuses,  the  FF  distribution 
broadens  (fig.  5b).  For  a  given  irradiation  time  t,  a  D*  value  is  supposed  from  which, 

according  to  equation  (3),  one  can  calculate  an  uranium  diffusion  profile.  This  calculated 

profile is discretised in elementary depths dx in which the uranium concentration is supposed 

4

 

 

 

 

 

 

to  be  constant.  Each  elementary  part  is  associated  to  a  Gaussian-like  distribution  with  the 

same half-width but with a maximum energy deduced from the energy loss calculations (fig. 

5c).  At  a  given  time  t,  the  FF  energy  profile  is  rebuilt  by  summing  the  effects  of  all 
elementary contributions. The correct value of D* is obtained by fitting the result of the model 

to the experimental spectrum. An illustration of such a simulation is presented in figure 6 for 

the mass 90. We observe that uranium diffuses up to 1.6 µm in depth after an irradiation time 

of  546  hours.  We  have  estimated  with  the  SRIM  code  [9]  the  amount  of  uranium  atoms 

recoiling  by  FF  elastic  diffusion.  The  calculation  result  shows  that  beyond  0.2  µm,  the 

recoiling uranium yield is negligible. 

Finally,  the  apparent  uranium  diffusion  coefficient  in  ZrO2  under  irradiation  deduced  from 
this model at 480°C and for a flux of 1011 FF cm-2 s-1 has been determined to be equal to (1.0 

± 0.1)x10-15cm2 s-1. The error bar is determined from the diffusion model fit. 

3. Thermal diffusion 

To  compare  the  results  under  irradiation  with  thermal  data,  a  diffusion  study  was 

performed  by  coupling  ion  implantation  and  Rutherford  Backscattering  Spectrometry. 

Zirconium  oxide  was  obtained  by  annealing  polycrystalline  zirconium  foils  in  air  at  450°C 

during 5 hours. In these conditions, the zirconia layer in the Zr  substrate  reaches  1.5  µm  in 

thickness. These samples were then implanted at the Nuclear Physics Institute of Lyon with 
238U2+  ions  of  800  keV  energy  and  with  a  fluence  of  1016  ions  cm-2  s-1.  The  uranium  range 

calculated  with  SRIM  is  100  nm  and  the  maximum  U  concentration  is  about  1  at.%,  in 

agreement with RBS analysis. Complementary grazing angle X-ray diffraction analysis shows 

an increase of the tetragonal phase up to 36 % induced by implantation [8] in agreement with 
literature data [10, 11]. Annealings were performed at 800°C under primary vacuum (7.5x10-1 

Pa).  The  study  could  not  be  performed  in  a  secondary  vacuum  because  of  the  zirconia 

dissolution in such conditions [12].  

RBS  spectra  registered  with  3  MeV  alpha  particles  do  not  show  any  broadening  of  the  U 

distributions  after  a  23  h  annealing  at  800°C  as  shown  in  figure  7.  This  means  that  in  our 

experimental  conditions,  no  uranium  diffusion  can  be  detected.  Therefore,  the  thermal 
diffusion coefficient Dth is lower than 10-18 cm2 s-1.

4. Discussion 

 

We  have  shown  that  thermal  diffusion  of  uranium  in  ZrO2  is  extremely  low  (<10-18 
cm2  s-1  at  800°C).  These  results  are  in  agreement  with  data  concerning  cation  transport  in 

zirconia, and which are collected in the review paper of Kilo et al. [13]. Under FF irradiation, 
the diffusion coefficient strongly increases; it reaches 10-15 cm2 s-1 under a FF flux F of 1011 
particles cm-2 s-1 at a temperature of 480°C. Therefore irradiation defects are predominant on 

the diffusion mechanism. 

As known from the theory of the diffusion under irradiation [14, 15], irradiation increases the 

point defect concentration in the material, and this increase influences diffusion in the solid. 
D* can be written as :  

  

 

 

 

 

D* = Dirr + Dth 

 

 

 

 

(4) 

with  Dirr  and  Dth  respectively  the  diffusion  under  irradiation  and  the  thermal  diffusion 

contributions [14]. From results obtained in parts 2.3 and 3, it appears that Dth is negligible in 
regards  to  Dirr,  and  so  D*  is  very  close  to  Dirr.  Therefore,  we  consider  that  the  diffusion  of 

uranium  in  ZrO2  is  not  thermally  activated  and  depends  on  the  FF  flux  only  [16].  We  can 

estimate the uranium diffusion coefficient Dirr in ZrO2, generated by irradiation induced  FF 

ballistic effects. As usually considered [17]: 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(5) 

Dirr = 

1
6

2RΓ

  

where R is the root-mean square displacement of a uranium atom in the collision cascade and 

Γ is the jump rate proportional to the atomic displacement rate F in dpa s-1 (Γ = α F, where α 

corresponds to the number of atomic jumps per displacement). 

In order to determine F, it is necessary to estimate the number of defects created at ILL. Only 

defects  induced  by  FF  will  be  taken  into  account  in  this  evaluation.  The  mass  and  kinetic 

energy distributions of fission products are well known and it is usual to consider that the ion 

with  mass  117  at  0.7  MeV/u  is  representative  of  fission  products.  Hence,  in  SRIM 
calculations, we have considered the  117In isotope with a kinetic energy equal to 82.5 MeV. 

Moreover,  the  FF  emission  is  isotropic  and  the  range  of  the  FF  in  the  foil  depends  on  the 

emission  angle  θ.  We  have  calculated  the  number  of  dpa  created  as  a  function  of  depth  for 

emission  angles  varying  from  0°  to  88°.  An  average  distribution  is  deduced  from  those 

contributions. It corresponds to a mean F value equal to 6.4x10-5 dpa s-1. 

 

6

In  order  to  evaluate  R,  we  have  been  done  a  SRIM  full  cascade  calculation  and  we  have 

obtained that the mean recoil energy value of uranium in ZrO2 corresponds to R equal to 15 

nm. 

The D* experimental values were reproduced by using equation (5) in which α is equal to 40. 

This high value puts in evidence that atomic displacements only, cannot explain the radiation 

enhanced diffusion. It is comparable to the results of Müller [17] who introduced an α value 

of 125 and concluded to a significant influence of radiation induced sinks (dislocations, grain 

boundaries, vacancy and interstitial clusters,…) generated along the heavy ion trajectory.  

We have compared our results with those of Matzke, who measured uranium and plutonium 

diffusion in UO2 in reactor irradiations [5, 16, 18]. His experimental conditions are close to 
ours,  since  he  follows  the  behaviour  of  thin  233UO2  or  238PuO2  tracer  layers  deposited  on  1 

mm thick UO2 single crystals. To interpret his results, Matzke has considered that the whole 

damage,  including  displacement  cascades  as  well  as  changes  in  the  material  physical 

properties,  is  produced  along  the  fission  product  trajectory.  He  has  shown  that  for 

temperatures  lower  than  1000°C,  the  D*  coefficient  of  U  and  Pu  in  UO2  is  not  thermally 

activated  and  is  proportional  to  the  fission  rate.  He  normalised  these  data  to  a  rate  value  of 
5x1012 fissions cm-3 s-1, and the corresponding D* value of U and Pu in UO2 is around 7x10-
17cm2 s-1 [16].  

In  order  to  go  further  in  the  comparison,  we  have  estimated  the  fission  product  flux  Φ 
reaching the 233UO2 surface layer in Matzke’s experiment using the Hocking expression [19]. 

  

 

 

 

 

Φ = 2 f d 

 

 

 

 

 

(6) 

where, f is the fission rate, d (8 µm)  is the mean fission product range in UO2 and the factor 
of 2 arises from allowing for two fission fragments per fission. We found a value of 8x109 FF 
cm-2  s-1.  In  our  experiment,  D*  of  U  in  ZrO2  equal  to  10-15  cm2  s-1  is  induced  by  a  FF  flux 
equal to 1011 FF cm-2 s-1. Assuming that the FED D* of U in ZrO2 is proportional to the FF 
flux, then, our D* value normalised to Matzke’s conditions is equal to 8x10-17 cm2 s-1. These 

data  are  summarised  in  table  1.  The  similar  behaviour  of  these  2  insulators  UO2  and  ZrO2 

towards uranium FED can be explained by similar processes of defect evolution induced by 

bombardment with heavy ions [20].

5. Conclusion 

 
We  have  shown  that  under  FF  irradiation,  uranium  diffused  in  zirconia,  with  a 
diffusion coefficient at 480°C equal to 10-15 cm2 s-1. To compare this result with uranium FED 

data  in  UO2,  we  have  considered  that  the  damage  on  the  whole  FF  range  influences  the 

surface diffusion. In such conditions, the diffusion coefficients are in good agreement, which 

put in evidence that under FF irradiation, U has the same behaviour in UO2 and ZrO2. This is 

corroborated  by  the  large  and  similar  value  of  the  experimental  D*  and  the  theoretical  Dirr 

coefficients.  This  last  coefficient  is  weakly  dependent  on  atomic  displacements  in  the 

collision  cascade  but  is  largely  influenced  by  radiation  induced  sinks  which  enhance  the 

uranium mobility.

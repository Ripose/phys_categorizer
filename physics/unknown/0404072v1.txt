Abstract

Methodology for calculating the profile and emittance of a particle beam

as it is slowed down in matter, including the effects of multiple

scattering, axial magnetic field and lithium lens.  Strategies are

determined for minimum final emittance.  For ionization cooling, boron

carbide is superior to liquid hydrogen while a beryllium lens has merit.

1  Introduction

2

When a beam passes through matter its profile changes due to two

effects; the effect of drift distance following the usual rules for a

beam in vacuum, and the effects of multiple scattering.  Assuming that

the scattering distribution is Gaussian we derive an equation for the

combined effects and show how to minimize the output emittance.

Refocusing by an axial magnetic field or lithium lens is included.

Sections 2 - 8 are based on an unpublished report by C. Carli and the

present author[1].

In particle therapy with protons or light ions coming from a fixed

energy accelerator, it is necessary to adjust the range by passing the

particles through a slab of matter, known as the degrader.  One should

use the best strategy to minimize the loss of beam by transverse

scattering.

The results can also be used to optimise the "ionization cooling" of

muon beams, with or without a magnetic field.  We derive equations for

cooling in an axial field and in a lithium or beryllium lens.  The best

degrader is boron carbide; liquid hydrogen may be less useful.

2  Recapitulation of linear beam transport formalism

The trajectories of particles in a beam may be defined by the

lateral distance x and the direction θ in a transverse plane relative to

a reference orbit.  If the deviations are small linear differential

equations apply and the motion may be treated by a matrix formalism[2-

5].  In the absence of coupling between the horizontal and vertical

planes and if the influence of momentum spread is small the equation

reduces to

a drift space of length  t  in the absence of magnetic fields the

transport matrix is

R =



The beam profile is assumed to be defined[3] by an ellipse which

traces the contour in phase space at one standard deviation from the

reference particle, the equation of the ellipse being given by the

symmetric Sigma matrix

When written out this implies

σ22 x2 − 2 σ12 x θ + σ11 θ2 = Δ = σ11 σ22 − σ12

(4)

For an upright ellipse σ12 = 0 and the standard deviations in position

and angle are σx= √σ11 and σθ = √σ22.  Δ is the determinant of the sigma

matrix and the area of the ellipse in phase space is π√Δ.  It will be

convenient to omit the factor π and refer to ε = σx. σθ = √Δ as the

emittance of the beam.

The sigma matrix defining the phase space ellipse is

transported[3] according to

Applying this formula to a drift space t one obtains

For a given x its distribution in θ is centred at

θ0 = xσ12/σ11 and the variance σ22-σ12

2/σ11 is independent of x.

13 April 2004

If one integrates the first Gaussian over all θ the result will be an

area which is independent of x.  Then the distribution in x will be

given by the second Gaussian with variance σ11.

By rearranging (8) in a different way one can show that at a fixed θ the

variance of x is σ11-σ12

2/σ22, and integrating over all x the variance of θ

is σ22.

4  Effect of scattering in the degrader

If a charged particle of atomic number Z with velocity v/c = β and

momentum p (in MeV/c), traverses a thin slab of matter of thickness dt

and radiation length X0, it suffers many small angle elastic

scatterings.  This results[6] in a distribution in angle which is

approximately Gaussian with variance Vθ = Kdt/(pβ)2 where K = 200Z2/X0.

For a thin slab the scattering cannot change x nor the centre of the

distribution in θ.  Therefore σ11 and σ12 are unaffected.  The variance in

θ is increased by the amount Vθ, so

Combining with (7) the overall change in the sigma matrix for a thin

€ 

slab is

(10)

To solve for a thick slab one can integrate term by term, starting with

€ 

σ22.  Let t = 0 at the beginning of the degrader and designate the σ-

components of the initial beam with the additional index 0.  Then the

solution for the component σ22 is

In the integral one must insert the correct variation of pβ with

is the matrix for the beam at the end of the degrader allowing for the

€ 

drift space but with no scattering.  The second matrix in (14), called

the degrader matrix, contains all the scattering action and is

independent of the input beam geometry!

5 Convolution theorem

Equation (14) is an example of a more general theorem.  One can

show that in all cases the convolution of two elliptical Gaussian

distributions represented by matrices σ1 and σ2 is an elliptical

Gaussian distribution represented by the matrix σ = σ1 + σ2.

A narrow pencil beam of zero emittance passing through the degrader will

come out with matrix 

σdegrad =

 
A
 
B
 

B

C

 
 .  This applies to any small subset
 

of the general beam σbeam, so the overall output is obtained by

convoluting σbeam with σdegrader which gives (14).  This will apply also in

€ 

the presence of an axial magnetic field or lithium lens, which we will

discuss below.

6  Minimization of output emittance

For a given degrader, the smallest output emittance is obtained by

adjusting the input beam to make the determinant of the final sigma

matrix σout

 in (14) as small as possible.  We have

det σout = εbeam

2

+ ( AC − B2 ) + (Cσ11

beam + Aσ22

beam − 2 B σ12

beam )

(16)

In this formula the first term, the emittance of the input beam, and the

second term, depending only on the degrader, are invariable: but the

final term depends on the chosen shape of the input beam.  It will be a

8

minimum if

C dσ11

beam + A dσ22

beam

− 2 Bdσ12

beam = 0

(17)

while the fixed emittance of the input beam implies

beam dσ11

beam + σ11

beamdσ22

beam − 2 σ12

beam dσ12

σ22

beam = 0

(18)

Eliminating dσ12 between these two equations we find that they are

satisfied if σ11/σ12 = A/B and σ22/σ12= C/B, implying that the four

elements of the beam matrix σbeam must be proportional to the

corresponding elements of the degrader matrix, so the optimum input beam

is given by

beam

σopt

=

εin
AC − B2

 
A
 
B
 

B

C

 
 
 

(19)

This is the matrix for the input beam at the end of the degrader (in the

€ 

absence of scattering).  Transposing through distance -d to make an

upright ellipse using (6), one finds that the beam should be focused at

an image point distant B/C before the end of the degrader; (for thin

degraders this corresponds to the centre of the slab).

Inserting (19) into (14) one finds that the output beam apparently

diverges from the same image point and has the same shape. The emittance

of the output beam comes to

min = εbeam
εout

+

AC − B2

 

(20)

13 April 2004

9

This is our main result.  With the optimum input beam, the emittance is

increased by a constant amount, εdeg rad = AC − B2

 characteristic of the

degrader.

The shape required for the input beam is determined by the matrix of the

degrader.  The corresponding standard deviation in angle is σθ = √C and

the standard deviation in lateral position is σx = εdegrad /σθ.  The

corresponding quantities for the input beam at the image point should be

in the same proportion.

7  Numerical Evaluation

For a thin degrader of thickness t, K'= K/(pβ)2 is almost

constant, so C = K't, B = K't2/2 and A = K't3/3.  The distance from the

image point to the end of the degrader is B/C = t/2 and the emittance is

εdegrad = K't2/√12

(21)

For a fixed decrement in momentum εdegrad is inversely proportional to W2X0

where W = -dp/dx, so the best material will be the one with the largest

value of this product.

The ratio of image size to convergence angle, is

β⊥ = σx/σθ = εdegrad /C = t/√12  

(22)

For a thick degrader, when pβ  varies significantly with range, one must

calculate the integrals A, B and C using the range energy tables.

8  Results

As an example the degrader emittance εdegrad has been calculated for

protons slowing down from 250 MeV to 115 MeV in various materials, (the

13 April 2004

10

corresponding ranges in water are 38 cm and 10 cm), with the results

given in Table 1.

One sees that boron carbide is better than beryllium or graphite,

because it combines high density with reasonably low atomic number.  The

best material of all is diamond, but it is not usually available in the

appropriate sizes.  The relative performance of different degraders is

the same for any energy loss and any particle.

9 Axial magnetic field

In the presence of a magnetic field parallel to the beam the

particles will spiral around the lines of force and the transverse

spread will be reduced.  How much can this improve the performance of

the degrader?  Solutions to this problem have been given by Farley,

Fiorentini and Stocks[7] and Pearce[8].  Here we derive the sigma matrix

for a degrader in the axial magnetic field so that the optimum input

beam can be specified.

Following references [2] and [3], for particles of momentum p travelling

distance t and in axial field B, the transverse components of momentum

rotate about the field through angle 2kt with 2k = eB/βγm0c2.  (k is half

the wave number at which the particles spiral around the lines of

force).

In a frame of reference rotating with angle kt, the x- and y-motions are

decoupled to first order and the transport matrix is

The magnetic field does not change the angle of a track to the axis, so

one would expect σ2

θ to increase uniformly with t.  This is not the case

in the rotating coordinate system.  To transform to the non-rotating

frame one must add the component k2σ2

in agreement with the results of Farley, Fiorentini and Stocks[7] and of

Pearce[8] obtained with two quite different methods.

This gives some confidence in (28) which is the degrader matrix in a

magnetic field.  We see that it becomes an upright ellipse whenever

2kt = 2nπ, that is at every complete turn in the field.  These are

convenient points at which to match the input beam.

Because of the convolution theorem (section 5 above), the

procedure for minimizing the emittance of the final beam is the same as

before (section 6); the beam shape, calculated at the end of degrader

with no scattering, should match the degrader matrix.  Then for constant

K' the emittance will be increased by

εdeg rad

=

(

′ K t / 2k

) 1 − sin2 kt(

)/(kt)2

(30)

with the second term under the square root becoming negligible after one

turn.

13 April 2004

13

At every whole spiral turn in the field this simplifies to

εdegrad = K't2/(2kt) = K't2/2nπ for n spiral turns, compared with

εdegrad = K't2/√12 in zero field.  The improvement is a factor 1.814 × n.

One sees from Table 1 that in zero field liquid hydrogen is a factor 5.1

worse than boron carbide; it would need at least 3 turns in the field to

make it competitive.  This result is valid for thin degraders with any

particle and any energy loss.

The sigma matrix for the incoming beam, passing through the magnetic

field without scattering, is obtained using (5) with (23).  To simplify,

assume that the initial ellipse is upright with σ12 = 0.  Then

At every whole turn in the field (kt = nπ) the ellipse again becomes

upright and one can match to the upright degrader ellipse (28) by

adjusting the input values of σ11 and σ22.

From (28) the beta value should be β⊥ = σx/σθ = 1/k = λ/π

where λ is the spiral wavelength in the solenoid.

10 Lithium lens

If the beam is travellling along a rod of radius a carrying a

current uniformly spread thorugh its cross section, the magnetic field

B  inside the rod is proportional to the distance  x  from  the axis, B

= B0x/a, where B0 is the field at the surface of the rod.  The field is

everywhere perpendicular to the track of the particle and the bending in

distance  dt is

(32)

(33)

(In this case the wave number at which the particles oscillate in the

focusing system is k).

The transport matrix is (23) with the new value of k

and applying (5) one finds again equation (24). Therefore the

differential equations (25) apply, the solution is again (28) and the

conclusions of Section 9 apply.

The diffusion of particles in a lithium lens was treated by Fernow and

Gallardo[11] by a different method; their distribution ellipse is

specified by the parameters F, G and H given in their equation (12)

which are identical to our A, C and B in (28) above with the ansatz ω =

k, and θc

2 = K'.

From Table 1 we see that in zero field lithium is 3.03 times worse than

boron carbide.  With the new definition of k, for n complete

oscillations in the field the improvement factor is 3.628 × n  so after

one or more oscillations a lithium lens degrader will be better than

boron carbide in zero field.

11 Ionization cooling

Ionization cooling is proposed for reducing the emittance of muon

beams before acceleration[10, 11].  If one reduces the forward momentum

p by the amount δp in an energy degrader of thickness t with no

scattering the transverse momenta would be reduced in the same

13 April 2004

15

proportion; then when one restores the longitudinal momentum by

acceleration the original emittance ε would be reduced by

δεa = εδp / p = − ε W t / p

(34)

However the scattering in the degrader will in the optimum case increase

the emittance by (21).  This exceeds (34) if the degrader thickness t is

where W = -dp/dx.

greater than tm given by

tm =

12
′ K 

εW
p

 

If we are to have useful cooling t must be less than tm.  Putting

η = t/tm one finds that the net cooling is

which is a maximum when η = 0.5.  The maximum cooling for a single

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

Equation (37) shows that the fractional reduction in emittance is

independent of beam momentum.  It is proportional to ε and so becomes

13 April 2004

16

smaller and smaller as the beam is cooled.  Getting below 50 mm.mR looks

difficult, see Table 2.

To get efficient cooling it would be good to work at low energy where

W = dp/dx is large.  However this is not possible because the spread in

energy will increase too much[9, 10].  This factor forces us to work at

or above minimum ionization at βγ = 3.  As an example, for 0.315 GeV/c

muons the optimum cooling in a single stage and the corresponding energy

loss ΔE are given in Table 2 for two degrader materials, boron carbide

and liguid hydrogen, with various initial emittances.

With initial emittance ε = 1000 mm.mR, for example, five degraders of

liquid hydrogen, total length 320 cm, interleaved with focusing systems

would reduce the emittance by 14.6% with an energy loss, to be replaced

by acceleration, of 91.5 MeV.  In contrast one layer of boron carbide

22 cm long with an energy loss of 94 MeV would reduce the emittance by

15.6%.

If one prefers smaller steps, one can divide the boron carbide into five

separate degraders each 4.4 cm long with refocusing and reacceleration

between each.  Then, applying eqn (36) five times, with η = 0.1, the

total decrease in emittance would be about 28% for the same energy loss.

Clearly boron carbide is far superior to liquid hydrogen and provides

cooling without refrigeration!

Liquid hydrogen, because of its low value of W2X0 (see Table 1) does not

appear attractive.  We saw in section 9 that an axial magnetic field can

improve the performance, but it needs three or more spiral turns of the

beam inside the hydrogen to be competitive.  This implies a field of

order 30 T.

13 April 2004

17

If the degrader is a lithium lens (Section 10) then one complete

oscillation of the beam inside the lithium is sufficient to make it

marginally better than boron carbide.

All this presupposes that in each case the beam is focused onto the

degrader in the optimum way to achieve minimum increase in emittance as

specified in sections 6 and 9 above.  The need to use a high density

degrader and focus to a small spot was already emphasized by

Neuffer[11].

12 Equilibrium emittance in an axial field

If the beam makes several turns in a solenoid field B, equation

(30) shows that δεdegrad increases as t rather than t2,  so in this case

there is no optimum thickness.  Comparing (30) with (34) and using the

definition of K' there will be cooling if

ε > εequilib =

200
2 k p β2 W X 0

(39)

This determines the equilibrium emittance below which no cooling will

€ 

occur.

In a field of 1 T the muon angular cyclotron frequency (eB/m0c) is 8.506

× 108 s-1 so, using the definition of k (section 9),

εequilib =

200 c
β2 W X0 eB / m0c
(

) m0c

=

66.8
β2 W X0 B(Tesla)

(40)

For β ~ 1 this is independent of the muon momentum.

In liquid hydrogen in a typical field of 7 T, εequilib comes to 386 mm.mR .

The focusing wavelength comes to

For example, with γ = 3 in a field of 7 T, λ = 94 cm and we have seen

above that in hydrogen one needs 3 turns in the field to be competitive.

This means that each section should be at least 2.8 m long, implying an

energy loss of 80 MeV.  For smaller steps in energy, boron carbide

without field is superior.

However, of the substances in Table 1, liquid hydrogen has the highest

value of WX0 and therefore the smallest equilibrium emittance in a given

axial field.

For example a lithium rod of radius a = 2 cm, carrying a current of 500

kA would have a surface field B0 = 5 T.  In this case εequilib = 152 mm.mR

and the wavelength of oscillations is 41 cm.  The energy loss in this

length would be 36 MeV.  For smaller steps in energy boron carbide in

zero field would be better.

Beryllium with no field is 2.6 times better than lithium (see Table 1)

and has better mechanical properties, so it might be considered for a

lens.  For the same diameter and current as above, εequilib is slightly

worse at 200 mm.mR, the focusing wavelength is the same (41 cm), but the

energy loss in this distance is 120 MeV, so the cooling effect is much

greater.  For shorter lengths the lens action becomes progressively less

significant.

14. Summary

equation (22).

For proton therapy with a fixed energy accelerator the best

degraders are boron carbide, beryllium and graphite.  To minimize the

final emittance it is essential to match the beam to the degrader using

For ionization cooling the beam must again be matched to the degrader.

Liquid hydrogen is unlikely to be competitive even in a strong axial

field.  A lithium lens (or beryllium lens) is more promising, but none

of these can cool below εequilib  given by equations (40) and (42),

typically in the range 150 – 400 mm.mR.  In contrast there is no

theoretical limit to the cooling by a low Z, dense degrader such as

boron carbide; it just becomes very slow below 50 mm.mR so the muon

lifetime will be the critical factor.

εdegrad is the emittance added to the beam with optimum focusing.  The

smallest degrader emittance εdegrad is the best.

The penultimate column gives the value of W2X0 for each material, the

largest value giving the best result. The values of W X0 (final column)

are used in sections 12 and 13.

ABSTRACT 

We present a simple thought experiment in which a beam of light of a finite length enters 

a  detection  device  that  consists  of  a  wave  detector  and  a  light  bulb.  We  examine  the 

experiment  from  the  reference  frame  where  the  device  is  stationary  and  from  the 

reference frame where it moves at a constant velocity. We use the principles of special 

relativity to derive the formulas that show how the length and the wavelength of the light 

beam are transformed between the reference frames. We further show that the uncommon 

formula for length transformation of a light beam does not contradict the usual relativistic 

result that a uniformly moving object will be Lorentz contracted along the direction of its 

motion. We use the results to point out a mistake made in recent paper [J. E. Avron, E. 

Berg,  D.  Goldsmith  and  A.  Gordon,  “Is  the  number  of  photons  a  classical  invariant?,” 

Eur.  J.  Phys.  20,  153-159  (1999)],  in  which  the  authors  have  incorrectly  introduced  a 

paradox  that  the  number  of  photons  seems  to  depend  on  the  reference  frame  where  the 

counting was made. The method of derivation in the present paper belongs to the scope 

of an introductory course in special relativity. We hope that it will provoke and improve 

student’s  interest  in  special  relativity  and  his  or  her  understanding  of  the  fundamental 

concepts of the theory.

The  ingenuity  of  the  modern  physics  teacher  lies  in  his  ability  to  teach  about 

familiar things in an unfamiliar way. The goal will be further achieved if by employing a 

novel  approach  the  teacher  succeeded  to  bring  the  lecture  at  a  level  appropriate  for  the 

audience  he  intended  to  motivate.  Also,  the use of  minimum calculations would  enable 

the  student  to  think  more  about  the  physics  of  the  problem  instead  of  wondering  about 

mathematics.  

When  it  comes  to  teaching  special  relativity  to  an  undergraduate  classroom,  the 

task  is  even  more  challenging  because  the  theory  is  hard  to  comprehend  even  in  its 

simplest  form.  A  very  effective  method  to  motivate and strengthen student’s interest  in 

special  relativity  is  to  introduce  the  subject  in  an  old-fashioned  way,  that  is,  by  using 

thought experiments [1]. This paper uses the latter method to derive some common and 

uncommon results in relativistic optics. 

 

Consider  a  chopped  beam  of  light  of  length  l0  incident  on  a  stationary  wave 
detector  D  (see  Fig.  1).  The  detector  D  is  connected  to  a  switching  mechanism  that 

controls  a  light  bulb  in  such  a  way  that  when  the  detector  D  is  disturbed  by  an 

electromagnetic energy, the bulb will glow. Otherwise, the bulb is switched off. The time 

required for the whole light beam to pass through the point of location of the detector D

which is the time for which the detector D will be disturbed by the light beam, and, thus, 

the time for which the light bulb will be switched on. Here, c refers to the speed of the 

light beam, and equals the speed of light in vacuum. 

Let us explore the experiment in Fig. 1 from a reference frame traveling to the left 

at  a  constant  velocity  v.  Now,  the  detection  device  will  move  to  the  right  at  a  constant 

velocity  v  (see  Fig.  2).  Let  ∆t  be  the  time  interval  required  for  the  light  beam  to  pass 

through  the  moving  detector  D.  This  is  the  time  for  which  the  moving  light  bulb  will 

glow.  For  this  same  amount  of  time  ∆t,  the  detector  D  will  move  a  distance  v∆t  to  the 

right, and the light beam will traverse the distance c∆t in the same direction. The relation

becomes obvious from Fig. 2. Here l denotes the length of the light beam with respect to  

the reference frame where the detection device is moving at a constant velocity v to the 

right.  While  writing  Eq.  (2),  we  have  taken  into  account  the  constant  light  speed 

postulate, according to which the light beam will preserve its velocity c in both reference 

frames [2]. 

The time intervals ∆t0 and ∆t are related by the time dilation formula

Elimination of ∆t0 and ∆t from Eqs. (1), (2) and (3) yields

The result states that if a beam of light of a finite length l0 with respect to the reference 
frame  S0,  is  observed  from  a  reference  frame  S  that  travels  relative  to  S0  at  a  constant 
velocity v in the direction which is opposite to the direction of motion of the light beam, 

then the observer in S will conclude that the length of the light beam will be contracted 
with respect to the length of the light beam in S0 in accordance with Eq. (4). The result 
seems to contradict the standard Lorentz contraction formula, but we will show that this 

is not so. Also, one may notice that the term “proper length” makes no sense in the case 
of  a  light  beam  due  to  the  fact  that  the  speed  of  the  light  beam  in  both  S0  and  S  will 
remain unchanged and equal to c. 

If  the  light  beam  in  Fig.  1  was  plane-polarized  and  was  chopped  exactly  at  the 

locations  of  two  wave  crests,  and  if  the  light  beam  contains  N  wave  crests  along  its 

length, then

where λ0  is  the  wavelength  of  the  light.  The  number of the wave crests is  a result  of a 
simple counting procedure, and, therefore, it must remain invariant with respect to every 

inertial reference frame [3]. Hence, if the light beam is observed from the reference frame 

where the setup is moving at a constant velocity v to the right, we will have

where λ  refers  to  the  wavelength  of  the  light  in  this  case.  From  Eqs.  (5)  and  (6),  and 

taking into account Eq. (4), we obtain  

which  is  the  well-known  relativistic  Doppler  formula  [4].  If  we  repeat  the  same 

derivation in the case when the setup in Fig. 1 is moving to the left at the same constant 

speed  v,  we  will  arrive  at  the  conclusion  that  the  length  of  the  light  beam  will  be 

elongated in accordance with the formula

and, consequently, that the wavelength of the light will transform as 

Thus,  there  will  exist  an  asymmetry  between  the  observations  of  the  length  and  the 

wavelength of the light beam made by the observer that moves to the left at a constant 

speed v and the observer that moves to the right at the same constant speed v. 

The result that the length of a light beam transforms in a way described by Eqs. 

(4) and (8) does not contradict the usual relativistic result that a uniformly moving object  

will  be  Lorentz  contracted  along  the  direction  of  its  motion.  In  order  to  show  that  this 

assertion is correct, let us explore the setup given in Fig. 3. We have a stationary rod of 
length L0 that has two detection devices placed at both of its ends. The detection device 
placed at the left end of the rod is slightly modified. It operates in an opposite way to the 

one at its right end which is the usual detecting device we have been using previously. 
That is, the light bulb at the left end will be switched off in the case when the detector D1 
is disturbed by an electromagnetic energy, and will be glowing otherwise. Now, consider

the light beam of equal length L0 incident on the detecting devices from the left (see Fig. 
3). Before the light beam hits the detector D1 at the left end of the rod, the left bulb will 
glow, and the right bulb will be switched off (Fig. 3a). During the time of passage of the 

light beam through the first detector, both light bulbs will be switched off (Fig. 3b). At 
the instant when the light beam will hit the detector D2 on the right, the light beam will 
leave the first detector, and both light bulbs will be instantaneously switched on (Fig. 3c).  

 

We will now explore the situation in Fig. 3c with respect to the reference frame 

where the rod is moving at a constant velocity v to the right (see Fig. 4). A careful reader 

may  notice  that  the  situation  is  equivalent  to  the  one  in  the  famous  Einstein’s  train-

embankment  thought  experiment  [5]  in  which  the  opposite  ends  of  the  train  are  hit  by 

strokes of lightning. If we make a modification in Einstein’s experiment by substituting 

the train with the rod, and the strokes with the detecting devices, we may conclude that 

the light bulbs in Fig. 4 will not glow instantaneously, but with a certain time delay ∆τ. 

That is, the light bulb at the right end of the moving rod will be switched on a time

later than the light bulb at the left [6]. Here, L denotes the length of the moving rod. The 

time interval ∆τ is the time that elapsed between the instant when the light beam leaves 

the left detector (Fig. 4a) and the instant when the light beam hits the right detector (Fig. 

4b). During this time interval ∆τ, the rod has moved the distance v∆τ to the right, and the 

light beam has traversed the distance c∆τ in the same direction. Hence, from Fig. 4, we

where d is the length of the light beam. The length d of the light beam in the reference 

frame where the rod is moving at a constant velocity v to the right is related to the length 
L0 of the light beam in the reference frame where the rod is stationary through Eq. (4).

which states that the moving rod will be Lorentz-contracted along its velocity vector.  

Let us repeat the derivation associated with Fig. 3c with respect to the reference 

frame where the rod is moving at a constant velocity v to the left (see Fig 5). Again, by 

making an analogy with Einstein’s experiment, we may conclude that the light bulb at the 

left end of the moving rod will be switched on a time

the light beam hits the right detector (Fig. 5a) and the instant when the light beam leaves 

the left detector (Fig. 5b). During this time interval ∆τ′, the rod has moved the distance 

v∆τ′ to the left, and the light beam has traversed the distance c∆τ′ to the right. From Fig.

which is identical to Eq. (13). The result shows that the formula for length transformation 

of  a  light  beam  is  compatible  to  the  usual  contraction  formula  for  a  uniformly  moving 

object. 

A typical example of an improper usage of length transformation formulas is the 

recent discussion by Avron et al. [7] considering the problem of Lorentz invariance of the 

number  of  photons  in  a  fictitious  rectangular  box  that  encloses  a  portion  of  a  plane-

polarized  electromagnetic  wave  traveling  along  the  positive  x  axis  of  the  S  reference 

frame. The box was considered to be stationary with respect to the reference frame S, and 

aligned  parallel  to  its  x  axis.  The  authors  have  used  the  results  from  classical 

electrodynamics and the photon theory of light, and the assumption that the rectangular 

box obeys the usual Lorentz contraction formula if observed from the reference frame S′ 

that travels along the positive x axis at a constant velocity v, to encounter a paradox that 

the  number  of  photons  enclosed  in  the  box  is  not  Lorentz  invariant.  The  authors  have 

incorrectly assumed that the box will be stationary in S, and will be moving at a constant 

velocity v in S′, and thus have obviously made a mistake by considering the volume of 

the rectangular box as a volume of a physical object that encloses the wave. If they have 

correctly considered the volume of the box as the volume of the portion of the wave (and, 

thus,  that  the  box  is  moving  at  velocity  c  in  both  reference  frames),  and  have  used  the 

formula  for  length  transformation  in  Eq.  (8)  instead  of  the  usual  Lorentz  contraction 

formula, they would have arrived at the correct conclusion that the number of photons is 

indeed Lorentz invariant [8].

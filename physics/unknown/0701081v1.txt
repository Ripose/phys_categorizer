Abstract.  This  paper  is  on  the  spatio-temporal  signals  with  the  topologically  modulated 
electromagnetic  fields.  The  carrier  of  the  digital  information  is  the  topological  scheme  composed  of 
the separatrices-manifolds and equilibrium positions of the field. The signals and developed hardware 
for their processing in the space-time domain are considered. 
 
Key-words:  Electromagnetic  field,  dynamical  system,  3-manifolds,  topological  computing,  artificial  spatial 
intelligence  
 

 
1. Introduction 
During last several months the increased attention has been paid to topology. Topology was 

established  by  H.  Poincare,  and  it  has  been  passed  more  then  100  years  of  the  fruitful 

developments. It studies the global characteristics of objects ignoring their exact geometrical 

features.  It  is  possible  to  find  many  applications  of  this  science,  but  one  of  them  is  very 

attractive  in  the  modeling  of  the  intelligence.  The  human  brain,  mostly,  operates  with  the 

qualitative defined information, and, the  visually based processing is prevailing towards the 

logical handling of digital-like information.  It allows defining that one of the types of human 

brain  activity  as  the  “spatial  intelligence.”  The  development  of  the  logical  theory  and  the 

hardware modeling is one of the most difficult tasks. The major part of the results is on the 

image  recognizing  by  pixel-to-pixel  methods  or  holographic-based  optical  recognition 

The  proposed  paper  is  on  the  electronic-based  hardware  to  handle  the  electromagnetic, 

topologically modulated impulses that carry the information by their field maps and impulse 

magnitudes.  It allows developing the electronic gates processing the images on the gate level 

and simulating the brain spatial activity by electronics. 

2. Field-Force Lines Pictures and their Topological Schemes 

Since the earlier years, it has been known that the fields surrounding the electrical charges 

and  magnets  have  certain  spatial  shapes.  M.  Faraday  used  the  idea  of  the  field-force  line 

pictures to visualize the fields and explain the found electromagnetic phenomena.  Later, J.C. 

Maxwell used the field-force lines to create his system of equations for the electromagnetic 

systems.

and

 are governed by the Maxwell equations, boundary and initial conditions.  

Qualitatively,  the  systems  (3)  and  (4)  are  described  by  the  ordered  sets  of  separatrices  of 

their  extended  4-D  phase  spaces  and  the  equilibrium  positions  where  the  fields  are  zero.  

These elements compose the topological scheme of a field similarly to the well-studied case 

on a plane [1,2]. Taking into account that the dimension of the systems (3) and (4) is four in 

general case, the separatrices of the phase space can be the 1-D, 2-D and 3-D manifolds.  Last 

of them have not been studied well [3-5]. For example, only recently the Poincarè conjecture 

was proofed in [6,7].  

In electromagnetics, the topological models of the dynamical systems (1) and (2) are used 

not  only  to  analyze  the  pre-computed  fields  but  to  derive  the  qualitative  solutions  of  the 

boundary  electromagnetic  problems  [8,9].  These  topological  solutions  of  electromagnetic 

problem consist of analytical or semi-analytical composing of topological schemes according

to  the  given  boundary  condition.    It  gives  a  rough  model  of  the  field  used  for  qualitative 

estimations or as an initial approximation for further problem treatment [10]. 

The developed theory and derived solutions for the electromagnetic problems in the space-

frequency  domain  allowed  proposing  the  idea  on  the  topological  modulation  of  the  field 

[8,11].  Logical  variables  are  assigned  to  different  topological  schemes,  and  the  signal  is  a 

series  of  field  impulses  with  their  discretely  modulated  spatio-temporal  forms.  In  general 

case, these digital shapes are composed from the manifolds of different dimensions, including 

the 3-D ones, and the developed hardware not only detects these topologically different field 

shapes but processes them according to the Boolean, predicate and constraint logics [11-19].  

 

3. Topologically Modulated Signals and Transmission Lines 

The idea of logical handling of topological field shapes was proposed during a research on 

the qualitative theory of the electromagnetic boundary problems. It was found that the field 

topological  schemes  are  changed  discretely,  and  for  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields,  it  is 

written  each  own  topological  scheme 

,  correspondingly.    Taking  into  account  the  time- 

,e hT

dependence of the fields, the considered schemes are the objects that have a certain shape in 

the 4-D phase space of the equations (3) and (4).   

The schemes of the i-th and j-th fields can be non-homeomorphic to each other 

e hT → ( )
j
e hT
,

i
( )
,

, 

and then a natural number i or j can be assigned to each scheme. For example, the modes of a 

transmission  line  can  have  non-homeomorphic  topological  schemes  of  their  fields,  and  they 

are  numbered  by  the  modal  numbers.  Additionally,  the  non-homeomorphic  schemes  can  be 

composed  from  arbitrary  combinations  of  modes,  as  well.  Generally  say,  the  number  of 

modes  and  their  combinations  is  infinite  for  a  given  transmission  line,  but  for  a  certain 

frequency  band  only  a  few  of  them  are  the  propagating  modes.  A  set  of  two  non-

homeomorphic  topological  schemes  of  the  propagating  modes  can  correspond  to  the  binary 

system{
i

=

0,

j

}

.  Manipulation  of  the  topological  schemes  according  to  a  digital 

modulation  signal  is  the  topological  field  modulation.  The  digital  operations  with  these 

signals are the topological computing.   

To support such signals, it was considered a number  of  waveguides.  Among  them  are  the 

rectangular  and  corrugated  waveguides,  coupled  strip-slot  line,  coupled  microstrip  line  and 

coupled strip line [12].  The first ones are the dispersive waveguides, and the modal impulses 

excited in such waveguides have non-separable spatial and temporal field part, and they are 

described with the extended autonomous systems (3) and  (4). 

 

3

A  much  more  studied  case  is  the  signaling  along  the  transversal  electromagnetic  (TEM) 

waveguides like the strip transmission line. In this case, the dynamical system describing the 

discretely  modulated  signal  is  still  non-autonomous,  but  each  impulse  of  the  field  can  be 

expressed  by  the  separable  spatial  and  temporal  parts,  i.e.  the  systems  (1)  and  (2)  are  the 

locally  autonomous  ones.  It  allowed  avoiding  some  difficulties  to  define  and  describe  the 

signals and hardware for them. 

 An example of signal transmitted along the coupled strip line is shown in Fig. 1. The last 

waveguide consists of two conducting strips placed at the dielectric substrate covered by the 

grounded conducting plates.  This line supports the even and odd modes.  The first mode has 

the  magnetic  plane  symmetry  of  the  field  at  the  central  line  axis.  The  odd  mode  field  is 

symmetrical  regard  to  the  electric  central  plane.  The  modal  field  topological  schemes  of 

these  modes  are  not  homeomorphic  to  each  other,  and  they  are  assigned  to  the  logical  “1” 

and  “0”,  correspondingly.  Then,  the  topologically  modulated  signal  is  a  series  of  modal 

impulses as shown in Fig. 1, and the signal “topology” is changed from impulse to impulse. 

Besides  the  field  topology,  the  carrier  of  information  is  the  impulse  magnitude,  and  the 

signals introduced in [11] are the two-placed objects. The predicate logic theory for them was 

considered in [14].

4. Hardware Theory for Topologically Modulated Signals 

In general, the proposed topologically modulated signals are more complicated objects then 

the 3-D manifolds [3-7]. The signal topological schemes consist of an ordered set of vector 

separatrices-manifolds,  including  the  3-D  ones,  in  general  case,  and  the  field  equilibrium 

positions. 

The  developed  theory  and  circuitry  allows  not  only  detects  the  different  spatio-temporal 

field shapes but compare them according to the Boolean, predicate and constrained logic. In 

[12-14],  the  reconfigurable  “in-the-fly”  hardware  is  shown.  It  was  proposed  to  build  such 

hardware using analogies with the matched filters when the outputs of a gate are tuned to a 

certain modal type or a spatio-temporal signal topology [12-14,15].  

The theory of the components was created using the conservation law written for the power 

flows

 in each n-th arm cross-section and the energy W stored in the gate volume

This expression reminds the Ricci flow equation used by topologists to study the manifolds 

[3-7].  It  shows  the  evolution  of  the  geometry  of  the  excited  fields  to  a  steady  state  if  a 

transient happens with the incident field.  The geometry of the field force line maps inside the 

transformer  and  in  the  output  arms  depends  nonlinearly  on  the  input  fields  and  the 

relationships of their amplitudes. The maps can be changed discretely by a smooth variation 

of the incident field parameters. Particularly, it allows controlling the field distribution of the 

output  fields.  If  the  output  field  is  close  to  a  propagating  mode  of  the  n-th  output,  then  the 

matching  conditions  allow  transmitting  the  maximal  power  of  the  incident  signal  to  this 

output.  Other  terminals  can  be  isolated  from  the  input  if  this  signal  excites  the  evanescent 

modes  in  them.    Then,  the  switching  of  the  input  signal  from  one  output  to  another  can  be 

realized  choosing  the  input  signal  parameters.  Additionally,  the  semiconductor  components 

can realize the time signal processing. 

5. Logical Circuitry 

 The first hardware for topologically modulated signals was proposed in 1992 [11].  It deals 

with the signals in the waveguides with the strong dispersion to whom a complete theory (3) 

and  (4)  should  be  applied.  As  well,  the  low-dispersion  microstrip  and  strip  lines  were 

considered, and the logic circuitry was patented.

The first experimental results are shown in [17] where the microwave impulses are switched 

by a passive circuit into different circuit arms. The developed switches allowed proposing the 

AND, NOT and OR gates handling the information written to the field topology.  

The components for the predicate logic are considered in [14,18,19]. They allow handling 

the information contained in the signal amplitudes and topological schemes, and they are the 

two-place signals. 

 Additionally  to  the  predicate  circuitry,  the  topologically  modulated  impulses  allow 

designing the reconfigurable gates [13,14].  For this purpose, one of the logical levels can be 

assigned  to  control  the  logical  operation  of  the  gate.  Depending  on  the  signal  magnitude 

level,  the  NOT  gate,  for  example,  can  be  transformed  into  a  follower  for  the  information 

contained  in  the  spatial  maps  of  the  electromagnetic  signals.    Next,  the  amplitude 

relationship  can  define  the  type  of  logical  operations  in  a  universal  gate  OR/AND  that 

handling  the  topological  charts.  Then,  this  gate  can  be  incorporated  into  a  flip-flop  of 

reconfigurable logic, and even a reconfigurable processor can be designed.  

The  proposed  and  studied  two-place  signals  are  pertinent  for  reversible  computations.  In 

[11],  several  passive  circuits  are  studied  that  are  reversible  physically  and  logically.  They 

consist  of  completely  passive  components  based  on  the  interference  of  the  electromagnetic 

waves or combinations of passive and semiconductor components.  Later, similar way was 

studied in [20]. 

 

6. Conclusions and Future Research 
It has been considered the electromagnetic signals carrying the digital information by their 

spatio-temporal  field  structures  and  magnitudes.  The  spatio-temporal  carrier  is  the 

topological scheme of  the extended 4-D phase space of differential equations for field-force 

lines composed of the manifolds-separatrices and equilibrium field positions. The performed 

research touches the detecting and logical processing such topological signals. These signals 

are processed by the logical circuitry designed on the spatio-time filtration.  

The research relates to the developments of the principles and hardware for modeling the 

spatial  artificial  intelligence  [21].  Last  one  is  defined  as  “a  skill”  to  handle  the  spatio-

temporal information. It is supposed that the information process is based on the parallel-like 

effects and structures, and the human mind and body handle the global spatial information, at 

the first, on the qualitative level [14,22,23]. It means that the topological approaches to the 

signal processing and computing are a key component to understand and model such a type 

of intellectual skills [18].

Abstract: 
 
A  general  equation  of  state  for  the  hard-body reference system of real fluid has been developed from 
first principles, statistical mechanical arguments using metric differential geometry to describe the “available vol-
ume,” V0, and its determining surface,  S0, of a hard-body fluid.  The rigorous, exact results of scaled particle the-
ory of Reiss  et al., which themselves obtain from statistical geometry, have been applied following the extension 
of Boublík et al. for hard bodies of non-spherical shape.  The geometric description of the hard-body system can 
be used with the Boublík equation of state at low and modest densities.  At high densities, this geometric descrip-
tion specifies the procedure to specify V0 and S0, notwithstanding that both become multiply-connected.

Introduction. 
1. 
 
There is a need among physicists working in chemical physics, geophysicists, chemists, and chemical 
engineers for a rigorous, general equation of state that is valid for molecules of arbitrary shape and in arbitrary 
regimes of temperature and pressure.  The equations of state now commonly used, such as the Redlich-Kwong 
or  Suave  equations,  have  been  fitted  to  convenient  experimental  measurements,  and  are  therefore  invalid in 
regimes of temperature and pressure outside their range of fitting, or for compounds other than those to which 
the fittings were made.  Others, such as those based on the formalism of the Hard-Chain Theory [HCT], in-
volve invalid assumptions, like the basis of the commonly-used “Prigogine c-factor.” 
 
Geophysicists need to describe and predict the behavior of chemically reactive systems in regimes of 
temperature and pressure found in the depths of the Earth.  There exist very few measured data for minerals or 
compounds in the thermodynamic regimes of the Earth’s depths.  Therefore, valid geophysical predictions must 
depend upon the validity of the equation of state used. 
 
The number of synthesized chemical compounds already exceeded 6 million at the end of the last cen-
tury.1  With the developments of chemical synthesis, major pharmaceutical companies expect to synthesize ap-
proximately 100,000 new compounds yearly.  Each time a new compound is synthesized and determined to be 
of commercial value, the scientists and chemical engineers involved are confronted with the tasks of separation, 
purification,  and  production on an industrial scale in quantities of tons of a material previously known only in 
quantities of grams (or kilograms), and for which the physical properties of the compound, such as its density 
as a function of pressure and temperature, are almost always unknown.  When the compound(s) of interest 
involves a mixture, its physical properties must be predictable as functions of the composition of the system.   
These  tasks  require  a  general  equation  of  state  which  must  involve  no  fitted  parameters  or  additive 
 
constants.  This equation of state must require only minimal physical properties of the individual molecule which 
can be measured separately, e.g., such as the molecular geometry and the shape of its electronic cloud which 
can  be  obtained  from  the  x-ray  scattering  form  factor.    Such  equation  of  state  must  be  derived  from  first-
principles,  quantum  statistical  mechanics  arguments  in  order  hold  for  arbitrary regimes of  temperature and 
pressure. 
 
This article reports the first part of the development of a rigorous equation of state, derived from first-
 
principles,  statistical  mechanics  arguments,  and  applicable  to  real  molecules  of  non-convex shape in general 
regimes of temperature and pressure.  This analysis uses the technique of the factored partition function enunci-
ated first by Bogolyubov2, later independently by Feynman,3, and  developed substantially by Yukhnovskii.4-7.  
The factored canonical partition function applies a “reference system” together with a subsidiary partition func-
tion, such that the quantal canonical partition function has the form:

The first factor on the right side of equation  (1) is the partition function for the reference system, which sub-
sumes the Ideal Gas partition function together also with that resulting from the short-range, repulsive, hard-
core  component  of  the  intermolecular  potential.    The  second  factor  accounts  for  the  long-range,  attractive, 
weak component of the intermolecular potential, often designated the van der Waals component. 
 
The  use  of  the  factored  partition  function  in  equation  (1) represents a generalization of the adiabatic 
formalism used in molecular and solid state physics whereby the quantal state vector of the system is described 
in terms of the factors of a state vector for the electronic system which is a parametric function of the nuclear 
coordinates, and another for the nuclear coordinates:

In equation  (2), the lower case variables represent the electronic coordinates, and the upper case ones the nu-
clear coordinates (typically, the phonon system).  The factoring process involved in equations (1) and (2) does 
not introduce,  per se, any approximation or imprecision;  only such specific approximations as may be intro-
duced to either factor introduces imprecision.

This article addresses the development of the partition function, and its related equation of state, for the 
hard-core reference system:  Qref, pref.  The reference system used here is that of the fluid of hard-body parti-
cles.  The factor in the partition function which describes the effects of the weak, attractive, long-range inter-
molecular interaction, and the component of pressure which obtains from it, will be the subject of a following 
article. 
 
The short-range, repulsive, hard-core component of the intermolecular potential obtains from the Jor-
dan-Pauli  exclusion  principle  which  (as  its  name  implies)  dictates  that  every  molecule  occupies  a  volume of 
space into which another molecule cannot be injected.  This most fundamentally  quantal property determines 
the motivating perspective of the hard-body fluid and its analysis by statistical geometry.8-10 
 
 
In a previous article,11 on the high-pressure physics of multi-component systems, the effects of geome-
try on the evolution of hard-body systems at high densities were examined generally.  In another previous arti-
cle,12 the effects of geometry upon the evolution of many-body systems of real molecules at high densities were 
examined for the very restricted case of mixtures of molecules of equal volume whose geometries were identi-
cal except for being chiral enantiomers.  In a more recent article,13 the effects of geometry upon the evolution of 
the  real,  chemically-reactive,  many-body,  hydrogen-carbon  [H-C] system were analyzed at high densities in 
order to determine the thermodynamic regimes of pressure at which the compounds heavier than methane can 
be  generated  spontaneously.    This  article  analyses  the  hard-body fluid for particles of general convex shape 
and of a representative number of non-convex shapes, and relates their molecular geometry to the sub-volume 
of the system into which another particle can be injected, designated the “available volume.”

Section 5 introduces the development by Boublík23 et al.24 of the extension of scaled particle theory to 
 
hard-body molecules of arbitrary, but still convex, geometries, and the use of the Steiner-Kihara parameters in 
scaled particle theory. 
Section 6 returns to the concept and use of the “surface of exclusion” into which no particle may be 
 
inserted, as was introduced by Boltzmann and used by Reiss et al., and introduces the formalism of metric dif-
ferential geometry to describe the geometry of hard-body particles.  The restriction that the hard-body mole-
cules be convex is removed.  The surface parameter used by Steiner and Kihara, SS-K, is replaced by the perti-
nent “exclusionary surface” determined by the particular geometry of the molecule(s) considered.  The Steiner-
Kihara radial parameter,  RS-K, is generalized to the mean extrinsic curvature of the bounding surface.  The use 
of metric differential geometry of embedded surfaces to describe the geometry of hard-body particles removes 
the constraint of convexity, while preserving the exactness of the scaled particle theory.  Definition of the mean 
extrinsic curvature locally requires only that the surface of exclusion be oriented and piecewise twice differenti-
able;  computing the integral requires that the surface be bounded; the surface may be otherwise irregular, non-
convex, and even multiply-connected. 
 
Section 7 catalogues computed values of the geometric parameters  R, S, and V for some convex and 
non-convex  surfaces  with  saddle-shaped  regions.    For  all  of  convex  shapes,  the  respective  values  of  the 
Steiner-Kihara parameters, RS-K, SS-K, and VS-K, are identical those developed by the differential geometry of 
embedded surfaces.  The method of Kihara for computing R is extended to non-convex shapes. 
 
Section 8 catalogues computed values of the geometric parameters R, S, and V for several convex and 
non-convex  surfaces  that  are  typical  of  the  shapes  of  molecules  or  of  excluded  volumes  of  molecules.    The 
Boublík  parameter of asphericity,  aBoublík = RS/3V, is shown to be equal for a non-convex hard-body mole-
cule, in many cases, to that for a convex molecule possessing certain geometric similarities.  Because the Bou-
blík parameter of asphericity describes the geometric properties of molecules in scaled particle theory, this use-
ful  property  justifies  the  modeling  of  (often  complicated)  non-convex molecules by simpler convex ones in 
thermodynamic analyses. 
 
Section 9 compares some thermodynamic quantities computed from this  theory with empirical meas-
urements.  The computed values of the Boublík parameter of asphericity,  a, and of the hard-body parameter 
representing the volume of exclusion agree with the experimentally measured geometric properties of the nor-
mal alkane molecules, CnH2n+2.

2. 
 
The  general  equation  of  state  which  directly  determines  the 
pressure,  temperature,  and  density  of  a  fluid  is  given  by  statistical 
geometry in terms of the “available volume” of the fluid,  V0, and the 
boundary  of  the  space  determined  by  that  volume,  S0.8,  25-28    The 
available volume,  V0, is defined as the averaged space available for 
insertion of another particle into the system; and its surface, S0, is the 
corresponding  area  which  separates  that  available  space  from  the 
unavailable volume, (V - V0).

dimension  of  length  which  measures  the  averaged  distance  from  a 
point  to  the  surface,  S0,  that  determines  the  volume into which no 
part of another particle can intrude. 
This general equation of state, (4), relates the thermodynamic 
 
properties of a fluid to an intrinsic geometric property of its compo-
nent particles,  R% ,  and  to  the  geometry  of  an  abstract  surface,  S0, 
which in turn depends on both the intrinsic geometries of its compo-
nents and also the system density.  For a hard-sphere gas in regimes 
of dilute  to  moderate  density,  R% is  the  radius  of  the  individual hard 
spheres.  For a fluid of convex hard-body particles,  R%  is the radial 
parameter as defined by Steiner and Kihara.  As is shown in sections 
below, generally, and for particles that are not necessarily convex nor 
even simply-connected, the parameter  R%  is the “extrinsic curvature,” the integral over the surface S0 of the ex-
trinsic curvature tensor of Riemann, EK, (called, sometimes, the “second fundamental form”). 
 
The equation of state,  (4), has an interesting history.  In the late 1970’s, equation  (4) was derived by 
Speedy14-16  for  a  hard-sphere  gas,  applying  arguments  that  used  a  lattice-gas  formalism  which  were  subse-
quently passed to a continuum.  Several years later, Reiss17 derived equation (1) directly and rigorously using 
scaled particle theory.  In 1984, Montroll29 pointed out that this equation of state was known to Boltzmann. 
 
Equation  (4)  obtains  from  general  arguments  of  statistical  geometry,  and  is  not  dependent  upon any 
specific approximate formalism, such as the Kirkwood or Percus-Yevick equations.  Equations (5) and (4) are 
not restricted to hard-body fluids, and hold also when there exists an attractive component to the intermolecu-
lar potential.

ume, V0, replacing the system volume, V.

overlap, the concentric dotted lines representing the surfaces from which the centers of another sphere are ex-

The development by Scaled Particle Theory [SPT] of the equation of state specified by statis-
tical geometry. 
 
The  first  step  of  scaled  particle  theory  determines  the  conditional  probability,  P(r), that no particle 
might exist within a spherical region of radius  r.  Consider a fluid of  N particles in volume V, characterized by 
the density  r = N/V.  With the definition of  P(r), the probability that no particle exists in the expanded region 
of radius r + dr is:

In equation  (9), the limit condition  P(0) = 1 has been used.  In equations  (8) and (9), the particles have been

aspherical entities, such factors assume the qualities of averaged values. 
 
To be noted particularly is that equation  (9) involves no physical constants,  neither Boltzmann’s, nor 
Planck’s constant, nor the speed of light, nor any other;  nor does it contain temperature explicitly.  The reason 
for this attribute is that equation  (9) is an expression of statistical geometry, and is independent both of thermal 
variables and any physical constant which might set a unique scale to its regime of validity.  Thus, the condi-
tional probability, P(r) given by  (9), describes the distribution of macroscopic grains and voids in such as po-

This scaled particle theory equation of state for a hard-sphere fluid, (10) represents one of the (very) few ex-
actly solvable models in statistical mechanics.  Equation (10) is often referred to, inappropriately, as the Per-
cus-Yevick equation.  Correctly, equation (10) should be called the Reiss-Frisch-Lebowitz equation, for it was 
derived and published,8 a few years before the Percus-Yevick solution, and owes nothing to it. 
Carnahan and Starling31 later developed an equation of state for the hard-sphere gas by summing a se-
 
ries fitted to the values of the first seven virial coefficients obtained from Monte Carlo simulations which is iden-
tical to equation (10) with an additional cubic term in the packing fraction, h:

The  geometric  description  by  Steiner  and  Kihara  of  a  system  of  convex,  aspherical,  hard-
body particles. 
 
The first systematic and rigorous analysis of the thermo-
dynamics of aspherical  hard-body  systems in terms of their ge-
ometry were carried out by Kihara and Steiner.20,  21  Kihara and 
Steiner  described  the  geometry  of  hard-body  particles in terms 
of  three  parameter  functionals,  R,  S, and  V,  which  they  deter-
mined  from  the  support  function  that  describes the volume and 
surface  generated  by  the  rolling  of  one  hard  body  around  the 
surface  of  another,  in all possible orientations.  Steiner and Ki-
hara used a procedure involving the parallel planes, separated by 
the  vector  of  magnitude  r  normal  to  the  surface  of  the  hard 
body,  as  indicated  schematically in  Fig.  2.    Steiner  and  Kihara 
allowed the second convex hard body to roll, in all possible ori-
entations,  against  a  point  of  contact  on  that  parallel  plane,  and 
thenafter  allowed that plane to touch the first convex hard body 
at all points on its surface.  Finally, the magnitude of the vector, 
u, normal to the surface of the first convex hard body to the par-
allel plane(s) to go to zero. 
 
The  parameter  functional  R  represents  the  averaged 
half-distance  of  the  centers  of  two  particles,  and  S  the  surface 
area determined by  R;    in  this  instance, V does not necessarily 
represent  the  partial  volume  of  the  hard-body particle itself but 
the effective volume determined by the support function.  In or-
der to assist visualization of the support function and the mathematical entities which enter the Steiner-Kihara 
equations, a two-dimensional representation of a typical element of the development of  R, S, and V, is shown 
in Fig. 2.  The individual functionals R, S, and V, are defined by the equations:

The Boublík equation of state for systems of convex hard-body particles. 
5. 
 
Pavlícek,  Nezbeda,  and  Boublík24  analyzed  the  equations  developed  by  scaled  particle  theory  for 
aspherical,  convex,  hard  bodies.    Pavlícek  et  al. recognized that the equations for the two-body correlation 
function, and its derivative, as appear in equations  (7) and (8), must depend upon the relative orientations of 
the two hard-bodies, such that  G = G(r,q,f).  They integrated out the angular variables in the resulting equa-
tions following the technique of Steiner and Kihara, and developed a rigorous equation of state for aspherical 
(but convex) hard-body particles which involves only the averaged geometric parameters R, S, and V.   Bou-
blík (1981)18,  32 further refined the extension of scaled particle theory for mixtures of hard-body particles of dif-
ferent  sizes  and  shapes  and  developed  the  following  analytical  expression for the pressure of the hard-body 
fluid in terms of their respective geometric parameters R, S, and V:

Similarly, when the identities  (19) are used, the equations for the contribution of the reference system

S0, and V0 are developed using metric differential geometry. 
 
 
6. 

The general description of hard-body particles and the development of the geometric pa-
rameters R, S, and V using metric differential geometry. 
In this section, the description of the geometry of a hard-body particle is developed in terms of the pa-

 
rameters R, S, and V using metric differential geometry.  The resulting parameters R, S, and V so developed 
are independent of the choice of coordinate systems, both in 3-space and also on the surface of the body, and 
describe generally hard bodies that are convex, non-convex, and even multiply-connected. 
Consider a body B that is a smooth 3-manifold-with-boundary embedded in Euclidean 3-space. Its 
 
boundary ¶ B is a 2-surface embedded in 3-space.  First, universal coordinate-invariant expressions for the 
area of ¶ B and the volume of B are reviewed;  thenafter the parameter R is developed. 
6.1.  Coordinate-invariant expressions for the surface, S, and the volume, V. 
 
include:  (1), Cartesian coordinates, xi = (x,y,z);  (2), spherical coordinates, xi = (r,q,f).  Let gij = metric ten-
sor on 3-space (i,j = 1,2,3).  The metric tensor, gij, captures the information about lengths and inner products 
of vectors, where the inner product of two vectors u and v is:  

Let xi (i = 1,2,3) be coordinates on Euclidean 3-space.  Examples of allowable coordinate systems

(Throughout this paper the Einstein index notation is used whereby the same letter, when used as an upper and 
lower index in the same tensor or product of tensors, indicates that the letter index is summed over its entire 
range.)  The metric tensor is symmetric, gij = gji, because inner products are symmetric, u·v = v·u. 
Here follow familiar examples of metric tensors:

The embedded 2-surface, ¶ B, is expressed in coordinate-invariant form as  follows.  Define a portion 
of ¶ B by three functions:  xi(u,v), where u and v form a local coordinate system on ¶ B.  A more compact no-
tation is to denote the coordinates (u,v) on ¶ B by wa, (a = 1,2), where w1 = u, w2 = v.   The metric gij on 3-
space defines lengths and angles on the surface  ¶ B;  therefore, it induces a metric tensor on  ¶ B.  Let  hab be 
this metric tensor on ¶ B.

This formulation of the geometry of Euclidean space and embedded surfaces is coordinate-invariant 
(but not coordinate-free), in the sense that there are straightforward methods for transforming all these con-
structions to another coordinate system so that lengths, angles, areas, and volumes are the same in the new co-
ordinates.  Let ya (a = 1,2,3) be a second set of coordinates on 3-space.  The keys to transforming between 
coordinate systems are:  the coordinate functions ya = ya(xi) and their inverse functions xi = x i(ya);  and the 
Jacobian matrix of the partial derivatives ¶ xi/¶ ya and its inverse matrix ¶ ya/¶ xi.

vector parallel to  ¶ B as it is translated along g .  This acceleration can always be chosen normal to ¶ B because 
parallel  translation  in  3-space and parallel translation of tangents to  ¶ B both preserve lengths.  The extrinsic 
curvature of the surface ¶ B is the length of the acceleration vector needed to make a tangent to ¶ B remain tan-
gent to ¶ B during translation.  At each point of  ¶ B, the extrinsic curvature depends on two vectors tangent to 
¶ B:  the translated vector (u in this discussion);  and the direction of motion (dg /dt in the discussion above).  
Therefore the extrinsic curvature is a two-index tensor, or matrix, denoted EKaß.  EKab describes how the sur-
face  ¶ B  sits  in  3-space;  and it describes how the differentiation of vectors on  ¶ B, treated as vectors in 3-
space,  differs  from  such  treated  as  vectors on  ¶ B.  If the coordinates  wa are orthonormal at a point on  ¶ B, 
then  the  eigenvalues  1/R1 and 1/R2 of  EK are the principle curvatures of  ¶ B at that point, and the respective 
eigenvectors of EK are the directions of the principle curvature of the surface ¶ B at that point.

The mean extrinsic curvature averaged over the surface ¶ B is the integral of the mean curvature with respect to 
the area form: 

The radial parameter,  R, is now defined as  R = M/(4p ) in order to be consistent with the convention used by 
Kihara and Boublík.. 
 
The invariant R has now been constructed for an arbitrary, bounded, smooth, oriented manifold-with-
boundary embedded in Euclidean 3-space.   This definition yields a unique result for surfaces which are both 
convex and non-convex, and also for surfaces which are multiply-connected.  The surface must be oriented in 
order that EK is defined globally on the surface because the definition of  EK depends on a choice of normal 
vector field on the surface.  (The embedding 3-space is assumed to be oriented; and the right-hand rule and an 
orientation on the surface into a normal vector field have been used.)

In his 1953 paper20 (page 840), Kihara wrote of the average of his support function, H,  “… 
 
4p<H>Ave is equal to the mean curvature integrated over the whole surface of the convex body…”  His equa-
tion (7.6) indicates that his parameter M equals the general integral for the mean extrinsic curvature.  However, 
Kihara’s terminology makes no distinction between the extrinsic curvature (which is a property of the embed-
ding and not of the metric surface), and the intrinsic Riemann curvature (which is a property of the metric sur-
face itself).  Kihara’s method of computing M depends on the convexity of the body enclosed by the surface, 
or, more precisely, on the star-shaped property that there exists a point inside the enclosed volume which has a 
clear line of sight to all points on the boundary surface.  Kihara makes no mention of extending the definition of 
M to non-convex (or non-star-shaped) bodies.  Such computations are best performed using tensor calculus 
that is beyond the scope of the vector calculus used by Kihara.  The computation of the mean curvature curva-
tures for many figures is given in the next section using tensor calculus.  The computations were executed using 
the Macsyma software package, which has extensive symbolic integration capabilities, and which introduced 
the automatic computation of extrinsic curvature around 1996.

Explicit development of the geometric parameters R, S, and V for convex bodies using metric 
differential geometry. 
In this section, the geometric parameters, R, S, and V, are developed explicitly for the most common 
 
convex hard bodies.  For this development, the symbolic mathematics program Macsyma has been used to 
compute the mean extrinsic curvature,  R, and, for some figures, the surface area or enclosed volume. The ge-
ometric parameters R, S, and V are defined as follows:  S = surface area,  R = 1/(4p )· (mean extrinsic curva-
ture) of that surface, V = volume subtended by S.

Let the axial length of the cylinder be L, and the radius of the cylinder be (q + p – (cid:214) (q2- z2)), where z is 

Circular cylinder with inverted circular radius 
 
the axial coordinate of the cylinder.  In an r–z cross-section, the radius of this cylinder is formed by a circle of 
radius q whose point of closest approach to the axis of the cylinder is p.  In order to evaluate the integral for 
the mean extrinsic curvature, a Taylor series of the above expression to the eighth order is used.  All results 
quoted for the inverted-circle cylinder for R and S after this point use the eighth-order Taylor approximation for 
the radius.  The results for the volume are exact.

Shapes with sharp edges. 

 
7.3 
The general case 
 
Consider two flat surfaces which meet at an angle q along a straight edge of length L.  Let the edge be 
rounded with radius r.  The principal curvature transverse to the edge is 1/r, and the principal curvature along 
the edge is zero.  Therefore the mean extrinsic curvature is 1/(2 r) = ½ (1/r + 0) on the curved sector of angle 
q, and zero on the flat surfaces.  The area of the curved sector is rq L, so the integral of the mean extrinsic cur-
vature over the entire surface is ½ q L.  Dividing by 4p in order to be consistent with the convention used by 
Kihara, the geometric shape parameter R is: 

(49)

. 

This result is independent of the radius of curvature r, so it holds for a sharp edge with exterior angle q.

More generally, consider an edge with a sharp angle (or rounded with radius r) with parameter z along 
 
the length of the edge.  Let the exterior angle at which the two surfaces meet be q (z).  Then the contribution of 
the edge to the geometric parameter R of the surface is: 
D = (cid:243)

In particular, if q is constant along an edge of length L, then the contribution of the edge to the parameter R is:

These last two results also hold for a sharp edge that is curved along its axis, because the principal curvature 
along the edge is finite, and the domain of integration as a two-dimensional surface is infinitely narrow.  Some 
specific examples of figures containing sharp edges are now computed.

Conditions Ensuring that Kihara’s R is the Mean Extrinsic Curvature. 
7.3 
That the mean curvature of Riemann gives the averaged center-to-center half-distance of two convex 
 
hard-body particles as  one  rolls upon the entire surface of the other raises immediately the question, to what 
extent does this equality hold for non-convex hard bodies.  Here follow certain conditions on the principal ex-
trinsic curvatures of  ¶ b which ensure that the mean extrinsic curvature yields the same result as Kihara’s con-
struction of R in terms of rolling molecules over one another.

Assume that the maximum magnitude of a principal radius of curvature on any concave patch of ¶ b is 

less than the minimum magnitude of a principal radius of curvature on any convex patch of ¶ b, that is,

. 

(54) 

When this condition,  (54), is satisfied, then any part of  ¶ b fits tangentially to any other part of ¶ b, at least lo-
cally.  Such a local curvature condition cannot guarantee that tangency of arbitrary points can be arranged, be-
cause of possible interference of distance parts of the molecules. If this curvature condition is satisfied, the inte-
gral of the mean extrinsic curvature over the entire surface is identical to Kihara’s parameter R, except for the 
possibility of interference if distant parts of the molecules in Kihara’s construction.  

If the condition  (54) is not satisfied, then it may be necessary to exclude (or otherwise adjust for) cer-
tain concave patches of  ¶ b from the surface integral defining the mean extrinsic curvature, in order that the re-
sult is identical to the result of Kihara’s construction in terms of molecules rolling over one another.

Development of the geometric parameters R, S, and V for non-convex hard-body particles 
using metric differential geometry. 
 
In this section are developed the geometric parameters, R, S, and V, for hard bodies which are explic-
itly non-convex.  In the cases which follow, the geometric parameters are developed partly as a formal exege-
sis and partly for reference.  Most of the particular hard bodies described in this section are not those which 
are applicable for a statistical mechanical argument, for their respective surfaces do not represent the surfaces 
of exclusion, S0, into which no part of another particle can intrude, as used in equation (4).

Consider a figure consisting of N 
spheres that are tangent to one another.  
Whether the spheres are arranged in a lin-
ear chain or a branched or ring structure 
has no effect on the geometric parameters 
R, S, and V.  The points of tangency con-
tribute nothing to either the surface area or 
the volume of the figure. They also con-
tribute nothing to the curvature parameter 
R, because each is a sharp edges of exte-
rior angle p
geometric parameters R, S, and V, for a 
figure consisting of N tangent spheres is just N times the parameters for one sphere. 
 
Tangent  spheres  are  not  good 
models of chemical bonds nor even of clus-
tered  particles,  for  their  surfaces  do  not 
faithfully  represent  the  regions  of  space 
from  which  other  particles  are  excluded.  
Nonetheless,  the  geometric  figures  de-
scribed below include regions that may be 
considered  to  include  bonds  between  at-
oms;  and  their  geometric  parameters R, S, 
and  V  are  computed  below  and  will  be 
compared to the parameters appropriate for physical molecules.

Linear chain of tangent spheres with inverted-circle cylindrical bonds: 
 
This case is identical to the previous one, except that the spheres are tangent, and straight cylinders are 
replaced by cylinders whose radii have the shape of inverted circles.  An example of this case is shown in Fig. 
5 for three touching spheres, arranged as a linear collineation.  Recall that results for R and S employ an 
eighth-order Taylor series approximation for the radius of the cylinder, so they contain either polynomials in L 
and, when L is solved for, large integers.  Floating point approximations for the geometric parameters R, S, 
and V for this special case are:

Unlike the previous models of over-

 
lapping spheres and chains 
 with cylindrical bonds, this particular model 
is  particularly  relevant  for  the  analysis  of 
linear  clusters  of  molecules,  for  its  surface 
plainly  does    represent  faithfully  that  into 
which  no  part  of  another sphere can pene-
trate.  This model represents the linear clus-
ters of spherical molecules which participate 
in  the  gas-liquid phase transition, as will be 
shown in an article to follow.

Experimental validation of the use of the geometric parameters developed by differential ge-

In  the  previous  sections,  it  has  been  shown  that  often  an  infinite  number  of  hard-body molecules of 
quite different geometric parameters  R, S, and V can manifest the same Boublík coefficient a, and that further-
more, if they possess the same intrinsic volume of exclusion, V, they will have identical thermodynamic proper-

cules, the normal alkanes. 
 
In  Fig.  6,  is  shown  a  ball-&-stick  representation of the 
real  molecule  n-octane,  a  typical  member  of  the  class of normal 
alkane compounds.  N-octane is plainly not a convex molecule, as 
also are none of the n-alkanes.  However, the n-alkanes may be 
considered  to  possess  a  statistically  averaged  axis  of  rotation 
along  its  length.    Because  the  n-alkanes  have  the properties of 
chains  of  CH2  radicals,  they  possess  also  an  average  length-to-
breadth ratio.  Therefore, one may reasonably model the n-alkane 
molecules  effectively  as  prolate  spherocylinders,  and  calculate 
their respective Boublík coefficients of asphericity, a = RS/3u using that model. 
 
The  thermodynamic  properties  of  the  normal  alkanes  have  been  analyzed  using  the formalism of the 
Simplified Perturbed Hard-Chain Theory37-41 [SPHCT].  The SPHCT uses first-principles statistical mechanics 
arguments to develop the following equation of state:

and the factor t was introduced ad hoc to “correct” it.  The result is only that the true, hard-core parameter for 
the SPHCT equation is  tV*, and its volume parameters, V*, are always conventionally stated oversized.)  The 
first two terms on the right side of equation  (59) represent the contribution to the pressure from the hard-core 
reference system;  the last term represents the contribution of the long-range, attractive, van der Waals com-
ponent of the intermolecular potential, in which Y = exp(T*/2T) -1, where T* is a characteristic temperature of 
the system. 
In equation  (59), the parameter,  cSPHCT,  multiplying  the  contributions  to the pressure both from the 
 
hard-core  and  the  van  der  Waals  components  of  the  intermolecular  potential,    is  known  as  the  Prigogine 
“c-factor.”  Prigogine originally argued42,  43 that the c-factor should account for a modification of the dimensions 
of the partition function of the system attributable to the interaction of certain of the of molecular vibrations and 
rotations with the translational degrees of freedom.  Prigogine’s original arguments do not stand up to scrutiny;  
and it has been shown11 that his  “c-factor” is, in fact, a shape-factor that accounts somewhat, at low densities, 
for  the effects of molecular asphericity and approximates the Boublík coefficient of asphericity,  (1+3a)/4, in 
the low-density regime.

When the Prigogine  c-factor is recognized as an approximation to the Boublík coefficient of aspheric-
 
ity, a, the product of the Prigogine c-factor and the SPHCT hard-core volume, tV*, can be related directly to 
the factor of the function of the Boublík coefficient  and the geometric volume parameter, uB, through the sec-
ond virial coefficient.  The hard-core component of the second virial coefficient for the *hard-core reference

ted the values of the Prigogine c-factor for the first ten n-

values  of  the  pressure-density curves, and also the cal-
culated  Boublík  asphericity  parameters,  a.  In  Fig.  7, 
the Prigogine  c-factors  are  plotted  as  scatter  points  in 
white  squares;    the  Boublík  asphericity parameters are 
plotted as black circles and a dotted trace.   
The  agreement  shown  in  Fig.  7  is  obvious.    It  cannot  be  emphasized  too  strongly  that  the  white 
 
squares, which represent the respective Prigogine  c-factors, were obtained solely by fitting the SPHCT equa-
tion of state to the experimental pressure-density curves.  There is  no underlying theoretical reasoning behind 
the  values  of  those  white  squares;    they  represent  solely  experimental data fitted to the SPHCT equation of 
state, (59).  Similarly it cannot be emphasized too strongly also that the black circles and the dotted line con-
necting them, which represent the values of (1+3a)/4t, were obtained solely from equation  (62), with no ex-
perimental input.  There have been no added fitting parameters used.

Discussion. 
10. 
 
The  geometric  parameters  of  a  hard  body, S, V, and R, which describe respectively the surface and 
volume of exclusion into which no part of another particle can be injected, and the mean half-distance of one 
particle as it rolls upon another in all possible orientations, have been extended using metric differential geome-
try.  These radial parameters have been demonstrated to be the same parameters  R, S, and V developed by 
Kihara for convex hard-bodies, and have been extended for non-convex and multiply-connected bodies (like 
tori or donuts).  This extension has been based upon the extrinsic curvature of (n-1)-dimensional surfaces em-
bedded in Euclidean n-space.  We present R, S and V for a range of convex and non-convex shapes, including 
chains of spheres in which molecular bonds are represented by sharp seams, or straight cylinders, or by “in-
verted-circle” cylinders.

systems. 
The  statistical  thermodynamic  description  of  a  sin-
 
gle-component, hard-body system in terms of its geometric 
parameters of R, S, and V, is not unique.  As set forth in the 
Boublík equation of state, (18), the thermodynamic proper-
ties of the system are described completely by is volume of 
exclusion,  V,  and  its  respective  Boublík  parameter  of 
asphericity,  a = RS/3V.  For given values of the geometric 
parameters  V  and  a,  there  exist  infinitely  many  different 
geometric  shapes.    For  example, a prolate  spherocylinder 
with  aspect  ratio  (length-to-breadth)  g =  6 and  volume  V 
= 45,  will  have  the  cross-section  s = 2.1624 and Boublík 
parameter a = 2.470.  There exist also infinitely many par-
allelepipeds  with  the  same  volume and Boublík parameter.  
This property is demonstrated graphically in Fig. 8 in which 
every point on the solid line represents a parallelepiped with 
the  same  parameters  V and  a.  The solid trace in  Fig.  8 
represents the ratio of the surface parameter of a parallele-
piped to the length of its longest side, for a chosen typical 
magnitude of one of the other sides.  In addition to the par-
allelepipeds with the maximum and minimum values for this 
ratio, there plainly  exists infinitely other parallelepipeds with 
the  same  parameters  V and  a.    Similarly  there  exist  also 
infinitely many ellipsoids with the same parameters, and also 
infinitely many irregular hard-bodies. 
Thus, although the geometric properties of a hard-
 
body determine its statistical thermodynamic properties, the 
inverse  statement  is  not  true.    The  volume  parameter  V  uniquely  determines  the  packing-fraction  h = rV.  
However, that parameter together with the surface parameter and its mean exterior curvature  enter the equa-
tion  of  state  only  in  combination  through  the  Boublík  parameter  of  asphericity,  a.  Therefore, the geometric 
parameters of the hard-body system are not one-to-one with its thermodynamic properties, but one-to-many.

In  this  respect,  the  geometric  description  of  the  hard-body system through is parameters  R, S, and V deter-
mines the statistical mechanical behavior of a system analogously as the parameters describing the inertial ellip-
soid of a rigid body determines its mechanical behavior:  Just  as a rigid body shaped as an ellipsoid will have 
exactly the dynamical properties of that body, so also will infinitely many other, - and, typically, very irregular, - 
rigid bodies which possess the same ellipsoid of inertia. 
 
10.2  The  thermodynamic  specificity  of  the  geometric  properties  of  multi-component,  hard-body 

systems. 
 
The  thermodynamic  ambiguity  of  a  single-component, hard-body system is largely lifted by the pres-
ence of another component.  The Boublík equation,  (18), has the same form for multi- and single-component 
systems.  However, the Boublík coefficient of asphericity for multi-component systems involves products and 
quotients of weighted sums of the individual geometric parameters Ri, Si, and Vi, and is  sensitive to differences 
in shape.  The differences in the individual geometric parameters Ri, Si, and Vi, induce an excess volume on the 
mixed system, and thereby changes in the Gibbs free enthalpy.  At increased densities, the change in the Gibbs 
free enthalpy typically induces phase separation. 
 
This property of the excess volume induced by geometric differences of hard-body particles has been 
demonstrated for the most demanding case involving subtle geometric differences:  the phase separation of op-
tical enantiomers.  For optical enantiomers, the respective magnitudes of the geometric parameters Ri, Si, and 
Vi are identical, and differ only in their respective chirality.12  A formal development of the general mathematical 
technique for projecting out the respective chiral and achiral components of the geometric parameters R, S, and 
V is given in Appendix C. 
 
10.3  The thermodynamic description of a hard-body system at high density 
The rigorous development by differential geometry of the geometric parameters of the hard-body ref-
 
erence system admits accurate thermodynamic description of the system not only at both high and low densi-
ties.  The thermodynamic analysis is no longer restricted to convex hard-body particles in the low-density re-
gime  and  also  can  describe  the  system  when  the  available  volume  becomes  multiply  connected  in  the  high-
density regime. 
 
In the low-density regime, the available volume of the fluid,  V0, and the boundary of the space deter-
mined by that volume,  S0, are determined from the sums of the respective individual molecular geometric pa-
rameters, e.g., for a hard-sphere fluid, V0 = (V - N4/3p
2.  In the low-density regime, the ratio 
S0/V0 plainly increases with N. 
 
In  the  high-density  regime,  the  description  of  the  available  volume,  V0, and its surface,  S0, becomes 
more complicated.  At high density, the available volume into which another particle can be injected becomes 
multiply-connected, and the roles of the “free” and “excluded” volumes become interchanged.   At high density 
the  available  volume  becomes  distributed  among  “holes”  in  the  matrix  of  the  excluded  volume.    Reiss17 and 
Hoover et al.45 have named this high-density mode the “Swiss cheese model.”  In such high-density regime, as 
the density is increased the available volume becomes smaller with a consequential decrease in the surface to 
volume ratio  S0/V0.    This  property  suggests  the  presence  of  a  two-phase region.  Previously, this question 
could  be  addressed  only  qualitatively.  Now, the multiply-connected available volume and its surface can be 
analyzed rigorously.  In a paper to follow, the high-density phase stability of the hard-sphere fluid will be de-
scribed explicitly.

Scaled particle theory directly solves the thermodynamic problem of the hard-sphere gas.  The connec-
tion between the scale d particle theory equation for the probability that there exists the center of a particle at dis-
tance r, the spherical volume of which is itself devoid of another particle, equation  (9), and statistical thermody-

Equation (85) is the exact equation from statistical mechanics for a fluid of hard spheres of radius s/2.46 
 
The probability that a particle, of diameter  s, might have its center somewhere within a sphere of radius 
less than  s/2 is simply r (4/3)p r3, because at most only one particle can exist within such sphere.  Therefore, the 
probability  that  the  sphere  has  no  particle  within  it,  P(r), is (1 - r (4/3)p r3).  From the logarithmic derivative of 
P(r) given by equation (8), the solution for the correlation function  G-(r), valid for  r < s/2, obtains directly.  For 
values of the radius greater than s/2, the correlation function G+(r) is assumed to have the form A + B/r + C/r:

The  model  of  the  radial  distribution  function,  G+(r), given by the second of equations  (86) constitutes a 
 
formal assumption for the development of the equation of state for the hard-sphere gas by scaled particle theory.  
However, this assumption is not derived from scaled particle theory, and exists independently of it. 
 
At the radius of the sphere,  r = s/2, both the forms of the correlation function and of its respective first 
derivatives  must  match.    Furthermore,  the  kinetic  pressure  against  any  plane  surface  must  correspond  to  the 
value of the correlation function G+(r) in the limit as r increases without bound: p = k BTr G+(r)|rﬁ

Equation (88) is the scaled particle theory equation of state for a hard-sphere fluid. 
 
The foregoing straightforward development of equation  (10) via the preceding ones above is clearly ex-
act.    The  development  of  Equation  (10)  by  scaled  particle  theory  involves  none  of  the  approximations  of  the 
Born-Green-Yvon  procedure  (BGY),47,  48 and is uncontaminated by the uncertainties of the Hypernetted-Chain-
Approximation  (HNC)49  or  the  Kirkwood  approximations.50,  51  Thus,  scaled  particle  theory  provides  one  of  the 
(very) few exact solutions in statistical mechanics. 
 
 
Appendix C.  Formal development of the description of a chiral hard body, and the separation of the 

chiral and achiral components of the geometric parameters. 

 
The molecular geometric property of chirality often powerfully effects its thermodynamic behavior.  For 
example,  the  thermodynamic  property  that  chiral  molecules  typically  condense  out  of  a  liquid  solution  as  mixed 
crystals, not as solid solutions, was first demonstrated by Pasteur. 
 
Chirality is a tensor property.  The geometric parameters,  R, S, and  V, which describe a hard-body and 
enter  the  Boublík  equation  of  state  appear  (ostensibly)  as  scalar  entities.    The  chiral  properties  of  a  hard-body 
particle  are  described  by  projecting  out  of  the  molecule  two  different  hard-bodies, designated, respectively, the 
chiral  and  achiral  sub-molecules, as defined below.  Each of the geometric parameters,  R, S, and  V, is then de-
scribed by a 1· 2 matrix: 

R

= (cid:231)

, 

and similarly for S. 
The  factors  of  the  geometric  parameters  which  appear  in  the  Boublík  equation  of  state  for mixtures of 
 
hard-body molecules,  (16) or  (18),  involve  bilinear  products  of  R and  S, such as the coefficient of asphericity, 
a = RS/3V.  The bilinear products are defined as the tensorial contraction between the chirality operator,  schiral, 
defined in terms of the two-dimensional identity and first Pauli matrices:

Because the vector space defining the degree of geometric chirality spans two dimensions, only one of the Pauli 
matrices are required;  and the tensor properties of the geometric functionals are described using the symmetric

One  may  observe  simply  that,  using  equation (92) and its analogous bilinear products in the Boublík equation of 
state, gives the identical thermodynamic results for pure-component systems of either L or D chiral enantiomers.  
However, these same equations return additional, different, values for scalemic mixtures of enantiomers, and the 
Boublík equation of state accordingly returns then, for a given pressure and temperature, a different system vol-

The statement “F is identical to ~F” can mean that there exists g ˛

The chiral and achiral components of the surface of exclusion,  S, and its mean exterior curvature, R, are 

ume,  for  which  the difference between such and the volume for the pure-component enantiomers is the excess 
volume. 
 
defined formally as follows. 
 
 
Let ASO(3) denote the full inhomogeneous rotation group of three dimensional Euclidean space, exclud-
ing spatial inversion, and ASO+(3) the group ASO(3) enlarged by including the spatial inversion operation.  (The 
letter “A” stands for affine, which refers to spaces which have no preferred zero point.)  For a solid figure in 3-
space denoted by F, let ~F denote its image under spatial inversion. 
Chiral and achiral figures in 3-space are defined as follows:  A figure in 3-space, F, is achiral if there ex-
 
ists g ˛
 ASO(3) such that g(~F) = F.  That is, the figure derived from inverting F is identical to F after a suitable 
combination of translations and rotations.  A figure, F, in 3-space is chiral if it is not achiral.  That is, F is chiral if 
it has a handedness, so that it is possible to distinguish it from ~F. 
 ASO(3) which maps the point set of 
 
~F onto the point set of F (which is conventional congruence of geometric figures).  Alternately, there exists g ˛
 
ASO(3) such that the mapping  g ~ (inversion followed by g) is the identify on the point set of F.  Therefore g-1 
and ~ map each part of F to the same part of ~F. 
 
Example:    Consider  an  equilateral  tetrahedron,  F,  which  is  an  achiral  figure, in the sense that  the point 
sets of F and ~F are congruent.  Now paint the tetrahedron gray, and paint a small region at each vertex red, yel-
low, green, and blue.  F is now chiral, in the sense that F and ~F cannot be placed in space so that corresponding 
vertices have the same color. 
 
The distinction between equivalence of figures defined by mappings of point-sets and equivalence defined 
by by mappings that preserve corresponding parts is critical in applications to chemical physics.  For example, the 
tetrahedral molecule methane, CH4, is achiral by any definition, whereas the tetrahedral molecule fluorochloroio-
domethane, CHFClI) is achiral when equivalence of figures is defined by mappings that preserve corresponding 
parts, that is, by mappings that send H to H, F to F, Cl  to Cl and I to I.  (CHFClI is also chiral when equivalence 
of figures is defined by point set congruence, but only because the ions have different sizes.) 
 
Henceforth in this paper, equivalence of molecules is defined by mappings that send each radical to  an-
other  radical  of  the  same  type.    This  situation  can  be  represented  by  giving  identical  atoms  and  ions  the  same 
color, and different atoms and ions different colors, and defining equivalence by mappings that preserve colors of 
atoms and ions. 
  
 
Definition of an achiral sub-molecule:  Given a molecule M, a subset of the radicals in the molecule is an 
achiral sub-molecule if it is an achiral figure, where equivalence is defined so that radicals of the same type are 
preserved under equivalence. 
 
Definition: Maximal achiral sub-molecule:  Given a molecule M, an achiral sub-molecule is maximal if no 
other radical of M can be appended to it to yield a larger achiral sub-molecule.  An alternate definition could be:  
The achiral core of a molecule M is the intersection of the maximal achiral sub-molecules of M.  The chiral re-
mainder of a molecule M is defined as the complement of the achiral core of M. 
 
Example:    For  methane,  the  maximal  achiral  core  is  the  entire  molecule.    For  CHFClI,  the  maximal 
achiral sub-molecules are the carbon plus any two of the “limbs” of the molecule. These sub-molecules are maxi-
mal because appending any three of the “limbs” to the carbon results in a chiral molecule. The maximal achiral 
core  of  the  molecule  is  the  carbon  radical.  The  chiral remainder is the set of radicals {F, Cl, I}, which is not a 
contiguous molecular segment. 
  
 
The chiral and achiral components of the geometric parameters  R, S and  V, of the achiral core and the 
chiral remainder of a molecule, which enter the components of the 1· 2 matrices indicated by equation  (89) are, 

page 29 

respectively, defined using differential geometry as follows:  The surface parameters, S, of the achiral core and of 
the chiral remainder are both defined as the surface integrals of the two respective parts, but excluding the new 
surfaces that result from the separation of the two parts. 
 
The mean exterior curvature  R of the achiral core and of the chiral remainder are defined, respectively, 
as the surface integrals of the mean extrinsic curvature over the surfaces of the two parts, but excluding the new 
surfaces that result from the separation of the two parts.  If the seams between the achiral core and the chiral 
remainder contain any discrete exterior angles (where the surface has a discrete bend), then these discrete exte-
rior angles contribute to the  R of the total figure, and a rule would be required for assigning part of this contribu-
tion to the achiral core and part to the chiral remainder. However, the surfaces of real molecules do not have any 
discrete bends. 
 
each point set. 
 
 
These chiral and achiral components of the geometric parameters R, S and V, were developed for convex 
hard-body molecules using the cumbersome procedure of Kihara for the analysis of the phenomenon of optical 
activity in abiotic fluids.12  In this present case, for which differential geometry has been used, there is no restric-
tion to convex hard-body molecules. 
 

The parameter  V of both the achiral core and of the chiral remainder is trivially defined as the volume of

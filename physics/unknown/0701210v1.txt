Abstract 

We present a new family of diffractive lenses whose structure is based on the combination 
of two concepts: photon sieve and fractal zone plates with variable lacunarity. The focusing 
properties  of  different  members  of  this  family  are  examined.  It  is  shown  that  the  sieves 
provide  a  smoothing  effect  on  the  higher  order  foci  of  a  conventional  lacunar  fractal  zone 
plate.  However,  the  characteristic  self-similar  axial  response  of  the  fractal  zone  plates  is 
always preserved.

1. Introduction 

Diffractive focusing elements are most beneficial in many applications where they can 
perform tasks that are difficult, or even impossible, with conventional refractive optics [1]. In 
fact,  during  the  last  years,  they  are  becoming  key  elements  in  obtaining  images  in  several 
scientific  and  technological  areas  such  as,  THz  tomography,  astronomy  and  soft  X-ray 
microscopy  [2-5].  Aside  from  conventional  Fresnel  zone  plates,  other  geometries  of  2D 
photonic-image-forming  structures  have  been  proposed.  One  of  them  is  generally  known  as 
fractal zone plate (FZP) [6, 7]. A FZP is characterized by its fractal profile along the square of 
the radial coordinate. When illuminated by a parallel wavefront a FZP produce multiple foci, 
the  main  lobe  of  which  coincide  with  those  of  the  associated  conventional  zone  plate 
(actually, under certain circumstances, a FZP can be thought as a conventional zone plate with 
certain missing zones), but he internal structure of each focus exhibits a characteristic fractal 
structure,  reproducing  the  self-similarity  of  the  originating  FZP.  It  has  been  shown  that  the 
number  of  foci  and  their  relative  amplitude  can be  modified  with  the  lacunarity  of  the  FZP 
[7]. This design parameter is frequently used as a measure of the “texture” of fractal structures 
[8-11].  

Photon  sieves  [12]  are  another  kind  of  diffractive  optical  elements,  developed  for 
focusing  and  imaging  soft  X  rays  with  high  resolution  capabilities.  A  conventional  photon 
sieve is essentially a Fresnel zone plate where the clear zones are replaced by great number of

non overlapping holes of different sizes. Several theoretical and experimental works related to 
photon sieves have been performed, explaining their properties from different points of view 
[13, 14] and showing their good performance in different applications [15, 16]. Following this 
trend, our group has recently introduced the fractal photon sieve (FPS) [17] which essentially 
is  a  FZP  in  which  the  clear  zones  have  been  replaced  by  a  non  overlapping  distribution  of 
circular holes.  

The original proposal for FPS was based on the triadic regular Cantor fractal set [17]. In 
this  paper  we  propose  a  more  general  structure  introducing  the  lacunarity  as  a  new  design 
parameter. We coined this new family of diffractive structures: Lacunar Fractal Photon Sieves 
(LFPS). Some practical considerations abut the design of this general type of photon sieves 
are investigated, taking into account the physical limits imposed by the different construction 
parameters.  The  impact  on  the  axial  irradiance  produced  by  the  combination  of  sieves  and 
lacunar FZP is compared with the response of the equivalent continuous lacunar FZP. 

 

2. Lacunar fractal photon sieve design 

The  construction  of  a  typical  polyadic  Cantor  fractal  set  with  a  specific  lacunarity  is 
shown in Fig. 1. The first step in the construction procedure consists in defining a straight-line 
segment of unit length called initiator (stage S=0). Next, at stage S=1, the generator of the set 
is constructed by N (N=4 in the figure) non-overlapping copies of the initiator each one with a 
scale γ<1. At the following stages of construction of the set (S=2,3,...), the generation process 
is repeated over and over again for each segment in the previous stage.  

To characterize the resulting Cantor set, as well as many other fractal structures, one of 

the most frequently-used descriptors is the fractal dimension, defined as 

D

= −

ln(

N

) / ln( )
γ

. 

However, this parameter does not uniquely define the fractal. In fact, for the general case, it is 
necessary to introduce another parameter to specify the distribution of the N copies into the 
unit length segment. This parameter specifies the lacunarity of the resulting structure and it is 
necessary  to  complete  the  characterization  of  the  fractal  since  structures  with  different 
lacunarity can have the same fractal dimension. To define the lacunarity, we use the width of 
outermost  gap  in  the  first  stage  (see  Fig.  1).  This  convention  was  also  adopted  in  some 
previous papers dealing with Cantor fractals [7, 8, 9]. It has been shown that regular fractal is 
a particular case of this general structure when the lacunarity ε, takes the following value

this is equivalent to impose that the bars and gaps have the same size at the initiator stage. 

Assuming that the fractal structure of Fig. 1 can be mathematically represented by a 
one  dimensional  binary  function  q(ς)  defined  in  the  interval  [0,1],  lacunar  FZPs  can  be 
generated by performing a change of coordinates ς=(r/a)2 and by rotating the transformed 1-D 
function around one of its extremes. The result is a zone plate having a radial coordinate r and 
an outermost ring of radius a [see Fig. 2(a)]. The LFPS here proposed has essentially the same 
structure of a lacunar FZP but instead of transparent rings the corresponding zones have been 
broken  up  into  isolated  circular  holes  randomly  distributed  (a  photon  sieve).  The  result  is 
shown in Fig. 2(b).  

In the construction procedure we adopted the results reported in Ref [12] where it has 
been  shown  that  for  a  photon  sieve  constructed  with  a  Fresnel  zone  plate  structure,  the 
diameter  d  of  the  holes  in  each  ring  of  width  w  of  has  an  optimum  value  for  the  effective 
contribution to the focus. This value is given by d=1.53w. The number of holes in the LFPS 
shown in Fig. 2(b) is 2357 and the density of holes per zone, i.e., the ratio between the area 
covered  by  the  holes  and  the  total  area  of  the  zone,  is  approximately  90%.  The  minimum 
diameter, d, in the outermost ring is given by d/a=0.0078.

3. Axial Irradiance provided by LFPS 

To investigate the axial focusing properties of a typical LFPS let us start by considering 
the  irradiance  along  the  optical  axis,  z,  provided  by  an  optical  system  having  a    2D  pupil 
p r φ  (expressed in canonical polar coordinates) when it is illuminated by a plane

The  axial  irradiance  in  Eq.  (3)  can  be  conveniently  expressed  in  terms  of  a  single  radial 
integral, by performing first the azimuthal average of the pupil function ( , )

To compare the performance of a LFPS with the associated lacunar FZP we used Eq. 
(5) to compute the axial irradiances provided by the pupil functions represented in Figs. 2(a) 
and  2(b).  The  result  is  shown  in  Fig.  3  together  with  the  irradiances  corresponding  to 
analogous  pupils  constructed  for  S=1.  In  order  to  observe  the  fractal  behavior  of  the 
irradiances for different stages of growth S, we have normalized the axial distance, z, to the 
principal focal length given by

The self-similarity of the resulting axial irradiances can be clearly seen in Fig. 3(a). The 
dotted lines (S=1) forms the envelope of the solid lines (S=2). On the other hand, when the 
lacunar FZP is replaced by a LFPS the principal focus remains almost unaltered but all odd 
higher  orders  are  highly  reduced  due  to  the  smoothing  effect  that  the  holes  produce  on  the 
azimuthal  average  of  the  effective  pupil.  This  effect  is  obtained  at  the  expense  of  the 
appearance of low intensity even orders, which by design are null in the case of azimuthally 
uniform FZP with ε=εR. 

To  show  that  the  self-similar  behavior  provided  by  LFPS  is  retained  even  when  the 
lacunarity parameter is varied, we have used twist plots [9] may be used. These plots represent 
the  axial  irradiance  is  represented  as  a  function  of  the  normalized  axial  distance  and  the 
lacunarity parameter ε. Figure 4 shows twist plots for tetraedic (N=4) LFPS S=1 (a) and S=2 
(b). In these plots a linear gray level scale was used for the normalized axial irradiance.  

The most noticeable feature of Fig. 4 is the self-similarity that can be observed between 
the  plots  corresponding  to  S=1  and  S=2.  In  effect,  the  rescaled  data  at  stage  S=1  forms  an 
envelope for the data at S=2, and both structures are self-similar for any value of ε. This result 
shows that the axial irradiance provided by polyadic LFPS has self-similar properties like to 
those  reported  for  lacunar  FZP  [7].  However, from  the  focalization  point  of  view  LFPS  are 
more  efficient  than  lacunar  FZP  because  the  relative  intensity  of  the  main  focus  is  much 
higher than the secondary foci. To show more clearly this feature we represented the data in 
Fig. 4(b) for S=2 but in a 3D plot shown in Fig. 5 (bottom). In the upper part of this figure, the 
irradiance provided by an equivalent lacunar FZP is shown for comparison. The reduction of 
the secondary foci is significant for any value of the parameter ε, however the structure of the 
principal focus remain almost unaltered.

4. Conclusions 

Fractal  photon  sieves  with  variable  lacunarity  have  been  proposed.  The  focusing 
properties  of  LFPSs  have  been  numerically  evaluated.  As  this  new  kind  of  zone  plates  are 
based on lacunar FZP, they have a principal focus with almost the same structure. However, 
since  the  azimuthal  average  governs  the  behaviour  of  the  axial  irradiance,  a  LFPS  can  be 
designed  to  achieve  any  convenient  apodization  by  a  proper  modulation  of  the  density  of 
pinholes  in  each  zone.  It  was  shown  that  the  lacunarity  has  a  dramatic  effect  on  the  axial 
irradiance provided the LFPS, although the apodization of the higher order foci and the self-
similarity of the principal focus are always preserved.  

Since  from  a  structural  point  of  view,  the  LFPSs  can  be  constructed  without  any 
supporting substrate, they can be also employed as a versatile focusing device in other regions 
of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum,  such  as  microwaves  and  X  rays  and  even  with  slow 
neutrons, in which graded amplitude pupils are difficult or even impossible to construct.

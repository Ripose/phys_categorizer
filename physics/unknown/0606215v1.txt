Abstract.  In  the  context  of  computer  assist  surgical  tech-
niques, a new elastic registration method of 3D meshes is pre-
sented.  In  our  applications,  one  mesh  is  a  high  density  mesh
(30000  vertexes),  the  second  is  a  low  density  one  (1000  ver-
texes). Registration is based upon the minimisation of a sym-
metric distance between both meshes, defined on the vertexes,
in a multi resolution approach. Results on synthetic images are
first presented. Then, thanks to this registration method, a sta-
tistical  model  of  the  skull  is  build  from  Computer  Tomogra-
phy exams collected for twelve patients.

1   Introduction

Medical  Imaging  and  computer  assisted  surgical  techniques  may  im-
prove  current  maxillo-facial  surgical  protocol  as  an  aid  in  diagnostic,
planning and surgical  procedure  [1].  The  steps  of  a  complete  assisted
protocol  may  be  summarized  as  :  (1)  Morphological  data  acquisition,
including  3D  imaging  computed  from  Computer  Tomography  (CT)
scanner, (2) Data integration which requires a 3D cephalometry analy-
sis, (3) Surgical planning , (4) Surgical simulation for bone osteotomy
and  prediction  of  facial  soft  tissue  deformation,  (5)  Per  operative  as-
sistance for respecting surgical planning.
Three-dimensional  cephalometric  analysis,  being  essential  for  clinical
use  of  computer  aided  techniques  in  maxillofacial,  are  currently  in
development [2,3,4].In most methods, the main drawback is  the  man-
ual  location  of  the  points  used  to  build  the  maxillofacial  framework.
The relationship between the cephalometry and the whole scans data is

flawed by the amount of data and the variability of the exams. A com-
mon hypothesis is a virtual link between a low dimension model of the
skull and these points.
We choose to first construct a statistical model of the skull, which will
be link to a cephalometrics points model. This paper first presents data
acquisition. In a second part, registration is described. Then, results on
synthetic  images  are  discussed  and  the  construction  of  a  statistical
skull model is presented.

2   Method

The literature treating registration methods is very extensive (e.g., [5]
for a survey). On one side are geometry based registration, which used
a  few  selected  points  or  features,  where  Iterative  Closest  Point  and
Active Shape Model are two classical approaches [6]. The main draw-
back of most of these methods is the need for the  manual  location  of
the  landmarks  used  to  drive  the  correspondence  between  objects  in
advance. On  the  other  side  are  intensity-based  algorithms,  which  use
most of the intensity information in both data set [7].

2.1   Data Acquisition and 3D Reconstruction of the Patient’s Skull

Coronal  CT  slices  were  collected  for  the  partial  skulls  of  12  patients
(helical  scan  with  a  1-mm  pitch  and  slices  reconstructed  every  0.31
mm  or  0.48  mm).  The  Marching  Cubes  algorithm  has  been  imple-
mented  to  reconstruct  the  skull  from  CT  slices  on  isosurfaces.  The
mandible  and  the  skull  are  separated  before  the  beginning  of  the
matching  process,  our  patients  having  different  mandible  relative  po-
sition. (Figure 1, left panel).
In order to construct the statistical skull model, we need to register all
the  high  density  /  low  density  meshes  in  a  patient-shared  reference
system [8]. In this system, the triangles for a region of the skull are the
same for all patients, the variability of the position of the vertexes will
figurate the specificity of each density mesh in a patient. The vertex of
these shared mesh  can  be  considered  as  semilandmarks,  i.e.  as  points
that  do  not  have  names  but  that  correspond  across  all  the  cases  of  a
data set under a reasonable model  of  deformation  from  their  common
mean [9,10].
This  shared  mesh  was  not  obtained  with  a  decimation  algorithm.  Be-
cause  our  goal  is  to  predict  anatomical  landmarks  (some  of  cephalo-
metric points) from the statistical skull model, we choose not to use  a
landmark  based  deformation  [as  in  11]  but  a  method  that  does  not
require  specification  of  corresponding  features.  The  low  definition

model  (Figure  1,  right  panel)  was  therefore  taken  from  the  Visible
Woman Project.

2.2  Shaping a generic model to patient-specific data  :  3D  Meshes
registration

The deformation of a high definition 3D surface towards a low defini-
tion  3D  surface  is  obtained  by  an  original  3D-to-3D  matching  algo-
rithm.

2.2.1 3D to 3D matching

The basic principle of the 3D-to-3D matching procedure developed by
Lavallée and colleagues [12] consists basically in deforming the initial
3D space by a series of trilinear transformations applied to elementary
cubes (see also figure 2 ) :

The  elementary  cubes  are  determined  by  iteratively  subdividing  the
input  space  in  a  multi  resolution  scheme  (see  figure  3)  in  order  to
minimize the distance between the 3D surfaces:

where  S  is  the  surface  to  be  adjusted  to  the  set  of  points  q,  p  the  pa-
rameters  of  the  transformation  T  (initial  rototranslation  of  the  refer-
ence coordinates system and further a set of trilinear transformations).
P(p)  is  a  regularization  function  that  guaranties  the  continuity  of  the
transformations  at  the  limits  of  each  subdivision  of  the  3D  space  and
that  authorizes  larger  deformations  for  smaller  subdivisions.  The
minimization  is  performed  using  the  Levenberg-Marquardt  algorithm
[13].

matched  cone  using  the  single  distance  method  (centre);  matched  cone

In  some  cases,  the  transformed  surface  is  well-matched  to  the  closest
surface  but  the  correspondence  between  the  two  surfaces  is  false  [see
figure  4].  This  mismatching  can  be  explained  by  the  two  distances
between each surfaces,  which  are  not  equivalent  due  to  the  difference
of density between the two meshes. In this case, the distance from the
source  to  the  target  (expressed  in  the  minimization  function)  is  very

low whereas the distance from the target to the source is important (see
Table 1).
We therefore included the two  distances  in  the  minimization  function
as in [14] :

To compute the distance between the target and the source, the closest
points of the low density vertexes towards the high density (points qi in
equation 2) are stored. Bar(rs) is the barycentre of this set of points  in
the  distance  between  the  high  density  mesh  (target)  and  the  low  den-
sity mesh (source).

3 Results

3.1 Synthetic images

We first try these two methods on a set of four forms obtained with the
same procedure. Each form is generated with two levels of density (low
and  high)  before  or  after  decimation.  The  following  table  show  the
benefits of the “symmetric distance”  method  for  these  8  objects,  com-
pared to the “single distance” method.

Table  2  summarises  results  :  The  method  is  well  suited  for  shapes  of
same  topology.  But  different  topologies  are  not  registered:  a  sphere
deformed  to  the  open  ring  shape  will  not  capture  the  aperture  of  the
ring, and a cone will “flat” himself in the centre of the ring.

3.2 Real Data : Mandible Meshes

The low density mandible meshes are generated using the “symmetric
distance” method.  The  single  distance  approach  leads  to  many  mi s-
matches in the condyle and goniac angle regions (figure 5).
The  maximal  distances  are  located  on  the  teeth  (which  will  not  be
included  in  the  model,  but  are  used  for  correspondences  during  the
registration) and in the coronoid regions.
The mean distances can be considered as the registration noise, due to
the difference of density (see Table 3).

3.3 Application :  Skull Statistical Model

12 CT patient’s scans with different pathologies are used. Half of them
suffer from sinus pathologies, while the other half suffer  from  pathol-
ogy of the orbits. The CT scans are centred around the pathology  and
do  not  include  (except  for  one  patient)  the  skull  vault.  The  patients
have different mandible positions, so the skull and the  mandible  were
registered separately.
After  jointing  these  two  parts  of  our  model,  they  are  aligned  using
Procrustes registration on the mean individual, as the statistical shape
model must be independent from the rigid transformations (translation,
rotation).  Gravity  centres  are  first  aligned.  Then  the  optimal  rotation
that minimizes the distance between the two set of points is obtained.
The statistical model can only have 12 degrees-of-freedom (DOF), for
a set of 3938 points (potentially 11814 geometrical DOF), as the num-
ber of DOF is limited by the number of patients. Using a simple statis-
tical  analysis,  we  show  that  95%  of  the  variance  of  the  data  can  be
explained  with  only  5  parameters  (see  Table  4).  These  “shape” p a-
rameters are linear and additive :

where  M  is  the  mean  shape,  A  the  “shape” vector,  and    a
coefficients.

4 Conclusion

In  this  paper,  a  new  registration  approach  for  3D  meshes  has  been
presented.  In  our  application,  one  mesh  is  a  high  density  mesh,  the
second  a  low  density  one.  To  enhance  the  registration,  a  symmetric
distance has been proposed in a multi resolution approach. Results on
synthetic and real images exhibit good qualitative performances.  This
method is then used to elaborate a statistical skull model.

Abstract 

 
SPEED2 is a generator based on Marx technology and was designed in the University of Düsseldorf. SPEED2 
consists on 40 +/- Marx modules connected in parallel (4.1 m F equivalent Marx generator capacity, 300 kV, 4 
MA  in  short  circuit,  187  kJ,  400  ns  rise  time,  dI/dt~ 1013  A/s).  Currently  the  SPEED2  is  operating  at  the 
Comisión Chilena de Energía Nuclear, CCHEN, Chile, being the most powerful and energetic device for dense 
transient plasma in the Southern Hemisphere. Most of the previous works developed in SPEED2 at Düsseldorf 
were done in a plasma focus configuration for soft X-ray emission and the neutron emission from SPEED2 was 
not completely studied. The research program at CCHEN considers experiments in different pinch configurations 
(plasma  focus,  gas  puffed  plasma  focus,  gas  embedded  Z-pinch,  wire  arrays)  at  current  of  hundred  of 
kiloamperes to mega-amperes, using the SPEED2 generator. The Chilean operation has begun implementing and 
developing  diagnostics  in  a  conventional  plasma  focus  configuration  operating  in  deuterium  in  order  to 
characterize the neutron emission and the hard X-ray production. Silver activation counters, plastics CR39 and 
scintillator-photomultiplier  detectors  are  used  to  characterize  the  neutron  emission.  Images  of  metallic  plates 
with  different  thickness  are  obtained  on  commercial  radiographic  film,  Agfa  Curix  ST-G2,  in  order  to 
characterize an effective energy of the hard X-ray outside of the discharge .  

Introduction  

 

 
SPEED2 is a generator based on Marx technology and was designed in the University of 
Düsseldorf. SPEED2 consists on 40 +/- Marx modules connected in parallel. Each module has 
6 capacitors (50kV, 0.625 m F, 20nH) and 3 sparkgaps, so the pulse power generator SPEED2 
is a medium energy and large current device (4.1 m F equivalent Marx generator capacity, 300 
kV, 4 MA in short circuit, 187 kJ, 400 ns rise time, dI/dt~ 1013 A/s) [2]. The SPEED2 arrived 
at  the  Comisión  Chilena  de  Energía  Nuclear,  CCHEN,  in  May  2001  from  Düsseldorf 
University, Germany, and it is in operation since January 2002, being the most powerful and 
energetic  device  for  dense  transient  plasma  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere.  The  research 
program  at  CCHEN  considers  experiments  in  different  pinch  configurations  (plasma  focus, 
gas  puffed  plasma  focus,  gas  embedded  Z-pinch,  wire  arrays)  at  current  of  hundred  of 
kiloamperes to mega-amperes, using the SPEED2 generator [1]. 

 
In  this  paper  a  series  of  preliminary  experimental  results  of  the  hard  X-ray  energy 
measurements in a plasma focus driven by SPEED2 are presented . Also some results related to 
neutron emission are shown. Operating in the plasma focus (PF) configuration, the pulse power 
generator  SPEED2  have  a  maximum  charging  voltage  of  300  kV  [1],  but  for  the  actual 
measurements a 75 % of  its 6 stage Marx generator was used to provide a charging voltage of 
180 kV through the capacitor bank of 3.1 m F and to store an equivalent energy of 50.22 kJ. Using 
Deuterium like filling gas the working gas pressure was between 2.1 and 5 mbar. 

 
Most of the previous works developed in SPEED2 at Düsseldorf were done in a plasma 
focus configuration for soft X-ray emission and the neutron emission and hard X-ray emission 
from SPEED2 were not completely studied.  

 

 

 

The  neutron  emission  studies  in  plasma  focus  configuration  include  a)  the 
characterization of the total yield vs pressure and vs peak current, b) angular distribution and 
mechanisms  of  neutron  emission  (thermonuclear  and  beam  target),  and  c)  the  possibility  to 
enhance  the  thermonuclear  component  of  the  neutron  yield  against  the  beam  target 
component.  SPEED2  use  a  special  insulator,  quartz  covered  with  alumina,  and  it  requires 
several  shots  to  perform  an  appropriate  neutron  emission  whose  neutron  yield  dispersion 
between shots be lower than 30 %. We have not enough shots with the same insulator in order to 
achieve the proper operating conditions. Preliminary results obtained at CCHEN show a neutron 
yield of the order of 1010 neutrons per shot, the maximum value obtained up to now at CCHEN is 
2x1010 neutrons per shot. In Düsseldorf, a neutron yield of the order of 1011-1012 neutrons per shot 
was obtained [3]. Time resolution neutron detection and plastics CR39 nuclear track detectors in  
several  angles  are  now  being  implemented.  In  the  reference  [5]  it  is  reported  time  integrated 
measurements  of  the  neutron  emission  from  -900  to  900  including  9  angles  of  view  in  two 
plasma  focus  devices.  The  neutron  flux  was  measured  with  CR-39  nuclear  track  detectors 
covered  with  polyethylene.  The  results  are  consistent  with  an  angular  uniform  plateau 
(isotropic  emission)  plus  a  shape  peaked  in  the  direction  of  the  axis  of  the  discharge 
(anisotropic emission). Using this analysis the authors obtain an interesting result,  the 70% of 
the total neutron emission is isotropic and only the 30% is anisotropic, because to the axial 
emission is concentrated only in a small solid angle, thus its contribution to the total emission 
is  lower  in  comparison  to  the  isotropic  emission.  The  value  usually  reported,  as  the  ratio 
between only to point of measured, axial and radial, may be misleading.  

  

In  principle,  X-rays  are  generated  in  the  PF  devices  by  Bremmstrahlung  from  the  thermal 
electrons; by line emission from high Z ions (if present because they form the filling gas or either 
as  impurities);  and  by  high  energy  electron  beams  (hundreds  of  keV)  colliding  with  the  anode. 
The first two contributions are in the range of 1 to a few tens of keV (soft X-rays) while the last 
one lies in the range of hundred of keV (hard X-rays), which help to study them separately (fig. 
1). In spite of several experimental and theoretical studies of the X-rays emitted by PF devices, 
their generation and temporal and spatial evolution need more clarification. 

 
The  image  of  metallic  plates,  of  different  thickness,  in  radiographic  films  was  used  like 
diagnostic  tool.  The  statistical  study  of  the  digitised  image  intensities  allow  us  to  obtain  a 
preliminary  energy  characterization  of  the  emitted  X-rays  from  the  SPEED2.  Considering  the 
classical exponential radiation decay relation through the matter, I(x)/I0 = exp (-k·x), is possible to 
obtain  the  effective  linear  mass  attenuation  coefficient  (k)  when  different  gray  shades  of  the 
digitised  images  are  linked  with  the  I(x)/I0  rate.  This  method  of  image  analysis,  developed  by 
Raspa [4], allows to obtain a correlation between k, through the mass absorption coefficient, and 
the X-ray energy [6]. 
 
Experimental Setup and Results 
 
The scheme of the experimental setup is showed at figure 1. The plasma focus device has a 
cathode and anode length of ≤ 120 mm and 80 mm respectively, and the external and internal 
electrode  radius  of  110  mm  y  54  mm  respectively.  The  insulator  length  is  65  mm  with  an 
external radius of 60 mm. Commercial radiographic films, Agfa Curix ST-G2, in an AGFA 
CURIX Ortho Regular chassis with an intensified screen, were installed in the discharge axis 
(A and B in fig. 1), outside the discharge chamber. The A film was at 45.5 to 97.5 cm from 
the anode basis, meanwhile the B film was over the range of 100 and 156 cm from the anode 
top  (fig.  1).  A  Lead  target,  2.0  mm  thickness,  was  installed  in  the  anode  basis  in  order  to 
sensibility  increase  the  efficiency  of  the  colliding  electrons  the  X-ray  energy  in  the  anode 
basis [2].

Figure 2 shows the typical digital computer image of a radiographic film obtained after an 
effective  shot.  An  example  of  the  intensity  profile  graphic  of  the  different  elements  are 
showed at figure 3. The intensity profile graphic of the Lead (fig. 3a) allows to discriminate 
those  images  that  are  useful  to  determine  the  X-ray  energy.  In  fact,  the  threshold  of  “non-
irradiation”  is  verified  by  the  Lead  intensity  level,  that  should  be  equal  for  the  different 
existing arrangements (Pb(1) and Pb(2) in Table 1). However a good image contrast is also 
required for to determine the k values of the different involved metals. The adequate profile

contrast is verified when a nice stepped curve is obtained for the intensity profile graphic of 
each element, an example is showed at figure 3b.

The radiographic films were scanned (200 dpi resolution) and each time the Lead intensity 
profile  graphic  (fig.  3a)  was  obtained  allowing  to  know  its  mean  linear  mass  attenuation 
coefficient  (k).  The  k  value  obtained  is  used  like  “non-irradiation”  k  reference  for  the

giving a percentage error (D ki/ki) of  3.85 % in the best case and 7.15 % in the worst one.  

 

 

 

 

The  same  procedure  is  used  to  obtain  the linear mass attenuation coefficient against the 
thickness of the respective element. So, with this determined parameters is possible to obtain 
a graphic like is showed at figure 4. Each metallic element, images on the A and B films, have 
its  proper  I(x)/I0  against  its  respective  thickness.  Also  a  linear  fit  through  the  data  points 
allows  to  get,  for  each  element,  a  k  value  but  obtained  this  time  from  the  slope  with  a 
percentage error ranged between 1.76 % and 15.39 %. So, at this stage we have a calculate 
mean  value  of  k  for  each  metallic  element  and  a  k  value  coming  from  the  slope  of  the 
respective graphic like is showed at figure 4. 

  
Relating the linear mass attenuation coefficient of each element with its respective mass 
attenuation coefficient [3], we obtain the value of the hard X-ray characteristic energy which 
impress the films after each shot. Table 2 briefly show the obtained results:

The first column identify an individual shot, the film A or B can be identify because the last 
algorithm  in  the  shot  name  is  A  or  B.  These  selected  shot  are  those  that  approved  the  intensity 
profile test early described (fig.3). The respective <E> columns give us the mean value of the X-
ray energy for each shot. Only the shot 230704-08, the higher energy shot, was possible to analyse 
the film A and B; for the other ones it was impossible to analyse because a very bad contrast or a 
weak A (or a and B) film impression. It possible to observe, from the Table 2 in the case of the 
last shot, that it was impossible to determine the energy for the copper; surely this element was 
transparent for the ¨ 144 keV energy of X-ray which arrived on the films. 

 
The  energy  of  the  hard  X-rays,  for  each  shot,  was  obtained  independently  analysing  the 
impressed  images.  The  energy  dispersion  has  a  reasonable  value  (D E/E  £

Abstract 

We report the use of an optical interference holographic setup with a five-beam configuration, 

consisting  of  four  side  beams  and  one  central  beam  from  the  same  half  space,  to  fabricate 

woodpile  and  diamond  structures  for  the  use  as  photonic  bandgap  materials  in  which 

electromagnetic  waves  are  forbidden  in  the  bandgap.      By  exploiting  the  advantage  of  the 

binarization of the interference pattern, using intensity cut-off, either linear or circular central 

beam  can  be  used.    More  importantly,  the  beam  configurations  can  be  easily  implemented 

experimentally as compared to other configurations in which the interfering beams are counter-

propagating from both half spaces. 

Keywords: photonic crystals, woodpile and diamond structures, holography

Photonic crystals are dielectric materials that exhibit photonic bandgaps in which EM wave 

propagation  in  the  bandgaps  is  forbidden,  analogous  to  electronic  bandgaps  in  semi-

conductors.[1]  They  hold  the  promises  for  the  next  generation  advances  in  science  and 

technology, the same as what semi-conductors had done in the past few decades.  The design 

and fabrication of photonic crystals exhibiting complete bandgaps have been challenging, and 

thus have attracted wide interest.[1,2]  Among the various micro-structures, the diamond and its 

hybrid  woodpile  structures  stand  out  with  wide  and  complete  bandgaps  even  with  moderate 

dielectric  contrast.[2]    To  fabricate  the  photonic  crystals,  methods  like  the  self-assembly  or 

nano-manipulation of colloidal micro-spheres,[3,4] the layer by layer micro-fabrications,[5] and 

recently, the holographic lithography[6-8] and the multi-photon direct laser writing,[9]  have been 

commonly  used.    However,  not  all  of  the  above  methods  are  suitable  for  fabricating  the 

diamond  structure.    For  example,  the  self-assembly  method  is  limited  to  face-centered-cubic 

(FCC) or close-packed structures.[3]  Recently, micro-manipulation has been used to fabricate 

the diamond structure.[4]   However, the sample size is limited to a few unit cells and is very 

time consuming.  The layer by layer and the multi-photon direct laser writing techniques had 

been  used  to  fabricate  the  woodpile  structure  with  bandgaps  in  the  infrared  range.[5,9]  

However, they are limited to a few layers due to the demanding precision and procedures.[5,9]  

The  holographic  lithography,  a  method  combining  the  techniques  of  multiple-beam 

interference and the photolithography to record the interference pattern in photoresist, provides 

some  advantages  over  the  above  methods.    It  requires  only  simple  experimental  setups  and 

various structures (e.g. quasi-periodic [7] and chiral structures [8]) are feasible by different beam 

orientations  and  polarizations.    This  method  has  thus  attracted  much  interest  since  the 

realization  of  the  FCC  structure  using  a  4-beam  interference.[6]    Furthermore,  a  double-

exposure  had  also  been  used  to  fabricate  the  woodpile  structure  in  the  infrared  range.[10]   

Recently, several groups have suggested that some modifications of the 4-beam configuration 

for the FCC structure could be used to fabricate the diamond structure.[11-14]  However, these 

 

2

configurations  require  either  impractical  beam  arrangements  with  the  interfering  beams 

counter-propagating from both half spaces or elliptical polarizations that are hard to implement 

experimentally.[11-15]  A recent attempt to fabricate the diamond structure using a (3+1)-beam 

configuration  (3  linear  polarized  side  beams  and  one  circular  polarized)  is  however 

questionable.[16]   In this report, we propose a 5-beam configuration to fabricate the woodpile 

and diamond structures.  The configuration is basically the “umbrella” arrangement with 4 side 

beams  arranged  symmetrically  around  a  central  beam.[6]  More  importantly,  all  the  beams  are 

from the same half space making it easy to implement experimentally.  The angle between the 

side beams with the central beam determines the rod shape in the woodpile structure and can 

be chosen, with proper beam polarizations and by exploiting the advantage of the binarization 

using intensity cut-off,[12] to give the diamond structure.  Furthermore, the central beam can be 

linear  or  circular  polarized.    Our  configurations  can  be  achieved  using  standard  holographic 

setups, leading to possible realization of the diamond structure in the visible range.

To fabricate the woodpile structure, we need rods in both the x- and y-directions stacked 

alternately with one “rod-space” shift in each plane.  This can be done by the interference of

 chosen 

from  symmetry  considerations.    Note  that  in  general  the  rods  are  elliptical.    Furthermore,  in 

order to form the woodpile structure, the y-rods in Fig. 1(c) are shifted one “rod-space” from 

the x-rods along the z-axis in Fig. 1(b).  This is done by adding a 180

o phase to one of the size 

beam  as  indicated  in  the  polarizations  used  for  Figs.  1(a)  and  (b).    Figure  1(d)  shows  a

woodpile  structure  obtained  from the  interference  of  all  5  beams in  Fig.  1(a)  using  the  same 

parameters as in Figs. 1(b)-(c).  For ϕ = 70.53o and 

}{ iω  used in Figs.1(b)-(d), Eq. (4) can be 

reduced, dropping the constant term, to

.[11-12]   Figures 1(e) and (f) show 

clearly the diamond structure in unit cell for 95% and 86% intensity cut-offs, respectively.  For 

the 86% cut-off, the contour surfaces are interconnected, a condition needed for self-supporting 

in  the  holographic  lithography  fabrication.    Despite  the  “non-diamond”  terms,  they  look 

remarkably the same as those reported earlier.[11-12]  This is partly because the “non-diamond” 

terms  (Fig.  1(g))  is  small  compared  to  the  diamond  terms  (Fig.  1(h))  so  that  a  high  enough 

intensity cut-off would diminish the effect of the “non-diamond” terms; and also the fact that 

the  “non-diamond”  terms  have  the  horizontal  symmetry  of  the  diamond  structure  such  that 

these  terms  will  not  work  “against”  the  diamond  structure.    This  is  a  good  example  to 

demonstrate  the  advantage  of  the  holographic  lithography  in  the  fabrication  of  photonic 

crystals  because  it  is  more  tolerable  to  non-ideal  beam  configurations  by  using  intensity 

binarization. 

 

In principle, the “non-diamond” cross terms in Eq. 4 can be eliminated by suitable choices 

of the polarizations for the 5 beams. For ϕ = 70.53o, we find one solution by imposing ω0  = 

45o, ω1  = ω3  + π, and ω2  = ω4  = π − ω1, giving ω3 = 

arctan(

)97

 = 41.41o, ω1 = 221.41o, and 

ω2 = ω4 = −41.41o.  With these polarizations, Eq. 4 can be reduced to

Column 3 of Table I give the polarizations and the intensity distributions for Eq. 5(b).  Now, 

after a 45o rotation along the z-axis,

)(rI r  has exactly the symmetry of the diamond structure.[11-

12]  Figures  2(a)-(d)  show  the  diamond  structure  for  the  above  configuration.    Note  that  Figs. 

2(a)-(c) look practically the same as those in Figs. 1(d)-(f), respectively.  Figure 2(d) shows the 

“just-connected” contour surfaces in the [111] direction for many unit cells.  As stated before, 

the  interference  depends  very  much  on  the  relatively  phases  of  the  beams.    For  4  beams 

interference, changes of phases only lead to translational shifts of the pattern.  However for 5 

beams, the phase of one of the beams has to be fixed w.r.t the others.  Figures 2(e) and (f) show 

the

, with 95% and 60% intensity cut-

offs.  Note that the diamond symmetry is reduced to that of FCC.  Furthermore the intensity 

contours do not form connected surfaces (shown as an example of separate “sheets” in Fig. 2(f) 

even for a 60% cut-off) until at a very low intensity cut-off.  This phase dependence could lead 

to complications in the fabrication of the diamond structure.  To demonstrate that any 3 of the 

4 side beams together with the central beam 

 in Eq. 4 can be used for FCC lattice, Fig. 2(g)

shows  a  FCC  structure  using  the  same  parameters  as  in  Figs.  2(a)-(d)  but  without  beam 1k

.  

Other  combinations  produce  similar  FCC  structures.    The  diamond  structure  can  also  be 

obtained by a double-exposure, i.e. adding the interference patterns of the x-rods and y-rods as 

in Figs. 1(a)-(b).  In doing so some of the cross terms are automatically eliminated.  Figure 2(h) 

shows a diamond structure using a double-exposure of beams

configurations. 

 

The double-exposure effect can also be simulated using a (4+1)-beam configuration with a 

circular polarized central beam

 beams.  Note that the rods are more elliptical than 

those  in  Figs.  1(a)  and  (b).    Figure  3(c)  shows  the  structure  obtained  by  the  (4+1)-beam 

configuration  with  the  above  parameters.    It  looks  similar  to  those  in  Figs.  1(d)  and  2(a).  

Furthermore, the expanded views, Figs. 3(d)-(e), also are similar (except the contour surfaces 

are more elliptical) to those obtained for the linearly polarization cases, Figs. 1(e)-(f) and 2(b) 

and (c), despite the fact that the ‘non-diamond” cross terms are now larger.  The effect of the 

‘non-diamond’ terms can be reduced by using larger amplitudes for the central beam.   

 

It  was  pointed  out  recently  that  the  use  a  circular  polarized  central  beam,  i.e.

, is equivalent to a double-exposure in which 

the two patterns could have a 90o phase shift w.r.t. each other.[16]  In particular, using a (3+1)-

beam  configuration  (three  linearly  polarized  side  beams  and  one  circular  polarized  central 

beam),  the  diamond  structure  could  be  formed.[16]    However,  in  general  delaying

beams  by  the  same  amount.    Even  if  such  shifting  effect  could  be  achieved  by  appropriate 

choices for the beam amplitudes and polarizations, there is no guarantee the resulting pattern 

will have the diamond structure.  As an example, Figure 3(f) shows a FCC structure using four 

beams

 with parameters as in Figs. 3(a)-(e).  Note that in this case the contour 

surfaces are much distorted as compared to those in Figs. 1(e), 2(b) and 3(d).  Similar results 

 

7

are obtained using other combinations of side beams with the circular polarized central beam.  

To further verify this subtle difference, Figs. 3(g) and (h) show contour surfaces in unit cell,  

showing clearly the FCC structure with long ellipsoidal motifs, at 83% disconnected and 49% 

connected intensity cut-offs, respectively, for a (3+1)-beam configuration using parameters as 

given in Ref. [16].  Despite this pitfall, the idea of using circular central beam can be exploited 

for other applications like the fabrication of spirals as reported recently.[8]       

 

To conclude, we show the woodpile and diamond structures can be obtained by using a 5-

beam holographic interference.  Either linear or circular polarized central beam can be used as 

compared  to  the  elliptical  polarizations  reported  earlier.    Furthermore,  all  the  beams  of  our 

configurations  are  on  the  same  half  space  that  can  be  easily  achieved  experimentally.  

However, since 5 coherent beams are involved, the phases of the beams are crucial and some 

control  of  the  phases  is  needed.    We  have  implemented  the  5-beam  interference  system  and 

results for the woodpile and diamond structures will be reported separately. [17]

Laguerre-Gaussian beams may possess an azimuthal phase variation of 2πl, where 

l is an integer, around the beam axis, resulting in an annular intensity distribution. 

This  azimuthal  phase  variation  can  be  visualized,  as  a  screw  dislocation,  when 

interfering  the  LG  beam  with  its  mirror  image  (a  beam  of  opposite  helicity).  In 

this paper, we examine the evolution of optical beams with a fractional phase step 

hosted  within  a  Gaussian  beam  by  experimental  analysis  of  both  the  phase  and 

intensity distribution. To generate these beams, we introduce differing fractional 

(non-integer)  topological  charge  variations  within  a  Gaussian  beam  generated 

using  a  spatial  light  modulator  (SLM).  We  detect  the  vortex  evolution  from  the 

increase  of  the  fractional  phase  step  by  interfering  two  beams  of  opposite  but 

equal  fractional  step  increment.  The  interference  pattern  generated  shows 

evidence of the birth of an additional single extra charge as the fractional phase 

step increase extends above a half –integer value.

Dislocations or phase defects within a monochromatic wave have been analyzed in detail 

by  J  F  .Nye  et  al  [1].  In  the  analysis,  a  number  of  optical  wavefront  dislocations  have  been 

identified  including  screw  dislocations,  edge  dislocations  and  mixed  screw-edge  dislocations. 

The  most  commonly  studied  phase  defect  in  an  optical  field  is  screw-dislocation.  A  screw 

dislocation in an optical beam results in a phase singularity at the centre of the beam where the 

phase  is  not  defined.  Hence  when  a  screw  dislocation  is  hosted  within  a  Gaussian  beam,  the 

resulting  beam  will  exhibit  an  annular  intensity  profile  whilst  maintaining  a  helical  phase 

structure. A typical example of such a light field is a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beam [2].  

The phase singularity and orbital angular momentum embedded in the LG beam is due to 

its helical phase structure, denoted in the mode description by 

ile φ where 2πl is the helical phase 

around the circumference of the optical field [2]. Such beams have generated widespread interest 

in  the  last  decade  for  optical  rotation  of  micro-particles  [3],  quantum  entanglement  of  photons 

[4], nonlinear optics [5] and optical vortex interactions [6].  

Recently  there  has  been  significant  interest  in  fractional  half-charge  dislocations 

embedded within optical beams [7 - 12]. To date, for the generation of an optical beam of half-

integer fractional charge, both spiral phase plate [10, 11] and off-axis holograms [7, 8] have been 

used.  I.V  Basistiy  et  al  made  use  of  a  computer-generated  hologram,  based  on  a  half-integer 

screw  dislocation,  to  generate  a  monochromatic  beam.  In  a  recent  publication,  Berry  et  al  [12] 

shows  mathematically  the  non-existence  of  the  fractionally  charge  vortices  during  propagation, 

through mathematical derivation. Berry also deduces a unity phase jump and birth of a vortex as 

the  fractional  phase  reaches  and  passes  a  half-integer  value.  Thus  to  investigate  fractional 

topological  charges  we  need  to  both  generalize  the  range  of  fractional  phase  steps  available  as 

well as study the evolution of the beam as this fractional phase step is varied .

In this paper, we investigate fractional phase steps hosted in a Gaussian beam, by means 

of a spatial light modulator (SLM). In contrast to previous studies we are able to  generate any 

arbitrary  fractional  phase  step  within  the  light  field  and  specifically  visualize  the  birth  and 

evolution of additional charges as we increase the fractional order of the light field. Furthermore, 

we  show,  for  the  first  time  to  our  knowledge,  the  experimental  study  of  non-integer  fractional 

phase step embedded within an optical beam through an interference [13] experiment that very 

clearly elucidates the evolution of the charge within the beam profile. Such dynamic generation 

of  the  fractional  phase  step  provides  a  detailed  study  of  the  fractional  phase  shift  within  the 

optical  beam.  In  comparison  to  static  off-axis  holograms  and  spiral  phase  plates,  the  SLM 

generation  and  subsequent  interferometric  analysis  is  able  to  provide  a  real-time  study  of  such 

phase evolution 

LG  beams  may  be  generated  by  off-axis  computer  generated  holograms  (CGH)  with 

dislocations.  This  is  based  on  the  fact  that  when  a  plane  wave  interferes  at  an  angle  with  a 

Laguerre-Gaussian  beam,  shown  in  Equation  (1),  of  the  following  expression,  a  dislocation  is 

formed. Such holograms with dislocations appear in the form of a forked diffraction grating [14]:

In this experimental work, we generated beams as in equation 3 choosing to implement a 

fractional  phase  azimuthal  variation  increasing  in  steps  of  0.1  where  l1  denotes  the  starting 

integer  value  of  the  phase  step  and  l2/10  (l2  integer)  is  the  fractional  increment  we  add  to  the 

topological charge. Thus in these cases, l1=0, 1, 2, 3, 4… but l2 varies only from 1 to 10 for each 

integer value of l1.  

Our experimental setup consists of a collimated laser beam of 632.8nm (maximum power 

30mW)  which  is  directed  onto  the  SLM  (Non-linear  Boulder  System)  a  Nematic  SLM,  which 

displays the grayscale sinusoidal off-axis hologram. The beam is then recorded with “Beamstar-

1500”  CCD  beam  profiler.  By  interfering  the  generated  beam  hosting  the  fractional  phase 

azimuthal  variation  with  a  plane  wave  mathematically,  a  series  of  off-axis  computer  generated 

holograms are generated on an SLM as shown in Figure 1. In Figure 1, it is interesting to note 

that as l2 varies only from 1 to 10 for l1=0, the centre of the CGH generated slowly shifted to the 

left by an interval of π/5. When l2 reaches 10, a charge 1 dislocation is formed at the centre of the

CGH,  which  results  in  a  single  integer  phase  step  embedded  within  the  charge  one  LG  beam. 

Hence the fractional phase increment from also be observed through the changes in the CGH. 

By  observing  the  generated  fractional  phase  step  within  the  beam,  as  shown  in  Figure  2  and  3,  we  can  clearly  observe  the 

changes in the optical wavefront at  a distance of 0.7zR where zR denotes the Rayleigh range of the beam. In our experiment, 

we were able to observe a step discontinuity appears, for l2≠0, in the wavefront modulation 

through  its  intensity  pattern  as  shown  in  Figure  2  and  3.  Our  experimental  results  for  the 

intensity distribution shows that even a fractional phase step of 0.1 hosted with optical beam 

will cause a defect to exist within the optical beam. This defect is solely due to the presence 

of the fractional phase step within the optical beam. 

It is also possible for us to treat an optical beam of fractional phase step as a superposition 

of  several  axially  symmetric  optical  beams  of  different  integer  topological  charges  [7,  9].  It  is 

well known from the work of Beijersbergen et al  [9] that to obtain the accurate mode description 

of the output of a spiral phase plate or hologram we may decompose the beam in terms of the full 

orthonormal basis set of LG beams giving us the appropriate weightings, for each constituent LG 

mode. Modes of fractional order require significant weightings, in principle of an infinite number 

of  modes,  and  it  has  been  suggested  they  can  be  used  for  more  detailed  studies  of  high-

dimensional quantum entanglement and violations of Bell’s inequalities [11]. 

By  interfering  the  opposite  diffractive  orders  (±1)  from  the  SLM,  we  are  able  to 

show the evolution of the fractional phase step through the fork fringe formation: the birth of 

a  new  vortex  manifests  itself  as  the  appearance  of  a  forked  fringe  in  the  aforementioned 

interference pattern 

In  the  set-up,  we  interfere  both  the  +1st  and  -1st  diffraction  order  from  the  off-axis 

hologram using the two mirrors. By interfering the two opposite diffraction orders at an angle, we 

can observe the helicity of the individual optical beam [13] and obviate any errors due to Guoy 

 

5

phase  mismatch.  Hence,  the  resulting  helicity  or  fork  fringes  lR  will  follow  an  express  of  the 

form: 

As shown theoretically by Berry [12], when the fractional phase step increases beyond the 

half-integer value, an extra vortex is born within the optical beam.

where l2 is a varies from 1 to10 in this case. 

We conclusively verify this in our experiment, as we are able to observe such evolution of 

the  extra  vortex  from  Figure  5  and  6.  In  Figure  5,  the  fork  fringes  show  that  the  fractional 

azimuthal phase increment is clearly observed as l2 /10 increases from 0.1 to 1. The fork fringes 

when  phase  azimuthal  variation  is  0.5  shows  the  formation  of  a  charge  2  fork  fringe,  which 

equals to |1-(-1)| using Equation 5. In Figure 6, there is also a clear evolution of an extra fringe at 

the fractional phase step of 1.5. At the fractional phase-step of 1.5, the fringe sums up to |2-(-2)|. 

From the formation of the interference fork fringes of two opposite fractional phase steps 

embedded  within  the  Gaussian  beam,  we  have  directly  showed  the  evolution  of  the  fractional 

phase step experimentally. We have shown that the singularity jump increases by unity when the 

fractional phase step reaches the mid-point of (l2 /10)=0.5. 

In conclusion, we have experimentally generated optical beams with arbritary fractional 

phase step increments using an SLM. Furthermore, we have shown the evolution of the fractional 

phase  variation  through  a  Michelson  interferometer.  These  changes  in  the  fractional  phase 

variation  show  the birth of  new vortex as the fractional phase steps reaches a half-integer value. 

The  interferometric  patterns  show  how  an  additional  vortex  is  created  and  evolves  within  the 

 

6

beam.  Fractional  phase  steps  are  of  interest  in  advanced  studies  of  quantum  entanglement  [11] 

and have analogies to quantum flux in the Aharonov-Bohm effect  [12].

1 Introduction

The Feynman path integral reveals in a geometric intuitive way the relation
between classical and quantum dynamics. However there are few examples of
path integral quantizations on compact phase spaces. These are interesting
because they have ﬁnite dimensional Hilbert spaces. The simplest example
is a phase space with the topology of a torus. A more interesting case is
obtained by considering a phase space with the topology of the sphere S2.
Quantization of this gives the spin. A path integral quantization is described
in [1, 2]. Here I will present a generalization of this result, the case of the
deformed spin.

Let G be a Lie group. On the vector space g∗ dual to the Lie algebra g
of G there is a natural Poisson structure. In terms of linear coordinates ei

Quantization of the coadjoint orbits of a Lie group G gives its unitary rep-
resentations [13]. Various methods were used to quantize these symplectic
leaves including geometric quantization and the Feynman path integral [1, 2].
Note that the vector space g∗ can be thought of as an abelian group. The
above picture can be generalized to include Poisson brackets on non-abelian
groups G∗ usually called the dual Poisson-Lie groups. This will be extensively
discussed in Section 2. Quantization of their symplectic leaves gives the uni-
Uq(g). This can be summarized
tary representations of the quantum group

The quantization axis is horizontal, with classical Poisson-Lie groups on the
left and their quantizations on the right. The vertical axis corresponds to de-
formation of the abelian case to the non-abelian case. Note that the abelian
case can be obtained from the non-abelian case by looking at an inﬁnitesimal
neighborhood of the unit of the group, and rescaling coordinates appropri-
ately. Throughout this paper I will refer to the lower part of the picture
already discussed in [1, 2] as the trivial case§, and to the upper part as the
Poisson case.

I will use the Feynman path integral to quantize the symplectic leaves of
SU(2)∗. In doing this I will follow closely the method used in [1]. In fact, a
strong parallel exists both at the classical and the quantum levels. Classically,
the leaves coincide in the trivial and Poisson cases once expressed in terms
of Darboux coordinates. Consequently, at the quantum level we have the
same Hilbert space and the two quantum algebras are isomorphic. The path
integral has the same form in the trivial and Poisson cases, but one has to
insert diﬀerent functions to obtain su(2) or

Uq(su(2)) generators.

In Section 2, I review some general Poisson-Lie theory mainly to ﬁx the
notation and to list some results used later in the paper. The results in this
section are given using complex coordinates.
In Section 3, I describe the
reality structures of SU(2), its dual and its double. I also give a detailed
description of the symplectic leaves of SU(2)∗.

In Section 4, I describe Darboux coordinates, formulate the path integral
and ﬁnd the radius quantization condition using a quantization condition
similar to [1]. I also deﬁne the Hilbert space and obtain the matrix elements

§The Poisson bracket on G discussed in Section 2 is trivial in this case

show that they are representations of the quantum group algebra.
In the
last section I draw some conclusions and suggest how this work might be
generalized. Finally, the appendix reviews the isomorphism of F unq(SU(2)∗)
Uq(su(2)) and the derivation of the Poisson bracket on SU(2)∗ from
and
F unq(SU(2)∗).

2 Dual Pairs of Poisson-Lie Groups

,

{

}

A Poisson-Lie Group (PLG) is a pair (G,
,

) where G is a Lie group and
is a Poisson bracket on G which is compatible with the group operations
{
of multiplication and inversion [8]. The compatibility determines the Poisson
structure at an arbitrary point from its values in the vicinity of the group
unit. A PLG can be equivalently described as a Poisson Hopf algebra F un(G)
which is a commutative Hopf algebra with a compatible Poisson algebra. In
what follows I will freely exchange these two dual descriptions.

The Poisson bracket on the group determines a Lie algebra structure on
the cotangent space g∗ of the Lie group. Let h1 and h2 be two functions on
the group G. Then:

[dh1, dh2]∗

deﬁnes a Lie algebra (g∗, [, ]∗). One can check that this deﬁnition is indepen-
ei}
dent of the choice of functions used to represent cotangent vectors. Let
its dual basis in g∗, and f k
be a basis of g,
the corresponding
structure constants. The compatibility of the Poisson and group structures
imposes restrictions on the two Lie algebras. In terms of the structure con-
stants, they read

In fact, similarly to a Lie group being determined up to some global features
by its Lie algebra, a PLG is in one to one correspondence with a Lie bialgebra

(LBA). This is a pair (g, g∗) of Lie algebras dual as vector spaces whose
structure constants satisfy (1). Note that the LBA structure is symmetric
between g and g∗, so to each LBA we can associate a pair of PLGs G and
G∗.

An equivalent deﬁnition of a LBA is given in terms of the cocommutator

we can give an explicit description of the dual group SL(N, C)∗ and its Pois-
son structure despite the fact that it is not quasi-triangular. Let SL(N, C)∗

3 Symplectic Leaves

In the ﬁrst part of this section, I will discuss the SL(N, C) case. So far,
everything was complex. The simplest reality structure one can impose is
to require everything to be real. We then obtain SL(N, R), its double, dual
etc. However, we want to obtain SU(N). We start on the double with the
reality structure

x† = y−1.

Since G and G∗ are subgroups, this induces the following reality structures

T † = T −1, (L+)† = (L−)−1.

(10)

Once we impose (10) the dual group is no longer simply connected, since ai
in (4) are real and non-zero. Deﬁne SU(N)∗ as the component connected to
the unit element of the group.

SU(N)∗ =

(L+, L−)

We can also describe SU(N)∗ in terms of L as the set of hermitian, posi-
tive deﬁnite matrices of determinant one. Then the map (L+, L−)
L =
(L−)−1L+ is one to one and the factorization is unique.

→

For SU(2)∗ the reality structure is ¯α = α, ¯δ = δ, ¯β = γ.
To summarize, the double of SU(N) is SL(N, C), and the factorization
(9) can be written x = T −1L+, that is to say, any matrix of determinant one
can be decomposed uniquely as the product of a special unitary matrix and
an upper triangular matrix with real positive diagonal entries∗∗.

In particular the double of SU(2) is the proper Lorentz group SL(2, C).

It is interesting to note that the double of the trivial PLG SU(2), i.e.
cotangent bundle, is the proper homogeneous Galilean group.

4 Path Integral Quantization

The path integral quantization of the Poisson algebra on the leaves of su(2)∗
was discussed in [1, 2]. Quantization of these leaves gives the unitary rep-
resentations of SU(2). We will do the same for the symplectic leaves above
Uq(su(2)) algebra. This is in fact
and obtain the unitary representations of
a Hopf algebra but we concentrate here on the algebra structure††.

Before starting the quantization we have to ﬁnd canonical coordinates on

the leaves. Note that

Ω0 = sin θ dθ

The Poisson algebra on any leaf can be quantized, but in general these
quantum algebras will not have unitary representations. Unitarity leads to a
quantization of the radius of the Poisson sphere. Before starting the Poisson
case let us review two diﬀerent quantization conditions used in [1, 2] for the
trivial case. In [2] a geometric quantization condition similar to that used for
the Dirac monopole or the Wess-Zumino-Witten model was used to obtain
the allowed values of the radius. The action must be continuous as the path
crosses over the poles. Equivalently

ei/¯h

Θ = 1

H

where the integral is over an inﬁnitesimal loop around the poles. However this
condition was only used to determine the characters of the representations.
Also note that, unlike the Dirac monopole where the action is a conﬁguration
space action, both in the trivial and the Poisson case one has a phase space
action.

However in [1] it was shown that in order to obtain the matrix elements of
su(2) a non-trivial phase has to exist as the path crosses the poles. Requiring
the correct matrix elements one obtains the quantization condition

(13)

(14)

This gives the same result as (13) for the Cartan generator and thus for the
characters. Here I will use (14) and show that we obtain the standard matrix
elements of the quantum qroup generators.

Θ =

Imposing (14) at the north and south poles we obtain the quantization
r = N¯h/2 where N is a positive integer. For N odd one can set c = 0 but a
non-zero c is required for even N. The simplest choice is c = ¯h/2. We can
write the two cases together as

Θ = (J + M¯h/2) dφ, M = 0, 1.

Next I list some of the functions on the Poisson sphere that I will quantize,

5 Matrix Elements and the Quantum Alge-

bra

Since this is a phase space path integral some care must be taken when
quantizing functions which depend on canonically conjugate variables. The
(J)Φ(φ) is to
standard mid-point prescription for a function of the form
(Ji)Φ[(φi + φi−1)/2] in the path integral. Thus for functions of
write it as
(Ji)eip(φi+φi−1)/2. To calculate the
the form
matrix elements of such an operator we insert it in the path integral (18) with
H = 0 and take T inﬁnitesimal. For the prescription above it is suﬃcient to
consider only one time interval. The matrix elements are

Using the opposite mid-point prescription

[(Ji + Ji−1)/2]eipφi gives the
same matrix elements. However in this case one has to consider at least two
time intervals if working in the φ representation. This prescription is more
convenient when working in the J representation.

F

We can use (19) to calculate matrix elements of any function on SU(2)∗.
Mid-point prescription in the path integral results in a special ordering of
the quantum operators, when expressed in terms of J and φ, called Weyl
ordering. If one starts from the Gauss’s decomposition, uses path integral
to obtain the matrix elements of a and χ± and then uses them to express

17

L± as products of quantum matrices, we obtain the quantum commutation
relations [9]. Using (19) we obtain

(a)m′m = e−¯hm′/2 δm′−m,0

addition while the functional dependence in terms of J and φ can be easily
obtained from (23) the overall normalization of X± has been adjusted to
give the standard result. The same kind of normalization adjustments are
necessary if one tries to insert the matrix elements of L± directly into the
path integral. This just reﬂects ordering ambiguities of quantum operators.
Alternatively one could get the standard result without any adjustments
of normalization by using a non-midpoint prescription. For example the oﬀ-
diagonal element of L+ equals aχ+ with this speciﬁc ordering in the quantum
case. Since the path integral gives time ordering we can obtain the desired
quantum ordering by using the following prescription

6 Concluding Remarks

O

O

In addition to trying to generalize the results in [1, 2] my goal in this paper
was to better understand the quantization (22) of the Poisson bracket (5).
(¯h2) used in (22) would give the same
Any R± satisfying R± = 1 + ¯hr± +
(¯h2) and higher order terms are
Poisson bracket in the classical limit. The
ﬁxed by requireing that (22) are commutation relations of a Hopf algebra
deformation of the original Poisson-Hopf algebra. It is natural then to ask
what is the relation of this quantization to the quantization known as Weyl
quantization. Of course this question could be answered using algebraic
methods without appealing to path integrals. At least for the case of SU(2),
I found that the functions χ± and a appearing in the Gauss’s decomposition
play a special role. Their quantization using Weyl ordering gives the same
commutation relations as in the quantum group quantization. It would be
interesting to investigate if this result still holds for an arbitrary SU(N).

It should be possible to generalize the path integral formulated in this pa-
per to arbitrary classical groups. The similarity between the trivial and the
Poisson cases for SU(2) suggests that a starting point could be the path in-
tegral quantization of the coadjoint orbits of classical groups discussed in [2].
The existence of a non-trivial phase as the path crosses the poles discussed
in [1] is present in the Poisson case too. A better understanding of the origin

20

of this phase would be welcomed.

Let us now compare the trivial and Poisson cases. The symplectic leaves
in both cases are spheres parametrized by (z, ¯z) in stereographic projection.
The group SU(2) acts in the same way on the leaves in the two cases, i.e.
by standard rotations of the spheres, but in the trivial case the bracket is
invariant under the action, while in the Poisson case the action is only a
Poisson action. However, once the symplectic form is expressed in Darboux
coordinates (J, φ) the leaves appear to be identical. As a consequence the
path integral has the same form as in [1, 2], but since the transformation
to the Darboux variables is non-trivial in the Poisson case, SU(2) acts in a
complicated way on the leaves, and functions on SU(2)∗ have a complicated
dependence on (J, φ). Compare for example (25) and (26). Thus the same
path integral generates diﬀerent matrix elements because we insert diﬀerent
functions in the trivial and Poisson cases. This shows explicitly that on the
same symplectic manifold one can implement both a trivial and a Poisson
symmetry. The question of which is the actual symmetry of the system is
a dynamical one, and can only be answered after we know the Hamiltonian.
Finally, I conjecture that as in the SU(2) case, for an arbitrary classical
group, the path integral has the same form in the trivial and Poisson cases.

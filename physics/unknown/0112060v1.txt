Abstract 
 
On the KEK-ATF accelerator the proof-of-principle experiment will be carried out, 
in which is planned to obtain a circularly polarized beam of γ-quanta with energy < 60 
MeV for the subsequent generation of longitudinal - polarized positrons. [1] 

The  circularly  polarized  γ-quanta  with  energy  >  10  MeV  are  formed  during 
Compton  backscattering  of  circularly  polarized  laser  photons  on  an  electron  beam 
with  energy  1.26  GeV.  The  contribution  of  nonlinear  processes  for  planned 
parameters of a laser flash [2] can be rather significant, that leads to deterioration of 
polarization  of  a  resulting  γ-  beam.  The  direct  method  of  measurement  of  γ-beam 
circular  polarization  will  allow  not  only  to  estimate  a  correctness  of  the  theoretical 
calculations,  but  also  to  use  the  obtained  information  for  simulation  of  polarization 
parameters of positrons. 

We offer to use a Compton polarimeter for this purpose where the recoil electrons 
after an interaction of a circularly polarized γ-quanta with a thin iron magnetized target 
are detected. The magnetic analysis of the recoil electrons allows to reject effectively 
the  contribution  of  background  processes.  The  geometry  of  a  polarimeter  was

Introduction 
 
A  proof-of-principle  experiment  will  be  carried  out  on  the  KEK-ATF  accelerator, 
where it is planned to obtain a circularly polarized beam of γ-quanta with the energy < 
60 MeV for the subsequent generation of longitudinally - polarized positrons. [1] 

Circularly  polarized  γ-quanta  with  the energy > 10 MeV are formed by Compton 
backscattering of circularly polarized laser photons in a 1.26 GeV electron beam. The 
contribution from nonlinear processes at the given laser flash parameters [2] can be 
rather appreciable, which leads to deterioration of the resulting γ- beam polarization. 

The  experimental  measurements  of  the  degree  of  circular  polarization  of  a  γ- 
beam  will  primarily  allow  one  to  verify  the  theoretical  calculations  (or  the  simulation 
results). Secondly, the experimental error of the direct method of measuring γ- beam 
circular  polarization  is  likely  to  be  less  than  the  theoretical  uncertainty.  It  should  be 
mentioned  that  simulation  of  the 
  pair  production  process  in  an  amorphous 
converter  (taking  into  account  the  polarization  states  of  the  particles  participating  in 
the  reaction)  may  be  done  to  a  much  higher  precision  than  that  of  nonlinear 
processes in a Gaussian beam of laser photons. Therefore, simulation with the known 
spectrum and polarization of a γ- beam will provide reliable information on polarization 
of a positron beam.

We offer to use a Compton polarimeter for the analysis of circular polarization of a 
γ-quantum  with  the  energy 
γE >10MeV.  In  an  earlier  experiment  [3],  a  similar 
polarimeter was used to measure circular polarization of a γ-quantum with the energy 
Е  =  2.6  MeV.  However,  as  the  γ-quantum  energy  grows  the  efficiency  of  such  a 
polarimeter is decreased. Furthermore, the time history of the γ- beam reported in the 
experiment  [1]  is  not  helpful  in  detecting  the  scattered  γ-quanta  with  a  sufficient 
rejection  of  the  background  processes.  The  proposed  set-up  of  a  Compton 
polarimeter is shown in Fig. 1. A circularly polarized γ-quantum beam passes through 
a thin ferromagnetic foil placed in a constant magnetic field. About 7 % electrons in 
the  target  are  oriented  by  the  spin  along  the  field,  whose  reversal  allows  one  to 
change the electron polarization sign. 

 
Compton polarimeter for the analysis of circular polarization of a γγγγ- beam 
 
The Compton scattering process (two-particle reaction) is entirely determined by 
the  angle  of  one  of  the  outgoing  particles  (electron  or  photon).  In  the  polarimeter 
scheme shown, the recoil electrons are to be detected by a magnetic analyzer. The 
analyzer  field  is  selected  such  that  the  electron  momentum  corresponds  to  the 
θ ,  at  which  the  analyzer  is  located  (Fig.  1).  In  this  case,  the 
outgoing  angle 
contribution  from  background  electrons  from  pair  production  in  the  nucleus  field 
(three-particle reaction) will be largely suppressed.   This polarimeter scheme allows 
one to detect Compton electrons during the spill of a few picosecond duration (time of

detector  D  (a  Cherenkov  counter)  will  correspond  to  the  sum  of  responses  of  each 
photon.

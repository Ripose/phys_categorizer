Abstract 

The  intense  neutron  source  for  development  of  fusion 
materials  planned  by  international  collaboration  makes  a 
new  step  to  clarify  the  technical  issues  for  realizing  the 
40 MeV,  250 mA  deuteron  beam  facility.  The  baseline 
concept  employs  two  identical  125 mA  linac  modules 
whose beams are combined at the flowing lithium target. 
Recent  work  for  reducing  the  cost  loading  concerns  the 
staged  deployment  of  the  full  irradiation  capability  in 
three  steps.  The  Japanese  activity  about  the  design  and 
development study about IFMIF accelerator in this year is 
presented  and  the  schedule  of  next  several  years  is 
overviewed. 

1  INTRODUCTION 

The  International  Fusion  Materials  Irradiation  Facility 
(IFMIF)  is  an  IEA  collaboration  to  construct  an  intense 
neutron  source  for  development  of  fusion  materials  [1]. 
The  250-mA,  40-MeV  deuteron  beam  is  required  to 
satisfy  the  neutron  flux  level  (wall  load  equivalent  to  2 
MW/m2 ~ 9x1013 neutrons/cm2/s ~ 19 dpa/y for Fe) with 
enough  irradiation  volume  (>500  cm3).  As  the  basic 
concept  discussed  during  these  five  years  of  CDA 
(Conceptual  Design  Activity),  a  set  of  two  identical 
175 MHz,  125 mA  linacs  is  employed  to  achieve  the 
beam current requirement [2]. After the request from the 
Fusion  Program  Coordination  Committee  (FPCC)  in 
January  1999,  a  plan  with  the  reduction  of  the  facility 
construction  cost  (estimated  at  1996)  and  the  project 
schedule  with  a  staged  approach  to  match  to  the  fusion 
reactor  development  plan  is  proposed  at  2000  FPCC 
meeting.  It  consists  of  three  stages  and  each  stage 
achieves  20%,  50%  and  100%  of  the  full  irradiation 
capability  shown  above,  respectively.  The  prospects  for 
materials development are recognized though the series of 
research  items:  the  selection  of  materials  for  ITER  test 
blanket module as  a  near  term  milestone,  the  acquisition 
of  engineering  data  for  reactor  prototype  (like  DEMO), 
and the evaluation of lifetime of candidate materials.  

From  the  accelerator  technology  viewpoints,  some 
essential key issues need to be solved before starting the 
construction,  i.e.  extremely  stable  155 mA  deuteron 
injector, 175 MHz coupled cavity cw-RFQ, precise beam 
dynamics simulation to realize the beam loss control, etc. 
The  most  problem  should  be  addressed  by  prototyping, 
however,  some  prior  verification  about  the  component 
technology  is  necessary  to  initiate  it.  In  the  next  several 

years,  we  concentrate  on  the  restricted  area  of  key 
component  technologies  to  proceed  to  the  next  coming 
Engineering  Validation  Phase  (EVP)  as  a  preparation  of 
construction phase. 

2  STAGING CONCEPT 

2.1  Overview 

In the staged facility design, the layout of two  40 MeV 
deuteron linac modules becomes simple coplanar form to 
be upgraded easily. The major parameters of linac module 
are  summarized  in  Table  1  and  the  layout  of  one 
accelerator module is shown in Fig. 1.

1 Narrower width may be requested at 1st and 2nd stages to keep 
charge density of full current beam. 

The number of irradiation test cells is reduced from two 
to one that would be possible to rearrange the schedule of 
irradiation tests, so that the High Energy Beam Transport 
has  only  one  beam  line.  The  electromagnetic  pump  is 
redesigned to minimize the volume of the  loop  for  high-
speed lithium flow used as the neutron-generating target. 
The resulting lithium inventory becomes 9 m3 from prior 
value 21 m3. The newly estimated cost indicates that  the 
1st phase of 50mA operation can be started by 38% of the 
total cost (~$800M) formerly obtained at CDA phase and 
the integral cost of all stages can be compressed to 60% 
of the former cost [3]. 

The construction/operation is divided into three stages: 
(1)  50 mA  operation  of  a  full  performance  linac  for  ~5 
years,  (2)  full  power  125 mA  operation  of  the  first  linac 
for ~5 years, and (3) 250-mA operation with an addition 
of  the  second  linac  for  more  than  20  years.  Other  major 
parameters are not greatly changed from the CDA design 
but  the  cut  of  redundancy  of  the  reduced  cost  design 
might  influence  to  the  overall  availability,  especially  at 
the initial stage operation. 
2.2  Injector 

The ion source for 155mA deuteron beam with required 
quality is almost available at the present technology. Only 
the  verification  of  long-term  stability  and  long  lifetime 
should be addressed, and these tasks will be performed in 
a  couple  of  year.  As  the  actual  operation  starts  from 
50mA  in  the  staged  approach,  the  lifetime  issue  is  also 
relaxed. 

On the other hand, LEBT is still problematic because of 
the less controllability of the space charge neutralization. 
The pulsing method to apply at the start up procedure is 
another  unresolved  issue.  The  use  of  H2+  beam  at  the 
prototype or commissioning phase brings the extra task to 
calibrate  and  correlate  the  measurements  with  D  beam 
case. 

2.3  RFQ 

initial  bunching  section  mainly  and  along 

As shown in Fig. 1, the output energy of IFMIF RFQ is 
5MeV  (CDA  design  employed  8MeV  output)  and  the 
final decision of the transition energy is made just before 
the construction probably.  In any case, the length of RFQ 
exceeds 8 m and the coupled cavity technique developed 
by  LANL  [4]  is  needed  to  maintain  the  field  uniformity 
along the structure. The beam loss in RFQ usually occurs 
at 
the 
acceleration  section  in  a  small  part,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2. 
The loss at low energy part will generate  neutron  due  to 
D(d,n) reaction for the self-impinged deuteron at the vane 
surface. It may helpful to be coated by high-Z material at 
vane  tip  and  to  use  a  method  of  surface  cleaning  to 
remove  deuteron  gas  periodically.  For  the  loss  at  higher 
energy  part  high-Z  material  coating  may  also  useful  but 
the  better  solution  is  stop  of  RFQ  with  a  small  aperture 
size.  This  might  push  the  lowering  of  transition  energy 

because  RFQ  with  large  bore  is  inefficient  accelerating 
structure. Again the final decision requires the acquisition 
of many precise calculations and accurate measurements.

using PARMTEQ (top:x, middle:φ-φs, bottom:W-Ws). 

 

2.4  DTL 

In the baseline design, Alvarez DTL is employed as the 
main accelerator, with single stem and post coupler. CDA 
design  uses  3cm  bore  size  for  all  drift  tubes  so  that 
minimum  incident  energy  is  around  8  MeV  if  the 
conventional  electromagnetic  quadrupole  using  FoDo 
structure.  The  reduced  cost  design  prefers  the  lower 
transition  energy  so  that  either  the  focusing  scheme 
change like FoFoDoDo or bore radius change is necessary. 
Figure 3 indicates the PARMILA run of the former case. 
The  resultant  emittance  growth  is  larger  than  that  for 
FoDo case and we need to seek the best compromise  on  
bore size. The gradient ramping at the beginning of DTL 
is  another  issue  to  be  addressed  at  prototyping  and 
extensive electromagnetic calculation is scheduled.

2.5 RF System 

The  most  of  accelerator  tanks  is  configured  as  multi-
drive form using 2 independent 1MW RF amplifier units 
shown  in  Fig.  4.  At  the  first  stage  50  mA  operation  is 
achieved by removing one of two units and it is installed 

at the later stage. The circulator at the final output is not 
used in the current design because it might be error-prone 
component  from  the  experience  at  ICRF  heating.  The 
serious analysis of such RF system control and response is 
necessary.

2.6  HEBT 

The  design  of  new  HEBT  line  is  relaxed  due  to  its 
simplicity  of  the  beam  transport  line,  however,  it  still 
requires the beam redistribution at target (20cm width and 
5cm  height  with  uniform  distribution  except  ramping  at 
both  vertical  ends).  The  resulting  line  consists  of  an 
achromatic parallel translation with two dipoles and static 
multipole magnet and imager qudrupoles as redistribution 
system and the last dipole bend, after that there is a 14m 
long drift space only till Li target.  

The beam calibration dump placed at the middle of two 
Li target stations in CDA design is disappeared now, and 
alternative  beam  stop  is  desired  for  start  up  tuning 
purpose, which accepts several 100 kW power.  The  best 
place  is  straight  end  of  the  last  dipole  and  it  should  be 
checked  against  the  neutron  back  streaming  from  beam 
dump. 

2.7  Superconducting Linac 

From  the  beginning  of  the  IFMIF  design  study,  the 
superconducting  linac  (SCL)  was  considered  as  the 
promising alternative to DTL and the progress of general 
technology  has  been  tracked.  For  the  possible  use  in  the 
future upgrade, the compatibility with DTL and SCL are 
always  concerned.  Fig.  5  shows  the  one  of  the  low  β 
structure for IFMIF purpose.

3  DEVELOPMENT 

The  items  covered  in  KEP  include  the  long  lifetime 
injector  of  accelerator  system,  the  lithium  flow  stability 
test of target system, the temperature control of specimens 
of  test  cell  facility,  etc.  The  results  of  these  tests 
contribute to realize the detailed design of the equipment 
for  the  next  coming  EVP  to  achieve  the  stable  system 
operation.  The items, injector test, RFQ cold model, DT 
packaging  test  are  proposed  as  KEP  tasks  to  be  carried 
out in Japan with the possible international collaboration 
and  the  cooperative  sharing  between  JAERI  and  the 
Japanese universities groups [6]. 

4  ADVANCED CONCEPT 

The new scheme to realize the intense neutron source is 
a  continuing  task  and  a  variation  using  Li  flow  without 
backwall us given in Fig.6, which is mixed with a partial 
energy recovery of deuteron beam to save electrical power.

5  SUMMARY 

The materials development is one of the most important 
issues related to fusion programs, and it results in a new 
step to verify the key element technology, which needs to 
be  carried  out  by  using  all  possible  international  and 
domestic resources.

Abstract 
The motion of a massless charge without self-interaction is considered in a given, arbitrary EM field 
within the framework of Maxwell electrodynamics. A well-defined equation of motion is found which, 
depending on the fields, permits superluminal speeds and time-reversals. 
 
Background 
It  is  conceivable  that,  privately,  Feynman  was  thinking  classically,  when  he  conjectured  that  all 
electrons and positrons possess the same qualities because they are the same particle – undergoing 
time  reversals  [1].  Classical  electrodynamics’  (CED)  prohibition  of  superluminal  speeds  and  time-
reversals of charged particles of real, finite rest mass would seem to rule out this possibility. But not 
so for massless charges: CED without the traditional inertial-mass action turns out to permit well-
defined superluminal and time-reversing trajectories, from which it is but a short step to nonlocality 
and  pair-creation  –  normally  regarded  as  domains  exclusive to QM and QFT. This interesting and 
neglected feature of CED has the potential to be of import wherever the fundamentality of mass is in 
question.  Included  in  this  are  programs  founded  upon  the  conviction  that  inertia  is  of 
electromagnetic origin, including recent attempts calling upon a special role for an electromagnetic 
background  noise  field  (the  ZPF)  [2-8].  Since,  independent  of  the  details,  all  such  programs  are 
implicitly founded upon a massless bare charge, it follows that if framed classically they will inherit 
the novel and QED-like properties described herein, hinting at a possible unification of quantum and 
classical theory at a pre-mass level. 
 
No self-action 
Traditionally, the action of the particle’s own field upon itself gives rise to Coulomb self-energy and 
radiation  reaction.  The  infinite  self-energy  may  be  treated  by  mass-renormalization  –  classical  or 
quantum theoretical – to leave a finite, observable mass. This procedure suggests the relation self-
action (cid:217) inertial mass, from which it follows that the initially massless particle considered herein 
must  be  free  of  self-action.  Since  radiation  reaction  is  also  an  action  of  the  particle’s  fields  upon 
itself,  one  concludes  that  a  massless  particle  is  not  subject  to  radiation  reaction.  It  follows  from 
energy and momentum conservation that the secondary radiation emitted by the particle can carry 
no  intrinsic  energy  or  momentum.  All  these  requirements  -  no  Coulomb  self-energy,  no  radiation 
reaction,  no  radiation  energy  or  momentum  –  are  satisfied  if  the  free-field  stress-energy  tensor 
contains  only  off-diagonal  combinations  of  fields  from  different  sources.  I.E.,  where  the  energy

This modification to the definition of field energy does not impact the evolution of the fields; the field 
equations  are  unchanged  from  their  traditional  Maxwell  form.  To  see  this,  first  recall  that  in  the

removal of self-terms from the action has no effect on the inhomogeneous equation for the fields. (It 
will, of course, impact second quantization, since the free-field Hamiltonian is changed.) 
 
Though  for  a  different  reason,  ‘no  self-action’  is  the  position  adopted  in  the  classical  direct  action 
program of Wheeler and Feynman [9,10]. (The approach has since been extended to relativistic QM, 
[11].) The ingoing aim of that program was to build a theory in which there are no field degrees of 
freedom,  only  source-source  interactions.  Such  a  theory  is  necessarily  time-symmetric,  from  which 
perspective  radiation  reaction  (for  instance  as  it  appears  in  the  Lorentz-Dirac  equation)  cannot  be 
fundamental;  it  vanishes  automatically  from  the  fundamental  dynamics  upon  admitting  both 
advanced  and  retarded  radiation.  In  the  Wheeler  and  Feynman  presentation  the  appearance  of 
radiation  reaction  at  the  ‘observed’  level  is  subsequently  explained  as  a  consequence  of  the  (time-
asymmetric) boundary conditions on the radiation at infinity. This translates into a local asymmetry 
of advanced and retarded influences reflected from distant sources, rather than the traditional time-
asymmetric  self-action.  Consequently,  in  their  theory,  self-action  has  no  role  in  the  explanation  of 
radiation reaction. Even so, the total absence of self-action is not mandatory. Nevertheless, Wheeler 
and Feynman exercise the opportunity to exclude it, thereby simultaneously eliminating the infinite 
Coulomb  self-energy,  and  effectively  rendering  the  mass  exclusively  non-electromagnetic.  In  this 
respect their end result is the same as herein: no self-action, no EM mass, no fundamental radiation 
reaction. The difference here is that there is no ‘re-introduction of mass’, no invocation of boundary 
conditions at infinity, and therefore no attempt to explain the emergence of radiation reaction at the 
level of observation.

where  the  dots  indicate  differentiation  with  respect  to  λ.  Equation (9)  can  be  solved  to  give  the 
proper  velocity  in  closed  form  -  in terms of the fields - suggesting that the massless particle has a 
unique and theoretically computable response to an applied field. 
  
The nodal surface constraint 
For  equation (9)  to  have  a  solution,  the  determinant  of  F  must  vanish,  apparently  imposing  a 
constraint on the fields themselves, rather than on the trajectory, giving

so ψ  is  constant  between  times  of  visitations  by  a  source;  if  a  location  is  never  visited,  it  remains 
constant for all time. Invoking the fiction that E and B are prescribed functions of space and time, it 
then  follows  that  the  particle  never  leaves  the  prescribed  nodal  surface  of  the  constant  function 
. Rather than a constraint on the fields, it is possible to regard 
which can now be written 

E.B

(

equation (11)  as  a  constraint  on  the  initial  conditions  (the  placement)  of  the  charge  source.  This 
condition may be anticipated immediately from equation (9), since it is the well-known condition to 
be  satisfied  by  the  fields  if  there  is  to  exist  a  frame  in  which  the  electric  field  is  zero.  In  an 
environment  of  arbitrary  field  variation,  equation  (11)  selects  the  sub-space  wherein  a  trajectory 
may conceivably see no electric field.  
 
Solution for the trajectory in terms of the fields 
Since equation (11) is required to be true for all λ-time along the trajectory, it must be true that all 
the derivatives, 

nd

d nψ λ , are zero. This means for n = 1 in particular that 
uκ

(13)

which  is  just  that  if  the  particle  is  to  remain  on  the  surface,  uκ  must  be  orthogonal  to  the  surface 
normal.  (Note that since E.B is a Lorentz invariant scalar, ψ(x) is a relativistic scalar field, because 
  is  a  4-
its  value  changes  only  in  response  to  transformations  of  the  coordinates.  As  a  result,  κψ∂
vector field.) Therefore uκ must be some anti-symmetric tensor times the gradient: 
 
T
=
whereupon the Lorentz force condition equation (9) becomes 
 

κψ∂
But if this equality is not to be a constraint on the fields on the nodal surface, it must either be an 
identity or another constraint on the initial condition. Noticing that if T is 
- the dual of F - then by 
virtue of the identity ([12])

equation (15), the vanishing Lorentz-force requirement, becomes

Interpretation 
Force and Motion 
The  particle  may  be  said  to  follow  the  instructions  of  the  EM  field  according  to  equation  (17).  By 
‘instructions’ rather than force, we draw attention  to the fact that the particle does not respond to 
force  in  the  traditional  sense  of  Newton’s  second  law.  Indeed,  its  motion  is  precisely  that  which 
causes  it  to  feel  no  force.  Yet  its  motion  is  nonetheless  still  uniquely  prescribed  by  the  (here 
misleadingly termed) ‘force-fields’ E and B. These fields still decide where the particle goes, just as 
the Lorentz force would decide where a massive particle goes. 
 
Power flow 
Whilst following the instructions of the EM field, the particle generates its own secondary fields as a 
result  of  its  motion  as  determined  by  the  usual  EM  formulae.  By  taking  the  scalar  product  of 
equation (10) with v, one finds that 
 

(
from  which  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  massless  charge  cannot  absorb  power  from  the  fields.  We 
will  not,  in  this  note,  try  to  decide  if  these fields either do, or do not, include advanced potentials.

However,  in  both  cases,  as  discussed  in  the  section  ‘No  self  action’,  at  this  pre-mass  level  of 
approximation  the  particle  cannot  radiate  energy  or  momentum.  Of  course,  if  the  system  were 
properly  closed,  one  could  not  arbitrarily  pre-specify  the  fields;  the  incident  and  secondary  fields 
would have to be self-consistent. 
 
Superluminality and time-reversals 
The  trajectory  given  by  equation (17)  is  not  constrained  by  light-speed,  nor  is  it  constrained  to  be 
time-monotonic.  For  t  to  be  a  monotonic  function  of  λ  requires  that  the  fields  conspire  to  keep

Gauge fixing 
Equation (17) does not have the correct dimensions to be a proper velocity. Further, it may be noted 
that  any  arbitrary  function  of  ψ  would  have  sufficed  for  the  operand  of  the  gradient,  since  its 
gradient would still be a four-vector field. Both these properties of equation (17) may be subsumed 
into  the  greater  one  that  uµ  as  specified  by  equation (9)  is  undetermined  by  at  least  an  arbitrary 
relativistic scalar field. This gauge freedom can be used to fix (or at least constrain) the value of u2, 
whilst  at  the  same  time  rendering  the  proper  velocity  dimensionless.  Accordingly,  let  us  write 
µα=(cid:4)
, where α is some relativistic scalar field, and uµ is just that in equation (17). Since  uµ  is a

4-vector field, any function of  u u

,  where  the  positive  sign  pertains  to  subluminal 

intervals, and the negative sign to superluminal intervals. The distinction is frame independent. Of 
course,  the  3-velocity  defined  in  equation (19)  is  unaffected  by  the  choice  of  gauge.  Time-reversals 
and  superluminal  speeds  preclude  the  identification  of  a  proper-time  monotonically  related  to 
laboratory time. 
 
Segmentation 
Conceptually at least, one may perform a piece-wise segmentation of the trajectory according to the 
angle of the vector  ( ,t x(cid:5) (cid:5) ) . By choosing the segment boundaries at the points of time reversal  t
0=(cid:5)
 
and  at  the  light-cone  crossings  t = x

(cid:5) ,  one  can  then  associate  the  sign  of  the  charge  with  the

(cid:5) would  distinguish 
direction  of  the  trajectory  in  time,  i.e.  with  sgn( t ),  whilst  the  sign  of  u
between  the  subluminal  pieces  (with  time-like  separated  intervals)  and  superluminal  pieces  (with 
space-like  separated  intervals).  Time-reversals  would  then  signify  pair-creation  and  destruction 
events. Charge would be conserved just because these events occur in (oppositely charged) pairs as 
entry and exit paths to and from the turning points. 
 
Charge field 
The picture that emerges from the above is that of a trajectory that is unconstrained in speed and 
direction in time in its efforts to ‘avoid’ the Lorentz force. As a result, the massless charge, precisely 
because  of  its  masslessness,  is  capable  of  crossing  its  own  light  cone,  and  reversing  in  time.  The 
former  connotes  a  potential  for  self-interaction  initially  denied  in  this  1st  order  model  of  a  single, 

 

5 

 

 
 
 

non-self-interacting  trajectory.  Depending  on  the  space-filling  density  of  the  trajectory,  the  latter 
suggests  that  the  final  result  of  the  twists  and  turns  of  the  trajectory  might  best  be  modeled  as  a 
continuous  charge-current  field  in  space  and  time.  Throughout  the  motion,  the  charge  will  emit 
radiation, which in a full - closed-system - treatment, should be the same function of space and time 
as the driving field. In any case, one is lead to predict an outcome wherein both charge and radiation 
fields are ubiquitous, reminiscent of QED. Similarly, one expects, at the next level of approximation, 
to have to deal with the attendant infinities in order to recover observable masses and charges.

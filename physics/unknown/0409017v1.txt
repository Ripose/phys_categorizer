Abstract 
 
Relationship  among  efficiency  and  output  power  of  heat-electric  energy 
converters  as  well  as  of  any  converters  for  transforming  of  heat  energy  into  any 
other kind of energy is considered. It is shown, that the parameter efficiency does 
not determine univocally the output power of a converter.  It is proposed to use an 
other parameter for determination of working ability of heat energy converters. It 
is shown,  that high output power can not be achieved by any kind of Stirling-type    
                                 converters in spite of their high efficiency. 

 
 
 
It has been historically automatically believed that a principal theoretical constraint for output 
power of low-energy-density heat-electric converters is the temperature gradient between the 
cooling  and  heating  parts  of  the  converter,  which  is  expressed  by  their  efficiency  equation:     
ηηηη = (Tinput-Toutput) / Tinput, where Tinput and Toutput are the temperatures of external media at 
the heater and cooler of a heat-electrical converter  respectively.  
 
Nevertheless the above mentioned historical belief is, in fact, a formal  misunderstanding. The 
efficiency  equation  does  not  determine  the  output  power,  but,  rather,    the  theoretically 
possible maximum of the efficiency as in Eoutput/Einput. This ratio of output and input energies 
does not take into account time t, and, therefore, does not determine the output power Poutput = 
Eoutput  /  t.  For  instance,  if  two  heat-electrical  converters  are  working  with  the  same 
temperature  gradient,  then  one  of  them  can  have  a  higher  efficiency,  but  a  lower  output 
power,  and    vice  versa.  The  key  consideration  here  is  how  quickly  the  converter  operates 
(which  does  not  only  depend  on  the  temperature  gradient).    Quick  conversion  also  helps  to 
minimize losses through dissipation.  
 
 
Let  us  consider  a  heat  –  electric  converter  (or  any  other  kind  of  converter,  which  one 
transforms a heat energy into an other kind of energy).

                                             N el out = Eel out  / t  
                                                            (output electrical power) 

 
 
Balance of the energy is:         E el out = E heat in - E heat out – E heat wastes 
Output electrical power is:     N el out =   Eel out  /  t                      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 

N el out = E heat in - E heat out – E heat wastes /  t  

 
therefore N el out can be maximised, if E heat wastes and  t will be minimised.

EXPRESSIONS  FOR  EFFICIENCY  η  AND   N el out  THROUGH  η : 

1)  Efficiency η can be maximised,  if the energy of heat wastes E heat wastes will be   
       minimised: 

               η = Eel out /E heat in = (E heat in - E heat out – E heat wastes ) / (E heat in)  

                                                                                                       

2) Output electrical power can be maximised, if :  

          

a)  Efficiency η will be maximised; 
b)  Time t of conversion will be minimised:  

 

 

N el out = (Eel out) / t = ( η x E heat in ) / t  = E heat in x ( η / t ) 

 
Conditions a) and b) for (η) and (t) are independent one from another. Theoretically and 
technically the variants are possible, when a converter with the lower efficiency η has 
the higher output electrical power N el out  dependently of the value of time t:  
                                    

N el out = E heat in x ( η / t )

(here E heat in is the supplied to the converter heat energy; E heat out is the abstracted from the 
converter heat energy (physically necessary heat loss); E heat wastes is the heat energy of heat 
wastes (physically not-necessary heat loss); Eel out is the output electrical energy of the 
converter; t is the time; and N el out is the output electrical power of the converter). 
 
 
Additional general notes: 
 
It is necessary to note, that in the case of fossil energy sources the efficiency η really plays a 
decided  role,  because  it  determines  how  much  energy  from  the  burned  energy-carrier 
substance  (fuel)  will  be  utilised.  But  in  the  case  of  renewable  heat  energy  sources  finally  it 
does not matter  how much energy of  a source will be loss, because there is no prise for the 
energy-carrier substance and there is no pollutions. Therefore efficiency η plays a role as far 
as  it  influence  on  the  output  power.  (If  energy  losses  during  the  energy  conversion  will  be 
reduced,  the  output  power  will  increase).    But  as  it  was  shown  above,  it  is  only  one  of 
parameters, but not the sole one, and not the main one. 
 
Parameter η (efficiency) does not determine a workingability, technically and commercially, 
of  the  heat-electrical  converter  adequately.  It  is  necessary  to  propose  an  other  parameter  to 
describe it’s effectiveness.  It is proposed to use a parameter (coefficient) 
 

l = Noutput  / ΔT 
 
that is a ratio of output power Noutput of a converter to the input temperature difference ΔT 
to  describe  the  working  characteristics  of  a  renewable  heat  energy  converters  instead  of  the 
parameter η (efficiency) .  
 
In  fact  both  efficiency  and  velocity  of  energy  conversion  are  taken  into  account  by  this 
parameter.  
 
Therewith  if  this  parameter  (coefficient)  is  named  for  a  converter,  an  output  power  of  this 
converter by any of input temperature differences is determined. 
 
Conclusion 1:  
Parameter  η  (efficiency)  does  not  determine  the  output  power  of  a  converter  univocally. 
Theoretically  and  technically  the  variants  are  possible,  when  a  converter  with  the  lower 
efficiency η  has  the  higher  output  electrical  (or  other  non-heat)  power N  el  out   , or  when 
two converters with the same efficiency η have different output electrical (or other non-heat)  
powers N el out   
 
Conclusion 2 :  
Parameter η (efficiency) does not determine adequately a workingability and utility of a heat- 
electrical  converter  (or  any  converter,  which  transforms  a  heat  energy  into  other  form  of

energy).  It  is  proposed  to  use  a  parameter  (coefficient)   “l  = Noutput   / ΔT”    (Ratio  of 
output  power  of  a  converter  to  the  input  temperature  difference)    to  describe  the  working 
characteristics of a renewable heat energy converters instead of the parameter η (efficiency) . 
___________________________________________________________________________ 
 
The  above-described  theoretical  matter  lead  to  one  direct  practical  consequence:  it  is 
principally impossible to build any kind of Stirling – motor with high output power in spite of 
it’s high efficiency. It is possible to essentially increase it’s efficiency, but it will not lead to 
the creation of a practically applicable converter with high output power.   
 
In fact, physically, the action of Stirling-motors is based on a slow absorption of heat energy 
by  a  slowly  extending  gas.  The  amount  of  energy  absorbed  and  converted  by  the  Stirling-
motor  in  a  unite  of  time  is  very  small,  and  therefore  it’s  output  power  is  very  low  too. 
Efficiency is not an exhaustive  parameter to describe effectiveness of the converter of energy, 
if there is no specification how much time spend this converter to convert a given amount of 
energy (or specification about it’s output power).  
 
Efficiency ηηηη of the converter of energy is, as it is known, a ratio between it’s input and output 
powers NIN and NOUT or the ratio between supplied and converted energies ЕIN and ЕOUT. . 
Because power N is energy Е in a unit of time t (N =Е/t), efficiency is calculated as: ηηηη = 
NIN / NOUT = (NIN * t) / (NOUT * t) where NIN and ЕIN are the input power and energy, 
and NOUT and ЕOUT are the output power and energy on the output of the converter. Time t  
is  both  in  a  numerator  and  in  a  denominator,  and  is  therefore  cancelled.  Thus,  efficiency η η η η 
does not define time for which the given amount of energy was converted, but only how much 
energy was lost during this conversion. That is the generators converting some energy for 
1 minute and for 1 hour can have identical rated efficiency. (Previous publication of this 
matter  took  place  in  [ISBN  3-8288-1255-4,  "Erneuerbare  Energiequellen:  Komplex  von 
Technischen  Losungen  ",  A.Luchinski;  Tectum  -  Wissenschaftsverlag,  Marburg,  2002]; 
germ.). 
 
Conclusion:  Output  power  of  Stirling-motors  is  very  low,  despite  of  high  rated  efficiency. 
This efficiency is normally calculated as a ratio between the converted output energy and the 
supplied input energy without taking into account time spent for this conversion. 
 
 
It is necessary to note two significant  factual circumstances:   

1)  In  despite  of  the  formally  higher  then  in  photovoltaical  converters  efficiency,  the 
Stirling converters are not used as the house-roof sun converters for electricity house-
supply instead of PV-panels; 

2)  Already  now  the  efficiency  of  presently  created  Stirling  motors  much  more  higher 
then  the  efficiency of  internal-combustion engines (according to some publications a 
level  of  50%  and  even  more  efficiency  for  Stirling-motors  is  achieved).  But  nobody 
substitutes the internal-combustion engines with Stirling-motors, because the Stirling-
motors have much lower output power in despite of higher efficiency.  

 
The above presented consideration explains the reason of these facts and the matter of the 
presently taking place formal misunderstanding.

Conclusions : 

 
 
 
1.  Efficiency-parameter  does  not  determine  the  output  power  of  a  converter  univocally. 
Theoretically  and  experimentally  the  variants  are  possible,  when  a  converter  with  the  lower 
efficiency has the higher output electrical (or other non-heat) power, or when two converters 
with the same efficiency have different output electrical (or other non-heat)  powers. 
 
2.  Parameter η  (efficiency)  does  not  determine  adequately  a  workingability  and  utility  of  a 
heat- electrical converter (or any converter, which transforms a heat energy into other form of 
energy).  It  is  proposed  to  use  a  parameter  (coefficient)   “l  = Noutput   / ΔT”    (Ratio  of 
output  power  of  a  converter  to  the  input  temperature  difference)    to  describe  the  working 
characteristics of a renewable heat energy converters instead of the parameter η (efficiency) . 
 
3.  As essential as one likes increasing of an efficiency of the Stirling-type converters through 
any kind of technical solutions can not lead to the essential increasing of their output power.  
It is principally impossible to build a Stirling-motor with high output power, also regardless 
of  it’s  efficiency,  as  long  as  it’s  action  is  based  on  a  slow  absorption  of  heat  energy  by  a 
slowly extending gas.

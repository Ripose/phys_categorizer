Abstract.  The  paper  presents  formulation  and  solution  for  the  problem  of  determination  of  spatial 
spectrum  of  artificial  ionospheric  irregularities  from  vertical  HF  radio  sounding  data  on  anomalous 
attenuation. The suggested method uses the dependence of  extraordinary wave attenuation caused by 
multiple scattering from the irregularities on frequency to obtain the spectrum parameters. The method 
is applied to the data obtained in experiments with Sura heating facility carried out on September 6-9, 
1999. 

Introduction 

The main purpose of the ionosphere radio sounding is to determine the structure of the medium 
from the characteristics of the reflected signal. The formulation of corresponding inverse problem is 
well-known  for  determination  of  the  ionosphere  regular  properties  (like  the  altitude  dependence  of 
e hν
) from the vertical or oblique sounding data. The 
( )
electron density 
inverse problem in this case is reduced to solving of Fredholm or Volterra type integral equations.

Diagnostics  of  spatial  spectrum  of  random  ionospheric  irregularities  from  parameters  of  the 
sounding signal is connected with solving of the inverse problem also. One of the signal characteris-
tics that can be used for this purpose is non-collisional attenuation caused by multiple scattering. Ac-
cording to the theory of this effect, under conditions typical for non-disturbed mid-latitude ionosphere 
the anomalous attenuation magnitude may reach 10 dB and more [Zabotin et al., 1998]. In the present 
paper we consider the frequency dependence of anomalous attenuation as the input parameter for the 
inverse problem of the irregularity spectrum determination. 

The essential peculiarity of formulation of the inverse problem in the case of the diagnostics of 
random ionospheric irregularities is the complexity of direct problem. The solution of the direct prob-
lem depends upon various parameters of the irregularity spectrum and propagation geometry. And this 
dependence  is  rather  complex.  This  complexity  does  not  allow  to  formulate  the  inverse  problem  in  
analytic form, for example,  as a system of differential or integral equations. In this case to solve the 
inverse  problem  means  to  find  such  parameters  of  the  model  of  radio waves  propagation in random 
medium which give the best (in the sense of certain norm in functional space) fit of experimental data. 
Let us suggest that  exp( )

The matter of direct problem in this case is determination of spatial-angular distribution of ra-
diation reflected from the ionospheric layer for given regular parameters of the layer (electron density 
profile, etc.) and given parameters of spatial spectrum of irregularities. For the case of vertical sound-
ing the dependence of signal attenuation L on frequency is used as input experimental data.  

This approach to solving of inverse problem for radio sounding of irregular ionospheric layer 

was suggested and tested on experimental data in  [Bronin et al, 1999].

In the present paper we describe application of this method to diagnostics of artificial irregu-

larities for the case of extraordinary sounding wave. 

In  Section  1  we  describe  the  method  of  direct  problem  solving.  The  formulation  of  inverse 

problem is discussed in Section 2. Experimental data and obtained results are discussed in Section 3.

 on the certain base plane which is paral-
lel to the layer. It is natural to choose the surface of the Earth as the base plane for the case of iono-
spheric propagation. The spatial and angular distribution  0( ,
 of radiation energy reflected from 
the ionosphere is described by the radiation balance equation (RBE)  [Zabotin et al., 1998]:

model  parameters 

As  it  was  explained  in  Introduction,  to  solve  the  inverse  problem  means  to  find  such  set  of

Therefore we have a classical nonlinear least squares problem. The methods of numeric solv-
ing of nonlinear least squares problem are well developed [Dennis and Schnabel, 1983]. Realizations 
of  these  methods  are  available  through  various  numeric  analysis  libraries  such  as,  for  example, 
MINPACK [More et al., 1980]. 

Now we need to  determine  the model of random irregularity spectrum to make our model of 
propagation  in  the  ionosphere  complete.  Let  us  suppose  that  the  irregularities  in  the  given  band  of 
scales are strongly stretched along the lines of geomagnetic field force and let us characterize them by 
the spectrum of the following form

sphere. For the case of vertical sounding of plane-stratified ionosphere it is naturally to consider that

The  above model of  the spectrum is  not quite  adequate neither for artificial irregularities nor 
for natural. The real spectra are known do demonstrate different behavior for different ranges of wave 
numbers  [Szuszczewicz,  1987;  Frolov  et  al., 1996]. Real spectrum  of artificial irregularities, for ex-
ample, is known to have a hump in the range of scale 0.5 - 1 km. In this paper we do not intend to pro-
vide  ultimate  diagnostic  procedure,  taking  into  account  numerous  peculiarities  of  real  irregularity 
spectra, electron density profile, etc. However, the valuable results may be obtained using the simple 
model of the above spectrum described. 

3. Application to experimental data 

The experiments with the Sura heating facility were carried out on the 6th, the 7th and the 9th 
of September, 1999 in the evening or night hours of the local time when absorption in the ionosphere 
D-region is small and may be neglected. Heating was provided by synchronous work of three 250 kW 
transmitters. With account of antenna gain the effective transmitted power was 300 MW. The period 
of each heating cycle was 5 minutes and the pause between cycles was 10 minutes. In the experiment 
on the 6th of September, 1999 the heating was performed by the high-power HF wave of ordinary po-
larization at the frequency 5,752 MHz. The attenuation of the probe wave was measured at frequencies 
4.069, 4.669, 5.669, 6.069, 6.269, 6.424 and 6.849  MHz. In the experiment at the 7th of September 

 
4 
the  extraordinary  heating  wave  with  the  frequency  7,815  MHz  was used. Attenuation  measurements 
were made at 8.024, 7.789, 7.624, 7.224, 6.624, 5.424 MHz. In the experiment of the 9th of September 
the attenuation was measured at frequencies 4.469, 4.969, 5.369, 5.569, 5.769, 5.969 and 6.169 MHz. 
In each case the attenuation was measured for the extraordinary waves. Diagnostic waves were emit-
ted as a pulses with duration of 100 microseconds and with linear polarization. The reflected signals 
were received by  the  antenna  tuned  for extraordinary  polarization  with 10  dB separation of ordinary 
wave.  During  the  heating  experiment  the  profile  of  electron  density  was  checked  with  the  oblique 
sounding with linear FM signals at the path Yoshkar Ola – N. Novgorod. 

The  primary  data  sets  (records  of  amplitude  for  seven  frequencies  )  were  averaged  over  the 
heating cycles. The averaged curves were divided into 4 different parts. The first part corresponds to 
the state before the beginning of the heating, when only natural irregularities are present in the iono-
sphere.  The  second  part  corresponds  to  the  period  of  anomalous  attenuation  development.  The third 
part  corresponds  to  saturated  state  when  both  natural  and  artificial  irregularities  are  present  and  the 
fourth part corresponds to relaxation of artificial irregularities after the turning off the heating facility. 
The fitting was applied for each of them independently. Linear fits were used to determine saturated 
amplitudes before and after the beginning of the heating, while exponential fits were used to estimate 
the development and relaxation times of the phenomena. This method was used to obtain the depend-
encies of the anomalous attenuation on frequency of the probe wave (Fig. 1). It should be noted, that 
we determine relative attenuation of wave amplitude  RL , i.e. the ratio of the amplitude before the be-
ginning  of  the  heating  to  the  amplitude  after  the  beginning  of  the  heating  calculated  in  decibels  as

The observed attenuation of extraordinary waves (probe waves in all series of measurements as 
well as pump wave at the 7-th of September) is considerably large. Multiple scattering from irregulari-
ties within the range of scales 100 m – 5 km  is the only known mechanism which can explain it. Thus 
the significance of the obtained data is that they clearly demonstrate the existence of strong anomalous 
attenuation  of  extraordinary  waves  in  heating  experiments  as  well  as  that  they  indirectly  prove  the 
conclusions of multiple scattering theory.

The information available from our data sets is not enough for determination of all irregularity 
spectrum parameters simultaneously. Let us assign to  0l ⊥  and  ν  rather typical values:   0

δ  on the altitude. We need to determine also the 
and  
model  of  natural  irregularities  which  determines  background  anomalous  attenuation.  Let  us  suppose

pose that heating of ionosphere results only in the change of altitude distribution, while the type of the 
spectrum is not changed. In this case the quantity   0

quantity  P(cid:4) .

Since we need to determine only one parameter of spectrum  δ  one may simplify calculations 
and reduce the solution of inverse problem to the solution of direct problem. Real electron density pro-
file, determined from the ionosphere sounding data, was approximated by parabolic profile with rea-
sonable accuracy.  For  each  frequency  of    probe  waves  this profile was  replaced by  equivalent linear 
profile, determined from condition of equality of derivatives of the electron density over an altitude at 
reflection point. The attenuation of probe waves was calculated using formulae (6) and (7) for a grid of 
values of   δ .  Two  values  of  δ  from the grid, giving attenuation closest to experimental value were 
used  to  start  dichotomy  process,  giving  the  value  of  δ  with required accuracy. This process was re-

peated  for  various  values  of  background  irregularities  amplitude  0
presented at Fig. 3 - 5. In this approach we replace the real ionospheric profile of electron density with 
the equivalent linear profiles different for different sounding frequencies. Such replacement does not 
cause significant error in determination of altitude dependence of  δ because the main contribution into 
anomalous  attenuation  comes  from  the region near the point of reflection for given frequency where 
the linear approximation gives the best fit of real profile. Other method of calculations is to use linear 
or parabolic approximation of altitude dependence of  δ  and find the coefficients of  approximation by 
solving the least squares problem. The results of the calculations for parabolic approximation are pre-
δ  is 
sented at Fig. 6 - 8. At Fig. 9 - 11 anomalous attenuation determined from restored profile of  R
compared with experimental values. 

As it was mentioned above, the model of irregularity spectrum is rather simple and does not re-
flect  all  peculiarities  of  real  spectra  of  natural  or  artificial  irregularities.  In  particular,  one  may  take 
into account the increase of irregularity level near the point of reflection of pump wave by the simple 
modification of irregularity altitude profile model

the data of the 7th of September. Corresponding results are presented at Fig. 12, 13. It may be noted 
that account for the "hump" at the height of reflection of pump wave results in better approximation of 
frequency  dependence  of  anomalous  attenuation.  Restoration  of  altitude  profile  of  δ   for  both  para-
bolic and parabolic with a hump models for  September, 7 data demonstrates important peculiarity of 
the method. In both cases calculations give a negative values of   δ  for altitude in several points. It is 
caused  by  using  non-uniform  grid  of  frequencies  and  a  relatively  short  set  of  sounding  frequencies 
used  in  experiment.  This  problem  may  be  solved  by  addition  of  new  points  using  the  interpolation 
procedure.  Using  of  tight  grid  of  frequencies  makes  such  deviations  not  possible  (see  Fig.  13).  The 
other method is to divide the whole interval of altitudes into regions within which anomalous attenua-
tion is a monotonous function as it was done in [Bronin et al., 1999]. 

Conclusion 

The main result obtained in the paper is demonstration of possibility of using of the anomalous 
attenuation  measurements  data  for  the  purpose  of  diagnostics  of  artificial  ionospheric  irregularities.  
The solution of the inverse problem was performed in the simplified form which is determined by the 
nature of experimental data and calculation difficulties in realization of more sophisticated approach to 
inverse  problem  solution.  Such  approach  demands,  in  particular,  measurements  on  a  very  tight  and 
uniform  grid  of  frequencies  or  interpolation  of  the  data.  In  our  calculations  we used  the  data on the 
anomalous attenuation of an extraordinary wave, because it is not affected by the anomalous absorp-
tion what makes possible to determine pure effect of scattering. The other reason is that existing ex-
perimental set is not able to measure anomalous attenuation for waves of both polarizations simulta-
neously. Simultaneous measurements of  anomalous attenuation of ordinary and extraordinary waves 
would make it possible to separate contributions from anomalous absorption and scattering and thus to 
estimate the shape of spectrum for different scales of irregularities.

Abstract.  We  present  a  multifractal  analysis  of  Mount  St.  Helens  seismic  time  distribution during  1980-
2002. The seismicity distribution is studied in connection to the eruptive activity, mainly marked by the 1980 
major  explosive  eruptions,  and  the  1980-1986  dome  building  eruptions.  The  spectrum  of  generalized 
dimensions  Dq  extracted,  allows  us  to  identify  two  main  earthquake  time-distribution  patterns.    The  first  
exhibits a multifractal clustering correlated to the intense seismic swarms of the dome building activity.  The 
second one is characterized by an almost constant value of Dq ≈1, as for a random homogeneous distribution,  
and  is  related  to  the  regional  or  tectonic  seismic  activity.    The  time  evolution  of  Dq,  calculated  on  a  fixed 
number of events window and at different depths, shows that the brittle mechanical response of the shallow 
layers to rapid magma intrusions during the eruptive periods is revealed by sharp changes and by the lowest 
values of Dq (≈0.3) acting at a short time scale (order of days).  Conversely, for deeper earthquake foci, the 
Dq do not show obvious changes during the whole period analyzed  suggesting that the earthquakes related to 
the deep magma supply system are characterized by a minor degree of clustering, which is independent of the 
eruptive activity.   
 

1. Introduction  

Earthquakes space-time distributions exhibit fractal properties that can be a consequence of 

a  self-organized  critical  state  of  the  earth  crust,  analogous  for  instance  to  the  state  of  a 

sandpile that spontaneously evolves to a critical angle of repose in response to the steady 

supply  of  new  grains  at  the  summit  (Bak,  1998;  Jensen  1998,  Turcotte  1999).  The  self-

similar  nature  of  seismicity  in  space  and  time  is  then  an  indication  of  the  hierarchical 

structure of the clustering, intimately linked to a diffusion of the stress in the earth’s crust. 

Consequently, the numerical extraction of the fractal dimensions of real seismic data is an 

important  method  to  quantify  the  distribution  of  seismic  events  and  with  that,  the 

properties of randomness and clusterization of a given geographical region. In particular, 

considering  the  evolutionary  aspect,  the  study  of  the  temporal  variations  in  the  spatial 

fractal  dimension  can  show  how  the  global  scaling  relations,  namely  the  space  scale 

 

 

 

invariance,    changes  in  time  (Rossi,  1990;  Radulian  and  Trifu,  1991;  De  Rubeis  et  al., 

1993;1997;  Legrand  et  al.,  1996).  The  time  evolution  of  the  fractal  dimension  provides 

more  information  than  simpler  analysis,  as  for  example  the  variation  of  the  number  of 

events  inside  a  fixed  time  window,  being  able  to  distinguish  and  characterize  seismic 

patterns  acting  at  different  time  scales.    In  particular,  in  volcanic  environments  time 

variations of time-space fractal dimensions and b-value have been interpreted in terms of 

rapid changes of the physical state of the volcano edifice acting at mid (order of months) 

and short-term (order of days) scales (Gresta and Patanè, 1983; Patanè et al., 1992; Latora 

et  al.,  1998;  Vinciguerra,  1999;2002).    Nevertheless,  recent  studies  suggest  that 

multifractal laws, rather than simple monofractal ones, are necessary to explain the scale-

related complexity observed in earthquake distributions and their time evolution (Legrand 

et al., 1996; Dimitriu et al., 2000; Telesca et al., 2002).  

In the present work we study the multifractal properties of the Mount St. Helens volcano 

seismicity  distribution  during  the  period  1980-2002.  Since  we  are  dealing  with  a  very 

limited  spatially  region  (a  few  kilometers),  we  focus  on  the  time  distribution  of  seismic 

events,  which  is  the  most  important  marker  of  the  changes  of  the  physical  state  of  the 

volcano. We therefore present an analysis aiming at  defining how the properties of seismic 

time  clustering  evolve  in  time  with  respect  to:  1)  eruptive  and  different  phases  of  dome 

building  activity;  2)  relative  quiescence  phases  of  the  volcano;  3)  different  depths  of 

crustal  volumes,  whose  mechanical  behavior  is  controlled  by  the  interplay  of  regional 

tectonic and magma stresses.  We extract the generalized fractal dimensions from the time 

sequences  and  discuss  how  the  multifractal  formalism  is  a  well  suited  tool  for  volcanic 

areas in which multiple processes act.  

2. Mount St. Helens volcanism and seismicity 

Mount  St.  Helens,  Washington,  is  the  most  active  volcano  in  the  Cascade  Range.  The 

volcano awakened in the spring of 1980 with an intense swarm of earthquakes, that began 

in  mid-March  (Malone,  1990)  a  series  of  phreatic  eruptions  beginning  on  March  27  and 

rapid northward deformation of the north flank of the volcano beginning no later than early 

April.  By May 17 more than 10,000 earthquakes had occurred, including a magnitude 4.2 

earthquake  on  March  20,  and  the  north  flank  of  the  volcano  had  grown  outward  at  least 

140 meters.  The vast majority of the located hypocentres were shallow (h<3km). Seismic 

data are from the University of Washington catalogue of located earthquakes (Fig.1 reports 

 

 

 

the daily distribution).  On the morning of May 18, a magnitude-5.1 earthquake caused a 

huge landslide that triggered a cataclysmic lateral blast destroying everything up to thirty 

kilometres  north  of  the  volcano.    A  plinian  eruption  producing  pyroclastic  flows  and 

volcanic mudflows (lahars) occurred in the following hours.  From May 25 to October 16 

five  smaller  explosive  episodes  occurred,  producing  eruption  columns  and  pyroclastic 

flows.  After the  May 18 plinian eruption  earthquakes  were  much  smaller  than  before  it. 

Following each explosive eruption a deep (h>4Km) suite of earthquakes occurred decaying 

like an aftershock sequence.   

The  character  of  the  seismicity  and  eruption  patterns  changed  dramatically  after  the 

explosive  eruption  of  October,  1980.    Primarily  episodic  dome-building  eruptions  took 

place  from  October  1980  to  1986,  each  preceded  by  a  precursory  swarm  of  earthquakes 

and minor deformation within the crater.  The most significant seismic swarm preceded a 

minor explosive eruption followed by dome growth in March, 1982.  It is remarkable that 

there was a slight gap of hypocenter depths between 3 and 5Km with a concentration from 

events between 6 and 11Km and a few larger events extending below that.  A 12-month-

long  dome-building  episode  beginning  in  spring,  1983  included  several  periods  of 

increased seismicity.  

After  the  end  of  dome-building  eruptions  in  October,  1986  seismicity  at  St.  Helens 

decreased  considerably  through  1989.    Significant  shallow  (Z<3km)  seismicity  has  been 

mostly absent since then.  Starting in 1989 persistent patterns of deeper earthquakes cluster 

in  the  4-10km  zone.    Between  1989  and  1991  a  number  of  swarms  of  deeper  seismic 

activity  accompanied  small  steam  explosions  from  the  dome.    Overall  seismicity  in  the 

shallow,  2-4km  zone  is  of  low  levels  and  not  concentrated  in  time.    Since  1991  no 

explosions have occurred and seismicity in the 0-2km zone is almost absent.  The 2-4Km 

deep  zone  has  persistent  low  level  of  earthquakes.    Episodes  of  significantly  increased 

seismicity occurred in both 1995 and 1998, primarily in the deeper zone of 4 to 8km depth.  

The increased deep seismicity around 1989-1991, in 1995 and in 1998 has been interpreted 

based  on  focal  mechanisms  as  being  caused  by  stress  release  on  very  local  faults  and 

fractures due to magma refilling the crustal magma chamber (Musumeci et. al., 2002).  

3. Generalized  Multifractal Dimensions 

The  fractal  dimension  is  the  basic  concept  to  describe  structures  having  a  scaling 

symmetry.  Scaling  symmetry  means  self-similarity  of  the  considered  object  on  varying 

scales of magnification.  The historically first definition of dimension, providing a measure 

 

 

for  filling  space  which  allows  for  the  possibility  of  non-integral  dimensions,  was 

introduced  by  Hausdorff  in  late  1919.    The  capacity-dimension  Dc  of  a  given  geometric 

object (set), also called the box-counting dimension, is defined in the following way. We 

first  perform  a  partition  of  the  space  occupied  by  the  object  into  equally  sized  d-

dimensional cubes with edge size ε, and then we count the minimum number of cubes N(ε) 

required to cover the set. DC is a measure of how N(ε) scales with ε:

Such a measure, only based on the number of occupied boxes, does not take into account 

the possibility of having fractal regions with different density.  In general, to characterize 

completely  a  distribution,  or  to  distinguish  between  two  distributions  quantitatively,  we 

need to compare the different  moments of  the distribution.  In a similar way the geometry 

of  the  fractal  object  under  study  is  better  characterized  by  means  of  an  infinite  set  of 

generalized fractal dimensions.  

1983; Hilborn 2000) are defined by:

under  study),

very  particular  case  of  an  object  with  equal  probabilities  for  all  the  cells,  named  a 

monofractal, we have Dq = D0 for all q.  

In  this  paper  we  have  computed  the  generalized  fractal  dimensions  Dq  of  the  time 

distribution of earthquakes.  In practice the series  x(i),i 1,..., M

 is given by t(i), i=1,…,M

i.e. by the time occurrence of the M earthquakes.   

4. Data analysis and Discussion 

We consider Mount St. Helens seismicity during the period 1980-2002 (Fig.1).  Two main 

phases can be distinguished in terms of volcanic activity: the 1980-1986 eruptive period, 

which includes the cataclysmic May 18, 1980 and  1981-1986  dome building period, and 

the 1987-2002 period with no eruptive activity, but only a few very small steam explosions 

in the winter 1989-1990, 1991 characterized by the absence of juvenile material.   

Multifractal spectrum seismicity for eruptive and non-eruptive periods 

In fig.2a we report the spectrum of the generalized dimensions Dq obtained for the eruptive 

and  for  the  non-eruptive  period.  In  the  case  of  the  eruptive  period  (1980-1986), 

characterized by intense volcanological activity, the spectrum clearly indicate that the time 

distribution  of  earthquakes  shows  a  multifractal  structure  with  generalized  dimensions 
ranging  from  Dq∼0.36  for  q → ∞   ,  to      Dq  ∼1.0  for    q → −∞  

  .  This  fact  indicates  the 

q → −∞

presence of  strong clustering with regions of different density in the time distribution.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Conversely, when Dq are computed for the non eruptive period (1987-2002), we measure a 
≤  , indicating a smaller range and higher values.  This suggests 

spectrum of   0.7

1

qD≤

that  seismicity  is  distributed  more  uniformly  and  is  closer  to  a  random  sequence  with 

respect  to  the  eruptive  case.    It  is  important  to  observe  that,  by  using  the  spectrum  of 

generalized  dimensions  we  can  better  discriminate  between  eruptive  and  non  eruptive 

periods than by means of D0 only (in fact we have D0 =0.97 and  D0 =0.87  for the non-

eruptive and eruptive periods respectively).  One could also have objects with the same D0 

but different spectra.  So in general, one should always prefer a multifractal analysis to a 

simple calculation of  the box-counting dimension in order to characterize in a unique and 

quantitative way  a multifractal object (Hilborn 2000). 

Multifractal analysis of artificial sequences. 

In order to better understand the results of our analysis we have computed the spectrum of 

generalized  dimensions  for  two  artificially  generated  distributions.    The  first  artificial  

sequence was obtained by randomly distributing the same number of earthquakes present 

in the non eruptive period.  The second one refers to a well known multifractal object, the 

so-called weighted Cantor set, a typical multifractal set obtained by dividing a segment of 

length  1  into  smaller  and  smaller  segments  using  two  different  probabilities  p1=0.7  and 

p2=0.3      (see  Hilborn  2000  p.400  for  more  details).  Fig.2c  shows  that  the  results  are 

perfectly  compatible  with  the  behavior  obtained  for  the  non-eruptive  and  eruptive  period 

respectively.    In  particular  the  random  distribution  does  not  give  exactly  Dq=1  for  all  q, 

because  of  the  finiteness  of  the  sample,  but  reproduce  the  shape  observed  in  the  non 

eruptive case.  This reinforces our claim that the seismic activity is randomly distributed in 

time when no eruptive activity is present, while the seismic activity is clustered in time (as 

in a  multifractal set)  when an eruptive process in active. 

 Time evolution analysis of the fractal dimensions 

Time  evolution  of  the  multifractal  spectrum  was  investigated  in  order  to  identify  and/or 

distinguish seismic patterns acting at different time scales.  We adopted a moving window 

of 250 events with an overlap of 50 events.  Such a window, chosen after several attempts, 

guarantees  a  satisfactory  compromise  between  statistics  and  sensitivity  to  the  eruptive 

activity.    We  report  in  fig.  3b  the  results  of  this  analysis  for  the  dimensions  D2  and  D0.  

Both  of  them  show  sharp  changes  acting  at  short  time  scales  (order  of  months  or  days) 

related  to  the  eruption  period,  1980-1986  (fig3a).    This  behavior,  controlled  mainly  by 

   

 

 

intense seismic swarms related to the dome-building activity, induce a large variability in 
qD (≈0.3-0.4) marking high values of 

the multifractal spectrum, with the lowest values of 

fractal clustering.  The increase of the  

qD   spectrum width seems to be controlled by the 

largest eruptions in terms of volume of magma emitted (Branteley, 2000).  This can be due 

to  the  brittle  response  of  the  medium  by  means  of  intense  seismic  swarms  during  the 

transfer  of  large  volumes  of  magma  in  the  shallower  portion  of  the  crust.    Conversely, 

minor eruptive episodes and intra-eruptive periods are marked by a general increase of  

qD  

towards  higher  values  indicating  a  less  clustered  behavior  of  seismicity.    The 

qD     time 

evolution  is  much  more  stable  (0.7<  D0,2<0.9)  during  1987-2002,  where  only  a  sharp 
decrease  occurred  in  1991  (D2∼0.5),  which  can  be  due  to  the  seismicity  related  to  small 

explosions from the dome.  The major implication is that this period is mostly controlled 

by  the  ‘background’  seismic  activity,  i.e.  the  regional  or  tectonic  seismic  activity,  which 

shows  a  much  more  stable  behavior,  tending  towards  a  random  distribution  as  shown  in 

fig.2.    

Depth analysis of seismicity 

Finally,  we  measure  the  time  evolution  of  fractal  dimensions  as  a  function  of  varying 

depth.  On the basis of seismo-tectonic and volcanological consideration (Malone, 1991), 

two  main  crustal  volumes  below  St.  Helens  are  considered.    The  first  located  between  0 

and 4 Km made of low-strength volcanic rocks, which fracture due to magma pressure as it 

transits between a deeper reservoir and the volcanic vent.  The second located between 4 

and 10 Km is mostly related to regional or tectonic stresses perhaps modified by magma 

pressure  within  the  mid-crustal  magma  chamber.    Magma  may  move  into  zone  2  from  a 

deep source slowly and perhaps continuously (Malone, 1991) with pulses or increased flow 

from  time  to  time  (Musumeci,  2002).    Dq  calculated  for  the  0<h<4km  shows  the  same 

trend reported in fig.3, evidencing high variability during 1980-1986 where the lowest Dq 
values (≈0.3) are found and a more stable trend during 1987-2002 (0.7< Dq<0.9).  This is a 

further  confirmation  that  large  fluctuations  of  Dq  are  induced  by  the  brittle  mechanical 

response  of  the  shallow  layers  to  rapid  magma  intrusions  marking  eruption  onset. 

Conversely,  when  Dq  are  calculated  for  deeper  earthquake  foci  (h>4km),  no  apparent 

change over time, during and after the eruptive periods, are observed.  This implies that the 

 

 

 

earthquakes related to the deep magma supply system are characterized by a monofractal 

almost random structure, which is independent from eruptive activity.   

5. Conclusions 

We  have  shown  that  the  changes  of  the  volcanic  activity  observed  at  Mt.  St.  Helens 

volcano  can  be  characterized  quantitatively  by  considering  the  spectrum  of  generalized 

dimensions  Dq.  More  precisely,  during  the  eruptive  period  1980-1986  we  have  a 

characteristic multifractal clustering with Dq spanning  a range [1.,0.4], while  during the 

non eruptive period 1987-2002 we obtain a range [1.,0.7] much less clustered.  

. A finer analysis performed by calculating the generalized dimension  Dq in time moving 

windows has revealed a clear correlation between a sharp time variability of D0 and D2 and 

the  major  eruptions  occurrence.  On  the  other  hand  during  the  following  non-eruptive 

period an almost constant  behaviour with  

D D≈

0

2

≈

±
0.8 0.2

 is found.  Such values are 

consistent  with  a  random  signal,  considering  the  small  value  of  events  in  the  moving 

window.  

Time  evolution  calculated  with  respect  to  depth  reveals  that  Dq  variability  is  peculiar  of 

shallow  crust  volumes  (0<h<4km),  probably  induced  by    the  mechanical  response  to 

magma  intrusions,  while  the  deeper  seismicity  is  characterized  by  a  monofractal  almost 

random  structure, which is independent from the eruptive activity.

a)  The spectrum of generalized dimensions

 is reported for the two periods of the database: the eruptive one 1980-

1986 (full triangles) and the non eruptive one 1987-2002 (squares) . A clear multifractal structure emerges only 
for    the eruptive period

b)  The  spectrum  of  generalized  dimensions  for  1)  an  artificial  multifractal  set,  the  weighted  Cantor  set    (with  
p1=0.7 and p2= 0.3, see Hilborn 2000 p.400)  (full circles), and 2) a random distribution of 1700 events in a 
  Dq  should  all  be  equal  to  1  and  the  observed 
period  of  10  years  (empty  circles).  In  the  latter  case  the

discrepancy  is  due  only  to  fine  size  effects.  This  result  support  our  claim  that  in  the  period  1992-2002  no 
fractal clustering is present and the small change in Dq is due only to finite size effects

a)    We  report    the  eruptions  occurred  in  the  period  studied.  Bars  indicate  the  magma  volume  erupted  in  million 
cubic yards. 
b)  Here  we  plot  the  generalized  dimension  D0    and  D2  calculated  for  a  moving  window  in  the  time  sequence 
consisting of 250 events with a shift of 50 events. In the eruptive period a close correlation between rapid changes 
in the value of the two dimensions with the major eruption is clearly visible.  The time evolution of the dimensions 
become smother after the dome-building activity period.

The modern form of the Saint-Venant − Wantzel’s formula for an outflow velocity of gas 
stream from flowing element is submitted. Taking into account of contact interaction of gas 
stream with the streamline surface in the form of the static head law has allowed to find the 
spatial−energy liaison in flowing system. The physically correct combination of mechanics 
of contact interaction and thermodynamics of fluid medium in one formula has allowed si-
multaneously to be liberated from the velocity coefficient and the discharge coefficient and 
polytropic process. In the new form the formula has gained the key character for computa-
tion of parameters of motion and state of gas stream in the flowing system.

1 Introduction 

The  development  of  modern  groundworks  of  gas 
dynamics  in  the  field  of  the  flowing  elements  and 
systems is bound with necessity not only to create of 
the  physically adequate conceptual ideas and to de-
rive  on  its  base  of  new  mathematical  expressions, 
but also revise and find the final form of some exist-
ing  formulae.  Saint-Venant−Wantzel's  formula  for 
determining  of  the  outflow  velocity  of  gas  stream 
out  of  flowing  element,  system  under  specified 
value of pressure drop is one of the formulae, which 
has major value in gas dynamics of flowing systems 
and to which it is necessary to impart the final form.

2 Approach 

The  considered  formula  is  a  product  of  long-term 
development.  Its  history  was  started  by  Torricelli 
and  Galilei  experiments  with  the  drop  water 
stream  in  1643.  Further,  approximately  120  years 
later, Borda and Du Buat have given to it the final 
form for mechanics and hydraulics. 

After,  about  60  years  later  (1839),  Saint-Venant 
and Wantzel had substituted the available work of 
gas expansion in the conditions of mechanical and 
thermal  isolation  instead  of  height  of  free  fall  in 
the  Torricelli-Galilei-Borda-DuBuat  (TGBD)  for-
mula. So, SVW formula was appeared:

Writing  of  SVW  formula  in  the  form  (1)  exactly 
conform  to  substitution  in  TGBD  formula  of  the 
available  work  of  gas  expansion  in  reversible 
adiabatic  (isentropic)  process.  Writing  of  SVW 
formula in the form (2) imply that the outflow ve-
locity of gas stream out of flowing element is de-
termined  by  the  product  of  a  maximum  possible 
outflow  velocity  of  gas  (outflow  in  vacuum)  and 
the  dimensionless  radicand  containing  initial    p0  

 

 

and  final    ph    pressures.  In  the  contracted  form  it 
will match of the writing:

it is not difficult to detect that  Н  is simultaneously 
both  difference  of  potentials  of  the  propulsive  en-
ergy,  and  the  spatial  longitudinal  coordinate  of  the 
motion during the free fall in it. 
At  comparison  of  the  TGBD  and  SVW  formulae 
also it is not difficult to note, that the spatial coordi-
nate  of  motion  vanishes  in  SVW  formula  when  the 
available  work  of  gas  expansion  in  the  reversible 
adiabatic process is substituted instead of the height 
of free fall in TGBD formula. This feature is entirely 
typical for thermodynamics, however the usefulness 
of  the  SVW  formula  becomes  more  than  doubtful 
for  calculation  of  outflow  velocity  out  of  flowing 
element.  So,  both  viewed  formulae  are  non-
connected  with  any  kind  of  the  interaction  of  the 
moving  solid,  fluid  medium  with  ambient  objects 
and  mediums.  And  alongside  with  it  the  spatial  co-
ordinate  of  motion  is  absent  in  SVW  formula.  At 
first  sight  the  unfavourable  situation  becomes  con-
structive  at  the  approach  to  it  from  the  positions  of 
contact  interaction  energy.  The  SVW  formula  ac-
cording  to  such  approach  is  the  conservation  equa-
tion of energy (the weight or volume density of en-
ergy more precisely) in the simplest form. The prob-
lem  is  to  take  into  account  the  spatially  -  energy 
connection  of  the  flowing  system  the  physically 
adequately and mathematically correctly in this con-
servation  equation.    The  mathematical  expression 
for  the  spatially  -  energy  connection  of  gas  stream 
with  wall  of  flowing  element  is  necessary  to  have 
and  to  know,  how  this  connection  will  be  inserted 
into  considered  equation  for  the  solution  of  the 
problem. 

3 Solution 

The  mathematical  expression  of  the  spatially  -  en-
ergy connection of gas stream with wall is shown in 
[1, 2] in the form of static head law for gas stream in 
flowing  element. There are simultaneously the con-
tact interaction energy of gas stream with streamline 
surface  and  power  of  the  counter  pressure  in  this 
law.  This  second  factor  has  been  presented  in  the 
traditional form of the writing of SVW formula. The 
solution  of  the  formulated  problem  is  reduced  to

Expressions (5,6) are the final form of the formula 
for  the  outflow  velocity  of  gas  stream  out  of  the 
flowing  element.  The  obtained  expressions  have 
generality, and SVW formula is its particular form 
for  solution  of  problem  concerned  with  the  de-
scription of the gas pointwise - symmetric (spheri-
cal)  expansion  in  gaseous  medium.  At  the  same 
time the mass centre of the gas is kept in rest. 

4 Discussion of results 

The  obtained  expression  in  the  forms  (5,  6)  im-
plies, that the actual outflow velocity of gas stream 
is determined as kinematic parameter of motion by 
its maximum possible quantity at outflow to empty 
space  (Vmax)  with  taking  into  account  of  energy 
contents of the outflowing and surrounding medi-
ums  and  intensity  of  contact  interaction  of  gas 
stream with the walls of the flowing element. Such 
the  physical  sense  is  much  wider  than  sense  in-
cluded in it by Saint-Venant and Wantzel and con-
sisting in the simple substitution of expression for 
the  available  work  of  gas  expansion  at  reversible 
adiabatic  (polytropic)  process instead of height of 
free  fall  in  TGBD  formula.  The  new  physical 
sense is wider as well than the traditional thermo-
dynamic  interpretation,  according  to  which  the 
outflow  velocity  is  determined  by  difference  of 
heat  contents  (enthalpies)  of  outflowing  and  sur-
rounding mediums.  

The distinguish of principle of the new formula is 
also what the process of the motion is presented as 
a  mechanically  irreversible  process  in  it.  This 
property  of  motion  of  gas  stream  in  the  flowing 
element is the alienable and permanent factor. The 
heat exchange can be absent. In this case, the out-

2

 

 

flow  process  will  be  adiabatic.  It  can  be  absent  ac-
tion  on  the  gas  stream  of  any  physical  factor:  heat, 
additional  weight-flow,  technical  work.  The  factor 
of the contact interaction of the gas stream with the 
flowing  element  wall  acts  always  and  renders  the 
primary and determining influence on the gas stream 
state  and  motion  parameters.  The  expansion  of  the 
physical  sense  of  the  considered  formula  from  nar-
row-thermodynamic  up  to  the  full  value  thermo-
mechanical  allows  to  utilize  it  as  the  effective  tool 
for  exposition  both  calculation  of  the  motion  and 
state parameters of gas stream in multiplicity of ac-
tual  circumstances  that  is,  with  taking  into  account 
of  the  contact  interaction,  heat  transfer,  the  addi-
tional  weight  flow,  technical  work,  aggregate  state 
modifications,  thermo-chemical  transmutations.  At 
comparing the obtained formula with SVW formula, 
it is necessary to note, that they both allow to deter-
mine the gas stream velocity, firstly, on an outlet of 
flowing element (pipe) and, secondly, as the average 
weight-flow  quantity  that  is,  without  taking  into 
account of the features of its allocation on cross sec-
tion of the flowing element. Along with it, it is nec-
essary  to  note  the  difference  of  principle  between 
them.  Firstly,  the  new  formula  allows  to  take  into 
account  the  influence  on  average  velocity  of  the 
outflow of any physical factors acting on the way of 
the stream motion. Secondly, the new formula is free 
from  "magic"  influence  to  it  of  such  conventional 
constant as the critical ratio of the pressure. It allows 
to determine the individual critical ratio for any ac-
tual  flowing  element  with  taking  into  account  of 
physical factors acting on the stream. It is necessary 
also  to  note  that  the  attempts  of  usage  of  the  SVW 
formula for solving of technical gas dynamics prob-
lems have been giving the series of its "perfections" 
during last approximately 170 years. 

The  velocity  and  the  weight-flow  coefficients  were 
entered  by  analogy  with  hydraulics,  which  define 
experimentally [3]. However experiment has shown, 
that,  as  against  hydraulics,  the  quantity  of  the 
weight-flow  coefficient  for  gas  stream  can  be  both 
smaller  and  greater  unity.  In  one  of  the  correctly 
produced  experiments  [4],  the  discharge  of  vessel 
happened much faster than on results of calculation 
by  means  of  isentropic  SVW  formula.  The  poly-
tropic  process  not  existing  in  the  nature  for  which 
the  polytropic  exponent  is  variable  number  was  in-
vented  [3,5,6]  by  analogy  with  mathematical  ther-
modynamics.  Let  alone  that,  what it is necessary to 
determine  this  exponent  experimentally  for  each 

 

 

special  case,  this  idea  is  situated  in  a  complete 
contradiction  to  the  molecular-kinetic  theory.  In-
troduction in gas dynamics of the isentropic proc-
ess  conception,  entirely  appropriate  to  SVW  for-
mula,  has  resulted  creation  of  the  gas  dynamics 
tables in the form of system of the ratios devoid of 
the spatial coordinates of motion [7]. Not stopping 
on  more small-sized "betterments", it is necessary 
to  underline,  that  the  expressions  (5,  6,  7)  allow 
correctly  and  precisely  to  present  the  motion  of 
gas  stream  in  actual  circumstances  and  does  not 
require changes at determining of flow parameters 
both in subcritical and in overcritical conditions. 

5 Final remark 

Only now, after 164 years, it is obtained the Saint-
Venant-Wantzal  formula  form  allowing  for  the 
first time rightly and exactly to determine the state 
and  motion  parameters  of  gas  stream  along  the 
length of flowing element, system.

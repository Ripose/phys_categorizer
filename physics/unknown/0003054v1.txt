The introduction of transaction costs into the theory of option pricing

could lead not only to the change of return for options, but also to the change

of the volatility. On the base of assumption of the portfolio analysis, a new

equation for option pricing with transaction costs is derived.  A new solution

for the option price is obtained for the time close to expiration date.

Keywords: Option, Transaction costs, Market, Volatility.

Introduction.

The  problem  of  option  pricing  with  transaction  costs  is  one  of  the

most  interesting  and  important  problems  in  the  theory  of  option  pricing

[1,3].  The  problem  could  be  rephrased  as  a  try  to  extend  the  results  from

Black-Scholes theory to the incomplete market. In the standard approach the

possible  return  for  the  option  is  decremented  by  the  transaction  costs  (the

results derived by Leland and Wilmott [3] ). However, the introduction of

transaction costs could also lead to the change of volatility. Because of this,

new terms could appear in the option equation. On the base of this idea the

new  equation  for  option  pricing  with  transaction  costs  is  derived  in  this

article.    The  new  solutions  are  obtained  and  the  conditions  of  their

applicability are discussed.

Method.

First of all, let us reproduce the derivation of Black - Scholes equation

for call option on the base of risk-return argument (for simplicity’s sake, we

will consider the European call option). In order to do this we will write a

change in security value in the specific form. We will assume that dP in time

2

is determined by the sum of two factors: a factor that depends on the term

proportional to dt and the factor proportional to dz:

dP = Pt*dt + Pz*dz,

               (1)

where t is time and z is Wiener process. Now we will use these notations in

order to connect risk and return for different instruments. Proportionality of

risk and return in these terms could be expressed in the form:

=

k

P
t
|

−
P
z

rP
|

               (2)

 For option we could write Pt as:

Pt

and Pz :

= σ

     (3)

     (4)

Because the investor will make sure that relationship between risk and return

for option and stock would be the same we could write that :

µλλλ

=

=

op

(

s

)

               (5)

where 

λ is the market price of risk for option and 

op

λis the market price of

s

risk for stock. Combining (2)  and (5) we could immediately obtain:

P

Now, let's consider the same equation in the case of transaction costs. We

will  assume  that  we  are  using  option  for  hedging  and  we  are  changing

portfolio all the time. In this case: we need to find new changed factors from

equation (2) - new return and new volatility. In order to do this let's rewrite

differential dP into a new form:

From (13) one can immediately obtain that on average:

   (14)

This means that the term dP1 corresponds to volatility term in (2). When dP0

- Ldt is proportional to the usual return for derivatives with transaction costs

[3],  dP1  is  constructed  from  different  terms,  one  of  which  is  the  usual

volatility term and the others appear because of transaction costs.

Let's calculate an average value of dP1

because all terms, proportional to dz disappear (<dz> = 0). Let's remind also

that:

<A|dz|> = Ldt

  (16)

The origin of a new term in volatility is simple. Even, if < A|dz| – Ldt > =  0,

it doesn't mean that  <  (A|dz| – Ldt)2  > =  0.

This a new equation for P (price of option with transaction costs). This

equation confirms that the value of option price with transactions costs

changed not only because transactions costs lead to changed return, but

6

because transactions costs could also influence volatility. This equation

equally shows the importance of both. Let us find the solution of this

equation for two special cases:

1.  Small transaction costs (k – small and we could consider

2. Price of option near time of expiration. In small interval close to time of

expiration it is possible to assume [for example in [3], for the case of

Asian options]  that dominant term is proportional to 

∂
P

∂

 in comparison

with

The equation similar to well known equation ( [3] ) from the theory of

options with transactions costs could be obtained from (24) in case we will

completely neglect the last term D.

This equation is similar to the new equation suggested in the paper [2], but

with the influence of transactions costs (term L). Also it is usual equation

from the theory of option pricing with transactions costs.

Time close to the expiration.

If we completely neglect 

∂  in the denominator of (21) we could get the

This equation is very similar to the usual Black-Scholes equation, and if we

assume that

 (what is correct for options without transactions costs),

the equation (26) could be rewritten as:

The solution of this equation is Black-Scholes solution for the case of

options with dividends, when we need to assume that one of parameters in

this formula (rate of dividend) is negative:

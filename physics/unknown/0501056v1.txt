OF THE BLACK HOLE THERMODYNAMICS

 The Concepts of “Area Entropy”, “Temperature” and “Radiation”

Xinyong Fu, Shanghai Jiao Tong University,  xyfu@sjtu.edu.cn

Introduction

In early seventies of last century, Bekenstein and Hawking put forward the concepts of  the

“area  entropy”,  “gravitational  temperature”  and  “thermal  radiation”  of  a  black  hole,  and  thus
established a new branch of astrophysics, namely, the black hole thermodynamics (1) (2).

In  his  arxiv paper  THE  ORIGIN  OF  ENERGY  FOR  THE  BIG  BANG  (3),  the  author  of  this

paper  and  his  cooperator  Zitao  Fu  put  forward  a  new  model  of  the  universe:  The  universe  is

gravitationally  closed,  filled  up  with  an  equilibrium  radiation  at  a  temperature  of  about  3  K;  its

main  part  is  just  such  a  vast  heat  ocean,  and  all  the  real  matter  is  only  a  small  fraction,  which

exploding and concentrating within the heat ocean repeatedly. They analyzed the process in which

a black hole attracts thermal radiation from the cosmic space, asserting that, in physics, such an

energy-concentrating process is very special, which reduces entropy, violating the second law of

thermodynamics.  They  emphasized  that  black  holes  play  a  very  special  and  crucial  role  in  the

great circulation of matter and energy in the universe.

The  author’s  ideas  are  completely  different  from  those  of  Bekenstein  and  Hawking.  These

differences are discussed in detail in this paper.

1. Is the area of event horizon of a black hole also entropy?

Bekenstein and Hawking hold: the second law of thermodynamics is valid everywhere;

though  the  absorption  of  heat  radiation  from  the  cosmic  space  by  a  black  hole  reduces  the

entropy  of  the  space,  in  the  meantime,  the  area  of  the  event  horizon  of  the  black  hole

increases; they argue that the area of the event horizon is also entropy, and the overall change

in entropy in the whole absorption process is still an increase.

Contrary  to  their  opinion,  the  author  of  this  paper  hold:  the  reasons  with  which

Bekenstein and Hawking regard a black hole’s area as entropy are inadequate; a black hole’s

absorbing  heat  from  cosmic  space  results  in  a  decrease  of  entropy,  in  contradiction  to  the

second law of thermodynamics.

Let us compare these two opposite opinions and see which one is correct.

Hawking verified that the area of event horizon of a black hole never decreases. That is

his famous theorem of non-decreasing of a black hole’s area. Furthermore, he and Bekenstein

thought  that  the  non-decreasing  behavior  of  a  black  hole’s  area  is  very  reminiscent  of  the

1

behavior of the entropy of a solitary system, which never decreases, either. This reminiscence

led them to think that a black hole’s area is a measure of its entropy.

The author holds that the “reminiscence” or “similarity” Bekenstein and Hawking speak

of here is actually a false one.

Why?

As is well known, the increase of entropy of a solitary system is due to some irreversible

processes happened within the system, and it has  nothing to do with the exterior world, the

environment.

increase.

Contrarily,  the  increase  of  a  black  hole’s  area  is  due  to  the  import  of  matter  or  energy

from the environment. If there is no import of matter or energy from the exterior, no matter

what processes happen within the black hole, it is impossible for its area of event horizon to

So, although both of the two processes are “increase of something”, one is totally caused

by  some  interior  events,  independent  from  the  exterior  world,  and  the  other  happens  at  the

cost  of  the  loss  of  matter  and  energy  of  the  exterior  world,  relying  nothing  on  any  interior

events. Obviously, the patterns of the two events are absolutely different, not similar at all.

Furthermore,  let’s  make  a  compare  between  the  physical  mechanisms  of  the  two

processes of “increase of something”.

The  physical  mechanism  of  the  increase  of  entropy  of  a  solitary  system  is  some

irreversible  processes  within  the  system.  There  are  a  great  variety  of  such  irreversible

processes,  but  all  of  them  belong  to  the  category  of  thermodynamics,  showing  strong

thermodynamic color or style, such as work converts into heat through friction  or  collision,

heat  transmits  from  higher  temperature  to  lower  temperature,  non-uniform  in  pressure  or

density changes automatically toward uniform, etc.

On the other hand, the increase of the area of an event horizon of a black hole is simply

determined  by  the  import  of  matter  and  energy  from  the  exterior.  The  relation  between  the

increase of the area of the event horizon and the import amount of matter and energy can be

determined directly and easily by the formula of the area of the event horizon, which, for a

Schwarzschild black hole, is

A

nothing to do with thermodynamics.

Such  a  formula  belongs  purely  to  the  category  of  static  mechanics  of  relativity,  and  it  has

So,  the  physical  mechanisms  of  the  two  kinds  of  “increase  of  something”  are  also  not

2

similar to each other at all.

Hence, there is no any real similarity between the increase of a black hole’s area and the

increase of the entropy of a solitary system. The comparison between these two processes

made by Bekenstein and Hawking is a careless done job, and we cannot accept their hasty and

rough conclusion that a black hole’s area is also entropy.

Further more, in thermodynamics, there are a variety of forms of entropies, and entropies

in different forms equivalent to each other quantitatively. In other words, entropy is actually

an  equivalent  quantity.  The  equivalent  relations  between  different  forms  of  entropies  are

based  on  the  reversible  processes  that  link  up  the  different  forms  of  entropies.    Entropy  is

actually  conserved  in  any  reversible  process. A  certain  quantity  of  entropy  in  one  form  can

convert totally through some reversible process into a certain quantity of entropy in another

form, without producing any other effects. The meaning of “reversible process” here is well

known: the finally obtained entropy can convert back totally through a process carried out in

the  opposite  direction  step  by  step  into  the  original  entropy,  without  producing  any  other

effect.  By  the  way,  a  reversible  process  can  also  be  expressed  in  a  broader  way  as  follows:

after it has occurred, both the system and the environment can restore to their original states

entirely  through  whatever  a  process.  Hence,  if  there  is  someone  who  intends  to  introduce  a

new entropy into physics, he or she should find out such and such a reversible process that

can  link  up  the  new  entropy  with  any  of  the  traditional  entropies,  for  example,  the  heat-

temperature-quotient  entropy  or  volume  entropy,  and  determine  the  special  quantitative

equivalent relation between the new one and the traditional one.

Can  we  find  any  reversible  process  that  can  link  up  a  black  hole’s  area  with  some

traditional  entropy?  The  process  of  thermal  radiation’s  falling  into  a  black  hole  is  an

extremely violent spontaneous process, and we cannot control it in any way. Such a process

itself is certainly an irreversible process. Neither can we find any other reversible process that

can  link  up  the  above  mentioned  two  quantities  and  determine  their  quantitative  relation.

Hence, there is no reason to regard a black hole’s area as entropy.

Bekenstein, Hawking and others tried again to use Boltzmann’s relation 

 to
show  that  a  black  hole’s  area  is  entropy  (4)  (5).  Nevertheless,  everyone  knows  that  Ω   is  the

number of the microscopic states corresponding to a statistic distribution. The physical state

of  a  black  hole,  according  to  Bekenstein,  Hawking  and  some  others,  can  be  completely
determined by three quantities, namely, its mass  M , angular speed ω  and electric charge  Q .

Therefore,  the  general  number  of  the  microscopic  states  of  a  black  hole  is  only  one.

According to Boltzmann’s relation, its entropy is zero. Still they won’t give up, they invented

here  a  fantastic  explanation  that  Ω   is  “  the  total  number  of  the  microscopic  ways  of  the

formations of the black hole ”.

Entropy is a state quantity of a system. The entropy of a system  at  a  certain  instant  is

determined only by the state at the instant, and it has nothing to do with its past history. To

speak  in  more  conventional  words  in  thermodynamics,  the  entropy  of  a  system  at  a  certain

state has nothing to do with the special process or path through which the system reached the

state. And of course, this state quantity is even more impossible to be related to the number of

the possible microscopic ways through which the system can reach its present state!

Thermodynamics should not be “developed” in such a distorted way.

Let’s proceed further.

It is rather comical that Hawking verified later that a black hole has radiation. It radiates

thermal  radiation  as  well  as  matter  particles.  These  radiations,  just  as  he  said,  result  in  the

reduction of the mass of the black hole, and hence the reduction of the area of the black hole.

So,  a  black  hole’s  area  can  also  decrease.  And  then,  is  the  theorem  of  “no-decreasing  of  a

black hole’s area” still valid? As the theorem is no longer valid, how can they still speak of

the “similarity” between a black hole’s area and the entropy of a solitary system? Everyone

knows that the entropy of a solitary system never decrease, which is valid in all the cases.

The  author’s  opinion  is  as  follows.  The  event  horizon  of  a  black hole  permits  thermal

radiation passing through it from the exterior into the black hole, never from the interior to the

exterior  space,  so  it  is  a  “one-way  membrane”  for  thermal  radiation.  In  other  words,  it  is  a

Maxwell’s  demon  in  nature.  Stars  give  off  light  and  heat,  that  is  energy  going  from  a

concentric state to a scattered state, from a high temperature to a low temperature, resulting in

the increase of entropy; black holes, quite contrarily, collect thermal radiation from the space,

that is energy going from a scattered state to a concentric state, from a low temperature to a

high temperature, resulting in the decrease of entropy. It is very apparent that the two kinds of

processes are opposite to each other, and from the viewpoint of energy circulation, they are

actually complementary to each other. The author wonders that why these people cannot catch

sight of so simple and so explicit a fact.

Bekenstein and Hawking may argue that a black hole’s “radiation” is always connected

to a “temperature” (the gravitational acceleration at the event horizon), and the quotient of the

radiated  heat  from  a  black  hole  to  its  “temperature”  is  also  entropy.  So,  in  a  Hawking

radiation,  the  area  entropy  is  actually  transformed  into  heat-temperature  entropy  and  flows

outward  into  the  space,  and  the  overall  change  in  entropy  for  the  process  is  still  not  a

decreasing one, in accord with the demands of the second law.

Such an argument is also incorrect. In the third part of this paper, the author will show in

details  that  Hawking  radiation  is  unidirectional,  different  from  the  isotropic  radiation  of  a

black  body  at  certain  temperature.  Like  a  laser  beam,  due  to  its  uni-direction,  Hawking

radiation  can  easily  be  concentrated  and  result  in  very  high  temperature.  Hence  the

4

temperature  of  a  Hawking  radiation  is  not 

T

=

πκ 2
k

,  but  extremely  high.  Hence,  the

outward flow of heat-temperature entropy in a Hawking radiation is about zero. In short, there

is  no  area  entropy  that  changes  into  heat-temperature  entropy  and  flows  outward  from  the

black hole to the space.

Taking Hawking radiation into account, the theorem of non-decreasing of a black hole’s

area  is  no  longer  valid,  and  Bekenstein  and  Hawking’s  idea  that  a  black  hole’s  area  means

entropy is no longer valid, either.  

2. Geroch’s “gravitational engine” and a black hole’s “temperature”

Via  a  detailed  discussion  on  the  cycle  of  an  ideal  “gravitational  engine”,  Geroch  and

Bekenstein  proved  that  the  gravitational  acceleration  near  the  event  horizon  of  a  black  hole

corresponds to a certain “temperature” , the relation between the two is 

T

=

πκ 2
k

. (6)

The author holds that their discussion is wrong.

The “gravitational engine” they described is a cycling device. Like all the previous heat

engines, the device works between a high temperature heat reservoir and a low temperature

heat reservoir. Firstly, how heat is spent and how work is done in a cycle is described. In their

succeeding discussion, a quantum mechanical restriction to the size of a box, which is used to

carry  thermal  radiation,  is  cited.  Wien’s  displacement  law  of  black  body  radiation  is  cited.

The  famous  Carnot’s  principle  is  also  cited,  giving  an  upper  limit  to  the  efficiency  of  heat-

work  conversion.  And  so  on.  Finally,  through  a  comparison  between  two  inequalities,  the

relation  between  the  gravitational  acceleration  at  the  event  horizon  and  the  black  hole’s

“temperature”, 

T

=

πκ 2
k

, is obtained. The whole verification involves so many important

concepts  of  classical  and  modern  physics,  and  sets  forth  a  series  of  smart  mathematical

calculates, hence it looks very profound and integrated.

Nevertheless,  there  is  one  thing  astonishing  in  their  discussion:  In  each  cycle,  the  heat

extracted from the high temperature is equal to the heat released to the low temperature! That

is  to  say,  no  any  net  heat  changes  into  work.  Then,  where  does  the  work  performed  come

from? According to them, all the work done by the “engine” comes from the reduction of the

gravitational potential energy of the heat radiation, which, according to relativity,  has  mass,

too.  How  much  this  potential  energy  is  decreased,  how  much  work  is  done.  Nevertheless,

everyone  knows  that,  in  physics,  gravitational  potential  energy  can  be  used  directly  to  do

work, and this has nothing to do with heat-work conversion (i.e., heat engine). So, it is clear

that  Geroch’s  device  is  totally  not  a  heat  engine,  but  a  simple  mechanical  apparatus.  How

ridiculous it is to apply Carnot’s principle to an apparatus that is totally not a heat engine! The

whole proof is just knocking things together to get the pre-selected conclusion, 

T

=

πκ 2
k

.

It seems that Geroch and Bekenstein, in their discussion, went backwards to James Watt

and Sadi Carnot’s time. Most people of the time believed in caloric theory (Carnot believed in

caloric theory when he was young). According to that theory, a steam engine extracts a certain

amount  of  heat  from  a  high  temperature  in  each  cycle,  after  doing  work,  all  the  heat  is

released  to  the  low  temperature.  There  is  no  net  decrease  of  the  heat.  It  was  impossible  for

people of that time to think that the total amount of the heat would decrease, as they believed

that  “the  caloric  itself  is  conserved.”  They  just  thought  that  in  a  steam  engine  work  is

performed by the driving force of the flow of the caloric from the high temperature to the low

temperature. Such a “mechanism” is very similar to the one of a water turbine in a hydraulic

power plant. As is well known, a water turbine relies only on the driving force of the flowing

water from a higher altitude to a lower one. The mass of water here is conserved. The work

obtained is not at the cost of any loss of the mass of the water.

The establishment of the first law and the second law of thermodynamics refuted down

the caloric theory to the last point. The mechanism of a heat engine is totally different from

the  one  of  a  water  turbine!  A  steam  engine  extracts  certain  amount  of  heat  from  the  higher

temperature  in  a  cycle,  a  fraction  of  the  heat  is  released  to  the  low  temperature,  the  left  is

converted into work, and the total amount of the heat is decreased. Heat engine is just such an

apparatus that converts part of the heat into work.

In  Geroch  and  Bekenstein’s  “gravitational  engine”,  the  heat  extracted  from  the  high

temperature equals the heat released to the low temperature, so its mechanism is completely

identical to a water turbine. Such an apparatus is certainly not a heat engine. Actually, they

missed here the definition of a heat engine.

There  is  nothing  profound  or  abstruse  here,  and  it  is  certainly  impossible  that  Geroch

and Bekenstein really did not know these ABC of thermodynamics. Their mistake was only a

careless slip. Nevertheless, there is a real cause of the careless slip, which is their endeavor to

establish  an  intrinsic  link  between  the  gravitational  acceleration  and  a  black  hole’s

“temperature”, and such a link actually does not exist. Marching in a totally wrong direction

tends to lead people falling down.

3. Hawking radiation, its “spectrum” and “temperature”

Hawking  radiation  is  due  to  the  quantum  fluctuation  of  vacuum  and  the  gravitational

acceleration  near  the  event  horizon  of  a  black  hole.  Hawking  found  that  the  mathematical

expression of the spectrum of the radiation, which he derived, is pretty similar to the one of a

black  body  radiation  at  certain  temperature,  differing  only  a  constant  factor  between  the

gravitational acceleration of the former and the temperature of the latter, 

κ 2/

Tk =π

. Hence,

6

Hawking  and  others  asserted  that  the  gravitational  acceleration  here  is  actually  the  black

hole’s “temperature”.

The author holds that, the “similarity”  between  the  two  expressions  Hawking  found  is

only some mathematical coincidence. As viewed from thermodynamics, it is incorrect to hold

that  the  gravitational  acceleration  near  the  event  horizon  represents  the  black  hole’s

“temperature”. The reasons are as follows.

The  physical  mechanism  of  black  body  radiation,  according  to  the  original  ideas  of

Rayleigh-Jeans  and  Planck,  is  the  random  thermal  motion  of  numerous  electro-magnetic

harmonic  oscillators  of  various  wavelengths  in  a  cavity  at  a  thermal  equilibrium  state.  The

oscillators  obey  Boltzmann’s  distribution,  and  the  spectrum  of  the  radiation  depends  on  the

temperature that is determined by the intensity of the random motion of all the oscillators. If

we look at it in another way, i.e., from the viewpoint of photon gas, the physical mechanism

of black body radiation is the random thermal motion of numerous photons (bosons, obeying

Bose-Einstein distribution), and the spectrum of the radiation depends on the temperature that

is determined by the intensity of the random motion of all the photons. In a word, the physical

mechanism  of  a  black  body  radiation  is  the  random  thermal  motion  of  a  great  number  of

quasi-independent subsystems in an equilibrium thermodynamic system, and the temperature

is a measurement of the intensity of the random thermal motion of all the quasi-independent

subsystems.

The  physical  mechanism  of  Hawking  radiation  is  the  quantum  fluctuation  of  vacuum

near  the  event  horizon,  which  is  related  closely  to  the  gravitational  acceleration  at  the  site.

The  author’s  opinion  is:  gravitational  acceleration  is  just  the  intensity  of  the  gravitational

field,  and  that  is  all,  nothing  more.  Gravitational  acceleration  is  totally  different  from

temperature,  i.e.,  totally  different  from  the  intensity  of  the  random  thermal  motion  of

numerous microscopic particles.

To  understand  better  the  difference  between  the  gravitational  acceleration  and  the

temperature here, let us make some further comparison between the two radiations.

First, black body radiation is isotropic, while Hawking radiation is fairly unidirectional.

Black  body  radiation  is  equilibrium  thermal  radiation.  Due  to  its  origin  of  random

thermal  motion,  isotropic  is  an  absolutely  necessary  and  essential  characteristic  of  the

radiation.

Hawking  radiation  is  due  to  the  quantum  fluctuation  of  vacuum  and  the  gravitational

acceleration, and it is fairly unidirectional. Take the radiation in Kerr-Newman-de Sitter time-

space as an example, the outward wave function of the scalar particles is

Out the event horizon, the above wave function represents the photon current that is produced
at  the  event  horizon  and  going  outward  in  the  direction  of  the  radius  of  the  black  hole  (7).

Obviously, this is a unidirectional radiation.

        What  is  the  difference  between  the  properties  or  behaviors  of  isotropic  radiation  and

unidirectional radiation?

The black body radiation at certain temperature is isotropic, that means, its radiations in

all  the  directions  in  the  4π  solid  angle  are  identical  in  spectrum  as  well  as  in  intensity.  No

matter  how  we  tried  to  concentrate  such  a  radiation,  it  is  impossible  to  form  a  temperature

higher  than  the  original  temperature  of  the  radiation.  For  example,  the  temperature  at  the

surface  of  the  sun  is  about  6000°C,  hence  the  light  and  heat  ejected  by  it  is  a  black  body

radiation of 6000°C. With a lens or lots of mirrors, we can concentrate the sun’s radiation to

obtain  a  high  temperature.  Nevertheless,  the  highest  temperature  we  can  obtain  this  way  is

just 6000°C.

Hawking radiation is quite different. Due to its fine uni-directionality, it should be very

easy to concentrate it to form an extremely high temperature. This is similar to a laser beam,

which,  due  to  its  uni-directionality,  is  very  easy  to  be  concentrated  to  form  a  very  high

temperature.  Therefore,  as  viewed  from  thermodynamics,  the  temperature  of  Hawking

radiation is not 

T

κ 2/=

π

, but very high, approximately infinite.

    Some people may argue that, the general wave function of Hawking radiation is

It seems to be also related to the angular coordinates φθ ,

, and hence, it is not unidirectional,

but isotropic.

This  argument  is  not  correct.  The  vertexes  of  the  angles φθ ,

,  i.e.,  the  origin  of  all  the

coordinates related here ( φθ ,

and r), is the center of the black hole, not the site on the event

horizon where the photons are produced. After their birth, the photons do not fly away from

the birth site in all the directions. They only fly away along the radius of the black hole. So, it

is  a  unidirectional  radiation.  Actually, 

φθ ,

  just  represent  the  coordinates  of  the  position  of

the birth site of the photons on the event horizon.

This is Planck’s formula for black body radiation. The formula shows that the spectrum of a

black  body  radiation  is  determined  mainly  by  two  factors,  one  is  the  Bose-Einstein

factor

Let us have a look at the origin of the two factors.

 consists two sub-factors, 

2ω  and  ωh .  (a) The origin of

In the above expression, the different momentums in all the directions in the  π4  solid angle

have been taken into account, that is, the isotropy of the black body radiation has been taken
into account.  (b) The factor  ωh : as is well known, it is the energy of one photon.

Planck’s  formula  represents  the  monochromatic  radiation  of  a  black  body  at  certain
. Integrate it over ω  from zero to

result,  i.e.,  the  energy  volume  density  of  the  full-color  radiation  is 

u α=

4T

,  and  the

corresponding area radiation intensity is

Γ

.

The above discussion is of the spectrum and full-color radiation of black body radiation.

Now let us have a look at Hawking radiation.

In a Hawking radiation, the photon current 

 itself is the intensity
of monochromatic radiation of the frequency ω  (per unit area). It is unidirectional, that is, its
photons are not radiated from their birth site in all the directions in the  π4  solid angle. They

Hence, the factor 

2ω  will not appear in the spectrum expression of Hawking radiation. There

are also two factors in the spectrum of Hawking radiation, the first one is 
,
similar to the Bose-Einstein factor, and the second one is  ωh , the energy of one photon, not
3ωh
. Hence, the spectrum of a Hawking radiation must be different from the spectrum of a
black body radiation by a factor of 

2ω . They are different!

Consequently,  due  to  the  difference  of 

2ω ,  the  integration  or  summation  of  the
monochromatic radiations of a Hawking radiation overω , i.e., its full-color radiation, should

also be different from Stefan-Boltzmann’s law. It cannot be Γ

4Tσ=

.

In short, Hawking radiation is obviously different from black body radiation.
According  to  Boltzmann’s  principle  of  detailed  balance,  a  macroscopic  thermal

equilibrium must be the aggregate of the corresponding detailed balance. For an equilibrium

thermal radiation, at any site (within the cavity) and in every two opposite directions in the

π4  solid angle (the positive direction and the corresponding negative one), the radiation of

every  wavelength keeps  balanced  itself.  Now  that  the  Hawking  radiation  is  a  unidirectional

one,  while  the  black  body  radiation  is  an  isotropic  one,  and  what’s  the  more,  their  spectra

differ  for  a  factor 

2ω ,  very  apparently,  it  is  impossible  for  the  two  kinds  of  radiations  to

constitute  a  detailed  balance.  Accordingly,  we  certainly  refuse  to  agree  that  when  the  two

radiations  are  at  a  “same  temperature”  (

κ 2/

Tk =π

),  they  can  keep  equilibrium  to  each

other.  From  this  point  of  view,  it  is  also  wrong  to  regard  Hawking  radiation  as  a  thermal

radiation at certain temperature.

Let  us  summarize  the  above  comparison  between  the  two  radiations.  The  factor

 in the spectrum formula of Hawking radiation is really very similar to the

 in the spectrum formula of a black body radiation. So it is

understandable that Hawking and others imagined that the acceleration near the event horizon

might  actually  be  the  black  hole’s  “temperature”.  Nevertheless,  black  body  radiation  is

isotropic, while Hawking radiation is unidirectional, and that is a major and crucial difference

between the two radiations. Further, their spectra do not coincide to each other, differing with

a factor 

2ω . All these differences reflect profoundly the different origin of the two radiations:

the  isotropic  one  (black  body  radiation)  results  from  the  random  thermal  motion,  the

unidirectional  one  (Hawking  radiation)  results  from  the  quantum  vacuum  fluctuation  under

strong  gravitational  action.  Hence,  we  conclude  that  we  have  no  reason  to  regard  the

gravitational acceleration near the event horizon as the “temperature” of the black hole. The

similarity  between  the  two  factors,

  and

By  the  way,  Hawking  radiation  and  a  black  hole’s  “temperature”  sound  extraordinary

and attracting, nevertheless, they are actually not of great importance. According to Hawking

and others’ calculation, the “temperature” of a black hole is

For black holes as large as a star, this “temperature” is lower than 0.000,001 K. The influence

of the radiation corresponding to such a “temperature” on the evolution of the black hole itself

is extremely small, and it can practically be neglect. Its influence on the exterior world is even

more  negligible.  For  black  holes  as  large  as  a  galaxy,  their  “temperature”  and  radiation  are

even much lower and weaker, and no one will take into account their influence to their own

evolution  as  well  as  to  the  exterior  world.  As  to  the  “primordial  small  black  holes”,  whose
masses are of the grade of 1012 kg, the “temperature” is high, and the radiation is powerful,

even  violent.  Nevertheless,  such  “primordial  small  black  holes”  can  only  be  formed  under

very  particular  conditions,  and  their  high  temperature  and  explosions  are  of  rather  short

duration. Anyway, their influence on the evolution of the universe, or on the great circulation

of matter and energy in the universe, is very small, not worth mentioning. Small black holes

are strange and peculiar in behavior, and they are very seldom to be seen, hence, many people

regard them with favor. However, in the general frame of cosmology, they are not important,

they have no position.

To study and discuss the radiation and “temperature” of the black holes too much is not

only useless but also detrimental. It leads people to neglect the very important role the black

holes play in the evolution of the universe, namely, their function of re-concentrating matter

and re-concentrating energy. Such a function is unique to black holes, and it is crucial to the

great circulation of matter and energy in the universe. We should not set aside this important

function  of  the  black  holes  and  restrain  our  attention  to  their  extremely  faint  radiation  and

extremely low “temperature”.

4. Black holes and the new thermodynamics

Beyond  any  doubt,  thermal  radiation’s  falling  into  a  black  hole  is  an  energy-gathering

process.  Energy  gathering  is  a  completely  new  phenomenon  in  physics.  It  reduces  entropy,

violating Clausius’ second law!

Stars give off light and heat into the space, scattering energy, resulting in the increase of

entropy. Black holes, quite the contrary, collect the radiation from the space, gathering energy,

resulting  in  the  decrease  of  entropy.  It  is  clear  that  the  two  kinds  of  processes  are  opposite

each  other,  and  they  are  complementary  each  other,  too.  They  can  be  combined  to  form  a

11

circulation of energy in the universe.

The second law is not valid universally. It is not valid for some extraordinary processes:

thermal  radiation’s  falling  into  a  black  hole  is  an  extraordinary  process;  the  experiment

accomplished  recently  by  the  author  and  his  cooperator,  in  which  thermal  electrons  are
controlled by a magnetic demon, is also an extraordinary process (8). The second law is valid

only for ordinary processes.

Entropy  increases  in  ordinary  processes,  and,  it  reduces  in  extraordinary  processes.  That

should be an essential idea in the future thermodynamics.

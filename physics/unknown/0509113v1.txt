ABSTRACT 
We  studied  the  elastic  properties  of  bone  to  analyze  its  mechanical  behavior.  The  basic 
principles  of  ultrasonic  methods  are  now  well  established  for  varying  isotropic  media, 
particularly in the field of biomedical engineering. However, little progress has been made in 
its  application  to  anisotropic  materials.  This  is  largely  due  to  the  complex  nature  of  wave 
propagation  in  these  media.  In  the  present  study,  the  theory  of  elastic  waves  is  essential 
because it relates the elastic moduli of a material to the velocity of propagation of these waves 
along  arbitrary  directions  in  a  solid.  Transducers  are  generally  placed  in  contact  with  the 
samples which are often cubes with parallel faces that are difficult to prepare. The ultrasonic 
method used here is original, a rough preparation of the bone is sufficient and the sample is in 
rotation.  Moreover,  to  analyze  heterogeneity  of  the  structure  we  measure  velocities  in 
different  points  on  the  sample.  The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  determine  in  vitro  the 
anisotropic  elastic  properties  of  cortical  bones.  For  this  purpose,  our  method  allowed 
measuring longitudinal and transversal velocities (CL and CT) in longitudinal (fiber direction) 
and radial directions (orthogonal to the fiber direction) of compact bones. Young's modulus E 
and  Poisson's  ratio  n
,  were  then  deduced  from  the  velocities  measured  considering  the 
compact  bone  as  transversely  isotropic  or  orthotropic.  The  results  are  in  line  with  those  of 
other methods.

INTRODUCTION 

The  present  study  develops  a  new  experimental  ultrasonic  procedure  for  measuring  in  vitro 

the  elastic  characteristics  of  compact  bones.  Methods  of  this  kind  have  been  used  to  study 

compact bones (Ashman et al., 1984; Bonfield and Tully, 1982; Fung, 1981; Hobatho et al., 

1998; Lowet and Van der Perre, 1996; Mehta, et al., 1999; Sedlin, 1966; Viano, 1995). The 

ultrasonic  method used here  is original; the previous techniques used transducers in contact 

with the samples; and samples are often cubes with parallel faces that are difficult to prepare. 

In  this  case,  it  is  difficult  to  cut  cubes  parallel  to  the  fibers  which  are  oriented  at  different 

angles in comparison with the principal axis of the bone. In our case, a rough preparation of 

the  bone  is  sufficient,  the  form  of  the  samples  is  that  of  the  bones  and  the  sample  is  in 

rotation.  Herein,  waves  propagating  both  longitudinally  and  transversally  in  all  the  plane 

directions of bovine femoral bones were used to characterize their mechanical properties. The 

 

1

applications of the ultrasonic control system first developed at the Laboratoire de Mécanique 

et  d’Acoustique  (LMA)  for  ultrasonic  medical  imaging  (Lefebvre,  1988;  Lasaygues  and 

Lefebvre,  2001)  were  extended  to  include  the  elastic  properties  of  biological  systems.  To 

determine the elastic properties of a solid, the theory of elastic waves is essential because it 

relates  the  elastic  moduli  of  a  material  to  the  speed  of  propagation  of  these  waves  along 

arbitrary directions in a solid. The aim of this work is to describe the inversion of ultrasonic 

wavespeed  measurements  on  a  bovine  bone  to  represent  its  elastic  properties  using  a  rapid 

and precise method.  

This experimental method based on theoretical works (Castagnede et al., 1990; Sachse 

et  al.,  1998),  was  adapted  to  the  problem  of  a  transversely  isotropic  material  such  as 

unidirectional  fiber-reinforced  composites  (Lasaygues,  1992)  and  more  recently  to  the 

problem of bone quantitative imaging (Lasaygues et al., 2001).  

The  bench  was  designed  for  performing  both  reflection  and 

transmission 

measurements. Our mechanical acoustic device allows various degrees of freedom, since the 

position of both the target and the transducers can be adjusted. In particular, one can prescribe 

rotation  on  the  target,  and  the  transducer  receiver  can  be  moved  laterally.  This  makes  it 

possible  to  monitor  the  wave  propagation  in  a  system  that  obeys  Snell-Descartes  laws.  The 

mechanical  parameters  of  each  specimen  were  determined  at  various  points  on  specimen 

bones to determine the heterogeneity of the samples. 

 

1. THEORETICAL APPROACH: IDENTIFICATION OF ELASTIC CONSTANTS 

In this study, we focused on bovine bones, considered an elastic medium. Bovine bones have 

a  lamellar  structure  and  are  generally  considered  orthotropic.  However,  we  propose  in  the 

future  to  investigate  human  bones,  which  are  mainly  Haversian,  and  which  are  usually 

considered to be transversely isotropic (Ashman et al., 1984; Yoon and Katz, 1976). We will, 

therefore, investigate bovine bone using theory appropriate for both symmetries. 

1.1 Elastic constants considering the bone as transversely isotropic or orthotropic.

ij denotes the ij component of the stress tensor, and e kl represents the components of 

the strain infinitesimal tensor. The 21 coefficients Cijkl in (1) characterize the stiffness matrix 

elastic constants. Only five or nine independent elements were determined, however, because 

cortical bone microstructure has a hexagonal symmetry.  

1.1.1 Material considered as transversely isotropic 

Axis (0X3) was taken to be the fiber axis. The material was assumed isotropic in the (0X1X2) 

plane (perpendicular to the fibers). By determining the propagation in a direction in the plane 

(0X1X2),  we  can  therefore  measure  the  longitudinal  and  transversal  velocities  in  this  plane 

and deduce constants C11, C66, (Rose, 1999) such as:

Once  these  coefficients  are  determined,  we  can  deduce  the  others.  If  we  determine  the 

propagation  in  a  direction  (0X1)  (resp  (0X2)),  we  can  measure  longitudinal  and  transversal

2.MATERIALS - METHODS 

2.1 Experiments 

It  is  clear  from  the  theory  presented  before  that  wavespeed  data  should  be  collected  over  a 

broad range of arbitrary directions in a specimen in order to recover the whole set of elastic 

constants. 

The general architecture (Fig. 1) of the mechanical system is composed of a main symmetric 

arm holding two transverse arms that move two transducers in parallel. Angular scanning is 

carried out by rotating either the main arm or the object holder. The transducers can also be 

positioned  and  oriented  precisely;  such  precision  allows  for  both  linear  and  sectorial 

scanning.  All  the  movements  are  produced  by  six  stepping  motors  sequentially  driven  by  a 

programmable  translator-indexer  device  fitted  with  a  power  multiplexer.  The  translator-

£
indexer and the power multiplexer are integrated in a control rack with other remote controls, 

such as that for adjusting the distance traveled by the transverse arms, or for the out-of-water 

setting.  The  increments  are  multiples  of  0.75  10-2  millimeters  for  translations  and  of  1  10-2 

degrees for rotations (Lasaygues and Lefebvre, 2001). 3 mm focused transducers were used 

with a central frequency of 1 MHz.  

Ten  fresh  bovine  femoral  bones  were  studied.  The  bones  were  frozen  prior  to  the 

experiments. The epiphyses were cut off so that we could concentrate our attention only on 

compact bone. The method does not require the use of samples with precise dimensions and 

perfectly  parallel  faces:  rough  preparations  of  the  specimen  are  sufficient.  The  area  under 

investigation  must  have  interfaces,  which  are  approximately  parallel  (focus  of  the 

transducers). 

Two test-pieces were obtained by first cutting bones in the axial direction and then removing 

the  marrow  from  each  part  (Fig.  5.a-e).  The  sample,  set  in  water  at  room  temperature,  was 

held  by  the  robot  in  either  the  horizontal  or  vertical  position,  depending  on  the  type  of 

experiment.  Four  series  of  measurements  were  performed  on  each  sample:  two  reflection 

series  (one  on  each  longitudinal  side)  to  determine  the  acoustical  thickness,  and  two 

transmission series (one with the target motionless and one with it rotating) to determine the 

longitudinal and transversal velocity.  

2.2 Acoustic measurement of the bone thickness. 

The  bone  thickness  was  first  calculated  using  the  echo  technique  with  transducers  used  as 

both the transmitter and receiver. Let d be the distance between the two transducers, t1 and t2 

be the time taken by the reflected echo to travel between each of the bone surfaces, and Cw be 

the water velocity (Fig. 2.a). 

The acoustical thickness x is then given by the following relation:

2.3. Calculating the longitudinal and transversal velocity 

We  investigated  the  transmission  mode  to  determine  the  longitudinal  and  transversal 

velocities.  For  this  purpose,  pure  compression  waves  were  emitted.  The  longitudinal  and 

transversal waves in the test-piece were then determined versus the incidence angle i. First, a 

reference measurement was obtained without any bone sample to determine Cw, tw. Then with 

the  bone  sample  the  longitudinal  and  transversal  velocities  were  determined  by  rotating  the 

bone around the clamp axis so as to change the incidence of the acoustic beam. The emitter 

was  fixed  and  the  receiver  could  be  moved  laterally  (Fig.  2.b).  We  define  ic  as  the  critical 

angle such that:

ones. 

When i < ic, we can observe the longitudinal waves and when i > ic, we can see the transversal 

The analyzed zone corresponds to the lateral resolution of the focused transducers (3 mm) and 

we assume that locally the input-output interfaces of the wave are parallel (Fig. 3). We can 

therefore apply Snell-Descartes laws. 

According to the Snell Descartes laws, the refraction index is given by

structure). 

To  obtain  accurate  results  by  taking  bone  heterogeneity  into  account,  we  used  a  1  MHz 

frequency with focused transducers. Focused transducers made it possible to focus on small 

surfaces and to perform measurements at different points (Fig. 5) on the bone sample. In this 

case,  CT  was  measured  in  the  two  radial  directions  of  the  bone.  To  be  able  to  observe 

transversal and longitudinal waves separately and because the critical angle  ci

 was between

, we prescribed series of one-degree rotation on the bone samples with a total 

angular  rotation  of  60°.  First,  to  accurately  describe  the  bone  heterogeneity,  we  took 

ultrasonic  measurements  in  various  points,  brought  closer  to  each  other  (Fig.  5),  so  the 

heterogeneity of the medium could be taken rigorously into account. Two examples of results 

are  presented  with  samples  in  the  vertical  and  horizontal  positions  (Table  1).  In  parallel  to 

this,  we  measured  CL  and  CT  of  the  two  samples  positioned  in  radial  axes  (Table  1).

Considering  the  CT,  compact  zone  of  the  bovine  bones  was  weakly  heterogeneous  (for 

example, we obtained the same values for three points of the bone 2 in horizontal position). 

In another experimental setup, we measured the velocities CL and CT in radial axes and in the 

longitudinal axis of two other fresh bovine bones (bone 3 and 4) (Table 2). The transversely 

isotropic hypothesis was adopted in this case. The results are summarized in the first column 

of the tables 2 and 3. 

3.2. Transversal and longitudinal velocities in three bone directions (orthotropic structure). 

Here both CL and CT were measured in the two radial and the longitudinal axes of the bone. In 

this case, the orthotropic hypothesis was adopted. Measurements were made in bones 3 and 4. 

The results are summarized in the second column of the tables 2 and 3. The matrix rigidity 

values in 3.1 and 3.2 were found to be similar and reproducible. The radial values showed low 

variability, as those in 3.1. When we considered the compact bone as transversely isotropic or 

orthotropic,  the  longitudinal  velocities  in  the  direction  of  the  fibers  (between  4000  m/s  and 

4400 m/s) were greater than those in the radial direction (between 3000 m/s and 3600 m/s). 

On the contrary, we had a similar variation of the transversal velocities in the radial direction 

(between 1700 m/s and 2100 m/s) and in the direction of the fibres (between 1900 m/s and 

2100 m/s). 

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 

In  the  literature  (Ashman,  et  al.,  1984;  Bonfield  and  Tully,  1982;  Fung,  1981;  Katz  et  al., 

1979,  1984;  Lipson  et  al.,  1984;  Reilly  and  Burstein,  1975;  Viano,  1995,  Yoon  and  Katz, 

1976),  the  coefficients  of  matrix  rigidity  and  longitudinal  velocity  values  for  compact  bone 

vary widely. The longitudinal velocity values have varied between 2700 m/s and 4200 m/s, 

9

 

 

 

ours ranged between 2900 m/s and 4400 m/s. The elastic constants were also compared with 

those in the literature (Table 4).  

In  the  experiments,  only  a  few  measurement  points  were  used  so  it  was  difficult  to  finely 

analyze  the  distribution  of  the  bone  characteristics  in  different  regions  of  the  samples.  To 

overcome  this  problem,  one  approach  consists  in  making  a  map  of  longitudinal  and 

transversal velocities of the sample.  

We did not study the viscosity of the sample. To determine whether any dispersion occurs in 

bones, such a study should determine the velocities and attenuation at various frequencies. 

Until  now,  the  elastic  characteristics  of  bones  have  been  measured  by  mechanical  tests 

(compression,  tension,  flexion,  torsion).  With  these  tests,  there  is  a  risk  of  damaging  the 

sample, rendering it unsuitable for tests in other directions or for other measurements. In this 

study, the elastic characteristics of compact bone were measured using an ultrasonic method. 

One of the advantages of the present method is that it gives fast accurate results. Moreover it 

does  not  require  that  samples  have  precise  dimensions  and  perfectly  parallel  faces.  Rough 

preparations  of  the  specimen  are  sufficient.  The  only  requirement  is  for  the  area  under 

investigation  to  have  interfaces  that  are  approximately  parallel.  We  consistently  used  the 

same  experimental  procedure  on  bone  samples  from  animals  of  the  same  age  (about  five 

years),  sex  (female),  and  weight  (about  4  hundred  kilos).  The  ultrasonic  method  proposed 

here  is  an  original  approach  to the study of bone characteristics because the bone is free to 

rotate  around  the  clamp  axis.  This  makes  it  possible  to  monitor  the  wave  propagation,  to 

measure  shear  waves,  and  to  determine  the  velocities  of  these  waves  (CT)  in  all  the 

longitudinal and radial directions and for all the angles of rotation of the samples. The latter 

point is an original feature that classical ultrasonic methods do not provide. 

The  longitudinal  velocity  and  coefficients  of  matrix  rigidity  obtained  here  are  in  line  with 

those in the literature.  

 

10

We also intend to apply these results to construct quantitative images of compact, cancellous 

bones  and  osteoporosis  bones  (Lasaygues  and  Lefebvre,  2001).  Lastly,  the  results  of  this 

study may be used in a numerical model of bones that was developed to analyze failure in this 

structure (Pithioux, 2000).

Abstract:  The  contribution  of  parity-violating  effects  to  the  phase  transition  of  the  D-/L-alanine  crystals  was 
confirmed  by  1H  CRAMPS  solid  state  NMR,  DC-magnetic  susceptibilities  and  ultrasonic  measurements.  It  was 
found that the spin relaxation mechanism of α-H nucleus of D-alanine molecule is different from L-alanine and the 
effect is stronger than that of L-alanine. In addition, D-alanine undergoes a magnetic phase transition at a field of 
1.0T, which is confirmed by a peak-form ultrasonic attenuation curve. DC-magnetic susceptibilities measurements 
of  L-alanine  also  indicate  abnormal  magnetic  properties,  which  is  accompanied  by  a  step-form  ultrasonic 
attenuation jump and its mechanism seems different from that of D-alanine. The phase transition is considered to 
act as a cooperating amplification mechanism of the P-odd effects at the molecular level.   
 

1.  Introduction.  -  The  parity–violating  energy  difference  (PVED)  has  become  important  not  only  to  explain  the 
selection  of  the  L-amino  acids  in  the  origin  of  life,  but  also  as  a  “molecular  footprint”  of  fundamental  physics[1]. 
Since Rein[2] and Letokhov[3] first suggested that the electroweak interaction would lift the degeneracy enantiomers 
predicted by normal quantum electrodynamics, a number of calculations of the PVED for small molecules have been 
published.[4-8]  In  fact,  while  parity  violation  induced  by  weak  neutral  current  (WNC)  is  a  well  established  fact  in 
atoms physics[9], proof of the existence of a phenomena, which would arise from weak nuclear force in molecules, 
has not been reported  yet. And it  seems  likely  that  the  cause  for  the  homochirality  of  biological  molecules  can be 
assigned to the intrinsic chirality present at the elementary particle level. [10-12] 

Recently published ab initio results showed that PVED is calculated by configuration interaction singles (CIS) to 
be larger by one to two orders of magnitude than anticipated by the earlier single determinant excitation-restricted 
Hartree-Fock  (RHF)  methods.[4]  Results,  from  other  research  groups,[5,7,8,13]  concerning  biologically  relevant 
molecules, confirm larger PVED values and again indicate an energetic preference for the L-amino acids and D-sugar, 
which has sparked renewed interest in the experimental search parity violating (P-odd) effects in molecules.   

However,  Quack  et  al  [4]concluded  that,  in  addition  to  parity  violating  potentials  being  frequently  more  than  an 
order of magnitude larger than previously calculated, earlier conclusions on the PVEDs of amino acids and sugars 
“are  uncertain  even  with  respect  to  the  sign.” [10,14,15]  In  2000  Quack  et  al  introduced  a  multi  configuration  linear 
reoponse  (MC-LR)  approach  to  parity  violating  effects  for  alanine  in  the  gas  and  solution  phase,  and  provided  no 
support whatsoever for a systematic accessible conformations.[16] Meanwhile, Schwerdtfeger et al [17] also calculated 
parity-violating energy shifts for the 13 stable conformers of gaseous alanine and indicated that naturally occurring 
L-alanine  is  preferred  for  only  seven  of  the  investigated  thirteen  structures.  Clearly,  fundamental  theoretical 
ambiguities currently exist in ab initio calculations both as to the magnitudes and even the directions of any PVED 

stabilization  of  these  biopolymers.  The  question    “D-  or  L-alanine  which  is  lower  in  energy”  is  reopened  a 
discussion by theoretical physicists.[16] 

A  novel phase  transition  of  D-  and  L-alanine  crystal  was  first  recognized by  specific heat  measurement  with 
differential scanning calorimetry.[18] We select single crystal of alanine, which is a condensed state, to search for 
the P-odd effects between enantiomers to avoid the complicated conformational changes and solvent effects. The 
temperature dependent 1H CRAMPS solid state NMR measurements, DC-magnetic susceptibilities and ultrasonic 
attenuation experiments were performed.

2.  Experimental:  Sample  preparation/characterization.D-/L-alanine  single  crystals  were  characterized  by 
elemental analysis (C, H and N) and a good agreement was shown between the theoretical and experimental data. 
By using X-ray diffraction crystallography at 293K, the cell dimensions of D-/ L-alanine crystals were determined 
as the same space group P21P21P21, orthorhombic, a = 6.0250 Å, b = 12.3310 Å, c = 5.7841 Å, V = 429.72 Å3, It 
indicates that D-alanine and L-alanine are pure single crystals containing no crystal water. The rotation angle ζ of 
the D- and L- alanine solution was measured on Polarimeter PE-241 MC at 293 K with the wavelength of 589.6 

nm. By using the formula of [ α ] = ζ /(L × C), the corresponding α values of D- and L-alanine were shown to be 
the same. 
 

1H CRAMPS solid state NMR measurements. 1H NMR multipulse spectra were run on a Varian InfinityPlus–400 
spectrometer with resonance frequency 400.12 MHz. A 4mm Chemagnetics double probe was used for the variable 

temperature CRAMPS experiment. A BR-24 multiple sequence was employed with a π/2 pulse width of 1.6 µs and 
64 scans with a 2s recycle delay to acquire CRAMPS spectra. Spin rate was 2.5 kHz and the number of scans was 
64. Chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) for 1H measurements.

Fig 1. Temperature dependence of peak widths of 

-H, 

-H of D-/L-alanine crystals 

For  the  sake  of  investigating  the  temperature-dependent  nuclei  dynamics  of  D-  and  L-alanine  molecules,  we 

measured the width of α-H and β-H peaks of D-/L-alanine. Fig.3 displays that four peak’s width of α-H and β-H 
experience  distinct  maximum  around  240K.  So  we  conjecture  that  both  D-/L-alanine  may  undergo  a  phase 
transition at this temperature range. 

-H, 

As  for  the  L-alanine,  the  variation  degrees  of  peak  widths  of

-H  peaks  make  a  good  agreement  (the 
maximum  peak  width  is  about  two  times  as  large  as  that  in  room  temperature)  in  the  whole  process,  which 
indicates that the temperature-dependent relaxation effects of 
-H nuclei of L-alanine molecule are nearly 
the same in the transition process. In the case of D-alanine, the variation of 
-H peak width is much fiercer than 
that of its enantiomer in the transition temperature range (220~250K), in addition, its transition temperature seems 
nearer  to  240K  instead  of  230K.  Considering  the  relative  stability  of  magnetic  field  in  the  whole  experimental 
process,  these  results  show  that,  in  this  specific  transition,  the  spin-spin  relaxation  and  spin-lattice  relaxation 
mechanism  of 
-H  nucleus  of  D-alanine  molecule  may  be  different  from  that  of  L-alanine,  and  its  relaxation 
effects may also stronger than its enantiomer.

DC-Magnetic  susceptibilities  measurements.  Magnetic  moment  (m)  and  magnetic  susceptibility  (χρ)  of  D-/ 
L-alanine crystals were measured by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-5) from 200K to 300K at 
a field of 1.0T (with differential sensitivity 1E-8 emu to 1 Tesla) in the National Laboratory for Superconductivity,

baseline  resolution  of  the  magnetometer,  the  sample  crystal  was  held  directly  in  the  center  of  the  plastic  straw 
purely by friction without using a sample holder. Crystals were weighed and determined to be 174.1mg (D-alanine), 
99.5mg  (L-alanine),  then  transferred  to  the  straw.  The  signal  from  the  plastic  straw  was  canceled  out  while  the 
temperature was measured.

Fig. 2. Temperature dependence of mass susceptibility at a field of 1.0 T 

Magnetization  measurements  (shown  in  Fig.2)  have  shown  alanine  enantiomers  to  be  dimagnetic,  since  they 
have  even  numbers  of  electrons  which  form  closed  magnetically  neutral  shells.  It  is  clearly  indicated  that,  both 
values  and  variations  of  magnetic  susceptibilities  of  D-/  L-  alanine  enantiomers  keep  the  same  when  the 
temperature  is  above  240K,  and  there  is  not  distinct  difference  between  them.  It  can  also  be  found  that,  when 
temperature approach 240K from higher ones, the change of χρ    values becomes slow and subsiding. On the other 
hand, when the temperature falls below 240K, D-alanine undergoes a magnetic phase transition as the χρ    values 
showed  a  maximum  near  240K,  while  χρ    values  of  L  -alanine  go  on  increasing  but  the  rate  of  variation 
experiences an abrupt rise, which should also be looked as a magnetic phase transition and its mechanism is clearly 
distinct with that of D-alanine crystal. The experimental results are repeatable for the same samples after several 
thermal  circles  from  200K  to  300K,  and  both  the  magnitudes  of χρ    values  and  the  transition  temperatures  of 
D-alanine  crystal  are  almost  the  same  for  the  different  thermal  circles,  which  indicates  that  these  changes  are 
completely reversible for D- and L-alanine crystals. 

Meaningfully,  while  the  temperature  varies  in  the  range  of  200~240K, χρ    values  of  D-/L-  alanine  are  nearly 
opposite  and symmetry  with  the χρ    value  (χρ=  –  5.185×10-7 cm3/g)  of  D-/L-  alanine at 240K taken  as the  base 
value,  which  may  show  some  clues  for  the  weak  neutral  current  playing  a  contrary  even  parity-violating  role  in 
magnetic behavior of molecules of D-alanine and L-alanine crystals in this temperature range.   
 
    Ultrasonic attenuation measurements. The measurements of ultrasonic attenuation values of D-/L-alanine were 
performed on a computer controlled ultrasonic system (Matec model 7700). A ceramic transducer for generating a 

longitudinal ultrasonic wave was used. The frequency of ultrasonic wave is 5 MHz. The attenuation α value was 
calculated from

where  d  is  the  thickness  of  the  sample,  A(x1)  and  A(x2)  are  the  amplitudes  of  the  first  and  second  echoes

between  them.  The  temperature  of  the  sample  was  controlled  by  a  thermocouple.  In  this  way  we  can  gain  the 
ultrasonic  attenuation  values  at  various  temperatures.  For  the  sake  of  detecting  and  describing  the  difference  of 
both phase transitions mechanisms more precisely, relative attenuation values curve for either enantiomer was drew,

Fig.3 The relative attenuation values of D-/L-alanine crystals vs its temperature 

The results of ultrasonic measurements are shown in Figure.3. As for the D-alanine crystal, the attenuation value 
changes continuously and undergoes an obvious peak around 247K, and the curve is symmetry on the whole. In the 
case  of  L-alanine  crystal,  a  precipitous  step-form  drop  of  attenuation  value  was  found  around  247K.  These 
ultrasonic  attenuation  phase  transition  temperatures  agree  with  the  1H  Solid  state  NMR  and  DC-magnetic 
susceptibilities measurements. It is quite clear that, for these two crystal samples, the shapes of relative attenuation 
curves  of  the  enantiomers  and  transition  mechanisms  are  quite  different  from  each  other.  So  we  suppose  the 
ultrasonic investigations demonstrate the contribution of the parity-violating WNC to the elastic relaxation effects 
acting in both ultrasonic transitions of D-alanine and L-alanine crystals. 

Although the specific and detailed transition mechanisms which involve the parity-violating WNC is unclear, the 
above experimental results show that the behaviors of D-/L-alanine differ from each other in the nuclei, molecule 
and crystal aspects, respectively. 
 

  3.Results and DiscussionsFor the PVED scales to the fifth power of the nuclear charge of the heaviest atom in 
the  molecule,[11]  a  few  researchers  synthesized  and  measured  some  compounds  which  contain  heavier 
2+ 
elements,[19,20]  and  for  instance,  very  recently  Lahamer  et  al  [20]reported  a  small  energy  shift  of  the  Fe(phen)3
mossbauer  spectra  for  the  two  enantiomers  of  0.004 0.002  mm/sec  (1.9×10-10  ev)  which  is  larger  than  the 
theoretical calculations. The predicted ratio of the PVED is exceedingly small (10-18) for alanine molecule without 
heavy  element  effects,  and  this  extraordinary  slight  nuance  is  quite  difficult  to  be  detected  if  without  any 
amplification mechanism for the gas and solution properties of alanine.[21] However, the influence and contribution 
of PVED in phase transition process of D-/L- alanine crystals, demonstrated by 1H solid state NMR, DC-Magnetic 
susceptibilities and ultrasonic measurements, is evident and significant. It has been argued that symmetry breaking 
could occur in condensed media in which a large number of particles can cooperate to produce a sharp transition 
between symmetric and asymmetric states of the samples.[22] So we conjecture that the phase transition may act as 

 

4 

a  cooperating  amplification  mechanism  of  the  P-odd  effects  at  the  molecular  level,  of  which  mechanism,  Salam 
suggested, was the Bose condensation. 

In  1991  Salam[23,24]  proposed  that  the  subtle  energy  difference  of  chiral  molecules  induced  by  Z0  interactions 
combined with Bose condensation may cause biochirality among twenty amino acids. It makes up proteins to be a 
consequence of second order phase transition below a critical temperature Tc. From Ginzburg-Landau equation, the 
value of temperature Tc is deduced: 
                                    < ϕ > 

      Tc  =           

exp [-2/geff σ(1-4sin2 θ)] ≈ 2.5×102 K 

 

                                    10 3   
Here ϕ field is expressed as a complex auxiliary Higgs scalar field, geff    is an attractive coupling constant between 
2  with  the 
spin  up  and  spin  down  electrons,  θ  is  the  Weinberg  angle.  Salam  took  (1-4sin2  θ)  ≈  1/13,  σ(0)=mz
empirical value of the parameter sin2θ ≈ 0.231, and got geff σ(0) ≈ 1. 
    In 1995 Figureau et al.[25] conducted some experiments to test the validity of Salam’s prediction. After exposing 
both racemic and optically active cystine to temperatures ranging from 77 to 0.1K for differing time periods they 
observed  no  changes  in  optical  rotation,  thus  reported  failing  to  validate  Salam’s  predicted  phase  transitions. 
However,  after  the  cooling  period  the  samples  were  taken  out  of  the  cryostat,  heated  and  dissolved  at  room 
temperature in HCl solution, so their observing no optical rotation can only prove that the Salam phase transition 
can not be a irreversible one, but it is not a negative evidence while the transition is reversible. 

The phase transitions of D-/L- alanine crystal discovered by our measurements are completely reversible and our 
measurements  are  also  on-line,  in  addition,  the  phase  transition  temperatures  (240-250K)  are  so  considerably 
agreed with the theoretical estimation in Salam hypothesis, so we surmise that the phase transition may have some 
relation with the one Salam predicted.   

Recently,  the  authors[26]  succeed  in  detecting  the  cause  of  a  chemical  reaction  using  a  magnetic  field  (in 
combination with unpolarized light) to the preferential production of one of the two possible enantiomers, which 
led  to  an  enantiometic  excess.  The  significance  of  the  these  findings  is  that  now  magnetochial  anisotropy,  apart 
from photochemistry with circularly polarized light and the electroweak interaction, has been a third candidate for 
the  origin  of  homochirality.[27,28]  In  our  measurements,  the  phenomena,  that  D-/L-alanine  crystals  in  low 
temperature have quite different χρ    values and reverse variation directions, have been found to be accompanied 
by the contribution of the parity-violating WNC. This may provide a new sight into the relation between these two 
candidates for the origin of homochirality: magnetochirality and the electroweak interaction.   

As  we  have  discussed  above,  in  this  specific  transition,  the  spin  relaxation  mechanism  of 

-H  nucleus  of 
D-alanine molecule may be different from that of L-alanine, and its effects may also stronger than its enantiomer; 
in  higher  temperature  the  magnetic  susceptibilities  of  D-/L-alanine  crystals  are  almost  the  same;  while  the 
temperature  below  240K,  because  of  the  P-odd  amplification  mechanism  of  the  phase  transition, χρ    values  of 
enantiomers are quite different and vary in reverse directions; in addition, the ultrasonic transition mechanisms of 
alanine enantiomers are also far from each other, which is an affirmative evidence of parity violation at molecular 
level. Nevertheless, both questions, that the connection between the phase transitions and the one Salam predicted, 
and the relation between magnetochirality and the electroweak interaction, are very subtle and still open.

ABSTRACT 
 

Fundamental  interactions  (FI)  represent  the  core  of  physical  World  Picture,  compose  the  basis  of 
observed in Universe phenomena and flowing in it processes. In the frame of Wave Universe Concept (WU 
Concept)  it  is  pointed  to  essential  features  of  observed  FI  set  -  its  hierarchy,  isomorphysm,  recurrence 
character. Hierarchy of a

(k) fundamental interactions (FI) is shown by the (infinite) Homological series

IN SEARCH OF WORLD PICTURE. 
 

Earth  and  Heaven,  Universe,  phenomena  and  its  constituted  objects  -  that  are  invariable  subjects  of 

observation by man - Homo Sapiens and Homo Instrumentalis - in the course of the whole of history. 

Modern  science,  essentially,  is  only  continuation  of  this  nonexpire,  all  swallowing  tendency.  The  actual 
science differs from the past maybe only by possibility to set up of more comlex, often, grand experiments, by 
possibility to use of more wide data base and array of accumulated knowledge. 

Setting up of more new and new experiments, of course, - is not a self - aim. Beyond all of this invariable 
tendency remains to create the ordered, well-proportioned World Picture (or, as say ancients - Imago Mundi), 
among them, and picture of early inaccessible to experiments phenomena of subatomic world. That is aim, 
undoubtly, worthy of man, great and, possible, completely impracticable. 

COMPONENTS OF MODERN PHYSICAL WORLD PICTURE. 
FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS. 
 

Set of observed objects and phenomena of Universe strikes an imaginations. The modern science, will be 
say, the Standard Model suggests, that beyond all this brightly and infinite phenomenology the resrict set only 
four fundamental interactions (FI) - strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitational (interactions) stands.

In connection with the physical World Picture, which is described to us by the modern science - physics 

and cosmology, some natural questions of unbiased reseachers may be arised: 

#  Why,  according  to  modern  physics  representation,  only  four  (not  less,  not  more)  fundamental 

interactions (FI) exist?  

# Why charges of known FI have namely these, not another values? 
# By what its are motivated? 
# If exists any causal (and analytical) connection between FI of different ranges? 
# Why so extremal difference between absolute values of electromagnetic and gravitational FI exists? 
Questions may be multipliced...

WAVE UNIVERSE CONCEPT AND FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS. 
 
Hierarchycal Structure of Universe. 

One  of  most  bright,  evident  phenomenon  of  real  Universe  is  its  hierarchycal  structure.  In  Universe 

obviously elementar object of matter (EOM) of different scale - atoms, stars, galaxies, etc. are observing. 
 
Matter Levels.  †

† Wave  Universe  Staircase†

  of   Matter. 

That  incontrovertible  fact  takes  inself  natural  reflection  in  the  Wave  Universe  concept  [Checheknitsky, 
1980-1997]. Hierarchy of U(k), k=...-2.-1,0,1,2,... matter Levels form the † Wave Universe Staircase†  of matter. 
In  the  analitical,  mathematical  plane  this  hierarchy  may  be  represented  by  Homological  series  (GS)  of 
characteristic parameters EOM of each Level of matter. 

 

Layers of Matter. 

atoms, particles, etc. 

planets, etc. 

It is evident fact too, that not all Levels of matter equally brightly represent in observations. In that sense 
most brightly in real Universe its are manifested only some clasters of close situated matter Levels, it will be 
say, Layers of matter. Most characteristic from its are 

#  Atomic  (subatomic)  Layer  of  matter.  It  contain  some  Levels  of  matter,  connected  with  populations  of 

#  Stellar  (Star)  Layer  of  matter.  It  contain  some  matter  Levels,  connected  with  populations  of  stars, 

# Galactical Layer of matter. Objects of matter - different galaxies, etc. 

 
Fundamental Parameter of Hierarchy. 

At 70-th in investigation of wave structure of  Solar system [Chechelnitsky, 1980] it have  been  discovered  
significent arguments for existance  of  Shell  structure, hierarchy and similarity - dynamical isomorphysm - of 
Solar system Shells. 

First of all, that concerned to dynamical isomorphysm of clearly observed G

 and G

 Shells, connecting 

[1]

[2]

respectively with I (Earth's) and II (Jovian) groups of planets.  

It  was  determined  that  arrangement  of  physically  distinguished  -  elite  (particularly  powerful,  strong  -
[2]
dominant)  orbits  of  Mercury  in  G
)  Shells  brightly 
underline the similarity of geometry and dynamics of processes, flowing in these Shells, with accuracy up to 
the some scale factor. 

  (and  Jupiter  in  G

  (and  Saturn  in  G

),  Venus  in  G

As  the  quantitative  characteristics  of  that  isomorphysm,  the  recalculation  coefficient  c   -  Fundamental 

parameter of hierarchy (FPH) - may be used the ratio, for instance, of

Universality of FPH. 

Analysis  of  (mega)  wave  structure  of  physically  autonomous  satellite  systems  of  Jupiter,  Saturn,  etc., 
indicated, that discovered c  Fundamental parameter of hierarchy (FPH) plays in its the similar essential role, 
as in the Solar (planetary) system, characterizing the hierarchy, recursion and isomorphysm of Shells. 

Thus,  it  takes  shape  the  essentially  universal  character  of  (FPH)  -  its  validity  for  the  analysis  of  (mega) 

wave structure of any WDS. 

That corresponds to representations, connected with co-dimension principle [Chechelnitsky, 1980, p.245]: 
 [character  value of  sectorial 
"...fundanental fact is that when we pass on to another WDS, the value of d
velocity (action, circulation)] doesn't remain constant, but varies according scales of these systems. This fact 
is the consequence of co-dimension principle..." 

 

"Magic Number" ("Chechelnitsky Number", FPH)  c  = 3.66(6).  
Role and Status of Fundamental Parameter of Hierarchy in Universe. 

Previous  after  primary  publications  [Chechelnitsky,  1980-1985]  time  and  new  investigations  to  the  full 
extent convince the theory expectations, in particular, connected with the G[s] Shells hierarchy in each of such 
WDS,  with  the  hierarchy  of  Levels  of  matter  (and  WDS)  in  Universe,  with  the  exceptional  role  of  the 
introduced in the theory c FPH [Chechelnitsky, (1978) 1980-1986].    

The  very  brief  resume  of  some  aspects  of  these  investigations  may  be  formulated  in  frame  of following 

short suggestion. 
Proposition (Role and Status of c FPH in Universe) [Chechelnitsky, (1978) 1980-1986] 

#  The  central  parameter,  which  organizes  and  orders  the  dynamical  and  physycal  structure,  geometry, 

hierarchy of Universe 

*  "Wave Universe Staircase" of matter Levels, 
*  Internal structure each of real systems - wave dynamic systems (WDS) at any Levels of matter, is 

(manifested oneself) c  - the Fundamental Parameter Hierarchy (FPH) - nondimensional number c  = 3.66(6). 

#  It  may  be  expected,  that  investigations,  can  show  in  the  full  scale,  that  c   -  FPH,  generally  speeking, 
presents and appeares everywhere - in any case,  - in an extremely wide circle of dynamical relations, which 
reflect the geometry, dynamical structure, hierarchy of real systems of Universe. 

We aren't be able now and at once to appear all well-known to us relations and multiple links, in which one 

self the [Chechelnitsky] c  = 3.66(6) "Magic Number" manifests. 

We hope that all this stands (becomes) possible in due time and with new opening opportunities for the 

publications and communications. 
 
HIERARCHY OF MATTER LEVELS AND FUNDAMENTAL INTERACTIONS. 
 

(k) 
In  the  frame  of  Wave  Universe  Concept  (WU  Concept)  it  may  be  suggested  that  hierarchy  of  a
fundamental interactions (FI) corresponds to hierarchy of U(k), k=...-2,-1,0,1,2,... matter Levels. In particular, 
claster  of  neighbouring,  fundamental  interactions  corresponds  to  Atomic  (Subatomic)  Layer  of  matter  -  its 
some matter Levels. Among its the well-known in modern physics strong, weak, electromagnetic interactions 
are most brightly manifested.

In the world physical literature variety of experimental estimations of a

(k) FI values is circulated. We take 
(spare)  the  special  attention  to  those  of  its,  which  describe  some  asimptotical,  limitational  (apparently, 
convergent, fixed, stable) its states. 

For the definitness it would be later named these experimental estimations - as stationary (values). 
 

STRONG INTERACTION. 
 
Constant of Strong FI. 

The developed now experimental situation most brightly and evidently represents the well-known Figure of 
[RPP, 1997, Fig.9.2 in Division † Lattice QCD† ]. It is not difficult to point, that observed in many experiments 
asimptotical, limitational, apperently, stationary value of a s FI constant lie at region 

a s »  0.098 ‚  0.1 
Let cite some  a s values - result of concrete experiments, - quite corresponding to predictions of theory (WU 
Concept). References take from RPP 

# RPP, p.79: "...The result can be combined to give 

a s(Mz)=0.112 –  0.002 –  0.04... 

# RPP, p.80: "...A fit to ¡

, ¡

¢  and ¡

 " gives  

            a s(Mz)=0.108 –  0.001 (expt.) 

# RPP, p. 81: "... the Standard Model is used  

            a s(Mz)=0.104  

# RPP, p. 90:                                     a s(Mz)=0.101 –  0.008 
# RPP, p.90: "...Nonsuper symmetric unified theories predict the low value 

            a s(Mz)=0.073 –  0.001– 0.001 

# RPP, p. 91:                                     a s=0.101(8)  
# RPP, p.105 :                                   a s=0.103 –  0.008 
It is possible another, not less effective way to the determination of the a s FI constant.

WEAK INTERACTION. 
  
Constant of Weak FI. 

It is observed comparatively wide field of a w weak FI estimations. Apparently, this connect with situation 
when  point  some  "intermediate",  not  asimptotical  evaluations,  in  more  degree  depending  from  dynamical 
circumstan cies of experiment (transfer momentum, etc). 
 
Influence of Model Representations. 

It  may  be  suppose  that  incertainity  in  a w  estimations  is  connected  also  with  nonjustified  propositions, 
limitations  and  links  of  developed  theoretical  models  of  weak  FI  (for  instance,  Weinberg-Salam  model),  in 
frame of which the experimental data are calculated and comprehended. This interesting aspect deserves the 
special deep discussion. 
 
Weak Angle of Mixing. Comparision with Experiment. 

Let take as definition the following representation for the q w - Weak angle of mixing (Weinberg angle) 
e/ew = sinq w 

It is wide used in Standard Model (Weinberg - Salam model), and q w - for the comparision of theory and 
experimental data. In frame of discussed WU Concept representations it is not difficult to receive numerical, 
theoretical representation for this angle. From the comparision 

it is followed 

ew

2/e2 = sin-2q w (cid:222)

 c  = 3.66(6) 

sin2q w = 1/c  = 0.272(272), 
sinq w = 0.522(232), q w = 31(cid:176) .48. 

As  the  case  of  preliminary  reason  for  reflection  let  take  only  one  reference  [Perkins,  1991].  In  division 
"Assimetries  of  polarized  electrons  decay  on  deuterons",  it  is  constated  [p.320]:  "...The  final  result  has  the 
form  

sin2q w = 0.22–  0.02 
and is coordinated with previous estimations. However, if save the r  relation of neutral and charged currents 
as a free parameter, then result will be another:  

because r  and sin2q w values are strong correlated...". 

From one side, it is not difficult to point the comporativeness of experimental data 

and WU Concept result 

r  = 1.74–  0.033, 
sin2q w = 0.293 –  0.033 –  0.100, 

sin2q w = 0.22‚ 0.293 

sin2q w = 0.272. 

From  another  side,  these  data  of  experiments  reflect  still  surviving  inconsistency,  sqeezed  in  the 
interpetation  of  experimental  data.  It  seems,  that  results  of  experiments  highly  nonwillingly  invide  in 
imperatives  of  Standard  Models  -  in  restricting  relations  of developed theory. Problem is so interesting and 
entertaining that we intend to return to it with detailed critical analysis of developed sutiation. 

 

Weak Interaction and c

 FPH. 

The  Fundamental  parameter  hierarchy  (c   FPH)  plays  decisive  role  in  hierarchy  of  weak  and 
electromagnetic  FI.  To  be  convinced  in  it,  let  cite  data  of  experiment,  which  point  another  way  for 
experimental definition of a w constant of weak FI. 
 
Dynamical Isomorphysm of Electron and Neutrino Decay (at Nucleons). 

Experiments  with  leptons  (electrons  and  neutrino)  decay  on  nucleons  are  characterized  by  standard 

functions of nucleons

electron - nucleon decay with the same q2... Both data sets coincide each to other, if points of electron decay 
are multipliced by 18/5..." 

Thus, it is observed the dynamical isomorphysm (similarity) of weak and electromagnetic decay processes 

with accuracy to similarity parameter 

It  is  not  difficult  to  comprehand,  that  these  orienting  data  of  experiment,  in  reality,  correspond  to  the    c

This is claster of near lieing Levels of matter. Of course, the † force†  of gravitational FI, corresponding to 
one of matter Levels of Gravitational Layer of matter, is very small in comparision to † forces†  of strong, weak 
and electromagnetic FI.

The  base  for  that  representation  for  a g  gravitational  FI  constant  is  the  following  assumption  of  WU 

Proposition (Gravitation and Electromagnetism). 
# Gravitation and Electromagnetism (as and another FI) in Wave Universe passess by fundamental stable 

wave link, characterized, in particular, by properties of commensurability, stable resonance. 
# Fundamental constants of gravitation and electromagnetism submit to the relation

where e, me  - charge and mass of electron,  G - gravitational constant. 

In  fact,  that  astonishing  relation  points  to  the  new  theoretical  (not  experimental)  representation  of  G 

gravitational constant over characteristic constants of microworld e, me - charge and mass of electron. 

Simultaneously,  it  opens  the  possibility  to  receive  the  explicit  representation  for  the  a g  gravitational  FI 

and corresponding gravitational charge

It is so far remain unknown in the modern physical World Picture and, therefore, still non investigated by 

all available in a modern science intellectual and experimental potential. 

It will be reasonable treat with attention to the indications of theory, a’priori not reject a possibility of search

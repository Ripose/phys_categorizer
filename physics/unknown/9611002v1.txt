Abstract

It is given a way of computing Casimir eigenvalues for Weyl orbits as well as for irreducible representa-
tions of Lie algebras. A κ(s) number of polinomials which depend on rank N are obtained explicitly for AN
Casimir operators of order s where κ(s) is the number of partitions of s into positive integers except 1. It
is also emphasized that these eigenvalue polinomials prove useful in obtaining formulas to calculate weight
multiplicities and in explicit calculations of the whole cohomology ring of Classical and also Exceptional Lie
algebras.

I. INTRODUCTION

2

In a previous paper [1] which we refer (I) throughout the work, we establish the most general explicit
forms of 4th and 5th order Casimir operators of AN Lie algebras. By starting from this point, we want
to develop a framework which makes possible to calculate, for the irreducible representations of AN Lie
algebras, the eigenvalues of Casimir operators in any order. Extensions are also possible to any other
classical or exceptional Lie algebra because any Lie algebra has always an appropriate subalgebra of type
AN .

For a Casimir operator I(s) of degree s, the eigenvalues for a D-dimensional representation are known

to be calculated in the following form:

1
D

T race(I(s)) .

A direct calculation of (I.1) could become problematic in practice as the dimension of representation grows
high. Additionally to the ones given in (I), we give here some further works [2] dealing with this problem.
A second essential problem arisen here is due to the fact that one must also calculate weight multiplicities
for representations comprising more than one Weyl orbit. This latter problem is known to be solved by
formulas which are due to Kostant and Freudenthal [3] and it is at the root of Weyl-Kac character formulas
[4]. Although they are formally explicit, these two formulas are of recursive character and hence they
exhibit problems in practical calculations. One could therefore prefers to obtain a functional formula in
calculating weight multiplicities. This will be dealt in a subsequent paper.

It is known, on the other hand, that trace operations can be deﬁned [5] in two equivalent ways one
of which is nothing but the explicit matrix trace. An expression like (I.1) does therefore not means for a
Weyl orbit, in general. We instead want to extend the concept of Casimir eigenvalue to Weyl orbits. As
we have introduced in an earlier work [6], we replace (I.1) with the following formal deﬁnition:

(I.1)

(I.2)

where Π is a Weyl orbit and the sum is over all weights µ included within Π. The powers of weights in (I.2)
are to be thought of as s-times products

chs(Π) ≡ X
µ∈Π

(µ)s

s times

(µ)s =

µ × µ × ... × µ .
z

}|

{

Note here that (I.2) is deﬁned not only for Weyl orbits or representations but it means also for any collection
of weights. We will mainly show in what follows how (I.2) gives us a way to obtain eigenvalues of a Casimir
operator. Procedure works out especially for AN Lie algebras. This is due to a permutational lemma
concerning AN Weyl orbits only. This will be given in the next section.
In section (III), we will give a
general formula of calculating chs(Π) by the aid of this lemma. An eﬃcient way of using this formula is due
to reduction rules which are explained in section (IV) and the polinomials representing Casimir eigenvalues
will be given in section (V) and also in appendix.2. We will show in section (VI) that the two formula (I.1)
and (I.2) are in fact in coincidence.

II. A PERMUTATIONAL LEMMA FOR AN WEYL ORBITS

In this section, we give, for AN Lie algebras, a permutational lemma which says that, modulo permu-
tations, there is one-to-one correspondence between the Weyl chamber and the Tits cone [7].
As will be explained below, such a correspondence appears only when one reformulates everything in terms
of the so-called fundamental weights.

For an excellent study of Lie algebra technology we refer the book of Humphreys [8]. We give, however,
some frequently used concepts here. In describing the whole weight lattice of a Lie algebra of rank N,
the known picture will be provided by simple roots αi and fundamental dominant weights λi where
indices like i1, i2, .. take values from the set I◦ ≡ {1, 2, ..N }. Any dominant weight Λ+ can then be expressed
by

Λ+ =

ri λi

, ri ∈ Z +

N

X
i=1

(II.1)

3

where Z + is the set of positive integers including zero. We know that a Weyl orbit Π is stable under the
actions of Weyl group of Lie algebra. This means that all weights within a Weyl orbit are equivalent under
the actions of Weyl group and they can be obtained from any one of them by performing Weyl conjugations
one-by-one. We thus obtain a description of the whole weight lattice of which any weight is given by

µ = m1 λ1 + m2 λ2 + ... + mN λN , ±mi ∈ Z + .

(II.2)

Our way of thinking of a Weyl orbit is, on the other hand, in such a way that all its participating
weights are to be determined from its dominant weight without making Weyl reﬂections. It is seen
in the following that essential ﬁgures for this are fundamental weights µI which we introduced [9] some
ﬁfteen years ago:

µ1 ≡ λ1
µi ≡ µi−1 − αi−1 ,

i = 2, 3, ..N + 1.

Indices like I1, I2, ... take values from the set S◦ ≡ {1, 2, ..N, N + 1}. Recall here that the weights deﬁned in
(II.3) are nothing but the weights of (N+1)-dimensional fundamental representations of AN Li e algebras.
To prevent confusion, note here that some authors prefer to call λi’s fundamental weights.Though there are
N+1 number of fundamental weights µI , they are not completely linear independent due to the fact that
their sum is zero. The main observation is, however, that (II.2) replaces with

when one reformulates in terms of N+1 fundamental weights. The conditions

µ = q1 µI1 + q2 µI2 + .. + qN +1 µIN +1

must be taken into account for each particular weight (II.4) and one can always assume that

I1 6= I2 6= .. 6= IN +1

q1 ≥ q2 ≥ ... ≥ qN +1 ≥ 0 .

(II.6) receives here further importance in the light of following lemma:

Let P(N) be the weight lattice of AN Lie algebra. A dominant weight Λ+ ∈ P (N ) has always the form

Λ+ = q1 µ1 + q2 µ2 + .. + qN +1 µN +1

and hence the whole Weyl orbit Π(Λ+) is obtained by permutations of (II.7) over N+1 fundamental weights.
In the basis of fundamental weights all weights of the Weyl orbit Π(Λ+) are thus seen in the common form
(II.4) where all indices Ik take values from the set S◦ together with the conditions (II.5).

Although it is not in the scope of this work, demonstration of lemma is a direct result of the deﬁnitions
(II.3). It will be useful to realize the lemma further in terms of (N+1)-tuples which re-deﬁne (II.7) in the
form

Λ+ ≡ (q1, q2, ..qN +1) .

(II.8)

Then every elements µ ∈ Π(Λ+) corresponds to a permutation of q′

is:

µ = (qI1 , qI2, .., qIN +1)

of

.

To this end, let us choose a weight

which is expressed in the conventional form (II.2). By taking inverses

−λ1 + 2 λ2 − λ3 + λ4 + λ5 − λ6 + λ7

λi ≡ µ1 + µ2 + ... + µi

,

i ∈ I◦

(II.3)

(II.4)

(II.5)

(II.6)

(II.7)

(II.9)

(II.10)

of (II.2), we can re-express (II.9) as

4

2µ1 + 3 µ2 + µ3 + 2 µ4 + µ5 + µ7

(II.11)

which says us that

−λ1 + 2 λ2 − λ3 + λ4 + λ5 − λ6 + λ7 ∈ Π(λ1 + λ3 + λ6) .

It is obvious that this last knowledge is not so transparent in (II.9).

One must further emphasize that the lemma allows us to know the dimensions of Weyl orbits directly

from their dominant representatives, as in the example given above:

dimΠ(λ1 + λ3 + λ6) =

(N + 1)!
(1 − 0)! (3 − 1)! (6 − 3)! (N + 1 − 6)!

.

Note here that the right hand side of this expression is calculated solely from the weight Λ ≡ λ1 + λ3 + λ6.
We therefore assume in the following that the number dimΠ(Λ) of weights included within a Weyl orbit
Π(Λ) is always known to be a polinomial of rank N.

III. EIGENVALUES FOR WEYL ORBITS

Let us ﬁrst extend the eigenvalue concept to Weyl orbits. As is mentioned above, eigenvalues are, in
fact, known to be deﬁned for representations. A representation R(Λ+) is, on the other hand, determined
from its orbital decomposition:

R(Λ+) = Π(Λ+) + X

m(λ+ < Λ+) Π(λ+)

(III.1)

λ+∈S(Λ+)

where S(Λ+) is the set of all sub-dominant weights of Λ+ and m(λ+ < Λ+)’s are multiplicities of weights
λ+ within the representation R(Λ+). Once a convenient deﬁnition of eigenvalues is assigned to Π(λ+) for
λ+ ∈ S(Λ+), it is clear that this also means for the whole R(Λ+) via (III.1). In the rest of this section, we
then show how deﬁnition (I.2) can be used to obtain orbit eigenvalues as N-dependent polinomials.

Let us now make some deﬁnitions which are used frequently for description of symmetric polinomials
encountered in the root expansions which take place heavily in the recently studied electromagnetically dual
supersymmetric theories [10]. These will, of course, be given here in terms of fundamental weights µI . The
essential role will be played by generators

µ(s) ≡

(µI )s , s = 1, 2, ...

N +1

X
I=1

and their reductive generalizations

µ(s1, s2, .., sk) ≡

(µI1 )s1 (µI2 )s2 ... (µIk )sk

.

N +1

X
I1,I2,..Ik=1

For (III.3), the conditions

s1 ≥ s2 ≥ ... ≥ sk

are always assumed and no two of indices I1, I2, ..Ik shall take the same value for each particular monomial.
Note also that µ(s, 0, 0, ..0) = µ(s).

As the ﬁrst step, we now make the suggestion, in view of (I.2), that orbit eigenvalues can be conveniently
calculated by decomposing chs(Π) in terms of quantities deﬁned in (III.3) and this provides us the possibility
to calculate orbit eigenvalues with the same ability regardless

( i) the rank N of algebra,
( ii) the dimension dimR(Λ+, N ) of irreducible representation,
(iii) the order s of Casimir element.

(III.2)

(III.3)

(III.4)

To give our results below, we will assume that the set

5

s/k ≡ {s1, s2, ..., sk}

(III.5)

represents, via (III.4), all partitions

s = s1 + s2 + ... + sk

,

s ≥ k

of positive integer s to k-number of positive integers s1, s2, ..sk. It is useful to remark here that each particular
partition participating within a s/k gives us a dominant weight in P(N) and the whole subdominant chain
S(s λ1) is in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions within a s/k. This must always be kept in mind
in the following considerations.

On the other hand, instead of (II.1), it is crucial here to use (II.7) in the form

Λ+ ≡

qi µi

σ

X
i=1

(III.6)

where σ = 1, 2, ..N + 1. Due to permutational lemma given above, we now know that all weights of a Weyl
orbit are speciﬁed with the same parameters qi, (i = 1, 2, ..σ). It is only of this fact which allows us to obtain
the following formula in expressing orbital eigenvalues:

Ωs(q1, q2, ..., qσ, N ) =

(N + 1 − k)! (symmetry f actorials) F actors(s/k)

(III.7)

1
(N + 1 − σ)!

σ

X
k=1

where for all possible partitions (s/k) we deﬁne

F actors(s/k) ≡ M (s1, s2, ..., sk) q(s1, s2, ..., sk) µ(s1, s2, ..., sk)

(III.8)

with a symmetry factorial j! for each possible subset of indices (si+1, .., si+j) with the same numerical value
si+1 = si+2 = .. = si+j , (j=1,2,...). We deﬁne here the multinomial

M (s1, s2, ..., sk) ≡

(s1 + s2 + ... + sk)!
s1!s2!...sk!

together with the condition that

M (s1, s2, ..., sk) ≡ 0 f or

s < k.

(III.9)

As in exactly the same way in (III.3), we also deﬁne

q(s1, s2, .., sk) ≡

(qI1 )s1 (qI2 )s2 ... (qIk )sk

.

(III.10).

σ

X
s1,s2,..sk=1

One must emphasize that (III.7) is quite restricted in the sense that only the deﬁnitions

chs(q1, q2, ..., qk, N ) =

Ωs(q1, q2, ..., qk, N )

(III.11)

symmetry f actorials

are valid for all cases q1 ≥ q2 ≥ .. ≥ qk.

from (III.7).

For cases which we consider in this work, we will give in appendix.1 some exemplary expressions extracted

IV. REDUCTION FORMULAS

6

Although it has an explicit form, the simplicity of formula (III.7) is not so transparent to an experienced
eye looking for its advanced applications. This point can be recovered by recursively reducing the quantities
(III.9) up to generators µ(s) deﬁned in (III.2). We call these reduction rules. We will only give the ones
which we need in the sequel. It would however be useful to mention about some of their general features.
As is known, elementary Schur functions Sk(x) are deﬁned by expansions

Sk(x) zk ≡ exp

xk zk

X
k∈Z+

∞

X
k=1

with the following explicit expressions:

Sk(x) = X

k1+2 k2+3 k3..=k

xk1
1
k1!

xk2
2
k2!

...

,

k > 0 .

(IV.2)

The complete symmetric functions hk(µ1, µ2, ..µN ) are deﬁned, on the other hand, by

N

Y
i=1

1
(1 − z µi)

≡ X
k≥0

hk(µ1, µ2, ..µN ) zk .

It can be easily shown that the known equivalence

is now conserved by the reduction rules with the aid of a simple replacement

hk(µ1, µ2, ..µN ) ≡ Sk(x)

µ(s) → s xs .

A simple but instructive example concerning (IV.4) for k=4 is

h4(µ1, µ2, µ3, µ4) = µ(4) + µ(3, 1) + µ(2, 2) + µ(2, 1, 1) + µ(1, 1, 1, 1)

(IV.5)

with the corresponding reduction rules

q(1)2 q(2) +

q(2)2 − q(1) q(3) + q(4) ,

q(2)2 +

For other cases of interest, the reduction rules will be given in appendix.1 respectively for the partitions of
5,6 and 7.

V. EXISTENCE OF EIGENVALUE POLINOMIALS

After all these preparations, we are now in the position to bring out the most unexpected part of work.
This is the possibility to extend (III.11) directly for irreducible representations as well as Weyl orbits. We
will show in a subsequent work that this gives us the possibility to obtain inﬁnitely many functional formulas
to calculate weight multiplicities and also to make explicit calculations of nonlinear cohomology relations
which are known to be exist [11] for classical and exceptional Lie algebras.

(IV.1)

(IV.3)

(IV.4)

(IV.6)

In view of the fact that µ(1) ≡ 0, one can formally decompose (III.11) in the form

7

chs(Λ+, N ) ≡ X
s/k

cofs1s2..sk (Λ+, N ) µ(s1)µ(s2)..µ(sk)

(V.1)

and this allows us to deﬁne a number of polinomials

Ps1s2..sk (Λ+, N ) ≡

cofs1s2..sk (Λ+, N )
cofs1s2..sk (λk, N )

dimR(λk, N )
dimR(Λ+, N )

Ps1s2..sk (λk, N ) .

(V.2)

Note here that

and also

cofs1s2..sk (λi, N ) ≡ 0 ,

i < k

dimR(λi, N ) = M (N + 1, i)

,

i = 1, 2, ..N.

.

To proceed further, we will work on the explicit example of 4th order for which (V.1) and (V.2) give

ch4(Λ+, N ) ≡ cof4(Λ+, N ) µ(4) + cof22(Λ+, N ) µ(2)2 ,

P4(Λ+, N ) ≡

cof4(Λ+, N )
cof4(λ1, N )

dimR(λ1, N )
dimR(Λ+, N )

P4(λ1, N ) ,

P22(Λ+, N ) ≡

cof22(Λ+, N )
cof22(λ2, N )

dimR(λ2, N )
dimR(Λ+, N )

P22(λ2, N )

N dependences are explicitly written above. The main observation here is to change the variables ri of (II.1):

and to suggest the decompositions

1 + ri ≡ θi − θi+1

P4(Λ+, N ) =k1(4, N ) Θ(4, Λ+, N ) +
k2(4, N ) Θ(2, Λ+, N )2 +
k3(4, N ) Θ(3, Λ+, N ) +
k4(4, N ) Θ(2, Λ+, N ) +
k5(4, N )

P22(Λ+, N ) =k1(2, 2, N ) Θ(4, Λ+, N ) +
k2(2, 2, N ) Θ(2, Λ+, N )2 +
k3(2, 2, N ) Θ(3, Λ+, N ) +
k4(2, 2, N ) Θ(2, Λ+, N ) +
k5(2, 2, N )

.

Θ(s, Λ+, N ) ≡

(θi)s

.

N +1

X
i=1

As in (III.2) or (III.10), we also deﬁne here the generators

It is seen then that (V.9) and (V.10) are the most general forms compatible with Θ(1, Λ+, N ) ≡ 0. What is
signiﬁcant here is the possibility to solve equations (V.6) and (V.7) in view of assumptions (V.9) and (V.10)

(V.3)

(V.4)

(V.5)

(V.6)

(V.7)

(V.8)

(V.9)

(V.10)

(V.11)

and

and

but with coeﬃcients kα(4, N ), kα(2, 2, N ) which are independent of Λ+ for α = 1, .., 5. By examining for
a few simple representations, one can easily obtain the following non-zero solutions for these coeﬃcients:

8

k1(4, N ) =

(N 2 + 2N + 2) k5(4, N )

720
g4(N )

k2(4, N ) = −

720
g4(N ) (N + 1)

(2 N 2 + 4 N − 1) k5(4, N )

and

where

k1(2, 2, N ) = −

(2 N 2 + 4 N − 1) k5(2, 2, N )

k2(2, 2, N ) =

(N 4 + 4 N 3 − 8 N + 13) k5(2, 2, N )

(V.15)

k4(2, 2, N ) = −

(N − 2) (N − 1) (N + 1)2 (N + 3) (N + 4) k5(2, 2, N )

1440
g22(N )
720
g22(N ) (N + 1)

120
g22(N )

g4(N ) ≡

(N + i)

4

Y
i=−2

g22(N ) ≡ g4(N ) (5 N 2 + 10 N + 11) .

The calculations goes just in the same way for orders 5,6 and 7 and hence we directly give our solutions

in appendix.2.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In (I), we have obtained the most general formal operators representing 4th and also 5th order Casimir
invariants of AN Lie algebras. By comparing with the ones appearing in litterature, they are the most
general in the sense that both are to be expressed in terms of two free parameters. As is shown in (I), all
coeﬃcient polinomials of 4th order Casimir operators are expressed in terms of u(1) and u(2) for 4th order
Casimirs and those of 5th order Casimirs are v(1) and v(2). As is also emphasized there, the existence of two
free parameters for both cases can be thought of as related with the partitions 4=2+2 and 5=3+2. Recall
here the polinomials P4 and P22. This gives us the possibility to calculate the trace forms (I.1) directly in
any matrix representation of AN Lie algebras. These trace calculations are straigtforward and show that
eigenvalues of 4th order Casimir operators have the form of an explicit polinomial which depends on the
rank N and two free parameters u(1) and u(2). It is thus seen that there are always appropriate choices of
parameters u(1) and u(2) in such a way that this same polinomial reproduces P4(Λ+, N ) or P22(Λ+, N ) as
given in (V.9) and (V.10). The same is also true for 5th order Casimirs. With the appropriate choice

in (V.9) it is suﬃcient to take

Now it is clear that, this would be a direct evidence for equivalence between the formal expressions
(I.1) and (I.2). In result, it is seen that one can obtain κ(s) number of diﬀerent polinomials Ps1,s2,..sk (Λ+, N )
representing eigenvalues of AN Casimir operators I(s) of order s, with κ(s) is the number of partitions of s
to all positive integers except 1. As is known from (I), this is just the number of free parameters to describe
the most general form of I(s).

In this work, we consider the calculation of eigenvalues for AN Casimir operators of orders s=4,5,6,7.
It is however apparent that all our results are to be accomplished as in exactly the same way and with the
same ability for all orders. The following applications of the formula (III.7) will be instructive for all other
cases of interest:

Ω4(q1, N ) =

1
(N + 1 − 1)!

On the other hand, for an eﬀective application of (III.7), it is clear that one needs to reduce the generators
q(s1, s2, ..sk) in terms of q(s)’s. Following ones are suﬃcient within the scope of this work. Together with
the condition that µ(1) ≡ 0, the similars are valid also for µ(s1, s2, ..sk)’s:

q(4, 1) = q(1) q(4) − q(5)
q(3, 2) = q(2) q(3) − q(5)

Abstract

A thorough analysis of the stability of the uncoupled Rooth inter-

hemispheric 3-box model of thermohaline circulation (THC) is pre-

sented. The model consists of a northern high latitudes box, a tropical

box, and a southern high latitudes box, which respectively correspond

to the northern, tropical and southern Atlantic ocean. We adopt restor-

ing boundary conditions for the temperature variables and ﬂux bound-

ary conditions for the salinity variables. We study how the strength

of THC changes when the system undergoes forcings that are analo-

gous to those of global warming conditions by applying to the equilib-

rium state perturbations to the moisture and heat ﬂuxes into the three

boxes. In each class of experiments, we determine, using suitably de-

ﬁned metrics, the boundary dividing the set of forcing scenarios that

lead the system to equilibria characterized by a THC pattern similar

to the present one, from those that drive the system to equilibria with

a reversed THC. Fast increases in the moisture ﬂux into the northern

high-latitude box are more effective than slow increases in leading

the THC to a breakdown, while the increases of moisture ﬂux into the

southern high-latitude box strongly inhibits the breakdown and can

prevent it, in the case of slow increases in the Northern Hemisphere.

High rates of heat ﬂux increase in the North Hemisphere destabilize

the system more effectively than low ones, and increases in the heat

ﬂuxes in the Southern Hemisphere tend to stabilize the system.

1. Introduction

Following the classical picture of Sandstr¨om’s, the ocean circulation can be di-

vided, albeit somewhat ambiguously, into the wind-driven circulation, which is

directly induced by the mechanical action of the wind and essentially affects the

surface waters, and the thermohaline (THC) circulation, which is characterized

by relatively robust gradients in the buoyancy of the water masses (Weaver and

Hughes 1992; Rahmstorf 2000, 2002; Stocker et al. 2001). Although some stud-

ies show that the THC is very sensitive to wind stresses (Toggweiler and Samuels

1995), more recent studies suggest that the buoyancy forces are dominant when

more realistic boundary conditions are considered (Rahmstorf and England 1997;

Bugnion and Hill 2003). The THC dominates the large scale picture of the global

ocean circulation and is especially relevant for the intermediate-to-deep water.

One of the main issues in the study of climate change is the fate of the THC in

the context of global warming (Weaver and Hughes 1992; Manabe and Stouffer

1993; Stocker and Schmittner 1997; Rahmstorf 1997, 1999b,a, 2000; Wang et al.

1999a,b). The THC plays a major role in the global circulation of the oceans as

pictured by the conveyor belt scheme (Weaver and Hughes 1992; Stocker 2001);

therefore the effect on the climate of a change of its pattern may be global (Broecker

1997; Manabe and Stouffer 1999b; Cubasch et al. 2001; Seager et al. 2002). The

THC is sensitive to changes in the climate since the North Atlantic deep water

(NADW) formation is sensitive to variations in air temperature and in precipi-

tation in the Atlantic basin (Rahmstorf and Willebrand 1995; Rahmstorf 1996).

3

There are several paleoclimatic data sets indicating that changes in the patterns or

collapses of the THC coincide with large variations in climate, especially in the

North Atlantic region (Broecker et al. 1985; Boyle and Keigwin 1987; Keigwin

et al. 19994; Rahmstorf 2002).

Box models have historically played a major role in the understanding of the

fundamental dynamics of the THC (Weaver and Hughes 1992). The Stommel two-

box oceanic model (Stommel 1961) parameterized the THC strength as propor-

tional to the density gradient between the northern latitude and equatorial boxes.

The oceanic model proposed by Rooth (1982) introduced the idea that the driver

of the THC was density difference between the high latitude basins of the north-

ern and southern hemispheres, thus implying that the THC is an inter-hemispheric

phenomenon. Both the Stommel and Rooth models allow two stable equilibria,

one - the warm mode - characterized by downwelling of water in the high lati-

tudes of the North Atlantic, which resembles the present oceanic circulation, and

the other - the cold mode - characterized by upwelling of water in the high lati-

tudes of the North Atlantic. Perturbations to the driving parameters of the system,

i.e. freshwater and heat ﬂuxes in the oceanic boxes, can cause transitions between

the two regimes.

Various GCM experiments have shown that multiple equilibria of the THC are

possible (Bryan 1986; Manabe and Stouffer 1988; Stouffer et al. 1991; Stocker

and Wright 1991; Manabe and Stouffer 1999a; Marotzke and Willebrand 1991;

Hughes and Weaver 1994), and most GCMs have shown that the GHGs radiative

forcing could cause a weakening of the THC by the inhibition of the sinking of the

4

water in the Northern Atlantic. Large increases of the moisture ﬂux and/or of the

surface air temperature in the downwelling regions are the driving mechanisms of

such a process. Nevertheless in a recent global warming simulation run the THC

remained almost constant since the destabilizing mechanisms have been offset

by the increase of the salinity advected into the downwelling region due to net

freshwater export from the whole North Atlantic (Latif et al. 2000).

Hemispheric box models along the lines of Stommel’s have been extensively

studied and the stability of their THC has been assessed in the context of various

levels of complexity in the representation of the coupling between the ocean and

the atmosphere (Weaver and Hughes 1992; Nakamura et al. 1994; Marotzke 1996;

Krasovskiy and Stone 1998; Tziperman and Gildor 2002).

However, analysis of GCM data have indicated that the THC is an inter-

hemispheric phenomenon, and in some cases it has been found that the THC

strength is approximatively proportional to the density difference between the

Northern and Southern Atlantic (Hughes and Weaver 1994; Rahmstorf 1996; Klinger

and Marotzke 1999; Wang et al. 1999a), thus supporting Rooth’s approach.

In this paper we perform an analysis of the stability of the present pattern of

the THC against changes to the heat and freshwater atmospheric ﬂuxes using an

uncoupled version of the Rooth oceanic model. We note that this model assumes

that buoyancy is well mixed in the vertical, and thus avoids the need for param-

eterizing the mixing (Munk and Wunsch 1998). The model here considered has

no real explicit coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere: the atmospheric

freshwater ﬂuxes are prescribed and the atmospheric heat ﬂuxes relax the oceanic

5

temperatures towards prescribed values (Rahmstorf 1996; Scott et al. 1999; Stone

and Krasovskiy 1999; Titz et al. 2002b,a).

We explicitly analyze what is the role of the spatial patterns and of the rates

of increase of the forcings in determining the response of the system. We con-

sider a suitably deﬁned metric and determine which are the thresholds beyond

which we have destabilization of the warm mode of the THC. We underline that

our treatment goes beyond quasi-static analysis since the effect of the rate of forc-

ing is explicitly addressed, so that we analyze how the effects on the system of

slow (Wang et al. 1999a) and rapid (Wiebe and Weaver 1999) changes join on; in

particular in the limit of very slow changes, our results coincide with those that

could be obtained with the analysis of the bifurcations of the system (Stone and

Krasovskiy 1999; Scott et al. 1999). Relatively few studies with more complex

models have explicitly addressed how the spatial (Rahmstorf 1995, 1996, 1997)

or temporal (Stocker and Schmittner 1997) patterns of forcing determine the re-

sponse of the system. However, these studies did not carry out a parametric study

of the inﬂuence of both spatial and temporal patterns. We emphasize that our

study is based on a process model which aims at obtaining a qualitative picture of

the properties of the THC more than providing quantitative results.

Our paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we provide a description and

the general mathematical formulation of the dynamics of the three-box model

used in this study. In section 3 we describe the parameterization of the physical

processes. In section 4 we analyze the feedbacks of the system. In section 5 we

describe the stability properties of the system when it is forced with perturbations

6

in the freshwater ﬂux.

In section 6 we describe the stability properties of the

system when it is forced with perturbations in the heat ﬂux.

In section 7 we

present our conclusions.

2. Model description

The three-box model consists of a northern high latitude box (box 1), a tropical

box (box 2), and a southern high latitude box (box 3). The volume of the two

high latitudes boxes is the same, and is 1/V times the volume of the tropical box.

We choose V = 2, so that box 1, box 2 and box 3 respectively can be thought

as describing the portions of an ocean like the Atlantic north of 30◦N , between

30◦N and 30◦S, and south of 30◦S. At the eastern and western boundaries of the

oceanic boxes there is land; our oceanic system spans 60◦ in longitude, so that it

covers ǫ = 1/6 of the total surface of the planet. The boxes are 5000 m deep, so

that the total mass Mi=1,3 = M of the water contained in each of the high-latitude

boxes is ≈ 1.1 · 1020 Kg, while M2 = V · Mi=1,3 = 2 · M . The tropical box is

connected to both high latitude boxes; moreover the two high latitude boxes are

connected by a deep current passage (which bypasses the tropical box) containing

a negligible mass. The three boxes are assumed to be well-mixed. The assumption

of well-mixed boxes excludes the polar halocline disaster (Bryan 1986; Weaver

and Hughes 1992; Zhang et al. 1993) from the range of phenomena that can be

described by this model. In our model we have not included a deep box as done in

Rahmstorf (1996). This choice allows an easier and more detailed control of the

7

behavior of the system, but implies that distortions are introduced in the response

of the system to fast perturbations (Weaver and Hughes 1992). The physical state

of the box i is described by its temperature Ti and its salinity Si; the box i receives

from the atmosphere the net ﬂux of heat ˜Hi and the net ﬂux of freshwater ˜Fi;

the freshwater ﬂuxes ˜Fi globally sum up to 0, since the freshwater is a globally

conserved quantity. The box i is subjected to the oceanic advection of heat and

salt from the upstream box through the THC, whose strength is ˜q.

In ﬁgure 1 we present a scheme of our system in the northern sinking pat-

tern: note that the arrows representative of the freshwater ﬂuxes are arranged in

such a way that the conservation law is automatically included in the graph. The

dynamics of the system is described by the tendency equations for the heat and

the salinity of each box. We divide the three heat tendency equations by cp · Mi,

where cp is the constant pressure speciﬁc heat of water per unit of mass, and in the

salinity tendency equations we neglect the contribution of the freshwater ﬂuxes in

the mass balance, so that virtual salinity ﬂuxes and freshwater ﬂuxes are equiva-

lent (Marotzke 1996; Rahmstorf 1996; Scott et al. 1999). We obtain the following

ﬁnal form for the temperature and salinity tendency equations for the three boxes

(Scott et al. 1999):

˙S1 + V ˙S2 + ˙S3=0, which implies that:

This conservation law holds at every time, and so rules out the possibility of in-

cluding in our study the effects of the melting of continental ice sheets. We note

that the system can (asymptotically) reach an equilibrium only if its feedbacks can

drive it towards a state in which the following equation holds:

H2 = −

(H1 + H3).

The strength of the speciﬁc THC is parameterized as proportional to the dif-

ference between the density of the water contained in the box 1 and the density

of the water contained in the box 3, as in the Rooth (1982) model. Given that the

water density can approximately be expressed as:

ρ(T, S) ≈ ρ0(1 − αT + βS);

(9)

where α and β are respectively the thermal and haline expansion coefﬁcients, set

respectively to 1.5 · 10−4 ◦C −1 and 8 · 10−4 psu−1, and ρ0 is a standard reference

density, we obtain for the normalized THC strength q the following relation:

q =

(ρ1 − ρ3) = k [α (T3 − T1) + β (S1 − S3)] ,

(10)

k
ρ0

where k is the hydraulic constant, chosen to obtain a reasonable value of the THC

strength. We emphasize that the constant k roughly summarizes the wind-powered

turbulent mixing taking place in the ocean and powering the THC, and we think

that in principle it should be expressed as a function of the climatic state of the

10

system rather than being a constant.

The northern (southern) sinking state of the circulation is therefore character-

ized by q > (<)0. Considering the case q > 0, we obtain a diagnostic relation for

steady state q by setting to 0 equations (3) and (6), and using equation (9):

qeq = [k (αH eq

3 + βF eq

3 )]

1/2

;

(11)

in the case q < 0, a diagnostic relation for the steady state q can be obtained using

the same procedure as above but setting to zero equations (1) and (4):

qeq = − [k (αH eq

1 + βF eq

1 )]

1/2

.

(12)

We conclude that the equilibrium value of the THC strength is determined by the

equilibrium values of the heat and freshwater ﬂuxes of the box where we have

upwelling of water. These results generalize the expressions given in (Rahmstorf

1996). The transient evolution of q is determined by its tendency equation:

˙q = −q2 + kq [α (T1 − T2) − β (S1 − S2)] +

+k [α (H3 − H1) + β (F3 − F1)]

,

q ≥ 0,

˙q = q2 + kq [α (T3 − T2) − β (S3 − S2)] +

+k [α (H1 − H3) + β (F1 − F3)]

,

q < 0,

We observe that the difference between the forcings applied to the freshwater

11

(13)

(14)

and heat ﬂuxes into the two boxes 1 and 3 directly effect the evolution of q; the

presence of terms involving the gradient of temperature and salinity between box

2 and box 1 (box 3) if q > 0 (q < 0) breaks the symmetry of the role played by

the two high latitude boxes. In our experiments we perturb an initial equilibrium

state by changing at various rates the parameters controlling the ﬂuxes Hi and/or

Fi and observe under which conditions we obtain a reversal of the THC. The

reversal of the THC causes a sudden cooling and freshening in the box 1 and

a sudden warming and increase of the salinity in the box 3, because the former

loses and the latter receives the advection of the tropical warm and salty water.

3. Parameterization of the physical processes

We perform our study considering the original formulation of the Rooth (1982)

model and thus consider mixed boundary conditions for the surface ﬂuxes. For a

more detailed description of the model see also the paper by Scott et al. (1999).

The heat ﬂux into the box i is described by a newtonian relaxation law of the

form Hi = λi(τ i − Ti) where the parameter τ i is the target temperature (Brether-

ton 1982), which represents a climatologically reasonable value towards which

the box temperature is relaxed, and the parameter λi quantiﬁes the efﬁcacy of the

relaxation. Along the lines of the paper of Scott et al. (1999) and following the

parameterization introduced by Marotzke (1996), we choose τ 1 = τ 3 = 0◦C and

τ 2 = 30◦ C, and select λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = λ = 1.29 · 10−9 s−1, which mimics the

combined effect of radiative heat transfer and of a meridional heat transport pa-

12

rameterized as being linearly proportional to the meridional temperature gradient

(Marotzke and Stone 1995; Marotzke 1996; Scott et al. 1999). In physical terms,

λ corresponds to a restoring coefﬁcient of ≈ 4.3 W m−2 ◦C −1 affecting the whole

planetary surface, which translates into an effective ˜λ ≈ 1/ǫ · 4.3 W m−2 ◦C −1 =

25.8 W m−2 ◦C −1 relative to the oceanic surface fraction only.

Using equations (1-3), we can obtain the following tendency equation for the

globally averaged temperature TM = (T1 + V T2 + T3)/(2 + V ):

˙TM = λ(τ M − TM )

(15)

where τ M is the average target temperature; the average temperature relaxes to-

wards its target value in about 25 y, which is very close to the value considered by

Titz et al. (2002b); we observe that in the case of an ocean with vertical resolution,

our heat ﬂux parameterization corresponds to a restoring time of ≈ 3 months for

a 50 m deep surface level (Marotzke and Stone 1995).

The virtual salinity ﬂuxes Fi are not functions of any of the state variables

of the system, and are given parameters. We choose F1 = 13.5 · 10−11 psu s−1

and F3 = 9 · 10−11 psu s−1, which respectively correspond to net atmospheric

freshwater ﬂuxes of ≈ 0.40 Sv into the box 1 and of ≈ 0.27 Sv into the box 3.

These values are based on the analysis of the hydrology of the two hemispheres

presented by Baumgartner and Reichel (1975) and by Peixoto and Oort (1992).

Our model neglects moisture ﬂuxes associated with the wind-driven circulation.

If these were strong enough to reverse the sign of F3, the model’s behavior would

13

be very different (Rahmstorf 1996; Titz et al. 2002b), but would not be in accord

with observations.

Choosing k = 1.5·10−6 s−1, at equilibrium we have q ≈ 1.47·10−10 s−1 (Scott

et al. 1999). In physical terms this value describes a THC in the northern sinking

pattern with a strength of ≈ 15.5 Sv:

this value agrees reasonably well with

estimates coming from observations (Roemmich and Wunsch 1985; Macdonald

and Wunsch 1996). We emphasize that this THC strength introduces an oceanic

time scale ts ≈ 250y, which is the ratio between the box 1 and 3 volumes and

the equilibrium state water transport. We refer to this time scale as the ﬂushing or

advective time of the ocean since it is the time it takes for the ocean circulation to

empty out box 1 or box 3 as well as to propagate the information from one box to

another. We underline that, since we have considered the approximation of well-

mixed boxes, our model should not be considered very reliable for phenomena

taking place in time scales ≪ ts.

In this equilibrium state boxes 1 and 3 receive a net poleward oceanic heat

advection of ≈ 1.58 P W , and ≈ 0.17 P W respectively. The former agrees rea-

sonably well with estimates. The latter agrees with the sign of the global transport

in the Southern Hemisphere, but disagrees with the sign in just the Southern At-

lantic (Peixoto and Oort 1992; Macdonald and Wunsch 1996). The equilibrium

temperature of box 1 is larger than the equilibrium temperature of box 3, and the

same inequality holds for the salinities, the main reason being that box 1 receives

directly the warm and salty tropical water. Taking into account equation (9) and

considering that the actual equilibrium q is positive, we conclude that the THC is

14

haline-dominated: the ratio between the absolute value of the thermal and of the

haline contribution on the right side of equation 9 is ≈ 0.8. The occurrence of

the haline dominated mode depends of course on the forcing parameters, which

we have based on observations. The haline mode, with its positive value for q, is

consistent with observations. We report in table 1 the values of the main model

constants, while in table 2 we present the fundamental parameters characterizing

this equilibrium state.

4. Feedbacks of the system

The newtonian relaxation law for the temperature implies that the atmosphere has

a negative thermic feedback:

• Ti increases ⇒ Hi decreases ⇒ Ti decreases

The reaction of the ocean to a decrease in the strength of the THC can be described

as follows:

• q decreases ⇒

1. T1 decreases more than T3 ⇒

(a) q increases

(b) the change is limited by the atmospheric feedback;

2. S1 decreases more than S3 ⇒ q decreases;

15

The heat advection feedback (1) is negative and dominates the positive salinity

advection feedback (2). We underline that the sign of the salinity feedback de-

pends on the asymmetry in the freshwater ﬂuxes Scott et al. (1999). We note

that the strength of the second order feedback mechanism (1b) is relevant in es-

tablishing the overall stability of the THC (Tziperman et al. 1994); a very strong

temperature-restoring atmospheric feedback like that in our model tends to de-

crease the stability of the system (Nakamura et al. 1994; Rahmstorf 2000). The

feedbacks (1) + (2) are governed by q, so that their time scale is around the ﬂush-

ing time ts ≈ 250 y (Scott et al. 1999) of the oceanic boxes. We expect that a

fast perturbation avoids those feedbacks, since it bypasses the ocean-controlled

transfer of information needed to activate them.

In order to simulate global warming conditions, we perform two sets of exper-

iments. In the ﬁrst, we increase the freshwater ﬂuxes into the two high-latitude

boxes. The rationale for this forcing is in the fact that an increase in the global

mean temperature produces an increase in the moisture capacity of the atmo-

sphere, and this is likely to cause the enhancement of the hydrological cycle, and

especially in the transport of moisture from the tropics to the high latitudes. In

the second, we represent the purely thermic effects of global warming by setting

the increase in the target temperatures of the two high-latitude boxes larger than

that of the tropical boxes, since virtually all GCM simulations forecast a larger

increase in temperatures in the high latitudes (the so-called polar ampliﬁcation).

16

5. Freshwater ﬂux forcing

We force the previously deﬁned equilibrium state with a net freshwater ﬂux into

the two high latitudes boxes which increases linearly with time; this is obtained

by prescribing:

Fi(t) =

Fi(0) + F t

i · t, 0 ≤ t ≤ t0

i = 1, 3

Fi(0) + F t

i · t0

t > t0

i = 1, 3






(16)

We impose the conservation of the globally averaged salinity of the oceanic sys-

tem by requiring that equation (7) hold at all times. When the perturbation is over,

we reach a ﬁnal state that can be either qualitatively similar to the initial north-

ern sinking equilibrium or radically different, i.e. presenting a reversed THC.

Each perturbation can be uniquely speciﬁed by a set of three parameters, such

as the triplet 1 [t0, ∆F3/∆F1, ∆F1], or the triplet 2 [t0, ∆F3/∆F1, F t

1], where

∆Fi ≡ F t

i · t0 is the total change of the freshwater ﬂux into box i. In order to

describe a global warming scenario, we explore the effect of positive ∆F1 and

∆F3. Freshwater forcing into box 1 tends to destabilize the THC, since it in-

duces a freshening and so a decrease of the density of the water. If the freshwater

forcing is larger in the box 3, we do not obtain a reversal of the THC, the main

reason being that increases in the net freshwater ﬂux into box 3 tend to stabilize

the circulation, as can be seen in equation (11). Since we are interested in the

destabilizing perturbations, we limit ourselves to the case ∆F3/∆F1 < 1. These

perturbations cause an initial decrease in the THC strength q and so trigger the

17

following feedbacks:

• F1’s increase larger than F3’s ⇒ S1 decreases more than S3 ⇒ q decreases.

We present in ﬁgure 2 two trajectories of q describing the evolution of the system

from the initial equilibrium state when two different forcings, one subcritical and

one supercritical, are applied. The oscillations in the value of q, which are slowly

decaying in the subcritical case, are caused by the action of the heat and salinity

advection feedbacks, which act on time scales of the order of the ﬂushing time of

the oceanic boxes (ts ≈ 250 years). In the case of the supercritical perturbation the

oscillations of the value of q grow in size until the system collapses to a southern

sinking equilibrium. The two trajectories separate ≈ 400 years after the beginning

of the perturbation, when the negative feedback due to the decrease of advection of

warm, salty water in box 1 becomes of critical relevance. The threshold value for

q is of the order of 10 Sv: more complex models have shown that weak THC are

not stable (Rahmstorf 1995; Tziperman 2000). When the THC does not change

sign, it recovers to its initial unperturbed value (if ∆F3 = 0) or overshoots it

(∆F3 > 0), as can be deduced from 11; this reminds us of results obtained with

much more complex models (Wiebe and Weaver 1999).

a. Hysteresis

The hysteresis describes the response of the THC against quasi-static freshwater

ﬂux perturbations, i.e., with a very large t0, in both boxes 1 and 3. In ﬁgure 3

we have plotted 4 curves, corresponding to ∆F3/∆F1 = [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]. The

18

obtained graphs essentially represent the stationary states for given values of the

freshwater ﬂux. For a given curve, each point (x, y) plotted represents a stable

state of the system having q = y and F1 = x. We scale all the graphs so that

the common initial equilibrium state is the point (1, 1). For a range of F1, which

depends on the value of ∆F3/∆F1, the system is bistable, i.e. it possesses two

distinct stable states, one having q > 0, the other one having q < 0. The history of

the system determines which of the two stable states is realized. The boundaries

of the domain in F1 where the system is bistable correspond to subcritical Hopf bi-

furcations (Scott et al. 1999), which drive the system from the northern (southern)

sinking equilibrium to the southern (northern) sinking equilibrium if F1 crosses

the right (left) boundary of the domain of bistability. If ∆F3/∆F1 is large enough

slow increases of the freshwater ﬂuxes do not destabilize the system, so that no

bifurcations are present. It is interesting to note that if F3 is kept constant, the

value of q doe not depend on the value of F1 in the northern sinking branch, while

clearly the dependence is apparent in the southern sinking branch. This can be ex-

plained by considering that at equilibrium the value of q is mainly determined by

the value of the freshwater ﬂux into the upwelling box, as shown in equation (11).

We remark that since these hysteresis experiments involve simultaneous perturba-

tions to the moisture ﬂuxes in both hemispheres, they differ from those presented

in Rahmstorf (1996), where the perturbations to the moisture ﬂuxes occurred in

one high-latitude box.

Albeit with differences in the experimental settings in some cases, the pres-

ence of an hysteresis for slow freshwater ﬂux perturbations has been previsouly

19

presented both for simple (Rahmstorf 1996; Scott et al. 1999; Titz et al. 2002b) as

well as more complex interhemispheric models (Stocker and Wright 1991; Miko-

lajewicz and Maier-Reimer 1994; Rahmstorf 1995, 1996), while the inclusion of

changes in the freshwater ﬂux into both high latitude boxes as presented here had

not been previously considered.

b. Critical Forcings

Figures 4a) and 4b) present, using respectively the coordinates described by the

triplets 1 and 2, the contours of the height of the manifold dividing the subcritical

from the supercritical forcings. We consider logarithmic scales instead of linear

scales since the former allow to capture more clearly the qualitative behavior of

the system. In ﬁgure 4a) we observe that, as expected the lower is the value of the

ratio ∆F3/∆F1, the lower is the total change ∆F1 needed to obtain the reversal

of the THC. For a given value of the ratio ∆F3/∆F1, more rapidly increasing per-

turbations (larger F t

1) are more effective in disrupting the circulation. For values

of ∆F3/∆F1 ≤ 0.4 we see a changeover between a slow and a fast regime, ge-

ometrically described by a relatively high- gradient region dividing two portions

of the manifold having little x−dependence. Figure 4b) shows more clearly that

for large values of ∆F3/∆F1 (≥ 0.5) the collapse of the THC occurs only for

fast increases, because of the presence of a threshold in the rate of increase de-

picted by the little t0−dependence of the manifold. The changeover corresponds

to t0 ≈ ts, which essentially matches the ﬂushing time of the oceanic boxes (Scott

20

et al. 1999). For low values of ∆F3/∆F1 the disruption of the initial THC pat-

tern takes place even in the case of a very low F t

1, as essentially captured in the

hysteresis study of the previous subsection. This occurs because, as shown in the

analysis performed by Scott et al. (1999), there is a critical ratio F3/F1 below

which the northern sinking equilibrium becomes unstable. Such a ratio can be

reached after a long enough t0 if the slow perturbation is characterized by a low

enough value of ∆F3/∆F1.

c. Relevance of the mixed boundary conditions

In order to explore the relevance of the mixed BCs for the stability of the THC

pattern against freshwater ﬂux perturbations (Tziperman et al. 1994; Nakamura

et al. 1994), we have considered also a second version of the model where we

replace the expression of the heat ﬂux in the box i deﬁned as λ(τ i − Ti) with

a free parameter Hi, thus realizing a ﬂux BC model. Choosing the value of the

initial Hi equal to the value of λ(τ i − Ti) of the previous version of the model

at equilibrium, we obtain the same equilibrium solution. We then perturb this

equilibrium solution with freshwater ﬂux forcing as in the previous case. Since

the heat ﬂux Hi does not depend on Ti, the positive feedback (1b) described at

the beginning of the section is off, therefore we expect this version of the system

to be more stable than the previous one. Repeating the analysis of stability to

freshwater ﬂux perturbations for the ﬂux BC model, it is indeed conﬁrmed that

temperature restoring conditions decrease the stability of the model, in agreement

21

with the results of Tziperman et al. (1994), Nakamura et al. (1994), and Rahmstorf

(2000).

Comparing the hysteresis graphs obtained for the mixed and ﬂux BCs sys-

tems presented in ﬁgure 5, it is apparent that the mixed BCs model is less stable

with respect to freshwater ﬂux perturbations. Excluding the temperature feedback

mechanism, we do not obtain collapses of the THC for quasi-static perturbations

for ∆F3/∆F1 = 0.3, while for each of the cases ∆F3/∆F1 = [0, 0.1, 0.2] the bi-

furcation point is much farther than in the mixed BC model from the point (1, 1),

which describes the unperturbed system.

Figure 6 shows the ratio between the values of the critical values of ∆F1 pre-

sented in ﬁgure 4 and the corresponding values obtained with the ﬂux BC model.

The average value of this ratio over all the domain is ≈ 0.3. Observing ﬁgure

6 for ∆F3/∆F1 = [0.3, 0.4], we see that the ratio goes to 0 with increasing t0

because in this subdomain for slow forcings we have destabilization for ﬁnite val-

ues of ∆F1 only in the mixed BCs case. This occurs because for these values the

threshold in the rate of increase is present only in the ﬂux BC model, therefore in

this model for large t0 the quantity ∆F1 diverges, while in the mixed BC model it

is ﬁnite.

6. Thermal forcing

We explore the stability of the northern sinking equilibrium against perturbations

to the initial heat ﬂuxes expressed as changes in the target temperatures in the

22

three boxes. We do not impose a constraint ﬁxing the average target temperature

τ M , so that in this case not two but three parameters τ 1, τ 2, τ 3 can be changed.

It is possible to recast the system of equations (1-6) (Scott et al. 1999) so that

the heat forcing is described completely by the changes in τ N = τ 1 − τ 2 and in

τ S = τ 3 − τ 2. Therefore, we set τ 2 = τ 2(0) at all times, so that τ t

1 = τ t

N and

3 = τ t
τ t

S. We apply the following forcings:

τ i(t) =

τ i(0) + τ t

i · t, 0 ≤ t ≤ t0

i = 1, 3

τ i(0) + τ t

i · t0

t > t0

i = 1, 3






(17)

We characterize each forcing experiment, which leads to a ﬁnal state that is char-

acterized by a northern or a southern sinking equilibrium, using the parameter set

1 deﬁned as [t0, ∆τ3/∆τ1, ∆τ1] and the parameter set 2 deﬁned as [t0, ∆τ3/∆τ1, τ t

1];

consistently with the previous case we deﬁne ∆τi ≡ τ t

i · t0, that is the total change

of the target temperature of the box i. In order to imitate global warming scenarios

where polar ampliﬁcation occurs, we consider ∆τi ≥ 0 , i = 1, 3. We observe

that if ∆τ3 > ∆τ1, no destabilization of the THC can occur, because such a forc-

ing reinforces the THC. The speciﬁed forcings trigger the previously described

feedbacks of the system in the following way:

• τ 1’s increase larger than τ 3’s ⇒ H1’s increase larger than H3’s ⇒ T1 in-

creases more than T3 ⇒ q decreases.

We present in ﬁgure 7 two trajectories of q starting from the initial equilibrium

state, characterized by slightly different choices of the forcing applied to τ 1 and

23

τ 3. One of the forcing is supercritical, the other one is subcritical. The two tra-

jectories are barely distinguishable up to the end of the perturbation, because the

forcing dominates the internal feedbacks of the system thanks to the large value

of λ. The oscillations in the value of q at the end of the perturbation are caused by

the internal feedbacks of the system and have a period comparable with the time

scale of the ﬂushing of the oceanic boxes. In general, the mean ﬂow dampens the

increase in T1 and tends to keep the system in the northern sinking state, although

the decreasing q lowers the amount of warm, salty tropical water injected into

box 1. When q gets too small (in this case about 4 Sv) the mean ﬂow feedback

becomes negligible and the system eventually collapses.

a. Hysteresis

We present in ﬁgure 8 only the graphs relative to ∆τ3/∆τ1 = [0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8] for

sake of simplicity; the other curves that can be obtained for other values of 0 ≤

∆τ3/∆τ1 < 1 are not qualitatively different. The initial state is the point (0, 1).

The subcritical Hopf bifurcation points are respectively (≈ 5, ≈ 0.7), (≈ 6, ≈

0.7)(≈ 9, ≈ 0.7), and (≈ 18, ≈ 0.6). This means that the bifurcation occurs when

the THC has already declined down to ≈ 10 Sv. The bistable region is extremely

large in all cases, because the x of the bifurcation points in the lower part of

the circuits are below −50◦C; they become farther and farther from the initial

equilibrium value as ∆τ3/∆τ1 increases. This means that once the circulation

has reversed, the newly established pattern is extremely stable and can hardly

24

be changed again. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time such an analysis of

hysteresis graphs for this class of forcing is presented in the literature.

b. Critical Forcings

Figure 9 presents the contours of the height of the manifold of the critical forcings.

We can observe that for all the values of ∆τ3/∆τ1 there is a high-gradient region

dividing two ﬂat regions describing the fast and slow regimes. In the fast region,

a smaller total increase ∆τ1 is required to achieve the reversal of the THC. For

∆τ3/∆τ1 = 0.9, which represents the case of highly symmetrical forcings, the

critical ∆τ1 essentially does not depend on t0. We underline that the time scale of

such a changeover is larger than ts ≈ 250 y, the main reason being that because of

the large value of λ, which is about one order of magnitude larger than the initial

q, the forcing is stronger than any negative feedback even if it is relatively slow.

For the same reason, in the case of perturbations to the target temperatures, we do

not observe the presence of thresholds for the rate of increase of the perturbations

as seen for freshwater forcings. If the increase in τ1 is slow enough, the negative

feedbacks make the destabilization more difﬁcult, but do not prevent it.

7. Conclusions

In this paper we have accomplished a thorough analysis of the stability of the

THC as described by the Rooth model. We simulate global warming conditions

by applying to the equilibrium state perturbations to the moisture and heat ﬂuxes

25

into the three boxes.

In particular the relevance of the role of changes in the

freshwater ﬂux into the Southern Ocean is determined, along the lines of Scott

et al. (1999) for a similar box model and Wang et al. (1999a) for an OGCM.

We have presented the hysteresis graphs for freshwater ﬂux perturbations that

reproduce and extend the results previously given in the literature, because the

effect of freshwater ﬂux increases in the Southern ocean are included, while for the

ﬁrst time hysteresis experiments for heat ﬂux forcings, obtained by perturbation

in the target temperature, are presented.

High rates of increase in the moisture ﬂux into the northern high-latitude box

lead to a THC breakdown at smaller ﬁnal increases than low rates, while the pres-

ence of moisture ﬂux increases into the southern high-latitude box strongly inhibit

the breakdown. Similarly, fast heat ﬂux increases in the North Hemisphere desta-

bilize the system more effectively than slow ones, and again the enhancement of

the heat ﬂuxes in the Southern Hemisphere tend to drive the system towards stabil-

ity. In all cases analyzed, slow forcings, if asymmetric enough, lead to the reversal

of the THC.

In our model the spatial pattern of forcing is critical in determining the re-

sponse of the system: quasi-symmetric forcings, which seem more reasonable un-

der realistic global warming conditions, are not very effective in destabilizing the

THC. The simplicity of the feedbacks characterizing our model, and in particular

the absence of stratiﬁcation effects, may be responsible for this behavior.

We have shown that the restoring boundary conditions for temperature de-

crease the stability of the system, because they introduce an additional positive

26

feedback that tends to destabilize the system. Flux boundary conditions provide

the system with much greater stability with respect to perturbations in the fresh-

water ﬂuxes at all time scales.

Our study is based on a conceptual model, therefore it aims at obtaining a qual-

itative picture of the properties of the THC more than providing realistic results.

Nevertheless, future increases in the computer power availability could allow the

adoption of this methodology for performing extensive parametric studies of the

THC stability properties and evolution with more complex and realistic models in

both paleoclimatic and global warming perspectives.

We conclude that the study of the THC response to perturbations performed

with uncoupled models, of any level of complexity, should take into much greater

account the spatial pattern of the freshwater and/or heat ﬂux forcing. The THC

is a highly nonlinear, nonsymmetric, system, and we suggest that the effect of

changing the rate of increase of the forcings should be explored in greater detail,

to provide a bridge between the instantaneous and quasi-static changes. The THC

dynamics encompasses very different time-scales, which can be explored only if

the timing of the forcings is varied.

We conclude by pointing out some possible improvements to the present model

and possible extensions of this work. We have put emphasis on how the oceanic

advection can reverse the symmetry of the pattern of the circulation in the context

of a rigorously symmetric geometry. The system is likely to be very sensitive to

changes in the volumes of the boxes and especially to the introduction of asym-

metries between the two high-latitude boxes, which would also make the system

27

more realistic since the southern mid-high latitude portion of the Atlantic is con-

siderably larger than the northern mid-high latitude portion (Zickfeld et al. 2003).

Asymmetries in the oceanic fractional areas would induce asymmetries in the val-

ues of λi, thus causing the presence of different restoring times for the various

boxes.

The introduction of a noise component in the tendency equation would in-

crease the model’s realism and make the model conceptually more satisfying since

it would introduce a parameterization of the high-frequency variability. Recent

studies have undertaken this strategy and shown that close to instability threshold

the evolution of the THC has a very limited predictability (Wang et al. 1999a;

Knutti and Stocker 2001), and that stochastic resonance could be responsible for

glacial/interglacial climate shifts (Ganopolski and Rahmstorf 2002). It would be

interesting to analyze how the intensity and the color of the noise would inﬂuence

the results obtained and the conclusions drawn in this work.

Finally, the model could be improved so that it could be able to represent

the main features of the whole conveyor belt, by adding other boxes, descrip-

tive of other oceanic basins, and carefully setting the connections between the

boxes, along the lines of some examples presented by Weaver and Hughes (1992).

Moreover, the consideration of a deep ocean box would surely increase the model

performance in terms of representation of the short time scales.

In an extension of this paper (Lucarini and Stone 2004) we perform a similarly

structured stability analysis of the THC under global warming conditions using a

more complex version of the Rooth model, where an explicit coupling between the

28

oceanic and the atmospheric part is introduced and the main atmospheric physical

processes responsible for freshwater and heat ﬂuxes are formulated separately.

Abstract    An  interpretation  of  the  twin  paradox  in  special  relativity  is  proposed.  Using  a  new 
paradox  in  which  acceleration  does  not  appear,  we  show  that  to  dissolve  the  paradox,  a  reference 
frame at rest is needed, and the frame in which time passes the fastest is defined as the inertial frame 
at rest. To prove the existence of the inertial frame at rest, we propose to check the periodic orbital 
reference  time  deviation  of  transversal  Doppler  shift  in  the  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS) 
satellites.

1. INTRODUCTION 

The relative theory has been used in our daily lives. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is used 
in a car navigation system. GPS and special relativity are summarized by Ashby [1]. GPS satellites 
orbit  in  a  small  gravitation  area  (~20,000  km  from  the  ground  level)  at  4  km/s.  Therefore,  the 
difference between the gravitational potentials on the ground and in the GPS satellites, and the effect 
of  special  relativity  on  the  motion  of  the  GPS  satellites,  which  is  a  transversal  Doppler  shift,  are 
considered [1]. The transversal Doppler shift, which is a second-order Doppler shift, is caused by the 
Lorentz transformation of time.   
    After the paper of Einstein [2] in 1905, relativity of motion was discussed frequently [3-5]. There 
were  indications  of  reconsideration  for  the  assumption  made  by  Einstein,  in  that  the  relativity 
between different frames should be discussed [4].   

In this study, we attempt to introduce an auxiliary line for simply illustrating special relativity. The 
auxiliary line is the reference frame at rest, in which motion is defined by absolute velocity. At this 
stage, the auxiliary line looks very realistic, so that we consider that the relative theory can be easily 
and  simply  understood  by  introducing  the  reference  frame  at  rest.  According  to  this  line,  the  twin 
paradox is discussed.     
    The twin paradox is one of the most famous paradoxes in special relativity. One of a pair of twins 
who  returns  from  a  space  trip  will  be  younger  than  the  other  one  on  earth.  However,  from  the 

 

1 

    Sato 

viewpoint of  relativity, the twin who has returned from  the space trip can claim that the other one 
who  stayed  on  earth  has  moved  away  from  the  space  ship.  Generally  to  resolve  this  paradox,  it  is 
said that the conditions experienced by the twins were different, he who experienced the space trip 
was  accelerated,  therefore  the  acceleration  made  the  difference.  A  quantitative  discussion  using 
numerical acceleration ratio shows that acceleration does not play a critical role in the paradox. For 
example, we need 200 days to obtain a speed of 60% of the light speed at a gravitational acceleration 
of ~10 m/s2; however, the effect of acceleration is estimated to be approximately 9 ms. The paradox 
does not show the association of the time delay with acceleration.       
    In  this  discussion,  numerical  acceleration  is  considered,  the  twin  paradox  is  represented  by 
moderate  acceleration.  If  the  space  ship  is  accelerated  by  an  acceleration  ratio  on  the  order  of 
gravitation,  acceleration  does  not  play  an  important  role;  thus,  acceleration  does  not  give  a 
reasonable  explanation  for  the  twin  paradox.  If  one  of  the  twins  accelerates  at  the  gravitational 
acceleration, the one who travels in space is younger. Acceleration is not the cause of the paradox.   
  To resolve the twin paradox, we should adopt the reference frame of motion. In 1905, Einstein [2] 
pointed out that we do not need the absolute space frame defined by ether; however, he did not state 
that  the  special  relativity  denies  the  absolute  space  frame.  In  1920  [6],  he  stated  that  the  special 
relativity does not deny ether, and declared that general relativity needs ether [6, 7]. We consider that 
special  relativity  is  compatible  with  the  absolute  space  frame,  in  that  Lorentz  invariance  does  not 
demand modification by adopting an absolute space frame. By this discussion, we refute Einstein’s 
hypothesis in 1905; however, the discussion is carried out on the basis of the special relative theory. 
Tremendous data concerning special relativity depend on Lorentz invariance; however, they do not 
confirm  or  deny  the  existence  of  the  absolute  space  frame.  Special  relativity  with  ether  can  be 
considered. 

We clarify the twin paradox. The paradox is caused when either twin insists that the other made 
relative motion, and only the one who made the space trip is younger. The paradox is caused by the 
second-order  Doppler  shift.  The  longitudinal  Doppler  shift  is  caused  by  the  effect  of  geometrical 
drawing  and  the  second-order  Doppler  shift.  The  effect  of  geometrical  drawing  means  that  the 
change of the detection of the wavefront number is induced by the distance change between the light 
source  and  the  detector. The  second-order Doppler  shift is  the  Lorentz  transformation  of  time.  We 
point  out  that  the  reason  for  the  misunderstanding  of  the  second-order  Doppler  shift  is  the 
philosophy that the reference frame at rest is not assumed. 

In  the  Doppler  shift,  when  the  observer  and  light  source  leave  each  other,  they  detect  the 
frequency decline of the other. There is a difference in frequency decline between acoustic wave and 
light.  In  light,  the  frequency  decline  is  seen  to  be  the  same  between  the  observer  and  the  source; 
however,  in  acoustic  wave,  it  is  not.  The  twin  paradox  arises  not  from  the  effect  of  geometrical 
drawing but from the second-order Doppler shift. The paradox should be discussed on the basis of 
the second-order Doppler shift. 

Finally, to prove the existence of the inertial frame at rest, we propose to check the periodic orbital 
reference time deviation in GPS satellites. The deviation is of the order of ~10-8. A periodic orbital 
deviation  that  critically  depends  on  the  motion  of  the  orbital  plane  of  the  GPS  satellites  in  space 
background radiation is detected.

2. TWIN PARADOX 
2.1 Assumption   

The  paradox  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  there  is  no  reference  frame  at  rest.  Acceleration 
induces the difference between the time gains on the earth and in the rocket; however, the time delay 
induced  by  an  acceleration  on  the  order  of  gravitational  acceleration  to  60  %  of  the  light  speed  is 
estimated to be 9 ms. Therefore, acceleration is not associated with paradox dissolution. 

We  make  the  assumption  of  our  discussion  clear  to  define  the  twin  paradox.  We  explain  the 
Doppler shift of the light source. If we see a moving rocket from the earth, the time delay of a clock 
in  the  rocket  is  detected.  This  is  known  as  the  frequency  Doppler  shift  of  the  light  source  and, 
depending on the relative velocity v, represented as

where  f’  is  the  Doppler  shift  of  frequency,  f0  is  the  frequency  of  the  light  source  on  the  reference 
frame at rest, and c is the light speed. According to the special relative theory, c is constant, that is, it 
is independent of velocity. Equation (1) shows the equation of the longitudinal Doppler shift, which 
consists  of  the  effects  of  geometrical  drawing  and  the  second-order  Doppler  shift.  The  effect  of 
geometrical drawing is the Doppler shift of an acoustic wave, as will be explained later. Equation (1) 
shows that the longitudinal Doppler shift frequency depends on the relative velocity v.   

The clock time in the rocket is delayed according to the second-order Doppler shift (i.e., Lorentz 

transformation), as shown in

where t1 is the reference time in the rocket and t0 is the reference time in the reference frame at rest. 
We assume t0 to be the reference time on earth, because the earth moves against space background 
radiation  at  the  velocity  of  380  km/s,  which  is  nearly  equal  to  0 compared  with  the  light  speed of 
300,000  km/s.  We  assume  the  earth  to  be  the  tentative  reference  frame  at  rest.  The  increase  in 
reference time t1 means that the reference time of one second becomes larger. This indicates that the 
time of clock delays, that is, the clock time, slows down.   

When we look at the rocket from the earth, the clock time in the rocket is delayed according to not 
only  geometrical  drawing  but  also  the  second-order  Doppler  shift.  These  two  effects  cause  a 
longitudinal  Doppler  shift.  When  we  look  at  the  earth  from  the  rocket,  the  clock  time  on  earth  is 
delayed according to the effect of geometrical drawing; however, the reference time t1 in the rocket 
increases, which makes the clock on earth, when seen from the rocket, appears to gain time. These 
two  effects  cause  the  longitudinal  Doppler  shift  to  be  the  same  between  the  earth  and  the  rocket. 
Equation (1) shows this fact clearly.   

Let  us  consider  the  Doppler  shift  of  an  acoustic  wave. This  transformation  is  obtained  from  the 

geometrical drawing and shown as

where v0 is the velocity of the observer, vS is the velocity of the sound source and cA is the sound 
velocity.  The  frequency  of  the  sound  source  fC  is  constant,  that  is,  it  is  not  independent  of  the 
velocity of the sound source. The effect of geometrical drawing means the change of the detection of 
the wavefront number, which is caused by the distance change by motion between the light source 
and the detector. The Doppler frequency f’ depends on the velocity of the observer vS and the sound 
source  v0;  if  the  observer  and  the  sound  source  are  leaving  each  other,  they  detect  the  frequency 
decline.  The  frequency  decline  depends  on  v0  and  vS.  Equation  (3)  indicates  that  the  frequency 
decline is independent of relative velocity v= v0- vS. 
  Now let us derive equation (1) using equations (3) and (2). The longitudinal Doppler shift can be 
derived  from  the  effects  of  the  geometrical  drawing  and  second-order  Doppler  shift  (the  Lorentz 
transformation of time). From equation (2), the second-order Doppler shift frequency fC is derived as   

In  equation  (3),  when  the  observer  is  at  rest,  v0  =0,  and  +  is  selected,  where  +  indicates  the

In  the  discussion  of  a  moving  sound  source,  the  frequency  fC  is  assumed  to  be  constant,  and  the 
frequency of the light source in motion is represented by fC in equation (4). Equation (6) is derived 
from equation (5) by introducing fC in equation (4), 

Equation (6) describes the longitudinal Doppler shift derived from the geometrical drawing and the 
Lorentz  transformation  of  time.  In  the  discussion  of  a  moving  light  source,  the  Lorentz 
transformation  of  time  is  needed.  In  the  discussion  of  the  twin  paradox,  the  time  delay  by  not  the 
geometrical drawing but the Lorentz transformation of time should be discussed. This is because the 
twin  paradox  occurs  from  the  Lorentz  transformation  of  time,  and  has  no  relation  to  geometrical 
drawing.  Therefore,  in  the  next  section,  we  show  that  the  paradox  occurs  from  the  second-order 
Doppler shift.   
 
2.2 Twin paradox 

A rocket starts from the earth as shown in Fig. 1 with an acceleration of 10 m/s2, which is on the 
order of gravitational acceleration. With this acceleration for 5,000 hours (~200 days), the speed of 
the  rocket  reaches  180,000 km/s  (60%  of  the  light  speed).  In  this  calculation,  the  effect  of  special 
relativity  is  neglected.  Therefore,  strictly  speaking,  we  cannot  reach  180,000  km/s  by  5,000-hour 
acceleration. The time delay of the 200-day acceleration is 9 ms, which is calculated using the effect

The relative velocity between the earth and rocket 2 is 180,000 km/s.

of acceleration, and the time delay is 45 µs/day by gravitational acceleration. This calculation does 
not  contain  the  effect  of  the  relative  motion.  After  200  days,  rocket  1  stops  its  acceleration  and 
maintains a velocity of 180,000 km/s, and rocket 2, which is carried by rocket 1, starts from rocket 1 
with an acceleration of 10 m/s2. After 200 days, the relative velocity between rocket 1 and the earth 
is  0.  The  time  delay  of  the  400-day  acceleration,  which  is  caused  only  by  acceleration,  is 
approximately 18 ms. Figure 2 shows the relative velocities of the three bodies after 400 days. We 
can carry out the discussion of the case without acceleration after 400 days.

Earth 

Let us compare the time gain of the three clocks on earth and in rockets 1 and 2. The time gain of 
the  clock  in  rocket  1  decreases  compared  with  that  of  the  clock  on  earth  according  to  the 
second-order  Doppler  shift.  When  rocket  2  is  considered  to  move  at  a  velocity  of  180,000  km/s 
compared with rocket 1, the time gain of the clock in rocket 2 decreases by the second-order Doppler 
shift. However, this discussion causes the twin paradox, because when the time gain of the clock in 
rocket 2 decreases compared with that of the clock in rocket 1, the time gain of the clock in rocket 2 
decreases  compared  with  that  of  the  clock  on  earth.  Thus,  there  is  a  difference  between  the  time 

 

5 

    Sato 

gains of the clocks in rocket 2 and on earth. However, the time gain of the clock in rocket 2 is equal 
to that of the clock on earth, indicating a paradox. Under the condition shown in Fig. 2, we discuss 
inertial systems in which no effect of acceleration is observed.   

We  can  measure  the  time  gain  of  the  clock  in  rocket  2.  There  are  the  time  delays  of  special 
relativity and 18 ms contributed by accelerated motion on the clock in rocket 2. Thus, acceleration 
does not play an important role in the solution of the twin paradox. 

We summarize the discussion of the paradox. The paradox does not arise from the special relative 
theory.  It  arises  from  the  assumption  that  all  inertial  frames  are  equivalent,  that  is,  there  is  no 
reference frame at rest. All inertial frames are equivalent for the Lorentz transformation of time, and 
hence, the reference frames for motion and time are not adopted. We consider that the assumption is 
incorrect, which leads to the paradox. 
 
3. PROPOSAL OF PARADOX DISSOLUTION 
  The reason the discussion falls into the paradox is based on the argument that rocket 2 leaves rocket 
1. The discussion when rocket 1 leaves the earth with a relative velocity of 180,000 km/s cannot be 
applied to the case of rocket 2 leaving rocket 1. After 400 days, as shown in Fig. 2, rocket 1 leaves 
the earth and rocket 2 with a relative velocity of 180,000 km/s. 

To dissolve the paradox, we have to adopt the reference frame of motion. The stationary frame of 
motion should be applied. Tentatively, we define the reference frame as the frame in which the time 
gains  the  fastest.  The  reference  of  time  is  the  light  speed,  in  which  we  follow  the  special  relative 
theory.  If  the  reference  frame  at  rest  is  defined,  we  can  define  the  relative  velocities  of  the  earth, 
rocket 1, and rocket 2. We obtain the same time gains on the earth and in rocket 2.   

This idea needs the reference frame at rest. Therefore, we have to give up the assumption that all 
frames are equivalent. This assumption became the trigger for the construction of a special relative 
theory.  The  relative  theory  does  not  deny  absolute  space  or  ether,  so  the  Lorentz  invariance  is 
satisfied, independent of the assumption of absolute space. 

Let us think about the second-order Doppler shift. When rocket 1 travels at a speed of 60% of the 
light speed, the time gain in rocket 1 decreases according to the second-order Doppler shift. On the 
other hand, the time gain in rocket 2 that travels in the direction opposite that of rocket 1 increases. 
The time delay by the second-order Doppler shift is dissolved, according to the acceleration in the 
direction opposite that of rocket 1. The time gain in rocket 2 increases according to the acceleration, 
and is equal to that on earth. This is because the earth is considered to be the reference frame at rest. 
The reference time t2 in rocket 2 should be represented as

where v2(t) is the relative velocity between rockets 1 and 2, v1-v2(t) is the relative velocity between 
rocket 2 and the earth, and t is the time after rocket 1 leaves rocket 2. (We define t as the time on the 
reference  frame  at  rest.)  After  200  days,  v1-v2(t)=0,  and  we  obtain  t2=t0.  Equation  (7)  shows  our 
assumption that the earth is the tentative reference frame, that is, we do not assume that all frames 
are equivalent.

4. DISCUSSION 
4.1 Comparison with conventional paradox 

We show the deference between this paradox and the conventional one. In the conventional one, 
the paradox occurs on the ages of the twins. This paradox is on the age gains of the twins. We can 
check the age gains on earth and in rocket 2 by signaling.   

We consider that if the space trip were carried out, the difference between the ages of the twins 
would be detected. However, acceleration and deceleration change the condition between the twins. 
We believe that the effects of acceleration and deceleration are negligible, that is, it is about 18 ms. 
Special  relativity  is  under  the  discussion  of  general  relativity,  thus  the  acceleration  should  be 
calculated.  At  this  stage,  we  conclude  that  the  effect  of  acceleration  is  negligible.  Under  the 
limitation  of  special  relativity,  we  discussed  three  bodies,  and  after  400  days  we  carried  out  the 
discussion within the special relative theory.   

In the conventional paradox, discussion is made such that the earth is assumed to be the reference 
frame at rest. Let us assume that the earth is not the reference frame at rest. For example, if the earth 
moves  at  60%  of  the  light  speed,  and  the  rocket  moves  in  the  direction  opposite  that  of  the  earth 
motion, we have to carry out the discussion that is previously carried out between rockets 1 and 2, 
that is, the clock in the rocket obtains a time gain by motion. Thus, we should accept the concept of 
not  only  clock  delay  but  also  time  gain  by  motion.  Time  gain  by  motion  is  caused  by  the 
second-order Doppler shift as shown in equation (7), which occurs according to the relative velocity 
against the reference frame at rest.   

 

4.2 Proposal   

Ashby [1] reported that “The GPS is a remarkable laboratory for applications of the concepts of 
special  and  general  relativity.”  We  also  propose  that  the  data  of  GPS  satellites  should  be  checked 
from the viewpoint of orbital deviation. We consider that the earth motion against space background 
radiation  can  be  detected  using  an  experimental  setup  of  GPS  satellites.  Of  course,  this  is  rather 
difficult, because a second-order Doppler shift of 4 km/s is detected.

where  vE  is  the  velocity  of  the  earth  against  space  background  radiation  and  vG(t)  is  the  orbital

critically  depends  on  the  direction  of  the  orbital  plane  against  space  background  radiation.  If  the 
orbital plane of the GPS satellites is parallel to the direction of the earth motion in space background

background radiation. 

There are 24 GPS satellites on 6 orbits (~20,000 km from the ground level) traveling at a velocity 
of 4 km/s, as shown in Fig. 3. This system is ideal for the experiment on special relativity. We can 
check whether the relative motion of the earth and GPS satellites against a reference frame at rest is 
detected. Of course, the second-order Doppler shift of 4 km/s is checked, so it is rather difficult. In 
the above-mentioned satellites, there are the eccentricity of the orbit and Sagnac effect [1], however 
they are ideal experimental setups for the tests on special relativity. 
 
5. CONCLUSION 

We  show  that  the  twin  paradox  is  not  due  to  acceleration,  and  propose  the  new  paradox  with 
which  acceleration  does  not  appear.  We  propose  that  the  dissolution  of  the  paradox  demands  a 
reference frame at rest, and the frame in which the time gains the fastest is defined as the reference 
frame  at  rest.  This  discussion  is  under  the  special  relative  theory;  however,  we  do not  exclude  the 
concept  of  absolute  space  and  ether.  The  relative  theory  has  been  sustained  by  tremendous 
experiments. However, I cannot agree with the interpretation of the relative theory, particularly the 
reference  frame  at  rest.  I  believe  that  the  twin  paradox  is  the  true  paradox,  and  we  should  only 
modify its interpretation. We also propose to check the periodic orbital reference time deviation of 
the order of ~10-8 in GPS satellites, which will be the evidence of the reference frame at rest.

The system of hydrodynamic-type  equations,  derived  by  two-side  distribution 
function  for  a  stratified  gas  in  gravity  field  is  applied  to  a  problem  of 
ultrasound.  The  theory  is  based  on  Gross-Jackson  kinetic  equation,  which 
solution  is  built  by  means  of  locally  equilibrium  distribution  function  with 
different  local  parameters  for  molecules  moving  "up"and  "down".  The 
background  state  and  linearized  version  of  the  obtained  system  is  studied  and 
compared with other results and experiments at arbitrary Knudsen numbers.
The  problem of a  generation  by a  moving plane in  a  rarefied gas is explored.
The  WKB  solutions  for  ultrasound  in  a  stratified  medium  are  constructed  in 
explicit form, evaluated and plotted.
Key  words:    ultrasound,  fluid  mechanics;  rarefied  gas  dynamics,  kinetic 
theory.

1. Introduction

Recently  the  problems  of  Kn  regime  wave  propagation  was  revisited  in  connection  with 
general fluid mechanics and nonsingular perturbation method development [1-3]. Generalized 
Boltzmann  theories [4-6]  also  contributed  in  a  progress  with  respect  to  this  important 
problem.

In  [7]  the  propagation  of  one-dimension  disturbance  was  studied  on  the  base  of    the 
method  of  a  piecewise  continuous  distribution  function  launched  in  a  pioneering  paper  of 
Lees  [8]  and  applied  for  a  gas  in  gravity  field  in  [1,9].  We  derived  hydrodynamic-type 
equations for a gas perturbations in gravity field so that the Knudsen number depends on the 
(vertical) coordinate. The generalization to three dimensions is given at [10,11].

In  a  recent  papers[7,10]  it  was  shown  that  for  speed  ratio  and  attenuation  factor  the 
BGK-model provides good agreement with experimental data[12,13]. Since the BGK-model 
has a Prandtl number 1, wich is incorrect for monatomic gases, a certain judicious choice of 
mean  free  path  is  always  required.  It  is  of  interest  here to  examine  the  higher  order  kinetic 
model to assess the model dependence of the results. We have considered one such class of 
higher order models, the Gross-Jackson model[14], in this paper.

2. Generalized fluid dynamics equations

The  derivation  of  the  hydrodynamic-type  equations  is  based  on  Gross-Jackson  kinetic 

equation[14], that looks in one-dimensional case like:

Following  the  idea  of  the  method  of  piecewise  continuous  distribution  functions  let's 
search  for  the  solution    of  the  equations(1)  as  a  combination  of  two  locally  equilibrium 
distribution functions, each of which gives the contribution in its own area of velocities space:

The  increase  of  the  number  of  parameters  of  distribution  function  results  in  that  the 
distribution  function  differs  from  a  local-equilibrium  one  and  describes  deviations  from 
hydrodynamical  regime.  In  the  range  of  small  Knudsen  numbers

  and  distribution  function  reproduces  the  hydrodynamics

Navier-Stokes equations. In the range of big Knudsen numbers the theory gives solutions of 
collisionless problems [9].

Hence a modification of the procedure for deriving fluid mechanics (hydrodynamic-type) 
equations  from  the  kinetic  theory  is  proposed,  it  generalizes  the  Navier-Stokes  at  arbitrary 
density (Knudsen numbers).

Our  method  gives  a  reasonable  agreement  with  the  experimental  data  in  the  case  of 

homogeneous  gas  [7].  In  the  paper[7]  the  expressions  for 
some nonlinear terms, that finally lead to more exact results in transition region.

The solution of the equation (12) at any u is evaluated numerically. As an illustration let us 
consider a problem of generation and propagation of a gas disturbance, by a plane oscillating 
with a given frequency 
0 . We restrict ourselves by the case of homogeneous gas, because it 
is the only case of existing experimental realization. We evaluate numerically the propagation 
velocity and attenuation factor of a linear sound. 

Fig.1. The inverse non-dimensional phase velocity as a function of the
  inverse Knudsen number. The results of this paper for Gross-Jackson 

model-1 are compared to BGK model-2, Navier-Stokes, previous our 

work [7]-3 and the experimental data [12,13] -circle.

Fig. 2. The attenuation factor of the linear disturbance as a function 

of the inverse Knudsen number.

The kinetic theory[15,17] gives the good agreement with the experimental data at arbitrary 
Kn  numbers.  The  Navier–Stokes  prediction  is  qualitatively  wrong  at  big  Knudsen  number. 
Our  results  for  phase  speed  give  the  good  consistency  with  the  experiments  at  all  Knudsen 
numbers.  However,  our  results  for  the  attenuation  of  ultrasound  are  good  (as  we  can  see  in 
experiment)  only  for  the  number  r  up  to  order  unity.  But  our  results  look  a  bit  better  than 
Navier–Stokes, Alexeev [4], Chen–Rao–Spiegel[2,3] and regularization of Grad’s method[18]. 
Unlike BGK model using the Gross-Jackson one gives right coefficients of viscosity and heat 
conductivity.

5. Conclusions

In this paper we propose a one-dimensional theory of linear disturbances in a gas, stratified in 
gravity  field,  hence  propagating  through  regions  with  crucially  different  Kn  numbers.  The 
regime  of  the  propagation  dramatically  changes  from  a  typically  hydrodynamic  to  the 
free-molecular  one.  We  also  studied  three-dimensional  case [10,11].  Generally the  theory  is 
based  on  Gross-Jackson  kinetic  equation,  which  solution  is  built  by  means  of  locally 
equilibrium  distribution function  with  different local  parameters  for  molecules  moving  "up" 
and "down". Equations for six moments yields in the closed fluid mechanics system. For the 
important generalizations of the foundation of such theory see the recent review of Alexeev 
[4].

Abstract. We show that the transformation equations for the parameters that characterize 
a plane acoustic wave: period, (frequency), wave vector, wave length and phase velocity 
can be derived without using phase invariance and Lorentz-Einstein transformation. 
 
Introduction. 
1. 
Moller1 derives transformation equations for the parameters introduced in order to 
 
characterize  a  plane  acoustic  wave.    Resnick2  and  Rosser3  present  the  same  problem  in 
the  case  of  a  plane  electromagnetic  wave  propagating  in  a  vacuum.  The  mentioned 
parameters are unit vector n that characterizes the direction in which the wave propagates 
.The parameters are measured in 
 and wave length 
with phase velocity w, frequency 
the  K(XOY)  reference  frame  using  rulers  and  synchronized  clocks  following  the 
synchronization  procedure  proposed  by  Einstein4.  The  same  parameters  measured  by 
. The axes of the 
observers from the K’(X’O’Y’) reference frame are n’, w’, 
two reference frames are parallel to each other, K’ moves with velocity V relative to K in 
the  positive  direction  of  the  common  OX(O’X’)  axes.  At  the  origin  of  time  in  the  two 
reference frames the origins O and O’ of the two frames are located at the same point in 
space. Deriving transformation equations for the parameters mentioned above the authors 
invoke  the  invariance  of  the  phase  of  a  wave  and  perform  the  Lorentz-Einstein 
transformations of the space-time coordinates used in order to express the phase1,2,3. This 
approach leads to transformation equations for all the parameters.  
can  be  derived  without  using  phase 
 
invariance  special  relativity  being  involved  only  via  the  time  dilation  effect.  It  holds 
exactly when the involved periods are very small.5

acoustic wave. 
Detected from K, the parallel rays of the plane acoustic wave propagate along  a 
 
direction that makes an angle 
 with the positive direction of the OX axis. One of the 
rays arrives at the origin O when clock C0(0,0)  located there reads t=0. After a time t of 
propagation  the  ray  arrives  at  the  point  M(x,y).  The  phase  of  the  harmonic  oscillations 
taking place in the wave is  when detected from K and 
when detected from K’. The 
invariance of the phase requires that

wave,  knowing  that  x,y,t   and  x’,y’t’ transform in  accordance  with  the  Lorentz-Einstein 
transformations for the space-time coordinates of the same event. Even if the derivations 
are straightforward they are not very transparent as they are rather formal and obscuring 
the physics behind wave relativity.6 
 
We  consider  that  when  we  speak  about  a  given  physical  quantity  we  should 
mention the observer who performs the measurement, where and when he performs it and 
the measuring devices he uses. What we measure in a Doppler Effect experiment is time 
intervals5  (periods)  which  enable  us  to  calculate  the  corresponding  frequencies.  The 
frequencies 
 in (1) are instantaneous frequencies defined as the time derivatives 
of the phase 

 and 

 
We present a simple and transparent derivation of the transformation equation for 
frequency  (Doppler  formula).  Consider  the  ray  that  arrives  at  the  origin  O  of    K  when 
clock C(0,0) reads te. After a given time of propagation the ray arrives at the location of a 
)  that  reads  tr.  We  define  the  location  of  the  clock  using 
clock
Cartesian  (x,y)  and  polar  (r,
)  space  coordinates.  It  is  obvious  that  the readings  of  the 
two clocks are related by

Equation (6) holds for each value of te and we are specifically interested in the case te=0. 
By definition dte represents a proper time interval measured as a difference between the 
  records  a

 We  can  consider  that  dte  represents  a  proper  time  interval  during  which  an  observer 
of the K frame receives and emits successive wave crests of the 

wave,  with

  of  K’  receives  the  same  wave  crests  of  the  same  wave. 
Knowing  that  in  a  Doppler  Effect  experiment  we  compare  the  period  at  which  two 
successive wave crests are emitted, measured in the rest frame of the source (K), with the 
period  at  which  they  are  received  measured  in  the  observer’s  rest  frame  (K’),  we  can

behind it: 
- It holds exactly only in the case of “very small periods” (“very high frequencies”), small 
does 
enough that it can be considered  that during the time intervals dte (
not change, with  
receiving two successive wave crests being located at the same point 
in  space.  Relativists  say  that  we  make  the  “locality  assumption”  in  the  period 
measurement  by  a  moving  observer.8  We  find  a  similar  situation  in  the  case  of  an 
accelerating  observer  whose  velocity  changes  during  the  reception  of  two  successive 
wave crests.9 
 -The Lorentz-Einstein transformation performed in Moller’s approach1 relates the space-
time coordinates of the event “observer R’ detects two successive wave  crests from the 
same point in space”.  
-Equation (9) holds only for the ray which arrives at the origin O of the K frame when 
clock C0(0,0) reads a zero time.

the parameters that characterize a plane acoustic wave without using the phase invariance 
and the Lorentz-Einstein transformations. Special relativity is involved in our derivations 
via  the  time  dilation  formula  which  is  itself  a  direct  consequence  of  the  principle  of 
relativity.

We recognise in the left hand side and in the right hand side of (22) the dot product of the

As we know the dot product of two “three vectors” is a relativistic invariant in accordance 
with  the  invariance  of  the  phase.  Corresponding  components  of  two  “three  vectors” 
transform via the same transformation factors and so we should have

4. 
 
We  have  shown  that  the  transformation  equations  for  the  parameters  that 
characterize  a  plane  acoustic  or  electromagnetic  wave  can  be  derived  without  invoking 
the invariance of the phase. The transformation equation for the frequency holds exactly 
only in the case of very small period assumption (locality in the period measurement by a 
moving  observer)  and  of  course  in  the  case  of  the  plane  wave  assumption  (very  big 
source-receiver distance).

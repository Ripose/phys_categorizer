On the Positioning
of Objects in Space

Abstract

The personal spatial structure of an observer is introduced as  a  central
element in the positioning of objects  in  space.    The  link  between  a  reference
frame  used  by  an  observer  and  his  personal  spatial  structure  is  discussed.
Research on inversion or reversal of incoming light in psychology indicates that
the personal spatial structure of an individual, as well as a reference frame that
he uses,  depends on the internal  coordination  of  sensory  stimuli  and  that  the
position of objects in space depends in part on psychological factors  that affect
one(cid:213)s personal spatial structure.  Other  research  in  psychology  demonstrating
the flexibility for an observer in determining the direction of up-down relative to
a particular figure, and indeed relative to the entire surround,  is also noted and
supports the thesis that the observer plays a role in the positioning of objects in
space.

On  a  practical  basis,  an  individual  knows  about  space  through  the
employment of a spatial structure delineated by a set of spatial axes for height
(up-down),  width (right-left), and depth (in-out).  Using  this  spatial  structure,
the individual gauges to a high degree of accuracy the spatial position of objects
in the world, such that he is able to perform intricate coordinated sensori-motor
actions  in  the  world.1    The  use  of  a  formal  spatial  coordinate  system  is  an
extension of one(cid:213)s personal spatial structure.  It  is  because  of  one(cid:213)s  personal
spatial  structure  that  an  individual  can  employ  and  understand  more  formal
spatial reference frames.2

Evidence supporting these  theses  comes  from  work  on  inversion  and
reversal of all incoming light (e.g.,  Dolezal 1982; Erismann &  Kohler,  1953,
1958;  Pronko  &  Snyder,  1951;  Snyder  &  Pronko,  1952;  Stratton,  1896,
1897a, 1897b).  It was found that when there is inversion or reversal of light to
the retina, the observer adapts both behaviorally and perceptually such that the

                                    
1  Asch and Witkin  (e.g.,  1948a) investigated  this  spatial  structure  and  called  it  a  reference
frame.
2 In our daily life and in Newtonian mechanics, a reference frame is a spatial coordinate system
associated  with  a  physical  object.    A  temporal  coordinate  system  is  associated  with  the
reference frame.  In relativity theory, a reference frame is a spatiotemporal coordinate system.

observer  can  function  largely,  if  not  totally,  in  the  way  in  which  he  was
functioning before incoming light was inverted and without  awareness that the
pattern of incoming light has been  altered.    Before  adaptation  the  position  of
objects in the visual field is altered, the degree depending on the nature of the
alteration of incoming light.  Adaptation can be accounted for in terms of a shift
of  the  observer(cid:213)s  personal  spatial  structure.    A  person(cid:213)s  spatial  structure
depends  on  the  internal  coordination  of  sensory  stimuli,  for  it  is  this
coordination  of  sensory  stimuli,  notably  touch  and  vision,  that  allows  for
adaptation.  The shift in one(cid:213)s personal spatial  structure  upon  adaptation  then
also affects the formal spatial reference frame used by these observers in their
scientific investigation of the physical world.  One such joining of the x,  y, and
z axes of a spatial reference frame and one(cid:213)s personal spatial structure is shown
in Figure 1 (page 3).  In this figure:

The z axis is in the vertical direction relative to the subject,
appearing to go up and down.

The y axis runs perpendicular to the ideal plane formed by
the subject’s face, appearing to go in and out.

The x  axis runs  horizontally  relative  to  the  subject,  from
side to side.

This sample spatial structure and the accompanying spatial coordinate system is
really Euclidean in nature, where unit distance is maintained and where one can
use measuring instruments of unit length to form a grid of squares throughout
space.

In the verification of the general theory of relativity, it is interesting that
in the determination of the observation of the motion of light rays passing close
to the sun during a solar eclipse, observers  are not inside the curved reference
frame where the motion of light rays appears straight (within the context of this
reference frame).  Instead, it is a curved path traveled by the light rays as they
pass by the sun that is observed (Einstein, 1917/1961).   An observer on earth
applies  his  essentially  Euclidean  (non-curved)  spatial  framework  to  the  light
rays traveling in curved spacetime near the sun  and observes that the paths  of
the light rays near the sun curve.  This observer(cid:213)s perception occurs because the

spatial coordinate system used by an individual is rooted in the personal spatial
structure of an individual, which in this case is Euclidean.3

Generally, physicists have not allowed that the spatial coordinate system
in  physics  used  to  position  a  physical  existent  is  influenced  by  the  personal
spatial structure of the individual.  It is assumed that the structure of space,  in
particular its orientation, is unaffected by the perceptual and cognitive activities
of  the  observer.4    Figure  2  (page  4)  shows  how  the  spatial  structure  of  the
individual  might  be  accounted  for  if  the  structure  of  space  is  considered
independent of the human observer and yet a (cid:210)subjective(cid:211) spatial structure and
accompanying (cid:210)subjective(cid:211) spatial coordinate system is allowed.

Our functioning in the physical world in our  daily  lives  is  remarkably
good  and  dependent  on  our  personal  spatial  structure  being  accurate  in  its
application to the physical world.5  Where there is assumed to be an objective
positioning  of  objects  in  space  not  influenced  by  the  perceiving  person,  the
the  (cid:210)objective(cid:211)
correspondence  of  the  (cid:210)subjective(cid:211)  spatial  structure 
positioning of objects in space would have to be good indeed.  The presumed
dichotomy  between  the  (cid:210)objective(cid:211)  positioning  of  objects  in  space  and  a
(cid:210)subjective(cid:211) spatial coordinate system is one basis for the dichotomy between a
(cid:210)subjective(cid:211)  spatiality  and  the  objective  space  that  many  have  maintained
exists.6    Where  a  dichotomy  is  presumed,  the  (cid:210)subjective(cid:211)  space  may  be  in
error,  due  to  psychological  factors,  when  it  is  considered  in  relationship  to
(cid:210)objective(cid:211) space.  In this view, one could conceivably have a situation like that

to 

                                    
3  It  is  possible  that  the  personal spatial  structure  of  an  observer  need  not  be  Euclidean  in
nature, as phenomenological investigation has shown (e.g., Merleau-Ponty, 1945/1994).   The
implications  of  this  finding  on  an  observer(cid:213)s  employment  of  spatial  coordinate  systems
embodied in reference frames needs to be investigated.
4 The alterations in the nature of space and time in relativity theory are generally considered to
be dependent on factors other than human  cognition.    In  relativity  theory,  though  there is  an
acknowledgment  of  flexibility  in  the  choice  of  reference  systems,  particularly  in  special
relativity,  this  flexibility  is  generally  limited  to  the  choice  of  the  reference  frame,  a
spatiotemporal  coordinate system,  and is  considered  not  to  depend  directly  on  an  observer  at
rest  in  a  reference  frame.   In  the  special  theory,  the  relationship  between  inertial  reference
frames is  generally  considered to  depend  only  on  the  invariant  velocity  of  light  in  inertial
reference frames in uniform translational velocity  relative to  one  another  without  taking  into
account the reasoning necessary to account for the relativity of simultaneity (Snyder, 1994).
5 It is not as accurate as  various  physical  measuring systems  are,  but  to  a  significant  degree,
people are able to gauge distance accurately.   This  is  what  allows  for our  very precise  motor
behavior that is guided by our perception.
6 This objective spatial coordinate system is not  the  absolute space of  Newtonian  mechanics.
It is simply considered to be independent of cognition.

depicted  in  Figure  3  (page  6),  showing  the  individual(cid:213)s  (cid:210)subjective(cid:211)  spatial
perception to be in error.

Evidence  previously  cited  supporting  perceptual  and  behavioral
adaptation  of  inversion  of  light  to  the  eye  supports  the  thesis  that  cognition
affects the formal reference frames employed  by  individuals.    Other  evidence
concerns  the  phenomenon  known  as  position  constancy,  that  the  perceived
orientation  of  an  object  in  space  tends  to  remain  the  same  despite  different
retinal images of the object (Rock,  1974/1997; Wallach, 1959).    But  position
constancy is affected by which directions the observer perceives up-down and
right-left, for example.  An example is the perception of the form on the left in
Figure 4 (page 7) as a square where the square(cid:213)s top and bottom are extended
along  the  horizontal  of  the  manuscript  page.    Referring  to  the  (cid:210)top(cid:211)  and
(cid:210)bottom(cid:211)  of  the  square  indicates  the  positioning  of  the  square  in  a  personal
spatial  structure  where,  in  terms  of  the  square,  up  and  down  point  in  the
directions shown in Figure 5 (page 9).   If the square aligned along the vertical
of the page is rotated 45o counterclockwise  (the right form in Figure 4)  and the

two corners are perceived to point up and down,  the figure is perceived to be a
diamond.  Here up-down  remains aligned  along  the  length  of  the  manuscript
page,  as shown  in Figure 5  (page  8).    If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  observer(cid:213)s
sense  of  up-down  and  right-left  has  also  rotated  counterclockwise  with  the
form,  the observer still  perceives  a  square.    In  the  latter  case,  up  and  down
point  in  the  directions  indicated  in  Figure  6  (page  8).    These  directions

(up-down and right-left) themselves  may be affected by other percepts that are
themselves subject to factors besides the retinal image.7

Figure 6. Up and down for right form in Figure

In Figure 4, that the sides of the square on the left are equal in length is
readily perceived due to the  necessity  of  right  angles  in  the  square.    For  the
figure  on  the  right  side,  that  the  sides  are  of  equal  length  is  not  so  readily
perceived.  That they are equal comes after consideration of the figure, either of
its  angles,  comparing  the  lengths  of  its  sides,  or  seeing  that  the  figure  is  a
square when up and down are on the diagonal.

                                    
7  Also,  the  example  above  indicates  that  spatial  orientation  may  be  layered.    That  is,
perception of a figure depends on the spatial context relevant to that figure.

Other studies provide evidence  of  adaptation  to  alteration  in  incoming
light and indicate the role of cognition in visual perception.   For  example, early
on Helmholtz (1866/1925) reported a study in which a subject wore prisms that
displaced objects laterally to the left from what would have  been  their  normal
position had the subject not worn the prisms.  After repeated trials reaching for
an object while looking at the object, the subject gained the ability to correctly
touch the object with his eyes closed.  Moreover, upon removal of the prisms,
the subject had a negative aftereffect where the subject initially reached for the
object in the direction too far to the right.  After a certain number of failures, the
subject adapted to not wearing the prisms.

In  a  series  of  studies  involving  tilting  of  objects  in  the  environment
relative to the subject (Asch & Witkin, 1948a,  1948b; Witkin & Asch,  1948a,
1948b),  the roles of orientation of the visual field  relative  to  the  observer,  as
well as gravity, in perception of the upright have been demonstrated, indicating
an  integrative  feature  of  perception.    Similarly,  the  perception  of  motion
depends on whether an object(cid:213)s perceived change of location can be accounted
for by head and/or eye movement.  Again, changing the position of the retinal
image does not in and of itself account for motion, as an observer(cid:213)s  tracing  a
moving  object  keeps  the  retinal  image  of  the  object  essentially  in  the  same
retinal location.  Rock (1974/1997) discussed  the square and diamond percepts
noted above in the context of a theory of (cid:210)indirect(cid:211) perception.  In a number of
experiments performed by Rock and others,  it has been shown  that perception
is  a  cognitive  endeavor,  where  percept-to-percept  relationships  form  a
hierarchical  backbone  to  that  which  an  individual  finally  perceives  (Rock,
1997).

Though it has been demonstrated that the personal spatial structure and
reference frame used by an individual are affected by cognition, what does this
have to do with the measurement of space and time in physics?   The key is that
in  experiments  like  those  conducted  by  Stratton,  where  all  incoming  light  is
rotated  by  some  constant  degree,  the  observer  is  in  a  new  situation  when
adaptation  occurs.8    Adaptation  implies  that  there  is  no  objective  spatial
structure  independent  of  the  observer.    If  there  were  an  objective  spatial
structure  and  given  adaptation,  how  would  an  observer  know  it?9    It  was

                                    
8  In  Stratton(cid:213)s  experiments,  light  was  inverted,  that  is  rotated  180o  by  the  use  of  a  lens
system.
9  Consider  the  following  observation reported by  the  subject  in  Snyder  and Pronko(cid:213)s  study,
who  happened to  be  Snyder, that  supports  adaptation.   This  observation  also  indicates  that

Demonstrating that perceptual constancy, including what a figure is, can
be  altered  by  spatial  rotation  of  the  object,  and  can  be  restored  by  a
corresponding  rotation  of  the  observer(cid:213)s  sense  of  up-down  and  right-left,
provides support that a figure(cid:213)s spatial orientation (whether it is up, down, or in
some other orientation) and attendant effects regarding figural spatial extension
for example are affected by the observer.   This is a key finding in  supporting
perceptual and behavioral adaptation to inversion of incoming light.  First,  this
result supports the possibility that the spatial orientation of an  observer(cid:213)s entire
visual  world,  and  the  changes  in  spatial  structure  that  result,  can  change.
Second,  as these effects are due to the  observer,  the  possibility  of  adaptation
and its being accounted for in terms of a shift of the observer(cid:213)s personal spatial
structure is supported.  Because of the significance of the observer in affecting
spatial structure, the thesis that  the  formal  spatial  structure  represented  in  the
frame of reference he employs is associated directly with the adapted observer(cid:213)s
personal spatial structure is supported.   The distinction between an (cid:210)objective(cid:211)
spatial structure and a (cid:210)subjective(cid:211) one is not supported.  The use of a reference

                                                                                               
something has changed  for the  subject  with  inversion  of  light,  but  only  when the  historical
event of the inversion of light to the subject is attended to.

Toward  the  end of  the  experiment  [i.e.,  the  period  in  which  the  subject  wore  the
inverting  glasses],  the  subject  was  adequately  adjusted  [adapted].    The  following
insightful  experience occurred.   He  was  observing  the  scene  from  a  tall  building.
Suddenly  someone  asked,  (cid:210)Well,  how  do  things  look  to  you?    Are  they  upside-
down?(cid:211)
The subject  replied, (cid:210)I wish  you  hadn(cid:213)t asked me.    Things  were all  right  until  you
popped the question at  me.    Now,  when I  recall  how  they  did look  before I  put  on
these lenses,  I  must  answer  that  they  do  look  upside  down  now.    But  until  the
moment that you asked me I was absolutely unaware of it and hadn(cid:213)t given a  thought
to  the  question  of  whether  things  were  right-side-up  or  upside-down.(cid:211)  (Snyder  &
Pronko, 1952, p. 113)

An historical event, namely the donning of  inverting  glasses,  presents the  basis  for knowing
that  there  is  a  difference  between  normal  presentation  of  incoming  light  and  inversion  of
incoming light.  This event has meaning for the  subject,  Snyder, in  the  above quote through
his  memory  of  the  pre-inversion  situation.    This  memory  does  not  affect  the  subject(cid:213)s
perception and perceptually-guided  action  where  the  historical  event  of  inverting  incoming
light is not attended to.

frame in making precise measurements reflects the actual position of objects in
the physical world  for  that  observer.    This  situation  is  like  that  portrayed  in
Figure 1.

One might  still  ask,  if  everything  comes  out  okay  in  the  end,  that  is
everything  is  still  lined  up  correctly  in  the  personal  spatial  structure,  the
individual(cid:213)s (cid:210)subjective(cid:211) reference frame, and an (cid:210)objective(cid:211) spatial structure in
the physical world, then of what significance is this finding?  First,  the finding
brings the human observer into line with the implications of the special theory
of relativity on the significant role of the human observer in the development of
spacetime  structure  (Snyder,  1994).10    Second,  the  finding  indicates  that  a
primary result in the theory of quantum mechanics is limited in scope.   That is,
with  this  finding,  it  becomes  possible  to  know  two  quantities  that  within
quantum  mechanics  are  mutually  exclusive,  albeit  in  two  different  formal
reference frames reflecting different personal spatial structures.   For  example,
the  spin  components  for  an  electron  along  orthogonal  spatial  axes  may  be
simultaneously  known,  albeit  within  two  different  formal  reference  frames
(Snyder,  1992,  1993,  1995).    This  finding  definitely  holds  for  different
observers.    Because  of  the  possibility  of  biperceptual  capabilities  concerning
simultaneous personal spatial structures for an individual (e.g., Dolezal, 1982),
this finding  allows  for  the  possibility  that  a  single  observer  may  know  both
quantities  through  employing  two  distinct  reference  frames  simultaneously.

Investigating  psychological  variables  concerning  perception  can  lead 
understanding the physical world itself in addition to perception.11

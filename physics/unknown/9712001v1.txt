The condition of self-adjointness ensures that the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian are real and bounded
below. However, if one replaces this condition by the weaker condition of PT symmetry, one obtains
new inﬁnite classes of Hamiltonians whose spectra are also real and positive. The classical and
quantum properties of some of these Hamiltonians are discussed in this paper.

Several years ago, D. Bessis conjectured on the basis of
numerical studies that the spectrum of the Hamiltonian
H = p2 + x2 + ix3 is real and positive [1]. To date there
is no rigorous proof of this conjecture, but it is now clear
to us that the Hamiltonian studied by Bessis is just one
of a huge and remarkable class of non-Hermitian Hamil-
tonians whose energy levels are real and positive. To il-
lustrate the properties of such Hamiltonians, we examine
here the class of quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians

We report extensive numerical and asymptotic studies

Fig. 1, when m = 0 the spectrum of H exhibits three
distinct behaviors as a function of N . When N

lies the harmonic oscillator. A kind of phase transition
occurs at N = 2; when 1 < N < 2, there are only a
ﬁnite number of real positive eigenvalues and an inﬁnite
number of complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues. As N
decreases from 2 to 1, adjacent energy levels merge into
complex conjugate pairs beginning at the high end of the
spectrum; ultimately, the only remaining real eigenvalue

When N

FIG. 1. Energy levels of the Hamiltonian H = p2 − (ix)N
as a function of the parameter N . There are three regions:
When N ≥ 2 the spectrum is real and positive. The lower
bound of this region, N = 2, corresponds to the harmonic
oscillator, whose energy levels are En = 2n + 1. When
1 < N < 2, there are a ﬁnite number of real positive eigen-
values and an inﬁnite number of complex conjugate pairs of
eigenvalues. As N decreases from 2 to 1, the number of real
eigenvalues decreases; when N ≤ 1.42207, the only real eigen-
value is the ground-state energy. As N approaches 1+, the
ground-state energy diverges. For N ≤ 1 there are no real
eigenvalues.

Quantum ﬁeld theories analogous to the quantum-
mechanical theory in Eq. (1) have remarkable properties.

this theory has a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, the spec-

L is explicitly not parity invariant, so the expectation
is nonzero, even when N = 4 [4]. Su-

Ordinarily, the boundary conditions that give quantized
energy levels E are that ψ(x)

real axis; this condition suﬃces when 1 < N < 4. How-
ever, for arbitrary real N we must continue the eigenvalue
problem for (2) into the complex-x plane. Thus, we re-
place the real-x axis by a contour in the complex plane
along which the diﬀerential equation holds and we im-
pose the boundary conditions that lead to quantization
at the endpoints of this contour. (Eigenvalue problems
on complex contours are discussed in Ref. [7].)

The opening angle of these wedges is ∆ = 2π/(N + 2).
The diﬀerential equation (2) may be integrated on any
path in the complex-x plane so long as the ends of the
path approach complex inﬁnity inside the left wedge and
the right wedge [9]. Note that these wedges contain the
real-x axis when 1 < N < 4.

As N increases from 2, the left and right wedges rotate

no eigenvalue problem at all. Indeed, Fig. 1 shows that
the eigenvalues all diverge as N

upper-half x plane. At N = 1 the angular opening of
the wedges is 2

imaginary x axis, and the diﬀerential equation contour

In these wedges ψ(x)
vanishes exponentially as |x| → ∞. The wedges are bounded
by Stokes lines of the diﬀerential equation. The center of the
wedge, where ψ(x) vanishes most rapidly, is an anti-Stokes
line.

To ensure the accuracy of our numerical computations
of the eigenvalues in Fig. 1, we have solved the diﬀeren-
tial equation (2) using two independent procedures. The
most accurate and direct method is to convert the com-
plex diﬀerential equation to a system of coupled, real,
second-order equations which we solve using the Runge-
Kutta method; the convergence is most rapid when we
integrate along anti-Stokes lines. We then patch the two
solutions together at the origin.

An alternative procedure is to diagonalize a truncated
matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) in
harmonic oscillator basis functions e−x2/2Hn(x):

The K-th approximant to the spectrum comes from the
matrix Mm,n (0

method is that the eigenvalues of Mm,n approximate
those of Eq. (2) only if 1 < N < 4. Furthermore, the con-
vergence to the exact eigenvalues is slow and not mono-
tone because the Hamiltonian (1) is not Hermitian. The
convergence of this truncation and diagonalization pro-
cedure is illustrated in Fig. 3 for N = 3

Semiclassical analysis: Several features of Fig. 1 can be
veriﬁed analytically. When N
2, WKB gives an excel-
lent approximation to the spectrum. The novelty of this
WKB calculation is that it must be performed in the
complex plane. The turning points x± are those roots of
E + (ix)N = 0 that analytically continue oﬀ the real axis
as N moves away from N = 2 (the harmonic oscillator):

lower-half x plane and when N = 2 the path lies on the
real axis. But, when N < 2 the path is in the upper-
half x plane; it crosses the cut on the positive-imaginary
axis and thus is not a continuous path joining the turning
points. Hence, WKB fails when N < 2.

Asymptotic study of the ground-state energy near N = 1:
When N = 1, the diﬀerential equation (2) can be solved

The onset of eigenvalue merging may be regarded as
a phase transition. This transition occurs even at the
classical level. Consider the classical equations of motion
(Newton’s law) for a particle of energy E subject to the
complex forces described by the Hamiltonian (1). For
m = 0 the trajectory x(t) of the particle obeys
dx[E +
(ix)N ]−1/2 = 2dt. While E and dt are real, x(t) is a path
in the complex plane in Fig. 2; this path terminates at
the classical turning points x± in (5).

At N = 2 there is a global change. For N < 2 a path
starting at one turning point, say x+, moves toward but
misses the turning point x−. This path spirals outward
crossing from sheet to sheet on the Riemann surface, and
eventually veers oﬀ to inﬁnity asymptotic to the angle

total angular rotation of the spiral is ﬁnite

energies once again disappear in pairs, but now the parity
of the merging levels is shifted. As N

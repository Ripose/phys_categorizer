Abstract  —  Few examples of the exploitation of molecular 
magnetic  properties  in  molecular  electronics  are  known  to 
date.  Here  we  propose    the  realization  of  Self  assembled 
monolayers  (SAM)  of  a  particular  stable  organic  radical. 
This radical is meant to be used as a standard  molecule on 
which to prove the validity of a single spin reading procedure 
known  as    ESR-STM  [1].  We  demonstrate  here  that  the 
radical  is  chemically  anchored  at  the  surface,  preserves  its 
magnetic functionality and can be imaged by STM. STM and 
ESR investigations of the molecular film is reported. We also 
discuss  a  range  of  possible  applications,  further  than  ESR-
STM,  of  magnetic  monolayers  of  simple  purely  organic 
magnetic molecules.

I. INTRODUCTION

transport  properties  can  be  used 

The use of the magnetic degree of freedoms in molecular 
electronics has been absent or restricted to a few specific 
cases.  Transport  investigations  at  the  single  molecular 
level  are  generally  aimed  at  understanding  how  electrons 
flow  through  single  molecules  and  how  the  single 
molecular 
the 
implementation of single molecular devices. Only recently 
the  spin  coupling  between  a  single  molecule  and  the 
contacts leads has proven to give Kondo effect (A typical 
magnetic  effect  arising  from  the  coupling  between  the 
spin of an impurity an the electrons of a metal) [2]. Much 
work  is  present  in  the  physics  of  quantum  dots.  In  these 
system the spin of the dot is controlled by controlling the 
overall  amount  of  electrons  staying  within  the  dots.  Spin 
in  these  systems  can  be  used  as  resource  to  carry 
information  [2].  However  the  control  of  the  number  of 
electrons by charging effect  requires   Coulomb blockade 
regime.  That  means  that    the  resistance  between  the 
contact  leads  and  the  dot  must  drastically  exceed  the 
quantum resistance. Moreover the thermal energy must be 
smaller than the dot charging energy resulting in very low 
temperatures  experimental  conditions.  The  former  two 
constraints  limit 
  the  applicability  of  the  magnetic 
properties of a single DOT for technologic purposes.

in  ordered 

superstructures 

 
Moreover  a  quantum  dot  created  by 
lithographic 
techniques  is  still  considerably  bigger  than  a  simple 
organic  molecule.  The  use  of  molecules  in  place  of 
semiconductor  dots,  would  drastically  shrink  the  size  of 
the  information  storing  unit.    Also  molecules  offer  the 
possibility  to  be  self  assembled  at  surface  and  do  not 
to  be 
lithographic 
require  necessarily 
organized 
(bottom  up 
approach). 
Purely  organic  molecules  (radicals)  offer  instead  the 
possibility to accommodate unpaired electrons coupled to 
intra-molecular  exchange 
each  other  by  means  of 
interaction [3]. By chemical engineering,  the  overall spin 
of  a  molecule  can  be  varied  till  large  numbers  (S=9..). 
Intra  molecular  ferromagnetic  coupling  is  active  also  at 
room  temperature  giving  rise  in  same  cases  to  molecules 
with  overall  spin  number  S=1/2,1,  3/2,  2  at  room 
temperature.  
We  needed to  find  nanoscale   paramagnets  to be ordered 
on  a  surface  as    probe  systems  on  which  to  seek  for    a 
Radio Frequency (RF) resonance in the tunneling current 
flowing  between  the  tip  of  an  STM  microscope  and  an 
underneath  magnetic  nanostructure  (  an  experiment 
known as ESR-STM [1]). The candidate molecule for this 
experiment  should  satisfy  a  number  of  conditions:  a) 
being  anchored  on  a  conductive  surface,  b)  ensuring  that 
its magnetism is preserved, c) the intrinsic conductivity of 
the  molecule  must  allow  STM  operation,  d) 
  the 
magnetism  of  the  molecule  is  not  suppressed  during 
tunneling  into  and  from  its  molecular  orbitals,  e)  the 
overall  amount  of  current  flowing  into  the  molecule 
should be sufficient to provide a detachable RF signal. 
In  this  paper  we  demonstrate  that  a  self  assembled 
monolayer of magnetic organic radicals satisfy to the first 
3 (a-c) requirements. 

II. MAGNETIC MOLECULAR  SYSTEMS 

We  have  opted  to  use  a  magnetic  radical  with  S=1/2 
belonging  to  the  class  of    Nitronyl-Nitroxides.    In 
particular  the  molecule  studied  in  this  work  is  the

molecule  on to Au surfaces. The phenyl spacer is known 
to  have  conductivity  superior  to  standard  alkan  thiols 
resulting  in  a  better  choice  for  STM  imaging.    Fig.  1c 
shows the ESR spectrum of the molecule in solution.  The 
spectrum is composed of 5 lines arising from the coupling 
of  the  S=1/2  with  the  two  14N  (I=1)  nuclei.  On  cooling 
the hyperfine structure is smeared out as expected. This is 
due  to  the  fact  that  molecules  freeze  each  at  a  particular 
direction.    A  fine  structure  probably  due  to  small  g 
anisotropy is observed in completely frozen solution.  The

magnetic  properties 
previously reported [5].  

III. EXPERIMENTAL 

Flat Au(111) surfaces were prepared by flam annealing 
Au thin films grown on to mica substrates. Self assembled 
monolayers  of      NNPhSMe  were  prepared  by  immersing 
Au samples into  1mM solution of the radical dissolved in 

CH2Cl2.  The Au sample was incubated for 16 hours at a 
temperature of 60 oC. The sample was rinsed with ethanol 
several times previous to STM investigation. STM images 
are  taken  by  the  use  of  a  Solver  P47  NT-MDT.  XPS 
spectra were performed to confirm the presence of the S-
Au bond. EPR spectra of the monolayer deposited on Au 
surfaces grown on Si substrate were recorded by a X Band 
Bruker E500. 

IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

XPS  spectra  have  confirmed  the  presence  of  an  S-Au 
bond.  However  the  percentage  of  successful  deposited 
monolayers is low. We ascribe this to the fact that S-CH3 
binds weakly on to Au(111) in comparison to the group S-
H  or -S-S-.  The major  difficulty in modifying the sulfide 
tail  of  the  NNPhSMe  molecule  lies  on  the  fact  that  the 
Nytronil Nitroxide group  is difficult to be synthesized in 
the presence  of  the latter chemical moieties. 

Fig.  2a,  illustrates  an  STM  image  of  the    NNPhSMe 
monolayer. It is possible to recognise a periodic structure 
of bright spots. The size of those spots fits the size of the 
NNPhSMe  molecule  within  the  experimental  error.  Fig. 
2b  shows  a  Fourier  transform  of  the  previous  image. 
Regular structures separated by 5.7 Å in one direction and 
6,3  Å 
the  perpendicular  one  are  present.  This 
superstructure  cannot  be  ascribed  to  Au(111)  surface 
corrugation.    The  smearing  at    the  image    boarder  is 
probably due to vapour condensation.

environment on gold surface is confirmed by EPR. A clear 
hyperfine structure is observed with spectral parameters in 
agreement with those observed in solution spectrum.  This 
confirms  that  EPR  signal  is  not  suppressed  by  the

molecular    motion  compared  to  EPR  timescale.  This  is 
probably  due  to  the  fact  that  the  radical  motion  at  the 
surface  is  dumped  by  the  other  molecules  present  in  its 
surroundings. 

Sample  obtained  by  drop  casting show  the  spectrum V 
presented    in  Fig.  1d.  Relevant  differences  with  respect  
the  spectrum  IV  are    evident.  Hyperfine  components  are 
lost indicating a powder behaviour for the drop cast film.  
This  difference  might  indicate    that  the  NNPhSMe  in  a 
monolayer present a kind of local structural ordering.   

V. APPLICATIONS AND FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS  

SAM of  magnetic radicals as the one presented here can 
be  useful  in  different  directions  of  molecular  electronics 
and  fundamental  magnetism.  We  focus  here  on  three 
examples of  relevance to molecular electronics. 
If    appropriately  diluted  in  to  a  second  non  magnetic 
monolayer  [7]  magnetic  radical  can  be  used  as  isolated 
quantum  “nano”  dots  available  for  Low  Temperature 
STM  spectroscopic  investigation.  If  Coulomb  blockade 
can  be  achieved,  such  a    configuration  surface-magnetic 
molecule-  STM  Tip  can  be  used  for  the  spin-charge 
conversion  in  Quantum  Information  electron  transport 
“read  out”  [8].  Recently  the  first  molecular    Tunneling 
Magneto Resistance (TMR) effect has been observed [9]. 
In this work the authors make use of a alkan thiol SAM as 
tunneling  barrier  separating  two  magnetic  electrodes. 
However,  no  magnetic  functionality  within  the  molecule 
is  exploited.  We  suggest  that  MR  (Magneto-Resistance) 
effect  might  appear  in  sandwiched    devices  of  radicals 
embedded  into  two  non  magnetic  electrodes.  In  fact  the 
application of a magnetic field may orient the radical spins 
along  a  fixed  direction.  Transport  through  the  monolayer 
might be affected by the onset of a magnetic ordering In a 
fashion  similar  to  MR  effects  in  super  paramagnetic 
nanoparticles. 
Finally  as      the  molecular  orbital  allocating  the  spin  is 
known to be delocalized also on the S atom [5], it may be 

possible  that  at  low  temperature  surface  (or  bulk  ) 
electrons  may  couple  to  the  spin  of  the  NNPhSMe.  The 
latter  alongside  with  the  fact  that  the  molecules  are 
spatially positioned in a regular structure may be exploited 
to  observe  Kondo  effect  at  low  temperature  or  even  a 
Kondo lattice behaviour.  Research in this directions may 
innovative 
unveil  both  new  physics  and  prove 
technological paradigm.  

VI. CONCLUSION 

that 

We have successfully deposited SAM of  NNPhSMe on 
to  Au(111).  EPR  spectra  prove 
the  magnetic 
functionality  of  the  radical  is  preserved.  STM  images 
show  that  the  electrical  conductivity  of  the  SAM  is 
sufficient to ensure STM imaging. In order to increase the 
successful  rate  of  the  deposition  process  some  chemical 
modification will be carried on the molecule. A number of 
other  investigations  have  been  being  carried  and  will  be 
published elsewhere.

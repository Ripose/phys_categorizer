Abstract

A new simple Young diagrammatic method for Kronecker products of O(n) and Sp(2m)
is proposed based on representation theory of Brauer algebras. A general procedure for
the decomposition of tensor products of representations for O(n) and Sp(2m) is outlined,
which is similar to that for U(n) known as the Littlewood rules together with trace
contractions from a Brauer algebra and some modiﬁcation rules given by King.

1. Introduction

Representation theory of orthogonal and symplectic groups plays an important role
in many areas of physics and chemistry.
It arises, for example, in the description of
symmetrized orbitals in quantum chemistry[1], fermion many-body theory[2], grand uniﬁ-
cation theories for elementary particles[3], supergravity[4], interacting boson and fermion
dynamical symmetry models for nuclei[5−8], nuclear symplectic models[9−10], and so on.

Reductions of Kronecker products of representations of O(n) and Sp(2m) groups were
outlined in a series of works of King and his collaborators[11−15] based on the pioneering
work of Murnaghan[16], Littlewood[17−18], and Newell[19] on character theory and Schur
functions. A similar approach was then revisited by Koike and Terada[20], in which some
main points were rigorously proved. On the other hand, a Young diagrammatic method
for Kronecker products for Lie groups of B, C, and D types were proposed by Fischer[21].
However, as pointed out by Girardi et al[22−23], rules for the decomposition of tensor
products for SO(n) and Sp(2m) given in [21] are numerous; and some of them are even
ambiguous. After introducing generalized Young tableaux, with negative rows for describ-
ing SO(2m), Girardi et al gave a formula to compute the Kronecker products for SO(n)
and Sp(2m) in [22-23]. The formula can be used to compute both tensor and spinor
representations of SO(n) and Sp(2m). However, no proof was given for their formula.
Littelmann in [24] proposed another Young tableau method to compute Kronecker prod-
uct of some simply connected algebraic groups based on the character theory. The feature
of the method is that it does not use the representation theory of symmetric group. later,
Nakashima proposed a Crystal graph base [25] together with the generalized Young dia-
grams for the same problem. This method applies equally well for the q-analogue of the
universal enveloping algebras of A, B, C, and D types[26].

In addition to the usefulness of these groups in many applications, the decomposition
of the Kronecker products of orthogonal and symplectic groups have long been an in-
teresting problem in mathematics, which was ﬁrst considered by Weyl[27] and Brauer[28].
Besides the works of mentioned above, there are many other similar works. For example,
Berele discussed a similar problem for the symplectic case in [29], and Sundaram for the
orthogonal case in [30].

In this paper, we will outline a new simple Young diagrammatic method for the Kro-
necker products of O(n) and Sp(2m). Our procedure is mainly based on the induced
representation of the Brauer algebra Df (n), which applies to O(n) and Sp(2m) because of
the well-known Brauer-Schur-Weyl duality relation between Df (n) and O(n) or Sp(2m).
This relation has already enabled us to derive Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients and Racah co-
eﬃcients of the quantum group Uq(n) from induction and subduction coeﬃcients of Hecke
algebras[31−32], and Racah coeﬃcients of O(n) and Sp(2m) from subduction coeﬃcients of
Brauer algebra[33].

In Section 2, we will give a brief introduction to Brauer algebras. Induced represen-
tations of the Brauer algebra Sf1 × Sf2 ↑ Df (n) will be discussed in Section 3, which are

2

important for our purpose. In Section 4, we will outline a new simple Young diagram-
matic method for the decomposition of the Kronecker products for O(n) and Sp(2m). A
concluding remark will be given in Section 5.

2. Brauer algebra Df (n)

The Brauer algebra Df (n) is deﬁned algebraically by 2f −2 generators {g1, g2, · · · , gf −1,

e1, e2,

· · · , ef −1} with the following relations

gigi+1gi = gi+1gigi+1,

gigj = gjgi,

|i − j| ≥ 2,

eigi = ei,

eigi−1ei = ei.

eiej = ejei,

|i − j| ≥ 2,

e2
i = nei,

(1a)

(1b)

Using these deﬁning relations and via drawing pictures of link diagrams [34-35], one can
also derive other useful ones. For example,

(gi − 1)2(gi + 1) = 0.

(1c)

It is easy to see that {g1, g2,
· · · , gf −1} generate a subalgebra CSf , which is isomorphic
to the group algebra of the symmetric group; that is, Df (n) ⊃ CSf . The properties of
Df (n) have been discussed by many authors[34−35]. Based on these results, it is known
that Df (n) is semisimple, i. e. it is a direct sum of full matrix algebra over C, when n is
not an integer or is an integer with n ≥ f − 1, otherwise Df (n) is no longer semisimple.
In the following, we assume that the base ﬁeld is C and n is an integer with n ≥ f − 1. In
this case, Df (n) is semisimple, and irreducible representations of Df (n) can be denoted
by a Young diagram with f, f − 2, f − 4,
· · · , 1 or 0 boxes. An irrep of Df (n) with
f − 2k boxes is denoted as [λ]f −2k. The branching rule of Df (n) ↓ Df −1(n) is

[λ]f −2k = ⊕[µ]↔[λ][µ],

(2)

where [µ] runs through all the diagrams obtained by removing or (if [λ] contains less than
f boxes) adding a box to [λ]. Hence, the basis vectors of Df (n) in the standard basis can
be denoted by

matrix elements of gi, and ei with i = 1, 2,
· · · , f − 1 in the standard basis (3) have been
given in [36], and [37]. It is obvious that (3) is identical to the standard basis vectors of
Sf when k = 0. In this case, all matrix elements of ei are zero, while matrix elements of
gi can be obtained by the well-known formula for Sf .

3. Induced representations of Df (n)

From the early work of Brauer [28] and recent studies [34-35] one knows that there is an
important relation, the so-called Brauer-Schur-Weyl duality relation between the Brauer
algebra Df (n) and O(n) or Sp(2m). If G is the orthogonal group O(n) or symplectic group
Sp(2m), the corresponding centralizer algebra Bf (G) are quotients of Brauer’s Df (n) or
Df (−2m), respectively. We also need a special class of Young diagrams, the so-called
n-permissible Young diagrams deﬁned in [31]. A Young diagram [λ] is said to be n-
permissible if Pµ(n) 6= 0 for all subdiagrams [µ] ≤ [λ], where the subdiagrams [µ] can be
obtained from [λ] by taking away appropriate boxes, and P[µ](n) is the dimension of O(n)
or Sp(2m) for the irrep [µ]. A Young diagram [λ] is n-permissible if and only if

(a) Its ﬁrst 2 columns contain at most n boxes for n positive,
(b) It contains at most m columns for n = −2m a negative even integer,
(c) Its ﬁrst 2 rows contain at most 2 − n boxes for n odd and negative.

If these conditions are satisﬁed, Df (n) is isomorphic to Bf (O(n)) for n positive, to
Bf (O(2 − n)) for n negative and odd, and to B(Sp(2m)) for n = −2m < 0.
In the
following, we assume that all irreps to be discussed are n-permissible with n ≤ f − 1
for n > 0 or −n ≤ f − 1 for negative n. These condition imply that the Df (n) being
considered is semisimple.

Therefore, an irrep of Bf (O(n)) or Bf (Sp(2m)) is simultaneously the same irrep of
O(n) or Sp(2m). But the space of B(G) and G are diﬀerent. The former is labelled by its
Brauer algebra indices which is operating among Bf (G) space, while the later is labelled
by its tensor components of group G. This is the so-called Brauer-Schur-Weyl duality
relation between Bf (G) and G, where G = O(n) or Sp(2m).

Hence, in order to discuss the Kronecker products of O(n) and Sp(2m) for general

cases

where {λ1λ2λ} is the number of occurrence of irrep [λ] in the decomposition [λ1]×[λ2], we
can switch to consider induced representations of the Brauer algebra, Sf1 × Sf2 ↑ Df (n)
for the same decomposition given by (4). In this case, we only need to study irreps of
Df (n) induced by irreps of Sf1 × Sf2. The standard basis vectors of [λ1]f1, and [λ2]f2 for
Sf1 and Sf2 can be denoted by |Y [λ1]

numbers 1, 2,
ω } contains k-time trace contractions between
two sets of indices (ω1) and (ω2). For example, in S2 × S1 ↑ D3(n) for the outer product
[2] × [1], there are six elements in {Qk

· · · , f . The other, {Qk≥1

ω} with

{Q0

ω} = {1, g2, g1g2}, {Q1

ω} = {e2, g1e2, e1g2}.

(10)

Let the number of operators in {Qk
ω} be h, and the dimensions of the irreps [λ1]f1 × [λ2]f2
be h[λ1]h[λ2], where h[λi] with i = 1, 2, can be computed, for example, by using Robinson’s
formula for symmetric group Sf . It is obvious that the total dimension including multi-
occurrence of the same irrep in the decomposition (4) is given by hh[λ1]h[λ2]; that is,

hh[λ1]h[λ2] =

{λ1λ2λ} dim([λ]; Df (n)),

where dim([λ]; Df (n)) is the dimension of [λ] for Df (n), which was given in [29]. Hence,
applying the h Qk

pled basis vectors needed in construction of the coupled basis vectors of [λ] for Df (n),
which can be denoted as

where (
all contractions among (ω1) or (ω2) will be zero because [λi] with i = 1, 2, has exact fi
z
boxes, i.e., in this case, the irrep [λi] of Sfi is the same irrep of Dfi(n). Therefore, Sf1 ×Sf2
can also be denoted as Df1(n) × Df2(n) when the irreps [λi] for i = 1, 2, has exactly fi
boxes only. In the following, we will always discuss this situation, and denote Sf1 × Sf2
as Df1(n) × Df2(n) without further explanation.

Finally, basis vectors of [λ]f −2k can be expressed in terms of the uncoupled basis vectors

given by (12).

eﬃcient (ORC).

4. A Young diagrammatic method for Kronecker products
of O(n) and Sp(2m)

Analytical derivation or algorithm for the IDCs discussed in Section 3 is not necessary if
only outer-products of Df1(n)×Df2(n) for irreps [λ1]f1 ×[λ2]f2 are considered. It is obvious
in (12) that irreps with f −2k boxes of Df (n) can be induced from irreps of Df1(n)×Df2(n).
When k = 0, (12) is identical to that for symmetric groups. An important operation in
(12) is performed by {Qk
ω} with k 6= 0. After k-time contraction the uncoupled primitive
basis vector of [λ1]f1 × [λ2]f2 will be equivalent to basis vectors of [λ′
2]f2−k, where
[λ′
i]fi−k with i = 1, 2 is any possible standard Young diagrams with fi − k boxes, which
can be obtained from [λi]fi by deleting k boxes from [λi] in all possible ways. Therefore,
as far as representations are concerned, the irrep {[λ]f −2k} of Df (n) can be obtained from
the outer-product {[λ′
2]f2−k} of the symmetric group Sf1−k × Sf2−k. Thus, we
obtain the following rules for the outer-products of Df1(n) × Df2(n).

can be obtained diagrammatically by

(1) Removing k boxes, where k = 0, 1, 2,
taneously in all possible ways under the following restrictions:

· · · , min(f1, f2), from [λ1]f1 and [λ2]f2 simul-

(a) Always keep the resultant diagrams [λ′

i]fi−k with i = 1, 2 standard Young diagrams;

(b) No more than two boxes in the same column (row) in [λ1] with those in the same row
(column) in [λ2] can be removed simultaneously.

(2) Applying the Littlewood rule of the outer-product reduction for symmetric group to
the outer-product [λ′

2]f2−k, and repeatedly doing so for each k.

1]f1−k × [λ′

What we need to explain is restriction (b). Consider a simple example which is rep-
resentative of the general case. Let [λ1] = [2], [λ2] = [12], and a k-time trace contraction
operator be Qk. According to our procedure, we have

Q1(

×

) = (

α ×

) = (

×

),

(14a)

α

while

Q2(

×

) = ( β α ×

).

(14b)

β
α

Because trace contraction occurs in pairs, the indices α, and β labelled in the boxes
indicate that those with the same indices are contracted with each other. It is known that
trace contraction of two vectors results in the symmetrization of the tensor components.
Therefore, trace contraction of anti-symmetric tensors is zero. However, the indices of α
part is not only symmetric but also anti-symmetric with those of β part in (14b). Hence,
restriction (b) holds.

Finally, using the Brauer-Schur-Weyl duality relation between Df (n) and O(n) or
Sp(2m), one knows that Lemma 1 applies to the decompositions of the Kronecker products
of O(n) or Sp(2m) as well. Thus, we have the following lemma.

Lemma 2. The Kronecker product of O(n) or Sp(2m) for the decomposition given by
(4) can be obtained by using procedures (1) and (2) given by Lemma 1 together with the
following modiﬁcation rules:

· · · , λp,

For the group O(n), where n = 2l or 2l + 1, (Sp(n), where n = 2l), the resulting irrep
˙0] is nonstandard if p > l. In this case, we need to remove boxes
[λ] = [λ1, λ2,
from [λ] along a continuous boundary with hook of length 2p − n (2p − n − 2) and depth
x, where x is counted by starting from the ﬁrst column of [λ] to the right-most column
that the boundary hook reaches.[12] The resultant Young diagram will be admissible or
set to zero if, at any stage, the removal of the required hook leaves an irregular Young
diagram. Then, the resultant irrep [λ]allowed can be denoted symbolically as

= (−)x[σ],

for O(n),

[λ]allowed 


= (−)x+1[σ],

for Sp(2m),

where [σ] is obtained from [λ] by using the above modiﬁcation rules. For example,

which was illustrated in [12] by King. In the following, we give an example to show how
this method works.

Example. Find the Kronecker product [21] × [11] for O(n) or Sp(2m).

First, we consider all possible diagrams with 0, 1, and min(f1, f2) = 2 -time trace
contractions, which are

(16)

Then, we need to compute the Kronecker products [21] × [11], [11] × [1], [2] × [1], and
[1] × [0], which can be obtained by using the Littlewood rule for U(n). We get

[21] × [11] = [32] + [221] + [2111] + [311],

[20] × [1] = [30] + [21],

[11] × [1] = [21] + [111],

[1] × [0] = [1].

Finally, summing up all the irreps appearing on the rhs. of (17), we obtain

[21] × [11] = [32] + [221] + [2111] + [311] + [30] + 2[21] + [111] + [10],

(18)

which is valid for O(n) when n ≥ 8 and Sp(2m) when m ≥ 4. Using the modiﬁcation
rules given in Lemma 2, we can easily obtain the following results

[210] × [110] = [320] + [221] + [211] + [311] + [300] + 2[210] + [111] + [100] for O(7), (19a)

5. Concluding Remarks

In this paper, a new simple Young diagrammatic method for the decomposition of the
Kronecker products of O(n) and Sp(2m) is outlined based on the induced representation
theory of Df (n). This algebra was proposed by Brauer at the end of thirties. His aim
was indeed to solve the decomposition problem of the Kronecker products of O(n) and
Sp(2m). On the other hand, because the representations of Df (n) are the same as those
of Birman-Wenzl algebras Cf (r, q) when r, and q are not a root of unity, the method

(20a)

(20b)

(20c)

(22a)

(22b)

applies to quantum groups Oq(n) and Spq(2m) as well for q being not a root of unity.
The induced representations of Df (n) presented in Section 3 can also be used to derive
Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients of SO(n) when IDCs of Df1(n) × Df2(n) are evaluated, which
will be discussed in our next paper.

It should be stated that though our Young diagrammatic method for decomposition
of O(n) and Sp(2m) Kronecker products is derived from induced representation theory
of Brauer algebra with the help of Brauer-Schur-Weyl duality relation, the ﬁnal results
are the same as those derived by Littlewood and Newell based on character theory and
Schur functions[18−19]. In[18], the main results on how to obtain the Kronecker product of
O(n) and Sp(2m) were achieved through the combinatorials of certain type of S-functions.
However, in [18], only p ≥ r cases were considered, where n = 2p or 2p + 1 for O(n),
and p = m for Sp(2m), and r is the number of rows for the corresponding irrep. In this
case, no modiﬁcation rule is needed, which is the same as ours. When p ≤ r in a Young
diagram, the ﬁnal diagram with number of rows greater than p will become non-standard
irrep, the correspondence between these non-standard diagrams and the corresponding
standard ones with signs in the front of the diagrams was ﬁrst studied by Newell in [19],
which gives just the so-called modiﬁcation rules proposed by King in a much simper
manner.[12] This fact is now summarized by Lemma 2 in this paper.

On the other hand, the Young tableau method proposed by Littelmann [24] and crystal
graph base given in [25] are related to the weight space of the corresponding Lie groups
(algebras). Therefore, these methods do not use the representation theory of symmetric
groups at all. But the ﬁnal results on the decomposition of the Kronecker product of
O(n) and Sp(2m) are the same as those obtained by our Young diagrammatic method
derived from Brauer algebras.

Furthermore, this method can also be applied to the Kronecker products of SO(2l + 1)
If k = l, the
for any irreps and SO(2l) for their irreps [λ1, λ2,
· · · , λk] with λk 6= 0 reduces into irreps of SO(2l) denoted by
irrep of O(2l) [λ1, λ2,
· · · , − λk], of which the dimensions are the same. In this
[λ1, λ2,
case, one should be cautious and use this method. The dimension formula for SO(n) is

Finally, it should be noted that the method applies to tensor or “true” representations
of O(n) only. The spinor representations of O(n) are related to spinor representations of
Brauer algebras according to the Brauer-Schur-Weyl duality relation, which still need to
be further studied.

Summary 

 
The  fine  structure  of  histograms  of  measurements  of  239Pu  alpha-activity  varies 
periodically, and the period of these variations is equal to sidereal day (1436 minutes). The 
periodicity  is  not  observed  in  the  experiments  with  collimator  that  restricts  the  alpha 
particles flow to be oriented to the Polar Star. Based on this study and other independent 
data,  such  as  measurements  conducted  by  the  Arctic  expedition,  and  similarity  of  the 
histograms  in  processes  observed  at  different  locations  at  the  same  local  time,  the 
conclusion  was  made,  that  the  fine  structure  of  statistical  distributions  of  the  observed 
processes depends on the celestial sphere. 
 

Introduction 

During  many  years,  we  explore  changes  in  the  fine  structure  of  the  histograms  for 
consequent measurements of parameters of various physical processes. We call such changes as 
“macroscopic fluctuations” (MF). (Udaltsova, N.V. et all. 1987;  Shnoll S.E. et all.1992, 1998, 
2000; Fedorov M.V. et all.2003).  

Comparing  various  physical  processes  (from  measurements  of  noise  in  gravitation-
gradient  antenna  and  rates  of  biochemical  reactions,  to  radioactive  decay  measurements) 
observed at different geographic locations at the same local (longitudinal) time, we have found 
the following:  

1.  Shapes of histograms in such different processes are similar at the same local time 

with high likelihood ( Shnoll S.E.2001). 

2. The shape of histograms varies regularly in time. Here are some observations:  

a.  The  histograms  of  the  adjacent  time  intervals  are  similar  with  highest 

likelihood: this is the "neighbor zone effect".

b. For different locations similar histograms are observed most likely at the same 
local time: this fact indicates that histogram shape depends on the rotation of the Earth 
around its axis. 

c.  The  recurrence  of  the  similar  shape  of  the  histogram  is  observed  with  the 

period 1436 minutes, i.e. sidereal day. 

These effects can be explained by the fact that, while the Earth is rotating around its axis 
and moves at the same time around the Sun, different sections of the Earth's surface are exposed 
to different sectors of the celestial sphere (Shnoll S.E.,  2001; Fedorov et all. 2003).  

The assumption that the shape of histograms depends on the celestial sphere "above the 
place of measurements", leads to the next ones: “the neighbour zone effect" and the about-daily 
variations of the histogram shape disappear at the geographical poles.  

This  hypothesis  was  confirmed  in  the  study  of  239Pu  alpha-activity  during  the  Arctic 
expedition  at  the  Arctic  Ocean.  This  expedition  took  place  in  August  –  October,  2000;  the 
measurements  were  conducted  at  82  degree  of  the  North  latitude,  aboard  the  ship  "The 
Academician Fedorov" ( Shnoll S.E.et all., 2003).  

Additional confirmations of this assumption were obtained in the study of collimators restricting 
alpha  particle  flow  in  certain  directions.  The  results  of  these  experiments  are  presented  in  this 
article.  

Objects and methods 

 

The  most  convenient  object  for  the  MF  studies  is  the  process  of  radioactive  decay, 
especially alpha decay. Alpha decay is definitely immune to any trivial factors. It is possible to 
register separate acts of radioactive decay as a “binary” phenomenon (in logic of 0, 1). 

This possibility was exercised in the specially constructed sensitive devices designed by 
one  of  the  authors  (I.A.R.).  These  devices  provide  transformation  of  the  registered  alpha 
activity  data  into  time-series  datasets  with  absent  low-frequency  trends.  The  results  of  the 
measurements according to all criteria correspond to "white noise" with Poisson distribution. 

We  used  two  identical  devices  for alpha-radioactivity  measurements  of  239Pu  samples. 
Both  devices  provided  rigid  fixation  of  the  source  position  in  respect  to  the  detector.  The 
collimator  (which  “cuts  out”  a  jet  of  alpha  particles  in  a  specified  direction)  may  be  placed 
between the source and the detector. One of the devices had the collimator oriented toward the 
Polar  Star.  The  other  device  in  one  case  had  no  collimator  and  the  detector  registering  alpha 
particles emitting from the entire surface of the source which was West-oriented, in other case it 
had the collimator oriented to the West. 

The distance between the source and the detector was 12 mm for both devices. While 
flying this distance, alpha particles lose about 10% of their energy. As the result, the energy of 
particles  reaching  the  detector  was  ~  4  MeV.  The  registration  threshold  was  ~  1,6  MeV;  it 
completely  excluded  any  possible  influence  of  detector  noise  as  well  as  humidity  and  air 
density variations. 

A  crystal  generator  (131  MHz  frequency)  was  used  for  measuring  time  intervals.  The 
power voltage of the converter was stabilized. The instability of the registration threshold was 
about ± 6% for the temperature range from minus 300 C to plus 500 C. 
 

Fig.  1  shows  the  histogram  constructed  for  60  of  the  results  of  consecutive  measurements  of 
alpha-activity of the 239Pu sample. The duration of 1 measurement is 1 second. X-axis represents

the  measured  parameter  (in  this  case,  the  number  of  registered  events  of  alpha  decay).  Y-axis 
shows the number of measurements in respect to the observed level of activity.  

Fig. 1 
A. Non-smoothed “inconsistent” histogram, 60 measurements.  
B. The same histogram, after single smoothing. 
C. The same histogram smoothed 15 times. 

As shown the actual value of the ordinate is quite small, not more than 4. The number of classes 
(in  this  case,  it  is  60)  used  for  constructing  these  histograms  is  compatible  to  the  number  of 
measurements (in this case, it is also 60). As a result the original histogram is pockmarked. Such 
histograms are called "inconsistent". It is hard to find any regularity in change of shape in such 
histograms.  However,  things  alter  when  we  smooth  these  insufficient  histograms  using  the 
method of moving averages. Look at Fig. 1-B; it is the same histogram after single smoothing. 
The result of 15 times smoothing is shown at Fig. 1-C. It is evident that, as a result of smoothing, 
the specific shape becomes visible. In the following discussion we consider just these histograms

Fig. 2 represents a number of non-smoothed inconsistent histograms constructed for the first 25 
sections  of  time-series  results  of    alpha-activity  measurements  in    the  239Pu  sample.  (these 
sections  are  not  overlapping).  Each  section  covers  60  measurements  within  1  minute  in  total. 
One couldn’t find evident regularities for these distributions.  

Fig.3. The same histograms as at Fig. 2 smoothed 15 times. Axes are the same as at 

Fig. 2. 
Fig. 3 represents the same histograms as at Fig. 2, after 15 times smoothing. The similar form of 
some histograms becomes evident. Is such a similarity accidental? To answer this question, we 
have to compare thousands of possible combinations of histogram pairs. 

 

For this purpose, we used the computer program "Histogram Manager" (HM) designed by Edwin 
Pozharsky  (Shnoll  S.E.  et  all.  1998a).  This  program  provides  construction  of  histograms,  their 
smoothing, imposition upon each other, some linear transformations, as well as the accumulation 
of the records of all selected similar pairs in a special file. The main function of this program is 
the  calculation  and  construction  of  the  frequency  distribution  of  selected  similar  histograms 
against time-intervals between them. Nevertheless an expert performs the most important part of 
the analysis - the diagnosis “similar – not similar”.  

The comparison of many thousands of histogram pairs is a job extremely time and labor 
consuming.  There  have  been  many  attempts  to  replace  an  expert  with  an  adequate  computer 
program, but all the attempts failed. The various methods were used - from regular calculations 
of correlation coefficients, statistical criteria estimation, to application of neural networks and 
Wavelet-analysis.  The  results  of  application  of  all  these  methods  are  still  inferior  to  a  visual 
estimation.  

Some efforts were made to eliminate the bias in the diagnostic process. The program HM 
does this through the randomization of histogram numbers. In this case, the expert is blinded to 
the histogram numbers; so the distribution of the time-intervals between the similar histograms 
obtained by the expert may not be biased. 

The main purpose of the study was investigation of the association between the realization of 
similar histograms and the value of time interval between them. Based on the results of 
histogram comparison, we construct the distribution of a number of similar pairs in respect to 
the length of the interval between them.

Many thousands of histogram pairs were compared to get the reliable distributions for 

similar pairs of histograms in respect to time intervals. 

The estimation of statistical significance of maximums of these distributions was based 
on  hypergeometric  distribution  (Pearson  E.S.  et  all.  1958.)  As  shown  in  the  work  cited 
(N.V.Udaltsova  see  in:  Shnoll  S.E.  et  all.  2004),  the  Poisson  distribution  may  be  used  as  a 
general, broader estimation of the significance. We will utilize this method for conclusions that 
have a fundamental value.  

Results 

From January 31 through July 11, 2002, and from February 19 through December 2003, 
ten sets of round-o-clock measurements of 239Pu alpha-activity were conducted at the Institute of 
Theoretical  and  Experimental  Biophysics,  RAN  (RUSSIAN  ACADEMY  OF  SCIENCE), 
Pushchino  (latitude:  540  50’  North;  longitude:  370  38’  East).  Measurements  were  taken  every 
second  using  two  independent  identical  devices.  One  of  the  devices  was  equipped  with  the 
collimator  oriented  toward  the  Pole  Star,  the  other  one  was  either  equipped  with  a  collimator 
oriented to the West, or without collimator with detector and a radioactive sample plate oriented 
to  the  West.  Each  set  of  measurements  continued  about  one  month.  The  results  of  one-second 
measurements  were  summarized  into  one-minute  rates.  Every  60  one-minute  numbers  were 
combined into a histogram, so each histogram was built on one-hour interval of time-series. As a 
result we “replaced” a set of radioactive decay measurements by a set of consecutive one-hour 
histograms.  After  that  we  made  a  one-by-one  comparison  of  smoothed  histogram  shapes  and 
constructed a frequency chart of similar histograms against the time interval between them.  

The results of experiments of 2002 – 2003 are presented in the table 1 and at the  fig 4. In the 
Table  1  counts  of  similar  histograms  are  presented  against  the  time  interval  between  them. 
Measurements were conducted with no collimator (February 17, 2002 – July 11, 2002), and with 
collimator oriented to the West (February 19, 2003 – December 2, 2003).

Let us look at the results of the first column of measurements (17 FEB 2002) in detail. There 
were selected 118 pairs of similar histograms related to the interval of 1 hour. For the interval of 
2 hours, there were only 65 similar pairs. It is the "neighbour zone effect": the adjacent 
histograms have the highest chance to be similar. While the interval between histograms 
increases, the number of similar pairs decreases. However, at 24 hours, this number jumps high 
(to 91 pair of similar histograms).  
Altogether, for the first cell, 697 histogram pairs with the interval of one hour were compared, 
that included experimental data obtained for almost a month (698 hours, ~ 29 days). The overall 
number of histogram pairs compared for the first column (as well as for each other column) was 
over 18000; a total count of selected similar histograms was 1360 (the lower line of the Table 1), 
i.e., about 7% of number of compared pairs.  

Estimation of statistical significance based on hyper-geometric distribution gives the probability 
of  random  realization  of  the  "neighbour  zone  effect"  (interval  1  hour)  for  the  first  column  as 
p<10-9.  For  the  interval  of  24  hours,  it  is  p<  10-8.  The  general  estimation  based  on  Poisson 
distribution shows that these two maximums far exceed 99% upper confidence limit. 

The total number of pair comparisons of histograms in all ten sets of measurements in the Table 
1 was approximately 180,000. The total counts of similar histograms for each time interval are 
shown  in  the  last  “Total”  column  and  at  the  Fig.4.  890  similar  pairs  correspond  to  the  first 
interval (p<10-8). The count of similar histograms significantly decreases for larger intervals (to 
390-430) and then it rises sharply for the interval of 24 hours (to 957, p<10-8). The probability 
that these effects are random is extremely small.

 Table  2  and  Fig.  5  represent  counts  of  similar  histograms  for  experiments  with  the  collimator

"neighbour zone effect", nor daily periodicity.

Fig.5.  Counts  of  similar  60-minute  histograms  regarding  the  time  interval  between  them 
for measurements of alpha-activity 239Pu with collimator oriented to the Polar Star. Axes as 
at the Fig. 4. 

As  we  see  at  given  figures,  a  chance  of  repeated  appearance  of  the  same  shape  of 
histogram is essentially different in measurements with the collimator oriented to the Polar Star 
and  measurements  without  collimator  or  when  collimator  oriented  to  the  West.  In  the 
measurements without collimator, or with the collimator oriented to the west, the obvious effect 
of “neighbor zone” is observed, as well as about-24-hour period. In the measurements with the 
collimator oriented toward the Polar Star a likelihood of repeated appearance of the same shape 
of histogram is about the same along time – there is neither “neighbor zone”, nor about-daily 
periodicity. Estimation of probability to obtain such differences in total distributions gives very 
small values.

About-daily  periodicity  in  appearance  of  the  same  shape  of  histogram  in  the 
measurements without collimator, or when collimator oriented to the West, is equal exactly to 
1436 minutes, i.e. sidereal day. This period was observed in one-minute histograms constructed 
for 60 one-second measurements. In these experiments we compared several sets of one-minute 
histograms.  We  considered  pairs  with  intervals  of  1434  to  1442  minutes  between  histograms. 
Each set had 698 histograms. In each experiment, for each column of Table 3, 6282 histogram 
pairs  have  been  compared,  and  a  count  of  similar  histograms  for  each  time  interval  has  been 
written  into  corresponding  cell.  The  average  proportion  of  similar  histograms  was  about  5%. 
The frequency of appearance of similar histograms at the interval of 1436 minutes is more then 
2  times  higher  then  average  frequency  for  other  intervals.  Estimated  probability  of  random 
appearance of such effect is less then 10-6.  

Table 3.  Comparison of one-minute histograms of 239Pu alpha-activity: 24-hour period in 
histogram shape resemblance is equal 1436 minutes, i.e. sidereal day.

Conclusions 

The  results  exclude  any  trivial  explanation.  False  effects  are  excluded  not  only  by  strict 
following to the principle of “equality of other conditions”( ceteris paribus principle) – the only 
difference between “case” and “control” is direction of alpha particles registered in experiments. 
It  is  absolutely  impossible  to  affect  the  radioactive  decay  itself.  It  is  paradoxical  that  in 
experiments conducted on 54о North latitude with collimator oriented toward the Polar Star the 
shapes  of  histograms  vary  in  time  by  the  same  way  as  histograms  received  for  measurements 
near the North Pole (Shnoll S.E., 2003). 

It may indicate that probability of flow of alpha particles is not the same for different directions, 
and  variations  of  this  probability  in  time  depend  on  changes  in  the  surrounding  time-space 
continuum. The presence of clear periodicity in these changes with the sidereal period of 1436 
minutes (Shnoll S.E., 2001), the higher frequency of the appearance of similar histograms at the 
same local (longitudinal) time, the disappearance of daily periodicity near the North Polar, and, 
finally, presented above results of the experiments with collimators, - all these facts suggest the 
dependence of the observed effects on the state of the celestial sphere. The registration of such 
dependence  is  not  sufficient  for  declaring  a  hypothesis,  which  might  explain  its  "mechanism". 
However,  in  this  article  our  task  is  only  to  register  the  significance  of  these  astonishing 
phenomena.

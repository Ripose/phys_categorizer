ABSTRACT

A  hierarchical  approach  to  the  construction  of  compound  distributions  for  process-induced  faults  in  IC
manufacture  is  proposed.  Within  this  framework,  the  negative  binomial  distribution  is  treated  as  level-1  models.  The
hierarchical approach to fault distribution offers an integrated picture of how fault density varies from region to region
within  a  wafer,  from  wafer  to  wafer  within  a  batch,  and  so  on.  A  theory  of  compound-distribution  hierarchies  is
developed by means of generating functions. A study of correlations, which naturally appears in microelectronics due to
the batch character of IC manufacture, is proposed. Taking these correlations into account is of significant importance for
developing procedures for statistical quality control in IC manufacture. With respect to applications, hierarchies of yield
means and yield probability-density functions are considered.

1.  INTRODUCTION

As early as in 1964, Murphy [1] introduced the compound Poisson distribution into microelectronics, having found
that the traditional Poisson distribution is not always adequate to predict yield in integrated-circuit (IC) manufacture. The
point is that process-induced faults tend to occur unevenly over the wafer, appearing as clusters. Murphy's approach was
developed by Seeds [2], Okabe et al. [3], Stapper [4, 5], and other researchers.

The  compound  Poisson  distribution  differs  from  the  traditional  one  in  that  the  parameter  λ   denoting  the  fault

density is regarded as a random variable. Experience indicates that the gamma distribution is probably the most accurate

model for  λ [6--10]. Also note that the compound Poisson distribution is a limiting case of the compound binomial

distribution, the latter arising within Polya's urn model [11-12].

Statistical  yield  models  based  on  compound  distributions  have  proven  to  be  useful  in  design,  manufacture,  and
product  evaluation  alike.  Yield  enhancement  aims  to  make  the  product  fault-tolerant  (i.e.,  less  sensitive  to  process-
induced faults) by adding a degree of redundancy to the IC (error-correcting codes are an example) and by optimizing its
floorplan and layout [13--18]. Concerning the manufacture phase, we cite the Bayesian approach. Applied to in-process
product control, the method allows one to refine yield prediction and make decisions as the batches progress along the
processing line [19]. Compound-distribution models also help one to calculate yield distribution over wafers, to estimate
costs, to evaluate manufacturing efficiency, to predict yield losses, etc. [20, 21].

In this paper, we describe a hierarchical approach to the construction of compound distributions for process-induced

faults in IC manufacture.

Section  2  describes  the  origin  and  main  properties  of  a  yield  model  that  is  built  around  the  compound  Poisson

distribution and has been accepted by the electronics industry [17].

Section 3 develops a theory of compound-distribution hierarchies. Within this framework, the Poisson distribution
and the negative binomial distribution belong to level 0 and 1. It is shown that main formulae can be written in compact
analytical form by means of generating functions.

Section 4 deals with applied aspects. Compared with previous results, a more general formalism for mean yields is
presented. Also included are equations for yield probability densities. The yield is thus treated as a hierarchical random
variable.

2.  COMPOUND POISSON DISTRIBUTION

Primitive yield models employ the binomial distribution. Consider a chip with  n components. If each of them has
 that

the same probability  p of being faulty and faults arise independently of one another, then the probability 
the chip has exactly  k faulty components is

Since  n is  very  large  and  p is  very  small,  the  binomial  distribution  can  be  approximated  by  a  Poisson
distribution  to  a  good  accuracy.  Accordingly,  with  λ   denoting  np (the  expected  value  of  k ),  the  probability

Assume that the chips have no redundancy, so that any faulty component will make the chip nonconforming.

Then, the yield  Y  is equal to the probability that a randomly chosen chip is fault-free:

However, it was found as early as in 1964 that Eq. (3) makes badly pessimistic predictions if applied to large-
area chips [1]. The underlying reason, as was revealed later, is that process-induced faults do not arise independently in
different regions of the wafer but tend to cluster.

To allow for fault clustering, the compound Poisson distribution was introduced, in which the expected number

Let us recast this in terms of the average number of faulty components per chip, 

=0λ

The model considered is known as the large-area clustering negative binomial model [13, 15]. The parameter
a  is called the cluster parameter. Its typical values approximately range from 0.3 to 7. In actual fact, fault clustering
disappears if a  exceeds 4 or 5; for such a , Eq. (17) can be approximated by formula (3).

The large-area clustering model is based on two assumptions. First, fault clusters are larger than chips, so that

any faulty chip is totally covered by one fault cluster. Second, faults are distributed uniformly within any cluster.
In  addition,  there  are  the  small-area  clustering  negative  binomial  model  [24]  and  the  medium-area  clustering  negative
binomial model [25, 26]. The latter is regarded as including the other models [13]. It is intended for chips with areas on
the order of a square inch; they may well be larger than fault clusters. Since the concept of fault cluster has yet to be
clarified, the medium-area clustering model is defined in terms of blocks [25]. It is assumed that (i) correlation between
faults may exist only within a block, (ii) blocks are statistically independent of each other, (iii) the total number of faults
per block obeys a negative binomial distribution, and (iv) faults are distributed uniformly over each block.

3 COMPOUND-DISTRIBUTION HIERARCHIES

3.1 Generating-Function Hierarchy for a Compound Poisson Disiribution

specified by a single parameter, 

Let  us  describe  the  multilevel  clustering  fault  hierarchy.  At  level  0,  we  have  a  binomial  distribution.  It  is
0p , which might be viewed as the proportion of faulty components. In passing to level
0p  by the compounding

0p  a random variable with a beta distribution and eliminate 

1, we declare the parameter 

procedure. As a result, we deal with parameters  1a  and  1b  instead of 

0p . Finally, we introduce clustering factor

In  general,  level 

1+r

  is  constructed  from  level  r   by  treating  the  parameter 

obeying the beta distribution with parameters

variance. The expansion of 

2σ  in terms of hierarchy levels might be useful for estimating 

ig  from empirical data.

Concerning IC manufacture, formulae (32) and (33) make it possible to develop the hierarchical analysis of variance for
process-induced faults by analogy with that for product variables [27].

3.3 Correlation Characteristics in Multilevel Clustering Fault Model

Let us assume that the clustering factor 

1g  describes the nonuniformity of the fault level from cluster to cluster

(block) on a wafer; 

2g , from wafer to wafer within a batch; 

3g , from batch to batch etc.

From  clustering  nature  of  fault  formation  it  follows  that  the  numbers  of  these  faults  in  closely  spaced  regions
should  correlate  between  each other stronger  than  in  more  distant  ones.  Such  correlations  can  be described  by  the  so-
called interclass correlation coefficient introduced by Ronald Fisher for genetics problems.

Let  us  consider  the  stream  of  independent  batches  corresponding  to  the  three  level  model.  The  interclass

correlation coefficient reaches its peak for regions within a cluster (block):

As  the  complexity  n   of  a  region  under  control  increases,  this  correlation  coefficient  tends  to  unity  (the

(34)

corresponding difference from unity is caused by the Poisson fluctuations in the number of faults). If the regions under
control belong to different clusters within the same wafer, the correlation coefficient is:

The difference  in  these  regions  resulting  in  decreasing  correlation  compared  to  unity  is  caused  not  only  by  the
Poisson fluctuations but also by the nonuniformity of the fault level from cluster to cluster within a wafer. Finally, the
correlation coefficient for regions located on different wafers within a batch is equal to

multilevel hierarchical clustering models describe well the results of numerical Monte Carlo simulations and real data.

4. YIELD ANALYSIS

4.1 Yield Hierarchy

In  the  absence  of  redundancy  the  yield  is  measured  by  the  probability  of  choosing  a  fault-free  chip

);  therefore,  it  is  simply  equal  to  the  value  of  the  generating  function  at 

0=k
(
.  Thus,  for  chips  of
complexity  n ,  the  generating-function  hierarchy  can  easily  be  associated  with  a  yield  hierarchy.  With

We have developed a general approach to the construction of compound distributions for process-induced faults
in IC manufacture. It quantifies the performance of a process in hierarchical form and helps one build general statistical
models  for  fault  control  and  yield  management.  With  the  aid  of  generating  functions,  main  results  can  be  written  in
compact analytical form. The strategy covers the negative binomial distribution regarding it as level-1 models.

The hierarchical approach to fault distribution offers an integrated picture of how fault density varies from area
to area within a wafer, from wafer to wafer within a batch, and so on. The average fault density and the clustering factor
can be estimated from an expansion of the variance in terms of hierarchy levels.

Yield  hierarchies  provide  a  new,  general  formalism  for  yield  estimation  and  prediction  in  IC  manufacture,
treating  the  yield  as  a  random  variable.  Particular  cases  are  the  Poisson  distribution  (level-0  model)  and  the  negative
binomial distribution (level-1 model).

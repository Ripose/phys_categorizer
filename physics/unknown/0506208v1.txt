Studies indicate that pre-existing misconceptions negatively impact the effectiveness of 

traditional physics education.  Research has also shown that activity based instruction 

improves posttest scores on conceptual evaluations.  However, the specific effect of 

activity based instruction on students who have pre-existing misconceptions that lecture 

instruction fails to remove is an important but unanswered question due to the 

impossibility of instructing a given student by two different methods.  In this paper pre 

and posttest Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation results are characterized in terms 

of wrong to same wrong, wrong to different wrong, wrong to right, etc., and a method of 

inferring the effect of activity based instruction on a lecture student using the right to 

wrong responses is presented.  Results indicate that a wrong to same wrong response by a 

lecture student would be more likely to be converted to a wrong to right by activity based 

instruction than would be a wrong to different wrong response.  This result is consistent 

with cognitive conflict as an aid to learning in activity based classes.

I. INTRODUCTION 

About twenty five years ago researchers began to develop conceptual test 

instruments to evaluate student understanding of force and motion.1  As a result of this 

development several evaluation instruments have emerged.2-5  Two of the more 

commonly used instruments are the Force Concept Inventory6 (FCI) and the Force and 

Motion Conceptual Evaluation7 (FMCE).  Both the FCI and FMCE underwent similar, 

lengthy, and rigorous development.  In the first stage of this development short answer 

responses to carefully written conceptual questions, and the results of student interviews, 

were used to identify many of the student misconceptions associated with a particular 

question.  In the second stage of development these misconceptions were used as the 

basis for writing “distracters” for multiple choice questions.  Thus the presence of an 

identical wrong answer by a student on a pre and posttest is an indicator of a pre-existing 

and persistent misconception.8   

The physics education research community began to systematically study general 

student use of misconception based distracters about fifteen years ago.9-14  In 1995, 

Thornton15 introduced the term “Conceptual Dynamics” to refer to the phenomenological 

study of student concepts as a function of time.  In Thornton’s method the student 

responses to multiple choice FMCE questions are mapped into categories called “student 

views” that are associated with particular beliefs about the relationship between force and 

motion.  Thornton monitored the change in the frequencies describing the use of these 

views over the course of instruction.  More recently, Bao and Redish16 have introduced a 

method called “Model Analysis” that is also based on a predetermined set of student 

Reiser and Markes - 4 

models.  As in Thornton’s analysis the models imply certain beliefs about force and 

motion on the part of the students.  Bao and Redish have applied their method to analyze 

pre and posttest responses obtain from both the FCI and FMCE.17 

Thornton’s Conceptual Dynamics and Bao and Redish’s Model Analysis both 

involve the application of a predetermined set of models.  However, there is one 

significant aspect of the student’s test response that can be addressed without 

constructing a set of student models:  That is, whether or not the student’s incorrect 

posttest response is the same or different from the pretest response.  In this paper a study 

is made of the consistent wrong responses from pre to posttest using the FMCE.  For the 

purpose of this study wrong to same wrong responses will be referred to as “persistent 

misconceptions”.  In addition, it has been found possible using this type of 

characterization to make statistical inferences concerning how activity based instruction 

might have modified a traditional lecture student’s posttest responses.  Both the FMCE 

test results and an analysis of the data will be presented in this paper.   

The paper is arranged as follows:  In Section II the instruction methods and data 

parameters are presented.  In Section III the results of FMCE testing are presented, and in 

Section IV the details of the analysis are presented.  The paper concludes in Section V 

with a summary and conclusions.

II. INSTRUCTION METHODS AND EVALUATION 

A.  Instruction Methods 

This study involves two instructors and six sections of algebra level introductory 

physics (one section of each class type each fall semester from 1995 to 1997) at the 

University of Nebraska-Kearney.  Three of these sections employed a 

Lecture/Demonstration Based (LB) format and were taught by the first instructor.  The 

other three sections employed an Activity Based (AB) format and were taught by the 

other instructor.  Both instructors had over 20 years of teaching experience at the time the 

data were collected, and both are highly respected teachers who receive excellent student 

evaluations.  (Neither of the authors was directly involved with the instruction.)  The LB 

sections met three 50-minute periods plus one 75-minute period per week with one three-

hour laboratory each week.  The AB sections met three 110-minute periods plus one 75-

minute period per week with an integrated laboratory.  Both types of class had a total of 

6.75 contact hours per week.  There were 87 LB students and 64 AB students.  The mean 

number of LB students per section was 29, and the mean number of AB students per 

section was 21.   

In the LB sections the instruction was via lecture/demonstration, and the LB 

sections had a required college physics textbook.18  Problems were assigned from this 

textbook.  The AB sections were based on about 15 to 20 minutes of lecture instruction 

per 110-minute session with the remainder of the time used by the students, working in 

groups, to complete sections of a workbook or do experiments.  At the time of data 

collection the AB sections primarily utilized the Calculator Based Laboratory (CBL) 

technology developed by Texas Instruments.  The CBL technology was essentially a TI-

 

Reiser and Markes - 6 

85 calculator, various “probes”, and the CBL interface box that connected the calculator 

to the probes.  The activity workbook was written by the instructor who at the time was 

the principle investigator on a FIPSE grant19 to integrate activity based methods with the 

CBL technology.  The activity book suggested readings from the textbook.  However, it 

was primarily a stand-alone, guided inquiry workbook organized into activity units 

focused on particular topics.  The workbook was influenced to some extent by early 

versions of Workshop Physics.20  However, it was principally an independent work based 

on the experience of the principle investigator and general findings of the physics 

education research community.  Another primary function of the workbook was to 

facilitate the integration of the CBL technology into the course.  Sample copies of current 

versions of some activities are available online.21  The textbook used in the LB sections 

was also required for the AB sections, but end-of-semester surveys indicated that the 

students made little use of the text.   

 
B.  Evaluation 

Pre and posttesting was done using an early version of the Force and Motion 

Conceptual Evaluation22 (FMCE).  The primary difference between the newer version 

and the version used in this study is that the newer version has more distracters for some 

of the questions.  A total of 87 lecture based students and 64 activity based students were 

tested.  The FMCE has 43 multiple choice questions of which 42 were analyzed.23  

Pretesting was done on both classes sometime during the first two weeks of instruction, 

and posttesting was done near the end of the semester after all topics on the FMCE had 

been covered in both classes.   

Reiser and Markes - 7 

 

 

 

 

 

For data recording each student was considered to be a primary sampling unit 

chosen at random from large hypothetical populations of LB and AB students.  Each 

student  i  for class type  k  (

k =  for LB instruction, 

0

1k =  for AB instruction) was 

associated with the 42 questions of the FMCE, and the number of pretest wrong

When both the pretest and the posttest are considered, there are two possible outcomes 

for pretest right questions, right to right ( rr ) and right to wrong ( rw ).  For pretest wrong 

questions there are three possible outcomes:  wrong to same wrong ( ww ), wrong to 

different wrong ( ww¢ ), and wrong to right ( wr ).  Each student  i  is associated with five 

random variables

, which are the total 

numbers of outcomes (frequencies) in the five response categories for student  i .   

For the purpose of comparing the numbers of persistent misconceptions (the  ww  

responses) only the pretest wrong questions are of interest.  However, different students 

have different numbers of pretest wrong responses, and this must be considered in the 

analysis.  In order to take this variation into account the three possible pretest wrong 

outcomes ( ww ,  ww¢ ,  wr ) are used to calculate three random variables per student

where  r = rw  or  rr , and the mean probabilities per student are again given by Eq. (4) 

One complication that must be considered in the analysis is that the quantities  x  

are ratios of random variables instead of simple random variables.  However, Hansen et. 

al.24 have shown that ratios of random variables can be consider to be simple random 

variables under three conditions:  (1) the sample is a simple random sample of elementary 

units; (2) the denominator is the number of units in a specific class of the sample; and (3) 

the numerator is an aggregate value for some characteristic of the units enumerated in the 

denominator.  In this analysis the quantities  x  satisfy these requirements and will be 

considered to be simple random variables.

III. FMCE RESULTS 

Figure 1 shows a histogram of the number of pretest wrong responses per student 

grouped in four bins:  0-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39.  The picket heights were 

determined by first counting the total number of pretest wrongs for each student and then 

placing the student into the appropriate bin.  The bin values were then normalized by 

dividing by the total number of students in each class type (LB or AB).  Thus, to 

determine the total number of LB students who had between 0 and 24 wrong answers on 

the pretest one would multiply the bin’s value (0.08 for this bin) by the number of LB 

students (87), or  0.08 87 7

= .  The numbers of students in the other bins are calculated 

in an analogous way.   

From Fig. 1 it can be seen that the bin with the largest number of students for both 

types of class is the 30-34 bin.  The number of LB students in this bin is  0.60 87 = 52

 

and the number of AB students in this bin is 0.66 64 = 42

.  It can be noted that there is 

on average a fairly good match between the fractions of students in each bin.  A chi-

square test for independence yielded 

0.20

 which weakly suggests there may be a 

p =

minor dependence on class type.  This could be due to either the different class types 

attracting slightly different groups of students or to the time at which the pretest was 

administered.  The LB sections typically had the pretest given the second week of 

instruction, and the AB sections had it typically given the first week of instruction.  It 

should be noted, however, that a slight dissimilarity between the two student groups 

should not significantly influence the analysis results because all reported  x  values are a 

result of normalization against either the total number of pretest right or pretest wrong 

·

questions for each student.  In general, the overall pretest results are very consistent with 

the findings of other researchers who have found that very predictably an average student 

will miss about 75 percent of the questions on the pretest.25   

Figure 2 shows the mean probabilities  wwx

, 

'wwx

,  wrx , 

rrx , and 

rwx  for the LB and 

AB sections.  For  ww ,  ww¢ , and  wr  these are the sample based mean probabilities that a 

pretest wrong question will be answered same wrong, different wrong, or right 

respectively on the posttest.  For  rw  and  rr  these are the sample based mean 

probabilities that a pretest right question will be answered wrong or right respectively on 

the posttest.  The error bars are set at plus or minus one standard deviation.  It can be seen 

that the most significant differences are found in the wrong to same wrong ( ww ) and the 

wrong to right ( wr ) categories with AB instruction significantly reducing the probability 

of a  ww  response and significantly increasing the probability of  wr  response.  The 

wrong to different wrong response ( ww¢ ) and the pretest right responses ( rw , rr ) are 

affected less significantly.

IV. ANALYSIS 

The analysis is based on the concept of taking a large hypothetical population of 

N  students through the operations shown schematically in Fig. 3.  The actual students 

participating in the study are assumed to be random samples taken from this population 

after posttesting.  These samples are indicated by small boxes within the Population 0 and 

Population 1 boxes.   

As shown in Fig. 3 the students are first pretested and then given LB instruction 

followed by posttesting.  The students after LB instruction and posttesting are labeled 

Population 0.  Mean probabilities 

 for the populations can be defined in analogy with

where  r = ww ,  ww¢ ,  wr ,  rw , or  rr .  In this and the following section sample based 

quantities will be indicated using lower case Roman symbols and population based 

quantities will be indicated by upper case Roman symbols.  After the posttest the entire 

population of  N  students is hypothetically assumed to be returned to their preinstruction 

state, reinstructed using AB methods, and posttested a second time and relabeled 

Population 1.  Since the reinitialization is assumed to remove all memory of the LB 

instruction, the AB students tested in practice can be considered as a random sample 

taken from Population 1.  Further, if  N  is much larger than the sample sizes, sampling 

with replacement can be assumed even though, in practice, LB students cannot appear in 

the AB sample.

Equations (8) and (9) imply that the effect of reinitialization and reinstruction of 

the lecture students by activity based methods can be represented by transfers of 

probability  A ,  B ,  C , and  D  as shown in Fig. 4.  The transfers resulting from a 

hypothetical reinstruction using activity based methods can be expressed as 

Given  A ,  B ,  C , and  D  the effect of a hypothetical reinstruction of the population of  N  

lecture based students is determined.  However, without additional information, Eqs. (11) 

and (12) cannot be solved for  A ,  B , and  C  because there are more unknowns than 

independent equations.   

A solution is made possible by an additional assumption that relates the values  C  

and  D .  Recent interviews26 of students who answered right to wrong on certain FMCE

and  

Reiser and Markes - 13 

questions have indicated that they generally could not state specifically why they were 

able to answer a question correctly on the pretest and yet failed to answer it correctly on 

the posttest.  A typical response was that the pretest answer must have been a “lucky 

guess”.  Another possibility, although none of the interviewed students mentioned it, is 

that the pretest right response might have been obtained in spite of faulty physical 

understanding.  An examination of the FMCE reveals that this is possible for at least 

some of the questions.27  Given that the pretest right response was fortuitous, or made in 

spite of a faulty physical model, right to wrong responses are essentially equivalent to 

wrong to different wrong responses, and there must be some relationship between  C

In practice only sample based quantities are available while Eqs. (10) – (12) 

and (15) refer to populations.    However, sample based values can be used to estimate 

population based values to within a certain estimated confidence interval determined 

from the standard deviation of the sample, and standard deviations can be calculated for 

products, quotients, and sums given the standard deviations of the factors or terms.  The 

expressions for the standard deviation of products, quotients, and sums of sample mean 

values are derived in the Appendix.  The probability transfer  C  is estimated as

V. SUMMARY AND CONCULSIONS 

This paper has presented a method, based on sampling theory, that infers the 

effect that activity based instruction would have on traditional lecture students were it 

possible to return them to their initial knowledge state and reinstruct them using activity 

based methods.  This is done by categorizing responses on FMCE pre and posttests as 

wrong to same wrong ( ww ), wrong to different wrong ( ww¢ ), wrong to right ( wr ), right 

to wrong ( rw ), or right to right ( rr ).  In addition, two assumptions are made:  the first 

assumption (based on student interviews) is that the  ww¢  response is equivalent to the  rw  

response, and the second assumption is that the transition probabilities 

,f r r ¢  (the 

probability that an LB question in the  r  response category will be transformed to the  r ¢  

category by hypothetical AB reinstruction) vanish for directions opposite the arrows in 

Fig. 4.  The central theoretical object of the analysis is a single large hypothetical 

population of  N  students that is initially instructed using traditional lecture methods.  

The lecture students actually participating in the study are assumed to be a random 

sample taken from this population which is labeled Population 0.  After posttesting 

Population 0 is assumed to be returned to its preinstruction state and reinstructed using 

activity based methods.  After reinstruction and posttesting a second time, the population 

is labeled Population 1.  The activity based students actually participating in the study are 

assumed to be a random sample taken from Population 1.   

The primary quantities of interest are the mean transition probabilities 

,f r r ¢  with 

r  and  r ¢  =  ww ,  ww¢ , or  wr .  The assumed equivalence of the  ww¢  and  wr  responses 

is used to justify the assumption 

f

 which allows all mean transition 

=

f

ww wr
,

rw rr
,

¢
Reiser and Markes - 18 

 

f

 

probabilities to be calculated.  It is found that 

f

,ww wr

 and 

f

,ww wr

 are resolved at one 

standard deviation with the estimated value of 

f

 about twice the estimated value of 

,ww wr

f

,ww wr

.  The transition probability 

f

¢  is not completely resolved from 

f

,ww ww

.  

,ww wr

However, 

f

¢  is very small, and the estimated value of 

f

 is about five times as 

,ww ww

,ww wr

large as the estimated value of 

f

¢ .  Generally, the results suggest that 

,ww ww

>

f

>

f

ww wr
,

ww wr
,

ww ww
,

 with 

f

,ww ww

¢  significantly smaller than either 

f

 or 

f

,ww wr

,ww wr

.   

The practical impossibility of returning lecture students to their initial condition 

demands a discussion of some underlying cognitive theory in which this kind of analysis 

would be plausible.  For an example of a cognitive theory under which this analysis 

would NOT be plausible, consider the point of view that students are essentially “blank 

slates” where learning is a “recording” process acting on the slate.  In this case the 

analysis presented in this paper is not plausible because reinitialization erases all the 

slates and all questions become equivalent.  However, it is likely that learning is at least 

partly a constructive process that makes use of a student’s pre-existing knowledge.  From 

the constructivist28,29 point of view the results presented in this paper suggest that a 

lecture student who answers wrong to same wrong on a particular question has a working 

model that can be applied to that question, and hence also has many of the primitive 

cognitive building blocks30 (diSessa’s “p-prims”) from which an expert physical model 

can be constructed.  It then follows that activity based instruction is effective at 

stimulating those students to use these mental elements to construct expert knowledge, 

and it supports the idea that cognitive conflict is a viable and beneficial aspect of an 

activity based classroom.

8  It has been pointed out by diSessa and others (See Ref. 28.) that the common concept of 

a physical "misconception" is naive and does not explain how the primitive elements in 

even a misconception can, at least in some cases, provide the building blocks of expert 

knowledge.  This paper does not attempt to explain how misconceptions might play a 

 

Reiser and Markes - 23 

role in the construction of expert knowledge.  It only presents inferences about how 

students might respond deduced from a certain phenomenological model.

26  In the spring of 2004, 21 activity based students who had right to wrong responses on 

the pretest posttest sequence of the FMCE were interviewed following the posttest.  

Some common responses were: “lucky guess the first time”, “thought too much about it 

the second time”, “became confused the second time”, and “cannot remember”.   

27  This is often given as a reason why multiple choice evaluations alone are inadequate.

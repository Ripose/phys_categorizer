ABSTRACT 

The  methodology  for  obtaining  two-  and  three-dimensional  magnetic  resonance 

images  by  using  azimuthally  symmetric  dipolar  magnetic  fields  from  ferromagnetic 

spheres  is  described.  We  utilize  the  symmetric  property  of  a  geometric  sphere  in  the 

presence of a large externally applied magnetic field to demonstrate that a complete two- 

or three-dimensional structured rendering of a sample can be obtained without the motion 

of  the  sample  relative  to  the  sphere.  Sequential  positioning  of  the  integrated  sample-

sphere  system  in  an  external  magnetic  field  at  various  angular  orientations  provides  all 

the 

required 

imaging  slices 

for  successful  computerized 

tomographic 

image 

reconstruction.  The  elimination  of  the  requirement  to  scan  the  sample  relative  to  the 

ferromagnetic  tip  in  this  imaging  protocol  is  a  potentially  valuable  simplification 

compared to previous scanning probe magnetic resonance imaging proposals.

There  has  been  a  steady  advance  in  the  field  of  Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging 

(MRI)  towards  higher  resolution,  with  the  ultimate  goal  of  atomic  imaging  capability. 

The  largest  measurement  challenges  stem  from  weak  signals  typical  of  high-resolution 

magnetic  resonance  [1],  and  the  limitation  of  available  gradient  field  strengths  from 

current  carrying  conductors.  Following  the  original  reports  [2-4]  of  applying  magnetic 

field gradients to samples in order to demonstrate magnetic resonance imaging of spatial 

spin distribution, improvements in conventional inductive detection [5,6] have resulted in 

spatial  imaging  resolution  of  approximately  1µm  [7-10].  The  attraction  and  intense 

research  interest  towards  3D  MRI  with  higher  resolution  is  driven  by  the  well-known 

advantages of MRI as a three-dimensional, non-invasive, multi-contrast, and chemically 

specific imaging tool [11,12]. 

The  introduction  of  ferromagnetic  nanostructures  for  increased  sensitivity  and 

resolution  in  magnetic  resonance  imaging  has  opened  additional  avenues  toward 

achieving  the  atomic  resolution  goal.  Scaling  considerations  show  that  a  miniaturized 

permanent  magnet  will produce  higher fields than an electromagnet, and can be further 

scaled  to  a  smaller  size  without  any  loss  in  field  strength  [13].  Miniaturization  of 

permanent  magnets  also  provides  an  increase  in  the  magnetic  field  gradients  while 

requiring  no  electrical  power  supply  and  no  current  leads.  Finally,  permanent  magnets 

generate  no  heat  and  thus  require  no  heat  dissipation.  This  ability  of  nanometer  scale 

ferromagnets  to  provide  ultra-high  magnetic  field  gradients  that  can  in  turn  spatially 

resolve  resonant  spins  on  the  atomic  scale  has  led  Sidles  to  propose  the  Magnetic 

Resonance Force Microscope (MRFM) [14]. In this instrument, a microscopic magnetic 

particle  on  a  mechanical  cantilever  acts  as  a  source  of  atomic  scale  imaging  gradient 

 

2

fields as well as a force generator on the spins whose magnetic resonance the mechanical 

cantilever  detects  [15].  Magnetic  resonance  image  can  be  obtained  by  mechanically 

scanning the tip in three dimensions over the sample. 

In this article, we focus on the magnetic resonance imaging protocol that uses the 

interaction  between  a  sample  and  the  stray  fields  from  a  geometrically  symmetric 

ferromagnetic  sphere.  We  demonstrate  that  a  two-  or  three-dimensional  imaging  of  a 

sample  can  be  obtained  without  the  motion  of  the  sample  relative  to  the  sphere.  We 

believe that the use of such a sphere model is reasonable, as microscopic ferromagnetic 

spheres  of  high  quality  and  shape  uniformity  have  been  successfully  fabricated, 

manipulated, and integrated on sensors [16-19]. Our protocol is similar to the Stray Field 

Magnetic  Resonance  Imaging  (STRAFI)  technique  [20]  where  constant  magnetic  field 

gradients,  on  the  order  of  60T/m,  from  superconducting  magnets  are  used.  Here, 

however,  the  nanometer  scale  ferromagnetic  spheres  can  provide  ultra-high  magnetic 

field gradients (~5x106T/m for a 100nm diameter Cobalt sphere), that can in principle be 

utilized  for  three-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  imaging  with  resolution  reaching 

Angstrom levels. 

We  describe  a  two-dimensional  imaging  protocol  first,  before  expanding  this 

principle  to  the  full  three-dimensional  method.  Our  model  configuration  is  shown  in 

Figure  1a,  where  a  sample  with  size  of  ~1/10  the  size  of  the  ferromagnetic  sphere  is 

positioned as shown. The sample can represent a biological cell ~10µm in size next to a 

sphere  100µm  in  diameter,  or  at  the  extreme,  a  small  molecule  or  protein  of  ~10nm  in 

size next to a 100nm diameter ferromagnetic sphere. A large DC magnetic field B0 (~10 

Tesla) is applied parallel to the z-direction, polarizing the spins of the sample as well as 

 

3

saturating  the magnetization of  the ferromagnetic sphere. A small radio frequency field 

B1 is applied perpendicular to the large polarizing DC magnetic field B0. In the absence 

of the ferromagnetic sphere, the nuclear spins in the sample would experience the same 

externally  applied  field  B0  and  therefore  meet  the  magnetic  resonance  condition  at  the 

same  magnetic  resonance  frequency  ωR.  However,  close  to  the  ferromagnetic  sphere,  a 

large magnetic field gradient is present at the sample, and only certain spins of the sample 

satisfy  the  correct  magnetic  resonance  condition  at  any  given  magnetic  field  and 

The magnetic field from the ferromagnetic sphere at point r in the sample has the 

frequency:

where n is the unit vector that points from the center of the ferromagnetic sphere to the 

sample location, and m is the magnetic moment vector of the sphere. Since the external 

DC polarizing magnetic field B0 is considered to be much larger than the field from the 

ferromagnetic sphere, only the z-component of the magnetic field from the ferromagnetic 

sphere, BZ, needs to be considered [21-23] for imaging. For a ferromagnetic sphere, this 

z-component of the magnetic field has the azimuthally symmetric form:

where  θ  is  the  angle  between  the  z-axis  and  the  distance  vector  r,  and  M0  is  the

also  shows  the  contours  of  constant  values  for  the  z-component  of  the  magnetic  field 

from the sphere, BZ, along the x-z plane. 

 

In  contrast  to  the  previous  approaches  [21-23],  we  propose  to  fix  the  sample 

directly on the sphere, as shown in Figure 1(a), at an angular location where:

At this angular orientation of θ=54.7˚, BZ≈0, and the contours of constant z-component of 

the  magnetic  field  BZ  from  the  ferromagnetic  sphere  are  perpendicular  to  the  sphere 

surface, so that the sample is intersected by approximately perpendicular imaging slices. 

In  Figure  1(b),  the  contours  of  constant  z-component  of  the  magnetic  field  from  the 

ferromagnetic sphere are shown along the plane parallel to the two-dimensional sample 

surface. This view shows that the magnetic resonance spectrum of the two-dimensional 

sample (i.e., the configuration shown in Figure 1) will be a one-dimensional projection of 

the  sample  spin  density.  This  leads  to  the  possibility  of  obtaining  a  computerized 

tomographic  image  [24-27]  if  multiple  imaging  slices  from  the  dipolar  field  of  the 

ferromagnetic sphere can be obtained at different angles, as we describe below. 

The imaging slices at multiple angles required for the computerized tomographic 

image  reconstruction  process  can  be  obtained  from  a  configuration  of  Figure  1  without 

the  motion  of  the  sample  relative  to  the  sphere.  We  come  to  this  conclusion  by 

considering what happens when the integrated sample/sphere system is jointly rotated by 

an angle φ around the θ=54.7˚ axis, as shown in Figure 1. Although both the sample and 

the  sphere  are  mechanically  rotated  by  the  same  angle  φ,  the  presence  of  a  large 

polarizing  magnetic  field  B0  of  ~10  Tesla  along  the  z-axis  ensures  that  the  saturated 

 

5

magnetic  moment  of  the  ferromagnetic  sphere  remains  oriented  along  the  z-axis.  As  a 

result,  the  imaging  contours  of  constant  z-component  of  the  magnetic  field,  BZ,  remain 

fixed in space. Therefore, rotating the fixed sample/sphere system at a uniform sequence 

of  angles  φ  provides  all  of  the  required  imaging  slices  for  previously  developed  two-

dimensional computerized tomography reconstruction algorithms [24-27].  

We note that, depending on the instrumental constraints or preferences, the actual 

rotation  of  the  integrated  ferromagnetic-sphere/sample  system  shown  in  Figure  1  could 

also be experimentally executed by multiple sequential rotations around the x and y axes, 

as shown in Figure 2. As rotations do not commute, such sequential rotations around x- 

and y-axes would have to be carefully selected. For example, the rotation of the sample 

around θY and then around θX, shown in Figure 2a, would result in the correct translation 

and rotation of the sample for proper tomographic slicing, while a single rotation around 

the  z-axis,  shown  in  Figure  2b,  would  result  in  the  correct  translation  but  incorrect 

rotation of the sample for proper slicing by the contours of constant BZ. Additionally, we 

restrict  our  sample  size  to  a  fraction  of  the  ferromagnetic  sphere  dimension  in  order  to 

maintain the slicing of the sample by approximately parallel contours of constant BZ. We 

note  that  image  reconstruction  from  non-parallel  slices  has  been  demonstrated  in 

computerized tomography [26] and is mathematically justified [28,29]. 

In  order  to  extend  our  methodology  to  the  three-dimensional  imaging  case,  we 

find it advantageous to represent the integrated sphere/sample system rotations (described 

in  Figures  1  and  2)  in  a  precessing  ferromagnetic  sphere  moment  reference  frame,  as 

shown  in  Figure  3.  In  this  perspective,  although  much  harder  to  implement 

experimentally  for  a  B0=10  Tesla  magnetic  field,  the  same  effect  of  image  slicing  as 

 

6

described in Figures 1 and 2 can be employed. In this reference frame, the sample is fixed 

and located on top of the sphere, as shown in Figure 3, while the ferromagnetic moment 

of the sphere is tilted away from the z-axis by θ=54.7˚ and precessed around the z-axis at 

a sequence of angles φ required for the tomographic image reconstruction process. 

We  now  analyze  the  case  of  a  three-dimensional  sample  mounted  on  a 

ferromagnetic sphere, as shown in Figure 4. At the angular position of θ=54.7˚, as in the 

two-dimensional  imaging  case,  the  sample  is  intersected  by  the  planes  of  constant  z 

component  of  the  magnetic  field  from  the  ferromagnetic  sphere  that  are  approximately 

perpendicular  to  the  sphere  surface.  Consider  now  the  rotation  of  the  integrated 

sample/sphere system so that the angle φ=0 is held fixed while the angle θ is sequentially 

reduced in value from θ=54.7˚ to θ=0. This results in the sequential slicing of the three-

dimensional  sample  by  the  imaging  planes  that  range  from  being  approximately 

perpendicular to the sphere surface to being approximately parallel to the sphere surface, 

as  Figure  4(a)  shows.  Therefore,  by  rotating  the  sample/sphere  system  through  several 

angular  values  that  range  from  θ=54.7˚  to  θ=0,  all  the  required  imaging  slices  are 

obtained for two-dimensional image reconstruction along the x-z plane where angle φ=0. 

This protocol again relies on the principle that, although both the sample and the sphere 

are mechanically rotated by the angle θ, the large polarizing magnetic field along the z-

axis  ensures  that  the  saturated  magnetic  moment  of  the  ferromagnetic  sphere  remains 

oriented along the z-axis and the imaging contours remain fixed in space.  

A three-dimensional imaging protocol follows directly from these principles as all 

of  the  slices  needed  for  three-dimensional  image  reconstruction  can  be  obtained  by 

varying both angles φ and θ, as described in the precessing ferromagnetic sphere moment 

 

7

reference  frame  of  Figure  4(b).  By  sequentially  varying  the  angles  (θ,  φ)  of  the 

ferromagnetic moment direction through all possible angular combinations from θ=54.7˚ 

to θ=0˚ and φ=0˚ to φ=360˚, as shown in Figure 4(b), the sample will be intersected by 

imaging slices at all possible angular orientations. This is sufficient for a complete three-

dimensional  image  reconstruction,  although  several  points  of  interest  need  to  be 

addressed regarding the image-reconstruction process.  

It  is  apparent  from  Figure  4(a)  that  the  planes  of  constant  z-component  of  the 

dipolar magnetic field BZ from the ferromagnetic sphere are curved, non-parallel, and not 

equally  spaced.  This  is  not  prohibitive  for  the  image reconstruction procedure,  as basic 

back-projection algorithms [24-27] can be used for obtaining a three-dimensional image 

of  the  sample.  More  specifically,  for  an  angular  orientation  (θ,  φ),  a  weighted  value  is 

assigned  to  each  contour  of  constant  z-component  of  the  magnetic  field  BZ  from  the 

magnetic resonance spectrum obtained at that angular orientation. The three-dimensional 

image  reconstruction  of  the  sample  is  then  completed  by  repeating  the  weighted  value 

assignment  procedure  for  all  angular  orientations  (θ,  φ).  Although  this  procedure  is 

sufficient  for  basic  three-dimensional  image  reconstruction,  this  simple  back-projection 

algorithm is known to produce star-like image artifacts, and is therefore not optimal. The 

less  artifact-prone  but  more  complicated  filtered  back-projection  algorithms  or, 

alternatively,  the  matrix-based  iterative-reconstruction  algorithms  could  be  employed 

[26]. 

A  second  point  of  interest  is  the  image  resolution.  It  is  apparent  from  the 

inspection of the contours of constant z-component of the magnetic field in Figure 4(a) 

that the image resolution depends on the distance from the ferromagnetic sphere surface. 

 

8

Only two magnetic field gradient forms are of interest since there is no variation of the 

azimuthally symmetric contours of the constant z-component of the magnetic field with 

the change of angle φ. The variation of the imaging contours along the radial direction is 

described  by  Equation  4,  and  the  gradient  of  the  imaging  contours  along  the  angular  θ 

direction is:

Both gradients have an inverse radial dependence to the fourth power, which means that 

parts of the sample closer to the sphere will experience higher magnetic field gradients 

and  therefore  can  in  principle  be  imaged  with  a  higher  resolution.  This  can  also  be 

deduced from Figure 4(a). Strong dependence of the gradient fields on r in Equations 4 

and 5 also explains why the use of the nanoscale ferromagnetic spheres is advantageous 

in potentially obtaining atomic resolution images from projections.  

It is important to point out that in our imaging method it is not required to know a 

priori  where  the  sample  is  located  on  the  ferromagnetic  sphere.  If  the  ferromagnetic 

moment  direction  is  sequentially  varied  through  the  angles  (θ,  φ)  from  θ=0˚  to  θ=180˚ 

and φ=0˚ to φ=360˚, the sample will be intersected by the imaging slices at all possible 

angular  orientations,  and  a  three-dimensional  image  reconstruction  through  back-

projection  algorithms  will  reveal  an  image  and  the  location  of  the  sample  on  the 

ferromagnetic sphere. 

In  addition  to  understanding  the  imaging  methodology  and  resolution,  it  is 

important to discuss the choice of experimental methods for sample/sphere positioning as 

well  as  magnetic  resonance  detection.  Our  protocol  involves  angular  motion  of  the 

 

9

sample/sphere system around two rotational axes. Such sample positioning technology is 

well  developed  and  is  routinely  used  in  the  STRAFI  technique  [20].  The  sensitivity 

requirements depend on the desired resolution. In addition to the conventional inductive 

detection,  we  also  suggest  that  optical  detection  methods  [30-32],  micro-coils  [33,34], 

superconducting  quantum  interference  devices  (SQUID)  [35,36],  Hall  sensors  [37,38], 

and superconducting resonators [39] remain viable candidates to be implemented in this 

imaging  method.  In  addition,  cantilever  detection  could  be  employed  through  direct 

transfer of angular momentum [40-43] and energy [44-46] to the spin population in the 

magnetic resonance process. As compared to the scanning probe type cantilever detection 

[15], in our protocol the need for scanning the sample with respect to the ferromagnetic 

probe  is  eliminated,  along  with  the  potential  problems  of  long  term  positioning  drift 

between  the  sample  and  the  ferromagnetic  gradient  source.  It  is  also  important  to  note 

that, with the elimination of the relative motion of the sphere with respect to the sample, 

the thermo-mechanical vibrations of the cantilever do not translate into relative thermal 

motion  and  therefore  fluctuations  of  the  magnetic  fields  and  field  gradients  from  the 

sphere  at  the  sample  location.  The  intrinsic  thermal  motion  of  the  magnetic  moment 

remains, however, and has to be carefully considered in the ferromagnetic sphere material 

selection [47].  

We  have  described  a  technique  for  magnetic  resonance  tomography  using  the 

dipolar  magnetic  fields  from  ferromagnetic  spheres  distinctly  different  from  previous 

magnetic  resonance scanning probe  microscopy approaches that seek to achieve atomic 

imaging resolution. In previous experimental schemes, the images are obtained by raster 

scanning a ferromagnetic probe over the sample in three dimensions, and de-convolving 

 

10

intensities  from  the  obtained  magnetic  resonance  spectra  at  each  point  [48,49].  In 

contrast,  in  the  dipolar  field  magnetic  resonance  tomography  scheme  described  in  this 

article, the ferromagnetic sphere and the sample are fixed with respect to one another. We 

rely on the geometric symmetry of the sphere and on the principle that the ferromagnetic 

moment  remains  saturated  and  oriented  along  a  large  polarizing  magnetic  field  despite 

the mechanical motion of the sphere. Angular positioning of the integrated sample/sphere 

system then provides all the required imaging slices for computerized tomographic image 

reconstruction.  The  elimination  of  the  requirement  of  scanning  the  sample  relative  to  a 

ferromagnetic  tip  in  this  new  imaging  protocol  could  represent  a  valuable  experimental 

simplification  and  bring  us  closer  to  the  goal  of  atomic  resolution  in  three-dimensional 

nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.

Fig.  1.  (a)  Model  configuration  for  two-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  tomography 

using ferromagnetic spheres. Imaging contours of constant z-component of the magnetic 

field  are  perpendicular  to  the  sphere  surface  and  intersect  the  sample  positioned  at 

θ=54.7˚. (b) The imaging contours shown along the plane parallel to the two-dimensional 

sample  surface.  The  magnetic  resonance  spectrum  of  the  sample  is  a  one-dimensional 

projection  of  the  sample  spin  density.  Sequential  rotations  by  angle  φ  provide  the 

required projections for the tomographic image reconstruction process. 

Fig. 2. (a) Alternative procedure for proper image slicing by sequential rotations around 

the  y-  and  x-axes.  (b)  A  single  rotation  around  the  z-axis  would  result  in  an  incorrect 

rotation of the sample for proper slicing by the magnetic field imaging contours. 

Fig.  3.  Precessing  ferromagnetic  sphere  moment  reference  frame.  The  sample  is  fixed 

and located on top of the sphere while the magnetic moment of the sphere is tilted away 

from the z-axis by θ=54.7˚ and precesses around the z-axis at a sequence of angles φ. 

Fig. 4. (a) Rotation of the integrated sample/sphere system from θ=54.7˚ to θ=0 results in 

the sequential slicing of the three-dimensional sample by the imaging planes that range 

from  being  approximately  perpendicular  to  the  sphere  surface  to  being  approximately 

parallel to the sphere surface. (b) The precessing magnetic moment reference frame for 

the  three-dimensional  tomography.  By  sequentially  varying  of  the  angles  (θ,  φ)  of  the 

sphere  magnetic  moment  direction  through  all  angular  combinations  from  θ=54.7˚  to 

θ=0˚ and φ=0˚ to φ=360˚, the sample is intersected by the imaging slices at all possible 

angular orientations.

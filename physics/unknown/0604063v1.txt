Abstract. The purpose of present paper is to develop the approach to calculation of the mass
spectra  of  elementary  particles  within  the  framework  of  the  resonance  theory  of  elementary
particles as de Broglie waves

1.0. Introduction.

1.1. Equivalence of energy and mass spectra

As  is  known  neither  classical,  nor  quantum  theories  could  explain  the  nature  of  masses  of

elementary particles and could deduce the numerical values of masses till now.

The  basic  experimental  facts  here  are  the  following:  1)  masses  of  elementary  particles  make
the discrete spectra; 2) according to modern representations, all elementary particles are the exited
states of a small set of some particles, which represent the lowest level of a spectrum of masses.

It  is  supposed  that  discreteness  of  spectrum  of  masses  of  elementary  particles  is  similar  to  a
discrete spectrum of excitation energies of atom. According to the formula 
, where  e  is
the particle energy,  m is  the  rest  mass  of  particle  and  c   is  the  light  velocity,  to  any  rest  mass
corresponds the stationary level of energy.

1.2. Energy spectra of electron in hydrogen atom as an example of a spectrum of masses

The first calculation of energy-mass spectrum of electron in hydrogen atom has been based on
the known Bohr atom theory, in which the quantization was entered by a separate postulate. This
approach allows the calculation of energy spectrum of electron, but it does not reveal the reasons
of quantization.

The reasons of  quantization have been specified by de  Broglie,  who  showed  that  elementary
particles in a stationary state can be considered as standing waves, which formation conditions are
the conditions of the length waves’ integrality.

Below we will consider in more detail the analysis of electron motion in hydrogen atom from

the point of view of the de Broglie theory.

1.2.2. Quantization of the electron energy in hydrogen atom according to de  Broglie

In  his  dissertation  de  Broglie  has  shown  (Broglie,  de,  1924;  1925;.  Andrade  e  Silva  and
Loshak,  1972),  that  the  orbits  postulated  by  Bohr  for  electron  motion  around  a  hydrogen  atom
nucleus can be received from the condition that the length of an orbit  L  should contain an integer
number of electron wavelengths 

  (see fig. 1):

constant (usual and bar), u is the particle velocity,  
c  of    fig.1  this  condition  is  carried  out,  when  n  =  2,  4  and  8,  accordingly.  In  case  of  d  this
condition  is  not  carried  out    and  electron  motion  is  unstable,  that  leads  to  self-destruction  of  a
wave as a result of an wave interference. Mathematically the  integrality condition corresponds to
the requirement of  unambiguity of wave function.

ump =

A similar condition also takes place for elliptic orbits (see also (Shpolski, 1951)), but this case
is more complex, since the length of de Broglie wave in different points of an elliptic orbit varies
because the electron speed is not constant. In this case it is necessary to use the general condition
of quantization:

where   ds is the orbit length element,  T  is the period of motion,  dt  - time element,

Thus,  calculation  of  electron  energy  levels  in  hydrogen  atom  from  the  wave  theory  point  of
view needs to be considered as calculation of resonance conditions of de Broglie electronic wave
in the potential well (resonator) formed by an electromagnetic field of a nucleus.

From  the  above-stated  follows  that  the  stationarity  conditions  correspond  to  resonance

conditions, which are adequate to conditions integrality of the standing waves.

Such  sight  at  the  reason  of  occurrence  of  quantum  levels  of  electron  energy  also  allows  to
calculate the last in other similar cases. For example, as an approximate model of 3-dimensional
short-range  potential,  can  be  the  spherical  potential  well  of  some  radius  R  (Naumov,  1984).
According to de Broglie for the big circle of sphere of radius R, we will have:

From here, we receive for energy levels: 

.  As  we  marked  above  (see  chapter  9),

the exact solution of this and other problems the Helmholtz equation for de  Broglie waves gives,
(on  the  other  hand,  the  Schreudinger  wave  equation);  this  result  differs  from  the  approximate
result only by the constant 

2p .

We  will  note  one  remarkable  feature,  which  has  the  solution  of  Schreudinger  equation  for
electron in a potential well of final depth. The solution shows (Matveev, 1989; Shiff, 1959), that
in this case there is a final number of own levels of energy. Whether it is possible to distribute this
conclusion to elementary particles (specifically to the leptons family), remains in doubt.

Attempts of calculation of mass-energy spectra on the basis of resonance behaviour of particles

exist for a long time. We will briefly mention the most consecutive of them.

2.0. Present calculations of elementary particle masses

The  existing  calculations  are  based  on  assumptions  and  guesses,  which  cannot  be  proved

enough within the framework of the quantum field theory.

2.1. Quasi-classical approaches to mass calculation

According to them the basic particle assimilates to a potential well (or, that is the same, to the
resonator  of  the  certain  configuration).  The  spectrum  of  masses  of  particles  arises,  when  some
additional  resonance  particle  (e.g.  photon)  is  placed  in  this  potential  well.  Characteristics  of
addition particle change the characteristics (mass, spin, charge, etc) of the basic particle and we
can consider the last one as new particle.

One of the first attempts of quasi-classical calculation (for masses of  muon and pion) belongs
to Putilov (Putilov, 1964). Note that this calculation does not take into account the experimental

(cid:242)
(cid:242)
-
facts,  which  have  been  found  out  later  (e.g.,  the  existence  of  a  tau-lepton,  the  law  of  lepton
number  conservation,  etc.)  and  it  should  be  considered  only  as  an  example  of  a  corresponding
computational procedure.

A second, much more detailed calculation (for the big number of particles, known at that time)
is  stated  in  paper  (Kenny,  1974).  Here  is  already  the  theoretical  substantiation  of  a  method  of
calculation and are received impressing results. But calculation is made by analogy to the theory
of  Bohr;  as  a  result  here  was  used  Coulomb  potential  well.  The  obtained  numerical  values  of
masses,  without  serious  substantiation,  are  corresponded  with  masses  of  known  particles  that
conduct to infringement of laws of conservation of quantum numbers, etc.

Another approach is based on the  quantization rules of  Bohr-Wilson-Sommerfeld. The group
of scientists J.L.Ratis, F.A.Garejev and others (Ratis and Garejev, 1992; Garejev, Kazacha, Ratis,
1996; Garejev, Kazacha, Barabanov, 1998; etc) has achieved especially impressive results, using
the  new  quantization  condition  for  asymptotic  momenta  of  decay  products  of  the  hadronic
resonances.

2.2. Quantum approaches to mass calculation

The calculations, based on idea of  composite  particles,  take place here. We will show below

that this approach has near connection to the resonance theory.

As it is marked in the A.  Rivero and A.  Gsponer's review (Rivero and Gsponer, 2005) one of
the first possible approaches to an estimation of masses of elementary particles was based on the
known composite model of  Nambu-Barut (Nambu, 1952; Barut,  1979).  In  particular,  for  leptons

Barut  has  received  the  following  formula:

In this approach it is postulated that for calculation of masses of heavy leptons to the rest mass

Recently, a similar expression had been received from other reasons. In paper (Rodriguez and
Vases, 1998) for  muon  mass  as  exited  state  of  electron  (which  is  allocated  with  properties  of  a

quark) the  formula is  received:  m

Other  successful  empirical  formula  is  I.  Koide's  formula.  As  authors  (Rivero and  Gsponer,
2005)  in  the  review  write:  "on  the  end  of  year1981  I.  Koide,  working  above  some  composite
model of quarks, has had fortunate or unfortunate case to run into very simple correlation among

Below we will show that there is a successive approach, which doesn’t contradict to quantum
field  theory,  that  allows  to  obtain  strictly  enough  the  formulas,  close  to  the  formulas  of  A.O.
Barut, K.A Putilov., W.A Rodrigues.- J. Vaz, and also to confirm the calculation formula of  Yu.
L. Ratic –F.A. Gareev-et all group. (In the framework of this analysis about I. Koide formula we
cannot say anything).

3.0. Statement of problems of calculation of masses of particles

According  to  the  wave  theory  the  elementary  particles  must  be  formed  as  wave  stable
formations.  Hence,  their  characteristics  (in  this  case,  energy-mass  of  particles)  should  be
calculated, proceeding from laws of the wave theory.

We suppose (Kyriakos, 2006) that
1) 

all particles are divided into two groups: a) absolutely stable: electron, neutrino, proton
and their antiparticles; and  b) metastable: all other particles.
the  metastable  elementary  particles  are  the  composite  (compound)  particles,  appearing
as superposition of an absolutely stable particle and some additive particles.
the  metastability  of  compound  particles  is  ensured  by  resonance  conditions  and  by
corresponding conservation laws.

2) 

3) 

transition of electron 

As  a  simplest  reaction  of  formation  of  a  compound  particle  it  is  possible  to  consider  the
-e  in an atom from a low level to higher level of energy:

be  is the base electron energy,  

where 
ne  is any electron energy level,  g  is  the photon
(gamma-quantum),  and  N   means  the  field  of  the  nucleus,  which  in  this  case  works  as  a
resonator.  Note  that  the  reaction  of  electron-positron  pair  production  from  a  photon  formally  in
the same way is also described:
=

+

+

, 

e

ne   "is  composed"  from  electron  in  the  state 

The  record  (3.1)  is  possible  to  be  considered  as  an  instruction  that  the  electron  in  a  mass-
energy  state 
be   and  a  photon  g .  To  this  it
corresponds  the  statement  of  the  problem  of  the  description  of  a  compound  particle  by  the
solution of the wave equation for the given potential well (we will for brevity name this problem
as direct problem). In particular, for reaction (3.1) such equation is the Schroedinger equation (i.e.
Helmholtz  equation  for  de  Broglie  waves),  and  for  reaction  (3.2)  is  the  Dirac  equation.  The
solution of Schroedinger equation gives spectra, which are allowed by a potential well (resonator)
of system (in this case, Coulomb field of a proton). But this solution does not take into account
and does not describe the concrete reason of  formation of this or that level.

Another statement of the problem (an “inverse” problem of particle mass calculation) arises in

case we shall write down the reaction (3.1) in the opposite direction:

 

g

e

(3.3)

Here  initial  particles:  g -quantum  and  electron 
  can  be  considered  as  the  reason  of
occurrence  of  a  compound  particle.  In  this  case,  obviously,  for  calculation  of  energy-mass  of  a
compound particle 
  it  is  necessary  to  know  the  experimental  characteristics  of  waves
(particles), which have actually formed this level of energy.

e e-
( n

e e-
( b

It  is  not  difficult  to  see  that  these  problems  can  be  considered  as  necessary  and  sufficient

conditions of formation of spectra.

It is easy to understand that the problem of the first type is reduced to the solution of the non-
linear wave equations of  Heisenberg non-linear equation type. Unfortunately, the solution of the
last,  despite  of  a  number  of  achievements  (in  particular,  the  existence  of  spectra  of  masses  of
particles has really been shown), had difficulties, which are not overcome till now. Therefore we
will  try  to  solve  this  problem  in  linear  approach,  taking  into  account  the  known  integrated
characteristics of an initial particle (in this case, of electron).

As concrete example of compound particle formation we will consider the reactions (3.1) and
(3.2). In these reactions the electron behaves simultaneously both as a particle and as a wave. The
following paragraphs  will be devoted to  the brief  analysis of  kinematic  and  wave  properties  of
particles.

Considering the particles 1 and 2 as composite parts of particle 0,  we can according to N.

5.0. The wave characteristics of elementary particles

As  it  is  known  the  de  Broglie  wave  is  a  clearly  relativistic  effect,  connected  with  relative
motion  of  electron  in  relation  to  other  bodies  (in  particular,  to  a  proton).  As  the  de  Broglie
analysis  shows,  the  wave  occurrence  can  be  connected  with  relativistic  Doppler  effect,  but  the
deep reasons of this phenomenon remain unknown for us.

Let’s analyse these expressions.
At first, we will note the interesting feature of de Broglie wave: it consists of infinite series of

waves, which frequencies sum up arithmetically.

Secondly,  the  “base”  wave  exists,  which  high  frequency 

0n does  not  depend  on  the  particle

motion.

particle  motion  and  correspond  to  separate  terms  of  expansion 

Thirdly,  a  number  of  waves  exist,  the  frequencies  of  which  depend  on  the  velocity  of  the
.  .The  values  of  the
frequencies  of  these  waves  are  far  less  than  the  frequency 
0n   of  the  main  wave,  so  that  these
waves  modulate  the  main  wave.  What  role  do  these  waves  separately  play  in  nature,  we  do  not
know, but their sum defines all wave effects of particles motion: motion of electron in the atom,
diffraction of electron into slots and other.

Fourthly,  from  above  very  serious  consequence  follows  that:  the  frequency  of  the  “based”
0n  of the particle defines the Compton wavelength of rest particle and its “bare” mass:

Fifthly, at zero speed of particle motion the de  Broglie wavelength is equal to infinity, which
for  classical  oscillator  corresponds  to  zero  frequency  of  oscillation.  But  for  de  Broglie  wave
frequency  in  this  case  we  obtain  a  value  other  than  zero.  Actually,  we  obtain  a  rather  big
frequency 

1510  Hz, which does not depend on the speed of electron motion.

It is easy to see, that in case of hydrogen atom the formation of new levels of electron energy-
mass occurs not because the electron itself absorbs a photon as a resonator, but a resonator formed
by a potential well of a nucleus.

It is possible to tell that in this case, nature has thought up the smart mechanism, at which to
the big and constant frequency of own wave of the rest electron, corresponds the frequency of an
additional wave, which changes from zero to infinity, depending on the speed of electron motion
as a particle.

We  will  try  to  show  now  that  it  is  possible  to  explain  a  spectrum  of  masses  of  elementary
particles similarly to the spectrum of electron masses in hydrogen atom, taking into account that
in this case the particle itself plays role of the resonator for additional particles.

6.0. To calculation of mass spectra of elementary particles

6.1. A direct problem

As  examples  of  the  elementary  reactions  of  production  and  disintegration  of  elementary

particles (see (Review of Particle Properties, 1994).) are:

1) reaction of electron-positron pair production 

2)  muon  decay

We can consider these reactions as superposition of the twirled photons and semi-photons. . In
this case muon or taon are possibly thought of as consisting of the electronic linear polarized half-
wave and two neutrino circularly polarized half-waves with the opposite direction of rotation.

It  is  also  similarly  possible  to  consider  other  reactions,  without  the  infringement  of

corresponding conservation laws; for example:

We will consider a particle 

iX  (see (4.1)) as the given resonator, and particles

 as the

unknown waves, which satisfy to resonance conditions of this resonator.

Since  the  unique  particle,  about  the  sizes  of  which  we  can  speak  with  some  share  of
confidence,  is  the  electron,  we  will  consider  these  three  reactions,  in  which  the  electron  is  the
lowest level of a mass spectrum. (Here instead of one photon (with spin 1) in  Putilov  approach,
we  have  both  neutrino  and  antineutrino  with  the  half  spin,  moving  to  the  opposite  directions;
therefore for simplification of calculation of mass we will consider two neutrino as one photon).

As we have shown (Kyriakos, 2003) the electron equation can be considered not only as (in the
quantum form)  the    Dirac  equation,  but  in  non-linear  electromagnetic  form  as  the  equation  of
twirled  semi-photon.  The  free  Dirac  electron  equation  is  satisfied  by  any  mass,  not  only  the
electron  mass.  Reasoning  from  this  fact,  let’s  consider  the  Dirac  electron  equation  with  an
external field:

the additional waves (i.e. the basic wave  and  additional waves should be commensurable), they
should satisfy the following condition of  wave quantization:

Despite the satisfactory concurrence of calculated and experimental values of masses of known

casual concurrence improbable. It is also confirmed with calculations of particle masses according

Abstract:  The  research  shows  that  the  Heisenberg  principle  is  the  logic  results  of  general  relativity 

principle. If inertia coordinator system is used, the general relativity will logically be derived from the 

Heisenberg  principle.  The  intrinsic  relation  between  the  quantum  mechanics  and  general  relativity  is 

broken  by  introducing  pure-imaginary  time  to  explain  the  Lorentz  transformation.  Therefore,  this 

research shows a way to establish an unified field theory of physics.

1. Introduction 

There are many documents to treat the relationship between the Newton mechanics and general 

relativity. There are also many documents to treat the relationship between the quantum mechanics and 

general  relativity.  For  some  researchers,  the  related  research  shows  that  an  unified  field  theory  be 

possible. For others, the actual efforts to establish an unified field theory for physics have shown that 

such an unified field theory is totally non-possible. The physics world is divided into three kingdoms. 

Hence,  the  title  of  this  paper  may  make  the  reader  think:  See!  Another  nut!  However,  the 

unification of matter motion is the basic relieves for science researchers. The real problem is to find the 

way. This is the topic of this paper. The paper will firstly derive the Heisenberg principle from general 

relativity  principle.  Secondly,  the  general  relativity  principle  is  derived  from  Heisenberg  principle. 

Finely, the way to construct an unified field theory is suggested.   

2. Derive Heisenberg Principle from General Relativity 

Based on the general idea of Einstein space-time theory, the vacuum space-time is described by

physical  consideration,  the  initial  co-moving  coordinator  system  can  be  defined  as  the  standard

Where,  c   is light speed in “vacuum”. 

In  general  relativity,  matter  (motion)  can  be  expressed  by  displacement  field

It  is  clear  that  the  incremental  motion  of  matter  is  viewed  as  “deformation”  of  space-time 

geometry.  So,  gravitation  field  is  viewed  as  matter  “deformation”  respect  with  idea  vacuum  matter. 

According to Einstein's idea, the Newton’s inertia coordinator system can be replaced by the gradient 

field of infinitesimal displacement. The Equation (2) shows that the displacement gradient determines 

the  current  local  geometry.  Hence,  the  transformation  tensor 

i

jF   can  be  named  as  matter  motion 

transformation. Matter motion in four-dimensional form is:

Based on Schwarzschild solution, a point mass gravity field will require that for some 

3,2,1=i

, 

≠

0

. Hence, it is reasonable to infer that some 

3,2,1=i

, 

≠

0

. On this sense, a mass

                                                        (8) 

It means that the mass existence is represented by a non-zero time duration (displacement) gradient. 

The geometric invariant quantity for the time duration

In  general  relativity,  they  must  be  identical.  To  make  them  be  equivalents,  space  displacement 
must  be  introduced. As  the  space displacement  is related  with  time  duration,  they  should  be put  into 

Equation (9-2). By Equations (1), (6), (7), and (9), the

As  the  time  displacement  differentiation  about  time  is  matter  intrinsic  feature  from  physical 

consideration (science laws will not change for different measurement time), the ratio between the time 

displacement and space variation must be constant for a given “static” matter. This, in intrinsic sense, 

just is the kernel of Heisenberg Principle (although which takes different form for different purpose).

It show that the quantum energy is related with the space displace field. Let  Sδ   be unit, it means that 

the quantum constant  h   is determined by the time displacement differentiation about time, also. 

For classical quantum mechanics, the matter intrinsic feature  K   is interpreted as wave number 

 
function of matter.   

Hence,  the  time  displacement  differentiation  about  time  defines  quantum  matter.  Based  on  this 

understanding, the quantum mechanics is the science about time field. Therefore, the general relativity 

can be taken as the start point of quantum mechanics rather than be viewed as independent. 

Summing  up  above  reasoning,  the  Heisenberg  Principle  is  derived  from  General  Relativity. 

Furthermore, the definition of quantum moment and energy quantity is the logic conclusion of general 

relativity. 

3. Derive General Relativity from Heisenberg Principle 

To  derive  general  relativity  from  Heisenberg  principle,  the  definition  of  the  initial  co-moving 

coordinator system must be modified as an inertia coordinator system, that is:

From  the  Heisenberg  Principle,  the  general  form  of  geometrical  quantity  must  be  bigger  than  a 

quantity which is related with the matter under discussion. That is:

                            (15) 

If the matter position is accurately measured during time interval  dt , the equation can be rewritten as:

As in the commoving coordinator system, the matter is the same matter, the following quantity must be 

physical feature function:

As the time is homogenously flowing in inertia coordinator system, according to the definition of 

inertia  coordinator  system,  for  the  matter  static  in  an  inertia  coordinator  system,  other  inertia  system 

must be transformed by maintaining the following quantity be invariant. That is:

  is  the 

matter feature function. This is observed for electromagnetic field. It is also derived by Einstein from 

the  time  synchronization  for  relative  moving  inertia  coordinator  system.  Based  on  physical 

consideration, the matter feature is invariant for any inertia coordinator system.   

Extending  the  Equation  (20)  to  Riemannian  geometry,  Einstein  establishes  the  basic  foundation 

for the general relativity theory. 

4. Conclusion 

Based  on  this  research,  the  intrinsic  relation  between  the  quantum  mechanics  and  general 

relativity is broken by introducing pure-imaginary time to explain the Lorentz transformation. Although 

the development of physics shows that there is no contradict between both, the real history of physics is 

very roundabout. The four-dimensional inertia coordinator system (defined by Equation (14)) is ruled 

out  from  the  general  relativity.  Some  even  view  this  as  the  revolution  of  physics  from  Newton  to 

Einstein.  However,  based  on  this  research,  the  general  relativity  is  the  logic  extension  of  Newton 

Surely, without the Heisenberg principle, this extension is not possible. Therefore, the Heisenberg 

principle not only bridges up the gap between the quantum mechanics and general relativity, but also 

bridges up the gap between the Newton mechanics and general relativity. If the general relativity theory 

is modified by using real time coordinators as shown in this paper, the physics is unified. Hence, the 

unified field theory can be established. For a possible geometrical theory, please view [1-4].

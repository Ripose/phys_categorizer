Abstract 

We  will  use  EPICS  toolkit  [1]  to  build  a  prototype 
for upgrading BEPC control system. The purposes  are 
for  the  following  three  aspects:  (1)  Setup  a  network 
based distributed control system with EPICS. (2) Study 
some  front-end  control  technology.  (3)  Merge  the 
existing  control  system  into  EPICS.  The  hardware 
architecture consists of three physical layers. The front-
end layer  is  VME  crate,  PowerPC,  VME  I/O  modules 
and  interface  boards  (VME-CAMAC  and  Fieldbus). 
The back-end layer is SUN workstation, which is used 
as  application  development.  The 
layers  are 
connected via the middle layer which is 100M Ethernet. 
In order to preserve our investment in the hardware, the 
existing CAMAC hardware  will  remain.  The  CAMAC 
will  be  connected  to  the  VME  via  CAMAC  serial 
highway  [3].  The  operator  interface  will  be  developed 
with  EPICS  DM2K.  High-level  accelerator  control 
applications will be studied as well with EPICS channel 
access and archive access.

1 INTRODUCTION 
BEPC  consists  of  a  200  m  long  linac  and  storage 
ring  with  a  circumference  of  240.4  m.  It  can  produce 
some  extremely  important  high  energy  physics  and 
synchrotron radiation.  

The storage ring control system was transplant from 
SPEAR  in  1987.  The  upgrade  of  this  system  in  1994 
was  to  replace  a  couple  of  very  old  systems,  which 
were either already obsolete or unsupported (VAX750, 
Grinnell,  VCC).  The  upgraded  system  has  worked 
reliably for us.  

 But  this  system  after  the  upgrade  still  has  the 
following shortcoming: (1). It heavily dependent on the 
VMS  operating  system  and  CAMAC.    (2).  It  is  not 
open to the option  of  non-  CAMAC  hardware  such  as 
VME.  (3).  There  is  a  communication  bottleneck 
because  real-time  data  reside  in  shared  memory  on  a 
is 
single  computer.  (4).  The  operator 
intimately  bound  to  the  application  programs  and  is 
primitive by today’s standards.  

interface 

is 

the 

importance 

The  most 

accelerator-
commissioning  model  of  BEPCII  is  different  from 
BEPC,  so  the  accelerator  commissioning  programs 
have  to  be  transferred  and  modified  from  other 
laboratories.  In 
the  existing  real-time 
database cannot any more matches the new transferred 

this  case, 

applications  and  the  old  OPI  written  by  FORTH 
language  can  neither  be  used  in  future.  Except  some 
subsystems  and  hardware,  the  control  system  and  its 
software architecture have to be upgraded. 

The  linac  control  is  different  from  the  ring.  It  uses 
PC  with  remote  I/O  via  RS422  to  control  the  devices. 
The  console  in  the  ring  only  can  access  some  dada  in 
linac via the network. 

2 REQUIRMENTS AND OPTIONS 

2.1 Requirements 

Our motivation for doing the upgrade of BEPC is to 
meet  BEPCII  requirements.  BEPCII  will  construct 
double  rings  in  the  current  tunnel.  BEPCII  will  add 
some high voltage switch power supplies in each ring. 
There are about 400-magnet power supplies distributed 
around the rings and transport lines of BEPCII. So, we 
need to build new power supply control system on the 
rings. In order to preserve our investment, the CAMAC 
in the transport line will remain. We will take a power 
supply  as  an  example  in  the  prototype  and  implement 
the  control  of  the  power  supply  with  EPICS.  For  the 
requirements of the power supply control are: 

•  Current setting synchronously without beam loss. 
• 
the fastest time period is 30ms/per step setting. 

2.2  Options 

Several  proposals  were  discussed  on  how  to  meet 
their  requirements.  The  proposals  submitted  consisted 
of: 

•  VME + Fieldbus + Intelligent Device controller. 
•  VME + direct I/O. 
We did some market survey for the fieldbus such as 
Canbus, DeviceNet, ControlNe and Profibus. We think 
that Canbus only has two-layer protocol supported with 
1Mbps speed; it’s hard to develop software with 1Mbps 
speed.  SSRF 
the 
DeviceNet communication software between IOCs and 
device  controller.  Although  ControlNet  is  fast  than 
DeviceNet,  but  they  both  have  a  bit  problem  with 
signal synchrotron processing. So, it is suitable for slow 
control such as vacuum system etc. The power supplies 
on  the  rings  can  be  directly  controlled  by  VME  I/O 
module.

We  are  also  considering  ControlNet  for  vacuum 
control  because  EPICS  already  supported  ControlNet. 
We  can  get  the  CpontrolNet  driver  from  the  vacuum 
control group of SNS/BNL.  

3 ARCHITECTURE OF THE 
PROTOTYPE 
The  prototype  consists  of  a  Sun  workstation,  a  PC 
and  VMEbus  systems  as  shown  in  figure  1.  The  Sun 
workstation is used as development. The PC is used as 
OPI. There are three ways to control the devices.  One 
is  VME-fieldbus  interface  controller  and  a  device 
controller.  Another 
is  VME  direct  I/O  module.  
Another  more  is  VME-CAMAC  interface  module.  In 
addition, we will install EPICS/PCAS on a PC running 
LibView for merge the PC system into EPICS. 

Our  main  goal  for  the  prototype  is:  (1).  Setup 
hardware  and  software  architecture  with  EPICS.  (2). 
Study key technology of the control system integration. 
(3). Merge the existing PC and CAMAC into EPICS.    

4 PLANS 
We plan to construct EPICS Real-time database with 
CapFast  and  ASCII  file  according  to  the  BEPCII 
database name convention. We will build new operator 
screens with DM2k. We will do EPICS applications on 
 

the prototype control system for the power supplies and 
measure  the  precision  and  update  rate  of  acquisition 
signals.  We  also  will  develop  the  application  for 
vacuum  with  VME-fieldbus.  Meanwhile  we  will 
develop high-level accelerator control applications. 

Finally, we will test new IOCs on some subsystems. 
The  power  supply  system  and  vacuum  system  will  be 
first. Then, other  subsystems  can  also  be  implemented 
with EPICS soon.

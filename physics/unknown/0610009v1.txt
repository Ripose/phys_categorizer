Abstract 

In situ, high-resolution, gamma-ray spectrometry of a total number of 70 outdoor and 20 

indoor representative measurements were performed in preselected, common locations 

of the main urban areas of Cyprus. Specific activities and gamma absorbed dose rates in 

air  due  to  the  naturally  occurring  radionuclides  of  232Th  and  238U  series,  and  40K  are 

determined and discussed. Effective dose rate to the Cyprus population due to terrestrial 

gamma  radiation  is  derived  directly  from  this  work.    The  results  obtained  outdoors 

match very well with those derived previously by high-resolution gamma spectrometry 

of  soil  samples,  which  were  collected  from  the  main  island  bedrock  surface.  This 

implies  that  the  construction  and  building  materials  in  urban  areas  do  not  affect  the 

external  gamma  dose  rate;  thus  they  are  mostly  of  local  origin.  Finally,  the 

indoor/outdoor gamma dose ratio was found to be 1.4 ± 0.5.

INTRODUCTION 

One of the main external sources of irradiation to the human body is represented by the 

gamma radiation (terrestrial  environmental background  radiation) emitted by naturally 

occurring radioisotopes. The most prominent naturally occurring radioisotopes are  40K 

and the radionuclides  from the  232Th  and  238U  series  with  their  decay  products,  which 

exist at trace levels in all ground formations. During the last decades, extensive surveys 

have  been  carried  out  worldwide  to  determine  activity  concentration  levels  and 

associated dose rates due to terrestrial gamma radiation (see UNSCEAR 2000 report (1), 

and  further  references  cited  therein).    Such  investigations  are  important  not  only  for 

assessing  population  exposure  and  performing  epidemiological  studies,  but  also  for 

serving as a reference (baseline data) to possible environmental contaminations due to 

human activities.  

The first systematic data on environmental gamma radiation and associated dose rates in 

Cyprus were obtained by a series of measurements(2,3,4), which have been carried out at 

the Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the Department of Physics, University of Cyprus, in 

the framework of a project called “radioisotopes”.  The  standard  soil  sampling  method 

and  the  laboratory  measurement  technique  by  means  of  high-resolution  gamma 

spectrometry were employed for this work. The first results were based on 28 samples 

collected  from  the  main  geological  rock  types  in  the  island(2).  An  extensive  survey  of 

terrestrial gamma radioactivity was performed after the systematic collection of 115 soil 

samples,  stemming  from  the  main  island  bedrock  surface(3,4).  However,  the  soil 

sampling  method  cannot  be  applied  to  urban  areas,  where  most  of  the  Cyprus 

population is, since building and other construction materials might affect the external 

 

2

dose rate. Moreover, this type of study cannot be used, at all, to determine directly the 

gamma  dose  rate  in  the  interior  of  buildings  and  dwellings  (indoor  environments), 

where  the  people  spend  most  of  their  time  (about  80%).  The  in  situ  high-resolution 

gamma  spectrometry  is  highly  requested  for  reliable  results  in  indoor/outdoor  urban 

environments(5). 

 The main goal of the present study is to provide the first in situ high-resolution gamma 

spectrometry  measurements  outdoors  and  indoors  in  the  main  urban  areas  of  Cyprus, 

and to determine accurately the effective dose to the population due to terrestrial gamma 

radiation.  The  in  situ  gamma  spectrometry  was  performed,  utilizing  a  high-resolution 

portable Ge detector.   

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Gamma-ray spectroscopic system  

In situ  gamma  measurements  were  conducted  using  a  portable  high-purity  germanium 

(HPGe) detector (coaxial cylinder of 50.1 mm in diameter and 44 mm in length) with a 

relative  efficiency  of  15%  and  an  energy  resolution  (FWHM)  of  1.8  keV  at  the  1.33 

MeV  reference  transition  of  60Co.  The  detector  is  coupled  to  a  cryostat,  dipped  into  a 

small  dewar  (capacity  3  l)  filled  with  liquid  nitrogen,  that  features  in  all-attitude 

capability.  The  whole  system  was  mounted  on  a  movable  small  vehicle  at  a  fixed 

position, with the (detector) Ge crystal facing the ground at a height of 1 m.  For this 

survey,  the  “ORTEC  Nomad  Plus  Portable  Spectroscopy  System”  was  used,  which 

incorporates a high-voltage power supply, a spectroscopy amplifier and a multi-channel 

buffer (MCB) consisting of a 16k ADC in a compact unit. An advanced multi-channel 

analyser (MCA) emulation software (GammaVision-32(6)) enabled control of the power 

 

3

supply  and  amplifier  as  well  as  control  of  the  data  acquisition,  storage,  display  and 

analysis of the acquired spectra.  

Counting and data analysis 

During  the  period  February  –  June  2006,  a  total  number  of  70  outdoor  and  20  indoor 

measurements  were  carried  out  in  accessible  urban  areas  of  the  Republic  of  Cyprus, 

which  is  divided  into  the  five  main  districts  shown  in  Figure  1.  Table  1  presents  the 

district, the population(7), and the number of outdoor/indoor measurements performed in 

each district. The present study was concentrated on - and around - the five main towns 

indicated in Fig. 1, where live more than 90% of the people(7). Outdoor measurements 

were taken near public buildings (hospitals, schools,  civil  services,  etc),  pavements  of 

main city roads and frequented national parks and gardens. Indoor measurements were 

carried out in the interior of public buildings of the Lefkosia district.  The duration of 

each measurement was 1 h with a statistical accuracy of about 3 to 8% for the measured 

photopeaks of interest.  

Derivation of the specific activities from the in situ gamma-ray spectra  

Measured  gamma  radiation  spectra  were  analysed  using  the  ORTEC  M-1  analysis 

code(8).  This code uses the GammaVision peak fitting and analysis algorithm combined 

with  the  “1-meter”  methodology  developed  by  the  U.  S.  Department  of  Energy- 

Environmental  Measurements  Laboratory  (EML)    (see  Beck  et  al.(9)),  and  has  been 

further  developed  by  Helfer  and  Miller(10).    This  methodology  was  initially  applied  to 

field gamma measurements to account for directly activity concentrations due to natural 

or  human-made  radionuclides.  It  reduces  a  complex  measurement  problem  to  the 

product of three, simply determined factors, which have been calculated for a range of 

 

4

detector types and ground (soil) conditions and are tabulated within the program. Over 

the years, this technique has been adopted and improved by other authors; see, e.g. the 

ICRU report 53(11), and Clouvas et al.(12) for application of this method to measurements 

in an indoor environment.  

According  to  the  M-1  analysis  procedure(8),  the  measured  absorption  photopeak  count 

rate is converted into a specific activity, AE (Bq m−2 or Bq g−1), in the ground (soil) by 

the product of the three factors that correspond to each of the identified radionuclides. 

The  only  necessary  parameters  to  insert  in  the  code  are  the  detector  efficiency,  the 

detector  aspect  ratio  calculated  from  the  crystal  dimensions  (length/diameter),  and  the 

deposition  profile  parameter  (α/ρ  values)(8).  The  latter  is  equal  to  0  for  uniformly 

distributed natural emitters.  

In  indoor  environments,  however,  the  situation  becomes  more  complex:  the  gamma-

source geometry is generally unknown, and gamma radiation comes not only from the 

ground,  but  also  from  the  walls  and  roofs.  The  building  materials  act  as  sources  of 

radiation and also as shields against outdoor radiation. In this case, the walls efficiently 

absorb the gamma rays emitted outdoors, and the indoor absorbed rate depends mainly 

on the activity concentrations of the natural radionuclides in the building materials(5). 

Most  of  the  buildings  and  houses  in  Cyprus  contain  strengthened  reinforced  concrete 

frames, walls from bricks, roofs from concrete and tiles above the reinforced concrete 

floor.  The  walls  are  covered  by  plaster.  Building  materials  are  usually  of  local  origin 

and  therefore  radionuclide  concentrations  are  similar  to  local  soil.      In  such  cases, 

detailed Monte-Carlo simulations that include different indoor geometries and gamma-

source  distributions  are  needed  to  obtain  reliable  results  on  the  specific  activities  and 

 

5

associated absorbed dose rates. However, Clouvas et al.(12) have shown, by performing 

such  calculations,  that  the  results  obtained  do  not  depend  strongly  on  the  different 

parameters such as the dimension of the rooms, the thickness of walls, the density of the 

building  materials,  and  the  gamma-source  geometry,  but  they  mostly  depend  on  the 

activity concentrations of the natural radionuclides contained in the building materials. 

Indeed, the build-up-factors, which enter into the determination of the gamma absorbed 

dose  rates,  do  not  differ  by  more  than  10-12%  between  outdoor  and  indoor 

measurements(5).  Therefore,  the  same  analysis  code  (ORTEC  M-1)  and  the  procedure 

described  above  were  applied  to  determine  the  specific  activities  of  the  natural 

radionuclides  in  the  present  indoor  measurements.  Under  these  circumstances,  the 

indoor/outdoor ratio of the absorbed dose rates in air is expected to be higher than one 

as a result of the change in gamma-source geometry.  

The radionuclides that were considered in the present analysis are: 214Bi (main transition 

at ∼609  keV, ∼46.1%),  228Ac  (∼911  keV, ∼29%),  and  40K  (∼1461  keV, ∼10.7%).  The 

232Th and  238U activities were estimated from the corresponding activities of the short-

lived  228Ac and  214Bi radioisotopes, under the assumption that secular equilibrium was 

reached  between  232Th  and  238U  and  their  decay  products.  Concerning  this  point,  one 

should  notice  that  equilibrium  is  common  in  rocks  older  than  106  years,  and  that  the 

232Th series may be considered in equilibrium in most geological environments (Chiozzi 

et  al.(13)).  On  the  contrary,  the  40K  activity  was  determined  directly  from  the 

measurement of the strong gamma-ray photopeak at 1460.75 keV (see ref.(2) for details). 

The Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) was calculated to be ∼4 Bq kg−1 for 232Th, ∼2 

Bq kg−1 for 238U, and ∼6 Bq kg−1 for 40K, for a counting time of 1 hour. Only naturally 

 

6

occurring radionuclides were detected in the measured spectra, with an exception of a 

small  contamination  of  137Cs  due  to  the  Chernobyl  nuclear  accident.  The  latter  was 

present  in  some  outdoor  measurements  with  a  mean  activity  of  ∼270  Bq m−2  or  ∼5.5 

Bq kg−1. Its contribution to the total gamma dose rate is insignificant and, therefore, it 

has been neglected.   

Derivation of the absorbed dose rates and effective dose rates  

If naturally occurring radioactive nuclides are uniformly distributed, the dose rates at 1 

m above the ground surface, D (in units of nGy h−1), can be calculated by the following 

equation(2,14): 

 

D = AE CF, 

 (1)

where  AE  is  the  measured  specific  activity  (Bq  kg−1)  of  the  radionuclide  and  CF  is  a 

conversion  factor  (nGy  h−1  per  Bq  kg−1).    In  the  present  work,  mean  values  of  CF  = 

0.528, 0.389 and 0.039 nGy h−1 per Bq kg−1 were used in the dose rate calculations for 

232Th series, 238U series, and 40K, respectively  (see ref.(2)  for details). 

The  annual  effective  dose  rate  to  the  population,  HE,  is  calculated  by  the  following 

EH

=

D T F

, 

(2)

where  D  is  the  calculated  total  dose  rate,  T    is  the  occupancy  time  (T=  f  ×24×365.25 

hy−1,    f  is  the  occupancy  factor  with  values  of    0.2  and  0.8  for  outdoor  and  indoor 

measurements, respectively), and F is the conversion factor (0.7 Sv Gy−1)(1).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

In Table 2, the range and mean value of the outdoor specific activities of the naturally 

occurring  232Th,  238U,  and  40K  radionuclides  for  each  of  the  5  main  urban  districts  are 

presented.  The specific-activity values ranged from 1.7 to 25.0 Bq kg−1 for 232Th, from 

5.4 to 31.8 Bq kg−1 for 238U, and from 81 to 388 Bq kg−1 for 40K.  The average specific 

activity of  232Th,  238U, and  40K  ranged  from  9.9  to  11.9  Bq kg−1 with a mean  (A.M. ± 

S.D.) of 10.6 ± 5.1 Bq kg−1, from 11.6 to 16.5 Bq kg−1 with a mean of 14.2 ± 5.7 Bq kg−1, 

and from 146 to 160 Bq kg−1 with a mean of 153 ± 56 Bq kg−1, respectively.  

The  present  results  on  the  outdoor  specific  activity  of  the  three  naturally  occurring 

radionuclides  are  in  very  good  agreement  with  the  corresponding  values  obtained 

previously by laboratory high-resolution gamma spectrometry of soil samples from the 

main geological formations of Cyprus(3,4).  The 5 districts covered by the present in situ 

measurements belong to 4 different geological formations of sedimentary origin, which 

have  been  studied  and  discussed  in  details  (with  respect  to  naturally  occurring 

radioactivity) elsewhere(3,4).  According to these, the averaged specific activities over all 

main sedimentary formations were found to be (A.M ± S.D.) (3):  9.3 ± 8.1, 13.2 ± 8.8, 

and 147 ± 98 Bq kg−1, for 232Th, 238U and 40K, respectively. It should be pointed out here 

that  the  median  values  derived  from  population-weighted  data  available  worldwide(1) 

are: 30, 35, and 400 Bq kg−1, respectively. Hence, the maximum activity values obtained 

from  the  present  in  situ  measurements  of  naturally  occurring  232Th,  238U  and  40K 

radioisotopes are still below the corresponding worldwide mean activity values reported 

in the UNSCEAR 2000 Report(1). 

 

8

As expected, the average activity concentrations of the three radionuclides are higher in 

the indoor measurements: the specific-activity values ranged from 4.9 to 21.5 Bq kg−1 

with  a  mean  value  of  11.4  ±  4.6  Bq  kg−1  for  232Th,  from  12.3  to  37.1  Bq  kg−1  with  a 

mean of 23.1 ± 5.9 Bq kg−1for 238U, and from 174 to 320 Bq kg−1 with a mean of 222 ± 

45 Bq kg−1 for 40K.   

The gamma absorbed dose rates in air were calculated from the specific activities of the 

232Th,  238U, and  40K radionuclides according to Equation (1), in a similar manner than 

that described in details by Tzortzis et al.(2).  The results are presented in Table 3. The 

calculated  total  dose  rates  in  air  outdoors  ranged  from  9.6  to  39.4  nGy h−1  with  mean 

values (A.M.  ±  S.D.) of 17.3 ±  5.7, 16.7 ± 6.4, 16.5 ± 5.8, 16.4 ± 5.5 and 18.7 ± 5.8 

nGy h−1,  for  the  5  urban  districts  shown  in  Table  1,  respectively.  The  corresponding 

values in the indoor measurements ranged from 16.7 to 36.0 nGy h−1 with a mean value 

of 23.6 ± 5.4 nGy h−1. In Figure 2, the frequency distribution of the total absorbed dose 

rates for all the outdoor and indoor measurements is plotted. 

Using the calculated indoor and outdoor mean values of the absorbed dose rates in air, 

the indoor/outdoor ratio is found to be equal 1.4 ± 0.5. This value depends mainly on 

the  activity  concentrations  of  the  three  naturally  occurring  radioisotopes  (232Th,  238U, 

and  40K)  in  the  building  and  tilling  materials  used  in  the  house  construction.  It  is 

expected  to  be  about  constant  for  the  urban  areas  of  Cyprus  due  to  the  fact  that  the 

house construction technique used is very similar everywhere and the building materials 

are  mostly  of  local  origin.  It  is  worth  pointing  out  here,  that  the  calculated 

indoor/outdoor  ratio  matches  very  well  with  the  value  of  1.42,  which  can  be  derived 

from worldwide averaged data(1). 

 

9

 The contribution of the 40K, 238U and 232Th radionuclides to the mean total dose rate is 

found  to  be  almost  equal  among  those  three  radionuclides  (34.7%,  32.5%  and  32.8%, 

respectively)  for  all  the  outdoor  measurements.  This  is  in  accordance  with  previous 

results(3).  Furthermore,  in  the  indoor  measurements,  due  to  the  building  materials,  a 

slight enhancement in the relative contribution of the 238U and 40K radionuclides to the 

total  dose  is  observed    (36.3%,  38.1%  and  25.6%,  due  to  40K,  238U  and  232Th, 

respectively).   

Next, the total effective dose rates to the population were calculated from the outdoor 

and indoor absorbed dose rate in air, using Equation (2) and assuming that the people 

spend  20%  of  their  time  outdoors  and  80%  indoors.  In  the  districts  where  no  indoor 

measurements were performed, the estimated indoor/outdoor ratio of 1.4 for the gamma 

absorbed rates was used to calculate the indoor effective dose rates for these districts.  

The calculated total effective dose rates to the population ranged from 78 to 319 µSv y−1 

with a mean value (A.M. ± S.D.) of 138 ± 46 µSv y−1.  As a consequence, the population 

living in urban areas of Cyprus is subjected to a mean effective dose rate of about 138 

µSv y−1  due  to  naturally  occurring  gamma  radiation.  This  important  component  of  the 

natural  radiation  has  been  determined  directly,  by  means  of  in  situ  high-resolution 

gamma spectrometry, for the first time and it is representative for the main urban areas 

of Cyprus.  

In  the  following,  an  attempt  is  made  to  estimate  the  average  total  radiation  exposure 

(mean  total  effective  dose)  to  the  inhabitants  of  the  island  due  to  the  three  most 

important  components  of  the  naturally  occurring  radioactivity:  cosmic  rays,  terrestrial 

gamma  radiation,  and  radon  (222Rn)  concentration.  According  to  the  UNSCEAR  2000 

 

10

report(1), the population-weighted average absorbed dose rate from the directly ionising 

and photon components of the cosmic radiation at sea level corresponds to 31 nGy h−1, 

resulting  in  an  effective  dose  rate  of  270 µSv y−1.    From  the  present  study,  the  mean 

effective dose rate due to terrestrial gamma radiation is found to be ∼138 µSv y−1, which 

is obtained from the calculated mean absorbed dose rate of 17.0 nGy h−1 (outdoors) and 

23.6  nGy h−1  (indoors).  This  value  is  by  a  factor  of  about  3.5  smaller  than  the 

corresponding  worldwide  average  value(1)  of  480 µSv y−1.    From  the  measured  radon 

(222Rn)  mean  concentrations(15)  of  19.3  Bq m−3  (indoors)  and  3.9  Bq m−3  (outdoors),  a 

mean  effective  dose  rate  of  527  µSv y−1  is  calculated  for  the  radon  component  in 

Cyprus.    This  value  has  to  be  compared  with  the  corresponding  worldwide  average 

value(1)  of  1095µSv y−1.  The  results  are  summarized  in  Table  4.  As  can  be  seen,  the 

population in Cyprus is subjected to a total radiation exposure (total effective dose) that 

exhibits  a  mean  value  of  935µSv y−1,  as  far  as  concern  the  three  components  of  the 

natural radiation, which is by a factor of two smaller than the corresponding worldwide 

average  exposure  of  1845  µSv y−1.  This  implies  that  the  island  of  Cyprus  can  be 

considered as one of the world areas that exhibit very low levels of natural radioactivity. 

The contribution of each of these three components to the mean total effective dose to 

the  Cyprus  population  is  depicted  in  Figure  3  in  comparison  with  the  corresponding 

worldwide averaged values.   

As  a  final  remark,  the  results  obtained  by  the  present  in  situ  high-resolution  gamma 

measurements outdoors are not valid to the small villages situated around the Troodos 

Mountains,  which  geologically  form  a  best-preserved  ophiolitic  complex  in  the  world 

that  is  known  as  “the  Troodos  ophiolitic  complex  of  Cyprus”(2,3,4).    This  region  is 

 

11

characterized  by  igneous  rocks,  which  are  very  poor  in  Th  and  U  radioelement 

concentrations(16). The activity concentrations of these two radionuclides in the Troodos 

ophiolithic  complex  were  found  to  be  an  order  of  magnitude  lower  than  the 

corresponding values observed in the other main formations of Cyprus with sedimentary 

origin(3,4).       

CONCLUSION 

In situ high-resolution γ−ray spectrometry was exploited to determine specific activities 

and  the  associated  gamma  dose  rates  due  to  naturally  occurring  232Th,  238U,  and  40K 

radioisotopes in 70 outdoor and 20 indoor measurements for the main urban areas of the 

island of Cyprus.  From the measured activities of these radionuclides, gamma absorbed 

dose rates in air were calculated outdoors and indoors. Hence, the effective dose rate to 

the population due to terrestrial gamma radiation could be determined accurately. The 

calculated values ranged from 78 to 319 µSv y−1 with a mean value of 138 ± 46 µSv y−1, 

which is by a factor of 3.5 lower than the value (480 µSv y−1) derived from worldwide 

averaged  data(1).  Considering  all  the  three  components  of  the  naturally  occurring 

radioactivity  (terrestrial  gamma  radiation,  cosmic  rays,  and  radon  concentration),  a 

mean total effective dose of about 935 µSv y−1 is calculated for the Cyprus population. 

This value is by a factor of two lower than the corresponding worldwide mean value(1) 

(1845 µSv y−1).

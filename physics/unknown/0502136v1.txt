Abstract  

A  mechanism  is  explored  whereby  intense  laser  radiation  induces  an  optical  force  between  the 
constituent  atoms  of  a  molecule.    In  the  case  of  a  diatomic  molecule  the  effect  results  in  a  modification  of  the 
vibrational potential, and using perturbation theory it is shown that this reduces the stretching frequency.  Model 
calculations on selected diatomics indicate that the extent of the frequency shift should, under suitable conditions, 
be detectable by Raman spectroscopy.

It  is  a  commonly  exploited  virtue  of  laser 
spectroscopy  that  the  incident  radiation  does  not  in 
general  physically  modify  the  sample.    However,  it 
transpires  that  the  application  of  intense  optical 
radiation  can  induce  a  force  between  neighboring 
their  chemical  bonding  and 
atoms,  modifying 
producing  measurable  changes  in  the  vibrational 
spectrum.    Specifically  an  energy  shift  results  from 
the engagement of two atoms, coupled by a dynamic 
dipolar interaction, in collective forward scattering of 
laser  light.    Through  detailed  analysis  of  a  diatomic 
system,  the  aim  of  this  Letter  is  to  demonstrate  that 
the  associated  force,  induced  by  the  presence  of 
intense  optical  radiation,  is  attractive.    Moreover  it 
can result in a shift of the vibrational frequency that 
is above the limit of experimental detection.   

 
Cooperative  (pairwise)  stimulated  scattering  of 
light is a process that operates for any pair of bonded 
atoms, AB, within a larger molecule.  For simplicity 
the  theory  of  the  corresponding  optically  induced 
force  is  to  be  developed  here  specifically  for  a 
diatomic  molecule.    In  order  to  develop  tractable 
expressions for this system, it is expedient to treat the 
force-generating  mechanism  in  terms  of  optical 
interactions with the individual atoms of the diatomic 
–  justified  on  the  basis  that  electrons  involved  in 
bonding  cannot  contribute  to  such  a  mechanism.  
Since 
(QED) 
description  of  electromagnetic  coupling  with  the 
radiation field includes a summation over all charges 
in the molecule, the non-bonding charge interactions 
are  separable  into  two  terms,  one  describing  the 
interaction  of  atom  A  with  the  radiation  field,  the 
other  the  interaction  of  atom  B.    Fourth-order

dominant 
contribution  to  the  mechanism;  overall  there  are  24 
time-orderings,  one  of  which  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  
Here,  the  annihilation  of  a  photon  from  the  laser 
radiation mode at one atom promotes an interatomic 
transfer  of  energy  resulting  in  the  emission  of  a 
photon, by the second atom, back into the throughput 
radiation  mode.    It  is  of  interest  to  note  that  this 
mechanism  is  applicable  to  any  pair  of  polarisable 
particles [1-8].  In the present context, the separation 
of  the  constituent  particles  is  sufficiently  small  to 
allow  the  retarded  electric  dipole/electric  dipole 
interaction  potential  to  be  represented  by  its  near-
zone limit.  As shown in detail elsewhere [8, 9], the 
energy associated with stimulated forward scattering 
by  the  atom  pair,  assuming  the  molecule  tumbles 
freely in the throughput laser beam, is;

Aα′  and

laser  light  and  R  the  atomic  separation.    The 
associated  classical  force  (-d∆E/dR)  also  acquires  a 
negative  sign, 
thereby  signifying  an  attractive 
interaction.    Quantum  mechanically,  the  potential 
represented  by  equation  (1)  can  be  considered  as 
effecting  perturbations  on  the  wavefunctions  of  a 
simple harmonic oscillator.

the magnitude depending on the vibrational quantum 
number n.  Since κ is negative, this result invariably 
signifies a radiation-induced reduction in bond length 
even for n = 0, consistent with the attractive nature of 
a corresponding classical force. Although, intuitively, 
an attractive force would be expected to increase the 
vibrational 
frequency,  Fig.  2  shows  how  a 
modification  of  the  simple  harmonic  potential  well, 
through the laser-induced interaction potential, forms 
a  new  and  slightly  broader  potential  well  with 
quantum  levels  of  correspondingly  slightly  lower 
energy.

Before proceeding to an evaluation based on the 
above  theory,  certain  assumptions  in  the  model 
calculations  invite  comment.    First,  although  the 
reduction  in  equilibrium  bond  length  has  not  been 
taken  into  account  in  evaluating  frequency  shifts; 
calculations  based  on  equation  (7)  suggest  that  the 
ground state bond length is typically reduced by less 
than  0.01%  of  its  unperturbed  value,  even  at  an 
10  W m .  Secondly, whereas 
applied irradiance of 
the dynamic polarizabilities depend on the frequency 
of  the  radiation  field,  static  polarizabilities  are  more 
the 
readily  available  and  have  been  used 
calculations. 
atom 
polarizabilities  is  a  good  approximation,  especially 
for  large  atoms,  a  more  precise  result  would  be 
obtainable  by  summing 
the 
electromagnetic field to each individual charge in the 
molecule;  this  avenue  of  development  is  currently 
under investigation.

reference materials [11, 12], and a pulse intensity of 
10  W m   was  chosen  –  a  level  readily  achievable 
from  a  standard  femtosecond  laser,  but  not  high 
enough  to produce dissociation.    In  passing  we  note 
that  the  use  of  pulsed  laser  light  in  no  way 
undermines the phenomenon of interest, because the 
vibrational  frequency  measurements  are  made  only 
while  the  light  is  present.    Also,  even  when  such 
pulses  are  short  compared  with  the  vibrational 
period, the usual Born-Oppenheimer rules apply, i.e. 
nuclear  motion  responds  essentially  instantaneously 
to the (laser-modified) electronic environment.   

 
Raman  spectroscopy  appears  to  afford  the  ideal 
technique  for  experimental  verification  of 
the 
vibrational  shifts  predicted  under  high-irradiance 
conditions.    Both  homonuclear  and  heteronuclear 
diatomic  vibrations  are  Raman-active,  and  therefore 
it  is  possible  for  the  same  laser  to  be  used  both  to 
induce  the  frequency  shift  and  to  measure  it.    With 
current  dispersive 
and  high-
resolution  measurement  techniques,  it  is  practicable 
to  achieve  a  resolution  of  0.04  cm-1  [13].    On 
comparison  with  the  results given  in  Table  I,  it  thus 
transpires that although the wavenumber shift will be 
too  small  to  detect  in  the  case  of  the  diatomic 
halogens;  the  shifts  for  hydrogen  halides  are  at  or 
above  the  detection  threshold,  and  in  the  case  of 
hydrogen the shift should be readily measurable.   

instrumentation 

 
In  conclusion  we  observe  that  the  use  of 
ultrashort laser pulses signifies pulse durations which 
may in some cases prove to be similar in magnitude 
to  the  vibrational  period,  100  fs  corresponding  to  a 
vibrational  wavenumber  of  300  cm-1  for  example.  
There  is  scope  to  explore  in  future  work  the 
dynamical  aspects  of  the  laser-induced  frequency 
shift that has been identified.

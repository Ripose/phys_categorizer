Abstract

Special relativistic effects occur only  on  post  accelerated  frames,  which

are frames, which were accelerated in the past to reach a certain uniform

velocity before the measurement of these effects. A symmetry breaking in

special  relativity  is  then  obtained.  The  non-symmetrical  equations  for

space time, length and charge density are presented.

Introduction

As it is known Einstein [1] used the Lorentz transformations in his special theory of

relativity by denying the existence of a privileged  frame. Lorentz [2], Ives [3], Builder

[4], Caruso [5] and Marinov [6] obtained the Lorentz transformations by affirming the

existence of a privileged  frame.

When trying to explain the existence of a privileged inertial reference frame they came

with indefinite explanations like motion with respect to distant matter or the existence

of  ether.  In  this  paper  we  present  a  clear  definite  mathematically  formulated

explanation  for  the  distinction  of  a  privileged  inertial  frame  and  for  the  cause  of

special relativistic effects. We find that special relativistic effects occur only in frames

which were accelerated to reach the uniform velocity v,and then continue to move with

uniform velocity V. The frame which did not accelerate and its velocity is viewed to be

v by viewing from the other frame, is the privileged inertial frame.

II.  Physical Descriptions

 Consider  a  rod  moving  with  velocity  V  relative  to  an  inertial  frame.    The  rod

 

emits  two  light  pulses  simultaneously  from  its  edges,  perpendicular  to  the

inertial frame below it.  Let x'1 and x'2 be the coordinates of the two edges in the

reference frame, and x1, x2 the coordinates in the inertial frame,

 Two measuring rods A, B with equal lengths at rest, move with velocity V toward each

other.  Rods A and B are parallel with infinitesimal vertical distance h between them

as illustrated in Fig. 1.

 

 

 FIG. 1.   (a) Rod B moves at velocity V, rod A is at rest.  (b) Rod A regarded as
 Moving at velocity -V relative to B which is at rest in its reference frame.

 When the front of the two rods overlap two laser pulses are emitted from the two edges

of  rod  B  to  make  marks  on  rod  A.    If  the  two  pulses  are  emitted  at  the  same  time,

which can be arranged by calculating the overlapping point, they will arrive at rod B at

the  same  time  because  they  both  travel  distance  h  and  the  rods  have  no  vertical

velocity.  A is at rest and B moves at velocity V,

 one  point  would  be  marked  on  rod  A.  We  see  there  are  two  different

physical results for the same space time event, which infers a contradiction,

which  can  be  solved  by  looking  at  the  rods  later  and  counting  how  many

points  were  marked  on 

the  rod  A.  This  solves 

the  problem  of

simultaneously  measurement  of  two  moving  frames  Caruso  raised  in  his

paper.  The  contradiction  occurs  because  we  use  the  special  relativistic

postulation that states that there is symmetry or the same special relativistic

effects,  on  two  frames  that  move  with  velocity  V  relative  to  each  other.

Namely, there is symmetry if we define A to be at rest and B to move with

velocity V relative to A or if we define B to be at rest and A to move with

velocity  -V  relative  to  B.  This  argument  leads  us  to  the  contradiction.  In

 6



order  to  solve  the  contradiction  we  need  to  find  a  difference  between  the

two frames A and B. The difference we have found is that only one frame

accelerated  to  reach  velocity  V.  When  the  velocity  is  reached,  the  frame

stops  accelerating  and  continues  to  move  at  a  uniform  velocity  V.  In  the

first stage both frames A and B are at rest or move at the same velocity. In

order to achieve the relative velocity V between A and B one frame has to

accelerate until it reaches a relative velocity V compared to the other frame

and  then  stops  accelerating.  The  frame  then  continue  to  move  in  uniform

velocity V relative to the other frame. Special relativistic effects occur only

in the frame which accelerated before reaching velocity V. This solves the

contradiction of different physical results during the same space time event.

 When  frame  A  moves  at  a  relative  velocity  compared  to  frame  B  we  know  that  A

accelerated  in  an  event  in  the  past  in  order  to  reach  uniform  velocity  V  relative  to

frame B. On the other hand, in the same situation when assuming frame A is at rest

and  frame  B  moves  at  velocity  -V  relative  to  A  we  know  that  frame  B  did  not

accelerate  and  its  velocity  is  only  a  point  of  view  from  frame  A.  Frame  A  which

accelerated in the past is the only frame which has special relativistic effects. The term

post acceleration refers to the frame after the acceleration, frame which at the time of

the observation moves at uniform velocity V but at some time range in the past before

the observation, had accelerated, until it reached the uniform velocity V, then stopped

accelerating and continued to move at uniform velocity V.

 where  a(t)  is  the  time  dependent  acceleration,  t1  is  the  time  the  body

accelerated  to  reaches  velocity  V.    Now  the  clock  which  is  considered  to

move at velocity V is the clock which accelerated from rest to velocity V.

The  special  relativistic  effects  are  derived  from  the  acceleration  which

brought the system to the uniform velocity V. This phenomenon is different

than  the  acceleration  influence  on  relativistic  effects  at  the  moment  of

acceleration [7,8].

We  obtain  a  symmetry  breaking  in  special  relativity.  There  is  no  similarity  or

symmetry between the description of frame s being at rest as an inertial frame with

Frame s' moving  at a uniform velocity V as a reference frame, and the description of

frame s'  being at rest as an inertial frame and s moving at -V as a  reference  frame.

The set of Special relativity equations [1] for frame s' as an inertial and s frame as  a

reference frame with velocity exchange from v to -v is invalid. There is only one set of

equations as obtained in Eq. (13) or Eq. (14), which includes both cases.

IV.  Rods measurement at different frames

In  this  section  we  discuss  the  relativistic  effects  on  rod's  measurement  at  different

frames.Consider a case where a rod is at rest along the x' axis of the s' frame.It's edge

points are measured to be x'1 and x'2   so that its length in the s' frame is  x'2-x'1=D x'.

The rod length as measured by the s frame for which the rod moves at a relative speed

V is

We can identify D x as the length of the rod in the s frame if the positions x2 and x1 of

the edges'  point of the rod are measured in the same time.Thus,with  D

Suggested applicable experiment using Mossbauer effect.

Because  of  the  small  natural  width  of  high  frequency  g

 radiation,  Mossbauer  effect
[10]  is  an  excellent  tool  to  verify  relativistic  effects.  The  following  experiment  is

suggested.

(a) A  source  of    rays  moves  in  a  straight  line  in  a  constant  velocity.  The  absorber

absorbs  rays emitted perpendicular to the source cement.

(b) An absorber of  rays moves in a straight line. The absorber absorbs  rays emitted

perpendicular from stationary source.

On the first measurement, the source of   rays moves in a straight line. The absorber

absorbs  the    rays  emitted  perpendicular  to  the  source  movements.  On  the  second

measurement the absorber of  rays moves in a straight line. The absorber absorbs the

 rays emitted perpendicular from stationary source.According to Einstein's special

 relativity,  on  both  cases  it  is  predicted  to  measure  a  frequency  red  shift,  due  to

transverse Doppler effect.

According to our theory, in the first case the measured frequency is the same as in

Einstein's theory because the source accelerated before reaching the velocity V.in the

 second  case,  our  theory  predicted  a  blue  shift.  In  this  case  the  absorber  accelerated

before reaching velocity V, which according to Eq. (13a) causes a time dilation, which

is interpreted as a red shift in the natural width of the absorber. The source  was  not

accelerated though according to Eq. (13a) there is no time dilation or frequency shift in

its  natural  width.  Therefore,    rays  from  the  source  measured  at  the  absorber,  will

D



appear to be blue shifted. This phenomenon has not been noticed before, since in the

former experiment like Pound's and Rebka's [10],the source always moved and the

 absorber was stationary.

In summary, the relativistic effects of special relativity occur only on post accelerated

systems, i.e. systems that accelerated to reach the uniform velocity in which they are

moving  at  the  time  of  the  measurement.  We  obtained  symmetry  breaking  in  special

relativity.  There  is  only  one  set  of  relativistic  equations  for  systems  with  velocity  v.

There is no second set of relativistic equations for exchanging the frame of reference

with the inertial frame and considering it to have velocity -v .

A  rod  at  rest  in  the  inertial  frame  when  observed  from  a  reference  frame,  and

compared to the reference frame, as if the inertial frame moves at velocity -v, would

not be contracted as stated in the standard special relativity, but it would be measured

to expand.

The density of charge in inertial frame measured by reference frame was found to be

reduced, contrary to standard special relativity equations.

This  approach  to  the  theory  of  special  relativity  is  similar  to  the  general  theory  of

relativity where the relativistic effects are determined absolutely by potentials.

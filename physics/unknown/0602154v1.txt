Transformation of equations in analysis 

 of proportionality through referent models. 

Enrique Ordaz Romay1

Abstract 

In proportionality of objects, samples or populations, usually we work with Z score of 

proportionality calculated through referent models, instead directly with the variables of the 

objects in itself. In these studies we have the necessity to transform, the equations that use the 

variables of the object, in equations that directly use like variables Z score. 

In the present work a method is developed to transform the parametric equations, in 

equations  in  variables  Z  using  like  example  the  studies  of  human  proportionality  from  the 

Phantom stratagem of Ross and Wilson. 

Introduction 

The  study  of  the  proportionality  of  objects,  samples  or  populations  usually  is 

approached  from  the  analysis  of  Z  score  calculated  from  a  model  referent,  from  the 

expression:

being i the subject of study, P the referent model, variable1 the study variable, variable2 the 

proportionality  base,  n  =  n1/n2  being  n1  and  n2  the  dimensions  of  variable1  and  variable2 

respectively and svariable1 the standard deviation of  variable1.

Transformation of equations in analysis of proportionality through referent models. 

The  referent  model  will  be  an  ideal  model  of  object  that  is  used  like  standard  of 

proportionality measurement.  Times it will be a model formed by statistical averages, other 

times  a  comfortable  mathematical  model  or  useful  to  even  facilitate  the  calculations  and  in 

some cases, the models will be established like canons of some specific quality. 

Let  us  suppose  that  we  used,  as  standard,  the  parameters  of  a  sample.  In  these 

conditions, if the distribution of the variables of the sample is a normal distribution, referent 

will be defined by a table that contains the values of the averages and standard deviations of 

the different variables from the sample.  That is to say, referent model P will be defined by 

table 1.

For  example:    In  the  studies  of  human  proportionality,  Ross  and  Wilson  in  1974 

defined  a  proportionality  standard  to  which  they  called  “Phantom”  model  so  that  it  served 

like reference. The calculation of the values corresponding to the kinanthropometric variables 

of  the  Phantom  model  was  based  on  extensive  data  bases  of  general  population.  The 

perimeters were obtained from the data base of Wilmore and Behnke in 1969 and 1970, the 

skinfolds from a data base not published of Yuhasz (Carter, 1996) and the rest of measures 

was obtained by Garret and the Kennedys in 1971. The result of these works lead until the 

table of the Phantom reference model.

That  it  is  deduced  from  equation  (1)  replacing  variable2  by  stature  and  the  referent

proportionality, is inherent part of the Phantom method gets used to omitting this subscript. 

Parametric equations and Z score equations. 

We  will  call  parametric  equation  to  that  equation  whose  result  is  obtained  by  direct 

substitution of the study object values in the variables of the equation.  Its traditional form, 

being x1(i), x2(i), …, xm(i) the values of our study object i (object o sample), will be: 

For example, in kinanthropometry, for the calculation of the fat mass percentage, one 

of the equations that are used is: 

f (x1(i), x2(i), …, xm(i))

In this equation, they are used, like variables for the calculation of the percentage of

On  the  other  hand,  we  will  call  Z  score  equation  to  any  equation  whose  result  is 

obtained  by  substitution  (not  of  the  direct  values)  of  Z  score  of  the  study  object 

proportionality in the variables of the equation.  To this Z score function will have the form:

The  equations  of  the  last  type  are  not  easily  in  the  bibliography,  but  they  are  not 

difficult  to  deduce.    Let  us  see  the  process  exemplifying  it  with  the  calculation  of  the 

ponderal index (PI) based on its Z scores. The equation of the PI is:

That is to say, PI is, traditionally and by definition, a parametric function of two direct 

variables:  height and weight. 

The  form  to  obtain  the  equation  in  Z  score  from  the  parametric  equation  (3)  is, 

outline, simple.  In the first place we cleared variable(i) of the equation (2) obtaining:

Replacing this expression in the parametric equation we obtain as result the equation 

in Z score. In the case of PI the equation (4), for variable = weight and knowing that, in the 

Phantom  model  of  human  proportionality  weight(Ph)  =  64,58  kg,  sweight(Ph)  =  8,60  kg  and 

that the weight has dimension n = 3 is:

To replace the equation (4) in the expression of the parametric equation for obtain the

Transformation of equations in analysis of proportionality through referent models. 

the  necessities  which  arise  when  we  considered  the  transformation  of  equations  in  the 

analysis of the proportionality. 

The circumstances in which the search of the equation in Z scores takes place are the 

following ones: 

•  A  form  simple  is  needed  (preferably  linear)  to  evaluate,  by  means  of  Z  scores,  a 

parameter that traditionally calculates through a parametric expression. 

•  We know that, when Z scores of the variables involved in the parametric equation are 

zero, the parameter calculated with this equation agrees proportionally with the value 

of those same parameters in the referent model. 

•  We also know that, in general, the referent models (universal or particular) are used in 

proportionality so that Z score has small values near zero.  In fact, great values for Z 

score, more than disproportions in the study objects, indicate in many occasions, the 

inadequate of the referent model to this concrete study. 

Evidently,  the  terms  "small"  and  "great"  are  very  subjective  and  will  depend  on  the 

objectives  of  the  project  or  study.    Nevertheless,  generally,  these  terms  can  be  done 

objectives from the set of the work of investigation, using the significance level (p-value) of 

the study, that is to say, the precision of the study.  The form consists of defining "small" Z 
score when.2

For example, using like referent the model of human proportionality Phantom, for the 

variable weight (vweight(Ph) = 64.58 kg and sweight(Ph) = 8.60 kg) with p < 0.01, the acceptable 
value for Zpeso must be smaller than 64.59/8.60 + ln(0,01) ≈ 2.90. That is to say, if Zweight(i) score,  

in one individual i, is smaller than 2.90 the Phantom model of human proportionality can be 

applied to this individual i with a significance level p < 0.01. 
                                                           
2 An estimation of Z takes form Z = Zestimate  – ε, being ε the relative error that is committed with the estimation. 
In first approach, the precision p is proportional to the exponent of the minus relative error (p ~ e-ε) and Z must 
be of the order or smaller than variable(P)/s(P), replacing and clearing Zestimate the expression (5) is obtained.

Thus, (7) will be the equation looked for the calculation of parameter f from Z score. 

We will call to this equation SZSE (simplified in Z score equation).  The values of the Cf,x 

coefficients can easily be found by differential calculus for each equation or be deduced by 

numerical analysis.  For f equations that are linear in their variables (as those of Faulkner or 

Yuhasz), the coefficients that multiplies to the variables in the parametric equation agree with 

these coefficients. 

The physical meaning of the equation (7) is immediate: 

• 

If all Z scores of the variables that take part in the calculation of a parameter are equal 

to zero, such parameter adopts the proportional value of the referent model. 

•  A  value  of  an  Z  score  different  from  zero  increases  or  diminishes  the  parameter 

respect the referent value, with a “weight” of Cf,x·sx(Ph). 

• 

In general, in the Z score equation, the base of the proportionality (the stature in the 

Phantom  model),  takes  part  in  the  calculation  of  the  parameter  although  it  does  not 

appear in the parametric equation.

It  is  simple  to  calculate  these  values:  the  parameter  PI  and  their  equation  are 

dimensionless, therefore n = 0. Also a simple substitution makes us see that in the Phantom 

method of human proportionality Zheight score is always equal to zero. 

 
By substitution of values we calculated PI(Ph) = 170.18 /(64.58)1/3  ≈ 42.41 and with 

a consultation to the table of the Phantom model is obtained sweight(Ph) = 8.60 cm.

In  order  to  see  the  differences  between  these  two  equations  we  calculated  the 

minimum p-value of a study for different values from stature obtaining table 3.

It is easy to verify that, indeed, for values of height small and high weight the Zweight 

indices are great and let fulfill the condition (5). For this reason, the values that better fit both 

equations (parametric and SZSE) are, for this particular case those that they fulfill |Zweight| < 4. 

In summary, we have two equations for the ponderal index:

•  Z score equation:       PI(Z(i)) ≈  42.41 – 1.88·Zweight (i) 

The  first  equation  is  the  parametric  traditional  one,  the  second  one  is  used  in 

proportionality when |Zweight| < 4. 

2. SZSE for Faulkner fat mass percentage. 

The equation of Faulkner fat mass percentage is a lineal equation in all of its variables 

and the coefficient that multiplies them is the same one for all of them: 0.153.  

Let us calculate the values to replace in the equation (7): the percentage of fat mass is 

a  dimensionless  parameter,  that  is  to  say,  n  =  0.  Also,  the  percentage  of  fat  mass  of  the 

Phantom  model  (calculated  using  the  formula  of  Faulkner)  is  18.79%.  Finally,  all  the 

CFaulkner,x take the value from 0.153 in all the variable. Consequently, the equation (7) we have 

left:

Proposing  an  example:    If  an  individual  i  has  a  height  of  168  cm  and  values  of 

ZTriceps(i)= –1.2 ; ZSubscapula(i)= 0.1 ; ZSuprailiac(i)= –0.4 and ZAbdominal(i)= 0.2, the calculation of 

its percentage of fat mass will be the corresponding one to table 5 for (4).

Transformation of equations in analysis of proportionality through referent models. 

Applying the equation (3) with n = –1 the result is: 

%Masa grasa(i) ≈ 18,79 – 0,78 = 18,01 % 

It  agrees  to  observe  that  the  difference,  between  the  results  of  the  fat  mass  of  the 

Faulkner parametric equation and the Z score equation  is zero when the height of i is the one 

of  Phantom.  Nevertheless,  although  in  the  Faulkner  parametric  equation  of  the  height  does 

not  take  part,  it  takes  part  in  the  SZSE  from  Faulkner  one  (though  Z  scores).  This  fact  is 

excellent  because  it  corrects  one  of  the  defects  of  the  Faulkner  equation:  It  is  anatomically 

evident that if two individuals have equal skin-fold, the taller will have a smaller percentage 

of the fat than the lowest. This data is not had in account in the Faulkner equation, but it is 

contemplated in the equation derived from the proportionality because in the taller the Z sores 

are smaller than the lowers then the skin-folds are equal in both. 

3. SZSE for Yuhasz fat mass percentage 

Very similar to the Faulkner equations are the equations of the percentage of Yuhasz 

fat mass. These differentiate between men and women, include two skin-fold more (thigh and 

leg) and changes the coefficients of the variables.  Nevertheless, the equations are linear, too.  

In this form, the two SZSE of the percentage of Yuhasz fat mass, are:

4. SZSE for Von Döbeln bony mass modified by Rocha. 

Another example would be the calculation of the Von Döbeln bony mass equation of 

modified by Rocha. In the first place we will calculate the value of the explaining n for the 

equation  (9):  The  bony  mass,  like  all  the  masses,  has  dimension  =  3.  Nevertheless,  the 

equation  of  Von  Döbeln  is  not  exactly  3,  but  it  has  the  product  of  three  variables  with 

- 13 - 

Transformation of equations in analysis of proportionality through referent models. 

dimension  =  1,  one  of  them  elevated  to  the  square,  and  all  with  exponent  0.712.  This 

corresponds to a dimension (2+1+1)·0.712=2.848, value very near, although different from 3. 
That is to say, the dimensions of the bony mass are different by parameter and by equation3. 

Therefore, n will be an intermediate value between both.  We will have then: 2.848 < n < 3. 

As election we take the average from these two values: (3+2.848)/2 = 2.924. 

On the other hand, Coefficientheight is not necessary to calculate it, because we know 

that Zheight in the Phantom method is always equal to zero.  This does not mean that the height 

does not contribute to the bony mass in the SZSE derived from the one from Von Döbeln, but 

that its contribution is including in being of the explaining n.  

The  rest  of  coefficients  are  calculated  by  analysis  differential  and  their  results  are 

Coefficientd.styloid = 1.4341 and Coefficientd.bicondileo = 0.7848. Multiplying these values by the 

respective  standard  deviations  we  calculated  the  numbers  that  multiply  to  Z  scores.  Like 

sd.styloid = 0.28 cm and sd.bicondileo = 0.48 cm, the equation we have left:

Applying  it  to  a  example:  Let  an  individual  i  with  height  =  1.88  m,  who  has  the 

values: Zd.styloid(i)= 1.3 ; Zd.bicondileo femur(i)= 1.7. Its Von Döbeln bony mass will be (table 6) :

Using the equation (7) the result is: 

                                                           
3 It could seem that in the case of Faulkner or Yuhasz formulas it happen the same, nevertheless, in both cases 
the  equations  have  an  independent  term  that  “assumes”  the  dimensional  difference  and  for  that  reason  it 
facilitates that such equations depend on the height through Z scores.

Bony mass(i)  ≈ (10.49 + 1.16)·(188/170.18)2.924 = 15.59 Kg 

It  is  possible  to  emphasize  that  the  difference  between  using  the  equation  of  Von 

Döbeln and the derived one from indices Z is inferior to 1% when Z scores are included in the 

interval (-4, 4).

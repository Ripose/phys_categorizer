FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS OF DUST GRAIN ORBITAL BEHAVIOR AROUND NEPTUNE. R. Naz-
zario and T. W. Hyde, Center for Astrophysics, Space Physics and Engineering Research, Baylor University, Waco,

Introduction:    The  time-scale  for  the  formation
lifetime of Neptune's  rings  is  on  the  order of  millions
of  years.    Most  current  theories  suggest  the  dust  in
these  rings  is  a  result  of  collisional  processes  [1-3].
This  paper advances current investigations  by  tracking
the  orbital  behavior  of  individual  dust  grains  around
Neptune while  under the  influence of  a  detailed  mag-
netic  field  model.    Dust  grain  orbital  evolution  is
compiled  for dust  ejected from  one  of  the  three  inner
moons with comparisons  drawn to  previous  efforts [1-
10].

Model:   It  is  reasonable to  assume  that  impactors
on  Neptune’s moons  eject dust  particles  in  much  the
same manner as  previously  observed for the  moons  of
Jupiter and Earth.  For Jupiter,  such  ejected dust  parti-
cles have both  a  size and  velocity  distribution,  which
has  not  yet  been  measured  and  as  such,  is  not  well
known.    As  a  result,  this  work  tracks  the  orbits  for
individual  ejecta, assuming  an  initial  random velocity
for each particle.  The  size  of  each  dust  grain  is  also
randomly selected to  fall  in  the  regime between 7  and
7000  µm  in  radius.    The  orbital  parameters  for  each
grain  are  calculated  while  taking  into  account  Nep-
tune’s gravitational force (where both  the  spherical and
oblate  field  expansion terms  are considered), the  solar
radiation  pressure  force,  the  solar  gravitational  force,
the gravitational  fields  produced by  Neptune’s moons,
and  (for charged grains) the  interaction with  the  mag-
netic field of Neptune.  This  allows  a  determination of
the dust particle’s  dynamics  using  a  force equation  for
the particle, given as

In  Eq.  (1),  G  is  the  gravitational constant,  Mn  is  the
mass of Neptune, md is the mass of the dust grain, r  is
the distance from the center of Neptune to  the  position
of  the  particle,  ˆr   is  the  unit  vector  from  Neptune  to
the  particle,  Msun  is  the  mass  of  the  Sun,  R  is  the
distance from  the  Sun  to  the  particle,  and  ˆR   is  the

unit  vector from  the  Sun  to  the  dust  particle  for  the
v
ρ
radiation pressure force.  In  the  second to  last  term,    
is the position vector from the Sun to Neptune [11].  
     The  first  term  on  the  right  hand  side  of  Eq.  (1)
represents the  gravitational attraction  on  the  grain  as-
suming  a  spherical  Neptune  [12].    The  second  term
corrects this to  include  an  oblateness term  (J2) for the
Neptunian  gravitational  field  where  θ  is  the  angle
measured  from  Neptune’s  rotational  axis.    The  third
term  describes the  radiation  pressure  force  due  to  the
solar  radiation  incident  upon  the  particle  with  β  de-
fined as the ratio of the solar radiation pressure force to
the solar gravitational force [13]. β is calculated using

where Q is the radiation pressure efficiency (taken to be
1.0 for particles with radii larger than 1 µm), a is the
radius of the particle (between 1 µm and 100 µm as
specified earlier), and ρ is the density of the particle
(assumed to be 1.4 g/cm3).  The final term in equation
(1) takes into account the interaction of the magnetic
field on a charged particle whereφ is the potential of
v
v  is
the grain, 
the velocity of the dust grain relative to the magnetic
ε
o  is the permittivity of free space.  The
field and

magnetic field (

oped by Holme and Bloxham [14] where

v

To insure accurate results, a planetary shadowing  effect
was  taken  into  account  whenever  the  particle  moved
behind  Neptune.    Additionally,  the  planet’s orbit  was
taken to be elliptical  in  order to  achieve a  more realis-
tic radiation pressure calculation.  A  fifth  order Runge-
Kutta method  was employed  for all  numerical simula-
tions.

Results:    Each simulation  initially  assumed  a  ran-
dom velocity of up to  500  m/s  for the  dust  particle as
measured  relative  to  the  parent  body.    This  velocity
distribution was  selected due  to  experimental hyperve-
locity  impact  data  showing  that  most  such  ejecta  is

created by  low  impact  velocities.    The initial  distance
from the surface of  the  grain’s progenitor (Naiad, Tha-
lassa  or  Despina) is  taken to  be  1000  m.    The  grains
are launched into the shadow of Neptune with  the  Sun,
Neptune  and  its  moons  initially  aligned  along  the
same axis.    The potential  on  each  particle  was  varied
between –3.0  V  (to  simulate  grains  exposed  to  solar
radiation)  and  -18.0  V  (for  particle's  in  Neptune’s
shadow).  A size range of particles was studied using  β
values from  0.001  to  0.1  with  a  step  size  of  0.001.
Particle  ejection  speeds  of  5.0,  50.0  and  500.0  m/s
were assumed.    Nine  random  impacts  were  simulated
on each moon  (for a  total  of  2700  particles) with  each
simulation  allowed  to  run  for  10  years.

Conclusions:  In  all  cases,  the  orbital  motion  of
the  dust  particles  followed  extremely  complicated
paths. As can be seen in Figure (1),  for grains  released
from  Naiad particles across  the  size  regime  (all  ejec-
tion speeds) survived for the entire ten-year period.    In
the  case of  Thalassa (Figure  2),  1309  of  2700  grains
released survived  the  ten-year period with  all  ejection
ranges represented. For particles released from  Despina
(Figure 3), only  those  grains  with  initial  velocities  of
500 m/s or  greater survived  for more than  1  year. All
others  quickly  impacted Despina.    Discussion  of  the
above results  (along with  several additional  data sets)
will be presented. Correlations with the  orbital  proper-
ties  of  the  known  rings  of  Neptune  will  also  be  ex-
plored.

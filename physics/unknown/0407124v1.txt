The  energy-balance  model  of  global  climate,  which  is  taking  into  account  a  nontrivial  role  of 

solar  and  galactic  protons,  is  presented.  The  model  is  described  by  the  equation  of  fold  catastrophe 

relative to increment of temperature, where the variation of a solar insolation and cosmic rays are control 

parameters. It is shown that the bifurcation equation of the model describes one of two stable states of the 

climate system. The solution of this equation exhibits the property of the determined bistable behavior of 

climate at the global level and the possibility of appearance of the determined chaos of “the weathers” at 

the local levels.  

The results of the comparative analysis of the computer simulation of the time-dependent solution 

of  energy-balance  model  of  global  climate  and  the  oxygen  isotope  records  for  deep-sea  core  V28-238 

over the past 730 kyr are presented, and the evolution of climate on 100 kyr forward is also predicted.    

It is shown that the proposed model successfully explains the nicety of the paleoclimatic records. 

The  model  is  clear  of  all  known  difficulties  of  the  Milankovich  theory  for  the  analysis  and  the 

interpretation of physical mechanism, by which the climate system responds to orbital forcing.

According  to  the  Milankovich  astronomical  theory  of  climate  variations  in  the 
eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit are the  fundamental cause of the succession of Pleistocene ice 
ages [1-3].  

However,  the  Milankovich  theory  not  only  successfully  explains  the  nicety  of  the 
paleoclimatic  records  [4],  but  at  the  same  time  it  is  confronted  by  serious  difficulties  for  the 
analysis and the interpretation of the physical mechanism, by which the climate system responds 
to orbital forcing. At first, the variations of solar heating are sufficiently small to control by the 
climatic  cycles  and  practically  do  not  exhibit  intermediate  (with  period  ~  400  thousand  years) 
and all the more long-time (with period ~ 2.5 million years) modulations, which are concerned 
with the periods of the eccentricity characteristic changes [5,6]. Secondly, the amplitude of one 
of the  prominent  interglacial events, isotope stage 11, has been large at times (around 400 kyr 
ago and today [7]), when the eccentricity modulation has been zero or, that is equivalently, the 
insolation variations are the smallest. This conflict is also called the “ stage-11 problem ” [7]. In 
third,  improved  measurements  have  uncovered  an  apparent  causality  problem:  the  sudden 
termination  of  glacial-interglacial  cycles  appear  to  precede  the  increases  in  insolation  [8].  In 
addition, the Milankovich astronomical theory of climate, explaining Pleistocene ice ages, does 
not  explain  their  absence  in  the  majority  of  other  geological  epochs,  though  the  insolation 
variations similar to the Quaternary, apparently, had a place always [9].  

The  use  of  so  called  "flip-flop  back  and  forth"  mechanism  to  set  up  the  models  of 
climatic response to orbital variation [8] was  the first strategic hitch on the path to overcoming 
of  these  difficulties.  The  brightest  implementation of such a strategy  was the  original work on 
stochastic  resonance  by  Benzi  et  al.,  in  which  the  term  was  coined  [10].  The  principal 
manifestation  of  the  phenomenon  is  strong  different  output  characteristics  of  the  system  to  a 
weak periodic signal; this reaction grows with increasing of the noise level up to certain extent. 
The main results point to the possibility of explaining large amplitude, long-term alternations of 
temperature  by  means  of  a  co-operation  between  small external periodic  forcing due to orbital 
variations (about 0.1 % of the solar constant) and an internal stochastic mechanism (for example, 
a  white  noise,  which  simulates  the  global  effect  of  relatively  short-term  fluctuations  in  the 
atmospheric  and  oceanic  circulations  on  the  long-term  temperature  behavior  [10]).  Note  that 
similar results have been obtained by Nicolis [11] using a different approach. 

The  original  work  on  deterministic  transitions  in  multi-state  climate  model  by  Paillard 
[13] is the alternate branching of "flip-flop"-strategy application. In this work it is supposed that 
depending  on  the  insolation  forcing  and  the  ice  volume,  the  climate  system  can  enter  three 
different  regimes  called  i  (interglacial),  g  (mild  glacial)  and  G  (full  glacial),  between  which 
phase  transitions  in  i-g-G-i  direction  take  place  at  given  boundary  conditions.  The  three-state 
model is not vary sensitive to the initial conditions and can be a good candidate to explain some 
puzzling  features  of  the  Quaternary  records,  in  particular  the  “100  kyr  problem”  as  well  as 
“stage-11  problem”  [13].  This  work  grows  out  of  the  generalization  of  successful  ideas  and 
achievements,  which  were  obtained  during  the  difficult,  but  effective  development  of  “ice-
volume” models of climatic response to orbital variation by Calder [14], Weertman [15], Paillard 
[16] and Imbrie J.-Imbrie J.Z. [8]. 

But it is necessary to note, that despite the reached progress in the description of multi-
state  climate,  the  general  disadvantage  of  the  works  of  “flip-flop”-direction  is  the  fact  that  the 

stable states of the earth's climatic system [10,13] and transitions between them [13], figuratively 
speaking, "are set by hands”. 

In  this  sense  Sellers-Byduko-type  models  (so-called  heat-budget  direction  [17-19]),  in 
which  was  made  a  preliminary  attempt  verifying  the  Milankovich  theory  using  a  zonally 
symmetric energy-balance climate model forced with seasonally varying insolation (as function 
of latitude and time of year) and obtain generally favourable results [20, 21], are no exception.  

We consider that all problems of the modern energy-balance climate models caused by 
the necessity to use strong assumptions are the direct consequence of the traditional neglect of 
the  role  of  the  cosmophysical  factors  in  the  formation  of  global  climate  of  the  Earth  (in 
particular, the influence of solar and galactic cosmic rays (GCR) on climate).  

The opponents of the account of the solar activity influence on meteoparameters raise the 
objections,  which  have  energy  nature.  The  atmospheric  processes  are  characterized  by  power 
about  1026-1027  erg/day.  At  the  same  time  the  energy  entry  from  the  solar  wind  to  the 
magnetosphere and the subsequent processes in the magnetosphere and the ionosphere is about 
1023 erg/day. It is less than the power of real atmospheric processes on 3-4 orders. Therefore, the 
typical and settled conclusion follows: " … the relative contribution from cosmic rays to the flow 
of  solar  radiation  is  very  small  and  they    do  not    directly  cause  any  essential  variations  of  the 
weather  and  climate.  And  so,  there  is  no  wonder  that  variations  with  the  period  of  solar  cycle 
about 11.5 years are not observed in the spectra of climatic series" [9]. 

However, as it was shown by Pudovkin et al. [22,23], another explanation of considered 
problem  is  possible.  In  spite  of  the  fact  that  the  energy  contribution  from  solar  and  galactic 
cosmic  rays  is  not  comparable  with  the  value  of  solar  insolation,  they  effectively  influence  on 
physico-chemical  processes  in  the  atmosphere  by  the  stimulation  of  nitrogen  and  hydrogenous 
cycles  of  physico-chemical  reactions  and  considerably  change 
the  optical  properties 
(transparency) of the atmosphere. It means, that the variations of cosmic rays play a part of the 
peculiar physical modulator of additional solar energy incoming to the lower atmosphere. Long 
correlation experiments and theoretical estimations [22,23] have shown that the additional (solar) 
energy incoming to the atmosphere at change of its transparency due to the perturbation caused 
by  cosmic  rays  has  approximately  same  value  as  the  energy  of  processes  exited  in  the 
atmosphere. The independent data of Raisbeck et al. [24], which indicate a high correlation score 
in  time  between  the  concentration  of  cosmic  beryllium  (10Be)  accumulated  in  ice  and  the 
concentration of heavy isotope of oxygen (δ18О) in ice core obtained at the station "Vostoc" (the 
specific analog of paleotemperature), can serve as an illustration to above said (Fig. 1). Thus, the 
account of the additional energy caused by the change of the atmosphere transparency results in 
the following energy-balance equation of the Earth climate system (ECS) [25]:

where the first member of Eq. (1) ∆U(T,t) characterizes the additional power of heat generation 
in ECS relative to initial power U0=U − ∆U, W; T is temperature, K; t is the time, for which an 
energy  balance  is  considered;  P(t)  is  the  flux  of  solar  radiation  on  the  upper  bound  of  the

additional flux of solar heat in ECS generated by the flux of galactic and solar cosmic particles, 
W. 

Let  us  express  energy  components  I, 

  and  G  of  this  equation  as  the  function  of

At last, let us consider the problem of the functional dependence of additional heat flux G 
on temperature. It is known that the integral GCR spectrum N(E) is surprising stable and in the 
range of 1011-1015 eV is power-mode:

Let us suppose that the GCR energy is completely absorbed in the atmosphere. Then we 

can estimate the average energy Eg transmitted to atmospheric gas:

production of a gas vortex with size λ, which is inversely proportional to particle energy E, i.e.,

.  
Following Ref. [27], let us replace the scales λ by the corresponding “wave numbers” of 
vortex pulsations in the form of k ~ 1/λ. Then taking into account Eq. (5) the integral spectrum 
Eg of gas vortexes looks like

where Eg(k)dk is the kinetic energy of gas vortex with spatial wave number k. 

Since µ ≈ 5/3, it is obvious that the spectrum (7) is nothing else than known Kolmogorov-
Obukhov spectrum [27,28], which describes the dynamics of high-frequency perturbations or, in 
other  words,  the  structure  of  small-scale  turbulized  medium  in  the  form  of  the  vortex  cluster 
skeleton with fractal dimension D=5/3 [27,28].  

Note that the appropriate laws of similarity, scale correlations and spectral dynamics (in 
particular,  within  the  framework  of  the  inertial  interval  theory  reducing  to  the  Kolmogorov-
Obukhov  vortex  energy  spectrum)  are  traditionally  applied  for  the  simulation  of  atmospheric 
turbulence  in  boundary  layer,  i.e.,  for  the  layer  of  the  air,  within  the  limits  of  which  the 
interaction of the atmosphere and an underlying surface is directly exhibited [28]. 

Hence the obtained Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectrum (7) induced by GCR has differences 
not  only  in  the  reason,  but  also  in  the  main  place  of  its  formation:  the  homosphere-the  upper 
atmosphere. It is necessary to mention here known experimental data [29], which are confirm the 
existence of small-scale turbulence in this area of the atmosphere. On the other hand, if the large-
scale fractal structure (in the form of  the skeleton of vortex cluster) is formed in this area, the 
energy  can  be  output  to  "infinity"  through  it,  i.e.,  the  energy  can  be  output  from  the  area  of 
turbulent  motion,  for  example,  to  the  upper  atmosphere.  Then  the  question  about  what 
experimentally observed consequences may be in this case arises.  

The universal regularities obtained within the frameworks of the inertial interval theory 
(or,  in  other  words,  Kolmogorov-Obukhov  laws  of  similarity  [27,28])  were  developed  by 
Obukhov  for  the  description  of  the  statistical  structure  of  the  temperature  turbulent  pulsations, 
when they do not yet influence essentially on flux structure [30]. Moreover in Ref. [30] it was 
shown that the structure of the temperature field in turbulent conditions is determined not only 
by the dissipation rate of turbulence kinetic energy per mass unit ε, but also by the dissipation 
rate of temperature fluctuation intensity NT, which is equal on order of values:

where ∆u is characteristic size of the scale of the rate of main energy-carrying vortexes; ∆Т is 
characteristic temperature difference in a flux on its external scale L. 

Then it is possible to present the generalized Kolmogorov-Obukhov law, which take into 
account both the turbulent pulsation of  kinetic energy and temperature pulsation, in equivalent 
spectral  (on  space)  form.  Let  EТ(k)dk  is  the  kinetic  energy  of  unit  liquid  mass  contained  in 
pulsations  with  values  k  in  given  interval  dk.  As  the  function  EТ(k)  has  dimension  of  cm3/s2, 
making the combination of this dimensionality from NT, ε and k, we obtain in the inertial interval 
of scales the following expression:

general  form  of  the  dependence  of  heat  flow  GT  in  turbulent  conditions  on  characteristic 
temperature difference (Tout−T) in the flux on its external scale L:   

                                                                     G

Let us remind that in our conception the variations of additional insolation described by 
parameter  g  (W/K2)  are  determined  mainly  by  the  intensity  of  solar  proton  events  in  the 
atmosphere. On the other hand, it is obvious that the intensity of proton events in the atmosphere 
is  modulated  by  an  eccentricity  e(t).  Thus,  it  is  possible  to  suppose  that  the  generation  rate  of 
additional  insolation  transported  to  the  upper  atmosphere  by  the  turbulent  mechanism  of  heat 
transfer  in  linear  approximation  is  proportional  to  the  intensity  of  solar  proton  events  in  the 
atmosphere or, in other words, to the value of an eccentricity e(t):

energy-balance expression (1), we obtain

It is obvious that the expression (13) describes the collection of energy-balance functions 
∆U(T,a,b), which depend on two control parameters a(t) and b(t). There is no difficulty to note, 
that this collection represents so-called “potential” of fold catastrophe [31,32] (Fig. 2). In future 
we will be interested by an equation of fold catastrophe (13) relative to increment ∆Т=Т−Т0 of 
the following type:

Omitting the nicety of the computational methods of catastrophe theory [31,32] we show

(smooth local replacement of coordinates) it is possible to obtain the increment for the first term

The  physical  sense  of  the  inequality  ξG  ≥  0  consists  in  the  fact,  that  its  unsatisfaction 
results in the absurd result: the growth of the average temperature T0 results in a cool-down (as it 
follows from Eq. (20)).  

Sufficiently nonsimple behavior of the "potential" function V(∆T, t) can be to represented 
by the united geometrical picture (Fig. 2), which permits to show the variety of catastrophe or, in 
other words, the surface of equilibrium in three-dimensional space with coordinate axes ∆T-a-b 
[31]. The canonical form of the variety of the fold catastrophe, which represents point set ∆T-a-
b, satisfies the equation:

The Eq. (22) looks like a surface with fold (Fig. 2a). The projected fold as the line of a 
tuck (the set of critical points) is shown in Fig. 2b. Note that to the neighborhood of each point of 
the  surface  there  locally  corresponds  its  curve  of  "potential"  (18)  on  (a,b).  Some  of  such 
dependences are shown in the mapping of the catastrophe (Fig. 2c). 

The bifurcation set of fold catastrophe (or the set of critical points ac(t) and bc(t) depends 
on  the  nature  of  the  roots  of  Eq.  (22),  i.e.,  on  discriminant  D=4a3+27b2,  and  therefore  it  is 
described by the equation of semicubical parabola 

 

                                                                [

Thus the general bifurcation problem of the solution ∆Т(t) determination is reduced to the 
determination of the solution set of Eq. (22) for the appropriate joint trajectory a(t), b(t) in the 
space of control parameters. 

Now  we  are  ready    for  the  determination  of  the  solution  ∆Т(t)  of  bifurcation  problem 
(22),  for  example,  for  latitude  65o  N.  It  is  obvious,  that  base  (18)  and  the  bifurcation  (22) 
equations within the framework of any zonal energy-balance climate model formally save their 
form, but only concerning the variations of control parameters a(t), b(t) at latitude 65o N. In its 
turn,  control  parameters  a(t),  b(t)  "are  control"  by  the  variations  of  the  main  and  additional 
insolation. The nicety of zonal climatic model are exhibited with the advent of an advection term 
in Eqs. (1) and (18), which characterizes the flows of explicit and latent heat through the lateral 
faces of the element (zone) of ECS in the form of complementary constant A in expression ξG  
for control parameter b(t)

For  the  solution  of  bifurcation  Eq.  (22),  which  describes  the  extreme  values  of  the 
increment of temperature ∆T for the element (zone) оf ECS in latitude 65o N, it is necessary to 
determine the values of two climatic constants k and  ξG(A65°N) in Eqs. (19)-(21) and (24). The 
values of remaining parameters (except for average temperature T0) are known. For example, the 

values of an eccentricity e(t) (Fig. 3a) and normalized insolation 
(t) (Fig. 3b) are calculated 
by  Berger  [4-5].  The  value  of  mean-root-square  error  of  the  variation  of  insolation  is  equal  to 
σ

∆S=18.26 for the selected time period including 730 kyr in past and 100 kyr in future. 

Sˆ∆

The  selection  of  value  of  the  average  temperature  T0  was  made  from  following 
considerations.  The  value  of  modern  climatic  representative  temperature  under  the  data  Ghil 
[17,11]  and  Fraerdrich  [11]  is  about  T=288.6  K.  On  the  other  hand,  according  to  the  data  of 
Russian-French-Italian  researches  of  an  ice  core  from  a  hole  at  Russian  Antarctic  station 
"Vostoc" [33] the average value of the range of increment ∆T = [2, -6] is less approximately on 2 
K than the modern temperature. Therefore the value of average temperature equal to T0=286.6K 
was used for the further calculations. 

The  traditional  method  of  calibration  relative  to  experimental  data  was  applied  to  the 
determination of climatic constants k and ξG(A65°N). The essence of this method lies as follows. 
According to the experiments, which were made at Antarctic station "Vostoc" [33], it is possible 
to conclude that the jump of the temperature ∆T relative to average temperature T0=286.6 K was 
approximately ∆T≅4K at t=120 kyr ago. Such a supposition with regard for Eq. (23) reduces to 
the following single-valued form of bifurcation equation (22):

Hence the fixed values of control parameters a120=12K2 and b120=16K3 at t=120 kyr in the 
past  in  latitude  65o  N  make  it  possible  to  determine  the  values  of  climatic  constants  k  and 
ξG(A65°N) from Eqs. (19)-(21) and (24). Taking into account that at t=120 kyr in the past to the 
value  of  eccentricity  e120=0.038  there  corresponds  the  value  of  the  normalized  variation  of 
Sˆ∆ 120=2.3,  and  also  using  the  values  of  the  standard  error  of  the  variations  of 
insolation 
insolation  σ∆S=18.26,  Faegre  parameter  (3)  ηα=0.0092  K-1  and  Stefan-Boltzmann  constant

for the average temperature T0=286.6 K:

The time-dependent solution of bifurcation equation (22), which for the given method of 
the calibration of the value of climatic constants k and ξG(A65°N) describes the temporal changes 
of the increment of temperature ∆T relative to the average temperature T0=286.6 K for 730 kyr in 
the past and 100 kyr in future, is shown in Fig. 3d. In Fig. 3c oxygen isotope curve for deep-sea 
core V28-238 from Pacific Ocean over the past 730 kyr is presented. Data from Shackleton and 
Opdyke [34] are plotted against the PDB standard on the time scale of Kominz et al. [35]. The 
high goodness of fit between experimental (Fig. 3c) and theoretical (Fig. 3d) data is the peculiar 
indicator  of  the  high  quality  of  the  prognosis  of  the  temporal  changes  of  global  temperature 
T0+∆T in latitude 65oN over the next 100 kyr (Fig. 3d). 

It  is  known,  that  the  less  number  of  parameters  the  better  the  quality  of  model  other 
things  being  equal.  Therefore  it  is  necessary  now  to  tell  about  the  number  of  the  model 
parameters. It is obvious, that the number of parameters in multizonal model is equal to the order 
of  the  set  of  equations  (18),  determined  by  the  number  of  latitude  zones,  into  which  the 
hemisphere of the Earth is divided. On the other hand it is important to note that one-zone or, in 
other  words,  global  climate  model  is  practically  parameterless,  since  the  climatic  constant  k, 
ξG(A=0) and the average temperature T0 are completely determined by expressions (21) (taking 
into  account  the  indicated  above  calibration  relative  to  experimental  data).  In  this  sense,  the 
expression  “practically  parameterless  model  ”  means  only  that  in  the  global  climate  model  the 
values of control parameters a(t) and b(t) are set not by “hands”, but are obtained as a result of 
independent calculations. 

At this point it is appropriate to put the equation if the cosmic rays and, first of all, solar 
protons,  which  play  the  part  of  the  peculiar  catalyst  of  the  turbulent  mechanism  of  additional 
solar  heat  transport  to  the  upper  atmosphere,  can  be  the  reason  of  essential  variations  of  the 
paleointensity of geomagnetic field. The answer is affirmative and that is why.  

The  physical  mechanism  of  change  of  the  atmosphere  optical  transparency  under  the 
influence of cosmic rays predetermines a strong correlation between the maxima of solar proton 
intensities (predetermined by the maxima of eccentricity) and the largest changes of atmosphere 
albedo. Due to this strong correlation the solar and space protons should be not only the reason 
of perceptible variations of the paleointensity of geomagnetic field (Fig. 3e), but the periods of 

these variations should be close to the typical periods of the eccentricity amplitude. Strikingly, 
but  it  turned  out,  that  this  phenomenon  really  takes  place  and  is  steadily  observed  as  equally 
assigned  frequencies,  corresponding  to  the  typical  periods  (~100  and  ~410  kyr)  of  the 
modulations  of  eccentricity  amplitude,  both  in  the  spectrum  of  variations  of  the  increment  of 
temperature  (Fig.  4b)  and  in  the  spectrum  of  variations  of  virtual  axial  dipole  moment  of  the 
Earth (VADM) for time periods 0-800 kyr in the past [36] (Fig. 4a). Thus, it is possible to assert 
that the variations of the eccentricity influence independently both on magnetic field and climate 
of  the  Earth.  However,  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  that  the  relative  changes  of  true 
paleointensity will be different not only due to the different intensity of solar protons, but also 
due to the  influence of varied conditions of sludging on a paleomagnetic record. It is obvious, 
that basing on the time-dependent change of the variations of global or zone temperature, a real 
opportunity to estimate quantitative influence of the climate changes determining the conditions 
of sedimentation on the record of paleointensity variations of terrestrial magnetic field appears. 

Note  that  there  are  grounded  notions  about  possible  periodic  variability  of  the  Sun 
activity  under  the  influence  of  convection  caused  by  the  variable  gravitational  field  of  the 
planetary  system  [37],  and  it  should  be  reflected in the dynamics of paleoinsolation. The most 
interesting period in this model is the timing loop ~26 mill. years. For the first time cycle of such 
duration in geologic data was found out by Newall [38], who analyzed the data about the first 
and  the  last  occurrence  of  2250  families  of  animals  of  large  groups  in  the  paleontologic 
chronicle.  Recently  Raupe  and  Sepkoski  (1988)  carried  out  the  similar  research  at  more 
extensive sample of 9773 genera of zoolites for the period from Permian formation up to the end 
of  the  Pliocene  and  confirmed  the  presence  of  the  strongly  pronounced  interval  of  the  kind 
extinction, which was approximately 26 mill. years [38]. Such a regular periodicity is evidence 
of  the  fact  that  the  extinction  was  caused  by  any  astronomical  factor,  which  is  connected,  for 
example,  with  the  Sun,  the  Solar  system  and/or  the  Galaxy  [38].  In  addition,  during  these 
researches  close  correlation  between  the  paleoclimatic  characteristics  and  the  geologic  data 
relating to  the biological evolution of  the  Earth was found [39,37]. This fact has increased the 
interest to this problem. For example, it was shown that the climate cooling and it humidisation 
lead  to  increase  of  the  number  of  the  organism  families,  whereas  the  warming  and  aridisation 
cause their decreasing [37]. 

There  is  no  wonder  that  our  mechanism  of  cosmic  rays  action  on  the  variation  of 
geomagnetic  field  and  climate  and  the  connection  of  these  variations  with  the  value  of  solar 
proton intensity and eccentricity causes the natural question: "Do some singularities of galactic 
protons manifest or their role is limited only by the role of active "witness?" The essence of the 
question becomes clear, if we will remind that the main source of space protons are supernova 
outbursts  near  to  Galaxy  center  and  therefore  the  intensity  of  galactic  protons  is  directly 
determined by the corresponding elements of galactic orbit of the Solar system. It is interesting 
that in the resonance model of the galactic orbit of the Sun and its system [37] the following time 
intervals  of  orbital  elements  are  noticeable:  the interval of 50 million  years corresponds to the 
period of the orbit variations relative to the plane of the Galaxy; the interval of 75 million years 
corresponds  to  the  cycle  of  motions  of  the  Sun  between  two  points  -  apogalaxion  and 
perigalaxion;  the  interval  of  150  million  years  corresponds  to  the  cycle  of  motion  between 
apogalaxions (or perigalaxions) and interval of 225 million. years, i.e., the sidereal period of the 
Sun around of the Galaxy. It is obvious, that our model (18) through control parameter a(t), such 

as  Eq.  (19)  will  feel  changes  of  the  galactic  proton  intensity  caused,  for  example,  by  the 
variations of the orbit of Solar system with the period of ~50 million years relative to the plane 
of the Galaxy. These variations of the intensity of galactic protons cause the changes of magnetic 
field and climate of the Earth with the period equal approximately 25 million. years, which, in its 
turn,  is  explained  by  the  cyclic  passing  of  the  orbit  of  Solar  system  through  the  plane  of  the 
Galaxy. Taking into account that the interval between the maxima on extinction curve of Raupe 
and  Sepkoski  [38]  besides  the  period  of  25  million  years  contains  periods  between  the  higher 
maxima,  which  are  equal  to  75  and  150  million.  years,  it  is  possible  to  suppose  that  such  a 
coincidence  between  the  periods  of  the  variation  of  the  orbital  elements  of  Solar  system  (and, 
hence, of global climate of the Earth (18)) and the periods of change in the number of kinds of 
organisms on the Earth is hardly random. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  lifting  of  continents  dated  for  these  moments  can  be  connected 
with the nature of galactic gravitational field action on the rotating Earth [37]. And the motion of 
continents (as Monin correctly notes [9]) causes, respectively, the change of the part of their area 
in  an  equatorial  zone  and  polar  regions.  This,  apparently,  became  the  main  reason  of  gradual 
decrease of the level of temperature background reliably established by the facts [9] or, in other 
words,  of  gradual  decrease  of  the  average  temperature  T0  during  the  Cainozoe,  i.e.,  at  last  67 
million years.  

Such  decrease  of  temperature  and  simultaneous  appearance  of  glacial  epochs  in  the 
Cenozoic  many  researchers  connect  with  certain  resonance  properties  of  ECS,  which,  for 
example,  is  unresonance  at  the  averaged  temperature  13o  C  dominating  up  to  a  Cenozoic,  and 
responds  by  resonance  oscillations  generating  interglacial  and  glacial  epochs  at  the  averaged 
temperature below 10o C [9]. Such a hypothesis for the first time was advanced by P.Woldstedt 
[40] in 1954.  

In  this  connection,  let  us  consider  the  similar  role  of  the  absolute  value  of  the  average 
temperature T0 within the framework of our model. With that end in view we shall launch into 
digression? which is necessary for the explanation of a special role of temperature background 
level in dynamics of ECS. It is obvious, that time-independent (t=t0) probability density function 
p of random increment ∆T for the potential of fold catastrophe (18) looks like

∆t is the interval of averaging of temperature in Eq. (1).   

It is easy to see that Eq. (27) represents the stationary solution of Focker-Plank equation:

which describes the changes of the ensemble of climate states with initial distribution such as Eq. 
(27). This distribution arises, unlike the similar equation in Ref. [41], under the influence of not 
internal, but external random factors, i.e., control parameters a(t) and a(t).  

In  this  connection  let  us  note  three  moments,  which  are  very  important  for  the 
understanding of model possibilities. At first, the presence in Focker-Plank equation (28) right 
member of two terms, which are in charge of drift and diffusion, is evidence of the fact that it is 
an  equation  with  two  temporal  scales.  The  rapid  time  scale  τ1connected  with  an  inverse 
relaxation to local minimum after perturbation is predetermined by "drift" term, and the diffusion 
predetermines  slow  time  scale  τ2,  connected  with  transition  from  the  metastable  minimum  to 
global one.  

Secondly, Gilmore [31] (and Kramers even earlier [42]) obtained the estimation of these 
temporal  scales  of  Focker-Plank  equation  such  as  Eq.  (28).  For  comparison  let  us  show  the 
formulas for time scale τ1 (relaxation to the local minimum) and τ2 (diffusion from a metastable 
minimum in global one):

  is  the  curvature  (d2V/dx2)  of  function  in  the  local  minimum  and  local  maximum, 
where 
respectively,  ∆V  =  V(∆TM)  −  V(0),  ∆TM  and  ∆Tm=0  are  the  coordinates  of  the  metastable 
minimum and maximum of the potential of fold catastrophe.  

In  third,  Gilmore  has  shown  that  the  velocity  of  motion  of  critical  points  ∆Tc(t)  of  the 
potential function V(∆T,c(t)) is comparable to derivative dc/dt, and it made possible to formulate 
the  applicability  requirements  of  the  known  agreements  of  Thom  and  Maxwell  [31,32]  (which 
was intuitive up to that moment) using the time derivative of control parameters c∈{a(t),b(t)}:

In  order  to  obtain  the  periodic  temperature  variations  in  our  model  (18),  the  use  of 
Thom's principle of maximum delay (31) is necessary as, unlike Maxwell's principle, it ensures 
the presence of hysteresis loop on bifurcation set in the plane of control parameters (Fig. 2). In 
Fig. 5 the pictorial representations of the local dependence of function p(∆T) (which is generally 
bimodal)  on  control  parameters  (a, b)  at the neighborhood of some characteristic points of the 
surface of variety of catastrophe (22) (see Fig. 2). It is obvious, that the increase of the average 
temperature  T0  automatically  reduces  to  the  increase  of  generalized  parameter  ξG    in  Eq.  (21). 
This,  in  its  turn,  meets  following  geometrical  illustration:  path  of  с∈  {a(t)<0,  b(t)<0}  in  the 
space of control parameters mostly is in the second quadrant (Fig. 5), i.e., high temperature T0 
retains  ECS  in  "hot  climate"  state  (a(t)<0,  b(t)<0)  and  ECS  states  corresponding  to  glacial 
periods  ("cold  climate",  i.e.,  a(t)<0,  b(t)>0).  are  completely  excluded.  This  fact  in  natural  way 
explains the occurrence of glacial periods in the Pleistocene and their absence in the majority of 
other geologic epochs, although the insolation variations similar to the Quaternary, apparently, 
took place always.  

The analysis of bifurcation equation (22) shows that the modern thermic mode (which, in 
essence,  is  the  modern  version  of  so-called  11  stage  of  paleoclimate  [7])  is  very  sensitive  to 

hypothetical  changes  of  solar  constant.  According  to  our  calculations,  decreasing  of  solar 
constant  on  1.5  %  may  convert  the  existing  thermic  mode  to  "white  Earth"  condition.  Such  a 
conclusion at the qualitative level is confirmed by decreasing of generalized parameter ξG in Eq. 
(21), whose value is modulated by the value of the average solar insolation <S>.  

At last, it is necessary to say that the Earth climate system within the framework of given 
model  (18)  practically  is  not  sensitive  to  the  initial  data.  It  means  that  the  system  has  no 
restrictions on the global time horizon, i.e., its global behavior is predictable, and it contrary to 
the known hypothesis that climate should exhibit the properties of deterministic dynamics, which 
haves  a  chaotic  attractor  of  small  dimension  [43].  As  to  the  local  weather  forecasts,  as  it  is 
known,  the  best  of  used  now  models  have  about  6⋅106  variables,  and  therefore  the  error  of 
prediction doubles each three days. Nevertheless, the casual possibility of "peaceful" coexistence 
of  the  practically  infinite  global  time  horizon  (climate)  and  the  finite  local  time  horizon 
(weather)  can  be  illustrated  by  the  example  of  the  fractal  portrait  of  the  potential  of  fold 
catastrophe  (Fig.  6),  whose  hierarchical  structure  includes  the  determined  bistable  behavior  of 
climate  at  the  global  level  and  the  possibility  of  the  manifestation  of  the  determined  chaos  of 
"weathers" at the local level. Note, the fractal nature of the phenomenon can be exhibited in the 
multizone  version  of  the  energy-balance  model  (18)  of  Langevin  type,  in  which  the  local 
fluctuations (on short time intervals) play the prime role. In other words, the Langevin type of 
multizone  energy-balance  model  (18)  (in  the  form  of  the  system  of  stochastic  differential 
equations)  under  certain  conditions  can  ensure  such  a  type  of  non-linear  dynamics  of  ECS,  in 
which,  according  to  figurative  expression  of  M.Berry,  "determinism,  similarly  to  the  English 
queen, reigns, but does not rule" [44]. 

In  summary,  it  is  possible  to  say,  that  the  proposed  energy-balance  model  of  global 
climate,  which  takes  into  account  the  nontrivial  role  of  solar  and  galactic  protons,  not  only 
successfully  explains  many  nicety  of  the  paleoclimatic  records,  but  also  in  a  natural  way 
overcomes  all  known  difficulties  of  the  Milankovich  theory  arising  during  the  analysis  and 
interpretation of physical mechanism, by which the climate system responds to orbital forcing. 
However, in our opinion, the most important result of the offered model is the statement that the 
global climate of the Earth, on the one hand, is completely determined by two control parameters 
-  cosmic  rays  and  solar  insolation,  and,  on  the  other  hand,  it  has  practically  no  restrictions  on 
global time horizon, i.e., it is quite predictable. On the grounds of this statement the possibility 
for the exact formulation of the nontrivial problem of creation of the theory and methods of the 
global climate management opens for the first time, at least on the level of fixation of the modern 
state of climate [31].

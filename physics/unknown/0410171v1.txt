Abstract 
 
The penetration of plasma clouds, or plasmoids, across abrupt magnetic barriers (of the scale 
less than a few ion gyro radii, using the plasmoid directed velocity) is studied. The insight 
gained earlier, from experimental and computer simulation investigations of a case study, is 
generalised into other parameter regimes. It is concluded for what parameters a plasmoid 
should be expected to penetrate the magnetic barrier through self-polarization, penetrate 
through magnetic expulsion, or be rejected from the barrier. The scaling parameters are ne, v0, 
Bperp, mi, Ti, and the width w of the plasmoid. The scaling is based on a model for strongly 
driven, nonlinear magnetic field diffusion into a plasma, which is a generalization of the 
laboratory findings. The results are applied to experiments earlier reported in the literature, 
and also to the proposed application of impulsive penetration of plasmoids from the solar 
wind into the Earth’s magnetosphere. 
 
1. Introduction. 
 
6The subject investigated here is under what conditions fast plasma clouds (or plasmoids) 
can penetrate across abrupt magnetic barriers, which we here define as a situation where a 
transverse magnetic field components grows in space over less than a few ion gyro radii rgi 
(calculated using the transverse magnetic field component Bperp, and the plasma drift velocity 
v0). We propose a model which can be used to determine, based on the parameters ne, v0, Bperp, 
mi, Ti, and plasmoid width w, whether a given plasmoid will cross a magnetic barrier through 
self polarization (∆B/B ≈ 0, and EP ≈ -vxB), cross through magnetic field expulsion (∆B/B ≈ 
100%, and EP ≈ 0), by a mixture of these processes, or become rejected from the barrier. The 
study is limited to the transition across the barrier, and does not include the further 
propagation in the region with the transverse magnetic field. There is a companion paper in 
the present issue [1], and a recent series of four papers from our group in Physics of Plasmas 
[2-5]. The present paper is mainly based on, and extends the work in [5]. 
 
In the companion paper [1] results were reported from a laboratory experiment. High 
frequency oscillations in the lower hybrid range were found to play a key role in the 
penetration process, allowing anomalous fast diffusion of the magnetic field into the plasma. 
Such fast magnetic diffusion is a key process in the penetration of the plasma across the 
magnetic barrier. In the present paper we will describe a generalization of the results from [1] 
into a model that can be applied in other parameter regimes. The paper is organized as 
follows. In section 2 we will give a brief review of four selected experiments with plasma 
penetration into transverse magnetic fields, which together cover a wide range of parameters. 
We will use data from these experiments to demonstrate four key experimental facts, in the 
form of open questions, which will subsequently be used to benchmark our model. In section 
3 we will report further experiments in our plasma device and, based on them, make a 
generalization of the results in [1] to a model for strongly driven magnetic diffusion. We call 
it the nonlinear magnetic diffusion (NL-MD) model.  The NL-MD model is then

demonstrated to be consistent with the four observational facts described in Section 2. Section 
4 finally contains a discussion. 
 
For clarity, we want to note here that this study is limited to investigate diffusive penetration in 
which waves, or turbulence, give anomalous fast magnetic diffusion. Alternative mechanisms, 
for example decoupling through parallel electric fields, have also been proposed, see [1]. A 
united investigation remains to be made of when one or the other (or none) is operating. 
  
2. Background 
 
Experiments have been made for several decades on plasma streams entering transverse 
magnetic fields, se references in [2-5]. We will here present data from four of these, chosen to 
cover the range of parameters of interest. We begin by describing these four experiments, and 
then give a brief overview of the main results and point at some open questions. 
 
The experiments of Song et al [6] were made using a plasma source with high kinetic energy 
in the sense that b k > 1 at the entry of the plasma into the transverse magnetic field, close to 
the source. Here b k = WK/WB is the ratio between the plasma’s kinetic energy density and the 
transverse magnetic field energy density. All measurements were made at distances more than 
2m from the plasma source. They are therefore made long after the magnetic transition that is 
our prime object of study, and after a phase of more than 2 m translation of the plasma across 
a transverse magnetic field. Considerable plasma expansion and sometimes ‘post-transition’ 
magnetic diffusion need to be kept in mind. We will here use data from two experiments, 
made at 50 Gauss (0,005T) and 300 Gauss (0,03T), for different purposes. In the 50 Gauss 
experiment there was almost complete magnetic expulsion maintained all the way the most 
distant measurement at 3,57m. This experiment here represents high normalized kinetic beam 
energy, b k > 1, and penetration through magnetic expulsion. In the 300 Gauss experiment, the 
final stages of magnetic penetration were measured, from ∆B/B = 15% at 2,05 m to ∆B/B = 
2% at 3,75m. At a distance of 2,69m from the source, the beam width was reported to be 18 
times the ion gyro radius. The 300 Gauss experiment is here used to represent (using only the 
measurements at 2,69m) a plasmoid which propagates by self-polarization to E = - vxB, and 
with a large normalized width w >> rgi.   
 
The experiments of Izishuka and Robertson [7] were made to investigate a proposed low 
energy density, ‘electrostatic’ limit for plasma stream penetration through self-polarization. 
The experiments were made using a charge-neutralized proton beam (140kV, 6-15A/cm2, 
800ns, from an ion diode), which was shot into a region with a transverse magnetic field of 
variable strength up to 0,3T. The normalized beam width was about unity, w/rgi ≈ 1. With an 
ion current of 12A/cm2, corresponding to a plasma density of 1,4x1017m-3, they found a 
critical limit at a magnetic field strength of B = 0,25T. For lower magnetic field strengths, the 
plasma beam penetrated the magnetic barrier through self-polarization. For 0,25T and higher 
magnetic field strengths, the plasma beam failed to penetrate. This experiment here represents 
two phenomena, (1) the rapid magnetization and self-polarization of a low energy density 
beam, and (2) the ‘electrostatic’ lower limit to kinetic beam energy below which plasmoids 
can not penetrate a magnetic barrier.  
 
The third experiment is made by our own group and is described in the companion paper [1] 
and in [3-5]. It represents a middle ground regarding most experimental parameters. Plasma 
streams had intermediate width, w/rgi ≈ 0,3 to 1, and normalized kinetic energy densities b k in 
the range 0,5 to 10. The plasma was, immediately after the transition, in a mixed state of

questions listed in section 2. 

 
magnetic field expulsion and self-polarization. The values of ∆B/B in the centre were 
(depending on the b k value) in the range 13% to 74%. 
 
The fourth experiment we will use is the Porcupine ionospheric injection experiment, as 
reported by Mishin et al [8]. The Porcupine experiment was made with a dense (nb >> namb) 
heavy ion (xenon, mi = 131) beam, which was shot into the ambient ionosphere from a 
spinning rocket sub payload. Measurements were made on the main payload, at distances 
from 3 m when the beam was switched on, and out to distances of the gyro radius, 475 m. For 
a distance out to 4,5 m from the ion source there was a diamagnetic cavity (∆B/B ≈ 100%), in 
excellent agreement with theoretical expectations based on the source’s known ion 
temperature of 50 eV (this cavity was maintained by transverse ion thermal pressure, which is 
a fundamentally different mechanism from the magnetic expulsion in the experiment by Song 
et al [6], and in our own experiment). Outside the magnetic cavity, the ambient magnetic field 
penetrated quickly, and almost completely, into the beam. Already at distances r < 12-15 m, 
∆B/B ≈ 0,2% was measured. This experiment represents the self-polarization of a high-to-low 
energy density, narrow plasma beam (w/rgi << 1), with very fast diffusion of the magnetic 
field. 
 
These four experiments cover basic parameters from b k <<1 to b k >>1, from w/rgi <<1 to w/rgi 
>>1, and from magnetic expulsions ∆B/B from 0,2% to almost 100%. The experiment by 
Izhizuka and Robertson [7] pinpoints the low energy limit when the plasmoids cannot 
penetrate due to the electrostatic limit. Our own experiment covers a middle ground with 
respect to b k and w/rgi, and is at the transition between self-polarization and magnetic 
expulsion. It also includes the most detailed investigation of the magnetic diffusion 
mechanism. Several questions arise from a consideration of how the material in these diverse 
experiments can be put in a single frame. We here consider four of these questions. 
          
(1) Three important parameters are energy densities, as illustrated in Fig. 1: the directed 
kinetic energy density WK = minv2/2 in the plasmoid, the electric field energy density WE 
perp/2m 0 of 
=e 0E2/2 in a self-polarized plasmoid, and the magnetic field energy density WB = B2
the transverse magnetic field in the magnetic barrier. Consider the parameter regime marked 
‘1’ in Fig. 1. A high energy (b k >1) plasmoid can always penetrate a magnetic barrier, either 
through magnetic field expulsion (∆B/B ≈ 100%, and EP ≈ 0), through self-polarization (∆B/B 
≈ 0, and EP ≈ -vxB), or through a combination of both. However, the b k value alone does not 
determine what happens. In the experiment by Song et al [6] at 50 Gauss, in the experiment 
by ourselves [5], and in Porcupine [8] at 9 m from the source, we can find data that in all three

cases correspond to values b k about unity. Yet the degree of magnetic expulsion ranges from 
less than 0,2% to almost 100%. Fig. 2 shows that the width of the plasmoid is an important 
parameter. A wide plasma stream tends to exclude the magnetic field, and a narrow plasma 
stream to become self-polarized. Question 1 (b k >1): What determines if there is magnetic 
expulsion or self-polarization, and where is the limit? 
 
(2) Consider the parameter regime marked ‘2’ in Fig. 1. A low energy (b k <1) plasmoid has 
only energy enough to expel a fraction of the magnetic field, ∆B/B <1. It can therefore only 
penetrate through magnetic diffusion combined with self-polarization. The energy budget 
however requires that ∆B/B <1 is maintained at all times, also during the transition. The 
magnetic field has to penetrate the plasma on the same time scale as the transition time. For 
an abrupt transition in the sense studied here, this requires very efficient magnetic penetration, 
on the ion gyro time scale. Such mechanisms have to exist: the laboratory experiments by 
Ishizuka and Robertson [7], and also the Porcupine experiment [8] (for distances larger than 
10 m from the source), show this for b k values far below unity. This requirement of fast 
magnetic diffusion becomes stricter for lower b k, where there is only enough energy for a 
small fraction ∆B/B to be expelled. Question 2 (b k < 1): What determines the residual value 
of ∆B/B, and how is it energetically possible to create it for low b k? 
 
(3) Consider the parameter regime marked ‘3’ in Fig. 1. In the lower end of this range there is 
a definite lower limit for penetration at energy density at WK = WE, when the kinetic energy is 
just sufficient to establish the self-polarization field. Theory [9] gives a higher limit, which 
has been called the electrostatic limit: WK >> (mi/me)1/2WE. The exact value is uncertain. The 
only experiment where it has been determined [7] gave WK = 10(mi/me)1/2WE. Question 3 (b k 
<< 1): What determines the low b k, or electrostatic, limit for penetration? 
 
(4) Lindberg [10] proposed an often quoted condition w/rgi < 0,5 to set an upper limit to the 
width of self-polarized plasmoids, using an energy argument that is schematically illustrated 
in the upper panel of Fig. 3. In a self-polarized beam, there is in the laboratory rest frame a 
potential difference across the beam of ∆U = wEP = v0wBperp. It is an experimental

fact, also reproduced in simulations [2], that the low potential side of the beam is closest to 
the upstream potential, giving equipotential surfaces as indicated in Fig. 3. An ion that shall 
reach position (b) from the upstream plasma will therefore, argued Lindberg, in the transition 
have to climb a potential hill ∆U. For this it needs to have a minimum energy Wi > e∆U, or 
2/2 > ev0wBperp. This is readily rewritten into Lindberg’s condition w/rgi < 0,5. On the 
miv0
other hand, in the experiment of Song et al [6] at 300 Gauss, there was a close to self-
polarized beam (∆B/B < 15% ) with a width of w/rgi = 18. This is illustrated in the lower panel 
of Fig. 3; the potential difference ∆U across the beam is here about 30 times the ion energy. 
Question 4: in what way is the penetration mechanism in the experiment by Song et al [6] 
different than envisaged by Lindberg [10]?   
 
3. The nonlinear magnetic diffusion (NL-MD) model 
 
The waves, which were demonstrated in the companion paper [1] to produce anomalous fast 
magnetic diffusion into the plasma stream, were investigated closely in [3,4]. It was 
concluded that all wave features correspond well to a highly nonlinear version of the modified 
two-stream instability (MTSI), driven to high amplitude by a strong diamagnetic current JD. 
The high amplitudes reached during 1 m s of passage through the magnetic transition was 
consistent with this interpretation: linear theory for the MTSI [3] gives 10 – 26 linear growth 
times during the penetration time 1 m s. The effect of the waves was found [1,3,4] to be 
equivalent to an anomalous transverse resistivity h EFF which gave a magnetic diffusion time 
t B = m 0L2/(4h EFF) = 0,5 m s) of the same order as required. The driving mechanism for the 
current JD was the (in the plasma’s rest frame) time-changing magnetic field in the transition 
region. The most important observation for our purpose here concerns the current density JD, 
which was measured to be in a range where the relative velocity between the ions and the 
electrons (U = vez – viz ) exceeds the ion thermal velocity by a factor U/vthi ≈ 1,7 – 3,6, where 
vthi = (3kTi/mi)1/2. In [5] the experimental parameter regime was extended from the single case 
studied in [3,4] to cover a factor 10 in density. Examples of the data are shown in Fig. 4. The 
diamagnetic cavity ∆B/B was in all cases maintained by about the same (normalized) 
diamagnetic current densities, with U = vez – viz varying by + 34% around a mean value of 
U/vthi ≈  2,3.

Fig. 4. Measurements with multi-probe arrays on the penetration of three 
plasmoids that vary a factor 10 in density, from [5]. The top plates show 
the plasma potential in the laboratory rest frame. The middle plates show 
the transverse magnetic field strength (notice that the diamagnetic cavities 
show up as peaks due to the negative sign of By). The bottom plates show 
the potential in the moving rest frame of the plasma. The plasma density 
and  b k  increases  from  left  to  right,  and  also  the  degree  of  magnetic 
expulsion in the centre (13%, 32%, and 74%). 

 
The explanation proposed in [5] for this preferred value of U/vthi is basically the following, 
and is illustrated in Fig. 5. The wave amplitude, and thus the effective anomalous resistivity, 
should increase with the strength of the current JD that drives the instability. Suppose that 
there is an increase of h EFF with JD such as in Fig 5. This would give a self-organizing 
feedback loop that determines the gradient in the magnetic field during the magnetic diffusion 
process. The diamagnetic current density (and thus, through curlB = m 0JD, the gradient in field 
strength) will adjust to a value that depends on how strongly the process is driven. One 
example is the marginal stability (MS) analysis for weakly driven systems (see e. g. [11]). 
Such systems will stay close to the marginally stable state (A in Fig. 5). It was proposed in [5] 
that for strongly driven systems the diamagnetic current sheath should preferentially be 
located at the steep part of the curve, B-C-D in Fig. 5. Assume, for example, (at point D in 
Fig. 5) that the diffusion process is faster than the external driving mechanism, in the sense 
that the magnetic field profile flattens as a function of time. A flattening of the magnetic 
profile is equivalent to decreasing JD, going from D towards C in Fig. 5. This will decrease

the value of h EFF, reduce the magnetic diffusion speed, and counteract the flattening of the 
profile. If, on the other hand, the diffusion process (at point B in Fig. 5) is slow in the sense 
that that the magnetic gradient increases when the external magnetic field grows, then the 
reverse process would happen. In both cases, the profile tends to approach point C in Fig. 5. 
In the steep part of the curve a narrow range ∆JD corresponds to a large range ∆h EFF.  Current 
densities lying rather close above some value B, where the curve begins to increase steeply, 
would be preferred in a large range in driving strengths of the diffusion. The steepness of the 
curve, as we have been able to estimate it from experimental data [5], is an order of 
magnitude larger than in Fig. 5: the increase of h EFF from the threshold (at A) to C is in the 
experiment a factor 200 – 300, while it in this figure is only a factor 25. A curve drawn to 
scale would in the range B-C-D be close to a vertical line.  
 
The nonlinear magnetic diffusion (NL-MD) proposal in [4] can be expressed in three steps, 
essentially as follows: (1) for a plasmoid entering an abrupt magnetic barrier, the magnetic 
diffusion is very strongly driven. Only the fastest driven instability has time to grow and 
contribute to the diffusion; there should for this instability exist a functional relationship 
h EFF(JD) of the type shown in Fig. 5, which however needs to be properly normalized with 
respect to experimental parameters. (2) From the experimental data it was concluded that the 
operating instability is the MTSI, which has a threshold at diamagnetic currents such that 
U/vthi ≈ 1. In experiments over a range of 10 in plasma density, the diamagnetic current 
density was found to scale with density as ne
a variation of + 34%. The quantity U/vthi is therefore proposed to give the proper  
 

-1, and was of such strength that U/vthi ≈  2,3  with

expulsion depends on which is larger of w/rgi and [2,3(b kb ith)1/2]-1. Eq. 3 gives 
an estimate of the expulsion ∆B/B for cases when ∆B/B <<1.

normalization. (3) The diffusion rate (proportional to h EFF in Fig. 5) is proposed to vary so 
steeply with JD at U/vthi ≈ 2,3  that this is a good approximation in a wide range of strongly 
driven magnetic diffusion. The assumption of nonlinear magnetic diffusion (NL-MD) is thus 
equivalent to assuming that the diamagnetic current density is given by 
 
 
 
where vthi = (3kTi/mi)1/2. Let us now test this against the four questions from Section 2 above. 
 
3.1. High bbb b k plasmoids : magnetic expulsion or self-polarization? 
 
We first use Eq. (1) to determine when a plasmoid is in a state of marginal magnetic 
expulsion where B = B0 outside, and  B = 0 just in the middle of the plasmoid. If the plasma is 
elongated and has a width w, then Eq. (1) and Maxwell’s Equation curlB = m 0JD gives [5] the 
relation B0 = m  wJD/2 = 2,3enevithm 0w/2. This can be rewritten using the dimensionless 
variables w/rgi, b k, and b ith, where the first two have already been defined, b ith = With/WB, and 
where With is the thermal ion energy density nimiv2
ith/2.  Using these dimensionless variables, 
[5] found that the normalized beam width w/rgi determines if the magnetic field will be 
exposed from a plasmoid or not. The limit, marginal magnetic expulsion, is at  
 
 
 
Wider beams should penetrate through magnetic expulsion, and much narrower beams by 
self-polarisation (and ∆B/B <<1). Table I gives the parameters for the experiments shown in 
Fig. 2, leading to question 1 of section 2. These experiments were made at about the same b k 
value, but with different widths: Song et al [6] at 50 Gauss had a wide beam according to Eq. 
2, and almost 100% magnetic expulsion from the whole plasma. Our own experiment [5] had 
a beam width about a factor 5 below the limit of Eq. 2, and was close to self polarization with 
∆B/B = 13%.  In the Porcupine experiment finally [8] the beam width was a factor 100 below 
the limit, and there was only 0,02 % magnetic expulsion. There is clearly good agreement 
between the data in Fig. 2 and Eq. 2. 
 

w/rgi = [2,3(b kb ith)1/2]-1.

∆B/B0 = 2,3(w/rgi) (b kb ith)1/2  .  

3.2. Low bbb b k plasmoids: how can the fast magnetic diffusion be energetically possible?   
 
For low b k plasmoids, self-polarization is the only possibility to penetrate. However, there is 
always  a residual degree of magnetic expulsion given by the diamagnetic current density of 
Eq. 1. Defining ∆B as the difference (B0 – Bc) between the centre and the surrounding, the 
NL-MD assumption of Eq. (1) corresponds [5] to a degree of expulsion 
 
 
 
A linear decrease from the edge to the centre corresponds to an average decrease of ∆B/2 in 
magnetic field strength, and a change in magnetic energy which for small ∆B/B0  can be 
2/2m 0  – (B0 - ∆B/2)2/2m 0  ≈ ∆B B0/2m 0. This degree of magnetic 
approximated as ∆WB ≈ B0
expulsion can only be achieved if the directed kinetic energy is high enough, WK > ∆WB. A 
little algebra gives the condition for low b k plasmoids to penetrate through self-polarization:  
 
 
 
The physics can be understood as follows. When Eq. (4) is fulfilled, the beam energy is 
sufficient to create a magnetic cavity of the depth given by Eq. (3), with h EFF in the steep 
range B-C-D in Fig. 5. This sets the stage for further rapid magnetic diffusion into the 
plasmoid. The magnetic change ∆B does not grow any larger, and the kinetic energy in the 
plasma is sufficient to maintain it throughout the diffusion process. Notice that the plasma 
density does not enter into the energy condition of Eq. (4): there is, counter-intuitively, no 
lower limit to the plasma density motivated by the energy budget. Instead, the ion temperature 
(through b ith) turns our to be important. The reason for this is straightforward. If the ion 
thermal speed is high, this will increase the threshold current density for the instability. In 
order to reach the NL-MD state of Eq. (1), a penetrating plasmoid will then need to push out a 
larger fraction of the magnetic field, which requires more energy. 
 
3.3. What  determines the low bbb b k, or electrostatic, limit for penetration? 

w/rgi < (1/2,3)((b k /b ith) = (1/2,3)(v0/vith).

In the experiment by Ishizuka et al [7], the electrostatic limit to penetration was found to be a 
factor of 10 above the theoretical limit which was WK = (mi/me)1/2WE.  We propose that the 
limiting factor is the energy condition of Eq. (4). The limit found in their experiment [7] 
coincides excellently with Eq. (4), as shown in [5], figure 8. The description by Ishizuka et al 
[7] of the rejection mechanism is also consistent with this conclusion: as discussed in the 
companion paper [1, Fig. 8], there is an intimate connection between anomalous magnetic 
diffusion and anomalous electron transport across the magnetic field. Ishizuka et al [7] state 
that ‘the electrons were stopped at the field boundary. The ions entered the field and created 
a positive sheath which caused the beam to be reflected rather than transmitted’. This is 
precisely what should be expected if the plasma stream did not have enough energy to drive a 
diamagnetic current of sufficient strength to (by means of the instability) allow the electrons 
to follow the ions into the transverse field region. 
  
3.4. How can Lindberg’s condition be reconciled with the experiment of Song et al [6]? 

The question which is illustrated in Fig. 3 is how a plasmoid can be observed to have a width 
of 18 rgi (bottom panel) in view of Lindberg’s condition that it shall be limited below 0,5 rgi 
(upper panel). The answer is that the plasmoid of Song et al [6] did not enter the transverse 
field in the manner envisaged by Lindberg, where individual ions have to climb a

electrostatic and stationary potential hill ∆U = wEP in the transition region (upper panel). 
Instead, we propose the following: our Eq. (2) indicates that the plasma beam in the 
experiment by Song et al first entered the transverse field by almost complete expulsion of 
the magnetic field close to the plasma source. In the following propagation the plasma beam 
expanded, and the magnetic field began to diffuse into it. In the measurements by Song et al 
[6] only the last stages of this diffusion was reported, from ∆B/B = 15% at 2,05m to 2% at 
3.75m. The ions do not climb any potential ∆U = wEP in such a process. They nevertheless 
lose energy, both to create the initial magnetic cavity and to drive the instability that enables 
the magnetic diffusion. These processes probably are involved in the observed velocity 
reduction from 7x104 m/s at the source to 2,8x104 m/s at 2,69 m. (We note that the lower ion 
speed gives a smaller gyro radius. The larger gyro radius obtained with the source velocity 
7x104 m/s is not, however, enough to reconcile the experiment with Lindberg’s condition. It 
is still violated by a factor of 14). 
 
The relaxing of Lindberg’s condition seems quite natural in this case, when the magnetic 
diffusion proceeds on a time scale much slower than the transition time into the transverse 
magnetic field. There is no obvious part of the device where the ions have a potential hill to 
climb. However, a closely related effect comes into play also for fast magnetic diffusion, 
when the plasma becomes self-polarized immediately in the transition. In this case the quasi-
dc potential structures look just as in the upper panel of Fig. 3. The key quasi-dc electric field 
component is that along the plasma flow, in the z direction. The ions lose kinetic energy 
when they move against this field. However, when there is rapid magnetic diffusion in the 
transition region, there are also hf wave fluctuations there. A close look at how the wave Ez 
field direction is correlated with the ion density [4, section VI d] reveals that the wave field 
systematically counteracts the quasi-dc electric field structure, and ‘helps the ions to climb’ 
to the high potential side. This relaxes Lindberg’s condition, which is based on the ion 
energy budget. Wider beams than rgi/2 are thus possible. 
 
4. Discussion 
 
We have found that one single, very simple, assumption gives a consistent explanation to a 
broad spectrum of observations for plasmoids that enter magnetic barriers. The assumption is 
that a diamagnetic current which is strongly driven will self-organize to a critical value where 
it corresponds to an electron-ion drift a few times the ion thermal speed, Eq. (1).  
 
It should be noted that this model only applies to cases where the magnetic field changes so 
abruptly in the plasma’s rest frame (with the transition time of the order of the ion gyro time) 
that only the very fastest instability, which we propose to be the MTSI, has time to grow and 
contribute to the magnetic diffusion mechanism. Also, we do not follow the process 
downstream. In this further motion, there will be continued diffusion of the magnetic field 
into a propagating plasmoid, the magnetic field change ∆B will decrease below that of 
equations (2)  and (3), and the fast instability driven in the transition will eventually give 
place to slower instabilities, driven by lower diamagnetic current densities. This falls outside 
the scope of this work. 
 
Some further results along the lines of the present work were reported in [5]. A parameter 
diagram was given, in which it can from basic parameters conveniently be assessed whether 
a given plasmoid will be rejected from a magnetic barrier, cross it by self polarization, or 
cross it by magnetic expulsion. It was also considered in [5] within what parameter range 
dense clumps in the solar wind, plasmoids, could enter the Earth’s magnetosphere by the

diffusive mechanism treated in this paper. Briefly summarized, solar wind plasmoids with 
width below about 35 km might penetrate the magnetosphere through self-polarization, while 
those of width larger than 350 km will need to penetrate mainly through magnetic expulsion. 
In the intermediate parameter range, 35-350 km, one has to look at the parameters for each 
individual case. Finally, a first step was taken towards a generalization of the NL-MD model, 
which here (Eq. 1) is based on the approximation of a constant diamagnetic current density. A 
functional relationship h EFF(JD, ne, vith, Te) was proposed that can be applied to any case with 
strongly driven magnetic diffusion, including time-dependent problems, and with space 
resolution of variable current densities JD. This model was applied to the transition across the 
magnetic barrier in our experiment and reproduced the experimental data quite acceptably, as 
shown in Fig. 6.

The Causal Event Set 
 
Alasdair Macleod† 
 
ABSTRACT 
 

 
To clarify some aspects of the application of Special Relativity, spacetime is sliced into null geodesic hypersurfaces as an 
alternative to the hypersurfaces of simultaneity normally adopted. Events at particle locations on the hypersurface are 
identified as the causal event set. It is demonstrated that a Lorentz boost applied to the causal event set maintains the 
property of connectedness and with this formalism it is simple to derive the redshift equation. The twin paradox is naturally 
explained as an instantaneous reconfiguration of particle position 4-vectors in the frame of the accelerated object. The 
metaphysical implications are examined with the tentative conclusion that a relationist view of spacetime is more consistent 
with this treatment than the substantivalist viewpoint.

1. Introduction 
 

the

the  process  by  which 

The  Special  Theory  of  Relativity  unifies  space  and 
time  and  although  the  application  of  the  basic 
postulates  results  in  counter-intuitive  predictions, 
these  have  been  fully  verified  by  experiment  1. 
However,  in  spite  of  the  overwhelming  evidence, 
there are still some who do not accept the fundamental 
principles  of  relativity  (although  the  form  of  the 
criticism  is  often  manifest  through  a  disagreement 
with 
relativistic 
transformation  rules  are  derived).  It  is  interesting  to 
consider  why  this  is  the  case.  The  theory  is  clearly 
unpalatable to many because it goes against common 
sense  and  there  is  certainly  a  lack  of  an  ontological 
structure  from  which  the  principles  of  relativity 
naturally emerge. There is currently no answer to the 
question  ‘Why  is  the  speed  of  light  a  constant?’ 
though one would suspect that the question is key to a 
deep  understanding  of 
is  no 
exaggeration to state that Special Relativity exists in a 
metaphysical  vacuum.  Metaphysics      has  offered the 
physicist little assistance in developing a rationale for 
the frame independence of the speed of light, or even 
why  the  laws  of  physics  should  be  the  same  in  all 
inertial frames.  
 
In this paper some aspects of the criticism of Special 
Relativity will be reviewed and it will be shown that 
by  changing  the  way  spacetime  is  sliced,  from  the 
hypersurface  of  simultaneity  to  a  null  geodesic 
hypersurface, 
relativistic 
transformations  becomes  practically  easier  and  a 
metaphysical  basis  for  the  postulates  begins  to 
emerge. 
 
2. Paradoxes and Problems  
 
The two basic postulates of Special Relativity are that 
the laws of physics are the same in any inertial frame 
and that the speed of light is a constant independent of 
reference frame 2.  
 
Whilst  there is some debate as to whether space is a 
substantive medium in which particles are embedded 
or  an  artefact  arising  from  the  relationship  between 
particles¶, the prevalent viewpoint is that spacetime is 
substantial.  Support  for  this comes  from the  theories 
of  General  Relativity  (GR)  and  Quantum  Mechanics 
(QM), the two most successful theories devised. Both 
require  a  ‘real’  space-time.  In  GR,  space-time  is 
assigned  a  local  curvature,  which  elegantly  explains 
gravitational  effects.  QM  requires  that  empty  space 
have 
initiate 
zero-point 
‘spontaneous’ emission.  
 
In spite of the undoubted correctness of GR and QM, 
some situations are still analysed classically, using, for 
example,  Maxwell’s  field  equations.  Here  too  a 
substantial  space  is  required:  action-at-a-distance  is 
expressly forbidden; interaction is expected to satisfy  
‘spatiotemporal  locality’3  with  the  space  between

¶ In ontological terms, the substantivalist viewpoint states that 
space (time) is an entity whilst the relationist view is that space is 
an expression of the relationship between entities. The differing 
viewpoints can be illustrated by considering the series of integers 
1, 2, 3, .. and asking what lies between them. One substantivalist 
response (not the only one) might be to describe the fractional 
numbers in between that support the entire edifice. The relationist 
may say the question is irrelevant and arises from a 
misunderstanding – the series is simply a list of distinct entities as 
is demonstrated if the labelling is altered to a, b, c..  

distant  interacting  entities  occupied  by  fields  to 
maintain spatiotemporal continuity.  
 
The  Special  Theory  of  Relativity  has  revolutionised 
our understanding of space and time and shown that it 
is the  space-time continuum that must be considered 
real – not just space itself. Separating space from time 
and assigning it form simply reintroduces the æther, a  
fluid with mechanistic properties that was proven not 
to  exist  by 
the  Michelson-Morley  and  other 
experiments  §. This distinction is crucial if the speed 
of  light  is  to  be  independent  of  inertial  frame  and  a 
failure  to  appreciate  the  difference  is  the  source  of 
much erroneous criticism.   
 
Criticism of Special Relativity at a metaphysical level 
is actually rare. The critics instead tend to concentrate 
on  particular  problems  and  the  mechanics  of  how 
information  is  acquired  and  conveyed.  The  focus  is 
frequently on the so-called twin paradox (also known 
as  the  clock  paradox).  One  form  of  the  supposed 
paradox  concerns  two  hypothetical  twins  A  and  B. 
Twin B is accelerated and travels to a distant star then 
decelerates  and  returns  to  Earth.  Special  Relativity 
predicts that twin B will have aged less than the stay-
at-home  twin  A.  The  ‘paradox’  arises  because  from 
the  stationary  or  rest frame  of  twin B, it is the Earth 
that  appears  to  be  moving,  first  away  and  then 
towards,  with  the  result  that  twin  B  will predict  that 
the twin on Earth will have aged less using the same 
argument  as 
is  obviously 
contradictory: they cannot both have aged less. 
 
Clearly  the  situation  is  asymmetrical  because  of  the 
acceleration  of  twin  B,  but  the  persistence  of  the 
paradox is astonishing - as recent as 2001, Dolby and 
Gull felt the need to explain away the paradox 5.  One 
reason for its persistence is that, having accepted that 
the  acceleration  on  one  twin  is  the  cause  of  the 
asymmetry, it is not made clear by many authors how 
precisely it affects the calculations, particularly when 
it is well known that Special Relativity can be applied 
in  a  piecewise  manner 
involving 
acceleration  without  the  need  for  corrections  (even 
with accelerations as large as 1019 g, as demonstrated 
by  Bailey  et  al  6).  A  typical  example  of  the  lack  of 
detail  offered  by  some  sources  is  the  conclusion  to 
Sciama’s explanation of the paradox 7: 
 

sibling.  This

the 

“..  the  difference  ..  is  that  B  has  accelerated 
relative  to  distant  matter  while  our  stay-at-
home  A  has  not.  …These  considerations 
dispose of the clock 'paradox'. “ 

 
In 1971, Marder published a entertaining book 8 on the 
subject showing the resoluteness of some objectors of 
the  time,  particularly  Professor  Dingle.  In  the  book, 
the  resolution  of  the  paradox  is clear, but apparently 
not sufficiently to sway the critics. 
 
There is no doubting the correct application of Special 
Relativity is difficult; even experienced scientists err. 
For example, in 1977, Davies and Jennison 9 measured 
the  redshift  of  light  reflected  from  a  transversely 
moving  mirror.  A  null  result  was  obtained,  in 
contradiction with some of the theoretical predictions 
from earlier literature. The authors noted that several 
theorists had incorrectly applied Special Relativity to 
the situation.

(Lowe  10  examines  in  some  detail  the  link  between 
counterfactual conditionals and causality) 
 

For  this  reason  it  is  still  worthwhile  considering  if 
there  are  alternative  ways  of  presenting  Special 
Relativity,  both  to  make  it  easier  to  apply  and  to 
identify  faulty  reasoning  that  leads  to  the  apparent 
paradoxes.  
 
 
3. Reference Frame 
 
A reference frame is a standard against which motion 
is  measured.  A  coordinate  system  is  imposed  on the 
frame  to  enable  events  and particle  parameters  to  be 
quantified. The reference frame may adopt a variety of 
coordinate  systems,  but  it  is  usual  to  describe  space 
using  three  orthogonal  Cartesian  coordinates  and 
assign  a  single  coordinate  to  time.  Events  are  then 
represented  by 4-vectors.  The world is the collection 
of  all  such  events.  However,  it  is  not  convenient  for 
the human brain to manage the entirety of spacetime. 
Instead  spacetime  is  foliated  (or  sliced)  into  a 
collection  of  spacelike  hypersurfaces.    All  events  on 
this  hypersurface  are  described  as  simultaneous  (the 
surface  is  also  referred  to  as  the  hypersurface  of 
simultaneity).  This  is  most  easily  visualised  using  a 
space-time  diagram.  With  the  observer  located  at 
position x = 0 with proper time t = t, the hypersurface 
of  simultaneity  is  represented  by  the  horizontal  line 
(red)  in  Figure  1.  The  three  space  dimensions  are 
reduced to one for convenience. 
 

 

 
 

Figure 1   World map and world view 

 
 
The  set  of  events  on  the  surface  of  simultaneity  is 
known as the observer’s world map. The hypersurface 
of simultaneity is constructed by imposing the proper 
time of the observer on all of space even though local 
time may possibly advance at a different rate at other 
locations.  We  recognise  it  as  the  normal  surface  to 
which  the  equations  of  physics  are  applied.  For 
example,  the  definition  of  proper  velocity  as  the 
change in ‘proper’ distance with respect to proper time 
is illustrated in Figure 2. 
 
The  use  of  the  world  map  is  based  on  an  implicit 
assumption  that  the  observer  can  travel  freely  at 
infinite  speed.  The  frame  cannot  be  maintained  by 
measurement,  only  by  the  use  of  counterfactual 
statements  and  deduction.  For  example,  one  might 
say, ‘I see that galaxy as it was one million years ago. 
If light travelled at an infinite speed, I would see that 
the galaxy is now much further away’ and ‘To find the 
real  length  of  a  rapidly  moving  object,  I  have  to 
extrapolate the position of each end at the same time’.

The world map has a unique and interesting property – 
it  is  the  only  way  to  slice  spacetime  such  that every 
event on the surface is causally disconnected from all 
other  events  on  the  surface.  It  cannot  be  considered 
surprising therefore that the issue of the ‘relativity of 
simultaneity’ 
are 
simultaneous  to  a  stationary  observer  may  not  be 
simultaneous a moving observer. After all, it is surely 
causal links that are significant as far as interaction is 
concerned and these are specifically excluded from the 
world map. 
 
It  is  actually  desirable  to  foliate  spacetime  in  an 
alternative  way  to  eliminate  the  artificial  concept  of 
simultaneity and thus remove many of the conceptual 
difficulties  associated  with  Special  Relativity.  The 
interrelationship  between  events  on  the  new  surface 
should be unaffected by a change in inertial frame.  
 
Null geodesics are events that are causally connected 
to the observer§. The hypersurface of null geodesics is 
represented by the two angled lines (blue) in Figure 1. 
All  events  on  this  line  are  causally  connected  to  the 
observer  and  to  one  another  (in  the  direction  of 
positive time only). This spacetime slice is called the 
world view. It is proposed that this is a better way to 
slice spacetime because the property of connectedness 
that  all  events  in  the  world  view  share  is  largely 
maintained  following  a  velocity  transformation.  In 
simple  terms,  a  world  map  does  not  transform  to  a 
world  map  (transformations  of  inertial  frames  will 
preserve  the  velocity  of  light  but  will  not  preserve 
simultaneity),  but  a  world  view  does  transform  to  a 
world  view  (over  a  restricted  domain  and  range). 
Issues of measurement and how the same time can be 
maintained over the hypersurface no longer arise.  
 
All  events  in  the  past  and  future  that  are  causally 
connected  to  the  observer  will  be  referred  to  as  the 
causal  event  set.  The  world  view  is  a  subset  of  the 
causal  event  set  in  that  it  only  includes  retarded 
events. We will calculate how the causal event set is 
affected  by  a  velocity  transform  and  solve  some 
standard problems (including the twins problem) using 
this formalism. Of course, the results will be the same 
as derived in any standard Special Relativity textbook, 

                                                 
§ We will consider only the electromagnetic interaction in empty 
space which always propagates at velocity c. Causal contact  thus 
only refers to events that are relateded in this way.

e.g.  Muirhead  11;  neither  reference  frames  nor 
coordinate  system  have  been  altered  and  no changes 
have been made to the basic postulates. 
 
 
4. Interaction Continuity  
 
As will be seen later, the issue of continuity becomes 
important  when  a  causal  event  set 
is  Lorentz 
transformed. The question here is whether interacting 
systems  maintain  continuity  of  contact  through  an 
acceleration.  Consider  the  following  scenario:  An 
observer  A  is  at  rest  with  respect  to  entity  B,  a 
distance  x  away.  The  observer  receives  a  steady 
stream  of  photons  from  events  initiated  by  B.  The 
photons  are  received  at  times  ti  and  were  emitted  at 
times ti – x/c from B’s location. Contrast the situation 
where the observer is instantaneously accelerated at t 
=  0  and  the  situation  where  no  acceleration  takes 
place  (Figure  3).  We  can  imagine  the  photons  that 
were incident upon the unaccelerated observer at t = 0 
and  absorbed  at  t  =  0+,  an  infinitesimal  time 
afterwards. What will happen to these same photon(s) 
in the accelerated case? 
 

 

 

Figure 3   Photon incident on accelerated absorber

The  obvious  response  is  that  the  photon  is  still 
absorbed, and indeed we will explore this assumption 
fully  through  the  rest  of  the  paper.  The  implication 
then  is  that  interacting  systems  are  continuous  and 
irrespective  of 
causal

contact 
acceleration.  However 
three  other 
possibilities that do not violate energy conservation: 
 
(A)  The  photon  passes  through  the  absorber. 
This would be the case if an accelerated entity 
experiences a time discontinuity with respect to 
B.  For  a  short  interval,  A  is  not  is  causal 
contact.  The  photon  must  still  move  for  this 
time and will thus move through the location of 
the absorber as if it were not there. Effectively 
the  absorber  disappears¶.  This  is  an  unlikely 
possibility,  except  that  quantum  mechanically 
particles are known to pass through apparently 
impenetrable  barriers,  the  explanation  in  that 
case  being  the  borrowing  of  energy  by  the 
Uncertainty  Principle.  The  situation  here  is 
different and time discontinuities would surely 
have  been  noted  as  a  deviation  from  the 
predictions  of 
in  experiments 
relativity 
measuring  the  lifetime  of  accelerated  muons. 
Many materials  are  transparent to  photons but 
surely none so selectively as implied here. 

again 

seems 

(B)  The  photon  is  reflected  or  scattered  by  the 
absorber.  Does  an  accelerated  entity  act  as  a 
mirror?  This 
implausible. 
Classically, reflection takes place at a metallic 
surface  because  an  electric  field  cannot  exist 
within a metal – the mobile electrons in the free 
electron  gas  reconfigure  to  oppose  the  field. 
This imposes a boundary condition at or below 
the surface that gives rise to reflection. There is 
no  evidence  that  reflection  (or  scattering)  is 
associated with acceleration. 

(C)  Photons that would have arrived at that time 
are not emitted. A rather obvious explanation 
for quantum non-locality (the spooky collusion 
of  paired  photons  over  large  distances)  is  to 
state  that  photon  exchange  is  a  ‘prearranged’ 
transaction  between  emitters  and  absorbers. 
Photons are emitted only because the absorbers 
will be at the right place at the right time with 
the  correct  properties.  This  global  rather  than 
local view of the electromagnetic interaction is 
totally deterministic but gives rise to even more 
difficult  questions  than  are  solved  ¶.  For  a 
transactional  interpretation  of  this  type,  the 
notion of an emitted photon wandering through 
space  until  it  chances  upon  an  absorber  is 
considered 
transactional 
incorrect.  The 
interpretation  is  consistent  with  a  relationist 
view of space. Curiously the world view that is 
being  explored  here  eliminates  the  need  for  a 
propagation  medium  as  the  total  mass-energy 
on  each  surface  is  constant  over  time.  That  is 
not  the  case  with  the  world  map  –  a  photon 
emitted at t = 0 to be absorbed at t = t will leave 
a  mass-energy  discrepancy  at  the  times  in 
between. 

frame.  Whilst 

in  an  accelerated 

 
Of  all  the  possibilities,  the  most  plausible  is  that 
continuity  is  maintained.  This  is  equivalent  to  the 
statement  that  the  velocity  of  light  is  measured  as 
this 
constant 
assumption is taken forward, it should be born in mind 
that  it  may  be  incorrect  –  the  assumption  that  the 
effects of acceleration is instantaneous must surely be 
considered  further  to  determine  how  the  effect  of  a 
continuously  applied  force  can  be  partitioned  into 
discrete instantaneous accelerations. 
 
5. Definition of the Causal Event Set 
 
The  causal  set  of  events  is  defined  as  the  set  of  4-
vectors  of  all  events  causally  connected  to  the 
observer.  The  relationist  view  of  interaction  may  be 
incorporated  by  stating  that  events  can  only  be 
associated  with  particles.  The  event  set  can  be 
generalised 
to  consider  all  potential  events  by 
including  all  particles  at  the  particular  moment  of 
causal contact with the observer.  
 
The analysis can be developed in one space dimension 
without  loss  of  generality.  Consider  initially  the 
stationary  frame  (the  observer  rest  frame).  The 
observer  may  arbitrarily  be  assigned  a  fixed  space 
coordinate of x = 0. The proper time may be reset to t 
=  0  in  the  observer  frame.  All  points  in  the  frame 
share a common proper time and are stationary w.r.t. 
the observer. In general, each particle will contribute 
twice to  the causal  event set, once as an emitter and 
(retarded  and  advanced 
once  as  an  absorber 

                                                 
¶ The absorber is effectively destroyed then recreated at a later 
time, an uncomfortable concept to associate with all accelerations. 

                                                 
¶ For example, why can the probability function for spontaneous 
emission be correctly derived from the local Hamiltonian without 
reference to the distribution of distant absorbers?

may  include  reflection  paths.  If  the  condition  is 
imposed  that  each  slice  will  contain  at  least  one 
transaction,  it  is  clear  that  spacetime  is  sliced  into  a 
finite number of surfaces and that the foliation is not 
continuous. Of course it may be argued that surfaces 
with  no  energy  transfer  activity  should  still  be 
included  because  particle  positions  may  be  altering

6. The Lorentz Transform 
 
Let the observer be accelerated at t=0 to a velocity v 
instantaneously.  This  defines  the  moving  frame.  We 
will  make  the  following  assumption  (as discussed in 
Section 4): 
 
For any particle in causal contact with the observer at 
a time prior to an acceleration, a signal transmitted an 
arbitrarily small time after the acceleration can also be 
received by the accelerated observer. 
 
Before applying the transformations, the particles will 
be identified as being within one of two regions, xi ‡ 0 
and  xi  <  0,  to  eliminate  the  modulus  bars  and  make 
clear  the  difference between  the forward and  reverse 
directions after acceleration.  
 
At t = 0, members of the set of causally linked events 
transform as follows (v > 0) 11:

or  

the  event  (0, g(1-b)t) in the rest frame of the moving 
object  is  perceived to originate from the bridge point  
(vt/(1+b), t/(1+b)) by the observer. This is a member 
of  the  observer’s  causal  event  set  at  t  =  t.  Thus  for 
time  t  in  the  observer  frame,  a  lesser time g(1-b)t    = 
t/(1 + z) has elapsed in the moving frame, where 1+ z 
=  (1+b)1/2.(1-b)-1/2.  If  the  frequency  in  the  moving 
frame is f then the frequency will register as f /(1 + z) 
in  the  stationary  frame.  The  wavelength  increases 
hence we have a red shift for objects moving away. 
 
Of  course,  the  reciprocal  must  also  be  true:  the 
moving  observer  must  see  light  from  the  stationary 
observer  as  being  red  shifted  too.  This  is  easily 
demonstrated.  Again  from  Figure 5,  the bridge  point 
between  the  frames  is  (vt/(1+b),  t/(1+b)).  Photons 
received  by  the  moving  observer  will  be  part  of  the 
causal  event  set  of  the  bridge  point  NOT  of  the 
stationary  observer.  (This  change  is  key  to  the 
asymmetry). The stationary observer event that is part 
of the bridge causal set is

A time t ' = g(1-b)t in the moving frame is associated 
with    a  time  g(1-b)t'  in  the  stationary  frame.  The 
accelerated  observer  will  also  measure  an  identical 
redshift.  The  situation  is  perfectly  symmetrical  and 
there is no way of determining which was accelerated 
after acceleration is over. 
 
It  is  straightforward  to  demonstrate  that  photons 
immediately 
received 
acceleration 
wavelength-shifted.  Consider 
stationary 
spacecraft  A,  B  and  C  aligned  along  an  x-axis.  A 
sends a continuous stream of photons with energy E to 
B  who  immediately  relays  them  on  to  C  with  a 
transponder. If B is suddenly accelerated to a velocity 
v  away  from  A,  the  received  energy  immediately 
changes to E/(1 + z). This energy is passed onto C for 
whom  the  photon  is  blue-shifted  by  a  factor  (1+z). 
The  received  energy  is  therefore  E  as  expected,  the 
same as if spacecraft B were not there. In fact there is 
no way that a photon received directly from A can be 
distinguished from one relayed via a moving B could 
be  distinguished  by  spacecraft  C,  even  though  they 
were emitted with different energies. 
 
 
9. Discussion 
 
By referring to Figure 5, it has been shown that two of 
the standard applications of Special Relativity can be 
solved  trivially  using  the  causal  event  set  and  with 
results  that  are  totally  consistent  with  the  normal 
treatment.  There  are  however  conceptual  issues 
arising that need to be examined further. 
 
In  essence,  light  signals  that  before  an  acceleration 
had  originated from position  x (positive) and emitted 
at time -x/c appear, after acceleration at t = 0, to have 
originated  from  position g(1+b)x  at  time  -g(1+b)x/c. 
For  an  accelerated  object,  the  entire  spacetime  is 
instantly  reconfigured.  Following  acceleration,  the

It  is  important  to  recognise  that  the  events  sets  for 
each  observer  are  not  the  same  (as  demonstrated  in 
section 8). The advantage of the use of the causal set 
is that a connected path of light signals can be defined 
which can pass between frames and correspond to real 
world measurements. We will show now how this can 
be applied to typical problems. 
 
7. The Twin ‘Paradox’ 
 
Consider again the scenario where twins A and B are 
initially at rest on earth. Let there be a beacon at the 
distance star C, the ultimate destination of twin B. The 
beacon is sending out a stream of photons which are 
perceived by both twins to originate from a source at 
distance x. Following the instantaneous acceleration of 
twin  B,  the  top  half  of  Figure  5  (or  equation  (3)) 
shows that light from the beacon is now perceived to 
come from position g(1+b)x. Using equation (12), the 
time  taken  to  reach  the  beacon  is  found  by  dividing 
the  retarded  velocity 
the  retarded  position  by 
(remembering that the beacon is moving towards twin 
B):

twin B to reach the beacon from the viewpoint of twin 
A is simply

There  is  clearly  a  difference  in  the  elapsed  time  and 
there is no contradiction. The paradox disappears. The 
same  argument  can  be  used  to  show  that  the  return 
journey contributes a similar difference. 
 
Why then is the situation asymmetrical? It is because

8. Redshift 
 
The  redshift  is  easy  to  understand  with  reference  to 
the  causal  event  set.  No  calculation  is  required. 
Looking  at  the  bottom  half  of  Figure  5,  an  interval 
g(1-b)t in  the moving  frame is  causally linked to t in 
the stationary frame when the object is moving away -

retarded 
‘position’  of  all  previously  stationary 
particles  changes,  distances  being  expanded  in  the 
forward  direction  and  contracted  in  the  reverse 
direction.  This  is  a  global  and  instantaneous  change. 
Although  interaction  continuity  is  guaranteed  during 
the  acceleration,  a  space  discontinuity  results.  The 
instantaneous nature of the transformation is required 
if  the  particles  are  not  to  have  a  ‘memory’  of 
accelerations  and  we  can  actually 
the 
principle  of  relativity  with  the  fact  that  simple 
particles cannot maintain a memory of acceleration. 
 
The  second  important  point  is  that  received  photons 
are  redshifted  immediately  following  acceleration. 
Without absolute space  or absolute acceleration,  it  is 
difficult  to  see  how  this  can  be  compatible  with  a 
substantivalist view of spacetime.  

identify 

interpretation 

the  substantivalist 

The flexibility with which the space-time manifold is 
globally  transformed  would  suggest  that  a  relationist 
interpretation of space-time might be more appropriate 
than 
that  was 
assumed  at  the  beginning  of  the  analysis.  Because  a 
photon cannot convey information about the source as 
it propagates, we are forced to seriously reconsider the 
transactional mechanism described earlier – that is to 
say,  a  photon  transfer  involves  a  handshake  between 
the  emitter  and  receiver  and  does  not  depend  on  a 
propagation medium. Again this suggests a relationist 
interpretation  is  correct.  In  this  model,  the  speed  of 
light is not something that arises from the movement 
of  energy  in  spacetime  but  is  the  parameter  from 
which  spacetime  is  constructed  by  each  observer  to 
maintain the causal links between particles through an 
acceleration. 
 
This is not really a comfortable conclusion because of 
the new problems that arise. In addition to the points 
made in Section 4(C), there is the issue of the loss of 
information.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the  typical 
interaction process entails a high level of complexity, 
complexity  that  is  commonly  incorporated  into  the 
field. If space is removed, where does the complexity 
go?  It  is  surely  not  feasible  that  elementary  particles 
be conferred complex decision-making qualities¶. The 
only serious alternative is to assign the complexity to 
the Universe as a whole and attribute interaction to a 
holistic global mechanism in a universe consisting of a 
unity of particles in continuous causal contact. ‘Fields’ 
on  the  world  map  are  then  the  projection  of  four-
dimensional  interactions  onto  a  three  dimensional 
hypersurface. 
 
A  simple analysis can be performed to calculate how 
the retarded position of events changes with time for a 
body  subject  to  acceleration. If we consider  an  event 
at  retarded  position  xR  with an  acceleration,  a,  in  the 
direction  of  xR,  the  apparent  change  in  the  event 
position with time is (v positive)

For  v/c  <<  1,  if  we  consider  a  Universe  where  all 
velocity is a result of the Hubble expansion (v = Hox » 
x/T,  where  Ho  is  the  Hubble  constant  and  T  is  the 
current age of the universe) then the following choice 
of  acceleration  transforms  the  expanding  Universe 
into a static Universe:

Substituting  equation  (20)  into  equation  (19)  shows 
this  to  be  true  in  the  forward  direction.  It  is  easy  to 
verify 
that  this  is  true  for  all  directions.  The 
acceleration  can  thus  be  applied  in  any  direction  to 
effect the transformation.   
 
This  is  the  same  acceleration  that  is  considered 
significant in Milgrom’s alternative description of the 
gravitational force, MOND. Sanders and McGaugh in 
their  review  of  MOND12  deem  cHo 
to  be  a  
‘cosmologically interesting value’ of acceleration. 
 
 
10. Mach’s Principle 
 
Does  any  of  this  have  a  bearing  on  the  origin  of 
inertia? Mach’s principle states that in the absence of 
absolute  (or  any)  space  as  a  reference,  the  origin  of 
inertia  is  the  distant  stars  13.  One  aspect  of  inertia  is 
the resistance of a body to a change in motion. There 
have been many attempts to quantify the principle by 
considering the effect of motion on distant matter (for 
example  by  Sciama14),  all  of  which  predict  the  right 
magnitude of response. The unsolved problem is that 
the inertial reaction force acts instantaneously. How is 
the  effect  of  movement  on  distant  objects  going  to 
work its way back on the instant the force is applied to 
generate  an  equal  and  opposite  reaction  force?  One 
suggestion is the use of advanced and retarded waves, 
a  concept  introduced  by  Wheeler  and  Feynman15  to 
explain  electromagnetic  radiation  reaction,  but  this 
adds little to the transactional interpretation of energy 
transfer discussed earlier.   
 
If  for  the  moment  we  accept  an  instantaneous 
reconfiguration  does  take  place  with  acceleration;  is 
this  not suggestive  of inertia?  It  is  an  attractive idea, 
but an obvious mechanism for the reaction force does 
not  emerge  naturally.  The  distant  matter  is  displaced 
but only in the frame of the accelerated observer – the 
actual matter will only be aware of the acceleration in 
the  distant  future.  Certainly  the  reconfiguration  of 
spacetime will alter the gravitational potential. To get 
a  qualitative  overview  of  the  effect  this  might  have, 
consider  a  Universe  of  constant  density  comprising 
particles at rest. If the observer is boosted to a velocity 
v,  a  mass  element  originally  at  distance  x  in  the 
forward direction moves to position g(1+b)x. A mass 
element  originally  the  same  distance  away  in  the 
reverse  direction  moves  to  g(1-b)x.  The  distance 
between  the  two  points  has  increased  by  a  factor g. 
However,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  size  of  the 
observable universe has increased because, in reality, 
matter in the universe is not stationary. Objects at the 
boundary of the Universe are already moving a speed 
close  to  c  because  of  the  Hubble  expansion  of  the 
Universe:  a  small  velocity  boost  superimposed  in  a 
recession  velocity  close 
little  effect. 
Assuming that the mass elements are not significantly

This  is  of  the  same  magnitude  as  the  kinetic  energy 
gain of the accelerated observer if we adopt Sciama’s 
assumption14  that  the  gravitational  potential  (GM/x) 
divided by c2 is of the order one (certainly true if the 
current estimates for the baryonic mass and radius of 
the universe are slotted into the equation). The result 
though is unsatisfactory because GM/x must not alter 
with 
the  Copernican 
Cosmological Principle (the Universe is homogeneous 
and isotropic), although one could always side with an 
anthropic  ontology.  There  is  no  evidence  that  G  is 
changing  with  time16,  but  r  bar  can  remain  constant 
within  an  expanding  universe  so  long  as  mass  is 
aggregating  at  short  range  to  compensate  for  the 
outward movement of distant mass with time. This is 
then consistent with the cosmological principle, but is 
rather 
collaborative 
organisation on the part of the Universe is required to 
keep r bar constant. 
 
If,  in  spite  of  these  reservations,  we  can  accept  the 
calculation 
is 
straightforward  to  show  that  all  energy  may  be 
gravitational in origin. Consider an inelastic collision 
of  a  mass  m1  moving  at  velocity  v1  and  a  stationary 
mass m2. After collision, the first mass comes to a halt 
and  the  second  mass  moves  off  at  a  velocity  v2  = 
m1v1/m2  (conservation  of momentum).  From  equation

liberated from the gravitational potential is

exactly  as  expected  in  such  a  collision  (if  k  =  ½). 
Masses  appear  to  extract  kinetic  energy  from  their 
own frames through the gravitational potential. 
 
The  drawback  of  explaining  inertia  purely  as  the 
instantaneous redistribution  of matter  in the frame of 
the accelerated object is that the transformation effect 
is  independent  of  mass.  For  this  reason,  Sciama’s 
contention  that  inertia  is  related  to  the  gravitational 
force,  as  was  explored  above,  is  more  likely  to  be 
correct.

moving with respect to a gravitational source has been ignored, but

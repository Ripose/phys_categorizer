Abstract

The operator algebras of a new family of relativistic geometric
models of the relativistic oscillator [1] are studied. It is shown that,
generally, the operator of number of quanta and the pair of the shift
operators of each model are the generators of a non-unitary represen-
tation of the so(1, 2) algebra, except a special case when this algebra
becomes the standard one of the non-relativistic harmonic oscillator.

1 Introduction

In the general relativity, the geometric models play the role of kinematics,
helping us to understand the characteristics of the classical or quantum free
motion on a given background. One of the simplest (1+1) geometric models
is that of the (classical or quantum) relativistic harmonic oscillator (RHO).
Based on phenomenological [2] and group theoretical [3, 4] arguments, this
has been deﬁned as a free system on the anti-de Sitter static background.
There exists a (3+1) anti-de Sitter static metric [2] which can be restricted

1

to the (1+1) metric given by the line element

ds2 =

This metric reproduces the classical equation of motion of the non-relativistic
harmonic oscillator (NRHO) of the frequency ω. Moreover, the correspond-
ing quantum model, represented by a free scalar massive quantum ﬁeld, has
an equidistant discrete spectrum with a ground state energy larger, but ap-
proaching ω/2 in the non-relativistic limit (in natural units ¯h = c = 1) [5]. In
a previous article [1] we have generalized this model to the family of models
depending on a real parameter λ which has the metrics given by

ds2 = g00dt2 + g11dx2 =

1 + (1 + λ)ω2x2
1 + λω2x2

dt2

−

1 + (1 + λ)ω2x2
(1 + λω2x2)2 dx2.

Here, the parametrization has been deﬁned in order to obtain the exact anti-
de Sitter metric (1) for λ =
1. We have shown [1] that the quantum models
with λ > 0 have mixed energy spectra, with a ﬁnite discrete sequence and
a continuous part, while for λ
0 these spectra are countable. However,
despite of their diﬀerent relativistic behavior, all these models have the same
non-relativistic limit, namely the NRHO. For this reason we shall use the
name of relativistic oscillators (RO) for all the models with λ
1, under-
=
standing that the RHO is only that of the anti-de Sitter metric.

In this article, we intend to study the operator algebra of the quantum
0 and, therefore,

RO with countable energy spectra. For these models λ
it is convenient to denote

and to rewrite our previous results in this new notation. We take ǫ
that the pure anti-de Sitter RHO will have ǫ = 1.

≥

The energy spectra of our quantum models depend on only one quantum
number [1]. Therefore, we will have one operator of number of quanta and
a pair of shift (i.e. raising or lowering) operators. Our main objective is to
identify the algebra which is linearly generated by these operators. To this
end, ﬁrst we show that there exists a natural (holonomic) frame where the
relativistic energy eigenfunctions coincide with those of the non-relativistic
P¨oschl-Teller (PT) system [6, 7]. By using their known properties, we shall

2

6
construct the main operators which act on the one-particle wave functions,
giving a special attention to the three mentioned ones. The result is that
for all the RO with ǫ > 0, including the RHO, these are the generators of
the so(1, 2) algebra which has as Casimir operator just the Klein-Gordon
equation. In the limit ǫ
0 the so(1, 2) algebra degenerates in the standard
algebra of the NRHO.

→

We start, in the second section, with a short review of the properties of the
Hilbert space of one-particle states of the free quantum scalar massive ﬁeld
in the coordinate representation. In the next section we brieﬂy present our
previous results concerning the RO, giving the energy levels and the energy
eigenfunctions with their normalization factors. In the Sec. 4 we show that,
in the special frame where the metric is the conformal transformation of the
Minkowski ﬂat metric, the RO generates a relativistic PT problem for which
the shift operators of the energy basis are known [7]. Based on these results
we analyze, in the next section, the operator algebra of the models with
ǫ > 0, obtaining a non-unitary representation of the so(1, 2) algebra which is
equivalent to an unitary one. The case of ǫ = 0 is studied in the Sec. 6.

2 Preliminaries

Let us consider a static background with the natural frame (t, x) in which
the metric is gµν(x), with µ, ν = 0, 1. We shall assume that this is symmetric
with respect to x = 0 and we shall denote g = det(gµν). The domain, D, of
the free motion observed by an observer situated at x = 0 is that bounded
by the observer’s event horizon. In general, this is D = (
xe
in the case of
are either the ﬁnite points where the metric is singular or
the regular metrics. On this domain, we shall deﬁne the scalar ﬁeld φ of the
mass m, supposing that this is minimally coupled with the gravitational ﬁeld
[8]. In the case of static backgrounds the energy is conserved. Therefore, the
Klein-Gordon equation

Now we observe that, according to (5), the one-particle state space, H,
coincides to that of the antiparticle. In the coordinate representation this
is the space L2(D, µ) of the square integrable functions with respect to the
scalar product (7). All these functions must satisfy the condition

lim
x→±xe

U(x) = 0

. Moreover, when xe is ﬁnite then the metric
which is obvious for xe =
as well as the weight function µ are singular at
xe and, consequently, the
condition (9) is also necessary. A set of wave functions, Un, n = 0, 1, ..,

In general, any (1+1) static background admits a special natural frame,

metric. This new frame can be obtained by changing the space coordinate

and ˆµ(ˆx) = 1. Then, from (13) it results that the momentum operator
i∂ˆx
is selfadjoint. The state space H is represented now by L2( ˆD) where ˆD is
the domain of the new space coordinate corresponding to D. It is obvious
that both the spaces L2(D, µ) and L2( ˆD) come from the same coordinate
representation of the space H since the change of the continuous parameter
of a generalized basis changes only the normalization scale.

Let us ﬁrst discuss the general case of ǫ > 0 and then turn to the limit
0. In the frames (t, x), the metrics are given by (2) where we have to
ǫ
change the parameters according to (3). For the models with ǫ > 0 these
metrics are singular at

The quantum numbers, ns = 0, 1, 2... and s = 0, 1, can be embedded into
the main quantum number n = 2ns + s. This will take even values if s = 0

in the case of the RHO [5], when ǫ = 1.

We can conclude that our RO with ǫ > 0 are systems of massive scalar
particles conﬁned to wells. Their properties are determined by three param-
eters, m, ω and ǫ. This last one is our new parameter which gives the desired
well width, 2/ǫω, when the frequecy ω is ﬁxed. It is interesting that all these
parameters are concentrated in the expression of k so that the eigenfunctions
(18) depend only on ˆω = ǫω and k while the energies (23) involve all of
them. Thus there is a possibility to have RO with diﬀerent energy spectra
but having the same energy eigenfunctions.

On the other hand, we know that the functions (29) represent a complete
set of orthonormal functions in L2( ˆD). This means that the set Un, n = 0, 1, ..

5.2 The non-diﬀerential operators

However, there are other operators which are not diﬀerential. The anal-
ysis of their structure can be done by using the operators of the standard
oscillator algebra, a, a+ (with [a, a+] = 1) and N = a+a, which can be
deﬁned in the energy basis as follows:

a+Un = √n + 1Un+1,

aUn = √nUn−1, NUn = nUn.

Furthermore, from Eqs. (30) - (34) it results that these operators can be
expressed in terms of the generators of the standard oscillator algebra as

(48)

which is nothing else than the operator form of the Klein-Gordon equation,
as it results fom (30), (31) and (44).

Let us observe that the operators √2kA(+), √2kA(−) and N + k1 are
the generators of a non-unitary representation of the so(1, 2) algebra. This is
(non-unitary) equivalent with the unitary representation of the lowest weight
k, which has the generators

Finally we must specify that the operators ˆX and ˆP can be expressed
in terms of a and a+ by using the Eqs. (30), (31) and (48). However, we
can introduce other coordinate and momentum operators corresponding to
all the natural frames we desire to choose. Obviously, all these operators are
analytic functions of ˆX(a, a+) and ˆP(a, a+). Thus it results that the whole
operator algebra of the RO is freely generated by a and a+ only.

Hence, the conclusion is that the so(1, 2) algebra of the models with ǫ > 0

eigenfunctions as well as the shift operators are the same as those of the
NRHO. The unique diﬀerence is the formula of the energy levels which gives

7 Comments

In this article we have studied the properties of the fundamental solutions
of the Klein-Gordon equations of the RO by using the traditional methods
of the coordinate representation. This allowed us to study the form of the
energy eigenfunctions in two natural frames. The ﬁrst one, (t, x), is important
since here the classical equations of motion of the RO look like that of the
NRHO. This indicates that the physical meaning of the relativistic behavior
of the RO could be better point out in this frame. The other frame, (t, ˆx),
oﬀers the advantage of the simplest form of the Klein-Gordon equation (27).
We have shown that for ǫ > 0 this is the relativistic version of the PT system.
Moreover, we have seen that in the limit ǫ
0 both these frames coincide
while the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation become just those of the
NRHO. Thus we can conclude that, at least in the frame (t, ˆx), the space
behavior of the RO remains very closed to that of several non-relativistic
systems. However, the operators of physical interest have new properties and
speciﬁc and consistent, although quit complicated, commutation relations.
We must specify that our results concerning the commutation rules of the
energy, position and momentum operators diﬀer from those predicted in the
algebraic approach of the RHO [3]. What is remarkable here is that we have
recovered on an other way the so(1, 2) algebra, for all the RO with ǫ > 0,
so that the Klein-Gordon operator should be just its Casimir operator. As
mentioned, all these systems are of massive scalar particles conﬁned to wells
having the width 2/ǫω in the frame (t, x) or π/ǫω in the frame (t, ˆx).

Finally we note that all the results we have obtained could be the starting
point of the construction of the quantum ﬁeld theory of the scalar ﬁeld φ.
This must be deﬁned on H with values in the ﬁeld operator algebra by
introducing suitable creation and annihilation operators. Moreover, all the
operators we have discussed here will generate the one-particle operators of
the quantum ﬁeld theory. Then the physical meaning of these operators
will be better understood because of the possibility of analyzing their time
evolution with the help of the Hamiltonian operator. In our opinion, in this
way one could obtain new answers in some sensitive problems such as that
related to the deﬁnition of the relativistic position and momentum operators.

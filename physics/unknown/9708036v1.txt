Abstract

The integral representation on the orthogonal groups for zonal spherical func-
tions on the symmetric space SU (N )/SO(N, R) is used to obtain a generating
function for such functions. For the case N = 3 the three–dimensional integral
representation reduces to a one–dimensional one.

1 Introduction

The interest of studying classical and quantum integrable systems is always
increasing. These systems present some very nice characteristics which are
related to diﬀerent algebraic and analytic properties. For instance, the con-
nection of completely integrable classical Hamiltonian systems with semisim-
ple Lie algebras was established more than twenty years ago in [OP 1976] and
the relationship with quantum systems in [OP 1977].

On the other side, it was also shown in [OP 1978] and [OP 1983] the pos-
sibility of ﬁnding the explicit form of the Laplace–Beltrami operator for each

symmetric space appearing in the classiﬁcation given in the classical Helga-
son’s book [He 1978] by associating to it a quantum mechanical problem.

The search for the eigenfunctions of such operators is not an easy task.
These functions are but the so–called zonal spherical functions and for one
special case and for the case of symmetric spaces with root systems of the
type AN −1 were found explicitly in [Pr 1984].

Our aim in this letter is to present some remarks concerning the in-
tegral representation for zonal spherical functions on the symmetric space
SU(N)/SO(N, R). This representation will be used for obtaining a generat-
ing function for such zonal spherical functions.

We recall that if G is a connected real semisimple Lie group and T ρ de-
notes an irreducible unitary representation of G with support in the Hilbert
space H, where ρ is a parameter characterizing the representation, the rep-
resentation T ρ is said to be of class I if there exists a vector |Ψ0i such that
T ρ(k)|Ψ0i = |Ψ0i, for any element k in the maximal compact subgroup K
of G. The function deﬁned by the expectation value of T ρ is called a zonal
spherical function belonging to the representation T ρ. Zonal spherical func-
tions satisfy a kind of completeness condition like that of coherent states.

The paper is organized as follows. In order to the paper to be more self-
contained we give in Section 2 the general deﬁnitions and properties on zonal
spherical functions. The particular case N = 2 is considered in Section 3,
and then the formulae are extended in Section 4 to the case N = 3. Section 5
is devoted to introduce an integral representation for the generating function
for zonal spherical functions for the symmetric space SU(N)/SO(N, R) and
the integrals arising in the expresion are explicitly computed in the particular
cases N = 2 and N = 3.

2 Zonal spherical functions

Let G− = SL(N, R) be the group of real matrices of order N with deter-
minant equal to one. This group contains three important subgroups, to be
denoted K, A and N . The subgroup K = SO(N, R) is the compact group of
real orthogonal matrices, the subgroup A is the Abelian group of inversible
real diagonal matrices and N is the subgroup of lower triangular real matrices
with units on the principal diagonal, which is a nilpotent group.

Using the polar decomposition of a matrix, the homogeneous space X − =

2

G−/K can be identiﬁed with the space of real positive–deﬁnite symmetric
matrices with determinant equal to one. It is known that any element g ∈ G−
may be decomposed in a unique way as a product g = kan, with k ∈ K, a ∈ A
and n ∈ N , respectively, so-called Iwasawa decomposition. We denote the
elements in such a factorization as k(g), a(g) and n(g), i.e. g = k(g) a(g) n(g).
Correspondingly, the linear space underlying the Lie algebra g of G− can be
decomposed as a direct sum of the linear spaces of the Lie subalgebras k of
K, a of A and n of N , i.e., g = k ⊕ a ⊕ n. Let us also denote as a∗ the dual
space of a and so on.

There are natural left and right actions of group G− on K and N , re-
spectively, induced by left and right multiplication, respectively, which are
deﬁned by the formulae

kg = k(gk), ng = n(ng),

(2.1)

and for any λ ∈ a∗, we may construct the representation T λ(g) of the group
G− in the space of L2(K) or L2(N ) of square integrable functions on K or
N by the formula

[T λ(g) f ](k) = exp ((iλ − ρ, H(gk)) f (kg−1

),

or

[T λ(g) f ](n) = exp ((iλ − ρ, H(ng)) f (ng),

where H(g) is deﬁned by a(g) = exp H(g) and ρ is given by one half of the
sum of positive roots of the symmetric space X −,

ρ =

α.

This so called representation of principal series is unitary and irreducible.
It has the property that in the Hilbert space Hλ there is a normalized vector
|Ψ0i ∈ Hλ which is invariant under the action of group K:

Let us consider the function

T λ(k) |Ψ0i = |Ψ0i,

Φλ(g) = hΨ0| T λ(g) |Ψ0i.

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

This function is called a zonal spherical function and has the properties of

Φλ(k1gk2) = Φλ(g), Φλ(k) = 1, ∀k ∈ K, Φλ(e) = 1.

(2.6)

For the realization of Hλ as L2(K), we take |Ψ0i as the constant function

Ψ0(k) ≡ 1, and then we have the integral representation for Φλ(g):

Φλ(g) =

exp ((iλ − ρ, H(gk)) dµ(k),

dµ(k) = 1,

(2.7)

ZK

ZK

where dµ(k) denotes an invariant (under G−) measure on K. Note that due
to (2.6) the function Φλ(g) is completely deﬁned by the values Φλ(a), a ∈ A.
Here Φλ(g) is the eigenfunction of Laplace-Beltrami ∆j operators and cor-
j of these operators,

respondingly Φλ(a) is the eigenfunction of radial parts ∆0

Note that the analogous consideration of groups G− = SL(N, C) and
G− = SL(N, H) over complex numbers and quaternions gives us the corre-
sponding integral representations for κ = 1 and κ = 2.

Note that the above construction is also valid for the dual spaces X + =
G+/K, where G+ = SU(N) is the group of unitary matrices with determi-
nant equal to one. In this case the representation T λ(g) is deﬁned by a set
l = (l1, . . . , lN −1) of (N − 1) nonnegative integer numbers lj and the integral
representation (2.7) takes the form

Φl(g) =

exp(l, H(gk)) dµ(k),

dµ(k) = 1,

The element k of the group SO(N, R) is the matrix (kij) and may be
considered as the set of N unit orthogonal vectors k(j) = (k1j, . . . , kN j) from
which we may construct the set of polyvectors

k(i), k(i1,i2) = k(i1) ∧ k(i2), k(i1,i2,i3) = k(i1) ∧ k(i2) ∧ k(i3), · · · .

(2.11)

There is a natural action of the group G on the space of polyvectors and

the integral representation (2.9) may be written now in the form

Φl(x1, . . . , xN ) =

If we put x1 = eiθ, x2 = e−iθ, then Φl(x1, x2) = AlPl (cos θ), where Pl(cos x)
is the Legendre polynomial.

These formulae may be easily extended to the N-dimensional case. Namely,

we have

For vectors n and m the standard parametrization through Euler angles ϕ, θ

a = (− sin ϕ, cos ϕ, 0), b = (− cos ϕ cos θ, − sin ϕ cos θ, sin θ) (4.3)

with dµ(k) = dµ(n, m) = A sin θ dθ dϕ dψ, and in the preceding expression
we have a three–dimensional integral which may be calculated using the
generating functions.

5 Generating functions

Let us deﬁne the generating function by the formula

F (x1, x2, . . . , xN ; t1, . . . , tN −1) =

Then we have the integral representation

F (x1, x2, . . . , xN ; t1, . . . , tN −1) =

(1 − Ξj(x; k)tj)]−1 dµ(k).

(5.2)

Let us introduce the coordinate system such that a and b are two unit
orthogonal vectors in the two–dimensional plane orthogonal to the set of
vectors {k(1), . . . , k(N −2)}. Then, an arbitrary unit vector n in this plane has
the form cos ψ · a + sin ψ · b, and we may integrate ﬁrst on dµ(n). The integral
representation (5.2) takes the form:

F (x1, x2, . . . , xN ; t1, . . . , tN −1) =

[Aijninj]−1 dµ(N −2)(k) dµ(n).

(5.3)

The integral on dµ(n) may be easily calculated and we have

F (x1, x2, . . . , xN ; t1, . . . , tN −1) =

[D]−1/2 dµ(k(1), . . . , k(N −2)),

(5.4)

where D = det(Aij), Aij = Aij(x; k(1), . . . , k(N −2)).

In the simplest case N = 2, we have

F (x1, x2; t) = [(1 − x1t)(1 − x2t)]−1/2,

(5.5)

from which the formula (3.7) for Φl(x1, x2) follows.

In the case N = 3, the integration on dµ(ψ) gives

F (x1, x2, x3; t1, t2) =

B−1(n)C −1/2(n) dµ(n),

dµ(n) = 1,

We can now integrate on dµ(n) and ﬁnally we obtain the one–dimensional

j t2 − t1t2). (5.12)

(5.13)

where a0 = 1 + (1 − ξ2)t1t2, τ1 = (1 − ξ2)t1, τ2 = (1 − ξ2)t2. Note that from
(5.13) it follows that the integral (5.11) is elliptic and it may be expressed in
terms of standard elliptic integrals.

Expanding F (x1, x2, x3; t1, t2) in power series of the variable t2 one obtains

A numerical study of normal glow discharge properties was performed in the case of small 

electrodes  separations  (0.05  –  0.4  cm)  and  moderate  gas  pressures  (10  -  46  Torr).  A 

recently  observed  new  experimental  effect  of  a  considerable  reduction  in  the  normal 

current  density  for  smaller  discharge  lengths  was  analyzed  both  by  means  of  2D  fluid 

model  and  by  a  minimal  1D  drift  model  of  gas  discharge.  A  good  agreement  between 

theoretical and experimental behaviour was demonstrated. An influence of the electrodes 

separation and of the gas heating on the value of the normal current density is discussed.

Introduction 

 

The normal glow discharge investigation history spans more than a century thus one could 

expect that this is one of the best-studied subjects in modern physics. Still, in a variety of 

conditions  and  applications  where  normal  discharges  are  used  (e.g.  lighting,  plasma 

processing  and  laser  pumping)  the  physics  of  the  normal  glow  discharge  remains  an 

intensively discussed issue. 

According  to  the  generally  adopted  view  [1,2],  a  diffusive,  self-sustained  discharge 

between two parallel plane electrodes can be classified as follows: at very small currents 

(a few µA or less) when the space charge does not affect the electric field distribution, the 

discharge  occupies  the  whole  electrode  surface.  Such  discharge  is  called  a  Townsend 

discharge. The sustaining voltage is equal to the breakdown voltage and does not change 

with the current. As the current gradually increases the influence of space charge becomes 

more  pronounced  and  the  discharge  begins  to  contract.  The  slope  of  the  voltage-current 

characteristic  in  this  regime  is  negative  (causing  instabilities).  This  discharge  is  called 

subnormal.  When  the  current  density  reaches  a  certain  value,  with  a  further  current 

increase the discharge begins to spread again. While the total current increases, the current 

density  and  voltage  remain  constant.  This  is  known  as  the  “normal”  discharge  and  is 

characterised  by  the  so-called  normal  current  density,  the  normal  voltage  drop  and  the 

normal cathode layer thickness. As soon as the current spot on the cathode will cover the 

whole surface of the electrode, the voltage will start to rise again with a further increase in 

current. This is known as the “abnormal" regime. For small values of the pd parameter (pd 

< pdc, were pdc is usually in order of 1 Torr.cm) a normal phase does not exist and a direct 

transition from Townsend to abnormal discharge, with increasing current, occurs. In this 

case the discharge will always occupy the whole electrode surface.  

The development of micro-discharges for UV light sources, plasma display elements or as 

active medium for gas lasers recently led to a renewed interest in discharges occurring in 

short gaps at elevated gas pressures. It appears that there is a lack of information on glow 

discharges in discharge gaps with the pd value in the order of pdc and with the discharge in 

a transient  state between “subnormal” and “normal”. Moreover in relation to the  present 

interest for bifurcation phenomena in gas discharges, the relaxation to a “normal glow” at 

low  pd  values  can  be  considered  as  an  important  mechanism  for  structured  discharge 

formation  [3].  The  process  of  normal  cathode  spot  appearance  is  important  not  only  for 

 

2

continuous wave (direct current) operation, but for pulsed or alternating current (AC) and 

barrier discharges as well. The transition from Townsend to normal discharge was already 

studied  in  a  number  of  theoretical  and  experimental  articles  [4,5,6,7,8].  However  these 

papers are not focused on the properties of the normal discharges itself.  

The  most  important  scaling  parameter  characterizing  a  normal  discharge  is  the  reduced 
normal current density Jn/p2, where Jn is the normal current density and p the pressure. It is 
believed (see for instance [1]) that the value of Jn/p2 is solely dependent on both the gas 

and electrode material and is independent of the discharge length. It should be noted that 

the theoretical verification is based on the classical, one-dimensional theory of the cathode 
layer developed in the first half of 20th century by von Engel and Steenbeck [9]. However, 
as we found in recent experiments [10], Jn/p2 becomes dependent on the discharge length, 

when the distance between the electrodes is in order of the negative glow length. 

The classical discharge model was further developed by Ward in the late 50s - early 60s 

[11,12].  Ward  performed  one  of  the  first  numerical  investigations  of  the  gas  discharge, 

making  self-consistent  calculations  of  the  electric  field  and  drift  current.  However  this 

work was by far complete and no special investigation was done to study the behaviour of 
the  Jn/p2  value  versus  the  pd  parameter.  The  recent  comprehensive  analytical  and 

numerical analysis of the 1-dimensional discharge model done in [3] reveals new types of 

voltage-current  characteristics  at  low  pd  values.  However,  the  normal  current  behaviour 

was not studied in this work.  

It is important to note that within the 1-dimensional model the normal current density can 

not be calculated directly. It is generally accepted to follow the assumption, made by von 

Engel and Steenbeck, that the normal current corresponds to the abscissa of the minimum 

on  the  calculated  voltage-current  characteristic.  However  this  assumption  remains  a 

constantly argued issue (see [1]) and is not proven yet. Strictly speaking the formation of 

the  normal  current  spot  is  at  least  a  two-dimensional  effect  so  its  description  requires 

adequate models.   

One of the earliest two-dimensional numerical study of the normal discharge in nitrogen 

was  done  by  Raizer  and  Surzhikov  in  [13].  At  that  time  2D  calculations  were  very  time 

consuming but even this somewhat incomplete  two-dimensional  modelling  contributed  a 
lot to a deeper insight on the process of the normal current spot formation [1]. 

More recent numerical investigations of the normal discharges and of the transition from 

Townsend to normal regimes for a pd range of 1-10 Torr cm were presented in [4,5]. The 

numerical  study  done  in  [4]  with  a  2D  fluid  model  both  with  a  local  and  non-local 

 

3

ionization term was mainly focused on the low current Townsend and subnormal regimes. 

In  the  same  article  a  comprehensive  semi-analytical  model  of  the  current  spot  was 

proposed. Particularly it was predicted that existence region of the normal current spot can 

be extended to lower pd values if secondary emission is a growing function of the electric 

field  [4].  In  [5]  the  applied  numerical  model  of  the  discharge  is  similar  to  the  one 

described  in  the  present  work,  but  without  accounting  for  gas  heating.  It  will  be  shown 

below  that  gas  heating  can  significantly  influence  the  properties  of  normal  discharge 

especially at moderate gas pressures. The modelling in [5] was performed for a discharge 

in  Ar  at  a  fixed  inter-electrode  distance  of  1  cm  and  for  two  different  values  of  the  gas 

pressure (3 and 6 Torr). By increasing the discharge current a transition from Townsend to 

subnormal, to normal and to an abnormal discharge was followed. Additionally subnormal 

oscillations  were  investigated.  Nevertheless  from  the  results  presented  in  [4,5]  it  is 

difficult  to  make  a  conclusion  about  the  behaviour  of  the  normal  current  density  in  the 

vicinity of the value pdc, therefore an additional investigation is needed.  

Despite the impressive development of gas discharge models, especially during last years, 

such a fundamental parameter as the normal current density was not studied in detail. So, 

the  knowledge  on  the  normal  current  density  behaviour  and  its  scaling  properties  hardly 

changed  since  the  classical  discharge  model  was  proposed  by  von  Engel  and  Steenbeck 

seventy  years  ago.  This  situation  is  also  caused  by  the  lack  of  new  experimental 

information on the subject.   

In the present work a two-dimensional fluid model of the discharge was applied to analyse 

the  recent  experimental  results  [10].  At  the  same  time  we  made  calculations  using  the 

classical  discharge  model  [11]  in  order  to  see  if  a  minimal  approach  to  discharge 

modelling can reflect the newly observed behaviour of the normal current density versus 

pd.  It  should  be  additionally  noticed  that  although  in  this  work  we  are  considering  the 

same range of pd parameter as in [4,5], here it corresponds to the case of small electrode 

separations  and  moderate  gas  pressures.  These  conditions  are  interesting  for  many 

nowadays applications of glow discharge. 

Modelling 

 

 

 

 

The  primary  goal  of  the  model  developed  here  was  to  investigate  if  the  experimentally 

observed  decrease  of  the  normal  current  density  with  the  gap  length  at  short  electrode 

4

distances [10] can be understood by means of one of the standard approaches that have so 

far  been  used  to  simulate  gas  discharges.  It  is  known  that  discharges  in  rare  gases  are 

influenced in their qualitative behaviour by impurities. The experiments described in [10] 

were  carried  out  without  gas  flow  thus  a  contamination  of  the  gases  used  in  these 

experiments is not excluded. That is why we decided to model a discharge in air for the 

sake  of  quantitative  comparison  with  experimental  data.  Additionally,  we  made 

calculations of the normal current densities at low pd values, utilizing Ward’s 1D minimal 

model of the gas discharge [11]. 

A  fully  spatial  dependent  simulation  of  the  discharge  geometry  with  rectangular-shaped 

electrodes  used  in  [10]  would  require  a  3  dimensional  model  in  Cartesian  co-ordinates. 

However,  as  it  follows  from  the  measurements  [10],  the  values  of  the  normal  current 

density are independent on the electrode width. At the same time it is important to show 

by means of modelling that the dependency of the normal current density on the discharge 

length is not exclusively a property of the discharge geometry applied in [10]. From this 

consideration for our modelling we have chosen a more general 2D cylindrical geometry, 

keeping gas pressure and electrode separation corresponding to [10] 

According  to  the  numerical  results  of  kinetic  simulations  [4]  the  assumption  of  a  local 

dependency of the ionisation coefficient on the electric field is a good approximation for 

subnormal discharges, while for normal discharges at pd ranges of 1-10 Torr.cm the non-

local nature of the ionisation coefficient becomes more pronounced. In our modelling we 

are  using  a  drift-diffusion  approximation  where  the  ionisation  coefficient,  electron 

mobility and electron diffusion coefficient are functions of the mean electron energy. This 

approach  still  allows  accounting  for  “small”  non-local  effects.  The  possible  influence  of 

run-away electrons on the discharge characteristics remains out of consideration. 

A 3-moment drift-diffusion fluid equation set (see Appendix A and [14]) was applied for 

modelling of the normal discharge in air in a two-dimensional cylindrical geometry. The 

corresponding set of equations includes the continuity equations for electrons and positive 

ions,  the  equation  for  the  mean  electron  energy,  the  Poisson  equation  for  the  electric 

potential, and the gas thermal conductivity equation.  

Though  in  general  the  electron  energy  distribution  function  (EEDF)  hardly  resembles  a 

Maxwellian one, according to ref. [14], it is possible to introduce the mean electron energy 

as the main characteristic of the distribution function and to consider all of the coefficients 

as  being  dependent  only  on  this  mean  energy.  To  derive  the  mean  electron  energy,  a 

corresponding equation that takes into account the energy loss, the gain and the electron 

 

5

heat conduction has to be solved (A4). The rate and transport coefficients as functions of 

the  mean  electron  energy  are  determined  beforehand  by  numerical  solving  the  0D 

Boltzmann  equation  for  the  EEDF.  Then  these  dependencies,  in  the  form  of  tabulated 

functions,  are  used  for  resolving  equation  set  A1-A12.  This  approach  requires  the 

assumption  that  these  rates  and  coefficients  depend  on  the  mean  electron  energy  in  the 

same way as they do in the equilibrium condition, when the local electron energy losses 

are balanced by the local energy gain [14]. 

For  a  discharge  in  air  as  well  as  for  discharges  in  atomic  gases,  at  different  pressures  a 

similar behaviour of the normal current density versus electrode separation was observed 

[10]. On the basis of these experimental observations it can be assumed that this behaviour 

is  not  directly  related  to  volumetric  processes  as  recombination  or  electron  attachment. 

Therefore in our model we are limiting ourselves to a simple source term in the continuity 

equations including only one ionization process. Certainly, an in depth numerical study of 

a discharge in air would require accounting also for negative ions and for various plasma-

chemical reactions but this is not the aim of the present work. 

According  to  our  calculations  in  the  studied  range  of  temperatures,  the  temperature 

dependency  of  the  thermal  conductivity  coefficient  λ  can  be  approximated  by  a  linear 

function. (See Appendix A7). 

Firstly we calculated the tabulated dependency of the thermal conductivity coefficient on 

the  gas  temperature  and  then  deduced  the  coefficients  A  and  B  for  the  linear  function 

(A7). Further, it was assumed that there is no convective gas flow in the discharge volume 

and that the local density can be determined from the ideal gas equation.         

Our numerical method is based on an exponential discretisation scheme [15] of the drift-

diffusion equations on a non-equidistant mesh. The transport and Poisson equations were 

integrated successively in time. Discretisation of the Poisson and continuity equations on a 

two  dimensional  grid,  results  in  5-points  linear  systems  that  were  solved  with  the  SIP 

(strongly implicit procedure) method [16]. Starting from initial conditions the evolution of 

the discharge parameters were advanced in time till a stationary solution was reached. A 

semi-implicit  representation  of  the  source  terms  in  the  Poisson  and  electron  energy 

equation [17] was used to allow larger time steps.  

The  discharge  was  modelled  in  a  cylindrical  numerical  domain  with  a  radius  of  0.7  cm. 

(The lateral size of this domain is not important as long as the cathode spot is smaller than 

the domain). The distance between the electrodes was chosen in the range of 0.5 to 4 mm. 

 

6

Various non-equidistant meshes were used to ensure that the grid size does not affect the 

value of calculated normal current density (like it was observed in [13]).  

The kinetic coefficients for electrons were calculated with the freeware BOLSIG program 

[18]. For the discharge in air we assumed a gas mixture of N2 : O2 : Ar = 78 : 21 : 1; the 

gas  pressure  in  our  calculations  was  varied  from  10  to  46  Torr.  The  mobility  of  the 
positive ions was taken as 1.5 cm2/(V sec) which corresponds to a gas density of 2.69 1019 
cm-3. A value of 0.1 was taken for the secondary ion–electron emission coefficient γ. The 

dependency  of  the  gas  thermal  conductivity  coefficient  λ  [W/cm  K]  on  the  temperature 
(see Appendix A7) was approximated with Aair = 5.5 10-7, Bair = 1.18 10-4. 

It  should  be  noticed  that  the  dependency  of  the  effective  secondary  electron  emission 

coefficient γ on the electric field value at the cathode is now an intensively discussed issue 

[5,19,20] and can significantly influence the results of the fluid model [5,17]. According to 

a  recent  comprehensive  analysis  [19]  various  mechanisms  such  as  ion  or  electron 

emission, photo-emission by resonance photons, emission caused by meta-stables and fast 

atoms contribute to the total effective electron emission from the cathode. The influence of 

each process is dependent on the value of the E/N parameter on the cathode as well as on 

the state (“clean” or “dirty”) of the cathode surface. If one considers only the process of 

secondary ion-electron emission then γ is a fast growing function of the E/N parameter at 

low E/N values but it reaches a constant value at high E/N. The nature of this functionality 

has  its  origin  in  the  effect  of  electron  back-scattering  towards  the  cathode.  This 

dependency can considerably affect the sustaining voltage of the Townsend discharge and 

the  properties  of  the  subnormal  discharge.  It  also  shifts  the  minimal  pd  at  which  the 

normal  discharge  can  exist  to  the  lower  values.  Yet  because,  the  γ  dependency  on  the 

electric  field  is  unknown  for  a  discharge  in  air,  we  have  decided  to  use,  for  a  first 

modelling, a constant γ and thus do not take into account back-scattering effects. A study 

of  the  influence  of  the  variation  of  γ  with  the  electric  field  will  be  a  subject  for  further 

investigation.  

The  equation  set  for  the  1-dimensional  classical  drift  model  is  listed  in  Appendix  B. 

Taking  into  account  the  continuity  equation  for  the  drift  current  and  the  electrostatic 

equation  for  the  electric  field  results  in  two  first  order  differential  equations.  The 

numerical solution of system (Appendix B: B1-B3) is performed by a “shooting” method 

where an initially chosen electrical field value at the cathode (or anode) is varied until the 

boundary  conditions  (B3)  are  met.  For  the  calculation  of  the  normal  current  density  the 

 

7

generally  accepted  assumption  that  normal  current  corresponds  to  the  minimum  on  the 

calculated voltage current characteristic was used. 

The input parameters for the 1D drift model are as follows: the mobility of positive ions 

and the  secondary  electron emission coefficient were taken the same as for the 2D fluid 
model.  The  mobility  of  the  electrons  was  chosen  as  434  cm2/(V  sec)  at  a  gas  density  of 
2.69 1019 cm-3 (according to the results of the BOLSIG code [18] for a N2 - O2 - Ar gas 

mixture  and  4  eV  electron  energy).  Two  cases  were  considered  for  the  Townsend’s 

ionization  coefficient.  In  the  first  case  the  ionization  coefficient  was  calculated  as  a 

function  of  the  reduced  electric  field  E/p  and  then  used  as  a  tabulated  function.  In  the 

second case according Raizer’s textbook [1] an exponential approximation was used (see 

Appendix B4; with s = 1, C= 15, D = 365 for air ). 

The  current  density  profiles  calculated  with  the  2D  fluid  model  at  the  cathode  for  a 

discharge  length  of  1  mm  are  presented  in  Fig.  1  for  three  different  values  of  the  total 

discharge current I = 7, 12 and 17 mA. One can see that a characteristic normal cathode 

spot  is  formed  with  a  uniform  current  density  in  the  centre  and  rather  steep  edges.  Also 

can be seen that an increase of the discharge current results in a larger cathode spot, while 

the current density (and voltage drop) remains the same. 

The  experimental  [10]  and  different  theoretical  dependencies  of  the  reduced  normal 
current  density  Jn/p2  versus  pd  parameter  are  presented  in  Fig.  2.  One  can  see  that  the 

reduced  normal  current  density  decreases  for  smaller  discharge  gaps  in  all  theoretical 

curves. The calculation is done for different gas pressures and the results are presented in 

this figure for 10, 20 and 46 Torr. In order to illustrate the influence of gas heating some 

calculations were done without the effect of gas heating, for a constant gas temperature of 

290 K (curves 4 and 5). The results obtained using the 1D drift model are plotted for two 

different ionisation coefficient approximations. An analysis of these results can be found 

in discussion section.  

The contour maps of the equi-potential lines for a normal discharge in air at 20 Torr and 

for electrode separations of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mm calculated with the 2D model are presented 

in Fig.3 (a-d). It can be seen that with the reduction of the inter-electrode gap, while the 

normal  current  density  decreases  (see  also  Fig.2,  curve  2)  the  length  of  the  cathode  fall 

region increases.  

In Fig.4 (a-d) the calculated contour plots for constant ionization rates (source term in the 

continuity equation A1: ki(ε)neN  [cm-3 / sec]) are shown for different discharge lengths, 

 

8

corresponding to potential distribution at Fig.3 (a-d). It can be seen that for  the smallest 

electrode separation of 0.5 mm (pd = 1 Torr cm) when the normal current spot still exist 

the cathode fall length (Fig.3(a)) as well as the high ionization region (Fig.4(a)) become of 

the  same  order  as  discharge  gap.  It  should  be  noted  though  that  already  for  an  inter-

electrode  distance  of  1  mm  (pd  =  2  Torr  cm)  both  the  cathode  voltage  fall  length  and 

length of the region where the main ionization occurs are significantly smaller than total 

discharge  length,  yet  the  current  reduction  is  still  apparent  for  this  electrode  separation 

(see  Fig.2,  curve  2).  Therefore  the  existence  of  the  normal discharge  is  limited  by  a  pdc 

value which is in order of cathode fall dimension pdn. At the same time the dependency of 

the normal current density on the electrode separation can be seen for a range of pd values 

which significantly exceeds pdn.  

Discussion 

In [10] it was observed that the normal current density depends on the distance between 

the  electrodes  in  the  pd  range  of  a  few  Torr.cm:  the  Jn  decreases  with  reduction  of  the 

discharge  length.  For  increasing  discharge  length  the  normal  current  density  attains  a 

constant  value.  It  seems  that  this  dependency  on  discharge  length  is  of  general  nature 

because it was observed for different gases, pressures and electrode materials.  

So far it was commonly assumed that the normal current density does not depend on the 

discharge length. This assumption was mainly based on a classical, semi-analytical model 

of  the  normal  cathode  layer  proposed  by  von  Engel  and  Steenbeck  [9]  (some  aspects  of 

this theory are discussed in [1]). In their model the field distribution inside the discharge 

was  approximated  by  a  linear  function.  The  absolute  value  of  the  electric  field  linearly 

reduces  from  E  =  E0  at  the  cathode  surface  (x  =  0)  to  E  =  0  at  x  =  ds,  where  ds  is  the 

sheath  thickness.  For  x  >  ds  the  electric  field  is  assumed  to  be  zero.  The  ionisation 

coefficient  was  dependent  on  the  local  value  of  the  electric  field.  From  such 

approximation  immediately  follows  that  the  sheath  properties  are  independent  on  the 

discharge length if the distance between the electrodes is larger than the sheath thickness.  
In  the  drift  model  developed  by  Ward  [11]  no  ‘a  priori’  given  electric  field  profile  was 

implied.  Nevertheless  the  calculated  field  inside  the  cathode  fall  region  was  well 

approximated  by  a  linear  function  which  was  in  agreement  with  the  experimental 

observations and confirming the previous assumption made by von Engel and Steenbeck 

[9]. At the same time the resulting electric field was at no place across the discharge gap 

9

 

 

 

zero,  because  this  is  a  strict  requirement  for  the  drift  current  continuity.  As  it  was 

mentioned  in  the  introduction  Ward’s  model  for  a  long  time  remained  insufficiently 
analysed.  Particularly  this  is  valid  for  the  dependency  of  the  Jn/p2  parameter  on  the 

discharge length. Our calculations show that the current density, which corresponds to the 

minimum  on  the  voltage-current  curve  (attributed  to  the  normal  regime),  shifts  toward 

lower  values  for  shorter  discharge  lengths  (see  curves  (6)  and  (7)  in  Fig  5).  This 

dependency coincides with the one found in our experiment. It should be noted here that a 

one dimensional model can not directly describe the normal current spot. However, even 

such a simple discharge simulation approach gives already a valuable indication about the 
functionality between Jn/p2 value and the inter-electrode distance. 

In comparison with the classical one dimensional approach the 2-dimensional fluid model 

applied  here  is  accounting  for  the  drift-diffusion  transport  of  the  charged  particles  in  a 

self-consistent 2D electrical field and also is characterised by the non-local ionization and 

transport coefficients which depend on the mean electron energy value.     

A two-dimensional analysis is essential for the description of the radial behaviour of the 

cathode spot. According to [4] the shape of current spot is governed by the ion drift in the 

radial electric field for normal discharges and the radial electron diffusion for subnormal 

discharges.  The  last  regime  is  characterized  by  considerably  lower  current  densities  in 

comparison with the normal discharge. The reduction in electrode separation for a normal 

discharge  leads  to  a  decrease  in  the  radial  electric  field  component  at  the  current  spot 

boundary  (see  Fig.3).  The  shape  of  current  spot  for  a  shorter  discharge  length  is  to  a 

greater extent governed by electron diffusion which is a fast process. If the voltage current 

characteristic of such short discharge still has a minimum, then a normal regime may exist, 

but it will have a lower current density.  

Two arguments should be considered when analyzing the results of the present numerical 

modelling concerning the normal current density behaviour. Firstly, already the simple 1D 
drift model gives a dependency of the Jn /p2 parameter on the discharge length which is a 

consequence  of  the  self-consistent  solution  for  the  transverse  field  and  drift  current. 

Secondly,  for  different  electrode  separations  the  balance  conditions  at  the  current  spot 

boundary are changing, resulting, in turn, to a change in the sustained current density.  

The  influence  of  gas  heating  on  the  normal  current  density  can  be  seen  by  comparing 

curves (2) and (4) in Fig 5, calculated respectively with and without taking into account 
the  effect  of  gas  heating.  Gas  heating  leads  to  a  decrease  of  the  J/p2  parameter.  The 

reduction becomes significant at higher currents (and consequently higher heating rates). 

 

10

This effect can be understood by the fact that the current density J scales not as J/p2 but, 
more precisely, is proportional to the square value of the gas concentration (N2).  With  a 

constant gas pressure a higher gas temperature results in a lower gas density and therefore 
lower current density. The same reason is valid for the deviation from the J/p2 scaling for 

the  curves  calculated  for  different  gas  pressures  (see  curves  (2)  and  (3)  in  Fig.2).  When 
gas  heating  is  not  taken  into  account  the  J/p2  scaling  holds  (see  curves  (4)  and  (5)  in 

Fig.2).  

It can be also seen  from  Fig.2 that  the calculated  curves  (2)  and  (3)  are  reproducing  the 

experimental behaviour (curve (1)) very well, although having a lower absolute value of 
the J/p2 parameter. This difference between curves (1) and (3) is approximately of factor 

of 2. This can be attributed to the simplicity of the applied model which did not take into 

account  attachment  and  recombination  processes.  It  should  be  also  noted  that  the 

calculations  and  experiments  were  done  for  different  discharge  geometries.  It  can  be 

expected,  according  to  Fig.2,  that  different  regimes  of  heat  removal  can  cause  a 

considerable variation in absolute values of current density.     

It  can  be  argued  that  fast  non-local  electrons  created  in  the  cathode  fall  are  producing  a 

significant  amount  of  ion-electron  pairs  in  the  negative  glow  which  can  extend 

considerably beyond the cathode fall region. In this case the reduction in discharge length 

will  diminish  the  electron  multiplication  while  the  electrode  separation  still  greatly 

exceeds the size of cathode voltage fall. A detailed study of the influence of fast electrons 

on the formation of the discharge with a certain value of the normal current density would 
require  a  pure  kinetic  or  hybrid  model  (see  for  instance  [21]).  This  will  be  a  subject  for 

further  investigation.  However  the  non-local  fluid  model  applied  in  the  present  work 

already gives a sufficiently good description of the experimental data. 

It is important to note that the fact, that the normal current density depends on the distance 

between the electrodes, imposes certain requirements on the experimental methodologies 
and set-ups for the measurement of “handbook” values of the Jn/p2 parameter. Therefore 

the results of previous measurements need to be analysed from this point of view.  

Summary 

 

 

 

The normal glow discharge was investigated numerically in a narrow gap geometry for a 

pd range of 1 - 10 Torr.cm at moderate gas pressures. A considerable reduction in current 

density  for  small  discharge  lengths  was  recently  experimentally  observed  in  [10]  for 

11

different  gases  and  electrode  materials.  It  was  found  that  such  fundamental  discharge 
similarity  parameter  as  reduced  normal  current  density  Jn/p2  becomes  a  function  of  the 
electrode  separation  at  low  pd  values.  While  it  was  traditionally  assumed  that  Jn/p2  is 

defined only by gas and electrode material. In present work this new effect was analyzed 
with a 3-moments 2D fluid model. The value of Jn/p2 was found to be strongly dependent 

on  discharge  length  in  the  case  when  gas  heating  is  neglected.  An  influence  of  the  gas 
heating  on  the  Jn/p2  value  and  scaling  properties  were  discussed.  A  good  qualitative 

agreement was shown between modelling and experimental results. It was also shown that 
already  a  minimal  1D  drift  discharge  model  can  give  an  indication  of  the  Jn/p2 

functionality  on  the  discharge  length.  We  believe  that  more  insight  on  the  effect  can  be 

gained by analysing the influence of the non-local ionization with a hybrid (kinetic-fluid) 

modelling which can be a subject for further investigation.

A symmetry condition was applied at the discharge axis at r = 0. Here γ is the secondary 

ion-electron  emission  coefficient, ε0  energy  of  the  secondary  electrons  (assumed  to  be  1 

eV), ve,th the thermal velocity of the electrons, Te the electron temperature, Qe the electron 

energy flux and σ the surface charge density. 

For  the  thermal  conductivity  equation  the  temperature  was  assumed  to  be  known 

(Dirichlet conditions) and equal to 290 K. 

A detailed description of the solution procedure for the continuity equations coupled with 

the Poisson equation in two dimensions can be found elsewhere (see for instance [14, 17] 

and references therein).

APPENDIX B   
 
1D drift model 
 
 
This set of equations is analogous to the one used by Ward [11] and can be derived from 

the continuity condition for the drift current and the electrostatic equation for the electric 

field. This results in a system of two first order differential equations:

Here Je and E are the electron current density and electric field respectively; J is the total 

current density; µp , µe  are the mobilities of ions and electrons; γ is the secondary electron 

emission coefficient and α is the Townsend’s ionization coefficient; z = 0 corresponds to 

the cathode and z = d to the anode location. 

For α usually an exponential (Townsend) approximation is used:

where the index s is typically equal to 1 or to 1/2.  

Following the original work [11] the solution of the system above is found by integrating 

(B1  and  B2)  over  the  discharge  gap  while  varying  the  assumed  electric  field  value  at 

cathode (or anode) till the boundary conditions (B3) are met. The value of the total current 

density  J  is  supposed  to  be  known.  Standard  library  routines  can  be  utilized  for 

integration, for instance, in the recent article [3] a reference is given to the ODE-PACK 

FORTRAN library from the freeware site: netlib.org. It should be noted that the solution 

of (B1-3) utilizing the described procedure is restricted to low values of current densities. 

In general the validity of the local model for higher currents in the abnormal branch of the 

voltage current characteristic is questionable.

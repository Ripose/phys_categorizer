Abstract 

The light transmission through perforated metal film has been studied both 
experimentally and theoretically. By taking account of plasma response of real metal 
on hole walls as well as metal surface, an analytical result for the transmission has 
been deduced, which agrees well with the experiments. The transmission involves 
both the diffraction modes and the surface plasmons. The surface plasmon polariton 
formed on the metal-dielectric interface gives rise to the transmission minima. 
Nevertheless, the cavity surface plasmons excited in the nanoholes contribute actively 
to the transmission enhancement. The results suggest a dual-effect of the surface 
plasmons.

Due to the unique dielectric response of metals, the interaction between the 
electromagnetic waves and artificially structured metals has been a subject of a wealth 
of theoretical and experimental work. For example, by using the periodic arrays of 
conducting wires and split-ring resonators, left-handed metamaterials have been 
constructed [1]. In recent years, resonant excitation of surface plasmon polariton (SPP) 
has sparked much attention [2]. Light that usually travels in a dielectric or vacuum is, 
due to coupling between light and surface charges, able to propagate along the metal 
surface with the amplitudes decaying into both sides. This unique feature has 
generated the SPP-based photonics or plasmonics. Plasmonics possessing both the 
capacity of photonics and miniaturization of electronics enables it to be an 
outstanding candidate for the future optoelectronic applications [3]. 

Besides the propagation of light along metal surface, the light propagation normal 

to the metal film is another interesting issue. When the film is optically thin (~ skin 
depth), the energy transfer can be enhanced by the SPP mode [4], and super-resolution 
imaging can be achieved [5]. And when the film thickness is much larger than the skin 
depth, the film will be completely opaque. However, it was found by Ebbesen et al. [6] 
that when subwavelength hole arrays are introduced into the metal film, a surprising 
effect appears. That is, the transmission of light thought to be very low can be larger

than unity when normalized to the area of the holes. This unusual transmission effect 
has generated great interest in the scientific community [7], partly due to its wide 
range of potential applications, including subwavelength light sources, enhanced 
nonlinear processes, and so on. 

The research on this issue also stems from the theoretical interest, as the physical 
origin of high transmission is still unclear. In such a metal system, the SPP mode can 
be produced by grating coupling and leads to strong enhancement of fields at the 
metal surface. Thus it is naturally and generally admitted that the SPP plays a crucial 
role [6, 8]. However, the experimental results such as the position of transmission 
peaks do not agree with the SPP model [8]. Even in a recent experiment [9], the 
indirectly deduced absorption cannot be attributed simply to the SPP mode since it 
occurs at all wavelengths (not only at the transmission maximum). On the other hand, 
no strong evidence for SPP has been presented theoretically. Previous analytical 
calculations bear a poor prediction of peak width as well as an obscure SPP 
interpretation [10]. Moreover, the numerical calculations which it is not easy to 
extract the underlying physics also deviate strongly from the experiments [11]. 
Therefore, the SPP mechanism has received a drastic debate [12-14]. These cases 
show that the underlying physics and the role of surface plasmons in the light 
transmission remains an open question rather than having been solved. 

In this paper, the light transmission and the role of surface plasmons will be 
studied. For the purpose, here experimentally used is an  h=220nm thick (much larger 
than the skin depth) gold film, which is coated by sputtering on the cross section of a 

single-mode optical fiber. Square holes arranged in a square array ( 1414m

m

m

m

) are 

fabricated in the film with the focused-ion-beam system (strata FIB 201, FEI company, 
30 keV Ga ions). The lattice constant and the hole side are determined respectively to 
be  d=580nm and  a=265nm, with a normalized area of the holes 20.9%. In the 
measurement, the incident light from an incoherent light source is coupled into the 
single-mode fiber for which the light can be considered to be incident normal to the 
metal film. And the zero-order transmission spectrum is obtained with an 
optical-spectrum analyzer (ANDO AQ-6315A). 

Figure 1 shows both measured (the open circles) and calculated (the solid line) 
transmission spectra for the perforated gold film (inset is the focused-ion-beam image 
of the square holes), which is characterized by the transmission dips and peaks. In the 
analytical calculation (see the following), the refractive index for air and glass is set 
as 1 and 1.46 respectively, and a frequency-dependent permittivity for gold is used 
[15]. One can see that the experimental results, including the spectrum shape, the 
transmission minima and maxima are well reproduced by the calculations. In the 
experimental transmission spectrum, two dominant dips locate at the wavelengths 606 
and 870nm, which is very close to the calculated 598 and 870nm (a small dip at 

658nm is due to reciprocal vector 

1,1G  which is neglected in the theory). And the 

transmission efficiency is greatly enhanced with the peaks positioned at 710 and 

 

2

·
945nm, which agrees respectively with the theoretical values 694 and 946nm. 
Moreover, good agreement can also be extended to the width of transmission peaks 
(or dips), as can be seen from the spectra. So far, the numerical calculation based on 
the Fourier modal method has been found in the literature to be most successful [11], 
nevertheless the deviation of peak position (and peak width) between theory and 
experiment is still up to about 80nm (and 40%). Comparing with previous work, our 
analytical results appear to be more preferable. In addition, the locations of Wood
anomaly and SPP resonance have been marked in the transmission spectra by the 
thinner and thicker arrows, respectively. It is found for the first time that the Wood ’s 
anomaly corresponds not to the transmission minimum but to a small step located 
near the transmission dip, where the detail is exhibited in both measured and 
calculated spectra. Overall, the calculation captures quantitatively the transmission 
properties and thus reveals the underlying physics of the light transmission. 

’s 

It is a common knowledge that diffraction modes can be generated when the 
incident light impinges on the structured metal surface. These diffraction modes will 
be of great importance in the light transmission as stressed by the CDEW model [14]. 
In addition, for the metal film, the surface charges can be excited and couple strongly 
to the electromagnetic fields. These surface plasmons, being of either positive or 
negative effect, will participate in shaping and simultaneously be marked in the 
transmission spectrum. Actually, besides the SPP mode formed on the metal-dielectric 
interface, the surface plasmons also involve the light-electron interaction inside the 
nanoholes. In the transmission, the electromagnetic waves are strongly confined in the 
subwavelength holes, which act as the unique channel for the photon tunneling. Then, 
strong coupling between light and electrons on the hole walls can be induced, giving 
rise to cavity surface plasmons (CSP) in the nanoholes. 

By using Maxwell’s equations and surface-impedance boundary condition (SIBC) 

imposed on the subwavelength hole walls, the wave fields inside the holes can be 
approximated by (the surface normal is in the y direction)

(
of light to collective oscillation of electrons, can be termed as the CSP mode. In 

). This surface mode confined in the nanoholes, originating from coupling

addition, the y-component of wavevector 

0q  is also imaginary when the wavelength 

is much larger than the hole size. Comparing with the tunneling effect of electrons 
where the electron energy is lower than the potential and the wavevector of de Broglie 
wave is imaginary, here the photon tunneling effect in the nanoholes can be expected. 

However, due to the presence of CSP mode, 

0q  becomes smaller and thus the 

photons are easier to pass through the subwavelength holes than that in a 
perfect-metal case. This efficient channel has been proposed by Popov et al. [17], but 
the origin was not clarified. Now, it is clear that this CSP-assisted and enhanced 
photon tunneling effect will contribute actively to the transmission of light. 

The distribution of wave fields in the space has been deduced analytically, which 

is found to be strongly dependent on a resonance factor

Where

the metal-dielectric interface (the approximated SPP dispersion is caused by the SIBC 
imposed on the metal surface). Therefore, the SPP mode is responsible for the 
transmission dip (the SPP minima), which is identical to the experiment (see the 
thicker arrows in figure 1). 

We notice in a recent calculation that the dispersion of SPP on a perforated metal 

film has been proposed to be strongly modified [18]. There, the so-called dispersion 
curve obtained by searching for the poles of scattering matrix is linked not merely to 
the SPP mode [19]. Moreover, the change of dispersion by more than 10% [18] is 
difficult to understand, considering the fact that the SPP dispersion on slit arrays is 
within 1% of the flat case [14]. Here the theory and experiment show that when the 
resonance condition (equation (7)) is satisfied a sudden decrease in the transmission 
will be induced. The results strongly suggest that the SPP mode (the inherent surface 
resonance) of a flat metal surface still survives and acts on the perforated metal film, 
i.e., the residual metal surface. 

The negative role of SPP mode has been suggested in the subwavelength slits [13, 

20] and admitted by Ebbesen et al. [6]. This point hold even for two-dimensional 
holes is not difficult to understand. When the resonance condition is satisfied, some

evanescent diffraction mode will couple strongly to the SPP wave and others are 
suppressed, where the photons seem to be absorbed on the surface. Nevertheless, the 
SPP wave is limited to the metallic boundary (the hole opening is not favored) due to 
the coupling between light and electrons. Moreover, the electromagnetic fields of the 
SPP yield two flow of energy: one is strong and proceeds along the metal surface, 
while the other is weak and travels normal to the metal film. However, the former 
cannot supply the energy flow for the transmission; and the latter can work only when 
the metal film is very thin [4, 5], which is not hold here. Hence, the SPP mode 
contributes negatively to the transmission. 

An important result predicted by the theory is that the Wood ’s anomaly does not 

give rise to transmission minimum, which is contrary to the conventional idea [8]. 

Since 

mjee

, when

 (this is the condition for Wood

’s anomaly), 

the transmission is low as shown to be a step in figure 1. Physically, in the case of 
Wood’s anomaly the related diffraction order becomes tangent to the metal surface 
and unable to transmit. But the remaining diffraction modes have not been suppressed 
completely, which couple with the CSP mode and result in a weak transmittance. In 
fact, the position of Wood
’s anomaly is always slightly smaller than that of 
transmission dip. When the metal film is perfect conducting, they turn out to be 
’s anomaly is actually an approximation to the 
identical. Therefore, the Wood
transmission minimum. 

In addition, the analytical results show that the wave amplitudes in the nanoholes 

(

0A  and 

0B  in equation (1)) are proportional to 

( )F l . Thus the CSP mode is 

greatly suppressed when the SPP wave is resonantly excited. However, when the 
wavelength is far from the SPP resonance, a strong coupling between the evanescent 
diffraction modes and the CSP mode will be established. The evanescent diffraction 
modes can propagate along the whole surface, including the nonmetallic interface at 
the hole opening, where coupling occurs through the matching of the fields. Then the 
diffraction modes on the incident side will emit the photons that tunnel via the CSP 
mode to the other side, which further couples to the outgoing light. This coupling can 

be strongly resonant when 

( )F l  reaches its maximum. In general, the second term 

on the right-hand side of equation (3) is much smaller and can be neglected. Then the 

condition for resonance can be simplified to

corresponds to strong coupling of CSP mode to upper- or lower-side diffraction 
modes, respectively. Both cases can lead to great enhancement of CSP mode and 
evanescent diffraction modes on either side. Consequently, a strong power flow 
normal to the metal film is supported and the energy is transferred efficiently from 
one side to the other side, which differs significantly from the case when the SPP is 
resonantly excited. Therefore, the transmission enhancement is due to the coupling of 
diffraction modes to CSP mode (or CSP excitation) rather than coupling between SPP

modes on both sides of the metal film (or SPP excitation [10]). 

The optical transmission through a perfect metal film perforated with square 
holes has also been calculated (the thinner solid line in figure (2)), where the SPP and 
CSP modes are both absent. One can see that the transmission dips and peaks are still 
supported, implying that the surface plasmons are not necessary for transmission. 
However, the case is indeed different when they are present (the thicker solid line in 
figure (2)). On the one hand, the dip position is shifted from Wood ’s anomaly to SPP 
resonance (the SPP contribution). On the other hand, the position of peaks is red-shift 
and simultaneously the peak width is greatly enlarged (the CSP contribution). It is 
also found that when the metal film becomes thicker, the transmission efficiency for a 
real metal is much higher than that of a perfect one, which confirms that the CSP 
mode plays an active role in the transmission. 

Although the results presented here are based for convenience on square holes, 

the underlying physics is general. In the light transmission, the diffraction modes 
interact with the surface plasmons: strong coupling of diffraction modes to SPP results 
in the transmission minima and to CSP the transmission maxima. This dual-effect of 
surface plasmons is critical for the transmission properties. Certainly, these useful 
elements, including the diffraction modes, the SPP mode, and the CSP mode, provide 
us with more degrees of freedom for the applications, with which the near- and 
far-field optical properties can be manipulated and novel devices may be constructed.

Summary 

Non  linear  dynamic  behaviour  of  a  normally  excited  preloaded  Hertzian  contact  (including 

possible contact losses) is investigated using an experimental test rig. It consists on a double 

sphere  plane  contact  loaded  by  the  weight  of  a  rigid  moving  mass.  Contact  vibrations  are 

generated  by  a  external  Gaussian  white  noise  and  exhibit  vibroimpact  responses  when  the 

input  level  is  sufficiently  high.  Spectral  contents  and  statistics  of  the  stationary  transmitted 

normal force are analysed. A single-degree-of-freedom non linear oscillator including loss of 

contact  and  Hertzian  non  linearities  is  built  for  modelling  the  experimental  system. 

Theoretical  responses  are  obtained  by  using  the  stationary  Fokker-Planck  equation  and  also 

Monte Carlo simulations. When contact loss occurrence is very occasional, numerical results 

shown  a  very  good  agreement  with  experimental  ones.  When  vibroimpacts  occur,  results 

remain  in  reasonable  agreement  with  experimental  ones,  that  justify  the  modelling  and  the 

numerical methods described in this paper. 

The  contact  loss  non  linearity  appears  to  be  rather  strong  compared  to  the  Hertzian  non 

linearity. It actually induces a large broadening of the spectral contents of the response. This 

result is of great importance in noise generation for a lot of systems such as mechanisms using 

contacts to transform motions and forces (gears, ball-bearings, cam systems, to name a few). 

It is also of great importance for tribologists preoccupied to prevent surface dammage. 

 

1. Introduction 

Hertzian  contacts  exist  in  many  mechanical  systems  such  as  mechanisms  and  machines 

(gears, cam systems, rolling element bearings, …). Under operating conditions, these contacts 

are  often  excited  by  dynamic  normal  forces  superimposed  on  a  mean  static  load.  These 

excitation forces which are deterministic or random, can result from external sources, such as 

applied load fluctuations, or from internal ones, such as roughness-induced vibrations. Under 

excessive  excitation,  contacts  can  exhibit  undesirable  vibroimpact  responses,  allowed  by 

clearances  introduced  through  manufacturing  tolerances.  Resulting  dynamic  behaviour  is 

characterised  by  intermittent  loss  of  contact  and  shocks  leading  to  excessive  wear,  surface 

damage and excessive noise. 

In  a  companion  paper  (Part  I:  Harmonic  excitation)  [12],  the  dynamic  behaviour  of  a 

fundamental preloaded Hertzian contact subjected to harmonic normal forces was studied. To 

this end, an improved experimental test rig permitted us to investigate the primary resonance 

in detail, including vibroimpact responses. Theoretical results were also presented to conclude 

on the main characteristics of the primary resonance.  

In  the  present  second  part  of  this  work,  the  previous  analysis  is  extended  to  the  case  of 

vibroimpact  response  of  a  preloaded  and  non-sliding  dry  Hertzian  contact  under  Gaussian 

white  random  normal  excitation.  Comparisons  between  experimental  and  theoretical  results 

permit  us  to  conclude  on  some  characteristics  of  the  random  dynamic  responses,  including 

vibroimpact behaviours. 

As  the  literature  shows,  there  exist  a  few  number  of  papers  in  this  area.  These  include 

references  [1-7].  They  generally  concern  random  normal  vibrations  for  sliding  contacts 

related to the internal random roughness surface induced excitation. 

Experimental  results  can  be  found  for  example  in  references  [2-5;7].  In  these  studies, 

excitation random force applied to the contact is never exactly known because measurements 

are always performed during sliding conditions. It is estimated on the basis of assumptions on 

the  spatial  spectrum  of  the  surface  roughness  input.  Decrease  of  the  frequency  domain 

spectrum  shape  with  a  ω− 4

  law  is  generally  retained.  These  works  principally  focus  on  the 

interaction  between  normal  and  tangential  forces,  friction  force  vibrations  and  friction 

coefficient  behaviour  under  dynamic  conditions.  Further,  vibroimpact  behaviours  are  very 

partially analysed. 

In  a  theoretical  point  of  view,  Nayak  [1]  presents  a  detailed  analysis  of  a  Hertzian  contact 

excited  by  a  broadband  random  normal  force.  But,  intermittent  loss  of  contact  is  partially 

taken  into  account.  This  problem  is  examined  by  Hess  et  al.  [5]  who  consider  also  small 

values  of  probability  of  contact  loss.  The  used  theoretical  method  is  based  on  the  Fokker-

Planck  equation,  introducing  the  restoring  elastic  Hertzian  force  by  a  third  order  Taylor 

expansion.  The  procedure  is  refined  by  Pärssinen  in  a  recent  brief  paper  by  introducing  the 

real form of the theoretical restoring elastic Hertzian force [6]. 

2. Test rig and experimental procedure 

The  experimental  studied  system  is  similar  to  the  one  presented  in  part  I  of  this  work  [12]. 

Recall that it consists on a 25.4 mm diameter steel ball preloaded between two horizontal steel 

flat surfaces. The first one is rigidly fixed to a vertically moving cylinder, the second one is 

rigidly fixed to a heavy rigid frame. The double sphere-plane dry contact is loaded by a static 

normal load Fs = mg = 110 N which corresponds to the weight of the moving cylinder.  

Using a suspended vibration exciter, random normal force is applied to the moving cylinder 

and superimposed on the static load. For this end, a signal generator and a power amplifier are 

used to generate the white noise signal. This signal is filtered above 1 kHz which is up to 4 

times the experimental linearised contact frequency (f0 = 233.4 Hz). 

A  piezoelectric  force  transducer  is  mounted  between  the  vibration  exciter  and  the  moving 

cylinder to measure the excitation force. Normal force N(t) transmitted to the base through the 

contact is measured by a piezoelectric force transducer mounted between the lower plane and 

the  rigid  frame.  Considering  the  experimental  system  and  the  transducer  stiffness 

(8000 N/µm), the force measurement bandwidth is sufficiently wide (0-7 kHz). 

The  input  force  and  the  dynamic  response  are  displayed  on  a  storage  oscilloscope. 

Experimental  average  one-sided  RMS  magnitude  spectra  are  measured  with  a  real  time 

spectrum  analyser  using  a  sampling  rate  of  4096  samples  over  the  frequency  bandwidth  (0-

1 kHz) with a frequency resolution always less than 0.25 Hz. Average spectra were obtained 

with  a  number  of  spectrum  up  to  275.  Dynamic  responses  are  digitised  using  an  A/D 

converter  and  stored  for  statistical  post-treatments.  These  responses  are  sampled  for  a  20 s 

duration with sampling rate of 10000 samples per second. 

3. The theoretical dynamic model 

3.1 Equation of motion 

On the basis of identical assumptions that ones introduced in the first part of this work, the 

experimental  system is modelled by a randomly excited single-degree-of-freedom non-linear 

dynamic system shown in Figure 1 and described by the following motion equation:

(1) 

In  this  equation,  z  is  the  normal  displacement  of  the  rigid  mass  m  measured  such  as  z < 0 

corresponds  to  loss  of  contact.  Assuming  viscous  law,  c  is  a  damping  coefficient,  k  is  a 

constant given by the Hertzian theory, H is the Heaviside step function, W(t) is a stationary 

zero-mean  Gaussian  white  noise  and  h  controls  level  of  the  random  normal  force.  From 

equation  (1),  the  theoretical  static  contact  compression  zS  and  the  linearised  contact  natural 

circular frequency Ω are given by:

In this equation, overdot indicates differentiation with respect to the dimensionless time τ, ζ is

Finally, it should be noted from equation (9) that loss of contact corresponds to the inequality: 

 

q < − 3/2 

(15) 

To  investigate  theoretical  dynamic  responses,  we  have  used  several  numerical  methods  as 

3.2 Numerical methods 

follows: 

- 

a classical numerical time integration explicit scheme, i.e. the central difference scheme, 

for achieving dynamic time histories of responses, 

- 

the  stationary  Fokker-Planck  equation  applied  to  system  (6)  under  Gaussian  white-noise 

excitation for describing the statistics of the dynamic responses, 

- 

classical statistical tools to describe random vibrations, 

-  Monte Carlo simulations to estimate power spectral densities of responses of the randomly 

excited system. 

When necessary, these methods are described in the following. 

4. Experimental results 

4.1. Dynamics without loss of contact 

Figure 2  displays  the  experimental  average  one-sided  RMS  magnitude  spectra  of  the 

transmitted  normal force for various random input levels. These levels are chosen in  such a 

way  that  no  loss  of  contact  occurs  during  the  measure.  For  these  cases,  G0 = 1 10− 4

, 

G0 = 4.5 10− 3

 and G0 = 30 10− 3

 N 2/Hz with corresponding values of h = 1 10− 6

, 4.5 10− 5

 and 

3 10− 4

 respectively. For the lowest input level, the spectrum exhibits  a single resonant peak 

close  to  the  linearised  contact  frequency  (233.4 Hz).  This  result  is  in  very  good  agreement 

with  the  predicted  one  (232 Hz).  In  this  case,  linear  behaviour  can  be  assumed  and  an 

equivalent viscous damping ratio can be estimated from the half power frequency bandwidth 

method.  Experimental  curve  leads  to  ζ  less  than 0.5 % .  This  result  is  coherent  with  the 

previous value found in the part I of this work [12]. 

When  the  input  level  increases,  dynamic  behaviour  becomes  weakly  non-linear.  Actually,  a 

second peak close to the second harmonic of the linearised contact frequency arises. For the 

highest  input  level  shown  in  Figure 2,  the  second  peak  value  reaches  8 %  of  the  main  peak 

value.  Furthermore,  increasing  the  input  level,  we  observe  a  weak  broadening  of  the  two 

peaks. We also observe weak decrease of the two peak frequencies. 

Experimental normal force probability density functions corresponding to the three preceding 

input levels are presented in Figure 3. The associated mean, standard deviation, and skewness 

values are given in Table 1. The normal force shows a nearly zero probability of intermittent 

contact  loss  (which  corresponds  to  N<-1).  Further,  increasing  the  input  level,  the  Gaussian-

like shape of the probability density function moves to a more and more asymmetrical shape. 

This  is  confirmed  by  the  evolution  of  the  skewness  value  given  in  Table 1.  However,  the 

deviation from a Gaussian process is weak. Considering the mean value of the normal force, it 

remains also very close to the applied static load. Further, the standard deviation reaches 40 % 

of the static normal force. 

Figure 4 displays an example of the time history of the normal force for an input level such 

that  intermittent  contact  loss  does  not  occur  during  acquisition  data.  In  agreement  with  the 

spectral  responses  content,  this  trace  is  typical  of  a  narrow-frequency-band  random  noise 

response. A slight asymmetrical response can be observed revealing the asymmetrical law of 

the restoring Hertzian elastic force around the static load. 

4.2. Dynamics with intermittent loss of contact  

When  the  random  input  level  increases,  intermittent  contact  loss  may  occur  as  the  normal 

force  can  reach  the  static  load.  Figure 5  shows  the  experimental  average  one-sided  RMS 

magnitude spectra for increasing random input levels, chosen in such a way that intermittent 

loss  of  contact  occurs  during  the  measure.  For  these  cases,  G0 = 6 10− 2

,  G0 = 1.7 10− 1

  and 

G0 = 2.5 10− 1

  N 2/Hz  with  corresponding  values  of  h = 6 10− 4

,  1.7 10− 3

  and  2.5 10− 3

 

respectively. The broadening of the resonant peaks is clearly observed. It is known that it is an 

essential property of spectrum shapes with large non-linearity and low damping [9]. One can 

also  observe  the  rising  of  a  broad  third  peak.  Furthermore,  resonant  peaks  shift  to  lower 

frequencies, particularly the second and the third ones. This can be explained by the more and 

more  asymmetrical  shape  of  the  time  trace  of  the  transmitted  force  induced  by  the  flight 

response of the cylinder. Hence, as expected, loss of contact non-linearity is stronger than the 

Hertzian contact one. 

Figure 6 displays the corresponding experimental normal force probability density functions. 

The  associated  mean  value,  standard  deviation  and  skewness  values  are  given  in  Table 2. 

Probability density functions are strongly asymmetrical and so deviate hardly from a Gaussian 

process.  This  is  confirmed  by  Skewness  values  given  in  Table 2.  Asymmetrical  behaviour 

corresponds to the appearance of a peak at the zero transmitted normal force in the probability 

density  functions  (N=-1).  In  particular,  the  longer  flight  time  of  the  cylinder,  the  higher  the 

peak  is.  Calculation  of  the  peak  area  allows  estimation  of  the  total  loss  of  contact  duration 

(this  has  been  also  estimated  by  treating  time  histories  with  coherent  results).  Results  are 

reported  in  Table 3.  For  the  highest  input  level,  intermittent  contact  loss  occurs  during 

approximately 15 % of the overall time. 

Figure 7 displays an example of the time history of the normal force for an input level such 

that intermittent contact loss occurs. From time traces, we measure the total number of contact 

losses  during  the  acquisition  time  (20 s).  We  estimate  also  the  mean  period  of  the  cylinder 

flight.  Results  are  presented  in  Table 3.  For  the  highest  input  level,  this  mean  period  is 

approximately equal to 1.5 ms and the number of impacts becomes large (around 2200 during 

a observation time of 20 s). 

5. Theoretical results 

5.1. The stationary Fokker-Planck equation 

Assuming stationary Gaussian white noise excitation, statistics of the stationary response can 

be obtained using the Fokker-Planck equation [1,5,6,10]. To this end, consider the following 

second order non linear differential equation of motion, in the general form:

(16) 

where  f(τ)  is  a  zero  mean  stationary  Gaussian  white  noise  excitation  with  intercorrelation 

function Rff (τ) = 2π h δ(τ), i.e. a power spectral density Sff (ϖ) = h. G(q) represents the non 

linear restoring force including the non-linearity related to contact loss. The forward Fokker-

Planck equation which governs the transitional probability density function

5.2. Monte Carlo simulations 

We  have  performed  Monte  Carlo  simulations  to  estimate  response  spectral  densities  of  the 

randomly  excited  system.  For  this  end,  we  have  used  an  explicit  numerical  time  integration 

scheme  (central  difference  method)  for  solving  the  motion  equation  (9)  and  for  achieving 

  

 

 

(31) 

(32) 

(33) 

dynamic  time  histories  of  the  normal  force.  Spectra  were  obtained  via  a  Fast  Fourier 

Transform procedure with a number of samples equal to 2048. Average spectra were obtained 

with a number of spectrum up to 400. To simulate the Gaussian white noise external force, we 

have considered a sufficiently wide band limited pseudo-random signal given by:

Frequencies ϖk are independent and uniformly distributed in ]0,ϖmax] and WM is a coefficient

where  r1  and  r2  are  two  random  numbers  uniformly  distributed  over  [0,1],  the  signal  is 

normally distributed. 

Also, Monte Carlo simulations have been used to obtain statistics of the stationary responses 

treating the theoretical time histories. Statistical moments have been estimated over 105 times 

the period of the linearised system with up to 250 samples by period. 

5.3. Theoretical results 

5.3.1 Statistics of the stationary response 

The  probability  densities  of  the  elastic  restoring  force  are  shown  in  Figure 8  (h = 3 10− 6

, 

8 10− 5

,  5 10− 4

)  and  Figure 9  (h = 1.2 10− 3

,  2 10− 3

,  3.2 10− 3

)  for  increasing  input  levels  and 

for  a  damping  ratio  equal  to  0.5%.  The  two  figures  correspond  respectively  to  input  levels 

chosen  in  such  a  way  that  no  loss  and loss of contact occurs. Both results derived from the 

Fokker-Planck equation and the Monte Carlo simulations are shown. As we can see, a good 

agreement between the two methods is observed. Small differences observed on Figure 9 can 

result  from  numerical  errors  associated  to  the  estimation  of  the  Dirac  value  at  N=−1.  By 

comparing  Figure 8  and  Figure 3,  we  conclude  on  a  good  agreement  between  experimental 

and  numerical  results.  Actually,  the  introduced  input  levels  leading  to  the  same  probability 

density  function  shapes  are  not  exactly  the  same  but  appear  to  be  of  the  same  order. 

Moreover, it should be stated that the pertinent variable is the ratio between damping ratio and 

input level (see equation 21). Further, damping law as well as damping value are not exactly 

known particularly when the amplitude response grows. So, in our opinion, adjusting damping 

ratio gives no more satisfaction than adjusting input level. However, one can assume that the 

experimental  damping  ratio  of  0.5 %  is  overestimated.  Actually,  by  taking  into  account  the 

average ratio between the two series of input levels, we conclude that a damping ratio equal to 

0.3 % is more convenient. By comparing Figure 9 and Figure 6, we conclude on a satisfactory 

agreement  between  experimental  and  numerical  results  when  intermittent  contact  losses 

occur.  Of  course,  the  theoretical  infinite  value  and  Dirac  function  at  N = −1   cannot  be 

observed in the experimental case. Further, ball motion between the two planes associated to 

the  second  mode  and  clearly  experimentally  observed  (see  Figure 7)  is  a  source  of 

discrepancy  between  theoretical  and  experimental  probability  density  functions.  Numerical 

statistics  obtained  from  equation  (25)  are  given  in  Table 4.  Statistical  results  obtained  from 

Monte Carlo simulations are reported in Table 5. Concerning standard deviations, satisfactory 

agreement  is  obtained  between  measured  and  computed  results  (see  Tables 1  and  2).  In 

accordance  with  the  preceding  remarks,  we  have  found  that  this  agreement  becomes  very 

good  if  we  scale  the  input  level  by  damping  ratio  with  a  value  equal  to  0.3 % .  So,  we  can 

conclude  that  the  numerical  tools  used  in  this  study  are  suitable  for  describing  standard 

deviations,  even  if  the  probability  density  function  are  not  exactly  the  same  when  contact 

losses  occur.  Concerning  mean  values,  discrepancy  between  experimental  results  and 

numerical  ones  is  found.  However,  it  should be pointed out that the  numerical mean values 

remain very close to the static applied load which is coherent with experimental data. Further, 

samplings of both experimental time traces and those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations 

are perhaps not sufficient to ensure precise estimate of the mean value. Concerning skewness 

values,  good  agreement  between  experimental  and  Monte  Carlo  simulations  results  is 

obtained, but discrepancies appear with results obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation. We 

don’t have  precise explanation, but we can assume that sampling procedure leads numerical 

errors  for  estimating  skewness  values.  Finally,  probabilities  of  contact loss  given  in Table 4 

have  been  computed  from  equation  (23).  Again,  very  good  agreement  with  experimental 

results is observed (compare the total loss of contact duration given in Table 3).  

5.3.2 Response spectra 

Figures 10  and  11  display  the  numerical  average  one-sided  RMS  magnitude  spectra  for 

increasing input levels (h = 3 10− 6

, 8 10− 5

, 5 10− 4

, 1.2 10− 3

, 2 10− 3

, 3.2 10− 3

). Comparisons 

with  Figures 2  and  5  reveals  a  very  good  agreement  between  experimental  and  numerical 

results  when  intermittent  contact  losses  do  not  occur.  The  agreement  remains  satisfactorily 

when contact losses occur, even if experimental level of the second and third peaks are higher 

than those obtained from numerical simulations. 

Since  the  experimental  test  rig  does  not  permit  higher  input  levels,  it  can  be  interesting  to 

know the effect of increasing input level on the transmitted force response through numerical 

simulations.  Figure 12  displays  the  average  one-sided  RMS magnitude spectra  of the elastic 

restoring  force  for  input  levels  higher  than  the  preceding  ones.  The  result  is  a  large 

broadening  of  the  spectral  density  response,  in  such  a  way  that  preceding  peaks  completely 

disappear. 

5.3.3 Effect of the Hertzian contact law on response spectra  

Since linear restoring force law is introduced in a lot of modelling of practical systems, it is of 

interest to compare results between modellings which include the Hertzian contact law or not. 

For this end, we have consider a simplified model for describing the elastic restoring force as 

follows: 

 

=

+

1)q1(H).q1(N

 

+

−

(34) 

Figure 13  displays  the  numerical  average  one-sided  RMS  magnitude  spectra  for  three  input 

levels (h = 8 10− 5

, 2 10− 3

, 1.4 10− 2

) showing comparisons between results obtained from the 

two  models.  As  one  can  see,  identical  results  are  obtained  around  the  primary  peak.  In 

contrast, the simplified model is not suitable to describe the dynamic behaviour in the range 

of  higher  frequencies.  Depending  on  the  objective,  approximation  (34)  can  be  favourably 

introduced under cover of saving of numerical time consuming. 

6. Conclusion 

An experimental test rig consisting on a dry double sphere-plane Hertzian contact is modelled 

as  a  nonlinear  single-degree-of-freedom  system.  Nonlinear  normal  force  response  of  this 

randomly excited system is analysed through experimental and theoretical results. 

For very low input force amplitude, almost linear behaviour is observed, and the experimental 

linearised  contact  frequency  is  deduced  with  a  very good agreement with the  predicted  one. 

Equivalent  viscous  damping  ratio  is  less  than  0.5 %.  Increasing  the  input  amplitude  reveals 

the second harmonic spectral peak. Probability density functions of the response show a little 

deviation  from  a  Gaussian  process  resulting  from  the  Hertzian  non-linearity  as  long  as 

intermittent contact loss is very occasional. 

As the input level increases, the probability of intermittent loss of contact strongly increases. 

The probability density functions of the response become largely asymmetrical. Furthermore, 

we  observe  the  rising  of  the  third  harmonic  spectral  peak  and  the  broadening  of  spectral 

peaks. This last behaviour is known as an essential property of the power spectral density of 

systems  with  large  non-linearity  and  low  damping.  It  is  clearly  verified  in  our  experimental 

results. 

excitation. 

For  all  these  behaviours,  numerical  and  experimental  results  agree.  We  conclude  that  the 

associated theoretical model is sufficiently accurate, despite the fact that damping is modelled 

in  a  very  simple  way.  So,  compared  to  vibrations  under  harmonic  excitation,  precise 

knowledge  of  the  damping  law  during  vibroimpact  response  is  less  determining.  Also, 

stationary  Fokker-Planck  equation  and  Monte  Carlo  simulations  are  suitable  methods  for 

describing  the  dynamic  behaviour  of  the  impacting  Hertzian  contact  under  normal  random 

In future, further numerical and experimental works are planned to take into account the effect 

of a lubricating film and the effect of sliding surfaces.

Abstract 
The FN-II is a  small dense plasma focus (4.8 kJ at 36 kV), operated at the Universidad 
Nacional Autónoma de México. Substantial effort has been dedicated to the study of the 
anisotropy  in  the  neutron  and  hard  X-ray  radiation.  Concerning  the  former,  it  has  been 
observed that there is an anisotropic distribution superposed on a far larger isotropic one. 
These  clearly  separated  effects  can  be  interpreted  as  the  consequence  of  two  different 
neutron  emission  mechanisms.  The  angular  distribution  of  hard  X-rays  and  ions  is  also 
studied within the chamber with TLD and CR-39 detectors respectively. Two maxima are 
found around the axis of the device for X rays within the 20-200 keV range.

1. Introduction 
The  dense  plasma  focus  device  has  been  recognized  as  an  interesting  radiation  source,  and 
specially  as a plasma based neutron source (via  2H(2H,n)3He reactions), since its conception in 
the  early  days  of  fusion  research  (Mather  1971).  In  spite  of  the  difficulties  it  presents,  mostly 
regarding  the  poor  uniformity  of  the  radiation  yield  from  shot  to  shot,  it  has  prevailed, 
particularly  in  developing  countries,  due  to  the  simplicity  of  its  engineering,  its  low  cost,  as 
compared to other fusion research devices, and the wealth of its phenomena (Brzosco et al. 1997, 
Bernard et al. 1998). Up to date, it is arguably the most accessible source of fusion neutrons, and 
research is underway in order to produce small, high repetition rate devices for applications, not 
only  as  neutron  sources  (Moreno  et  al.  2002),  but  also  as  X-ray  sources  for  microelectronics 
lithography  (Lee  et  al.,  1998)  and  biomedical  studies  (Dubrovsky  et  al.,  1998).  However, 
evidence exists since the early days of plasma focus research that the origin of such neutrons is 
not necessarily thermonuclear (Bernstein and Hai 1970, Milanese and Pouzo 1978). Ever since, 
anisotropy of the neutron fluence was observed (Lee et al. 1972), and the actual mechanism of 
neutron production in plasma foci has remained a source of controversy.   
 

It  has  been  well  established  that  an  energetic  ion  beam  is  produced  in  the  forward 
direction (Jäger and Herold, 1987, Rhee et al. 1988, Moo et al., 1991, Kelly and Márquez, 1996), 
which originates the anisotropic neutron generation (Aliaga and Choi 1998, Castillo et al. 1997, 
2002).  Although  there  has  been  considerable  theoretical  work  on  the  study  of  the  acceleration 
mechanisms  for  such  ion  beams,  proper  diagnostics  that  can  discriminate  between  existing 
theories,  are  still  lacking.  The  dynamics  of  the  ions  is  rather  complex  during  the  compression 
phase,  and  the  rise  time  of  neutron  signals  is  faster  than  the  thermalisation  time.  Thus,  even  if 
one  surmises  that  thermalisation  might  be  achieved  within  the  time  scale  of  this  phase,  it  is 
reasonable  to  believe  that  different  neutron  generation  mechanisms  coexist,  yielding  both 
isotropic and anisotrpic components in the neutron emission (Castillo et al. 2000, 2002, 2003). 
On the other hand, many laboratories rely on the measurements of calibrated activation counters 
in order to estimate the total neutron yield, but if the neutron emission is anisotropic, their results 
can be affected by the position of such counters. Placing counters both head on and side on may 
help to get a better picture of the neutron emission, but as shown by Castillo et al. (2003), this is 
not enough. It was shown that there are both isotropic and anisotropic components of the neutron 
angular  distribution,  and  that  in  the  two  machines  studied  (the  FN-II  in  Mexico  City,  and  the 
PACO  in  Tandil,  Argentina),  the  anisotropic  component  is  smaller  than  the  isotropic  one.  The 
case of PACO is particularly interesting and instructive, because although its anisotropy is larger 
than  usual,  it  was  found  that  the  neutron  fluence  close  to  the  axis  is  so  narrow,  that  it  only 
accounts for a small fraction of the total neutron yield (£
 5%). Thus, it follows that the fact that 
the ratio of the neutron fluence on axis to the fluence at 90o is large, does not necessarily mean 
that the beam-target mechanism is responsible for most of the neutrons.  

 
Time resolved measurements of the evolution of the neutron emission for angles between 
0o and 90o from the axis, have been made by Aliaga-Rossel and Choi (1998) for a medium size 
device (DPF-78, 28 kJ, 60kV) and by Yap et al. (1997) in a small device (3.3 kJ, 15 kV). They 
have shown that the head-on neutron pulse lasts longer than the side-on pulse. Furthermore, they 
have  found  that,  when  a  doping  gas  is  added,  the  anisotropy  is  significantly  increased;  the 
neutron  pulse  decays  faster  at  larger  angles,  while  the  head-on  pulse  remains  essentially 
unchanged.  As  the  concentration  of  the  doping  gas  increases,  the  length  of  the  side-on  pulse 
decreases, and a double structure in the neutron emission is revealed. If the Z of the doping gas is 

increased,  the  second  peak  disappears  from  the  side-on  signals.  This  suggests  the  existence  of 
two  different  neutron  generation  mechanisms,  which  can  be  selectively  affected  by  the  doping 
level, as well as the Z of the doping gas. This might be related to earlier observations in larger 
devices, such as those at the Frascati  (1MJ) (Maisonnier et al., 1972) and Poseidon (780 kJ, 60 
kV)  (Herold  et  al.,  1985,  Jäger  and  Herold  1987),  devices.  In  both  of  them,  neutrons  were 
emitted in two distinct periods; the first one during the final phase of radial compression, and the 
second  one  during  the  expansion  of  the  plasma  column.  However,  it  is  not  clear,  so  far,  if  the 
mechanisms  responsible  for  the  two  neutron  pulses  in  small  devices  are  the  same  as  those 
involved in large ones, since in the latter the size of the second pulse is clearly distinguished and 
larger  than  the  first  one.  In  contrast,  the  second  pulse  in  medium  and  small  size  devices  is 
smaller than the first one, and practically masked by it.  

 
Although  they  fail  to  give  information  on  the  plasma  dynamics,  time  integrated 
diagnostics are also useful, particularly when statistical information, such as the average X-ray or 
neutron yield, are needed. This would be the case when applications are in mind, where a sample 
is  subject  to  radiation  from  several  shots.  In  Castillo  et  al.  (2003)  we  measured  the  angular 
distribution  of    the  neutron  yield,  outside  the  vacuum  chamber,  1  m  away  from  the  plasma 
column, using plastic track detectors, between –170o and 170o. In this work we use the same kind 
of  detectors  in  order  to  obtain  angular  distributions  for  neutrons  and  protons  (resulting  from 
2H(2H,p)3H reactions), within the chamber, at a 13 cm. radius, using a semicircular holder. The 
hard X-ray angular distribution is measured using TLD-200 dosimeters. However, in this work 
we are physically constrained to measure the angular distribution within the –

 70o range. 

 
In section 2 we describe the experimental ser-up. The methods used to obtain the angular 
distributions  for  neutrons  and  protons  are  discussed  in  section    3,  and  the  measurement  of  the 
angular distribution of X-rays is shown in section 4. Section 5 is devoted to conclusions. 

2. Experimental set-up 
This work was performed using the FN-II small plasma focus device, operated at the Instituto de 
Ciencias Nucleares, UNAM (Castillo et al., 2002). It is a 5 kJ device at 37 kV, with an oxygen-
free copper anode, 40 mm long,  with a 50 mm diameter. The co-axial cathode is formed by ten 
copper rods arranged in a squirrel cage configuration at a radius of  50 mm. The insulator is an 
annular Pyrex® tube located at the base of the anode, matching its diameter. The energy storage 
is  provided  by  four  1.863  µF  capacitors  in  parallel,  and  the  discharge  is  triggered  by  a  simple 
mushroom electrode spark gap. Throughout the present work the plasma focus was operated in 
its neutron optimised regime, corresponding to a 2.75 torr deuterium gas pressure. In this regime 
a peak focus current of 350 kA and  an average neutron yield of  ~ 3 ·
 108 per shot are obtained. 
The  evolution  of  the  current  derivative  is  obtained  with  a  Rogowski  coil.  Two  silver  foil 
activation counters, one on axis, and the other at 90o, were used to measure the neutron yield. 

 
Neutron  and  proton  CR-39  detectors,  along  with 

thermoluminescent  TLD-200 
dosimeters, were placed on a 13 cm diameter semicircular holder inside the chamber around the 
central electrode of the plasma focus (Fig. 1.), as will be explained in next two sections.

neutron measurements. 

3. Angular distribution of protons and neutrons  
Plastic nuclear track detectors have played an important role in plasma focus research. They have 
been  used  in  diagnostics  of  the  axially  accelerated  ion  beam  (Sadowski  et  al.  1998,  2000, 
Skladnik-Sadowska  et  al.  1999,  2001),  as  films  of  Thompson  spectrometers  (Rhee  1985), 
including  a  time  resolved  version  (Rhee  1987  and  1988).  They  have  also  been  used  for  the 
detection  of  charged  reaction  products  (Al-Mashhadni  et  al.  1994,  Todorovick  1995),  and  in 
some  cases,  images  of  the  charged  particle  emission  sources  have  been  obtained  using  the 
camara  obscura  technique  (Jäger  et.  al  1985,  Jäger  and  Herold  1987,  Zakahulla  1999, 
Springham 2002). The way nuclear track detectors work can be summarised as follows. When a 
charged particle is slowed down in the detector, mainly by inelastic interactions with the plastic 
material, it leaves latent tracks of broken molecular bonds. These tracks can then be exposed, by 
attacking  the  plastic  with  some  chemical  agent,  such  as  NaOH  or  KOH.  Since  the  etch  rate  is 
larger over the track of broken bonds, a conical pit is produced, whose diameter depends, for a 
given etching time, on the charge and energy of the particle that produced it. Furthermore, the 
ellipticity of the pit give information about the angle of incidence of the charged particle. It can 
be easily observed with an optical microscope. Electrochemical etching can also be used, where 
the etched tracks filled with the conducting etchant act as needle electrodes (Brede 1999). In this 
case,  the  electric  field  is  amplified  at  the  tip  of  the  cone,  and  if  it  is  high  enough,  electric 

breakdown occurs, producing an enlargement of the track. However, we have only used chemical 
etching in our work.  
 

The  use  of  CR-39  (C12H16O7)  nuclear  track  detectors  for  proton  detection  is 
straightforward. Their use in neutron dosimetry was reviewed by Matihulla et al. (1990). Their 
use  as  a  diagnostic  for  neutrons  from  deuterium-deuterium  (D-D)  and  deuterium-tritium  (D-T) 
reactions  has  been studied by Collopy et al (1992), using an accelerator, and more recently by 
Frenje et al. (2002), using the OMEGA laser facility. In the case of D-D reactions, with which 
we  are  concerned,  2.45  MeV  neutrons  are  produced,  which  interact  with  the  detector  mainly 
through  elastic  (n,p)  scattering  of  protons  form  the  detector  material.  Radiator  foils,  such  as 
polyethylene,  can  be  placed  in  front  of  them,  in  order  to  increase  the  detection  efficiency.  At 
higher energies of the neutrons, even carbon and oxygen scattered nuclei can produce etchable 
tracks.  
 

 The proton detectors, with dimensions 1.8 x 0.9 cm2, 500 m m thick, were placed on the 
top side of the holder, covered with 100 µm Al filters, which are able let through the 2.8 MeV 
protons  from  the  fusion  reactions,  and  stop  other  charged  reaction  products,  such  as  1  MeV 
tritons and 0.8 MeV  3He. They should also be able to stop the lower energy deuterons that are 
accelerated in the discharge, away from the axis, and impurity ions which result from the erosion 
of the electrode. Indeed, they can still detect neutrons which result from n-p reactions within the 
detector.  For  this  reason,  the  analysis  is  made  over  the  top  surface  of  the  chips.  The  neutron 
detectors  are  placed  on  the  bottom  side  of  the  Teflon  holder,  which  is  1  cm.  thick.  Additional 
1mm. thick polycarbonate sheets were placed in front of the neutron detectors, for an enhanced 
n-p reaction rate. When in our earlier work, the neutron angular distribution was measured 1m 
away from the focus, outside the chamber (Castillo et al, 2003), we had the advantage of being 
able to treat the plasma column more as a point-like source, and measuring over a wider angular 
range,  but  at  the  cost  of  neutron  fluence,  and  consequently  a  larger  number  of  shots  were 
necessary.  On  the  other  hand,  charged  particle  diagnostics  can  only  be  possible  inside  the 
chamber.  The detectors were placed at 0o, – 15o, – 40o and  – 70o, and were exposed to 50 shots. 
 

After  exposure  the  nuclear  track  detectors  were  etched  by  the  standard  procedure,  in  
KOH    solution  at  controlled  temperature  (  60  ±  1  °C  ).  The  track  density  and  track  diameter 
distribution  were  measured  with  a  digital  image  analysis  system  (Gammage  and  Espinosa, 
1997).  The  proton  detector  placed  at  0o  deserves  special  attention,  since  it  shows  a  5mm. 
diameter blotch, where an extremely high density of tracks is observed. This is due to the high 
energy deuteron beam accelerated by the plasma column. However, outside this blotch, it is still 
possible to measure the track density. The number of tracks per cm2, counting only the circular 
ones, at each angle, is shown in Figure 2. These results were obtained with 12 hours of etching. 
Their average diameter is 3 ± 1 m m., which shows that suggests a mono-energetic distribution of 
a single kind of particles. The angular distribution for the detectors below the holder, showing 
roughly a  tenth of the  density as those above the holder, is shown in Figure 3. In this case 16 
hours of etching were necessary. In both cases the maximum is observed close to the axis, but 
slightly shifted in the positive direction.

tracks are included.

in this case. 
 
A  reasonable  doubt  can  be  cast  regarding  the  fact  that  the  detectors  on  top  of  the  holder  can 
detect  both  neutrons  and  protons.  For  this  reason,  it  is  necessary  to  obtain  the  neutron 
distribution simultaneously, in order to compensate this effect. A comparison between figures 2 

and 3 suggests that the tracks due to n-p reactions could at most be a tenth of those observed on 
top, since all other charged particles are stopped by the holder.  
 
4. X-ray angular distribution 
The  angular  distribution  of  X-  rays  can  be  obtained  by  means  of  thermoluminescent TLD-200 
dosimeters  (McKeever  et  al.  1995).  In  this  case,  radiation  produces  excited  states  within  the 
solid,  which  can  be  released  by  heating.  The  luminescent  response  is  proportional  to  the 
radiation received by the dosimeter, Their sensitivity depends on the material used. The TD-200 
is  made  of  CaF2:Dy,  and  is  sensitive  to  rays  within  the  20-200  keV  range,  with  a  pronounced 
peak at 30 keV. 
 

Like  the  proton  CR-39  detectors,  they  were  placed  on  top  of  the  holder,  covered  by 
aluminium  foil,  in  order  to  protect  them  from  the  plasma  discharge,  at    0o,  – 10o,  – 20o,  – 30o, 
– 40o, – 50o, – 60o, and – 70o. Figure 4 shows the resulting angular distribution, where statistics of 
10 batches of dosimeters have been accumulated.

thermoluminescent dosimeters. The two curves are possible fits to the experimental data. 
 
 
It is interesting to note that, opposed to the proton and neutron angular distributions, the 
X-ray  distribution  is  bi-modal,  peaked  at  – 20o.  This  apparently  happens  because  the  source  of 
this radiation is the electron beam that is accelerated towards the electrode. This is interesting for 
applications purposes, since it tells us that the axis is not the most illuminated position. 
 
 
 

 

5. Conclusions 
Angular distributions of protons, neutrons and X-rays, within the range of 20-200 keV have been 
obtained  for  the  small  FN-II  dense  plasma  focus  device,  within  the  discharge  chamber.  The 
neutron  distribution  shows  the  essentially  the  same  features  obtained  in  our  previous  work 
(Castillo  2003),  in  which  we  showed  that  the  neutron  fluence  is  composed  of  an  anisotropic 
contribution mounted on an isotropic one. The shape of the proton distribution is very similar to 
the  neutron  one.  This  simultaneous  measurement  is  necessary,  in  order  to  estimate  the 
compensation necessary in order to obtain the proton distribution. It is found in this work that 
the  neutrons  can  account  for  at  most  for  one  tenth  of  the  observed  density.  The  nature  of  the 
array unfortunately forbids the possibility of exploring the yield at angles beyond 90o. 
 
 
Although  the  well  collimated  deuteron  beam,  accelerated  by  the  plasma  column,  was 
clearly observed on the 0o detector on top of the holder, its study was beyond the scope of this 
work, so it was not further studied, but there is indeed a potentiality for the use of this kind of 
detectors  for  such  purpose.  This  has  indeed  been  explored  by  other  authors  in  the  past 
(Springham,2002). 
 
 
It was also found, by means of TLD-200 thermoluminescent dosimeters, that the X-rays, 
within  the  20-200  keV  range  show  a  bimodal  angular  distribution  peaked  at  – 20o;  a  natural 
consequence  of  he  fact  that  they  are  produced  by  the  collimated  electron  beam  which  is 
accelerated along the axis towards the electrode.

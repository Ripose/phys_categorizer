Abstract 

The  void,  which  is  a  dust-free  region  inside  the  dust  cloud  in  the  plasma,  results  from  a 
balance of the electrostatic force and the ion drag force on a dust particulate. The ion drag 
force having numerous forms, some of  which are based on models whereas others are driven 
from  first  principles.  To  explain  the  generation  of  voids,  Avinash  et  al.  proposed  a  time-
dependent nonlinear model that describes the void  as a result of an instability. We augment 
this model by incorporating the grain drift and by replacing the ion-drag force by that derived 
by Khrapak et al., in a spherical configuration. It has been revealed that the void formation is 
a threshold phenomenon, i.e., it depends on the grain size. Furthermore, the void possesses a 
sharp  boundary  beyond  which  the  dust  density  goes  down  and  may  present  a  corrugated 
aspect. For big size grains, the use of both ion drag forces leads to voids of a same dimension, 
though for grains of small sizes the Avinash force drives voids of a higher dimension. 
 

 

§.I. Introduction 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Dusty  plasmas  are plasmas  containing  micron  or  submicron  dust  grains that 

have very high charge and mass. These plasmas may be encountered in a wide range 

of situations spanning from astrophysical to industrial situations [1]. The charged dust 

grains exhibit  necessarily a collective behavior due to their charges  [2].  Indeed  new 

modes have been predicted and proved  to exist by way of numerous experiments  [3]. 

In  addition  to the dust grain  dynamics,  the  charge  fluctuations  have  been  shown  to 

affect  the  existing  modes  supported  by  the  plasma.  Recently,  the  grain  mass 

fluctuations  caused  by  the  grain  sputtering  by  the  plasma  ions  have  been  proved  to 

influence the dielectric properties of the plasma as well  [4]. Generally, this influence 

of dust grains on the plasma may be considered spurious   in many cases suc h as the 

semi-conductor  manufacturing,  as  it  leads  to  material  yield  loss.  A  method  has  been 

proposed  to  push  away  dust  grains  from  the  center  of  the  plasma,  by  using  a 

ponderomotive force generated by an appropriate wave [5]. In this case, the grain size 

should  be  small  enough  as  a  big  grain  would  have  a  gyro-radius  greater  than  the 

experimental  set-up dimension. However, in many applications dust particles may be 

highly  desirable  such  as  special  material  processing,  e.g,  nanocristalline  powders  of 

pure metals  [6].  In  addition  to  the  modification  of  the  wave  spectra,  the  grains  in  a 

plasma  exhibit  a  spectacular phenomenon  that  has been discovered the  last decade, 

namely,  the  dust  void.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  it  has  been  reported  by  Praburam  and 

Goree  [7],  that  when  particulates  grow  to  a  critical  size,  a  cloud  is  formed  in  the 

interelectrode  zone.  Later  on,  the  cloud  undergoes  a  transition  to  a  turbulent  state, 

where a  very  low-frequency  filamentary  mode  is  excited. After this mode developed, 

another mode  coined by the authors “great void” appeared. It is a rotating region free 

from  dust  grains.  It  has  been  stated  that  the  shape  of  the  void  is  determined  by  the 

combined  effect  of  the  electric  force  and  the  ion  drag  force  that  expresses  the 

momentum  transfer  from  collisions  of  flowing  ions  with  the  grain.  Later, Samsonov 

and  Goree  [8]  conducted  more  sophisticated  experiments  to  support  the  previous 

conclusion. Indeed, according to the authors, when the grain reaches the critical value 

the ion drag force overcomes the electric force and the  grains are moved outwardly. 

Hence, the electrons undergo less depletion, so  ionization is enhanced (and so  is the 

glow). It appears then, that the void is characterized by a critical size of the dust grain 

and a sharp boundary.  It should be noted that in the same time, experiments on voids 

have been conducted  also by Melzer et al. [9]. Nevertheless, the lack of  a  non- linear 

theory  that  exp lains  the  critical  size  of  the  grain,  the  sharp  boundary  of  the  void  as 

well as  its size remained.  To this end, Goree et al. [10] developed a one-dimensional 

non- linear fluid model to explain the  formation of the  void and its properties, where 

dust charging, ion drag force on dust, and a source of  ionization have been taken into 

account. It has been found that a void represents a stable equilibrium in a plasma with 

a sharp boundary where an ionization source is a necessary condition. Unfortunately, 

and  according to Avinash  et  al.[11],  though  the  proposed  interpretation  of  the  void 

formation  has  been  confirmed  by  numerous  experiments,  non- linear  time-dependent 

models that cope with the spontaneous development of the linear instability and the 

appearance  of  the  void  in  the  final  stage,  are  still  lacking.  Hence  they  proposed  a 

time-dependent self- consistent  non- linear  model  for  void  formation,  which is a one-

dimensional model that incorporates grain diffusion, collisions with neutrals, and an 

approximate  expression  of  the  non- linear  ion  drag  force (ABH force). In this paper, 

we augment the work of Avinash  et al. by  including three elements, viz., i/ the grain 

drift, ii/ a more accurate ion drag force, we use in particular the expression derived by 

Khrapak  et  al.  (  KIMT  force)  [12],  and  iii/  we  consider  the  void  formation  in  a 

spherical  configuration  (dependence  on  r),  in  which  case,  the  three  dimensional 

picture  may be achieved by  allowing  rotational  symmetry that  is  not  allowed  for  a 

one-dimensional  solution  (dependence on  x ).  The  paper  is  organized  as  follows,  in 

Sec. I we introduce the  subject; the formulation of the problem being exposed in Sec. 

II, whereas in  Sec. III the results are discussed. Sec.  IV is devoted to the concluding 

remarks.

§.II. Formulation 

              Let  us  consider  an  electron- ion  plasma  containing  a  cloud  of  dust  grains.                

The evolution of this system is described by the continuity and momentum equations, 

which are coupled to Poisson’s equation. The dust continuity equation is written as,

different values of the grain radius are considered for two different expressions of the 

ion  drag  force,  viz,  the  ABH  and  the  KIMT  expressions.  In  a  spherical  coordinate 

system, the three dimensional plot of the dust density may be obtained by way of a 

rotation  around  the  axis  of  symmetry,  which  is  not possible with  a  one-dimensional  
0=x

solution  as  it  is    not  symmetric  around 

.  It appears through the  figures  that a 

dust  void  with  a  sharp  boundary  exists  provided  the  grain  radius  exceeds  a  critical 

value,  which  is  different  for  different  expressions  of  the  ion  drag  force.  The 

dimension of the void decreases with an increasing grain radius. However, for small

values  of  the  grain  size  and  when  the  ABH  form  of  the  ion  drag  force  is  used, the 

tendency  of  the  void  dimension  is  towards  the  increase  for  increasing  grain  radius. 

Moreover,  the  dimension  of  the  void  seems  to  reach  an  asymptotic  value  when  the 

grain radius is increased. The  use of different expressions of the ion drag force shows 

that the  ABH  force  generates  a  bigger  void  than  the  one  generated  by  the  KIMT 

force. For higher grain sizes, no significant difference between the voids generated by 

the  ABH  and  KIMT  forces  is  seen.  In  other  words,  for  big  grains,  the  expression 

derived by Avinash  et al.  leads to acceptable results. Furthermore, in  all  figures,  we 

notice a density build up at the void boundary (a density  peak) which is in agreement 

with the experiment.  Besides,  in  some  situations  it  is  noticed  a  density  corrugation 

beyond the void, which is in agreement with the experiment also. These are alternate 

zones of rarefaction and bunching of dust grains.

§. IV. Conclusion 

The  charged  dust  grains  in  a  complex  plasma,  exhibit  a  collective  behavior  due  to 

their  charge,  so  new  modes  are  excited.  Besides,  due  to  their  nature  the  grains 

rearrange  themselves  under  certain  conditions  in  the  plasma.  Indeed,  when  the 

particulates grow to a certain size, a cloud is formed that undergoes a transition to a 

turbulent  state  to  lead  to  a  void  of  dust,  i.e.,  a  dust  free  zone  determined  by  the 

balance of the electric and the ion drag forces. The void is characterized by a  critical 

size  of  the  grain  and  a  sharp  boundary.  In  order  to  explain  the  spontaneous 

development of the linear instability and the appearance of the void in the final stage, 

Avinash et al. proposed a self-consistent non-linear one-dimensional model that takes 

into account grain diffusion and collision with the neutrals,  and  where the non- linear 

ion  drag  force  has  been  modeled  by  an  appropriate  expression.  In  this  paper,  we 

augmented this model by incorporating the grain drift under the action of the electric 

field  along  with  an  accurate  ion  drag  force  derived  by  Khrapak  et  al.  from  first 

principles.  The  analysis  has  been  conducted  in  a  spherical  configuration.  The 

numerical  integration  of  the  differential  equations  revealed  the  following  aspects:  a 

void  with sharp boundaries indeed exists, provided the grain radius exceeds a critical 

value. The dimension of the void is found grain size dependent, though it reaches a 

stable value for increasing grain size. It has been shown also, that the void generated 

by  the ABH force is bigger than the one excited by the more accurate expression of 

the  ion  drag  force,  viz.,  KIMT  force.  For  higher  values  of  the  grain  size,  both 

expressions  of  the  ion  drag  force  lead  to  voids  of  comparable  dimensions. 

Furthermore, as  shown by experiments, the void boundary is a density peak beyond 

which the density falls down abruptly and may presents farther, a corrugated profile.

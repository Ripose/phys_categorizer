Abstract 

Formation  of  a  novel  hybrid-vector  spatial  plasmon-soliton  in  a  Kerr  slab 

embedded  in-between  metal  plates  is  predicted  and  analyzed  with  a  modified 

NLSE,  encompassing  the  hybrid  vector  field  characteristics.  The  soliton  self-

trapping in the lateral dimension is enhanced by the transverse plasmonic effect, 

yielding effective soliton dimensions of 100nm or less - representing the smallest 

reported optical soliton.

The  downscaling  of  conventional  photonic  circuitry  is  bounded  by  a  transverse  dimension  of 

~λ/2  (λ  is  the  medium  wavelength).  This  limitation  can  be  alleviated  by  the  incorporation  of 

metals,  giving  rise  to  surface  plasmon  polaritons  (SPP)  [1,2].  Here  we  analyze  a  novel 

configuration where light is transversely tightly guided between two metal layers, and laterally 

self  trapped  by  the  Kerr  effect.  The  plasmon  polariton  effect  enables  overcoming  the  λ/2 

confinement limitation in both transverse and lateral dimensions. Moreover, the implementation 

of  nonlinear  self-trapping,  rather  than  ordinary  waveguiding,  enables  all-optical  controlled 

interconnects, and relaxes the requirement for fabrication of in-plane nano-structures. The tight 

field confinement of our scheme is instrumental also for exhibiting such solitons with very small 

optical powers,  which is further  assisted by the  expected small group velocity of the plasmon-

soliton.  In this letter we present for the first time both an analysis of TM spatial solitons, using 

the Non-linear Schrödinger Equation (NLSE), where the full vectorial field is considered, as well 

as the prediction and characteristics of nano scale SPP based solitons. 

The underline mechanism for overcoming the regular diffraction limits when SPP waves are 

encountered is related to the fact that they are slow waves, namely their propagation momentum 

is larger than that of a plane wave propagating in the same dielectric. The specific setting of a 

dielectric  layer  enclosed  by  two  metal  layers,  supporting  SPP  mode,  is  thus  equivalent  to  a  2- 

dimensional subspace with reduced in-plan diffraction. The latter assists in exhibiting both linear 

[1]  and  nonlinear  photonics  with  lateral  light  field  dimensions  substantially  smaller  than  the 

wavelength. For the formation of "nano" – soliton – the reduced diffraction is instrumental also 

for  the  proper  transformation  from  Maxwell  equations  to  the  NLSE  of  the  envelope  function. 

Only  under  reduced  diffraction  conditions  –  this  transformation  can  take  place  at  such  small 

dimensions as detailed below.

The  plasmon-soliton  analysis  starts  by  deriving  a  novel  NLSE  for  TM  modes  nonlinearly  

laterally  confined,  taking  into  account  the  two  electric  field  components,  while  the  plasmonic 

effect  will  be  introduced  later  via  a  metal  cladding  structure.  An  NLSE  based  analysis  of  TM 

solitons  which  are  self  trapped  laterally  (in-plane)  by  the  Kerr  nonlinearity,  while  confined 

transversely  (vertical)  by  a  slab  waveguide  structure,  was  never  performed,  with  detailed 

consideration of the full vectorial nature of the field (to the best of our knowledge). This type of 

analysis is essential for the SPP based solitons which carry a substantial longitudal electric field. 

Experimental reports of transversal guided solitons in slab waveguides addressed TE polarization 

[e.g.  3].  As  for  theory,  most  of  the  analysis  was  focused  on  (1+1)D  solitons  with  nonlinearity 

that modifies the transverse guiding mode profile (or self sustained in a bulk nonlinear media), 

while  invariant  (infinite)  in  the  lateral  dimension  [e.g.  4-8].  Neither  included  the  full  vector 

nature of  the  guided soliton, although some incorporated waveguiding effects in the transverse 

dimension, using a variation method [9]. 

 In our structure - continuous waves are propagating in z direction, while being confined in 

the x direction (transverse) by slab waveguide layers and self-trapped by Kerr nonlinearity in y 

axis  (lateral).  For  vanishing  nonlinearity  the  structure  supports  TE  and  TM  mode  families, 

however, this distinction based on ∂y=0 is false when the nonlinearity sets in, resulting in self-

trapping  in  y  direction  and  the  coupling  of  the  TE/TM  modes.  Nevertheless,  TE/TM  based 

analysis  is  reasonable  when  the  soliton  width  (∆y)  is  significantly  larger  than  the  mode  width 

(∆x). (the x-axis field distribution enters the y-axis calculation as an effective parameter, similar 

to conventional prescriptions for temporal fiber solitons [10]).    

The wave equation obtained from Maxwell equations by introducing Kerr type nonlinearity 

[8] is:

electric field components become identical, which is instrumental for the integrity of the soliton 

(otherwise each field component will evolve differently), as well as for the ability to employ a 

single scalar NLSE aligned with the field. Weak nonlinearity is assumed, thus a negligible effect

which for non cross-directional susceptibilities yields ∂yEy=0 which manifests that solitons self 

trapped  in  the  y  direction  cannot  be  supported  by  a  TE  mode  while  guided  by  the  x  layered 

structure. 

We employ now the general results for TM modes to the gap SPP configuration, where a thin 

Kerr dielectric slab is sandwiched between two metal layers. This structure supports modes with 

cross-section much smaller than a wavelength. The modal field is effectively bounded to the gap 

in-between the metal layers, and can be reduced almost indefinitely with the thickness d without 

cutoff.  Moreover,  the  "plasmonic"  effect  enables  also  the  reduction  of  the  lateral  dimension  in 

the transparent waveguide core [1]. In Fig. 1 the effective index dependence on the wavelength 

and gap width (d) is depicted for the even and odd transverse modes. Higher effective indices, 

thus smaller lateral solitons, are exhibited for symmetric modes, with smaller d-gaps and as the 

wavelength is reduced towards the asymptotic SPP wavelength (λSPP= (1+n0

2)0.5 λplasma). 

For  a  non-plasmonic  configuration,  namely  regular  dielectrically  cladded  nonlinear  slab, 

applying  (7)  yields  a  minimum  of  the  effective  transverse  dimension  for  the  spatial  soliton 

5 

 

 

(Deff=(∆x ∆y)0.5) obtained for a slab thickness of ~ λ/2 (see Fig. 2). When trying to enhance this 

soliton  confinement  by  further  increasing  the  intensity,  the  paraxial  assumption  breaks  as  the 

accumulated  nonlinear  phase  becomes  comparable  to  that  of  propagation  -  such  that  formal 

solitons are not a self solution of the configuration. However, for the metal embedded nonlinear 

slab – as verified below - the "plasmonic" effect is harnessed to overcome this minimum soliton 

width restriction.  

Solving for a nonlinear dielectric sandwiched between two silver layers yields a closed form 

expression for the soliton width from (7). The effective mode size in a slab embedded in metal 

cladding  is  depicted  in  Fig.  2  (black)  and  compared  to  air  cladded  slab  case  (red).  The 

"plasmonic" signature is evident: in contrast to the dielectric clad case – having a minimum of 

Deff, in the plasmonic case - the effective size is reduced indefinitely with gap thickness and it is 

apparent  that  nano-scale  dimensions  below  the  diffraction  limit  (Deff<100nm)  are  achievable, 

(blue).  As  a  precaution  –  we  restrict  the  validity  of  our  model  to  regions  where  ∆y»∆x  (not 

satisfied in the dashed segments of the figure).  

To asses correctly the plasmon-soliton solutions, the following should be memorized: First – 

the typical propagation length for highly confined SPP waves is limited to the micro scale regime 

due to metal losses, and it is this typical propagation length we expect for the plasmon-soliton as 

well;  Second,  we  discuss  here  only  solutions  that  are  within  the  constrains  of  the  analytical 

model  –  namely  formal  hybrid  NLSE  plasmon-solitons,  however  other  and  not  less-interesting 

nonlinear  wavepackets  may  exist  under  the  conditions  set  by  the  plasmonic  effect  –  which 

require more complex modeling (e.g. for higher intensity, lower wavelengths, similar transverse 

and lateral dimensions, rapidly varying envelop etc.).   

6 

 

 

Cross-sections of the plasmon-soliton field intensity are depicted in Fig 3. A plasmon-soliton 

excited by an input wavelength of 820nm is shown in Fig 3(a), for η2=700KW/µm2 and d=40nm. 

The  plasmon-soliton  has  nano-scale  effective  width  of  ~100nm,  while  an  all-dielectric  slab-

soliton, for the same peak power, has a minimal effective width  which exceeds the diffraction 

limit  (Deff=370nm).  Further  more  –  the  latter  all  dielectric  soliton  exhibits  accumulation  of 

nonlinear phase comparable to the linear phase of the optical carrier, which severely limits the 

soliton notion here. For the plasmon-soliton the metal loses results in  a decay length of ~ 11µm, 

larger  than  the  soliton  length  of  ~2.7µm,  which  justifies  the  validity  of  using  the  notion  of 

soliton. Checking the validity of our approximations – reaffirms both the paraxial approximation, 

as the soliton length is much higher than the wavelength of the carrier wave (440nm), as well as 

the TM assumption - inplane dimension (∆y=250nm) is substantially larger than the vertical one 

(∆x=40nm).  We  should  note  that  even  when  both  dimensions  become  comparable,  the 

experience shows that TM analysis holds (e.g., see [1,2]).  

As the wavelength is increased, the losses are reduced. In Fig. 3(b) the intensity cross-section 

of  a  plasmon-soliton  is  depicted,  at  the  communications  wavelength  (1550nm).  A  sub- 

halfwavelength average width (~260nm) is obtained with decay length of 30µm.     

As  the  wavelength  is  reduced  towards  λSPP,  or  alternatively  increasing  the  gap  width,  the 

field is collapsing towards the interfaces, as elucidated in Fig 3(c) for gap width of d=200nm at 

wavelength of 820nm. Enhanced gap width results also in reduced losses; 26µm decay length for 

the  current  example.  Approaching  further  the  SPP  resonance  (frequency-wise)  or  increasing 

further the  gap width –  generates effectively  two coupled wavepackets  – each on a one metal 

surface,  which  represents  a  much  higher  degree  of  confinement  –  however  this  case  is  not 

faithfully described by the analytical soliton model. 

7 

We derived a hybrid vector NLSE describing slab confined TM modes which are self trapped 

in the free (in-plan) dimension by the Kerr effect. A nonlinear slab sandwiched between metal 

layers  supports  a  hybrid  "Plasmon-Soliton",  exhibiting  high  confinement  in  both  transverse 

dimensions  –  lower  than  the  conventional  diffraction  limit.  In  such  structures,  the  losses  will 

determine  the  useful  propagation  length  of  these  solitons.  A  reach  variety  of  additional  ultra-

confined nonlinear wavepackets, not conforming to the approximations used to derive the NLSE 

are yet to be explored.

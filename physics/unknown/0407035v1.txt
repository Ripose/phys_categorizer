Let a fully ionized plasma consist of electrons and ions. Concentration of these particles in  the plasma 
varies in the range n=ne+ni=1020-1025 sm-3, and the temperature 105-107  K. Hereinafter all numerical 
calculations concern to high-temperature, hydrogen, dense plasma, that is typical for the main sequence 
stars. Pressure of such a plasma is nearly 1011Bar. Under these conditions te nonideality and density 
parameters are close to one, for example, for the sun rs~0.4 and Г~0.1. Consequently, polarization and 
quantum-mechanical effects of diffraction and symmetry contribute significantly to such plasma 
properties. 

In the context of dielectric response theory one can find the interionic psevdopotential, which accounts 
for the local field correction and shielding effect [2]:

In contrast to the Coulomb and Debye – Hukel potentials pseudopotential (1) is restricted at the origin 
like the Deutsch potential. It is explained by the fact that this pseudopotential takes into account 
quantum-mechanical effects.    

 

At short interparticle distances and small values of the nonidelity parameter Г pseudopotential (1) goes 
close to the Deutsch potential and approaches the Debye – Huckel potential at large interparticle 
distances as both take into account electron shielding of ions.Such a situation changes at large Г values 
because of the local field correction.. 

With the help of the linear dielectric response theory one can find the structure factors

In the one component plasma the electron equation of motion with the electron-ion collisional friction,  
reads as

The first term in equation (3) is quasi-elastic force caused by the charge fluctuations, the second term is 
due to the friction; the last one is the external electromagnetic field.

On the basis of the figures one can canclude the following: 

1.  Range  of  frequencies  with  abnormal  dispersion  grows  when  the  nonideality  parameter 

increases. 

2.  The maximum of the absorption curve shifts to lower frequencies. 

3.  The  height  of  absorption  curve  peak  decreases  when  the  nonideality  parameter  grows,  and  

spectral width enlarges. 

Therefore the quantum-mechanical and nonideality effects play significant role at high plasma 
densities.

Behavioral and Brain Sciences Commentary on

To ward a Quantitative Description of Large-Scale Neo-Cortical Dynamic Function and EEG

by Paul Nunez

ABSTRACT: This  paper  focuses  on  how bottom-up  neocortical  models  can  be  developed
into eigenfunction expansions of probability distributions appropriate to describe short-term
memory in the context of scalp EEG. The mathematics of eigenfunctions are similar to the
top-down  eigenfunctions  developed  by  Nunez,  albeit 
they hav e different  physical
manifestations.  The bottom-up eigenfunctions are at the local mesocolumnar scale, whereas
the  top-down  eigenfunctions  are  at  the  global  regional  scale. However,  as described  in
several  joint  papers,  our  approaches  have  regions  of  substantial  overlap,  and  future  studies
may expand top-down eigenfunctions into the bottom-up eigenfunctions, yielding a model of
scalp EEG that is ultimately expressed in terms of columnar states of neocortical processing
of attention and short-term memory.

1.  INTRODUCTION

1.1.  Categorization of Experimental Spatial-Temporal EEG

Many reasonable  theoretical  studies  of  synaptic-like or neuron-like structures  have  attempted
experimental  conﬁrmation. However,  most  often  these  investigations  do  not  necessarily  address  the
“spatial-temporal” scales they purport to describe. Many inv estigators would like to see more work on
experimental design/tests of local-global interactions correlated to behavioral states at speciﬁc scales. For
example, if an EEG could reasonably be correlated to a resolution of 3−5 cm within a time scale of 1−3
msec, then experiments should be attempted to test if speciﬁc states of attentional information-processing
are highly correlated within this speciﬁc spatial-temporal range.

In this context, the work of Paul Nunez (PN) stresses resolution of EEG data within speciﬁc spatial-
temporal  scales,  giving  us  candidate  data  for  such  correlations. It  is  most  important  for  researchers  to
deal with the details of experimental evidence, not just pay homage to its existence.

1.2.  Theoretical Descriptions of Spatial-Temporal EEG

The theoretical framework given by PN encompasses global and local neuronal columnar activity,
giving  a  primary  role  to  global  activity. His  work  has  generated  interest  in  other  investigators  to  take
similar approaches to describing neocortical activity (Jirsa & Haken, 1996).

Other  investigators,  myself  included,  give  a  primary  role  to  local  activity, immersed  in  global
circuitry. In this context, PN brings to BBS commentary a sound framework in which to further analyze
the importance of considering multiple scales of neocortical activity.

1.3.  Generality of Eigenfunction Expansion

Here, I add my own emphasis this subject, to address how eigenfunction expansions of models of
brain function, similar to those performed by PN to describe how global models of wav e phenomenon can
be used effectively to describe EEG, can be applied to probability distributions of short-term memory ﬁts
to EEG data.

In the following description, emphasis is placed on overlap and collaboration with the work of PN,
especially  in  areas  wherein  local  and  global  interactions  are  required  to  detail  models  of  neocortical
interactions giving rise to EEG phenomena.

2.  SMNI Description of Short-Term Memory (STM)

Since  the  early  1980’s,  a  series  of  papers  on  the  statistical  mechanics  of  neocortical  interactions
(SMNI) has been developed to model columns and regions of neocortex, spanning mm to cm of tissue.
Most of these papers have dealt explicitly with calculating properties of short-term memory (STM) and
scalp  EEG  in  order  to  test  the  basic  formulation  of  this  approach  (Ingber, 1981;  Ingber, 1982;  Ingber,
1983;  Ingber, 1984;  Ingber, 1985a;  Ingber, 1985b;  Ingber, 1986;  Ingber  &  Nunez,  1990;  Ingber, 1991;
Ingber, 1992; Ingber, 1994; Ingber & Nunez, 1995; Ingber, 1995a; Ingber, 1995b; Ingber, 1996; Ingber,
1997;  Ingber, 1998).  This model  was  the  ﬁrst  physical  application  of  a  nonlinear  multivariate  calculus
developed by other mathematical physicists in the late 1970’s (Graham, 1977; Langouche et al, 1982).

2.1.  Statistical Aggregation

SMNI  studies  have  detailed  a  physics  of  short-term  memory  and  of  (short-ﬁber  contribution  to)
EEG  phenomena  (Ingber, 1984),  in  terms  of M G ﬁrings,  where G represents E or I, M E represents
contributions  to  columnar  ﬁring  from  excitatory  neurons,  and M I represents  contributions  to  columnar
ﬁring from inhibitory neurons. About 100 neurons comprise a minicolumn (twice that number in visual
cortex);  about  1000  minicolumns  comprise  a  macrocolumn. A mesocolumn  is  developed  by  SMNI  to
reﬂect the convergence of short-ranged (as well as long-ranged) interactions of macrocolumnar input on
minicolumnar  structures,  in  terms  of  synaptic  interactions  taking  place  among  neurons  (about  10,000
synapses per neuron). The SMNI papers give more details on this derivation.

In  this  SMNI  development,  a  Lagrangian  is  explicitly  deﬁned  from  a  derived probability
F G. A
distribution  of  mesocolumnar  ﬁrings  in  terms  of  the M G and  electric  potential  variables,
mechanical  string  model,  as  ﬁrst  discussed  by  PN  as  a  simple  analog  of  neocortical  dynamics  (Nunez,
1989; Nunez & Srinivasan, 1993), is derived explicitly for neocortical interactions using SMNI (Ingber &
Nunez, 1990). In addition to providing overlap with current EEG paradigms, this deﬁnes a probability
distribution  of  ﬁring  activity, which  can  be  used  to  further  investigate  the  existence  of  other  nonlinear
phenomena, e.g., bifurcations or chaotic behavior, in brain states.

2.2.  STM

The  SMNI  calculations  are  of  minicolumnar  interactions  among  hundreds  of  neurons,  within  a
macrocolumnar extent of hundreds of thousands of neurons. Such interactions take place on time scales
of  several t , where t is  on  the  order  of  10  msec  (of  the  order  of  time  constants  of  cortical  pyramidal
cells).  This also is the observed time scale of the dynamics of STM. SMNI hypothesizes that columnar
interactions within and/or between regions containing many millions of neurons are responsible for these
phenomena  at  time  scales  of  several  seconds. That  is,  the  nonlinear  evolution  at  ﬁner  temporal  scales
gives a base of support for the phenomena observed at the coarser temporal scales, e.g., by establishing
mesoscopic attractors at many macrocolumnar spatial locations to process patterns in larger regions.

3.  SMNI Description of EEG

3.1.  EEG Regional Circuitry of STM Local Firings

Previous calculations of EEG phenomena (Ingber, 1985a), show that the short-ﬁber contribution to
the a frequency and the movement of attention across the visual ﬁeld are consistent with the assumption
that the EEG physics is derived from an average over the ﬂuctuations of the system. I.e., this is described
by the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the variational principle possessed by LF
, which yields the
string model described above (Ingber, 1982; Ingber, 1983; Ingber, 1988).

3.2.  Individual EEG Data

The 1996 SMNI project used evoked potential (EP) EEG data from a multi-electrode array under a
variety of conditions, collected at several centers in the United States, sponsored by the National Institute
on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) project (Zhang et al, 1995).  The earlier SMNI 1991 study
used only averaged EP data.

After ﬁts were performed on a set of training data (Ingber, 1997), the parameters for each subject
were  used  to  generate  CMI  for  out-of-sample  testing  data  for  each  subject  (Ingber, 1998).  The results
illustrate  that  the  CMI  give  enhanced  patterns  to  exhibit  differences  between  the  alcoholic  and  control
groups of subjects.

4.  EEG Eigenfunctions of STM

4.1.  STM Eigenfunctions

The study ﬁtting individual EEG data to SMNI parameters within STM-speciﬁc tasks can now be
recast  into  eigenfunction  expansions  yielding  orthogonal  memory  traces  ﬁt  to  individual  EEG  patterns.
This development was described in the ﬁrst SMNI papers.

The  clearest  picture  that  illustrates  how this  eigenfunction  expansion  is  achieved is in (Ingber  &
Nunez,  1995)  wherein,  within  a  tenth  of  a  second,  there  are  stable  multiple  non-overlapping  Gaussian-
type peaks of an evolving probability distribution with the same STM constraints used in the NIH EEG
study above. These peaks can be simply modeled as a set of orthogonal Hermite polynomials.

4.2.  Expansion of Global EEG Eigenfunctions into Local STM Eigenfunctions

In  the  “classical”  limit  deﬁned  by  the  variational  Euler-Lagrange  equations  described  above, we
have demonstrated how the local SMNI theory reduces to a string model similar to the global model of
PN  (Ingber  &  Nunez,  1990). One  reasonable  approach  to  developing  the  EEG  eigenfunctions  in  the
approach  given by PN is to apply  the  variational  derivatives directly  to  the  SMNI  STM  Hermite
polynomials,  thereby  yielding  a  model  of  scalp  EEG  that  is  ultimately  expressed  in  terms  of  states  of
neocortical processing of attention and short-term memory.

5.  CONCLUSION

PN has been a key exponent of realistic modeling of realistic neocortex for many years, even when
it was not as popular as neural network modeling of “toy brains.” In the process of insisting on dealing
with  aspects  of  models  of  neocortical  systems  that  could  be  experimentally  veriﬁed/negated,  he  has
contributed to a rich approach to better understanding the nature of experimental EEG.

His  approach  has  led  him  to  stress  appreciation  of  neocortex as functioning  on  multiple  spatial-
temporal  scales,  and  he  has  collaborated  with  other  investigators  with  different  approaches  to  these
multiple scales of interactions. His approach has been to formulate a top-down global model appropriate
to the scale of scalp EEG phenomena, which includes some important local mesocolumnar features. This
approach has been sufﬁciently robust to overlap with and enhance the understanding of other bottom-up
approaches such as I have described, wherein mesocolumnar models appropriate to the scale of STM are
scaled up to global regions appropriate to EEG.

In this paper, I hav e focussed on how bottom-up SMNI models can be developed into eigenfunction
expansions  of  probability  distributions  appropriate  to  describe  STM  in  the  context  of  EEG. The
mathematics of eigenfunctions are similar to the top-down eigenfunctions developed by PN, albeit they
have  different  physical  manifestations. The  bottom-up  eigenfunctions  are  at  the  local  mesocolumnar
scale, whereas the top-down eigenfunctions are at the global regional scale. Future studies may expand
top-down  eigenfunctions  into  the  bottom-up  eigenfunctions,  yielding  a  model  of  scalp  EEG  that  is
ultimately  expressed  in  terms  of  columnar  states  of  neocortical  processing  of  attention  and  short-term
memory.

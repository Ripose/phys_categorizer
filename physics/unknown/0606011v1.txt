Abstract 
 
 We show how finance markets can be modeled empirically faithfully by 
using  scaling  solutions  for  Markov  processes.  Classes  of  exact  scaling 
solutions  are  presented.  We  then  show  that  our  generalization  of  the 
Black-Scholes partial differential equation (pde)  for nontrivial diffusion 
coefficients  is  equivalent  to  a  Martingale  in  the  risk  neutral  discounted 
stock  price.  Previously,  this  was  proven  for  the  case  of  the  Gaussian 
logarithmic returns model  by  Harrison and Kreps,  but we prove it for 
much  a  much  larger  class  of  returns  models  where  the  diffusion 
coefficient  depends  on  both  returns  x  and  time  t.  That  option  prices 
blow  up  if  fat  tails  in  logarithmic  returns  x  are  included  in  the  market 
explained.

1. Empirically Based Market Modeling 
 
In  order  to  produce  a  reliable  data  analysis  when  price  changes  are 
large, one should construct histograms from empirical data to obtain the 
density f(x,t) of logarithmic returns 
 

   

(1) 

 
rather  than  histograms  for  prices  p(t),    price  increments  δp,  or  small 
returns δp/p.  The quantity pc is a reference price that is defined in part 
3 below. The reason for choosing the variable x is that it’s both additive 
and units-free [1,2].  
 
Here’s how we constructed our empirically based finance market model. 
Starting with  long enough empirical time series x(t), we constructed the 
unmassaged  returns  histograms  which,  for  Δt>>1  sec.  we  were  able  to 
f(x,t),  where 
approximate 
f(x,t)=g(p,t)dp/dx=pg(p,t)  relates  the  returns  density  f  to  the  price 
density  g.  The  observed  returns  distribution  f  is  not  Gaussian  and 
instead is approximately exponential in x for small to moderate intraday 
returns 
the  underlying  market 
dynamics  then  essentially  means  discovering  the  time-dependence  of 
five parameters (a±,ν±,δ) in the exponential distribution [2,3].  
 
Taking to=0, we expect the variance of x to have the approximate scaling 
form 
 

f(x,t)=a±e-ν±(x-δ).  Discovering

where  H  is  Hurst’s  exponent.  For  a  stationary  process  (statistical 
equilibrium,  meaning  market  equilibrium)  σ2=constant  would  be 
required  [3,4,5],  but  financial  markets  yield  the  empirical  result 
H≈O(1/2),  so  that  real  markets  are  nonstationary/unstable:  there  is  no 
Invisible  Hand  to  produce  market  stability.  Traders,  unable  to  predict 
‘value’  pc  correctly  at  future  dates  [5],  are  uncertain  and  trade  often, 
creating  nonstationarity  and  volatility.  These  are  the  noise  traders,  the 
traders who provide the observed liquidity in normal markets [6]. 
 
Given  the  exponential  density,  we  then  used  variance  scaling    to 
discover that γ,ν ≈Δt -H, which combined with normalization yields

.

This density scales with tH, f(x,t)= t-H F(u) where u=x/ tH , and describes 
a Markov process, a process no autocorrelations (no memory) in x(t) [7]. 
 
The  efficient  market  hypothesis  (EMH)  describes  hypothetical  markets 
that  are  impossible  to  beat.  In  the  EMH  there  are  no  price  (-returns) 
patterns/correlations  that  can  be  exploited  systematically  for  profit  in 
any  possible  trading  strategy.  Real  markets  are  very  hard  to  beat,  are 
mainly  (nonGaussian)  noise,  and  so  obey  the  EMH  at  least  to  zeroth 
order.  A Markov process is a sufficient if not necessary condition for the 
EMH.  
 
Given the price sde 
 

, 

(4) 

 
where  µ  would  be  the  expected  interest  rate,  <p(t)>=p(0)eµt  with  no 
noise (with d(p,t)=0) and B(t) is the usual wiener process. Then using Ito 
calculus, the sde for x is 
 

    

(5) 

 
where  D(x,t)=d(p,t)  is  the  returns  diffusion  coefficient,  and  R(x,t)=µ-
D(x,t)/2 is the drift coefficient.  
 
The  exponential  model  given  above  assumes  that  R(x,t)=constant, 
otherwise  the  deduced  scaling  of  f(x,t)  is  cannot  be  exact  [7].  This 
approximation is discussed further in section 4 below. 
 
2. Markovian Scaling Dynamics 
 
To discover the underlying market dynamics, we next study the pde

  ! f(x,t)=A±t"He"x"#/tH  ! dp=µpdt+pd(p,t)dB(t)  ! dx=(µ"D(x,t)/2)dt+D(x,t)dB(t)  ! "f"t=#R"f"x+12"2"x2(Df) 
with R=constant [8]. Redefining x to mean x-Rt, we can study the drift-
free pde 
 

 

 

(7) 

 
and  then  replace  x  by  x-Rt  in  the  subsequent  solutions.  Let  H=1/2  for 
the time being.  If we set u=x/√t, then f(x,t)=F(u)/√t and D(x,t)=D(u) so 
that

Note  that  (9)  describes  the  scale  invariant  part  of  the  nonstationary 
market density f(x,t). Next, we exhitibt solutions for several illuminating 
cases.

where  α=  ε-2  .  The  limit  ε=0  yields  the  Osborne-Black-Scholes  Gaussian 
returns model, while ε=1 yields our exponential model (3) for H=1/2. 
 
Next, if 
 

   

(12) 

 
then we can generate fat tails

(13) 

 
in  a  nonstationary  process,  for  all  tail  exponents  2<µ<∞,  and  a  finite 
variance requires 3<µ<∞. The exact solution is  
 

 

 

(14) 

 
where  µ=2+1/ε.  This  result  describes  the  tails  of  the  observed  market 
density for all times t, where 2<µ<7 [9]. 
 
A  very  strong  and  direct  test  of  our  general  model  (9)  is  to  check  the 
data for the predicted scaling collapse t-1/2f(x,t)=F(u) where u=x/√t. This 
analysis  is  now  in  progress  [10],  where  also  we  compare  the  observed 
financial distribution with the one generated by the diffusion coefficient 
 

.  (15). 

 
This complete  analysis has been generalized to include the case where 
H≠1/2  [7].  For  a  Markov  process,  H≠1/2  does  not  imply  fractional 
Brownian  motion,  fBm  is  a  process  requiring  stationary  increments 
x(t+T)-x(t)=x(T)).  For  a  Markov  process  H≠1/2  simply 
implies 
nonstationary  increments  x(t+T)-x(t)≠x(T)  [7].  When  the  increments  are 
nonstationary then the required data analysis to test for scaling is quite 
tricky [10].  
 
To  test  for  fBm  means  looking  for  correlations  that  violate  the  EMH. 
There  one  must  check  the  data  very  carefully  for  two  independent 
conditions [7]: First, the increments must be stationary, x(t+T)-x(t)=x(T). 
Second,  with  the  mean  subtracted  from  x  so  that  <x>=0,  the  variance 
must  scale,  σ2=<x2(t)>=t2H.  Iff.  Both  of  these  conditions  satisfied,  then 
one  then  obtains  the  condition  for  arbitrarily  long  time  correlations 
(fBm),                       <(x(t+T)-x(t))2>=<x2(T)>=T2H. Most data analyses fail 
to observe that these two separate conditions must be satisfied to check 
for EMH-breaking scaling of the form of fBm.

For the general case of market densities scaling as f(x,t)= t-H F(u) where 
u=x/ tH , our predicted diffusion coefficient has the form [7] 
 

  (16) 

 
where both f(x,t) and D(x,t) have extrema at xc=lnpc/po=δ where pc=poeδ 
is  the  most  probable  price  at  a  later  time  t,  and  po  is  the  initial  most 
probable price at t=0. The price pc defines the ‘consensus price’ because 
it  is  the  most  widely  agreed  upon  price  of  the  financial  instrument  at 
time t [5]. This is our new non-neo classical definition of value. However, the 
peak δ≈RΔt of f(x,t) does not stand still, it can shift suddenly in a market 
crash  and  even  in  normal  intraday  or  interday  trading:  the  expected 
return  R  (better  said,  the  additive  constant  µ  in  R)  can  change 
discontinuously  with  sudden  changes  in  noise  traders’  sentiments.  In 
other  words,  “value”  is  very  strongly  time-dependent  notion  and 
depends  on  what  most  noise  traders  believe  about  a  financial 
instrument  at  any  given  time.  In  particular,  ‘value’  is  generally  not 
accurately  predictable  in  advance  (this  is  an  example  of  complexity 
[4,5]), we can only predict/know accurately what value was at different 
times  in  the  past.  This  means  that  notions  like  ‘overvalued’  and 
‘undervalued’  are  knowable  at  best  at  the  present  time  or  for  earlier 
times,  but  cannot  be  predicted  with  any  degree  of  confidence  for  the 
future. Most technical traders use past data (charts) to try to anticipate 
the future value, while some few exceptional traders like George  Soros 
also ignore the ‘market as noise’ and concentrate instead on something 
akin  to  technical  analysis,  based  on  qualitatively  guessing  the  future 
‘value’ of a financial instrument[11].  
 
Fischer  Black,  who  presented  a  clear  and  simple  analysis  of  option 
pricing  [12],  was  completely  wrong  with  his  speculation  about  market 
stability and equilibrium [6]: there is no tendency whatsoever for prices 
to ‘return to value’. Because market dynamics are unstable, price always 
diffuses away from ‘value’, there being no ‘springs’ in the market to pull 
prices back to value. In contrast, Soros [11] is right: financial markets are 
dynamically unstable.

It’s very easy to show [2,3] that the delta hedge strategy, when based on 
a nontrivial local volatility D(x,t), is still  instantaneously ‘risk free’, just 
as  in  the  case  of  the  Black-Scholes-Merton  model  based  on  Gaussian 
returns, where d(p,t) would then be a constant in the backward time pde 
 
 

. 

 

(17) 

  
 
For  real  markets,  in  contrast,  d(p,t)=D(x,t)  depends  strongly  on  both  x 
and t, the Gaussian model is never a good market approximation except 
very near to near the consensus value pc [3]. But for option pricing one 
cannot restrict to prices p(t) close to pc, we explain next exactly why one 
needs the correct market dynamics for a large range of prices.  
 
With the transformation u(x,t)dx=w(p,t)dp, x=lnp/pc, we get 
 

   

(18) 

and with the transformation 

 

 

(19) 

our generalized Black-Scholes pde (18) becomes  

       
 
which  is  a  very  beautiful  result!  This  pde  is  exactly  the  backward  time 
equation,  or  first  Kolmogorov  equation,  corresponding  to  the  Fokker-Planck 
pde(the second Kolmogorov equation)

 for the market Green function of returns g, if we choose µ=r in the latter [3]. 
With  the  choice  µ=r,  then  both  pdes  are  solved  by  the  same  Green 
function  g,  so  that  no  information  is  provided  by  solving  the  option 
pricing  pde  (18)  that  is  not  already  contained  in  the  Green  function  of 
the Market  F-P equation (21). To be explicit, according to the theory of 
backward time integration [13,14] we must understand (20) as 
 
 

 

 

(22) 

where v(xo,to)=g(x,t;xo,to) solves the Fokker-Planck pde (21) in (x,t). This 
is  a  result  that  physicists  should  love:  everything  of  interest  can  be 
calculated once one has the Green function. 
 
We  can  now  use  the  market  Green  function  g  to  price  calls,  e.g.,  risk 
neutrally as 
 

 
where xT=lnpT/pc and x=lnp/pc where p is the price at present time t (T 
is  the  expiration  time,  and  K  is  the  strike  price).  In  the  delta-hedge 
model,  finance  theorists  take  the  arbitrary  interest  rate  r  to  be  the 
riskfree (bank or CD) rate.  

, 

(23) 

Note that the empirical density of returns is given by g(x,t;0,0) =f(x,t). If 
in  the  call  price  (22)  we  restrict  to  x=0,  so  that  p≈pc  and  take  R(x,t)=µ-
D(x,t)/2≈constant  in  (22)  and  use  the  exponential  density  (3)  with 
H=1/2,  then  we  essentially  obtain  the  formulae  that  we  used  much 
earlier to price options empirically correctly [2,3]. This means that we’ve 
approximated  an  arbitrary  stock  price  p  at  present  time  t<T  by  the 
consensus  price  pc.  That  this  doesn’t  get  us  into  trouble  indicates  that 
option  pricing  is  not  very  sensitive  to  some  details.  Indeed,  option

market  dynamics.  But  there’s  still  our  approximation  to  worry  about, 
that we’ve treated R as if it were a constant: We have shown earlier [2,3] 
by  direct  calculations  for  the  exponential  density  that,  even  with 
R(x,t)=µ-D(x,t)≠constant,  we  still  obtain  approximately  the  scaling 
density (3) for times t that are small on a time scale of 100 years. All that 
remains  is  to  explain  why  we  can  get  away  with  ignoring  fat  tails  to 
option  pricing.  Here,  we  are  strictly  physicists,  not  mathematicians:  in 
part 6 we ask the market if fat tails are taken into account. 
 
 
5. Martingales and Option Pricing  
 
We  can  show  that  the  generalized  B-S  pde  above  is  equivalent  to  a 
Martingale  in  the  risk  neutral  discounted  stock  price.  The  B-S  pde  is 
equivalent

(24) 

The  call  price  is  calculated  from  the  Green  function  v=g+(x,t;xT,T)  of 
this  pde,  where  the  dagger  denotes  the  adjoint.  The  forward  time 
Kolmogorov pde 

 

 

 

has  exactly  the  same  Green  function  g(xT,T;x,t)=g+(x,t;xT,T).  The  price 
sde  corresponding  to  this  Fokker-Planck  pde  (dropping  subscripts 
capital T, for convenience) is 

 (25) 

 

 

(26) 

where d(p,t)=D(x,t) and r is the risk neutral rate of return. With y=x-rt 
and g(x,x’;t,t’)=G(y,y’;t,t’) (since dx=dy) we obtain

(27) 

   

(28) 

 
and yields the corresponding price sde (with x=lnS(t)/S(0)) 
 
 

 

 

(29) 

 
with  price  diffusion  coefficient  e(S,t)=E(y,t)=D(x,t)=d(p,t).  This  shows 
that the risk neutral discounted price S=pe-rt is a Martingale. 
 
In  practice  we  don’t  know  how  to  calculate  the  full  Green  function 
analytically [7]. So far, we (and all others making an analogous attempt 
[15]) have at best calculated the option price for the consensus price: it’s 
only  the  consensus  price  pc,  and  not  an  arbitrary  initial  price  p(0),  that 
appears in the empirical density f(x,t)=g(x,t;0,0). 
 
We  will  show  in  a  paper  to  follow  [16]  that  the  Green  function 
(‘measure’)  constructed  according  to  Girsanov’s  Theorem  satisfies  the 
Black-Scholes  pde,  so  that  all  possible  paths  to  risk  neutral  option 
pricing  are  in  agreement  with  each  other.  Girsanov’s  theorem  is  often 
stated  in  financial  math  texts  [17,18]  as  transforming  a  Wiener  process 
plus a drift term into another Wiener  process. This is wrong: when the 
drift  depends  on  a  random  variable  x  and  is  not  merely  t-dependent, 
then the resulting process is not Wiener. Durrett [19] proves Girsanov’s 
theorem  in  the  generality  needed  for  empirically  based  option  pricing: 
one  starts  with  any  Martingale  x(t)  (e.g.,  dx=√D(x,t)dB  generates  a 
Martingale),  adds  an  (x,t)  dependent  drift  term,  and  then  constructs  a 
new Martingale. The new Martingale is not a Wiener process unless (a) 
the old process is Wiener, and (b) the drift is not a function of a random 
variable  x(t)  [16].  The  sole  exception  to  this  rule  is  the  lognormal  sde 
2x2dB  with  σ1  constant,  which  is  trivially  ‘Wiener’  by  the 
dx=µxdt+σ1
simple coordinate transformation y=lnx. 
 
That  the  Black-Scholes  pde  is  equivalent  to  a  Martingale  in  the  risk 
neutral discounted stock price  was proven abstractly, and for our taste

proof  above  is  transparent  and  is  not  restricted  to  the  unphysical 
assumption that D(x,t) is independent of x. 
 
6. Option Pricing with Fat Tails 
 
Consider  the  price  of  a  call  for  x>δ  where  u=(x-δ)/√t,  where  δ  is 
determined by the consensus price pc: 
 

 
and p is the known stock price at present time t<T. We know the Green 
function  both  empirically  and  analytically  only  for  the  case  where 
g(x,t;0,0)=f(x,t). This yields 
 

, 

(30) 

 
and this special case is adequate for making our next point: the observed 
density (the empirical density) has fat tails f(x,t)≈x-µ for x>>1, so we get 
 

, 

(31) 

 

(32) 

 
This  result  is  exact  and  can  be  extended  via  continuity  to  other  option 
prices p≠pc. That is, traders co not and cannot take fat tails into account 
for  arbitrarily  large  returns  x.  If  one  inserts  a  finite  cutoff,  then  the 
option  price  is  very  sensitive  to  the  cutoff,  meaning  that  one  can  then 
predict essentially any option price. Again, that the exponential model, a 
model  without  fat  tails,  predicts  option  prices  correctly  indicates  that 
options traders do not worry about fat tails in returns. 
 
Many papers can be found in the literature and on the web purporting 
to  price  options  using  fat  tails.  All  are  in  serious  error  in  one  way  or 
another. In Borland [15], there are several mathematical mistakes in the 
analysis. In that model the diffusion coefficient is [7]

where

 .   (35)   

 
 
One mistake is that in the attempt to construct a price Martingale using 
this  quadratic  coefficient  a  term  ∫x2(t)/t2Hdt  appears  in  the  exponential 
factor  derived  from  applying  Girsanov’s  Theorem.  That  term  was 
treated  incorrectly  as  ∫x2(t)/t2Hdt  α  x2(T)/T2H,  where  T  is  the  expiration 
time for the option and the average is over the return x(T) at expiration. 
That  mistake  gave  rise  to  a  spurious  Gaussian  convergence  factor  that 
does not appear in the correct option pricing formula.  
 
That the substitution is wrong is easy to see: equations (71) and (143) in 
ref. [15] assert that

where  (translating  the  different  notations)  Borland’s  variable  Ω  is  our 
variable x. In our notation, this is equivalent to asserting that u(t)=u(T).

Long-term  investigations  of  radiocaesium  activity  concentrations  in  carps  in  the 

Republic  of  Croatia are presented. The radiocaesium levels in carps decreased exponentially 
and  the  effective  ecological  half-life  of  137Cs  in  carps  was  estimated  to  be  about  1  year  for 

1987-2002 period and 5 years for 1993-2005 period.  

The observed 134Cs:137Cs activity ratio in carps has been found to be similar to the ratio 

that has been observed in other environmental samples. 

Concentration factor for carps (wet weight) was roughly estimated to be 128 ± 74 Lkg-1, 

which is in reasonable agreement with model prediction based on K+ concentrations in water. 

Estimated annual effective doses received by 134Cs and 137Cs intake due to consumption 

of carps for an adult member of Croatian population are small, per caput dose for the 1987 – 

2005 estimated to be 0.5 ± 0.2 µSv.  

Due  to  minor  freshwater  fish  consumption  in  Croatia  and  low  radiocaesium  activity 

concentrations in carps, it can be concluded that carps consumption was not a critical pathway 

for the transfer of radiocaesium from fallout to humans after the Chernobyl accident.

1. Introduction 

 

Nuclear  tests  conducted  in  the  atmosphere  and  releases  of  radioactive  material  from 

nuclear  facilities  are  the  main  causes  of  man-made  radioactive  contamination  of  the 

environment.  Once  released  to  the  atmosphere,  long-range  atmospheric  transport  processes 

can cause widespread distribution of such radioactive matter, although it may, as in the case of 

the Chernobyl accident, originate from a single point. 

The  resulting  fallout,  consisting  of  short  and  long-lived  radionuclides,  eventually 

impacts on humans, either directly or indirectly, by entering the food chain through plants and 

animals.  In  both  cases  radiation  exposure  represents  a  potential  health  hazard  to  the 

population through the direct irradiation and consumption of contaminated foodstuffs. 

Among man-made radionuclides, those of caesium and strontium, particularly 137Cs and 
90Sr,  are  regarded  as  a  particular  hazard  to  organisms.  This  results  from  the  unique 

combinations  of  relatively  long  half-lives  (30.14  and  29.12  years,  respectively)  and  the 

chemical and metabolic properties of these radionuclides, which closely resemble  potassium 

and calcium, respectively. 

Investigations  of  the  distribution  and  fate  of  natural,  nuclear  weapons-produced  and 

reactor-released radionuclides in foodstuffs, including freshwater fish, have been conducted as 

a part of an extended and ongoing monitoring programme of radioactive contamination of the 

environment in Croatia (Popović, 1966-1978; Bauman et al., 1979 – 1992; Kovač et al., 1993 

– 1998; Marović et al., 1999 - 2006). Regular measurements of radioactive contamination of 

freshwater fish started one year after the Chernobyl accident, in 1987. 

 

Among the freshwater fish studied, special attention has been given to the common carp 

(Cyprinus  carpio).  As  a  widespread  and  rapidly  breeding  freshwater  fish,  carp  species  are 

fished  and  farmed  across  the  world.  In  Croatia,  carp  represent  the  majority  of  the  total 

freshwater fish catch and consumption. During the period 1991 – 2005, the total catch of carp 

in  Croatia  was  about  55,000  tonnes  or  3,800  ±  1,550  tonnes  annually  (Central  Bureau  of 

Statistics, 2000 – 2006). As virtually all this catch is consumed in Croatia, it implies an annual 

consumption  of  about  0.9  kg  of  carp  per  person.  Unfortunately,  data  for  carp  catch  and 

consumption for the 1987 – 1990 period are unavailable for the Republic of Croatia.

Common  carp  prefer  large  bodies  of  water  with  slow  or  standing  water  and  soft, 

vegetated sediments. Since they can survive in stagnant and even polluted waters, which most 

other fish do not inhabit, carp represent good bioindicator species for freshwater radioecology. 

2. Materials and methods 

Carp samples were  obtained  once  a  year,  usually  in  late  spring  or  early summer, from 

commercial fish markets in the cities of Zagreb (45° 50' N, 16° 00' E) and Osijek (45° 30' N, 

18° 40' E). Samples of river waters were also collected in the  same cities, (the Sava river in 

Zagreb  and  the  Drava  river  in  Osijek),  usually  in  late  spring.  A  map  showing  the  locations 

(cities of Zagreb and Osijek) of water and fish sampling sites is shown in Figure 1. 

FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE 

From each site, 2 to 4 individual carp were obtained with masses of approximately 2 kg 

per individual. Therefore, they were all “large” (fresh weight more than 0.1 kg) according to 

the classification by Smith et al. (2002). The fish were cut into small pieces in order to obtain 

composite samples. Fish samples were dried in an oven and then ashed in a muffle furnace at 
450 oC for 24 h. The 137Cs activity concentrations in carp are reported on a wet weight basis. 

Samples  of  river  waters  were  collected  in  the  cities  of  Zagreb  (the  Sava  river)  and 
Osijek  (the  Drava  river),  usually  in  late  spring.  Total  137Cs  activity  concentrations,  i.e. 

dissolved and solid forms, were determined in water samples. Prior to analysis, samples of 50 
L were evaporated to 1 L volume in order to concentrate the 137Cs content. It was not possible 

to collect water samples from the local fishponds in which carp were farmed and it is assumed 

that water from adjacent rivers is a good representation of surface waters in the study areas. 

Fallout samples were collected monthly in the city of Zagreb at the Institute for Medical 

Research  and  Occupational  Health  (45°  50'  7.3" N,  15°  58'  58.7" E).  Funnels,  which  were 
used  for  rainwater  collection,  had  a  1 m2  collection  area.  Precipitation  was  measured  by  a 

Hellman  pluviometer.  As  in  the  case  of  river  water  samples,  rainwater  was  evaporated  to  a 
volume of 1 L in order to concentrate the 137Cs activity concentration prior to analysis.

Gamma-ray  spectrometry  systems  based  on  a  low-level  ORTEC  Ge(Li)  detector 
(FWHM  1.87  keV  at  1.33  MeV  60Co  and  relative  efficiency  of  15.4%  at  1.33  MeV)  and 
ORTEC HPGe detector (FWHM 1.75 keV at 1.33 MeV 60Co and relative efficiency of 21% at 

1.33  MeV)  coupled  to  a  computerized  data  acquisition  system  were  used  to  determine 
radiocaesium and  40K levels in the samples from their gamma-ray spectra. Ash from  the fish 

samples  was  packed  in  cylindrical  plastic  containers  of  appropriate  volume,  which  were 

placed  directly  on  the  detector.  River  water  and  fallout  samples  were  measured  in  Marinelli 

beakers.  Counting  times  depended  on  sample  activities,  ranging  from  10,000 to  250,000 

seconds, typically being 80,000 s. 

 

Quality  assurance  and 

intercalibration  measurements  were  performed 

through 

participation in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and World Health Organization 

(WHO) international intercalibration programmes, which include regular checks on blank and 

background samples as well as quality control measurements. 

Radiocaesium  activity  concentrations  in  fish  samples  in  this  paper  were  reported  as 

averages of two sampling locations, which assumes that the water bodies in both locations had 

similar characteristics.  The relative error between both locations never exceeded 25 %. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3. Results and discussion  

3.1.  137Cs activity concentrations in carp 

Fallout  from  highly  radioactive  atmospheric  plumes  originating  from  the  damaged 

Chernobyl nuclear reactor was spread and transported all over Europe. Fortunately, due to the 

prevailing meteorological conditions at the time after the accident, Croatia was only partially 

affected by the edge of one of the plumes (United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects 

of Atomic Radiation, 1988), as indicated in Figure 2. 

FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE 

The  highest  observed  137Cs  activity  concentrations  in  Chernobyl  fallout  were  recorded 
in May 1986, resulting in a surface deposition of 6200 Bq m-2 (Bauman et al., 1978 – 1991; 

4

Franić, 1992a). The highest  137Cs activity concentration recorded in carps was 19.5 ± 1.5 Bq 
 kg-1  in  1987,  while  in  2004  the  value  was  only  0.07  ±  0.01  Bq   kg-1.  The  latter  value  is 
comparable with the 137Cs activity concentration found in the late 1990s for trout (Bauman et 
al., 1978 - 1991) although no data for 137Cs activity concentrations in trout for the 1980s and 

early 1990s are available.  

3.2.  Effective ecological half-life of 137Cs in carp 

To  study  the  time  course  the  137Cs  activity  concentrations  and  to  assess  the  effective 
ecological  half-life  of  137Cs  in  carp,  measurement  data  have  been  graphed  as  a  function  of 

time.  The  distribution  shows  a  relatively  rapid  decrease  during  the  first  six  years  after  the 

Chernobyl accident. After approximately six years, this decrease was significantly less rapid. 

The same pattern has been observed for other fish species (Smith et al., 2000a; Hanslik et. al., 

2005) as well as various other foodstuffs (Schwaiger et al., 2004). 

A first order kinetic equation was used to parameterise time changes in the 137Cs activity 

concentrations in carp. Therefore, for the periods of 1987-1992 and 1993-2005 the measured 

data were fitted to the following exponential function: 

Acarp(t)  = Acarp(0) e – kt 

(1)

 is time-dependent activity concentration of 137Cs in carp (Bqkg-1 wet 

weight), 

Acarp(0)   

 

initial activity concentration of 137Cs in carp (Bqkg-1 wet weight) and  

ln(2)/k=T1/2,eff 

effective (observed) ecological half-life of 137Cs in carp (years). 

In  the  immediate  period  after  the  Chernobyl  accident,  i.e.  1987  –1992  the  observed 
effective ecological half-life of  137Cs in carp was about 1.05 years (r = 0.92, P(t) < 0.01 for 4 
degrees of freedom). However, the effective ecological half-life of  137Cs in carp increased to

Acarp(t)

5.05 years for the 1993 –2005 period (r = 0.82 with P(t) < 0.001 for 11 degrees of freedom). 
The observed and modeled 137Cs activity concentrations in carp are shown in Figure 3. 

FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE 

In  order  to  obtain  the  standard  deviation  of  T1/2,eff,  Monte  Carlo  simulations  were 

performed.  To  ensure  conservative  estimates,  as  well  as  to  simplify  calculations,  a  uniform 

distribution has been assumed over the A ± 2σ value of  137Cs activity concentrations in carp 

for respective years, although a normal distribution would perhaps be more realistic. For each 

year  a  random  value  was  generated  over  the  interval  [A  -  2σ,  A  +  2σ]  and  a  ln(2)/k  value 

estimated  by  fitting  equation  (1)  to  the  stochastically  generated  data.  This  process  was 

repeated 100 times and 100 values for ln(2)/k = T1/2,eff were thus obtained. From this data set 

the mean values and standard deviations for T1/2,eff were calculated to be 1.05 ± 0.06 years for 

1987 – 1992 period and 5.05 ± 0.32 years for 1993 – 2005 period. 

These results are in good agreement with literature data. Hanslik et al. (2005) reported 
the observed 137Cs half-lives for freshwater fish species (both piscivorous and herbivorous) in 

the Vltava River basin (Bohemia) to be about 1 year during 1986 – 1992 and 5.1 years during 

1994  –  2002.  The  effective  ecological  half-life  for  freshwater  fish  in  the  post  Chernobyl 

period  in  Nordic  countries  was  discussed  in  the  Nordic  nuclear  safety  research  report  NKS-

123  (Nielsen  and  Andersson,  2006).  During  1988-2002  the  observed  ecological  half-life  of 
137Cs in perch in Finnish lakes varied from 3 to 9 years while half-lives in trout and in Arctic 

char varied from 1.4 to 4.7 years during 1988 – 2004. Trout in Norwegian lakes experienced a 
more  rapid  reduction  in  137Cs  burdens  compared  with  Finnish  lakes,  the  highest  observed 

ecological half-life, determined for the time period 1989 – 2000, being 6.3 years. Smith et al. 
(2000a)  reported  effective  biological  half-life  of  137C  in  young  fish,  water  and  terrestrial 

vegetation during the first five years after the Chernobyl accident to be 1 – 4 years. However, 
after that period, the effective biological half-life of 137C increased to 6 – 30 years. 

The effective ecological half life results from biological elimination of  137Cs from fish 

as well as radioactive decay.  In order to estimate the ‘true’  ecological half-life the effective 

constants k should be corrected for radioactive decay. Therefore constant k from the equation 

(1) can be written as: 

 

 

 

 

6

k = λ + kR 

(2)

where ln(2)/λ = 30.14 y is the physical half-life of 137Cs and ln(2)/kR = T1/2,e is ecological half-
life for 137Cs.  

From equation (2) the ‘true’ ecological half-lives for  137Cs in carp T1/2,e were found to 

be 1.09 ± 0.06 and 6.06 ± 0.47 years, which are slightly higher than the effective ecological 

half-lives for the respective ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ periods. 

3.3.  137Cs :  134Cs activity ratio in carp 

 

The  presence  of  134Cs  (half-life  of  2.06  years)  in  the  Croatian  environment  was 

detected for the first time in May 1986.  The estimated amount  of caesium released after the 
reactor  explosion  at  Chernobyl  was  3.7 × 1016  Bq  of  137Cs  (13%  of  total  reactor  inventory) 
and  1.9 × 1016  Bq  of  134Cs  (10%  of  total  reactor  inventory  (International  Atomic  Energy 
Agency, 1986).  Thus, the initial value for the 134Cs:137Cs activity ratio in May 1986 was 0.51.  

This activity ratio was not altered during the passage of the radioactive plume from Chernobyl 

to other geographical areas in Europe. 

As  the  half-life  of  137Cs  (30.14  years)  is  about  15  times  longer  than  that  of  134Cs,  the 
134Cs:137Cs  activity  ratio  R(t)  should  decrease,  in  a  predictable  way,  due  to  differential 

radioactive decay, according to the following relationship:

In 1987 the observed  134Cs:137Cs activity ratio in carp was 0.41 ± 0.06, compared with 

the theoretical prediction of 0.38.  In 1988 that ratio was 0.27 ± 0.04 (Figure 4).

Similar  ratios,  decreasing  according  to  equation  (3),  have  been  found  in  most  other 

environmental samples (Bauman et al., 1987  - 1992; Kovač et al., 1993 - 1998; Marović et 

al.,  1999  –  2004;  Franić  et  al.  2006)  the  only  exception  being  mushrooms  (Franić  et.  al, 
1992b).  In  mushrooms,  excess  137Cs  from  pre-Chernobyl  fallout,  affected  the  134Cs:137Cs 
concentration  ratios.  As  134Cs  decayed  and  migrated  to  deeper  layers  within  soils,  the 
observed 134Cs:137Cs concentration ratios approached the values theoretically predicted. 

In 1990 and afterwards, contamination of carp by  134Cs originating from the Chernobyl 

accident was detectable only at a very low level. 

3.4 Concentration factors 

Radionuclides  introduced  into  natural  waters  undergo  various  biological processes and 

may  enter  complicated  food-webs.  Therefore,  a  variety  of  mathematical  models  have  been 

developed  to  predict  the  behavior  and  fate  of  radionuclides  in  fresh  water  ecosystems,  as 

described by IAEA (2000) and Monte et al. (2003). 

Since  one  of  the  routes  of  human  exposure  to  artificial  radionuclides  from  the 

freshwater  environment  is  through  ingestion  of  contaminated  organisms,  it  is  interesting  to 
investigate  the  bioaccumulation  of  137Cs  in  carp.  The  level  of  radioactive  contamination  of 

aquatic  biota  by  specific  radionuclides  is  usually  defined  in  terms  of  a  concentration  factor 

(CF)  which  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  activity  concentration  in  a  biological  material  to  the 

activity concentration in the ambient water: 

         

CF

m =

A
(

(4)

 

is the concentration factor of radionuclide m for a specific organism (L kg-1) 

Am  (organism) 

is the activity concentration of radionuclide m in that organism (Bq kg-1 wet 

weight) and 

Am (water) 

 

s the activity concentration of radionuclide m in water (Bq L-1). 

8

Use of concentration factors assumes equilibrium between organisms and water, which 

may  not  be  the  case  in the  real  environment due to complex inputs of radionuclides and the 

variability  in  parameters  influencing  activity  concentrations  in  abiotic  compartments. 

Concentration  factors  do  not  have  any  mechanistic  basis,  simply  representing  the  ratios  of 

radionuclide  activity  concentrations  between  biological  material  and  ambient  water. 

Nevertheless,  if  the  concentration  factor  of  a  specific  radionuclide  is  known  for  a  given 

organism,  the  level  of  the  radionuclide  activity  concentration  in  this  organism  can  be 

predicted, based on its activity concentration in the ambient water.  

Since  carp  were  obtained  in  fish  markets  in  the  cities  of  Zagreb  and  Osijek,  without 

knowing  the  exact  locations  of  the  fish  farms  from  which  they  came,  CRs  were  calculated 
using  137Cs  activity  concentrations  observed  in  the  rivers  Sava  and  Drava.    The  calculated 
value  of  CF  for  137Cs  in  North  Croatian  carp  is  128  ± 73  L  kg-1.  If  the  data  for  Zagreb  and 
Osijek  are  analyzed separately, respective CFs are 129 ± 64 and 125 ± 82 L kg-1. The small 

deviations in these CF estimates is expected given the assumptions made. It should be noted 

that  non-predatory  fish,  like  carp,  are  expected  to  have  lower  CFs  for  radiocaesium  than 

predatory  fish  (Kryshev,  1995).  Nevertheless,  these  CFs  correspond  with  other  reported  CF 
values  for  134Cs  and  137Cs,  which  fall  in  the  range  3 × 101  –  3  ×103  (IAEA,  1994).  Similar 

ranges of CFs have also been observed by other authors. Strand et al. (1999) reported CFs for 

selected fresh water fish (pike, perch and roach) in artificial reservoirs in the southern Urals, 
(Russia) in the range of 240 –1400 L kg-1. Smith et al. (2000b, 2002) have reported fish-water  
CFs for perch, rudd, roach, gudgeon, ruffe, bream and goldfish in the range 102 – 104 L kg-1 in 

10 lakes in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Hanslik et al. (2005) have reported somewhat greater 

fish-water CFs for the fish sampled in Orlik Reservoir (the Vltava river basin), in the range of 
1000 – 2000 L kg-1. 

Another important factor which affects rates of uptake and elimination of radiocaesium 

in  fish,  and  therefore  CFs,  is  the  influence  of  potassium  as  well  other  chemical  parameters 

(IAEA, 1994; Poon and Au, 1999; Smith et. al., 2002; Smith et al., 2005). Specifically, fish-

water CFs are inversely proportional to potassium concentrations and expressions have been 

derived to describe this relationship (Coughtrey and Thorne, 1983; IAEA, 1994; Smith et al., 

For non-predatory fish, like carp, it has been observed (Smith et al., 2005) that: 

CF ≈ 61.3 / [K+] 

(5)

2005). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where: 

CF 

is the fish-water CF for 137Cs in m3 kg-1 and 

[K+]  is the potassium concentration measured in µmol L-1. 

 
The  potassium  concentrations  in  the  waters  of  the  Drava  and  Sava  rivers,  estimated 
from  gamma  spectrometric  data  for  40K,  were  in  the  range  170  -  250  µmol  L-1.  Similar 
potassium concentrations, 6.7 mg L− 1 (≈ 170 µmol L-1) have been observed elsewhere (Neal 

and Robson, 2000). Therefore, using equation (5), CFs would fit into the range 245 – 370 L 
kg-1  which  is  slightly  higher  than  the  observed  CF  values  for  carp.  It  should  be  noted, 

however,  that  potassium  concentrations  in  some  Croatian  lakes,  as  well  as  ponds,  is 

significantly  higher  than  in  the  Sava  and  Drava  rivers  (Marović  et  al.,  1999  –  2006)  while 
137Cs activity concentrations are quite similar. Consequently, the related CF values for carps 

are likely to be lower than the ones predicted by equation (5) using the data from the Sava and 

Drava rivers. 

3.5  Dosimetry 

 

Due  to  the  relatively  high  contribution  of  ingestion  dose  to  total  dose  received  by  the 

Croatian  population  after  nuclear  fallout  (Lokobauer  et  al.,  1998),  a  reliable  knowledge  of 
ingestion dose is of particular importance. Data on activity concentrations of  134Cs and  137Cs 

in  carp  allow  us  to  estimate  the  doses  incurred  by  consumption  of  this  fish  species.  Dose 

conversion  factors,  i.e.  effective  dose  per  unit  intake  via  ingestion  for  adult  members  of  the 
public,  are  1.3×10-8  SvBq-1  and  1.9×10-8  SvBq-1  for  137Cs  and  134Cs  respectively  (IAEA, 

1996).  As  the  ratio  of  dose  conversion  factors  for  137Cs  and  134Cs  is  ≈  0.7,  it  implies  that 
ingestion  of  134Cs  contributes  about  30%  more  to  the  dose,  compared  with  ingestion  of  the 
same activity concentration of 137Cs. 

10

In  the  Republic  of  Croatia,  overall  consumption  of  fish,  including  fresh  water  and  sea 

species, is relatively small, being between 7 and 8 kg per year per person (Central Bureau of 

Statistics, 2000 – 2006).  The collective effective dose incurred due to food consumption over 

a  specific  time  period  depends  on  the  activity  concentration  within  the  food  and  on  the 

quantity of that food which is consumed. The dose can be expressed as: 

m ADCE ∑=

cf

m

 

m

(6)

where: 

E 

C 

cf

is the effective dose in Sv, 

is the total annual per capita consumption of food, 

mD   is the dose conversion factor for radionuclide m, i.e. effective dose per unit intake, which 

converts the ingested activity to effective dose and 

Am 

is the mean annual specific activity of radionuclide m in food (Bqkg-1). 

Based  on  the  statistical  data  for  the  consumption  of  carp  during  1991  –  2005  (3800  ± 

1550 tonnes annually) the same consumption rate was assumed for the period 1987 – 1990 as 
well.  The  estimated  collective  effective  dose  due  to  137Cs  and  134Cs  ingestion  by  carp 
consumption for the Croatian population (4.5 ×106 inhabitants) during 1987-2005 is 2.2 ± 0.9 
person-Sv. 1.5 ± 0.6 person-Sv can be attributed to 137Cs and 0.7 ± 0.3 person-Sv to 134Cs. The 

majority of the overall dose was incurred during the 1987 (1.0 ± 0.4 person-Sv and 0.6 ± 0.2 
person-Sv for 137Cs and 134Cs, respectively). 

The annual effective collective doses are shown in Figure 5. 

FIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE 

It should be noted that the doses were not corrected to take into account inedible parts of 

the  fish  such  as  bones  and  scales.  Nevertheless,  these  are  rather  small  doses,  since  for  the 

1987 – 2005 period per capita dose is . 0.5 ± 0.2 µSv.  However, the doses are small not only 

because  of  low  activity  concentrations  of  radiocaesium  in  carp,  but  also  due  to  the  low 

consumption of freshwater fish in Croatia.  In summary, it can be argued that freshwater fish

consumption  is  not  a  critical  pathway  for  human  intake  of  radiocaesium  from  the 

environment. 

4. Conclusions 

A relatively rapid decrease in 137Cs activity concentrations in carp was observed for the 
immediate post-Chernobyl period (1987 – 1992), the effective ecological half-life of  137Cs in 

carp within this period being approximately 1 year. However, approximately 6 years after the 

accident,  this  rate  of  decrease  slowed  significantly  and  the  effective  ecological  half-life  of 
137Cs  in  carp  increased  to  5  years,  the  same  pattern  being  observed  for  some  other  fish  and 

other foodstuffs. 

The concentration factor (CF) for carp (wet weight) was estimated to be 128 ± 74 L kg-
1,  a  value  which  is  in  reasonable  agreement  with  model  predictions  based  on  K+ 

concentrations in water as well as with CF values observed elsewhere. 

The activity concentrations of  137Cs in carp became quite low within a few years after 
the  Chernobyl  nuclear  accident,  while  134Cs  activity  concentrations  were  generally  below 

detection  limit  after  1990.  Consequently,  only  very  low  doses  have  been  received  by  the 

general population as a result of freshwater fish consumption and it can be concluded that carp 

consumption was not a critical pathway for the transfer of radiocaesium to humans after the 

Chernobyl accident.

Abstract

In  fabricating  the  first  X-Band  RDDS  (Rounded
Damped  Detuned  Structure)  accelerator 
structure,
microwave  measurements  are  made  on  short  groups  of
discs  prior  to  bonding  the  discs  of  the  entire  structure.
The  design  dispersion  curves  are  compared  with  the
frequency measurements.  The theory utilised is based on
a circuit model adapted to a short stack of slowly varying
non-uniform  discs.    The  model  reveals  the  nature  of  the
modes  in  the  structure  and  may  also  be  used  to  refit  the
experimental  data  to  the  parameters  in  a  model  of  the
wakefield  given  earlier  [1].    This  method  allows  a  more
faithful  determination  of  the  wakefield  that  a  beam  will
experience as it traverses the structure.  Results obtained
on the frequencies are compared to the original design.

1. INTRODUCTION

     The  design  and  fabrication  of 
the  first  RDDS
accelerator  structure  (RDDS1)  is  described  in  [2].    The
basic fabrication units of the structure are discs consisting
of  a  rounded  beam  iris  and  a  pair  of  identical  half  cells
one  on  each  side  of  the  iris.    The  disc  also  includes  the
four  circular  waveguide  sections  which  form  the  four
manifolds together with the coupling slots which connect
them to the cells.  Further details are found in [2] and [3].
Microwave  measurements  were  performed  during  the
fabrication procedure to provide quality assurance.  These
were  of  two  sorts.    The  first  consisted  of  resonance
frequency measurements on a single disc terminated with
flat conducting plates in pressure contact with the disc [3].
The  second  consisted  of  similar  measurements  on  stacks
of  six  successive  discs  (eg  disc  n  to  disc  n+5)  carefully
aligned and pressed together between two flat conducting
plates.  Each  end  plate  was  provided  with  an  off  center
probe,  similarly  placed  within  the  cell  (rather  than  the
manifold) region, and at an azimuth such that they faced
one  another.  Both  monopole  and  dipole

information that one might hope to aquire from the single
disc  measurements  would  be  the  accelerating  mode
frequency (ie the 2p /3 monopole), which is supposed to be
the  same  for  each  disc,  and  the  tuning  profile  of  the
synchronous  frequency  of 
lowest  dipole  mode.
Although  this  information  is  not  provided  directly,  the
accelerating  mode  frequency  is  expected  to  be  given  to
adequate accuracy from the monopole mode frequencies f0
and fp  by the formula

The lower dipole pi mode frequency is  very  close  to  the
synchronous frequency, so that its profile can provide an
adequate  surrogate  for  the  synchronous  mode  profile.
Also, these two frequencies uniquely determine two of the
equivalent circuit parameters (independently of the values
of the other parameters), which may then be compared to
profiles for these two parameters obtained by interpolation
formulas  from  the  five  cells  actually  simulated.    Further
details  regarding  the  application  of  the  single  disc
measurements  may  be  found  in  [3],  especially  on  the
development  of  a  rapid  routine  quality  assurance
procedure  that  could  be  integrated  into  a  manufacturing
process.

With  the  six  disc  stacks,  more  resonances  can  be
observed,  thereby  providing  more  complete  information
regarding  the  accuracy  of  machining,  simulation,  and
equivalent circuit representation.  Of particular interest is
the fact that each of the stacks should, despite the fact that
they are made up of discs dimensioned to fit the detuning
profile, should have a 2p /3 phase advance monopole mode
all  with 
the
acceleration  mode.    Since  the  completed  structure  is
driven at 11.424GHz, a frequency error in the acceleration
mode  of  a  particular  stack  will  translate  into  a  phase
advance  error. 
these  measurements  were
performed  while 
progress,
compensating  dimensional  changes  could  be  made  in
subsequently  fabricated  cells  so  as 
the
accumulation of phase errors [2].  The stacks also provide
more detailed information about the Brillouin diagram of
the  dipole  modes.    As  discussed  below,  this  information
will  be  used  to  obtain  more  accurate  information  on  the
synchronous  frequency  profile  and  on  the  coupling
between the lower  dipole modes and the manifold.

     We first  consider  the  case  of  a  uniform  N  disc  stack.
Our  attention  will  be  focussed  on  the  modes  associated
with the first monopole band, the first  two  dipole  bands,
and  the  first  bands  associated  with  the  four  manifolds.
These  are  the  low  lying  modes  found  in  single  disc
simulations with periodic boundary conditions, their bands
being 
the  phase  advance.
(Historically,  one  quarter  of  a  single  cell  is  simulated,
with  symmetry-symmetry  boundary  conditions  for  the
monopole and a pair of nearly degenerate manifold bands,
and metallic-symmetry boundary conditions for the lower
two dipole bands and a manifold band.  The results would
be  identical  for  a  disc.)    The  modes  of  an  N  disc  stack
terminated  at  each  end  by  a  conducting  plate  are  equal
amplitude  superpositions  of  the  two  oppositely  directed
travelling  wave  solutions.    One  may  think  of  one
boundary as determining their relative phase, and then the
relative phase required by the other boundary determines
which  phase  advances  correspond  to  modes.    The  "band
edge"  solutions  (ie  0  and  p
  phase  advance)  are  standing
rather than running waves, and are missing or included in
the mode spectrum accordingly as they do or do not fit the
imposed  boundaries.    For  the  N  disc  stack  one  expects
modes corresponding to phase advances (n/N)p
, with n =
0,1...N for the monopole band modes, n = 1,...N-1 for the
modes of the manifold bands.  The differences arise from
the  fact  that  the  former  are  TM  and  the  latter  TE.    The
dipole  bands  are  TE-TM  hybrids,  but  at  the  band  edges
one or the other predominates.  The consequence is that n
= 0 is missing  from  the  lower  dipole  band  and  n  =  pi  is
missing from the upper dipole band.  The four modes of
the  N  =  1  case  discussed  above  are  illustrative  of  these
rules.    The  total  number  of  modes  of  an  N  disc  stack
associated  with  the  bands  specified  is  9N  -  3  (counting
both dipole orientations).
Experimental  study  of  a  uniform  stack  would  provide  a
check on the Brillouin diagram obtained from simulation.
Also  for  N  a  multiple  of  three  the  sequence  of  phase
advances  represented  includes  2p /3.    Thus  one  gets  a
better  check  on  the  accelerating  mode  frequency  by
studying  such  stacks.    The  RDDS1  disc  fabrication  was
checked for the entire structure by measuring 34 six disc
stacks.  The measured stacks belonged to the sequence of
detuned  cells  and  were  therefore  not  uniform,  but  as
mentioned above this does not affect the frequency of the
accelerating  mode.  For  the  monopole  band  observations,
only the accelerating mode frequency was  recorded.  The
frequencies of all dipole modes which could be seen from
the  probes  were  also  recorded.  These  included  the  six
lower  and  upper  dipole  modes  with  probe  coupled
orientation,  and  those  dipole  phased  manifold  modes
strongly enough coupled to the cells to be seen  from  the
probes

DETUNED N DISC STACKS.

The equivalent circuit of [1] was designed to represent the
first two dipole bands, and the first manifold band of the
DDS  and  RDDS  structures.  (Because  the  manifolds
include  a  transmission  line  in  their  representation,  there
are solutions to the circuit equations which refer to higher
order manifold bands, but  they  have  not  been  tailored  to
represent the actual higher order manifold bands with any
reliability.)    The  actual  structure  contains  a  degenerate
pair for each of these bands, but the circuit models only

illustrated  in  Fig.  (1).    Here,  to  conform  to  earlier
notations, we number the discs 1/2,..N-1/2.   The  full  LC
circuits  between  discs  n-1/2  and  n+1/2  (n  =1,...,N-1)
represent  the  hybrid  TE-TM  modes  of  the  cells  between
the  discs.    Their  loop  currents  are  represented  by  the
nˆa  respectively for the TE and TM circuits
amplitudes an, 
respectively.    The  shunted  transmission  line  sections  n
correspond to the portion of the manifold adjacent to the
n’th cell and are represented by the amplitude variables An
proportional  to  the  voltages  across  the  shunt.    The  half
cells  at  the  ends  of  the  TM  chain  with  doubled  C  and
halved L correspond to the region between the end discs
and  the  shorting  plates,  with  amplitudes  represented  by
0ˆa   and 
Nˆa ,  and  the  manifold  transmission  lines  are
shorted  at  a  distance  one  period  away  from  the  adjacent
shunts.
  Analogous to [1] the homogeneous circuit equations may
be written in the form:

the equations could be removed by rescaling 
but  the  form  of  the  eigenvectors  is  simpler  with  the

remaining  frequencies  at  these  phase  values  represent
pure TM modes for which K1 can be assigned an arbitrary
non-zero value.  For the detuned case numerical methods
must be used to determine both the  eigenvectors  and  the

frequencies were determined by finding the frequencies at
which the determinant of the coefficients vanishes.  This
root search process was greatly facilitated by starting from
the modal frequencies of a uniform stack with parameters
corresponding  to  those  of  the  average  cell  in  the  stack.
These  may  be  obtained  from  the  interpolation  procedure
described  in  [4].  Once  the  modal  frequencies  are  known

of  the  modal  frequencies  from  those  of  the  average  cell
uniform  stack  is  usually  quite  small,  in  which  case  the
individual  modes  can  still  be  designated  by  band  and
phase advance. Ambiguities can arise when there is near
degeneracy.  Although  distorted  by  detuning,  equivalent
circuit eigenvectors can help resolve them. Likewise, the
phase and magnitude of S_12 at the resonant peaks can do
the same for the stack experimental measurements
   We  conclude  with  an  example  based  on  the  stack
formed by the six discs 98 to 103. The space between disc
100  and  101  constitutes  the  average  cell,  which  we
designate as cell 100.5. Its Brillouin diagram is shown in
Fig. (2), and experimental points are also plotted. Table 1
provides  a  numerical  comparison  between  experimental
points,  detuned  stack  equivalent  circuit  computed  points,
and points for a uniform 6 disc stack with parameters for
cell 100.5. The particular frequencies selected for display
in the table are thought to be the most relevant for wake
prediction  because  of  their  bearing  on  cell  to  manifold
coupling  and  synchronous  frequency  identification.  The
equivalent  circuit  computed  shifts  of  the  detuned  stack
frequencies  from  the  uniform  average  stack  frequencies
are indeed quite small in this case, so that the association
of  the  detuned  stack  frequencies  with  the  uniform  stack
phas advances and bands seems quite unambiguous. Also
the eigenvectors do provide support for the identification,
although  some  of  the  patterns  do  show  considerable
distortion. 
the  experimental
frequencies with phase advances and bands is so far based
primarily on the pattern. The association of the lower 60
degree  and  higher  120  degree  frequencies  with  the
manifold is, however, supported by the small amplitude of
their  S12  peaks.  We  note  that  associated  with  each  stack
we will have typically 27 measured frequencies, 12 from
the single disc and usually 15 from the six cell stack. It is
our  intention  to  use  this  data  to  refine  our  parameter
interpolation  curves  and  our  synchronous  frequency
profile, and to thereby improve our wake predictions, but
we do not yet have a tested methodology for doing so.

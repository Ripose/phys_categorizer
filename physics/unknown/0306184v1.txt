Abstract
Background: In a number of recent experiments with food-and-mouth disease virus, a deleterious
mutant, RED, was found to avoid extinction and remain in the population for long periods of time.
Since RED characterizes the past evolutionary history of the population, this observation was called
quasispecies  memory.  While  the  quasispecies  theory  predicts  the  existence  of  these  memory
genomes, there is a disagreement between the expected and observed mutant frequency values.
Therefore, the origin of quasispecies memory is not fully understood.

Results: We propose and analyze a simple model of complementation between the wild type virus
and a mutant that has an impaired ability of cell entry, the likely cause of fitness differences between
wild type and RED mutants. The mutant will go extinct unless it is recreated from the wild type
through  mutations.  However,  under  phenotypic  mixing-and-hiding  as  a  mechanism  of
complementation,  the  time  to  extinction  in  the  absence  of  mutations  increases  with  increasing
multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.). If the RED mutant is constantly recreated by mutations, then its
frequency at equilibrium under selection-mutation balance also increases with increasing m.o.i. At
high  m.o.i.,  a  large  fraction  of  mutant  genomes  are  encapsidated  with  wild-type  protein,  which
enables them to infect cells as efficiently as the wild type virions, and thus increases their fitness to
the wild-type level. Moreover, even at low m.o.i. the equilibrium frequency of the mutant is higher
than predicted by the standard quasispecies model, because a fraction of mutant virions generated
from wild-type parents will also be encapsidated by wild-type protein.

Conclusions: Our model predicts that phenotypic hiding will strongly influence the population
dynamics of viruses, particularly at high m.o.i., and will also have important effects on the mutation-
selection balance at low m.o.i. The delay in mutant extinction and increase in mutant frequencies
at equilibrium may, at least in part, explain memory in quasispecies populations.

Background
RNA  viruses  are  important  pathogens  in  humans,  ani-
mals,  and  plants.  Their  short  generation  time  and  high
mutation  rates allow them  to adapt rapidly to changing
environmental conditions, and make them ever-changing
targets for anti-viral therapies or vaccinations. RNA viruses

form  highly  polymorphic  clouds  of  mutants,  so-called
quasispecies [1–3]. At viral loads of 108 or more virions in
an infected host, viral quasispecies in vivo often contain all
possible  single-point  mutants 
the  consensus
sequence, as well as a sizeable fraction of two- or three-
point mutants [4]. Besides their importance as pathogens,

RNA viruses have in recent years also become one of the
main  tools  for  experimental  verification  of  theoretical
population  genetics  and  evolutionary  theory  in  general
(reviewed in [3]). This line of research can draw on a sub-
stantial  body  of  literature  on  the  theory  of  quasispecies
dynamics and its relation to standard population genetics
[5–16].

The  quasispecies  theory  has  been  useful  to  understand
RNA virus evolution, but the assumptions underlying the
model do not always reflect the biology of RNA viruses. In
some instances the original model has been corrected to
account for discrepancies, such as infinite vs. finite popu-
lation  sizes  [7,9,16].  However,  other  factors  need  to  be
considered as well. For instance, the standard quasispecies
model assumes low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.), that
is, each cell is assumed to be infected by at most one vir-
ion. At high m.o.i., when several virions coinfect a single
cell,  the  virions  can  recombine  [17–19]  or  reassort  (for
segmented viruses) [20–25]. Second, the model assumes
that the genotype of a virion fully determines its fitness.
However,  this  assumption  is  not  always  justified,  since
many viral functions can be provided in trans – an effect
referred to as complementation. Thus, the phenotype of a
virion  may  not  reflect  its  genotype  [26–29].  Phenotypic
mixing  and  hiding  is  a  particular  case  of  complementa-
tion involving surface proteins (above citations). It occurs
either at high m.o.i., when two or more different mutants
or virus strains freely exchange genetic sequences and sur-
face proteins inside a cell, or at low m.o.i., when a mutant
offspring is encapsidated by its parent's proteins.

No  general  theory  is  available  for  the  evolutionary
dynamic  of  a  viral  quasispecies  under  the  influence  of
virus density as it changes with changing m.o.i. However,
some particular cases have been studied [30–32], mostly
related to recombination and reassortment [33–36] and
to the dynamic of defective interfering particles [37–41].
In this paper, we modify the quasispecies model by incor-
porating phenotypic hiding between wild-type virus and a
deleterious  mutant.  We  assume  that  the  mutant  differs
from the wild type in a surface protein necessary for cell
entry, so that the fitness difference between two virions is
solely determined by the surface proteins, and not by the
particular genomes they carry. We show that phenotypic
hiding  of  the  mutant  genome  behind  wild-type  capsids
increases the mutant frequency above the level predicted
by  the  standard  quasispecies  model.  This  increase  in
mutant frequency is most pronounced at high m.o.i., but
exists also at very low m.o.i. Moreover, we show that the
decrease of mutant frequency from an initially high level
down to the level of mutation-selection balance is slowed
down substantially at high m.o.i. because of phenotypic
hiding.

We  propose  that  our  model  may  explain  some  of  the
quantitative differences observed between theoretical pre-
dictions of the quasispecies model and experimental data
published in the literature [42–45]. Foot-and-mouth dis-
ease virus (FMDV) has been one of the most productive
models of viral quasispecies dynamics (reviewed in [46]).
FMDV belongs to the Picornaviridea family. It has a non-
segmented, positive strand genome of approximately 8.5
Kb encapsidated by viral proteins, VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4.
A conserved Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) triplet
in βG-βH loop of VP1 recognizes the αvβ3, αvβ6 or αvβ1
integrin as viral receptor (reviewed in Ref. [47]), the first
necessary step for virus entry. Work carried out with differ-
ent  RGD  virus  mutants  and  mimic  peptides  [48–52]
clearly demonstrates the critical role that the RGD triplet
has  in  virus  entry,  and  its  little  tolerance  to  variation.
Among the few RGD mutants that have been isolated, on
is RED, a low fitness mutant in which the glycine is replace
by glutamic acid [53]. Ruíz-Jarabo and co-workers found
that after revertant RGD genomes became dominant, and
mutant genomes were no longer detected in the consen-
sus sequence, RED was able to remain in the population
for  very  long  times  and  at  surprisingly  high  frequencies
[42–45]. There is a qualitative agreement between the pre-
dictions  of  the  quasispecies  model  and  this  result,  but
there  is  also  a  quantitative  discrepancy.  RED  memory
genomes can be observed at much higher frequency than
expected. However, phenotypic hiding promotes a decel-
erated decay of mutant genomes in the population, and
this decelerated decay could be interpreted as a memory
effect, in agreement with the results by Ruíz-Jarabo et al.
The research design of the original work [42–45] does not
allow us to conclusively accept or reject our model as the
correct explanation for their observations, but the values
of mutant frequencies predicted by our model are consist-
ent with the experimental data.

Model
We assume that the virus is propagated under serial trans-
fer, and model the change in mutant concentrations from
passage to passage. We assume that the difference between
wild type and mutant lies in the capsid proteins, such that
the mutation affects the ability of the virus to enter a cell,
but not the viability of the virus inside the cell. Under phe-
notypic mixing and hiding, there are four types of virions
that can occur: wild-type genotype with wild-type pheno-
type, wild-type genotype with mutant phenotype, mutant
genotype  with  wild-type  phenotype,  and  mutant  geno-
type with mutant phenotype. We will call virions whose
genotype coincides with their phenotype as pure, and vir-
ions for which genotype and phenotype do not coincide
as mixed. In the following paragraphs, we outline the der-
ivation of a set of deterministic equations that describe the
change in relative concentrations of the different pure and
mixed virions in an infinite virus population. More details
are given in the Methods section. Our model is similar to
models studied by Szathmáry [38,39].

The probability pww that an offspring virion is pure wild

2
xw

type is pww = (1 - r)xw + r
 [Methods section, Eq. (14)],
where xw is the probability with which a particular virion
that infects a cell contains the wild-type genome, and r is
a parameter related to the multiplicity of infection. Like-
wise, the probabilities pwm and pmw that an offspring virion
is  mixed  of  either  type  are  pwm =  pmw =  rxwxm [Eq.  (15)],
where xm = 1 - xw, and the probability pmm that an offspring

2
xm

virion is pure mutant is pmm = (1 - r)xm + r
. The formula
that relates the parameter r to the multiplicity of infection,
Eq.  (13),  is  somewhat  unwieldy.  For  reference,  and  in
order to provide an intuitive meaning for r, we have tabu-
lated r (which we will call in the following also the mixing
parameter) versus the m.o.i. in Table 1.

The probabilities xw and xm depend on the composition of
the types of free virions on infection. Assume that yww is
the concentration of pure wild-type virions  at passage t,
ywm  that  of  mixed  virions  with  wild-type  genotype  and
mutant phenotype, ymw that of mixed virions with mutant
genotype and wild-type phenotype, and ymm that of pure
mutant  virions.  Further,  assume  that  virions  with  wild-
type phenotype infect cells at a rate γw, while virions with
mutant phenotype infect at a rate γm < γw. Then, the total
rate at which cells are infected with wild-type genomes is
γwyww  +  γmywm.  Likewise,  the  total  rate  at  which  cells  are
infected with mutant genomes is γwymw + γmymm. Therefore,
we have xw = (γwyww + γmywm)/[γm(ywm + ymm)]. The probabil-
ity xm follows from xm = 1 - xw.

Using the various formulas given in the previous two par-
agraphs, we find that the virion concentrations at passage
t + 1 (primed quantities) are given by

We now introduce mutations into this model. We assume
that the wild type mutates into the mutant with probabil-
ity µ. For simplicity, we assume that back mutations occur
at  the  same  rate.  (It  is  safe  to  make  this  assumption,
because  the  rate  of  back  mutations  from  deleterious  to
advantageous mutants tends to have little effect on muta-
tion-selection balance.) Mutations will typically not affect
the  phenotype  of  the  offspring  virion,  which  is  deter-
mined by the distribution of mutant or wild-type capsid
proteins in the cell. The extended model with mutations
therefore becomes

Results
Extinction of mutant for µ = 0
In order to evaluate whether the mutant can coexist with
the wild type or will ultimately go extinct if it is not con-
stantly  regenerated  through  mutations,  we  have  to  ana-
lyze  the  fixed  points  of  Eqs.  (1a)–(1d).  There  are  two
trivial fixed points, corresponding to the cases in which all
virions are either pure wild-type or pure mutant. We could
not find any non-trivial fixed points. Since the expressions
involved  are  extremely  unwieldy,  we  searched  for  non-
trivial fixed points only numerically (using the function
NSolve of Mathematica [54]).

A  linear  expansion  around  the  fixed  points  tells  us
whether the mutant can invade an established wild-type
population or vice versa. If we introduce a small amount
ε of mutant virions into an established wild-type popula-
tion, the total amounts of wild-type genomes Yw = yww +
ywm and mutant genomes Ym = ymm + ymw after the next pas-
sage become to first order in ε:

As long as γm/γw < 1 (as we assume throughout this paper),
the  amount  of  mutant  genomes  in  the  population
decreases  in  the  first  passage,  which  implies  that  the
mutant cannot invade. Likewise, if we introduce a small
amount ε of wild-type virions into an established mutant

population,  the  total  amounts  of  mutant  and  wild-type
genomes after the next passage become to first order in ε:

In  this  case,  the  amount  of  the  invading  wild-type
genomes in the population increases, which implies that
the wild-type can invade an established mutant popula-
tion.  The  invasion  of  a  mutant  population  by  a  small
amount of wild-type virions is shown in Fig. 1.

The  preceeding  analysis  shows that  Eqs.  (1a)–(1d) have
only  a  single  stable  fixed  point,  the  one  in  which  the
whole population consists of pure wild-type virions. The
mutant will therefore always go extinct eventually.

The rate at which the mutant disappears depends on the
m.o.i. Figure 2 shows the ratio between mutant and wild-
type concentrations as a function of passage, for various
m.o.i.  Concentrations  are  measured  with  respect  to  the
genotype,  that  is,  mutant  and  wild-type  concentrations
are Ym and Yw, respectively. In the example given, we have
γm/γw =  0.3.  At  low  m.o.i.,  the  mutant-to-wild-type  ratio
drops from 1 at passage zero to values of 10-2 and lower
after four passages. At high m.o.i., the reduction in mutant
concentration proceeds much slower. For example, at an
m.o.i. of three, the mutant-to-wild-type ratio is only 10-1
after four passages. An interesting aspect of Fig. 2 is that
the reduction in mutant frequency during the first passage
is independent of the m.o.i. This effect is a consequence of
our  assumption  that  the  mutant  has  impaired  ability  of
cell entry. In the first round of infection, when all virions
are pure wild type or pure mutant, the mutant virions can-
not benefit from phenotypic hiding. Therefore, their fre-
quency  will  decrease  corresponding  to  the  true  fitness
difference  to  the  wild  type,  independent  of  the  m.o.i.
From  the  second  passage  onward,  the  balance  between
pure and mixed virions is established, and further reduc-
tion  of  the  mutant  frequency  is  slowed  down  at  high
m.o.i.

Figure 3 shows the individual concentrations of the vari-
ous pure and mixed virions at an m.o.i. of five. We observe
that  the  concentration  of  pure  mutant  virions  decreases
much  faster  than  that  of  mixed  virions  with  mutant
genomes.  After  ten  passages  both  concentrations  are
equal, and after fifty passages, there are more than twice as
many mixed virions with mutant genomes than there are
pure mutant virions. When the mutant is rare, it is mostly
hiding  behind  wild-type  capsids,  which  slows  down  its
extinction. Interestingly, the fraction of mutant genomes
encapsidated with wild-type protein is equal to the frac-
tion of wild-type genomes encapsidated with mutant pro-

of the symmetry of equations (1b) and (1c), and disap-
pears for µ > 0.

Mutation-selection balance for positive µ
We  now  turn  to  the  general  case  of  a  positive  mutation
rate µ. We first consider the case of vanishingly low m.o.i.,
r = 0. When we set r = 0, Eq. (2) becomes the discrete-time
version of a model of maternal effects in quasispecies evo-
lution [55]. In Ref. [55], the fitness of a virion is assumed
to be the product of a contribution from the genotype of
the virion's parent and one from the virion's own geno-
type.  The  situation  here  is  simpler,  because  we  assume
that  fitness  is  only  determined  by  the  phenotype
(efficiency of cell entry). In the language of Ref. [55], this
means we have bi = 1 for all genotypes i. From Eqs. (5) and
(6) in Ref. [55], we obtain the steady-state concentrations
of  pure  and  mixed  virions  (neglecting  back  mutations
from mutant to wild type):

We mentioned in the previous section that ywm = ymw for µ
= 0. Clearly, this symmetry does not exist for µ > 0. For 0
< µ << 1, the ratio in concentration of the two classes of
mixed virions is ymw/ywm = (1 - µ - γm/γw)/µ ≈ 1/µ. There will
typically  be  several  orders  of  magnitude  more  mutant
genomes  encapsidated  in  wild-type  protein  than  wild-
type  genomes  encapsidated  in  mutant  protein.  Note,
however, that this result holds only under the assumption
of  vanishingly  low  m.o.i.  As  the  m.o.i.  increases,  the
mixed virions with mutant genomes will still be at higher
concentration  than  the  mixed  virions  with  wild-type
genomes,  but  the  ratio  between  the  two  will  be  much
smaller than 1/µ. The ratio of mixed virions with mutant
genomes to pure mutant virions is ymw/ymm ≈ 1 - γm/γw < 1
at  low  m.o.i.,  that  is,  there  are  more  pure  virions  than
mixed virions with mutant genomes in equilibrium. We
found numerically that at high m.o.i., this relationship is
reversed,  and  there  are  substantially  more  mixed  than
pure mutants.

For the total amount of mutant genomes in the popula-
tion, we obtain after summing Eqs. (5c) and (5d):

This  expression  is  equivalent  to  the  one  given  by  Ruíz-
Jarabo et al. in their analysis of quasispecies memory [44].
Equations (6) and (7) differ only in the factor 2(1 - µ) - γm/
γw. This factor is larger than one for small mutation rates,
that is, as long as

µ < (1 - γm /γw)/2. 

 (8)

If  the  mutant  has  a  substantial  fitness  disadvantage  in
comparison to the wild type (say at least 10%), then µ will
always be small enough to satisfy this condition. There-
fore, phenotypic hiding will lead to an increase in mutant
genomes even at low m.o.i. The increase is at most a factor
of two (for µ << 1 and γm/γw << 1) in comparison to the
prediction of the standard quasispecies model.

For  the  case  of  positive  mutation  rate  and  high  m.o.i.,
there  is  no  analytic  solution  available,  and  we  have  to
resort to numerical simulations. Figure 4 shows the decay
of mutant genomes over time, starting from an initial state
where mutant and wild type are present in equal concen-
trations. We have displayed trajectories for a wide range of

m.o.i., and we have also displayed the corresponding tra-
jectory generated by the standard quasispecies model. All
trajectories  show  the  same  qualitative  behavior:  The
mutant  frequency  decays  quickly  during  the  initial  pas-
sages, and then levels off in mutation-selection balance.
As  discussed  in  the  previous  paragraphs,  the  level  of
mutant genomes in mutation-selection balance is always
higher  in  our  model  than  in  the  standard  quasispecies
model. Moreover, the level of mutant genomes increases
with  increasing  m.o.i.  The  initial  decay  of  mutant
genomes is also influenced by the m.o.i., and slows down
with  increasing  m.o.i.  In  general,  the  initial  decay  of
mutant genomes for µ > 0 is identical to the one for µ = 0,
as described in the previous subsection. It is interesting to
note  that  phenotypic  hiding  influences  the  equilibrium
concentration of mutant genomes at low m.o.i., but not
the  speed  at  which  equilibrium  is  attained.  The  initial
decay of mutant genomes is identical for our model at low
m.o.i. and for the standard quasispecies model.

Discussion
Ruíz-Jarabo et al. measured the frequency of the minority
FMDV RED mutant up to passage 50, and found that the
frequency  was  still  declining  at  passage  50  [44].  They
observed mutant frequencies at passage 50 between 6.6 ×
10-4  and  10-3.  These  results  are  in  agreement  with  our
model of phenotypic hiding if we use a relative fitness of

0.4  for  the  RED  mutant  as  compared  to  the  wild  type
[42,44],  and  assume  that  (1)  the  fitness  disadvantage  is
fully explained by impaired entry, (2) the mutation rate is
µ = 10-4, and (3) the m.o.i. is approximately five (Fig. 4).
The  m.o.i.  in  Ref.  [44]  was  between  one  and  five.  Ruíz-
Jarabo et al. noted that mutant concentrations around 10-
3  would  follow  from  equilibrium  state  of  the  standard
quasispecies  model  if  the  mutation  rate  were  µ  =  10-3
rather than µ = 10-4. However, the standard quasispecies
model  predicts  that  the  mutation-selection  balance
should be reached around passage 10 (Fig. 4), which is at
odds  with  the  observation  that  the  frequency  of  RED
mutants continued to decline up to passage 50.

It  is  important  to  note  that  capsid  proteins  can  be  pro-
vided in trans during the production of infectious FMDV
particles [51], and phenotypic hiding has been known for
many years in a variety of picornaviruses [56–58]. Other
factors may enhance or reduce the effects of complemen-
tation.  For  instance,  compartimentalization  or  physical
localization  should  prevent  to  some  degree  the  free
exchange of genomes and products.

In  order  to  test  fully  the  predictions  of  our  model,  we
would  need  data  on  the  decay  of  the  mutant  frequency
from replicate populations propagated at different m.o.i.
Unfortunately,  such  data  does  not  exist.  Although  Ruíz-
Jarabo et al. propagated their populations at an m.o.i. of
0.1 in their initial study [42] and at an m.o.i. between one
and five in their follow-up study [44], we cannot compare
the  mutant  frequencies  reported  in  these  two  studies,
because  the  method  of  screening  for  RED  mutants  was
changed  in  the  follow-up  study  ([44],  Table  1,  Note  b).
Moreover, a caveat applies to the comparison of the exper-
imental data to our model: Ruíz-Jarabo et al. determined
the frequency of RED mutants by first screening for mon-
oclonal antibody (MAb SD6) resistant virions, and then
determining  the  fraction  of  RED  mutants  among  them
from sequence data. While this method successfully pre-
vents against counting MAb-resistant mutants that are not
RED, it does not measure the fraction of RED mutants that
hide behind RGD capsids. If phenotypic hiding plays an
important role in this system, then the fraction of hiding
RED  mutants  could  be  substantial,  and  the  reported
mutant  frequencies  would  likely  represent  underesti-
mates. In summary, the experimental data are consistent
with our model, but do not allow us to either accept or
reject  it  with  certainty.  We  have  shown  in  the  present
paper  that  phenotypic  hiding  can  increase  equilibrium
frequencies by factors of two to five, or even higher, for
high m.o.i. It is conceivable that other types of comple-
mentation can have similar effects [59].

Phenotypic hiding can bias fitness determinations if the
phenotype, rather than the  genotype,  is quantified. This

their 

bias occurs simply because a fraction of mutant genomes
will hide behind wild-type envelopes and will be missed,
an effect that has been previously reported [29,60]. As a
byproduct of our study, we predict two phases of mutant
frequency decay specific to phenotypic hiding. In the first
round of infection, all virions are pure wild type or pure
mutant,  so  that  the  mutant  virions  cannot  benefit  from
complementation.  Therefore, 
frequency  will
decrease corresponding to their true fitness and independ-
ently of the m.o.i. From the second passage onward, the
balance  between  pure  and  mixed  virions  is  established,
and further reduction of the mutant frequency proceeds
much slower if the m.o.i. is sufficiently high, as illustrated
in Figure 2. As a consequence, if fitness competitions are
halted after the first passage, measurements of the pheno-
type  will  not  bias  fitness  determinations.  These  effect
should not be observed in other forms of complementa-
tion, but should be characteristic of any situation in which
the phenotype is determined by envelope proteins. Host
range will often belong to this category, since receptor rec-
ognition is one of its main determinants. Other examples
include  antibody  resistant  mutants  and  escape  mutants
when the antiviral drug targets entry, such as rimantidine
and  amantidine-resistant 
influenza  strains  or  WIN
compound-resistant  picornaviruses  [61].  Thus,  pheno-
typic  hiding  can  keep  a  relatively  large  frequency  of
mutants in the absence of selective pressure that can pro-
vide  a  quick  response  when  such  selective  pressure  is
restored.

Complementation can also complicate the interpretation
of  other  experimental  results  involving  competition
between two (or more) strains. For instance, Miralles et al.
[62,63] tested the effect of clonal interference in VSV pop-
ulations by changing the population size in competitions
between  wild  type  and  a  MARM  mutant.  This  MARM
mutant carries a point mutation that confers resistance to
I1 Mab, but it is neutral otherwise [64]. Clonal interfer-
ence occurs in asexual organisms when population sizes
are large enough to allow the simultaneous generation of
more  than  one advantageous mutation, so that  the  best
mutation has to compete not only with an inferior wild
type  but  also  with  the  other  fitter  mutants  [65].  Thus,
while the best possible mutation should always be the one
becoming dominant, the rate at which it does so should
be slowed down in large populations. The VSV competi-
tion experiments were carried out at increasing viral pop-
ulation  sizes,  but  the  number  of  infected  cells  was  held
constant,  that  is,  the  m.o.i.  was  increased  alongside  the
population  size.  Therefore,  complementation  may  also
have contributed to the slowdown of the speed of adapta-
tion at large population sizes, and the relative contribu-
tions of complementation and clonal interference to the
slowdown would be hard to disentangle. The only pheno-
typic  hiding  effect  that  the  authors  could  avoid  were

related to the determination of changes in MARM C fre-
quencies, and these only correlate to the changes in bene-
ficial  mutation  frequencies  if  the  beneficial  mutation
mapped to the G glycoprotein.

Many infections in plants and animals are probably initi-
ated by one or few viral particles, thus corresponding to a
situation of low m.o.i. As replication proceeds and titers
rise, the likelyhood of coinfection increases. The best evi-
dence  for  multiple  infections  in  vivo  comes  from  the
observation of natural recombinants. In the case of HIV-
1,  for 
instance,  rampant  recombination  has  been
reported, even among different subtypes [66,67], and the
number of proviruses per cell was estimated to be approx-
imately three. Another well known example is influenza
virus,  for  which  reassortment  is  a  major  mechanism  of
evolutionary change [68]. As in the case of HIV, reassort-
ment  depends  of  coinfection,  and  once  coinfection
occurs,  complementation  is  as  likely  to  ensue  as
reassortment.

Conclusions
We  have  shown  that  phenotypic  hiding  has  substantial
influence  on  the  equilibrium  frequencies  of  mutants  in
selection-mutation  balance,  and  on  the  speed  at  which
deleterious  mutants  are  lost  from  the  population.  Our
theory  makes  five  predictions  that  can  be  tested
experimentally:

1.  The  rate  at  which  the  mutant  disappears  should
decrease and the equilibrium concentration of the mutant
should increase with increasing m.o.i.

2.  A  substantial  fraction  of  mutant  genomes  should  be
encapsidated with wild-type protein.

3. The ratio of mutant genomes encapsidated in wild-type
protein  to  wild-type  genomes  encapsidated  in  mutant
protein should decrease with increasing m.o.i.

4.  Even  at  low  m.o.i.,  the  fraction  of  mutant  present  in
mutation-selection balance should be larger (up to a fac-
tor  of  two)  than  predicted  by  the  standard  quasispecies
model if the mutant fitness is low compared to the wild-
type fitness.

5. The decrease of mutant frequency during the first pas-
sage  should  be  independent  of  the  m.o.i.,  and  equal  to
that measured for later passages at very low m.o.i.

Future experiments can be designed to test these predic-
tions, and can thereby clarify whether phenotypic hiding
is a major contributor to viral memory and elevated equi-
librium frequencies of mutants.

Methods
In this section, we present some calculations that form the
basis of the derivation of our model equations.

We first calculate the probability that a virion produced by
an n-fold coinfected cell is pure. Assume a cell is infected
by k virions with wild-type genotype, and by n - k virions
with mutant genotype. Then, the probability that an off-
spring virion is pure wild-type is the probability that it has
wild-type  genotype,  which  is  k/n,  times  the  probability
that it has wild-type phenotype, which is again k/n. Thus,
the  total  probability  is  (k/n)2.  If  we  want  to  know  the
probability that an offspring virion is pure for a number
of coinfected cells with different ratios in their multiplic-
ity of infection of wild-type and mutant genotypes, then
we have to sum over the different contributions of all the
individual  cells.  In  practice,  we  will  not  know  exactly
which cells are infected with what virions. However, it is
reasonable to assume that we know the overall probabili-
ties  with  which  cells  are  infected  with  either  mutant  or
wild-type genotype. Assume that xw is the probability that
a cell is infected with wild-type genotype, and xm = 1 - xw
likewise  for  the  mutant  genotype.  Then,  the  number  of
wild-type  genomes  k  in  a  cell  is  binomially  distributed,
and  therefore  the  overall  probability  ξww(n)  that  an  off-
spring virion from a cell infected by n virions is pure wild-
type becomes [38]

Likewise, we find for the probability ξmm(n) that an off-

spring virion is pure mutant ξmm(n) = xwxm/n + 

2
xm

.

Now we consider mixed virions. Assume again that a cell
is infected by k virions with wild-type genotype, and by n
- k virions with mutant genotype. In analogy to the con-
siderations for a pure virion, we find that the probability
of a mixed virion is k(n - k)/n2, regardless of whether the
genotype is wild-type and the phenotype is mutant or vice
versa.  The  probabilities  ξwm(n)  and  ξmw(n)  that  an  off-
spring virion is mixed of either type are then

Equations (9) and (10) are valid if all cells have exactly the
same  multiplicity  of  infection.  However,  infection  is  a
Poisson process, and some cells will end up being infected

by more virions than other cells. Assume that λ is the mul-
tiplicity of infection of the whole population. Then, the
probability that a single infected cell is infected by k viri-
ons is e-λ λk/[(1 - e-λ)k!]. The factor 1 - e-λ in the denomina-
tor corrects for the e-λ cells that will not be infected at all.
We obtain the overall probabilities to find a pure or mixed
offspring virion by summing over all possible combina-
tions of infections, with their respective probabilities. For

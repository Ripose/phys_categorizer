ABSTRACT 

The construction of algebraic structure of central molecular chirality is 

provided  starting  from  the  empirical  Fischer  projections  for  tetrahedrons.  A  matrix 

representation  is  given  and  the  algebra  of  O(4)  orthogonal  group  for  rotations  and 

inversions  is  identified.  The  result  can  be  generalized  to  chains  of  connected 

tetrahedrons.

From  the  molecular  point  of  view,  chirality  embraces  all  chemical  disciplines:  organic, 

biological,  inorganic,  organometallic  chemistry.  Asymmetry  of  atomic  configurations  is  a  basic 

feature  to  estabilish  their  chemical,  physical  and  biological  properties.  When  two  molecules  have 

identical structural formulae, but they are not superimposable,1 they are termed enantiomers, even 

called  optical  antipodes,  since  they  rotate  the  polarization  plane  of  light  in  opposite  directions. 

Chiral  molecules  having  central  chirality  contain  stereogenic  or  asymmetric  centers.2  When  two 

molecules with identical constitution, possessing more than one stereogenic center, do not show a 

mirror-image relation to each other, they are called diastereoisomers. 

Other forms of chirality are generated when the rotation around double bonds is prevented as in 

allenes3  or  is  limited  due  to  steric  hindrance  as  in  biphenyls4:  in  these  cases  we  are  dealing  with 

Chirality can be even due to a helical shape of the molecule which can be left- or right handed in 

axial chirality. 

orientation.5 

In  the  last  decades,  discrete  mathematics  and  qualitative  descriptions  of  the  spatial  features  of 

molecules  have  provided  a  large  development  of  theoretical  stereochemistry.6  The  aim  of  these 

studies is related to the achievement of formal approaches to stereochemical issues of classification. 

Molecular chirality has been studied by algebraic methods based on permutation group theory and 

group representation theory,7 providing general insight into chirality properties. It can be asserted, 

with no doubt,  that the most important three dimensional structure in chemistry is the tetrahedron 

and  chiral  tetrahedral  molecules  are  not  only  the  most  familiar  to  the  organic  chemist  but  largely 

widespread compounds. 

An  extremely  useful  method  to  represent  tetrahedral  molecules  was  reported  in  1891  by  Emil 

Fischer,1a who proposed the well-known planar projection formulae. When describing a molecule in 

this  representation,  some  rules  have  to  be  followed  (Fig.  1):  the  atoms  pointing  sideways  must 

project  forward  in  the  model,  while  those  pointing  up  and  down  in  the  projection  must  extend 

toward the rear. As an example, let us take into account the (S)-(+)-lactic acid.

In order to obtain proper results using Fischer projections, they must be treated differently from 

models in testing superimposability. Projections may not be rotated of 90°, while a 180° rotation is 

allowed.  The  interchange  of  any  two  groups  results  in  the  conversion  of  an  enantiomer  into  its 

mirror image (Fig. 2).

From  now  on,  let  us  indicate  the  chemical  groups  by  numbers  running  from  1  to  4.  For  the 

example which we are considering: OH=1, CO2H=2, H=3, CH3=4, without taking into account the 

effective priorities of the groups. 

There are 24 (=4! the number of permutations of 4 ligands among 4 sites) projections. Twelve of 

these correspond to the (+) enantiomer and are illustrated in Fig. 3.

The  permutations  shown  in  Fig.  3  can  be  obtained,  either  by  permuting  groups  in threes  or by 

turning the projections by 180°. The permutations drawn in Fig. 4 derive by those in Fig. 3 simply 

by the interchange of two groups. With these considerations in mind, it is immediate asking for an 

algebraic  structure  which  can  be  built  from  Fischer  projections  and  this  is  the  aim  of  the  present 

article. 

ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURE OF CENTRAL MOLECULAR CHIRALITY 

In another report,8 we  described a tetrahedral  molecule by  a projection on a {x,y} plane where 

the molecule center coincided with the origin of the axes. 

The approach, based on complex numbers, is a straightforward way to represent the “length” of the 

bond  with  respect  to  the  stereogenic  center  and  the  “angular  position”  with  respect  to  the  other 

bonds. In general, given a tetrahedral molecule with a stereogenic center, we can always project it 

on a plane containing the stereogenic center. 

Every bond, in the plane {x,y}, can be given in polar representation by 

θρ=Ψ

                                                                  (1) 

where 

jρ  is  the  “modulus”,  i.e.  the  projected  length  of  the  bond, 

jθ  is  the  “anomaly”,  i.e.  the 

position of the bond with respect to the x, y axes (and then with respect to the other bonds) having 

chosen  a  rotation  versus.  The  number 

1-

  is  the  imaginary  unit.  A  molecule  with  one 

i =

stereogenic center is then given by the sum vector

in any symmetry plane. 

In  order  to  reduce  the  Fischer  rules  to  an  algebraic  structure,  let  us  define  the  central  chirality 

operator 

kχ   acting  on  a  tetrahedral  molecule.  From  now  on,  we  shall  take  into  account  only  one 

tetrahedron,  but  the  generalization  of  the  following  results  to  simply  connected  chains  of 

tetrahedrons is straight as we shall see below. 

A tetrahedral molecule can be assigned by a column vector Μ , rewriting Eq. (2) as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                                (3) 

The 

jΨ  are defined as in Eq. [1]. 

The corresponding Fischer projection is

which is the first in Fig. 3. The position of the bonds in the column vector (3) are assigned starting 

from the left and proceeding clockwise in the Fischer projection. 

The matrix representation of the projection (1) is assumed as “fundamental”, i.e., 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                  (4) 

so the action on the column vector Μ  is 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                                    (5) 

1χ  is nothing else but the identity operator. The configuration (2) of Fig. 3 can be achieved as soon 

as we define an operator 

2χ  acting as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2χ

                                                   (6) 

which corresponds to the matrix 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

                                               (7) 

it is clear that 

2χ  yields a permutation on the bonds 

jΨ . In the specific case, it is a rotation. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  configuration  (1)  of  the  (−)  enantiomer  can  be  obtained  starting  from  the 

column vector (4), if we define an operator 

1χ  which acts as

By this approach, we can obtain all the 24 projections (12 for the (+) enantiomer and 12 for the (−) 

enantiomer represented in Figs. 3 and 4) by matrix operators acting on the fundamental projection 

(1). The following tables summarize the situation. The operators 

kχ give rise to the representations 

of the (+) enantiomer, while the operators

The  matrices  in  Table  I  and  II  are  the  elements  of  a  4-parameter  algebra.  Those  in  Table  I  are  a 

representation of rotations, while those in table II are inversions. Both sets constitute the group O(4) 

The matrices in Table I are the remarkable subgroup SO(4) of 4× 4 matrices with determinant +1. 

The  matrices  in  Table  II  have  determinant  1− ,  being  inversions  (or  reflections).  They  do  not 

constitute a group since the product of any two of them has determinant  1+ . This fact means that 

the product of two inversions generates a rotation (this is obvious by inverting both the couples of 

bonds in a tetrahedron). In fact, we have

rotation, while the product of a reflection and a rotation is again a reflection. In any case, the total

The  24  matrices  in  Table  I  and  II  are  not  all  independent.  They  can  be  grouped  as  different 

representations  of  the  same  operators.  To  this  aim,  we  make  use  of  a  fundamental  theorem  of 

algebra which states that all matrices, representing the same operator, have the same characteristic 

polynomial.10 In other words, the characteristic equation of a matrix is invariant under vector base 

changes. In (+) enantiomer case, the characteristic eigenvalue equation is

GENERALIZATION TO MOLECULES WITH N STEREOGENIC CENTERS 

The results of the previous section can be extended to more general cases. 

For a molecule with n stereogenic centers, we can define n planes of projection. The bonds among 

the centers have to be taken into account. If a molecule with one center has four bonds, a molecule 

with two centers has seven bonds and so on. The general rule is 

 

=n centers      ⇔

 bonds                              (26) 

assuming  simply  connected  tetrahedrons.  When  atoms  act  as  “spacers”  between  tetrahedral  chiral 

centers,  the  number  of  bonds  changes  from 

1

  to  4n.  A  molecule  with  n  stereogenic  centers, 

3 +n

starting from Eq. [2], is then given by the sum vector

any k. The couple

Chirality emerges when two molecules with identical structural formulae, as shown algebraically in 

the  previous  section,  are  not  superimposable.  After  a  rotation,  two  bonds  result  superimposable, 

while the other two are inverted. 

On the contrary, if after rotation and superimposition, the molecules are identical, the situation is 

achiral. Such a treatment can be repeated for any projective symmetry plane which can be defined 

for  the  n  centers.  The  possible  results  are  that the molecule is fully invariant after rotation(s) and 

superimposition with respect to its mirror image (achiral); the molecule is partially invariant after 

rotation(s)  and  superimposition,  i.e.  some  tetrahedrons  are  superimposable  while  others  are  not 

(diastereoisomers); the molecule presents an inversion for each stereogenic center (enantiomers). 

Also for these general cases, the considerations of previous section can be applied. Let us write 

Eq. [27] as

where 

kM   and 

kM   are  generic  tetrahedrons  on  which  are  acting  the  operators 

k
lχ   and 

k

respectively; k is the center index running from 1 to n; l is the operator index ranging from 1 to 12.

In other words, 

kM  and 

kM  are the result of the application of one of the above matrix operators on 

the starting column vector 

(0)M k . 

A particular discussion deserves the index p. Its range is 

p ≤≤0

It is the number of permutations (at most one for any center) which occur when the operators 

k
lχ  act 

on tetrahedrons. It corresponds to the number of reflections occuring in a n-center tetrahedral chain. 

No inversions, but rotations occur when 

k
lχ  operators act on the molecule. With this rule in mind, it 

follows that

chirality structure. 

SUMMARY 

In  this  paper,  the  algebraic  structure  of  central  molecular  chirality,  starting  from  the  well-known 

empirical  Fischer  rules,  was  deduced.  The  operators  of  such  an  algebra  are  obtained  from  the  24 

projections  which  a  single  tetrahedron  can  generate  in  S  and  R  configurations.  They  constitute  a 

matrix representation of O(4) orthogonal group of dimension 6. Twelve of them are rotations, while 

the other twelve are inversions, as can be derived from the value of their determinant, which is 1 for 

rotations  and  –1  for  inversions.  It  is  useful  to  remember  that  all  the  projections  are  algebraically 

generated starting from a fundamental one where the positions of chemical groups are established a 

priori in a clockwise sequence 1→2→3→4. 

The  generalization  to  chains  of  tetrahedrons  is  straightforward  leading  to  the  distinction  among 

achiral  molecules,  diastereoisomers  and  enantiomers.  These  classes  of  molecules  can  be 

parametrized  by  the  chirality  index 

},{ pn=χ

,  geometrically  deduced  in  a  previous  report.8  The 

number  n  enumerates  stereogenic  centers;  p  indicates  the  inversions  occuring  when  some  of  the 

tetrahedrons of a given molecule cannot be superimposed to their mirror image after rotation. 

Finally,  the  rule  holds  only  for  simply  connected  chains  of  tetrahedrons  (and  eventually  when 

“spacer” atoms are placed between bonds).

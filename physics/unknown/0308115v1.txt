Abstract 
This paper is an attempt for arguing the possibility for short time “when, where” and “how” 
Earthquakes prediction.  
The local “when” Earthquake prediction is based on the connection between geomagnetic “quakes” 
and the next incoming minimum or maximum of tidal gravitational potential. The probability time 
window for the predicted earthquake is +/-1 day for the minimum and +/-2 days for the maximum. 
The preliminary statistic estimation on the basis of distribution of the time difference between 
predicted and occurred earthquake for the period 2001-2002 in Balkan, Black Sea region is given.  
Examples for posteriori earthquakes “when” predictions at different World regions, using archive 
Intermagnet local data, are given. 
The possibility for local “when, where” Earthquake prediction is based on the accurate, with special 
space and time scales, monitoring of the electromagnetic field under, on and over Earth surface. The 
periodically upgraded information from Seismic hazard maps is essential. 
The possibility for local “when, where and how” Earthquake prediction is based on the monitoring 
of geomagnetic field, electro-potential distribution in the Earth crust and atmosphere, spatial and 
time distribution of Earth surface radiation, gravitational anomalyties map, season and day 
independent temperature depth distribution, water sources parameters (debit, temperature, chemical 
composition, radioactivity), gas emissions, ionosphere condition parameters, Earth radiation belt 
parameters, Sun wind, Seismic hazard maps information for crust parameters (strain, deformation, 
displacement) and biological precursors. 
 
Introduction 

The “when, where and how” earthquake prediction is not solved problem [1-9].  
The more precision space and time set for Earth’s crust condition parameters and the 

including in the monitoring the electromagnetic fields measurements under, on and over Earth 
surface, the temperature distribution and other possible precursors can be useful for research of the 
“When, where and how” earthquake’s prediction [10-22]. The progress in this direction partly is 
summarized in [9-22]. The approach is based on the understanding that earthquake processes are 
part of very complex and without adequate physical model of Earth existence and the gravitational 
and electromagnetic interactions, which en sure the stability of Sun system and its Planets for long 
time. The earthquake part of the model can be recovered in the infinity way “theory- experiment- 
theory” using nonlinear inverse problem methods for looking the correlations between fields in 
dynamically space and time scales.  

The achievements of tidal potential modeling of Earth surface with included ocean and 

atmosphere tidal influences is essential part of the system.  

The today almost real time technologies GIS for archiving, visualization, analysis and 

interpretation of the data and non- linear inverse problem methods for building theoretical models 
for the parameter behaviors, correlations and dynamics have to be used. 
Multiple component correlation analysis and the nonlinear inverse problem digital and analytical 
methods in the frame work of fluids dynamics and Maxwell theory have to be crucial for the 
building step by step the adequate physical model. 

The role of geomagnetic variations as precursor can be explained by the hypothesis that in 
the time of earthquakes preparing, with grows of strain, deformation or displacement in the Earth 
depth in some interval of density changing, arises the chemical phase shift which leads to an 

2 

electrical charge shift. The arrived new system of alternating electrical currents with periods in 
minute scales is the origin of magnetic field, which contribution to the geomagnetic field is 
geomagnetic “quake”. The K-index can not indicate the local geomagnetic variation, because of the 
hour scale calculation. Nevertheless, the K- index behavior in the near space has to be analyzed. 
The second moment of magnetic field, calculated for minute time scale, can indicate a bigger, than 
usual, variations for seconds and minutes scales. If the field vector components are measuring many 
times per second, one can calculate the frequency dependence of full geomagnetic intensity and to 
analyze the frequency spectrum of geomagnetic quake. If the variations are bigger for some time, 
than usual, one can say that we have the geomagnetic quake - the earthquake precursor. The 
probability time window for the predicted earthquake (event, events) is approximately +/-1 day for 
the minimum and +/-2 days for the maximum of Earth tidal potential behavior.  

The future epicenter coordinates can be estimated on the basis of geomagnetic vector 
measuring at last in three points and with the inverse problem methods, applied for estimation the 
coordinate of the volume, where the phase shift arrived and its time window.  

In the case of  incoming big earthquake (Magnitude > 5 - 6) the changes of vertical 
electropotential distribution, the Earth temperature, the infrared Earth radiation, the behavior of 
water sources, its chemistry and radioactivity, the atmosphere conditions (earthquakes clouds, etc.), 
the charge density of Earth radiation belt have to be dramatically changed in and over epicenter 
area.  

The achievements of tidal potential modeling of Earth surface with included ocean and 

atmosphere tidal influences, many component correlation analysis and nonlinear inverse problem 
methods in fluids dynamics and electrodynamics are crucial for every step of building the 
mathematical and physical models.  

The today real time communication and geographical information system for archiving, 

visualization, analysis, and interpretation of data and free Internet publication is essential part of the 
system, which will permit the including in the science group new scientists with different interests. 

In  Part  1  are  given  the  2002  statistics  estimations  for  the  reliability  of  the  time  window 
earthquake prediction on the basis of geomagnetic field measurements and Earth tidal behavior [25] 
for Balkan, Black Sea region [17]. 

In Part 2 the  posteriori analysis of the approach is  applied for  Alaska region 2002 Mag 8.2 

earthquake and Hokkaido, 2003. 

In Part 3 the list of monitoring parameters, which can be useful, the theoretical apparatus for 

analysis and technology for data acquisition are described shortly 
 
Part 1.The geomagnetic  field quake likes a time window  earthquake’s precursor for Balkan, 
Black Sea region 

It is useful to stress that the author’s interests to the earthquake’s prediction problem arrived 
as a  result of complex research of the Black Sea ecosystem some 15 years ago [23]. In the time of 
gathering the historical data for the ecosystem arrived the facts for the Crime earthquake in 1928, 
which  should  be  interpreted  as  electromagnetic  and  earthquake  correlations. The Russian scientist 
academician  Popov  proposed  such  hypnotizes  in  the  early  30-th  of  20-th  century-  private 
communication.  

Toward  Intermagnet  requirements  for  measuring  the  geomagnetic  field  (see Figure 1)  on 
Earth surface [30], the accuracy is ±10 nT for 95% of reported data and ±5 nT for definitive data, 
with one sample per 5 seconds, in the case of Vector magnetometer (F(XYZ) or F(HDZ)) and 1 nT, 
with 3 samples per second, for Scalar Magnetometer (F).

The geomagnetic vector projection H is measured with accuracy less or equal to1 nT  (know- 
how of JINR, Dubna, Boris Vasiliev) with 2.4 samples per second. Because of technical reason the 
sensor  was  oriented  under  the  Horizon  in  such  manner  that  the  measured  value  of  Hi  is around 
20000 nT. See Figures 1 and 2.

After some time (from 1999 to 2001) of looking for correlations between the behavior of the 
geomagnetic field, Earth tidal gravitational potential and the occurred earthquakes one turn out that 
,  which  we  denote  by  Sig  (D Sig), is playing the role of 
the daily averaged value of 
earthquake precursor.

for near future earthquake. One has to be sure there are not a cosmos or Sun wind reasons for the 
geomagnetic quake. So, for example, see the sites [27-29].

The preliminary Fourier analysis of 

mH data give that the bigger geomagnetic variations are 
cased from the arriving for hours time period a new frequencies with periods from 10-th of seconds 
till 10 minutes and with very specific amplitude behavior. Such new specter arriving for hour time 
is invisible for minute samples measuring.  
 

The probability time window of the incoming event or events is defined by the next date of 
the Earth tidal potential extremum with tolerance +/-1 day in the case of minimum and +/-2 days in 
the case of maximum. See Figure 6.  

 
 
The uncertainty problem of distinguishing the predicted event (or group of events – 
aftershocks) from the events which occurred in the region in the predicted time window is solved 
with new earthquake function SChtM:

The sense of function SChtM is a density distribution of earthquake’s Magnitude. In the point 
of measurement  SChtM is logarithmically proportional to the energy influence of the earthquakes. It 
is important to stress out that the first consideration of the Magnitude and distance dependences was 
obtained  on  the  basis  of  nonlinear  inverse  problem  methods.  Obviously,  the  nearer  and  biggest 
earthquake (relatively biggest value of SChtM) will bear more electropotential variations, which will 
generate  more  power  geomagnetic  quake.  At  this  stage  of  the  researching  the  measure  of  daily 
geomagnetic state can serve the averaged for 24 hours (1440 minutes) values of standard deviations:

The simple and usually working criteria for evidence of geomagnetic quake is when Sig 

increase for two consecutive days i, i+1 and the difference between the values of Sig is bigger 
than the mean arithmetic sum of their errors DSig:

Sigi+1 – Sigi  > (DSigi + DSig i+1)/2 , Sigi+1 > Sigi

If  criteria  (2)  are  fulfilled  and  there  are  not  a  cosmos  and  Sun  generated  variations  of 
geomagnetic field, one can say that the geomagnetic quake had a place. Such quake is unique 
precursor for incoming earthquake and in the next minimum or maximum of the local Tidal 
gravitational potential somewhere in the region this predicted earthquake will occur.  
For some of the cases, the criteria (3) have to be calculated for hour or ten’s of minute’s time 
scale. 

The  signal  for  earthquakes  with  different  epicenters  we  have  in  the  case  when  the 
specific behavior of  field  and  its  standard  deviation  occur  more  than  one  time  at  different 
hours of the day. 

The analysis of the precursor function Sig on the basis of special kind 5 points digital 

derivatives can serve in the future for creating the algorithm for automated alert system.  

 
Obviously, the more detailed time window can be achieved with analyze of daily variations 

of tidal potential, calculated every hour.

At this stage of research all earthquakes have the same  SChtM for different definitions of the 
Magnitude. After developing on the basis of inverse nonlinear problem the mathematical models of 
empirical and theoretical dependences between incoming earthquake processes, magnetic quake and 
parameters  of  earthquake  we  will  arrive  to  a  set  of  SChtM  functions  in  correspondence  with  the 
different definition of Magnitude. The volumes, its depth, chemical and geological structures of the 
region have to be included in the dependences.

It is interesting to stress that in the case of big earthquake with Mag > 6, in more than 60 % 
of  the  cases,  after  the  earthquake  there  are  very  little  variations,  compared  with  usual  daily 
behavior, of the magnetic field with different time duration: from 10 minute to some hours. Those 
influences do not depend on the distances, but one can see  the differences, which depend on the 
zone of earthquake: convergence or divergence one. See for example next Figure 7.

In Figure 10 the distributions of the difference between times of predicted and occurred

10 

growth of the distribution without widening and its approximation the Gauss distribution in time is 
argument that the correlation geomagnetic signal- Tidal potential extremum and occurred 
earthquake has a physical causality origin. The number of earthquakes, analyzed in Figure 10 is 
greater than the predictions of the events. The obvious reason is that in the case of some 
earthquakes with greater Magnitude there were aftershocks 

On the next Figure 11 the reader can see that at distance 200 km the geomagnetic quake can 

stay as an earthquake precursor for earthquakes with Magnitude > 2.5.  Obviously, in greater 
distances the predicted events will have greater Magnitude.  The today estimation is that big 
earthquakes (Magnitude >5) could be predicted till distances 500- 600 km.   

 

 
At the next Figure 12, for completeness, is represented the Magnitude distribution of 

predicted events.

The  independent  control  (In  the  framework  of  Strasbourg  recommendations  about 
earthquake  prediction  of  the  European  Union  for  ethical  and  public  security  reasons)  of  the  time 
window  earthquake  prediction  reliability  was  organized  in  the  framework  of  the  Bulgarian 
Academy of Sciences, its Geophysical Institute and a set of colleagues, which are interested  in the 
research topic [16- 17], starting from January 2002. 

Summarizing, one can tell that for the analyzed period  have occurred 69 events. For 59 of 
them the time window was successfully predicted. For 4 of occurred events the precursor quake was 
not  established  by  the  everyday  analysis  and  6  events  were  not  predicted  because  of  hardware 
problem. 

The above results for successful and reliability time window earthquake prediction can be 
considerate  as  a  fist  step  for  solution  of  “when,  where  and  how”  earthquake  prediction  at  level 
“when”.  Because  of  absence  the  adequate  physical  model  of  the  correlation  and  theoretical 
estimation of the measured experimental values the possibility that the earthquake with magnitude 
greater  than  2.5  are  occurring  very  scare  in  the  region  to  fulfill  the  established  correlation  is  not 
closed. 

The first  prove,  that  in  the  framework  of  such  complex  approach,  the  “when,  where  and 
how” earthquake prediction problem can be solve will be the “when, where” prediction on the basis 
of at least 3 point electromagnetic real time monitoring. If the statistic estimation will be successful 
for a long time period and the established correlations will be confirmed from the adequate physical 
model solutions, one could say the earthquake prediction problem is under solving.

It is seen that there are more signals

effect.

Part 3. Proposal for creating of Short Time Earthquake prediction local NETWORK  

We will not discuss the long time prognostic system for estimation of earthquake risk. They 

are well known [32, 32]. 

The aim of this Proposal is to create a system for research the reliability of the local forecast 
system for earthquakes in the interval Mag > 2.6- 3 and radius till 600 km. The system is complex 
and  the  attended  practical  result  will  be a short time  “when, where” eq’s prediction. The “when, 
where and how” problem will be solved step by step in the building an adequate physical theoretical 
model  for  the  Earth  magnetism.  The new  type  of  science  unification  has  to  be  realized  for  such 
complex research. The system includes experimental, theoretical and technological parts:  
Experimental data for:  
Geomagnetic  field,  Electro-potential  distribution  in  the  Earth  crust  and  atmosphere,  Temperature 
Earth  crust  distribution,  Crust  parameters  (strain,  deformation,  displacement),  Gravitational 
anomaly  map,  Season  and  day  independent  depth  temperature  distribution,  Water  sources 
parameters  (debit,  temperature,  chemical  composition,  radioactivity),  Gas  emissions,  Ionosphere 
condition parameters, Infrared radiation of  Earth surface, earthquake clouds, Earth radiation belt, 
Sun wind, Biological precursors.  
Theory:  The  achievements  of  tidal  potential  modeling  of  Earth  surface  with  included  ocean  and 
atmosphere  tidal  influences,  many  component  correlation  analyses,  Nonlinear  inverse  problem 
methods in fluids dynamics and Maxwell equations are crucial. 
Technologies:  GIS  for  archiving,  analysis,  visualization  and  interpretation  of  the  data  and  non- 
linear  inverse  problem  methods  for  building  theoretical  models  for  the  parameter  behaviors, 
correlations and dynamics. 

The  set  of  the  devices  has  to  be  in  correspondence  with  known  data  for  earthquakes  risk 
zone 
(strain,  deformation, 
(gravitational  anomalyties  and  Crust  parameters  monitoring 
displacement). The geomagnetic device set distance has to be in order of 150 – 200 km, the electro- 
potential  100-  200  km  in  dependence  of  geological  today  situation  and  its  history.  The  set  for 
monitoring of the daily and season crust temperatures has to be in order 300 km. The correlations 
with Sun wind influence have to be in real time.  

The system has to be created step by step. The condition for next step pass has to be the 
building of  physically clear new theoretical correlations or dynamical models and, of course, the 
successful: “when”, “when, where” or “when, where and how” earthquake prediction. 

In conclusion in Figure 18 is represented the number of world earthquake’s with Magnitude 
greater then 4. The correlation between the eq’s number, global warming and consequent increasing 
the Sea level and the amplitude of Ocean tides is going to be obvious. 

Lyric digression:  The total slime of Burgas bay bottom at 1996 accidentally coincide with 

the jump of eq’s number. 

 
Conclusion 
The correlations between local geomagnetic quake and incoming earthquakes, which occur 
in  the  time  window  defined  from  the  next  minimum  (+/-  1  day)  or  maximum  (+/-2  days)  of  the 
Earth  Tidal  gravitational  potential  is  tested  statistically.  The  distribution  of  the  time  difference 
between predicted and occurred events is a Gauss one and is increase in the time. 

The hypothesis for possible physical model is proposed.

This result can be interpreted like a possible first reliable approach for solving the “when” 

earthquakes prediction problem. 

On  the  basis  of  electromagnetic  monitoring  under,  on  and  over  Earth  surface  is  proposed 
research  for  solution  of  “when,  where”  earthquake  prediction  problem.  Under  the  hypothesis  the 
current  has  a  big  vertical  component  the  data  of  two  geomagnetic  vector  devices  are  enough  for 
determination  of  the  future  epicenter.  The  three  devices  will  permit  to  research  the  correlation 
between  Earth  surface  distribution  of  precursor  function  Sig  and  the  Magnitude  of  the  incoming 
earthquake. 

The  complex  monitoring  for  solving  the  “when,  where  and  how”  earthquake  prediction 

problem is very shortly discussed.

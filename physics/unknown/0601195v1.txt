Abstract 
We propose a detail theoretical approach modeling molecular librations in liquid investigated by 
ultrafast optically heterodyne detected optical Kerr effect (OHD-OKE). The approach has been 
applied for fluoroform (CHF3) molecular liquid and new information about spectrum, relaxation 
time and time domain librations has been obtained. 
 
Introduction 

Ultrafast  dynamics  and  interaction  of  molecules  in  a  liquid  phase  are  subjects  of 
numerous investigations. In particular it is due to the increased interest in molecular mechanisms 
determining  very  sophisticated  biological  processes  such  as  ferment  reactions,  matrix 
biosynthesis and others1. Interaction of a molecule with its nearest neighbors in a liquid leads to 
molecular librations in the local potentials formed by these interactions 2. Typical time period of 
a molecular translational jump between the two different potentials is about 10-8-10-10 s at room 
temperature. Orientational molecular diffusion has a shorter time period: 10-10-10-12s. Therefore, 
experimental investigation of librational dynamics requires the technique, which is able to detect 
nonstationary signal with temporal duration not bigger than 100 fs. One of the coherent ultrafast 
laser spectroscopy methods, which can detect such a temporal librational response, is based on 
the  using  of  nonlinear  optical  Kerr  effect  with  optically  heterodyne  detection  (OHD-OKE)3. 
Interpretation of the OHD-OKE experiments requires theoretical treatment of a fast third-order 
nonlinear optical response.  

At the present stage the theoretical description of the optical nonlinear response in liquid 
remains a subject of topical researches 4-11. The ultrafast laser pulses cover a broad range of the 
low-frequency  transitions  and  give  raise  the  different  Raman  active  molecular  motions,  which 
can not be longer described as simple two-level systems. First general theoretical analysis of the 
fast nonlinear molecular response on the action of the femtosecond laser fields was given in the 
works of Tanimura and Mukamel, who proposed path-integral techniques in Liouville space12, 13. 
Unfortunately the problem of molecular dynamics in a liquid investigated by high-order optical 
response  complicates  an  application  of  such  theories  to  analysis  of  experimental  data.  These 
difficulties  lead  the  interpretations  of  OHD-OKE  experimental  data14-18  are  based  on  the 
phenomenological  models19-27  and  using  of  the  Fourier-transform  method  that  separates  the 
nuclear and non-resonant electronic contributions in the total nonlinear-optical transient response 
28.  These  investigations  demonstrate  that  the  OHD-OKE  signal  shows  a  significant  deviation 
from single exponential decay of the rotational molecular response, which typically corresponds 
to the coherent librational response24, 29 at time delays smaller than 1 ps.  
Traditionally  the  phenomenological  description  of  the  nonstationary  librational  signal  uses 
models of overdamped and underdamped oscillators 22, 23, 30-32 which assume an influence of fast 
fluctuation  forces  described  by  a  friction  constant  in  the  models.  The  models  imply  that  the 
fluctuations  are  much  faster  than  the  molecular  oscillations  having  period  about  tens 
femtosecond.  In  particular  the  interpretation  of  carbon  disulfide  CS2  rotational  molecular 
dynamics  within  the  framework  of  these  models  gives  the  irreversible  time  of  librational 
response, which is about ten times shorter than the oscillational periods24, 30, 31 and thus the result 
does not rather correspond to a real physical picture of the molecular librations. In this work we 
propose  an  enriched  phenomenological  librational  model  by  introducing  an  initially  unknown 
distribution  function  of  librational  frequencies  which,  as  we  show  below,  can  be  easily  found 
from the  numerical analysis  of  the  OHD-OKE data. We demonstrate that the fast decay of the 

coherent librations can be described in such model with a high accuracy without introducing the 
overly  fast  irreversible  relaxation  processes.  With  a  purpose  of  the  complete  analysis  of  the 
OHD-OKE experiment data we also briefly analyze the responses of the intramolecular motions 
and the orientational diffusion without using Fourier-transform method. In the final part of this 
paper we apply the proposed approach for analysis of the fluoroform (CHF3) OHD-OKE signal 
investigated  by  Laurent  et.  al.33  and  this  analysis  have  allowed  us  to  obtain  the  frequency 
distribution function, amplitude and relaxation time period of the coherent librations. 
 
Modeling the OHD-OKE signal  
We  consider  a  traditional  OHD-OKE  experimental  schema  with  a  two  pulse  excitation  of  the 
medium.3, 23 The first intensive pump pulse Epy excites nonstationary anisotropy polarizability of 
a liquid probed by the second weak pulse Eo with the time delay τ. Let us assume that the electric 
field Epy of the first light pulse is polarized along y-axis (see Fig.1)

probe  pulse  polarization  by  the  nonstationary  anisotropy  medium  modulates  the  probe  pulse 
intensity in the output of crossed polarizators. The signal/noise ratio is considerably improved by 
using such optically heterodyne technique.23,  34,  35 A heterodyne signal is formed in the mixing 
process  of  the  probe  pulse  with  the  local  oscillator  field  Elo  polarized  perpendicularly  to  the 
probe field polarization with additional 90o phase shift:

Eqs. (5), (6), (7) and (10) describe the temporal behavior of the OHD-OKE signal through the 
function 
, which contains librational, orientational diffusive and intramolecular oscillation 
responses  in  the  molecular  liquid.  A  detail  theoretical  treatment  of  the  molecular  responses  is 
given below.  
 
Intramolecular oscillations 
We describe the intramolecular  nuclear  oscillation  response
 using Eq. (10). Note that the 
interaction energy of a molecule with the pump pulse is less than kT in traditional conditions of 
the  OHD-OKE  experiments.  Therefore  it  is  possible  to  ignore  weak  correlations  between  the 
rotational  and  intramolecular  motions  and  to  find  the  following  response  for  intramolecular 
oscillations:

The  pump  pulse  excites  most  effectively  Raman  active  oscillation  modes  having  the  period, 
which are comparable or larger than the pump pulse duration. Therefore the typical OHD-OKE 
experiment  signal  contains  as  a  rule  the  coherent  oscillation  of  “heavy”  molecular  fragments. 
Usually  the  excitations  of  coherent  proton  oscillations  in  molecules  are  not  realized  in  typical 
OHD-OKE experiments, while slower oscillations of benzol ring and –OH, -CH3, -Cl fragments 
can be detected with the pulse duration about 100 fs.14,  37 In large molecules with the different 
masses of the fragments, a number of slow oscillating modes give contributions to the signal. It 
should be noted here that one can overcomes identification problem of the oscillation modes in 
the total OHD-OKE signal in particularly by an using of multi-pulse variants of the pumping in 
the OHD-OKE technique.38  
 
Orientational diffusion  
Laser  pulses  excite  coherent  rotational  motions  of  molecules  with  anisotropy  polarizability 
0≠∆α ).  Using  Eq.  (10)  and  taking  into  account 
∆
  we  ignore  the  weak  terms 
(
( )tδα   while  modeling  orientational  rotation.  Frenkel’s  theory2  includes  two 
types  of  molecular  rotations  in  liquid:  librations  and  orientational  diffusion.  Orientational 
diffusion takes place due to rotational jumps between different equilibrium orientational angles 
of  molecules.  For  small  jump  angles 
  this  motion  is  modeled  by 
<<
the orientational diffusive equation2, 39. Experimental data14, 23, 37 demonstrates that the relaxation 
time  of  orientational  diffusion  τd  is  tens  or  hundreds  times  as  longer  as  the  relaxation  time  of 
librations. Using Eq. (10) we describe orientational diffusion through the following function of

,  D=1/(6τd)  is  a  diffusive  coefficient,  τd  is  average  time  of  a 
molecular orientational jump. The typical time of the orientational diffusive response is equal to 
several picoseconds for simple molecules23 like CS2 and increases by tens picoseconds for more 
complicated  molecules  like  acetophenone  and  its  derivatives.14  The  temporal  response  of 
orientational diffusion 
 has picosecond exponential decay after pump pulse excitation. This 
response  gives  long  decay  “tails”  in  OHD-OKE  signals  corresponding  to  extended  or  flat 
molecules. 
 
Molecular librations  
We  consider  librations  of  molecules  allocated  in  the  different  local  potentials  determining  the 
librational  frequencies.  A  variety  of  the  locally  realized  potentials  leads  to  the  spectral 
broadening  of  the  librational  frequencies  (having  width  about  50  cm-1  for  acetonitrile40).  We 
model  the  librations  of  a  molecular  ensemble  using  one-particle  distribution  function

According  to  Eq.  (28)  the  librational  response  depends  on  the  distribution  function 
 
characterizing  inhomogeneous  broadening  of  molecular  liquid  librations. The  spectral shape of 
the  function 
  can  be  obtained  from  the  experimental  OHD-OKE  signal  with  the  use  of 
Eq.(28). Below we present such analysis for fluoroform molecule CHF3.  
 
СHF3  molecular librations  
The fluoroform (CHF3) is a polar molecule having the axial symmetry polarizability tensor and 
relatively large dipole moment. Recently Laurent et.al.33 have reported fast OHD-OKE signal of 
molecule CHF3 presented in Fig. 2. In this figure we also present molecular contributions in the 
total experimental signal:

are  presented  in  Table  1.  The  dash-dot  line  on  Fig.2  demonstrates  the  inertial  nature  of  the 
librational response: a signal reaches its maximum at time delay about  100 fs and then decays 
completely after about 500 fs. We have numerically modeled librational response using Eq. (28) 
and found that the function 
 

 is close to the distribution function of Maxwell type

correspond  to  the  real  irreversible  relaxation  processes  in  the  molecular  liquids.  The  observed

Discussion and conclusion 

the 

local 

Time  domain  optical  spectroscopy  investigations  of  the  liquid  molecular  dynamics 
demonstrate rotational molecular responses with ultrafast relaxation time is less than 1 ps. These 
responses  show  inertial  character  and  are  often  referred  to  collision-  or  interaction-induced 
molecular motions40, 41 realized as the collective molecular librations in the local potentials22, 42. 
Mechanisms  of  the  OHD-OKE-signal  decay  are  determined  both  by  the  manifold  molecular 
motions  and  by 
liquids.  There  are  several 
phenomenological  models22,  23,  30-32  describing  the  coherent  librations  but  mechanisms  of 
ultrafast  relaxation  are  not  clear  yet.  The  traditionally  used  phenomenological  models  of  the 
overdamped and underdamped oscillators can not be physically correct for the modeling of the 
data obtained in the OHD-OKE experiments33 since the fluctuations of the local intermolecular 
potentials can not be much faster than the intramolecular oscillation periods which are about tens 
or hundreds femtoseconds and they are comparable with librational relaxation times14, 21-23, 35, 37. 
Thus the influence of such spatially homogeneous fluctuations hardly corresponds to irreversible 
decay of the observable coherent librations in the OHD-OKE experiments.

in 

In  this  paper  we  have  developed  a  theoretical  approach  and  demonstrated  that  ultrafast 
decay processes of librational response can be described by a fast decoherence (dephasing) due 
to  their  huge  inhomogeneous  spectral  broadening 
  of  the  molecular  librations.  We 
describe  theoretically  the  total  molecular  OHD-OKE  response,  which  contains  the  signals  of 
intramolecular  oscillations  (16),  orientational  diffusion  (18)  and  librational  motion  (28).  The 
response  function 
  of  the  coherent  librations  has  been  obtained  in  a  general  form

We note that the spectral distribution

librational  distribution  function  by  the  numerically  calculation  of  OHD-OKE  response  in  the 
studied in the studied molecular (CHF3) liquid. We have found that the fluoroform librations are 
characterized by the distribution function 
 which shape at room temperature is close to 
the  Maxwell  distribution  (29)  demonstrating  a  three-dimensional  nature  of  spatial  local 
 cm-1 determines the 
inhomogeneity of the medium. Spectral width of the destribution 
time  decay  of  the  coherent  librations  (about  500  fs),  which  is  less  than  the  average  time  of 
molecular  diffusive  jumps  between  nearest  local  potentials  (0.8  ps).  Our  estimations  of  the 
librational  amplitude  indicate  that  deviation  angle  of  the  fluoroform  molecule  from  the 
equilibrium state is less than 10o and the molecular librations are close to the harmonic character.

 is determined directly by the intermolecular 
interactions,  therefore  the  distribution  should  be  sensitive  to  the  thermodynamic  parameters  of 
the  medium29,  43.  Knowledge  of  the  spectral  distributions 
  is  important  for  more  deep 
insight  into  the  molecular  dynamics  of  similar  molecular  liquids.  In  particular,  recently  it  has 
been reported that the fast part of OHD-OKE response in acetonitrile CH3CN decreases twice at 
the temperature range from 8 to 75 C44. To our opinion, such strong OHD-OKE signal sensitivity

purpose  of  detail  investigation  of  the  distribution  function (

. The reason is that two pump pulses excite fifth-order optical response11-13,  45, which is 
sensitive  to  the  dephasing  mechanisms  of  the  induced  nuclear  motions.  We  expect  that  the 
Raman  echo  motion  type  of  the  librational  response  can  be  observed  by  the  third  probe  pulse 
which  would  make  it  possible  to  detail  examine  the  molecular  dephasing  and  irreversible 
relaxation processes in femto- and picosecond time domain.

Abstract:  The observed higher uplift rates before the end of deglaciation requires the 
existence of a low viscosity channel or layer.  The uplifts observed after the end of 
deglaciation does not show any contribution from this low viscosity channel and a 
homogeneous viscosity model fits very well to the observed uplift.  Most of the 
researchers therefore prefer the homogeneous model and suggest that the higher uplift 
rate before the end of deglaciation is the result of elastic contamination.  It has been 
shown that the elastic deformation of the lithosphere is far too small to be responsible for 
the observed extra uplift; therefore, the homogeneous viscosity model should be 
discredited. 
  The homogeneous viscosity of the postglacial period and the high uplift rate of the late 
glacial period can be explained with a model which has an upper layer determining the 
homogeneous viscosity and the layer below it which has a low viscosity.  The 
contribution to the uplift of this low viscosity layer is indistinguishable from an 
instantaneous uplift.

lithosphere, which is consistent with this model.  The viscosity of the low velocity zone 
should be between10
.  The lower constrain on the viscosity of the low 
velocity zone can be deduced from seismic observations.  This viscosity model is 
consistent with post glacial rebounds and further supported by the lack of the dynamic 
topography.

1. Introduction 
 
In 1865, T.F. Jamieson recognized and reported evidence that the uplifted beaches of 
Fennoscandia were the result of the removal of the ice sheet.  Similar movements of the 
North American crust were reported by Bell in 1896 and by Gilbert in 1897.  They 
concluded that warmer weather melted a great amount of ice on the earth’s surface, 
causing huge mass redistribution.  The lithosphere responded to this mass redistribution 
with deformation, which can be characterized by time-altitude graphs, where the altitude 
is compared to the eustatic sea-level.  Previous investigations (Andrews, 1968; Farrand, 
1962; Schofield, 1964) identified the following characteristic features of the uplift curves: 
- there was a rapid, 5-10 (or even higher) cm/year uplift, which started in each area 
soon after the deglaciation; 
- during this fast initial uplift period, the uplift developed independently from the 
general uplift of the overall area; 
- the rate of uplift sharply decreased at a given locality immediately following the 
deglaciation of that locality; 
- after the completion of the deglaciation, the subsequent uplift developed in 
harmony with the general uplift and the rate of the uplift can be characterized with a 
simple exponential decrease. 

  These identified features of the uplifts are independent of the locality, although the 
curves are displaced in time, and this displacement correlates with the time of 
deglaciation of each locality.  The time of deglaciation divides the uplifts into two 
distinguishable parts.  In the first part the uplift rate is fast and independent from the 
general uplift, while in the second part the uplift rate is much slower, and can be 
characterized by an exponential decrease.  Based on these significantly different uplift 
characteristics Walcott (1972) even suggested different names for these periods.  For the 
North American Uplift he suggested that the uplift for the period 18,000-6,500 B.P. 
(before present) should be called late glacial, while the uplift from 6,500 to the present 
shall be named as postglacial. 
  The higher uplift rate in the late glacial period requires a low viscosity layer or

 Pas (Anderson, 1967; Artushkov, 1971; 

channel with a viscosity of 10
Fjeldskaar, 1994; Walcott, 1973).  The presence of a low viscosity layer is supported by 
geological and seismological observations, which favors a very week asthenosphere, and 
by the observed relative submergence around the regions of the postglacial rebounds 
(Walcott, 1972).  The uplift of the postglacial period can be explained with a 
21

homogenous average viscosity of 10  Pas (Haskell, 1935; Mitrovica, 1996; Peltier, 
1976).  The excellence fit between the homogeneous viscosity models and the observed 
uplift curves excludes the possibility of a low viscosity zone.  The proposed viscosity 
models are either able to explain the late glacial or postglacial period but not both.  The 
debate between the two different interpretations of the postglacial rebounds has not been 

 

2

settled (Fjeldskaar, 2000; Lambeck, 2000) and comprehensive model has not been 
proposed. 
 
2.  The uncertainty of the viscosity 
  The low viscosity layer and the homogeneous viscosity models are mutually 
exclusive; therefore, if either of these models is correct then the other one has to be 
discredited.  Researcher promoting homogeneous viscosity model claim that the 
extremely good fit between the model and the uplift, observed during the postglacial 
period, excludes the possibility of a low viscosity zone. 
  Any two independent set of data of the time-altitude observations allows one to 
calculate the viscosity for the time period elapsed.  The uncertainty of these calculated 
viscosities gives information on the homogeneity of the viscosity.  If the uncertainty 
)2( σ
is high then the homogeneous viscosity model is not supported, while a low 

uncertainty would support the model.  The viscosities were calculated form the best 
documented uplift observed at the mouth of the Angerman river in Sweden (Linden, 
1938).  There is a general agreement (Mitrovica, 1997) that the uplift process can be 
characterized by a simple exponential decay process for the region in which isostatic 
equilibrium was reached.  The Angerman river area satisfies this condition, since it is 
located in the middle of the Fennoscandian uplift.  One of the simplest formula, 
developed for half infinite homogeneous viscous substratum (Heiskanen, 1958; Meinesz, 
1937) is

equation two into one, the two unknowns, relaxation time, and remaining uplift can be 
calculated from any two independent sets of observations.  Using the data of Angerman 
river the average of the remaining uplift is 46 m, while the average of the relaxation time 
is 5319 years for the period between 7944 and 87 years before present (Fig. 1).  These 
values are in good agreement with previous studies (Mitrovica, 1996).

wavelength of the uplift.  For the Fennoscandian uplift the following values were used: 
Rτ
The calculated average viscosity under the Fennoscandian area is 0.88x1021 Pas (Fig 1).  
The uncertainty of the calculated viscosity is 0.21x1021 Pas.  This relatively small 
uncertainty indicates that a homogeneous model can fully explain the observed uplift for 
the postglacial period from 7944 to 87 BP years and that the possible contribution of a 
low viscosity layer to the uplift can be excluded.  This also means that the low viscosity 
models should be discredited. 
 
3.  The size of the elastic rebound 
  The homogeneous viscosity model consistent with the uplift observed in the 
postglacial period but can not explain the observed fast uplift during the late glacial 
period.  Researchers promoting these models interpret the higher uplift rate during the 
late glacial period as the result of the elastic deformation of the lithosphere (Mitrovica, 
1996).  The size of the elastic deformation of the lithosphere will be considered in details. 
  Assuming a homogeneous viscosity and using previously determined relaxation time 
the total uplift for the entire time period can be calculated.  Using the most conservative 
approach, assuming that the full load was released immediately at the beginning of the 
deglaciation, the total uplift is 255.2 m.  The least conservative approach would be to 
assume that the ice was melted at the end of the late glacial period which would result an 
uplift of 203.7m.  The difference between these calculated uplifts and the observed 
maximum uplift is 100-150m.  Thus the expected elastic deformation for the 
Fennoscandian region should be between 100 m. and 150 m (Fig. 2). 
  When a load from the surface is released the lithosphere undergoes two kinds of 
elastic deformations, thickening and unbending.  From these two kinds of deformation 
only the thickening can occur instantaneously, since the unbending is controlled by the 
plastic deformation of the mantle (Fig. 3).  In calculating the elastic deformation, the

 is the pressure release caused by the melted ice, z is the thickness of the 

lithosphere, E is the Young’s modulus, and 
ν  is the Poisson’s ratio.  For simplicity, the 
load is infinite in the horizontal extent, and the sides of the loaded column are restrained 
by hydrostatic pressure, in which case the elongation in the horizontal plane will be 
negligible.  If the lithosphere is in isostatic equilibrium then the stress release on the 
surface will not have an affect on the stress of the mantle; therefore, the thickness of the 
thickening layer is equivalent with the thickness of the lithosphere.  The stress in the 
mantle will decrease in accordance with the uplift of the lithosphere.  For the calculation, 

the following values were used:

km; E = 
  The resulting thickening of the lithosphere, which should be observed on the surface 
from the stress release caused by the melting of 2 km thick ice sheet, is about 18 m.  This 
value is far less than the observed access deformation of 100-150 m.  The elastic 
deformation of the lithosphere can not be responsible for the extra uplift of the late 
glacial period; therefore, the homogeneous viscosity models should be discredited. 
 
4.  Proposed viscosity model  
  The only solution able to satisfy both the late glacial and postglacial uplifts is a 

viscosity model in which the viscosity of the upper later is 10
below this layer is significantly lower.  This proposed viscosity for the upper layer is 
consistent with current GPS deformation measurements which indicate that the 

while the viscosity

lithosphere has an average viscosity of 10  Pas (Flesch et al., 2000). 
  The low viscosity layer under the lithosphere allows the unbending of the lithosphere 
very quickly.  This fast deformation in geological scale is practically indistinguishable 
from elastic deformation.  Seismic observations can constrain the lower limit of the 
viscosity of the asthenosphere.  Using one second for the Maxwell relaxation time and 
100 GPa for the elastic modulus, the lowest viscosity value for the low velocity zone

Pas for the lithosphere, can fully explain the observed uplift of postglacial rebounds 
at any sites.  Additionally, the very low viscosity layer is consistent with the lack of the 
dynamic topography.  Based on the currently accepted viscosity models, the mantle flow 
in the asthenosphere should maintain a much larger dynamic topography, which is not 
observed.  This is a major unexplained problem in geophysics (Wheeler, 2000).  If the 
viscosity directly below the lithosphere is decreased by several orders of magnitude the 
amplitude of the dynamic topography on the surface of the Earth is reduced, but only by 

 

5

~20% (Lithgow-Bertolloni, 1997).  A more dramatic decrease in the viscosity of the low 
viscosity layer might explain the complete lack of the dynamic topography. 
 
5.  The rigidity of the lithosphere 
  There is one argument that might be raised against the very low viscosity of the 
asthenosphere.  The rigidity of the lithosphere based on previous investigations seems to 
be too small (Brochie, 1969) to explain the observed flexure (Morner, 1980).  There are 
uncertainties in these previous investigations, like the distribution of the ice load is 
unknown.  If the ice load had a close to a parabolic distribution (Brochie and Silvester, 
1969) instead of a uniform one then the crustal deflection becomes very close to the 
observed uplift of the Fennoscandian area. 
  Rupture of the crust can also reduce the flexure of the lithosphere by reducing the 
wavelength of the uplift.  Whole crustal rupturing, related to the postglacial rebound, has 
been reported recently (Arvidson, 1996). 
 
entire area is in isostatic equilibrium and the lithosphere supports the unbalanced load 
within its rigidity limit then the elastic deformation of the lithosphere should be reduced 
greatly. 
  Superimposing these previous affects, parabolic load distribution, rupture of the crust, 
and isostatic equilibrium for the entire uplift area, can result a lithospheric flexure which 
is consistent with the observed ones. 

Isostatic pressure from the bottom of the lithosphere compensates the ice load.  If the

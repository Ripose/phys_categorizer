Abstract:  Short-baseline calculations reveal that if the neutrino were massive, it

would show a beautifully structured spectrum in the energy difference between
storage ring and detector; however, this spectrum seems beyond current
experimental reach.  An interval-timing paradigm would not seem feasible in a
short-baseline experiment; however, interval timing on an Earth-Moon long
baseline experiment might be able to improve current upper limits on the neutrino
mass.

Introduction

After the Kamiokande and IMB proton-decay detectors unexpectedly recorded
neutrinos (probably electron antineutrinos) arriving from the 1987A supernova, a
plethora of papers issued on how to use this happy event to estimate the mass of the
neutrino.   Many of the estimates based on these data put an upper limit on the
mass of the electron neutrino of perhaps 10  eV c2  [1].

When Super-Kamiokande and other instruments confirmed the apparent deficit

in electron neutrinos from the Sun, and when a deficit in atmospheric muon-
neutrinos likewise was observed, this prompted the extension of the kaon-oscillation
theory to neutrinos, culminating in a flavor-oscillation theory based by analogy on
the CKM quark mixing matrix.  The oscillation theory was sensitive enough to
provide evidence of a neutrino mass, even given the low statistics available at the
largest instruments.

J. M. Williams                  Neutrino Mass Without Oscillations (2001-02-19)                                              2

However, there is reason to doubt that the CKM analysis validly can be applied

physically over the long, nonvirtual propagation distances of neutrinos [2].

The relatively high luminosity of a muon storage ring as a neutrino factory raises

the question of a possible alternative estimate of the neutrino mass, based on the
kind of kinematic analysis attempted with the SN1987A supernova data.   We
present here some preliminary calculations describing how this estimate might be
made.

Both muon and electron neutrinos are produced by such storage rings, and we do

not rule out a difference in massiveness between the two types.  If mass could be
confirmed in either of the suggested paradigms, adjustment  of the circulating-muon
polarization (which would vary the electron neutrino flux [12; 13]) would allow the
mass difference to be estimated.

The nonoscillating approaches discussed here require noncontinuous neutrino
production, corresponding to a storage ring with a circulating train of muons at any
instant filling only part of the ring, or to a storage ring with shuntable barrel [3].

Problem Overview

Geometry Considerations

We first sketch a generalization of the muon storage ring as an oval, ignoring the
alternative shapes under consideration, bowtie (e. g., [3; 7]) or triangle (e. g., [4; 7]),
as not bearing on the experiment we propose.

variables used for neutrino mass analysis in the text.   The direction of x
is on the line between barrel and detector; y is transverse.

As in Fig. 1, assume a storage ring of circumference C and a straight run R of fixed
length  X

Y x R = 1 cm and g= 500 , will be about 5 meters to the right of its O.   The virtual
origin, of course, will traverse the barrel with its respective bunch.

Timing Considerations

Now we look at some of the temporal factors.   We call a muon train a bunch of

muons or a succession of such bunches so closely spaced that neutrinos from
adjacent bunches in the train can not be discriminated in a single pass at the
detector.   Call  Lm  the lab-frame length of this train.  Call TR  the lab-frame time
spent by the train while any part of it was in the barrel.   We wish to optimize time
for the detector to distinguish events from different trains, so we assume just one
train in the storage ring.

We may write the value of TR  as a function of barrel length as,

Looking at Table 1, to perform this experiment without shunting or interrupting

the stored muons, discrimination at the detector of neutrino events separated by
perhaps 1 ms  in the lab frame is required to verify the occurrence of a train.

In the following, we refer to lab times t during which at least part of the muon

train is in the barrel as "the t TR

Exploratory Calculations

We look at the magnitude of the problem before attempting an experimental

protocol.

Coarse Estimate of Muon Luminosity Decay

We calculate the effect of the decay of the muons stored in the barrel on the

expected neutrino population, to account for it and evaluate it as a possible
systematic error.

The Lorentz factor g for a 50 GeV muon with rest mass 106  MeV c2  is given by,

 m, or, about 21 cm.

Over a 5 km propagation distance (below) on the light cone,  21 cm represents a
factor of g@ 110 ; at the anticipated energies, the rest mass of a particle at g= 110
would exceed that of a muon.   This means that the effect of muon decay in the
barrel on  x  is far greater than the effect of any reasonable uncertainty in the mass

of the neutrino.   The decay in the barrel then will require a major systematic
correction if our measurement is to succeed.

Fine Estimate of Muon Luminosity Decay

Looking at Fig. 1, assuming continuously refreshed circulating muons until

reaching the barrel, the corresponding rate of good-neutrino creation events will rise
linearly while the train enters the barrel, will be distributed almost uniformly on
the 1 2  km domain of the barrel while the train is fully contained in the barrel, and
will decline linearly again as the train exits the barrel.   Thus, given a barrel

Muons will not be refreshed during any of these phases, suggesting a greater effect

To find the change in mean because of muon decay in the barrel, we superpose

phases and map them back to the barrel centroid:

For 50 GeV muons, we now find that muon decay has shifted the mean neutrino

mean.

We note that our new estimate of the effect of muon decay in the 500 m barrel has
made the coarse luminosity decay estimate ca. Eq. (4) worse.   It is discouraging that
an experiment depending on the mean neutrino creation point in the barrel merely
might provide an uncertainty complementary to that known of the lifetime of the
muon, but we shall proceed anyway.

On the bright side, mass of the neutrino should not complicate use of a muon

storage ring to refine measurement of the decay time of muons.

Mass Measurement Paradigms

There are two distinct paradigms that might be used to detect and measure the
mass of the neutrino:  (a) A spectral difference method; and, (b) an absolute time of
flight method.

General Assumptions

The two paradigms below imply that calibration will be performed in air to keep
systematic errors down.   This requires the distance from storage ring to detector to
be under about 5 km, a reasonable line-of-sight limit.   Extension of the

computations below to detectors at 5,000 km distance or more, is straightforward,
because the distance enters as a simple extrapolation factor in all formulae.
However, in the author's opinion, the effect of matter on the propagation speed of
Standard-Model neutrinos is as big a question as their mass.

Temporal resolution at the detector may be defined spatially, recalling that the
neutrinos will be ultrarelativistic and that c maps to about 1 3  meter per nanoscond,
or 1 3  millimeter per picosecond.   The possibility of liquid argon time-projection
chambers with wire spacing on the order of a few millimeters [8] or of dense CCD
vertex reconstruction to a few microns [11] suggests that picosecond final-event
resolution, and thus nanosecond time-difference resolution, might be attained fairly
easily.

To estimate feasibility, we assume a detector system capable of fully

reconstructing 107  events per year per kg mass [8].   We assume that the energy of
each neutrino, for a good detector event, will be correct within 20%:  For a 50 GeV
neutrino, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle then allows a time resolution down
. as).  We guess that the system will provide a time
to 
resolution to 1 ns.   We assume some 1010  good events per year [8; 11]; for each of
these events, we assume data correlated with other detector or storage-ring events
as required by the paradigm under discussion.

Spectral Differential Time Paradigm

In this case, we consider a number of  detector events (images of barrel events)
each characterized by a known distribution in time.   Perhaps such an event would
be synchronized to the arrival in the barrel of a train of stored muons.   We look at
the detector sample shape of the image spectrum, hoping to see a systematic
departure from that at the barrel.   If there was an increase in variance, or a change
in shape, it would indicate dispersion during flight, differential speed among the
individual particles, and therefore nonzero mass.

We assume the muon population in the storage ring is being refreshed on each
storage-ring cycle, to replace all decayed muons.   We also assume, with little loss of
generality, that the storage ring puts the barrel in use exactly half of each cycle
(50% duty cycle at the detector); this corresponds to the schedule in the third row of
Table 1, which means a muon train 250 m long in a 1500 m ring with 500 m barrel.

As in Fig. 1.1 of [8], we have a 50 GeV muon storage ring and a 1 g short-
baseline detector at a distance  D x = 5 km.   So, our good neutrino events each will
have a fairly symmetrical, bell-shaped energy spectrum centered a little over 25
GeV.  For the present exploratory purpose, we shall read [8], Fig. 1.1, as describing
a Gaussian spectrum with mean  E = 27 GeV and standard deviation

GeV.   Whenever we evaluate this spectrum, we shall cut it off at 1

this leaves about 3 standard deviations on each side of the mean and ignores the
lowest-energy neutrinos, which may escape the detector anyway.

We shall abbreviate a Gaussian function of this kind as

E

As we vary  x R  in (14), the value of E also must be changed to keep  xD  constant;

however, any  $E  in the spectrum yields a valid  $x D  for every valid  x R .   Also, E
remains the same between every image point  x D  and its barrel point  xR .   So, for
any point in the barrel, to obtain the image spectrum  Y

R , we need only use (14) to substitute for x in an expression for 

D  from the barrel spectrum
(
R x E,

)

.

Although the shape of the spectrum in the barrel is very close to constant, its
intensity changes with the phase of the storage ring.   From here on, when referring
to the geometry of the storage-ring barrel itself, the neutrino event-count spectrum
will be denoted  Y

B  covers 750 m.

R  covers 500 m; {

As ca. (5) and (6) above, the barrel and its image may be treated in three

segments, rising, uniform, and falling, each including a correction for muon decay in
the barrel.   In the barrel, or on the light cone to the detector, we have the event

for  S

  As a minor detail, recall that the barrel spectrum interval {

}x B  is fixed by the
t TR
 regime at 750 m long; it maps to the detector as an image approximately on
D x
<
D x 750 m .   Neutrinos can not propagate faster than light, so the image
xD
spectrum is bounded above by something less than  D x + 750 m, and below by about
the same something less than  D x .   The neutrino speed will be much greater than
that of the 50 GeV muons, guaranteeing the neutrino g> > 500 .  The lab-frame
difference at either end of the image at  D x = 5 km  would be about 1 cm at g= 500 ;
so, we shall ignore all this in our calculations and treat the barrel and image
domains as equal.

We wish to calculate the difference spectrum, 

(
B x E,

simplification,

neutrino mass.  The astronomical amplification factor of 1021  suggests a statistical
test will be hopeless, but we try anyway.

Clearly,

Fig. 5 obviously is not zero.  The question is, how big a statistical sample of good
neutrino events would we need to use it to prove the mass of a 10  eV c2  neutrino?

Let us assume we will be satisfied to detect mass while risking an error at

 < .001.   Naively, we shall attempt to answer the

statistical significance level  p 
question of mass by a chi-square ( c2 ) analysis.

Accepting a 20% energy accuracy at the detector, we begin by partitioning the
energy domain into mutually exclusive categories:  Starting at the high end of 50
GeV, we use  E
we can expect in the direction of the structure in Fig. 5; so, we shall pool all
distances x on the image to reduce variance within each category.

Conclusion

This paradigm appears inapplicable to high-energy neutrinos.   Other tests based

on, say, cross-correlation might use the available variance better than chi-square,
but it appears that they would not come close to revealing neutrino mass under the
differential time paradigm.   The spectral shape difference at 5 km would seem to be
too minuscule to be useful.

Absolute Time Paradigm

In this case, laser calibration or other computation of the speed of light would be

used to establish the distance along the light cone from the barrel to the detector.
The arrival or exit time in the barrel of a train of muons then would mark the start

time of an absolute time-of flight measurement of the speed of the neutrinos.  If a
sample mean of the corresponding detector events should be shown to have arrived
at the detector at the speed of light, the neutrinos would be shown massless.

We put aside for now the obvious problem of determining the locus of creation of
an individual neutrino and merely calculate some rough limits on the usefulness of
this paradigm:

The calculations already have been done above, and the relevant result is in Eq.

(9):  Expanding around the small rest-energy term, we may  plot the required
resolution for a rather heavy 10 eV c2 neutrino:

Figure 6.   The point-event detector time resolution required in Eq. (9)
to estimate the mass of a 10 eV 2c  neutrino.   Note that the vertical
scale is in attoseconds (10 18-

s).

The neutrino problem seems hopeless in this paradigm, too.   The uncertainty
principle would begin to dominate experimental error at the shorter distances and
the higher energies shown in Fig. 6, even were there no random or systematic error
at all.

From Fig. 6, picosecond time resolution at the detector would not save the day
even at  D x = 5,000 km, because a 10  eV c2  neutrino still would require a million
years at 1010  good events per year.   It would take a Mighty Murine, indeed, to apply
this paradigm at a  practical distance such as that of the planet Pluto!

A fantastic barrel-plus-detector system capable of resolving a time difference

down to a single wavelength of visible light at, say, 600 nanometers, would
correspond to a time resolution of  600 10
ps .  In Fig. 6, at 5
km, for a rather heavy 10  eV c2  neutrino, this would imply a sample size of about
N = 108 , or, a tally of some 1016  good events.   Another million-year study, even

assuming that such a time-resolution was feasible.

However, a similar experiment with one-wavelength resolution carried out at
Earth-Moon distance would reduce the required event count by  N ~ 105 .  We no
longer would have a short-baseline experiment, but this setup would seem to render
credible a meaningful improvement on the current upper bound of the neutrino
mass.

Looking at a more massive particle for comparison, Fig. 7 shows that the same
Fig. 6 calculation for a particle as heavy as a muon, at a line-of-sight range up to 5
km and at nanosecond time resolution, would require only a handful of events to
prove it massive.   Even at rather coarse  ms  time resolution, squeezing off a sample
of a few times 106  good events would be enough to estimate this mass to within a
factor of two.

muon.   The time scale is in microseconds.

Conclusion

Counter-intuitively, the absolute-time paradigm comes closer to feasibility than

the differential-time paradigm.   Seemingly, though, to make the absolute-time
paradigm practical for ~25 GeV neutrinos, one would have to improve the precision
of measurement on a short-baseline interval by some 9 to 12 orders of magnitude
beyond that reasonably attainable.

An Earth-Moon baseline would seem to be in the realm of the possible; radiation
hazards of course would be avoided entirely if the storage ring were located on the
Moon.

The sensitivity of the absolute-time paradigm depends on neutrino speed or time-

of-flight measurement.   Because a change in energy is equivalent to a squared
change in speed, 12 orders of magnitude of speed improvement at 25 GeV would
imply 0.025 MeV neutrinos.   It is unclear how an equivalent beam of ~1010  good
events per year could be accomplished for 25 KeV neutrinos at a distance of ~5 km.
It would be interesting to know whether the presently proposed muon storage ring,
or apparatus associated with it, could be designed or operated for these energies.

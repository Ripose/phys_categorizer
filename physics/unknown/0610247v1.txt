Abstract.  In  string  theory,  even  when  there  are  ten  to  the  thousand  power  vacuum  states,  does  inflation  produce 
overwhelmingly  one  preferred  type  of  vacuum  state?  We  respond  affirmatively  to  questions  whether  existence  of 
graviton  production  is  confirmable  using  present  detector  methodology.  We  use  an  explicit  Randall-Sundrum  brane-
world  effective  potential  as  congruent  with  an  inflationary  quadratic  potential  start.  This  occurs  after  Bogomolnyi 
inequality eliminates need for ad hoc assumption of axion wall mass high temperature related disappearing. Graviton 
production  has  explicit  links  with  a  five-dimensional  brane-world  negative  cosmological  constant  and  a  four-
dimensional positive valued cosmological constant, whose temperature dependence permits an early universe graviton 
production  activity  burst.  We  show  how  di  quarks,  wave  functions,  and  various  forms  tie  into  the  Wheeler-De  Witt 
equation. This permits investigating a discretized quantum bounce and a possible link to the initial phases of present 
universe’s  evolution  with  a  prior  universe’s  collapse  to  the  bounce  point—the  initial  starting  point  to  inflationary 
expansion.  This  opens  a  possibility  of  realistically  investigating  gravitons  as  part  of  a  space  propulsion  system  and 
dealing with problems from a beam of gravity waves, which would create a g-force because the geodestic structure is 
near field. It can be applied to existing and to new space propulsion concepts.  

Keywords: branes, axion walls, Bogomolnyi inequality, four- and five-dimensional cosmological constant.

INTRODUCTION 

To consider spin-two graviton detection in early universe conditions and brane-world generation of a large number 
of gravitons, we answer, affirmatively, Freeman Dyson’s challenge to prove that it is feasible to ascertain criteria for 
the existence of gravitons where their likelihood of detection is so low in most astrophysical processes (Rothman 
and Boughn, 2006). Further, we present a different paradigm about the origins of dark energy—from the stand point 
of di quarks and an application of the Bogomolnyi inequality—so we can tie a model of baryogenesis into a collapse 
of an originally axion ‘wall’ dominated potential system to the Guth (1981) inflation quadratic potential. This relies 
upon  an  analytical  connection  (Park,  Kim,  and  Tamarayan,  2006)  between  a  four-dimensional  cosmological 
‘constant’ that we would expect from more normal 3+1 standard space-time metrics, to the admittedly quite unusual 
negative five-dimensional cosmological constant present in Randall-Sundrum brane-world models. 

Data  suggesting  that  the  four-dimensional  version  of  the  “cosmological  constant”  in  fact  varies  with  background 
temperature. If temperature varies significantly during early universe baryogenesis, there would be a huge release of 
1000
 
spin-two  gravitons  in  early  cosmic  nucleation  of  a  new  universe.  To  answer  whether  “Even  if  there  are 
vacuum  states  produced  by  string  theory,  then  does  inflation  produces  overwhelmingly  one  preferred  type  of 
vacuum states over the other possible types of vacuum states (Guth, 2006)?” leads to a way to calculate the order of 
the  electroweak  phase  transition,  which  may  indeed  fix  a  preferred  vacuum  state.  This  permits  comparatively 
straightforward  data  collection  of  dark  energy  traces  in  the  early  universe  by  the  JDEM  satellite  system,  among 
other considerations. This is consistent with a flat space overlap of four- and five-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert least 
action integrals, which are the same value in ‘empty space’ but which diverge in magnitude (Loup, 2006) in non-
empty energy-matter metric space time conditions. We begin by explicit calculations (Krauss, and Trodden, 1999) 
of the electroweak phase transition order via:

To  incorporate  more  accurate  reading  of  phase  evolution  and  the  minimum  requirements  of  phase  evolution 
behavior in a potential system permitting baryogenesis, imply using a Sundrum fifth-dimension. The fifth-dimension 
 , a circle map which is written, with  R  as 
of the Randall-Sundrum brane-world (Sundrum, 2005) is, for  π θ π
the  radius  of  the  compact  dimension 5x   Circle  maps  were  first  proposed  to  model  a  free-spinning  wheel  weakly 
coupled by a spring to a motor. Circle map equations also describe a simplified model of the phase-locked loop in 
electronics.We use a circle map simply for a compact higher dimensional structure geometry, which is important in 
early  universe  geometries.  A  closed  string  can  wind  around  a  periodic  dimension  an  integral  number  of  times. 
Similar to the Kaluza-Klein case they contribute a momentum, as p = w R (w=0, 1, 2,...). The crucial difference is 
that this reverses with respect to the radius of the compact dimension, R. As the compact dimension becomes very 
small, these winding modes become very light! We write our fifth dimension (Sundrum, 2005) as:

Our embedded in four dimensions potential structure is modeled via the following phase transition listed in Eqn. (4). 
We  refer  to  a  scalar  field  using  four-dimensional  space-time,  which  we  call  φ% ,  and  which  leads  to  the  potential

formula can be found by setting the escape velocity to the speed of light; furthermore, where mass
, m is the 
mass of the gravitating object. And as a final note, we have that a soliton is a self-reinforcing solitary wave caused 
by a delicate balance between nonlinear and dispersive effects in the medium. Solitons are found in many physical 
phenomena, as they arise as the solutions of a widespread class of weakly nonlinear dispersive partial differential 
equations describing physical systems. Here, we can visualize solitons as wave forms (Beckwith, 2006b) with the 
following properties:  

m M<<

P

1.  They represent waves of permanent form;  
2.  They are localized, i.e., decay or approach a constant at infinity;  
3.  They can interact with other solitons but emerge from collision unchanged apart from a phase shift.  

We  assign  to  a  soliton-anti  soliton  pair  (S-S’)  equivalence  to  di  quarks.  As  a  convention,  we  define  constituent 
masses for di quarks as the sum of the respective quark masses, while di quarks are a combination of quarks in the 
⊗ = ⊕ . Their most attractive linkage as to new inflation physics models is as cooper pairs of 
color antitriplet  3
color superconductivity, which permits simplification of SUSY model physics. Briefly, we assign a bosonic counter 
part    to  each fermion,  which  can  be  seen  in  the  assignment  of  a  counter  part  to  a quark,  a  so  called  squark.  This 
procedure is greatly aided in the di quark model, which simplifies matters immensely.

RANDALL SUNDRUM EFFECTIVE POTENTIAL  

The  consequences  of  the  fifth-dimension,  considered  in  Eqn. (5),  show  up  in  a  simple  warped  compactification 
involving two branes: a Planck world brane, and an IR brane (Sundrum, 2005). The Planck brane; the brane where 
gravity is localized, is a four-dimensional structure defining the standard model universe. The IR brane is used as 
structure to facilitate solving five-dimensional Einstein equations. In quantum field theory physics, a graviton is a 
hypothetical  elementary  particle  mediating  the  force  of  gravity.  A  graviton,  if  it  exists,  must  be  massless  as  the 
gravitational  force  has  unlimited  range  and  must  have  a  spin  of  2  as  gravity  is  a  second-rank  tensor  field.  In  the 
brane-world  context,  gravitons  pose  serious  theoretical  difficulties.  At  high  energies,  i.e.,  processes  with  energies 
close  or  above  the  Planck  scale,  because  of  infinities  arising  due  to  quantum  effects,  a  gravitation  is  non-
renormalizable. In string theory, gravitons, as are all other particles, are states of strings rather than point particles. 
Hence,  the  infinities  do  not  appear,  while  the  low-energy  behavior  can  still  be  approximated  by  a  quantum  field 
theory  of  point  particles.  The  high  concentration  of  gravitons  near  the  localized  Planck  brane  leads  to  a  natural 
solution to the hierarchy problem in a universe with two branes. For the particular geometry that solves Einstein's 
equations, when we go out some distance in an extra dimension, we see an exponentially suppressed gravitational 
force. This is remarkable because it means that a huge separation of mass scales—sixteen orders of magnitude—can 
result from a relatively modest separation of branes. If we are living on the second brane (not the Planck brane), we 
would find that gravity was very weak. Such a moderate distance between branes is not difficult to achieve and is 
many  orders  of  magnitude  smaller  than  that  necessary  for  the  large-extra-dimensions  scenario  just  discussed.  A 
localized graviton plus a second brane separated from the brane on which the standard model of particle physics is 
housed provides a natural solution to the hierarchy problem—the problem of why gravity is so incredibly weak. The 
strength  of  gravity  depends  on  location,  and  away  from  the  Planck  brane  it  is  exponentially  suppressed.  We  can 
think  of  the  brane  geometry,  in  particular  the  IR  brane  as  equivalent  to  a  needed  symmetry  to  solve  a  set  of 
equations. This construction permits (assuming K is a constant picked to fit brane-world requirements):

To build the Kaluza–Klein theory, one picks an invariant metric on the circle S1 that is the fiber of the U(1)-bundle 
of  electromagnetism.  In  this  discussion,  an  invariant  metric  is  simply  one  that  is  invariant  under  rotations  of  the 
circle.  We  are  using  a  variant  of  that  construction  via  Eqn. (8).  Note  that  In  1926,  Oskar  Klein  proposed  that  the 
fourth spatial dimension is curled up in a circle of very small radius, so that a particle moving a short distance along 
that axis would return to where it began. The distance a particle can travel before reaching its initial position is said 
to be the size of the dimension. This extra dimension is a compact set, and the phenomenon of having a space-time 
with compact dimensions is referred to as compactification. In modern geometry, the extra fifth dimension can be 
understood to be the circle group U(1), as electromagnetism can essentially be formulated as a gauge theory on a 
fiber  bundle,  the  circle  bundle,  with  gauge  group  U(1).  Once  this  geometrical  interpretation  is  understood,  it  is 
relatively straightforward to replace U(1) by a general Lie group. 

Now, when we are looking at an addition of a second scalar term (Beckwith, 2006b) of opposite sign, but of equal 
magnitude, where:

Briefly, in classical  mechanics we derive equations of motion by the principle of stationary action. In contrast, in 
quantum mechanics, the amplitudes of all possible motions are added in a path integral. However, if the action is 
replaced by the effective action, we derive equations of motion for the vacuum expectation values of the fields from 
the requirement that the effective action be stationary. E.g., a field φ with a potential V(φ), at a low temperature, will 
not settle in a local minimum of V(φ), but in a local minimum of the effective potential, which can be read off from 
the effective action. This gives (Sundrum, 2005):

USING OUR BOUND TO THE COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT  

We use our bound to the cosmological constant to obtain a conditional escape of gravitons from an early universe 
brane.  To  begin,  we  present  conditions  (Leach  and  Lesame,  2005)  for  gravitation  production.  Here  R   is 
proportional to the scale factor ‘distance’: 

Also, there exists an ‘impact parameter’: 

This leads, practically, to a condition of ‘accessibility’ via R so defined with respect to ‘bulk dimensions’: 

Here, k = 0 for flat space, k = -1 for hyperbolic three space, and k = 1 for a three sphere, while a radius of curvature:  

This assumes a negative bulk cosmological constant 
We assume emission of a graviton from a bulk horizon via scale factor, so 
effective potential of gravitons defined via: 

5 dim−Λ

and that  μ is a five-dimensional Schwartzshield mass. 
. Then we have a maximum

This leads to a bound with respect to release of a graviton from an anti De Sitter brane (Leach and Lesame, 2006) as:  

In the language of general relativity, anti de Sitter space is the maximally symmetric vacuum solution of Einstein's 
field equation with a negative cosmological constant Λ. Mathematically, anti de Sitter space can be: 

This formulation gives to AdSn an homogeneous space structure related to branes. Our universe is a five-dimensional 
anti  de  Sitter  space  and  the  elementary  particles,  except  for  the  graviton,  are  localized  on  a  (3 + 1)-dimensional 
brane. In this setting, branes, and p-branes, are spatially extended objects that appear in string theory. The variable p

of the universe; it relates physical coordinates to comoving coordinates. For the FLRW model: 

where  L  is  the  physical  distance  λ%   is  the  distance  in  comoving  units,  and  a(t)  is  the  scale  factor.  While  general 
relativity  allows  formulating  the  laws  of  physics  using  arbitrary  coordinates,  comoving  coordinate  choices  are 
natural,  easy  to  work  with  options;  they  assign  constant  spatial  values  to  comoving  observers  who  perceive  the 
universe  as  isotropic.  They  are  called  comoving  observers  because  they  move  with  the  Hubble  flow.  Comoving 
distance, the distance between two points measured along a path of constant cosmological time, can be computed by 
using te as the lower limit of integration as a time of emission:

Claim 2  breaks down completely when one has a strongly curved space, which is what we would expect in the first 
instant of less than Planck time evolution of the nucleation of a new universe.

Instead,  we  should  consider  what  can  be  done  with  S-S’  instanton  physics  (Beckwith,  2006a),  and  the  Bogolmyi 
inequality, in order to take into account baryogenesis, In physical cosmology, baryogenesis is the generic term for 
hypothetical  physical  processes  that  produced  an  asymmetry  between  baryons  and  anti-baryons  in  the  very  early 
universe, resulting in the substantial amounts of residual matter that comprise the universe today. 
EL  is almost the 
same as Eqn. (12) above and requires elaboration of Eqn. (13) above. We should think of Eqn. (13) happening in the 
Planck  brane  mentioned  above.  Keep  in  mind  that  there  are  many  baryogenesis  theories  in  existence,  The 
fundamental  difference  between  baryogenesis  theories  is  the  description  of  the  interactions  between  fundamental 
particles, and what we are doing with di quarks is actually one of the simpler ones. 

DI QUARK POTENTIAL SYSTEMS AND THE WHEELER DE-WITT EQUATION 

The Penn State University developed (Ashtekar, Pawlowski, and Singh;s 2006a) quantum bounce gives a discrete 
version of the Wheeler De Witt equation, we begin: 

as well as an energy term:

In addition Ashtekar et al. (Ashtekar, Pawlowski, and Singh, 2006a, 2006b) work with as a simplistic structure with 
a  revision  of  the  differential  equation  assumed  in  Wheeler-De  Witt  theory  to  a  form  characterized  by 
2φ∂ ∂
2
. This will lead to  Ψ  having roughly the form alluded to in Eqn. (33), which in 
early universe geometry will eventually no longer be LP but will have a discrete geometry. This may permit an early 
universe  ‘quantum  bounce’  and  an  outline  of  an  earlier  universe  collapsing,  and  then  being  recycled  to  match 
present day inflationary expansion parameters. The main idea behind the quantum theory of a (big) quantum bounce 
is  that,  as  density  approaches  infinity,  so  the  behavior  of  the  quantum  foam  changes.  The  foam  is  a  qualitative 
description of the turbulence that the phenomenon creates at extremely  small distances of the order of the Planck 
length. At such small scales of time and space the uncertainty principle allows particles and energy to briefly come 
into  existence,  and  then  annihilate,  without  violating  conservation  laws.  As  the  scale  of  time  and  space  being 
discussed  shrinks,  the  energy  of  the  virtual  particles  increases.  At  sufficiently  small  scale  space  is  not  smooth  as 

would  be  expected  from  observations  at  larger  scales.  This  is  where  Ashtekar  and  other  researchers  (Ashtekar, 
Pawlowski,  and  Singh,  2006a,  2006b)  put  in  their  variation  from  earlier  Wheeler–De  Witt  theory,  with  discrete 
segments  of  space  to  work  with,  and  discrete  time  intervals  as  a  lower  bound  to  cosmology.  Here  Vμ   is  the 
eigenvalue  of  a  so  called  volume  operator  and  we  need  to keep  in  mid  that  the  main  point  made  above,  is  that  a 
potential  operator  based  upon  a  quadratic  term  leads  to  a  Gaussian  wave  function  with  an  exponential  similarly 
2φ exponent. This permits a match up with Eqn. (11) and Eqn. (12) above, with some 
dependent upon a quadratic 
additional curved space structure considerations thrown in.  

DETECTING GRAVITONS AS SPIN 2 OBJECTS WITH AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY 

To briefly review what we can say now about standard graviton detection schemes, as mentioned above, Rothman 
(Rothman,  and  Boughn,  2006)  states  that  Dyson  seriously  doubts  we  will  be  able  to  detect  gravitons  via  present 
detector technology. The conundrum is that if one defines the criterion for observing a graviton as:

This  has  L Lγ
  a  graviton  sources  luminosity  divided  by  total  luminosity  and R  as  the  distance  from  the  graviton 
2 /
source,  to  a  detector.  Furthermore, 
h   a  constant  while γε   is  the  graviton  P.E.  A  datum  to 
pGm
consider  is  that  the  probability  of  graviton  interaction  with  the  detector  ‘matter’  is  of  the  order  of  10  to  the  -60 
power, whereas that for a corresponding photon would be significant orders of magnitude higher. As stated in the 
manuscript,  the  problem  then  becomes  determining  a  cross  section  σ   for  a  graviton  production  process  and  
. Here, a four-dimensional graviton emission cross section goes like 1/M. The existence of branes is relevant to 
f
γ
graviton production.  In addition, it would permit us to give in confirmation of the existence of Ashtekar’s candidate 
for a discrete wave functional for a modified Wheeler de Witt equation we would write up as follows. The point is 
that  if  we  understand  the  contribution  of  Eqn.  (45)  above  to  space  time  dynamics,  we  will  be  able  to  confirm  or 
falsify the existence of space-time conditions as given by a non LP structure as implied below.  This will entail either 
confirming  or  falsifying  the  structure  given  to  Θ .  Also,  and  more  importantly  the  above  mentioned    Θ   is  a 
difference operator, allowing for a treatment of the scalar field as an ‘emergent time’, or ‘internal time’ so that one 
can set up a wave functional built about a Gaussian wave functional defined via:

The existence of gravitons in itself would confirm or falsify the existence of non LP structure in the early universe. 
This  structure  was  deemed  (Ashtekar,  Pawlowski,  and  Singh,  2006b)  crucial  to  reference  to  a  revision  of  this

With the advent of this re definition of momentum we are seeing what Ashtekar works with (Ashtekar, Pawlowski, 
and Singh, 2006a, 2006b) as a simplistic structure with a revision of the differential equation assumed in Wheeler-
De Witt theory to a form characterized by: 

Θ in this situation is such that: 

This, in itself, would permit confirmation of whether a quantum bounce condition existed in early universe geometry 
according to prediction (Ashtekar, Pawlowski, and Singh, 2006a, 2006b). Additionally, prior to brane theory we had 
a too crude model. Why? When we assume that a radius of an early universe—assuming the speed of light 
1c ≡  is 
of  the  order  of  magnitude  3 (
⋅ Δ ≅ —we  face  a  rapidly  changing  volume  that  is  heavily  dependent  upon  a  first 
order phase transition, as affected by a change in the degrees of freedom given by
. Without gravitons and 
a brane-world structure, such a model is insufficient to account for dark matter production, even fails to account for 
baryogenesis.  It  also  will  lead  to  new  graviton  detection  equipment  re-configuration  well  beyond  the  scope  of 
falsifiable  models  configured  along  the  lines  of  simple  phase  transitions  (Banerjee,  and  Gavai,  1993)  given  for

GRAVITON SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS 

Solving this final set of experimental requirements lets us consider an ensemble of wave functions for a common 
generic phase evolution. If we go back to an exponential phase behavior for Eqn. (11), and go from Euclidian time 
to regular time, we recover a phase evolution behavior; so we can use the quantum mechanics theorem that two or 
more wave functions with common phase behavior contain the same physical information. Such research facilitates 
practical efforts for generating gravitational waves in a quantum vacuum field. To do this would move warp drive 
research to become a testable datum, and also investigate the role extra dimensions may play in actual space drives. 
Once  we  understand  how  gravitons  are  produced  in  a  natural  setting,  it  would  permit  us  to  investigate  the  role 
gravitons play in exotic propulsion systems, i.e., in the early universe model. If that does not work, we at least will 
know and investigate another approach using near field, macro-quantum coherent states of virtual quanta not beams 
of on-mass-shell quantum ejected out the "nozzle" like any rocket propellant be it atoms, photons or gravitons. 

CONCLUSION  

1000

To answer Guth (2006), when there are 
vacuum states produced by String theory and when inflation produces 
overwhelmingly  one  preferred  type  of  vacuum  states  over  other  possible  vacuum  states,  Eqn. (55)  is  too  inexact. 
Instead,  we  have  baryogenesis  consistent  with  Eqn. (1)  for 
  interval.  This  is,  for  a  critical  temperature  CT , 
defined  in  the  neighborhood  of  an  initial  grid  of  time
.  If  so,  baryogenesis  plays  a  role  in  forming  early 
t
Δ ≈
universe  wave  functions  that  are  congruent  with  the  Wheeler  De  Witt  equation.  We  need  to  investigate  whether 
these wave functions are congruent with a quantum bounce. If they are, it lends credence to the supposition of an 
earlier  universe  imploding  due  to  contraction  at  the  point  of  expansion  at  birth  of  our  universe  (Ashtekar, 
Pawlowski, and Singh, 2006a). According to a brane-world interpretation, gravitons produce in great number in the 
  neighborhood.  This  depends  on  the  ‘cosmological  constant’  temperature.  A  Randall-Sundrum  effective 
t
Δ ≈
potential (Sundrum, 2005) that embeds an earlier than axion potential structure is a primary candidate for an initial 
configuration of dark energy. This structure would, by baryogenesis, be a shift to dark energy. We need to configure 
JDEM space observations to determine whether WIMPS are tied to the dark energy released after a 
 interval.

Key ideas: Density determination from a distance, gravitational imaging, gravitational 

flux and gravitational Gauss’ law.  

Gravitational field of many common objects are small but in the detectable µGal- 

nGal (g, mean free fall acceleration on earth ~10 m/s2) range. Here we show that by 

applying gauss’ law to the exterior field data one can estimate the interior mass density of 

the object. With the development of wide band width, nano (10-9/s2) or Eotovs range 

accelerometers it may also be possible to reconstruct and image the distribution of 

interior matter distribution.  

Gravitation the first fundamental force of nature 

Gravitation is one of the four fundamental “interactions” of nature. It is 

characterized by Newton’s universal constant of gravitation, G or by the Planck mass, 

Mp=(ħc/G )1/2 ~10-8 kg where, c is the speed of light,  ħ is Planck constant [1 & 2]. In 

spite of being the “first physical law” and its four century long history, the full theoretical 

understanding gravitation remains elusive. Also, because of the small value of G 

(6.67x10-11 SI), gravitational forces of laboratory objects are rather weak. Perhaps not 

coincidentally except for the critical general relativistic corrections in global positioning 

systems (GPS) and some geophysical prospecting, gravity has not witnessed the

explosion of technological applications associated with electromagnetism and quantum 

mechanical systems.  

We reason that with present day gravitational sensors the mass and density of 

many manmade objects can be determined from a distance. Furthermore with the 

development of faster and higher resolution accelerometers gravitational tomography 

may also become a reality. In this context we are restricting this discussion to 

conventional understanding of gravitation in 3+1 space time. Also not referring to the 

astrophysical phenomenon of “gravitational lensing and imaging”, instead we imply 

visualization techniques such as scanning probe microscopy to X-ray CAT scans. 

To estimate the scale of the gravitational field (F) we are dealing with let us 

calculate the (horizontal) acceleration close to the surface of a concrete column of radius 

(R) one meter, using cylindrical symmetry and a concrete density of 2.3x103 kg/m3  we 

obtain:

In equation 1, λ is the linear density of the column material. Note to calculate λ from 

equation 1 it is not enough just to measure acceleration in the µGal regime. Because at 

any one point F is the vector superposition of all the fields produced by the gravitating 

matter distributed everywhere in the universe! In addition, the extraneous gravity 

contributions are often time dependant [3] and such temporal variations can be significant. 

Gravitational gauss’ law 

One way to avoid the dc-background is by gauss’ law which relates the total 

gravitational flux Φgrav to M, the total mass enclosed as follows

For equation 2 to be useful, the surface has to enclose the source. Furthermore, in 

the case of cylindrical symmetry and small diameter to length ratio, or close to the 

cylindrical surface one obtains:

Where, φ is the average flux per unit height ∆z.  It can also be shown that with cylindrical 

symmetry the integral of equation 2 can be approximated by a finite sum of field data (F) 

obtained from N measurements at vector positions R(x,y) as follows,

As shown in the equations above the total flux is related to the surface integral of the 

symmetric or interior products of R and F, it can also be shown that the asymmetric or 

exterior product Rx F is related to the net torque τ.  Net torque will be zero for central 

fields.  

A simple example 

To test these ideas let us consider a synthetic problem of three vertical cylinders 

of mass density λ1, λ2 and λ3  be located at positions r1, r2, and r3 as indicated in figure 1.

Figure-1: A mock up distribution of three cylindrical source masses of linear 

density λi located at positions ri within a circular boundary (black) are shown. The fields 

F due to the cylinders, at twelve points Ri on an exterior (blue) circle of radius R are 

considered. For clarity only four positions R1, R4 , R7 & R4 are marked.  

This is a case of a non uniform mass distribution of total linear mass density of 6 

λ1. For this synthetic demonstration let us first calculate the Newtonian field F(R) at the 

measurement or field points (R) due to the three cylinders as given by:

The constant k, in equation 6 contains all the dimensional factors such as G and 

the mass and length scales of the problem. To be specific, let us compute the F fields (as 

in fig. 1) at just twelve points Ri (1≤i≤12) at 30 deg intervals on the circumference of the 

exterior circle of radius R equal to 10 units. The mass densities be λ1=1, λ2=2* λ1 and λ3 

=3* λ1 respectively located at positions r1 (9,0) r2 (0,5) and r3 (-3,-1). Table 1 gives the 

calculated values of the various quantities pertaining to the equations above. Columns 

one and two are the (polar) coordinates of the measurement points, the third column

provides the field (in relative units) data and four is polar angle of field direction. Five 

and six give the contribution to the flux and torque sums respectively. 

The changes in both the magnitude and direction of the field as listed in table 1 

are indications of a non symmetric density (mass) distribution. To help visualizing these 

results especially the inhomogeneous distribution a three-d map of the field is displayed 

in fig.2.

Remarkably, a dozen exterior measurements are adequate to provide a reasonable 

estimate of the enclosed (mass) density. Quantitatively, the field changes by ~20%, the 

average of the flux φ is 6.2, within a few per cent of the exact value of 6 units and the 

total torque is found to be zero. As mentioned above, a casual perusal of the field map 

shown in figure 2 makes the non-uniformity of the interior mass distribution eminently 

clear. It appears that with present day sensors and computers it may be possible to tell if 

there are large air pockets or perhaps even determine the locations of the steel 

reinforcement bars inside a concrete pillar. Incidentally, here  we are considering the 

entire gravitational field at the field point and not doing gradiometry; gravitational 

gradiometry is relevant in geophysical prospecting.

A topical iteration of a 3rd century BC conundrum 

To the best of present day knowledge of all the fundamental interactions gravity 

cannot be screened, obscured or controlled [4]. Can this unique property be useful?  First, 

recall that in the 3rd century BC, Hiero, the king of Syracuse is reputed to have inquired 

Archimedes about the purity of a gold crown; in modern terms the physical question was 

how to find the volume of an irregularly shaped object, the crown. From volume and total 

mass, calculating the average density, the distinguishing parameter of gold purity was 

reduced to a trivial matter. Now imagine a 21 century, say a plutonium ingot is concealed 

inside a block of lead and that by a cleaver design of void spaces the overall density and 

center of mass are matched to bulk lead. The conundrum is how to reveal the dense 

embedded object by exterior measurements alone. No matter how perfect the radiation 

shielding of lead may be the gravitational signature of the anomalous regions will show 

up! Furthermore, from the gravitational field it may be possible to reconstruct the hidden 

mass distribution.  

Concluding remarks

Because gravitational field of human size objects is weak the idea of imaging with 

gravitaty may appear “not to work in principle” – but a lot of things have been proven to 

work when the appropriate principles are recognized [5]. Aside from some differences 

such as: (i) no external source of radiation. (ii) Source and detector are not both under 

control only the detector in control and (iii) gravitational influence is not restricted to be 

along line of sight, the concept presented here is really very similar to CAT scan. With 

6

the advent of faster and more sensitive accelerometers such imaging processes may 

become practical.

Abstract

A novel technique to identify small fluxes of mixed highly charged

ion  beams  extracted  from  an  Electron  Beam  Ion  Trap  (EBIT)  is

presented  and  practically  demonstrated.  The  method  exploits

projectile  charge  state  dependent  potential  emission  of  electrons  as

induced  by  ion  impact  on  a  metal  surface  to  separate  ions  with

identical or very similar mass-to-charge ratio.

1. INTRODUCTION

An  Electron  Beam  Ion  Trap  (EBIT  [1]) is a device to breed, store, investigate and also to

extract highly charged ions (HCIs) [2-6]. In an EBIT, the ions of interest are produced by

bombardment  with  a  mono-energetic  electron  beam.  Their  motion  is  radially  and  axially

confined  by  the  electron  beam  space  charge  and  potentials  applied  to  a  set  of  drift  tube

electrodes,  respectively.  During  their  confinement  in  the  trap,  the  ions  are  brought

consecutively to higher charge states by collisions with beam electrons (see e.g. [6-9] and

refs. therein).

EBITs  are  used  to  investigate  a  wide  variety  of  processes  related  to  the  physics  of  highly

charged ions. Of fundamental importance are spectroscopic measurements of line radiation

emitted  from  excited  HCIs  in  order  to  test  relativistic  quantum  mechanics,  quantum

electrodynamics  (QED),  electron  correlation  and  nuclear  physics  (for  recent  work  see  e.g.

[10-12]). More recently, ion beams extracted from an EBIT are utilized in a wide range of

applications, from those associated with fusion plasma physics to those associated with nano-

scale device fabrication [6-8])

Most  EBITs  utilize  superconducting  magnets  which  not  only  provide  the  necessary

compression of the electron beam but also allow for cryopumping of the trap region. The base

pressure  in  an  EBIT  is  therefore  quite  low  (≤  10-10  mbar).  However,  cryopumping  also

conserves a memory on previously used other working gases. Extracted ion beams therefore

usually do not only contain ions of the desired working gas in different charge states but also

a mixture of different ion species with comparable mass-to-charge ratios. Mass scans of ion

beams extracted from an EBIT usually performed with an analyzing sector magnet can thus

be quite complex, with the ions of interest not identifiable in a straight-forward manner.

We  have  devised  a  new  method  for  characterizing  extracted  highly  charged  ion  beams  by

means of the potential emission of electrons as induced by ion impact on a metal surface. In

the following this method will be explained and demonstrated in a practical case.

3

2. EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

The details of the Heidelberg EBIT can be found elsewhere [9]. In its continuous mode of

operation, also referred to as leaky or dc mode, ions that have enough thermal energy escape

the trap by overcoming the electrostatic barrier at the confining drift tube held at constant

potential. Extracted ions are replaced continuously by injected gas atoms. The extracted ion

beam contains different ion species with various charge states. The ion beam is focused by an

Einzel-lens and transported to the experimental chamber via a 90° analyzing magnet which is

used to separate ions with desired mass-to-charge.

For the present study the central drift tube of the EBIT is biased to +6.4 kV, with the trap

potential  set  to  +210  V.  360mA  emission  current  from  the  electron  gun  leads  to  a  space

charge  potential  of  -250  V.  That  determines  the  ion  extraction  energy  of  6.35  kV.  The

electron gun itself was biased to -7.5 kV, which together with a cathode bias of another -1.5

kV yields an electron beam energy of 15.1 kV, sufficient to produce bare Ar18+, He-like Xe52+

or Ne-like W64+.

A typical mass over charge scan showing the number of transported ions versus the field of

the  analyzing  magnet  (already  converted  into  a  mass-to-charge  ratio)  for  continuously

extracted ions is shown in fig. 1. For this scan 129Xe has been used as working gas, but the ion

beam is apparently strongly contaminated and even dominated by residual gas ions (mainly

oxygen and carbon) as well as by still present ions from  40Ar (used as working gas shortly

before). There is no possibility to distinguish between ions with identical mass over charge

ratio  with  a  scan  like  this.  In  our  simple  EBIT  diagnostic  device  the  ion  beam  enters  a

differentially pumped UHV chamber before hitting a clean metal surface under close to 30°

angle of incidence (fig. 2). In our case we use a sputter-cleaned, single crystalline Au(111)

target, but any other clean (polycrystalline) metal surface would do as well.

To detect the number of emitted electrons we apply a slightly modified version of the electron

detection  scheme  described  by  Lemell  et  al.  [13].  Electrons  emitted  from  the  ion-surface

interaction region are extracted by a weak electric field through a highly transparent grid and

accelerated onto a surface barrier type detector (Canberra PD 100-12-300 AM) biased at +25

kV. Ray-trace calculations performed for this geometry with the program SIMION showed

4

that a field of about 100 V/cm is sufficient to collect all electrons with energies below 50 eV

emitted into the half solid angle. Electron emission induced by a single projectile ion will be

finished in a time much shorter than the time resolution of the applied detector electronics.

Thus, n  electrons emitted due to a particular ion impact will be registered like one  electron of

n.25 keV rather than n individual  25  keV  electrons.  The  number  of  electrons  emitted  in  a

particular  ion-impact  event  can  therefore  be  deduced  from  the  detectors  pulse  height

distribution.  More  details  on  this  electron  number  detection  method  and  its  appropriate

evaluation can be found elsewhere ([13, 14] and refs. therein).

In general, if slow (impact velocity << 1a.u., corresponding to 25 keV/amu) HCIs collide with

a metal surface, the majority of electrons is emitted by a process called potential emission

(PE), where the potential energy of the ion (i.e. the sum of all ionization potentials) rather

then it’s kinetic energy (giving rise to the so-called kinetic emission – KE) dominates the total

electron  emission  process  [15,  16].  PE  from  metal  surfaces  has  been  found  to  strongly

increase with the ion potential energy and hence it’s charge state [5, 16].

It  is  the  information  on  the  precise  number  of  the  emitted  electrons  which  allows  us  to

separate ions with identical or very similar mass-to-charge ratio (see chap. 3). To this purpose

the analyzing magnet is continuously scanned while for each individual ion impact event the

number of emitted electrons is recorded in coincidence with the actual value of the magnetic

field (fig. 3). For this technique typical projectile fluxes at the target must not exceed a few

ten-thousand ions per second in order to avoid pulse pile-up, but may be as low as a few ions

per second, which in fact makes the present method ideally suited for use with an EBIT ion

source.

5

3. RESULTS

In fig. 4 the number of emitted electrons has been added as a second dimension to the mass

over  q  scan  shown  in  fig.  1.  Each  ion  impact  event  is  now  characterized  not  only  by  the

respective nominal charge to mass ratio (x-axis) but also by the amount of emitted electrons

(y-axis). A series of distinct peaks are visible in this 2D-spectrum. While residual gas ions

(Oq+,  Cq+, etc.) are most prominent in intensity, their charge state (and potential energy) is

comparably low, resulting in an electron emission yield of typically less than 10 e-/ion. They

can thus easily be discriminated from higher charged ions like the full series of Xeq+ ions (q =

13 - 51). The series of HCIs from 40Ar is still visible and clearly separated from the Xeq+ HCIs

in the 2D-scan of fig. 4.

While the most prominent ions species could have been identified in a careful magnetic mass

scan alone, the 2D scan in addition allows to identify trace ion species in the spectrum as well.

Ions  ejecting  more  than  150  electrons  per  impact  event  carry  a  higher  charge  than  all  Xe

projectiles used. These ions were identified as Wq+ (60≤q≤64) HCIs from the cathode material

of  the  EBITs  electron  gun,  successively  trapped  and  ionized  in  the  EBIT  itself.  As  three

isotopes of tungsten are present (m=182, 184 and 186), the individual charge states cannot be

separated anymore. Small peaks between the Xeq+ peaks in the region 19≤q≤21 point to ions

with  similar  mass  but  slightly  higher  charge  state  than  Xe  (because  of  the  slightly  higher

electron emission yield). They are identified as Baq+ (20≤q≤25) ions (also orginating from the

e-gun).  Cuq+  (15≤q≤23)  ions  (material  of  the  EBIT  drift  tubes)  and  traces  of  sulfur  and

fluorine HCIs  are  visible in  the  vicinity of  the  Arq+  peaks.  Note  that  the  Baq+  series  has  a

different  spacing  on  the  mass-over-charge  axis  between  its  individual  peaks  than  the Xeq+

series.  Due  to  this  fact  it  is  possible  to  distinguish  even  between  two  species,  which  have

similar mass and charge, which would be impossible using a 1D electron number spectrum

alone.

A "partial" Xeq+ mass spectrum can be obtained (fig. 5) by properly selecting the region of

interest as shown in the insert in fig. 5. Such a pure Xe spectrum is very convenient for an

easy calibration of the relation between the field of the analyzing magnet and the mass-to-

charge scale. The image also shows a distinct drop in rates for charge states higher than Xe44+.

6

Apart from the choice of extraction parameters, this is also explained by the high ionization

energies of the L shell and the fact that the trapping force in an EBIT increases linearly with

q. Hence, the higher charge states are always underrepresented in an extraction spectrum from

an EBIT in leaky mode, As the trap preferentially expels ions with lower charge states in a

process called evaporative cooling. This also explains the presence of a population of tungsten

in charge states from 60 to 64 with ionization potentials from 6.1 keV to 7.1 keV, and the lack

of its lower charge states. Tungsten is accumulated in the trap very slowly, in a time in the

order of minutes and therefore, all tungsten ions reach a very similar charge state.

In our case the target is mounted on a manipulator, so the HCIs of choice selected in this way

can  subsequently  be  used  for  performing  experiments  further  downstream  by  simply

retracting the target (fig. 1). In the case of a true mass-to-charge coincidence between two

different ion species, the ratio between the two HCI-species can at least be quantified [17]

(due  to  an  almost  100%  efficiency  of  HCI  detection  because  of  the  high  electron  yields

involved) and also optimized by tuning the ion source parameters.

Our technique not only provides a complete quantitative analysis of all ion beam fractions, it

is also easily implemented, well suited to be incorporated into an existing beam-line and can

be  performed  in  a  time  comparable  to  that  of  a  usual  ion  beam  mass  scan  (typically  20

minutes).

Abstract 

 

The molecular structures of the monomeric, pentacoordinated methylchloroniobium(V) compounds 

Me3NbCl2  and  Me2NbCl3  have  been  determined  by  gas  electron  diffraction  (GED)  and  Density 
Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and, for Me3NbCl2, by single crystal X-ray diffraction. Each 

of the molecules is found to have a heavy-atom skeleton in the form of a trigonal bipyramid (TBP) 

with Cl atoms in the axial positions, in accord with their vibrational spectra. The TBP is somewhat 

distorted in the case of Me2NbCl3 with the two axial Nb–Cl bonds bent away from the equatorial, 

slightly  shorter  Nb–Cl  bond.  In  the  case  of  Me3NbCl2,  moreover,  the  X-ray  model  suggests 

structural  distortions  away  from  the  idealized  C3h  geometry,  in  line  with  the  results  of  quantum 

chemical calculations. Structure optimizations by DFT calculations and least-squares refinement to 

the  GED  data  yield  the  following  structural  parameters  (calc/exp;  eq  =  equatorial;  ax  =  axial; 

distances in Å, angles in degrees; average values in <>-brackets): Me3NbCl2, in C3v symmetry, Nb–

Cl <2.370>/<2.319(3)>, Nb–C 2.173/2.152(4), C–H <1.096>/1.124(5), ∠NbCH <109.3>/105.2(8), 

∠ClNbC  92.2/93.3(2),  ∠CNbC  119.9/119.7(1);  Me2NbCl3, 

in  C2v  symmetry,  Nb–Clax 

2.361/2.304(5), Nb–Cleq 2.321/2.288(9), Nb–C 2.180/2.135(9), C–H <1.094>/1.12(1), ∠ClaxNbCleq 

98.5/96.5(6),  ∠CNbC  121.0/114(2),  ∠NbCH  <108.9>/109(2).  The  electronic  structures  of 

Me2NbCl3 and Me3NbCl2 have been explored by rigorous analysis of both the wavefunction and the 

topology  of  the  electron  density,  employing  DFT  calculations.  Hence  the  structures  of  these 

compounds are shown to reflect repulsion between the Nb–C and Nb–Cl bonding electron density 

and charge concentrations induced by the methyl ligands in the valence shell of the Nb atom and 

arising mainly from use of Nb(4d) functions in the Nb–C bonds.

1. Introduction 

 

Pentacoordinate  molecules  are  intriguing  as  they  possess  no  low-energy  geometry  with 

equivalent  sites:  the  characteristic  fluxionality  of  many  such  systems  derives  from  the  energetic 

proximity  of,  and  facile  interconversion  between,  the  trigonal  bipyramid  (TBP)  and  the  square-

based pyramid (SQP). Typical examples are coordinatively unsaturated, allowing for facile inter- as 
well  as  intra-molecular  ligand  exchange,[1]  and  such  systems  are  apt  also  to  display  the  lasting 
effects of intermolecular interaction or exchange, as witnessed by the solid-state structure of PCl5.[2] 

Pentacoordinate derivatives of the Group 15 elements played a central rôle four decades ago in the 
formulation  and  refinement  of  the  VSEPR  theory.[3]  The  TBP-derived  structures  deduced  by  gas 

3 

electron  diffraction  (GED)  studies  of  molecules  such  as  Me2PF3

[4]  and  Me3PF2

[5]  led  to  the 

development of concepts such as apicophilicity, and to much discussion of the bonding displayed 
by  such  hypervalent  main  group  systems.[6]  By  contrast,  analogous  derivatives  of  the  Group  5 

elements  V,  Nb,  and  Ta  have  received  relatively  little  attention.  Thus,  although  the  compounds 
MenNbCl5-n (n = 1-3) have been known for three decades,[7] no structural studies of these or other 
gaseous monomeric species of the type MenMX5-n (M = V, Nb, or Ta; X = halogen; n = 1-5) have 
been reported to date, with the exceptions of TaMe5,[8] Me3TaF2,[9] and Me3TaCl2.[10] 

Mononuclear pentavalent compounds of the Group 5 elements with monodentate ligands are 

generally  found  to  resemble  analogous  derivatives  of  the  Group  15  elements  in  adopting  a  TBP 
coordination  geometry.  There  are,  however,  some  exceptions,  notably  TaMe5,[8]  SbPh5,[11]  and 
BiPh5,[12] in each of  which the five-coordinate central  atom  forms  an SQP rather than a TBP. No 

single  reason  for  this  change  is  universally  recognized  (q.v.).  Although  electronic  effects  are 

important,  there  is  evidence,  at  least  for  selected  main  group  compounds,[13]  that  ligand...ligand 

interactions play a significant part in dictating the preference for a particular geometry.  

The  past  decade  has  witnessed  a  realization  that  the  coordination  geometry  of  d0 transition-

metal  (TM)  centers  is  controlled  by  factors  distinct  from  those  espoused  by  VSEPR  theory  in  its 
simplest  form.[14]  Since  the  pioneering  studies  by  Eisenstein  et  al.,[15]  which  predicted  a  non-
VSEPR  geometry  for  [TiH6]2–  on  the  basis  of  extended  Hückel  calculations,  several  prominent 
examples  of  non-VSEPR  d0  TM  structures  -  most  notably  [ZrMe6]2–,[16]  Me2TiCl2,[17]  and 
[18,19]  -    have  been  confirmed  by  structural  and  spectroscopic  techniques,  or  have  been 
W(CH3)6
predicted  by  theoretical  studies.[14,19]  Several  models  based  on  MO  theory  have  been  advanced  to 
rationalize this phenomenon,[14,19] but these cannot compete with the simplicity and success rate of 

the  VSEPR  model  in  predicting  the  geometries  of  main  group  molecules.  It  is  not  surprising, 

therefore,  that  attempts  have  been  made  to  develop  further  the  VSEPR  concept.  In  a  pioneering 
study, Gillespie et al.[20] proposed topological analysis of the charge density as a non-empirical way 

of accounting for the polarization of metal atoms, and discovered so-called ligand-induced charge 

concentrations (LICCs) to exist trans to the M–X bonds in the non-linear alkaline-earth dihalides. 
As with these geometries, which are also successfully predicted by the polarized ion model,[21] so 

too more generally does polarization of the metal by the coordinating ligands seem to be a primary 

factor in promoting distortion away from the expected VSEPR geometries. In fact, Bader et al. had 

shown  earlier  that  the  presence  of  ligands  in  covalent  or  polar  molecules  induces  local  charge 

concentrations  (CCs)  in  the  valence  shell  of  the  central  atom  which  are  revealed  by  an  Atoms  in 

Molecules (AIM) Theory analysis as (3,–3) critical points (CPs) in the Laplacian function  L(r)  =   

–∇2ρ(r) of the charge density.[22] Furthermore, the number and relative positions of these so-called 

valence shell charge concentrations (VSCCs) not only depend on, but also counteract, the number 

4 

and  relative  positions  of  the  localized  electron  pairs  (electron  pair  domains)  associated  with  the 

bonding and non-bonding electron pairs of the VSEPR model. Despite the success of this concept in 
predicting  the  geometries  of  some  non-VSEPR  compounds,  such  as  Me2TiCl2,[23]  the  true  nature 

and origin of the VSCCs remained unclear.  In a recent experimental and theoretical charge density 
study of agostic d0 TM alkyls, however, VSCCs have been shown to originate in the formation of 

covalent  M–C  bonds  employing  valence  d-orbitals  at  the  metal,  thereby  endowing  the  extended 
VSEPR concept with a rational physical basis.[24]  

In order to develop the extended VSEPR model further and  to test its predictive  power, we 
have searched for new non-VSEPR benchmark structures. In this respect, heteroleptic d0 derivatives 

of  Group  5  offer  a  unique  opportunity  on  account  of  their  highly  flexible  coordination  geometry, 

which  leads  to  a  variety  of  structural  possibilities.  The  relatively  high  volatility  of  the  niobium 

compounds  Me2NbCl3  and  Me3NbCl2,  allied  to  their  accessibility  and  ease  of  purification,  has 

therefore prompted us to determine the structures of these molecules not only by quantum chemical 

calculations,  but  also  experimentally  by  GED  and  single-crystal  X-ray  measurements.  The  results 

invite comparison with those of related pentacoordinate molecules centered on a Group 5 or Group 

15  element,  and  also  with  the  structures  reported  for  other  non-VSEPR  compounds,  such  as  the 

tetracoordinate Group 4 molecule Me2TiCl2

[17] and the pentacoordinate Group 7 one Me3ReO2.[25]  

 

 

2. Experimental and Computational Section 

Me2NbCl3  and  Me3NbCl2  were  each  prepared  by  the  reaction  of  NbCl5  with  Me2Zn[26]  in 
pentane,  according  to  the  procedures  of  Fowles  et  al.,  and  of  Juvinall,  respectively.[7]  In  typical 

experiments 1.00 g (3.7 mmol) of NbCl5 in n-pentane solution reacted with 0.35 g (3.7 mmol) or 

0.60 g (6.3 mmol) of ZnMe2 to give Me2NbCl3 or Me3NbCl2, respectively. The volatile materials 

were separated by vaporization and fractional condensation in vacuo in all-glass apparatus, and the 
purity of each was assessed by reference to the 1H NMR spectrum of a CD2Cl2 solution[7] and to the 
IR spectrum of the annealed solid condensate at −196 °C.[27] NMR spectra were recorded using a 

Bruker AM500  MHz  spectrometer. IR spectra of solid films and of solid N2 matrices doped with 

Me2NbCl3 or Me3NbCl2 were measured with a Perkin Elmer 580B dispersive spectrometer with an 
optimal resolution of 0.5 cm–1. Raman spectra were recorded for solutions in CCl4 and C6H6 using a 
Perkin-Elmer  1700X  FT-Raman  spectrometer  at  a  resolution  of  4  cm–1.  Samples  for  electron 

diffraction were sealed in glass ampoules and stored at −196 °C until required. 

Gas  electron  diffraction  data  were  recorded  on  the  Balzers  KGD-2  unit  at  the  University  of 
Oslo.[28]  Experimental conditions and data processing details are summarized in Table 1 and in the 

Supporting Material.

can  be  obtained  free  of  charge  via  www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/conts/retrieving.html  (or  from  the

Calculations  on  Me3NbCl2,  Me2NbCl3  and  several  benchmark  systems  were  carried  out  in 
GAUSSIAN03  and  GAUSSIAN98.[29]  The  B3LYP/DZVP  computational  level[30,31,32]  will  be  our 

default  in  the  following.  The  built-in  NBO  code  of  the  GAUSSIAN98  program  was  used  for  the 
construction  of  orthonormal  natural  bond  orbitals  (NBOs).[33]  Topological  analyses  of  theoretical 
charge  densities  were  performed  with  the  program  system  AIMPAC[34]  and  the  NBO2WFN 

conversion  routine  developed  by  one  of  us  (D.  S.).  The  solid-state  structure  of  Me3NbCl2  was 
optimized  at  the  PBEPBE/LANL2DZ  computational  level[35,36]  with  the  periodic  boundary 
condition algorithm of Kudin and Scuseria[37] implemented in GAUSSIAN03.  

 

3. Results 

 

Vibrational spectra. For a pentacoordinated system MenMCl5-n (n = 2 or 3) centered on a M atom 

formally  possessing  a  10-electron  valence  electron  count,  the  VSEPR  model  predicts  a  TBP 

configuration  with  the  more  electronegative  Cl  substituents  occupying  axial  positions.  This  will 

give  the  C2NbCl3  skeleton  of    Me2NbCl3  C2v  symmetry,  with  stretching  vibrations  that  span  the 

representation 3a1 + 1b1 + 1b2. The C3NbCl2 skeleton of Me3NbCl2 will on the other hand have D3h 
symmetry with the vibrational representation 2a1' + 1a2" + 1e' for the stretching modes. The internal 

vibrations  of  the  methyl  groups,  which  resemble  closely  those  reported  for  the  molecules 
  and Me2TiCl2,[39] are unlikely to be useful reporters on the skeletal geometries of the 

MeTiCl3

[38]

molecules. 

Assignment of the skeletal fundamentals was assisted by reference to the vibrational spectra 
  and  Me3AsCl2,[42]  by  the  response  of  the  different 

reported  previously  for  NbCl5,[40]  Me2AsCl3

[41]

bands to deuteration of the methyl groups; and by the depolarization ratios of the  Raman bands of 

the molecules in solution. In the event, we find that the IR spectrum of Me2NbCl3 isolated in an N2 
matrix  contains at least  four  absorptions, two (at 340 and 382 cm–1) attributable  to ν(Nb–Cl)  and 

two (at 413 and 511 cm–1) attributable to ν(Nb–C) modes. In contrast, the IR spectrum of Me3NbCl2 
under  similar  conditions  shows  only  one  absorption  of  each  type  (at  375  and  518  cm–1, 

6 

respectively).  These  results  are  wholly  consistent  with  the  selection  rules  expected  to  operate  for 

molecular frameworks with the highest possible symmetries of C2v and D3h, respectively.  

Choice of models: DFT Calculations. The vibrational spectra of Me3NbCl2 imply axial siting of 

the  Cl  atoms,  with  D3h  symmetry  for  the  heavy-atom  skeleton.  With  due  allowance  for  the 

orientations  of  the  CH3  groups  in  the  equatorial  plane,  the  molecule  may  then  be  represented  by 

models  with  either  C3h  or  C3v  symmetry.  The  C3h  model  is  characterized  by  a  horizontal  mirror 
plane so that the NbC3 unit must lie in this plane together with one H atom of each CH3 group, and 

the two Nb–Cl distances must be equal. The C3v model (Figure 1b) can be derived from the C3h one 

by rotating all the CH3 groups through 30° in a clockwise sense so that one C–H bond in each CH3 

group eclipses the same Nb–Cl bond. Since this model does not imply any horizontal mirror plane, 

it  admits  the  possibilities  i)  that  the  Nb–Cl  distances  are  different,  and  ii)  that  the  ClNbC  angles 
differ  from  90°.  Such  a  model  is  indeed  stabilized  by  1  kJ  mol–1  in  the  DFT  calculations  in 

comparison  with  the  C3h  model;  the  Nb–Cl  bond  distances  differ  slightly  (by  0.012  Å)  with  the 

eclipsed Nb–Cl bond being the shorter, and subtending a ClNbC angle of 92.2°. In addition,  three  
imaginary  frequencies  for  methyl  group rotation (a" = –65.6617, e" = –65.0335, –65.0332 cm–1) 

classify the C3h model as a transition state on the potential energy surface between two forms of the 

minimum-energy  C3v  geometry.    We  note  that  the  C3v  model  is  in  accord  with  the  observed  IR 

spectrum,  since  the  skeletal  fundamentals  are  not  significantly  affected  by  the  orientation  of  the 

methyl groups in either D3h or C3v symmetry. 

The most likely configuration for Me2NbCl3 is based on a TBP model but with one equatorial 

CH3 group in this molecule replaced by a Cl atom. The skeletal symmetry is then C2v, as indicated 

by the vibrational spectra of the compound. Such a geometry is endorsed by our DFT calculations 

which find a potential energy minimum for a structure with the two CH3 groups oriented so as to 

maintain the symmetry of the skeleton, as shown in Figure 1c. With this symmetry, the axial Nb–Cl 

bonds are equivalent, but both the axial Cl–Nb–Cl and equatorial C–Nb–C angles are free to depart 

from the values of 180 and 120°, respectively, imposed on them by the idealized TBP model. 

Further ab initio and DFT calculations, employing different bases on Me3NbCl2, consistently 

returned the same findings, i.e. a C3v rather than a C3h equilibrium structure for Me3NbCl2 and a C2v 

one for Me2NbCl3, with only minor changes in the relevant dimensions (see Supporting Material for 

further information). Investigation of a C3 model for Me3NbCl2, generated by concerted rotation of 

the CH3 groups through 15° away from the C3v configuration, showed persistent convergence back 

to the C3v structure at all the computational levels employed. 

Structure refinements  

(i) Gas electron diffraction. Analysis and refinement of the GED data were accommodated by the 

models described above and represented in Figure 1. In each case, the CH3 groups were additionally 

7 

restricted to having local C3v symmetry and being equidimensional, in keeping with the results of 

the  DFT  calculations.  Hence  the  C3h  model  for  Me3NbCl2  is  described  by  four  independent 

parameters [the distances Nb–Cl, Nb–C, and C–H; and the angle ∠NbCH), while the C3v model is 

described by six such parameters (the distances Nb–Clav, Nb–C, C–H and ∆r = r(Nb–Cl') – r(Nb–

Cl'');  and  the  angles  ∠ClNbC  and  ∠NbCH].  The  C2v  model  for  Me2NbCl3  is  described  by  seven 

parameters: the distances Nb–Clax, Nb–Cleq, Nb–C, and C–H; and the angles ∠ClaxNbCleq, ∠CNbC, 

and  ∠NbCH.  The  DFT  calculations  permitted  vibrational  correction  terms  to  be  included  for 

Me2NbCl3  and  Me3NbCl2  (C3v)  but  not  for  Me3NbCl2  (C3h)  with  its  three  imaginary  vibrational 

frequencies. The refinements proceeded smoothly for a total of 17, 17 and 18 parameters (excluding 

scale  factors)  for  Me3NbCl2  (C3h),  Me3NbCl2  (C3v)  and  Me2NbCl3  (C2v),  respectively.  The 

difference ∆r between the axial Nb–Cl bond distances in the C3v model of Me3NbCl2 and the C…C 

amplitude in the C2v model of Me2NbCl3 could not be refined independently. For the purposes of 

the  GED  analysis,  the  magnitudes  of  these  two  parameters  were  therefore  set  equal  to  the  values 

indicated by the DFT calculations. The optimum values of salient parameters are presented in Table 

2 for Me3NbCl2 and Table 3 for Me2NbCl3.  In addition to the seven vibrational amplitudes listed 

for  Me3NbCl2  (C3v)  in  Table  2,  we  refined  four  non-bonded  Cl…H  amplitudes  as  independent 

parameters;  the  three  C…H  amplitudes  were  refined  with  constant  differences.  However,  these 

amplitudes were determined with large uncertainties and are therefore not included in the Table. For 

Me3NbCl2 (C3h) we refined, in addition to the seven vibrational amplitudes listed in the Table, three 

Cl…H and three C…H amplitudes as independent parameters, the remaining C…H amplitude being 

fixed  at  the  estimated  value  of  0.20  Å.  In  total,  11  vibrational  amplitudes  were  refined  for 

Me2NbCl3 (Table 3). Molecular scattering intensities and radial distribution curves are displayed in 

Figure 2. 

The  GED  analysis  gives  results  wholly  consistent  with  the  models  of  Me3NbCl2  and 

Me2NbCl3 depicted in Figure 1.   The axial siting of the Cl atoms in a TBP framework is at once 

confirmed  by  the  distinct  peak  near  4.6  Å  in  each  of  the  radial  distribution  curves  attributable  to 

scattering  from  the  Clax…Clax  atom  pairs  (see  Figure  2).      Less  good  in  places  is  the  agreement 

between the dimensions determined experimentally and those computed by our DFT methods, the 

calculated Nb–Cl distances being systematically longer than the experimental ones. We believe the 

GED results to be the more reliable and the discrepancies to arise primarily from deficiencies of the 

DFT approximations. 

For Me3NbCl2, it may be noted, the GED analysis shows a marginal preference for the C3h 

rather than the C3v model (R = 3.9 vs. 4.0%), although vibrational corrections have been included in 

one case but not the other. This contrasts with the outcome of the DFT calculations favoring, also 

8 

marginally, the C3v model. A similar indeterminate situation arises in the case of Me3AsCl2, a C3v 

model of which yields a lower energy than a C3h one in an HF study, while GED results come out 
with a slight preference for the latter model.[13] Whatever the symmetry of the equilibrium structure 

may be, it seems clear that the barrier to concerted internal rotation of the three methyl groups of 

both  molecules  is  smaller  than  the  thermal  energy  at  the  temperature  of  the  GED  experiments 
(namely RT = 2.5 kJ mol–1 at room temperature). For most molecules in the molecular beam, this 

means  virtually  unhindered  internal  rotation  of  the  methyl  groups.  In  order  to  secure  further 

evidence for the postulated distortions of Me3NbCl2 in the C3v DFT model, we have performed an 

X-ray study on a single crystal of Me3NbCl2.     

(ii)  X-ray  diffraction.  Crystals  of  Me3NbCl2  were  found  to  consist  of  essentially  discrete 

Me3NbCl2 molecules. The final model of Me3NbCl2 deduced from our X-ray diffraction experiment 

at  193  K  is  presented  in  Figure  3a  along  with  salient  structural  parameters.  The  Me3NbCl2 

molecules  display  a  hexagonal  close  packing  arrangement  (NiAs-type)  without  significant 

intermolecular  interactions.  Hence,  the  structural  parameters  of  Me3NbCl2  in  the  solid  state  are  in 

good agreement with those determined in the gas phase by GED and DFT calculations. Hence, in 

both states C3v models with pyramidal Me3Nb structures result. The dominant structural distortion 

of  the  Me3Nb  fragment  is  further  supported  by  periodic  DFT  optimization  of  the  solid  state 
structure[43] of Me3NbCl2, the deviations from C3h symmetry are clearly signaled by the Cl1–Nb–C 

angle  an  average  value  of  92.7°  for  the  DFT  model  (Figure  3b)  in  close  agreement  to  the 

experimental one of 93.7(7). Hence a consistent picture emerges from experimental and theoretical 

studies in the solid and gas phases: the C3NbCl2 skeleton displays a slightly pyramidal structure. 

 

Comparison  with  related  molecules.  In  Table  4  we  compare  the  dimensions  determined  for 

Me2NbCl3 and Me3NbCl2 with those reported in the literature for other TBP molecules of Groups 5 

and 15. Several features relating to the structure and bonding of TM and main group TBP molecules 

are revealed, as discussed below. 

A recent reinvestigation of the gaseous NbCl5 molecule on the basis of GED and high-level 

quantum chemical studies showed it to possess a TBP skeleton with D3h symmetry and axial and 
equatorial Nb–Cl bonds measuring 2.306(5) and 2.275(4) Å, respectively.[44] These come close to 

the  dimensions  we  have  found  for  the  corresponding  bonds  in  Me2NbCl3  [2.304(5)/2.288(9)  Å]. 

Me3NbCl2 invites comparison with the analogous tantalum compound. On the evidence of its GED 
pattern,[10] Me3TaCl2 is also a TBP molecule with skeletal bond distances, Ta–Clax 2.317(3) and Ta–

Ceq 2.158(5) Å, very close to the corresponding distances of the niobium compound [viz. Nb–Clax 

2.319(3)  and  Nb–Ceq  2.152(4)  Å  for  the  C3v  model].  This  similarity  provides  yet  another 

manifestation of the lanthanide contraction. 

9 

For species of the type MenMX5-n (M = P, As, or Sb; X = halogen), both r(M–C) and r(M–X) 

increase with increasing value of n. Any similar trend for the derivatives of niobium and tantalum 

appears much less marked. Furthermore, the difference in the lengths of axial and equatorial bonds, 

∆r = r(M–Xax) – r(M–Xeq), depends strongly on whether M is a Group 5 or a Group 15 element. In 

the former case, values of ∆r are found in the range 0.00-0.05 Å, whereas in the latter ∆r spans the 
[45]). This 

range 0.05-0.10 Å, the last value representing a 5% difference (in the P–Cl bonds of PCl5

familiar  behavior  of  the  Group  15  derivatives  has  been  rationalized  in  terms  of  the  effective 

electronegativity of the central atom and the hypervalent nature and consequent orbital deficiency 

of  the  molecule,  implying  a  significant  difference  in  polarity  between  axial  and  equatorial  M–X 
bonds.[46]  By  contrast,  the  Group  5  derivatives  have  no  such  problem  of  orbital  deficiency  in 

accommodating  bonding  electron  density;  if  anything,  they  are  electron-deficient,  at  least  with 
regard to the 18-electron rule.[47]  

In  both  Me2NbCl3  and  Me3NbCl2,  the  methyl  groups  occupy  exclusively  equatorial  sites, 

with  the  chloro  ligands  filling  the  remaining  positions.  In  this  respect  at  least,  they  resemble  the 
phosphoranes Me2PF3 and Me3PF2.[4,5] An interesting contrast with Me3NbCl2 is provided, though, 
by Me3ReO2,[25] which can be formally derived from the niobium compound by replacing the weak 

π-donor chloro ligands by strongly π-donating oxo ligands at the Group 7 metal center (Figure 1a). 

In  this  case,  both  oxo  ligands  occupy  equatorial  sites,  rather  than  the  axial  sites  favored  by  the 
chloro  ligands  in  Me3NbCl2,  in  what  has  been  described  as  an  edge-bridged  tetrahedral  (EBT)[48] 

structure.  

More striking, however, is the case of Me2NbCl3. Whereas the skeletal angles in the main 

group  compound  Me2PF3  conform  to  conventional  VSEPR  arguments  based  on  the  different 
electronegativities  of  the  methyl  and  fluoro  ligands  [∠FaxPFeq  =  88.9(3)°[4]],  those  of  Me2NbCl3 

show  that  it  has  to  be  classified  as  a  non-VSEPR  compound.  Thus,  the  axial  Nb–Cl  bonds  in 

Me2NbCl3  bend  away  from,  and  not  toward,  the  equatorial  Nb–Cl  bond;  at  96.5(6)°  the  angle 

∠ClaxNbCleq must be considered significantly larger than 90°, and this feature is also modeled by 

the  DFT  calculations.  At  the  same  time,  the  equatorial  C–Nb–C  unit  closes  down  from  120  to 
114(2)°, showing that the C atoms are pushed closer together.[49] Such a geometry contrasts with the 

normal VSEPR forecasts to the effect that the bonds to the less electronegative ligands have larger 
spatial requirements on the surface of the central atom and thus span a larger angle.[3] The observed 

structure  is  not  unprecedented,  however,  for  the  AX2Y2  molecule  Me2TiCl2  one  finds  the  Ti–Cl 

bonds  spanning  not  the  smallest  but  the  largest  angle,  with  ∠ClTiCl  =  117.3(3),  ∠ClTiC  = 

108.9(2), and ∠CTiC = 102.8(9)°,[17] an anomaly that cannot be explained by steric congestion of 

the individual M–C and M–Cl electron pair domains.  

It is clear that other factors not accounted for by the classical VSEPR  model are at work in 

10 

determining the geometry of Me2NbCl3.  Accordingly, we have carried out further DFT calculations 

to  explore  the  total  pattern  of  electron  localization  at  the  Nb  center  in  both  Me2NbCl3  and 
Me3NbCl2.  The  topology  of  the  Laplacian  of  the  electron  density,  ∇2ρ(r),  was  analyzed  to  reveal 

local charge concentrations at the metal atom likely to have a significant impact on the structures of 
these d0 TM alkyl derivatives.[20,22-24,50] To complement the studies, we outline for the first time a 

concept  that  explains  the  nature  and  occurrence  of  LICCs  by  a  rigorous  interpretation  of  the 

wavefunctions of  Me3NbCl2 and Me2NbCl3, which may be regarded as paradigms of heteroleptic 
d0 molecules.    

 

 

4. Discussion: LICCs and the Structures of TM Compounds 

Overview. In a recent review of non-VSEPR structures, Kaupp pointed out that a complex interplay 

of four factors is responsible for the formation of structures which obey or violate the predictions of 

the  VSEPR  model:[14b]  in  summary,  core  polarization  and  d-orbital  participation  in  σ-bonding 

disfavor  VSEPR  arrangements,  whereas  ligand  repulsion  and  π-bonding  encourage  such 

arrangements.  Kaupp  concluded  that  the  structural  influence  of  π-bonding  is  rather  difficult  to 

assess, since it depends not only on the π-donor capacity of the ligands, but also in a complex way 

on  the  valence  angle  subtended  by  these  ligands  at  the  central  atom.  Furthermore,  the  type  of  π-

bonding  (viz.  in-plane  or  out-of-plane)  must  be  identified  in  order  to  analyze  its  effects.  To 

complicate  matters  yet  further,  the  structural  influence  of  π-bonding  was  found  to  depend  on  the 
coordination  number  of  the  metal  center.[14a]  Within  this  rather  labyrinthine  situation,  calculations 
may be reliable in prediction but are, as pointed out by Seppelt,[51] rather opaque of expression in 

simple  physical  terms.  Accordingly,  there  is  a  compelling  need  to  extend  a  readily  understood 

model,  such  as  VSEPR,  so  as  to  accommodate  the  various  factors  clearly,  consistently,  and 

faithfully. 

Such an extension was in fact proposed by Gillespie et al. in 1996[52] and refined by Bader, 
Gillespie  and  Martin  (BGM)  in  1998.[23]  BGM  proposed  that  a  heavy  central  atom  may  be 

susceptible  to  ligand-induced  polarization  of  the  outer  shell  of  the  core  –  termed  the  “effective 

valence  shell”.  These  authors  further  concluded  that  the  Laplacian  of  the  charge  density,  ∇2ρ(r), 
can be used to localize LICCs[53] as a signature of the local polarization of the central atom. They 

also found that the more covalent a metal-ligand bond, the larger is the trans-LICC induced at M 

diametrically opposed to it. In the BGM approach, LICCs, along with bonding CCs (BCCs) and the 

ligands themselves, each make spatial demands at the central atom; the global resolution of these 

leads  to  the  lowest  energy  conformation  that  may  or  may  not  agree  with  the  predictions  of  the 

simple VSEPR theory. However, there has been no consensus on this point or on other simplified 

11 

explanations[51,54]  that  have  been  advanced,  since  the  precise  significance  of  the  LICCs  has 
remained  unclear.  Not  without  reason  Seppelt  has  contended[51]  that  these  features  have  not  been 

observed experimentally and are merely the creatures of sophisticated computational methods.   

Here we demonstrate a solution to these inadequacies. In a study by Scherer and McGrady in 

2003, the existence of pronounced LICCs was confirmed experimentally for a TM alkyl complex, 
and their origin was traced to covalent metal-ligand bond formation employing metal d-orbitals.[24] 

In a search for further support of the extended VSEPR model, we have analyzed the wavefunctions 

of the present molecules Me3NbCl2 and Me2NbCl3 by a combined study employing both MO- and 

charge-density-based methods.  

The  nature  and  origin  of  LICCs.  We  first  consider  the  simplest  model  system  which  displays 
covalent bonding between a TM and a ligand, viz. CaH+. The charge density contours of the natural 

bond orbital (NBO) representing the σ(Ca–H) bond are depicted in Figure 4 in juxtaposition to the 

σ-bonding NBO of its main group congener MgH+. According to an NBO analysis, the Ca–H bond 
shows  20.2%  metal  character,  indicative  of  significant  covalent  bonding  employing  sd0.67 
2-character). The overall p-type contribution 

hybridization at the Ca atom (59.6% 4s- and 40.0% 3dz
amounts  to  a  mere  0.4%  for  the  σ(Ca–H)  NBO  making  CaH+  the  simplest  and  therefore  optimal 
testbed for analyzing the origin and nature of LICCs in d0 TM compounds.  

In Figure 5a,b the total charge densities,  ρ(r), of MgH+ and CaH+  are  shown  as  relief  maps 

which  reveal  hardly  any  features  hinting  at  significant  metal  polarization.  In  the  case  of  the  TM 

model, CaH+, however, the Laplacian of the charge density, ∇2ρ(r), displays clearly a polarization 

of  the  metal  center[55]  in  the  profile  of  ∇2ρ(r)  along  the  Ca–H  bond  (Figure  5d),  and  also  in  the 

corresponding relief map and isosurface map at a constant ∇2ρ(r)-value of –71.0 eÅ–5 (Figure 5f). 

Hence the Laplacian as a localization function reveals a BCC at the Ca atom facing the hydrogen 

ligand,  and  a  trans-LICC  diametrically  opposed  to  this.  In  addition  to  these  two  charge 

concentrations, a third one forming a belt around the Ca atom is denoted cis-LICC. According to the 

NBO analysis, any contribution by natural p-AO functions to the σ(Ca–H) NBO is marginal. Hence 

the ligand-induced quadrupolar polarization of the cation must be directly related to the contribution 

of the 3dz2 AO to the total charge density. This can be demonstrated in greater detail by analysis of 

the individual contribution of the σ(Ca–H) NBO to the total charge density: the Laplacian of the σ-
NBO  density  contours  (Figure  4c-f)[56]  of  our  models  CaH+  and  MgH+  reveals  all  the  essential 

features that characterize the nature of the LICCs, as set out below.  

         (i) All three or four quantum shells of the Mg and Ca atoms, respectively, are resolved in the 

∇2ρ(r)-relief map of the charge density of the corresponding σ-NBOs. Closer inspection of Figures 

4e,f  shows  the  M-shell  of  the  Mg  cation  and  the  N-shell  of  Ca  cation  to  be  rather  indistinct,  in 

12 

agreement with the relatively diffuse character of the 3s and 4s atomic functions, and the cationic 
nature of both metals in MgH+ and CaH+. As a consequence, this weak undulation is damped out in 

the  Laplacian  of  the  total  charge  density.  Accordingly,  only  three  shells  are  resolved  for  the  Ca 

atom  when  the  total  charge  density  is  analyzed  (Figure  5).  In  this  respect,  Ca  shows  the  same 

incomplete shell structure as a regular transargonic element: the (n–1) quantum shell is not revealed 

in  the  Laplacian.  Nevertheless,  careful  analysis  of  the  Laplacian  along  the  Ca–H  directrix  still 

reveals a point of inflection (Figure 5d). This point coincides with the region of the fourth quantum 

shell,  when  only  the  charge  density  contribution  of  the  σ-NBO  of  CaH+  is  taken  into  account. 
Hence  it  may  be  considered  the  residual  echo  of  the  fourth  quantum  shell  of  Ca.[57]  This  result 

clearly underlines the success of our concept for analysis not only of the total charge density, ρ(r), 

but also of  its  individual contributions to the underlying NBOs. Hence, partitioning of the charge 

density  via  the  NBO  methods  appears  to  provide  a  new  and  detailed  insight  into  the  electronic 

structures of compounds.  

         (ii)  As  a  by-product  of  this  approach,  we  can  now  visualize  how  the  ligand  in  each  of  our 
benchmark  systems  induces  a  clear  polarization  of  the  inner  core  shells  of  the  metal.  In  MgH+ 

(Figures  4c,e),  the  charge  concentration  of  the  L-shell  is  clearly  polarized  toward  the  hydrogen 

ligand: the ligand-opposed rear side of the L-shell of charge concentrations is substantially depleted. 
In  the  case  of  the  more  covalent  CaH+,[58]  the  core  polarization  is  even  more  pronounced:  the 

corresponding rear side of the L-shell of charge concentration in Figure 4f is completely depleted, 

and displays a positive value of ∇2ρ(r). The remaining polarization features can now be assigned to 

the remnants of the N shell (denoted by a broken line) and the characteristic polarization pattern of 

the  M  shell  which  is  less  pronounced  but  still  recovered  in  the  global  polarization  pattern  of  the 

total  charge  density  of  CaH+  (Figure  5f).  According  to  the  character  of  the  σ-NBO  of  CaH+  – 

composed of 4s and 3dz2 NAOs at the Ca atom – the existence of the BCC and LICC in the M-shell 

of charge concentration at the Ca atom can now be clearly ascribed to the contribution of the 3dz2 

NAO function at Ca (Figure 5f). As a consequence, it is the nodal structure of the 3dz2 NAO which 

is ultimately responsible for the formation of the diffuse belt denoted cis-LICC, as well as for the 

BCC and the trans-LICC, and hence for the quadrupolar polarization of the Ca cation (Figure 5f). 

Most  chemists  concur  that  the  4s  and  3d  orbitals  of  a  first-row  TM  are  its  valence  orbitals. 

Accordingly,  we  prefer  to  avoid  the  potentially  confusing  terms  “core  charge  concentrations”  or 
“charge concentrations of the outermost core” introduced by Gillespie[20,52] and Bader[22,50] and to 

use instead “valence shell charge concentrations”, or simply “charge concentrations” (CC), for both 

main-group and TM compounds.  

         (iii) In the final step of our analysis, we consider whether the pronounced trans-LICC seen in 
CaH+  might  arise  from  use  of  Ca  p  functions  in  the  bonding.  To  address  this  question,  we  have 

13 

analyzed the electronic situation in the lighter congener MgH+ (Figures 4c,e). The NBO of MgH+ 

can  be  classified  as  a  σ(Mg–H)  bonding  orbital  with  the  characteristics  typical  of  a  main-group 

hydride (97.7% s- and 2.3% p-character at the Mg cation). In contrast to its heavier congener, the 

polarization  at  the  metal  is  now  solely  accomplished  by  p-functions,  which  induce  dipolar  rather 

than  quadrupolar  polarization  of  the  metal  cation,  and  thus  create  a  more  ionic  Mg–H  bond  in 
comparison  with  CaH+.  As  a  result,  charge  density  is  no  longer  concentrated  trans  to  the  Mg–H 

bond,  and  no  LICC  can  be  observed  (Figure  4e).  This  example  clearly  illustrates  that  it  is  the 

different  nodal  structures  of  p  and  d  wavefunctions  that  give  rise  to  the  different  polarization 

patterns  at  the  metal  center.  It  thus  tallies  with  valence  bond  arguments  outlined  by  Firman  and 
Landis[59]  in  accounting  for  the  disfavor  for  valence  angles  of  180o  typically  displayed  by  TM 

compounds  containing  strong  σ-bonding  ligands.  Figures  6a,b  show  the  deformation  densities  of 
MgH+ and CaH+ in support of our conclusion: in the case of the second short period metal Mg, a 

dipolar  polarization  is  observed,  while  the  first  long  period  metal  Ca  displays  quadrupolar 

polarization.  Figure  6  elegantly  reveals  therefore  the  fundamental  difference  between  these  two 

metals that may be traced to the ability of Ca to form sd-hybrid orbitals.  
         In the next section we will demonstrate that it is this greater orbital flexibility that allows d0 

TM compounds to adopt non-VSEPR structures. Our partitioning of the total charge density in the 
benchmark systems CaH+ and MgH+ using the NBO method may then offer the last word in a long 

and  controversial  debate  on  the  nature  and  origin  of  local  charge  concentrations  at  TM  centers. 

These concentrations arise from polarization of the valence electrons, and are induced by covalently 

bonded  σ-  and  π-ligands.  They  are  an  integral  part  of  the  bonds  formed  using  metal  orbitals 

possessing d-character. It is not surprising therefore that they contain all the information necessary 

to refine the VSEPR model without increasing its complexity. 

The  non-VSEPR  geometries  of  Me3NbCl2  and  Me2NbCl3.  In  the  case  of  simple  diatomic 
molecules like CaH+ or MgH+, dissection of the charge density was straightforward since the effect 

of the covalent M–H bonding on the total charge density could be attributed to a single NBO. We 

now show that a similar partitioning of the charge density into the individual contributions of all the 

σ-type  NBOs  can  be  applied  to  more  complex  TM  compounds.    In  the  case  of  Me3NbCl2  and 

Me2NbCl3,  all  σ(Nb–C)  and  σ(Nb–Cl)  NBOs  have  been    analyzed  with  respect  to  formation  of 

valence shell charge concentrations at the Nb atom.  

As  shown  in  Figure  7,  all  σ-type  NBOs  formed  by  the  chloro  and  methyl  ligands  in 

Me2NbCl3 resemble the σ-type NBO in CaH+. The charge density in the Ca–H bonding domain of 

CaH+ resulted mainly from the overlap between the 1s AO of hydrogen and the 4s and 3dz2 NAOs 

of the metal. In Me3NbCl2 and Me2NbCl3, bonding is mainly established by the 5s and 4d orbitals at 

14 

the metal and 2p  or  3p orbitals  at  the  carbon or chlorine atoms, respectively. Hence the origin of 
LICCs  in  these  systems  is  similar  to  that  in  CaH+:  they  arise  from  the  characteristic  shape  and 
symmetry of  a  d  orbital.[60] The Laplacian of the total charge density of Me2NbCl3 (Figure 8b) is 

approximately  composed  of  the  sum  of  the  individual  σ-(NBOs)  shown  in  Figures  7d-f  (see 

Supporting Material). 

We note further that BCCs at TM atoms are typically weakly – if at all – pronounced in the 

Laplacian of the total charge density. In the case of Me3NbCl2 and Me2NbCl3, which display rather 

polarized metal-ligand bonds, no BCCs at all can be located. As a result, only the pronounced trans-

LICCs  of  the  individual  ligands  dominate  as  maxima  or  (3,–3)  critical  points  in  the  negative 

Laplacian  of  the  polarization  pattern  at  niobium  (Figure  8).    We  conclude  that  the  polarization 

pattern  of  Me2NbCl3  is  consonant  with  the  picture  emerging  from  our  NBO  analysis  of  the 

molecule.  

Figures 8a,b show the envelope maps of the Laplacian at –∇2ρ(r) = 40 eÅ–5 around the central 

niobium  atom  of  Me3NbCl2  and  Me2NbCl3  each  at  the  optimized  geometry.  In  accord  with  the 
results of BGM for Me2TiCl2,[23] the trans-LICCs induced by the methyl ligands, LICC(C), are in 

each case significantly larger than those arising from the chloro ligands, LICC(Cl). Hence it is the 

more  covalent  Nb–C  bonds  rather  than  the  more  ionic  Nb–Cl  bonds  that  give  rise  to  the  more 

pronounced LICCs. These charge concentrations are not merely polarizations of the metal valence 

shell then, but can be regarded as signatures of the covalent bonding. In principle, they even offer a 

basis for ligand (L) classification according to its capacity to form strong M–L σ-bonds.   

The  polarization  of  the  metal  atom  valence  shell  in  the  superficially  more  straightforward 

Me3NbCl2  is  therefore  dominated  by  the  three  pronounced  trans-LICCs  induced  by  the  methyl 

groups. As a consequence, these groups adopt with the metal atom an array which is displaced by 

0.083  Å  from  a  strictly  trigonal  planar  configuration,  a  scenario  that  results  in  C–Nb–C  valence 
angles  of  119.9o,  close  to  the  optimal  value  of  120°  for  the  three  LICC(C)  features.  The  axial 

positions in Me3NbCl2 are then occupied by the two chloro ligands; these are mutually destabilized 

by  the  LICC(Cl)  features  induced  trans  to  each  Nb–Cl  bond.  Hence  the  axial  positions  are 

energetically less favorable and are occupied – as predicted in the simple VSEPR model – by the 

ligands which i) have a reduced charge density in the M–L bonding region, and ii) induce a smaller 

charge concentration. 

The  slight  deviation  from  planarity  of  the  NbC3  skeleton  and  inequality  of  the  axial  Nb–Cl 

bonds  characterize  the C3v  model  of  the  molecule  which  is  predicted  by  the  calculations  to  be  its 

equilibrium ground state. The magnitudes of the LICCs are essentially the same for the C3h as for 

the C3v model, but the locations differ, with the preference for the C3v model arising from Pauli-type 

repulsion  between  the  Nb–C  bonding  electron  pair  domain  and  the  LICC(C)s.  As  a  consequence, 

15 

the three methyl ligands and the three LICC(C)s adopt the form of a very shallow trigonal antiprism 

rather than a planar hexagon. Such a distortion has already been identified on the basis of IR spectra 
for non-VSEPR molecules such as LnMe3 (Ln = Sc, Y, or La),[61] which apparently display a more 

pronouncedly pyramidal MC3 unit than is forecast for Me3NbCl2. The chloro ligands could thus be 

seen  as  inhibiting  further  pyramidalization  of  the  NbMe3  unit  i)  by  interligand  repulsion  between 

the Nb–Cl and Nb–C bonding electron pair domains, and ii) by repulsion arising from the presence 

of the LICC(C)s.  

Whether  Pauli  repulsion  (favoring  C3v  or  C3  symmetry)  overcomes  interligand  repulsion 

(favoring C3h symmetry) in practice we are unable to judge. However, if Pauli repulsion dominates, 

we are now able to predict the distortion coordinate (C3h → C3v) on the potential energy surface of 

the free molecule. Whatever the true equilibrium structure may be, the energy difference between 

the C3h and C3v forms is probably smaller than the zero point energy associated with the three CH3 

rotational modes, implying virtually unhindered internal rotation of the CH3 groups in the gaseous 

molecule.  

In the case of Me2NbCl3 (Figure 8b), the situation is more complex. Here we have to consider 

two different types of chloro ligand, and the molecular symmetry is reduced to C2v. Once again, the 

LICCs induced trans to the methyl ligands are significantly larger than those trans to the axial Nb–

Cl bonds; these in turn are larger than the trans-LICC induced by the equatorial chloro ligand, with 

the  result  that  the  third  CC,  LICC(Cl)  in  the  equatorial  plane  of  the  molecule,  is  significantly 
smaller (ca. 45 eÅ–5) than both the LICC(C)s. Hence the largest repulsion is expected between the 

M–C bond domains and the LICC(C)s. As a direct consequence, a ∠CMC angle smaller than 120° 

is predicted and observed, in contrast to the expectations of the classical VSEPR model. In a similar 

manner, the axial positions of the chlorine ligands are dictated by the dominant repulsion between 

the M–Cl bond domain [ρ(M–Cl)] and the LICC(C)s. This situation leads to a ∠ClaxNbCleq greater 

than  90°,  as  observed  by  experiment  [96.5(6)°]  and  theory  [98.5°].  Hence  the  extended  VSEPR 
concept proposed by BGM[23] accommodates the structure of Me2NbCl3. It is important therefore to 

expose  the  physical  basis  of  this  concept,  and  to  test  its  general  applicability  to  pentacoordinate 

compounds with unusual geometries. 

In the final step of our analysis, a relaxed potential-energy surface (PES) scan with a varying  

ClaxNbCleq angle was carried out to explore  how distortions away from the equilibrium geometry 
affect the topology of the charge density (Table 5). Figures 8c,d show isosurface plots of ∇2ρ(r) at 

the values of ∠ClaxNbCleq = 90 and 83°, respectively. Optimal bond distances and valence angles 

obtained  by  a  relaxed  scan  over  ∠ClaxNbCleq  are  also  listed  in  Table  5  along  with  the  absolute 

values of the LICCs obtained for each optimized geometry. The magnitude of the LICC(C)s – and 

to a lesser extent the LICC(Clax)s – decrease monotonically with increasing ∠ClaxNbCleq, whereas 

16 

that of the LICC(Cleq) remains relatively constant. The potential energy of Me2NbCl3 as a function 

of  ∠ClaxNbCleq  is  depicted  in  the  Supporting  Material.  The  molecule  becomes  destabilized  more 

rapidly  by  distortion  of  the  equilibrium  geometry  toward  a  smaller  ClaxNbCleq  angle  than  by 

distortion toward a larger angle. This provides further evidence for the structure-determining role of 

the LICC(C)s, since smaller ClaxNbCleq angles lead to a tighter CMC angle and thus a closing of the 

angle formed by the corresponding LICC(C)s. Consequently the repulsion between both LICC(C)s 

leads to an increase of the total energy on reducing the ClaxNbCleq angle. In contrast, a widening of 

∠ClaxNbCleq leads to both a larger CMC angle and a larger angle between the LICC(C)s. Thus, the 

dominating  repulsion  between  the  LICC(C)s  is  reduced  along  this  coordinate,  though  it  is  still 

overcompensated by increased repulsion between the Nb–C bonding electrons and the LICC(C)s, as 

signaled by significantly elongated Nb–C bonds. 

In  summary,  the  observed  and  calculated  equilibrium  structures  of  Me2NbCl3  and  
 
Me3NbCl2 are easily rationalized by taking into account the polarization of the d0 metal center, with 

Pauli repulsion between the dominant CCs induced by the covalent M–C bonds turning out to be 

the critical structure-determining factor. 

 

 

5. Conclusions 

 

The  TBP  structures  of  Me2NbCl3  (C2v)  and  Me3NbCl2  have  been  confirmed  experimentally 

and  theoretically,  although  the  overall  symmetry  of  the  latter  molecule  in  its  equilibrium  ground 

state  could  not  be  established  unequivocally.  However,  the  X-ray  model  for  Me3NbCl2  clearly 

indicates a slightly distorted TBP structure which does not conform with the VSEPR model but is in 

close  agreement  with  the  results  of  DFT  calculations  that  suggest  a  C3v  geometry  for  the 

equilibrium  ground  state  of  the  molecule,  with  one  C–H  bond  of  each  CH3  group  eclipsing  a 

common  axial  Nb–Cl  bond  and  rendering  the  Nb–Cl  bonds  inequivalent.  The  structure  of 

Me2NbCl3 also deviates from the predictions of the simple VSEPR model in that the expected C2v 

geometry features axial Nb–Cl bonds that are bent away from rather than toward the equatorial Nb–

Cl bond. 

Topological  analysis  of  total  electron  densities  using  ∇2ρ(r)  as  an  electron  localization 

function reveals tiny but important features of the seemingly featureless total electron density, ρ(r), 

and  provides  a  wealth  of  information  on  the  polarization  of  charge  in  complex  systems  such  as 

these. Analysis of the total charge density shows ligand-induced charge concentrations (LICCs) at 

the Nb atom to account for the non-VSEPR structures adopted, certainly by Me2NbCl3 and probably 

by  Me3NbCl2.  In  particular,  the  significant  bending  of  Nb–Clax  bonds  toward  the  C–Nb–C 

equatorial unit in Me2NbCl3 may be rationalized in terms of the mutual repulsion between bonded 

17 

and ligand-opposed CCs present in the valence shell of Nb, in agreement with the extended VSEPR 
model  suggested  by  BGM.[23]  However,  the  conventional  AIM-based  approach  for  topological 

analysis of the total electron density is restricted to the evaluation of "local" topological parameters 

at  so-called  critical  points.  This  is  a  severe  limitation,  since  LICCs  induced  by  different  ligands 

appear to have different local, as well as non-local, properties, such as shape and size. Since it is the 

entire  distribution  of  charge  in  space  that  determines  the  equilibrium  geometry  of  a  molecule, 

further insight into the spatial distribution of electron density may be gained by analyzing non-local 

properties of the charge density, such as envelope maps of the -∇2ρ(r) function. As a result of this 

sort  of  analysis,  the  rather  unusual  structure  of  Me2NbCl3  appears  to  derive  primarily  from 

repulsion  between  the  Nb–Clax  bonding  electron  density  and  the  LICCs  associated  with  the 

equatorial  Nb–C  bonds;  the  interactions  between  the  Nb–Clax  bonds  and  their  mutually  disposed 

LICCs appear to be less important. 

An  important  outcome  of  our  study  is  the  first  identification  of  a  powerful  approach  that 

explains  the  nature  and  occurrence  of  LICCs  by  a  direct  and  rigorous  interpretation  of  the 

wavefunction.  All  information  about  the  origin  of  LICCs  is  directly  accessible  from  the 

wavefunction via the natural bond orbital (NBO) method. In the first step of our approach, we use 

the  NBO  method  to  partition  the  total  charge  density  in  a  physically  meaningful  way  into  its 
individual  core  and  valence  density  contributions.[62]  The  valence  density  is  thus  unequivocally 
represented by the superposition of bonding NBOs, in agreement with the Lewis concept.[56]  In the 

next step, we demonstrate that all polarization features in the Laplacian of the total charge density 

are  composed  of  the  individual  contributions  from  bonding  NBOs.  In  the  final  step,  the  NBO 

analysis allows us to conclude that LICCs arise from polarization of the valence shell of a transition 

metal center, and are induced by covalently σ− and π–bonded ligands. They are an integral part of 

the  bonds  formed  using  metal  orbitals  possessing  d-character.  It  is  then  the  different  nodal 

structures of p and d-wavefunctions that give rise to different atomic polarization patterns at main 

group  metals  and  transition  metals.  Our  study  thus  validates  the  earlier  suggestion  made  by 
Szentpály  and  Schwerdtfeger,[63]  that  polarization  of  a  metal  center  and  simultaneous  d-orbital 

contribution are not different but rather two sides of the same coin, since it is the subvalence (n-1)d 

orbitals that are responsible for the polarization of the metal core.

Graphical abstract. 

 

 

Ligand-induced charge concentrations (LICCs) are shown to cause the non-VSEPR structures 
determined by experiment and calculation for the heteroleptic d0 transition-metal alkyls Me3NbCl2 

and Me2NbCl3. The Natural Bond Order (NBO) method is employed to partition the total charge 

density in a physically meaningful way, and we demonstrate for the first time that all information 
about the origin of LICCs in d0 transition-metal compounds is directly accessible through the 

wavefunction.  LICCs arise naturally as part of an M–X bond in which metal d-functions are 

involved, and a sound chemical and physical basis is outlined for their occurrence at a transition-

metal center.

Kohn-Sham method employed in our study at the B3LYP/DZVP level is based on a fictitious 

reference system on non-interacting electrons (the non-interacting system), so that there is no 

DF wavefunction in a strict sense. However, it could be demonstrated that Kohn-Sham orbitals 

resemble orbitals computed at the Hartree-Fock level; see Ref. [14a] for further information. 

Hence they can be employed here in our qualitative MO discussions employing the NBO 

concept. See also: a) E. J. Baerends, O. V. Gritsenko, J. Phys. Chem. A 1997, 101, 5383-5403;

43 The calculated unit cell for the optimized solid state structure of Me3NbCl2 deviates only 

slightly from the experimental lattice vectors which were used as starting translational vectors in 

the PBC calculation: a = 7.99 [7.44] Å, b = 7.79 [7.44] Å, c = 8.83 [8.11] Å, α = 89.9 [90]°, β = 

90.1 [90]°, γ = 120.8 [120]°; experimental lattice parameters are specified in brackets. 

Furthermore, the orientation and local symmetry of both optimized Me3NbCl2 molecules/unit 

cell was found to be in close agreement with the space group P63mc of our experimental model. 

Due to the clearly resolved pyramidalization of the Me3Nb fragment in both independently 

optimized Me3NbCl2 molecules the P63/mmc supergroup of  P63mc can be ruled out. The same 

is true for the t2 subgroup P31c of P63mc since the averaged orientation of the methyl groups 

does not significantly deviate from the overall molecular C3v symmetry.

49 The small CNbC angle of 114(2)° is not reproduced by our DFT calculations at the 

B3LYP/DZVP level of theory (121.0°). This might be due to the fact that all bond distances 

between the central Nb atom and the ligand atoms (C and Cl) are clearly overestimated in the 

calculations. Hence ligand-induced polarization of the central metal might be significantly 

underestimated in the DFT model. In the following section it is shown that these effects are 

mainly responsible for the geometric distortions observed in Me2NbCl3 which in turn might be 

the origin of the discrepancies between experiment and theory. However, the trend of the 

calculations is also clear: analysis of the potential energy surface (PES) at variable values of the 

angle ClaxNbCleq (α) shows already at α = 93° a CNbC angle smaller than 120° (118.4°) 

implying a non-VSEPR geometry for Me2NbCl3. However, selection of basis sets of larger 

flexibility in valence space or choice of more appropriate theoretical models to account for the 

electron correlation leads to much better agreement between experimental and calculated 

structural parameters. E.g. employing the CCSD method and relpacing our standard DZVP basis 

set at the niobium atom by the Stuttgart relativistic, small core ECP basis set (D. Andrae, U. 

Haeussermann, M. Dolg, H. Stoll, H. Preuss, Theor. Chim. Acta 1990, 77, 123-141) results in an 

CNbC angle of (118.7°) in much better agreement with experiment; see Supporting Material 

S6c for further calculations.

53 Where necessary, we will denote hereafter these ligand-induced charge concentrations trans-

LICCs or cis-LICCs with respect to their location in the valence shell of the metal and to the 

corresponding metal-ligand bonding domains.

55 We compute a quadrupolar polarization of the atomic charge distribution with respect to the z-

axis (along the Ca-H bon), Qzz, of -1.5 DebyeÅ for the Ca atom in MeCa+. 

56 Our test calculations indicated that an additional contribution to the valence density from the 

superposition of partially occupied antibonding NBOs was irrelevant for the polarization pattern 

31 

                                                                                                                                                                  

at the TM atom (see Supporting Material). 

57 This is not a major complication or drawback with the Laplacian function. In any event, the 

essential features of the charge density, namely the localization of valence charge 

concentrations, are sufficiently revealed by the Laplacian of the total charge density. 

58 Topological parameters of the total charge densities at the Mg-H and Ca-H BCPs are ρ(r) = 

0.37 eÅ–3,  ∇2ρ(r) = 3.60 eÅ–5 and ρ(r) = 0.47 eÅ–3,  ∇2ρ(r) = 1.48 eÅ–5, respectively, which 

stress the more covalent character of the Ca-H bond.

60 In these benchmark systems, however, the symmetry and shape of the metal-centered orbitals is 
made more complex than in CaH+ by the admixture of other d-orbitals which display two nodal 

planes (dx2–y2, dxy, dxz, dyz) instead of two conical nodal planes as in the natural dz2-type AO. 

61 Matrix-isolated ScH3 has been shown to be almost planar, with ∠HScH = 119.2°, cf. YH3 

(113.8°) and LaH3 (108.8°) – X. Wang, G. V. Chertihin, L. Andrews, J. Phys. Chem. A 2002, 

106, 9213-9225. Quantum chemical calculations predict a D3h structure for ScH3 – N. B.

62 The AIM method provides an elegant concept to partition the total charge density in real space 

by zero-flux surfaces into atomic basins. This is different from our approach were the individual 

contribution of natural bonding orbitals (NBOs) to the total charge density is analyzed. Hence, 

according to the suggestions of one of our referees the differences between both approaches 

could be further specified as partitioning in real space (AIM method) versus partitioning in 

Hilbert space (NBO method). Indeed, the NBOs are one sequence of natural localized orbital 

sets that include atomic (NAO), hybrid (NHO), and (semi)localized molecular orbital (NLMO) 

sets intermediate between basis atomic orbitals (AOs) and delocalized molecular orbitals 

(MOs): AOs -> NAOs -> NHOs -> NBOs -> NLMOs -> MOs. All these natural localized sets 

are complete and orthonormal, able to exactly describe any property of the state function, Ψ, in 

Hilbert space (see F. Weinhold, C. R. Landis, Chem. Educ. Res. Pract. Eur. 2001, 2, 91-104). 

As a consequence, the complete set of bonding and antibonding NBOs can be employed to 

expand the electron density ρ(r) of Ψ in a highly compact way similar to the features of natural 

orbitals (NOs) introduced 1955 by Löwdin (see P.-O. Löwdin, Phys. Rev. 1955, 97, 1474-1489).

Abstract 

We  discuss  semiempirical  approaches  and  parametric  methods  developed  for  modeling 

molecular  vibronic  spectra.  These  methods,  together  with  databases  of  molecular  fragments,  have 

proved  efficient  and  flexible  for  solving  various  problems  ranging  from  detailed  interpretation  of 

conventional  vibronic  spectra  and  calculation  of  radiative  transition  probabilities  to  direct 

simulations  of  dynamical  (time-resolved)  spectra  and  spectrochemical  analysis  of  individual 

substances and mixtures. A number of specific examples and applications presented here show the 

potential of the semiempirical approach for predictive calculations of spectra and solution of inverse 

spectral  problems.  It  is  noteworthy  that  these  advances  provide  computational  insights  into 

developing  theories  of  photoinduced  isomer  transformations  and  nonradiative  transitions  in 

polyatomic molecules and molecular ensembles, theory of new methods for standardless quantitative 

spectral analysis.  

Introduction 

Polyatomic  molecules,  supramolecules  and  molecular  associates  can  exchange  information 

and transfer energy through collisions and chemical reactions, and also through elementary acts such 

as  absorption,  emission  or  scattering  of  electromagnetic  waves.  Beyond  trivial  absorption  and 

consecutive spontaneous emission, these rather complicated processes may result in and be used for 

irreversible  photochemical  transformations  of  molecular  structure;  creating  an  inverted  population, 

data storage; and pattern recognition [1-4] at the molecular level. These peculiarities of objects from 

the  world  of  molecules  make  this  world  very  attractive for studies and design  of new materials or 

drugs,  molecular  devices  [5-9],  fundamentally  new  electronic  components  for  computers  and 

communication systems.

However, it is quite clear that purely empirical work along these lines, even if supported by 

brute-force ab initio calculations, will be difficult or even impossible. This is due to the sheer size 

and high dimensionality of realistic systems. It therefore seems reasonable that further progress will 

rely heavily on investigative computer simulations and experiments. A number of easily adjustable 

molecular  models  and  computational  methods  come  from  the  theory  of  vibrational  and  vibronic 

spectra whose “speciality” is basically finding energy levels and transition probabilities for complex 

molecular systems subjected to various perturbations and external fields. For this reason, advances in 

theoretical molecular spectroscopy and its methods, which may seem far from being able to describe 

processes any more complicated than basic absorption or emission of radiation, ultimately determine 

and  spur  the  development  of  other  closely  related  chapters,  such  as  quantum  chemistry  of  large 

(bio)molecules. Further, and this is more important, prognostic capabilities of the theory of spectra 

can be most easily tested experimentally – in this sense simulations of spectra give one the shortest 

bridge  from  molecular  models  to  observed  quantities;  for  this  reason  theoretical  spectroscopy  has 

been  long  used  in  studies  of  structure  and  reactivity  of  polyatomic  molecules  in  their  ground  and 

excited states.  

As is believed natural for any theoretical generalization claiming to provide a description of 

complex  systems,  practical  applications  immediately  manifest  the  principle  of  complementarity 

introduced by Niels Bohr. Theory of spectra originates from rigorous quantum mechanical concepts 

and approaches, but from the other hand — it relies on an appropriate choice and parameterization of 

a particular molecular model that inevitably implies semi-empirical treatment of a problem at hand. 

This  occurs  primarily  in  pursuing  clarity  when  one  wishes  to  develop  a  language  for  describing 

complex objects. But still the other side of the coin is that a purely “mathematical solution” might 

give  results  that  would  be  hard  to  interpret  and  compare  with  an  experiment.  A  good  illustration 

comes  from  quantum  chemistry  where  one  just  cannot  find  rigorous  proofs  for  some  fundamental 

concepts ranging from convergence of the self-consistent field procedure, the idea of LCAO all the 

way down to the choice of Gaussian basis sets. 

A  comprehensive  approach  to  the  problems  in  the  theory  of  spectra  with  special  emphasis 

paid to practical aspects has been pursued in a series of monographs by one of the authors and his 

colleagues [10-17]. This article is intended as a sequel and further development of the circle of ideas 

introduced there.  

Here  we  will  use  the  Born-Oppenheimer  adiabatic  approximation;  hence  the  vibrational 

structure  of  a  spectrum  can  be  understood,  e.g.,  quantitatively  in  terms  of  differences  between 

ground state and excited state potential energy surfaces (PES). Significant progress in this field gave 

rise to new quite accurate and efficient methods for computing all the matrix elements [16, 18-20].

Thus, the central problem of adiabatic theory of spectra reduces now to the problem of how to obtain 

changes in geometry and force constants occurring upon electronic excitation. It is worth noting here 

that  for  polyatomic  molecules  these  differences  in PES are  typically  small (of  the  order  of several 

percent), so appropriate methods should be employed to achieve spectroscopic accuracy. 

 

Existing  approaches  make it  possible to  perform direct calculations of spectra for adiabatic 

molecular  models,  achieving  good  quantitative  agreement  with  experiment  (see,  for  example,  [14, 

15, 21-24]). This is not only a window into interpretation of spectral experiment, but it also leads to 

refinement of models through solution of inverse problems [25]. 

However, the level of adiabatic theory that has been achieved so far, and questions that have 

arisen, suggest that further development is necessary, perhaps, mainly with the aim to improve the 

system of parameters and extend computational methods in accord with experiments. Here we refer 

primarily to high resolution laser spectroscopy in supersonic jets, experimental techniques based on 

dispersed  single  vibronic  level  fluorescence  spectra  [26-38]  and,  especially,  the  exponentially 

growing  field  of  time-resolved  spectroscopy  with  closely  related  modern  femto-sciences  — 

femtochemistry and femtobiology [39-46]. All this provides strong motivation for the development 

of corresponding theoretical methods and predictive molecular models. 

1. The system of parameters for adiabatic molecular model in the theory of vibronic 

spectra 

As the experimental techniques have developed and new methods came into play, the role of 

detailed,  accurate  and,  more  importantly,  predictive  calculations  of  vibronic  spectra  have  become 

principle  in  the  studies  of  structural  and  spectroscopic  properties  of  polyatomic  molecules.  Due  to 

quite general reasons, but not just because of lack of computational resources, much progress in this 

field is to be expected from parametric semiempirical methods supplied with databases of molecular 

fragments  and  physically  meaningful  systems  of  parameters.  The  possibility  of  such  theory  for 

adiabatic  molecular  models  was  first  discussed  in  [47]  and  found  further  development  in  [48-50]. 

The basic idea is to describe PES of the molecule in terms of two groups of parameters — first and 

second  derivatives  of  Coulomb  and  resonance  one-electron  integrals  in  the  basis  of  hybridized 

atomic  orbitals  (HAO)  with  respect  to  natural  coordinates  (the  first  derivatives  are  responsible  for 

changes  in  geometry  of  a  molecule,  while  the  second  —  for  changes  in  force  constants).  The 

important point also is that these parameters are the same for different electronic states.  

In the framework of the parametric approach, most of analytical expressions for changes in 

PES upon electronic excitation can be significantly simplified by retaining only the leading diagonal 

terms.  This  along  with  characteristic  structure  of  changes  in  electron  density  matrix,  pronounced

local properties of the derivatives and ranking by their absolute values, makes the number of these 

parameters  just  small,  whereas  transferability  of  parameters  in  homologous  series  and  optimal 

semiempirical  choice  of  their  specific  values  for  certain  molecular  fragments  have  provided  a 

reasonable basis for direct calculations of one-photon absorption and fluorescence vibronic spectra 

and  properties  of  excited  states.  The  use  of  molecular  fragments  is  essential,  providing  that 

calibration  of  model  parameters  can  be  done  for  small  molecules  and  one  type  of  experiment 

(conventional  absorption  or  fluorescence).  Models  of  complex  compounds  can  then  be  built  from 

these  fragments  (pre-stored  in  databases  [48-53])  and  used  for  simulations  of  spectra  either  of  the 

same or of the other type. Such approach has been applied to extend existing parametric methods to 

the  case  of  time-resolved  vibronic  spectra,  which  —  having  one  extra  dimension—  contain  more 

spectroscopic  information.  We  shall  address  this  issue  and  summarize  our  results  on  direct 

simulations of dynamical spectra in section 3. 

In  adiabatic  approximation,  models  of  combining  electronic  states  can  be  described  by  the 

parameters of PES, namely by the location of its minimum (equilibrium geometry, s) and curvature 

(force constants, u). This system of parameters have proved suitable in the theory of vibrations and 

vibrational  spectra  of  polyatomic  molecules,  since  it  gives  clear  physical  picture  and  holds  some 

transferability  in  series  of  molecules  and  structural  groups.    In  turn,  vibrational  structure  of 

electronic spectra is related to changes in PES upon excitation (

s ∆∆ ,
u

) which for large molecules 

are  typically  small  (of  the  order  of  5%)  unless  transitions  between  isomers  are  considered. 

Correspondingly, required transferability of these quantities must be at least 2 orders of magnitude 
higher than that of parameters of the ground state (s(0), u(0)).  However, calculations show [54] that 

even  for  polyenes,  that  have  rather  similar  geometrical  and  electronic  structures,  straightforward 

transfer of  s∆  and  u∆  from one molecule to another results in serious errors. Besides, these values 

differ from one electronic states to another. It obviously raises severe difficulties on the way toward 

developing  databases  of  molecular  fragments  for  spectral  calculations.  Therefore,  a  theory  of 

vibronic  spectra  should  be  based  on  an  alternative  system  of  “hidden”  parameters  of  adiabatic 

molecular model that necessarily meet the following criteria: 

(i) 

(ii) 

clear physical meaning and correlation with PES parameters; 

locality that could allow to separate out characteristic structural groups (fragments); 

(iii) 

transferability between similar species containing typical fragments; 

(iv) 

suitability for ranking and choosing relatively small set of most relevant parameters; 

(v) 

independence  from  small  changes  of  electron  density  distribution  in  fragment  upon 

excitation  that  allow  to  construct  unified  system  of  parameters  for  different  excited 

states;

In  developing  the  parametric  semiempirical  approach  we  will  proceed  from  the  methods  proposed 

for  calculation  of  parameters  of  excited  state  PES  [55]  and  parameterization  of  molecular  models 

[47, 56, 57]. 

In  harmonic  approximation,  PES  of  the  n-th  electronic  state  expressed  in  terms  of 

independent normal coordinates Q(0) of the ground state represents as:

where the matrix of squares of vibrational frequencies  Λ , as well as Q(0), for the ground state can be

[13]  According  to  the  Hellmann-Feynman  theorem,  generalized  forces  a(n)  (taken  with  opposite

Assuming  that  deformations  of  molecular  model  associated  with  electronic  excitation  are  small 

(compared  to  equilibrium  configuration)  and  retaining  only  the  first  order  terms  in  (1.7),  we  then 

replace A(n)  by A(0) getting rid of the term proportional to

(1.13) 

These  approximations  are  also  supported  by  the  fact  that  the  relation  between  changes  in 

density matrix, geometry and force field parameters have linear form, which is well consistent with 

correlations between bond lengths, force constants and bond orders (see, for example, [14, 16, 21]).

 taken  at  equilibrium  configuration  define 

the  parameters  of  adiabatic  molecular  model  and  serve  as  “hidden”  parameters  of  the  theory. 

Analysis  of  their  properties  at  the  qualitative  level  [58]  had  shown  that  this  parameterization 

provides  good  starting  point  for  the  semiempirical  theory  of  vibronic  spectra  based  on  the  use  of 

molecular  fragments.    Here  we  discuss  the  most  important  features  of  the  proposed  method  and 

The locality of parameters is determined by the local properties of Coulomb and resonance 

integrals  that  come  from  many  quantum  calculations.  Since  matrix  elements

(where 

rχ  represents HAO basis) decrease rapidly as the distance from atoms 

rα  and 

sα , on which 

HAO 

rχ  and 

sχ  are centered, increases, these parameters can be attributed to local groups of atoms. 

Moreover,  differentiation  with  respect  to  natural  coordinates  enhances  this  effect,  so  that  only 

interactions between HAO and atoms, which form corresponding natural coordinate, will contribute 

to  the  value  of  parameter.  In  fact,  this  important  property  allows  to  assign  parameter  to  a  certain 

small (3–4 atoms) molecular fragment. The set of quantities 

qH ∂

 can then be divided into groups 

depending on the type of HAO (σ or π) and natural coordinate (bond length, valence angle, etc.). 

For example,

, where t refers to the type of HAO, c denotes the type of natural coordinate, 

r and s are the indices of HAO, i is the number of natural coordinate (see Fig.1.1).

Note  also  that  more  accurate  ranking  by  ab  initio  calculations  does  not  usually  make  much  sense, 

cause optimal values can be obtained only through semiempirical calibration with real experimental 

spectroscopic data.  

It  is  possible,  therefore,  to  work  out  parametric  models  of  different  levels  of  accuracy 

considering only the terms up to a certain order that significantly reduces the number of parameters 

responsible  for  vibronic  band  shape  and  brings  it  to  a  small  number.  This  not  only  simplifies 

calculations of (1.12) and (1.13), but also makes the model intuitive and assures that determination 

of parameters from experimental data represents a well-posed problem. 

Yet another important property of the proposed system of parameters is that it is unified for 

different  electronic  states.  All  the  parameters  are  defined  by  the  molecular  structure  and  can  be 

obtained  from  purely  geometric  considerations,  whereas  the  changes  occurring  due  to  electronic 

excitation are accounted by the increment in electron density matrix 

)(nP∆

 which can be calculated 

by one of quantum chemical methods. 

Further,  transferability  of

 in  homologous  series  follows  from  the 

same  property  of  Coulomb  and  resonance  integrals.  The  derivatives  are  not  small,  so  that  the 

requirements on their transferability are generally weaker than that for force field and geometrical 

parameters of PES.  These requirements are basically of the same order as for force constants in the 

theory of IR spectra, and, hence, transferability of the parameters is expected to be even better (it is 

found sufficient for quantitative predictions of vibronic spectra), cause these quantities, unlike force 

constants, do not depend upon the effect of far interactions, e.g., in conjugated systems. 

 

 

It is clear enough that matrix He should be computed in HAO, but not in AO, basis, since in 

this  case  structural  features  of  molecular  fragments  appear  explicitly.  It  also  makes  the  system  of 

parameters invariant and improves its transferability by eliminating the dependence on the choice of 

laboratory coordinate system.  

The  parameters  have  clear  physical  meaning  and  can  be  computed  by  ab  initio  or 

semiempirical  methods.  For  example,

there is no reason for semiempirical parameters to coincide with those calculated ab initio, mainly 

because of approximations involved from both sides.

It is essential that

excitation).  So, to a first approximation, these two quantities define the model of excited electronic 

states  of π-electron  molecular  systems,  which  correlates  well  with  direct  calculations  of  vibronic 

spectra of polyenes, acenes, diphenylpolyenes and related species with 

*ππ  transitions [21-24]. The 

results  of  these  simulations,  which  take  into  account  only  changes  in  bond  lengths  and  force 

constants,  are  in  good  agreement  with  experiment.  However,  it  is  expected  that  quantitative 

description  of 

*πn

 transitions  accompanied  by  substantial  deformation  of σ-electron  density  will 

require full consideration of changes in valence angles and corresponding parameters. 

For  a  parametric  method  and  computational  algorithms  to  be  applicable  in  practice  it  is 

required to satisfy some stability criteria with respect to variations of parameters. It can be shown 

 

9

that  stability  (in  the  sense  that  small  variations  of  model  do  not  lead  to  large  changes  in  spectral 

curve) is guaranteed by the stability with respect to “natural” PES parameters 

s ∆∆ ,
u

 and linearity 

of relations (1.12), (1.13). 

Thus, here we see that, due to the reasons discussed, straightforward conventional adiabatic 

molecular  models  built  in  terms  of  bond  lengths,  valence  angles,  force  constants  proved 

inappropriate  for  calculations  of  vibronic  spectra.  In  turn,  the  new  system  of  “hidden”  parameters 

has been designed to meet the requirements that appear in practical modeling and direct simulations. 

This  system  itself  holds  much  promise  as  a  basis  for  parametric  semiempirical  adiabatic  theory  of 

vibronic spectra and efficient methods for computing vibronic transition probabilities. Certainly, the 

approach  should  be  tested  through  extensive  comparative  studies  over  a  number  of  molecules  and 

homologous series. The next section outlines our results in this direction. We examine properties and 

efficiency  of  the  proposed  parametric  method  and  its  predictive  ability  making  comparisons  of 

calculated vibronic spectra with experimental data. 

2. Calculations of stationary vibronic spectra with the parametric method 

Of  the  homologous  series  that  demonstrate  well  resolved  vibrational  structure  of  electronic 

spectra,  extensively  studied,  therefore,  both  theoretically  and  experimentally,  are  polyenes,  their 

substituted  derivatives  (in  particular,  diphenylpolyenes),  acenes  and  azines.  The  results  collected 

here  show  the  parametric  method  as  it  was  employed  for  calculations  of  vibronic  spectra, 

specifically for polyenes and acenes.    

2a. Polyenes 

Molecular  models  of  polyenes  in  their  ground  states  were  constructed  from  fragments  of 

smaller  homologous  with  force  field  parameters  transferred  “as  is”.  It  was  confirmed  by  the 

simulations that, in an analogy with polymers, as the length of polyene chain increases, contributions 

from  terminal  groups  gradually  become  negligible,  whereas  parameters  of  the  inner 

> C

=

 

H

fragments approach a limit, which can be considered constant for all groups within a molecule and 

for longer homologues. For this reason, values of bond lengths and force constants for links between 

fragments were set to those of inner groups in sufficiently long molecules. Experimental data, other 

theoretical studies including quantum calculations of electron density and estimates for parameters 

obtained  through  correlations  “index—length—force  constant  of  the  bond”  [21]  have  justified  this 

procedure.  Calculations  of  vibrational  frequencies  of  the  ground  state  have  shown  that  this  simple 

 

 

 

10

approximation provides good agreement with experiment, so that there is no need for solving inverse 

problems.  This  supports,  again,  the  fact  that  the  idea  of  molecular  fragments  together  with 

understanding  the  peculiar  properties  of  various  homologous  series  give  efficient  models  of  the 

ground states with accurately computed IR frequencies. 

By  virtue  of  approximations,  any  parametric  method  is  a  semiempirical  one  that  implies 

“adjustment”  of  the  system  of  parameters  to  match  direct  or  indirect  experimental  data.  Such 

corrections  have  been  introduced  to  rough  values  of

method in order to account for real errors associated with approximations, inaccuracies of quantum 

calculations and adiabatic model itself. In the first approximation of the theory (with a minimal set

=0.1 a.u.  Making  the  use  of  a  single 

parameter, which was set equal for all groups and all homologous (NCC=3–13, [48, 52, 53]), allows, 

however,  to  achieve  satisfactory  quantitative  description  of  changes  in  electronic  states  upon 

excitation. For bond lengths the deviations are ~15%, in average, with a maximum of ~35% for C–C 

bond in hexatriene (variations of the same order was observed in the solutions of inverse problems 

[25]). The same holds for force constants. It is important that the parametric approach treats changes 

of different natural coordinates, including angles, in a unified way. These changes for valence angles 

come  out  much  smaller  than  those  for  bond  lengths  (about  20%,  in  relative  units),  which  is 

consistent  with  typical  results  of  inverse  problem  solution  (15%  [25]).  Moreover,  for  the  majority 

(~70%) of angular coordinates, the method in most cases reproduces these results quantitatively.  

Primary  criteria  for  correctness  of  parametric  approach,  chosen  system  of  parameters  and 

specific  values  of  parameters,  adequacy  of  excited  state  model,  should  necessarily  be  based  on 

agreement  of  calculated  spectra  with  experiment.  This  is  because  there  are  no  direct  experimental 

methods  that  would  measure  PES  parameters  and  the  only  indirect  way  to  get  this  information  is 

spectroscopic  interpretation.  The  other  part  of  the  reason  is  that  computational  uncertainties  of 

quantum chemical methods turn out to be of the order of changes in these quantities upon electronic 

excitation and so there is just no point to compare such results obtained, for example, by different 

methods.

Calculated  absorption  spectra  of  polyenes  (butadiene,  hexatriene,  hexadecaheptaene, 

tetradecaheptaene,  octateraene,  and  decatetraene)  shown  in  Fig.2.1-2.6  demonstrate  remarkable 

quantitative agreement in band positions and intensities with experimental spectra. Note that the first 

approximation  model  was  calibrated  for  butadiene  and  hexatriene  and  then  used  unchanged. 

Therefore, calculations of spectra of longer polyenes in this approximation are purely predictive.  

There  are  some  peculiarities,  though,  to  explain  which  we  should  go  beyond  the  first 

approximation.  For  low-frequency  bands  calculations  give  intensities  systematically  lower  than 
observed. For example, for octatetraene experimental relative intensity at ~200 cm-1 is about 0.11, 
whereas  computed  value  is  as  low  as  0.02;  for  hexatriene  at  ~300  cm-1  these  are  0.18  and  0.03, 
respectively.  On  the  contrary,  С-С  bond  stretching  vibronic  modes  (~1200  cm-1)  in  calculated 

spectra of octatetraene and butadiene are perceptibly stronger than in experimental (0.41 and 0.23 for 

octatertaene). This leads to significant errors in intensities of overtones and combination bands (for 
example, the first overtone of 1235 cm-1 vibration in octatetraene spectrum is about fourfold more 

intense than its experimental value). It was found reasonable to assume that these discrepancies are 

attributed  to  inaccurate  geometries  of  excited  state  models,  namely  to  changes  in  angular 

coordinates, since their contributions even to valence modes may be noticeable, ~10%. Similar result 

follows also from the analysis performed in [48], where it was shown that consecutive refinement of 

first  approximation  model  (by  first  taking  into  account  changes  in  bond  lengths  only  and,  then,  in 

angles) improves agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra. 

Of  the  short  polyenes  (butadiene,  hexartiene,  octatetraene),  spectrum  with  best  resolved 

vibrational structure was obtained experimentally for octatetraene [63]. Besides, it can be expected 

that with increasing length of polyene chain, the number of relevant angular parameters will grow 

and  that  overall  spectral  effect  for  octatetraene  will  be  stronger,  than  it  is  for  shorter  homologues. 

For these reasons, we calibrated parameters of the second approximation using octatetraene model as 

a  testing  bed,  with  general  strategy  being  to  apply  unchanged  set  of  parameters  to  other  polyenes. 

This allowed us to test the quality of parameterization, transferability of parameters and predictive 

ability of the method itself.

undergoes  only  small  change  (<20%),  while  the  angular  parameters  are  by  an  order  of  magnitude

different levels of accuracy [48]. 

 

15

Calculated spectral curve, frequencies, intensities and line assignment in vibronic absorption 

spectrum are given on Fig.2.5 (curve 2). Theoretical spectrum is in good agreement with intensities 

of all major peaks observed in the experiment. In the second approximation, the intensities of 

1
010  

and 

1
07  bands come out smaller approaching experimental values. Further, equal attention should be 

paid to weak lines; as compared to the first approximation, the sum of relative discrepancies between 

experimental  and  calculated  intensities  reduces  from  0.7  down  to  0.4,  their  mean  value  decreases 

from  0.05  to  0.03,  standard  deviation  —  from  0.05  to  0.02.  Thereby,  the  second  approximation 

evidently  gives  better  results  and  describes  more  accurately  the  structure  of  excited  states  and, 

especially, its features related to angular deformations. 

We then applied the second approximation model, without making any corrections, to other 

homologous  —  butadiene  (Fig.2.1),  hexatriene  (Fig.2.2)  and  decatetraene  (Fig.2.6).  For  all  the 

molecules, it improves agreement with experiment as, for example, in low-frequency (~300 ÷ 400 
cm-1) range of hexatriene spectrum, as well as around major vibronic lines (~1200 cm-1 and ~1600 

cm-1) and for combination bands (compare experimental (4), first (1) and second (2) approximation 

curves on Fig.2.2). The effect is also noticeable in poorly resolved absorption spectrum of butadiene 

(Fig.2.1). 

Highly structured spectrum of decatetraene [64] (Fig.2.6) is shaped mainly by characteristic 

peaks  1

01 , 

1
02 , 

1
07  and 

1

010  corresponding  to  excited  state  vibrations  with  frequencies 

eν =132,  405, 

1230  and  1651 cm-1  (for  mode  numbers  refer  to  [52]).  Calculated  values  of  these  frequencies  are 
cν =146,  403,  1239  and  1641 cm-1,  respectively,  that  shows  good  quantitative  match  with 

experimental  picture.  Weak  bands 

1
05 , 

1
06  and 

1
08  overlap  with  stronger  line 

1
07  giving  rise  to 

complex  structure  in  this  region,  well  reproduced  in  simulations.  While  modes  1  and  2  represent 

deformation vibrations, modes 7 and 10 contain a mix of CC bond stretchings and CCC and CCH 

angular vibrations. So, it comes as no surprise that in the first approximation with complete neglect 

of angular parameters, computed intensities differ markedly from experimental ones (Ie( 1

07 )=0.2 and 

Ic( 1

07 )=0.32, Ie(

1

010 )=0.52 and Ic(

1

010 )=0.63, Ie( 1

01 )=0.2 and Ic( 1

01 )=0.05, 

1
02  vibration is not present 

in  the  spectrum  at  all).    Note  how  going  to  the  second  approximation  improves  these  things: 

Ic( 1

07 )=0.14, Ic(

1

010 )=0.54, Ic( 1

01 )=0.18, also progression  2

01  and low-frequency band 

1
02  appear; the 

sum of relative differences between theoretical and experimental intensities reduces fourfold (from 

0.38 to 0.1). Characteristic shape of 

1

07  band approaches experimental one and can now be explained 

by  the  presence  of  weak,  unresolved  in  experiment,  adjacent  lines  Ic(1260 cm-1)≅0.01  and 

Ic(1289 cm-1)≅0.03  that  correspond  to  totally  symmetric  vibrations.  Similarly,  the  origin  of 

1
010  

 

16

asymmetry  can  be  traced  to  existence  of 

1

09  satellite  with  Ic(1662 cm-1)≅0.1.  In  our  analysis,  as 

distinct from [64], 273 cm-1 band is assigned to the second harmonics  2

01 .  

Yet  another  evidence  for  the  parametric  method  to  be  efficient  at  describing  fine  spectral 

effects  in  large  molecules  (some  tens  of  atoms)  comes  from  consideration  of  methyl-substituted 

polyenes.  Indeed,  detected  spectral  shifts  associated  with  methyl-substitution  match  experimental 

results  within  accuracy  less  than  3%  and  correctly  reproduced  shift  directions.  For  example  see 

octatetraene (OT), Fig.2.5, and decatetraene (DT), Fig.2.6: the strongest

appears as either low-energy (OT) or high-energy (DT) shoulder near 

1

observed line shape in this region. The next strong composite profile around 

1
07  changes mainly in 

intensity (

), due to the growth of weaker overlapping 

1
06  band. Low-frequency 

1
01  component exhibits the maximal change in intensity (2 times), as well as in line position, upon 

methyl-substitution. 

Simulations have shown that as the length of polyene chain increases, general spectral pattern 

stays the same, but some redistribution of intensity between major bands occurs, so that intensities of 

valence  modes  (~1650  and  ~1250 cm-1)  scale  approximately  as

), where 

CCN  is  the  number  of  C–C  bonds.  This  is  an  indication  of  the  importance  of  angular  parameters 

(second approximation) for simulations of longer polyenes. 

Here we see that parametric method, even with minimal number of parameters (only 2 in the 

first approximation), allows to develop quantitative transferable models of polyenes in excited states, 

perform spectroscopically accurate predictive calculations and detailed interpretation of spectra. An 

advantage  of  the  parametric  method  at  capturing  major  features  of  excited  states  is  illustrated  on 

Fig.2.2,  where  curve  3  shows  the  same  hexatriene  spectrum  simulated  by  alternative  quantum 

chemical method [63, 65, 66]. Similar results confirmed this for other molecules too [49, 50].

2b. Acenes 

Comparison  of  calculated  in  the  first  approximation  [49]  spectrum  of  anthracene  (Fig.2.7a) 

with the results of experiments (Fig.2.7c,d) [67, 68] finds good overall agreement up to weak totally 

symmetric  modes.  However,  we  note  significant  differences,  for  example,  in  intensities  of 

0

(ve=391 cm-1), 

0

18  (ve=1163 cm-1) and

 (ve=1797 cm-1). The sum of discrepancies reaches 0.48 

in relative units. For tetracene, essentially the same picture is observed (Fig.2.8a,c). 

It seemed a priori reasonable that for polycyclic compounds, in which changes of C–C bonds 

are  often  accompanied  by  angular  deformations,  the  second  approximation  with  its  angular 

parameters  (first  derivatives  with  respect  to  CCC  and  CCH  angles)  will  be  expected  to  improve 

 

20

 

 

accuracy.  The  system  of  parameters  was  optimized  for  anthracene  (see  the  best  fit  obtained, 

Fig.2.7a,b)  and  basically  takes  the  form  of  small  (~10%)  corrections  to  the  first  approximation

0

13  at  ve=1643  cm-1)  that  was 

previously interpreted as related to either nontotally symmetric b1g vibrations [67] or different matrix 

site [68]. This is consistent with Franck-Condon approximation and confirms correct assignment of 

these bands. Detailed comparison has shown that going to the second approximation reduces overall 

sum of relative differences between calculations and experiment from 0.48 до 0.13, mainly due to 

better  agreement  in

second  harmonics  of  the  7th  and  8th  vibrations  appear  symmetrically  about 

spectrum (Fig.2.7b), but in the experimental spectrum they are masked by stronger 

0
14  in  the  calculated 

0
14  and 

0
13  bands. 

Following  the  same  strategy,  we  tested  efficiency  and  predictive  ability  of  the  system  of 

parameters  by  transferring  it  to  anthracene-d10  and  tetracene  (Fig.2.8-2.10)  with  no  modifications 

introduced.  

Computed shifts in vibrational frequencies of anthracene upon deuteration are typically less 

than  3%,  which  is  fairly  close  to  the  observed  effect.  Among  active  vibronic  modes  in  the  range 
1000–1300 cm-1,  the  largest  shifts  (100–320 cm-1)  are  detected  for  those  with  significant 

contributions from CCH angular vibrations. The intensities are also affected by a factor ranging from

basic model of anthracene excited states in the second approximation.

in the region 1000–1200 cm-1. Half-width of ~1200 cm-1 band is larger in the experimental spectrum 

than the others, that suggests existence of two adjacent lines with comparable intensities revealed by 

simulations.  Note  especially  that  good  agreement  with  the  experiment  for  tetracene  was  obtained 

with the system of parameters taken “as is”, i.e. without solving an inverse problem. 

Efficiency  of  the  method  and  the  system  of  parameters  find  another  justification  in 

quantitative  predictions  of  spectra  measured  under  different  experimental  conditions.  Here  we 

consider  spectra  of  dispersed  fluorescence  of  anthracene  [67]  and  compare  them  with  the  spectra 

simulated with selective excitation to various single vibronic levels (Fig.2.11). The model provides 

essentially  the  same  level  of  accuracy  as  reported  above  for  predictions  of  conventional  spectra, 

while dispersed fluorescence, being rather sensitive to variations of excitation conditions, involves 

quite different sets of vibronic transitions in each case. 

Thus, the parametric method has proved to be an accurate and efficient technique to tackle 

direct  problem  of  computing  vibronic  spectra.  It  allows  to  perform  quantitative  predictions  of 

structure  and  properties  of  molecular  excited  states  and  radiative  vibronic  transition  probabilities, 

including  fine  spectral  effects  associated  with  various  substitutions  (methyl-,  phenyl-,  deutero-). 

These results are found in good agreement with a number of independent spectral experiments and, 

thereby,  confirm  possibility  of  predictive  calculations  based  on  the  use  of  small  (3-4  atoms) 

characteristic  molecular  fragments.  Such  building  blocks  (or  mini-models)  can  be  calibrated  on 

different  levels  of  approximation  depending  on  the  complexity  of  system  under  consideration,  but 

the  number  of  relevant,  physically  reasonable  parameters  is  expected  to  remain  small.  This  latter 

factor is believed to be a key to development of specialized databases of molecular fragments that 

store information accumulated through solution of inverse spectral problems. 

 

3. Modeling time-resolved vibronic spectra 

It appears quite natural to develop the parametric approach towards modeling time-dependent 

spectra, which apparently bring more information as compared to conventional vibronic spectra. At 

first  sight,  it  may  seem,  though,  that  all  one  need  to  compute  dynamical  spectrum  are  the 

probabilities of vibronic transitions 

ijw  that can be estimated by the parametric method described in 

previous sections. However, in practice, a number of questions and problems arise.  

First, to what extent the parameters of molecular model obtained (calibrated) with the use of 

conventional (stationary) spectra will be good for modeling time-resolved spectra? 

Second, the effect of environment (molecular interactions) may substantially alter the picture 

seen  in  spectral  experiment  with  time  resolution  with  the  problem  being  to  distinguish  between 

 

22

contributions from non-radiative and optical transitions. 

Third,  absorption,  as  well  as  radiative  and  non-radiative  relaxation  processes  can  induce 

isomerization,  which  is  an  issue  of  particular  interest  in  photochemistry.  In  part,  this  problem  is 

traced back to calculating probabilities of optical and non-radiative inter-isomer transitions. 

Fourth, in regard to purely computational aspects, besides the fact that an extensive number 

of  transition  probabilities 

ijw  have  to  be  calculated,  even  in  case  of  mid-size  molecules  (≈ 20–30 

atoms)  a  high  dimensional  (N

310>

)  system  of  differential  equations  is  to  be  solved  for  time-

dependent  populations

.  Although  general  methods  are  well-known,  their  applicability  and 

performance in large-scale computer simulations are questionable, especially for iterative solution of 

inverse problems.   

isomer form. 

Studies in these directions are underway (for recent results see: nonradiative transitions [70], 

optical  inter-isomer  transition  probabilities  [16,  71],  generalized  inverse  problems  in  vibronic 

spectroscopy [72]). Here we shall focus primarily on the first part of the problem – direct calculation 

of  time-resolved  vibronic  spectra  for  a  model  of  isolated  molecule  and  transitions  within  single 

A dynamical time-resolved fluorescence spectrum can be represented as a three dimensional 

(3D) surface showing dependence of intensity on both frequency and time:

)(tni

 is the time-dependent population of the i-th state. 

 

Hence,  to  construct  such  surface  for  a  given  molecular  model  it  is  necessary  to  (i) find 

transition  probabilities 

ijw  for  all  pairs  of  N  molecular  energy  levels  and  (ii)  solve  the  system  of 

kinetic  (rate)  equations  for  populations 

.  Methods  and  software  for  calculation  of  vibrational 

)(tni

and  vibronic  radiative  transition  probabilities  are  well  developed  [13,  16,  19,  20,  73-75]  while  the 

second  task  suggests  that  an  efficient  procedure  for  solution  of  high  dimensional  system  of 

differential equations should be employed since preliminary estimates revealed low performance of 

standard techniques in real-time computer experiments and for realistic molecular models.

As analysis of applicable computational techniques has shown [76], for simulation of spectra

Indeed,  the  speed  of  calculations  according  to  this  procedure  scales  as 

2N  and  there  is  no 

need to store any additional matrices except P. Besides, the algorithm can be optimized to gain in 

speed by a factor of about 100 by using explicitly the triangular form of matrix P and eliminating 

equations  with  trivial  solutions  once  initial  conditions  are  specified.  But  it  is  more  important  that 

numerical  solution  can  be  easily  obtained  for  any  matrix  of  probabilities  (including  one  with 

degenerate eigenvalues that may appear in applications quite often). Moreover, the method becomes 

equally applicable to systems with time-dependent probabilities, as is the case when quantum beats 

associated with isomerization are to be taken into account. 

Some conclusions immediately follow from the analysis of kinetic equations [76].  

The  time  dependence  of  population  of  the  i-th  energy  level  and,  hence,  intensities  of 

transitions originated from this level, will show multi-exponential behavior determined by the total 

probability 

iw  and those of higher levels 

kw  (k>i). Note that the system of molecular energy levels 

can be split into groups of vibrational sublevels that belong to different electronic states. Consider 

the  ground  state  (0)  and  the  first  excited  state  (1)  and  their  vibrational  sublevels  denoted  by  the 

symbols  f  and  i  (these  indices  refer  to  sets  of  quantum  numbers).  Then  the  total  probabilities  of 

optical vibronic transitions from sublevels of the excited state to sublevels of the ground state (here 

the probabilities of nonradiative vibrational transitions within excited state manifold are assumed to 

be zero) are given by:

where

10µ  are the frequency and electronic dipole transition moment. 

 

One  can  see  from  equation  (3.3)  that  total  probabilities  for  all  vibrational  sublevels  of  an 

excited electronic state of isolated molecule are the same as determined by values of 

10µ  and 

10ω  for 

electronic  transition.  It  was  also  verified  experimentally  (see  [78])  with  the  use  of  time-dependent 

intensities of dispersed fluorescence spectra. So, to a first approximation (probabilities of vibrational 

transitions  are  negligibly  small),  all  lines  within  a  single  electronic  spectra,  say, 

S → ,  will 
S
1
0

exhibit  uniform  multi-exponential  dynamics,  but  their  intensities  will  still  depend  on  individual 

probabilities  of  vibronic  transitions 

jw

,1 → .  The  implication  here  is  that  any  differences  in  time 

,0

k

profiles can serve as signatures of vibrational relaxation. 

 

If  high  vibrational  levels  (overtones  and  combination  bands)  are  selectively  excited, 

relaxation may include transitions with almost equal probabilities (particularly those that would have 

the  highest  intensity  with  the  change  in  vibrational  quantum  number  of  1).  In  this  situation  the 

system  of  kinetic  equations  does  not  split  into  separate  blocks  but  has  degenerate  (or  close  to 

degenerate) eigenvalues and general solution is sought. Partly for this reason, we have built all our 

algorithms  and  software  making  use  of  numerical  integrator  rather  than  attempting  to  derive  an 

analytical  solution  in  every  single  case  beyond  the  simplest,  easily  diagonalizable  system.  As  an 

additional reward, this strategy provides maximum flexibility for further extensions of the model.  

Shown on Fig.3.1-3.3 are some examples of simulated time-resolved spectra for butadiene, 

hexatriene  and  octatetraene  when  various  vibronic  states  (purely  electronic,  totally  symmetric  and 

non-totally symmetric vibrations) are initially excited.  Spectral patterns that correspond to different 

symmetries  of  vibrational  wave  function  appear  qualitatively  distinct.  Even  small  deviation  in 

excitation frequency (

ν
≈∆

10

cm

) is detectable (see Fig.3.4) by comparing relative intensities of 

−

1

strong lines (

0≤ν ) and by the absence of signal for frequencies above the electronic origin (

0>ν ). 

This,  in  particular,  gives  an  estimate  for  the  selectivity  of  excitation  required  to  produce  a  good 

experimental  spectra  that  can  be  compared  with  simulations  or  used  for  solution  of  an  inverse 

problem.  It  is  also  notable  that  excitation  of  totally  symmetric  vibrations  gives  rise  to  more 

informative spectra and simulations can help in the search for conditions which would be optimal for 

28

a  specific  experiment  pursuing  quantitative  or  qualitative  analysis  (for  example,  frequency  of  the 

most active mode can be estimated). 

 What  might  also  turn  out  to  be  nontrivial  is  the  issue  of  finding  appropriate  spectral  and 

temporal ranges for experimental measurements if the set of high-energy molecular levels is excited 

by  a  broadband  pulse.  Under  such  conditions  decay  evolves  through  a  number  of  intermediate 

vibronic states so that fluorescence spectrum is expected to be quite complicated. For example, as 

shown  on  Fig.3.5,  the  full  time-resolved  spectrum  of  diphenylbutadiene  excited  into 

5S  electronic 

state consists of strong band due to transition 

S →  and substantially (approximately by a factor

4S  states  and  transition  probabilities  can  be  retrieved  (through  solution  of 

inverse  spectral  problem  [79,  80])  from  weak  and  slowly  changing  spectra  of  transitions

structure and dynamics of intermediate states.  

For solution of an inverse problem it is important to have as detailed experimental spectrum 

as  possible  which  presumably  should  depend  on  most  parameters  (transition  probabilities)  to  be 

determined  at  once.  Computer  experiments  confirm  strong  dependence  of  dynamical  spectrum  on 

excitation  conditions  and  what  immediately  follows  from  this  is  the  possibility  of  controlling  3D 

spectral signal for a given molecule. For example, if

(Fig.3.6a) apparently gives only probabilities of transitions originating from the vibrational sublevels 

of

5S  are  initially  populated),  this  same  spectrum  now  depends  on  all  nonzero  probabilities  of 

transitions  between  states  below

).  Here  the  role  of  the 

second  pulse  is  to  strengthen  this  weak  band  making  it  possible  to  extract  its  probability  from 

experimental spectrum. 

It  is  also  essential  that  direct  simulations  of  dynamical  spectra  together  with  experimental 

data and methods for solution of inverse problems can eventually provide insights into probabilities 

of  nonradiative  vibrational  processes  in  excited  electronic  states.  As  mentioned  above,  vibrational 

relaxation manifests as differences in time dependences of individual vibronic lines. A quantitative 

approach to this problem and technique that would allow for possibility of obtaining the values of 

probabilities  from  spectral  data  suggests  certain  experimental  setting  that  makes  the  effects 

associated with nonradiative dissipation reliably detectable. Consider the case when probabilities of 

vibrational transitions 

vibrw  are comparable with those of electronic transitions 

elw . Due to sensitive 

dependence of time-resolved spectrum on variation of excitation conditions, with increasing energy 

of excitation pulse spectrum evolves from almost identical to that calculated with 

0=vibrw

 (compare 

Fig.3.7a  and  Fig.3.7b)  toward  complex  nonuniform  (Fig.3.7d)  and  multiexponential  (Fig.3.7f) 

structures.  Such  experimental  spectra  obtained  with  broadband  excitation  to  high-energy  sublevels 

carry  more  information  about  relaxation  processes  and  can  be  more  effectively  used.  Indeed,  the 

possibility  to  extract  the  values  of  nonradiative  transition  probabilities  from  3D  spectrum  comes 

from the fact that intensities depend on different total probabilities

vibr

ijw  (along  with  variable 

parameters  themselves)  as  the  calculated  spectrum  approaches  experimental  one  in  the  course  of 

iterations.  The  amount  of  information  contained  in  the  experimental  spectrum,  thus,  clearly 

correlates with the number of spectral lines that exhibit various behaviors.

Thereby,  simulations  of  dynamical  vibronic  spectra  being  a  window  into  developing 

quantitative  models  of  nonradiative  processes,  can  help  extend  methods  of  quantitative  and 

qualitative standardless analysis based on time-resolved spectroscopy [81, 82] to the case of dense 

media (solid gases, liquids) where the effect of collisional nonradiative intermolecular relaxation is 

important,  since  molecular  interactions  irreversibly  transfer  some  part  of  excitation  energy  into 

external  (translational)  degrees  of  freedom  that  results  in  increase  of  ensemble  temperature.

the fraction of excitation energy transferred to thermal modes due to collisions is left unknown. This 

uncertainty can be resolved either by using spectra with absolute intensities, although it is difficult in 

practice,  or  via  an  additional  measurement  of  change  in  temperature  or  other  thermodynamical 

parameters of sample (for a review on photothermal spectroscopy see [83]).  We shall also discuss 

nonradiative transitions in the next section. 

 

Quite  often,  features  of  conventional  spectra  (without  time-resolution)  of  a  number  of 

molecules (for example, polyenes, phenyl- and diphenylpolyenes), their stereoisomers or substituted 

forms (cis, trans-isomers, deutero-, methyl-, phenyl-substituted) are almost identical [16, 48-51, 63-

66, 84-86]. In this situation differences in intensities of major vibronic lines (~10%) may fall, in fact, 

within the error bar of calculations that makes interpretation of such spectra, much less identification 

of  compounds  (especially  in  a  mixture),  nearly  impossible.  This  obstacle  significantly  restricts  the 

use  of  some  spectral  methods  in  analytical  chemistry  and  photochemistry  (in  particular,  if 

photoisomerization is involved [33]).

The  approaches  from  time-resolved  spectroscopy  provide  a  technique  to  tackle  these 

problems  in  a  more  efficient  way.  Shown  on  Fig.3.8  is  3D  spectrum  of  mixture  of  cis-  and  trans-

octatetraene and its sections at different times. It is clearly seen that evolution of spectrum suggests 

that  contributions  from  different  components  of  mixture  can  be  distinguished  (assigned)  based  on 

their unique time-dependences (those strong bands that correspond to trans-isomer are marked with 

asterisks). It was verified in [81] that such characteristic differences in time profiles allow to perform 

both qualitative and quantitative analyses in a wide range of relative concentrations (in this case — 

from 

C

 up to 

cis CC

).  

Note also that while energies of purely electronic transitions of isomers differ only slightly, 
by  one  or  two  vibrational  quanta  (~2000  cm-1  for  cis-  and  trans-octatetraene),  simultaneous 

excitation  of  mixture  components  by  even  spectrally  narrow  pulse  produces  quantitatively  distinct 

distributions of initially populated vibronic states at each of the isomers. For instance, the spectrum 

on Fig.3.8 represents dynamics occurring when purely electronic state of trans-octatetraene and 10 

sublevels (totally symmetric vibrational modes with energies 

0

2000

cm

) of cis-octatetraene 

1
−

are initially excited. This gives the presence of signal in the range above the electronic origin for cis-

octatetraene as another signature of this component in the mixture. 

The use of dynamical spectra can be equally efficient also in the case when the problem is to 

identify molecules with different locations of substituents and it is difficult to do that using spectra 

without time resolution. For cis- and trans-diphenylbutadiene computed differences are typically less 

than  10%  for  frequencies,  intensities  in  vibronic  spectrum  and  energies  of  electronic  transitions 

( 33400 and 

33000

1

−сm ). This can be traced to almost identical structure of polyene chains in such 

compounds. In addition, as calculations have shown, changes in electron density upon transition to 

the first excited state are well localized mainly within the chains rather than phenyl rings. For this 

reason, bond lengths and force constants in “polyene fragments” show 2-3 times greater changes (as 

compared  to  phenyl  rings)  specifically  responsible  for  the  structure  of  vibronic  spectrum  and  its 

independence on locations of substituent groups. At the same time, these species can be identified by 

characteristic decay profiles in time-resolved spectrum (see sections on Fig.3.9), even though bands 

overlap  each  other.  It  was  also  confirmed  by  computer  experiments  that  efficiency  of  such 

recognition procedure increases as molecules are excited to higher electronic states.   

The  researches  summarized  herein  have  been  aimed  to  show  some  new  potentials  and 

efficiency of approaches from time-resolved spectroscopy as estimated by means of simulations. In 

this  still  developing  field  computer  experiments  and  molecular  modeling  [76,  81,  87]  can  be  very 

 

36

useful, able to guide experiments with an appropriate choice of optimal conditions and settings that 

would otherwise be hard or extremely resource-consuming to find in a purely empirical manner.  

 

4. Simulations of dynamical spectra and inter-isomer transitions 

So  far,  the  model  of  isolated  molecule  and  transitions  in  the  single  isomer  form  were 

assumed.  To  further  extend  applications  of  computational  methods  described  in  previous  sections, 

we address the problem of computing dynamical spectra when transitions between different isomers 

are  taken  into  account.  Together  with  methods  developed  for  calculation  of  photoinduced  inter-

isomer transition probabilities [18-20, 48-50, 73, 74, 82], direct simulations of dynamics provide an 

approach to mechanisms and rates of isomerization in polyatomic molecules.   

We will make use of the theoretical model of isomerization proposed earlier [88]. External 

perturbation  imposed  on  resonance  levels  of  isomers  (

EE

)  with  nonzero  coupling 

(nondiagonal  element  of  energy  matrix)  gives  rise  to  quantum  beats,  i.e.  periodic  oscillations  in 

concentrations  of 

isomers.  This  superposition  state 

is  described  by

previous  section  are  equally  applicable  to  solution  of  time-dependent  kinetic  equations  and 

computing  dynamical  spectra  of  coupled  isomers.  Here  we  outline  some  examples  of  numerical 

experiments.   

Resonant  mixing  of  stationary  levels  of  isomers  (Fig.4.1)  and  quantum  beats  manifest  as 

oscillatory behavior of intensities in time-resolved spectra (Fig.4.2). For this set of simulations the 

initial  conditions  were  set  so  that  only  levels  of  isomer  1  are  populated  at

demonstrate distinct oscillations. Note also how quantum beats, originated from resonance level 2,

which is about 20% in this particular case. 

As  a  second  example  consider  model  calculations  of  isomer  transformation  from 

pentadiene-1,3 to pentadiene-1,4 under various initial conditions. These simulations were aimed to 

investigate  the  interplay  between  quantum  beats  and  exponential  decay  of  fluorescence  intensities 

for  realistic  molecular  models.  We  have  determined  that  possible  resonance  may  exist  between 
1661 cm-1 (pentadiene-1,3) and 1293 cm–1 (pentadiene-1,4) sublevels of the first excited states, since 

these vibrational modes most closely match specific structural transformations of these molecules in 

the  course  of  isomerization.  The  plots  presented  here  show  dynamical  spectra  upon  broadband 
excitation (Fig.4.3-4.5) and selective excitation to 1661 cm-1 sublevel (Fig.4.6) of pentadiene-1,3 for 

w>>ω

, 

w≈ω  and 

w<<ω

,  where  w  stands  for  typical  probability  of  single  isomer  radiative 

 

38

transition (all intensities were normalized by their maximum values).  

These  results  indicate  that  while  at 

w>>ω

 (Fig.4.3)  and 

w≈ω  (Fig.4.4)  spectra  of  two 

isomers  have  nearly  equal  intensities,  in  the  opposite  case  (slow  quantum  beats, 

w<<ω

,  Fig.4.5) 

signal from isomer 2 comes out 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of isomer 1. This means that 

such weak spectrum will be almost completely masked by overlapping strong bands of isomer 1. It 

was estimated that spectrum of isomer 2 can be reliably detected (with intensity at least 10% relative 

to isomer 1) if 

w7.0>ω

. Low intensity of fluorescence from isomer 2 signifies low relative number 

(concentration)  of  molecules  that  underwent  isomerization  (this  quantity  approaches  zero  when 

w<<ω

, but it is still 1.5% at 

w>>ω

 and 2.0% at 

w≈ω ). Consequently, slow quantum beats have 

no  effect  on  dynamics  of  spectrum  of  isomer  1  (Fig.4.5a),  as  compared  to  the  case  of  isolated 

molecules.  Note,  however,  that  fluorescence  signal  from  isomer 2  can  still  be  observed  if  it  falls 

within  slightly  different  spectral  range  and  does  not  overlap  with  dominant  spectrum  of  the  first 

isomer. 

Spectro-temporal patterns observed when 

w>>ω

 (Fig.4.3) and 

w≈ω  (Fig.4.4) are similar 

and differ only quantitatively, mainly in frequency of quantum beats which appears explicitly in all 

time  dependences.  Spectrum  of  isomer  2  is  fully  modulated  (its  intensities  approach  zero  at  some 

points), while spectrum of the first isomer looks evidently more complex. This is due to not all the 

spectral  lines  exhibit  oscillations;  there  are  some  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  resonance  but 

contribute  to  superposition.  It  becomes  clear  when  resonance  level  is  exclusively  selected  by 

excitation (Fig.4.6) and all non-oscillatory contributions vanish. Dynamics of populations of the first 

isomer, its spectral response and quantum yield of isomerization are rather sensitive to variation of 

excitation  conditions.  But,  as  long  as  isomers  are  assumed  coupled  through  the  single  resonance 

level, normalized spectrum of the second isomer does not change upon these variations (see Fig.4.4b 

and Fig.4.6b).

5. Nonradiative transitions in gases under optical excitation 

 

Some of the spectral effects can be attributed to transitions without emitting electromagnetic 

radiation  (nonradiative  or  radiationless  transitions).  Among  them  are:  shape  of  the  emission 

spectrum and fluorescence quantum yield are independent of the excitation wavelength (Vavilov’s 

law [89] for condensed phases or dense gases); fluorescence quantum yield is less than one; for the 

vast majority of organic molecules fluorescence originates from the lowest excited state of a given 

multiplicity (Kasha’s rule [90]). All these effects are related to ensembles of molecules. However, 

the  common  approaches  to  nonradiative  transitions  make  use  of  the  model  of  isolated  molecule 

interacting  with  “bath  modes”.  Such  models  do  not  explicitly  account  for  real  properties  of 

environment and individual molecules, nor do they provide a description for microscopic details of 

energy transfer. 

In dilute gases transitions between energy levels are necessarily accompanied by emission or 

absorption  of  electromagnetic  waves  (radiative  optical  transitions).  Purely  nonradiative  transitions 

are possible only if there is some mechanism for transfer of excess energy to or from the external 

(with  respect  to  isolated  molecule)  degrees  of  freedom.  So,  we  arrive  at  the  model  of  molecular 

collisions  with  relative  positions  of  interacting  molecules  as  extra  degrees  of  freedom.  Physically, 

nonradiative transitions represent the second (alternative to emission) channel for deactivation of the 

energy of initial optical excitation, which leads to an increase in ensemble temperature. Therefore, 

such  dissipation  manifests  as  a  degradation  of  the  total  energy  (integral  intensity)  re-emitted  by 

molecules,  rather  than  as  a  change  in  emission  line  shape.  Here  we  pursue  the  goal  of  developing 

theoretical  models  of  nonradiative  transitions  that  would  explain  the  observed  effects  and  provide 

reasonable (at least semi-quantitative) description for them. 

For rare and moderately dense gases, we can rely on the hypothesis of “molecular chaos”, i.e. 

the  absence  of  correlations  between  colliding  molecules,  and  consider  only  pair-wise  molecular 

interactions.  This  model  is  quite  applicable  for  rare  gases,  which  case  we  will  stick  to  in  the 

following,  when  the  mean  free  path  λ  is  much  greater  than  effective  size  of  molecules

.  Without  the  loss  of  generality,  we  will  be  content  with  the 

model of gas being an ensemble of N identical pairs of (different) molecules А–В. In general, while 

further considering multicomponent mixtures, one can separate the ensemble into partial subsystems 

with pair-wise interactions, e.g. for two-component mixtures that would give А–А, В–В and А–В, 

each of which can be treated by the method described below with summation over all subsystems.

). Here we speak of 

translations  only  and  neglect  relative  rotations  with  the  reason  being  that,  due  to  rather  weak 

coupling, the probability of collision energy transfer to rotational degrees of freedom appears much 

lower than to translational ones. Energy re-distribution between translational and rotational modes in 

thermal  equilibrium  can  then  be  estimated  using  the  theorem  of  equipartition  of  energy  among 

degrees of freedom. Thus, we are left with a single coordinate, namely with the distance R between 

centers of mass of molecules A and B, describing their relative motion. 

 

Since we are dealing with collisions, translations should be considered in half-bounded space

to the temperature of ensemble: 

kTM

, where M is the reduced mass of molecules A and B, 

1−= hω

k is the Boltzmann’s constant. Nnorm is just the normalization factor. 

 

The main difficulty with using functions like (5.3), as well as any other functions that model 

molecular  interactions,  is  that  they  cannot  be  normalized  and  corresponding  spectra  is  continuous, 

which  is  characteristic  to  motion  in  half-bounded  space.  This  difficulty  can  be  overcome  if  we 

consider  that  the  potential  and  function  (5.3)  simulate  not  just  the  behavior  of  two  “isolated” 

molecules A and B, but rather interactions and relative motions of any pair of molecules in the media 

(gas) averaged over entire ensemble. In this sense, the distances between A and B do not exceed (in 

average) the mean free path λ and, therefore, the domain for the model function (5.3) is defined by 

< R0

λ≤

,  which  is  equivalent  to  modification  of  the  potential  of  molecular  interactions,  namely: 

within 

< R0

λ<

 it  is  the  Morse  potential,  but  at 

λ>R

 it  goes  to  infinity.  The  discontinuity  that 

appears at 

λ=R

 can be smoothed out in the neighborhood of this point.  

 

We  define  thereby  the  normalizable  function 

TΨ  that  corresponds  to 

THˆ

 and  describes 

relative  translation  of  a  pair  of  molecules.  The  appropriate  choice  of  parameters  in  (5.3)  can  be 

obtained  by  variational  method  for  the  Schrödinger  equation  with  a  given  Morse  potential  so  that 

energies  are  determined  with  ~0.1%    error  bar  [91].  Note,  however,  that,  strictly  speaking,  the 

wavefunction (5.3) is not an eigenfunction of any operator. But this fact is by no means a barrier for 

model  approaches  because  it  is  not  so  important  whether  approximate  potential  or  physically 

meaningful  wavefunction  underlies  the  model  (see  for  example  currently  developing  methods  of 

so-called “intuitive” quantum mechanics [92]). 

It  is  also  assumed  that  intensity  of  incident  radiation  is  low  so  that  all  the  interactions  are 

linear. Then for a given energy level there are only “optical” and “thermal” channels of excitation or 

deactivation and these processes cannot take place simultaneously. In molecular systems transitions 

between  different  states  are  related  to  matrix  elements  of  corresponding  operators.  Optical 
(radiative) transitions are associated with the dipole moment operator µr . Reasoning by analogy, we 

can  introduce  an  operator  of  “thermal”  transitions τˆ  with  matrix  elements  being  essentially  the 

probabilities  of  such  processes.  These  processes 

lead 

to  establishment  of  macroscopic 

thermodynamical  equilibrium,  which  is  an  effect  of  interest  here,  and  increase/decrease  of 

temperature when kinetic thermal energy of molecules is being absorbed/released. Therefore, while 

not  working  out  the  structure  and  details,  we  introduce  operator 

)Rττ ˆ
(
ˆ =

 as  an  operator  of 

translational interaction in the ensemble of colliding molecules that necessarily results in maxwellian 

distribution of velocities. This operator acts on translational wavefunction 

TΨ  yielding 

T ′Ψ  so that 

 

45

the whole set 

{ T ′Ψ for the ensemble of pairs corresponds to equilibrium distribution of velocities at 

}

temperature T ′ , and function 

T ′Ψequ  averaged over all pairs is related to mean parameters of thermal 

motion of molecules (in particular, to mean relative velocity  u ). The dipole moment operator of two 
Bµr  is a function of only internal coordinates 
Aµr  and 

molecules reads as 

r
r
r
A µµµ
B

, where each 

=

+

of molecule A or B, respectively. For neutral molecules, even in case of strong interaction, the dipole 
moment operator µr  is an additive function and is independent of separation between molecules  R . 

Therefore,  the  probability  of  optical  transition  between  states 

1Ψ  and 

2Ψ  is  defined  only  by  the 

matrix

of 

dipole  moment  which

state  (and,  hence,  the  temperature)  is  left  invariable.  Similarly,  the  “thermal”  operator  is 

T

 and  there  are  allowed  “thermal”  transitions  without  a  change  of  internal  molecular 

states.  Consequently, in zero approximation the effects of optical and “thermal” energy exchange in 

gas  are  clearly  separated:  nonradiative  transitions  do  not  occur  upon  optical  excitation,  whereas 

“thermal”  energy  transfer  due  to  collisions  may  take  place  (which  is  observable  as  a  macroscopic 

effect). 

To  account  for  nonradiative  transitions,  we  should  refine  the  model  by  going  to  first 

approximation  that  includes  dependencies  of  electronic  parts  of  adiabatic  wave  functions  upon

negligible)  and  the  diagonal  elements  of  matrix  H  are  just  total  energies  of  the  system  in  zero

In the simplest form of operator

BA

eH ,ˆ∆

dipole-dipole  interaction  and  depends  only  on  mutual  orientation  of  dipoles  and  distance  between 
)kl
them, nondiagonal (with respect to vibronic wavefunctions of A and B) matrix elements (
vanish. Dipole-dipole interactions do not mix electron wavefunctions, no matter whether they belong 

eH ,ˆ∆

BA

 

to  a  single  molecule  or  different  molecules,  i.e.  purely  electron  wavefunctions  do  not  change. 

Indeed, since each molecule is considered a point dipole and all the electrons are found in a uniform 

constant  field,  this  gives  only  an  additive  correction  to  electron  energy.  Therefore,  to  this 

approximation,  the  only  functions  that  mix  are  the  vibrational  wavefunctions  of  A  and  B  and 

translational  functions  (through  operator 

).  This  is  equivalent  to  vibrational  relaxation,  i.e. 

BA

vTH ,ˆ∆

nonradiative (due to collisions) transformation of internal energy of vibrationally excited molecules 

into the energy of thermal motion accompanied by the change in temperature. 

 

For  the  mixing  of  electron  functions  and,  hence,  for  the  electron  relaxation  to  become 

significant,  it  is  necessary  to  take  into  account  mutual  polarizations  of  electron  shells  and 

corresponding  corrections  to  their  wavefunctions.  When  the  dependence  of  electron  functions  on 

mutual orientation of molecules is small, we can stick with the simple expansion:

Small nondiagonal elements of variational matrix H (see (5.8), (5.9) and (5.10)) may result in 

significant  mixing  between  basis  functions  only  when  corresponding  zero  approximation  energy 

levels are in resonance. Under such conditions, population of vibronic states excited due to optical 

dipole  transitions  will  be  accompanied  by  population  of  translational  state  with  big  increment  in 

kinetic energy of relative motion of molecules A and B. This, in turn, will lead to excess number of 

fast  molecules  in  the  medium  (compared  to  equilibrium  distribution  at  temperature  0T ).  Collisions 

will dissipate these fluctuations into new equilibrium state of the gas at higher temperature 

T >
1 T
0

. 

So, part of absorbed radiation energy will be converted to thermal energy of molecular motion.  

Consider  this  in  more  detail.  Let’s  assume  that  the  system  is  in  thermal  equilibrium  at 

temperature 

T =′

 and  all  N  pairs  of  molecules  are  in  averaged  Ψ′  state  which  is  essentially  the 

0T

combination of molecular ground states 

Ψ′ ,

A Ψ′

B

 and translational state 

TΨ′

. This means that all pairs are treated indistinguishable with respect to 

their  translational  dynamics  averaged  over  statistical  ensemble.  As  noted  above,  this  allow  to 

introduce the constraint 

< R0

λ<

 for translations and define function 

TΨ′

 at temperature T′ .  

To not complicate the discussion, we will assume that initial states do not mix and write them 

Suppose  further  that  only  molecule  A  is  initially  excited  and  take  the  mix  of  two  resonant  energy

Here we see how the model of molecular interactions describes nonradiative transformation 

of  absorbed  energy  into  thermal  energy  of  chaotic  motion.  As  a  consequence,  the  fluorescence 

quantum yield will be less than unity, which is observed in the experiments. The proposed approach 

enables  to  make  quantitative  estimates  for  nonradiative  effects,  since  all  matrix  elements  and 

coefficients  in  model  operators  can  be  easily  calculated.  Note  that  other  cases  of  mixing  between 

molecular states can be examined in a similar way. Consider, for example, states with wavefunctions

an approach to nonradiative vibrational relaxation of excited vibronic state, while the second deals

with  electron  relaxation.  Both  types  of  relaxation  can  be  observed  experimentally  and  described 

qualitatively by Vavilov’s law and Kasha’s rule, respectively. 

Despite  the  fact  that  we  have  used  restricted  “two-level”  approximation  for  simplicity,  the 

method  is  applicable  to  “multilevel”  mixing  due  to  complex  molecular  interactions  too.  This, 

however,  implies  diagonalization  of  full  variational  matrix,  which  in  no  way  represents  a  serious 

computational  problem  even  for  a  big  number  of  mixing  vibronic  states  and  high  dimensional 

matrices  [93].  It  is  also  noteworthy  for  future  studies  and  possible  applications  that  the  model  of 

interactions  between  molecules  in  gases  considered  herein  can  be  naturally  incorporated  into 

methods and software developed for simulations of dynamical time-resolved spectra.  

Conclusions 

We have considered recent advances and applications in the adiabatic semiempirical theory 

of  vibronic  spectra,  along  with  major  features  of  the  parametric  method  and  associated 

computational techniques that now extend to time-resolved studies of polyatomic molecules, isomer 

transformations and nonradiative processes. Indeed, extensive computer simulations and approaches 

to inverse problems will be expected to fill the gap between purely theoretical molecular models and 

increasingly  sophisticated  spectral  experiments,  which,  in  any  case,  can  give  only  indirect 

information on properties and dynamics of excited states. It is also clear that current models should 

eventually  give  way  to  more  accurate  approximations  (for  example,  nonadiabatic  theory,  full 

treatment  of  time-dependent  problem,  etc.),  but  there  will  still  be  a  challenge  for  maintaining 

intuitive description and clarity.

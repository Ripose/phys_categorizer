Abstract:  We  present  an  analysis  of  quantum-limited  DPSK  receivers  with  optical 
Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) demodulation. It is shown for the first time that the 
quantum  limits  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  single-port  and  balanced  detections 
exactly differ from 3-dB in receiver sensitivity, obtained by both Poisson and Gaussian 
noise statistics. The quantum limit for DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection is

1.    Introduction 

DPSK receivers, determined by 

The  differential  phase  shifted  keying  (DPSK)  modulation  has  been  attracted  great 
attention  for 
its  application  for  dense  wavelength  division  multiplexing  (DWDM) 
transmission since DPSK with optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) demodulation and 
balanced  detection  provides 
intensity 
several  advantages  over 
modulation/direction  detection  (IM/DD)  [1].  The  quantum  limited  receiver  sensitivity  of 
(
i.e. average photon number (bits “1” and “0” carry the same signal energy in DPSK signal) 
and BER- bit error ratio, has been widely used for DPSK/MZI receivers with both single-port 
and  balanced  detections  [1-2].  The  above  quantum  limit  was  obtained  for  DPSK  with 
electrical  demodulation (referred  to  the  conventional  DPSK receivers), which  consists  of  an 
electrical  time  delay  line  and  a  mixer,  based  on  the  noise  statistics  of  Rice  (bit  “1”)  and 
Rayleigh  (bit  “0”)  distributions  [3-4].  However,  the  MZI  (in  DSPK  with  optical  MZI 
demodulation)  converts  DPSK  optical  signal  into  intensity  modulated  optical  signal  before

input  to  the  optical  photodiodes,  which  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Consequently  the  electrical 
processing of DPSK signal/noise in optical receivers is the same as in IM/DD receivers, rather 
than the conventional DPSK receivers. The noise statistic of quantum noise (i.e. shot noise) in 
DPSK  receivers  with  optical  MZI  demodulation  is  not  the  Rice  and  Rayleigh  probability 
distributions;  instead  the  Gaussian/Poisson  noise  distribution  should  be  used  as  in  IM/DD 
receivers [5]. Moreover, the DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection could be different 
from DPSK/MZI receivers with single-port detection in quantum limited receiver sensitivity, 
because  the  signal  energy  used  for  error  detection  is  different  in  the  two  detections. 
Consequently,  it  could  be  expected  that  the  quantum  limited  BER  in  DPSK/MZI  receivers 
with single-port and balanced detections may be different from that of the conventional DPSK 
receivers. In this paper, we present a quantum limited analysis for DPSK receiver with optical 
MZI demodulation and single-port and balanced detections.

2.    Definitions of quantum and quasi-quantum noise 

When  quantum  noise  is  only  considered,  a  small  number  of  photons  and  electron-hole 
pairs  present  (i.e.,  the  number  of  photons  and  electrons  are  countable).  The  noise  statistics 
(only  quantum  noise  is  taken  into  account)  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  should  follow  the 
Poisson  distribution  (a  discrete  probability  distribution)  as  in  IM/DD  receivers  [5].  As  the 
number  of  photons  and  electrons  becomes  large  enough,  the  noise  statistics  become  the 
Gaussian  distribution  (a  continuous  probability  distribution).  In  this  paper,  quasi-quantum 
limited (QQL) analysis is referred if the quantum noise is considered to be the Gaussian noise, 
to  distinguish  it  from  the  quantum  limited  (QL)  analysis  in  which  the  quantum  noise  is 
considered to be Poisson noise. For the conventional DPSK receivers, the BER expression of

N   [3-5]  is  corresponding  to  our  defined  quasi-quantum  limited  analysis 

because the continuous Rice and Rayleigh noise statistics are used.   
 
3.    Quantum limited analysis 

We  first  analyze  the  quantum  limited  (Poisson  noise  statistics)  DPSK  receivers  with 
optical MZI demodulation. We first consider DPSK/MZI receivers with single-port detection.

pN - the photon number in bit “1”, and corresponding 
to the average optical power of the DPSK signal), no errors from bit “1” occur. Since bit “0” 
has zero photons and noise free, bit “0” is not detectable and BER is totally determined by bit 
  the  number  of  electron-hole  pairs  in  bit 
“1”  similar  to  IM/DD  receivers  [5]  (Note

N ,  the  peak  power  of  bit  “1”  in  IM/DD  is  assumed  twice  the 

average power of DPSK signal and thus total signal energy carried by IM and DPSK signals 
is the same). This can be explained that only the half signal energy is used for error detection 
in DPSK/MZI receivers with single-port detection rather than the full signal energy in IM/DD 
receivers. The result indicated by (1) is already given in [5, Table 10.2] for the conventional 
DPSK receivers.   

For DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection, the bits “1” and “0” contain the same 
  electron-hole pairs 

number of photons. When bit “1” transmitted, no errors occur if

The  factor  1/2  is  due  to  two  bits.  By  comparing  (1)  and  (2),  we  can  find  that  the  3-dB

detection  over  single-port  detection.  On  the  other  hand,  the  same  quantum  limit  by

is because the two receivers use the same signal energy for error detection. The expression (2) 
for DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection is given for the first time. It is shown that 
the  quantum  limits  are  different  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  single-port  and  balanced 
detections. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use the expression (1) for DPSK/MZI receivers 
pNη   should replace 
with balanced detection [1-2]. If non-ideal photodiodes are considered, 
pN   in (1) and (2),  η- the quantum efficiency of the photodiodes.   

Furthermore,  it  is  observed  that  the  expression  (1)  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with 
single-port  detection  is  the  same  as  the  conventional  DPSK  receivers.  However  the  BER 
given by (1) is obtained based on the discrete Poisson distribution, rather than the continuous 
Rice  and  Rayleigh  distributions.  Particularly, 
the 
(

DPSK  receivers  [1-2],  only  applies  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  single-port  detection  and 
the conventional DPSK receivers. Additionally, the 3-dB difference of receiver sensitivity by 
(1) and (2) agrees well with the signal constellation which is shown in Fig. 2 [1]. In Fig. 2(a),

receivers are given. The distance between bits “1” and “0” in electric field is assumed  x   for 
2x   for 
DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  single-port  detection.  Thus,  the  distance  becomes 
IM/DD  receivers.  Therefore,  IM/DD  receivers  outperform  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  the 
single-port detection by 3 dB. Fig. 2(b) depicts the signal constellations for IM/DD receivers 
and DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection. It is shown that the distances between bits 
“1”  and  “0”  are  the  same  for  the  two  receivers.  Therefore,  IM/DD  receivers  have  the  same 
quantum limited performance as DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection.

4.    Quasi-quantum limited analysis 

We  now  start  the  analysis  for  the  quasi-quantum  limited  (Gaussian  noise  statistics) 
DPSK receivers with optical MZI demodulation. First let’s consider the DPSK/MZI receivers 
with  single-port  detection.  The  decision  current 
  for  bit  “1”  is  corresponding  to  the

IM/DD [5],

In (4) the same conditions as in (3) have been applied in the last step. By comparing (3) and 
(4), we have found that BER given by (3) and (4) differs from 3-dB in receiver sensitivity. In 
other words, the 3-dB receiver sensitivity is improved by DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced 
detection  over  single-port  detection  in  the  quasi-quantum  limit.  On  the  other  hand, 
DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  has  the  same  quantum  limit  as  IM/DD 
receivers, since the total signal energy, used for error detection in DPSK/MZI receivers with 
balanced detection,  is  exactly  the  same  as  in IM/DD  receivers.  The  BER  expressions of  (3)

and  (4)  are  different  from  the  expression  of

the 3-dB receiver sensitivity difference in (3) and (4) can be easily interpreted by the signal 
constellation in Fig. 2. 
 
5.    Conclusion 

We  have  presented  an  analysis  of  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  single-port  and  balanced 
detections,  considering  the  quantum  noise  only.  We  have  found  that  3-dB  quantum  limit  is 
improved by DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection over single-port detection. This is 
simply because only the half signal energy is used for error detection in single-port detection. 
Moreover,  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  has  the  same  quantum  limit  as 
IM/DD  receivers  rather  than  3-dB  lower,  since  the  total  signal  energy  for  error  detection  in 
DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection and IM/DD receivers is the same. The quantum

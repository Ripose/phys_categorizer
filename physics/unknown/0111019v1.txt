I. Introduction 

 

Photophysical  properties  of  triacarbocynine  dye  in  solvents  have  motivated  a 

large 

amount 

of 

scientific  work 

recent 

years[1~5]. 

 

5,5’-dichloro-11- 

diphenylamine-3,3’-diethyl-10,12-ethylene-thiatricarbocyanine-perchlorate(IR-140) 

as  one  kind  of 

triacarbocynine  dye, 

the  photophysical  properties  and 

photoisomerization  processes  have  also  considerably  gained 

interesting[6~8]. 

Especially, the photoisomerization of IR-140 in ethanol and in DMSO had been firstly 

studied  by  J.P.Fouassier  et.al  in  1977[6].    In  1998,  Y.H.Meyer  et.al  was  explained 

photoisomer process and forecasted the excited-state absorption of IR-140 by global 

spectral analysis  [1]. Then recently, J.C.Gumy et.al studied the solvation dynamics of 

IR-140  in  polar  solvents  using  the femtosecond  transient  grating  technique[8]  .  They 

observed the solvation dynamics was dependent on the probe wavelengths: at 830nm, 

the diffusive motion is major element while at 780nm the dynamics is dominated by 

the inertial motion (intramolecular charge transfer process).     

 In this paper we report the pump supercontinuum-probing (PSCP) measurements 

on  the  transient  absorption  spectrum  and  transient  relaxation  of  IR-140  in  polar 

solvents and nonpolar solvents with a time resolution of 130fs and probe wavelength 

ranging  from  400nm  to  1000nm.  As  the  femtosecond  PSCP  technique  has  broad 

spectral  coverage  and  high  time  resolution  [9-11],  more  information  about  the  energy 

structure  of  IR-140  can  be  obtained  from  its  transient  spectra.  Meanwhile,  the 

photophysical properties about the probe wavelength dependence of the dye IR-140 in 

variational  solvents  is  fully  proved.  More  information  about  the  photoismerization 

process  of  IR-140  was  obtained  from  its  transient  spectra  and  more  detailed  energy 

structure of IR-140 was firstly reported. 

 

 

II.  Experimental Setup 

The  experimental  setup  for  PSCP  was  based  on  a  Ti:  Sapphire  chirped-pulse 

amplification  CPA  system.  The  laser  system  (TSA-10,  Spectra-Physics,  USA) 

delivered  807nm  wavelength  laser  pulses  with  repetition  rate  of  10  Hz  and  pulse 

duration  of  130  fs.  The  maximum  pulse  energy  was  up  to  10  mJ.  The  experimental 

setup  for  measuring  the  optical  transient  relaxation  of  the  dye  IR-140  is  shown  in 

Fig.1. The laser pulse was split into two parts by a beamsplitter (BS). The transmitted 

beam, after passing a variable optical delay line (ODL) controlled by a computer, was 

used for optical pumping. The pump beam had a diameter of 2mm on the sample and 

the  pulse  intensity  can  be  varied  from  0.1mJ  to  10uJ  by  rotating  a  half-wavelength 

plate in front of a polarizer. The reflected beam, with an energy of about 1.0mJ, was 

focused with a 6.5-cm lens (L1) into distilled water to generate supercontinuum probe 

pulses.  The  center  part  of  the  supercontinuum,  with  an  energy  of  1.0uJ,  was 

converged  by  dispersion-free  concave  mirror  with  metal  coating  and  reflected  by  a 

fused silica plate (P) with thickness of about 4-mm. The reflected probe beam from 

the  front  surface,  called  as  probe  beam  1,  was  focused  to  intersect  with  the  pump 

beam in the sample solution and to detect dynamic absorption changes caused by the 

pump beam. The reflected probe beam from the rear surface of the plate, probe beam 

2, was used as the reference to monitor the energy fluctuation of probe 1. The sample 

solution  with  concentration  of  1×10-5  M  was  filled  in  a  2mm  thickness  glass  cell 

resulting  in  the  initial  absorption  about  50%  at  807nm.  After  interaction  with  the 

sample,  the  transmitted  probe  beam  were  input  into  a  fiber  spectrometer  (PC2000, 

Ocean  Optics,  Inc.)  and  displayed  in  the  computer.  The  transient  absorption 

spectroscopy was detected by changing the optical delay of the probe with respected

near-infrared(NIR).     

The molecular structure of IR-140 is shown in Fig. 2. It is a triacarbocynine dye 

with extended polymethine chains and exhibit absorption and emission maxima in the 

The  steady-state  absorption  spectra  were  measured  in  polar  solvents  such  as 

alcoholic  solvents  and  nonpolar  solvents  such  as  chloroform,  tetrahydrofuran  etc. 

which  is  shown  in  Table  1.  Noticeably,  the  position  of  the  absorption  maximum  is 

shifted to shorter wavelengths with increasing the polarization of the solvents. That is, 

the maximal absorption is 799 in methanol while shifts to 820nm in Benzene. On the 

other hand, the emission spectra of IR-140 in ethanol which excited at 810nm can be 

deconvoluted into two components: one centered at 823nm and the other centered at 

840nm which shown in Fig.3. The similar results can be obtained in other solvents.

Thus,  the  spectra  shifts  and  the  two  components  in  the  emission  spectra  can  be 

attributed to existence of conformation change according to the Ref.[12] and Ref.[3]: 

one is the all-trans and the other is mono-cis.    In order to analyze the photophysical 

properties  of  IR-140  in  the  round,  we  investigated  the  transient  relaxation  and 

transient  spectra  of  IR-140  in  different  solvents  by  PSCP  technique.  When  near 

infrared pump pulses 807nm resonantly excited the sample, the time-resolved signals 

as  a  function  of  the  delay  time  and  probe  wavelength  can  be  investigated.  In  our 

pervious paper[13], from the transient absorption and gain spectra of IR-140 in ethanol 

at different time intervals, we reported the negative signal (

650

nm

> λ

>

500

nm

) - the 

first excited-state absorption (ESA) was corresponding to the transition from the S1 to 

Sn  .  While  according  to  the  positive  signal(for 

900

nm

> λ

>

720

nm

),  we  have 

hypothesized there existed an isomerization process in the wavelengths covering from 

720nm to 850nm. Now we compared the transient transmission spectra of IR-140 in 

polar solvent (such as ethanol) and in nonpolar solvent (such as benzene) at different 

time  intervals  in  Fig.4.  The  positive  signal  exhibit  red  shift  and  there  is  a  new 

absorption band appearing which centers around at 820nm in benzene while it is not 

obvious  in  ethanol(denoted  by  the  arrow  in  Fig.4).  Considering  the  new  absorption 

band  in  the  nonpolar  solvent-benzene,  we  can  mainly  ascribe  the  spectroscopic 

difference to the different isomerization rates between the cis and trans conformation 

of IR-140 in thus two kinds of solvents when we ignore the intersyestem crossing in 

triacabocyanine dye and triplet-triplet absorption of the first singlet excited state[2,14] 

because of  the low  quantum  efficiency(<10-3). The  investigation  shows  the different 

of isomerization rates may mainly originate from following effects. First, because the 

isomeriazation  process  involves  torsional  motion  about  the  polymethine  chain, 

according  to  J.P.Fouassier  et.al[4],  but  the  polymethine  chain  is  easier  to  rigid  with 

increasing  the  polarity  of  the  solvents  then  result  in  the  nonradiative  efficiency  of 

IR-140 will be lower than in the low-polar solvents[2]. That is, the isomerization rates 

will be increased with decreasing the polarization  solvents. The second  effect might 

be due to ion-pairing between the dye and its counterion[3,15]. In low-polarity solvents, 

the dye, bearing an overall negative charge, will most likely be paired with positively 

charged  counterion.  This  should  force  the  equilibrium  toward  the  all-trans 

conformation  while  in  polar  solvents  the  unpaired  dye  would  adopt  mono-cis 

conformation. In a word, all of the effects show that the isomerization rate of IR-140 

is  lower  in  the  more  polar  solvents  which  is  consistent  with  the  results  that 

isomerization efficiency of another tricabocyanine dye DCM is very low in the more 

polar  solvent[16].  According  to  the  authors  such  as  West  et.al[17],  the  blue-absorbing 

species  could  be  assigned  to  the  cis  isomer  and  red-absorbing  one  to  the  all-trans. 

Thus, we can tell from our transient spectra in Fig.4. that the new absorption band in 

benzene  should  be  assigned  as  the  cis  isomer.  Therefore,  we  can  explain  the  higher 

rate of the cis isomer in the nonpolar solvent resulting in the spectroscopic difference 

of IR-140 which wavelengths ranging from 720nm to 850nm.   

Then  considering  the  red-shift  of  the  absorption  spectra  in  nonpolar  solvents 

compared to polar solvents, according to D.Noukakis et.al[3] and J.C.Gumy et al[8], we 

can  conclude  that  the  position  of  the  absorption  maximum  is  shifted  to  longer 

wavelengths  by  dispersive  interactions  between  the  transition  dipole  of  the  dye  and 

the electronic polarizability of the solvent. And the different proportion between the 

inertial  motion  (intramolecular  charge  transfer  process)  and  diffusional  motion  can 

also  result  in  the  spectral  shifts.  Because  the  solvent  configuration  for  the  red  side 

involve  more  diffusional  motion  than  the  configurations  corresponding  to  blue  side 

absorption. Thus can explain why the absorption band of IR-140 is shifted to a shorter 

wavelength as the polarity of the solvent increases.   

Linking  with  our  pervious  paper[13]  and  comparing  the  transient  dynamics  of 

IR-140 in polar solvents with in nonpolar solvents. The relaxation can also be fitted 

by  double-exponent  process  and  the  delay  time  is  probe  wavelength-dependent  no 

matter  what  the  solvent  is  polar  or  nonpolar.  At  the  same  time,  the  generating 

mechanism  of  ESA  (excited-state  absorption)  and  SE  (stimulated  emission)  is 

dominated by linear absorption of 807nm which was already proved in our pervious 

paper[13]. But the delay time is observed to be also solvent-polarity dependence except 

for  the  wavelength-dependent  in  this  paper.  For  example,  in  benenze,  the  time 

constant  at  830nm  is

=

99.0

±

(14.0

ps

),

τ

(07.0

;  In  tetrahyadrofuran, 

the delay time is shorter than benenze because of its dielectric constant smaller than 

benenze if we ignored the effect of viscosity (the viscosity of benenze is 0.604 while 

the  tehrahyadrofuran  is  0.456).  On  average,  the  delay  time  in  low-polar  solvent  is 

shorter than in the alcoholic solvents, which is content with the report that Jean-Pierre 

Fouassier  et  al[6]  observed  the  fluorescence  lifetime  was  shortened  in  ethanol 

(

00.25=ε

) than in DMSO(

7.46=ε

). The contrast of the time constant at 840nm in 

different kinds of solvents is shown in Table 2.

The  different  delay  time  in  varied  solvents  can  also  prove  the  isomerization 

process of IR-140. That is, the fluorescence lifetime is shortened with increasing the 

rate of the isomerization.   

 In a word, we obtain the energy-band structure of IR-140 in more detail which is 

shown  in  Fig.5.  according  to  the  solvation  dynamics  and  isomerization  process  of 

IR-140.  In  Fig.5,  when  the  807nm  laser  pulses  excited  linearly  the  IR-140,  the 

excited-state absorption was generated from S1 to Sn centering at 550nm. At the same 

time, the first excited singlet state is twisted by rotating the polymethine chain which 

caused  trans→cis  isomerization  process  and  the  center  of  isomer  absorption  was 

about  at  820nm.  According  to  the  spectral  shifts  and  the  different  dynamics  in 

different  solvents,  we  can  tell  that  the  cis  isomer  conformation  is  dominant  by  the 

wavelengths in the range from 820nm to 900m while the wavelengths ranging from 

720nm to 820nm is corresponding to the molecular conformation of the all-trans. 

 

IV.  Conclusion 

In  summary,  the  solvation  dynamics  and  isomerization  process  of  the  dye 

IR-140  were  investigated  by  using  pump  supercontinuum-probing(PSCP)  technique 

with  130fs  time  resolution  and  probe  wavelengths  from  400nm  to  1000nm.  We 

observed  the  different  transient  spectra  and  spectral  shift  in  polar  and  nonpolar 

solvents.  The  solvent-dependent  transient  spectra  is  considered  to  be  due  to  tran-cis 

isomerization in the first excited singlet state twist form because of the rotation of the 

polymethine chain and ion-pairing effect. On the other hand, the spectral shift can be 

ascribed  to  dispersive  interactions  between  the  transition  dipole  of  the  dye  and  the 

electronic  polarizability  of  the  solvent  and  different  solvent  configurations  with 

different  dynamics.  The  transient  relaxation  between  the  two  kinds  of  solvents  was 

also investigated at the same time. In this paper, we not only approved the results in 

our  pervious  paper  but  also  obtained  the  more  detailed  energy  band  of  the  IR-140 

based on the spectral shifts and photoisomerization process. All of above investigation 

provide us an ingelligible image about the photophysical process of IR-140 and also 

help  us  understand  clearly  the  photophysics  properties,  photoisomerization  and 

dye-solvent actions in the other large organic tricabocyanine dyes.

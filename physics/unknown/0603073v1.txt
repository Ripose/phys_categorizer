In a typical optical tweezers detection system, the position of a trapped object is determined from
laser light impinging on a quadrant photodiode. When the laser is infrared and the photodiode is of
silicon, they can act together as an unintended low-pass (cid:12)lter. This parasitic e(cid:11)ect is due to the high
transparency of silicon to near-infrared light. A simple model that accounts for this phenomenon
(Berg-S(cid:28)rensen et al., J. Appl. Phys., 93, 3167{3176 (2003)) is here solved for frequencies up to
100 kHz, and for laser wavelengths between 750 and 1064 nm. The solution is applied to experimental
data in the same range, and is demonstrated to give this detection system of optical tweezers a
bandwidth, accuracy, and precision that is limited only by the data acquisition board’s band-width
and bandpass ripples, here 96.7 kHz, resp. 0.005 dB.

INTRODUCTION

Photodiode-based detection systems are used in a
number of modern techniques, ranging from detection
of the cantilever de(cid:13)ection in atomic force microscopes
[1, 2], over detection schemes coupled to optical tweezers
[3{5, and references therein], to equipment used in high-
energy physics particle detectors [6, 7]. When common
Si-PIN diodes are used to detect 1064 nm laser light, over
50% loss of signal is seen for frequencies above approx-
imately 10 kHz [8{11], and the loss is detectable from
approximately 1 kHz [11].

This loss in signal power has a characteristic function
similar to that of a low-pass (cid:12)lter, and is caused by light
absorption in the n-layer of the diode. Its physics was
explained and modeled mathematically in [10, 11]. The
model was demonstrated to account fully for the phe-
nomenon up to the 25 kHz Nyquist frequency used, and
the resulting theory for the power spectrum agrees with
the experimental spectrum to within the 1% stochastic
error on the latter. The various degrees of loss in signal
power was demonstrated in [12] for photo detectors made
from di(cid:11)erent materials, including a specialized Si-diode,
and for a range of laser wavelengths.

In the present paper, the model proposed in [10] is used

to account for this parasitic (cid:12)ltering for power spectral
frequencies up to 90 kHz, for various laser wavelengths.
The position detection system consists of a tunable laser
used in conjunction with a Si-PIN diode and (cid:1)-(cid:6) data
acquisition electronics with sampling frequency 195 kHz.
The signal analyzed is the position of a micro-sphere do-
ing Brownian motion in a liquid while being held in an op-
tical trap. We thus extend the useful power-spectral fre-
quency range in optical tweezers experiments to the max-
imum set by our data acquisition electronics. This en-
larged bandwidth is of relevance to experiments in, e.g.,
single molecule biophysics [13] and microrheology [8, 14{
16], as was recently demonstrated in [15] for a smaller
frequency range. In the larger frequency range recorded
here, parasitic (cid:12)ltering is stronger, so its modelling is
more demanding, but not complicated, as we show. Thus
the calibration procedure demonstrated here makes op-
tical tweezers a tool of accuracy and precision with sig-
ni(cid:12)cantly higher bandwidth than before.

The paper is organized as follows: Section II brie(cid:13)y
describes the experimental procedure. Section III gives
the necessary formulas from physics and power spectrum
analysis. Section IV analyzes the physics of the detection
system. Section V explains how the model parameters of
the photodiode detection system are determined experi-
mentally. Sections VI and VII describe our data analysis
and experimental results, respectively. Section VIII con-
tains our conclusions.

II. EXPERIMENTS

A. The Einstein-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck theory of
Brownian motion

2

We measured the Brownian motion of optically
trapped microscopic beads in water by back-focal-plane
interferometry [4]. We repeated these measurements at
a number of trapping laser wavelength. We used silica
beads with a diameter of 900 nm (Bangs Laboratories,
Fishers, IN) dispersed in water. Beads were diluted typi-
cally to a concentration of 10(cid:0)6 w/v and introduced into
a sample chamber made of a cover-slip and a microscope
slide glued together with double-stick tape. Beads were
trapped (cid:24)10 (cid:22)m above the cover-slip/water interface to
minimize their hydrodynamic interaction with the inter-
face.

The custom-built instrument used for the experiments
is based on a continuous-wave Ti:Sapphire laser (Mira
900F with a triple-plate birefringent (cid:12)lter, pumped by a
Verdi V10 frequency-doubled Nd:YVO4 laser, Coherent
Inc., Santa Clara, Ca.), tunable from 730 to 1000 nm.
The collimated beam from this laser is expanded 9 times
and focused to a di(cid:11)raction limited spot in the sample
with a high-numerical-aperture microscope objective (S
Fluor, 100x, NA 1.3, Nikon Corp., Kanagawa, Japan).
The detection optics of the setup consist of a high-
numerical-aperture condenser (Achromat/Aplanat, NA
1.4, Nikon) to collect the trapping laser light, with the
back-focal plane of the condenser imaged onto a silicon
quadrant photodiode (SPOT 9-DMI, UDT, Hawthorne,
CA) operated at 15 V reversed bias. We also repeated
these measurements with a largely identical setup, but
with a di(cid:11)erent laser, a 1064 nm laser (Nd:YVO4, Com-
pass 1064-4000 M, Coherent Inc.) [17].

The signals from the four quadrants of the diode
were ampli(cid:12)ed by low-noise, high-bandwidth preampli-
(cid:12)ers (custom built) and the distribution of light on the
diode was calculated by an analog normalizing di(cid:11)eren-
tial ampli(cid:12)er (custom built) [17]. The signals were then
digitized with an A/D-board sampling at 195 kHz per
channel (AD16 board on a ChicoPlus PC-card, Innova-
tive Integration, Simi Valley, CA). This board is based
on (cid:1)-(cid:6) conversion technology [18]. This implies over-
sampling of the signal and no external anti-aliasing (cid:12)lters
are needed. The speci(cid:12)ed 3dB-frequency of the board is
0.496(cid:2)fsample, in our case 96.7 kHz.

Time series of approximately 8 million points were
recorded using custom-written LabView software (Na-
tional Instruments, Austin, TX).

III. TRAPPED BEAD’S BROWNIAN MOTION
IN LIQUID

To make the present paper self-contained with respect
to key formulae, we give those here in the notation used
in [11] where more details are given.

The Einstein-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck theory describes the
Brownian motion of a spherical bead trapped in a har-
monic potential with three identical, uncoupled Langevin
equations, one for each of the bead’s cartesian coordi-
nates (x(t); y(t); z(t)) [19]. For the x-coordinate, this
equation reads

m(cid:127)x(t) + (cid:13)0 _x(t) + (cid:20)x(t) = (2kBT (cid:13)0)

2 (cid:17)(t) :

(1)

1

Here, m is the mass of the bead, (cid:13)0 its friction coe(cid:14)cient,
(cid:0)(cid:20)x(t) the harmonic force from the trap, and the random
thermal forces from the surrounding liquid are modelled
with the term (2kBT (cid:13)0)
2 (cid:17)(t), a white-noise random pro-
2 . The
cess with explicitly written amplitude (2kBT (cid:13)0)
stochastic process (cid:17)(t) has vanishing mean and a delta-
function as auto-correlation function. Stokes law for a
spherical particle gives

1

1

(cid:13)0 = 6(cid:25)(cid:26)(cid:23)R

(2)

where (cid:26)(cid:23) is the liquid’s shear viscosity, (cid:26) the liquid’s
density, (cid:23) its kinematic viscosity, and R the radius of the
spherical particle.

As a model for Brownian motion in a liquid, the
Einstein-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck theory is only valid as a
low-frequency approximation. It ignores that the friction
coe(cid:14)cient is frequency dependent, when the hydrody-
namics of the surrounding liquid is taken into account. At
frequencies low enough to make the Einstein-Ornstein-
Uhlenbeck theory an acceptable approximation, its in-
ertial term, m(cid:127)x, can be left out to an even better ap-
proximation, which leaves us with the original Einstein
theory from 1905. Thus, the only use we have for the
Einstein-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck theory here, is to establish
the connection between Newton’s Second Law, Eq. (1),
and Einstein’s approximate theory for Brownian motion.

B. Power spectrum of Einstein’s theory of
Brownian motion

Einstein’s theory results in a Lorentzian power spec-

trum [20, 21] for the motion,

Here h: : :i denotes expectation value, P (ex) denotes ex-
perimental power spectral values, the corner frequency
fc (cid:17) (cid:20)=(2(cid:25)(cid:13)0) has been introduced, and Einstein’s rela-
tion D = kBT =(cid:13)0 between di(cid:11)usion constant, Boltzmann
energy, and friction coe(cid:14)cient, has been used. The dis-
crete frequency fk (cid:17) k=tmsr with k integer and tmsr the
duration of the time interval on which x(t) is Fourier
transformed. Here we have used the same normalization
of the power spectrum as in [11, Eqs. (7{8)]. There, it

was also shown that P (ex)
is exponentially distributed,
with expectation value given in Eq. (3) and, as is always
the case for exponential distributions, with root-mean-
square-deviation equal to its mean,

C. Hydrodynamically correct power spectrum of
Brownian motion in liquid

The power spectrum of classical Brownian motion in
a liquid is known beyond the approximate Einstein-
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck theory.
It is known exactly in the
limit of vanishing Reynolds number, which limit is an ex-
tremely good approximation for classical Brownian mo-
tion [11]. We use this result to analyze the experimental
power spectrum in its entire frequency range. By doing so
we account for the frequency-dependence of viscous fric-
tion, for the frequency-dependence of the inertial mass
of entrained liquid, for the bead’s inertial mass, and for
the (cid:12)nite distance ‘ between the center of the bead and
the surface of the experimental chamber. The frequency-
dependent extra friction experienced by the bead as re-
sult of its hydrodynamical interaction with this surface is
known only approximately, but to a very good approxi-
mation. This is all done by replacing the power spectrum
in Eq. (3) with the expression [11, 22, 23],

In these expressions, two new characteristic frequen-
cies have been introduced: f(cid:23) is the frequency at which
the penetration depth in the liquid of the bead’s lin-
ear harmonic motion equals the radius of the bead,
f(cid:23) (cid:17) (cid:23)=((cid:25)R2) = 1:6 MHz. The penetration depth
(cid:14)(f ) = ((cid:23)=(cid:25)f )1=2 characterizes the exponential decrease
of the (cid:13)uid’s velocity (cid:12)eld as a function of the distance
from a bead that is forced to do linear harmonic mo-
tion with frequency f . The other characteristic fre-
quency is fm (cid:17) (cid:13)0=(2(cid:25)m) = 1:6 MHz where m is the
mass of the bead. The numerical values given here for
these frequencies are for silica beads of R = 450 nm in
water, and the two numerical values are equal because
fm=f(cid:23) = 9(cid:26)=(4(cid:26)bead) and (cid:26)=(cid:26)bead ’ 4=9 in the present
case of a silica bead in water.

FIG. 1: Three experimental power spectra, taken with
roughly equal trap strengths, using three di(cid:11)erent laser wave-
lengths, 800 nm, 900 nm, and 1000 nm. Panel A: Power spec-
trum P (f ) versus frequency f . The solid line corresponds
to P (f ) / f (cid:0)2, the behavior of a Lorentzian at large fre-
quencies, and serves to guide the eye. Above approximately
5 kHz, the power spectrum taken with the 1000 nm laser drops
o(cid:11) faster than the other two spectra, though it describes the
same physical phenomenon. This faster drop-o(cid:11) is similar to
the e(cid:11)ect of a low-order low-pass (cid:12)lter. Panel B: Same data
plotted as f 2P (f ) versus frequency f to better display the (cid:12)l-
ter e(cid:11)ect. The laser wavelength-dependence of the (cid:12)lter e(cid:11)ect
shows that its cannot be explained by the physics of Brown-
ian motion. The physics of the position detection system is
responsible.

This theory of trapped Brownian motion does not de-
pend on the wavelength (cid:21) of the trapping laser. Nev-
ertheless, the recorded power spectra depend on (cid:21), as
illustrated in Fig. 1.

Equation (5) describes the physical power spectrum.
A (cid:12)t of it to data obtained with (cid:21) = 900 nm is plotted in
Fig. 2. As demonstrated in Fig. 2’s Panel B, the physi-
cal power spectrum di(cid:11)ers from the recorded power spec-
trum. This discrepancy is caused by the position detec-
tion system, which low-pass (cid:12)lters the position signal, as
described below.

a much lower absorption coe(cid:14)cient.
It penetrates into
the substrate of the diode (commonly an n-layer), creates
charge carriers also there, and these reach the depletion
layer by di(cid:11)usion only, thereby causing a delayed signal.
(Only holes are taken into account to model the delayed
signal, as argued in [10].)

The diode is very (cid:13)at, its xy-dimensions being much
larger than its z-dimension. We need only consider di(cid:11)u-
sive motion and only in the z-direction: Signi(cid:12)cant con-
centration gradients of holes, hence signi(cid:12)cant transport
of these by di(cid:11)usion, are found only in the z-direction,
because holes are removed only in the depletion zone.
Recombination of holes with conduction electrons can be
ignored to a very good approximation on the time scales
and with the level of precision considered here.

A. Di(cid:11)usion equation

dard deviation, according to the theory for how the data,
shown as dots, should scatter about their expectation value 1.

IV. THE SI-PIN DIODE

Light detection with a photodiode can be modelled as
follows [10]: A typical construction of a Si-PIN photodi-
ode is illustrated in Fig. 3. The p- and n-layers are es-
sentially (cid:12)eld free, while there is an electrical (cid:12)eld across
the depletion zone. The nanosecond response time of the
photodiode given by its manufacturer is reached when all
photons are absorbed in the depletion zone, a few tens
of microns into the material. This is the case for visible
light. Light with longer wavelengths, however, has pho-
ton energies near or below the band gap in silicon, hence

where D is the thermal di(cid:11)usion coe(cid:14)cient of holes. In
pure silicon, D = 12.9 cm2/s at room temperature [24,
Fig. 4.11], [6, Example 5.1]. In the weakly doped n-layer
that makes up the substrate, D’s value in pure silicon is
a good approximation, and this value will be used in the
following.

As shown in Fig. 3, we choose the z-axis so that the
n-layer’s boundaries are located at z = 0 and z = L.
They are modelled as absorbing at z = 0 and re(cid:13)ecting

at z = L, i.e.,

@(cid:26)
@z

@(cid:26)
@z

(cid:26)(z = 0; t) = 0 ;

(z = L; t) = 0 :

(8)

Holes are detected within nanoseconds once they have
reached the depletion zone. The delayed part of the
diode’s output signal is therefore well approximated by
the di(cid:11)usive current of holes out of the n-layer and into
the depletion layer. This current, I(t), is given by Fick’s
law,

I(t) = (cid:0)D

(z = 0; t) :

(9)

The solution to the di(cid:11)usion equation, Eq. (7), in any
compact volume can be written as a discrete sum of eigen-
modes of exponential relaxation, each with its own re-
laxation time. With the boundary conditions of Eq. (8),
Eq. (7) gives

with the higher spatial modes having shorter relaxation
times by factors 9, 25, 49, 81,. . . .

This large separation between the slowest relaxation
mode and the faster ones gives rise to another signi(cid:12)cant
simpli(cid:12)cation. In the case considered in [10], the maxi-
mum frequency considered was as low as 14 kHz. There
all relaxation modes except the slowest one were too fast
to be resolved in time and instead contributed to the part
of the output signal that appeared instantaneous. Also,
silicon is so transparent to the 1064 nm laser light used
that the initial distribution of charge carriers created by
a (cid:13)ash of light was considered constant in the z-direction.
Speci(cid:12)cally, the inverse absorption coe(cid:14)cient of 1064 nm
light in Si is of order 1 mm whereas the dimension of a
typical diode in the z-direction is of order a few hundred
(cid:22)m. These simplifying circumstances made it possible to
use a simple solution of the model.

B. Solution of the di(cid:11)usion equation for a large
range of wavelengths

Here, we discuss a range of wavelengths of incident
laser light and aim to model the experimental power

5

spectrum up to 100 kHz. The density of holes created
by a (cid:13)ash of light then takes the form (cid:26)(z; t = 0) =
(cid:26)0 exp((cid:0)az) where a is the absorption coe(cid:14)cient of sili-
con at the particular wavelength of light. With Eqs. (7{

For a su(cid:14)ciently small absorption coe(cid:14)cient, and with
a Nyquist frequency fNyq = 97.5 kHz as here, several re-
laxation modes may be discerned in the data. Therefore,
we model the response function g(t) of the photodiode
with a yet undetermined number of terms,

g(t) = (cid:11)(diode;N )(cid:14)(t) +

where t is the duration of time from the moment a pulse
of light hits the diode till an output current is detected.
The fraction of response that e(cid:11)ectively is instantaneous
when N relaxation modes are included in the sum, is
denoted (cid:11)(diode;N ). The factor CN is a normalization
factor making the time integral of the second term in g(t)
equal to 1 (cid:0) (cid:11)(diode;N ), i.e., the fraction of the response
that is not e(cid:11)ectively instantaneous. Thus

We see that a pulse of light will, in principle, cause output
at all later times due to the exponentials in Eq. (15), but
we also see that these currents die out exponentially fast,
with characteristic relaxation times given in Eq. (11).

Blocked experimental spectra P (ex)(f ) for various laser wave-
lengths, divided by Phydro(f ). The parameters in Phydro(f )
were determined from a (cid:12)t to the spectra at low frequen-
cies, up to fmax = 2 or 5 kHz. Lines: G(f ) of Eq. (19) with
N = 5. Parameter values were obtained by (cid:12)tting G(f ) to
1064 nm data (with the outlier near 40 kHz excluded. This
noise-peak is caused by some source in the building that
we could not get rid of.). This results in f0 = 9.8(cid:6)0.1 kHz,
L = 0:80 (cid:6) 0:17 mm, and L(dep) = 68 (cid:6) 3 (cid:22)m. The values for
L and L(dep) correspond to (cid:11)(diode) = 0.12 for a wavelength
of (cid:21) = 1064 nm. This (cid:12)t is shown as the solid line through
the 1064 nm data. Other lines use the same values for f0,
L, and L(dep). Upper solid line: (cid:21) = 800 nm, long-dashed:

The theoretical curves plotted in Fig. 4A are G(f ) in
Eq. (19) with parameters L, L(dep) and f0 determined by
(cid:12)tting G(f ) to the data taken with (cid:21)=1064 nm, and using
these values also when comparing G(f ) to data taken at
di(cid:11)erent wavelengths, while varying only the absorption
coe(cid:14)cient a. The curves approximately follow the data.
This demonstrates that our simple physical model goes
a long way in describing what goes on, but also that we
need to re(cid:12)ne it a little in order for it to be useful for
precision calibration.

In the version discussed till now, we have assumed a
sharp boundary between a (cid:12)eld-free n-layer and a (cid:12)eld-
(cid:12)lled depletion-layer. This is not an exact rendition of
reality, but a good approximation as long as one does not
probe the spatial structure of the diode with a resolution
(cid:12)ne enough to resolve the gradual transition between the
n-layer and the depletion zone. When one increases fmax,
higher relaxation modes for the di(cid:11)usion equation are
needed to describe the photo diode’s response function.
The spatial components of these relaxation modes are
eigenfunctions for the Laplacian operator, with a num-
ber of nodes equal to the index n. Thus, as we increase
fmax, and with it our experimental time resolution of the
diode’s response function g(t), we consequently increase
also the resolution with which the experiment probes the
internal spatial geometry of the diode.

This calls for less ideal assumptions than those used
above. We replace the simple one-dimensional di(cid:11)usion
equation Eq. (7) by a di(cid:11)usion equation in three dimen-
sions. We still treat the depletion zone as an absorbing
boundary on the region that we refer to as the n-layer.
We also still treat the n-layer as (cid:12)eld-free, so no convec-
tive term occurs in the di(cid:11)usion equation. Doing this,
and using the fact that the n-layer is a compact volume,
we need not solve the more complicated equation. We
know from mathematical spectral analysis that the solu-

tion for the density of holes can be written

The total number of holes created is

where the functions hn(x; y; z) are unknown spatial
eigenfunctions of the di(cid:11)usion equation in the n-layer.
The values of bn are restricted by normalization, but
apart form this, bn and bn0, as well as (cid:28)n < (cid:28)n0 , are now
treated as unrelated for n < n0. Thus, the response of the
diode retains the structure of Eqs. (15) and (19) with a
discrete spectrum of well-separated relaxation times, but
the speci(cid:12)c expressions in Eqs. (11) and (13) no longer
hold.

the recorded spectrum remains

valid, but the parameters fn and (cid:16)n in it are unknown
a priori, and their values must be chosen by (cid:12)tting
G(f )Phydro(f ) to the experimental spectrum, while
respecting the normalization condition of (cid:16)n. Fig. 4B
demonstrates that with the inclusion of only two
modes in the (cid:12)ltering function, we are able to (cid:12)t the
experimental spectra very well.

V. DIODE PARAMETERS

Below, we (cid:12)t the theoretical model, G(f )Phydro(f ) to
recorded experimental spectra with f0 and (cid:11)(diode) as
(cid:12)tting parameters. These parameters are related to the
dimensions of the diode as follows: From Eq. (12) we
have

f0 =

(cid:25)D
8L2 :

(22)

Since neither the di(cid:11)usion coe(cid:14)cient for holes, D, nor the
depth of the n-layer, L, depends on the laser wavelength,
we expect (cid:12)ts of our model to result in values for f0 that
are independent of the laser wavelength used to obtain
the data (cid:12)tted to. The parameter (cid:11)(diode) denotes the
fraction of light that is detected \instantaneously" ac-
cording to the physical model.

VI. DATA ANALYSIS

Power spectra for recorded positions of the bead were
calculated without use of so-called windowing [25]. In-
stead, noise reduction was achieved by blocking [11, 25,
26], i.e., blockwise averaging. The recorded power spec-
tra were then (cid:12)tted with the model spectra:
In [11],
the recorded experimental spectrum was modelled with
the (cid:12)ltered and aliased physical spectrum. The phys-
ical spectrum is Phydro(f ; R=‘) given in Eq. (5), with
R = 450 nm in our case, and ‘ = 10 (cid:22)m. The data ana-
lyzed in the present paper were recorded with a data ac-
quisition system that uses (cid:1)-(cid:6) technology with 64 times
over-sampling in its ADC [18]. Consequently, there is
no discernible aliasing to account for in the experimen-
tal spectrum, and we didn’t. Filtering by the photodi-
ode detection system we did account for, as described in
Eq. (15). The functional form of any additional electronic
(cid:12)ltering was unknown. So we looked for additional (cid:12)lters
in the electronics in an independent measurement with
a signal generator. We found a (cid:13)at response below 80{
90 kHz (see also Fig. 7A), and we consequently restricted
our analysis of the power spectrum to frequencies below
80 kHz. We assumed no (cid:12)ltering of the physical spec-
trum took place below this frequency, except the para-
sitic one in the photo diode. Combined with the absence
of aliasing, this means that the recorded spectrum can be
compared directly with the physical spectrum after the
latter has been (cid:12)ltered only by the parasitic (cid:12)lter in the
photodiode.

All data series analyzed were consistent with a hookean
force, as assumed in the theory with which we analyze
the data. An example is shown in Fig. 5.

A. De(cid:12)ning a good (cid:12)t

All

spectra were least-square (cid:12)tted with either
Phydro(f ) of Eq. (5) or with G(f )Phydro(f ), with G(f )
given in (19). To judge whether a (cid:12)t was acceptable or
not, the support/goodness-of-(cid:12)t [25, 27] was evaluated.
The goodness-of-(cid:12)t will not reveal small systematic dis-
crepancies between theory and data as long as (cid:31)2 per
degree of freedom is near 1. To be able to detect such er-
rors, we also construct \residual plots" by dividing data
values by (cid:12)tted values, cf. Figs. 2B, 6A, and 7A.

In least-squares (cid:12)tting, each data point enters the ex-
pression for (cid:31)2 with a weight factor that depends on the
error bar on that point. More correctly, the weight factor
depends on the standard deviation of the Gaussian dis-
tribution with respect to which the data points scatter
about the expectation value, the (cid:12)tted function. This
standard deviation is usually estimated by the experi-
mental error bar on the data point. We know its value,
however, hence need not estimate it. The theory that
gives the expectation value, gives the standard devia-
tion as well, with no additional (cid:12)tting parameters in-
troduced [11], but with a small addition to (cid:31)2 so the
quantity minimized is (cid:22)F2 in [11, Eq. (E.7)]. In the fol-
lowing, we accept or do not accept (cid:12)ts depending on their
support and their residual plots, and use the information
from these (cid:12)ts to draw conclusions about the model.

B. Results of (cid:12)ts

8

When (cid:12)tting Phydro(f ) or G(f )Phydro(f ) to experimen-
tal data, we have the option to vary both the maximum
frequency (cid:12)tted to, fmax, and, for G(f )Phydro(f ), also
the number N + 1 of relaxation modes included in the
description of the response function of the diode.

1. Theory without parasitic (cid:12)lter.

As apparent already from Fig. 2B, even for the short-
est wavelengths investigated, no acceptable (cid:12)t of Phydro
was possible with fmax = 80 kHz. Table I summarizes our
results for (cid:12)ts done without accounting for the diode’s
parasitic (cid:12)lter. We see that for frequencies up to at
least 40 kHz, Phydro(f ) describes the recorded spectrum
for wavelengths up to (cid:21) = 900 nm. So in this range the
detection system is not an unintended (cid:12)lter.

TABLE I: Laser wave lengths and power spectrum frequencies
for which the position detection system is not a parasitic (cid:12)lter.
Values for fmax for which (cid:12)ts of Phydro to the experimental
power spectra have at least 1% support. Tested values of fmax
were 2 kHz, 5 kHz, 10 kHz, 15 kHz, 25 kHz, 40 kHz, 60 kHz and
80 kHz.

2. Theory with parasitic (cid:12)lter with only the slowest
di(cid:11)usion mode included.

With only the slowest relaxation mode included in the
description of parasitic (cid:12)ltering by the diode|e.g., with
G(f ) = G0(f ) of Eq. (20)|we obtained (cid:12)ts with a sup-
port of at least 1% for fmax = 80 kHz and for wavelengths
up to (cid:21) = 915 nm. An example is shown in Fig. 6. The
quality of the (cid:12)t is demonstrated both through the sup-
port of 82%, and visually by the residual plot shown in
panel A and the perfect exponential distribution shown
in panel C, cf. [11]. Figure 2 shows the result of an
attempt to (cid:12)t the same data with Phydro alone up to
fmax = 80 kHz.

3. Theory with parasitic (cid:12)lter with all di(cid:11)usion modes,
related by Eqs. (11) and (13).

For wavelengths larger than 915 nm, we investigated
the model assuming an in(cid:12)nitely sharp boundary be-
tween depletion layer and n-layer, i.e., with G(f ) de-
(cid:12)ned through Eqs. (19), (11), and (13). We varied the
value of fmax and the number of modes included in G(f ).
With fmax >20{30 kHz, and for wavelengths larger than
(cid:24)950 nm, no acceptable (cid:12)ts were found. Residual plots
like Fig. 2, showed systematic deviations from the theory.

We consequently dropped the assumption leading to
Eqs. (11) and (13).
Instead, we maintain the discrete
spectrum of relaxation times that is characteristic for
di(cid:11)usion out of any compact region, but treat each re-
laxation time and its relative importance as (cid:12)tting pa-
rameters. As we shall see, physically realistic values re-
sult from (cid:12)tting these parameters. The usefulness of the
model depends on more than its realism: It also depends
on whether the model makes so much more of the power
spectrum meaningful and interpretable that it is worth
the cost of the model’s extra parameters. It does, as we
shall see.

We found that with fmax = 80 kHz, (cid:12)ts with at least
1% support can be obtained for the entire range of laser
wavelengths available, and with the inclusion of only 2
relaxation modes in the description of the diode. Inclu-
sion of more modes did not improve the quality of the
(cid:12)ts which is consistent with f0 (cid:24)10 kHz ! f1 (cid:24)90 kHz
and f2 (cid:24)250 kHz. Each extra mode adds two more pa-
rameters to be (cid:12)tted, fn and (cid:16)n in Eq. (19), and all pa-
rameters were determined only with larger errors for a (cid:12)t
of otherwise similar quality. Therefore, only (cid:12)ts with 2
relaxation modes are considered below. Figure 7 shows
a (cid:12)t to data obtained with the 1064 nm laser. This is
the longest laser wavelength considered here, hence the
case of lowest absorption coe(cid:14)cient in the detector. The
data consequently demonstrate the strongest parasitic (cid:12)l-
tering considered here, and therefore demand the most
from our model for the phenomenon.

From this and similar (cid:12)ts, we determined values for
the parameters that describe the diode. These values are
plotted in Fig. 8. The trends in these data agree with
expectations based on known absorption characteristics
of Si: In Fig. 8AB, the solid curves show (cid:11)(diode) and
(cid:16)0=((cid:16)0 + (cid:16)1) according to Eqs. (10{13). The values used
for L(dep) and L are (cid:12)tted, since their exact values are
proprietary information. A total thickness of the diode of
order 600 (cid:22)m is, to our knowledge, reasonable for typical
diode-dimensions. Panels C and D of the (cid:12)gure show
that at wavelengths where the values of f0 and f1 are well
determined|i.e, where parasitic (cid:12)ltering is signi(cid:12)cant|
their values are roughly independent of the wavelength,

pected for normally distributed data. This may be because
the data acquisition board is slightly non-linear, with rip-
ples in its characteristic function of max (cid:6)0.005 dB ampli-
tude, i.e., (cid:6)1.3 per mil. We have insu(cid:14)cient precision to

FIG. 7: Experimental power spectrum obtained with 1064 nm
laser and (cid:12)tted with P ((cid:12)t)(f ) = G(f )Phydro(f ), using
the phenomenological version of G(f ) in Eq. (19) without
Eqs. (11) and (13), and with just two di(cid:11)usion modes, N = 1.
The value of (cid:31)2 per degree of freedom is 1.023, resulting in
a backing of 10%. The maximum frequency (cid:12)tted to was
fmax = 80 kHz. A: Residual plot. All data are shown, but
only data of frequencies below 80 kHz (straight vertical line)
were (cid:12)tted to. The dots are P (ex)=P ((cid:12)t). Two horizontal lines
show (cid:6)1 standard deviation, known from the theory for the
power spectrum. Note that the data points seem (cid:12)ltered with
a roll-o(cid:11) frequency near 90 kHz. Inset: Same residual plot of
data/(cid:12)t after further block-averaging of data. Two horizon-
tal lines show (cid:6) one standard deviation according to theory,
here (cid:6)2.4 per mil. B: Power spectrum versus frequency in a
log-log plot. Data points with error bars, most of which are
too small to be seen. The solid line is the (cid:12)t. C: Histogram

symbols: one di(cid:11)usional mode in diode-(cid:12)lter. A: The rela-
tive amount (cid:11)(diode) of the position signal that is detected in-
stantly, as function of laser wavelength. The solid line shows a
(cid:12)t of the theory in Eq. (26). It resulted in L(dep) = 128(cid:6)1 (cid:22)m
and L = 458(cid:6)31 (cid:22)m. B: The relative importance of the slow-
est relaxation mode in the parasitic (cid:12)lter, shown as its rela-
tive amplitude (cid:16)0=((cid:16)0 + (cid:16)1). The solid line shows this ratio
for the theory (cid:12)tted as in Panel A. C and D: Frequencies of
the 0th and 1st mode in the diode (cid:12)lter, resulting from (cid:12)ts
at various wavelengths. These values are approximately inde-
pendent of wavelength, as expected. Note the higher value of
f0 for 915 nm, obtained in (cid:12)ts with only one mode included.

VIII. CONCLUSION

When an infrared laser and a common silicon photodi-
ode are used together in a position detection system, the
photodiode is also an unintended low-pass (cid:12)lter. With
1064 nm light, 90% of the signal power is lost at 80 kHz;
with 900 nm light, 10% of the signal power is lost at
80 kHz; see Fig. 4. The physics of this \parasitic (cid:12)l-
tering" phenomenon is understood, and is described by
simple one-dimensional di(cid:11)usion out of a 1D box with
an absorbing boundary. The physical dimensions of the
problem are such that only one or two exponential re-
laxation modes are needed in order to describe the (cid:12)lter
e(cid:11)ect accurately up to 160 kHz sampling frequency; see
Figs. 6 and 7: The 1% stochastic scatter in the experi-
mental power spectral values shown there is too large for
us to resolve any inadequacies in our description of the
parasitic (cid:12)lter’s characteristic function! Thus the (cid:12)lter
characteristics in Eq. (20) with N = 0 or 1 is all it takes
to extend the useful bandwidth of this type of position
detection system, typical for optical tweezers, from as low
as 1 kHz and up to 80 kHz and possibly beyond. The up-
per limit in frequency encountered in the present paper
is not set by our description, but by the electronics used.
A number of alternative photodetectors, of di(cid:11)erent
material or construction, have been applied over the last
couple of years [5, 12] in optical tweezers systems where
infrared lasers are used for position detection. Such de-
tectors provide a large increase in the useful bandwidth,
independent of the procedure of analysis. Interestingly,

11

however, and currently unexplained, signs of parasitic
(cid:12)ltering with a 3dB frequency of order 70 kHz have also
been observed in experiments where 1064 nm light was
detected by an InGaAs diode [29]. The instrumental
(electronic) bandwidth of detection should not be con-
fused with (cid:12)ltering intrinsic to the experiment itself,
which we don’t discuss here. For example, the motions of
a single motor protein molecule attached to an optically
trapped bead, will be low-pass (cid:12)ltered by the mechanical
response of the bead in a viscous solvent [21].

In summary, we have demonstrated here how the elec-
tronic bandwidth of detection for even common silicon
photodetectors used with near IR lasers can be increased
to frequencies approaching 0.1 MHz with high preci-
sion and have provided the tools of analysis necessary to
achieve this. These tools can be easily adapted to sim-
ilar situations commonly encountered in modern optical
trapping experiments.

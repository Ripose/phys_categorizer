construction 

ANKA  [1]  is  a  2.5  GeV  synchrotron  radiation
storage 
the
Forschungszentrum  Karlsruhe  in  Germany.  The
beam  is  accelerated    up  to  0.5  GeV  in  a  booster
synchrotron  and    afterwards  injected  into  ANKA.
In  ANKA  the  beam  is  accumulated  to  200  mA
(second stage: 400 mA) and afterwards accelerated
to  2.5  GeV.  The  injector  system  will  consist  of    a
pre-injector with an end energy of 20 or 50 MeV, a
booster  synchrotron  and  transport  channels.  The
booster  synchrotron  should  be  as  simple  and
inexpensive  as  possible.  In  the  following  three
different  concepts 
the  booster
synchrotron are compared.

for  designing 

1. The selection of the optical code

For  a  compact  and  low  energy  accelerator  the
length of a bending magnet is comparable with the
bending  radius.  In  this  region  the  basic  beam
optical parameters such as emittance and damping
times  are  significantly  influenced  by    edge  effects.
The  beam  parameters  are  calculated  via  the  5
to  I5  [2].  I4,  which
synchrotron  integrals  I1 
describes  the  emittance  and  the  damping  times,
consists  of  two  parts:  the  contribution  from  the
bending  magnets  and  the  contribution  from  the
edge effects [2]

wherein  η  is  the  dispersion,  Φ  is  the  pole  face
angle  in  the  usual  definition  and  ρ  is  the  bending
radius. The sum has to be taken over all pole faces
of the  machine.  For  high  energy  synchrotrons  and
storage  rings  the  contribution  from  the  edges  is
negligible;  hence,  many  programs  like  MAD  [3]
and  BETA  [4]  do  not  take  these  effects  into
account. The codes DIMAD [5] and RACETRACK
[6]  take  the  edge  effects  fully  into  account.  Both

depend  on

the 
depending on  I4  were  calculated  with  the  program
the  momentum
DIMAD.  Beta-functions  and 
compaction factors  were  calculated  either  with  the
program MAD or DIMAD.
In  the  following  three  layouts  of  boosters  are
compared.  Only  booster  synchrotrons  which  are
radiation damped in all 3 directions are considered:
they  can  be  operated  with  power  supplies  of  any
repetition rate, for instance  1 Hz, 3 Hz or 10 Hz.

2.   Optical  comparison of  three different
      designs
 
a.   The  booster  synchrotron  introduced  in  the

ANKA proposal

The optics of the booster synchrotron introduced in
the  ANKA  proposal  [7]  is  shown  in  fig.  1.  The
lattice  consists  of    8  45o  bending  magnets  and  2
quadrupole families.

Fig. 1 βx, βy, η and horizontal phase advance of the
booster  synchrotron  from  the  ANKA  proposal
(MAD  calculations).  The  optical  parameters  are
listed in Table 1.

b. Weak focusing booster synchrotron

An  example  of  a  simple  weak  focusing  booster
synchrotron  is  shown  in  fig.  2.  It  consists  only  of
four  90  degree  sector  bending  magnets  with  a
gradient.  The    parameters  for  a  zero  pole  face

angle are listed in table 1. Using  a pole face angle
≠0 can improve emiitance and  α significantly.

given by the injection process.

3.  Longitudinal acceptance

The  longitudinal  acceptance  of  the  booster  at
injection and during ramping is mainly determined
by the energy of the beam, the RF voltage and α.

a.   RF system
The synchrotron radiation loss at maximum energy
will  be  around  4  keV/turn,  40  W  for  a  10  mA
beam. Assuming a pillbox type cavity with a shunt
impedance  of  3  MΩ  and  an  overvoltage  factor  of
around  7  the  power  dissipated  on  the  wall  of  the
cavity will not exceed 120 W.
The  simplest  solution  for  the  ANKA-booster  RF
system is a 200 W solid state amplifier  (as in SRS

focusing  synchrotron
consisting  of  only  4  bending  magnets  with  a
gradient (MAD calculations)

c.   Strong  focusing  booster  synchrotron  with  a

gradient in the bending magnets

An  example  of  a  strong 
focusing  booster
synchrotron    with  900  bends  with  gradients  and  1
quadrupole family is shown in fig. 3.

gradient (MAD calculation)

d.   Table of the optical  parameters

The  optical  parameters  of  the  three  machines  are
in  Table  1.  The  most  significant
compared 
differences  between  the  three  machines  are  in  the
emittances and the momentum compaction factors.

e. The evolution of the emittance

With the parameters listed in table 1 the evolution
of  the  emittances  during  acceleration  is  shown  in
fig. 4. In the given example the acceleration time is

booster  [8]  ).  With  this  amplifier  the  peak  RF
voltage  is  25  kV.  The  voltage  is  constant  during
acceleration. Only a low level  control loop for the
phase  for  synchronizing  the  booster  with  the  pre-
injector and the storage ring exists.

b. Longitudinal acceptance
Figure 5 shows the separatrix for the three boosters
at  20 MeV.  The  maximum  gives  the  longitudinal
energy  acceptance:  0.85%  for  the  proposal,  0.5 %
for  the  weak  focusing  (WF)  and  1.0  %  for  the
strong focusing (SF). The differences come mainly
from  the  different  momentum  compactions  of  the
boosters.

MeV with an RF peak voltage of  25 kV

The capture efficiency also depends on the time
structure  of  the  beam.  With  a  bunch  distance  of
0.33 ns  only  about  4  out  of  6  bunches  will  be
accepted  by  the  RF  bucket  in  the  booster.  With  a
500  Mhz  pre-buncher  at  the  exit  of  the  gun  each
bunch finds a corresponding bucket.

Figure  6  shows  the  typical  evolution  of  the
beam envelope during ramping. Once the electrons
are  captured  there  will  be  no  losses  during  the
acceleration  due  to  longitudinal  oscillations  since
the emittance is faster reduced than the acceptance.

 The  quantum  lifetime  depends  on  the  momentum
compaction  factor:  the  larger  α,  the  shorter  the
quantum  lifetime.  Assuming  again  a  200  W
amplifier  the  quantum  lifetime  for  the  proposal
booster and the SF is around 5  min,  for  the  WF  it
is  only  300  ms.  With  an  acceleration  time  of  0.1

sec  the  WF  booster    will  have  an  additional  beam
loss of  35% due to the quantum excitations.
4. Pre-Accelerator

The  pre-injector  can  be  either  a  linac  or  a
microtron.  Both  can  be  equipped  with  a  500  MHz
prebuncher.  Table  2  compares 
the  different
possibilities  under  the  assumption  that  the  current
is 10 mA at 500 MeV. In these calculations  a  loss
of    75%  is  assumed  due  to  transversal  oscillations
during injection and acceleration.

The  two    types  of  boosters  require    different
injection  and  ejection  schemes.    Fig.  7  shows  the
closed  orbit  distortion  in  the  case  that  only  one
kicker  for  the  WF  and  the  SF  booster  is  used  for
injection. The weak focusing booster needs a large
aperture.

(dotted  line)  and  a  SF  (solid  line)  booster.    In  the
case of the WF booster two kickers are needed.

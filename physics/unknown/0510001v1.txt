Abstract:  Specially  designed  metal-dielectric  composites  can  have  a  negative  refractive 

index  in  the  optical  range.  Specifically,  it  is  shown  that  arrays  of  single  and  paired 

nanorods  can  provide  such  negative  refraction.  For  pairs  of  metal  rods,  a  negative 

refractive  index  has  been  observed  at  1.5  µm.  The  inverted  structure  of  paired  voids  in 

metal  films  may  also  exhibit  a  negative  refractive  index.  A  similar  effect  can  be 

accomplished with metal strips in which the refractive index can reach −2. The refractive 

index retrieval procedure and the critical role of light phases in determining the refractive 

index is discussed.

Introduction 

In  the  recent  few  years,  there  has  been  a  strong  interest  in  novel  optical  media  which  have 

become  known  as  left-handed  materials  (LHMs)  or  negative  index  materials  (NIMs).  Such 

materials  have  not  been  discovered  as  natural  substances  or  crystals,  but  rather  are  artificial, 

man-made  materials.  The  optical  properties  of  such  media  were  considered  in  early  papers  by 

two Russian physicists, Mandel’shtam1 and Veselago,2 although much earlier works on negative 

phase  velocity  and  its  consequences  belong  to  Lamb3  (in  hydrodynamics)  and  Schuster4  (in 

optics).

  form  a  left-handed  set  of  vectors,  and  were  therefore  named 

LHMs by Veselago. As a result of the negative index of refraction and negative phase velocity, 

these artificial materials exhibit a number of extraordinary features, including an inverse Snell’s 

law  relationship,  a  reversed  Doppler  shift,  and  reversed  Cherenkov  radiation.  These  features 

suggest a flexible regulation of light propagation in these media and facilitate new, fascinating 

applications.  

The most recent successful efforts to demonstrate negative refraction have been inspired 

by Pendry’s revision5 of the Veselago lens, which renewed interest in the practical aspects of the 

earlier  papers.  Pendry  predicted  that  a  NIM  lens  can  act  as  a  “superlens”  by  providing  spatial 

resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Fig. 1 compares the simplest case of refraction at a single 

interface  between  vacuum  and  common,  positive  refractive  index  material  (Fig.  1(a))  versus 

refraction  at  the  interface  with  a  NIM  (Fig.  1(b)).  For  any  oblique  angle  of  incidence 

iθ ,  the 

(cid:71)
tangential  wavevector  k(cid:38)

  of  an  incident  plane  wave  from  the  vacuum  side  must  remain 

continuous across the interface. This is the case for both positive and negative refractive indicies. 

However,  in  contrast  to  a  normal,  positive  refraction  material  as  the  light  passes  from  vacuum 

 

2

(cid:71)
into a NIM, the wavevector component normal to the interface (k⊥

) must change the sign. As a 

result,  the  total  refracted  wavevector  is  on  the  same  side  of  the  normal  as  the  incident 

wavevector.  Figure  1(b)  illustrates  this  effect  as  the  reversed  Snell’s  law,  where  the  angles  of 

θ
reflection ( rθ ) and transmission ( tθ ) are reversed ( r

t

θ= ) for the case of n = −1. This reversal 

suggests  insightful  consequences  for  the  imaging  applications  of  NIMs,  the  most  critical  of 

which  is  the  ‘perfect  lens’  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  1(c).  For  refracted  rays  from  a  point  source,  a 

planar NIM slab of sufficient thickness with n = −1 should first focus the rays inside the NIM 

and  then  re-focus  them  again  behind  the  slab.  At  the  perfect  lensing  condition  of  n  =  −1,  this 

focusing property is extraordinary, and the resolution limit intrinsic to conventional imaging no 

longer applies to imaging with a NIM slab as shown by Pendry.5 The essence of the effect is that 

a  NIM  compensates  the  usual  decay  of  the  evanescent  waves.  Contrary  to  a  conventional 

imaging device, in a super lens these evanescent waves are recovered by the NIM and the image 

is  perfectly  reconstructed.5  The  perfect  lensing  requirements  (

difficult conditions to meet. The first requirement means that n is wavelength-dependent and the 

perfect  lens  is  restricted  to  work  at  a  single  wavelength.  The  second  requirement  implies  that 

there  is  no  absorption  in  the  NIM.  In  reality,  losses  are  always  present  in  the  NIM  and  can 

dramatically diminish the resolution.6,7 

The  development  of  optical  NIMs  is  closely  connected  to  studies  of  periodic  arrays  of 

elementary  scatterers,  where,  for  example,  frequency  selective  surfaces  (FSS)  arranged  from 

those arrays have been used as narrowband filters for plane waves. The major resonant elements 

of  optical  metal-dielectric  composites  (metallic  spheres,  disks,  rods,  and  their  inversions,  i.e. 

circular and elliptic holes) have been inherited from earlier FSS designs, together with evident 

orthotropic properties and angular dependences. Another source of earlier expertise is found in 

 

3

the studies of artificial dielectrics (ADs), where the homogenization method and approaches to 

define  equivalent  electromagnetic  material  properties  have  been  examined  under  resonant 

conditions.  Predictions  of  anomalously  large  effective  permeability  and  permittivity  due  to 

resonant regimes of elementary scatterers have also been made for ADs arranged from periodic 

metal-dielectric structures8.

While  negative  permittivity  in  the  optical  range  is  easy  to  attain  for  metals,  there  is  no 

magnetic  response  for  naturally-occurring  materials  at  such  high  frequencies.  Recent  theories 

and  experiments  showed  that  a  magnetic  response  and  negative  permeability  can  be 

accomplished in the terahertz spectral ranges by using parallel rods, split-ring resonators (SRRs) 

and  other  structures.9-14  As  predicted13  and  experimentally  demonstrated,14  u-shaped  structures 

are  particularly  well  suited  for  magnetism  at  optical  frequencies.  Recently,  light  propagation 

through  an  interface  that  mimics  negative  refraction  has  also  been  found  in  two-dimensional 

photonic  crystals  (PCs).15  It  has  been  shown  that  under  certain  conditions,  unique  focusing 

effects in PCs are also possible.16

Up  to  the  microwave  frequencies  the  fabrication  of  metal-dielectric  composites  can 

follow practically any pattern suggested either by human intuition or computer-aided tools with 

evolutionary optimization. Yet at optical frequencies, the best possible design of metal-dielectric 

composite  NIM  should  overcome  two  substantial  difficulties:  severe  fabrication  constrains  and 

increased losses. For these reasons, this paper addresses the simplest geometries of resonant 3D 

structures.  Such  structures  include  coupled  metal  rods  in  a  dielectric  host17-21  (fabricated,  for 

example,  through  electron-beam  lithography  (EBL))  and  inversions  of  rods,  i.e.  coupled 

dielectric holes of elliptical (spherical,22 in the limiting case) or rectangular shape23 (fabricated, 

for  example,  by  etching  tri-layer  metal-dielectric-metal  films  by  ion  beam  etching  (IBE)  or 

through interferometric lithography).  

The  first  experimental  realization  of  a  negative  refractive  index  in  the  optical  range  (at 

1.5 µm) was accomplished with paired metal nanorods in a dielectric,21 and then for the inverted 

system  of  paired  dielectric  voids  in  a  metal.22,23  We  note  that  inverted  NIMs,  i.e.  elliptical  or 

rectangular dielectric voids in metal films,23 are physically equivalent to paired metal rods in a 

dielectric  host,  in  accordance  with  the  Babinet  principle.24  We  also  note  here  Ref.  [25]  that 

considers  other  interesting  optical  properties  of  metal  rods,  although  these  properties  are  not 

related directly to NIMs.  

In the current paper, in addition to paired metal rods and dielectric voids, we also study 

two-dimensional coupled-strip composites as a basis for further comprehensive studies of NIMs.

Homogenized optical parameters of NIMs 

Equivalent multilayer structure at normal incidence 

Our  NIM  designs  are  confined  in  a  thin  layer  placed  on  a  thick  substrate;  therefore,  a  direct 

measurement  can  not  resolve  the  reversed  refraction  due  to  insufficient  optical  length. 

Fortunately,  accurate  indirect  measurements  work  very  well  to  retrieve  the  effective  optical 

constants of the NIM. 

First, we ascribe an effective refractive index to a layer of the NIM as if it were a layer of 

homogeneous  medium.  This  assumption  suggests  that  the  periodic  structure  of  NIM  does  not 

diffract  the  incident  plane  wave.  Then  we  consider  a  straightforward  direct  problem  of  plane 

wave propagation through a multilayer structure of homogeneous materials at normal incidence, 

as  shown  in  Fig.  2.  The  electric  field  at  the  initial  interface  on  the  source  side  (

Restoration of the refractive index

applied  for  the  both  expressions.26  Since  the  material  of  the  ν -th  layer  is  passive,  we  choose

Since  n′   has  multiple  branches,  to  avoid  ambiguities  in  selecting  a  phase-adjusting 

integer  l  in Eq. (12) one should start the restoration of  nν′  from a higher wavelength (far away 

from  resonances)  and  obtain  physically  sound  values  of  nν′ .  Then,  the  wavelength  should  be 

moved toward shorter values while simultaneously adjusting the values of l  in Eq. (12) to obtain

zH  between the strips calculated using the finite element method (FEM) for two samples with 

different gold thickness (13 nm and 19 nm). All other dimensions in both case are identical (h = 

480 nm,w = 450 nm, and 

1∆ = 160 nm). The values of 

zH  in both field maps of Fig. 4(b) are

normalized by the instantaneous magnitude of the incident field, which is adjusted to arrive at a 

positive maximum half way between the strips. The magnetic field in both cases is calculated at 

a minimal refractive index (i.e., at λ ≈ 850 nm for  δ = 13 nm and λ ≈ 900 nm for  δ = 19 nm) and 

is  normalized  using  the  maximal  incident  field.  Figs.  4(c)  and  (d)  depict  the  reflectance  R ,

dramatically on thickness  δ . Notice how a six nm increase in thickness (about 30 %) weakens 

the  effective  diamagnetic  properties  of  the  structure  (Fig.  4(b))  and  cancels  the  negative 

refraction effect in Fig. 4(d), simultaneously shifting the resonances of  A  and  R  toward shorter 

wavelengths  in  Fig.  4(c).  The  quantitative  changes  in  absorbed  and  reflected  energy  are  to  be 

expected, and an analysis in terms of reflectivity and transmission is sometimes used to restore 

the  refractive  index22.  Unfortunately  these  quantitative  differences  can  be  easily  distorted  by 

experiment-simulation  mismatches  and  measurement  errors.  The  use  of  only  the  magnitude 

changes of reflectivity and transmission complicates the examination of the resonant behavior of 

n , which for the most part follows phase changes in the transmitted and reflected light. Fig. 4 

clearly  shows  that  structures  with  very  similar  magnitudes  of  reflectance  (transmittance)  may 

have dramatically different refractive indices, which emphases the role of phase measurements in 

finding the refraction. 

To show just how indicative the phase changes can be to the negative refraction behavior 

we consider the following two phase-based approximations for n′ ,

according to Eqs. (17) and (18), the refractive index is fully determined by phases only, in the 

corresponding limiting cases. 

To provide a test example for Eqs. (17) and (18), we approximate the values of refractive 

index  obtained  from  FEM  simulations  of  the  2D  structure  of  Fig.  4(a).  Fig.  5  depicts  the 

refractive index of periodic paired strips retrieved from the exact retrieval formula of Eq. (7) and 

independently  obtained  from  the  approximate  formulas  of  Eqs.  (17)  and  (18)  for  six  different 

geometries.  First,  note  that  the  negative  refractive  index  can  reach  large  magnitudes  for  such 

structures close to -2 (see Fig. 5e and 5f). Common parameters for all cases are the period (h = 

480 nm), and the total layer thickness ( ∆ = 140 nm). The strips in (a), (c), and (e) are 440 nm 

wide and 16, 15, and 14 nm thick, respectively. The 450 nm strips in (b), (d), and (f) are 17, 16, 

and 15 nm thick, respectively. To simulate the complex permittivity of gold in FEM models, the 

Drude  model  is  used  with  parameters  selected  to  match  the  experimental  optical  constants  of 

bulk gold. Each simulation begins from a wavelength of 2.5 µm (not shown) and then continues 

toward shorter values with a gradual step size variation from 50 to 1 nm at steep segments. The 

cases  of  Fig.  5  are  specifically  selected  to  represent  the  main  possible  scenarios,  i.e.  positive 

refraction,  shown  in  (a)  and  (b);  negative  refraction,  shown  in  (e)  and  (f);  or  a  transition  to 

n′ < , shown in (c) and (d).

Fig. 5. The refractive index of periodic paired 
strips  obtained  for  two  different  geometries 
from FEM simulations and approximations at 
the same wavelength range. Strips in (a), (c), 
and  (e)  are  440  nm  wide,  while  those  in  (b), 
(d),  and  (f)  are  450  nm  wide.  Approximating 
function (cid:92) is given by Eq. (18). 

Notice that Eqs. (17) and (18) do not include any magnitudes and suggest an instrumental 

role for phase differences 

τ =

 and 

ρ =

 in representing NIM features. Indeed, in all 

cases both approximations illustrate well the changes of  n′ . Certainly, the approximate formula 

 

15

of Eq. (18) works better than the simpler formula of Eq. (17). This is because the reflection is 

quite large at short waves, and it is increasing toward longer wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 4(c). 

High-precision phase measurements of thin NIMs 

We  performed  phase  measurements  using  polarization  and  walk-off  interferometry  schemes 

depicted in Fig. 6 for transmitted light phases ( τ ). The phase differences  in  reflection ( ρ ) are 

measured  in  a  similar  manner.  In  both  schematic  diagrams  LC  is  a  liquid  crystal  phase 

compensator,  PD  is  a  photo-detector,  and  P  is  a  linear  polarizer  (the  axes  of  the  input/output 

polarizers are parallel at 45°). 

In  the  polarization  interferometer  shown  in  Fig.  6(a),  the  two  optical  channels  have  a 

common  geometrical  path  and  differ  only  by  the  polarization  of  light.  The  phase  differences 

caused  by  anisotropy  of  a  refractive  material  in  transmission 

τ∆   (or  reflection 

ρ∆ )  are 

measured between orthogonally-polarized waves 

∆ = −(cid:38)

τ

τ

τ⊥

 (or  ρ

∆ = −(cid:38)

ρ

). Notice that 

the phase acquired in the substrate contributes nothing to either τ∆  or  ρ∆ . 

 

The walk-off interferometer, shown in Fig. 6(b), has two optical channels which differ in 

geometrical path; this yields a phase shift introduced by a NIM sample in transmission ( sτ ) or 

reflection  ( sρ )  relative  to  a  reference  ( airτ   or 

airρ )  so  that

layer of air with the same thickness as the NIM layer is used as the reference. Both the reference 

and sample beams go through the substrate so that the phase acquired in the substrate does not 

contribute to the measured phase shift  δτ  and  δρ , provided that the substrate has no deviations 

in optical thickness. The walk-off effect in anisotropic crystals (ACs) is employed to separate the 

two beams and then bring them together to produce interference. The phase shifts  δτ(cid:38)  ( δρ(cid:38) ) and 

δτ⊥   ( δρ⊥ )  are  measured  for  two  light  polarizations  using  a  set  of  diode  lasers  and  a  tunable

The 

instrumental  error  of 

the  phase  anisotropy  measurement  by  polarization 

interferometer is ±1.7º. We note that variations in the substrate thickness do not affect the results 

of our phase anisotropy measurements, which is typical for common path interferometers. In the 

case  of  the  walk-off  interferometer,  the  thickness  variation  gives  an  additional  source  of  error, 

causing the error for the absolute phase shift measurements to increase up to ±4º.  

We  note  here  two  important  details  of  the  measurements.  First,  by  varying  the  lateral 

position of the sample relative to the optical beam, the phase shift is smoothly changed from zero 

when the beam is outside the sample (position 1 in Fig. 6(c)), to the measured value when the 

beam  is  at  the  sample  center  (position  3).  The  introduction  of  intermediate  points,  such  as 

position  2,  eliminates  the  2π  uncertainty  in  measurement.  Secondly,  the  linear  polarization  of 

light is well preserved after propagation through the sample for both light polarizations (parallel 

and  perpendicular  to  the  rods).  Specifically,  the  light  ellipticity  (the  intensity  ratio  for  the  two 

components)  changes  only  from  10-3  to  3×10-3  after  propagation  through  the  sample.  Thus  we 

can conclude that the method used provides direct measurements of the magnitude and sign of 

the phase shift for the two linearly polarized components of light. 

As shown in Eq. (17), in the case of low reflection and small thickness, Eq. (7) confines 

the  phase  difference  to

absorption, the relation between complex parameters  t ,  r  and  n  is even more complicated and 

phase  measurements  should  be  accompanied  by  measurements  of  the  transmittance  and 

reflectance magnitudes in order to use the accurate procedure of Eqs. (11), (12) and (13).  

To validate the procedure for the restoration of  n′  and the phase-based approximations 

(Eqs.  (17)  and  (18)),  we  use  experimental  data  of  our  3D  NIM  sample21  (see  below  for  more 

detailed consideration of this Sample B, consisting of pairs of coupled nanorods). The sample is 

arranged of a periodic array of coupled gold nanorods deposited directly on glass. Fig. 7 shows 

the  refractive  index  obtained  (a)  from  FDTD  simulations,  and  (b)  from  measurements.  A 

segment  of  the  wavelength  range  where  the  refractive  index  becomes  minimal  is  selected.  The 

minimal value of  n′ for this structure is about −0.3 at 1.5 µm. In contrast to the examples of Fig. 

5, in this case approximations by Eq. (17) work better due to lower reflection.

Numerical and physical experiments with NIMs 

Up to now, we have seen that a negative refractive index is provided by resonant coupled metal-

dielectric elementary scatterers. For example, our typical 2D models of Fig. 4(a) display negative 

refraction up to n = −2, as shown in Fig. 4(d) and Figs. 5(e) and (f). These strip structures can be 

readily fabricated, but losses are still rather large. 

 

We now analyze the NIM-substrate interaction, beginning with the basic cases of a single 

gold  rod  on  ITO-glass  and  pure  glass  substrates.  We  then  consider  several  core  3D  NIMs  that 

demonstrate a negative refractive index proven in both experiments and simulations.21-23 

An equivalent Debye model in FDTD 

Rather  than  utilizing  the  previously  applied  finite  element  method  (FEM)  to  investigate  the 

resonance behavior of 2D gold strips and to pinpoint a negative refractive index as an effective 

quantity,  the  numerical  method  we  use  for  3D  structures  involves  the  well  known  finite-

difference  time  domain  (FDTD)  technique.27  The  FDTD  modeling  of  plasmonic  resonances  in 

the  optical  range  is  more  complicated  than  either  a  standard  perfect  electric  conductor  (PEC) 

approach for thin skin-depths or a direct application of conductivity. 

The  Drude  model  for  a  given  single  decay  constant  ( Γ )  and  plasma  frequency  (

pω )  is

Upon  obtaining  the  result,  we  suggest  that  for  the  transverse  magnetic  case,  where  the  electric 

field is parallel to the periodic rods, we observe a coupled resonant behavior because, as shown 

below, the electric field is able to circulate in continuous contours at the rod-substrate interface. 

We also imply that strong coupling with a lossy substrate such as ITO could be unfavorable. For 

this reason, a novel double-periodic structure has been fabricated, tested and simulated using 3D

(called Sample A) is shown in Fig. 8(b), and a top view of the unit cell is shown in Fig. 8(d). The 

double-periodic  structure  consists  of  two  rods  which  share  the  dimensions  of  the  single  rod  in 

Fig.  8(a)  and  (c).  We  note  that,  in  spite  of  more  sophisticated  periodicity,  the  double-periodic 

metallic  elements  exhibit  very  similar  refractive  index  behavior  and  absorbance  in  both 

polarization directions. An example for the parallel polarization is shown in Figs. 10(a) and (c). 

That also suggests that deviations (up to 20%) in periodicity do not change the equivalent optical 

properties  of  the  periodic  plasmonic  structure.  We  note  that  in  spite  of  the  non-idealities  of 

Sample  A,  shown  in  Fig.  8(a),  the  phase  anisotropy  in  Fig.  10(b)  and  the  transmittance  (T) 

normalized by the transmittance of the substrate (Ts) in Fig. 10(d) both satisfactorily match the 

experimental data. 

As illustrated below, the rods are also coupled inductively to the ITO-glass substrate. The 

electric field component 

zE , which is not mixed with the incident field, is mapped at xy cross-

sections  taken  through  the  middle  of  the  rod  (see  Fig.  11(a))  and  just  10  nm  beyond  the  rod 

inside the ITO (Fig. 11(b)). The rods are shown by dashed lines in Fig. 11. In both cases the two 

rods perform almost like a strip, forming a high-order evanescent mode inside ITO. In addition 

to xy cross-sectional field maps, Fig. 11 depicts the values of the electric field component 

zE  in

depict  field  maps  for  non-coupled  rods  on

in  (e)

any substrate. In (a) and (e) the electric field

through  the  middle  of  the  rod.  All  magnetic 
field  values  are  normalized  by  the  magnetic 
incident field taken at the geometrical center 
of the rod. 

center of the rod. 

The  conductivity  of  ITO  is  large  enough  to  allow  for  electric  fields  to  circulate  along 

continuous contours through the gold-ITO interface. After the incident magnetic field is added to 

 

26

the induced one, reversed magnetic field zones are observed right at the gold-ITO interface (see 

Fig. 11(d)). 

Using FDTD analysis of non-coupled rods of Fig. 8(d), it was discovered that a simple 

substitution of the ITO-glass substrate with bare glass could provide a negative refractive index. 

Fig. 10(e) depicts FDTD results for the non-coupled rods of Fig. 8(d) but without any substrate. 

The  minimal  value  of 

n′ ≈ −   is  achieved  at  a  wavelength  of  0.9  µm.  The  results  are 

0.2

consistent with the more intense and larger field reversal zone shown in Fig. 11(h). We note a 

substantially different distribution of the electric component

zE  in this case. This observation of 

negative  refractive  index  for  single,  non-coupled  rods  is  in  agreement  with  earlier  theoretical 

predictions.18

field  reversal  similar  to  that  above  would  be  desirable.  Such  a  NIM  would  consist  of  periodic 

arrays of coupled gold rods oriented parallel to the incident electric field and deposited directly 

on glass. An example unit cell is depicted in Fig. 12(a) and (c) and the results for the refractive 

index and transmittance, reflectance, and absorbance are shown in Figs. 13(a) and (b). The model 

demonstrates  a  refractive  index  of  about  −0.5  at  1360  µm,  although  with  substantial  losses 

around this point.  

To  avoid  a  probable  interaction  between  the  rows  of  coupled  rods,  and  to  possibly 

decrease  losses,  an  alternative  sample  (Sample  B)  with  a  skewed  symmetry  as  shown  in  Fig. 

12(b)  and  (d)  has  been  manufactured  and  simulated.  Sample  B  requires  a  unit  cell  four  times 

larger than that considered  for  the  structure of Fig, 12(a) and (c), and consequently one would 

expect a weaker negative refraction effect due to a smaller metal filling factor. Indeed, as shown 

in Fig. 14(a), the index of refraction obtained from FDTD simulations for parallel polarization is 

– 0.2 at 1.5 µm with the geometry of Fig. 12(b) and (d). Experimental studies of the NIM provide

properties, we have fabricated a preliminary sample on an ITO-glass substrate with a geometry 

very close to that of Sample B and compared it to the results from Sample B. 

First,  in  contrast  to  Sample  B,  the  preliminary  sample  does  not  demonstrate  a  negative 

refractive index in either experiment or simulations. Second, the induced electric mode between 

the rods appears to be too high, and the magnitude of the induced magnetic dipole moment is too 

low  for  a  good  magnetic  reaction  in  this  case.  That  effect  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  15.  The  figure 

shows  simulated  maps  of  the  electric  field 

zE   obtained  for  the  two  samples  with  similar 

geometries.  Field  maps  in  Fig.  15(a)  and  (b)  represent  the  sample  deposited  on  an  ITO-glass 

substrate, while the maps in Fig. 15(c) and (d) are calculated for the same geometry deposited on 

Fig.  15.  Simulated  maps  of  Ez obtained  for

ITO-glass  substrate,  while  (c)  and  (d)  are 
calculated for a similar sample deposited on 
bare  glass  (Sample  B).  Electric  field  (Ez)  is 
mapped  at  two  xy  cross-sections:  through 
the  middle  of  the  pair  of  rods,  as  in  (a)  and 
(c),  or  just  10  nm  beyond  the  rod  inside  ITO 
or glass, as in (b) and (d).

bare glass (Sample B). 

zE  is taken at two xy cross-sections, first through the middle of the rod, 

as shown in (a) and (c), and then at 10 nm beyond the rod inside the substrate, as depicted in (b) 

and  (d).  Comparison  of  (a)  to  (c)  allows  us  to  conclude  that  the  elimination  of  ITO  produces 

stronger currents in the required mode between the rods. Weaker higher-order current modes are 

generated between the rods in the sample with an ITO-glass substrate, as shown in Fig. 15(a). 

In  addition,  both  samples  are  not  optimized  for  the  best  magnetic  reaction,  since  the 

second  rod  in  both  cases  does  not  “channel”  a  sufficient  part  of  the  electric  field.  Indeed,  we 

have  assumed  that 

zE   should  be  at  least  weaker  (or  reversed)  just  beyond  the  second  rod. 

Unfortunately in both samples, as indicated in Fig. 15(b) and (d), 

zE  neither decays nor changes 

its  direction  at  the  cross-section  just  behind  the  rods.  In  essence,  the  presence  of  any  substrate 

alters the symmetry of the interacting rods and restrains the magnetic reaction between the rod 

pair. This defect could be alleviated by optimizing the design of the structure. 

Inverted nanorods: coupled elliptic voids in metallic films 

To achieve a NIM within a given range of optical wavelengths, an inverted structure could also 

be  employed  along  with  dielectric  spacers  between  coupled  metallic  elements.  Such  a  design 

offers a good manufacturability for a thick multilayer NIM.  

An  FDTD  model  is  created  to  match  the  experimental  sample  of  Ref.  [23];  the 

dimensions  used  in  simulations  are  rounded  (shown  in  parentheses).  The  basis  of  the  structure 

consists  of  a  three-layer  film  composite  deposited  over  a  BK7  glass  substrate.  The  composite 

consists of two 30 (30) nm layers of gold separated by a 75 (80) nm layer of Al2O3 as shown in 

Fig. 16(a). An array of elliptical wells (voids) is then etched out of the three layer composite to 

give the final sample with a 2D lattice period of 787 (790) nm. The dimensions of the elementary

Fig. 17(b) and (d)). The other approximation, Eq. (18), provides a better fit in all cases. 

The  inverted  NIM  demonstrates  a  negative  refractive  index  of  −1.5  at  1.8  µm  for 

perpendicular polarization (electric field is along the short axis of the elliptic well) and −0.75 at 

1.6 µm for parallel polarization (electric field is along the long axis of the elliptic well), which is 

consistent  with  the  experimental  data23.  As  expected  for  inverted  structures,  the  perpendicular 

polarization works better than the parallel one.

Summary 

We  have  described  and  discussed  several  thin  composite  metal-dielectric  structures  which 

demonstrate an effective negative refractive index. We considered examples of how the complex 

values of the transmission and reflection coefficients (t and  r ) taken either from measurements 

or  simulations  could  be  used  to  obtain  the  index  of  refraction.  From  t   and  r   for  the  incident 

plane  wave,  we  calculated  the  effective  refractive  index  for  all  of  the  composite  materials 

 

34

considered herein. The description is based on an effective layer of homogeneous media with the 

same effect on  t  and  r  as a given layer of a NIM of the same thickness. Characteristic matrices 

are  used  to  obtain  the  effective  impedance  and  the  effective  refractive  index  for  a  single 

unknown NIM layer in an arbitrary multilayer structure. 

Our  simulations  show  that  a  composite  NIM  based  on  a  2D  periodic  array  of  coupled 

gold  strips  separated  by  a  continuous  dielectric  layer  can  have  a  negative  refractive  index  of 

We also showed the critical importance of phases for retrieval of the refractive index. We 

have found that formulas using only the phases of  t  and  r  could represent a good alternative to 

exact restoration of the refractive index. Consequently, we propose two interferometry schemes, 

the  polarization  interferometer  for  measuring  phase  anisotropy  between  two  different 

polarizations in transmission (reflection), and the walk-off interferometer for measuring absolute 

We found that non-coupled gold rods arranged on an ITO-glass substrate do not provide a 

negative refractive index because of the damping associated with the conductive features of ITO. 

We deduce that losses in ITO introduce a barrier to achieving negative refraction with ITO-glass 

substrates.  Simulations  indicate  that  an  identical  structure  on  a  glass  substrate  could  give

phases. 

n′ ≈ − .

Experimental  studies  for  a  sample  based  on  an  array  of  paired  metal  rods  on  a  glass 

substrate allowed us to observe a negative refractive index of −0.3 at 1.5 µm, in good agreement 

with our simulations. 

Finally,  we  showed  that  inverse  structures  also  provide  good  results  in  creating  NIMs. 

We  analyzed  an  inversion  of  the  coupled  rods  structure,  where  the  coupled  gold  rods  are 

 

35

substituted  by  coupled  voids  in  gold  films.  Validating  the  design  suggested  in  Ref.  [23],  we 

obtained  a  refractive  index  of  −1.5  at  1.8  µm  for  perpendicular  polarization  (the  electric  field 

along  the  short  axis  of  the  elliptic  well)  and  −0.75  at  1.6  µm  for  parallel  polarization.  Again 

using our suggested phase-based approximations, we found that, similar to non-inverted designs, 

only the phases of  t  and  r  are sufficient to provide estimates of the negative refraction effect in 

inverted designs with voids. 

We  expect  that  further  optimization  of  design  techniques  for  composite  NIMs  will 

provide  a  stronger  effect  at  smaller  losses,  enabling  new  devices  based  on  scalable  3D  NIM

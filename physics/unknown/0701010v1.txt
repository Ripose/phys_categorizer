Abstract:  Spectra comprised of hundreds of time-components for absorption path lengths up 
to  130  km  have  been  recorded  around  1050  nm  by  combining  two  recent  techniques, 
intracavity laser spectroscopy with vertical external cavity surface emitting multiple-quantum-
well lasers and time-resolved Fourier transform spectroscopy. A sensitivity of 1 10-10 cm-1.Hz-
1/2 is achieved, for simultaneously acquired 104 spectral elements, three orders of magnitude 
better than the sensitivity obtained in previous similar experiments. Specific advantages of the 
method, especially for frequency and intensity metrology of weak absorption transitions, are 
discussed.

IntraCavity Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (ICLAS) is recognized as one of the most 
sensitive  detection  techniques  for  absorption.1  Since  its  introduction  in  the  seventies,  the 
method  has  taken  advantage  of  various  laser  gain  media  and  has  been  applied  in  many 
spectroscopic  studies,  mostly  in  the  visible  spectral  range.  A  comprehensive  review  of  the 
principles and applications of the method is provided in Ref 2. To summarize, the absorbing 
sample  is  located  inside  a  laser  cavity,  whose  gain  medium  is  broader  than  the  absorber 
linewidth.  From  the  beginning  of  a  laser  pulse  until  the  observation  time  tg  (also  called 
generation time), the absorption follows the Lambert-Beer law with path length L= c tg, where 
c  is  the  velocity  of  light.  Sensitivities  of  the  order  of  10-9  cm-1  are  now  routinely  reported. 
Although it is a rather complicated system involving the dynamical evolution of laser modes, 
a  major  advantage  of  intracavity  spectroscopy  is  the  simultaneous  coverage  of  a  broad 
spectral domain, similar to the laser gain bandwidth. 
 
The development of ICLAS in the infrared spectral range, despite its obvious benefits, 
has been hampered by a lack of availability of appropriate lasers (cryogenic operation, high 
pump  power,  narrow  gain  profile,  pulsed  mode  operation,  restricted  spectral  areas)  and  less 
efficient spectroscopic approaches. However, the method has been demonstrated with broad 
gain medium lasers such as Cr4+:YAG 3 or Co:MgF2.4   
 
Recent  progress  in  semiconductor  laser  technology  has  generated  new  interest  in 
spectroscopic experiments in the infrared.  The result: low cost, compact and bright devices 
are becoming available up to 24 µm.5 Continuous wave systems with tens of milliwatts power 
at room temperature exist up to 9 µm,6 and broadband simultaneous coverage from 6 to 8 µm 
has been reported.7  Sensitivities of the order of 10-10 cm-1 have been achieved with ICLAS8 
using  Multiple  Quantum  Wells  (MQW)  Vertical  Cavity  Surface  Emitting  Lasers  (VCSEL) 
around  1  µm.    This  represents  an  improvement  in  sensitivity  by  four  orders  of  magnitude 
compared  with  index  guided  diode  lasers.9  The  technique  has  been  successfully  applied  in 
spectroscopic  studies.10  VCSEL  can  be  operated  at  ~  room  temperature  up  to  3.1  µm.11  
Extending  the  ICLAS  technique  to  the  infrared  region  should  yield  many  benefits.    This 
extension will be greatly facilitated by the use of Fourier transform spectrometers (FTS) since 
grating  spectrometers  with  diode  arrays  are  either  not  available,  very  expensive,  or  of  poor 
quality.    There  are  a  limited  number  of  ICLAS  measurements  using  FTS  that  have  been 
performed in the visible region of the spectrum.12,13,14 
 
In this letter, we demonstrate that exploiting a recent development made on our time-
resolved  Fourier  transform  spectrometer  (TRFTS)15  and  combining  the  two  techniques, 
ICLAS  with  VCSELs  and  TRFTS,  yields  a  technique  with  new  and  specific  advantages.  
Spectra are obtained around 1 µm for absorption path lengths (APL) of many kilometers using 
our step-scan interferometer with an intracavity laser absorption set-up based on an optically 
pumped  VCSEL.    Below,  specific  advantages  of  the  method,  especially  for  frequency  and 
intensity metrology of weak absorption transitions, are discussed. 
 
The  experimental  intracavity  set-up,  shown  in  Fig.1,  is  based  on  a  VCSEL  emitting 
around  1050  nm  in  an  external  cavity  configuration.  The  VCSEL  structure  was  grown  by 
molecular  beam  epitaxy.  Its  InGaAs  quantum  wells  active  medium  and  its  antireflection 
structure needed for the external cavity configuration are similar to the ones described in Ref 
8.  The  difference  is  that  a  metal  mirror  is  placed  behind  the  GaAs/AlAs  Distributed  Bragg 
Reflector  (DBR)  M1  in  order  to  avoid  back  reflections  from  the  substrate,  and  the  gain 
structure  contains  3  pairs  of  quantum  wells  in  a  7/2-wavelength  cavity.  The  three-mirror 
standing-wave cavity is made of (M1), a spherical (150 mm radius curvature) high-reflectivity 
folding mirror (M2) and a flat output coupler (M3). This L-shaped cavity has a 1-m long arm 
in which an intracavity cell can be inserted. The semiconductor chip is soldered onto a copper 
heat  sink  and  is  temperature-stabilized  by  a  Peltier  element  linked  to  a  30W  temperature 
controller.  Tunability  is  achieved  through  temperature  variation  of  the  chip  (–  0.8  nm/°C)

and/or  by  moving  the  chip  and  taking  advantage  of  growth  rate  nonuniformity.  Frequency 
drifts  are  of  the  order  of  6  MHz/min.  8  The  pumping  radiation  from  a  continuous  fiber-
coupled  1-W  830  nm  diode  laser  is  focused  into  the  gain  region.  The  pump  current  is 
alternately switched above and below the VCSEL threshold (80 mW), therefore initiating the 
VCSEL spectro-temporal dynamics. Laser pulses have durations chosen between 300 µs and 
1  ms.  The  spectral  width  of  the  VCSEL  emission  is  at  most  6  nm,  near  threshold,  for  low 
generation times.   

Optics Letters 28, 313-315, 2003 

Accurate  time  sampling  and  full  spectral  record  of  the  laser  pulse  are  specific 
advantages  brought  by  TRFTS,  with  easy  a  posteriori  corrections  of  the  possible  frequency 
and  intensity  fluctuations.  The  VCSEL  output  is  sent  into  the  step-scan  time-resolved 
interferometer,  equipped  with  infrasil  beam  splitter  and  silicon  photodetectors.    At  a  given 
path  difference  step,  several  time  samples  are  taken  from  a  given  laser  pulse  and  several 
pulses are averaged. At the end of the experiment, according to the data acquisition procedure 
explained  in  15,  there  are  as  many  interferograms  as  there  are  time  samples  .  Each  time-
component  interferogram  corresponds  to  a  given  APL.  The  time  between  two  consecutive 
time-components leads to the increment of the APL. 

Figure  2  shows  an  atmospheric  absorption  spectrum  (without  the  intracavity  cell) 
made  of  114  time-components.  Typically,  from  64  to  512  time-components  are  recorded. 
Each  time-component  is  here  made  of  10,000  samples,  obtained  after  an  acquisition  time 
equal to 32 ms. The experiment lasts less than half an hour. The spectral range is limited only 
by  the  laser  emission.  The  instrumental  spectral  resolution  is  equal  to  the  width  of  the  air-
broadened water lines. Thirty-two co-additions have been performed to improve the signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR). The electronic bandwidth of the acquisition system is 10 MHz and the time 
between two consecutive time-components is 3.2 µs. In other words, the APL is increased by 
~ 960 m from one spectrum to the next. With a pumping power 10 percents above the laser 
threshold  the  APL  grows  linearly  up  to  130  km.  Due  to  non-linear  mode  couplings,  this 
linearity vanishes at higher path lengths. The SNR is better than 100, leading to a sensitivity 
of  1  10-10  cm-1.Hz-1/2.  Due  to  the  specific  interferometric  approach,15  the  present  results 
compared  with  the  best  previous  ICLAS-FTS  experiment13  show  an  improvement  by  three 
orders  of  magnitude  of  the  sensitivity  at  1  second  averaging  time.  Another  time-resolved 
spectrum made of 512 time-components is presented in Figure 3. For the sake of clarity, one 
component out of 20, from components number 80 to 420 are plotted. Comparison with the 
HITRAN16 molecular database reveals the presence of never-measured lines. 

In  addition  to  the  benefits  in  the  infrared  (where  other  sensitive  spectroscopic 
techniques  exist,17,18  but  are  not  as  numerous  as  in  the  visible),  the  ICLAS-TRFTS 
combination  opens  new  opportunities  in  the  field  of  wideband  sensitive  high-resolution 
spectroscopy.  As  shown  above,  a  set  of  time-component  spectra  with  APLs  of  many 
kilometers in arithmetic progression is obtained. Due to the particular nature of the step-scan 
data acquisition, these time-components share many features; the recording time, resolution, 
SNR, and the entire spectral range with no need of concatenation are identical.  The results 
benefit  from  the  usual  advantages  of  accuracy  and  resolution  of  FTS  over  multichannel 
grating spectrometers.  
 
We also note, the perfect separation between time and spectral dimensions brings all 
time-components on exactly the same wavenumber scale. Hence, frequency metrology can be 
performed  with  accuracy  for  profiles  over  a  large  range  of  absorption  coefficients.  Indeed, 
absolute frequency standards from saturated absorption laser spectroscopy may be used, since 
they are generally intense, to calibrate the lower APL spectra. The absolute positions of the 
weaker lines, well observed in the longer APL time-components, may then be measured with 
approximately the same accuracy provided by the laser techniques on unsaturated profiles. As 
far  as  the  spectroscopic  parameters  are  concerned,  it  is  noteworthy  that  only  a  very  small 
fraction of the ICLAS papers report intensity determination.  Here the sample is observed for

all  time-components,  under  identical  pressure  and  temperature  conditions,  which  are  easily 
measured due to the small size of the cell. Moreover, multispectrum-fitting procedures may 
take  advantage  of  the  great  number  of  time-components  available.  The  resulting  efficient 
reduction of systematic errors leads to improved determination of spectroscopic parameters, 
as recently demonstrated.19 
This  work  demonstrates  that  MQW-VCSEL-based  ICLAS  experiments  coupled  with  a 
TRFTS  interferometer  are  well  adapted  for  high-sensitivity  laboratory  spectroscopy. 
Moreover, specific benefits of this coupling allow accurate measurements of both frequency 
and  line  shape  parameters.  In  addition,  this  work  opens  the  door  to  new  perspectives  of 
wideband sensitive spectroscopy extended to the infrared region.

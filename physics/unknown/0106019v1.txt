ABSTRACT  The thermodynamic properties for  three different  types  of  off-lattice  four-strand
β−sheet  protein  models  interacting  via  a  hybrid  Go-type  potential  have  been  investigated.
Discontinuous molecular dynamic simulations have been performed for different sizes of the bias
gap  g,  an  artificial  measure  of  a  model  protein’s  preference  for  its  native  state.  The
thermodynamic transition temperatures are obtained by calculating the squared radius of gyration
2,  the  root-mean-squared  pair  separation  fluctuation  ∆B,  the  specific  heat  Cv,  the  internal
Rg
energy of the system E, and the Lindemann disorder parameter ∆L. In spite of the simplicity, the
protein-like  heteropolymers  have  shown  a  complex  set  of  protein  transitions  as  observed  in
experimental  studies.  Starting  from  high  temperature,  these  transitions  include  a  collapse
transition,  a  disordered-to-ordered  globule  transition,  a  folding  transition,  and  a  liquid-to-solid
transition. These transitions strongly depend on the native-state geometry of the model proteins
and the size of the bias gap. A strong transition from the disordered globule state to the ordered
globule state with large energy change and a weak transition from the ordered globule state to the
native state with small energy change were observed for the large gap models. For the small gap
models  no  native  structures  were  observed  at  any  temperature,  all  three  β−sheet  proteins  fold
into a partially-ordered globule state which is geometrically different from the native state. For
small bias gaps at even lower temperatures, all protein motions are frozen indicating an inactive
solid-like phase.

Keywords    discontinuous  molecular  dynamics,  bias  gap,  off-lattice,  Go-type  potential,  protein
transitions, β−amyloid peptide.

INTRODUCTION

Proteins  are  macromolecules  that  fold  into  a  specific  native  conformation  to  perform  their
biological  function  under  physiological  conditions.  When  they  aggregate  abnormally  in  vivo,
however,  the  consequences  are  serious  biomedical  problems  that  include  a  host  of  ultimately
fatal protein deposition diseases  (Clark and Steele,  1992; Eaton and Hofrichter,  1990;  Gallo  et
al., 1996; Massry and Glasscock, 1983; Moore  and Melton, 1997). An  example is Alzheimer’s
disease  (Selkoe,  1991;  Simmons  et  al.,  1994);  it  is  thought  to  be  caused  by  the  abnormal
deposition of insoluble fibril plaques in the extracellular space of brain tissue during aging. The
major component of plaques is a 39- to 43- residue β−peptide, called β−amyloid peptide (Aβ),
whose  predominant  secondary  structure  in  the  fibril  is  a  β−strand.  Although  recent  extensive
experimental studies (Benzinger et al., 1998, 2000; Burkoth et al., 1998; Esler et al., 1996, 2000;
Lazo and Cowning, 1998; Lynn and Meredith, 2000; Sunde et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2000) have
gone  a  long  way  toward  revealing  the  properties  and  physiological  functions  of  β−amyloid
peptide (Aβ), the  causes  of amyloid  fibril  formation  are  largely  unknown  and  the  fundamental
mechanisms underlying aggregation of β−amyloid are still under investigation. Thus, it would be

1

of interest to see if computer simulations can offer any insights into the basic principles behind
folding and aggregation of peptides made up of β−strands.

The aim of this study is to investigate the thermodynamic properties of β−strand proteins.
The ultimate goal of our work is to reveal the mechanisms underlying protein aggregation with
particular  focus  on  the  role  played  by  β−strands.  In  order  to  study  protein  aggregation  by
computer  simulation,  one  must  devise  protein  models  that  capture  not  only  the  basic  physical
features of real proteins, but also allow the simulation  of  many  proteins  with current computer
capability. At present, protein models for computer simulations of folding can be divided mainly
into  two  types:  high-resolution  models  and  low-resolution  models.  High-resolution  or  all-atom
models (Brooks et al., 1983; Ferrara and Caflisch, 2000; Lazaridis and Karplus, 1997; Weiner et
al.,  1986)  include  detailed  information  on  protein  geometry  and  motion  and  yield  useful
information on the folding of a single real protein at short times. However computer limitations
preclude  simulating  for  more  than  one  µs  (Duan  and  Kollman,  1998).  Since  aggregation  time
scales  are  considerably  longer  than  folding  time  scales,  all-atom  representations  are  too
cumbersome to allow for a meaningful description of the folding and aggregation of many chain
systems.

In marked contrast to high-resolution models, low-resolution or simplified protein models
offer  the  opportunity  to  study  the  behavior  of  multi-protein  systems.  These  models  provide
numerous  insights  into  the  thermodynamic  and  kinetic  properties  of  protein  folding.  The  low-
resolution  models  employed  in  simulation  studies  of  protein  folding  can  be  divided  into  two
classes: on-lattice (Chan and Dill, 1994; Dill and Stigter, 1995; Go and Taketomi, 1978, 1979;
Gupta and Hall, 1997, 1998; Gupta et al., 1999; Kolinski et al., 1995; Lau and Dill, 1989; Miller
et  al.,  1992;  Skolnick  and  Kolinski,  1991;  Taketomi  et  al.,  1975;  Ueda  et  al.,  1978)  and  off-
lattice models (Dokholyan et al., 1998, 2000; Guo and Thirumalai, 1995, 1996; Guo and Brooks
III, 1997; Guo et al., 1997; Nymeyer et al., 1998; Pande and Rokhsar, 1998; Shea et al., 2000;
Takada  et  al,.  1999;  Zhou  and  Karplus,  1997a,  1997b,  1999).  The  first  low-resolution  lattice
models of proteins were introduced by Go et al. (Go and Taketomi, 1978, 1979; Taketomi et al.,
1975; Ueda et al., 1978) in the late 70s. In their models, the protein was treated as a sequence of
beads on a two- or three-dimensional lattice with the native tertiary structure being determined
by introducing a set of pre-assigned attractive residue-residue pairs at the nearest-neighbor lattice
sites.  Another  class  of  lattice  model  used  to  describe  protein  folding  is  the  HP  lattice  model
proposed by Lau and Dill (1989). To mimic the hydrophobic effect, the protein is modeled as a
chain of polar (P) and hydrophobic (H) residues with an attractive potential between non-bonded
H beads and zero potential between non-bonded H and P or P and P residues. Simulation results
for  H-P  models  have  provided  useful  information  on  protein  folding-refolding  pathways  for
isolated  chains  (Chan  and  Dill,  1994;  Gupta  and  Hall,  1997;  Gupta  et  al.,  1999;  Miller  et  al.,
1992) and protein aggregation for multi-chain systems (Dill and Stigter, 1995; Gupta and Hall,
1998).

Recently, off-lattice models have gained attention as they can more accurately represent
the real features of proteins. Guo et al. (Guo and Thirumalai, 1995, 1996; Guo and  Brooks III,
1997;  Guo  et  al.,  1997)  have  investigated  the  thermodynamics  and  kinetics  of  protein  folding
using Langevin simulations on off-lattice protein models. Their heteropolymer models consist of
N connected  beads  which  correspond to three types of  residues:  hydrophobic,  hydrophilic,  and
neutral. They  found two  characteristic  temperatures,  a  collapse  transition  temperature  Tθ  and  a
folding  transition  temperature  Tf  in  their  thermodynamic  studies  of  β−barrel  and  four-helix
bundle  proteins.  Zhou  and  Karplus  (1997a,  1997b,  1999)  recently  introduced  an  off-lattice

2

heteropolymer model for a three-helix bundle protein with a hybrid Go-type potential. They used
a  bias  gap  parameter,  g,  to  vary  the  strength  of  native  contacts  relative  to  that  of  non-native
contacts.  In  spite  of  the  model’s  simplicity,  thermodynamic  studies  on  this  protein-like  model
exhibit complex protein transitions that have been observed experimentally including a collapse
transition,  a  disordered  globule  to  ordered  globule  transition,  an  ordered  globule  to  native
transition,  and  a  transition  to  a  surface  frozen  inactive  state  (Ptitsyn,  1995).  In  a  study  of  the
model’s folding kinetics, Zhou and Karplus (1997a, 1997b, 1999) found that the larger the bias
gap (closer it is to native state) the faster the protein folds. Well-defined folding pathways for the
larger gap model showed a fast folding with no intermediates or slower folding with misfolded
intermediates,  while  the  smaller  gap  model  exhibited  long-lived  intermediates  with  multiple
pathways to the native state.

In  this  paper  we  investigate  the  thermodynamic  phase  behavior  of  three  different  four-
strand  antiparallel  β−sheet  peptides:  the  β−double-hairpin,  the  β−clip,  and  the  β−twist.  These
β−strand peptides have different native state conformations, as shown in Fig. 1. This work is a
first  step  in  our  effort  to  understand  the  aggregation  of  β−amyloid  peptides.  Our  off-lattice
heteropolymer  models  contain  39  connected  beads,  and  each  bead  represents  an  amino  acid
residue.  Non-bonded  beads  can  interact  through  hybrid  Go-type  potential  (Go  and  Taketomi,
1978,  1979;  Taketomi  et  al.,  1975;  Ueda  et  al.,  1978)  modeled  as  a  square-well  or  square-
shoulder potential depending on the value of the bias gap parameter g. Discontinuous molecular
dynamic (DMD) simulations (Alder and Wainwright, 1959; Rapaport, 1978; Smith et al., 1996)
for bias gaps ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 were performed. The bias gap measures the difference in
interaction  strength  between  the  native  and  non-native  contacts:  the  larger  it  is  the  more  the
native state is favored over the non-native state. Intermediate values of the bias gap are thought
to  be  the  most  representative  of  a  real  protein  in  the  equilibrium  and  dynamic  behavior.  By
exploring  how  variations  in  our  model  protein’s  bias  gap,  an  artificial  measure  of  its
“preference” for  the  native state,  influence the types of phase behavior observed,  we can  get a
feeling for how a real protein’s preference for its native state, as measured  for example  by the
energy  difference  between  the  denatured  and  native  state,  is  manifested  in  the  protein’s  phase
2,
diagram and vice versa. Thermodynamic quantities such as the squared radius of gyration, Rg
the root-mean-squared pair separation fluctuation, ∆B, the specific heat, Cv, the internal energy,
E, and the Lindemann disorder parameter, ∆L, were calculated during equilibrium simulations at
several different temperatures.

Highlights  of  our  results  are  the  following.  We  find  that  the  β−sheet  proteins  have
complex  protein  transitions  that  are  qualitatively  similar  to  those  seen  in  the  thermodynamic
studies of three-helix bundle proteins (Zhou and Karplus, 1997a, 1997b, 1999), even though the
geometric  structures  of  the  two  models  are  different.  Starting  from  high  temperature,  these
transitions  include  a  collapse  transition,  a  disordered-to-ordered  globule  transition,  a  folding
transition,  and  a  liquid-to-solid  transition  for  all  values  of  the  bias  gap.  The  high  temperature
transitions, i.e. the collapse transition and the disordered-to-ordered globule transition, exist for
all  three  β−sheet  proteins,  although  the  native-state  geometry  of  the  three  model  proteins  is
different. However the  low temperature  transitions, i.e. the  folding  transition and the liquid-to-
solid transition, strongly depend on the native-state geometry of the model proteins and the size
of the bias  gap.  For  small  bias  gaps  at  low  temperatures,  all  three  β−sheet  proteins  fold  into  a
partially-ordered globule state which is geometrically different from the native  state.  For small
bias gaps at even lower temperatures, all protein motions are frozen indicating an inactive solid-
like phase. For large bias gaps at low temperatures, all three β−sheet proteins fold into the native

3

state.  For  large  bias  gaps  at  even  lower  temperatures,  the  β−double-hairpin  model  exhibits  no
solid-like phase above  T* = 0.07,  the lowest  temperature studied,  while the  β–clip  and  β–twist
models  exhibit  a  solid-like  phase  for  all  values  of  g.    The  Lindemann  criterion  (Lindemann,
1910) suggests that the native state for the β−double-hairpin is a molten globule since all of the
beads  exhibit  liquid-like  motion.  In  contrast,  the  native  states  of  the  other  two  model  proteins
near  the  liquid-to-solid  transition  are  surface-molten  solids,  since  core  beads  exhibit  inactive
solid-like motion and surface beads exhibit liquid-like motion.

THE MODELS AND SIMULATION METHOD

We  consider  three  different  off-lattice  protein  models  whose  native  states  are  four-strand
antiparallel  β−sheets.  The  global  energy  minimum  structures  for  the  three  different  β−sheet
models  are  shown  in  Fig.  1.  The  “zig-zag”  shaped  native  protein  in  Fig.  1(a)  is  called  a
β−double-hairpin;  sometimes  it  is  known  as  betabellin  (Lim  et  al.,  2000).  The  paper-clip  and
helix-shaped  native  structures  in  Fig.  1(b)  and  1(c)  are  called  β−clip  and  β−twist,  respectively
(Kolinski et al., 1995). A qualitative difference between the β−double-hairpin structure and the
other  two  structures  is  immediately  apparent.  In  the  native  state,  the  β−double-hairpin  is  two-
dimensional  (planar),  while  the  β−clip  and  β−twist  have  well-defined  three-dimensional  four-
2 σ , the total number of
barrel structures. The reduced squared radius of gyration per bead,

native  contacts, 
global  energy  minimum  structures  are  summarized  in  Table  1.  Here  N  is  the  number  of  beads
and  σ  is  the  diameter  of  each  bead  along  the  chain.  Note  that  chains  with  a  large  number  of
native contacts are generally more compact and consequently have a small value of the squared
radius of gyration.

Each  model  protein  contains  39  connected  beads.  Each  bead  represents  an  amino  acid
residue that can be regarded as being localized  at the Cα atom. Non-bonded  beads can interact
with each other through a square-well or square-shoulder potential (Zhou et al., 1996,1997),

where σ is the bead diameter, ε is an energy parameter with ε > 0, λσ is the square-well diameter
with  λ  =  1.5  throughout,  and  r  is  the  distance  between  residues  i  and  j.  The  quantity  Bijε,  the
square-well  depth  or  square-shoulder  height,  represents  the  interaction  strength  between  non-
bonded residue pair i and j and is defined as

where BN and BO are measures of the relative strengths of the energies associated with the native
and  non-native  pair  interactions  in  this  Go-type  potential  (Go  and  Taketomi,  1978,  1979;

Taketomi et al., 1975; Ueda et al., 1978). Non-bonded  pairs of  beads  that are in  contact in the
global  energy  minimum  structure  experience  an  attractive  interaction,  i.e.  BN  <  0,  when  their
square-wells overlap. On the other hand, non-bonded pairs of beads that are not in contact in the
global  energy  minimum  structure  experience  either  an  attractive  interaction  (BO  <  0)  or  a
repulsive interaction (BO > 0). The parameter BO can be either positive or negative depending on
the size of the bias gap parameter g,

where g is the bias gap (Zhou and Karplus, 1997a, 1997b, 1999). The bias gap measures the ratio
of the interaction strength between the native contacts and non-native contacts. Note that for g >
1,  BO  >  0  ;  in  this  case  non-native  contacts  are  repulsive  so  that  the  native  state  structure  is
strongly  favored  over  any  non-native  state  structure.  For  0  <  g  <  1,  BO  <  0  ;  all  non-bonded
contact  pairs  are  attractive  but  native  contacts  are  always  more  favorable  than  non-native
contacts.  For  g  =  0,  native  and  non-native  contacts  are  equally  favorable,  BO  =  BN;  the  model
reduces to a homopolymer. The bias gap is an artificial measure of a model protein’s preference
for  its  native  state;  in  a  real  protein  this  preference  for  the  native  state  might  be  measured  for
example by the energy difference between the native and non-native state.

The  interaction  between  two  bonded  beads,  i  and  i  +  1,  is  given  by  an  infinitely  deep

where  δ  is  a  flexibility  parameter  which  controls  the  bond-length.  The  bond  length  between
neighboring  beads  can  be  varied  over  a  small  distance  between  the  infinitely  high  potential
barriers at (1−δ)σ and (1+δ)σ. This method for creating a flexible bond length was introduced by
Bellemans et al. (1980), and is known as Bellemans bond. The flexible bond-length parameter is
set to δ  = 0.1 through the paper.

Simulations  were  performed  using  the  discontinuous  molecular  dynamics  (DMD)
algorithm  (Alder  and  Wainwright,  1959;  Rapaport,  1978;  Smith  et  al.,  1996).  All  simulations
were  started  from  randomly  generated  configurations  which  were  obtained  from  self-avoiding
random  walks.  The  initial  velocities  were  chosen  at  random  from  a  Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution at the simulation temperature. This DMD algorithm is very efficient for calculating
the  properties  of  systems  containing  hard  spheres  or  square-well  spheres  (Smith  et  al.,  1996;
Zhou et al., 1997) and is significantly faster than standard molecular dynamics on Lennard-Jones
chains.  The  algorithm  proceeds  by  searching  for  the  next  collision  time  and  collision  pair,
advancing all beads in time to the next collision event, and then calculating the velocity change
of  the  colliding  pair.  The  DMD  simulation  was  conducted  in  the  canonical  ensemble  with  a
constant  number  of  particles,  volume,  and  temperature.  In  order  to  maintain  constant
temperature,  the  Andersen  stochastic  collision  method  (Andersen,  1980)  was  used.  In  this
method  the  system’s  particles  collide  with  imaginary  or  ghost  particles  which  serve  as  an
effective heat bath. In the collision with the imaginary particles, the velocity of each bead is re-
assigned from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at the simulation temperature. A reduced ghost

5

* ≡ ngσ3 = 0.1, where ng is the number density of ghost particles, was used to
particle density of ng
ensure that 1% ~ 10% of the collisions were ghost particle collisions (Zhou and Karplus, 1999;
Zhou et al., 1997).

In order to determine the location of the collapse transition, the mean-squared radius of

gyration, Rg

weighted  histogram  method  (Ferrenberg  and  Swendsen,  1989;  Zhou  et  al.,  1997)  was  used.  In
this  method,  temperature-independent  degeneracy  factors  are  extracted  from  the  energy
probability distribution in simulation runs at different temperatures. Once the degeneracy factors
are  known,  a  partition  function  is  obtained  for  any  temperature,  and  consequently  all
thermodynamic  quantities  can  be  calculated.  Details  of  the  method  were  reported  elsewhere

(Zhou et al., 1997). By plotting Cv
one can determine the equilibrium transitions from the locations of the peaks and plateaus.

where bead positions, ri (i = 1 to N), are obtained by shifting the center of mass coordinates to
the  origin.  The  quantity  ∆Li  in  Eq.  (9)  defines  the  Lindemann  disorder  parameter  for  an
individual bead, and ∆L in Eq. (10) defines the Lindemann disorder parameter. The Lindemann
criterion  (Lindemann,  1910)  is  applied  to  the  system  to  determine  the  solid  or  liquid  phase.  A
system is regarded as a solid if its Lindemann disorder parameter, ∆L, is in  the range of 0.1 to
0.15 (Bilgram, 1987; Löwen, 1994; Stillinger, 1995; Zhou et al., 1999), while a substance with
∆L > 0.15 is considered liquid.

The  progression  of  a  conformation  towards  the  native  state  can  be  monitored  by
introducing  the  fraction  of  native  contacts  formed  (Lazaridis  and  Karplus,  1997;  Šali  et  al.,
1994), Q, defined by

where Nnative represents the number of native contacts in a given conformation and 
 is the
total number of native contacts in the  global energy minimum  structure.  The fraction  of  native
contacts Q has a value between 0 to 1. When Q = 1 the model system can be regarded as being in
the  native  structure,  while  when  Q  →  0  the  chain  becomes  a  random  coil  that  indicates  the
denatured state.

Simulations  were  performed  for  up  to  109  collisions  to  ensure  equilibration.  Each
simulation  was  started  from  a  different  initial  configuration  at  the  temperature  of  interest.
Equilibrium  averages  were  typically  taken  by  discarding  the  first  half  of  the  simulation.  All
equilibrium  results  were  averaged  over  at  least  four  independent  runs.  For  simulations  at  low
temperature, a random initial configuration was generated at a relatively high temperature of T* =
1.0,  and  then  gradually  annealed  toward  the  target  temperature  after  which  the  equilibrium
simulation  was  performed. This procedure  can  prevent the  system  from  becoming trapped in a
metastable state, i.e. a local free-energy minimum. Simulations were performed for bias gaps in
the range of g = 0.3 to 1.5 at reduced temperatures in the range T* = 0.07 to 5.0.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Thermodynamic properties of ββββ−−−−double-hairpin

DMD simulations were performed for the β−double-hairpin protein to investigate phase behavior
as a function of the size of the bias gap. At bias gaps of g = 0.3, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.3, thermodynamic
2,  the  root-mean-squared  pair  separation
averages  including  the  squared  radius  of  gyration  Rg
fluctuation ∆B, the specific heat  Cv,  and  the  internal  energy  E  were  calculated  as  a  function  of
temperature. These results for g = 0.3, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.3 are shown in Figs. 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), and
2(d), respectively. All quantities are described in terms of reduced units in the figures. Statistical
averages  were  obtained  over  at  least  four  independent  simulations.  The  error  bars  are  the
standard deviation in the measured values and are only shown for values larger than the size of
the  symbol.  The  results  for  the  specific  heat  and  the  energy  were  obtained  using  the  same
weighted histogram method (Ferrenberg and Swendsen, 1989) that was introduced in the study
of homopolymers (Zhou et al., 1997). The equilibrium transition temperatures of the model can
be  identified  from  the  maximum  value  of  the  temperature  derivative  of  the  squared  radius  of
gyration, dRg

2/dT*, and/or from peaks or plateaus in the specific heat.

To determine the collapse transition, the temperature derivative of the squared radius of
2 versus T* graphs as shown in
2/dT*, is calculated along a spline fit of the data in Rg
gyration, dRg
2/dT* occurs at T* =
Fig. 2. For a small bias gap, g = 0.3, in Fig. 2(a) the maximum value of dRg
1.47 indicating the collapse transition temperature. For g = 0.7, 0.9, and 1.3 in Figs. 2(b), 2(c),
and  2(d),  they  occur  at  T*  =  1.0,  0.95,  and  0.88,  respectively.  The  chain  has  a  conformational
change  from  a  random  coil  to  the  disordered  globule  state  at  the  collapse  transition.  The
disordered  globule  has  more  native  contacts  than  that  for  the  random  coil,  but  due  to  the
disordered  nature  of  the  state,  none  of  the  structures  appear  to  be  a  well  ordered  native-like.
Additional evidence for the existence of the collapse transition at g = 0.3 is that the 〈∆B〉 versus
T* curve possesses a broad, but clear, maximum located at a temperature just above T* = 1.47. In
addition, a plateau in the specific heat is observed near this temperature. In contrast to the broad
peak for g = 0.3 in the 〈∆B〉 curve, for g = 0.7, 0.9, and 1.3, there is a well-defined peak in the
〈∆B〉 curve that evidently supports the collapse transition. The collapse transition peak in the 〈∆B〉
versus T* curve  can be  explained  in  the following  way. The  root-mean-squared pair separation
fluctuation  〈∆B〉  increases,  as  expected,  as  T*  increases  but  then  decreases  above  the  collapse
transition  temperature  because  the  stretched  chain  in  the  random  coil  state  is  constrained  by
chain connectivity, resulting in less fluctuations in the bead-bead separations

The transition from the disordered globule state to the ordered globule state is associated
with  a  distinct  peak  in  the  specific  heat.  This  transition  is  strong  with  large  energy  change
indicating a large conformational change. For g = 0.3, the peak is found at a temperature of T* =
0.58, far below the collapse transition. This indicates that the disordered globule is a stable state
over a wide temperature range; a trend characteristic of smaller values of g. However, for g = 1.3
the  peak  is  found  at  a  temperature  of  T*  =  0.80,  only  slightly  below  the  collapse  transition
temperature.  The  collapse  transition  will  eventually  coincide  with  the  disordered-to-ordered
transition for g > 1.5.

The folding transition from the ordered globule state to the native state can be identified
from the plateaus in the specific heat. At this transition, there are no major changes in structure,
but  the  chain  has  a  subtle  conformational  change  toward  the  native  state.  For  the  smaller  gap
models, g = 0.3, no evidence for the folding transition was observed. This is because for g < 0.7,

8

a  well-ordered  native  state  does  not  appear  to  exist;  instead  kinked  or  rolled  structures  were
observed. Consequently, no plateaus associated with the folding transition were observed for the
smaller  gap  models.  For  the  g  =  0.7  model,  although  a  peak  in  the  specific  heat  is  found  at  a
temperature of T* = 0.35, the peak is not related to the folding transition. It is associated with the
transition from the ordered globule state to a more-collapsed ordered  globule state that we will
call the partially-ordered globule state. For the larger gap models, g = 0.9 and 1.3, the plateaus at
T* = 0.40 in the specific  heat  are  associated  with  the  folding  transition.  This  folding  transition
temperature is much lower than the disordered-to-ordered globule transition. This indicates that
the ordered globule is a stable state over a wide temperature range for the larger gap models.

The results for the β−double-hairpin that we have just described are summarized in Fig. 3
which shows the phases that occur in the space spanned by the reduced temperature T* and the
bias gap g. The diagram shows a complex set of protein transitions that is qualitatively similar to
those observed for a model three-helix bundle protein (Zhou and Karplus, 1997a, 1997b, 1999).
However, some quantitative differences between the β−double-hairpin results and the three-helix
bundle results are immediately apparent. This is indicated in the figure by drawing solid lines for
transitions that are qualitatively the same transitions as those observed for the three-helix bundle
protein and dotted lines for transitions which are not observed in the three-helix bundle protein.
The upper line in the figure indicates the collapse transition; it separates the random coil phase
from  the  disordered  globule  phase.  Moving  down  in  the  figure,  the  second  line  from  the  top
indicates the transition from the disordered globule to the ordered globule; it is obtained from the
first peak in the specific heat. The third line from the top is a folding transition for g > 0.7, that
separates the ordered globule from the native state and a collapse transition to a partially-ordered
globule  (different  from  the  native  state)  for  0.3  <  g  <  0.7.  As  described  later  in  this  paper  the
partially-ordered globule state contains kinked or rolled structures which are distinctly different
from  their  native  state  conformation.  Interestingly,  for  0.7  <  g  <  0.9,  we  observed  a  transition
from the native state to the partially-ordered globule state that is not observed in the three-helix
bundle protein. This transition is associated with the specific heat peak for g = 0.7 at T* = 0.35
and the small specific heat peak for g = 0.9 at T* = 0.115. For g < 0.9 a transition occurs at low
temperature to a solid phase; this is obtained through application of the Lindemann criterion as
will be discussed later. No solid phase was observed for g > 0.9 at any temperature investigated.
Two  triple  points  are  found:  one  at  g  =  0.3  and  T*  =  0.58  where  the  disordered,  ordered  and
partially-ordered globule phases meet, and one at g = 0.7 and T* = 0.35 where the native, ordered
and partially-ordered globule phases meet.

Folding of the β−double-hairpin strongly depends on the bias gap and temperature. A set
of  sample  structures  for  the  β−double-hairpin  characteristic  of  the  final  states  observed  during
the simulations is presented in Fig. 4 (a) for g = 0.7 at T* = 0.3, 4(b) for g = 0.7 at T* = 0.6, 4(c)
for g = 1.3 at T* = 0.5, and 4(d) for g = 1.3 at T* = 0.2. The structure in Fig 4(a) corresponds to
the partially-ordered globule, the kinked or rolled structure that appears at low temperature for g
<  0.7.  (Recall  that  no  native  state  structures  appear  at  any  temperatures  for  g  <  0.7.)  The
partially-ordered globule state occurs for smaller gap models because the attraction between non-
native contacts disturbs the tendency to order into the native state at low temperatures. Examples
of the ordered globules are shown in Figs. 4(b) and 4(c). The ordered  globule  has more native
contacts than the disordered globule. As g increases, the structure corresponding to the ordered
globule becomes more native-like (compare Figs. 4(b) and 4(c)). The native state structure of the
β−double-hairpin  is  shown  in  Fig.  4(d).  Note  that  for  the  off-lattice  β−double-hairpin  models
with g ≤ 0.7 none of the structures are the global energy minimum state, but for 0.7 < g < 1.0 the

9

geometry in the native state is very similar to the global energy minimum structure shown in Fig.
1(a)  so  that  the  number  of  native  contacts  is  very  close  to  that  of  the  global  energy  minimum
structure. For highly optimized models, g ≥ 1.0, the native state is the global energy  minimum
state (Zhou and Karplus, 1999).

 It is interesting to consider the variation in structural properties as folding progress. Fig.
5 shows the average value of the fraction of global energy minimum contacts formed (Lazaridis
and Karplus, 1997; Šali et al., 1994), 〈Q〉, as a function of temperature T  * and bias gap g. The
collapse transition occurs at 〈Q〉 ~ 0.2 for g = 0.3 and at 〈Q〉 ~ 0.3 for g = 1.3. The transition from
the disordered globule to the ordered globule occurs at 〈Q〉 values in the range of 〈Q〉 = 0.4 ~ 0.5
for all values of g. In the native state, we find that 〈Q〉 > 0.9 for g > 0.7, while for the partially-
ordered globule, 〈Q〉 has values in the range  from 0.6 to 0.9 depending on the size of g. In the
three-dimensional  graph,  the  flat  surface  at  the  top  of  the  rear  edge  corresponds  to  the  native
state with 〈Q〉 ~ 1 for g > 0.7.

Further information on the nature of the transition at low temperature can be obtained by
calculating the Lindemann disorder parameter (Lindemann, 1910). This parameter is often used
to analyze the liquid-to-solid transition (Bilgram, 1987; Löwen, 1994; Stillinger, 1995; Zhou et
al.,  1999).  Fig.  6(a)  shows  the  average  value  of  the  Lindemann  disorder  parameter,  〈∆L〉,  as  a
function of temperature for two selected values of the bias gap, g = 0.3 and 1.3. Each result for
∆L at given  temperature  is a sum of the  average of the root-mean-squared fluctuations  over  all
beads. A form of the Lindemann criterion for melting is adopted here in which systems with ∆L <
0.15 are  considered  solid-like,  while  systems  with  ∆L  >  0.15  are  considered  liquid.  The  dotted
line in Fig. 6(a) indicates the criterion for the liquid-to-solid transition. It can be seen that for g =
1.3, as was seen in the phase diagram, no solid phase is found at any investigated temperatures
because  ∆L > 0.15, whereas, for  g  =  0.3 the  liquid-to-solid  transition occurs  at  T*  =  0.19.  This
agrees well with the temperature at which the inflection in the root-mean-squared pair separation,
〈∆B〉, curve is found in Fig 2(a). Figs. 6(b) and 6(c) show the Lindemann disorder parameter for
the individual beads i, ∆Li, as a function of the reduced distance of bead i from the origin, |ri|/σ,
for 6(b) g = 0.3 at T* = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6, and 6(c) for g = 1.3 at T* = 0.2, 0.6, and 0.8. Note that
the bead positions, ri, are defined with respect to the origin at the chain’s center of mass. In Fig.
6(b),  which  corresponds  to  g  =  0.3,  the  three  selected  temperatures  correspond  to  the  three
different  phases  of  the  chain:  the  solid-like  phase,  partially-ordered  globule,  and  disordered
globule,  respectively.  At  high  temperature,  T*  =  0.6,  a  large  degree  of  freedom  in  the  bead
motion is observed. At low temperature, T* =  0.1,  the  small  bead  fluctuations  and  small  bead-
bead separations give rise to a solid-like phase for the chain. In Fig. 6(c), which corresponds to g
= 1.3, the three selected temperatures correspond to the three different phases of the chain: the
native state, ordered globule, and disordered globule, respectively. At high temperature, T* = 0.8,
the large bead fluctuations in the ∆Li graph indicate that the chain undergoes a transition from the
disordered  globule  to  the  ordered  globule.  At  low  temperature,  T*  =  0.2,  the  results  of  the
individual  bead  fluctuations  correspond  to  the  native  state.  The  native  protein  is  regarded  as  a
surface-molten solid, which means that the interior of native protein is solid-like, but the surface
is liquid-like phase (Zhou et al., 1999). However we find that the native β–double-hairpin at T* =
0.2 is not a surface-molten solid, since all the values of ∆Li are greater than 0.15, which means
that the system is considered liquid. Therefore, the native β–double-hairpin is more like a molten
globule  since  all  of  the  beads  exhibit  liquid-like  motion.  The  reason  that  the  native  β–double-
hairpin is not a surface-molten solid is that it is planar, and consequently the interior beads have

10

considerable freedom in their motion; they can move perpendicular to the molecular plane even
in the native state. This can be regarded  as a case in which the  topology  determines  the  phase
behavior.

To characterize the nature of the transitions displayed in Fig. 3, the energy distribution in
the transition region has been investigated. Fig. 7 shows the energy distribution 7(a) for g = 0.9
at T* = 0.7949 (the disordered-to-ordered globule transition), 7(b) for g = 0.9 at T* = 0.3998 (the
folding  transition),  and  7(c)  for  g  =  0.3  at  T*  =  0.5848  (the  disordered-to-partially-ordered
globule transition). The bimodal distribution in Fig. 7(a) for g = 0.9 indicates that the transition
from the disordered globule to the ordered  globule is a two-state transition; the  disordered and
ordered  globule  states  coexist  at  the  transition  temperature.  This  two-state  transition  can  be
regarded  as  a  first-order-like  transition,  since  as  pointed  out  by  Zhou  and  Karplus  (1999),  the
logarithm of the energy distribution via the weighted histogram method is directly proportional
to the free energy, and the existence of a bimodal shape in the  free energy distribution verifies
the  first-order-like  transition  (Zhou  et  al.,  1996,1997).  Note  that  this  two-state  transition  is
associated with the distinct peak in the specific heat as seen in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) which indicate
that the transition from the disordered globule to the ordered globule is strong with large energy
change.  The  transition  into  the  ordered  globule  is  a  two-state  only  for  g  ≥  0.9.  The  folding
transition in Fig. 7(b) for g = 0.9 is not two-state since no bimodal energy distribution exhibits.
This  indicates  that  the  ordered  globule  and  native  states  of  the  β–double-hairpin  are
geometrically  similar  to  each  other.  Hence,  the  folding  transition  is  weak  with  small  energy
change and is continuous between the two states. Note that this transition is associated with the
plateaus in the specific heat as seen in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d). For the transition from the disordered
globule  state  to  the  partially-ordered  globule  state  in  Fig.  7(c)  at  g  =  0.3,  the  transition  is
continuous even though it is associated with a distinct peak in the specific heat as seen in Fig.
2(a).  The  lack  of  a  bimodal  energy  distribution  for  g  =  0.3  suggests  that  the  disordered  and
partially-ordered globule structures are similar to each other.

The  thermodynamic  averages,  〈Rg
models are shown as a function of T* in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) (β–clip), and 8(c) and 8(d) (β–twist).
For brevity the figures only show results for two selected values of the bias gap, g = 0.3 and 1.3.
For the small bias gap, g = 0.3, the results in Figs. 8(a) for the β–clip and 8(c) for the β–twist are
qualitatively similar to those in Fig. 2(a) for the β–double-hairpin model at g = 0.3. However for
the large bias  gap,  g =  1.3,  the thermodynamic  averages  for both  the  β–clip model  and  the  β–
twist  model  (Figs.  8(b)  and  8(d)  respectively)  are  qualitatively  different  from  those  of  the  β–
2/σ2N〉 and
double-hairpin model at g = 1.3 in Fig. 2(d). The differences are that kinks in the 〈Rg
〈∆B〉 curves at low temperatures and a second peak in the specific heat in Figs. 8(b) and 8(d) are
observed  for  both  the  β–clip  model  and  the  β–twist  model,  but  not  for  the  β–double-hairpin
model in Fig. 2(d). The small peak in the specific heat is related to the folding transition, while
2/σ2N〉 and 〈∆B〉 curves at low temperatures are connected with the liquid-to-
the kinks in the 〈Rg
2/σ2N〉 at low temperatures for both the β–clip
solid transition. The reason for the increases in 〈Rg
model and the β–twist model at g = 1.3 is that the Rg
2 value of the native protein is larger than
that of the ordered globule, indicating that the collapsed chain undergoes a subtle conformational
change from the ordered globule to the native state by elongating its strand.

11

The Lindemann disorder parameters are shown as a function of temperature and the bias
gap  for  the  β–clip  and  β–twist  in  Fig.  9(a)  and  9(b)  respectively.  It  can  be  seen  that  for  both
models the locations of the kinks in the 〈∆L〉 curves at low temperatures and large g are consistent
2/σ2N〉 and 〈∆B〉 curves as seen in Figs. 8(b) and
with those at low temperatures found in the 〈Rg
8(d). The solid-like phase with ∆L < 0.15 is prevalent at low temperature for the β–clip and β–
twist models. Sharp increases at high temperatures in the 〈∆L〉 curves for the large gap models are
2/σ2N〉 curves and with the peaks in the 〈∆B〉 curves in
also consistent with those found in the 〈Rg
Figs. 8(b) and 8(d) indicating the collapse transition.

Figures 10(a) and 10(b) show the Lindemann disorder parameter for an individual bead,
∆Li, 10(a) for the β–clip model with g = 0.9 at T* = 0.1, 0.26, and 0.5, and 10(b) for the β–twist
model with g = 0.7 at T* = 0.1, 0.28, and 0.6. For both the β–clip and β–twist models, those three
selected temperatures correspond to the three different phases of the chain: the solid-like phase,
the native state, and the ordered globule, respectively. In the native states near the liquid-to-solid
transition (β–clip with g = 0.9 at T* = 0.26 in Fig. 10(a) and β–twist with g = 0.7 at T* = 0.28 in
Fig. 10(b)), we find that the interiors of the chains are solid-like with ∆Li < 0.15, but the surfaces
are liquid-like with ∆Li > 0.15. Thus the native proteins for the  β–clip and β–twist are surface-
molten  solids.  At  low  temperature,  T*  =  0.1,  for  both  the  β–clip  and  β–twist  models,  the  bead
motions are frozen with all ∆Li < 0.1 indicating an inactive solid-like phase.

Figures 11(a) for the β–clip and 11(b) for the β–twist summarize the protein phases that
occur  in  the  space  spanned  by  the  reduced  temperature  T*  and  the  bias  gap  g.  The  qualitative
differences between the phase behavior results for the β–clip and β–twist models and those for
the  β–double-hairpin  model  (Fig.  3)  are  immediately  apparent.  For  examples,  the  native  states
for the β–clip and β–twist models exist at low temperatures for g > 0.5, while for the β–double-
hairpin it exists at low temperatures for g > 0.7. For the β–clip and β–twist models at even low
temperatures, the liquid-to-solid transition exists for all values of g, but for the β–double-hairpin
at  even  low  temperatures  it  exists  only  for  g  <  0.9.  However,  for  all  three  β–sheet  protein
models, although not shown in the figures, a similarity has been found that for g ≥ 0.9 the energy
distribution  for  the  disordered-to-ordered  globule  transition  is  bimodal,  confirming  that  the
transition  is  two-state,  but  the  energy  distribution  for  the  folding  transition  is  not  bimodal,
indicating that the folding transition is continuous.

CONCLUSIONS

We have studied the folding thermodynamics for three different  types of  off-lattice  four-strand
β−sheet  protein  models:  the  β–double-hairpin,  the  β–clip,  and  the  β–twist.  Discontinuous
molecular dynamic simulations of these models  have  been  performed  for  different  sizes  of  the
bias  gap  g,  a  measure  of  the  strength  of  the  native  contacts  relative  to  that  of  the  non-native
contacts. Although all three β−sheet protein models are simple representations for a real protein,
all model proteins have shown a complex set of protein transitions as observed in experimental
studies  (Ptitsyn,  1995).  These  transitions  include  the  collapse  transition,  the  disordered-to-
ordered globule transition, the folding transition, and the liquid-to-solid transition for all values
of the bias gap. A qualitative difference between the present models results and the three-helix
bundle  results  (Zhou  and  Karplus,  1997a,  1997b,  1999)  is  the  existence  of  a  partially-ordered
globule  state,  which  was  not  observed  in  the  three-helix  bundle  protein.  This  partially-ordered

12

globule  state  exists  for  all  three  β−sheet  proteins  at  small  value  of  the  bias  gap  since  the
attraction between non-native contacts disturbs the tendency to order into the native state at low
temperatures.

The bias gap g in the models is clearly seen to be an important factor in controlling the
phase behavior of the model proteins. A strong transition from the disordered globule state to the
ordered globule state with large energy  change and a  weak transition  from the  ordered  globule
state to the native state with small energy change were observed for the larger gap models, g ≥
0.9, while for the smaller gap models, g < 0.7 for the β−double-hairpin and g < 0.5 for the β–clip
and  β–twist,  no  native  structures  were  observed  at  any  temperature.  The  Lindemann  criterion
suggests that the native β−double-hairpin is a liquid-like molten globule, while the native states
of the other two model proteins near the liquid-to-solid transition are surface-molten solids, i.e.
having  an  inactive  solid-like  phase  inside  and  liquid-like  phase  at  the  surface.  The  β−double-
hairpin’s lack  of  a  three-dimensional  core  is  the  major  fact  that  the  native  β−double-hairpin  is
not  a  surface-molten  solid  since  the  interior  beads  in  its  planar  geometry  have  considerable
freedom in their motion causing the liquid-like molten globule and no liquid-to-solid transition.
Further studies on the folding kinetics of the present models and the aggregation of multi-chain
systems are being conducted in order to further our understanding of the complex behaviors of
protein systems.

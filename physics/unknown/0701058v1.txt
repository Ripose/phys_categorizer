Abstract
Author offers conclusions from his research of a revolutionary new idea - transferring electric energy
in the hard vacuum of outer space wirelessly, using a plasma power cord as an electric cable (wire). He
shows that a certain minimal electric currency creates a compressed force that supports the plasma
cable in the compacted form. A large energy can be transferred hundreds of millions of kilometers by
this method. The required mass of the plasma cable is only hundreds of grams. He computed the
macroprojects: transference of hundreds kilowatts of energy to Earth's Space Station, transferring
energy to the Moon or back, transferring energy to a spaceship at distance 100 million of kilometers,
the transfer energy to Mars when one is located at opposed side of the distant Sun, transfer colossal
energy from one of Earth's continents to another continent (for example, between Europe-USA)
wirelessly—using Earth's ionosphere as cable, using Earth as gigantic storage of electric energy, using
the plasma ring as huge MagSail for moving of spaceships. He also demonstrates that electric currency
in a plasma cord can accelerate or brake spacecraft and space apparatus.
Key words: transferring of electricity in space; transfer of electricity to spaceship, Moon, Mars; plasma
MagSail; electricity storage; ionosphere transfer of electricity.

Introduction

The production, storage, and transference of large amounts of electric energy is an enormous

problem for humanity, especially of energy transfer in outer space (vacuum). These spheres of industry
are search for, and badly need revolutionary ideas. If in production of energy, space launch and flight
we have new ideas (see [1]-[16]), it is not revolutionary ideas in transferring and storage energy except
the work [4].
However, if we solve the problem of transferring energy in outer space, then we solve the many
problems of manned and unmanned space flight. For example, spaceships can move long distances by
using efficient electric engines, orbiting satellites can operate unlimited time periods without entry to
Earth's atmosphere, communication satellites can transfer a strong signal directly to customers, the
International Space Station’s users can conduct many practical experiments and the global space
industry can produce new materials. In the future, Moon and Mars outposts can better exploration the
celestial bodies on which they are placed at considerable expense.

Other important Earth mega-problem is efficient transfer of electric energy long distances (intra-
national, international, intercontinental). The consumption of electric energy strongly depends on time
(day or night), weather (hot or cold), from season (summer or winter). But electric station can operate
most efficiently in a permanent base-load generation regime. We need to transfer the energy a far
distance to any region that requires a supply in any given moment or in the special hydro-accumulator
stations. Nowadays, a lot of loss occurs from such energy transformation. One solution for this macro-
problem is to transfer energy from Europe to the USA during nighttime in Europe and from the USA to
Europe when it is night in the USA. Another solution is efficient energy storage, which allows people
the option to save electric energy.

The storage of a big electric energy can help to solve the problem of cheap space launch. The problem
of an acceleration of a spaceship can be solved by use of a new linear electrostatic engine suggested in
[5]. However, the cheap cable space launch offered by author [4] requires use of gigantic energy in
short time period. (It is inevitable for any launch method because we must accelerate big masses to the

2

very high speed - 8 ÷11 km/s). But it is impossible to turn off whole state and connect all electric
station to one customer. The offered electric energy storage can help solving this mega-problem for
humanity.

Offered Innovations and Brief Descriptions
The author offers the series of innovations that may solve the many macro-problems of transportation
energy in space, and the transportation and storage energy within Earth’s biosphere. Below are some of
them.
1)

transfer of electrical energy in outer space using the conductive cord from plasma. Author solved
the main problem - how to keep plasma cord in compressed form. He developed theory of space
electric transference, made computations that show the possibility of realization for these ideas
with existing technology. The electric energy may be transferred in hundreds millions of kilometers
in space (include Moon and Mars).

2) method of construction for space electric lines and electric devices.
3) method of utilization of the plasma cable electric energy.
4) a new very perspective gigantic plasma MagSail for use in outer space as well as a new method for

connection the plasma MagSail to spaceship.

5) a new method of projecting a big electric energy through the Earth's ionosphere.
6) a new method for storage of a big electric energy used Earth as a gigantic spherical condenser.
7) a new propulsion system used longitudinal (cable axis) force of electric currency.

Below are some succinct descriptions of some constructions made possible by these revolutionary
ideas.

1. Transferring electric energy in Space. The electric source (generator, station) is connected to a
space apparatus, space station or other planet by two artificial rare plasma cables (Fig.1a). These cables
can be created by plasma beam [7] sent from the space station or other apparatus.

Fig.1. Long distance plasma transfer electric energy in outer space. a - Parallel plasma transfer, b - Triangle

plasma transfer, c - circle plasma transfer. Notations: 1 - current source (generator), 2 - plasma wire
(cable), 3 - spaceship, orbital station or other energy addresses, 4 - plasma reflector.

The plasma beam may be also made the space apparatus from an ultra-cold plasma [7] when apparatus
starting from the source or a special rocket. The plasma cable is self-supported in cable form by
magnetic field created by electric currency in plasma cable because the magnetic field produces a
magnetic pressure opposed to a gas dynamic plasma pressure (teta-pinch)(Fig. 2). The plasma has a
good conductivity (equal silver and more) and the plasma cable can have a very big cross-section area
(up thousands of square meter). The plasma conductivity does not depend on its density. That way the
plasma cable has a no large resistance although the length of plasma cable is hundreds millions of
kilometers. The needed minimum electric currency from parameters of a plasma cable researched in
theoretical section of this article.

Fig.2. A plasma cable supported by self-magnetic field. Notations: 1 -plasma cable, 2 - compressing magnetic

field, 3 - electric source, 4 - electric receiver, 5 - electric currency, 6 - back plasma line.

The parallel cables having opposed currency repels one from other (Fig.1a). They also can be
separated by a special plasma reflector as it shown in figs. 1b, 2c. The electric cable of the plasma
transfer can be made circular (Fig. 1c). The radial compressed magnetic force from a circle currency
may be balanced a small rotation of the plasma cable (see theoretical section). The circle form is
comfortable for building the big plasma cable lines for spaceship not having equipment for building
own electric lines or before a space launch. We build small circle and gradually increase the diameter
up to requisite value (or up spaceship). The spaceship connects to line in suitable point. Change the
diameter and direction of plasma circle we support the energy of space apparatus. At any time the
spaceship can disconnect from line and circle line can exist without user.

The electric tension (voltage) in a plasma cable is made two nets in issue electric station (electric
generator) [7]-[8]. The author offers two methods for extraction of energy from the electric cable
(Fig.3) by customer (energy addresses). The plasma cable currency has two flows: electrons (negative)
flow and opposed ions (positive) flow in one cable. These flows create an electric current. (It may be
instances when ion flow is stopped and current is transferred only the electron flow as in a solid metal
or by the ions flow as in a liquid electrolyte. It may be the case when electron-ion flow is moved in
same direction but electrons and ions have different speeds). In the first method the two nets create the
opposed electrostatic field in plasma cable (resistance in the electric cable [7]-[8]) (figs.1, 3b). This
apparatus resistance utilizes the electric energy for the spaceship or space station. In the second method
the charged particles are collected a set of thin films (Fig. 3a) and emit (after utilization in apparatus)
back into continued plasma cable (Fig.3a)(see also [7]-[8]).

Fig.3. Getting the plasma currency energy from plasma cable. a - getting by two thin conducting films; b -
getting two nets which brake the electric current flux; c - plasma reflector. Notations: 1 - spaceship or
space station, 2 - set (films) for collect (emit) the charged particles, 3 - plasma cable, 4 - electrostatic nets.

Fig. 3c presents the plasma beam reflector [7]-[8]. That has three charged nets. The first and second
nets reflect (for example) positive particles, the second and third nets reflected the particles having an
opposed charge.

2. Transmitting of the electric energy to satellite, Earth's Space Station, or Moon. The suggested
method can be applied for transferring of electric energy to space satellites and the Moon. For
transmitting energy from Earth we need a space tower of height up 100 km, because the Earth's
atmosphere will wash out the plasma cable or we must spend a lot of energy for plasma support. The
design of solid, inflatable, and kinetic space towers are revealed in [4],[13]-[14],[16].

It is possible this problem may be solved with an air balloon located at 30-45 km altitude and

connected by conventional wire with Earth's electric generator. Further computation can make clear
this possibility.

4

If transferring valid for one occasion only, that can be made as the straight plasma cable 4 (Fig. 4).
For multi-applications the elliptic closed-loop plasma cable 6 is better. For permanent transmission the
Earth must have a minimum two space towers (Fig.4). Many solar panels can be located on Moon and
Moon can transfer energy to Earth.

back) by plasma cable. Notations: 1 - Earth, 2 - Earth's tower 100 km or more, 3 - satellite or Moon, 4 -
plasma cable, 5 - Moon orbit, 6 - plasma cable to Moon, 7 - Moon.

3. Transferring energy to Mars. The offered method may be applied for transferring energy to Mars
including the case when Mars may be located in opposed place of Sun (Fig. 5). The computed
macroproject is in Macroprojects section.

Fig.5. Transferring of electric energy from Earth to Mars located in opposed side of Sun. Notations: 1 - Sun, 2 -

Earth, 3 - Mars, 4 - circle plasma cable.

4. Plasma AB Magnetic Sail. Very interesting idea to build a gigantic plasma circle and use it as a

Magnetic Sail (Fig. 6) harnessing the Solar Wind. The computations show (see section
"Macroproject") that the electric resistance of plasma cable is small and the big magnetic energy of
plasma circle is enough for existence of a working circle in some years without external support. The
connection of spaceship to plasma is also very easy. The space ship create own magnetic field and
attracts to MagSail circle (if spacecraft is located behind the ring) or repels from MagSail circle (if
spaceship located ahead of the ring). The control (turning of plasma circle) is also relatively easy. By
moving the spaceship along the circle plate, we then create the asymmetric force and turning the circle.
This easy method of building the any size plasma circle was discussed above.

5 - magnetic force of spaceship.

5. Wireless transferring of electric energy in Earth. It is interesting the idea of energy transfer from
one Earth continent to another continent without wires. As it is known the resistance of infinity (very
large) conducting medium does not depend from distance. That is widely using in communication. The
sender and receiver are connected by only one wire, the other wire is Earth. The author offers to use
the Earth's ionosphere as the second plasma cable. It is known the Earth has the first ionosphere layer
E at altitude about 100 km (Fig. 7). The concentration of electrons in this layer reaches 5×104 1/cm3 in
daytime and 3.1×103 1/cm3 at night (Fig. 7). This layer can be used as a conducting medium for
transfer electric energy and communication in any point of the Earth. We need minimum two space
100 km. towers (Fig. 8). The cheap optimal inflatable, kinetic, and solid space towers are offered and
researched by author in [4], [6], [7], [16]. Additional innovations are a large inflatable conducting
balloon at the end of the tower and big conducting plates in a sea (ocean) that would dramatically
decrease the contact resistance of the electric system and conducting medium.
Theory and computation of these ideas are presented in Macroprojects section.

3. Electric pressure from the plasma cable. The plasma has pressure in plasma cable. This pressure
is small, but the cable can has a large diameter (up 200 m or more) and this pressure acting a long time
can accelerate or brake the space apparatus. Electric pressure P can be computed by equations

Estimation. For I = 104 A the electric pressure equals 10 N, for I = 105 A one equals 1000 N. In
reality the electric pressure may be significantly more because the kinetic pressure along cable axis
may be more then plasma pressure into plasma cable (see below).
4. Additional power from a space apparatus motion. This power is

W =

where V is apparatus speed, m/s.
Estimation. For V = 11 km/s, I = 103 A, this power equals 550 W, for I = 105 the power equals 55000
W. We spend this power when space apparatus move off from the energy source and receive it when
apparatus approach to the energy station.

Estimation. For electron having n = 105 1/cm3, T = 100 eV, ln (cid:14) (cid:12) 10 we get L = 2×106 km, (cid:20) (cid:12) 300 s.
That means the plasma electrons have very few collusions, small dispersion, and it can have different
average ELECTRON (relative ions) temperature along cable axis and perpendicular cable axis. It is not
surprise because plasma can have different average temperature of electron and ions. That also means
that our assumption about same terminal and currency electron velocities is very limited and
parameters of plasma electric system will many better, then in our computation. The plasma in our
system may be very cooled in radial direction and hot in axial direction. That decreases an electric
currency needed for plasma compression and allows to transfer a plasma beam, energy, and thrust at
long distance.

The transferring electric energy from one continent to other continent through ionosphere and Earth
surface is described over. For this transferring we need two space towers of 100 km height, The towers
must have a big conducting ball at top end and underground (better underwater) plates for decreasing
the contact electric resistance. The contacting ball is large (up to 100 ÷ 200 m diameter) inflatable gas
balloon having the conductivity layer (covering).

into Solar wind, which can be used as a thrust of a space ship. The electric resistance of plasma
MagSail is small and MagSail can exist some years. That is also big good storage of electric energy.

See the estimations in Projects section.

Macroprojects
The macroprojects discussed below are not optimal. These are only examples of estimations: what

parameters of system we can have.
1. Space electric line the length in 100 millions of km.
Let us take the following date of the electric line: radius of plasma cable is r = 150 m, (cross-section
of plasma cable equals S = (cid:11)r2 = 7.06×104 m2), plasma density is n = 1010 1/m3, electric currency is I
= 100 A, electric voltage is U = 2×106 V. Use the equations (1)-(6) we are receiving:

Electron velocity is u = I/enS = 8.85×105 m/s, electron temperature in eV is T = 2.23 eV, electron

temperature in K is Tk = 2.59×104 K, specific electric resistance is (cid:16)= 3×10-4  (cid:13).m, Coulomb
logarithm is ln (cid:14) = 10, charge state is Z = 1, electric resistance is R =2(cid:16)L/S = 8.8×102 (cid:13), loss voltage
is Um = IR = 8.8×104 V, loss power is Wm = IUm = 8.8×106 W, transfer power is W = IU = 2×108 W,
coefficient efficiency is (cid:19)= 0.956 .
As you see, our system can transmit 200 million watts of power at distance 100 million kilometers
with efficiency 95.6%. I remind that the distance to Mars is only about 60 million of kilometers.
Mass of our plasma line from hydrogen H2 is only 470 g.
2. Transferring electric energy to Moon or back.
Let us take the initial data: radius of plasma cable r = 15 m (S = (cid:11)r2 = 706 m2), plasma density n =
1012 1/m3, electric currency I = 1000 A, distance 385,000 km.
Then: u = I/enS = 8.85×106 m/s, T = 223 eV, Tk = 2.59×106 K, (cid:16)= 3.1×10-7 (cid:13).m, ln (cid:14) = 10, Z = 1, R
=2(cid:16)L/S = 3.4×10-1 (cid:13), Um = IR = 3.4×102 V, Wm = IUm = 3.4×105 W.

If voltage is U = 3.4×103 V, then transmitting power is W = IU = 3.4×108 W, coefficient efficiency is

(cid:19)= 0.9.

If U = 3.4×104 V, then W = IU = 34×108 W, (cid:19)= 0.99.
As you see, this system can transmit 340 ÷ 3400 million watts of power to Moon at distance 385,000
kilometers with efficiency 90 ÷ 99%.
If we take electric currency I = 100 A and voltage U = 3.4×103 V, then the transfer energy is W = IU
= 3.4×107 W, (cid:19)= 0.9. The same parameters are transfer energy to Earth's Space Station. Now the
International Space Station has only electric power W = 104 W.
3. Transferring energy to Mars located beyond the in Sun opposed on Earth side. In this case we
use the circle plasma transfer (Fig. 5).
Let us take the following initial data: Radius of circle R = 1.9×1011 m = 190 millions kilometers
(Length of circle equals L (cid:12) 12×1011 m), r = 150 m (S = (cid:11)r2 = 7.06×104 m2), n = 1010 1/m3, I = 100 A,
U = 107 V.
Then: u = I/enS = 8.85×105 m/s, T = 2.23 eV, Tk = 2.59×104 K, (cid:16)= 3.1×10-4 (cid:13).m, ln (cid:14) = 10, Z = 1, R
=(cid:16)L/S = 5.27×103 (cid:13), Um = IR = 5.27×105 V, Wm = IUm = 5.27×107 W, W = IU = 2×108 W, (cid:19)(cid:12) 0.95.

Mass of our plasma line from hydrogen H2 is only about 3 kg.

4. Plasma Magnetic Sail (Fig. 6). Let us take the following initial data: radius of MagSail R =

5×104 m = 50 km, r = 1.5×103 m (S = (cid:11)r2 = 7.06×106 m2), n = 108 1/m3, I = 104 A.
Then: u = I/enS = 8.85×107 m/s, T = 2.23×104 eV, Tk = 2.59×108 K, (cid:16)= 3.1×10-10 (cid:13).m, ln (cid:14) = 10, Z =
1, Rm =(cid:16)L/S = 1.38×10-11 (cid:13), Um = IR = 1.38×10-7 V, Wm = IUm = 1.4×10-3 W.

If U = 100 V, the ring energy is E = 5×106 J [15]. If we spent only 10% of the ring energy, our

MagSail will work about 10 years.
The gigantic plasma space MagSail is also an excellent storige of electric energy. If we take U = 105
V, the ring will keep about E = 5×109 J.

5. Wireless transferring energy between Earth's continents (Fig. 7). Let us take the following

initial data: Gas pressure at altitude 100 km is p = 3.2×10-3 N/m2, temperature is 209 K, diameter
nitrogen N2 molecule is 3.7×10-10 m, the ion/electron density in ionosphere is n = 1010 1/m3, radius of
the conductivity inflatable balloon at top the space tower (mast) is a = 100 m (contact area is S =
1.3×105 m2), specific electric resistance of a sea water is 0.3 (cid:13).m, area of the contact sea plate is
1.3×103 m2.
The computation used equation (15)-(19) give: electron track in ionosphere is L = 1.5 m, electron
velocity (cid:22)= 9×104 m/s, track time (cid:20)= 1.67×10-5 s, specific resistance of ionosphere is (cid:16)= 4.68×10-3 
((cid:13).m)-1, contact resistance of top ball (balloon) is R1 = 0.34 (cid:13), contact resistance of the lower sea
plates is R2 = 4.8×10-3 (cid:13), electric intensity on ball surface is 5×104 V/m.
If the voltage is U = 107 V, total resistance of electric system is R = 100 (cid:13), then electric currency is I
= 105 A, transferring power is W= IU = 1012 W, coefficient efficiency is 99.66%. In practice we are not
limited in transferring any energy in any Earth's point having the 100 km space mast and further
transfer by ground-based electric lines in any geographical region of radius 1000 ÷ 2000 km.
6. Earth's ionosphere as the storage electric energy. It is using the equations (18)-(19) we find the
Earth's-ionosphere capacity C = 4.5×10-2 C. If U = 108 V, the storage energy is E = 0.5CU2 = 2.25×1014
J. That is large energy.

Let us now estimate the leakage of current. Cosmic rays and Earth's radioactivity create 1.5 ÷ 10.4
ions every second in 1 cm3. But they quickly recombine in neutral molecule and the ions concentration
is small. We take the ion concentration of lower atmosphere n = 106 1/m3. Then the specific
conductivity of Earth's atmosphere is 2.1×10-17 ((cid:13).m)-1. The leakage currency is i = 10-7 ×U. The
altitude of E-layer is 100 km. We take a thickness of atmosphere only 10 km. Then the conductivity of
Earth's atmosphere is 10-24 ((cid:13).m)-1 , resistance is Ra = 1024 (cid:13), the leakage time (decreasing of energy
in e = 2.73 times) is 1.5×105 years.
As you can clearly see the Earth's ionosphere may become a gigantic storage site of electricity.

Discussion
The offered ideas and innovations may create a jump in space and energy industries. Author has made
initial base research that conclusively show the big industrial possibilities offered by the methods and
installations proposed. Further research and testing are necessary. As that is in science, the obstacles
can slow, even stop, applications of these revolutionary innovations. For example, the plasma cable
may be unstable. The instability mega-problem of a plasma cable was found in tokomak R&D, but it is
successfully solved at the present time. The same method (rotation of plasma cable) can be applied in
our case.

Summary
This new revolutionary idea - wireless transferring of electric energy in the hard vacuum of outer space
is offered and researched. A rare plasma power cord as electric cable (wire) is used for it. It is shown
that a certain minimal electric currency creates a compressed force that supports the plasma cable in
the compacted form. Large amounts of energy can be transferred hundreds of millions of kilometers by
this method. The requisite mass of plasma cable is merely hundreds of grams. It is computed that the

14

macroprojects: transferring of hundreds of kilowatts of energy to Earth's International Space Station,
transfer energy to Moon or back, transferring energy to a spaceship at distance of hundreds of millions
of kilometers, transfer energy to Mars when it is on the other side of the Sun wirelessly. The transfer
of colossal energy from one continent to another continent (for example, Europe to USA and back),
using the Earth’s ionosphere as a gigantic storage of electric energy, using the plasma ring as huge
MagSail for moving of spaceships. It is also shown that electric currency in plasma cord can accelerate
or slow various kinds of outer space apparatus.

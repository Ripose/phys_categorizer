Detection Technique to Mitigate 
Kerr Effect Phase Noise 

Keang-Po Ho and Joseph M. Kahn  

  
Abstract—Kerr  effect  phase  noise,  often  called  the  Gordon-
Mollenauer  effect,  can  be  compensated  by  subtracting  from  the 
received phase a correction proportional to the received intensity. 
In  this  paper,  we  describe  how  to  perform  this  compensation  in 
the electrical domain, and analytically determine the optimal scale 
factor  for  the  correction.  Using  optimal  compensation,  the 
standard deviation of residual phase noise is halved, doubling the 
transmission  distance  in  systems  limited  by  Kerr  effect  phase 
noise.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

G

ORDON  and  Mollenauer  [1]  showed  that  when  optical 
amplifiers  are  used  to  compensate  for  fiber  loss,  the 
interaction of amplifier noise and the Kerr effect causes phase 
noise,  even  in  systems  using  constant-intensity  modulation. 
This  Kerr  effect  phase  noise,  also  called  the  Gordon-
Mollenauer  effect,  corrupts  the  received  phase  and  limits 
transmission  distance  in  systems  using  phase-shift  keying 
(PSK) or differential phase-shift keying (DPSK). These classes 
of  constant-intensity  modulation  techniques  have  received 
renewed  attention  recently  for  long-haul  and/or  spectrally 
efficient  WDM  applications  [2]-[4].  Recently,  the  received 
intensity is used to compensate the Kerr effect phase noise [5]-
[6].  Previous  compensation  methods  have  used  a  nonlinear 
optical component [5] or a phase modulator [6]. In this letter, 
we describe how to perform the compensation using electronic 
circuits.  We  derive  the  optimal  correction  factor  for  this 
electronic  compensation,  which  can  also  be  applied  to 
optimize  the  methods  of  [5]-[6].  The  optimal  compensation 
can  halve  the  standard  deviation  (STD)  of  Kerr  effect  phase 
noise,  doubling  the  transmission  distance  in  systems  whose 
dominant impairment is Kerr effect phase noise. 

II.  CORRECTION OF KERR EFFECT PHASE NOISE 

We  consider  a  system  with  many  fiber  spans  using  an 
optical amplifier in each span to compensate for fiber loss. For 
simplicity, we assume that each span is of the same length, and

that  an  identical  optical  power  is  launched  into  each  span.  In 
the linear propagation regime, the electric field launched in the 
kth  span  is  equal  to  Ek  =  E0  +  n1  +  n2  +  …  +  nk,  k  =  1...N,

loss  of  the  last  span  and  the  amplifier  gain  required  to 
compensate it, the signal received after N spans is EN = E0 + n1

where g  is the nonlinear coefficient of the fiber, and Leff is the 
effective  nonlinear  length  per  fiber  span.  In  the  presence  of 
Kerr  effect  phase  noise,  the  received  electric  field  is  ER  = 
ENexp(-jf NL).  In  PSK  systems,  an  optical  phase-locked  loop 
(PLL)  [7]  can  be  used  to  receive  the  in-phase and quadrature 
components  of  the  received  electrical  field  ER.  In  DPSK 
systems,  a  pair  of  interferometers  [3]  can  be  used  to  obtain 
both  in-phase  and  quadrature  differential  components  of  the 
received electrical field ER. 

Fig.  1  shows  the  simulated  distribution  of  the  received 
electric field ER, detected by an optical PLL (e.g., see Fig. 5 of 
[7]),  in  a  BPSK  system  with  N  =  32  spans.  The  received

optical  signal-to-noise  ratio  (OSNR)  is 
  =  18, 
corresponding  to  a  bit-error  rate  (BER)  of  10- 9  in  the  linear 
regime. In Fig. 1a, the mean nonlinear phase is <f NL> = 1 rad, 
corresponding  to  the  maximum  mean  nonlinear  phase  shift 
estimated  in  [1].    Fig.  1b  illustrates  the  case  <f NL>  =  2  rad. 
The  helical-shaped  distributions  in  Figs.  1  arise  because  the 
nonlinear  phase  rotation  is  correlated  with  the  received 
intensity  [5]-[6].  Figs.  1  also  show  spiral  curves  that  separate 
the  plane  into  two  decision  regions.  These  decision  regions 
resemble  the  Yin-Yang  logo  of  Chinese  mysticism,  and  are 
called the “Yin-Yang detector” below. The Yin-Yang detector 
uses  strictly  electronic  techniques  to  compensate  Kerr  effect 
phase noise, and hence, it differs significantly from the optical 
[5] and electro-optical [6] compensation techniques considered 
previously.

corrected phase estimate is f R -

To our knowledge, the optimal scale factor (2) and variance 
of residual phase noise (3) have been derived here for the first 
time.  While  [8]  considered  a  more  complicated  system,  the 
simple approximation in (4) may yield more useful insight. We 
should  note  that  in  [6],  simulation  was  used  to  optimize  the 
scale factor, yielding a result similar to (2). 

Figs.  2  show  the  distribution  of  the  corrected  signal  Ec  = 
ERexp(-ja PN),  assuming  the  same  parameters  as  Figs.  1.  The 
distributions  shown  in  Figs.  2  have  been  rotated  by  the  mean 
phase  <f NL  +  a PN>,  so  that  the  decision  regions  become  the 
right and left half-planes. Comparing Figs. 1 to Figs. 2, we see 
that the phase correction has dramatically reduced the STD of 
the  nonlinear  phase  shift.  Note  that,  ignoring  a  rotation,  the 
phase distribution in Fig. 2b is similar to that in Fig. 1a. 

 Decoding the corrected electric field Ec using the right and 

left half-planes in Figs. 2 is equivalent to decoding the

phase noise-limited transmission distance is limited to a value 
such  that  the  mean  nonlinear  phase  shift  is  <f NL>  =  1  rad. 
From  Fig.  3  and  (6),  this  corresponds  to  a  STD  of 
 

0.1925 rad. Because a mean phase conveys neither information 
nor  noise,  while  the  STD  of  phase 
  is  an  indicator  of

system impairment, we can restate the condition for maximum 
transmission  distance  in  terms  of  STD  of  phase  as

the  same  value, 

0.1925  rad.  Using  our  phase  correction  scheme  (or  the  Yin-
Yang  detector)  and  allowing  the  STD  of  corrected  phase  to 
take  on 
i.e., 
=  0.1925  rad, 
corresponds to a mean nonlinear phase shift of  <f NL> = 2 rad.  
Because  the  mean  nonlinear  phase  shift  is  proportional  to  the 
number  of  fiber  spans  as  shown  in  (5),  doubling  the  mean 
nonlinear  phase  shift  doubles  the  number  of  fiber  spans,  and 
thus doubles the transmission distance, assuming that the Kerr 
effect phase noise is the primary limitation.

While  the  foregoing  discussion  has  focused  on  BPSK,  the 
use of DPSK has generated much more interest recently [2-7]. 
In a DPSK system, information is encoded in phase differences 
between  successive  symbols,  and  is  decoded  using  the 
differential  phase  f R(t+T)  -
  f R(t),  where  T  is  the  symbol 
interval.  When  the  differential  phase  is  corrupted  by  the 
nonlinear phase shift difference f NL(t+T) -
 f NL(t),  the impact 
of  Kerr  effect  phase  noise  can  be  compensated  by  decoding  
f R(t+T) -
 PN(t) is 
the power difference between successive symbols. The optimal 
scale  factor  for  DPSK  systems  is  precisely  analogous  to  that 
for  BPSK  systems,  and  also  approximately  doubles  the 
transmission distance.

In  a  practical  system,  phase-sensitive  detection  may  yield 
the quadrature components, e.g., cos(f R) and sin(f R) in a PSK 
system [3][7]. Instead of correcting the phase by f R -
 a PN, the 
corrected  quadrature  components  can  be  calculated,  e.g.,  as 
cos(f R - a PN) = sin(f R)sin(a PN) + cos(f R)cos(a PN) and sin(f R 
  a PN)  =  sin(f R)cos(a PN)  -  cos(f R)sin(a PN),  using  electronic 
signal processing techniques. 

Other  types  of  nonlinear  phenomena  may  also  limit  the 
transmission distance in WDM systems. The interaction of the 
Kerr  effect  and  optical  amplifier  noise  also  induces  intensity 
noise [9], which we have ignored in this letter.  Like [1], [5]-
[6], this letter also ignores all dispersion and filtering effects. 

IV.  CONCLUSION 

In systems using BPSK or DPSK, the impact of Kerr effect 
phase  noise  can  be  reduced  by  using  electronic  circuits  to 
implement  the  Yin-Yang  decision  regions  shown  in  Figs.  1. 
Equivalently,  the  received  phase  can  be  compensated  as 
described above, in which case the receiver should employ the 
half-plane  decision 
in  Figs.  2.  This 
regions  shown 
compensation  halves  the  STD  of  the  residual  nonlinear  phase 
shift,  permitting  a  doubling  of  the  number  of  fiber  spans  and 
the  transmission  distance,  assuming  that  Kerr  effect  phase 
noise is the dominant system impairment.

Abstract

The phenomenon of ball lightning has been observed for a long time, but the 

nature of these luminous balls has been unknown.  It is proposed here that they consist 

of highly excited Rydberg atoms with large polarizabilities that bind them together.  

Thus the cohesion of the balls comes from photon exchange forces (London dispersion 

forces) rather than the more usual electron exchange (chemical) forces.  The cohesion 

in plasmas generated at the back faces of detonating explosives has a similar basis.

Estimates are given to justify this interpretation. 

For centuries, luminous plasma spheres have been observed during thunder

storms in addition to linear lightning discharges.  The literature regarding these

“lightning balls" has been extensively reviewed in a recent special issue of the

Transactions of the Royal Society of London (2002), and an extensive review of their

characteristics was published about a decade ago (Turner, 1994).  However, no

convincing model of the structure, and properties, of these remarkable spheres has

emerged from this review.   In particular, their considerable cohesion is not explained,

although numerous proposals have been made.

Cohesive plasmas have also been observed in association with the detonation of

explosives.  Highly luminous "plasma-discs" have been photographed emerging from 

-2-

the back surfaces (the side opposite the initiator) of detonating explosives.  First

observed by Cook (1958), they were later observed by others: Davis and Campbell

(1960); Fortov, Musyankov, Yakushev, and Dremin (1974); and Zernow (2001).  These

authors found that the plasmas persist long enough to travel in air for a few meters (of

order microseconds).  The lifetimes of lightning balls may be much longer; 10-100

seconds (Turner, 1994, p.96).  Laboratory microwave plasmas persist for 200 ms.

(Brandenburg and Kline, 1998).

Cook also observed that the plasmas have enough cohesion to turn sharp

corners (180 deg.) when guided by glass tubing; indicating that the plasma has little 

shear stiffness.  Later, Zernow (2001) observed that when the plasmas created by 

explosives struck aluminum witness plates they gave up enough energy to melt the

surface.  This effect verfies their approximate densities. But it probably has more to do

with the kinetic energies of the total number of high speed particles than with the

recombination energies of the ions.  Cook (1958) and his colleagues proposed that the

explosives generated plasmas are analogous to dense metallic “glasses”, but Fortov,

Musyankov, Yakushev, and Dremin (1974) proved that the plasmas induced by

explosives are of relatively low density (about 10X the density of air); so they cannot be

Related plasma "balls" (clouds of excitons) in Ge crystals have also been excited

by irradiating the crystals with intense coherent light (Kittel, 1996).  In this case the

binding energies of the excitons are about 2 meV, and the concentation is about 2 X

metallic.

An important clue to the cohesion of these various plasmas is their luminosity.  

This indicates that the particles within them are in excited Rydberg states.  Ordinary

excitations would not be expected to yield substantial cohesion, but the van der Waals

(and Casimir) forces between the atoms and molecules increase with the squares of

their polarizabilities.  The latter, in turn, increase with squares of the principal quantum

numbers of the excited states.  This is because the polarizability is proportional to the

volume of an excited species (whose radius is determined approximately by the square

of the principal quantum number).  Rydberg atoms with principal quantum numbers as

high as n (cid:46) 1100 have been observed in laboratory experiments (Dunning, 1995).  

Large polarizabilities have also been measured (van Wijngaarden, 1999). 

The mass densities of the plasmas in question are relatively small as indicated

by their translucence, and by the direct measurements of Fortov et al. (1974).  Their

 ionization fractions are about 10%.  Therefore, the point particle-particle Coulombic

cohesion in them is negligible.  It is the London dipole-dipole interactions between the

Rydberg atoms that yield significant cohesion.  This consists of two principal terms: one

is a repulsive overlap term; and the other an attractive  dipole-dipole term (both are

induced dipoles).  These terms differ in range, and when averaged over a plasma 

sphere yield net cohesion.  This may be thought of as Lennard-Jones cohesion since all

of the interaction forces are positive, and of long range.  

The observed diameters of ball lightning spheres are summarized by Bychkov, 

Bychkov, and Abrahamson (2002).  They range from 0.02 to 1.5 m. with an average of 

0.25 m.  Take 0.2 m. as typical, or a radius of 10 cm.  This corresponds to the 

-4-

maximum possible Rydberg orbital, rR which is given approximately by the Bohr

expression (Gallagher, 1994):

rR = (n2(cid:163)2) / (Zq2m) = 053 x 10-8 cm.      (for n = Z = 1)                              (1)

so for air with Z (nitrogen) (cid:46) 7; q = electron charge; m = electron mass; (cid:163) = Planck's

constant / 2(cid:66); and rR (max.) = 10 cm.; this expression yields n (cid:46) 104.  But the average 

value of n2 is n2 /3, so the average rR is about 3 cm.  At this radius the binding energy

of an electron to its positive ion is very small, but the polarizabilty, (cid:34) (cid:46) 4(cid:66)rR

3/3 of the 

average Rydberg atom is very large.  It is about 40(cid:66) cm3 which is about 1025 times

larger than that of an individual nitrogen atom in its ground state.  The corresponding 

interaction energy between two such Rydberg atoms (with (cid:34) = polarizability, I = 

ionization energy = -q2 / 2rR , and d = distance between them) is about:

u =  - [(3/4)(cid:34)2I] / (cid:44)p d6

(2)

where q is an electron’s charge (Israelachvili, 1991).

The interaction between any two Rydberg atoms immersed in a plasma ball is

screened by the polarizabilities of the other atoms.  Therefore, it is expected that the

average interaction energy will be reduced by the effective dielectric constant, (cid:44)p of the

plasma (where (cid:34) is the average polarizability):

(cid:44)p = 1 + 4(cid:66)N(cid:34) (cid:46) 14

(3)

since N(cid:34) (cid:46) 1

Densities of Lightning Balls

Since lightning balls are observed to travel horizontally for considerable

distances, and they are translucent, their densities must be comparable with that of air; 

-5-

namely, about 1.185 x 10-3 g/cc. at 25°C.  A typical volume per ball is 4.19 x 103  cc. (10 

cm. radius), so the weight is 4.96 g.  Assuming air to be 20% oxygen, and 80% 

nitrogen, there are about 0.17 mols / ball.; hence, 2.08 x 1023 particles / ball.  This yields 

an average inter-particle spacing of about 27 (cid:68).  The ion density is less than the particle

density, of course (Anderson, 1981)

To get an upper limit for the cohesive energy, since the dipole-dipole interaction

energy always has the same sign, the pair energies (given by Equation (2)) can simply

be added up.  The degree of ionization in lightning balls is not known, but in the plasma

disks generated by explosives Fortov et alia (1974) measured it to be about 10%.  Since 

the luminosity in the two cases is about the same, it will be assumed that the degree of 

ionization is the same.   This is only a guess with a weak basis, but it yields an ion

density of about 1.12 x 10-4 g / cc.  With the average molecular weight of air being 29 g / 

mol., the particle density is 2.3 x 1018 ions / cc., so the average distance between ions

is75 (cid:68).  This means that the average polarizability is about 5.3 x 10-20 cc.  The ionization

energy of nitrogen is 15.6 eV (one eV = 1.6 x 10-12 erg.),         

Substituting these numbers into Equation (2):

u = 0.014 eV

which is roughly 1% of the cohesive energy per atom in a metal, and therefore

reasonable.

The shear modulus, G, an indicator of resistance to shear deformation, can be

estimated by comparing the deformation of a plasma ball caused by an external electric

field (polarizability = (cid:34)) with that caused by mechanical strain.  The resulting relation is:

-6-

G = [3/4(cid:66)][q2 / (cid:34)d]

(4)

where d is the average spacing between ions and electrons, q = electron’s charge = 4.8

x 10-10 esu. (Gilman, 1997).  This gives G = 1.4 atm. Which is consistent with the

deformability of the lightning balls.  They have been reported to pass through openings

smaller than themselves (Turner. 1994)

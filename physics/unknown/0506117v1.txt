We  demonstrate  in  numerical  experiments that estimators of strength and directionality of cou-

pling  between  oscillators  based  on  modeling  of  their  phase  dynamics  [D.A.  Smirnov  and  B.P.  Bez-

ruchko, Phys. Rev. E 68, 046209 (2003)] are widely applicable. Namely, although the expressions for 

the estimators and their confidence bands are derived for linear uncoupled oscillators under the influ-

ence of independent sources of Gaussian white noise, they turn out to allow reliable characterization 

of coupling from relatively short time series for different properties of noise, significant phase nonlin-

earity  of  the  oscillators,  and  non-vanishing  coupling  between  them.  We apply the estimators to ana-

lyze a two-channel human intracranial epileptic electroencephalogram (EEG) recording with the pur-

pose of epileptic focus localization.

An interdisciplinary problem of detecting interaction between oscillatory systems solely 

from their time realizations has attracted attention of researchers for a long time. Several ap-

proaches to its solution have been suggested within the framework of linear time series analy-

sis and information theory. The most well-known of them are cross-correlation function, co-

herence function, and mutual information function, which are typically capable of detecting 

only the presence of interdependence. To detect coupling directionality, their generalizations 
exist,  such  as  Granger  causality2,  Geweke’s  spectra3,  and  similar  information-theoretic  con-
cepts4,5. Recently, there have been developed new approaches in nonlinear dynamics to reveal 

the  presence  of  nonlinear  interaction  and  its  directionality.  These  nonlinear  techniques  are 
based either on analysis in state spaces6-13 or investigation of phase dynamics14-20. The latter 

set of approaches includes an evolution map approach, based on modeling phase dynamics of

the systems17,18, and its extension for the case of relatively short time series1. The latter tech-

nique is shown to be often more sensitive to weak coupling than state space approaches, espe-
cially for the practically important case of short signals21. In addition, expressions for the con-

fidence  bands  have  been  developed  for  the  coupling  estimators  of  Ref.  1  that  increases 

reliability of  the results.  But all the formulas are rigorously valid only for weakly nonlinear 

and weakly coupled phase oscillators under the influence of independent sources of Gaussian 

white noise. In the present paper, we investigate practical limits of applicability of these for-

mulas and show in numerical experiments that they are quite wide. Finally, application of the 

estimators to an intracranial EEG recording from an epileptic patient is presented. 

 

1. INTRODUCTION 

Characterization of  coupling  between two oscillatory systems from their time series is an im-
portant task in different fields of scientific research and practice, including climatology22, electron-
ics23, and physiology24. Thus, a great deal of attention is paid nowadays to investigation of interac-
tion  between  human  cardio-vascular  and  respiratory  systems16,18,19,25-28  and  to  analysis  of  mul-
tichannel  EEG  and  MEG  recordings9-13,15,29-35,  in  particular,  with the purpose to localize epileptic 
foci9,15,29,30,32,34.  Most  of  the  well-known  approaches, such as cross-spectral analysis and informa-

tion-theoretic characteristics, are often insufficient to detect directional coupling from complex real-

world signals. In the last years, new promising techniques are suggested by nonlinear dynamics, see 

comparative study of several approaches in Refs. 21 and 31. 

One  family  of  nonlinear  approaches  exploits  the  idea  to  analyze  interdependencies  between 

phases of the oscillatory systems. The most sensitive approach within this family involves construc-

tion  of  an  empiric  model  for  the  phase  dynamics  and  calculation  of  interaction  strength  from  the 

values of its parameters. The idea is suggested originally in Ref. 17 and the technique to realize it is 

called (cid:147)evolution map approach(cid:148) (EMA). It is efficient for analysis of oscillatory processes unsyn-

chronized  with  each  other  and  exhibiting  pronounced  main  rhythms  of  oscillations  that  allows  to 

introduce  well-defined  phases.  In  its  initial  version,  EMA  provides  reliable  results  for  stationary 

time series of quite a considerable length, such as 5000 characteristic periods under moderate noise 
levels. A very similar approach is proposed by Kiemel et al14,20. 

However,  in  practice  one  often  encounters  nonstationary  signals,  e.g.,  EEG  recordings  are 
well-known to be highly nonstationary36. Thus, the problem of coupling characterization from short 

time series segments inevitably arises. To address it, special corrections have been introduced into 

formulas for the EMA coupling estimators, so that the latter become unbiased even in the case of 

2
 

 

 

relatively short time series (down to 50 basic periods), and expressions for their confidence bands 

have been derived in Ref. 1. The modified expressions for the coupling estimators are derived under 

the assumptions of linear uncoupled phase oscillators influenced by independent sources of Gaus-

sian  white  noise.  Their  applicability  in  other  cases  has  neither  been  rigorously  proven,  nor  thor-

oughly investigated experimentally. Our purpose here consists in a systematical investigation of the 

limits of applicability of the modified EMA estimators. Relevance and applied importance of such a 

work is justified by a variety of situations, where one needs to detect weak coupling from short time 

series  and  the  modified  EMA  appears  very  sensitive  and  reliable.  Yet,  under  some  conditions  its 

efficiency deteriorates, so that other techniques can be more effective as discussed in Sec. 4. 

The paper is organized as follows. We describe the modified EMA in Sec. 2.1 and a technique 

to find out limits of its applicability in Sec. 2.2. Results of investigation are reported in Sec. 3 where 

we show the influence of noise properties (Sec.3.1), individual nonlinearity of oscillators (Sec.3.2), 

coupling  intensity  (Sec.3.3),  several  factors  together  including  the  case  of  common  source  of  the 

noise  (Sec.3.4),  and  illustrate  an  application  of  the  method  with  analysis  of  an  epileptic  EEG  re-

cording (Sec.3.5). Discussion of the relationships between the modified EMA and other approaches 

and summary of our results is presented in Sec.4. Too cumbersome formulas for the coupling esti-

mators are given in Appendix. 

 

2. METHODS 

2.1. Modified evolution map approach 

The main idea of the original method is to estimate how strongly future evolution of the phase 

of one system depends on the current value of the phase of the other system. To achieve this, one 
obtains time series of the oscillations(cid:146) phases {

interval.  An  analytic  signal  is  constructed  for  this  purpose  typically  in  one  of  the  two  ways.  The 

most traditional one is to calculate Hilbert transform

 of the observed signal

proach, sampling frequency for the original time series is desirable to be not less than 20 points per 
basic period to extract the phase without significant distortions16,40. 

After  calculation  of  the  phases, one constructs a mathematical model from their time realiza-

tions. Model structure is chosen based on the following considerations. In variety of situations, the 

phase dynamics of oscillators exhibiting a pronounced main rhythm are adequately described with 
stochastic differential equations of the form41

from the model coefficients as explained below.  

If the (cid:147)true(cid:148) equations for phase dynamics were known a priori, then the intensity  1с  of the in-
fluence of the second system on the first one (2→1) would be defined as the steepness of the de-
φ ), and everything is the same for the intensity  2с  of the influence 1→2:

Directionality index is determined by the difference between  1с  and 

2с . It would be true coupling 

characteristics. However, one has only estimates of the coefficients 

ia(cid:136)  obtained from a time series 

and needs to calculate estimates of  1с  and 

2с  based on 

ia(cid:136) . The most direct way is to use Eq. (5) 

substituting the estimates 

ia(cid:136)  for the true values 

ia . But such estimators 

2,1(cid:136)c

 appear (cid:147)good(cid:148) only for 

very long stationary signals whose length should be about 5000 basic periods for the sampling fre-
quency 10-20 points per a basic period and moderate noise level1,17,23. For shorter time series often 

encountered in practice, these estimators turn out to be biased. The modified estimators

Gaussian  white  noise,  these  modified  estimators  are  unbiased  and  provide  the  rate  of  erroneous 

conclusions about coupling presence and directionality less than 5 % for time series whose length 

may be as small as 50 basic periods. 

2.2. Technique for investigation of applicability limits in numerical experiments 

Expressions  for  the  estimators 

2,1(cid:136)γ   and  δ(cid:136)   are  derived  analytically  for  the  system  (3)  with

, their ACFs are linearly decreasing 

from  τσ2

  down  to  zero  over  the  interval  [0,τ] .  If  one of the mentioned properties of the system 

i

(Gaussianity and independence of 

ε , forms of their ACFs, linearity of oscillators, absence of cou-
i

pling) is violated, then the estimators 

2,1(cid:136)γ  and  δ(cid:136)  may become biased and the expressions for their 

confidence bands may no longer correspond to 95% reliability. 

In this work, we vary different properties of oscillators and find out where the estimators

2,1(cid:136)γ  

and δ(cid:136)  are still reliable. To accomplish this, we aim at answering the following questions:  

•  (cid:147)under what conditions the estimators 

2,1(cid:136)γ  remain unbiased?(cid:148); 

•  (cid:147)under  what  conditions  the  probability  of  erroneous  conclusions  about  coupling  presence  and 

directionality remains less than 5 % ?(cid:148); 

• 

since one may also obtain indefinite conclusions about coupling character, i.e. that it is impossi-

5
 

 

 

ble to detect coupling presence or directionality with confidence, an important question is (cid:147)un-

der  what  conditions  the  probability  of  correct  conclusions  about  coupling  presence  and  direc-

tionality is high?(cid:148). To be concrete, we determine when this probability is greater than 75 %. 

To answer the first question we calculate biases of estimators

To answer the second (third) question, we count the number of erroneous (correct) conclusions

whether it is less than 5 % (greater than 75 %).  

If  not  stated  otherwise,  time  series  of  phases  in  numerical  experiments  are  of  the  length  N  =

where  angle  brackets  stand  for  the  time  average,  which  quantifies  the  degree  of  synchrony  in  the

warning can be generated, at least sometimes, if  ρ>0.6 as observed in Ref. 23. 

3. RESULTS 

3.1. Influence of noise properties

and their ACFs are linearly decreasing down to zero over the interval [

2,1(cid:136)γ  and  δ(cid:136)  are rigorously applicable if the noise terms 
]τ,0

ε  in (6) are Gaussian 
2,1

. To check to what extent 

these conditions are necessary, we apply the method to estimate coupling from time realizations of 

the system (6) with different properties of 

ε . In the following, we fix

. A noise realization for a necessary value of T is generated with the aid of moving 

average filter applied to the sequence of i.i.d. Gaussian random values. Sampling interval is taken to 

be

As a result of calculations, we found that for all T and σ, the number of erroneous conclusions 

about coupling presence does not exceed 4 % and the estimators 

2,1(cid:136)γ  and  δ(cid:136)  remain unbiased. E.g.,

Different  probability  distributions.  Next,  we  consider  noises

 just as the sequence of i.i.d. random values42. We consider the following PDFs:  

•  unsmooth PDF (cid:150) uniform distribution on a finite interval;

asymmetric PDF (cid:150) demeaned chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom;  

•  bimodal  PDF  (cid:150)  random  alternation  of  values  drawn  from  two  Gaussian  distributions  with  the 

same variance and different expectations. 

Noise  intensities

same for all PDFs and noise levels. Namely, the estimators are unbiased and the number of errone-

ous  conclusions  about  coupling  presence  is  less  than  5  %.  E.g.,  for  the  uniform  distribution  with

form of the PDFs does not seem to affect applicability of the estimators also. 

This  result  can  be  understood  intuitively  based  on  the  robust  estimation  ideas43.  It  is  known 

from the linear regression theory that ordinary least-squares estimators of the regression coefficients 

are statistically efficient in the case of independent normally distributed observation errors. Varia-

tion of the distribution in a wide class (all distributions with variance less than a certain finite value) 

does not change significantly the accuracy of the estimators. Non-zero correlations between the ob-

 

7
 

 

 

servation errors often do not affect it also. In our case, the estimators 

2,1(cid:136)γ  and  δ(cid:136)  are based on the 

least-squares estimators of the model coefficients, so the robustness of the latter could carry over to 

2,1(cid:136)γ  and  δ(cid:136) . A more serious problem arises if the distributions of

ased and the probability of erroneous conclusion about coupling presence is less than 5 % in the re-

gion to the left from the solid line, i.e. up to sufficiently strong nonlinearity b = 0.3-0.7. The values 
of mean phase coherence ρ are shown in Fig. 1 (b) with grayscale, ρ increases with nonlinearity to 

some  extent  since  distribution  of  the  wrapped  phase  difference 

φφ −   on  the  interval  [0,2π]  be-

comes less uniform. However, ρ is relatively small even to the right from the solid line in Fig. 1 (a) 
where  1(cid:136)γ  is biased or error probability is high, so ρ cannot reliably detect such situations here. 

Let us express the result in (cid:147)physical(cid:148) units, i.e. considering contributions of the nonlinear term

 and noise term  1

latter can be interpreted as the influence of the linear component of the restoring force of the first 

oscillator. We express the relative value of nonlinearity as

. In the new relative units, the numerical values along the hori-

zontal axes in Fig. 1 remain practically unchanged, while the values along the vertical axes decrease 

approximately 2.5 times. We conclude that the coupling estimators are unbiased and probability of 

erroneous conclusion about coupling presence is less than 5 % for noise intensity in the range 0-25 

% of the linear component of the restoring force and phase nonlinearity strength up to 30-70%.

Thus,  the  domain  of  the  estimators(cid:146)  applicability appears quite significant with respect to the 

nonlinearity strength for all three cases considered, different nonlinearities manifesting themselves 

in a very similar manner. In other words, linearity of the oscillators is not a necessary condition for 

the estimators(cid:146) applicability and can be moderately violated. 

To check to what extent the estimators 

2,1(cid:136)γ  and  δ(cid:136)  are applicable when considerable coupling 

between  oscillators  is  present,  we  calculate  them  from  time  realizations  of  the  system  (3)  with

2,1(cid:136)γ   are  unbiased  (this  condition  determines  the  right  boundary  which  is  close  to  vertical  straight 

line) and the number of correct conclusions about coupling strength is greater than 75% (this condi-

tion determines the curved left boundary which makes sense as a minimal reliably identifiable cou-

pling strength for a given noise level). The estimators are erroneous if 

8.0>ρ

, see Fig. 3 (а). So, 

the (cid:147)rule of thumb(cid:148) that ρ close to 0.6 is a sign of danger23 for application of the EMA seems to be 

roughly confirmed here. 

The causes of bias in the estimates in the case of large k are following: (i) synchronization for 

low  noise  levels  [Fig.  3  (а)],  (ii)  nonlinearity  of  the  phase  dynamics  induced  by  the  presence  of 

coupling for high noise levels. At a given noise level, the best situation is an intermediate strength 

of unidirectional coupling, since at weak coupling the probability of correct conclusion is low due 

to  noise  and  at  strong  coupling  the  estimates  become  biased  due  to  synchronization  or  just  phase 

nonlinearity.  Domain  of  the  estimators(cid:146)  applicability  widens  with  the  time  series  length  at  fixed 

sampling frequency, see a big region in Fig. 3 (b) for time series length N = 4000. Note that right 

boundary is not a vertical line any more: for higher noise level stronger coupling is acceptable since 

intensive noise prevents synchronization that is good for the modified EMA application. For shorter 

time series strong noise is not so useful [almost vertical right boundary for N = 1000, Fig. 3 (a) and 

(b)] because there is no enough data to reliably extract information about coupling. If the time series 

length is increased only due to increase in sampling frequency, the results almost do not change, see 

the dashed line in Fig. 3 (b). The reason is that new data points sampled from the same time interval 

are highly correlated with the data already present, so that the former provide almost no new infor-

 
10

 

 

mation about the dynamics. Thus, it is not reasonable to aim at a very high sampling frequency, it is 
enough to use a frequency sufficient for reliable phase extraction (20 data points per basic period16).

In relative units (

pling strength up to 20% of the linear restoring force. Coupling strength of 20% can be identified 

reliably  from  a  time  series  of  the  length  N  =  1000  for  noise  intensity  up  to  20%.  Arbitrary  weak 

coupling can be detected reliably if noise level is sufficiently low: the left boundary in Fig. 3 (a) is 

an almost straight line

 for weak couplings.

The results of calculations are shown in Fig. 5. The region of the coupling estimators efficiency 
is bounded on the right (i.e. for large coupling strength). ρ reaches a value of 0.8 within this region. 

Again,  there  are  two  causes  that  limit  the  estimators(cid:146)  applicability.  For  low  noise  level,  there  is 

mainly  an  increase  in  oscillations(cid:146)  synchrony,  which  induces  biases  in  the  estimators.  For  high 

noise level, there is a significant scattering of the estimates(cid:146) values, which induces small probability 

of correct conclusions about coupling character. 

In  relative  units  (k/ω2  and 

σ

2/ πω
2

)  the  limits  of  applicability  are  up  to  8%  for  coupling 

strength at noise level up to 2% and up to 2 % for coupling strength at noise level about 5%. Noise 

level of 5 % is the greatest allowable one. Thus, for bidirectional coupling the method also works 

properly for significant intervals of coupling strength and noise intensity values. But the region of 

applicability  is  narrower  than  that  presented  in  Fig.3  (a)  since  asymmetry  in  coupling  is  small. 

Bounds  of  the  region  of  applicability  move  apart  with  increase  in  coupling  asymmetry  and  fixed 

overall coupling strength. So, the case of unidirectional coupling considered above is the easiest one 

for the determination of coupling directionality.

More realistic is a situation where one observes not phases directly but rather some variables  

from  which  one  needs  to  calculate  phases  and,  hence,  may  introduce  some  additional  errors.  To 

simulate such a situation, first, we take coupled van der Pol oscillators as an object:

. We take the variables 

1, xx

2

 as observables, both the case of absence and presence of ob-

servational noise are considered. The signals are quasi-harmonic for moderate noise levels consid-

ered here, so the phases of oscillations are readily calculated with the aid of Hilbert transform even 

without filtering. Sampling interval is 

π1.0=∆t

 that corresponds to 20 data points per basic period. 

Original time series length is N = 1400. After calculation of phases, we discard 200 values at each 
edge to avoid edge effects16. So, the resulting time series of each phase comprises 1000 data points, 

i.e. 50 basic periods. The oscillators possess individual phase nonlinearity. Noise in the phase dy-

namics equations is not precisely Gaussian and white. So, this object represents simultaneous viola-

tion  of  several  conditions  for  the  estimators  applicability.  We  consider  unidirectional  coupling:

presence is greater than 75 % (left boundary). ρ reaches approximately 0.7 within the region, again 

in good agreement with the rule that 

 is dangerous for the method application. The bounda-

ries are almost straight lines. As usually, ρ becomes greater to the right from this region and estima-

tors become biased due to significant  of oscillations. Left boundary is determined by low probabil-

ity of correct conclusions due to noise. The results are quite analogous to Fig. 3 (a) in Sec.3.3. In 

relative  units,  we  express  contributions  of  coupling  and  noise  to  the  phase  dynamics  as

 at weak coupling, we obtain relative contributions of coupling and noise approximately 

equal to

for the phase oscillators, Fig. 2 (a)] and up to 17 % for noise level (approximately the same as for 

the phase oscillators).

with independent dynamical noise sources, an analogue to Fig. 6 (a). 

Common dynamical noise, observational noise is absent. Next, we analyze what changes if dy-

namical noise is the same for both oscillators. This case deserves a special attention since common 

driving  (even  stochastic  one)  can  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  degree  of  synchrony between the two 

oscillators.  This  is  undesirable  for  application  of  the  coupling  estimators  analyzed  here,  see,  e.g., 

 
14

 

 

Ref. 23. But the results of numerical experiments [Fig. 6 (b)] are surprisingly almost indistinguish-

able from the case of independent noises. So, at least for the range of parameters considered here, 

common noise is not an obstacle for the use of the coupling estimators 

2,1(cid:136)γ  and δ(cid:136) . 

Observational noise is present, independent sources of dynamical noise. Dynamical noise level 

is fixed to be σ = 0.025. Independent observational noises are added to the variables 

2,1x

. They are 

Gaussian  and  white  and  have  the  same  standard  deviation  s  which  is  varied  in  the  range  [0,0.4]. 

Range of the method efficiency is shown in Fig. 6 (c). In relative units along vertical axis (ratio of s 

to the standard deviation of 

2x  which is equal to 1.5), one obtains that observational noise level up 

to 25 % may be allowable. Again, the range of the method applicability is not infinitesimally small 

but rather significant.

3.5. Application to EEG data 

The  data  were  recorded  from  intracranial  depth  electrodes  implanted  in  a  patient  with  medi-

cally-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy as part of routine clinical investigations to determine candi-
dacy for epilepsy surgery. The recordings included several left temporal neocortical → hippocam-

pal seizures that occurred over the course of a long partial status epilepticus, see an example in Fig. 

7  (a).  Two  channels  were  analyzed:  the  first channel situated in the left hippocampus, the second 

channel in the left temporal neocortex, where the (cid:147)interictal(cid:148) activity between seizures at the time 

was  comprised  of  pseudoperiodic  epileptiform  discharges.  Visual  analysis  of  the  interictal-ictal 

transitions  (shown  with  vertical  dashed  lines)    determined  that  the  seizures  all  started  first  in  the 

neocortex, with an independent seizure subsequently beginning at the ipsilateral hippocampus. We 

analyzed 4 recordings, but here we present the results for only one of them for the sake of brevity, 

simply as an illustration of application of the method to a nonstationary real-world system.

directionality index and mean phase coherence for the phase obtained via Hilbert transform. Nega-
tive delta values correspond to coupling direction neocortex → hippocampus (approximately from 

the  20th  second  to  the  50th  second).  Both  signals  are  preliminarily  low-pass  filtered  with  cut-off 

frequency of 25 Hz. Window length is N = 6000, 500 phase values at each edge are discarded. d) 

Coupling directionality index and mean phase coherence for the phase obtained via wavelet trans-

form, time scales correspond to the maxima of the scalograms, they are s = 0.14 sec for the hippo-

campal  signal,  and  s  =  0.19  sec  for  the  neocortex  signal.  Window  length  is  N = 6000, 130 phase 

values at each edge are discarded. 

The time series of Fig. 7 (a) contains 4.5 min of depth electrode EEG (referential recording to 

scalp vertex electrode) recorded at a sampling frequency of 250 Hz. Their spectrograms are shown 

in Fig. 7 (b). One can see more or less significant peaks in power spectra for both channels. For the 

hippocampal  channel:  at  frequency  3.2  Hz  before  the  seizure  (starting  approximately  at  the100th 

second and finishing approximately at the 220th second), 2.3 Hz after the seizure, and 7.1 Hz during 

 
16

 

 

the seizure. For the neocortex channel: at frequency 1.4 Hz before the seizure, 1.6 Hz after the sei-

zure, and 7.1 Hz during the seizure.  

We have computed coupling characteristics in a running window. The length of running win-
dow was changed from N = 1000 data points to  N = 10 000 data points. The value of τ was also 

changed from 25 to 1000 (the best results are expected for approximately τ = 33 or 100 correspond-

ing to the (cid:147)main frequencies(cid:148) of oscillations). The phases were determined using both versions of 

the analytic signal approach. For filtering with subsequent Hilbert transform, we tried different fre-

quency  bands:  low-pass  filter  with  cut-off  frequencies  12.5  Hz  and  25  Hz,  band-pass  filters  with 

frequency  bands  around  2.5  Hz  and  7.1  Hz,  etc.  For  wavelet  transform,  we  used  Morlet  wavelet 
=ω  and different time scales s. In particular, we tried the time scales corresponding to the 

with

main peak of the scalogram for each signal which is 
19.0=s

 sec for the neocortex signal. 

14.0=s

 sec for the hippocampal signal, and 

We  present  only  one  set  of  results,  in  Fig.  7  (c)  and  7  (d)  (gray  tail  denotes  95%  confidence 
bands for δ) obtained for windows of the length N = 6000. Coupling is regarded as significant if the 

confidence band does not include zero, e.g., gray tail does not intersect the abscissa axis. The pre-

liminary results seem promising for localization of the epileptic focus, because a long interval (30 
second length for the example shown) of significant predominant coupling direction neocortex → 

hippocampus is observed before the seizure. It can be considered as indication that epileptic focus is 

located near neocortex that agrees with a priori clinical information. Despite only a single example 

is presented, we note that the results are sufficiently robust and are observed for a significant range 

of values of the above mentioned window lengths and parameters of filters and wavelets.  

Similar results of this type are observed for the three of the four analyzed recordings and not 

observed for one of them. Right now, we do not draw any definite conclusions about applicability 

of  the  method  to localize epileptic focus. This is only the first attempt and, of course, more EEG 

recordings should be processed to quantify the method(cid:146)s sensitivity and specificity. This is a subject 

of  ongoing  research.  Therefore,  the  results  presented  in  this  Section  should  not  be  overestimated, 

being rather an illustration of the way how to apply the method in practice and what kind of infor-

mation one can expect from it. 

4. DISCUSSION 

Numerical experiments demonstrate that the estimators of coupling between oscillatory systems 

based  on  phase  dynamics  modeling  are  sufficiently  widely  applicable.  Although  they  are  derived 

under  the  strict  assumption  of  linear  uncoupled  oscillators  and  independent  sources  of  Gaussian 

white  noise,  they  are  valid  for  various  dynamical  noise  properties  including  the  case  of  common 

 
17

 

• 

• 

• 

• 

noise and finite (not negligibly small) strengths of nonlinearity, coupling, and observational noise. 

Thus, we conclude that 
•  variation of ACFs and PDFs of dynamical noise in difference equation for the phase dynamics  

does not affect applicability of the estimators; 

significant individual phase nonlinearity of the oscillators (up to 30-300 % of the linear compo-

nent of the restoring force), unidirectional coupling strength (up to 30-40%), and observational 

noise (up to 25 %) may be allowable;  

the (cid:147)rule of thumb(cid:148) that mean phase coherence close to 0.6 warns about problems is generally 

confirmed, but strictly speaking any value of 

0

8.0

 is neither a sufficient nor a necessary 

< ρ

<

indicator  for  the  estimators(cid:146)  applicability  (on  the  one  hand,  they  may  be  biased  already  for 
1.0≈ρ

, on the other hand, they may be quite efficient even for 

8.0≈ρ

); 

the probability of correct conclusion about coupling character is very small for weak coupling 

and large noise, but the corresponding bound moves apart with increase in time series length N 

at fixed sampling frequency (increase in the number of basic periods contained in a time series); 

the probability of erroneous conclusion about coupling character is high for strong coupling due 

to  considerable  synchrony  of  oscillations,  the  corresponding  bound  depends  relatively  slightly 

on N especially for low dynamical noise level. 

When  the  modified  EMA  approach  is  not  reliable  (ill-defined  phases,  too  strong  noise,  too 

strong  coupling,  too  strong  phase  nonlinearity),  other  techniques  may  be  efficient.  Thus,  well-

known cross-correlation function and Fourier coherence are the methods of choice for very strong 

coupling and high level of observational noise. Moreover, they can be easily applied to short time 

series. However, the reverse of the medal is that they are capable of detecting only very strong and 

simple  (linear)  relationships  between  the  oscillators(cid:146)  dynamics  and,  generally  speaking,  they  may 

reveal  only  the  presence  of  coupling,  not  directionality.  There  exist  nonlinear  generalizations  of 
these techniques such as information-theoretic approaches4,5 and nearest neighbors statistics in re-
constructed state spaces6,7,9. These nonlinear techniques are more advanced in that they can reveal 

weak and complicated (nonlinear) interactions and their directionality, but simultaneously they are 

much  more  demanding  in  respect  of  time  series  length.  Detailed  comparison  of  one  of  the  state 

space approaches and the modified EMA is given in Ref. 21. A strong coupling making the systems 

close to some type of synchronous regime (possibly nonlinear) is readily detected even in the pres-
ence  of  observational  noise  with  (cid:147)multidimensional  phase  coupling(cid:148)13  (for  detection  of  interrela-
tions  in  reconstructed  state  spaces)  or  mean  phase  coherence15  (for  detection  of  interrelations  be-

tween the phases).

It is not possible here to discuss in detail various relationships between different coupling char-

acterization  techniques.  However,  we  would  like  to  stress  that  methods  based  on  phase  dynamics 

analysis seem to be the best for coupling characterization between weakly coupled oscillatory sys-

tems  with  well-defined  phases,  a situation widely spread in practice. The EMA is one of the best 

among these techniques as shown in Ref. 18. An approach very similar to the EMA was proposed 

by Kiemel et al in Refs. 14 and 20. It is based on construction of an empiric model for the phase 

dynamics in the form (3) with

. This approach is very close 

to  the  EMA  with  small  τ  since  in  this  case  the  difference  equation  (4)  is  an  accurate  integration 

scheme  for  the  differential  equation  (3).  Analogously  to  the  EMA,  the  approach  of  Kiemel  et  al 

would  suffer  from  the  bias  problem  for short time series and high dynamical noise level, but this 

bias could be corrected using considerations similar to that of Ref. 1. The main differences between 

the  EMA  and  the  approach  of  Kiemel  et  al  are  as  follows.  The  latter  does  not  require  very  weak 

coupling  or  nonlinearity,  since  model  parameters  are  estimated  via  (cid:147)honest(cid:148)  maximum  likelihood 

method involving integration of the Fokker-Planck equation. Due to the complexity of calculations, 

it is very time consuming. The former is more demanding with respect to weakness of oscillators(cid:146) 

nonlinearity and coupling (though not dramatically, as we showed here), but is much simpler and 
faster. Besides, the EMA is used with an optimal value of τ, typically about a basic period of oscil-

lations.  Such  a  choice,  as  a  rule,  provides  characteristics  with  significantly  greater  sensitivity  to 
weak coupling than small τ which is close to the approach of Kiemel et al. Finally, both approaches 

can be regarded as slightly different versions of the same phase dynamics modeling approach. 

The  modified  EMA  analyzed  here is the extension of the EMA to short time series so that it 

seems  to  be  a very powerful method and deserves special attention. Based on considering several 

exemplary oscillators, we formulated empiric conditions for applicability of the corresponding cou-

pling  estimators.  Even  though  these  conditions  could  be  somewhat  different  for  other  types  of 

nonlinearity  and  coupling  between  oscillators,  our  results  seem  sufficiently  representative  and  al-

ready allow to state that such conditions are rather mild. Thereby, we confirm the potential for the 

application  of  the  estimators  in  practice  to  analyze  real-world complex systems. In particular, our 

first attempt to apply them for epileptic focus localization from multichannel intracranial EEG re-

cordings illustrated in the present paper looks promising.

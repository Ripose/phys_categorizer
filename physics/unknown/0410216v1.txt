Abstract 
The  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  responsible  for  particle  transport  is  of  the  utmost 
importance for magnetized fusion plasmas. A peaked density profile is attractive to improve 
the fusion rate, which is proportional to the square of the density, and to self-generate a large 
fraction of non-inductive current required for continuous operation. 
Experiments  in  various  tokamak  devices  (AUG,  DIII-D,  JET,  TCV,  TEXT,  TFTR)  have 
indicated the existence of an anomalous inward particle pinch. Recently, such an anomalous 
pinch has been unambiguously identified in Tore Supra very long discharges, in absence of 
toroidal  electric  field  and  of  central  particle  source,  for  more  than  4  minutes  [1].  This 
anomalous  particle  pinch  is  predicted  by  a  quasilinear  theory  of  particle  transport  [2],  and 
confirmed  by  non-linear  turbulence  simulations  [3]  and general considerations based on the 
conservation  of  motion  invariants  [4].  Experimentally,  the  particle  pinch  is  found  to  be 
sensitive to the magnetic field gradient in many cases [5, 6, 7, 8], to the temperature profile 
[5, 9] and also to the collisionality that changes the nature of the microturbulence [10, 11, 12]. 
The consistency of some of the observed dependences with the theoretical predictions gives 
us  a  clearer  understanding  of  the  particle  pinch  in  tokamaks,  allowing  us  to  predict  more 
accurately the density profile in ITER. 
 
Introduction 
In tokamaks, the heat and particle transport occurs in the direction perpendicular to the nested 
toroidal magnetic flux surfaces. We refer to this direction as the radial direction and this is the 
unique  dimension  used  in  the  following.  Cross-field  heat  and  particle  transport  in  fusion 
plasmas  is  only  partly  caused  by  the  collisional  mechanisms  described  by  neoclassical 
transport  theory.  The  measured  heat  diffusivity  is  much  higher  than  expected  from 
neoclassical  prediction,  the  difference  being  referred  as  “anomalous”  transport  (see  for 
example [12]), believed to be driven by microturbulence. .  
The  particle  transport  case  is  somewhat  different  from  the  heat  transport.  Indeed,  the  heat 
source is often located in the core of the plasma making the distinction between a pinch and a 
diffusivity term very difficult. On the contrary, the particle source is often located in the outer 
edge  region  only.  In  such  cases  peaked  density  profiles  are  nevertheless  observed,  they  are 
attributed  to  a  particle  pinch.  A  simple  way  to  express  both  the  diffusive  and  the  pinch 
contributions to the particle flux, G,

Where n is the density profile, D is the diffusion coefficient and V is the pinch velocity. This 
formulation assumes that D and V are respectively weak functions of n and (cid:209) n. This article 
reviews  particle  transport  in  steady  state  conditions,  for  a  review  on  perturbative  particle 
transport see [Car].  
A neoclassical pinch called the Ware pinch [14] has been long identified and compared with 
experimental  observations.  Indeed,  for  example,  in  [13]  the  relaxation  of  a  density  profile 
after  a  Deuterium  pellet  could  be  modelled  with  a  pinch  velocity  of  the  order  of  the 
neoclassical  pinch.  Whereas,  in  [15],  an  additional  anomalous  particle  pinch  was  needed  to 
reproduce the perturbed experiments.

On the theory side, various mechanisms responsible for anomalous particle pinch have been 
identified, some due to the magnetic field gradient [16, 17, 21] other linked to the temperature 
gradient [2,18].  
But it is only lately that the anomalous particle transport has been unambiguously proven in 
steady-state conditions. To prove the existence of this anomalous pinch the experiment must 
have  no  neoclassical  pinch  and  no  central  particle  source.  These  two  conditions  have  been 
reached in Tore Supra and TCV plasmas [1, 6] where the density profiles remained peaked. It 
reinforces other experimental observations in favour of the existence of an anomalous particle 
pinch [7, 8,10,15, 19].  
The  object  of  this  paper  is  to  review  the  actual  understanding  of  the  particle  pinch  in 
tokamaks. First we will review the theoretical predictions of this pinch and present the latest 
unified view of these predictions. Then we will review the different experimental observations 
proving  the  existence  of  an  anomalous  particle  pinch.  The  parametric  dependences  of  this 
pinch  found  experimentally  will  be  confronted  with  the  theoretical  predictions.  Finally,  the 
prediction of ITER density profile and its impact on the fusion power will be discussed. 
 
1. Theoretical studies of anomalous particle transport 
The particle flux (G ) can be divided in two parts, a part generated by the neoclassical transport 
(G neo) and a part generated by the microturbulence (G
G=G

turb).

The  neoclassical  part  of  the  particle  flux  is  well  understood  and  easily  modeled.  Indeed,  a 
pinch term, called the Ware pinch, has been identified in [14] where it is shown that, due to 
the  conservation  of  canonical  angular  momentum,  all  trapped  particles  drift  towards  the 
magnetic axis with a radial velocity Vneo such that:

with Ej  the toroidal electric field inducing the plasma current, Bq  the poloidal magnetic field. 
Other neoclassical effects other than the ware pinch, such as the neoclassical thermodiffusion, 
also contribute to the pinch and are modelled by neoclassical codes such as NCLASS [20].  
The  “anomalous”  part  of  the  flux  generated  by  the  microturbulence  can  be  divided  in 
diffusive and convective terms as follows: G
Dturb is the diffusion coefficient and Vturb is the velocity pinch due to microturbulence. 
Various theoretical predictions of the turbulent particle flux have been made, two main 
mechanisms have been identified: turbulence equi-partition and thermodiffusion.  
The first mechanism is due to the existence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field in a tokamak 
induced both by the curvature and a parallel gradient of the field. In particular, the gradient of 
the magnetic field traps part of the particles in the magnetic well. The trapped particles are 
therefore responsible for instabilities especially sensitive to the magnetic field inhomogeneity. 
This mechanism is well described in [21], where it is found that the density of collisionless 
trapped particles is constant on hyper-surfaces defined by the conservation of the two first 
adiabatic invariants which leads to a density of trapped electrons proportional to 1/q. q is the 
safety factor and is equal to the ratio between the poloidal magnetic flux and the toroidal 
magnetic flux. q increases from the core to the edge, therefore a density proportional to 1/q 
leads to a peaked profile. The magnetic field gradient term is in fact proportional to magnetic 
shear when Trapped Electron Modes (TEM) are dominant, as shown in [15, 16] where the 
effect of collisions and of passing ions is included. We will refer to this mechanism as the 
curvature pinch. The collisions can detrap some of the trapped electrons and therefore weaken 
the role of the curvature pinch. 

G
The second mechanism is the thermodiffusion. It predicts a velocity pinch for sufficiently 
high h
 = (cid:209) T/T / (cid:209) n/n [17, 22, 23, 24, 25] due to cold low velocity particles diffuse faster than 
hot and fast particles. It has also been observed in electron drift wave turbulence simulation in 
slab geometry [26]. 
Other analyses based on a more global approach of the drift wave equations for electrons and 
ions  are  finding  that  both  mechanisms, curvature pinch and thermodiffusion, are inducing a 
particle  pinch.  For  example,  an  analytical  approach  of  the  linear  drift  kinetic  equation  is 
presented  in  [4],  2D  simulations  in  [2],  computed  particle  trajectories  in  [mis],  quasi-linear 
approach  in  [9]  and  3D  fluid  model  with  a  complementary  analytical  analysis  in  [3].  These 
more global approaches show that the curvature particle pinch is always directed inward, but 
that the “thermodiffusion” term can either be directed inward when Ion Temperature Gradient 
modes (ITG) are dominant and outward when TEM are dominant. In particular, the curvature 
pinch  mechanism  presented  in  [16]  can  be  recovered  in  the  limit  of  small  electron  pressure 
fluctuations,  i.e  in  the  case  where  trapped  electrons  behave  as  “test  particles”  in  turbulence 
mainly due to ion modes [3]. These various effects are illustrated on figure 1 from [3] where 
the  density  profiles  are  the  results  of  microturbulence  simulations  where  the  flux  is  fixed 
rather  than  the  gradient.  The  particle  flux  is  thus  maintained  to  zero  so  that  any  density 
peaking  is  the  signature  of  a  turbulent  pinch.  If  only  the  curvature  terms  are  taken  into 
account,  a  peaked  profile  is  observed.  Then  when  the  thermodiffusion  mechanism  is 
implemented,  the  impact  on  the  profile  varies  strongly  with  the  ratio  of  electron  heating 
versus ion heating, Pe/Pi. When Pe/Pi = 1, the density profile is similar to the curvature only 
case. When the ion heating dominates the electron heating the inward pinch is reinforced and 
the density profile is more peaked, the ITG modes are dominant. On the contrary, when the 
electron heating dominates, the density profile becomes hollow, the TEM dominates and the 
thermodiffusion term due to the TEM is stronger than the inward pinch due to the curvature. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A simple way to represent this unified theoretical view of the pinch due to drift waves in the 
case of no central particle source and no neoclassical pinch is to write: 
 = G
so: (cid:209) n/n = Vturb / Dturb = -Cq (cid:209) q/q + CT (cid:209) Te/Te (6) 
Cq and CT are the respective factors weighting the two contributions to the anomalous particle 
pinch.  In  this  non-linear  approach,  the  thermodiffusion  can  become  the  dominant  pinch 
mechanism; this is not observed in a quasi-linear approach [9] where Cq is found to be always 
of  order  unity  whereas  CT  becomes  similar  only  for  specific  density  and  temperature 
gradients. The fact that the non-linear simulations presented in Fig. 1 do not take the impact 
of collisions into account that might weaken the outward thermodiffusion term. Another open 
issue  concerns  the  role  of  passing  electrons.  In  the  approaches  presented  above  the  passing 
electrons are either not taken into account [2,3], or expected to have no impact on the particle 
pinch  [4].  But  recent  simulation  results  from  [27]  show  that  passing  electrons  lead  to  an 
inward pinch in cases where TEM drive an outward pinch.

2. Experimental evidence for anomalous particle pinch 
To conclude unambiguously on the existence of an anomalous particle pinch, two important 
conditions have to be reached experimentally: the particle source inside a given radius must 
be negligible and the neoclassical pinch due to the loop voltage inducing the current must be 
also  negligible.  Under  such  conditions,  (cid:209) n/n  =  (Vneo+Vturb)  /  D,  with  Vneo~0,  therefore  the 
existence of a density gradient means the existence of anomalous particle pinch.

In  tokamaks,  the  source  of  particles  has  different  origins.  The  first  obvious  thing  to  do,  in 
order to identify the anomalous particle pinch, is to avoid any central fuelling due to the use 
of Neutral Beam Injection to heat the plasma and any gas puffing techniques such as pellet 
injection, supersonic injection, etc as well as to control the source of electrons coming from 
heavy ions ionization. When avoiding such conditions, the remaining particle source is due to 
the wall out gassing. This particle source is due to various phenomena: recycled Deuterium 
coming  from  the  Carbon  tiles,  direct  ionization  of  the  molecular  Hydrogen,  molecular 
dissociation and creation of Franck-Condon pairs and charge-exchange of atomic Deuterium, 
which  include  molecules,  atoms,  charge  exchange,  etc.  Each  of  these  mechanisms  has  a 
penetration  length  that  varies  from  less  than  1  cm  to  up  to  10  cm.  Therefore  larger  the 
tokamak  is,  easier  it  is  to  well  localize  the  particle  source  at  the  edge.  The  particle  source 
evaluation needs Monte Carlo codes, such as [28, 29].  
- About the neoclassical pinch issue 
To prove unambiguously the existence of an anomalous particle pinch, an experiment has also 
to be performed without neoclassical pinch, so that: (cid:209) n/n = Vturb/ D. To reach experimentally 
this situation, the plasma current circulating in the torus has to be fully non-inductively driven 
for a time longer than the resistive diffusion time. It is only in such condition that a zero loop 
voltage can be reached across the whole plasma.  
These experimental conditions have been reached in two tokamaks. In TCV, the full current 
drive situation was obtained using fast electrons from Electron Cyclotron waves (ECCD) [6] 
for  over  4  s  versus  a  current  diffusion  time  of  0.4  s.  In  Tore  Supra,  the  full  current  drive 
provided by the fast electrons produced by Lower Hybrid waves (LHCD) has been maintained 
for more than 4 minutes, more than 80 times the current diffusion time [1]. The density profile 
obtained in such conditions is shown on figure 2.

Once  these  experimental  conditions  are  reached,  one  can  deduce  from  the  density  profile 
peaking the ratio between Vturb and D as follows: 
Vturb/D = (cid:209) n / n = - Cq (cid:209) q/q + CT (cid:209) T/T 
In cases where the neoclassical Ware pinch is not zero, the analysis of experimental results 
may  lead  to  contradictory  conclusions.  In  some  cases  the  observed  pinch  is  found  to  be  in 
agreement with V = Vware, and D proportional to the heat diffusivity (c eff ) as found for JET 
high  density  H-modes  [11,  30]  and  in  ASDEX-U  at  high  density  plasmas  [31,  32].  Earlier 
results  from  a  perturbative  particle  transport  study  in  TFTR  [12]  had  also  shown  that  a 
neoclassical  pinch  could  explain  the  observed  density  profile  relaxation.  But  in  most  other 
cases, the density profile cannot be explained by a neoclassical pinch alone. This is the case 
for JET L-modes [7, 11], DIII-D plasmas [8], TEXTOR RI modes [33] and of course for the 
TCV  and  Tore  Supra  results  [1,6].  An  anomalous  particle  pinch  was  also  invoked  much 
earlier to explain Hydrogen density modulation experiments in TEXT [15] where a velocity 
an order of magnitude above the neoclassical pinch velocity, scaling as 1/(nq), was needed to 
reproduce the observed peaked density profiles. 

 
3.  Parametric dependences of the anomalous particle pinch 

After  having  demonstrated  the  existence  of  an  anomalous  particle  pinch  in  section  2,  the 
parametric  dependences  of  this  pinch  are  now  compared  to  the  theoretical  predictions 
presented  in  section  1.  In  particular  the  predicted  dependence  versus  (cid:209) q/q,  i.e.  versus  the 
current  profile  shape,  is  tested  as  well  as  the  dependence  versus  the  temperature  profiles. 
Finally,  since  the  behaviors  are  expected  to  be  different  whereas  the  trapped  particles  are 
dominant or not, the dependence versus collisionality is also tested.  
The particle flux is expressed as follows: 
 /n = -D((cid:209) n/n + (Cq (cid:209) q/q - CT (cid:209) T/T))+Vneo 
 being between 0.5 and 1, has been widely tested. In TFTR, 
Density profile scaling as 1/q
the density profiles are well fitted by the curvature pinch formula from [16]. In JET L-mode 
plasmas with LHCD [7], the peaking of the temperature profiles and of the current profiles are 
uncorrelated,  therefore  their  respective  effects  on  the  density  profile  can  be  identified.  It  is 
found  that,  ne0/<ne>  scales  as  the  plasma  normalized  internal  inductance  li,  Fig.  3.  This 
scaling is independent of (cid:209) Te/Te and of the effective collisionality. The density profiles can 
be fitted using the curvature pinch formula from [16].

A linear gyrokinetic analysis done on these plasmas 
has been performed with GS2 [34] and shows that 
the  unstable  modes  are  both  ITG  and  TEM.  This 
could explain the lack of dependence versus 1/LTe= 
-(cid:209) Te/Te evaluated at mid-radius.  
 

In  TCV  [6],  density  profiles  can  be  described  with  a  curvature  pinch  only,  with  0.4£ Cq£ 1. 
Most  of  the  density  profiles  in  Ohmic  and  ECH  discharges,  can  also  be  reproduced  with 
suitable  combinations  of  the  Ware  pinch  and  the  anomalous  curvature  pinch,  assuming  for 

 

G
h
instance  Cq  =  0.45  and  D/c eff  =  0.4.  In  DIII-D  also  [8],  most  of  the  density  profiles  can  be 
reproduced using an anomalous pinch term based on the adiabatic invariants approach.  
There  is  less  evidence  for  a  correlation  between  the  density  profile  and  the  temperature 
gradient, in particular because it is often difficult to decorrelate the temperature profile from 
the  current  profile.  Nevertheless,  a  density  flattening,  called  “pump-out”,  is  commonly 
observed in response to central electron heating by ECH or LH. In some cases, the flattening 
can be explained by neoclassical pinches. The neoclassical thermodiffusion may be reversed 
if the axisymmetrical configuration is lost, leading to hollow density profiles, as seen in TCV 
with  strong  central  ECH,  when  a  saturated  (1,1)  island  is  present  [36].  In  other  cases,  the 
“pump-out” seems consistent with the existence of an anomalous thermodiffusion term. This 
is the case for the hollow density profiles observed with strong central LH in ASDEX [37]. 
Also, in ECH ASDEX-Upgrade plasmas (including L- and H-modes), where the nature of the 
unstable  modes  calculated  with  a  gyrokinetic  code  [34]  is  found  to  be  consistent  with  a 
thermodiffusion  mechanism  [9].  If  the  ITG  modes  are  dominant,  the  density  profile  is  not 
affected significantly by central ECH. When the density flattening is observed, Te increases at 
fixed (cid:209) Te/Te, and reinforces the TEM outward pinch. 
In  a  non-linear  microstability  analysis  of  Alcator-C  mod  [38]  density  Internal  Transport 
Barriers,  the  degradation  of  the  confinement  is  associated  to  an  outward  thermodiffusion 
particle pinch due to the onset of TEM.  
In  Tore  Supra,  plasmas  with  no  neoclassical  Ware  pinch  can  be  studied  in  conditions  in 
which:  (cid:209) n/n  =  -Cq  (cid:209) q/q  +  CT  (cid:209) T/T,  [5].  In  the  core,  r/a  £
  0.30,  with  a,  the  minor  radius, 
(cid:209) ne/ne is strongly correlated to (cid:209) Te/Te with CT > Cq. This inward pinch is consistent with the 
thermodiffusion mechanism since, using a gyrokinetic code Kinezero [39], the ITG modes are 
found  to  be  dominant  in  this  region.  At  mid  radius,  0.35  £
  0.6,  on  the  contrary,  the 
density  peaking  is  found  to  be  weakly  correlated  with  the  temperature  profile,  Cq  >  CT.  At 
these radii, the linear gyrokinetic simulations show that the TEM are dominant.

Collisionality is a parameter expected to have a strong impact on the density profiles, since it 
affects the role of trapped particles crucial for the curvature pinch [10]. The collisionality, n eff, 
is  the  ratio  of  the  collisionality  detrapping  the  electrons  over  the  vertical  drift  frequency  of 
trapped electrons. n eff characterizes the impact of collisions on TEM. In H modes on ASDEX 
Upgrade [10] and on JET [30, 40], the density peaking decreases with increasing n eff, Fig. 5 
[Ang].

density  at  r/a  =  0.4  and  r/a  =  0.8, 
ne(0.4)/ne(0.8), is plotted versus n eff.  
The  density  peaking  is  strongly  reduced  as 
the  collisionality  increases  independently  of 
the  value  of  q  at  the  edge.  For  ITER  n eff is 
expected to be around 0.1. 

 

Neoclassical effects cannot explain the density peaking decrease at increasing collisionality. 
Indeed, a higher collisionality implies a higher resistivity, therefore a lower Ej , hence a lower 
Ware pinch, see eq. (4). A detailed analysis using quasi-linear fluid drift wave modelling [10], 
finds the n eff dependence consistent with the observed ITG and TEM responding to the 
curvature pinch. Nevertheless, some puzzling paradoxes are observed. Indeed, in a curvature 
pinch cases, a q profile (li or q95) sensitivity is expected. But in JET [40] and ASDEX 
Upgrade H modes no such dependence is observed, expect at n eff < 0.3 in JET, where the 
sensitivity to q profile is recovered. This unseen q profile dependence in most H modes is 
very difficult to understand. On the contrary, in JET L-modes [7], the density peaking 
strongly depends on li (Fig. 3) but is insensitive to n eff. This could be explained by a q profile 
sensitivity mainly due to trapped ions rather than trapped electrons explaining the unseen n eff 
dependence.  
Discussion: 
Recently the particle transport has made progress on both experimental and theoretical sides 
on various tokamaks. This has led to significant progress in our understanding of the origin of 
the commonly observed particle pinch.  
Indeed, an anomalous contribution to this pinch has been unambiguously determined in two 
tokamaks [1,6]. The two anomalous particle pinch contributions predicted by the theory, one 
scaling  with  the  magnetic  field  gradient,  the  other  scaling  sensitive  with  the  temperature 
gradient, are now understood as specific solutions of the general drift equations [2, 3, 4]. Still 
the role of passing electrons, so far mostly neglected, has to be studied carefully. Nevertheless 
the theoretical picture proposed in [3, 4] is consistent with several aspects of the experimental 
observations.  
In most of the tokamak plasmas, the density profile in the gradient zone is well fitted by 1/q

, 
 ranging between 0.5 and 1 [5,7,8,16]. Near the magnetic axis, both the neoclassical pinch 
and  the  anomalous  thermodiffusion  pinch  play  a  role  [5,9,37].  The  thermodiffusion 
mechanism is not clearly understood, a non-linear approach without collisions [3] predicts it 
to be dominant in some cases, whereas a collisional quasi-linear approach [9] predicts it to be 
weaker  than  the  curvature  pinch  as  observed  experimentally.  When  a  dependence  on 
collisionality is observed, it is always a density peaking that decreases at higher collisionality, 
so opposite to the Ware pinch mechanism [40, 10]. But, at a given n eff, H modes exhibit clear 
n eff  dependence  and  L-modes  no  dependence  at  all  [40].  These different behaviors with n eff  
are not yet understood.  
In the light of the experimental results presented here, a flat density profile is the worst 
expectation for ITER. To illustrate the impact of a peaked density profile on the fusion power, 
ITER plasma performance has been simulated using a density profile scaling as 1/q
 [art] in 
the 0-D scaling law of the code CRONOS [41]. These simulations have been performed in a 
consistent manner using mixed empirical scalings and the global energy confinement scaling 
law ITERH-98P(y,2) [42] . An increase of the effective charge  (from 1..55 to 1.7) depending 

0.5

on the radiated power and on electron density [43] is included. For the ITER reference 
scenario with 40 MW of Neutral Beam Heating, a fusion power of 530 MW (Q ~ 13) is 
obtained with the effect of inward curvature pinch, to be compared with 400 MW (Q =10) 
when using the flat density profile currently expected for ITER.

Abstract 

Imidazoline-based nitroxide radicals are often used as spin probes for medium acidity and 

polarity in different systems. In this work, using the density functional theory (DFT) approach, we 

have  studied  how  physico-chemical  characteristics  (geometry,  atomic  charges  and  electron  spin 

density  distribution)  of  pH-sensitive  spin  label  4-amino-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-imidazoline-N-oxyl 

(ATI)  depend  on  protonation  and  aqueous  surroundings.  Our  calculations  demonstrate  that  ATI 

protonation  should  occur  at  the  nitrogen  atom  of  the  imidazoline  ring  rather  than  at  the  amino 

group. Protonation of ATI leads to a decrease in a spin density on the nitrogen atom of the nitroxide 

fragment >N-O•. For simulation of ATI hydration effects, we have constructed a water shell around 

a spin label molecule by means of gradual (step-by-step) surrounding of ATI with water molecules 

(

n

OH 2

 = 2-41).  Calculated  spin  density  on  the  nitrogen  atom  of  the  nitroxide  fragment  increased 

with  an  extension  of  a  water  shell  around  ATI.  Both  protonation  and  hydration  of  ATI  caused 

certain changes in calculated geometric parameters (bond lengths and valence angles). Investigating 

how structural and energy parameters of a system ATI−(H2O)n depend on a number of surrounding 

water  molecules,  we  came  to  the  conclusion  that  a  hydrogen-bonded  cluster  of 

n

≥  41  water 

OH 2

molecules could be considered as an appropriate model for simulation of ATI hydration effects.

1. Introduction 

Nitroxide  radicals  are  widely  used  as  spin  probes  in  different  fields  of  chemistry,  physics 

and  biology  to  investigate  structural  and  dynamic  properties  of  biopolymers,  membranes  and 
different  nanostructures1-12.  Nitroxide  radicals  also  serve  as  molecular  probes  for  oxygen  and  its 
active  forms13-16.  Practical  usage  of  spin  probes  is  based  on  sensitivity  of  their  electron 

paramagnetic  resonance  (EPR)  spectra  to  molecular  mobility  and  environment  (medium  polarity, 
pH,  microviscosity  and  ordering  of  solvent  molecules)1-3,17-20.  A  development  of  adequate 

theoretical  approaches  to  determination  of  structural  and  EPR  characteristics  of  spin  probes  still 
remains as one of the most actual tasks of computational chemistry21-22. The most informative EPR 

parameters  of  nitroxide  radicals  are  the  g-tensor  and  hyperfine  splitting  tensor,  which  are 

determined  by  the  interaction  of  the  unpaired  electron  with  the  nitrogen  nucleus  of  the  >N−O• 

fragment.  Quantum  chemical  calculations  of  spectral  parameters  of  nitroxide  radicals  is 

complicated, in particular, by the necessity of accounting for interactions of nitroxide radicals with 

solvent  molecules.  It  is  well  known  that  polarity  of  a  solvent  strongly  effects  on  the  isotropic 
splitting constant, aiso(N), of nitroxide radicals1-9.  

Several  attempts  to  take  into  account  the  solvent  effects  were  undertaken  in  a  number  of 
theoretical  works23-31.  One  of  traditional  approaches  to  this  problem  is  based  on  the  use  of  a 
polarizable continual model (PCM)24-26. This model considers a solute molecule placed inside the 

cavity surrounded by a continual medium characterised by a dielectric constant ε. The cavity may 

be  specified,  e.g.,  as  a  set  of  overlapping  spheres  placed  at  atoms  of  a  solute  molecule.  This 

approach, however, neglects specific interactions between the solvent and spin probe molecules. A 

further  development of  this  model  was  suggested by Barone and collaborators  who combined the 

PCM  approach  with  a  direct  consideration  of  spin  probe  interactions  with  the  ‘local  aqueous 

surroundings’  (two  or  three  water  molecules  placed  in  the  vicinity  of  the  >N−O•  fragment)27-31. 

However,  even  in  this  case  additional  amendments  were  needed  to  get  satisfactory  values  of  aiso. 

Therefore,  it  seems  tempting  to  consider  more  realistic  model  for  hydrated  nitroxide  radicals  that 

would  take  into  account  the  interaction  of  a  spin  label  molecule  with  a  large  number  of  solvent 

molecules.  This  is  the  motivation  for  the  present  work.  One  of  important  issues  is  to  construct  a 

hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules that might be considered as an appropriate model for 

a complete first hydration sphere surrounding a spin label molecule.  

Among  a  great  variety  of  different  spin  labels,  imidazoline-based  nitroxide  radicals  are  of 
special interest for biological and chemical applications4,9. Spin probes of this kind are used as pH-

sensitive molecular probes, because the EPR spectra of protonated and deprotonated spin labels are 

characterized by different hyperfine splitting constants and, therefore, can be easily detected by the 
EPR  spectroscopy  method32-34.  In  this  work,  we  have  studied  the  influence  of  an  aqueous 

 

2

2

 

 

surroundings  on  physico-chemical  characteristics  (geometry,  energy,  distribution  of  charges  and 

electron  spin  density  on  atoms)  of  pH-sensitive  spin  probe  4-amino-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-

imidazoline-N-oxyl  (ATI)  (Fig.1).  Using  the  density  functional  method,  we  have  calculated  these 

characteristics for ATI molecules surrounded by various numbers of water molecules. We wanted to 

know  how  a  stepwise  extension  of  a  water  cluster  would  influence  on  structural  and  electron 

properties of ATI molecule. Thus we could evaluate a minimal size of a water cluster that might be 

considered as a model for a first hydration sphere around ATI. 

 

2. Computational strategy, methods and details 

Our computational strategy stems from the recent developments of advanced DFT methods 
for  low  cost  computations  of  rather  large  (more  than  100-150  atoms)  molecular  systems21.  All 

calculations  were  carried  out  with  the  use  of  the  original  program  PRIRODA  developed  by 
D.N. Laikov35.  This  program  allows  relatively  fast  DFT  calculations  to  be  performed  for  large 

molecular  systems  without  the  loss  of  computation  accuracy.  Therefore,  we  could  perform  our 

calculations on powerful PC during a moderate period of time.  

All  our  calculations  were  performed  with  exchange-correlation  functionals  PBE  and  BLYP. 

These functionals include electron density gradients. Functional PBE is one of the best generalized 

gradient  approximation  (GGA)  for  the  exchange-correlation  functional  by  Perdew,  Berke,  and 
Ernzerhof36.  Functional  BLYP  is  widely  used  for  calculations  of  spin  density  in  nitroxide 
radicals21,37.  Gaussian-type  basis  sets  and  the  expansion  of  electron  density  in  the  auxiliary  basis 
were used for the solution of Kohn-Sham equations39. We used two types of orbital and auxiliary 

basis  sets  (B1  and  B2).  Contraction  patterns  for  these  basis  sets  are  presented  in  Table  1. 

Geometries of all the systems considered in this work were optimized with the use of basis B1. Full 

optimization  of  geometry  was  performed  using  analytical gradients.  For gas  phase calculations, it 

was  followed  by  analytical  calculations  of  the  second  derivatives  of  energy  with  respect  to 

coordinates in order to characterize the nature of the resulting stationary points (minima or saddle 

points) on the potential energy surface. Basis B2 was used for single point calculations of energy 

and spin densities performed after preliminary geometry optimization with the use of basis B1. 

In  order  to  construct  an  aqueous  sphere  around  a  spin  label  protonated  at  the  position  of  the 
ring nitrogen N4, ATI(H+), we started with a small system (ATI(H+) + 2H2O) and then expanded 

step-by-step a size of a water cluster until a complete hydrogen-bonded water network surrounding 
ATI(H+) was formed (Fig.2). On the first stage, one water molecules was placed near the nitroxide 

fragment  >N−O•,  while  another  one  was  positioned  near  the  protonated  nitrogen  atom  of  the 

imidazoline ring. After the geometry of this system was optimised, other two H2O molecules were 

added  and  then  the  geometry  of  a  new  system  was  optimised  again.  Such  a  procedure  of  the 

3

3

 

 

stepwise expansion of a water cluster was repeated several times, until a complete hydrogen-bonded 
aqueous  shell  around  ATI(H+)  was  constructed.  Geometry  of  each  cluster  ATI(H+)−(H2O)n  was 

optimised  using  the  B1  basis  set.  Optimization  of  each  molecular  system  was  performed  without 
any symmetry constraints. The convergence limit used for geometry optimization was 10-7. 

On  the  basis  of  geometry  of  optimised  ATI(H+)−(H2O)41  cluster  we  constructed  three  other 
+)−(H2O)41; 

model  systems:  (i)  hydrated  ATI  molecule  with  protonated  amino  group,  ATI(-NH3

(ii) deprotonated  ATI  molecule  surrounded  with  41  H2O  molecules,  ATI−(H2O)41  and  (iii) 
deprotonated ATI molecule surrounded with one H3O+ and 40 H2O molecules, ATI-(H3O+)(H2O)40. 

In the first case, the proton bound to the nitrogen atom N4 of the imidazoline ring was transferred to 
+)−(H2O)41  was  re-optimised.  In  the 

the  amino  group  and  then  geometry  of  a  cluster  ATI(-NH3

second case, the proton bound to N4 atom was removed and then geometry of deprotonated system 

ATI−(H2O)41  was  re-optimised.  In  the  latter  case,  the  proton  was  transferred  to  the  nearest  water 

molecule  placed  in  the  vicinity  of  N4  atom  and  then  geometry  of  protonated  system  ATI-
(H3O+)(H2O)40 was re-optimised. 

For comparison, the solvation effects were also estimated using the IPCM model. This option is 

incorporated into the program PRIRODA35. 

Partitioning of charges and electron spin densities on the atoms of each optimized system was 

calculated according to the reference38.  The isotropic hyperfine coupling constant

measures the contacts Fermi interaction between the unpaired electron and the nitrogen nucleus of 

the >N−O• fragment, was calculated as

respectively. For calculations of 

)2N(isoa

 values, we used B2 or B1 basis sets, relying on a system 

geometry optimized previously with B1 basis set. 

To the best of our knowledge, there are no literature data regarding structural parameters of 

ATI molecule. Therefore, to verify the applicability of the computation methods used in this work, 

we  compared  results  of  our  calculations  performed  for  one  of  the  most  simple  nitroxides,  4 

hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl  (TEMPOL),  with  the  literature  data  -  experimental 
and  computed  structural  parameters  of  TEMPOL39.  Table  2  lists  geometry  parameters  of  two 

possible conformers of TEMPOL computed in our work at PBE/B1 and BLYP/B1 levels. One can 

see that both approaches give results which are in an agreement with calculated and experimental 
structural parameters of TEMPOL published earlier39.

3. Results and discussion 

 

3.1. Sites of ATI protonation. 

There  are  two  potential  protonation  sites  in  ATI  molecule  –  the  nitrogen  atom  N4  of  the 

imidazoline ring and the amino group (Fig. 1). To compare the probabilities of ATI protonation at 

these  sites,  we  calculated  the  energies  of  ATI  molecules  protonated  either  at  the  N4  position 
+)).  According  to  our 
(denoted  as  ATI(H+))  or  at  the  amino  group  (denoted  as  ATI(-NH3

calculations,  the  ring  nitrogen  N4  is  characterised  by  higher  affinity  to  proton  than  to  the  amino 

group.  For  ATI  molecule 

in 

the  gas  phase 

(Fig. 3A), 

the  energy  difference 

is

 = 31.4  kcal/mol.  The  energy  of  the  transition  state  [ATI−H+]#  of  the 

interconversion  process  ATI(H+) ↔ ATI(-NH3

+)  is  higher  than  the  energies  of  ATI(H+)  and 

ATI(−NH3

+) by 55.2 and 23.8 kcal/mol, respectively (Fig. 3A). Therefore, a direct proton transfer 

between the amino group and N4 atom should be hindered kinetically.  

Computations for hydrated ATI (clusters ATI(H+)−(H2O)41 and ATI(-NH3

+)−(H2O)41,) also 

demonstrate that the ring nitrogen N4 has higher affinity to proton than the amino group (Fig. 3B). 

In  this  case,  the  energy  difference  is  ∆Ewater =

  =  19.1  kcal/mol, 

which is smaller than ∆Egas. When ATI molecule is dissolved in water, the proton transfer between 

two  protonation  sites  (N4  and  N7  atoms)  could  occur  via  a  hydrogen-bonded  network  of  water 

molecules surrounding ATI. In order to evaluate the possibility of this mechanism, we calculated an 
energy  of  a  system  ATI−H3O+(H2O)40  consisted  of  deprotonated  ATI  molecule  surrounded  by  a 
water cluster H3O+(H2O)40. This system should simulate one of intermediate states on the way of 

the  proton  migration  between  the  amino  group  and  N4  atom  along  a  hydrogen-bonded  water 

network. The energy diagram shown in Fig. 3B demonstrates that the efficient activation energies 
+)−(H2O)41 ↔ ATI−H3O+(H2O)40 and ATI(H+)−(H2O)41 
for the proton transfer processes ATI(-NH3
↔  ATI−H3O+(H2O)40  are  E’a1 = 3.3  and  E’a2 = 22.4  kcal/mol,  respectively.  It  is  reasonable  to 

assume that the relatively low activation energy (3.3 kcal/mol) cannot be considered as an obstacle 

to  the  downhill  proton  transfer  from  the  amino  group  to  the  ring  nitrogen  N4.  Therefore,  we 

conclude that the proton binding would occur predominantly at the N4 atom of the imidazoline ring. 

Our conclusion is in agreement with experimental data on the EPR study of ATI spectra in water 
solution34. Bearing in mind this result, we consider below only the ATI(H+) form of protonated ATI 

molecule. 

 

3.2. Geometry parameters of ATI molecule.

In  this  section,  we  analyse  how  protonation  and  hydration  of  ATI  molecule  effect  on  the 

ATI geometry. Geometry parameters of ATI molecule (bond lengths, angles and torsions) presented 

in Table 3 were calculated for protonated and deprotonated ATI molecules in the gas phase or ATI 

molecule  surrounded  by  a  water  shell  of  41  H2O  molecules.  The  following  structural  parameters 

were analysed: 1) a bond length of the nitroxide fragment lN−O; 2) an angle α which characterises a 
deviation of the nitroxide fragment >N-O• from the plane determined by atoms N2, C3 and C6, 3) a 

dihedral  angle  β  which  is  the  complement  to  the  angle  formed  by  planes  N2−C3−C6  and 

С3−N4−C5−С6 (Fig. 1). Correctness of the choice of parameter β  is proved by the fact that four 

atoms  of  the  imidazoline  ring,  С3,  N4,  C5  and  C6,  are  situated  practically  in  one  plane.  Really, 

almost in all the cases presented in Table 3, the torsion angle С3-N4-C5-C6 is less than one degree. 

3.2.1. Effects of ATI protonation. 

Table 3 lists results of calculations that clearly demonstrate that protonation of N4 atom of 

the  imidazoline  ring  causes  certain  changes  in  the  ATI  geometry.  In  both  cases  (ATI  in  the  gas 

phase and hydrated ATI), the protonation leads to a certain shortage of the N2-O1 bond length and 

causes an elongation of the double bond between N4 and C5 atoms. Bond angles also change with 

ATI  protonation.  The  most  interesting  issue  is  a  reversal  of  the  signs  of  all  calculated  dihedral 

angles (except the C3-N4-C5-C6 one) upon the ATI protonation.  

3.2.2. Effects of ATI hydration. 

According  to  our  calculations  (Table  3),  water  surroundings  influence  on  geometry 

parameters  of  both  protonated  and  deprotonated  forms  of  ATI.  In  both  cases,  the  ATI  hydration 

causes an elongation of the bond lengths O1-N2 and N4-C5.  

In  order  to  evaluate  a  minimal  size  of  a  water  cluster  that  might  be  considered  as  an 

appropriate  model  for  a  complete  first  hydration  shell  around  ATI,  consider  how  structural 
parameters of ATI(H+) change with its stepwise surrounding by water. Fig. 4A shows the plot of a 
) in a cluster ATI(H+)−(H2O)n. Parameter 

bond length lN−O versus a number of water molecules (

n
OH2

lN−O increases with the rise of 

, reaching approximately the steady level lN−O ≈ 1,28 Å (at 

n
OH2

 = 

41). It is noteworthing that the main influence of water occurs after the addition of relatively small 

amounts of H2O molecules (

n

 ≤ 8). With a further increase in a number of water molecules, we 

n
OH2

OH 2

obtained  insignificant  variations  of  a  bond  length  lN−O  (in  the  interval  10 ≤ 

n

 ≤ 41).  These 

OH 2

variations  reflect  the  discreteness  of  the  system,  when  a  number  of  water  molecules  is  not  high 

enough to form a complete hydration shell around the ATI molecule.  

6

The  conclusion  about  the  water-induced  structural  distortions  of  the  ATI  geometry  can  be 

also illustrated by the plots of the valence angles α and β versus a number of water molecules in a 

cluster  ATI(H+)−(H2O)n  (Figs. 4B  and  4C).  For  ATI(H+)  molecule  in  the  gas  phase,  we  obtained 

that  α < 0  and  β > 0.  Addition  of  water  changed  the  signs  of  these  angles  (α > 0  and  β < 0). 

Similarly  to  structural  parameter  lN-O  (Fig. 4A),  these  changes  can  be  induced  by  relatively  small 

amounts  of  water  molecules.  We  also  obtained  certain  variations  of  parameters  α  and  β  in  the 

interval 10 < 

n

< 41. 

OH 2

Water-induced  structural  changes  in  ATI  molecule,  which  are  characterised  by  changes  in 

the  signs  of  torsion  angles,  indicate  that  this  molecule  could  have  two  possible  conformations 
(Fig. 5).  For  protonated  ATI(H+)  molecule  in  the  gas  phase,  the  energy  difference  calculated  for 

these conformers is very small (≤ 11 cal/mol). The energy barrier separating the two conformational 

states  is  ac. 100  cal/mol.  Fig. 4B  demonstrates  that  the  sign  of  an  angle  α  oscillates  with  the 
extension  of  a  water  cluster.  This  suggests  that  in  water  solution  ATI(H+)  could  exist  in  two 

different conformations. In case of incomplete hydration shell, however, a rigorous interpretation of 

ATI  structural  changes  is  complicated  by  the  lack  of  appropriate  experimental  data.  Note  that  an 

aqueous cluster around ATI molecule could be considered as an adequate model for the hydration 

shell  only  when  a  further  extension  of  this  cluster  would  influence  only  insignificantly  on  the 

structural parameters of a spin label. According to our calculations (Fig. 4), this should be the case 

when 

n

 ≈ 41.

3.3. Energy characteristics of ATI-Н+−(H2O)n clusters 

In  order  to  look  for  another  criteria  for  the  completeness  of  the  first  hydration  sphere,  we 
also  analysed  how  an  energy  of  a  cluster  ATI(Н+)−(H2O)n  depended  on  a  number  of  water 

molecules in the system. To characterise the interaction of one water molecule with other molecules 
of a cluster ATI(Н+)−(H2O)n, we consider the energy parameter ∆E(n)

Here, Е(0) is the energy of ATI in the gas phase, E0 relates to the energy of isolated water molecule 
in  the  gas  phase,  and  Е(n)  is  the  energy  of  ATI(Н+)−(H2O)n.  Thus,  parameter  ∆E(n)  represents  a 

mean energy of hydrogen bonds formed by one water molecule with other molecules in a system 
ATI(Н+)−(H2O)n. 

Fig. 6  shows  how  parameter  ∆E(n)  depends  on  a  number  of  water  molecules  surrounding 
ATI(Н+). The interaction of two H2O molecules with ATI(Н+), when one water molecule forms the 
hydrogen bond with the O1 atom of the >N-O• fragment and another one is placed near the N4 atom 

7

7

 

 

 

of the imidazoline ring, is characterised by the energy decrease ∆E(n) = −12.7 kcal/mol. For a rather 

small  number  of  water  molecules  (2 < 

n

 < 16),  parameter  ∆E(n)  oscillates  around  this  level. 

OH 2

When a number of water molecules becomes high enough (

n

 ≥ 26), parameter ∆E(n) decreases 

OH 2

up to the steady level ∆E(n) = −14.2 kcal/mol 1. This parameter remains practically unchanged with 

a further extension of a hydrogen-bonded water network around ATI (26 ≤ 

n

 ≤ 41). Thus, along 

with  the  data  presented  in  Section  3.2,  we  conclude  that  the  water  cluster  of 

n

≈ 40 molecules 

could be considered as an appropriate model for simulation of a complete water sphere around ATI.

3.4. The influence of water environment on electronic characteristics of ATI. 

In  this  section,  we  analyse  how  electronic  characteristics  of  ATI  (distributions  of  charges 

and spin density) depend on an aqueous surroundings of protonated and deprotonated forms of ATI. 

Figures 7  and  8  clearly  demonstrate  that  water  surroundings  (

n

  =  41)  causes  redistribution  of 

OH 2

spin density and charges on the atoms of both protonated and deprotonated ATI. Below we consider 

results of our calculations, performed at different levels of theory, in more details. 

 

3.4.1. Partial charges on atoms. 

 

Effects  of  protonation.  Fig. 7  shows  that  in  both  cases,  dehydrated  and  hydrated  ATI,  the 

proton binding to N4 atom causes definite changes in partial charges on the atoms of a spin labels 

molecule.  Protonation  of  ATI  is  accompanied  with  an  increase  of  charges  on  positively  charged 

atoms (O1, C3, C5, C6) and a concomitant decrease in charges of negatively charged atoms (O1, 

N4, N7). Charges on the atoms of methyl groups are effected by ATI protonation but only slightly.

in a pure water cluster formed of 27 water molecules. The formation of the network of hydrogen bonds between water

As  we  will  see  below  (section  3.4.2),  protonation-induced  changes  in  charges  on  atoms  are 

correlated with a certain redistribution of spin density in the nitroxide fragment of ATI molecule.

Effects  of  hydration.  Figure 7  shows  that  aqueous  environment  influences  on  charge 

distribution  in  both  deprotonated  and  protonated  forms  of  ATI  (Fig. 7).  The  most  significant 

changes  occur  in  the  nitroxide  fragment  N2-O1,  as  well  as  in  the  amino  group  and  N4-H  bond. 
Hydration  of  ATI  and  ATI(H+)  molecule  causes  a  rise  in  the  positive  charges  on  their  N2  atoms, 

whereas the negative charges on O1 atoms become smaller. As concerns the N4-H bond and amino 

group,  effects  of  water-induced  redistribution  of  charges  are  different  in  cases  of  protonated  and 

deprotonated  ATI.  For  deprotonated  form,  negative  charges  of  the  nitrogen  atoms  N4  and  N7 
decrease  after  a  spin  label  hydration.  In  contrast,  the  hydration  of  protonated  molecule  ATI(H+) 

results to a certain increase in the values of negative charges of N4 and N7 atoms. Positive charges 

of hydrogens in the amino group, as well as the positive charge of the hydrogen atom bound to the 

N4 atoms of the imidazoline ring, decrease with the ATI hydration.  

 

It is important to note that water-induced changes in charges on atoms cannot be attributed 

entirely to charge redistribution within a spin label molecule. Our calculations clearly demonstrate 
that water molecules surrounding ATI(H+) form hydrogen bonds with certain atoms of a spin label 

molecule  (the  amino  group  protons,  N4-H  group  proton,  and  the  oxygen  atom  of  the  nitroxide 

fragment).  These  hydrogen  bonds  provide  a  channel  for  a  “spillover”  of  partial  charges  from 
protonated  spin  label  to  neighbouring  water  molecules.  Actually,  the  total  charge  of  ATI(H+) 

molecule, which equals to QATI(H+) = +1 (a.u.) in the gas phase, decreases up to QATI(H+) = +0.45  
when  ATI(H+)  molecule  has  an  aqueous  environment  (

  =  41).  Remaining  charge

+0.55 is distributed over the water molecules of a cluster ATI(H+)-(H2O)41. This result demonstrates 
that charged ATI(H+) molecule causes the polarisation of a surrounding water cluster. In the case of 

deprotonated (neutral) ATI molecule, as we could expect, there is no significant charge spillover to 

an aqueous cluster (

To  analyse  the  charge  redistribution  effects  in  more  details,  let  us  consider  the  plots  of 

charges  on  atoms  O1  (QO1),  N2  (QN2)  and  N4  (QN4)  versus  a  number  (

)  of  water  molecules 

n

surrounding  ATI(H+)  (Fig. 9A).  One  can  see  the  following  trends:  a  positive  charge  QN2  on  the 

nitrogen atom N2 gradually increases with the rise of 

, whereas a negative charge QO1 on the 

n
OH2

oxygen  atom  O1  becomes  smaller.  The  nitrogen  atom  N4  of  the  imidazoline  ring  acquires 

additional negative charge. Computations with the use of two different basis sets (B1 or B2) gave

similar  results  (Fig. 9A,  Table  4).  Note  that  the  water-induced  redistribution  of  charges  is 

determined mainly by polarisation effects rather than due changes in ATI geometry. Actually, when 
we considered the “naked” ATI(H+) molecules (without water), which conformations were fixed so 
to imitate the water-induced structural changes in ATI(H+) geometry, computed partial charges QO1, 

QN2 and QN4 remained practically unchanged (Fig. 9B).  

3.4.2. Electron spin density on atoms. 

Figure 8  presents  the  distribution  of  spin  densities  over  the  atoms  of  protonated  and 

deprotonated ATI molecules in the gas phase or surrounded by 41 water molecules (here we show 

spin densities on atoms greater than 0.01 a.u.). Calculated electron spin density is localised mainly 

in the nitroxide fragment N-O, whereas spin densities on C3 and C6 atoms of the imidazoline ring 

and methyl groups are insignificant. One can also see from Fig. 8 that the redistribution of electron 

spin density induced by protonation and/or hydration of a spin label molecule occurs mainly in the 

N-O bond. Therefore, we consider below in more details only the nitroxide fragment of a spin label. 

Effects  of  protonation.  Fig. 8  shows  that  ATI  protonation  at  the  N4  position  leads  to  a 

certain decrease in the spin atom density on N2 atom (parameter σN2) at expense of the spin density 

on  the  oxygen  atom  O1  (parameter σO2).  For  ATI  in  the  gas  phase,  the  total  spin  density  in  the 

nitroxide fragment remains practically unchanged after ATI protonation (σN-O = σN2 + σO2 = 0.86). 

In hydrated ATI, parameter σN-O slightly decreases (from 0.83 to 0.81) with ATI protonation. 

Distribution of spin density in nitroxide radicals is usually interpreted qualitatively in terms 

of the two main resonance structures I and II (Scheme 1) which differ with respect to localisation of 

the unpaired electron on O1 and N2 atoms. A decrease in the σN2 value caused by the protonation of 

the nitrogen atom of the imidazoline ring could be explained by stabilisation of the structure I due 
to  the  rise  of  so  called  “electron  withdrawing  power”  of  the  N4  atom40.  This  explanation  is 

consistent with the fact that protonation of the N4 atom reduces its negative charge (Fig. 7). This, in 

turn, reduces the contribution of the dipolar resonance structure II, thus resulting in the decrease in 

a spin density on the N2 atom.  

Effects  of  hydration.  The  hydration  of  both  deprotonated  and  protonated  forms  of  ATI 

molecule causes a rise in a spin density on the N2 atom and concomitant decrease in σO2 value. A 

partial  displacement  of  spin  density  from  the  O1  atom  towards  the  N2  atom  can  be  explained  by 

water-induced stabilisation of the dipolar structure II at expense of the non-polar structure I. Below 

we  consider  the  hydration  effects  in  more  details,  focusing  our  attention,  for  certainty,  on  the 
protonated form of a spin label, ATI(H+). 

Fig. 10  shows  the  plots  of  parameters  σN2  and  σO2  versus  a  number  of  water  molecules 
surrounding ATI(H+), demonstrating the water-induced shift of spin density towards the N2 atom 

10

10

 

 

with a gradual hydration of a spin label. Calculations performed at two levels of theory (PBE/B1 

and  PBE/B2//B1)  led  us  to  similar  results.  Certain  irregularities  in  the  plots  of   σN2  and  σO1 

observed in the interval 10 ≤ 

 ≤ 35 could arise from the system discreteness, when a water shell 

n
OH2

around  a  spin  label  molecule  is  not  yet  high  enough  to  be  considered  as  a  complete  hydration 

sphere. The total spin density in the N-O fragment (σN-O = σN2 + σO2) slightly decreases (≤ 0.03-

0.05 a.u.) with a spin label hydration. According to our calculations, a minor spin density (ac. 0.02 

a.u.) appears on two water molecules situated in the nearest vicinity of the N-O fragment. Note that 

a water-induced increase in spin density σN2 on the nitrogen atom strongly correlates with a rise of 

its charge QN2 (Fig. 11A).  

Similarly to charge plot (Fig. 9B), spin density σN2 does not change with those variations of 
ATI(Н+) geometry that imitated the water-induced structural changes (Fig. 11A). This suggests that 

a partial shift of spin density from the oxygen atom O1 towards the nitrogen atom N2 is determined 
mainly  by  water-induced  polarisation  effect  rather  than  by  structural  distortions  of  ATI(Н+) 

molecule. We would also like to stress that calculations performed at different levels theory (Table 

4)  lead  to  similar  conclusions  about  the  protonation  and  hydration  effects  on  spin  density 

distribution in the N-O bond. 

 

3.4.3. Isotropic splitting constant aiso(N2). 

For  nitroxide  radicals,  the  isotropic  hyperfine  splitting  constant  aiso(N2)  is  determined  by 
spin density ρ( Nrr ) at the nitrogen nucleus41. Similarly to σN2 (Fig. 11A), the aiso(N2) value, which is 

proportional  to  calculated  parameter  ρ( Nrr ),  increases  with  the  ATI(H+)  hydration  (Table  5, 

Fig. 11B). However, contrary to spin density on atoms, an accurate theoretical determination of spin 

density  at  nuclei  is  very  difficult  task.  This  is  because  calculated  spin  densities  at  nuclei  are 

extremely  sensitive  to  a  choice  of  the  computation  method  (exchange-correlation  functional  and 

basis  set).  Therefore,  we  have  to  compare  experimental  data  with  theoretical  values  of  aiso(N2) 

computed at different levels of theory. 

According  to  EPR  data9,  deprotonated  ATI  molecule  in  water  is  characterized  by  the 

splitting  constant  aiso  =  15.8  G,  while  protonated  form  of  ATI  has  aiso  =  15.0 G.  Experimental 

hyperfine  splitting  constants  for  gas  phase  ATI  are  not  available.  As  one  of  approximations  to 

evaluation of gas phase constants, one could take the aiso values measured for spin labels dissolved 

in organic solvents, i.e., in CCl4. The comparison of EPR spectra of a variety of different spin labels 
dissolved  in  water  and  CCl4  (see  for  references1,7)  shows  that  the  difference  ∆aiso  =  aiso(H2O)  - 

aiso(CCl4)  falls  in  the  interval  from  1 G  to  2  G.  Bearing  in  mind  these  data,  it  is  reasonable  to 

propose that in the gas phase the hyperfine splitting constant should be about of aiso(gas) ≈ 13-14 G.  

11

11

 

 

Table 5 lists the aiso(N2) constants calculated with the use of different functionals and basis 

sets. One can see that aiso(N2) determined at the levels PBE/B2//B1 or BLYP/B2//B1, which have 

been used in most of our calculations, are closer to experimental constants than that computed with 
the use of B1 basis. For ATI and ATI(H+) in the gas phase, calculations at the level BLYP/B2//B1 

give  aiso(N2)  =  11.2 G  and  aiso(N2)  =  11.5 G,  respectively.  Smaller  values,  10.6  and  10.5,  were 

obtained  at  PBE/B2//B1  level  of  computations.  Calculations  with  the  use  of  basis  B1  lead  to 

substantially underestimated values of aiso(N2).  

Note that our calculations of aiso(N2) for gas phase ATI and ATI(H+) with GAUSSIAN98 

package  and  the  B3LYP  functional,  which  is  one  of  the  most  popular  approximations  in  DFT 
computations,  gave  scattered  results  depending  on  the  basis  set42.  Thus,  the  use  of  conventional 

approaches  to  calculations  of  aiso(N2),  e.g.,  B3LYP/6-31G  or  B3LYP/EPR-II,  does  not  give 

practical advantages over the calculation methods used in this work. In the meantime, the program 
PRIRODA35  allows  the  low  cost  computations  to  be  performed  without  the  loss  of  computation 

accuracy for such complex systems as that used in our work. 

Fig. 11B  shows  the  plot  of  aiso(N2)  versus  a  number  of  surrounding  water  molecules 

(calculations  at  PBE/B2//B1  level).  Parameter  aiso(N2)  non-monotonously  change  with  gradual 
expansion  of  a  water  shell  around  ATI(H+).  When  an  aqueous  sphere  around  ATI(H+)  becomes 

complete  (

n
OH2

  =  41),  the  water-induced  rise  of  aiso(N2)  comprises  ∆aiso(N2)  ≈  2.7 G,  which  is 

typical  of  experimental  difference  between  the  hyperfine  splitting  constants  measured  for  various 
nitroxide radicals dissolved in water and nonpolar solvents1,7. Comparing the results obtained with 

different functionals for hydrated ATI molecules (Table 5), one can see that functionals BLYP and 

PBE provide underestimated by 1.5-1.8 G values of aiso(N2). Concerning certain underestimations 

in computations of aiso(N2) with PBE and BLYP functionals, we would like to note that there is an 

obvious trend of increasing the aiso(N2) with the rise of 

. Therefore, one might expect to obtain 

n
OH2

realistic values of aiso(N2) if more water molecules were involved into an aqueous sphere around 

ATI.  Further  improvements  of  calculated  aiso(N2)  might  occur  due  to  proper  corrections  for  the 
vibrational modulations of aiso(N2). For instance, according to40, in 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl substituted 
nitroxides ∆aiso(N2)vibr ≈ 1 G. 

It  was  also  temping  to  simulate  the  effect  of  an  aqueous  environment  by  using  the  IPCM 

approach.  However,  results  of  our  calculations  (Table  6)  clearly  demonstrate  that  the  IPCM 

approach does not help when one wants to evaluate the influence of a solvent polarity on electronic 

characteristics of ATI. In both cases, deprotonated and protonated ATI, the IPCM approach gives 

practically the same values of aiso(N2) as in the gas phase. Thus, the IPCM method cannot help in 

simulation of a water-induced rise of aiso(N2) that was, however, successfully computed by means 

of the obvious consideration of a water environment.

CONCLUDING REMARKS 

The main question of this work has been formulated as follows: how many water molecules 

should  be  considered  for  an  adequate  simulation  of  the  first  hydration  sphere  around  a  spin  label 
ATI? Investigating how structural and energy parameters of a cluster ATI(Н+)−(H2O)n depend on 

the number of water molecules, we came to the conclusion that a water cluster of 

n

 ≥ 40 water 

OH 2

molecules can be considered as an appropriate model for a complete aqueous shell around ATI. In a 

reasonable agreement with experimental data, calculated electron spin density on the nitrogen atom 

of the nitroxide fragment increased with a stepwise surrounding of a spin label molecule with water. 

Hydration  of  a  spin  label  caused  certain  changes  in  its  geometric  parameters  -  bond  lengths  and 

angles. However, it was demonstrated, it is the water-induced polarisation effect rather than changes 

in a spin label geometry that caused the increase in the isotropic splitting constant aiso(N2).  

Calculating the energy characteristics of ATI molecule surrounded by water, we came to the 

conclusion that ATI protonation occurs at the nitrogen atom of the imidazoline ring rather than at 

the amine group. Having the energy diagram for hydrated ATI molecule (Fig. 3B, compare energy 
levels for states ATI(H+)−H3O+(H2O)41 and ATI−H3O+(H2O)40), it might be interesing to evaluate 

the pK value of ATI. However, a correct solution of this task is obscured by significant scattering of 
calculated  energy  levels,  which  depend,  in  particular,  on  the  H3O+  ion  position  in  the  hydrogen-

bonded  network  of  water  molecules  around  ATI.  According  to  our  calculations,  the  energy 

fluctuations could reach ac. 10 kcal/mol (detailed analysis of energy fluctuations in this system will 

be published elsewhere). 

Computations of spin density partitioning on the atoms of deprotonated and protonated ATI 

molecules  in  the  gas  phase  or  surrounded  by  41  water  molecules  (Fig. 8)  are  in  a  fair  agreement 

with  experimental  data  concerning  the  changes  in  the  hyperfine  splitting  constant  with  ATI 

protonation  and  hydration.  Our  calculations  of  the  isotropic  hyperfine  constant  predicted  a  water-

induced increase in aiso(N2) as ∆aiso(N2) = 2-2.5 G, which is typical of nitroxide radicals. However, 

the  absolute  aiso(N2)  values  calculated  for  hydrated  ATI  molecule  is  lower  (ac.  1.8-2.6 G, 

depending  on  the  computation  level)  than  experimentally  measured  constant  aiso(N2)  =  15.0 G 

(Table  5).  Certain  shortcomings  in  computations  of  aiso(N2)  arise  from  a  high  sensitivity  of 

calculated  spin  densities  at  nuclei  to  a  choice  of  the  basis  set.  One  might  expect  that  proper 

corrections  for  the  vibrational  modulations  of  aiso(N2),  as  well  as  a  consideration  of  a  greater 

number  of  water  molecules  surrounding  ATI,  should  lead  to  much  more  accurate  values  of 

calculated aiso(N2). We hope that further progress in computational chemistry will help to overcome 

the problem of accurate calculations of EPR parameters of spin labels.

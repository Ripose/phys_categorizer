ABSTRACT 

By integrating the full Maxwell’s equations we predict the existence of gap solitons in a 

quadratic, Fabry-Perot negative index cavity. An intense, fundamental pump pulse shifts 

the  band  structure  that  forms  when  magnetic  and  electric  plasma  frequencies  are 

different, so that a weak, second harmonic pulse initially tuned inside the gap is almost 

entirely transmitted. The process is due cascading, which occurs far from phase matching 

conditions,  and  causes  pulse  compression.  A  nonlinear  polarization  spawns  a  dark 

soliton, while a nonlinear magnetization produces a bright soliton.

The  term  "gap  soliton"  was  coined  to  describe  the  shape  that  the  electric  field 

 

 

1 

assumes when an incident, continuous wave beam is tuned inside the photonic band gap 

of  a  one-dimensional,  periodic  structure  of  finite  length,  so  that  a  third  order  (χ(3)) 

nonlinearity causes the beam to be transmitted  [1].  The physics of how such a state may 

be  excited  is  exceptionally  simple:  a  nonlinear  change  in  the  intensity-dependent 

refractive index of at least one of the constituent materials causes a shift of the photonic 

band  edge,  thus  placing  the  incident  beam  within  the  pass  band,  and  allowing  its 

transmission. An excellent review of third order gap solitons may be found in reference 

[2].    Transverse,  diffractive  spatial  gap  solitons  have  been  predicted  in  quadratic  (χ(2)) 

materials in the context of multilayer structures [3], and are generally due to cascading, a 

process  that  occurs  when  pump  and  second  harmonic  beams  interact  far  from  phase 

matching conditions. Temporal, two-color gap solitons were also predicted in quadratic, 

shallow-depth Bragg gratings [4], and typically rely on doubly resonant conditions, and 

strong  coupling  between  the  fundamental  (FF)  and  second  harmonic  (SH)  beams.  The 

recent  interest  in  negative  index  materials  (NIMs)  [5]  has  led  to  predictions  of  χ(3)  gap 

solitons [6] near the band edge of the intrinsic gap of a Fabry-Perot, NIM cavity [7] in the 

form of a single slab of material immersed in vacuum.  Unlike the zero average-index gap 

[8], formation of the intrinsic band structure does not require the presence of a positive 

index  material  (PIM),  and  it  is  a  peculiarity  of  the  frequency  range  where  a  NIM  has 

dielectric  susceptibility  and  magnetic  permeability  of  opposite  signs  [7]. 

  The 

peculiarities of the band structure extend to the field localization properties, which appear 

to be unique even for a single slab of material [6, 7].   

 

In this Letter we report second harmonic gap solitons in a χ(2)-active NIM etalon.  

For  a  positive  nonlinear  coefficient,  one  may  excite  either  a  dark  or  a  bright  soliton, 

2 

depending on whether an electric or magnetic nonlinearity is present. As is well-known in 

the case of ordinary PIMs, the FF and SH fields do not exchange energy if the relative 

phase difference between the incident fields is chosen so that the interaction proceeds far 

from  the  phase  matching  condition,  thus  triggering  cascading,  and  the  interaction 

resembles a χ(3) process.  In a NIM etalon, the formation of a gap soliton at the second 

harmonic  frequency  follows  a  similar  pattern,  with  some  distinguishing  characteristics.  

An  intense  FF  pulse  is  tuned  to  the  first  resonance,  on  the  low  frequency  side  of  the 

intrinsic band gap, where the index of refraction is negative, and it is mostly transmitted.  

Although we choose the FF to be resonant, it is not a necessary condition but it helps to 

lower the nonlinear thresholds.  A much weaker SH pulse is then tuned inside the gap, 

where  the  index  of  refraction  is  near  zero  (n~10-3),  in  proximity  of  the  high  frequency 

band edge, so that in the absence of nonlinear coupling it is  mostly  reflected. Then, by 

properly  adjusting  the  relative  input  phase  difference  between  the  fields,  the  SH  pulse 

experiences no net gain, causing a dynamic shift of the band edge.  As a result, the SH 

pulse is effectively pushed out of the band gap, it is spatially and temporally compressed, 

and almost completely transmitted: transmittance switches from 4% to about 90%.  

 

 

To model the dynamics of interacting, short pulses in a NIM cavity we begin by 

writing  nonlinear,  second  order  polarization  and  magnetization  as

Eqs.(3) contain no approximations other than the assumption that the medium is 

isotropic,  and  that  higher  order  material  dispersion  terms  may  be  neglected.  The  latter 

point  can  easily  be  justified,  since  we  are  considering  a  material  only  two  wavelengths 

thick.    We  note  that  in  NIMs  typical  higher  order  dispersion  lengths  range  from  a  few 

tens  [11]  to  a  few  thousand  wavelengths,  and  that  the  neglect  of  higher  order,  material 

dispersion terms does not necessarily restrict the envelope functions to be slowly varying 

in  time.  Eqs.(3)  thus  provide  a  very  accurate  physical  picture  of  the  dynamics  even  for 

pulses down to just a few wave cycles in  duration [9, 10]. These observations are fully 

confirmed by integrating the full Maxwell equations coupled to a set of driven, nonlinear 

oscillators,  which  we  perform  using  a  finite  difference,  time  domain  integration 

technique, yielding identical results. 

 

The intrinsic band gap, the relative tuning of the FF and SH fields, and the index 

of  refraction  are  depicted  in  Fig.(1),  given  a  Drude  model  with  the  following

 are the scaled electric and magnetic plasma frequencies, respectively, and 

γ(cid:4)   is  the  scaled  damping  coefficient.  As  a  representative  example,  we  choose

reference  wavelength.    Although  it  is  never  explicitly  invoked  in  the  integrations  of 

Maxwell's  equations, 

the 

index  of  refraction  may  be  retrieved  as  usual, 

i.e.

(cid:4)

,  and  the  negative  root  is  chosen  when  both  ε  and  μ  are 

simultaneously  negative  [5].  Our    choice  of  γ(cid:4)   corresponds  to  an  absorption  length  of 

approximately 500 microns for the pump, and ten times larger for the SH pulse, so that 

neither are appreciably attenuated, as the transmittance curve of Fig.(1) shows. However, 

our calculations show that the soliton does not loose its coherence with the introduction 

of  more  significant  absorption,  whose  presence,  in  fact,  tends  to  simply  raise  the 

nonlinear thresholds. For example, taking 

310γ
−
=(cid:4)

, which corresponds to an absorption 

length of ~50μm, causes the transmittance of the FF to drop to ~77%.  Our calculations 

show that this loss may be compensated by a ~30% increase in the peak intensity of the 

FF pulse. 

 

Unlike  the  damping  coefficient,  Mω(cid:4)

  and 

Eω(cid:4)   contain  more  subtleties,  primarily 

because  their  relative  magnitudes  determine  how  the  fields  will  become  localized  [7].  

We note that experimentally,  Mω(cid:4)

 and 

Eω(cid:4)  may be set by properly engineering the size of 

the elemental, split-ring resonator circuit [12], or by properly managing the geometry of 

the  various  components  [13].    Then,  our  choice  of  smaller  electric  plasma  frequency 

causes  the  electric  field  to  become  highly  localized  (a  single  maximum)  at  the  low 

frequency band edge, and anti-localized (a single minimum) at the high frequency band 

edge, near the second harmonic frequency.  Exchanging the values of  Mω(cid:4)

 and  

Eω(cid:4)  causes 

the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  to  trade  roles,  as  an  analysis  of  Eqs.(3)  suggests.  

Consequently, the nonlinear polarization generates anti-localized, dark gap solitons, and a 

nonlinear magnetization induces localized, bright, gap solitons.  In Fig.(2) we show the 

anti-localized  and  localized  states  that  respectively  correspond  to  the  excitation  of  dark 

6 

and  bright  solitons,  for  a  SH  frequency  tuned  near  the  high  frequency  band  edge 

resonance.  In Fig.(3) we depict the energy contained in the SH pulse as a function of the 

relative input phase difference between the two incident pulses, normalized in units of the 

incident, SH energy.  When δϕ~10.5o, the energy exchanged between the fields amounts 

to less than one part in a thousand.  The temporal dynamics of the integrated SH energy 

that corresponds to δϕ = 10.5o is shown in Fig.(4).  Each point on the curves of Fig.(3) 

was  obtained  using  incident  pulses  approximately  1ps  in  duration,  or  about  200  optical 

cycles;  the  intensity  of  the  FF  (~100MW/cm2)  is  approximately  2x105  greater  than  the 

SH  peak  intensity,  so  that  the  FF  field  propagates  undisturbed;  and

Mχ = .  In Fig.(5) we show incident and scattered SH pulse intensities, normalized to 

0

incident peak intensity.  The figure reveals that in addition to being mostly transmitted, 

the pulse is compressed by ~30%.  One should contrast these results with linear behavior, 

i.e. Fig.(1), where we obtain ~4% transmission. Both these aspects of the dynamics, i.e., 

high  transmittance  and  pulse  compression,  along  with  the  fields  shown  in  Fig.(2),  are 

fully  consistent  with  soliton-like  behavior,  as  observed  experimentally  in  the  case  of  a 

soliton that forms and propagates near the band edge of a fiber Bragg grating [14].    

 

The  dynamics  that  we  have  described  depend  on  a  number  of  factors.    For 

instance,  the  curves  of  Fig.(3)  are  sensitive  not  only  to  initial  relative  phase  difference, 

but  also  to  peak  pulse  intensities.    Because  of  this  sensitivity,  pulse  duration  is  also 

important, as pulse bandwidth determines the degree of localization light achieves inside 

the  etalon.    Thus  the  kind  of  gap  soliton  that  we  report  persists  well  into  the  sub-

picosecond  regime,  and  as  we  have  seen  even  when  absorption  is  present,  albeit  with 

relatively higher nonlinear thresholds.  

7 

 

In  conclusion,  we  report  SH  bright  and  dark  gap  solitons  in  a  2-μm  thick, 

nonlinear,  quadratic,  Fabry-Perot  cavity.  The  relative  phase  difference  between  the 

incident  fields  is  chosen  to  induce  cascading  processes  and  a  dynamic  shift  of  the 

intrinsic band edge that causes pulse compression and gap soliton formation. The soliton 

is  relatively  impervious  to  the  introduction  of  absorption  and  the  reduction  of  pulse 

width. These findings are relevant in the optical regime, as negative index materials are 

actually being fabricated in the near IR region [13], with good prospects for devices in 

the visible part of the spectrum. We thus hope that our results, which take into account 

effects  of  finite  size  and  material  absorption,  will  further  stimulate  research  in  this 

direction.  Finally, we also note that gap solitons at the fundamental frequency may also 

be  created  using  a  negative  nonlinear  coefficient,  and  by  reversing  the  roles  and 

intensities of the SH and FF pulses.

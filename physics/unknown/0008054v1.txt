Abstract

Radio frequency (RF) windows are historically a point
where  failure  occurs  in  input-power  couplers  for
accelerators. To understand more about the reliability of
high power RF windows, lifetime testing was done on 700
MHz  coaxial  RF  windows  for  the  Low  Energy
Demonstration  Accelerator  (LEDA)  project  of  the
Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) program. The RF
windows,  made  by  Marconi  Applied  Technologies
(formerly EEV), were tested at 800 kW for an extended
period of time. Changes in the reflected power, vacuum,
air  outlet  temperature,  and  surface  temperature  were
monitored  over  time.  The  results  of  the  life  testing  are
summarized.

1  INTRODUCTION

A lifetime window test stand has been set up to learn
more  about  the  failure  mechanisms  and  lifetime  of  RF
windows for the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT)
program.  Two  700 MHz RF windows prototypes were
ordered from the vendor, Marconi Applied Technologies
and were conditioned in less than 20 hours and then tested
to  800  kW  for  4  hours.  Based  on  these  test  results,  14
additional  windows  were  ordered  for  window  life  time
testing. Due to problems encountered with the initial high
power  testing  of  these  additional  windows,  not  as  much
life time test data was collected as planned. Two windows
were tested for 245 hours and 155,513 kW hours on the
stand. The other windows that were life tested for less time
encountered various problems . This paper summarizes the
life data obtained on the two windows which ran for an
extended  period  of  time,  and  it  also  summarizes  the
problems encountered with the other windows.

2  EXPERIMENTAL  APPARATUS

AND  PROCEDURE

2.1  Window Geometry

The windows are a coaxial geometry using an AL995
alumina  ceramic.  As  shown  in  Figure  1,  the  window
assembly  consists  of  1/2  WR  1150  waveguide  on  the
vacuum side,  a T-Bar transition into the coaxial region of
the alumina ceramic, and another T-Bar to transition to full
height  WR  1500  waveguide  on  the  air  side.    The
configuration shown in Figure 1 is referred to as a right
handed  configuration.  The  air  side  waveguide  may  be
rotated 180 degrees around the axis of the coax to yield a

left handed configuration. Both the right handed and the left
handed  configurations  are  used  to  feed  power  to  the
CCDTL  on  the  APT  accelerator.  The  vacuum  side
waveguide is copper plated stainless steel. The inner and
outer  coax  is  copper  and  the  air  side  waveguide  is
aluminum.

The windows are cooled with 40 CFM of air cooling and
2 GPM of water cooling. The air inlet is on the air side T
bar. The air then flows through the T bar on the air side,
down  the  inner  conductor,  and  then  exits  the  inner
conductor through a series of exit holes and flows across
the  alumina  ceramic.  The  air  exits  the  coaxial  region
through a series of exit holes on the outer conductor and is
vented  to  the  ambient  environment.    The  water  circuit
cools  the  vacuum  side  T  bar  region  and  the  vacuum
waveguide.

2.2 Test Stand Description

The test stand was designed to test up to eight windows
in series into a matched load. The windows are set up in
pairs in a back to back configuration with a section of 1/2
height WR 1150 waveguide between them. Each window
pair is isolated by a pair of waveguide switches, so in the
event  of  a  window  problem,  the  affected  pair  can  be
isolated and the RF testing can continue.  The test stand is
capable of passing 1 MW CW RF power. The test stand is
configured so it may be operated remotely because it is in
the  beam  tunnel  for  the  Low  Energy  Demonstration
Accelerator  (LEDA)  and  access  is  not  permitted  when
LEDA is producing beam.
2.3 Diagnostic Equipment

The RF window test stand includes many diagnostics.
The vacuum pressure is measured at three places in each

window pair and is interlocked with the RF power. The
pressure  at  which  the  interlock  is  set  may  be  adjusted
during testing. Each RF window has two fiber optic arc
detectors, one on the air side and one on the vacuum side.
The arc detectors are also interlocked with the RF power
and  will  shut  off  the  RF  power  for  1.6  seconds  upon
detection  of  an  arc.    An  analog  voltage  is  displayed
corresponding  to  the  intensity  of  light  detected.  This
voltage is used to detect a window that may not be arcing,
but instead displaying a low intensity glow. The water, air
inlet  and  air  exit  temperatures  are  monitored  and
interlocked  with  the  RF  power.  In  addition,  the
temperature of the outer coax in the region of the ceramic
is  also  monitored  and  recorded.  The  position  of  the
waveguide  switches  are  interlocked.  If  the  position  of  a
waveguide switch is changed during testing, the RF power
is shut off. If the switches in a given pair are not set in the
same  position,  the  RF  power  is  also  disabled.      A
LabView® program is used to record and archive the outer
coaxial    and  air  outlet  temperatures,  vacuum  pressure,
number of arcs, and RF power. A DataHighway® system
is used to link information from the window test stand in
the  beam  tunnel  to  information  at  the  klystron  used  to
provide RF power to the test stand. An EPICS interface
has been set up to remotely operate the test stand and the
klystron and to archive the data.

3  EXPERIMENTAL  RESULTS

3.1 Initial High Power Acceptance Test Results

When the windows first arrive at LANL they undergo
high  power  acceptance  testing.  This  testing  consists  of
conditioning the windows to 800 kW and then running at
800  kW  for  4  hours.  Once  they  pass  the  high  power
acceptance tests, the windows are then moved to the life
test    stand.  This  section  summarizes  the  results  of  the
initial high power acceptance testing.

Fourteen additional windows were ordered from EEV.
So far, a total of nineteen windows have been received at
LANL. Of these nineteen windows, six windows passed
the high power acceptance tests. Of the six windows, two
developed vacuum leaks and two were sent back to EEV to
have  additional  water  cooling  added  in  the  area  of  the
vacuum  side  T  bar  because  of  high  temperatures  in  this
region. The remaining two windows, serial #12 and #13,
are on the life test stand at this time. Three windows arced
excessively and were sent back to EEV.  Four windows
showed glowing and/or heating problems, and all four of
these  windows  were  grit  blasted.  Two  of  the  four  then
passed the high power acceptance tests, however, they later
developed vacuum leaks. The third of the four windows
broke after grit blasting and the fourth window was sent
back to EEV for additional cooling modifications. Another
window developed a vacuum leak on a Conflat® flange.
This information is summarized in Table 1.

Currently the RF windows have undergone 408.14 MW
hours  of  life  time  testing.    The  breakdown  for  the  total
number  of  MW  hours  is  summarized  in  Table  2.  Serial
#04 and #06 were removed in April and sent back to the
vendor to have the additional cooling modifications added
in  the  T-bar  region.  Serial  #09  and  #11  both  developed
vacuum leaks in the T-bar region and were sent back to the
vendor as well. Thus, most of the life time test data has
been acquired on Serial #12 and #13.

Figure 2. Steady State Temperature vs. Power

The steady state temperatures of the outer coaxial surface
at  various  power  levels  are  shown  in  Figure  2.  These
temperatures are on windows that did not show any arcing,
glowing  or  heating  problems.  During  the  high  power
acceptance  testing  the  temperatures  of  the  windows  are
compared to this data as a tool to indicate any problems.

The variations in the coaxial surface temperature, air out
temperature, amount of arcing, and vacuum pressure are
examined  over  time.  As  shown  in  Figure  3,  the  coaxial
surface  temperature  is  plotted  at  various  power  levels
during  each  month  for  serial  numbers  12  and  13.    As
expected from Figure 2, the average temperature increases
with the average power, however, there is no correlation of
temperature,  either  increasing  or  decreasing  with  time.
Figure  4  shows  no  correlation  between  the  air  out
temperature and test time; however, the noticeable increase
in the air out temperature with power can be easily seen.
The vacuum pressure remained very constant throughout
the testing and there were no significant number of arcs.

The  problems  encountered  in  the  initial  high  power
testing include an air cooling problem, shipping damage,
vacuum leaks, arcing, and  glowing and/or heating. The air

cooling problem was caused by inadequate air flow due to a
mis-adjusted  orifice.  This  cooling  problem  is  easily
explainable and fixed. The shipping damage is also easily
explained. The interesting problems are the vacuum leaks,
glowing and/or heating, and arcing.  The vacuum leaks in
the region of the T-bar are thought to be unrelated to the
glowing or the grit blasting. The leaks are thought to be
due to high stresses caused by a large thermal gradient in
the  region  of  the  T-bar.  This  problem  was  corrected  by
adding a copper insert and additional cooling in the region
of  the  T  bar.  One  window  had  a  vacuum  leak  on  a
Conflat®  flange  which  was  due  to  a  poor  weld.    The
glowing and/or heating and arcing are caused by surface
contaminates and or defects[1]. The glowing and heating
are grouped together because if one problem is seen, the
other one usually accompanies it. The glow is a blue or
purple  color  and  the  window  temperatures  are  10  to  20
degrees  Celsius  higher.  The  temperature  rise  and  the
optical  emission  are  indicators  multipacting[2,3].    If  a
significant glow occurs, an analog voltage can be indicated
on the arc detectors. The intensity of the glow increases
with the RF power level. Windows that are arcing usually
exhibit  a  very  good  vacuum  and  do  not  display  higher
temperatures than normal.

After  the  current  amount  of  life  testing,  no  definitive
conclusions can be made about the lifetime of the window
because  there  were  no  trends  in  the  surface  and  air
temperatures,  the  amount  of  arcing,  or  the  vacuum
pressure with time. Some improvements were made in the
thermal  mechanical  design  of  the  window  by  adding
additional cooling. Making the vacuum side waveguide out
of  copper  would  be  a  design  improvement  because
increasing  in  conductivity  would  improve  the  thermal
mechanical properties of the window.

5  CONCLUSIONS

Unknown  variables  about  manufacturing  and  surface
preparation processes have led to a low initial high power
testing success rate. Other problems encountered (i.e., air
cooling problem, shipping damage, vacuum leaks) can be
corrected  and/or  fixed.  More  life  test  data  is  needed  to
determine the life time of the windows

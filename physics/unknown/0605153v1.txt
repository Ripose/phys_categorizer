We  discover  that  at  the  edge  of  optical  lattice  imprinted  in  saturable  nonlinear  media 

one-dimensional  surface  solitons  exist  only  within  a  band  of  light  intensities,  and  that 

they  cease  to  exist  when  the  lattice  depth  exceeds  an  upper  threshold.  We  also  reveal 

the  generation  of  arrays  of  two-dimensional  surface  solitons  mediated  by  transverse 

modulational  instability  of  one-dimensional  solitons,  a  process  that  is  found  to  exhibit 

specific features associated to properties of the optical lattice.

The presence of interfaces between linear and nonlinear materials strongly affects 

propagation of intense laser beams [1-3]. Such interfaces can support solitons localized at 

the very interface. Until recently, progress in experimental observation of surface solitons 

has  been  limited  by  the  huge  powers  required  for  their  excitation  at  the  interfaces  of 

natural  materials.  Thus,  surface  solitons  were  observed  only  at  interfaces  of  linear  and 

photorefractive  media  [4]  and  at  the  interface  with  linear  layered  media  [5].  Recently, 

the concept of surface solitons in semi-infinite cubic waveguide arrays was proposed [6-

8], that resulted in prediction and observation of new types of surface solitons [9,10]. All 

such  solitons  observed  to  date  are  one-dimensional.  However,  the  technique  of  optical 

induction [11-14] allows creation of truly two-dimensional periodic interfaces. Solitons at 

such interfaces have never been addressed so far. 

 

In this Letter we study the properties of solitons supported by the interface of an 

optical  lattice  with  saturable  nonlinearity  and  a  linear  medium.  We  find  that  in  such 

setting one-dimensional (1D) surface solitons exist only inside a band of light intensities, 

and  that  they  cease  to  exist  when  the  lattice  depth  exceeds  a  critical  value,  the  latter 

being  a  new  effect  arising  due  to  the  competition  between  nonlinearity  saturation  and 

surface effects. 1D solitons are prone to transverse modulational instabilities, previously

studied  for  interfaces  of  uniform  media  [15-17],  which  may  generate  arrays  of  bulk,  or 

two-dimensional (2D) surface solitons. Here we explore such process, for the first time to 

our knowledge, for solitons arrays generated at the edge of an optical lattice. 

We consider the propagation of light along the  ξ  axis of a biased photorefractive 

crystal. A pair of interfering plane waves induces a periodic refractive index modulation 

along 

η

 axis,  while  along  second  transverse  ζ  axis  the  refractive  index  is  uniform.  An 

intense green-light background illumination may be used to produce a region with high 

photoconductivity where red-light imprinted lattice is erased, thus creating an interface 

between  a  periodic  nonlinear  medium  and  a  uniform  linear  medium.  The  transition 

region can be made sharp by blocking the background wave in the space  η

0>

, so that 

diffraction is negligible on the scale of tenths of soliton widths. We assume that soliton 

beam and interface-creating waves are orthogonally polarized to each other. In this case 

the complex amplitude of the light field evolves according to:

There are two simplest types of surface solitons: odd (centered in the nearest to 

interface  lattice  channel)  and  even  (centered  between  the  first  and  second  lattice 

channels) as shown in Fig. 1. The dependence of energy flow on propagation constant for 

odd  and  even  solitons  is  depicted  in  Fig.  2(a).  In  the  low-energy  limit,  surface  solitons 

acquire pronounced shape modulations and tend to penetrate deep into the lattice region 

(Figs.  1(a),1(b)).  Such  solitons  exist  only  above  a  power  threshold,  similarly  to  surface 

solitons in cubic lattices. With increase of U  (or b ) the center of odd soliton gradually 

shifts toward the first lattice minimum, while soliton itself becomes well-localized (Figs. 

1(c)  and  1(d)).  Thus,  the  interface  effectively  repels  high-energy  solitons.  This  is  in 

contrast to surfaces in cubic media, where energy concentrates in first lattice channel as 

b →

∞

. Due to such repulsion, surface solitons can exist in the first lattice channel only 

below a threshold energy flow. In the presence of saturation surface solitons exist inside 

a  band  of  energy  flows  or  propagation  constants  (see  Fig.  2(a)).  In  the  lower b

 and 

low

upper b

upp

 cutoffs profiles of odd and even solitons coincide. We discovered that surface 

solitons  at  saturable  interfaces  cease  to  exist  when  p  exceeds  a  critical  value  p  (Fig. 

cr

2(b)).  Thus,  at  E

10=

 one  has 

≈

4.01

.  A  similar  behavior  was  encountered  for 

crp

other  values  of  the  biasing  static  field  E .  The  existence  domain  is  found  to  shrink  at 

E =

crE

 (Fig.  2(c)),  while  with  increase  of  E  the  range  of  accessible  energy  flows  of

surface  waves  increases.  We  found  a  qualitatively  similar  behavior  for  other  types  of 

saturable interfaces, indicating a universality of this phenomenon. 

Linear stability analysis indicates that odd surface solitons are stable with respect 

to  one-dimensional  perturbations  (

Ω =

0)

,  except  for  narrow  regions  near  lower  and 

upper cutoffs where dU

/

db ≤

0

 (Fig. 2(d)). At the same time, even solitons happen to 

be  unstable  in  the  entire  domain  of  their  existence.  The  perturbation  growth  rates  for 

odd and even surface solitons coincide at the boundaries of existence domain. 

The central issue addressed in this Letter is the evolution of the 1D solitons when 

higher-dimensional dynamics along the transverse coordinate  ζ  is included. In this case, 

development of transverse modulational instability (TMI) of surface wave stripe along  ζ  

may result in formation of 2D soliton arrays. To elucidate the specific features of TMI at 

interfaces  with  lattice,  we  calculated  the  growth  rates  for  odd  and  even  solitons  at 

modulation  frequencies  Ω

0>

 (Fig.  3).  All  instabilities  that  were  encountered  are  of 

exponential type. Growth rate is nonzero only within a finite frequency band:  δ  vanishes 

for odd solitons and remains nonzero for even solitons when  Ω → . 

0

Direct integration of Eq. (1) enables to determine which structures emerge in the 

developed 

stage  of  TMI.  We 

solved  Eq. 

(1)  with 

the 

input  conditions

(

Ω ) ,  where  u v

,

w(cid:19)

 are  obtained  from  Eq.  (2).  Thus,  input 

field  distributions  are  bright  near-surface  stripes  localized  along  η  axis,  and  are  only 

slightly  modulated  along  ζ  axis.  Three  typical  regimes  were  encountered.  For  small 

modulation frequencies, when energy concentrated within one filament with scale 2

/π Ω

 

(along  ζ  axis)  substantially  exceeds  energy  necessary  for  excitation  of  2D  solitons,  the 

1D surface waves break into many fragments (Fig. 4(a)), that either move away of the 

surface or form sets of 2D surface waves. The specific feature of TMI at the interface is 

that decay may be accompanied by strong radiation emission into the lattice, but almost 

no radiation penetrates into the linear medium. Importantly, the interface repels beams 

with too high or too low energy flows, consistent with limited existence domain in U  for 

surface solitons and only filaments with proper energy remain in the vicinity of interface. 

A second important regime is encountered when energy flow within one filament 

is of the same order as the energy required for formation of a single 2D surface soliton. 

In this case, after some transient regime accompanied by radiation (Fig. 4(b)) an array 

of localized 2D surface solitons is formed. Under suitable conditions, this regime occurs 

 

4

for modulation frequency yielding the maximal growth rate. A third regime occurs when 

energy concentrated within one filament is not high enough for formation of 2D surface 

wave. This typically happens close to the high-frequency edge of the instability domain. 

Then, a shallow modulation of surface wave occurs, without wave break-up (Fig. 4(c)). 

Simulations show that arrays of well-localized 2D surface waves emerging due to TMI of 

1D waves are robust and may propagate undistorted over huge distances (e.g., the array 

depicted in Fig. 4(b) keeps its structure for more than 10  propagation units, exceeding 

4

any  experimentally  feasible  crystal  lengths  by  several  orders  of  magnitude).  By  tuning 

the  energy  flow  of  input  quasi-1D  waves  and  frequency  of  transverse  modulation  one 

may generate arrays with various separations between neighboring spots along  ζ  axis. 

 

We  thus  conclude  by  stressing  that  we  introduced  the  properties  of  solitons 

attached at the surface of a lattice imprinted in media with saturable nonlinearity. The 

existence conditions of such solitons exhibit new threshold effects versus energy flow and 

lattice  depth.  We  showed  how  transverse  modulational  instabilities  of  one-dimensional 

solitons lead to the generation of robust two-dimensional surface solitons arrays.

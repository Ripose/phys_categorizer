Abstract 
     Los  Alamos  National  Laboratory  (LANL) 
is 
designing  a  coupled  cavity  linac  (CCL)  for  the 
Spallation  Neutron  Source  (SNS)  being  built  at  Oak 
Ridge  National  Laboratory  (ORNL).    As  part  of  the 
design process, a proto-type, Hot Model, consisting of 
two segments of the SNS CCL was manufactured and 
installed  at  LANL.    An  RF  source  was  applied  to  the 
Hot  Model  to  determine  the  success  of  the  cavity 
design, the effectiveness of the control algorithms and 
cooling  systems,  and  the  validity  of  the  Resonance 
Control  Cooling  System  (RCCS)  model  used  during 
the  Hot  Model  design.    From  a  system  controls 
the  hot  model,  a 
perspective,  an  overview  of 
description  of  the  RCCS,  and  the  pertinent  data  from 
the RF tests will be presented. 

1 THE CCL HOT MODEL 
The Hot Model is an experimental proto-type of the 
first two segments of the SNS CCL, and its associated 
subsystems.  These sub systems include water cooling 
and  control,  vacuum,  RF,  and  hardware  system 
control.  The water cooled components of the CCL are 
the  copper  cavities,  the  short  coupling  cells  between 
cavities  (CCC),  and  one  long  coupling  cell  (LCC) 
between the two CCL segments.  Each of the segments 
contains eight cavities with their corresponding CCCs. 
The desired resonant frequency of the CCL cavities 
is 805.0 MHz.  Under normal operation approximately 
70%  of  the  RF  Power  is dissipated in the CCL cavity 
walls.    For  a  CCL,  electromagnetic  field  resonant 
frequency  is  primarily  a  function  of  the  geometry  of 
the  cavities,  side  coupling  cells,  and  bridge  couplers.  
As  RF  power  is  dissipated  in  the  cavity  wall,  the 
copper  wall  will  heat,  then  expand,  and  it’s  resonant 
frequency  will  decrease.    This  frequency  shift  will  be 
controlled  by  introducing  an  opposing  frequency  shift 
in  the  cavity  design  and  a  closed  loop  cavity  cooling 
system. 

 The  CCL  cavities  have  been  designed  and  will  be 
manufactured  and  pre-tuned 
to  have  a  resonant 
frequency of 805.140 MHz with 20˚C coolant flowing 
through the structure surrounding the RF cavity and no 
RF heating.  On the back of the copper structure from

which  the  CCL  cavity  is  machined,  there  will  be  four 
parallel annular paths around the cavity nose (see Fig. 
1).    These  paths  will  be  fed  and  collected  by  internal 
plenums.    The  internal  plenums  will  be  connected  to 
supply and return manifolds that are in turn connected 
to  a  water  supply,  cooling,  and  control  system.

 2 RESONANCE CONTROL 
  The  RCCS  removes  waste  heat  from  the  copper 
structure  around  the  CCL  RF  cavities  and  maintains 
resonance  within 
through  active 
temperature  control.    The  importance  of  maintaining 
the CCL resonant frequency is that it provides for the 
efficient acceleration of the proton beam with minimal

 2.1  Hot Model/RCCS Layout 

The  water  cooling  system  for  the  CCL  consists  of 
four  main  components;  the  RF  structure,  transition 
plumbing,  a  water  skid,  and  a  facility  chilled  water 
source.    A  generalized  schematic  for  the  RCCS 
configuration  is  shown  in  Figure  2.    The  cooling 
features  of  the  Hot  Model  RF  structure  consist  of  a 
three  main  paths;  one  for  each  of  the  cavity  coupling 
cells, one for each of the cavities, and one for the long 
coupling cell. The CCC path enters on the side of the 
coupling cell from the inlet manifold and flows around 
the  circumference  of  the  cell  and  exits  on  the  side  of 
the  outlet  manifold..    Each  of  these  paths  removes 
approximately 500W/cell of waste heat.  Similarly, the 
cavity  path  enters  then  branches  into  four  parallel 
annular paths on the back side of the RF cavity.  This 
path 
the  waste  heat 
removes

skid  is  a  self-contained  unit  with  all  of  the  necessary 
plumbing,  water 
and

water at a desired temperature and constant flow rate to 
the CCL RF structure. [1]

2.2  Control Scheme 

The  RCCS  control  scheme  is  to  maintain  the  water 
temperature  in  the  flow  loop  supplied  to  the  RF 
structure such that resonance can be maintained in the 
RF cavities.  The water temperature in the flow loop is 
manipulated  by  adjusting  the  proportion  of  hot  water 
returning  from  the  CCL  that  is  diverted  through  the 
water  skid  heat  exchanger.    The  mechanism  for  this 
manipulation  is  a  “3-Way”  control  valve,  whose 
is  calculated  via  a  multi-mode 
control  effort 
Proportional, 
(PID)  control 
Integral,  Derivative 
algorithm.    All  of  the  instrumentation/control  for  the 
Hot Model was implemented via a PC system running 
LabVIEW®  and  integrated  to  the  hardware/sensors 
using Field Point®. 

For  the  Hot  Model,  the  multimode  PID  algorithm 
consisted of manual, temperature feedback (TFB), and 
RF error feedback (RFEFB) modes.  The manual mode 
allowed  an  operator  to  position  the  control  valve  by 
entering  values  manually  into  a  LabVIEW®    screen.  
Manual  mode  served  as  a  startup,  maintenance,  and 
override  feature,  rather  than  a  mode  for  normal 
operation.  The RFEFB mode was intended  for normal 
operation,  to  control  resonance  under  RF  Power 
fluctuations.  The TFB mode was used during the loss 
of  RF  power,  and  to  preheat  or  maintain  the  cavities 
temperatures  close  to  their  resonant  temperatures 
during RF loss. 

The RF error is a measure of how far off the cavity 
RF  is  from  resonance.    The  RF  error  signal  is 
calculated using a moving average of the reflected RF 
power.    Whenever  the  reflected  power  is  measured  at 
zero,  i.e.  the  cavity  is  in  resonance  or  there  is  no 
power, the RF error signal is 5.9V.  Hence, 5.9V is the 
set  point  for  the  PID  feedback  loop  when  in  RFEFB 
mode.  A dead band of oscillations about the resonance 
frequency of 805.0 MHz (5.9V) of +/-10kHz (+/-0.3V) 
is specified for the SNS CCL.[2] 

In  the  event  of  RF  power  failure  or  trip,  hence,  the 
loss  of  heat  load  to  the  water  cooling  system,  the 
control  mode  must  be  switched  from  RFEFB  to  TFB 
mode.  This transition is necessary, since the RF error 
signal is forced to the set point in the event RF power 
is  lost.    With  the  process  variable  at  the  set  point,  all 
control  effort  goes 
the 
to  zero 
temperature  of  the  cavities.    In  the  case  where  RF 
power has been lost, the control valve would remain at 
its  current  position,  and  the  temperature  of  the  RF 
cavity  would  begin  to  decrease  due  to  the  loss  of  the 
RF  heat  load.    The  motivation  for  switching  to  TFB 

regardless  of 

mode is to keep the temperature of the cavities as close 
as  possible  to  the  temperature  for  which  its  resonant 
dimensions  are  achieved.    Hence,  there  is  little  time 
lost returning to resonance once RF power is restored.  
While in TFB mode, the desired temperature to use 
as  the  process  variable  would  have  been  the  actual 
cavity  temperature;  however,  it  was  not  possible  to 
place  a  sensor  directly  on  the  cavity  wall.    Several 
surface temperature sensors were placed on the outside 
of the RF structure and water temperature sensors were 
placed  in  various  locations  throughout  the  water 
cooling  system. 
information 
available,  the  desired  process  variable  for  the  TFB 
mode was the water temperature on the transition line 
leading  from  the  four  parallel  annular  paths  on  the 
back side of the RF cavity to the output manifold.  This 
parameter  was  the  most  representative  of  cavity 
temperature,  and  had  the  smallest  time  delay  between 
it and the cavity temperature changes.

2.3  Results 

Overall, the RCCS for the Hot Model worked well.  
The  water  skid,  water  transfer  lines,  orifice  plates, 
manifolds, and the water cooling pathways distributed 
water  evenly  and  as  expected.    Both  the  TFB  and 
RFEFB  RCCS  control  modes  brought  the  process 
variable  into  an  acceptable  region  about  the  set  point 
with settling times on the order of 3 - 5  minutes.   

In  particular,  the  results  in  Figure  3,  show  the 
success of the RFEFB mode.  This plot shows the RF 
error tracking the set point of 5.9V over a series of RF 
power fluctuations, severe drops, and total losses.  The 
RF  error  tracks  inside  the  dead  band  within  3  or  4 
minutes.  A slight drift from the dead band does occur.  
On  analysis  of  the  related  data,  the  cause  of  this  drift 
was determined to be fluctuations in the facility chilled

water.    The  oscillations  of  approximately  0.3V  about 
the set point resulted from the coarseness of resolution 
in  the  3-Way  control  valve.    Both  the  facility  chilled 
water  and  valve  resolution  findings  will  be  applied  to 
the SNS CCL. 

3  MODEL VALIDATION 
As part of the RCCS design/tuning process, the data 
collected from the Hot Model experiments will be used 
in  a  model  validation  scheme  to  validate  the  RCCS 
simulation  used  during  the  design  of  the  RCCS.    The 
motivation  is  to  use  the  validated  RCCS  model  to  aid 
in  tuning  the  RCCS  PID  control  loops  for  the  SNS 
project. 

The  validation  technique  that  will  be  used  is  being 
developed  as  part  of  the  authors  dissertation  research. 
Within  a  model  reference  adaptive  control  (MRAC) 
framework, the nominal model is considered the plant 
to be controlled or adapted.  The model reference, i.e. 
the desired output of the model is for a specific mode 
of  operation  and  is  inferred  using  a  Bayesian  belief 
network (BBN) utilizing the relationships between the 
mode  or  operating  conditions  of  a  desired  run  and 
experimental  data  from  runs  with  similar  mode  or 
operating conditions.  The control logic is provided by 
a model parameter updating BBN augmented with cost 
and  decision  nodes.  The  updater  BBN  utilizes  expert 
knowledge  of  model  behavior 
statistical 
and 
knowledge  of  model 
input/output  relations.  The 
BBN/MRAC  scheme  minimizes  model  parameter 
uncertainty  by  reducing  the  difference  between  the 
simulation  model  outputs  and  the  operational  run 
specific reference model outcomes. [3]

Summary

The symmetric distribution and all other states in the

symmetry sector of the frequency trajectory increase mean

fitness during competitive replication at sublinear

propagation rates (parabolic time course). States in the

non-symmetry sector, by contrast, produce negative time

variations in mean fitness. The polymorphic steady state

attained in sublinear systems is destabilised by formation

of a variant with above threshold fitness. Evolution in

the post-steady state interval increases threshold

fitness. Contrary to the proposition that ’parabolic

growth invariably results in the survival of all competing

species,’ only species with sufficient fitness to avoid

subthreshold frequencies survive.

  1. Introduction

Pre-replication, prebiotic and biological stages of

evolution can be interpreted as a damping response to

suitably scaled thermodynamic and kinetic (selection)

forces (Davis, 1996a, 1998). In addition to including the

early stages that preceded self-propagation, the

statistical physics of evolution also provides a

theoretical basis for both gradual and episodic

transitions in the origin of species. Since pre-

replication events and non-gradual transitions are alien

to a theory of evolution based on comparative doubling

rates among competing alleles or polymers, the proposed

theory has wider scope. 

   Damping of the kinetic force during competitive

replication was initially restricted to positive time

variations in the mean formation rate constant (mean

fitness). The validity of this condition was assured at

linear rates of propagation (Fisher, 1930; Davis, 1978).

At sub-linear propagation rates, mean fitness also

increases, as required, when species frequencies are

symmetrically distributed. Since sub-linear systems

include non-symmetric states and can also decrease mean

fitness over time, this quasi-linear theory, restricted to

linear force damping relations at sub-linear kinetics,

plainly represented an incomplete model. While force

damping relations unconstrained by this requirement are

now established (Davis, 1998), the finding that

propagation at sub-linear rates resembles Darwinian 

4

evolution in certain aspects remains of interest.

   Fractional order (0 < y < 1) kinetics occur in

replicase-free, template-directed synthesis of DNA or RNA

oligomers (von Kiedrowski, 1986; Zielinski and Orgel,

1987; von Kiedrowski et al., 1991). These processes are

relevant to pre-replicase stages in the origin of life.

Synthesis follows a parabolic time course, because the

rate of second order annealing between free complementary

strands accelerates with advancement of synthesis. As

duplex molecules sre synthetically inactive, they

increasingly retard synthesis. Szathmary and Gladkih

(1989) found that competitive replication at sub-linear

propagation rates evolves toward a non-Darwinian

attractor. A polymorphic steady state was discovered to

replace ’survival of the fittest’. Their condition for

species coexistence was subsequently revised to remove an

inaccuracy (Davis, 1996b). The concept of an attractor at

non-limit frequencies (p (cid:133) 1, 0), nonetheless, remained

valid.

   In a second departure from Darwinian systems, 

sub-linear systems were demonstrated to optimize the y-

mean of fitness (excess production term), rather than

arithmetic mean (Davis, 1996a, Appendix B). An extremum

reported by Varga and Szathmary (1997) is a polymer-scale

version of this principle. Holder(cid:146)s inequality was used to

obtain this result, while the former study relied on

variational calculus.

   Despite these departures from Darwinian evolution, it

will  be shown that the symmetry-related increase in mean 

5

fitness extends to all states in the symmetry sector of

the frequency trajectory during competitive replication at

sub-linear propagation rates. In addition, it is

demonstrated that the fitness threshold for species

survival is non-decreasing in sub-linear systems. The

apparent source of a misinterpretation (Varga and

Szathmary, 1997) regarding a term in the equation for time

variations in mean fitness is identified. Broadly, the

proposition that molecular evolution at sub-linear

propagation rates (parabolic growth) ’invariably results

in the survival of all competing types’ is disproved and

this process is shown to be far more Darwinian than

previously realized.                                       

                       

2. Mean fitness increases in symmetric frequency

distributions   

The equation for rate of change in mean fitness during

competitive replication at sub-linear propagation rates

was previously demonstrated to imply that time variations

in mean fitness are positive, when species frequencies are

symmetrically distributed (Davis, 1996a, p. 88). Figures

1a,b,c illustrate the power of this symmetry principle.

Negative rates of change in mean fitness (-0.2x10 and

-5.0x10  M s ) in two frequency distributions convert to a

-4

‰ -2

positive rate of change in mean fitness (+8.7x10  M s ),

-4

‰ -2

when both distributions are combined to form a

distribution with translational symmetry. Counter-

6

Darwinian time variations in mean fitness at ‰-order

kinetics are thus suppressed by symmetry.

   Figures 1d,e show that inversion of the distributions

in Figs. 1a,b yields two non-symmetric distributions with

positive rates of change in mean fitness (+5.2x10  and

-4

+9.6x10  M s ). They also yield a positive rate of change

-4

‰ -2

in mean fitness, when combined into a symmetric

distribution. The merged distribution displays a strongly

positive rate of change in mean fitness (+18.5x10  M s ).

-4

‰ -2

Symmetry can therefore produce positive time variations in

mean fitness at fractional order kinetics, whether the

initial frequency distribution exhibits a Darwinian or

counter-Darwinian pattern of evolution.

   As might be anticipated, positive time variations in

mean fitness are exhibited by distributions with other

forms of symmetry. In Figs. 1g,h, two distributions with

mirror symmetry (concave-upright bell and convex-inverted

bell) increase mean fitness at rates of +9.1x10  and

-4

+20.8x10  M s .

3. Symmetry-sector of the frequency trajectory  

When a system evolves toward a stable polymorphic steady

state (Szathmary and Gladkih, 1989; Davis, 1996b, 1998;

Varga and Szathmary, 1997), the direction of change in

mean fitness with time  depends on the initial state. One

set of species frequencies will yield positive time

variations in the mean, as a low initial fitness is 

7

elevated to its steady state value. Another set produces

negative rates of change in mean fitness, lowering the

mean to its steady state value. The former set of

frequencies can be expected from Section 2 to include the

symmetry distribution.

   The trajectory of each frequency distribution during

pairwise competitive replication at ‰-order kinetics is

depicted in Fig. 2. These curves give the rate of change

in frequency at different species frequencies (Davis,

1998). They were obtained on comparing DNA synthesis in

two replicase-free preparations in the study of Sievers    

and von Kiedrowski (1994). Template-directed synthesis of

    FIGURE 2

dCCGCCG (dAA) and its complementary hexamer, dCGGCGG

(dBB), versus that of dCCGCGG (dAB) (Sievers and von

Kiedrowski, Figs. 3b and 3d) is shown. Synthesis in the

former was faster; m(dAA/dBB) = 9.37x10  M s  and m(dAB) =

-6

‰ -1

2.44x10  M s  (Davis, 1998). At ‰-order kinetics, there is

-6

‰ -1

a steady state when dAA/dBB has a (monomer, or polymer

scale) mole fraction (p(A)) of 0.937; p(B) is (1 - p(A))

and is then 0.063. The S-sector of the ’figure 8’ formed

by these frequency trajectories contains states with p(A)

values less than 0.937. Included in this sector is the

symmetry state; p(A) = p(B) = 0.5. 

   Species frequencies in the S-sector (Fig. 2) change in

a way that elevates dAA/dBB and reduces dAB. As dAA/dBB

has the higher formation rate constant, S-sector states

are Darwinian, in the sense that they produce positive

time variations in mean fitness. N-Sector trajectories 

8

(frequencies on right of steady state; p(A) > 0.937),

conversely, decrease dAA/dBB and increase dAB. Mean

fitness accordingly decreases with time in this sector. In

this pattern of change all frequencies on one arm (from

steady state to the limit frequency) of each trajectory

alter fitness in the same direction with time. The

frequency trajectories of a pair of competing species thus

exhibit a mirror symmetry about the abcissa, with an

intersection at steady state. 

   DNA synthesis actually departed from ‰-order kinetics

in these experiments (Davis, 1998). Steady state was

shifted to p(A) . 0.60, as a result. This decreased S-

sector states and so reduced the range of frequencies that

give rise to Darwinian evolution. It is of interest to set

limits on the range of steady state frequencies and this

issue is taken up in Section 5.

replication at sub-linear propagation rates is non-

decreasing

distribution. This inequality is extended in Section 5 to

all states in the S-sector of the frequency trajectory

(Fig. 2). The first term on the rhs of the rate equation 

(Davis, 1996a, eqns. 3, A4; Davis, 1996b, eqn. 9) is

apart from inclusion in eqn. (2) of a scale factor, < /<G;

i

<  being the number of ’monomers’ in sequence-i and <G is

i

the mean number of ’monomers’ per strand. m  is a formation

rate constant; at linear propagation rates it represents a

Malthusian fitness parameter. V  is the polymer-scale mole

i

fraction of i-sequence, S /S. p(i) is their monomer-scale

i

frequency; p(i) = < S /<GS (Davis, 1996a, p. 71), where S

is the concentration of single strands (replicative form)

This yields the y-mean square rate constant at monomer

scale (eqn. 2) as the first rhs term for time variations

in mean formation rate constant (eqn. 1). 

   The second rhs term in eqn. (1) is a product of the y-

10

mean and arithmetic mean for rate constants; m(cid:152) =

Ei(< /<G)m V  and m = E m p(i). At first order (y = 1), the

i

i i

i i

y

rhs of eqn.(1) equals the statistical variance in

formation rate constants, consistent with Fisher’s

theorem. 

   Varga and Szathmary (1997, eqn. 8; the rate equation

given lacks a time derivative) misinterpret the first rhs

term of the rate equation (eqn. 1). Rather than the term

defined (Davis, 1996a, p.88; eqn. 2), they state it as

(Varga and Szathmary, eqn. 10)  

E (< /<G)m V

i

i

i

2y

allowing for changes in notation and scale. Thus, they

give it as the square of the y-mean rate constant

(exponent above tilde),rather than the required y-mean of

square rate constants (exponent below tilde). Their error

could arise from incorrectly composing the probability

product,  V p(i). Instead of V , as they state, the

y-1

2y

product gives V  , omitting the scale factor (Davis,

y

i

1996a, p.88; eqn. 4).

5. Generalized symmetry principle

The rate equation specifying changes in mean fitness under

fractional order kinetics (eqn. 1) indicates that time

variations in the mean comply with the following

inequalities (Davis, 1996a,b),

m  > m(cid:152)mG  |   mG’ > 0                             (5a)  

m  < m(cid:152)mG  |   mG’ < 0                             (5b)  

11

m , m(cid:152) and mG are the y-mean of squared fitness, y-mean and

arithmetic mean of fitness (Section 4). Time variations in

frequency of species-i are then (Davis, 1996a, eqn. A3)

An equifrequent species distribution is the lower

frequency limit for steady state. It indicates all species

have equal fitness. Any system with an equifrequent

distribution of species, which differ in fitness will

consequently produce positive time variations in mean

fitness;

   Pairwise competition between species i and j at non-

stationary frequencies gives rise to positive time

0) mark the lower limit of the steady state range; m  = m  

i

(eqn. 11b). Apart from this state, p(i)’ will be positive

(eqn. 14). Given that m  > m , eqn.(11a) requires that V(cid:136)

exceed V(cid:136) . This implies that V(cid:136)  also exceeds V  in any pre-

j

i

i

steady state, when i and j are a pair of initially

equifrequent, non-neutral species. Time variations in p(i)

will be positive, therefore, as the system evolves toward

steady state. The two-fold symmetry of frequency

trajectories (Fig. 2) requires that species-i frequency,

at any point on the arm  containing the equifrequent

state, will increase with time; p

(i-arm)’ > 0. Every

S-sector

p(j) on the j-arm of the S-sector trajectory will

conversely decrease with time; p

(j-arm)(cid:146) < 0. As m  >

for all states in the S-sector. The generalized symmetry

principle may be stated as: All states in the frequency

trajectory sector encompassing the equifrequent

distribution display positive time variations in mean

fitness during competitive replication between a pair of

species with unequal fitness at sub-linear propagation

rates.  

   All sub-steady state i-frequencies (p(i) < p(cid:136)(i)) occur

on the upper trajectory arm in the S-sector (Fig. 2) and

they have positive time variations; p(i)’ > 0. Conversely,

only above steady state i-frequencies occur on the lower

trajectory arm in the N-sector; p(i) > p(cid:136)(i). Time

variations in p(i) are then negative; p(i)’ < 0. With m

exceeds its steady state value;

In a system with symmetrically distributed species, all

p(i)’ are positive. More generally, p(i)’ are positive for

every i, when all species frequencies are in the S-sector.

Conversely, p(i)’ is negative for all N-sector states. The

sign of the first rhs term is, therefore, indicative of

the direction of evolution in a heterogeneous system. 

   The second term (eqn. 18) contains a factor, (p(i)(m  -

6. Fitness threshold and survival of the fittest set of

species 

The steady state frequency of a species is fitness

dependent. This dependence is specified by eqn. (10) for a

system with s coexisting species. Consonant with this

relation, steady state is displaced far to the right in

Fig. 2. dAA/dBB fitness exceeded dAB fitness by almost

four-fold, during replicase-free synthesis of these DNA

hexamers (Sievers and von Kiedrowski, 1994); m(dAA/dBB)

and m(dAB) were, respectively, 9.37x10  and 2.44x10  M s

‰ -1

(Davis, 1998). Their steady state frequencies were 

17

estimated as 0.937 and 0.063, assuming ‰-order kinetics.

With this disparity in steady state frequencies, a small

system is likely to exclude, dAB. The Poisson

probability,(1 -e

), of sampling at least 1 dAB

-p(dAB)

molecule indicates the minimum sample size is nearly 16

DNA molecules. Sub-threshold systems should be homogeneous

for dAA/dBB, rather than polymorphic. 

   From eqn. (10), the frequency threshold imposes the

following constraint on frequency,

        

n(cid:142)  = U n m

  [  (cid:219) 1 , 0 < y < 1 (frequency limit)(20)

n refers to the total number of replicating molecules. For

any molecular system there is a cut-off frequency; (cid:142)* =

1/n. Species having a sub-threshold frequency should be

excluded from the system. Accordingly, only species with

fitness exceeding the lower limit,

can coexist. This inequality indicates that an increase in

fitness or a decrease in the number of DNA molecules, n,

within a system elevates the lower limit for species

fitness at steady state. Species with sub-threshold

fitness experience negative selection and are likely to be

excluded from steady state. Survival of the fittest thus 

18

applies at sub-linear propagation rates. Only the set of

species with above threshold fitness will survive.

Survivor fitness determines its abundance at steady state

(eqn. 10).  

   Figure 3 depicts the effect of a variant with high      

                           FIGURE 3

fitness on the steady state frequency distribution

attained in a model system that is limited to a constant

number (100) of replicator molecules at ‰-order kinetics.

Initially, species S1, S2, S3 and S4 coexist. Their steady

state frequencies being 1, 3, 43 and 53, reflecting

fitness (formation rate constants) of 0.06, 0.1, 0.36 and

0.4 M s , respectively. Formation of variant, V1, with

‰ -1

fitness 0.41 M s  destabilizes the initial steady state.

‰ -1

This forces the frequency of S1 to sub-threshold levels;

p(S1) < 0.01. Above average fitness of V1 and elimination

of S1, with below average fitness, increases mean fitness

from 0.37 to 0.39 M s . A new steady state forms with 2 S2,

‰ -1

28 S3, 34 S4 and 36 V1 molecules. The frequency of S2, S3

and S4 has decreased. In particular, S2 now approaches

elimination. 

   According to eqn (20), addition of any species with

above threshold fitness will lower the frequency of all

species in a pre-existing steady state. This moves species

with low fitness closer to the frequency threshold,

elevating their risk of exclusion from the system. As

species with sub-threshold fitness are excluded from

steady state, while any species with above threshold

fitness is accepted, it is apparent that threshold fitness 

19

represents a non-decreasing quantity in competitive

replication at sub-linear propagation rates. 

   This conclusion may be formalized by noting that the

sum of species fitness term in eqn. (21) is initially 

        s

   Increases in the fitness threshold accompany addition

of even a low fitness variant. Addition of a variant with

fitness of 0.11 M s  to the steady state between S1, S2, S3

‰ -1

and S4 is depicted in Fig. 3. It reduced mean fitness 

20

from 0.37 to 0.36 M s . In contrast, the variant raises the

‰ -1

fitness threshold from 0.055 to 0.056 M s . Fig. 3

demonstrates that addition of a variant with above average

fitness will raise both mean and threshold fitness; the

mean increased from 0.37 to 0.39 M s  and the fitness

threshold simultaneously increased from 0.055 to 0.068 

‰ -1

M s .

   Equations (20, 22) also imply that the interval until

elimination of a species during competitive replication at

sub-linear propagation rates is fitness dependent. Since

the fitness threshold increases during evolution, species

possessing progressively higher fitness will be excluded

from the system,

    This principle is illustrated in Fig. 4. A steady

with higher fitness over an interval of 11 min. S1, S2 and

S3 were pushed to sub-threshold frequencies and excluded

after evolution for intervals of 703, 715 and 729 s. The

length of each exclusion interval corresponds to the

fitness ranking of a species, as required for propagation

at sub-linear rates (eqn. 22). To obtain an explicit 

21

relation between exclusion interval and replicative

fitness, error rates and topography of fitness space would

need to be considered.

7. Discussion

A distinction has been made in this investigation between

the attractor of an evolving system and the nearest

accessible stationary state. In competitive replication at

sub-linear propagation rates, a system evolves toward a

polymorphic steady state - the revised Szathmary-Gladkih

attractor (Davis, 1996b; eqn. 7b). A distribution of

species frequencies consistent with the attractor-

specified profile was seen to be subject to modification

by the system. Those frequencies that correspond to less

than one replicator molecule should be omitted. Model

prebiotic systems were found to display a steady state

distribution truncated at the frequency threshold (Section

6).

   Since the steady state frequency attained by a species

is fitness dependent, only species with above threshold

fitness can be expected to survive competitive replication

at sublinear propagation rates. It is evident, moreover,

that exclusion of species with subthreshold fitness

combined with admission of all species above the threshold

will cause the fitness threshold to increase over time

(Section 6). Consequently, propagation any operative error

rate will result in selection against species with sub-

threshold fitness and an increase in the sum of species 

22

fitness. 

   In replicase-free synthesis of complementary (dAA/dBB)

and self-complementary (dAB) DNA hexamers (Sievers and

Kiedrowski, 1994) virtually all variants would exceed the

fitness threshold. Synthesis was initiated in these

experiments in a 1 (cid:181)l capillary containing around 9.64x10

13

DNA molecules (about 0.16 mM). As dAA/dBB and dAB had

formation rate constants of 9.37x10  and 2.44x10  M s ,

-6

-6

‰ -1

respectively, threshold fitness (eqn. 21) for their steady

state was only 9.86x10

M s ; about seven orders of

-13  ‰ -1

magnitude less than the fitness of dAA/dBB. In view of

this extremely low fitness threshold, essentially all

variants would be retained by the system, increasing

heterogeneity over time. Calculation reveals that a steady

state with almost 7x10  species, with fitness comparable

12

to dAA/dBB, would elevate the fitness threshold to 2.5x10

-6

‰ -1 

M s . This threshold is sufficient to exclude dAB.

Heterogeneity of this level clearly exceeds the capacity

of any hexameric quaternary sequence (4 = 4096). All

6 

possible sequences up to 21 to 22 nucleotides (Davis,

1996a, p. 74) yield heterogeneity of this amount, after

discounting one-fourth (m(dAB)/m(dAA/dBB) . …) of

sequences that have sub-threshold fitness. On reducing a

model prebiotic system to around 100 molecules, however,

only 7 or 8 species, with fitness equal to dAA/dBB, are

sufficient to raise the fitness threshold sufficiently to

exclude dAB.

   By establishing that the fitness threshold is a non-

decreasing parameter in sub-linear molecular evolution a 

23

link is made between this process and Darwinian evolution.

The stationary state fitness threshold in a Darwinian

system can be deduced from the expression for frequency

invariance in a Darwinian system,

p(i)(cid:146) = p(i)(mi - mG )= 0 | m  = mG  (cid:156)  

ss

i

ss

i

where it is seen to equal the stationary state mean

fitness. Increases in the fitness threshold within this

system shift it toward a homogeneous state of maximum

fitness. In this event, threshold fitness equals both the

stationary state mean and maximum fitness: m* = mG  = m .

ss

max

Even with a Darwinian attractor a polymorphic stationary

state is accessible, when there exist neutral variants.

Since Fisher (1930), positive time variations in the mean

of fitness among competing alleles and molecular

replicators (Davis, 1978) have had a place at the center

of evolution theory. 

   Positive time variations in mean fitness are a less

general feature of sub-linear molecular evolution than

increases in the fitness threshold. An increasing mean

fitness is limited to the symmetry distribution (Davis,

1996a) and other states in the S-sector of the frequency

trajectory (Section 3). Frequency changes in N-sector

states produce negative rates of change in the mean (Fig.

2). Whereas, the fitness threshold is non-decreasing in

both linear and sub-linear (S- + N-sector) systems. Hence,

this principle is a more general than Fisher’s fundamental

theorem of natural selection, although it is not as 

24

general as the force damping principle (Davis, 1996a,

1998). 

   A stable steady state can form among a set of

competitively replicating species that propagate at a

fixed fractional order with respect to template

concetration (Varga and Szathmary, 1997; Davis, 1998).

Addition of a variant with above threshold fitness

destabilises the steady state. Elimination of low fitness

species was demonstrated to occur in the post-steady state

transition (Section 5). A continuous stream of variants,

formed by errors during propagation, would prevent

evolution from being trapped at the first accessible

steady state in a sublinear system. Selection against

species with sub-threshold fitness, moreover, would

elevate the fitness threshold with time. Its non-Darwinian

attractor notwithstanding. molecular evolution at

sublinear propagation rates therefore parallels Darwinian

evolution in this respect.

   Since Fisher (1930), positive time variations in the

mean of fitness among competing alleles or self-

replicating polynucleotide molecules (Davis, 1978) have

been known to characterize Darwinian evolution.

Displacement of the system to a more probable kinetic

state results (Davis, 1996a) and this is a feature of all

states in the S-sector of the frequency trajectory

(Sections 3, 5). N-sector states produce negative changes

in mean fitness, because the kinetic force is coupled to a

second force. Replicase-free synthesis of DNA or RNA

oligomers (von Kiedrowski, 1986; Zielinski and Orgel, 

25

1987) at fractional order kinetics couples synthesis and

duplex formation. The latter is accelerated by advancement

of synthesis and duplex formation then retards synthesis.

These inter-relationships account for a parabolic time

course during synthesis (von Kiedrowski et al., 1991). The

decrease in mean fitness resulting from a high-fitness

replicator at above steady state frequency can be

attributed to the action of the thermodynamic force

driving duplex formation. By preferentially retarding

synthesis of sequences with high propagation rates, this

force drives the system to a non-optimal kinetic state

(high effective activation free energy) for replication. A

displacement in this direction is consistent with the

action of a negative kinetic force. Stability arises at

steady state, when an equilibrium exists between the

kinetic force, driving a system to its most probable

kinetic state, and the thermodynamic force responsible for

strand annealing. As displacement of the frequency

distribution ceases at steady state, no net force then

acts on the distribution. The transition to steady state

can consequently be depicted (Davis, 1998) as damping a

scalar force based on generalized rate coefficients for

synthesis.

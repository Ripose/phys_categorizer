1. Abstract 
 
In this paper we show how a two dimensional fluid model can be used to interpret data obtained 
from an inclined Mach-probe or a Gundestrup probe. We use an analytical approximation of the 
solution  of  the  differential  equations  describing  the  relation  between  the  plasma  flow  and  the 
measured  ion  saturation  currents  at  the  probe’s  surface.  The  parameters  of  this  analytical 
solution  are  determined  by  comparison  with  the  exact  numerical  solution  of  the  equations.  In 
this way we are able to measure the parallel as well as the perpendicular Mach numbers over the 
whole parameter range with a minimum accuracy of 90%. 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Mach  probes  are  a  common  diagnostic  to  measure  the  flows  and  electric  field  profiles  in  the 
//,M ^ )  of  the  parallel  and  perpendicular  (in  the 
edge  of  fusion  machines.  The  Mach  numbers  (
magnetic  surface,  but  perpendicular  to  the  magnetic  field)  flow  of  the  unperturbed  plasma  are 
derived  from  the  ratio  R  of  the  up-  and  downstream  ion  saturation  currents.  To  derive 
//M , 
Hutchinson  [1]  has  developed  a  1-D  fluid  probe  model,  which  has  been  extended  by  Van 
Goubergen [2] to study the influence of  M ^ on the ratio R of the up- and downstream current, 
when the inclination angle q  of the probe surface with respect to the magnetic field is changed. 
These models essentially relate the ion saturation currents measured at the probes surfaces to the 
Mach  numbers  of  the  flow  of  the  plasma  not  perturbed  by  the  probe  via  a  set  of  coupled 
differential  equations.  The  numerical  solutions  of  these  equations  can  be  approximated  by  an 
analytical  function 
,  were  c  is  a  constant  equal  to  2.3 [3]. However, a 
comparison  with  the  numerical  solution  of  the  differential  equation  shows  that  c  depends  on 
, resulting in an underestimation of the Mach numbers when the analytical model 
M M
// ,
with constant  c  is used. For values up to

to  25%  for  larger  values  as  for  example  encountered  in  biasing  experiments  [4,5,6].  Based on 
the numerical (exact) solution of the differential equations we developed an expression for  c  in 
which the dependency on 
 has been taken into account. This technique allows us 
to  drastically  reduce  the  errors.  In  the  following  section  we  describe  the  fluid  model  and  we 
show the consequences of the use of a constant  c . We then introduce the proposed function for 
c  and quantify the improvement.

2. Description of a Mach probe by a 1-D fluid model 
 
Hutchinson’s model starts from the continuity equation and the parallel ion momentum equation 
[1].  Combination  of  these  equations  results  in  a  1-D  model  that  relates  the  density  and  the 
,n M ¥ ) to the density at the probe surface ( sn ) which can be 
parallel Mach number at infinity (
,  where  A  is  the  surface  of  the 
measured  via  the  ion  saturation  current  given  by 
collector  and 
sc the  sound  speed  of  the  ions.  To  measure  the  perpendicular  flow  one  has  to 
incline the surface of the collectors with respect to the flow and extend the model as has been 
done by Van Goubergen [2]. The resulting equations are:

The angle q  is the angle between the magnetic field and the collectors as shown in figure 1. All 
the other symbols indicate dimensionless quantities and are defined in [2].

The unperturbed plasma is thus described by the parallel Mach number

perpendicular flow and the ions reach the sound speed at the MPSE. When the probe is inclined, 
perpendicular flow is measured, and the parallel Mach number at the MPSE has to adapt itself to 
a value imposed by equation (3). Figure 3 shows that, due to the conservation of particles, the 
ion density in the pre-sheath must decrease when the ions accelerate towards the MPSE.

Therefore,  in  the  following  we  present  a  better  definition  for  c,  which  minimizes  the  error

and the inclination angle of the collectors with respect to the magnetic field. This expression has 
been  derived  over  the  full  parameter  range  (

.  We  showed  that 
when  a  constant  value  for  c   is  chosen  an  error  builds  up  when  the  flows  grow  and  when  the 
inclination  angle  deviates  from  90°.  During  biasing  experiments  [4,5,6]  higher  flows  are 
induced in the edge plasma and the use of the improved analytical approach is recommended.

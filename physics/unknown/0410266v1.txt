A  recently  proposed  technique  is  described  that  provides  improved  nearsie-farside  (NF)  decompositions  of
elastic scattering amplitudes. The technique, involving a new resummation formula for Legendre partial wave
series, reduces the importance of unphysical contributions to NF subamplitudes, which can appear in more con-
ventional NF decompositions. Applications are made to a strong absorption model that arises in chemical and
nuclear physics, as well as to a 16O + 12C optical potential at Elab = 132 MeV.

Semiclassical methods are not always simple to ap-
ply and sometimes they have a limited range of appli-
cability.  In  order  to  overcome  these  difficulties  it  is
possible  to  apply  a  simple  NF  decomposition  to  the
elastic scattering amplitude f(θ), that was proposed by
Fuller [3] more than 25 years ago. Fuller’s NF method
uses only the quantum mechanical scattering matrix el-
ements Sl, therefore bypassing the difficulties in using
semiclassical methods. The aim of a NF method is to
split the full scattering amplitude f(θ) into the sum of
two  subamplitudes,  f (–)(θ)  and  f (+)(θ),  describing  the
contributions from the N and F scattered particles, re-
spectively.

The Fuller NF method was introduced to treat nucle-
us-nucleus  scattering,  where  a  long  range  Coulombic

We recall, in fact, that the PWS in (1), considered as a
distribution,  is  convergent  also  if  Sl  is  asymptotically
Coulombic [4].

In Section 2, we outline the Fuller NF method and
discuss some of its limitations. Section 3 describes an
improved NF method using resummation techniques that
reduces the importance of unphysical contributions to
the NF subamplitudes. Results from our improved NF
method for the elastic scattering of two collision sys-
tems are presented in Section 4. Our conclusions are in
Section 5.

2.  FULLER  NF  METHOD
AND  ITS  LIMITATIONS

The Fuller NF decomposition is realized by splitting
Pl(cosθ), considered as a standing angular wave, into
traveling angular wave components

(θ)  should  correspond  to  NF  trajectories  re-
the 
spectively appearing in the complete semiclassical de-
composition of f(θ) (Ref. [1], p. 121).

The NF decomposition is in general less satisfactory
than the full semiclassical one. For example, if two or
more N or F semiclassical trajectories contribute to the
same θ, interference effects may appear in the N or F
cross sections. The Fuller NF decomposition has, how-
ever, the merit of being simple and, although inspired
by the semiclassical theories, it uses only quantities cal-
culated  within  the  exact  quantum  mechanical  treat-
ment. The NF method therefore bypasses problems as-
sociated with the applicability and validity of semiclas-
sical theories.

The  physical  meaning  attributed  to  the 

(θ)  is
implicitly based on the (unproven) hypothesis that it is
possible to perform on the PWS, written in terms of the
+−(
(cosθ), the same manipulations that are used in de-
Ql
riving  the  complete  semiclassical  decomposition  of
f(θ). These manipulations are path deformations in λ of
the integrals into which (1) can be transformed, using
either  the  Poisson  summation  formula  or  the  Watson
transformation. The consequences of these path defor-
mations  depend  on  the  properties  of  the  terms  in  the
PWS when they are continued to real or complex val-
ues of λ from the initial half integer λ values. The split-
(cosθ) modifies these proper-
ting of Pl(cosθ) into 
ties and can cause the appearance of unphysical contri-
butions in the 

(θ) which cancel out in f(θ).

In spite of these possible limitations, the Fuller NF
decomposition is widely used, as demonstrated by the
fact that the ISI Web of Science reports about 140 cita-
tions since 1981 to the original Fuller work. In many
nucleus-nucleus scattering cases [5, 6], the Fuller meth-
od effectively decomposes f(θ) into simpler subampli-
tudes, which are free from the unphysical contributions
that can arise from the above mathematical difficulties.
However for a few examples, the NF subamplitudes can
be directly compared with the corresponding semiclassi-
cal results and it is found that the Fuller and semiclassical
decompositions predict different results. One classic ex-
ample  is  pure  Coulomb  scattering.  For  repulsive  Cou-
lomb potentials only a N contribution is expected semi-
classically ([1], p. 56), whereas the Fuller NF decomposi-
tion yields also a F contribution [3]. Another important

ïàåàóÖëäÄü  îàáàäÄ      ÚÓÏ  23      ‹  2      2004

example is the angular distribution for a strong absorp-
tion model (SAM) with a two parameter (Λ and ∆) sym-
metric S-matrix element and Fermi-like form factors [7]

with λ = l + 1/2. For a fixed value of the cut-off param-
eter Λ and for a sufficiently large value of the diffuse-
ness  parameter  ∆,  the  Fuller  NF  cross  sections  agree
with the semiclassical results only up to a certain value
of θ, which decreases with increasing ∆.

Fortunately,  the  Fuller  NF  subamplitudes  contain
information that allows one to recognize the unphysical
nature of the undesired contributions. Suppose f (+)(θ),
or f (–)(θ), contains a single contribution from a station-
ary phase point at λ(θ). Then the derivative with respect
to θ of the phase of f (+)(θ), or f (–)(θ), is equal to λ(θ), or
–λ(θ)  respectively.  Following  Fuller  we  will  call  this
derivative the Local Angular Momentum (LAM) for the
N  (or  F)  subamplitude;  it  depends  on  θ  ([1],  p.  57).
Only  for  certain  generalized  diffracted  trajectories  is
the LAM expected to be constant, equal to the angular
momentum of the incoming particle responsible for the
diffraction.  In  the  semiclassical  regime,  this  constant
value is expected to be large. Because of this, if we ob-
serve that in a certain θ range LAM ≈ 0, this can be con-
sidered the signature of the unphysical nature of the N
or F subamplitudes in that range of θ. This occurs for
the LAM of the Fuller Coulomb F subamplitude, and
for the NF subamplitudes of the SAM in the angular re-
gion where the Fuller NF cross sections differ from the
semiclassical results. In both cases this decoupling of θ
from LAM suggests the unphysical nature of the sub-
amplitudes.  Thus  an  analysis  of  the  LAM  can  avoid
misleading  interpretations  of  cross  sections  obtained
from the Fuller NF decomposition. However the prob-
lem of obtaining more satisfactory NF decompositions
remains open.

3.  IMPROVED  NF  METHOD  USING 
RESUMMATION  THEORY

A possible solution to the problem was proposed by
Hatchell [7], who used a modified NF decomposition.
The modifications consisted of, first, writing f(θ) in the
resumed form (θ ≠ 0)

the Legendre polynomials into travelling waves.

The use of the resummed form (7) for f(θ) was orig-
inally proposed [8] by Yennie, Ravenhall, and Wilson
(YRW)  to  speed  up  the  convergence  of  the  PWS  for
high-energy  electron-nucleus  scattering.  Equation  (7)

is an exact resummation formula, of order r, which is
derived from the recurrence relation for Legendre poly-
nomials.  The  YRW  resummation  formula  can  be  de-

rived by iterating r times, starting from

Note that f(θ) is independent of r, unlike the Fuller NF
subamplitudes which do depend on the value of r used.
This is a consequence of the property lQl – 1(cosθ)

as l 
 0 [9]. In the Hatchell approach, the dependence
on r arises because the functions used in place of the
Ql(cosθ) obey a (inhomogeneous) recurrence relation
different from that for Ql(cosθ). It is worthwhile to note
that (7), for r ≥ 1, makes irrelevant the 1 appearing in
the term (Sl – 1) in (2) for θ > 0. The linear transforma-

Using his method, Hatchell has shown [7] that the
unphysical contributions to the SAM NF cross sections
systematically decrease on increasing r. More recently
(cosθ)
[11],  it  was  shown  that,  using  the  Fuller 
functions in (7), gives even better results. The superior-
(cosθ) functions seems to be connected

The  success  of  using  (7)  before  applying  the  NF
splitting (3), (4) of Pl(cosθ) depends on the properties
of the 
. For the SAM, the contributions form low l
values rapidly decrease [11] with increasing r. As a re-
sult, the most important contributions move to higher
values of l, where a semiclassical description is physi-
cally more reasonable.

However, in some cases, (7) acts in the opposite direc-
tion, by enhancing the undesired unphysical contributions
to  the  NF subamplitudes.  We  have  found  that this  hap-
pens, for example, for pure Coulomb scattering, for scat-
tering by an impenetrable sphere, and for the SAM [14]
when the cross section is calculated at an angle π – θ, using
the property Pl[cos(π – θ)] = (–1)lPl(cosθ).

One  possible  solution  to  this  puzzle  was  recently
found by introducing an improved NF method [15, 16],
based, first, in dropping the 1 from the term (Sl – 1) in the
PWS for f(θ), and, second, in considering (8) only as a
particular case of a modified resummation identity [17]

The utility of using the resummation identity (10),
rather than the YRW (8) used by Hatchell, is suggested
by the fact that this resummation identity with β ≡ β
1 =
= … = β
r is a particular case of a more general one [17],
which uses a basis set of reduced rotation matrix ele-
ments; this gives the amplitude for more general scat-
tering processes than those described by (1). For these
general  PWS,  a  Fuller-like  NF  decomposition  can  be
introduced [19–21] which allows the scattering ampli-
tude to be split into NF subamplitudes. In some cases,
the NF cross sections contain unexpected (unphysical)

oscillations [17], which are enhanced if the generaliza-
tion of (7) is used, but which disappear for an appropriate
choice of the β-parameter in the generalization of (12).
Similarly,  the  unphysical  contribution  to  the  NF
subamplitudes  of  the  SAM  [14]  when  the  scattering
amplitude is calculated at π – θ decrease by increasing
the order of the resummation with the choice β ≡ β
1 =
= … = β
r = 1. On the contrary, using the Fuller NF de-
composition in the YRW (7), for which β ≡ β
1 = … =
= β
r = –1, the unphysical contributions become larger
on increasing the resummation order.

1 = … = β

These  results  suggest  that  the  modified  resummed
form (12) be used to diminish unphysical contamina-
tions to the NF subamplitudes. To do this, we must give
a practical rule to fix the values of the β
i parameters.
In Refs. [14, 17], it was proposed to select the value of
β ≡ β
r so that (1 + βcosθ)–r approximately
mimics the shape of the angular distribution. The shape
of the cross section can however be very different from
that given by (1 + βcosθ)–r. It is therefore desirable to
use a different recipe, based possibly on a simple rule.
The quantitative recipe proposed in [15, 16] is inspired
by the observation that the modified resummation for-
mulas produce a more physical NF decomposition by
reducing the contribution from the low l values in the
resummed PWS. This suggests we select the β
2, …,
β
r in r repeated applications of (10), so as to eliminate
as many low l contributions as possible from the final
}  to
PWS  in  (12).  The  transformation  from  {

)

i 1–(

} is linear tridiagonal, with coefficients linear in
{
al
β
i,  which  means  application  of  r  successive  resumma-
tions allows one to equate to zero the leading r coeffi-
, with l = 0, 1, …, r – 1, by solving a system of
cients 
r equations of degree r in the parameters β
2, …, β
r.
The resummation defined in this way was named [15, 16]
an improved resummation of order r.

Higher order improved resummations require the solu-

In all cases analyzed using r ≤ 2 [15, 16, 18, 22], the
improved NF method considerably reduced the width
of the angular regions in which the Fuller NF cross sec-
tions exhibit unphysical behavior. These analyses used
Sl from simple parameterizations as well as from some
optical potentials currently employed to describe light
heavy-ion scattering.

4.  RESULTS  FOR  ELASTIC  SCATTERING
We show below our results [15] for two of these ex-
amples. The first example is a SAM (Fig. 1). The SAM
is a standard test case for NF methods [7, 11, 13], which
can be applied to atomic, molecular and nuclear collisions
in the energy range meV to GeV, since it does not depend
on the energy. The second example is the 16O + 12C colli-
sion, at Elab = 132 MeV, using the WS1 optical potential
of Ref. [23] (Fig. 2). The cross section for this potential
exhibits  many  intriguing  properties  of  light  heavy-ion
cross  sections  in  the  energy  range  around  10  MeV/A,
where A is the mass number of the projectile.

The improved NF method drops the 1 that ensures
the  convergence  of  the  original  PWS  for  the  SAM.
For the optical potential case, the Coulombic behavior
of Sl for large values of l, makes (2) not convergent in
the usual sense, with or without the 1. In both the cases

Fig. 2. Optical potential model N (continuous lines) and F
(dashed lines) cross sections (lower panels) and LIP (upper
panels) calculated using the R = 0Y and R = 1Y NF decom-
positions. The thin curves show the cross section and LIP
obtained using the full quantum amplitude in the left panels,
and the N (continuous) and F (dashed) cross sections and
LIP using classical mechanics in the right panels. The indi-
ces in the right panels identify the curves corresponding to
different branches of the classical deflection function.

presented  here,  the  PWS  defining  the  NF  subampli-
tudes  are  only  defined  in  a  distributional  sense,  and
some technique must be used to make these series con-
vergent in the usual sense. As shown in Ref. [15, 18],
an  additional  extended  YRW  resummation,  of  appro-
priate order, can be used to ensure (and also speed up)
the convergence of these series.

The  calculations  were  therefore  performed  apply-
ing: first, an improved resummation of order r = 0, 1, 2,
with r = 0 meaning no resummation, second, the Fuller
NF splitting (3), (4), and third a YRW resummation of
the NF subamplitudes using the extension of (7) to the
linear  combination  (4)  of  integer  degree  Legendre
functions of the first and second kinds [9]. This latter
resummation ensures the convergence of the final NF
PWS. The results obtained from these three steps will
be indicated by the notation R = 0Y, 1Y, 2Y.

A. Strong absorption model

For the SAM we show the results obtained using the
parameters Λ = 10 and ∆ = 2. In Fig. 1 we have plotted
the dimensionless quantity 4k2σ(θ)sinθ since the corre-
sponding  NF  semiclassical  quantities  are  expected  to
have  a  pure  exponential  slope  [7].  Furthermore,  be-
cause the Sl are real, f(θ) has a constant phase (and its
(θ) have
phase derivative is of no interest), and the 

f +−(

)

the  same  moduli  but  opposite  phases.  Thus  we  need
only show the N, or F, LAM and similarly for the cross
sections.

Figure  1  also  shows  the  results  obtained  on  intro-
ducing  the  NF  decomposition  directly  into  (1)  and
without dropping the 1 in (2). The NF subamplitudes
obtained in this way are rapidly convergent and no final
extended YRW resummation is needed. These results
are indicated by the notation R = 0.

For the original Fuller NF method, R = 0, and for the
case R = 1Y, we have plotted the F cross sections and
LAMs (dashed curves); for the cases R = 0Y and R = 2Y
the N quantities (continuous curves) are displayed.

Figure 1 shows that for R = 0 the unphysical contri-
butions dominate the F (=N) cross section over most of
the angular range. The expected exponential behavior is
not present in the F cross section curve and the F (=–N)
LAM ≈ 0 for θ (cid:2) 60°. However, at smaller angles, os-
cillations in the F LAM curve indicate that another con-
tribution is present which interferes with the unphysical
one. This behavior does not support the conjecture that
the F LAM of this other contribution has the semiclas-
sical value Λ. The major part of the unphysical contri-
bution, which dominates the F subamplitude, is the F
(θ) (14) of the δ-function contribu-
subamplitude 
tion (13) to the amplitude obtained by dropping Sl in the
(θ)  is
term  (Sl  –  1)  in  (2).  The  cross  section  for

The R = 0Y method provides more satisfactory re-
sults, which are rather good at forward angles. With the
exclusion of a small region around θ = 0°, where (5)
does not hold, the N (=–F) LAM agrees closely with the
expected semiclassical value of –Λ up to θ ≈ 50°, and
the N (=F) cross section curve follows the expected ex-
ponential behavior. For θ (cid:2) 120°, the N cross section is
still dominated by an unphysical contribution. At inter-
mediate angles, 50°  (cid:3) θ  (cid:3) 120°, interference oscilla-
tions appear both in the N cross section and in the N
LAM  curve.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  LAM  is
more sensitive to interference effects than is the cross
section. Also, in the interference region, one cannot at-
tach the meaning of a local angular momentum to the
subamplitude phase derivative. In our case, in this in-
terference region, the N LAM curve oscillates around
the  expected  semiclassical  value  of  –Λ  in  the  region,
50° (cid:3) θ (cid:3) 80°, where the true semicalssical component
dominates the N subamplitude, and around the unphys-
ical value of 0 at larger angles.

The  effectiveness  of  the  improved  resummation
procedure is evident in the right panels of Fig. 1. Using
the R = 1Y method (for which β
1 = –0.800) the F (=–N)
LAM  and  the  F  (=N)  cross  section  are  in  agreement
with the semiclassical results up to θ ≈ 120°. For R = 2Y
1, 2 = –0.879 ± 0.076i), the agreement cov-
(which has β

ers almost the whole angular range. The small irregular
oscillations appearing at large θ for the N LAM curve,
with R = 2Y, probably arise from the precision limita-
tions (64 bit floating point representation) of the calcu-
lations.

B.  Optical  potential

Figure 2 shows our results for the optical potential.
In the upper panels we display LAM/k, which we call the
Local Impact Parameter (LIP), and in the lower panels a
plot of log10[σ(θ)sinθ]. The left panels show the results
for the usual Fuller NF decomposition, R = 0Y. The thin
continuous lines, in the left panels, show the cross sec-
tion and LIP for the full amplitude. 

The behavior of the NF LIP curves is mostly simpler
than that of the full amplitude LIP. At θ ≈ 90°, the R = 0Y
N LIP curve oscillates around 0, indicating the possible
dominance of an unphysical contribution. This contri-
bution also appears to be responsible for oscillations in
the N LIP curve around other values (different from 0),
and for oscillations in the N cross section for θ (cid:2) 30°.
These  oscillations  are  absent  in  the  N  curves  in  the
right  panels,  where  the  results  for  R  =  1Y  are  shown
(β
1 = –0.999 – 0.099i). Both the N cross section and N
LIP curves for R = 1Y are considerably simpler than those
obtained using R = 0Y, while the F curves are essentially
the same; an exception is the less oscillatory F LIP for
θ (cid:2) 120°. This indicates that, apart from θ  (cid:2) 120°,  the
unphysical contribution for R = 0Y has a modulus which
is much smaller than that of the F semiclassical subam-
plitude. We have also applied the improved resumma-
tion R = 2Y. The results are practically the same as those
obtained using R = 1Y and are not shown.

The cleaning by the R = 1Y procedure of the original
R  =  0Y  NF  subamplitudes  is  impressive  and  allows  a
clear identification, in the NF cross sections at θ (cid:2) 120°,
of the dominance of semiclassical trajectories refracted
from the internal part of the nuclear interaction. In the
right panels of Fig. 2, this interpretation is confirmed by
the  agreement,  for  θ  (cid:2)  120°,  between  the  NF  curves
and the classical mechanical results (thin lines 1 and 2)
corresponding  to  impact  parameters  smaller  than  the
nuclear rainbow one. The thin lines show, in the upper
panel, different NF branches of the impact parameter and
their  dependence  on  θ  (with  appropriate  signs)  using
only the real part of the complete interaction (Ref. [22],
Fig. 1). In the lower panel we show the classical contribu-
tions to the cross section from these branches, in which
we have included in the usual simple way ([1], p. 49) the
absorptive effects of the imaginary part of the optical
potential.

Our  new  resummation  NF  procedure  clearly  im-
proves the original Fuller NF decomposition, as is evi-
dent in the examples presented here. On the one hand,

ïàåàóÖëäÄü  îàáàäÄ      ÚÓÏ  23      ‹  2      2004

our results confirm the importance of NF decomposi-
tions for gaining insight into the properties of the sub-
amplitudes  responsible  for  complicated  structures  in
cross sections. On the other hand, they confirm the em-
pirical origin of NF decompositions and suggest cau-
tion  in  the  interpretation  of  results  obtained  from  NF
techniques. However, different NF decompositions can
be used to check what parts of the resulting NF subam-
plitudes  are  independent  of  the  particular  technique
used.  Only  properties  stable  with  respect  to  different
NF  decompositions,  can  be  considered  as  manifesta-
tions  of  some  physical  phenomenon.  In  addition,  we
have shown that it is desirable to investigate the behav-
ior of the LAM. This quantity is more sensitive to inter-
ference effects than are the NF cross sections, and a null
value  (or  an  oscillatory  behavior  around  zero)  of  the
LAM in a certain angular range may indicate the dom-
inance of an unphysical contribution.

Further  examples  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  im-
proved  NF  technique,  here  briefly  described,  can  be
found in Refs. [16, 18, 22].

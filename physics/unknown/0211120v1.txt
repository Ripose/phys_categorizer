Abstract 

 
The applications of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) have recently been extended 
by  the  development  of  counters  with  time  resolution  below  100  ps  s  for  minimum 
ionising  particles.  Applications  to  HEP  experiments  have  already  taken  place  and 
many further applications are under study.  

In this work we address the operating principles of such counters along with some 

present challenges, with emphasis on counter aging.

1. Introduction 

Resistive  Plate  Chambers  (RPCs)  with 

time 
resolution  below  100  ps  σ  for  minimum  ionising 
particles  have  been  recently  developed  [1],  [2].  This 
type  of  detector,  operating  at  atmospheric  pressure 
with  non-flammable  gases,  seems  well  suited  for 
systems, 
time-of-flight 
high-granularity 
providing 
the 
to 
scintillator-based  TOF  technology  but  offering  a 
significantly 
lower  price  per  channel,  compact 
mechanics and magnetic field compatibility. A recent 
review may be found in [3].

performances 

Time resolutions of 300 ps FWHM have been also 
demonstrated for 511 keV photon pairs, with possible 
application  to  whole-body  human  PET imaging. The 
sub-millimetric imaging of small animals may be also 
an attractive possibility [4]. 

2. Some considerations on the working principles 

2.1. Efficiency 

It  has  been  recognized  long  ago  that  the  large 
efficiency  values  reached  by  RPCs  for  minimum 
ionising particles (MIPs) cannot be explained without 
form  of  avalanche  growth 
resorting 
saturation, possibly due to the space charge effect [5], 
which  extends  the  sensitive  region  (close  to  the 
cathode).  

to  some 

The width of the sensitive region may be estimated 
by  requiring  that  the  measured  inefficiency  (1-ε) 
equals the probability that a passing particle deposits 
no  ionisation  in  it.  The  required  average  number  of 
“effective” ionisation clusters is then

Figure 1  shows  some  data  on 

timing  RPC 
efficiency  for  different  gases  and  gap  widths  from 
which  N*  and  the  sensitive  fraction  of  the  gas  gap, 
g*/g,  may  be  calculated.  In  all  cases  the  sensitive 
region corresponds to about half of the gap width.

gap  widths  (g)  along  with  the  corresponding  sensitive  fraction  of 
the  gas  gap  (g*/g)  and  the  average  effective  number  of  primary 
clusters  (N*)  per  gap.  Data  for  λ  was  taken  from  [8]  (highly 
relativistic particles). 

2.2. Timing Resolution 

A simple theory of the RPC timing properties may 
be  formulated  on  the  following  principles  (see  also 
[6], [7], [8]). 
The  poissonian  probability  that  k>0  clusters  will  be 
produced  in  the  sensitive  region  of  the  gap  from 
the N* average effective clusters is given by

Avalanches initiated by (in first approximation) single 
electrons will result in an exponentially distributed 
final avalanche charge (Furry law [9]) after a fixed 
development  length1.  Since  the  gain  fluctuations 
occur  mainly  in  the  first  few  amplification  steps 
(see  [8]  for  a  detailed  study)  the  effective  initial 
number  of  electrons,  k,  may  be  replaced  by  an 
apparent value, n, that takes into account both the 
cluster and the avalanche statistics,

statistics has a negligible influence on the time resolution ([6], 
[8]), being reasonable to consider the simplest case.

Owing  to  the  exponential  growth  of  current  in  time 
the  comparator  will  sense  also  an  exponentially

Therefore  the  threshold  voltage  maybe  related  to 
an  equivalent threshold current ith at the amplifier 
input. 

It is assumed that the space charge effect will become 
important only for induced currents larger than ith.

that  this  results  merely  on  a  shift  of  the  time

Figure 4 – Comparison,  based  on  eq.8),  between  the  measured 
average values of α*v (lines) and the counter time resolution (with 
and without charge correction). A reasonable value of K(N*)=0.75 
reproduces well the uncorrected data (compare with Figure 3). 

Presented  in  Figure 4  is  a  comparison  between 
experimental data and the present model. The average 
value  of  α*v  was  determined  using  the  method 
described in [11] along with the time resolution data, 
using  the  setup  described  in  [13].  The  theory 
reasonably  describes 
the  data  when  no  charge 
correction  is  applied  to  the  measured  time.  This  is 
natural,  since  the  time-charge  correlation  was  not 
considered in the model. 

The  present  treatment  expands  upon  previous 
work  [7]  in  that  an  explicit  expression  for  P(τ)  is 
obtained.  This  allows 
the 
distribution  width  by  a  gaussian  adjustment, 
providing  a  more  accurate  comparison  with  the 
experimentally available data.

3. Present challenges 

A  number  of  challenges  still  stand  on  the  way  of 
full-scale  applications  of  high  resolution  TOF  with 
RPCs. Some of the most important ones include: 
- 

a  high-granularity 
RPC-TOF counter is able to operate without loss of 

the  demonstration 

that 

time  resolution  in  a  high  occupancy  environment 
despite potentially large crosstalk levels; 

- 

investigation of the aging effects (see below). 

For  many  applications 

it  would  be  also  of 
fundamental importance the extension of the counting 
rate  capabilities  from  around  200 Hz/cm2  (for  most 
glass-made  counters)  to  much  larger  values  and  the 
development of effective methods for controlling the 
timing tails (see [13] for a possible approach). 

3.1. Aging studies 

Severe  aging  of glass RPCs operating in streamer 
mode  has  been  observed  and  related  to  the  presence 
of  water  vapour  traces  in  the  gas  mixture.  An 
unidentified deposit was found over the glass surface, 
severely increasing the dark count rates and reducing 
the counter efficiency [14]. 

Naturally  it  is  of  great  practical  importance  the 
investigation  of  such  effect  in  timing  RPCs,  often 
made with glass electrodes and working in somewhat 
similar  gaseous  mixtures.  To  this aim we built a test 
setup  comprising  six  single-gap  counters,  each  made 
with  one  glass  and  one  aluminium  electrode.  Three 
counters were connected with the glass electrode as a 
cathode  and  three  were  connected  with  the  glass 
electrode as an anode.  

cathode 

photosensitivities 

All  counters  were  illuminated  laterally,  along  the 
gas gap, by a mercury UV lamp that created primary 
charges  by  photoelectric  effect  at  the  cathodes.  The 
different 
were 
compensated  by  slightly  adjusting 
the  applied 
voltages,  ranging  from  2.8  to  3.0  kV,  until  all 
chambers  registered  similar  current  values.  For  the 
settings  chosen 
the  currents  were  essentially 
independent  from  any  small  variations  in  the  lamp 
intensity, having reached the maximum value allowed 
by the resistive electrode.

currents, 

The  counters  were  illuminated  for  22  hours  and 
kept in darkness 2 hours per day, being continuously 
recorded 
temperature, 
atmospheric  pressure  and  lamp  intensity.  The  setup 
was  kept  in  a  continuous  flow  of  “standard”  timing 
RPC  gas,  C2H2F4+10%SF6+5%iso-C4H10,  being 
added  enough  water  vapour  to  keep  a  10%  relative 
humidity.  The  gas  container  was  made  of  acrylic 
plastic  with  Viton  o-ring  seals  and  several  common 

 

4

types  of  glues,  plastics  and  metals  were  used 
internally as needed. 

4. Conclusions 

Experimental  efficiency  data  shows  that  timing 
RPCs  are  sensitive  to  primary  ionisation  clusters 
created  in  about  half  of  the  gas  gap  (cathode-side). 
For 0.3 mm-gap devices filled with common gases the 
average  number  of  primary  clusters  created  in  this 
region (N*) is close to 1/gap for MIPs. 

A simple, analytically solvable, model of the time 
resolution  suggests  that  it  should  depend  only  on 
some  function  K(N*)  divided  by  α*v.  Multiple  gaps 
are taken in consideration simply through the value of 
N*.  The  model  reproduces  well 
the  available 
experimental data when the charge-time correlation is 
not considered. 

Aging  studies  were  performed  on  six  counters 
made  with  glass  and  aluminium  electrodes.  After  a 
charge  transfer  equivalent  to  800 days  of  normal 
operation  no  increase  of  dark  current  was  detected. 
However  an  unidentified  deposit  was  found  over the 
glass cathodes, being absent on the irradiated regions 
of the glass anodes and on all aluminium electrodes.

Figure  5  –  Dark  current  as  a  function  of  time  and  accumulated 
charge for 6 counters (positive: glass cathode, negative: aluminium 
cathode).  No  systematic  increase  in  dark  current  is  visible, 
contrasting with the aging effect observed in streamer-mode RPCs 
[14].  The  integrated  charge  corresponds  to  800 days of operation 
at the typical counter operational settings. 

The  dark  current  values  recorded  daily at the end 
of 
the  2-hour  dark  period  were  corrected  for 
systematic  variations  due  to  temperature,  being  the 
results for six months of operation shown in Figure 5. 
There  is  no  evidence  of  any  systematic  long-term 
increase  of  dark  current,  suggesting  that  the  aging 
effect mentioned above is less severe in timing RPCs 
than  in  streamer-mode  RPCs.  The  short-term  dark 
current  fluctuations  are  well  correlated  for  the  three 
chambers  of  the  same  type  (glass  or  aluminium 
cathode)  and  therefore  should  be  of  environmental 
origin. 

However,  a  visual  inspection  of  the  electrodes 
confirmed  the  existence  of  a  whitish,  dry,  deposit 
over the glass cathodes. The deposit covered an area 
of approximately 1 cm2 close to the UV-light entrance 
slit,  presumably  corresponding  to  the  effectively 
illuminated region. The glass anodes were also thinly 
covered with a viscous-looking substance everywhere

aluminium electrodes were perfectly clear.

ABSTRACT 

We have demonstrated a 165 micron oblate spheroidal microcavity with free spectral 

range 383.7 GHz (3.06nm), resonance bandwidth 25 MHz (Q≈107) at 1550nm, and finesse F ≥ 104.  

The highly oblate spheroidal dielectric microcavity combines very high Q-factor, typical of 

microspheres, with vastly reduced number of excited whispering-gallery (WG) modes (by two 

orders of magnitude). The very large free spectral range in the novel microcavity  - few hundred 

instead of few Gigahertz in typical microspheres – is desirable for applications in spectral analysis, 

narrow-linewidth optical and RF oscillators, and cavity QED.

Microspherical resonators supporting optical whispering gallery (WG) modes have attracted 

considerable attention in various fields of research and technology. Combination of very high Q-factor 

(108-109 and greater) and sub-millimeter dimensions (typical diameters ranging from few tens to several 

hundred microns), makes these resonators attractive new components for a number of applications, 

including basic physics research, molecular spectroscopy, narrow-linewidth lasers, optoelectronic 

oscillators (OEO), and sensors [1-4]. Effective methods of coupling light in and out of WG modes in 

microspheres are currently being developed, including single mode fiber couplers and integrated 

waveguides [5,6].  

Whispering-gallery modes are essentially closed circular waves trapped by total internal reflection 

(TIR) inside an axially symmetric dielectric body. The very high Q of microspheres results from 1) ultra-

low optical loss in the material (typically, fiber-grade fused silica), 2) fire-polished surface with Angstrom-

scale inhomogeneities, 3) high index contrast for steep reduction of radiative and scattering losses with 

increasing radius, and  4) two-dimensional curvature providing for grazing reflection of all wave vector  

components. Grazing incidence is essential for minimizing surface scattering that would otherwise limit the 

Q far below that imposed by attenuation in the material [7]. For example, in the integrated optical micro-

ring and micro-disk cavities [8] based on planar waveguide technology (the light in planar devices is 

effectively bouncing from flat surfaces under finite angle), typical Q-factor is only 104 to 105.  

The substantially higher Q in the spheres, as compared to micro-disks and micro-rings, comes at the price 

of a relatively dense spectrum of modes. In ideal spheres, the spectrum consists of TE(TM)lmq modes 

separated by “large” free spectral range (FSR) defined by the circumference of the sphere, and related to 

consecutive values of index l. In silica spheres of diameter 150 to 400 micron, the “large” FSR should be in 

the range of 437 to 165GHz, or in the wavelength scale, 3.5 to 1.3nm near the center wavelength 1550nm. 

Each of TE(TM)lmq modes is (2l+1)-fold degenerate with respect to the index m. Residual nonsphericity 

lifts this degeneracy and leads to a series of observable TE(TM)lmq modes separated by “small” FSR in the 

range 6.8 - 2.5GHz, for the same sphere dimensions, center wavelength, and  the eccentricity ε 2 = 3×10-2 , 

typical of current fabrication methods.

A relatively dense spectrum complicates important applications of microsphere resonators, such as 

spectral analysis and laser stabilization, and necessitates using intermediate filtering.  

In this Letter, we demonstrate a microcavity with a novel geometry that retains two-dimensional 

curvature confinement, low scattering loss, and very high Q typical of microspheres, and yet approaches 

spectral properties of the single mode waveguide ring: a highly-oblate spheroidal microcavity, or 

microtorus.   

 

Calculation of the spectrum of the dielectric spheroid (i.e. ellipsoid of revolution) is not a 

trivial task, even numerically. In contrast to the case of small eccentricity (see, for example, Ref.[9]), 

analysis in highly-eccentric spheroids cannot be based on simple approximations. Unlike the case of 

cylindrical or spherical coordinates, orthogonal spheroidal vector harmonics that satisfy boundary 

conditions may not be derived via a single scalar wave function [10]. Furthermore, the calculation of 

spheroidal angular and radial functions is also a nontrivial task.  

 

To analyze the properties of eigenfrequencies, we shall rely on physical considerations; however 

the same approximations can be derived from the asymptotic forms of the spheroidal functions. Very good 

approximation of WG mode eigenfrequencies in dielectric sphere with radius a much larger than the 

wavelength can be found as follows:

where tlq is the q-th zero of the spherical Bessel function of the order l and χ = n for TE-mode and χ = 1/n 

for TM-mode. For large l,  tlq ~ l + O( l1/3 ), and it may be calculated either directly or approximated via the 

zeroes of the Airy function ([11]). The meaning of small second term on the right hand side of  Eq.(1) can 

be understood if we remember that 1) a WG mode is quasiclassically a closed circular beam supported by 

TIR, 2) optical field tunnels outside at the depth

, and 3) the tangential component of E (TE-

mode), or normal of D (TM-mode) is continuous at the boundary. Eigenfrequencies of high-order  WG 

modes (

) in dielectric spheres can be approximated via solutions of the scalar wave equation 

with zero boundary conditions, because most of the energy is concentrated in one component of the field 

(Eθ for TE-mode and Er for TM-mode).

Based on above considerations, let us estimate WG mode eigenfrequencies in oblate spheroids of 

large semiaxis a, small semiaxis b, and eccentricity

more rigorous considerations can follow the approach given in [12]. Taking into account that Tmq ≈  tlq – (l

For very small ε, Eq.(2) yields the same value for “small” FSR (frequency splitting between 

modes with successive m ≈  l) as earlier obtained by the more rigorous perturbation methods in [9]. In 

addition, we have compared the prediction of the approximation (2), l = 100, with numerically calculated 

zeroes of the radial spheroidal functions.  Even with ε = 0.8, the error is no more than 5% in the estimate of 

m, m+1 mode splitting and 0.1% in the absolute mode frequencies. For larger l and smaller ε, the error will 

evidently be smaller. As follows from (2), with increasing eccentricity, “small” FSR – frequency interval 

between modes with successive m – becomes compatible with the “large” FSR:

In our experiment, we prepared a spheroidal (microtorus) cavity by compressing a small sphere of 

low-melting silica glass between cleaved fiber tips. The combined action of surface tension and axial 

compression resulted in the desired geometry (see typical microcavity in Fig.1). One of the fiber “stems” 

was then cut and the whole structure was installed next to a standard prism coupler. The WG mode 

spectrum was observed using a DFB laser near the wavelength of 1550nm.  The laser was continuously 

4 

 

frequency-scannable within the range of ~80GHz (by modulating the current), and temperature tunable 

between 1545.1 to 1552.4 nm. A high-resolution spectrum over 900GHz was compiled from 15 individual 

scans with 60GHz increments obtained by changing the temperature. The frequency reference for 

“stitching” the spectral fragments was obtained by recording the fringes of high-finesse (F ~ 120) Fabry-

Perot ethalon (FSR=30GHz) and additional frequency marks provided by 3.75GHz amplitude modulation 

(Fig.2). Total drift of the FP was less than 400MHz over the full 15-minute measurement time. The 

compiled spectrum is presented in Fig.3. The spectrum is reduced to only two whispering-gallery modes of 

selected polarization excited within the “large” free spectral range of the cavity FSR = 383GHz, or 3.06nm 

in the wavelength domain. The transmission of “parasitic” modes is at least 6dB smaller than that of the 

principal ones. With individual mode bandwidth of 23MHz, the finesse F = 1.7×104 is therefore 

demonstrated with this micro-resonator. We can compare this result with the predictions of our 

approximate expression (2).   For dimensions of our cavity a = 82.5µm, b = 42.5 µm (ε  = 0.86) and the 

refraction index of the material n = 1.453, the principal mode number for TE-modes at the wavelength 

1550nm should be l ≈ 473 and the “large” FSR

In the experimental spectrum, frequency separation between the largest peaks 1 and 2 in Fig.3 is equal to 

383.7 ± 0.5GHz. It may therefore be attributed as corresponding to the small FSR, in good agreement with 

the above estimate, if we take into account an approximately 2% uncertainty in the measurement (limited 

mainly by the precision of geometrical evaluation of cavity dimensions). The separation between the peaks 

3 and 4 in Fig.3, is equal to 400.3 ±  0.5GHz, and is in turn close to the estimate of “large” free spectral 

range.  

It may be argued that despite the large splitting between the modes with adjacent values of index 

m (of the order of “large” FSR), one may still expect a dense spectrum resulting from the overlap of many 

mode families with different principal number l. In practice, however, it is exactly the coincidence in the 

5 

 

frequency domain of WG modes with different main index l, and rapidly increasing difference l – m, that 

should be responsible for effective dephasing of the “idle” modes from the evanescent coupler,  resulting in 

the reduction of modes in the observed spectrum. A complete analytic interpretation is beyond the format 

of this Letter and should include a wider range spectral mapping, a study of microcavities of different 

eccentricity, the calculations of field distribution, and analysis of phase-matched excitation in the 

evanescent coupler.  

In conclusion, experimental results indicate a substantial reduction (up to 2 orders of magnitude) 

in the number of excited WG modes in highly oblate spheroids compared to typical microspheres. This 

reduction in the mode density is obtained without sacrificing the high Q associated with these structures. 

The novel type of optical microcavity demonstrates a true finesse on the order of 104, a free spectral range 

of the order of few nanometers, and a quality-factor Q ~ 1×107. Based on these results, we conclude that a 

complete elimination of “transverse” WG modes maybe expected in spheroidal cavities of higher 

eccentricity. Further increase of the Q and the finesse may also be expected with a refinement of the 

fabrication technique. The decrease in the density of mode spectrum of ultra-high-Q microcavities offers 

new applications in laser stabilization, microlasers, various passive photonics devices, and in fundamental 

physics experiments.

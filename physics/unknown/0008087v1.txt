The disassembly of the Unilac prestripper linac of the
Wideröe  type  took  place  at  the  beginning  of  1999.  An
increase  of  more  than  two  orders  of  magnitude  in
particle number for the most heavy elements in the  SIS
had to be gained. Since that time the new High Current
Injector  (HSI)  consisting  of  H-type  RFQ  and  DTL-
structures  for  dual  beam  operation  was  installed  and
successfully  commissioned.  The  High  Charge  Injector
(HLI)  supplied 
time.
Simultaneously  conditioning  and  running  in  of  the  rf-
transmitters  and  rf-structures  were  done.  The  HSI
commissioning  strategy  included  beam  investigation
after  each  transport  and  acceleration  section,  using  a
versatile  diagnostic  test  stand.  Results  of  the  extensive
commissioning measurements (e.g. transverse emittance,
bunch  width,  beam  transmission)  behind  LEBT,  RFQ,
Super Lens, IH tank I and II and stripping section will be
discussed.  An  40Ar1+  beam  coming  from  a  MUCIS  ion
source  was  used  to  fill  the  linac  up  to  the  theoretical
space  charge

The  original  Unilac  was  not  dedicated  as  a
synchrotron  injector,  fulfilling  all  requirements  due  to
high intensities (especially for mass number above 150).
In 1994 the vision of a new High Current Injector (HSI)
was drafted. This injector should provide an increase of
beam  intensities  by  2.5  orders  of  magnitude  filling  the
synchrotron  up  to  its  space  charge  limit  for  all  ions  –
including  uranium  [1].  An  increase  of  the  accelerating
gain  by  a  factor  of  2.5  is  necessary  to  accelerate  ion
species up to maximum A/q-values of 65 (130Xe2+) within
the  given  length  of  the  former  Wideröe  injector.  For  a
15mA  238U4+  beam  out  of  the  HSI  4(cid:215) 1010  U73+  particles

should be delivered to the SIS during 100m s. This means
that  the  SIS  space  charge  is  reached  by  a  20  turn
injection  into  the  horizontal  phase  space.  The  required
parameters of beam quality are summarised in Tab. 1 for
the uranium case.

2  HSI LAYOUT

The beam of the new High Current Injector is stripped
and  injected  into  the  Alvarez  accelerator,  which  is
approx.  30  years  in  operation  now.  It  was  predicted  by
PARMILA-calculation and confirmed by beam tests that
the  Alvarez  accelerates  highly  space  charge  dominated
ion  beams  coming  from  the  new  HSI  without  any
significant  particle

brilliance [2].

2.1  Ion Source and LEBT section

 1.2ms, £

The HSI is fed by two ion source terminals: One of them
is  yet  since  many  years  housing  a  Penning  ion  source
(PIG),  generating  intermediate  charge  state  ion  beams
with a duty cycle up to 30% (50Hz, 6ms), limited to an
A/q  value  of  24.  The  other  one  is  upgraded  as  a  high
current  terminal;  optionally  the  MUCIS  source  or  the
MEVVA  source  is  installable,  providing  short  intense
macro pulses (£
 16Hz) as required for the linac
operation  with  ion  beams  of  high  magnetic  rigidity
(A/q£ 65) [3]. The existing LEBT [4] section down to the
switching  magnet  was  surveyed  as  basically  useful  for
loss-free  transport  of  high  intense  beams,  assuming  a
high degree  of  space  charge  compensation.  The  section
from  the  switching  magnet  to  the  RFQ  entrance  was
rebuilt  as  a  “50Hz-pulseable”  beamline,  allowing  for  a
two  beam  operation  now.  The  RFQ-matching  condition
of  a  double-waist  at  a  very  small  transverse  beam
diameter  of  5mm  is  accomplished  by  a  quadrupole

quartet. A beam chopper with a rise time less than 500ns
is located close to the entrance of the RFQ.

2.2  36 MHz IH-RFQ and Matching to  IH-DTL

The 9.35m long 36 MHz IH-RFQ [5] accelerates the ion
beam from 2.2 keV/u up to 120 keV/u, where a voltage
amplitude  of  137  kV  and  a  max.  surface  field  of  28
MV/m is necessary  to provide the required accelerating
gain. The postulated mechanical  precision  of  electrodes
[9]  should  be  better  than  0.05  mm  along  each  module,
obtaining  a  high  transmission  rate.  The  time  for  rf-
conditioning  up  to  now  was  less  than  500  h.  The
reduction  of  a  primarily  large  dark  current  contribution
was observed in so much that 90% of the design field are
reached  now  routinely  to  obtain  optimum  operation  for
U4+ beams. The matching to the IH-DTL is done with a
very  short  (0.8m)  11  cell  adapter  RFQ  [6],  with  large
aperture and a synchronous phase of –900 (Super Lens).
The surface field is 26 MV/m at a design vane voltage of
212 kV.

2.3  83 MV IH-DTL

Fig. 2:  A  view  into  IH1:  Four  KONUS  sections,
connected by the three large drift tubes each housing a
quadrupole triplet, can be seen.

The IH-DTL [7] consists of two separate tanks (9.1m
and 10.3m long), connected by an intertank section. The
final  beam  energy  of  IH1  is  0.743  MeV/u,  while  IH2
accelerates  the  ion  beam  to  the  full  HSI-energy  of
1.4 MeV/u.  The  whole  DTL  is  structured  into  six
KONUS  (“Kombinierte  Nullgrad  Struktur”)  sections,
mainly  consisting  of  a  rebuncher  section  operating  at  a

synchronous phase of -350, followed by the acceleration
stage (F
s=00), where the synchronous particle is injected
with a surplus in energy resulting in a high accelerating
rate. Finally in each section a quadrupole triplet provide
the transverse focusing. Tank 1 houses four accelerating
sections  with  three  internal  triplet  lenses  as  shown  in
Fig.2.  Behind  the  external  triplet  tank  2  contains  two
accelerating  sections  and  one  external  triplet  between.
The  rf-conditioning  of  the  structures  results  in  lower
dark  current  contributions  regarding  rf  power  losses
when compared to the more critical RFQ.

2.4  1.4 MeV/u and 11.4 MeV/u stripper section

Two  quadrupole  doublets  match  the  1.4  MeV/u  HSI-
beam  to  the  gas  stripper  [8].  No  additionally  focusing
device  is  necessary  to  feed  the  new  charge  state
separator  system.  If  as  a  worst  case  a  15mA  U4+  ion
beam  is  stripped,  U28+  should  purely  separated  from  the
neighbouring  charge  states  under  extremely  high  space
charge  conditions  (105  emA  total  pulse  current).  After
the rebuilt of the stripper region a multi-pulse mode [9]
from  the  different  injectors  is  possible.  In  the  11.4
MeV/u  stripper  region  [10]  of  the  transfer  line  to  the
synchrotron  the  beam  power  in  case  of  an  intense
uranium  beam  is  approximately  as  high  as  in  the  gas
stripper  section.  In  order  to  cope  with  the  potentially
disastrous  beam  load  on  the  stripper  foil  a  magnetic
sweeper  system  had  been  established,  saving  the  foil,
while  a  significant  decrease  of  beam  quality  due  to
stripping  effects  should  not  occur.  A  new  short  charge
state separator system, to be installed directly behind the
foil stripper, is still under construction.

3  RF SYSTEM

Supplying  the  36  MHz  structures,  rf  amplifiers  with  a
peak power of about 2 MW had to be installed, while the
27 MHz rf equipment became dispensable. Additionally
redesigned fast amplitude- and phase controls were built
along the whole Unilac, enabling the operation with high
beam  loading.  The  five  200  kW  amplifiers  were
externally  built  (TOMCAST  AG,  Switzerland)  and
partly utilised as pre amplifiers for the 2 MW end stages
and  as  rf  provider  for  the  Super  Lens  and  a  rebuncher.
The  in  house  developed  end  stages  are  powered  by  the
Siemens tetrode RS2074 SK; they feed the RFQ and the
two IH cavities. The assembly of all rf-components took
place just in time and the whole system shows excellent
reliability [11], [12].

4  BEAM DIAGNOSTIC TEST BENCH
A  mobile  test  bench  [13]  was  designed  and  already
used for the stepwise performed beam commissioning of
LEBT, RFQ, Super  Lens  and  IH-DTL.  It  was  equipped
with in part newly designed beam diagnostics, as shown
in  Fig.3:  four  segmented  capacitive  pick-up  probes,

beam transformers, a profile grid in combination with a
non-destructive residual gas ionisation profile monitor, a
slit-grid emittance measurement device, as well as a first
time  used  pepperpot  system  and  a  particle  detector  for
bunch structure observation. At the end of the test bench
the beam was dumped in a cooled Faraday cup.

operation  started  end  of  November,  just  in  time  as
scheduled  a  long  time  in  advance;  the  milestones  of
mounting and commissioning are summarised in table 2.

was done in 6 steps, each subsequently completed with a
“two week beam-commissioning period”. Regular beam

After  each  step  the  correct  beam  energy  was  verified
by a time of flight measurement using the signals of two
pick-ups in a well-known distance. As an example Fig. 4

melting and evaporation of hit material after some m s - it
is necessary to limit the rise time of the macro pulse to a
value  as  short  as  possible  [9].  As  shown  in  Fig.5  the

measured  rise  time  of  the  phase  probe  signal  after  the
RFQ  is  of  the  same  amount  as  the  design  value  of  the
chopper  (0.5  m s).  No  significant  increase  of  rise  time
takes  place  along  the  whole  HSI,  demonstrating  good
working rf control loops with respect to beam loading of
the  cavities.  Macro-pulse  shape  investigations  were
carried out for Ar1+ close to the current limit, as well as
for many different other  ion  species  and  intensities  (for
example  6.5 mA  238U4+  from  the  MEVVA  source  [15])
and showed no considerable difference.

current  by  a  beam  transformer  behind  of  the  RFQ  as  a

intensity  case  (18  mA)  in  such  a  way  that  the  design
current limit of 10 mA was reached [16]. The controlled
intensity  reduction  was  done  by  cutting  the  horizontal
phase  space  distribution  with  slits  and  without  any
tuning  of  the  RFQ matching,  resulting  in  full  particle
transmission  from  4 mA  downwards.  The  transmission
decrease to roughly 55 % at the theoretical current limit

problems  due  to  space  charge  effects  or  misalignment
inside the RFQ are not ruled out to lead to particle loss.
The  RFQ  is  the  bottleneck  as  figured  out  and  emerged
by many measurements; the transmission of the IH-DTL
is better than 90% over a wide range of beam intensities
and ion species (Fig. 6, beneath). For the U4+ case 3 mA
after 
the  particle
transmission is close to the amount  of  the  space  charge

reproducibility of position and amount of the transverse
emittance at the HSI exit is better than 4 % (verified by

measured  by  the  additional  rf-power  needed  for  the

Measurements  of  the  transversal  emittance  for  the
several  energy  steps  of  the  HSI  (and  at  11.4  MeV/u)
were  done  exclusively  with  a  slit-grid  device  for  short
pulses.  The  input  emittance  was  measured  before  the
quadrupole  quartet.  For  120 keV/u,  750 keV/u  and  1.4
MeV/u  the  beam  was  transported  to  a  measurement
device in the gas stripper region [17]; another device  is
placed  after 
the
measured emittance data for an Ar1+ beam with 10 mA at
RFQ  injection  and  6.5 mA  at  the  HSI  exit.  The  Ar10+
current  (after  stripping  and  charge  state  analysis)  came
up  to  7 mA  by  gas  stripper  density  variation.  The
measurements  agreed  to  the  calculation  [18],  if  a
measuring error of about – 15 % is taken into account.

passes  a  thin  Au-foil  –  the  “Rutherford“-scattered
particles hit the detector below a small angle. The bunch
shape  is  obtained  by  measuring  the  arrival  time  of  the
particles against a reference [19]. It was even possible to
observe 
typical  “zero  current”  phase  space
distribution  in  longitudinal  plane,  leading  to  intensity
peaks in the center and at the beginning (resp. at the end)
of the measured bunch shape. This effect is still present
after accelerating the beam up to 0.743 MeV/u, and after
transport  to  the  stripper  region  (Fig.  8).  Regardless  the
higher defocusing due to space charge forces in the high
current  case  the  bunch  is  shorter  and  without  the
significant  “low  current“-structure.  At  full  HSI  energy
the  beam  is  very  well  bunched.  Independently  from
space  charge  effects  along  the  HSI,  the  bunch  is  small
enough  to  be  matched  to  the  poststripper  by  the  two
rebunchers  operated  at  36  MHz  and  108  MHz,
respectively.

7  CONCLUSION

The  new  High  Current  Injector  was  mounted  and
commissioned  with  great  success.  The  measured  beam
parameters,  as  energy,  bunch  width,  energy  spread,
transverse emittance fit very well to the calculation. The
transmission at beam currents  up  to  40 %  of  the  design
intensity is close to 100%. Significant particle losses due
to insufficient understanding problems are observable at
the space charge limit. Within the intrinsic error bars of
measurement  the  emittance  growth  in  the  high  current
case is as predicted by simulation. So far the rf levels are
high enough to provide a stable operation with U4+. First
beam  experiments  with  medium  uranium  intensity,
feeding  the  HSI  with  the  MEVVA  beam,  showed  no
significant  deterioration  of  beam  quality.  Since
November 1999 the HSI delivers beam to experiments in
routine operation.

It  is  hard  to  believe  that  converting  an  act  into  an  idea
often turns out to be rather sophisticated (Karl Kraus) –
vice versa by the help of numerous people at GSI and at
collaborating institutes…

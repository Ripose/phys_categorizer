Oscillating integrals often arise in the theoretical description of phenomena in chemical physics, in particular
in atomic and molecular collisions, and in spectroscopy. A computer code for the numerical evaluation of the
oscillatory cuspoid canonical integrals and their first-order partial derivatives is described. The code uses a nov-
el adaptive contour algorithm, which chooses a contour in the complex plane that avoids the violent oscillatory
and exponential natures of the integrand and modifies its choice as necessary. Applications are made to the
swallowtail canonical integral and to a bessoid integral.

More generally, oscillating integrals frequently arise
in  the  theory  of  water,  geophysical,  electromagnetic
and acoustic waves, as well as in the scattering of heavy
nuclear ions. Many references to relevant research can
be found in references [1–3].The evaluation of these os-

cillating integrals is often done using uniform asymptot-
ic techniques [1, 2, 4]. Then an important problem is the
numerical computation of certain canonical integrals
and their first order partial derivatives. The simplest
examples  involve  the  cuspoid  canonical  integrals,
which arise in the uniform asymptotic theory of oscil-
lating  integrals  with  2,  3,  4,  …,  n  coalescing  saddle
points [1–4].

For two coalescing saddles, the canonical integral
is  the  regular  Airy  function  (or  fold  canonical  inte-
gral):

with u and the ak real and n an integer greater than 2.
The name of Cn(a) arises because fn(a; u) is a miniver-
sal unfolding of a cuspoid singularity (also called an
An – 1  singularity)  [1–4].  The  importance  of  the  inte-
grals (1)–(4) can be seen from the fact that the forth-
coming  Digital  Library  of  Mathematical  Functions
will  contain  a  chapter  entitled  “Integrals  with  Coa-
lescing Saddles” [7].

The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  describe  a  com-
puter code for the numerical evaluation of integrals
of the type (1)–(4), and to present some illustrative
results. The computer code is called CUSPINT and
it  uses  an  algorithm  in  which  the  integration  path
along the real axis is replaced by a more convenient
contour in the complex u plane, rendering the oscil-
latory integral more amenable to numerical quadra-
ture. 

Only  an  outline  of  the  algorithm  is  presented
since  full  details  can  be  found  in  reference  [3].
Numerical results are presented for |S(x, y, z)|. In ad-
dition, some results are shown for the bessoid inte-
gral [8]

where x and y are real and J0(…) is the Bessel func-
tion of order zero. The bessoid integral (5) charac-
terizes  cuspoid  focusing  when  axial  symmetry  is
present [8].

Section 2 outlines three general methods for the nu-
merical  evaluation  of  cuspoid  and  bessoid  integrals.
The  adaptive  contour  algorithm  used  in  CUSPINT  is
described in section 3. Results for |S(x, y, z)| and J(x, y)
are presented in section 4.

2.  METHODS
FOR  THE  NUMERICAL  EVALUATION 
OF  OSCILLATING  INTEGRALS

There  are  three  general  methods  available  for  the
numerical evaluation of infinite oscillating integrals of
the type (1)–(5).

a) Maclaurin series. Maclaurin series expansions of
(1)–(5)  converge  for  all  values  of  x,  y,  …  However,
they are cumbersome to use when |x|, |y|, … are large
because of cancellation and slow convergence.

b) Differential equations. This method derives a set
of differential equations to which Cn(a) or J(x, y) is a
solution  and  then  solves  the  equations  numerically.
There  are  several  advantages  associated  with  this
method:  the  derivatives  are  obtained  automatically
and it is an efficient way of generating grids of values
for use in plotting. Disadvantages include: the deriva-
tion of the differential equations and their initial con-
ditions is non-trivial; the method is difficult to imple-
ment on a computer for the case of general n; for cer-
tain values of x, y, … the independent solutions of the
differential  equations  are  exponentially  increasing,
thereby  limiting  the  accuracy  to  which  the  integrals
can be calculated.

For P(x, y) it is only necessary, in practice, to solve
numerically  one  differential  equation  [9,  10]  and  this
method has been used by Kaminski and Paris [11] to

of x and y (see also [12]). But for Cn(a) with n > 4, the
disadvantages of the differential equation method be-
come serious.

c) Contour Integral method. Since the integrand of
Cn(a) is infinitely oscillating along the real axis, a direct
numerical evaluation is not possible. However, by de-
forming the contour of integration into the complex u

plane we can make the integrand more amenable to a
numerical quadrature. This method has the advantage
that it is efficient, gives high accuracy results, is rela-
tively easy to implement on a computer and can be gen-
eralized to other types of oscillating integrals such as
J(x, y).

The first step is to write the general cuspoid integral

where

Next we observe that the integrand of equation (6)
is infinitely oscillating along the real axis making a di-
rect numerical evaluation impossible. However, we can
use the ray from 0 to ∞exp(iπ/2n) as a new contour of
integration. This does not change the value of 
(a), as
follows from an application of Cauchy’s Theorem and
Jordan’s Lemma, using the fact that the integrand is en-
tire. The new contour has the advantage that the inte-
grand  eventually  becomes  exponentially  small,  like
exp(–tn) with t real, which suggests that a numerical ap-
proximation to 

(a) should be possible.

However, there is still a problem [13]: for certain
values of the coefficients, ak, the integrand can pos-
sess violent oscillations along the new contour, before
it becomes exponentially small. This is a serious dif-
ficulty,  which  can  prevent  the  accurate  numerical

The contour 

 proceeds from the origin along the

real axis to a breakpoint, 

. The second contour

is (usually) a straight line, which joins the point

 lies

along the original direct ray and joins

The  quadratures  along 

  are  per-
formed  in  CUSPINT  using  specialist  quadrature  rou-
tines, especially suited to oscillating non-singular inte-
grands.  In  particular,  two  versions  of  the  code  have
been  written:  the  first  version  uses  the  subroutine
D01AKF  present  in  the  NAG  Program  Library  [14],
while  the  second  version  uses  the  subroutine  DQAG
and dependencies from the QUADPACK Program Li-
brary [15].

Reference  [3]  describes  how  CUSPINT  chooses

values for 

 and M+ for a given error tolerance. One

+
R0

problem that can arise is that the integral along 
 is
still oscillatory and difficult to evaluate numerically.
To mitigate this problem, we can “cut the corner” and
break away from the real axis at a point R+, which is

+
C1

closer to the origin than is 

. The integration along

+
R0

 is then replaced by one along a new straight-line
exp(iπ/2n)  –  see

,  which  joins  R+  to

contour, 
Fig. 1.

CUSPINT uses an iterative process which modifies
the value of R+ depending on the success, or otherwise,
+
of the quadratures along 
. This is possible
C1
because D01AKF and DQAG have powerful error de-
tection facilities. CUSPINT acts on errors returned by
the quadrature subroutines and modifies the contour of
integration accordingly, i.e. an adaptive contour algo-
rithm is used.

 and

CUSPINT  is  written  as  a  FORTRAN  90  module.
Reference [3] describes in detail the input, output and
error control flags, along with driver programs for test
runs and the results that are produced.

4.  APPLICATION  TO  THE  SWALLOWTAIL 
AND  BESSOID  OSCILLATING  INTEGRALS

This section presents results for two oscillating inte-
grals: the swallowtail integral S(x, y, z) and the bessoid
integral J(x, y).

Figures  2–4  show  grey  shaded  perspective  views
of  |S(x,  y,  z)|  for  x  =  4.0,  0.0  and  –6.0  respectively.
Each  plot  required  22 378  numerical  evaluations  of
S(x,  y,  z)  using  the  grid  –20.0(0.3)29.8  for  z  and
−20.0(0.3)19.9 for y. The plots are symmetric about
the  line  y  =  0  because  of  the  relation  S(x,  –y,  z)  =
= S*(x, y, z). The swallow’s tail is clearly visible in
Fig. 4. A detailed discussion of the structure in these
plots can be found in references [10, 16] along with
a description of the caustic surface, which acts as a
“skeleton” upon which is built the “wave flesh” as-
sociated with S(x, y, z).

Figure 5 shows a perspective and contour plot of
|J(x,  y)|.  This  plot  required  6561  numerical  evalua-
tions of J(x, y) on the grid –8.0(0.2)8.0 for x and –
8.0(0.2)8.0 for y. The corresponding contour plot for
argJ(x, y)/deg is displayed in Fig. 6. Both plots are
symmetric about the line y = 0 because of the relation
J(x, y) = J(x, –y). Reference [8] contains a detailed
discussion of the structure in the plots displayed in
Figs. 5 and 6.

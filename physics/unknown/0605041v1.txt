Abstract. New measurements are presented of the lift on a spinning baseball.  The experiment 
utilizes  a  pitching  machine  to  project  the  baseball  horizontally; a  high-speed  motion  capture 
system to measure the initial velocity and angular velocity and to track the trajectory over ~5 
m of flight; and a ruler to measure the total distance traversed by the ball.   Speeds in the range 
v=50-110  mph  and  spin  rates  (topspin  or  backspin)  ω=1500-4500  rpm  were  utilized,  corre-
sponding to Reynold’s numbers Re=(1.1-2.4) x 10  and spin parameters Rω/v=0.1-0.6.  Stan-
dard least-squares fitting procedures were used to extract the initial parameters of the trajec-
tory  and  to  determine  the  lift  and  drag  coefficients.    Comparison  is  made  with  previous 
measurements  or  parametrizations  of  the  lift  and  drag  coefficients,  and  implications  for  the 
effect of spin on the flight of a long fly ball are discussed.

1 Introduction to the Problem 

In a recent paper, Sawicki et al. (Sawicki, Hubbard, and Stronge 2003) report a study 
of the optimum bat-swing parameters that produce the maximum range on a batted 
baseball.  Using a model for the ball-bat collision and recent experimental data for 
the  lift  and  drag  coefficients,  they  tracked  the  ball  from  collision  to  landing.      For 
given initial parameters of the pitch (speed, angle, and spin), the bat swing angle and 
undercut distance were varied to maximize the range.  The study found the surprising 
result that an optimally hit curveball travels some 12 ft. farther than an optimally hit 
fastball, despite the higher pitched-ball speed of the fastball.  The essential physics 
underlying  this  result  has  to  do  the  with  the  aerodynamic  lift  force  on  a  baseball 
projected with backspin.   In general, a baseball will travel farther if it projected with 
backspin.  It will also travel farther if is projected with higher speed.  In general a 
fastball will be hit with a higher speed.   However, a curveball will be hit with larger 
backspin.  The reason is that a curveball is incident with topspin and hence is already 
spinning in the right direction to exit with backspin.  A fastball is incident with back-
spin so the spin direction needs to reverse to exit with backspin.  It then becomes a 
quantitative question as to which effect wins:  the higher speed of the fastball or the 
larger backspin of the curveball.  According to Sawicki et al., hereafter referred to as 
SHS, the latter effect wins and the curveball travels farther. 
  The conclusion of SHS depends critically on the size of the lift force on a spin-
ning baseball.   SHS used a particular model for the lift based largely on experimen-

tal data that will be reviewed in the next section.   That model and the conclusions 
that follow have been criticized by Adair (Adair 2005), who claims that SHS grossly 
overestimate  the  effect  of  spin  on  the  flight  of  a  baseball.    The  goal  of the  present 
paper is to resolve the disagreement between SHS and Adair, hereafter referred to as 
RKA, by performing new measurements of the effect of spin on the flight of a base-
ball.  We first present a more detailed discussion of the differences in Section 2.  Our 
experiment, including the data reduction and analysis, is described in Section 3.  Our 
results are compared to previous determinations of the lift and drag in Section 4 and 
the implications for the flight of a baseball are discussed.  We conclude with a sum-
mary in Section 5.  

2 Previous Determinations of Lift 

 

 

 

 

When a spinning baseball travels through the atmosphere, it experiences the force of 
gravity in addition to the aerodynamic forces of drag and lift, FD and   FL.  Conven-
tionally these forces are parametrized as

  FD= ½CD ρAv2      FL= ½CL ρAv2   

(1) 

where A is the cross sectional area of the ball, v is the speed, ρ is the air density, and  
CD  and CL are the drag and lift coefficients.   SHS and RKA have distinctly different 
prescriptions for CL.   SHS uses the parametrization 

SHS:   CL = 1.5S  (S<0.1)  

 

 

 

 

 

= 0.09 + 0.6S  (S>0.1) 

(2)  

where S=Rω/v is the so-called spin parameter.  Eq. 2 is based on the data of Alaways 
(Alaways 1998; Alaways and Hubbard 2001) and Watts and Ferrer (Watts and Ferrer 
1987).  The Alaways experiment used a motion capture technique to determine the 
initial conditions of a pitched baseball and to track the trajectory, from which CL and 
CD could be determined for speeds up to approximately 75 mph and for 0.1<S<0.5.  
Watts  and  Ferrer  measured  the  lift  force  directly  from  force  probes  mounted  on  a 
spinning ball in a wind tunnel.  They measured CL only at low speed (v<37 mph) but 
with S in the range 0.4-1.0.   The SHS parametrization is a rough bilinear fit to both 
sets of data.  RKA uses the parametrization (Adair 2002) 

RKA:  CL  = 2CD S[1 +0.5(v/CD )dCD/dv]   

 

 (3) 

which  follows  from  the  argument  that  the  lift  on  a  spinning  ball  is  related  to  the 
difference in drag between two sides of the ball which pass through the air at differ-

ent surface speeds due to the rotation, an argument first posed by Sir Isaac Newton.  
RKA  argues  that  Eq.  3  leads  to  lift  values  which  are  in  good  agreement  with  the 
Watts and Ferrer data at low speed, where CD is relatively constant and equal to

about 0.5.   Indeed, under these conditions Eqs. 2-3 imply CL=0.21 or 0.20 for SHS 
or RKA, respectively, for S=0.2.  RKA further argues that extending this prescription  
to higher speeds leads to predictions in reasonable agreement with observations from 
the  game  itself  (Adair  2002),  such  as  the  maximum  break  of  a  pitched  curveball.  
However,  it  is  precisely  at  high  speeds—speeds  that  are  typical  of  pitched  or  hit 
baseballs—that the differences between SHS and RKA are most pronounced.  This is 
demonstrated in Fig. 1, which shows the calculated ratio of lift to weight as a func-
tion  of  speed  for  ω=1800  rpm.        While  the  two  curves  agree  quite  well  below  40 
mph, they diverge for larger speeds, so that in the vicinity of v=100 mph (S≅0.154), 
the lift is about three times larger for SHS than for RKA.  This will have dramatic 
implications for the distance traversed by a long fly ball. 

3 Description of the Experiment 

The essential technique is to project the ball approximately horizontally with back-
spin or topspin and to use a motion-capture system to measure the initial velocity and 

 
 
 
 
 

Alan M. Nathan et al.

angular  velocity  and  track  the  trajectory  over  approximately  five  meters  of  flight.  
Under such conditions, the vertical  motion is particularly sensitive to the lift force, 
which leads to a downward acceleration smaller or larger than g when the ball has 
backspin or topspin, respectively.  Additional information is obtained by measuring 
the  total  distance  traversed  by  the  baseball  before  hitting  the  floor,  which  is  ap-
proximately  1.5  m  above  the  initial  height.    The  projection  device  was  an  ATEC 
two-wheel  pitching  machine,  in  which  the  speed  of  the  ball  is  determined  by  the 
average tangential speed of the two wheels and the spin is determined by the differ-
ence in the two tangential speeds.   In the present experiment, we investigated speeds 
in  the  range  V=50-110  mph  and  spin  rates  ω=1500-4500  rpm,  corresponding  to 
Reynold’s  numbers  Re=(1.1-2.4)  x  105  and  S=0.1-0.6.    A  total  of  22  pitches  were 
analyzed, all in the “two-seam” orientation. 

3.1 Motion Capture Technique 

To  measure  the  initial  velocity  and  angular  velocity  of  the  ball,  a  motion  analysis 
system was used.  The system, manufactured by Motion Analysis Corporation, con-
sisted of 10 Eagle-4 cameras operating at 700 frames per second and 1/2000 second 
shutter  speed  and  the  EVaRT4.0  reconstruction  software.    Each  camera  shines  red 
LED light onto the ball, attached to which is circular dot of retro-reflective tape.  The 
tape reflects the light back at the cameras, which then record the coordinates of the 
dot in the CCD array.  The reconstruction software determines the spatial coordinates 
in  a  global  coordinate  system  by  using  triangulation  among  the  10  cameras.    The 
cameras were positioned at various heights along a line approximately parallel to and 
six meters from  the line-of-flight of the ball.  In order to accomplish the triangula-
tion,  the  precise  position  and  lens  distortions  of  each  camera  must  be  determined 
from  an  elaborate  calibration  scheme.    The  global  coordinate  system  is  defined  by 
positioning  an  L-shaped  rod  in  the  viewing  volume  of  the  10  cameras  simultane-
ously.  The rod has four reflective dots located at precise relative locations to each 
other.    With  these  distances,  the  software  determines  a  first  approximation  to  the 
location of each camera.  These distances are further refined and the lens distortions 
determined by waving a wand throughout the tracking volume of the cameras.  The 
wand has three reflective dots at known relative distances.   Although the particular 
calibration software is proprietary, it almost surely uses some variation of the direct 
linear  transformation  technique  described  by  Abdel-Aziz  and  Karara  (Abdel-Aziz 
and  Karara  1971)  and  others  (Heikkila  and  Silven  1997).    A  typical  root-mean-
square (rms) precision for tracking a single dot is 1.3 mm.  Additional calibrations 
and consistency checks were performed.  A plumb line was used to establish that the 
y-axis  of  global  coordinate  system  made  an  angle  of  0.160  with  the  vertical.    The 
clock of the motion capture system was checked against a precisely calibrated strobe

light  and  found  to  be  consistent  within  0.5%.    A  non-spinning  baseball  was  tossed 
lightly in the tracking volume and the vertical acceleration was measured to be g to 
within 1.5%.   
  The setup for this experiment is similar in many respects to that used in the pio-
neering experiment of Alaways (Alaways 1998) but different is some key respects.  
One difference concerns the deployment of cameras.  Alaways used two sets of mo-
tion capture cameras.  One set tracked the ball over the first 1.2 m of flight and was 
used to establish the initial conditions; a second set tracked the center-of-mass trajec-
tory  over  the  last  4  m  of  flight,  starting  approximately  13  m  downstream  from  the 
initial position.  This allowed a very long “lever arm” over which to determine the 
acceleration  but  a  short  lever  arm  for  determining  the  initial  spin.    In  the  present 
setup, we used only one set of cameras distributed spatially so to track over the larg-
est distance possible, approximately 5 m.  The same set of cameras determined both 
the initial conditions and the acceleration.  Tracking over a larger distance is useful 
for measuring the spin at small S, since the angle through which the ball rotates over 
distance D is proportional to SD.  For all of the pitches analyzed in the current ex-
periment,  the  ball  completed  at  least  one  complete  revolution  over  the  tracking  re-
gion.    We  gained  some  redundant  information  by  measuring  the  total  distance  R 
traversed by the baseball while falling through a height of  about 1.5 m.  The second 
difference  concerns  the deployment  of  reflective  markers.    Alaways  utilized  4  dots 
on the ball with precisely known relative positions.  This allowed him to determine 
both the initial orientation of the ball and the direction of the spin axis.  We experi-
enced great difficulty in tracking more than one dot and therefore used only a single 
dot, offset from the spin axis by approximately 150.  We were not able to measure the 
spin axis but simply assumed it was constrained by the pitching machine to lie in the 
horizontal  plane,  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  motion.    New  measurements  are 
planned for early 2006 using multiple dots and those results will be reported at the 
conference. 

3.2 Data Reduction and Analysis 

A plot of y(t) and z(t) for one of the pitches is shown in Fig. 2, where y and z are the 
vertical and horizontal coordinates, respectively, of the reflective marker.  Standard 
nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithms were used to fit these data to functions of 
the form 

y(t) = ycm(t) + Asin(ωt+φ)  

 

z(t) = zcm(t) ± Acos(ωt+φ)

where the first term on the righthand side is the center of mass coordinate of the ball 
and the second term is the location of the rotating dot with respect to the center of 
mass.    The  center  of  mass  motion  can  be  calculated  numerically  given  the  initial 
values of the ycm and zcm positions and velocities and the lift and drag coefficients.  
The rotation of the dot is characterized as an oscillation with amplitude A, angular 
frequency  ω,  and  initial  phase  φ,  with  the  +/−  sign  applying  for  backspin/topspin.   
Therefore, our fitting procedure was used to determine nine parameters:

the  four  initial  values,  the  three  rotation  parameters,  and  CL  and  CD,  both  of  were 
assumed  to  be  constant  over  the  5  m  flight  path.    Depending  on  the  initial  speed, 
each fit had 100-300 degrees of freedom, including the range R.   Our analysis pro-
cedure is quite similar to that used by Alaways.  The curves in Fig. 2 are the results 
of the fit to the data.  The rms deviation of the fit from the data in Fig. 2 is 0.4 mm 
for  y(t)  and  12.7  mm  for  z(t),  which  values  are  typical  of  the  fits  for  the  other 
pitches.  The  inferred  values  of  CL  and  CD,  which  represent  the  main  results  of  our 
experiment,  are  presented  in  Figs.  3-4.    The  error  bars  on  the  values  are  estimates 
based on the rms deviation of the data from the fit and the calibration tests.

including the data of Alaways, Watts and Ferrer, and Briggs (Briggs 1959), as cor-
rected by  Hubbard  (Sawicki  et  al.  2005).   In  the  region  S<0.3, which  is  the  region 
most relevant for long fly balls, our data are in excellent agreement with SHS and the 
earlier data.  In fact, only for S>0.5 do our results start to deviate from SHS, which is 
constrained  primarily  by  the  high-S  data  of  Watts  and  Ferrer,  most  of  which  were 
taken at speeds below 25 mph.   Interestingly, the present data near S=0.5 agree with

Alaways and are below the general trend of the Watts and Ferrer data.  Perhaps this 
is an indication of a dependence of CL  on v, for a fixed S.  On the other hand, the 
bottom  plot  of  Fig.  3  shows  the  correspondence  between    v  and  S  for  the  present 
experiment.  In the range S=0.15-0.30, the values of CL are tightly clustered around 
0.20, despite a variation in v between 50 and 110 mph.  This seems to suggest only a 
weak  dependence  of  CL  on  v,  at  least  in  that  regime.    Also  shown  in  Fig.  3  is  the 
parametrization of RKA for a speed of 100 mph, a speed typical of a well-hit ball.  In 
the vicinity of S=0.17, corresponding to a backspin of 2000 rpm, the RKA curve falls 
well below the data. We conclude that the present data support SHS and do not sup-
port RKA.

Our  results  for  CL  are  shown  in  Fig.  4.  Also  shown  are  the  SHS  and  RKA  (Adair 
2002)  parametrizations  and  the  motion  capture  data  of  Alaways  (Alaways  1998).   
There  is  considerably  more  scatter  in  our  results  for  CD  than  for  CL,  reflecting  the 
generally larger rms deviation of the fit for z than for y.   It is easy to see from Fig. 2 
that our technique is much more sensitive to CL, which is determined by the

nearly  completely  masked  by  the  large  linear  term.    Therefore  any  comments  we 
make about CD based on the present data must be considered speculative. That said, 
our results are not in agreement with SHS but they in rough agreement with RKA.  
Interestingly, our results agree very well with the Alaways motion capture data in the 
regime  where  they  overlap  below  80  mph,  and  neither  observed  a  large  dip  in  the 
region of 70-90 mph, the so-called drag crisis.  The dip comes from an analysis of 
high-speed  video  of  pitched  baseballs  from  the  Atlanta  Olympics  (Alaways,  Mish, 
and Hubbard 2001).  On the other hand, the  motion capture data in the 70-80 mph

range  generally  were  taken  with  considerably  larger  spins  (4000  rpm)  than  found 
with  pitched  baseballs.      This  supports  the  notion  of  spin-dependent  drag  (Adair 
2002) which might smooth out the drag crisis, giving a curve more similar to RKA 
than to SHS. 
 

4.3  Implications for the Flight of a Baseball 

 
Finally we explore briefly the implications of our results for the flight of a baseball.  
In Fig. 5 a calculation is shown of the maximum range for a hit baseball as a function 
of the takeoff angle for three different parameterizations of lift and drag.  The solid 
curve uses SHS for both lift and drag; the short-dashed curve uses RKA for both lift 
and drag; and the long-dashed curve uses RKA for drag and SHS for lift.  The latter 
prescription is the one most consistent with the present data.   

5 Summary and Conclusions 

We have performed an experiment utilizing high-speed motion capture to determine 
the effect of spin on the trajectory of a baseball.  From these data, we determine with 
good precision values for the CL over the range 50<v<100 mph and 0.1<S<0.6.   Our 
CL is in excellent agreement with the SHS parameterization for S<0.3 but falls below 
SHS  for  larger  S.    Our  results  are  not  consistent  with  the  RKA  parameterization.  
With considerably less precision, we have also extracted values for CD,  which do not 
support a sharp drag crisis in the 70-90 mph range.

Abstract  
 
Herein a process of suitable extraction of energy from vacuum is 
introduced. By following Ridgely’s idea[1],  it is proposed some 
molecular  fine-scale plates. Then some properties of them are 
considered. In fact Casimir effect is viewed in engineering manner. The 
introduced plates may be applied for support of traversable wormholes 
(TWs) & warp drives (WDs). 
 
Introduction  

 
Herein the basic idea is the introduction of flat Casimir plates in nano 
scale however changing for engineering reasons, (e.g circle, washer) 
always remain parallel to themselves. Herein it is followed Ridgely who 
proposed an approach leading to creating macroscopic amounts of exotic 
matter (EM) [1]. People who work in field know existence of EM or in 
other words negative energy (NE) is “almost” necessary for TWs & WDs. 
The word “almost” is because there is comment about violation of weak 
energy condition (WEC) with no need to EM such as creation & control 
of massive scalar or massless scalar [2,3,4,5,6,7,8], nutrino[9,10,11], 
Brans-Dicke (BD)[12], & so on fields[13,14]. But they don’t seem to 
delete engineering problems which an advanced civilization [15] must do 
for creation , stabilization & control of TWs or WDs completely. Herein 
it is shown nano scale plates may be useful. Also some properties are 
imputed to plates and scene. At last conclusion is if we have enough 
plates, proper configurations may give us suffician amount of NE.

as a result it can be mentioned if zero point field (ZPF) performs positive 
work in a localized region of spacetime then NE density of the system 
arises. By the way, there is no difference between inertial properties of 
EM & common matter. 
 

      Properties of suitable Casimir plates: 

 
Let’s assume a pair of flat structures (plates) which are composed of 
some conductive quantums. For our purposes a few properties of plates & 
condition are desired: 
 
A: The shape of plates should be square or rectangular or circular. Square 
is because easy calculation but circular is for more output of collection 
(fig 1). As reader knows circle is the extreme area in a flat plate. By the 
way due to 
2LU ∝
 
B: According to [16] dependence of Casimir energy to mass is described 
by: 

increasing the area is very important.

here µ denotes mass for the scalar field. So less massive quantums 
(molecules or atoms) , more output of collection. 
 

C: The “plates” should be as much as possible “flat” & a proper topology 
must be available. So molecules should be as much as possible tiny in 
particular if there are a few of them. 
 
D: The plates should be light because zero point energy should be 
extracted more and more & a little of it should move the plates. 
 
E: The plates should be as much as possible thin because more volume of 
vacuum need to be covered and dug 
 
F: Evidently more conductive plates is better & superconductivity  
should be considered. 
  
G: All factors leading to friction should be diminished to all forces be 
conservative. Less wasting is more needed. 
  
H: According to [16] there is a contrary dependence between Casimir 
force & growing temperature:

So temperature of the surrounding should be low. 
 
Can we extract NE from vacuum? 
 
The calculations show with a reachable number of plates it can be 
produced sufficient NE (dependent to elegance of operation from ~ 
hundreds to bilions number of plates & distance between them from pico-
meters to nano-meters) we can produce needed EM at least for the case 

reported in[17]. The calculations are under consideration & will be 
published in my next letter.

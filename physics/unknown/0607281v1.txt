Abstract 

We  study  second  harmonic  generation  in  a  planar  dielectric  waveguide  having  a  low-

index,  polymer  core  layer,  bounded  by  two  multilayer  stacks.  This  geometry  allows 

exceptionally  strong  confinement  of  the  light  at  the  fundamental  wavelength  inside  the 

core  region  with  virtually  zero  net  propagation  losses  for  distances  that  exceed  several 

centimeters,  provided  material  and  scattering  losses  are  neglected.  A  phase-matched 

configuration  of  the waveguide  is  reported in  which  the pump  signal  is  the  lowest-order 

mode of the waveguide, and the generated second harmonic signal corresponds to the third 

propagation  mode  of  the  waveguide.  Using  a  polymer  waveguide  core,  having χ(2)  ~100 

pm/V,  we  predict    a  conversion  efficiency  of    approximately  90%  after  a  propagation 

 

1

distance  of  2  mm,  using peak  pump  intensities  inside  the  core  of  the  waveguide  of  1.35 

GW/cm2.    If  the  waveguide  core  contains  polymer  layers  with  different  glass  transition 

temperatures, the layers can be poled independently to maximize the overlap integral, and 

similar pump depletions may be achieved over a distance of approximately 500 microns. 

1. Introduction 

Optical  second  harmonic  generation  (SHG)  has  been  intensively  studied  and 

demonstrated both in bulk and waveguide configurations.  For strong SHG, the interacting 

fields at the fundamental and second harmonic (SH) wavelengths should be well confined 

and  overlapped  inside  the  structure.  Usually,  the  length  of  any  device  devoted  to  obtain 

highly efficient SHG is limited by the phase-mismatch between the waves involved in the 

nonlinear  process.  When 

the  phase-matching  condition 

is  achieved,  conversion 

efficiencies can be large by simply increasing the interaction length.  

 

If  the  dispersion  is  not  too  strong,  high  conversion  efficiencies  can  typically  be 

achieved by resorting to the quasi-phase-matching (QPM) technique [1], where a periodic 

modulation  of  the  second  order,  nonlinear  susceptibility  tensor  compensates  the  phase-

mismatch  between  waves  traveling  at  different  phase-velocities.  It  was  recently 

demonstrated [2,3] that enhanced SHG may be obtained in 1-dimensional photonic crystal 

devices by tuning both the fundamental and SH signals near their respective band edges: 

geometrical and material dispersions may be combined and exploited to tune the effective 

phase matching conditions near the band edge, where the density of mode is high for both 

fields [2].      

In this paper we show that it is possible to achieve phase-matched SHG by guiding 

the  pump  field  energy  in  an  ordinary,  quadratic  nonlinear  material,  sandwiched  between

two Bragg-like mirrors constituted by one-dimensional, sub-wavelength thick, multilayer 

structures.  The  operation  of  such  a  waveguide  in  the  linear  regime  is  based  on  Bragg 

confinement rather than total  internal reflection  (TIR), or step-index guiding,  and allows 

low-loss and single-mode propagation of the electromagnetic field, which is trapped into 

the  high-nonlinear-coefficient  region.  This  wave-guiding  mechanism,  first  discussed  by 

Yeh  and  Yariv  [4],  is  exploited  in  Bragg  reflection  waveguides  (BRW),  as  well  as  in 

micro-structured  photonic  crystal  fibers  (PCF),  or  hollow  fibers  [5,6],  which  typically 

display two-dimensional photonic band gap (PBG) confinement of the light into the fiber 

core.  Recently,  a  photonic-crystal  Mach-Zehnder  modulator  based  on  this  wave-guiding 

mechanism,  surrounded  by  metal  electrodes,  was  proposed  [7].    The  device  showed 

exceptionally  high  confinement  and  low-loss  properties,  effectively  reducing  electrode 

separation  by  at  least  a  factor  of  two.  BRW  can  also  support  nonlinear  guided  wave 

propagation,  with  a  third-order  nonlinear  medium  either  in  the  core  region  [8],  or  in  the 

high-index  films  of  the  cladding  [9].    In  this  paper,  we  suggest  the  use  of  photonic-

crystals-assisted  waveguides  to  achieve  highly-efficient  SHG  by  exploiting  field 

confinement and effective phase matching conditions between the pump and the generated 

second  harmonic  signal  in  the  core  region,  a  low-index  medium  such  as  a  polymer,  for 

example, possessing a quadratic nonlinear coefficient.  

 

The  linear  propagation  properties  of  this  particular  type  of  waveguide  strongly 

depend on the multilayer-cladding design, whose geometry and refractive indices uniquely 

determine transverse photonic band gaps (PBG) in the linear transmission spectrum of the 

waveguide [7]. Here, we use the beam propagation method (BPM) to analyze a structure 

of  finite  transverse  and  longitudinal  extent.  A  numerical  study  of  the  geometrical 

properties  of  the  structure  and  effective  refractive  index  dispersion  reveals  that  nearly 

 

3

exact phase matching can be achieved between the fundamental and the SH signals.  Thus, 

we predict  highly efficient SHG by simply  molding the  effective index properties  of the 

cladding, without the need of introducing a grating inside the core [e.g. 10].  In particular, 

our  calculations  show  that  a  1.35  GW/cm2  pump  signal  may  be  almost  completely 

depleted after propagating approximately 2 mm inside the waveguide. 

 

In  waveguide  geometries,  phase  matching  can  be  achieved  by  using  higher  order 

modes  at  the  SH  frequency  to  compensate  for  material  dispersion.  Using  higher  order 

modes to achieve phase matching degrades the overlap of the fundamental and SH fields. 

Khurgin  [11]  suggested  that  by  appropriately  inverting  the  nonlinear  domains  along  the 

transverse  coordinate,  the  overlap  integral,  and  hence  conversion  efficiency,  could  be 

further  optimized.  In  ref.  [12]  a  waveguide  core  consisting  of  two  nonlinear  polymer 

layers having different glass transition temperatures, allowed for sequential poling of the 

individual layers composing the core. These inverted domains in the transverse direction 

provide a large overlap integral for the fundamental and SH fields. As we will show in the 

following,  photonic-crystal-assisted  waveguides  in  combination  with  modal  phase 

matching and sequential poling can provide extremely large conversion efficiencies.

reference medium of the structure, for both the fundamental and SH wavelengths. 

Substituting  expression  (2)  in  the  wave  equation  (1),  and  after  separating  the  terms 

oscillating  at  ωF  from  those  oscillating  at  2ωF,  we  obtain  the  following  scalar  system  of

So  far  the  only  assumption  we  have  made  is that  the  fields  are  monochromatic  and  TE-

polarized.  In a waveguide environment, the complexity of equations (3) may be reduced 

by  assuming  that  the  refractive  index  has  discontinuities  only  along  the  transverse 

direction x, and that it is uniform along the direction of light propagation z. This allows us 

to neglect the second order longitudinal derivatives of the fields, and to solve the parabolic 

or Fresnel problem, defined as follows

    (4) 

The  system  (4)  is  solved  using  the  split-step  Fast-Fourier-Transform  beam  propagation 

method  (FFT-BPM)  [13-14],  which  has  been  extended  to  include  the  simultaneous 

propagation of two fields, the fundamental and the SH, coupled via the quadratic nonlinear 

susceptibility.  Using  this  method,  we  are  also  able  to  fully  describe  the  dispersion 

properties  of  the  structure  that  we  analyze  .  The  procedure  used  to  determine  the 

eigenvalues  and  eigenmodes,  which  is  described  in  [14],  is  based  on  the  correlation 

function between the electric field propagating through the waveguide, and the source, or 

input  electric  field.  This  technique  is  applied  by  considering  the  linear  behavior  of  the 

waveguide, thus separating the fundamental and the second harmonic equations of motion 

by  removing  the  nonlinear  coupling  terms  in  (4).  The  eigenvalues  of  the  waveguide 

correspond  to  the  maxima  of  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  above  mentioned  correlation.

The basic structure we analyze is schematized in Fig.1: dark regions correspond to 

the  high-refractive-index  medium.  The  period  Λ   of  the  lateral  Bragg  mirrors  and  the 

index contrast

the longitudinal linear transmission of the waveguide. As pointed out in Ref. [7], the width 

of the transmission bands increases when the index contrast in the lateral cladding regions 

is  larger.    Assuming  material  and  scattering  losses  due  to  lattice  imperfections  may  be 

neglected,  propagation  losses  in  the  waveguide  decrease  by  increasing  the  number  of 

periods. Moreover, it was shown [7] that the waveguide performance, in terms of losses 

over transmission and reduction of design complexity, is good when only two media are 

considered,  instead  of  three,  as  in  the  most  general  case.  The  structure  we  propose  is 

constituted by a core layer (refractive index 

n
c

(ω )
F

=

at the fundamental wavelength, 

typical for polymers) 2 μm thick. The claddings are composed of periodic arrangements of 

semiconductor  layers (refractive  index 1(ω )
F

n

=

3.2

) and  polymeric  layers;  the  period  is 

Λ =

300

nm, and each layer is 150 nm thick. The number of periods is N=6, and the total 

thickness of the structure is less than 4  μm.   We assume that the refractive index of the 

polymer  at  the  SH  wavelength  is 

n
c

(2ω )

F

=

1.6283

,  consistent  with  a  chromatic 

dispersion  of  approximately  1.8%,  a  typical  but  by  no  means  unique  range  for  ordinary 

polymers.     

 

For  such  a  waveguide,  the  longitudinal  transmission  spectrum,  i.e.  propagating 

along z in Fig. 1,  is shown in Fig. 2 for a wide range of wavelengths.  For our purposes it 

is enough for the input signal to be propagated for approximately 1 cm.  For this analysis 

we  excite  the  waveguide  with  a  transverse  field  profile  that  corresponds  to  a  cosine 

function  within  the  guiding  layer.  This  represents  a  good  approximation  of  the  shape  of 

the  lowest-order  propagating  mode  [7].  For  the  linear  transmission  study  we  use  this 

 

7

cosine-shaped input for the entire spectrum that we consider, including waves involved in 

the  nonlinear  process.  In  doing  so  we  are  able  to  fully  describe  the  transmission  and 

dispersion properties of the waveguide, including higher order modes. Referring to Fig.2, 

interacting signals are chosen within the two different longitudinal pass-bands shown, and 

they  propagate  well-confined  by  the  lateral  mirrors  as  the  high  transmission  suggests. 

Propagation losses are exceptionally small, predicted to be less than 0.005 dB/cm for the 

fundamental  signal  [7],  and  approximately  an  order  of  magnitude  smaller  for  the  SH 

signal.  Some of this loss is due to the fact that the input field (the cosine function) is a 

good approximation but does not perfectly match the eigenmode profile.   

 

Then  we  separately  study  the  modal  dispersion  of  this  waveguide  for  the 

fundamental wavelength  λ

1064

nm, and SH wavelength  λ

F =

SH =

532

nm. In Fig. 3 the 

modal  powers  are  plotted  on  a  logarithmic  scale  as  functions  of  the  effective  refractive 

index  for  the  fundamental  (solid  line)  and  SH  (dashed  line)  wavelengths,  respectively. 

These  curves  show  that  the  waveguide  supports  multimode  propagation,  but  the  lowest-

order  mode  carries  by  far  (several  orders  of  magnitude)  the  largest  amount  of  modal 

power.  Moreover,  it  is  evident  that  the  waveguide  produces  a  phase-matching  condition 

between  the  TE0  mode  at  λ

F =

1064

nm,  the  TE2  mode  at  the  SH  wavelength 

λ

SH =

532

nm,  so  that  the  third  peak  of  the  SH  modal  power  spectrum  (dashed  line  in 

Fig.3),  falls  in  almost  precisely  the  same  spectral  position  of  the  TE0  mode  at  the 

fundamental  wavelength  (first  peak  in  the  continuous  line).  The  corresponding  effective 

refractive index value is 

effn =

1.5795

. An important feature of this waveguide is that the 

magnitude  of  the  effective  refractive  index  for  the guided  mode  can  be smaller  than  the 

individual refractive indices in each layer. This is due to the Bragg nature of the guiding 

system,  so  that  the  lateral,  multilayer  stacks  act  as  mirrors  for  the  light  inside  the  core 

 

8

region, thus yielding an effective refractive index smaller than the index in the core region.  

This reduction of the effective refractive index was pointed out in reference [2] for one-

dimensional  PBG  structures,  but  for  excitations  normal  to  the  layer  interfaces,  at 

frequencies inside photonic band gap.  The lower effective refractive index comes about 

thanks  to  the  onset  of  anomalous  geometrical  dispersion,  which  compensates  natural 

material  dispersion.    Therefore,  using  the  geometry  external  to  the  guiding  layer  one  is 

able  to  compensate  for  material  and  modal  dispersions  to  the  extent  that  nearly  exact 

phase matching can be achieved.   

 

The  transverse  profiles  of  the  two  interacting  modes  are  reported  in  Fig.4.  The 

phase-matching  in  this  waveguide  is  also  confirmed  by  examining  the  dispersion  curves 

(Fig.5) of the effective refractive index for the TE0 mode near  λ

F =

1064

nm, and the TE2 

mode  near  λ

SH =

532

nm.  We  note  that  these  curves  are  obtained  using  the  method 

outlined  in  section  2  above.  However,  an  independent  calculation  of  the  dispersive 

properties  of  the  guide  using  an  analytical  model  based  on  mode  matching  at  each 

interface yields almost identical results. 

Using  a  pump  intensity  peak  Iω=1.35  GW/cm2,    the  conversion  efficiency 

η

=

/P
2ω

P
ω

  is  about  90%  after  a  propagation  distance  of  2mm,  as  depicted  in  Fig.6, 

where the cross-sectional power of the fundamental and SH fields are plotted as a function 

of the propagation distance z. 

The structure that we have studied is by no means unique, and it is optimized for a 

pump  wavelength λ

F =

1064

nm.  However,  geometrical  dispersion  makes  it  possible  to 

shift  the  operating  wavelength  of  the  waveguide,  thus  shifting  the  phase-matching 

condition,  by  simply  varying  the  cladding  layers  thicknesses.  In  general,  the  phase-

matching wavelength is red-shifted when the width of the layers increases.  For instance, 

 

 

 

9

we  found  that  for  layers  180  nm  thick  the  phase-matched  wavelength  is  1.085  μm.  Of 

course,  when  the  periodicity  of  each  multilayer  stack  is  changed  (and  they  may  be 

changed  independently),  particular  attention  has  to  be  devoted  to  changes  in  the 

longitudinal transmission spectrum.  

 

An  examination  of  Fig.  4,  which  shows  the  transverse  field  distributions  at  the 

fundamental and second harmonic frequencies, suggests that it may be possible to further 

enhance the conversion efficiency by appropriately inverting the nonlinear domains along 

the  transverse  coordinate  to  maximize  field  overlap  [11,12].  In  Fig.  7  we  compare  the 

conversion  efficiency  for  three  different  structures:  (i)  one  coherence  length  of  core 

material;  (ii)  a  photonic  crystal  assisted  waveguide  with  an  unprocessed  core  500  μm-

long;  (iii)  same  as  (ii),  but  with  a  transversely  poled  core.  The  result  of  the  transverse 

poling  is  a  dramatic  improvement  of  the  second  harmonic  conversion  process:  a  1.35 

GW/cm2  input  pump  beam  may  become  nearly  depleted  after  a  propagation  distance  of 

only 500 microns.   Alternatively, the same 2mm-long waveguide may almost completely 

deplete an 80 MW/cm2 pump signal. 

Conclusions 

We have shown second harmonic generation in a photonic-crystal-assisted waveguide in a 

mode  dispersion  phase  matching  configuration.  The  high  Bragg-like  confinement  of  the 

interacting  waves  provided  by  the  periodic structures  in  the  cladding  regions  makes  this 

waveguide  particularly  interesting  for  highly-efficient  nonlinear  processes  in  low-

refractive index media, such as polymers. The conversion efficiency for a waveguide with 

a  uniformly  poled  polymer  core  waveguide  is  about  90%  using  a  1.35  GW/cm2  input 

pump  power  and  a  2  mm  long  device.  For  waveguide  cores  containing  two  or  more 

 

 

10

polymer  layers  with  different  glass  transition  temperatures,  the  application  of  transverse 

poling  to  maximize  field  overlap  leads  to  a  device  capable  of  depleting  a  1.35  GW/cm2

peak  is  the  power  carried  by  a  guided  mode.  Lower  order  modes  correspond  to  higher 

refractive index positions. 

Fig.4:  Profiles  of  the  mode  intensities  at  the  fundamental  (continuous  line)  and  second 

harmonic  (dashed  line)  wavelengths.  The  fundamental  signal  is  a  TE0  mode,  the  phase-

matched SH mode is a TE2.  The alternation of the sign of χ(2) refers to transverse poling 

of  the  structure,  discussed  in  section  three,  to  further  improve  the  overlap  integral  and 

overall conversion efficiencies. 

Fig.5:  Dispersion  curves  for  the  TE0  (continuous)  and  TE2  (dotted)  modes.  The 

wavelength axis for the TE2 mode is multiplied by a factor two. The open circle denotes 

the phase-matching wavelength, λ=1.064 μm. 

Fig.6: Pump (solid line) and SH (dashed line) powers versus interaction length. The power 

of  the  input  pump  signal  is  1.35  GW/cm2.  The  pump  is  depleted  after  2  mm  of 

propagation. 

Fig.7:  SHG  efficiency  versus  pump  power  for  three  waveguides.  The  dotted  line  is 

relative  to  a  one-coherence-length-long  waveguide,  constituted  by  a  polymeric  core 

surrounded by  air.  The  dashed  line  corresponds  to  the photonic-crystal-assisted,  500μm-

long  waveguide.  The  solid  curve  is  the  efficiency  obtained  by  transversally  poling  the 

photonic-crystal assisted waveguide.

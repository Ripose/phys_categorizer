Abstract. Solving the H-problem could well be of historical interest but a solution must be unambiguous. We use 
already available and accurate spectral evidence to contradict and even to flaw the current CERN H-experiments, set 
up to unravel this H-mystery. Making H with a long-range interaction between e+ and p- is impossible, since this mass-
asymmetrical pair of charge-conjugated antiparticles is confined to a bound state at close-range. This resembles the 
short- and long-range quark behavior in QCD. A real solution for H will therefore require a different approach.

 H* 

Introduction 
Left-right asymmetry in naturally observed stable systems has a long history. With the seminal 
works of Pasteur in the 19th century, chiral behavior became of scientific interest. But only a 
century after chemists, physicists realized the importance of chirality for simple neutral particle 
systems. Today, there is a growing interest in the properties of H for a variety of reasons [1]. 
Imaging an internal particle-structure for atom hydrogen seems simple. With charge conjugation 
symmetry C, H (particles e-,p+), allowed in nature is transformed in its mirrored version H 
(antiparticles e+,p-), forbidden in nature. Consequently, one expects that neutral antimatter H 
annihilates when it meets neutral matter but claims exist that mass-producing H seems possible [2]. 
At CERN, one attempts to produce artificial antihydrogen H* [1,2] with combination reaction 
e+ + p-   
 
which, at first sight, seems perfectly logical and valid beyond any doubt.  
Known problems with interacting antiparticles are (a) the possibility that they show a different 
short- and long-range behavior, like quarks which are unstable at long but stable at short range, 
and (b) the effect of system symmetries. Perfectly symmetrical pairs of charge-conjugated 
particles, with the center of charges cC coinciding with the center of mass cM like in positronium or 
antiprotonium, are known to annihilate. But if cC does not coincide with cM like in (1), quasi-bound 
systems can be formed, where annihilation is, at least, delayed as demonstrated for instance with 
antiprotonic helium [3]. 
The CERN-based H-approaches [1,2] rely on the conventional belief that combination reaction 
(1) must lead to antihydrogen H [1,2]. Reaction (1) seems justified since it is an exact mirror copy 
of the corresponding formation reaction for hydrogen H 
e-  +  p+ 
which is a natural, reversible and valid process. If (1) were really a valid consequence of (2) due to 
C and/or P, there is no need at all to question the work by ATHENA and ATRAP [1,2]. The 
trust of the physics community in the reliability of approach (1) is so great [1] that it is difficult to 
imagine different or alternative solution(s).    
But there is a case for which it can be proved with absolute certainty that reaction (1) is impossible: this is when 
natural antihydrogen H-states exist [4-8]. This theoretical possibility explains why artificial antiH in (1) 
is denoted as H*, whereas natural hydrogen-states are referred to with symbol H. As we will 
show below, the crucial natural case H can only be understood with a quark-like model. 
Unlike for artificial H*, for which direct signatures have not yet been provided [1,2], the many 
concrete signatures for natural H-states are overwhelming: (a) evidence in the band spectrum of 
over 300 diatomic bonds, including molecular hydrogen in particular, which proves that intra-
atomic charge-inversion occurs in nature [4,5], is indeed confirmed by (b) supporting 
complementary evidence in the line spectrum (Lyman-series) of natural atomic hydrogen [6-8]. Both 
complementary signatures provide with generic and system independent criteria for chiral behavior of 

↔    H

natural species hydrogen. In concreto, it is easy to derive a Mexican hat curve from the known 
spectrum of natural H to prove the chiral behavior of this simple neutral species [7,8]. An inverse 
Mexican hat curve is equivalent with a classical Van der waals-Maxwell-curve, probing and 
detailing the reversible natural H-H phase transition in the so-called simple Coulomb electron-
proton bond [8].  
Whereas these latter signatures provide direct evidence for natural H-states [4-8], most of the 
evidence claimed for artificially produced H* (1) is indirect and necessarily based upon complicated 
annihilation patterns and their interpretation [1,2].  
Not even the slightest direct signature for H* has yet been presented by the ATHENA or 
ATRAP collaborations [1,2]. To identify positively a species in an experiment, only its spectral 
characteristics can provide conclusive evidence. This logic is strictly obeyed in standard analytical 
chemistry (see example [9]) and should apply equally well for CERN-H*-experiments. But the 
H*-spectrum is not yet known, since measuring this spectrum is exactly the main goal of [2], 
which could even make all claims on H*-production thus far reported [1,2] premature. In 
addition, Driscoll recently showed [10] that some of the preliminary results reported thus far 
perfectly fit in available theories for antiparticle plasma’s. 
Because of this indirect not-conclusive evidence for H* [2] and the direct conclusive evidence for H 
[4-8], the possibility even remains that H* was not produced at all [9], mainly due to annihilation on the 
spot. In essence, all claims [2] are based upon the general conventional belief that (1) is plausible when 
compared with (2) but a rigorous proof for the absolute validity of (1) was never given. 
 
Natural or artificial antihydrogen: H or H* 
With direct evidence [4-8], neutral species hydrogen can exist in 2 mutually exclusive quantum states, a 
natural atomic hydrogen or H- and an equally natural but charge-inverted anti-atomic antihydrogen 
H-state. A reversible phase transition between these 2 left- and right-handed states can be 
described schematically as 
HL (H) ↔  [Hcrit] ↔  HR (H)  
an internal phase transition in a bound state between enantiomers HL (H) and HR (H). This left-right 
distinction or the chiral behavior of natural species hydrogen is due to charge-inversion C [4,5], which is also 
the result of applying P to the atomic dipole. Reversible transition (3) can only be triggered by a 
field-effect (heat, radiation…), i.e. by a perturbation of achiral intermediary and critical state Hcrit 
in between HL and HR.   
Chirality related process (3) also has a long history as a similar transition applies for chiral 
behavior of real stable structures (enantiomers), discovered by Pasteur in the 19th century. A 
classical stable chemical left handed structure ABCDL can go over, in a continuous manner, into 
a right handed structure ABCDR, through a process described accurately with CCMs, continous 
chirality measures [10]. In between the two enantiomers L and R, a critical, non-chiral or achiral 
state ABCDcrit appears, exactly as indicated in (3) [11]. 
With generic scheme (3) based upon [4-8], flawing (1) is possible, pending the order of states H 
and H with respect to Hcrit. In fact, HR or atomic H is known to dissociate in an electron and a 
proton, as argued with classical and valid equation (2). But with (3), allowing electron and proton 
to get closer and closer, they will have to adapt to form critical achiral configuration Hcrit, the result of 
a perturbation of the 2 unit charge Bohr H-structure. Further compression beyond achiral Hcrit 
can provoke a permutation of the 2 unit charges to give a different handedness for a very closely bound 
and stable positron-antiproton system, denoted by H (or HL) in (3).   
If the classification (order) of mutually exclusive natural states H and H in (3) is proved to be in 
line with observed reaction (2), (1) must be invalidated immediately. With mutually exclusive 
states ordered exactly as in (3), HL (or natural H) can never dissociate directly in e+ + p-, which makes 
reverse combination reaction (1) impossible indeed for any natural and stable H-state. Before 
dissociating, HL(or natural H) must first adapt according to critical achiral Hcrit, which means its 
charges must invert as in normal Bohr-like H. If so, (1) used in [2] can never lead to natural H

directly: Hcrit is the barrier, which prevents reaction (1) to be possible2 and simply contradicts any 
claim based upon [2]. 
It appears that, with natural H-states, approaches (1) and (3) are mutually exclusive too, since, if 
one of the two is valid, the other must be excluded: only one anti-atomic species H(e+,p-) can 
exist with intra-atomic charge inversion as it is confined to short-range only. As a result, if (1) 
leads to something like H* as claimed by [2], this artificial structure can never be identical with 
natural H. 
An important difficulty with (1) is that it is just the result of a general convention, rather than of 
scientific reasoning. As a matter of fact, mainly by convention, only the artificial CERN-based approach 
(1) is allowed in nature, while more natural (3) is excluded, despite the abundant spectroscopic evidence in its favor 
[4-8]. 
Strictly spoken, it is impossible, without explicit proof, to forbid one of the two schemes (1) and 
(3) a priori. But a simple and straightforward phenomenological analysis of the H-line spectrum 
(the Lyman series) fixes critical achiral state Hcrit at ncrit=π [6-8]. The other chiral states are classified 
easily: H-states are confined to domain n>π, in line with (2), whereas H-states must be to the left 
of Hcrit as in (3), where n<π [6-8]. Critical n-values related to number π are consistent with de 
Broglie’s standing wave equation [6]. Model (3) for the reversible H-H transition is confirmed 
experimentally by the available line spectrum of natural hydrogen [6-8]. The intra-atomic charge 
inversion itself is proved with the band spectrum of molecular hydrogen [5]. As a result, (1) is 
impossible, because the existence of a critical intermediate achiral complex Hcrit is not accounted 
for in the CERN-approach [2].  
Only a reversal of the order of H- and H-states in (3) could come to the rescue for (1), since this 
would make reaction (1) allowed. But reversing the order of mutually exclusive states leads to 
meaningless results, rebutted by the logic behind scientific metrology and observation and by 
pure common sense, as is easily proved with two examples. The oldest one is even pre-quantal, 
since it is the classical macroscopic phase transition between two ordered or classified different 
states of aggregation of the same species [8]. 
 
Reversing the order of two mutually exclusive states is always forbidden  
Let us discuss some consequences of ordering mutually exclusive states or phases. For 2 mutually 
exclusive states or phases to exist, they must be distinguishable in a field, say on a 1D semi-axis, 
for if not, they are degenerate. A distinction of states by a field implies an order, a classification.  
(a) A Schrödinger cat has 2 mutually exclusive states, dead and alive, since, by definition, alive = not 
dead. This excludes the possibility that a cat is partially dead and partially alive or, which is 
equivalent, that a cat is in both states at the same time. Only a transition from completely alive to 
completely dead is an allowed phase transition for a cat, seemingly similar to (3). On the field or time 
semi-axis, the transition from alive to dead is allowed with increasing time but only in this order 
(irreversible transition). The inverse transition (dead to alive) for a single cat on the same time 
semi-axis is forbidden. On semi-axis +t, a permutation (inversion) of marks alive and dead for a 
single cat is not allowed, as it does not make sense.  
Inverting the order of the marks alive and dead on the +t semi-axis would lead to stupid results: a 
living man, looking back in time, would see he was already dead. 
(b) In a reversible phase transition, the order of states is as important as in (a). Let us replace the 
semi-axis +t by a volume axis +V (the field effect) and look at a macroscopic gas-liquid transition 
with the Van der waals-equation of state (EOS) [8]. Gas and liquid states for a single species are 
as mutually exclusive as dead and alive for a cat or as two discrete quantum states. Even in a 
mixture, each individual molecule must belong either to the liquid or to the gaseous state, as it 
cannot be in two different states at the same time. During a liquid-gas phase transition, the main

properties of the unit species, say molecule H2O, are not affected. While transforming from gas 
to liquid with the two phases temporarily in coexistence, the characteristic temperature (100 °C) 
or the pressure in the P,V-diagram cannot change, according to the Gibbs phase rule. It is trivial 
however that at very large V, the system is normally in the gaseous state. Only when V decreases by 
compression, the gas-liquid transition can set in and eventually lead to the liquid phase for the 
complete system, whereby V for the liquid is always much smaller than for the gas. Also here, the domains for 
gas and liquid in the P, V-diagram can never be inverted. The borderline is determined by the intermediary 
maximum pressure Pcrit, in the P, V-diagram [8]. This critical maximum distinguishes between a domain where 
the pressure increases (+) and one where the pressure decreases (-), eventually to end in a domain of negative 
pressures, difficult to understand with classical physics.  
Exactly as in (a), inverting marks for gas and liquid on the +V-axis leads to the same stupid 
results: with an inversion of states of aggregation, one would obtain a gas by compressing (or cooling) a liquid. 
With these trivial examples, it is obvious that, marks or domains attributed to 2 mutually exclusive states or 
phases for the same species can never be inverted on the same field axis. Once the properties of its states or phases 
on the field axis have been defined by measurement or observation, their permutation is not allowed.  
This explains why the 2 mutually exclusive states for species hydrogen in (3) cannot be inverted 
either. As a consequence of the same logic, (1) would be impossible indeed. 
 
Mutually exclusive hydrogen- and antihydrogen-states on the field axis 
These trivial but stringent examples are further quantified with a typical Van der waals-curve 
focusing on the phase-transition itself, as shown in Fig. 1. The P, V-curve has an intermediary 
critical maximum Pcrit, corresponding with a critical volume Vcrit, important for the gas-liquid 
transition. The borderline between gas and liquid domains contains point +Pcrit, crosses the +V-
axis at +Vcrit and runs parallel with the P-axis as indicated in Fig. 1. It is evident that, once the +V 
semi-axis is fixed, the permutation of gas (VR>Vcrit) and liquid (VL<Vcrit) domains is forbidden. 
With model (3), the liquid-gas phase transition on the +V semi axis obeys the order 
 
VL (liquid)  ↔  [Vcrit] ↔  VR (gas) 
In Fig. 2, we show the generic schemes (without the quantitative fine structure of Fig. 1) for the 
+t semi-axis and the mutually exclusive cat states alive and dead. A similar scheme applies for 
model (3) with the +n semi axis to describe the states available for atomic species hydrogen. If n 
is Bohr’s principal quantum number, large n or n>ncrit means a large separation for electron and proton 
(pseudo-gaseous state, low particle density). When n decreases, electron and proton will form the 
conventional Bohr H-atom (higher particle density), according to (2) and in agreement with 
observation. In terms of liquid and gas, the Bohr-atom must be placed at the right-hand side of 
Hcrit with ncrit =π (playing the role of Pcrit and Vcrit for liquid and gas in (4) and in Fig. 1). Expanding 
the Bohr H-atom (increasing n further) cannot but lead to e- + p+, in agreement with standard 
reaction (2). As H is confined to n<ncrit (see above), (1) is flawed as suggested in the preceding 
section, unless 
(i) H is indeed different from H* (see above) or unless  
(ii) Fig. 1 does not apply to chiral model (3) for natural hydrogen. 
 
Why CERN H*-experiments must be flawed immediately 
It is obvious that something very elementary seems wrong with the finer quantitative details of 
the Van der waals-curve as depicted in Fig. 1. In fact, it is impossible to measure negative pressures. 
According to Maxwell, the surface described by the positive pressure domain, above the 
condensation line, must match exactly that by the negative pressure domain below it. Classically, 
the data points drawn in Fig. 1 are not assessable by experiment but, as shown elsewhere [8], the data 
points given explicitly in Fig. 1 are actually measured with relatively great spectroscopic accuracy.  
The underlying reason is that macroscopic energies PV correspond with energies of type 1/r if 
the force is of type 1/r2 [8]. Replacing the volume V by an inter-particle separation r for a 
Coulomb attraction –e2/r between 2 charge-conjugated particles like electron and proton and the

perturbing field kT by hν=hc/λ, leads to the same logic for a lepton-baryon system disturbed by 
radiation as that for a macroscopic liquid-gas system, provided there is a critical separation at ncrit, 
corresponding with Hcrit in (3). So the quantitative picture generated by the Van der waals-
equation for a macroscopic phase transition (4) can equally well apply for the microscopic phase 
transition in a neutral quantum system (3) [8], as remarked in the Introduction. 
But the most remarkable thing about the fine structure given in Fig. 1 is that all the data points on the curve 
therein are simply extracted from the Lyman series of natural atom H, available for many a decade [7,8]. In fact, 
the curve is the inverted Mexican hat potential, detected previously [7,8]. The subtle difference between the two is a 
representation of the data, either plotted versus 1/n (giving a Mexican hat curve) or versus n (giving a Van der 
waals-curve) and a very small asymptote shift [8].  
Analytically, this difference transforms ncrit=π in the Mexican hat potential in a critical state for n 
between 5 and 6, as indicated in Fig. 1, the further details of which are given in [8].  
The immediate consequence is that the natural H-domain is now proved to be confined to n<ncrit 
and to the left of Hcrit, as indicated in (3). With the same logic of the examples (a) and (b), 
inverting the marks for H and H on the +n-axis is not allowed as it would lead to equally stupid 
results. The domain for natural H is confined n<ncrit, with ncrit=π for achiral state Hcrit in (3) in the 
Mexican hat representation of [7].  
If we were to expand natural H from n<ncrit by increasing n, the system reorganizes until it first 
reaches ncrit or critical achiral state Hcrit. After passing that critical configuration, it has 
transformed (by charge-inversion [5]) in natural Bohr-like H, which after further expansion, produces 
conventional result electron e- and proton p+, exactly as described by natural process (2). 
With (3) and the Mexican hat potential [7], it is even a simple matter to determine the energy of 
the critical state Hcrit,. If the harmonic Rydberg [6,7] is used as asymptote, the value for the 
maximum at ncrit=π separating the two wells is 
∆E(Hcrit) = 0,044667 cm –1 
 
(error of order 10-5). Detailed information of this type for H, not yet available and even 
unthinkable with [2], proves why our results indeed run ahead of the CERN experiments, as argued 
before [6,7]. When the Bohr ground state is used as the asymptote, the perfect Mexican hat curve 
is distorted, producing an extreme for n between 5 and 6 where the depth of the well for H-states 
is about 0,01 cm-1 [8] as indicated in Fig. 1. These shifts in asymptotes (asymptotic freedom) and 
in the critical points are easily assessable since, with chiral symmetry breaking, the levels in the H-
Lyman En series are given by 
-En = Rharm/n2 –A(1-½π/n)2/n2 
(6) 
 
which also gives a chiral explanation for the observed Lamb shift [6]. With (6), the quantitative 
relation between critical n and an asymptote shift is obtained analytically [8]. 
The direct implication of the above for CERN-approach (1) is that the marks for mutually 
exclusive states H and H on the +n semi-axis have unjustly been reversed (a permutation), which 
is not allowed by virtue of the common sense examples above. CERN’s artificial H* is a state not 
allowed in nature, as, unlike natural H,  H* is not ordered on the field axis as it should. In short, 
trying to work out reaction (1) as in the highly praised CERN experiments [2] is as impossible as trying to make 
a gas by condensing or compressing a liquid. This is why, on the basis of the available line spectrum of 
natural species hydrogen, CERN-approach (1) [2] must be flawed immediately. With respect to 
spectral evidence and history, it appears that (1) is based upon an inadequate if not erratic 
interpretation of available spectra for both molecular and atomic hydrogen [4-8].  
 
QCD, quarks, antiparticles and antihydrogen. Nuclear stability 
Although some problems with H can be solved with the already available spectra [4-8] and 
without the complicated experiments [1,2], a new problem appears: the interpretation of natural 
intermediary bound and achiral state Hcrit, i.e. barrier (5), which prevents reaction (1) to be 
possible. It is evident that, if H has charge distribution +1, H has charge-inverted distribution –1, 
while both are still Coulomb systems. But this also means that bound state Hcrit must somehow

have zero charge distribution or that lepton and baryon or anti-lepton and anti-baryon are bound at close range 
but no longer exclusively by the Coulomb law. This moderate part of the stability (energy) of the 
complete system is exactly the part described by the errors of achiral Bohr theory [6,7]. This must 
not come as a surprise since, in all chiral structures observed in nature, the left-right difference 
does not have a drastic effect on its stability (energy). Only the left-right morphology of chiral structures is 
affected, be it in a mutually exclusive way. 
To understand this very same small fraction of the total H-energy beyond Bohr H-theory, QED 
was developed. This is essentially Dirac theory in the Coulomb field but the connection with 
chiral behavior of H was never made [6]. 
In bound state Hcrit, particle pair electron-proton as well as antiparticle pair positron-antiproton at 
short range do no longer interact exclusively by means Coulomb law, although they are known to 
interact strongly at long range, which is typical for quark behavior. A symmetric or achiral state in 
molecular hydrogen has the same effect on 4 lepton-baryon Coulomb interactions, which vanish 
from the scene exactly by virtue of a very specific structural symmetry [5]. An important 
byproduct of our analysis of atomic and of molecular hydrogen as well is the important effect of 
asymptotic freedom exactly as it is for QCD [5,8]. We conclude therefore that a quark model like QCD 
is needed to understand atomic and molecular hydrogen, the 2 simplest bound elementary particle 
systems, but readily assessable by spectroscopic methods [4,5]. 
A seemingly speculative but tempting solution for most of these problems with H is to explore 
the connection between quarks and antiparticles. Both are essential to understand bound states at 
short range but they cannot be isolated. At long-range, it proves impossible to detect or to isolate 
quarks or antiparticles as individual particles.  
Reconciling the fractional charge of quarks with the unit charge of antiparticles is easily done, as 
explained in [5]. Quite surprisingly, the solution for this charge problem has its roots, exactly like 
the Van der waals-curve, in the 19th century [4-8]. 
An additional common sense argument in favor of natural intra-atomic charge-inversions is, 
obviously, the stability of (higher Z-) nuclei. Adhering to the same concept as above for Z=1 as 
in scheme (3), it can be expected that, at long range, the conventional description holds for +Z> 
+1, with its repulsive Coulomb character of order +¼Z2/r. At short range, below some critical r, 
an antiparticle configuration will (gradually) appear. Then, in the intermediate achiral nuclear state 
corresponding with scheme (3) for H, reached when half of the protons turn into antiprotons, 
Coulomb repulsion transforms in Coulomb attraction of order -¼Z2/r. This may remove the 
conventional Coulomb repulsion at the nuclear level [4], which led, amongst others, to the quark 
model above. Next, a simple explanation is given for the apparent difference between even-Z and 
odd-Z nuclei. 
 
Physical difference between artificial H* and natural H 
We showed that the distinction between natural H and H-states may refer to reduced mass µ for 
system H, although absolute mass mH remains unchanged under the transition (3). So, natural 
mutually exclusive states H and H are separated by an internal algebra (parity) in reduced mass 
µ± = me(1±me/mH)  
(7) 
as in [6,12] but invisible in bound state QED [13]. The minus solution of (7) gives the reduced 
mass in Bohr- and QED H-theories. Artificial CERN version H* is connected with this same 
reduced mass by (1), but, in reality, inappropriate for antiH. This explains why H* and (1) are not 
allowed in nature and why (1) is impossible. The reduced mass for natural H is connected with 
the positive sign in (7) used in Bohr theory [6]. With (7), the ratio of reduced masses for natural 
H and H is of the order 1,0011. This is close to the observed anomalous mass of the free electron, 
i.e. 1,001159, a strange coincidence indeed [6,12]. 
Details of a 4-fermion chiral complex for perturbed hydrogen by radiation, as in (3), are in [14]. 
This brings (3) more in line with classical 19th century chiral behavior, as it should [14].

Conclusion 
A Van der waals-curve hidden in the line spectrum of atom hydrogen proves that scheme (3) is 
valid, that natural H-states exist [3-6] and that, with formation reaction (1) used by ATHENA 
and ATRAP collaborations [2], it is impossible to manufacture natural H. Understanding critical 
symmetrical or achiral bound state of atomic hydrogen, seemingly with zero charges and with 
relative energy (5), requires a QCD-like approach for 2 unit charge, neutral atomic hydrogen. In 
this context, the importance of an algebraic reduced mass (7) cannot be underestimated.  
As far as history is concerned, poor communication between physicists and chemists on the 
interpretation of available spectral data for N-unit charge systems like atomic and molecular 
hydrogen (the prototype chemical bond) is at the roots of unjust working hypothesis (1), the basis 
of [2]. Maybe, working out the connection between quarks and antiparticles, both needed to explain the chiral 
behavior of bound stable composite particles, can lead to a highly desirable common and more unifying solution.

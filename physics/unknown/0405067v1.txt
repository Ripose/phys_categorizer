I.  Introduction 

as voltage and 

     In the last decade, magnificent progress has been made in the theoretical and 
experimental investigati ons of molecular devices [1]. Molecular junctions have attracted 
considerable interest due to their small sizes, self -assembly features, mechanical flexibility, 
chemical tunability and unique transport properties. Until now, a lot of such structures have 
been proposed as a useful components of electronic circuits and realized in practice. The 
junction is usually made of two planar metallic electrodes joined by a molecular wire. The 
charge is transferred through the molecular bridge under the influence of bi
current-voltage (I -V) dependences are measured. Transport properties of the junction 
strongly depend on the quantum nature of molecular system, electronic structures of the 
electrodes near Fermi level and the molecule -to-electrodes coupling  [2]. Additionally, it is 
expected that the electron -electron interaction becomes important at the atomic scale and 
may produce essential effects in the transport characteristics [3]. In fact, negative differential 
resistance (NDR) has been reported [4] and  the suggested theoretical explanation is based on 
charging of the molecule [5].  
     The main purpose of this work is to study changes of the transport characteristics 
(conductance spectra and current
convenient framework for analyzing this problem in the self
-consistent manner is based on 
the generalized Breit -Wigner formula [6 -10]. In order to reproduce the experimental values 
of the current we must postulate that the molecular wire is weakly coupled t o the electrodes 
[11]. However, among all the factors that significantly affect the strength of the coupling we 
can enumerate: the geometry of the contacts, the type of molecule -to-electrodes binding and 
the molecule -electrode distance [8,12]. Since the ef
fective coupling is weak, molecule is 
modeled as a quantum dot with discrete energy levels, while both electrodes are treated as 
semi-infinite reservoirs of free electrons at thermal equilibrium (see Fig.1).

In this simplified picture, the current is due to sequential electron transfer, where the 
molecular wire is successively charge and discharged by the tunneling process. Although 
presented model does not allow us to c alculate electrostatic potential profile along the wire, 
it provides desired information concerning the charging effects. The charging of the 
molecule at large bias greatly influences the behavior of the conductance, as will be 
discussed later in this paper.  

II.  Description of the model  

 
     As mentioned above, the device is made of two electrodes joined by a molecular wire. If 
we restrict our considerations to weak-coupling limit, particular energy levels of the wire are 
well-separated (i.e. do not ov erlap with each others) and therefore the transmission can be 
written as a summation over all the states (for two spin directions):

     Different  types of nanowires are possible to provide, although the most popular are 
organic molecules [1], where conduction is due to  π-conjugated molecular orbitals. Such 
orbitals extend over the whole molecule and facilitate the transport of electrons between two 
reservoirs. In particular, linear carbon -atom chains containing up to 20 atoms  connected at 
the ends to metal atoms have been synthesized and recognized as an ideal one
-dimensional 
wires [16].  
     As an example, we have studied linear chain containing 12 carbon atoms weakly 
connected at the ends to the metal electrodes [17]. Since  only  π-electrons are involved into 
the conduction problem, initial electronic structure of the molecule is obtained through the 
use of H ü ckel Hamiltonian (with orthogonal atomic basis set of states) in the procedure of 
diagonalization (“bare” energy levels are given in eV: 
743
.4–
). In the strict H ü ckel approach, conducting energy level of the molecule 
produces a step-like contribution to the current. Therefore, the I -V function should look as a 
series of steps, occurring when the resonant conditions are satisfied for particular conducting 
orbitals. For further calculations, we assume realistically that Fermi level of 
unbiased 
) [18]. Temperature of 
electrodes is located in the middle of the HOMO -LUMO gap (
the system is set to 293 K, but anyway our results are not particularly sensitive to 
temperature.  
     Figure 2 presents transport characteris tics for 12 -atom wire, when the connection to the 
electrodes is the same at both ends. In the symmetric
-coupling case, there is no physical 
reason to appear any asymmetry in the spectra. Indeed, both curves (current
conductance-voltage) reveal  symmetric behavior independently from the strength of the 
electron-electron repulsion. Besides, the inclusion of charging results in modification of the 
steps in the  I -V dependence, which gain finite slope. Generally, the slope of the step 
decreases with  t he increase of  U -parameter and  I -V curve becomes fairly smooth. For 
extremely large U, the current steps are joint together into one continuous line and  I
characteristic does not display its jump -like character (see Fig.2a).  
     On the other hand, char ging enters the picture of conductance only at higher voltages, 
when an electrochemical potential tries to cross the conducting level, completely changing 
its behavior. The inclusion of electron -electron repulsion tends to broaden the sharp peaks of 
conductance, even if we have not included any extra level broadening into our computational

scheme (such as: thermal or additional coupling effects).  For larger U, peaks in conductance 
spectrum are shifted in th e direction of higher voltages and their height is lowered. In 
addition, these peaks gain substantial width and may even merge (see Fig.2b).   
     In Fig.3 we plot transport characteristics for 12 -atom wire, where the connection to the 
electrodes is differ ent at both ends. Our predictions indicate that there is no possibility to 
generate asymmetric transport dependence in the case of negligence of Coulomb interactions 
(although the molecule-to-electrodes coupling is asymmetric). Here we observe the effect o f 
U-induced current rectification, i.e. the magnitude of the current depends on the polarity of 
bias voltage. Moreover, asymmetry in the  I
parameter (see Fig.3a). Such diode -like characteristic has been observed in a 
experiments involving monolayer and multilayer films as well as a single molecule type 
junctions and STM measurements [19,20]. Within our model, the rectification effect is 
explained as a combined effect of asymmetry coupling to the reservoirs and electron-electron 
repulsion. U-induced asymmetry is also seen in the conductance spectra (see Fig.3b).

IV  Concluding remarks 
 
     In this paper, we have proposed a simple model to address the question of charging 
effects in biased molecular devices,  when the molecule is weakly coupled to the electrodes. 
Our model is based on the Breit
-Wigner type formula for the resonant conductance. The 
calculations predict significant changes in transport characteristics due to the inclusion of 
Coulomb interactions  in a self -consistent way. It is shown that the shape of current -voltage 
and conductance -voltage curves are determined by the combined effect of the electronic 
structure of the molecule and by electron -electron repulsion. In particular, the rectification 
effect stems from simultaneous considerations of asymmetry coupling to the reservoirs and 
Coulomb interactions. It should be also noted that final conclusions are in agreement with 
some recent investigations [21].  
     In closing, it is important to stress  some limitations of our model. Presented model fails 
when the width of the molecular orbitals is comparable with energy difference between 
them, so that the resonances may overlap (the strong -coupling limit). Furthermore, transport 
is analyzed as a cohere
intramolecular vibrations. However, for organic molecules that condition could not be 

nt tunneling, where the transit time is much less than the

into account. Anyway, dephasing effects are far beyond the scope of the present work.

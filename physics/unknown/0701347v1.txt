  This gravitational potential, tries to explain the anomalous shift of the perihelion of 
Mercury. Otherwise, applied as a potential of force added to a mechanical momentum, 
could give a partial explanation of the anomalous acceleration of  Pioneer 10/11. Anyway, it 
is an hypothetical conjecture without any proof of its physical reality. 

 
 
  

1. - Gravitational Geometry.  Mercury   
   
In a flat space-time based on  new post–Newtonian physics, any  gravitational 

    
potential candidate to  solve the anomalous precession of Mercury, must be related with  a 
finite propagation speed and also with the relative radial velocity of the attracted object.   

 
    
Laplace  proposed in 1805 a gravitational force maintaining the inverse square of 
the distance law, adding a complementary term related with both speeds. This complemen-
tary force, was in the same direction that the vector-speed of the target. Also Riemann 
(1886) worked with a  velocity–dependent gravitational force  with the following expression:

In the hypothetical existence  of a  gravitational potential in the real universe 

 
      
of material objects, it seems reasonable to think that it could depend on the ratio between 
propagation speed (c) and that of the target. The gradient of a potential that moves forward 
with certain speed, will take a time to reach the target and also a very reduced time  to cross 
it and produce a “transit action” in its mass. During that  time, the attracted object, perceives 
the real existence of this potential and  reacts by means of  changing  position, speed and 
trajectory. The impulse trasmitted by  the potential to the target, becomes a balanced action 
to adapt itself to the force coming from the outside world. 
 
  
potential and the attracted body, if existing, it should be an electrodynamic one. If a 
potential and a target -with a speed (Vr)-, are moving with the same direction, the transit 
time between them will be larger  if both have the  same forward way, and  will decrease if 
they are moving in the opposite one; the hypothetical iteration (“transit action”) cannot be 
the same in each situation. The larger or reduced transit time between target and potential, is  

Although it is considered unknown the nature of the iteration between the

Be t1 the transit time a potential  uses  to cross through an object. If the target

movement. 
 
  
moves in the same forward direction as the potential, the new time t2 will be larger than t1 
and will have the following ratio:    t2 · c = t2· Vr + t1· c        
 
 
 
 
 
  
ratio  as being electrodynamic Weber type force. Also, we must consider that energy 
potentials  are always proportional to the square of the time. Therefore, a different 
behaviour from the target would be expected, if it moves forward or against the potential. 
However, this complementary “transit action” to the classic gravitational potential, would 
not be very significant since it is in proportion to [c / (c ±Vr) ]2 that is in order of 10-9 in  
Mercury´s orbit. The radial speed of a planet is directly related with the eccentricity of its 
orbit and in Mercury the effect  could be appreciate in spite of its reduced magnitude; if this 
new acceleration exist, it would perturb the orbit producing the advance of its perihelion. 
The modified gravitational attraction would have a potential with the following expression:    

The resultant new force,  will be however proportional to the square of this

If we accept this interference and  general formulation, it implies to consider 
that  gravitation has a finite propagation speed and  action at distance, should be a quantum 
electrodynamic  iteration within the target body. It is necessary not to forget that although 
this statement could be theoretically admitted, we don't have any real or experimental 
confirmation of it.  
 
     
although it was based on a very different physical interpretation. We can obtain the value of 
the associated potential force, applying Lagrangian equations; however they give an 
appropriate mathematical result, its physical meaning admits alternatives. The numeric 
value of the apparent force is: 

A mathematical potential similar to U(r , Vr),  was studied by Gerber (1898)

The mathematical value of this  force (for unit-mass of the object), produces an 

   
   
equation of motion that lightly perturbs the keplerian orbit inducing a precession with the 
same value as observed in Mercury`s orbit: ≈ 43” of arc per century. It is the same value 
obtained by General Relativity, although it is necessary to underline that however is the 
same precession, it is not the same general equation of motion. The precession for each orbit 
produced by the potential    U(r , Vr),  is:

upon the radial speed of an object, would produce an identical precession to the one 
observed for the planet Mercury and to any target with an elliptic trajectory. This is only 
true if the hypothetical propagation speed  of the gravitational potential, is the same as the 
speed of light.

the own newtonian acceleration, should produce a mechanical impulse due to the relative 
increase/decrease of the differential  transit time inside the object. This mechanical 
momentum doesn't produce any added real force, ( it could have an apparent mathematical 
value), and is transmitted to the object modifying the angle of its speed with the tangent to 
the orbit. The mechanical impulse produces a differential turn on the trajectory and its 
consecutive amount along a complete orbit, reaches the observed final precession. It is 
necessary to underline that the differential kinematic precession -dd - produced by the 
mechanical impulse -Lm- associated with the potential Up(2S), is twice as much  the 
precession -dβ- produced by the force Fd, a real dynamic force associated with the potential 
Up(S2). Another way of testing this relation between -dd - and -dβ-  is to  analyse the  
kinematic and dynamic balance in any point of the orbit:

it is an angular deformation of the trajectory because the planet reacts to the perturbation

Therefore, the transit action produces a real force -Fd- and a mechanical momentum

observed for Mercury and also agrees with General Relativity elliptic orbits precession.  

 
Along the descending branch of the ellipse, Mercury comes closer to the Sun with a 

   
radial speed opposite to the gravitational potential, therefore the  final acceleration,  will be 
something less compared with the classic gravitational one. The perturbing acceleration is 
directed outside the orbit, so the Planet will move outward  in relation with  the position it 
should occupy in the keplerian ellipse; this movement only takes place if the orbit rotates a 
forward  angle (dd + dβ). In both cases the precession takes place in the forward direction 
because in both branches of the ellipse, the balance point is located in an upstream position. 
Another form of understanding what happens is that in both branches, the keplerian ellipse is

   2.-  Pioneer 10/11 Anomalous Acceleration. 

If it is really this way, the advance of the perihelion of Mercury 
would be the result of the hypothetical existence of a gravitational potential in the real 
universe of  material objects; the energy transmitted to the target, is proportional to the 
square of the transit time. This value is obtained if propagation speed, is the same as speed 
of  light, statement which is not clearly proven in spite of the results quoted by Kopeikin 
(2002). The  aberration due to a gravitational potential of finite speed, is not significant in 
the solar system where the global barycentre stays inside the Sun. However, aberration 
happens in a  double star system but also in that case, a balanced rotation is obtained 
although the gravitational acceleration is larger than the one that would fit with the classic 
law.   
  
                  
 
  
planets of the Solar System in particular Jupiter and Saturn. They travel with a  nearly 
uniform speed of ≈12 Km/seg. Anderson et al, detected in 1998 a constant anomalous 
acceleration in both spacecrafts of 8,74 (± 1,33)·10-10 m/s2 directed toward the Sun, between 
20 and 60 AU.  
 
  
previously defined, an anomalous acceleration  directed toward the Sun would take place  
since the Pioneer10/11  travels with a  considerable speed moving away from it. Therefore 
we will have a larger  transit time between the gravitational potential and the spacecraft 
compared with a perfect circular orbit or a rest position.

directed toward the Sun as the Pioneer 10/11 have. For a distance of 10 AU, the anomalous 
acceleration should have reached values in  order of  50,5·10-10  m/s2 although it has not 
probably been separated from the own classic gravitation because  the  flyby of Jupiter and 
Saturn located 5 and 10 AU. At a distance of 50 AU, the anomalous acceleration  would 
reach 2,1·10-10  m/s2  although the speed should be  fallen lightly. It is possible that this 
mechanical impulse, also affects  the communication signal between  spacecrafts and Earth, 
inducing  the Doppler with an apparent acceleration of the Pioneer directed toward the Earth 
that would be added to the real previous one that is directed toward the Sun.  
 
  
Although the potential U(r ,S) could explain at least partially the anomalous 
acceleration of aircrafts  Pioneer 10/11,  the most appropriate  would be to carry out a new 
launching of another space ship. This mission is designed to determine the origin of the 
discovered anomaly, project that has been supported by the international scientific 
community.

obtained by the classic newtonian mechanics. A perturbed gravitational potential similar to 
U(r ,S), should produce the relativistic deviation of  light as the real force Fd applied  is :

The coefficients of each term of the unitary force Fd, must have these exact values, 

    
just to produce the correct deflection of light and to be also a conservative energy system.

compatible both events if: 
 

However, the transit action  of a potential U(r ,S), should produce a real Tisserand 

a)   Fd  has indeed the correct coefficients linked with the deviation of light. 
b)   The kinematic effect produced by Lm must  not yield any deviation of the angle 
neither any perturbation to light photons besides a red or blue-shift detected by 
Doppler, or perhaps the light signal time-delay. 

 
Anyway, this hypothetical conjecture is in front of a clear objection because as light 

is considered a target, -Vr- speed has the same magnitude as -c-, so there are not valid the 
approaches applied to objects with a “normal” speed as we have done with U(r ,S).

As it was developed in 1993, if the gravitational potential is a suitable 

field in the physical-material universe, it cannot cover at the same time the whole entire  
space that occupies. Certainly its appearance of continuity and uniform density is 
extraordinary high due to the also extraordinary  masses of the stars and source planets. 
Anyway, if its constitution is not absolutely continuous neither infinite, gravitation could be 
analyse by statistical procedures.    
   
  
If we study the production of a gravitational potential from a focus, the law of 
the inverse square  distance, could be obtained as the medium value of an aleatory force that 
verifies, a) the probability of the gravitational potential inside the stereoscopic angle of the 
target, b) an straight line trajectory inside the object and, c) the probability of concurrence 
of that specific trajectory in relation to the total mass of the attracted body.    
    
   
any real or experimental confirmation of it), the universal gravitation constant (G) , would 
be in connection with the unitary production of momentum by two electrodynamic fields in 
contact (“transit action ").

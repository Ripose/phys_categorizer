Scientific inquiry in modern art 

Mikhail Simkin 

“He  suggested  I  play  golf,  but  finally  agreed  to  give  me  something  that,  he  said,  "would  really  work";  and 
going to a cabinet, he produced a vial of violet-blue capsules banded with dark purple at one end, which, he 
said, had just been placed on the market and were intended not for neurotics whom a draft of water could calm 
if properly administered, but only for great sleepless artists who had to die for a few hours in order to live for 
centuries.”       

-- Vladimir Nabokov, Lolita  

Are the sleepless artists really great, or merely properly administered?  

To check this I wrote the “True art or a fake?” quiz [1]. It consists of a dozen of pictures. Some of them are 
True  Masterpieces  of  Abstract  Art,  created  by  Immortal  Artists.    The  rest  are  ridiculous  fakes,  produced  by 
myself. The takers are to tell which is which.  

Apart  from  the  scores,  which  are  automatically  recorded,  occasionally  I  get  feedback.  This  note  had  arrived 
from a Cornell University professor: “I recognized that No. 2 was like a Mondrian, but it seemed to lack the 
sense of balance which good modern art is supposed to have”. Apparently, Mondrian’s art looses balance when 
his heavy-weight name is detached from it. Even art critics are not sure that they can tell true art from fake: “I 
got 92%, which is a relief since I write about art.” It is thus not surprising that sometimes the quiz provokes 
angry reaction. One New York artist responded with the following utterance: “Go [profanity] yourself and your 
[profanity]  academic  quizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.”  As  if  in  response  to  this  attempt  of  intimidation,  one  of  my 
readers wrote: "Dear Mr. Simkin, just continue with this". And I did.  

The distribution of the scores received by over fifty thousands quiz-takers1 is shown in Figure 1.The average 
score is 7.91 out of 12 or 65.9% correct. 

Our respondents did poorly on the test. But could this be because they are a bunch of philistines, interested in 
only material side of life and vulgar in taste? I don’t know them personally, as the testing was done over the 
internet.  However,  the  quizzing  software  [2]  records  taker’s  IP  address.  From  it  one  can  infer  where  their 
computer was located. This enabled me to select the test scores received by people who downloaded the quiz 
from  elite  locations.  For  the  analysis  I  chose  Ivy  League  schools  and  Oxbridge  (if  not  for  any  other  reason, 
than because I did time in those places). The average elite score is 8.5 out of 12 or 71% correct. Figure 2 shows 
the distribution of the scores received by 143 chosen quiz-takers, and Table 1 shows their distribution by elite 
schools. When comparing the averages and the distributions of scores, shown in Figures 1 and 2, we see that 
there is not much difference between the elite and the crowd. 

Although the performance of our quiz-takers is poor, it is better than what one can do by random guessing. The 
latter would produce a symmetric distribution of scores centered at six correct answers, and the average score 
of  50%.  Does  this  mean  that  there  is  a  small,  but  perceptible  difference  in  quality  between  abstract 
masterpieces and fakes? Probably not. From the  feedback  I know that many  quiz takers had previously seen 
                                                 
1 There were 71,456 test results in the database. However a number of people took several shots at the quiz.  I cleaned the data from 
the second-attempt scores by selecting only the first score from each IP address. This reduced the number of test scores to 61,121. 
Next I cleaned the data from the results, where one or more questions were skipped. This reduced the number of the test scores to 
56,020. 

some or all of the masterpieces, identified as such. For example, one of the respondents wrote: “I gave this test 
to  my  oldest  son  who  is  teaching  sculpture  at  The  Finnish  Art  Academy.  Much  to  my  chagrin,  he  could  not 
only separate the art from the chaff, but also name all the artists.”  Another successful strategy, used by many 
high-scores, is well summarized in this note: “I got 100% in your quiz. Why? Because I could tell immediately 
which were created on a computer and which were created on canvas”.    

Apart  from  explicit  mentions  in  feedback,  the  fact  that  many  quiz  takers  had  previously  seen  some  of  the 
masterpieces can be directly inferred from the distribution of test scores. The average score of 65.9% means 
that an average image was identified correctly as true art or fake in 65.9% of the cases.  An interesting thing is 
that this splits unevenly  between masterpieces  and fakes. An average masterpiece was correctly identified as 
such in pm = 67.5% of the cases, while average fake was correctly identified as such in only pf   = 64.3%. The 
standard  errors  of  both  pm  and  pf  are  0.1%,  so  the  difference  pm -  pf = =  3.2%  is  statistically  significant.  The 
obvious  explanation  of  this  observation  is  that  some  of  the  quiz-takers  had  previously  seen  some  of  the 
masterpieces. If someone had seen the image in an art gallery or in an album he will tick it as true art.  If he 
didn’t see it before, he will have to use other criteria, for example, whether image was created on a computer or 
on canvas. As our quiz-takers haven’t previously seen any of the fakes, the percentage of correct identification 
of a  fake should be equal to the percentage of the correct identification of a masterpiece in the case that the 
quiz-taker hasn’t seen it before. This can be used to estimate the fraction, f, of the masterpieces, used in the 
quiz, that were previously seen by the quiz-takers.  The probability, pm , to identify a masterpiece correctly can 
be  splits  in  two  terms.  If  the  taker  has  seen  the  masterpiece  before  (what  happens  with  probability  f),  he 
identifies  it  correctly  with  probability  1.  If  he  hasn’t  seen  the  masterpiece  before  (what  happens  with 
probability 1-f), he identifies it correctly with probability pf. Thus: pm = f + (1 - f) pf.  From this follows:  f = 
(pm - pf) / (1 - pf) = 9%. 

Although  the  quiz  results  are  biased  in  favor  of  masterpieces,  I’ll  take  them  on  face  value  to  quantify  the 
difference  in  quality  between  the  images.  Table  2  shows  for  every  picture  the  fraction  of  quiz-takers  that 
selected it as “true art”. The top-rated painting was ticked “true” by 80% of people, and the bottom-rated by 
only 15%. What does this say about the difference in intrinsic quality? 

A hundred years ago psychologist F.M. Urban conducted the classic study of just perceptible differences [3]. 
He  asked  the  subjects  of  his  experiment  to  compare  a  hundred-gram  weight  with  a  set  of  different  weights. 
When two weights were very close the subject’s judgment was poor. However, statistically, the lighter weight 
was perceived to be heavier in less than fifty percent of the cases.   For example, 92, 100, and 104 gram were 
perceived heavier than 100 gram, in 10%, 50%, and 84% of trials correspondingly. I defined the “weight” of a 
hypothetical  painting,  which  is  selected  as  true  art  by  50%  of  quiz  takers  as  100  gram.  Afterwards,  by 
interpolation of Urban’s data, I inferred the “weights” of the paintings, used in the quiz (see Figure 3). They 
are given in the rightmost column of Table 2. 
 
The  difference  in  weight  between  the  lightest  (93.8  g)  and  the  heaviest  (103.4  g)  pictures  is  ten  percent.  For 
comparison,  in  the  sport  of  weight  lifting  men  weighting  between  94  and  105  kg  belong  to  the  same  weight 
category [4]. I conclude that all pictures in the quiz, when judged by their intrinsic qualities, fall into the same 
weight category. The only difference between masterpieces and fakes is in heavy-weight names attached to the 
masterpieces.

Figure 3. Small rhombs represent Urban’s data on the fraction of “heavier” judgments for different weights (with 
the  control  weight  of  100  gram).    The  line  is  the  interpolation  of  that  data.    The  larger  symbols  represent  the 
pictures used in the quiz. Picture’s “weight” was adjusted so that the symbols fall on the interpolation line. You 
can have a look at the pictures themselves on the quiz’s webpage [1].

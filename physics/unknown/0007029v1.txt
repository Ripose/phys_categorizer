Abstract
The PEP-II B Factory Low-Level RF System (LLRF) is a
fully programmable VXI based design running under an
EPICS control environment. Several RF feedback loops
are used to control
longitudinal coupled-bunch modes
driven by the accelerating mode of the RF cavities. This
paper updates the performance of the LLRF system as
beam currents reach design levels. Modiﬁcations which
enhance the stability, diagnostics, and overall operational
performance are described. Recent data from high current
operation is included.

1.  INTRODUCTION

Both the high energy ring (HER) and the low energy ring
(LER) of the PEP-II B factory are inherently longitudi-
nally unstable due to interaction between the beam and the
fundamental mode of the RF cavities [1]. RF feedback
loops operating at baseband and a ﬁber optic connection to
the longitudinal multibunch feedback system were used
successfully to control the low-order longitudinal modes
(ﬁgure 3) [2,3,4]. The system is modular and very com-
pact. The LLRF hardware for each RF station is based on a
set of custom, highly integrated VXI modules (ﬁgure 1).
Each station contains a built-in network analyzer to con-
ﬁgure and test the feedback loops and a series of transient
signal recorders which can record a wide variety of wave-
forms. After a fault has occurred the circular buffers are
frozen and the data is stored in ﬁles. This post-mortem
analysis capability has proven to be extremely beneﬁcial
for diagnosing problems, especially intermittent faults.

Overall the system has preformed extremely well. To
date stored current has reached 950 mA in the HER and
1700 mA in the LER. Even at the highest currents the
beams are well stabilized by the active controls. Presently
the HER beam current is limited to the 700 mA due to
heating of one vacuum chamber. Beam current and phase
of both rings while colliding are shown (ﬁgure 2).

The use of RF feedbacks does complicate some
aspects of system operation. The changes we have made
and plan to make to improve operation will be described in
detail so others may beneﬁt from our experience.
2.  DECREASING STATION CYCLE TIME
Once beam currents exceed ~300 mA, a beam abort will
cause all the RF stations to trip on cavity reﬂected power.
This is due to the cavities tuners being set to match the
large reactive beam contribution, which is suddenly
removed. In addition, the wideband direct RF feedback
loop attempts to maintain the gap voltage (ﬁgure 3), keep-
ing output power high while cavities are reﬂecting >90kW
of RF power. Since the tuners cannot move quickly we
chose to improve the overall station power-up cycle time.
The power-up procedure is implemented as an EPICS
state sequence, thus is fully programmable [5]. The origi-
nal approach (slow turn-on) energized the station at a
moderate gap voltage with RF feedback loops disabled.
The gain of the direct and then the comb loop were
ramped up, followed by raising the gap voltage to the
desired level. This procedure required three minutes to
complete. The new fast turn-on scheme presets the tuner
positions, loop gains, and baseband IQ references to their
no-beam, normal gap voltage values. The klystron high
voltage corresponding to the no-beam condition is then

3.  EXCESSIVE BASEBAND VOLTAGES

When direct RF feedback is employed, the drive power is
proportional to the direct loop error voltage. In an IQ base-
band RF system like PEP-II, the error signals are voltages
representing the real and imaginary components of what
eventually will become the klystron RF drive. During
operational conditions when the error signals become
large, excessive baseband voltages may present a problem.

Fig. 4.  PEP-II LLRF baseband drive analog processing.

The analog signal chain for the PEP-II LLRF system is
depicted in ﬁgure 4. The baseband modulator is composed
of four wideband analog multipliers followed by a pair of
high speed op-amps [4]. This particular modulator is used
to compensate for klystron gain and phase variations due
to changes in the cathode voltage as power requirements
vary (PEP-II klystrons do not contain modulation anodes).
The multipliers are Gilbert-cell based devices rated at 1
volt maximum input. An idiosyncrasy of this class of mul-
tipliers is that when over-driven the output polarity may
actually invert. This would result in an incorrect phase
shift across the modulator and may cause positive feed-
back around the direct RF feedback loop. This effect com-

plicated our initial attempts for fast turn-on.

To prevent overdriving the multipliers, back-to-back
Schottky diodes were installed across the feedback resistor
in the gain stage preceding the baseband modulator. A
series resistor was added to form a “soft” limiter at the
desired 1 volt threshold (ﬁgure 5). The addition of the lim-
iting circuit greatly improved the performance of the fast
turn-on approach and is presently in use. There is, how-
ever, a further complication...

4. SECONDARY EFFECT OF KLYSTRON

GAIN TRACKING

As klystron cathode voltage is elevated to increase output
power, the gain of the tube increases. This effect is most
dramatic in the LER since each klystron drives two rather
then four cavities. The required klystron power ranges
from 250 kW (no beam) up to the rated 1.2 MW output, an
increase of 7dB. Since the klystron is in the direct RF
feedback loop, the gain of the baseband modulator must be
decreased to compensate for the additional klystron gain.
Decreasing the modulator gain forces an increase in the
multiplier input voltages in order to keep drive power con-
stant. This implies that enough dynamic range must be
available to allow the multiplier input voltages to double
and still remain less than 1 volt.

Conﬁguring the drive chain (ﬁgure 6) such that at the
maximum modulator gain (corresponding to the no-beam
klystron power) the IQ voltages are half scale is achieved
by picking the proper transimpedance gain and ﬁxed atten-
uators. During conditions when the IQ voltages are satu-
rated (during fast turn-on for example), the drive power
could exceed four times the desired value. We avoid this
during fast turn-on by presetting the baseband modulator

5.  PREVENTING EXCESSIVE DRIVE
POWER FOR ROBUST OPERATION

During normal operation we have experienced occasional,
as yet unexplained, sudden loss of the cavity probe RF sig-
nal. The built-in transient recorders have proven very use-
ful to study these phenomenon. The fault signature is not
consistent with a full cavity arc since the reﬂected power
does not show a large perturbation. In systems operating
with direct RF feedback the loss of a cavity probe signal
will cause the drive chain to immediately saturate. If the
klystron is severely over-driving, the output power will
actually drop (ﬁgure 7). If the drive power exceeds the
peak of the saturation curve, even for a brief instant, the
direct feedback loop will saturate and not recover.

existing linear detector in the IQA module [6]. If the
detected voltage exceeds a programmable set-point, both
the baseband drive signals will be reduced proportionally
to decrease the drive power to a programmable level while
maintaining the output phase. We expect this feature will
allow each RF system to “ride through” transient events
which presently cause a fault.

Fig. 7.  Measured klystron saturation curve showing sug-
gested operating points (Wop) at various cathode voltages.

In an attempt to prevent klystron overdrive we conﬁg-
ured the transimpedance ampliﬁer gain such that the RF
modulator was operating near saturation when producing
saturated klystron drive power from one baseband input (I
or Q). This implies that the maximum power could be 3dB
higher if both inputs were driven to saturation.

In practice the task of balancing maximum available
drive power with required dynamic range of the baseband
modulator is a trade off. Operating any of the components
near saturation degrades the system’s ability to amplitude
modulate. The ability of the LLRF system to fully cancel
the RF ripple caused by the switching aspect of the high
voltage power supply (HVPS) is compromised. Based on
our experience we propose upgrading the system.

6.  PROPOSED CHANGES

By applying active limiters before the baseband modulator
we can prevent overdriving the multipliers while preserv-
ing linearity during normal operation (ﬁgure 8). Suitable
op-amps must be selected which can tolerate the +/-1 volt
differential voltages present during non-limiting condition.
A second limiting circuit will be added to prevent the
drive power from exceeding the klystron’s saturation point
(ﬁgure 9). The actual drive power will be detected by an

The ﬁnal change we plan to make to the system is the
addition of a wideband analog “ripple” loop to cancel RF
modulation caused by the switching aspect of the HVPS.
A DSP was intended to handle this task but the combina-
tion of signiﬁcant delay in the digital IQ receiver and the
50 kHz bandwidth ripple proved challenging. Presently an
analog integrator in the direct RF feedback loop cancels
the ripple but simulations show it will cause instability as
beam currents reach 2A.

7.  CONCLUSIONS

The PEP-II RF system has performed extremely well.
Large beam currents are routinely stored with no sign of
instabilities. The EPICS interface provides a ﬂexible tool
to improve many operational aspects of the system in short
order. We hope our experience with baseband RF feed-
backs will provide others with useful information.

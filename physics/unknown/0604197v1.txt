Introduction

In the initial simulation of ALCPG muon tracking, the projection of a muon, or other 
charged particle, through the detector assumes a helical path without corrections for 
energy loss. Since the generation of Monte Carlo events using GEANT properly takes 
into account multiple scattering, energy loss, etc. there are systematic differences in 
comparisons of the projected track with the generated track, especially for low 
momentum muons.  The helical swimmer used so far in simulation studies is an excellent 
tool for a tracker in which the material density is low. However, while following charged 
particles through the calorimeters, the coil and the muon detector the loss of energy in the 
material must be taken into account.  The long lever arm of the Muon Detector stresses 
the necessity of a program which accounts for the loss of energy of the particle in the 
material. The stepper answers that need and is discussed in this note. We first present an 
outline of the algorithm of the stepper that is then tested on the Muon Analysis code. The 
inclusion into the Muon code and the improvement for track matching in the hadron 
calorimeter and muon detector are shown.  

Algorithm Outline

The stepper is performing a chosen number of steps through the material located in the 
way of the particles, e.g. in the calorimeters layers, and the loss by dE/dx as well as the 
change in direction due to the magnetic field are reflected upon the momentum change, 
each step,  and the position and momentum recalculated anew for the next step. 
The motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field Bz with energy loss in the 
medium can be expressed by a change in direction of the momentum in the (px, py) plane 
due to the magnetic field, followed by a change in magnitude of momenta (px, py, pz) due 
to the loss in energy in the material.  
One starts with a particle at the interaction point (IP), at a given position x, y, z ~ 0, 0, 0 
with a given momentum px, py, pz and mass. The motion through matter in a magnetic 
field is given by:

The 2nd term in px and py is the usual qv B term due to the field Bz, and the 3rd term 
comes from energy loss. Because the field is in the z direction, pz changes only due to the 
energy loss in the media. Here px(n), py(n), pz(n) are in GeV/c, E(n) in GeV and 
clight=3E08 m/s, is the velocity of light, 
seconds.   

t(n) the time duration between steps is in 

Due to its motion the particle loses energy in the material and therefore slows down 
accordingly, with a change in the kinetic energy .In step n, for a path length  s, assuming

The momentum decreases due to loss to matter, and therefore the  x,  y,  z are negative 
quantities.

  One notices that the change in momentum is completely symmetrical between the 
   

components px and py. The bigger the component the bigger the loss in that direction, as 
is expected. 
There is also a component pz to which only the passage through matter contributes, which 
has the same form.  

Path

The position x(n+1), y(n+1), z(n+1) is recalculated after each step as a function of the 
new values of px, py, pz ,E and the old position x(n), y(n), z(n) as follow:

t(n) is the time of flight in seconds of the particle at step n and is calculated below 

and 
as a function of pi(n), i = x, y, z, E(n), and x(n),y(n),z(n). 
The position at step (n+1) is given in cm, therefore we express clight =3E10 cm/s. The 
momentum components are given in GeV/c, and the energy in GeV as before  

Is calculated by looking at the radii r(n+1) and r(n) in the (x, y) plane, r(n) being the 
radius of the layer crossed by the particle in step n  and the Vi(n) is given by

  The Package Used

The original Muon package used was generated at NIU by R. Markeloff [1] .C. Milstene 
extended it to include the EMCal barrel. This package contains the java code below 
which should be compiled in the order they are here.    

SegmentFinder.java  

    BarrelCalSegmentFinder.java  
    MuonCalSegmentFinder.java 
    which contains an inner class: 
    TrackExtrapolator.java 
    MuonCandidate.java       
    MuonList.java 
   MuonReco.java 
The classes produced should be located in a folder named 
hep\lcd\recon\muon\ 
The above folder has to be included in another folder containing the driver: 
LCDMuonDriver.java  

Code Modification to Include the Stepper

The Track Stepper class follows exactly the algorithm presented in the outlines. 
The following sub-directory has to be created, and it must contain the stepper class:  

Hep\lcd\util\step\   

And one needs to add an import statement in both classes 
BarrelCalSegmentFinder.java and 
MuonCalSegmentFinder.java methods  

import hep.lcd.util.step  

In the MuonCalSegmentFinder.java, the actual steps through the material replace the 
track extrapolation; therefore, in MuonCalSegmentFinder.java only about one-third of  
The original code is left, the following class has disappeared:.  

private class TrackExtrapolator for the BarrelCalSegmentFinder instance field, 
where the object swmr was defined one also defines the object stpr, as shown below:  

protected HelicalSwimmer swmr = new HelicalSwimmer( ); 
protected TrackStepper stpr   = new TrackStepper( ); //C.M.-

   Whenever a call to the helical swimmer was used in BarrelCalSegmentFinder.java   or 

MuonCalSegmentFinder.java, namely.  

(params, r, zmax); 

;  

swmr.
rint = swmr.
is replaced by 
    
stpr.
rstep  = stpr.

(r, zmax, stepConditions); and 

;    

Where rstep in the stepper replaces rint in the swimmer and represents the coordinates of 
the last point reached by the particle.  

In the case of the stepper one requires that each segment of material encountered is 
stepped with the correct loss of energy by dE/dx in the material and the correct magnetic 
field. This includes the layers of air in between the calorimeters as well as the 9.2 cm of 
carbon left in between the EMCAL and the HCAL for the SiD  LC detector. In the 
calorimeter, when the charged particle reaches the center of the last layer an extra step of 
half a layer, absent for the swimmer, is required for the stepper.  

On the other hand, to go through the tracker up to the entrance of EMCAL the swimmer 
of Ray Frey ( Javaized  by Tony Johnson) and the stepper give the same results. The last 
point reached has the exact same coordinates such that the swimmer and the stepper 
could be interchanged when there is very little/or no material, as in the tracker.   

Improvements in HCAL and MUDET 

For particles above ~20 GeV/c the swimmer properly represents the hits, but at lower 
energy the effect of the energy loss on the particle trajectory is important. The mean 
energy lost by dE/dx by the particle from the Interaction Point (IP) to the MUDET is 
~1.2GeV/c. 
Below is shown the overlay of the hits and the extrapolated tracks layer by layer as a 
function of the layer number for the same 3 GeV/c Muon, with the swimmer and also 
with the Stepper, which includes dE/dx. One notices that in the last layers at the end of 
HCAL there is no overlap of hits with the swimmer whereas there is excellent overlap 
with the stepper. 
At higher energy the muon detection efficiency is somewhat higher with the stepper than 
with the swimmer, but the discrepancies between swimmer and stepper are less 
important. The higher the energy the closer are the results with both methods, e.g. the 
agreement is better at 20 GeV/c than at 10 GeV/c. Therefore we have extensively tested 
the region between 3GeV and 5 GeV . 
The agreement is also worse farther away from the interaction point. Therefore at low 
momenta the results are better with HCAL than with MUDET. 
Below is represented the track extrapolation in HCAL using the swimmer versus the hits. 
One can see that around the middle of the track the two curves are separate from each 

6

 
  
  
  
  other. The next plot shows the track extrapolation using the stepper with the loss of 

energy by dE/dx included versus the hits. Here one sees that both the track extrapolation 
and the hits are undistinguishable.

  In Figure 4 is represented the overlay of hits and tracks in the MUDET layer by layer as a 

function of the layer number with the swimmer. Once can see the discrepancy is bigger 
than in HCAL.

Bin = f (Layer Number) - 300 Bins 32 Layers. 

Then after using the stepper and a magnetic field which drops from 5 Tesla to  0.6 Tesla 
at the entrance of the coil and up to a radius of 550cm one gets the overlay hits track 
layer by layer as a function of the layer which, even at 3GeV/c, shows a very good match 
in MUDET , shown in the next figure, same event as in the previous figure.

Below is represented in Figure 6, the distribution of the difference in Phi between tracks

The

(Track-Hit) is relatively well centered on the zero. These distributions are done at

Figure 10- The Stepper (x, y) Distribution For Single Muon Tracks at 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50 GeV  

The 3 GeV muon is curling in the magnetic field Bz =5 Tesla in the tracker. The EMCAL 
boundaries are shown by two red circles; HDCAL is between the two black circles. Note 
the particle trajectory straightens in the coil, indicated by the two green circles, where the 
field drops and even changes sign. The trajectory is almost straight; in fact it is very 
slightly inverted in MUDET shown by the two blue circles. The 3 GeV/c particles do not 
get all the way through the MUDET, they stop somewhere around layer 16 in MUDET. 
The 4 GeV and 5GeV Muons have a very similar behavior but have enough energy to 
make it all the way through the MUDET. 
 Above 5 GeV, the higher the particle momentum, the smaller the curling in the magnetic  
field as it appears above for the particles at 10, 20 and 50 GeV. The 50GeV muon looks 
even straight.   

Following in Figures 10,11 are the (x, y) representations using the Single Event Display 
of the 3, 10 GeV Muons represented by the stepper in Figure 9.  One can see the 

11

 
  
 
  trajectories produced by the stepper are a faithful representation of the events as seen by 

the event display.

The evolution Through the Detector of the point (px/pInt, py/pIint) ratio of the momentum 
components to it norm at Interaction Point (pInt) are shown for Single Muons of different 
energies using the stepper. 
WARNING: The following plots are very different in behavior than the (x, y) track 
projections. They are complementary. One starts with the maximum momentum, e.g. 3 
GeV/c, to which we normalize the 2 components of the momentum px and py in different 
elements of the Detector. 

12

 
  
  In the tracker px and py changes come only due to the magnetic field Bz but  

(px  px + py 

x ) being bigger) and goes on loosing energy in 

 py) ~ pInt stays constant, the material in the Tracker being negligible. 
 The point  (px/pInt, py/pInt) is on the circle of radius 1, the norm of the momentum  
Being almost unchanged. Then, in the calorimeters, the particle loses energy, and 
therefore momentum in the material encountered. The new points (px/pInt, py/pInt) is 
moving toward the center to a radius smaller than one. It loses even more energy in 
HCAL than in ECAL (the  ((dE/dx)
the COIL and in the MUDET, but there, the magnetic field is inverted and smaller in 
magnitude. Therefore the momentum starts high and ends up at or close to zero at 3 
GeV/c, and the particles often stops in the MUDET, in about 20 layers or less .The point 
(px/pInt, py/pInt) ends up at the center of the circle.  
The position (x, y), on the other hand, was starting at the Interaction Point at a radius  
r = (x x + y y)~0 and increases to end up at a radius ~362 cm in the MUDET for a 3 
GeV Muon. The 4 GeV/c muon is left with ~10% of its momentum at the border of the 
instrumented Muon Detector, and the higher the Muon Momentum the smaller the 
change in radius (the smaller the proportion of momentum loss), as can be seen in the 
plot for 10GeV/c and 20 GeV/c Muons. 

Figure 13- Evolution Through The Detector Elements Of  (px/pInteraction, py/pInteraction).  

                   pInteraction Is The Norm Of The Momentum At Start At The Interaction Point  

The input values of the magnetic field fed into the stepper to represent the coil and 
MUDET has been done to follow the simulated hits. The sudden change of slope of the 

13

 
  
  particle at the entrance of the coil is quite un-realistic, we are expecting, a linear decrease, 

in a  real  world. We also expect a stronger bending back of the tracks in MUDET were 
the magnetic field is not correct. . This can be seen in the event display for single muons 
as well as in the track from the stepper shown 3 figures back, while representing x versus 
y for a Muon at 3, 4 5,10,20 and 50 GeV/c. This feature of the event generation needs to 
be corrected.   

At higher energies the particle momentum does not reach zero at the end of the trajectory 
and the particle will go through the non- instrumented Iron in MUDET and even leave 
the detector.

Figure 14- Single Muon Efficiency As A Function of P (GeV/c)-Using The Swimmer Without/  

With Account For An Ad-Hoc dE/dx And With The Stepper With The "Real" dE/dx .  

The Single Muons Efficiency is reported above as a function of p(GeV/c). The lower 
energy efficiency which improved in taking into account of the dE/dx by using a 
Momentum dependant improves now further with the stepper where the loss of energy 
due to dE/dx in subtracted step by step. 
It is mostly at low Momenta that the improvement is more important 
For 3 GeV/c Muons: The Efficiency went from:  0.6%   -> 23%        ->33%      Stepper 
For 4 GeV/c Muons: The Efficiency went from:  ~70%    -> 95.2%   ->96.2%   Stepper 
For 5 GeV/c Muons:  The Efficiency went from:  ~97%  -> ~97%    ->99.6%    Stepper 
For 10GeV/c Muons: The Efficiency went from:  98.96% -> 98.96%->99.98% Stepper 
At higher energy the improvement is subtler.

  Conclusion  

The stepper improves the low momentum muon identification efficiency further and one 
can show that it gets rid of part of the contamination, especially the low energy tracks 
which get stopped and are now flagged as such. Namely, one have seen that in jets, when 
the swimmer was used,  the low momentum tracks  which have a neighbor Muon are 
sometimes wrongly identified as Muons as well. They simply borrow hits in the MUDET 
from that neighbor Muon. When using the stepper those tracks are flagged as stopped 
And will not go through the same fate. 
Many thanks to Philippe Gouffon for important comments and suggestions. Thanks to 
Fritz Dejongh for going through the process. The software of the stepper has benefited 
from advices and suggestions of Margherita Vittone Wiersma. Thanks are also due to 
NIU, Fermilab and A. Zaks for their continuous support.

               2) If the step is really small using the value of the angles in the middle of the 
step,( the a"),  or at the beginning of the step,( the a), does not make a real difference in 
the calculation of the  p due to dE/dx. In the 3 expressions above one replaces  P by the 
value above, where the a s replace the a , one gets, 

|P(n)|, the particle loses energy in the material .

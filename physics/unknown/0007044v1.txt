Abstract

We report the results of a recent beam dynamics study,  motivated by the need to redesign
the LCLS photoinjector, that lead to the discovery of a new effective working point for  a
split RF photoinjector. We consider the emittance compensation regime of a space  charge
beam:  by  increasing  the  solenoid  strength,  the  emittance  evolution  shows  a  double
minimum  behavior  in  the  drifting  region.  If  the  booster  is  located  where  the  relative
emittance      maximum      and the envelope waist occur, the second emittance  minimum  can  be
shifted to the booster exit and frozen at a very low level (0.3  mm-mrad for a 1 nC flat top
bunch), to the extent that the invariant envelope matching conditions are satisfied. Standing
Wave Structures or alternatively Traveling Wave Structures embedded in a Long Solenoid
are both candidates as booster linac. A careful measurement of the emittance evolution as a
function of  position  in  the  drifting  region  is  necessary  to  verify  the  computation  and  to
determine experimentally the proper position of the booster cavities. The new design study
and  supporting  experimental  program  under  way  at  the  SLAC  Gun  Test  Facility  are
discussed.

1  INTRODUCTION

The proposed Linac Coherent Light  Source (LCLS)  is  an
X-ray Free Electron Laser (FEL)  that  will  use  the  final  15
GeV  of  the  SLAC  3-km  linac  for  the  drive  beam.  The
performance  of  the  LCLS  in  the  1.5  Angstrom  regime  is
predicated on  the  availability  of  a 1-nC,  100-A beam  at  the
160-MeV point  with  normalised rms  transverse emittance of
~1 mm-mrad. An  experimental  program  is  underway  at  the
Gun  Test  Facility  (GTF)  at  SLAC  to  demonstrate  a  high-
brightness beam meeting the LCLS  requirements using  an rf
photoinjector  [1].  The  GTF  experiment  uses  a  1.6-cell  S-
band  rf  gun  developed  jointly  with  BNL  and  UCLA  [2]
surrounded by a solenoid just after the gun exit.  After a short
drift  it  is  followed  by  a  standard  SLAC  3-m  accelerating
section.  A  transverse normalised rms  emittance of  2.4  mm-
mrad for a 0.9  nC  pulse  with  10-ps  FWHM  Gaussian pulse
length  has  been  measured  at  BNL  using  a  similar
configuration [3].

Earlier  simulation  studies  using  the  multi-particle  code
PARMELA predicted a transverse normalised emittance of  ~1
mm-mrad -  thermal emittance  not  included  -  for  the  LCLS
photoinjector  if  a  uniform  (or  even  a  truncated  Gaussian)

temporal  charge  distribution  is  used  [4].  While  this  result
technically  meets  the  LCLS  requirements,  it 
leaves  no
headroom  for  errors  or  practical  difficulties.  Consequently
simulation studies have continued with  the  goal  of  finding a
photoinjector  design  for  the  LCLS  that  would  predict  a
transverse emittance of no  more than  0.8  mm-mrad with  the
thermal emittance included.

2  A  NEW  WORKING  POINT  FOR  A

SPLIT  PHOTO-INJECTOR

A  detailed  systematic  PARMELA  analysis  of  the  beam
parameters for a GTF-like  system  can be found in  [5].  Good
emittance performances and high  peak current at  the  exit  of
the device can be obtained with high peak field on the cathode
(140 MV/m),  extraction phase 35  deg and moderate solenoid
field strength (0.3 T) for a 1  nC  uniform  charge distribution
and 10  ps  long  bunch with  1  mm  radius.  In  the  following
analysis we will take these parameters as a starting point.
We adopted the semi-analytical code HOMDYN [6] to  extend
the  investigation  to  the  booster  matching  condition,  taking
advantage of the fast running capability of the code to explore
a  wider  range  of  parameters.  The  invariant  envelope  [7]
matching condition indeed requires the beam to  be injected at
a laminar waist, 
  0, in  a matched accelerating gradient
of the TW booster given by:

¢ =

¢ =g

where Io = 17 kA is  the  Alfven current. While investigating
the  envelope  and  emittance  behaviour  by  scanning  the
solenoid field strength  we noticed an interesting  feature. By
increasing  the  solenoid  strength  the  emittance  evolution
shows  a double minimum  behaviour in  the  drifting  region.
For  a  given  value  of  the  solenoid  strength  (0.31  T)  the
envelope waist  occurs  where  the  emittance  has  its  relative
maximum  (z» 1.5  m)  as  shown  by  the  bold  red  lines  in
Figures 1 and 2.

The performance using  the  new working points  [8]  relies
on this feature of the emittance oscillation. The guess  is  that
if we locate the booster entrance at z »
 1.5 and we satisfy  the
matching condition, the second emittance minimum  could be
shifted to  higher energy and frozen  at  a  lower  level,  taking
advantage of the additional emittance compensation occurring
in the booster.

of 96 A is slightly below the desired value.

3  THE  LCLS  CASE

Figure 4: Peak current and rms energy spread along the

injector beam line.

As a first natural choice for the  booster linac we consider
a 3 m long constant gradient S-band TW structure, in  use  at
SLAC  since  the  1960s.  To  satisfy  the  first  matching
condition the  booster should be  located  at  z=1.5  m,  where
the  beam laminar waist  occurs. Since  the  rms  spot  size  is
x=0.41  mm,  the  current averaged over the  slices  is  96  A,
and  the  average  slice  energy  is  6.4  MeV,  the  matched
accelerating gradient of  the  TW booster is  required to  be 35
MV/m. To drive the beam out of the space charge dominated
regime we need two SLAC structures resulting  in  an energy
of 216 MeV in an 8 m long  injector line,  allowing  a 0.5  m
long drift in between the two structures.

As  expected  the  second  emittance  minimum,  0.5  mm-
mrad, now occurs downstream of  the  booster structures, see
Fig. 3, at  z=10 m  (we will  take this  location  as  a reference
position  to  quote  emittance  at  the  injector  exit).  An
injection  into  the  booster 12  degrees off crest is  enough  to
compensate for the energy spread, resulting in a residual rms
energy spread at the exit of  the  booster of  0.2  %  as  required

Despite the good emittance resulting  from this  design, the

the limit of reliable performance by the SLAC structure.

We then  started to  look  for  a  lower  gradient  solution  by
increasing the focusing properties of  the  device. This  can be
done  by  means  of  a  long  solenoid  around  the  first  TW
structure.  Setting  the  desired  accelerating  field  of  the  TW
section  to  25  MV/m,  a  scanning  of  the  solenoid  strength
showed  a  very  good  working  point  with  B=800  G.  Beam
dynamics simulation showed a very low emittance value,  0.2
mm  mrad, see Fig.  5,  fulfilling  at  the  same  time  the  other
LCLS requirements.

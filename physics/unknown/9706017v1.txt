Abstract. We discuss the phenomenon of preacceleration in the light of a method
of successive approximations used to construct the physical order reduction of a large
class of singular equations. A simple but illustrative physical example is analyzed to
get more insight into the convergence properties of the method.

Introduction

In a recent paper [1] one of the present authors has proposed a numerical implementation
of a method of successive approximations that allows automatic construction of the
order reduction that contains the physical, non-runaway, solutions of a large class of
singular diﬀerential equations, including the classical equation of motion of charged
particles with radiation reaction [2] and fourth-order equations appearing in theories
of gravitation with a quadratic lagrangian [3] and in the study of quantum corrections
to Einstein equations [4]. Apart from its practical interest, the convergence of the
numerical method provides indirect but convincing evidence of the convergence of the
analytic method.

The goal of this letter is twofold: we want to discuss the phenomenon of
preacceleration in the frame of the method of successive approximations and to produce
a more physical exact example in which the method can be analyzed in full detail.

2. Preacceleration

Among the puzzling properties of the Lorentz-Dirac equation [2], which describes the
motion of a radiating point charge, the preacceleration is one of the consequences of its
singular structure. Let us consider the non-relativistic approximation to the Lorentz-
Dirac equation (the so-called Abraham-Lorentz equation) in the case of a charge e that
moves in a straight line under the action of an external force per unit mass f (t):

where

¨x = f (t) + τ0

τ0 ≡

It is well known that if one eliminates the runaway solutions, the physical motion is
described by the integro-diﬀerential equation [5, 2, 1]

If the external force is f (t) = f0 δ(t) it is enough to insert this expression in

equation (3) to obtain the order reduction

According to this the charge would start accelerating before the pulse reaches it.

This phenomenon has been widely discussed in connection with the smallness of τ0
and taking into account the limitations of the classical theory, but we want to analyze

it here from the point of view of the method of successive approximations [1], which
starts from the approximation that neglects completely the radiation reaction

¨x = Θ0(t)

f (t),

≡

and iteratively constructs approximate reductions by substituting the previous
approximation on the right hand side of (1)

Under the appropriate mathematical conditions, this method will converge to the exact
reduction

¨x = Θn+1(t)

f (t) + τ0 Θ′

¨x = Θ(t) =

which is precisely the Taylor expansion of (3).

Now, one of the main hypothesis in the method of successive approximations is
Bhabha’s remark [6] that the physical solutions are precisely those that are regular in
the limit τ0 →
0, where according to (3) and (7) one recovers the second order equation

¨x = f (t).

But we can see that the preaccelerated solution (4) is divergent in the limit τ0 →
0,
exactly as the remaining pathological solutions. In consequence, it cannot be constructed
by the (analytical or numerical) method of successive approximations. One might see
this as a limitation of the latter method, but we think that it is rather a limitation of
the Abraham-Lorentz and similar equations.

To make clear our point of view we will consider a pulse of small but non null width.

For simplicity we will take a Gaussian pulse,
f0
ε√π

e−(t/ε)2

f (t) =

but one could also consider any other pulse that recovers in the limit ε
0 the value
f0 δ(t). After inserting (9) in (3) one gets the Newtonian equation of motion that
contains the physical solutions:

.

This would be precisely the reduction constructed by the method of successive
approximations. By using the properties of the complementary error function, it is
easy to see that in the limit τ0 →
0 one recovers the radiationless result (8), while for
ε
0 one gets the preaccelerated solution (4). We see, thus, that these two limits do
→
not commute.

→

In our opinion the delta function obtained in the limit ε

0 is beyond the ﬁeld
of applicability of Lorentz-Dirac and Abraham-Lorentz equations, for which one has to
assume that the applied force and acceleration do not change too much across a time
interval of length τ0, i.e. the radiation reaction cannot be too important along such a
tiny interval. Since this assumption is not met by the delta function, this often useful
limit is not applicable here and one has necessarily to consider pulses of width larger
than τ0. This opinion is in agreement with the point of view of authors [6, 7, 8] that
stress that the analyticity with respect to τ0 is a fundamental hypothesis, which is used
in standard derivations of the Lorentz-Dirac equation.

3. An exact example

In reference [1] we discussed a linear one-dimensional exact example in the frame of the
method of succesive approximations. We want to analyze now a three-dimensional exact
example that, though still linear, has a clearer physical meaning and will contribute to
our conﬁdence on the convergence of the method of successive approximations under
appropriate conditions. Let us consider a charge e that moves in an external magnetic
ﬁeld B, as happens in some astrophysical contexts [9] or in particle accelerators [10]. In
the non-relativistic approximation the equation of motion is

where we have introduced the cyclotron frequency

which we will assume to be uniform and constant. Starting from the lowest order
approximation

we can construct successive approximations by using repeatedly

but a linear stability analysis proves that P− is always unstable and that P+ is
asymptotically stable for

Furthermore, a simple bifurcation diagram in the dimensionless variables (αn, τ0βn)
shows that the initial condition (1, 0) is in the basin of attraction of P+ and,
in
consequence, that the method of successive approximations will in fact converge in
the range (21) to the Newtonian equation

Notice that all the approximations (15), as well as the exact order reduction (22),
are orthogonal to the magnetic ﬁeld, and that the exact reduction exists even when
the method fails. This is not surprising because most approximation methods have
limited ranges of applicability. Moreover, in this case the method will converge in all
practical situations because the cyclotron frequency is always very small compared to
1/τ0. This simple but illustrative exact example reinforces our conviction that the
numerical approximation method [1] will converge in many cases of interest.

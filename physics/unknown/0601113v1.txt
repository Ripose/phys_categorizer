$EVWUDFW(cid:29) The availability of a number of databases, in particular the 6FLHQFH(cid:3)
&LWDWLRQ(cid:3),QGH[ (SCI), have encouraged the development and use of bibliometric 
techniques to analyze and evaluate the production and impact of scientists. To 
avoid pitfalls and their sometimes serious consequences, however, considerable 
experience with the method is needed. The case of George Placzek appears as an 
excellent one to illustrate the procedure and its problems. Placzek’s work covered a 
broad range of topics, including optical and neutron spectroscopy, neutron 
diffusion, nuclear reactions, and nuclear energy. He worked in a large number of 
places with some of the most outstanding collaborators and also as sole author 
during his short professional life. His publications appeared in regular, so-called 
source journals, in books, lecture notes and also internal reports which were 
classified till several years after the end of the war. In this article we analyze 
Placzek’s work and its impact with the aim of illustrating the power and virtues of 
bibliometric techniques and their pitfalls. 
 
(cid:20)(cid:17)(cid:3),QWURGXFWLRQ(cid:3)
 
The term ELEOLRPHWU\ is usually applied to the quantitative investigation of the 
number of publications of individuals, institutions and/or disciplines and their 
impact as measured by the number of citations they received. The origin of modern 
bibliometry is related to the foundation in 1954, by E. Garfield, of the company 
(XJHQH(cid:3)*DUILHOG(cid:3)$VVRFLDWHV, one year before Placzek’s untimely death in 1955. In 
1960 the company’s name was changed to ,QVWLWXWH(cid:3)RI(cid:3)6FLHQWLILF(cid:3),QIRUPDWLRQ (ISI). 
Its main product at the time was &XUUHQW(cid:3)&RQWHQWV, a booklet containing the table 
of contents of journals selected to be relevant to the progress of science.1 In 1964 
the ISI launched the 6FLHQFH(cid:3)&LWDWLRQV(cid:3),QGH[(cid:3)(SCI), covering at that time 600 
scientific journals. In 1988 the printed SCI was complemented by an electronic 
version and in 1992 the ISI, based in Philadelphia, was bought by the 7KRPVRQ(cid:3)
&RUSRUDWLRQ(cid:17)(cid:3)The next important step was the launching of the :HE(cid:3)RI(cid:3)6FLHQFH(cid:3)
(WoS) in 1997, available through the internet and covering about 7000 so-called 
source journals in all fields of scholarship. For a detailed discussion of bibliometric 
techniques and citation analysis see Moed 2.

The :HE(cid:3)RI(cid:3)6FLHQFH is based on the ISI citation indexes, in particular on the SCI. 
The WoS has probably become the most versatile and user friendly citation 
analysis tool and it is often institutionally available to researchers of many 
organizations. Its competent use, however, requires some experience and 
awareness of possibilities and pitfalls, such as interference with namesakes and 
access to citations of books (usually not source items) provided the citations appear 
in source items. The latter can be performed using the &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK(cid:3)
mode (see below). 
 
In spite of his short scientific life (about 25 years) Placzek is an excellent subject 
for learning the pitfalls and tricks of citation analysis. He only published a few 
articles in source journals (about 30) and many of his citations belong to books, 
book articles and classified reports made available after the war or even after his 
death. His name is not very common (we have only found two namesakes cited 
both after his death).3 4 5 He worked and studied in a wide range of European cities 
- Vienna, Prague, Utrecht (1929), Leipzig (1930), Rome (1931-1932), Copenhagen 
(1932-1938), Paris, Kharkov (1936) - and, after his forced emigration in 1938, in 
Canada (Chalk River) and the United States (Los Alamos, Schenectady, Ithaca, 
Princeton, and most likely others) and even Jerusalem (1935). He entertained close 
connections with some of the leading physicists of the times, as will be seen below. 
Although he was single author of most of his publications in source journals, he 
coauthored a number of them with many of those leading physicists (Amaldi, 
Bethe, Bohr, Frisch, Korff, Landau, Nijboer, Peierls, Teller, Van Hove, Volkoff, 
and possibly others in wartime classified reports). 
 
(cid:21)(cid:17)(cid:3)3XEOLFDWLRQV(cid:3)LQ(cid:3)6RXUFH(cid:3)-RXUQDOV(cid:29)(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)*HQHUDO(cid:3)6HDUFK(cid:3)PRGH(cid:3)RI(cid:3)WKH(cid:3):R6(cid:3)
 
The present version of the :HE(cid:3)RI(cid:3)6FLHQFH has two search modes: *HQHUDO(cid:3)6HDUFK 
mode and &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK(cid:3)mode. The *HQHUDO(cid:3)6HDUFK mode archives and 
reveals publications in source journals starting in the year 1900 (access can be 
confined to more recent dates depending on financial arrangements). Any of the 
authors can be used for the search and also combinations thereof. The results are 
limited to citations (including self-citations) to the papers being queried, appeared 
in source journals only (not books or popular publications). 
 
A printout of the results of the *HQHUDO(cid:3)6HDUFK for “Placzek G” (without any other 
restrictions) is shown in Table 1. The total number of records is rather small. It is 
even reduced from 22 to 20 when one deletes the two homonyms Gary Placzek 
(record 14) and Gregory Placzek (record 18). However, the total number of records 
belonging to George Placzek is increased from 20 to 29 if one adds 9 articles in 
source journals which seem to have been omitted from the Science Citation Index.

Six of these missing articles appeared in the =HLWVFKULIW(cid:3)I(cid:129)U(cid:3)3K\VLN, considered a 
source journal since its inception in 1920 till 1998 when it adopted the name of 
(XURSHDQ(cid:3)3K\VLFV(cid:3)-RXUQDO. However, for reasons unbeknownst to us the issues 
covering the years 1927 to 1947, i.e. those in which Placzek published in this 
journal, are not accessible to the WoS. Among the six excluded papers by Placzek 
is a highly cited one (256 citations) on the rotational structure of Raman bands, 
coauthored with Edward Teller.6 Another highly cited article, by L. Landau and G. 
Placzek (217 citations), dealing with the Landau-Placzek Ratio between Brillouin 
and Raman scattering, is also missing in Table 1. The reason is that it appeared in 
German in the 3K\VLNDOLVFKH(cid:3)=HLWVFKULIW(cid:3)GHU(cid:3)6RZMHWXQLRQ 7, at a time (1934) when 
Soviet journals are not considered source journals by the ISI.

7DEOH(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:17) Publications in source journals and their citations listed in the WoS 
(*HQHUDO(cid:3)6HDUFK(cid:3)mode) under “Placzek G”. Note that records 14 and 18 belong to 
homonyms. 
 
Two additional articles by Placzek are missing pathologically from Table 1. One of 
them, on the Raman Effect of gaseous ammonia, appeared in the =HLWVFKULIW(cid:3)I(cid:129)U(cid:3)
3K\VLN 8 (10 citations) coauthored with E. Amaldi. The other, on the capture of 
slow neutrons, appeared in 1DWXUH(cid:3)
does not appear in the WoS under *HQHUDO(cid:3)6HDUFK. The whole volume 137 of 
1DWXUH is actually missing. Such errors unfortunately are not uncommon for 
publications which predate 1945 and thus have been added to the WoS only 
recently (in 2005). Such publications can be retrieved in the &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK 
mode (see next section). The total number of citations received by these 29 papers 
is 1734. This includes self citations but it does not include incorrect citations 
which, as we well see next, can be often revealed by using the &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)
6HDUFK mode of the WoS. 
 
(cid:22)(cid:17)(cid:3)5HIHUHQFHV(cid:3)WR(cid:3)SXEOLFDWLRQV(cid:3)ZKLFK(cid:3)GLG(cid:3)QRW(cid:3)DSSHDU(cid:3)LQ(cid:3)VRXUFH(cid:3)MRXUQDOV(cid:3)RU(cid:3)(cid:3)

The &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK(cid:3)mode enables access to all references appeared in 
source journals (whether the references are to articles in source journals cited 
either correctly or incorrectly), or references to articles published in non-source 
journals or in books or any other published material (sometimes even unpublished, 
e.g., theses, internal reports, or even private communications). Probably the most 
useful feature of this mode, especially concerning Placzek’s work, is the possibility 
of finding a measure of the impact of a book or a book article, as reflected in the 
citations in source journals. Conference proceedings, even if not published in 
source journals, can also be accessed using the &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK(cid:3)mode. 
 
As an example we deal with the problem of the missing Ref. 9. Because the articles 
in this missing volume of 1DWXUH are not source items, only the first author (Frisch 
O R ) must be queried under the &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK. We then find 7 citations 
for Ref. 9. Care must be taken searching either O R or O* and not OR (without 

 

7 

blank). If the latter is done the system takes OR as a Boolean operator and gives an 
error message. The same procedure can be used to find the citations of Ref. 7. One 
must take into consideration here that the name of the first author deviates from the 
standard form “Landau L D” and the citations (217 citations) must be retrieved 
either under “Landau L” or “Landau L*”. 
 
Placzek published in 1934 in the +DQGEXFK(cid:3)GHU(cid:3)5DGLRORJLH a 270 pages article 
under the title (in German): “Rayleigh scattering and the Raman Effect”. It is 
probably the first comprehensive article on the theory of light scattering published 
after the discovery of the Raman Effect in 1928. In spite of having been written in 
German at a time when Germany’s star was beginning to wane, a &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)
6HDUFK reveals a total of about 986 citations for this article (see Table 2).

Entries 112-114: No details about the corresponding references are given. This must be either an 
oversight or corresponds to private communications. 
 
7DEOH(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:17) Placzek’s publications as appear in the WoS within the &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)
6HDUFK(cid:3)mode. Some of the most obvious cases of reference journal variations have 
been bundled together. The observant reader will still discover many reference 
errors. 
 
We now illustrate on the basis of Table 2 the evaluation of citations to books and 
book chapters by articles in source journals. The second most cited entry in this 
table is listed to have been cited 360 times, having appeared in +DQGEXFK(cid:3)GHU(cid:3)
5DGLRORJLH in 1934 (Vol. 6, page 205). The third entry (280 citations) corresponds 
to the same publication but citing page 209 (and thus appears as if it were a wholly 

 

12 

different publication). The 9th entry (83 citations) corresponds obviously to the 
same publication but the volume is erroneously given as the 2nd, instead of the 6th. 
Hence, although it is the same, it is listed as a fully different publication. A total 
citation count for this book chapter must be performed by hand and include also 
the entries 16 (no page given, 27 citations), 18 (page 71, 24 citations), etc. By now 
it should have become clear that some authors list in the reference the first page of 
the chapter while others give simply the page that they are using. For a 270 page 
article the possibility of errors is rather large. The cumulative citations to the 
+DQGEXFK(cid:3)GHU(cid:3)5DGLRORJLH article are obtained by hand from Table 2 to be 986. 
This is to be regarded as a lower limit corresponding to a single citation per citing 
article. Since a large article, like the one at hand, may be cited several times in a 
citing article, the total number of citations may be somewhat higher. 
 
The outlined procedure can also be applied to the book on neutron diffusion, 
coauthored by Placzek.10 Although the book is known to be highly cited, it appears 
only once on Table 2 (see entry 215 in the Table), where the first author was 
incorrectly given as Placzek. The reason for the missing citations seems to be that 
Placzek is not the correct first author of the book and is thus often not cited in 
connection with it. Searching for the citations to the first author K.M. Case, in the 
&LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK mode one finds many to this book in several variations. 
The sum of all of them leads to a total of 630. The remaining items in Table 2 
correspond to erroneous citations, internal reports, especially declassified ones 
related to the Manhattan project, lecture notes and, last but not least, citations of 
work appeared in non-source journals. The &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK mode allows a 
counting of all references in source items, yielding for Table 2 a total of 2876. The 
630 citations to Ref. 10 should also be added. This gives us a lower limit for the 
total number of citations of 2876 + 630 = 3506. 
 
In order to clarify the rather complicated pattern of the results in Table 2 we show 
in Figure 1 a bar diagram representing the number of citations received by 
Placzek’s articles, books, reports, etc. versus the year of publication. His first 
article, published in the =HLWVFKULIW(cid:3)I(cid:129)U(cid:3)3K\VLN in 1928 and cited 6 times, is based on 
his doctoral thesis performed at the University of Vienna (title: Determination of 
density and shape of submicroscopic test bodies). His second article, published in 
1929, shortly after the discovery of the Raman Effect, dealt with the theory of the 
Raman Effect. The years 1933-1934 represent his “annus mirabilis”, with nearly 
1500 citations. During these years he published the article in the +DQGEXFK(cid:3)GHU(cid:3)
5DGLRORJLH, the work on the rotational spectra of molecules (with E. Teller) and the 
theory of the Landau-Placzek Ratio. In 1952 his most cited article (454 citations) 
appeared in the 3K\VLFDO(cid:3)5HYLHZ, a journal that after emigration took the place of 
the =HLWVFKULIW(cid:3)I(cid:129)U(cid:3)3K\VLN for communicating his work. The title of the paper, of 

 

13 

which he was single author, was “The scattering of neutrons by systems of heavy 
nuclei”. During 1952 he must also have been writing the book in Ref. 10.

)LJXUH(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:17) Citation bar diagram with the number of citations vs. publication year of 
the Placzek papers as listed in Table 2. Note that his contribution to the book in 
Ref. 10 (630 citations) is not included for the reasons given in the text. For the 
meaning of “posthumous” papers see text. 
 
According to Figure 1 there seem to be a few posthumous publications after his 
untimely death in 1955. The most recent one (Geology, 1997) is not his work but 
that of a namesake. However, that listed as published in 1995 corresponds to a 
report of the Manhattan project, cited 5 times (see Table 2) but hard to obtain for 
ordinary mortals. The 1997 paper (7 citations) is actually a publication by Gary 
Placzek, who worked at the US geologic survey. We have succeeded in contacting 
the other namesake who appears as the 18th record in Table 1 (Gregory Placzek). 
He is an undergraduate at the University of Tulsa, majoring in chemistry and is not 
related to George (only a few members of the Brno Placzek clan managed to 
survive the holocaust). The reason why he does not appear in Table 2 or in Figure 
1 is that his paper, an abstract of a talk delivered this year, has no citations (yet). 
The user of the WoS should keep in mind that uncited papers appear in the *HQHUDO(cid:3)

 

14 

6HDUFK mode but not under the &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK(cid:3)mode (after all, they have 
not been cited yet). 
 
The really posthumous publication by George Placzek was submitted in 1956 
(Incoherent neutron scattering by polycrystals), indeed after Placzek’s death.11 It is 
based on sketchy, unpublished notes which, because of their interest, were edited 
and refereed by L. Van Hove, a rather unusual procedure justified only by the 
importance of the work (number 20 in Table 2, 19 citations). Papers No. 31 (1959) 
and 32 (1962) in Table 2 and Figure 1 seem to refer to some English translation of 
paper No. 2, like many of his “pseudo-posthumous” papers unavailable to us. 
 
We include next a figure with the time evolution of the yearly citations of 
Placzek’s most cited papers (1, 2-3, and 4 of Table 2). The citations to the 
+DQGEXFK article (1993) increased drastically from 1960 till 1977, reaching the 
rather high value of 40 citations per year in 1977. They have been falling smoothly 
since then, to reach the still important value of 13 in 2005 (many authors would be 
happy to be cited as frequently 70 years after publication). The decrease may be 
due to the appearance of a large number of books on light scattering.12 Let us not 
forget, however, that the book was written in German and no English translation, if 
extant, is easily available. The citations to the Placzek and Teller article 6 (No. 4 of 
Table 2) follow a similar time evolution, with the vertical axis properly scaled. It 
was also written in German which, by 1975, had lost its appeal as a scientific 
language. The yearly citations of Placzek’s most cited paper, however, after rising 
to a maximum around 1975, have remained nearly constant at around 10 per year.

)LJXUH(cid:3)(cid:21)(cid:17) Citation history of Placzek’s three most cited papers. HBR represents the 
+DQGEXFK(cid:3)GHU(cid:3)5DGLRORJLH. 
 
What else does Figure 2 tell us? The number of citations received by the three 
publications remains nearly constant at a low level till about 1955-1960. They take 
off sometime within this period to reach their maxima around 1975. Because of the 
long period of low citation activity, followed by a big upsurge, they deserve the 
name of VOHHSLQJ(cid:3)EHDXWLHV. 13 One may speculate about the causes for this relatively 
sharp growth in the late fifties. We mention two possibilities: the 6SXWQLN(cid:3)(IIHFW(cid:3)
and the advent of Laser-Raman spectroscopy and also inelastic neutron scattering. 
The launching of 6SXWQLN in 1957 produced a shock in the United States which was 
to be counteracted by massive support and development in the physical science and 
engineering. Raman spectroscopy had remained a rather academic specialty since 
its discovery in 1928, because of the weak light sources available. The invention 
and industrial production of gas lasers resulted in easy accessibility of Raman 
spectroscopy during the mid sixties. The colossal development that followed 
brought to the fore Placzek’s +DQGEXFK article at a time when hardly any in-depth 
publications of the underlying theory were available. 
 

 

16 

The time dependence pattern shown in Figure 2 for the three most cited of 
Placzek’s works is also found for the sum of all citations (cumulative impact). This 
is illustrated in Figure 3 which indicates that his work is still cited at the rate of 
about 35 citing papers per year, a rather remarkable number of citations for 
publications that, on the average, are 75 years old.14

)LJXUH(cid:3)(cid:22)(cid:17) Time dependence of the citations of the ensemble of all Placzek 
publications. The number of FLWLQJ papers versus their year of publication is given. 
The 630 citations of the book by Case and Placzek are not included here. 
 
(cid:23)(cid:17)(cid:3),QIRUPDO(cid:3)FLWDWLRQV(cid:3)E\(cid:3)QDPH(cid:3)RQO\(cid:3)
 
Some contributions to science become household words (e.g. Maxwell´s 
Equations, Bose-Einstein Statistics, the Ginzburg-Landau Equations, the Landau-
Placzek Ratio) and full reference to the original work, in terms of a formal citation, 
is then often not given. Instead, the name of the author or the concept bearing his 
name is given, often in the title, the abstract or the keywords. It then becomes 
difficult for those of us who want to go to the original sources to figure out where 
to find them. This widespread practice may also pose problems for settling priority 

 

17 

issues. Fortunately, the WoS, in its *HQHUDO(cid:3)6HDUFK mode, querying for the name of 
the author as a topic offers the possibility of finding out how many times the author 
is mentioned as an “informal reference” provided his name appears in the title of a 
paper, the abstract, or the keywords.15
 We have found that the name “Placzek” has 
been thus mentioned informally in 118 publications. 
 
It is also possible with the Boolean operators available in the WoS to find out in 
what connection a given author is cited informally. It suffices to look at the title, 
the abstract and/or the keywords of one of the informally citing papers to find out 
one associated concept and then query under “topic” the author’s name followed 
by the Boolean operator AND and the desired concept. The results found for 
Placzek are: 
 

Landau-Placzek Ratio 
Placzek’s approximation 
Placzek’s polarizability 
Placzek’s lemma 
Placzek’s theory 

61 times 
28 times 
17 times 
9 times 
2 times 

 
Although neither Placzek’s approximation nor Placzek’s theory are very tale 
telling terms, the Landau-Placzek Ratio, Placzek’s polarizability and Placzek’s 
lemma have become household words. 
 
We display in Table 3 the number of informal citations for Placzek and his 
prominent coworkers. In all cases except for Frisch and Case it can be easily found 
from the WoS, *HQHUDO(cid:3)6HDUFK mode (under 7RSLF). No such results are given for 
either Frisch, Korff or Case. For Frisch and Korff, the large number of namesakes 
in the biomedical field would impose a rather tedious separation by hand. For 
Case, the various ordinary meanings of the word do not allow the computer to 
recognize it as a family name. For comparison we have added to Table 3 C.V. 
Raman, Raman spectroscopy being one of the fields in which Placzek excelled, 
and two living Nobel laureates, Ginzburg and Hänsch.

* Nobel Laureates 
 
7DEOH(cid:3)(cid:22)(cid:17) Several impact indexes of Placzek, some of his coworkers and, for 
comparison, C.V. Raman and two living Nobel laureates (Ginzburg and Hänsch). 
The informal references are discussed in Sect. 4. The h 16 and IA 17 indexes in 
Sects. 5 and 6, respectively. 
 
Table 3 exposes Landau and Raman as the two giants of the informal citations, 
followed by Teller and Bethe. Landau is mostly informally cited in connection 
with the Ginzburg-Landau Equations (Ginzburg: Nobel Laureate 2003, Landau: 
NL 1962). Bethe (NL 1967) is mostly cited informally in connection with the 

 

19 

Bethe Ansatz. Raman (NL 1930), of course becomes a household word in 
connection with Raman spectroscopy, Placzek in connection with the Landau-
Placzek Ratio. 
 
It is interesting to note that there is no direct correlation between the informal 
citations and the two impact indexes h and IA to be discussed in the next two 
sections. There may actually be some kind of anti-correlation: informal citations 
are often used at the expense of the corresponding formal ones. 
 
(cid:24)(cid:17)(cid:3)7KH(cid:3)+LUVFK(cid:3)LQGH[(cid:3)K(cid:3)
 
This index was introduced recently by J. Hirsch as a measure of the cumulative 
impact of a person’s scientific work within a given discipline.16 It can be easily 
obtained, within a minute or so, provided one has access to the WoS (*HQHUDO(cid:3)
6HDUFK(cid:3)mode) and the number of highly cited namesakes is low. The index h is 
simply defined as the number of articles in source journals that have had h citations 
or more. It is not easy to include books and other items listed in the &LWHG(cid:3)
5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK mode (we do not do it here). The index h increases with the age 
of the scientist and comparison between different disciplines should be avoided 
unless a reliable relative calibration is available.18 
 

Particularly striking is the comparison of the informal references of Raman (a 
whopping 95669) with his low h (18, only slightly higher than that of Placzek). 
The total number of Raman’s citations (1570 as obtained in the &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)
6HDUFK mode) is also considerably lower than that found for Placzek (2627). It is 
easy to conjecture the reason for this apparent discrepancy. The Raman Effect was 
discovered in 1928 and awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930, which made it almost 
immediately a household word. The original source item publication appeared in 
1DWXUH 19 but was cited only 170 times: authors preferred to mention simply Raman 
Effect than give a formal citation. Many of his publications appeared in Indian 
journals which are even now not in the list of source items. As an example we 
mention an article in the 3URF(cid:17)(cid:3)RI(cid:3)WKH(cid:3),QGLDQ(cid:3)$FDG(cid:17)(cid:3)RI(cid:3)6FLHQFHV(cid:3)(cid:21), 406 (1935), cited 
383 times (Raman’s most cited paper). Later issues of this journal are now listed as 
source items. 
 
We conclude the discussion of Table 3 by mentioning E. Amaldi, a close friend and 
coauthor of Placzek. The small number of informal citations corresponds mainly to 
the “Fermi-Amaldi Correlation Terms”. Amaldi’s Hirsch number is only slightly 
higher than that of Placzek inspite of his having been blessed with a much longer 
life (1908-1989). In principle, the impact of early papers and thereby the overall 
impact of pioneers like Niels Bohr are highly underestimated: The proliferation of 

 

20 

science implies a proliferation of citable papers, resulting in increasing ratios of 
references per paper (reference count) and citations per paper, respectively. These 
ratios have approximately doubled within the last half century. Hence, the Hirsch 
numbers of scientists from different time periods are hardly comparable.

The index IA, proposed by O.K. Andersen 17, is obtained with the following 
expression: 

IA=

number of citations
(years of scientific life)

 

2

  
In the above expression the number of citations is usually obtained from the 
*HQHUDO(cid:3)6HDUFK(cid:3)PRGH of the WoS, although a correction for wrong citations based 
on the &LWHG(cid:3)5HIHUHQFH(cid:3)6HDUFK(cid:3)PRGH can also be included. The years of scientific 
life are taken to include the period from the first publication (this has been done 
here but sometimes the year in which the PhD was granted is taken) till present if 
the author is alive or till the year of his death (the latter applies to all authors in 
Table 3 except Ginzburg and Hänsch). The square in the denominator of the 
expression has been included to keep IA constant whenever the number of citations 
per publication and the number of publications per year remains constant 
throughout the scientific life. 
 
The highest IA index in the upper part of Table 3 is that of Landau (6.19). This 
number is, however, rather low compared with present day authors of similar 
caliber (The IA index of this year’s Nobel laureate T.W. Hänsch is 9.57). This 
effect is even more striking in the case of H. Bethe (3.46) who enjoyed a rather 
long (scientific) life, thus enhancing the denominator of the above expression 
while his productivity decreased in the later years of his life. Amaldi stayed in Italy 
during and after the war. His productivity decreased significantly during this 
period.20 Even during the recovery after 1950, his productivity remained low. He 
was heavily involved in rebuilding Italian science at the political and 
administrative level, including the promotion of large national and international 
projects (CERN, Frascati, the European Space Agency). He was also involved in 
projects and workshops dealing with disarmament and the peaceful use of atomic 
energy, obviously at the expense of conventional scientific research. Hence his low 
IA number (0.40). The other IA giants in Table 3 are E. Teller (5.35) and L. Van 
Hove (5.90). The IA of G. Placzek (2.0) falls somewhere in the middle. It would be 
increased by about a factor of two if his highly cited book and book article were 
included.

We have performed a bibliometric (citations) analysis of Placzek’s scientific 
publications. His variegated and tragic life offers an excellent case study for such 
analysis. We conclude that Placzek ranks according to standard bibliometric 
impact indexes, and in spite of his untimely death, among the giants of his life 
period, many of whom are found as coauthors in his publications.

 This selection, performed by the ISI, is based on the so-called Bradford’s law 
(1953) which loosely interpreted states that of all journals dealing with scientific 
issues, only a small proportion (~10 %) are relevant to the progress of science. The 
relevant journals, as selected by the ISI according to well defined criteria and 
revised at regular intervals, are called source journals. For a detailed discussion of 
modern bibliometric methods see Ref. 2.

11 The posthumous publication has the following footnote: “The present note 
contains results obtained by George Placzek a few years ago and never published, 
except in very fragmentary form as a Letter to the Editor [G. Placzek, Phys. Rev. 
(cid:28)(cid:22), 895 (1954)]. In view of the importance of these results for actual computation 
of slow-neutron scattering cross sections, it was considered useful to publish them 
after Dr. Placzek's death, as a complement to the above-mentioned letter. The 
author's original notes have been reviewed and edited for publication by L. Van 
Hove, Utrecht, Netherlands.”

Abstract 

The  temperature-dependent  photoluminescence  (PL)  spectra  of  zinc  oxide  (ZnO)  nanocrystals 

deposited inside the ultraviolet (UV) opal were studied. ZnO was grown in the voids between FCC 

packed  SiO2  spheres  using  spray  pyrolysis  under  ultrasonic  vibration  in  the  solution  containing  a 

zinc nitrate precursor. The ZnO nanoparticles inside opal matrix with UV photonic band-gap exhibit 

suppression of the excitonic emission and enhancement of the deep level emission. Suppression of 

the  excitonic  lines  is  due  to  the  inhibition  of  spontaneous  emission,  while  enhancement  and 

broadening of the DL emission in the green spectral region is due to Purcell effect. The infiltration 

of ZnO inside the photonic crystal may be a useful technique to increase its emission efficiency in 

the selected spectral region.

I. Introduction 

Zinc oxide (ZnO) is mostly n-type semiconductor, which has many attractive features. Due to 

its unique properties in electrical and optical characteristics ZnO is considered a liable material for a 

variety of applications in the visible and near ultraviolet (UV) spectra. ZnO is a chemically stable 

direct zone semiconductor with wide band-gap (3.32 eV) and relatively high ecxiton binding energy 

(60  meV).  It  is  transparent  to  most  of  the  solar  spectrum  and  therefore  ZnO  thin  films  are  widely 

used in industry as a window material for low-cost solar cells, optical wave-guides, light modulators, 

and  optical  sensors.  The  recent  publications  show  that  ZnO  can  be  successfully  applied  as  a 

nanowire  Schottky  diode  [1]  and  a  transparent  field  effect  transistor  [2],  which  can  find  its 

application  as  a  switching  element  in  displays.  In  addition,  ZnO  is  regarded  a  promising 

semiconductor  for  fabrication  of  the  various  optoelectronic  devices  with  high  light  emission 

efficiency and durability. 

Nowadays such advanced techniques as the pulsed laser deposition [3], magnetron sputtering 

[4], chemical vapour deposition (CVD) [5] and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [6] are mostly used 

to  fabricate  ZnO.  These  techniques  enable  the  deposition  of  single  crystal  ZnO  almost  without 

crystal defects. Due to high crystal quality, ZnO may exhibit only band-edge emission even above 

room  temperature.  However  all  of  them  are  highly  expensive  and  their  applications  may  be        

cost-effective for the fabrication of single crystal ZnO. 

However polycrystalline ZnO may also be very useful for many applications. For instance, 

polycrystalline ZnO has recently attracted much attention as efficient luminescent phosphor for the 

low-voltage flat panel displays [7-9]. The simple, inexpensive and safe technique, which can serve 

for such a purpose is spray pyrolysis (SP).

SP  is  very  technological  utilizing  just  a  solvent  with  precursor  such  as  zinc  nitrate  or  zinc 

acetate.  It  is  particularly  effective  for  the  deposition  of  various  semiconductors  with  nanosize 

particles. Recent publications show that it can be successfully applied for fabrication of the bright 

color  phosphors  [10-12].  Furthermore,  SP  employs  a  precursor  solution  whereby  the  uniform 

distribution of nanoparticles in the voids of a porous material can be archived by soaking a sample 

under ultrasonic vibration. 

II. Preliminaries 

Various  applications  of  photonic  crystals  (PhCs),  proposed  by  E.  Yablonovich  [13]  and  S. 

John  [14],  are  aimed  to  enhance  the  useful  optical  characteristics  of  the  opto-electronic  devices. 

Among  numerous  properties  of  PhCs,  their  ability  to  suppress  spontaneous  emission  band  [15]  is 

one of the most remarkable. This effect, the suppression of the radiative recombinations, is observed 

due to the inhibition of spontaneous emission in the luminescence spectrum, common with photonic 

band-gap. In fact, the suppression of the emission band leads to the strong spectral redistribution of 

emission intensity. Therefore the application of PhC may be very effective to modify a spectrum of 

the spontaneous emission. 

Artificial opal is one of the kinds of PhCs, which fabrication is relatively simple and cheap. 

It is packed into FCC matrix by means of self-sedimentation in a fluid containing sub-micron size 

spheres  (host  material).  The  main  disadvantage  in  fabrication  of  artificial  opal  is  the  long  time  of 

self-sedimentation process. Usually for fabrication of the high quality tree-dimensional (3D) matrix, 

the self-sedimentation process can continue up to several months and sometimes even more than a 

 

 

year.

In  the  present  study  the  host  material  of  opal  matrix  is  silicon  dioxide  (SiO2),  while  the 

infiltrated  luminescent  material  is  ZnO.  The  photonic  band-gap  of  the  bare  opal  depends  on  the 

average  diameter  of  the  host  material  and  its  index  of  refraction.  Infiltrated  luminescent 

nanoparticles alter the photonic band-gap position because of change in effective index of refraction. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  color  of  opal  determines  a  forbidden  spectral  zone  since  the  light 

matching the photonic band-gap is bounced back from its surface. 

Unlike other PhCs, the artificial opal can be fabricated to cover a large area over a plane or 

slightly dipped surface. Moreover, it is quite possible to achieve a filling factor above 90% inside 

inverted opal, which can be obtained by removing a host material in an acid after initial infiltration. 

The feasibility to cover a large area and to achieve the high filling factor signifies that the infiltration 

of ZnO into 3D opal matrix may be very promising for fabrication of bright phosphors for full-color 

displays. 

Typically  the  PL  spectra  of  ZnO  consist  of  excitonic  emission  in  the  near  UV  region  and 

deep level (DL) emission mostly in the green and partly in the yellow and red spectral regions. The 

DL emission in ZnO strongly manifests in the polycrystalline structure due to high density of native 

defects such as oxygen vacancies and Zn interstitials [9, 16, 17]. 

The PL spectra exhibiting a narrow excitonic emission on ZnO thin (90 nm) film deposited 

on the surface of artificial opal by electron-beam sputtering was reported by A. N. Gruzintsev et al 

[18,  19].  Thin  ZnO  film  was  sputtered  on  the  surface  of  artificial  opal  representing  a  two-

dimensional  (2D)  periodic  array  of  quantum  dots  distributed  between  279  nm  SiO2  spheres  (red 

opal). The narrowing of the excitonic emission originated from ZnO quantum dots was observed due 

to the quantum confinement effect. 

The  novel  approach  towards  fabrication  a  3D  matrix  containing  FCC  packed  colloidal 

spheres  of  ZnO  was  developed  by  E.  W.  Seelig  et  al  [20].  It  was  demonstrated  that  at  least                

 

4

a quasi-3D matrix, i.e. few layers of the self-assembled ZnO colloidal spheres, is feasible to achieve 

by natural sedimentation in the fluid suspension. The main advantage of such a configuration is a 

very high filing factor of ZnO, which can be increased up to 74%. 

The  precursor  solutions  can  be  used  to  fill  the  voids  of  artificial  opal  with  various 

nanoparticles such as ZnS, ZnO, fluorescent oxides and chlorides [21]. For instance, the complete 

3D periodic array of ZnO can be prepared by chemical deposition from aqueous solution containing 

a  zinc  nitrate  or  zinc  acetate  precursor  followed  by  thermal  annealing  [22-28].  The  first  reports 

dedicated  to  ZnO  nanoparticles  grown  inside  the  volume  of  the  artificial  opal  showed  that  the 

complete filling of the 3D matrix can be used as an efficient technique to modify the PL emission of 

ZnO [22, 23]. The green porous opal has been chosen as a 3D matrix, since its photonic band-gap 

overlaps the DLs in the electronic band-gap. As a result of the inhibition of spontaneous emission, 

the ZnO nanoparticles grown in the voids between 220-240 nm SiO2 spheres exhibit the dominant 

UV-blue emission, since DL emission is suppressed in the green region.  

In earlier publications we assumed that in PL spectra of ZnO nanoparticles deposited inside 

the  artificial  opal  with  ultraviolet  (UV)  photonic  band-gap  could  be  used  to  observe  the  reverse 

effect, i.e. the suppression of the UV-blue emission and enhancement of the green emission. For the 

photonic  band-gap  occupying  near  UV  spectrum,  the  corresponding  average  diameter  of  SiO2 

spheres  should  be  around  ~  160  nm  [23,  26].  Due  to  optical  match  between  the  UV  light  and 

photonic  band-gap  of  opal  matrix,  the  radiative  recombination  rate  originating  through  excitons 

might be decreased as a result of the inhibition of spontaneous emission. 

This  paper  reports  the  temperature-dependent  PL  spectra  of  the  ZnO  deposited  inside  UV 

opal by using SP under ultrasonic vibration. The PL spectroscopy shows several conclusive factors 

supporting an assumption that the enhancement of the DL emission is due to the influence of PhC. 

Particularly,  the  excitonic  emission  from  ZnO  embedded  UV  opal  is  suppressed,  while  its  DL 

 

5

emission  is  strongly  enhanced  and  broadened.  Furthermore,  the  band  edge  emission  from  ZnO 

powder  rapidly  increases,  while  the  emission  from  ZnO  embedded  UV  opal  does  not  exhibit 

excitonic lines with decreasing temperature. 

III. Experimental 

3.1 Synthesis and self-sedimentation of SiO2 spheres 

The  sub-micron  size  spheres  of  silicon  dioxide  were  synthesized  in  Stöber-Fink-Bohn 

process [29] through the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in the ethanol solution mixed 

with ammonium hydroxide and water. The average diameter of the SiO2 spheres can be controlled 

varying  the  temperature  of  the  TEOS  hydrolysis  and  the  concentrations  of  ammonium  hydroxide 

and  water.  An  increase  of  the  ammonium  hydroxide  results  to  the  larger  sizes  of  the  spherical 

particles. On the contrary, the increase of the water concentration results to the smaller sizes of the 

spherical  particles.  Typically,  the  hydrolysis  of  TEOS  in  ethanol  solution  with  ammonium 

hydroxide and water enables the synthesis of the spherical particles with diameters ranging between 

0.02 – 2.0 µm. 

The  artificial  opal  was  assembled  as  a  FCC  packed  3D  matrix  by  natural  sedimentation  of 

SiO2  spheres  in  water  suspension.  After  sedimentation,  the  water  was  slowly  evaporated  at  the 

temperature 60-80  oC. Self-assembled FCC packed matrix is mechanically fragile, therefore it was 

sintered for several hours at temperature 1000 oC. 

This technique enables the fabrication the SiO2 spheres with small, less than 10%, deviation 

from  their  average  size.  The  more  complete  description  of  the  synthesis  of  the  SiO2  spheres  in 

Stöber-Fink-Bohn  process  and  self-assembled  3D  matrix  formation  by  natural  sedimentation  in 

water can be found elsewhere [30, 31].

3.2 Spray pyrolysis technique and ZnO formation 

SP is a technique for chemical deposition of various films, based on a spraying of precursor 

molecules  on  a  heated  surface.  The  process  of  pyrolysis  is  the  chemical  decomposition  occurring 

under high temperature. Particularly ZnO nanoparticles are formed on the surfaces of SiO2 spheres 

as a result of the chemical decomposition of precursor molecules. 

Generally,  the  deposition  of  ZnO  by  means  of  precursor  solution  and  thermal  annealing  is 

also  referred  as  sol-gel  [26]  and  chemical  deposition  [24,  25,  27].  However,  sol-gel  may  not  be 

precise  and  complete  according  to  its  definition  to  describe  the  process  of  thermal  decomposition 

employing the precursor solution technique. Another name, the chemical deposition, is very general, 

since it can be referred to any kind of chemical depositions. SP exactly and completely describes the 

process  of  formation  of  ZnO  nanoparticles  taking  place  as  a  result  of  spraying  of  precursor 

molecules and the process of pyrolysis (thermal decomposition). 

The  complete  chemical  name  of  the  precursor  is  zinc  nitrate  hexahydrate,  Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 

which looks like white or slightly greenish powder. ZnO was deposited using 0.1 M deionized water 

solution containing the precursor of 99.999% purity. The chemical synthesis of ZnO is described by 

the following schematics:

In  water  solution,  zinc  nitrate  hexahydrate  is  decomposed  to  zinc  hydrogenous  and  nitrogenous 

compounds such as zinc dihydroxide, dizinc oxide nitrate, and zinc hydroxide nitrate, respectively, 

as shown in the parentheses of the schematics. The proportion between these zinc hydrogenous and 

nitrogenous compounds depends on temperature of the solution. Under thermal annealing, the zinc 

hydrogenous  and  nitrogenous  compounds  are  further  decomposed  to  ZnO,  nitrogen  oxides,  and 

 

7

oxygen  molecules.  The  more  detailed  description  of  the  chemical  synthesis  of  zinc  oxide  from 

aqueous solution containing zinc nitrate precursor can be found elsewhere [17, 32]. 

To infiltrate a sample, the 1 mm-thick opal slab was initially soaked in aqueous solution with 

zinc nitrate precursor for 48 h. To remove air from the voids and to improve the fluid flow, the opal 

slab  was  soaked  under  ultrasonic  vibration.  The  long  ultrasonic  vibration  is  not  desirable  since  it 

may destroy the ZnO nanoparticles and damage the sample. Therefore the sonification process was 

performed only for a limited time, 3 h in each infiltration cycle. 

After  soaking  in  the  precursor  solution,  the  opal  slab  was  dried  in  the  drying  oven  at 

temperature  50  oC  for  3h  and  annealed  at  500  oC  for  1  h.  The  artificial  opal  is  a  porous  material, 

therefore  the  solution  is  able  to  penetrated  effectively  inside  the  volume  resulting  in  a  uniform 

distribution of ZnO nanocrystals between the SiO2 spheres. It should be noted that the DL emission 

intensity of ZnO strongly depends on annealing as well as drying temperatures. The filling factor of 

ZnO  grown  inside  the  artificial  opal  can  be  controlled  by  concentration  of  the  precursor  and  by 

number of infiltration cycles. However the high concentration of the precursor in aqueous solution 

may deteriorate the uniformity of ZnO inside the matrix. 

To improve the penetration of the precursor solution inside the sample, the ZnO layers were 

removed from the opal surfaces by polishing and cleaning after each infiltration cycle. Finally, for 

the  proper  PL  measurements,  ZnO  layers  were  removed  in  diluted  HF  water  solution  since  their 

contribution may be strong enough to screen the effect of the photonic band-gap on the PL spectra. 

As a reference sample, a ZnO powder was also deposited on the crystalline quartz substrate 

(α-quartz) under similar conditions.

3.3 Measurements 

PL and transmittance spectra were obtained using a SPEX spectrometer equipped with 0.75 

m grating monochromator. PL measurements were performed under 10 mW helium-cadmium laser 

excitation  source  operating  at  wavelength  325  nm.  A  xenon-mercury  lamp  was  employed  as  a 

broadband light source. A photo-multiplier tube Hamamatsu R943-02 was used as a photo-detector. 

The  filling  fraction  of  ZnO  was  determined  gravimetrically,  i.e.  by  weighing  a  porous  UV  opal 

before and after infiltration on Electronic Analytical Balance ER-182A. The morphology of the ZnO 

embedded  UV  opal  and  nanoparticles  were  investigated  using  a  scanning  electron  microscope 

(SEM)  XL-30  PHILIPS.  The  temperature  in  the  chamber  was  controlled  between  10  and  300  K 

using the CRYODINE He displex system. 

IV. Results and discussion 

Figure  1  shows  the  general  morphology  SEM  image  of  the  artificial  opal.  The  3D  opal 

matrix  consists  of  the  SiO2  spheres  packed  into  FCC  structure.  The  diameters  of  the  spheres  vary 

between  160  –  175  nm.  Inset  in  Figure  1  shows  the  SEM  image  of  the  typical  ZnO  nanoparicles 

deposited  by  spray  pyrolysis  method.  The  structure  of  the  ZnO  is  polycrystalline,  consisting  of 

nanoparticles  with  sizes  ranging  between  5  –  20  nm.  The  average  size  of  the  ZnO  nanoparticles 

obtained by means of SP can be less than 10 nm [33]. 

Figure 2 shows the transmittance characteristics of the UV opal before and after infiltration 

with ZnO nanoparticles. For the bare UV opal, the influence of the photonic crystal on transmittance 

manifests as a dip with minimum at 396 nm. However, the effect  of the photonic band-gap is not 

evident for the ZnO embedded UV opal since its transmittance just tends to zero at the wavelengths 

below  390-400  nm.  The  absence  of  the  dip  in  transmittance  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  ZnO 

 

 

9

nanoparticles strongly absorb the incident light. As a result of the band-to-band absorption, the light 

propagating through the sample containing ZnO nanoparticles rapidly decreases screening the effect 

of photonic band-gap in transmittance spectrum. 

However, the influence of the photonic crystal can be seen detecting the light reflected from 

the surface of the ZnO infiltrated sample. Inset in Figure 2 shows the reflectance of ZnO embedded 

UV opal.  The light reflected from the artificial opal travels the distance of few SiO2 spherical layers 

before it bounces back due to photonic band-gap. Therefore, the round trip of the light is not long 

enough to be absorbed by ZnO nanoparticles. The maximum of the reflectance located at 408 nm is 

red-shifted with respect to minimum of transmittance of the bare UV opal. The red-shift indicates 

the presence of ZnO nanoparticles in the voids of opal matrix. 

The filling factor can be estimated employing the following equation [34]

  into  Eq.  (4),  the 

approximate  filling  factor  was  found  to  be  ~  2.8%.  This  magnitude  matches  reasonably  well  the 

filling factor determined gravimetrically (~ 2.3%). 

Figure  3  shows  the  temperature-dependent  PL  spectra  of  the  ZnO  powder.  The  band  edge 

emission  increases  with  decreasing  temperature.  The  PL  spectra  exhibit  the  strong  and  broad 

emission peak in the green region near 2.38 eV (520 nm). This emission peak is commonly observed 

in the spectra of the ZnO bulks, films, and powders and attributed to native defects.  

 

11

At  300  K,  the  intensities  of  the  excitonic  peak  at  3.28  eV  and  DL  peak  at  2.38  eV  are 

approximately  equal.  However  at  10  K,  the  intensity  of  the  excitonic  emission  peak  at  3.37  eV  is 

more than three times higher than the intensity of the DL emission peak. Initially, the increase of the 

band  edge  emission  is  relatively  rapid  with  decreasing  temperature.  However,  the  band  edge 

emission increases insignificantly below 80 K. 

At  300  K  the  emission  peak  located  at  3.28  eV  is  attributed  to  free  exciton  (XA).  At  low 

temperatures, three distinct emission lines are observed at 3.37, 3.315, and 3.232 eV. The emission 

line located at 3.37 is attributed to free exciton, while the emission lines located at 3.315 and 3.232 

eV are attributed to donor-acceptor pairs [37]. The positions of the excitonic and donor-acceptor pair 

emission lines for the ZnO powder are those for the bulk ZnO. The blue-shift due to the quantum 

confinement is not observed since the ZnO nanoparticles are not physically isolated, i.e. they are in a 

physical contact with each other. 

Figure  4  shows  the  temperature-dependent  spectra  of  ZnO  embedded  UV  opal.  The  DL 

emission  with  maximum  near  2.3  eV  (540  nm)  is  strong  and  very  broad.  Apart  from  the  green 

spectrum, the DL emission includes the complete yellow and part of the red spectra. The relatively 

strong red emission peak is located near 1.68 eV (740 nm).  This emission peak is associated with 

recombination centers in the crystal lattice of ZnO also originating through native defects [38]. 

Comparing Figures 4 with 2, one can see that the DL emission peak of ZnO embedded UV 

opal is consistent with absorption minimum in the green region. Therefore the minimum observed 

near  540  nm  in  the  transmittance  spectrum  of  ZnO  embedded  UV  opal  might  be  related  to  the 

absorption of the light through native defects. 

Inset in Figure 4 shows the PL spectra of the reference sample and ZnO embedded UV opal. 

In contrast to the PL spectra of the ZnO powder, the band edge emission of ZnO embedded UV opal 

remains  negligible  even  at  low  temperatures,  while  its  DL  emission  is  significantly  enhanced  and 

 

12

broadened.  The  magnitudes  of  FWHM  associated  with  native  defects  are  102  and  178  nm  for  the 

spectra of ZnO powder and ZnO embedded UV opal, respectively. The comparison between the PL 

spectra  of  the  ZnO  embedded  UV  opal  measured  at  10  and  300  K  shows  a  slight  blue-shift  and 

narrowing  of  the  DL  emission  with  decreasing  temperature.  In  the  red  region,  the  emission  peak 

located around 740 nm (1.68 eV) manifests significantly from ZnO embedded UV opal even above 

room temperature, while the nearly visible red emission peak from ZnO powder appears only at low 

temperatures. 

Presumably,  the  enhancement  and  broadening  of  the  DL  emission  is  due  to  Purcell  effect 

[39,  40].  The  photonic  band-gap  of  the  UV  opal  occupies  the  near  UV  region  overlapping  the 

excitonic emission spectrum. As a result, the band edge emission is suppressed due to the inhibition 

of spontaneous emission. Since the emission in the near UV region is forbidden, the PL intensity is 

redistributed  and  released  through  allowed  radiative  recombinations  in  the  spectra  outside  the 

photonic band-gap [15] ultimately leading to the enhancement and broadening of the PL intensity in 

the green region. 

It  should  be  noted  that  the  feasibility  of  deposition  of  Mg Zn O  nanoparticles  employing 

x

1-x

the similar solution technique has been shown [41]. Since the concentration of Mg can be controlled, 

the infiltration of the ZnO and its compounds inside the UV artificial opal by means of the precursor 

solution  might  be  promising  for  the  fabrication  of  the  efficient  luminescent  phosphors  with  DL 

emission extended to the blue region direction.

V. Conclusion 

SP under ultrasonic vibration was used for growth of ZnO nanocrystals in the volume of the 

UV opal. To fill the voids between 160-175 nm SiO2 spheres with ZnO, the opal matrix was soaked 

in aqueous solution containing a zinc nitrate precursor and thermally annealed. 

The enhancement and broadening of the PL intensity in the green region might be attributed 

to  Purcell  effect.  Since  the  band  edge  emission  is  forbidden,  the  emission  energy  is  spectrally 

redistributed leading to the broadened and enhanced DL emission through native defects like oxygen 

vacancies and Zn interstitials.  

The feasibility of artificial opal to cover the large area over a plane surface indicates that its 

infiltration  with  ZnO  nanoparticles  may  be  promising  for  application  in  full-color  displays. 

Presumably,  the  MgxZn1-xO  nanoparticles  grown  in  the  voids  of  UV  opal,  employing  a  similar 

solution technique, might exhibit the DL emission extended towards blue spectrum. Infiltration of 

the luminescent ZnO inside the artificial opal can be used to enhance its emission efficiency in the 

This  work  is  supported  by  the  Korea  Science  and  Engineering  Foundation  through  the 

Quantum-functional  Semiconductor  Research  Center,  and  by  the  research  program  and  fund  of 

selected spectral region.

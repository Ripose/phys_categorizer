Abstract 

We propose a scenario that explains many of the Pacific Ocean climate phenomena that 
are called El Niño/ La Niña. This scenario requires an event, which we call a Super-Niño 
Event. It dominates other phenomena when it occurs. A template of this event has been 
constructed giving the time evolution, which is an alternating sequence of 'El Niños' and 
'La Niñas'. The duration of the event is about 15 years unless some other event 
intervenes. Three such events can explain most of the El Niño/La Niña features that have 
been observed since 1968. We find that the various El Niño/La Niña features that have 
been observed fall into types, associated with the oscillation in the template, which can be 
classified by a "Periodic Table". The Earth is presently experiencing one of these events 
which started in the mid 1990's and will continue for another 4-5 years. This 
extrapolation into the future suggests that a minor El Niño will begin in mid 2001 and 
will reach a maximum about a year later. The conditions under which such a Super Niño-
Event may occur are discussed.

I. Introduction 
 
There is considerable interest in the Pacific Ocean climate disturbances, El Niño (warm 
episodes) and La Niña (cool episodes), and their world-wide effects. The scientific 
measurements that seem to be related to these climate effects are the Sea Surface 
Temperature anomaly (SST) and the Southern Oscillation Index anomaly (SOI). SST is 
the deviation from a baseline of the mean temperature in a particular region of the Pacific 
Ocean and SOI is the pressure difference between two points, Darwin and Tahiti, also in 
the Pacific. (See Trenberth (1997) and Barnston et al. (1997). The geographic regions 
where these measurements are made are shown in fig.1 Measurements of SST and SOI 
for these regions are shown in figure 2A. 
 
The definition of an El Niños/ La Niña event has been addressed by Trenberth (1997). He 
defines an event if the SST signal exceeds in magnitude 0.4 °C and lasts for at least 5 
months; he has compiled a list of events satisfying these criteria. We have re-listed all his 
events since 1967 in table 1 along with other events that we will discuss.  
 
Correlations between SST and SOI were shown by Bjerknes (1966) to be important and 
phenomena that involve both are referred to as El Niño/ Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 
effects. Barnston et al. (1997) showed that SOI measurements had the highest correlation 
at zero delay with the SST region designated Niño 3.4 , which is the one we use. 
 
These ENSO phenomena have been variously described as: 'having an interval of 3-7 
years'; 'intervals with no La Niñas'; 'intervals with long El Niños being rare'; etc. One 
concludes that the characterization, the occurrence, and the magnitude of these events are 
not completely understood or well defined. The approach in this investigation is to study 
the largest events in the hope that these may be the key to greater understanding. 
 
From the SST and SOI data in fig. 2A it is seen that, in fact, certain large amplitude 
events do stand out. The most recent 1997-98 event and before that the 1982-1983 event 
are two such examples. One might expect if an event were large enough, then it might 
dominate all other effects and that during this time interval one could learn about the 
intrinsic nature of the underlying phenomena. Perhaps it is not unlike where the study of 
the motion of the Earth during a large earthquake leads to knowledge of the normal 
modes of vibration and relaxation times of the Earth. 
 
We have assumed that there is an underlying phenomenon associated with these large 
events and that when it occurs it is an independent event with an intrinsic behavior. We 
give it the name Super Niño (SN). Given this assumption, the task is to discover the 
nature of the event. From examination of the SST and SOI data we have found that three 
particular recent large events (the two mentioned above plus the 1972-1973 event) can be 
used to determine the SN event and its time evolution. It is determined quantitatively and 
is represented by a function, which we call the template. 
 
The found SN template is an oscillating function of time with several maxima and 
minima, which are enumerated by indices [-2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3]. See the schematic of fig 

 

2

2B. The maxima are identified with El Niños and are given even index numbers; the 
largest maximum is the one associated with the term 'El Niño' as it is commonly used and 
has index 0.  The minima are identified with La Niñas and have odd index numbers; the 
index +1 is the one usually associated with the term 'La Niña'. 
 
Three such SN events are sufficient to explain most of the data. The observed El Niño/La 
Niña features in the data. are identified with the various maxima and minima of the SN 
template.  In addition, we have created a classification scheme based upon the SN 
template and the sequence indices, which we call a 'Periodic Table'. This Periodic Table 
accommodates most of the events  listed in table 1.  The template can also be used to 
predict future values of SST and SOI.  These results are explained and discussed below. 
 
 
II. The data  
 
The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) data are 
monthly values, which can be obtained on the web; see Garrett (2000). 
 
These data are shown in fig 2A. The upper curve is for SST and the lower is SOI. The 
positive regions of SST and the negative regions of SOI are filled with red. These are 
associated in the literature with what are called El Niños. The other regions are filled with 
blue and are associated with what are called La Niñas. Visual inspection of these two data 
sets shows a strong correlation between the SST and SOI. We calculate a correlation r =  
-0.85. (This is close to the value  -0.83 found by Barnston et al. [2] for the 1950-1996 
interval.) 
 
There are 3 large events labeled SN1 (72-73), SN2 (82-83), and SN3 (97-99) that we 
identify as Super Niño-Events (SN) [defined in table 2]. Inspection of any of the three SN 
in either data set shows an alternation of minimum and maximum values that is 
suggestive of a common pattern. The pattern that we have found is illustrated in the 
schematic shown in fig 2B.  We show below that these 3 time segments are the only ones 
which show a large correlation with the template over the data range [1950 - 2000].  Thus 
the large SST peak at 1992 is not an SN event nor were any found from 1950 to 1969.  
Also there are various SST datasets prior to 1950, but none are of the integrity of the data 
we used. 
 
III. Analysis 
 
Stacking and Templates 
 
The three selected large events are compared for similarity. They are described in table 2. 
The SST data for the 3 designated SN events were 'stacked'; i.e. plotted so that their 
maxima coincided (See fig 3A); this is sometimes called "compositing".  The maxima, 
minima, and zero crossings of these 3 events are seen to be similar. This strongly 
suggests a common basic underlying intrinsic behavior, which can be expressed by a 
unique function, which we call a template  

 

3

 
We constructed the SST template from the weighted average of the three 
data sets in fig 3A and it is shown in fig 3B. A similar template can be constructed from 
the SOI data using the SST times.  A correlation r = 0.945, was found between the two 
templates.  Because of the high correlation, one can use either template.  We chose SST, 
and present the rest of the analysis with only SST.  The beginning and end of the template 
are not precisely known because of "noise."  We show the "middle" 10 years.  
 
Comparisons Function and Forecast 
 
An SST comparison curve, shown in fig4A, was generated for each SST SN event by 
fitting the SST template to the maximum SST amplitude.  The correlations of the 
comparison curves with the SST data in the SN regions (time segments) are given in table 
2. All three correlation coefficients exceed 0.9 A moving correlation of the SST template 
against the entire range [1950 - 2000] of SST data was computed. The only values larger 
than 0.5 are the three values in the table. We thus conclude that only the three regions 
found can be described by the template. 
 
It should be noted that the comparison curve for the SN3 event extends beyond the end of 
the present data [July 2000]. This extension to 2004 constitutes a 'forecast' provided that 
no other event intervenes. A magnification of fig 4A for the years 1994-2005 is shown in 
fig 4B. Shown in fig 4B are the forecasts from Landsea (2000); CCA model and the 
NCEP model [see Wang et al (2000)]. Landsea uses a model known as ENSO-CLIPER 
(CLImatology PERsistence) as a basis for evaluating fourteen predictors.  The Canonical 
Correlation Analysis (CCA) model makes predictions based on patterns found in the 
global SST.  The National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) has developed a 
coupled ocean-atmosphere model. 
 
IV. Discussion and Conclusions 
 
The Super Niño-Event and the 'Periodic Table'. 
 
   A major result of this paper is that we have defined an event, which we call Super Niño 
(SN), consisting of alternating positive and negative phases and is described by the 
template shown in fig. 2B and fig. 3B. In the sequence, El Niños are indexed with even 
integers and La Niñas with odd integers. The largest El Niño has index 0 and the largest 
La Niña has index +1 The sequence corresponds to the observed El Niño/La Niña 
features in the data. Three such SN's have occurred since 1968 The sequence 0, +1 is 
often noted and has been discussed extensively. The extended sequence [-2, -1, 0, +1, +2, 
+3] is noted for the first time here. 
 
Another major result of this investigation is the construction of a   'Periodic Table' (See 
fig.5), which classifies events according to the sequence indices [-2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3]. 
The table has sequence number horizontally and time vertically. The time axis shows the 
three different SN regions. We show that almost all of the El Niño / La Niña features 

 

4

observed since 1967 are in one of the SN event regions and each SN region shows a 
complete sequence. 
 
The table lists 22 events. Events 1 to 18 (less 8 and 10) are explicitly listed by Trenberth 
(1997) as either an El Niño or as a La Niña, which we have further identified as 
belonging to a particular index. His suggestion that events 4 and 5 are part of one La Niña 
and that 6 and 7 are part of one El Niño agrees with our identification. Events 8 and 10 
found by us are 'too weak' to have been detected by his criteria [magnitude greater than 
0.4 °C for 6 months]. He further groups the 3 positive 'El Niños'( events 15, 16, and 17) 
together [This is called the region 'without La Niñas']. We find that events 15 and 16 lie 
outside of the range of the SN2 and SN3 template and thus must have a different 
explanation Event 17, however is identified by us as an N-2  El Niño event associated 
with SN3. Event 18 is an N-1  La Niña also associated with SN3.  
 
Events 19 and 20 occurred after Trenberth's paper and are the recent El Niño and La 
Niña.  Events 21 and 22 are 'forecasts' of this paper. 
 
One sees that with the exception of events 15 and 16 that all observed events can be 
explained. There are only three Super Niño events hence only 3 type N0  El Niños. All of 
the other El Niños in the list are related to these. For example the El Niño of 1986-88 is 
seen to be of type N2 and is related to the N0 El Niño of 1982-83 because both are phases 
of the SN2 event. Similar statements can be made concerning La Niñas. 
 
Regions (Time Segments) not Accounted for by Super Niño-Events 
 
As noted above, the periods 1950 to 1969 and 1990 to 1994 showed some large features 
comparable to the features explained by SN events. So these events were not considered 
as SN events because of low correlation with the template. What is the explanation of 
these events? There are a number of possibilities. 
1. The amplitude of the fluctuations that initiate a SN is small and the necessary threshold 
is not reached.  
2. Fluctuations in amplitude are large enough but numerous. In this case an event, which 
starts, is soon interrupted by a later event. 
3. Other geophysical effects dominate. 
The calculations in the Appendix for the standard deviation of the annual term prior to 
1968 gave much smaller values for the period 1950 to 1969. This favors explanation 1 for 
this region. However, an analysis the SST residuals given in  table 2 for the SN periods 
shows that the SST amplitude for this period is larger than the amplitude of the residuals. 
This favors explanation 2. We prefer 2 to 1. 
 
We spent considerable time studying the large 91-92 'El Niño'. It can  not be fit into our 
scenario.  It is possible that this is a SN event that got as far as the N-2  sequence  when it 
was interrupted by the stronger SN3. Or explanation 3 may be invoked. We note that this 
particular 'El Niño' has been considered 'anomalous' by other investigators. See Trenberth 
and Hoar (1996).

Hindcasts/Forecasts 
 
As discussed above, the results indicate that the Earth is presently experiencing a SN 
event, which started in the mid 1990's and will continue for another 4-5 years unless 
interrupted. This extrapolation into the future suggests that a minor El Nino will begin in 
mid 2001 and will reach a maximum about a year later. 
 
This 'prediction' is not the main result of our research efforts and we do not feel qualified 
to discuss this in terms that experts in this field use in predicting future climates. 
Nevertheless, it did come out of our research efforts so we show that result. We will let 
others evaluate what we have found using the technical terms of this field such as 'skill'.   
Our template is based upon only the record of the three SN events and the 'forecast' 
portion is based upon only two SN events.  In order to obtain a more accurate template 
one would need many more records to reduce the error.  Our subjective estimate of the 
error is 30-50%. So we would assign errors of this magnitude to the 'forecasts' of SST. 
According to our results, the Earth is presently in the late stages of a La Niña and is due 
to go into an N2 El Niño phase early in 2001. Our 'forecast', however, is different from 
the others shown in fig 4B in that there should be a third negative dip before the zero 
crossing of the curve into the new El Nino region (N2). This should happen in the next 
several months.  We also note that the CCA model seems to suggest that such a dip will 
occur while the other two, Landsea and NCEP, do not.  In addition, Landsea predicts a 
maximum as we do. 
 
Summary 
 
The major results of this investigation are the discovery of the template describing what 
we call the Super Niño (SN) event.  This template is used to construct a "periodic table" 
that allows a classification of most of the maxima and minima in the data.  The template 
also can be used to make forecasts.  In the appendix we suggest a possible model based 
upon parametric resonance. 
 
Addendum 
 
This study was done during the summer of 2000.  The analysis was done using data 
through July of 2000 when this paper was written.  The forecast using the template start 
from that date.  The delay between writing the paper and the final submission has allowed 
11 SST data points to accumulate.  A new figure [Fig. 6] has been added to the 
manuscript showing these 11 points, which can be compared to the forecast that we 
made.  The data show a remarkable mirroring of the forecast through a maximum, a 
minimum, and a zero crossing.  If the data follow the curve into the predicted small El 
Niño in late 2001 then one must consider that this scenario has some validity.

Appendix: Nature of the Super Niño-Event 
 
The analysis in the body of the text is empirical and stands by itself with no attempt to 
relate the results to any model.  In this appendix we discuss models and mechanisms.  
Whatever the process is, it must be the same for every event and explain both the 
beginning and end of the template. 
General Observations  

1) The events are independent from each other. 
2) Since 1968, only three have occurred. 
3) There are periods of time that are not explained by SN events: prior to 1968 
and from 1990-1994 

 
As a function of time one can say: 

 
4) At a time prior to the time of the maximum of the template something begins 
exciting the ENSO system. 
5) At a time prior to the maximum, the amplitude is increasing. 
6) The time of the maximum is not the beginning of the SN event. 
7) After the maximum amplitude has occurred, the amplitude decreases with time.  
8) The event can be divided into two parts: 

(1) before the maximum: the excitation phase  
(2) after the maximum: the decay phase. 
 

With this observation the maximum is thus the end of the   excitation phase and the 
beginning of the decay phase. 
 

9) The duration of the event is greater than 15 years. 

 
Assumptions 
We make the following assumptions about the SN in order to attempt an explanation of 
these observations. 
 

10) The state of the ENSO system in the absence of noise is zero before and after 
a Super Niño-Event. 
11) The ENSO system has normal modes, which have specific 
frequencies/periods. Even though one may not know what they are, they are fixed.  
12) That something excites one [or several] of these normal modes, which puts 
the ENSO system in a state in which the amplitude is larger than the 'noise'. 
13) The maximum is achieved when the excitation ceases [Or as suggested below, 
the excitation ceases when the maximum is reached]. 
14) The amplitude of the normal modes will decay after excitation because of 
dissipative processes. 
 

 

7

Decay Phase 
The decay phase is simpler to characterize than the excitation phase so we consider it 
first. Implicit is that we are concerned with the properties of the state of the system and 
not with the source of the excitation or the coupling. So the expectation that this part of 
the template is the same for all SN's is reasonable. Since the excitation is 'off' then one 
observes the 'impulse response' of the ENSO system. One of the simplest impulse 
responses is free decay at a frequency/period[s] of the normal mode[s]. From the template 
curve of fig. 3B one can infer 
 

D1. A normal mode[s] of period[s]  ~ 45-50 months.  
D2. A relaxation time  ~ 60-70 months. 
D3. A high frequency mode coupled to the 45-50 months mode. 
  

The Fourier spectrum of the template has been computed and shows peaks consistent 
with these two periods. 
 
Excitation Phase 
The excitation phase is harder to characterize. One needs: 
 

15) A source of the excitation, which must contain frequencies related to the 
normal frequencies of the system that are observed to have been excited. 
16) A mechanism to couple the source to the normal modes. 
17) Sameness. Whatever accounts for 15) and 16) must be the same each time a 
SN event occurs if there is only one universal template. 
  

Before continuing, it is important to note that there is a possible source of excitation 
present; namely, the strong forced annual oscillation, which is observed in the SST data. 
[Most discussions of SST are about the anomalies in SST data measured from a baseline 
that is defined by each month having its own average, which removes the annual and 
harmonic terms The base line values are different for each month; the largest values 
occur in Nov-Dec-Jan and the smallest in Apr-May-Jun. We will refer below to the plot 
of these values as the annual curve.]. Many investigators are probably unaware of this. 
This annual forcing term cannot satisfy requirement 15) directly because the frequency  
(period =12 months) is higher than the frequencies of the normal modes of this system 
(period = 45-50 months). However, one can couple the annual forcing to the normal 
modes if there are non-linearities in the system. 
 
Excitation Scenario 
Here we consider a possible excitation scenario involving parametric resonance based 
upon an example from Landau and Lifshitz (1960). This scenario not only can explain the 
observations but also predicts properties not contained in the description of the template.  
Landau and Lifshitz consider the case of a damped resonant system with non-linearities 
which is being driven at a frequency fd that is about 3 times the resonant frequency fN. 
The solution has the following properties: 
 

 

8

LL1.   The response of the system is phase-locked to fd [period=12 months] but is 
at fd/3 [period=36 months]. 
LL2.   The frequency fd/3 must be close to, but greater than fN. 
LL3.   There is a minimum amplitude of the driving force [annual term] that is 
necessary in order to excite the system. In Landau and Lifshitz's words: " an 
initial 'push' is necessary in order to excite oscillations".  
LL4.   There is a maximum amplitude beyond which excitation of the system is 
not possible. 
LL5.   If the above conditions are not met, there are no solutions; the amplitude 
of the system at frequency fd/3 is 0 even if the driving force at fd is not. 
 

We compare the properties of the Super Niño-Event to the above list. 
 

LL1'.   The template appears to show one cycle of oscillation at the required 
period of 36 months during the excitation phase.  
LL2'.   The period during excitation [36 months] is less than the normal period 
[45-50 months] as required. 
LL3'.   A threshold amplitude is required in order to initiate an event. Therefore, 
one would expect events to occur less frequently or not at all when the amplitude 
of the annual effect is small. We have calculated the standard deviation of the 
amplitude of the annual term [defined above] for different time intervals and find 
the results listed in table 3. 
LL4'.  Maximum amplitude. The excitation once started would cause the 
amplitude to grow. If the excitation starts in Nov-Dec, then 36 months later in 
Nov-Dec the amplitude would be large. If this amplitude at that time exceeded the 
maximum value allowed then phase locking is lost The system is no longer 
coupled to the driving excitation even though it is still present. This accounts for 
the maximum occurring in those months. The system now enters the decay phase 
and the amplitude of the mode will now decay at the frequency fN of the normal 
mode. 

 
One sees two fascinating results in the table: 
 

(1) The amplitude of the standard deviation is lower during 1950-1968 where we 
have found no Super Niños than during 1968-1999 where we found three. 
(2) The second result is even more interesting. The standard deviation is seen to 
have a large variation during the calendar year. The largest value occurs in Nov-
Dec. This means that the minimum threshold requirement would most likely be 
satisfied in Nov-Dec. Thus, not only is the system phase locked in frequency to 
the annual driving term, it most likely to be excited in Nov-Dec. 

 
To summarize this possible event scenario (ES): 
 

ES1. The excitation of ENSO begins when a fluctuation in the amplitude of the 
annual driving force exceeds a certain threshold (Probably in Nov-Dec).  

 

9

ES2.  The ENSO system is then phase-locked to the annual driving force and 
responds at a period of 36 months. 
ES2. The magnitude of amplitude builds until it reaches the maximum value 
allowed and coupling to the annual effect is not possible. This maximum may 
occur 36 months after ES1 (again in Nov-Dec). The observed maximum SST 
anomaly amplitude of 2.8 °C may be, in fact, this maximum allowed amplitude. 
[i.e. No larger El Niño events than have already been observed will occur!]   
ES4. The decoupled ENSO system then decays freely at period[s] 45-50 months 
with decay constant ~60 months [and exchanging energy with a coupled higher 
frequency mode]. 
   

 
The scenario in this appendix seems to not only to be consistent with the properties of the 
template; it predicts three new effects that are not a property of the template: minimum 
threshold amplitude, Nov-Dec phase, and a maximum amplitude, all of which are 
suggested by the data. 
 
There is an extensive body of literature on ENSO models.  Neelin et al. (1998) and 
Baraston et al. (1999) have summarized the various models of ENSO that have been 
considered.  The models are grouped into two classes: dynamical and statistical.  
Although this template was found by statistical analysis the model presented in this 
appendix is definitely not in the statistical class.  The papers of Zebiak and Cane (1987), 
Barnett et al. (1993), Kirtman et al. (1997), and Ji et al. (1996) are among those of the 
dynamic class. All of them are coupled models involving the atmosphere and the ocean.  
The Landau - Lifshitz (LL) model considered implies coupling because neither the ocean 
or the atmosphere has normal frequencies needed to explain the template.  Some of these 
dynamical models have feedback but there is none here.  Also one can say that this LL 
model is not a delayed oscillator model.  In many of these models the driving force is 
unclear.  In our scheme the driving force originates from the annual effect and the 
frequency is known and the mechanism is via parametric resonance.  Our alternative 
scheme outlined above is not the same as any of these models. 
 
This scenario is perhaps improbable in part or in total. However, even if wrong, it proves 
that the set of scenarios is not empty. There are undoubtedly many other excitation 
scenarios that one could invent but they would have to explain all of the details that we 
have noted. A challenge to this or any other plausible scenario is to understand the 
driving force and measured template evolution from the actual geophysical dynamics and 
climate physics.

Shows Niño region 3.4 where the SST measurements are made and the SOI 
stations at Tahiti and Darwin where the pressure difference measurements are 
made. 

 
Fig. 2. Climate Index data and Super Niño-Event 

(A) Sea Surface Temperature anomalies (SST) and  
Southern Oscillation Index Anomalies vs. date. 

(B) Schematic of Super Niño-Event. The region labeled 
N0 is what is called El Niño and the region labeled N1 is what is called La Niña. 
The other labeled regions are features of the Super Niño-Event but have not been 
previously recognized.

(A) Stacking of the three SST Super Niño-Events. These events have their 
maximum at Nov 72; Jan 83; and Nov 97. 
(B) Template derived from the stacking plots. The SST template from the 3 
curves in (A). 
 

Fig. 4. SST Data and Various Hindcasts/Forecasts 

(A)  Data, Comparison, Residuals. 1968 to 2004.The 3 Super Niño regions are 
indicated. Also shown is the not explained region 1990-1994. 
(B)Same as A but for 1994-2004. Here the SST data is not averaged. Various 
forecasts beyond the present (July 2000) are also shown. 

 
Fig. 5. El Niño and La Niña 'Periodic Table' 
 
The El Niños and La Niñas since Sept 1968 are arranged into a "Periodic Table". A main 
result of this paper is that an event, which we call a Super Niño (SN) sometime, occurs 
consisting of alternating El Niños and La Niñas phases in a sequence [-2, -1,0, +1, +2, 
+3] given by the template described in this paper. Three such SN's have occurred during 
this interval of time accounting for most of the features observed in the data. El Niños are 
indexed with even integers with 0 corresponding to the largest and the one most often 
noted. La Niñas have odd indices with +1 being associated with the most often cited case. 
The sequence 0, +1 is often noted; the rest of the sequence is noted for the first time in 
this paper. 
There are 22 such El Niño/ La Niña features addressed in this table. Features 1 to 18 (less 
8 and 10) are explicitly identified by Trenberth [1] as either an El Niño or as a La Niña. 
His suggestion that 4 and 5 are part of one La Niña and that 6 and 7 are part of one El 
Niño is correct according to our scheme. The events 8 and 10 that have been found by us 
are 'too weak' to have been detected by Trenberth's criteria. We find that his positive 
features 15 and 16 do not fit our scheme; These are discussed in the text. Events 19 and 
20 occurred after Trenberth's paper. Events 21 and 22 are forecasts of this paper

Fig. 6.  The delay between writing the paper and the final submission has allowed 11 SST 
data points to accumulate.  This figure has been added to the manuscript showing these 
11 points, which can be compared to the forecast that we made.  The data show a 
remarkable mirroring of the forecast through a maximum, a minimum, and a zero 
crossing.  If the data follow the curve into the predicted small El Niño in late 2001 then 
one must consider that this scenario has some validity. 
 
 
Table Captions 
 
Table 1.  

List of El Niño/ La Niña Events. Trenberth[1] gave an operational criterion of an 

event. An event occurs when the SST signal for region 3.4 exceeds 0.4 C and lasted for 5 
months. Events 1 though 18 (less 8, 10) were generated by this criterion and are from his 
table 2. The La Niñas Events 8 and 10 found by us are too weak to have been identified 
by the Trenberth criterion. Trenberth couples the La Niña Events 4,5 and also the El Niño 
events 6,7 and 15,16,17. These events are discussed in the text. Events after 18 occurred 
after the last event in the list in the Trenberth paper and are discussed in the text also.

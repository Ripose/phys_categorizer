Abstract. Three related topics are discussed to show the “simplicity, harmony and 
beauty” of the theory of special relativity (SR): (1) How can de’ Broglie discover his 
famous relation between the particle’s momentum and a wave length--- a paradox 
stemming from the time dilatation effect of SR. (2) The relativistic Doppler effect, 
especially the distinction between the transverse Doppler effect and the time dilatation 
effect. (3) Three particular exa mples are examined to derive the general mass-energy 
relation in SR by induction method.

INTRODUCTION 

 

 

The theory of special relativity (SR) established by Einstein in 1905 and the theory of 
quantum mechanics (QM) are two great pillars of the whole framework of modern 
physics. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize SR being the direct promoter of QM 
(section II) and discuss three elegant examples (sections V, VI and the Appendix) to 
show the power of the principle of relativity in SR as well as the essence of induction 
method. Section III is a simple review of relativistic Doppler effect because it is 
intimately related to sections V, VI and there is some confusion in textbooks about the 
distinction between the time dilatation effect and the transverse Doppler effect (section 
IV). The final section VII contains a summary and discussion. Although there is 
essentially nothing new in this paper, which might still be useful as a reference in 
teaching SR. 
 

II. 

DE’BROGLIE’S PARADOX AND ITS SOLUTION    

 

 

ph=l

As is well known, QM, especially its form invented by Schrödinger, was initiated from 
the seminal work by de’Broglie in 1923. An equation named after him is taught in every 
course of QM: 
 
 
where  l
 is the wave length of  “de’Broglie wave” associated with a particle having 
momentum p and h is the Planck constant. However, one thing needs to be stressed is 
how could de’Broglie discover Eq. (2.1)? To relate a wave to a particle was an absurd 
idea at that time. How could he reach this idea? 
  The clue lies in a paradox raised by him. First, a famous relation was already proposed 
by Einstein in 1905 to explain the photo-electric effect: 
 

E = h f  

(2.2) 

(2.1) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Where E is the energy of a “photon” with f  being the frequenc y of associated 
electromagnetic wave.  Eq. (2.2) also seemed absurd in 1905 because in classical 
electrodynamics the energy of wave should be directly proportional to its amplitude 
square rather than frequency. As Einstein’s relation (2.2) had been tested  in numerous 
experiments, de’Broglie boldly assumed that it might be also valid for a particle like 
electron. It means that there might be some vibration associated with an electron and its 
frequency f is proportional to the electron’s energy E: 

om (v) is the rest mass (velocity) of electron while c is the speed of light. When  

 

 

E

where 
v = 0, (2.3) reads: 
 
hf =

    As a next conjecture, he might think that the vibration is belong to an “inner clock” 
moving with the electron as often discussed in the theory of SR. However, as is well 
known in SR, if the clock has a frequency 
would slow down to  1f  when it is moving at a velocity v:

Evidently, the so-called time dilatation effect (2.6) is just opposite to Eq. (2.5). Hence 
we may name the contradiction between them a “ de’Broglie’s paradox”. 
  There are a number of paradoxes in physics, aiming at pushing the contradiction of 
theory into such an acute situation so that one can find what was wrong in the old concept 
and/or what new ingredient was missing in the old theory. What de’Broglie eventually 
1f  are two different things: While  1f  is the frequency of an “inner 
realized is that f and 
clock” moving with the electron and an observer( staying in the laboratory (L) frame) 
must arrange his apparatus moving at a same velocity before  1f  can be measured,  the f  
should be another frequency of a “wave’ associated with the particle. To measure f of a 
wave, the observer keeps measuring its vibration frequency at a fixed point in the L frame. 
As the conditions of measurement are different, the difference between f and  1f  should be 
understandable. There is no contradiction at all.  
As a third step, de’Broglie resorted to the whole theory of SR in two inertial frames, the 
rest frame of electron and the L frame. With  the bold hypothesis (2.1) as the wavelength 
of his “wave”, he was capable of making the whole theory self-consistent.Actually, one 
more assumption ( called by de’Broglie as the “phase harmony law” and regarded by 
himself as the most fundamental contribution all his life[1]) was used, saying that the 
phase of “wave“ is an invariant of the Lorentz transformation. 
 In some sense, de’Broglie discovered the half of quantum theory, Eq. (2.1), from 
another half, Eq.(2.2), by means of the whole theory of SR. His genius thinking really 
won a great success in the history of physics. 

-
  However, the de’Broglie wave (later developed into “wave function” in general by 
Schrödinger) is not observable. How can we measure f and 
next section.

emits light with frequency

IV.  EXPERIMENTAL VERIFICATION OF RELATIVISTIC 

DOPPLER EFFECT AND GRATITATIONAL REDSHIFT 

 
The relativistic Doppler effect was proposed by Einstein in 1907 and first confirmed by 
the experiment of Ives and Stilwell in 1938[3]( see also [2,4]). Then two experiments 
were conducted  by MacArthur et al. in 1986[5] and by McGowan et al. in 1993[6] 
respectively. Both of them used the mutual interaction between laser beam and atom 
beam and so achieved high accuracy in the verification of Eq. (3.4). While in 
MacArthur’s experiment with  b
 in both 
to
papers [5] and [6] is that between the laser beam and atom beam directions, so their q
 is 
precisely that in Eq. (3.4), an angle that can only be measured in the laboratory. In fact, 
the angle 
source, is very difficult (even impossible) to measure in their experiments.

   However, there is another kind of experiment , first realized by Hay et al. in 1960[7] 
and by
in 1963[8] (see discussion by Sherwin[9]). They predicted that if using a 
rotating system with angular velocity  w and putting the (light or  g ) source (S) near the 
center, the absorber(A) at the rim of rotator with radius 
change: 

AR will detect a fractional energy

AE and 

SE  are the characteristic energies of the absorber and the source. 

where 
In Eq. (4.1), there are two different modes to explain the same effect: one is resorting to 
=
SR----the absorber is moving at a speed 
“inner clock” (or atom) is vibrating at a slower frequency as shown by Eq. (2.6). Notice 
also that the photon is received by the absorber along the radius direction perpendicular 
to the direction of absorber’s motion, i.e., 
in Eq. (3.4). Hence the relativistic 
Doppler effect in Eq. (4.1) (which was often called the “transverse Doppler effect” in 
some literatures and text books, but we prefer to refer it being the time dilatation effect) 
exhibits itself as a decreasing of frequency.  Another explanation of Eq. (4.1) is resorting 
to the theory of general relativity (GR): the frame K attached to the rotating absorber is 
an accelerating one, the principle of equivalence in GR interpret the centrifugal force 
acting on the absorber as a gravitational force with the potential  

in the laboratory. So its

(4.2) 

Thus the observer in K will assert that his clock is slowed down by the gravitational 
potential, i.e., the characteristic frequency  Af of incident light  measured in K frame is 
lower than   Sf  associated with the source where the gravitational potential is higher than 
that at absorber shown by Eq. (4.2):

V.  DERIVATION OF MASS-ENERGY RELATION VIA A 

RESONANT ABSORPTION PROCESS

In his second paper for establishing SR in 1905, Einstein proposed the greatest equation 
changing the world: 
 
 
E =
To derive it, Einstein had resorted to an  ideal experiment, considering the interaction  
between electromagnetic wave with matter.(see also [2],p.16). However, many text books 
on SR often devote a great effort to discuss the process of elastic (or inelastic) collision 
between two particles for deriving (5.1) and the velocity dependence of m:

 It seems to us that once the derivation is not simple enough, it might obscure to some 
extent the main essence of the induction method, which is needed to establish a law like 
(5.1) with (5.2). Let us try to find a simple way of presentation which may be nearer to 
the original idea of Einstein. 
 First of all, we should note that the establishment of (5.1) with (5.2) is essentially a 
conjecture, i.e., a guess work of induction method----   we guess first a possible relation 
between the rest energy 

oE   and the rest mass 

om  of a particle as: 

E =

Then if it is moving at a velocity v, its kinetic energy

om ) absorbing resonantly a photon (with frequency f ) because we already know 

where …. means the possible corrections at high speed. To Einstein, Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2) 
could be guessed quite naturally.  The next crucial step is to find an example for checking 
them rigorously. 
Let us following Einstein, just consider a simple process of a rest particle (with rest 
mass 
that a photon has energy hf  and mo mentum hf/c in the laboratory(S) frame. We will 
assume Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2) to see if the conservation laws hold in both S frame and S’ 
frame in which the particle after absorbing the photon is at rest with rest mass 
 Denoting the velocity of particle after absorbing the photon in the S frame by v, and the 
frequency of photon in the S’ frame by 
conservation laws in the S frame as:

Now we have four equations containing three unknown quantities v, 
om and f being given). If we can solve them consistently, we can then claim the validity 
of Eqs (5.1) with (5.2).  To see this, we first solve from (5.3) and (5.5) that ( b

ocm  as shown in (5.7). All four equations match 

 
which is exactly the longitudinal Doppler effect (3.10) . The final crucial step is 
substituting them altogether to Eq. (5.6) to see if it is valid. Then it turns to be just right--
- both sides have the same value 
perfectly, the proof is finished. It means the validity of Eqs. (5.1) with (5.2) as well as the 
basic postulate of SR-----the principle of relativity does hold for two inertial frames. 
However, we should notice that being a law, (5.1) with (5.2) has to be verified eventually 
by experiments. The above derivation merely shows the essence of induction method ----
from particular ( the process of particle absorbing a photon) to general ( the validity of 
(5.1) and (5.2) in two inertial frames) . So the number of unknown variables must be less 
than that of equations. This is not a method of deduction-----from general (well-
established theory) to particular------where the number of unknown variables should be 
equal to that of equations in one inertial frame so that we can get a particular solution 
unambiguously. In short, what we need to find from an induction method is a general law, 
not a particular solution. So the validity of law should be ensured by more and more 
particular experiments. To this purpose, we shall consider two more examples in the next 
section and the Appendix. 
 

VI.  ANNIHILATION RADIATION OF A POSITRONIUM 

 
Similar to a hydrogenlike atom, a positronium is a bound state of electron and positron. It 
is unstable against decay to two photons with lifetime

transverse Doppler effect as discussed in Eq. (3.9) because now the photon is emitted 
o
along a direction perpendicular to positronium’s velocity v in its rest frame [
Eq. (3.6)] . By the way, if an observer moves at a velocity along one of these two photons, 
he will see the longitudinal Doppler effect as shown by Eq. (3.10).

VII.  SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION 

(a) SR is the direct promoter of QM not only because SR promoted the discovery of 
de’Broglie wave which led further to the invention of Schrödinger equation, but  
also because Einstein’s idea directly promoted the invention of QM by 
Heisenberg along another route complementary to that of de’Broglie and 
Schrödinger, see [10]. 

(b) The Doppler effect is an effect of frequency change 

velocity v between the source and the observer.  While

 in SR. 
in classical physics, it is further modified to the second order 
Although various relativistic Doppler effects are stemming from the common 
essence of SR, we should be careful not to confuse the time dilatation effect (3.8)

with the transverse Doppler effect (3.9) because their conditions in measurement 
are different. On the other hand, the gravitational redshift (GRS) is the frequency 
change due to the existence of gravitational field ,i.e., due to the relative 
acceleration between the source and the observer. Interesting enough, in 
experiments on the rotator, once GRS is taken into account, the second order 
Doppler effect in SR should not be doubly counted. 

(c)  To derive the Einstein Eq. (5.1) with (5.2) by induction method, we present two 

examples in sections V and VI as well as another one in the Appendix. In all three 
cases, we must consider two inertial frames simultaneously so that the number of 
equations exceeds that of  unknown variables. Thereby each case poses a test on 
the general validity of (5.1) with (5.2) as well as the principle of relativity.  

(d)  The example in section V provides the strongest proof because once a photon---a 
totally relativistic object---- is coexisting with the particle ( before absorption), the 
principle of relativity—both momentum and energy conservation laws hold 
rigorously in two inertial frames ----- poses so stringent a constraint that other 
possibility except (5.1) and (5.2) is definitely exc luded. The example in section 
VI seems a little weaker because the uniqueness of (5.1) with (5.2) is ensured by 
the validity of relativistic Doppler effect (6.7) and (3.10) (which must be derived 
from the Lorentz transformation.) of two photons after decay. The example in the 
Appendix seems even weaker because its unambiguous conclusion (5.1) with (5.2) 
must be ensured by the velocity addition law of Lorentz transformation (A.11) 
explicitly. Otherwise, one can always discuss the collision between two particles 
in the realm of classical mechanics (where mass and energy are two unrelated 
things) without violating the principle of relativity in the sense of Galilean 
transformation. 

(e) Nevertheless, all topics discussed in this paper are capable of reflecting the 

“simplicity, harmony and beauty” of SR to some extent.

PARTICLES 

 APPENDIX. INELASTIC COLLISION BETWEEN TWO IDENTICAL 

 
As a further check of Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2), let us discuss a simplest example of two 

identical particles each with a rest mass

om , colliding in a completely inelastic manner so 

oM . Again, we consider two inertial 
that they form a compound particle with rest mass
frames: In S frame, the first particle having a velocity u collides with the second one at 
rest, then after collision, the particle 
oM is 
at rest, so before collision, two particles have velocities v and – v. 

oM  has a velocity v.  In another S’ frame, the

Hence the momentum and energy conservation laws in the S frame read:

As a whole, we have three equations but only two unknown variables 

oM and v (with 

om and u being given). In SR, the following notations are proved to be very useful:

 Now it is a pleasure to find consistently the solution of these three equations as: 

Eqs.(A.8) and (A.9) are rigorous solution to the above relativistic dynamical problem 

in the whole range (0,c) of u , corresponding to u

ranging from 0 to infinity. 
m2M =

In the nonrelativistic limit (u<<c), we have v = u /2 and 
However, we should note that the velocity v can be expressed in terms of u as [2]: 

as expected.

Indeed, setting u’ = v in (A.11), we get (A.10) immediately.

Abstract 

The  bulk  displacement  damage  in  the  detector,  produces  effects  at  the  device  level  that  limits  the  long  time  utilisation  of  
detectors  as  position  sensitive  devices  and  thus  the  lifetime  of  detector  systems.  So,  the  prediction  of  time  behaviour  of 
detectors in hostile radiation environments represents a very useful tool. In this contribution we predict the time degradation 
of silicon detectors in the radiation environments expected in the LHC machine upgrade in luminosity and energy as SLHC, 
for detectors fabricated from silicon crystals obtained by different growth technologies, in the frame of the model developed 
by the authors, and which takes into account the contribution of primary defects.  

Keywords: silicon detectors; hadrons; leptons; radiation damage; primary defects; kinetics of defects.

long  history.  A  vast  amount  of  data  was  collected 
trying  to  understand  the  principal  mechanisms  by 
which  the  detector  performances  change  during 
irradiation  and  deteriorate  the  optimised  device 
parameters.  The  main  operational  parameters  that 
degrade  detection  characteristics  of  the  device  are: 
the  full  depletion  voltage  Vdep,  the  leakage  current

impurities 

and  the  charge  collection  efficiency  (CCE).  These 
changes are due to bulk displacement damage in the 
lattice, which produces primary point defects, which, 
during annealing processes, interact between them or 
with 
defects. 
Consequently,  an  increase  of  the  leakage  current  in 
the  detector  is  produced,  a  decrease  of  the  initially 
satisfactory Signal/Noise ratio, and an increase of the 
effective  carrier  concentration  (and  thus  of  the 
depletion  voltage),  which  ultimately  increases  the 
operational  voltage  of 
the 
breakdown voltage.

new 

In  silicon  detectors,  the  increase  of  the  leakage 
current  during  and  after  irradiation  is  due  to  the 
generation of electron-hole pairs on the energy levels 
of the produced defects, an important contribution to 
the leakage current having those with energy levels in 
the  vicinity  of  the  mid-gap,  and  with  high  cross 
sections for carrier capture. It has been calculated in 
agreement with the Shockley – Read - Hall model. In 
the field region, the occupancy of the energy levels is 
determined  by  the  balance  of  trapping  and  emission 
of charge carriers. The effective carrier concentration, 
Neff  represents  the  absolute  value  of  the  difference 
between ionised donors and acceptors. 

2. The model for silicon degradation 

The  model  of  kinetics  of  defects  used  in  the 
present  work  has  been  developed  previous  by  the 
authors,  see  for  example  [1]  and  references  cited 
therein.  It  describes,  at  the  microscopic  level,  the 
formation  and  evolution  of  defects  in  silicon  during 
and after irradiation and correlates these effects with 
the macroscopic parameters of the device.  

The 

interacts  with 

incident  particle 

the 
semiconductor  material.  The  peculiarities  of  the 
interaction  mechanisms  are  explicitly  considered  for 
each  type  of  particle  and  kinetic  energy.  When  an 
incident  particle  is  slowed  down  in  silicon,  it 
produces different types of damage. While ionisation 
is  the  basis  of  particle  detection  and  is  reversible, 
displacement  effects  produce  defects  in  the  lattice  – 
which are of interest for this analysis. The processes 
by  which  the  recoil  nuclei  resulting  from  these 
interactions  lose  their  energy  in  the  semiconductor 
lattice  are  modelled.  The  kinetic  energy  dependence 

the  formation  and 

of  the  concentration  of  primary  defects  on  unit 
particle fluence (CPD) is calculated for each incident 
particle and energy, and it is used in the evaluation of 
the  generation  rate  of  defects  during  irradiation  in 
accord  with  Lindhard  theory.  In  the  next  step  is 
modelled 
time  evolution  of 
complex defects, associations of primary defects or of 
primary  defects  and  impurities.  The  primary  point 
defects  considered  here  are  vacancies  (as  “classic” 
vacancies  and  fourfold  coordinated  vacancy  defects: 
SiFFCD)  and  silicon  self  interstitials.  In  what  regards 
the  SiFFCD  defect,  its  existence  was  predicted  by 
Goedecker and co-workers [2] and its characteristics 
were  indirectly  established  by  Lazanu  and  Lazanu 
[3].  We  established  that  this  defect  is  produced 
simultaneously  with  the  “classic”  vacancy,  with  a 
concentration of about 10% from all vacancies per act 
of  interaction,  is  stable  in  time,  it  is  uniformly 
introduced in the bulk during irradiation and has deep 
energy  level(s)  in  the  gap,  at  least  one  energy  level 
between  Ec  –  (0.46 ÷  0.48)  eV.  The  primary  defects 
are introduced with a rate that is sum of contributions 
from 
and  generation  by 
irradiation. 

thermal  generation 

In  the  forthcoming  analysis,  only  phosphorus, 
carbon and oxygen impurities are considered as pre-
existent  in  silicon.  The  kinetics  of  defects  was 
modelled  applying  the  theory  of  diffusion-limited 
reactions.  The  complete  reaction  scheme  for  the 
formation and evolution of defects could be found in 
reference 
time  evolution  of  defect 
concentrations  for  primary  and  complex  defects 
produced  in  silicon  is  the  solution  of  the  associated 
system of simultaneous differential equations, which 
do not have an analytic solution. The model is able to 
calculate, without free parameters, absolute values of 
microscopic and macroscopic quantities.

3. Predictions of the behaviour of detectors in 
radiation fields 

The  comparison  of  model  calculation  with 
experimental  data  at  the  macroscopic  level  has  been 
performed. In this respect, three classes of results will 
be discussed here: a) related to the time evolution of 
macroscopic  characteristics  of  detectors  after 
irradiation,  b)  the  fluence  dependence  of  these

characteristics for different technologies used, and c) 
predictions  of  detector  behaviour  in  continuous 
irradiations regime as expected to SLHC for FZ and 
DOFZ technologies for silicon detectors.  

a) The modifications induced by irradiation in the 
leakage current and effective carrier concentration of 
silicon detectors have been previously calculated and 
compared  with  available  experimental  data  on 
irradiation  with 
detector 
electrons,  protons,  positive  and  negative  pions,  and 
neutrons  (see  Ref.  [3]).  A  good  agreement  between 
model  calculations  and  experimental  data  has  been 
obtained.

obtained.

restricted  only  to  the  beginning  of  irradiation,  i.e.  to

For high resistivity silicon (2 kWcm and 15 kWcm 
respectively)  irradiated  with  24  GeV/c  protons,  a 
good  agreement  between  model  calculations  and 
experimental  data  from  Ref.  [4]  is  obtained  both  for 
FZ and DOFZ material, as could be seen in Figure 2. 
These results show that the degradation at the highest 
fluences  studied  here  is  not  clearly  correlated  with 
oxygen concentration in silicon or with the resistivity 
of  the  starting  material.  Consequently,  for  high 
fluences, it is not possible to make a choice between 
FZ and DOFZ materials.

Following the idea exposed by F. Gianotti in Ref. [5], 
we supposed the following conditions for the collider 
upgrade: the luminosity is increased with an factor of 
ten in report with LHC, the beam energy is increased 
with a factor of two, and the energetic distributions of 
pions  and  protons  are 
the  same  as  for  LHC 
conditions, but with the average energy of the spectra 
shifted  to  higher  energy  with  50  MeV.  In  the  LHC 
conditions  (considering  for  the  concrete  discussions 
the particular case of the CMS experiment), after the 
primary  interaction,  hadrons  are  the  predominant 
particles in the tracker, especially low energy charged 
pions  and  protons.  The  maximum  in  the  rates  of 
primary  defects  generated  by  pions  comes  from  the 
region around 200 MeV while for protons the major 
contribution  comes  from  the  lowest  energy  region. 
The rates of generation of defects (induced by pions 
and  protons)  are:  6.8  x  108  VI/cm3/s  in  the  LHC 
conditions  and  7.2  x  109  VI/cm3/s  for  SLHC 
hypothesis.  The  contributions  coming  from  proton 
spectra represent about 8 % from all primary defects. 
The  behaviour  of  FZ  and  DOFZ  silicon  detectors 
in  the  fields  estimated  for  LHC  and  SLHC  is 
presented  as  time  dependence  of  the  density  of 
leakage current and as effective carrier concentration, 
in conditions of continuous irradiation – see Figure 3. 
For leakage currents, the differences between DOFZ 
and FZ silicon are very small and could be observed 
especially  for  LHC  rates  in  the  first  months  of 
operation,  where  DOFZ  silicon  seems  radiation 
harder.

As  in  the  previous  case,  one  could  see  that  the 
benefits  of  oxygenation  are  lost,  and  roughly  the 
same  results  are  estimated  for  both  materials,  the 
 

effects  being  correlated  with  the  luminosity  and  not 
with the characteristics of particle spectra.

the  main

In  the  scenarios  for  radiation  environments  at

scales with luminosity, and is roughly independent on 
particle  spectra.  In  these  conditions,  there  are  no 
significant  differences  between  FZ  and  DOFZ

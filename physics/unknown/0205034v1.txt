       A method of determining boundary conditions for quasi 1-D modeling of steady-state operation of a Hall Thruster 
with ceramic channel is presented. For a given mass flow rate and magnetic field profile the imposed condition of a 
smooth  sonic  transition  uniquely  determines  plasma  density  at  the  anode.  The  discharge  voltage  determines  the 
structure of the anode sheath and thus determines electron and ion velocities at the anode. These parameters appear to 
be  sufficient  for  constructing  a  solution  with  given  temperature  profile.  It  is  shown  that  a  good  correlation  between 
simulated  and  experimental  results  can  be  achieved  by  selecting  an  appropriate  electron  mobility  and  temperature 
profile. The structure of the electrode sheath was studied theoretically over a wide range of input parameters, such as 
discharge  voltage,  incoming  neutral  velocity  and  channel  length,  and  the  possibility  of  realization  of  the  no-sheath 
operating regime is discussed here. 
 

PROBLEM SETUP 
 

Consider the conventional case of a HT with ceramic channel. The input parameters for any model of 
dV ,  the  propellant 

the  HT  are  the  experimentally  controlled  parameters,  namely,  the  discharge  voltage, 

dm
dt

mass  flow  rate, 

,  and  the  radial  magnetic  field  profile, 

. We neglect the influence of the axial 

)(zBr

component of the magnetic field. The output parameters to be determined are the discharge current,  dI
propellant utilization, and the profiles of ion velocity, ion density and potential.  

, the 

To describe a steady-state operation of a Hall Thruster we consider the following physical processes. 
Single  ionization:  ions  are  born  with  the  neutral  velocity;  wall  losses:  averaged  over  the  channel  cross-
section; ion acceleration: toward the cathode, use hydrodynamic momentum equation for a mono-energetic 
ion flow with the ion velocity 
 direction; electron diffusion: 
eV ;  free  neutral  motion:  assume  the  mono-energetic 
toward  the  anode,  with  the  electron  flow  velocity 
neutral  flow  with  the  constant  neutral  velocity 
0aV .  We  also  make  a  quasineutrality  assumption:

Let us note that in most of our numerical simulations we used input parameters typical for the PPPL

In a 1-D description of a problem it is also necessary to select a distance from the anode,

The equation (8) describes the ion dynamics in quasineutral plasma. A similar equation describes the 
flow  dynamics  in  the  well-known  de  Laval  nozzle.6  The  first  (positive)  term  in  the  numerator  of  (8) 
originates  from  the  ionization  term  in  (1)  and  leads  to  ion  acceleration  in  the  subsonic  region  of  the  ion 
. The second (negative) term in the numerator of (8) is originally the electric field 
flow, i.e. where 
term from the equation (2), and it effectively works in subsonic plasma as an ion drag. The denominator 
appears  essentially  because  of  the  electron  pressure  and  it  turns  to  zero  at  the  boundary  of  the  subsonic 
flow,  at  which  M=1.  This  leads  to  a  singularity,  typical  for  quasineutral  plasmas  and  called  the  “sonic 
transition”.6 We look only for a non-singular solution of our system which describes a smooth behavior of

Fruchtman  and  Fisch  in  Ref.  [7]  considered  the  possibility  of  abrupt  sonic  transition  in  HT  with  an 
additional electrode placed inside the channel, and Ahedo et al in Ref. [8] proposed a “choked-exit” type of 
solution,  in  which  ions  reach  the  sound  velocity  right  at  the  channel  exit.  However,  all  of  the  authors 
considered a smooth sonic transition in their models of the conventional Hall Thrusters.

SOLUTION 

We  used  the  above  boundary  conditions  to  determine  free  parameters  and  obtain  a  solution  with 
several constant temperatures. It appeared that, like in some other models,7 at large temperatures all of the 
propellant is ionized in a very short region near the anode, and if we choose smaller temperatures, we get 

the propellant utilization,

smaller  than  a  certain  lower  threshold,  ionization  appears  to  be  insufficient  for  normal  operation  of  the 
thruster  and  it  becomes  impossible  to  build  a  non-singular  solution  with  supersonic  ion  velocity  at  the 
thruster exit with any free parameters.  

However,  we  showed  that the same approach to determining free parameters can be applied and the 
solution can be constructed in the case of any given shape of temperature profile, qualitatively similar to 
experimental,5  if  maximal  temperature,  maxT
,  is  chosen  to  be  large  enough.  Then  we  comprehensively 
investigated the dependence of the solution on a shape of the temperature profile, and for each considered

the same argument we have determined the actual value of electron mobility: m  e ~ (1/8 -1/6)m  e 
Bohm, which 
tends to increase with the increase of the discharge voltage. The fact that electron mobility in Hall thrusters 
appears to be several times less than the one obtained with a Bohm diffusion concept was also discovered 
by Keidar et al,9 and some other authors.10,11  

 The  numerically  obtained  profiles  are  shown  on  Fig.  4.  The  propellant  utilization  (about  86%)  and 

potential profile were found to be in a very good agreement with experiment.12  
 
As  was  already  mentioned,  the  determination  of  a  cathode  plane  location  requires  an  additional 
discussion.  From  experimental  measurements  with  the  PPPL  HT  we  know  that  the  electric  field  goes  to 
zero  and  the  electric  potential  saturates  at  several  centimeters  from  the  thruster  (beyond  the  cathode),  so 
that a voltage drop equal to the discharge voltage occurs only between the anode and any plane located in 
the saturation region. In all our simulated solutions we also obtained that saturation region on the potential 
profile for  z > Lsat, where Lsat depends on [
], and for all operational points it appeared that 
Lsat > Lc. So it seems very natural for quasi 1-D modeling to use the condition that a voltage drop equal to 

dV ,  mJ ,

in other words, choose the cathode plane at infinity. We showed that the same approach to determining free 
parameters can be applied for constructing a solution with cathode plane located at any distance from the 
anode, up to infinity.  However, outside of the channel a quasi 1-D description, which does not take into 
account radial divergence of the plasma jet, the change in electron mobility and other possible effects of the 
absence of channel walls, is the less adequate, the further from the channel exit we are trying to use it. As a 
cL  
result,  the  best  correspondence  between  simulated  and  experimental  results  was  still  achieved  with 
chosen in the plane, in which the tip of the actual cathode is physically located. Although in this problem 
setup, as could be expected, the saturation region of the potential profile (beyond the cathode plane) looks 
different from the one observed in experiments.

will  find  the  discharge  current  to  very  slowly  increase,  whereas  the  discharge  voltage  will  significantly 
decrease.  Of  course,  in  the  real  HT  the  decrease  of  discharge  voltage  at  the  same  magnetic  field  profile 
dV  should occur 
leads  to  the  decrease  of  a  discharge  current  and,  as  was  shown  before,  the decrease of

It  is  interesting  to  notice  that  our  approach  to  determining  the  free  parameters  involves  only  global 
physical  phenomena:  anode  sheath  and  sonic  transition.  So,  we  find  this  approach  applicable  for  2-D 
modeling, especially considering that 2-D effects take place mainly in the region of a strong magnetic field, 
far  from  the  anode.  Let  us  also  emphasize  that  we  showed  an  applicability  of  the  described  approach  to 
determining  free  parameters  for  modeling  of  Hall  thrusters  with  different  profiles  of  the  magnetic  field, 
qualitatively  similar  to  the  one  used  in  a  PPPL  HT.  And  we  also  believe  that  the  same  approach  can  be 
applied  for  modeling  of  other  types  of  Hall  thrusters  such  as  segmented  electrode  HT  and  anode  layer

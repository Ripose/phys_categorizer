Abstract

This  paper reports on  the  feasibility  study of  a  proton
Super-Conducting Linac (SCL)  as  a driver  for  the  High-
Flux  Breader  Reactor  (HFBR)  at  Brookhaven  National
Laboratory  (BNL).  The  Linac    operates  in  Continuos
Wave  (CW)  mode    to  produce    an  average  10  MW  of
beam  power.  The  Linac  beam  energy  is  1.0  GeV.  The
average proton beam intensity in exit is 10 mA.

1  INTRODUCTION

A  proton  SCL  has  been proposed  to  drive  an  internal
solid  target  placed  at  the  core  of  the  de-commissioned
HFBR  at  BNL. The purpose is  to  take  advantage  of  the
HFBR instrumentation and facility for the  generation of  a
continuous, high-intensity neutron source.

The SCL  driver accelerates protons  to  1  GeV, operates
in CW mode, and generates an average beam power of  10
MWatt. The average beam current is 10 mA, and the  total
length  about  300  m.  The Linac is  made of  three parts:  a
Front-End, that is  a 15  mA  ion  source, followed by  a 5-
MeV  RFQ,  a  room  temperature  150-MeV  Drift-Tube
Linac (DTL), and the  SCL  proper. This  is  made  of  two
sections: 
that
accelerates  protons  to  300  MeV,  and  the  High-Energy
Section  (HES)  that  accelerates  to  1  GeV.  The  selected
operating  frequency  is 805 MHz.

the  Medium-Energy  Section 

(MES) 

A  spreadsheet   program   has  been  used  for  the  design
and  cost  estimate.  The  design  has  shown  that  the
accelerator is  feasible,  can  be  built  in  a  relatively  short
period  of  few  years,  and  has  an  estimated  total  cost  of
about 300 M$.

2  REQUIREMENTS  OF  THE  DRIVER
The accelerator driver of  the  HFBR  facility is  a proton
SCL  about  300  m  long  with  a  straight-line  geometry.
The  proton  beam  aims  directly  to  the  core,  that  is  the
center of  the  HFBR  facility.  The  actual  location  of  the
accelerator   that  does   not  interfere    with  other  facilities
and utilities remains to be investigated.

The SCL  requirements are: 1-GeV Proton  Energy,  10-
MWatt  Beam  Power,  and  CW  Mode  of  Operation.  The
Beam  Current  at  the  exit  of  the  SCL 
is  10  mA.
Acceleration of positive-ions (protons) is assumed.

A  preliminary design has  shown  that  the  accelerator is
feasible, can be build in  a relatively  short  period  of  few
years,  and  has  a  total  cost  of  about  300-400  M$.  A

spread-sheet program [1] was used for the  design and cost
estimate,  developed  at  the  time  of  the  design  of  the
Accelerator  for  Tritium  Production  (APT)  Linac  [2,  4].
The  requirements  of  the  Linac  driving  the  HFBR  are
similar  to  those  of  a  Linac  already  investigated  for  a
different type  of  application  (Energy  Amplifier)  [3].  We
have based our estimates essentially on that design.

The accelerator is  made of  four major parts,  shown  in
Figure 1: the  Front-End, a room-temperature Low-Energy
Section, the SCL proper, and the Transport  to the Target.

The Front-End is  made  of  an  Ion  Source  placed  on  a
platform at 35-50 kVolt. It has a  continuous  beam output
of  15  mA.  It  is  followed by  a 201.25-MHZ  RFQ  which
focus,  bunch and accelerate the  beam to  about  3-5  MeV.
At the exit, the beam bunches  are compressed sufficiently
to  be squeezed within  the  rf  buckets  of  the  Low-Energy
Section which operates at 402.5  or  805  MHz.  Because of
the  relatively  low  beam  current,  and  the  absence  of
stringent  requirements  on 
the  beam  emittance  and
momentum  spread, space-charge   effects are  not  expected
to  play  a  relevant    role.  As  a  consequence,    no  major
beam losses  are expected in  the  RFQ.  A  transmission  of
80% is conservatively assumed, and the  beam intensity  at
the  exit  of  the  RFQ  is  12  mA.  We  allow  another  80%
overall transmission  efficiency, that  is  a 20%  beam loss,
during  the  transfer  of  the  beam  through  the  rest  of  the
accelerator,  all the way down to the Target. At the exit  of
the SCL, and on the Target, the beam intensity is  then  10
mA.

3      LINAC  DESIGN

  =  0.08  at  3  MeV  to  b

In  a  proton  Linac  there  is  a  large  variation  of  beam
velocity,  in  our  case  from  b
  =
0.875 at 1 GeV. The Low-Energy  section cannot be made
of  half-wavelength  super-conducting  rf  cavities,  though
quarter-wavelength    super-conducting    linear  accelerators
do  exist  and  are  successfully  operational.  We  prefer  to
adopt    here  a  room-temperature  Low-Energy  Section,
made for instance of  a  conventional  DTL  similar  to  the

We have also  assumed a cryogenic temperature of    the
rf cavities of  2  oK.  One Klystron  groups  together all  the
cavities in one  Cryo-Module. The power of  one Klystron
is  divided in  6  or  8  rf couplers, one  for  each  cavity.  To
avoid  saturation  of  the  Klystrons,  a  35%  rf  power
contingency  has been included above the  requirement   for
the normal mode of operation.

this  section 

one  operating  as  injector  to  the  Alternating  Gradient
Synchrotron  at  BNL.  We  shall  also  adopt  a  150  MeV
energy 
the  design  and
manufacturing of  the  rf  cavities  in  the  early  part  of  the
SCL  proper. Other solutions  are of  course  possible,  and
they  should  be  examined  in  a  more  careful  and  detailed
design. We shall  not  attempt  here to  say  more about  the
Front-End  and  the  Low-Energy    Section,  except  noting
that likely the cost  of  both  together   is  in  the  range   50-
100 M$ (year 2000).

Thus, the SCL proper begins at 150 MeV and ends at  1
GeV. The corresponding variation of velocity  is  from b
 =
0.5066  to  b
 = 0.8750.  Since  the  length  of  the  rf  cavity
cells is L = b
/2, it  should in  principle vary between 9.5
and 16.4 cm, with l
 = 37.3 cm,  the  rf wavelength at  805
MHz,  the  chosen operating rf frequency of  the  SCL.  To
optimize  the  accelerating  gradient,  and  the  transit  time
factor, it  would be desirable to  manufacture cavities with
cells varying in length  as  the  beam accelerates. This  may
not  be economical, and we prefer [2-4] to  manufacture  rf
cavities all with the same  cell length.  This  simplifies  the
design, and reduces the  cost,  at  the  expense  of  a  modest
reduction of  the  transit  time  factor. Here we assume  that
the  SCL  is  divided in  two  subsections  each  operating  at
two  intermediate  values  of  velocity.  A  super-conducting
MES,  from 150  to  300  MeV,  has  the  cavity  cell  length
adjusted to  the  intermediate value  b
  =  0.525.  The  HES,
from  300  MeV  to  1  GeV, 
the
intermediate  value b

is  designed  with 

 = 0.69.

The layout of the SCL is  described in  [2,  3].  For  more
details  see  also  the  related  paper  [5],  where  a  SCL
operating  in  pulsed  mode  is  described.  It  is  made  of  a
sequence of  identical periods  each  consisting  of  a  Warm
Insertion  for  the  location  of  focussing  quadrupoles,
steering  magnets,  vacuum  pumps,  and  instrumentation,
and of  a Cryo-Module including a number of  cavities  all
with  the  same number  of  individual  cells.  One  or  more
cavities  are  powered  by  a  rf  coupler  connected 
to
Klystrons, the rf power source.

The general parameters of  the  SCL  are given  in  Table
1.  Cost  and  other  parameters  used  for  our  estimate  are
shown  in  Table 2.  The  overall  design  is  summarized  in
Table 3. The cost items are quoted in year  2000 dollars.

There are four cells in  one cavity,  each 9.78  and 12.85
cm  long,  respectively  in  the  MES  and  HES.  There  are
also  six  and eight  cavities  in  one  cryostat,  separated  by
32  cm  from each  other.  The  cold-to-warm  transitions  at
both ends of the cryostat are 30  cm  long.  With  a 1-meter
long warm insertion, this makes a period 5.546  and 7.951
m long, respectively  in  the  MES  and HES.  To  focus the
transverse  motion  of  the  beam  a  FODO  sequence  of
quadrupole    magnets    is  assumed,  with  a  quadrupole
located  every  period.

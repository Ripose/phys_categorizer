Abstract

We consider two quasi-exactly solvable problems in one dimension for which

the Schr¨odinger equation can be converted to Heun’s equation. We show

that in neither case the Bender-Dunne polynomials form an orthogonal set.

Using the anti-isopectral transformation we also discover a new quasi-exactly

solvable problem and show that even in this case the polynomials do not form

an orthogonal set.

Some time ago, in a remarkable paper Bender and Dunne [1] showed that the eigen-

functions of the Schr¨odinger equation for a quasi-exactly solvable ( QES ) problem is the

generating function for a set of orthogonal polynomials {Pn(E)} in the energy variable E.

It was further shown that these polynomials satisfy the three-term recursion relation

Pn(E) = EPn−1(E) + CnPn−2(E)

(1)

where Cn is E independent quantity. Using the well known theorem [2,3], “ the necessary

and suﬃcient condition for a family of polynomials {Pn} (with degree Pn = n) to form an

orthogonal polynomial system is that {Pn} satisfy a three-term recursion relation of the

form

Pn(E) = (AnE + Bn) Pn−1(E) + CnPn−2(E)

n ≥ 1

(2)

where the coeﬃcients An, Bn and Cn are independent of E, An 6= 0, C1 = 0, Cn 6= 0 for n ≥ 1”

, it then followed that {Pn(E)} for this problem forms an orthogonal set of polynomials with

respect to some weight function, w(E). Recently several authors have studied the Bender-

Dunne polynomials in detail [3–6].

In fact it has been claimed that the Bender-Dunne

construction is quite universal and valid for any quasi-exactly solvable model in both one as

well as multi-dimensions.

The purpose of this note is to critically examine this assertion. In particular, we discuss

two QES systems, one of which is in one dimension while the other one is an eﬀective

one dimensional system. We show in both the cases that though these problems are QES

problems, the corresponding three-term recursion relation is not of the type as given in

Eq. (2), and hence the corresponding polynomials do not form an orthogonal set. Using

the anti-isospectral transformation x → ix introduced recently by Krajewska et al. [5], we

discover a new QES problem and show that even in this case the polynomials do not form

an orthogonal set.

which arises in the context of the stability analysis around the kink solution for φ6-type ﬁeld

theory in 1+1 dimensions [7]. It has already been shown that it is an example of QES system

in which both the ground and the second excited states are exactly known in the case ǫ2 = 1
2.

Further it has also been shown that contrary to the usual belief [8], this QES problem can

not be generated by the quadratic elements of an enveloping Sl(2) algebra [9]. A related fact

is that the Schr¨odinger equation for this case, after some transformations, can be written in

the form of Heun’s equation which has four regular singular points [7]. We shall now show

that in this case one can obtain a three-term recursion relation for the polynomials {Pn(E)}

which is diﬀerent from the one given in Eq. (2) and hence these polynomials do not form

an orthogonal set even though it is a QES system.

From this equation one can easily obtain the three-term recursion relation satisﬁed by the

polynomials associated with this QES system. In particular, on substituting

f (t) =

Qn(s)tn

(10)

in Eq. (9) it is easily shown that Qn’s satisfy the three-term recursion relation

(11)

Notice that the even and the odd Qn’s are unrelated and we can obtain two separate

recursion relations for them. In particular it is easily shown that for even and odd cases,

the recursion relations respectively are (m ≥ 1)

ǫ2(ǫ2 + 1)Pm(s) −

(8ǫ2 + 4)m2 + (8sǫ2 − 6ǫ2 − 4)m − 4s2 − 6sǫ2 + 3 − 11ǫ2

(13)

subject to the initial condition, P0(s) = 1.

We observe that neither of these three-term recursion relations are of the form as given

by Eq. (2) and hence we conclude that even though it is a QES problem, the corresponding

polynomials Pm(s) are not orthogonal. Note that the QES solution corresponding to the

ground state is obtained from Eqs. (10) and (13) and in this case s = 1(i.e. E = 0) and

m = 2( irrespective of the value of ǫ), while the solution corresponding to the second excited

state is obtained from Eqs. (10) and (12) when s = 1

2 (i.e. E = 3

4µ2) and m = 3 only if

ǫ2 = 1

2. Thus only for ǫ2 = 1

2, this is a QES problem.

Why is that in this case the polynomials do not form an orthogonal set? While we

do not have a deﬁnite answer, we suspect that only for those QES systems for which the

4

symmetry group is Sl(2), the corresponding polynomials form an orthonormal set. In this

context recall that for the above problem, the Hamiltonian can not be written in terms of

the quadratic generators of Sl(2) [9]. As a support to our conjecture, we oﬀer another QES

problem where also the Schr¨odinger equation can be reduced to Heun’s equation with four

regular singular points and hence the corresponding symmetry group is not Sl(2). In that

case also we ﬁnd the three-term recursion relation satisﬁed by the polynomials and show

that it is not of the type as given by Eq. (2) and hence these polynomials also do not form

an orthogonal set.

when n ≥ 1 and P0 = 1. We again observe that the recursion relation is not of the type

given by Eq. (2) and hence it follows that the polynomials Pn(β) do not form an orthogonal

set. The QES solutions in this case have already been discussed in Ref. [10].

Summarizing, we have seen that there are QES problems in one dimension and eﬀective

one dimension where the symmetry group is not Sl(2), the Schr¨odinger equation get con-

verted to Heun’s equation, and the corresponding polynomials do not form an orthogonal

set. It will be interesting to ﬁnd the symmetry group in these cases.

Before ﬁnishing this note we would like to point out a nontrivial application of the anti-

isospectral transformation induced recently by Krajewska et al. [5]. In particular, applying

it we are able to discover a new QES problem in quantum mechanics. Consider the potential

given in Eq. 3 and apply the transformation x → iθ. We then obtain a new QES problem

which has not been discussed in the literature so far. In particular the ground and second

excited state energies of the new (periodic) potential

written down. Needless to say in this case also one can obtain a three-term recursion

relation and show that it is not of the type as given by Eq.

(2). Thus this provides a

third QES problem where the Bender-Dunne polynomials do not form an orthogonal set.

The details will be given elsewhere [11] where we will also discuss other applications of the

anti-isospectral transformation.

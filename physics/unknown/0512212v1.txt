Abstract:  

In this letter, we study the scattering of light by a single subwavelength slit in a metal screen. 

In  contrast  to  previous  theoretical  works,  we  provide  a  microscopic  description  of  the 

scattering process by emphasizing the generation of surface plasmons at the slit apertures. The 

analysis  is  supported  by  a  rigorous  formalism  based  on  a  normal-mode-decomposition 

technique and by a semi-analytical model which provides accurate formulae for the plasmonic 

generation  strengths.  The  generation  is  shown  to  be  fairly  efficient  for  metals  with  a  low 

conductivity,  like  gold  in  the  visible  regime.  Verification  of  the  theory  is  also  shown  by 

comparison with recent experimental data [H.F. Schouten et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 053901 

(2005)].

Light  scattering  by  a  single  subwavelength  aperture  in  a  metal  screen,  like  a  hole  or  a  slit, 

represents  a  basic  diffraction  phenomenon  which  has  been  studied  for  a  long  time  [1]. 

Following  the  discovery  of  the  extraordinary  transmission  [2]  through  nanohole  arrays  in 

thick  metallic  films,  this  basic  diffraction  problem  has  recently  sparked  a  wealth  of 

experimental  and  theoretical  works  aiming  at  understanding  the  underlying  physics  and  at 

developing potential applications of light manipulation on a subwavelength scale [3]. Single 

nanoapertures, isolated or dressed by shallow corrugation [4-5-6-7], are currently investigated 

at visible and microwave frequencies. Studies of the aforementioned structures have revealed 

that  surface  plasmon  polaritons  (SPPs)  launched  at  the  input  and  output  sides  of  the 

nanoaperture  drastically  impact  the  scattering  properties.  The  SPP  interpretation  has  been 

evidenced  by  recent  experimental  works  revealing  surprising  phenomena,  like  the  strong 

angular  confinement  of  light  transmitted  through  a  single  nanoaperture  dressed  by  shallow 

corrugation [4] or the modulation of the total far-field intensity diffracted by a pair of slits as 

in  Young's  experiment  [8],  or  by  direct  near-field  measurements  [9].  On  a  theoretical  side, 

little  is  know  on  the  SPP  generation  at  the  nanoaperture  entrance.  Earlier  works  [1]  have 

considered perfectly-conducting metal and have not addressed the problem. Whether they rely 

on  semi-analytic  [10,5,6]  or  on  intensive  computational  approaches  [9,11-12],  recent  works 

well  support  far-field  experimental  data  on  the  transmission  for  instance,  but  do  not 

quantitatively  address  the  SPP  generation.  Calculated  near-fields  qualitatively  support  the 

existence of SPPs, but no microscopic mechanism for the coupling to SPPs is provided : for 

instance,  the  question  arises  how  much  light  is  scattered  into  SPPs  at  a  nanoscale  aperture 

entrance. 

In this letter, we consider the SPP generation at a metallic interface perforated by an 

isolated  subwavelength  slit,  when  the  slit  is  illuminated  by  its  fundamental  guided  mode 

(Fig. 1a) or by an incident plane wave (Fig.1b). The configuration is semi-infinite on the two -

 

2

z-half  spaces.  We  first  present  a  general  theoretical  formalism  for  the  calculation  of  the 

scattering  coefficients  between  the  incident  light  and  the  SPP  modes  launched  at  the  slit 

aperture. Rigorous calculations show that, for metals with a low conductivity like gold in the 

visible regime, the fraction of the incident radiation which couples into the SPP is fairly large, 

reaching  values  as  high  as  the  total  far-field  radiated  energy.  In  a  second  step,  we  derive  a 

semi-analytical  model  which  quantitatively  agrees  with  the  rigorous  calculations.  This 

derivation is motivated by the fact that simple intuitive theoretical formalisms have not been 

yet presented for the SPP generation at apertures, despite its importance for light manipulation 

at a subwavelength scale. Realistic expressions for the generation strength may be also useful 

for  experimentalists  in  their  plasmonic  devices  or  instruments.  The  model  allows  us  to 

understand the influence of the different parameters of the scattering problem. Additionally, it 

quantitatively  interprets  the  recent  observation  of  far-field  intensity  modulations  in  the 

double-slit experiment [8]. 

Hereafter, the metal is considered as a real metal with a finite conductivity. Gold will 

be used to illustrate our discussion and its frequency-dependent permittivity values ε is taken 

from  Ref. [13].  Let  us  first  consider  the  geometry  shown  in  Fig. 1a.  The  slit  has  the  same 

direction as the magnetic field Hy (transverse-magnetic polarization) and is illuminated by its 

fundamental guided mode at a fixed wavelength λ (k = 2π/λ = ω/c). In the figure, n1 and n2 

refer to the refractive indices of the dielectric materials inside and below the slit. We denote 

by w the slit width. Inside the slit, the magnetic field admits a modal expansion of the form

where  u2+(γu)2 = 1.  Many  numerical  tools  can  provide  electromagnetic-field  distributions 

inside  and  below  the  slit  by  rigorously  solving  for  the  reflection  rp  and  transmission  tu 

amplitudes  [8-12].  Here,  we  have  used  a  Fourier  modal  method  [14]  for  that  purpose.  For 

visible light, λ =0.6 µm, Fig. 2a shows the electromagnetic fields Hy(x,z) and Ez(x,z) which 

will  be  of  main  concern  in  the  following.  The  near-field  pattern  below  the  slit  is  a 

superposition of many evanescent and propagative waves and exhibits a marked expansion of 

several wavelengths away from the slit aperture in the x-direction. This is consistent with the 

involvement of SPPs at the slit aperture. However, the respective roles of the evanescent field 

and of the SPP waves deserve to be clarified. To explore this question, we propose an original 

approach  which  basically  relies  on  the  completeness  theorem  for  the  normal  modes  of 

waveguides  [15].  That  theorem,  which  provides  a  useful  electromagnetic  representation  of 

light  propagation  in  translationally  invariant  systems,  stipulates  that  any  transverse  field 

pattern  of  such  a  system  can  be  decomposed  as  a  linear  combination  of  forward-  and 

backward-travelling  bounded  and  radiative  modes.  Thus  for  our  slit  geometry  and  for 

x > |w/2|,  it  results  that  the  transverse  electromagnetic  fields  shown  in  Figs. 2a-2b  can  be 

expanded into the set of normal modes of a flat gold-air interface [16]:

In  Eqs.  3a-3b,  the  summation  refers  to  radiative  modes  and  {HSP,  ESP}  are  the  transverse 

magnetic and electric fields of a SPP mode with unit intensity launched at a metallic/dielectric 

interface. These fields are known analytically [17] : HSP(z) = (NSP)-1/2 exp(i γSP z), with NSP a 

normalization  constant  and  γSP = [εk2-(kSP)2]1/2  in  the  metal  and  [(n2k)2-(kSP)2]1/2  in  the

Eqs.  3a-b,  α+(x)  and  α-(x)  are  coefficients  of  central  importance  to  the  present  discussion 

related  to  the  SPP  generation.  The  plus  and  minus  superscripts  refer  to  SPP  propagating

w/2) represent the unknown complex coefficients related to the strengths of the SPP excitation 

at the exit sides of the slit. Because of the mode orthogonality condition, we have [16]:

From Eqs. 4a-4b, the coefficients α+(x) and α-(x) can be derived by calculating numerically 

the overlap integrals on the left-hand sides of the equations. Figure 2b represents the modulus 

squared of these coefficients for the scattering problem considered in Fig. 2a. The results are 

obtained for an incident slit mode with a unit intensity ; thus |α+(x)|2 and |α-(x)|2 represent the 

normalized SPP generation efficiencies. For -w/2 < x < w/2, the coefficients are meaningless 

since there is no air-metal interface. Let us consider |α+(x)|2, the discussion is similar for |α-

(x)|2. For x > w/2, the computed |α+(x)|2 values perfectly fulfil the expected SPP attenuation 

law,  |α+(w/2)|2 exp[-2Im(kSP) (x-w/2)]  shown  as  circles  in  Fig. 2b.  Further  analysis,  not 

reported here, have shown that the phase dependence of α+(x) exactly coincides with the SPP 

propagation  constant  exp[-iRe(kSP) (x-w/2)].  Consistently  with  the  outgoing  radiation 

condition at the slit output, |α+(x)|2 is found to be approximately null for x < w/2, |α+(x)|2 < 

10-6 for any x in the computational window. In our opinion, all this provides a strong support 

for the soundness of the normal-mode-decomposition formalism used for quantifying the SPP 

excitation.

In  order  to  gain  better  physical  insight  into  the  problem  and  to  obtain  useful 

expressions  for  the  SPP  generation,  we  have  developed  an  intuitive  approximate  model.  As 

suggested by the rigorous formalism, the SPP generation results from a two-stage mechanism 

: a purely geometric diffraction problem followed by the launching of a SPP bounded mode 

on a flat interface. We have assumed that the diffraction problem which results in a specific 

near-field  distribution  in  the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  slit  (the  Hy,Ez  fields  of  Eqs.  4a-b  at 

x = ±w/2)  is  weakly  dependent  on  the  dielectric  properties  of  the  metal  and  that  it  can  be 

estimated by considering the metal as a perfect conductor. On the contrary, the launching of 

the  bounded  SSP  mode  strongly  depends  on  the  intrinsic  dielectric  properties  of  the  metal-

dielectric  interface  (the  HSP,ESP  fields  of  Eqs.  4a-b).  Assuming  an  ideal  metal  drastically 

reduces the scattering problem complexity and, under the approximation that the field in the 

slit  is  solely  composed  of  the  forward-incident  and  backward-reflected  fundamental  modes, 

the  field  distribution  {Hy(±w/2,z),  Ez(±w/2,z)}  can  be  calculated  analytically.  Our  approach 

follows that developed in [18] for slit arrays. From the near-field distribution obtained for a 

slit  in  a  perfect  metal,  the  overlap  integrals  of  Eq. 4a-b  is  subsequently  calculated  for 

x = ±w/2.  We  do  not  provide  here  the  details  of  the  lengthy  calculation  and  just  give  the 

results. One obtains :

Figure  3  summarizes  the  main  useful  results  predicted  for  slits  in  gold  over  a  broad 

spectral interval ranging from the visible to thermal infrared. All plots are relative to the total 

SPP-excitation efficiency eSP on both sides of the aperture, eSP being equal to |α+(w/2)|2+|α-

(w/2)|2 in (a) and (b), and to |β+(w/2)|2+|β-(w/2)|2 in (c). In order to access the accuracy of the 

model  predictions  (solid  curves),  we  have  performed  extensive  calculations  using  the 

theoretical  formalism,  as  in  Fig. 2.  The  corresponding  data  are  shown  with  marks.  A 

quantitative  agreement  is  obtained  for  all  cases  ;  the  larger  the  wavelength,  the  better  the 

agreement  as  expected  from  the  perfectly-conducting  metal  approximation.  At  visible 

frequencies, the SPP excitation is surprisingly efficient. For an optimal slit width of w ≈ 0.23λ 

(a value nearly independent of the metal permittivity), as much light (≈40%) is scattered into 

the SPPs as it is radiated in the far-field. For longer wavelengths, eSP rapidly decreases ; the 

maximum  efficiency  is  only  2.8%  for  λ = 10 µm,  and  is  predicted  to  be  as  low  as  1%  for 

λ = 18 µm.  From  Eq. (5),  it  is  easily  shown  that  the  efficiency  scales  as  |ε(λ)|-1/2  because 

|ε| << (n2)2. Figure 3b shows the impact of the substrate refractive index. As n2 increases, eSP 

increases  as  well  (|α+(w/2)|2  ∝  n2/n1),  and  the  optimal  slit  width  for  best  excitation  slightly 

decreases. As shown in Fig. 3c, these trends remain valid when the slit aperture is illuminated 

by an incident plane-wave, a 50%-efficient SPP-excitation being predicted for λ = 0.6 µm and 

for the optimal slit width. This indicates that even simple metallic structures, like slits, may be 

used to efficiently manipulate SPP visible waves at a nanoscale level. 

 

7

To  further  validate  the  model,  we  now  rub  it  with  experimental  data.  The  recent 

plasmon-assisted  Young's  type  experiment  [8]  provides  a  test-bed  for  our  microscopic 

theoretical treatment. In this experiment, the total power radiated by two slits separated by a 

few micrometers has been shown to be enhanced or reduced as a function of the wavelength 

of the incident beam. The transmission through the slits can be predicted by use of a classical 

Fabry-Perot  model  [18]  by  assuming  that  the  energy  transfer  within  the  slit  is  solely 

performed  through  the  fundamental  slit  mode.  However,  calculations  have  shown  that  the 

bouncing  of  the  fundamental  mode  marginally  affects  the  analysis  and  that  the  experiment 

data  can  be  interpreted  by  simply  evaluating  the  power  S  coupled  into  each  single  slit,  see 

Fig. 4a. Reciprocity warrants that the scattering coefficient from SPP to slit-mode is equal to 

the α-, which corresponds to the back-conversion process from slit-mode to SPP. Therefore, 

for an incident plane wave with a unit power per slit-opening area, S is given by S = |t0 + α- β+ 

exp[ikSP(d-w)]|2. The modulation of the coupled power S is shown in Figs. 4b-4c. The contrast 

C = 2|t0/(α- β+)| ≈ 0.26  which  is  nearly  constant  in  the  spectral  range  well  agrees  with  the 

experimental  values  C ≈ 0.2,  but  more  importantly,  the  minima  and  maxima  of  S  exactly 

coincide  with  the  experimental  ones,  see  Fig. 1  in  [8]  for  comparison,  evidencing  that  the 

important phase factors associated to the SPP scattering and back conversion processes is well 

predicted by the model. 

 

In  conclusion,  we  have  studied  the  generation  of  SPP  waves  at  a  metallic  interface 

perforated by an isolated subwavelength slit. A rigorous formalism based on a normal-mode-

decomposition  technique  has  been  derived.  We  have  also  proposed  a  semi-analytical  model 

which has been validated by comparisons with computational data obtained from the rigorous 

formalism  and  with  experimental  data  recently  reported  for  the  transmission  through  a  slit 

doublet. It has been shown that the SPP-generation processes can be very efficient at visible 

frequencies  for  noble  metals.  The  rigorous  formalism  which  relies  on  fundamentals  in 

 

8

electromagnetism  can  be  applied  to  other  related  geometries  and  we  believe  that  the  semi-

analytical  model  could  be  as  well  generalized  to  slit  arrays  or  holes.  Thus  the  theoretical 

treatment  is  expected  to  be  able  to  provide  a  microscopic  description  of  various  plasmonic 

devices of current interest.

In nearly all concepts invoked or proposed to change or shield gravity it is intuitively 

assumed that manipulation of gravity automatically leads to a breakthrough for propulsion. In 

this  study  it  is  shown,  that  even  if  gravity  could  be  hypothetically  controlled  along  the 

manipulation schemes outlined, based the gains in terms of propulsion would be modest and 

lead  to  no  breakthrough.  Although  the  manipulation  schemes  presented  are  not  exhaustive, 

they include the most straightforward ones from the current physics point of view.

Introduction 
 
 

As  part  of  its  advanced  space  propulsion  program,  NASA  created  the  Breakthrough 

Propulsion  Physics  Program  in  1996  to  look  for  new  concepts  in  propulsion  that  can 

ultimately enable interstellar travel1,2. Nearly all concepts proposed involve some method to 

alter  gravity,  such  as  warp  drives3,  transient  mass  fluctuations4,5,  or  gravitational  shielding 

effects6.  They  all  intuitively  assume,  without  any  justification,  that  manipulation  of  gravity 

would automatically lead to a breakthrough for propulsion. 

Subsequentially,  in  2001,  the  European  Space  Agency  (ESA)  funded  a  study  to 

evaluate the concept of gravity control in light of current theories of gravity and field theory 

as  well  as  to  assess  the  scientific  credibility  of  claims  in  the  literature  of  anomalous 

gravitational experiments and phenomena7. Furthermore, the study was to analyse the impact 

on spacecraft propulsion of any degree of gravity control. 

 

 

 

As anticipated, the first part of the study yielded no surprises as current experimental 

knowledge and bounds on the fundamental underlying principles of General Relativity and of 

the Standard Model of the Fundamental Interactions leave little room for the gravity control 

proposals that were analysed. Among these we could mention exotic concepts such as theories 

where  gravitiy  is  due  to  interactions  with  the  Zero-Point-Energy  field8,9,  warp-drive 

mechanisms3  or  propulsion  concepts  based  on  Mach's  principle4,5.  None  of  the  approaches 

examined proved fruitful. However, the second part of the study has turned out to be rather 

rich  in  new  findings.  Our  main  conclusion  was  that  even  if  gravity  could  be  controlled  or 

modified,  influence  on  spacecraft  propulsion  would  be  quite  modest  and  would  not  lead  to 

breakthroughs in the conceptual framework of presently known propulsion principles within 

the  studied  manipulation  schemes.  We  regard  this  result  of  particular  importance  to  the 

 
 

 
 
 

 

Breakthrough Propulsion Physics community and should, in our opinion, be considered in any 

further work on the topic. 

Gravity Control 

Current  knowledge  of  gravitational  phenomena  is  accurately  described  by  Einstein's 

Theory of General Relativity. The theory matches all known experimental data. Experimental 

windows of opportunity can be found in the untested ground of gravity-like forces below the 

millimetre  scale  or  beyond  1012  km,  or  in  violations  of  the  Weak  Equivalence  Principle  for 

anti-particles. Consistency between Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity that requires 

a  still  elusive  quantum  gravity  theory,  leads  for  instance  to  the  quite  novel  framework  of 

Superstring physics, and this theory may give rise to new effects, such as a deviation from the 

Weak  Equivalence  Principle  at  the  10-18  level10.  The  reader  is  referred  to  Ref.  7  for  an 

extensive review of these issues. 

In  addition  to  changes  in  the  inertial  or  gravitational  mass,  there  is  one  aspect  of 

General Relativity that is more closely related to possible propulsion applications. In lowest 

order of the weak field limit, General Relativity can be restructured in a way that it closely 

resembles  Maxwell´s  equations11.  In  this  context,  there  is  a  similarity  between  moving 

charges  and  moving  masses,  to  which  the  classical  laws  of  electromagnetism  apply.  For 

instance, a mass in motion generates a gravitational interaction that is similar to a magnetic 

field,  the  so-called  gravitomagnetic  field.  This  gravitomagnetic  field  can  interact  with  other 

gravitomagnetic fields creating forces12. Such forces are very weak (usually 10-20 N or less in 

Earth like environments), but can in principle be detected by extremely sensitive gyroscopes 

such as the ones developed for NASA's Gravity Probe B (GP-B) mission. The frame dragging 

effect  of  the  Earth  was  experimentally  measured  using  the  LAGEOS  and  LAGEOS  II  laser 

ranging satellites13 and will be further investigated in NASA’s GP-B mission. 

 

Induction  laws  such  as  the  ones  encountered  in  electromagnetism  exist  in  this 

approximation of General Relativity making possible the conversion of gravitoelectric fields 

into gravitomagnetic fields and vice-versa. Effects related to the gravitomagnetic field are also 

referred  to  as  frame-dragging  or  Lense-Thirring  effect.  We  shall  analyse  in  more  detail  the 

effects for propulsion arising from such forces in a later section. 

In quite general terms, we find that any scheme to hypothetically control gravity must 

fulfil at least one of the following conditions: 

1.  Existence of a new fundamental interaction of nature so to alter the effective strength of 

the  gravitational  coupling  to  matter.  This  implies  violations  of  the  Weak  Equivalence 

2.  Existence  of  net  forces  due  to  the  interplay  between  gravity  and  electrostatic  forces  in 

shielded experimental configurations, as found in the well-known Schiff-Barnhill effect14. 

3.  Analogous effect for magnetic fields in quantum materials involving the gravitomagnetic 

4.  Physically  altering  the  vacuum  properties  so  to  change  the  relative  strength  of  known 

fundamental interactions of nature.

Classical Spacecraft Propulsion and Definition of Terms 

All classical propulsion systems rely on Newton's mechanics. Equations characterizing 

the performance of any propulsion system can be found in a large variety of textbooks such as 

in Ref. 17. In this section, we will recall basic equations that will be used for the analysis of 

influence on gravity control. 

In general terms, assuming a constant propellant velocity, the force F is defined as 

 

 

 

where 

pm&

  is  the  propellant  mass  flow  and  vp  the  propellant  velocity.  To  a  good 

approximation,  the  specific  impulse  Isp  is  proportional  to  the  propellant  exhaust  velocity. 

Neglecting the influence of the nozzle or the ambient atmosphere, the propellant velocity for a 

simple chemical thruster can be written as

where  γ  is  the  adiabatic  index,  R  is  the  universal  gas  constant,  Tc  the  temperature  in  the 

combustion  chamber  and  µp  the  molar  mass  of  the  propellant.  We  clearly  see,  that  the 

following scaling laws are valid:

Apart  from  electromagnetic  thrusters,  these  scaling  laws  also  apply  for  other 

propulsion  systems  such  as  electric  thrusters  (e.g.  hall,  ion,  or  field  emission  thrusters)  to  a 

good approximation. The amount of propellant needed for a given mission is derived from the 

trajectory  analysis  and  is  typically  expressed  as  the  required  change  of  velocity  from  the 

spacecraft, ∆v. The total requirement consists of several components,

namely  the ∆vg  to  overcome  the  gravitational  potential  (e.g.  from  the  Earth's  surface  to  the 

required  orbit),  ∆vdrag  due  to  drag  from  the  atmosphere  (usually  around  0.1  km/s),  ∆vorbit 

giving the velocity increment to reach a certain orbit and ∆vinitial the initial velocity (e.g. due 

to  the  Earth's  centrifugal  force  which  on  the  Equator  is  about  0.4  km/s).  The  following

where  G  is  the  gravitational  constant,  M  the  Earth's  mass  and  r  the  orbit's  distance  to  the 

center of the Earth. For example, a Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) of 100 km altitude (rinitial = 6400 

km, rorbit = 6500 km), results in ∆vorbit = 7.8 km/s and ∆vg = 1.4 km/s, starting from Earth's 

surface. The total requirement would then be ∆vLEO = (1.4+0.1+7.8-0.4) km/s = 8.9 km/s. The 

propellant mass necessary to meet the full ∆v requirement can be calculated using the well-

known Tsiolkovski equation:

Influence of Gravity Manipulation on Spacecraft Propulsion 

In the following discussion we shall consider a series of hypothetical devices capable 

of manipulating mass (with influence in current propulsion systems) or generating an artificial 

gravitational  field  (new  propulsion  concept  using  gravity  control).  As  already  discussed,  no 

such devices are known. Nevertheless, several combinations (during launch and in space) are 

going to be analysed and their influence on propulsion systems or as a force generator will be 

discussed.  In  order  to  avoid  complexity  (we  are  talking  about  hypothetical  gravity  control 

devices anyhow), we do not endow any special attributes to the gravity control manipulator 

and do not limit its manipulation to certain distances. 

 

Inertial Mass Modification 

Let us assume a device that can change the inertial mass of bodies in its interior, such 

as  a  launcher.  If  the  spacecraft  were  to  fire  conventional  chemical  rockets  or  electric 

propulsion  thrusters  how  would  this  device  affect  performance?  We  define  an  inertial  mass 

modification factor δ and introduce it into the equations for the specific impulse and force for 

chemical thrusters:

and hence, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 
and 
 
 

Notice  that  these  are  the  same  scaling  laws  previously  discussed.  Thus,  hypothetical 

inertial mass modification is similar to choosing propellant with a different molar mass. These 

laws are similar for all other classical propulsion systems. The only advantage would be that 

by manipulating inertial mass, the chamber temperature Tc is not really changing. This might 

not be the case for choosing a lighter propellant in chemical thrusters (e.g. H2/O2 instead of 

Kerosen/O2). If Tc is lower, the specific impulse drops as well. Also the spacecraft mass can 

be reduced conventionally, e.g. by using lightweight structures. This will then reduce the ∆v 

requirement accordingly – but not affect the propulsion system performance. 

How is the ∆v requirement influenced? The kinetic energy has now to be multiplied by 

the factor δ and one derives the modified equations:

Hence, an inertial mass reduction would actually increase the ∆v requirement! For the 

extreme case of δ = 0, the launcher would not move any more (F = 0) and accordingly the ∆v 

requirement would be infinite. Thus, for 0 < δ < 1, thrust F would increase while the specific 

impulse Isp would decrease (see Fig. 1). This is similar to using a heavier propellant, e.g. solid 

boosters with alumna oxides instead of H2/O2 chemical thrusters. 

 

 

An interesting result is that Tsiolkovski's Eq. (7) is not affected at all by a modification 

on  the  inertial  mass.  Indeed,  to  a  good  approximation  one  can  neglect ∆vdrag  and ∆vinitial  so 

that the total ∆v ∝ δ-1/2. Furthermore, one can see that all δ factors are cancelled out in Eq. (7). 

Therefore,  whatever  is  the  inertial  mass  modification,  the  amount  of  propellant  will  not  be 

changed,  or  in  other  words,  the  change  in  the  propulsion  performance  is  always 

counterbalanced by the change in the ∆v requirement!  

 
We conclude that a modification on the inertial mass is of no of interest for propulsion.  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gravitational Mass Modification 

We  turn  now  to  the  analysis  on  the  modification  on  the  gravitational  mass.  Such 

modification does not influence propulsion performance (thrust, specific impulse), only parts 

of the ∆v requirement are affected in this case. By using the gravitational mass modification 

factor dividing the gravitational by the intertial mass, ε=mg/mi, we get

Neglecting  as  before ∆vdrag  and ∆vinitial,  we  obtain, ∆v  ∝ ε1/2,  approximately.  The  modified

If  the  gravitational  mass  would  be  reduced,  that  is ε  <  1,  the ∆v  requirement  would 

drop  and  less  propellant  mass  would  be  required.  For  a  satellite  orbiting  the  Earth,  our 

modified definition of ∆vorbit in Eq. (13) also increases the time it needs to make a full orbit 

(less speed to cycle the Earth). This may not be important for launching interplanetary probes, 

but affects for instance, remote sensing or Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellites which require 

cycling Earth with a certain speed for the purpose of mapping and telecommunication. In such 

cases the full ∆vorbit (ε = 1) would have to be applied with no reduction, which then in turn 

causes an unstable orbit since the centrifugal force would be higher than the gravitational pull. 

To counterbalance this effect, two different strategies are possible: 

 

 

 

•  Launch  of  the  spacecraft  with  the  gravitational  mass  manipulator  (GMM)  activated. 

Once in orbit, deactivate GMM and apply full ∆vorbit using a propulsion system. The 

centrifugal force is then balanced by the gravitational push. 

•  GMM  is  always  active  and  use  propulsion  system  to  counterbalance  the  higher 

centrifugal force to stay in orbit. 

 

 

As an example we consider a scientific satellite for a planetary target (∆v = 10 km/s) 

with  a  chemical  thruster  (vp  =  3500  m/s).  In  this  case  we  do  not  need  a  full ∆vorbit  and  our 

above  mentioned  concerns  do  not  apply.  Fig.  2  the  ∆v  and  propellant  mass  ratio  (mp/m0) 

reduction  are  plotted  as  a  function  of ε.  For ε  =  0.05,  only  half  of  the  propellant  would  be 

required. Of course, shielding very close to ε = 0 would reduce the propellant consumption to 

zero and a very direct trajectory to the target would be possible. Applying Newton’s laws, the 

trip  time  to  reach  a  required ∆v  scales  with  ε1/2.  Therefore,  shielding  of  gravitational  mass 

does  reduce  the  trip  time,  however,  even  shielding  of ε  =  0.05  only  reduces  trip  time  by  a 

factor  of  4.5.  In  conclusion,  unless  almost  total  shielding  can  be  achieved,  there  is  no 

breakthrough in the overall trip time. 

 

 

Let  us  assume  the  extreme  case  where  the  gravitational  mass  vanishes  and  thus ∆vg 

vanishes. The ∆v requirement, still including the full ∆vorbit for typical LEO satellites, would 

then change from Eq. (4) to 

v

(15)

 

 

Considering  again  our  previous  100  km  LEO  example,  the  case  of ∆vg    =  0  would 

reduce the total ∆v requirement from the initial 8.9 km/s by 1.4 km/s, that is down to 7.5 km/s. 

So a launcher, although with less propellant, is still required. The higher the original ∆vg, the 

higher the possible reduction of the total ∆v. GEO satellites with a high altitude of 42,160 km 

could reduce in this case from a total ∆v of about 13 km/s to 3 km/s which would require a 

 

 

 

 

much  smaller  propulsion  system  reducing  launch  costs  drastically.  Only  in  the  case  where 

∆vorbit is not important, as in e.g. interplanetary spacecraft, we can assume a full reduction to

(16)

If  the  spacecraft  is  close  to  the  Equator,  then ∆vinitial  ≈  0.4  km/s  from  the  spinning 

Earth is higher than ∆vdrag ≈ 0.1 km/s and so it would start lifting by itself. That could lead to 

completely new launch strategies and would certainly be a breakthrough. 

How  far  are  we  away  from  such  a  possible  breakthrough?  The  experimental 

verification  of  the  Weak  Equivalence  Principle  indicates  that ε  =  1  ±  5x10-13.  On  the  other 

hand, string theory predicts10 that ε = 1 ± 1x10-18. Obviously, these values do not influence 

propulsion  at  all.  As  previously  outlined,  significant  deviations  from ε  =  1  are  not  forseen, 

unless,  for  instance,  the  behaviour  of  antiparticles  on  a  gravitational  field  is  substantially 

different from the one of particles. 

 

 
Even  if  situations  where ε  ≠  1  can  be  engineered,  they  would  have  to  compete  with 

concepts such as electric propulsion, which can lower the propellant consumption already by 

90%  with  much  higher  propellant  velocities.  There  are  also  technologies  and  concepts 

available  which  can  reduce  the ∆v  requirement  and  trip  time.  One  example  is  to  reduce  the 

gravitational potential ∆vg simply by launching from a mountain or to supply a higher initial 

velocity ∆vinitial by launching from an airplane (e.g. the Pegasus rocket from Orbital Sciences 

Corporation is currently being launched from an aircraft for reduction of the ∆v requirement). 

NASA,  for  instance,  is  developing  an  initial  acceleration  rail  for  future  spacecraft  that  uses 

superconducting  magnetic  levitation  (MAGLIFTER)  to  fire  the  rocket  engine  after  the 

spacecraft reached a speed of 300 m/s. For an extreme summary of launch assist technology, 

see  Ref.  18.  An  extreme  concept  was  out  forward  by  Arthur  C.  Clarke19,  who  proposed  to 

built an ultra-high tower, which was named space elevator, for lifting spacecraft to orbits as 

high as 100 km. 

 
 
Dipolar Gravito-Electric Field 

The possibility to generate artificial gravitational fields would enable new concepts for 

space propulsion. According to the induction laws of gravitomagnetism11,12, such an artificial 

field would look like a dipole composed by gravito-electric fields. The most straightforward 

propulsion concept would be to interact with the Earth’s gravitational field, as outlined in Fig. 

3.  Such  a  field  configuration  could  be  used  to  generate  a  torque  orientating  the  spacecraft 

parallel to the planet gravitational field. In analogy with electromagnetism, we can write 

 

v
v
= µτ
g
g

v
g

×

 , 

(17)

where τg is the torque, µg the gravitoelectric dipole momentum and g the Earth's gravitational 

field. Since much simpler conventional concepts are available, we shall not elaborate further 

on  this  idea.  The  simplest  one  is  the  so-called  gravity  boom20,  which  is  used  in  almost  all 

small satellites. It consists of a test mass along a deployable boom attached to the spacecraft. 

Due  to  the  gravitational  gradient,  the  boom  always  points  the  satellite  towards  Earth.  In 

addition to its simplicity, such a device does not require any power at all. 

We want to stress that such a dipolar gravito-electric field is not at all a gravitational dipole, 

which  is  a  mathematical  object  composed  of  a  positive  and  negative  mass.  A  gravitational 

 

 

 

 

dipole would be self-accelerating21, however, it was been clearly shown that negative masses 

are forbidden in gravitational physics and that a propulsion system based on such a concept 

does not make sense7. The impossibility of negative mass in our universe has been shown by 

the positive energy theorem22,23, which is known to apply to all known matter in both normal 

and  extreme  cosmological  situations.  Violations  of  the  energy  conditions  are  possible  in 

quantum theories, but the effects are fleeting and require exotic equations of state24-26.  

 

 

Wire-like Gravitomagnetic Field 

Through  the  use  of  a  "wire-like''  gravitoelectric  field  or  a  gravitomagnetic  field,  one 

could  generate  a  gravitational  analogue  of  the  Lorentz  force.  This  could  be  used  as  a 

propulsion  system  (see  Fig.  4)  interacting  with  a  planet's  gravitomagnetic  field.  By  using 

Gravitoelectromagnetism,  one  can  conceive  a  gravitational  analogue  of  an  electrodynamic 

tether. The force F produced by a wire in a gravitational field can be expressed as 

 

 

F

=

⋅

I

m

⋅

l

 , 

B

g
c

(18)

where Bg is the gravitomagnetic field (for Earth Bg = 3.3x10-14 rad/s), Im = dm/dt, is the mass 

current and l the length of the wire. For Im = 3000 kg/s (for example by pumping liquid metal 

through a tube), a length of 1 km and the Earth's gravitomagnetic field, this force is equal to 

0.1 µN. Comparing this unrealistic concept (huge Im) with an electrodynamical tether used for 

satellites, with a typical power consumption of only 2.4 kW, a force of 0.36 N is produced in 

LEO. Therefore, a gravitational analogue adds no extra benefit to current tether technology. 

Even  if  much  larger  gravitomagnetic  fields  than  the  one  produced  by  the  Earth  could  be 

produced, e.g. using superconductors as proposed in Ref. 16, this conclusion does not change. 

Conclusion 

We  can  summarize  our  results  as  follows.  Within  the  context  of  propulsion  devices  

based on the reaction principle, our study reveals that control of gravity, even if achievable, 

would  not  imply  in  a  breakthrough  for  propulsion,  even  though  it  could  be  of  major 

importance for e.g. possible microgravity applications on Earth. This is of course only valid 

for the manipulation schemes outlined. Although the manipulation schemes presented are not 

exhaustive, they include the most straightforward ones from the current physics point of view. 

 

 

 

More concretely our analysis reveals that modification of inertial mass would bring no 

influence  at  all,  and  the  modification  of  gravitational  mass  would  have  to  compete  with 

classical-launch assist technologies such as launching from an airplane, top of a mountain, or 

in  an  extreme  case,  from  an  ultra-high  tower.  Moreover,  the  use  of  gravitomagnetic  or 

gravitoelectric  fields  for  propulsion  would  not  bring  any  extra  benefit  when  compared  to 

classical electrodynamical tethers or gravity booms. Our conclusions are summarized in Table 

1.  We  believe,  that  the  result  of  our  analysis  is  a  valuable  input  to  ongoing  breakthrough 

propulsion activities in the Unites States and Europe.

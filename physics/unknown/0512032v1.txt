Abstract.  Observers  at  rest  in  two  inertial  reference  frames  are  located  within  the 
propagation  space  of  the  same  electromagnetic  wave.  Raising  receiving  antennas  in  a 
suitable  way,  these  observers  use  the  electromagnetic  oscillations  in  the  wave  as  an 
electromagnetic clock. The invariance of the wave phase ensures that the observers of the 
two  frames  detect  the  same  phase  of  the  oscillation  when  they  are  located  at  the  same 
point in space and consequently theirs synchronization proceeds automatically. Because 
the Doppler Effect is free of any clock synchronization, we use the formula that accounts 
for this effect for deriving the basic formulas of relativistic kinematics.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
 
Special  relativity  theory  is  a  very  flexible  chapter  of  physics.  As  a 
consequence, we can begin its presentation with an arbitrary chosen chapter 
of physics and end it with another one, in an arbitrary succession, giving rise 
to an endless number of papers and textbooks.1,2,3 
Karlov4 considers that “Educators in physics can become creatures of 
 
habits like people in any field of activity. Having been taught a course in a 
particular way, in a sequence of steps patterned after recognized textbooks, 
they  naturally  tend  to  pass  the  same  methods  to  successive  classes  of 
physics.  From  time  to  time,  in  this  process,  more  textbooks  are  written 
which again retrace the well worn track. This perpetuation of a basic method 
is not necessarily something to be criticised. However, it can be a refreshing 
experience, when a purposeful and competent approach which deviates from 
the established line is encountered.” 
 
Teachers of special relativity make a net distinction between what can 
be derived without using the Lorentz-Einstein transformations and what can 
be  presented  as  a  consequence  of  them.  Peres5  considers  that  “the  Lorentz 
transformation  is  the  standard  way  to  derive  formulas  for  relativistic 
phenomena, such as time dilation, addition of velocities, the Doppler Effect, 
optical  aberration,  etc.  Although  the  derivation  of  these  formulas  is 
straightforward, it is rather formal and not very transparent from the point of 
view of physics.” It is surprising that he doesn’t derive the Lorentz-Einstein 
transformation equations because the formulas he derives could lead directly 
to them.  
 
of relativity expressed in the form of two postulates6: 

While teaching the special relativity we begin by stating the principle 

 

1

1)  The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.  
2)  The  speed  of  light  in  free  space  has  the  same  value  in  all  inertial 

reference frames.  

 

The second statement is redounding.7,8,9 We can add to these postulates two 
direct consequences of the principle of relativity:  

3)  Distances  measured  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  relative  motion 

are the same in all inertial reference frames.10  

4)  The  counted  number  of  stable  objects  (particles)  is  the  same  in  all 

inertial reference frames. 

5)  The  standard  arrangement  of  the  involved  reference  frames  requires 
that  we  initialise  the  clocks  of  the  two  frames  located  at  the 
corresponding  origins,  when  they  are  located at  the  same  point  in 
space.  Figure  1  shows  a  possible  way  in  which  we  can  perform  this 
initialisation.

display the same time at the instant when the vertical axes overlap. 

 
In the first iteration let begin with the standard arrangement of the reference 
frames  and  consider  a  distant  clock  C’  stationary  in  frame  K’  situated  at 
distance  2·d  apart  from  the  horizontal  axes.  In  this  scenario  the  frame  K 
actively  performs  the  initialisation  whereas  the  frame  K’  plays  only  a 
passive  role.  We  admit  that  some  observers  in  frame  K  are  previously 
synchronised and they are able to measure the horizontal speed V of C’ and 
therefore to predict the instant when the clock C’ will reach the vertical axis 
OY in frame K. A light source S stationary in K is pre-programmed to emit a

clocks and set them to display t = t’ = 0. In the second iteration with d(cid:198)0

standard arrangement without any further interfering relativistic effect. 
 
 
wave 
 
We  consider  two  inertial  reference  frames  K(XOY)  and  K’(X’O’Y’) 
in relative motion. The corresponding axes of the two frames are parallel to 
each  other,  the  OX(O’X’)  axes  are  overlapped,  K’  moving  with  constant 
velocity  V  relative  to  K  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  overlapped  axes. 
  are  two  observers  at  rest  in  K  and  K’  respectively. 
)0,0,0(0R
They  are  located  within  the  free  propagation  space  of  a  sinusoidal 
electromagnetic wave (plane or spherical).  These observers detect the same 
positive wave crest of the wave when they are located at the same point in 
space  considered  as  the  origin  of  time.  Both  observers  raise  receiving 
antennas perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation and parallel to 
the  direction  in  which  the  electric  component  of  the  wave  performs  its 
sinusoidal  oscillations.  Under  the  influence  of  the  electric  vector  in  the 
wave, the free electrons in the metallic antenna perform forced oscillations. 
Consequently  the  two  observers  detect  a  harmonic  potential  difference 
between  antenna  ends  having  a  period  that  matches  the  period  of  the 
electromagnetic  oscillations  in  the  wave:  τ∆   as  detected  from  K  and 
respectively  τ′∆  as detected from K’. The two antennas turn into clocks. The 
invariance of the phase11 makes that both observers automatically detect the 
same  oscillation  phase  and  consequently  any  clock  synchronization  is 
superfluous. Counting the same number of positive wave crests n passing in 
 has elapsed, whereas 
front of it the observer 
the  observer 
.  By  definition  τ∆  
and  τ′∆   represent  proper  time  intervals  and  theirs  measurement  doesn’t 
involve previous synchronized clocks. The counting of the wave crests starts 
when the two observers being located at the same point in space detect the 
same  wave  crest.  The  two  observers  detect  the  same  ray  that  propagates 
along  a  direction  θ  when  detected  from  K  but  along  a  direction  θ′  when 
detected  from  K’,  both  angles  being  measured  in  reference  to  the  positive 
  with  the 
direction  of  the  overlapped  axes.  After  a  propagation  time 
speed c, the wave crest generates in frame K the event:

Figure 2. Scenario for deriving the relationship between the changes in the 
readings of two distant clocks at rest relative to each other. 

 
 
Consider  the  experiment  sketched  in  figure  2.  A  ray  of  the 
electromagnetic wave propagates along a directionθ. A positive wave crest 
0R   reads  te.  After  covering  a 
of  it  passes  in  front  of 
distance r the wave crest arrives in front of a clock 
 that reads rt . The 
two readings are related by the obvious equation

The  important  conclusion  is  that  (8)  does  not  depend  on  the  distance 
between the clocks measuring the proper time intervals involved. Equations 
(7)  and  (8)  account  for  the  relativistic  Doppler  Effect.  Equating  the  right

Because  the  Doppler  Effect  is  free  of  distant  clock  synchronization  we 
conclude  that  all  the  relativistic  equations  we  derived  starting  with  the 
Doppler Effect are synchrony free. 
 
3. Conclusions 
 
 
Observers  of  two  inertial  reference  frames  located  within  the 
propagation  space  of  a  harmonic  electromagnetic  wave  transform  suitable 
oriented  antennas  in  clocks  whose  period  equals  the  period  of  the 
electromagnetic  oscillations  in  the  wave.  The  problem  is  reduced  to  two 
observers  located  at  the  origins  of  the  two  frames  respectively.  Because  of 
the invariance of the wave phase both observers detect the same phase of the 
electromagnetic oscillations.  That ensures their synchronization.

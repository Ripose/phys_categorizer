Transformation  equations 
that  characterize  plane 
for  physical  quantities 
electromagnetic  wave  propagation  in  transparent  optical  media  are  presented.  The 
Doppler  effect,  and  measurements  performed  by  an  observer  moving  with  the  wave 
are also considered. The results, not mentioned in introductory Physics textbooks, are 
simple to derive and could be used in undergraduate courses. 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
An electromagnetic wave propagates through empty space with velocity c, the upper 
limit of all physical velocities. It also propagates through non-conducting media with 
velocity

                                                        (1) 

where  n  stands  for  the  refractive  index,  ε  for  the  permittivity  and  µ  for  the 
permeability  of  the  medium.  Because  n>1  and  u<c,  we  can  define  observers  who 
move with velocities equal to or higher than u. We find a similar situation in the case 
of an acoustic wave where observers could move with supersonic velocities.1 
In  the  non-conducting  medium,  we  detect  four  fields:  the  electric  and  the  magnetic 
fields, E and B and the electric displacement and magnetic intensity fields D and H, 
respectively.  The  physical  quantities  introduced  in  order  to  characterize  the  electric 
and the magnetic field (ε,µ) and the fields defined above could have different values 
for different inertial observers in relative motion. 
We  could  characterize  the  electromagnetic  wave  propagating  through  a  medium  by 
the  period  and  the  frequency  of  the  electromagnetic  oscillations  taking  place  in  the 
wave and by its wavelength.  
The  purpose  of  our  paper  is  to  present  a  simple  and  transparent  approach  to  all 
relativistic  aspects  of  electrodynamics  in  material  media.  The  prerequisites  are  a 
knowledge of electricity and magnetism at an introductory level (Lorentz force)2 and 
of the addition law of relativistic velocities3.  
 
2.  Transformation  equations  for  physical  quantities  introduced  in  order  to 
characterize  the  electromagnetic  field  and  the  medium  through  which  it 
propagates 
The  inertial  reference  frames  involved  in  our  approach  are  the  rest  frame  of  the 
medium  K(XOY)  and  a  reference  frame  K'(X'O'Y'),  both  supposed  to  be  inertial. 
Reference frame K'(X'O'Y') moves with constant velocity v in the positive direction of 
the  overlapped  OX  and  O'X'  axes.  The  corresponding  axes  of  the  two  frames  are 
parallel  to  each  other  and,  at  the  origin  of  time,  the  origins  O  and  O'  are  instantly 
located at the same point in space.

We  can  derive  the  addition  law  of  relativistic  velocities  without  using  the  Lorentz-
Einstein  transformations  for  the  space-time  coordinates  of  the  same  event.4,5,6  If  a 
particle moves with velocity u relative to K(XOY) and with velocity u' relative to the 
K'(X'O'Y') reference frame then, in the positive direction of the overlapped OX(O'X') 
axes, special relativity teaches us that equations  

                                                              (2)  

and    

                                                               (3) 

 relate them. It is worthwhile to emphasize that (3) can be obtained by solving (2) for 
u' and vice-versa.  
The considered plane and polarized electromagnetic wave propagates in the positive 
direction of the OX(O'X') axes  with the phase velocities u and u' relative to K and K', 
respectively.  The  vectors  E,B,D  and  H  are  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of 
×D H   are  in  the 
propagation  in  such  a  way  that  the  vector  products 
direction of propagation (Figure 1). In order to illustrate this fact we use the notations 
Ey,Dy,Bz and Hz.  
The law of electromagnetic induction7 leads to the following relationship

 We can say that momentum, electric field and magnetic field intensity are space like 
quantities, whereas energy, electric field displacement and magnetic field are time like 
ones.

4. Doppler Effect in the electromagnetic wave propagating in a medium 
When we speak about a physical quantity, it is advisable to mention the observer who 
performs  the  measurement,  when  and  where  he  performs  the  measurement  and  the 
measuring devices he uses. 
Consider that at the origin of time (t=t’=0) observers 
, the first 
located at the origin O of K(XOY) and at rest relative to it, the second located at the 
origin O' of K'(X'O'Y') and at rest relative to it, are instantly located at the same point 
in  space. At that very moment, the front of the wave arrives at this point. During a 
period T of the electromagnetic oscillations taking place in the wave, the front of the 
wave travels a distance

and in K'(X'O'Y') respectively. Under such conditions, the front of the wave generates

In the experiment described above, the involved observers measure the period of the 
electromagnetic oscillations taking place in the wave and the propagation velocity of

the  wave  and  then  determine  the  wavelength.  The  oscillations  taking  place  in  the 
wave serve as clocks.  
The  division  of  equations  (18),  (19)  and  the  use  of  (16),  (17)  prove  that  the  phase 
velocities add as the velocities of subluminal particles do. 
The transformation factors F and G become in the case of an electromagnetic wave 
propagating in empty space (u=u'=c)

6. The electromagnetic wave propagating through a medium as a velocity filter 
Consider  a  particle  with  positive  electric  charge  q  traveling  with  velocity  w'  in  the 
positive direction of OX(O'X') axes. An electric force acts upon it 
F

                                                               (26)

As we see, if the particle moves with velocity w'=u' it is not deviated from its initial 
direction of motion. Charged particles moving with subluminal velocities (w'<u') are 
deviated  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  O'Y'  axis  whereas  those  moving  with 
superluminal velocities (w'>u') will be deviated in its negative direction. 
 
7. The observer who moves with the wave

F =

The result is that, from the point of view of that observer, all the physical quantities, 
which transform via the factor F are zero. He measures a zero electric field (E'=0), a 
zero magnetic field intensity (H'=0)) but a different from zero magnetic field

7. Conclusions  
We  present  transformation  equations  for  the  physical  quantities,  which  characterize 
the  optical  properties  of  a  transparent  medium  as  well  as  for  the  results  of  the 
measurements performed by observers in relative motion and located in the medium 
through which an electromagnetic wave propagates. The results are simple to derive 
and could be the subject of a workshop in an undergraduate Physics course. 
Results  not  mentioned  in  introductory  Physics  textbooks  are  presented  and  the 

relativistic invariance of 

 is proved. The medium is supposed to be linear, isotropic 

ε
µ

and  homogeneous,  responding  instantaneously  to  the  action  of  the  propagating 
electromagnetic wave.

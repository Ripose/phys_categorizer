Abstract 

The network metaphor in the analysis of urban and territorial cases has a long tradition especially in 
transportation/land-use planning and economic geography. More recently, urban design has brought its con-
tribution by means of the “space syntax” methodology. All these approaches – though under different terms 
like “accessibility”, “proximity”, “integration” “connectivity”, “cost” or “effort” – focus on the idea that some 
places (or streets) are  more important than others because they are  more central. The study of centrality in 
complex systems, however, originated in other scientific areas, namely in structural sociology, well before its 
use in urban studies; moreover, as a structural property of the system, centrality has never been extensively 
investigated metrically in geographic networks as it has been topologically in a wide range of other relational 
networks like social, biological or technological.  

After two previous works on some structural properties of the dual and primal graph representations of 
urban street networks (Porta et al. 2004; Crucitti et al. 2005), in this paper we provide an in-depth investiga-
tion of centrality in the primal approach as compared to the dual one, with a special focus on potentials for 
urban  design.  An  innovative  methodology  for  the  analysis  of  geographic  spatial  networks,  which  we  term 
Multiple Centrality Assessment (MCA), is defined and experimented on four real urban street systems. MCA, 
it turns out, provides a new perspective to the network analysis of spatial systems, which is inherently differ-
ent from space syntax in that: 1. it is based on a primal, rather than a dual, graph representation of street pat-
terns; 2. it works within a fully metric, rather than topologic, framework; 3. it investigates a set of peer cen-
trality indices rather than just a principal one. We show that spatially, some centrality indices nicely capture 
the “skeleton” of the urban structure that so much impacts on spatial cognition and collective behaviors; we 
also show that statistically, centrality distributions consistently characterize geographically different patterns, 
and power laws emerge in self-organized cities. 

1  Introduction: which order for urban street patterns? 

«There is often not as much perfection in works composed of several pieces and made by the hands of 
diverse masters as in those on which one individual alone has worked. […] Thus those ancient cities which, 
having been, in the beginning, only villages, have become, with the passage of time, great towns are ordinar-
ily so badly put together, compared with those regular places which an engineer traces out on a plain accord-
ing to his fantasy, that, even though, considering each one of their edifices separately, one often finds in them 
as much art as, or more of it than, in those of the others, nonetheless, to look at how they are arranged, a big 
one  here,  a  small  one  there,  and  how  they  render  the  streets  crooked  and  unequal,  one  would  say  that  it  is 
chance,  rather  than  the  will  of  a  certain  man  using  reason,  that  has  placed  them  thus»  (Descartes,  1994 
c.1637, p.27). At the dawn of modernity, Descartes firmly defined the Euclidean geometry as the sole kind of 
order acknowledgeable by the eyes of the rational man while dealing with the form of environmental configu-
rations, like gardens, landscapes, streets and cities. Some three centuries later, Le Corbusier brutally reacted 
against Sitte’s recall to the social aesthetics of medieval windy patterns with his well known invective: «La 
rue courbe est le chemin des  ânes, la rue droite le chemin  des Hommes» («The  windy  street is the path of 
asses, the straight street is the path of men», Le Corbusier, 1994 c.1925). Only asses, The Master went on, 
could have designed the historical cities of Europe, with all that mess of narrow streets and that horrible, cha-
otic puzzle of intersections and squares. Still in our days, the power of Euclidean geometry is immensely in-
fluential for architects and urban designers, almost an axiom when it comes to the design of streets, towns and 
cities. Not unlike the urban renewal good old days, still today old neighborhoods are often underestimated in 
their most fundamental values: well, yes, they might be considered picturesque, even attractive due to some 
unique architectural features, but their structure is not that valuable: it is disordered.

Against this modernist stigmatization, a whole stream of counter-arguments have been raised up since 
the early Sixties in the name of the “magic” of old cities (Jacobs, 1993). The claim was not just about aesthet-
ics: it was about livability. The modern city, so it goes, is hard to live in. The social success of an urban set-
tlement,  which  is  conceived  as  the  unpredictable  outcome  of  safety,  trust,  economic  vitality  and  diversity, 
sprouts from the complex, unplanned interactions of countless different routes and experiences in a suitable 
environment.  Warren  Weaver,  quoted  in  Jane  Jacobs  (Jacobs,  1961),  argued  that  science  is  not  just  one 
(Weaver, 1948). To be true, there are many of them. Moreover, science evolves in history. Thus, simple prob-
lems  have  been  investigated  by  a  different  kind  of  science  than  complex-disorganized  ones,  and  complex-
organized  problems  require  a  different  science  again.  Well  –  Jane  Jacobs  said  –  the  point  with  “orthodox” 
planners is that they used the right tools for the wrong problem: cities – she argued – are complex-organized 
problems and as such, in order to be understood, require to be approached with a new science, the science of 
complexity. «Under the seeming disorder of the old city, wherever the old city is working successfully, is a 
marvelous order for maintaining the safety of the streets and the freedom of the city. It is a complex order» 
(Jacobs, 1961, p.50): only by means of the new science of complexity the “marvelous” complex order of the 
old city can be revealed, an order which, unlike the Euclidean geometry, is not visible at a first glance, is not 
imposed  by  any  central  agency,  rather  is  the  result  of  the  fine-grained,  gradual  contribution  of  countless 
agents in time, each following his/her or its own trajectory. That order, Jane Jacobs concluded, is an organic 
one; it is the order of life, the only one that can contribute to the actual livability of neighborhoods and cities, 
thus the one that should drive us to the sustainable city of the future (Newman and Kenworthy, 1999). 

Everyone  knows, in the network community, an area of scientific research that investigates complex 
systems  through  the  use  of  the  metaphor  of  networks  and  the  mathematics  of  graphs,  that  a  good  deal  of 
achievements have been gained in the very last years since the seminal work of Watts and Strogatz on the so-
called “small worlds” in 1998 (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). The availability of detailed maps of a broad range 
of self-organized systems – ranging from natural to man-made, from chemical to biological to neural, sexual 
and even linguistic systems and many others again – as well as an immensely increased computational power, 
have allowed to understand that all those networks do share some astonishingly similar topological properties 
(Barabasi, 2002; Albert and Barabasi, 2002). Among others, our studies on urban street networks (Porta et al. 
2004, Crucitti et al. 2005) – a kind of geographic networks, which are a specific family of complex systems 
characterized by planarity and metric distance – have shown that the same properties actually apply to those 
cases as well. These achievements allow to acknowledge, under the “seeming disorder” of self-organized cit-
ies, the clues of a hidden order that operates embedded in the most diverse climatic, geographic, economic, 
social and cultural conditions, an order shared with most non-geographic natural, biological and social sys-
tems  (Portugali,  2000;  Salingaros,  2003).  The  “marvelous  complex  order”  of  Jane  Jacobs’  old  city,  the 
“magic” of Allan Jacobs’ “great streets”, now appear a little bit less obscure, as we can clearly see behind the 
façade the universal sign of nature, the sign of organic complex systems naturally evolved following a rule of 
preferential  attachment  and  hierarchical  topology  (Albert  and  Barabasi,  2002;  Ravasz  and  Barabasi,  2003). 
The presence of that kind of order, an order that should now be regarded as a value, a treasure, something like 
the  “genius of the city” (Whyte, 1988), qualifies – Warren Weaver  would  say – traditional, self-organized, 
incremental  urban  fabrics  as  a  “complex-organized  problem”:  how  far  is  the  rich,  diverse,  organic,  vital, 
deeply ordered structure of self-organized cities from that kind of chaotic mess that, according to the ingenu-
ous eyes of The Master himself, only asses could have designed! 

That is why the “new science of networks” is so relevant for urban studies today: because the recogni-
tion of the hidden order of self-organized cities is a contribution to the actual overcoming of the modernist 
heritage in city planning and design, as well as to a new set of goals and opportunities for urban designers, 
academics and professionals in the field. In this article we make a step forward in this direction with the iden-
tification and experimentation of a new set of tools for the primal analysis of centralities on urban street sys-
tems. In section 2, a short review of centrality indices since the early Fifties to our days is presented; a com-
parison is then addressed between “space syntax”, a well known methodology for the dual analysis of street 
systems, and previously defined indices of centrality, which leads to understand space syntax under the light 
of a broader framework and to acknowledge its historical roots. In section 3, a brief discussion of the two dif-
ferent approaches – the primal and the dual – to the graph representation of urban street systems is presented: 
special attention is posed to the differences between topologic and geographic distance as well as the impact 
of  the  implementation  of  a  generalization  model  on  the  closeness/integration  centrality  distribution  over  a 
street network. In section 4, selected indices of centrality are investigated over four exemplary real cases of 
urban  street  networks  in  two  ways:  graphically,  by  the  presentation  of  thematic  maps,  and  statistically,  by 
plotting their cumulative distributions; both kinds of investigations are implemented over the primal as well 
as the dual representation of each case. The main message of this article is then presented in section 5 (con-
clusions):  no  single-index  spatial  analysis  can  depict  the  whole  picture:  Multiple  Centrality  Assessment 
(MCA), an innovative process of spatial analysis grounded on a set of different centrality indices investigated

over a truly primal, metric representation of street networks, can better contribute to an extended comprehen-
sion of the “hidden orders” that underlie the structure of real, geographic spatial systems (actually not limited 
to those of streets and intersections). 

 

2  From structural sociology to space syntax: defining centrality indices 

A  classic  in  structural  sociology,  Freeman’s  master-works  on  centrality  (Freeman,  1977,  1979)  re-
viewed and coordinated under the  same roof previous researches addressed since the early  fifties (Bavelas, 
1948, 1950; Leavitt, 1951; Shimbel, 1953; Shaw 1954, 1964), and defined a first set of indices: degree (CD), 
closeness (CC) and betweenness (CB) centrality. The basic idea in structural sociology is to represent a group 
of people in a social or organizational setting as a network whose nodes are the individuals and whose edges 
are  relationships  between  individuals    (Wasserman  and  Faust,  1994).    Bavelas,  was  the  first  to  realize  that 
central individuals in a social network very often play a prominent role in the group, or in other words a good 
location in the network structure corresponds to power in terms of independence, influence an control on the 
others (Bavelas, 1948).  

Quite recently, a new impulse to the use of the network metaphor in the scientific community has come 
from the discovery that complex networks in many different economic, social, natural and man-made systems 
do share some common structural properties. A first shared property is related to distance and clustering: in 
fact, it has been shown that most of those networks exhibit the “small-world” property, meaning that the av-
erage topological distance between couples of nodes is small compared to the size of the network (it increases 
only logarithmically with the system’s size), despite the fact that the network exhibits a large local clustering 
typical of regular lattices (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). A second shared property is more related to centrality, 
and in particular has to do with the node’s degree distribution. The degree k of a node is defined as the num-
ber of its connections and, as we will see in the following, it is nothing else than a node’s centrality measure, 
CD. The study of a large number of complex systems, including networks as diverse as man-made like World 
Wide Web and the Internet (Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani, 2004), social like the movie actors collaboration 
network  or  networks  of  sexual  contacts  (Liljeros  et  al.  2001),  and  many  biological  (Albert  and  Barabasi, 
2002), has shown that, in most of  them the degree distribution follows, for large degree k, a power law scal-
ing:

( ) ~

(5) 

with the exponent γ being between 2 and 3. In this formula, N(k) is the number of nodes having k links, and 
P(k) is N(k) divided by the total number of nodes in the network. Networks with such a degree distribution 
have  been  named  scale-free  (Albert  and  Barabasi,  2002).  The  results  found  are  particularly  interesting  be-
cause  in  contrast  with  what  expected  for  random  graphs  (Erdös  and  Rényi,  1959).  In  fact,  a  random  graph 
with N nodes and K edges (an average of  k per node), i.e. a graph obtained by randomly selecting the K cou-
ples of nodes to be the connected, exhibits a Poisson degree distribution centred at   k , with an exponential 
and not a power law behaviour for large values of k. 

In formal terms, a network can be represented as a graph G=(Ν, Κ), a mathematical entity defined by a 
pair of sets, Ν and Κ. The first set, Ν , is a nonempty set of N elements called nodes or points, while Κ  is a 
set of K elements containing unordered pairs of different nodes called links or edges. In the following a node 
will be referred to by its order i in the set Ν (1≤  i ≤ N). If there is an edge between nodes i and j, the edge be-
ing indicated as (i,j), the two nodes are said to be adjacent or connected. Some times it is useful to consider a 
valued, or weighted graph G=(Ν, Κ, Ω ), defined by three pairs of sets Ν , Κ and Ω. The set Ω  is a set of K 
elements being the numerical values attached to the edges, and measuring the strengths of the tight. A graph 
G=(Ν, Κ) can be described by a single matrix, the so-called adjacency matrix A={aij}, a NxN square matrix 
whose element aij is equal to 1 if (i,j) belongs toΚ, and zero otherwise. A weighted graph G=(Ν, Κ, Ω ) is de-
fined by giving two matrices, the adjacency  matrix A, defined as above,  and a matrix W containing the edge 
weights. In our particular case, we find more useful to work with lengths in place of weights, so that, instead 
of the  weights  matrix  W  we  will consider the lengths  matrix  L={lij}, a 
 matrix  whose entry lij is the 
metric length of the street connecting i and j, i.e. a quantity inversely proportional to the weight associated to 
the edge. In a valued graph, the shortest path length dij between i and j is defined as the smallest sum of the 
edges lengths throughout all the possible paths in the graph from i to j, while in a non-valued graph it is sim-
ply given by smallest number of steps in order to go  from i to j. 

NN ×

The  characteristic  path  length  L  (Watts  and  Strogatz,  1998),  is  defined  as  the  average  length  of  the 

shortest paths calculated over all the couples of nodes in the network:

is a good measure of the connectivity properties of the network. However this index is not well defined for 
non-connected graphs, unless we make the artificial assumption of a finite value for dij also when there is no 
path connecting nodes i and j. To overcome this problem a new index of performance has been defined: the 
global efficiency Eglob (Latora and Marchiori, 2001). As the characteristic path length, Eglob  is a measure of 
how well the nodes communicate over the network and  is defined based on the efficiency in the communica-
tion  between  couples  of  nodes.  The  efficiency  εij  in  the  communication  between  two  generic  nodes  of  the 
graph i and j, is assumed to be inversely proportional to the shortest path length, i.e. εij=1/dij. In the case G is 
non-connected and there is no path linking i and j it is assumed dij=+∞ and, consistently, εij=0. The global 
efficiency of a graph G is defined as the average of εij over all the couples of nodes:

The global efficiency is correlated to 1/L, since a  high characteristic path length corresponds to a low effi-
ciency. By definition, in the topologic (non valued graph) case, Eglob takes values in the interval [0,1], and is 
equal to 1 for the complete graph (a graph with all the possible, N(N-1)/2 edges). In metric systems (translated 
into valued graphs), however, it is possible to normalize (Latora and Marchiori, 2001) such a quantity  divid-
ing Eglob(G) by the efficiency Eglob(Gideal) of an ideal complete system in which the edge connecting the ge-
neric couple of nodes i-j is present and has a length equal to the Euclidean distance between i and j:

The three indices of centrality reported in (Freeman 1977, 1979) can be roughly divided into two dif-
ferent families (Latora e Marchiori, 2004). CD refers to being central as having a lot of people right at hand (a 
lot of “first neighbours”), while CC refers to being central as minimizing the distance to all other people in 
the group: thus, both can be seen as belonging to the same concept of being central as being near the others 
(Shimbel, 1953; Sabidussi, 1966, Nieminen, 1974; Freeman 1977, 1979; Scott, 2003). On the other hand, CB 
measures being central as being between the others, i.e. being the intermediary in many of the relationships 
that  link  all  other  persons  each  other  in  the  group  (Anthonisse,  1971;  Freeman  1977,  1979;  Freeman  et  al. 
1991; Newman and Girvan, 2003). After a number of revisions and applications through a good four decades 
(Bonacich, 1972, 1987, 1991; Stephenson and Zelen, 1989; Altman, 1993), such indices have been changed 
and extended to different cases, but the basic families have not been changed as much. In transportation plan-

 

4

ning, for instance, the accessibility of a place is still intended as its “ability” to be shortly accessed from all 
other places, which is in essence – beside distance being measured by a much more complex notion of trans-
portation cost – a kind of CC. 

The  growth  of  interest  for  the  network  analysis  of  complex  systems,  an  interest  that  has  deeply  in-
volved  physicists  and  mathematicians,  new  indices  of  centrality  have  been  recently  proposed.  For  the  pur-
poses of this article three of them, namely efficiency, straightness and information centrality, all based on the 
previously illustrated measure of global efficiency (Latora and Marchiori, 2001), are of particular relevance. 
The efficiency centrality CE, which is in essence a closeness, once applied to properly geographic graphs and 
normalized  by  comparing  the  length  of  shortest  paths  with  that  of  virtual  straight  lines  between  the  same 
nodes (Vragovìc et al. 2004),  turns out to capture a totally new, inherently geographic concept of centrality 
that we can term straightness centrality and is denoted as CS: being central as being more straightfully reach-
able by all others in the network. The other index, namely the information centrality CI (Latora and Marchi-
ori, 2004), in its two-steps computational process embeds both CC and CB in a single quantity, leading to an-
other distinct concept of being central as being critical for all others as a group. In the following, we offer 
the formal mathematical definition and a more detailed discussion of the mentioned  families of centrality in-
dices. 

2.1 Being near the others: Degree and Closeness centrality 

Degree centrality is based on the idea that important nodes have the largest number of ties to other nodes in 
the graph. The degree of a node is, as previously mentioned, the number of edges incident with the node, i.e. 
ik of node i is defined in terms of the adjacency ma-
the number of first neighbours of the node. The degree 

. The degree centrality (CD) of i is defined as (Nieminen, 1974; Freeman, 1979):

The normalization adopted is such that CD takes on values between 0 and 1, and  is equal to one in the case in 
which a node is connected to all the other nodes of the graph. Degree centrality is not particularly relevant in 
primal urban networks where a node’s degree (the number of streets incident in that node) are limited by geo-
graphic constraints.  

The simplest notion of closeness is based on the concept of minimum distance or geodesic dij, that is, 
as already  mentioned,  the smallest sum of the edges lengths throughout all the possible paths in the graph 
from i to j in a weighted graph, and reduces to the minimum number of edges traversed, in a topologic graph.  
The closeness centrality of point i (Sabidussi, 1966; Freeman, 1979; Wasserman and Faust, 1994) is:

where Li is the average distance from actor i  to all the other actors. CC is to be used when measures based 
upon  independence  are  desired  (Freeman,  1979).  Such  an  index  is  meaningful  for  connected  graphs  only, 
unless one artificially assumes dij equal to a finite value when there is no path between two nodes i and j, and 
takes on values between 0 and 1 in the case of non valued graphs.  

2.2 Being between the others: Betweenness centrality 

Interactions between two non-adjacent points might depend on the other actors, especially on those on 
the paths between the two. Therefore points in the middle can have a strategic control and influence on the 
others. The important idea at the base of this centrality index is that an actor is central if it lies between many 

  

 

5

of the other actors. This concept can be simply quantified  by assuming that the communication travels just 
along  geodesics.  Namely,  if  njk  is  the  number  of  geodesics  linking  the  two  actors  j  and  k,  and  njk  (i)  is  the 
number of geodesics linking the two actors j and k that contain point i, the betweenness centrality of actor i 
can be defined as (Freeman, 1979):

i takes on values between 0 and 1, and it reaches its maximum when actor i falls on all geodesics.  There 
are several extensions to the index of betweenness proposed by Freeman. In particular,  for all the cases in 
which  the  communication  does  not  travel  through  geodesic  paths  only,  a  more  realistic  betweenness  index 
should include non-geodesic as well as geodesic paths. Here we just mention two of the indices of between-
ness  that  include  contributions  from  non-geodesic  paths:  the  flow  betweenness  and  the  random  paths  be-
tweenness, although in our study we will only deal with the simplest case, i.e. the shortest-path betweeenness 
defined in formula (8).  

2.3 Being straight to the others: Efficiency and Straightness centrality 

Efficiency and straightness centralities originate from the idea that the efficiency in the communication 
between two nodes i and j is equal to the inverse of the shortest path lenght dij (Latora and Marchiori, 2001). 
In particular, the efficiency centrality of node i is defined as: 

where  

Eucl

 is the Euclidean distance between nodes i and j along a straight line. 

ijd

The straightness centrality is a variant of the efficiency centrality, that originates from a different nor-

malization (Vragovìc et al. 2004). The straightness centrality of node i is defined as:

This measure captures to which extent the connecting route between nodes i and j deviates from the virtual 
straight route.  

2.4 Being critical for all the others: Information centrality 

Information centrality is based on the idea that the importance of a node is related to the ability of the 
network to respond to the deactivation of that node from the network. In particular, we measure the network 
ability in propagating information among its points, before and after a certain node is deactivated.

The information centrality of a node i is defined as the relative drop in the network efficiency caused 

by the removal from G of the edges incident in i:

where by G’ we indicate a network with N points and K-ki edges obtained by removing from G the edges in-
cident in the node i. Here we use the efficiency of Eq. 4. However, a generic performance parameter can be 
used in place of it. The removal of some of the edges affects the communication between various points of the 
graph increasing the length of the shortest paths. Consequently the efficiency of the new graph Eglob,2(G’) is 
smaller than E glob,2 (G) and the index CI
i is normalized by definition to take values in the interval [0,1]. It is 
immediate to see that CI

2.5 Space syntax in the field of centrality: integration and CC 

The network approach has been broadly used in urban studies. Since the early sixties, a lot of research 
has been spent trying to link the allocation of land uses to population growth through lines of transportation 
(Wilson,  2000),  or  seeking  the  prediction  of  transportation  flows  given  several  topological  and  geometric 
characteristics of traffic channels (Larson, 1981), or eventually investigating the exchanges of goods and hab-
its  between  settlements  in  the  geographic  space  even  in  historical  eras  (Pitts,  1965,  1979;  Peregrine,  1991; 
Byrd,  1994).  Urban  design  as  a  discipline,  beside  some  few  theoretical  efforts  (Batty  and  Longley,  1994; 
Alexander, 1998; Salingaros, 1998) has not contributed that much to the picture in direct operational terms, 
with one quite relevant exception: after the seminal work of Hillier and Hanson (Hillier and Hanson, 1984), a 
rather consistent application of the network approach to cities, neighbourhoods, streets and even single build-
ings,  has been developed under the notion of  “space syntax”, establishing a significant  correlation between 
the topological accessibility of streets and phenomena as diverse as their popularity (pedestrian and vehicular 
flows), human way-finding, safety against micro-criminality, retail commerce vitality, activity separation and 
pollution (Penn and Turner, 2003). Though not limited to just one index, the core of the space syntax meth-
odology, when applied to street networks, is the index of integration, which is stated to be «so fundamental 
that it is probably in itself the key to most aspects of human spatial organization» (Hillier, 1996, p.33). The 
integration of one street has been defined as the «shortest journey routes between each link (or a space) and 
all of the other  in the  network (defining  ‘shortest’ in  terms of fewest changes  in direction)» (Hillier, 1998, 
p.36). As such, integration turns out to be nothing else than a normalized CC (Jiang and Claramunt, 2004b), 
the  well  known closeness centrality index defined since the early  fifties by structural sociologists –  who in 
fact dealt with topological networks as well – and reviewed by Freeman in the late Seventies. A short com-
parison between formal definitions of integration – Hillier and Hanson, (1984), ch.3, p.108; Teklenburg et al. 
(1993), p.350; Hillier, (1996), p.36, note 16; Jiang and Claramunt, (2002), p.298-299, and many others – and 
that of CC presented above in section 2.1, Eq. 7, fully confirms the assumption. 

 

 

3  Primal vs. dual in the construction of 1-square-mile cases of urban street networks: 

metric distance, CC spatial distribution and the edge-effect  

The network analysis, when applied to territorial cases, has mostly followed a primal approach, where 
intersections (or settlements) are turned into nodes and streets (or relationships) into edges. That representa-
tion seems to be the most intuitive for networks characterized by a strong connection to the geographic di-
mensions, which is to say networks where distance has to be measured not just in topological terms (steps) – 
like, for instance in social systems – but rather in properly spatial terms (meters, miles), like in urban street 
systems. Traffic engineers as well as economic geographers or even geo-archeologists have mostly, if not al-
ways, followed the primal approach. The primal approach is also the world-standard to geo-spatial datasets 
construction and diffusion, to the point that to date an immense amount of information has been already mar-

 

7

keted  following  the  embedded  road-centerline-between-nodes  rule,  like  in  the  huge  TIGER  (Topologically 
Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing) database developed at the U.S. Census Bureau; that rule, 
in fact, opens to the qualification of street/edges with  weights of different kinds, i.e. traffic flows, transport 
costs, metric distance and the like. 

It might appear paradoxical, though, that space syntax, the flagship application of urban design to the 
network analysis of city spaces, did follow the opposite direction, being based on a dual representation of ur-
ban street patterns. In this representation, axial lines that represent generalized streets (more exactly: “lines of 
sight” or “lines of unobstructed movement” along mapped streets) are turned into nodes, and intersections be-
tween each pair of axial lines into edges. Shortcomings as well as benefits of this approach have been often 
remarked (Desyllas and Duxbury, 2001; Jiang and Claramunt, 2002; Batty, 2004a,b; Ratti, 2004; Hillier and 
Penn, 2004; Porta et al. 2004).  For the purposes of this article, we just focus on the questions of distance and 
on the impacts of the two approaches on the spatial distribution of CC.  

In the process of building the dual graph,  which  means reducing streets into  nodes,  what gets lost is 
something very relevant, beside its somehow questionable importance for the human cognitive experience of 
spaces (Penn, 2003), for any human sensorial experience of space (Hall, 1966): distance. No matter its real 
length, one street  will be represented in the dual  graph as  one point. Moreover, as long as a  generalization 
model is run and the “identity” of one real street is extended over a conceptually unlimited number of real in-
tersections, in the dual graph it is possible to find one node (street) with a conceptually unlimited number of 
edges  (intersections),  a  number  which  heavily  depends  on  the  actual  length  of  the  street  itself.  Thus,  the 
longer the street in reality, the more central (by degree) it is likely to be in the dual graph, which counters the 
experiential concept of accessibility that is conversely related to how close (i.e. in real metric distance) is the 
destination to all origins, like in transportation models. Another consequence of the dual reduction of streets 
into  points  is  that  it  makes  impossible  to  account  for  the  variations  which  so  often  characterize  one  single 
street, variations that  may easily become  very  significant  for lengthy streets that cross  wide – and possibly 
quite different in structural terms – urban areas; this is the case, for instance, of the via Etnea in Catania, Sic-
ily, a roughly 3 kilometres long perfectly straight XVII century street that runs from the baroque city core to 
the  countryside  beneath  the  Etna  volcano,  a  street  that  presents  radically  different  social,  economic,  demo-
graphic and environmental settings while crossing seemingly all possible urban landscapes on Earth.  

Finally, in more structural terms, metric distance has been recognized as the key feature of road net-
works, which exactly because of that do need to be dealt with as a new, specific family of networks (Gastner 
and Newman, 2004); the crucial nature of geographic-Euclidean distance at the core of such systems leads to 
other key features, namely the planar nature and the extremely reduced variance of node’s degree, whose dis-
tribution could never recall, and does not, any particular scale-free behavior. However, processed through the 
dual representation and a generalization model, the same road network gets freed of such limitations: the loss 
of any limitation to the degree of a node in the dual graph, which comes because the dual node represents one 
generalized real street and any generalized real street might cross a conceptually unlimited number of other 
real streets, makes the dual generalized streets systems structurally analogous to all other topological systems 
recently investigated in other fields, which in fact do not exhibit any geographic constrain; that leads, for in-
stance, to the recognition of broad scaling rules in the degree distribution (Jiang and Claramunt, 2004a; Ros-
vall et al. 2004). The same scaling rules emerge for both the degree and the clustering coefficient C(k) distri-
butions of dually represented generalized streets networks of significant size (Porta et al, 2004), the sign of a 
hierarchical  structure  that  has  been  recognized  as  a  distinct  property  of  non-geographic  real  cases,  i.e.  net-
works where the metric length of edges simply does not matter in any sense (Ravasz and Barabasi, 2003).  

Hence,  the  dual  representation  associated  with  a  generalization  model  –  the  two  pillars  of  the  space 
syntax  castle  –  actually  push  urban  street  systems,  in  strict  structural  terms,  out  of  the  geographic  domain. 
Though other means can be investigated in order to introduce the geographic distance on such a dual repre-
sentation (Salheen and Forsyth, 2001, Salheen, 2003, Batty, 2004b), if a central role to geographic distance 
has to be recognized in a straight and plain manner, the primal road-centerline-between-nodes representation 
of street patterns, where intersections are nodes and streets are (weighted) edges, evidently appears the most 
valuable option.  

The “metric problem” that so deeply differentiates the primal and the dual representations of street sys-
tems,  heavily  impacts  on  both  the  way  to  capture  the  behavior  of  centrality  measures  on  networks  and  the 
way networks themselves are represented into graphs. Recently, we pioneered a systematic evaluation of the 
distributions of different centrality indices over eighteen 1-square-mile samples of urban fabrics drawn from a 
previous work of Allan Jacobs (Jacobs, 1993), in a pure geographic framework (Crucitti et al. 2005). Four of 
those  cases  (fig.  1),  namely  Ahmedabad  (IN),  Venice  (IT),  Richmond  and  Walnut  Creek  (CA),  are  hereby 
deepened in order to frame the opposition between the primal and the dual approach to the newtork analysis 
of street systems.

                              Fig.  1 

Four  1-square-mile  cases  of  urban  patterns  as  they 
appear  in  original  maps  (a-d,  top),  reduced  to  primal 
road-centreline-between-nodes  graphs  (a-d,  middle), 
and  dual  generalized  graphs  (a-d,  bottom).  Two  of 
them  (a.  Ahmedabad;  b.  Venice)  are  mostly  self-
organized patterns, while the others (c. Richmond; d. 
Walnut Creek) are mostly planned patterns. However, 
all  cases  are  striking  different  after  all  other 
economic,  historical,  cultural,  functional  and  geo-
climatic  conditions  are  considered.  In  particular, 
Ahmedabad  is  a  densely  interwoven,  uninterrupted 
urban fabric while Venice is dominated by the Grand 
Canal  separation  which  is  over  passed  in  just  two 
points (the Rialto and Accademia bridges); moreover, 
Richmond  shows  a  traditional  grid-iron  structure 
while Walnut Creek a conventional  “lollipop” layout 
typical  of  post-war  suburbs.  Those  geographic 
peculiarities,  which  are  well  featured  in  the  primal 
valued  (metric)  representation,    get  lost  in  the  dual, 
where just the topologic properties of the systems are 
retained.

Moreover, while Ahmedabad and Venice are typical self-organized patterns, in that they are mostly the 
outcome  of  a  gradual,  fine-grained  development  through  history  out  of  the  control  of  any  central  agent, 
Richmond and Walnut Creek are examples of planned fabrics, developed under the directions of one central 
agent in a relatively short period of time. 

 In this work on 1-sq.mile samples of urban street systems (fig.1a-d, top) both the primal and the dual 
approaches  have  been  performed  and  compared.  In  the  primal  approach  centrality  scores  are  calculated  on 
nodes over the primal graphs.  Primal graphs (fig. 1a-d, middle) are constructed following a road-centerline-
between-nodes rule: real intersections are turned into graph nodes and real streets into graph edges; all graph 
edges are defined by two nodes (the endpoints of the arc) and, possibly, several vertexes (intermediate points 
of linear discontinuity); intersections among edges are always located at nodes; edges follow the footprint of 
real streets as they appear on maps. All distances have been calculated metrically in geographic space: so the 
distance between two nodes (intersections) is not – say – 3 steps (which is: through 3 intermediate nodes), but 
rather  –  say  –    452.38  metres.  After  the  calculation  of  centrality  scores  on  primal  nodes,  analogous  primal 
layouts (red/blue maps) are produced with reference either to node or edge centrality; in this latter case, be-
cause in the primal graph one edge is defined by just one pair of ending nodes by which the edge “partici-
pates” to the topology of the network as a whole, the centrality of one edge is simply equated to the average 
of the centralities of its defining pair of nodes. An example of node-referenced layout is given in fig. 2, while 
in fig. 3a an edge-referenced layout is offered: both are the result of the same pure primal approach. 

In the dual approach centrality scores are calculated on nodes over the dual graph (fig.1a-d bottom) af-
ter the implementation of a generalization model, in this case the Intersection Continuity Negotiation (ICN) 
model  (Porta  et  al.  2004),  which  emphasizes  the  straightness  bias  in  collective  wayfinding  at  intersections 
(Conroy Dalton, 2003; Thomson, 2004).  Here, generalized streets are turned into nodes and intersections into 
edges  of  the  dual  graph;  the  distance  between  two  nodes  (streets)  is  equated  to  the  number  of  intervening 
edges  (intersections)  along  the  shortest  connecting  path:  it  is  a  topologic,  non-metric  concept  of  distance 
which accounts for how many “steps” is one node from another, no matter the length of those steps. Then, 
primal layouts (red/blue maps) are produced where, because nodes in the dual graphs represent generalized 
streets, the centrality scores of a dual node are associated to the corresponding generalized street in the primal 
layout.  Beside  some  dissimilarities,  including  a  different  generalization  model  (ICN  instead  of  axial  map-
ping), this follows the same approach of space syntax. 

Before the analysis of different centrality indices, which is being presented in next sections, it is worth 
spending a little reflection on the sole closeness centrality CC, the integration normalized index at the core of 
space syntax. Implemented on primal graphs (fig. 3a), the spatial distribution of CC is dominated by the so-
called “edge-effect”, in that higher CC scores consistently group around the geometric center of the image. To 
some extent less evident in less dense cases like Walnut Creek, the edge-effect is overwhelming in denser ur-
ban fabric like those of  Ahmedabad and Venice. However, in all cases the edge-effect affects CC spatial dis-
tributions enough to disable the emergence of both central routes and focal spots in the city fabric, a crucial 
feature for urban analysis, so that  it leads to meaningless results. 

While  the  edge-effect  dominates  the  primal  representation,  it  is  somehow  minimized  in  the  dual  ap-
proach (fig. 3b), due to the combined impact of both the loss of metrics and, on the other side, the generaliza-
tion model that makes streets less fragmented. Here we can see that the generalization model actually holds a 
vital role in that it allows to limit, to some extents, the edge-effect. How can it do that? Because by means of 
the generalization model the identification of continuous routes across the urban fabric is performed before 
the analysis of centrality rather than being one of its outcomes. As such, the analysis of centrality will give 
results that cannot avoid to be deeply affected by principles that do not belong to any concept of centrality, 
but instead belong to the algorithm embedded in the generalization model (straightness at intersections in the 
ICN, uninterrupted linearity – or visibility – in axial mapping). Thus our dual analysis, like that of space syn-
tax, can be referred to as the combined result of two diverse and autonomous rationales, the first that drives 
the generalization process and the second that drives the spatial distribution of centrality. This finding con-
firms a previous  work  where  a conventional  space syntax  dual analysis, applied  without any  generalization 
model on a segmentally represented street network, has been found misleading for the overwhelming impact 
of the edge-effect (Dalton et al. 2003). Again, this is not due to some hidden structure of the urban phenome-
non: it is due to the inherent character of the chosen index: integration, or CC, is quite a lot affected by the 
edge-effect due to its deep same nature, and does not lead by itself to any legible description of urban routes 
or focal areas.

In  the  light  of  this  evidence,  one  has  two  options.  The  first  option:  you  can  insist  with  the  dual  ap-
proach and stress to its limits the empowerment of the generalization model, i.e. by means of more automa-
tion (Batty and Rana, 2002; Dalton et al. 2003) or new principles of street identity (Penn et al. 1997; Jiang 
and Claramunt, 2000; 2004b); Batty and Rana (2002) have found a good  9 different methodologies for axial 
mapping  to  date,  each  generating  a  different  result  from  the  others,  all  exhibiting  substantially  single  scale 
length distributions. Also the edge effect can actually be minimized on dual graph by artificially widening the 
study area in order to leave the most edge-effected parts out of the picture, which seems a scarcely efficient – 
though truly effective – solution. The second option: you can embrace a pure primal approach, riveting every-
thing to geographic metric distances weighted on a road-centerline-between-nodes world standard; this latter 
option would allow to reach a much finer characterization of (even longest) streets; it would let you abandon 
the generalization models, with a relevant advantage in process efficiency, objectivity and legibility; it also 
would open to endless, already marketed and constantly updated information resources; finally, it would lead 
to a great enhancement in the realism of calculations and representations, in that it pairs the topology of the 
system with its metric, thus comprehending both the cognitive and the proxemic dimension of collective be-
haviors in space. Striking benefits, as everyone can see. But there are one problem and one question.  

 

 

Fig.  2 

The primal approach: CC spatial distribution in Ahmedabad: centrality  scores are calculated on the nodes of the primal 
weighted  graph  (fig.  1a,  middle)  where  weights  are  edges’  metric  lengths.  In  this  figure  red/blue  maps  have  been 
anchored  to  nodes’  centrality,  while  in  others  (fig.  3a)  they  have  been  referred  to  edges’  centrality  as  the  average 
centrality of its defining nodes. (a) Global Closeness: CC is calculated on the whole network; (b) local Closeness: CC is 
calculated on the sub-network of nodes at distance d < 400 meters from each node; (c) local Closeness: CC is calculated 
on the sub-network of nodes at distance d < 200 meters from each node. The CC index, performed globally over the whole 
network (see also fig. 3a, case 1), exhibits an overwhelming sensibility to the edge effect that makes it almost meaningless 
for urban analysis. However, performed locally (b) and (c), CC maintains a good descriptive potential, but it captures only 
local properties. The problem of the edge-effect with the global measure is partially corrected in the dual graph (fig. 3b, 
case  1)  due  to  its  topologic  nature  and  the  implementation  of  a  generalisation  model.  However,  beside  just  partially 
solving  the  problem,  this  correction  seems  artificial  in  that  it  cannot  account  for  variations  of  centrality  along  lengthy 
streets;  moreover,  it  is  heavily  dependent  on  the  rationale  of  the  generalization  model,  that  has  nothing  to  do  with 
centrality. 

 
The problem: as  we  have just shown,  the  CC/integration index simply does  not  work on such primal 
graphs. It does not reveal any order in the graph, it just “reveals” the center of the image. But CC is not all: 
centrality is a multifold concept and we have many indices at hand. Thus, to overcome this problem we can 
limit the analysis of CC to a local scale, where it maintains a good potential (fig. 2), and simply begin with 
testing other centrality indices – like the mentioned CB, CS and CI – that refer to different concepts of being 
central. That is what we basically do hereby; a review of our findings and a comparison with an application 
on dual graphs is offered in the next section. The question: is the primal approach to street systems, because 
of the inherent limitation of the CD range of variance to scores mostly included between 3 and 6 (roughly the 
number of streets per intersection in real urban patterns), getting the whole reflection unsuitable to the more 
general stream of the network analysis of complex real-world systems? Again, CD is not all as well: we will 
show that once the analysis of the statistical distribution of centrality over the network is extended from the 
sole CD to the other centrality indices, consistent scaling behaviors come to light that provide a much deeper 
insight  in  the  complex  nature  of  real  street  networks  (and  more  in  general  of  geographic  systems).  So,  the 
evaluation of multiple centrality concepts and measures, it turns out, is the key for being able to both perform 

 

11

a pure primal road-centerline-between-nodes spatial analysis (with all its benefits) and, on the other side, re-
enter the network analysis of geographic systems into the mainstream of the “new sciences of networks”. 

 

4  The spatial and statistical distributions of centrality indices 

Differences and correlations among the many indices of centrality in social networks have been inves-
tigated in a significant flurry of literature over the last decades (Cook et al. 1983; Donninger, 1986; Bolland, 
1988;  Markovsky  et  al.  1988;  Nakao,  1990;  Mullen  at  al.  1991;  Rothenberg  et  al.  1995;  Bell  et  al.  1999; 
Poulin et al. 2000; see for a review: Wasserman and Faust, 1994); the goal was to understand the real nature 
of those indices when applied on human groups or organizations. The implementation of centrality indices on 
territory-related cases – though not always  geographic –  has been, to this respect,  much  less experimented, 
with some exceptions in different and sometimes unexpected fields (Pitts, 1965, 1979; Irwin-Williams, 1977; 
Irwin, 1978; Rothman, 1987; Peregrine, 1991; Byrd, 1994; Smith and Timberlake, 1995; Faust et al. 1999). In 
space  syntax,  for  instance,  the  link  between  the  CC/integration  core-index  (as  well  as  the  ancillary 
CD/connectivity index) and centralities in social networks has been only very recently acknowledged (Jiang 
and Claramunt, 2004b) and never really deepened, thus there is apparently  no comparative evaluation  with 
other families of centrality indices. Our studies on 1-square-mile samples of urban street networks applied in 
a pure primal, geographic framework (Crucitti et al. 2005) reveal that the four families of centrality, “being 
near” (CC), “being between” (CB), “being straight” (CS) and “being critical” (CI) exhibit highly diverse spatial 
distribution  patterns  (fig.  3a).  In  this  sense,  two  conclusions  occur:  on  one  hand,  no  single  index  gives  the 
whole picture, as they tell striking different stories: in fact, they capture different aspects of one place’s “be-
ing central” in geographic space; on the other hand, CI emerges as the most comprehensive single index of the 
whole set, gathering properties of two different families of centrality out of the remaining three that we have 
taken into consideration. More in detail, CC (performed globally) fails in individuating a hierarchy of central 
routes or areas and is of no help in urban analysis;  CB is mostly effective in letting centrality emerge along 
even lengthy urban routes  while still being affected, to some extents, by the edge-effect; CS gives the  most 
unexpected  results,  mapping  areas  of  higher  centrality  as  well  as  central  routes,  with  no  sensibility  to  the 
edge-effect; CI nicely capture the criticality of edges that play a “bridging” role in keeping the network con-
nected, at the same time partially retaining the behavior of CB. In general, the particular effectiveness of the 
analysis to account for the variations in centrality levels within the same route, like in the case of CB in Ven-
ice, CS in Ahmedabad or CI in Richmond, should be highlighted: even more so if considered that those routes 
are a result of the “natural” emergence of a pattern of centrality across a plurality of street segments, without 
any hexogen intervention of rationales of a different kind like that of a generalization model: as such, MCA 
suggests that centrality can play a distinct role in the “organic” formation of a “skeleton” of mostly practiced 
routes as the cognitive framework for wayfinding in a complex urban environment (Kuipers et al. 2003).  

In fig. 3b an analogous assessment over a dual representation of the same cases is presented, after the 
implementation of the ICN generalization model (Porta et al. 2004). The analysis of CC gives a good result 
(see for instance the case of Ahmedabad) but still affected by the edge-effect as the street pattern, like in Ven-
ice,  gets  more  fragmented.  The  ICN-driven  construction  of  generalized  streets,  which  is  preliminary  to  the 
process of centrality calculation, deeply affects the final results in all cases, leading to a more artificial picture 
of real systems and to a less differentiated information among indices. While in the primal approach continu-
ous routes or sub-areas emerge in the urban fabric as a result of the natural “convergence” of centrality over a 
chain of single streets across a number of intersections, in the dual we have routes that are identified before 
centrality enters the scene, and then attributed a value of centrality. That leads to less univocal results, in that 
it is impossible to understand whether a certain part of a route is really as central or it just “inherits” its cen-
trality from others of its parts. All this turns out in a sort of artificial interpretation of the street network.  

Moreover, the statistical analysis of centrality distributions on primal graphs (fig. 4, top) confirms that 
the cumulative distributions of CC, CB, CS and CI consistently follow characteristic scaling rules: here, like in 
all samples considered in Crucitti et al. (2005),  we have  found that  CC and CS are  mainly linear;  CB, being 
well fitted by a straight line in a log-linear scale, follows an exponential distribution; CI differentiates planned 
from self-organized cities following an exponential distribution in the former case and a power-law in the lat-
ter one. In fig. 4a we report the distribution of centrality indices for Ahmedabad and Richmond, representa-
tive examples of self-organized and planned cities respectively. Homogeneity/heterogeneity in the allocation 
of  the  centrality  “resource”  among  nodes,  investigated  by  the  application  of  the  Gini  coefficient  (Dagum, 
1980), have demonstrated to be sufficient for a broad classification of different cities through a cluster analy-
sis, that groups together cities with similar urban patterns (Crucitti et al. 2005). This confirms that, by means 
of  the  primal  representation  and  a  set  of  different  centrality  indices,  it  is  possible  to  capture  basic  crucial 
properties of real urban streets systems for an appropriate classification of cities.

the  four 

indices  of  centrality  (CC=Closeness;  CB=Betweenness;  CS=Straightness  and 
The  primal  approach: 
CI=Information) calculated over  four cases (1.  Ahmedabad; 2. Venice; 3. Richmond; 4. Wallnut Creek) represented by 
primal  graphs  (intersections  are  nodes,  streets  are  edges).  In  the  primal  approach,  centrality  scores  are  calculated 
metrically on nodes, that represent real intersections; then, they can be represented in red/blue layouts as referred to nodes 
or, like in this figure, to edges: in this latter case, each edge is assigned a centrality score equal to the average score of its 
pair of nodes, through which the edge participates to the topology of the whole network. The analysis shows that CC is by 
far  the  less  interesting  measure  of  centrality,  lacking  any  capacity  to  identify  central  routes  or  sub-areas  in  the  urban 
pattern due to the overwhelming impact of the edge-effect. Conversely, the three other indices consistently capture the 
different  “natures”  of  being  central.  Moreover,  they  exhibit  a  strong  capacity  to  identify  routes  or  sub-areas  of  higher 
centrality in the most diverse topologic conditions. Thus, that identification is an outcome of the sole centrality analysis: 
in short, we see here how centrality “builds” different routes or spots in the urban fabric, whose identity is a function of 
their qualification in terms, again, of “pure” centrality.

The dual approach: the four indices of centrality (CC=Closeness; CB=Betweenness; CS=Straightness and CI=Information) 
calculated  over  four  cases  (1.  Ahmedabad;  2.  Venice;  3.  Richmond;  4.  Wallnut  Creek)  represented  by  dual  graphs 
(generalized streets are nodes, intersections are edges).  In the dual generalized approach centrality scores are calculated 
topologically on nodes, that represent generalized streets (single-identity routes formed by a plurality of sequential real 
streets).  The  passage  from  a  set  of  streets  to  a  set  of  generalized  streets  is  obtained  by  the  implementation  of  a 
generalization model. In the figure, we have used the previously defined Intersection Continuity Negotiation (ICN) model 
(Porta  et  al.  2004),  which  is  based  on  straightness  at  intersections;  in  conventional  space  syntax,  the  axial  mapping 
process embeds a generalization model based on uninterrupted linearity; variations have been recently proposed to axial 
mapping  based  on  a  concept  of  fractional  depth  (Dalton,  2001;  Dalton  et  al.  2003),  characteristic  points  of  navigation 
decision (Jiang and Claramunt, 2000) or named streets (Jiang and Claramunt, 2004b); in any case, generalized streets are 
defined  before  the  implementation  of  the  centrality  analysis,  thus  introducing  a  rationale  that  has  nothing  to  do  with 
centrality  in  itself,  while  deeply  affecting  the  results  of  the  whole  process.  Thus,  centrality  does  not  contributes  to  the 
identification of the urban routes that we see in red/blue maps above: it just qualifies them after they have been identified.

The primal representations acknowledge the existence of consistent behaviours of the same index across all cases, while 
different behaviours emerge for different indices: CC and CS are mainly  linear; CB is single scale and the dashed lines in 
the  linear-logarithmic  plot  show  an  exponential  distribution  P(C)~exp(-C/s)  for  self-organized  cities  (like  Ahmedabad, 
sAhm = 0.016), and  a Gaussian distribution P(C) ~exp(-1/2 x2/σ2) for mainly planned ones (like Richmond, σRich=0.049). 
Such  distinction  is  more  emphasized  in  CI  that  follows  a  power  law  distribution  P(C)~C-γ  in  self-organized  cities  
(γAhm=2.74), and an exponential distribution in planned cases (sRich=0.002). 
The  dual  representations:  CC  and  CS  are  mainly  linear.  CB  and  CI  exhibit  broad-scale  and  single-scale  distributions 
respectively for Ahmedabad and Richmond. Although it is possible to intuit the kind of law that would better represent 
each distribution, the deviation from the analytic curves is often very large. 

 
Differently than in primal, in dual graphs the statistical distribution of CD is a relevant feature because 
the number of intersections per street is conceptually unlimited (see section 3); addressed in a previous work 
(Porta et al. 2004), the CD distribution was found to follow a power-law rule in systems of a relevant size. The 
same analysis is hereby extended to the other centrality indices (fig. 4, bottom), revealing that, as in the pri-
mal representation, also in the dual CC and CS are mainly linear, CB and CI seem to follow broad-scale distri-
butions for Ahmedabad and single-scale distributions for Richmond. Nevertheless, the distributions are much 
less clear than in the primal analysis (notice for instance the deviation from the analytic fit in the CI of Ah-
medabad), confirming again that the primal representation has greater capabilities to extract such hidden or-
der from urban patterns.

5  Conclusions: the benefits of the primal approach and the Multiple Centrality As-

sessment  

A network analysis of four 1-square-mile samples of urban street systems is performed over primal and 
dual graphs. This introduces some considerations that strongly support the primal approach as a more com-
prehensive,  objective,  and  realistic  methodology  for  the  network  analysis  of  centrality  on  urban  street  sys-
tems. Being based on the world standard road-centreline-between-nodes format, the primal approach is suit-
able for making the best use of huge information resources developed and available in a broad variety of dif-
ferent fields. Moreover, the primal approach significantly reduces subjectivism in graph construction by ex-
cluding  problems  related  to  the  generalization  model.  While  in  the  dual  approach  centrality  statistical 
distributions, beside the case of CD in systems of relevant size, exhibit curves that significantly deviate from 
analytical fits, clear rules evidently and consistently emerge in the primal representation: this alone witnesses 
the higher power of the primal approach to capture some basic crucial structures of real urban streets systems. 
That seems to be inherently linked to the by far most relevant difference between the two options: while the 
primal representation allows to preserve a metric, geographic concept of distance, without abandoning the to-
pology  of  the  system,  the  dual  approach  necessarily  leads  to  just  a  topological  step-distance  concept  that 
makes indices and processes fundamentally more abstract, in that they miss much of the sensorial dimension 
of human ecology. Finally, our work shows that centrality is not just one single thing. Centrality is a multi-
faceted concept that, in order to measure the “importance” of single actors, organizations or places in com-
plex networks, has led to a number of different indices. We show that such indices, at least those mentioned 
in this article, do actually belong to four deeply different concepts of being central as being near, being be-
tween, being straight to and being critical for the others in a geographic system: the diversity of these “fami-
lies”  is  witnessed  by  the  consistently  different  distribution  of  centrality  scores  in  considered  cases,  both  in 
terms of spatial distributions as mapped in red/blue layouts and in terms of statistical distributions as mapped 
in cumulative plots. We also show that such indices, when applied to geographic networks, capture different 
ways for a place to be central, each way quite significant for a deeper understanding of how cities work. A 
good overview of such heterogeneity of being central in a street network is offered in fig. 3a, where between-
ness, straightness and information centrality “describe” the same city differently while exhibiting a good con-
sistency across cases. 

A new approach to the network analysis of centralities in geographic systems, such as urban street sys-
tems, is therefore appearing. Its three pillars are: 1. the use of primal graphs; 2. the use of metric distance; 3. 
the use of many different indices of centrality. As such, we may well name it Multiple Centrality Assessment 
(MCA).  Advantages  of  MCA,  if  compared  to  dual  approaches  like  space  syntax,  are  multifold:  1.  it  is  not 
based on any generalization model, therefore is more legible, feasible and objective; i.e. it leads to the identi-
fication of central routes by the sole “natural” convergence of centrality over chains of segmented streets; 2. it 
is fit to access the huge amount of information resources developed under the road-centreline-between-nodes 
world standard, including network constructed for traffic engineering and modelling or geo-mapping world-
wide; 3. it is more comprehensive and realistic, in that it couples the topology with the metrics of the system; 
4. it gives a set of multifaceted pictures of reality, rather than just one: that leads to more argumentative, thus 
less assertive, indications for action. Moreover, from a pure research perspective, MCA makes it possible to 
analyse  geographic  networks  under  the  same  roof  of  well  established  studies  of  non-geographic  networks 
such as biologic, technological or social networks.  

On this basis, further research may well proceed in three directions: on one hand, procedures for the 
systematic evaluation of proposed indices should be coordinated and standardized under a single tool; on the 
other hand, significant achievements are likely to be gained after establishing correlations between centralities 
of  the  networks  (which  are  structural  measures)  and  dynamics  on  the  networks  (like  patterns  of  land-uses, 
real-estate values, social groups allocation, crime rates, retail allocation, pedestrian and vehicular flows and 
others),  i.e.  by  the  re-coding  of  centrality  indices  in  the  new  context  of  “weighted”  networks  (Barrat  et  al. 
2004). It should not be of surprise in fact, as a general hypothesis, if some dynamics turn out to be strictly 
correlated  to  one  family  of  centrality  indices  while  others  are  more  correlated  to  a  different  family,  which 
would tell a lot about the deep meanings of being central for a place in real geographic systems and would 
open to a more targeted use of the tool in urban planning and design. Finally, a specific effort should be pro-
duced to normalize all centrality measures in order to make the comparison between systems of different size 
possible.

ABSTRACT 

In the wave-particle duality, a free particle can be considered as a wave packet. Is 
there a wave property that corresponds to the rest mass of the particle? This is an 
interesting question that has not been extensively explored before. We suggest that 
this problem may be approached by treating the rest mass on the same footing as 
energy  and  momentum.  Here  we  demonstrate  that,  by  assuming  that  the  matter 
wave of a particle behaves like a photon, one could derive the mass-energy relation 
from the solution of a simplified wave equation. This solution suggests that the rest 
mass  of  a  particle  is  associated  with  a  “transverse  wave  number”,  which 
characterizes the radial variation of the wave function in the transverse plane. This 
finding  has  several  appealing  features.  For  example,  it  shows  a  consistent 
geometrical  relationship  between  mass,  energy  and  momentum  in  both  the  wave 
and particle perspectives. Also, it predicts that a massless particle must travel at the 
constant  speed  of  light.  Furthermore,  from  a  philosophical  point  of  view,  this 
model  suggests  that  the  mass-energy  relation  attributed  to  the  special  theory  of 
relativity may have a root in the wave-particle duality. Indeed, it is shown that the 
Klein-Gordon equation can be derived naturally based on this model.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 

We know that matter has a dual character, with both wave and corpuscular properties [1]. 
In the Newtonian mechanics, a particle is regarded as a corpuscular object, the motion of which is 
determined  by  its  mass  and  the  external  force.  Clearly,  the  mass  is  considered  here  as  a  basic 
property of the particle in this corpuscular view. Later, it was suggested from the special theory of 
relativity (STR) that mass is not a constant but varies with the particle speed [2]. Then, only the 
rest mass can be regarded as a basic property of the particle. 
 
During the development of quantum mechanics, we further learned that a particle can also 
be considered as a wave [1]. This concept of wave-particle duality raises an interesting question: 
Is there a wave property that is connected to the rest mass of the particle? 

We  think  that  there  ought  to  be  such  a  connection.  As  suggested  from  the  relativistic 
theory, mass is closely related to energy and momentum [2]. It is well known that the momentum 
(a corpuscular property) of a particle is connected to its wave vector (a wave property) by the de 
Broglie relation [3], and the energy of a particle is connected to its wave frequency by the Planck's 

relation. If mass is to be treated on the same footing as momentum and energy, should not the rest 
mass also be connected to the magnitude of some sort of “intrinsic wave vector”?  

This work presents a simple idea that suggests a possible way to find such a connection. 
We will use a very simple model (i.e., a system containing a single free particle) to demonstrate 
our conceptual approach. 
 
II. DETAILS OF THE PROPOSED MODEL 
 
1.  Proposing a simplified wave equation that describes the asymptotic wave properties of a 

free particle in the vacuum 

 Following  the  spirit  of  many  pioneers  in  modern  physics,  including  Einstein  and 
deBroglie, we proposed that the matter wave of a particle with non-zero rest mass behaves very 
much like a photon. More specifically, we assume that: 

(1)    Like  the  photon,  a  particle  is  not  a  point-like  object,  instead,  it  behaves  like  a  wave 

 

packet. 

(2)  Like the photon, the matter wave of a particle is an excitation of a real physical field. 
 

These assumptions imply that the solution of the wave equation does not only give the probability 
of finding the presence of a particle, it actually represents an oscillation of the force field. These 
assumptions thus propose a slight modification from the traditional Copenhagen interpretation of 
the wave function [4]. This proposal, however, is not unreasonable, since the current interpretation 
on the physical meaning of the wave function was dependent more on philosophy rather than on 
physical evidence. While the statistical interpretation of the Copenhagen school had been strongly 
supported by major contributors of the quantum theory, including Bohr and Heisenberg, it was not 
universally  agreed.  In  fact,  many  well-known  physicists  at  that  time,  including  Einstein, 
Schrödinger,  and  de  Broglie,  had  opposed  such  an  interpretation  [4].  Here,  we  will  simply 
hypothesize that, like the photon, the matter wave of a particle with non-zero rest mass is a real 
physical wave.  
 
Our  hypothesis  may  be  justified  by  a  number  of  observations.  For  example,  it  is  well 
known that electrons can form interference pattern upon diffraction from a crystal. And, the wave 
nature  of  the  electron  is  clearly  demonstrated  in  the  operation  of  an  electron  microscope.  These 
examples  strongly  suggest  that  the  electron  can  behave  like  a  physical  wave.  Then,  what  is  the 
nature of the physical field (which is sometimes referred to as the “vacuum”) that gives rise to this 
matter wave?  

At  present,  there  are  only  four  known  physical  fields,  i.e.,  electro-magnetic  (EM),  weak 
interaction,  strong  interaction  and  gravitational.  According  to  the  standard  model  of  elementary 
particle today, the first three fields may not be regarded as truly independent and can be unified in 
extremely short distance (or high energy) [5]. Among these four different fields, only the EM field 
appears  to  have  sufficient  long  range  and  strength  to  support  the  wave  of  a  free  particle.  The 
gravitational field is extremely weak, while both the strong and weak forces are applicable only in 
very short range (10-13 cm and 10-16 cm, respectively). Since the wave packet representing a free 
particle (such as an electron) must be larger than the inter-atomic distance in a crystal (10-8 cm), if 
the matter wave is a real physical wave, it is most likely to be associated with an oscillation of the 
EM field. 

This  argument  may  be  unorthodox,  but  it  is  not  unreasonable.  First,  at  least  one  type  of 
particle  (photon)  is  already  known  to  be  the  excitation  of  the  EM  field.  Second,  since  electrons 

 

2

and positrons can be converted to photons (by annihilation) and vice versa (by pair creation), their 
mutual  convertibility  may  suggest  that  electrons  and  positrons  are  also  excitations  of  a  vacuum, 
the nature of which is related to the EM field. A similar argument can also be made on muons and 
their  anti-particles  since  they  can  decay  to  become  other  leptons  and  photons.  Hence,  it  is  not 
unreasonable to propose that different solutions of the wave equation of a vacuum (which behaves 
like the EM field in the long range) could represent particles of different rest masses. 

At  this  time,  we  do  not  have  sufficient  knowledge  about  the  detailed  properties  of  the 
vacuum to allow us to write down an exact wave equation for it. In this work, we can only aim at 
finding a reasonable approximation that may describe the basic wave properties of a free particle.  
Thus, we will take advantage of the knowledge that, in the range longer than 10-13 cm, the vacuum 
behaves  mainly  like  an  EM  field.  To  find  the  wave  equation  of  a  vacuum,  we  may  start  by 
considering the EM field first. From the Maxwell’s equations, one can derive [6]

Aµ = (φ, A) and jµ = (ρ, j ) and adopting the natural unit in which c = 1, Eq. (1) can be simplified to 
become 
 
 
 
Now,  if  one  wants  to  include  the  contribution  from  the  strong  and  weak  forces  to  the  vacuum, 
additional terms may be added, and the wave equation may look like 
 
 
 
At this time, it is not possible to determine the exact form of the contribution from the strong (FSt) 
and  weak  force  (FWk ).  We  only  know  that  they  are  very  short  ranged.  But,  if  we  consider  the 
simplest  case  in  which  the  system  contains  only  a  single  free  particle  (travelling  in  velocity  v), 
these  two  terms  become  less  important  because  there  is  no  particle-particle  interaction. 
Furthermore, since these forces vanish at very short distance (≤10-13 cm), they can be ignored if 
we are interested in solving the wave equation only in the asymptotic region (at distance > 10-13 
cm).

In  this  one-particle  system,  ρ  and  j  will  represent  the  self-charge  and  the  self-current 
associated with the particle. For a particle with no electrical charge, such as a photon, ρ and j of 
course are equal to zero. For a charged particle, such as an electron, ρ and j are very complicated. 
Although there is still a lack of satisfactory theory in calculating the distribution of the self-charge 
in an electron, it is known that the charge of the particle is highly localized in a small core [7]. 
Several earlier theoretical works had estimated that the charge of an electron is confined within a 
region  having  a  very  short  radius  (ro),  which  is  in  the  order  of  10-13  cm  [7].  The  wave  of  an 
electron, on the other hand, is supposed to occupy a much larger area (> 10-8 cm); otherwise, it

would  not  be  possible  to  generate  a  diffraction  pattern  from  a  crystal.  Then,  we  can  simplify 
Eqs.(3) by considering only the asymptotic region (i.e., r > ro ), where ρ and j can be assumed to 
be practically zero. Under this condition, we have 
 
 
 
The simplest solution of Eq. (4) is to let all components of this 4-vector to vary with space and 
time in the same manner. That is, if one can find a scalar function ψ, which satisfies

where 
ω are  the  wave  vector  and  frequency,  respectively.  This  solution  represents  the 
well-known  wave  function  of  a  photon.  This  plane  wave  solution,  however,  does  not  properly 
describe the properties of a particle with nonzero rest mass, which behaves like a mass point in the 
classical  limit.  Since  such  a  particle  must  have  a  limited  “size”,  the  probability  of  detecting  the 
2ψ ) in the transverse plane should not be uniform. That is, the probability of finding 
particle (i.e. 
the  particle  is  expected  to  be  highest  at  its  trajectory.  This  expectation  suggests  that  the  wave 
function of a free particle should depend not only on the coordinate parallel to its trajectory (i.e., 
xk ⋅ˆ
).  (Note:  Strictly  speaking,  the 
ˆ
projection of x on the transverse plane is  k

angle between them are fixed, we can use one to determine the coordinates of the other). 
Furthermore, since the trajectory of a free particle is a straight line, only one direction (i.e. 
 
the  direction  of  motion,  k )  is  specified.  The  wave  function  must  have  a  cylindrical  symmetry. 
Thus, one can assume that the general wave function representing a free particle has the form

3. Interpreting the physical meaning of the wave parameters 

The wave function of (16) contains four parameters, ω, k, 

 and n. What are their physical 
meanings? From the correspondence principle [9], the energy (E) and momentum (p) of a particle 
and 
in  the  classical  limit  can  be  obtained  from  the  expectation  values  of  the  E

which, of course, is just the Planck's relation. Similarly, by substituting Eq. (16) into Eq. (17B), 
one can obtain the de Broglie relation  
 
 
 
But what is the physical meaning of  l  in the classical limit? From Eq. (15), we know  l  is closely 
related to ω and k.  By combining Eqs. (15), (18), and (19), we can obtain

It  is  well  known  in  wave  mechanics  that  the  particle  velocity  (v)  is  determined  by  the  group 
velocity of the wave packet [10], that is,

Combining Eqs. (20) and (21), one can solve for E or p and obtain  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
In the classical limit, the momentum (p) is equal to the mass (M) times the velocity (v). Hence, we

Finally, what is the physical meaning of the parameter n? It appears that n is likely to be 
associated  with  the  helicity  of  the  free  particle.  First,  n  is  a  quantum  number  conjugate  to  the 
angular  coordinate θ.  Dimensional  analysis  thus  suggests  that  n  is  associated  with  some  sort  of 
angular momentum. The helicity operator can be regarded as equivalent to an angular momentum 
) [11]. In our solution of the wave 
operator about an axis of the particle's trajectory (in direction 
equation, the eigenvalue of this operator is 
. Secondly, from Eq. (16), one can see that, because 
θ, the wave function representing a free particle actually propagates in 
of the added phase factor n
a helical fashion. In fact, the wave function with +i θ represents a right-handed helix while the 
wave function with -i n θ represents a left-handed helix. 
 
III. DISCUSSION  
 
The validity of this model, of course, will depend on future experimental tests. We believe 
 
that  it  deserves  to  be  examined  carefully  because  it  appears  to  have  a  number  of  appealing 
features: 
 
1. It provides a simple explanation for the “Uncertainty principle” of Heisenberg. 

n

When  one  regards  the  particle  as  a  point-like  object,  as  in  the  traditional  concept  of 
quantum physics, it is very difficult to explain the “Uncertainty principle” of Heisenberg. We were 
usually  told  that  this  principle  is  an  observation  of  nature,  and  we  have  not  found  any  a  priori 

 

8

explanation behind it [12]. If the particle is indeed a wavepacket representing the excitation of a 
real  physical  field,  as  suggested  in  this  model,  we  can  explain  the  “Uncertainty  principle”  in  a 
straight  forward  way  based  on  the  wave  nature  of  the  “particle”.  As  shown  in  Eq.  (16),  the 
longitudinal component of the wave function has a phase angle (k·x – ωt). Because the particle is a 
wavepacket, it must have certain widths in the spatial and temporal dimensions, ∆x and ∆t, which 
can be linked to the linewidths of the wave number and frequency by the following relations,  

 
 

 
 

 
 
and 
 
Substituting Eqs. (18) and (19) into the above relations, we have 
 

∆k·∆x ~ 2π , 
∆ω·∆t ~ 2π . 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

(31A) 
(31B) 

 
 

 
 

∆p·∆x ~ h , 
∆E·∆t ~ h , 

 
and 
 
Thus,  one  cannot  simultaneously  determine  the  values  of  position  and  momentum  (or  time  and 
energy) of a free particle more precisely than what is described in Eqs. (32A) and (32B), which are

2.  It  suggests  a  possible  connection  between  the  special  theory  of  relativity  and  wave 

 

mechanics. 

One  important  result  of  this  work  is  our  demonstration  that  some  of  the  well  known 
relativistic relations can be derived using an approach of wave mechanics. STR is known to be a 
classical theory, which does not consider quantum effects. And thus, STR and quantum mechanics 
(or wave mechanics) are traditionally regarded as two totally independent physical theories. In this 
work,  we  show  that,  if  we  regard a  particle  as  an  excitation  of  the  vacuum  field,  the  relativistic 
relations  between  energy,  momentum  and  mass  can  be  derived  naturally  from  the  dispersion 
relation  of  the  wave  function  representing  a  free  particle.  This  result  thus  suggests  that  wave 
mechanics and STR could have a deeper philosophical connection in their theoretical roots.  
 
3. It naturally leads to the Klein-Gordon equation. 

After  demonstrating  that  l is  connected  with  m,  it  becomes  possible  to  relate  our  wave 
function  with  those  derived  in  the  traditional  wave  mechanics.  For  example,  using  Eq.  (25),  we 
can see that Eq. (11) now becomes

which is identical to the “Klein-Gordon equation” [9]. This implies that the wave function derived 
from the Klein-Gordon equation is equivalent to the longitudinal component of the travelling wave 
representing a free particle in our model. This is consistent with our starting assumption that the 
wave  function  of  a  particle  does  not  only  represent  the  probability  of  finding  the  particle,  it 
actually  represents  an  oscillation  of  the  force  field.  Furthermore,  the  fact  that  our  model  can 
naturally lead to the Klein-Gordon equation may indicate that our proposal of using Eq.(5) as the 
wave equation to describe the transporting properties of a free particle was a reasonable one.

4. It predicts the right effects of rest mass on the particle’s properties. 
What is the consequence of connecting the rest mass with 

 in the wave function of a free 
particle? Let us first examine what happens to a particle with zero rest mass, such as the case of a 
 is a constant, and the wave function 
photon. From Eq. (25), m = 0 implies  l  = 0. Hence, 
kˆψ  given  in  (16)  now  becomes  a  plane  wave.  Thus,  our  model  predicts  that  the  EM  wave  of  a 
photon in the vacuum is essentially a plane wave, which agrees well with the known results of the 
electromagnetic theory. Furthermore, when  l  = 0, Eq. (15) becomes 

(

which implies that the group velocity of a massless particle must equal to c, i.e.,   

 

 

ω = ck, 

 

v

This  provides  a  simple  explanation  to  the  fact  that  a  photon  must  always  travel  in  the  speed  of 
light.  

What happens when the rest mass is not zero? As shown in Fig.1, the wave function given 
in Eq. (16) not only oscillates in the longitudinal direction, it also oscillates in the radial direction 
in the transverse plane. The “wavelength” of this radial oscillation is equal to 2π/ l . This point 
can be seen easily, since the asymptotic form of the Bessel function for a large argument is

Thus,  l can be regarded as the "transverse wave number" of the free particle. From Eq. (25), we 
can see that the wavelength of this transverse oscillation is

which is identical to the “Compton wavelength” (

oscillates rapidly with r, it may diminish at a much shorter distance. If a particle is represented by 
a  wave  packet,  l and 
can  vary  over  a  narrow  range.  Let  us  denote  r  as  the  cut-off  radius 
beyond which the wave function vanishes. From Eq. (35),

Thus,  a  particle  with  a  larger  m  will  have  a  smaller  effective  radius  in  the  corresponding  wave 
function. In other words, the matter wave representing a particle with heavier mass would be more 
“particle-like”,  (i.e.,  the  probability  of  finding  the  particle  is  more  localized).  This  may  explain 
why an electron behaves more like a “particle” than a photon. 
 
5. It implies a consistent geometrical relationship between mass, energy and momentum. 

In  the  study  of  theoretical  physics,  it  is  not  uncommon  to  consider  some  of  the  physical 
relationships in term of geometry. We would like to explore if the result of our model makes good 
sense  based  on  a  geometrical  consideration.  Using  the  natural  unit  in  which  c  =  1,  the  well 
established mass-energy relation (i.e., Eq. (26)) can be written as

which appears as a geometrical relationship that E is the vector sum of two perpendicular vectors 
with amplitudes equal to p and m. (See Fig. 2a). Since m (or E) is a scalar instead of a vector, Eq. 
(39) cannot be regarded as a real vectorial relationship. Instead, it may suggest that m is associated 
with  some  sort  of  “intrinsic  momentum”  that  characterizes  the  spatial  variation  of  the  wave 
function in directions orthogonal to p.

Similarly, using the natural unit, Eq. (15) derived from our model can be rewritten as 

 

 

(ћω)2 = (ћk)2 + (ћ )l

2, 

 

 

 

 

(40) 

 
which,  like  Eq.  (39),  also  suggests  a  geometrical  relationship  that  ћω  is  a  “vector  sum”  of  two 
perpendicular vectors with amplitudes equal to ћk and ћ . (See Fig. 2b).  In this case, however, 
we do know that  l is a “wave number” that characterizes the oscillation of the wave function in a 

l

l

plane transverse to k. By comparing Fig.2a with Fig.2b, and recalling the Planck’s relation and the 
de Broglie relation, one can easily see that it is highly natural to associate m with  l . Furthermore, 
by comparing the relationship between p and m with the relationship between k and  l , it makes 
good philosophical sense for the rest mass to be connected with a “transverse wave number”. 
Hence, the result of this model suggests a rather pleasing picture, in which the corpuscular 
 
properties m, p and E in classical mechanics are all connected with some sort of wave numbers in 
wave  mechanics.  More  specifically,  p  is  connected  with  the  spatial  wave  number  along  the 
direction of the particle trajectory, E is connected with a wave number in the dimension of time, 
and m is connected with a spatial wave number in the transverse plane. 
 
6. It predicts that the rest mass is Lorentz invariant. 

Finally, since the rest mass is known to be a relativistic scalar, in order to associate m with 
,  one  must  show  that  the  l  defined  in  our  model  also  behaves  like  a  scalar  under  a  Lorentz 
l
transformation. Indeed, as shown in Appendix A, we found that the value of  l  is independent of 
the inertial frame. In other words,  does satisfy the requirement of being a relativistic scalar. 

Since the wave equation we used to describe the asymptotic behavior of a particle wave is 
in  a  form  similar  to  that  of  the  EM  radiation  in  a  vacuum,  the  solution  of  our  wave  equation  is 
analogous  to  that  encountered  in  the  studies  of  cylindrical  waveguides  in  the  classical 
electromagnetic theory [14]. It has been noted that, due to the form of the dispersion relation, the 
cut-off wavenumber (which is equivalent to our transverse wavenumber) in a waveguide could be 
viewed as an “effective mass” of the electromagnetic radiation. However, we must point out that 
the physical concept of this work is fundamentally different from that of the waveguide problem. 
Our  wave  equation  (i.e.,  Eq.  (5))  describes  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  the  matter  wave 
representing a free particle in the vacuum, not the radiation wave within a metal compartment. We 
are concerned with the variation of the particle wave packet at sub-atomic dimension (10-7 cm or 
less), while the radiation problem deals with variation of electromagnetic fields in dimension of 
centimeters.  Furthermore,  in  the  case  of  radiation,  the  cut-off  wavenumber  is  determined  by  the 
imposed external boundary conditions (i.e., dimensions of the waveguide), which is not Lorentz 
invariant. Thus, the “effective mass” in the EM radiation within a cylindrical waveguide cannot be 
regarded  as  a  true  mass.  In  our  case,  we  have  shown  in  Appendix  A  that  the  value  of  l  in  our 
model is a relativistic scalar. 

  
Thus, this model appears to be able to explain a number of important physical concepts in 
a simple and straight forward manner. Now, what are its shortcomings? One major limitation of 
this model is that it cannot explain the discreteness of the rest mass. We think that this limitation 
arises because our proposed simplified wave equation is only valid in the asymptotic region ( r > 
ro). In this model, we are not concerned with finding the internal structure of a particle. Instead, 
our major interest is to understand the wave properties of a particle in view of the wave-particle 
duality. Due to a lack of knowledge on the distribution of the self-charge and self-current, we did 
not  know  the  exact  form  of  the  wave  equation  of  a  free  particle  at  short  distance  (  i.e.,  in  the 
“core” region, r < 10-13 cm). If one can write down the exact form of the wave equation in the core 
region  and  solve  it,  one  may  be  able  to  obtain  the  restricted  values  of  l  from  the  boundary 
condition,  that  requires  the  wave  function  in  the  asymptotic  region  to  match  with  the  wave 
function in the core region at r ~ ro. Building such a theory is a very complicated task [7]; it is 
beyond the scope of this work. 

Furthermore, at the very short distance, one needs to consider not only the EM field, but 

 

12

also  the  weak  and  strong  interactions.  Thus,  the  wave  equation  governing  the  behavior  of  the 
particle wave at very short distances is far more complicated than the field equation derived from 
the Maxwell equations. So far, we are not aware of any wave equation that can explicitly include 
all known forces [15]. (Note: The standard model of elementary particle today treats the particle as 
a  point-like  object  and  thus  is  not  suitable  to  describe  the  internal  structure  of  a  particle  wave). 
Hence, we have to wait for future development before we can solve the wave equation of a particle 
at the core region and determine the limitation on the value of  l .

Active Amplification of the Terrestrial Albedo  
to Mitigate Climate Change: An Exploratory Study∗ 

Robert M. Hamwey†

Abstract: To date, international efforts to  mitigate climate  change have focussed on reducing 
emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  energy,  transportation  and  agriculture  sectors,  and  on 
sequestering  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  in  forests.  Here,  the  potential  to  complement  these 
efforts  by  actions  to  enhance  the  reflectance  of  solar  insolation  by  the  human  settlement  and 
grassland  components  of  the  Earth’s  terrestrial  surface  is  explored.  Preliminary  estimates 
derived using a static two dimensional radiative transfer model indicate that such efforts could 
amplify the overall planetary albedo enough to offset the current global annual average level of 
radiative forcing caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases by as much as 30% or 0.76 Wm-2. 
Terrestrial  albedo  amplification  may  thus  extend,  by  about  25  years,  the  time  available  to 
advance  the  development  and  use  of  low-emission  energy  conversion  technologies  which 
ultimately  remain  essential  to  mitigate  long-term  climate  change.  While  a  scoping  analysis 
indicates  the  technical  feasibility  of  sufficiently  enhancing  human  settlement  and  grassland 
albedos  to  levels  needed  to  achieve  reductions  in  radiative  forcing  projected  here,  additional 
study  is  required  on  two  fronts.  Firstly,  the  modelled  radiative  forcing  reductions  are  static 
estimates. As they would generate climate feedbacks, more detailed dynamic climate modelling 
would be needed to confirm the stationary value of the radiative forcing reduction that would 
result  from  land  surface  albedo  amplification.  Secondly,  land  surface  albedo  amplification 
schemes  may  have  important  economic  and  environmental  impacts.  Accurate  ex  ante  impact 
assessments would be required to validate global implementation of related measures as a viable 
mitigation strategy.

1. Introduction 

the 

The  negative  environmental  and  economic  impacts  of  anthropogenic  climate 
change,  and 
inherent  difficulties  of  reducing  causative  greenhouse  gas 
accumulations  in  the  atmosphere,  are  now  widely  acknowledged.  Greenhouse  gas 
emissions – an unavoidable by-product of oil, gas and coal energy conversion – occur 
principally in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2). Since the onset of industrialisation in 
1750,  energy-related  CO2  emissions  have  accumulated  in  the  atmosphere,  raising  the 
CO2  concentration  level  from  278  ppmv  in  1750  to  378  ppmv  at  the  end  of  2004 
(Keeling  and  Whorf  2005).  Rising  atmospheric  concentrations  of  CO2  and  other 
greenhouse  gases  increase  the  radiative  forcing  of  the  climate  system  (Hansen  et  al. 
1997; Ramaswamy et al. 2001) that leads to climate change. 

The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC)  has  estimated  that  the 
total  radiative  forcing  of  the  climate  system  due  to  anthropogenic  emissions  of  long-

lived and globally mixed greenhouse gases was 2.43 Wm-2 ± 10% in 1998 (Houghton et 
al.  2001).  CO2  emissions  resulting  from  fossil  fuel  combustion  were  estimated  to 
account for 60%, or 1.46 Wm-2, of this anthropogenic forcing, making it the dominant 
human-influenced  greenhouse  gas.  More  recent  studies  have  indicated  that  total 
anthropogenic radiative forcing has risen to a current value of over 2.50 Wm-2 while the 
relative contribution of CO2 to this total has increased to 62% (Hofmann et al. 2005). 

In  view  of  their  dominant  role  in  precipitating  adverse  climate  changes, 
international  mitigation  efforts  have  largely  focussed  on  reducing  emissions  of  CO2 
through energy efficiency and conservation measures, and on sequestering atmospheric 
CO2  through  afforestation  programmes  (UNFCCC  2003).  These  activities  continue  to 
be  motivated  by  national  policies  pursuant  to  the  United  Nations  Framework 
Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC),  and  more  recently,  by  the  Convention’s 
Kyoto Protocol. However, analyses suggest that achievement of current Kyoto Protocol 
reduction  targets  is  at  best  consistent  with  a  trajectory  to  future  stabilisation  of  CO2 
concentrations at 550 ppmv, a level substantially higher than current values and one that 
falls  short  of  avoiding  significant  adverse  climate  change  during  the  current  century 
(Nakicenovic and Swart 2000). This points to the need for stronger mitigation efforts, 
not only through higher emissions reduction targets and wider international participation 
in emissions reduction activities, but also through novel approaches to climate change 
mitigation. Within this context, the IPCC has recognised that, in addition to greenhouse 
gas  emissions  reductions,  geoengineering  offers  a  potential  approach  for  mitigating 
changes in the global climate (Apps et al. 2001).  

Geoengineering  involves  large  scale  and  purposeful  efforts  to  circumvent  the 
anthropogenic greenhouse effect by actively managing the energy balance of the Earth 
(NAS 1992; Flannery 1997; Keith 2000). A common element of many geoengineering 
schemes  involves  reducing  the  incident  radiative  flux  of  solar  energy  in  the  lower 
atmosphere and at the Earth’s surface to offset the warming effect of greenhouse gases. 
In  a  recent  study,  it  was  shown  that  the  geoengineering  schemes  that  reduce  incident 
solar  radiation  uniformly  by  1.8%  could  largely  mitigate  global  and  annual  mean 
climate change resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations from pre-
industrial levels (Govindasamy and Caldeira 2000).  

To  date,  geoengineering  proposals  have  typically  been  of  high  technological 
content  and  cost,  implemented  at  the  macro-level  by  governments,  and  centred  on 
schemes to enhance terrestrial carbon sinks or partially shield the Earth’s surface from 
sunlight  (Flannery  et  al.  1997;  Keith  2001).  The  latter  have  included  schemes  to 
increase the planetary albedo of the Earth by injecting aerosols into the atmosphere and 
deploying an array of metallic balloons in the stratosphere or reflective mirrors in Earth 
orbit.  

Terrestrial albedo amplification through land surface modification described here 
is  distinctly  different  from  previous  ‘geoengineering’  proposals  in  two  ways. 
Mechanistically,  it  aims  to  increase  the  amount  of  solar  radiation  reflected  by  the 
Earth’s surface rather than reducing incident solar radiation flux. Secondly, in practical 
terms, land surface modification schemes have relatively low technological content and 
are  based  on  the  collective  voluntary  efforts  of  local  actors  rather  than  a  centralised 
effort  of  government  institutions.  These  features  imply  that  land-based  surface  albedo 
amplification  costs  could  be  relatively  low  and  distributed  among  the  participating 
global  population,  making  the  approach  attractive  from  both  an  economic  and 
implementation perspective.

2. Land-based Surface Albedo Amplification as a Mitigation Option 

Over  the  past  decade.  a  number  of  studies  have  demonstrated  that  land  use 
changes resulting from natural and human activities can significantly modify radiative 
climate forcings on regional scales by changing surface albedos and the energy budget 
of  the  lower  atmosphere  that  they  regulate  (Charney  et  al.  1977;  Bonan  et  al.  1992; 
Henderson-Sellers  et  al.  1993;  Xue  and  Shukla  1993;  Myhre  and  Myhre  2003).  Such 
studies  have  examined  the  effects  on  climate  of  regionally  specific  land-use  changes. 
For  example,  it  has  been  shown  that  during  the  past  two  centuries,  regional-scale 
replacement of natural forests by agricultural crops in the continental United States has 
increased  surface  albedos  and  reduced  radiative  forcing  (Bonan  1997).  The  climatic 
effects  of  projected  future  land  use  changes  have  also  been  examined.  One  study  has 
shown  that  increased  radiative  forcing  arising  from  decreases  in  surface  albedos 
associated  with  large-scale  boreal  and  temperate  forestation  programs,  may  offset  the 
climate change mitigation effects of carbon sequestration underpinning such programs 
(Betts 2000). 

in 

regional  hydrological  cycles 

In addition to albedo related radiative effects, many of these studies have shown 
that  regional  changes  in  surface  albedo  also  trigger  important  climatic  feedbacks, 
including  changes 
from  modified 
evapotranspiration  patterns  of  soil  and  vegetation.  Detailed  climate  models  coupling 
general  atmospheric  circulation  and  land  surface  models  have  been  advanced  to 
examine the climatic effects of different land use patterns (Bonan 1995). These models 
capture  not  only  the  changes  in  the  surface  energy  budget  arising  from  changes  in 
surface  albedo,  but  also  the  associated  climate  feedbacks  resulting  from  induced 
changes in latent, sensible and sub-surface heat flux (Bonan 1996). 

resulting 

A  major  finding  emerging  from  research  on  the  climatic  effects  of  land  use 
patterns is that the regional climate forcing caused by modern land use practices can be 
comparable  to  other  anthropogenic  climate  forcings  including  those  resulting  from 
increased greenhouse and aerosol emissions (Bonan 1997). This suggests that there may 
be  significant  potential  to  offset  greenhouse  gas  climate  forcing  through  –  as  yet 
unexplored – intentional efforts to increase the Earth’s land surface albedo on a global 
scale by modifying the radiative characteristics of human settlements and vegetation. 

3. Methods, Model Description and Results 

The  terrestrial  albedo  amplification  scheme  described  here  is  motivated  by  the 
observation that just as greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change have grown 
with  increasing  world  population,  so  too  have  the  surface  areas  of  settled  land  and 
human-managed grasslands and their contributions to the value of the overall planetary 
albedo.  Approximations  of  the  current  magnitude  of  these  contributions  are  combined 
with global demographic and vegetation data, and estimates of the extent to which land 
surface  albedos  may  be  increased,  to  construct  globally  amplified  terrestrial  albedo 
distributions  for  postulated  amplification  scenarios.  These  distributions  are  then 
convolved  with  solar  insolation  data  to  model  first  order  spatially  resolved  radiative 
forcing reductions achievable under each albedo amplification scenario. In addition, the 
potential  of  these  radiative  forcing  reductions  to  offset  the  positive  radiative  forcing 
associated  with  rising  concentrations  of  greenhouse  gases  in  the  atmosphere  is 
evaluated.  Two  amplification  scenarios  are considered.  Scenario  1  involves  enhancing 
the  albedo  of  human  settlements  (manmade  surfaces).  Scenario  2  involves  enhancing 
the albedo of the world’s grasslands.

R Hamwey: Active amplification of the terrestrial albedo to mitigate climate change 

A  first  order  estimate  of  the  magnitude  of  a  perturbation  in  the  radiative 
forcing, F∆ , of the Earth’s climate due to changes in the shortwave (0.2 – 4.0 µ) surface 
albedo  can  be  readily  determined  when  the  magnitude  of  the  all-sky  downward 
shortwave solar flux at the Earth’s surface, Φ ,  and  the  perturbed,  a(cid:4) ,  and  unperturbed, 
a , values of the all-sky shortwave surface albedo are specified for each point and time 
on the Earth’s surface (Hartmann 1994). In this first order approximation, which ignores 
feedback  perturbations  arising  from  changed  surface  albedos  (see  Section  4  for  a 
discussion),  the  decrease  in  global  radiative  forcing  at  an  element  s  of  the  Earth’s 
surface due to albedo amplification at any time t is given by:

, and monthly all-sky surface albedos, 

Monthly  average  all-sky  downward  shortwave  solar  flux  at  the  Earth’s 
, from the WCRP/GEWEX 
surface,
surface radiation budget (SRB) project release 2 (Stackhouse et al. 2001) were used as 
inputs in the model. Both of these SRB parameters are measured over the 0.2 – 4.0 µ 
solar spectrum. Monthly SRB data covering the entire January through December 1986 
were  used  in  the  model.  Surface  albedo  perturbations  were  applied  only  to  snow-free 
cells.  The  presence  of  snow  in  a  cell  during  any  given  month  was  determined  from 
monthly  snow  cover  data  for  1986  from  NASA  (Armstrong  et  al.  2003).  Since  only 
SRB all-sky radiation parameters were used in the model, and because the derivation of 
these  data  within  the  SRB  project  implicitly  accounts  for  the  effect  of  monthly  cloud 
transmittance, there was no need to monitor each cell’s monthly configuration of clear-
sky  and  overcast  conditions  for  independent  clear-sky  and  overcast  surface  radiation 
flux calculations in the model. 

The  SRB  data  were  used  to  compute  monthly  values  of  the  unperturbed  (i.e., 
baseline  state)  net  radiative  shortwave  flux  at  the  Earth’s  surface  due  to  surface 
absorption of incident shortwave solar radiation for each cell. To simulate active albedo 
amplification, positive perturbations in the surface albedo of land cells were introduced 
in  the  model  (as  described  below).  The  difference  in  net  radiative  flux  between  the 
baseline and perturbed surface albedo states was calculated monthly for each cell (using 
Eq. 1 above) to estimate monthly perturbations in radiative forcing for each cell, and by 
integrating  these,  for  each  1  degree  zonal  band  from  -90  to  90  degrees  latitude.  From 
these  data,  spatially  resolved  and  (surface  area  weighted)  zonal  global  annual  average 
decreases in radiative forcing were derived.

R Hamwey: Active amplification of the terrestrial albedo to mitigate climate change 

Surface albedo perturbations introduced in the model were set for each cell based 
on  values  of  human  population  and  grassland  fractions  characterising  each  cell  and 
specifications  set  in  the  albedo  amplification  scenarios  on  how  each  cell’s  surface 
albedo  changes  in  proportion  to  these  values.  Accurate  and  current  spatially  resolved 
population and land cover data thus formed essential inputs to the model. 

Global  data  on  population  in  1995  from  the  Gridded  Population  of  the  World 
(GPW) version 2 dataset provided population counts in each land cell over the Earth’s 
surface for a total world population of ~ 5.67 billion in 1995 (Balk et al. 2004, CIESEN 
2000).  To  simulate  the  current  2005  global  population  distribution,  the  1995  GPW 
population  data  where  uniformly  scaled  up  by  a  factor  of  1.14;  the  ratio  of  estimated 
1995 to 2005 global population (USCB 2005). Land cover data from the United States 
Geological  Survey’s  (USGS)  Global  Land  Cover  Characterization  (GLCC)  classifies 
the fraction of International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) vegetation zones 
in each cell based on 1 km resolution satellite observations covering the 12-month April 
1992  to  March  1993  period  (Loveland  et  al.  2000).  Both  the  1  degree  and  1  km 
resolution  data  were  analysed  to  confirm  consistency,  however,  only  the  1  degree 
resolution data was used in the model. The current 2005 distribution of world vegetation 
zones  was  assumed  not  to  have  changed  significantly  from  the  1992-93  distribution 
used to derive the GLCC dataset. 

3.1) Scenario 1: Amplification of human settlement albedos 

Under scenario 1, in order to compute the total surface area of human settlements 
capable of being ‘whitened’ in an albedo amplification effort, an estimate of the average 
per  capita  artificial  surface  area  that  makes  up  human  settlements  must  be  made.  The 
area of the terrestrial surface occupied by human infrastructure is not accurately known. 
Although the resolution of currently characterised global land surface imagery (~1km2) 
is capable of capturing urban areas, it does not capture dispersed human infrastructure 
outside of urban agglomerations. A world total of approximately 260,000 km2 of urban 
and built-up area under the IGBP classification scheme was derived from 1 km GLCC 
analyses  undertaken  here,  indicating  a  global  average  of  46  m2  of  urban  surface  per 
capita in 1995.  

The  magnitude  of  total  (urban  and  dispersed)  artificial  surface  area  per  capita 
significantly exceeds the value of urban surface area per capita. Artificial surface area is 
generally  considered  to  include  all  residential,  recreational,  industrial,  commercial, 
transportation-related and institutional land (occupied by man-made physical structures 
and adjoining landscaped areas) but excludes agricultural land (USDA 2003). Based on 
this  definition,  estimates  point  to  a  global  average  value  of  440  m2  to  500  m2  of 
artificial  surface  per  capita  (UNEP/RIVM  2004;  Wackernagel  et  al  2002).  Moreover, 
estimated  values  of  artificial  surface  per  capita  vary  considerably  among  regions.  The 
highest regional estimate of artificial surface per capita is for United States where it is 
estimated  to  exceed  1,500  m2  per  capita  (USDA  2003),  whereas  for  East  and  South 
Asia, regional estimates are the lowest at about 300 m2 per capita (UNEP/RIVM 2004). 
Based on these estimates, a global average per capita reflective surface area for human 
settlements, σ, of 500 m2 was adopted in this study.  

A  composite  surface  albedo  for  human  settlements,  ha =  0.15,  a  typical  urban 
value  (Jin  et  al.  2005;  Taha  2005),  was  assumed  globally  as  the  unperturbed  surface 
albedo  of  human  settlements.  To  simulate  the  perturbed  state,  the  surface  albedo  of 
human  settlements  was  enhanced  globally  by  100%  to  a  higher  value  of  ha(cid:4)
 =  0.3, 
resulting  from  an  intentional  ‘whitening’  of  human  structures  as  a  climate  change

mitigation  measure.  In  the  model, σ,    ha and  ha(cid:4)  were  assumed  to  be  invariant  with 
respect to solar zenith angle and season. 

Using  the  adopted  values  of σ,    ha and  ha(cid:4) ,  the  surface  albedo  values  of  cells 
were revised upward in proportion to the human population in each cell. For each cell s 
and month t the perturbed surface albedo was computed as:

radiative forcing in each cell s during month t immediately follows from Eq. 1.

Monthly changes in surface albedo and radiative forcing were calculated for each 
cell.  The  baseline  data  indicate  an  annual  average  global  all-sky  surface  albedo  of 
0.140804.  In response to the increase in the surface albedos of human settlements under 
scenario  1,  the  model  projects  this  figure  to  increase  by  0.000875,  and  the  annual 
globally averaged radiative forcing to decrease by 0.17 Wm-2.  

3.2) Scenario 2: Amplification of grassland albedos 

Under scenario 2, amplification of the planetary albedo is achieved by increasing 
the surface albedo of the world’s grasslands. The ‘grassland’ area assumed in the model, 
and  referred  to  hereafter  simply  as  grasslands,  includes  3  IGBP  classifications:  open 
shrubland, grasslands and savannah. Taken together, about 30% of the Earth’s land area 
falls under these three IGBP categories.  

It  is  not  possible  to  define  a  common  baseline  value  of  unperturbed  grassland 
surface  albedo  for  all  model  cells  due  to  latitudinal  and  seasonal  variations  in  this 
quantity that result from temporal variations in cloud cover, mean solar zenith angles, 
precipitation  and  phase  offsets  of  annual  vegetation  growth  cycles.  Therefore,  an 
algorithm  was  used  to  dynamically  specify  grassland  baseline  surface  albedos.  Within 
the model, the mean monthly values of surface albedo for cells in each 1 degree latitude 
zonal band with a grassland fraction of 80% or more were calculated. These values were 
used  to  define  the  baseline  surface  albedo  of  grasslands  as  a  function  of  latitude  and 
month. For a minority of latitude bands without cells containing a grassland fraction of 
80% or more, the baseline value was set to that of the nearest latitude band in which this 
condition was met. Through this procedure, a set of unperturbed baseline surface albedo 
values  of  cell  grasslands, 
,  was  established.  The  global  annual  average  all-sky

grassland surface albedo derived from the SRB dataset was 0.17.

R Hamwey: Active amplification of the terrestrial albedo to mitigate climate change 

Monthly changes in surface albedo and radiative forcing were calculated for each 
cell. In response to the increase in the surface albedos of grasslands under scenario 2, 
the  model  projects  an  increase  in  the  annual  average  global  all-sky  surface  albedo  of 
0.002626  and  a  decrease  in  annual  globally  averaged  radiative  forcing  of  0.59  Wm-2. 
Such a large decrease is not unexpected considering that 30% of the Earth’s land surface 
is  occupied  by  grasslands,  particularly  at  low  and  middle  latitudes  where  the  value  of 
annual  insolation  is  highest.  However,  because  human  intervention  to  enhance  the 
surface  albedo  of  grasslands  may  be  feasible  for  only  the  portion  of  the  world’s 
grasslands  that  can  be  managed  by  man,  the  0.59  Wm-2 decrease  in  radiative  forcing 
achievable  under  scenario  2  represents  an  upper  limit  for  a  presumed  uniform  global 
grassland surface albedo increase of 25%. If albedo enhancement is feasible only for a 
fraction, β,  of  all  grasslands,  and  this  subset  has  the  same  spatial  distribution  as  the 
larger set of world grasslands, scenario 2 would result in a decrease in annual globally 
averaged radiative forcing of 0.59β Wm-2.  

3.3) Detailed results 

Monthly  spatial  and  latitudinal  estimates  of  decreases  in  radiative  forcing  were 
computed  by  the  model  for  scenarios  1  and  2.  Spatial  maps  of  the  annual  average 
decrease in radiative forcing resulting from scenario 1, scenario 2, and scenario 1 and 2 
combined, are presented in Figure 1. The annual average decreases in radiative forcing 
resulting  from  scenario  1  and  2,  as  a  function  of  latitude,  are  presented  in  Figure  2. 
These results are discussed further below. 

4. Qualification of Results: Climate Feedbacks 

The  radiative  transfer  model  used  in  this  study  only  provides  an  estimate  of

In  response  to  the  shortwave  radiative  forcing  perturbation  arising  from  increased 
surface albedos, Eq. 6 indicates that several parameters will adjust in order to maintain 
radiative equilibrium at the land surface. However, the radiative transfer model used in 
this study provides no information on how these adjustments are partitioned; a coupled 
climate land surface model is required to provide such an indication (Bonan 1997).

R Hamwey: Active amplification of the terrestrial albedo to mitigate climate change 

surface  albedos.  Such  reductions  have  been  examined  in  previous  studies  of  tropical 
regions  (Charney  et  al.  1977;  Henderson-Sellers  and  Gornitz  1984;  Xue  and  Shukla 
1993;  Dirmeyer  and  Shukla  1994).  At  the  same  time,  these  primary  feedbacks  will 
themselves  induce  secondary  feedbacks.  If  reductions  in  annual  average  cloud  cover 
relative  to  the  baseline  state  are  substantial,  they  may  raise  absorbed  shortwave  flux, 
and reduce absorbed longwave flux due to reduced cloud forcing. This could potentially 
result  in  a  net  increase  of  annual  (shortwave  +  longwave)  insolation  and  an  overall 
heating  effect  (Charney  et  al.  1977),  or  no  significant  decrease  in  temperature 
(Henderson-Sellers and Gornitz 1984), even though surface albedo has increased.   

Whereas the above feedbacks may be important in tropical regions, modelling of 
modern surface albedo changes of order ~ 0.02 – 0.06 occurring in the temperate United 
States  indicate  no  significant  change  in  seasonally  averaged  precipitation  and  a  net 
cooling effect (Bonan 1997). Moreover, a recent global simulation of regional climate 
responses to land conversion induced surface albedo increases (DeFries et al. 2002) has 
highlighted that effects are quite different in  the  tropics,  where  net  warming  and  drier 
hydrological conditions are expected, than in temperate regions where net cooling and 
largely unaltered hydrological conditions result. 

The  complex  nature  of  the  multiple  feedbacks  above  emphasises  the  need  for 
accurate coupled general atmospheric circulation and land surface modelling of global 
surface  albedo  amplification  schemes  to  examine  how  long-term  surface  radiation 
budgets,  energy  budgets,  and  climatologies  may  ultimately  be  affected  in  different 
regions.  

5. Potential Mitigation Benefits 

that, 
The  radiative  forcing  perturbation  estimates  obtained  here  suggest 
implemented  together,  the  two  albedo  amplification  scenarios  described  above  could 
potentially offset 0.76 Wm-2, or about 30% of the approximately 2.50 Wm-2 of radiative 
forcing  caused  by  anthropogenic  emissions  of  all  long-lived  and  globally  mixed 
greenhouse  gases.  However,  as  Figure  1  shows,  decreases  in  radiative  forcing  vary 
considerably by region. Expectedly, the spatial and latitudinal distributions of radiative 
forcing  perturbations  under  scenario  1  and  2  closely  trace  the  underlying  physical 
distribution of population and grasslands. But as these two distributions are dissimilar, 
the  combined  effects  of  scenarios  1  and  2  result  in  a  distribution  of  radiative  forcing 
perturbations  that  extends  over  a  fairly  large  fraction  of  the  terrestrial  surface. 
Nevertheless, perturbations significantly higher than the global average occur in highly 
populated and high grassland fraction cells.  

As Figure 2 shows, the latitudinal distributions of annual average radiative forcing 
reductions  achieved  under  scenarios  1  and  2  are  mostly  concentrated  in  the  Northern 
Hemisphere. Unlike greenhouse gas emissions which result in nearly uniform latitudinal 
increases in radiative forcing due to mixing in the atmosphere, the decreases in radiative 
forcing  induced  by  land  surface  albedo  amplification  vary  in  proportion  to  the 
underlying  latitudinal  distribution  of  population  and  grasslands.  Projections  of  the 
effects of latitude dependent albedo amplification on climate and climate change require 
study in a general circulation model. Yet a recent study of this type (Govindasamy and 
Caldeira  2000)  suggests  that  it  is  not  necessary  for  the  latitudinal  pattern  of  radiative 
forcing due to albedo amplification to match that of greenhouse gases to largely negate 
the effects of the latter.

R Hamwey: Active amplification of the terrestrial albedo to mitigate climate change 

 The mitigation power of albedo amplification can be compared with that of CO2 
emissions  reductions  by  evaluating  the  decrease  in  atmospheric  CO2  concentration 
needed to achieve a similar reduction in radiative forcing. A simplified expression for 
the  calculation  of  radiative  forcing  induced  by  CO2  has  been  validated  by  the  IPCC 
(Ramaswamy et al. 2001) as: 

α∆ =

    (7) 

where α=  5.35  and  C  and  C0  are  the  perturbed  and  unperturbed  CO2  concentrations. 
This  expression  indicates  that  the  estimated  decreases  in  radiative  forcing  of  0.17  and 
0.59 Wm-2 under scenarios 1 and 2 respectively, are equivalent to decreases obtained by 
reductions in atmospheric CO2 concentration of 12 and 40 ppmv, or 50 ppmv when the 
two scenarios are implemented together (note: Eq. 7 is not linear).  

Recent observations in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere indicating a 2 
ppmv annual growth rate of atmospheric CO2 concentrations (NIWA 2004; Keeling and 
Whorf  2005)  would,  ceteris  paribus,  suggest  that  the  albedo  amplification  measures 
modelled  here  could  offset  as  much  as  25  years  of  global  CO2  emissions  at  current 
levels (~ 6 yrs under scenario 1 and ~ 20 yrs under scenario 2). Although such an offset 
would not obviate the need for long term emission reductions to reduce future climate 
change, it could substantially extend the time available to advance the development and 
use of low-emission energy conversion technologies. Land surface albedo amplification 
efforts  may  thus  represent  potential  options  to  complement  mitigation  activities 
focussing on emissions reductions.  

6. Implications and Feasibility 

6.1) Scenario 1: Amplification of human settlement albedos 

While the estimates reported here indicate that amplification of human settlement 
and grassland albedos have the potential to significantly offset radiative forcing caused 
by  anthropogenic  greenhouse  gases,  the  scope  for,  and  feasibility  of  engineering  such 
amplifications  on  a  global  scale  for  climate  change  mitigation  remains  largely 
unexplored.  Technologies  are  readily  available  to  amplify  the  surface  reflectance  of 
human  settlements, and  these  have  been  the  subject  of  considerable  research  over  the 
past decade (Rosenfeld et al. 1997) within the context of reducing ambient temperatures 
and  associated  energy  costs  for  cooling,  and  ground-level  ozone  concentrations,  in 
urban heat islands (UHI). However, the potential of substantially enhancing the albedo 
of vegetation, particularly grass species, remains unexplored. 

Major foci of UHI mitigation have been to increase the albedo of building roofs 
and facades using high reflectivity titanium dioxide (TiO2) paints and films, and roads 
and  other  paved  surfaces  using  high  albedo  white  cement  (HARC  2004;  Taha  2005). 
Typically,  these  technologies  raise  roof  albedos  from  0.1  to  0.7,  and  paved  surface 
albedos  from  0.1  to  0.4.  Conversion  costs  range  from  15-30  $m-2 for  roofs  and  15-25 
$m-2  for  pavements,  while  the  lifecycle  of  converted  surfaces  are  on  the  order  of  10 
years (HARC 2004). Detailed studies of several urban areas in the United States (Rose 
et  al.  2003)  have  demonstrated,  that  widely  implemented,  these  measures  are  able  to 
increase  baseline  urban  albedos,  characterised  by  values  ranging  from  0.12  –  0.16,  by 
100%  or  more,  to  values  ranging  from  0.20  to  0.37,  depending  on  urban  land  cover 
category  (Taha  2005).  The  100%  enhancement  of  human  settlement  surface  albedos 
postulated  in  scenario  1  thus  appears  technologically  feasible.  Moreover,  human 

 

9

R Hamwey: Active amplification of the terrestrial albedo to mitigate climate change 

settlement  surface  albedos  could  be  enhanced  still  further  if  high  albedo  grasses  are 
used to increase the albedo of lawn surfaces (see below). 

Studies  on  albedo  enhancement  abatement  costs  (i.e.,  as  a  climate  change 
mitigation  measure  in  costs  per  tonne  of  CO2  equivalent  avoided)  would  need  to  be 
completed,  and  estimated  costs  compared  with  other  abatement  options  to  gauge  the 
economic  efficiency  of  any  globally  implemented  measure  to  enhance  the  albedo  of 
human  settlements.  Albedo  enhancement  abatements  costs  should  internalise  the 
economic co-benefits of energy savings and reduced ground level ozone concentrations 
that surface albedo enhancements generate in urban heat islands.  

Measures to increase the reflectance of human settlements may benefit from high 
levels  of  public  acceptability  since,  unlike  energy  conservation  measures,  they  incur 
only periodic fixed costs and do not reduce energy consumption utility. Moreover, with 
increasing  public  awareness  of  climate  change,  the  perceptible  nature  of  albedo 
enhancement activities could encourage widespread community engagement by offering 
local actors a visible way to demonstrate their contribution to climate change mitigation. 
Experience  with  UHI  mitigation  activities  in  the  United  States,  where  they  are  most 
advanced, has been marked by high levels of public support. 

6.2) Scenario 2: Amplification of grassland albedos 

The  substantial  radiative  forcing  offset  yielded  by  enhancing  the  albedo  of  the 
world’s  grasslands  could  make  such  measures  particularly  attractive.  However,  one  of 
the  principal  factors  limiting  the  magnitude  of  plant  albedos,  including  for  grasses,  is 
strong  absorption  of  visible  light  in  the  solar  spectrum  by  chlorophyll  in  plant  leaves. 
Yet  the  possibility  of  increasing  grassland  surface  albedos  with  grasses  having  high 
reflectances  in  the  visible  bandpass  (0.4  –  0.8  µ)  remains  considerable.  Since  the 
reflectance  of  near  infrared  solar  radiation  (0.8  –  1.4  µ)  by  plants  is  relatively  high, 
typically  ranging  from  0.4  –  0.7  (Asner  et  al.  1998;  Asner  1998;  Sims  and  Gamon 
2002), and because the intensity of terrestrial solar radiation drops off substantially in 
the far infrared ( > 1.4 µ) where reflectance by plants is lower, grasslands populated by 
natural  or  bioengineered  grasses  having  increased  visible  band  reflectivities  could 
generate significantly enhanced grassland surface albedos. 

There exist a wide variety of naturally occurring light-coloured shrubs and grasses 
that  exhibit  high  reflectivities  over  the  visible  spectrum.  The  white,  light-green  and 
light-yellow  colouration  of  such  plants  –  i.e.,  increased  reflectance  of  visible  light 
relative  to  visibly  green  plants  –  occurs  through:  1)  low  concentrations  of  chlorophyll 
and  other  pigments  in  plants’  leaves  and  stems  (Sims  and  Gamon  2002)  and/or  2)  the 
presence  of  trichomes  and  waxes  (that  efficiently  reflect  visible  light)  on  plants’  leaf 
surfaces (Bondada and Oosterhuis 2000; Grant et al. 2003). Leaf thickness also plays a 
role in visible reflectance (Knapp and Carter 1998). 

Among  the  first  class  of  plants  are  grasses  such  as  Carex  hachijoensis  and 
Chlorophytum  comosum,  and  shrubs  such  as  Alpinia  zerumbet,  Euonymus  europaeus, 
and Ficus aspera. These plants have variegated leaf colours: patches or stripes of their 
leaves  are  light-yellow  or  white  in  colour  (where  chlorophyll  and  other  pigments  are 
absent or in low concentrations) and green elsewhere. Up to 60% of their leaf surfaces 
are  light-coloured.  Although  uncommon  in  grassland  grasses,  variegated  leaf  colours 
have been observed in Stenotaphrum secundatum (Sud and Dengler 2000).  

The  second  class  of  plants  includes  ‘white-coloured’  shrubs  such  as  Cerastium 
biebersteinii and Senecio cineraria. Dense trichomes on these plants’ surfaces reflect a 

 

10

R Hamwey: Active amplification of the terrestrial albedo to mitigate climate change 

significant fraction of visible light and thus limit the amount that traverses the trichome 
layer  to  become  absorbed  by  chlorophyll  in  the  underlying  leaf.  Trichome-rich  plants 
are  generally  robust  with  a  demonstrated  potential  to  adapt  to  a  wide  range  of  geo-
climatic conditions.  

In addition to exploring grassland albedo enhancement using natural species, the 
potential  of  bioengineering  high  albedo  grass  (and  shrub)  species  with  lowered  leaf 
pigmentation densities and highly reflective leaf surface trichomes and waxes could be 
explored.  However,  as  discussed  below,  leaf  reflectance  is  but  one  of  many  factors 
affecting the surface albedo of grasslands.  

Theoretical  and  observational  studies  of  the  reflective  properties  and  surface 
albedo of vegetation, including of grasslands, continue to be pursued extensively by the 
remote  sensing  community  in  order  to  derive  the  surface  albedo  of  land  surface 
vegetation  –  required  in  climate  models  –  from  satellite  based  spectral  observations 
(Liang  2000).  These  studies  are,  however,  limited  to  dominant,  naturally  occurring 
vegetation  species  that  are  prominent  in  satellite  observations.  Detailed  spectral  and 
albedo  measurements  of  minor  species  are  sparse  in  the  literature,  and  simulated 
spectral and albedo properties of prospective bioengineered vegetation species, such as 
high albedo grasses, are entirely absent.  

The  surface  albedo  of  grasslands  are  influenced  by  a  large  number  of  factors, 
including:  leaf  reflectance,  leaf  morphology,  leaf  area  and  density,  leaf  canopy 
geometry  and  surface  roughness,  and  the  reflective  properties  of  exposed  underlying 
soil. Each of these grass features provides a potential entry-point for research efforts to 
enhance the surface albedo of grasslands.  

a s t
( , )

To  investigate  how  each  of  the  above  factors  influences  the  surface  albedo  of 
grasslands,  it  is  instructive  to  revisit  the  definition  of  surface  albedo.  Specifically,  the 
, at a vegetation element s of the Earth’s surface at time t is the 
surface albedo, 
instantaneous ratio of the total reflected to total incident solar shortwave radiation flux 
at  the  surface.  A  determination  of  surface  albedo  thus  involves  an  integration  of  all 
sources of incident flux (from the sun and sky) and outgoing reflected flux (towards the 
sky)  over  the  entire  skyward  hemisphere  centred  on  s.  Surface  albedo  is  thus  not  an 
invariant property of the surface because it depends on the angular position of the sun, 
as well as the reflective and lifecycle-dependent geometrical properties of the vegetation 
surface, both of which vary temporally.  

While  the  surface  albedos  of  grasslands  are  infinitely  difficult  to  compute 
analytically,  they  are  easy  to  measure  as  a  scalar  quantity  through  field  experiments 
using goniometers. Moreover, angle dependent spectrophotometric observations provide 
information  on  the  angular  distribution  of  reflectance  revealing  the  bidirectional 
reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of a grassland sample (Sandmeier et al 1998). 
The BRDF of an object, which depends on both illumination and viewing angles, is the 
ratio of reflected to incident radiation for a given wavelength λ. Its functional form is:  

BRDF λθ φ θ φ ,

where θ and φ specify the directions of incident (i)  and  reflected  (r)  flux  in  spherical 
coordinates. With knowledge of the BRDF, given any all-sky irradiance distribution, the 
surface  albedo  can  be  determined  by  convolving  irradiance  with  the  BRDF  and 
integrating the over the skyward hemisphere.  

Returning to scenario 2 of this study, it is of interest to postulate how grassland 
surface  albedos  might  be  enhanced  to  ascertain  whether  the  adopted  albedo 

 

11

R Hamwey: Active amplification of the terrestrial albedo to mitigate climate change 

enhancement  factor  of  25%  is  realistic  and  feasible.  Of  the  various  grassland 
characteristics  that  regulate  surface  albedo,  here,  the  effect  of  changing  only  the 
physical reflectance properties of grass leaves by lowering chlorophyll concentrations is 
explored  to  derive  an  estimate  of  the  potential  of  such  a  change  to  raise  grassland 
surface albedo. 

The  BRDF  contains  all  of  the  spectral  and  geometric  reflectance  properties  of  a 
surface element of grassland. Here it is postulated, that in a first approximation, these 
functional  dependences  are  independent  so  that  the  grassland  BRDF  is  separable  and 
can be written as:

where F is a linear function of the solar reflectance spectrum of a representative grass 
leaf  in  the  grassland  canopy  (note  that  if  the  BRDF  was  not  separable,  the  perceived 
‘colour’  of  grass  would  change  with  viewing  angle).  BRDF  separability  is  consistent 
with  recent  high  resolution  remote  sensing  observations  (Barducci  et  al.  2005).  The 
BRDF separability approximation is needed in order to simulate the effect of enhancing 
only the leaf reflectance properties of grassland grasses, while leaving all of grassland 
reflectance properties associated with geometrical features (i.e., leaf area and thickness, 
and canopy geometry and surface roughness) unaffected.

unchanged  from  its  baseline  state.  Accordingly,  the  ratio  of  baseline  to  enhanced 
grassland surface albedo for any grassland surface element in scenario 1 is given simply

Since  an  extensive  search  of  numerous  spectral  libraries  revealed  no  published 
reflectance  spectra  for  shrubs  or  grass  with  variegated  leaf  colours,  a  synthetic  high 
albedo  grass  spectrum  was  constructed.  Using  data  from  the  USGS  Digital  Spectral 
Library  (Clarke  et  al.  2003),  the  synthetic  reflectance  spectrum  was  constructed  as  a 
composite of the reflectance spectra of a typical grassland species, Poa pratensis (40% 
contribution), and a white Petunia petal (60% contribution). Because the Petunia petal 
is  among  the  most  highly  reflective  plant  surfaces,  the  synthetic  reflectance  spectrum 
thus  derived  may  be  considered  as  an  upper  limit  to  the  reflectance  potential  of 
variegated leaf colour high albedo grass.  

The  reflectance  spectra  of  the  baseline  grass  (Poa  pratensis)  and  high  albedo 
grass  (synthetic  composite)  are  displayed  in  Figure  3.  Both  were  convolved  against  a 
standard  all-sky  ground  level  solar  irradiance  spectrum  (ASTM  2003)  in  order  to 
estimate the enhancement of surface albedo generated by a synthetic high albedo grass 
using Eq. 10. An enhancement of 46% was indicated; a value significantly higher than 
the  25%  surface  albedo  increase  postulated  under  scenario  2.  It  may  be  possible  that 

 

12

R Hamwey: Active amplification of the terrestrial albedo to mitigate climate change 

non-synthetic, naturally occurring grasses with variegated leaf colours could also result 
in  albedo  enhancements  of  25%  or  more.  It  is  thus  considered,  that  a  shortwave 
radiative  forcing  reduction  of  0.59  Wm-2  would  be  technically  achievable  for  a 
conversion  of  the  world’s  grasslands  to  a  high  albedo  status.  At  the  same  time,  the 
portion of world grasslands amenable to  conversion would be limited by resource and 
access  constraints,  and  so  a  realistic  reduction  in  radiative  forcing  due  to  enhanced 
grassland albedos would likely be less than the 0.59 Wm-2 calculated here. 

It should be emphasised that should suitable naturally occurring or synthetic high 
albedo  grasses  be  identified,  consideration  of  their  global-scale  introduction  in 
grasslands for climate change mitigation purposes would need to include an appraisal of 
the  economic  costs  of  global  grassland  conversion  and  maintenance.  It  remains  to  be 
demonstrated  that  implementation  costs  per  equivalent  CO2  emissions  reduction  are 
competitive  with  other  mitigation  options.  Moreover,  there  would  be  political 
implications for grassland albedo enhancement. As many of the world’s grasslands are 
in developing countries, international financing and technology transfer mechanisms to 
facilitate their implementation of grassland conversions would be needed to defray the 
likely high costs arising from associated biotechnology intellectual property rights. The 
UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) may provide such a mechanism. 

At  a  more  fundamental  level,  assessments  would  need  to  be  made  of  the  in-situ 
impacts  of  a  large-scale  introduction  of  high  albedo  grasses  on  regional  climates  and 
ecosystems. As discussed in Section 4, their large-scale presence could have appreciable 
regional  climatic  effects  by  modifying  ex  ante  configurations  of  radiative  equilibria, 
evapotranspiration characteristics, convective flow patterns of regional ecosystems, and 
resulting  patterns  of  regional  cloud  cover  and  precipitation.  Reduced  photosynthetic 
activity  due  to  lower  chlorophyll  content  of  high  albedo  grasses,  and  hence  decreased 
carbon  uptake,  may  also  modify  regional  carbon  cycles  slightly.  Although  beyond  the 
scope  of  this  preliminary  inquiry,  a  general  circulation  model  (GCM)  or  regional 
climate model (RCM) would be required to examine these effects.  

In  terms  of  ecological  effects,  modified  grasses  could  perturb  plant-plant  and 
plant-micro-organism  interactions  in  regional  ecosystems,  potentially  altering  baseline 
population  densities  and  geographical  boundaries  of  other  plant  species  in  vegetative 
systems.  Plant-animal  interactions  may  also  be  perturbed,  modifying  predator-prey, 
symbiotic and parasitic relationships, as well as the life-cycle and migration patterns, of 
insects  and  animals.  A  complete  picture  of  potential  ecosystem  effects  would  require 
assessments  of  land  surface  albedo  amplification  impacts  on  biological  dynamics  to 
follow up on RCM results. 

7. Conclusions 

A  static  two  dimensional  radiative  transfer  model  used  in  this  exploratory  study 
suggests  that  active  amplification  of  land  surface  albedo  may  represent  a  potential 
strategy for climate change mitigation that can complement efforts to reduce greenhouse 
gas  emissions.  Preliminary  estimates  that  such  efforts  could  amplify  the  overall  planetary 
albedo enough to offset the current global annual average level of radiative forcing caused by 
anthropogenic  greenhouse  gases  by  as  much  as  30%  or  0.76  Wm-2.  Terrestrial  albedo 
amplification  may  thus  extend,  by  about  25  years,  the  time  available  to  advance  the 
development and use of low-emission energy conversion technologies which ultimately remain 
essential  to  mitigate  long-term  climate  change.  However,  these  results  are  preliminary 
estimates,  serving  only  to  roughly  gauge  the  climate  change  mitigation  potential  of 

 

13

R Hamwey: Active amplification of the terrestrial albedo to mitigate climate change 

active  efforts  to  modify  the  terrestrial  albedo.  Climate  feedbacks  and  feedback  loops 
have not been analysed.  

More  detailed  simulations  are  needed  to  validate  the  estimates  derived  in  this 
study, particularly as improved models (Dai et al. 2003; Tian et al. 2004) and accurate 
high  resolution  surface  albedo  data  (Justice  et  al.  1998;  Schaaf  et  al.  2002)  are  now 
becoming  available.  Higher  resolution  coupled  modelling  using  GCM  and  RCM 
methodologies  and  accurately  measured  location-specific  urban  and  grassland  surface 
albedo  values,  remains  desirable.  Accounting  for  longwave  and  heat  flux  feedbacks, 
such  modelling  would  provide  improved  estimates  of  the  stationary  radiative  forcing 
reduction  that  can  achieved  by  active  amplification  of  the  terrestrial  albedo.  It  would 
also  reveal  the  dynamic  meteorological  effects  of  albedo  amplification  on  regional 
climates.  

Based on improved modelling results, assessments of the climatic and ecological 
impacts,  and  related  socio-economic  impacts,  of  a  large-scale  introduction  of  high 
albedo  human  settlements  and  grasslands  could  be  undertaken.  If  additional  research 
validates  global 
land-surface  albedo  amplification  as  a  viable,  effective  and 
complementary  mitigation  strategy,  future  climate  change  mitigation  efforts  could  be 
strengthened.

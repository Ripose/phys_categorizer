Coherent States on Lie Algebras: A
Constructive Approach

Frank Antonsen

July 22, 2013

Abstract

We generalise the notion of coherent states to arbitrary Lie algebras
by making an analogy with the GNS construction in C ∗-algebras. The
method is illustrated with examples of semisimple and non-semisimple
ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras as well as loop and Kac-Moody alge-
bras.
A deformed addition on the parameter space is also introduced simpli-
fying some expressions and some applications to conformal ﬁeld theory
is pointed out, e.g. are diﬀerential operator and free ﬁeld realisations
found.

1 Introduction

For the harmonic oscillator one can deﬁne coherent states, i.e. states which
are eigenstates of the creation operator a†, see e.g.
[1]. These are given by

we can construct its Bargmann kernel, ˜A, which is then a function of two

For fermionic degrees of freedom, one would deﬁne coherent states in a simi-
lar way, but with the complex parameter z replaced by a Grassmann number
η, [1].
Now, the harmonic oscillator is but one particularly simple example of a
physical system described by a Lie algebra.

which is the simplest non-trivial semisimple Lie algebra.
Generalisations to other semisimple Lie algebras have been made in the past,
[4]. One considers a (usually compact) Lie group G acting on some space X.
x
Starting with a ﬁducial vector
i
where T is the appropriate representation. The geometric setting for this
is the Borel-Weil-Bott construction, see e.g. [5]. One ﬁrst considers G as a
ﬁbre bundle over G/H with ﬁber H, and then constructs a holomorphic line
S1, λ a highest weight. The Peter-Weyl
bundle Lλ from a map λ : H
→
theorem then states that L2(G)
V ∗
λ , where Vλ denotes the set of
≃ ⊕λVλ ⊗
cross sections of the line bundle Lλ, i.e. Vλ = Γ(Lλ). The functions in Vλ
are annihilated by elements of G−, the Lie group of the algebra g− given
by a root decomposition with respect to h the Lie algebra of H (the Cartan
algebra).
We want to propose a simple, constructive and natural procedure which ap-
plies to non-semisimple Lie algebras and to Kac-Moody algebras too. Let us
note that the deﬁnition of a coherent state depended on the following ingre-
dients: (1) a root decomposition (in order to specify the creation operators),

, in the corresponding vector
(2) a representation, and (3) a vacuum state,
space (the Fock space). It is natural to attempt to construct all of this out of
the structure of the algebra itself. In this way it becomes similar to the GNS
construction known from operator algebras, in which one uses the structure of the
algebra (C ∗ or just Banach),
, with a
natural cyclic vector (i.e. the vacuum state) denoted by ξ, such that
ξ (the
algebra generate the Hilbert space) and

2 The Construction

We will generalise the root decomposition in the following way. Suppose we can
write the Lie algebra (as a vector space) as

with

⇒
} ≡
α, or with e.g.
Hence we will allow roots α without a corresponding mirror image
2α also a root. We will also allow more than one linearly independent generator
in each gα.
Roots which satisfy the usual requirements (each root space having dimension one,
1, 0) will be called proper, and will thus generate a
and nα a root only if n =
semisimple sub-algebra, whereas the remaining roots will be called pseudo roots.
For Kac-Moody algebras the real roots are then proper whereas the imaginary ones
are pseudo roots (but each space gα is one dimensional). In this case the proper
roots span the corresponding ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra.
As for semisimple Lie algebras we will draw the roots as vectors in some (for ﬁnite
dimensional algebras) ﬁnite dimensional space. If there is more than one indepen-
dent generator in a given gα then the corresponding arrow is drawn diﬀerently:
if dim gα = 2 then we will draw the arrow as
3 we will
include the dimensionality as a subscript,

These are of course Abelian. For an example of a non-Abelian algebra, consider
the Heisenberg algebra in a one-dimensional space, h1, this is drawn as

where dim g1 = 2 and dim g2 = 1, [g1, g1] = g2. Here g0 ≡
0 and there are no
negative roots, all roots are pseudo roots, denoted by 1, 2. One should note that for
non-semisimple Lie algebras the root-decomposition will in general be non-unique.
An alternative decomposition for h1 would have been g−1 ⊕
g1 with each
component being one dimensional; g−1 = Fp, g0 = F(i~1), g1 = Fq. This latter
choice however would obscure the very strong diﬀerence between the nilpotent
algebra h1 and the semisimple one A1. We have chosen the decomposition which
most clearly brings out this diﬀerence between the two algebras.

g1 where g0 = Ff and g1 = Fe. The root

We conjecture that all ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras can be treated in this manner.
Consider extensions of a semisimple Lie algebra, say A1 = sl2 = su2 = so3 for
simplicity. Some of the ways of extending it by pseudo roots are shown in table
1. The Jacobi identity ﬁxes most of the algebraic relations uniquely, and the
corresponding Lie algebras are listed in the table too.
The second example in the table, the one where the new generators are es, es±r,
will be called the fan algebra, because of the shape of the root diagram, and will be
the standard example together with the Heisenberg algebra of a non-semisimple
Lie algebra. We will denote the fan algebra by f3(A1) or just f3, the subscript 3
refering to the three extra roots we have added to A1, namely es, es±r. Similarly
one can deﬁne f2n+1(A1), for n
Now given a Lie algebra g, in order to deﬁne coherent states, we must ﬁrst of

all ﬁnd a natural vector space for it to act upon. The obvious choice is the
underlying vector space of the algebra, i.e. the algebra itself. The corresponding
representation is the adjoint one. Furthermore, the roots (proper as well as pseudo)
lying in ∆+ are the natural candidates for creation operators. Note, however, that
for pseudo roots it is purely a matter of convention whether one includes a root in
∆+ or in ∆−. The two diﬀerent choices are each other’s duals.
The basic ingredient is then the element

xα(ζ) = eζad eα

It turns out that this quantity is important in its own right, as it generates what
is known as the Chevalley group, see [3]. In order to deﬁne a vector
we must

specify a “vacuum state”,
of the GNS construction, must satisfy

in words: the vacuum is annihilated by the elements corresponding to negative
roots (the annihilation operators), is an eigenvector of elements of g0 (the gen-
eralised Cartan algebra, the “number operators”) and generates the entire vetor
space when acted upon by elements of gα, α
∆+. This is the Lie algebra ana-
logue of the GNS construction for operator algebras.

where the superscript t denotes transpose. It is this deﬁnition we will choose. For
semisimple Lie algebras the two deﬁnitions coincide.
These coherent states are over-complete and we deﬁne

p(¯ζ, ζ ′) :=

i

(18)

Then p is some polynomial when the algebra is semisimple and a holomorphic
function otherwise (for semisimple Lie algebras the adjoint representation is nilpo-
tent, so the exponentials are ﬁnite order polynomials). One should also note that
the coherent states are not normalised. This can simply be done by dividing by

p(¯ζ, ζ).

A particular important subject to study is central extensions. Suppose we have a
p
Fc, we then would like
Lie algebra, g, and then form a central extension ˜g = g
to know how coherent states for g are related to those of ˜g. Write the algebraic
relations of the centrally extended algebra as

⊕

[eα, eβ] = Nα,βeα+β + cαβ
[eα, fα] = αihi + cα,−α
αieα + cαi
[eα, hi] =

We will explicitly construct the coherent states for all four seimisimple Lie algebras
of rank at most two, i.e. A1, A2, B2, G2, and also make some general statements.

This is not the same as the standard coherent states for the harmonic oscillator,
(1), because we are using the adjoint representation which is nilpotent, i.e.
p :
(a†)p = 0. The standard coherent states corresponds to p =
, which makes the
algebra into a C ∗-algebra (the bilateral shift algebra). The next algebras are the
so4, G2. In these simple cases
three rank two simple Lie algebras A2 ≃
we can actually also compute the exponential of the adjoint representation quite
easily.

In this case the normalisation polynomial becomes of ﬁfth order in each variable,
but will not be written out explicitly (the Mathematica output is 37 pages long!).
Before we close this section we will make some general comments. The normal-
isation polynomials can be expressed in terms of the structure constants Nr,s,
the Cartan matrix Ars and the coeﬃcients in the Baker-Campbel-Hausdorﬀ series
which we’ll denote by bi. There is some subtlety involved in this, as even though

Notice that p is independent of ζs.
Let us summarise our experiences with non-semisimple Lie algebras so far. First
we have noticed that central elements will not contribute to the ad e or ad f
terms, but at most through the commutators, i.e. only if they can be written as
g, (hence if and only if the central element c lies in the derived
c = [g1, g2], g1, g2 ∈
subalgebra g′ = [g, g]). Secondly we notice that the normalisation polynomial need
not depend on all the variables, ζα. The example of the “fan algebra”, f3, showed
this quite clearly. The normalisation polynomial will, however, always depend on
all the proper roots, since these span a semisimple subalgebra. In general variables
Z(g),
ζα corresponding to a gα
where Z(g) denotes the center of the Lie algebra. For a semisimple algebra g′ = g
and Z(g) = 0 so all variables will appear.

g′ = [g, g] will contribute, unless of course gα

2.3 Loop and Kac-Moody Algebras

Since this construction is based directly on the roots and the corresponding struc-
ture constants and Cartan matrices it is quite natural to attempt an extension to
Kac-Moody algebras. Recall, [6], that these can be deﬁned in terms of generalised
Cartan matrices as follows. An n
n matrix A is called a generalised Cartan
matrix if it satisﬁes

Furthermore, for the particularly simple case of aﬃne Kac-Moody algebras, the set

n = 1, 2, ...
}
Such inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras can be represented as central extensions of
loop algebras. Thus it seems advantageous to begin by considering loop algebras.
Given a ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra, semisimple or not, g, we form its loop
g, by deﬁning the generators en

where ǫ(w, I) is some number taking care of the possible multiplicity. In concrete

But since we do not have any more concrete deﬁnition of neither
, W nor ∆im,
we will not be able to do more here.
As a ﬁnal comment, x(ζ) for Kac-Moody algebras is closely related to (generalised)
screening operators, [8]. One considers an algebra with generators eα, fα, hi as
usual, in some representation (always the adjoint representation in our case, just
some formal representation in conformal ﬁeld theory, CFT). Let

the new coherent states following from this and ﬁnally the use of the structure

with k some constant and f an arbitrary function, we get the more familiar re-
alisation p = ∂ + ¯ζk, q = ¯∂

to emphasise the analogy with complex analysis. This particular realisation also
clearly shows the Heisenberg algebra as a central extension of an abelian Lie alge-
bra.

Once one has the analogy with creation and annihilation operators (the root
decomposition) and furthermore the realisation in terms of diﬀerential operators
acting on some “Fock space” (through the coherent states), it is obvious to look
for realisations in terms of quantum ﬁelds, too.
In analogy with CFT we will then look for free ﬁeld realisations of g, i.e. look for
Γ is an element
(bosonic) ﬁelds φi(ξ) and (bosonic) ghosts βα(ξ), γα(ξ), where ξ

α is a possible anomalous term. For aﬃne Kac-Moody algebras this

can be found in the reference)

The only diﬀerence in our case is the explicit appearance of the adjoint represen-
tation instead of some formal exponential, exeα.
For ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras, we will expect dim Γ
1, i.e. we have a zero or
one dimensional ﬁeld theory. For non-aﬃne Kac-Moody algebras we would expect
2, but we wont be able to prove this. Due to a lack of knowledge about
dim Γ
non-aﬃne Kac-Moody algebras we will restrict ourselves to ﬁnite dimensional Lie
algebras, semisimple or not.
Consider then a ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebra g. We want to write down a free
ﬁeld realisation `a la Wakimoto for this. The parameter space Γ will be taken to
be the discrete set Z, i.e. dim Γ = 0. The analogy with the OPE’s of the aﬃne
Kac-Moody algebra case is then

delta, it is merely a “reproducing kernel” in the sense that it acts like a Kronecker
delta

In analogy with the aﬃne Kac-Moody algebra case we have not written the “non-

k > 0.

The question is then whether anomalous contributions come into play like they do
in the inﬁnite dimensional case. In fact they have to, for the very same reasons
as in the inﬁnite dimensional case, namely because of the λi part of Fα, which
becomes proportional to the bosonic ﬁeld φi in the Wakimoto realisation. An
extra term is then needed to compensate for the φiφj contribution to the OPE’s,
i.e.
it must contain a δγ-contribution. Straightforward computation yields the
same result as for the aﬃne Kac-Moody algebra case, since this only uses the root
decomposition.

4 Conclusion

We have generalised the notion of coherent states from the harmonic oscillator
using an analogy with the GNS-construction for C ∗-algebras. The resulting pro-
cedure is constructive and allowed us to handle not only semisimple Lie algebras,
but also non-semisimple ones even those corresponding to non-compact Lie groups
such as su(1, 1), so(2, 1), so(3, 1) etc. Furthermore aﬃne as well as non-aﬃne Kac-
Moody algebras could be treated with this procedure too.
The only ingredient in the procedure is the Lie algebra structure, put more pre-
cisely, a root decomposition, the structure constants Nr,s and the Cartan matrix.
The representation used was the natural one, i.e. the adjoint representation acting

22

⊗

on the underlying vector space of the algebra.
In this way, a coherent state becomes a vector-valued function, and the set of these
states are C((ζ))
Fd, with d = dim g, for ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras, whereas
for aﬃne Kac-Moody and loop algebras formed from some ﬁnite dimensional Lie
Fd, i.e. the corre-
algebra g, the set of coherent states span C∞(S1)
sponding loop space.
The advantage of the proposed construction is the nilpotency of the adjoint rep-
resentation, for semisimple algebras, making the space of coherent states ﬁnite
dimensional, namely simply C(ζ)
We ﬁnally deﬁned diﬀerential operator and free ﬁeld realisations of the algebras in
analogy with what is done for aﬃne Kac-Moody algebras in conformal ﬁeld theory.

Introduction 

 

 

 

As has been pointed  out by Berry[1], the concept of phase is an abstract one, and 

the  idea  of  a  singularity  perhaps  more  so,  so  that  a  singularity  in  phase  is  a  double 

abstraction.  Besides,  even  the  fact  that  light  has  an  oscillating  or  wave  nature  at  all  is  not 

often  obvious. It is therefore particularly gratifying that optical phase singularities, which at 

first were experienced only rather negatively as dark spots or indirectly through defects in 

interference  patterns,  have  in  recent  times  been  shown  to  be  tangible  enough  to exert 

mechanical forces capable of rotating and moving small objects about. Of course, the forces 

are  exerted  by  the  light  field  surrounding  the  singularity  but  their  characteristics  are 

determined by the characteristic radial increase in irradiance and  by the helical nature of the 

wavefronts associated with the singularity (the optical vortex), which can therefore be held 

responsible for the effects. 

 

The fact that light carries energy, momentum, and angular momentum has been well 

understood since the work of Maxwell (1873) but the small sizes of the associated forces, 

together  with  the  interference  of  spurious  effects  such  as  radiometer,  thermophoretic  and 

photophoretic effects in low pressure gases, made direct measurements difficult. Lebedev[2] 

and  Nichols  and  Hull[3]  were  probably  the  first  to  make  measurements  of  radiation 

pressure,  while  in  a  well-known  experiment,  Beth[4]  measured  the  angular  momentum 

carried by circularly polarized light.

Recently  a  microscopic  parallel  of  Beth’s  experiment  was  carried  out.  In  this 

experiment, the angular momentum carried by circularly-polarized light in a Gaussian beam 

was transferred to a microscopic fragment of birefringent material causing it to rotate[5]. 

The  issue  of  the  mechanical  effects  of  optical  vortices was first raised in 1992 by 

Allen  et  al.[6]  .  They  pointed  out  that  Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) laser modes carry angular 

momentum associated with their optical vortices and proposed an experiment reminiscent of 

that of Beth to observe transfer of the vortex  angular momentum to a macroscopic object. 

On  the  basis  of  classical  electromagnetic  theory,  they  showed  that  the  ratio  of  angular 

momentum flux to energy flux for a LG mode of order l can be written as

where  sz =  – 1  for  left-handed  or  right-handed  circularly  polarized  light  and  sz = 0 for 

linearly  polarized  light,  and  P  is  the  linear  momentum  density.  This  can  be  conveniently 

interpreted as each photon of energy  hw carrying  sz quanta of “spin” angular momentum 

associated with the polarization state and l quanta of “orbital” angular momentum associated 

with the spatial distribution of the field, each quantum having magnitude h. 

Abramochken and Volostrukov[7] had shown that LG modes could be converted 

to  Hermite-Gaussian  and  back  by  passing  through  mode  converters  of  two  cylindrical 

lenses. Such converters have been well studied and have since found several uses[8,9,10]. 

In  the  experiment  proposed  by  Allen  et  al.[11],  which  was  to  show  that  a  laser 

mode  carries  angular  momentum  associated  with  its  optical  vortex,  a  pair  of  cylindrical 

lenses suspended on a torsion fibre would reverse the helicity of a LG beam and suffer a 

reaction torque. However, this torque is very small for reasonable power beams and it has 

turned out to be easier to measure such effects on a more microscopic scale in the context 

of optical trapping experiments as discussed below. 

Optical  trapping  is  achieved  through  forces  arising  from  exchange  of  momentum 

between incident light and the trapped object. The local flow of momentum in the light field 

is in the direction of the local Poynting vector and hence perpendicular to the wavefronts. 

Since optical vortices have wavefronts which are helical and therefore inclined to the axis of 

propagation of the beam they can apply circumferential forces and hence torques about the

beam axis. It is in this way that angular momentum is transferred to some object from the 

beam. 

The LG modes are only paraxial solutions of the wave-equation, but optical trapping 

experiments are carried out with strongly focussed, and therefore non-paraxial, light beams. 

In this case it is not in principle permissible to separate the angular momentum of a beam into 

independent orbital and spin components. This problem has been considered by Barnett and 

Allen[12] who have derived a correction term which is fortunately negligibly small in most 

cases of interest. 

Other evidence for vortex angular momentum comes from experiments where LG 

beams have been used in second harmonic generation[13,9], in which LG beams of twice 

the order, corresponding to twice the angular momentum per photon were produced. This is 

consistent  with  a  picture  where  two  photons  combine  to  form  one  with  twice  the  energy, 

twice the momentum, and twice the angular momentum, satisfying the conservation law for 

each quantity. 

In this chapter we concentrate on the forces and torques exerted on transparent and 

absorbing particles trapped in laser beams containing optical vortices. We review previous 

theoretical and experimental work and then present new calculations of the effect of vortex 

beams on absorbing particles. 

1.  Optical vortices in trapping experiments 

1.1 

The  use  of  optical  vortex  modes  to  trap  high  refractive  index  transparent 

particles 

As early as 1974, Ashkin and Dziedzic[14] showed that a TEM*

01 laser mode could 

be used to stably levitate various types of spheres. Although there is no guarantee that the 

mode  was  not  an  incoherent  superposition  of  TEM01 and  TEM10  modes  with  different 

frequencies and hence not strictly  a vortex, it might have been, at least some of the time. 

Their  paper  describes  levitation  of  solid  transparent  spheres  in  a  single  vertically  upward 

propagating doughnut beam, and levitation of hollow transparent and metallic spheres using 

a  combination  of  two  counter-propagating  beams  and  one  vertically  upward  beam.

However,  until  the  advent  of  the  single-beam  gradient  optical  trap[15],  manipulation  of 

microscopic objects using laser beams was not a truly practicable reality. 

 

In a single-beam optical gradient trap, one laser beam is focussed in such a way as 

to produce a 3-dimensional trapping potential. In most commonly used experimental set-ups 

for a single-beam optical trap, the laser beam is directed through a high numerical aperture 

(NA »

 1.3) 100·

 objective lens. The beam is shaped in such a way as to ensure filling of the 

back pupil of the objective lens in order to achieve the tightest possible focus at (or near) the 

specimen plane. High numerical aperture is very important as it enables maximization of the 

light  intensity  gradient  near  the  focal  plane,  providing  the  most  stable  trapping  in  the  axial 

direction. 

 

The  minimum  focal  spot  size  (of  the  order  of  1-2  mm)  and  maximum  intensity 

gradient result in the strongest trapping force on an object to be trapped and manipulated. 

An object to be trapped is usually suspended in an appropriate solution, a drop of which is 

placed between a microscope slide and coverslip. Imaging of the particle and trap is most 

often  performed  through  the  same  lens  that  is  used  to  bring  the  beam  to  a  focus,  either 

through  microscope  eyepieces  or  a  CCD  camera.  A  variety  of  lasers  has  been  used  for 

trapping, such as He-Ne, CW Nd-YAG and Ti-Sapphire lasers with powers ranging from a 

few to hundreds of mW. 

 

Often the laser beam is directed into a commercially available microscope and only 

minor  modifications  are  needed  in  order  to  perform  laser  micromanipulation.  In  most 

experiments, the trapped specimen has to be moved with respect to the rest of the sample. 

This can be achieved either by moving the trap itself or by moving the specimen, the simplest 

option  being  to  move  the  microscope  stage,  causing  the  entire  sample  to  move  while  the 

trapped particle remains stationary with respect to the objective. More complicated options 

include  setups  where  the  direction  of  the  beam  entering  the  back  pupil  of  the  objective  is 

controlled, allowing the trap to be moved while the sample remains stationary. 

 

The  efficiency  of  the  trap  can  be  most  simply  described  by  a  radial  and  an  axial 

trapping efficiency, which are commonly measured by determining the maximum velocity at 

which the particle can be dragged through the surrounding fluid and still remain trapped by a 

given  laser  output  power,  or  by  measuring  the  effective  force  constants.  Radial  trapping 

Heckenberg et al. Mechanical effects of optical vortices 

5 

efficiency is in general higher than axial efficiency (2  - 3 times greater for glass spheres 1  - 

10 mm in diameter[16]). 

 

Wright  et  al.[17]  were  the  first  to  model  the  optical  tweezers  trapping  efficiency 

using  a  ray  optics  approach.  A  similar  model was used by Ashkin[18], who showed that 

within a ray optics model, rays with a high convergence angle (around 70(cid:176) ) contribute more 

to the trapping force than those from the center of the beam. This leads to the postulate that 

a beam with a central dark spot (for example a TEM*

01 doughnut beam) may provide more 

efficient trapping. Usually the “scattering force” acting downwards tends to push the particle 

away  from  the  beam  focus,  counteracting  the  trapping.  A  beam  with  a  central  dark  spot 

reduces this force, improving axial trapping. 

Ashkin's investigation of trapping efficiency for TEM00 and TEM*

01 laser beams and 

particles large compared to the wavelength showed that a TEM*

01 beam achieves better on-

axis  trapping  (around  25%  better  than  a  Gaussian  beam  of  the  same  spot-size having the 

same  power),  but  the  radial  trapping  efficiency  of  a  doughnut  beam  is  calculated  to  be 

around 10% less than that of an equivalent Gaussian beam. 

As  optical  tweezers  are  primarily  used  to  manipulate  live  biological  materials, 

achieving  the  most  efficient  trapping  system  has  long  been  a  concern,  to  minimize  the 

possibility  of  damage  to  the  specimen.  Recent  work  by  Friese  at  al.[19]  and  Simpson  et 

al.[20] has shown that the prediction of greater axial trapping efficiency using TEM*

01 beams 

is  indeed  correct,  and  that  by  using  Laguerre-Gaussian  modes  of  various  orders,  axial 

trapping efficiency can be increased by several times[21]. However, the predicted decrease 

in radial trapping efficiency is to our knowledge yet to be verified. 

1.2 

The use of LG modes to trap non-transparent or low-index particles 

Although the use of optical vortices in biological and biophysics research is as yet 

uncommon, doughnut beams and other hollow beam arrangements have been widely used to 

manipulate non-transparent (both absorptive and reflective) and low-index (refractive index 

lower than their surrounding medium) particles. The early work of Ashkin and Dziedzic[14] 

and Roosen and Imbert[22] , who manipulated reflective particles using counter-propagating 

doughnut  beams,  was  followed  by  experiments  with  various  types  of  single-beam optical 

 

 

 

 

 

Heckenberg et al. Mechanical effects of optical vortices

trap.  These  traps  all  use  an  arrangement  similar  to  the  single-beam gradient trap:  a single 

laser beam is focussed to a waist on the order of one wavelength across using a high NA 

microscope objective. Axial forces due to absorption or back reflection of light preclude 3-

dimensional trapping, but particles can be confined 2-dimensionally against a substrate like a 

microscope  slide.  These  trapped  objects  can  then  be  manipulated  in  one  plane  only,  as 

opposed to the 3-dimensional trapping effect of the single-beam gradient trap. 

 

Beams  with  central  intensity  minima  have  been  employed  to  trap  non-transparent 

and  low-index  particles  because  simple  theory  predicts  that  these  particles  cannot  be 

trapped in the usual Gaussian beam. The same ray optics model used to explain high-index 

particle  trapping  shows  that  low-index particles are repelled from intensity maxima, and a 

similar  theory  was  used  to  show  that  reflective  particles would suffer similar effects[23]. 

Experiments showed that strongly absorbing particles could also be trapped in a doughnut 

beam[24]. It has since been shown theoretically and practically that both reflective[25] and 

absorptive[26,27]  particles  can  in  fact  be  trapped  2-dimensionally without a central dark 

spot  (although  trapping  is  less  stable  than  in  a  doughnut  beam),  and  also  that  some  very 

small metallic particles around 10 nm in size can even be trapped 3-dimensionally in a single-

beam  gradient  trap[28] as they are small enough to experience some induced polarization 

effects.  However,  doughnut  modes  are  by  far  the  most  commonly  used  beams  for 

manipulation  of  these  types  of  particles,  although  other  arrangements  such  as  the  circular 

scanning  of  a  laser  beam  around  a  particle[23]  have  also  been  successful.  Low-index 

particles (2-dimensional trapping of bubbles[29] and 3-dimensional trapping of hollow glass 

spheres[30]),  metal  particles[25,24]  and  absorbing  particles[31,32,33]  have  also  been 

trapped using TEM*

01 laser beams. However, in most cases, the reason for employing these 

modes  has  been  to  utilize  the  central  intensity  minimum,  rather  than  any  other  interesting 

properties of the beam. Recently though there has been an increasing interest in using optical 

traps to investigate these properties, and to observe their effects on microscopic particles. 

 

 

 

1.3 

Trapping absorbing particles with LG modes 

The  first  experimental  evidence  of  the  mechanical  effects  of  the  orbital  angular 

momentum  of  LG  modes  was  the optically  induced  rotation of black ceramic particles  of 

Heckenberg et al. Mechanical effects of optical vortices 

7 

around 1  - 2  mm  diameter,  while  they  were  trapped  in  a  highly  focussed  doughnut  beam 

produced  using  computer-generated holograms[31]. The main evidence cited in this work 

was the dependence of  the sense of rotation of the particles on the sense of the helicity of 

the vortex. In a similar experiment[32] a Dove prism was included in the optical path. The 

removal of the Dove prism reversed the helicity of the beam: the purpose of this arrangement 

was to observe the sense of rotation of a given particle as the helicity changed direction. A 

reversal  of  the  rotation  direction  was  observed,  further  evidence  that  the  particle  rotation 

was caused by the optical vortex. 

 

Other experiments along similar lines have demonstrated the mechanical equivalence 

of  optical  angular  momentum  associated  with  polarization  and  optical  vortices.  As  was 

mentioned  in  the  introduction,  Barnett  and  Allen[12]  calculated  that  a  polarized  charge  l 

Laguerre-Gaussian beam carries angular momentum (l + sz)h per photon in the paraxial limit 

(where sz is – 1 and 0 for circularly- and plane-polarized light respectively). Friese et al.[33] 

showed  that  an  absorbing  particle  rotating  with  frequency  f  while  trapped  in  a  charge  3 

Laguerre-Gaussian mode speeds up to a frequency 4/3f when the beam is made circularly-

polarized  with  the  same  sense  as  the  vortex,  and  slows  down  to  2/3f when the beam  is 

circularly-polarized the opposite way. 

A  similar  experiment  was  reported  by  Simpson  et  al.[20]  using  a  charge  one 

doughnut beam, showing that the torque due to the beam helicity could be cancelled out by 

the torque due to circular polarization of the opposite sense. 

2. 

Calculation of optical forces 

The forces exerted on particles by a laser beam depend on the properties of both 

the  beam  and  the  particle.  A  number  of  distinct  mechanisms  act  when  light  is  incident  on 

particles of different types, such as gradient forces acting on transparent particles and atoms, 

and the transfer of momentum through absorption of photons from the beam. These different 

types of particles will be considered separately. 

While  a  non-paraxial beam is necessary for effective laser trapping, the use of the 

paraxial  approximation  is  convenient,  and  does  not  seem  to  introduce  excessive error. 

Errors due to aberration within the optical system are expected to be greater.

2.1 

Description of the laser beam 

The most common type of phase singular laser beam used for trapping is a 

Laguerre-Gaussian  doughnut  beam  LGpl  (described  by  a  radial  mode  index  p  and  an 

azimuthal mode index, or charge,  l). The radial mode index  p is equal to zero for doughnut 

beams  used  for  trapping.  Beams  with  azimuthal  mode  indices  of  l = 1 to  l = 3 are most 

common. Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the beam, it is convenient to use a cylindrical 

coordinate system, with radial, azimuthal and axial coordinates r, f and z and corresponding 

unit  vectors  .  In  this  coordinate  system,  the  linear  momentum  flux  of  a  LGpl laser beam is 

given by the time-averaged Poynting vector, S,

The trapping of transparent particles can be well understood in terms of gradient (or 

refractive or polarization) forces and scattering (including reflection and absorption) forces. 

The gradient forces are proportional to the intensity gradient, while the scattering forces are 

proportional to the intensity (thus the importance of having a highly convergent beam). These 

forces  depend  strongly  on  the  composition  of  the  trapped  particle  and  the  surrounding 

medium. 

electric field E is 

The gradient force is due to the spatial variation of the interaction energy between 

the electric field of the incident beam and the induced polarization due to this field within the

For  a  small  particle,  with  an  approximately  constant  time-averaged electric field, 

calculation of the total force is straightforward, but for a larger particle, which will affect the 

intensity distribution of the beam, the case is more complicated. 

The  total  force  acting  on  a  particle  can  be  written  in  terms  of  a  macroscopic

Provided that the gradient force is sufficient to overcome the scattering forces, the 

particle  is  attracted  towards  the  highest  intensity  regions  of  the  beam.  As  a  result,  the 

equilibrium  position  of  particles  trapped  in  a  Laguerre-Gaussian  beam  depends  on the 

relative size of the beam and the particles (see figure 1).

2.3 

Absorbing and reflective particles 

 

Absorbing  and  reflective  particles  are  trapped  (two-dimensionally)  through  the 

transfer of momentum from the beam; as photons are absorbed from the beam or reflected 

by a particle, momentum, angular momentum and energy are transferred from the beam to 

the particle. The forces acting  on such particles can be calculated readily, as the difference 

between the incident and outgoing momenta is transferred to the particle. 

Development of a useful general model for calculation of forces acting on reflective 

particles  presents  some  difficulty, as the geometry of the particle affects the directions into 

which  reflection  occurs.  For  clarity,  only  the  simpler  case  of  absorbing  particles  will  be 

considered in detail below. If a particle is highly absorbing, all of the energy and momentum 

carried by the portion of the beam intercepted by the particle will be absorbed. The resultant 

optical  forces  depend  less  on  the  optical  properties  and  shape  of  the  particle  than  when 

transparent or reflective particles are trapped. The primary consideration is the geometry of 

the beam.

2.3.1  Microscopic transfer of momentum and energy 

The  transfer  of  momentum  from  the  laser  beam  to  an  absorbing  particle  can  be 

readily  understood  in  terms  of  the  absorption  of  photons  from  the  beam.  A  small  area 

element  dA  of  a  highly  absorbing  particle  experiences  a  force  (i.e.  a  rate  of  momentum 

transfer) given by the Poynting vector: 

Reflective particles will redirect rather than absorb this momentum, so the force acting on a 

reflective particle will be

In this case, the direction of the resultant force depends on the orientation of the surface. An 

absorbing  area  element  dA  will  also  absorb  angular  momentum  if  the  beam  is  circularly 

polarized,  with  each  photon  having  angular  momentum  of  magnitude  h.  The  rate  of 

absorption of angular momentum by a small section of the particle is given in terms of the 

Poynting vector S and the wavenumber k by

where sz = – 1 for left- and right-circular polarization and sz = 0 for plane polarization. The

It  will  usually  be  necessary to integrate the Poynting vector over the surface of the 

absorbing particle in order to extend this microscopic momentum and energy transfer to the 

particle  as  a  whole.  The  calculation  can  be  readily  performed  numerically  by  dividing  the 

particle into a number of small area elements  dA over each of which the Poynting vector is 

approximately  constant,  and  integrating  equation  11.  Only  the  illuminated  surface  of  the

particle  (i.e.  where  the  product  S(cid:215) (-dA)  <  0)  needs  to  be  considered.  A  useful 

approximation  is  to  simply  represent  the  particle  as  a  disk  with  the  same  cross-section, 

essentially  applying  the  paraxial  approximation  to  the  illumination  of  the  particle  (note  that 

this cannot be applied to most reflective particles).

the trapping of the particle (which can only be trapped in the region where the radial force is 
negative i.e. restoring) while the azimuthal force causes orbital motion of the particle about the 
centre of the trap. As the beam in this case is plane-polarized, the torque about the beam axis 
is  due  to  the  azimuthal  force  only,  while  for  a  circularly-polarized  beam,  the  torque  due  to 
absorption of angular momentum carried by the photon spin is also important. 
 

It can be seen that the transfer of angular momentum due to polarization results in a 

torque acting on the particle. The transfer of linear momentum results in a force acting on the 

particle,  and  in  most  cases,  a  torque  as  well.  The  distinction  between  spin  angular 

momentum due to the polarization and orbital angular momentum due to the helical structure 

of the beam is clearly shown by the differences in the ways in which they act on the particle.

2.4.1  Trapping 

Equilibrium points in these force fields exist only where the total force is zero, and a 

particle can be trapped only at a stable equilibrium point. Thus, it can be readily seen that an 

absorbing  particle  cannot  be  axially  trapped  without  an  external  force  (such  as  gravity, 

viscous drag due to convection, or a reaction force due to the particle resting on the bottom 

of the trapping cell) acting on it. 

The particle can be trapped radially in the portion of the beam which is converging 

towards  the  beam  waist.  The  particle  cannot  be  trapped  after  the  beam  waist,  as  the 

convergence of the beam required for trapping no longer exists. The absorbing particle trap 

can therefore be considered to be a two-dimensional trap. 

The  trapping  of  reflective  particles  depends  on  the  shape  of  the  particle  as  the 

direction  of  optical  force  depends  on  the  direction  of  the  normal  to  the  surface  of  the 

particle. Spherical particles, with the normal of the illuminated surface directed away from 

the centre of the trap, will be trapped. Disk-shaped particles, with the normal for most of the 

surface  directed  parallel  to  the  beam  axis,  will  only  experience  a  trapping  force  due  to 

reflection from the edges (see figure 3). The trapping in this case will be strongly dependent 

on the thickness of the particle, and will occur before the focus as in the case of absorbing 

particles. The force component responsible for trapping is denoted in the figure by Fr.

on its shape. If the total force does not include an inward radial component, the particle will

As the particle is trapped, the torque acting on it will cause the particle to rotate on

Figure 4 shows spin rates calculated for typical experiments where rotation rates of 

a  few  Hz  are  observed.  As  the  particle  size  is  increased,  more  angular  momentum  is 

absorbed  until  the particle is larger than the beam. Any further increase in radius increases 

the drag without increasing the optical torque, leading to a decrease in rotation speed.

The  temperature  reached  by  the  particle  is  of  interest,  as  convective  flow  of  the 

medium around the particle could exert a force on it. If damage to trapped particles is to be 

minimized,  the  temperature  rise  should  be  kept  as  low  as  possible.  Under  other 

circumstances, heating of the particle might be a desired effect. 

Due to the small surface area of typical trapped particles, radiative loss of energy 

will be insignificant. As the length scales  involved are very small, and convective fluid flow 

velocities  will  be  small,  the  loss  of  heat  through  thermal  conduction  will  predominate,  and 

heat transport through convection will be insignificant[27]. 

For  a  spherical  particle  losing  the  heat  absorbed  from  the  beam  by  isotropic 

conduction into a surrounding medium of thermal conductivity  k, the radial variation of the 

temperature T in the surrounding medium is given by

where  T0  is  the  background  temperature  of  the  medium.  While  most biological samples 

suffer  only  small  temperature  rises  due  to  their  relative  transparency,  strongly  absorbing 

particles can experience very high temperatures. As shown in figure 5, large particles more 

readily lose heat by conduction, while small particles absorb little energy from the beam, so 

maximum rises are experienced by particles just large enough to absorb most of the beam 

power.

3. 

Comparison with trapping in Gaussian laser beams 

 

TEM00  Gaussian  laser  beams  are  easily  produced,  and  are  often  used  for  laser 

trapping  and  manipulation.  Both  Gaussian  and  LG  beams  can  be  used  to  trap  either 

absorbing or transparent particles, but the resultant properties of the traps differ somewhat. 

In particular, a Gaussian beam does not carry orbital angular momentum. A comparison can 

show when the use of a doughnut beam trap should be preferred. 

3.1 

Transfer of orbital angular momentum 

A Gaussian laser beam  does not carry orbital angular momentum as the wavefronts 

are  spherical  rather  than  helical.  As  a  result,  a  Gaussian  beam  can  only  transport  angular 

momentum  through  circular  polarization.  If  the  application  of  a  large  torque  to  a  trapped 

particle  is  desired,  a  doughnut  beam  would  usually  be  employed.  If  a  torque  relatively 

 

 

 

 

 

Heckenberg et al. Mechanical effects of optical vortices 

18 

independent  of  the  position  within  the  trap  is  wanted,  a  Gaussian  beam  should  be  used 

instead, as the torque depends on the intensity and polarization state only. 

3.2 

Difference in axial force and heating 

Heating  and  axial  forces  are  usually  unwanted  effects  in  optical  traps,  but  can  be 

quite  large  when  absorbing  particles  are  being  trapped.  Trapping  in  Laguerre-Gaussian 

beams  allows  these  effects  to  be  minimized,  as  the  particle  can  be  trapped  in  the  dark 

central region of the beam. Particles will not always be on the beam axis, such as when they 

are moving into or out of the trap, and sufficiently large particles cannot be contained within 

the  central  low-intensity  region,  so  the  maximum forces experienced by particles as they 

move within the trap are of interest. The efficiency of an optical trap can be characterized by 

the  ratio  of  the  radial  trapping  force  to  the  (unwanted)  axial  force.  As  the  axial  force  is 

proportional  to  the  absorbed  power,  the  same  efficiency  can  also  be  used  to  compare 

heating of particles within the trap. Figure 6 shows the ratio of the maximum radial trapping 

force to the unwanted maximum axial force for both  TEM00 and LG03 beams under typical 

conditions. 

 

 

 

 

Heckenberg et al. Mechanical effects of optical vortices 

19 

 

Figure 6.   Trapping efficiency for absorbing particles. The efficiency of an absorbing particle 
optical  trap  can  be  measured  by  the  ratio  of  the  maximum  radial  trapping  force  to  the 
(unwanted) maximum axial force. The beams are a  TEM00 Gaussian beam (dashed line) and 
an LG03 doughnut beam (full line). Boths beams have a wavelength of 632.8 nm, and a waist 
width of 1  mm. The particles are trapped in water 5  mm before the beam waist. Traps using 
doughnut  laser  beams  are  generally  more  efficient,  as  the  central region in a Gaussian beam 
provides a major part of the unwanted axial force, and only a minor contribution to the radial 
trapping. If a particle is sufficiently small, it can be contained entirely within the central dark 
region of the doughnut beam, and  will experience very low axial forces, and a correspondingly 
higher efficiency will result. 
 

 

The improvement obtained by using an LG beam is quite large. Axial forces will be 

much  smaller,  especially  for  small  particles,  and  heating  will  be  much  less.  Despite this, 

Gaussian  beams  are  usually  used  in  optical  traps,  as  most  optical  traps  are  used  to  trap 

transparent  particles  where  absorption  effects  are  much  smaller.  Gaussian  beams  are  also 

easier to produce and give higher intensity as losses in conversion to a doughnut beam are 

avoided, and the beam structure allows the power to be focussed into a smaller area. 

Heckenberg et al. Mechanical effects of optical vortices 

20 

 

Figure 7.   Heating of trapped transparent particles in Gaussian and doughnut beams. As rays 
incident on a transparent particle at large angles of convergence (a) are responsible for most 
of the trapping forces acting on the particle, removing the central rays (b) has relatively little 
effect  on  these  forces.  In  a  Gaussian  beam,  this  central  portion  of  the  beam  is  the  most 
intense, and is responsible for most of the heating and scattering forces acting on the particle. 
A  Laguerre-Gaussian  doughnut  beam,  however,  has  a  very  low  intensity  in  the  centre,  with 
corresponding smaller scattering forces and heating. The axial trapping forces (and the axial 
spring  constant)  are  greater  for  the  doughnut  beam  trap  as  well,  as  a  trapped  particle 
encounters a large intensity gradient as it moves upwards or downwards into the low intensity 
region (c). 
 

4.  Multiple beam optical traps 

 

 

Many  applications  of  optical  trapping  use  multiple  laser  beams.  Although  it  is 

possible to trap transparent particles with a single beam, improved trapping can be obtained 

through  using  multiple  beams,  for  example  by  using  two  counter-propagating  beams  to 

reduce  total  absorption  forces  while  increasing  gradient  forces.  Trapping  can  also  be 

achieved without strongly convergent beams, as the intersection of two beams provides an 

intensity  maximum  to  which  high  refractive  index  particles  will  be  attracted.  A  single  laser 

beam  can  trap  absorbing particles only in two dimensions, but multiple beam traps suggest 

the possibility of trapping absorbing particles three-dimensionally. 

 

A  large  number  of  different  beam  configurations  can  be  used;  a  few  basic 

configurations will be examined here to illustrate some simple effects that can be obtained by 

using  multiple  beams,  with  emphasis  on  the  effects  on  absorbing  particles  (transparent 

particles exhibit relatively simple behaviour, high refractive index particles being attracted to 

the  high-intensity  regions  of  the  beam).  We  can  also  note  that  while  a  trap  using  multiple 

mutually coherent beams is, properly speaking, a multiple beam trap, it can also be regarded 

Heckenberg et al. Mechanical effects of optical vortices 

21 

as a single beam trap with a spatially complicated beam structure. Only the simpler case of 

incoherent beams will be dealt with here. 

 

Most  laser  particle  traps  use  a  microscope  to  focus  the  beam  onto  a  sample 

contained on a microscope slide on the stage. This imposes restrictions on the usable beam 

configurations, as beams can only be introduced from above and below the slide, ruling out 

traps  using  orthogonal  beams  and  similar  arrangements.  An  optical  trap  of  different 

construction, possibly using optical fibres, can allow a greater variety of configurations. A 

few  simple  multiple  beam  traps are considered below. More complex multiple beam traps 

have been considered elsewhere[34]. We have not been able to identify any multiple beam 

configurations  able  to  provide  simple,  effective,  three  dimensional  trapping  using  a 

conventional microscope optical trap. 

4.1 

Confocal coaxial counter-propagating identical beams  

One  of  the  simplest  cases  is  where  two  beams  propagate  in  opposite  directions 

along the same beam axis and share focal planes. If the beams are of the same width, power 

and wavelength, the radial and axial momenta carried by the beams will cancel, giving zero 

radial and axial absorption forces at all positions within the beam. This allows small gradient 

forces  to  be  used  to  trap  absorbing  particles.  (Polarization  forces  have  been  used  to trap 

non-transparent particles in single beams[28].) The angular momenta of the two beams can 

either add or cancel, depending on the direction. 

4.2 

Coaxial counter-propagating beams 

If the two coaxial beams do not share focal planes, absorption forces can be used to 

radially  trap  particles  between  the  two  focal  planes  if  both  beams  are  converging  along  a 

portion of the beam axis. The Poynting vector for such a configuration is shown in figure 8. 

The  axial  force  acting  on  a  small  particle  in  the  centre  of  the  trap  will  be  zero,  but  the 

equilibrium point is unstable axially. This configuration, however, does allow relatively strong 

radial trapping with minimal axial forces.

22 

Figure  8.      Forces  in  counter-propagating  coaxial  doughnut  trap.  Identical  doughnut laser 
beams propagating in opposite directions produce a trap with an equilibrium point in the centre. 
The equilibrium is axially unstable, so true three-dimensional trapping is not achieved. A very 
low axial force is present near the centre of the trap. The length of the arrows on the diagram 
are proportional to the magnitude of the force. The beams are both 632.8 nm LG03 beams with 
waist widths of 1 mm, with the focal planes 2 mm apart. 
 

 

5.  Orbital Motion 

If a particle illuminated by a Laguerre-Gaussian laser beam absorbs any momentum 

from the beam, it will also gain angular momentum about the beam axis through absorption 

of  the  orbital  angular  momentum  of  the  beam.  A  particle  trapped  on  the  beam  axis  (the 

location of the phase singularity) will spin. If the particle is off the beam axis, orbital motion 

about the beam axis will result. This orbital motion will not be directly affected by the angular 

momentum carried by any circular polarization of the beam. 

Of  interest  is  under  what  conditions  a  particle undergoing such orbital motion will 

move into the centre of the trap, escape, or remain in a stable orbit. 

5.1 

Escape through orbital motion 

 

 

 

 

 

Heckenberg et al. Mechanical effects of optical vortices 

23 

Obviously, an orbiting particle (other than an atom, which comprises a special case 

considered below) in a  vacuum will not remain trapped as its tangential speed will continue 

to  increase.  The  cases  of  interest  involve  particles  moving  in  a  viscous  medium.  The 

Reynolds numbers expected in typical optical traps are very small (Re << 1· 10-5), so the 

motion  will  be dominated by viscous forces, flow will be laminar, and the particle velocity 

will be close to the terminal velocity within the fluid. 

For  low  Reynolds  number  motion,  the  drag  force  acting  on  a  particle  can  be 

expressed simply. For a sphere of radius a moving uniformly with a velocity u through a fluid 

of viscosity h, the drag force is given by Stokes Law 

D

= - 6pha . 

u

(21) 

For  other  shapes,  similar  results  with  slightly  different  numerical  coefficients  will 

apply. The dependence of the drag force on shape is small, and the drag force acting on a 

sphere  (equation  21)  will  be  assumed  in  all  cases.  The  dependence  on  surface  texture  is 

negligible. It should be noted that the drag force can be affected by a nearby surface[35]. 

A  spherical  particle of radius  a and mass  m experiencing an external  force  F will 

have a terminal velocity given by 

&x F=

6pha . 

In the case here, the force  F is the optical force acting on the particle. The optical 

force is a function of position within the trap and is independent of time and particle velocity, 

so the resultant equation of motion for the particle is

Since we are primarily interested in whether or not the particle will escape, move in 

a  stable  orbit,  or  be  forced  into  the  centre  of  the  trap  (i.e.  onto  the  beam  axis),  we  can 

usefully express this in cylindrical coordinates

In particular, if  &r = 0 , the particle will be in a closed orbit, if  &r < 0 , the particle will move 

towards the beam axis, and if  &r > 0 , the particle will move outwards. Thus, it is sufficient to 

consider the sign of the expression

Figure  9.  A  particle  moving  into  an  optical  vortex  trap.  This  numerical  simulation  shows  a 
particle  moving  into  the  centre  of  an  optical  trap  under  the  conditions  described  above.  The 
particle begins at rest 5  mm from the centre of the trap. The particle moves inwards without 
orbiting until it reaches the bright ring of the doughnut beam, at which time it begins to orbit the 
centre of the trap, spiralling inwards. The simulation is carried out until the particle is within a 
particle radius from the centre of the trap and the assumptions made cease to be valid. 
 

5.3  Orbital motion of small transparent particles 

 

 

 

 

Small transparent particles will be trapped in the high intensity portion of the beam 

(see figure 1) rather than on the beam axis. If the particles are slightly absorbing, they will 

move  in  orbits  staying  within  the  intense  portion  of  the  beam  (strongly absorbing particles 

will not be trapped). Unless the fluid within the trap has a very low viscosity, the speeds will 

not become high enough to cause the particle to escape.

For a typical case, such as a sphere trapped in water (P = 10· 10-3 W, l = 3, h = 

10-3 Nsm-2, c = 2.25· 108 ms-1, k =1.32· 107 m-1, w0 =0.5· 10-6 m, a = 0.1· 10-6 m and l = 
7.5· 104  m-1), this gives  u = 1.57· 10-6 ms-1 and f = 0.407 Hz.  In this case, with a viscous 

medium and the particle absorbing 1% of the incident light, the orbital speed is slow. The 

orbital  speed  is  proportional  to  the  beam  power  and  particle  size  (although  the 

approximations  employed  here  will  cease  to  be  valid  for  large  particles)  so  a  judicious 

choice of trap and particle can give observable motion. As optically trapped particles are 

typically very small, even a relatively large microscopic extinction coefficient will only result 

in  moderate  absorption.  Trapping  in a less viscous medium will give higher orbital speeds, 

and the possibility of escape will need to be considered.

Atoms  in  laser  beams  show  behaviour  similar  to  both  transparent  and  absorbing 

particles,  experiencing  gradient  and  absorption  forces.  The  behaviour  of  atoms  also  has 

some  unique  features,  such  as  the  velocity  dependence  of  forces  due  to  the  strong 

wavelength dependence of the interaction with the incident field and Doppler shifts. 

A simple semi-classical analysis shows the major features of the interaction between 

the  atom  and  the  laser  field.  A  two  level  atom,  with  upper  and  lower  level  occupation 

probabilities  Pu  and  Pl  and  resonant  frequency  w0  will  experience  two  types  of 

absorption/emission interactions with the field, namely spontaneous emission and stimulated 

emission and absorption. An average force will result from the occasions on which the atom 

absorbs  a  photon  from  the  incident  field  and  undergoes  spontaneous  emission  (since  the 

average momentum transfer due to spontaneous emission is zero). This force is given by 

 

 

F
a

= h G
k

uP

 

(40) 

where  k  is  the  wave-vector of the laser field and  G

 is the spontaneous emission rate. The 

upper state occupation  Pu depends on the detuning  D

 = (w - w0 + d), where w is the laser 

frequency and d is the Doppler shift. It also depends on the laser intensity and the line width, 

which  is  dependent  in  turn  on  the  spontaneous  emission  rate  and  the  laser  intensity.  The 

upper state occupation can be simply calculated for weak fields, where it is proportional to 

the line strength and laser intensity, and for strong fields, where  Pu = ½. An identical result 

can be obtained using a quantum mechanical approach[36]. 

Since a doughnut beam carries angular momentum of  lh per photon, there will be a 

torque about the beam axis, given by 

hG
t = l Pu

 

The electric field of the laser light will induce a polarization in the atom of  d = aE, 

where  a is the polarizability of the atom (which can be calculated quantum mechanically), 

 

 

 

giving an interaction energy of

The  polarizability  a  depends  on  the  detuning,  and  will  result  in  the  atoms  being  either 

attracted  to  or  repelled  away  from  high  intensity  regions  of  the  beam.  The  similarities 

between the effects of laser beams on transparent and absorbing particles and atoms can be 

readily  seen.  The  major  difference  is  in  the  dependence  of  forces  and  torques  on  the 

detuning and Doppler shifts. Closely related is the question of whether heating or cooling of 

trapped atoms occurs, as heating can result in atoms gaining sufficient energy to escape from 

the trap. 

We  can  also  note  that  the  interaction  of  the  atom  with  the  field is a discrete and 

probabilistic process. For a high-intensity incident field and a strongly interacting atom, it can 

be approximated as a continuous process and calculations of trajectories performed, but this 

will not be possible for weak fields or weak interactions. In these cases, sample paths can 

be  calculated  using  Monte-Carlo methods, still using the assumption that the motion of the 

atom can be treated classically. 

Apart  from  the  possibility  of  optical  trapping,  the  Doppler  shifts  experienced  by 

moving atoms can be utilized to cool an atomic gas to such low temperatures that they can 

be confined by a weak magnetic trap (MOT). 

In  view  of  the  great  success  of  optical  trapping  and  cooling  of  atoms  and  ions  in 

recent years it is interesting to speculate on what role optical vortices might play in that area. 

In a series of papers, Allen and coworkers have studied the effect on individual atoms and 

ions  of  LG  beams  containing  central  vortices.  They  showed[36,37]  that  two  level  atoms 

experienced an additional Doppler shift on account of the helical phase structure and also an 

azimuthal  force  which  applies  a  torque  about  the  beam  axis.  In  the  saturation  limit  this  is 

given by 

 

t D

l

h

.

(44) 

This  corresponds  to  transfer  of  angular  momentum  absorbed from the beam to the atom 

while the energy absorbed is reradiated away, isotropically on the average. These results are 

consistent with our 

simpler model of absorbing particles. 

They  also  showed[37]  that  if  the  atom  (or  ion)  is  trapped  in  a  potential well the 

result  can  be  a  spiralling  out  to  a  constant  orbit.  A  further  case  considered  was  an  ion

undergoing  cyclotron  motion[38]  in  a  magnetic  field  irradiated  by  counter-propagating LG 

beams.  Depending  on  the  helicity  of  the  beams,  they  predicted  that the cyclotron motion 

could be enhanced or damped away with the atom spiralling in to rest on the axis. 

 

A few reports of atom trapping experiments using LG beams have been published. 

One attraction of the use of the vortex is the possibility of using a  gradient force to trap an 

atom  on  the  axis,  in  the  dark,  where  excitation  and  heating  are  minimized.  This  could  be 

achieved by detuning the laser to the anomalous dispersion side of the spectral line so that 

the atom behaves like a particle with refractive index less than unity. Unfortunately this is the 

blue side of the spectral line, while Doppler cooling requires illumination on the red side of 

the line so that it does not seem possible to use the same beam to simultaneously cool and 

trap.  

 

A doughnut mode has been used with a magneto-optic trap by Snadden et al.[39]. 

They  used  an  intense  LG01  beam  tuned  to  the  red  to  cool  a  large  volume  of  vapour 

surrounding  a  central  MOT  using  weaker  TEM00 beams for trapping. They point out that 

high  intensity  is  needed  for  efficient  cooling  but  is  not  needed  to  trap  atoms  which  have 

already been cooled. The low intensity in the trap also results in minimal AC Stark shifts and 

broadening,  which  is  useful  if  high-precision  measurements  are  to  be  made.  In  previous 

work  they  had  used  beams  with  central  minima  produced  by  transmitting  TEM00 beams 

through glass plates with central spots, but the use of vortex beams avoids the tendency of 

the dark spot to fill by diffraction as the beam propagates. 

 

Experiments have also been reported by Schiffer et al.[40] involving the focussing of 

a  beam  of  cold  Ne  atoms  by  a  coaxial  TEM*

01  doughnut  produced  by  a  computer 

generated  hologram.  This  group  has  also  proposed  a  dipole  force  trap  based  on  vortex 

beams  which  can  be  loaded  with  precooled  atoms.  Recently,  Kuga  et  al.[41]  reported  a 

trap  for  Rubidium  atoms  based  on  a  LG03 doughnut beam, retaining the atoms for around 

1.5 s, the losses being dominated by background gas collisions. Excess heating due to the 

trapping beam is prevented by the use of pulsed polarisation gradient cooling. 

 

Yin  et  al.[42]  have  also  shown  that  a  doughnut  beam  can  be  used  to  guide  cold 

atoms  from  a  MOT.  With  a  very  weak  repumping  beam,  the  doughnut  beam  can  be 

converted  into  a  gravito-optical  trap  (GOT),  in  which  Sisyphus  cooling  and  geometrical 

cooling can reduce the temperature to about 1 mK.

Conclusion 

Optical vortices exert mechanical forces which can be easily detected and which can 

even be useful in the context of trapping microscopic particles and atoms. Doughnut beams 

can  be  used  for  trapping  high  refractive  index  particles  with  higher  efficiency  and  less 

heating, and can be used to trap low refractive index particles and bubbles. 

When absorbing particles are trapped in a doughnut beam ,which is easier than in a 

Gaussian beam, angular momentum is transferred giving rise to rotation and perhaps some 

orbital motion. Doughnut beams are also finding increasing use in atom and ion traps.

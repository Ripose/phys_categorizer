Abstract
In damping the wakefield generated by an electron beam
traversing  several thousand X-band linacs in the NLC we
utilise a Gaussian frequency distribution of dipole modes
to 
interfere,
supplemented  with  moderate  damping  achieved  by
coupling these modes to four attached manifolds. Most of
these  modes  are  adequately  damped  by  the  manifolds.
However,  the  modes  towards  the  high  frequency  end  of
the lower dipole band are not adequately damped because
the  last  few  cells  are,  due  to  mechanical  fabrication
requirements,  not  coupled  to  the  manifolds.  To  mitigate
this  problem  in  the  present  RDDS1  design,  the  output
coupler for the accelerating mode has been designed so as
to  also  couple  out  those  dipole  modes  which  reach  the
output  coupler  cell.  In  order  to  couple  out  both  dipole
mode polarizations, the output coupler has four ports. We
also report on the results of a study of the benefits which
can be achieved by supplementing manifold damping with
local  damping  for  a  limited  number  of  cells  at  the
downstream end of the structure.

1. INTRODUCTION

The transverse wakefield in an accelerator structure is due
to  dipole  modes  which  are  excited  in  the  structure  when
the beam traverses it off center. In the manifold damped
detuned  structures  [1]  two  measures  are  taken  which
mitigate  the  deflecting  effect  of  these  modes  on  trailing
bunches.  The  primary  measure  taken  is  to  modify  the
individual cells so as to achieve a smooth (currently a kick
factor weighted truncated Gaussian) distribution of mode
frequencies  which  via  destructive  interference  between
the modes leads to a large decrease in deflecting forces on
bunches arriving some 1.4 to 7 nanoseconds later. Due to
the  discreteness  of  the  modes  this  effect  begins  to  break
down  at  subsequent  time  delays,  earliest  for  the  most
widely spaced modes, latest for the most narrowly spaced
(ie where the mode density in frequency is highest). This
latter point, typically  a  maximum,  is  often  referred  to  as
the  recoherance  peak  because  it  occurs  where  the  most
closely  spaced  modes  are  again  in  phase  (~100  ns).  The
damping manifolds, four tapered circular waveguides with
electric field coupling to all cells except a few at the ends,
which serve to drain amplitude from these modes with a
time constant ~20 ns thereby limiting the magnitude of the

recoherance  effect  and  ultimately  leading  to  a  steady
reduction  in  wake  amplitude.  This  paper  is  devoted  to  a
discussion  of  two  aspects  of  this  scenario  which  have
limited the effectiveness of this approach.  As mentioned
above  a  few  cells  at  the  ends  are  not  coupled  to  the
manifolds.  This  has  been  done  to  avoid  mechanical
interference  problems.    The  consequence  has  been  that
one  to  a  few  modes  at  the  high  frequency  end  and  with
significant  kick  factors  are  very  poorly  damped.  They
show up as sharp peaks in the high frequency end of the
spectral  function  and  elevate  the  wake  amplitude.  This
effect has been more prominant in the RDDS design than
in  the  earlier  DDS  designs  due  to  the  increase  in  the
detuning  frequency  span  (11.25%)  and  in  the  ratio  of
frequency span to Gaussian width (4.75).  Nevertheless it
was  manifold  radiation  observed  in  the  DDS3  ASSET
experiment which suggested a cure. Sharp high frequency
peaks  were  observed  in  the  manifold  radiation  when  the
beam  was  displaced  vertically  but  not  when  it  was
displaced  horizontally  suggesting  that  these  modes  were
being  damped  by  the  output  coupler  for  the  accelerating
mode  which  then  had  two  horizontal  waveguide  ports.
This  led  to  the  design  of  a  four  port  output  coupler
intended to damp both polarizations of the dipole modes.
The design of the coupler, the equivalent circuit analysis
of  its  effect  and  confirmation  by  simulation,  by  RF
measurements,  and  by  observation  of  beam  induced
radiation  from  the  output  coupler  will  be  discussed  in
following section.  The other aspect has to do with the rise
in the wake amplitude which occurs  at  the  earliest  times
and is due to the early onset of recoherance for the most
widely  spaced  modes.  The  effect  of  manifold  damping
does  not  set  in  soon  enough  to  mitigate  this  effect.  This
led to an investigation of the effect of locally damping a
limited  number  of  cells  at  the  downstream  end  of  the
structure.  The  results  of  this  study  will  follow  the
discussion of the four port output coupler

2. THE FOUR PORT OUTPUT COUPLER

(1) Design

The  standard  output  coupler  for  the  DDS  structures  has
been  fitted  with  a  pair  of  WR90  rectangular  output
waveguides  polarized  in  the  electric  field  direction
emerging  on  opposite  sides  of  the  coupler  cell  in  the

horizontal direction. In order to provide an output for both
dipole  mode  polarizations  these  output  waveguides  have
been replaced by four WR62 waveguides oriented so as to
form  an  "X"  with  respect  to  the  horizontal  and  vertical
axes  [1].  The  reduced  width  was  chosen  to  conveniently
fit  the  space  limitations  dictated  by  the  output  cell
dimensions,  and  the  orientation  was  chosen  to  avoid
mechanical  interference  with  the  manifold  couplers,
which  are  located  in  the  vertical  and  horizontal  planes.
The accelerating mode and the lower dipole modes, while
the  TE01  polarisation  is  cut-off  for  both  of  them.  The
coupler was matched for the accelerator mode by varying
the cell radius and wavguide iris width as described in [2]
using the mesh shown in Fig. (1).

Outgoing ports

the 

expected of course only for those modes which reach the
output  cell,  and  all  of  the  Q’s  are  expected  to  be  much
higher  than  the  36  referenced  above.  The  most  direct
equivalent circuit information was obtained by computing
the  dipole  mode  S11  as  seen  from  the  output  coupler,
parameterised  by  making  use  of 
simulation
determined Qext (Fig. (2)).    The  Qext  of  the  broadest  peak
shown  was  of  the  order  of    300,  a  figure  which  agrees
with the result obtained from a time domain simulation of
a ten-cell model (without manifolds) terminated with the
output  coupler.  One  notes  that  the  peaks  narrow  as  one
moves to the lower frequency peaks due to an increase in
Qext.  This  effect  combined  with  the  onset  of  manifold
damping  leads  to  the  total  disappearance  of  resonance
effects  below  16  GHz.    The  spectral  function  was
recomputed with an appropriate series resistance inserted
in  the  TM  circuit  of  the  last  cell  [4].  The  sharp  peaks
which had been observed previously

(2) Assessment of the damping effect

  The first step in the assessment was the determination of
the loading effect on the output cell. A symmetry reduced
section  of  the  output  cell  with  dipole  p
  mode  boundary
conditions was probe driven in a broad band time domain
simulation  with  outgoing  wave  boundary  conditions  on
the  output  waveguides

was  also  applied  for  corroboration,  and  a  Qext  of  36
established. This information was used in a number of

   III) The Effect of Damping a Limited Number
of Cells
The spectral function plotted in Fig. (4) shows a number
of  peaks  on  the  downward  sloping  high  frequency  end
which  are  more  widely  spaced  and  somewhat  stronger
than those found at the lower frequencies. As noted above,
because  of  their  wide  spacing  their  contribution  to
deconstructive interference disappears at quite early times
and  is  responsible  for  the  sharp  rise  in  the  wake  which
follows the first minimum. This observation suggested an
exploration  of  the  effect  of  adding  moderate  local
damping to a limited number of cells towards  the  output
end  of  the  structure.  The  investigation  has  so  far  been
completely  phenomenological,  that  is,  based  on  an
assumed  distribution  of  Q  values  rather  than  a  design  of
the damped cells. We have explored tapered distributions
of Q’s confined to the cells with cell numbers above 187
and  values  no  less  than  500.  The  best  results  were
obtained with distributions which smoothed out the peaks
while  leaving  the  mean  value  of  the  spectral  function
more  or  less  intact.  Figure  (7)  shows  a  spectral  function
resulting from a linear taper of 1/Q from 1/6500 at cell

187 to 1/500 at cell 197 and thence constant. The ripples
are  indeed  smoothed  out  and  the  Gaussian  like  form  is
intact. A strong suppression of the early rise in the wake
may  be  noted  Fir.  (8).  These  results  suggest  that  this
approach warrants further investigation.

4. CONCLUSIONS

We conclude that the four port output coupler undoes the
harmful effects of decoupling the last few cells from the
damping manifolds.  Alternatively this might be done by
locally  damping  a  limited  number  of  cells  at  the  output
end of the structure with additional benefits, especially in
the early time portion of the wake.

Introduction:   Discoveries  of  extrasolar  planets
and their unusual properties have spurred renewed in-
terest in protoplanetary dynamics and the formation of
planets.  Of  particular  importance  is  the  study  of  the
mutual interactions between circumstellar disks of gas
and/or solid planetesimals and the protoplanets that are
created  by  them,  particularly  if  they  form  at  an  early
stage  in  the  protoplanetary  system’s  evolution.  With
the discovery of so many extrasolar planets orbiting at
small  distances  from  their  parent  stars,  a  number  of
mechanisms have been proposed for orbital migration
of protoplanets, since no one current model is able to
explain how giant planets can be created at these posi-
tions  within  the  protoplanetary  system  [1].  Some  of
them involve protoplanets creating gaps in the proto-
planetary  disk  [2],  limiting  the  accretion  that  allows
them to become gas giants while locking them into the
migration of the surrounding protoplanetary disk. Oth-
ers  involve  dynamical  friction  with  gas,  dust  or
planetesimals  in  the  vicinity  of  the  protoplanet  [3]
which can affect the motion of protoplanets by dissi-
pating their kinetic energy and causing inward migra-
tion. This is particularly true in systems with more than
one planet, where mean motion resonances could also
play a role [3].

A  number  of  simulations of  both  types  have  been
conducted employing gaseous protoplanetary disks [4]
having a wide range of protoplanet-to-disk mass ratios,
showing that interactions between the two can result in
significant protoplanetary eccentricities. These eccen-
tricities can also be seen in the planetesimals within the
disk as a result of the protoplanet’s perturbations, par-
ticularly  in  the  vicinities  of  mean  motion  resonances
[5].

Simulation  Model  and  Methods:   These simula-
tions model a ring of planetesimals orbiting a protostar
with a protoplanet at the ring’s inner edge. The initial
positions of the planetesimals are randomly distributed
in an annulus between 15 and 25 AU. The distribution
of masses of the planetesimals is given in Table 1. The
total  mass  of  the  planetesimal  annulus  was  kept  con-
stant at 100 Earth masses, which is also the mass of the
protoplanet situated along the inner edge located at 15
AU.  The  protoplanet  and  all  planetesimals  were  ini-
tially placed in circular, coplanar orbits with their ini-
tial eccentricities and inclinations set to zero. The nu-
merical  model  used  a  fifth-order  Runge-Kutta  algo-
rithm to calculate the trajectories of the planetesimals
over a period of five thousand years. The evolution of

the  system  was  assumed  to  have  progressed  to  the
stage where almost all the protoplanetary disk’s mass
is co ncentrated into solid objects and the gaseous com-
ponent  of  the  disk  has  either  been  accreted  or  dissi-
pated. Therefore, the simulation only considers mutual
gravitational forces, ignoring such effects as gas drag.
The planetesimals have densities which correspond to
porous rock (2.0 g/cm3). The time evolution of the or-
bital  elements  for  the  protoplanet  and  selected  larger
planetesimals  as  well  as  the  final  state  of  the  entire
ensemble is analyzed at the end of each simulation.

Simulation  Results:   Figure  1  shows  the  eccen-
tricity distribution for both sizes of planetesimals at the
end of Simulation 1. It shows that the shift in the value
for the most probable eccentricity happens early in the
system’s  evolution,  taking  place  before  the  halfway
point  (2500  years).  Both  sizes  of  planetesimals  have
similar  distributions,  with  most  planetesimals  having
eccentricities between 0.01 and 0.1.

EQUAL-MASS INTERACTIONS:  B. D. Lindsay et al.

Figure 2 displays the final planetesimal distribution
for  Simulation  1.  As  can  be  seen,  it  is  possible  for
planetesimals  to  be  scattered  into  close  orbits  around
the  central  star  (within  2  AU).  Typically,  smaller
planetesimals  are  scattered  across  the  gap  appearing
between 2 and 8 AU with the larger bodies staying at
distances  larger  than  12  AU.  The  system  also  shows
the beginnings of a scattered disk population between
28 and 32 AU, with planetesimals of both sizes popu-
lating this region. Simulations 2 and 3 revealed similar
features during their evolution.

  It  is  also  remarkable  that  planetesimals  scattered
into  close  orbits  around  the  protostar  (within  2  AU)
have  slightly  lower  eccentricities  than  those  in  orbits
just  across  the  gap  within  the  interior  of  the  original
ring.  This  suggests  such  planetesimals  may  have  un-
dergone  more  than  one  close  encounter  in  order  to
achieve these orbits. This theory is strengthened by the
fact that some of the planetesimals scattered into orbits
between  8  and  13  AU  can  have  sufficiently  high  ec-
centricities  to  approach  to  within  2  AU  of  the  proto-
star,  and  are  therefore  capable  of  interactions  with
other bodies in this region.

Figure 2. Size-Dependent Planetesimal Distribution

for Simulation 1.

Figure  3  shows  the  average  eccentricities  for  the
planetesimals in Simulation 1. Within the original ring
limits (15 to 25 AU), the eccentricity is quite low, sel-
dom  exceeding  0.1.  Planetesimals  scattered  outside
these limits have much higher values, suggesting they
can  only  reach  these  regions  through  violent  gravita-
tional scattering. This is particularly notable between 8
and  13  AU,  where  the  eccentricities  of  planetesimals
can approach one.

Eccentricity

Figure 4. Eccentricity Distribution for Simulation 4.

In Figure 4, the eccentricity distribution for Simu-
lation 4 shows that the planetesimals appear to be more
sensitive to mutual perturbations when their masses are
comparable.  Compared  to  Figure  1,  the  distribution
shows a continued evolution during the second half of
the  simulation,  with  the  peak  flattening  and  shifting
closer to 0.2. It can also be seen that more planetesi-
mals  are  scattered  into  eccentric  orbits.  This  also  oc-
curred  in  Simulation  3,  although  the  change  was  less
notable than in Simulation 4.

Conclusion: These results imply that planetesimal
systems with unevenly distributed masses may actually
be more stable than those where all the bodies are of
roughly equal size. Thus, large planetesimals resulting
from a runaway accretion phase may act as a deterrent
to planetesimal disks having a large overall orbital ec-
centricity.

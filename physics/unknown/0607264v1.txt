Abstract  
 
A model on the effects of leader, media, viruses, and worms and other agents on the opinion 
of individuals is developed and utilized to simulate the formation of consensus in society and 
price in market via excess between supply and demand. Effects of some time varying drives, 
(harmonic and hyperbolic) are also investigated. 
 
Key words: OPINION; LEADER; MEDIA; MARKET; EXCESS 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Within  the  existing  literature  about  formation  of  consensus  in  a  society  in  terms  of  opinion 
dynamics, several models and approaches were developed and utilized. Recently, we applied 
opinion  dynamics  to  econophysics.  (See,  [1]  for  Sznajd  model;  [2]  for  a  review;  [3-6]  for 
voters model; [7] for our application to market.) In the present literature focuse will be on the 
effects  of  leaders  and  media,  where  some  more  complicated  agents,  such  as  viruses  and 
worms  are  also  considered.  Model  is  displayed  in  the  following  section.  Applications  are 
performed in the next one. Last section is devoted to conclusion. 
 
 
 
2. Model 
 
We site 10,000 people in one-dimensional matrix as our society, where any individual (I) is 
characterized  by  real  numbers;  two  of  which  are  her  psychological  mood  a(I),  and  bond 
strength b(I, J) with the member (J). The opinion action on (surrounding opinion about, or the 
information  gathered  by)  her  is  A(I);  so,  resulting  opinion  of  her,  i.e.,  her  reaction  will  be 
O(I)=a(I)A(I). 
   The individuality term (a(I)) involves mainly the openness of a  member  to  be  effected  by 
opinions of else. O(I) will be negative for a positive A(I) (and vice versa), if she is antithetical 
(of opposite, reverse character), i.e., a(I) < 0. The connection b(I, J), may change from duals 
of person (door neighbors, friends, relatives, etc.) to other ones, and distribution may depend 
on the quality of society. 

   Leaders are some inhabitants of the society, and they have fixed opinion (influence strength, 
(Oleader)). They are not effected by opinions of other members of the society; but, they effect 
them through personal interactions. Media is naturally not inhabitant of our one-dimensional 
society matrix, yet she broadcasts to the society a fixed opinion (influence strength of media), 
which is added to opinion (O(I)) of each individual at the end of an interaction tour. Therefore 
media effect an individual’s opinion in two ways; directly (in terms of addition of the opinion 
broadcasted by them to the individual’s resulting opinion O(I)), and via the interactions with 
members who are already effected by media.  
 
 
 
Individuality and connections 
 
   In civilized societies b is expected to be small (weak connection) and almost uniform when 
compared  with  devoloping  ones.  In  a  scientific  society  many  colleagues  may  effect  the 
opinion of the individual under consideration; number of contacts per person will be big, and 
b is expected to be close to unity and almost uniform. In a market society, number of bonds 
per person will be few. Because, people do not talk extensively on their financial matters in 
general they consider their financial issues as private and secret. Yet, they share their financial 
privacies with some officials (dealers, brokers, etc.) and with some friends an relatives. So, b 
may be dispersed between zero and unity. Within a scientific society there may not exist any 
antithetical  member,  but  in  exchanges  there  exist  many,  especially  within  dealers  and 
medium-big portfolio players. Two other reasons, besides many possible ones to support the 
present approach about the contribution of antithetical people may be underlined as: Anybody 
in any society may react oppositely from time to time. And, in a market the whole amount of 
sellings are bought by antithetical people during recession (and, vice versa). 
   We may assign four citizens (I-2, I-1, I+1, I+2) to be the most strongly bounded ones to any 
member (I), with bondstrength of unity. And, another four (I-4, I-3, I+3, I+4)to be relatively 
weakly  bounded  with  a  bondstrength  of  half  a  unity.  We  then  compute  the  opinion  formed 
around any individual (which we call the action, A(I)) as a weighted average of the opinion of 
the connected people over bonds with the pronounced bondstregths. So, A(I) = (∑O(α)*1.0)/4 
+ (∑O(β)*0.5)/4, where the summations are performed over some α, and β which designates 
the  primary  (i.e.  those  with  a  bondstrength  of  unity)  and  secondary  (i.e.  those  with  a 
bondstrength  of  half  a  unity)  strong  connections  of  (I),  respectively.  Other  connections  are 
ignored. 
 
 
 
Initial distributions of opinions 
 
   Several  initial  distributions  may  be  performed  to  satisfy  the  needs  of  any  given  stituation 
[8]. In Figure 1. we exemplify a case, where initial opinions of arbitrarily chosen 961 people 
(out of 10,000 citizens) are randomly distributed between -1 and 1. An interesting feature is 
that,  the  envelope  for  the  opinions  decrease  exponentially  with  number  of  interaction  tours, 
(which may be taken as time (t)), i.e., O(I) ∝ exp(σt), with σ<0. 
 
 
 
 
 

 
Memory effect 
 
   The action A(I) involves the effect of interacting people. A random distribution is utilized 
for  the  individuality  term  (a(I)),  and  the  multiplication  term  a(I)A(I)  may  be  taken  as  the 
resulting opinion formed at a given time. Yet, any citizen of the society may have a memory 
(non zero intelligence, self-confidence) as another characteristic feature besides these of her 
involved  within  a(I).  We  incorporate  the  effect  of  individual’s  memory,  i.e.  her  previous 
opinion  by  incorporating  it  in  the  formation  of  the  resulting  opinion:  O(I)new  =  O(I)previous  + 
a(I)A(I). In this case, envelopes of the opinions increase exponentially with time (t), i.e., O(I) 
∝ exp(σt), with 0<σ. (See, Figure 2.) In fact, memory effect may differ from person to person 
within  any  society,  and  the  term  O(I)previous  within  the  previous  summation  should  be 
multiplied  by  the  pronounced  distribution  function.  In  our  computations  we  multiply 
O(I)previous  by  either  zero  for  no  memory  (zero  intelligence)  case,  or  unity  for  full  memory 
(non zero intelligence, selfconfidence) case. 
 
 
 
Constraints on opinions    
 
   In  reality,  opinions  do  not  grow  without  limits.  Mostly  they  turn  into  decissions,  such  as 
accepting  an  idea  or  rejecting  it,  voting  for  a  candidate  (person  or  a  party)  or  not  voting, 
buying in a market or not buying, selling in a market or not selling, etc. We may designate the 
positive (negative) decission by an opinion having the value +1 (-1), and stop the growths of 
opinions beyond it (them). Furthermore, we may apply threshold for decissions, as in Figures 
3 a. and b., and Figures 4 a. and b., where the thresholds are ±0.999, and ±0.8, respectively. If 
an opinion is greater than the positive (less than the negative) threshold, we take it as (minus) 
unity.  As  thresholds  decrease  in  absolute  value,  evolution  saturates  more  quickly,  since 
decissions are made more easily, opinions accumulate at -1 and +1 terminals more quickly. 
   It is worth to note that, within the further computations we reset parameters to their initial 
values at the end of each 100 tours, i.e. what is usually called iterations in literature (each site 
treated once in each tour). We call the time domain between each reset, a day. And five days 
make our week. Initial opinions will be randomly distributed between -1, and +1 (as in Fig. 3. 
a. and Fig. 4. a.; at t=0,  and  at  t=100). Please notify  that,  in  our  market  applications  all  the 
members  with  opinions  0.999  <  O(I),  i.e.  the  acceptors  with  opinion  equals  to  +1,  will  be 
considered  as  demanders  (buyers),  and  these  with  opinions  O(I)<-0.999,  i.e.,  rejectors  with 
opinion equals to -1, will be considered as suppliers (sellers). Excess will be computed as the 
difference between demand and supply, explicitly; excess = demand – supply. 
   Now we may consider some complicated agents as leaders and mass media. 
 
 
 
Leaders and media 

   What we meant by a leader was an inhabitant of the society who has a fixed opinion, i.e., 
influence strength (Oleader). We run the the leader effect with various influence strengths from 
zero  to  unity  and  we  vary  the  number  of  leaders  as  1,  10,  100  and  1,000.  It  was  our 
previous[7] observation that, a single leader, do not contribute much to the opinion evolution 
in a crowded society with moderate influence strength and with small number of interaction 
tours.  Effect  of  single-site  leadership  fades  down,  when  the  tours  are  extended.  In  order  to 
establish a consensus within a society and to speculate on a market, one needs many leaders. 

A  short-cut  is  the  mass  media,  where  the  opinion  advertised  by  the  mass  media  (influence 
strength  of  media)  is  added  to  these  of  individuals’  formed  at  each  interaction  tour.  It  is 
known  that,  “The  larger  the  lattice  is  the  smaller  is  the  amount  of  advertising  needed  to 
conceive  the  whole  market.”[9].  We  found  that  media  with  influencial  strength  ranging 
between 0.1 and 0.15 is sufficient to create amply effects within the present society. Because,  
media influences an individual in two ways; directly (in terms of addition of media effect to 
the  individual’s  resulting  opinion  of  O(I)=a(I)A(I)),  and  via  the  interactions  with  members 
who are already effected by media. 
 
 
Viruses and worms 
 
   In some cases, like the legal social organizations as political parties (underground ones like 
mafia,  etc.)  people  may  join  to  the  leader  with  a=1,  and  b=1.  And  the  number  of  joined 
people, as repeaters of the leader message, may increase in time. More new people may join 
as the number of joined people increases. This stituation, i.e. grow in the population of joined 
people is like the spread of living cells by copying themselves. 
   On  the  other  hand,  viruses  may  infect  the  computers,  which  are  utilized  to  process  in 
market, and viruses may spread throughout the net. 
   In all these events, new agents emerge with a=1, and b=1. Please imagine that, we start with 
a  mostly  empty  chain,  and  slowly  fill  it  with  new  agents.  If  we  could  expand  the  fully 
occupied chain from length N to length N+1 one a new agent is born. Suppose that N is the 
number of joined agents at any time, and ∆N  is  the  increament  of  them  in  the  coming  time 
interval of ∆t. Then we may define the rate of change σ in N as σ = ∆N/∆t, where the unit of 
dimension for σ is (number of new agents)/(tour of opinion interactions). To be more precise, 
the dimension (tour of opinion interactions) maybe considered as (time), or (day). It is known 
that,  σ is proportional to N at a given time for biological viruses, and (after some calculus) 
we may state that N = N0 exp(δt), where δ =σ/N=constant. 
   On the other hand, σ may be (independent of N, and) constant in time, as another commonly 
met variation. Some of the corresponding stituations in reality are: Conquering countries by 
an army, spreading of a message delivered by a very convincing leader such as a prophet who 
is traveling, spreading of a news through some very selected and reliable friends, buying of a 
big  trading  company  for  her  clients  in  a  market,  and  an  internet  worm  traveling  from 
computer to computer which are connected to market on the aim of processing there, etc. 
 
 
 
3. Applications 
 
   We  apply  our  model  in  market.  The  reasons  for  the  present  test  are:  First  of  all,  market 
results  are  easy  to  check  with  reality.  They  are  more  familiar  with  respect  to  many  other 
opinion  dynamics  applications,  and  they  are  more  easily  comprehendible.  Any  il-logical 
(wrong)  approach  in  the  formalism  may  be  reflected  throughout  the  calculations  as  an 
abnormal  (contradicting)  result,  which  may  be  easily  detected.  Many  basic  and  important 
concepts  and  terms  of  the  model  becomes  concrete  (solid)  in  market  jargon.  For  example, 
“acceptors  (rejectors)  of  an  idea”  becomes  “buyers  (sellers)”,    etc.  We  may  neatly  see  the 
effect  of  changing  opinions  in  market,  since  we  may  count  the  number  of  buyers,  sellers, 
waiters, and their total effect on price, which is an easily observable and measurable quantity. 
And finally, beyond all these, market is (by itself) a society, where opinion dynamics is the 

basic mechanism for processes. Moreover, we have many real markets in our life, with which 
we may compare various results of our simulations. 
 
Initial distribution of opinions 
 
   Throughout the present work, we apply a random initial distribution between -1 and +1, and 
utilize threshold values of –0.999 and +0.999 to trap the rejectors of a proposed idea (sellers, 
anode side), and acceptors (buyers, cathode side), respectively. We count the accumulation of 
trapped opinions at anode and cathode sides, as displayed in Figure 5. a. and b. together with 
the corresponding excess (upmost curves in Figs. 5. b.-7. b.). 
 
 
 
Evolution of opinions in market society 
 
   What  characterizes  a  market  society  is  that,  her  members  come  together  to  gain  money. 
Some gain, while some lose. Any of them wants to know the opinion (decission, if possible) 
of  all  the  others.  Because,  the  price  is  shaped  by  the  behaviors  of  all  the  people  in  market. 
Yet,  they  may  behave  very  differently  to  the  surrounding  opinion  A(I).  Individuality  a(I) 
involves  diversity,  and  O(I)  is  expected  to  display  dispersion  in  value.  Connection  b  is  not 
much extensive. 
   The  society,  with  the  pronounced  parameters,  come  together  every  market  morning  with 
some opinions in mind, that we called (and reset to) the initial distribution of opinions of the 
market day. And accordingly, those with opinions above the trapping threshold for buyers are 
counted for demand, and those below the trapping threshold for sellers are counted for supply. 
   Within  the  absence  of  any  leadership  and mass media effects, the opinion dynamics takes 
place  and  survive  inbetween  the  members  which  are  very  similar  to  each  other.  We  have 
characteristic horizontal- (and occasional non-horizontal-) trends in excess, since randomness 
is dominant. Contribution of antithetical people averages to zero within medium- or long-run. 
And in short-run, antithetical contribution within moderate amplitudes may cause to stiff rises 
and falls, which cause up-, and down-trends in excess. They decorate the medium- or long-
range  time  charts.  And  if  the  antithetical  contribution  is  erased,  then  almost  all  the  intraday 
and interday differences fade down. 
 
 
 
Driving:  leaders, media, viruses and worms 
 
   Effects of leaders and media may be considered as driving; since they may have the ability 
of alligning the society. Furthermore, such drivings may be organized in terms of coalisions 
of  social  parties;  parallel  and  coordinated  broadcasting  of  television  channels,  newspapers, 
radio  stations  of  the  same  media  group,  of  a  boss  or  of  an  holding,  etc.  On  the  other  hand, 
antithetical contribution becomes significant under any driving effect, since these individuals 
oppose  the  authorithy  and  slow  down  her  influence  within  society.  When  the  antithetical 
contribution is erased, the society becomes (more) easily polarizable under drives. We run the 
leader effect between 0.0 and 1.0 and vary the number of leaders by 1, 10, 100, and 1000. On 
the  other  hand,  we  run  the  antithetical  percentage  from  50  to  zero.  And  we  observed  that 
leaders  effected  the  society  when  their  influence  parameter  is  near  to  1.0  (more  precisely, 
above  0.8)  and  when  they  are  crowded  (more  precisely,  when  their  number  is  above  few 
hundreds). 

   When  we  assume  that  20-50%  of  the  society  is  antithetical,  it  amounts  to  2,000-5,000 
people, and when the number of leaders become comparable with that of antithetical people 
their influence starts to be felt. For (small or) zero antithetical percentages, leader effect starts 
to be observed at weak influence strengths. Figure 6. a. plots the case, where the antithetical 
percentage is 50, and leading influence changes from 0.3 to 0.9 in steps of 0.3 for each value 
of  the  number  of  leaders  10,  100,  and  1000,  consequetively.  Figure  6.  b.  plots  the  same  as 
Fig.6. a. for an antithetical percentage of zero. It may be claimed that, in case of ideological 
(and religional, etc.) splittings in society, antithetical people may be considered as resistors to 
the  officially  publicated  idea.  And  later,  they  may  become  new  leaders  too,  with  opposing 
influence strength to the present ones. Such a society may be considered as having two sets of 
opposing leaders, or two opposing political parties, etc. We found that, organizing style is the 
crucial  parameter  rather  than  the  number  and  the  influencial  strength  of  the  leader  groups: 
Any may be greater by a few percent than the other group. Because, maximizing the number 
of  connections  necessiates  a  succesfully  made  distribution  of  driving  (leading)  cites  within 
society.  So,  in  case  of  close  values  of  numbers  and  influencial  strengths,  that  leader  group 
with  a  greater  number  of  effected  people  per  leader  wins.  This  result  is  important  during 
political elections where two strong parties exist, and percentage of undecided people is high. 
We also considered instantaneous leadership and media effects with contradiction, i.e., with 
opposing propositions. Instead of a random distribution of leaders, if they are well organized 
within  a  society,  they  may  gain  against  a  mass  effect,  where  the  two  crucial  points  are; 
maximizing the number of connections per leader and establishing stronger bonds. 
   If,  on  the  other  hand,  we  have  a  unified  group  of  leaders  and  if  the  number  of  leaders 
increases  in  time,  then  the  stituation  may  be  described  in  terms  of  viruses  and  worms  as 
mentioned in previous paragraphs. The condition is that, members of new generation has to be 
cited with bondings (to leaders) equal to unity.  
   Figure  7.  a.  displays  how  the  number  of  acceptors  and  rejectors  of  the  idea  publicated  by 
viruslike increasing leaders (with a common influence strength of Oleader =0.3) and the excess 
vary in time, for δ=0.01 (number/day). The same plot may be interpretted for the number of 
buy orders and sell orders, all booked by virus infected computers in market. Figure 7. b. is 
for a worm, which (with an influence strength of 0.1) moves (infects) with a constant spead of 
0.01  (number)/(day).  If  on  the  other  hand,  the  rate  (δ)  is  reversed,  we  have  decaying 
leadership and a dying worm. 
   It is clear that the strength of leader and media effects is a function of their influence (i.e. 
magnitude of opinions broadcasted) and that of their number. In some cases their number may 
vary,  and  in  some  other  cases  their  influence,  or  both.  So,  one  may  take  into  account  their 
number  as  well  as  their  influence,  while  studying  their  driving  effect.  In  the  following 
subsections  we  will  consider  some  drives  which  are  harmonic  and  hyperbolic,  where  the 
lateral ones can be written as some constant term equals to multiplication of the influence and 
the number. In this manner one may observe the effect of influence versus the number. 
 
 
 
Harmonic drives 
 
   A sinusoidal function is known to display a variety of properties over a period: For example 
it  is  nearly  constant  at  extrema  and  nearly  linear  at  middle  regions.  That  is  why  we  tried 
sinusoidal variation for both the number of leaders, keeping the influence magnitude constant 
and vice versa, i.e., for the influence magnitude and keeping the number of leaders constant. 
The complete period of the utilized sinusoidal function covered 8 market weeks in both cases, 
where  1  market  week  is  composed  of  5  market  days.  So,  if  Oleader  stands  for  the  influencial 

magnitude (opinion of the leaders), Oleader=0.1 sin(2π(t/8)), where t runs over market weeks, 
for  a  constant  number  of  leaders.  Here,  we  observed  that  the  excess  roughly  followed  the 
periodicity,  within  a  time  domain  of  16  weeks,  i.e.  two  full  sinusoidal  periods.  We  made  a 
similar  observation  for  sinusoidally  varying  number  of  leaders  with  constant  Oleader,  i.e., 
N=ABS(700sin(2π(t/8))),  where  ABS  stands  for  taking  the  absolute  value,  since  negative 
number of leaders does not exist. And, again t runs over (16) market weeks. Furthermore, we 
took  into  account  two  different  antithetical  percentace  of  zero  and  50,  in  both  of  the 
pronounced sinusoidal driving cases, and we observed again that, high antithetical percentace 
weakened the present driving effect. 
   Sinusoidal variations in the number and influence magnitude may exist instantaneously and 
they may have different angular speeds and phases. These issues may be subject for our future 
researches.  Effect  of  antithetical  percentage  on  the  reponse  of  the  society  against  the  drivig 
authorities may be another subject for our future researches. 
 
 
 
Hyperbolic drives 
 
   Finally,  we  considered  a  case,  where  both,  the  leaders’  influence  and  their  number  are 
varied  with  time.  We  assumed  an  hyperbolic  relation  of  the  form  C=N  Oleader,  where  C  is 
some  constant.  We  run  Oleader  as  the  independent  parameter,  which  is  increased  from  0.1  to 
1.0 in steps of 0.1 in time (16 market weeks), and C is taken as 10 and 100. We observed that, 
for a given antithetical percentage, excess decreased with increasing Oleader, and decreasing N 
for  both  of  the  pronounced  values  of  C.  Secondly,  increament  in  antithetical  percentage 
weakened  the  effect  of  drives  in  all  of  the  investigated  combinations.  It  may  be  noted  that, 
increasing  (e.g.,  doubling)  the  number  of  leaders  is  more  effective  than  increasing  (e.g., 
doubling) their influencial magnitude. 
 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
   We  do  not  certainly  aim  at  saying  that,  any  society  may  be  driven  according  to  any 
albebraic expression. Yet, the algebraically approximated tendencies may involve many clues. 
The nonlinearity within the response of the society to different algebraic forms may be result 
of  a  “social  memory”.  For  example,  it  can  be  observed  that,  antithetical  people  may  be 
playing the role of absorbers (inertia (?)) of the society, against several driving effects. 
   Many quantities, such as the connectivity and strength of bonds, as well as the percentage of 
antithetical  people  in  the  given  society,  etc.  are  needed  to  known  empirically  for  better 
utilization of the presented results, else than the assumptions made about the relevant issues.

see the relevant text and previous figures. Please  notify that, demand is ploted with respect to 
left perpendicular axis, supply is ploted with respect to right perpendicular axis. So, the axes 
are shifted with respect to each other, but units are the  same. Excess (= demand – supply) is 
also  drawn  with  respect  to  a  shifted  perpendicular  axis  (unshown),  with  the  common  unit. 
Please notice the intraday saturation of demand and supply. 
 
Figure 6.a.  Leader  effect.  Antithetical  percentage  is  50,  and  leading  influence  is  changed 
from  0.3  to  0.9  in  steps  of  0.3  for  each  value  of  the  number  of  leaders  10,  100,  and  1000, 
consequetively. Axes as in Fig.5b. 
 
Figure 6.b.  Antithetical percentage is 0, and the rest is same as in Fig.6.a. 
 
Figure 7.a.  Virus  effect,  where  the  copying  rate  (δ)  is  0.01  (number)/(day).  Axes  as  in 
Fig.5.b. 
 
Figure 7. b.  Worm effect, where moving (growing) rate (δ) is 0.01 (number)/(day). Axes as 
in Fig.5.b.

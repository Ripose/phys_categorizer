ABSTRACT

Closely packed conformations of helices formed on the ideal rope are considered. The

pitch  versus  radius  relations  which  define  a  closely  packed  helix  are  determined.  The

relations stem from the turn-to-turn distance and curvature limiting conditions. Plots of

the relations are shown to cross each other. The physical sense of the crossing point is

discussed.

1. Introduction

  The  phenomenon  of  coiling  is  observed  in  various  biological  and  physical

systems  such  as  the  tendrils  of  climbing  plants  [1],  one-dimensional  filaments  of

bacteria  [2]  or  cylindrical  stacks  of  phospholipid  membranes  interacting  with  an

amphiphilic  polymers  [3].  In  some  cases  the  phenomenon  occurs  in  conditions  in

which  the  helical  structures  created  by  coiling  become  closely  packed.  A  single,

closely packed helix is one of them. In a different context its formation was studied in

Monte-Carlo simulations by Maritan et. al. [4]. Below we present a simple analytical

arguments  leading  to  the  determination  of  the  parameters  of  the  optimal  closely

packed helix.

Take a piece of a rope of diameter D and try to arrange it into a right-handed

helix, see Fig.1, described parametrically by the set of equations:

The helix is well defined if its radius r and pitch P are specified. As easy  to

check experimentally, when the helix is formed on a real rope, not all values of r and

P  are  accessible.  Being  material,  the  rope  cannot  be  arranged  into  shapes,  which

violate  its  self-impenetrability.    If,  for  instance,  one  chooses  to  form  a  helix  with

r=2D, its pitch cannot be made smaller than about 1.003 D. This is the value at which

the consecutive turns of the helix become closely packed. For a smaller pitch overlaps

would occur. See Fig. 2.

Fig. 2  When at a given radius the pitch of the rope helix is too small overlaps appear.

r=2; P=1.003 on the left and P=0.5 on the right.

A general question arises: which are the limits for the radius and pitch values

of a helix formed with a rope of the diameter D?

The question was posed some time ago in discussions connected with the problem of

ideal knots [5]. Calculations we present here were directly stimulated by recent paper

by Maritan et al. who performed Monte Carlo simulations of the rope confined within

a box. As indicated by the authors, the pitch to radius ratio of the optimal helix they
discovered matches very well the value of the ratio found in the α-helix discovered by

nature in the evolution processes. Possible implications of their results were discussed

by Stasiak and Maddocks [6].

The  symbolic  algebra  and  numerical  techniques  we  present  below  are

analogous to those we applied considering the problem of the close packings of two

ropes twisted together [7].

2. Ideal rope

Considerations  presented  below  are  valid  for  the  so-called  ideal  ropes,  i.e.

ropes, which, from a physical point of view are completely flexible, but at the same

time perfectly hard. Assume that the axis of such a rope is shaped into a smooth curve

C.  At any point of the curve its tangent vector t is defined. The rope is ideal, if each

of  its  sections,  perpendicular  to  the  tangent  vector  t,  makes  a  circle  of  diameter  D.

None of the circles overlaps with any other of them.

  Let the ideal rope be shaped into a closely packed helix H of a radius r>D.

To understand better, what we mean by the „closely packed helix”, we may imagine

that the rope is wound as tightly as possible on a cylinder of diameter (2r-D).

Fig.3 Rope a diameter D wound as tightly as possible

on a cylinder of diameter (2r-D).

In  such  conditions  the  consecutive  turns  of  the  helix  remain  at  the  smallest

possible distance equal D. The points, at which the closely packed rope stays in touch
with itself, are located on a helix H’ of a radius r’<r (the pitch of H’ remains the same

as  that  of  H).  Now,  let  us  remove  the  inner  cylinder  and  try  to  make  r  smaller  and

smaller keeping all time the helix closely packed. As r goes down, the pitch  P goes

up.  Below  we  determine  the  relation  PCP1(r)  which  in  the  minimum  turn-to-turn

distance condition binds r and P.  Experiments prove that at a certain value of r, the

path  determined  by  the  PCP1(r)  relation  is  left  and  the  consecutive    stage  of  the
squeezing process is governed by a different limiting condition: the local curvature κ

of the helix cannot be larger than 2/D. This new condition binds P and r in a different

5

manner.  We  shall  also  find  its  shape  PCP2  (r).  At  the  point,  at  which  both  relations

cross,    the  closely  packed  helix  has  a  special,  optimal  shape  discussed  by  Maritan

et.al. [4].

3. Closely packed helix limited by its doubly critical self distance

Consider the ideal rope shaped into a helix H whose consecutive turns touch

each other. Which, for a given r, should be the pitch P of the helix, to keep its turns

closely packed? We shall answer the question.

Consecutive turns of the helix touch each other if the minimum of the distance

from any point P1 of the helix to the points located in the beginning of the next turn is

equal D. Let P2 be the point at which this minimum distance is reached. Let t1 and t2

be the vectors tangent of H at P1 and P2, respectively. Obviously, in such a situation,

the 

21PP

 vector is perpendicular both to t1 and t2. 

21PP

 belongs both to the plane Σ1

located  at  P1  and  perpendicular  to  t1  and  to  the  plane  Σ2  located  at  P2  and

perpendicular to t2. Thus,

21PP

 belongs to the line along which Σ1 and Σ2 cross. Let P1

located at (x1, y1, z1) be given; let it be the point of H defined by ξ1 = 0:

Components of the tangent vector t1 located at P1 are equal:

π2
Consequently, the Σ1 plane going through P1 and perpendicular to t1 is defined by the

relation.)  The  shapes  of  the  P(ξ)  and  r(ξ)  functions  are  shown  in  Fig.  4,  where  we

The second derivative is positive in the interval (4.49341, 2π). Replotting the PCP1(r)

relation  only  within  this  range  reveals  which  of  its  branches  presents  the  required

solution. See Fig. 7.

Fig.7 The dependence of the pitch P on the radius r found in closely packed helices. D=1.

The result we obtained stays in agreement with the intuition: a closely packed helix,

whose  radius  is  squeezed,  increases  its  pitch.  As  seen  in  the  figure,  r=0.5  seems  to

limit the squeezing process. Is it really the case?

9

4. Closely packed helix limited by its curvature

There exists another mechanism, which limits the set of possible (r,P) values

of  the  helices  formed  on  an  ideal  rope.  It  stems  from  the  fact  that  the  ideal  rope  of

diameter  D  cannot  have  a  local  curvature  larger  than  2/D.  The  following  heuristic
reasoning  indicates  the  source  of  the  limitation.  Let  h(x)  be  a  helix  of  curvature  κ

parameterised  by  arc-length  x.  Let  h’(x)  be  the  field  of  its  tangent  vectors.  Imagine

that a disk of diameter D, centred on h(x) and  perpendicular to h’(x) is swept along

the  helix.  The  circular  border  of  the  moving  disk  determines  within  the  space  the

surface  of  the  ideal  rope.  Consider  the  traces  d(x1)  and    d(x2)  of  the  disk  in  two

consecutive positions  h(x1) and h(x2) separated by an infinitesimal arc dx.  Because of

the  non-zero  curvature  of  the  helix  along  which  the  disk  was  swept  disks  d(x1)  and
d(x2) are not parallel to each other – they are inclined by angle κdx. When κ>2/D the

disks  overlap.  Consequently,  the  surface  of  the  rope  determined  by  border  of  the

swept disk becomes non-smooth. Fig.8 illustrates the situation.

Fig. 8  If the local curvature of the helix is too large the impenetrability of the

ideal  rope  is  also  violated.    For  the  helix  presented  in  the  figure  r=0.1and
P=1, thus its local curvature κ=2.83.

Let us consider analytical consequences of this inequality.

The curvature of a helix defined by equation (1) equals:

Fig. 9  presents relation (13) together with the discussed above relation (8). One can

see that their plots cross. As a result some  parts of the PCP1(r) and PCP2(r) solutions

become inaccessible.

Mutually accessible parts of the PCP1(r) and PCP2(r) solutions define within the (r,P)

plane a border line PCP(r) below which one cannot go; helices found in this forbidden

region  are  impossible  to  build  with  the  perfect  rope.  Figure  10  presents  the  border

PCP(r)  line  together  with  the  images  of  the  closely  packed  helices  located  at  a  few

representative points of it .

The  helix  seen  in  the  cusp  point  at  which  the  CP1  and  CP2  solutions  meet,  is  the

optimal helix discussed in ref.[4].

5. Physical properties of the optimal helix

Monte Carlo simulations performed by Maritan et al. were aimed to find those

shapes  of  the  rope,  for  which  the  radius  of  gyration  becomes  minimised.  Radius  of

gyration is a geometrical property of  a curve. It is defined  as the root mean square

distance of a set of points (obtained by a discretisation of the curve) from its centre of

mass. Does the optimal helix minimises some physical properties of the curve?

Let us imagine that equal masses,  m=1, are distributed along an ideal rope at

equal distances dL. The rope is then shaped into a closely packed helix. Which is the

energy  of  the  gravitational  interaction  between  the  masses?  Obviously,  the  energy

depends  on the Euclidean distance dS between them. See Fig. 11. The distance dS is

always  smaller  than  dL  and  its  value  depends  on  the  parameters  of  the  helix  into

which the rope is shaped. As shown above, values of the parameters are limited by the

turn-to-turn distance (doubly critical self distance) and the curvature of the helix.

12

Fig. 11 The relation between dL and dS.

Calculations we performed show, that for a given dL, dS reaches its minimum within

the optimal helix. See Fig. 12.

Fig. 12 dS vs. r for closely packed helices.

Consequently,  the  energy  of  gravitational  interactions  reaches  its  minimum  as  well.

One can certainly find a few other cases, in which the optimal helix of Maritan et al.

proves also to be optimal.

13

6. Discussion

We have shown that looking for closely packed helices formed with the ideal

rope  one  has  to  consider  two  cases:  helices  limited  by  the  turn-to-turn  distance  and

helices limited by the local curvature. As indicated by Maritan et al. [4], the two cases

can be brought into one: helices limited by the global curvature, a notion introduced

by  O. Gonzalez  and  J.  Maddocks  [9].  The  radius  of  the  global  curvature  at  a  given

point  P  of  a  space  curve  C  is  defined  as  the  radius  of  smallest  circle  which  goes

through the chosen point and any other two points P1, P2 belonging to C and different

from  P.  Putting  a  limit  on  the  global  curvature  of  a  helix  one  limits  both  the  local

curvature and the closest distance between its consecutive turns. As a result the union

of accessible parts of the presented above partial solutions PCP1(r) and PCP2(r) can be

seen  as  a  single  solution  PCP(r).  The  solution  shown  in  Fig.10  answers  the  problem

formulated  as  follows:  which  is  the  relation  between  the  pitch  P  and  the  radius  of

helices whose global curvature equals 2/D? Asking simpler, synthetic questions helps

finding simpler, synthetic answers.

There  exists  another,  equivalent  formulation  of  the  problem.  Instead  of  the

global curvature one can use the notion of the injectivity radius [10]. The injectivity

radius of a smooth curve K is the maximum radius of the disks which centred on each

point of K and perpendicular to its tangent remain disjoint.  In terms of the injectivity

radius the closely packed helices can be seen as the helices whose injectivity radius is

equal to the predetermined radius of the used tube.

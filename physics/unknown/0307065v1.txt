Abstract 

Learning and memory may rely on the ability of neuronal circuits to reorganize 
by  dendritic  spine  remodeling.  We  have  looked  for  geometrical  parameters  of 
cortical  circuits,  which  maximize  information  storage  capacity  associated  with 
this mechanism. In particular, we calculated optimal volume fractions of various 
neuropil components. The optimal axonal and dendritic volume fractions are not 
significantly  different  from  anatomical  measurements  in  the  mouse  and  rat 
neocortex,  and  the  rat  hippocampus.  This  has  led  us  to  propose  that  the 
maximization  of  information  storage  capacity  associated  with  dendritic  spine 
remodeling  may  have  been  an  important  driving  force  in  the  evolution  of  the 
cortex.  

 
 
Introduction 
 
Many important brain functions, such as learning and memory, depend on the plasticity 
of neuronal circuits. Traditionally, plasticity is thought to rely on the following biological 
mechanisms:  changes  in  the  strengths  of  existing  synaptic  connections,  formation  and 
elimination  of  synapses  without  remodeling  of  neuronal  arbors,  and  remodeling  of 
dendritic  and  axonal  branches.  In  order  to  understand  the  respective  roles  of  these 
mechanisms we began to evaluate their plasticity potentials, i.e. the number of available 
yet  different  circuits  attainable  by  each  mechanism.  In  particular,  we  calculated  the 
plasticity  potential  associated  with  the  reorganization  of  neuronal  circuits  by  dendritic 
spine remodeling. We expressed our results in terms of the logarithm of the number of 
available circuits, or the information storage capacity. 
 
Next,  we  looked  for  geometrical  parameters  of  the  cortical  circuits,  which  maximize 
information storage capacity associated with this mechanism. We found optimal axonal, 
and  dendritic  volume  fractions  as  functions  of  dendritic  and  axonal  length  densities, 
average  dendritic  spine  length,  and  density  of  synapses.  We  compared  these  optimal 
geometrical parameters with the anatomical data and found a reasonable agreement. 
 
 
Information storage capacity 
 
We  start  by  briefly  reviewing  the  framework  behind  the  calculation  of  the  information 
storage capacity due to the formation and elimination of synapses, which has been done 
previously1,2.  Because  the  majority  of  excitatory  synapses  are  located  on  spines3  the 
reorganization  of  neuronal  circuits  can  be  implemented  by  retracting  some  dendritic 

spines from pre-synaptic axons and extending them towards other axons. Such switching 
of pre-synaptic partners is only possible if there are a greater number of axons within a 
spine  length  of  a  dendrite  than  the  number  of  dendritic  spines  (Fig.  1).  We  refer  to 
locations  in  neuropil  where  an  axon  is  present  within  a  spine  length  of  a  dendrite  as 
potential  synapses.  Potential  synapse  is  a  necessary  but  not  sufficient  condition  of  an 
actual synaptic connection.  
 
If the number of potential synapses is equal to the number of spines (Fig. 1B), then there 
are no available pre-synaptic partners and spine remodeling cannot contribute to circuit 
reorganization. If the number of potential synapses is greater than the number of spines 
(Fig. 1C), then spine remodeling can contribute to circuit reorganization (Fig. 1D).

The  number  of  potential  synapses  is  equal  to  the  number  of  spines  and  spine

spines. D. New circuit obtained from C through spine remodeling. 

 
To determine which scenario (Fig. 1B or Fig. 1C) better reflects the real brain, we have 
derived a mathematical expression (making no assumptions about neuronal arbor shapes) 
to evaluate the ratio of numbers of actual and potential synapses. We call this ratio the 
filling fraction,  f :

synapses. This mean sine is equal to 
branches (cortex, hippocampus), and to 1 for axons and dendrites intersecting at the right 
angle (parallel fibers of granular cells and dendrites of Purkinje neurons in cerebellum). 
The filling fraction calculated according to Eq. 1 for different species and brain areas1,2 is 
in the range of 0.1-0.3. As a result, cortical micro-architecture is depicted better in Figs. 
1C,D rather than in Fig. 1B.

number of different synaptic connectivity patterns. We have shown that the information

At  first  glance,  it  might  appear  that  in  order  to  obtain  large  structural  synaptic 
information  storage  capacity,  i ,  it  is  sufficient  to  increase  the  axonal  and/or  dendritic 
,a dρ .  This  change  would  result  in  the  decrease of the filling fraction, 
length  densities, 
f  [according to Eq. (1)], and consequently, increase in the information capacity,  i , Eq. 
,a dρ  
sn . This reduction, in turn, 
will have an opposite effect on information capacity. The three considered components, 
i.e. axonal, dendritic, and synaptic, have to be perfectly balanced in order to achieve the 
maximum  information  capacity.  This  balance  is  realized  when  axons  and  dendrites 
occupy equal fractions of neuropil given by the following function of the filling fraction 
only (see Methods for details): 

2. However, due to the constraint on the volume of neuropil, Eq. (3), the increase in 

will be accompanied by a reduction in the synaptic density,

measure volume fractions and filling fractions from the same brain, is needed in order to 
further justify the hypotheses that neuropil is optimally designed to store information in 
patterns of synaptic connectivity.

Conclusion  
 
We calculated volume fractions occupied by axons and dendrites in a neuropil optimally 
designed  to  maximize  information  storage  capacity  due  to  spine  remodeling.  These 
those  measured 
optimal  volume  fractions  are  not  significantly  different  from 
anatomically. This leads us to suggest that maximizing information storage capacity due 
to  spine  remodeling  may  have  been  an  important  driving  force  in  the  evolution  of  the 
cerebral cortex.      
  
 
Methods 
 
In  this  section  we  derive  the  expression  for  the  optimal  values  of  axonal  and  dendritic 
volume fractions [Eq. (4) in the main text]. This optimization problem, constrained by the 
fact that neuropil consists of several particular components, Eq. (3), is equivalent to the 
problem of finding the maximum of the Lagrange function,

We  search  for  the  maximum  of  the  function  I   by varying axonal and dendritic length

basic  geometry  of  axonal  and  dendritic  arbors,  geometrical  factor  sin( )θ   and  the 

average spine length,

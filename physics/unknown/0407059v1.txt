Abstract 

A  technique  using  RF  bucket  reduction  for  acquiring  information  about  the 

particle distribution in longitudinal phase space has been applied in the Fermilab Booster.  

Data  sets  were  obtained  at  six  important  time  intervals  of  a  Booster  cycle  for  three 

different  beam  intensities.  Controlled  RF  bucket  reduction  also  provides  other 

opportunities for beam manipulation. 

1  Introduction 

The 8 GeV beam from the Booster is sent to the Main Injector for further acceleration.  

The  longitudinal  emittance  (LE)  control  of  the  beam  in  the  Booster  is  especially 

important for some particular applications, such as slip stacking, proton coalescing, etc.  

We focus on understanding the relationship between the RFSUM curve during the cycle 

and the longitudinal emittance growth of the beam and on optimizing the RFSUM curve 

to make the LE growth a minimum while providing the required amount of acceleration.  

The  various  important  benefits  from  the  minimum  LE  growth,  such  as  reducing  the 

transition loss and accelerating higher intensity beam through the Booster cycle, motivate 

us  to  develop  a  technique  to  acquire  information  about  the  particle  distribution  in 

longitudinal  phase  space.    Whenever  a  change  is  made  to  the  RFSUM  curve,  the 

longitudinal phase space distribution and the LE of the beam bunches should be checked. 

Booster RF stations are divided into two groups called A and B.  The rf drive to the two 

groups can be adjusted as a function of time to any relative phase.  The A and B stations

are balanced so well that the vector sum of the RF voltages from all the cavities in the 

ring (RFSUM) is close to zero when group A and B stations are electrically 180 degrees 

out  of  phase.    A  low  level  system  curve,  which  is  called  the  primary  paraphase  curve, 

ordinarily controls the phase difference between group A and B stations during rf capture 

of the beam.  The primary paraphase curve brings the voltage vectors of groups A and B 

into phase relatively slowly such that efficient capture is achieved at injection.  By adding 

a  secondary  paraphase  curve,  we  can  adjust  the  value  of  RFSUM  at  any  time  in  the 

Booster cycle over the range from zero to a maximum determined by the anode and CIG 

curves.   

This  provides  a  means  to  achieve  RF  bucket  reduction  by  reducing  RFSUM  at  a 

particular  time  interval  in  the  Booster  cycle.    During  the  period  of  the  RF  bucket 

reduction,  one  should  observe  no  particle  loss  before  the  bucket  boundary  reaches  the 

bunch  boundary  in  longitudinal  phase  space.    We  do  start  to  see  charge  loss  when  the 

calculated bucket boundary reaches a plausible value for the bunch LE.  Further reduction 

of the RF bucket will cause more charge loss.  Since the RF bucket area can be calculated 

from the values of RFSUM and synchronous phase, one can obtain a rough determination 

of the beam emittance distribution from the intensity left in the calculated RF bucket.   

An  ambiguity  exists  in  the  above  measurement.    One  can  reduce  the  RFSUM  either 

slowly  (quasi-adiabatically)  or  rapidly  at  the  beginning  of  the  time  interval.    Here,  the 

limiting factor for the fast reduction of RFSUM is the Q factor of the RF cavities.  The Q 

factor is several hundred for the Booster, implying that cavity phases can change as fast 

as several Booster turns.  We chose fast reduction of RFSUM to simplify the bucket-area 

calculation  and  to  avoid  most  of  the  complications  of  time-dependent  parameters.    For 

example, a feedback loop works to counter the change made to RFSUM by modifying the 

synchronous phase.  If the synchronous phase is sufficiently changed, the change should 

be  included  in  the  bucket-area  calculation.    In  the  reported  measurements,  we  could 

neglect the feedback system since the particles outside the bucket were lost well before 

the  synchronous  phase  was  sufficiently  changed  because  of  the  gain  limitation  in  the 

Booster feedback system.  To make the feedback system stable, the gain of the feedback 

loop  is  set  such  that  significant  change  of  the  synchronous  phase  takes  considerably

longer than the fast voltage reduction.  Because the reduction of the RF bucket was fast, 

the initial value of the synchronous phase was used in calculating the bucket area. 

3  Experimental Result 

The most important time intervals in a Booster cycle are right after injection, 5 ms and 10 

ms  after  injection  when  instabilities  start  to  develop,  before  and  after  transition,  and 

before extraction.  So we chose six points, 0.9 ms, 5.5 ms, 10.4 ms, 14.4 ms, 19.1 ms, and 

29.5  ms  in  a  Booster  cycle  to  do  the  measurement.    We  applied  the  same  set  of 

measurements  to  three  different  beam  intensities.    They  are  two-turn  injection,  eleven-

turn injection and twelve-turn injection.  The results are shown in Figs. 1-3. 

4  Experimental Complication 

The  way  used  to  reduce  the  RF  bucket  area  is  directly  related  to  the  accuracy  of  the 

particle  distribution  measurement  in  the  longitudinal  phase  space.    One  concern  is  how 

long RFSUM should be kept at its minimum value in the fast reduction case.  If RFSUM 

stays low for too long, the beam will get lost due to a different reason.  The insufficient 

acceleration  makes  the  beam  develop  a  momentum  offset  to  the  synchronous  particle, 

until this momentum offset is large enough to reach the dynamical aperture.  The beam 

loss due to off-momentum scraping contributes to the experimental error.  See Fig.4 for 

details.  Another concern is the recapture of some particles outside the bucket.  If the time 

taken  for  particles  outside  the  reduced  bucket  to  be  lost  is  comparably  longer  than  the 

time taken for RFSUM to recover, some particles will be recaptured.  As shown in Fig. 5, 

there were some particles left even after RFSUM was reduced to zero.   

5  Application 

First, this technique can be applied to experimentally map the boundaries of the particle 

distribution  in  longitudinal  action  or  emittance.  That  can  be  used  to  specify  an  initial 

RFSUM  curve.    Afterwards,  tuning  the  initial  RFSUM  curve  based  upon  the 

improvement of the transmission efficiency and the reduction of the LE will be used to 

obtain the optimal RFSUM curve.  Since the optimal RFSUM curve is dependent upon 

 

 

 

 

3

the  beam  intensity,  this  process  should  be  applied  separately  for  different  beam 

intensities.   

At  the  present  running  conditions,  RFSUM  from  17  stations  is  sufficient  for  the 

acceleration.  The need for 18 stations is mainly to provide redundancy with one-station 

failure.    The  additional  accelerating  voltage  when  all  cavities  are  running  increases  the 

RF  bucket  size  and  contributes  to  the  extra  LE.    By  running  different  secondary 

paraphase  curves  for  17  stations  and  18  stations,  we  can  achieve  the  same  optimal 

RFSUM curve for 17 stations and 18 stations.   

By using the RF bucket reduction technique, we can control the time and the amount of 

the  charge  to  be  lost.    The  benefit  of  this  is  to  reduce  the  activation  of  accelerator 

components by disposing early in the cycle of protons that are destined to be lost anyway. 

6  Conclusion 

There  are  some  approximations  in  the  present  experiment,  such  as  assuming  no 

significant synchronous phase change during the fast bucket reduction and no significant 

beam  loss  due  to  scraping.    In  the  future,  we  should  record  the  synchronous  phase 

simultaneously when we are reducing the RF bucket area.  Besides that, RFSUM should 

be  reduced  in  such  a  way  that  the  scraping  because  of  the  insufficient  acceleration  is 

avoided.  This will require some pre-modeling work before the experiment.

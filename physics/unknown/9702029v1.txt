Abstract

Einstein equations for several matter sources in Robertson-Walker and

Bianchi I type metrics, are shown to reduce to a kind of second order nonlin-

ear ordinary diﬀerential equation ¨y + αf (y) ˙y + βf (y)

f (y) dy + γf (y) = 0.

Also, it appears in the generalized statistical mechanics for the most inter-

R

esting value q =

1. The invariant form of this equation is imposed and

−

the corresponding nonlocal transformation is obtained. The linearization of

that equation for any α, β and γ is presented and for the important case

f = byn + k with β = α2 n+1

(n+2)2 its explicit general solution is found. More-

over, the form invariance is applied to yield exact solutions of same other

diﬀerential equations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Exact solutions of the Einstein equations are diﬃcult to obtain due to their nonlinear

nature. There exist several interesting physical problems where the Einstein ﬁeld equations

for homogeneous, isotropic and spatially ﬂat cosmological models with no cosmological con-

stant [1]- [6] and for a time decaying cosmological constant [7], or Bianchi I-type metric [8]

with a variety of matter sources, reduce to particular cases of the second order nonlinear

ordinary diﬀerential equation

¨y + αf (y) ˙y + βf (y)

f (y) dy + γf (y) = 0,

(1)

Z

where y = y(x), f (y) is a real function and the dot means diﬀerentiation with respect to x.

α, β and γ are constant parameters.

Recently, it was shown that some galactic models of astrophysical relevance, when investi-

gated with the “generalized” Statistical Mechanics [9], can be exactly described by solutions

to the Boltzmann equations that maximize the Generalized Tsallis Entropy for q =

1 [10],

−

and it was found that the corresponding probability distribution function satisﬁes (1) [11].

It is believed that quantum eﬀects played a fundamental role in the early Universe. For

instance, vacuum polarization and particle production arise from a quantum description of

matter. It is known that both of them can be modeled in terms of a classical bulk viscosity

[12]. Using the relativistic second-order theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics called

Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics developed in [13] [14], it was considered a homoge-

neous isotropic spatially-ﬂat universe, ﬁlled with a causal viscous ﬂuid whose equilibrium

pressure obeys a γ-law equation of state, while the transport equation of the viscous pressure

is

with ǫ = 0 [15]. Following [16] for m = 1/2, it was shown in [1] that the expansion rate

satisﬁes a modiﬁed Painlev´e-Ince equation that has the form of (1) with f (y) = y and γ = 0.

Cosmological models with a viscous ﬂuid source have been studied using the full causal

irreversible thermodynamics with the full version of the transport equation for the bulk

viscous pressure [17] [5] [6]. Relating the equilibrium temperature T with the energy density

in the simplest way to guarantee a positive heat capacity, it was shown that the expansion

rate satisﬁes (1) for m = 1/2, with f (y) = y−1/r and γ = 0 [5]. Also, the early time evolution

of a dissipative universe, leads to an equation for the expansion rate that has the form (1)

[4], [18], in the relaxation dominated regime.

Another interesting example appears when an anisotropic universe, described by a

Bianchi type I metric, is driven by a minimally coupled scalar ﬁeld with an exponential

potential. The Klein-Gordon equation for the scalar ﬁeld and the Einstein equations for

the metric are expressed in term of the semiconformal factor G and their derivatives [19].

Then, the solutions of this equation set can be obtained if one is able to solve the following

Einstein equation for G,

which, making the substitution G = y1/c (3) becomes (1) [8]. A similar result is obtained

in the particular case when the Bianchi type I metric reduces to a ﬂat Robertson-Walker

space-time [2].

is a real number that characterizes the statistic and the sum is made over all the microscopic

conﬁgurations whose probabilities are pi. It leads to the conventional Boltzmann-Shannon

statistic in the limit q

problems, as the Generalized Freeman Disk [20] and Kalnajs oscillations of a slab of stars

[21]. Taking the generalized Fisher information for Tsallis Statistics [22]

where fd(x) is the probability distribution function, and solving the variational problem in

order to ﬁnd the distribution function that maximizes the Fisher information, a diﬀerential

equation of type (1) is obtained for y = ˙fd/fd, where f (y) = y, α = (2q

and γ = 0 [11]. For relevant physical applications the most interesting value of the statistic

parameter is q =

1 [10], in this case the above equations can be solved explicit and the

−

general solution will be given in section 3.

Thus, it turns out to be of great interest to analyze (1) from the physical and mathemat-

ical point of view. The paper is organized as follows, in section II we introduce an invariant

form and use it to reduce (1) to a linear, inhomogeneous ordinary second order diﬀerential

equation with constant coeﬃcients, by means of a nonlocal transformation. Then, its para-

metric general solution is given. In section III we extend the nonlocal transformation and

ﬁnd the explicit general solution of a modiﬁed Painlev´e-Ince equation for β = 1/9 [23]. In

section IV we use the nonlocal invariance to obtain a new class of diﬀerential equations for

which the general solution is found. In section V the conclusions are stated.

II. FORM INVARIANCE

The diﬀerential equation (1), which appears in several interesting physical problems,

has been solved and studied in particular cases using nonlocal transformations as it was

previously stated. To investigate (1) we write it in invariant form

¨y
f (y)

+ α ˙y + β

f (y) dy + γ =

+ α y ′ + β

f (y) d y + γ,

β

β
α2 =

β
α 2 ,

βc + γ = βc + γ,

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

where f(y) is a real function of y = y(x), the prime indicates diﬀerentiation with respect

to x. α, β, γ are constant parameters and c(c) is an integration constant provided by the

integral on the left(right) hand side of (6). By invariant form we mean that the left hand

side of (6) transforms into the right hand side under the nonlocal transformation deﬁned by

(7-10) for any functions f, f . The parameters α, β, γ, α and β satisfy (9-10).

The form invariance group can be used to linearize (1).

In fact, taking the function

f (y) = 1, α = α, β = β and γ = γ (this means c = c) in the invariant form (6) and the

transformation (7-10), they become

¨y
f (y)

Without loss of generality we choose c = c = 0. So, if the invariant (11) vanishes, then, (1)

transforms into

y ′′ + αy ′ + β y + γ = 0,

(12)

(13)

under the transformation of variables (12). This is a linear, second order ordinary diﬀerential

equation with constant coeﬃcients . Its general solution is

The real solutions can be classiﬁed as follows (we also assume that α, β and γ are real). For

we have a double-negative root for a critically damped solution. For α > 0 and β > α2

have two complex roots with negative real parts for a weakly damped solution. For the case

(17)

are the parametric equations for x and y in terms of x. In the particular case f (y) = y we

have shown that a class of nonlinear modiﬁed Painlev´e-Ince equation can be transformed

into a linear second order ordinary diﬀerential equation by a nonlocal transformation.

The theory introduced by Lie considers the invariance of the diﬀerential equations under

point transformations. He showed that the one-dimensional free particle equation has the

eight-dimensional SL(3,R) group of point transformations. This is the maximum number of

symmetry generators for a second-order diﬀerential equation of the form [24]

¨y + h( ˙y, y, x) = 0.

(18)

In our case (1) has the form of (18). Then, it has eight or less point symmetries. However, it

becomes (13) under the transformation of variables (12) and can be cast into the free particle

equation by a local point transformation. So, (13) has always eight symmetry generators.

We conclude this section observing that the nonlocal transformation (7-10) changes the

number of symmetry generators for the class of diﬀerential equations (1) and the physics

contained in the original problem.

A. The nonconstant parameters case

Here we allow the parameters in (1) and in the transformation (7-10) to be functions of

the independent variable, that is, α = α(x), β = β(x) and γ = γ(x). In order to preserve

the form (1) we choose α(x) = α(x) and β(x) = β(x). In this case, the invariant form (6)

reads

8

¨y
f (y)

+ α(x) ˙y + β(x)

f (y) dy + γ(x) =

+ α(x)y ′ + β(x)

f (y) d y + γ(x),

(19)

Z

Z

where x is the transformed of the point x. Therefore, taking γ = γ and f (y) = 1 we can

¨y + α(x)f (y) ˙y + β(x)f (y)

f (y) dy + γ(x)f (y) = 0,

(20)

linearize the equation

which transforms into

y ′′ + α(x)y ′ + β(x)y + γ(x) = 0.

An important physical problem of general relativity, concerning the motion of expanding

shear-free perfect ﬂuids [25], is governed by the ordinary diﬀerential equation

y ′′
f(y)

Z

¨y = F (x)y2,

where F (x) is an arbitrary function from which the equation of state can be computed. A

complete symmetry analysis of this diﬀerential equation was given in [26]. Here we see that

it is contained in the set of equations (20) when α(x) = 0, β(x) =

, γ(x) = 0 and

f (y) = y1/2. Then, choosing f(y) = (y)−1/2 in (7-10), the transformation of variables is

III. EXTENDED NONLOCAL TRANSFORMATION

The integral in (17) can be performed analytically and the general solution y = y(x) of

(1) obtained explicitly for a special set of functions f (y). For this purpose we generalize the

nonlocal transformation group deﬁned by (7-10) extending it to

f11(y) dy + f12(y) dx = f 11(y) d y + f 12(y) d x,

f21(y) dy + f22(y) dx = f 21(y) d y + f 22(y) d x.

For simplicity we begin our investigations restricting ourselves to the case x = x, that is,

f21 = f 21 = 0, f22 = f 22 = 1 and requiring the invariant form (6) to be invariant under the

remaining nonlocal transformation group, deﬁned by (26-27) with the above restrictions.

Under these assumptions we can write the nonlocal transformation as

where the functions p and q are expressed in terms of the functions f11, f12, f 11 and f 12. So,

they have a speciﬁc dependence on the variables y and y

˙y = p + q ˙y,

p(y, y) =

f12(y)
f 11(y) −

f 12(y)
f 11(y)

,

q(y, y) =

f11(y)
f 11(y)

.

(26)

Inserting (28) in (6) we get

Using (33) and comparing the coeﬃcients of ¨y we easily ﬁnd that f = y and f = y. But,

the comparisons of the coeﬃcients of ˙y and the remaining terms give the equations

11

It can be seen that the solutions of (37) are given by h = h0/y, where h0 is an arbitrary

function of the quotient y/y. So, the form of the solution for p is

Comparing (30) with (33) we have f 11(y) = 1/y, and comparing (29) with (38), we obtain

(32)

(33)

(34)

(36)

(37)

In the particular case in which the invariant form (41) vanishes, the l.h.s. gives rise to a

¨y + αy ˙y +

(where, without loss of generality we have taken c = c = 0, so that, γ = γ), that can be

solved using the invariance properties formulated above. To do this, we make α = 0 on the

r.h.s. of (41). Then, inserting its solution in (42), it can be integrated giving the general

solution

It can be seen that (43) has eight Lie point symmetries and it is equivalent to a second order

linear diﬀerential equation under a point transformation [27]. On the other hand, for any

other value of the coeﬃcient β

= 2α2

9 , (43) has two point Lie symmetries and we cannot ﬁnd

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(44)

(45)

a point transformation that cast it in a linear equation [27]. However, using the invariant

form (11) and the transformation of variables (12) for f = y, we have proved that (43)

can always be linearized whatever the value of the coeﬃcient of y3 is. Therefore, using the

invariance properties of the form (6) we have obtained the same results that come by the

Lie theory of symmetries. In addition, we have linearized (43) when it has less than eight

Lie point symmetries.

IV. SOLUTION OF NEW CLASSES OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

Now, we are going to investigate the case when the invariant expression (6) vanishes,

and we shall construct several important classes of solvable second order nonlinear ordinary

diﬀerential equations. To do this, we must seek the nonlocal transformation deﬁned by

(28,33) with the condition that the invariant (31) vanishes. This leads to the equations that

determine it

and we shall show a set of functions f, f for which the nonlocal transformation exists. The

solution of (46) can be obtained writing

p(y, y) = αyp0(y)(y) + p1(y) + p2(y, y),

where each function satisﬁes

(52)

(53)

where the ′ indicates derivative with respect to the argument of the function. Solving the

system (49-51) and inserting their solutions in (48), we ﬁnd the solution of (46), that is:

p(y, y) = α

f y d y +

h0(y/y)

.

Comparing (52) with (29), the function h0(y/y) is given by (39), but these terms can be

absorbed in a redeﬁnition of the integration constants provided by the two integrals of (52).

Then, without loss of generality we take them equal to zero.

From (47,52) we obtain the diﬃcult integrodiﬀerential equation that satisfy the functions

f and f . It reads

In what follows we shall show a set of functions f, f that are solutions of this integrodif-

ferential equation and construct three sets of nonlinear diﬀerential equations that can be

linearized and explicitly solved.

An interesting solvable equation set can be obtained when we choose the functions f, f as:

f = byn + k,

f = b y n + k.

(54)

A. Case a

14

Taking into account that the left hand side of (53) depends of y and its right hand side

depends of y, it must be a constant. So, inserting the functions given by (54) in (53) and

after some algebra, it provides the constrains satisﬁed by the parameters

that links (58) and (59). To integrate these equations we use their invariant property along

with (55-56) and analyze two diﬀerent cases. In the ﬁrst case, we choose b = 0, α = α,

k = k and n = n. Then, β = β by (56) and (59) reduces to a linear second order diﬀerential

equation for y = ˆy with constant coeﬃcients

Integrating (60) for the above value of the parameter, we obtain the general solution of (58)

which is invariant under the nonlocal transformation given by (60). It is easy to prove that

the new functions

F (¨y, ˙y, y) = F (¨y, ˙y, y) + δy,

F (¨y, ˙y, y) = F (¨y, ˙y, y) + δy,

This gauge symmetry generates a new nonlinear equation that can be linearized and solved.

In fact, when the invariant in (68) vanishes, it gives rise to a set of equations that transform

one on each other under the same nonlocal transformation, these are:

In particular, to solve (69) we choose b = 0, α = α, k = k and n = n (β = β by (56)) in

(70). Then, it reduces to

¨y + αk ˙y +

Inserting the solutions of (71) in (60) and integrating it for the selected parameters, we

reduce (69) to quadratures

For the particular case b = b = 1, k = k = 0, n = n = 1 and δ = γ, (69-70) reduce to

(43), the variable transformation (60) reduces to (42) and (64) gives the relation between

the variables y and y that leaves invariant (41).

There is an important result that can be deduced from (60) when α = α and k = k, in

and by (55-56)

(73)

(74)

So, if we take k(x) and δ(x) as functions of the independent variable x instead of constant

parameters, then, there is no change in the deduction of the variable transformation (73),

that comes from (46-47). This means that the set of equations (69-70) give rise to new

solvable equations that transforms between them by the nonlocal transformation (73)

For instance, to obtain the solutions of (75) we take b = 0 and n = n in (76) and it becomes

a general homogeneous linear second order diﬀerential equation

then, inserting the solutions of this equation in (72), we reduce (75) to quadratures.

We have introduced a new invariance concept that leads to classes of second order non-

linear ordinary diﬀerential equations which are equivalent under nonlocal transformations.

V. CONCLUSIONS

18

These classes contain a second order linear ordinary diﬀerential equation with constant co-

eﬃcients. The parametric expression of the solutions for an arbitrary function f (y) and any

values of the parameters α, β and γ, has been found. Also, the case in which these pa-

rameters are functions of the independent variable has been investigated. Several important

physical problems are mathematically described by these equation classes. Many of these,

arise in General Relativity when the Einstein ﬁeld equations are investigated for homoge-

neous, isotropic and spatially ﬂat cosmological models with no cosmological constant, or

Bianchi I-type metric with a variety of matter sources. Also, the probability distribution

function, which maximize the Fisher’s information measure in the generalized Statistical

Mechanics, was found to satisfy (43) for the most interesting value q =

1 [11].

−

Taking x = x in the nonlocal transformation, and imposing the form invariance of the

general expression (6), we have obtained a modiﬁed Painlev´e-Ince equation (43). The non-

local transformation of variables and the general solution of these equations has been found.

In this case the equation has the eight dimensional group of Lie point group symmetries

SL(3,R) and this is the maximum number of point symmetries that a second order diﬀeren-

tial equation can have. Other sets of new nonlinear second order diﬀerential equations are

generated, that can be linearized and solved explicitly (58,69,75). It is also to be remarked

that, the use and application of the form invariance have lead to exact solution of diﬀerential

equations whose solution were unknown, in particular for modiﬁed Painlev´e-Ince equations

and polinomical diﬀerential equations, which usually appear in problem related with quan-

tum eﬀects in the very early Universe, originated by the vacuum polarization terms and

particle production arising from a quantum description of matter, or when both of them are

modeled in terms of a classical bulk viscosity

19

In general, the problem of ﬁnding solutions of nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations

remains open. One direction along which one can proceed is to reduce them to a linear

ordinary diﬀerential equation. For instance, when (1) possesses eight-parameter Lie group

it is linearizable by a point transformation. On the other hand, the nonlocal transformation

(7-10) linearizes (1) even when it has less symmetries. Thus, it could mean that has more

nonlocal symmetries. We conclude that it is very interesting to study this kind of nonlocal

transformations of variables and their associated nonlocal symmetries, which have received

up to now little attention. We shall continue exploring this subject in future papers.

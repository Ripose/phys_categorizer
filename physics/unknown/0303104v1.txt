Abstract

At present, whenever we work in newtonian mechanics we consider momentum

to  be  a  three-dimensional  vector  or  a  4-dimensional  one  when  we  work  in  relativistic

mechanics.  However,  this  mathematical  vector  model  has  barely  200  years  and  its

complete installation in the physics is hardly more than 100 years old.

In  classical  mechanics,  based  on  point  particles  with  mass,  momentum  is

considered as a vector because the speed of the particle is applied on a single point and

the  mass  is  defined  only  at  that  point.  When  the  extension  to  classical  rigid  solids  is

made, that is, to solids that keep their shape, being so that the speed is defined to be the

same  for  each  and  every  point  where  the  solid  is  defined,  then  the  viewpoint  of

momentum as a vector is the simplest and more convenient approach.

Relativity  (restricted  and  general)  was  developed  in  the  decades  of  1900  and

1910 and quantum mechanics in the decades of 1920 and 1930. Relativity then impedes

the  existence  of  classical  rigid  solids.  The  maximum  speed  for  the  transmission  of

signals  prevents  a  body  from  varying  its  status  without  being  deformed.  On  the  other

hand,    quantum  physics  breaks  up  with  the  concept  of  point  particles  with  mass,

substituting this model for the one of the wave function defined in an extensive region

of the space (space-time in the quantum relativity). Can we really define, the moment of

a relativistic solid or of a wave function with a simple vector?

Introduction [1]

Momentum is a physical - mathematical concept whose origin goes back to the

times of the ancient Greece. Aristotle (384–322 A. D.) spoke about the movement of a

body as an inherent quality of the own object in function of its nature. In this way, the

nature of a stone is in the soil and for this reason the stone falls. Aristotle distinguishes

among  the  quantity  of  movement  that  two  bodies  can  develop  in  function  of  their

different masses.

This primitive concept of quantity of movement will be approached to by some

authors  of  the  Middle  Ages  who,  in  turn,  will  introduce  a  new  concept:  impulse  or

impetus.  The  impulse  became  the  quality  that  the  propelling  instrument  gives  to  the

object so that it maintains its movement. Then, it was regarded as a secondary cause.

Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) will be the first one to study the concept of inertia

experimentally,  using  ramps  or  inclined  planes.  Galileo  observed  that  a  moving  body

which  has  descended  along  an  inclined  plane,  ascends  along  another  one  back  to  the

initial height regardless of the inclination of the second ramp. Thus, he concludes that if

the second plane is horizontal and there would be not friction, the body would continue

moving indefinitely. This is one form of the principle of inertia.

Finally,  in  the  XVII  century  René  Cartesius  (1596-1650)  unifies  the  dispersed

concepts of quantity of movement, momentum, inertia, impulse, etc. and includes them

in only one concept to which he simply calls momentum and to which he identifies with
the expression p = m × v (momentum is equal to the mass of an object times its speed).

Unfortunately Cartesius got lost in metaphysical reasoning and he did not study in depth

the physics point of view.

Later,  Isaac  Newton  (1642  –  1727),  in  his  second  law  of  the  mechanics
established the form of the force like F = m × a, but it will not be until Leonhard Euler

(1701-1783) that the differential relationship 

 can be established. On the other

hand, Euler becomes aware of the importance of the kinetic energy T and he established

its relationship with the momentum as:

From the substitution of these two expressions, and knowing that when  a force

comes from a potential U, the form of this force is: 

 (for the one-dimensional

case), the second law of  Newton takes  the  form: 

.  This expression is

the starting point of the analytical physics of Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813). For a

coordinates  change  such  as  q=q(x) 

the  previous  expression 

takes 

the  form:

.  This  simplifies  the  mathematical  operations,  because  we  can  work

directly with  generalized coordinates. In such coordinates the form of momentum will

be:

Then, they will be Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782) and  Jean le Rond  d'Alambert

1717–1783) the ones who will introduce the vector calculus in physics, although vector

calculus will be introduced in the different branches of physics by different authors and

at different times until the arrival of the beginning of the XX century. The reason to use

vector  calculus  is  to  make  the  expressions  more  compact  and  intuitive.  In  its

components  form,  the  momentum  will  have  the  form

notation it will be:

Albert  Einstein’s  relativity  (1879–1955)  passes  from  the  three-dimensional

vector  calculus  to  four-dimensional  and  while  increasing  the  number  of  indexes  he

passed  the  expressions  from  vectorial  to  tensorial.  The  three-dimensional  momentum

vector  becomes  the  energy-momentum  four-vector.  The  reason  is  the  following  one:

energy, in analytic mechanics and in Cartesian coordinates has the form

that    energy  (divided  by  c)  is  the  “time”  component  of  a  four-vector  whose  space

components  are  those  of  the  linear  momentum.  This  is  endorsed  by  the  analytical

mechanics  thanks  to  the  fact  that,  when  the  action  S  is  a  function  of  the  coordinates

Wolfgang Pauli (1900 - 1958) introduces the concept of spin in the mathematical
formalism  as  the  product  of  the  traditional  scalar  wave  function  Φ   by  a  vector  αs

(called spinor), consequently getting the expression of  the  total  wave function to  have

the  form: 

s⋅Φ=Ψ

α

α

.  Soon  afterwards,  the  quantum  relativism  of  Paul  Dirac  (1902–

1984)  demonstrates  that  the  vector  or  tensor  construction  of  the  wave  function  is

something  innate  with  the  actual  relativist  treatment  of  quantum  mechanics.  It  only

changes where, instead of 2n+1 components of the spin vector for each state of spin n,

what we get is 2n indexes of 4 components each one, for each state of spin n.

The last step given by Pauli and Dirac implies, by substitution in the principle of

complementarity,  that  the  momentum  can  be  a  tensor  [3].  Why  did  the  physics  never

give  this  last  step?  What  sort  of  physical  meaning  may  have  something  like  a  tensor

momentum?, How should other mathematical expressions change their range?.

In this article we try to find some answers to this questions.

Magnitudes and physical qualities

The physical concepts used in physical theories are of two types [4]:

•  Physical magnitudes: they have material reality, as the mass or the speed.

•  Physical  properties:  they  are  qualities,  behaviours,  descriptions  an  so  on  but,  in

principle,  they  do  not  have  material  physical  reality  they  are  things  like  inertia,
gravity (as a concept) and force fields2.

It  is  quite  easy  to  confuse  those  abstract  properties  with  the  realities  of  the

physical  magnitudes  they  qualify  to,  and  to  which,  due  to  the  constant  use  of  the

language, they seem to represent. As an example, let us speak about the property we call

"inertia".

"Inertia"  is  a  quality  of  matter  according  to  which  every  material  object,  in

absence  of  forces,  tends  to  remain  in  its  state  of  rest  or  movement.  The  concept  of

inertia  is  the  description  of  a  particular  behaviour  of  the  object,  but  it  is  not  itself  a

physical  entity.  The  "inertia"  does  not  have,  then,  its  own  material  entity.  It  can  be

explained,  demonstrated  or  be  used  as  cause  or  consequence  of  other  physical

properties,  but  this  does  not  mean  it  can  become  something  material.  It  is  only  the

description of an observed behaviour.

In this sense, the mathematical form by which we implement the inertia will be

adjusted to the needs of the mathematical formalism that we use, as well as to the form

of the different physical laws.

                                                     
2  We  say  that  in  principle  they  do  not  have  material  physical  reality  because  they  are
products or constructions elaborated by the mind and, merely this does not make them
necessarily real. However, some of these may have physical reality, after all.

Quantum physics and the observables.

In  quantum  physics  only  observables  applied  on  wave  functions  have  material

entity, but not the observables themselves. When we say that, according to the principle

of  complementarity,  the  momentum  has  the  form: 

  [5],  we  are  not

providing any material fact or the result of any observation. Now then, when one says
that  the  momentum  of  a  physical  system  represented  by  the  wave  function  Ψ   is

−=Ψ
)
i

(

p

∂

,  we  are  certainly  giving  the  result  of  a  direct  physical  observation,

that is, a value for a magnitude. In this case, the result is a vector function. If a numeric

(vector)  result  were  desired  for  the  value  of  the  momentum,  it  would  be  necessary  to

calculate the auto-values of 

. If we want to know the probabilities of each value,

(Ψ

)

ip

then it would be necessary for us to decompose  Ψ  in the auto-functions of 

(Ψ

)

 and

ip

to calculate the amplitudes….

The field theories

The  field  theories  (such  as  relativistic  quantum  mechanics)  substituted  the

concepts of particle, object and matter by force fields, potential energy and space-time

metrics  [6].  Analytic  mechanics  is  applied  both  to  the  theories  of  particles  and  to  the

fields  ones and due to this,  the  Lagrangian,  Hamiltonian,  generalized  momentum,  etc,

can refer both to material objects and to force fields.

However,  a  great  difference  exists  between,  for  example,  the  momentum  of  a

particle (point) and of a field (like the electromagnetic): while the material particle has a

traditional momentum as a function of its mass and its speed, the field does not contain

in  itself  neither  mass  or  speed.  When  we  speak  about  the  momentum  of  a  field  we

suppose that we are applying the field to a particle, that is to say, our variables are the

parameters  that  define  the  point-particle.  However,  this  does  not  guarantee  that  the

momentum of the field (before being applied to the particle) is necessarily a vector.

The mass of a particle is a measurable physical magnitude, with a numeric value

(scalar). In this way, the speed of a particle is another physical magnitude that does not

only  have  a  numeric  value,  but  also  an  application  point  (the  position  of  the  particle)

and a direction. That is to say: it is a traditional vector. This is why, together with the

rules of the vector calculus  (according to which the product  of  a  scalar  by  a  vector  is

another  vector  whose  components  are  the  first  ones  multiplied  by  the  scalar),  the

momentum of a particle, defined by the product of the mass of the particle by its speed,

is also a vector.

This fact does not change from the point of view of the analytical mechanics for

point particles with mass. Since 

p

i

−∂=
S

∂

/

i

, for each value of the index  i, we have

one component of the 4-momentum.

However, when we are in theory of fields, the only thing that we know, a priori,

is  that,  once  the  particle  (point)  is  applied  with  its  parameters,  in  the  field,  the  result

should  be  a  vector.  This  condition  can  be  fulfilled  under  many  different  forms.  Two

examples are:

• 

In  absence  of  field,  the  4-vector  speed  has  the  form 

  and  the

momentum  is  calculated  by: 

i

p

=

umc

  [6].  In  this  case,  the  momentum  of  the

system is represented by a scalar: the mass of the particle times the light speed.

• 

In a homogeneous but not isotropic space, the momentum of a particle can have the

lineal form: 

(
umMp

)

. In this case, the momentum of the field has a matrix

i

=

j

⋅

i
j

form.

The  cause  of  the  difference  is  that,  momentum,  just  as  we  understand  it,  is

deeply  connected  to  the  concept  of  point  particle  with  mass,  and  this  it  is  one

cornerstone  of  the  whole  classical  physics.  If  we  wonder  what  is  the  momentum  of  a

rigid solid we usually  consider  the momentum  of their  mass  centre as  a  valid  answer.

But this is not exact, the momentum is distributed in the whole surface of the solid and

it depends of the angle that forms each facet of the surface with the vector speed. That is

to say, for a rigid solid, the momentum is a distribution function that depends of more

factors, besides the mass and speed of the object. The  momentum of  the rigid  solid  is

not then, a vector.

From the point of view of the fields theory, once we apply a particle to the field,

with its position, mass, charge, speed, etc., we can specify the value of all the traditional

magnitudes, as the momentum, and therefore we can return to the traditional mechanics

of point-like matter.

However,  from  the  viewpoint  of  a  pure  field  theory,  such  as  the  frame  of  the

relativistic  quantum  mechanics,  which  is  the  mathematical  form  of  physical  concepts

just as momentum, action, the Lagrangian or the Hamiltonian?

To summarize: the momentum of an individual particle (a point with mass) is a

vector. However, the momentum of a force field or a particle that is not a point (because

it  can  be  defined  by  a  distribution  function)  can  take  the  form  of  any  mathematical

expression, as long as whenever it is applied to a specific particle (a point with mass),

or,  after  the  necessary  approximations  are  made  to  consider  the  particle  as  a  point

(assuming,  for  example  that  the  interval  in  which  the  distribution  function  has  a  non-

zero value, it is insignificant in relation with the system) the  result is  a  vector.  In this

context, which is the mathematical form of the physical concepts just as the momentum,

the action, the Lagrangian or the Hamiltonian?.

Tensor magnitudes

To respond to the previous question, the easiest concept to be tackled, from the

quantum  point  of  view  is  the  momentum  because  the  principle  of  complementarity

gives us the following answer: as 

−=Ψ
)

 [5], then when  Ψ  is scalar 

(Ψ

)

ip

Ψ∂
∂
x

i

will be vector, but when  Ψ  has n indexes, 

(Ψ

)

ip

 will have n + 1 indexes.

But  this  easiness  does  not  indicate  that  this  fact  is  exclusive  of  the  quantum

theory. In classical theory of fields we have the case of a free particle. Its action can be

expressed in the form [6]:

a

Knowing that

 we can then observe that the action S is the norm of

an action tensor (vector) of the form:

Meaning of the tensor action and tensor momentum

 in quantum mechanics

What  is  the  meaning  of  a  tensor  action  or  a  tensor  momentum?  This  question

could  have  a  simple  answer  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  quantum  mechanics.  If  the

wave  function  is  tensorial,  this  is  due  to  a  quantum  effect  called  spin.  As  in  the

traditional physics  a quantum spin is  never observed  what  we  should  do  though,  is  to

work,  in those  cases in which  the spin  is not of  interest or  it  is  insignificant,  with  the

norm of the wave function.

In fact, we usually do that unconsciously. We know that, for particles with spin

½, the wave function is vectorial (spinorial), so that, we divide the wave function in two

components: a scalar and a vector one with its norm equal to the unit: 

s⋅Φ=Ψ

α

α

 with

Ψ=Φ

 and therefore 

1=αs

. We work with the scalar part scalar while we do not need

the spin, and whenever we need it, we work with the spin component directly.

However,  this  reasoning  involves  a  serious  defect:  the  spin  is  not  simply  a

quantum  effect  of  which  a  statistical  balance  can  be  made  so  that  its  effects  are  not

noticeable in macrosystems. The spin is the result of  applying  the quantum physics to

the relativistic structures.

For the quantum physics a particle is a duality of wave and corpuscle, that it is

distributed in the whole space-time. However, in relativity applied to matter just as we

understand it in macrosystems, only the point particles have meaning [6]. In fact, that is

the origin of the paradoxes produced by the famous EPR theorem [7].

Just as we saw earlier, a momentum vector cannot describe the momentum of a

rigid  solid,  because  it  is  not  a  point  particle,  in  relativistic  quantum  mechanics,  the

momentum  tensor  comes  to  tell  us  this  same  thing:  the  particles  described  by  wave

functions are not point-like. In fact, whenever we apply the concepts of linear or vector

momentum,  scalar  action,  Lagrangian,  or  Hamiltonian  or  any  other  physical  quantity

that is derived from the concept of point particle, we will find problems of undefinitions

that will only be sorted out by mathematics "recipes" such as the Wick product [8].

The  physical  meaning  of  a  linear  momentum  tensor,  in  quantum  physics,  is

deduced directly from the physical meaning of  a wave function  that is  not scalar.  The

components of spin of a wave function are due to fact that the solution of the relativistic

wave equation does not have representation in a Hilbert scalar space. Then it needs the
Cartesian product of 42n (being n the spin) spaces of Hilbert in order to be represented.

To say it in a more intuitive form: a particle of spin ½ cannot be represented by a point

in  a  Hilbert  space,  but,  certainly,  by  a  4-vector  in  a  4-space  of  Hilbert.  Just  as  the

momentum  of  a  particle  of  spin  1,  having  two  indexes,  cannot  be  represented  as  a  4-
vector in a 4 space of Hilbert, but as a matrix in a 4×4 space of Hilbert.

Another way of explaining it: a particle of ½ spin, being represented by a vector

with four components, comes to be represented by “the Cartesian product of 4 particles

of  zero  spin  (scalars),  each  one  in  a  Cartesian  axis  (of  Hilbert).”  As  for  each  of  the

particles  of  zero  spin  that  represents  to  our  particle  of  ½  spin,  we  can  calculate  a

momentum  vector  with  four  components,  the  particle  of  ½  spin  can  define  4  linear

momentum vectors with 4 components each, or what it is the same: a momentum matrix
with 4×4 components. As long as the space is a plane (a space of Minkowski) the four

momentum vectors of each particle will be parallel, but what does it happen when the

space is not flat, as in the case of the gravitational field?

Momentum in classical mechanics

Let us pass to the case of the classical mechanics. In this frame, the momentum

of an extensive body is usually expressed by the product of the speed of its mass centre

by  the  mass  of  the  solid.  However,  this  is  terribly  inexact  unless  we  make  some

approximations such as assuming that the dimensions of the body are negligible and/or

that the body is a rigid solid and/or the crashes are elastic or etc, etc.

The  traditional  form  of  the  momentum  of  a  body  corresponds  to  the  "sum"  of

each one of the momentums of the components that form the body. When the body is

usually  approximated  or  simplified  to  a  rigid  solid  it  is  being  said  that  the  speeds,  of

each one of those components, are equal in magnitude and direction. Therefore, the sum

is reduced to the sum of the masses:

r
p

r

, as 

r =  for all i, it is 
vi

r
v

r
p

(
= ∑

)
r

r
=
vMvm

⋅

i

This classical calculation is based on the assumption that the speeds of each of

the component parts of the body are all the same. However, in general, the speeds of the

different  parts  of  a  solid  depend  of  the  position  that  such  a  part  occupies  inside  the

body.  The  relativity  tells  us  that  a  minimum  time  delay  exists  for  an  alteration  to  be

transmitted from one point of the body to another, therefore, the speed of each point of a

body, even in the case of a rigid solid, cannot be the same if the body does not maintain

an uniform speed.

Let us suppose that a body is defined by the distribution function of its mass in
the three space coordinates, that is to say, by its function of mass density ρ(x, y, z). The

speed of each component is defined by means of a vector function for each point of the

space in which the body is defined. It assigns a vector value representing the speed in

that  point 

r =
v

r

,(

.  It  will  always  be  possible  to  decompose  this  function  as  the

sum:

(We use the convention of Einstein for the sum and for the repeated indexes, although at

the moment, the calculations  are  not  relativistic).  The  meaning  of  v(0)  is  the  speed  of

the mass centre. Since we are more interested in the variations of the speed than in its

constant  part,  we  could  always  choose  a  system  of  reference,  bound  to  the  body,  in

which this speed is equal to zero. However, we will not do it because, in this way, we

can obtain, at the end, a more intuitive approximation to the classical case.

On the other hand, the mass of the body will decompose in the sum of its parts.

Each part will have a mass (this is valid for both continuous as discontinuous bodies, it

only depends on the form of the density):

The momentum of the whole body is made with the sum of  each  and all of  its

parts. Therefore, integrating, and keeping in mind that v(0) is constant, we obtain:

When the body is a classical rigid solid, the partials of the speeds are zero and

the  second  term  is  nulled  (or  it  becomes  constant).  This  only  leaves  us  with  the  first

term  and  it  identifies,  as  we  said  earlier,  to  vα(0)  with  the  speed  of  the  mass  centre.

Nevertheless,  this  integral  will  not  be  equal  to  zero  elsewhere  than  in  systems  with

uniform speed. For any other ones, we will have to calculate the value of this integral.

Thus, in general, the momentum of a body is a function of the coordinates of the

part of the body where we measure it (just like the speed of the body). In the reference

system centred in the mass centre we can see that (we go beyond from the Greek sub-

indexes to the Latin ones to highlight that, from now on, the calculations are in the four

space-time coordinates), in the first approximation we have:

expressions  that  make  any  sense  are  those  among  parenthesis.  That  is  to  say:  the

Jacobiants.  The  Jacobiant  of  the  speed  and  of  the  momentum  are  the  only  two

expressions that do not make reference to a concrete point of the space, but to the set of

points where the body is defined.

On the other hand, given the linearity of these expressions, any property of the

vector function is also inherited by the Jacobiant. Therefore, the function:

P
ik

∂=

p

i

k

Behaves as the momentum of an extensive body.

Now, the units of the momentum will depend of the number of indexes that this

momentum  contains.  This  way,  the  momentum  vector  that  represents  a  point  particle
with  mass  will  have  the  units  of  Mass×Length×Time-1.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the

number of indexes is two, the units will be those of Mass×Time-1. Similarly, with three

indexes these units will be then: Mass×Length -1×Time-1 and so on.

These units have certain asymmetry. However, this asymmetry is caused by the

use of units that do not take into account the relativistic considerations, as well as by the

use of an ordinary speed vector instead of the 4-dimensional speed vector.

In relativity, the following form defines the 4-dimensional speed vector [6]

i

u

=

i

dx
ds

⋅=


,1γ







It is easy to observe that its units are null.

Now then, (continuing in relativity) in a no point-like body (extensive body) in

which the speed is not a vector in itself, but rather it will be so, depending of its position

in the space, (that is to say, for Vij, being Vi = Vij xj), the speed of the body Vij will have
units of Length  -1. In general, a system in which the speed is defined by n indexes, the
units of such speed will be of Length -n+1.

In this way, the units of the momentum, when it has n indexes, will be: Mass×

Speed×Length-n+1, matching with the traditional relativistic definition of the momentum

4-vector whose form is: pi = mc·ui and consequently its units are those of Mass×Speed .

Conclusion

Momentum is a physical–mathematical concept which definition depends of the

branch of physics in which we are focusing. Traditionally, this physical model was the

one  of  “point-particle  with  mass”  or  the  one  of  “rigid  solid”,  both  concepts  deeply

anchored in the newtonian physics. In both of these cases, the physical model represents

the  speed  by  a  vector  and  the  mass  by  a  scalar.  The  result  is  that  the  momentum  has

always been represented as a vector.

Still,  this  reduction  or  simplistic  vision  of  the  newtonian  physical  systems  has

been  carried  to  all  of  the  other  branches  of  physics,  both  in  field  theories  and  in

relativity or quantum physics, where the concept of a point-particle with mass, does not

make sense or generates paradoxes.

“A quantum–relativistic physical system will never be well defined if we use the

same  classical  and  intuitive  concepts  of  the  point-particles  with  mass  or  of  the  rigid

solids.” This is an idea all of us know well, but do we really apply it? And, if we do not

dare  to  properly  define  the  quantum–relativistic  physical  systems,  how  can  we  find  a

unique theory to describe these systems?

Abstract: A single-mode all-silica photonic crystal fiber with an effective area of 

600µm2 and low bending loss is demonstrated. The fiber is characterized in terms 

of attenuation, chromatic dispersion and modal properties.   

 

 

Introduction: The photonic crystal fiber (PCF) has since it was first proposed [1] 

attracted  growing  attention  due  to  its  many  unique  properties.  One  of  the  first 

special characteristics to be reported for the PCF was its potential to be endlessly 

single-mode (ESM) [2] referring to the absence of higher-order modes regardless 

of the optical wavelength. In the case of conventional fibers, the effective area is 

limited  by  the  fact  that  an  increasing  core  size  requires  a  correspondingly 

decreasing  index  step  between  the  core  and  the  cladding  in  order  to  maintain 

single-mode  operation.  This  imposes  requirements  on  the  control  of  the  index 

profile which is difficult to realize with index-raising doping of the glass. A PCF 

which  is  ESM  can  in  principle  be  scaled  to  an  arbitrary  dimension  and  remain 

single-mode.  However,  since  the  numerical  aperture  (NA)  decreases  with

M.D. Nielsen et al., “Single-mode Photonic Crystal Fiber with an effective area of 600µm2 and low bending loss” 

increasing  mode  size,  the  scaling  of  the  PCF  is  in  general  limited  by  macro-

bending  loss  and  micro-deformation  loss  due  to  the  decreasing  mode  spacing 

between  the  guided  mode  and  leaky  cladding-modes  [3,4].  In  contrast  to 

conventional  fibers,  the  bend-loss  edge  for  the  PCF  is  located  at  lower 

wavelengths compared to the transmission window [2] which is due to the fact that 

the mode spacing decreases with decreasing wavelength.  

In solid core Bragg fibers, effective areas of more than 500 µm2 at 1550 nm have 

been demonstrated but with attenuation levels in the order of dB/m [5]. PCFs with 

large mode-area have also been demonstrated [6,7]  but only for structures which 

are intrinsically susceptible to loss caused by bending and other perturbations. In 

this work we present a single-  mode PCF with an effective area of 600 µm2 and 

low bending loss. 

 

Fiber  design  and  properties:    The  considered  PCF  is  an  all  silica  fiber  with  a 

number of air holes, of diameter d, running along the length of the fiber, placed on 

a triangular lattice arrangement with a pitch Λ. The central air hole in the structure 

is  omitted  creating  a  high-index  defect  allowing  for  guidance  of  light  by  total 

internal  reflection.  For  the  relative  hole-size,  d/Λ,  below  a  value  of  0.41  the 

propagation loss of the higher- order mode (HOM) increases drastically and it is 

not considered to be guided [8]. For d/Λ larger than this value the propagation loss 

decreases and the structure now supports a HOM although the actual propagation 

loss might be significantly larger than that of the fundamental mode, causing the 

fiber in practice to act as a single-mode fiber. Pushing d/Λ to larger values has the 

benefit of increasing the mode spacing and in order to investigate these properties, 

a number of fibers with a fixed cladding diameter of 280 µm and Λ=23 µm were 

 

2

M.D. Nielsen et al., “Single-mode Photonic Crystal Fiber with an effective area of 600µm2 and low bending loss” 

fabricated,  with  d/Λ  ranging  from  0.45  to  0.53.  All  fibers  were  drawn  from  the 

same preform built using the stack and pull technique. The value of the cladding 

diameter  was  chosen  to  screen  the  waveguide  from  micro  deformations  [4].  The 

air-hole structure had 5 periods around the core and the fibers were coated with a 

single-layer actylate coating with a diameter of 426 µm. 

 

Characterization:  All  fabricated  fibers  were  characterized  in  terms  of  spectral 

attenuation  from  1100  nm  to  1700  nm  using  the  cut-back  technique.  When 

characterized on a spool with a radius of 8 cm, all fibers showed varying degrees 

of bending induced attenuation at 1550 nm. However, on a spool of 16 cm radius 

the bend-loss edge of most fibers had moved to wavelengths lower than 1550 nm 

although fibers with d/Λ < 0.48 were still  influenced by the tail of the  bend loss 

edge.  The  fibers  with  the  largest  d/Λ  value  of  0.53  showed  indication  of 

supporting a high-order mode which was confirmed by inspecting the near field on 

a  50  cm  sample.  The  fiber  with  d/Λ  of  0.50  was  single  mode  in  the  inspected 

wavelength  region  and  not  influenced  by  the  bend-loss  edge.  In  Fig.  1,  the 

attenuation  spectrum  of  this  fiber,  measured  on  a  150m  sample,  is  shown.  The 

steep  bend  loss  edge  is  located  at  ~1200nm  with  a  loss  tail  extending  to  the 

position  of  the  OH  absorption  peak  at  1.38  µm.  The  attenuation  is  5  dB/km  at 

1550 nm at which is in good agreement with the recorded OTDR trace shown in 

the  insert  of  Fig.  1.  The  low  backscatter  intensity  observed  in  the  OTDR 

measurement results from the low NA of the fiber which is estimated to be 0.04. 

The  attenuation  level  at  1550  nm  is  mainly  attributed  to  absorption  caused  by 

contamination  introduced  during  the  fabrication  process  such  as  OH  and  other 

impurities on the surfaces on the capillary tubes used to construct the preform. The 

 

3

M.D. Nielsen et al., “Single-mode Photonic Crystal Fiber with an effective area of 600µm2 and low bending loss” 

attenuation level is similar to what is observed in fibers with significantly smaller 

Λ  when  using  the same  fabrication  process,  and  may  be  drastically improved  by 

applying surface polish of the capillaries and dehydration techniques.   

 

 

In  Fig.  2,  the  measured  chromatic  dispersion  from  1520  nm  to  1640  nm  (solid 

line) and the material dispersion of pure silica (dotted line) are shown along with 

the  waveguide  dispersion  (dashed  line)  obtained  from  a  numerical  simulation 

using  the  plane-wave  expansion  method.  The  waveguide  dispersion  is  almost 

constant  with  a  value  of  1  ps/(km·nm)  and  the  chromatic  dispersion  is 

consequently  dominated  by  the  material  dispersion  with  a  value  of  23.3 

ps/(km·nm) at 1550 nm. 

Based  on  the  values  of  d/Λ  and  Λ,  the  effective  area,  Aeff,  can  be  simulated 

yielding  a  value  of  591  µm2  which  corresponds  to  an  equivalent  Gaussian  1/e2 

mode-field diameter (MFD) of 27.4 µm. In order to verify this experimentally, we 

study  the  near  field  at  1550  nm  shown  as  a  contour  plot  in  the  insert  in  Fig.  3 

which also defines the two orthogonal directions x and y. In Fig. 3, the intensity 

profile  of  the  near  field  along  the  x  and  y  direction  is  shown  (open  circles  and 

triangles,  respectively).  As  seen  from  these  profiles,  the  mode  has  a  close  to 

Gaussian  shape  which  is  indicated  by  the  two  fitted  Gaussian  functions 

(represented by the dashed and dotted line for the x and y direction, respectively). 

However, the near field is not rotational symmetric in the transverse plane but has 

a hexagonal shape leading to a difference in the 1/e2 MFD which can be extracted 

from  the fits along the two directions. For the x direction,  the MFD of the fitted 

Gaussian is 27.9 µm and for the y direction it is 29.8 µm. The 1/e2 width obtained

M.D. Nielsen et al., “Single-mode Photonic Crystal Fiber with an effective area of 600µm2 and low bending loss” 

directly from the raw data yields 25.5 µm and 29.2 µm for the x and y direction, 

respectively, corresponding to  an average value  of 27.2 µm. All  measures of the 

MFD can thus be given as 27.7 +/- 8% which is in good agreement between the 

calculated  value  of  Aeff.  For  Aeff  =600  µm2, 

the  nonlinear  coefficient, 

γ=2πn2/(λAeff),  yields  a  value  of  0.16  (W·km)-1,  where  n2=2.4·10-20  m2/W  is  the 

nonlinear refractive index of pure silica. 

  

Conclusion:  We  have  demonstrated  a  PCF  with  an  effective  area  of  600  µm2  at 

1550 nm by optimizing d/Λ to a value of 0.50 and thereby achieving both single-

mode operation and low bending loss.

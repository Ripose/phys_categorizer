Abstract: The instant Lagranian coordinator system is used to describe the fluid material motion. By this way, the 

instant  deformation  gradient  (expressed  by  spatial  velocity  gradient)  concept  is  established.  Based  on  this 

geometrical understanding, the strain rate and stress is expressed by local rotation tensor which is simply based on 

the  fluid  material  kinetic  energy  concept  (ruling  out  the  concept  of  fluid-stretching).  For  fluid  filling-in 

experiments,  the  characteristic  of  turbulence  is  analyzed  geometrically  and,  then,  the  Navier-Stokes  equation  is 

used to get the analytical solution in first-order approximation. For convenient the comprising with experiments, 

the  related  typical  values  are  given.  As  this  solution  is  very  basic,  it  can  be  expected  be  valuable  for  industrial 

application.

1. Introduction 
 

Keywords:  spiral  expansion,  turbulence,  local  rotation,  velocity  gradient,  deformation  mechanics,  fluid 
continuum mechanics 

The  turbulence  phenomenon  is  heavily  related  with  low  density  fluid  (such  as  water)  and  /or 

low-viscosity fluid (such as air). Traditionally, the velocity gradient is used to describe the motion of 

fluid  as  continuum  [1].  Using  strain  rate  and  Navier-Stokes  equation,  its  effectiveness  for 

non-turbulence  flow  is  widely  accepted.  However,  for  turbulence,  very  hard  to  say  it  can  give  out 

first-order approximation even for the simple fluid filling-in experiment which is mentioned in many 

text books and is observable in daily life. 

Lodge  [2]  points  out  that  the  geometrical  description  of  fluid  material  instant  motion  is  very 

important.  He  tried  to  use  the  body-tensor  to  expresses  the  fluid  motion.  However,  for  Lagranian 

coordinators,  tracking  the  fluid  material  become  non-possible  for  turbulence.  Even  in  color  fluid 

filling-n experiment, the mixture feature of fluid material will make the Lagranian coordinator system 

be indefinable.   

As it is known that the velocity gradient will determine an instant configuration deformation, the 

continuum  mechanics method is widely used to attack the turbulence problem. For fluid, on intrinsic 

sense, the stretching like in elastic material is not acceptable. Therefore, many statistic models [3] are 

developed  where  the  fluid  material  is  viewed  as  particles.  However,  in  experiments  the  symmetrical 
ije   indeed can be calculated and the stress can be tested. Therefore, it is identified that the 
strain rate 
turbulence is related with the vorticity in some intrinsic ways [4-5]. This interpretation, in fact, rules 

out the stretching concept for turbulence although some researchers tried to save the stretching concept 

as  the  symmetrical  strain  is  always  accompanied  with  turbulence.  This  contradict  is  very  sharp  in 

very-low viscosity fluid. 

This  geometrical  problem  is  solved  in  this  research  based  on  Chen  Zhida’s  S+R  decomposition 

[6-7]  for  deformation  tensor.  In  Chen’s  theory,  the  S  represents  intrinsic  stretching.  For  very-low 

viscosity fluid, it is zero. Then the R (orthogonal rotation) is the unique tensor to describe the intrinsic 

motion of fluid material. According to his theory, the R is completely defined by the vorticity. The most 

striking feature is that the S=0 will logically require that the symmetrical strain rate must exist and can 

be  completely  expressed  by  vorticity.  As  the  vorticity  is  related  with  the  anti-symmetrical  velocity 

gradient tensor component, therefore such a theory is still in continuum mechanics range. As it is seen 

in this paper, the intrinsic reason for the symmetrical strain rate is the material local rotation it has no 

relation with the elastic stretching for very-low viscosity fluid. Rather, it is the non-stretching feature 

makes the local rotation must form the symmetrical strain rate. Therefore, the symmetrical strain rate 

for non-stretchable fluid is well explained by local rotation in this research. 

The century efforts to solve turbulence problem have raised the doubt whether the Navier-Stokes 

equation  can  solve  the  turbulence  problem  [8].  This  paper  will  not  address  this  problem.  After  the 

geometrical  problem  is  solved,  the  research  directly  uses  the  Navier-Stokes  equation  to  get  the 

first-order analytical solution. The results can well explain the fluid filling-in phenomenon with testable 

filling-in parameters and fluid feature. Sure, strict exact experiments are waiting to be done in future to 

check the accuracy of the solutions. 

The paper will firstly define the motion of fluid material with R geometry. Secondly, the geometry 

is  used  to  expresses  the  classical  symmetrical  strain  rate  and  stress.  After  the  mechanics  description 

about the characteristic of turbulence for fluid-filling-in experiments results, the paper goes to use the 

Navier-Stokes  equation  to  establish  the  motion  equation  and  get  its  analytical  solution  with  the 

boundary condition at filling-in hole position. 

 
2. Basic Definition Equations for Very-low Viscosity Fluid Motion 

 

For an element of fluid material, it is described by inertia velocity field

  where the 

inertia  coordinator

ix   is  named  as  spatial  coordinators.  For  a 

reference  time

this way, the same material element can be identified by the same coordinator at a tater time

Therefore,  the  rate  deformation  gradient  tensor 

i

jF   is  interpreted  as  the  unit-time  base  vector 

transformation tensor. 

For simplicity in this paper, the standard rectangular coordinator system is selected as the spatial

standard  rectangular  coordinator  system.  That  means

.  By  this  way,  the  instant  dragging

Here,

Where, tensor 

ijg is the gauge tensor of instant dragging coordinator system,  ρis mass density. 

  Without  generality  loss,  taking  the  time  interval  be  unit,  for  the  unit-volume  material  element, 

unit-time kinetic energy variation related with fluid deformation can be expressed as:

                                          (8) 

Using Equation (1), it can be rewritten as unit-time unit-mass kinetic energy variation:

                        (9) 

Hence, a new velocity

                                                                              (10) 

From geometrical consideration, the spatial coordinator  x , at unit time late, will be redefined as the 

instant Lagranian coordinators. As at a unit time late, the spatial coordinators  x will be taken by new 
iU   as instant Lagranian velocity to distinguish 
material element, it is reasonable to name the velocity 
from the inertia velocity of the new material element. When the unit time interval is small enough for 

the fluid motion under discussion, as a limit, the differences between the actual position of the material 

element  and  the  spatial  coordinators  position  can  be  ignored.  In  this  sense,  the  instant  Lagranian 

velocity can be defined in the spatial coordinators system. Thus, in each spatial position, there are two 

velocity fields: inertia velocity and Lagranian velocity. 

 

By this way, the related calculation can be taken at the spatial coordinators with the understanding 

that the material indifference principle is maintained. 

Observing  Equations  (9)  and  (10),  according  to  geometrical  consideration  related,  the  unit-time 

base  vector  transformation  tensor  must  be  orthogonal  tensor.  On  the  other  hand,  such  an  orthogonal 

tensor must be expressed by inertia velocity field. Such an orthogonal tensor does exist. This will be 

discussed in next section. 

 

   

3. Strain Rate and Stress Tensor for Turbulence 

Observing Equations (9) and (10), there are three possible orthogonal rotations which correspond 

to  positive,  zero,  and  negative  unit-time  unit-mass  kinetic  energy  variations  respectively.  As  the 

orthogonal expansion and contraction corresponds to a special case for this paper, it will be discussed a 

3.1. Positive or Negative unit-time unit-mass kinetic energy variations 

For non-zero unit-time unit-mass kinetic energy variations, (ruling out the anisotropic orthogonal 

expansion) the orthogonal rotation tensor can be written as:

Based  on  related  research  (Chen  ZD  and  Xiao  JH  [10]),  for  arbitral  velocity  gradient,  the

It means that the classical strain rate is completely determined by the curl of velocity field.   
 
 

For very-low viscosity  µ  fluid, the classical stress is:

The  stress  is  simply  the  static  stress,  therefore  such  a  motion  mode  can  be  ruled  out  for  turbulence 

discussion  in  this  paper.  For  compressible  fluid  or  incompressible  fluid  with  bubble,  its  contribution 

can be absorbed into the static pressure (or more exactly, dynamic pressure). 

Summering  above  research  results,  for  incompressible  fluid,  only  two  orthogonal  rotations 

(Equation (11) and Equation (25)) can be related with turbulence. In the following section, this theory 

will be used to explain a typical turbulence phenomenon. 

4. Characteristics of Turbulence Structure for Simple Filling Mode 
 

Considering a kind of color fluid is filling into an infinite tank containing very-low viscosity fluid 

through  a  small  hole  (see  Fig.  1).  When  the  filling  velocity  is  high  enough,  turbulence  flow  will  be 

formed, which can be observed by the color fluid motion. For simplicity, the color fluid is supposed to 

be the same kind of fluid with the fluid in tank but colored. The filling direction (the normal of filling 

, the other two coordinators are selected as shown in Fig.1. The zero point is 

side) is taken as 
selected at the center of filling hole.

4.2. Orthogonal Rotation at the Positive Kinetic Energy Variation Zone 
For static low viscosity fluid with static pressure 0p , when the color fluid is filling into the tank, 
the material element near the filling hole will have positive unit-mass unit-time kinetic energy variation. 

As (at  the hole  position)  the  rotation  is  along  the filling-in direction,  it can  expect  that  near  the hole 

position the rotation will divert from this direction. Because along the rotation direction the orthogonal 

rotation gives out a positive stress component contribution, there must exist a zero stress surface. This 

surface is defined by the equation:

The Equation (45-2) shows that the principle direction of strain rate is just the rotation direction. Only 

on  the  rotation  direction,  the  equations  have  a  solution.  Using  the  rotation  direction  as  the  reference 

frame, the stress and strain rate is:

It  means  the  original  static  fluid  material  will  rotate  along  the  rotation  direction  with  this  speed.  It

                                  (47-4) 

It shows that once the color fluid material moving out from the hole position zone, the absolute value is 

increased.  (It  means  the  input  energy  will  finely  be  converted  into  internal  energy  related  with 

temperature). The difference between the color and non-color material will make the unit-volume fluid 

form micro-scope turbulence. However, this problem will not be addressed here. 

Therefore,  along  the  rotation  axe

As only the rotation direction strain rate is non-zero, the color fluid will travel along the rotation 
. Hence, the color fluid will be concentrated in 

θ

critical

the special region defined by zero-pressure surface.   

Watching  from  z   direction,  the  color fluid  trace  center  is  spiral  expansion  line while  the  color 

fluid circulates around the trace center (see Fig.1).   

Along  spiral  expansion  line  along  the z direction,  between  the  zero-pressure  trace  and  the  hole 

position,  the  color  material  has  the  largest  Lagranian  velocity  absolute  value.  After  it,  the  non-color 

fluid material with Lagranian velocity absolute value ranging from 

U

critical

to 

U

critical

  will followed. 

They form a tail for the turbulence. This region is characterized as the speeding-up region. 

In the zero-pressure region, the rotation axe direction will be further diverted, therefore the color 

fluid material will be diverted further. Thus, the zero-pressure region will disappear and the stress will 

be negative. In fact, the motion of the zero-pressure face is the turbulence center.   

4.3. Orthogonal Rotation at the Negative Kinetic Energy Variation Zone 

According to above research, the color fluid will be firstly rotate along  z direction, and gradually 

diverted from  z direction , then comes into the zero-pressure surface. During this process, the original 

static fluid is mixed with the color fluid. That makes the color fluid can transport its kinetic energy to 

the original static fluid.

The  continuity  of  stress  and  strain  rate  can  never  be  achieved.  However,  in  fact,  the  deformation  is 

continuous.  This  means  that  what  modes  will  take  dominant  position  will  depends  on  the  boundary 

condition. To solve this problem, let’s recall the related turbulent experiment like showing in Fig.1. 

The  related  experiments  show  that  the  trace  of  color  fluid  is  continuous.  That  means  that  the 

rotation direction must be continuous. Hence, at critical transition point, there exists: 

~
L =
i

To  make  the  stress  and  strain  rate  be  continuous,  an  isotropic  expansion  strain  rate  must  be 

stacked on the

  mode. Let it be:

Combining Equations (50), (52), and (53), the stress and strain rate continuity will require that:

means that the transition is achieved through an isotropic expansion. For isotropic expansion, the color 

fluid material will go every direction. 

The critical transition point unit-time deformation can be expressed as: 

 

 

 

 

                                                                              (56)

  What  does  mean  by  the  critical  transition  point?  The  most  striking  feature  is  that  the  isotropic 

expansion  may  produce  bubbles  in  the  fluid.  In  fact,  the  bubbles  are  intrinsic  feature  for  turbulence 

which is observed in many experiments. Under this understanding, the  k   is the bubble production rate 

of unit-volume element. Putting the bubble production rate as the intrinsic feature of fluid, the critical 

transient point is completely determined by it. For this understanding, Equation (53) gives the bubble 

strain rate with the bubble velocity field 

iu . 

For this zone, the rotation angular will jump from  θ to  Θ . Comparing Equations (17) and (31), 

the  Θ   is bigger than  θ , therefore the rotation angular is jumped again (see Fig.1). 

4.4. Random Distribution of Rotation Direction and Turbulent Decaying 

Observing  Equation  (55),  the  critical  value  k   is  completely  determined  by  the  curl of velocity 

field. The isotropic expansion will finely decay into random distribution of rotation direction. In this 

case, the turbulence disappears (see Fig.1).   

However,  if  no  bubble  is  produced,  there  is  only  one  possible  way  to  make  the  stress  be 

continuous. That is to let the rotation direction 

  is homogenous distribution on positive  z direction.

Introducing the dynamic pressure  p , by Equation (21-2) , it can be defined as: 

The  volume  expansion  rate  of  turbulence  zone  can  be  completely  attributed  to  the  filling-in

Where,  the  Ω   is  the  total  volume  of  the  tank.  Hence,  the  angular 

randomθ

  is  determined  by  fluid 

feature and filling-in pressure. Therefore, although the fluid motion is random, its turbulence feature is 

deterministic.

  mode,  let  the  rotation

By Equations (58-1) and (58-2), it is completely determined by fluid feature and filling-in pressure. 

Once  the  unit-time  deformation  mode  is  changed  into

Summering the discussion in this section, the turbulence feature can be divided into four typical 

zones: (1) Initial Zone, which is deterministic speeding-up zone; (2) Spiral Expansion Zone, which is 

terminated by zero-pressure surface; (3) Bubble Zone, where the spiral expansion is accompanied with 

bubble production; (4) Random Zone, the turbulence finished suddenly. The related typical quantities 

are shown in Fig.2.

5.1 Solution of Center Trace 

Near  filling-in  hole  position,  the  rotation  can  be  simplified  by  the  rotation  along  filling-in 

direction. At later time, the centre trace are steadily along the    filling-in direction with a limit diversity. 

For the centre trace, the rotation direction vector components can be approximated as:

This  position  defines  a  plane  where  the  symmetric  stress  is  identical  with  the  static  pressure.  So,  it 

defines the end position of turbulence. Surely, the pre-condition is that the near-hole solution keeps a 

good approximation, which depends on the filling-in parameters and fluid feature. After this position, 
the strain rate 
  will be negative. The negative sign shows that the rotation direction will be diverted 

33e

from the  z   direction. Therefore, it becomes the conventional fluid flow. 

 

The other two spatial velocity components can be determined by solving definition equations with 

suitable boundary condition. However, for this paper, this solution is not required. So, they will be not 

discussed.

The  parameter  a   measures  the  diversity  of  rotation  direction.  For  centre  trace,  it  is  zero.  Hence,  it 

measures the size of color material around the centre trace.

Its absolute value is increased with the  z   coordinator increasing, as the angular 

centreθ

  is decreased. 

For 

> 1ρ

b−

,  a   is  negative.  It  does  mean  the  diversity  of  rotation  direction.  However,  for 

< 1ρ

b−

  ,  a   is  positive.  It  means  the  diverted  rotation  will  concentrate  toward  the  trace  center. 

Therefore, the critical value of fluid mass density is unit density.   

As  the  water  has 

1≈ρ ,  for 

1<ρ   the  color  trace  will  be  very  narrow  and  sharp.  The  trace  is 

clearly observable. For 

1>ρ , the color trace will be much wider. So, the water is very sensitive for 

turbulence. For 

2

> ρ , a critical rotation direction 

>

  can be defined as:

If its value is near 1, it means the rotation is nearly on the 

z =

const

  plane. So, for fluid mass density 

2

> ρ , it defines a cone face boundary for the maximum direction of rotation axe. For 

>

1

2≥ρ

, 

such  a  boundary  does  not  exist.  Hence,  to  make  the  turbulence  trace  be  clearly  viewed  for  fluid 

filling-in experiments, the mass density must be carefully selected. 

Generally speaking, the solutions (78) and (69-1) describe the characteristics of turbulence in first 

order approximation. 

At  least,  the  approximation  has  enough  accuracy  before and near  the  zero-pressure  surface.  For 

bubble zone and random zone, the approximation should be replaced by other solutions. In this case, 

one  must  use  the  (62)  to  find  the  correct  solution  although  it  is  very  difficult.  However,  as  the  two 

modes have competition in this region, the bubble feature and other factors must be defined by other 

physical  consideration  rather  than  limited  to  Equation  (62).  For  example,  the  Equation  (55)  must  be 

applied for bubble case. This topic is out the range of this paper, so it will not be discussed further. 

Summering  up  the  results  in  this  section,  the  turbulence  centre  region  has  first-order 

approximation  analytic  solution  (that  is  the  Equations  (69-2)  and  (78).  The  related  quantities  can  be 

calculated according to their corresponding equations. Hence, the conclusion is that this research gets 

the  first-order  analytical  solution  for  turbulence  produced  by  fluid  filling-in.  As  this  solution  is  very 

basic, it can be expected be valuable for industrial application. 

 

 

 

 

6. Conclusion 
 

This  research  shows  that  for  the  turbulence  phenomenon,  the  geometrical  description  of  fluid 

material instant motion is very important. As it is known that the velocity gradient will determine an 

instant configuration deformation, the fluid motion is frequently treated in continuum mechanics. For 

fluid,  on  intrinsic  sense,  the  stretching  like  in  elastic  material  is  not  acceptable.  However,  in 
ije   indeed can be calculated and the stress can be tested. This 
experiments the symmetrical strain rate 

contradict  is  very  sharp  in  very-low  viscosity  fluid.  The  century  efforts  to  solve  turbulence  problem 

have  raised  the  doubt  whether  the  Navier-Stokes  equation  can  solve  the  turbulence  problem.  As  it  is 

seen in this paper, the intrinsic reason for the symmetrical strain rate is the material local rotation it has 

no  relation  with  the  elastic  stretching  for  very-low  viscosity  fluid.  Rather,  it  is  the  non-stretching 

feature  makes  the  local  rotation  must  form  the  symmetrical  strain  rate.  Therefore,  the  symmetrical 

strain rate for non-stretchable fluid is well explained by local rotation in this research. 

 

After solving contradict between the symmetrical strain rate for non-stretchable fluid, the research 

shows that the Navier-Stokes equation can be used to give the correct results for the turbulence. In fact, 

the first-order analytical solution for turbulence center region is obtained in the paper. No need to say 

that the results must be examined by experiments. For convenient the comprising with experiments, the 

related typical values are given. However, as the most available experiments do not supply the needed 

parameter  for  the  view-point  of  the  research,  the  author  cannot  finish  this  job.  So,  it  is  hopping  that 

some valuable experiments be done somewhere. As this solution is very basic, it can be expected be 

valuable for industrial application.

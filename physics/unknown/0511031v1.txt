I- INTRODUCTION 

- 2 - 

The  dramatic  slowing  down  of  flow  and  relaxation  that  leads  to  glass  formation  in 

liquids and polymers as temperature decreases is still a much debated topic among chemists 

and physicists. However, a distressing aspect of the problem is that there is no agreement on 

even a zeroth order description of the phenomenon. 

For  instance,  the  question  of  whether  slowing  down  results  from  congestion  of  the 

molecules  and  drainage  of  free  volume  as  density  increases  with  decreasing  temperature 

under usual isobaric conditions or from the decrease of thermal energy required to surmount 

higher and higher  activation  barriers  as temperature is lowered (or  from  both effects)  is not 

settled. At one end of  the spectrum, free-volume  theories and hard-sphere models stress the 

density effect whereas at the other end, approaches in terms of activated processes emphasize 

the  temperature  factor.  Repulsive  colloidal  systems  most  certainly  fall  in  the  category 

described by the former  theories and covalently  bonded network-forming glassformers most 

certainly in that described by the latter; but what about most glassforming molecular liquids 

and polymer melts? It is reasonable to expect that both density and temperature play a role, 

and  this  can  be  quantitatively  assessed  by  studying  ratios  characterizing  in  a  model-free 

manner the  relative contributions of density and temperature to the experimentally observed 

slowing down of relaxation at constant pressure. Several more or less equivalent ratios have 
been  proposed1,2. From the available data, it  appears that  temperature on the whole is more 
important  than  density  (see  Fig.1  in  ref  3),  but  except  in  a  few  cases  such  as  glycerol4,  the 

dominance is far from overwhelming (and the opposite effect has also been observed in a few 
instances5). 

An  interesting  piece  of  information,  however,  is  provided  by  the  evolution  with 

increasing relation time (or viscosity) of the relative importance of density and temperature in 

the slowing down. Data are rather scarce, but all show a decreasing influence of the density as 
one  approaches  the  glass  transition  (whatever  the  thermodynamic  path  followed)6.  This 
observation, which is clearly at odds with a free-volume picture7, suggests that the proposed 

ratios somewhat keep the memory, even at low temperature close to the glass transition, of the 

high-temperature  liquid  phase  in  which  density  and  temperature  are  more  likely  to  play  a 
comparable role. This led us a few years ago 8 to propose a simplifying scaling hypothesis in 
which  the  influence  of  density  of  the  a -relaxation  time  t

  or  the  viscosity  h

  is  simply 

described via a single parameter, an effective density-dependent interaction energy E¥ (r ) that 
is characteristic of the high-temperature liquid regime8,3.

In  the  following,  we  first  recall  the  scaling  procedure  and  its  application  to 

experimental  and  numerical  data  on  glassforming  liquids  and  polymers.  We  next  consider 

what use can be made of the existence of such a scaling and derive a number of relations that 

automatically  follow  for  the  scaling  form.  Finally,  we  discuss  the  physical  content  of  the 

scaling  and  of  the  density-dependent  energy  parameter,  including  some  recently  proposed 

power-law dependence. 

 

II- SCALING PROCEDURE 

 
The proposed scaling hypothesis leads to write the a -relaxation time or the viscosity in 

the following form8,3,

An  operational  way  to  determine  E¥ (r )  is  to  use  the  fact  that  most  glassforming 
liquids above some crossover temperature T*(r ) (called e.g. “onset temperature” in ref.9), an 

approximate  Arrhenius  T-dependence  of  the  relaxation  time  and  viscosity  is  observed 
(whereas super-Arrhenius behavior occurs below T*(r)).  E¥ (r ) then naturally identifies to the 
effective activation energy of the Arrhenius dependence : F

(X) goes to 1 below some value of 

the argument. One should stress at this point that no satisfactory theoretical explanation of the 

Arrhenius  activated  behavior  has  been  proposed  for  the  high-T  liquid  phase;  therefore,  we 

take  the  Arrhenius  form  as  a  convenient,  but  effective  description  which  physically  makes 
sense only if the empirical E¥ (r ) is several times the thermal energy T. 

The above procedure for determining E¥ (r ) is however inoperative in the case of most 

polymer melts for which high-T data in the Arrhenius regime are not available. One must then

resort  to  given  functional  forms  for  describing  the  r -dependence  of  E¥ (r ).  Simple  one-

parameter formulas are provided by a power law, E¥ (r )(cid:181)

x, and a linear behavior, E¥ (r ) (cid:181)

-

r *  (where  in  both  cases  a  r -independent  amplitude  factor  is  left  undetermined  and  is 

implicitly  included  in  the  definition  of  the  scaling  functions  Y

  and  F)

.  Better  descriptions 

could be achieved by adding more parameters: for instance, a quadratic term could be added 
to the linear form in order to describe, if necessary, a curvature in the shape of E¥ (r ). 

Data collapse on mastercurves, as predicted by Eq. (1), is illustrated in Fig.1a,b,c for 
different systems8,3,10: the binary Lennard-Jones model studied by simulation, for which E¥ (r ) 
had  been  previously  determined9,  the  organic  glassformer  o-terphenyl  and  a  polymer, 

polyvinylmethylether (PVME). We have also obtained a  good  data collapse  for other liquid 
models, molecular liquids and polymers. Work done by other groups11,12 confirms the validity 

of the scaling described by Eqs (1,2). 

 

III- CONSEQUENCES OF THE SCALING 

 
One of course hopes that more work will be undertaken to increase the (r, T) data base 

on  a  variety  of  glassformers  (with  a  variety  of  experimental  probes)  and  provide  additional 

checks  of  the  data  collapse  on  mastercurves,  but  taking  now  the  scaling  hypothesis  for 

reasonably well established one may explore its consequences. At a theoretical level, the most 

important  outcome  is that density  can  be  properly  scaled out and the viscous  slowing  down 

then described as a thermally activated  process.  In  particular, the  isochoric fragility, i.e, the 

measure of the degree of super-Arrhenius behavior at constant density, is independent of the 

density and can thus be taken as an intrinsic property of a given glassformer (which has led us 
to suggest a modification of the celebrated Angell plot10 as illustrated in Fig. 2). This can be 

seen by considering for instance the isochoric steepness index

The mere existence of the scaling formula, Eq.(1) (or Eq.(2)), also generates a number 

of  inter-relations  between  quantities  that  would  otherwise  be  independent.  For  instance,  the

where Tt (P) is the temperature at which t

a (P,Tt )=t . By using Eq.(7), it is easy to show 

that the isochoric and isobaric steepness indices are related through

The  above  equation  shows  immediately  that  even  if  the  isochoric  fragility  is 
independent of density, the isobaric one depends on pressure13 and that the isobaric fragility is 

always  larger  than  the  isochoric  one,  which  is  indeed  experimentally  observed;  as  seen  in 

Fig.2, this latter property leads to a spectrum of fragilities that is reduced in the isochoric case 

compared to  the isobaric  one. We display in  Fig.3  for the  glassforming  polymer PVME the 
t ׀ and of the product a PTg at the dielectric glass transition (Tg” Tt,  
evolution of the ratio a P/׀a

a =100sec)  as  a  function  of  the  pressure  Pg(T)  or  temperature  Tg(P).  Figure  3  illustrates 
t ׀  and  a PTg  are  roughly  proportional  (with  a  coefficient  x~2.8±0.2, 
several  points:  (i)  a P/׀a
t ׀ and a PTg are not constant but vary by about 
close to the value found in Fig.1) and (ii) a P/׀a

30%  over  the  available  pressure  range.  These  observations  are  valid  for  dielectric  and 

calorimetric (not shown here) data, however the coefficient x is different for the two sets. This

discrepancy  between  different  experimental  techniques  has  also  been  observed  for  glycerol 
when  comparing  dielectric  and  viscosity  measurements8,4.  It  does  not  contradict  the  scaling 
per se, but casts doubt on the universality of the temperature dependence of the a

 relaxation, 

at least in some materials and for some probes. 

 
Additional  “fragilities”  have  been  introduced  to  characterize  the  isothermal  behavior 
as  a  function  of  density  or  pressure14.  Although  we  are  reluctant  to  extend  the  concept  of 

“fragility”  to  such  cases,  it  remains  that  isothermal  steepness  indices  can  be  defined  along 

those lines (we use different notations to emphasize that one changes both the varying and the 

constant variables):

where k T is the isothermal compressibility. Again, using a simple power-law form for 
E¥ (r)  amounts to take dln(E¥ (r) )/dln(r)  as a species-specific constant (x). This little exercise 

shows  that  with  one  intrinsic  fragility,

,  the  r -dependence  of  the  energy  scale  E¥ (r) , 

( )ttttrrr rm

and thermodynamic input, one can retrieve all the various ratios and indices introduced in the 

literature to characterize the slowing down of relaxation and flow in glassforming liquids and 

polymers. 

Pushing further the consequences of the scaling behaviour, one may obtain constraints 

on  theoretically  motivated  or  simply  empirical  formulas  describing  the  evolution  with 
temperature of the a -relaxation time or the viscosity. For instance, if a description of t

, T) 

a (r

introduces  a  crossover  between  different  functional  forms  (e.g.,  a  crossover  between 
Arrhenius  and  super-Arrhenius  behavior  as  in  the  frustration-limited  domain  theory15),  the 
crossover  point  for  the  various  isochores,  say  T*(r) 3,16
a (T*(r) )=  constant,  and  its  r -dependence  is  simply  that  of  E¥ (r) .  Another  example  is

If the r -dependence of the prefactor t 0 is negligible and if A(r)  which is (up to a factor ln(2) 

in  the  original  version  or  a  similar  constant)  an  elementary  activation  energy  scales  as 
E¥ (r),  the  configurational  entropy  Sc(r

Finally, the existence of a scaling property may be useful for practical purposes such 

as:  organizing  the  data  collected  along  various  thermodynamic  paths  in  a  rational  way, 

predicting by extrapolation from a restricted data base and an estimated scaling function the 

behavior  in  a  wide  range  of  thermodynamic  parameters  (provided  an  accurate  equation  of 

state is available). Applied to the case of glassforming molecular liquids that easily crystallize 

under  pressure,  this  latter  procedure  could  allow,  by  combining  pressure  studies  at  high 
temperature,  which  give  access  to  the  effective  Arrhenius  activation  energy  E¥ (r),  and  a 

single isobaric measurement at atmospheric pressure over the whole temperature range down 

to the glass transition, to determine the glass transition line and more generally all isochronic 

lines in the whole density-temperature (or pressure-temperature) plane. 

IV- PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE SCALING 

 

 
We have already stressed that the proposed scaling hypothesis reduces the effect of the 
density  on  the  dynamics  to  the  variation  of  a  single  parameter  E¥ (r)  that  provides  the  bare 

scale  for  activation  barriers.  That  the  hypothesis  is  indeed  verified  (at  least  to  a  good 

approximation) in real and model glassformers is by no means trivial, because it implies that 

important  aspects  of  the  slowing  down  of  flow  and  relaxation,  such  as  fragility,  are 

independent  of  density.  Interestingly,  one  can  build  an  elementary  model  for  which  the 

validity  of  the  scaling  can  be  proven.  The  model  has  been  introduced  to  study  the  energy 
landscape of  a  simple  atomic liquid17. The  potential energy function of  the whole system is 

taken  as  the  sum  of  repulsive  soft-sphere  interactions  and  of  a  homogeneous,  mean-field 

attractive background. Specifically,

where N is the number of atoms and a>0.In the absence of the attractive term, the self-

similar  nature  of  the  repulsive  power-law  potential  leads  to  the  remarkable  property  that  a

uniform  rescaling  of  the  atomic  coordinates  does  not  modify  the  topology  of  the  potential 
energy landscape. This implies the well known result18 that both the thermodynamic and the 

(long-time) dynamic properties of soft-sphere model depend on density and temperature only 

via a single control parameter 

. Stated slightly differently, this means that a change 

= rrr r

nT

of density only changes the bare energy scale, which varies as r n/3. It is easy to see that adding 

a uniform attractive background does not alter the dynamical properties (which depend on the 

topology of the energy landscape and on activation barriers, i.e., on energy differences), but 

changes the thermodynamic behavior, albeit in a trivial way as illustrated by the equation of 

state which becomes

where  F  is  the  scaling  function  for  the  purely  repulsive  soft-sphere  model.  In  this 

example, Eq.(1) applies with E¥ (r )(cid:181)

n/3. 

Although  the  soft-sphere  model,  possibly  supplemented  by  a  mean-field  attractive 

background, has been used as a rationale for universally applying the scaling formula Eq.(1) 
with a power-law density dependence19, we think that the model is too much of a caricature of 

real molecular  and  polymeric glassformers to guarantee the  physical meaning  of the  power-
law exponents (called x here and in ref 10, g in ref 11, and n in ref 12 ). Arguments supporting 
our view can be summarized as follows (additional arguments are given in ref20 ): 

(1)  the  power  law  scaling  is  valid  for  spherically  symmetric  particles,  which  is 

obviously  not 

the  case  of  real  molecular  glassforming 

liquids;  decomposing 

the 

intermolecular  interactions  in  site-site  atomic-like  potentials  will  not  help  because  the 

intramolecular  constraints  will  destroy  the  simple  power-law  scaling.  The  presence  of 

directional interactions such as hydrogen bonding makes matter even worse. 

 

(2)  In  the  case  of  polymers,  it  is  clear  that  the  torsion  energy  barriers  hindering  the 

motion of the monomers introduce an intrinsic energy scale that cannot be accounted for by a 

power-law density dependence. 

 
(3) Some low values of the power law exponent obtained from scaling collapses (0.13 
in the case of sorbitol11) are meaningless in an interpretation in terms of soft spheres because 

it is not compatible with a proper thermodynamic limit (the repulsive energy when integrated 

over the whole volume diverges). 

(4) In the range of densities experimentally accessible, the variation of E¥ (r),  when it 
 
has  been  possible  to  extract  it  from  the  scaling  procedure3,  appears  monotonic  and  rather

featureless. As a result several simple functional forms can reproduce its behavior and lead to 
good  data  collapse.  We  have  already  mentioned  the  power-law  r x  and  the  affine  function 

(r
*)  which  in  many  cases  do  a  comparable  performance10.  The  affine  function  misses 
possible curvature effects21 which could be introduced at the expense of additional adjustable 

parameters.  However,  unless  a  much  wider  domain  of  densities  is  probed  and  a  strong 
variation of the energy scale E¥ (r)  observed, there are no compelling arguments for choosing 

one  specific  functional  form  and  no  particular  physical  meaning  to  be  associated  with  one 

form or another. 

 

As  an  additional  check  of  the  applicability  of  the  repulsive  soft-sphere  model  with 

mean-field  attractive  background,  we  have  studied  the  thermodynamics  of  several  systems. 

We have compared the best available equation of state to the prediction of the model, Eq.(14). 

More specifically, we  have used a and  x (i.e.,  x=n/3) as  adjustable  parameters  to  obtain the 
best data collapse of (P/r T+ar /T) as a function of r T-1/x. The resulting plots are illustrated in 
Fig.4  for  the  case  of  o-terphenyl  :  x=4  (found  in  the  scaling  fit  the  viscosity  data22)  is 

acceptable, but does not lead to the best collapse. Again, no compelling argument is found to 
justify  the  physical  interpretation  of  the  power  law  r x  with  x=4  (in  the  present  case,  no 

compelling argument is found against it either). 

V- CONCLUSION 

 

We  have  discussed  the  validity  and  the  consequences  of  the  scaling  hypothesis 
proposed  some  years  ago8,  according  to  which  the  influence  of  the  density  on  the  slowing 

down of flow and relaxation in glassforming liquids and polymers can be described trough a 
single parameter E¥ (r) . This latter represents a bare activation-energy scale characteristic of 

the  high-temperature  behavior  and  possibly  reflecting  the  minimal  cooperativity  of  the 
molecules with their first neighbors23. We have stressed that the mere  existence of a unique 
scaling variable E¥ (r) /T implies additional relations between a variety of dynamic quantities. 

Finally, we have discussed what we think to be the physical meaning of the scaling, namely 
the  existence  of  a  single  r -dependent  interaction  energy  scale  already  set  in  the  high-

temperature  liquid  (when  accessible)  and  cautioned  that  a  power-law  description  of  the 
density dependence of E¥ (r) , convenient as it may be, may not carry much physical content.

 Note that in a recent work Win and Menon (preprint cond-mat/ 0508648) claim that 
the  dynamics  in  glycerol  are  quantitatively  more  sensitive  to  fractional  changes  in  density 
(volume) than temperature. This finding, which seems completely orthogonal to what found 
earlier2,6, is due to the fact that the authors do not properly evaluate the relative contributions 
of density and temperature effects along an isobar. As a result they miss a large effect due to 
the isobaric coefficient of expansivity.

13  In  most  cases,  it  decreases  with  pressure.  However,  in  the  case  of  strongly  H-bonded 
liquids, such as glycerol, the ratio a P/׀a
t ׀, exceptionally high at the glass transition,  behaves 
in  the  opposite  direction  over  the  first  hundreds  of  MPa,  and  tends  to  increases  along  an 
isochrone as T increases6; the isobaric fragility behaves accordingly. This could be related to 
the strength of the H-bond network, whose contribution decreases as T increases.

23 This interpretation is supported by the rough correlation between the size of E¥ (r)  and the 
strength of the intermolecular bonding. One finds that E¥ (r)  is small for the binary Lennard-
Jones model, large for the H-bonded liquid Glycerol and intermediate for the organic liquid o-
terphenyl (see refs. 3 and 8).

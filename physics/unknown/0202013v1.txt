ABSTRACT 

As-rich  GaAs  (001)  surfaces  are  successfully  observed  during  As4-irradition  by  a 

system in which scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and molecular beam epitaxy can be 

performed simultaneously. With a substrate temperature of 440 oC and an As4 partial pressure 

of 2x10-6 torr, reflection high energy electron diffraction patterns and reflectance  anisotropy 

spectra  confirm  a  c(4x4)  As-stabilized  surface.  STM  images  clearly  show  alteration  of  the 

surface reconstructions while scanning. It is postulated that continual attachment / detachment 

of As molecules to and from the surface produces the observed dynamic behavior.

The  III-V  semiconductor  materials  exhibit  an  enormous  variety  of  surface 

reconstructions whose stability depends principally on temperature and group V overpressure 

or V:III flux ratio. For GaAs(001), growth by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) generally takes 

place  under  As-rich  conditions[1],  and  so  the  corresponding  As-stable  reconstructions  are 

particularly  important.  Of  these,  the  (2×4)  and  c(4×4)  reconstructions  have  been  widely 

studied[2,3]. Genuinely in situ surface sensitive probes, which can operate while the sample is 

growing 

in 

the  MBE  chamber, 

include  reflection  high-energy  electron  diffraction 

(RHEED)[4], total reflection angle X-ray spectroscopy (TRAXS)[5] and reflection anisotropy 

spectroscopy (RAS)[6]. However, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), well known for its 

utility in problems of surface structure and MBE growth, has generally been applied with the 

STM  remote  from  the  MBE  chamber[7-9].  In  the  case  of  As-rich  GaAs(001),  this  is 

potentially  problematic  since  it  is  thought  that  a  complex  exchange  of  As  molecules  to  and 

from the surface takes place during growth[9,10]. Performing STM measurements away from 

the MBE environment inevitably prevents such dynamics from being observed. In this paper 

we  report  on  the  first  observations  of  a  GaAs(001)-c(4×4)  surface  under  As4  irradiation  at 

elevated temperature, using an system in which both STM and MBE are incorporated in one 

chamber and can operate simultaneously[11,12]. 

Si-doped  GaAs(001)  1o off  <111>A  (n  =  2x1018 cm-3)  substrates  were  prepared  by 

 

 

 

 

 
standard  solvent  cleaning  and  etching  procedures,  and  then  loaded  into  the  MBE  chamber. 

After the oxide was removed  at  600  oC under  an As4 flux of 2x10-5 torr, an undoped GaAs 

buffer layer of 1.0 µm was grown at 580 oC with the following conditions: As4/Ga flux ratio 

~30,  growth  rate  1.0  µm/hour  and  background  pressure  of  2x10-7  torr.  This  resulted  in  a 

smooth GaAs surface with single bilayer steps. The samples were then kept at 440oC with As4 

partial  pressure  of  2x10-6  torr  in  order  to  produce  a  c(4x4)  phase  surface  as  determined  by 

reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and reflectance anisotropy spectra (RAS 

or  RDS),  shown  in  Fig.1.  While  maintaining  this  As4  overpressure,  STM  images  were 

obtained in constant current mode using sample biases of -3.0 V (filled states) and tunneling 

currents of 0.2 nA as shown in Fig.2. The STM images show steps, holes, and a few islands. 

During these sample conditions, no Ga flux and elevated temperature, there might be an initial 

adatom  flux  towards  the  steps,  resulting  in  a  very  low  concentration  of  the  islands 

imaged[13]. 

In is interesting to note that when the scanning speeds were lower than 1.0x104 nm/s, 

the  images  became  white,  indicating  an  apparent  constant  surface  height.  This  effect  is 

probably due to the limited lifetime of As4 on the surface. The adsorption lifetime of As4 is 

less than 10-5 s on GaAs(001) at 440  oC[14]. The vertical resolution of the STM image was 

better  than  0.3  nm,  as  judged  by  the  observation  of  the  surface  reconstruction.  With  scan 

speeds less than 104 nm/sec, the residence time of the tip over a 0.3 nm region is greater then 

10-5 s. Therefore, if the scan speed is slow desorptions, and possibly adsorptions, of As4 are 

likely as the tip is over an atomic site. This atomic motion results in very noisy images with 

an apparent constant height. However, if the scan speed was faster, so that the lifetime of As4 

was longer then the time it took the tip to travel over an atomic distance, the growth front of 

the  substrate  could  be  observed  as  shown  in  Fig.2.  This  scan  rate  dependent  process  is 

illustrated in Fig.3. This phenomenon was observed repeatedly and consistently, and does not 

occur in the absence of an incident As4 flux. 

 

 

Returning to the STM images of the GaAs surface, one immediately notices that the 

growth  front  was  disordered.  However,  by  RHEED  observations,  it  showed  a  clear  c(4x4) 

reconstruction,  as  shown  in  Fig.1,  both  before  and  after  STM  imaging.  But,  STM  images 

showed  no  reconstruction  on  the  surface.  One  reasonable  explanation  for  this  apparent 

contradiction  is that  there  is an additional  equilibrium  partial layer of mobile As molecules. 

This  layer  is  illustrated  in  Fig.3,  on  the  c(4x4)  surface  reconstruction[15,16].  In  order  to 

understand  the  nature  of  this  additional  adlayer,  we  mapped  the  surface  differences  by 

subtracting  two  sequential  images  acquired  one  second  apart.  This  timescale  is  short 

compared to complete transitions (about 100-1000s at 440  oC[17]) but much longer than the 

molecular  dynamics  timescale  discussed  in  the  previous  paragraph.  Therefore,  single 

adsorption/desorption events are likely to be observed. Shown in Fig 4 are two such images 

and their difference. The open circle marks the same location among these three images.  In 

the  adsorption  map  dark  regions  correspond  to  material  that  has  been  added  to  the  surface 

between scans. Figure 5 shows the same information only for a larger scan size. Clearly the 

adsorption of adatoms occurs not only at step edges, but also on flat terraces.   

In summary, we have use RHEED, RAS, and a system in which STM and MBE can be 

performed simultaneously, to examine the GaAs (001) surface with a substrate temperature of 

440  oC  and  an  As4  partial  pressure  of  2x10-6  torr.  We  find  that  STM  images  clearly  show 

alteration  of  the  surface  reconstructions  while  scanning  even  though  RHEED  patterns  and 

RAS spectra confirm a clear c(4x4) As-stabilized surface. It is postulated that detaching and 

attaching of As2 or As4 molecules may be the cause of the surface dynamics. In order to fully 

understand the dynamics of this phenomenon, further investigation is needed.

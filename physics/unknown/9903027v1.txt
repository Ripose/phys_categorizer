MATTER AND SPACE WITH TORSION

A. E. Karpelson

I.   Introduction

Our  objective  is  to  obtain  equations  of  the  unified  field  theory,  that  describe
distribution  and  motion  of  matter  or,  in  other  words,  curvature  and  torsion  of  4-
dimensional  space  of  the  affine  connection  with  metric,  and  to  solve  these  equations  for
some concrete cases.

We  proceed  on  the  basis  of  the  unified  field  theory  (developed  by  Einstein,
Eddington,  Weyl,  Schrodinger,  Heisenberg,  and  other  outstanding  physicists),  asserting
that all physical fields in nature are just the manifestations of some unified field. Following
Clifford, Cartan, Einstein, Wheeler, Ivanenko, and others, we assume that this unified field
is nothing else but the curved space-time with torsion [1-6].

Such  a  curved  and  torsional  4-dimensional  space-time  can  be  realized,  from  the
mathematical point of view, as space  U 4  of the affine connection with metric [1-7]. The
special cases of the space are used in the Einstein-Cartan theory [2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12], and
its structure is characterized e.g. by such geometrical parameters, as the affine connections

i and fundamental metric tensor  g ik  [2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 12].

II.   Field equations

We  want  to  derive  the  equations  describing  curvature  and  torsion  of  that  space-
time  and,  subsequently,  the  distribution  and  motion  of  matter.  The  most  natural  way  to
obtain these equations is to use the principle of least action [5, 14].

To do this, one should, first of all, choose the type of Lagrangian  L. We will use

the simplest Lagrangian

l  is the curvature tensor of space.

The possibility to use such a Lagrangian is disputed in many articles, however the
applied arguments often contradict each other [2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16]. In general, at the
time being, different authors discuss the advantages and drawbacks of Lagrangian (1) and
propose to use various novel more complex Lagrangians, however, each of them, in turn,
has new significant disadvantages. Einstein in [2] asserted, that more complex Lagrangians
should be analyzed only if there are some physical causes based on the experimental data.
There are no such causes, at present. So we will use the simplest and physically grounded
Lagrangian (1).

The field equations for U 4  space can be derived from the variational principle for

Thus, for  U 4  space, without presuming  a priori any correlation between  g ik   and

i) equations (4) connecting the geometrical characteristics of space.

Note that equations, similar to (4), were obtained in [2, 9, 16], where U 4  space of
the  affine  connection  with  metric,  and  the  non-symmetric  unified  field  theories,  were
discussed.

Equations  (3)-(4)  obtained  for  U 4   space  describe  the  curvature  and  torsion  of
space or, in accordance with our initial assumption, the distribution and motion of matter.
In  general  relativity  (GR)  theory  in  V4  space  we  have,  instead  of  (3)-(4),  the

Note,  that  GR  equations,  equations  of  the  Einstein-Cartan  theory  of  gravitation
with  torsion  [2,  4,  5,  8,  9,  15,  16]  and  equations  of  the  different  non-symmetric
topological gravitational theories [10-13] are dual. Their left-hand side is related only to
the space-time and the right-hand side is connected only with the matter. Equations (3)-(4)
do not possess such a dualism: they operate only with the geometrical parameters of  U 4
space, since they describe the distribution and motion of matter which by itself is just the
curvature and torsion of space-time.

As  a  concrete  application  of  the  results  obtained  one  can  name  the  violation  of
conditions of the Penrose theorem concerning the singularities in equations (3)-(4), unlike

Assumption  (9)  leading  to  solution  (10)  can  be  physically  explained  in  the
following way. The different sets of  G
i  correspond to the various degrees of space-time
curvature and torsion. Formulae (10) represent the simplest set of  G
i  found by the only
possible  way.  Any  other  set  of  G
i   which  is  not  related  to  condition  (9),  will  lead  to  a
more  complex  solution.  Thus,  solution  (10)  is  the  simplest  one  and  corresponds  to
minimum curvature and torsion of the space-time, that is the pure gravitational spherically
symmetric  stationary  field.  Any  other  field  (e.  g.  the  electromagnetic  field)  creates  a

gravitational  field  too.  It  means,  that  curvature  and  torsion  of  the  space-time  related  to
such a field, and the corresponding set of G

i , must be more complex.

A gravitational field is the only one among the different physical fields, which does
not lead to the appearance of some other fields. In this sense, it is the “simplest”  field, i.e.
it corresponds to the space-time with minimum curvature and torsion.

Using  expressions  (10),  one  can  find  Rik   and  R  by  formulae  (1)  and  substitute

them into (3). This yields

Equations  (11)  are  the  Schwarzschild  equations  for  the  centrally  symmetric  field

systems of equations are obtained for the pure gravitational spherically symmetric field.

Solution  (12)  corresponds  to  pure  gravitational  spherically  symmetric  stationary
field.  From  the  physical  point  of  view,  it  is  clear  that  such  a  field  can  exist  either  at  the
very large r  values, or the very small  r . In the first case, we have the extremely dispersed
matter  or,  in  other  words,  the  gravitational  waves  propagating  far  away  from  their
sources.  Subsequently,  the  space-time  for  such  waves  must  be  maximally  uniform  and
simple.  In  the  second  case,  we  obtain  the  extremely  compressed  matter,  i.e.  the  pure
gravitational ball (aggregate), inside which no other forms of matter exist. Moreover, no
transformations  and  inhomogeneities  should  occur  inside  such  a  ball.  Any  appearance  or
disappearance  of  some  other  fields  in  the  different  areas  of  the  ball  will  violate  the
spherical symmetry.

In the transitional case (at the medium values of  r ) a regular matter must exist –
i.e.  the  various  elementary  particles  and  fields.  Solution  (12)  is  not  valid  for  that
transitional  case.  Emphasize  that  in  order  to  answer  the  question  –  whether  or  not  the
gravitational ball appears, we should analyze just such a transitional case. Scenario of the
development  depends  on  the  mass,  energy,  temperature,  pressure,  and  other  physical
parameters  of  the  compressing  matter.  However,  to  find  the  appropriate  solution  of
equations  (7)-(8),  one  can  not  use  now  condition  (9),  which  is  valid  only  for  the  pure
gravitational field. Therefore, the transitional case for the spherically symmetric field will
be  described  by  very  complex  equations,  reduced  from  the  condition  related  to  matter
under consideration and equations (7)-(8).

To obtain a solution for the large  r  from (12), one can use the ordinary boundary
conditions:  the  Newton’s  expressions  for  metric  at  r =(cid:181)
  [14].  It  yields  a  solution
coinciding  with  the  Schwarzschild  one  for  the  spherically  symmetric  stationary  pure
gravitational field far away from its material sources

This match confirms the correctness of general formulae (12) and our idea that the
simplest solution of equations (4), that is set (10) of connections  G
i , is really related to
the simplest physical field (pure gravitational), i. e. to minimum curvature and torsion of
the space-time.

To obtain physically reasonable solution for the gravitational ball (i. e. for the small
r ) one should use formulae (12) and the boundary condition which exclude the singularity
of metric at  r = 0. Such a condition is natural for any closed physical theory. To satisfy it

This result corresponds to the well-known Galilean metric. It means, that inside the
extremely  compressed  gravitational  ball  (aggregate)  there  is  just  a  plane  space-time
without any curvature and torsion, although it was natural to expect that inside such a ball
the  space-time  should  be  maximally  curved  and  torsional.  It  can  be  explained  in  the
following way. In spherically symmetric field the density of matter and energy is inversely
related  to  radius  r   due  to  the  magnitude  of  an  internal  pressure.  It  means  that  when  r
decreases, this aggregate becomes more dense and uniform - e. g. plasma, nuclear matter,
and  neutron  matter.  At  this  stage,  the  permanent  “reconstruction”  of  the  space-time
occurs increasing the density, homogeneity and simplicity of a structure what is related to
the  energetic  and  thermodynamic  considerations.  At  last,  at  the  very  small  r   the  region
appears where simplicity and homogeneity achieve their maximum values. The space-time
in  this  area  is  absolutely  flat  and  possesses  the  Galilean  metric.  However,  such  a  plane
space-time  means  that  even  a  gravitational  field  is  not  present  in  this  area.  And  this  is
natural,  since  there  is  no  gravitational  field  in  the  center  of  any  spherically  symmetric
aggregate: attraction of the external regions leads to their mutual compensation.

Solution (14) obtained for U 4  space yields, unlike the GR equations valid in V4, no
singularity  in  the  spherically  symmetric  field,  in  other  words,  for  that  field  in  U 4   space
such disputable phenomena as the collapse and the black hole formation do not exist.

IV.   Uniform isotropic pure gravitational field

Now,  let  solve  equations  (3)-(4)  for  a  cosmological  problem  concerning  the
universe  evolution.  Analyzing  equations  for  the  uniform  isotropic  space  we  will  use  the
method described in [14]. Start with the closed isotropic model. For this model the non-
zero components of metric tensor in 4-dimensional spherical coordinates (

Such  a  solution  is  again  related  to  minimum  curvature  and  torsion  of  the  space-

time or, in other words, to the pure gravitational field in the uniform isotropic U 4 space.

Note  once  more,  that  the  different  sets  of  G

i   satisfying  (16),  correspond  to
various  degrees  of  the  space-time  curvature  and  torsion,  that  is  describe  the  different
physical fields. The simplest set (17) of  G

the “simplest”  physical field, i. e. the pure gravitational one.

Formulas  (19)  and  (20)  for  the  space  curvature  radius 

  are  valid  (as  we
explained  earlier)  only  for  the  pure  gravitational  field.  However  again  (as  for  the
spherically symmetric case), it is clear from the physical point of view, that such a field can
 (an extremely dispersed field or gravitational waves)
exist either for the very large 
or for the very small 

 (an extremely compressed field or gravitational aggregate).

For a transitional case, when the ordinary matter exists, solutions (19) and (20) are
not valid. At the same time, to determine what type of the cosmological model (closed or
open)  should  be  used,  we  have  to  investigate  just  this  transitional  case.  The  correct
scenario  of  its  development  will  depend  upon  the  mass,  energy  and  other  parameters  of
matter  under  examination.  However,  in  order  to  do  this,  we  must  solve  equations  (15)-
(16) without condition (9), since this condition is valid only for the pure gravitational field.
Therefore,  the  transitional  case  for  the  uniform  isotropic  field  will  be  described  by  very
complex equations, reduced from the condition related to the matter under consideration
and equations (15)-(16).

,

,
Analyzing (19) and (20) for very large  r a t

, we obtain that the space curvature
radius  a will infinitely increase with time for the open model and oscillate for the closed
one.  It  means,  that  (e.g.  for  the  open  model)  at  the  final  stage  of  its  development  the
universe or (which is more correct) the metagalaxy will infinitely expand and “straighten”,
as it should be for the uniform isotropic pure gravitational field.
,
tar
,

 (i. e. at the initial stage of the metagalaxy development)
for  both  models  we  obtain  the  pure  gravitational  aggregate  (with  the  Galilean  metric),
whose space curvature radius a grows up with time.

For the very small 

The Galilean metric inside the aggregate means that in this region the space-time is
plane, non-curved and non-torsional, i. e. even the pure gravitational field does not exist in
that  area.  Such  a  conclusion  is  physically  reasonable,  because  there  should  not  be  any
gravitational field inside the extremely compressed small uniform and isotropic aggregate,
since the external regions attraction leads to the mutual gravitational compensation. This is
an  initial  stage  of  the  metagalaxy  evolution,  and  it  can  be  named  e.g.  “the  start  of  an
expansion”  or  “the big bang”.

Emphasize, that analyzing either the spherically symmetric or the uniform isotropic
fields  in  U 4  space  for  the  very  small  r ,  we  obtained  the  similar  results:  an  extremely
compressed  pure  gravitational  aggregate,  inside  which  the  space-time  has  the  Galilean
metric.  This  conclusion  confirms  the  idea  [15]  that  at  t = 0  the  metagalaxy  and  the
collapsing star are identical, and that, in general, the process of collapse for the massive
gravitational systems is similar for a star, a nebula or a metagalaxy.

It is natural to assume that the metagalaxy, in turn, can be treated as the “closed”
region of some infinite and eternal Universe (or “Polycosmos”), which is the most general
formation  in  nature.  In  such  a  Universe  there  is  a  great  variety  of  different  forms  of  the
matter, i. e. the various types of curved and torsional space-time which permanently move,
interact  and  vary.  Certainly,  our  metagalaxy  is  not  an  exception;  there  are  an  unlimited
number  of  metagalaxies  in  the  Universe.  The  way  of  development  for  each  of  them
depends  on  its  dimension,  mass,  energy,  entropy  and  other  parameters,  and  also  on  the
interactions with other metagalaxies.

V. Spherically symmetric field of the Weyssenhoff massless fluid

8

In  section  III  we  solved  equations  (3)-(4)  for  the  simplest  spherically  symmetric
case using condition (9) and obtained a solution for the pure gravitational field. Now we
will  solve  these  equations  in  general  case  for  the  spherically  symmetric  field,  i.e.  for  the
material field.

Using (8), we find  Rik  and  R from (1), substitute them into (3)-(4) and obtain the

Four  first  equations  (21)  coincide  with  (11),  i.  e.  they  describe  the  spherically
symmetric  gravitational  field.  Six  last  equations  (21)  describe  the  spherically  symmetric
distribution of matter, which creates this gravitational field. To define what kind of matter
is described by six last equations (21), we should compare equations (3)-(4) in  U 4  space
with  classical  equations  (5)-(6)  containing  the  energy-momentum  tensor  Tik   of  matter  in
V4 space. In equations (3) any matter is described by the geometry (curvature and torsion)
of U 4  space of the affine connection with metric, as it should be in the unified geometrical
field  theory.  In  the  Einstein  equations  (5)  in  GR  any  matter  is  described  as  an  external
source in the Riemannian V4 space, which creates the curvature of this space-time, i.e. the
matter is described only by tensor  Tik  in the right-hand side of equations (5). If we know
what kind of matter is examined in  V4 space (i.e. tensor  Tik  components are known) and
what type of the geometry is related to it in  U 4  space (i.e. connections 
  are  known),
these  two  systems  of  equations  must  be  identical  because  both  give  just  different

Such  a  comparison  of  equations  (3)  and  (5)  is  the  only  method  which  allows  to
find the correlation between the geometry of U 4  space, that describes any kind of matter
in the unified field theory, and the real matter in GR theory. The field, in space U 4  of the

The  result  obtained  looks  reasonable  from  the  physical  point  of  view.  Only  the
massless particles can form the ideal spherically symmetric stationary continuous field with
metric (7). Such a field can not be created by some other particles, because it would mean
that  this  field  consists  of  local  inhomogeneities  and,  subsequently,  such  a  space  would
have the “nodal”  structure and could not be the spherically symmetric continuous medium,
as it should be. Any field consisting of the particles with mass will have the local spatial
structure and due to this will break the spherical symmetry.

Thus,  the  spherically  symmetric  distribution  of  matter,  which  in  U 4   space  is
described by equations (21), can be represented only by the massless ideal fluid with spin
(the massless Weyssenhoff fluid). Solution of this system of equations can be obtained in

the  following  way.  Using  first  three  equations  in  (21)  we  can  find  functions

formulae (12), (7) and (8). These expressions determine almost all the geometrical objects

Equations  (22)  were  obtained  from  system  (21)  and  equations  (5)-(6)  for  the
massless  Weyssenhoff  fluid  whose  anti-symmetric  energy-momentum  tensor  has  only  six
non-zero  components 
.  Using  the  identity  condition

between  equations  (3)  in  U 4   space  and  equations  (5)  in  V4  space,  we  equalize  the  left-
hand  sides  of  three  last  equations  (21)  and  the  right-hand  sides  of  equations  (5).  As  a
result,  we  can  determine  from  (12),  (7),  (8)  and  (22)  the  geometry  of  U 4   space  for  the
spherically symmetric field of the Weyssenhoff massless fluid. It means that, if we know in

four connections G

VI.   Uniform isotropic field of the Weyssenhoff massless fluid

In  section  IV,  using  condition  (9),  we  solved  equations  (3)-(4)  for  the  simplest
uniform isotropic case and obtained a solution for the pure gravitational field. However,
we  can  solve  these  equations  in  general  case  for  the  uniform  isotropic  field,  i.e.  for  the
material field.

Two first equations from (23) coincide with equations (18), i.e. they describe the
uniform  isotropic  pure  gravitational  field.  Six  last  equations  from  (23)  describe  the
uniform isotropic distribution of matter, which creates this gravitational field.

To define what kind of matter is described by these six equations one should apply
again (as in section V) the identity condition between equations (3)-(4) in U 4   space  and

VII.   About quantization of general equations (3)-(4)

At the first sight, it seems that in order to quantize equations (3)-(4) we can apply
one of the methods typically used to quantize an ordinary gravitational field [6, 15, 16]. As
a result, we could obtain from equations (3)-(4), describing curvature and torsion of the
space-time  (or  the  distribution  and  motion  of  matter),  the  quantum  equations  for  “the
primary  building  blocks  of  everything”,  i.e.  for  some  “basic  particles”  that  form  all  the
existing  elementary  particles.  Such  a  “basic  particle”  can  be  represented  as  the  local
curvature and torsion of the space-time.

However firstly, at the time being, there is no rigorous and well-grounded method
for  the  gravitational  field  quantization.  Secondly  (and  that  is  the  main  point),  it  is  not
necessarily to quantize equations (3)-(4).

The  point  is  that,  if  we  could  quantize  equations  (3)-(4),  we  would  obtain  the
equations for the wave functions and operators of the “basic particles”. However, such a
description assumes the probabilistic character of the “basic particles”.

In quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics the probabilistic behavior of
any particle can be explained by the impossibility to take into account the various forces
between  this  specified  particle  and  all  the  other  particles.  It  is  obvious,  that  such
interactions  occur  and  that,  unlike  the  macro-objects,  they  are  significant  for  any  micro-
particle. However, the exact calculation of these phenomena is impossible.

The  situation  with  the  “basic  particles”  is  absolutely  different.  Their  equations,
describing  in  the  most  general  way  the  curvature  and  torsion  of  U 4   space  (or  the
distribution  and  motion  of  matter)  must  include  all  the  possible  interactions  among  such
particles.  Nothing  should  be  beyond  the  scope  of  that  approach.  This  is  the  physical
meaning of equations (3)-(4) or their quantum counterparts. It means, there should not be
any uncertainty in the behavior of “the basic particles”, however such an uncertainty will
surely be present in the quantized equations.

This  conflict  can  be  easily  overcome  if  we,  in  principle,  refuse  to  quantize

equations (3)-(4).

Such reasoning confirms the ideas of Einstein, Wheeler and others [2, 3], that only
the  deterministic  classical  model,  but  not  the  quantum  probabilistic  one,  should  describe
the physical field. Different authors [3, 6, 15, 16] expressed the similar ideas concerning
the principal classical character of, at least, the gravitational field.

VIII.   Conclusions

In sections II-VII we analyzed the different aspects of the unified geometrical field
theory  in  space  U 4   of  the  affine  connection  with  metric.  The  main  results  can  be
formulated as follows
1.  The  various  kinds  of  curvature  and  torsion  in  U 4   space  are  related  to  the  different
physical  fields.  Expressions  (3)-(4)  are  the  general  equations  of  that  unified
geometrical field theory. The idea confirms the hypothesis [2, 3, 6], that “physics is the
pure geometry”.

2.  The simplest set of affine connections  G

i  describes minimal curvature and torsion of
jk
the space-time or, in other words, the “simplest”  physical field - the pure gravitational
one.  More  complex  sets  of  G
i   represent  the  more  complex  geometry  of  the  space-
jk
time and therefore describe the more complex material physical fields.

3.  In the spherically symmetric and uniform isotropic models the solutions were obtained

for the pure gravitational field and the Weyssenhoff massless fluid.

4.  For  both  models  (the  spherically  symmetric  and  the  uniform  isotropic)  a  pure

gravitational field can exist either at the very large or the very small distances.

13

5.  Inside  the  extremely  compressed  spherically  symmetric  pure  gravitational  ball  the
space-time is plane and has the Galilean metric. There is neither the collapse, nor the
black hole in such a field.

6.  At  the  initial  stage  of  its  development  the  metagalaxy  had  a  form  of  the  extremely

compressed pure gravitational aggregate with the Galilean metric of space-time.

7.  There  is  no  necessity  to  quantize  equations  (3)-(4).  They  describe  the  evolution  of
matter in the most general form, indicating that any physical field (i.e. the curved and
torsional space-time) is a deterministic system.

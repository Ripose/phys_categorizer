The clearing up of a wave nature of the energy and mass transfer phenomena in clas-
sical  expressions  of  the  molecular-kinetic  theory  has  allowed  to  find  a  quantitative 
measure of intensity of processes of a thermal conductivity, viscosity and diffusion 
in conditions of a thermally nonequilibrium and heterogeneous composition contin-
uum.  It  is  rotined,  that  the  appearance  of  a  temperature  drop  in  fluid  stipulates  the 
appearance of the continuum stratification and formation of the flowing "bodies" in-
teracting among  themselves.  It is  rotined,  that the known expressions for a thermal 
conductivity, viscosity, diffusion and heat convection had been obtained for a ther-
mally equilibrium and homogeneous continuum and produce a maximum quantity of 
intensity of the transfer processes. The introduced expression is usable for a quantita-
tive estimation of intensity of the transfer processes in fluid and its streams in condi-
tions  of  the  non-stationary  heat  exchange  in  natural  conditions  and  technical  prob-
lems.

Introduction 
 
The kinetic theory of gases is the most developed and oldest discipline of the molecular-kinetic 
theory of matter. To middle of the XX century, the basic laws of the energy and mass transfer 
phenomena in the gas medium were ascertained within the framework of this theory. For ascer-
tainment of these laws, it was accepted, that the gas medium is homogeneous, continuous, is in 
stationary  state  of  dynamic  balance,  appropriate  for  Maxwell's  function  of  the  distribution  of 
molecules  by  velocities  of  its  motion.  The  detected  experimentally  dependence  of  the  transfer 
phenomena on temperature was taken into account by Suzerland's formula defining dependence 
of  a  free  length  of  the  gas  atoms  (molecules)  on  its  temperature  [1].  At  the  same  time,  it  was 
recognized that «…the theory though and correctly reflects a progress of processes but one is not 
realistic in the numerical data» [2]. The results of the careful experiments of the gas stream mov-
ing with the heat exchange in the pipe [3, 4] testifies that the greater is the temperature differ-
ence between the pipe wall and flow, the less is quantity of the heat transfer and hydraulic fric-
tion  coefficients.  About  the  offered  empirical  methods,  taking  into  account  of  the  above-
mentioned appearances, the authors [5] testify themselves that its applying «can reduce to incor-
rect calculation.» If to this to add such problems: why the flame tongue is localized in an atmos-
phere,  why  the  atmospheric  and  ocean  currents  are  localized  in  the  jet  streams  and  ones  are 
moved at huge distances and all that, so the unsatisfactory state of the question of quantitative 
estimation of intensity of the transfer phenomena in fluid will be detected in full measure.

Approach 
 
Let's  consider  a  following  situation:  two  gas  mediums,  reposing  in  a  zero  gravity  of  identical 
composition under identical pressure but having different temperature, are entered contacts. Let's 
call one of these mediums "hot" and the other "cold". The distribution of molecules on its motion 
velocities  in  each  of  the  viewed  mediums  matches  to  Maxwellian  function.  According  to  this 
law, the hot gas medium contains a few molecules having velocity equal to the average velocity 
of molecules of the cold gas medium. And vice versa, the cold gas medium contains a few mole-
cules having velocity equal to the average velocity of molecules of the hot gas medium. But the 
average velocity of molecules of the hot gas medium is much more of the average velocity of the 
cold gas medium. At the moderate value of pressure and temperature, the number of the colli-
sions of one molecule with the adjoined molecules for both mediums is equally though density 
of hot medium is much less than density of cold medium. The last combination implies, that on 
boundary of contact of the considered mediums each molecule of hot medium sequentially col-
lides with several molecules of cold medium. Such boundary interaction essentially differs from 
interaction of molecules inside each of the considered mediums. Maxwellian distribution, as the 
most probable, means a uniform distribution of molecules on its velocities in space of this or that 
gas medium. Thus the motion of molecules in medium has the penetrating (diffusion) nature. On 
the other hand, the correspondence of the internal energy (oscillation) of molecules to the kinetic 
energy of its translational motion is property of dynamic self-stabilization of the initial state of 
each of the considered mediums. The last property is similarly to the first mechanics principle in 
certain degree and one can be expressed so: every molecular-kinetic medium maintains the equi-
librium according Maxwell’s state in absence of external actions. 

In contrast to the penetrating interaction of molecules inside each of the contacting gas mediums, 
the contact interaction of these mediums has a reflective nature to the certain extent. At the same 
time  intensity  of  the  transfer  processes  of  the  thermal  and  mechanical  energy  and  also  of  the 
mass (diffusion) is descended depending on increasing of the temperature drop between contact-
ing mediums. 

Taking into account on elastic character of interaction of molecules with each others both inside 
of the gas medium and on boundary with other medium, it is expedient to suppose that the trans-
fer phenomena of energy and mass through the boundary of the gas mediums have the wave na-
ture.  From  this  position,  we  shall  consider  expressions,  known  in  the  molecular-kinetic  theory 
for:

If  both  parts  of  expression  for  diffusion  to  multiply  on ρ,  then  all  three  these  expressions  will 
have identical dimensionality of specific stream (fluence) of energy. At the same time, all three 
these expressions will contain a product  ρ⋅c
, which one characterizes the wave impedance of 
the medium. That is, the wave nature of the transfer phenomena in the gas medium is embodied 
in the formulas of the molecular-kinetic theory, despite of its appreciably statistical nature.

Solution 
 
According to the wave approach [6] on the boundary surface of two mediums having the differ-
ent wave impedance, the waves of energy out of medium with the high wave impedance are re-
flected partially or totally from the contact boundary of mediums, and fractionally transits into 
medium with the smaller wave impedance. Thus the condition of the continuity of mediums on 
boundary of its partition is remained. 

The expression for the reflection coefficient of the energy flow on a boundary of mediums with 
the different wave impedance has well-known view: 

where 

z

⋅= ρ  - wave impedance of the medium, c – sound velocity.

ent wave impedance:

As applied to the gas mediums the conductivity coefficient represents the quantitative perform-
ance of degree of depression (diminution) of intensity of the transfer phenomena in molecular-
kinetic medium. 

So, for the contacting gas mediums of different composition under the different temperature and 
the same pressure, it is rightly the expression:

tween the gas stream and the pipe wall both at heating and at cooling of stream in the form:

Comparison of results of calculation with results of known experiments [3, 4] testify that the ex-
pression (1) correctly and precisely enough plays back the results of experiments. Thus the ex-
pression (1) was utilised in two simplified modifications:

where Tf, Tw – the temperature is average on section of stream and the temperature of the pipe 
wall accordingly. 

It is necessary to note that for the equilibrium conditions, when the temperature drop in medium 
is absent, the boundary conductivity coefficient Kbc becomes equal to unity. It match to experi-
mental data [3, 4] and testify that the Nusselt's number usually used is deduced for the equilib-
rium conditions when the heat exchange is absent.  
Similarly to this and the classic expressions of the molecular-kinetic theory for transfer of ther-
mal and mechanical energy and the mass (diffusion) are deduced for the equilibrium conditions 
when there is absent the temperature drop in the considered medium. Generally when there is the 
temperature drop in molecular-kinetic medium, there are boundaries in it on which one the inten-
sity of processes of transfer is descended. For these conditions, the classical expressions become:

Thus, the intensity of all processes of transfer is descended in the equal number of times under 
action of the temperature drop. In this connection it is necessary to distinguish conductivity in 
the  thermally  equilibrium  molecular-kinetic  continuum  at  given  temperature  that  can  be  esti-
mated by means of classical expressions, and alongside with it, it is necessary to distinguish the 
boundary conductivity when in indicated medium, the boundaries are arisen under action of the 
temperature  drop,  dividing  the  continuum  on  the  fluid  "bodies".  The  intensity  of  the  boundary 
transfer is determined by expressions (5, 6, 7). 

The uniformity of change of intensity of the transfer processes under the thermally nonequilib-
rium conditions returns us to the consideration of the gas stream motion in pipe. This is inter-
linked with that at the heat exchange (of stream with the pipe wall), the hydraulic friction coeffi-
cient  is  necessary  to  multiply  on  the  conductivity  coefficient  just  as  the  heat  exchange  coeffi-
cient. In this case only, results of well-known experiments [5], in which one the lowering of the 
heat  exchange  intensity  as  contrasted  to  result  of  calculation  was  accompanied  simultaneously 
by the lowering of the hydraulic friction coefficient, will be clear. 
 
Discussion of results 
 
The wave character of the contact interaction of solid bodies and distribution in its of mechanical 
energy is well learnt at present time [7]. The mechanics of the contact interaction implies pres-
ence  of  bodies  entering  the  contact  interaction  among  themselves.  As  against  it,  the  fluid  pos-
sessing ability to conduct the mechanical energy in the form of elastic waves as well as the solid 
body, itself is capable to be structured on the bodies interacting among themselves. This property 
of fluid is consequence that it has the greater number of degrees of freedom as contrasted to solid 
body. The reasons of the self-structurization of a gas and liquid continuum into the flowing bod-
ies  are  spatial  heterogeneity  of  composition  and  the  thermal  non-equilibrium  of  continuum.  In 
oceanology and meteorology, for example, these reasons explain an existence of the underwater 
and atmospheric sound channels owing to the boundary refraction. The wave approach offered in 
this work allows to ascertain not only this phenomenon but also a reason of existence of the cur-
rents in hydrosphere and atmosphere. The sharp decrease of intensity of the transfer processes of 
energy and matter on boundary of heterogeneous composition and thermal non-equilibrium leads 
to the stratification of the water and air continuum. The flowing bodies nascent in the result of

structuring of continuum are propelled in the form of the jet flows under action of the gravitation 
forces and the pressure drops. Owing to a sharp decrease of intensity of the boundary processes 
of  the  energy  and  mass  transfer,  the  warm  and  cold  currents  in  oceans  and  atmosphere  have 
global time-space nature. It is observed also the light refraction on these boundaries. 

In multiplicity of the technical realizations, it is possible to cite an example illustrating the op-
erational  efficiency  of  the  two-stroke  internal  combustion  engine.  The  distinction  of  this  type 
engine  from  the  four-cycle  engine  implies  that  the  processes  of  the  exhaust  of  the  combustion 
products and filling of the combustion chamber by the fresh air-fuel mixture are combined in the 
united  blowing  process.  The  fresh  air-fuel  mixture  entering  the  combustion  chamber  under  an 
overpressure should expel the combustion products and should not mix up with its. The experi-
ence displays that the intermixing of these gas mediums practically does not happen. The fresh 
air-fuel  mixture  expels  the  combustion  products  similarly  to  the  piston  out  of  the  combustion 
chamber.  

Strange as it may seem, the basic reason of this phenomenon is only that the temperature of the 
combustion products is much higher than temperature of the combustion chamber walls, and also 
of the fresh air-fuel mixture. At first, this sole cause practically prevents intermixing of the con-
cerned gas mediums. Secondly, It appreciably depreciates a viscosity of the combustion products 
on the contact boundary with the air-fuel mixture and walls of the combustion chamber and si-
multaneously  fortifies  an  integrity  of  medium  of  the  combustion  products,  owing  to  the  high 
continual viscosity. The combination of the listed features of the blowing process stipulates the 
slip out of the combustion products out of the combustion chamber under action of pressure of 
the arriving air-fuel mixture to the cylinder without essential intermixing of these gas mediums. 

The  phenomenon  of  the  continuum  stratification  of  fluid  (gas,  liquid)  comes  into  being  as  the 
consequence of the thermal non-equilibrium is general at the natural and technical processes.

Understanding how growth induces form is a longstanding biological question

.

Many studies concentrated on the shapes of plant cells

, fungi

 or bacteria

. Some

2

3

3-5

others have shown the importance of the mechanical properties of bacterial walls

and plant tissues

in pattern formation. Here I sketch a simple physical picture of

6 

cell growth. The study is focussed on isolated cells that have walls. They are

1-6

5

modeled  as  thin  elastic  shells  containing  a  liquid, which pressure drives  the  growth

as generally admitted for bacteria

 or plant cells

. Requiring mechanical

4

7

equilibrium  leads  to  estimations  of  typical  cell  sizes,  in  quantitative  agreement  with

compiled data

 including bacteria, cochlear outer hair, fungi, yeast, root hair and

8-27

giant  alga  cells.

The starting point is a crude physical description of a cell (fig. 1a). A liquid (the

cytoplasm) is contained in a thin elastic shell (the cell wall). The physical parameters

involved are the cell radius of curvature R, the wall thickness h, the elastic modulus of the

wall material E and the pressure P exerted on the wall (or the turgor pressure). P is the

difference between pressures inside and outside the cell. In this Letter, I derive scaling laws

relating these parameters and test them with experimental data.

The analysis relies on the following remarks. The turgor pressure and the thickness

of the wall are mainly regulated by the cell physiology. Wall growth is similar to plastic

2

deformations as established for plant cells

: The wall behaves as an elastic material below a

critical strain ay and grows above by yielding to stress. So, the wall is modeled as a

perfectly plastic material

, which yields in extension and not in compression (see fig. 1b).

28

The cell can also regulate the wall plasticity

. I assume that the wall has no intrisic (natural)

curvature when it is formed. Finally, the growth is slow: The characteristic time for growth

is much larger than the time needed to reach mechanical equilibrium. Consequently, the cell

7

7

is considered to be at mechanical equilibrium.

I first estimate the cell mechanical energy, which is minimal at equilibrium. A thin

shell has two modes of deformation: Stretching and bending

. The stretching energy is

29

proportional to the strain squared, but if the material undergoes plastic deformations (see

fig. 1b), then energy is stored only below the yield strain ay, so the stretching energy (per

unit surface) scales as Es~Ehay

. The elastic energy (per unit surface) for bending is

2

proportional to the square of the mean curvature, Eb~Eh

/R

. In bending, the outside half of

3

2

the wall (with respect to the center of curvature) is elongated while the inside half is

compressed. When plastic flow occurs, it is restricted to the outside of the wall, because the

material is considered to yield only in extension (fig 1b). In this case the effective thickness

is reduced in the bending energy by factor of about 2: Its order of magnitude remains the

same. The potential energy (per unit surface) corresponding to the turgor pressure is

proportional to the volume/area ratio, Et~PR.

The yield strain for most materials is smaller than of 10

, while h/R for most cells

-2

varies between 10

 and 10

. So, it is reasonable to consider the limiting case when ay<<h/R,

-2

-1

so that Es<<Eb. In this case, a characteristic size for cell sizes results from the balance

3

between bending and pressure (Eb~Et),

R=ah(E/P)

. (1)

1/3

A simple calculation assuming that the wall adopts locally the shape of a sphere of radius R

and using the equation for the bending of thin plates

 gives a~1.3 (the exact value depends

29

on the Poisson ratio of the material). The best fit to the compiled experimental data (fig. 2b)

gives a=4.0, of the same order of magnitude. The agreement is good, although I have

neglected the anisotropy of the wall, which is probably important in pattern generation.

One might notice a departure from the law (1) at small radii in fig. 2. This motivates

the study of the opposite limit ay>>h/R for bacteria and cochlear hair cells. Indeed,

experiments by Koch (see ref. 5) have shown that the typical strain for bacillus subtilis is

ay=0.45. In this limit, stretching balances the turgor pressure. The longitudinal tension for a

cylindrical shell

 is T=PR/2. If the wall yields then T=Ehay (using fact that the Poisson

5, 29

ratio is small for a strongly anisotropic polymer as peptidoglycan

). So the cell typical

5

radius is

R=bh (E/P).

(2)

Here b=2 ay~0.9, in agreement with b=1.0 obtained from the fit to the experimental data

(fig. 2b). Here I have implicitly assumed that the yield strain ay varies very little for this

class of cells. I have neglected the possible electric charges, which could be important in the

wall shape

. The elastic tension Ehay is probably the origin of the tension used in the

5

Surface Stress Theory

 to describe the shape of bacteria.

To summarize, a preferred radius of curvature for growing cells has been determined

from the balance between the turgor and elastic forces (bending or stretching depending on

the wall yielding properties). A possible physical picture is that isolated cells grow more or

less spherically until this preferred radius is reached. Then they adopt a cylindrical shape to

keep this radius. This remark could account for the widespread existence of isolated

elongated cells: root hairs, pollen tubes, fungal hyphae, alga cells(cid:201) One can also notice that

the scaling laws (eqs. 1-2) roughly correspond to tip growing cells and cells undergoing

diffuse growth respectively. The present results could motivate (and would need) new

measurements of the elastic properties of cell walls. They would be the basis for a

quantitative theory for cell growth.

Methods

The wall elastic modulus E, the turgor P, the cell radius R (the radius of the cylindrical part

for elongated cells) and the wall thickness h were collected as described in the following.

The two lengths were either measured from the published photographs or taken from the

references. When some data were missing in the literature, they were replaced by data from

similar species as indicated below. Chara corallina

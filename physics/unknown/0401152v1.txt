Introduction:  Many  asteroids  show  visual  evi-
dence of cratering with the apparent size of the cra-
ters  revealing  a  large  range  of  impactor  size  [1-3].
Studies  primarily  concentrating  on  disruption  or
fragmentation of the asteroid [4] or investigating sta-
ble  orbits  for  both  uncharged  particles  orbiting  the
asteroid [5,6] and charged particles levitated by elec-
trostatic  means  from  the  asteroid s  surface  [7]  have
been  conducted.  However,  even  during  non-
catastrophic  impacts,  ejecta  of  many  different  sizes
will be produced. Of particular interest are the larger
dust  particles  (from  1  µm  to  1000  µm  in  radius)
which  suffer  one  of  three  possible  fates.  First,  they
can be re-accreted by the asteroid. Secondly, they can
enter into orbit around the asteroid. Finally, they can
escape  the  gravitational  pull  of  the  asteroid  alto-
gether. The second scenario is of greatest interest to
planners of asteroid rendezvous spacecraft, as space-
craft (and their payload instruments) are susceptible
to damage during encounters with such dust [8]. Ad-
ditionally,  for  maximum  efficiency  dust  detection
systems  must  be  specifically  configured  for  a  par-
ticular  size  and  speed  distribution  of  the  dust.  Al-
though  dust  particles  have  not  yet  been  directly  ob-
served  around  asteroids,  in-situ  data  are  extremely
limited  since  only  one  such  environment  has  been
investigated  at  close  range  [3].  This  study  concen-
trates on the question of whether dust ejecta can enter
into stable orbits around an asteroid and if so the size
and speed distribution of such dust.

Model:  It  will  be  assumed  that  an  impact  on  an
asteroid  will  eject  dust  particles  in  much  the  same
manner as previously observed for the moons of Ju-
piter  and  Earth  [9].  After  ejection,  the  orbital  pa-
rameters for each grain are calculated taking into ac-
count  the  asteroid s  gravitational  force,  the  solar  ra-
diation  pressure  force,  the  solar  gravitational  force,
and the interaction of the dust particle with the Solar
magnetic field as given in Eq. (1) below.

In  Eq. (1), the first and fourth terms deal with the
gravitational acceleration due to the asteroid and Sun
respectively  where  G  is  the  gravitational  constant,

MA is the mass of the asteroid, r is the distance from
the center of the asteroid to the position of the parti-
cle,  ˆr  is the unit vector from the asteroid to the parti-
cle,  MSun  is  the  mass  of  the  Sun,  R  is  the  distance
from the Sun to the particle, and  ˆR  is the unit vector
from the Sun to the dust particle. In the last term, ρ is
the distance and  ˆρ  is the unit vector from the Sun to
the asteroid [10].

The second term describes the radiation pressure
force due to the solar radiation incident upon the par-
ticle with β defined as the ratio of the solar radiation
pressure force to the solar gravitational force [11].  β
is calculated using

where Q is the radiation pressure efficiency (taken to
be 1.0 for particles with radii larger than 1 µm), a is
the radius of the dust particle, and  ρ
d is its density.
The third term in equation (1) takes into account the
interaction of the magnetic field on a charged particle
r
where φ is  the  potential  of  the  grain, 
B  is  the  solar
r
magnetic  field,      
v  is  the  velocity  of  the  dust  grain
ε
relative to the magnetic field and   
o is the permittiv-
ity of free space. Recent studies by Kimura and Mann
[12] indicate that particles exposed to a solar system
environment  outside  of  1  AU  will  be  charged  to  a
potential  of  —3.0  V.  Since  asteroids  do  not  provide
significant  protection  from  the  interplanetary  envi-
ronment,  this  potential  is  assumed  for  all  the  dust
particles examined in this study.

The  asteroid  Ceres  was  chosen  since  its  mass
makes it more likely to confine particles to a stable
orbit, and its almost spherical shape reduces the com-
plexity of the simulation. The dust was ejected from a
randomly  chosen  point  on  the  surface  of  Ceres  in  a
direction  parallel  to  the  surface  and  with  speeds
ranging from 300 to 600 m/s. This distribution corre-
sponds with experimental hypervelocity impact data
showing that such ejecta are created during low im-
pact  velocities  [13].  A  total  of  100  particles  were
launched at each speed with β values between 0.001
and 0.1 and a step size of 0.001. This β regime corre-
sponds to particle sizes of 220 µm to 2.2 µm respec-
tively,  assuming  the  density  of  the  dust  to  be  2.4
g/cm3, which is the bulk density of Ceres [14].

Results:  After  ejection,  dust  particle  orbits  were
tracked  for  one  year.  Dust  particles  with  ejection
speeds  between  430  and  580  m/s  entered  into  orbit
around Ceres. The asteroid accreted grains with ejec-
tion  speeds  less  than  430  m/s,  while  particles  with
ejection speeds greater than 580 m/s escaped its

tionally, all particles ejected at angles less than 85¡ to
the  surface  normal  were  removed  from  the  system
within a month. Particles entering into long term or-
bits  (i.e.  lasting  the  full  year  of  the  simulation)  re-
mained  within  14  Ceres  radii  as  illustrated  by  the
semi-major axis distribution in Fig. 1. Almost 90% of
the particles remained within four Ceres radii of the
asteroid. Figure 2 shows the eccentricity as a function
of particle size (β value) at one year after ejection. It
is interesting to note that the minimum eccentricity is
for  particles  with  a  β  value  approximately  equal  to
0.013 and not the smallest dust particles as would be
expected. Figure 3 illustrates the final positions of the
dust one year after ejection and when looking down
on  the  orbital  plane  of  Ceres  (the  x-y  plane).  The
particles  are  centered  in  a  plane  (from  upper  left  to
lower right) with the solar direction as indicated.

Conclusions:  Of  the  primary  simulations  exam-

430 m/s and 580 m/s) only 359 particles survived out
of the 1600 ejected. All particles smaller than 7.0 µm
were removed from the system by the end of one year
with 64% of the particles larger than 7.0 µm in radius
accreted  by  Ceres.  The  orbital  speeds  for  the  re-
maining  particles  varied  from  almost  400  m/s  for
particles  with  semi-major  axes  just  over  one  Ceres
radii  to  less  than  100  m/s  for  particles  at  14  Ceres
Radii. These speeds were size independent and varied
primarily  with  distance  from  Ceres.  Such  relatively
low speeds even when coupled with the orbital speed
of a spacecraft (from 100 to 400 m/s, depending on
distance  from  Ceres)  should  not  pose  a  significant
hazard  except  for  spacecraft  in  retrograde  orbits  as
compared to the dust grain orbits [15]. The particles
were  centered  on  a  plane  in  a  torus  structure;  how-
ever, this was likely due to the single ejection point.
No ring-like structures were produced within the one
year  time  frame  of  the  simulation.  Simulations  ex-
tending beyond one year in duration are currently in
progress.

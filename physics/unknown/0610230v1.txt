Optical  microscopy  is  an  invaluable  tool  for  studies  of  materials  and  biological 
entities. With the current progress in nanotechnology and microbiology imaging tools 
with ever increasing spatial resolution are required. However, the spatial resolution of 
the conventional microscopy is limited by the diffraction of light waves to a value of 
the order of 200 nm. Thus, viruses, proteins, DNA molecules and many other samples 
are  impossible  to  visualize  using  a  regular  microscope.  The  new  ways  to  overcome 
this limitation may be based on the concept of superlens introduced by J. Pendry [1]. 
This concept relies on the use of materials which have negative refractive index in the 
visible  frequency  range.  Even  though  superlens  imaging  has  been  demonstrated  in 
recent experiments [2], this technique is still limited by the fact that magnification of 
the planar superlens is equal to 1.  
 
In  this  communication  we  introduce  a  new  design  of  the  magnifying  superlens  and 
demonstrate  it  in  the  experiment.  Our  design  has  some  common  features  with  the 
recently  proposed  “optical  hyperlens”  [3],  “metamaterial  crystal  lens”  [4],  and  the 
plasmon-assisted  microscopy technique [5].  The internal structure of the magnifying 
superlens  is  shown  in  Fig.1(a).  It  consists  of  the  concentric  rings  of  polymethyl 
methacrylate  (PMMA)  deposited  on  the  gold  film  surface.  Due  to  periodicity  of  the 
structure  in  the  radial  direction  surface  plasmon  polaritons  (SPP)  [5]  are  excited  on 
the lens surface when the lens is illuminated from the bottom with an external laser. 
The SPP dispersion law is shown in Fig.1(b).  In the frequency range marked by the 
box PMMA has negative refractive index n2<0 as perceived by plasmons (the group 
velocity is opposite to the phase velocity). The width of the PMMA rings d2 is chosen 
so  that  n1d1=  -  n2d2  ,  where  d1  is  the  width  of  the  gold/vacuum  portions  of  the 
interface. While the imaging action of our lens is based on the original superlens idea 
by J. Pendry, its magnification is based on the fact that all the rays in the superlens 
tend to propagate in the radial direction when n1d1= - n2d2 (see the inset in Fig.1(b)). 
This behavior was observed in the experiment upon illumination of the lens with 495 
nm  laser  light  (the  bottom  portion  of  Fig.1(c))  for  which  n1d1=  -  n2d2.    The  narrow 
beam visible in the image is produced by repeating self-imaging of the focal point by 
the alternating layers of positive and negative refractive index materials. On the other 
hand,  if  515  nm  light  is  used  the  lens  becomes  uncompensated  and  the  optical  field 
distribution inside the lens reproduces the field distribution in the normal “plasmonic 
lens” described in ref.[6] (see the top portion of Fig.1(c)).  
 
The  magnifying  action  of  the  superlens  is  demonstrated  in  Fig.1(d).    In  this 
experiment three defects have  been produced on the superlens surface, as shown in 
the  optical  image  obtained  under  white  light  illumination  from  the  top.  When  these 
defects are illuminated from the bottom with 495 nm laser light they produce plasmon 
beams, which are emitted in the radial direction. The lateral separation between these 
beams increases by a factor of two as the beams reach the outer rim of the superlens. 

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  experimental  demonstration  of  a  magnifying 
superlens in the visible frequency range.

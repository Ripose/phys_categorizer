Limits on the Thermo-elastic Coupling of Solids 

József Garai

Investigating homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic, non-viscous solids in a state of 

equilibrium it has been demonstrated that correlation between the temperature and the 

pressure can exist only at constant volume.  This correlation is irreversible and works in 

the temperature pressure direction.  The limited communication between the temperature 

and the pressure put constraints on the conversion of the thermal and the mechanical 

energies.  Based on these constraints it is suggested that adiabatic condition should not 

exist in solid phase in the elastic non-viscous domain.

The gas laws of Boyle and Charles and Gay-Lussac can be combined into a single 

equation, which is called the equation of state [EOS].  The EOS for ideal gasses can be 

 

 

written as 

nRT =

pV

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

where n is the number of moles, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature, p is 

the pressure, and V is the volume.  The gas constant can be written as the product of the 

Avogadro number [

AN ] and the Boltzmann constant [ Bk ], thus 

pV

 .

When the gas phase changes to solid then the relationship between the quantities of EOS 

becomes more complicated and two new thermodynamic parameters are introduced.  The 

function between temperature and volume is characterized by the volume coefficient of 

expansion [ Vα ]:

It is assumed that the solid is homogeneous, isotropic, non-viscous and has linear 

elasticity.  It is also assumed that the stresses are isotropic; therefore, the principal

It is generally assumed that beside the introduction of the bulk modulus and the volume 

coefficient of expansion no additional change is required when a system changes its 

phase from gas to solid.  It is also assumed that the rest of the thermodynamic equations, 

like work function, state functions, can be used without modification for solid phase. 

Investigating the physical changes caused by the phase transformation it can be noted 

that the physical process of the pressure is entirely different in gas and solid phase.  In the 

gas phase the pressure represents the collision density of the atoms/molecules, while in 

the solid phase the pressure is the result of the elastic resistance of the matter.  In the gas 

phase the relationship between the pressure and the temperature is described by the EOS 

(Eq. 1) while in solid phase no direct relationship between these two quantities is known.  

Besides the lack of direct relationship between the temperature and the pressure it is 

assumed that a complete thermo-elastic coupling exists in the non-viscous elastic domain 

of the solid phase.  This widely held consensus will be considered in detail. 

Investigating homogeneous, isotropic, non-viscous linear elastic solids in a state of 

thermodynamic equilibrium it can be seen that both temperature and pressure are the 

function of the volume: 

p = p(V)  

and 

 

 T = T(V) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(6) 

The functions of the pressure and the temperature to the volume do not necessarily lead 

to a function between the pressure and the temperature.  If a function exists between p 

and T then one of the conditions which must be satisfied is that the domain of V has to be 

the same for both the pressure and the temperature.  In gas phase this condition is 

satisfied since the domains are: 

p ≥>∞+

0

 

>∞+

0V ≥

  and 

>∞+

0T ≥

 

 

>∞+

0V ≥

 

 

 

(7) 

In order to investigate the domain of the volume it is necessary to calculate the volume 

at any pressure and/or temperature.  Allowing one of the variables to change while the 

other one held constant the calculation can be done in two steps (Fig. 1),

satisfied, a function between the pressure and the temperature can exist. 

The expressions of the volume coefficient of expansion and the bulk modulus contain 

the volume.  The volume is related by functions to both the temperature and the pressure.  

If the volume change caused by the pressure modifies the volume coefficient of 

expansion or the volume change caused by the temperature modifies the bulk modulus, 

then there is a correlation between the pressure and the temperature.  This possibility will 

be considered in detail. 

Investigating the volume coefficient of expansion at zero pressure can be written as

It also can be shown that the additional volume changes resulting from the temperature 

change such as the expanded volume and the compressed part of the expanded volume 

cancel each other out and the value of the bulk modulus remains the same.  The bulk 

modulus at temperature T can be written as

The same expression for 

TK  and 

0TK =  proves that the volume increase from the 

expansion is canceled by the compressed volume of the expansion and that the value of 

the bulk modulus remains the same regardless of the temperature. 

The temperature independence of the bulk modulus also means that the pressure 

volume relationship is independent of the temperature.  Changing either the pressure or 

the volume of a system will not have an effect on the temperature.  The temperature 

pressure relationship, which exists at constant volume, therefore, must be irreversible 

since the pressure change will not generate temperature change. 

The irreversibility can also be demonstrated by calculating the mechanical energy 

needed to change the pressure.  The pressure of a system can be changed by adding to or 

taking away mechanical energy from the system.  The mechanical energy or work 

between the initial and final state can be calculated (Fig. 2) as

 (30) 

Subscript i and f are used for the initial and final conditions respectively.  It has been 

demonstrated that the correlation between the pressure the temperature can exist only if 

the volume is constant.  In order to maintain constant volume the same mechanical 

energy with opposite sign has to be added to the system (Fig. 2):

 (31) 

The quantity of the energy needed to maintain the constant volume is the same as the 

initial mechanical energy; therefore, the volume restoration energy would use up all of 

the initial energy.  The result is that no energy is left which could be transformed into 

thermal energy.  The energy equivalence between the initial and the volume restoration 

energies proves that the pressure change will not generate thermal energy and the 

temperature will remain the same. 

At constant volume, the volume change resulting from thermal expansion is canceled 

by the volume change caused by the compression.  Using this expansion-compression 

volume equality the function between the temperature and the pressure can be written as

The irreversibility is true only for non-viscous elastic solids.  In the case of viscous or 

plastic deformations where frictional forces are present between the atoms/molecules the 

temperature pressure relationship becomes partially or fully reversible. 

In conclusion, the volume changes caused by the pressure and the temperature are the 

result of compression and thermal expansion respectively.  The pressure correlates with 

the compressed part

Putting a constraint on the volume by not allowing the system to expand freely 

converts the volume of expansion to a compressed volume.  This is the only condition 

when correlation between the pressure and the temperature can exist in a non-viscous 

elastic solid phase.  This correlation is irreversible since the pressure change of the 

system will not change the temperature of the system but rather its volume.  In solid 

phase the limited thermo-elastic coupling prevents the full scale communication between 

the mechanical and the thermal energies.  Based on these theoretical considerations it is 

suggested that adiabatic conditions do not exist in the non-viscous elastic solid phase. 

The limited thermo-elastic coupling of solids has far reaching consequences in every 

field of science as demonstrated in the following examples from both theoretical and 

applied fields.

In the non-viscous elastic solid phase the first law of thermodynamics and the 

conventional thermodynamic potentials, internal energy, enthalpy, Helmholtz free 

energy, and Gibbs free energy, which have been derived based on the assumption of free 

mechanical and thermal energy transfer, have to be modified by taking into account the 

limitations on thermo-elastic coupling.  The work function of non-viscous elastic solids 

along with the state functions will be discussed in detail in a separate paper. 

Solid state thermodynamic equations are used to determine the temperature inside the 

earth and other planets.  The temperature distribution as the function of depth (geotherm) 

is determined by assuming adiabatic conditions for 200 km and deeper regions.  Since 

adiabatic conditions do not exist in the non-viscous elastic solid phase the geotherm must

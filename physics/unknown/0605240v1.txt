An  experiment  for  studying  laser  self-guiding  has  been  carried  out  for  the  high 

power ultrashort pulse laser interaction with an underdense plasma slab. Formation of an 

extremely long plasma channel and its bending are observed when the laser pulse power 

is much higher than the critical power for relativistic self-focusing. The long self-guiding 

channel  formation  is  accompanied  by  electron  acceleration  with  a  low  transverse 

emittance  and  high  electric  current.  Particle-in-cell  simulations  show  that  laser  bending 

occurs when the accelerated electrons overtake the laser pulse and modify the refractive 

index in the region in front of the laser pulse.

Propagation  of  ultra-high  intensity  laser  beams  in  plasmas  has  recently  received 

much attention in connection with their potential applications for the development of x-

ray  lasers  [1],  plasma-based  accelerators  [2-4],  and  “fast-ignition”  of  precompressed 

thermonuclear fusion targets [5]. For all of these applications, it is necessary for the high 

intensity  laser  beam  to  propagate  controllably  over  a  long  distance  with  high 

directionality.  If  the  laser  peak  power  is  high  enough,  a  laser  beam  can  overcome  the 

natural  limit  of  refraction,  and  become  focus  in  the  plasma  due  to  non-linear  self-

interaction  [6,  7].  The  balance  between  the  self-focusing  and  diffraction  can  provide  a 

condition for the long-distance propagation of the beam with peak intensity higher than 

otherwise  achievable  by  focusing  in  vacuum.  The  self-guiding  of  a  long  enough  single 

laser pulse in a plasma is known to be unstable [8]. The laser pulse can change directions 

of  its  propagation  through  hosing  and  bending.  This  problem  has  been  addressed  in 

theoretical  papers  [8],  but  so  far  no  experimental  evidence  of  laser  pulse  bending  has 

been found. 

In  this  letter,  we  present  the  first  results  of  the  experimental  investigation  of 

relativistically  self-guided  high  power  ultra-short  pulse  laser  evolution  in  underdense 

plasmas  in  which  the  above  mentioned  bending  regime  is  distinctly  observed.  Despite 

bending the laser radiation propagates over a very long distance in an underdense plasma 

and is accompanied by ultrarelativistic electron generation. 

The  experiment  is  carried  out  in  the  Laser  Fusion  Research  Center  with  the 

SILEX-I  laser  [9],  which  is  a  100  terawatt  Ti:Sapphire  laser  working  at  a  centre 
wavelength  of  800  nm  with  a  laser  contrast  of  107.  The  pulse  with  a  duration  equal  to 

τ0=30 fs was focused with a f /3 off-axis parabola onto a focal spot size w0=16 µm. In the 
focal region the laser intensity is I=6×1018 W/cm2 on average and 1.2×1019 W/cm2 at the 

peak,  considering  ≈50%  of  energy  concentration  in  the  focal  spot.  A  supersonic  pulsed 

slab He gas jet is used in order to form a spatially well defined gas target. The gas jet is 

produced by a slit nozzle, which is 1.2 mm wide and 10 mm long with a rectangular exit. 

After the nozzle, a beam charge transformer (BCT) is introduced in order to measure the 

electric  charge  of  the  accelerated  electrons.  A  DRZ  phosphor  screen    [10]  is  used  to 

detect the transverse spatial profile of the electron beam. A bluepass filter (410 nm - 532 

nm) is attached to a 16-bit CCD located in the laser polarization direction. It is used to 

 

2

measure the time-integrated plasma recombination fluorescence. A bandpass filter, with a 

bandwidth equal to 10 nm centered at 790 nm, is placed in the front of a CCD which is 

orientated perpendicular to the laser polarization and to the laser axis directions in order 

to measure the Thomson scattering of the laser light.  

Figs.  1(a)  to  1(c)  represent  the  images  obtained  in  the  Thomson  scattering 

measurements. The images are taken for different values of the plasma density when the 

laser pulse power is about 100 TW. We see in Figure 1(a), 1(b) that in the case of high 

gas pressure (p> 2.0 MPa) an extremely long plasma channel with a length approximately 

equal  to  ≈10  mm  is  formed.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  longest  self-guided  plasma 

channel  observed  till  now  stimulated  by  a  single  relativistic  intensity  laser  pulse 

propagating  in  underdense  plasmas.  We  note  that  in  the  moderate  laser  intensity  range 

multi-kilometer distance pulse propagation in air, when the self-focusing due to the Kerr 

non-linearity  is  balanced  by  the  plasma  effects,  has  been  observed  in  a  number  of  the 

experiments  [11].  In  Figure  1(b),  the  laser  diffraction  cone  is  drawn  to  highlight  the 

formation  of  this  long  plasma  channel  whose  length  is  a  factor  >  20  larger  than  the 
2 /λ, where w0 is the laser spot size and λ its wavelength. Under 

Rayleigh length ZR= πw0

the  experimental  conditions  ZR  is  about  ≈  400  µm.  The  Thomson  imaging  for  higher 

plasma  density,  shown  in  Fig.  1(b),  demonstrates  a  narrower  column  than  for  lower 

plasma density, presented in Fig. 1(a), along with weaker brightness. These correspond to 

the fact that the laser pulse with relatively higher energy is more effectively guided inside 

the  plasma.  For  relatively  low  pulse  energy  and  plasma  density,  as  shown  in  Fig.1(c), 

only a short and wide scattering region is seen with a length comparable to the Rayleigh 

length, giving evidence that a major part of laser photons is scattered out of that region.  

The change of the initial gas density and laser pulse energy has an expected effect 

on the self-focusing. In the case of an ideal Gaussian beam profile the critical power for 

self-focusing  [12]  is  Pcr=16.2(ncr/ne)GW,  where  ne  is  the  initial  plasma  density  and 
ncr=meω2/4πe2  is  the  critical  density.  When  the  backing pressure is above  2.0 MPa, the 
average  plasma  density  exceeds  5×1018  cm-3  according  to  the  calibration  curve  in  our 

experiment nozzle. The experiment’s 100 TW laser power is well above the self-focusing 

threshold. In Fig. 1(a) we see that the emitting plasma is confined inside a narrow column, 

exhibiting  pulse  self-focusing.  For  lower  plasma  density  and  lower  pulse  energy 

 

3

pronounced  self-focusing  is  not  observed.  This  can  be  explained  as  follows:  for  short 

enough pulses, much shorter than the wake wave wavelength, the self-focusing does not 

develop  because  the  summarized  plasma  collective  response  is  not  strong  enough  to 

substantially  modify  the  refractive  index.  In  this  regime  the  front  part  of  the  pulse 

expands over the distance of the order of the diffraction length ZR. In Ref. [13] it is shown 

that  when  the  laser  pulse  is  too  short,  self-focusing  does  not  occur,  even  for  powers 

greater than Pcr (see also computer simulation results presented in Ref. [14]). A roughly 

estimated threshold for the laser pulse length needed to self-focus can be written as llas ≥ 

λwf,  where  λwf≈2πc/ωpe  is  the  wake  wave  wavelength.  For  the  average  plasma  density 
5×1018cm-3, the  laser  pulse  length,  llas=12.5  µm,  is  of  the  order  of  the  Langmuir  wave 

wavelength, (λwf ≈13.5 µm), i.e. the laser pulse undergoes self-focusing over the length ≈ 
ZR(Pcr/P)1/2≈90  µm.  Our  experiment  demonstrates  that  the  laser  radiation  is  subject  to 

self-focusing  when  the  condition  llas  ≥  λwf  is  fulfilled.  On  the  other  hand,  if  llas  <<  λwf 

although the laser pulse power in the focal spot, 100 TW, is well above the critical power 

for self-focusing when the backing gas pressure is continuously reduced to 1.5 MPa, the 
averaged plasma density quickly decreases to ≈ 2×1018 cm-3 and it results in llas/λwf=0.6. 

Under  this  condition  laser  pulse  self-focusing  becomes  much  more  difficult  due  to 

defocusing  caused  by  the  electron  density  maximum  at  the  front  part  of  the  wake 

balancing  the  relativistic  focusing,  as  pointed  out  in  Refs.  [13,  14].  This  might  be  a 

reason for the observed plasma miss-channeling in the case of low plasma densities.  

In addition to the observation of the long plasma channel, the propagation of the 

laser  pulse  in  fact  becomes  dominated  by  the  long  scale  bending  as  revealed  in  PIC 

simulations presented in Refs. [15]. The self-focusing channel bending has been observed 

in  our  experiments  by  employing  the  Thomson  scattering  measurements  (see  Fig.  1(a), 

1(b)), and by using plasma fluorescence imaging (this is shown in Fig. 2). We see that the 

channel is bent significantly to the right side away from laser incident direction (top-view 

in  Figure  1)  in  the  plane  perpendicular  to  the  laser  pulse  polarization,  and  guided 

randomly shot by shot in the plane of the laser pulse polarization, as seen in Fig. 2. We 

mention  that  the  laser  pulse  does  not  show  bending  with  the  laser  pulse  incident  onto 

plasmas  in  the  low  energy  limit  when  we  check  the  CCD  in  the  laser  propagation 

direction. This excludes the possibility of laser misalignment or pointing vibration.

In order to unravel the physical mechanism for the self-focusing channel bending, 

we  carry  out  2D  particle-in-cell  simulations  of  the  interaction  of  a  laser  pulse  with 

underdense  plasma  with  the  use  of  the  REMP  code  [16].  In  the  cases  presented  here 

linearly p- and s-polarized laser pulses, with the electric field in the y- and z-directions, 

respectively, propagate along the x-axis. The laser pulses with a maximum dimensionless 
amplitude a0=3 have a Gaussian envelope with FWHM size 10×16λ2. The plasma density 
is n0=2×10-2ncr which corresponds to the ratio ωpe/ω=0.1412. The ions have an absolute 

charge equal to that of the electrons, and mass ratio mi/me=1836. The simulation box has 

10050×450 grid points with a 0.125λ mesh size. The target has the form of an underdense 

plasma  slab  of  size  1250×50λ2.  The  total  number  of  quasiparticles  is  about  108.  The 

boundary  conditions  are  absorbing  in  all  directions  for  both  the  electromagnetic  (EM) 

radiation  and  the  quasiparticles.  The  space  and  time  units  are  the  wavelength  λ  and  the 

period  2π/ω  of  the  incident  radiation.  In  these  simulations  we  have  chosen  a  plasma 

density more than an order of magnitude higher than in the experiment in order to have 

conditions which provide the laser pulse self-focusing and bending over the distance no 

greater than a millimeter, because full-scale detailed simulations of a one cm scale plasma 

length takes time and computer resources.  

The simulation results are presented in Figs. 3 and 4. In both cases of the p- and s-

polarized  pulses  the  simulations  show  formation  of  a  long  and  narrow  self-focusing 

channel  with  its  length  over  hundreds  of λ.  The  laser  pulse  undergoes  self-focusing,  as 

seen in Figs. 3 (a) and 4 (a). In Fig. 3 (a) we present the the z-component of the magnetic 

field  of  the  p-polarized  pulse  in  the  x,y  plane  at  t=250  2π/ω.  Fig.  4  (a)  shows  the  z-

component  of  the  electric  field  of  the  s-polarized  pulse  in  the  x,y  plane  at  t=250  2π/ω. 

The  pulse  generates  a  wake  field  which  accelerates  the  electrons  injected  due  to 

transverse wake wave breaking [17] (see Figs. 3 (b) and 4 (b), where the electron density 

distribution in the x,y plane at t=250 2π/ω is shown). In the case of the p-polarized pulse 

the  wake  is  asymmetric  at  the  front,  Fig.  3  (a),  and  shows  hosing,  i.  e.  there  are  low 

frequency  oscillations  in  the  transverse  direction  with  the  wavelength  along  the  pulse 

propagation  direction  equal  to  λc/(vph-vg)  with  vph  and  vg  being  the  phase  and  group 

velocities  of  the  pulse,  which  for  the  simulation  parameters  gives  30  λ  (see  theoretical 

description  of  the  hosing  in  Ref.  [15]).  Over  a  long  time  scale,  around  t=400  2π/ω, 

 

5

energetic electrons, accelerated by the wake field in the x-direction overtake the pulse and 

due  to  the  relativistic  dependence  of  the  electron  mass  on  the  energy,  modify  the 

refractive index in the front of the pulse [15,18]. In turn the effect of the initial deflection 

of fast electrons behind the pulse front is transferred by the electrons themselves to the 

plasma in front of the pulse. This results in an asymmetric change of the refractive index 

in  front  of  the  pulse,  which  causes  the  deflection  of  the  pulse  and  reinforces  the 

asymmetric acceleration of fast electrons inside the pulse. Simulation results of the laser 

pulse  with  both  the  p-  and  s-polarizations  demonstrate  that  the  self-focusing  is 

asymmetric with some filaments in the leading part of the laser pulse (see Figs. 3 (d) and 

4 (d)).  

Our  observations  show  that  plasma  emission  emanates  from  a  number  of  bright 

hollow  spots  situated  periodically  along  the  center  axis,  or  along  the  laser  bending 

directions in the vertical plane. It shows an “atoll” structure and there is a density valley 

in its center, as seen in Fig. 2. This phenomenon can be explained by paying attention to 

the formation of relativistic electron vortices, associated with a quasistatic magnetic field, 

which are clearly seen in Fig. 3 (a), and  a relativistic soliton train behind the laser pulse 

(see  Fig.  4  (a)).  Relativistic  electron  vortices  and  electromagnetic  solitons  are  basic 

entities generated in the nonlinear laser plasma interaction (e. g. see review article [20]). 

Inside the soliton a low frequency high amplitude electromagnetic mode is trapped. The 

ponderomotive pressure of this electromagnetic mode displaces electrons outward and the 

Coulomb repulsion in the electrically nonneutral ion core pushes ions away. As a result, 

bubbles in the ion density distribution are formed [21]. In the case of an electron vortex 

the cavity is formed by the quasistatic magnetic field pressure. In Figs. 3 (c) and 4 (c), 

where  the  ion  density  distribution  is  shown,  we  clearly  see  the  formation  of  cavities 

inside the self-focusing channel. 

Accelerated electron charge and emittance have also been studied experimentally 

in  the  case  of  the  long  plasma  channel  formation.  The  measured  electric  charge  of  the 

accelerated  electrons  (E  >1  MeV)  is  found  to  be  10  nC  per  shot,  which  is  the  highest 

value for laser accelerated electrons to the best of our knowledge. This electron bunch is 

tightly collimated with an emittance ≈ 0.8π mm mrad. However, for the shorter plasma 

channel formation, the maximum accelerated electron charge is dramatically reduced to 

 

6

0.5 nC, in conjunction with generation of a less collimated beam with emittance ≈ 4π mm 

mrad, see Fig. 5. When the long plasma channel is formed, we see quasi-monoenergetic 

electron  bunch  generation  at  70  MeV  with  a  well  defined  energy  spread  of  10  MeV  in 

FWHM. In addition, in the regimes of strong laser pulse bending the fast electron bunch 

is also bent in the same direction as the laser pulse as seen in Fig. 5.  

In summary, first experiments aimed at studying laser self-guiding in a long slab 

underdense plasma have been performed with 30 fs, 100 TW laser pulses. We observe a 

10 mm length plasma channel formation. In the case of laser pulse guiding inside the long 

channel a quasi-monoenergetic electron bunch is generated with very low emmitance and 

high electric charge. The laser bending is ascribed to accelerated electrons overtaking the 

laser pulse and changing the refractive index in front of the pulse.

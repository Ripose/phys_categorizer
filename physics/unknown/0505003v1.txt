Abstract: 
 
 
The spontaneous genesis of hydrocarbons which comprise natural petroleum 
have been analyzed by chemical thermodynamic stability theory. The constraints im-
posed upon chemical evolution by the second law of thermodynamics are briefly re-
viewed; and the effective prohibition of transformation, in the regime of temperatures 
and pressures characteristic of the near-surface crust of the Earth, of biological mole-
cules into hydrocarbon molecules heavier than methane is recognized. 
 
For the theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, a general, first-principles equa-
tion of state has been developed by extending scaled particle theory (SPT) and by us-
ing the technique of the factored partition function of the Simplified Perturbed Hard

Chain Theory (SPHCT). The chemical potentials, and the respective thermodynamic 
Affinity, have been calculated for typical components of the hydrogen-carbon (H-C) 
system over a range pressures between 1-100 kbar, and at temperatures consistent with 
those of the depths of the Earth at such pressures. The theoretical analyses establish 
that the normal alkanes, the homologous hydrocarbon group of lowest chemical poten-
tial, evolve only at pressures greater than approximately thirty kbar, excepting only the 
lightest, methane. The pressure of thirty kbar corresponds to depths of approximately 
100 km. 
 
For experimental verification of the predictions of the theoretical analysis, spe-
cial high-pressure apparatus has been designed which permits investigations at pres-
sures to 50 kbar and temperatures to 1500(cid:176) C, and which also allows rapid cooling 
while maintaining high pressures. The high-pressure genesis of petroleum hydrocar-
bons has been demonstrated using only the solid reagents iron oxide, FeO, and marble, 
CaCO3, 99.9% pure and wet with triple-distilled water. 
 
 
 
 
Natural  petroleum  is  a  hydrogen-carbon  [H-C]  system,  in  distinctly  non-
equilibrium states, composed of mixtures of highly reduced, hydrocarbon molecules, 
all of very high chemical potential, most in the liquid phase. As such, the phenomenon 
of the terrestrial existence of natural petroleum in the near-surface crust of the Earth 
has presented several challenges, most of which have remained unresolved until re-
cently. The primary scientific problem of petroleum has been the existence and genesis 
of the individual hydrocarbon molecules themselves: how, and under what thermody-
namic  conditions,  can  such  highly-reduced  molecules  of  high  chemical  potential 
evolve. 
 
The scientific problem of the genesis of hydrocarbons of natural petroleum, and 
consequentially of the origin of natural petroleum deposits, has regrettably been one 
too much neglected by competent physicists and chemists; the subject has been ob-
scured by diverse, unscientific hypotheses, typically connected with the rococo hy-
pothesis(1) that highly-reduced hydrocarbon molecules of high chemical potentials 
might somehow evolve from highly-oxidized biotic molecules of low chemical poten-
tial. The scientific problem of the spontaneous evolution of the hydrocarbon molecules 
comprising natural petroleum is one of chemical thermodynamic stability theory. This 
problem does not involve the properties of rocks where petroleum might be found, nor 
of microorganisms observed in crude oil. 
 
This paper is organized into five parts.  The first section reviews briefly the 
formalism of modern thermodynamic stability theory, the theoretical framework for 
the analysis of the genesis of hydrocarbons and the H-C system, - as similarly for any 
system.

The second section examines, applying the constraints of thermodynamics, the 
 
notion that hydrocarbons might evolve spontaneously from biological molecules. Here 
are described the spectra of chemical potentials of hydrocarbon molecules, particularly 
the naturally-occurring ones present in petroleum. Interpretation of the significance of 
the relative differences between the chemical potentials of the hydrocarbon system and 
those of biological molecules, applying the dictates of thermodynamic stability theory, 
disposes of any hypothesis of an origin for hydrocarbon molecules from biological 
matter, excepting only the lightest, methane. 
 
In the third section is described a first-principles, statistical mechanical formal-
ism, developed from an extended representation of scaled particle theory appropriate 
for mixtures of aspherical, hard-body molecules, combined with a mean-field repre-
sentation of the long-range, attractive component of the intermolecular potential. 
In the fourth section, the thermodynamic Affinity developed using this formal-
 
ism establishes that the hydrocarbon molecules peculiar to natural petroleum are high-
pressure polymorphs of the H-C system, similarly as diamond and lonsdalite are to 
graphite for the elemental carbon system, and evolve only in thermodynamic regimes 
of pressures greater than 25-50 kbar. 
 
The fifth section reports the experimental results obtained using equipment spe-
cially-designed to test the predictions of the previous sections. Application of pres-
sures to 50 kbar and temperatures to 1500(cid:176) C upon solid (and obviously abiotic) CaCO3 
and FeO, wet with triple-distilled water, all in the absence of any initial hydrocarbon 
or biotic molecules, evolves the suite of petroleum fluids: methane, ethane, propane, 
butane, pentane, hexane, branched isomers of those compounds, and the lightest of the 
n-alkene series. 
 
 
Thermodynamic stability and the evolution of multicomponent systems. 
1. 
 
Central to any analysis of chemical stability  is the thermodynamic Affinity, 
A({mi}), which determines the direction of evolution of a system in accordance with 
the  second  law  of  thermodynamics,  as  expressed  by  De  Donder’s  inequality, 
¢ =

in which mi,r and ni,r are, respectively, the chemical potential and stoichiometric coef-
ficients of the i-th component in the r-th reaction; a designates the respective phase. 
The second law states that the internal production of entropy is always positive 
 
for every spontaneous transformation. Therefore, the thermodynamic Affinity,  (1),

(2) 

The inequalities (2) express the irreversibility of spontaneous transitions, and state, 
that:  for a spontaneous evolution of a system from any state, A, to any other state, B, 
the free enthalpy of state B must be less than that of state A; and that at no point be-
tween the two may the free enthalpy be greater than that of state A, or less than that of 
state B. 
 
The sum of the products on the second line of inequality in (2), of the thermo-
dynamic Affinities and the differential of the variables of extent, dxr, is always posi-
tive; and the circumstance for which the change of internal entropy is zero defines 
equilibrium, from which there is no spontaneous evolution. This is De Donder’s ine-
quality. 
 
The sum of products on the second line of inequality in (2) deserves particular 
note. In the second line of (2), Fk and dXk are, respectively, general thermodynamic 
r
r , as a special case.(3, 4) The ex-
m=F
forces and flows, and subsume Newton’s rule, 
a
pression in the second line of (2) states further that, for any circumstance for which the 
Affinity does not vanish, there exists a generalized thermodynamic force which drives 
the system toward equilibrium. The constraints of this expression assure that an apple, 
having disconnected from its bough, does not fall, say, half way to the ground and 
there stop (a phenomenon not prohibited by the first law), but must continue to fall un-
til the ground. These constraints force a chemically reactive system to evolve always 
toward the state of lowest thermodynamic Affinity 
 
Thus, the evolution of a chemically reactive, multicomponent system may be 
determined at any temperature, pressure, or composition whenever the chemical poten-
tials of its components are known. To ascertain the thermodynamic regime of the 
spontaneous evolution of hydrocarbons their chemical potentials must be determined. 
No consideration has been given, in the foregoing discussion of chemical ther-
 
modynamic stability, to the rate of increase of the variables of extent, dxr. Such is the 
subject of chemical  kinetics, not stability theory. The rate at which a reaction might 
occur cannot alter its direction, as determined by the second law of thermodynamics, - 
otherwise the second law would not exist.  The evolution of a system can admit inter-
mediate states, in which one (or more) intermediate product might possess a chemical 
potential considerably greater than that of any of the initial reagents. The presence of a 
selected catalyst can enhance a fast, reaction; and, if the system is removed rapidly 
from thermodynamic environment at which such reactions proceeding to the final state

tinely operates such processes. However, such complex, industrial processes are not 
mimicked spontaneously in the natural world. 
 
 
2. 

The thermodynamic energy spectrum of the hydrogen-carbon [H-C] sys-
tem; and the effective prohibition of low-pressure genesis of hydrocarbons. 
 
The thermodynamic energy spectrum of the chemical potentials [molar Gibbs 
energies of formation, D Gf] of the H-C system at standard temperature and pressure 
(STP: 298.15 K; 1 atm) are available from tables of chemical data.(5) The chemical 
potentials of naturally occurring members of the of the H-C system at STP are shown 
graphically in Fig. 1. Examination of the energy spectrum of these chemical potentials 
of the H-C system establishes at once that, at STP, the chemical potentials of the entire 
hydrocarbon system are remarkable for both their characteristic increase with degree 
of polymerization as well as their linear, and almost constant, magnitude of such in-
crease with carbon number. With increasing polymerization, the n-alkane molecules 
manifest increased chemical potential of very approximately 2.2 kcal per added carbon 
atom, or CH2 unit. (There exist also branched isomers whose chemical potentials differ 
from such of the normal configuration by, typically, 2-4%.) Such increase in chemical 
potential  with  increased  degree  of  po-
lymerization contrasts strongly with the 
thermodynamic spectrum of the highly 
oxidized, biotic carbon (“organic”) com-
pounds of the hydrogen-carbon-oxygen 
[H-C-O] system, which manifest consis-
tently  decreasing  chemical  potentials 
with increasing polymerization. This lat-
ter property allows the high degree of 
polymerization  and  complexity  of  the 
biotic compounds. 
 
Examination of the H-C-O system 
of  oxidized  carbon  compounds  estab-
lishes that the chemical potentials of al-
most all biotic compounds lie far below 
that of methane, the least energetic of the 
reduced hydrocarbon compounds, typi-
cally  by  several  hundred  kcal/mol.  Al-
though  there  exist  biotic  molecules  of 
unusually high chemical potential, such

(C38H44O), and some of the pheromone hormones, such compounds are relatively rare 
by abundance. They are produced by biological systems only when the producing en-
tity is alive, and at formidable metabolic cost to the producing entity; and the produc-
tion ceases with the death of the entity. Such compounds are not decomposition prod-
ucts of other biotic compounds, and are labile and themselves decompose rapidly. For 
these foregoing reasons, such compounds cannot be considered relevant to the subject 
of the origin of natural petroleum. 
 
The properties of the thermodynamic energy spectrum of the H-C and H-C-O 
systems, together with the constraints of the second law, (2), establish three crucial 
properties of natural petroleum: 
 
(1.)  The H-C system which constitutes natural petroleum is a metastable one in 
a very non-equilibrium state. At low pressures, all heavier hydrocarbon 
molecules  are  thermodynamically  unstable  against  decomposition into 
methane and carbon, - as is similarly diamond into graphite. 

(2.)  Methane does not polymerize into heavy hydrocarbon molecules at low 
pressures, at any temperature. Contrarily, increasing temperature (at low 
pressures) must increase the rate of decomposition of heavier hydrocar-
bons into methane and carbon. 

(3.)  Any  hydrocarbon  compound  generated  at  low  pressures,  heavier  than 
methane, would be unstable and driven to the stable equilibrium state of 
methane and carbon. 

 
 
These conclusions have been amply demonstrated by a century of refinery engi-
neering practice. The third conclusion has been demonstrated by many unsuccessful 
laboratory attempts to convert biotic molecules into hydrocarbons heavier than meth-
ane. 
 
There are three generic chemical processes which deserve specific considera-
 
tion: the “charcoal burner’s reaction,” the “bean-eater’s reaction,” and the “octane-
enhanced bean-eater’s reaction.” All describe limited reactions by which a highly oxi-
dized biotic molecule can react to produce elemental carbon when “carried” by a more 
thorough oxidation process. In both the following examples, the simple carbohydrate, 
sugar C6H12O6, is used as a typical biotic reagent; the same reasoning and results hold 
also for any of the highly-oxidized biotic compounds. 
 
 6C + 6H2O.  The chemical po-
tentials at STP for the simple carbohydrate C6H12O6, and water vapor at STP are, re-
spectively in kcal/mol: 218.720; -54.636. The thermodynamic Affinity for the “char-
coal burner’s reaction” to produce amorphous carbon, or graphite, is, accordingly, 
109.10 kcal. Therefore, the genesis of coal from biological detritus in an oxygen-poor 

The “charcoal burner’s reaction” is:  C6H12O6 ﬁ

environment is permitted by the second law. However, the thermodynamic Affinity for 
the “charcoal burner’s reaction” to produce diamond is 105.02 kcal, which quantity is 
also positive, and therefore not immediately prohibited by the second law as expressed 
solely by de Donder’s inequality, the first of equations (2). Nonetheless, no charcoal 
burner ever scrabbles through his ashes hoping to find diamonds. Such reasonable be-
havior demonstrates an effective appreciation of the dictates of the second law as ex-
pressed by the second of equations (2). In this case, the generalized force is the differ-
ence in thermodynamic Affinity between the reactions for graphite and diamond, re-
spectively, dF = dA/T, which, in the regime of temperatures and pressures of the near-
surface crust of the Earth, assures always spontaneous genesis of graphite, but never of 
diamond. Similarly, for reactions involving hydrocarbons heavier than methane, the 
same generalized force, dA/T, always drives the system toward the state of lowest free 
enthalpy, i.e., methane plus free carbon. 
 
 3CH4 + 3CO2.   The chemical po-
tentials at STP for methane, and carbon dioxide are, respectively in kcal/mol: --12.130; 
and  -94.260.  The  thermodynamic  Affinity  for  this  reaction  is  accordingly  100.42 
kcal/mol, and therefore permitted by the second law. Indeed, reactions of the type are 
typical of those by which methane is produced in swamps, sewers, and the bowels of 
herbivores. 
 
 1/8C8H18 +7/8H2 + 
2CH4 + 3CO2.  Since the chemical potential at STP of n-octane is 4.290 kcal/mol, and 
that  of  molecular  hydrogen  is  zero,  the  thermodynamic  Affinity  for  the  “octane-
enhanced bean-eater’s reaction” is A = (100.42 - 12.130 - 4.290/8) = 87.70 kcal/mol, 
still positive and thereby not prohibited outright by the constraints of De Donder’s 
inequality. However, no biochemical investigation has ever observed a molecule of 
any hydrocarbon heavier than methane resulting from the decomposition of biological 
detritus.  After  a  meal  of,  e.g.,  Boston  baked beans, one does experience biogenic 
methane, - but not “biogenic” octane. No such process produces heavier hydrocarbons, 
for such process would involve effectively a reaction of low-pressure methane polym-
erization, similarly as the effective prohibition of the evolution of diamonds by the 
“charcoal burner’s reaction.”  In the previous section was described the industrial 
technique by which useful intermediate products can be obtained by controlling the re-
action process.  The Fischer-Tropsch process uses reactions essentially identical to the 
“octane-enhanced bean-eater’s reaction” to generate liquid petroleum fuels from the 
combustion of coal, wood, or other biotic matter.  However, the highly-controlled, in-
dustrial Fischer-Tropsch process does not produce, uncontrolled and spontaneously, 
the commonly observed, large accumulations of natural petroleum.  
The foregoing properties of natural petroleum, and the effective prohibition by 
 
the second law of thermodynamics of its spontaneous genesis from highly-oxidized 
biological molecules of low chemical potentials, were clearly understood in the second

half of the 19th century by chemists and thermodynamicists, such as Berthelot, and 
later confirmed by others, including Sokolov, Biasson, and Mendeleev. However, the 
problem of how, and in what regime of temperature and pressure, hydrogen and car-
bon combine to form the particular H-C system manifested by natural petroleum, re-
mained. The resolution of this problem had to wait a century for the development of 
modern atomic and molecular theory, quantum statistical mechanics, and many-body 
theory. This problem has now been resolved theoretically by determination of the 
chemical potentials and the thermodynamic Affinity of the H-C system, using modern 
quantum statistical mechanics, and has also now been demonstrated experimentally 
with specially designed high-pressure apparatus.

Calculation of the thermodynamic Affinity using scaled particle theory 
[SPT] and the formalism of the Simplified Perturbed Hard Chain Theory 
[SPHCT]. 
In order to calculate the thermodynamic Affinity of a distribution of compounds 
 
of the hydrogen-carbon (H-C) system in general regimes of temperature and pressure, 
one must use a rigorous mathematical formalism developed from first-principles, sta-
tistical mechanical argument. No approximate, or interpolated, formalism developed 
for the low-pressure regime can suffice. A sufficiently rigorous formalism has been 
developed by extending scaled particle theory [SPT] equation of state of Pavlícek, 
Nezbeda, and Boublík,(6, 7) for mixtures of convex, hard-body systems, combined 
with the formalism of the Simplified Perturbed Hard Chain Theory (SPHCT).(8) 
 
Following the procedure enunciated originally by Bogolyubov,(9) and devel-
oped further by Feynmann(10) and Yukhnovski,(11) a factored partition function is 
used which employs a reference system:  Q = QrefQvdW.  The  reference  system  em-
ployed is that of the hard-body fluid as described rigorously by scaled particle theory 
[SPT].(12-15) The description of the hard-body fluid by scaled particle theory is one 
of the few exactly-solvable problems in statistical mechanics. This property is espe-
cially valuable because the thermodynamic evolution of a system at high pressures is 
determined almost entirely by the variables of its components that are obtained from 
the reference system. 
 
For mixtures of hard-body particles of different sizes and shapes, scaled particle 
theory generates the following analytical expression for the contribution to the pres-
sure of the hard-core reference system:

are used, the contribution of the reference system to the pressure and the Free enthalpy 
become simplified functions of the packing-fraction, h, and the geometric composi-
tional variables, a and g. 
 
The contributions to the pressure and the  chemical potentials from the long-
range van der Waals component of the intermolecular potential are described using the 
formalism  of  the  Simplified  Perturbed  Hard  Chain  Theory  [SPHCT].(17-19) The 
SPHCT uses the mean-field technique,(20) of the Bethe-Peierls-Prigogine “lattice-gas” 
model, in which has been applied the shape-independent scattering formalism.(21) As 
demonstrated previously,(22) at elevated pressures, the pressure and chemical poten-
tial are dominated by their respective hard-core components, and the attractive compo-
nent is several orders of magnitude smaller, and of little consequence. The representa-
tion of the attractive components of the pressure and the chemical potential used has 
been  that  developed  for  the  SPHCT  by  Sandler,(23),  Donohue,  (19),  Lee  and 
Chao,(24) using the mixing rules of Kim.(25)   The Prigogine shape c-factors used by 
the  SPHCT  are  related  to  the  Boublík  geometric  parameters  such  that:

methane at high pressures. 
At standard temperature and pressure, methane possesses the lowest chemical 
 
potential and is the only thermodynamically stable hydrocarbon. At low pressures, and 
all temperatures, all hydrocarbons are thermodynamically unstable relative to methane, 
or methane plus carbon (either graphite or 
amorphous  carbon).  At  normal  tempera-
tures and pressures, the evolution of meth-
ane will dominate and effectively exhaust 
the  H-C  system  of  its  elemental  compo-
nents. Because methane is the sole hydro-
carbon specie which is thermodynamically 
stable at low pressures, the chemical Affini-
ties  of  each  of  the  heavier  species  have 
been calculated in comparison with meth-
ane.  Accordingly,  the  chemical  Affinity 
calculated for the thermodynamic stability 
of, for example, the methane «
 (n-octane + 
hydrogen) system, is that for the reaction: 
CH4 ﬁ
 1/8 C8H18 + 7/8 H2. 
 
The  chemical  potentials  of  the  hy-
drocarbon and methane molecules, and the 
resulting thermodynamic Affinities of the 
(methane  (cid:128)   hydrocarbon + hydrogen) 
system,  have  been  evaluated  for  the  n-

Fig. 2 are shown the Gibbs energies for the set of hydrocarbons methane (CH4), and 
the n-alkanes, ethane (n-C2H6), hexane (n-C6H14), and decane (n-C10H22). These ther-
modynamic variables have been determined at pressures ranging from 1-100,000 bar 
and at the supercritical temperature 1000 K, which temperature corresponds conserva-
tively to the geological regime characterized by the respective pressures of transition. 
 
The values of the SPHCT parameters, c, h, and Y, for the individual compounds 
which have been used were taken from van Pelt et al.,(27) and the reference values of

the chemical potentials of the pure component were taken from standard reference ta-
bles.(3) 
The results of the analysis are shown graphically for the temperature 1000 K in 
 
Fig. 2. These results demonstrate clearly that all hydrocarbon molecules are chemi-
cally and thermodynamically unstable relative to methane at pressures less than ap-
proximately 25 kbar  for  the  lightest, ethane, and 40 kbar for the heaviest n-alkane 
shown, decane. 
 
lowing: 
 
1.)  With the exception of methane, heavier hydrocarbon molecules of higher 
chemical potentials are not generated spontaneously in the low-pressure 
regime of methane synthesis. 

The results of this analysis, shown graphically in Fig. 2, establish clearly the fol-

2.)  All hydrocarbon molecules other than methane are high-pressure poly-
morphs of the H-C system and evolve spontaneously only at high pressures, 
greater  than,  at  least,  25 kbar  even  under  the  most  favorable  circum-
stances. 

3.)  Contrary to experience of refinery operations conducted at low pressures, 
heavier alkanes are not unstable and do not necessarily decompose at ele-
vated temperatures. Contrarily, at high pressures, methane transforms into 
the heavier alkanes, and the transformation processes are enhanced by ele-
vated temperatures. 

 
 
The theoretical analyses reported here describe the high-pressure evolution of 
hydrocarbons under the most favorable chemical conditions. Therefore, although this 
analysis describes the thermodynamic stability of the H-C system, it does not explic-
itly do the same for the genesis of natural petroleum in the conditions of the depths of 
the Earth. The chemical conditions of the Earth, particularly near its surface, are oxi-
dizing, not reducing; of the gases in the Earth’s atmosphere and crust, hydrogen is sig-
nificantly absent and methane a very minor constituent. 
 
Although both methane and heavier hydrocarbons were present in the carbona-
ceous meteorites which participated in the accretion process of the formation of the 
Earth, such molecules were unlikely to have survived in their initial composition. The 
heat and impact which accompanied accretion would most likely have caused decom-
position of heavier hydrocarbons and the release of methane. For both the theoretical 
analyses described in this section and the experimental investigations described in sec-
tion 6, the conservative perspective has been taken that hydrocarbons evolve from the 
solid, abiotic carbon compounds and vestigial water present in the upper mantle of the 
Earth.

Experimental demonstration of hydrocarbon genesis, under  thermody-
namic conditions typical of the depths of the Earth. 
Because the H-C system typical of petroleum is generated at high pressures, and 
 
exists only as a metastable mélange at laboratory pressures, special high-pressure ap-
paratus has been designed which permits investigations at pressures to 50 kbar and 
temperatures to 1500°C, and which also allows rapid cooling while maintaining high 
pressures.(28) The importance of this latter ability cannot be overstated; for, in order 
to examine the spontaneous reaction products, the system must be rapidly quenched to 
“freeze  in”  their  high-pressure,  high-temperature  distribution.  Such  mechanism  is 
analogous to that which occurs during eruptive transport processes responsible for 
kimberlite ejecta, and for the stability and occurrence of diamonds in the crust of the 
Earth. 
 
Experiments to demonstrate the high-pressure genesis of petroleum hydrocar-
bons have been carried out using only 99.9% pure, solid iron oxide, FeO, and marble, 
CaCO3, wet with triple-distilled water. There were no biotic compounds or hydrocar-
bons admitted to the reaction chamber. The use of marble, instead of elemental carbon, 
was intentionally conservative. The initial carbon compound, CaCO3, is more oxidized 
and of lower chemical potential. All of which rendered the system more resistant to the 
reduction of carbon to form heavy alkanes, than it would be under conditions of the 
mantle of the Earth. Although there has been observed igneous CaCO3 (carbonatite) of 
mantle origin, carbon should be more reasonably expected to exist in the mantle of the 
Earth as an element in its dense phases: cubic (diamond), hexagonal (lonsdaleite), or 
random-close-pack (chaoite). 
Pressure in the reaction cell, as described in (25) of volume 0.6 cm3, was meas-
 
ured by a pressure gauge calibrated using data of the phase transitions of Bi, Tl, and 
PbTe.  The cell was heated by a cylindrical graphite heater; its temperature was meas-
ured using a chromel-alumel thermocouple and was regulated within the range – 5°C.  
Both stainless steel and platinum reaction cells were used; all were constructed to pre-
vent contamination by air and to provide impermeability during and after each experi-
mental run. 
The  reaction  cell  was  brought  from  1  bar  to  50  kbar  gradually, at a rate of 
 
2 kbar/min, and from room temperature to the elevated temperatures of investigation at 
the rate of 100 K/min. The cell and reaction chamber were held for at least an hour at 
each temperature for which measurements were taken in order to allow the H-C sys-
tem to come to thermodynamic equilibrium. The samples were thenafter quenched rap-
idly at the rate of 700°C/sec to 50(cid:176) C, and from 50(cid:176) C to room temperature over several 
minutes, while maintaining the high pressure of investigation. The pressure was then 
reduced gradually to 1 bar at the rate of 1 kbar/min. The reaction cell was then gently 
heated to desorb the hydrocarbons for mass spectrometer analysis, using an HI-120 1B

istration.  A specially-designed high-temperature gas probe allowed sampling the cell 
while maintaining its internal pressure. 
At pressures below 10 kbar, no hydro-
 
carbons heavier than methane were present. 
Hydrocarbon  molecules  began  to  evolve 
above 30 kbar. At 50 kbar and at the tempera-
ture  of  1500°C,  the  system  spontaneously 
evolved  methane,  ethane,  n-propane,  2-
methylpropane,  2,2-dimethylpropane,  n-bu-
tane,  2-methylbutane,  n-pentane,  2-methyl-
pentane,  n-hexane,  and  n-alkanes  through 
C10H22, ethene, n-propene, n-butene, and n-
pentene,  in  distributions  characteristic  of 
natural  petroleum.  The  cumulative  abun-
dances of the subset of evolved hydrocarbons 
consisting of methane and n-alkanes through 
n-C6H14 are shown in  Fig. 3 as functions of 
temperature. Methane (on the right scale) is 
present and of abundance approximately an 
order  of  magnitude  greater  than  any  single 
component of the heavier n-alkanes, although 
as a minor component of the total H-C sys-
tem. That the extent of hydrocarbon evolution 
becomes  relatively  stable  as  a  function  of 
temperature  above  approximately  900°C, 
both for the absolute abundance of the indi-
vidual hydrocarbon species as well as for their relative abundances, argues that the dis-
tributions observed represent thermodynamic equilibrium for the H-C system. That the 
evolved hydrocarbons remain stable over a range of temperatures increasing by more 
than 300 K demonstrates the third prediction of the theoretical analysis:  Hydrocar-
bon molecules heavier than methane do not decompose with increasing tempera-
ture in the high-pressure regime of their genesis. 
 
Discussion and conclusions. 
7. 
 
The pressure of 30 kbar, at which the theoretical analyses of the section 5 pre-
dicts that the H-C system must evolve ethane and heavier hydrocarbon compounds, 
corresponds to a depth of more than 100 km. The results of the theoretical analysis 
shown in Fig. 2 clearly establish that the evolution of the molecular components of 
natural petroleum occur at depth at least as great as those of the mantle of the Earth, as

alkanes through n-C6H14 on left or-

rates in the depths of the Earth. 
 
As noted, the theoretical analyses reported in section 5 describes the high-pres-
sure evolution of hydrocarbons under the  most favorable chemical conditions. The 
theoretical  calculations for the evolution of hydrocarbons posited the presence of 
methane, the genesis of which must itself be demonstrated in the depths of the Earth 
consistent with the pressures required for the evolution of heavier hydrocarbons. Fur-
thermore, the multicomponent system analyzed theoretically included no oxidizing re-
agents which would compete with hydrogen for both the carbon and any free hydro-
gen. The theoretical analysis assumed also the possibility of at least a metastable pres-
ence of hydrogen. Therefore, the theoretical results must be considered as the determi-
nation of minimum boundary conditions for the genesis of hydrocarbons. In short, the 
genesis of natural petroleum must occur at depths not less than approximately 100 km, 
- well into the mantle of the Earth. The experimental observations reported in section 
7 confirm theoretical predictions of  section 5, and demonstrate how the iron com-
pounds interact under high pressures to reduce water, of which the hydrogen combines 
with available carbon to produce heavy hydrocarbon compounds. 
 
Notwithstanding the generality and 
 
first-principles rigor with which the pre-
sent theoretical analysis has used, the re-
sults of the theoretical analyses here re-
ported  are  robustly  independent  of  the 
details  of  any  reasonable  mathematical 
model.  The  results  of  this  theoretical 
analysis  are  strongly  consistent  with 
those 
by 
Chekaliuk,  Stefanik,  and  Kenney,  (27-
30) using less accurate formal tools. The 
analysis of the H-C system at high pres-
sures  and  temperatures  has  previously 
been impeded by the absence of reliable 
equations of state which could describe a 
chemically-reactive,  multicomponent 
system at densities higher than such of its 
normal liquid state in ordinary laboratory 
conditions, and at high temperatures. The 
first analyses employed the (plainly inadequate) Tait equation(31); later was used the 
quantum mechanical Law of Corresponding States(32); more recently has been applied 
the single-fluid model of the SPHCT.(29, 30) Nonetheless, all analyses of the chemi-

cal stability of the H-C system have shown results which are qualitatively identical and 
quantitatively very similar:  all show that hydrocarbons heavier than methane cannot 
evolve spontaneously at pressures below 20-30 kbar. 
The  H-C  system  does  not  spontaneously  evolve heavy hydrocarbons at 
 
pressures less than approximately 30 kbar, even in the most favorable thermody-
namic  environment.  The  H-C  system  evolves  hydrocarbons  under pressures 
found in the mantle of the Earth, and at temperatures consistent with that envi-
ronment. 
 
Significantly, these theoretical results are consistent with, and complement, the 
analysis of the genesis of the phenomenon of optical activity in abiotic fluids (includ-
ing natural petroleum) previously reported.(14) In the past, observation of optical ac-
tivity in natural petroleum had been spuriously claimed as evidence of a biological 
connection. Resolution of the problem of the intrinsic component of optical activity in 
natural petroleum has established that the imbalance of enantiomers which produces 
the effect is simply an inevitable manifestation of the complex behavior of multi-
component systems composed of “closely-similar” molecules at high pressures. 
 
 
In 1951, the Russian geologist Nikolai Kudryavtsev(33) enunciated what has 
become the modern Russian-Ukrainian theory of abyssal, abiotic petroleum origins, a 
fundamental tenet of which is that natural petroleum is a primordial, abiotic material, 
erupted from great depth. Kudryavtsev was soon joined by many prominent Russian 
geologists, geochemists, geophysicists, and petroleum engineers who together devel-
oped the extensive body of knowledge which now forms modern petroleum science. 
 
Modern petroleum science has heretofore been a geologists’ theory, supported 
by many observations, drawn into a comprehensive pattern, and argued by persuasion. 
By contrast, a physicist’s theory uses only a minimum of data, applies fundamental 
physical laws, using the formalism of mathematics, and argues by compulsion. The 
theoretical results here reported, use only the fundamental laws of physics and ther-
modynamics, and establish the provenance of modern petroleum science in the rigor-
ous mainstream of modern physics and chemistry. The experimental results here re-
ported, confirm unequivocally those theoretical conclusions, which may now be taken 
as foundations of the modern theory of abyssal, abiotic petroleum origins. 
 
Dedication: 
In the first instance, this article is dedicated to the memory of Nikolai Alexan-
 
drovich Kudryavtsev, who first enunciated, in 1951(1), what has become the modern 
Russian-Ukrainian theory of abyssal, abiotic petroleum origins. After Kudryavtsev, all 
the rest followed. 
 
This article is dedicated generally to the many geologists, geochemists, geo-
physicists, and petroleum engineers of the former U.S.S.R. who, during the past half 

 

Page 15 

century, developed modern petroleum science. By doing so, they raised their country 
from being, in 1946, a relatively petroleum-poor one, to the greatest petroleum produc-
ing and exporting nation in the world. 
This article is dedicated specifically to the late Academician Emmanuil Bogda-
 
novich Chekaliuk, the greatest statistical thermodynamicist ever to have turned his 
formidable intellect to the problem of petroleum genesis.  In the Summer of 1976, dur-
ing the depths of the cold war and at immeasurable hazard, Academician Chekaliuk 
chose to respond, across a gulf of political hostility, to an unsolicited letter from an un-
known American chief executive officer of a petroleum company headquartered in 
Houston, Texas. Thenafter and for almost fifteen years, Academician Chekaliuk was 
my teacher, my collaborator, and my friend. [JFK]

VIOLATION OF THE GAUGE EQUIVALENCE

Abstract

F. V. Gubarev et al. [4] (“On the signiﬁcance of the vector potential squared”) have argued that
the minimum value of the volume integral of the vector potential squared may have physical meaning,
in deﬁance of the equivalence of potentials which are connected by the gauge transformations. Earlier,

R. I. Khrapko proposed a gauge noninvariant electrodynamics spin tensor [1] (“Spin density of

electromagnetic waves”). The standard electrodynamics spin tensor is zero.

of a nonpotential electric ﬁeld.

All these quantities are diﬀerential forms. We name them simply forms. All derivatives considered

here are external derivatives. We say that an external derivation of a form results in the boundary of

this form, and we name the form under derivation a ﬁlling of the boundary. So Ei is the boundary

The forms φ0 and ∂if are referred to as closed forms because their external derivatives are equal to

It is obvious that any boundary is closed. That is, the boundary of a boundary is equal to zero.

Ei = ∂iφ = ∂i(φ + φ0), Bij = 2∂[iAj] = 2∂[i(Aj] + ∂j]f ).

2. True potentials
But, from our point of view, it does not mean that diﬀerent potentials which are connected by
the gauge transformations are completely equivalent to one another. There are preferred, ”true”
potentials, which correspond to a given electromagnetic ﬁeld. Early we have stated an assumption
that a spin tensor of electromagnetic waves is expressed in terms of such a vector potential [1]. The
standard electrodynamics spin tensor is zero.

A true vector potential can be get by the Biot-Savarat formula:

Aj(x) =

Z

Bi′j(x′)ri′

(x, x′)dV ′

.

4πr3(x, x′)

A true scalar potential can be get by a similar formula:
Ei′(x′)ri′

φ(x) =

Z

(x, x′)dV ′

.

4πr3(x, x′)

(1)

(2)

We use marked indexes. Primes belong to indexes, but not to kernel letters. In the integrals (1), (2)
the primes mark a varying point x′, but not another coordinate system.

The formula (2) does not meet in literature. It determines the potential φ uniquely, in particular,

in the case of a nonpotential electric ﬁeld.

We say that Ei generates φ by the formula (2) and Bij generates Ai by the formula (1), i.e. we
say that φ is the generation from Ei and Ai is the generation from Bij. Otherwise, we say that Ei is
a source of φ and Bij is a source of Ai. The symbol dagger
is used for a brief record of generating,
and the symbol times

†
marks a generation. So, the true potentials are given by the formulas:
iBij.

j =

φ

iEi, A
×

†

†

Thus,

is an operation which is inverse to an external derivation. Without indexes this looks as

follows:

†
∂ = ∂
†

†

= 1.

3. Generations are sterile
At this point, a problem arises. What shall we get if a generation will be used as a source of
a generation? What shall we get if a generation will be substituted in the integral formula? For
example, what is the value of the integral

j′(x′)ri′

(x, x′)dV ′

A
×

Z

4πr3(x, x′)

?

The question is a simple one: generating from a generation yields zero [3]. We say that generations

are sterile. For example,

j′(x′)ri′

(x, x′)dV ′

A
×

Z

4πr3(x, x′)

= 0,

brieﬂy:

i
†

jBij = 0.
†

It implies that a sterile addition to a source does not change the generation.

Thus,

2

∂ (ﬁlling) = ∂ (ﬁlling + closed form) = boundary (which is closed),
(source + sterile form) = generation (which is sterile)

(source) =

†

†

Now we can decompose any form into closed and sterile parts. For example:

because one can name the expressions

4. The conjugation. Chains of ﬁelds
In a metric space there is a relations between contra- and covariant tensors of the same valence
(with the same number of indices). For example, the metric tensor gik associates a tensor X ij with
the tensor Xmn = X ijgimgjn. This process is called the lowering of indices. In this case the same
kernel letter for the quantity is used.

In the electromagnetism a slightly diﬀerent process is used. We call this process the conjugation.
The conjugation establishes a one-to-one correspondence between forms and contravariant tensor

5. Vector potential squared
The article [4] is an occasion for this paper writing. The authors of the article [4] “argue that
the minimum value of the volume integral of A2 may have physical meaning”. In other words, the
potential which minimizes the volume integral is a preferred potential. The authors have designated
such a potential Amin.

We have named such a potential “true” potential: A

6. The standard electrodynamics spin tensor is zero
The energy-momentum tensor T αγ and the spin tensor Υαγβ (upsilon) are deﬁned by the following

equalities:

dP α = T αγdVγ,

dSαγ = ΥαγβdVβ

α, γ, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3.

Here inﬁnitesimal 4-momentum dP α and 4-spin dSαγ are observable quantities and dVγ is an 3-
element. So true deﬁnitions of the energy-momentum and spin tensors do not admit any arbitrariness.

The electrodynamic energy-momentum tensor is the Minkowski tensor.

T αγ =

F ανF γ

ν + gαγFνµF νµ/4.

−

Only this tensor satisﬁes experiments. Only this tensor localizes energy-momentum. The source of
the Minkowski tensor is

The Minkowski tensor is the true electrodynamic energy-momentum tensor. But a true spin tensor

tensor, and it was checked on directly [2].

The Rosenfeld’s pair is closed in the sense:

So, the Rosenfeld’s pair is closed relative both momentum and spin. This implies that external
sources of the Rosenfeld’s pair are zero.

αγβ = 0.

So, the subtraction eliminates the spin tensor and, in the case of jγ = 0, yields the Minkowski

energy-momentum tensor.

The elimination of the electrodynamic spin tensor provokes a strange opinion that a circularly
polarized plane wave with inﬁnite extent can have no angular momentum [7, 8], that only a quasiplane
wave of ﬁnite transverse extent carries an angular momentum whose direction is along the direction
of propagation. This angular momentum is provided by an outer region of the wave within which
the amplitudes of the electric E and magnetic B ﬁelds are decreasing. These ﬁelds have components
parallel to wave vector there, and the energy ﬂow has components perpendicular to the wave vector.
“This angular momentum is the spin of the wave” [9]. Within an inner region the E and B ﬁelds
are perpendicular to the wave vector, and the energy-momentum ﬂow is parallel to the wave vector
[10]. There is no angular momentum in the inner region [9].

But let us suppose now that a circularly polarized beam is absorbed by a round ﬂat target which
is divided concentrically into outer and inner parts. According to the previous reasoning, the inner
part of the target will not perceive a torque. Nevertheless R. Feynman [11] clearly showed how a
circularly polarized plane wave transfers a torque to an absorbing medium. What is true? And if R.
Feynman is right, how one can express the torque in terms of pondermotive forces?

From our point of view, classical electrodynamics is not complete. The task is to discover the

nonzero spin tensor of electromagnetic ﬁeld.

7. Spin tensor of electromagnetic waves
For getting the Minkowski tensor from the canonical tensor in the general case of jγ

= 0 we have

to subtract

What tensor ˜Υαγβ must we then subtract from Υ

αγβ for getting the true spin tensor?

We suggested that

˜Υαγβ = Υ

This way we obtain an electric spin tensor:

˜Υαγβ = 2A[α∂|β|Aγ].

The electromagnetic covariant tensor ﬁeld Fµν is closed:

∂[αFµν] = 0

6

6
. But, for waves the conjugate tensor is closed too (we omit wedge in Sec. 6, 7, 8):

Therefore F µν has a ﬁlling, Πµνσ,

∂ν(⋆Fµν) = ∂νF µν = jµ = 0.

∂σΠµνσ = F µν.

We call Πµνσ an electric 3-vector potential.

The “Lorentz condition”, ∂ ⋆(Πµνσ) = 0, singles an electric vector potential out from the collection
of the gauge equivalent potentials. We call an electric vector potential the true potential if ∂[λΠµνσ] =
0.

Πα = ǫαµνσΠµνσ and Aα are equal in rights. So the spin tensor must be symmetric relative to the
magnetic and the electric potentials. Therefore we suggested that the spin tensor of electromagnetic
waves is the sum:

Υαγβ = Υ
e

αγβ + Υ
m

αγβ = A[α∂|β|Aγ] + Π[α∂|β|Πγ].

8. Circularly polarized standing wave
Let us consider a circularly polarized plane wave which falls upon a superconducting x, y-plain,
and reﬂects from it, and so a standing wave forms. The ﬂux density of energy (or volumetric
momentum density) is equal to zero in the wave, T tz = E
B = 0. But the volumetric densities
of electrical and magnetic energy vary with z in anti-phase. So the total energy density is constant.
The momentum ﬂux density, that is the pressure, is constant too:

×

E2/2 = 1

cos 2kz, B2/2 = 1 + cos 2kz,

T tt = T zz = (E2 + B2)/2 = 2.

−

It is interesting to calculate an output of the expression (3) in the situation. The spin ﬂux density
must be zero, Υxyz = 0, and it is expected that the volumetric spin density consists of electrical and
magnetic parts which are shifted relative to one another. This result is obtained below.

A circularly polarized plane wave which propagates along z-direction involves the vectors B, E,
A, Π which lay in xy-plane, and we shall represent them by complex numbers instead of real parts
of complex vectors.

B = Bx + iBy.

Then the product of a complex conjugate number E and other number B is expressed in terms of
scalar and vector products of the corresponding vectors. For example:

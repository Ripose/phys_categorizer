Abstract 

Allosteric regulation is an important property for many proteins. Several models have 

been proposed to explain the allosteric effect, such as the concerted MWC (Monod, 

Wyman, Changeux) model, the sequential KNF (Koshland, Nemethy, Filmer) model, and 

recent population shift models. Here we discuss a unified theoretical framework to 

describe allosteric effects. The existing models appear as special cases of the framework. 

The theoretical work also reveals an alternative mechanism currently overlooked. 

Theoretically it is possible that the reactivity of a protein is limited by some internal 

conformational change step (due to slow effective diffusion along rugged potential 

surfaces). Effector binding may modify the ruggedness and thus the protein dynamics and 

reactivity. Compared to conventional models, the new mechanism has less requirements 

on the mechanical properties of an allosteric protein to propagate mechanical signals over 

long distances. Thus some signal transduction proteins may adopt the new mechanism or 

a combination with conventional mechanisms. For a positive allosteric enzyme 

functioning under the new mechanism, the theory predicts that compared to the case with 

effector binding, an enzyme without effector has: 1) larger temperature dependence; 2) 

larger effect of dynamic disorders; 3) smaller collective and individual dynamic 

fluctuations; 4) no requirement for a well-defined mechanical strain relaying network; 5) 

no requirement for large conformational change upon effector binding. Opposite 

predictions of (1)-(3) are for negative allosteric proteins.

Introduction  

A prominent property of proteins is that their catalytic activities can be regulated. 

Allosteric enzymes have two or more binding sites. Conformational changes due to 

ligand (effector) binding or reaction on one site can propagate to another distant catalytic 

site and affect its reactivity. The discovery of allosteric regulations “in the 1950s, 

followed by a general description of allostery in the early 1960s, was revolutionary at the 

time”(1). Not surprisingly understanding the allosteric mechanism(s) is an important 

topic in structural biology. There are two popular models proposed to explain the 

allosteric effects. The concerted MWC model by Monod, Wyman, and Changeux, 

assumes that an allosteric protein can exist in two (or more) conformations with different 

reactivity, and effector binding modifies the thermal equilibrium distribution of the 

conformers(2). Recent population shift models re-emphasize the idea of preexisting 

populations (3-9). The sequential model described by Koshland, Nemethy, and Filmer is 

based on the induced-fit mechanism, and assumes that effector binding results in (slight) 

structural change at another site and affects the substrate affinity(10). While different in 

details, both of the above models assume that the allosteric mechanism is through 

modification of the equilibrium conformation of the allosteric protein by effector binding. 

For later discussions, we denote the mechanisms as “thermodynamic regulation”. The 

above two mechanisms and generalizations have been used to explain observed allosteric 

effects. For example, the allosteric effect is used to explain the working mechanisms of 

protein motors(11).

The mechanisms of thermodynamic regulation impose strong requirements on the 

mechanical properties of an allosteric protein. The distance between the two binding sites 

of an allosteric protein can be far. For example, the bacterial chemotaxis receptor has the 

two reaction regions separated as far as 15 nm(12). Signal propagation requires a network 

of mechanical strain relaying residues with mechanical properties distinguishing them 

well from the surroundings to minimize thermal dissipation – Notice that distortion of a 

soft donut at one side has negligible effect on another side of the donut. Mechanical 

stresses due to effector molecule binding irradiate from the binding site, propagate 

through the relaying network, and con-focus on the reaction region at the other side of the 

protein. It is challenging to transmit the mechanical energy faithfully against thermal 

dissipation over a long distance. A possible solution is the attraction shift model proposed 

by Yu and Koshland(13).           

In this work, we will first discuss a unified theoretical framework describing allosteric 

regulation. Then we will discuss a theoretically possible alternative mechanism of 

allosteric regulation, “kinetic regulation”. Instead of large change of conformation and 

thermodynamic properties such as substrate binding affinity, the protein reactivity can be 

modulated by modifying protein dynamic properties. This idea is inspired by 

experimental and theoretical studies on dynamic disorders. Dynamic disorders refer to the 

phenomena that the ‘rate constant’ of a process is actually a random function of time, and 

is affected by some slow protein conformational motions (14, 15). Since the pioneering 

work of Frauenfelder and coworkers on ligand binding to myoglobin(16), extensive 

experimental and theoretical studies have been performed on this subject (see for 

 

4

example ref.(15) for further references). Recently existence of dynamic disorders has 

been demonstrated directly through single molecule enzymology measurements(17-19).  

Theoretical formalism of the allosteric effect  

Let’s first focus on the catalytic site being regulated. The catalytic site can be described 

by a few numbers of reduced conformational degrees of freedom and the reaction 

coordinates. Here we will use a specific example shown in Figure 1a to illustrate the 

general idea. The chemical reaction we consider is a head-on group-transfer reaction, AC 

+ B →A + BC. A possible choice of the reaction coordinate will be r = RAC/RAB, the ratio 

between two distances. The distance RAB is related to some motion along a 

conformational coordinate. For each of the two conformers in Figure 1a, dynamics along 

the reaction coordinate is described by a barrier crossing process, as shown in Figure 1b. 

Conformer 1 has a lower barrier than conformer 2 does, and thus has higher reactivity. A 

more complete description is to use the two-dimensional potential surfaces plotted in 

Figure 1c and d. Current existing models on allosteric effects differ in some details of the 

potential shapes. The KNF model (exampled by Figure 1c) emphasizes that without the 

effector the protein exists mainly in one form (conformer 2 in our case). Effector binding 

shifts the protein to another form with different reactivity. The MWC (exampled by 

Figure 1d) and the recent population-shift model emphasizes that there are pre-existing 

populations for all the possible forms, and effector binding only shifts their relative 

populations. The potentials shown in Figure 1c and d are only for illustrative purpose. For 

example, a protein governed by the KNF mechanism may have double-well shaped 

potentials as well. For barrier crossing processes, a system spends most of the time at 

 

5

potential wells, and the actual barrier-crossing time is transient. Therefore, one can 

reduce the two-dimensional surfaces (Figure 1c and d) to one-dimensional projections 

along the conformational coordinate (Figure 1e), and approximate transitions along the 

reaction coordinate by rate processes among the one-dimensional potential surfaces. This 

representation is widely used to model protein motors. Similar idea can also be found in 

the treatment of allosteric effects by Miyashita et al.(20)           

With the above introduction of potential surfaces, we can now formulate a theoretical 

framework for allosteric effects. Protein dynamics is affected by substrate binding. 

Therefore, a minimal model to represent the catalytic site is: Emp (empty), Rec (reactant 

bound), Prod (product bound). Figure 2 shows an example used in this work. Each state is 

described by a potential curve along the conformational coordinate, and localized 

transitions can happen between two potentials. For an enzymatic cycle, a reactant 

molecule first binds onto the catalytic site (Emp→Rec), then forms a more compact 

complex, next chemical reaction takes place (Rec→Prod), and finally the product is 

released (Prod→Emp). In the more familiar discrete kinetic form, the overall process can 

be represented as

, with E, R and P refer the

enzyme, reactant, and product. Notice that in general locations of the potential minima 

for different states may not be the same, and some conformational motion is necessary 

during the cycle. Figure 2b illustrates the system zigzags downward along the potential 

surfaces with interplay between chemical transitions and conformational movement. The 

figure resembles that used to describe protein motors(21).

temperature. Chemical transitions accompany motions along the conformational 

coordinate with x-dependent transition rates. The dynamics can be equally described by a 

set of coupled Fokker-Planck equations (here we only consider the steady state),

Where Di = kBT/ζi is the diffusion constant, Kij is the transition matrix element, and ρi is

Current existing models assume that effector binding at a remote site can affect the 

dynamics at the catalytic site by modifying Ui. While differing in details, these models 

assume that a quasi-equilibrium distribution can be established along the conformational 

coordinate, and thermodynamic treatment is appropriate. Thus we call these models 

“thermodynamic regulation mechanism”. However, at least in principle the drag 

coefficient ζi, can also be regulated, which leads to a “kinetic regulation mechanism” 

discussed below. 

 

7

Kinetic regulation mechanism 

The kinetic regulation mechanism is based on the experimental observation that protein 

conformational fluctuations can be very slow. Therefore, the equilibrium assumption in 

the existing allosteric effect models may not be valid. Variation of the dynamic properties 

along the conformational coordinate can have dramatic effect on the apparent protein 

reactivity. Our recent theoretical analysis showed that the observed slow protein 

conformational dynamics can be explained by the rugged protein potential surfaces(23). 

As one source of the ruggedness, irregular shapes of protein surfaces result in frequent 

random collisions during interfacial motions (see Figure 3b). The relative motions 

between two protein parts are then characterized by hopping over numerous potential 

barriers (refer the inlet of Figure 2a). For a potential surface with random ruggedness, 

Zwanzig showed that the barrier-hopping process can be approximated by diffusion along 

a coarse-grained smooth potential with an effective diffusion constant

, where D0 is the bare diffusion constant, and ε is the potential 

roughness parameter(24). The reported values of ε is 2-6 kBT(25, 26). With D0 = 10-6 

cm2/s, D can be reduced to 1 Å2/s with ε ~ 4.8 kBT. Thus internal diffusion can be a rate 

limiting step for enzymatic reactions and can in principle be regulated by allosteric effect 

(see Figure 2). 

Advantages of kinetic regulations 

Besides as a theoretical possibility, the dynamic regulation mechanism also has the 

following advantages over the conventional thermodynamic regulation mechanisms. 

 

8

First, it is an effective way to regulate the reactivity at a distant region. For an Arrhenius 

process, to increase the reactivity by 1010, the activation barrier needs to be lowered by 

23 kBT. On the other hand, for an internal diffusion limited process, the reaction rate is 

linearly dependent on the effective diffusion constant. The lower bound of the roughness 

parameter adjustment is 4.8 kBT to increase the reactivity by 1010. 

Second, it has less requirement on the mechanical properties of the protein. Figure 1e 

schematically shows the free energy profiles of a protein with and without the effector     

under the conventional allosteric mechanism. The free energy difference between the two 

curves, ΔU(x), is provided by the effector binding energy as a function of the 

conformational coordinate. Effective coupling of the two sites requires faithful 

transmission of the mechanical strain due to ligand binding from one site to another one. 

In terms of solid mechanics, the mechanical stress lines should propagate from one site 

and concentrate on another site. A set of mechanical stress relaying network is expected 

to perform the task(27). As illustrated in Figure 3a, these network residues should have 

mechanical properties distinctive from other residues to minimize lost to the 

surroundings. In other words, coupling between these relaying residues and others should 

be minimized. By comparison, under a dynamics regulation mechanism, the effect can be 

highly delocalized. As illustrated in Figure 3b, effector binding may affect the other site 

by fine regulating local structures far away from that site. By modifying the effective 

diffusion constant, these local modifications may affect the dynamics along the 

conformational coordinate x in our formalism. The latter is usually composed of 

collective motions including residues within the catalytic site and those far from it. The 

effect manifests itself through larger root-mean-square deviation as observed in NMR, x-

 

9

ray crystallography, and in molecular dynamics simulations. We suggest the dynamics of 

the collective motions to be examined as well.

different for different reactions, and some conformational motion is needed during an 

enzymatic cycle. Model parameters are given in Table 1 of Supporting Information. 

The Fokker-Planck equations were solved with the algorithm developed by Wang et 

al(28). Figure 4a shows the calculated enzyme turnover rate as a function of the internal 

diffusion constant. While the diffusion constant is not a rate-limiting parameter at high 

values (as compared to the chemical transition rates), at smaller values of D the turnover 

rate depends on the diffusion constant linearly which signatures existence of diffusion-

limited steps. Figure 4b shows the temperature dependence of the turnover rate. With 

high values of D, the exponential 1/T dependence mainly comes from the Arrhenius 

dependence of the transition rates. However with small values of D, the turnover rate 

shows strong non-exponential dependence, since the effective diffusion constant D has a 

Gaussian dependence on 1/T. Therefore the theory predicts strong non-exponential 

temperature dependence of enzyme activity in the absence of the effector provided it is 

 

10

regulated by the kinetic mechanism. Figure 4c also shows the waiting time distribution 

between two consecutive turnover cycles. The results are calculated with the formula 

derived by Gopich and Szabo(29). A system with low D values shows non-exponential 

distribution due to dynamic disorders. At high D values, effects of the dynamic disorders 

diminish and the distribution is exponential. Therefore, we predict that an enzyme 

functioning under the kinetic regulation mechanism shows larger dynamic disorders 

effect. This can be directly tested by measuring consecutive single enzyme turnover time 

distributions with and without the effector, an extension of the work done by the Xie 

group(18).   

In the current study, we use the Langevin equations to describe motions along the 

conformational coordinate. In general the dynamics should be described by a set of over-

damped generalized Langevin equations coupled to Markov chemical transitions (22),

The memory kernel M describes how the dynamics along the x coordinate is affected by 

dynamics of the remaining implicitly treated degrees of freedom at earlier time. 

Theoretically M can also be regulated, although many studies suggest a universal power-

law form(19). We performed numerical simulations of the coupled generalized Langevin 

equations with power-law memory kernels. The results also demonstrated that enzyme 

reactivities can be regulated by modifying ζ, in consistent with the Langevin dynamics 

results.

Concluding remarks 

In this work we proposed an unified theoretical framework describing allosteric 

regulation, with existing models as special cases.  Inspired by recent experimental studies 

on dynamic disorders, we also proposed a kinetic regulation mechanism. We suggested 

that protein dynamics can be rate-limited by some internal diffusion steps, and effector 

binding can change the situation and thus protein reactivity by modifying the effective 

internal diffusion constant. The allosteric mechanism of a given protein likely has 

contribution from both thermodynamic regulation (the conventional conformational 

change mechanism and the newly proposed entropic effect), and dynamic regulation 

proposed in this work (see also Equation (1)). Different proteins may differ on which 

effect is dominant.     

Recently relations between protein dynamic properties and allosteric effects have been 

extensively studied by both experimental and simulation techniques (3, 5-7, 9, 12, 30-35). 

It is proposed that the entropic changes associated with ligand binding contribute to the 

allosteric effect. This mechanism still falls into the category of the “thermodynamic 

regulation” discussed in this paper, since its effect is to modify the free energy function 

U(x).  The mechanism discussed in this work is related (since both considers the effect of 

rugged free energy landscapes(36)) but different. Some of the experimental evidence in 

supporting of the dynamic entropic effect mechanism, may also be explained by the 

dynamic mechanism discussed in this work. For example, both suggest a distribution of 

protein conformations, and un-necessity of well-defined mechanical strain relaying 

 

12

network. Indeed slow conformational dynamics has been observed for allosteric 

proteins(9).

Prod. All are in reduced units: for energy kBT = 1 except the temperature dependence results in 
Figure 4. For simplicity, the diffusion constants for the three states take the same value. The 
prefactors of the rate constants are chosen so that the maximum values of kRE, kPR, and kEP are 
approximately 10, 1.5, and 5, respectively.

Abstract 

Much  experimental  evidence  of  superluminal  phenomena  has  been  available  by 

electromagnetic  wave  propagation  experiments  in  both  dispersive  media  and  open  space. 

Based  on  the  first  principles,  we  study  the  superluminal  propagation  in  nondispersive 

medium  and  obtain  the following results: 1) the group velocity 

gv   and  the  instantaneous 

energy velocity 

eu  of the near-zone fields of source can be not only

also

;  2)  these  superluminal  phenomena  have  theoretical  foundation  in 

quantum field theory, and do not violate causality principle; 3) furthermore, we propose that 

the superluminal propagation of  evanescent waves,  which  is  also  related  to  the  one  of  the 

near-zone  fields,  correspond  to  the  spacelike  virtual  photon  process;  4)  the  experimental 

results  themselves  by  Mugnai  et  al  (PRE  48,  1453;  PRE  54,  5692)  are  qualitatively 

tenable, though their theoretical interpretations are problematic.

1. Introduction 

A series of recent experiments revealed that electromagnetic wave was able to travel at 

a  group  velocity 

v g

> or 
c

gv

0<

  ( c   is  the  velocity  of  light  in  vacuum)  in  dispersive 

media [1-4], in electronic circuits [5], and in evanescent wave cases [6-13].    In  fact,  over 

the last decade, the discussion of the tunneling time [14-15] problem has experienced a new 

stimulus  by  the  results  of  analogous  experiments  with  evanescent  electromagnetic  wave 

packets [16-17], related to which the superluminal effects of evanescent waves have been 

revealed  in  photonic  tunneling  experiments  in  both  the  optical  domain  and  the  microwave 

range [6-13].  All the experimental results have shown that the earlier quantum mechanics 

calculations for phase time do describe the barrier traversal time [13,18].   

Furthermore,  A.  Ranfagni  and  D.  Mugnai  et  al  have  reported  another  kind  of 

experiment in which microwave packets appear to travel  at a superluminal group velocity in 

open space [19-21], which is seemingly independent of tunneling process and is perplexing.  

This kind of experiment is more interesting because, according to the traditional theory, the 

group velocity in nondispersive medium has a physical meaning.  They interpreted the effect 

by  assuming  the  existence  of  a  special  kind  of  evanescent  wave  (leaky  waves)  [19]  or 

complex  waves  [20].    Another  interpretation  for  these  experimental  results  has  also  been 

given in [22-23], i.e. the so-called superluminal electromagnetic X-waves interpretation. 

However, all these interpretations  are  problematic  [24-26]  (the  criticisms  in  Ref.  [24-26] 

hold true also for Ref. [19-20] because of the improper assumption

in  Ref.  [19-20],  the  authors  extended  the  limits  of  a  geometric  angle  variable  from  real 

number to complex number, which is devoid of physical foundation.    As  for  Ref. [21], the 

error analysis of the data and the potential accuracy of the apparatus are subject to question 

[25-26]; whereas as for Ref. [19-20], according to our discussion,  the experimental results 

themselves  are  qualitatively  tenable  (but  not  quantitatively),  though  the  authors’ 

theoretical interpretations are problematic.         

In  this  article,  by  a  general  investigation  for  the  superluminal  propagation  of 

electromagnetic wave in  nondispersive open  space,  we  obtain  some  new  interesting  results.   

Furthermore,  we  give  a  unified  discussion  for  the  superluminal  phenomena  related  to  the 

evanescent  waves  and  the  near-zone  fields,  from  the  viewpoint  of  both  classical  and

3. The essential characteristic of the fields of horn antenna   

We might as well take horn antenna as the source of electromagnetic wave (see Fig. 2).   

Traditionally,  we  only  study  the  radiant  fields  of  horn  antenna,  in  spite  of  the  total  fields

including  near-zone fields  (in  this  paper,  the  near-zone  fields  of  an  antenna  include  the 

static-zone fields and the induction-zone fields).    In  fact,  when electromagnetic waves are 

incident  on  a  metal  surface,  the  free  electrons  nearby  will  be  forced  to  vibrate  and  excite 

electromagnetic  waves  in  return,  which  form  the  reflective  waves.    Therefore,  when  the 

electromagnetic  waves  propagate  along  a  metal  waveguide  and  arrive  at  a  metal  horn 

antenna,  every  location  on  the  metal  surface  where  reflects  electromagnetic  waves  is 

equivalent to a source or antenna generating electromagnetic waves.    Particularly,  the  inner 

surface of  a metal  horn  antenna  is  equivalent  to  a  set  of  elemental-area  antennas.    As  is 

known to all, an elemental-area  antenna  is  equivalent  to  a  pair  of  mutually  vertical  electric 

dipole  and  magnetic  dipole  antennas. 

  On 

the  other  hand,  according  to 

the 

electricity-magnetism  duality  principle,  the  fields  of  a  magnetic  dipole  antenna  can  be 

obtained  from  the  ones  of  an  electric  dipole  antenna.    Consequently,  we  can  grasp  the 

essential characteristic of the fields of a  horn antenna only by  considering the fields of  the 

electric  dipole  antenna.

According  to  the  simplified  consideration  mentioned  above,  in  the  local  spherical 

coordinate system

antenna),  we  consider  Equ.  5  only  in  the  case  of  k

  parallel  to  the  center  axis  of  horn 

antenna, so that we can study the primary feature of the fields of horn antenna by the fields 

v
of  electric  dipole  antenna.    Meanwhile,  we  assume  that  the  angle  included  between  k

In the open space only the group velocity has real physical significance.  We give the

5. On the anomalous propagation experiment in open space 

In  the  previous  sections,  the  essential  physical  features  of  the  fields  of  horn  antenna 

have been obtained by analyzing the fields of electric dipole antenna.    Following  Equ.8-11 

or Fig. 3-6 we summarize the main characters of the fields of horn antenna as follows  (note 

that 

k

=bcos

zk

 is the wavenumber component in the observe direction  z ): 

(A)    For  the  far-zone  fields  of  horn  antenna  (

kz

ﬁbcos

),  their  group  velocities  are 

c

bcos

 in the  observe direction (while the phase velocities are 

/c

bcos

); 

(B)  For  the  near-zone  fields  but 

,  the  group  velocities  of  all  the  non-zero  field 

1‡kz

 

7 

-
-
-
-
-
£
¥
components  are  c   (or  c   approximatively)  as 

0=b

;  while  as 

0„b

,  in  the 

observe direction the group velocities may become superluminal.   

(C) Moreover, as 

kz

cos

ﬁb

0

,  the  group  velocities  for  some  field  components  change 

from positive to negative infinity, while for the other components their group velocities 

change from  c  to positive infinity (see Fig. 3-6). 

Obviously, judged by the statements (A) and (B),  the experimental results obtained in 

Ref. [19-20] are qualitatively reasonable, which are described as follows  (sometimes we 

take the air medium as the vacuum one, which has no effect on what we discuss): by using 

launcher and receiver horn antennas, A. Ranfagni and D. Mugnai  et al have made measures 

of pulse delay in microwave propagation in open space and for short distances.  When the 

horn  antennas  are  facing  each  other  (corresponds  to 

0=b

)  they  observe  a  delay  time 

corresponding  to  a  speed  equal  to  c .    However,  if  the  receiver  horn  is  shifted  or  tilted 

with  respect  to  the  launcher  horn  (corresponds  to 

0„b

),  the  delay  time  decreases, 

showing a superluminal behavior, which disappears for longer distances (corresponds to the 

statement  (A)).    As  far  as  the  experiment  in  Ref.  [21]  is  concerned,  though  the  error 

analysis of the data (or the statistical significance of the data) and the  potential accuracy of 

the apparatus are subject to question [25,26], there is a case that may have nothing to do 

with  this  experiment:  if    we  take  the  two  opposite  surfaces  of  the launcher horn  and the 

circular mirror as the two end surfaces of a cylinder, the electromagnetic fields between  the 

two surfaces would become evanescent modes  provided that the interval between  them is 

small enough (in this case the electromagnetic fields are described by the Bessel function of 

imaginary argument), and then the superluminal propagation (related to the photon tunneling) 

along the radial direction of the cylinder would appear. 

 

8 

However, these experimental results in Ref. [19-20] do not agree with  statements (A) 

and  (B)  quantitatively  (e.g.,  in  our  case,  the  group  velocities  become  superluminal  as 

kz

cos <b

kz

cos

>b

1

; while in Ref.[19-20]  the  group  velocities  may  become  superluminal  even  as 

10

).  After all, the error analysis of the data and the accuracy of the apparatus 

in Ref. [19-20] are subject to question; on the other hand, the actual fields of horn antenna 

correspond to the superposition of the fields produced by a numbers of the electric and the 

magnetic dipole antennas, quadrupole antennas, etc., which must be reconsidered when one 

try to give a quantitative discussion.. 

6. Further consideration for the superluminal phenomena in open space 

Furthermore, one can easily obtain the instantaneous energy velocity vector 

  of  the 

v
eu

fields expressed by Equ. 5 (i.e. the 

th-k

  components) as follows: 

1)  In the far-zone, 

v
u

uuu

,

=

2)  In the near-zone,

, where

)

In  fact,  when  our  observation  is  performed  in  the  near-zone,  what  we  are  dealing  with  is 

instantaneous  velocity  instead  of  the  average  one,  owing  to  the  fact  that  as 

ﬁkr

  (or 

ﬁzk z

), the corresponding observation time

.  As it is given in the statement (C) 

and  Equ.  12,  the  group  velocity 

gv   and  the  instantaneous  energy  velocity

near-zone fields can be not only

          Further experiments are needed to confirm all these results.    Surely,  when

the corresponding experiment becomes difficult and even can hardly implemented.

7. The physical foundation for the superluminal phenomena in open space 

In undersize waveguide propagation  case,  the  superluminal  behavior  is  related  to  the 

evanescent waves, while in open-space transmission case, just as the experimental results in 

Ref.  [19-21]  and  our  theoretical  analysis  have  shown,  the  corresponding  superluminal 

behavior is related to the near-zone fields.  However, there exists a similarity between the 

evanescent waves and the near-zone fields: 

a) Within an undersize waveguide, the evanescent waves attenuate exponentially along 

the  direction  of  propagation,  and  the  average  power  flow  will  not  exist  in  the  waveguide 

because the impedance is purely capacitive (for the  TM  mode) or inductive (for the  TE  

mode),  causing  only  a  reactive  power  or  energy  storage  in  the  waveguide.    As  for  the 

energy storage in the undersize waveguide, the electric energy is more than magnetic energy 

for the  TM  mode and on the contrary for the  TE   mode.     

b) Similarly, the near-zone fields of an antenna are also sharply attenuated as compared 

with the far-zone fields of the antenna, and  the average power flow of the near-zone fields 

does not exist because the impedance is purely capacitive (for the electric dipole antenna) or 

inductive (for the magnetic dipole antenna), causing only a reactive power or energy storage.  

As for the energy storage in the near-zone of an  antenna,  the electric energy is more than 

magnetic energy for the electric dipole  antenna and on the contrary for the magnetic dipole 

antenna.   

In fact, the  similarity  between  the  evanescent  waves  and  the  near-zone  fields  is  not 

accidental.    As  for  a  waveguide,  When  its  cross-section  size  is  gradually  reduced  and 

becomes an cutoff one, the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves propagating along the 

waveguide  approaches  the  cutoff  wavelength,  the  wavenumber  component 

zk   along the 

 

10 

direction  of  waveguide approaches zero, then 

  for  any  given  position  z ,  that  is, 

1<zk z

the electromagnetic waves in the direction of waveguide correspond to the near-zone fields.   

The superluminal tunneling of photon in the undersize waveguide owes to the propagation 

law  of  near-zone  fields,  or  equivalently,  to  the  quantum  effects  (i.e.  the  position 

( z )-momentum  ( zk )  or  time-energy  uncertainty)  operating  remarkably  within  the  range 

1<zk z

.    In  the  case  of  frustrated  total  internal  reflection  [11],  a  similar  but  more 

complicated  analysis  can  be  provided.    That  is  to  say,  the  superluminal  phenomena  of 

evanescent waves are related to the ones of the near-zone  fields.    Sometimes  people  call 

the near-zone fields evanescent ones directly [28].     

Moreover, we propose that these superluminal phenomena have a common theoretical 

foundation  in  quantum  field  theory  and  do  not  violate  causality  principle.    As  for  our 

scenario, the electromagnetic fields can be taken as the Proca fields with the mass 

ﬁm

[29].    Let

  is  spacelike,  following  the  discussion  in  Ref.  [30]   (

,  and  the  conclusion  is  valid  as  the  mass

  too.    That  is,  the

superluminal propagation for photons is possible.  To really discuss causality, however, we 

should  ask  whether  a  measurement  performed  at  one  point  could  affect  another 

measurement at a point separated from the first with a spacelike interval  [30], rather than 

whether  particles  can  propagation  over  such  a  spacelike  interval.    Therefore,  we  should 

compute 

 

the 

commutator

  Since 

this 

commutator vanishes provided that

  is  spacelike,  causality  is  preserved.    Likewise, 

the conclusion is valid as the mass 

0

.    In  quantum  mechanics  language,  because of 

the quantum effects, e.g. the position-momentum uncertainty, superluminal process can exist

without violating the principle of causality (or the micro-causality). 

On  the  one  hand,  according  to  the  quantum  field  theory,  the  spacelike  process 

mentioned above corresponds, in fact, to the virtual particle (the off-shell particle) process, 

which, as we have known, corresponds to the  longitudinal  polarization  or  scalar  photons.   

On  the  other  hand,  the  near-zone  fields  of  source  and  the  evanescent  waves  (also  as 

near-zone  fields)  involve  the  longitudinal  polarization  fields,  and,  as 

ﬁkr

  (i.e. 

exp(

)

1

),  the  fields  given  in  Equ.  5  are  the  same  as  those  produced  by  a  static 

electric  dipole  and  hence  correspond  to  the  virtual  photon  fields.    That  is  to  say,  the 

quasi-static  electric  fields  in  the  near-zone  of  source  correspond  to  the  spacelike  virtual 

photon fields, or equivalently, owing to the quantum effects (i.e. the position (z )-momentum 

(

zk

)  or 

time-energy  uncertainty)  operating 

remarkably  within 

the

of source, the spacelike virtual-photon processes would take place.    In 

conclusion, we propose that, the superluminal phenomena that are related to  the near-zone 

fields and the evanescent waves (also as the near-zone fields), correspond to the spacelike 

virtual-photon  processes,  consequently  the      superluminal  phenomena  in  nondispersive 

media  have  theoretical  foundation  in  QFT  (in  our  next  paper  we  shall  give  a  specific 

discussion in QFT level).

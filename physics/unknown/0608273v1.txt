Abstract 
 
In this paper the survival function of waiting times between orders and the corresponding trades in a 
double-auction market is studied both by means of experiments and of empirical data. It turns out 
that, already at the level of order durations, the survival function cannot be represented by a single 
exponential, thus ruling out the hypothesis of constant activity during trading. This fact has direct 
consequences  for  market  microstructural  models.  They  must  include  such  a  non-exponential 
behaviour to be realistic.

1. Introduction 
 
In  recent  times,  the  statistical  properties  of  high-frequency  financial  data  have  been  related  to 
market  microstructure  both  by  means  of  empirical  studies  and  agent-based  models  [1-7].  High-
frequency  econometrics is now  well  established after  research  on conditional  duration  models [8-
11], compound Poisson processes [12-14] and continous-time random walks [15-26] 
 
In high-frequency financial data not only returns but also waiting times between consecutive trades 
are random variables [27]. Already Lo and McKinlay [28] made this remark, but it can be traced at 
least to papers on the application of compound Poisson processes [29] and subordinated stochastic 
processes  to  finance  [30,31].  This  is  a  consequence  of  the  asynchronous  character  of  trading  in 
financial markets. Many regulated markets implement trading via the so-called continuous double-
auction where buyers and sellers send their orders at random times. These orders, including price 
and  quantity  (volume),  are  collected  in  a  book.  Depending  on  market  regulations,  traders  may 
submit  various  kinds  of  orders.  The  most  common  are  limit  orders:  orders  to  buy  a  specified 
quantity of a security at or below a given price, or to sell it at or above a given price (the limit price) 
and market orders: orders to buy or sell a specified quantity of a security at the best available price. 
When the best bid (buy order) and the best ask (sell order) match, a transaction (trade) takes place, 
securities are transferred from the seller to the buyer and money from the buyer to the seller. 
 
It  turns  out  that  compound  Poisson  processes  are  an  instance  of  continuous-time  random  walks 
(CTRWs)  [32].  The  application  of  CTRWs  to  problems  in  economics  dates  back,  at  least,  to  the 
1980s.  In  1984,  Rudolf  Hilfer  discussed  the  application  of  stochastic  processes  to  operational 
planning, and used CTRWs as tools for sale forecasts [33]. Already in 1903, the PhD thesis of Filip 

Lundberg  presented  a  model  for  ruin  theory  of  insurance  companies,  later  elaborated  by  Cramér 
[34,35].  The  stochastic  process  for  claims  is  another  example  of  compound  Poisson  process  and 
thus of CTRW. 
 
As  for  the  unconditional  distribution  of  intertrade  waiting  times,  a  priori,  there  is  no  reason  for 
independent market investors to place buy and sell orders in a time-correlated way. This argument 
would lead us to expect an exponential process for inter-order waiting times. Moreover, if the order 
selection  were  a  simple  thinning  of  the  order  process,  then  exponential  waiting  times  should  be 
expected  between  consecutive  trades  as  well  [36].  However,  it  turns  out  that  the  distribution  of 
intertrade waiting times does not follow the exponential law. This has been shown for the 30 DJIA 
stocks traded at NYSE in October 1999 [17,23,24], a remark also made by Engle and Russel [8].  
Results of many other independent research groups corroborate the finding that intertrade durations 
are  non-exponentially  distributed.  Plerou  et  al.  noticed  an  anomalous  behaviour  of  the  number  of 
transactions  over  a  given  time  interval  [37].  A  study  on  the  waiting  times  in  a  contemporary 
FOREX  exchange  and  in  the  XIXth  century  Irish  stock  market  was  presented  by  Sabatelli  et  al. 
[38]. They were able to fit the Irish data by means of a Mittag-Leffler function as Mainardi et al. did 
before in a paper on the waiting-time marginal distribution in the German Bund-future market [16]. 
Kim and Yoon studied the tick dynamical behavior of the bond futures in Korean Futures Exchange 
(KOFEX) market and found that the survival probability displays a stretched-exponential form [39]. 
This finding is also present in an empirical study of NYSE data [40]. Moreover, just to stress the 
relevance of non-exponential waiting times, a power-law distribution has been recently detected by 
T.  Kaizoji  and  M.  Kaizoji  in  analyzing  the  calm  time  interval  of  price  changes  in  the  Japanese 
market [41]. 
 
In this paper, we present results on the order selection process for a double auction for both well-
controlled experiments and for real market data. The main result of this paper is that also waiting-
times between consecutive orders do not follow the exponential distribution. 
 
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the experimental results. In Section 3, the 
empirical  analysis  on two LSE  stocks  traded  in 2002  is  presented.  Finally,  in  Section  4,  the main 
conclusions are discussed. 
 
2. Experimental results 
 
2.1 Method 
 
The experiments have been performed at the University of Innsbruck by two of us (Jürgen Huber 
and  Michael  Kirchler).  They  were  based  on  an  asymmetric  information  system.  Nine  traders 
(students of Economics at the University of Innsbruck) with different forecasting abilities trade for 
30 periods in a market that is a continuous double-auction. With 100 seconds for each period each 
session lasts 50 minutes. All parameters (especially interest rates and dividends) are set to let one 
period  in  the  experiment  correspond  to  one  month  in  a  real  market.  Each  trader  starts  the 
experiment  with  40  shares  and  1,600  units  of  cash.  This  allows  traders  to  buy  or  sell  shares 
depending on their expectations about the future development of dividends. In the double auction 
market, traders can freely sell or buy shares by placing limit orders or market orders by accepting 
open bids and asks from other traders. However, short selling was not allowed. 
 
The information structure of the market is such that agent (trader) Ij knows dividends for j periods, 
that is, agent I1 knows only the current dividend, agent I2 the dividends of this and the next period, 
and  so  on,  up  to  agent  I9  who  is  the  best  informed  trader.  Therefore,  in  this  market  there  are 

asymmetrically informed traders who are able to predict future cash flows to a different extent. This 
information structure is common knowledge. 

At  the  start  of  each  period,  subjects  get  information  on  future  dividends  according  to  their 
information  level.  In  addition  we  display  to  each  trader  the  net  present  value  of  the  stock  given 
his/her information. This is derived using Gordon’s formula, discounting the known dividends and 
using the last one as a continuous, infinite stream which is also discounted.

  stands  for  the  conditional  expected  value  of  the  asset  in  period  k,  j  represents  the 
index for the information level of the traders, and re is the risk adjusted interest rate in period k. As 
we can see from equation (1), the dividend in (k+j-1), namely the last dividend known to trader j is 
assumed  to  remain  constant  for  an  infinite  number  of  periods.  All  the  other  dividends  are  also 
discounted  with  re.  The  resulting  paths  of  the  conditional  expected  values  of  the  asset  for  odd 
information levels with k=30 periods in our experimental treatment are shown in Figure 1.

Beginning  with  I9  the  functions  in  Figure  1  are  shifted  for  each  information  level  Ij  by  
(9-j) periods to the right, showing a main characteristic of our model, namely that better informed 
traders receive information earlier than less informed ones. So, information on the intrinsic value of 
the company that trader I9 sees in one period is seen by trader I8 one period later, and by trader I1 
eight periods later, giving the better informed an informational advantage. For more details on the 
design, see reference [42].  
 
2.1 Results 
 
Six experiments have been performed so far. The results for the survival probability function:

are given in Figure 2, both for orders and trades, and compared with the exponential distribution. A 
visual  inspection  shows  that  at  least  in  five  of  six  cases,  the  measured  data  do  not  follow  the 
exponential distribution.

As we have argued above, in the presence of constant activity in the market, the survival function is 
an exponential function:

0t   is  the  average  duration.  It  can  be  shown  that,  if  the  waiting  times  between  two 
where 
consecutive events follow the exponential distribution then the number n of events in a given time 
interval is a random variable characterized by the Poisson distribution.  
 
Indeed,  the  probability  P(n,t)  of  having  n  events  from  time  t 000  =  0  up  to  time  t  is  given  by  the 
following convolution:

Moreover, the exponential distribution is the only memoryless distribution for a point process (Cox, 
1979). Therefore, it is natural to test the empirical survival function against the above exponential 
model. A suitable statistical test is the Anderson-Darling (AD) test [43]. In order to perform the test, 
the statistics A2 is computed according to the following rule: 
 
 
 
where t1 £ t2 £ … £ tn. 
 
In Table 1, the values of the AD 
these cases the null hypothesis of exponentially distributed waiting times can be rejected at the 1 % 
significance level (the limiting value is 1.957). These values are compared with those that can be 
obtained from exponentially distributed waiting times. The results of experimental market 3 are 
closer to the exponential.

3.1 The LSE data 
 
The  waiting-time  data  have  been  extracted  from  the  historical  database  of  the  London  Stock 
Exchange where orders and quotes are stored for the electronic market; these data are a significant 
fraction, but do not include all the orders and quotes. Our data set consists of waiting times between 
orders  and  trades  for  both  Glaxo  Smith  Kline  (GSK)  and  Vodafone  (VOD)  stocks  traded  in  the 
following months: March, June, and October 2002. Nearly 800,000 orders and 540,000 trades have 
been  analyzed.  Both  limit  and  market  orders  have  been  included.  For  orders  and  trades  of  each 
stock,  the  average  waiting  times  and  the  standard  deviations  are  given  in  Table  2  below.  The 
difference  between  these  two  values already  points  to a  non-exponential distribution  of durations. 
The use of one-month high-frequency data is a trade-off between the necessity of managing enough 
data for significant statistical analyses and, on the other hand, the goal of minimizing the effect of 
external economic fluctuations. 
 
3.2 The Anderson-Darling test on the survival function 
 
2A  statistics are given for all the six monthly data sets (three for 
In Table 2, the values of the AD 
each  company).  Again,  in  all  these  cases  the  null  hypothesis  of  exponentially  distributed  waiting 
times can be rejected at the 1 % significance level (the limiting value is 1.957). It is therefore safe to 
conclude that the survival function for waiting times for both orders and trades is non-exponential. 
The  last  two  columns  of  Table  2  show  that  there  is  significant  excess  standard  deviation  in  the 
distribution of waiting times, a result that corroborates the rejection of the null hypothesis.

4. Discussion and conclusions 
 
In  this  paper,  we  have  shown  that  not  only  waiting  times  between  consecutive  trades  are  non-
exponentially  distributed,  but  the  anomalous  behaviour  is  also  shared  by  waiting  times  between 
consecutive  orders.  This  property  is  not  only  present  in  real  market  data,  such  as  the  LSE  data 
studied here, but also in market experiments as shown in Section 2. The experiments demonstrate 
that  variable  activity  during  trading  is  present  also  on  quite  short  time  scales  (each  experimental 
period lasts 100 seconds). 
 
This has direct consequences for market microstructural models. To be realistic, such models must 
include  a  variable  activity  yielding  a  non-exponential  behaviour.  Double-auction  market 
simulations with constant activity [44,45] fail to take into account this feature and might miss subtle 
but  important  effects  related  to  non-constant  trader  activity.  Including  the  anomaly  in  a  double-
auction market mechanism is easy and leads to promising and interesting results [46]. Muchnik and 
Solomon  have  developed  a  computing  framework  which  naturally  takes  into  account  the 
asynchronous character of trading in a financial market [47]. 
 
Recently, Barabási has argued that the timing of many human activities is described by non-Poisson 
statistics, characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events followed by more relaxed periods [48]. 
In this paper we have provided clear evidence that this is precisely the case in a financial market, 
already at the level of the order process in a continuous double-auction. 

[Fig3 here] 

 

 

 

 

 
Scalas et al. have provided a simple phenomenological way of taking into account variable human 
activity in a financial market in terms of exponential mixtures [23]. Suppose that the trading period 
can be divided into N intervals of constant activity and characterized by average durations (cid:1)01, …, 
(cid:1)0N. Then the survival function can be written as a weighted sum of exponentials:

. In general, the survival function given in equation (9) exhibits a 

significant deviation from the simple exponential behaviour for intermediate waiting times and can 
mimic the presence of heavy tails in the distribution of waiting times. For instance, in the simple 
case where the survival function is given by: 
 
( )
=Y
t
 
it is straightforward to show that the standard deviation is greater than the average value of the 
waiting times [49]. In fact, one has:

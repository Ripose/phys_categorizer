New mathematical formulation of liquidity preference theory is suggested. On the base of comparison between suggested
model and real prices paradoxical conclusion could be derived. The whole yield curve could be described only on the base
of liquidity preference theory without any consideration of risk-neutral models.

ABSTRACT

Keywords: Liquidity preference; Portfolio theory; Yield curve.

One  of  the  existing  problems  in  the  theory  of  mathematical  finance  is  the  calculation  of  term

structure of interest rates. The term structure of interest rates is determined by the dependence of the yield

of the discount instruments from maturity.

There are many different models explaining the relationship between long- and short-term interest

rates [1]. One of the most popular is the liquidity preference theory. This theory states that  forward rates

should  be  higher  than  future  spot  rates.  This  means  that  long-term  buyers  of  bonds  require  additional

return. Let’s rephrase our statements in such a way so that it would be similar to concepts from portfolio

theory  (return  connected  with  risk).  So,  we  could  assume  that  holders  of  long-term  securities  receive

additional return compared  with  holders of short-term securities because of  the  additional  risk  associated

with long-term securities. Because of the resemblance of this statement to the portfolio theory, we could try

to apply powerful mechanisms of portfolio analysis in order to calculate the yield curve.

We  could  formulate  again  that  the  purpose  of  this  paper  is  the  mathematical  formulation  of

liquidity  preference  theory  on  the  base  of  similarity  of  concepts,  underlying  this  theory  with  portfolio

analysis.

theoretical concepts:

return, or

In  order  to  write  an  equation  for  yield  calculation  we  will  apply  the  following  important

1.  Markowitz portfolio theory for connection between risk and return [2].

2.  Value-at-risk concept for measuring risk [3].

3.  Creation of riskless portfolio as a tool for obtaining riskless return [1].

The  simplest  reformulation  of  liquidity  preference  theory  is:  additional  risk  requires  additional

                                  Additional Return = α * Additional Risk

 (1)

Now we will try to elaborate our statement on the base of concepts from the modern theory of

finance, mentioned above. The remaining part article consists of the following parts:

1.  How we are going to calculate additional return.

2.  What is the reason for additional risk and how are we going to calculate it.

3.  Final form of the basic equation and its solution.

4.  Comparison of empirical prices with obtained equation.

5.  Correspondence between suggested approach and portfolio theory.

6.  Conclusion.

1.  How we are going to calculate additional return.

We will define additional return as the difference between the market price of bond(Pr) and the price of

the bond, calculated from riskless approach(E):

                   

                            Additional return = E - 

rP ,                                                  (2)

(E  - 

rP   ,  not 

rP -  E).  The  following  order  becomes  clearer  if  we  write  down  an  additional  return  as

difference between the return for a real bond and return in the risk-neutral world:

Additional return = Return for bond - Return for bond in risk-neutral world.                (3)

Consider  I   as  the  value  of  all  cash  flows,  connected  with  the  bond  at  the  time  of  maturity,  we

could define the terms in (3) as:

Return for bond =  I  – Pr,

Return for bond in risk-neutral world =  I  - E,

     (4)

Because of (3) and (4) additional return could be written as:

                                     

 Additional return = ( I  - Pr) – ( I  - E),                        

       (5)

and we could immediately see that (2) and (5) are the same equations. The calculation of additional risk,

however, is much more difficult.

2.  What is the reason for additional risk and how we are going to calculate it.

It’s  possible  to  suggest  many  reasons  for  risks,  existing  even  if  we  use  the  usual  risk  -  neutral

framework. First of all, it could be transaction costs (or more general - market could be incomplete). Then,

it  could  be  imprecision  of  used  risk-neutral  models  or  the  existence  of  many  of  them.  And,  of  course,  it

could be  the  usual  arguments  for  liquidity  preference  theory.  In  this  explanation,  additional  risk  depends
not only on volatility  σ, but also on time to maturity. We need some additional quantitative concept for

measuring  this  additional  risk.  All  of  the  following  reasons  could  lead  to  deviation  from  the  risk-neutral

approach and to the existence of additional risk.

In  order  to  estimate  an  additional  risk  we  will  use  Value-at-Risk  concept  developed  at  J.  P.

Morgan ([3]). According to this concept, Value-at-Risk (VaR) is equal to the difference between average

expected price at time T (time of maturity) and price of instrument that differentiate probability space in a

special  way(such  that,  the  integral  probability  to  be  below  the  average  expected  price  of  this  instrument

would be n%, where n=1,2,3). Now, we will specify equation for interest-rate security

3.  Final form of basic equation (connection between additional risk and additional return and its

solution).

There is, however, one small problem, that needs to be solved in order to write final version of

equation (1) (connection between additional risk and additional return). The problem is the following:

payoff for additional risk happened immediately at time t = 0(additional return), but this risk is calculated at

time of maturity( at t = T, Fig.1):

F ig .1 T im e d iag ra m  fo r ad d itio nal ris k and  ad d itio nal return. 

A dditional R eturn at t=0

A dditional R isk at t= T

We need to find way to determine additional risk and additional return at the same time. In order to do this

we need to find way to discount additional risk from time t= T to time t=0. Because the value of additional

risk is money, we could suggest two discount procedures:

1.  Additional Risk(t=0) = 

 Additional Risk(t = T)

2. Additional Risk ( t = 0)  = 

 Additional Risk(t = T)

The first statement from (10) corresponds to usual risk-neutral approach and the second to the self-

agreeable discount procedure( if the value of  I  (at time at present time costs Pr, then the value of additional

risk at present time costs (Pr/ I )*Additional Risk ( t = T) ). From this point on we will consider only the

second approach. Finally, equation (1) could be rewritten as:

Equations (12), (18), (22), and derived from them equations (21) and (24) allow us to compare this model

with existing financial data. We will use data from Federal Reserve Statistical Release [6] from 04/12/99

for U.S. treasury constant maturities.

The data (yields) in percents per annum are presented in table 1.

4.  Possible strong hypothesis about relationship between observed and risk-neutral interest rates

and comparison with existing financial data.

In order to compare obtained result with financial data we need model for calculating y (t) and

another parameters from (12). One of the most extreme hypothesis could suggest that

Because of it we will be able to try to compare obtained time dependencies (21) and (24) with yields,

y0(t) = constant = y0

(25)

To do this, we compare data from table (1) and suggested dependencies (21) – for small times and (24) –

obtaining from bond prices.

for big times.

Let’s first of all discuss comparison between suggested financial data and formula (21): If we

choose γ in (21) equal to 1, than formula (21) could be rewritten as:

In order to compare suggested function with financial data we will build chart of dependence y from

It’s clear from this dependence that there is a reasonably good agreement between suggested formula (26)

and actual dependence y(t). From this graphic (Fig.2) we could determine coefficients in formula (26): y0
and αβσ :

y0  =  0.004, and αβσ = 0.66*10-2 

(27)

Now we could try to  compare (24) with data from table 1. In order to do it we will introduce some

additional assumptions: 

e =µ

const

, and 

e =µ

0y

 - there is only one rate of return and this rate is equal

to y0.

Now, assuming that 

e

t

 is small enough for last 2 existing values( 20 years and 30 years)

we could simplify (24) and write it as:

Using values of y for these two times to maturity (20 and 30 years), and knowing that y0 = 0.004, we could

determine(Fig.3) :

Now, because we know α ( 1.18   ) and αβσ ( 0.66*10-2 ), it's possible to compare coefficients  βσ

from (28) with coefficients  βσ, obtained from (27) and (29) (

It’s clear from these data that difference between existing price and price, calculated on the base of

suggested model is no more than 5%. Even additional precision in parameters’ estimation could decrease

this difference. In addition, for better correspondence between observed data and suggested model, it’s

possible to relax the following assumptions:

5.   Portfolio theory, risk - neutral model and interest - rate models.

Here we will show relationship between existing financial models and suggested way for mathematical

formulation of liquidity preference theory.

Let's point out again, that choosing of VaR as risk measure, allow us to evaluate risk for different

maturities.

Additional return could be calculated as difference between risk - neutral price ( price, calculated

on the base of risk - neutral model and market price). To connect return and risk for different maturities  we

will use relationship between risk and return, similar to portfolio theory. Finally, we will express suggested

formalism, using graphical view:

Formula   connected   with   portfolio   theory  =

,

 (Formula, connected with risk - neutral valuation) /

(Formula, connected with VaR);

6.   Conclusion.

New mathematical formulation of liquidity preference theory is suggested. On the base of comparison

between suggested model and real prices paradoxical conclusion could be derived. All yield curve could be

described only on the base of liquidity preference theory without any consideration of risk-neutral models.

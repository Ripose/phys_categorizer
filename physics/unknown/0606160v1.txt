We reveal that lattice interfaces imprinted in nonlocal nonlinear media support surface 

solitons  that  do  not  exist  in  other  similar  settings,  including  interfaces  of  local  and 

nonlocal  uniform  materials.  We  show  the  impact  of  nonlocality  on  the  domains  of 

existence  and  stability  of  the  surface  solitons,  focusing  on  new  types  of  dipole  solitons 

residing  partially  inside  the  optical  lattice.  We  find  that  such  solitons  feature  strongly 

asymmetric shapes and that they are stable in large parts of their existence domain.

Nonlinear surface waves localized at the very interface between two optical media 

continuously  attract  attention  because  of  their  rich  physical  properties  [1-3].  However, 

the  high  light  intensity  levels  required  for  their  excitation  at  interfaces  of  natural 

materials  prevented  their  experimental  observation  in  many  cases.  Recently,  in  a 

landmark advance, surface waves were observed experimentally in engineered interfaces 

made between a uniform medium and a waveguide array in AlGaAs [4,5]. Actually, such 

structures  are  a  particular  case  of  a  general  type  of  interfaces  formed  at  the  edge  of  a 

semi-infinite optical lattice imprinted in a nonlinear medium, which support novel types 

of surface solitons [6,7]. In this Letter we address the impact of a nonlocal nonlinearity 

on the properties of surface solitons supported by optical lattice interfaces. 

We thus study nonlinear surface waves supported by a semi-infinite optical lattice 

imprinted  in  a  nonlocal  nonlinear  medium.  Nonlocality  of  the  nonlinear  response  is  a 

characteristic  feature  of  many  nonlinear  materials  including  semiconductors,  liquid 

crystals  and  photorefractive  materials  [8-10].  Nonlocality  is  known  to  drastically  alter 

the  soliton  properties  (see  [11]  for  an  overview),  for  example  by  having  a  strong 

stabilizing  action  [12].  Remarkably,  nonlocality  results  in  the  formation  of  stable 

complex  solitons,  such  us  multi-pole  solitons  [13-17].  Here  we  reveal  that  a  nonlocal

nonlinearity  makes  possible  the  existence  of  a  new  type  of  surface  solitons  at  lattice 

interfaces that do not exist at other physical settings, such us local interface or interface 

of nonlocal uniform materials. We find dipole surface lattice solitons that turn out to be 

strongly  asymmetric  but  still  stable,  keeping  their  internal  structure  upon  propagation 

even in the presence of considerable broadband perturbations. 

We  consider  propagation  of  a  paraxial  laser  beam  along  the  ξ  axis  at  the 

interface of semi-infinite periodic lattice imprinted in a nonlocal nonlinear medium. Light 

propagation  is  described  by  the  system  of  equations  for  the  field  amplitude q  and  the 

nonlinear contribution to refractive index n :

describes the profile of a semi-infinite lattice with frequency  Ω ; the parameter d  stands 

for  the  degree  of  nonlocality  of  the  nonlinear  response.  Such  lattices  can  be  imprinted, 

e.g. in liquid crystals, by applying a proper voltage to the boundaries of elongated cells, 

as demonstrated in Ref. [9]. In such systems, nonlocality appears due to reorientational  

nonlinearity  (i.e.,  a  variation  of  the  orientation  of  the  liquid  crystal  molecules  in  one 

location  causes  a  reorientation  of  the  molecules  in  other  parts  of  the  crystal)  and  its 

degree  can  be  tuned  externally  [8].  Notice  that  an  applied  voltage  may  also  cause 

periodic variation in the nonlocality degree at  η

0>

: however, for the sake of generality 

here  we  consider  the  simplified  model  (1).  Semiconductors  possessing  nonlocal 

nonlinearities  are  promising  candidates  for  fabrication  of  lattice  interfaces,  too.  The 

system  (1)  describes  a  local  nonlinear  response  at  d

→

0

 and  a  strongly  nonlocal 

response at d

→ ∞

. Similar material equations were used to study surface waves at the 

interface  of  uniform  diffusive  media  and  it  was  shown  that  nonlocality  increases  the 

energy threshold for surface wave formation and in general makes their excitation more 

difficult, especially when diffusion occurs through the interface [18,19].

We found that the simplest ground-state surface solitons supported by the lattice 

interface  reside  in  the  first  lattice  channel,  where  the  field  amplitude  reaches  its 

maximum value (see Figs. 1(a) and 1(b)). To illustrate the properties of the solitons, we

solitons  monotonically  increases  with b  everywhere  except  for  a  narrow  region  close  to 

the cutoff b

 for soliton existence, where the derivative dU

/db

 becomes negative (this 

region  is  not  even  visible  in  the U b  dependence  depicted  in  Fig.  2(a)).  As  b

lowb→
solitons penetrate deeper inside the lattice and oscillations on their profile become more 

( )

 

pronounced. For large values of b , the soliton energy concentrates almost completely in 

the first lattice channel. In the regime of strong nonlocality the width of the refractive 

index  profile  substantially  exceeds  the  soliton  width,  and  hence  there  are  almost  no 

oscillations  on  the n

 curve.  The  cutoff b

 monotonically  increases  with  p  (see  Fig. 

low

2(b)),  and  only  slightly  increases  with  the  nonlocality  degree  d .  As  in  the  case  of 

interface between uniform diffusive media [18], increasing the nonlocality strength results 

in  an  increase  of  the  threshold  surface  wave  energy  U

The central finding reported in this Letter is that lattice interfaces imprinted in 

nonlocal media support dipole solitons, comprising two out-of-phase poles that reside at 

different  sides  of  the  interface  (see  Fig.  1(c)  and  1(d)).  The  poles  of  such  solitons  are 

glued  together  because  in  nonlocal  media  the  correction  to  the  refractive  index  is 

determined  by  the  light  intensity  distribution  in  the  entire  transverse  plane,  so  that 

equilibrium  configurations  of  out-of-phase  beams  are  possible  for  a  proper  separation 

between  them.  Due  to  the  presence  of  the  interface  dipole  surface  solitons  are  strongly 

asymmetric: multiple oscillations develop on the soliton profile at  η

>

0

, while at  η

0<

 

the  field  distribution  is  smooth.  The  asymmetry  of  the  dipole  solitons  increases  with 

lattice  depth  and  with  the  nonlocality  degree.  Importantly,  note  that  such  solitons  do 

not exist at interfaces of an optical lattice and a uniform medium with local nonlinearity. 

We  did  not  find  such  solutions  in  interfaces  made  in  uniform  media,  i.e.,  latticeless 

nonlocal  media  where  the  refractive  index  profile  is  described  by  a  step-like  function 

( )R η

. Namely, our code did not converge to a solution residing at the interface for any 

of  the  numerous  trial  functions  that  we  used.  Thus,  we  conclude  that  the  lattice  is  a 

necessary ingredient for the existence of the dipole surface solitons described here. 

We  found  that  dipole  surface  lattice  solitons  exhibit  lower  b

low

 and  upper  b

 

upp

cutoffs  for  existence.  As b

lowb→

 the  asymmetry  of  the  soliton  poles  increases.  This  is 

because the right soliton pole substantially expands into the lattice region, while the left 

pole moves deeper into the uniform medium (Fig. 1(c)). Still, even small-amplitude right 

poles  keep  high-amplitude  left  poles  glued  to  the  interface.  At b

→

uppb

 dipole  surface 

solitons  become  less  asymmetric  (Fig.  1(d)).  The  energy  flow  is  a  monotonically 

increasing  function  of  b  except  for  narrow  regions  near  both  lower  and  upper  cutoffs 

where 

dU db ≤
/

0

 (Fig.  2(c)).  The  domain  of  existence  of  dipole  solitons  gradually 

shrinks  with  increase  of  lattice  depth  (Fig.  2(d)).  In  contrast,  the  upper  cutoff  first 

decreases and then increases with d , resulting in a substantial expansion of the existence 

domain  in  strongly  nonlocal  media  (Fig.  2(e)).  This  is  because  the  lower  cutoff  (not 

shown) changes with d  only slightly (thus, at 

p =

1

 one has b

1.3≈

).

A detailed linear stability analysis of the above stationary solutions revealed that 

dipole surface solitons can be stable in large part of their existence domain. Stabilization

.  Dipoles  are  stable  for

 and  oscillatory  unstable  for  b

.  Figure  2(f)  shows  the 

dependence of the perturbation growth rate on b . With an increase of the lattice depth 

cr
uppb

or the nonlocality degree, b  gradually approaches b

 (see Fig. 2(d) and 2(e)). Notice 

upp

cr

that in the strongly nonlocal regime a narrow instability domain emerges also near the 

lower  cutoff.  The  new  domain  gradually  expands  with  increasing  d .  Direct  numerical

broadband  random  perturbation,  always  confirmed  the  results  by  the  linear  stability 

analysis.  Illustrative  propagations  of  perturbed  stable  fundamental  and  dipole  surface 

solitons are shown in Fig. 3. Notice that strong perturbation can cause small oscillations 

of  the  distance  between  the  poles  of  the  dipole  solitons,  as  observable  in  Fig.  3(b). 

However, the surface lattice solitons remain robust. 

 

We thus summarize by stressing that we reported on the existence of new type of 

complex  surface  solitons  supported  by  the  interface  of  a  periodic,  finite  optical  lattice 

imprinted  in  a  nonlocal  nonlinear  medium.  Our  findings  indicate  that  nonlocality  and 

the  refractive  index  modulation  in  the  lattice  region  are  necessary  ingredients  for  the 

existence of surface dipoles that remain stable in spite of their strong shape asymmetry.

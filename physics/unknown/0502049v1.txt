Scaling Laws for the Speed of Light and the Cosmological Constant from 
Coincidences in the Critical Acceleration

ABSTRACT 

There are at least two distinct and compelling cosmological coincidences associated with the value 
of  critical  acceleration  below  which  Newtonian  dynamics  are  suspected  to  fail  to  represent  Nature.    The 
most plausible resolution of this coincidence problem naturally leads to scaling laws for the speed of light 
and the cosmological constant. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
One  interpretation  of  the  inability  of  Newtonian  mechanics  to  model  dynamical 
behavior  of  the  known  matter  in  galaxies  and  clusters  is  that  there  exists  a  critical 
acceleration  a0~10-10m/s2  below  which  the  laws  of  mechanics  require  some  yet-
unascertained  modification.    While  laboratory  investigations  of  the  behavior  of 
mechanical  systems  under  minute  accelerations  are  exceptionally  difficult,  the  cosmos 
has  conveniently  displayed  before  us  hundreds  of  billions  of  systems  bound  by  weak 
accelerations.    Significant  portions  of  galaxies  and  clusters  of  galaxies  are  typically 
bound by accelerations of order less than a0 and are well known to feature motions that 
may  not  be  explained  by  Newtonian  mechanics  without  the  introduction  of  invisible 
mass.    Such  systems  are  also  well  modeled  by  certain  modifications  of  the  laws  of 
dynamics below the critical acceleration, such as presented in the MOND theory. 
 
The inability to describe virtually all known systems of bodies being accelerated 
by  an  amount  less  than  ~10-10m/s2  is  particularly  noteworthy  since  this  critical 
acceleration  is  coincidentally  close  to  the  current  value  of  H0c  with  H0~10-18m/s2.  
Presumably the laws of mechanics have been virtually constant through history, allowing 
the  formation  of  structures  throughout  the  epochs.    At  earlier  times  the  critical 
acceleration  must  have  been  close  to  its  current  value  but  the  Hubble  acceleration  at 
earlier times would have been quite different. 

It  will  be  shown  that  there  at  least  two  distinct  and  physically  significant  large 
number coincidences involving the critical acceleration.  The most natural resolution to 
these improbable alignments readily leads to scaling laws for the speed of light and the 
cosmological constant. 
2. Two coincidences in the critical acceleration 
The best available characterizations of the observed cosmological expansion and 
 
acceleration  histories  are  provided  by  the  Friedmann  (FRLW)  equations  applied  to  the 
standard Lambda-CDM cosmology

in which  a is the scale factor, G is the gravitation constant, p is the radiation pressure,  ρ 
is the mass density of the Universe and  Λ  is the cosmological constant.  The radiation 
pressure  will  henceforth  be  treated  as  negligible  since  the  calculations  will  involve  the 
current  epoch  in  which  matter  and  vacuum  density  are  the  dominant  terms.    The  two 
coincidences  associated  with  the  critical  acceleration  a0  will  be  obtained  from  Eqs.  (1) 
and (2) respectively. 

Let the cosmological terms with the subscript naught refer to quantities evaluated

at the exact moment when

Consideration  of  a  second  coincidence  involving  the  critical  acceleration  and 
cosmological terms is motivated by Eq. (2).  Multiplying Eq. (2) by a distance gives the 
actual cosmological acceleration between any two bodies separated by that distance.  If 
that distance were the radius of curvature of the Universe at some given time then Eq. (2) 
would give the characteristic cosmological acceleration of the Universe at that time.  At 
  the  deceleration  of  gravity  equals  the  acceleration  of  the 
the  moment  when 
cosmological constant and both happen to be of order the critical acceleration:

3. A physical significance 
 
The two distinct coincidences expressed in Eqs. (5) and (7) each involve terms of 
real physical meaning motivated from relativistic cosmology.  While it may be plausible 
to allow for one such coincidence involving the critical acceleration in a cosmos already 
teetering  on  the  brink  of  implausibility,  it  is  exceeding  unlikely  to  expect  that  both 
compelling  large  number  alignments  involving  the  same  terms  are  coincidental.    It  is 

therefore reasonable to suspect that the distinct relationships in Eqs. (5) and (7) are in fact 
physically  equivalent.    If  that  should  be  the  case  then  it  must  be  that  the  consequential 
relationship

This  well  known  coincidence  appears  in  Sciama’s  gravitomagnetic  formulation  and  is 
also  suggestive  of  some  relationship  between  the  rest  energy  of  any  mass  and  its 
gravitational potential energy with respect to the Universe.

This relationship is indeed satisfied and such a scaling for the cosmological constant has 
been  suggested  in  the  context  of  other  theoretical  motivations.    However,  note  that  its 
appearance  in  the  present  analysis  is  purely  the  consequence  of  the  simple  supposition 
that the two large-number alignments involving critical accelerations are not coincidental.

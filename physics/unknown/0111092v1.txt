Abstract 

 

The  Storage  Ring  at  the  Advanced  Light  Source  is 
capable of being filled in selectable buckets. Typically, 
276  consecutive  buckets  out  of  328  possible  are 
selected.  It  has  been  found  that  the  amount  of  charge 
injected  is  not  uniform  bucket-to-bucket,  sometimes 
varying  by  100%  or  more.  This  variability  causes 
problems  with  beam  stability,  and  it  may  shorten  the 
beam lifetime. We have devised a feedback system that 
allows for beam filling in an orderly manner, yielding 
bunch  heights  uniform  to  within  17%.  At  fill  time, 
multiple  bunches  are  injected  into  the  Storage  ring 
first, then, using feedback, selected single bunches are 
used to top off the fill.

1 INTRODUCTION 
The  Storage  Ring  beam  is  monitored  by  a  BPM  in 
summing  mode  and  wired  into  the  control  room  to  a 
Tektronix  TDS  784A  oscilloscope.  A  GPIB  interface 
connects  the  scope  signal  to  a  Labview  program, 
Ogetwave.vi1, running on a PC. This program detects 
the  bunch  stream,  processes  the  information,  and 
periodically  stores  the  file  on  a  server.  Another 
runs 
program  written 
simultaneously,

the  bunch  data.  This 
analyzing  and  processing 
program  contains  an  algorithm  which  uses 
the 
individual  bunch  heights  as  feedback  and  selectively 
fills  each  of  them  according  to  how  much  charge  is 
required  to  bring  them  up  to  an  even  height  while 
filling the storage ring to a current of 393 mA. Then a 
“camshaft”  bucket  is  automatically  filled  to  10mA  in 
the dead space after the bunch train. By this time this 
last  step  is  finished,  it  is  assumed  the  multibunch 
buckets  have  decayed  a  few  milliamps,  bringing  the 
total current to 400mA.

2 FILLING THE STORAGE RING 
 
The  ring  is  filled  using  a  graphic  method  of  bucket 
selection  (see  Fig.  3).  The  start  and  end  buckets  are 
specified, as well as the pattern of spacing and cycles 

that  are  made  necessary  by  the  8  nanosecond  spacing 
of  gun  bunches  compared  with  the  2  nanosecond 
spacing of storage ring buckets. The 276 bucket filling 
sequence is begun with target buckets 1, 13, 25. . . and 
intervening  numbers  filled  in  by  the  3  gun  bunches. 
I.e.,  when  bucket  1  is  targeted,  buckets  5  and  9  are 
automatically filled, because of the three gun bunches. 
After the first part of the cycle is complete and target 
bucket  265  has  been  reached,  the  pattern  starts  over 
with 2, 14, 26, . ., then 3, 15, 27, . . ., and finally 4, 
16,  28,  .  .  ..  Thus  all  buckets  are  filled  once.    In  the 
case  of  non-optimized  fills,  this  procedure  would  run 
freely, repeating as many times as necessary to achieve 
393  mA,  starting  and  ending  at  unpredictable  target 
buckets. Since it would not have filled each bucket the 
same  number  of  times,  and  the  fact  that  each  bucket 
would  have  received  unpredictable  amounts  of  beam 
on each shot, the fill would be uneven. See Figure 2. 
 

 

3 OPTIMIZATION 

encountered  when  observing 

The  solution  to  the  uneven  fill  is  to  regulate  the 
amount  of  charge  in  each  bucket.  One  problem 
immediately 
the 
oscilloscope  trace  and  the  digitized  version  of  it  on 
SRInject.exe, is that there is a distortion of the heights 
of  isolated  bunches,  or  bunches  that  are  significantly 
higher  than  their  neighbors,  apparently  due  to  a 
cabling mismatch. At this time, no hardware solution 
of  this  problem  has  been  found,  so  a  formula  for 
compensation  of  this  error  has  been  derived  in 
software.  This  formula  makes  use  of  the  fact  that  the 
inversely 
increased  height  of  a  given  bunch 
proportional  to  the  height  of  the  bunch  immediately 
preceding it. If the preceding bunch is zero, the height 
of  the  bunch  is  greater  by  an  error,  e,  and  the 
cI ,  of  the  bunch  in  question  is 
compensated  height,

At  fill  time,  the  Storage  Ring  current  has  decayed 
by  about  one  halflife,  i.e.,  to  about  200  mA.  At  this 
point  the  standard  multibunch  fil l  is  executed  for  N 
cycles,  i.e.,  each  of  the  276  buckets  is  targeted  N 
times. Next, a determination is made whether there is 
room  for  another  cycle.  If  not,  the  gun  output  is 
reduced  so  that  the  next  cycle  fills  to  just  under  the 
nominal  fill  point  of  393   mA,  or  a  threshold  level 
tV ) of 1.42 mA per bucket. To derive the proper gun 
(
output,  its  output  was  graphed  as  a  function  of  grid 
bias. The graph is a typical triode curve (see Figure 1.) 
To obtain the reduced gun output, y, the gun  grid bias 
is increased until

just a few strokes minimizes operator errors as the fill 
is repeated throughout the week.

4 THE CAMSHAFT BUCKET 

 
In  the  final  phase  of  filling,  the  feedba ck  scheme 
described above is also used to inject a camshaft bunch 
to  a  value  of  10  mA.  This  bunch  is  used  for  precise 
timing  of  certain  experiments,  e.g.,  chemical 
dynamics, but its separation from and unequal charge 
with the other bunches is transparent t o other users. 

All phases of filling can be done while observing a 
dynamic  display  of  the  buckets  being  filled  as  a  bar 
graph,  with  the  possibility  of  selecting  an  individual 
bucket and reading its height.

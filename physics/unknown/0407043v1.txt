Abstract 
Irradiation  of  cell  monolayers  by  monoenergetic  ions  has  made  it  possible  to 
establish  survival  curves  at  individual  values  of  linear  energy  transfer.  The  two-step 
model of radiobiological  mechanism proposed recently by Judas and Lokajicek (Judas 
L.,  Lokajicek  M.,  2001:  Cell  inactivation  by  ionizing  particles  and  the  shapes  of 
survival  curves.  J.  Theor.  Biol.  210  (1),  15-21.,  doi:10.1006/jtbi.2001.2283)  has  then 
enabled  to  show  that  some  significant  deviations  from  the  generally  used  linear-
quadratic model should exist at higher values of linear energy transfer, which has been 
also demonstrated experimentally. However, the new model has been expressed in the 
form being  applicable rightfully to low-dose parts of survival  curves only. It has been 
now  reformulated  to  be  applicable  in  analyses  of  whole  survival  curves.  Inactivation 
probabilities  after  different  numbers  of  particles  traversing  cell  nuclei  (chromosomal 
systems)  may  be  then  derived  from  experimental  data.  Analyses  of  published  data 
obtained in irradiating by protons and deuterons will be presented and discussed.

1. Introduction 
Radiotherapy  of  tumours  increases  its  potential  by  using  accelerated  protons  and 
other  ions.  However,  efficient  use  of  these  new  irradiation  modes  requires  detailed 
knowledge  of  inactivation  characteristics  at  different  parts  of  ion  tracks.  Physical 
parameters  of  beam  particles,  e.g.  their  linear  energy  transfer  (LET)  values,  are 
changing significantly especially in their Bragg regions. The corresponding inactivation 
characteristics  may  be  derived  from  experiments  in  which  cell  monolayers  are  being 
irradiated by monoenergetic ions. 

The  ratio  of  surviving  cells  in  dependence  on  applied  dose  d  is  being  expressed 

generally as

It  has  been  shown  by  Judas  and  Lokajicek  (2001)  that  at  higher  LET  values  and 
especially  in  low-dose  regions  the  survival  curves  must  exhibit  significant  deviations 
from  the  predictions  of  the  standard  LQ  model,  which  has  been  demonstrated  also 
experimentally  in  an  independent  way,  see  Schettino  et  al.  (2001).  The  corresponding 
deviations exhibited also the earlier data presented by Belli et al. (1998) and Folkard et

al. (1996), which was, however, regarded earlier always as the consequence of statistical 
experimental errors. 

The  formulation  of  the  model  in  (Judas  and  Lokajicek  2001),  indicating  the 
deviations from the LQ model, has enabled to apply it to the low-dose part of survival 
curves at rather high LET values only. The contemporary approach makes it possible to 
apply  the  model  to  whole  survival  curves  practically  for  all  not-low  LET  radiation 
kinds.  In  Sec. 2  the  basic  features  of  the  given  two-step  model  will  be  described  and 
consequences  following  for  the  low-dose  parts  of  survival  curves  will  be  shown. 
Mathematical  formulation  allowing  the  model  to  be  applied  to  whole  survival  curves 
will  be  described  in  Sec. 3  and  the  possibilities  how  to  establish  the  corresponding 
inactivation  characteristics  will  be  discussed.  In  Sec. 4  the  model  will  be  applied  to 
experimental survival curves established in different parts of proton and deuteron track 
ends,  which  have  been  published  in  the  literature.  The  results  will  be  discussed  in 
Sec. 5. Some concluding remarks will be given in Sec. 6. 

 
2. Inactivation of individual cells and the two-step model 
If the dose is delivered to cell population in a time shorter than several minutes, as it 
is  usual  in  radiotherapy,  the  inactivation  mechanism  for  high-LET  radiation  may  be 
divided into two subsequent steps. First, a number of energy amounts is transferred to a 
given  cell  nucleus  (or  to  a  chromosomal  system)  by  individual  ionizing  particles  and 
corresponding damages of chromosomal DNA are formed.  

The cell attempts to repair the damage caused by all the traversing particles. One is 
entitled  to  expect  that  the  probability  of  an  unsuccessful  repair,  i.e.  the  inactivation 
probability, depends on total energy transferred to a given cell nucleus. In experiments 
with  cell  monolayers  irradiated  by  monoenergetic  ions,  practically  the  same  energy 
amount is transferred to cell nucleus during each ion passage; the energy amount being 
proportional to given LET value. The survival curve can be then expressed in the form

If the probabilities were combined in geometrical way, i.e.

which  would  correspond  to  independent  and  instantaneous  inactivation  effects  of

The last relations indicate that at least for low value of d the survival curve should differ 
significantly from a simple parabola described by the LQ model. The signs of αk terms 
alternate from k = 1 if ε > 0 and from k = 2 if ε < 0. 

However, the given approach demonstrating directly deviations from the LQ model 
can  be  applied  to  low  values  of  dose  only,  i.e.  to  low  average  number  of  traversing 
particles. The modifications ensuring the full applicability of the model also for higher 
dose values will be described in the next section. 

 
3. Non-polynomial application of the two-step model 
The polynomial expansion of survival curve cannot be applied practically to higher 
values of d as the average number of beam particles traversing a cell nucleus becomes 
too  high.  A  polynomial  of  very  high  order  would  have  to  be  used,  which  brings 
numerical problems even if large computers are made use of; for a detailed discussion, 
see Kundrat (2003). 

In such a case it is, however, possible to start with fitting experimental cell survival 
curves directly to the basic equations (1) and (3) where the parameter σ in Eq. (3) may 
(i)(λ)  needed  for  a 
be  taken  as  a  free  parameter  together  with  all  parameters  pk
corresponding  dose  value;  the  parameter  number  being  surely  higher  than  kav = hd, 
which is the average number of beam particles hitting a sensitive part of cell nucleus in 
irradiated cell population; e.g., kav ≈ 30 for σ = 10 µm2, λ = 10 keV/µm, d = 5 Gy. 

However,  the  actual  number  of  free  parameters  may  be  significantly  diminished  if 

one realizes that the following condition should be fulfilled:

It  is  then  possible  to  introduce  a  non-decreasing  function

4. Model analysis of proton and deuteron data 
The  general  model  scheme  described  in  the  preceding  section  has  been  applied  to 
experimental  data  obtained  by  Belli  et  al.  (1998)  in  irradiating  Chinese  hamster  V79 
cells by monoenergetic protons. Model calculations of cell survival curves together with 
experimental  data  for  different  values  of  LET  are  shown  in  Figure  1.  The  χ2  values 
depend  only  weakly  on  the  value  of  effective  cross  section  σ  in  the  interval 
10 µm2 ≤ σ ≤ 20 µm2. The values of other free parameters for individual LET values are 
given together with corresponding χ2 values in Table 1; they correspond to the effective 
cross section σ = 12.8 µm2 (to be compared with the average geometrical cross section 
for  the  V79  nucleus  σ = 134 µm2,  as  reported  by  Belli  et  al.  (1998)).  The  increase  of 
inactivation probabilities with the number of traversing particles, i.e. the k-dependences 
, for different LET values λ are shown in Figure 2.  
of functions 

)(kpλ

A similar analysis has been performed for cell survival data obtained by Folkard et 
al.  (1996)  for  irradiation  of  V79  cells  by  low-energy  deuterons.  The  same  value  of 
effective  cross  section  σ  has  been  assumed,  σ = 12.8 µm2;  the  values  of  other  free 
parameters  are  given  in  Table  2.  The  comparison  of  model  results  with  experimental 
data  is  shown  in  Figure  3.  The  inactivation  probabilities  for  different  LET  values  are 
presented in Figure 4. 

 
5. Discussion 
Cell  inactivation  probabilities  after  different  numbers  of  traversing  particles  are 
capable  to  reflect  important  characteristics  of  radiobiological  mechanism.  They 
represent  a  solid  basis  for  detailed  mathematical  modelling  of  complex  processes 
involved in cell inactivation by radiation. 

The  parameterization  used  in  our  analysis,  Eq. (12),  consists  of  a  weighted  sum  of 
two monotonous functions. It has been necessary to make use of such form in order to 
reproduce  the  given  experimental  data  precisely.  In  order  to  keep  the  number  of  free 
parameters  small,  the  function  [1-exp(-(ak)b)]  has  been  used  in  both  terms,  with 
different  parameter  values.  The  effective  number  of  free  parameters  has  been  reduced 
further  by  putting  e = 5.0  for  proton  and  e = 2.0  for  deuteron  survival  curves, 
respectively. 

For both protons and deuterons, the derived inactivation probabilities exhibit rather 
complex  behaviour.  They  indicate  that  at  least  two  different  kinds  of  inactivation 
mechanism have shared in the final effect. The first mechanism seems to be responsible 
for inactivation after lower numbers of energy transfer events. It may be interpreted as a 
direct inactivation effect. The other mechanism, manifesting itself from approximately 
k = 5 traversing particles, may be explained as the combination of chromosomal damage 
with  lowered  repair  capability  when  the  cell  has  been  burdened  by  greater  amount  of 
transferred energy. A kind of saturation effect seems also to be related to the first kind 
of mechanism, see Figure 2. 

The  given  analysis  is  to  be  regarded  as  preliminary  only,  as  the  results  have  been 
derived  from  a  rather  small  set  of  experimental  data  having  been  available.

Nevertheless, the proposed model has enabled a greater insight into the radiobiological 
mechanism. Some more detailed characteristics might be, of course, revealed if a more 
sophisticated model for the increase of inactivation probabilities with traversing particle 
numbers were used and a larger set of systematic experimental data were available. 

 
6. Conclusion  
The probabilistic two-stage model of radiobiological mechanism enables to describe 
not only the global shape of cell survival curves but also their detailed behaviour, which 
might  be  especially  important  in  case  of  fractionated  irradiation  where  even  small 
deviations  from  the  global  shape  are  being  largely  amplified.  Moreover,  the  given 
model enables one  to derive  the values of  cell  inactivation  probabilities after different 
numbers  of  particles  traversing  cell  nucleus,  which  opens  the  way  towards  detailed 
realistic modelling of complex physical, chemical and biological processes involved in 
the radiobiological mechanism. The given results represent also a necessary basis for a 
more  detailed  determination  of  inactivation  of  cell  population  irradiated  by  non-
monoenergetic  ions,  which  should  contribute  to  treatment  planning  in  clinical  hadron 
radiotherapy.

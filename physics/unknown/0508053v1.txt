1. INTRODUCTION 

 
The  investigation  of  collective  excitations,  especially 
electric and magnetic dipole vibrations of nuclei plays an 
important  role  in  determination  of  nuclear  structure.  The 
Nuclear  Resonant  Fluorescence  (NRF)  is  the  most 
efficient method to study these excitations [1]. However, 
the  capacity  of  traditional  NRF  experiments  for  study  of 
higher line excitations are limited by several factors [2].  

Recently,  a  new  method,  namely  FEL-Nucleus  Collider, 
has been proposed [3,4] which satisfy all requirements on 
ideal  photon  sources  [1]:  high  spectral  intensity,  good 
monochromaticity, tunability in a broad energy range and 
high  degree  of  linear  polarization.  For  these  reasons, 
tools 
FEL-nucleus  colliders  will  be  powerful 
for 
experimental  determination  of  energy 
levels,  decay 
widths,  spin  and  parity  of  excited  nuclei.  The  physics 
search 
collider  was 
demonstrated  for  the  154Sm  nucleus  excitations  in  [5], 
where the TTF FEL is considered as the source of photon 
beam.  The  advantages  of  a  FEL-RHIC  collider  with 
respect  to  traditional  NRF  methods  are  demonstrated  in 
[6] for some excitation levels of 232Th nucleus.

potential 

In  this  paper,  we  investigated  the  feasibility  and  physics 
search  potential  of  CLIC-LHC  based  FEL-Nucleus 
collider.     

2. NUCLEAR SPECTROSCOPY AND 
PHOTON SOURCES 

The data on electric and magnetic dipole excitations have 
revealed exciting new insights into nuclear structure. For 
example,  low-lying  dipole  excitations  (so-called  M1 
scissors  mode)  and  dipole  excitations  near  particle 
threshold in transition and deformed even-even nuclei are 
of  considerable  interest  in  modern  nuclear  structure 
physics.  Both  M1  and  E1  excitations  were  studied 
systematically to test nuclear models. Unfortunately, spin 
and parity of a lot of excitations are not determined with 
existing experimental facilities.  

There  are  several  methods  to  produce  photons  for  low 
energy  photon  scattering  experiments.  An  ideal  photon 

source  for  such  experiments  should  have  the  following 
characteristics [1]: 
•  High  spectral  intensity  I  =  Ng   /  eVs  (number  of 

photons per energy bin and second). 
•  Good monochromaticity (D Eg  / Eg ).  
•  Tunability in a broad energy range. 
•  High degree of linear polarization (Pg  » 100%). 

Unfortunately  up  to  now  there  are  no  such  ideal  sources 
available fulfilling all these requirements. Therefore, only 
with  the  advent  of  a  new  experimental  facility  with 
improved characteristics it  will be possible to investigate 
in  detail  the  fine  structure  of  the  magnetic  and  electric 
response. FEL-nucleus colliders will have all the required 
characteristics  due  to  the  use  of  a  FEL  beam  as  photon 
source.  

Free electron lasers can produce a photon beam in a wide 
region  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum  from  infra-red  to 
hard  X-ray  using  relativistic  electron  beams  with  small 
emittance and undulator magnets [7-9]. In the SASE FEL, 
a  high  quality  beam  of  relativistic  electrons  is  injected 
into an undulator, i.e. a straight set-up of magnetic dipoles 
with equal field strength and alternated polarities [8].  

3. FEL-NUCLEUS COLLIDERS 

The  accelerated  fully  ionized  nuclei  will  “see”  the  few 
keV  energy  FEL  photons  as  a  laser  beam  with  MeV 
energy [3, 4]. A schematic view of FEL-Nucleus collider 
is  given  in  Figure  1.  Due  to  good  monochromaticity 
(D Eγ/Eγ  ≈  ρ  <10-3-10-4)  with  a  typical  obtainable  number 
of  photons  of  the  order  of  1013g /bunch,  tunability  and 
better polarization (Pγ ≈ 100%) of the FEL beam,  FEL-
nucleus  colliders  can  be  successfully  used  to  investigate 
nuclear  excitations  with  low  multi  polarity  in  a  wide 
energy region. The needed energy of FEL photons can be 
expressed as:

For example, we obtain a wavelength range from 0.4 nm

In  [3-6],  a  FEL  driven  by  a  superconducting  linac  has 
been  considered.  In  the  case  of  LHC,  and  if  CLIC  is 
eventually built at CERN [12], it would be interesting to 
explore  the  possibility  of  using  CLIC  components  to 
accelerate the FEL electron beam.

Potential advantages of a CLIC-based FEL  would be the 
(partial) use of existing equipment, and the possibility of 
reaching  a  high  acceleration  gradient,  resulting  in  a 
shorter  linac.  On  the  other  hand,  as  pointed  out  in 
previous  work  [13],  the  use  of  high  frequency  RF  for 
acceleration  is  disadvantageous  in  terms  of  beam  energy 
spread, which is required to be small by FEL physics.  

A  more  promising  option,  which  we  will  explore  in  the 
following, is to use a fraction of the CLIC drive beam to 
power  a  high-frequency,  normal-conducting 
linac 
dedicated to FEL operation. A natural choice of the linac 
frequency  would  be  15  GHz,  which  corresponds  to  the 
drive  beam  bunch  repetition  frequency  (in  CLIC  the 
power is produced at the 2nd harmonic of the drive beam, 
30 GHz). The linac will have a lower gradient and/or will 
be less efficient than the CLIC main linac, but the energy 
spread  can  be  made  smaller, 
thus  satisfying  FEL 
requirements (typically s p < 10-3).  

The  LHC  ion  beam  is  composed  of  bunches  with  rms 
duration of 250 ps, separated by 100 ns. In a CLIC-based 
FEL,  while  the  repetition  rate  is  of  the  order  of  200  Hz, 

the bunch spacing is linked to the time structure of the RF 
pulses  that  can  be  produced  by  the  drive  beam.  Using 
only  a  drive  beam  pulse  per  cycle  (~  2  %  of  the  total 
CLIC power) to accelerate a single electron bunch (frep = 
150 Hz, nb = 1) and assuming s x = s y = 30 µm, nA = 7 107 
and  ng  =  2.5  1013  we  can  obtain  a  “minimum”  value  for 
the luminosity: L = 2.3 1027 cm-2s-1. 

Although  the  luminosity  thus  obtained  is  not  completely 
negligible,  the  situation  is  far  from  optimum.  Some 
improvements  can  be  expected  by  a  somewhat  better 
matching of the nucleus beam and the gamma beam sizes 
(16 µm and 30 µm, respectively); but the highest gain can 
be  obtained  by  a  more  efficient  use  of  the  drive  beam. 
Possibly  the  best  option  is  to  use  part  of  the  drive  beam 
pulse train as it comes out of the delay loop (see Fig. 2).  

Assuming  the  still  tentative  new  CLIC  parameter  list 
found  in  [14],  one  see  that  at  this  stage  a  drive  beam  is 
composed  by  70  ns  pulses,  spaced  by  140  ns.  Assuming 
for  instance  the  use  of  an  alternative,  slightly  shorter 
delay loop this can be brought easily to 50 ns long pulses, 
spaced by 100 ns. Each pulse can then be used to provide 
an  RF  pulse  useful  to  accelerate  an  electron  pulse.  The 
total number of pulses available depends on  how large a 
fraction  of  additional  power  one  is  willing  to  use.  As  an 
example, we consider using 10 µs, i.e., 10 % of the total 
CLIC  drive  beam  pulse,    which  will  provide  nb  =  100, 
increasing  the  luminosity  by  the  same  factor.  Detailed

5   PHYSICS SEARCH POTENTIAL  

Decay widths, spin and parity of a lot of excited levels are 
not determined by NRF methods. A FEL-Nucleus collider 
will  give  opportunity  to  measure  these  quantities.  For 
example,  due  to  high  statistics,  unknown  decay  widths 
can  be  determined  using  known  ones  [3].  The  spin  of 
excited  nucleus  can  be  determined  using  the  angular 
distribution  of  emitted  photons  [5].  Determination  of  the 
parity is considered in [6].

5.1 Pb example  
Main characteristics of the 208Pb excitations with low spin 
(J≤2),  observed  in 
  reactions  are  presented  in  the 
Table 2 [15]. Let us mention that there are a lot of other 
(J≤2)  levels  of  the  208Pb  which  are  observed  in  different 
reactions, such as (e,e′ ) etc. These levels are not observed 
by  traditional  NRF  methods,  but  most  of  them  will  be 
seen at FEL-nucleus collider.

The  needed  FEL  energies  ( FEL

cross-sections  and  event  numbers  per  second  for  CLIC-
LHC  based  FEL-Pb  collider  are  given  on  the  last  four 
columns  of  the  Table  1.  One  can  see  that  due  to  huge 
events  rates,  FEL-nucleus  collider  will  give  opportunity 
to  determine  main  characteristics  of  excited  nuclei  in  a 
very  short  time  period  comparing  with  traditional  NRF 
methods.

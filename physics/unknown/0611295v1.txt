We develop a new approach to the study of the dynamics of link utilization in complex 

networks  using  records  of  communication  in  a  large  social  network.  Counter  to  the 

perspective that nodes have particular roles, we find roles change dramatically from day 

to  day.  "Local  hubs"  have  a power  law  degree  distribution  over  time,  with  no 

characteristic degree value. Our results imply a significant reinterpretation of the concept 

of  node  centrality  in  complex  networks,  and  among  other conclusions  suggest  that 

interventions targeting hubs will have significantly less effect than previously thought.

Recent  advances  have  demonstrated  that  the  study  of  universal properties  in  physical 

systems may be extended to complex networks in biological and social systems [4, 5, 6, 

10,  24].  This  has  opened the  study  of  such  networks  to  experimental  and  theoretical 

characterization of properties and mechanisms of formation. In this paper we extend the 

study of  complex  networks  by  considering  the  dynamics  of  the  activity  of network 

connections. Our analysis suggests that fundamentally new insights can be obtained from 

the dynamical behavior, including a dramatic time dependence of the role of nodes that is 

not  apparent  from  static  (time  aggregated)  analysis  of  node  connectivity  and network 

topology. 

  We  study  the  communication  between  57,158  e-mail  users  based  on  data  sampled 

over  a  period  of  113  days  from  log  files  maintained  by  the  email  server  at  a  large 

university  [18].  The  time  when  an  e-mail  link  is  established  between  any  pair  of  email 

addresses  is  routinely  registered  in  a  server,  enabling  the  analysis  of  the  temporal 

dynamics of the interactions within the network. To consider only emails that reflect the 

flow  of  valuable  information,  spam  and  bulk  mailings  were  excluded  using  a  prefilter. 

There were 447,543 messages exchanged by the users during 113 days observation. We 

report results obtained by treating the communications as an undirected network, where 

email  addresses  are  regarded  as  nodes  and  two  nodes  are  linked  if  there  is  an  e-mail 

communication  between  them.  Analysis  based  upon  treating  the  network  with 

asymmetric  links  (where  a  distinction  is  made  between  out-going  links  and  incoming 

links)  gave  essentially  equivalent  results.  From  the  temporal  connectivity  data,  a  time 

series  of  topological  networks  can  be  obtained;  each  represents  an  aggregation  of  links 

over a time scale that is short compared to the duration of observation (113 days). The 

edges forming each network in the time series thus represent the short time opportunity 

for  communication  as  detected  by  the  log  files  of  the  email  server.  Unless  otherwise 

indicated, we set the time scale to one day, thus creating 113 consecutive daily networks. 

  Most studies of large social networks have accumulated data over the entire time of 

observation, whereas here using the smaller intervals of accumulation we can study how 

the network interactions change over time. Social network dynamics has historically been 

of  interest,  though  data  was  limited  [1,13].  Recent  papers  have  considered  the  times 

between  communications  [14],  the  creation  of  temporally  linked  structures  [15],  or  the 

 

2

addition  of  social  links  [16].  In  this  paper  we  study  for  the  first  time  the  dynamics  of 

individual importance [21].  

  Our first result is that networks obtained on different days are substantially different 

from  each  other.  Fig.  1  shows  the  correlation  between  corresponding  edges  of  the  113 

daily networks. Surprisingly, we find that all networks are weakly correlated, despite the 

expected  routine  nature  of  the  social  activity.  Correlations  between  any  two  networks 

have  a  distribution  that  is  approximately  normal  with  a  mean  ±   standard  deviation  of 

0.15

05.0±

  (we  adopt  this  notation  throughout).  The  low  correlation  implies  that  the 

existence  of  a  link  between  two  individuals  at  one  time  does  not  make  it  much  more 

likely that the link will appear at another time. While all networks are weakly correlated, 

we  find  that  workdays  and  weekends  are  more  distinct,  so  that  workday  networks,  and 

weekend  networks  are  more  correlated  among  themselves  (correlations  0.17

03.0±

  and 

0.16

05.0±

,  respectively),  than  they  are  with  each  other  (correlation  0.12

02.0±

). 

Remarkably, the low correlations increase only very gradually if we form networks using 

data  over  multiple  days,  and  never  reach  a  high  value  even  if  networks  are  made  from 

communications over a month or more [Fig. 1(b)]. 

  Using the nodal "degree" (the number of nodes a particular node is connected to) we 

characterized the centrality of nodes in the daily networks. Each of the daily networks has 

a distribution of nodal degrees well described by a power-law [12], with exponents in the 

range 

[2.5,
 
2.8]

. Thus a small number of highly connected nodes have great importance in 

the connectivity of the network. However, while each daily network has highly connected 

nodes,  we  found  that  they  were  not  the  same  nodes.  The  degree  of  a  node  varied 

dramatically over time. For each identified ‘local hub,’ we measured its degree from day 

to  day  over  the  duration  of  observation.  Surprisingly,  we  find  that  a  large  number  of 

‘local  hubs’  exhibit  a  highly  fluctuating  time-series  (Fig.  2).  The  corresponding 

distribution  of  degrees  over  time  itself  follows  a  scale-free  power-law  distribution  over 

two orders of magnitude (Fig. 2). The degree distribution of a hub over time implies that 

the node’s degree does not have a characteristic value. The degree is small most of the 

time, but we only need to wait long enough to encounter degrees of any size.  

 

  A broader characterization of which nodes are important on a given day was made by 

comparing how the nodes were ranked in importance. We identified the top 1000 nodes, 

 

3

about 1.7% of the network according to their degree, for each of the daily networks. We 

then determined, for each pair of daily networks, the percentage of nodes that appear in 

both  top-ranking  lists  (“centrality  overlap,”  Fig.  3).  The  centrality  overlap  between  any 

two  networks  is  small,  around  0.27

06.0±

.  When  considering  separately  workday  and 

weekend  networks,  the  overlap  values  are  around  0.33

03.0±

  and  0.20

04.0±

, 

respectively; consistent with the bimodal nature of the social activity. The distinctiveness 

of  the  top  1,000  nodes  between  daily  networks  is  also  typical  for  other  top-ranking  list 

sizes. By varying the percentage of nodes in the top-ranking list, it is found that the mean 

centrality overlap, which is already small for small percentages (0.3), actually decreases 

to a value of 0.2 at around 4%, before increasing slowly to 1 when the list includes all the 

nodes.  The  distributions  of  ranking  overlaps  are  well  behaved,  having  a  standard 

deviation much smaller than the mean. 

  We compared daily networks with the aggregate network, as would be considered by 

other  contemporary  studies,  by  aggregating  over  the  entire  113  day  observation.  Our 

previous  results  suggest,  and  direct  analysis  confirms,  that  daily  networks  deviate 

significantly from the aggregate network. We determined which nodes in the daily 1000 

top-ranking list also appear in the top-ranking list of the aggregate network, obtaining the 

binary  image  in  Figure  4(a).  Though  some  nodes  that  are  ranked  high  in  the  daily 

networks are also ranked high in the aggregate network, a significant number are not. In 

particular, we find that the centrality overlap is 0.41

03.0±

 and 0.27

04.0±

, for weekday 

and weekends respectively. Comparing other sizes of the top ranked nodes gives similar 

results. Perhaps even more surprisingly, the nodes that are highly ranked in the aggregate 

network are not even on-average important in daily networks. To show this we calculated 

the  average  ranking  position  of  the  top  1000  highly  connected  nodes  in  the  aggregate 

network for each daily network. The average ranking position over time (normalized to a 

fraction  so  that  1  is  the  highest  and  0  is  the  lowest)  exhibits  a  weekly  oscillation  from 

about 0.40 to 0.65. In the aggregate network these nodes have an average ranking of 0.99. 

This shows that highly connected nodes in the aggregate network only play a moderate 

role in the daily networks.  

Finally, we considered a full range of networks formed by aggregating links over time 

scales that are longer than a day and shorter than the full time period [Fig. 4(b)]. Similar 

 

 

4

relationships between smaller and larger time scales to those found above are observed. 

Moreover,  the  similarity  between  networks  at  a  particular  time  scale  increases  as  a 

power-law, so there is no particular time scale at which a converged structure is achieved. 

Thus, the network dynamics follows a “multiscale” structure with networks at each scale 

forming  scale-free  topologies,  but  the  specific  links  in  existence  vary  dramatically 

between observation time scales as well as over time. 

 

In  summary,  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  static  topology  does  not  capture  the 

dynamics of social networks. The prominence of nodes (as measured by degree) within 

the  networks  fluctuates  widely  from  day  to  day,  and  a  high  degree  in  the  aggregate 

network does not predict a high degree for individual days. Our conclusions are in sharp 

contrast  to  previous  complex  network  research,  which  emphasizes  the  importance  of 

aggregate nodal centrality in a static network topology [4-11,15-18].  

Implications  of  a  dynamic  node  centrality  contrast  with  existing  analyses  that 

consider  targeting  nodes  with  the  highest degrees  to  disrupt  network  communication  or 

transport. Dynamic centrality implies that targeting nodes with the highest degrees at one 

time  only  weakly  affects  the  nodes  that  are  highly  connected  at  another  time.  The 

approach  of  targeting  high-degree  nodes  has  been  suggested,  for  example,  to  be  an 

effective  disease  and  computer  virus  prevention  strategy;  i.e.  identification  and 

“vaccination”  of  those nodes, would inhibit  the spread of infection or computer viruses 

[10,18-20,22,23].  Our  work  implies  that,  at  the  very  least,  a  more  agile  strategy  of 

monitoring  and  vaccinating  nodes  based  upon  centrality  over  time  is  necessary. 

Otherwise  a  treatment  based  upon  aggregate  connectivity  information  will  miss  the 

impact of a node that otherwise has a low connectivity, becoming highly connected. 

The type of dynamic analysis of networks we performed is pertinent to a wide range 

of network types. Whether or not there exists an underlying fixed topological structure, 

the question of which links  are actually used is a relevant one. Thus, actual travel on a 

transportation  network,  and  actual  interactions  that  occur  between  molecules  that  can 

bind to each other, are both examples of networks that have an underlying structure but 

whose dynamic structure is relevant to the behavior of the system over time. In addition 

to the e-mail network studied here, we have found similar results when analyzing social 

 

5

network  data  about  interactions  found  from  the  spatial  proximity  of  personal  Bluetooth 

wireless devices [21].

Abstract. 
 
   The possibility of the phenomenon of Bose condensation having a part to play in the 
discussion  of  neutron  stars  has  been  around  for  some  time.  Here  the  sorts  of 
temperatures and densities that might be involved are discussed. Also, an alternative 
way  of  viewing  the  Bose  condensation  phenomenon  is  examined  once  more  and, 
although  found  to  lead  to  more  accurate  results  in  traditional  examples,  is  found  to 
have little numerical effect in astrophysical examples.

1. Introduction. 
 
    For some time now, the suggestion has been abroad that kaon condensation could 
have a role to play in the understanding of neutron stars [1]. In fact, the appearance of 
a Bose-Einstein condensate of charged pions in dense nuclear matter has been under 
discussion since the early seventies, as was noted in the above reference. However, as 
far as a possible Bose condensation occurring in a star or, indeed, the notion of a star 
being  composed  primarily  of  a  Bose  condensate,  are  concerned,  questions  of 
admissible  condensation  temperatures  and  corresponding  number  densities  do  not 
appear to have been addressed. This is easily rectified in the simple case of an ideal 
Bose gas by referring to an article on ideal relativistic Bose condensation dating back 
to 1965 [2] and leads to some interesting results.  
    However,  it  is  noted  also  that  there  are  problems  with  the  traditional  approach  to 
the  whole  question  of  Bose-Einstein  condensation.  A  totally  different  approach  was 
investigated some  years ago [3] but is revisited here to illustrate, once again, that at 
least some of the well-known difficulties of the usual approach to the problem may be 
avoided. 
 
 
2. Theory of Bose Condensation. 
 
   In the usually accepted way, consider an ideal Bose gas withn (E)dE single-particle 
quantum states in an energy range dE. Here E excludes the rest energy e o = mc2. If the 
number  of  particles  in  the  lowest  energy  level  is  N1(a ,T)  at  temperature  T,  then  the 
total number of particles in the system is

where a  = (m  - e o)/kT, m  being the chemical potential. As the temperature is lowered, 
the numerical value of a , in the limit of infinite volume, decreases, and can in some 
cases  become  zero  at  a  critical  temperature  Tc  >  0.  Hence,  for  a  large  volume,  this 
condensation temperature may be defined by 
 
                                    a  < 0 for T > Tc,  a  = 0 for T£
 
If (2.2) is used in (2.1), a unique condition for T = Tc is not obtained unless (2.2) is 
supplemented by 
 
                                        N1(a ,T) << N  for  T ‡
 
where the equality sign is important. Below the condensation temperature, N1(a ,T) is 
a non-negligible fraction of N. Accordingly, Tc follows from the relation 
 

 Tc,                                                   (2.3)

    For a relativistic gas, the density of states is 
 
                            n (E) = (4p V/h3c3)(E + e o)(E2 + 2e oE)1/2.                                     (2.5) 
 
Using this expression in (2.4) yields  
                                              N  =  4p V(kTc/hc)3K(0,1,uc),                                      (2.6)

Approximate solutions of (2.6) for each of the two limiting cases may be obtained by 
expanding the numerator of the integrand of K(0,1,uc) to give

As is shown in detail in reference [2], if condensation temperature is plotted against

another  straight  line  whose  equation  is  given  by  eliminating  N/V  between  (2.7)  and 
(2.8). The result of this elimination is the equation

Above this line relativistic effects become important. It might be noted also that the 
higher  the  concentration,  the  higher  the  rest  mass  at  which  these  effects  begin  to 
appear.  For  the  kaons  mentioned  above,  this  equation  gives  a  value  for  the 
condensation temperature of 7.13 ·
 1012  oK. Using this value in either (2.7) or (2.8) 
shows that, for these kaons, relativistic effects will come into play for  values of the 
concentration above approximately 3 ·
 1039, which implies above a mass density of 
approximately 2.67 ·
 
    All of the above, apart from the brief application to kaons, is well documented in 
[2], from which further details may be extracted. However, to reach the above results, 
even in a more rigorous deduction, the condensation temperature is said to have been 

 1015gms/cc.

reached when a  = 0. It is claimed frequently, and correctly, that a  must remain non-
zero since, if not, the implication is that the number of particles in the lowest energy 
level becomes infinite. Initially, though, the total number of particles in the system is 
always assumed both fixed and finite. In most traditional approaches to the topic, as 
here, these latter points are either ignored or glossed over.  
 
 
3. An alternative approach to Bose-Einstein condensation. 
 
    The  so-called  Bose-Einstein  distribution,  which  is  really  an  expression  for  the 
average  number  of  particles  in  a  given  energy  range  as  a  function  of  the  absolute 
temperature  rather  than  a  genuine  distribution,  may  be  derived  from  the  negative 
binomial distribution

where p and q are the a priori occupation and absence probabilities, by writing it as a 
law  of  error  for  which  the  most  probable  value  coincides  with  the  mean  of  the 
distribution. The entropy is the potential function which determines the law of error 
and the second law of thermodynamics then determines the Bose-Einstein distribution. 
The  negative  binomial  distribution  (3.1)  is  actually  the  probability  of  finding  n 
identical  unnumbered  particles  in  W
  boxes,  with  no  empty  boxes.  The  binomial 
coefficient  is  the  number  of  ways  the  n  particles  may  be  distributed  among  the  W
 
boxes. If W
                                                     fL(n;p) = pqn,                                                         (3.2) 
which  is  the  geometric  distribution.  Hence,  the  case  where  the  density  of  states  is 
unity  does  not  belong  to  the  negative  binomial  distribution  but,  rather,  to  the 
geometric distribution. This seemingly innocuous result immediately raises questions 
concerning the extraction of the term relating to the number of particles in the lowest 
energy  level  from  the  sum  and  subsequently  writing  the  expression  for  the  total 
number of particles in the system as in (2.1).    
 
   However,  as  was  shown  some  time  ago  [3],  probability  distributions  belonging  to 
the same family may enter into ‘equilibrium’ with one another in much the same way 
as material phases do, but can this idea be used in the present context? It does seem 
that the Bose-Einstein gas might be thought to owe its condensation phenomenon to 
an  osmotic  equilibrium  established  between  the  negative  binomial  and  geometric 
distributions.  The  osmotic  equilibrium  that  is  maintained  by  a  pressure  difference 
between  the  two  phases  may  be  thought  due  to  some  semi-permeable  ‘membrane’. 
This  ‘membrane’  would  be  permeable  to  the  Bose-Einstein  gas  (particles  in  excited 
states)  but  not  to  the  condensate  (particles  in  the  zero  energy  state).  The  Bose-
Einstein  condensation,  or  osmotic  equilibrium,  would  exist  at  any  temperature. 
However, at high temperatures, few particles will be in the zero energy state and so, 
the  equilibrium  will  be  insignificant.  The  onset  of  what  is  normally  called  Bose-
Einstein  condensation  will  occur  at  the  point  where  the  osmotic  pressure  exhibits  a 
minimum with respect to the mole fraction.

    The latter two equations give the mean numbers for the two phases with chemical

These  pressures  may  be  seen  to  satisfy  the  generalised  Clapeyron  equation  (3.7), 
establishing  the  fact  that  a  phase  equilibrium  has  been  attained.  This  equilibrium  is 
independent of the actual nature of the system, which is specified only when a definite 
expression is given for W
, the number of states in a given energy interval. Hence, the 
phase equilibrium may apply to relativistic particles of zero mass as well as to non-
relativistic ones. The stability criteria must be obtained in terms of the total pressures 
but,  since  they  must  be  independent  of  the  energy  of  a  particular  mode,  the  phase 
equilibrium must be established between each excited mode belonging to the negative 
binomial  distribution  and  the  ground  state  belonging  to  the  geometric  distribution. 
This must also be so since the excited modes do not interact with one another. 
 
    At  the  point  where  the  above  pressures  are  equal,  m G  >  m L.  Hence,  in  order  to 
achieve equilibrium, PL > PG. The excess pressure, PL - PG, is the osmotic pressure.

since the total number of particles is conserved. Hence, it cannot be concluded, in a 
truly realistic model, that the total  gas pressure is independent of the volume below 
the critical temperature; - this conclusion follows only if m  = 0 and, as is seen from 
(3.11), this would imply

since  g3/2(z)  is  a  bounded,  positive,  monotonically  increasing  function  of  z  between 
zero and one. 
 
   This  approach  is  obviously  quite  appealing,  producing,  as  it  does,  a  figure  for  the 
condensation temperature so close to the experimentally measured value of 2.18oK as 
opposed  to  that  derived  by  traditional  means.  Also,  and  very  importantly,  the 
traditional approach ends up with an infinite number of particles in the ground state 
and this hardly compatible with the assumption of a fixed number of particles. As far 
as applications to possible Bose condensates in stars are concerned, the new approach 
has  little  effect  on  the  final  value  for  the  condensation  temperature.  In  fact,  the 
difference  between  the  two  approaches  is  seen  to  amount  to  introducing  a  factor 
(1/2)2/3 into the final expression for the critical temperature and this would mean that 
the condensation temperature for the kaons mentioned above would be 4.49 ·
 1012 oK, 
rather than 7.13 · 1012 oK as given earlier. 
 
 
4. Questions remaining. 
 
    Even  with  this  alternative  approach  to  Bose-Einstein  condensation,  problems 
remain. As stated earlier, the total osmotic pressure P tot, as given by  (3.10), will be 
positive for values of z very close to unity. However, the idea presented here is that 
the critical temperature occurs when 

z

and,  at  this  value  of  z,  if  N  =  1024,  -ln(1  -  z)  »
appreciably smaller than Vg5/2(z)/l 3. 
 
   Two possibilities immediately occur as resolutions to this difficulty: 

N

c

  55.26,  which  is  not  large  and  is 

(a)  since  the  stability  criteria  must  be  independent  of  the  energy  of  a  particular 
mode,  as  mentioned  earlier,  the  phase  equilibrium  must  be  established 
between  each  excited  mode  belonging  to  the  negative  binomial  distribution 
and the ground state belonging to the geometric distribution. It is possible for 
PL  >  PG  for  all  excited  states  without  PL  being  greater  than 
totP ;  that  is, 
without P tot being positive;

           However, if this is the correct route towards the resolution of the problem,   
       (3.2) would be replaced by an expression derived by putting W  = w  in (3.1)  
       not equal to one, and this would give

        distributions. 
            
    These  latter  points  obviously  require  more  time  and  thought  devoted  to  them.

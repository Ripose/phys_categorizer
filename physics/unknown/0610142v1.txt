1. Introduction   

Up to now, there have been no proofs of the incompatibility of the theory of special relativity with 

the absolute reference frame (i.e., the reference frame at rest): that is, the absolute reference frame has 

not been theoretically or experimentally denied.   

Sato [1, 2] argued that the Michelson-Morley interference experiment cannot detect earth drift in the 

absolute  reference  frame.  This  is  because  the  Michelson-Morley  experiment  showed  an  interference 

condition and did not show the simultaneous arrival of two photons. This is because the single photon 

Michelson-Morley interference experiment, as shown in Fig. 1, can be carried out only where there is a 

single photon. It was pointed out that the Michelson-Morley interference experiment cannot detect any 

experimental setup motion in the absolute reference frame.   

Counterintuitive aspects of the theory of special relativity have arisen because the absolute reference 

frame  is  not  adopted.  If  the  absolute  reference  frame  in  the  theory  of  special  relativity  is  discussed 

clearly, a more intuitive interpretation of the theory of special relativity is possible. For example, the 

twin paradox does not appear because the trajectories of the twins are clearly identified not only in the 

absolute reference frame but also in absolute velocity space.

The  longitudinal  Doppler  shift  between  two  moving  bodies  in  the  absolute  reference  frame  has 

already  been  derived  [3].  In  this  paper,  we  show  the  compatibility  of  the  theory  of  special  relativity 

with the absolute reference frame in this longitudinal Doppler shift. Furthermore, we show how to find 

a stationary state in the absolute reference frame.

experiment:  there  is  only  a  single  photon  in the interferometer,  then 

the  arrival  time  between  paths  1  and  2  cannot  be  measured.  This 

experiment shows that the interference condition does not depend on 

the earth motion. That is, we cannot detect any earth motion using the 

Michelson interferometer. 

2    Representation of relative velocity   

The  relative  velocity  of  rockets  S  and  A  in  Fig.  2  is  derived.  Where  vS  is  the  absolute  velocity  of 

rocket S and vA is that of rocket A, and 

v ≥
A

. It is rather difficult to derive the equation of relative 

velocity.  From  the  analogy  of  the  relativistic  velocity  addition  law,  we  do  not  predict  the  relative 

velocity as v = vA – vS.

The  velocity  u  in  equation  (3)  contains  absolute  velocities  vS  and  vA  as  represented  in  equation  (1). 

However,  equation  (3)  is  in  good  agreement  with  the  orthodox  representation  of  the  Doppler  shift 

frequency.  Through  modification  of  equation  (1),  the  postulate  of  an  absolute  reference  frame  is 

compatible with the essence of the Doppler shift representation in the theory of special relativity. The 

essence is  that  the  Doppler shift  frequency  can  be  represented  by the  form  of  equation  (3):  that  is,  it 

If we assume that the two rockets are traveling at speeds of 40% (rocket S) and 60% (rocket A) of the 

speed  of  light  c  as  shown  in  Fig.  2  then  according  to  equation  (3)  we  obtain  the  relative  velocity 

depends only on the relative velocity u.

This velocity u shows not only the velocity that rocket S sees rockets A but also that at which rocket 

A  sees  rocket  S,  thus  we  can  calculate  the  Doppler  shift  frequency  using  equation  (3):  that  is  the 

essence of the orthodox representation of Doppler shift.   

Let us consider another rocket A’ that is traveling slower than rocket S with the relative velocity of 

c

  as shown in Fig. 3. The absolute velocity of rocket A’ (vA') can be calculated. The velocity that

4. To find the reference frame at rest using the sing around method 

In  section  3,  we  showed  that  the  postulate  of  the  absolute  reference  frame  is  compatible  with  the 

essence of the Doppler shift representation in the theory of special relativity. That is the Doppler shift 

frequency depends on the relative velocity which is derived using the relativistic velocity addition law. 

We  also  showed  that  the  relative  velocity  can  be  experimentally  detected  using  the  Doppler  shift 

frequency.

mountains shown in Fig. 5.

This section describes a simple method which can be used to find the reference frame at rest. Instead 

of the Doppler shift, the sing around method, which was previously attempted by Galileo using lanterns 

on top of two mountains (Fig. 5), is applied. The sing around experimental setup using a light source [1, 

3], which uses two pairs of light sources and detectors as shown in Fig. 4, can be constructed, where a 

pulsed  signal  (a  flash  of  light)  is  transmitted  by  light  source  1  and  detected  by  detector  2.  After  its 

detection, a new pulsed signal is transmitted by light source 2, detected by detector 1, transmitted again 

by light source 1, and so on. Light sources are constructed using LEDs, and the detection is made by 

photo diodes. We can measure the repetition frequency of the flash of light. 

Several  pairs  of  rockets  are  launched  from  rocket  S  for  all  directions.  Let  us  consider  two  pairs  of 

rockets,  one  pair  consists  of  rockets  A  and  A’  traveling  parallel  to  rocket  S  and  the  other  consists  of 

rockets  B  and  B’  traveling  vertical  to  rocket  S.  Figure  6  shows  two  pairs  of  rockets.  The  relative 

velocity between rockets S and A is

Equation  (4)  indicates  that  the  relative  velocities  can  be  experimentally  defined  using  the  Doppler 

shift frequencies: the rockets should be accelerated to obtain the same Doppler shift frequency. If there 

is  another  method  to  define  the  velocity  that  is  different  from  the  Doppler  shift,  we  can  detect  the 

motion  of  rocket  S  in  the  absolute  reference  frame  (we  can  calculate  the  absolute  velocity).  The 

Doppler shift frequency is affected by the motion of the light source and the detector: that is, the light 

source frequency and the reference time of detector are affected by the motion. The sing around method 

does not use the reference time but only compares the repletion timing of the sing around signals. For 

example, the repletion timings of the sing around signals of rockets A and A’ is gradually shifting as 

shown in Fig. 5. On the other hand, the signals of rockets B and B’ are completely coincident as shown 

in Fig. 6. Thus we can know the direction of the rocket S motion in the absolute reference frame. The 

direction of the motion of rocket S is toward rocket A. Thus, we know the direction to decelerate rocket 

S toward rocket A’. Then we can put the rocket S in a stationary state.

rockets  A,  A’,  B,  and  B’  is  calculated  as 

u

=

.  The  Doppler 

5

frequency is represented as equation (4). The repletion timings of sing 

around  pulses  are  gradually  shifted between  rockets A and A’ thus  we 

know the absolute motion of rocket S. 

In this discussion, only Einstein’s assumption, in which a photon travels at the speed of light, c, in 

vacuum regardless of the velocity of the light source, is used; thus, the three rockets will detect the 

flashes of light as shown in Fig. 5. Rockets A and A’ are launched in opposite directions from rocket S 

to detect the same Doppler shift frequency, the flash pattern of light that rocket S detects is shown as 

the points on the line v=0.4c in Fig. 5.   

The  sing  around  method  does  not  care  the  Doppler  shift  of  the  flash  of  light.  It  requests  only  a 

repetition timing of the flash of light; therefore, the discussion becomes clear and simple. We propose a 

new method that is different from the Michelson-Morley interference experiment to detect the motion 

in the absolute reference frame. 

The experimental procedure to find the reference frame at rest is: 

(1)  Rockets  are  launched  in  all  directions  from  rocket  S  and  accelerated  so  as  to  detect  the  same 

Doppler  shift  frequency:

and  so  on,  if  the  same  Doppler 

shift frequency is detected all rockets are in the same relative velocity to rocket S.   

(2)  Detect  the  timings  of  sing  around  pulses  between  the  pair  rockets.  Rockets  S  is  moving  in  the 

7

direction of the rockets pair which shows the largest timing difference of sing around light pulses: 

in Fig. 8 rocket S travels toward rocket A. Then, decelerate rocket S toward rocket A’.   

(3)  Repeat the procedure (1) and (2) so as to rocket S detect the same timings of sing around pulses for 

all pairs of rockets.

Fig. 7    The sing around method of a light source: in this case rocket S travels toward 

rocket A. Rockets A’ and A are launched from rocket S in opposite direction in order to 

detect  the  same  Doppler  shift  frequency.  The  speed  of  light,  c  is  assumed  to  be 

constant regardless of the velocity of the light source. The light paths are drawn in the 

figure. The Doppler frequencies of rockets A and A’ shown from rocket S can also be

. The relative velocities between rocket S and rockets A 

and A’ are equal. However, the arrival timings of the return pulses detected at rocket S 

gradually shift. This indicates that rocket S is not in a stationary state in the absolute 

reference frame, and rocket S should be decelerated toward rocket A’ which is closer to 

the stationary state.   

We have two methods to define the velocity: one is the Doppler shift frequency and the other is the 

repetition timings of the sing around light pluses. Thus we can detect the reference frame at rest.   

  The timings shown on line vS=0.4c in Fig, 7, three rockets travel as shown in Fig. 3, thus, rocket S is 

decelerated to leave rocket A (accelerated toward rocket A’). Figure 8 shows the transverse motion of 

rockets  B  and  B’  with  rocket  S.  The  repetition  timings  of  sing  around  light  pulses  are  coincident. 

Figure  8 also represents the  motion of rockets A and A’ when rocket S is in a stationary state in the

5. Merit of the representation using the absolute reference frame 

We showed that the absolute reference frame is compatible with the orthodox Doppler shift equation. 

It  is  said  that  there  is  no  absolute  reference  frame:  however,  there  is  no  proof  of  incompatibility 

between the theory of special relativity and the absolute reference frame. We showed that the absolute 

reference frame can be detected. We are able to know not only the relative velocity but also the absolute 

velocities of the two rockets.   

If we adopt the absolute reference frame, there is no twin paradox because the traveling paths of twins 

can be clearly identified in the absolute reference frame. Furthermore, the paths of twins in the absolute 

velocity space can be identified. The merit of the representation using the absolute reference frame is 

that a more intuitive interpretation of the theory of special relativity is possible.

6. Conclusion 

We  showed  the  compatibility  of  the  theory  of  special  relativity  with  the  absolute  reference  frame 

with  a  longitudinal  Doppler  shift.  Using  two  absolute  velocities  vA  and  vS  (

v ≥
A

),  the  relative 

velocity  u  is  represented  as

This representation satisfies the essence of the theory of special relativity. We also showed one way to 

detect  the  absolute  reference  frame.  The  representation  of  the  theory  of  special  relativity  using  the 

absolute reference frame makes a more intuitive interpretation possible.   

At  this  stage  the  postulate  of  the  absolute  reference  frame  can  be  only  discussed  as  a  thought 

experiment because there is no experimental data: however this postulate can prevent the twin paradox 

from entering the theory of special relativity without any modification to the theory of special relativity.

The relative velocity addition in Fig. 1, where vA is the summation of vS and u, is represented as, 

.                                                                                                                            (A-1) 

Thus, the relative velocity u is derived as, 

.                                                                                                                              (1) 

Then using equation (1), the Doppler frequency between rockets S and A is represented as,

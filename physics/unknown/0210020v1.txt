Abstract
—A semiempirical parametric method is proposed for modeling three-dimensional (time-resolved)
vibronic spectra of polyatomic molecules. The method is based on the use of the fragment approach in the for-
mation of molecular models for excited electronic states and parametrization of these molecular fragments by
modeling conventional (one-dimensional) absorption and ﬂuorescence spectra of polyatomic molecules. All
matrix elements that are required for calculations of the spectra can be found by the methods developed. The

) of vibronic levels can be most conveniently found
time dependences of the populations of a great number (
by using the iterative numerical method of integration of kinetic equations. Convenient numerical algorithms
and specialized software for PC are developed. Computer experiments showed the possibility of the real-time
modeling three-dimensional spectra of polyatomic molecules containing several tens of atoms.

INTRODUCTION 

—1

Recently, considerable advances have been made in
the experimental methods of molecular vibronic spec-
n »
troscopy. On the one hand, a very high resolution (
 cm
) of the vibrational structure in the spectra was
1
achieved in supersonic jets, and, on the other, modern
laser  methods  provide  the  observation  of  dispersive
spectra (ﬂuorescence from single excited vibronic lev-
els)  and  time-resolved  dynamic  spectra  of  molecules
excited by short (pico- and femtosecond) light pulses
(see, for example, [1–11]).

The modern vibronic spectroscopy is developing in
the direction of studies of the time-resolved line spec-
tra.  This  necessitates  the  development  of  the  corre-
sponding theory, computational methods, and the con-
struction of molecular models for the calculation, inter-
pretation, and prediction of such spectra and obtaining
from them information on the properties of molecules.

The conventional absorption and ﬂuorescence spec-
tra of polyatomic molecules have long been analyzed
theoretically. The theory was developed from the sim-
plest methods, which used various generalized spectral
parameters  (see,  for  example,  [12]),  to  the  methods
based  on  the  fundamental  molecular  model  and  its
parameters, which were not directly related to the spec-
tral  experiment  (potential  surfaces  of  the  ground  and
excited  states  in  natural  molecular  coordinates)  [13].
The  advantage  of  this  model  is  obvious,  because  it
allows one to describe not only spectral but also other
physicochemical  properties  of  polyatomic  molecules
(even, for example, the development of chemical reac-

tions [14, 15]). Within the framework of the parametric
theory  of  vibronic  spectra,  calculation  methods  were
developed  which  allow  one  to  construct  the  spectral
representation of the molecular model speciﬁed by a set
of parameters [16–19]. The second, no less important
problem, has also been solved, namely, the determina-
tion  of  parameters  of  the  potential  surfaces  of  mole-
cules in excited states [20].

This  provided  the  basis  for  the  formulation  and
solution of the problems of modeling and prediction of
one-quantum,  absorption,  and  ﬂuorescence  vibronic
spectra. It seems reasonable to develop this parametric
approach  for  modeling  the  time-resolved  spectra,
which obviously can give new information compared to
conventional vibronic spectra. However, at ﬁrst glance,
to  calculate  the  time-resolved  spectrum  of  a  complex
w
molecule, it is sufﬁcient to know all the probabilities 
ij
of vibronic transitions, which can be easily calculated
by the parametric method; nevertheless, the modeling
of  such  spectra  involves  a  number  of  problems  in
practice.

First, it is not clear to what degree the parameters of
a molecular model that were obtained (calibrated) for
the spectra of a certain type will be appropriate for a
quantitative  modeling  of  the  spectra  of  another  type
(time-resolved spectra).

Second, the inﬂuence of a medium (intermolecular
interactions) can substantially change the emission of
excited molecules. The problem arises as to how to sep-
arate the contributions from nonradiative and radiative
transitions to the time-resolved spectra.

Third,  processes  of  absorption  and  radiative  and
nonradiative relaxation in excited molecules can occur
not  only  inside  the  same  molecular  isomer  but  can
result  in  the  formation  of  other  isomers  (which  is,  in
particular, of great interest for photochemistry). There-
fore,  it  is  necessary  to  determine  the  probabilities  of
optical and nonradiative transitions between molecular
isomers.

Fourth,  a  purely  computational  problem  arises.  In
addition to the calculation of many probabilities 
 of

vibrational  and  vibronic  transitions  in  the  determina-
, it is

n
(

necessary to solve a system of linear differential equa-
3
) even for mol-
tions of a very high dimensionality (
>10
ecules  of  a  moderate  size  containing 
  atoms.
20—30
Although  the  general  methods  are  well  known,  the
applicability of the corresponding computational pro-
cedures  for  modeling  spectra  is  not  obvious  and
requires  a  special  analysis  (because  of  a  high  dimen-
sionality  of  the  problem  and  the  fast  computations
required).

)

t

At present, all these questions have no clear answer,
although  studies  are  being  performed  in  some  ﬁelds
(for  example,  nonradiative  transitions  [21],  probabili-
ties of optical transitions between isomers [13, 14], and
generalized inverse vibronic problems [22]). This paper
is  devoted  to  the  ﬁrst  part  of  the  general  problem,
namely, the solution of the direct problem of calcula-
tion  of  the  time-resolved  vibronic  spectrum  for  real
large  molecular  systems.  We  restrict  ourselves  to  the
case of an isolated molecule and transitions inside only
one molecular isomer.

PARAMETRIC APPROACH

An adequate choice of the parameters of a molecu-
lar model is very important in the solution of a direct
spectral problem.

Note that the excited-state lifetimes, decay rates for
individual lines in the spectrum, and the quantum yield
of ﬂuorescence are the key parameters (along with fre-
quencies and intensities of vibronic lines) in the analy-
sis  and  modeling  of  time-resolved  spectra  [23,  24].
These quantities, which determine the time dependence
of  the  ﬂuorescence  intensity  and  can  be  obtained
directly from experiments, are in fact the parameters of
a speciﬁc experiment rather than the parameters of the
molecular model. Knowing these parameters, one can
reproduce the experiment numerically, but it is impos-
sible to predict the behavior of another or the same mol-
ecule under different conditions. Such an approach is
incapable of predicting physicochemical properties of
molecules and is not constructive in this sense for the
development  of  methods  of  modeling  time-resolved
vibronic spectra of polyatomic molecules. 

We suggest using a parametric method, which was
developed  earlier  for  calculations  of  the  conventional
(not  time-resolved)  vibronic  spectra  of  polyatomic

molecules and is based on the fragmentary method of
formation of molecular models and a special system of
parameters  possessing  all  the  required  properties  [13,
20,  25].  The  essence  of  the  fragmentary  approach  is
that the calibration of the values of parameters of the
molecular fragments can be performed for the simplest
molecules  and  then  these  fragments  can  be  used  for
constructing models of more complex compounds and
predicting  their  spectra.  It  is  important  that  both  the
prediction  of  spectral  properties  and  the  development
of a system of parameters of model fragments are pre-
formed in the same experiments (absorption or ﬂuores-
cence).

The  main  idea  of  this  approach  is  to  calibrate  the
values of parameters of the molecular model (or frag-
ment)  in  the  simplest  experiment  (one-dimensional
absorption or ﬂuorescence spectrum) and then to pre-
dict  the  results  of  another,  more  complex,  time-
resolved  experiment,  which  describes  in  detail  the
dynamics of excited states and relaxation processes in
polyatomic molecules. This will allow one to use data
bases  for  molecular  fragments  [20,  25]  in  computer
experiments for direct calculations of multidimensional
spectra, which can be directly compared with the corre-
sponding real experiments, and to reﬁne the parameters
of  the  molecular  model.  The  computer  experiment
devoted to the study of the effect of various factors on
the  shape  of  the  time-resolved  spectrum  can  be  also
used  instead  of  real  experiments,  which  often  require
more complex equipment and are time-consuming.

It is clear that such an approach for modeling multi-
dimensional vibronic spectra can be realized in princi-
ple. The main problem, which determines the predic-
tive ability of this method, is the degree of transferabil-
ity of the parameters of molecular fragments used. As
for any parametric method, the answer to this question
can be obtained from model calculations of sufﬁciently
representative  series  of  molecules  and  comparison  of
the results with experiments (this question will be dis-
cussed  elsewhere).  Nevertheless,  one  can  already
expect the high efﬁciency of these models, taking into
account their good predictive ability in modeling con-
ventional IR and UV spectra of polyatomic molecules
[20, 25–27].

to  solve 

Along  with  a  choice  of  the  molecular  model,  it  is
the  computational  problems
necessary 
involved.  The  time-resolved  vibronic  ﬂuorescence
spectrum  can  be  represented  as  a  three-dimensional
surface—the dependence of the intensity on the emis-
sion frequency and the observation time. To construct
such  a  surface,  one  should  calculate  the  time  depen-
dence  of  the  intensity  of  each  spectral  line,  which  is
proportional to the probability 
w
 of the corresponding
ij
 and the
j

MODELING  OF  THE  TIME-RESOLVED VIBRONIC  SPECTRA 

201

Therefore,  to  calculate  a  three-dimensional  spectrum
for a speciﬁed molecular model, it is necessary, ﬁrst, to
determine the probabilities of vibrational and vibronic
transitions  between  all  energy  levels  of  the  molecule
and, second, by integrating kinetic equations, to obtain
the time dependences of populations of all levels and
intensities  of  spectral  lines.  Note  that  the  number  of
  of
vibronic  states,  which  affect  the  intensity 
spectral lines, can be very large for polyatomic mole-
cules (

Expressions (5) and (6) are convenient for the anal-
ysis  and  calculation  of  ni(t)  and  time  dependences  of
the spectral line intensities; however, they are substan-
tially restricted by the condition wk „
 wi, which is unac-
ceptable  for  the  methods  of  modeling  the  spectra  of
polyatomic molecules (see below). The solution in the
presence of multiple eigenvalues of the matrix P, i.e.,
for the same total probabilities of transitions from some
levels (wk = wi), can be similarly represented as a sum
of  the  products  of  exponentials  and  polynomials  in  t
with the corresponding recurrent relations for the coef-
ﬁcients; however, it is cumbersome. This solution can
be more easily obtained directly in the matrix form by
the  transformation  of  the  probability  matrix  P  to  the
canonical Jordan form [31].
Let the eigenvalues l

1, (cid:201), l
q be different among N
eigenvalues of the matrix P and the rest s eigenvalues
q + i (i = 1, 2, ..., s) be multiple with the multiplicity ri.
Then, the similarity transformation M—1PM = J reduces
the matrix P to the canonical Jordan form J = diag{J0,
J1,  (cid:201),  Js},  where  J0  is  the  diagonal  matrix  with  ele-
ments l

This method of integration of kinetic equations (2) is
general and allows one to obtain solutions for any prob-
ability matrix P. In speciﬁc calculations, two operations
of matrix multiplication should be performed for each
value of t, and the required calculation time, as can be
shown, is proportional to N3, which excludes the possi-
bility of the real time modeling of the spectra of poly-
atomic molecules with N > 103. In addition, note that
the computer calculation of the transformation matrix
(cid:140) for such large values of N is a nontrivial problem due
to  the  errors  in  rounding  off  real  numbers  and  the
necessity of storage of large data bases.

The use of the approximate numerical methods for
integrating kinetic equations (2), for example, based on
the  Eulerian  piecewise  linear  functions  method  [29],
seems the most promising. In this case, we obtain the
point representation for the solution on the discrete grid
tk in the form

Indeed, the rate of this iterative process is proportional
to N2 and the algorithm does not require the storage of
additional matrices except the matrix P itself. In addi-
tion, unlike the methods considered above, this method
does not involve rather slow computer calculations of
an exponential. Moreover, as the computer experiments
showed,  the  numerical  algorithm  can  be  additionally
optimized in rate by approximately two orders of mag-
nitude due to the direct use of the matrix P in the trian-
gle form and also automatic exclusion of kinetic equa-
tions with zero solutions for the speciﬁed initial condi-
tions.  For  this  reason,  the  efﬁciency  of  this  method
proves to be satisfactory in practice. However, the most
important  advantage  of  this  method  is  the  fact  that  it
yields the approximate solution of the system of kinetic
equations with any matrix P, in particular, in the case of
multiple eigenvalues, which, as we show below, is quite
real.

Let us analyze the solutions of kinetic equations for

some speciﬁc cases.

Consider ﬁrst the simplest nontrivial example of the
three-level system that has the ground state S0 and two
lowest  excited  electronic  states  S1  and  S2  (without
vibrational  sublevels).  In  this  case,  the  kinetic  equa-
tions have the form

Expression (8) describes a  simple exponential law
of the decrease in the population of the upper level S2
(Fig. 1). Therefore, the decay rate of ﬂuorescence I20(t)
and I21(t) is characterized, according to (1) and (8), by
a  single  quantity,  namely,  the  total  probability  w2  =
w20 + w21 of transitions from the S2 state. The depen-
dence I10(t) ~ n1(t) is biexponential (9) and is already
determined by two quantities, namely, the probabilities
w2 = w20 + w21 and w1 = w10 of transitions from the S2
and S1 levels. Similar results were obtained in papers
[23, 32].

Let us call attention to an important feature. The rate
of the exponential increase in population n1(t) of the S1
level  and,  hence,  the  intensity  I10(t)  of  the  S1 
  S0
transition is w+ = max(w1, w2), and the subsequent pop-
ulation  decay  occurs  with  the  rate  w—  =  min(w1,  w2).
This follows from the fact that the sign of the difference
w2  —  w1  in  expression  (9)  depends  on  the  relation
between the probabilities w1 and w2. One can see that
already in this simplest three-level case the time depen-
dence  of  the  ﬂuorescence  intensity  is  determined  not
only by the probability of the given transition, but also
by  the  probabilities  of  all  the  other  transitions.  For
example, for w1 > w2, the rate of the exponential decay
of  ﬂuorescence  intensity  I10(t)  will  be  determined  by
the total probability w2 = w20 + w21 of transitions from
the initially excited S2 state rather than by the probabil-
 S0 transition. In the multi-level system
ity of the S1 
containing  vibrational  levels  as  well,  the  situation  is
even  more  complicated  (see  below).  Therefore,  it  is
clear  that  a  detailed  and  correct  interpretation  of  the
experiment, the determination of constants characteriz-
ing the lifetimes of energy levels, etc., can only be per-
formed after the preliminary and detailed calculations
of the spectra.

In the general case, when a system has many excited

determined by expression (5) (or by a similar expres-
sion  containing  additional  polynomial  factors  of  t  in
terms  with  identical  total  probabilities  wi).  The  ﬁrst
term is responsible for the transitions from the ith level
to all the low-lying levels with the total probability wi =
 + wi0, which characterizes the rate of deple-
tion of this level. The rest of the terms contain in expo-
nents the total probabilities of transitions from the lev-
els lying above the ith level to this level. Therefore, the
time dependence of the population of the ith level and,
hence, of the intensity of transitions from this level is
determined  by  the  total  probabilities  wi  of  transitions
both from this level and by the probabilities wk of tran-

The total energy level diagram of a molecule can be

different  electronic  states.  Consider  the  ground  0  and
the ﬁrst excited 1 states of the molecule and their vibra-

tively (these subscripts denote sets of vibrational quan-
tum numbers). Let us calculate the total probabilities of

One can see from this expression that the total prob-
abilities  (inverse  lifetimes  of  the  sublevels)  for  all
vibrational sublevels of an electronic state are the same
and are determined by the parameters m
10 of the
electronic transition. This conclusion is important and
has been conﬁrmed experimentally [23].

10 and n

Consider now a system of three electronic states S0,
S1, and S2 with vibrational sublevels and vibronic tran-
sitions  between  them  (the  probabilities  of  vibrational
transitions  within  the  electronic  states  are  assumed
zero). Let the system be initially excited to the S2. Then,
the population of the sublevels of the intermediate state
S1 is described, according to (5), by the expression

because  the  population  of  the  levels  in  the  S1  state
increases only due to vibronic transitions from the S2
state (the probabilities of vibrational transitions within
the S1 state are very small and neglected). Because the
total probabilities for all the sublevels of the given elec-
tronic state are the same (w1, j = w1, w2, i = w2) (10), by
neglecting vibrational transitions, the system of kinetic
equations is separated into blocks, which correspond to
different  electronic  states.  The  total  probabilities  are
the same inside each block, and the equations are not
connected  with  each  other  and  are  solved  separately
(but  together  with  equations  for  other  blocks).  The
solutions  of  these  equations  are  proportional  to  the
same sum of exponentials. Therefore, we obtain for the
vibrational sublevels of the S1 state:

and the time dependences prove to be identical with an

MODELING  OF  THE  TIME-RESOLVED VIBRONIC  SPECTRA 

205

From this, a result follows that directly affects the
shape of the time-resolved spectrum: The time dynam-
ics of all vibrational lines of the S1 
 S0 electronic
transition is the same, it is biexponential, and is deter-
mined  by  the  total  probabilities  w1  and  w2,  while  the
intensities of the vibrational lines are determined by the
bij
 0, k  of  the
coefﬁcients 
vibronic transitions.

  and  probabilities  w1, j ﬁ

i

When  the  probabilities  of  vibrational  transitions
(within the given electronic state) are not zero, expres-
sions (10) and (11) are not valid in the general case and
the dynamics of vibrational sublevels of the same elec-
tronic  state  becomes  different. Therefore,  the  intensi-
ties of the vibrational lines of the S1 
 S0 transition
will  change  in  time  differently.  The  difference  in  the
time dependences of the intensities of vibrational lines
in the electronic spectrum is the criterion of a substan-
tial role of vibrational transitions in the dynamics of the
excited vibronic states of molecules and shows that the
probabilities of vibrational transitions are comparable
with those of vibronic transitions.

Upon  population  of  high  vibrational  levels  (over-
tones  and  combination  frequencies),  a  situation  can
arise in which the relaxation will occur via the vibra-
tional  states,  with  the  probabilities  of  transitions
between them being close or identical (for example, for
the  most  intense  vibrational  transitions  accompanied
by a change in one of the quantum numbers by unity).
In this case, the total probabilities (including also the
electronic component) will be the same for the nonzero
probabilities of vibrational transitions within electronic
states  as  well.  In  this  situation,  the  system  of  kinetic
equations  cannot  be  separated  into  blocks,  as  in  the
case  of  negligibly  small  probabilities  of  vibrational
transitions, and its matrix will have multiple eigenval-
ues, which requires the use of general methods for solv-
ing kinetic equations in calculations of the spectra.

One can expect that this will be most typical in the
analysis  of  the  time-resolved  ﬂuorescence  spectra  of
polyatomic molecules upon selective (resonance) exci-
tation of vibronic states. Therefore, the iterative method
of  numerical  integration  of  kinetic  equations  (2)
described above appears the most adequate. We devel-
oped a convenient calculation algorithm and a software
for  the  construction  of  three-dimensional  spectra  and
performing computer experiments with real molecules.
Figures  2  and  3  illustrate  the  spectra  calculated  upon
selective excitation of different vibronic states of mod-
els  of  hexatriene  and  octatetraene  molecules.  The
results  of  a  series  of  computer  experiments  and  their
detailed discussion will be reported elsewhere. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Thus,  the  problem  of  modeling  time-resolved
vibronic spectra of polyatomic molecules can be solved
using  the  parametric  method  and  molecular  models,

OPTICS AND  SPECTROSCOPY      Vol.  90      No.  2      2001

which  were  developed  earlier  for  the  calculation  and
prediction of conventional absorption and ﬂuorescence
spectra  of  polyatomic  molecules.  All  the  required
matrix  elements  can  be  calculated  by  the  methods
developed.  The  method  of  numerical  integration  of  a
system of many (N > 103) kinetic equations is the most
efﬁcient  for  determining  the  time  dependences  of  the
populations of vibronic levels.

We realized the parametric method of modeling the
time-resolved  vibronic  spectra  of  polyatomic  mole-
cules  in  the  form  of  special  software  for  a  PC.  The
three-dimensional  spectra  were  calculated  for  mole-
cules of polyenes and diphenylpolyenes under different
excitation  conditions  and  for  different  parameters  of
molecular models. The calculations showed the possi-
bility  of  performing  real  time  computer  experiments
with  polyatomic  molecules  containing  several  tens  of
atoms.

The analysis of kinetic equations showed, in partic-
ular, that the time dependence of the intensity of vibra-
tional lines (which is many-exponential in the general
case) can be used for estimating the role of vibrational
transitions in the dynamics of excited vibronic states.
The  direct  calculation  and  modeling  of  these  spectra
allow one to separate radiative and nonradiative contri-
butions to the probabilities of the corresponding transi-
tions,  which  is  important  in  the  development  of  the
models of intermolecular interactions and the theory of
nonradiative transitions [21].

We restricted ourselves to the processes caused by
the  vibronic  transitions  occurring  within  the  same
molecular  isomer.  In  the  general  case,  processes  of
optical excitation and relaxation can result in the tran-
sitions  to  other  molecular  isomers,  which  is  of  great
interest, in particular, for photochemistry. We intend to
study these processes in the future. After the develop-
ment  of  the  methods  for  calculating  probabilities  of
vibronic transitions between isomers [14], this method
can be easily extended to the general case. Note that the
simulation of three-dimensional spectra neglecting the
transitions between isomers and their comparison with
experiments can already give the information that will
be useful for the development of the theory of optically
induced  transitions  between  isomers  of  polyatomic
molecules.

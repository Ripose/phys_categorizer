We  study  optical  solitons  in  chirped  periodic  optical  lattices  whose  amplitude  or 

frequency  changes  in  the  transverse  direction.  We  discover  that  soliton  propagation  in 

such  lattices  can  be  accompanied  by  the  progressive  self-bending  of  the  soliton 

trajectory,  and  we  show  that  the  soliton  bending  rate  and  output  position  can  be 

controlled  by  varying  the  lattice  depth,  as  well  as  the  chirp  amplitude  and  frequency 

modulation  rate.  This  effect  has  potential  applications  for  controllable  soliton  steering 

and routing.

Micro-structured  optical  devices  (e.g.,  chirped  fiber  Bragg  gratings  and  mirrors, 

arrayed waveguide gratings) are effective tools for the generation and processing of ultra-

short optical pulses (see, e.g., Refs 1-2 and papers quoted therein). Such devices found 

applications in many settings, including wavelength-stabilized lasers, Raman amplifiers, 

phase conjugators, passive optical networks, or dispersion compensators.3,4 For example, 

properly  designed  chirped  gratings  can  be  used  to  compensate  the  group  velocity 

mismatch  experienced  by  waves  of  different  frequencies.  The  close  analogy  between 

dispersion  and  diffraction  effects  suggests  that  ideas  born  in  ultrafast  optics  might  be 

transferred from a time-domain to a space-domain in order to control diffraction of laser

beams, in particular, to manage dynamics and properties of spatial solitons. This can be 

accomplished in periodic waveguide arrays with controllable refractive index modulation 

depth  and  waveguide  separation,  a  feature  made  possible  by  the  advent  of  optically-

induced  lattices  in  photorefractive  media.5-13  The  diffractive  properties  of  such  lattices 

can be tuned to a great extent by varying intensity of light waves employed to induce 

them, thus opening a promising avenue for spatial soliton control concepts like radiative 

switching and parametric steering.14-18 

The  recent,  previous  studies  of  this  possibility  addressed  periodic  (unchirped) 

lattices  with  the  constant  refractive  index  modulation  depth.  In  this  paper  we  uncover 

additional possibilities for soliton control that are accessible with periodic lattices whose 

amplitude or frequency is modulated linearly in the transverse direction. We show that 

soliton  propagation  in  such  lattice  is  accompanied  by  progressive  light  bending  in  the 

direction of growth of the lattice amplitude or decrease of its local frequency. The soliton 

bending  and  consequently  the  output  soliton  position  can  be  controlled  by  varying  the 

lattice  depth,  its  spatial  frequency,  and  the  amplitude  or  frequency  modulation  rate,  a 

feature with direct potential applications for controllable soliton steering and switching. 

We consider propagation of optical radiation along the 

ξ

 axis in cubic nonlinear 

medium with modulation of linear refractive index along transverse

photorefractive  media,  with  several  interfering  plane  waves.  The  technique  of  optical 

lattice induction provides an important possibility to tune lattice parameters, including 

depth  and  frequency  of  the  refractive  index  modulation.  We  assume  that  the  depth  of 

the refractive index modulation is small compared to the unperturbed index and is of the 

order of the nonlinear correction to the refractive index due to the Kerr effect, so that 

lattices  addressed  here  are  relatively  shallow  and  thus,  in  general,  the  tight-binding 

approximation  can  not  be  applied  for  their  analysis.  Eq.  (1)  admits  several  conserved 

quantities, including the power, or energy flow,

stationary solution  w

 yields a linear eigenvalue problem that we solved numerically. 

Here we are interested only in the simplest ground-state soliton solutions. 

 

The  salient  properties  of  solitons  supported  by  AM  lattices  are  summarized  in 

Fig.  1.  The  energy  flow U   is  a  nonmonotonic  function  of  the  propagation  constant  b  

(Fig.  1(a)).  There  exist  a  lower  propagation  constant  cutoff  b   for  soliton  existence. 

co

Physically  this  cutoff  arises  due  to  the  competition  between  the  harmonic  refractive 

index  modulation  and  the  linear  increase  of  lattice  amplitude  at 

η → ∞

.  Actually,  in 

the  absence  of  the  harmonic  modulation  (

0)

  a  soliton  launched  into  a  nonlinear 

ηΩ =

medium  with  α

0≠

  would  travel  towards  the  positive  direction  of  the  η   axis  (in  the 

direction  of  increase  of  the  refractive  index),  while  harmonic  modulation  introduces  a 

potential  barrier  that  prevents  soliton  from  traveling  and  makes  possible  the  very 

 

3

existence  of  stationary  soliton  solutions  in  AM  lattices.  Such  potential  barrier  arises 

because of the nonlinearity of the medium response and does not exist in linear lattices, 

where  progressive  coupling  of  light  into  regions  with  higher  refractive  index  is 

unavoidable. Since the height of the potential barrier in the nonlinear lattice depends on 

the  energy  flow  and  on  the  width  of  the  beam,  low-energy  stationary  solitons  are  not 

supported  by  lattices;  hence,  the  existence  of  a  lower  cutoff.  The  cutoff  monotonically 

increases with increase of lattice depth (Fig. 1(b)) and linear amplitude modulation rate 

(Fig. 1(c)). At high energy flow levels soliton profiles almost symmetric, while close to 

the  cutoff  for  existence  they  are  distorted  toward  regions  with  higher  refractive  index 

(Fig. 1(d)).  

The  outcome  (numerical)  of  the  linear  stability  analysis  revealed  that  ground-

state  solitons  are  stable  almost  in  the  entire  domain  of  their  existence  except  for  the 

narrow region near the cutoff where  dU

/

db ≤

0

. This can be viewed as a confirmation 

of  the  applicability  of  Vakhitov-Kolokolov  stability  criterion  for  ground-state  soliton 

solutions  of  Eq.  (1).  For  a  fixed  set  of  parameters 

, 
α p

,  and 

ηΩ   the  properties  of 

solitons  depend  also  on  the 

η

-location  of  its  intensity  maximum.  In  particular,  the 

propagation  constant  cutoff  b   is  higher  for  solitons  whose  centers  are  shifted  in  the 

co

positive direction of the 

η

-axis. Nevertheless, we found that the qualitative character of 

dependencies  U b ,

  are  not  affected  by  the  position  of  the  soliton 

center as long as

The most interesting situation arises when the energy flow of the input beam is 

not  sufficient  for  formation  of  stationary  soliton  for  a  given  width  and  lattice 

parameters.  In  this  case  the  periodic  modulation  cannot  prevent  beam  from  bending 

toward  region  with  higher  refractive  index,  but  in  contrast  to  medium  with  linearly 

growing refractive index  (

ηΩ =

0)

, the bending rate of beam inside the lattice depends 

on  its  frequency  and  depth  (Fig.  2).  This  opens  the  possibility  for  control  of  output 

beam center position by tuning the parameters of the lattice, a goal that can be easily 

realized in the case of optically-induced lattices.  

Next we study the propagation of beams traveling across the lattice. We solve Eq. 

(1)  with  the  input  conditions 

q

sech( )exp(
η

i η
ν

)

,  where  ν   is  the  incident  angle. 

= =
0

ξ

This  choice  of  the  input  conditions  is  justified  since  it  corresponds  to  exact  soliton 

solution  in  the  homogeneous  case  and  enables  to  minimize  the  radiative  losses  at  the 

 

4

initial  stage  of  propagation.  Suppression  of  radiative  losses  is  directly  connected  with 

enhanced  mobility  of  such  broad  input  beams  that  cover  several  lattice  periods.  Note 

that the trajectory of broad traveling beam is almost parabolic, beam does not broaden 

upon  propagation  since  nonlinearity  compensates  diffraction  (in  this  sense,  such 

traveling  beam  are  called  soliton),  and  radiation  that  unavoidably  arises  when  soliton 

crosses  lattice  channels  is  weak  if  local propagation angle with respect to 

ξ

 axis is far 

from Bragg angle. It should be pointed out that the propagation trajectories of narrow 

input  beams,  whose  width  is  comparable  with  the  lattice  period,  may  depart 

considerably from parabolic ones. We did not observe periodic Bloch oscillations that are 

known to occur in discrete waveguide arrays with linearly increasing refractive index in 

neighboring waveguides.

19,20 In contrast, soliton beam was found to be destroyed when its 

local  propagation  angle  approached  the  Bragg  one.  This  is  because  of  the  peculiar 

difference  between  the  structure  of  AM  lattice addressed here and waveguide arrays of 

Refs  [19,20],  whose  profiles  incorporate  the  sum  of  linear  and  periodic  refractive  index 

modulation.  An  increase  in  lattice  amplitude  modulation  rate  leads  to  monotonic 

increase of soliton bending rate (Fig. 2(a)). The shift of integral soliton center, defined 

as: 

 

 

 

 

δη

q d

at 

ξ =

 is a nonmonotonic function of modulation frequency (Fig. 2(b)). At 

Ω

η <

6

 

the  input  beam  forms  stationary  immobile  soliton,  while  at 

Ω

η >

6

  it  starts  to  travel 

across the lattice and bending rate reaches its maximal value for 

Ω ≈
η

7.2

. The rate of 

bending monotonically decreases as  Ω →  that is consistent with the fact that broad 

η ∞

solitons are almost unaffected by high-frequency refractive index modulation. The soliton 

center  shift  increases  as  p   (Fig.  2(c))  that  can  be  viewed  as  another  manifestation  of 

2

controlled bending afforded by AM lattices. Finally, the possible propagation trajectories 

can be enriched by launching soliton at nonzero angle  ν  with respect to the lattice (Fig. 

2(d)). Thus, for high enough negative  ν  soliton can penetrate the area 

<
η −

1/

α

 where 

it will experience bending in negative direction of  η  axis. As one can see from Figs. 2(a) 

and 2(d), the soliton center shift can be quite considerable (of the order of several soliton

.  Notice  that  in  photorefractive  crystals 

used  for  experimental  generation  of  optical  lattices,

observable in such crystals.

 (Fig. 3(a)). As in the case of AM lattices the shift of 

soliton  center  location  along  η -axis  does  not  qualitatively  affect  soliton  properties. 

Despite  the  fact  that  optical-induction  of    FM  lattices  is  not  obvious,  they  offer  a 

number of unique opportunities for soliton steering, since widths of guiding channels in 

such lattices change in transverse direction, so that soliton mobility changes across the 

lattice.  A  soliton

  averaged  over  fast  oscillations  and, 

therefore,  experiences  attraction  to  the  zero-frequency  point 

η

−

1/ 2

α

  (Fig.  3(c)). 

Intuitively, such soliton starts to travel across the lattice in the direction of decrease of 

local  frequency  and  finally  can  be  trapped  in  the  guiding  lattice  channel  whose  width 

somehow  matches  the  soliton  width.  The  distance  where  trapping  occurs  rapidly 

decreases  with  increase  of  lattice  depth,  while  the  position  of  output  channel  remains 

unchanged (Fig. 3(c)). Note that soliton never passes the point 

η

=

−

1/ 2

α

, where local 

frequency  of  the  lattice  goes  to  zero.  Finally,  by  changing  the  incident  angle 

ν

  it  is 

possible  to  address  the  output  guiding  channel  at  different  propagation  distances  (Fig. 

3(d)). The potential of the scheme for spatial soliton manipulation is clearly apparent. 

 

We  thus  conclude  stressing  that  we  have  exposed  that  the  amplitude  and 

frequency  modulation  of  transversally-chirped  photonic  lattices  offers  important  new 

opportunities for the diffraction control and soliton steering. The key feature uncovered 

here  is  the  possibility  to  control  the  soliton  mobility  across  the  lattice  by  proper 

selection of the chirp modulation rate and the overall lattice parameters.

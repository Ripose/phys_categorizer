Abstract.  We  consider  the  problem  of  mobility  and  localization  of  hydrogen  atoms  in  the 

Te(OH)6 crystals. The model of particles moving in a rapidly oscillating field was used.  

 

Modern methods for studying vibronic coupling are mostly based on the approaches to the effect 

of  Jahn-Teller  electronic  degeneration  (effect  and  pseudo-effect).  According  to  these  approaches, 

displacement of heavy atoms and structural distortion in high symmetry systems are caused by the 

interaction  between  the  ground  and  the  nearest  excited  electronic  states.  The  Möller-Plesset 

quantum-chemical  method  makes  another  approach  for  studying  vibronic  interactions  to  take  into 

account higher-order electronic excitations in multielectronic systems [1].  Moreover the combine of  

the  Möller-Plesset  quantum-chemical  method  with  the  model  moving  of  particle  in  a  rapidly 

oscillating  field  [2]  the  mobility  and  localization  of  hydrogen  atoms,  phase  transition,  structural 

distortion in the crystals Н2С4О4 were investigated [3]. Here we consider  the problem of mobility 

and localization of hydrogen atoms  in the crystals of  the acid Te(OH)6.  

H6TeO6  [or Te(OH)6]  crystals are characterized by polymorphism and have molecular structure 

type    as  for  monoclinic  modification  (space  group  P21/n  with  Z  =  4  molecules  in  a  cell),  and  for 

cubic modification (space group F4132; Z = 32). Molecule Te(OH)6 has the deformed structure of an 
octahedron  with  Oi-Te-Oj  valent  angles  not  equal  90o.  The  feature  of  the  deformed  structure  of 

molecules  Te(OH)6  remains  not  clear.  Other  feature  is  absence  of  hydrogen  diffusion  down  to 

temperature of melting (395 K) [4,5].  

On  the  other  hand,  similar  molecules    –  molybdic  (H6МоO6,  H4МоO5  etc.),  tungstic  (H4WO5, 

.nH2O  and  WО3

H6WO6  etc.)  are  qualified  as  virtual  objects.  They  exist  only  in  the  form  of  crystallohydrates  
.nH2O,  n≈1;2).  This  distinction  associates  with  distinction  of  the  d-orbitals 
(МоО3
filling: the d-orbitals of ions Те6+ are filled [configuration Te (4d10)], whereas 4d-and 5d-orbitals of 
ions Мо6+ and W6+  [configurations Мо(4d0) and W(5d0)] remain vacant.

Computational and experimental details 

The  electronic  structure,  the  bonding  energy,  and  the  geometry  of  M(OH)6  (M  =  Te,  Mo,  W)  

molecules  were  studied  by  the  ab  initio  RHF  (restricted  Hartree-Fock)  and  LMP2  (second-order 

local Möller-Plesset) methods by the program Jaguar 5.5 [6]. The atomic basis 6-31G (p,d) was used 

for H and O [7], and the quasi-relativistic basis Lavcp [8] for the heavy atom Te, Mo and W. The 

bonding energy of the M(OH)6 molecules  formation was determined as ∆ = E - Σ, where E is the 
energy of the M(OH)6 molecule and Σ is the total energy of  the atoms M0, 6O0, and 6H0. 

The  mobility  of  hydrogen  atoms  was  studied  by  the  1H  NMR  method  in  the  Te(OH)6 
polycrystals. 1H NMR spectra were registered by a Bruker 300 NMR spectrometer in a temperature 

range of 160-400 K. 

Computing results  

Computing by Jaguar 5.5 package used the Oh symmetry as the starting geometry for a M(OH)6 

molecules.  In  the  Hartree-Fock  approximation,  the  Oh  symmetry  persisted  during  the  geometry 

optimization.  Computing  by  the  LMP2  method  showed  that  the  Oh  symmetry  of  M(OH)6 

transformed  into  the  C1  symmetry,  in  compliance  with  experimental  data  of  Te(OH)6  structure 

(Table 1, Fig. 1). The contributions of electronic correlations to the bond energy (δ) of the deformed 

M(OH)6 molecule are represented in Table 2.

A model of hydrogen atoms moving  

To  investigate  the  effect  of  electronic  correlations  on  the  dynamics  of  hydrogen  atoms,  we 

considered  a  problem  of  particles  moving  in  a  rapidly  oscillating  field.  The  effective  potential  of 

energy for this system is given by [2]: 

Ueff = U1 + U2 = A[−cos(ϕ−ϕo)+π2((d.νocs )/(D.νlibr))2sin2(ϕ−ϕo)],                           (1) 

 
where A is the energy constant which depends from environment; νlibr = 4,2.1013 Hz  is the libration 

frequency  of  OH-  groups,  νocs  is  the  frequency  of  electronic  correlations  defined  by  correlation 
interactions  (νocs = δ/n ~ 1015 Hz, where n = 6 - number of OH-groups, Table 2), d is the amplitude 

of fluctuations of electronic density for the oxygen atoms, D is the O-H distance, ϕ is the angle of 

deflection from the equilibrium, ϕo is the equilibrium angle M-O-H (Table 1). Valent oscillations of 

OH-groups were neglected. U1 in (1) may be considered as the analog of the Hartree-Fock potential, 

U2 describes the influence of the electronic correlations on the mobility of hydrogen atom. Table 3 

images specific parameters of the model. Ueff shows one equilibrium position for the hydrogen atom 

of  Te(OH)6  molecule  and  two  equilibrium  positions  for  the  hydrogen  atoms  of  Mo(OH)6  and 

W(OH)6 molecules  (Fig. 2). The possibility of hydrogen diffusion is testified by the double minima 

potential curve.  Therefore the proton exchange is conceivable for Mo(OH)6 and W(OH)6 and  the 

proton exchange is not conceivable for Te(OH)6.

1Н NMR data 

Figure 3 images 1Н NMR data including experimentally registered second moments. The slight 
decrease in the 1Н NMR second moments (or line width) with temperature is indicative the absent of 

the diffusion of hydrogen atoms. This is agreement with the calculated model.

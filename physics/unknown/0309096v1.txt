ABSTRACT 

Both the lack of nutrient supply and rising mechanical stress exerted by the microenvironment 

appear  to  be  able  to  cause  discrepancies  between  the  actual,  observed  tumor  mass  and  that 

predicted  by  West  et  al.’s  universal  growth  model  [Nature,  314,  628  (2001)].  Using  our 

previously developed model we demonstrate here, that (1) solid tumor growth and cell invasion 

are linked, not only qualitatively but also quantitatively, that (2) the onset of invasion marks the 

time point when the tumor’s cell density exceeds a compaction maximum, and that (3) tumor cell 

invasion,  reduction  of  mechanical  confinement  and  angiogenesis  can  act  synergistically  to 

increase  the  actual  tumor  mass  m  towards  the  level 

Wm   predicted  by  West  et  al.’s  universal 

growth  curve.  These  novel  insights  have  important  implications  for  experimental  and  clinical 

cancer research alike.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

Volumetric  growth  and  tissue  invasion  are  hallmarks  of  highly  malignant  solid  cancers.  For 

multicellular brain tumor spheroids cultured in vitro within a three-dimensional gel environment, 

we already suggested a quantitative linkage between these key-features [1], yet to our knowledge 

experimental evidence at the in vivo scale is still missing. As a follow up work, we have recently 

proposed [2,3] a novel tumor growth model based on West et al.’s universal growth law [4]. Our 

numerical  fitting  results  show  that,  using  experimental  spheroid  data  from  the  literature, 

malnourishment and confining mechanical stress can considerably reduce the actual tumor mass 

m.  

Using  this  new  mathematical  model  and  based  on  the  concept  that  there  should  be  a 

maximum  tumor  cell  density, Maxρ ,  i.e.  that  there  is  a  compaction  threshold  beyond  which  the 

cell  density  (i.e.,  the  tumor  cell  mass  per  unit  volume  v)  cannot  be  increased  any  further,  we 

present  in  here  the  following  arguments:  (a)  a  possibility  for  tumor  mass  m  to  reach  its 

asymptotic  M,  is  by  reducing  the  tumor  cell  densityρ  once  its  critical  threshold, Maxρ ,  is 

exceeded,  (b)  the  biological  equivalent  for  the  reduction  of  cell  density  ρ  is  the  onset  of  cell 

invasion,  linked  therefore  to  the  density  threshold Maxρ ,  (c)  since  we  argue  that ρand  invasion 

are  connected,  and  ρ  is  linked  to  v,  volumetric  growth  and  invasion  should  be  linked  as  well 

through ρ,  (d)  the  earlier  the  onset  of  cell  invasion,  the  faster  the  tumor’s  volumetric  growth 

rate,  and  finally,  (e)  tumor  cell  invasion  acts  synergistically  to  increase  nutrient  supply  and 

reduce mechanical resistance. Thus we combine here for the first time the cancerous key-features 

of growth and invasion, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and confirm the concept presented 

earlier in [1].

In  the  following  we  will  briefly  describe  the  relevant  modeling  steps  together  with  the 

mathematical background for our argumentation.  

2. THE MODEL 

From  the  original  West  et  al.’s  law  of  energy  conservation  [4]  it  follows  that,  under  ideal 

environmental  conditions  (i.e.,  fully  replenished  nutrient  sources  and  in  the  absence  of 

mechanical  stress), 

the  dynamics  of 

tumor  mass  growth  m  can  be  described  by

,  where  p  is  a  parameter  whose  value  must  be  experimentally  ascertained 

(West  et  al  assume  p  =  3/4).  The  parameters  a  and  b  represent  the  rates  of  metabolism  and 

nutrients intake, respectively [3]. Let M represent the maximum body size attainable at the zero 

growth  point 

dm

the impact of increasing mechanical stress exerted by the microenvironment, it is more realistic 

to  assume  that  proliferating  solid  tumors  exhibit  some  ability  to  be  compacted,  if  not 

compressed,  under  mechanical  stress,  so  that  the  cell  density  ρ  varies  over  time.  As  a 

consequence,  the  variable  of  interest  is  no  longer  the  tumor  mass  m,  but  the  tumor

growth  dynamics  are  assumed 

to  return 

to 

its  fixed  point  under

due 

to 

rising  mechanical 

stresses,

Maxρρ→

and

,  Eq.  (3)  has  the  simple  asymptotic  solution

z =

f

.  Thus,  as  the 

system  asymptotically  approaches  equilibrium  at  zero  growth  point,  it  can  be  readily  verified 

that

v

V

1(

.  Note  the  distinction  between  the  ‘stree-free’  equilibrium  of  West  et  al. 

with f = 0, and the asymptotic equilibrium with f > 0. The former essentially serves as the ‘upper 

limit’ of the latter beyond which tumor volume cannot be increased any further.  

 

The  above  results  have  been  derived  without  considering  invasion  explicitly.  It  is 

apparent  however,  that  when  the  tumor  cell  density  has  reached  its  maximum  threshold  level, 

proliferative  growth  activity  would  come  to  a  complete  halt  if  invasion  would  not  take  place 

since further compaction to accommodate more daughter cells is no longer possible. Indeed, Eq. 

(2) implies that under rising pressure of compaction, as

1→f

, tumor growth becomes negative 

at  the  rate  of

vbρ−

,  unless  tumor  cell  invasion  starts  to  take  off  and  hence  alleviates  the 

pressures from mechanical confinements. In the following, let us therefore consider the case in 

which the onset of invasion is triggered when tumor cell density reaches its maximum threshold 

level.  

Realistically,  many  solid  malignant  cancers  consist  of  heterogeneous  clonal  sub-

populations.  As  such,  we  first  need  to  establish  geography  in  the  form  of  a  spatially 

heterogeneous  landscape,  with  the  heterogeneity  due  to  differential  cellular  density  (e.g.,  as  a 

consequence  of  different  clonal  cell  proliferation  rates).  In  modeling  terms,  such  a  “rugged” 

landscape  is  characterized  by  the  interwoven  pattern  of  “peaks”  corresponding  to  maximum-

 

6

Thomas S. Deisboeck et al. “Indications for a Quantitative Link between Tumor Growth and Invasion” 

density  regions  and  “valleys”  representing  low-density  areas.  Next,  suppose  that  the  tumor 

landscape  can  be  broken  down  into  a  countable  collection  of  locations,  L.  The  state  of  each 

location

L∈l

 depends on its onsite level of cellular density,

ρ ∈
l

,0[

Maxρ

]

. Define the set A as 

the set of all locations exhibiting maximum density,

SA

=⊂

:{
l

ρρ =

}

.  

Using computer visualization methods for data derived from a microscopic brain tumor 

growing within a three-dimensional biogel environment, Mojsilovic et al. [5] already described a 

regional onset of invasion from areas of high (proliferative) cell density. Based on this finding, 

we then introduce the critical assumption that the probability of cell invasion is monotonically 

linked to the onsite cell density level. In particular, the onset of invasion is triggered with high 

probability,

Prob I
)(

,  whenever 

the 

cell  density 

reaches 

its  maximum 

threshold 

l

level,

Prob →I
l

)(

as

Maxρρ →

l

.  This  means  that  the  set  A  contains  all  the  maximum-density 

locations that serve as launching pads for tumor cell invasion. In this case, proliferative growth 

activity is not necessarily halted when cell density reaches its threshold level. Rather, invasion 

launched  from  those  maximum-density  locations  allows  tumor  cells  to  migrate  to  more 

permissive  areas  with  low  levels  of  mechanical  confinements,  which  in  turn  stimulates  new 

proliferative growth activities.  

With invasion, for the entire tumor system to converge to its asymptotic equilibrium M, 

eventually  both  the  overall  proliferative  activity  (i.e.,  the  tumor’s  growth  fraction)  and  cell 

invasion should experience a significant slowing down. Hence at equilibrium, we assume that the 

tumor’s  asymptotic  cell  density  approaches  a  level  that  is  strictly  lower  than  the  maximum 

threshold, i.e.,

,ρρρ
<→ ∞

  as 

∞→t

. A biological mechanism that could account 

for  this  behavior  would  be  the  volume  expansion  of  edema  fluid  surrounding  the  main  tumor 

mass,  such  as  in  the  case  of  highly  malignant  brain  tumors.  While  the  tumor  mass  m  is  kept

constant at it asymptotic value M, its volume v increases and thus the tumor density ρ decreases, 

which in turn would slow down invasion.  

To solve for the fixed point solution, set

 in Eq. (3). The asymptotic 

tumor volume,  ∞v , can then be easily derived for the case involving invasion as follows:

. Otherwise, if regions with

equilibrium, invasion is triggered again with

 close to one and hence that stage cannot

correspond  to  a  fixed  point.  Therefore,  due  to  the  critical  link  between  tumor  growth  and 

invasion,  the  asymptotic  total  tumor  volume, ∞v ,  will  be  significantly  higher  than  in  the  no-

invasion  case: 

v

  precisely  because

.  Thus,  Eq.  (4)  allows  for  the 

possibility  that,  if  an  experimental  (in  vitro  or  in  vivo)  setup  explicitly  allows  for  invasion  to 

occur, the actual tumor mass m may grow to the level predicted by the universal growth model of 

 

3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  

West  et  al.’s  universal  growth  model  [4]  appears  to  be  applicable  not  only  to  a  variety  of 

organisms but also to solid tumor growth [2]. In some instances, however, there is a discrepancy 

between the actual, observed tumor mass m and the level  Wm  predicted by the universal growth 

8

 

 

West et al.  

  

 

 

 

Thomas S. Deisboeck et al. “Indications for a Quantitative Link between Tumor Growth and Invasion” 

curve.  Using  experimental  in  vitro  data  from  the  literature  we  recently  found  that,  both 

malnourishment  and  the  mechanical  stress  exerted  by  the  tumor’s  microenvironment  can 

contribute to a lower tumor mass m [3]. Hence conversely, both an increase in nutrient supply 

and a reduction in mechanical resistance should result in an upward shifting of the tumor growth 

curve, thus reducing the m- Wm discrepancy [6]. 

Based on this previous work we argue in here further, that it is reasonable to assume that 

the  extent  of  (interstitial)  cell  compaction  is  finite.  As  such,  there  should  be  a  maximum  cell 

density, Maxρ ,  for  any  particular  solid  cancer  type.  Furthermore,  since

t =ρ
)(

tm

tv
)(/)(

,  any 

increase in m without a concomitant increase in v will lead to an increase in ρ. Concomitant or 

not,  once Maxρ is  reached,  every  additional  increase  in  the  tumor  mass  m  as  a  result  of 

proliferative  activity would  have  to  trigger  an  increase  in v  to  keep  the  tumor  cell  density  at  a 

level

Maxρ<

.  One  could  therefore  argue  that  maintaining  cell  density  at  a  relatively  low  level, 

Maxρρ<

, is a driving force for rapid volumetric expansion of the tumor in a pre-invasive stage. 

However,  within  any  confined  three-dimensional  microenvironment,  one  can  expect  that 

eventually  there  are  limits  for  volumetric  expansion.  At  this  point,  the  options  for  the  tumor 

system  in  order  to  sustain  continuous  growth  are:  (a)  reducing  the  microenvironmental 

mechanical resistance and thus enabling continued volumetric growth; (b) reducing its own local 

cell  density, ρ,  through  activation  of  cell  motility  into  the  adjacent  tissue,  and  (c)  both.  Tissue 

invasion  is  mediated  through  the  cells’  secretion  of  matrix  degrading  enzymes,  so  called 

proteases,  therefore  is  a  disruptive  process  in  nature.  It  is  then  reasonable  to  assume  that  cell 

invasion  weakens  tissue  consistency  adjacent  to  the  main  tumor,  thus  reduces  the  mechanical 

resistance and therefore contributes to a decreasing mechanical confinement for the proliferative 

tumor core. It is noteworthy, that in this concept angiogenesis would enable further volumetric 

 

9

Thomas S. Deisboeck et al. “Indications for a Quantitative Link between Tumor Growth and Invasion” 

growth  and  both,  fractal  vessel  architecture  as  well  as  increased  tissue  edema  (e.g.,  through  a 

‘leaking’ blood-brain barrier, in the case of malignant brain tumors) would likely contribute to a 

more sustained reduction in mechanical confinement.  

We therefore propose that tumor cell invasion is triggered once the maximum cell density 

is reached. It then follows that since v and ρ are linked, and since we connect  Maxρ to (the onset 

of) tumor cell invasion, volumetric tumor growth and cell invasion should be linked as well. We 

can thus advance the following hypothesis: in an experimental setup that allows for invasion to 

occur,  i.e.,  in  specific  in  vitro  [1],  in  vivo,  and  clinical  settings,  we  may  observe  the  shifting 

upwards of the tumor-mass actual growth curve due to this mechanical pressure-reducing effect 

of  cell  invasion.  The  upward  shifting  of  the  tumor  growth  curve  can  elevate  the  tumor  mass 

to Wm ,  i.e.,  the  levels  predicted  by  West  et  al.’s  universal  growth  curve.  Therefore,  in  an 

experimental  or  clinical  setup  that  concomitantly  examines  both  tumor  cell  proliferation  and 

invasion  we  may  observe  a  growth  curve  that  fits  the  prediction  of  West  et  al.’s  model  more 

accurately. 

One  can  further  argue  that  within  tissue  types  and  areas  of  rather  high  mechanical 

confinement  volumetric  growth  should  quickly  reach  its  limits  and  thus  cell  density  must 

approach Maxρ fast. This in turn should trigger a comparatively early onset of invasion, arguably 

rendering the tumor more aggressive. It further follows that the earlier this onset of invasion is, 

the faster the resulting volumetric tumor growth rate will be and in addition, the faster will the 

tumor mass m reach its asymptotic level M. Since this accelerated volumetric growth demands 

higher  nutrient  supply  and  since  invasive  cells  reduce  tissue  resistance  also  for  blood  vessel 

formation,  i.e.  for  approaching  endothelial  cells,  it  may  trigger  an  early  onset  of  metastasis  as 

well, depending on the cancer type. We note that although the onset of invasion may at least in 

 

10

Thomas S. Deisboeck et al. “Indications for a Quantitative Link between Tumor Growth and Invasion” 

part be mechanically triggered (i.e., passive), this infiltrative process should be facilitated by an 

alternation  in  the  cancer  cells’  gene-expression  profile  (e.g.,  producing  proteases  and 

extracellular matrix proteins) enabling an active phenotypic ‘switch’. It is further noteworthy that 

we have introduced geographical heterogeneity in the form of distinct cell densities, which can 

be  generated  by  variations  in  cellular  proliferation  rates  due  to  the  tumor’s  genetic  instability. 

These  cancerous  subpopulations  or  clonal  surface  regions  with  high  cell  density  may  then 

function  as  “launching  pads”  for  further  tumor  cell  invasion,  in  turn  enabling  these  regions  to 

grow  faster  volumetrically  than  the  low-density  areas.  As  such,  this  recurrent  “proliferation-

migration-proliferation”  sequence  creates  a  closed  feedback  loop,  which  appears  to  favor  the 

competitive  selection  of  more  aggressive  (i.e.  faster  growing  and  faster  invading)  cell  clones 

throughout  the  tumor  surface.  Thus,  our  theoretical  framework  here  may  also  lead  to  novel 

insights into the process of tumor progression. 

Our  conclusions  may  therefore  have  clinical  implications.  Most  importantly,  Eq.  (4) 

suggests that if numerical data consisting of both tumor volume (assessed through imaging) and 

cell  density  (biopsies)  are  available,  it  would  be  a  straight-forward  exercise  to  estimate  the 

asymptotic mass of the tumor

ρ/vM
∞≈
∞

, where 

∞ρ  <  Maxρ  in equilibrium. Aside from such 

predictive purposes, our findings help to understand better some current therapeutic approaches 

and  challenges.  For  example,  anti-angiogenesis  therapy  which  is  geared  towards  limiting  the 

tumor’s  blood  supply  would  indeed  result  in  a  very  desirable  reduction  of  the  tumor  mass  m. 

This is consistent with the experimental findings [7-10] showing that antiangiogenic therapy can 

effectively slow down or even inhibit tumor growth. Nonetheless, although a reduction in m vis-

à-vis antiangiogenic treatment would also lead to a reduction in ρ (unless it is accompanied by a 

comparable reduction in volume) and thus possibly reduce invasion temporarily, it however may 

 

11

Thomas S. Deisboeck et al. “Indications for a Quantitative Link between Tumor Growth and Invasion” 

facilitate  rapid  volumetric  recurrence  of  the  tumor  as  soon  as  the  treatment  stops.  In  contrast, 

reducing both m and v through surgical intervention does not (necessarily) lead to a reduction in 

ρ. It follows that, in case there is residual tumor left behind, cell invasion continues from this site 

and may contribute to overall treatment failure.   

In summary, our model shows that (1) solid tumor growth and cell invasion are linked, 

not  only  qualitatively  but  also  quantitatively  as  indicated  by  Eq.  (4),  thereby  confirming  the 

concept  presented  in  [1],  that  (2)  the  onset  of  invasion  marks  the  time  point  when  the  tumor’s 

cell  density  exceeds  the  compaction  maximum,  and  that  (3)  cell  invasion,  reduction  of 

mechanical  confinement  and  angiogenesis  act  synergistically  in  order  to  raise  the  actual  tumor 

mass m towards the level predicted by the universal growth curve of West et al. [4] as well of the 

more general Delsanto et al.’s [3] version with a generic power-law exponent.

Abstract

We report the investigation of the 3s ‹

 2p transition in the BAr2 cluster.  In a

supersonic expansion of B atoms entrained in Ar, at high beam source backing pressures

we observe several features in the fluorescence excitation spectrum which cannot be

assigned to the BAr diatom.  Using BAr(X, B) potential energy curves which reproduce

our experimental observations on this molecule and an Ar–Ar interaction potential, we

employ a pairwise additive model, along with variational and diffusion Monte-Carlo

treatments of the nuclear motion, to determine the lowest vibrational state of the BAr2
cluster.  A subsequent simulation of the fluorescence excitation spectrum reproduces nearly

quantitatively the strongest feature in our experimental spectrum not assignable to BAr.
Because of the barrier in the BAr(B2S +) potential energy curve, the 3s ‹

 2p transition in

the BAr2 is predicted to have an asymmetric profile, as is found experimentally.

I.  INTRODUCTION

There has been considerable interest in non-bonding interactions between metal and

rare gas atoms.  In part, this interest stems from a desire to understand the behavior of light
metal atoms in cryogenic media, such as solid rare gas and hydrogen matrices.1  Such

systems offer the potential for the storage of energy for technological applications.

Spectroscopic investigations of electronic transitions in diatomic metal – rare gas van der

Waals complexes have provided considerable information on such interactions in both
ground and electronically excited states.2  The availability of these diatomic potential energy

curves is essential for understanding the behavior of metal atoms in larger clusters and

cryogenic matrices.

We have been interested for some time in the non-bonding interactions of the boron

atom with rare gases and the hydrogen molecule.3-14  There are two B atomic transitions
with wavelengths > 200 nm:  2s23s 2S ‹
2s22p 2P at 208.9 nm.15  With laser fluorescence excitation detection, we have observed

 2s22p 2P at 249.8 nm and 2s2p2 2D ‹

diatomic electronic transitions correlating with both of these transitions in the BNe and BAr
complexes.  The lowest electronic transition, B2S + – X2P
, whose upper and lower states
correlate with the B atomic 2s23s 2S and 2s22p 2P states, respectively, has a dramatically

different spectrum for these two species.  For BNe, this transition appears as a broad,
unstructured feature to the blue of the 2s23s 2S ‹

 2s22p 2P atomic transition.5  With the

help of electronic structure calculations, this spectrum was simulated, and the unstructured

nature of the transition was shown to be due to the purely repulsive nature of the
BNe(B2S +) potential energy curve.5  The spectrum of the BAr B2S + – X2P

 transition

displays rotationally resolved bands in the red portion of the spectrum and several
unresolved features to the blue.  The potential energy curve for the BAr(B2S +) possesses a
deep inner well [D0' »
 1010 cm–1] and a shallow outer well, with an intervening barrier.3
The features in the blue portion of the spectrum are not rotationally resolved because of the

large tunneling rate through and over this barrier.

There has been considerable interest in the effect of solvation on electronic
transitions of a chromophore.16, 17  Electronic absorption spectra of boron atoms trapped in
argon and hydrogen matrices have been reported.1, 18, 19  One surprising observation from

these studies is that the electronic absorptions appear only at wavelengths < 220 nm,
considerably shorter in wavelength than that of the first transition in atomic B, 2s23s 2S ‹

2s22p 2P at 249.8 nm.  It is possible that this gas-phase transition is shifted considerably
to the blue,18 or so broadened by interaction with the matrix as to be undetectably weak and
blended into the baseline absorption.  Boatz and Fajardo20 have carried out classical Monte
Carlo simulations of the B 3s ‹

 2p absorption in a cluster of argon atoms and conclude

that the transition should remain sharp in such an environment.

One approach to the understanding of the spectrum of a chromophore in a matrix is

to study the transition in small clusters.  Several groups have studied the Hg 6s6p 3P1 ‹
6s2 1S transition in small HgArn clusters.21-23  Visticot et al. have studied the Ba 6s6p 1P

 6s2 1S transition for Ba atoms attached to large Arn clusters.24  Whetten and co-

workers25 have probed the evolution of the Al 4s ‹
function of the size n.  More recently, Okumura and co-workers26 have carried out similar
experiments on the 3d ‹
electronic transitions of Na atoms and dimers attached to liquid helium clusters.27

Theoretical investigations of the absorption spectrum of alkali metal atoms in noble
gas solids and/or clusters have been reported by Singer and co-workers,28 and Boatz and
Fajardo.29  Cheng and Whaley have carried out a similar investigation involving Li atoms
in p-H2 clusters.30  Zúñiga et al. have reported the theoretical study, of the absorption
spectrum of Hg(3P1  ‹
state of the chromophore atom is spherically symmetric (an S electronic state).  The

 1S0) in the HgAr2 cluster.31 In these systems the ground electronic

degeneracy of the P excited state of the chromophore is split by interactions with the cluster

ligands.  However, in the case of clusters containing B, it is the ground state which is

electronically degenerate.  Hence, the absorption spectra of B containing clusters is

homologous to that of halogen atoms trapped in noble gas cages, investigated recently by
Lawrence and Fajardo.32

In the present paper, we report a collaborative experimental and theoretical

investigation of the 3s ‹

 2p transition in the BAr2 cluster.  As we describe below, we have

observed at high beam source backing pressures several features in the fluorescence

excitation spectrum which cannot be assigned to the BAr diatom.  Using BAr(X, B)

potential energy curves which reproduce our experimental observations on this molecule

and an Ar–Ar interaction potential, we have used a pairwise additive model to simulate the

structure and electronic absorption of the BAr2 cluster.  Our approach parallels closely that
of Cheng and Whaley,30 in our use of variational33-35 and diffusion36, 37 Monte-Carlo

our experimental spectrum not assignable to BAr.  Because of the barrier in the BAr(B2S +)
potential energy curve, the 3s ‹

 2p transition in the BAr2 is expected to have an

asymmetric profile, as is found experimentally.

II.  EXPERIMENTAL

The apparatus with which the experimental spectra were obtained has been

described in detail previously.3, 5, 9, 10  A supersonic beam containing B atoms and its

weakly bound complexes with one or more Ar atoms was prepared in a pulsed free jet

expansion (0.2 mm diam orifice) of B2H6/Ar/He mixtures through 193 nm photolysis of
diborane at the nozzle orifice.  Fluorescence excitation spectra were recorded 1.2 cm
downstream of the nozzle with the frequency-doubled output (bandwidth 0.4 cm–1) of a
dye laser (Lambda Physik LPD3002E) in the wavelength region near the B atomic 2s23s 2S
 2s22p 2P transition at 249.8 nm.  Typical uv pulse energies were 10 m J in a 0.2 cm

diam beam.  Fluorescence depletion experiments were carried out by overlapping this
tunable laser beam with a second tunable laser beams, as described previously.10

The laser-induced fluorescence signal passed through a 1/4 m monochromator and

was detected with a photomultiplier (EMI 9813QB), whose output was directed to a gated

integrator and thence to a laboratory computer.  The monochromator helped to discriminate

the fluorescence signal from background light induced by the photolysis laser.  In addition,

the gain of the photomultiplier was switched off during the excimer laser pulse by zeroing

the voltage difference between the photocathode and first dynode.  A portion of the

fundamental output of the dye laser was directed through a solid-fused silica etalon (free
spectral range 1.18 cm–1) in order to provide wavenumber markers.  The B atomic
2s23s 2S – 2s22p 2P1/2,3/2 transitions15 were employed for absolute calibration.

We presented in a previous publication3 a laser fluorescence excitation spectrum of

the BAr B2S + – X2P 1/2 transition.  We present in Fig. 1 a similar spectrum taken with a
high Ar source backing pressure (9.1 atm).  Along with the strong B atomic lines, visible

in the spectrum are rotationally resolved BAr (v',0) B – X bands [v' = 6 and 7], as well as

unresolved transitions to higher vibrational levels [v' = 8 and 9] which lie near or slightly
above the barrier in the BAr(B2S +) potential energy curve.

4

‹
Also present in the spectrum of Fig. 1 is an additional feature to the blue of the BAr

transitions.  The intensity of this feature (labeled “BAr2”), relative to the intensities of the
BAr bands, was found to be significantly reduced in spectra taken with lower source Ar

backing pressures or Ar mole fractions.

We also investigated the molecular carrier of this feature in fluorescence
depletion10, 38, 39 (FD) experiments.  This technique is a folded variant of optical-optical

double resonance spectroscopy, in which two lasers access the same lower level.  This

allows the observation of transitions by monitoring the effect of the so-called depletion

laser on the fluorescence induced by the probe laser.  FD spectroscopy has been employed
to detect transitions to non-fluorescing excited states10, 39, 40 and can also be utilized to
detect transitions in specific molecular species.10, 11, 40  We verified that the feature labeled

“BAr2” in Fig. 1 was not due to BAr through FD experiments.  Specifically, we scanned
the spectral region shown in Fig. 1 with the probe laser set to excite the BAr D – X (0,0)
band.  [The BAr(D2P

) state correlates with the excited valence B(2s2p2 2D) + Ar

asymptote, and the analysis of the D – X transition will be presented in forthcoming
publications.11, 40]  Depletion was observed only on transitions previously identified as
belonging to BAr,3 and not on the “BAr2” feature.

Thus, the molecular carrier of this spectral transition is not the diatomic BAr

complex, but a higher BArn cluster.  In Sec. V, we present a simulated spectrum for the 3s
 2p transition in BAr2.  This simulation reproduces very well the shape and wavenumber
range of this experimentally observed feature.  In additional FD experiments, we observed
the absorption spectrum of the BAr2 complex in the region of the B atomic 2s2p2 2D ‹
2s22p 2P transition.  The interpretation of this spectrum and comparison with a theoretical

simulation will be presented in a future publication.

III.  BAr COMPLEX

Since our description of the ternary BAr2 complex will be based on a pairwise

additive model, we first have refined somewhat our description of the ground (X2P
and the first bound excited state (B2S +) of the binary BAr complex.3  Our earlier theoretical
estimate3 of the dissociation energy for the X2P
than a recent experimental estimate by Yang and Dagdigian40 (D0" = 102.4 –
Since the BAr well results from dispersion interactions, the discrepancy between the

 state (D0" = 75.1 cm–1) is ~ 33 % less
 0.3 cm–1).

theoretical and experimental estimates of the well depth is a manifestation of the incomplete

recovery of the electronic correlation energy in the theoretical calculations, due to the finite

size of the one-electron basis used, and the exclusion of higher order (triple, quadruple, ...)

excitations out of the reference space.

In earlier investigations of the BNe and C2H2Ar complexes,5, 41 we suggested that
this shortcoming of the theoretical calculations could be easily corrected by a simple scaling
of the correlation energy.  This had already been proposed by Brown and Truhlar42 and
Sölter et al.43 in calculations on chemically bonded systems.  Here we define the

correlation energy as the difference between the multi-reference, averaged coupled-pair

(MR-ACPF) energy and the energy expectation value of the CASSCF reference function
from our earlier ab initio calculations on BAr(X2P
the scaled BAr(X2P

(J = 1/2) the problem decouples further, into two sets of 2 states, and one state which is
uncoupled.44  The two sets of 2 ·

 2 potential matrices are identical and are given by Eq.

(A5) in Appendix A.  The individual elements of this matrix involve the potential energy
curves for the X2P
respectively, as well as the spin-orbit constant of the B atom in the ground (2s22p 2P)

 and A2S + states of BAr,3 which we denote VP (R) and VS (R),

electronic) states of BAr correspond to the bound-state solutions of Eq. (3).

The description can be simplified by the adiabatic approximation, in which the

vibronic states correspond to solutions of the following uncoupled equation, which

corresponds to motion governed by a single potential energy curve,

With a choice of scaling factor s = 1.19, the calculated dissociation energy and

rotational constants for BAr(X2P
extremely well with the experimental estimates:3, 40  102.4 –

), 106.1 cm–1 and 0.149 cm–1, respectively, agree

 0.3 cm–1 and 0.150 cm–1.

The exact energy, given by solution of Eq. (3), differs from the adiabatic estimate by
< 0.02 cm–1, which indicates that nonadiabatic effects are very small indeed.  Lowering

the scaling factor slightly has the effect of decreasing the error in the calculated dissociation

energy, but increasing the error in the calculated value of the rotational constant.  An

identical scaling factor (s = 1.19) was used to define the potential energy curve for the
mainly repulsive BAr(A2S +) state, which also correlates with the ground atomic asymptote
B(2s22p 2P) + Ar.  Table I gives values for VP (R) and VS (R), for a scaling factor of 1.19.

The BAr(B2S +) state correlates with the B(2s23s 2S) + Ar asymptote.  To define

the potential energy curve for this state, which we designate V3s(R), we use the

the B atomic transition wavenumber [hn  = 40039.7 cm–1 (Ref. 15)], the RKR potential
could be fixed relative to the energy of the B(2s23s 2S) + Ar asymptote.  The height,

) dissociation

width, and general shape of the barrier were then adjusted so that the calculated positions

and widths of the metastable states trapped by this barrier (v' = 7 – 9) agreed well with the

experimental estimates.  Table II gives values for the resulting V3s(R) potential energy
1/2, 3/2, A2S +, and B2S +
curve.  Figure 2 displays the potential energy curves of the X2P
states of BAr.  The height of the barrier in the B state potential energy curve is 108.0 cm–1,
at R = 7.178 bohr.  The dissociation energy for V3s(R) is D0 = 1000.5 cm–1.

The calculated positions and rotational constants for the bound vibrational states of

the 10BAr(B2S +) and 11BAr(B2S +) isotopomers, and the positions and widths of the
predissociating states (determined as described in Ref. 3) are compared in Table III with the
experimental estimates3, 40 of these quantities.  As can be seen, the agreement is excellent.
The position of the BAr(B2S +) bound and predissociating states are also shown in Fig. 2.

IV.  BAr2 COMPLEX:  STRUCTURE

We construct the potential for the ternary BAr2 complex using a pairwise additive
model.  As will be discussed below, we shall follow an adiabatic approach, involving a

sum of pairwise potential matrices, to account for the orientational property of the singly

filled 2p orbital of the B atom.  Our treatment is equivalent to that introduced by Balling and
Wright45 to simulate the absorption spectra of alkali atoms in noble gas matrices.  This

treatment of the interaction between an atom in a P electronic state with an ensemble of
spherical perturbers has been used subsequently by Boatz and Fajardo,29 Lawrence and
Apkarian,32 Zúñiga et al.,31 and Cheng and Whaley.30  We assume, without loss of

generality, that the B atom is fixed at the origin of the coordinate system.  As discussed in

the preceding section and in Appendix A, the interaction of an Ar atom with the B atom can
be expressed by a 6 ·
B(2s22p 2P) atom as a basis.  If the Ar atom is located at a distance R along the z-axis, this

 6 matrix using the uncoupled (or coupled) spin-orbit states of the

matrix, designated V(R) in Appendix A, can be additionally block diagonalized.

8

If the Ar atom is arbitrarily positioned in space, at polar coordinates (R, q , f ), the

matrix describing its electrostatic interaction with the B atom is given by

V(R, q , f ) ”

 D(f , q , 0) V(R) DT(f , q , 0)  ,

(6)

where D(f , q , 0) is the matrix, in the basis of the spin-orbit states of the B atom, of the
rotation specified by the Euler angles {f , q , 0}.  The matrix V(R) is the matrix of the
interaction potential not including the spin-orbit interaction.  As described in more detail in
Appendix A, V(R, q , f ) is the 6 ·
electrostatic interaction of an Ar atom at polar coordinates (R, q , f ) with a B atom sitting at

 6 matrix, in an uncoupled Cartesian basis, for the

the origin with 2p orbital oriented along the x, y, or z axes.

In the adiabatic approximation, which we have seen was of high accuracy for the

1, f

1, R2, q

binary BAr complex, the BAr2 complex is characterized by a single potential energy
surface, Vad(R1, q

(7)

which describes the electrostatic and spin-orbit interactions in the BAr2 system.  In Eq. (7),
a is the matrix of the spin-orbit operator in the same uncoupled Cartesian basis (see
Appendix A).  Also, VAr2(R12) is the scalar interaction potential between two Ar atoms
separated by a distance R12.  We use the Ar2 potential of Aziz and Chen,46 with
Re = 7.1053 bohr, De = 97.81 cm–1, and D0 = 83.1 cm–1.

Since the potential energy surface is taken as pairwise additive, the minimum

energy of the BAr2 cluster is attained in an isosceles triangular configuration, with R1 = R2
and R12 equal to the equilibrium internuclear separation in the Ar2 cluster.  Since three
atoms define a plane, both Ar atoms can be situated in a plane perpendicular to the B 2p

orbital, which is the optimal geometry.  Thus we anticipate, and find, that the BAr distance

in the BAr2 cluster is identical to the equilibrium internuclear separation in the binary BAr
cluster, 6.6889 bohr.  The energy of the BAr2 cluster at its equilibrium geometry is –356.9
cm–1.

To choose these points we use the standard Metropolis algorithm, as follows.  An

ensemble of N sets of Cartesian coordinates (qi) for all three particles is chosen using a
uniform random number generator over a range –

 dq centered on the equilibrium position

of each particle.  The local energy is then evaluated.  In this procedure, the standard three-
point finite-difference approximation48 was used to evaluate the Laplacian.  Each set of

Cartesian coordinates is then changed by addition of a random increment chosen from a
uniform random distribution centered at zero and spanning the range –

 d .  If the probability

P(q) is larger for the randomly altered set of coordinates, the old set is replaced by the

randomly altered set.  If the probability is smaller for the randomly altered set of

coordinates, then the randomly altered set is retained only if the ratio of the probability at

the new set of coordinates divided by the probability at the old set of coordinates is greater

than a uniform random number chosen on the interval {0,1}.  The local energy is then re-

evaluated and the whole procedure iterated.

The numerical (exact) wavefunctions for the lowest vibrational states of the BAr(X)

and Ar2 complexes can be approximated extremely well (S > 0.9999) by Morse functions.
The Morse parameters which define the best fit to the numerical (exact) wavefunctions are

given in Table IV.  Since a Morse function does so well in approximating the vibrational

wavefunctions of the embedded binary complexes, a good choice for a variational

approximation to the wavefunction of the vibrational ground state of the ternary B(2p)Ar2
complex will be a product of three Morse functions, namely

For BAr2 we choose, in Eqs. (16) and (17), the Morse parameters for the
embedded binary complexes, from Table IV.  The three parameters which control the VMC
integration, N, dq, and d , are adjusted empirically so that (a) this convergence is rapid, (b)

the residual statistical fluctuation is within an acceptable limit of uncertainty in the calculated

energy, and (c) the rate of acceptance of the randomly altered coordinates is ~ 50 %.  We
have chosen dq = 4 and d  = 3/8 (both in bohr).  Figure 3 illustrates the convergence of the

variational energy [Eq. (12)] as the number of iterations increases, using both 100 and 500

integration points N, and dq = 4 and 5.  We observe in Fig. 3 that the magnitude of the
statistical fluctuations in the energy, once convergence has been reached, vary as ~ N–1/2,

as expected.  As an improved estimate of the energy, we average the calculated energy of
five independent runs with N = 500 and dq = 4, obtaining E = – 295.12 –

 0.21 cm–1.

In an attempt to improve the variational energy, we implemented a Monte-Carlo
based variation49 of the 6 parameters which define the trial wavefunction for the BAr2
cluster (Table IV).  The nth parameter, selected randomly, was allowed to vary by an
amount, also selected randomly from a uniform distribution in the range –

 10% of the

original value of the parameter.  The variational energy for the new set of parameters is

evaluated using the combined set of integration points corresponding to the last 10

Metropolis sampling iterations with the original set of parameters.  Since the integration

points are not readjusted (resampled) for the new set of parameters, this evaluation of the
variational energy is called “reweighting.”34

Repeated applications of this Monte-Carlo variation of the parameters used to define

the trial wavefunction never yielded an energy which was lower, to within statistical error,

than the calculated energy for the product of the Morse functions for the embedded binary
complexes, defined by the parameters shown in Table IV.  This energy (–295.12 –
0.21 cm–1) is the VMC approximation to the energy of the vibrational ground state of the

B(2p)Ar2 cluster.

The calculated dissociation energies of the binary B(2p)Ar and Ar2 clusters are (see

Sec. III) D0 = 106.1 cm–1 and 83.1 cm–1, respectively.  Thus, as we might have
anticipated, the calculated VMC energy of the vibrational ground state of B(2p)Ar2 is, to
within statistical error, equal to the sum of the dissociation energies of the three bonds.

B.  Diffusion Monte-Carlo method

The Diffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC) method36, 37 uses the fact that the time-

dependent Schrödinger equation may be converted into a diffusion equation by making a

transformation to imaginary time. The oscillatory solutions of the time-dependent

Schrödinger equation are thereby mapped onto a set of relaxation processes of the form

n  and En are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, respectively, of the Hamiltonian in
question (which is taken to be time independent) and the zero of energy has been redefined

as Er.  If this “reference energy” is the ground state energy, then all the components of
Eq. (18) will decay to zero except for the ground state eigenfunction.

The DMC method is implemented using an unguided random walk.  An ensemble

of N0 sets of Cartesian coordinates (qi) for all three particles is chosen.  At each time step,
all members of this ensemble, designated “replicas”, are displaced in space, with the
displacement of the kth Cartesian coordinate of the ith replica chosen randomly from a
normal distribution with standard deviation  s
product of the (imaginary) time step and the diffusion coefficient36

Initially equal weights are assigned to each replica.  In the “continuous weighting”

If the weight of any replica drops below a certain value (here taken to be 1/N), then that

replica is eliminated from the ensemble. A replacement is created by duplicating the replica

with the highest weight, halving the weights of both the duplicate and the original, and

adding the weight of the eliminated replica to the duplicate. In this way the total number of

replicas remains constant.

Following the readjustment of the weights, the reference energy, Er, is updated.

We use the simple algorithm proposed by Anderson36

The value of a in Eq. (23) depends on the size of the time step:

(25)

with D

translational motion of the cluster is subtracted at the end of each displacement by

repositioning the center-of-mass of each cluster (replica) at the origin.

The DMC method provides two estimates for the ground state energy, namely the

reference energy, Er, and the mean potential energy,  V( )t
here, the ground state energy was taken to be the time average of  V( )t

.  For the calculations reported

 over the last 10%

of the total propagation time.  To construct a histogram approximation to the ground state

wavefunction, the three interatomic distances and the replica weights were summed over

the last 10% of the total propagation time.

Both the ground state energy and probability density can be calculated more

efficiently by importance sampling.37, 50-52  We define a new function  f

The first term on the right hand side of Eq. (26) represents the diffusion of the replicas in

where the potential in Eq. (22) is replaced by the local energy of the trial function.  If this

latter is identical to the ground state wavefunction, then the last term on the right hand side

of Eq. (26) will vanish when Er = E0.  Further, the reference energy for each replica is
defined initially as the energy of the cluster and Er is still adjusted according to Eq. (23)
which makes use of the mean potential energy,  V( )t

, .

In our implementation of importance sampling, the trial wavefunction was taken to

be the product of Morse functions used in the VMC calculations (discussed in the preceding

sub-section and defined by the parameters in Table IV).  We determine the DMC

approximation to the ground state energy as before, averaging the mean potential energy

over the last 10% of the time steps.  However, it is the function f which is now represented
by the replica weights.  Hence, we construct   F
exactly as in the determination of  F

 without the use of importance sampling, the

As discussed above, the ground-state vibrational wavefunctions for both the

B(2p)Ar and B(2p)Ar2 complexes may be accurately approximated by Morse functions.
Thus, for the DMC calculations reported here, the importance sampling technique was

implemented taking the wavefunction given in Eq. (14) as the trial wavefunction. Each

replica was initially defined as having the equilibrium geometry, with a small random

displacement from a normal distribution with the standard deviation defined in Eq. (19).

An ensemble of 2000 replicas was propagated for a total time of 40000 atomic time units,

using a time step of 0.25 a.u.

The lower panel of Fig. 3 compares the calculated values of the reference energy as

a function of imaginary time, for a representative DMC run, with and without importance

sampling.  As can be seen, the use of importance sampling dramatically improves the

convergence.  The final energy from the DMC + importance sampling calculation is
– 295.9 –

 0.1 cm–1.  This is ~ 0.8 cm–1 lower than the VMC value – a slight improvement.

V.  BAr2 COMPLEX:  SPECTRUM

As can be seen from Fig. 2, electronic excitation of the B atom in the BAr2
complex, at its equilibrium geometry, will lead to formation of the B(3s)Ar2 complex with
the B(3s) atom located just slightly inside the top of the barrier in the B(3s)Ar potential

energy curve.  The excited state, so produced, will, however, not be stable with respect to

elimination of an Ar atom since its energy is greater than that of the B(3s)Ar + Ar
asymptote.  Because the B(3s)Ar well depth is so deep (D0 = 1000.5 cm–1), decreasing
the length of one of the BAr bonds will provide more than enough energy to stretch the

second BAr bond over the barrier and also break the Ar–Ar bond.  Thus electronic
excitation of the BAr2 complex will correspond to a free ‹

 bound photodissociation.

To simulate the spectrum, we use the semiclassical expression,30, 53

where F

g and V3s(q) are the wavefunction and potential energy, respectively, of the
vibrational ground state of the B(2p)Ar2 complex and V3s(q) is the potential energy of the
B(3s)Ar2 complex.  Since B(3s) is electronically non-degenerate, within a pairwise additive
approximation we represent V3s(q) – the PES for the B(3s)Ar2 complex – as a sum of two
B(3s)Ar potentials defined in Sec. III and the Ar2 potential of Aziz and co-workers.46
Since we are using a pairwise additive description of both the ground and excited states and

since the Ar2 interaction appears as a scalar term in the description of the ground state [see
Eq. (7)], the Ar–Ar potential energy cancels inside the delta function in Eq. (28).

In Eq. (28), we have ignored the dependence of the 3s ‹

 2p electronic transition
moment on the B–Ar separations.  We previously found4 that the BAr B – X and B – A

transition moments remained equal to their asymptotic, atomic values and were independent

of the internuclear separation R, except for very small R.

Consistent with our Monte-Carlo treatment, we approximate the integral in Eq. (18)

a combined total of 2000 integration points.  For the importance sampled DMC simulation

2000 replicas were propagated for 40 000 steps in imaginary time.  To simulate the spectra,

while reducing any effect of correlation between individual time step, we accumulated the

coordinates of each replica and their weights at steps 37 000, 38 000, 39 000, and 40 000;

for a total of 8000 points. The kinetic energy correction for the DMC spectral simulation
[Eq. (31)] was evaluated using the Morse product function as F

g(q).

Figure 5 also presents the experimental spectra associated with the BAr2 complex.

As discussed in the experimental section, at energies below ~ 290 cm–1 [relative to the

B(3s)+Ar+Ar asymptote], the feature associated with BAr2 is obscured by the wing of the
BAr (B2S +, v' = 9) ‹ 

1/2, v" = 0) transition.  This transition occurs at

relative to the B 3s 2S ‹

by predissociation.

The agreement with experiment is excellent.  We observe that the kinetic energy

correction, as defined by Eqs. (30) and (31), shifts the peak of the calculated spectrum

slightly to lower energy.  The asymmetry in the line shape, which is clearly present in both

the DMC and VMC simulations, is a consequence of the shape of the potential energy

V.  DISCUSSION

As can be seen in Fig. 5, the VMC and importance-sampled DMC calculations

predict an excitation spectrum for the 3s ‹

 2p transition of the BAr2 complex that agrees

19

F
F
(cid:242)
(cid:242)
well, both in location, width, and asymmetry, with the experimentally observed spectrum.

The agreement is somewhat better with the VMC calculation, which indicates that this latter

approach likely provides a better description of the ground state wavefunction and/or a

better prescription for the evaluation of the semi-classical integral for the spectral intensity

[ Eq. (29) ].  The good agreement between the predicted and observed spectra is further
confirmation that this feature does indeed correspond to the B(3s ‹ 2p) excitation within the

BAr2 complex.

Introduction of the kinetic energy correction of Eq. (30) leads to a closer match

between the VMC simulation and the experimental spectrum.  The agreement is, we feel,

excellent.  The residual differences could reflect remaining errors in the semiclassical

approximation to the absorption lineshape.

Another origin for the difference between the predicted (VMC) and experimental

spectra would be inaccuracies in the two-body potentials.  In particular, we see from
Figs. 2 and 4 that a vertical B(3s ‹ 2p) transition within the BAr2 complex will probe the
B(3s)Ar potential in the region of the barrier, where it is less well determined

spectroscopically.

A third origin of the difference between the predicted (VMC) and experimental

spectra is errors resulting from use of the pairwise construction of the matrix of the

electronic Hamiltonian and the use of the lowest root of this Hamiltonian to define the

adiabatic potential energy surface.  As discussed in Sec. III, we anticipate on the basis of

our calculations on B(2p)Ar, that nonadiabatic effects will be negligibly small for the

ternary complex.

Notwithstanding the slight residual difference between the calculated and

experimental 3s ‹

 2p absorption spectrum of the BAr complex, we are extremely pleased

by the overall good agreement.  This article shows the degree to which a sophisticated

theoretical investigation can enhance the value and understanding of experiment.  Indeed,

without comparison of the experimental results with such theoretical calculations,

assignment of the observed feature in our experimental spectrum to the BAr2 complex
would have been to make convincingly.

Our success in applying Monte-Carlo methods, particularly the VMC method, to the

study of complexes involving the open-shell B atom, encourages the study of larger

clusters.  Hopefully, these calculations will guide the way for experimental investigation of

20

such clusters and provide an assignment of the 3s ‹

 2p transition for boron atoms

embedded in bulk matrices.

APPENDIX A:  MATRIX OF THE INTERACTION POTENTIAL

Consider the interaction between an atom in a 2P electronic state and a closed-shell

atom which lies along the z-axis.  The atom may be described in a coupled (| l s j m >) or
uncoupled (| l ml s ms >) basis.55  In matrix notation the transformation between these two
representations can be written

{l s j m} = C {l ml s ms}  ,

(A1)

where C is a 6 ·

 6 matrix of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.55  In the coupled basis the spin-

orbit operator is diagonal, with matrix elements

By contrast, the electrostatic interaction is diagonal in the uncoupled basis, with matrix

elements given by

< l ml s ms | V | l ml' s ms' > = d

msms' d

ml ml' [ d

ml,0 VS (R) + d  | ml

 |,1 VP (R) ]  ,

(A3)

where VS (R) and VP (R) are the Hund’s case (a) B(2s22p)Ar electrostatic potentials for an

orientation in which the Ar atom approaches, respectively, colinearly or perpendicularly to

the singly-filled 2p orbital.

21

It will also be convenient to use an uncoupled, Cartesian basis in which the | l ml >
states are replaced by | l ql > states, where ql = x, y, or z and specifies the orientation of the
real (Cartesian) B 2p orbitals.  Keeping a notation similar to that used in Sec. III, in this
uncoupled, Cartesian basis we designate the full 6 ·

Matrix (A5) can be further factored into a 2 ·

 2 block and a single state, and since no

complex arithmetic is involved, the latter representation is obviously preferable for dimer
complexes involving a single noble gas atom.  The upper-left  2 ·  2 block of matrix (A5) is
identical to the  ˜V (R) matrix of Eq. (3) for the BAr complex with total angular momentum
J = 1/2.44  It is the eigenvalues of matrix (A5) which are shown in the lower panel of

Fig. 2.

Now, suppose that instead of lying along the z axis, the noble gas atom is

arbitrarily positioned, with the orientation of R defined by the polar and azimuthal angles
(q , f ) .  The matrix of the electrostatic interaction V(R) is transformed from the electrostatic
components in Eq. (A4) by a 6 ·
identical 3 ·  3 blocks, each of which is the usual matrix of the rotation W
on the Cartesian unit vectors  ˆx ,  ˆy  and  ˆz ,55 namely

FIG 1.  Survey laser fluorescence excitation scan, taken with 9.1 atm source backing

marked are the B atomic 2s23s 2S – 2s22p 2P1/2,3/2 lines and the feature at high energy
arising from the 3s ‹

 2p transition in the ternary BAr2 complex.    The fluorescence signal

 (v',0) bands for the 11,10BAr isotopomers.  Also

has not been corrected for the small wavelength variation of the laser pulse energy.  The

atomic B and BAr features are identical to those shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. 3.  The abscissa
 2P1/2) transition [hn  = 40039.7 cm–1 (Ref.
is the shift (in cm–1) relative to the B(2S ‹

15)].

FIG 2.  Potential energy curves for the BAr X2P 1/2, A2S +, and B2S + states.  The X and A

state curves correspond to our earlier ab initio calculations (Ref. 3) modified by the scaled

correlation energy adjustment described in Sec. III with a scaling factor of s = 1.19.  The B

state curve is the RKR curve from Ref. 3 with the position of the vibrational energy levels

adjusted with the help of our recent determination of the ground dissociation energy, as

described in the text.  For all states, the asymptotes refer to the separated atom limits [B(2p,

3s) + Ar]. The position, height, and shape of the barrier (shown in more detail in the inset)

have been adjusted to give reasonable agreement (see Table III) with the experimental

estimates of the positions and widths of the predissociating v' = 8 and 9 levels.  In the

inset, the upper and lower lines, for each value of v, indicate the position and outer turning
point of the vibrational levels for 10BAr and 11BAr, respectively.  In the case of v' = 9, the

resonance associated with the lighter isotope is too broad to be either seen in the

experimental spectrum or distinguished in the theoretical simulation of the spectrum.

FIG 3.  (Upper panel) Comparison of the variational energy [Eq. (12)] of the lowest

vibrational state of the BAr2 complex, calculated using the variational Monte-Carlo method
within the electronically adiabatic approximation.  The three traces correspond to N = {100,

500, 500} integration points and initial widths of dq = {4, 4, 5}, respectively.  For clarity,

open and filled circles are used to mark the traces corresponding to the second and third

sets of parameters.  The root-mean-square energies and standard deviations for the three

sets of parameters, determined using the calculated energies from iterations 61 – 80, are (in

32

cm–1), Erms = {–295.08, –294.91, –295.00} and s  = { 0.51, 0.22, 0.21}.  The dashed
horizontal line corresponds to an energy of –295.1 cm–1.  (Lower panel) Comparison of

the DMC reference energy as a function of imaginary time for the lowest vibrational state of

the BAr2 complex.  An ensemble of 2000 replicas was used with a time step of 0.25 a.u.
The solid line and open circles indicate the energies determined without and with,

respectively, importance sampling based on the variational approximation of Eq. (14)

discussed in Sec. IVA.  The dashed horizontal line corresponds to an energy of
–295.9 cm–1.

FIG 4.  Potential energy surface for the B(3s)Ar2 complex as a function of the two BAr
distances.  The ArBAr angle is 64.16˚, corresponding to the angle at the minimum in the
B(2p)Ar2 cluster.  All energies are in cm–1, with respect to B(3s)+Ar+Ar.  For clarity, the
zero energy contours are marked with heavy lines.  The dashed contours represent the

square of the lowest vibrational wavefunction of the B(2p)Ar2 complex.

FIG 5.  Comparison of the predicted laser excited fluorescence spectrum (top and middle

panel) of the BAr2 complex with the experimental observations (lower panel).  The
abscissa is the shift (in cm–1) relative to the B(2S ‹

 2P1/2) transition [hn  = 40039.7 cm–1

(Ref. 15)].  The upper panels presents spectral simulations carried out with points and

weights resulting from application of the DMC method (upper panel) and VMC method

(middle panel).  The solid and dashed spectra correspond, respectively to application of the

semiclassical expression with [Eq. (30)] and without [Eq. (28)] correction for the kinetic

energy of the B atom.  The lower panel (experimental spectrum) is an enlargement of the

BAr2 feature shown in Fig. 1.  As indicated by the dashed curve in the lower panel, and
seen more clearly in Fig. 1, at energies less than ~ 290 cm–1, this feature is obscured by the
wing of the BAr (B2S +, v' = 9) ‹ 
230 cm–1 and substantially broadened by predissociation.

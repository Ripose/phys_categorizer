Abstract

The  status  of  VEPP-2M  collider  is  presented.  Im-
plementation  of  Round  Colliding  Beams  (RCB)  con-
cept in the new collider VEPP-2000 is outlined, poten-
tial  advantages  of  RCB  over  the  flat  colliding  beams
are discussed. The main design parameters and features
of this VEPP-2000 collider are reported.

1 MOTIVATIONS
Since the end of 1992 the  e e+ −  collider  VEPP-2M
in  Novosibirsk  has  been  successfully  running  in  the
c.m. energy range from threshold of hadron production
up to 1.4 GeV. Since 1984 VEPP-2M is operating with
the  five  poles  superconducting  wiggler  with  the  maxi-
,  which  increases  the  beam  emit-
mum  field 
tance  by  a  factor  of  3.  The  integrated  luminosity  of
about  50  pb 1−   was  collected  with  two  modern  detec-
tors SND[1] and CMD-2[2] allowing precise measure-
ments of most of the hadronic channels of  e e+ −
 anni-
hilation. Together with 24 pb 1−
 collected at VEPP-2M
in  the  previous  generation  of  experiments  in  1974–
1987, this integrated luminosity is more than one order
of magnitude higher than about 6 pb 1−
 accumulated by
various  experimental  groups  in  Frascati  and  Orsay  in
the c.m. energy range from 1.4 to 2 GeV. Thus, there is
a  serious  energy  gap  between  the  maximum  energy
attainable  at  VEPP-2M  and  2  GeV  in  which  existing
data on  e e+ −
 annihilation into hadrons are rather im-
precise. Accurate measurements of hadronic cross sec-
tions in this  energy range are crucial for better under-
standing of many phenomena in high energy physics. 

A recent decision to upgrade the VEPP-2M complex
by  replacing  the  existing  collider  with  a  new  one,  in
order  to  improve  the  luminosity  and  at  the  same  time
increase  the  maximum  attainable  energy  up  to  2  GeV,
will  significantly  broaden  the  potential  of  experiments
performed  at  the  collider.  Following  modern  modern
trends, the new project was named VEPP-2000.

2 LUMINOSITY OF COLLIDERS AND
ROUND COLLIDING BEAMS
CONCEPT
The  basic  parameter  of  a  collider  is  its  luminosity  L
which in the case of short bunches is determined by the
formula:

on the VEPP-2M collider[3].

Aiming  at  a  very  high  luminosity  due  to  raising  the
ξ  limits  in  the  Novosibirsk  Φ -Factory  project[4,  5],
colliding  beams  with  round  transverse  cross-sections
were  proposed  (just  “round  beams”  in  what  follows).
During the last decade at BINP, this approach evolved
into the concept of Round Colliding Beams (RCB)[6].

In  the  RCB  case,  the  luminosity  formula  has  the

form:

and  the  space  charge  parameters  are  now  the  same  in
the  two  directions,  so  the  horizontal  parameter  can  be
strongly enhanced.

The  evident  advantage  of  round  colliding  beams  is
that with the fixed particle density, the tune shift  from
the opposite bunch becomes twice as small as the tune
shift  in  the  case  of  flat  colliding  beams.  Besides,  the
linear  beam-beam  tune-shift  in  the  round  beams  be-
comes  independent  of  the  longitudinal  position  in  the
bunch,  thereby  weakening  the  action  of  synchro-
betatron resonances.

The main feature of the RCB is rotational symmetry
of  the  kick  from  the  round  opposite  beam;  comple-
mented  with  the  X Z−   symmetry  of  the  betatron
transfer  matrix  between  the  collisions,  it  results  in  an
additional  integral  of  motion 
  i.e.  the
longitudinal  component  of  particle’s  angular  momen-
tum is conserved. Thus, the transverse motion becomes
equivalent to a one-dimensional (1D) motion. Resulting
elimination  of  all  betatron  coupling  resonances  is  of
crucial importance, since they are believed to cause the
beam lifetime degradation and blow-up.

The  above  arguments  in  favour  of  RCB  have  been
checked out by the computer simulations of the beam-
beam effects in the VEPP-2M collider lattice, modified
to  the  RCB  option[7].  The  main  results  of  the  simula-
tions[8]  are  presented  in  Fig.  1,  where  the  beam  sizes
are plotted versus the space charge parameter ξ.  One

can see that the beam blow-up for the round beam op-
tion is much weaker than what is simulated by the same
code  for  flat  colliding  beams  (dashed  line).  The  simu-
lations have also demonstrated stability of RCB against
the  “flip-flop”  effect,  similarly  to  conclusions  from
simple flip-flop models[9].

3 DESIGN OF VEPP-2000

3.1 Magnets

The lack of space for placing the new machine lead
to  demand  on  using  of  strong  dipole  magnets.  For  the
energy of particles in the beam to be 1 GeV the field of
a  magnitude  2.3  T  is  needed.  For  this  purpose  it  is
planned  to  use  the  construction  of  magnets  of  booster
BEP [10] that works at the  level  of  the  magnetic  field
needed.  The  parameters  of  magnets  are  shown  in  Ta-
ble 1.

3.2 Solenoids

Focusing in the two interaction regions is performed
by  SC  solenoids,  installed  symmetrically  with  respect
to  the  IPs.  Each  solenoidal  block  consists  of  a  main
solenoid which is longitudinally divided into two parts,
and  a  compensating  solenoid  with  reverse  field  to  ad-
just  longitudinal  field  integral  and  focussing.  Such  a
scheme gives an additional possibility to control the B
value by feeding only one half of the main solenoid at
lower energies. 

The solenoid coil is divided into three sections: inner
3Nb Sn
section  has  thickness  30  mm  and  is  made  of 
3Nb Sn );
wire 1.23 mm in diameter (50%  Cu  + 50% 
middle section has thickness 20 mm and is wound with
a  NbTi   wire  1.2  mm  in  diameter  (48%  Cu   +  52%
NbTi ) and outer layer has thickness of 10 mm, made
of  NbTi  wire 0.85 mm in diameter (48%  Cu  + 52%
NbTi ). To feed this three-section coil we plan to use
two  power  supply  units.  Connection  scheme  implies
that  the  current  in  the  outer  section  is  the  sum  of  cur-
rents  in  the  inner  ones.  The  distribution  of  currents  in

Magnetic  flux  is  closed  by  the  iron  return  yoke  lo-
cated together with all the coils in a common LHe cry-
ostat. Aperture of the coil is 50.0 mm. The inner tube of
the  helium  vessel  is  a  part  of  the  collider  vacuum
chamber.  A  nitrogen  vapour  cooled  liner  is  envisaged
to protect the surface of the helium cryostat from heat-
ing by synchrotron radiation.

3.3 RF System

Beam revolution frequency is 12.292 MHz. The  ac-
celerating RF frequency was chosen at 14-th revolution
frequency  harmonic  i.e.  172  MHz.  With  accelerating
3σ =  cm
voltage of 100 kV the bunch length is about 
at the energy of 1 GeV. Energy loss per turn is 64 keV,
and  with  colliding  beam  currents  of  2 0.1×
  A  the
power delivered to the beams is 12.8 kW. The so-called
single-mode cavity is proposed to be used to ease sup-
pression  of  coherent  instabilities,  see  Fig.  7.  Two  co-
axial damping loads  are  foreseen  to  absorb  the  energy
from  high-order  modes  excitation.  The  fundamental
mode  is  isolated  from  the  upper  load  by  the  tunable
choke.

Fig. 7 Cross-section of the cavity

The RF field distribution of accelerating mode on the
axis of the RF cavity is shown in Fig. 8.

bution on the cavity axis (lower picture)

3.4 Vacuum System

The  high-vacuum  system  consists  of  16  ports  with
iongetter  pumps  PVIG-100,  which  are  located  at  the
edges  of  bending  magnets  vacuum  chambers;  of  ion-
getter pump PVIG-250 connected to the RF cavity; of 4
cryopumps formed of cool solenoid surface. To prevent
heating cryosurface, which is under 4.2 K, by SR there
is planned to use perforated liner cooled with the liquid
nitrogen. The liners ports should provide linear pump-
ing  rate  of  5  l/s/cm  for  the  nitrogen.  The  cool  surface
under  4.2  K  is  an  ideal  pumping  for  all  the  residual
gases  but  the  hydrogen,  because  after  accumulation
more than one cryosrpted hydrogen monolayer the satu-
rated vapor pressure of the hydrogen reaches the value
of 
 Torr under given temperature. In spite of this
circumstance  our  calculations  showed  that  in  general
the beam life time will depend on residual CO pressure.
Numerical simulation of the pressure over the ring was
performed under following conditions:

4 BEAM INJECTION
The  injection  of  beams  into  the  storage  ring  is
planned to be done in the horizontal plane into the long
drift  opposite  to  the  RF  cavity  (see  the  Fig.  2).  The
inflector  plates  will  be  placed  on  the  inner  side  of  the
vacuum chamber in the bending magnets at the ends of
the drift. The advantage of such a scheme is independ-
ence  of  the  injected  beam  trajectory  on  the  solenoids
field. This gives us an opportunity to test different op-
tions of optics: usual round beams, “Möbius”, and flat
beams  with  zero  rotation  of  the  betatron  oscillation
plane.

In  Table  3  the  main  parameters  of  generators  are

collected.

The  BEP  booster  is  capable  of  production  beams
with the energy of up to 900 MeV.  Thus,  operation  at
lower energies will be continuous, with injection of the
beam  at  the  experiment  energy.  In  region  from  900
MeV  to  1  GeV  the  energy  ramping  from  900  MeV  to
the experiment energy is required.

An  essential  advantage  of  the  found  optics  is  zero

feature.  Variation  of  the  focusing  strength  of  the  sole-

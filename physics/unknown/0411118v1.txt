ABSTRACT:  In  this  paper  we  have  studied  the  influence  of  reversed  shear  on  the  improvement  of  the 
confinement’s quality in the plasma of tokamak and especially in reducing the anomalous transport. For that, we have 
used a special model for the drift wave fields. Comparison between particles trajectories for normal and reversed shear 
is  carried  out  in  2  D  and  3  D  presentation.  Also,  the  diffusion  coefficient  of  particles  for  the  two  cases,  normal  and 
negative shear, is evaluated.

INTRODUCTION:  The  anomalous  transport  in 
the plasmas of tokamak has been studied for many years, all 
over the world, in order to control thermonuclear fusion. It is 
very well known that the destruction of the magnetic surfaces 
which are responsible for plasma confinement, the stochastic 
region’s  formation,  the  anomalous  transport  of  particles  and 
energy,  etc,  resulting  in  magnetohydrodynamic  instabilities, 
electrostatic  and  magnetic  turbulence  and  the  phenomena  of 
the  confinement. 
the  deterioration  of 
drift,  drive 
Concerning  this  fact,  all  effort  in  this  sense  requires  the 
understanding  of 
the 
instabilities that exist in the plasmas of the tokamak and the 
development of reliable theoretical models that are capable of 
the  complex  dynamics  of  fusion’s  plasma 
describing 
[3,5,6,7,8,9].  In  this  work,  we  are  interested-  firstly-  in  the 
survey of the dynamics of the lines of magnetic fields, and of 
plasma ’s particles in the ulterior stage.  
The other very important point that we will develop in this 
work consists of studying the contribution of the reversed 
shear to the improvement of the plasma’s confinement in the 
tokamak and  other rules of improvement of the confinement. 
Indeed, the research concentrates currently more on the 
control of these improved confinement régimes that have 
been observed during the last decade. These are the régimes 
where we observe the plasma diffusion’s reduction, and what 
is impressive is the formation of the transport barrier. We say 
the word “barrier” because it opposes the motion of the 
particles anomalous diffusion taking the shape of an obstacle 
to particles of plasma. We studied the motion of the guiding 
center of particles, under the action of electrostatic field 
perturbation, and in a configuration known as of reversed 
magnetic shear. This configuration is adopted more and more 
in the new machines of fusion, since we observe important 
reductions there in the diffusion coefficients. The equations 
of the motion of the guiding center will be replaced by 
equations of the mapping known as Nontwist Standard 
Mapping, and in the phases space of the particles, we 
simulated the trajectory in two completely different cases of 
the safety factor profile: the normal profile and the reversed 
one. In the normal case, the trajectory can be described by 
the KAM theory, while in the reversed case the dynamic is 
described by the formation of the transport barrier of the 
particles that are localized in the neighborhood of the 
resonance surface that corresponds to the minimum of q. This 
surface confines plasma and reduces its diffusion.

Choice of the profiles of the factor of security :  

 
The trajectories will already be solved numerically 
according 
this  formulation  of  established  mapping. 
However,  we  are  going  to  return  more  importance  to  the 
control  parameter  q,  and  we  are  going  to  work  in  two 
configuration cases that are completely different.

We define two q- profiles of (Figure 1. ):

Simulations & interpretations :  

 
In presence of the electrostatic perturbations and 

the normal profile of the safety coefficient q, the stochasticity 
                                      
of the trajectories increases and it is the principle reason for 
the particles’ diffusion through the magnetic surfaces 
(Figure 2. (b)).  

While in the case of reversed shear, the principle 
result shows that the transport barrier is near of surface that 
corresponds to the minimal value of q exists. This barrier 
plays an important role on the reduction of the transport and 
the diffusion of the particles, which drives to the 
improvement of the plasma confinement (Figure 2. (a)).  
In the case of the 3- dimensional simulation, we 

observe the same phenomena as those in the case of 2- 
dimensional simulation except that we do not see the 
formation of islands, and what we observe is a transition of 
the particles from the regions (r/a < 0.5) toward regions (r/a 
> 0.5).  

While increasing the amplitude of the perturbation, 

and in the reversed case (Figure 3. (a)) we observe that this 
transition drives to a transition of this barrier toward the 
outside regions of the tokamak ( r/a →1) to prevent the 
diffusion of these particles. Whereas in the normal case 
(Figure 3. (b)), we observe that the majority of the particles 
escaped which means that we observe the total destruction of 
the magnetic surfaces of the confinement.

II - NUMERICAL INTEGRATION AND 
INTERPRETATIONS :  
 

In  the  next  section,  we  neglect  the  electric  field 
radial component and investigate the map phase structure by 
calculating  1000  massive  D+  trajectories  with  various  initial 
conditions  in  configuration  spaces  for  the  reversed  and 
normal shear cases of the safety factor.  

                                                 

and  we  represented  time  evolution  of  the  ratio  of  diffusion 
coefficient in reversed shear (Dr) on diffusion coefficient in 
the  normal  case  (Dn)  for  deferent  values of the perturbation 
(Figure  4.).  Here  tn  is  a  time  step,  We  observe  a  large 
reduction of particles diffusion in the reversed case due to the 
transport  barrier  which  have  tendency  to  suppress  the 
anomalous  transport.  The  diffusion  in  the  reversed  case 
become  lower  than  those  in  the  normal  case.  And  the 
formation  of  transport  barrier  which  suppress  turbulent 
transport may explain this reduction [4].  

Finally, we represented the same ratio but now as 

function of the amplitude of perturbation  for deferent values 
of tn (Figure 5.).

III - THE DIFFUSION OF THE PARTICLES :  

 
To evaluate the plasma particles’ diffusion through 
the  magnetic  surfaces  within  the  tokamak  reactors,  we 
simulated  in  two  case  the  particulate  diffusion  coefficients. 
We expressed it under the most classic formula as follows:

At the neighbourhood of the plasma border, the 

radial electric field Er decreases, what drives to the reduction 
of the potential electrostatic Fr, thereafter to the reduction of 
the flight of the plasma ions and therefore the reduction of 
the anomalous transport with the shear.  

 
CONCLUSION & PERSPECTIVES:  

 
Anomalous transport observed in tokamaks is 

known as the result of the electrostatic and magnetic 
turbulence. thus, in the presence of electric perturbation and 
for the normal profile of the safety factor q, the stochasticity 
of the trajectories increases and this is the principal cause of 
diffusion of particles through magnetic surfaces. However for 
the reversed shear case, the most important result is the 
impressive formation of a strong transport barrier, which is 
localized near of minimum value of q (q is  the safety factor) 
(Figure 2. (a)). This barrier plays a very important role in the 
improvement of the plasma confinement while preventing its 
radial diffusion. To evaluate quantitatively the diffusion, we 
simulated from the Mapping equations, the diffusion 
coefficient in each of the two previous cases, and we drew 
the ratio that shows a clean reduction in the diffusion 
observed in the reversed magnetic shear profile. Therefore, 
the diffusion decreases, the confinement improves and the 
control of the fusion reactors to function in these modes 
permits the reduction of the anomalous transport in the 
tokamaks.  

Lately, there has been consensus on an 
international scale to construct a big experimental reactor in 
Cadarache ITER: International Thermonuclear Experimental 
Reactor. In this project, Europe, the USA, Canada, Australia, 
Japan and China will participate. The launch of this project in 
France is going to be a big step in the success of 
thermonuclear energy production. In this setting, and in 
perspective, we are going to reproduce the same simulations 
with the parameters of ITER to be able to compare them with 
those obtained for TEXT.

ABSTRACT

Sustaining  human  life  at  the  Earth’s  antipodal  Polar  Regions  is  very  difficult  especially  during 
Winter  when  water-freezing  air  temperature,  blizzards  and  "whiteouts"  make  normal  human 
existence  dangerous.  To  counter  these  environmental  stresses,  we  offer  the  innovative  artificial 
"Evergreen"  Polar  Zone  Dome  (EPZD),  an  inflated  half-hemisphere  with  interiors  continuously 
providing a Mediterranean Sea-like climate. The "Evergreen" EPZD structural theory is developed, 
substantiated  by  key  computations  that  show  it  is  possible  for  current  building  technology  to 
construct  and  heat  large  enclosed  volumes  inexpensively.  Specifically,  a  satisfactory  result  is 
reached by using sunlight reflectors and a special double thin film, which concentrates all available 
solar energy inside the EPZD while, at the same time markedly decreasing the heat loss to exterior
Polar  Region  air.  Someday  a  similar,  but  remarkably  more  technological,  EPZD  design  may  be 
employed at proposed Moon and Mars settlements.          
  Key words: artificial hemisphere, inflatable film building, Polar Region homes, solar energy concentrator. 

I. INTRODUCTION
Particularly during  Winter, the  Earth’s two Polar  Regions  provide  only a  meager  and uncomfortable 
life-style for humans, featuring very low ambient air temperature, strong wind, and seasonal darkness.  
Starting from Cape Artichesky (Russia), Mike Horn and Borge Ousland completed, during January to 
March 2006, the first known over-pack ice trek to the planet’s geographic North Pole during darkness!  
More  persons  are  likely  to  undertake  such  journeys  near  the  Arctic  Ocean’s  coast  when  permanent 
dwellings  are  situated  closer  to  the  North  Pole.    The  purpose  of  our  report  is  to  make  possible 
economical new cities at both Polar Regions of the Earth.  

Economists allege that the mean 2006 USA Dollar value of Polar Region land territory is generally low 
compared  to  the  world  total  of  ~$250,000/km2.    For  example:  Antarctica  ~$40/km2,  Greenland 
~$650/km2,  Canada  ~$77,000/km2  and  Russia  ~$106,000/km2. 
  However,  world  economic 
productivity data show that the 2006 USA dollar output per capita in the Earth-biosphere is greatest in 
Polar Regions; cold regions have output per capita that is approximately 10-12 times that of the Earth’s 
Tropic Zones!  The distance north or south from the planet’s Equator is amongst the most significant 
measured  environmental  variables  underlying  the  differences  expressed  in  per  capita  USA  dollar 
output  by  country-ecosystem,  but  this  is  probably  explained  by  the  overall  global  pattern  of  human 
settlement, which tends to influence social institutions and their supportive technologies.1  
  In  other  words,  if  persons  living  at  the  Polar  Regions were  made  more  comfortable  than  now,  it  is 
very  probable  that  the  economic  value  per  square  kilometer  of  territory  situated  in  those  two

geographical  regions  would  decrease  slightly  since  only  very  poor  persons  (nomadic  natives  in  the 
Northern  Hemisphere)  and  highly  paid  persons  (technicians  and  scientists2)  dwell  fulltime  in  the 
Earth’s  Polar  Regions  nowadays!    Non-nomadic  people  currently  work  in  these  uncomfortably  cold 
and  seasonally  dark  climate  settlements  only  because  there  are  known  mineral,  natural  gas  and 
petroleum  deposits  to  be  mined,  along  with  seasonal  and  non-seasonal  hydroelectric  facilities3  to  be 
efficiently operated for the benefit of large populations living in warmer climates away from primary 
production places.  There is every reason to think that valuable Arctic and Antarctica resources remain 
undiscovered,  awaiting  future  exploration  and  industrial  exploitation.    The  Arctic  alone  has  proven 
discovered oil and natural gas deposits equal to 40% of Saudi Arabia’s total reserves.4  Many people 
worldwide, especially in the Temperate Zones, muse on the possibility of humans someday inhabiting 
orbiting  Space  Settlements  and  Moon  Bases  or  a  terraformed  Mars  but  few  seem  to  contemplate  an 
increased use of ~25% of Earth’s surface—the Polar Regions.5  Antarctica is being investigated for its 
economic  potential6  and  already  the  Antarctic  Circumpolar  Current  has  been  affected  by  global 
civilization.7

II. ARCTIC  
Geoscience  has  generally  substantiated  that  the  Arctic  is  warming  and  eventually  it  may  reach  a 
seasonally  “ice-free”  state  caused  by  the  absence  of  new  sea-ice  due  to  non-formation  as  well  as 
summertime excess sublimation of glaciers on land during the 21st Century.8  Climatological feedback 
loops,  which  effect  change,  are  the  interplay  between  sea/land  ice,  North  Atlantic  Ocean  currents—
especially the Gulf Stream and the north-flowing current in the Bering Strait—and the annual amounts 
of  precipitation  and  evaporation  in  the  Arctic.    Reduced  sea-ice  extent  and  thickness  in  the  Arctic 
Ocean  would  promote  regular  summertime  commercial  shipping,  and  present  new  opportunities  for 
offshore  oil  and  gas  extraction.    A  Northern  Sea  Route  paralleling  the  Siberian  coastline  would  be 
~40% shorter than the current Europe-Asia Route which requires a passage through the Suez Canal.9  
In  addition,  new  macroprojects—opportunistic  hydroelectric  power  development  of  diminishing 
glaciers  and a  permanent  tunnel or bridge15 across  the Bering Strait—may  attract  new settlers  to  the 
Arctic.  There is also the possibility, as we explore here, for Arctic Zone greenhouses under inflated 
membrane half-hemispheres producing fresh fruits and vegetables for workers on such macroprojects 
and  to  luxuriously  house  at  low-cost  workers  seeking  to  maintain  the  present-day  natural  stock  of 
Arctic Ocean sea-ice by construction of artificial ice islands.10

III. ‘EVERGREEN’ INFLATED DOMES
Possibly  the  first  true  architectural  attempt  at  constructing  effective  artificial  life-support  systems  in 
climatically  harsh  regions  in  the  Earth-biosphere  was  the  building  of  greenhouses.    Extensive 
commercial  greenhouses  in  The  Netherlands—and  even  outer  space11—are  maintained  nearly 
automatically by heating, cooling, irrigation, nutrition and plant disease management equipment.  The 
“Climatron”  greenhouse  was  finished  in  1959  at  the  Missouri  Botanical  Garden  in  St.  Louis,  USA, 
while the world’s most voluminous greenhouses,  the Eden Project, were completed in Cornwall, UK 
during  the  early  21st  Century.12    All  people  share  commonalities  in  their  responses  to  natural 
environmental stresses that are stimulated by extremely cold air, snowstorms and strong wind.  In the 
Arctic  and  Antarctica,  life-threatening  “whiteout”  snowstorms  inflict  somewhat  the  same  personal 
visual  discomfort and  disorientation  as  cosmonauts/astronauts  experience during their  space-walks—
that of being adrift in featureless outer space!  With special clothing and shelters, humans can adapt to 
these Polar Regions successfully.   Medical researchers have  asserted that  “…cold-related deaths  are 
far  more  numerous  than  heat-related  deaths  in  the  United  States,  Europe,  and  almost  all  countries 
outside of the tropics, and almost all of them are due to common illnesses that are increased by cold.”13  
Incontrovertibly,  living  near  the  planet’s  poles  is  stressful  and  operationally  difficult,  even  when 
tempered by strong conventional  buildings such  as those  at  the Earth’s South  Pole where  the  Ozone 
Hole causes a UVB radiation hazard that cannot be ignored because it helps cause sunburn (erythema) 
2

3
and  snow  blindness  (photokeratitis);  the  Arctic  also  has  a  UVB  radiation  hazard.    The  morale  of 
personnel—a  difficult  factor  to  measure—during  wintertime  when  little  daylight  and  little  contrast 
between  land,  sea  and  sky  predominates  can  cause  monotony,  a  negative  influence  on  personnel 
activity  and  efficiency.    Essentially,  any  EPZD  becomes  the  total  environment  of  its  inhabitants,  so 
proper internal  temperature control  and soundproofing are vital.   Relative  humidity inside the EPZD 
ought to be fixed at 30-40% for human comfort and health reasons and to insure that static electricity 
does not become a problem affecting safety in the EPZD.

The  first  “Evergreen”-type  dwelling  hemisphere  design  “City  in  the  Arctic”  was  commissioned  by 
Germany’s  Farbwerke  Hoechst  AG  in  1970.14    “City  in  the  Arctic”  was  a  pneumatically  stabilized 
climate-regulating  transparent  membrane  half-sphere  shell  with  a  diameter  2,000  to  2,200  m  and  a 
height of about 240 m intended to  comfortably  enable 15,000 to 45,000  workers.  The  contemplated 
membrane was to be reinforced and supported by a net of intersecting, braided polyester fiber cables.  
Better  21st  Century  materials  are  available  that  would  improve  the  formidable  performance 
characteristics  of  “City  in  the  Arctic”.15      Founded  in  1956,  Birdair,  Inc.  in  the  USA,  introduced  its 
Sheerfill in 1970 and  this constantly improved  material offers  translucencies of ~25%.  The energy 
impact of Sheerfill, and other nearly non-combustible architectural technical textiles16, is a function of 
the  tradeoff  between  decreased  lighting  needs  and  increased  heating  costs;  a  dynamic  air-supported 
membrane building normally costs only about 33% of a building assembled with ordinary materials.17  
(More  technologies  will  be  revealed  at  The  Twelfth  International  Workshop  on  the  Design  and 
Practical Realization of Architectural Membrane Structures, “Textile Roofs 2007”, held 7-9 June 2007 
in  Berlin,  Germany.)  “City  in  the  Arctic”  was  never  built  because  it  was  merely  an  architectural 
speculation, even less substantial than the architectural speculations of Sotirios Kotoulas in Space Out
(Springer, 2006). 

Our  macro-engineering  concept  of  inexpensive-to-construct  and  operate  “Evergreen”  inflated  Earth-
surface  domes  is  supported  by  computations,  making  our  macroproject  speculation  more  than  a 
daydream.    However,  we  lack  access  to  a  low-speed  laboratory  wind  tunnel  and  that  inhibits  our 
apprehension of wall interference and the effect of some layout details, such as open or closed doors 
facing the EPZD exterior.  Innovations are needed, and wanted, to realize such structures in the Polar 
Regions of our unique but continuously changing planet.

IV. DESCRIPTION AND INNOVATIONS
Our design for an Arctic people-housing “Evergreen” dome is presented in Fig. 1, which includes the 
thin  inflated  film  dome.    Air-supported  construction  derives  from  the  balloon  principle  to  shape  a 
building;  the  air  pressure  inside  the  building  exceeds  the  external  air  pressure  to  support  the  roof.  
Sunlight  can  penetrate  special  roofing  materials,  making  the  interiors  brighter  than  others  types  of 
constructed buildings.  The EPZD innovations are listed here: (1) the construction is air-inflatable; (2) 
each  dome  is  fabricated  with  very  thin,  transparent  film  (thickness  is  0.1  to  0.2  mm)  without  rigid 
supports;  (3)  the  enclosing  film  is  a  two-layered  element  with  air  between  the  layers  to  provide 
insulation; (4) the construction form is that of a hemisphere, or in the instance of a roadway/railway a 
half-tube,  and  part  of  it  has  a  thin  aluminum  layer  about  1    or  less  that  functions  as  the  gigantic 
collector  of  solar  incident  solar  radiation  (heat).    Surplus  heat  collected  may  be  used  to  generate 
electricity  or  furnish  mechanical  energy;  and  (5)  the  dome  is  equipped  with  sunlight  controlling 
louvers [AKA, “jalousie”, a blind or shutter having adjustable slats to regulate the passage of air and 
sunlight]  with  one  side  thinly  coated  with  reflective  polished  aluminum  of  about  1  .    Real-time 
control of the sunlight’s entrance into the dome and nighttime heat’s exit is governed by the shingle-
like louvers.

Fig.  1  illustrates  the  thin  transparent  dome  cover  we  envision.    The  hemispherical  inflated  textile 
shell—technical  “textiles”  can  be  woven  or  non-woven  (films)—embodies  the  EPZD  innovations 
listed: (1) the film is very thin, approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mm.  A film this thin has never before been 
used in a major building; (2) the film has two strong nets, with a mesh of about 0.1  0.1 m and a = 1 
1 m, the threads are about 0.3 mm for a small mesh and about 1 mm for a big mesh.  The net prevents 
the watertight and airtight film covering from being damaged by vibration; (3) the film incorporates a 
tiny electrically conductive wire net with a mesh about 0.01 x 0.01 m and a line width of about 100 
and a thickness near 1.  The wire net can inform  the “Evergreen” dome supervisors concerning the 
place and size of film damage (tears, rips, etc.); (4) the film is twin-layered with the gap — c = 1 m 
and  b  =  2  m—between  covering’s  layers.    This  multi-layered  covering  is  the  main  means  for  heat 
insulation and puncture of one of the layers wont cause a loss of shape because the film’s second layer 
is unaffected by holing; (5) the airspace in the dome’s covering can be partitioned, either hermetically 
or not; (6) the units #5 of the cover is furnished with a heat tube #6 that can spray warmed anti-freeze 
liquid onto the EPZD’s  exterior, thus eliminating snow  and ice buildup;  and (7) part of the  covering 
has a very thin shiny aluminum coating that is about 1 for reflection of incoming solar radiation.

V. THEORY AND COMPUTATIONS EPZD
As wind flows over and around a fully exposed, nearly completely sealed inflated dome, the weather 
affecting  the  external  film  on  the  windward  side  must  endure  positive  air  pressures  as  the  wind 
stagnates.  Simultaneously, low air pressure eddies will be present on the leeward side of the dome.  In 
other words, air pressure gradients caused by air density differences on different parts of the sheltering 
dome’s  envelope  is  characterized  as  the  “buoyancy  effect”.    The  buoyancy  effect  will  be  greatest 
during  the  coldest  weather  when  the  EPZD  is  heated  and  the  temperature  difference  between  its 
interior  and  exterior  are  greatest.   In extremely  cold  climates,  such  as  the  Arctic and  Antarctica,  the 
buoyancy  effect  tends  to  dominate  dome  pressurization,  causing  the  EPZD  to  require  reliable 
anchoring.

Our basic computed equations, below, are derived from a Russian-language textbook.18  Solar radiation 
impinging the orbiting Earth is approximately 1400 W/m2.  The average Earth reflection by clouds and 
the sub-aerial surfaces (water, ice and land) is about 0.3.  The Earth-atmosphere adsorbs about 0.2 of 
the  Sun’s  radiation.    That  means  about  q0  =  700  W/m2s  of  solar  energy  (heat)  reaches  our  planet’s 
surface at the Equator.  The solar spectrum is graphed in Fig. 4.

The visible part of the Sun’s spectrum is only  = 0.4 to 0.8 ..  Any warm body emits radiation.  The 
emission wavelength depends on the body’s temperature.  The wavelength of the maximum intensity 
(see Fig. 4) is governed by the black-body law originated by Max Planck (1858-1947):

the wavelength is m = 9.9 .

Boltzmann law.

As  the  reader  will  notice,  the  shiny  aluminum  louver  coating  is  excellent  mean  jalousie  against 
radiation losses from the dome.

The general radiation heat Q computes by equation [6].  Equations [1] – [9] allow computation of the 
heat balance and comparison of incoming heat (gain) and outgoing heat (loss).
The computations of heat balance of a dome of any size in the coldest wintertime of the Polar Regions 
are presented in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. Daily heat balance through 1 m2 of EPZD during coldest winter day versus Earth's latitude (North

film is c1 = 0.9; convectively coefficients are 1= 2 = 30; thickness of film layers are 1= 2 =0.0001 m; 
thickness of air layer is  = 1 m; coefficient of film heat transfer is 1= 3 = 0.75, for air 2 = 0.0244; ratio of 
cover blackness 1= 3 = 0.9, for louvers 2 = 0.05. 

The heat from combusted fuel is found by equation

where ct is heat rate of fuel [J/kg]; ct = 40 MJ/kg for liquid oil fuel; m is fuel mass, kg;  is efficiency 
of heater,  = 0.5 - 0.8. 
The  thickness  of  the  dome  envelope,  its  sheltering  shell  of  film,  is  computed  by  formulas  (from

When the need arises, sometimes the internal pressure can be voluntarily decreased, bled off.
    In Fig. 7 the alert reader has noticed: the daily heat loss is about the solar heat in the very coldest 
Winter day when a dome located above 600 North or South Latitude and the outside air temperature is 
–50  0C.  Let us compute and compare the heat extension for conventional buildings located on same 
region with and without the “Evergreen” dome.
   Assume  the  two-story  building,  perhaps  a  home  or  small  office,  occupies  0.1  part  of  domed  area.  
That means their walls and roof is equal to 0.5 part of dome area.  Assume the building walls have a 
thickness of 0.2 m and are formed of baked bricks ( = 0.758 W/m.K).  The differences of temperature 
are 20  +  50 = 70  0C  (T1 = 293  0K,  T2 =  223  0K).  So, 1  m2 of building surface has  a heat loss,  in  1 
second

q = 0.7580.570/0.2 = 132.65   W/m2.s .

The radiation heat loss from 1 m2 dome at night when the jalousies are closed tightly is

Transfer heat loss is 6.86 + 2.75 = 9.61 W/m2 <132.62 W/m2.  The heat loss of the dome is less than 14 
times the heat of the buildings inside unprotected by an inflated dome.
    We  consider  a  two-layer  dome  film  and  one  heat  screen.    If  needed,  better  protection  can  further 
reduce the head losses as we can utilize inflated dome covers with more layers and more heat screens.  
One heat screen decreases heat losses by 2, two screens can decrease heat flow by 3 times, three by 4

times,  and  so  on.    If  the  Polar  Region  domes  have  a  mesh  structure,  the  heat  transfer  decreases 
proportional to the summary thickness of its enveloping film layers.

VI. MACROPROJECTS
The EPZD innovations outlined here can be practically applied to other climatic regimes (from Polar to 
Tropical).  We suggest initial macroprojects could be small (10 m diameter) houses (Fig. 3) followed 
by an “Evergreen” dome in the Arctic or Antarctica covering a land area 200  1000 m, with irrigated 
vegetation, homes, open-air swimming pools, playground.
The  house  and  “Evergreen”  dome  have  several  innovations:  Sun  reflector,  double  transparent 
insulating  film,  controllable  jalousies  coated  with  reflective  aluminum  and  an  electronic  cable  mesh 
inherent to the film for dome safety/integrity monitoring purposes.  By undertaking to construct a half-
sphere  house,  we  can  acquire  experience  in  such  constructions  and  explore  more  complex 
constructions.  By computation, a 10 m diameter home has a useful floor area of 78.5 m2, airy interior 
volume of 262 m3 covered by an envelope with an exterior area of 157 m2.  It film enclosure material 
would have a thickness of 0.0002 mm with a total mass of 65 kg.

A  city-enclosing  “Evergreen”  dome  of  200    1000  m  (Fig.  1,  with  spherical  end  caps)  could  have 
calculated characteristics: useful area = 2.3  105 m2, useful volume 17.8  106 m3, exterior dome area 
of  3.75    105  m2  comprised  of  a  film  of  0.0002  mm  thickness  and  145  tonnes.    If  the  “Evergreen” 
dome were formed with concrete 0.2 m thick, the mass of the city-size envelope would be 173  103
tonnes,  which  is  a  thousand  times  heavier.    Also,  just  for  comparison,  if  we  made  a  gigantic 
“Evergreen”  dome  with  stiff  glass,  thousands  of  tonnes  of  steel,  glass  would  be  necessary  and  such 
materials  would  be  very  costly  to  transport  hundreds,  possibly  thousands,  of  kilometers  to  the  site 
where they would be assembled by highly-paid workers.  Our non-woven textile (film) is flexible and 
plastic can be relatively cheap.  The single greatest boon to “Evergreen” dome construction, whether in 
the  Earth’s  Polar  Regions  or  elsewhere,  is  the  protected  cultivation  of  plants  within  a  dome  that 
generates energy from the available and technically harnessed sunlight.  However, the North and South 
Poles may, during the 21st Century, become places of cargo and passenger congregation since a Cable 
Space  Transportation  System,  installed  on  Antarctica’s  ice-cap  and  on  a  floating  artificial  ice  island 
has been proposed the would transfer people and things to and from the Moon.19  

VII. DISCUSSION
As  with  any  innovative  macroproject  proposal,  the  reader  will  naturally  have  many  questions.    We 
offer brief answers to the four most obvious questions our readers are likely to ponder.
(1) How can snow and ice be removed from the dome?

After a snowfall, weather conditions permitting, a helicopter can hover over the dome, blowing 
off  the  accumulated  loose  snow.    Compacted  snow  and  ice  can  be  removed  by  activating  remotely 
operated sprayers that squirt warmed anti-freeze liquid onto the dome’s exterior.  Such deicer must not 
be toxic like those currently used at airports.20  The film cover is flexible and has a lift force of about 
100 kg/m2.  We imagine that a controlled change of interior air pressure will serve to shake the snow 
and ice off.  Such a technology is used in aircraft for wing de-icing.
(2) Storm wind.

This was thoroughly considered in Section V, above.

 (3) Cover damage.

The  envelope  contains  a  cable  mesh  so  that  the  film  cannot  be  damaged  greatly.    Its  double 
layering  structure  governs  the  escape  of  heated  air  inside  the  living  zone.    Electronic  signals  alert 
supervising  personnel  of  any  rupture  problems  and  permit  a  speedy  repair  effort  by  well-trained 
persons.
 (4) What is the design life of the film covering?

10

Depending  on  the  kind  of  materials  used,  it  may  be  as  much  a  decade.    In  all  or  in  part,  the 

cover can be replaced periodically.

VIII. CONCLUSION
“Evergreen”  domes  can  foster  the  fuller  economic  development  of  cold  regions  such  as  the  Earth’s 
Arctic and Antarctic and, thus, increase the effective area of territory dominated by humans.  Normal 
human  health  can  be  maintained  by  ingestion  of  locally  grown  fresh  vegetables  and  healthful 
“outdoor”  exercise.    “Evergreen”  domes  can  also  be  used  in  the  Tropics  and  Temperate  Zone.  
Eventually, they may find application on the Moon or Mars since a vertical variant, inflatable towers to 
outer space21, are soon to become available for launching spacecraft inexpensively into Earth-orbit or 
interplanetary flights22-26.

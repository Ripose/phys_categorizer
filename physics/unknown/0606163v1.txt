ABSTRACT  

I  present  the  background  of  a  question  I  asked  Richard  Matzner  at  the  John 

Wheeler astrophysics school in Erice, at the Majorana institute of scientific culture during 

May 31st -June 8th.  with an extension of the question to the issue of possible light cone 

deformation. This possibly has relevance to the stability of numerical algorithms used in 

modeling  gravitational  waves  from  Schwartzshield  metric  solutions  of  black  holes  and 

similar objects. This involves the so called momentum 

αβK

of a geodestic

αβg

, with its re 

casting  in  a  Kerr  shield  co  ordinates  of  the  Schwartzshield  metric.  for  two  black  holes 

which have anti parallel spins but which exhibit spin coupling between them.

INTRODUCTION 

I wish first of all to thank Richard Matzner of the UT Austin relativity center for a 

very  clear  and  illuminating  introduction  to  the  topic  of  numerical  simulations  of 

gravitational  wave  generation  in  general  relativity.  The  topic  being  presented  is  an 

abbreviated introduction to part of his lecture, as a setting to an issue of ‘symmetry’ of 

the  ‘momentum’

αβK

  of  the  geodestic  ‘data’ 

αβg

  of  a  schwartzschild  metric  used  in 

numerical  simulations  of  gravity  waves.  The  first  part  of  the  question  which  I  present 

here  was  given  an  extensive  answer  by  Dr.  Matzner  which  will  show  up  in  the 

proceedings of the 1

st inaugural John Wheeler School of astrophysics. The second part of 

the question which I am introducing here, with its extensions to light cones is something 

which I did not raise in the question and answer period, but which I think is extremely 

significant  as  to  the  issue  of  the  behavior  of  light  cones  and  their  interactions  in 

gravitational  wave  simulations.  It  was  not  raised,  but  was  shown  Richard  Matzner,  and 

was omitted due to wishing to keep a reasonably orderly question and answer period, and 

not  over  taxing  the  patience  of  note  takers  who  were  supposed  to  transcribe  each  and 

every question and the subsequent answers of the conference proceedings.  

I  will  leave  the  full  details  of  the  answer  to  question  I  managed  to  ask  Richard 

Matzner  in  the  question  and  answer  period  to  the  fore  coming  conference  proceedings 

and will, instead concentrate upon the second question which I do believe has interesting 

physics and should be at some time professionally investigated.  This will necessitate an 

abbreviated  introduction  to  the  physics  of  this  topic  partly  along  the  lines  Richard 

Matzner  made  available  to  John  Wheeler  astrophysics  conference  ,  and  then  the  brief 

introduction  to  the  topic  I  wish  to  ask  about  ,  namely  how  light  cones  are  affected  by

IMPLICATIONS OF NON ZERO ‘MOMENTUM’ OF (
TERMS OF SPIN AND TWO INTERACTING BLACK HOLES 
 

)0≠αβK

IN 

What  already  has  been  raised  by  me  in  a  question  and  answer  session  at  the 

Wheeler  astrophysics  school1  with  Richard  Matzner  was  the  following  question. 

QUESTION 1: 

If  there  exist  two  black  holes  with  anti  parallel  spins,  then  if  the  coupling  between  the 

spins of the two black holes is monotonically decreasing, does this mean that 

αβK

 is also 

monotonically decreasing?  

As stated, Richard Matzners long, answer to this question will be included in full 

details  in  the  John  Wheeler  astrophysics  proceedings  to  be  released  by  the  Majorana 

institute  of  Erice1.  But  it  leads  to  the  following  observation  as  discussed  with  both 

Richard  Matzner,  and  with  other  scientists  at  the  meeting.  Namely  that  we  have  the 

opposite  phenomena  here  occurring  from  electromagnetism,  namely 

that  since 

 

- 5 - 

 

gravitational masses in general relativity attract as a primary effect, we need to consider 

secondary effects as well, namely.  

 QUESTION 2 
Does  the  existence  of  a  monotonically  decreasing  Kerr-Schild  representation  of 

(

≠αβK

)0

imply deformations in the light cone of the system where two black holes may 

be interacting in? 

I argue this is an extremely non trivial consideration for the following reason. In 

an article written by Blaut, A.; et al4, about doubly special relativity, the authors write the 

following  in  their  introduction,  namely  that  they  are  considering    Doubly  Special 

Relativity  theory  based  on  the  generalization  of  the  κ-deformation  of  the  Poincaré 

algebra  acting  along  one  of  the  null  directions.  They  (We)  recall  the  quantum  Hopf 

structure  of  such  deformed  Poincaré  algebra  and  use  it  to  derive  the  phase  space 

commutation  relations.  As  in  the  DSR  based  on  the  standard  quantum  κ-Poincaré 

algebra they (we) find that the space time is non-commutative. They (We) investigate the 

fate  of  the  properties  of  Special  Relativity  in  the  null  basis:  the  split  of  the  algebra  of 

Lorentz  and  momentum  generators  into  kinematical  and  dynamical  parts,  the  action  of 

the kinematical boost M+-, and the emergence of the two dimensional Galilean symmetry 

This is partly based upon an idea raised by G. Amelino-Camelia 5,6in the general 

literature about doubly special relativity, and it is likely that deformations in a perceived 

light  cone  could  lead  to  non  symmetric  gravity  wave  generation  from  a  numerical 

simulation of two black holes in the configuration outlined above. In any case, this could 

in its own way serve as an investigation of if or not purported subtle violations of Lorentz 

transformations  indeed  have  a  relativistic  signature  which  can  be  investigated 

 

- 6 - 

 

experimentally  and  numerically  in  numerical  simulations  of  gravitational  wave  physics 

involving spin coupling between two black holes. Purported tests of the Doubly special 

relativity idea have been exceedingly difficult so far7 and this has implications as to loop 

quantum gravity and string theory which could serve as a falsifiable basis of determining 

if these theories do as they purport to do in extreme limits of the space time continuum as 

we know it.  

CONCLUSIONS 

Numerous  allegations  as  to  investigations  as  to  the  structure  of  space  time  have 

been  proposed  to  test  if  or  not  doubly  special  relativity  holds  water.  One  of  the  more 

recent has been by J. Kowalski-Glikman8, The question so raised above would be a more 

phenomenon  oriented  way  of  ascertaining  if  or  not  experimental  tests  of  Lorentz 

violations so purported can be extended to black hole simulation physics. In particular, 

as  well,  we  should  note  G.  Amelino-Camelia6  has  written  extensively  on  these 

concerning purported minimum length ideas, 

Physically realistic black hole simulations, and investigations as to deformation of 

light  cones  as  to  subtle  interactions  as  proposed  above  could  lead  to  falsifiable 

predictions and answers as to the exotic geometries proposed by string theorists and loop 

quantum gravity experts do as they purport to do, and allow for additional investigations 

of  early  universe  models,  once  we  know  the  limits  of  applicability  of  string  theory  and 

loop  quantum  gravity  to  cosmology  today.  This  would  round  out  ideas  already  in  the 

literature presented by numerous authors who have suggested that space time metrics be 

investigated directly as a proving ground for falsifiable conclusions of the Doubly Special 

relativity idea.

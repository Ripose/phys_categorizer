1. Introduction 

This  paper  describes  the  isothermal  die  swell  using  our  recent  quasi-1D  model  for  fast  (high  Deborah 
number) contraction flows of polymers melts. Because the model analyzes the flow in several flow regions 
as one continuous process, it makes possible to evaluate the die swell as a qusi-1D extrudate flow in dies of 
various  lengths.  Using  the  asymptotic  matching  condition  for  the  change  in  flow  type  at  the  die  exit 
allowed  us  to  find  the  swelling  profile  for  extrudate  along  the  flow  direction.  The  calculations  in  paper 
performed using a multi-mode viscoelastic constitutive equation of differential type, are compared with the 
experimental/direct  numerical  data  including  basic  rheological  tests.  The  presented  swelling  model 
involves no fitting parameter and is applicable for calculations using any viscoelastic constitutive equation. 

Key words: Die swelling, Contraction flow model; Deborah number 

The  die  swell  (or  extrudate  swell,  or  Barrus  Effect)  occurs  when  a  polymer  liquid, 

discharged  from  die/channel,  experiences  a  free  surface  flow.  The  swell  is  commonly 

observed in many polymer processing operations, such as capillary/slit type process, fiber 

spinning,  extrusion,  etc.  It  originates  from  elastic  nature  of  polymer  fluids  and  is 

qualitatively  explained  as  the  release  of  liquid  elastic  energy  stored  in  die  flow,  after  a 

rapid restructuring the flow type at the die exit. Usually the swell is characterized by the 

measurable parameter B presented the ratio of cross sectional areas of extrudate to the die. 

 

It  is  well  known  that  the  swell  might  be  derived  from  known  (nonlinear) 

deformation history of polymeric liquids under certain geometrical/operation conditions. 

The  knowledge  of  this  history  is  especially  important  when  the  flow  Deborah  number 

(De) and the contraction ratio in contraction flow are very high, and the die is relatively

short. In this case, the flow in the die is not developed and extrudate keeps the memory of 

early  deformation  at  the  entrance  region.  Therefore  the  common  assumption  of  the 

polymer flow as developed near the die exit, employed in many theoretical/computational 

papers,  is  invalid  and  swelling  has  to  be  analyzed  using  continuous  computations  of 

reservoir/channel viscoelastic flows. 

Various  theoretical  approaches  have  been  developed  for  evaluation  of  the  swell 

ratio.  Early  Bagley  et  al  [ 1 ]  assumed  that  the  swelling  results  from  the  geometry-

influenced  “memory  effect”. They empirically expressed the equilibrium swell ratio via 

shear  strain  and  die  geometry.  Later  Bagley  and  Duffey  [ 2]  improved  the  previous 

approach [1] including into consideration the Mooney energy function. Similar to Lodge 

[3],  Tanner  [ 4]  treated  the  swelling  as  a  process  of  recovering  elastic  energy  after 

removing  shearing.  Using  force  balance  in  the  swollen  state  and  K-BKZ  constitutive 

equation,  he  expressed  the  equilibrium  swelling  ratio  as  a  function  of  the  first  normal 

stress difference and shear strain ratio for polymer flow in a tube of infinite length. The 

text  [5]  and  paper  [6]  involved  the  Tanner  approach  in  their  empirical  formulations  to 

analyze geometrical effects.  

More  recently,  Garcia-Region  et  al  [7,8]  measured  swelling  ratio  depending  on 

distance/time  from  exiting  die.  Leonov  and  Prokunin  [9]  measured  this  ratio  for  a  PIB 

and  analyzed  it  theoretically,  using  the  assumption  of  developed  flow  in  the  die.  Using 

the force balance and equalizing the elastic  energy  flux between the die  shear flow and 

the extrudate free jet, they calculated the increase in swell with growing distance from the 

die. Their theoretical predictions overestimated, however, the experimental data. Choi et 

al  [ 10]  discussed  the  stability  and  flexibility  of  their  method  of  swell  calculations, 

employing Leonov multi-mode constitutive equation and using the Tanner method [4] for 

evaluating  the  instant  component  of  swell  for  steady  viscoelastic  flow  in  a  die. 

Nevertheless, the calculations of [10] overestimated the experimental data [9]. A possible 

reason  for  those  disagreements  is  incomplete  material  characterization.  We  will  revisit 

the  problem  below  to  improve  the  results  of  calculations  using  our  scheme  with  more 

precise evaluation of material parameters. 

Computational stability was a big problem at early stage of direct computations. 

Crochet  and  Keunings  [11]  demonstrated  the  instability  of  a  numerical  algorithm  in 

solving the die swell problem for large De number flow. Using upper convected Maxwell 

model,  they  could  obtain  the  results  only  when  De  ~ 1≤

.  Later  they  increased  their 

computational capability using Oldroyd B [12] and KBKZ [13] constitutive models. Bush 

et al [14] related the computational instability at high De number extrudate flows to the 

formulation of viscoelastic constitutive equations (CE’s)  and concluded that the reason 

of failure of direct computations came not only from the flaw of numerical algorithm but 

also  from  the  instability  of  used  CE’s.  They  found  that  MPTT  and  modified  Leonov 

models  are  capable  to  describe  high  De  number  flows  while  agreeing  well  with 

experimental  data.  Also  Wesson  et  al  [15]  independently  tested  two  different  types  of 

CE’s in their numerical study concerning the instability of CE’s. All above findings have 

been recently confirmed within the general theory of CE stability [16].  

Another  problem  of  direct  numerical  analysis  of  swell  in  flows  of  viscoelastic 

liquids is exhaustive computing time. To avoid this, an alternative numerical procedures 

were  elaborated  that  tried  using  stream  function  [17,18,19,20 and 21].  Some  of  the 

authors [18] pointed out that the extrudate flow is not the major computational problem 

but the restructuring  flow in the  die  is. Since they  considered  the  contraction flow  as a 

complex flow with interaction between the shear and extension, they select the Wagner 

integral type model as a proper CE that has been widely tested in dynamic shearing and 

extension  experiments.  Employing  Protean  coordinate  system  and  uncertain  damping 

function  with  fitting  parameters  at  the  tapered  transient  entrance  region,  they  extended 

the computational results for the extrudate swell and melt spinning for De number over 

1000.  

Recently  the  importance  of  extension  in  the  die  entrance  flow  and  swelling  has 

been recognized in many publications and handled in various ways. However, for the best 

of  our  knowledge,  just  few  attempts  have  been  made  treating  the  whole  flow  region  as 

one continuous process. In this paper we extend our contraction flow model [22] for the 

high De number flows in short dies. We do not assume here the existence of developed 

flow in the die and make modeling predictions of swell as continuous calculations of fast 

contraction flow of polymer melts in the whole flow region. In addition, we will test the 

descriptive ability of chosen stable CE on existing basic experimental data. A remarkable 

feature of our 1D contraction/swelling model is that it describes high De number flows of 

polymers without using any adjustable parameter.  

 

 

2. Constitutive Equation 

We employ in this paper a multi-mode viscoelastic CE of differential type which 

is briefly discussed below (for more details see Refs.[23-25]). This CE has been used in 

our paper [22] for simplified calculations of contraction flow.  

For each relaxation mode with relaxation time 

kθ  and elastic modulus 

kG , the CE 

operates with a modal elastic Finger tensor

2. Preliminary Analysis on Channel Flow: Quasi-1D Model of Contraction Flow 

The  entire  contraction  flow  is  analyzed  below  using  our  recent  quasi-1D  model 

[22]. We now briefly discuss this model.  

When  the  reservoir  is  long  enough,  polymer  melts  demonstrate  a  developed 

steady  shearing  (“far  field”)  entrance  flow  in  the  reservoir  pre-entrance  region  (i). 

Additionally, there is a reservoir entrance region (ii) near the die entrance where the main 

stream  converges  to  the  die  (“near  field  entrance  flow).  This  flow  sometimes  is 

accompanied  by  weak  entrance  vortices  at  the  flow  periphery  near  the  entrance  corner. 

When 1x be  the  axial  coordinate  directed  downstream  along  the  symmetry  axis  with  the 

origin ( 1

x = ) at the die orifice, the far and near field flows are located in the respective 

0

axial  domains

l< −  for  the  region  (i)  and 

)

(0

>

> −  for  the  region  (ii);  the 

)

l

x
1

coordinate,  1x

l= − ,  being  the  parameter  searched  for.  Although  the  change  of  the  flow 

characters  from  the  far  field  to  the  near  field  entrance  flow  needs  a  small  transitional 

axial  length  δ (<<l),  we  asymptotically  use  in  this  model  the  value 

1x

l= −  as  the 

boundary where sudden change in flow type happens. 

The contraction flow in the near field entrance region (ii) is initially analyzed as 

an  inhomogeneous  extensional  (or  “jet”)  flow  that  commonly  occurs  either  in  polymer 

fiber  spinning  or  in  polymer  sheet  processing  operations.  It  is  assumed  that  such  an 

approach is approximately valid when De number of flow is high enough. However, for 

relatively  low  De  number  flows,  the  simple  jet  model  has  been  complemented  with 

analysis  of  secondary  circulatory  flows  in  the  corners,  which  produce  additional  drag 

acting on primary jet.  

Two types of reservoir geometries are analyzed in Ref.[22] and in this paper: the 

slit  type  reservoir  (Fig.1a)  with  cross-sectional  sizes 

R2L (thickness)  and  LW  (width) 

L
where  R

L<<

, and the reservoir of circular geometry with the reservoir radius 

RR . To 

avoid  unnecessary  duplications  and  simplify  notations,  a  brief  description  of 

simultaneous analysis of flows in both types of geometries [22] is presented below, with 

asterisked formulae attributed to the circular geometry. The same notations

2.2.1. Jet Flow Model 

In  the  slit  die,  the  jet  flow  is  presented  as  an  inhomogeneous  planar  elongation 

flow, and in the circular die as an inhomogeneous simple elongation. Then, in both cases 

the  modal  evolution  equations  are  expressed  using  convective  approximation  for  time

3. Modeling of Isothermal Die Swelling Flow  

As  discussed  earlier,  the  elastic  energy  stored  in  the  die  flow  of  polymer  melts 

depends  on  viscoelastic  characteristics  of  polymer  melts  and  complete  flow  conditions. 

Therefore the swelling after flow in short dies has to be analyzed as continuous process 

that takes into account all the aspects of previous flow. The modal elastic Finger tensors 

for the channel flow of a viscoelastic liquid have been determined from our recent work 

on 1D quasi-state model for isothermal contraction and die flow [22]. So we will treat the 

modal elastic Finger tensors

c  at die exit as known parameters. 
k

When  a  polymer  melt  exits  the  die,  the  shear  flow  of  the  polymer  in  the  die 

changes for the extrudate flow of a inhomogeneously uniaxial elongation type. Because 

the  restructuring  zone  at  the  end  of  the  die  is  small  enough,  this  flow  restructuring  is 

approximated as in [22] as a sudden change that keeps constant the energy flux, averaged 

over  cross-section  of  the  die.  Because  of  similarity  of  this  matching  condition  to  that 

described  by  Eq.(13)  that  has  been  discussed  before  for  1D  quasi-steady  model  for 

contraction  flow,  we  would  hold  the  same  matching  condition  here.  Nevertheless,  we 

should also take into account the instant component of free swell exiting the die, which 

did not happen in the situation described by Eq.(13). In order to manage this complicated 

situation,  we  introduce  a  two-step  approach  to  transformation  of  die  shearing  flow  into 

extrudate flow: (i) the transformation of shear to the elongation flow at the very end of 

the  die, 

x

L

L−

,

and  (ii)  instant  strain  recovery  at  the  die  outlet,  1
x

= + ≡

L

.  

Once again, we simplify the time derivative to the convective derivative in our quasi-1D 

model. 

 

3.1. Extrudate swelling:

Unlike planar flow type in the slit entrance region, the flow extruded from slit channel is 

a  type  of  uniaxial  extensional  flow.  Therefore  the  same  formulae  for  elastic  strain 

tensors sh

cases of swelling after polymer flow in circular or slit die. These formulae are:

It has been discussed in the beginning of the Section 3 and the detail derivation is 

given  in  Refs.  [22,25].  We  now  consider  the  first  step  of  effective  transformation  of 

shearing die flow to the elongational one at the cross-section  L− located near the exit but 

still  in  the  die.  In  this  case,  matching  condition  described  by  Eq.(13)  is  applicable.  

Applying Eq.(13) to match the different flow types at the die exit, we can find  the values

3.3 Instant elastic recovery. 

As mentioned, an instant swell of extrudate happens just after the  flow exits the 

die,  and  the  swell  further  increases  with  the  increase  in  traveling  distance.  In  order  to 

account these step variations, we calculation, we remind that  L± are related to  1

In the cross-section  1x

The first relation in (32) is the definition of instant (elastic) recovery stretch 

sλ , which is 

independent from the modal values of elastic stretches. The second relation in (32) is the 

relation for the step-wise variation for instant recovery, which also formally follows from 

Eq.(27)  after  integrating  it  for  the  step-variation  to  obtain  

−

k

A

,  with  the 

following use of the first relation in (32). The last relation in (32) simply reflects the fact 

that after instant recovery, the elongational force 

0F is given for the extended extrudate or 

absent for the free swelling extrudate at the cross section 1x

L+=

. The third relation in (32

) serves for finding the step recovery stretch sλ , the second relation for finding the initial 

cross  section  A+ of  the  extrudate  after  instant  recovery,  and  the  first  relation  serves  for 

finding initial value of elastic stretches

kλ+ . 

 

 

 

 

As  shown  in  (29),  the  values 

and 

A

problem (27), (28). 

3.4. Numerical procedures 

They  start  with  solving  Eqs.(30)  and  (30*)  for 

kλ−  using  trapezoidal  integration 

and the root  finding subroutine.  Another root finding subroutine  was applied  to solving 

the last equation in (32) to determine the value of instant elastic recovery stretch 

sλ and 

then find the values of 

kλ+  and A+. 

For  solving  Eqs.  (27)  and  (28),  they  were  numerically  reformulated  in  explicit 

way using forward difference method and the unknown values of 

kλ and the area A were 
found  using  root  finding  subroutine.  Since  the  swelling  ratio  growing  is  critical  at  the 

initial stage, we used the composite grids scheme to axial direction assigning more dense 

meshes at the early stage. The growing length in specific direction is calculated from the 

calculations of extrudate area A via Eqs(27) and (28). 

4. Results and discussions 

All calculations were made under isothermal condition with given flow rates. The 

calculations were exemplified using various polymers: polyisobutylene P20 [9], LLDPE 

[19] (FN1010 by ATOCHEM, MW=120,000g/mol and polydispersity index equal to 6.3 
at  160oC  0.76  g/cm3)  for  circular  geometry  and  polyisobutylene  Vistanex  produced  by 

Exxon  [26]  for  the  slit  geometry.  The  Maxwell  modes  (discrete  relaxation  spectra)  for 

LLDPE  and  Vistanex  were  taken  from  the  literature  data.  It  was  confirmed  that  these 

modes could satisfactorily describe the experiments and/or direct calculations. Since even 

simple  shear  data  for  PIB  20  were  only  roughly  theoretically  described  in  [9],  we 

assumed  that  the  deviation  of  calculations  from  experiments  in  description  of  swelling 

data  could  result  from  incomplete  characterization  of  relaxation  spectra.  Therefore 

instead  of  using  original  Maxwell  modes  of  P20  from  [9],  we  found  them  anew  to  fit 

better  the  steady  simple  shearing  experimental  data  in  [9],  disregarding  possible  ill-

posedness. We also tried to improve this procedure with mode refining.  

Table 1 shows the values of numerical material parameter  n and specification of 

dimensionless function  b in CE’s (1) and (2). It should mentioned that LDPE and LLDPE 

melts  with  long  side  chains  show  quite  anomalous  behavior  in  the  extensional 

experiments  possible  due  to  the  hardening  effects  [24],  whereas  they  demonstrate  a 

common behavior in the  simple shearing.  Moreover,  LDPE/LLDPE melts exhibit much 

lower values of extensional viscosity in the repeated extension after relaxation of the first 

one.  This  might  be  attributed  to  mechano-degradation.  Recently  Ref.  [27] reported  that 

the predictions  of  LDPE/LLDPE shear  and  extensional flows were  successful  using the 

specification of the function b shown in Table 1.  

Table  2  shows  the  modified  Maxwell  modes  for  PIB-20  that  we  used  in  our 

calculations,  as  compared  to  the  original  modes  (in  bracket)  found  in  [9].  Fig.1-A 

demonstrates  the  comparison  of  constitutive  modeling  with  simple  shear  experimental 

data.  

Figure  1-B  compares  our  calculations  and  experiments  [9]  for  free  swelling 

development vs. the distance from the die. In computation of swelling for P-20, the exit 

flow is assumed to be developed because the original paper [9] did not provide necessary 

experimental  geometry  features.  Based  on  the  facts  that  the  experiments  in  [9]  were 

performed at L/2RD ratio 20 and the De number (

=

4 /
Q Rπ θ

⋅

) ranged 5~35, we expect 

3
D

our  assumption  of  developed  shear  flow  at  the  die  exit  to  be  close  enough  to  the  real 

experimental  situations.  We  also  should  mention  that  the  experiments  were  carried  out 

under given pressure drop (wall shear stress). Therefore the flow rate was found from the 

flow curve (Fig. 1-A) for the given wall shear stress and then the swelling was computed 

using  our  scheme  of  calculations.  One  can  see  that  with  the  use  of  redefined  Maxwell 

modes,  the  results  of  calculation  agree  much  better  wit  experiments.  Also,  calculated 

instant elastic recovery, which is not indicated in Ref. [9], is similar to Ref. [10]. 

Figure  2  presents  our  computational  predictions  of  PIB  Vistanex  [26]  free 

swelling  for  various  die  lengths  and  given  flow  rates.  Unfortunately,  there  are  no 

literature  experimental  data  for  making  comparisons.  As  demonstration  purpose  to 

continue  our  previous  paper,  the  computation  results  include  for  the  swelling  on  the 

various  die  lengths.  The  detail  experimental  conditions  and  material  characteristics  are 

shown in Table 3, and the calculations in Fig.2 are performed for the die lengths having 0 

(1), L/20 (2), L/10 (3), L/2 (4) and L (5) (where L=2.55cm). Since there is no significant 

elastic  energy  stored  in  the  reservoir  entrance  region  for  low  flow  rates,  the  reservoir 

deformation effects dissipate quickly in the die entrance region. The first two plots in Fig. 

2, which have De numbers (

De Q L L θ
3 / 2 W D

=

⋅

2

) equal to 8 for Fig2-A and 19 for Fig.2-

B.  Therefore  except  direct  discharging  case,  the  free  swelling  profiles  are  not  well 

resolved, even if the  flows exited die before they start to be developed. In faster flows, 

more elastic energy accumulates, so it results in more instant elastic recovery and in more 

swelling ratio. In these cases, the die length plays important role on the exit flow profile. 

When the die length is long enough, the flow is closed to be developed therefore keeps 

little  memory  of  entrance  deformation.  On  the  contrary,  when  the  die  length  is  short 

enough, the die shear flow contain the memory of entrance effects that not dissipate with 

shortening die length. Therefore, the extrudate swell profiles after flow in short dies are 

well distinguished from that after developed flows in long dies. It is well indicated in last 

two plots in Fig. 2-C and 2-D, whose De numbers are equal to 57 and 104 respectively. 

The  results  using  very  short  dies  (i.e.  0,  L/20  and  L/10)  are  found  well  separated  from 

these calculated for relatively long dies (L/2 and L) for given flow rates. Obviously the 

calculated  swelling  profiles  larger  swelling  ratio  and  longer  developing  distance  at  the 

higher De number and for shorter dies. 

There  is  another  experimental  data  for  high  De  number  free  extrudate  swelling 

after flow in short dies. These data were obtained in Ref.[19] for LLDPE. RMS 800 and 

elongation  rheometer  of  rate  controlled  type  were  used  in  [19]  for  basic  rheological 

measurements.  Instron  ICR3211  with  electro-optical  device  (Zimmer  OGH)  was 

employed for swelling measurements. The details experimental setup for swelling test are 

presented in Table 4. 

Figure  3  demonstrates  the  comparisons  of  CE  (1)  and  (2)  predictions  with  the 

basic  rheological  data.  Using  the  dimensionless  parameters  and  the  Maxwell  modes  in 

Table 1 and 4, the simple shear (Fig.3-A), dynamic (Fig.3-B), elongation (Fig.3-C) and 

start-up (Fig.3-D) flow computations agree well with the experimental data.  

Figure 4 shows the comparison the measured and calculated longitudinal velocity 

profiles  in  free  swelling  extrudate  flow  found  from  the  cross-sectional  area  ratios,

. The swelling computations were performed using the data in Table 4. Instead 

of  applying  uncertain  damping  function  that  used  to  evaluate  tapered  entrance 

deformation with fitting parameters in Ref. [19], we used in our computation the quasi-

1D model of  contraction flow (the  jet  approach  with  secondary corner flow) neglecting 

shear  deformation  at  tapered  entrance.  The  computations  in  Fig.  4-A  were  performed 

with  De  (

)  number  about  40  at  the  flow  rate  Q=  7.125e-10  m3/s  with 

L/2RD=19.23  (Die  1  in  Table  4).  It  is  seen  that  the  instant  elastic  recovery  and  the 

equilibrium  cross-sectional  area,  obtained  from  the  relation

→ ∞ ,  respectively,  are  smaller  than  those  in  Fig.  4-B.  This  is  because 

the computations for Fig.4-A showed that the die flow there is close to the developed one. 
On  the  contrary  data  in  Fig.  4-B  whose  De=  1300  at  flow  rate  Q=2.375e-8  m3/s  for 

L/2RD=0.96 (Die2 in Table4) showed that the die flow was not developed. Therefore in 

this case the calculations here were performed using our contraction/die flow model using 

the data in Table 4. Since the literature data did not provide the measurements in the die 

flow developing region, the possible tapered entrance effect on the developing flow could 

not been confirmed. This effect may generate additional shear deformation and affect the 

flow profiles. Nevertheless the both swelling experiments are successfully described with 

the jet-drag  entrance model  while all basic  rheological  data  are  well  described  with the 

chosen CE (1-2). 

 

5. Conclusions 

This paper analyzed the short die effect on swelling. Although there are plenty of 

published  data  for  the  die  swelling  of  polymer  fluids,  they  do  not  provide  necessary 

information for comparison. Firstly the information of rheological characterization of the 

polymer  melt  needs  to  be  provided  which  makes  possible  to  evaluate  the  discrete 

relaxation  spectrum  {

kG θ .  Secondly  the  precise  description  of  the  geometry  and 

}

,

k

measurements should be available. Additionally, polymer melts are more suitable for our 

modeling  than  polymer  solutions.  Although  there  is  no  problem  to  describe  a  polymer 

solution by  a certain  CE,  it  is hard  to  generate high  enough De number,  when our 1-D 

contraction  flow  model  works  well.  Even  if  generating  high  De  number  flow  is 

experimentally  possible,  the  inertia  effects  of  polymer  solution  (Reynolds  number 

effects) are not negligible. Therefore we found from the literature only the presented here 

data that not enough to compare our model calculations to the direct calculations and/or 

experimental data. 

Nevertheless, our 1-D contraction flow model which calculates the polymer flows 

in dies of  arbitrary length  taking into  account  highly nonlinear viscoelastic  phenomena, 

allows  us  to  consistently  analyze  the  polymer  flows  in  the  whole  flow  region  as  one 

continuous  process,  involving  no  fitting  parameters.  We  also  demonstrated  that  our 

computationally  low  cost  model  works  well  at  high  enough  De  numbers,  yet  being 

applicable  to  other  CE’s.  We  also  expect  it  to  work  well  for  the  more  complicated 

polymer flows, including non-symmetric flows, with relatively easy computations. 

In  our  research,  the  isothermal  fast  complex  flow  with  was  considered.  Even 

though  the  results  seem  to  be  satisfactory  for  the  tested  cases,  there  is  still  one  more 

additional important factor that we need to take into  account. This is  the  effect of non-

isothermality with very high dissipative heat generation that plays very important role in 

high-speed (high De number) polymer processing operations. The extension of our quasi-

1D  flow  model  on  analysis  non-isothermal  regimes  of  polymer  flows  will  be  reported 

elsewhere.

A simple electrodynamic model for describing the behavior of a skeletal matter composed of 
magnetized, electrically conducting thin rods (1D magnetic dipoles) is proposed. It is aimed at 
modeling  the  self-assembling  of  a  skeletal  matter  from  carbon  nanotubes  (or  similar 
nanodust),  as  suggested  in  [1]  for  interpreting  the  experimental  data  on  the  long-lived 
filamentary structures in the high-current electric discharges. Here the capability of the model 
is illustrated with the example of how a straight tubular skeleton, which is composed of ~300 
dipoles and carry circular electric current in its wall, may be wrapped up by a distant pulsed 
electric current to make a toroid-like structure.  
 
1. Introduction  
 
The  self-similar  skeletal  structures  [1,2],  composed  of  tubular  blocks  (sometimes  with  the 
cartwheel  in  the  butt-end  of  the  tubule)  which  repeat  themselves  successively  at  various 
length scales to give, correspondingly, a fractal of particular topology of constituent blocks, 
were  called  the  Universal  Skeletal  Structures  (USS)  [3].  The  phenomenon  of  USS  was 
suggested in [1] for interpreting the experimental data on the long-lived filamentary structures 
in the high-current electric discharges. The USS phenomenon was predicted and traced in the 
very  wide  range  of  length  scales,  10-5  cm  -  1023  cm,  in  the  data  from  various  laboratory 
experiments and observations of severe weather phenomena and astrophysical objects [2] (for 
the current status of the USS project and its popular description see, respectively, [4,5] and 
[3]).  
 
The smallest block of USS was suggested [1] to be the widely known object, namely carbon 
nanotube,  or  similar  nanostructures  with  participation  of  other  chemical  elements.  The 
prediction  [1]  was  based  on  appealing  to  exceptional  electrodynamic  properties  of  their 
hypothetical building blocks -- first of all, the ability of these blocks to facilitate the electric 
breakdown in laboratory discharges and to assemble the micro- and macroskeletons. The self-
assembling of skeletons was suggested to be based dominantly on magnetic phenomena. The 
indications  on  plausibility  of  the  anomalous  magnetism  and,  in  particular,  on  the  ability  of 
CNTs, and/or their assemblies, to trap and almost dissipationlessly hold magnetic flux, with 
the specific magnetization high enough to stick the CNTs together, come from observations of 
superconductor-like  diamagnetism  in  the  assemblies  of  CNTs  at  high  enough  temperatures. 
Such evidences are obtained for the self-assemblies of CNTs (which contain, in particular, the 
ring-shaped structures of few tens of microns in diameter) inside non-processed fragments of 
cathode deposits, at room temperatures, [6] and for the artificial assemblies, at 400 K [7]. The 
evidences and arguments for the room-temperature superconductivity in individual CNT, and 
in  artificial  and  natural  assemblies  of  CNTs,  are  summarized  in  [8].  The  recent  survey  of 
experimental  evidences  for,  and  theoretical models of, the unexpected magnetism of carbon 
foams and heterostructured nanotubes is given in [9].  
 
Despite  the  above  experimental  evidences  and  theoretical  models  need  much  stronger  tests 
and  confirmations,  they  justify  explicit  demonstration  of  the  capability  of  magnetized 

nanotubular  blocks  to  self-assemble  a  tubule  of  higher  generation  [1(B,C)]  and  sustain  the 
integrity of the assembled skeleton. Similarly to development of, e.g., the plasma theory, now 
it is worth to start with analysing the stability of skeletal matter within the frame of as simple 
model  as  possible.  This  implies  an  analysis  of  the  capability  of  nanotubes  to  sustain  the 
integrity  of  the  hypothetically  formed  tubular  skeleton,  which  is  composed  of  magnetized 
nanotubes (i.e. analyse the viability of the tubule of the 2-nd generation).  
 
In the present paper, we (i) formulate a simple model for describing the behavior of a skeletal 
matter  composed  of  magnetized,  electrically  conducting  thin  rods  which  behave  as  the  1D 
magnetic  dipoles,  and  (ii)  illustrate  the  capability  of  the  model  on  the  example  of  how  a 
straight  tubular  skeleton,  which  is  composed  of  ~300  dipoles  and  carry  circular  electric 
current in its wall, may be wrapped up by a distant pulsed electric current to make a toroid-
like structure.  
 
2. Simple model of skeletal matter, composed of 1D magnetic dipoles  
 
We treat the problem in as simple picture as possible. Thus, we assume the elementary block 
of the skeletons to possess the following electrodynamic properties: 

• 

• 

• 

the  1D  static  magnetic  dipole  (such  a  dipole  may  be  represented  as  a  couple  of 
magnetic monopoles located on the tips of the rigid-body dipole; this approximation 
seems to be good for the tubules and/or rod with the large length-to-diameter ratio),  
static positive electric charge, which is located in the center of the rod and is screened 
by the ambient electrons at some Debye radius (electric charging is due to inevitable 
field emission, at least thermal one, by the nanotubes),  
static electrical conductivity, which is high enough to enable the tubular skeleton to 
trap,  without  dissipation,  the  magnetic  flux  inside  the  tubule  (i.e.  sustain  circular 
electric currents in the tubule’s wall).     

 
The  above  characteristics  enable  us  to  describe  the  following  interactions  of  elementary 
blocks: 

•  mutual  magnetic  attraction  and  repulsion  of  the  dipoles  (i.e.  interaction  of  circular 
electric  current  in  the  wall  of  one  elementary  block  with  similar  current  in  another 
elementary block), 

•  action  of  external  magnetic  field  on  the  magnetic  dipole  (i.e.  interaction  of  circular 
electric currents in the walls of the elementary block with the external electric current 
producing the magnetic field), 
screened electric repulsion of elementary blocks, 

• 
•  action  of  magnetic  field,  produced  by  the  longitudinal  electric  current  in  all  the 
magnetic dipoles, on the given dipole (i.e. interaction of circular electric current in the 
walls  of  the  elementary  block  with  the  longitudinal  electric  current  in  the  walls  of 
other blocks), 
interaction of longitudinal electric current in the walls of the blocks.  

• 

 
To  simplify  the  description  of  dynamics  of  solid  bodies  we  consider  each  dipole  to  be  a 
couple of the point objects (coordinates ri , masses mi, i=1,2) which are linked together with a 
rigid-body massless bond and subjected to the action of the external forces applied to these 
objects, F1 and F2, and to the center of mass of the system (i.e. to the massless interconnecting 
bond), Fcm. The exact system of equations for such a system is described by the conventional 

equations for the motion of a solid body specified for the above particular case. The equations 
for the momentum and angular momentum, respectively, of the solid body are as follows:

The electrodynamic forces are assumed to largely exceed the gravity of the dipoles. 
 
To  describe  sticking  of  the  dipoles  we  allow  the  magnetic  monopoles  to  move  freely  in  an 
isotropic  potential  well  which  is  formed  by  (a)  magnetic  attraction  of  monopoles  of  the 
opposite sign and (b) their repulsion due to elasticity of the tips of the tubules/rods of finite 
diameter.  The  form  of  the  potential  and  the  respective  force  are  shown  in  Figure  1.  This 
potential  provides  smooth  transition  from  the  Coulomb  potential  for  r>r*  to  repulsion 
potential at small radii. Also, in the region r<r* we introduced the following friction force:

where 
 
The  above  strong  simplification  of  the  original  picture  of  the  motion  of  solid  rods  is 
acceptable if the spatial density of the rods is rather small and, respectively, the sticking and 
collisions of the rods are governed mostly by the interaction of strong magnetic monopoles on 
the tips of these rods.  
 
3. Dynamics of tubular skeleton, composed of 1D magnetic dipoles  
 
Here we illustrate the capability of the model, outlined in the previous Section, to describe the 
integrity of skeleton under the action of external forces. First, we construct the ideal tubular 
skeleton  according  to  the  rules  suggested  in  [1(B,C)]:  namely,  the  skeleton  is  composed  of 
hexagons  assembled  from  the  dipoles.  The  structure  of  the  tubular  straight  skeleton,  whose 
wall is assembled from hexagons and whose cross section has also a hexagonal structure, is 
shown  in  Figs.  2  and  3,  for  the  total  number  of  the  dipoles  Ndip  =  294.  The  corresponding 
magnetic threading of such a network will be ideal if the skeleton is composed of the dipoles 
of  magnetic  charges  ZM  which  differ  by  the  factor  of  2.  In  general  case,  it  is  possible  to 
compose a skeleton from arbitrary polygons provided the magnetic charges on the tips of the 
blocks support the respective magnetic threading.  
 

The dynamics of the skeleton in Figs. 2,3 is tested against the perturbation introduced by the 
distant external electric current for the following conditions,:  

screening (Debye) radius rD=1,  

•  magnetic charges ZM=2, for red thick blocks, and ZM=2, for all the others,  
•  electric charges Z =1 for all the blocks,  
• 
•  brake coefficient  kbr=100, 
•  current-current force coefficient F0JJ=2,  
•  current-external-current force coefficient FJext=50,  
•  external electric current flows along X-direction, the line of current is located in the 

point {Y=-15, Z=15} and acts from time t=0 to t=1.  

 
The results of numerical modeling are shown in Figures 4-7 for various time moments. The 
future  dynamics  of  the  skeleton  --  collision  of  the  tips  of  the  skeleton,  which  follows  the 
“closure” of the loop, as is seen in Figure 7 -- may not be described by the model of Sec. 2 
because we neglected mechanical collision of the rods along entire length of the blocks.  
 
The results of Figs. 4-7 may be interpreted as an illustration of the possibility of skeletons -- if 
formed in the high-current electric discharges or similar conditions - to form the torodal-like 
and  cartwheel-like  structures  (cf.  laser-induced  production  of  large  carbon-based  toroids 
reported in [10], see the Q-shaped toroids in Fig. 3 of this paper).

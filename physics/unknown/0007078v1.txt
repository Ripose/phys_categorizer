1. Abstract

The symmetry of the problem of the apparent deficit in upward-going atmospheric

muon neutrinos reveals two possible, nonexclusive kinds of solution:  Nonlinearity in
distance or nonlinearity in angle of observation.

Nonlinearity in distance leads to the most popular theory for the atmospheric

problem, neutrino flavor oscillations.  If the observed deficit is caused by oscillations and
not, say, flavor-changing or other weak-force scattering, neutrinos must be massive.  But,
if flavor oscillations occur in vacuum, all oscillating neutrinos must have exactly equal
mass.   Theories of oscillation in matter such as the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein
(MSW) effect do not work in vacuum.   This is the conceptual conflict of kinematics versus
vacuum oscillations.

Flavor-changing oscillations like those of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)

quark theory become possible in vacuum if freely propagating neutrinos may be
associated with local substructure.

Nonlinearity in angle of observation leads to a simple prediction of an excess of

horizontal muon flavor.   This and other angle-based effects should be observable at
Super-Kamiokande or other instruments which can measure atmospheric flux by flavor.

2. Atmospheric Muon-Neutrino Deficit

2.1  Linearities and Integration-Ratio Parameters

We look closely at the theoretical context in which the atmospheric deficit in upward-

going muon-neutrinos is identified, trying to understand all the relevant parameters.

2.1.1  Density Function for the Earth’s Atmosphere

A generic approach to the Earth’s atmosphere just requires integration over the volume

of a thin shell.    For example, to compute the mass M of the atmosphere, define
coordinates as in Fig. 1:

Let the Earth have an average radius of 6400 km, and

the atmosphere a density space constant of  4 km.   An
element of atmosphere located at point 
 of  ( )
be associated with a density  rd
d r
, in which
K is the average density at sea level (about 1.3  kg m3 ) .
For the mass M of the atmosphere, we then have,

2.1.2  Atmospheric Neutrino Observation Parameters

We assume as an approximation that the probability of showering of a primary cosmic
particle depends only on density of the atmosphere; the probability of a subsequent decay
then will depend on the inverse density [4*].   For any such event, there will be a flux of
neutrinos with probability of emission  PN  of a neutrino of type N,

Consider the atmosphere
of the Earth a thin shell on
a sphere.  Consider the
observed deficit the result
of comparison of  counts
against some benchmark
particle (maybe n
e ) in two
opposite solid angles a
and  b :  The two angles
may be assumed to define
two cones of observation
each with apex at Super-K,
the base of one directed
skyward for downward
events ( b , Fig. 2), the other
toward the center of the
Earth for upward events
(a , Fig. 2).   Here, a
means "up" and  b   means
"down", referring to the
observed direction of
propagation of the decay
products.

Obviously letting
b
= -
, we

a
immediately expect the
upward  F

a  and downward
b  fluxes to be equal for a

thin-shell atmosphere, because the linear extents of the thin-shell areas swept by equal
angles at Super-K always will be proportional, and the linear distances to the thin shells
always will be inversely proportional.

Nevertheless, we seek more insight into the details.   In Fig. 2, the flux  F

b  in cone  b

will be assumed given by downward decay events B inversely proportional to density  ( )
d h
of the atmosphere.  After some figuring, using orthogonal components a
2  to define
a rectangular-based pyramid approximation to the differential circular cone angle a  in
Fig. 2, and likewise for  b , we get an expression for up-down bias, assuming isotropic
scattering in the atmosphere,

We see that (2.4) represents purely a geometric ratio, again having nothing to do with

particle kinematics or detector energy sensitivity.   Taking equal observation cones
=  on a diameter of the Earth, and using the exponential atmosphere as in (2.3),
a b h=
we may evaluate (2.4) easily.   The cone angle integrals on a
1  drop out when the
angles are equal, and the  cosh  terms may be neglected in the exponential-atmosphere
density terms, allowing the second angle integrals to drop out, too.   The result,

again shows the same linearity as was evident in Fig. 2.

The only parameter missing from (2.5) is that of the scattering profile of the cosmic

particles.  To describe the forward-scattering intensity,
we may write the equation of a circle (sphere) centered
on the event H and then distort it by stretching it along
a radius  RH  of the Earth, as in Fig. 3, with the
eccentricity parameter E.   Symmetry about  RH  makes
the signs of the angles unimportant.

scattering with anisotropy E.

We obtain our result then by expressing w  in terms of

However, once again, the integration over equal cone angles would make all angle

terms drop out, and the scattering profile would make no difference.

The only relevant parameters therefore are angle of observation and distance of the

detector from the detected atmospheric scattering event.   There seems to be no way that
the ratio over equal observation angles can depart from the ratio determined by the
cosmic particle decay event probabilities  PN , for example,  P

Therefore, any theory explaining the observed deficit must postulate a nonlinearity in

observation angle or in distance.

2.2.2.2  inelastic scattering

3. Neutrino Oscillation Observations

3.1  Source - Detector Distances

3.1.1  Oscillation phase must be well defined

If just momentum or energy were conserved, we could assume one of them constant,
and let v (or u 2 ) vary inversely with mass expectancy.  But both are conserved for a free
particle, which leads to the v and u 2  paradox (below).   So, for a free particle, if m varies,
then we should assume v doesn’t.  Therefore the oscillation phase can be well defined
(within quantum uncertainty), because with v not varying much, the mass expectancy
may change accurately according to theory (calculated) distance.

Along these lines of reasoning, the more relativistic the neutrino, the more the mass
determines the kinematics, because of the Lorentz scaling of mass (but not of velocity).

4. Vacuum Oscillation Theory

4.1  Usual:  Based on Analogy to CKM

As in [8*], Chapter 7, ignoring time-evolution and viewing the problem strictly in terms

of distance x from the neutrino initial (creation) point, we write the flavor state as a
function of detector distance x in terms of the mixing matrix  tV  and the mass state (mass-
eigenstate state vector):

 We note that the mass expectancy,

supposed to cause observation of the atmospheric muon neutrino deficit as a change in
flavor expectancy according to formula (4.1.1).   Formulas for mixing as a function of
distance have been derived in terms of the mass eigenstate mass difference,

4.2  Superposition

4.2.1  Difference between Superposition and Interaction

Young-type superposition is not possible for neutrinos, which are supposed to

propagate as trios of mass eigenstates not confined to short distances.  This is because of
the small source aperture relative to propagation distance (Heisenberg).

neutrinos might be massive.

Abstract: 

 
Propagation  of  the  TE  electromagnetic  waves  in  self-focusing  medium  is  governed  by  the 
nonlinear Schrödinger equation. In this paper the stationary solutions of this equation have been 
systematically  presented.  The  phase-plane  method,  qualitative  analysis,  and  mechanical 
interpretation of the differential equations are widely used. It is well known that  TE waves can be 
guided by the single interface between two semi-infinite media, providing  that one of the media 
has a self-focusing (Kerr type) nonlinearity. This special solution is called a spatial soliton. In this 
paper  our  interests  are  not  restricted  to  the  soliton  solutions.  In  the  context  of  the  nonlinear 
substrate  and  cladding  we  have  found  solutions  which  could  be  useful  to  describe  also  the 
incident  light  in  nonlinear  medium.  This  result  is  the  main  point  of  the  paper.  Some  of  the 
presented  stationary  solutions  were  already  used  in  similar  optical  context  in  literature  but  we 
show  a  little  wider  class  of  solutions.  In  the  last  section  we  review  and  illustrate  some  results 
concerning the spatial soliton solution.

1. Introduction 

 
Propagation of light in Kerr medium has been already widely investigated in the literature. In this 
paper we focus our attention on the TE wave propagating along single interface between two Kerr 
media. Very similar problems have already been examined by many authors [1-9].  It was found  
that  TE waves can be guided by the interface between two semi-infinite media, providing  that 
one  of  the  media  has  a  self-focusing  nonlinearity.  This  is  a  special  solution  called  the  spatial 
soliton. 
In some sense our paper is a review and a extension of those papers. In our paper we assume that 
both  substrate  and  cladding  are  two  different anisotropic Kerr type nonlinear media. Moreover, 
we  do  not  want  to  restrict  ourselves  to  soliton solutions, but  to  show  a whole class of possible 
stationary solutions existing for this case. Some of the presented stationary solutions were already 
used in similar context in literature [1-9] but we will show a little wider class of solutions.  
In Fig.1 the coordinate system that will be used in this paper is defined. The interface is in the yz-
plane and propagation is along the z-axis with no dependence upon y.

Under this condition (i.e.  ∂ / ∂ y  =  0 ) the time dependent Maxwell equations fall into two 
groups: TE and TM waves, see e.g. [7] .  Here we are interested in TE waves only. We also 
assume harmonic time dependence of fields with a single angular frequency ω. Then TE waves 
are described by the set  of differential equations 

(1) 

 
iω µ0   Hz  =   ∂x Ey,            
         
iω µ0  Hx  =  − ∂z Ey,                   
 
iω ε   Ey  =   ∂x Hz  −  ∂z Hx .        

2 

We look for solutions in the form 

 
Ey (x,y,z)  = Ey (x) exp[i(kz z − ω t)],            
 
Hx (x,y,z) = Hx (x) exp[i(kz z − ω t)],             
 
Hz (x,y,z) = Hz (x) exp[i(kz z − ω t)]. 
 

Our task is to find the functions Hx (x),Hz (x),Ey (x) . Because we do not admit any dependence on 
coordinate  z,  it  means  that  we  look  for  stationary  solutions.  For  simplicity  we  will  omit  the 
coordinate x further on. Considering propagation of light along the optical axis of each medium 
we reduced the susceptibility tensor to a diagonal form as  

                                                        ε     =                ε22 

 
          ε11 

                                         ε33 
 

Since we are interested in medium of Kerr type nonlinearity we put for ε22    
 
ε22  =  ε   +  aEy2, 

 
where ε  and a are linear and nonlinear coefficients, respectively. One can easily check that 
combining equations (1), (2), (3) and (4) the nonlinear equation for field component Ey (x) is 
obtained   

d 2 Ey  / d x 2 − κ 

2 Ey  + 2λEy2 Ey   =  0, 

where we use notation 

κ 

2 =  kz

2  −  k0

2 ε ,     λ  =   ½ k0

2 a,     k0  =  ω /c. 

 For self-focusing medium the following inequalities are fulfilled  

a > 0 ,       kz

2 ε  > 0.

Equation (5) is a stationary version of the famous Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation.  
In  the  next  sections  we  briefly  discuss  its  solutions.  These  solution  are  very  well  known  for 
mathematicians but it is interesting to discuss them in this optical context. Our goal is to present a 
mechanical interpretation of the differential equations and we extentively do it here qualitatively 
[10].

2. Duffing equation 

 
In  general  the  electric  field  component  Ey    should  be  regarded  as  complex.  However,  in  this 
section we examine only real Ey. Under such an assumption the equation (5) is just the Duffing 
equation  [10]  which  is  known  in  nonlinear  mechanics  as  one  of  the  simplest  nonlinear 
generalisation of the harmonic oscillator. It is also one of the form of self-interacting scalar field 
model ϕ 4 of field theory 

d 2 Ey  / d x2  −  κ 

2 Ey   +  2 λ Ey 

3   ====  0. 

Equation (8) can be integrated at once to give the first integral 

(d Ey  / d x)2  −  κ 

2 Ey 2   +  λ Ey 4   ====  C . 

In mechanics the interpretation of the constant of integration C is obvious. It is simply the total 
energy of the nonlinear oscillator. The first term is the kinetic energy and the next two terms 
 

U  =  − κ 

2 Ey 2   +  λ Ey 4 

give the potential energy U. Contrary to a parabolic potential of harmonic oscillator the potential 
of Duffing oscillator has an additional term. In Fig.2 we present the plot of  U .

Fig. 2:     The ‘potential energy’ of Duffing oscillator (eq. (10)). 
 
Apart  from  the  potential  energy  it  is  useful  to  plot  the  ‘phase  diagram’,  i.e.,  trajectories  of  the 
Duffing equation (5) in coordinates (Ey , dEy /dx), see Fig.3. It enables us a qualitative discussion 
of solutions.

Fig. 3:      Phase diagram of Duffing equation (8). 
 
One can distinguish three different types of solutions. 
1. C < 0.  
‘Small  amplitude’  solutions  close  to  the  stable  points    ±  E0  .  They  are  inside  separatrix  curve. 
Analytically, they are described in terms of elliptic functions. We present the solutions in terms of 
Jacobi elliptic functions though Weierstrass elliptic functions can also be used  here 
 

Ey   =   [κ 2/λ (2− m2)] ½  dn { [κ 2/(2− m2)] ½ (x − x0  ), m }  
 

with the following relation between parameters m and C  

 
C  =  − (κ 4/4λ) (1 − m2) / (1 −  m2/2)2;         0 ≤  m < 1 . 
 

2. C = 0. 
Soliton solution i.e. exactly separatrix curve. Here Jacobi functions degenerate to hyperbolic ones 
  

Ey   =  ±  (κ 2/λ) ½ { 1 / ch[κ(x − x0  )] };                 m = 1 .(cid:31) 

3. C > 0.  
‘Large amplitude’ solutions given again in terms of Jacobi functions 
 

Ey   =   [κ 2/λ(2m2 − 1)] ½ m  cn { [κ 2/(2m2 − 1)] ½ (x − x0  ), m } , 
 

where the parameters m and C subject the condition 

C  =  (κ 4 m2/λ) (1− m2) / (2m2 − 1)2  ;                     (½) ½  ≤  m < 1 . 
 

                                                                          

Certainly  in  our  optical  problem,  the  interpretation  of  the  constant  C  is  quite  different  than  in 
mechanics. In particular it is not energy of the system. As we will see later, it is a constant  which 
is connected with boundary conditions.

We have already mention that in general Ey  should be considered as complex. In this section we 
examine this case and find the solutions. To our knowledge these solutions have not been 
presented in this context yet. We express Ey (x) as  

 
3. Complex case 

 
Ey (x)  =  E(x)  exp[i ϕ(x)]. 
 

Both functions E(x) and ϕ(x) are real. In this way we admit the dependence of the phase ϕ on x 
coordinate. Our first motivation to find an exact form of such a solution was to describe a wave 
which is incident at some angle onto interface. For instance, one can easily notice that equation     
(5) admits solutions in a plane wave form with any wave vector lying in xz plane. Of course  (16) 
is a generalisation of such plane waves. Inserting (16) into (5) results in a set of two equations 

 
d 2 E / d x 2  −  E (d ϕ / d x)2  −  κ 
 
E (d 2 ϕ / d x 2 )  +  2 (d ϕ / d x )(d E / dx)  ====  0 . 
 

2 E  +  2 λ E 3   ====  0, 

The second of them can be easily integrated to give 

 
d ϕ / d x  =  K / E 2,  
 

where  K  is  integration  constant.  This  constant  refers  to  energy  flux  propagating  to  or  from  the 
interface, see, e.g. [7]. 
The combination of equation (18) with the first of the equations (17) gives 

d 2 E / d x 2   −  κ 

2 E  +  2 λ E 3  −  K 2 / E 3   ====  0. 

This equation (19) differs from Duffing equation that it contains the term with the constant K . 
There is no problem to find its first integral 

(d E  / d x)2  −  κ 

2 E 2   +  λ E 4 + K 2 / E 2   ====  Cϕ . 

Thus (20) contains two integration constants K and Cϕ . 
Likewise,  as  in  pure  Duffing  equation  case,  it  is  useful  to  plot  phase  diagram  for  this  case,  in 
order to discuss the solutions qualitatively, see Fig.4.

Fig. 4:      Phase diagram of equation (19). 
 
This phase diagram has qualitatively different properties than the one in Fig.3. That is quite 
naturally explicable in nonlinear oscillator analogy, because the ‘potential energy’ is (see Fig.5) 
 

U  =  − κ 

2 E 2   +  λ E 4  +  K 2 / E 2  . 

(21) 

 

 
 

Fig. 5:     The ‘potential energy’ (21) of the equation (19). 
 
As it is easily seen in Fig.5 (K ≠ 0 !), there are always two separate potential wells. The first and 
the  most  important  conclusion  which  can  be  drawn  from  these  diagrams  is  the  lack  of  soliton 
solution. Certainly, it is because of the lack of any separatrix in the phase diagram. 
Multiplying the equation (20) by E 2 , and defining  y ≡ E 2  we can recast it to the form 
 

 
¼ (d y /d x)2   +  λ  y 3   −  κ 
 

2  y 2   −  Cϕ  y   ====  − K 2 . 

(22) 

 

7 

Once more we can use mechanical analogy and look upon equation (22) as the first integral of a 
certain nonlinear oscillator (with quadratic nonlinearity in equation of motion). Then the quantity 

 
U  =  λ  y 3   −  κ 
 

2  y 2   −  Cϕ  y, 

(23) 

plays a role of the ‘potential energy’ and the constant  − K 2  simply stands for the ‘total energy’ 
of the oscillator. Note that for  K ≠ 0  it is always negative. As before, it is useful to look at the 
diagram of ‘potential energy’ (23), see Fig.6. 
 

 

Fig. 6:     The ‘potential energy’ given by the equation (23). 
 
Keeping in mind that the diagram has the physical sense only for  y > 0  (because y ≡ E  2), one 
can easily notice that solutions could only be in the form of oscillations inside the potential well 
(the  shaded  area  in  the  diagram).  It  is  certainly  in  full  agreement  with  previous  qualitative 
analysis of the equation (20). Though the equation (22) gives nothing new at this moment, it will 
be very useful later. A simple conclusion from Fig.6 is the necessary condition for the existence 
of solutions 

λ  ymin

3   −  κ 

2  ymin

2   −  Cϕ  ymin    ≤   − K 2 , 

 

 

where  ymin  is the minimum of the potential well. It does not make any trouble to find the value of 
ymin  but since it is not of much interest we skip this here. 
The analytical solution of equation (22) is      
 

y  =  α  −  β  m2 sn2 [ µ 

(x − x0  ), m ] , 

 
where the constants α, β  are solutions of the algebraic equations 

 
λ α 3  −  κ 2 α 2   −  Cϕ α   +  K 2   =   0, 
 
β 2   −  3β α  +  3α 2   +  (κ 2 /λ) β  −  2 (κ 2 /λ) α  −  Cϕ /λ  =  0 . 
 

(24) 

(25) 

(26) 

 

8 

In addition, because y > 0  for every x , then α, β should fulfil the inequalities 

 
α  > 0        and         α  > β m2  . 
 

There is no problem to solve the set (26) algebraically in a standard way. 
Knowing α , β  one finds µ  and  m to be 

 
µ 2   =   λ β, 
m 2  =  [(3λα  −  κ2 ) /µ2] − 1 . 
 

Note  that  the  choice    α = β,  implies    K  =  0.  Then,  the  above  solution  reduces  to  the  ‘small 
amplitude’ case of Duffing equation, i.e. to the equations (11) and (12). 
So far we used mechanical analogy to examine equation (22). But this equation has its own 
meaning in optics. In fact, it determines the energy flux along the direction of propagation, i.e. the 
z component of Poynting vector Sz. 

 
Sz   =  − ½ Re (Ey Hx )   =   ½ (c2ε0 kz /ω) E 2 . 
 

Let us now  define   1/γ   ≡   ½ (c2ε0 kz /ω)  which allows the equation (22) to be written down as 
the equation for Sz , i.e., 

¼ γ 2 (d Sz  / d x)2   +  λ γ 3 Sz

 2   −  Cϕ  γ  Sz   +  K 2   =  0 . 

 
 3   −  κ 2  γ 2  Sz
 

The solution of (30) reads 

 
γ  Sz   =  α − β  m2  sn2[µ (x − x0  ), m ] . 

 
Knowing Sz,  the time-averaged power flow P along z axis in each half space can be obtained. 
It is the integral over Sz  from x = 0  (interface) to infinity or minus infinity. In general, such 
integrals diverge. It should not be considered as a disadvantage for an incident wave, because the 
conservation of energy flux in the nonlinear medium is guaranteed by the finite value of constant 
K, and we do not need the total power to be finite. On the contrary, in the case of surface or 
guided waves along interface, we expect the power P to be finite. The only possibility to make 
these integrals finite is to take  

α = β          and        m = 1 .               

It is of course the soliton solution (13) of previously examined Duffing equation. 
Thus,  for  a  single  interface  between  two  self-focused  nonlinear  media,  there  are  no  other 
stationary solutions with finite power flow than spatial solitons.

4. Solitons 

 
Solitons  are  the  most  important  and  the  most  strongly  examined  stationary  solutions  of  the 
Duffing equation. Such localized (soliton) solutions in the context of a single interface between 
two nonlinear media were described for the first time by A.G. Litvak and V.A. Mironov in 1968, 
[1]. They were extensively  discussed in many papers later, e.g. [2-9]. In this section we review 
the  formulas  describing  the  soliton  solutions.  This  simple  case  serves  here  as  an  example  of 
matching conditions on the interface. We leave the more general problem of matching conditions 
for  future  considerations.  Our  choice  gives  the  opportunity  to  present  nice  plots  of  the  soliton 
solutions. This is maybe the most interesting point of this section. 
Using equation (13) we can write the solutions in each half-space as 
  

E1   =  (κ1

2/λ1 )½   { 1 /ch[κ1 (x − x1)] }, 

 

for the first medium and  
 

E2   =  (κ2 

2/λ2 )½   { 1 /ch [κ2 (x − x2 )] }, 

 
for the second medium. Note that the maxima of  E1 , E2   are for  x1 , x2  respectively. At  x = 0, 
the boundary conditions read 

 
E1( x= 0)  =   E2( x= 0)       and       (d E1 / d x ) |x = 0   =  (d E2 / d x ) |x = 0 . 
 

It  proves  that  the  field  on  the  interface  (let  refer  to  it  as    E0  ),  depends  only  on  the  constants 
characterising  the  media  and  once  they  are  fixed,  the  field  on  the  interface  remains  fixed, 
independent of the wave number kz or the power flow along the interface. 
    

E0   =  [(κ1

2  −  κ2

2) / (λ1  − λ2 )] ½ =  [2(ε2  −  ε1)/(a1  −  a2)] ½ . 

 
Thus, for real E0 , the following conditions must be fulfilled 

 
ε2  > ε1    and   a1  > a2            or            ε2  < ε1    and   a1  < a2 . 
 

They determine the media for which a spatial soliton would exist. 
The parameters  x1 , x2  can be calculated from  
   

ch (κ1  x1)  =   (κ1

2/λ1 )½ / E0 ,         ch (κ2  x2)  =   (κ2

2/λ2 )½ / E0 . 

 
Note that boundary condition for derivatives forces both the values to be the same sign, i.e., both 
points x1 , x2  should lie in the same half-space. Thus, in one medium we have only „a tail” from 
the  first  solution  and  in  the  second  medium  „a  bigger  part”  of  the  other  solution.  Because  the 
parameters x1 , x2  must be both positive or both negative, we should take into consideration each 
of this cases separately.  Fig.7 and Fig.8 show both cases respectively.

Fig. 8:     The soliton solution (shaded area) in the case of both negative parameters  x1 , x2 . 
 
The  proper  solutions  are  marked  as  shaded  area.  Henceforth,  we  will  refer  to  the  solution 
represented  by  this  area  simply  as  a  soliton  or  a  soliton  solution.  Note  a  significant  difference 
between the two figures.  The  sizes and shapes are quite different. Summarising, we can have a 
soliton (the shaded area) in either of the media. In which of them, in fact, depends on boundary 
conditions, more precisely, it depends on the sign of derivatives in (35). 
Apart  from  the  two  above  cases  there  is  also  a  remarkable  intermediate  case,  namely,  when              
x1  = x2  = 0. Then both „soliton peaks” lie on interface in the way shown in Fig.9.

(40) 

Notice, that amplitude of this soliton is  E0 . Since it is fixed, then with regard to the amplitude it 
is the smallest soliton at all. But as we will soon see, it is not the smallest soliton in the meaning 
of the power flow. The area under the curve  E(x) is proportional to the power provided. It could 
be calculated directly following Boardman et al. [ ]. Certainly, we should take into consideration 
the  signs  of  the  parameters  x1  ,  x2.  Thus,  there  are  two  branches  of    the  total  power    Ptot.  For 
negative x1 , x2  it is

Both branches meet each other at propagation constant given by equation (40). We will refer to it 
as kbi.As a matter of fact kbi  is a bifurcation point. In Fig.10 both branches of power are plotted

versus  propagation  constant  kz.  Note  that  P
tot    has  the  minimum  in  kmin    -  the  point  close  but 
different from kbi.

5. Conclusions 

 
In this paper we have systematically presented possible analytic solutions of the stationary version 
of  the  Nonlinear  Schrödinger  Equation  (5).  We  have  achieved  it  using  a  qualitative  analysis  of  
differential equations, i.e., the phase-plane method [10]. We have examined both, the real and the 
complex  cases  for  the  electric  field  component  Ey  .  The  main  point  of  our  paper  are  equations       
(25) and (31). To our knowledge, these solutions have not yet been presented in the context of a 
single  interface  between  two  nonlinear  media.  We  hope  that  in  future  investigations  such 
solutions could be  useful  to describe the incident  light in nonlinear medium.  As  an example of 
matching conditions on the interface, we have presented, in the last section, a very special case of 
the solutions, which is a spatial soliton.

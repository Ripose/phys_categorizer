In this work, a theoretical formulation for the early stage of hurricane development, in which 

analytical solutions have been found for this stage, is proposed. These solutions are not only 

consistent  with  observations  but  also  offer  some  new  insights  into  hurricane  properties. 

Traditionally,  theoretical  approaches  of  hurricanes  were  based  on  incipient  balanced 

relationships  between  wind  and  mass  fields  or  on  some  scaling  values,  e.g.  radius  of 

maximum  wind,  tangential  wind…,  to  linearize  the  primitive  equations.  Even  in  this 

linearized form, it has been not possible to come up with any analytical solutions. This is the 

first  time  (to  my  knowledge)  a  theoretical  model  for  the  initial  growing  of  hurricanes  is 

proposed  for  which  analytical  solutions  have  been  found,  based  on  an  assumption  of  a 

positive feedback process of a self-induced developing  system.  Starting  with  a  very  simple 

linear  theory  and  no  friction,  this  theoretical  theory  is  then  advanced  to  a  higher  level  in 

which nonlinear terms are included. The effect of friction will be considered in part II of this 

series  of  papers.  Analytical  results  are  consistent  in  many  aspects  with  observations.  This 

work will answer the question of “how hurricanes will evolve with time” in the presence of 

favorable conditions for hurricanes to grow.

1.  Introduction 

 

 

A traditional approach to hurricanes, generally, can be divided into two categories. The first 

is  a  theoretical  approach.  The  most  preferred  theoretical  idea  is  the  one  in  which  some 

scaling  parameters  (such  as  radius  of  maximum  wind  speed,  tangential  wind  speed,…)  are 

used  to  form  some  non-dimensional  numbers  or  to  make  scaling  evaluations  (Willoughby 

1979;  Montgomery  and  Farrell  1993;  Noland  and  Montgomery  2002;  Shapiro  et.  al.  1993; 

Holland  1997;  etc.).  Since  these  nondimensional  numbers  are  small,  the  field  variables  are 

expanded  as  a  series  in  terms  of  these  numbers.  By  restricting  the  expansion  to  the  first 

several  approximations,  the  primitive  equations  are  linearized.  It  is  therefore  possible  to 

separate  the  mean  balanced  fields  from  the  total  fields  and  a  new  system  of  linearized 

equations  for  perturbation  is  considered.  One  of  the  basic  characteristics  of  this  theoretical 

approach is that it is assumed a priori that a mature hurricane has been formed so that the 

scaling numbers are available. Even in this case, we still don’t have any information about 

the  analytical  solution  of  the  linearized  system  because  of  the  high  order  and  mixed 

derivatives  between  variables.  This  linearization  was  proven  to  be  a  good  way  to  describe 

some hurricane characteristics at the mature stage and continued to be the preferred method 

until  now.  Another  interesting  theoretical  idea  was  based  on  some  initial  equilibrium 

relationships  between  mass  and  wind  fields,  which  was  investigated  originally  by  Sawyer 

(1947)  and  Yanai  (1961),  (Palmen  and  Newton  1969,  chapter  15).  If  this  equilibrium  is 

2

disturbed,  tangential  and  radial  wind  will  develop.  By  following  this  route,  Yanai  has 

obtained  a  final  equation  which  contains  several  stability  coefficients.  Because  these 

coefficients have no explicit expression, no exact solution was obtained thus far.  

The  second  category  is  modelling.  In  recent  decades,  because  of  the  rapid  improvement  of 

computer speed, this promising approach emerged in which the full system of the primitive 

equations  has  been  used  to  simulate  hurricane  development.  This  method  offers  a  good 

chance (and perhaps the best way) to understand the development, structure and movement 

of  hurricanes  and  continue  to  become  more  and  more  sophisticated  (Zhang  et.  al.  2000; 

Challa et. al. 1998; Nguyen et. al. 2001; Zhu et. al. 2001; to name only a few). These models 

can  capture  very  detailed  processes  of  a  hurricane,  which  are  reasonably  consistent  with 

observations. It is however common to utilize a bogus vortex in hurricane modelling and this 

vortex is then integrated with time (Liu et. al. 1998; Pu et. al. 2001; Kwon et. al. 1999; etc.). 

By  using  numerical  models,  we  are  automatically  unable  to  get  any  information  about 

analytical solutions of hurricane processes.  

So far, neither of these above approaches, theoretical approaches or modelling, gives us an 

exact solution of the primitive equations at the early development stage of hurricanes. Due to 

the  nonlinear  nature  of  system  of  the  primitive  equations  as  well  as  unknown  small-scale 

processes,  it  appears  that  there  exists  no  analytical  solution  for  hurricane  phenomenon  to 

date. If we look back to many meteorological phenomena, such as fronts, stability, waves… 

or even Elnino, it will be found quickly that there is at least one model that gives us some 

analytical solutions to investigate. The purpose of this work is to fill out this gap in hurricane 

research by setting out a framework for investigating analytical solutions at the early stage of 

hurricanes. This work is fresh in two ways: first it describes the behaviours of hurricanes at 

the  initial  time  and  secondly,  it  gives  us  an  analytical  solution  for  this  stage.  It  will  be 

immediately anticipated that this preliminary work will contain in it many simplifications and 

even  somewhat  unrealistic  assumptions.  However,  as  we  shall  see,  it  is  very  useful  at 

capturing some basic characteristics of hurricanes with radius and height, such as wind and 

geopotential  fields.  This  work  should  be  regarded  as  an  intermediate  step  to  a  further 

complete  theory  of  hurricanes.  It  is  necessary  to  have  such  a  complete  hurricane  theory 

instead of borrowing a picture from the Rankine 2D vortex (Smith 1980; Kuo et. al. 1999; 

Holland).  This  is  not  very  helpful  because  the  Rankine  vortex  has  a  real  existence  of  an 

 

3

interface  (i.e.  water  surface)  while  in  the  atmosphere  it  is  impossible  to  see  such  a  surface 

directly.  We  will  find  in  section  3.1  that  such  vortex  will  also  lead  to  an  unrealistic 

description of hurricanes. 

2. Starting equations and basics assumptions 

  At the most basic level, all meteorological phenomena are described by six basic equations: 

three  momentum  equations,  the  continuity  equation,  the  thermodynamical  equation  and  the 

equation  of  state.  For  each  specific  meteorological  phenomenon  such  as  waves,  stability, 

fronts,  etc.,  there  are  from  observations  some  approximations  which  are  particularly 

applicable  to  this  phenomenon.  Using  these  approximations  it  is  then  possible  to  obtain  a 

system  of  simplified  equations  to  investigate  in  detail.  For  hurricanes,  we  do  the  same. 

However,  unlike  the  traditional  approaches  to  hurricanes  as  mentioned  in  the  introduction 

section, we now will attempt to obtain exact solutions of hurricane development rather than 

assuming the existence of a hurricane as these former approaches did. For completeness, the 

six basic equations of fluid motion in the atmosphere are re-written:

All  variables  in  the  above  equations  have  the  usual  meteorological  meaning.  It  should  be 

noted that eddy forcings are not contained in this system because all of these variables will 

not be averaged as usually encountered in meteorological problems. Only after we take the 

average operators do the eddy terms appear. The reason why we need to average all variables 

in  numerical  models  is  simply  because  we  don’t  and,  more  correctly,  have  no  way  to  deal 

with instantaneous values of field variables such as P, u, v, T. This is due to the limitations of 

observation and the stochastic nature of the atmosphere. It is also unnecessary to require such 

instant values in daily life. For the theoretical approach, this average is neglected. Fx and Fy 

here are the frictional forcings only, not related in any way to the eddy terms. Fcx, Fcy, Fcz are 

the Coriolis forces in the x, y and z directions, respectively.  Our purpose is, starting from 

this  system  and  some  basic  assumptions,  to  find  out  analytical  solutions  of  wind,  pressure, 

temperature fields which are consistent with the observations of hurricane characteristics.  

     Now we need to make some basic assumptions to start with. The first assumption will be 

based  on  one  important  characteristic  of  developing  systems:  a  positive  feedback.  This 

positive  feedback  at  the  early  stage  is  a  requirement  for  any  unstable  system  to  grow; 

otherwise,  the  system  will  come  back  to  its  initial  state  and  nothing  can  occur.  If  we  look 

back  to  our  starting  system  and  assume  at  the  beginning  there  is  no  motion  so  that  the 

pressure surface is flat, the wind field is zero (u=v=w=0), then a question is “how to trigger 

this system to evolve with time?” If one writes a program for this system and the initial data 

is a quiet atmosphere like that, clearly it is impossible to have a hurricane since the right hand 

side  of  the  primitive  system  ((1)  to  (6))  is  zero  everywhere.  Now  I  make  two  basic 

assumptions here: 1) heating source (J) will be proportional to the vertical motion (w): J = 

kw  and  2)  there  is  an  initial  vertical  motion  in  some  region.  In  nature,  it  is  obvious  that 

although there are upward motions always and nearly everywhere but hurricanes are rarely 

formed. So, the relationship J=kw is not always applicable. Even if this relation is valid, there 

is no guarantee that a hurricane will appear. A typical example is a deep convective region 

with a tower of cumulus or nimbus clouds. Whether a hurricane will appear depends on many 

other factors as pointed out in previous works and will not be mentioned here. But whenever 

there  is  a  hurricane,  we  can  expect  that  this  relationship  exists.  This  relationship  can  be 

verified by comparing the vertical profile of heating from observations, e.g. in Rodgers et. al. 

(1998),  and  of  vertical  motion,  e.g.  in  Palmen  and  Newton  (1969).  Of  course,  the 

 

5

development  of  a  hurricane  cannot  proceed  endlessly  because  when  it  reaches  some 

limitation, a new mechanism will appear to keep the hurricane from developing further. Here, 

we  are  considering  the  early  development  of  hurricanes  and  the  assumption  of  positive 

feedback will be acceptable provided that the final results are applied only for some limited 

initial period.  With the purpose of investigating the early phase of hurricane development, 

this assumption is made and our task now is to prove that analytical solutions describing the 

wind  or  geopotential  fields  of  a  hurricane  can  be  found,  based  on  this  assumption.  The 

meaning of this relation is clear. More upward motion will lead to more latent heat release 

and  buoyancy  force  will  be  larger  so  that  upward  motion  is  intensified.  Several  common 

assumptions  will  also  be  used,  such  as  Boussinesq  and  f-plane  approximations.  It  will  be 

stated  explicitly  whenever  these  approximations  are  used.  In  Part  I,  we  will  consider  two 

theories: linear and non-linear. These theories don’t have friction included. In Part II of this 

eries of paper, friction will be added.  

A  good  analytical  theory  must  have  solutions  which  satisfy  at  least  the  following 

properties obtained from observations: 

1A) The U-shape of geopotential at all level in the core region 

1B) Convergence of radial wind below (vertical wind increases with height) and divergence  

       of radial wind  above (vertical wind decreases with height) 

1C) motion is cyclonic and geopotential is of the U-shape in the upper atmosphere, where  

       divergence occurs (this property is very important)  

1D) The profile of tangential wind needs to reach a maximum at some radius and then  

  This section consists of two hypothetical theories. Starting from the simplest idealization in 

which neither nonlinear terms nor friction are considered in section 3.1, non-linear terms are 

       decrease with radius 

1E) Tangential wind has to decrease with height.

It  is  quickly  seen  that  we  are  here  confronted  with  a  very  difficult  problem:  a  non-linear 

system ((1) to (6)). Moreover, several field variables appear simultaneously and usually it is 

not possible to solve this system completely analytically. It is very common to investigate a 

complicated  system  by  starting  first  with  a  simplified  problem.  The  simple  description  is 

always  important  for  us,  allowing  for  some  preliminary  understandings  of  behaviors  of 

solutions.  This  simple  problem  can  show  us  the  advantages  and  the  shortcomings  of  our 

simplifications, from which we can make a further improvement. It is first to start with the 

case in which all the non-linear terms in system (1) to (6) are set to zero. As we shall see, 

such  simple  system  will  be  helpful  when  the  non-linear  cases  are  considered.  The 

assumptions for this simplest linear theory will be: 

-  No non-linear terms such as u∂u/∂x, u∂v/∂x, etc. This assumption is reasonable because 

at the early stage of hurricane development, it may be expected that u is small such that 

u∂u/∂x will be an order of magnitude smaller than ∂u/∂t. In section 3.2, these nonlinear 

terms will be included. 

-  No friction. This assumption seems to be inconsistent because, in a real hurricane, the 

frictional  convergence  at  low  level  actually  is  the  source  of  latent  heat  and  upward 

motion. Without friction, it seems that hurricanes are not able to develop. However, as 

we  shall  see,  the  assumption  of  the  proportional  relation  between  heating  and  vertical 

motion (J=kw) makes this no-friction assumption become acceptable.  

- 

Incompressible  fluid  dρ/dt=0  (the  changing  of  density  with  height  does  not  have  a 

significant influence and will be neglected)  

-  Boussisnesq approximation 

-  Heating source (J) is proportional to vertical motion (w) (J= kw where k is a constant 

proportional  coefficient).  Without  friction,  this  assumption  is  vital  to  hurricane 

development.  This  assumption  actually  is  a  complementary  for  the  no-friction 

assumption above. The assumption k = constant will be relaxed in an upcoming paper.  

-  F-plane  

With these above assumptions, the primitive system now becomes:

where Φ = p/ρ0, β2 = k/Cp-N2 (N2 is the buoyancy frequency). Here the relation J/Cp = kw has 

been used in equation (1.5). Note that Φ here is not really a geopotential field as defined in 

meteorology but it can represent well the geopotential field. The meaning of (1.3’) and (1.5’) 

is  very  special  and  need  to  have  more  explanations.  If    (1.3’)  and  (1.5’)  are  combined  for 

vertical motion, we will have a partial differential equation for the vertical motion and it is 

required  to  have  an  initial  condition  for  the  vertical  motion  to  obtain  a  final  solution. 

However,  if  these  equations  are  combined  to  get  an  equation  for  buoyancy,  an  initial 

condition for buoyancy will be required to obtain a final solution. This seems to be a trivial 

conclusion, but it turns out that we will have a very flexible situation in which hurricanes can

develop.    Another  special  attention  should  be  mentioned  is  that  (1.3’)  is  a  partial  equation 

with time only. It is the equation for the vertical motion at one point (x,y,z) and its solution, 

therefore, is the change of vertical motion at one point, not following an upward current. The 

development  of  the  vertical  motion  can  be  imagined  as  in  the  figure  below,  which  will  be 

very different if we have a total derivative.

This  profile  is  typical  for  any  vertical  motion  in  the  atmosphere  because  the  impenetrable 

surface  and  the  upper  stable  stratosphere  will  force  vertical  motion  to  be  zero  at  these

It should be noted that the solution (1.13) is just a particular solution. (1.12) has many other 

solutions.  However,  we  are  here  considering  the  early  development  of  hurricanes  and  thus 

expect that the final solution will grow with time. All other solutions, which increase linearly 

with time or additional constants, are neglected when compared to the exponential increase. 

In  order  to  solve  for  variable  Φ,  it  is  essential  to  know  the  functional  form  W1.  We  will 

assume that W1 is a separable function of z and (x,y): W1(x,y,z)=H(z)F(x,y). Let us consider 

two cases: 

 

 

a.  F(x,y) is Dirac-delta function: F(x,y)=δ(xo,yo). This case corresponds to a strong pulse 

of vertical motion a thet point (xo,yo).

In this case, (1.13) becomes:

Where D is a dimensional number of unit magnitude D=1(m2), so that the function Φ has a 

correct dimension. This number will be written explicitly so that the final results are always 

consistent in dimension. Because the solution (1.15) is not a harmonic function at infinity, we 

need to confine (1.15) within a closed region of maximum radius Rm (which can be made as 

large as needed but it must be finite). Outside this radius, Φ is constant and equal to Φ0. By 

imposing this condition, (1.15) has the final form as:

We now compare this result (fig. 2a) with an observation from a real hurricane (fig. 2b). Fig 

2b is the observation of the geopotential field at the 500mb surface of hurricane Anita at its 

mature stage. It may be ambiguous when comparing fig 2a, which is the solution at the early 

stage  of  hurricanes,  with  fig  2b,  which  is  the  observation  at  the  mature  stage.  However,  it 

should be noticed that the solution (1.16) is a separable solution in time, which will preserve 

its  dependence  on  radius  with  time.  The  only  change  is  the  magnitude  of  this  function. 

Therefore, if the theoretical geopotential field of a hurricane has a shape as shown in fig.2a at 

the initial time, it will continue to be so at the later time. Therefore, it is enough to compare 

the shape of a theoretical solution at the initial time with observations at the mature stage of a 

hurricane.  This  argument  will  also  be  applied  to  later  verifications  of  theoretical  solutions 

with observations.  

When  the  radius  approaches  zero,  the  solution  (1.16)  gives  a  wrong  description  of 

geopotential field. This is due to the assumption of Dirac-delta function of vertical velocity. 

In a real atmosphere, an upward region must have some finite dimension. However, the quite 

well-fit shape at the large radius tells us that any modification is expected to contain a natural 

logarithm  expression  of  radius  at  the  large  distance.  Because  at  this  moment  we  still  don’t 

11

have the correct functional form of the function Φ yet, the calculation of wind field will be 

postponed until a correct function for Φ is obtained. Consider now the second case:

Figure 3. The theoretical solution of geopotential with radius: step function (1.19a,b) 

It is first realized that the theoretical solutions (1.19a,b) have a U-shape as observed in fig 2b. 

However, if we pay a little deeper attention to our theoretical solution, it is then easy to find 

that  no  matter  how  the  parameters  in  (1.19a,b)  are  changed,  the  shape  of  the  theoretical 

solution is still a little shallower than observed. The geopotential field in fig 2b approaches a 

constant  value  very  quickly  from  the  core  to  nearly  50km  and  then  reaches  this  constant 

value very slowly. On the contrary, the theoretical curve in fig.3 reaches the constant value 

much faster than observation (more tilted outside the core region). This subtle difference will 

be resolved in the non-linear theory in the next section. Once again, as seen in the solutions 

(1.19a,b), both of these solutions increase exponentially with time. Therefore if at the initial 

time, the U-shape is shallow, it will continue to be so at the later time. The shallowness does 

not  change  with  time  and  the  difference  between  the  theoretical  solutions  and  the 

observations still exists.  

Because  of  the  quite  good  fit  between  the  analytical  solutions  and  observations,  we  now 

attempt to find the wind fields. Plugging (1.19a,b) into (1.8) leads to:

Figure 4. The theoretical solution of geopotential with radius: Delta function  

radius (normalized unit)

 

Note that in the case vertical wind decreases with height (in the upper half of the atmosphere: 

where  dH/dz<0),  this  profile  is  unchanged.  However,  the  tangential  wind  will  now 

immediately  become  anti-cyclonic  in  both  region  I  and  II  as  seen  in  the  solutions  (1.24a,b 

and 1.26a,b) (It is not very easy to see this conclusion directly in the Cartesian coordinate. 

We need to plot them out explicitly). It is very interesting that in a numerical study, Moller 

and  Shapiro  (2002)  have  pointed  out  that  a  hurricane  does  have  a  very  large  anti-cyclonic 

region throughout the upper half of the atmosphere far outside the core region. But anyway, 

the tangential wind near the core region is still cyclonic in their study and the linear theory is 

still inaccurate. 

Summary: 

 

 

Strengths: The tangential wind profile has a correct behavior with radius as observed. It first 

increases linearly with radius and then decreases as a function of inverse radius. The cyclonic 

sense  of  wind  is  also  captured  whenever  vertical  velocity  increases  with  height  (dH/dz>0), 

which  is  correct  in  the  lower  half  of  a  real  hurricane.  Both  the  tangential  wind  and  radial 

wind  increases  as  an  exponential  function  of  time,  which  tell  us  about  the  growing  of 

hurricanes as expected. The theoretical geopotential field is given by a parabolic shape in the 

region where the tangential wind increases linearly with radius. This analytical geopotential 

 

16

field  then  approaches  logarithmically  to  a  constant  value  at  the  large  radius,  which  also  fit 

pretty  well  observations.  Vertical  wind  increases  uniformly  as  an  exponential  function  of 

time within the region where positive feedback is effective and zero outside.  

 

Weaknesses:  This  linear  theory  will  immediately  give  a  hill  shape  of  gepotential  and 

anticyclonic wind whenever vertical motion decreases with height (violate 1A, 1B). This is 

not true because, in the upper half of a real hurricane where the vertical wind decreases with 

height, the U shape of geopotential still predominant and the tangential wind is still cyclonic 

up to 13km It is interesting to note that above 13km, the tangential wind is anticyclonic even 

near  the  core  region  as  seen  in  fig.  5b.  That  the  linear  theory  gives  a  hill-shape  of 

geopotential and an anti-cyclonic wind from the level where vertical velocity decreases with 

height is a proof of the useless of the 2D Rankine vortex in describing hurricanes. If we work 

out a little more, it is straightforward to find that the vertical profile of tangential wind also 

does  not  really  fit  observation  and  thus  violate  observation  1E.  In  addition,  because  of 

confining ourselves to the early stage of hurricane development, this theory is expected to be 

correct  up  to  first  6-12h  of  growing.  Beyond  this  period,  this  theory  may  give  inaccurate 

descriptions (unlimited growing).   

3.2. Nonlinear theory 

In this section, the linear system in section 3.1 will be generalized so that non-linear terms 

are included. The simple idealized theory in section 3.1 will be very helpful to us in obtaining 

the  solutions  of  the  following  non-linear  theory  as  we  shall  see.  It  is  expected  that  the 

nonlinear theory can explain the shallowness of the theoretical geopotential curve obtained in 

the  linear  theory  and,  more  importantly,  it  must  explain  for  the  U-shape  of  geopotential  as 

well as the cyclonic wind of the tangential wind in the upper half of the atmosphere, where 

wind is divergent. As mentioned in section 3.1, it was not possible to explain these facts with 

the linear theory. Now, we make some assumptions for a new non-linear theory for the early 

stage of hurricane development. The meaning of each assumption was explained in section 

 

 

 

 

3.1.    

17

Assumptions:  

-  Non-linear terms in the tangential and radial momentum equations are included, but 

non-linear terms in vertical and thermodynamic equations are neglected.  

-  No friction is considered 

- 

Incompressible fluid dρ/dt=0  

-  Boussisnesq approximation 

-  There exist a region of radius “a” around the point (xo,yo) in which vertical velocity 

(w) is related to heating source (J) by a positive feedback relationship (J=kw) 

-  F-plane 

To  facilitate  our  consideration  in  this  case,  it  is  better  to  start  the  system  of  primitive 

Because  of  the  symmetry  of  system  with  respect  to  azimuthal  angle,  the  system  ((2.1)  to

Because  of  the  reasonable  consistence  of  the  assumption  that  W1(x,y,z)  is  expressed  as 

product  of  a  step  function  of  (x,y)  and  a  function  of  z:  W1(x,y,z)  =  H(z)F(x,y)  as  seen  in 

section 3.1b, we will utilize this separable function from the beginning and solve the system 

((2.1’) to (2.5’)) in each region I and II separately.  

Region I 

From (2.4’) and using W1(x,y,z) = H(z) (since F(x,y)=1 in this region), we have

From  this  equation,  it  is  clear  that  the  tangential  wind  is  a  function  of  (r,  z,  t).  It  is  very 

difficult  to  solve  for  this  equation.  However,  the  simplified  linear  theory  in  section  3.1b 

suggests that v may be a linear function of radius. So we attempt to find the tangential wind 

in  the  form  of:    v  =  F(z,t)r  and  substitute  this  into  (2.9).  Also,  to  avoid  unnecessary 

cumbersome symbol, set Q=

(2.13) 

Up until this point nothing about the functional form of H(z), which is the profile of vertical 

velocity  with  height,  has  been  mentioned.  The  appearance  of  the  upper  tropopause  makes 

problem  become  special.  No  matter  how  large  the  buoyancy  is,  this  tropopause  (a  kind  of 

upper rigid lid) will make vertical velocity become zero right below it. The impact of this lid 

in some way can be thought of as an external forcing of an external mechanism and so far 

can  not  be  described  by  the  system  ((2.1’)  to  (2.5’)).  Because  the  functional  form  of  the 

vertical motion (H(z) in (2.7)) is not derived from the system ((2.1’) to (2.5’)) and somewhat 

arbitrary,  the  effect  of  boundaries  can  be  included  by  choosing  a  prescribed  function  such 

that the vertical velocity will be zero at the tropopause and surface. It is reasonable to choose: 

H(z)=W0sin(λz), where λ is expected to be inversely proportional to the standard height H0 

(H0 ≈10km) so that vertical velocity is equal to zero at z=0 and z=H0. This choice, however, 

is not unique. Several functional forms can be tested, such as the parabolic function, but the 

behavior  of  final  solutions  should  be  the  same  because  the  system  ((2.1’)  to  (2.5’))  is  the 

first-order  differential  system.  From  the  definition  of  Q=

Note  that  (2.14)  has  an  infinitive  number  of  separable  solutions  but  we  are  here  just 

considering  the  growing  solutions  with  time.  It  is  usual  to  find  the  final  solution  of  an 

inhomogeneous equation by setting F(z,t)=G(z,t)Fm(z,t) and plug it into (2.12). By following 

this  way,  we  will  come  up  with  an  even  more  complicated  than  the  original  equation. 

However, it is possible to eliminate the non-homogenous term by realizing that the last two 

terms  in  the  RHS  of  (2.12)  are  linear  in  Q  and  contain  no  derivative  in  F,  so  a  particular 

solution of (2.12) can be chosen as follows:

We  now  plot  the  profile  of  the  homogeneous  solution  Fm  to  see  how  it  varies  with  height 

since it will tell us about the vertical profile of tangential wind. (Note that in the linear theory 

in section 3.1, the profile for tangential wind is a cosine function of height if H(z)=W0sin(λz). 

This means that wind will be anticyclonic as soon as there is a divergence of wind (vertical 

velocity decreases with height dH/dz<0)). As seen in Fig.5a, we now have a tangential wind 

decrease with height and still have a cyclonic sense when dH/dz < 0 as expected, provided 

that the homogeneous solution is large enough to overcome the particular solution –f/2. Only 

at very high altitude does particular solution –f/2 have a possibility to become greater than 

the  homogeneous  solution  Fm  and  an  anti-cyclonic  tangential  wind  will  appear  at  high 

altitude only, exactly as observed in fig. 5b.

Several  interesting  points  of  the  solution  (2.23)  should  be  recapitulated.  First,  it  gives  us  a 

correct  description  of  the  tangential  wind  with  radius  near  the  core  of  a  hurricane,  a  linear 

increase. Secondly and more interestingly, the tangential wind in this region increases as an 

exponential  function  of  exponential  of  time,  which  is  much  stronger  than  radial  wind 

(exponential  of  time  only).  This  much  stronger  increase  is  due  to  the  appearance  of  the 

vertical  advection  terms  in  equation  (2.2’).  If  these  vertical  advections  are  eliminated,  the 

change in tangential wind with time will be exponential of time only, which is the same as 

that  in  section  3.1b  for  the  linear  theory.  The much  faster  increase  of  tangential  wind  with 

23

time in the core region may be expected if an eye is formed at the later time. Another feature 

is that the solution (2.23) is a decrease function of height, which means that tangential wind 

will decrease with height. The point z=0 is a special point at which tangential wind is equal 

to infinity and can be eliminated by assuming H(z) = sin(λz+φ) so that at z=0 there is little 
vertical motion, or alternatively, by assuming the lower boundary is at some height z* rather 

than at z=0. Finally, the cyclonic motion still exists at divergent levels as long as the first two 

terms in (2.23) are greater than the last term.  

Region II 

 

 

As  in  the  region  I,  we  first  solve  for  the  radial  wind  in  this  region.  Because  w  =  0  in  the 

region II (or at least a function of time and radius only), it is immediate to integrate (2.4’) 

with radius to obtain the solution for the radial wind:

Using  the  continuous  condition  of  radial  wind  at  radius  r  =  a  and  zero  at  infinity  (we  can 

regard Rm as a very large radius so that approximately we have a infinitive closed region), it 

is simple to find that: C1=0 and C2 =

(2.33) 

Since  cos(λz)  is  greater  than  zero  for  0<λz<π/2  (the  lower  half  of  the  atmosphere),  the 

tangential wind in the lower half of the atmosphere will be cyclonic (greater than zero).  In 

the upper half of the atmosphere, cos(λz) is smaller than zero because π/2<λz< π. However, it 

is interesting that motion can still be cyclonic in the upper atmosphere if the constant C(z) is 

large  enough.  We  thus  have  a  cyclonic  motion  as  expected  for  the  lower  atmosphere  and 

even for the upper atmosphere where divergence occurs. This feature could not be obtained 

by the linear theory in section 3.1.  

However,  there  no  longer  has  a  continuity  of  the  tangential  wind  at  r=a  as  in  the  linear 

theory.  This  is  because,  when  vertical  advection  is  included,  basically,  the  tangential 

momentum equation has been added a soruce term which is zero outside the radius r=a and is 

an exponential function of time inside. Therefore, the solution (2.23) for the tangential wind 

increases  very  strongly  with  time  while  the  solution  (2.33)  does  not.  The  hurricane 

development at the early stage can be imagined according to this non-linear theory as in the

It is very interesting that in the early developing stage of a real hurricane, observations have 

shown that, at the early phase of hurricane development, there is a very rapid increase of the 

tangential  wind  inside  the  core  region  and  a  much  slower  increase  of  the  tangential  wind 

outside as shown in fig.7 for hurricane DIANA. Clearly this feature is captured very well by 

the  solutions  (2.23)  and  (2.33).  Many  other  examples  can  be  found  in  Willoughby  et.  al. 

The final task is to find a solution for the function Φ, which has the meaning the same as a 

geopotential field in meteorology. We expect that with this new non-linear model, it is then 

possible  to  have  a  U-shape  of  geopotential  when  vertical  velocity  decreases  with  height  as 

 

 

(1990).

observed. As noted in section 3.1, the linear theory could not possess this feature. Whenever 

dH/dz<0,  according  to  this  linear  theory,  motion  will  be  anticyclonic  and  a  high  pressure 

system will develop. (In a real hurricane, hurricanes do have anticyclonic motion but it is just 

near  the  tropopause,  whereas  dH/dz  is  less  than  zero  from  the  middle.).  Starting  with

Because H ≈ sin(λz), Q ≈ - dH/dz will be less than zero in the lower atmosphere and dQ/dz = 
-d2H/dz2 is greater than zero. In this case, the first three terms inside the bracket in (2.37) are 

greater  than  zero  and  the  last  two  terms  are  smaller  than  zero.  Note  that  since  K  is  a  very 

sensitive function of time, K-terms will dominate at later time and the sum inside the bracket 

on the RHS of (2.37) will tend to be positive. Therefore, a low pressure system (U-shape of 

geopotential) will develop at the lower atmosphere.  

Now consider the case in which dH/dz<0 as it is in the upper atmosphere. In this case Q>0 

and dQ/dz<0. In this case only the first two terms inside the bracket of (2.37) are positive. 
Note  here  again  that  the  term  K2  is  always  positive  and  it  is  the  most  weighted  term. 

Therefore, the bracket term in the RHS of (2.37) is still positive and we still have a U-shape 

of geopotential. These are excellent results which are not obtained by the linear theory. Near 

the tropopause, K can be smaller than zero because of the strong decrease of K with height

(fig. 5a) and there may have an anticyclonic motion exactly as observed. Interesting is that, 

even in the case K<0, it is still possible to have the U-shape of geopotential.  

The final task now is to find an expression for the function Φ in the region II by using u2, v2  

(remember  that  we  have  chosen  the  vertical  velocity  to  be  zero  in  the  region  II).  Plug  all 

these solutions in to equation (2.1’):

The geopotential field now decreases not only as a natural logarithm of the inverse of radius 

but  a  little  faster  by  the  terms  that  are  inversely  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  radius. 

These extra terms make the theoretical solution (2.41) fit better with the observed curve in 

fig. 2b. This little change explains for the deep U-shape of the observation of geopotential in 

fig  2b,  which  can  not  be  accounted  for  in  the  linear  theory.  In  the  non-linear  theory,  the 

geopotential field inside region I will be deepened much faster (given by (2.40)) than that in 

region II (given by (2.41)) and we thus have once again the discontinuity of geopotential at 

 

 

 

 

later time.  

Summary:

Strengths: This non-linear theory so far captures all the good points in the linear theory (as it 

must) such as the linear increase of the tangential wind with radius and subsequent decrease 

as a function of inverse radius, the cyclonic sense of wind, the U-shape of geopotential field 

and so on. In addition, this theory now offers some new properties. First, the tangential wind 

in  the  region  where  the  positive  feedback  is  effective  will  no  longer  increase  as  an 

exponential  of  time.  Instead,  it  increases  much  stronger,  as  an  exponential  function  of 
exponential  of  time  (exp(ekt)),  which  is  much  faster  than  the  radial  wind  or  the  tangential 

wind  outside  this  feedback  region.  This  may  help  us  explain  why  hurricanes  have  an  eye 

formed  in  this  region  (it  does  not  mean  that  hurricanes  have  an  eye  at  this  moment.  It  just 

means that the tangential wind tends to form an eye). Secondly, this nonlinear model gives us 

a decrease of tangential wind with height, which is exactly what we observed. Finally, this 

model  is  also  able  to  give  us  a  potentially  deeper  U-shape  of  geopotential  as  well  as  the 

cyclonic motion even when we have divergence in the upper half of the atmosphere, which 

was not obtained by the linear theory. 

 

Weaknesses:  In  this  nonlinear  theory,  we  now  cannot  expect  to  have  continuous  tangential 

wind  and  geopotential  fields.  This  is  because  we  have  assumed  a  step  function  of  the 

feedback mechanism. This step function creates an exponential increase with time of vertical 

wind  and,  consequently,  the  vertical  advection  within  the  region  subjected  to  positive 

feedback. Outside this region, vertical velocity is zero and thus vertical advection is zero too.  

The root of this discontinuity lies in the step-function assumption and will be removed Part 

II. Also, as in the linear model, because we confined ourselves to the early stage of hurricane 

development, this theory is also expected to be correct up to first 6-12h of growing. Beyond 

this period, this theory may give inaccurate descriptions.   

4.  Unresolved problems 

First,  as  we  can  find  throughout  this  work,  we  always  assume  the  existence  of  a  positive 

feedback  between  latent  heat  source  and  vertical  motion.  Now  the  question  is  under  which 

conditions  is  this  feedback  effective?  Clearly,  there  always  has  vertical  motion  in  the 

atmosphere  but  hurricanes  appear  rarely.  This  work  basically,  so  far,  gives  no  information 

 

 

 

29

about when this feedback mechanism will appear. Instead, it has been assumed implicitly that 

this positive feedback will always exist so that a self-induced system will develop. Once this 

assumption  is  meaningful,  we  will  have  the  solutions  that  have  been  found  in  sections  3.1 

and 3.2.  This positive feedback is very vital for these above theories. However, it should be 

linked in some way with friction so that the feedback will be controlled. Another feedback 

mechanism will be considered in an upcoming paper. 

Second,  in  both  the  linear  and  non-linear  theories,  wind  and  geopotential  field  will 

increase with time endlessly. This is not true because when hurricanes reach a mature stage, 

another  process  will  appear  or  dominate  to  consume/limit  the  source  of  energy  so  that 

hurricanes  can  not  grow  forever.  The  root  of  the  unlimited  growing  lies  once  again  in  the 

assumption of the positive feedback. In all of the above models, this feedback is independent 

from any internal mechanism so that it is always possible to find a solution for radial wind 

and  vertical  wind  independently.  Using  these  radial  and  vertical  winds,  we  then  find 

tangential wind and geopotential field. Basically, the system of primitive equations has been 

separated  into  two  sub-systems:  one  for  the  radial  and  vertical  wind  and  one  for  the 

tangential wind and geopotential. This independence will be removed if we can find a way to 

link a feedback process to the tangential wind.   

Third,  we  have  neglected  all  the  advection  terms  in  the  vertical  momentum  and 

thermodynamic equations so that the closed system between radial and vertical wind ((2.3’) 

and  (2.5’))  is  simplified.  This  assumption,  however,  is  not  a  major  weakness  because 

hurricanes  are  azimuthally  symmetric,  and  we  will  always  have  a  closed  system  between 

vertical wind and radial wind as long as the positive feedback is related to radial and vertical 

wind  only.  Normally,  these  advection  terms  are  largest  near  the  surface  or  the  tropopause 

because  radial  wind  is  strongest  here.  The  inclusion  of  the  advection  terms  in  the  vertical 

momentum  equation  and  thermodynamic  equation  will  make  problem  become  very 

complicated. However, it is fortunate that, at these levels, the radial gradient of both vertical 

wind  and  temperature  (∂w/∂r,  ∂b/∂r)  are  very  small.  Therefore,  these  total  advections  are 

quite  small  and  it  is  reasonable  to  expect  that  these  advection  terms  will  not  have  any 

significant impact on the hurricane development. 

Finally, both the linear and non-linear theories in this work do require a pre-existing 

vortex so that the solutions are valuable. We can see this point quickly by setting t=0 in all 

 

30

solutions obtained so far, such as (2.6), (2.7), (2.23), (2.33)….Now the question is  “does this 

work really describe the early stage of hurricane development as stated”, since it also needs 

an initial vortex to start with as the traditional approaches do? The root of this requirement 

lies  in  two  facts:  the  positive  feedback  assumption  and  the  applicability  of  the  governing 

equations.  First  we  should  ask  ourselves:  “Is  a  positive  feedback  effective  in  a  quiet 

atmosphere?” Of course it is not. In order to be effective, this feedback mechanism requires 

an  initial  vertical  velocity  so  that  latent  heat  can  be  released.  Therefore,  right  at  the  initial 

time,  vertical  velocity  must  be  different  from  zero.  Due  to  the  existence  of  the  tropopause 

and the impenetrable lower surface, vertical velocity will be zero at both these levels. Thus, 

dw/dz will be different from zero and there is an unavoidable convergence/divergence. If the 

continuity equation is valid at this initial time, radial wind must be different from zero. The 

other two constraints imposed by equations (2.1’) and (2.3’), similarly, cause the tangential 

wind and geopotential field to have some initial values and the existence of an initial vortex 

is  necessary.  We  have  no  way  to  escape  an  initial  vortex  in  above  theories.  Usually  in  the 

atmosphere,  at  the  early  stage  of  any  meteorological  phenomenon,  there  will  appear  a 

transient  period  in  which  no  equation  can  be  applied  because  this  transient  period  is 

stochastic and chaotic. Only after some moment, when the phenomenon becomes governed 

by the fluid equations, can we employ these equations to this phenomenon. Forcing all field 

variables  to  grow  controllably  by  the  governing  equations  is  equivalent  to  an  assimilation 

process  in  a  numerical  model.  The  data  assimilation  can  be  regarded  as  a  process  which 

forces  all  field  variables  to  proceed  in  a  balanced  way  at  the  initial  time.  If  somehow  the 

atmosphere has vertical motion but radial wind is still zero everywhere, this will immediately 

mean  that  the  fluid  equations  are  not  appropriate  yet  (the  appearance  of  vertical  motion 

instantly implies that the divergence or convergence will be different from zero because of 

the  upper  and  bottom  boundaries).  On  the  contrary,  if  we  suppose  that  the  governing 

equations are applicable, by assuming a positive feedback, we automatically have radial wind 

and  geopotential  fields  different  from  zero  at  the  initial  time.  Obviously,  no  hurricane  can 

develop  from  a  quiet  atmosphere.  Therefore,  a  pre-existing  vortex  is  a  natural  requirement 

for  these  above  theories.  Note  that  we  can,  in  principal,  create  this  initial  vortex  nearly  as 

weak  as  we  want,  depending  on  how  small  the  initial  vertical  velocity  is  but  it  can  not  be 

 

31

zero. It should be careful that the assumption of positive feedback will require that the initial 

vertical velocity be large enough and the initial vortex thus can not be too weak.              

So  far,  nothing  about  the  eye  of  a  hurricane  has  been  mentioned  in  this  work.  The 

question is “does a hurricane have an eye at the early stage of its development?” Actually, as 

we  can  find  in  any  theories  from  section  3.1  and  3.2,  vertical  motion  is  given  by  an 

exponential  function  of  time  inside  the  whole  region  I  and  zero  elsewhere.  Is  this  a  really 

weakness of these theories? I don’t think so. A hurricane, at its very first stage, needs to have 

a  very  strong  mechanism  to  develop  and  in  this  early  stage  of  development,  it  would  not 

show its eye clearly (Palmen and Newton 1969). It is reasonable to believe that our solutions 

will  not  need  to  contain  an  eye  in  the  early  stage  of  hurricane  development.  Rather,  these 

solutions  need  to  have  the  potential  of  building  an  eye  as  hurricane  develop  and  this  is 

exactly what we obtained in section 3.2 (the tangential wind in region I grows much faster 

than in region II, (2.23) vs. (2.33)) 

It is perhaps ambiguous that, instead of introducing a prescribed radius of maximum 

wind  speed  as  is  usually  encountered  in  literatures  (Smith  1980;  Kuo  et.  al.  1997),  I  have 

launched a region of radius “a” to consider. These above theories appear to employ a scaling 

parameter  of  mature  hurricanes  and,  therefore,  they  are  invalid  for  the  early  description  of 

hurricane development. However, the point is that I introduced here not a number (radius of 

the positive feedback region)  but a mechanism  (positive feedback) and everything emerges 

naturally.  This  is  important  since  we  can  postulate  different  tentative  mechanisms  to 

investigate the behaviors of the solution analytically. My assumption here about a feedback 

mechanism  leads  to  a  correction  in  many  respects  with  observations  at the  early  stage  of  a 

hurricane, and this is new.  

5.  Discussion and conclusion 

By assuming that there exists a positive feedback within a region of radius r=a and using first 

the simple linear theory (section 3.1), we have obtained analytical solutions that have several 

characteristics that agree with hurricane observations such as the U-shape of geopotential, the 

linear increase with radius near a core region and the decrease as a function of inverse radius 

outside this region of tangential wind. These solutions are somewhat the same as those of the 

 

 

 

32

2D  Rankine  vortex.  However,  several  important  aspects  of  the  linear  theory  are  not 

represented properly. First, the tangential wind does not have a correct profile with height as 

observed.  The  tangential  wind,  according  to  this  linear  theory,  will  be  anti-cyclonic  when 

vertical  wind  decreases  with  height  (divergent).  In  a  real  hurricane,  observations  actually 

show that cyclonic wind penetrates deeply nearly up to the tropopause and then turns anti-

cyclonic in a very shallow layer right below the tropopause (fig.5b). Second, the theoretical 

geopotential  field  will  immediately  have  a  hill  shape  in  the  upper  half  of  the  atmosphere 

where  vertical  wind  decreases  with  height.  In  fact,  like  tangential  wind,  observations  also 

pointed out that the geopotential field in real hurricanes has a U-shape up to the tropopause 

regardless  of  divergence  or  convergence  of  wind.  Moreover,  the  U-shape  of  the  theoretical 

geopotential field is somewhat shallower than that of a real hurricane. Note once again that 

both  the  geopotential  fields  inside  and  outside  the  feedback  region  increase  exponentially 

with  time  (eqns  (1.19a,b)).  Therefore,  if  at  the  initial  time,  the  U-shape  is  shallow,  it  will 

continue  to  be  so  at  the  later  time  and  the  difference  between  the  theoretical  solutions  and 

observations  still  exists.  These  contradictions  show  us  clearly  the  weaknesses  of  the  linear 

theory.  

It should be mentioned that these weaknesses do not diminish the role of the simplified linear 

theory. This theory turns out to be very helpful to us in obtaining the analytical solutions in 

the non-linear theory as we saw in section 3.2. When a new problem is explored, it is usual to 

start with a simple problem first. This simplified problem will help us obtain some insights 

into what is correct, what is not and why it is not correct. This is particularly helpful since, 

from  this  information,  it  is  possible  to have  some  good  speculations  and  understandings  to 

make further improvements.      

To  overcome  all  of  the  shortcomings  of  the  linear  theory,  the  full  non-linear  system  of 

primitive  equations  has  been  used  (except  the  vertical  momentum  and  thermodynamic 

equations).  From  this  theory,  we  have  obtained  analytical  solutions  that  fit  well  with  the 

observations  in  many  respects.  In  this  non-linear  theory,  a  particular  technique  has  been 

utilized to find the solutions which are separable in the radius, time and height. These are not 

the only solutions we can get since the solutions obtained so far belong to a separable class 

and there must exist many other solutions (as many as phenomena we meet in the atmosphere 

everyday).  In  different  situations,  it  admits  a  different  set  of  solutions  that  describes  the 

 

33

situation  under  consideration.  It  is  a  beautiful  property  of  mathematics  to  contain  so  many 

different solutions to a system of equations, but it is even more amazing how the Nature can 

show  us  some  of  these  solutions  in  the  physical  world.  Other  unknown  solutions  may  not 

have  physical  meaning  or  they  can  not  express  themselves  in  nature  because  of  some 

restricted  conditions.  The  solutions  obtained  so  far  can  be  thought  of  as  a  solution  at  the 

initial phase of a hurricane in the special conditions that I imposed (that is, the existence of a 

positive  feedback  region  of  radius  “a”).  We  may  choose  other  assumptions  but  after  all  I 

believe  that  it  is  possible  to  find  an  analytical  solution  for  hurricanes  satisfactorily.  The 

small-scale processes or the asymmetric properties contribute to the minor characteristics of 

hurricanes only and will be altered in different cases, but the main behaviors should be the 

same.  

The non-linear theory presented in this work has a critical disadvantage: the discontinuity of 

tangential  wind  and  geopotential  field  when  hurricanes  develop.  This  discontinuity  will  be 

solved in part II of this series of papers. It was found that this discontinuity is actually not a 

serious problem and can be removed satisfactorily.   

With the fact that these above theories need an initial vortex to start with, this work should be 

considered as a finding of the analytical solution for the early stage of hurricane development 

once  the  favorable  conditions  for  hurricanes  to  grow  have  appeared.  This  work  does  not 

answer  the  question  “under  which  conditions  does  appear  such  a  vortex  initially?”  It  may 

help  us  explain  why  we  usually  have  to  create  a  bogus  vortex  in  numerical  models  to 

integrate.  This  work  also  provides  a  method  for  constructing  such  a  bogus  vortex 

analytically.

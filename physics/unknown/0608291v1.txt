Abstract 

Using  exact  three-dimensional  vectorial  simulations  of  radiation  coupling  into  uncoated 

dielectric  fiber  probes,  we  calculate  amplitude  transfer  functions  for  conical  single-mode 

fiber tips at the light wavelength of 633 nm.  The coupling efficiency of glass fiber tips is 

determined  in  a  wide  range  of  spatial  frequencies  of  the  incident  radiation  for  opening 

angles varying  from  30° to 120°.  The  resolution in near-field imaging  with these tips is 

considered for field distributions limited in both direct and spatial-frequency  space.  The 

characteristics  of  the  transfer  functions  describing  the  relation  between  probed  optical 

fields and near-field images are analyzed in detail.  The importance of utilizing a perfectly 

sharp tip is also examined.

1.  Introduction 

The invention1,2 of the scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) has opened new avenues 

in  optical  microscopy.    Previously,  the  detection  of  scattered  light  from  a  sample  under  study 

took  place  in  the  far-field  only,  limiting  the  achievable  resolution  to  approximately  half  the 

wavelength3.  The SNOM overcomes this problem by measuring the field at a distance of only a 

few tens of nanometers above the sample4, close enough to detect sub-wavelength components of 

the  optical field; the near-field, before these decay  below the background radiation  floor.   The 

SNOM  has  successfully  been  used  in  a  wide  range  of  near-field  detection  experiments;  i.e.  to 

achieve  image  resolution  of  ~  l/40  at  visible  wavelengths5,  to  study  the  excitation  of  surface 

plasmon polaritons6 and to image light propagation in photonic crystal waveguides7. 

A commonly used configuration is the collection-mode SNOM4.  It features a nano-collector 

consisting  of  a  single-mode  fiber  terminating  in  a  tapered  tip.    The  tip  is  scanning  above  the 

sample  and  couples  the  near-field  to  the  guided  mode  of  the  fiber.    The  propagating  signal  is 

detected remotely and a SNOM image is obtained. 

The  interpretation  of  the  measured  image,  however,  has  been  subject  to  debate8-13.    The 

SNOM  clearly  allows  detection  of  sub-wavelength  features,  but  in  spite  of  progress  in  the 

understanding  of  the  field-image  coupling  mechanism,  the  exact  relation  between  the  optical 

field and the observed SNOM image remains unclear. 

Near-field  detection  is  generically  complicated  by  the  close  proximity  of  the  fiber  tip, 

resulting in tip-sample interaction modifying the free-space optical field generated in absence of 

the  nano-collector.    The  detected  field  thus  includes  a  perturbation  of  the  original  free-space 

field, a perturbation that is generally difficult or impossible to separate.  Fortunately, it has been 

shown that for a dielectric sample studied in the photon tunneling SNOM setup, the tip-sample 

 

2 

interaction is negligible14, and in this case the fiber tip can be approximated to a passive detector 

of the optical field. 

Initially,  the  nano-collector  was  considered  a  point-like  probe8  detecting  the  optical  field 

intensity at a specific position.  It was argued9 that the finite size of the probe should be taken 

into  account  by  introducing  a  transfer  function  (TF).    The  intensity  transfer  function  (ITF), 

relating  the  absolute  square  of  the  electric  field  to  the  SNOM  image,  was  proposed9  and  the 

conception  that  the  image  represents  field  intensity  below  a  spatial  frequency  cut-off  has  been 

used to analyze experimental near-field data15,16. 

It  was  then  shown  that  the  ITF  does  not  accurately  model  the  field-image  relation10.    The 

correct general framework necessary for describing the field-image coupling was given in Ref. 

11.  It was pointed out12 that when utilizing a single-mode fiber, the general TF can be described 

by an amplitude coupling function.  General symmetry  properties of this TF, correctly relating 

the optical field to the image, are given in Ref. 13. 

Further  information  about  the  nature  of  the  TF  was  obtained  as  comparisons17-19  between 

modeling  and  experiment  revealed  correspondence  between  detected  SNOM  images  and  the 

intensities  of  the  free  space  fields  in  planes  a  distance  above  the  tip  apex.    This  hints  that  the 

optical field may be coupled to the guided fiber mode not at the very tip apex, but in an effective 

detection point inside the tip. 

However, to completely understand the field-image relation, exact numerical modeling of the 

field scattered on the fiber tip must be performed.  A comparison between free-space field and 

image  measured using a reduced 2D tip without invoking  the concept of TF  was performed in 

Ref. 20, and calculations of 2D TFs were presented in Ref. 21.  We present here a technique to 

numerically determine TFs for realistic uncoated fiber tips using full 3D vectorial modeling and 

 

3 

we  have  determined  the  TFs  for  conical  tips  of  varying  geometry.    The  main  results  are  that 

optimal field to fiber coupling is obtained for a large rather than a small opening angle, and that 

the fiber tip need not be sharp. 

This  article  is  organized  as  follows:    In  section  2  the  theoretical  framework  necessary  to 

describe the coupling of the optical field is summarized.   We describe the modeling technique 

employed in section 3.  The results of the numerical simulations are given in section 4, and the 

implications  for  the  field-image  relation  are  discussed  in  section  5.    A  conclusion  follows  in 

section 6. 

2.  Near-field coupling 

The general experimental SNOM setup we will model is illustrated in Fig. 1.  A dielectric sample 

with sub-wavelength features is placed on a prism and is subject to illumination from below at 

the wavelength l of 633 nm.  The sample scatters the light, and a near-field is generated. 

The SNOM fiber tip is scanned above the sample in constant height mode4 with tip apex in a 

detection plane 

z =

dz

.  Other scanning modes, such as constant distance mode4, are frequently 

used in SNOM microscopy, but the TF relates the field in a detection plane of fixed z coordinate 

to the image and the choice of constant height mode is thus necessary if field-image comparisons 

are to be made.   

The  tip  couples  the  field  to  the  guided  fiber  mode  but  also  scatters  light  back  towards  the 

sample.    We  restrict  our  analysis  to  SNOM  measurements  on  weakly  reflecting  dielectric 

samples where the tip-sample interaction can be ignored14 and we thus only treat the coupling of 

the near-field into the guided mode.  Also, we assume that power levels are sufficiently low so 

that linear scattering can be assumed.  These  restrictions are made as the TF, relating the free-

space field with the observed SNOM image, is only defined11 in the linear scattering regime and 

 

4 

in  absence  of  multiple  reflections  between  tip  and  sample.    A  treatment  of  the  field-image 

relation in setups where the tip-sample interaction or non-linear effects are important is beyond 

the scope of this paper.

The detailed derivation of this equation is given in the Appendix.  In Eq. (5),

represent the coupling of an incoming plane wave of s- and p-polarization respectively with in-

plane wave vector of norm k to a guided fiber mode.  Due to symmetry, the functions 

)(kH s

 and 

)(kH p

 are independent of the angle of incidence q. 

The  functions 

)(kH s

  and 

)(kH p

  are  the  TFs  that  describe  the  detection  capability  of  a 

particular fiber tip that we aim at determining numerically. 

3.  Modeling 

In general, exact 3D vectorial simulation of light scattering by nano-structures requires extensive 

computer  power,  but  for  the  fiber  tip  geometry  we  can  exploit  the  rotational  symmetry  of  the 

fiber.    In  cylindrical  coordinates  we  can  write  the  electric  field  as  a  sum  of  contributions  of 

different angular momenta: 

E

,(
r

f

),
z

e

m

),(
ezr

im

f

. 

(cid:2)=

m

(6) 

In a rotationally symmetric geometry such as the optical fiber, the various contributions are not 

coupled, and it is only necessary to perform calculations for the angular momentum of the guided 

fiber mode.  This effectively reduces the number of dimensions from 3 to 2, making  exact 3D 

vectorial calculations feasible with only modest computing power. 

The method chosen in this work to model the scattering of plane waves into the guided fiber 

mode is the eigenmode expansion technique (EET).  The structure is divided into layers along an 

 

 

 

7 

axis of propagation, here chosen as the z-axis.  The field is expanded on the eigenmodes in each 

layer  and  the  fields  on  each  side  of  a  layer  interface  are  connected  using  the  transfer  matrix 

formalism.  The general method is well described in Ref. 22.  However, the eigenmodes need to 

be  determined.    These  can  be  obtained  analytically  in  a  cylindrically  symmetric  structure  by 

solving a well established transcendental equation23. 

The fiber tip geometry modeled in this work is that of a tapered single-mode fiber with core 

and  cladding  refractive  indices  of  1.4622  and  1.4572  respectively  and  core  diameter  of  4  mm.  

Real  optical  fibers  feature  a  cladding  diameter  of  ~  125  mm,  but  since  the  guided  mode  is  no 

longer  affected  by  the  cladding-air  index  step  for  a  cladding  diameter  above  ~  16  mm,  the 

cladding diameter is limited to that value to save computation time.  The wavelength l is 633 nm 

in all calculations. 

As the EET treats layered structures, we model the conically shaped tip using a large number 

of  thin  layers,  resulting  in  a  saw-tooth  profile.    The  number  of  layers  must  be  ~  500  to 

sufficiently  smoothen  out  the  saw-tooth  profile  and  achieve  convergence  of  the  TF.    Here,  the 

EET  technique  has  an  advantage  compared  to  other  techniques,  as  the  total  computation  time 

increases only linearly with the number of layers. 

A  weakness  of  the  EET,  however,  is  the  necessity  of  enclosing  the  fiber  tip  geometry  in  a 

metal cylinder introducing reflections from the cylinder wall.  Our calculations were performed 

for cylinder diameters of 20, 40, 60 and 80 mm.  In general we saw only negligible influence of 

the  cylinder  diameter  on  the  TF,  however  for  the  opening  angle  of  90(cid:1),  a  small  oscillatory 

dependence  on  cylinder  diameter  was  observed  in  the  first  part  of  the  propagating  regime 

(

0 <kk

/

5.0

) of the TF.  In this region the TF for b =  90(cid:1) is thus slightly affected by numerical 

uncertainty. 

 

8 

With 1000 eigenmodes and 512 layers along the z-axis the total computation time for a TF is 

~ 50 hours on a 2.6 GHz desktop PC with 1 GB of RAM. 

4.  Results 

The TF allows us to determine the power carried by the guided fiber mode for a given incoming 

light  intensity  as  function  of 

k

^= k

.    The  following  TFs  are  calculated  for  an  electric  field 

amplitude  of  27.5  kV/m  in  the  detection  plane  corresponding  to  an  illumination  intensity  of  1 

mW/mm2 for a propagating wave. 

TFs determined for s- and p-polarization for various opening angles are depicted in Fig. 3.  In 

the  propagating  regime  (

0 <kk

/

1

)  we  observe  an  oscillatory  behavior  for  all  the  TFs  of  both 

polarizations.  The peaks in this part of the spectrum represent coupling resonances, the positions 

of which depend on geometry.  In the evanescent regime we generally observe a monotonic near-

exponential  decrease  except  for  p-polarization  in  the  interval 

1

<

/
kk

0 <

5.1

  when  b  =  60°  or 

90°.  We also note that for 

0 >kk

/

1

 the coupling efficiency as function of opening angle seems 

to be at a maximum for an opening angle b around 90°.  However we stress that determination of 

the exact optimal opening angle requires a study of TFs for more than four opening angles. 

We have previously21 performed 2D TF calculations on the same fiber tip geometry and we 

can  thus  directly  compare  the  amplitude  of  the  TFs  for  b  =  30°.    A  reasonable  qualitative 

correspondence is observed indicating that even though 3D computations are necessary to obtain 

the exact TF, fast 2D calculations may be useful to reveal its general shape. 

4.1. 

Resolving power 

 

9 

One of the motivations for calculating a TF is that it allows us to determine the resolving power 

of  a  SNOM  fiber  tip.    The  definition  of  resolution,  however,  depends  on  whether  the  optical 

fields distributions are limited in real space or in k-space. 

To introduce the concept of resolution for distributions limited in real space, we consider an 

electric  field  distribution  whose  x-  or  z-component  in  the  detection  plane  is  of  the  shape  of  a 

delta-function.  In the first case the in-plane field distribution is given by

  for  the  plane  wave  expansion  coefficients.   

0=(cid:215)(cid:209) E

  must  be 

satisfied  however,  so  the  z-component  of  the  electric  field  distribution  is  non-zero  and  can  be 

determined using Eq.  (2).  Secondly, when the z-component of  the  field  is a delta-function we 

have

, and this time the requirement 

0=(cid:215)(cid:209) E

 leads to a 

non-zero in-plane field.  As s-polarized waves do not contribute to the z-component of the field, 

we 

set

The calculated SNOM images for the delta-function distribution along the x-axis are shown 

in  Fig.  4a.    For  b  =  30°  the  SNOM  image  profile  features  a  near-Gaussian  shape,  but  for  the 

larger  opening  angles  we  generally  observe  an  oscillating  decay  along  the  x-axis.    This  is  not 

very surprising as the near-exponential decay of the TFs for

 serves as an effective cut-

off  and  we  can  thus  roughly  approximate  the  product

.    Making  the  Fourier  transform  we  obtain  a  sinc  function 

having the oscillating decay observed in Fig. 4a for opening angles of 60, 90 and 120 degrees. 

We  characterize  the  spatial  extent  of  the  imaged  spots  using  the  average  deviation  (AD) 

along the two axes given by

 along the x-axis, and the determined ADs

are presented in Table 1.  The smallest AD is obtained for b = 60° along the y-axis, however this 

opening  angle  also  features  the  largest  AD  along  the  x-axis  due  to  the  slow  oscillating  decay.  

The minimum AD along the x-axis is given for the b = 90° opening angle with an AD along the 

y-axis only slightly larger than that for b = 60°.  This behavior reflects the flatness of the TFs:  

The TF for b = 90° is rather broad and falls off slowly resulting in a wide step function giving a 

narrow sinc-like spot.  On the other hand, the  TF for b = 120° decreases  much faster, the step 

function is of shorter width and the resulting spot is wider. 

Fig.  4b  presents  the  SNOM  images  obtained  when  the  z-component  of  the  field  is  a  delta-

function.    The  images  preserve  the  rotational  symmetry  of  the

and we generally observe a donought-shaped profile.  We can understand the node at the origin 

by inspecting Eq. (5) for rotationally symmetric profiles 

( ^ksF

 and 

( ^kpF

)

.  In this case we

 and

 must thus equal 0.  AD values for the donought-shaped 

spots  are  given  in  Table  1  and,  as  previously,  the  narrower  profiles  are  obtained  for  opening 

angles of 60 and 90 degrees. 

We observe that the exact shape of the SNOM image of the delta-functions depends on the 

nature  of  the  TF.    The  shape  is  generally  not  of  Gaussian  form  and  this  complicates  the 

interpretation of an experimentally obtained SNOM image.  In the case where the x-component 

of the field is a delta-function, we have good one-to-one correspondence between delta-function 

and detected spot for b = 30°, but when b = 90° the two weaker spots neighboring the main spot 

can be mistaken for near-field point sources of weaker intensity.  When the z-component of the 

field is a delta-function the approximation of the images to Gaussian-shaped spots becomes even 

more  ambiguous.    We  conclude  that,  even  when  the  concept  of  resolution  is  introduced,  the 

identification of the SNOM image as the local electric field intensity is generally incorrect. 

 

11 

If  we  ignore  the  non-Gaussian  shape  of  the  imaged  spots,  we  can  roughly  define  the 

resolution of a SNOM tip as twice the AD values given in Table 1.  We note that the resolution 

limit defined here is related to the shape of the tip and is independent of noise. 

The  definition  of  resolution  described  above  is  meaningful  when  imaging  optical  field 

distributions limited in real space.  However, when imaging plane waves that can be considered 

point sources in k-space, the concept of resolution should be treated differently: 

In  previous  works24,25  the  resolution  of  SNOM  setups  was  determined  by  imaging  counter 

propagating waves.  Two such waves of identical spatial frequency and  amplitude propagating 

along  the  x-axis  and  decaying  along  the  z-axis  result  in  a  standing  wave  pattern  of  the  form

  of  1,  which,  without  background  noise,  would  be 

preserved  in  the  SNOM  image.    However,  for  increasing 

xk   and  thus  increasing 

zk   the 

calculated  TFs  show  us  that  the  standing  wave  pattern  intensity  in  the  image  decays  near-

exponentially,  and  when  it  approaches  the  background  noise  floor,  the  image  contrast  will 

deteriorate  and  the  limit  of  the  spatial  resolution  has  been  reached.    It  should  be  stressed  that, 

contrary to the previous case, the resolution limit when imaging a point-source in k-space is due 

to  background  noise:    The  coupling  coefficient  drops  exponentially  for  increasing  k,  but  it  is 

never zero.  Even though the fiber tip has a finite size, the image contrast would, without noise, 

be equal to 1 regardless of the value of the spatial frequency. 

Keeping the illumination intensity fixed and choosing a noise floor, resolutions of the various 

tips for the two polarizations can be extracted directly from Fig. 3 as the intersection of the TF 

curves with the noise floor.  Resolutions of the tips described in the figure are given in Table 2 

for (arbitrarily chosen) noise floors of 1 pW and 100 fW. 

 

12 

Obviously,  the  values  of  the  resolving  power  presented  here  depend  directly  on  the 

illumination  power  and  the  background  noise  floor,  but  relative  comparison  between  the 

resolutions  of  various  fiber  tips  can  still  be  made:    First,  the  resolutions  for  s-polarization  are 

slightly  better  than  those  for  p-polarized  light.    And  second,  we  observe  that  the  resolution  is 

generally improved with ~ 40 % when the noise floor is decreased from 1 pW to 100 fW.   

Whether  we  consider  point  sources  in  real  space  or  in  k-space,  the  best  resolution  is  not 

obtained for b = 30° as one might expect but rather for the large opening angle b = 90°.  The data 

show that if one is interested in improving the resolution of a SNOM microscope, one should not 

aim at producing a fiber tip with smallest opening angle possible. 

4.2. 

Effective plane of detection approximation 

In  an  effective  plane  of  detection  (EPD)  approximation21  the  coupling  of  the  near-field  to  the 

fiber  tip  with  apex  in  the  detection  plane  is  proportional  to  the  value  of  the  free-space  field 

produced in absence of tip a certain height h above the detection plane.  From 

kz

 we 

have  that

,  so  an  evanescent  wave  with  spatial  dependence  of  the  form 

exp(

ikr

z-

zk

)

 in the reference plane will have decayed by a factor ~ 

exp( kh-

)

 at the height h.  

We recognize this exponential decay as the near-linear regime in Fig. 3 of the TF curves plotted 

using semi-logarithmic scale for 

0 >kk

/

2

.  The coupling of the near-field to the fiber tip in this 

regime can thus be interpreted as coupling at an effective plane of detection positioned a distance 

h above the apex. 

However, for 

0 <kk

/

2

 the TF curves are not linear.  The EPD height h can still be defined 

but  it  should  then  be  a  function  of  k:    For  a  given  k,  we  solve  the  two  equations

, illustrated in Fig. 5, representing the local EPD height, near the spatial frequency k.  The 

function

 is highly non-uniform when 

0 <kk

/

2

 for both polarizations, and for p-polarized 

light we observe negative h values for opening angles of 30 and 60 degrees in the intervals where 

the  TFs  have  a  positive  slope.    When 

0 >kk

/

2

,  the  curves  are  nearly  independent  of  opening 

angle and, while still not constant, they vary much less than in the previous regime.  The curves 

are  generally  slowly  decreasing  with  average  value  of  ~  125  nm  for  both  polarizations  in  the 

interval 

2

kk

0 <

5.3

.    We  note  that  this  value  agrees  well  with  the  EPD  height  determined 

when comparing the experimental and modeled data of Ref. 17. 

The  EPD  approximation  which  assumes  a  k-independent  effective  plane  of  detection  is 

intuitively  appealing, but  Fig. 5 reveals that the  approximation is not ideal as it only  holds for 

spatial  frequency  components  of 

0 >kk

/

2

.    This  means  that  it  can  be  used  only  when  prior 

knowledge  of  the  field  distribution  is  available,  knowledge  that  allows  us  to  rule  out  the 

existence of components with 

0 <kk

/

2

.  Furthermore, even when restricting the approximation 

to 

0 >kk

/

2

, the effective detection height h is still not exactly constant but continues to decrease 

with k. 

In  many  experiments  however,  as  when  imaging  the  guided  modes  in  photonic  crystal 

structures7  or  the  propagation  of  surface  plasmon  polaritons,  the  spectrum  of  the  optical  field 

distribution is limited to a very narrow interval in k-space and light of only one polarization is 

present.    In  this  case  the  SNOM  image  does  indeed  reflect  the  intensity  distribution  in  an 

effective detection plane and, if knowledge of the average spatial frequency is available, the z-

coordinate of this plane can be determined from Fig. 5.

4.3. 

Fiber tip sharpness 

To examine the importance of employing a sharp fiber tip, we investigated the TFs of fiber tips 

of opening angle b = 90°, having their outer end cut off as illustrated in Fig. 6.  The detection 

plane is then raised to the end of the cut-off tip.  The TFs for varying tip cut-off diameters dt are 

illustrated in Fig. 7. 

For dt = 0 mm, nothing has been cut off and the TF is that of Fig. 3b for b = 90°.  For dt > 0 

mm the curves feature a complex oscillatory behavior.  However, for the dt (cid:1) 4 mm curves, the 

average power level is identical to or slightly better than that of the uncut tip.  This indicates that 

a perfectly sharp fiber tip results in a near-linear TF curve, where the EPD approximation may be 

used.    But,  surprisingly,  a  perfectly  sharp  tip  is  not  necessary  to  achieve  good  coupling  in  the 

evanescent regime.  For example, considering the detection of evanescent waves with relatively 

low  spatial  frequencies 

1

<

/
kk

0 <

5.2

,  the  tip  cut  with  dt  =  0.25  mm  is  notably  more  efficient 

than the sharp one and preferential over other cut tips due to a monotonous decay of the transfer 

function.   

However, we observe an overall drop in the power level when dt is increased beyond 4 mm.  

Also, for cut tips with dt above  ~ 1 mm we notice an improved coupling of propagating waves 

with 

/ kk

0

  below  ~  0.4.    The  amplification  of  propagating  modes  in  the  SNOM  image  is 

inconvenient as they will dominate over the evanescent field of interest.  We conclude that even 

though the tip need not be perfectly sharp, the conical part of the tapered fiber beyond dt = 1 mm 

improves the near-field image and should not be omitted. 

5.  Discussion 

 

15 

The  fact  that  arbitrarily  small  field  variations  are  not  observed  in  the  SNOM  image  can  be 

roughly understood by introducing the concept of resolution, where the TF is considered a step-

function, constant for 

k

/2p<

r

, where r is the resolution limit, and zero otherwise. The SNOM 

images of delta-functions, however, demonstrate that the SNOM image does not faithfully depict 

the optical field intensity and that the concept of resolution cannot alone explain the field-image 

relation. 

From  the  calculated  TFs  it  is  clear  that,  in  the  evanescent  regime,  the  curves  are  better 

approximated to an exponential decay characteristic for an effective plane of detection above the 

tip  apex  than  to  the  constant  obtained,  if  the  field  was  effectively  coupled  at  the  very  apex.  

Unfortunately,  the  EPD  approximation  is  only  valid  for  perfectly  sharp  fiber  tips  in  certain 

spatial frequency regimes. 

The limitations of the  concept of  resolution and of the EPD approximation suggest that, to 

interpret the SNOM image correctly, a more general approach is needed:  We can consider the 

SNOM  image  detected  for  a  given  optical  field  as  the  result  of  operating  on  the  field  with  a 

coupling operator  Hˆ .  If this operator is invertible, we can operate with its inverse 

1ˆ -H  on the 

SNOM image to obtain the optical field.  From Eq. (5) we observe that, in the general case, the 

operator  Hˆ   is  invertible  if  the  complex  functions 

( ^rxA

)

  and 

( ^ryA

)

  are  known  and  we  thus 

require  that  our  SNOM  microscope  can  detect  phase  and  power  of  the  two  linearly  polarized 

guided  modes  (

)y
x AA ,

 individually.  If this is possible, the components of the optical field are 

given by the inverse Fourier transform of Eq. (5):

  and  we  have  prior  knowledge  of  the  functions 

)(kH s

 and

.  If the field is uniform along the y-axis, the integrals in Eq. (7) vanish for 

angles q  different from 0 (mod p) and the polarizations are separated.  In this particular case we 

can reconstruct the field without individual measurements of 

( ^rxA

)

 and 

( ^ryA

)

. 

Theoretically, the functions 

)(kH s

 and 

)(kH p

 can be completely arbitrary.  In practice there 

will  be  noise  present  and  we  cannot  use  the  inversion  of  Eq.  (7)  for  spatial  frequencies  that 

couple to power levels below the noise floor.  To overcome the  limitation to resolution  due to 

noise,  a  nano-collector  with  a  near-constant  amplitude  of  the  TF  is  preferred:    With  a  near-

constant  amplitude,  a  weak  propagating  background  field  will  not  be  amplified  in  the  SNOM 

image  compared  to  field  components  of  high  spatial  frequency,  and  the  evanescent  field  of 

interest can then be studied.  

6.  Conclusion 

When  working  with  uncoated  fiber  tips,  the  detected  SNOM  image  only  represents  the  optical 

field intensity distribution in an effective detection plane in a few particular cases.  In general, an 

inversion  operation  must  be  performed  to  reconstruct  the  optical  field.    This  reconstruction 

requires exact knowledge of the transfer function of the fiber tip and the capability to measure 

phase and power of the two orthogonal modes of the single-mode fiber individually.   

To extend the achievable resolution, not only good coupling but also a flat amplitude of the 

transfer  function,  is  preferred.    Our  simulations  indicate  that  for  uncoated  fiber  tips  at  the 

wavelength of 633 nm, a tip having a ~ 90° degree opening angle is the optimal choice.  The tip 

 

17 

can be sharp, but an equally good coupling is obtained for a cut-off tip with diameter dt up to 1

Abstract

ANOXIA,   treatment   by   oxygen   deprivation   is   largely   used   for   decontamination   and
disinfestation of cellulose and protein-based organic materials. More specifically this method
is applied to more than one hundred thousand of objects destinated for a new museum  in
Paris,  "Musee  du Quai  Branly".  We  describe  the  anoxia  installation  in  this  museum  and
report the result of a study regarding the efficiency of this method and the optimum treatment
time, crucial for treating a large collection. We show that the standard 21 days of exposure is
not always the optimal choice. Temperature  plays a crucial role for hastening the death of
insects  found  within   objects.   At   a   temperature   of   25°C,   it   is   entirely   possible   to   reduce
exposure times to 10 or 15 days for the insect species commonly found in museums.  The
oxygen drop times is between 1 and 2 days for most objects, depending on type and porosity
of materials. This corresponds to a treatment  time between 15 and 16 days. The effect of
humidity  is less clear. It can increase the necessary treatment time both for larvae and for
adult insects.

INTRODUCTION

A large part of the collection of the future Musée du quai Branly - currently under
construction near the Eiffel Tower in Paris -   is composed of cellulose   and protein-based
organic   materials.   Such   materials   are   favourable   media   for   the   development   of   micro-
organisms and insects, leading to their degradation.

This collection is presently being treated in a series of steps which include cleaning,
the   taking   of   photographs,   packaging   and   biological   decontamination   in   the   Le   Berlier
building which has been especially equipped for this purpose.

The   collection   of   the   Musée   du   quai   Branly,   numbering   about   275000   objects1,
comprises   on   the   one   hand   collections   from   the   Musée   National   des   Arts   d’Afrique   et
d’Océanie (MNAAO) and the Musée de l’Homme (MH), and on the other hand has been
enriched by new acquisitions. 

Studies   of   the   general   state   of   conservation   of   these   collections   in   their   original
institutions by experts, demonstrated the existence of infestation by Anobiidae, Dermestidae
and Tineidae, to name just a few. Infestation was found to be more or less serious depending
on the  institution  and departments  in question.  Given  that  it  is difficult to reconstruct an
accurate case history of the infestation and the steps that have been taken to counter it, it was
decided   to   proceed   with   treatment   of   all   objects   containing   organic   materials,   without
exception.

This prudent choice was made in view of the fact that the treated objects were not
destined to return to the site from which they came, but were going to be housed in a new
museum: a « complete overhaul » of the objets in order to reduce the level infestation to zero
is   advisable   under   such   circumstances. Furthermore,   the   objects   are   treated   by   oxygen
deprivation   (anoxia),   which   minimises   the   risk   of   chemical   degradation,   althought   some
discolorations of some pigments  have been reported (TOSHICO, K., 1980); this cannot be said of
classical fumigation treatments even though the treatment times are much shorter in the latter
cases. 

Heritage institutions currently employ oxygen deprivation treatment times (Tt) of 21 days.
This duration appears to have been adopted in the light of the results of experiments carried
out   on   a   particularly   resistant   species,   the   rice   weevil,   an   important   pest   in   the  food
industry :  500 hours (21 days) at 26°C, 12%  relative humidity, in a nitrogen atmosphere
containing   1%   oxygen.   The   exposure   time   is   extended   to   1000   hours   (6   weeks)   if   the
temperature is lowered to 20°C (SELWITZ, C. et al, 1998). 

Of more relevance in the museum field, the old house borer, Hylotrupes bajulus, is also a
species resistant to treatment by oxygen deprivation. Its favourite medium is resinous wood.
Eradication of this insect necessitated  20 days in somewhat  different conditions: 20°C and
40% relative humidity. The duration can be reduced to 10 days if the temperature is raised to
30°C (VALENTIN, N., 1993).

It   has   gradually   become   standard   practice   to   use   a   treatment   time   of   21   days.   The
recommended conditions are in general  as follows:  less than 0.1% oxygen, a temperature
above 20°C and relative humidity of 50%. 

1

 The exact  number will be established at the end of the collection treatment programme

2

There are a very large number of objects to be treated (more than 80% of the collection).
The deadline for completion of the collection treatment programme  leads to constraints, in
view of which time is of the essence. It is therefore appropriate to analyse the time given to
each stage of the object treatment process in order that none be wasted.

If a reduction in the duration of oxygen deprivation treatment turns out to be possible, this
would enable a good speed to be maintained during the progress of the collection treatment
programme.

Consequently the key conclusion awaited from this study is the answer to the following

question: is the anoxia treatment efficient for an exposure time less than 21 days ?

Each anoxic treatment installation has its own characteristics. Thus, since the installation
we  have  used,  named   EPMQB   (named  according  the  name  of   the   musée,   Etablissement
Public   Musée   du   quai   Branly2),   was   specially   designed   for   the   Musée   du   quai   Branly
treatment   site,   and   was   of   a   new   and   as   yet   untried   form   in   the   field   of   heritage   and
conservation, it was necessary  to carry out a study in order to optimize the conditions of
treatment for objects, in particular as regards oxygen drop times and exposure times.

The feasibility of treating infested museum objects by oxygen deprivation, either through
the use of oxygen scavengers, or in a controlled atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen
(N2) or argon (Ar)) or carbon dioxide (CO2) is now well established. Resistant species such as
H. bajulus or A. punctatum (cellulose) can be totally eradicated, and this is also possible in
the case where insects are at the egg or larval stage which renders them more resistant to
treatment (Rust, M. et al, 1996 ; Selwitz, C. ; Maekawa, S., 1998). Many studies have already
been   carried   out   by   teams   in   the   USA   (Getty   Conservation   Institute)   and   Australia
(Australian Museum) for exemple. These studies have enabled the evaluation of influence of
different parameters, such as the level of oxygen (O2), temperature and relative humidity, on
the exposure times needed to achieve 100% mortality whatever the life cycle stage of   the
insects.

Therefore, the goal of the study is to determine the efficiency of the EPMQB equipment
and the effectiveness  of the traitement  in the case of insects buried deep within an object.
This phase of the study should enable the degree to which oxygen is removed from the inside
of treated objects to be evaluated.

We report and discuss results obtained in the following areas :

1) the exposure time, Te, in the new EPMQB installation, leading to 100% mortality
irrespective of life cycle  stage  of    the  insects present  in    infested objects. The treatment
conditions are based on previous literature reports. They must be optimized from a mortality
viewpoint whilst avoiding endangering at the same time the physical structure of the treated
objects: an atmosphere with highly reduced oxygen content is used, between 1000vpm and
30vpm, a temperature of 25°C– 1°C and hygrometry of 50%– 5%. 

2) the oxygen drop time, Ti

33, defined as being the time taken to lower the oxygen

content in the treatment  unit to the required level  (0.1 %), and to study the effect of the
degree of loading with museum objects.

3) the oxygen desorption time of the objects Td. The Td value depends intrinsically on
the nature of the materials and the volume of the objects to be treated and the volume of the

anoxia chamber. The Td  varies as a function of the permeability of the materials to gases, i.e.
nitrogen and oxygen in this case.

A - PROGRESS IN OXYGEN DEPRIVATION TREATMENT: MAIN RESULTS
OBTAINED BY OTHER INSTITUTIONS

I-TESTS   ON   INSECTS:   EXPOSURE   TIMES   AND   CLIMATIC   CONDITIONS   OF
TREATMENT

The experiments carried out cover a very wide range of insects at all life cycle stages, i.e.
eggs, larvae, nymphs  and adult insects. Atmospheres were modified through the use of the
three most frequently used gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen (N2) and argon (Ar). The
anoxia treatment was performed in bubble chambers (VALENTIN, N.,1994; RUST, K. et al., 1996).
In some cases in order to simulate  their being buried, insects were prepared in glass tubes
closed by a system allowing gaseous  exchange. The tubes were subsequently left fixed within
blocks  of  wood.  Other   experiments   were  with  sections  of   pine   wood  and with  books   of
dimensions which were artificially infested with the insects to be studied. The main results
show that :

           - the most resistant life cycle stages of insects are eggs and larvae;

- not all the insects react in the same way, the old house borer is the most resistant;
- the treatment is more effective with argon than with nitrogen;
- temperature is an important factor whatever the other conditions.

The exposure time is reduced when the temperature increases; for example in the case of
H.   bajulus  (old   house   borer),   when   the   temperature   increases   from   20°C   to   40°C,   the
exposure time is reduced from 21 days to 2 days.  The studies carried out in  the museum
environment  show   exposure   times   much   lower   than   the   standard   of   21   days   when   the
climatic conditions  are  chosen  appropriately,  including  for the  most  resistant  species;  for
example :

-

-

-

for the Anobiidae
     (e.g. : furniture beetle), complete elimination was achieved after  3
 
or 5 days with 50% relative humidity, 30°C et 0.03% oxygen. One exception to this
range   has   been   reported;  this   is   Lasioderma   serricorne   (cigarette   beetle),   which
required  8 days  at 25°C with 50 % relative humidity, or  9 days  at 20°C and 40 %
relative humidity. (VALENTIN, N., 1993);

for  Hylotrupes   bajulus  (old   house   borer)   of   the  Cerambycidae  family,   which   has
shown itself to be rather more resistant, the exposure time was 10 days at 30°C with
40 % relative humidity or 20 days at 20 °C. (VALENTIN, N., 1993);

for the Tineidae (e.g. clothes moths), 4 days at  25.5°C, 55% relative humidity and an
oxygen level below 0.1 % have been reported (RUST et al, 1996).

More recently in 2000, a Japanese team proposed a practical protocol for anoxia treatment
according to the type of insect. They advise 25°C or 30°C for one to three weeks. When the
temperature is 20°C exposure time should be extended to 10 weeks with an oxygen level of

4

0.2%. In evidence, in this case the high level of the oxygen makes the treatment time longer
than in the previous experiments (KIGAWA, R. et al, 2000).

The experimental parameters  for treatment, according to the infestation, are actually
well known. The key questions which now remain to be answered are whether or not the
experimental conditions are really achieved within the treated objects. 

II-DEMONSTRATION OF OXYGEN DESORPTION OF TREATED OBJECTS

The   results   outlined   above   were   obtained   by   simulating   the   burial   of   insects   within
objects in order to mimic as closely as possible a real situation. However, it is difficult from a
technical point of view to directly evaluate the desorption time Td  of oxygen from objects,
since to do this would in principle necessitate the positioning of detectors within the objects.
Td depends on the porosity of the objects studied, and on the permeability of the materials to
the gas used. The duration of treatment therefore depends on the desorption time. Various
methods were  used to evaluate  desorption such  as  calculation of the time  needed  for the
oxygen level to reach its equilibrium value, and comparison of the treatment times of infested
objects with the treatment times of reference samples.

II-1 calculation of the  time needed for equilibrium to be reached.

Simulation was carried out with fresh, non-infested wood from different sources: poplar,
oak, walnut,  having fixed dimensions. The wood samples  were bare or covered by a thick
protective   coat.   They   were   enclosed   in   a   pocket   of   volume   32   litres   (0.032m3)   until
equilibrium was reached. The initial experimental conditions were: 
23°C, 0.1% to 0.2% oxygen. Equilibrium was reached with 0.4% oxygen. Oxygen desorption
was found to be more difficult with painted wood than bare wood. The difficulty increase in
the way poplar, oak, walnut, with a maximum desorption time of 120 hours (5 days).
The same experimentrepeated for  infested walnut wood showed a shorter desorption time:
equilibrium was reached more quickly, in one hour for the bare wood and in 4 hours for the
painted   wood.   This  result   is   a  consequence   of   the   greater   porosity   of   infested   wood   in
comparison to healthy wood on account of the tunnels hollowed out by the infesting insects
(SELWITZ, C., 1998).

II-2 Comparison of treatment time of infested objects with treatment time of reference
samples (test samples)

Treatments carried out  on museum  objects  using readily  available  test  samples  as
references and performed in a controlled argon atmosphere  showed similar exposure times
for the objects and the reference samples, the differences in exposure times being one day or
less. 

This result was not always observed. Wooden objects (pianos, sculpture and panels of
wood) infested by Anobium punctatum (furniture beetle) had to be treated over 10 to 14 days,
compared to only 4 for the reference samples.  Similarly, 7 days were needed for a textile
sample of dimensions 135x87x43cm infested by Attagenus megatoma (black carpet beetle) as
compared to 2 days for the corresponding reference sample. The treatment conditions were as

5

follows : a temperature above 20°C, relative humidity of  40 % to 50 % and an oxygen level
of  0.02-0.04% (VALENTINN, N., 1993).

Other experiments performed on powderpost beetle and termites buried in the heart of
the   wood   and   sealed   and   in   other   cases   non-sealed   (more   accessible)   did   not   show   any
difference in exposure times (RUST, KENNEDY, 1993).

III- DETERMINATION OF TREATMENT TIMES FOR WOODEN OBJECTS

The results below (table 1) were obtained for large objects infested by A. punctatum

B -THE STUDY CARRIED OUT AT THE MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY 

The   bibliography   cited   above   shows   that   the   most   resistant   insect   developmental
stages   are   eggs   and   larvae;   adults   and   nymphs   are   the   first   to   be   affected   by   oxygen
deprivation.  Hylotrupes bajulus  (common name: old house borer), has turned out to be the
species   most   resistant   to   oxygen   deprivation   treatment.   This   insect   is   however   not   very
commonly encountered in museum  objects. It is generally found instead in resinous wood
structures  of buildings.  It was  nonetheless  chosen for the present  study on account  of its
resistance. This insect was also readily available, being bred prior to this study at the Centre
Technique   du   Bois   et   de   l’Ameublement,   CTBA   (Technical   Center   for   Wood   and
Furnishings).

At the same time as carrying out experiments on the insects, other experiments were
performed in order to evaluate oxygen desorption times from the materials used, the degree to
which the oxygen content within the materials  was lowered  and the effect  of the type of
objects loaded on the oxygen drop time.

5) An   oxygen   level   control   unit   including:   A   Xentra   oxygen   trace   analyser   for   the

containers, two OLDHAM oxygen detectors for the area. 

I-1-2  System operation

The technique  chosen for oxygen deprivation is a dynamic  system  based on a continuous
flow of nitrogen through the enclosed treatment units. The nitrogen used is prepared from the
air in the room. The nitrogen is separated from the oxygen by the molecular sieve system.
The nitrogen is stored in a series of reservoirs. Oxygen is desorbed from the molecular sieves
under the pressure of nitrogen. 

Treatment  protocols are entered by keyboard and recorded in a computer  file reserved for
these  data: degree  of humidity:  50%, exposure  time:14  days,  level  of oxygen: 1000 vpm
(0.1%). These values can be changed. The temperature of the enclosed treatment units is the
same as that of the surrounding area, e.g. 25°C.The humidification of the enclosed treatment
units is performed through the humidification of the nitrogen. 

There are three steps to the treatment cycle:

1) a purging phase of the enclosed units called "INJECTION GAZ 1" and "INJECTION

GAZ 2", which reduce the oxygen level  to below 0.1%;

2) a treatment phase with an oxygen level below 0.1%, called "CONTACT GAZ";

3) a “rinsing” out phase : the oxygen level is raised to 20% by sucking in air from the
room, called "RINÇAGE",  followed by the end of the treatment  cycle, called "FIN
TRAITEMENT". 

The   oxygen   drop   times   depend   on   the   volume   of   the
enclosed treatment units and on the nature of the objects
loaded within them.

As a matter of definition, the exposure time Te, is considered to start once the oxygen level
has decreased to 0.1% at beginning of the phase called "CONTACT GAZ".

All the  parameters  are  recorded  and stored  in files  which  can  be accessed using Excel.
Averages are calculated on the basis of these data. At the end of a treatment cycle, a report is
produced. The latter displays the dates and times of the following events: beginning of the
treatment, moment when oxygen level reaches 0.1% (called "CONTACT GAZ"), end of the
treatment.

Curves of parameters  throughout the cycle of treatment

I-2 Looking for the proper exposure time: experiments on insects

Four  series  of experiments  were performed  with  Hylotrupes bajulus  at egg  and larval
stages with the aim of determining the lowest exposure time. Each series was composed of
three experiments with identical treatment times. The eggs are placed on blotting paper and
conditioned in Petri dishes. Larvae are placed in small wooden blocks and enclosed in Petri
dishes.

Each experiment  was carried out in the following manner : three egg test samples  and
three larvae test samples were placed in the oxygen deprivation sealed unit. One reference
egg test sample and one reference larvae test sample were left in the atmosphere of the area
outside the enclosed treatment units. The first series were treated using an exposure time Te
of 10 days. This is the shortest time given in the existing literature. After the experiments, the
test  samples  were  put  back in steamroom  for 15 days. The % mortality  arising  from the
oxygen deprivation treatment can then be calculated after counting dead eggs and larvae and
also survivors. Results are shown in table 2

In the case of series 4, samples conditioned  in Petri boxes were enclosed in sealed plastic

boxes to mimic the deep burying of insects.

The lowest exposure time at 25°C, 50% RH, with an oxygen level below 0.1% is 7 days 

I-3 Oxygen drop times Ti and desorption time Td in the treatment unit
These  values  were  calculated in the   following  manner,  based on the automatic  treatment
report :

Ti = (time at which oxygen level of 0.1% is reached, called "CONTACT GAZ") - (time of
beginning of treatment).

Desorption times Td  are determined by comparing the Ti  observed when the containers are
loaded with objects to be treated with the Ti observed when the containers are empty

Td = Ti (loaded unit) - Ti (empty unit)

The Ti and Td averages were calculated on the basis of six loadings. The load is analysed,
batch   by   batch   and   object   by   object,   using   TMS   (The   Museum   System)   files,   where
information   concerning   the   materials   of   which   the   objects   are   made,   as   well   as   their
dimensions and weight, are recorded. 

It appears possible to infer from the composition of the different loads that a load made up
principally of wooden objects or wooden object and textile or skins,   requires a priori a
longer oxygen drop time than a load of wood and vegetal pulp or vegetal fibres. However
differences in the space occupied by objects appeared to be the dominant factor. When the
volume of the closed treatment units is most effectively filled, the oxygen drop time is longer. 

In contrast, it became clear that the sealed treatment  units A and C, which  each  have a
volume of 35 m3, reach the stage called "CONTACT GAZ" (oxygen level reduced to 900vpm)
after a day and a half whereas the treatment unit B, having a volume of 25 m3, only required
one day.

II-Demonstration of the diffusion of nitrogen 

II-1 Through the wrapping

Diffusion   of   nitrogen   has   been   demonstrated   by   comparison   of   the   oxygen   level   in   a
cardboard box with the oxygen level in the sealed treatment unit.

The   same   phenomenon   of   equilibrium,   here   concerning   oxygen   concentration,   occurs
between the treatment unit and the treated objects. Splits, cracks, tunnels dug out by insects,
and natural micropores in the wood can be seen as analogous to the opeining cut out in the
cardboard box. 

In order to study how oxygen concentrations vary within treated objects, a simulation
was carried out. Two wooden cases were used5, one in pine and the other in laminated wood,
which  is  less  porous.  Both had an interior volume  of about  3 litres.  Such  a volume  is a
prerequisite for the removal of air samples for later analysis. The pine case had a thickness of
7 cm all around the empty internal space. The laminated wood case had a thickness of  1 cm.

II-2 Demonstration of the degree of oxygen reduction within objects : experiments on gas
diffusion simulation with wooden cases 

The degree of oxygen reduction within objects was studied through experiments carried

out in treatment unit A which is equipped with two probes for measuring oxygen levels. 

• Test 1: Carried out on a pine case of internal volume 3.1 litres and of thickness 7 cm. 
The valve (V2) linking the case to the oxygen-analyser was disconnected at the beginning of
the experiment so as not to interfere with gaseous exchange (of nitrogen and oxygen). The
other valve (V1), which enables oxygen levels to be measured in the treatment unit, remained
connected to the oxygen-analyser. 

                                                  

Three days after the beginning of the treatment cycle, V2 was connected. The oxygen level
inside the box was measured after having calibrated the oxygen-analyser  with the nitrogen
produced. The oxygen level was 0.0337% (337 vpm).

Five days after, the oxygen level was 0.0010 % (10 vpm).

• Test 2: carried out on a pine case during a test of unit A (a) when not loaded with

We interpret the slight increase of the oxygen level after around 2 hours to be due to
injection  of oxygen  from  objects inside the treatment  unit:  due  to extraction of gas,    the
partial pressure of oxygen in the treatment  unit becomes smaller than the oxygen pressure
inside  the  porous  material  of  objects  under treatment,   consequently  oxygen   begins  to  be
extracted from objects and for a short time a increase in oxygen level is observed. However as
the   volume   of   the   oxygen   inside   the   pores   is   very   limited,   the   effect   is   small   and   will
disappear quickly and the exponential decrease of oxygen take over again. 
This observation is very important because it proves in this process that not only nitrogen
diffuses in the porous material but also the latter loses its oxygen which helps to kill larvae
buried deep inside objects.

14

These figures show that the drop of oxygen depends not only on the time but also on
the porosity of materials and on the size of the objects. The different data observed as regards
desorption   times,   all   suggest   that   oxygen   desorption   is   rapid   with   the   EPMQB   anoxia
installation. Thus, eradication of H. bajulus, old house borer, requires a shorter exposure time
than those described in the literature: 7 days as compared to 10 days, in a reduced oxygen
atmosphere   (less   than   0.1%)   with   a     temperature   around   25°C   and   about   50%   relative
humidity. 

Desorption times of 10 to 13 hours are achieved, for all the enclosed treatment units
used, for a target oxygen level of 0.09%. Desorption is concurrent with the oxygen drop in
the sealed treatment unit so that when the stage called "CONTACT GAZ" is reached, the same
conditions are reached within the most materials,  as is confirmed by test 2 (a). For the less
porous ones, "CONTACT GAZ" is reached 1 or 2 days later. Homogenization  between the
sealed treatment  unit and the cardboard packing box is achieved after 4 hours. This means
that during the 9 remaining hours (13-4), evacuation of oxygen from the most inaccessible
spaces in the unit is taking place, e.g. in side the objects.

III-DISCUSSION

The tests on insects and the tests of gas diffusion cannot be performed on real objects.
Only   simulations   are   possible.   Such   simulations   must   be   as   close   as   possible   to   a   real
treatment situation or mimic the most difficult situations likely to be encountered. To this
end, we decided to leave closed Petri dishes in the treatment unit, placing them in cardboard
boxes under silk paper. 

For the same reasons, the boxes used as models for objects to be treated during the
diffusion studies either had a thickness (7 cm) greater than generally found for objects to be
treated or a thickness close to that of treated objects but less permeable (laminated wood, or
wrapped with plastic film).

In these artificial but tough conditions, it appears reasonable to extrapolate the results,
in so far as the results obtained are reproducible and agree with those known in the literature.
These conditions appear to have been satisfied, our results being constant. 

The   conditions   leading   to   the   death   of   insects   are   now   well   known;   they   are
inescapable   and   in   no   doubt   from   a   scientific   point   of   view.   According   to   the   type   of
equipment used,  these  mortal  conditions  are  attained within  treated objects  after  variable
amounts of time. Treatment stricto sensu only begins when those conditions are reached.

In the case of the EPMQB installation, the desorption phenomenon is observed both
by an increase in the oxygen level in the curve showing the evolution of oxygen levels over
time and in an indirect way by comparing  the oxygen drop times of empty treatment  units
with those  of loaded treatment  units.  The longer oxygen  drop  times  observed  for  loaded
treatment   units   are   not   simply   a   consequence   of   the   modifications   in   gas   circulation   on
account of large obstacles (trolleys, boxes), but also result from the phenomenon of oxygen
desorption. 

We  consider that  in our  system  we  have  a  binary mixture, nitrogen and oxygen.
Hydrosoluble pollutants such as CO2 and SO2 are essentially eliminated with the water in the

15

desiccator.   Water   vapour   is   constant   and   does   not   therefore   influence   gaseous   O2/N2
exchange. The parameters  of   temperature  and pressure are  far removed  from  conditions
necessary   for   the   liquefaction   of   gases.   It   is   therefore   reasonable   to   consider   the   O2/N2
mixture as a perfect gas. The mixture thus obeys the perfect gas law PV = nRT (P=pressure,
V=volume, n= number of moles , R= perfect gas constant, T= temperature in Kelvin). The
process,  although  dynamic,  can be split  up into a series  of equilibrium  states established
between the bulk volume of the sealed treatment units and the boxes (or objects). Following
Lechâtelier's principle, a system in equilibrium moves from one equilibrium state to another
equilibrium state in such a way as to compensate for any perturbation imposed upon it. Here,
the perturbation is the disappearance of oxygen from the sealed treatment unit.

When a substance disappears, the equilibrium shifted in such a way as to favour the

appearance of that substance: 

Treatment unit   N2+O2                               N2 +O2 Box (or object)

When oxygen levels drop in the treatment unit, the equilibrium is shifted in direction 1 so as
to equalize oxygen concentrations.

Treatment unit N 2 + O2                                   N2 + O2 Box (or object)

The treatment unit – cardboard box equilibrium also enables us to study the progress of the
levels of nitrogen and oxygen.

P  is  the  total  pressure  in  the  treatment   unit,  and  is  close  to   atmospheric  pressure.  It  is
recorded   periodically   by   an   automatic   measuring   device.   The   partial   pressures   are
calculated using the law of perfect gases. The partial pressure of oxygen in the cardboard
box is 4.5 times greater than the partial pressure of oxygen in the treatment unit. Oxygen
molecules thus naturally move in the direction cardboard box-treatment unit. 

Modelling of nitrogen diffusion in porous objects enables the extrapolation of the findings
from this study to other materials and the prediction the oxygen desorption time according to
the material type (e.g. wood, feather, skin, etc.) and the size of the objects and the estimation
of the effectiveness of anoxia at the core of  a treated object.  We consider  the  dispersion
media to be constructed from a series of microscopic connected tubes through which the fluid
passes and disperses (BEAR, J. 1963).  The duration for passing through each micro-tube is
random as well as the number of tubes visited by a tracer to arrive to a given depth in the
media. The distribution of passage time through N tubes for large N is Gaussian:

C0 is fluid density at contact surface;  ?t is a delay time that fluid spends in a tube before it
begins its dispersion, t  is the characteristic dispersion time which depends on the microscopic
interactions and viscosity of the fluid. Defining an average tube length:

 

distribution (1) changes to: 

For ?t = 0, (2) is simplified to:

When t/t  >> 0, (5) is a Gaussian with      

17

All the microscopic phenomena are concentrated in the quantity:

which must be determined experimentally. For the simple geometry we have considered here
i.e. a media with infinite volume and infinite contact surface with fluid, ?2 is proportional to
x, the dispersion depth. For a finite object the dependence must be more complicated  and
should also depend on the dimensions. Nonetheless, the test with a box (Fig. 3) shows that at
least  for  relatively  large  objects Gaussian  distribution is  very good fit.  Dependence  on  x
however must be verified experimentally.

This calculation will enable us to predict the oxygen desorption time within the objects

according to material (e.g. wood, feather, skin) and the size of objects and establish the
effectiveness of anoxia at the core of a treated object. 

Another key question is  whether the treatment conditions chosen enable the eradication
of any mutant insects present which may have become resistant to oxygen deprivation.

Several workers in the field have already looked into the question of whether insects can
adapt to modified atmospheres with very low oxygen content. They have shown that it is not
impossible for insects to survive without oxygen but this is very rare, and encountered above
all in the case of aquatic insects having water or ice habitats, for example certain small flies
living in water. The latter are able to resist more than 100 days in the absence of oxygen by
slowing   down   their   respiration,   increasing   the   amount   of   stored   oxygen   and   also   by   a
physiological change which allows them to avoid drying out. In very humid conditions, even
in a reduced oxygen atmosphere, desiccation, the primary cause of death for insects, does not
occur (ZEBE, E. 1991).

However, in conditions which are far removed from aquatic conditions, such as in the food
industry, or  in heritage  institutions,  such  an  adaptation is unlikely  given  that  the  relative
humidity   is   much   lower.   Resistance   may   arise   in   the   case   of   insects   which   develop   in
confined   and   very   humid   spaces   where   the   oxygen   concentration   is   low   and   the   carbon
dioxide concentration is high, or with insects buried inside books or wood. A known example
is that of  L. serricorne, the cigarette beetle.  In such a case, it is sufficient to lengthen  the
exposure time (SELWITZ, C., 1998).

18

A study  of the resistance  of  Tribolium castaneum  (Red flour beetle)  to a reduced oxygen
atmosphere was carried out using the following conditions: 0.5% oxygen in nitrogen, or  20%
oxygen and 15% nitrogen in carbon dioxide with   95% relative humidity, these conditions
being maintained until only 30 to 50% of the insects were still alive. The surviving insects
were bred for 40 generations in the same conditions. This study showed that these insects
were only resistant towards the specific atmosphere to which they had been subjected. Insects
returned to normal air after 13 generations displayed continuing resistance for 8 generations.
The authors of this study considered that adaptation  to atmospheres  modified with carbon
dioxide  is  more  likely   to  occur  than  in  the   case   of   modification  with  other  gases.   More
recently, in 2001, HOBACK and STANLEY studied several microhabitats where insects are
under hypoxia or anoxia such as stored grain or decaying wood. In such conditions insects
reduce their respiration  rates when  the  oxygen  level  reached 10 %. Certain insects  as  C.
vomitoria  larvae   can   survive   at   1  %   only   5-6  days.   However,  in  general,   insects   cannot
withstand an oxygen level of 0.5 % for a long period of time.

It would not be realistic to consider that the simple fact of subjecting aerobic insects to

an anoxic environment is sufficient to make them become anaerobic s pecies. 

The   rice   weevil,   whose   resistance   seems   to   have   given   rise   to   the   standardized
treatment time of three weeks, is an important pest in the agricultural industry. This insect is
not among those frequently encountered in museums. In museums, the insect population
is essentially composed of Anobiidae, Dermestidae, Tineidae, and other families such as the
Lyctidae and Lepismatidae (MAEKAWA,  S., 1998,  PINNINGER,  D.).   These insects are much less
resistant to oxygen deprivation treatment  as is indicated by the results of studies involving
them. 

CONCLUSION

The conclusions we draw after the study carried out with the EPMQB installation are
based both on the results of teams abroad working in this field and on our observations at the
Musée du quai Branly. 

Temperature   plays   a   crucial   role   for   hastening   the   death   of   insects   found   within
objects. Thus, at a temperature of 25°C, it is entirely possible to reduce exposure times to 10
or 15 days for the insect species commonly found in museums.

The role played  by humidity  is less clear-cut in spite  of the fact that the principal

mechanism leading to insect mortality is desiccation, both for larvae and for adult insects.

In view of the results obtained with the EPMQB installation and also in view of those
recorded in the relevant literature for tests on reference samples and on real objects  (such as
the   results   of   the   Getty   Conservation   Institute),   and   taking   account   of   the   experimental
conditions (temperature,  relative  humidity, oxygen levels)  we  can move as  of now to  an
exposure time (Te)  of 14 days (2 weeks). 

The oxygen drop times (Ti) being situated between 1 and 2 days for most objects, this

corresponds to a treatment time Tt between 15 and 16 days. 

Tt = Ti + Te

In parallel with the treatment of objects, the rigorous hygiene monitoring programme
put in place on the collection treatment site will enable any new infestation to be detected.

19

For   this   monitoring   programme,   the   Musée   du   Quai   Branly   has   called   in   specialists   in
tackling   infestation.   The   hygiene   monitoring   programme   involves   the   setting   up   of
pheromone and baited traps and these traps are renewed every three months. 

A programme of harvesting and identification of insects has also been initiated. A list of all
the   insects   found   dead   or   alive,   in   the   treatment   sites   or   on   objects   is   kept   by   the
Cleaning/Dusting   Department   and   transmitted   to   the   Anoxia   Department,   who   are
responsible for identification, performed in collaboration with the company Hygiène-Office
and the Laboratoire d'Entomologie du Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle6.

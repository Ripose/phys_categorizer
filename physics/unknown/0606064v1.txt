Abstract 
We analyse, following recent work of Roehner, changes in house prices for both the UK 
and Ireland. We conclude that prices in the UK/ London have reached a tipping point and 
house prices relative are set to fall over the next few years. If inflation does not rise then 
a hard landing seems likely. House prices in Ireland are shown to have broken away from 
the moderate rise still to found in Northern Ireland and Dublin has emerged as another 
global ‘hot’ spot. An evolution similar to that in London can be anticipated

Introduction 
House prices are of concern to many people and at present they seem to be going through 
one  of  the  periodic  up  turns.  The  Financial  Times  of  May  7,  2006  carried  on  the  front 
page the headline: ‘Property Bonanza in Central London’ and noted that ‘a mini-boom is 
sweeping the most exclusive streets of London where house prices have risen by 14.5% 
in a year.’ On a different page of the same newspaper there was a rather more cautionary 
announcement:  repossession  orders  were  now  at  their  highest  level  since  the  previous 
peak that occurred as property prices were falling in the early 1990’s.  
 
In Dublin house prices that have risen albeit slowly for many decades have been rising 
very  quickly  since  1997.  One  commentator  recently  reported  that  ‘Frenzy’  in  the  Irish 
property  market  has  intensified.  In  the  last  six  months,  house  price  inflation  has 
accelerated to an annual rate of 15%. In Dublin, prices are rising at annual rate of 20%, 
up from only 3% less than a year ago. But rents have only recently recovered after three-
year period in which they were in decline. As a result, yields have been driven down to 
unprecedented depths.1’ 
 
Roehner 2 has made an empirical study of house price peaks looking at bubbles that have 
occurred in the past. Using a simple approach based on work by Sornette3, he has noted 
using  examples  from  different  times  and  different  parts  of  the  globe  that  speculative 
bubbles  exhibit  certain  regularities  in  shape.  Very  recently  in  a  new  publication  he  has 
made a new study of house prices in the Western USA and made a prediction as to the 
way these house prices will evolve over the next few years 4. 
 
In this note we develop the idea and apply it to house prices in the UK over the period 
1952-2006.  As  a  result  we  conclude  that  a  similar  speculative  house  price  bubble  is 

currently under way in the UK. The data allows a similar interpretation to that of Roehner 
for the US and as to the evolution of UK house prices over the next few years is possible. 
In  addition  we  examine  data  for  Irish  house  prices  over  the  period  1997-2006.  By 
comparing this data with that for the UK we can see that Dublin appears to have joined 
the ‘global’ group of cities that exhibit similar house price dynamics and that for the first 
time  in  recent  years,  house  price  dynamics  are  synchronized  with  London.  We  can 
anticipate a similar evolution in the future. 
 
House prices in the UK 
 
House price data for the UK and Northern Ireland can be obtained from both the Halifax 
and Nationwide Building society web sites. Both are similar and figure 1 below has been 
downloaded from the Nationwide Building Society.

The  peak  that  occurred  in  the  UK  during  the  late  1980’s  is  clearly  visible.  The 
geographical  variation  across  the  UK  has  been  studied  by  Roehner.  We  note  here  that 
lower line for Northern Ireland that is essentially Belfast. This is apparently uncorrelated 
with the frenetic activity on the UK mainland and we return to this point later. 
 
However following Roehner it is more revealing to compute the house prices in constant 
money terms. This is shown in figure 2.

It is interesting to compare this graph with that recently published by Roehner for house 
prices in the Western US. This is shown below in Fig 3.

The US data shows strong peaks at ~1969, 1979 and 1989. Clear peaks on the UK data 
are visible at 1974, 1979 and 1989. Looking closely at the US data we see some evidence 
of  a  peak  or  shoulder  at  ~1973.  This  was  ignored  by  Roehner,  who  focussed  on  the 
almost identical character of the major peaks, but now we can see that it corresponds to a 
similar but more pronounced peak that occurred in London at this time. We note here that 
Roehner  used  smoothed  data  points  that  possibly  reduced  the  impact  of  some  of  these 
secondary  peaks.  We  did  not  smooth  the  data  used  to  compute  the  curve  in  Fig  2.  In 
passing,  this  author  recalls  that  Australia  experienced  a  similar  boom  during  the  period 
1973-4 from which he profited as he relocated from Australia back to the UK. Looking 
even more closely at the UK data there is a suggestion of a very weak peak around 1969 
but without the supporting evidence of the strong peak in the US at this time, one would 
probably ignore this. However, all this suggests house price correlations have increased 
not  only  between  the  UK  and  the  US  since  World  War  2  but  also  across  the  English 
speaking world. At this time there is essentially complete correlation between the UK and 
the US. Furthermore from the UK data it seems clear that the house price peak is not only 
at a maximum but is tipping over. This is consistent not only with the work of Roehner 

but also Sornette and Zhow 5 who have also predicted using more similar albeit complex 
arguments based on the existence of log periodic oscillations that the US data will peak in 
2006.  
 
In figure 4 we compare the US Dow Jones with the FTA index since the late 19th century 
and one can see that the US economic engine  began to develop strongly after the Civil 
war.  The  UK  index  however  did  not  really  get  into  gear  until  after  the  Second  World 
War. By the 1980’s it is clear that there is essentially complete correlation between the 
two indices.

If  one  assumes  that  the  mechanism  driving  house  prices  continues  now  in  a  manner 
similar to activity since the 1980’s in the UK, or the 1960’s in the US, then one can assert 
on the basis of the above evidence that the peak has been reached and is now tipping over 
into the downturn. If it follows past trends then we can expect a hard landing with falls of 
6-8% per annum relative to inflation for then next 4-5 years. Whether it will continue and 
the  full  triangular  shape  of  the  current  peak  takes  form  we  cannot  say  with  certainty. 
Perhaps  governments  will  have  some  hitherto  unknown  policies  or  tools  that  they  may 
implement to counteract such a downturn but on again on the basis of past experience it 
seems unlikely, although a strong dose of inflation might help! The author was interested 
to  see  that  at  the  time  of  writing  this  piece,  the  BBC  News  web  site  was  carrying  the 
headline  ‘Markets  beset  by  inflation  fears’6.  That  being  said  perhaps  by  the  time  of  the 
next general election in the UK, the government might be able to say that housing is once 
again available for all at reasonable prices!  
 
House prices in Ireland 
Long time series for house price data comparable to those available for the UK seem not 
to be readily available. Figure 5 shows

data  for  prices  of  houses  both  in  Dublin  and  outside  for  the  period  1995  to  the  first 
quarter of 2006. Both curves are rising strongly over this period in line with both US and 
UK  data.  Can  we  say  any  more?  As  a  first  step  we  have  converted  the  data  from  EUR 
into GBP and superimposed the data onto that for the UK and Northern Ireland (Figure 5)

It is immediately evident that the data over this period has broken away from Northern 
Ireland.  Data  for  Dublin  is  now  essentially  following  that  of  London  and  the  data  for 
houses outside Dublin is following that of a provincial city in England.  
We  can  go  further  and,  convert  the  Irish  data  using  the  Irish  consumer  price  index  to 
constant  1980  prices.  The  superposition  of  this  data  for  Dublin  onto  similar  prices  for 
London is shown in figure 7.

It  seems  that  the  Irish  prices  have  also  peaked.  Perhaps  the  downturn  will  lag  a  little 
behind  that  for  the  UK  according  to  the  projection  we  have  made  for  prices  in  London 
now  shown  in  open  squares.  However  a  downturn  there  will  be  according  to  these 
calculations. 
 
It seems clear that Dublin as a result of the economic expansion during the last 20 years 
has now emerged as a major city on a global scale and is also driving house prices in the 
manner of all other major cities.  
 
Conclusions 
House prices, it would seem, exhibit regular, almost universal behaviour across time and 
geographic  domain.  Roehner  has  suggested  that  major  cities  are  ‘hot  spots’  where  this 
activity  is  galvanised.  From  the  perspective  of  the  physicist,  this  suggests  that 
mechanisms akin to self organised criticality are driving such asset prices. 
 
As a result of substantial investment and economic activity in recent decades, Dublin now 
seems  to  have  joined  this  group  of  ‘hot  spots’.  The  consequence  is  that  prices  will 
become  rather  more  volatile  than  in  the  past  exhibiting  peaks  and  troughs  that  are  the 
signature of other ‘hot spots’. This increase in correlation of house prices between cities 
is very reminiscent of phase locking in complex systems observed recently by Holyst 7 
 
Whilst house prices in all these cities across the world have been rising strongly in recent 
years, the analysis suggests that they have now peaked and an equally strong downturn 
(relative to inflation) is likely.

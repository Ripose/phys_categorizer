ABSTRACT 

 
It  is  a  familiar  fact  that  the  total  measured  light  yield  of  NaI  (Tl)  detectors  is  a 
nonlinear function of temperature. Here we present new experimental data for the 
temperature  behavior  of  doped  NaI(Tl)  scintillators  that  instead  shows  a  linear 
dependence  of  light  output  over  a  wide  temperature  range—  including  that  for 
outdoor  applications.  The  shape  of  the  light  pulse  shows  in  general  two  decay 
processes: a  single dominant process above room temperature and two decay time 
constants  below.  We  show  that    redistribution  of  the  intensities  is  temperature-
dependent; the second (slow) decay component is negligible at room temperatures, 
but,  by  –20°C,  it  contributes  up  to  40%  of  the  total  light  and  has  a  duration  of 
several microseconds. We discuss the profound effect this new understanding of the 
light  output  has  on  the  pulse  height  analysis  instrumentation.  We  introduce  a 
theoretical  model  to  explain  the  experimental  results.  In  addition,  we  describe  a 
unique  technique  for  correcting  both  amplitude  and  shape  temperature  changes 
inside the NaI(Tl) detector package.  
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
   The  NaI(Tl)  scintillator  is  one  of  the  first 
gamma  detectors  used  for  spectroscopy.  Even 
now,  many  decades  after  its  establishment,  it 
continues  to  be  the  first  choice  for  outdoor 
gamma spectroscopy because of  its combination 
of  cost  efficiency  and  reliability.  The  very 
complicated  process  of  converting  the  ionizing 
energy into an electrical signal causes a complex 
temperature dependence of the scintillator’s light 
output. Its properties were  intensively  studied in 
the  1960s  and  described  in  major  textbooks  and 
monographs.1,2

inconsistent.  To 
explain  the  observed  nonlinear  behaviour  of  the 
light  output  for  NaI  (Tl),  an  additional  function  
f(Temperature)    that  represents  probability  of 
occupation  of  the  activation  centres  has  been 
introduced.2 
    The  developers  of 
the  original  detector 
technology  in  fact  observed  a  secondary  light 
component2  with  a  longer  time  constant.  The 
time  dependence  of  NaI(Tl)  fluorescence  was 
measured precisely at room temperature with the 
delayed coincidences method,7 and two dominant 
decay  time  components  were  observed.  Because 
95% of the total light yield is collected within the 
first  800 ns, 
the  second 
component  has  been  neglected,  and  use  of 
shapers  with  about  1 μs  peaking  time  has  been 
recommended. 
this 
recommendation  and 
the  desire  for  higher 
throughput  made  a  short  shaping  time  (1 μs  and 
below) the common choice for NaI(Tl) detectors. 
     In recent years, the awareness of the impact of 
signal  processing  on  the  temperature  drift  has 
increased.8  Those  measurements,8  using  a  very 
long shaping time, in fact showed a nearly linear 
T-dependence  of  the  light  output,  although  this 
attracted  no  comment,  and  the  physical  reasons 
were not discussed.

  The 
component  halide  scintillator—CsI  (Tl)—was 
extensively 
and

of  its  use  with  a  photodiode  light  sensor.10  The 
relative intensities and time constants of both fast 
and  slow  components  were  measured  over  a 
wide  temperature  range,  and  an  explanation  of 
the origin of the two components was given.11 
   One  of  us  observed  the  slow  component  at 
room temperatures long ago and found it to be a 
limiting  factor  for  high  count  rate  applications 
(e.g.,  for  the  spent  fuel  attribute  test)  using 
NaI(Tl)  detectors.12  A  unique  preamplifier

light  yield  of  NaI(Tl) 
scintillators was measured in 1998 as a corollary 
of  work

Aktau, Kazakhstan. The first public disclosure of 
the  results  was  a  patent  application  filed14 
because  of  increased  interest  in  that  problem 
after the events of 9/11.   
   In 
this  paper,  we  present  comprehensive 
experimental data and an outline of a quantitative 
model  explaining  the  temperature  behavior  of 
doped NaI(Tl) scintillators. We outline technical 
solutions  for  overcoming  the  deleterious  effects 
of  that  behavior.    Our  study  shows  linear  T-
dependence  of  the  NaI(Tl)  light  output  over  a 
wide

outdoor  applications.  The  normalized  shape  of 
the light pulse shows a dual character:

   The  second  decay  component  is  negligible  at 
room temperatures, but, at –20°C, it occupies up 
to  40%  of  the  total  light  and  lasts  several 
microseconds. 
  We  believe  that  not  taking  the  correct  time 
profile  of  the  light  pulse  into  account  has  been 
misleading  users  and  developers  over 
the 
decades.    The  artificial  broad  maximum  in  the 
light  yield  comes  from  a  convolution  between 
the  finite  width  of  the  shaper  response  function 
and the temperature-dependent shape of the light 
pulse.  That 
causes  profound 
dependence  on  all  characteristics  of  NaI(Tl) 
spectrometers.  
 
2. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
Considering  the  temperature  dependence  of  the 
duration of NaI(Tl)6  light pulse and shaping with 
a peak  time shorter  than  the  total light pulse  led 
us  to  the  idea  that  the  previously  reported3 
nonlinear 
temperature  dependence  does  not 
describe  the  total  light  output.  Here  we  prove 
that  this  temperature  dependence  is  an  artificial 
result of convolution between the light pulse and 
shaper response  if changed with the  temperature 
duration of PMT current pulse and finite duration 
of shaper response. So  the shaper will not “see” 
an increasing fraction of the light pulse when the 
temperature is reduced below 0°C. This effect is

   A shaper with a flat top equal to or longer than 
the  duration  of  the  light  pulse  will  eliminate 
effects  resulting  from  changes  in  the  temporal 
dependence  of  the  light  emission.  The  Gated 
Integrator 
the  simplest  and  most 
convenient  shaper  that  can  provide  a  signal 
proportional  to  the  integrated  amount  of  light 
emitted.  To  demonstrate  the  effect  of  shaping, 
we have compared the Na(Tl) spectrum obtained 
with  semigaussian  and  Gated  Integrator  shapers 
using a broad range of shaping time constants. In  
a  simple  experiment,  we  placed  the  whole  PMT 
and  scintillator  assembly  in  an  environmental 
chamber  with 
the  electronics  at  ambient 
temperature.  Thus,  the  measured  temperature 
effect is the result of temperature dependences of 
both  the  scintillation  crystal  and  the  PMT. 
Because  the  temperature  coefficient  of  the  PMT 
is  almost  constant  over  a  wide  temperature 
range,21it will add to the temperature dependence 
arising  from  the  crystal  scintillation.  Figure  1 
shows  the  block  diagram  of  the  experimental 
setup.

The  temperature  does  not  affect  the  FWHM  as 
badly  as  the  peak  position.  The  resolution  does 
not  depend  on  the  shaping  time  constant  above 
room  temperature  because  all  shapers  “see”  the 
total  light.  But  below  room  temperature  where 
the  actual  redistribution  between 
light 
components occurs, the difference is observable. 
That  fact  does  not  have  significant  practical 
consequence  except 
the  dual 
temperature behavior of Na(Tl)  light output.   
 
3. THEORETICAL MODEL 
  Our  model 
temperature-dependent 
behavior of the NaI (Tl) scintillators is based on 
two  dominant  components  of  the  light  pulse  we 
measured:  one  fast  with  a  time  constant  of  230 
nsec and one slow with a time constant of about 
1 μsec. These two components correspond to two 
different  processes  in  the  crystal.  The  physical 
picture of the processes briefly is as follows: 
  In  the  very  beginning  of  the  process,  we  have 
production  of  electron-hole  pairs  along  the  path 
of  the  ionizating  particle.  Because  of  the  very 
strong  coupling  between  the  electron  and  holes 
in alkali halide crystals,15 excitons are formed in 
a  mobile  exciton  band  followed  by  rapid 
conversion  into  Self-Trapped  Excitons  (STE) 
because  of  the  interaction  with  the  ions  of  the 
crystal  lattice.16  The  fast  component  of  light 
emission  results  from  the  prompt  capture  of  the 
STE by the (Tl+) level.17 
  Note  that  all  the  light  emitted  (from  both  slow 
and fast processes) comes from the same optical 
transition on the activator level. In our model, the 
redistribution  of  the  light  output  arises  from  a 
competition  between  different  mechanisms  for 
reaching  the  activator  levels.  This  redistribution 
occurs  by 
the 
population  of 
temperature 
dependence exists because the STE can reach the 

temperature  dependence  of 

the  STE.18  The

followed  by  capture  and  recombination.  This 
process competes with the multi-phonon-assisted 
dissociation  of  the  STE19  and  transport  to  the 
activator  level  by  independent  electrons  and 
holes.  In this way, a part of the STE can “feed” 
the population of excitons responsible for the fast 
component  of 
light  output  at  every 
temperature. The rest of the STE, through multi-
into 
phonon-assisted  dissociation,  dissociate 
electrons  and  holes.  After  this  multi-phonon-
assisted  dissociation,  the  separate  carriers  by 
binary diffusion can reach and be captured by the 
(Tlo)  center  and  then  recombine.17  This  second 
mechanism  is  responsible  for  the  amplitude  of 
the  slower  component  of  the  light  output  of  the 
NaI (Tl) scintillators. Figure 5 shows a schematic 
of the model, which gives rise to a set of coupled 
rate  equations.  A  more  detailed  analysis  of  this 
model will appear elsewhere.20

4. SIGNAL PROCESSING OF NaI(Tl) 
LIGHT PULSES 
 
We have shown that the temperature changes the 
light  pulse  shape  and  duration  in  a  very  wide 
range  from  one  microsecond  to  more  than  10 
microseconds  at  negative 
temperatures.  The 
variable  shape  of  the  signal  is  much  more 
difficult  to  handle  than  the  changed  amplitude. 
Therefore,  we  have  developed  a  proprietary 
technology  for  the  correction  of  temperature 
changes  of  both  amplitude  and  shape  of  PMT 
current  pulses.14  It  is  based  on  the  unique 
property that the weighted sum of  a prompt and 
integrated exponential function is a step function. 
The solution for a single exponential component 

is  rather  intuitive:  a  resistor  connected  in  series 
with the integrating capacitor.  The output signal 
is a sum of the voltages across the R-C network:

This allows use of any MCA and implementation 
of  simple  temperature  correction  in  the  detector 
package.14  The 
for 
stabilization  allows  use  of  a  very  low  intensity   
40K  background  source  for  peak  tracking  and 
prompt  compensation  for  any  rough  or  sudden 
temperature drift.  
 
The exact value of the second component can be 
measured  by  using  only  the  first  R-C  network 
R1,  C1,  thus  compensating  the  fast  component 
only.    This  scheme  is  applicable  also  for  pulse-

5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
We  have  observed  the  temperature  dependence 
of  NaI(Tl) 
temperature-
light  output  as  a 
dependent  redistribution  between  fast  and  slow 
components.  The  slow  component  is  negligible 
at  room  temperature,  but  it  accommodates  a 
substantial  fraction  of  the  total  light  output  at 
temperatures  below  0°C.  We  measured  a  linear 
temperature  dependence  of  the  fluorescent  yield 
of  NaI(Tl) 
the  outdoor 
temperature  range  when  the  total  light  pulse  is 
integrated.  The  broad  maximum 
the 
previously  published  data  is  thus  explained  as  a 
convolution  between  the  temperature-dependent 
shape of the light pulse and the shaper response. 
the  above 
Our 
behavior  as  arising 
two  competing 
processes (exciton hopping and binary diffusion) 
to reach the activation centers.  
A proprietary technique that compensates for the 
temperature  dependence  of  the  light  pulse  has 
been  developed.  It  provides  a  step  response  or 
single  exponential  rise  time  of  the  preamplifier 
output,  thus  compensating  for  the  redistribution 
between  the  slow  and  fast  components.  This 
technique  will  improve  the  high  count  rate 
performance  of  NaI(Tl)  scintillation  detectors 
and mitigate the  temperature  effect on the shape 
of light pulse.

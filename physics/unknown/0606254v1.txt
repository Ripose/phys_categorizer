We examine the dynamics of cylinders that are grooved to form N teeth for rolling motion down an
inclined plane. The grooved cylinders are experimentally found to reach a terminal velocity. This
result can be explained by the inclusion of inelastic processes which occur whenever a tooth hits the
surface. The fraction of
is lost during an inelastic collision is
phenomenologically found to be proportional to 2 sin2 (cid:112)/N(cid:50)(cid:97)sin3 (cid:112)/N, and the method of least
squares is used to ﬁnd the constant (cid:97)(cid:53)0.98. The adjusted theoretical results for the time of rolling
as well as for terminal velocity are found to be in good agreement with the experimental results.

I. INTRODUCTION

A few years ago an article appeared in this journal1 which
described how the fractal dimension of a randomly crumpled
surface might be determined by rolling it down an inclined
plane and measuring its moment of inertia I. In this paper,
the claim is made that the moment of inertia of a hypersphere
is given by

I(cid:53)(cid:103)M R 2,

(cid:126)1(cid:33)

where (cid:103)is a constant that depends on the dimension of the
hypersphere, M is its mass, and R is its radius. This conjec-
ture was used to attempt to measure the fractal dimension of
tightly crumpled aluminum foil balls. However, it has been
shown2 that this same sort of variation in the dynamically
measured moment of
inertia occurs with symmetrically
grooved cylinders, such as the one depicted in Fig. 1, which
are not fractals.

These observations prompt one to ask to what extent the
‘‘almost rolling’’ motion of the grooved cylinders can be

analyzed and understood. In particular, can the motion of
regular grooved cylinders be accurately described in any
simple way by dynamics and conservation laws of basic
physics? Furthermore, there does not seem to be any refer-
ence to this kind of ‘‘nearly rolling’’ motion in the physics
literature. Advanced engineering texts3,4 discuss rolling mo-
tion and contact, collisions, enmeshed gears, etc. However,
the ‘‘rolling’’ of a ‘‘gear’’ or ‘‘slotted cylinder’’ does not
seem to have been studied. This ‘‘rolling’’ motion of a
grooved cylinder is similar to the motion of a smooth cylin-
der rolling on a rough surface. A rough surface tends to slow
down a rolling smooth cylinder and is considered part of
rolling friction,4 although the dynamics of this effect has not
been well analyzed.

In this paper, we report a study of the ‘‘nearly rolling’’
motion of regularly grooved cylinders down an incline of
ﬁxed angle. In Sec. II, the motion of such objects is analyzed
using Lagrangian dynamics and making the simplifying as-
sumption that no energy is dissipated by the ‘‘collisions’’
between the teeth and the inclined plane, but that the total
energy of the cylinder is completely conserved. A recursive
scheme is then derived for predicting how long a cylinder
will take to roll a given, but variable, distance along an in-
cline. Computer calculations yield predictions for these roll-
ing times. In Sec. III, experiments are described which were
used to measure the rolling times and to compare with the
theoretical predictions. The results of the ﬁrst of these mea-
surements are in marked disagreement with the theoretical
predictions, with the assumption that the ‘‘collisions’’ are
completely elastic. Indeed, the experimental data show that
the cylinders reach terminal velocity, in contrast to the the-
oretical predictions.

A more precise theoretical model of this ‘‘near rolling’’
motion is then presented in Sec. IV, which allows for inelas-
tic processes to occur as the cylinder ‘‘rolls.’’ Predictions of
this modiﬁed theory for the measured rolling times and ter-
minal velocities are remarkably accurate.

A. Rotational kinetic energy

We will make the assumption that the grooved cylinder is
rolling without slipping, i.e., the single pivot point, P in Fig.
2, does not slide. So as shown in Fig. 2, the cylinder will
simply pivot about each tooth at the point P until the next
tooth comes in contact with the inclined plane. In Fig. 2, (cid:99)is
the elevation angle of the incline and (cid:117)is the angle through
which the center of mass has rotated starting from a vertical
position. The kinetic energy T of the rolling grooved cylin-
der is entirely rotational (cid:126)about P(cid:33) and is given by

T(cid:53) 1

2I P

(cid:117)˙ 2,

where I P is the moment of inertia of the grooved cylinder
about the edge of the tooth in contact with the inclined plane
(cid:126)point P(cid:33), and (cid:117)˙ is the angular velocity about P.

B. Time of rolling of the grooved cylinder

Using the parallel axis theorem, Eq. (cid:126)2(cid:33) becomes

T(cid:53) 1

2

(cid:126) M R 2(cid:49)I cm

(cid:33)(cid:117)˙ 2,

where M is the mass of the grooved cylinder, R is the outer
radius (cid:126)i.e., the distance from the center of mass to the edge
of a tooth(cid:33), and I cm is its moment of inertia about an axis
through the center of mass. If we take the potential energy to
be zero when (cid:117)is zero, then the potential energy U can be
expressed as

U(cid:53)M gh(cid:53)M gR(cid:126)cos (cid:117)(cid:50)1 (cid:33),

using the fact that the change in height h of the center of
mass as a function of (cid:117)is h(cid:53)R(cos (cid:117)(cid:50)1). So the Lagrangian
L is

L(cid:53) 1

II. DYNAMICS

Our problem consists of calculating the time it takes for a
grooved cylinder to rotate about one tooth as it is rolling
down an inclined plane. This section contains a discussion of
the dynamics for this motion and a derivation of an expres-
sion for the time of rolling.

tion and can be solved to ﬁnd the time t it takes for the
grooved cylinder to rotate about a given tooth, starting at the
instant the previous tooth leaves the surface of the inclined
plane and ending with the instant the next tooth strikes the
surface. The result is

Eq. (cid:126)11(cid:33) the value of the initial angular velocity (cid:118)

(cid:53)0.

The total time (cid:116)it takes for the grooved cylinder to roll a
given distance is just the sum over the time integrals from
Eq. (cid:126)10(cid:33) for each rotation about a tooth. We write

angle. This is an elliptic integral and must be evaluated nu-
merically. We ﬁnd by geometry that the initial and ﬁnal
angles are (cid:99)(cid:49)(cid:112)/N and (cid:99)(cid:50)(cid:112)/N, respectively, where (cid:99) is
the elevation angle of the inclined plane (cid:126)see Fig. 3(cid:33). So we
have

integral for the kth rotation. It can be seen by geometry that

where L is the distance traveled along the inclined plane. We
need n to be an integer so the greatest integer function is

So we are left with the computation of

where we have used the initial condition that (cid:117)˙ is the initial
0 when (cid:117)(cid:53)(cid:99)(cid:50)(cid:112)/N. Similarly, we know
angular velocity (cid:118)
that (cid:117)˙ is the ﬁnal angular velocity (cid:118)
f when (cid:117)(cid:53)(cid:99)(cid:49)(cid:112)/N, so
that Eq. (cid:126)8(cid:33) becomes

Since for the moment we assume no loss of kinetic energy
from the teeth striking the incline, the ﬁnal angular velocity
for the rotation about one tooth is the initial angular velocity
for the rotation about the next tooth. Substitute Eq. (cid:126)12(cid:33) into
Eq. (cid:126)11(cid:33) and rearrange to get the recursion relation

C. Moment of inertia

The moment of inertia about the center of mass I cm is
calculated by breaking up the grooved cylinder into triangles
as shown in Fig. 4 and performing the integration over each
triangle and summing, so that

volume, so we ﬁnd that

That this result for I cm yields the correct value of 1
a smooth cylinder can be veriﬁed by taking N!(cid:96) and then
setting r(cid:53)R. Notice that when we substitute Eq. (cid:126)20(cid:33) into
Eq. (cid:126)16(cid:33) the mass cancels out (cid:64)substitute Eq. (cid:126)20(cid:33) into (cid:106)(cid:35). So
the time of rolling is independent of the mass of the grooved
cylinder just as it is for a perfect cylinder.

D. Computer model

A computer program was written to numerically evaluate
the integrals in Eq. (cid:126)16(cid:33). The ﬁrst term in the sum in Eq. (cid:126)16(cid:33)
contains C 1 , which can be calculated from Eq. (cid:126)11(cid:33) for an
initial angular velocity. If the grooved cylinder is started
from rest with two teeth in contact with the surface, then
there is some critical angle of elevation (cid:99)
c below which the
cylinder will not roll. This critical angle depends on the num-
ber of teeth and is given by

(cid:53)

.

(cid:126)21(cid:33)

To ensure that all the grooved cylinders will be able to roll,
we let the initial angular velocity be the angular velocity that
the cylinder would have if it started from rest at a balance
point (cid:117)(cid:53)0. This corresponds to balancing a grooved cylinder
and starting the timer when the ﬁrst tooth strikes the surface
of the inclined plane. We use conservation of energy

(cid:68)T(cid:53)(cid:50)(cid:68)U

(cid:126)22(cid:33)
to ﬁnd the angular velocity, where (cid:68)T is the change in ki-
netic energy and (cid:68)U is the change in potential energy. We
have

velocity as the initial angular velocity for the rotation about
the ﬁrst tooth. Now Eq. (cid:126)11(cid:33) is used to ﬁnd the ﬁrst integra-
tion constant C 1 . All of the other integration constants can
be found by using the recursion relation given by Eq. (cid:126)13(cid:33).
We now have everything that we need in order to compute
the time of rolling for a given grooved cylinder rolling a
prescribed distance down an inclined plane.

The computer model can be easily veriﬁed with a smooth
cylinder simulation, i.e., take a large value for N and take
r(cid:39)R. (cid:126)We cannot have r(cid:53)R because this would lead to
division by zero in the calculation of the moment of inertia(cid:33).
If we let a smooth cylinder roll a distance of 2(cid:112) cm at an
elevation angle of 30 deg, we ﬁnd the analytical value for the
time of rolling to be 0.196 134 s. For the computer calcula-
tion we use the values R(cid:53)1 cm, r(cid:53)0.999 999 99 cm, N
(cid:53)100 000 teeth, and L(cid:53)2(cid:112)R(cid:53)6.283 185 cm. The numeri-
cally computed value for the time of rolling is 0.196 123 s,
which is accurate to ﬁve digits.

III. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

Several grooved cylinders with various numbers of teeth
were needed in order to ﬁnd out how the number of teeth
affects the rolling motion. We used ﬁve solid aluminum cyl-
inders which had been cut to have 12, 18, 30, 45, and 60
teeth. Table I records the mass, inside and outside radii, and
moment of inertia for these grooved cylinders. The moment
of inertia was calculated using Eq. (cid:126)20(cid:33). The grooved cylin-
ders were 2.000 cm long and had an outside radius R of
1.000 cm. The rolling surface used was a sheet of Plexiglas,
which was rigidly attached to a thick ﬂat board. The eleva-
tion angle for this experiment was set at (cid:99)(cid:53)1.39(cid:54)0.02°. An
elevation angle that is too small (cid:126)i.e., less than 1°(cid:33) prevents
the 12-tooth cylinder from proceeding down the inclined
plane when released from rest. On the other hand, if an angle
greater than about 3° is used, the support points for the cyl-
inders can actually leave the surface due to bouncing.

In order to measure the time of rolling a model ME-9215A
Pasco Scientiﬁc Photogate Timer with Memory was attached
to the board with one photogate positioned at the point where
the cylinders would start to roll and another photogate whose
position could be adjusted in 10-cm increments to a given
distance from the ﬁrst photogate. The exact distance between
the photogate beams can be obtained by sliding a strip of
cardboard along the incline until it ‘‘trips’’ the ﬁrst photo-
gate and marking this position. Sliding the cardboard further
until it ‘‘trips’’ the second photogate and marking this posi-
tion allows one to measure the distance between the marks,
which is the distance between the photogate beams.

It was observed that the rolling grooved cylinders would
eventually reach terminal velocity. A microphone was
plugged into a model 54600A 100-MHz,

to pick up the clicking sound of the teeth of the rolling
grooved cylinders as they hit the Plexiglas surface. Each
click of a tooth created a spike on the oscilloscope. At ter-
minal velocity the clicking sound had a constant frequency,
which yielded a constant spacing between spikes on the os-
cilloscope. The grooved cylinders were rolled a given dis-
tance at which point the screen on the oscilloscope was fro-
zen. Two vertical cursors were positioned on the peaks of
two distinct spikes. The oscilloscope indicated the period
between the two cursors. The period was divided by the dis-
tance between the teeth to get the velocity. This method for
measuring the velocity of the rolling cylinders worked quite
well for the 12-, 18-, and 30-toothed cylinders. However,
when this technique was employed for the 45- and 60-
toothed cylinders, it was difﬁcult to separate the impact sig-
nal from the noise and echoes. In order to measure the ter-
minal velocity for these cylinders two photogates were
placed about 10-cm apart at the place the velocity was to be
measured. The photogates would measure the time it took for
the cylinders to roll from one gate to the other. The distance
between the photogates divided by the time was the velocity.
That the cylinders reached terminal velocity was veriﬁed by
measuring the velocities at different rolling distances.

In the ﬁrst part of the experiment the time was measured
for the grooved cylinders to roll 80.02 cm. Each cylinder was
given ﬁve trials. The difﬁculty in this experiment was in
rolling the cylinders through the narrow photogates (cid:126)6.6 cm
wide(cid:33). These times are compared in Table II with the times
predicted from the computer program based on the Lagrang-
ian mechanics. As one can plainly see, there is little agree-
ment between the theoretical and experimental values. The
time values are closest for the 60-toothed cylinder. As the
number of teeth is decreased, the theoretical values slowly
decrease but the experimental values increase signiﬁcantly.
In fact, the cylinders were observed to reach a terminal ve-
locity which was lower—not higher—for fewer teeth.

The standard deviation is given as the estimated error for
the measured times. Errors in the theoretical times are due to
the uncertainty in the elevation angle and the ﬁnal rotation
about the last tooth and will be discussed later.

IV. A MORE COMPLETE THEORETICAL MODEL

In constructing the theoretical model of Sec. II, two as-
sumptions were used: that the cylinders are rotating about
their point of support without slipping and that the loss of
kinetic energy caused by the teeth striking the surface of the
inclined plane is negligible. The ﬁrst assumption is justiﬁed
by the small angle of elevation; therefore, the loss of kinetic
energy caused by the inelastic collisions apparently cannot
be neglected.

Fig. 5. Position and velocity vectors before and after the collision of a tooth
with the inclined plane.

A. Angular momentum model

In retrospect, that the collisions are inelastic should not be
surprising since each tooth strikes the surface and then does
not rebound but stays at that point to act as a pivot. The
duration of the collision extends from the moment a tooth
strikes the surface to the moment the previous tooth lifts off
the surface. Conservation of angular momentum can be used
to ﬁnd out how much energy is lost in these collisions; for
now we will assume an instantaneous collision. Choose a
point on the incline where the front tooth is about to hit (cid:126)just
before the collision(cid:33) as the origin. In general, the angular
momentum L of the cylinder about that point is

where m is the mass of the cylinder, r is the position of the
center of mass relative to that origin, and (cid:118) is the angular
velocity about the center of mass. We note with the aid of
Fig. 5 that the initial velocity vector, which has the magni-
i , makes angle (cid:112)/2(cid:50)2(cid:112)/N with ri . Thus the

ﬁnd a phenomenological term that adds the correct amount to
the angular momentum.

If an additive term can be found which ﬁts the measure-
ments for 80-cm rolling times, then using this additive term
we can compare the theoretical and measured results for the
time of rolling at different lengths and terminal velocity. The
80-cm rolling times were chosen for the ﬁt because of the
relatively low errors in the measured times. A good ﬁt was
obtained using a term that is proportional to sin3 ((cid:112)/N). The
proportionality constant (cid:97)was found by using the method of
least squares to be (cid:97)(cid:53)0.98(cid:54)0.05. Equation (cid:126)27(cid:33) becomes

Table IV compares the theoretical and measured rolling
times for 80 cm using this additional angular momentum
term.

An accurate description of

the ‘‘rolling’’ motion of
grooved cylinders, in addition to predicting rolling times,
should be able to predict the terminal velocities of the cylin-
ders. Experiment showed that each of our grooved cylinders
had reached terminal velocity after rolling 60 cm. The ve-
locities of the cylinders were measured after rolling 115 cm
and, taking an average over ten trials, were compared to the
predictions from our modiﬁed theory. Table V lists these
values.

Rolling times were measured for several different lengths.
The results are given in Table VI. Table VII contains the
predicted rolling times for the lengths used in Table VI.
These predictions come from the modiﬁed theory which in-
cludes inelastic processes. The proportionality constant (cid:97)
(cid:53)0.98 comes from the least-squares best ﬁt to the 80-cm
rolling times. The agreement between the measured and pre-

Using this recursion relation in the computer program to ﬁnd
the integration constant yields the results given in Table III.

B. Model with ﬁnite-time collisions

These results are somewhat better than the previous calcu-
lations. However, since we really do not have instantaneous
collisions some angular momentum must be added back to
the cylinder after each collision due to a net external torque
which acts over a small but ﬁnite period of time. During this
time the surface of the inclined plane is slightly deformed at
the point of contact for both teeth, as depicted in Fig. 6. The
teeth themselves can also be deformed. Figure 6 shows the
relevant forces that cause the net torque about the center of
mass. The forces labeled N1 and N2 are normal forces, and
those labeled f1 and f2 are due to friction. Without knowing

dicted results is remarkable considering we used only a
single best-ﬁt parameter. The only measured value which did
not fall within the error estimates of the predicted value is
the 40-cm rolling time for the 12-toothed cylinder; the most
difﬁcult case from which to obtain reliable results.

V. CONCLUSION

We found that the ‘‘rolling’’ motion of a symmetrically
grooved cylinder can be accurately described by assuming
that the cylinder rotates about each tooth without slipping.
Angular momentum is nearly conserved during the collision,
however, inelastic processes cause a net torque to act on the
cylinder over a small but ﬁnite period of collision time. (cid:126)Re-
call that the collision period extends from the moment the
tooth comes in contact with the inclined plane to the moment
the previous tooth lifts off the plane.(cid:33)

The time it takes a grooved cylinder to ‘‘roll’’ a distance L
along an incline with an elevation angle (cid:99)is given by Eqs.
(cid:126)15(cid:33) and (cid:126)16(cid:33). The integration constant in Eq. (cid:126)16(cid:33) is given
by Eq. (cid:126)31(cid:33), where the proportionality constant (cid:97)was found
to be 0.98(cid:54)0.05 using a least-squares best ﬁt to the 80-cm
rolling times.

This constant probably depends on the coefﬁcient of res-
titution of the cylinders on the incline. The constant (cid:97)may
also depend on the elevation angle, mass and radii of the
grooved cylinders, and elasticity (cid:126)leading to bending mo-
ments(cid:33) of the cylinders and the inclined plane.

The estimated errors given for the measured rolling times
and terminal velocities are the standard deviations of the
measurements. The estimated theoretical errors come from
two sources. The ﬁrst error source is the uncertainty in the
elevation angle. The angle was measured to an accuracy
within 0.02 deg. The amount of error from this source was
estimated by using this variation in the computer program
(cid:126)1.37° instead of 1.39°(cid:33) and ﬁnding the difference from the
originally computed value. Another signiﬁcant error source

comes from not having a complete ﬁnal rotation about the
last tooth. The cylinder ‘‘trips’’ the ﬁnal timing gate before
the ﬁnal rotation is complete. The predicted times include
half of the time it takes to make the ﬁnal rotation which is
also the estimated error from this source.

Additional error comes from the cylinder’s tendency to
travel in a slightly curved path. This tendency would clearly
result in measured times which are longer than for the as-
sumed straight line path. One ﬁnal source of error comes
from the uncertainty in the initial angle and the initial angu-
lar velocity of the grooved cylinders. The cylinders were
released from a vertical balanced position and ‘‘tripped’’ the
initial timing gate just after release. It was assumed that the
timer started after the cylinder had rotated 0.5 deg. The
amount of error from the latter two sources is not likely to be
large and would be difﬁcult to estimate.

Future study on ‘‘rolling’’ motion of grooved cylinders
could focus on determining how the proportionality constant
(cid:97) depends on the various parameters mentioned above.
Grooved cylinders that are not symmetrical would also be
interesting to study. Finally, spheres that are ‘‘grooved’’ in
three dimensions such as tightly crumpled aluminum foil
balls could be investigated. This could contribute to a better
understanding of rolling friction caused by surface rough-
ness.

5No data are available for 60-cm rolling times for the cylinders with 12 and
18 teeth because of the problem of rolling these cylinders through the
narrow timing gates. The 80-cm rolling times were obtained with great
difﬁculty.

WHAT, WHY, HOW

Let me conclude by calling attention to a curious aspect of what I am recommending, an aspect
visible in my urging attention to the concrete special case in order to understand the sweeping
broad generalization. In effect I am saying that we do not, we cannot understand a vacuum—what
we understand is always, in a sense, a fact—and, therefore, just as what cannot be taught without
how, and how cannot be taught without why, the question has come full circle around to its start,
and it turns out that why cannot be taught without what.

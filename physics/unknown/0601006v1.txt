Abstract:  Many  researches  show  that  the  complicated  motion  of  fluid,  such  as  turbulence,  cannot  be  well  solved  by  the 
Navier-Stokes equation. Some researches even go to doubt its effectiveness for turbulence. Chen Zida has founded that the 
definition of vortex, based on the Stokes’s decomposition, cannot well describe the local rotation when the velocity gradient 
is  highly  asymmetric.  Chen  reformulates  the  Stokes’s  S+R  decomposition  into  a  general  S+R  decomposition.  By  further 
extending  Chen’s  results,  this  research  studies  the  motion  equation  of  fluid  for  the  case  where  highly  asymmetric  velocity 
gradient is exhibited. The result shows that the classical NS equation does not meet the requirement of angular momentum 
conservation,  which  is  apparently  ignored  for  infinitesimal  velocity  gradient  of  fluid.  This  paper  reformulates  the  intrinsic 
geometric description of fluid motion and two additional equations are introduced. Combining with the classical NS equation, 
the reformulated motion equations are in closed-form. The research shows that the NS equation is good approximation for 
average flow, so it can not solve the turbulent problem in essential sense. However, this conclusion does not deny that with 
suitable  additional  condition  for  special  engineering  problem  it  is  still  a  would-be  acceptable  approximation.  The  research 
concludes that: (a) large velocity gradient flow (no matter it is steady or un-steady) will produce significant non-symmetric 
stress; (b) un-steady flow (no matter it is infinitesimal or not) will produce non-symmetric stress. The non-symmetric stress 
produces local rotation. When the local rotation is big enough, the flow will become turbulent flow. The research shows that 
there are three ways to determine the turbulent transition condition: (1) solving fluid motion equation; (2) using the intrinsic 
parameters of fluid material; (3) using pressure condition with given material parameters. Therefore, the essential feature of 
turbulent flow is well described in this research. Related equations are given with brief description.

1. Introduction 

The  Navier-Stokes  equations  are  widely  used  in  fluid  mechanics  as  basic  equations.  Its  effectiveness  for 
simple  fluid  motion  is  evident.  In  fact,  NS  equation  has  been  unqualifiedly  used  as  the  unique  foundation  of 
whole fluid dynamics. But, recently, enquiry about its reasonability and solvability has been proposed by many 
researchers [1-2]. Some even goes to claim that the turbulence cannot be solved by the NS equation [3].   

This problem in essential sense has been attacked by Lodge A S (1974). He claimed that except to use body 
tensor  (defined  on  material  under  consideration)  to  establish  motion  equations  the  fluid  motion  cannot  be 
correctly  described[4].  His  concept  of  material  point  is  well  accepted  rather  his  idea  of  body  tensor,  which  is 
difficult to understand.   

Chen Zhida’s research  shows  that,  introducing  commoving  dragging coordinator  system,  the  deformation 
gradient,  in  fact,  is  base  vectors  transformation  among  initial  configuration  and  current  configuration  of 
continuum. In fluids, the deformation gradient on commoving dragging coordinator system can be defined by the 
inertial velocity gradient. By this way, Lodge’s body tensor concept can be achieved. 

The most important advancement for the concept is that Chen’s research shows that the transformation can 
be decomposed into the addition of one symmetric tensor expressing stretching and one unit orthogonal tensor 
expressing local rotation  [5]. This feature makes that the fluid motion can be decomposed into a non-rotational 
flow and a rotational flow. Mathematically, in classical fluid mechanics, the velocity gradient can be divided into 
symmetry part and asymmetry part, where Stokes gave rotation interpretation for infinitesimal asymmetry part. 
Hence,  it  is  clear  the  rotational  flow  is related with  the asymmetry  part  of  velocity  gradient. In  fact,  based  on 
Chen’s  research,  the  asymmetry  part  is  related with  an orthogonal  rotation.  More  important point  is that  Chen 
shows  that  the  symmetry  part  of  transformation  contains  the  contribution  of  orthogonal  rotation.  Therefore, 
geometrically, rotation and stretching have intrinsic relationship rather than be independent. Chen shows that the 
definition of vortex, based on the Stokes’ S+R decomposition [5], cannot well describe the local rotation which is 
essentially different from the global rotation of fluid, when the average local rotation is the main role. However, 
for small average local rotation, the definition of vortex is a good approximation for local rotation. Hence, one 
can only say that the vortex is ill-defined. The ill-definition of vortex is the main cause which misleads many 
researchers on rotational flows. As the consequence of above mentioned problems, the NS equation is ill-used in 
fluid mechanics. 

Chen’s S-R decomposition can be extended to large deformation and large rotation cases with the means of 
discarding  the  unit-orthogonal  rotation  and  replacing  it  with  an  orthogonal  rotation  with  expanding[6].  So, 
geometrically, Chen’s research forms the basis for a complete fluid motion geometry. 

Once  the  orthogonal  rotation  tensor  is  introduced,  the  stress  tensor  will  be  non-symmetric.  In  classical 
mechanics,  the  non-symmetric  stress  is  directly  contradictive  with  the  NS  equation,  as  the  uniqueness  of  NS 
equation is destroyed. This problem has discouraged many potential researchers. 

Fortunately, Chen’s rational mechanics theory forms basis for further research on this sharp problem. This 
research  shows  that,  the  traditional  equilibrium  equation  (NS  equation)  only  meets  moment  conservation,  and 

 

  1

 

 

 

 

 

does not meet the local angular-momentum conservation. The angular-moment conservation shown in the paper 
does  accept  the  non-symmetry  stress  related  with  rotation.  It  is  confirmed  that  for  infinitesimal  non-rotational 
flow the NS equation indeed is accurate. However, for any large flow, the stress must be non-symmetric. Now, it 
is clear that infinitesimal flow and large flow have intrinsic difference. 

Based on Chen’s theory, the symmetry part of motion transformation (be defined as strain rate in Chen’s 
Theory) contains a coupling tensor directly related with rotation tensor, this coupling tensor makes that the strain 
rate defined traditionally significantly differ from the actual value calculated based on measured stress field. The 
additional strain rate related with the coupling tensor is the function of square of elements of asymmetry part of 
velocity gradient. Traditionally, this item is introduced by an additional stress, such as Reynolds stress. Based on 
this research, the classical NS equation is correct but not complete for complicated flow and for turbulence. After 
combining with two new equations related with local angular momentum conservation, the dynamic equations of 
fluid motion are completely established.   

This paper will firstly introduce the related geometrical tensors and then formulate the motion equations for 
fluid motion. After that, two typical rotation motion equations are discussed. One is for incompressible rotation 
flow which not only has no volume variation but also has no linear momentum variation. When the local rotation 
angular  meets  some  conditions,  the  rotational  flow  will  transit  into  turbulent  flow.  The  research  gives  the 
geometrical  condition  and  the  turbulent  pressure  condition  for  turbulent  transition.  Another  kind  of  rotation  is 
compressible rotational flow which always has velocity increasing. For isothermal flow, the velocity increasing 
gives  the  bubble  volume  density.  The  geometrical  condition  and  the  turbulent  pressure  condition  for  turbulent 
transition  and  instability  are  given  by  related  equations.  Finally,  the  intrinsic  geometric  structure  of  turbulent 
flow and the critical condition for turbulent transition are summarized. 
 
2. Intrinsic Geometric Description of Fluid Motion

For a selected Lagrange coordinator system 
,

on the continuum, it is a Riemann three-dimension 
,
space. Chen Zhida defines the commoving dragging coordinator system as such a Lagrange coordinator system 
that  its  base  vectors  transforms  according  to  the  deformation  of  continuum  while  the  Lagrange  coordinator 
ix , 
parameterization maintain the same for initial configuration and current configuration. For a material point 
there is a finite unit volume fluid element covering it. If the number of particles within the unit volume covering 
is  enough  to  present  a  significant  macroscopic  representation,  it  is  reasonable  to  introduce  macroscopic 
representation of the inertial velocity 

iu   and density  ρ  defined at the material point

dragging  coordinator  system,  its  base  vectors  is  transformed  by  the  transformation 

jF   from  initial 
configuration  to  current  configuration  (for  detailed  discussion,  please  refer  Appendix  A).  Note  that  the  whole 
motion  of  fluid  (no  matter  it  is  rotational  or  non-rotational)  has  zero  velocity  gradient  on  the  commoving 
dragging coordinator system, hence, the velocity gradient represents the local relative motion, which is named as 
deformation in solid continuum.

Chen  Zhida  has  shown  that  the  velocity  transformation  can  be  decomposed  into  the  addition  of  one 
symmetry tensor expressing stretching and one unit orthogonal tensor expressing local rotation [2-5]. That is, we 
have:

Hence, Chen Zhida’s S-R decomposition can be extended to large deformation and large rotation cases with 
the means of discarding the unit-orthogonal rotation and replacing it with an orthogonal rotation with expanding 
or contracting. The paper shows that for large shear flow the correct definition of local average rotation angular 

should be defined by equation (9). For large shear, the average angular tends to 

. If the local average rotation 

π

angular  is  more  than 

,  then  the  continuity  condition  for  continuum  will  be  destroyed.  So,  we  define  the 

average angular range is 

(

.   

In the following research, the decomposition (2) will be referred as Chen’s form-one and the decomposition 
(10) will  be referred  as  Chen’s  form-two. The  complex of  fluid  motion  is  that  it has  two  intrinsic  geometrical 
forms of motion modes. Later, it will become clear that the Chen’s form-one corresponds to elastic flow and the 
Chen’s form-two corresponds to irreversible flow.

completely  determined  by  local  average  rotation  feature,  shows  that  for  shearing  fluid  motion  the  traditional

To  make  the  meaning  more  clear,  we  take  the  conventional  rectangular  coordinator  system  as  the 

co-moving coordinator system defined on original configuration. In this case, we have [5]:

. Hence, we can conclude that the stress determined by traditional strain rate 
components: 
is  bigger  than  the  intrinsic  stress  defined  by  Chen’s  form-two  strain  rate  on  the  local  average  rotation  axis 
direction and that the stress determined by traditional strain rate is less than the intrinsic stress defined by Chen’s 
form-one strain rate on the local average rotation axis direction. It means that, no matter what stress level is, the 
non-symmetric parts of transformation (related with traditional vorticity) makes the two forms of decomposition 
be same possible. What will be the actual one? This problem only can be answered by the dynamics of fluid flow. 
Therefore, it must be historical. On the other hand, the coexistence may be possible for some fluid motion case. 
If this is true, only non-steady flow can meets it. Now, it is clear, the fluid motion is un-steady in essential sense. 
Hence,  it  is  very  important  to  define  the  local  rotation  related  stress,  or  the  stress  related  with  vorticity  in 
traditional sense. To this purpose, the rotation strain rate should be defined. 

In  the  conventional  rectangular  coordinator  system,  according  to  the  well  known  Navier-Stokes’s  wave 

equation, the stress definition for isotropic Newton fluid is:

It means that for a given stress field, two flow modes may be produced. So, turbulent flow must be very 
common for Newton fluid. In non-linear fluid mechanics, it is studied by bifurcation theory. This research shows 
that the fluid motion has two intrinsic forms of geometric structure. 
 
4. Motion Equations for Complicated Motion of Fluid 
 
For fluids, it is meaningless to define the position of a particle as the particles are not only interchangeable 
but also have variant configurations. The continuum of fluid can not be simplified as the usual elastic continuum 
although  the  Lagrange  coordinator  system  does  mean  that  special  material  representation  is  under  discussion. 
Mathematically,  the  material  representation  and  be  constructed  by  unit  covering  concept.  If  the  number  of 
particles  within  the  unit  volume  covering  is  enough  to  present  a  significant  macroscopic  representation,  it  is 
iu   and  density  ρ  defined  at  the 
reasonable  to  introduce  macroscopic  representation  of  the  inertial  velocity 
space point as:

as  continuous  and  differentiable.  For  each  unit  volume  covering  in  Lagrange  coordinator  system,  the  physical 
volume and its actual configuration are variant but its Lagrange coordinators are invariant.

It is the conventional NS equation. For this case, the stress must be symmetric. Hence, it can be inferred that for 
general fluid motion NS equation is not complete and hence cannot be closed. 
Therefore,  for  fluid  motion  the  conventional  NS  equation  must  be  complemented  by  two  additional 
 
equations.  As  these  two  equations  are  derived  from  the  angular  momentum  conservation,  a  reasonable 
conclusion is that the conventional NS equation only meets linear momentum conservation and does not meet 
the angular momentum conservation.

Therefore, the Reynolds fluid motion equation is correct in form. However, in traditional treatment of statistic 
interpretation  the  Reynolds  stress becomes  an  artificial  item,  which  can be  introduced by  many  possible  ways 
and by different, even controversial, interpretation. This just is what happened in fluid mechanics.   
 
Summering  above  discussion,  both  of  the  conventional  NS  fluid  motion  equation  and  the  Reynolds  fluid 
motion equation are included in the fluid motion equation (30). Therefore, the equation (30) will be used later for 
detailed  study.  For  simplicity,  the  standard  rectangular  coordinator  system  will  be  taken  as  the  commoving 
dragging coordinator system.

It shows that for a pure local rotation incompressible flow, the traditional strain rate 

ijs   is determined by 
the local rotation axis direction and local average rotation angle  Θ . For pure rotation flow, the traditional strain 
rate is symmetric. This makes it cannot explain the local rotation motion. On the other hand, the local rotation in 
continuum is different from the rigid rotation in that it always require non-zero classical strain rate. From this 
point to see, the most suitable definition of pure rotation should be equation (42) or 

0=i

.

That is to say that a pure plane local rotation will cause rotation plane symmetric velocity gradient. In this case, 
if  one  uses  traditional  strain  rate  definition  to  calculate  stress,  he  will  report  that  there  is  an  additional  plane 
pressure. As we know that such an additional plane pressure does not exist for pure local rotation flow, one may 
find that symmetric strain rate should be defined by 

i

jS   rather than

It shows that the velocity field is a pure rotation field. Most important feature of incompressible flow is that its 
kinetic energy is invariant. Therefore, it should be very comment phenomenon for incompressible fluid flow. 
 

So,  the  pure  rotation  of  fluid  should  be  defined  by 

jR   for  its  rotation  axis  direction  instead  of  the 

i

definition of vortex and by  Θ   for its magnitude instead of vortices. 
 

For  the  pure  rotation  flow,  the 

independent motion parameter, that is 

i
jL , and  Θ , they form a complete motion equations. The equation 
(41-3) will degenerate in to an equation about pressure. So, the pressure is not intrinsic parameter of fluid, and it 
is motion-dependent. This equation is the fist one which gives analytical expression of fluid pressure. 

i
jL   has  only  two  independent  parameters.  So,  equations  (41)  have  six

calculation  equation  for  the  pressure  p~ .  If  one  supposes  the  pressure  p~   is  constant,  the  fluid  feature 
parameters  λ  and  µ  are not intrinsic. They will be pressure-dependent or rotation-dependent. For rotational 
fluid flow, many controversial come from the definition of pressure. In most theoretic treatment, the pressure is

Note that for infinitesimal rotation, the “static” pressure is: 

. If  µ  is negative, the pressure is the 
normal positive pressure. However, if  µ  is positive, the pressure will be negative pressure. The turning point is 
determined by zero pressure state, that is: 
 

 
Therefore,  for  a  given  fluid  the  incompressible  pure  rotation  flow  has  a  critical  rotation  angular  at  this  local 
rotation angular the fluid pressure is zero. Mathematically, this point defines the instability of fluid motion.

For large velocity gradient flow, even the flow is steady absolutely that any time differential items are zero,

The stress is still non-symmetric.

or non-steady) will produce non-symmetric stress; (b) un-steady flow (no matter it is infinitesimal or not) will 
produce non-symmetric stress. 
 
fluid flow must be rotational. If the local rotation is irreversible, accumulation effects will appear.   
 
For the rotation mode defined by Chen’s form-one, when the local rotation angular is big enough, it will 
change  into  the  rotation  mode  defined  by  Chen’s  form-two.  As  the  velocity  will  be  keep  increasing  for 
compressible pure rotation flow, it can infer that the flow will become unstable.   
 
In fact, at the critical point of instability, the local rotation will from conventional plane rotation change into 
axis expanding rotation. Then bubble will be produced. The flow will become complicated and un-steady. That is 
it becomes into turbulent flow.

At the critical state, the deformation mode is not unique. From physical consideration, the stress field must 

 
be unique. As the stress is defined by equation (29), the critical condition by stress continuity is:

If both of stress continuity and strain rate continuity are required, only limited and discrete  θ  and  Θ   can 

the equations (72) and (62) form a complete description of turbulent transition.   
 
meet them. Therefore, turbulent flow is discrete in essential sense. 
 

Once the flow becomes turbulent flow, bubble will be produced which is characterized by bubble volume

  (65).  Now,  it  is  clear  that  the  bubble  will  appear  suddenly  when  the  flow 

θ
changed into turbulent flow.   
 
Carefully examining equations (62), (65), and (72), it can conclude that the geometric structure of turbulent 
flow is completely determined by the initial conventional rotation flow which meets motion equation (31) with 
Chen’s form-one decomposition.   
 
initial  conditions  the  parameters 

Therefore, if using Chen’s form decomposition in the fluid motion equation (31) with suitable boundary or 
i
jL   and  Θ   can  be  determined,  then  it  is  not  turbulent  flow.  If  the  solution 

does not exist, then the flow must be turbulent flow. Then, by the upper limits of parameters 

i
jL   and  Θ   for a 
practical problem, the turbulent transition condition can be estimated. Further, by the upper limits, the feature of 
turbulent flow can be calculated by equations (62) and (72). For many engineering problems, the bubble volume 
density can be calculated in this case. 
     

In fact, the zero intrinsic stress corresponds to the instability of fluid motion. For this case, one has:

Therefore, for a given fluid material, the critical condition of turbulence can be determined by equations (50) or 
(60).  It  shows that  the  critical  condition of turbulence  is  completely  determined  by  the  intrinsic  parameters  of 
fluid material. 

Theoretically, the zero intrinsic stress state requires the pressure conditions:

Therefore, for a given pressure, the critical condition of turbulence can be determined by equations (49) or (59). 
 
Summering above results, the research shows that there are three ways to determine the turbulent transition 
condition:  (1)  solving  fluid  motion  equation;  (2)  using  the  intrinsic  parameters  of  fluid  material;  (3)  using

Hence, the incompressible flow is defined by:

iS
It corresponds to zero intrinsic stress discussed in section of incompressible pure rotation flow. 
Based on this research, the incompressible flow can be divided into the addition of a pure rotation and a 
 
volume  expanding  caused  by  local  average  rotation.  Hence,  the  traditional  definition  of  impressible  flow  is 
correct when the local average rotation angle is small. 
 

For incompressible Newton fluid, the traditional Navier-Stokes equation is:

At present stage, the related results are only theoretic. The further experimental research is waiting to be 

The research presented here is focused on the physical foundation of fluid motion equation. By introducing 
 
the  Chen’s  S+R  decomposition,  the  research  shows  that  for  Newton  fluid,  whether  it  is  incompressible  or 
compressible  in  traditional  definition,  the  local  average  rotation  always  produces  an  additional  pressure 
equivalent  item  in  the  traditional  Navier-Stokes  equation.  This  item  is  deterministic  rather  than  stochastic  (as 
Reynolds stress) or adjustable (as exposed by this paper). The research have supplied a solvable mathematical 
model for the calculation of velocity and pressure when suitable boundary condition is adapted. 
 
The research shows that the Navier-Stokes equation is good approximation for average flow, so it can not 
solve  the  turbulent  problem  in  essential  sense.  However,  this  conclusion  does  not  deny  that  with  suitable 
additional  condition  for  special  engineering  problem  it  is  still  a  would-be  acceptable  approximation.  The 
research shows that the classical Navier-Stokes equation does not meet the requirement of angular momentum 
conservation, which is apparently ignored for infinitesimal velocity gradient of fluid. The research concludes that: 
(a)  large  velocity  gradient  flow  (no  matter  it  is  steady  or  non-steady)  will  produce  non-symmetric  stress;  (b) 
un-steady flow (no matter it is infinitesimal or not) will produce non-symmetric stress. The non-symmetric stress 
produces local rotation. When the local rotation is big enough, the flow will become turbulent flow. The research 
shows that there are three ways to determine the turbulent transition condition: (1) solving fluid motion equation; 
(2) using the intrinsic parameters of fluid material; (3) using pressure condition with given material parameters. 
Therefore, the essential feature turbulent flow is well described in this research.

Hence,  the  transformation

By  these  equations, 

jF   can  be  explained  as  the  extended-Kronecker-delta  in  that  it’s  the  dot  product  of 
contra-variant base vector in initial configuration and covariant base vector in current configuration. When the 
two configurations are the same, it becomes the standard Kronecker-delta. For the 
jG , similar interpretation can

be made. 

From  these  equations  to  see,  geometrically,  it  is  found  that  the

vector with the initial contra-variant base vector as reference. When stress tensor is defined as:

Its  mechanic  meaning  can  be  explained  as  the  lower  index  represents  component  of  surface  force  in  current 
direction, and the upper index represents the initial surface normal which surface force acts on. It takes the initial 
surface as surface force reference.   
 

jG measures the initial covariant base vector with the current contra-variant base vector as reference. 
The  corresponding  stress  can  be  explained  as  the  lower  index  represents  component  of  surface  force  in  initial 
direction, and the upper index represents the current surface normal which surface force acts on. 
 
For such a kind of mixture tensor, it is defined on the same point with different configurations (that is initial 
and current). So, the name of two-point tensor given by C Truessdell is not correct. This mis-interpretation has 
caused many doubts cast on the feature of transformation tensor. Some mathematician even said that the mixture 
tensor is meaningless.   
 
However, during treating the non-symmetric field theory, Einstein believes that the use of mixture tensor is 
more  reasonable  that  the  pure  covariant  or  pure  contra-variant  tensor.  Recently,  the  concept  of  bi-tensor  is 

 

  13

introduced in physics topic. So, we have sound reason to use mixture tensor in continuum mechanics, as it can 
give clear physical meaning for the definition of stress.

Although it is acceptable in form for the special case of taking Cartesian system as the initial coordinator system, 
the intrinsic meaning of deformation tensor is completely destroyed by such a formulation. That may be the main 
reason for the rational mechanics constructed by C Truessdell et al in 1960s. 
 
Mathematically,  once  the  initial  gauge  field  is  selected,  the  current  gauge  field  is  to  be  obtained  by  the 
given  physical  deformation.  In  this  sense,  the  current  gauge  field  is  viewed  as  the  physical  field.  So,  the 
covariant differentiation is taken respect with the initial configuration. 
 
Truessdell  argued  that  the  covariant  differentiation  should  be  taken  one  index  in  initial  configuration, 
another  index  in  current  configuration.  This  concept  had  strongly  effects  on  the  development  of  infinite 
deformation mechanics. Such a kind of misunderstanding indeed is caused by the equations (A17-18).

For the displacement field defined in the initial co-moving dragging coordinator system, the displacement 
or  rotation  of  continuum  as  a  rigid  whole  body  has  no  contribution  to  the  intrinsic  deformation.  So  we  only 
consider  the  conservation  related  with  deformation.  In  the  co-moving  dragging  coordinator  system,  the  linear 
momentum conservation can be expressed in integral form as:

For large deformation, as the lower index of stress represents its component in current configuration, so the 

 
equation (B-9-2) is related with the velocity in current configuration.

jσ   is symmetric, the equation (B-9-3)

will require that the deformation 

jF   must be symmetric. However, this can be true only for steady fluid motion.

Therefore, the motion equation of deformation expressed by displacement field 

iU is: 

 
So,  even  for  large  deformation,  the  steady  stress  must  be  symmetric,  and  hence,  the  steady  deformation 
must be symmetric. The conclusion is that the traditional fluid dynamics theory is correct. However, for dynamic 
fluid motion, it is correct only for infinitesimal deformation.   
In  classical  infinitesimal  deformation  fluid  motion,

In fact, the equations form the bases of traditional Newton fluid motion theory. 
 
 
For  fluid  material  motion,  instant  commoving  dragging  coordinator  system  can  be  taken  to  define  the 
instant fluid material. In this case, the inertial coordinator can be used to define the initial commoving dragging 
coordinator  system.  By  this  definition,  the  rate  of  base  vector  has  contribution  to  the  Lagrange  time 
differentiation. For simplicity, the inertial coordinator system can be selected as standard rectangular.

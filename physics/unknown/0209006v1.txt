Limitations in predicting student performance
on standardized tests
Michael C. Wittmann, University of Maine, Orono ME 04469-5709, wittmann@umit.maine.edu

The Maryland Physics Expectations Survey (MPEX) describes student attitudes and expec-
tations toward learning, and might be used to predict normalized gains on tests such as the
Force and Motion Concept Evaluation (FMCE). These predictions are incomplete, though,
due to limitations of the standardized tests themselves. I illustrate the problems involved in
using the MPEX to predict productive attitudes toward learning physics by focusing on two
students, both with seemingly appropriate expectations toward learning. While one had high
normalized gains, the other did not, due to "false favorable" responses on the MPEX.

Introduction

One way in which physics education
research might add value to instruction is
by  using  standardized  tests  to  predict
student  learning  in  a  course  (and  tune
instruction  to  an  appropriate  impedance
match). Research-based standardized tests
such  as  the  Force  and  Motion  Concept
Evaluation  (FMCE)1  could  be  used  to
measure  the  success  of  our  teaching,
while tests such as the Maryland Physics
Expectations  Survey  (MPEX)2  could  be
used to predict if students have the appro-
priate attitudes and expectations for suc-
cessful conceptual learning (as measured
by the FMCE). In this paper, I describe a
study  in  which  the  normalized  gains  on
the  FMCE  were  compared  to  student
responses  on  the  MPEX.  The  data  indi-
cate that, at times, one can predict FMCE
gains  with  the  MPEX,  while  at  other
times  there  are  "false  favorables"  in  the
MPEX  which  lead  to  inaccurate  predic-
tions of student gains on the FMCE.
Class Results

The study was carried out at the Uni-
versity  of  Maine  in  a  sophomore  level
mechanics  course  for  which  differential
equations was a corequisite course. Ten
students were given the MPEX and then
the  FMCE  on  the  first  day  of  class  and
again on the very last day of class. In both
cases,  they  were  not  aware  that  they
would be tested. During post-instruction
testing,  students  commented  that  they

remembered the tests, but not the individ-
ual questions.3

Student  performance  on  the  FMCE
before  instruction  was  weak,  and  their
normalized gains were low (see Figure 1).
This  is  consistent  with  other  courses  in
which little active learning is used.1 Since
there  are  no  published  FMCE  data  for
advanced  physics  classes,  it  is  hard  to
compare  these  data  to  other  similar
classes.  There  are  several  published  re-
sults1 in which higher scores and gains are
shown for introductory physics courses in
which active learning was used.

Results on the MPEX (see Figure 2)
were much more positive. Where students
at  the  end  of  a  typical  introductory  se-
quence of physics instruction have scores

roughly  at  (25,  50)  for  (unfavorable,
favorable) responses on the MPEX, these
students  had  better  scores  initially  (pre:
14, 65). Notably, their MPEX results did
not  deteriorate  during  the  course  of  the
semester.  Instead,  student  responses  be-
came less neutral (post: 20, 68), including
more  favorable  and  unfavorable  re-
sponses. Little work has been done with
the MPEX in advanced courses to know if
these results are typical or anomalous.

normalization movement is the possible
movement to a perfectly favorable score,

MPEX as an accurate predictor
For some students, the MPEX score
can  predict  normalized  gains  on  the
FMCE. Student A was a weak student in
the course who had great difficulty con-
necting the mathematical formalism with
the  physical  descriptions.  He  began  the
semester  with  highly  favorable  MPEX
responses, and his overall score improved
slightly from (9,79) to (9, 91) during the
semester  (see  Figure  3).  Only  on  the
Coherence  cluster  did  he  show  no  im-
provement (pre and post: 20, 80). In two
clusters  (Concepts  and  Reality  link)  he
began and ended the semester with per-
fectly favorable scores. In other clusters
(Math link and Independence), he ended

the semester with perfect scores. Scores,
especially in the Concepts, Reality link,
and Independence clusters, were consis-
tent with his classroom behavior and my
out-of-class  interactions  with  him.  Stu-
dent  A's  MPEX  scores  suggest  that  the
student was capable of great improvement
in his understanding of the physics.

This  prediction  is  borne  out  in  his
FMCE  scores  (see  Figure  4).    Though
they began relatively low, they improved
greatly  in  three  key  areas  (acceleration,
Newton's 1st and 2nd laws, and Newton's
3rd  law).  The  student's  homework  and
examination scores were consistent with
these  results.  Conceptual  understanding
of  the  physics  improved  greatly;  and
mathematical  understanding  lagged  be-
hind, but also increased.
False  favorables  in  the  MPEX
and inaccurate predictions

Though  Student  A's  results  suggest
that a favorable MPEX score is an accu-
rate predictor of an FMCE gain, a second
example  contradicts 
this  conclusion.
Student  B  was  weak  in  physics  and
mathematics.  Her  MPEX  scores  at  the
beginning of the semester were not unfa-
vorable,  though  not  perfectly  favorable.
Her overall score changed from (3, 58) to

(6, 85) during the semester, indicating a
strong improvement in favorable attitudes
toward  learning  physics.  She  ended  the
semester with perfectly favorable scores
in several clusters (Independence, Reality
link,  Math  link),  and  showed  great  im-
provement in Coherence (0, 40 to 20, 80)
and Concepts (0, 40 to 0, 80). The nor-
malized  movement  of  her  responses  is
shown  in  Figure  5.  The  general  lack  of
change  in  unfavorable  responses  corre-
sponds to the fact that she gave no unfa-
vorable  responses  on  the  MPEX  before
instruction.

Comments made by student B on the
MPEX  question  sheet  give  reason  to
question her responses to the Likert-scale
questions  She  often  gave  favorable  re-
sponses  for  unfavorable  reasons.  For
example, she (favorably) disagreed with
the question, "All I need to do to under-
stand  most  of  the  basic  ideas  in  this
course is just read the text, work most of
the problems, and/or pay close attention
in  class,"  and  wrote  “Work  all  of  the
problems (and do all of that and more).”
The  response  was  favorable,  but  the
comment indicated unfavorable attitudes.
The  comment  was  consistent  with  be-
havior in class and on homework, where
she worked all the assigned and additional
other end-of-chapter problems by crank-
ing through the math without interpreting

The  student  also  (favorably)  dis-
agreed  with  the  statement  "In  doing  a
physics problem, if my calculation gives
a  result  that  differs  significantly  from
what I expect, I’d have to trust the calcu-
lation."  Here,  the  student  wrote,  “Very
funny. I just go back and try something
else.” The response was favorable, but the
comment  reflected  strongly  unfavorable
behavior. In class, the student would see
a  mistake  and  start  the  problem  over,
without  evaluating  why  it  might  have
gone wrong or checking the steps of the
problem.
 
Student  B's  performance  on  the
FMCE was the worst in the course. At the
start  of  the  semester,  only  one  question
was  answered  correctly,  in  the  velocity
cluster of questions. Both at the start and
the end of the semester, she had typical
incorrect  responses  in  which  she,  for
example, confused the velocity and accel-
eration  of  a  coin  tossed  in  the  air.  She
improved (notably in the energy cluster,
which  does  not  count  to  the  overall
score4),  but  had  extremely  low  scores
even after instruction.

If one chose to trust the MPEX results
(by ignoring the student's comments), one
might  assume  that  her  pre-instruction

knowledge  of  force  and  motion  was  so
low that little gain was possible, even in
light of favorable attitudes toward learn-
ing. But, in light of the student's MPEX
comments, it is more likely that the stu-
dent  had  unfavorable  attitudes  toward
learning the material. The false favorable
responses on the MPEX otherwise lead to
an  incorrect  prediction  of  student  B's
possible gains on the FMCE.
Discussion

In this paper, I hope to have shown
that the MPEX is an incomplete predictor
of  possible  gains  on  tests  such  as  the
FMCE. False favorables are most likely
only  one  example  of  problematic  re-
sponses to the MPEX. Additional research
on the interplay between student attitudes
and learning is needed to create a test that
avoids false favorables and other possible
problems.  More  importantly,  a  reliance
solely on standardized tests is inadequate
when attempting to explore the richness
of possible student responses and attitudes
toward learning.

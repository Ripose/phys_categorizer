We review recent PIC simulation results which show that double-sided irradiation of a thin over-
dense plasma slab by ultra-intense laser pulses from both sides can lead to sustained comoving 
acceleration of surface electrons to energies  much higher  than the  conventional ponderomotive 
limit.    The  acceleration  stops  only  when  the  electrons  drift  transversely  out  of  the  laser  beam.  
We  show  latest  2.5D  results  of  parameter  studies  based  on  finite  laser  spot  size  and  discuss 
future laser experiments that can be used to test these results.

1. Introduction 

 

of 

the 

propagation 

Recent advances in ultra-intense short-pulse lasers (ULs) [1,2] open up new frontiers 
on  particle  acceleration  via  ultra-strong  electromagnetic  (EM)  fields  [3].    Most 
conventional  laser  acceleration  schemes  (e.g.  LWFA,  PWFA,  PBWA  [4],  FWA  [5]) 
involve 
plasma 
lasers 
(ωpe=(4πne2/me)1/2<ωo=2πc/λ,  λ=laser  wavelength,  n=electron  density).      In  such 
schemes  the  acceleration  gradient  (energy  gain/distance)  [4]  and  energetic  particle 
beam intensity are limited by the laser frequency due to the underdense requirement.  
Here  we  review  PIC  simulation  results  of  a  radically  different  concept:  comoving 
acceleration of overdense (ωpe>ωo) plasmas using colliding UL pulses. In this case the 
acceleration  gradient  and  particle  beam  intensity  are  not  limited  by  the  underdensity 
condition.   This colliding pulses accelerator (CLPA) mechanism may have important 
applications complementary to those of underdense laser acceleration schemes.

in 

Consider  an  intense  EM  pulse  with  Ωe(=aoωo=eBo/mec,  ao=normalized  vector 
potential)>ωpe initially imbedded inside an overdense plasma (ωpe>>ωo).  When it tries 
to  escape,  it  induces  a  diamagnetic  skin  current  J  that  inhibits  the  EM  field  from 
leaving.    The  resultant  J  x  B  (ponderomotive)  force  then  accelerates  the  surface 
plasma  to  follow  the  EM  pulse.    As  the  EM  pulse  “pulls”  the  surface  plasma,  it  is 
slowed  by  plasma  loading  (group  velocity  <  c),  allowing  the  fastest  particles  to 
comove  with  the  EM  field.    But  since  slower  particles  eventually  fall  behind,  the 
plasma  loading  decreases  and  the  EM  pulse  accelerates  with  time.    A  dwindling 
number of fast particles also get  accelerated indefinitely by the comoving EM force, 
reaching  maximum  Lorentz    factors  greater  than  the  usual  ponderomotive  limit  [6] 
2/2  >>(Ωe/ωpe)2.  This novel phenomenon is called the diamagnetic relativistic 
γmax> ao
pulse  accelerator  (DRPA)  [7].    DRPA  is  strictly  a  nonlinear,  collective,  relativistic 
phenomenon,  with  no  analog  in  the  weak  field  (Ωe/ωpe<1),  low  density  (ωo>ωpe)  or

test  particle  limit.    Here  we  discuss  a  laser  acceleration  scheme  based  on  the  DRPA 
concept. 

2. Colliding Pulses Acceleration Mechanism 

Since the discovery of DRPA from PIC simulations, a key question has been how to 
reproduce  it  in  the  laboratory,  as  vacuum  EM  waves  cannot  penetrate  an  overdense 
plasma  beyond  the  relativistic  skin  depth  [8].    Fig.1  shows  the  PIC  simulation  of  a 
single UL irradiating an overdense  e+e- plasma.  All upstream plasma is snowplowed 
by  the  UL,  and  the  terminal  maximum  Lorentz  factor  γmax~(Ωe/ωpe)2.  The  relativistic 
mass increase [8] is countered by density increase due to compression, and the plasma 
stays  overdenseat  all  times,  preventing  the  UL  from  penetrating.    Hence  the  DRPA 
initial  condition  cannot  be  achieved  using  a  single  UL  pulse.    Here  we  report  PIC 
simulations  with  the  2.5D  (2D-space,  3-momenta)  ZOHAR  code  [9],  which 
demonstrate  that  DRPA-like  sustained  comoving  acceleration    can  be  achieved  by 
irradiating a thin slab of overdense  e+e- plasma  with UL pulses from opposite sides.  
The opposing UL pulses accomplish this by first compressing the overdense plasma to 
a total thickness < 2 relativistic skin depths [8].  At that point the UL pulses “tunnel” 
through the plasma, despite its overdensity even allowing for relativistic effect (ωpe > 
<γ>ωo,  <γ>=mean  Lorentz  factor  of  the  compressed  plasma).    The  physics  of  the 
subsequent evolution after transmission is similar to that of the DRPA [7]. 

 
Fig.1.  PIC  simulation  shows  that  a  single  UL  pulse  (I(λ/µm)2=1021W/cm2,  cτ=λ/2)  snowplows  an 
overdense (no=15ncr, thickness = λ/2, kT=2.6keV) e+e- plasma but cannot penetrate it.  We plot By; n/ncr  
(B) and px/mc (black dots) vs. x at tωo/2π =  20.  The slab thickness remains >> relativistic skin depth at 
all times.  The maximum Lorentz factor γmax~(Ωe/ωpe)2~40 at late times [16].

an  overdense    e+e-  plasma  (no=15ncr,  thickness  =  λ/2,  kT=2.6keV)  from  opposite  sides.  We  plot 
magnetic  field  By(medium),  electric  field  Ez(light),  current  density  Jz(dark)  and  px/mc  vs.  x  (inset)  at 
tωo/2π =  (a)1.25,  (b)1.5,  (c)1.75;  (d)  Snapshots  of  px/mec  vs.  x  (dots)  for  the  right-moving  pulse  at

the profiles of By(medium), Ez(light) at tωo/2π=22.5. [16] 

 
Fig.2 shows the evolution of two linearly polarized plane half-cycle EM pulses with 
parallel  B,  irradiating  a  thin  e+e-  slab  from  opposite  sides  (thickness=λ/2,  initial 
density  no=15ncr(critical  density)).    Cases  with  nonparallel  B  are  more  complex  and 
are  still  under  investigation.    Each  incident  pulse  compresses  and  accelerates  the 
plasma  inward  (Fig.2a),  reaching  a  terminal  Lorentz  factor  γmax~(Ωe/ωpe)2~40  as  in 
Fig.1.  Only  ~10%  of  the  incident  EM  amplitudes  is  reflected  because  the  laser 
reflection  front  is  propagating  inward  relativistically  [10].    As  the  relativistic  skin 
depths from both sides  start to merge (Fig.2b), the two UL pulses interpenetrate and 
tunnel  through  the  plasma,  despite  ωpe > <γ>1/2ωo.    Such  transmission  of  EM  waves 

 

through an overdense plasma could not be achieved using a single UL pulse, because 
there  the  plasma  thickness  remains  >>  2  relativistic  skin  depths  (Fig.1).    During 
transmission, the B fields of the opposing pulses add while E fields cancel  (Fig.2b), 
setting  up  a  state  similar  to  the  DRPA  initial  state,  and  the  subsequent  evolution 
resembles  the  DRPA  [7].    As  the  transmitted  UL  pulses  reemerge  from  the  plasma, 
they  induce  new  drift  currents  J  at  the  trailing  edge  of  the  pulses  (Fig.2c),  with 
opposite  signs  to  the  initial  currents  (Fig.2b),  so  that  the  new  J  x  B  forces  pull  the 
surface  plasmas  outward.    We  emphasize  that  the  plasma  loading  which  slows  the 
transmitted  UL  pulses  plays  a  crucial  role  in  sustaining  this  comoving  acceleration.  
As  we  see  in  the  parameter  study  below,  for  a  given  Ωe/ωpe  the  higher  the  plasma 
density,  the  more  sustained  the  comoving  acceleration,  and  a  larger  fraction  of  the 
plasma  slab  is  accelerated.      This  unique  feature  distinguishes  this  overdense 
acceleration  scheme  from  other  underdense  schemes  [4,5].    As  slower  particles 
gradually  fall  behind  the  UL  pulses,  the  plasma  loading  of  the  UL  pulses  decreases 
with  time.    This  leads  to  continuous  acceleration  of  both  the  UL  pulses  and  the 
dwindling population of trapped fast particles .  The phase space evolution (Fig.2d) of 
this colliding pulses accelerator  (CLPA) resembles that of the DRPA [7]. 

 
3. Acceleration by Gaussian Pulse Trains 

 

 

The  above  example  using  half-cycle  UL  pulses  is  only  for  illustration.    Fig.3  shows 
the  results  of  irradiating  an  overdense  e+e-  slab  using  more  realistic  Gaussian  pulse 
trains  (λ=1µm,  pulse  length  τ=85fs,  Ipeak=1021Wcm-2).  We  see  that  γmax  increases 
rapidly to 2200 by 1.28ps and 3500 by 2.56ps, far exceeding the ponderomotive limit 
2/2  (~360).  The  maximum  Lorentz  factor  increases  with  time  according  to 
ao
γmax(t)~e∫E(t)dt/mc.  E(t)  is  the  UL  electric  field  comoving  with  the  highest  energy 
particles.    E(t)  decreases  with  time  due  to  EM  energy  transfer  to  the  particles,  plus 
slow dephasing of particles from the UL pulse peak. This leads to γmax  growth slower 
than linear and γmax ~t0.8 (Fig.3b). In practice, γmax will be limited by the diameter D of 
the laser focal spot, since particles drift transversely out of the laser field after t~D/c. 
The maximum energy of any comoving acceleration is thus < eEoD=6GeV(I/1021Wcm-
2)1/2(D/100µm).  The asymptotic momentum distribution forms a power-law with slope  
~ –1 (Fig.3d) below γmax, distinct from the exponential distribution of ponderomotive 
heating  [11,12].  We  speculate  that  a  quasi-power-law  momentum  distribution  is 
formed  below  γmax  since  there  is  no  other  preferred  energy  scale  below  γmax,  and  the 
particles have random phases with respect to the EM field profile.

4. Parameter Studies 

We  have  performed  extensive  parameter  studies  of  the  CLPA.  Since  γmax  is  not  the 
only figure of merit in comparing acceleration efficiency here we compare the overall 
particle energy distributions at equal times for different runs.  Fig4a shows the effects 
of varying vector potential ao while fixing other parameters.  Both the power-law slope

and γmax increase with ao. Fig4b shows the effect of increasing the pulse length τ while 
fixing  other  parameters.    We  see  that  at  first  γmax  increases  and  the  power-law  slope 
stays ~constant, but for very long pulses γmax becomes fixed while the slope hardens. 
Fig4c shows the effect of varying the target density n while fixing other parameters.  
For  comparison  we  include  the  result  of  an  underdense  example  (n=10-3ncr  bottom 
curve). While all three cases produce similar γmax, the underdense case shows a smaller 
fraction  of  particles  being  accelerated,    because  the  plasma  loading  is  too  low  to 
effectively slow down the UL pulses.  The physics of the underdense CLPA may be 
related  to  the  free  wave  accelerator  (FWA  [5]),  where  we  substitute  the  symmertry-
breaking  electrostatic/magnetostatic  field  [5]  with  an  opposing  laser.    But  as  Fig.4c 
shows,  the  overdense  CLPA  is  more  effective  in  terms  of  energy  coupling  and  the 
fraction of plasma accelerated.

Fig.2. [16] 

We  have  also  studied  the  effects  of  unequal  intensities  from  the  opposing  laser 
pulses. Fig.4d illustrates the case in which a thin plasma slab is irradiated by a UL of 
1021 Wcm-2 from the right and 8x1020 Wcm-2 from the left.  We  see that most of the 
particles are trapped and accelerated by the right-moving pulse while the left-moving 
pulse decouples from the plasma early, leading to little trapping or acceleration.  
 
 
5. Proposed Laser Experiment 

 

An  experimental  demonstration  of  the  CLPA  will  require  a  dense  and  intense  e+e- 
source.  Cowan  et  al  [13]  demonstrated  that  such  an  e+e-  source  can  be  achieved  by 
using  a  PW  laser  striking  a  gold  foil.    Theoretical  works  [14]  suggest  that  e+e- 
densities  >1022cm-3  may  be  achievable  with  sufficient  laser  fluence.    Such  a  high 
density e+e- jet can be slit-collimated to produce a ~ micron thick e+e- slab, followed 
by 2-sided irradiation with opposite UL pulses.   As an example, consider UL pulses 
with τ=80fs and intensity=1019Wcm-2.  We need focal spot diameter D>600 µm for the 
pairs  to  remain  inside  the  beam  for  >1ps.    This  translates  into  ~1KJ  energy  per  UL 
pulse.    Such  high-energy  UL’s  are  currently  under  construction  at  many  sites  [2].  
Fig.5 shows the artist conception of such an experiment setup.

6. Electron-ion Plasmas 
 
We have also begun investigating the CLPA concept for e-ion plasmas.  Preliminary 
results  suggest  that,  for  very  thin  e-ion  plasma  slabs  which  can  be  compressed  to  <

two  relativistic  skin  depths,  the  CLPA  concept  remains  viable.    Most  energy  is 
eventually transferred to ions via charge separation, similar to the e-ion DRPA [7,15]. 
Fig.6 compares CLPA runs for e-ion plasmas at  different ion densities.  We see that 
the higher the ion density, the  stronger the charge-separation electric fields dragging 
the  electrons.  So  there  must  be  a  trade-off  between  plasma  loading  which  slows  the 
UL pulses, and the ion drag which slows the electron component.  Details remain to be 
investigated. Though the previous results reported are based on 2.5D simulations, new 
3D results confirm the stability and robustness of the CLPA concept.

(thickness=λ/2)  of  e-ion  plasma  is  irradiated  from  both  sides  by  the  same  UL  pulses  as  in  Fig.2.    At 
high  densities  most  of  the  energy  is  transferred  to  the  ions  via  charge  separation  and  the  ion  drag  on 
electrons allows only a small fraction of electrons to comove with the UL pulses.  At low densities ion 
acceleration is negligible and most of the electrons are freely accelerated as in the e+e- case.  Critical 
density is equal to 0.6 in these units. [17] 
 
 
7. Effects of Finite Laser Spot Size 

 

 

8 

 
The above results were obtained with infinite linearized plane wave laser pulses, with 
periodic  boundary  in  y  (here  B  is  along  z).    Using  the  ZOHAR  code  [9]  we  have 
recently performed 2.5-D simulations with finite laser spot size in the y direction.  Fig. 
7 gives one sample of such runs with laser spot diameter D=8 microns.  We see that 
despite the finite spot size, the compression (upper left panel) and re-explosion (lower 
left panel) of the opposing laser pulses are stable at least in 2.5D.  Most importantly, 
the particles along the laser axis are trapped and efficiently accelerated, and the late-
time phase diagram (lower middle panel) resembles the infinite plane wave results of 
Fig.2.    We  do  however  observe  a  small  amount  of  charge  separation  between  the 
electrons and positrons as evidenced by the slight asymmetry in the space distribution 
of the particles (upper middle and right panels).  However this small charge separation 
in  y-direction  ,  which  is  expected  intuitively  due  to  the  finite  extent  of  the  laser  Ey 
field,  does  not  seem  to  affect  the  longitudinal  acceleration  in  the  x  direction  in  any 
major way.   We have also performed electron-ion simulations with finite laser spots 
and the results are similar to those in Fig.6.

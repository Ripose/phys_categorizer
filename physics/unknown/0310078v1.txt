I. INTRODUCTION 

 

Over  the  past  four  decades  comprehensive experimental studies were performed on 

Hall 

thrusters.1,2,3  However,  near-anode  processes  have  not  received  sufficient 

experimental scrutiny. Recent theoretical models suggest that Hall thrusters may operate 

with  or  without  a  negative  anode  sheath.4,5  The  near-anode  processes  might  then  affect 

the overall operation of a Hall thruster. For example, a change of the voltage drop in the 

anode sheath might affect anode heating, propellant ionization,6 or the beam divergence 

inside and outside the thruster. 

Similar  to  the  experimental  studies  of  the sheath and presheath in low-pressure gas 

discharges,7  the  plasma  parameters  in  the  near-anode  region  can  also  be  studied  by 

various  electrostatic  probe  techniques,  including  single,  double  and  emissive  probes. 

However,  the  implementation  of  conventional  plasma  diagnostics  for  measurements 

inside  the  Hall  thruster  channel  is  complicated by its relatively small size and obstacles 

imposed by thruster structures, in particular by the magnetic circuit. Stationary probes are 

limited  to  measurements  near  the  outer  channel  wall.  However,  introducing  movable 

probes  axially  into  the  acceleration  region,  with  Te  ~  20  eV,  can  cause  significant 

perturbations to the Hall thruster discharge.8,9,10 This might cause an inaccuracy of up to 

several  volts  in  the  measured  plasma  potential,  which  is  of  the  order  of  the  expected 

potential change over the entire near-anode region.  

As we show in this paper, this significant disadvantage of movable probe diagnostics 

vanishes if the probe is introduced radially into the near-anode region and does not pass 

through  the  acceleration  region.  It  does  not  cause  significant  perturbations  to  the 

discharge or get severely damaged, because the electron temperature and plasma density 

 

2

in the near-anode region are low. For the same reason, the probe residence time is not an 

issue.  Therefore,  radial  probe  insertion  does  not  require  building  an  expensive  and 

complex high-speed positioning system.11 

 

The  near-anode  region  in  Hall  thrusters  is  typically  about  1-2  cm  long.  Plasma 

density, n ~ 1010 - 1011 cm-3, electron temperature, Te ~ 3 - 5 eV, and their variations in 

the  near-anode  region  are  smaller  than  in  the  acceleration  region.  The  magnetic  field  is 

also  much  smaller,  so  the  electron  flux  towards  the  anode  is  mainly  affected  by  the 

electron pressure gradients, 

 ~ 10 V/cm.

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Technical  questions  specific  for  near-anode 

measurements  in  Hall  thrusters  are  discussed  in  Section  II.  Section  III  describes  the 

diagnostic setup built for the characterization of a near-anode region inside a 2 kW Hall 

thruster. In Section IV, we present testing results for biased and emissive probes. 

 

II. NEAR-ANODE MEASUREMENTS 

The  anode  sheath  thickness  is  typically  assumed  to  be  a  few  Debye  lengths,  where 

05.0~l

mm

D

.  Such  a  thin  sheath  does  not  easily  accommodate  probe  diagnostics.  The 

information  about  overall  voltage  drop  in  the  sheath,  however,  can  be  obtained through 

probing plasma in the presheath, at several millimeters from the anode.  

The  absolute  value  of  the  sheath  voltage  drop  is  not  expected  to  exceed  20V.  The 

overall potential drop over the near-anode region is expected to be of the order of several 

volts.  Therefore,  uncertainties  in  interpreting  the  measured  voltage  are  significantly 

decreased if plasma potential is measured relative to the anode rather than to the ground 

or  the  cathode.  In  Hall  thrusters,  the  potential  of  the  anode  relative  to  the  ground  is 

 

3

several  hundred  volts.  Therefore,  anode-referenced  measurements  require  the  use  of 

isolation amplifiers, which typically have DC-offsets. The calibration of amplifiers used 

in  probe  circuits  showed  that  these  offsets  depend  on  the  input  load  impedance,  the 

discharge voltage, the mass flow rate and especially on the choice of reference potential. 

The maximum input signal for commercial isolation amplifiers is typically 10 Volts, 

which  necessitates  the  use  of  voltage  dividers.  For  floating  and  plasma  potential 

measurements  with  a  floating  emissive  probe,  the  impedance  of the divider, 

divR , must 

be  much 

larger 

than 

the 

impedance  of

interface,

 (ratio of electron temperature to ion saturation current and electron 

charge),  to  minimize  the  leakage  current  through  the  probe  circuit.  For  certain  Hall 

thruster  operating  regimes,

R

  can  reach  1  Mohm  in  the  near-

sheath

anode  plasma,  yielding 

divR   must  be  hundreds  of  mega-ohms.  In  anode-referenced 

measurements,  such  a  large  load  impedance  causes  the  DC-offset  of  up  to  hundreds  of 

millivolts,  which  can  be  of  the  order  of  overall  changes  of  the  measured  signal.  

Therefore, for emissive probe measurements the ground appears to be a better reference 

than the anode, unlike for a single biased probe.  

Another source of leakage current in a probe circuit can be the plasma collected by 

electrical connectors, which couple the probe wire, the extension cable and the electrical 

feed-through mounted on a flange of a vacuum vessel. Wrapping all connectors in Teflon 

tape and closing the face of the flange with the graphite foil eliminates this problem. This 

was  shown  by  placing  a  test  wire  with  the  tip  stripped  from  insulation  and  wrapped  in 

Teflon  tape  inside  the  vacuum  vessel.  The  wire  was  connected  to  the  emissive  probe 

 

4

circuitry  (Fig.  2.  b)  and  it  measured  zero  floating  potential  at  all  thruster  operating 

regimes.  

 

III. DIAGNOSTIC SETUP 

 The 2 kW Hall thruster and test facility used in this study are described in Ref. 11. 

Fig.  1  shows  a  diagnostic  setup  for  near-anode  measurements  and  the  probe  locations 

relative  to  the  thruster  channel.  The  probe  holder,  which  can  accommodate  up  to  three 

plain electrostatic or hot emissive probes simultaneously, is mounted on a CVI precision 

rotary stage and a Newport linear stage for fine pitch and height adjustment of the probe 

relative  to  the  thruster  channel.  These  manually  controlled  stages  are  assembled  on  a 

Velmex  motor-driven  X-Y  linear  positioning  stage,  equipped  with  two  400-steps/rev 

step-motors,  two  40-rev/inch  high  precision  lead  screws  and  two  5  mm-resolution 

Renishaw  optical  encoders.  This  motor-driven  stage  is  mounted  on  an  additional  CVI 

rotary  stage  for  a  fine  yaw  adjustment,  which is fixed on an aluminum breadboard near 

the  thruster  mounting  table.  Probes  can  be  introduced  into  the  thruster  through  a  2mm 

wide  and  10  mm  long  axial  slot  starting  at  2  mm  from  the  anode,  made  in  the  outer 

ceramic  wall  of  the  thruster  channel.  The  motor-driven  positioning  stage  allows  probe 

motion  along  the  slot  between  the  inner  and  the  outer  channel  walls.  Control  of  the 

positioning  system  and  the  signal  measurements  are  performed  by  a  National 

Instruments, PC-based, data acquisition system PCI-DIO-16-1. 

 The  biased  flat  probe  is  constructed  of  0.76  mm  diameter  thoriated  tungsten  rod, 

covered  by  a  high  purity  alumina  single  bore  tube  with  outer  diameter  of  1.3  mm  and 

inner diameter of 0.79mm (Fig. 1). The probe collecting surface area, 

Apr =

45.0

mm

, is 

2

 

5

much smaller than the anode cross-sectional area, 

Aan =

7700 mm

, so the collection of 

2

electrons by the probe, placed near the anode, does not affect the discharge. The overall 

probe length is 165 mm. The tungsten rod is coupled to the coaxial cable (silicon coated 

for vacuum compatibility) through the regular copper connector. The planar tip geometry 

was chosen because, in the near-anode region, the voltage-current characteristics of a flat 

probe  appear  to  have  more  distinctive  electron  and  ion  saturation  than  those  of  a 

cylindrical  probe.  The  probe  sheath  expansion  and  particle  orbital  motion  are  likely  to 

account for this fact.12   

The probe is biased relative to the anode with a KEPCO bipolar power supply BP200-

1M,  which  is  programmed  with  a  one  cycle  sinusoidal  signal  by  a  PC-based  function-

generator  connected  through  a  Burr  Brown  isolation  amplifier  ISO124P  (Fig.  2  a).  A 

high-voltage  vacuum  switch  is  used  to  manually  switch  between  500  W  and  100  KW 

shunts  for  measurements  of  electron  and  ion  parts  of  the  probe  voltage-current 

characteristic,  respectively.  The  probe  current, 

PRI

,  and  biasing  voltage, 

BV ,  are 

measured through Analog Devices isolation amplifiers AD210AN. 

The  emissive  probe  is  constructed  of  a  0.1  mm  diameter  thorriated  tungsten  wire 

covered  by  a  1.6  mm  diameter  and  82  mm  long  high-purity  double-bore  alumina  tube. 

Each of the tube channels is filled with seven additional 0.1 mm diameter tungsten wires 

in  order  to  prevent  the  heating  of  the  probe  aside  from  the  tip.  The  probe  tip  protrudes 

from the alumina tube by 1.4 mm. The probe wires are coupled to a twisted shielded pair 

of 16 AWG wires (with a high-temperature Teflon insulation) through the regular copper 

connectors. A molybdenum tube extends the short alumina tube so that the overall probe 

length is 190 mm.  

 

6

Similar  to  Ref.  13,  the  filament  is  heated  with  a  60  cycle  half-wave  rectified 

sinusoidal  signal,  as  shown  schematically  in  Fig  2.b.  During  the  off  half-cycles  of  the 

heating  voltage,  the  voltage  drop  across  the  probe  is  assumed  to  be  zero.  An  additional 

isolation  transformer  is  placed  in  front  of  the  variac  for  noise  reduction.  The  floating 

potentials of the probe legs, F 1,  2, are measured relative to the ground through isolation 

amplifiers  AD210AN,  with  1012  W  input  and  <1 W  output  impedance.  The  isolation 

amplifiers  are  employed  here  mainly  to  provide  impedance  matching  between  dividers 

and  the  data-acquisition  system.  The  heating  voltage  can  be  deduced  from  measured 

floating potentials and the heating current,  HI

, is measured using a 0.05 W current shunt 

and Encore Electronics isolation amplifier FL644-002 with gain set to 5. 

 

IV. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 

To test if radial probe insertion disturbs the near-anode plasma, yet another, floating 

cylindrical  probe  (with  0.25  mm  wire  diameter  and  3  mm  uncovered  tip  length)  was 

introduced  into  the  channel  at  various  thruster  operating  conditions,  namely  discharge 

voltages, Vd, from 200 to 700 volts and mass flow rates,  m(cid:1) , from 2 to 4.9 mg/s. During 

the first experimental session, the probe was inserted as deep as 20 mm into the channel 

at several distances from the anode, Z = 2 – 12 mm, and left in plasma for up to 5 min. 

During the second experimental session, the probe was moved from the anode side of the 

slot,  Z  =  2  mm,  to  the  cathode  side,  Z  =  12  mm,  at  several  distances  from  the  thruster 

axis, R = 37 – 62 mm, i. e. from near the inner wall to near the outer wall. As can be seen 

from Fig. 3, the discharge current vs. time characteristics indicate that the motion of the 

probe  near  the  anode  does  not  cause  perturbations  to  the  Hall  thruster  discharge.  This 

 

7

leads  to  the  conclusion  that  radial  probe  insertion  is  suitable  for  measurements  in  the 

near-anode region of a Hall thruster.  

The  biased  and  emissive  probes  were  then  used  to  characterize  near-anode 

processes  in  Hall  thrusters.  The  biased  flat  probe  data  was  acquired  at  the  rate  of  2000 

samples per second for 6 seconds, in order to provide 12 sweeps of the biasing voltage (6 

up and 6 down) for each measurement. A biased probe voltage-current characteristic for

, smoothed over 40 points by using FFT filter and corrected 

for DC-offsets of isolation amplifiers and voltage drop over the current shunt, is given in 

Fig.  4.a.  The  measured  discharge  current  is  2.94  A,  the  plasma  potential  relative  to  the 

anode  is  –6.8  V,  the  electron  temperature  is  3.9  eV  and  the  plasma  density  is 

11105.2
(cid:215)

cm . The plasma potential and the electron saturation current were determined 

graphically  by  finding  the  knee  in  the  electron  part  of  a  probe  voltage-current 

characteristic. The electron temperature was determined by plotting 

ln( PRI

)

vs.  PRV  and 

finding  a  slope  of  the  straight  part  of  the  curve.  The  plasma  density  was  then  deduced 

from the electron saturation current and the electron temperature assuming a Maxwellian 

electron distribution function (EDF). The repeatability of the biased probe measurements 

was  estimated  graphically  by  plotting  all  probe  V-I  characteristics  acquired  in  one  data 

set  on  the  same  graph.  The  spatial  resolution  of  the  biased  probe  in  the  axial  direction 

was estimated to be the probe diameter, 0.76 mm. The effects of the magnetic field and 

the  flowing  plasma  are  believed  to  be  insignificant  for  measurements  in  the  near-anode 

region of a Hall thruster. 

The emissive probe data was acquired at the rate of 6000 samples per second for 1 

second, in order to provide 60 off half-cycles for each measurement. Fig. 4.b shows the

,  corrected  for  the  DC-offset  of  the  isolation  amplifier.  The  measured 

discharge current is 2.84 A, the plasma potential relative to the anode is –5.5 V and the 

electron temperature is 4.6 eV. The probe floating potential saturated when the amplitude 

of  the  heating  current  was  greater  than  6  A,  which  corresponds to the heating power of 

approximately  12  Watts.  The  floating  potential  of  the  hot  probe  was  averaged  over  25 

data points near the middle of the off half-cycle (to ensure zero heating current), and then 

averaged over 60 off half-cycles. The cold probe data was averaged over all 6000 points 

to  find  a  floating  potential.  The  cathode  potential  and  the  discharge  voltage  were 

measured  simultaneously  with  the  probe  floating  potential  in  order  to  deduce  the  probe 

potential relative to the anode. 

Due  to  a  potential  drop  in  the  sheath  and  pre-sheath  formed  between  the  probe 

surface  and  the  plasma,  saturated  floating  potential  of  the  emissive  probe  appears  to  be 

smaller than the plasma potential. Following Schwager,14 we can estimate the true plasma 

potential,

assumption of the Maxwellian EDF introduces an additional uncertainty in determination 

of  the  electron  temperature  (and  therefore  the  plasma  potential),  which  is  hard  to 

estimate.  

V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

Experimental results show that radial probe insertion does not cause perturbations to 

the discharge and therefore can be used for accurate near-anode measurements. Through 

probing of the 2kW Hall-thruster plasma in several radial and axial locations, near-anode 

plasma  structure  and  anode  sheath  were  successfully  characterized.15  The  experimental 

data  obtained  from  biased  and  emissive  probes  clearly  indicates  that  the  near-anode 

plasma  structure  is  essentially  two-dimensional,  and  that  the  anode  sheath  strongly 

depends  on  the  Hall  thruster  operating  conditions.  The  results  of  the  measurements  are 

currently being analyzed to provide a more complete picture of near-anode processes in a 

Hall discharge.

APPENDIX: CORRECTION TO THE FLOATING POTENTIAL OF THE EMISSIVE 

PROBE 

 

It was shown in Ref. 16 that the increase of the emissive probe temperature does not 

necessarily  lead  to  saturation  of  the  probe  floating  potential.  When  the  ratio  of  the 

emitted  current  density  to  the  collected  current  density, 

j=d

,  becomes  higher 

than the critical value, 

1~crd

, the potential well is formed near the probe surface to limit 

the  flux  of  emitted  electrons  (Fig.  5.  a).    To  estimate

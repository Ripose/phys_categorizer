Abstract:  The  present  author  has  kept  observation  for  concentrations  of 

atmospheric radon, radon progeny and thoron progeny for several years at 

the campus of Fukushima Medical University.    Accidentally, in the midst 

of an observation term, i.e., February 2005, the facility management group 

of the university changed a strategy for the manner of ventilation, probably 

because of a recession: (I) tidy everyday ventilation of 7:30-24:00 into (II) 

shortened  weekday  ventilation  of  8:00-21:00  with  weekend  halts.    This 

change  of  ventilation  manner  brought  a  clear  alteration  for 

the 

concentrations  of  radon-related  natural  radioactivity  in  indoor  air.    The 

present  paper  concerns  an  investigation  of  the  effect  of  the  ventilation 

strategy on the indoor-atmospheric radon-related radioactivity. 

Key words: radon, radon progeny, thoron, indoor air, ventilation

INTRODUCTION 

Research on natural radioactivity and natural radiation is meaningful for medical 

students and doctors.    Clarification of the behavior of radon-related radioactivity in air 
is  especially  an  issue  of  wide  importance  to  radiation  protection  1),  earthquake 
prediction 2), etc.    Radon (222Rn, half life 3.82 d) and thoron (220Rn, half life 55 s) are 

invisible  odorless  gaseous  natural  radioactive  elements  that  belong  in  uranium  series 
and thorium series, respectively 1).    World average of annual effective dose to a human 
by natural radiation 3) is 2.4 mSv and about half of which is due to internal exposure to 
progenies of 222Rn and 220Rn.    Sources of radon and thoron in indoor air are said to be 

earth and rock beneath the building, building materials, etc. 

The  present  author  has  kept  measurements  of  natural  radiation  and/or  natural 

radioactivity especially radon-related radioactivity in air in a room of the author’s office 
at  the  campus  of  Fukushima  Medical  University  4-7).    A  change  in  the  manner  of 

ventilation occurred in February 2002, probably because of a recession.    This change 

brought a considerable change for the concentrations of radon-related radioactivity. 

This  paper  investigates  the  effect  of  the  change  of  ventilation  strategy  on  the 

concentrations of atmospheric radon, radon progeny and thoron progeny. 

 

MATERIALS AND METHOD 

Pylon TEL (active static-collecting type of Lucas cell, 0.5 L/min) detected radon 

concentration, and Pylon WLx (spectroscopic method for continuously filtering with a 
membrane filter, 0.5 L/min) detected radon and thoron progeny concentrations 8).    Both 

monitors were set to output concentrations every one hour. 

Measurement was performed in a room of the author’s office (named 2nd Lab).   

The size of the room was 3.75 m ∗ 6.5 m ∗ 2.7 m = 66 m3.    The window of the room 

was never opened and the doors were shut to the utmost during the measurement.    The 

ventilation  system  of  the  university  introduces  outdoor  air  through  a  pre-filter  and  a 

main filter made of polyester and moda-acrylic fiber, respectively.    The ventilation rate 
was  130  m3/hour.    Because  of  this  strong  ventilation  system,  concentrations  of 

radon-progeny  and  thoron-progeny  in  indoor  air  were  found  to  be  less  than  those  in 
outdoor air 6). 

On  the  one  hand,  radon  concentration  never  reduces  with  any  filters  because 

radon  is  an  inert  gas.    In  fact,  recent  preliminary  study  has  shown  about  2.8  times 

higher concentration of radon in indoor air than that in outdoor air.    On the other hand, 

 
− 2 − 

radon- and thoron-progeny concentration reduces easily when they pass through some 
kind of filters because progeny are not inert gas but metal elements such as 218Po (RaA), 
214Bi  (RaB)  and  214Pb  (RaC).    Thus,  progeny  concentrations  are  anomalously  low 

under the strong ventilation system. 

To see the effect of the change of ventilation system, the data from February 2002 

to January 2003 were selected.    Just in the center of this term, the ventilation strategy 

changed  from  (I)  tidy  everyday  ventilation  of  7:30-24:00  into  (II)  shortened  weekday 

ventilation of 8:00-21:00 with weekend halts.    Figure 1 shows typical temporal hourly 

variation of radon concentration for one month, May as an example, picked up from the 

term  (I)  2002-02-01  to  2003-01-31  and  the  term  (II)  2003-02-01  to  2004-01-31, 

respectively.    In both terms, starting the ventilation indicates sudden decrease of radon 

concentration  since  the  concentration  is  much  lower  in  outdoor  air  than  in  indoor  air.   

In term (II), weekend halts of ventilation resulted in gently varying high concentration 

lapse seen once in a while in this figure. 

Statistical  analyses  were  made  using  S-PLUS  6.2J  9).    Paired  t-test  (two  sided, 

significant  level  1%)  checked  the  differences  between  arithmetic  means  of  three 

concentration  sets  before  and  after  the  change  of  ventilation  strategy.    Furthermore, 

Shapiro  and  Wilk's  normality  test  verified  the  statistical  distribution  of  data.    Lastly, 

one-way layout analysis with multiple comparison confirmed seasonal variations. 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Table  1  shows  basic  statistics  for  radon  concentration  (Rn),  equilibrium 

equivalent  radon  progeny  concentration  (ECRn)  and  equilibrium  equivalent  thoron 

progeny concentration (ECTn) before and after the change in the manner of ventilation.   

Arithmetic means of the concentrations of radon and its progeny rose slightly after the 

change  of  ventilation,  whereas  that  of  thoron  progeny  increased  drastically.    Each 

increase for the three concentration pairs all passed paired t-test as shown in the column 

of p-value in Table 1.    Those increases are attributed to the decrease of the introduction 

of outdoor air after the change of the ventilation strategy. 

A log-normal distribution is one of the well-known characteristics of radon and its 

progeny.    To  examine  the  statistical  distribution,  the  author  performed  the  normality 

test for the logarithm of each data set (zero-data were omitted).    As can be seen from 

the column of LNT in Table 1, log-normality decreased after the change of ventilation 

manner.    This reduction of log-normality is probably attributed to less introduction of 

 
− 3 − 

outdoor  air  after  the  ventilation  change,  since  outdoor  air  often  indicates  log-normal 
distribution 6, 7). 

Figure  2  shows  the  temporal  variation  of  monthly  averaged  concentration  for 

radon,  radon  progeny  and  thoron  progeny  separately.    Figure  2  again  indicates  slight 

increase  of  radon  and  its  progeny,  and  drastic  increase  of  thoron  progeny.    All  these 

increases are statistically significant as mentioned before. 

To  see  the  seasonal  variation,  data  were  separated  into  four  seasons,  i.e.,  spring 

(March  to  May),  summer  (June  to  August),  fall  (September  to  November)  and  winter 

(December to February).    Since the change of ventilation strategy occurred in February, 

sequential  data  were  not  available  for  the  winter  data,  therefore  the  winter  data  were 

picked up as February 2002, December 2002 and January 2003. 

Essentially the same seasonal dependency was observed for the term (I) and (II), 

namely the concentration of radon and radon progeny were high in fall, whereas that of 

thoron progeny was high in summer. 

Seasonal variation  of radon and its progeny may be affected by the variation  of 

outdoor air.    As a matter of fact, outdoor radon concentration is also high in fall, which 
is interpreted as follows.    The outdoor air is stable in autumn 7) and the vertical mixing 

of  air  is  small  in  this  season,  especially  in  the  morning  of  fine  weather,  resulting  the 

decreased  diffusion  rate  of  radon  into  atmosphere,  therefore  radon  concentration  near 

the  ground  remains  high.    In  spring  and  winter,  wind  with  high  speed  carries  away 

radon and its progeny, and in summer, high temperature of the earth increases vertical 

mixing  of  air  considerably.    The  author  does  not  know  any  information  concerning 

seasonal variation of thoron. 

Although  the  existence of  strong  ventilation  system, filters  cannot  prevent entry 

of  radon  into  the  room  because  radon  is  an  inert  gas.    Thus,  seasonal  variations  of 

indoor radon and its progeny resemble that of outdoor ones.    However, thoron will not 

come from outdoor air because of the short half life of thoron and the long route to the 

room. 

Why concentrations of thoron progeny are high in summer, unlike concentrations 

of  radon  and  its  progeny?    The  answer  is  probably  as  follows.    The  origin  of 

atmospheric thoron in the room is considered to be the materials of the room itself, i.e., 

the floor, wall, ceiling, etc.    The dissipation of thoron from these materials may depend 

on  temperature.    High  temperature  in  summer  may  probably  increase  the  dissipation 

rate of thoron.    Ventilation carries out thoron from the room to outside through exhaust 

pipes,  etc.    Thus,  the  change  of  the  manner  of  ventilation  system  strongly  affected 

 
− 4 − 

thoron and its progeny concentration. 

 

 

 

CONCLUSION 

The author investigated the effect of the ventilation strategy on the concentrations 

of  atmospheric  radon,  radon  progeny  and  thoron  progeny.    After  all,  less  ventilation 

increased radon, radon progeny and thoron progeny.    Interesting high concentration of 

thoron progeny in summer may probably be attributed to the short half life of thoron. 

Observation  of  the  change  of  the  radon-related  three  concentrations  before  and 

after the change of ventilation manner gave us a chance to speculate about the tendency 

and/or origin of radon-related radioactivity.

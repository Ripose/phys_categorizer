dominated  cosmology  and  facilitate  reconstruction  of  initial 
dark matter contributions to CMB  

A.  W. Beckwith  

ABSTRACT  

We  review  the  results  of  a  model  of  how  nucleation  of  a  new  universe  occurs, 

assuming  a  di  quark  identification  for  soliton-anti  soliton  constituent  parts  of  a  scalar 

field.  The  intial  potential  system  employed  is  semi  classical  in  nature,  becoming  non-

classical  at  the  end  of  chaotic  inflation  at  the  same  time  cosmological  expansion  is 

dominated  by  the  Einstein  cosmological  constant.  We  use  Scherrer's  derivation  of  a 

sound speed being zero during initial inflationary cosmology, and cange it afterwards as 

the slope of the scalar field moves away from a thin wall approximation. All this is to aid 

in a data reconstruction problem of how to account for the initial origins of CMB due to 

dark matter since effective field theories as presently constructed require a cut off value 

for applicability of their potential structure. This is often at the cost of, especially in early 

universe  theoretical  models,  of  clearly  defined  baryogenesis,  and  of  a  well  defined 

mechanism of phase transitions. The material below is now a proposal, in part accepted 

as  a  point  of  discussion  as  a  white  paper  (appropriately)  submitted  to  the  Dark  Energy 

Task Force, in its mission to advise (through its parent committees) the NSF, NASA and 

DOE.  This  was  for  helping  to  select  both ground-based and  space-based  techniques  for 

analyzing data as well as recommending the science requirements for a space-based dark 

energy mission.

I. 

INTRODUCTION  

As  of  June  2005,  an  effort  was  made  to  combine  reconstruction  of  data  gathering 

techniques  with  the  requirement  of  the  JDEM  dark  matter-dark  energy  search  for  the 

origins  of  dark  matter  in  the  early  universe1.  This  has,  among  other  things,  lead  to 

methodologies being presented which could shed light as to the initial formation of scalar 

potentials which could contribute to CMB background radiation. In doing so, it was noted 

that  initial  dimensions,  as  postulated  by  Quin,  Pen,  and  Silk2  presented  evidence  as  to 

how three extra dimensions play a role in explaining how at very short distances gravity 

would have a 

5−r

 spatial behavior dependence in force calculations... The new variant of 

force law was relevant for scales at or below 

nm1

 in length. We find that this new force 

law and the additional dimensions would play a role in early universe nucleation models. 

The  initial  additional  dimensions, n ,  were  specified  as  leading  to  a  force  for  small 

distance  scales  below  a  crucial  radius  of 

R   leading  to  force  with  a  spatial  variance  of 

−−2

n

r

  ,  which  we  believe  plays  a  crucial  role  in  early  universe  nucleation  models. 

Arguments they presented 2,3 so happened to fix this the value of 

n

 as 3, which is enough 

to specify for very small dimensional settings a highly repulsive initial starting point for 

cosmological  inflation,  especially  if  the  value  of 

R >>

Pl

,  with  the  initial  radius  of  a 

nucleating universe being of the order of magnitude of 

 at or before a Planck time 

Pl

Pt

  

The initial impetus for making this effort was due to the following conundrum. As is 

commonly  known  in  cosmology  circles,  one  would  expect  a  flat  Friedman  –  Walker 

universe after 60 e-foldings, but beforehand one could expect sharp deviations as to flat 

space  geometry.  The  moment  one  would  expect  to  have  deviations  from  the  flat  space 

geometry would closely coincide with Rocky Kolb’s model for when degrees of freedom 

2 

 
 
 
would decrease from over 100 degrees of freedom to roughly ten or less during an abrupt 

QCD phase transition4. As was mentioned by Joe Lykken , the CMB model should yield 

a distinct ‘signal’ which is lending toward a non flat cosmological metric space potential 

which can be seen to be initiating a phase transition at about the end of the 60 e-folding 

regime  of  cosmological  expansion.  My  own  model  is  useful  for  such  QCD  phase 

transitions; while Kenji Kadoka’s potential reconstruction scheme is not specific as to a 

UNIQUE  potential  structure.  It  would  be  enough  in  itself  to  try  to  combine  the  two 

techniques  as  to  go  before  the  thousand  year  mark  Kenji  mentioned  as  to  data  sets 

permitting potential reconstruction, and to find evidence as to CMB background as to the 

initial phases of CMB generation leading to the datum Kolb mentioned as to the decrease 

in cosmic microwave radiation to its present value as a result of a QCD phase transition 

in the expansion of the early universe.. 

My model shows that a semi-classical phase-state formed from initial di quark pairs 

in  a  region  of  the  order  of  magnitude  of  Planck’s  constant  for  length 

  changes  to  a 

Pl

physical  system  whose  evolution  is  dominated  by  the  Einstein  cosmological  constant. 

The  initial  phase  state,  which  I  approximate  by  a  thin  wall  approximation,  is  similar  to 

the semi-classical bounce state that Sidney Coleman

5 postulated; however, it changes in 

time  to  a  very  different  system  at  the  end  of  cosmological  inflation.  The  model 

advantages  are  first  that  we  provide  a  template  for  employing  baryonic  states  to  form 

dark matter as a driving force for the formation and expansion of cosmological states to 

the  present  conditions  of  our  present  universe.  I  also  give  initial  conditions  for  the 

formation of CMB, which are not readily explained by current models. In addition, this 

model  ties  in  with  being  able  to  use  the  Veneziano  model  of  strength  of  all 

 

3 

 
 
 
forces,6gravitational and gauge alike. Veneziano’s model is one of the simplest ways to 

use  Planck’s  length 

  for  an  initial  starting  point  for  cosmological  nucleation  and 

Pl

expansion  from  the  formation  of  di  quark  pairs  with  a  very  high  number  of  degrees  of 

freedom in a confined state.

Kenji Kadoka’s methodology permits the general reconstruction of potentials as up to 

about 1000 years after the big bang. The issue at stake though is if or not re constructive 

methodology using some of these same methods could be countenanced going up to the 

end  of  the  60  e-folding  period  commonly  viewed  as  the  demarcation  between  flat  and 

curved  space,  with  a  curved  space  milieu  being  the  regime  of  active  nucleation  of  our 

universe. This would entail, among other things, finding traces in CMB data of the initial 

signature  of  the  big  bang  itself  and  tying  it  into  a  QCD  style  phase  transition,  via  the 

potential system which will be discussed briefly in the next section. This methodology by 

Kadota  should  be  seen  as  a  successor  to  Copeland,  .Kolb  et  al  and  their  earlier  paper 

about  generalized  procedures  for  reconstruction  of  cosmologically  significant  potentials 

in cosmology9

III. BRIEF RE CAP OF QINS EXTRA DIMENSIONS FROM DARK 
MATTER ARTICLE 

As mentioned, Quinn’s article2 gives a new force law, with respect to distances at or 

below 

nm1

 in length. As presented in the article, this appears to be a verification of the 

existence of small but non infinitesimal extra dimensions. The key assumption which was 

used in their paper was a force law of the general form for distances

would lead to a quite necessary collapse of the thin wall approximation. This collapse of 

the  thin  wall  approximation  set  the  stage  for  an  Einstein  constant  dominated  regime  in 

inflation, if one adheres to a version of Scherrer’s K essence theory

the di quark pairs used as an initial starting point for soliton-anti soliton pairs(S-S’) in the 

beginning of quantum nucleation of our universe. 

IV. HOW TO ANALYZE PHYSICAL STATES IN THE 
PRECURSORS TO INFLATIONARY COSMOLOGY 

Let  us  first  consider  an  elementary  definition  of  what  constitutes  a  semi  classical 

state.  As  visualized  by  Buniy  and  Hsu,11  it  is  of  the  form a   which  has  the  following 

properties: 

i) Assume 

=aa

1

1

 

(Where 1 is an assumed identity operator, such that 1 a = a ) 

ii)  We  assume  that  a   is  a  state  whose  probability  distribution  is  peaked  about  a 

central value, in a particular basis, defined by an operator  Z  

7 

 
 
 

 

a) Our assumption above will naturally lead, for some n values 

n
aZa

(

≡

aZa

n

)  

Furthermore, this will lead to, if an operator  Z  obeys Eq. (4.1) that if there exists another 

operator, call it Y which does not obey Eq. (4.1), that usually we have non commutativity 

[
≠ZY

] 0

,

 

Buniy and Hsu6 speculate that we can, in certain cases, approximate a semi classical 

evolution equation of state for physical evolution of cosmological states with respect to 

classical  physics  operators.  This  well  may  be  possible  for  post  inflationary  cosmology; 

however, in the initial phases of quantum nucleation of a universe, it does not apply. 

To review our model of S-S’ pair nucleosynthesis for di quark pair states in an early 

universe, first is the issue of how the potential evolved. Namely:

Please see the conclusion for misgivings I have about this very simplified model in 

Eq. (4.7). Eq. (4.7) would likely be redone substantially in a future calculation with brane 

world  type  of  topological  defects.  Assuming  that  this  is  a  valid  initial  dimensional 

approximation, we did the following for the three potentials. 

a.  Assumed  that  the  scalar  wave  functional  term  was  decreasing  in  ‘height’  and 

increasing in ‘width’ as we moved from the first to the third potentials.φ also had 

a  definite  evolution  of  the  domain  wall  from  a  ‘near  perfect’  thin  wall 

approximation to one which had a considerable slope existing with respect to the 

wall.  

b.  We also observed that in doing this sort of model that there was a diminishing of 

applicability  of  Eq. (4.7)  for  large  N  values,  regardless  if  or  not  the  thin  wall 

approximation  was  weakened  as  we  went  from  the  first  to  the  third  potential 

system.  In  doing  to,  we  also  noted  that  even  in  Eq. (4.7)  for  the  first  potential, 

where  Eq. (4.7)  was  almost  identically  the  same  values  on  both  sides  of  the 

inequality, that Eq. (4.7) had diminishing applicability as a result for decreasing b 

values in Eq. (4.5),  which corresponded to when the thin wall approximation was 

least adhered to.  

We also observed that for the third potential, that there was never an overlap in value 

between  the  left  and  right  hand  sides  of  Eq. (4.7),  regardless  of  whether  the  thin  wall 

approximation was adhered to. In other words, the third potential was least linkable to a 

semi  classical  approximation  of  physical  behavior  linkable  to  a  physical  system,  while 

Eq. (4.7) worked best for a thin domain wall approximation to Eq. (4.5) in the driven sine 

Gordon  approximation  of  a  potential  system.  In  all  this,  we  assumed  that  the  small 

perturbing term added to the  (
1

)φ−
cos(
)

 part of Eq. (4.7) was a physical driving term to 

a very classical potential system  (
1

))
cos(
φ−

 which had a quantum origin consistent with 

the interpretation of a false vacuum nucleation of the sort initially formulated by Sidney 

10 

 
 
 
Coleman.5 Furthermore, as we observed an expanding ‘width’ in Eq. (4.5), the alpha term 

in Eq (4.6) shrank in its value, corresponding to a change in the position of constituent 

S-S’  components  in  the  scalar  field  given  in  this  model.  The  S-S’  terms  roughly 

corresponded to di quark pairs.  

c.  Chaotic  inflation  in  cosmology  is,  in  the  sense  a  quartic  potential  portrayed  by 
Guth,12 a general term for models of the very early Universe which involve a short 

period  of  extremely  rapid  (exponential)  expansion;  blowing  the  size  of  what  is 

now the observable Universe up from a region far smaller than a proton to about 

the  size  of  a  grapefruit  (or  even  bigger)  in  a  small  fraction  of  a  second.  This 

process smoothes out space-time to make the Universe flat, but is not in the model 

presented linkable in the chaotic inflationary region given by the third potential to 

any  semi  classical  arguments.  The  relative  good  fit  of  Eq.  (4.7)  for  the  first 

potential  is  in  itself  an  argument  that  the  thin  wall  approximation  breaks  down 

past the point of baryogenesis after the chaotic inflationary regime is initiated by 
the third potential as modeled by Guth.12

To summarize the numerical procedures in the set of simulations for Eq. (7), they are:

This assumes that the second term in the first potential, Eq (4.3a), is 1/100 of the first

As with the first potential, the relative divergence of the left and right hand sides of

first potential situation. 

And, then, finally we have the chaotic inflationary potential given by Guth,12 which

These  results  hold,  even  if  b  is  increased  in  value.  Namely,  the  overlap  vanishes 

Appendix  I  offers  even  more  striking  results.  Namely  that  if  one  uses  a  higher  6 

dimensional  ‘volume’  element  for  initial  nucleated  space,  that  the  agreement  of  Eq. (7) 

for a spatial six dimensional analysis as a starting point for the first potential will lead to 

an almost exact equality. Furthermore, if we use a normalization procedure as outlined in 

that appendix, and compare the ratios of both sides, that the relative slope of the scalar 

field will not be terribly important, in determining the relative contributions to both sides 

of  Eq. (7)  for  2nd  and  3rd  potentials.  Still  though  we  argue  that  for  especially  the  1st 

potential  that  the  higher  dimensionality  enhances  the  likelihood  of  a  semi  classical 

analysis being a good starting point, even though it appears to have only weak links to the 

chaotic inflationary 3rd potential as given in this analysis. 

The comparison of the evolution of these different cases for Eq. (4.7) argue that if we 

show that in between the physical states represented from the first to the third potentials 

there is a phase change which has measurable consequences for cosmological evolution. 

Furthermore,  we  can  employ  a  different  paradigm  as  to  how  topological  defects  (kinks 

and anti kinks) contribute to the onset of initial conditions at the beginning of inflationary 

cosmology.  Currently,  as  seen  by  Mark  Trodden14  and  Trodden  et  al,15  topological 

defects  are  similar  to  D  branes  of  string  theory;  while  this  S-S’  (soliton-antisoliton) 

 

13 

 
 
 
construction  permits  extensions  to  super-symmetric  theories,  it  obscures  direct  links  to 

inflationary cosmological potentials such as Guth’s12 harmonic potential.  

The zeroth level assumption underlying this is that there could be a C-P violation in 

the initial phases of states of matter. This in turn leads to Baryon matter state separation 

into Baryon-anti Baryon pairs (di quark pairs) which in turn would lead to the S-S’ pair 

formation  alluded  to  in  Guth.12  If  the  di  quark  pairs  form,  we  would  have  a  situation 

where an overall topological charge Q would tend to then vanish for our physical system. 

To  make  the  linkage  clearer,  we  can  present  the  di  quark  S-S’  pairs  as  an  initial 

starting point for times 

t ≤

Pt

, where 

Pt

 is Planck’s discretized smallest unit of time as a 

coarse graining of time stepping in cosmological evolution. Initially, let us look at work 

by Zhitnitsky

16 about formation of a soliton object via a so called di quark condensate.  

a)  A  C-P  violation  in  initial  states  would  lead  to  an  initial  Baryon  condensate  of 

matter separating into actual S-S’ di quark pairs: 

b)  for times less than or equal to Planck time 

 the potential system for analyzing 

Pt

the  nucleation  of  a  universe  is  a  driven  Sine  Gordon  system,

17  with  the  driving 

force in magnitude far less than the overall classical Sine Gordon potential.  

c)  for this potential system, topological charges for a S-S’ di quark pair stem prior to 

Planck  time 

  cancel  out,  leaving  a  potential  proportional  to 

2φ

  minus  a 

Pt

contribution  due  to  quantum  fluctuations  of  a  scalar  field  being  equal  in 

magnitude  to  a  classical  system,  with  the  remaining  scalar  potential  field 

contributing to cosmic inflation in the history of the early universe.  

The next assumption is that  a vacuum fluctuation of energy equivalent to 

Et
h=∆⋅∆

 

will lead to the nucleation of a new universe, provided that we are setting our initial time 

t P ∆≈
t

 as the smallest amount of time which can be ascertained  in a quantum universe.  

 

14 

 
 
 

Pt

If a phase transition occurs right after our nucleation of an initial state, it is due to the 

time of nucleation actually being less than (or equal to) Planck’s minimum time interval 

 , with the length specified by reconciling the fate of the false vacuum potential used in 

nucleation  with  a  Bogomol’nyi  inequality  specifying  the  vanishing  of  topological 

charge

18. We can use S-S’ di quark pairs to represent an initial scalar field, which, after 

time 

t P ∆≈
t

,  will  descend  into  the  typical  chaotic  inflationary  potential  used  for 

inflationary cosmology.  

V. INCLUDING IN NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS 
FOR FORMING A CONDENSATE STATE AT OR BEFORE 
PLANCK TIME 

  Pt

For  a  template  for  the  initial  expansion  of  a  scalar  field  leading  to  false  vacuum 

inflationary  dynamics  in  the  expansion  of  the  universe,  Zhitnitsky’s19  formulation  for 

how to form a condensate of a stable soliton style configuration of cold dark matter is a 

useful  starting  point  for  how  an  axion  field  can  initiate  forming  a  so  called  QCD  ball. 

Zhitnitsky19 uses quarks in a non-hadronic state of matter that, in the beginning, can be in 

di  quark  pairs.  A  di  quark  pair  would  permit  making  equivalence  arguments  to  what  is 

done with cooper pairs and a probabilistic representation as to find the relative ‘size’ of 

the cooper pair. We assume an analogous operation can be done with respect to di quark 

pairs. In doing so, calculations19 for quarks being are squeezed by a so called QCD phase 

transition  due  to  the  violent  collapse  of  an  axion  domain  wall.  The  axion  domain  wall 

would  be  the  squeezer  to  obtain  a  so  called  S-S’  configuration.  This  presupposes  a 

formation of a highly stable soliton type configuration in the onset due to the growth in 

baryon mass

This  is  due  to  a  large  baryon  (quark)  charge  B   which  Zhitnitsky19  finds  is  smaller 

than an equivalent mass of a collection of free separated nucleons with the same charge. 

This provides a criteria for absolute stability by writing a region of stability for the QCD 

balls dependent upon the inequality occurring for 

B >.

 (a critical charge value) 

CB

He19  furthermore  states  that  stability,  albeit  not  absolute  stability  is  still  guaranteed  for 

the formation of meta stable states occurring with  

If we make the assumptions that there is a balance between Fermi pressure 

fP

 and a 

pressure due to surface tension, with 

σ being an axion wall tension value19 so that  

This pre supposes that 

Ω

 is some sort of thermodynamic potential of a non interacting 

Fermi  gas,  so  that  one  can  then  get  a  mean  radius  for  a  QCD  ball  at  the  moment  of 

formation of the value, when assuming

If we wish to have this of the order of magnitude of a Planck length

supposes a minimum value of

(5.6) 

We need to keep in mind that Zhitnitsky19 set this parameterization up to account for 

a dark matter candidate. I am arguing that much of this same concept is useful for setting 

up  an  initial  condensate  of  di  quark  pairs  as,  separately  S-S’  in  the  initial  phases  of 

nucleation, with the further assumption that there is an analogy with the so called color 

super conducting phase (CS) which would permit di quark channels. The problem we are 

analyzing  not  only  is  equivalent  to  BCS  theory  electron  pairs  but  can  be  linked  to 

creating a region of nucleated space in the onset of inflation which has S-S’ pairs. The 

S-S’  pairs  would  have  a  distance  between  them  proportional  to  distance  mentioned 

earlier,

0R

, which would be greater than or equal to the minimum Planck’s distance value 

of

Pl

.  The  moment  one  would  expect  to  have  deviations  from  the  flat  space  geometry 

would  closely  coincide  with  Rocky  Kolb’s  model  for  when  degrees  of  freedom  would 

decrease from over 100 degrees of freedom to roughly ten or less during an abrupt QCD 

phase transition

4. The QCD phase transition would be about the time one went from the 

first to the second potential systems mentioned above. 

VI. HOW THIS TIES IN WITH REGARDS TO THE SCHERRER K 
ESSENCE MODEL RESULTS 

 We20 have investigated the role an initial false vacuum procedure with a driven sine 

Gordon potential plays in the nucleation of a scalar field in inflationary cosmology. Here, 

we  show  how  that  same  scalar  field  blends  naturally  into  the  chaotic  inflationary 

cosmology presented by Guth12 which has its origins in the evolution of nucleation of an 

electron-positron  pair  in  a  de  Sitter  cosmology.  The  final  results  of  this  model,

(6.1) 

Here, the negative pressure requirement involving both first and second derivatives of 

the potential w.r.t. scalar fields divided by the potential itself being very small quantities, 

where H is the expansion rate that is a requirement of realistic inflation models.12 This is 

due  to  having  the  potential  in  question

We  have  formed,  using  Scherrer’s  argument,10,20  a  template  for  evaluating  initial 

conditions  to  shed  light  on  whether  this  model  universe  is  radiation-dominated  in  the 

beginning or is more in sync with having its dynamics determined by assuming a straight 

cosmological  constant.  Our  surprising  answer  is  that  we  do  not  have  conditions  for  

formation  of  a  cosmological  constant-dominated  era  when  close  to  a  thin  wall 

approximation of a scalar field of a nucleating universe, but that this is primarily due to 

an  extremely  sharp  change  in  slope  of  the  would-be  potential  field  φ.  The  sharpness  of 

this  slope,  leading  to  a  near  delta  function  behavior  for  kinematics  at  the  thin  wall 

approximation  for  the  initial  conditions  of  an  expanding  universe  would  lead,  at  a  later 

time,  to  conditions  appropriate  for  necessary  and  sufficient  cosmological  dynamics 

largely  controlled  by  a  cosmological  constant  when  the  scalar  field  itself  ceases  to  be 

affected by the thin wall approximation but is a general slowly declining slope.

The  potential  reconstruction  I  believe  could  be  greatly  aided  by  some  of  the  initial 

effective contributions of extra dimensionality and of side effects of the baryogenesis16,20 

mentioned  in  the  formation  of  our  early  universe  potential  nucleation  model  The  idea 

would  be  to  find  ways  to  obtain  data  sets  via  techniques  most  congruent  to  reliable 

potential reconstruction of the early inflationary cosmos. Before the 1000 or so year limit 

specified by Kenji Kadota in discussions I had with him at Pheno 2005 7.  

 If  finding  acceptable  match  up  of  data  sets  with  how  to  reconstruct  a  complicated 

potential  beyond  the  one  given  by  Eq (8.1)  above  was  completed  in  general.  Then  one 

would face a discussion with manufacturers of the satellite used for dark matter searching 

as to tailor made electronics which would be acceptable for obtaining sufficient data sets.  

I  am  assuming  that  this  investigation  would  be  one  out  of  many  being  used  in  the 

upcoming satellite mission.

which  is  still  huge  for  an  initial  starting  point,  whereas  we  manage  to  in  our  S-S’ 

‘distance model’ to imply a far smaller but still non zero radii for the initial ‘universe’ in 

our model.  

We  find  that  the  above  formulation  in  Eq. (9.1)  is  most  easily  accompanied  by  the 

given  S-S’  di  quark  pair  basis  for  the  scalar  field  used  in  this  paper,  and  that  it  also  is 

consistent with the initial scalar cosmological state evolving toward the dynamics of the 

cosmological constant via the k essence argument built up near the end of this document. 

Furthermore, we also argue that the semi classical analysis of the initial potential system 

as  given  by  Eq. (4.7)  and  its  subsequent  collapse  is  de  facto  evidence  for  a  phase 

transition to conditions allowing for CMB to be created at the beginning of inflationary 

cosmology.  

 

 

26 

 
 
 

 

We are fortunate as shown in Appendix I that for determining the relative good fit of 

Eq. (4.7) that the relative domain walls slope of the initial phase given by Eq. (4.5) was 

not  terribly  significant,  for  the  first  potential  system,  which  dove  tails  with  Eq. (4.1) 

merely pushing out the domain walls, as a primary effect, for a driven sine Gordon type 

modeling of false vacuum nucleation. As ,mentioned earlier, this was actually heightened 

by  the  extra  dimensionality  as  alluded  to  by  the  power  law  relationship  in  Eq. (4.1) 

making an almost perfect equality between the left and right hand sides of Eq. (4.7). That 

the  different  sides  of  Eq. (4.7)  in  Appendix  I  had  varying  values,  showing  different 

degrees  of  break  down  of  this  relationship  for  the  2nd    transitional  potential,  due  to 

differences  in  dimensionality  and  slope  of  the  scalar  field  as  given  by  Eq. (4.5)  is 

probably due to this representing the abrupt loss of numbers of degrees of freedom Rocky 

Kolb has mentioned as part of a phase transition. Needless to say though, as we evolve 

toward the Einstein cosmological constant era and chaotic inflation, as given by the 3rd 

potential, we should keep in mind very real limits as to the comparative sharpness of the 

slope of the scalar field as given by Eq. (4.5) 

K essence analysis argues against making b in Eq. (4.5) too large, i.e., if we have a 

‘perfect’ thin wall approximation to our S-S’ di quark pairs, we will have the unphysical 

speed  of  sound  results  plus  other  consequences  detailed  in  the  k  essence  section  of  the 

document which we do not want. On the other hand, the semi classical analysis brought 

up  in  the  section  starting  with  Eq. (4.7)  shows  us  that  a  close  to  the  thin  wall 

approximation for S-S’ di quark pairs gives an optimal fit for consistency in the potential 

with the wave functions exhibiting a thin wall approximation ‘character’. It is useful to 

note that our kinetic model can be compared with the very interesting Chimentos24purely 

27 

 
 
 
kinetic  k  –essence  model,  with  density  fluctuation  behavior  at  the  initial  start  of  a 

nucleation  process.  The  model  indicate  our  density  function  reach 

=ρ  constant  after 

passing  through  the  tunneling  barrier    as  mentioned  in  our  nucleation  of    a  S-S’  pair 

ensemble.  This  is  when  the  Einstein  constant  becomes  dominant  and  that  the  semi 

classical  approximation  in  Eq.  (4.7)  for  a  domain  wall  at  the  time  the  comparative  thin 

wall approximation S-S’ pair ceases to be relevant.  

 Our initial attempt here very likely should be re visited, especially if the sort of brane 

world objects referred to by Trodden et al14,15 are used in a future calculation for initial 

nucleation states. However, this should all be done to re calibrate how to fill in the CMB 

contribution toward reconstruction of a suitable class of potentials which could shed light 

not only on the origins of baryogenesis, in early universe models, but also in determining 

how  dark  matter-dark  energy  could  contribute  to  the  formation  of  initial  inflationary 

cosmology  parameters.  The  hope  is  that  if  suitable  data  reconstruction  methodology  is 

obtained  and  refined,  that  one  could  as  an  example  determine  how  the  initial  physical 

fundamental constants could be set as they are, as well understand how dark matter-dark 

energy contribute to the initial origins of CMB itself

Furthermore, we should note that these nucleation configurations fit in well with the 

following model of false vacuum nucleation.

This is in line with the first specified potential as given in Eq. (4.4a) which we claim 

eventually  becomes  in  sync  with  Eq. (4.4c).  Further  progress  in  investigating  this 

phenomenology should take into account the datum so mentioned in the text, about the 

original  multiple  dimensions  in  the  initial  phases  of  a  nucleating  universe,  which 

subsequently  are  reduced  as  the  scalar  potential  evolves  toward  the  chaotic  potential

thicker  wall  approximation  with  increasing  L  between  S-S’  instanton  components.  The 

‘height’ drops and the ‘width’ L increases correspond to a de evolution of the thin wall 

approximation.  This  is  in  tandem  with  a  collapse  of  an  initial  nucleating  ‘potential’ 

system to the standard chaotic scalar 

 potential system of Guth. As the ‘hill’ flattens,

cosmological constant behavior.

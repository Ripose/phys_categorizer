Abstract 
 

It is shown that the grain mass fluctuation, which is due to the grain sputtering by the attracted ions, may 
be at the root of a new instability in infinite, unmagnetized and homogeneous dusty plasmas. The growth 
rate is determined in the framework of two plasma models, viz., a cold and electron depleted plasma, and a 
plasma where electrons and ions are taken Boltzmannian. This instability may affect the Jeans as well as 
the agglomeration instabilities. 
 

Dusty plasmas are known to be encountered in numerous astrophysical situations such as 
protoplanetary nebulae, interstellar media, molecular clouds1..etc. As a matter of fact, the 

dust  component  is  essential  for  many  processes,  e.g.,  star  formation  and  planetary 

structures.  Indeed,  when  the  grain  mass  is  important,  a  competition  between  the 

electromagnetic  as  well  as  the  gravitational  forces  arises  that  leads  to  the  distinction  of 
different regimes2, viz., when the gravitational force prevails, large structures are formed 

due  to  molecular  clouds  collapse,  whereas  if  the  competing  forces  are  balancing  one 

another,  a  critical  limit  is  set  on  the  Jeans  instability  and  structures  like  spokes  in 

Saturn’s rings may be explained. This balance is affected by many factors such as, dust 
size  distribution,  magnetic  field,  collisions  of  dust  with  ions/neutrals3  and  dust  grain 

charge fluctuations. 

In  this  note  we  address  a  new  factor  that  is  the  erosion  of  the  grain  by  the  ions 
falling  onto  the  surface4.  We  confine  ourselves  however,  to  the  sputtering  mechanism 

where the ions strike the grain surface and transfer momentum to the grain atoms that are 

ejected  consequently.  The  grain  mass  becomes  a  dynamical  variable  and  dust  mass 

fluctuations are introduced in the stability analysis. 

 

Let us consider an electron depleted dusty plasma consisting of ions and charged 

grains, the evolution of which is governed by the following equations (c.f. Ref.[5]),

In our study, we consider a grain eroded by the ions striking it. The loss in the mass is 

modelled by a sink term in the continuity equation. The corresponding loss in momentum

It appears that the modes

1 and

1  are zero frequency damped modes while

2  and

2 are purely growing modes. To implement our model we consider grains of graphite 

immersed in a hydrogen plasma. The choice of the graphite material is realistic for most 
grains in astrophysical media are grown from silicate and graphite.2

A  more  realistic  approach  may  be  developed,  where  ions  and  electrons  that  are  taken 

Boltzmannian,  do  not  experience  significantly  the  gravitational  effect.  Dropping  Eq.(9) 

demands an additional constraint; the conservation of the grains number is then retained.

surface is taken into account. The grain mass is then a dynamical variable. A cold plasma 

approximation  is  privileged  to  highlight  the  sputtering  effect.  The  growth  rate  of  the 

instability is determined. Two new modes have been derived, viz. a damped mode at zero 

frequency  and  a  purely  growing  mode.  In  an  improved  model,  the  electrons  that  have 

been dropped earlier are considered Boltzmannian as well as the ions. A cubic dispersion 

relation  is  then  derived  and  analytically  solved.  It  is  found  that  two  modes,  viz.,  a 

damped mode at zero frequency and a growing mode at a finite frequency are supported 

by  the  plasma.  This  instability  arising    due  to  grain  mass  fluctuations,  may  affect the 

balance  between  the  electrostatic  repulsion  and  the  gravitational  attraction.  It  is 

worthwhile noticing that grain charge fluctuations for a constant mass have been already 

shown  to  offset  this  balance  as  well.  We  believe  that  the  sputtering  ins tability affects 

also, the agglomeration instability as defined in Ref.[6], because it develops on a much 

longer timescale (

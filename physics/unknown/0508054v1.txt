Abstract 

Recently,  the  Turkic  Accelerator  Complex  (TAC)  is 
proposed  as  a  regional  facility  for  accelerator  based 
fundamental  and  applied  research.  The  complex  will 
include  linac  on  ring  type  electron-positron  collider  as  a 
phi, charm and tau factory, linac based free electron laser 
(FEL),  ring  based  third  generation  synchrotron  radiation 
(SR)  source  and  a 
few  GeV  proton  accelerator. 
Preliminary  estimations  show  that  integral  luminosity  of 
hundred inverse femto-barns per year can be achieved for 
factory  options.  The  FEL  facility  is  planned  to  obtain 
laser beam between IR and soft X-ray region. In addition, 
SR  facility  will  produce  photon  beams  in  UV  and  X-ray 
region.  The  proton  accelerator  will  give  opportunity  to 
produce  muon  and  neutron  beams  for  applied  research. 
The current status of the conceptual study of the complex 
is presented.    

INTRODUCTION 
Particle  accelerators  technology  is  one  of  the  generic 
technologies  which  is  locomotive  of  the  development  in 
almost  all  fields  of  science  and  technology.  Because  of 
this, accelerator technology should become widespread all 
over  the  world.  Existing  situation  shows  that  a  large 
portion  of  the  world,  namely  the  South  and  Mid-East,  is 
poor  on  the  accelerator  technology.    UNESCO  has 
recognized  this  deficit  and  started  SESAME  project  in 
Mid-East,  namely  Jordan  (see  [1]  and  refs.  therein). 
Turkic  Accelerator  Complex  (TAC)  project  is  more 
comprehensive  and  ambitious  project,  from  the  point  of 
light  sources,  particle  physics 
view  of 
experiments and proton and secondary beam applications.

Approximately 10 years ago, linac-ring type charm-tau 
factory  with  synchrotron  light  source  was  proposed  as  a 
regional  project  for  elementary  particle  physics  [2]. 
Starting from 1997, a small group from Ankara and Gazi 
Universities  begins  a  feasibility  study  for  the  possible 
accelerator complex in Turkey with the support of Turkish 
State Planning Organization (DPT) [3]. The results of the 
study  is  published  in  [4]  and  presented  at  EPACs  [5-6]. 
Starting  from  2002,  the  conceptual  design  study  of  the 
TAC  project  has  started  with  a  relatively  enlarged  group 
(again with the DPT support). For the future plans, see the 
section on time schedule. 

At this stage, TAC project includes: 

•  Linac-ring type charm factory 
•  Synchrotron light source based on positron ring  
•  Free electron laser based on electron linac 
•  GeV scale proton accelerator 
•  TAC-Test Facility. 

The schematic  view of the  factory and light  sources part 
of the Turkic Accelerator Complex is given in Fig. 1.

is plotted in Figure 2. It is seen that center of mass energy 
spread  is  well  below  (cid:2)(cid:3)(3S)  (cid:4)  24  MeV.  Expected  number 
of  (cid:3)(3S)  is  about  109  per  working  year  (107  s).  Let  us 
remind  that  D+D-  and  D0D0  decay  modes  are  dominant 
channels for (cid:3)(3S) decays.

SYNCHROTRON LIGHT SOURCE 
Ref. [2] had considered additional positron storage ring 
dedicated to production of synchrotron radiation. Because 
of  beam-beam  tune  shift  restriction,  the  emittance  of 
colliding  beams  in  standard  (ring-ring)  type  colliders 
inevitably  should  be  chosen  to  be  relatively  large  to 
obtain high luminosity:

where  subscript  e  (p)  corresponds  to  electron  (positron).  
This  restricts  the  performance  of  synchrotron  radiation 
obtained  from  insertion  devices  placed  in  standard  type 
colliders.  

                             (1) 

Fortunately,  this  is  not  the  case  for  linac-ring  type 
machines.  In  this  case,  emittance  of  the  positron  beam 
does not essentially affect luminosity performance of the 
co llider:

Therefore,  the  emittance  of  the  positron  beam  can  be 
chosen small enough to behave as a third generation light 
source in principle. Normalized emittance of the positron 
beam given in Table 1 corresponds to transverse emitance 
of 3 nm•rad, which is well below 20 nm•rad (upper limit 
for third generation SR sources). 

Main  parameters  of  TAC  SR  Facility  were  reported  at 
EPAC 2000 [5]. Since then, construction of SESAME [1, 
11]  has  begun  in  Jordan  and  CANDLE  [12]  project  has 
been developed in Armenia. For this reason, final decision 
on the number of insertion devices and beam lines of TAC 
SR  Facility  and  their  specifications  will  be  made 
depending  on  realization  of  SESAME  and  CANDLE 
projects as well as on user potential in our region.  

Several  samples  of  optical  beam  lines  design  and 

related studies on TAC SR facility can be found in [13].  

FREE ELECTRON LASER 
Main  linac  of  the  TAC  charm  factory  can  be  operated 
separately  to  obtain  FEL  as  seen  from  Figure  1.  FEL 
operation  is  foreseen  during  the  maintenance  of  the 
collider. With 1 GeV electron beam wave length of SASE 
FEL photons is expected to be a few nm. Detailed studies 
for  different  electron  beam  energies  were  presented  at 
national conferences [13].  

 

PROTON ACCELERATOR 
TAC  proton  accelerator  proposal  consists  of  100(cid:247)300 
MeV  energy  linear  pre-accelerator  and  1(cid:247)5  GeV  main 
ring. The average beam current values for these machines 
would  be  ~30  mA  and  ~0.3  mA,  respectively.  Proton 
beams  from  two  different  points  of  the  synchrotron  will 
be forwarded to neutron and muon regions, where a wide 
spectrum of applied research is planned. In muon region, 
together  with  fundamental  investigations  such  as  test  of 
QED  and  muonium-antimuonium  oscillations,  a  lot  of 
applied investigations such as High-Tc superconductivity, 
phase  transitions,  impurities  in  semiconductors  et  cetera 
will  be  performed  using  the  powerful  Muon  Spin 
region

investigations  in  different  fields  of  applied  physics, 
engineering,  molecular  biology  and  fundamental  physics 
are planned.

TAC TEST FACILITY 
Before building charm factory to obtain training of the 
young  accelerator  physicists  and  to  get  experience  on 
accelerator technology on smaller scale, we plan to build 
infrared  free  electron  laser  (IR  FEL)  on  20(cid:247)50  MeV  e-
linac  until  2009.  IR  FEL  thought  to  work  in  oscillator 
mode.  With  undulator  strength  parameter  K=1  and 
vertical  distance  between  magnet  poles  g=3  cm,  one  can 
obtain wavelength values of 15 mm (IR FEL1) and 2 mm 
(IR  FEL2)  for  10  MeV  and  50  MeV  e-linac  choices, 
respectively.  Three  experimental  stations  are  planed  to 
make  research  on  biomedical  subjects,  semiconductor 
physics and photo chemical reactions.

was  assessed  by  comparing  simulated  99mTc  point  spread  functions,  energy 
spectra, sensitivities, scatter fractions and image of a capillary phantom with 
the  corresponding experimental measurements. Results showed an excellent

fractions  in  a  [98-182  keV]  energy  window  differed  by  less  than  2%  for

1. Introduction 

Monte Carlo simulations are extensively used nowadays to address various issues related to 
scintigraphic imaging, for instance to design and optimize imaging systems and collimator 
or to develop and assess correction methods and tomographic reconstruction algorithms for 
improved  image  quantitation  (Zaidi  1999).  Two  categories  of  Monte  Carlo  codes  are 
currently  available  in  nuclear  imaging  (Zaidi  1999,  Buvat  and  Castiglioni  2002):  general 
purpose  codes  (EGS4,  GEANT,  MCNP,  ITS),  developed  for  high-energy  physics  or 
dosimetry, and dedicated codes (e.g., SIMIND, SimSET, SimSPECT, PETSIM), especially 
designed  for  Single  Photon  Emission  Computed  Tomography  (SPECT)  and/or  Positron 
Emission Tomography (PET). Although dedicated codes are usually convenient to use and 
well suited to the simulations of commonly used SPECT and PET configurations, most of 
them  do  not  accurately  simulate  all  the  system  components,  such as the collimator or the 
components located behind the crystal, while these components can substantially affect the 
final  image  characteristics  (De  Vries  et  al  1990,  Yanch  and  Dobrzeniecki  1993).  Also, 
dedicated  codes  have  limited  flexibility  for  simulating  non-conventional  imaging  device. 
For  such  applications,  general  purpose  codes  might  be  preferable.  GATE  (GEANT4 
Application for Tomographic Emission) (Santin et al 2003) is a generic simulation platform 
based  on  a  general  purpose  code  GEANT4  and  designed  to  answer  the  specific  needs  of 
PET/SPECT  applications.  Several  research  institutes  dealing  with  SPECT  and  PET  are 
involved in the development and validation of GATE within the OpenGATE Collaboration 
(http://www-lphe.epfl.ch/~PET/research/gate).  In  addition  to  the  many  potentialities 
provided  by  GEANT4,  GATE  includes  specific  modules  necessary  to  perform  realistic 
SPECT  and  PET  simulations,  including  modules  managing  time  and  time-dependent 
processes  (detector  and  source  movements,  radioactive  decay,  dynamic  acquisitions), 
complex and voxel-based source distributions and easy description of scanner geometry.  

This  paper  presents  the  use  and  validation  of  GATE  for  simulating  acquisitions 
performed on a scintillation camera prototype dedicated to small animal imaging built and 
tested at the Institute of Accelerating Systems and Applications of Athens (IASA). Small 
field-of-view (FOV) scintillation cameras based on position-sensitive photomultiplier tubes 
(PSPMTs) have been developed during the past decade and have already demonstrated their 
suitability for small-organ imaging (Zaidi 1996), radiopharmaceutical testing (Loudos et al 
2003) or scintimammography (Maublant et al 1996, Scopinaro et al 1999, Williams et al 
2000). Characteristics and performances of such devices have been well described (Vittori 
et  al  1998,  Pani  et  al  1997):  a  spatial  resolution  of  about  2  mm  can  be  achieved  at  the 
expense  of  the  energy  resolution,  which  is  about  30%.  Few  papers  report  complete 
simulations of small field-of-view scintillation cameras based on a crystal array (Vittori et 
al  2000,  Garibaldi  et  al  2001).  Such  simulations  should  help  optimize  the  geometry  and 
components of the imaging device, test and assess imaging and processing strategies.

Section  2  briefly  describes  the  main  features  of  the  GATE  simulation  platform,  the 
experimental  scintillation  camera  prototype,  as  well  as  the  scintillation  camera  model 
developed  with  GATE  and  the  validation  procedures  used  to  assess  the  relevance  of  the 
simulated  data.  In  section  3,  experimental  energy  spectra,  point  spread  functions  (PSF), 
sensitivity,  scatter  fractions  and  the  image  of  a  capillary  phantom  are  compared  with 
simulation  results  for  validation.  A  discussion  of  the  results  and  of  GATE  features 
concludes the manuscript. 

2. Material and methods 

2.1. GATE simulation platform 

The  GATE  simulation  platform  is  based  on  the  GEANT4  toolkit  (Santin  et  al  2003). 
GEANT is a simulation code that has been developed at CERN for more than 2 decades for 
the description of interactions between particles and matter. The first version of the code, 
GEANT3, was written in Fortran and has been extensively used around the world in high-
energy  physics  and  for  medical  applications  (e.g.,  Tsang  et  al  1995,  Rogers  and 
Gumplinger  1999,  Berthot  et  al  2000,  Porras  et  al  2002).  A  new  version  of  the  code, 
GEANT4 (RD 44 Collaboration 1998) is developed since 1994 and is written in the C++ 
object-oriented  language.  In  this  new  version,  the  modeling  of  electromagnetic  physical 
processes has been extended to reliably cover electromagnetic interactions from 250 eV to 
100 GeV (Apostolakis et al 1999). This modeling makes use of recently updated libraries 
developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (EADL, EEDL and EPDL97).  

As  the  global  architecture  of  GATE  has  been  described  in  details  (Santin  et  al  2003, 
Strul et al 2003), we only underline here the main features of GATE. On top of GEANT4, 
GATE  includes  specific  modules  that have been developed to meet specific requirements 
encountered  in  SPECT  and  PET  and  to  facilitate  the  use  of  the  code.  A  user-friendly 
mechanism based on scripts is used to easily define all the simulation parameters, including 
complex  detector,  or  phantom  and  source  distribution  geometry  modeling.  GATE  can 
model  time-dependent  processes,  through  the  use  of  a  virtual  clock  (Santin  et  al  2003), 
which  allows  the  management  of  scanner  or  patient  movements  and  tracer  kinetics  for 
instance.  

In  this  work,  GATE  was  used  to  simulate  the  IASA  scintillation  camera  (see  section 

2.2). 

2.2. The IASA scintillation camera 

2.2.1. Description of the prototype.  
IASA  scintillation  camera  prototype 
The 
consists of a 3 mm thick scintillating CsI(Tl) array coupled to a PSPMT Hamamatsu R2486 
(Malatesta et al 1998). The crystal array is 4.6 cm in diameter and is made of square pixels, 
covering the whole circular section of the crystal. Each pixel is separated from the others by 
a  250  µm-thick  diffusive  white  layer  (epoxy).  The  maximum  number  of  pixels  along  the 
diameter of the crystal array is 41 and the arrangement of the pixels is shown in figure 1. A 
detailed  description  of  the  CsI(Tl)  optical  and  mechanical  characteristics  can  be  found 
elsewhere (Vittori et al 1998). 

The  PSPMT  is  equipped  with  two  resistive  chains  connecting  8  +  8  crossed  anode 
wires.  The  readout  of  the  16  anode  signals  enables  calculation  of  the  centre  of  gravity 
(COG) of the electron cloud and the subsequent determination of the exact position of the 
incident photon in the (X,Y) plane. To avoid edge effects, anode wires that carry less than 5 
% of the total anode signal are disregarded in the COG calculation.

Figure  1.  (a)  Picture  of  the  IASA  scintillation  camera  simulated  with  GATE:  the  different 
components of the detector head are represented (collimator, white epoxy envelope surrounding 
the  crystal,  PSPMT  and  shielding);  (b)  the  hexagonal  hole  collimator  geometry;  (c)  the  CsI(Tl) 
crystal array geometry. 

 

 
The prototype is equipped with a removable low energy high resolution collimator (2.75 
cm  height,  0.4625  mm  septal  thickness)  with  a  1.12  mm  flat-to-flat  distance  of  the 
hexagonal parallel holes. The whole detection head is surrounded with a 5 mm thick lead 

shielding. 

 

Figure  1 shows a scheme of the experimental setup obtained by simulation, as well as 
the details of the collimator and CsI(Tl) crystal array. More details about this prototype can 
be found in (Loudos et al 2003). 

2.2.2. Monte Carlo model of the IASA camera. 
To  simulate the IASA camera, the 
collimator, the pixelated crystal (diffusive white layer envelope and crystal array) and the 
lead shielding were modelled. As the pixelated crystal is 3 mm thick, about 30% of the 140 
keV incident photons leave the crystal without interacting. Backscatter on the PSPMT glass 
entrance  window  is  taken  into  account  by  modelling  the  PSPMT  by  a  single  Plexiglas 
layer,  8  cm  thick  and  7.6  cm  in  diameter  (De  Vries  et  al  1990).  A  picture  of  the  IASA 
scintillation camera simulated with GATE (based on GEANT4 version 4.4.0 for this study) 
is shown in figure 1. 

In all simulations, each gamma ray was tracked through the object and detector until its 
energy fell below the energy cut or the gamma ray escaped from the system, defined by the

user as a large volume including the whole detection device (collimator, crystal array and 
PSPMT) and the imaged object (source and/or phantom). The energy cut was set to 10 keV, 
which  is  accurate  enough  as  the  experimental  device  provided  the  energy  spectrum  only 
down to 40 keV. X-rays resulting from fluorescence and Auger processes were tracked to 
ensure  accurate  modelling  of  interactions  within  the  collimator  of  the  camera,  whereas 
secondary electrons were not tracked to speed up the simulation. 

The  physical  processes  involving  gamma  interactions  (photoelectric  effect,  Compton 
scattering  and  Rayleigh  scattering)  were  modelled  using  the  electromagnetic  low-energy 
package  of  GEANT4.  If  energy  was  deposited  in  the  crystal  at  more  than  one  site,  the 
centroid of all interaction points weighted by the ratio of the deposited energy to the total 
energy  deposited  in  the  crystal  was  calculated  to  deduce  the  location  of  the  event.  All 
deposited energies were summed to associate a single energy value to the detected event. 
Spatial  coordinates  of  the  centroid  and  associated  energy  were  stored.  Optical  photon 
tracking was not modelled to save computation time.

As already reported in (Vittori et al 1998) and (Malatesta et al 1998), the pixels of the 
crystal array may present large light yield differences, which worsens the energy resolution 
of the system. To accurately reproduce the measured energy resolution, this effect had to be 
taken  into  account  in  the  simulations.  For  doing  so,  the  energy  response  of  the  pixelated 
crystal was experimentally measured by irradiating the detection area of CsI(Tl) with a 7.4 
x  108  Bq  liquid  source  of    99mTc  (140  keV)  contained  in  a  capillary  of  1.3  mm  external 
diameter  and  4  mm  length  and  located  at  a few millimetres from the crystal surface. The 
detection area of the crystal was subdivided into a matrix of 41 x 41 pixels and the energy 
spectra of the events detected within each pixel were stored. The Full Energy Peak (FEP), 
defined as the channel in which the maximum value of the photopeak was recorded, as well 
as  the  full  width  at  half  maximum  (FWHM)  of  the  local  photopeak,  were  computed  for 
each pixel.

Figure 2 represents the 41 x 41 map of FEP values: the FEP channel varied from 80 to 

170 keV from one pixel to another.  

This map was used to model the light yield differences in the simulation: depending on 
the  interaction  point  of  the  photon  in  the  crystal  array,  the  pixel  where  the  interaction 
occurred  was  determined  and  the  associated  energy  deposit  was  shifted  to  the  value 
predicted by the FEP map for this pixel. 

Using GEANT4, the simulation of the complete detection process is possible including 
the  modelling  of  the  scintillation  process  and  of  the  PSPMT.  However,  using  the  Monte 
Carlo approach to model these effects is very time consuming. We therefore used analytical 
convolution models to account for the intrinsic energy and spatial responses of the PSPMT 
and  subsequent  electronics,  using  a  Gaussian  energy  response  function  and  a  Gaussian 
point spread function. As the FWHM of the photopeak results both from the broadening of 
the photopeak introduced by the large light yield differences between adjacent pixels in the 
crystal and from the energy blurring caused by statistical fluctuations occurring within the 
crystal,  the  PSPMT  and  electronics,  the  energy  response  function  was  modelled  in  two 
steps: (1) first, the value of deposited energy was shifted using the FEP map as described 
above, (2) the resulting energy was blurred using a Gaussian function whose FHWM was 
given by the mean of the FWHM values (20.5% at 140 keV) calculated over all pixels of 
the  crystal  array.  The  energy  resolution  of  this  Gaussian  energy  response  function  was 
considered to be energy dependent following the relation (Knoll 1989):  

FWHM(E)

 and b  were estimated by considering the 20.5% energy resolution measured at 140 keV

and the energy resolution measured at 70 keV with 201Tl, yielding a

An  intrinsic  spatial  resolution  of  FWHMintrinsic  =  1.4  mm  was  previously  measured  in 
planar imaging (Loudos et al 2003) at IASA over the whole FOV and the spatial resolution 
FWHMcrystal of the CsI(Tl) crystal array was determined to be 0.6 mm (Vittori et al 1998). 
The  spatial  resolution  corresponding  to  the  PSPMT  and  associated  electronics  was  thus 

assumed to be 1.26 mm (

). This value was higher than the 

spatial resolution given by the manufacturer (0.5 mm) but accounts for spatial distortions 
introduced by the anode wires on the edges.

2.3. Validation of GATE for the IASA camera 

2.3.1. Spatial resolution.  The spatial resolution of the IASA camera was characterized by 
the  point  spread  functions  in  air  at  2,  5  and  10  cm  from  the  collimator.  These  were 
experimentally  measured  with  a  99mTc  point  source  consisting  of  a  1.3  mm  diameter 
capillary  of  2  mm  length  (activity  of  4.92  x  105  Bq).  A  first  set  of  measurements  was 
performed with the source at the centre of the FOV, and a second set was performed with 
the  source  1  cm  off-centred.  Images  corresponding  to  the  40-180  keV  energy  windows 
were obtained. A 10 mm thick profile through the point source was drawn for each of the 
six  images  (two  source  locations  and  three  source-collimator  distances)  and  the  FWHM 
values were calculated. 

The same six configurations were simulated using GATE. Monoenergetic gamma rays 

(140 keV) were emitted in the angle of acceptance of the scintillation camera in order to 
decrease computation time. The initial activity of the source was set to 4.92 x 105 Bq and 
about 140 million photon histories were generated (CPU time of about 8 h on a biprocessor 
Pentium III 1GHz computer). Events were collected between 40 and 180 keV and 
associated images were calculated. Profiles through these images yielded the FWHM to be 
compared with the experimental values. 

Point  spread  functions  were  also  measured  for  the  99mTc  point  source  in  water.  The 
source contained an initial activity of 3.54 x 105 Bq in a 1.3 mm diameter capillary of 3 mm 
length  and  was  located  at  the  centre  of  the  FOV,  at  12  cm  from  the  collimator,  under  a 
cylindrical  phantom  of  8  cm  diameter  and  11  cm  length  filled  with  4  or  10  cm  of  water. 
Images corresponding to the 40-180 keV energy windows were obtained and 10 mm thick 
profiles  centred  on  the  line  source  were  drawn.  The  same  configurations  were  simulated 
with  GATE:  the  source  activity  considered  in  the  simulations  was  the  same  as  the 
experimental value and about 415 million photon histories were generated in 4p
 sr (CPU 
time of about 24 h). 

2.3.2. Sensitivity.  
The  system  sensitivity,  defined  as  counts  per  second  per  kBq, 
was  experimentally  measured  and  calculated  using  GATE  for  a  99mTc  point  source  in  air 
contained in a 1.3 mm diameter capillary of 3 mm length (initial activity of 4.47 x 105 Bq), 
located at the centre of the FOV and at 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm from the collimator. About 
280 million photon histories were generated in 4p
 sr with GATE (CPU time of about 10 h). 
The radioactive decay was taken into account in the simulation. 

 

2.3.3. Scatter fraction. 
The  scatter  fraction  was  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  number  of 
events in the image which come from photons scattered at least once in the phantom or in 
the  collimator  to  the  number  of  events  coming from primary photons not scattered in the 
phantom.  
Scatter fractions were evaluated experimentally for a thickness of water of 4 cm and 10 cm, 
for the experimental configurations previously described in section 2.3.1. Scatter fractions 
were estimated as described by (Manglos et al 1987): images of the point source were first 
obtained with the phantom empty ('in air' data) and then filled with a thickness of water of 4 
cm and 10 cm ('in water' data). Scatter fraction SF was estimated as: 

(

where water(i) and air(i) represent the number of counts in pixel (i) of the planar image in 
water and air respectively. The factor k is given by:

where µ is the attenuation coefficient of water at 140 keV (0.154 cm-1) and d is the depth of 
the point source in water. 

 

Scatter  fraction  values  were  experimentally  calculated  for  3  energy  windows:  140  –

 
25%  keV  (105–175  keV),  140  –
  35%  keV  (91–189 
keV), and corresponding values were derived from the simulations. Large energy windows 
were considered because of the poor energy resolution of the scintillation camera, so that 
all primary counts were included. 

  30%  keV  (98–182  keV)  and  140  –

2.3.4. Energy spectra. 
The  energy  spectra  were  experimentally  measured  over  the 
whole FOV: (1) in air, with the 99mTc point source (activity of 4.92 x 105 Bq) located at the 
centre of the FOV, at 2 cm from the collimator, (2) in water, with the  99mTc point source 
(3.54 x 105 Bq), located at the centre of the FOV at 12 cm from the collimator, under the 
cylindrical phantom filled with 4 cm and 10 cm of water. 

The  radioactive  background  coming  from  the  equipment  in  the  room  was  measured 
without  source  and  then  subtracted  from  the  measured  energy  spectra  as  the  background 
radioactivity was not simulated with GATE.  

Simulations  of  different  scintillation  camera  designs  were  first  performed  to 
characterize scatter within the device as a function of the design, for the source in air at 2 
cm from the collimator. The role of the energy deposit within the white epoxy gap between 
the crystal pixels was studied by varying the gap: 250 µm (design 2) and 100 µm (design 
3),  250  µm  being  the  actual  value  of  the  interpixel  size.  In  these  two  simulations,  the 
PSPMT was not modelled. Then, the PSPMT was modelled (design 1) using a single 8 cm 
thick  Plexiglas  layer,  7.6  cm  in  diameter.  These  dimensions  were  calculated  from  the 
weight  of  the  PSPMT  and  its  attenuating  and  scattering  properties.  For  this  design,  the 
epoxy gap was 250 µm. The energy spectra obtained for these three designs were compared 
to the experimental spectrum obtained with the source in air.  

For  the  source  in  water,  the  same  configurations  as  described  in  section  2.3.1.  were 

simulated. 

 
2.3.5. Image of a capillary phantom.  A  phantom  consisting  in  5  parallel  capillaries 
(1.55 mm in diameter, 6 cm in length), with a capillary-to-capillary distance of 3.5 mm was 
used.  The  capillaries  were  filled  with  99mTc  solutions  of  different  activities  as  shown  in 
figure  3.  The  phantom  was  located  at  1.5  mm  from  the  collimator  of  the  scintillation 
camera.

simulation.  About  140  000  photons  were  experimentally  detected  within  the  40-180  keV 
energy  window.  About  one  billion  photon  histories  were  generated  in  4p

3.4. Energy spectra 

 

Figure  8  shows  the  experimental  energy  spectrum  for  the  99mTc  point  source  and  the 
different energy spectra obtained by simulating different designs of the scintillation camera.  
The energy spectra resulting from the simulations of the crystal array (without a PSPMT 
model  behind)  with  the  actual  value  of  the  white  epoxy  gap  (design  2:  250  µm:  black 
crosses)  and  with  a  smaller  value  of  100  µm  (design  3:  grey  solid  line)  suggest  that  this 
detector  component  affects  the  energy  spectrum  between  70  and  100  keV.  This  is 
confirmed by the plot of the contribution of the photons scattered in the PSPMT shown on 
Figure 9 (left). As demonstrated by the energy spectrum corresponding to design 1 (solid 
black line), including a PSPMT model was essential to obtain a good agreement between 
measured and simulated spectra below 110 keV. 

Energy spectra obtained for the point source at 12 cm from the collimator, with 0, 4 and 
10  cm  water  thicknesses  are  shown  in  figure  9:  contributions of photons scattered within 
different  components  of  the  detector  (Plexiglas  layer  noted  PM  and  Mylar  envelope 
around the pixels) and within the phantom are also plotted. This comparison demonstrates 
an excellent agreement between simulated and experimental energy spectra.

Figure 9. Energy spectra obtained for the 99mTc point source at 12 cm from the collimator under 
a water thickness of 0, 4 and 10 cm.  

 
Within  the  40-180  energy  window,  without  any  scattering  medium,  the  total  scatter 
consisted  of  7.8%  scatter  in  the  collimator,  16.6%  scatter  in  the  Mylar  envelope,  74.5% 
backscatter  in  the  PSPMT  and  1.1%  in  the  lead  shielding.  For  the  experimental 
configuration  involving  4  cm  of  water,  scatter  in  the  phantom  represented  54.3% of total 
scatter,  while  scatter  in  the  collimator,  Mylar  envelope,  PSPMT  and  lead  shielding 
represented 3.5%, 6.9%, 34.8% and 0.5% of total scatter, respectively. For the experimental 
configuration involving 10 cm of water, scatter in the phantom represented 62.5% of total 
scatter,  while  scatter  in  the  collimator,  Mylar  envelope,  PSPMT  and  lead  shielding 
represented 3.1%, 6.8%, 27.1% and 0.5% of total scatter, respectively.

the  capillary  phantom,  as  well  as  profiles  (drawn  horizontally  and  centred,  8  pixel  thick) 
through these images with dashed line and solid line, respectively.

4. Discussion 

4.1. Spatial resolution 

Experimental PSF for a centred and an off-centred source were reliably reproduced by the 
simulations  (figures  4,  5  and  6).  This  suggests  that  GATE  is  able  to  predict  the  spatial 
response of the scintillation camera with an accuracy better than 200 µm if one considers 

14

D. Lazaro et al 

the FWHM values. Discrepancies between simulated and experimental FWTM were lower 
than  10%  in  air.  Slight  differences  between  simulation  and  experiments  could  still  be 
observed in the tails of the PSF: they might be due to imperfect modelling of the PSPMT 
non-uniform  response.  Indeed,  although  the  FEP  approach  globally  accounts  for  non-
uniformities introduced by the PSPMT response, local distortions might not be reproduced 
perfectly using this simple approach.  

A  comparison  between  GEANT4  simulations  and  theoretical  calculations  of  both 
collimator  resolution  and  sensitivity  for  parallel-hole  and  pin-hole  collimators  has 
previously  demonstrated  that  GEANT4  enables  accurate  modelling  of  interactions  within 
the  collimator  (Breton  et  al  2001).  This  feature  makes  GATE  particularly  promising  for 
simulating  collimator  design  and  configurations  involving  medium-  and  high-energy 
isotope imaging. 

4.2. Sensitivity 
As  expected,  the  experimental  sensitivity  was  constant  with  distance  for  the  parallel-hole 
collimator equipping the camera (figure 7). Difference between experimental and simulated 
sensitivity  values  were  less  than  2%  for  the  different  source-to-collimator  distances  that 
were investigated, demonstrating the reliability of GATE for accurately predicting detector 
sensitivity.  

4.3. Scatter fraction 

Scatter fractions have been often studied using Monte Carlo simulations for conventional 
scintillation cameras, but few papers report on them for small-animal scintillation cameras 
(McElry et al 2002). 

Simulations using GATE accurately estimated the scatter fractions for a point source 4 
cm  and  10  cm  deep  in  water,  with  differences  less  than  2%  and  thus  GATE  can  be 
considered  appropriate  for  estimating  the  scatter  contribution  in  the  scintillation  camera 
under consideration.  

4.4. Energy spectra 

Figures  8  and  9  suggested  that,  when  incorporating  measured  parameters  (here,  the  FEP 
map)  to  model  the  defects  of  the  detector  response,  an  overall  good  agreement  between 
simulated  and  experimental  energy  spectra  could  be  achieved  for  various  experimental 
configurations.  Some  differences  could  be  observed  between  90  and  110  keV.  These 
discrepancies might come from the FEP map estimate. The different contributions of scatter 
(figure  9)  show  the  large  proportion  of  photons  which  scatter  on  the  PSPMT  Plexiglas 
layer and confirm the need of modelling this component to properly reproduce the energy 
spectrum.  Photons  that  scattered  in  the  Mylar  envelope  rather  introduce  a  small  scatter 
background in the energy spectra.  

4.5. Image of a capillary phantom 

The  good  agreement  between  experimental  and  simulated  images  and  profiles  further 
demonstrate  that  the  simulation  was  able  to  closely  reproduce  the  characteristics  of 
experimentally acquired data. 

4.6. About the GATE simulation platform 

This study shows that the high flexibility in geometry description offered by GATE enables 
the  modelling  of  imaging  systems  with  original  design,  as  well  as  more  conventional 
systems (Santin et al 2003).

GATE  uses  the  cross-section  libraries  included  in  GEANT4  (EPDL97,  EEDL  and 
EADL),  which  are  at  the  moment  the  more  up-to-date  complete  and  consistent  libraries. 
The importance of considering appropriate cross-section libraries for scintigraphic imaging 
simulations  has  been  underlined  elsewhere  (Zaidi  2000).  The  good  agreement  between 
experimental  and  simulated  data  presented  in  this  paper  suggests  that  electromagnetic 
physical  processes  are  correctly  modelled  within  GEANT4,  hence  that  GATE  is  reliable 
from this point of view.  

A  major  drawback  of  GATE  is  the  computation  time  required  for  the  simulations, 
especially  because  no  variance  reduction  techniques  are  available  in  GEANT4  yet.  This 
computation  time  severely  penalizes  SPECT  simulations  as  the  collimator  stops  most 
incident  photons,  and  will  even  be  a  greater  problem  when  considering  more  complex 
phantom geometries, such as those involving voxelized phantoms. Different strategies are 
currently under investigation to speed up processing time, among which the parallelization 
of  the  code  and  the  'gridification'  of  GATE  (Breton  et  al  2002).  The  availability  of  the 
GATE simulation platform in the public domain has been announced for June 2004. 

5. Conclusions 

We  have  shown  that  GATE  enables  Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  a  small-animal  imaging 
scintillation  camera  prototype.  Simulations  were  found  to  agree  well  with  experimental 
measurements  in  terms  of  point  spread  functions,  energy  spectra,  sensitivities,  scatter 
fractions  and  simple  phantom  images,  suggesting  that  GATE  is  appropriate  to  mimic  the 
behaviour  of  the  prototype.  Accurate  modelling  of  the  detector  response  yet  requires  the 
incorporation of measured parameters, to account for the defect of the imaging device. Our 
results  also  suggest  that  the  energy  and  spatial  responses  of  the  PSPMT  and  subsequent 
electronics can be accurately modelled using analytical convolution models. The simulation 
model will now be used to optimize some of the components of the prototype, to model the 
response  of  the  scintillation  camera  in  tomographic  mode  (SPECT)  and  to  study  the 
feasibility  of  new  imaging  strategies.  As  the  major  drawback  of  GATE  is  the  computing 
time  required  to  run  the  simulations,  the  implementation  of  GATE  in  a  computing  grid 
environment is planned to speed up the simulations.

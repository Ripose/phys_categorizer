Abstract

The question  of the  authorship  of Shakespeare’s plays  has long been debated.  The  two

leading contenders are W.  Shakspere  (1564-1616)  and  Edward  de  Vere  the  13th  Earl  of

Oxford (1550-1604).  Here we note that Shakespeare’s references to important events and

discoveries  in  astronomy  and  geophysics  in  1572  and  1600,  but  not  to  similarly

important  events  of  1604,  1609  and  1610,  especially  given  Shakespeare’s  frequent

references to and knowledge of the physical sciences, might be able to  shed some light on

the authorship question.

 “After four centuries, Shakespeare remains the most haunting of authors,” Joseph  Sobran

has written in a new book1. “He  seems to  know  us  better  than  we know  him.”  As  time

has gone on, doubt that the actor W. Shakspere (1564-1616) wrote the  Shakespeare plays

has increased.  Furthermore, it  should be noted  that  biographies  of  Shakespeare  did  not

begin  to  take  shape  until  nearly  a  century  after  Shakespeare’s  death.    Numerous

individuals have been proposed as the author of the Shakesperean plays  including Francis

Bacon  (1561-1626),  Christopher  Marlowe  (1564-1593),  and  even  Queen  Elizabeth  I.

However, the most serious contender still left standing is Edward de Vere the  13th Earl of

Oxford (1550-1604),  himself  an  actor  and  poet,  and  the  founder  of  Shakspere’s  acting

company  the  Lord  Chamberlain’s  Men.    Summarizing  and  strengthening  previous

arguments and adding many of his own, Sobran makes perhaps the strongest  case ever for

Oxford as Shakespeare.  For  example: Shakespeare used many  sources for his plays,  but

none may have dated later than 1603; plays written by others with  the  name Shakespeare

started appearing in 1605 after Oxford’s death, but while Shakspere was  still alive; many,

including  playwrite  Ben  Johnson,  during  the  years  1604-1616,  seem  to  speak  of

Shakespeare as  being  dead;  there  is  a  confluence  of  events  in  the  Shakespearean  plays

with the  life of Oxford but  not  that  of Shakspere; the  young man to  whom many  of the

Sonnets (~1593-1600) were addressed appears  to  have been Henry  Wriothesley, Earl  of

Southampton,  a  more  unlikely  addressee  for  Shakspere  than  for  Oxford;  the  Sonnet’s,

which even Stratfordians (partisans  for Shakspere as Shakespeare) concede were written

in  the  voice  of  an  old  man,  were  written  at  a  time  when  Shakspere  was  in  his  early

thirties, while Oxford was in his fifties and ailing.  Of  course, these  literary arguments in

favor of Oxford as Shakespeare are disputed  mightily by  the  Stratfordians.  While  some

may  believe it  doesn’t  matter  who  Shakespeare was,  the  question  has  intrinsic  interest,

and, as well, the vast amount of informal and professional study  of Shakespeare might be

enhanced  by  knowledge  of  his  identity.    Here  I  note  that  Shakespeare’s  references  to

important events and discoveries in astronomy and geophysics in 1572 and 1600, but  not

to  similarly  important  events  of  1604,  1609  and  1610,  especially  given  Shakespeare’s

frequent  references  to  and  knowledge  of  the  physical  sciences2,  might  be  able  to  shed

some light on the authorship question.

Shakespeare was remarkably learned in numerous fields including medicine3, law4, and the

physical sciences2.  With regards to  astronomy,  for example, Shakespeare’s characters in

Henry IV Part I (act 2, scene 1) use the  position  of the  constellation Ursa  Major  to  tell

the  hour of the  night.   Now,  at  the  beginning of  Hamlet Bernardo says,  “Last  night  of

all,/When yond  same star  that’s  westward  from the  pole/Had made his  course  to  illume

that  part  of  heaven/Where  now  it  burns,  Marcellus  and  myself,/The  bell  then  beating

one.”    Other events in the play suggest that the star was sighted in November (see ref. 5

and refs. therein).  What might be the  identity  of the  bright star  in the  skies of Denmark

west  of  the  pole  at  1AM  on  a  November  evening  during  the  perturbed  times  in  that

Kingdom when Hamlet took  place?  Recently, Olson,  Olson  and Doescher  have  studied

this  question5.    They  could  find  no  particularly  bright  fixed  star  visible  in  the  sky  in

Denmark  in  November,  west  of  the  pole,  at  1AM.    However,  they  have  made  the

fascinating observation that the “new” star which appeared in the  sky  in November 1572

in the constellation Cassiopeia, now known to be a supernova  (SN1572A), does fulfill all

these criteria5!  The new star was described in detail by  Danish astronomer Tycho  Brahe

(1546-1601)6.    The notion that this star in Hamlet might be SN1572A is consistent  with

an earlier observation that  the  names ‘Rosenkrans’  and  ‘Guldensteren’  are  among  those

appearing in a portrait of Brahe surrounded by  coats-of-arms of his ancestors7.   In 1572

Oxford was twenty-two while Shakspere was only eight. Perhaps the memory of the  new

star was etched into the memory of eight year-old Shakspere, but  more likely into  that  of

twenty-two  year-old  Oxford  especially  as  in  England  it  was  Lord  Burghley,  Oxford’s

father-in-law, whom Queen Elizabeth asked to investigate the new heavenly development.

In 1577 a great comet was  visible in Europe,  and there would not  be another until  1607

(an  appearance  of  Haley's  comet).    Interestingly  Shakspeare  often  refers  to  comets  in

plays  such  as  Hamlet  (1600-1601)  and  Henry  VI  Part  1  (1589-1592)  plays  which

appeared  before  1607.    Perhaps  the  comet  of  1577  was  imprinted  in  the  mind  of  the

thirteen year old Shakspere, but again it is more likely to have been so for Oxford.  

In 1600 in a landmark book British physician and naturalist William Gilbert proposed  the

idea that the earth may have a magnetic field8.  Shakespeare seemed aware of this  theory:

in  Troilus  and  Cressida  (1601-1602)  he  writes,  (III.2.184-186)  “As  true  as  steel,  as

plantage to the moon,/As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,/As iron to adamant, as earth to

the  centre.” In the  same play,  (IV.2.109-111)  “But  the  strong  base  and  building  of  my

love/Is as the very centre of the earth,/Drawing all things to it.”  Thus,  Shakespeare knew,

apparently  about  recent developments in science including  SN1572A  and  also  Gilbert’s

theory  of  geomagnetism.    What  about  Shakespeare’s  knowledge  of  later  astronomical

events and discoveries?

In October  1604 near a conjunction  of  Mars,  Saturn  and  Jupiter  another  new  star  was

seen in the  sky  (SN1604A).    Shakespeare  makes  no  mention  of  SN1604A.    We  might

have expected Shakespeare to  notice SN1604A given the  observation “Saturn and Venus

in conjunction!” in Henry IV Part 2 (II.4.286).

Consider the following from Henry VI Part 1 (I.2.1-2) “Mars  his true  moving, even as in

the  heavens/So  in  the  earth,  to  this  day  is  not  known.”  This  would  appear  to  be  a

reference to the fact that the orbit of Mars was not well understood, even seen to be going

backward according to some models of its orbit proposed by the  time of Henry VI Part 1

(1589-1592).   In 1609 in his Astronomia Nova9 Kepler  discussed his first  two  laws  of

motion,  and,  in  particular  gave  the  first  proper  account  of  the  orbit  of  Mars.  So,

Shakespeare  seems  aware  of  the  problems  previous  to  1609  of  explaining  the  orbit  of

Mars,  but  despite  the  current  dating  of  five  plays  after  1609  Cymbeline  (1609-1610),

Winter’s Tale (1610-1611), The Tempest (1611), Henry VIII (1612-1613), and Two  Noble

Kinsmen  (1613),  Shakespeare  never  felt  it  important  to  mention  the  resolution  of  the

confusion over the  orbit  of  Mars.  (The  standard  dating  for  Shakespeare’s  plays  is  not

based on publication, many of which were not  published until 1623, but  on performance

dates and other evidence.)  

In 1609 based on early reports  of  the  telescope,  Galileo  Galilei  fashioned  his  own  and

turned  it  toward  the  heavens. Among the  discoveries  reported  in  his  1610  book10  were

sunspots, the phases of  Venus (similar to  the  phases  of the  Earth’s  moon), hills, valleys

and other imperfections on the surface of the  Moon,  and the  moons of Jupiter.   None of

these  discoveries  are  mentioned  in  Shakespeare.  Shakespeare’s  omission  of  these

discoveries seems striking given his substantial  knowledge and frequent mention of  such

topics.   For  example:  Shakespeare was  a  most  keen  observer  of  the  sun,  discussing  in

Henry VI Part 3 (II.1. 25-32) the  phenomenon of parhelia (“mock suns”)  which seem to

appear near the real Sun due to ice crystals. “Edward: Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three

Suns?/ Richard: Three glorius suns, each one a perfect sun;/Not separated with the racking

clouds,/But sever’d in a pale clear-shining sky./See, see! They  join, embrace, and seem to

kiss,/As if they vow’d some league inviolable:/Now are they  but  one lamp, one light, one

sun./In this the heaven figures some event.” As  well, Shakespeare refers to  the  Sun more

than  forty  times in the  late plays,  but  never  to  sunspots.    Shakespeare  appreciates  the

brightness  of  Venus  (Midsummer  Night’s  Dream  III.2.61),  and  that  Venus  can  be  an

evening (All’s Well that Ends Well  II.1.166-167)  or  morning  star  as  mentioned/See,  see!

They join, embrace, and seem to  kiss,/As  if they  vow’d  some league inviolable:/Now are

they  but  one lamp, one light, one sun./In this  the  heaven  figures  some  event.”  As  well,

Shakespeare  refers  to  the  Sun  more  than  forty  times  in  the  late  plays,  but  never  to

sunspots.  Shakespeare appreciates  the  brightness of Venus (Midsummer  Night’s Dream

III.2.61), and that  Venus can  be  an  evening  (All’s  Well  that  Ends  Well  II.1.166-167)  or

morning  star  as  mentioned  in  the  late  play  Henry  VIII  (III.2.366-367,  371-372).

Shakespeare  has  more  than  fifteen  mentions  to  the  Moon  in  the  late  plays  without

mention  of  the  imperfections  on  its  surface,  and  more  than  ten  references  to  Jupiter

without mention of its moons.

In conclusion, Shakespeare’s works show us that the instrument  he was  using to  examine

the  Heavens  was  the  human  eye—indeed  a  most  keen  and  learned  eye—but  not  a

telescope: Shakespeare knew about  SN1572A, and Gilbert’s discussion of geomagnetism

in  1600,  but  apparently  not  about  SN1604A,  sunspots,  the  phases  of  Venus,  the

imperfections  on  the  surface  of  the  Moon,  or  the  moons  of  Jupiter.    There  are  many

possible explanations why Shakespeare did not write about any of these  topics,  however,

the most parsimonious is that the Bard was not alive to know of these  new developments

in astronomy.   This  would  be  consistent  with  Oxford  (1550-1604),  but  not  Shakspere

(1564-1616) as Shakespeare.

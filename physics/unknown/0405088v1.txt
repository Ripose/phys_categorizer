Abstract

Recently,  it  became  practicable  to  study  geminate  recombination  dynamics  of

solvated electrons in polar liquids by using short pulses of light to reexcite these electrons

back  into  the  conduction  band  of  the  liquid  and  observe  a  change  in  the  fraction  of

electrons  that  escape  geminate  recombination.  In  this  Letter,  the  potential  of  this

technique  to  provide  additional  insight  into  the  recombination  dynamics  of  electrons

generated  by  charge-transfer-to-solvent  (CTTS)  photodetachment  from  monovalent

anions in polar liquids is studied theoretically. The resulting expression accounts for the
recent results for electron photodetachment from Na- in tetrahydrofuran.

1. Introduction

Photoionization  of  solute/solvent  molecules  and/or  electron  photodetachment

from anions in molecular liquids results in the formation of short-lived geminate pairs

that  undergo  recombination  and  diffusional  escape  to  the  liquid  bulk,  typically  on  the

subnanosecond time scale. Studying these dynamics provides useful information on the

reactivity of the species involved (e.g., refs. [1-5]). It also yields the initial distribution
P r( ) of thermalized, localized electrons around their geminate partners, which reflects

the photophysics of charge separation on the femtosecond time scale. [1,2,6,7] From the

theoretical  standpoint,  the  geminate  dynamics  are  fully  described  by  the  probability
) of finding the electron at the point  r in space at the moment  t = τ after
density  ρ τr;(

the photoexcitation (in the following, the geminate partner of the electron is taken as the

origin of the coordinate frame). Typically, these geminate dynamics are observed using

pump-probe  transient  absorption  spectroscopy:  a  short  laser  pulse  is  used  for

photoionization (or electron photodetachment), and second pulse of a different frequency
(delayed byτ relative to the first pulse) is used to obtain the absorption signal from the

electrons present at this delay time. [1-7] As a result, one obtains the survival probability
Ω τ( ) of the electrons

( ) = ∫

which  is  the  density  ρ τr;(

) averaged over the reaction volume. While this quantity is

important for kinetic analyses, it is much less sensitive to the initial spatial distribution of

the electrons than the probability density itself. Thus, a kinetic method which provides

additional constraints on this distribution would be very useful.

One of the promising new approaches suggested to obtain additional insight in the

recombination dynamics of geminate pairs is to use a second pump pulse to reexcite the

solvated electron and promote it into the conduction band of the solvent. The resulting

"hot" electron rapidly thermalizes and localizes at some distance away from its original

location. On average, this photoexcitation increases the separation between the electron

2.

and its geminate partner and suppresses their recombination, increasing the escape yield
of the electron. [7-15] By plotting this yield vs. the delay time τ of the reexcitation pulse,

one obtains a qualitatively different type of kinetics from that given by eq. (1).

For  electrons  in  nonpolar  liquids,  this  technique  (known  as  "photoassisted  pair

dissociation")  [11,12]  was  first  demonstrated  by  Braun  and  Scott  [7]  and  further

developed by Lukin and co-workers. [11-14] Since the escape yield of the electrons may

be determined long after the geminate stage is complete, [7,11] dc conductivity was used

to detect these escaped electrons. In these nonpolar liquids, the geminate dynamics of

electron-hole pairs are fully controlled by long-range Coulomb interaction between the

electron  and  the  hole;  [15]  the  effect  of  the  solvent  structure  on  this  interaction  is

negligible. In polar liquids, the situation is more complex since solvent molecules form a

cage around the geminate partners preventing their rapid dissociation. Ultrafast kinetic
studies of electrons photolytically detached from their parent anions, such as halides (Cl-,
Br-, I-)  [1,16,17,18,19] and pseudohalides (e.g., OH-)  [2,18,19] in aqueous solutions or
alkalide  (e.g.,  Na-)  anions  in  ethers,  [4,10,20,21]  suggest  the  formation  of  short-lived

caged pairs after charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) photoexcitation of the corresponding

anions.  It  has  been  demonstrated  experimentally  [1,2]  that  the  electron  dynamics  for

aqueous  anion  photosystems  are  accounted  for  by  a  model  in  which  the  electron

undergoes  diffusion  in  a  central  force  field  corresponding  to  a  mean-force  potential

(MFP) having a radial profile of a well with the depth of a few  kT  (thermal energy) units.

For polar liquids, transient absorbance of the solvated electron in the visible and

near  IR  may  be  used  to  determine  the  electron  concentration  at  any  delay  time.  Such

pump-probe  measurements  have  been  routinely  performed  in  the  context  of  a  3-pulse

experiment in which two (pump) pulses are used for electron generation and excitation,

respectively,  and  the  third  (probe)  pulse  is  used  for  the  detection  of  the  electron

absorbance. [8,9,10] These experiments have been pursued by several laser spectroscopy

groups (e.g., refs. [10,20,22-26]) in order to study the solvation/relaxation dynamics of

photoexcited  electrons.  The  modification  of  this  experiment  to  probe  the  geminate

dynamics of the photoexcited electron is straightforward, and such measurements have

been demonstrated by Barbara's and Schwartz's groups: Son et al. [8,9] demonstrated this

3.

technique for electrons generated by photoionization of liquid water, whereas Martini and
Schwartz  [10]  used  it  for  electrons  generated  by  Na-  CTTS  in  liquid  tetrahydrofuran

(THF).  The  practicability  of  such  3-pulse  experiments  poses  a  question,  i.e.,  what

additional inference about the geminate recombination dynamics can be obtained using

the reexcitation method?

In this Letter, we give a theoretical analysis of this method for electron dynamics

in  the  anion  CTTS  photosystems.  We  seek  a  model  suitable  to  describe  short-range

interaction that occurs in such photosystems between the geminate partners. To this end,

the result of Lukin et al. [11,12,15] (obtained for Coulomb interaction) is generalized for

the general case of an arbitrary MFP; Shushin's theory of the diffusion in the potential

well  [2,28,29] is then used to obtain the approximate solution. The result is compared
with the recent data on electron photodetachment from Na- in THF obtained by Martini

and Schwartz. [10]

It is easy to demonstrate, [29] by substituting eq. (7) into eq. (3) and integrating over

which  generalizes  the  expression  obtained  by  Lukin  et  al.  [11,15]  for  a  Coulomb
potential. From eq. (18) we obtain that  ∆Ω∞( ) >τ 0  for any attractive potential. Another

important  result  is  that  in  the  absence  of  interaction  between  the  geminate  partners,

photoexcitation of the electron has no effect on the escape yield.

In  the  derivation  given  above,  forced  diffusion  of  the  "hot"  electron  in  the
conduction band was neglected. [11-15] Let  uh r( ) be the potential for this "hot" electron,
Dh   be  its  diffusivity  and  τ
h  be  its  life  time.  The  mean  displacement  during  the
thermalization of the "hot" electron is then given by  ξ ≈ −

D u . Writing the second

Λ  is a dimensionless parameter.

The expression for  ∆Ω∞( )τ  may be further simplified using Shushin's theory of

the  diffusion  in  a  potential  well.  This  theory  has  been  used  to  simulate  the  electron

dynamics  following  CTTS  photoexcitation  of  several  aqueous  anions.  [2,30]  In  this

theory, the solution  ρ r t;(
population of the well  n t( ) (which includes all geminate pairs for which  r

the exact solution of eq. (2) for  u r( ) = 0   at  r
a≥  (see refs. [2], [27] and [28] for more

discussion  of  this  model).  Since  for  r

a>   ∇ ≈u

0 ,  the  integral  in  eq.  (17)  may  be

estimated for  r

Thus,  the  change  ∆Ω∞( )τ   in  the  escape  probability  induced  by  reexcitation  of  the
electron at  t = τ is proportional to the derivative of the survival probability  Ω τ( ) at this

delay time. We conclude that for a compact mean force potential, the 3-pulse experiment

yields much the same information as the 2-pulse experiment (see the Introduction). For

the electron dynamics in a Coulomb field [11-15] (or any other diffuse field), no such

obvious correlation between these two types of kinetics exists.

In Fig. 1, eq. (22) is put to test using the recent experimental data of Martini and
Schwartz for electron photodetachment from Na- in liquid THF. [10] The sodide anion
was  photoexcited  by  a  short  pulse  of  0.79  µm  light  and  the  resulting  trapped
photoelectron  excited  into  the  conduction  band  by  a  2  µm  laser  pulse.  The  change
∆Ω∞( )τ  in the escape yield of the electrons due to the 2 µm light photoexcitation was
determined from the (solvated) electron absorbance at 1.25 µm for t=500 ps and plotted
as a function of the time interval τ between the 0.79 µm and 2 µm laser pulses (trace (i)).
In a separate experiment, transient absorbance of the electron at 2 µm induced by the 0.79
µm pulse was determined (trace (ii)) yielding the survival probability  Ω τ( ). In Fig. 1, the
derivative of the latter curve and the function  ∆Ω∞( )τ  are compared. These two traces

appear to be very similar, supporting our general conclusion.

8.

While  this  good  correspondence  between  the  experiment  and  the  theory  is

reassuring, it would be desirable to test eq. (22) for an aqueous anion photosystem. In the

sodide/THF  photosystem,  the  relaxation  of  photoexcited  electron  (after  its  subsequent

localization  by  the  solvent)  occurs  on  the  same  time  scale  as  the  separation  of  caged
(

 pair (although the experiments of Martini and Schwartz [10,31] suggest that the

)

−
•
,

kinetics of this relaxation does not change as a function of the delay time of the 2 µm

pulse). In water, the dissociation of caged pairs in the anion CTTS photosystems is an

order  of  magnitude  longer  [1,2,16-19]  and  the  break  between  the  electron  solvation

(occurring in < 1 ps) [32,33] and the dissociation of caged pairs is more clear. Such an

experiment would be worthwhile even if no additional insight into the electron dynamics

for the CTTS photosystems is obtained: The demonstration of the correctness of eq. (22)

would lend additional support to the potential well model suggested for these dynamics

by Bradforth and coworkers. [1,2,30]

time profile of the excitation pulse is shown by the dashed line (trace (iii)). See the text

and  the  caption  to  Fig.  3A  in  ref. [10]  for  more  detail.  The  electron  is  reexcited  by  a
femtosecond pulse of 2 µm light at the delay time  τ. To obtain the survival probability,
transient absorbance of the solvated electron was determined using this 2 µm pulse as a
probe. To obtain  ∆Ω∞( )τ , the electron absorbance (1.25 µm) at t=500 ps was plotted as a
function of the delay time between the 0.79 µm and 2 µm pulses. The solid line drawn

through the open circles is a least squares biexponential fit (trace (ii)). The normalized
derivative of this curve (trace (ii)) is juxtaposed onto the data for  ∆Ω∞( )τ .

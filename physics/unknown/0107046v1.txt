ABSTRACT

Measurements of the polarization charge accumulated at the -z and the +z bases

of the pyroelectric crystals of LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 during changes in temperature are
described. An electrometer in the charge mode with its probe attached to the base under
study was used. A reference for the electrometer was established by grounding the
electrometer probe at a specific crystal temperature, i.e., zeroing the electrometer. When
the ground is broken an induced charge, held captive by the polarization charge at the
base of the crystal, remains in the probe circuit. Then as the temperature of the crystal is
changed the electrometer reads the change in the polarization charge with respect to the
polarization charge at the zeroing temperature.

Data was obtained for each type of crystal and at the -z and +z bases for three

different grounding conditions. Each experiment consisted of data accumulation for five
thermal cycles. The electrometer readings at a given temperature appeared to be different
for the three grounding conditions but the difference in the charge readings for a given
difference of temperature was independent of the grounding situation.

Measurements of the polarization charge were taken while the temperature of the

crystal was held constant for about fourteen hours. The polarization charge remained
constant at the -z and +z base as long as the temperature remained constant. These
results, the independence of the charge difference for a given temperature difference with
respect to the zeroing conditions and the constancy of the charge reading with respect to
the constancy of the crystal temperature, lead to the inference that the polarization charge
is a reproducible function of the crystal temperature and is a physical property of the
crystal.

INTRODUCTION

A description of a series of experiments to study the pyroelectric properties

intrinsic to crystals of LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 is given in this report.
An electrometer in the charge mode was attached to the -z base or the  +z base of the
crystal under study and the readings were recorded as the crystals were subjected to
cyclical changes in temperature. The zero of the electrometer was established by
grounding the probe circuit at a selected temperature. After the ground was broken the
temperature of the crystal was varied and the charge readings were recorded.  The
experiments were repeated for three different zeroing conditions for the -z and +z bases

1

of crystals of LiNbO3 and LiTaO3.  An additional series of experiments were performed
in which the crystals were held at a constant temperature, other than the temperature at
which the probe of the electrometer was grounded, for fourteen hours. The constancy of
the charge readings under this condition was studied.

In an earlier report1,2 the influence of the gaseous environment was explored with

different experiments. As previously reported3,4,5 it was found that during decreasing
temperature, that external to the crystals, electrons were accelerated away from the
crystal to sufficiently high energies to produce K x rays from a copper target facing the -z
base of the crystal. During increasing temperature electrons were accelerated to the -z
base of the crystals with enough energy to produce characteristic x rays of the constituent
elements of the crystals. The rate of production of the x rays depended on the rate of
change of the temperature of the crystals and on the pressure of the gas in the vacuum
system. There was an optimum pressure for the production of x rays from the copper
target and a slightly different pressure optimized the x-ray production from the elements
of the crystals.  Both of these "best" pressures depended on the geometry of the
experiment. It was concluded that the polarization charge or the excess space charge
produced an electric field strong enough to ionize the gas molecules and accelerate the
electrons in one direction and the positive ions in the opposite direction.

As in the previous paper2 the term "polarization charge" will refer to the charge

appearing at the surface of one side of the crystal and is fixed in the crystal. The term
"space charge" will denote the charge originating in the gas external to the crystal and
attracted to the crystal by the polarization charge.  By "pyroelectric properties" we mean
changes in the polarization charge as a result of a change of temperature of the crystal.

RESPONSE OF PYROELECTRIC CRYSTALS TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES

 Several crystals of LiNbO3 and LiTaO3, obtained from Crystal Technology Inc.,

Palo Alto, CA, were subjected to temperature cycles to study the effect of temperature
changes on the production of polarization charge at the surfaces of the crystals. The
experimental arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. The base of the crystal under study was
covered with conducting epoxy in which was embedded the probe of the electrometer,
Keithly Model 610C, operating in the charge mode. The test probe of the electrometer
was, therefore, sensitive to changes in the polarization charge at the base of the crystal.

The crystal, electrometer probe and the conducting epoxy were covered with

insulating epoxy. A conducting wire was brought out from the electrometer probe
through the insulating epoxy to the input terminal of the electrometer. The specific
arrangement portrayed in Fig. 1 represents the configuration used for the measurement of
the polarization charge at the +z base of the pyroelectric crystal under study. The +z base
is connected through the switches S1 and S3 to the electrometer. The switch S4 is shown
in the position which grounds the -z base of the crystal. The switch S2, when closed,
zeroes the electrometer, i.e., grounds the probe at a selected temperature of the crystal.
For measurements on the -z base of the crystal switches S1, S3 and S4 are switched to the
alternative positions shown as open in Fig.1.

The electrometer is a very high resistance device in which there is a capacitor, one

side of which is grounded. The output reading of the electrometer represents the charge
on the high side of the capacitor.

The experiments, performed with the apparatus arranged according to the
schematic diagram, Fig. 1, involved recording the charge reading of the electrometer as
the crystals under study were subjected to temperature cycles. Before undertaking a set of
measurements, the test probe of the electrometer was grounded at a specific temperature
of the crystal below the Curie temperature. A charge in the probe circuit, opposite in sign
to the polarization charge of the crystal at that temperature, would then be attracted to the
neighborhood of the crystal surface. When the ground is broken the electrometer reads
zero but there is an induced charge, held captive by the polarization charge, in the probe
circuit. As the temperature of the crystal is changed the electrometer readings will reflect
the change in the polarization charge with respect to the polarization charge at the
grounding temperature.

In Fig. 2 the temperature cycles applied to a crystal of LiNbO3, with a thickness

of 1.000 ± 0.001 mm and a base, 5.351 ± 0.003 mm by 3.811 ± 0.001 mm, and the
response of the electrometer are shown as functions of time for three different grounding
temperatures. For the five thermal cycles presented the temperature was varied from
about 100oC to -110oC. The data for Fig. 2(a) was obtained after the electrometer,
attached to the -z base, was grounded at about 100oC. It is seen that the charge readings
of the electrometer indicate that the polarization charge at the surface became
algebraically smaller, i.e., the amount of negative polarization charge increased as the
temperature was lowered from 100oC. This interpretation, that the amount of negative
charge at the -z base increased as the temperature was lowered, is based on the previous
study2 of x-ray production by electrons repelled from the -z base during decreasing
temperature.

The results of the experiment performed after the electrometer probe was
grounded at a crystal temperature of about 0oC are presented in Fig. 2(b). It is seen that
that the polarization charge was algebraically higher, i.e., the amount of negative charge
decreased as the temperature was raised above 0oC. As the temperature was lowered
below 0oC the polarization charge decreased algebraically, i.e., the amount of negative
charge increased.

As represented in Fig. 2(c) the data was obtained after the electrometer probe was
grounded at a crystal temperature of about -110oC. As the crystal temperature was raised
above -110oC the charge readings of the electrometer became algebraically higher, i.e.,
the amount of negative polarization charge decreased.

It is seen from Fig. 2 that, for each of the grounding choices, the electrometer

response for the five thermal cycles appears to be reproducible. But for a specific
temperature the charge reading differs for the three grounding selections.

Additional experiments were performed to measure the polarization charge at the

+z base of a crystal of LiNbO3 as the temperature of the crystal was varied. The results
for the three different grounding conditions are presented in Fig. 3. From these results
and the analysis of the experiments on the production of x rays 2; it is concluded that
there was a small amount of positive polarization charge at the +z base of the crystal at a
crystal temperature of 100oC. As the temperature of the crystal was lowered the amount
of positive polarization charge increased, i.e., increased algebraically. This fact was true
for all three zeroing choices although the charge readings were quite different for a
specific temperature in each of the three grounding processes.

3

Similar sets of data were obtained for crystals of LiTaO3 where the temperature

ranged from100oC to -150oC. The data, taken at the -z base of the crystal, which is 1.000
± 0.001 thick and has a base 4.250 ± 0.001 mm by 3.101 ± 0.001 mm, is shown in Fig,
4(a), (b) and (c) where the grounding temperature of the crystal was about 100oC, about
0oC and -150oC respectively. The charge readings for the five thermal cycles for each
grounding situation indicate that the polarization charge decreased algebraically, i.e., the
amount of negative polarization charge increased as the temperature of the crystal was
lowered. A corresponding presentation of the response at the +z base for the five thermal
cycles is given in Fig. 5.

If the only experiments performed were those represented by Figs. 2(b), 3(b), 4(b)

and 5(b), i.e., the electrometer probe zeroed at a crystal temperature of about 0oC one
might be tempted to say that the polarization charge changed sign during the monotonic
change in temperature. However, the series of experiments conducted with three different
grounding choices combined with inferences drawn from the x-ray studies2 indicate that a
consistent argument can be made for the monotonic change in polarization charge with a
monotonic change in temperature.

The working hypothesis for the series of experiments described above was that
an electrical charge was induced in the probe circuit of the electrometer opposite to the
polarization charge at the surface of the crystal, the amount of which depended on the
temperature of the crystal at which the electrometer was grounded. After the ground
connection was broken, the electrometer responded to changes in the polarization charge
of the crystal responding to changes in temperature from the grounding temperature by
reading the algebraic change in polarization charge with respect to the polarization charge
at the grounding temperature. It is expected that, although the charge reading at a specific
temperature appears to be different for the three zeroing temperatures the change in
charge for a given change in temperature is expected to be the same for the three zeroing
conditions.

The numerical data, used in the presentations Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5, were studied to
explore this expectation. The differences in the charge readings at the -z base of a crystal
of LiNbO3 for selected temperature differences are given in Table I. The selected
temperature intervals are, for increasing temperature, -100oC to -50oC, -50oC to 0oC, 0oC
to 50oC and 50oC to 100oC and, for decreasing temperature, 100oC to 50oC, 50oC to 0oC,
0oC to -50oC and -50oC to -100oC. The numbers given in Table I represent the mean
values of the charge changes for the five thermal cycles for each grounding temperature.
The precision measures given with the mean values represent the reproducibility of the
results over the five thermal cycles. Similarly the change in the charge readings for the
+z base of LiNbO3 were calculated and the results are presented in Table II.

Similar treatment was accomplished for the data on the -z and +z bases of

LiTaO3. The results are presented in Tables III and IV. In this case the temperature
intervals were, for increasing temperature -140oC to -75oC, -75oC to -25oC, -25oC to 25oC
and 25oC to 90oC and, for decreasing temperature, 90oC to 25oC, 25oC to -25oC,
-25oC to -75oC and -75oC to -140oC.

It is seen from Tables I, II, III and IV that, within the statistical errors of the

measurement, the change in the charge reading, for a specific temperature change and
specific direction of temperature change, is independent of the temperature at which the
crystal base attached to the electrometer was grounded. It is further noted from Table I

4

and II, that in LiNbO3, |∆Q| is different for the same interval of temperature, 50oC, at
different temperatures. Similarly for LiTaO3,at a temperature interval of 65oC,|∆Q| is
different for two different temperatures as shown in Tables III and IV. Furthermore for an
interval of 50oC at two different temperatures |∆Q| is different. As was noted in earlier
work6-10 the response between |∆Q| and |∆T| is not linear.

An experiment was performed to observe the charge readings as the temperature

of the crystal was held constant. At the start of the experiment the electrometer probe
attached to a crystal base was grounded at about 0oC and after the ground was broken the
temperature was raised to 115oC and held constant for about fourteen hours. The results
are presented in Figs. 6 and 7. The start of the procedure is shown in Fig. 6(a), i.e., the
ground was broken after 20 seconds and the temperature was raised. The charge readings
at the  +z base of one crystal of LiNbO3, 27.5 mm2 by 1 mm, and at the -z base of another
crystal of LiNbO3, 18.63 mm2 by 1mm, is exhibited. Then after fourteen hours the
temperature of the crystals is decreased, as is shown in Fig. 6(b). The results obtained
during the fourteen hours of constant temperature are presented in Fig. 7, where the
temperature and charge readings were recorded every 5 sec.  It is seen that, during the
period of constant temperature, the charge readings on the crystals were constant. In fact
for the interval of 5,000 sec to 48,000 sec the mean temperature was 115.6552 ±
0.0014oC and during that time the charge reading on the +z base of a crystal was
(-1.23956 ± 0.00005) x 10-7  coul  and on the -z base of the other crystal the charge
reading was (1.00597 ± 0.00007) x 10-7 coul.
          A current reading device would show a non-zero reading as the polarization charge
increases, Fig. 6(a). The magnitude of the current reading would vary with the rate of
change of charge, i.e., the rate at which the temperature changes. For the interval of
constant charge, i.e., constant temperature, Fig. 7, the current reading would be zero.
Then when the temperature began to decrease, Fig. 6(b), resulting in a change in
polarization charge the current reading would be other than zero with a magnitude
varying with the rate of change of temperature. It is to be noted that in certain types of
experiment in which the base of the crystal is exposed to the gasses of the vacuum system
the current drops to zero when the space charge neutralizes the polarization charge 2. On
occasion a discharge between the gasses and the crystal will partially neutralize the
polarization charge and the current reading will drop to zero3, 5. Under suitable gas
pressure, the discharges will not occur and the current vs temperature curve will be
smooth, i.e., devoid of sudden changes.

The results of the two types of experiments reported above are consistent with the
inference that the crystals of LiNbO3  and LiTaO3, at specific crystal temperatures, show
definite polarization charges which are reproducible properties of the crystals.

CONCLUSION

It was seen in previous experimental studies of crystals of LiNbO3 and LiTaO3

1, 2

that electrons, produced in the neighboring gasses of the crystals, were repelled by the -z
base of the crystals during decreasing temperature and attracted to the -z base of the
crystals during increasing temperature.  These laboratory results were produced by the
increase of excess negative polarization charge, during a decrease in the temperature of
the crystal, at the -z base. During a temperature increase the amount of negative
polarization charge decreased and the excess positive space charge attracted the electrons
to the -z base.

In the series of experiments on LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 described in this report it was

seen that for a given change in temperature the change in the charge readings of the
electrometer attached to the base of the crystal was independent of the initial zeroing
conditions. Furthermore, the charge readings remained constant when the temperature of
the crystals was maintained at a constant value. The electric current was non-zero at the
start of the run, with magnitude depending on the rate of change of temperature. The
current became zero during the period of constant temperature. It became non-zero as the
temperature was lowered, the magnitude depended on the rate of change of temperature.
It is concluded, therefore, that at a given temperature the crystals under study will exhibit
a definite polarization charge in a reproducible manner. This production of specific
polarization charge is an intrinsic property of the crystals. In a certain amount of time,
which depends on the pressure of the gas in the vacuum system and the geometry of the
apparatus, the external effects of the polarization charge will be reduced considerably by
the accumulation of space charge at the base of the crystal.
       The change in the polarization charge for a given temperature interval varies with the
temperature of the crystal for LiNbO3 and LiTaO3, i.e., the change in the polarization
charge is not proportional to the change in temperature but is a non-linear function of the
temperature.

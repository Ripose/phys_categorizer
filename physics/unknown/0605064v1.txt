In the GCP network, an Internet system of noise generators developed under the direction 
of  Prof.  R.  Nelson  and  deployed  at  various  geographical  points,  synchronous 
measurements of a priori random noise processes are carried out every second [1, 2]. The 
time  series  obtained  in  these  measurements  are  “quite  random”  from  the  viewpoint  of 
traditional  methods of statistical analysis. However, as shown in our works [3-13], using 
the method of histogram comparison allows one to discover clear regularities in the noise 
processes  of  any  nature,  from  biochemical  reactions  to  radioactive  decay  or  noise  in  the 
gravitational antenna. These regularities cannot be revealed by the traditional methods of 
time  series  analysis  and  seem  to  be  determined  by  fluctuations  of  the  space-time,  which 
result  from  the  movement  of  the  “laboratory”  relative  to  the  mass  thicknesses  (celestial 
bodies) [4-6, 13]. The application of this method to the analysis of time series of the GCP 
system  showed  all  the  main  regularities  described  earlier:  the  histogram  pattern  changes 
with well-resolved sidereal and solar daily periods; at different geographical points, similar 
histogram patterns are highly probable to appear at the same local time; histograms with a 
specific  “eclipse”  pattern  appear  synchronously  “all  over  the  Earth”  at  the  moments  of 
culmination of a solar eclipse.  

1. INTRODUCTION. 

The  initial  material  for  our  studies  of  the  effect  of  macroscopic  fluctuations  is  time  series  of 

amplitude  fluctuations  obtained  by  measuring  parameters  of  processes  of  various  nature.  Their 

analysis by the  method  of histogram analysis [3,4] revealed a number of periods  relating to the 

increased probability of histograms of a certain pattern to appear [11,13]. It was also found that 

the probability of similar histogram patterns to appear increases synchronously by local time [13]. 

To  investigate  the  effect  of  synchronization  by  local  time  we  need  to  conduct  measurements  at 

different  geographical  points.  In  this  connection,  appearing  very  promising  were  time  series 

obtained with a world-wide network of physical random number generators, which was deployed 

within the framework of the GCP project. The first analyses performed in 2000 yielded reassuring 

results, but the further acquaintance with the working algorithm of GCP generators cast serious 

doubts upon the applicability of GCP series to the study of our effects. They were due to the use 

of  the  “exclusive  OR”  operation,  i.e.  XOR-mask,  on  the  output  of  a  physical  random  number

generator.  In  this  connection,  the  use  of  GCP  series  in  the  studies  of  the  effect  of  macroscopic 

fluctuations was suspended.  

In  the  present  work,  a  possibility  to  use  data  of  the  GCP  monitoring  for  the  study  of  the 

effect  of  macroscopic  fluctuations  has  been  demonstrated.  We  have  revealed  the  major 

regularities,  characteristic for the phenomenology of the effect of macroscopic fluctuations, and 

have analysed the distortions caused by the XOR-mask in the pattern of histograms.  

2. A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE GCP NETWORK. 

At  present,  the  GCP  project  unites  more  than  60  computer  random  number  generators  (RNGs) 

placed  at  different  points  of  the  globe  [1].  Each  of  them  performs  continuous  monitoring  of  a 

noise process, which depends on the type of the physical process used in this RNG. Generators 

are connected, through Internet, to a server in Princeton. It performs functions of data collection 

and processing and also maintains a database, being continuously filling since 1988 [1]. All RNGs 

are synchronized through Internet; the data synchronization occurs periodically (once per second) 

all over the network. After synchronization, data are transferred to the server in Princeton, where 

they are recorded in the database with open access [2]. 

There  are  three  types  of  RNGs  used  in  the  GCP  project.  In  general,  they  have  the  same 

construction and differ by the type of the source of white noise. The following sources of noise 

are used:  

1)  thermal noise in a resistor;  

2)  noise in a field-effect transistor; 

3)  noise in Zener diodes. 

The  working  algorithm  of  a  typical  generator  of  the  GCP  network  is  the  following.  The 

analog signal from an RNG, having a uniform spectrum on the frequency band from 1100 Hz to 

30 kHz, goes to a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 1000 Hz, which removes frequencies 

below  the  digitizing  rate.  After  amplification,  the  low-frequency  signal  is  transformed  into  a 

meander, allowing one to continue work with a digital representation of the signal.  

The digital processing of a signal is carried out by applying a XOR-mask, which performs 

the  “exclusive  OR”  operation  over  the  meander  obtained  and  the  impulses  of  a  clock  generator 

with  a  frequency  of  1000  Hz.  After  the  XOR-mask, the  number  of  bits  of  the  output  sequence, 

corresponding to 200 periods of the clock generator, is counted. The resulting value represents the 

output signal of the RNG. It is recorded into the database in Princeton and stored there as a point 

in a time series.

2. MATERIALS AND METHODS. 

In  the  analysis  of  time  series  obtained  from  GCP  generators,  we  used  methods,  which  were 

elaborated and used by us during many decades [3-5,7]. The methods are based on the pairwise 

comparison of similarity of patterns of smoothed histograms constructed for non-overlapped short 

segments  of  time  series.  All  procedures  of  constructing,  scaling,  smoothing  etc.  are  performed 

with a computer program Histogram Manager by Edwin Pozharsky. However, the decision about 

similarity  of  two  histograms  is  made  by  an  expert based on a visual evaluation. We have to do 

expert  evaluation  since  there  is  no  effective  computer  algorithms  for  comparing  histogram 

patterns, which would be adequate to the integral evaluation by a human-expert. These problems 

were considered in detail earlier [3,4,13]. 

A remarkable property of histograms is independence of their pattern of the alteration order 

of results of measurements within the segment of a time series taken to construct a histogram. For 

example, for each histogram from those usually used in our works (constructed from 60 points of 
a time series), there are about 1082 of different realizations of a 60-point segment of a time series, 

which  keep  the  histogram  pattern  invariant.  The  histogram  pattern  reflects  the  spectrum  of 

amplitude  fluctuations  of  a  measured  quantity  within  a  given  segment  of  a  time  series.  As  we 

showed, the shape of this spectrum is determined by cosmo-physical causes [13]. 

The regularities in the change of histogram pattern do not depend on the nature of a process 

and can be found in “absolutely random”, from the viewpoint of traditional criteria, time series. 

This  was  confirmed  by  our  many  years  investigation  of  time  series  obtained  by  measuring 

fluctuations of various processes [3-13]. 

3. RESULTS. 

 

 

Using  our  methods  of  analysis,  we  have  found  all  major  phenomena  of  “macroscopic 

fluctuations”  in  the  time  series  of  the  GCP  network.  This  means  that  the  cosmo-physical  laws, 

which earlier were shown to be inherent in any physical stochastic processes, are revealed in the 

system of the GCP generators.  

The  figures  presented  below  are  to  demonstrate  that  the  main  regularities  obtained  upon 

studying the time series of various physical processes are identical to the regularities found for the 

time series generated by the RNGs of the GCP network.  

Fig. 4a shows a time series, which is a direct result of registration of noise from generator 

No. 28 (Roger Nelson, Princeton, NJ, USA, 40°35′ latitude north and 74°65′ longitude west) of 

April 8, 2005. Fig. 4b represents a distribution function constructed on the basis of the signal of 

3

Fig.  4a.  One  can  note  the  complete  absence  of  any  trends  and  clear  correspondence  to  “white 

noise”.

distribution function (b).  
 
According to the standard method for our research [3,4,7], the time series (Fig. 4a) was divided to 

non-overlapping  segments,  with  30  measurements  in  each  of  them.  For  every  such  segment,  a 

histogram was constructed, which then was smoothed with a 4-point square window for 3 times. 

Each  histogram  thus  corresponds  to  a  30-second  segment  of  the  source  time  series.  All  further 

work was carried out with these histograms saved in a computer archive of Histogram Manager. 

Fig. 5 shows a fragment of this journal, which illustrates a sequence of 35 smoothed histograms, 

corresponding to the successive 30-point segments of the time series.

Fig. 6. A fragment of the computer archive: examples of pairs, in which histograms are qualified by an 
expert as similar.  
 
The  main  method  of  further  analysis  is  pairwise  comparison  of  histogram  patterns  and 

 

construction  of  a  distribution  of  the  number  of  matches  depending  on  the  duration  of  the  time 

interval  between  them.  To  obtain  significant  distributions  one  needs  to  perform  thousands  of 

pairwise  comparisons.  In  the  process  of  comparison,  the  expert  is  allowed  to  do  linear 

transformations of the histogram pattern: stretching/squeezing, shifting, mirror transformation.  

Given  in  Fig.  6  are  examples  of  pairs  of  neighbour  histograms,  which  are  qualified  to  be 

similar upon the expert evaluation. This figure also illustrates the above-mentioned difficulty in 

algorithmization  of  the  process  of  histogram  comparing.  An  expert  would  easily  evaluate  the 

similarity of the “idea of form”, while various algorithmic estimations appear to be of little use 

[5,13]. 

 

1)  The  effect  of  “near  zone”  is  the  first  piece  of  evidence  for  the  cosmo-physical 

conditionality for the histogram patterns in the time series of the GCP system.  

The  first  and  most  easily  revealed  manifestation  of  “macroscopic  fluctuations”  is  the  effect  of 

“near  zone”.  It  means  a  significantly  higher  probability  of  near,  neighbour  histograms  to  be 

similar. This effect can be clearly seen in the time series created by GCP generators. An example 

is  given  in  Fig. 7.  It  demonstrates  how  the  number  of  similar  pairs  of  0.5-min  histograms 

constructed from the data of Fig. 3 changes with the increase of the time interval between them.  

Fig. 7a shows that in a set of 700 histograms (so was the analysed segment of a data series), 

80 pairs of the nearest neighbours (i.e. with the time interval of 0.5 min) are found to be similar, 

and for each of other, longer intervals, the number of similar pairs does not exceed 32. In Fig. 7b, 

the same distribution is shown with the values of mean-square errors. The effect of “near zone” 

 

5

implies  the  existence  of  a  general  external  cause,  which  determines  the  histogram  pattern.  And 

this suggests that the fine structure of histograms is not casual.

2)  The  synchronous,  by  local  and  absolute  time,  appearance  of  similar  histograms  at 

different  geographical  points  is  the  second  piece  of  evidence  for  the  cosmo-physical 

conditionality for the histogram patterns in the time series of the GCP system.  

The  second,  after  the  effect  of  “near  zone”,  piece  of  evidence  of  the  histogram  pattern  being 

determined  by  cosmo-physical  factors  is  the  dependence  of  this  pattern  on  the  rotation  of  the 

Earth around its axis.  

We showed a high probability of similar histogram patterns to be realized synchronously by 

local time upon measurements of α-activity of 239Pu [3–13], noise in a gravitational antenna [3], 

dark current fluctuations in photomultipliers [7], rates of chemical reactions [13]. Simultaneously 

with measurements in our laboratory in Pushchino, there were measurements carried out aboard 

ships during expeditions in the Indian Ocean, in the Arctic and Antarctic; and in the laboratories 

of  Russia  (St.  Petersburg,  Moscow),  Georgia  (Tbilisi),  Germany  (Neuss,  Lindau),  Greece 

(Athens), Spain (Valencia), USA (Columbus). The local-time synchronism did not depend on the 

geographical  latitude  and  the  nature  of  the  process  studied  and  was  observed  with  a  high 

accuracy: with a resolution of 1 min at any distance between laboratories (up to 14000 km) [13].  

It  turns  out  that  the  time  series  obtained  from  generators  of  the  GCP-system  are  not  an 

exclusion.  Similar  histograms  are  observed  synchronously  by  local  time  upon  the  GCP-

measurements at different geographical points.  

In  a  number  of  cases,  we  observed  also  an  absolute-time  synchronism  upon  study  of 

physical processes, when similar histograms were highly probable to be realized at the same time. 

 

6

However, such a global absolute synchronism appears differently in different experiments, and we 

failed  to  reveal  a  clear  regularity  in  this  phenomenon.  Probably,  the  situation  with  GCP 

measurements is analogous. This is illustrated in Fig. 8-15.  

Fig. 8 shows the dependence of the probability of similar histogram patterns to appear upon 

comparison of the results of measurements of June 7-8, 2000, which were taken from generators 

No. 28 (Roger Nelson, Princeton, NJ, USA; 40°350′ latitude north and 74°659′ longitude west) и 

No.  37  (John  Walker,  Switzerland;  47°079′  latitude  north  and  7°062′  longitude  east).  The  local 

time difference is 327 min. As can be seen in Fig. 8, it is the time interval, corresponding to which 

is an extremum, namely the maximal probability of appearance of similar histograms constructed 

for the time series from those two generators. The right part of the same figure demonstrates the 

absence of any significant synchronism by absolute time.

appear synchronously by local time, but there is also a notable synchronism by absolute time.

comparison  of  histograms  constructed  from  our  typical  results  of  measurements  of  239Pu  α-

activity and histograms constructed on the basis of data from the GCP generators. The results of 

this comparison are shown in Fig. 13-14.

3)  The  “sidereal”  and  “solar”  daily  periods  in  the  change  of  the  probability  of  recurring 

appearance  of  similar  histogram  patterns  is  the  third  piece  of  evidence  for  the  cosmo-

physical conditionality of histogram patterns in the time series of the GCP-system  

As we have shown upon studying various physical processes, there are two clearly distinguishable 

daily periods in the change of the probability of histogram patterns to be similar: one of them is 

equal to the solar day (1440 min) and another is equal to the sidereal day (1436 min) [11]. As can 

be  seen  in  Fig. 15,  exactly  the  same  periods  are  revealed  in  the  sequences  of  histograms 

constructed for the time series from the GCP generators.

results of three separate comparisons. Along the abscissa axis is the time interval between similar

4)  The  synchronous  realization  of  a  characteristic  histogram  pattern  at  the  moments  of 

culminations  of  solar  eclipses  is  the  forth  piece  of  evidence  for  the  cosmo-physical 

conditionality of histogram patterns in the time series of the GCP-system  

The  data  presented  above  were  obtained  by  a  traditional  for  our  studies  technique,  i.e.  by  the 

pairwise comparison  of histograms, calculation of the time interval between similar histograms, 

and construction of the distributions of the number of similar histogram pairs by the duration of 

the interval between histograms. This is a hard work. To construct each of the graphs given in the 

figures, we had to evaluate about 7000 of histogram pairs.  

However, several years ago we found a cosmo-physical phenomenon, whose study does not 

require searching through dozens of histogram combinations. It turns out that at the moments of 

the  new  moon,  a  characteristic  histogram  pattern  is  realized  with  high  probability  practically 

simultaneously all over the Earth, at various geographical points from the Arctic to Antarctic, in 

the West and East hemispheres [9]. Recently, an analogous phenomenon has been discovered for 

the moments of solar eclipse culminations [14]. Let us leave the discussion of the physics of these 

amazing phenomena for a special analysis and note a change in the method, which is of principle 

importance. To reveal histogram patterns, specific for the new moon or solar eclipses, one need 

not to search for similar pairs through all the array of histograms. What we can do is to check at 

once is there a characteristic histogram pattern at a certain calculated moment. The application of 

this  method  to  the  series  obtained  from  the  GCP  generators  (with  the  purpose  to  analyse 

 

11

histograms,  specific  for  culminations  of  solar  eclipses)  has  confirmed  the  conclusion  on  the 

cosmo-physical conditionality of the corresponding histograms. The results are given in Fig. 16-

24.

constructed from the results of measurements of  239Pu α-activity in our Pushchino laboratory on

latitude north and 74°659′ longitude west) collected during the solar eclipse of April 8, 2005. The 

calculated  moment  of  the  eclipse  culmination  and  the  appearance  of  the  characteristic  pattern 

coincide with the accuracy of 0.5 min (histogram No. 2486). Fig. 18 demonstrates a series of 0.5-

min histograms constructed from the data of GCP generators No. 37 (John Walker, Switzerland; 

47°079′ latitude north and 7°062′ longitude east) on April 8, 2005. No. 2486 corresponds to the 

calculated moment of eclipse culmination; the histogram of the characteristic pattern (No. 2487)

characteristic pattern (No. 43, red-colored) is realized exactly at the calculated time.  
 
The  given  series  of  figures  shows  that  the  histograms  of  the  specific  for  the  culmination  of  the 

solar eclipse pattern are realized exactly at the calculated time – both upon the measurements of 

radioactivity  and  upon  the  data  generation  in  the  GCP-network.  Therefore,  this  parameter  also 

reflects  the  cosmo-physical  nature  of  the  factors  that  determine  the  fine  structure  (pattern)  of 

histograms.  

 

 

4. NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF THE ALGORITHM FOR PROCESSING OF DATA 

OBTAINED FROM THE PHYSICAL RANDOM NUMBER GENERATORS USED IN 

THE GCP-NETWORK. 

As noted in the Introduction, one of the questions raised in connection with the use of the GCP-

network  data is the following: how  much does the application of the XOR-mask “corrupt” data 

obtained from a physical random number generator? In other words, wouldn’t a physical random 

number  generator  be  transformed  into  a  logical  one,  such  as  a  computer  random  number 

generator, whose output data will depend not on a physical process but on the algorithm applied? 

The data presented above suggest a negative answer to this question. Nevertheless, we consider 

necessary  to  examine  the  results  of  a  numerical  simulation  of  the  effect  of  XOR-mask  on  the 

histogram pattern.  

The  numerical  model,  which  is  designed  to  examine  the  possibility  of  using  the  GCP-

network data for study of the effect of macroscopic fluctuations, simulate the process of retrieval 

and pre-processing of experimental data by the physical generators used in the GCP-network. The 

working algorithm of this numerical model is given below.  

15

Fig. 24a represents an initial signal, analogous to the signal from a physical random number 

generator  after  a  low-pass  filter.  This  signal  is  transformed  into  a  meander  according  to  the 

following algorithm:

The results of transformation of the input sequence (Fig. 24a) into the sequence of bits according 

to  (1)  is  given  in  Fig.  24b.  The  algorithm  (1)  allows  one  to  transform  an  analog  signal  into  a 

 

16

digital  binary  sequence.  This,  in  its  turn,  allows  one  to  apply  to  the  output  sequence  a  mask  of 

“exclusive OR”. To do this, one should prepare a sequence of periodically alternating zeros and 

unities:

which  is  given  in  Fig.  24c.  The  sequences 

01S

and 

outS

  have  the  same  length.  The  operation  of 

“exclusive OR” is realized according to the following algorithm:  

 
The result of applying the algorithm (3) to the sequences shown in Fig. 24b and 24c is given in 

Fig. 24d.  

As noted above, a single point of the output signal of the physical random number generator 

is a result of summation of the number of unities over 200 beats of the SXOR signal. Therefore, to 

get  an  output  sequence  of  1000-point  length,  one  needs  sequences  Sout  and  S01  of  200000-point 

length. Fig. 25 demonstrates two sequences, 

200

outS

 and 

200

XORS

, every point of which is obtained by 

summation of 200 points of Sout and SXOR. It is necessary to note that every point of the sequence 

200

outS

 is also obtained by summation of 200 points of the sequence S

out.  

The  signals 

200

outS

  and 

200

XORS

  given  in  Fig.  25  were  further  examined  by  the  technique  of 

histogram analysis briefly described above. The examination revealed that the application of the 

XOR-mask preserves the main extrema that are characteristic for histograms of the sequence  S

200
out

 

and only slightly distorts the histogram shape. This fact is in agreement with the data presented 

above, which demonstrate the main laws of the phenomenon of macroscopic fluctuations. At the 

same  time,  the  distortions  caused  by  the  mask  can  make  impossible  the  distinction  of  complex 

histogram  patterns.  Thus,  for  example,  analysing  the  time  series  from  the  GCP  generators,  we 

failed  to  reveal  the  histogram  patterns  characteristic  for  the  new  moon  [9]  (they  have  a  more 

complex structure than  the “solar eclipse”  patterns presented in this work). Nevertheless, as the 

extrema  coincide,  we  can  hope  that  the  use  of  methods  of  statistical  manipulation,  which  is 

possible  owing  to  a  quite  large  length  of  the  GCP  series,  will  allow  us  to  distinguish  rather 

complex patterns.

4. Discussion 

As follows from the data presented, the time series produced by the generators of the GCP-system 

reveal  all  the  main  signs  of  “macroscopic  fluctuations”,  i.e.  the  regular  changes  in  the  fine 

structure  of  the  spectrum  of  fluctuations  or,  in  other  words,  in  the  pattern  of  the  corresponding 

histograms.  Therefore,  the  pattern  of  these  histograms is determined by cosmo-physical factors, 

resulting  from  the  spatial  anisotropy  and  temporal  heterogeneity  of  our  universe  [5,  6  13].  The 

application  of  the  XOR-mask  does  not  remove  the  dependence  on  physical  factors  in  the  time 

series obtained from the generators of the GCP-network.  

We do not consider our conclusions as contradicting the results obtained within the scope of 

the GCP-project, since they are based on such methods of analysis of time series, which differ, in 

principle, from those used in this project. At the same time, we hope that our results may be useful 

for the GCP-community.  

It  should  be  noted  that  the  long-term  measurements  in  the  GCP-system  are  exceptionally 

valuable. They may contain a great deal of information on cosmo-physical factors and processes, 

which can be revealed by the method of histogram analysis.  

In this paper, we almost do not concern questions on the nature of the effects observed. The 

hypotheses  and  attempts  of  theoretical  interpretation  of  the  phenomena  observed,  which  have 

been proposed for many years, are summarized in the review [13].

 The flow transition to turbulence still largely remains an unsolved fluid dynamics problem. The 
stability of parallel flows is still a research subject for the turbulent transition for studies despite 
much works in the literature. In previous works, we have shown that the flow instability in wall 
shear flows depends on the relative magnitude of energy gradient and the energy loss for a given 
disturbance.  For  pipe  and  plane  Poiseuille  flows,  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  subcritical 
transition to turbulence for wall bounded parallel flows occurs at a consistent value of the energy 
gradient parameter. In this study, the critical condition for subcritical transition in annulus flow is 
calculated for various radius ratios. The critical flow rate and critical Reynolds number are given 
for various radius ratios. These results have wide implications for many fluid delivery devices.

INTRODUCTION 
 

   Annulus flow passage is widely used in aero-engines, turbomachinery and various chemical industrial devices. 
The flow dynamics in the annulus has significant influence on the performance and flow efficiency of the devices. The 
flow  in  the  annulus  may  be  laminar  or  turbulent  depending  on  the  behaviour  of  the  main  flow  and  the  disturbance 
level. Generally, the disturbance level in turbomachinery is very high so that the flow is likely to be turbulence in most 
circumstances. However, the flow may be kept laminar if the flow passage is carefully designed. The determination of 
the critical condition for the flow transition in annulus is therefore of great interest.  

   Flow  instability  and  turbulence  transition  have  been  challenging  topics  for  fluid  dynamists  for  more  than  a 
century.  This  problem  has  not  been  solved  fully  owing  to  the  many  difficulties  encounted  [1-2].  There  exist  a  few 
theories  for  the  analysis  of  flow  instabilities.  These  are  linear  stability  analysis,  energy  method,  weekly  nonlinear 
method, secondary instability theory,  and others [1-2]. Linear stability analysis was successful for some flows such as 
Taylor-Coutte  flow  and  Rayleigh-Benard  flow.  But,  it  is  failed  for  some  flows  such  as  plane  Poiseuille  flow,  pipe 
Poiseuille flow, and plane Couette flow [1-2]. The pipe Poiseuille flow (Hagen-Poiseuille) is stable by linear stability 
analysis for all the Reynolds number Re.  However, experiments showed that the flow would become turbulence if Re 
(=ρUD/µ)  exceeds  a  value  of  about  2000.  Linear  stability  analysis  of  plane  parallel  flow  gives  a  critical  Reynolds 
number Re (=ρ 0u h/µ) of 5772, while experiments show that transition to turbulence occurs at the Reynolds number of 
order  1000  [3-4].  For  plane  Couette  flow,  the  flow  is  stable  for  all  Re  from  linear  theory  consideration,  but  the 
experiments show a critical value of Re of 370. 
        The  energy  method  uses  the  Reynolds-Orr  equation  and  involves  the  integration  of  energy  for  the  entire  flow 
domain.    Using  the  energy  method,  the  critical  Re  is  88,  26  and  40  respectively  for  plane  Poiseuille  flow,  pipe 
Poiseuille  flow  and  plane  Couette  flow  [1].  Therefore,  the  non-uniformity  in  using  this  method  to  predict  the  flow 
transition  is  still  imminent.  On  the  other  hand,  the  occurrence  of  stability  is  strictly  a  local  behaviour  and  the  flow 
during  the  transition  is  intermittent.  The  first  occurrence  of  the  flow  instability  generally  takes  place  in  the  most 
“dangerous”  positions  as  seen  in  the  formation  of  turbulence  spot,  the  cylinder  wake,  and  the  dynamic  stall  on  the 
airfoil  with  large  attack  angle.  Hence,  a  method  considering  the  local  flow  behaviour  may  be  the  correct  approach.  
The weekly nonlinear method [5] and the secondary instability theory [6] seem to give better results than the above-
mentioned other methods and can explain some phenomena; however there is still discrepancy with experiments. 
        Recently, Dou [7] proposed a new approach to study flow instability and turbulent transition. It is demonstrated 
that the plane and the pipe Poiseuille flows have a consistent critical condition at the subcritical transition condition 
determined  by  experiments.  In  this  paper,  following  the  proposed  principle  of  energy  gradient  theory,  the  critical 
condition  for  subcritical  transition  in  annulus  flow  is  calculated  for  various  radius  ratios.  The  critical  flow  rate  and 
critical Reynolds number are also obtained for various radius ratios.

ENERGY GRADIENT THEORY 
 
        Dou [7] proposed an energy gradient theory with the aim to clarify the mechanism of transition from laminar to 
turbulence for wall bounded shear flows. Here, we shall give a short discussion /description for a better understanding 
of the present work. In the theory, the whole flow field is treated as an energy field. It is suggested that the gradient of 
total energy in the transverse direction of the main flow and the viscous friction in the streamwise direction dominate 
the instability phenomena and hence the flow transition for a given disturbance. The energy gradient in the transverse 
direction has the potential to amplify a velocity disturbance, while the viscous friction loss in the streamwise direction 
can  resist  and  absorb  this  disturbance.  The  flow  instability  or  the  transition  to  turbulence  depends  on  the  relative 
magnitude of these two roles of energy gradient amplification and viscous friction damping to the initial disturbance. It 
is noted that the energy loss (
)  in unit length in streamwise direction due to viscous friction is equal to the 
sH ∂
/
∂
gradient of total energy (
) of unit volume fluid in streamwise direction for pressure driven flows. As such, a 
sE ∂
∂ /
new dimensionless parameter, K (the ratio of the energy gradient in the transverse direction to that in the streamwise 
direction), is defined to characterize the stability of the base flow for the case where there is no work input,

Furthermore, ρ is the fluid density, g is the gravity acceleration, V is the velocity, and p is the hydrodynamic pressure. 
For shear driven flows (there is work input), the calculation of K can be obtained by the ratio of the energy gradient in 
transverse direction and the energy loss in unit length along the streamline [8],

As  such,  the  parameter  K  in  Eq.(1)  is  a  field  variable.  Thus,  the  distribution  of  K  in  the  flow  field  and  the 
characteristics of disturbance may serve as the means to describe if there is a disturbance amplification or decay in the 
flow. It is suggested that the flow instability can first occur at the position of 
maxK  which is construed to be the most 
“dangerous” position.  Thus, for a given disturbance, the occurrence of instability depends on the magnitude of this 
dimensionless  parameter  K  and  the  critical  condition  is  determined  by  the  maximum  value  of  K  in  the  flow.  For  a 
given flow geometry and fluid properties, when the maximum of K in the flow field is larger than a critical value 
cK , 
it  is  expected  that  instability  can  occur  for  certain  initial  disturbance  [7].  For  a  given  flow,  K  is  proportional  to  the 
global Reynolds number. A large value of K has the ability to amplify the disturbance, and vice versa. The analysis has 
suggested  that  the  transition  to  turbulence  is  due  to  the  energy  gradient  and  the  disturbance  amplification[7],  rather 
than  just  the  linear  eigenvalue  instability  type  as  stated  in  [3,4].  Both  Trefethen  et  al.  [3]  and  Grossmann  [4] 
commented  that  the  nature  of  the  onset-of-turbulence  mechanism  in  parallel  shear  flows  must  be  different  from  an 
eigenvalue instability of linear equations of small disturbance. In fact, finite disturbance is needed for the turbulence 
initiation in the range of finite Re as found in experiments [9]. Dou [7] demonstrated that the criterion obtained has a 
consistent value at the subcritical condition of transition determined by the experimental data for plane Poiseuille flow, 
pipe Poiseuille flow as well as plane Couette flow (see Table 1). The data in Table 1 may suggest that the subcritical 
cK ≈ 385  and  the  subcritical  transition  in  parallel  flows  takes 
condition  of  transition  for  Poiseuille  flows  occurs  at 
cK ≈ 370-385.  This  finding  further  suggests  that  the  flow  instability  is  likely  resulted  from  the 
place  at  a  value  of 
action of energy gradients, and not due strictly to the eigenvalue instability of linear equations. Using energy gradient 
theory,  it  is  also  demonstrated  that  the  viscous  flow  with  an  inflectional  velocity  profile  is  unstable  for  both  two-
dimensional and axisymmetrical flows [10].  
         For plane Poiseuille flow, this said position where Kmax> Kc should then be the most dangerous location for flow 
breakdown, which has been confirmed by Nishioka et al’s experiment [11]. Nishioka et al's [11] experiments for plane 
Poiseuille flow showed details of the flow breakdown. The measured instantaneous velocity distributions indicate that 
the first oscillation of the velocity occurs at y/h=0.50~0.62.  For pipe flow, in a recent study, Wedin and Kerswell [12] 
showed that there is the presence of the "shoulder" in the velocity profile at about r/R=0.6 from their solution of the 
traveling waves. They suggested that this corresponds to where the fast streaks of traveling waves reach from the wall. 
It  can  be  construed  that  this  kind  of  velocity  profile  as  obtained  by  simulation  is  similar  to  that  of  Nishioka  et  al's 
experiments for channel flows [11]. The location of the "shoulder" is about the same as that for 
maxK . According to 

 

2

the present theory, this "shoulder" may then be intricately related to the distribution of energy gradient. The solution of 
traveling waves has been confirmed by experiments recently [13].

CRITICAL REYNOLDS NUMBER OF THE ANNULUS 
 
         As  we  know  from  energy  gradient  theory,  the  dominating  parameter  determining  the  critical  condition  for 
 at  subcritical  condition  for  wall 
instability  is 
cK  for the 
bounded parallel flows (pressure driven flows) is a consistent quantity of 
0u ,  U,  and  Re  can  be  calculated  for  any  radius  ratio  of  the 
subcritical  transition  condition,  the  critical  values  of 
annulus.  As  long  as  the  values  of  these  parameters  are  below  the  critical  values,  the  flow  in  the  annulus  can  be 
maintained  as  a  laminar  flow  regardless  of  the  level  of  disturbance.  Obviously,  this  observation  has  significant 
implications in engineering.

 can  be  found  from  Eq.(12)  (see  Fig.2).  Thus  the  critical 
         At  the  critical  condition,  given  as  Kc=385,  and  max
values of Q, U and Re versus the radius ratio can be obtained. The critical flow rate and critical Reynolds number are 
shown in Fig.3 and Fig.4 respectively. It is found that the critical value of the Re increases with the radius ratio (k) of 
the annulus when the ratio k is larger than a value of 0.08. Below k=0.08, the critical value of the Re is less than that of 
the Poiseuille flow of circular pipe. Therefore, we can say that the inner cylinder initiates instability for k<0.08 and 
enhance  stability  for  k>0.08.  Similarly,  the  critical  value  of  the  Q  increases  with  the  radius  ratio  (k)  of  the  annulus 
when  the  ratio  k  is  larger  than  a  value  of  0.10.  Below  k=0.10,  the  critical  value  of  the  Q  is  less  than  that  of  the 
Poiseuille flow of circular pipe. The implication is that we can change the critical value of Re by inserting an inner 
cylinder at the center of a pipe and thus control the occurrence of turbulence. In this way, turbulence flow in a pipe can 
be caused to relaminarise in an annulus. This change may increase the averaged velocity in the passage, but the drag 
force is not increased significantly if k is small. This is because the friction coefficient for laminar flow is lower than 
that  for  a  turbulent  flow.    As  above  discussed,  the  radius  ratio  of  the  inner  to  the  outer  cylinders  has  important 
influence  on  the  subcritical  condition  of  transition  to  turbulence.  This  finding  can  be  applied  to  many  industrial 
processes and fluid transportations. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
    
         The critical condition for the instability of full-developed flow in an annulus is given. The criterion is based on 
the energy gradient theory for parallel flow instability.  The critical flow rate and critical Reynolds number increase 
with the radius ratio for large radius ratio annulus, but there is a tuning point in the range of very small radius ratio of 
about k<0.1. It is clear that inner cylinder creates instability for k<0.1; and enhance stability for k>0.1. Following this 
principle, the flow transition can be controlled by changing the radius ratio for a given outer radius. The idea can be 
employed in the design of fluid flow devices to control the flow status like drag reduction (by keeping to laminar flow) 
or increase the mixing of the fluid media (by changing to turbulent flow).

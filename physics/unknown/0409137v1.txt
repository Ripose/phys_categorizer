Abstract— The OPERA neutrino oscillation experiment foresees
the construction of two magnetized iron spectrometers located
after the lead-nuclear emulsion targets. The magnet is made
up of two vertical walls of rectangular cross section connected
by return yokes. The particle trajectories are measured by
high precision drift tubes located before and after the arms of
the magnet. Moreover, the magnet steel
is instrumented with
Resistive Plate Chambers that ease pattern recognition and allow
a calorimetric measurement of the hadronic showers. In this paper
we review the construction of the spectrometers. In particular, we
describe the results obtained from the magnet and RPC prototypes
and the installation of the ﬁnal apparatus at the Gran Sasso
laboratories. We discuss the mechanical and magnetic properties
of the steel and the techniques employed to calibrate the ﬁeld in
the bulk of the magnet. Moreover, results of the tests and issues
concerning the mass production of the Resistive Plate Chambers
are reported. Finally, the expected physics performance of the
detector is described; estimates rely on numerical simulations and
the outcome of the tests described above.

O PERA is a long-baseline neutrino experiment currently

under construction at the Gran Sasso underground lab-

oratories (LNGS) [1]. Its aim is the observation of (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:3)
(cid:0)(cid:6)(cid:5) oscillations in the parameter region indicated by Super-
Kamiokande [2] through direct observation of (cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:5)
charged
current interactions. The detector design is based on a massive
lead/nuclear emulsion target (ECC) complemented by elec-
tronic detectors (scintillator bars) that allow the location of the
event and drive the scanning of the emulsions. This instru-
mented target is followed by a magnetic spectrometer which
measures charge and momentum of penetrating tracks. The
instrumented target and the spectrometer constitutes one “su-
permodule”. OPERA is made up of two supermodules located
in the Hall C of LNGS (see Fig. 1). The magnets contribute
to the kinematic reconstruction of the event performed by the
ECC and the scintillators and suppress the background coming

from charm production through the identiﬁcation of secondary
antimuons.

The magnet (Fig. 2) is made up of two vertical walls of
rectangular cross section and of top and bottom ﬂux return path.
The walls are built lining twelve iron layers (5 cm thickness)
interleaved with 2 cm of air gap, allocated for the housing
of the active detectors (Resistive Plate Chambers, RPC). Each
iron layer is made up of seven slabs (cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:11)(cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:15)(cid:14)(cid:2)(cid:7)(cid:2)(cid:8)(cid:16)(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:17)(cid:19)(cid:14)(cid:9)(cid:8)(cid:20)(cid:8) mm (cid:21) .
These slabs are precisely milled along the two 1250 mm
long sides connected to the return yokes to minimize air gaps
along the magnetic circuit. The slabs are bolted together to
increase the compactness and the mechanical stability of the
magnet which, hence, can act as a base for the emulsion target
supports. The nuts holding the bolts also serve as spacers
between the slabs and ﬁx the 20 mm air gap where the RPC
are mounted. The slabs are bolted at the top and bottom edges
to the return ﬂux paths. The return yokes consist of six steel
substructures (1250 mm width) and two additional 625 mm
blocks (see Fig. 2). The bolts and the nuts prevent sliding of
the slabs making the multilayer wall, together with the return
path, a compact self-supporting structure. Moreover, this design
permits us to assemble the magnet in a fast and neat way: after
the positioning of the bottom return yokes and the lower coil,
the installation proceeds by mounting alternately the iron layers
and the inner tracker planes starting from the two innermost
iron/RPC layers. Once the two outermost layers are positioned,

bottom return yokes (Sep. 2003).

The construction of OPERA started in March 2003. The
installation of the bottom return yokes and coils has been
carried out (Fig. 4). Mounting of the vertical slabs started in
November 2003, while the completion of the ﬁrst spectrometer
and the magnetization of the steel for cosmic ray runs is planned
for summer 2004.

II. IRON PROPERTIES

The magnet is the basic support structure of OPERA. During
the mounting of the walls the mechanical structure of the
spectrometers undergoes signiﬁcant stresses. Moreover, after
the completion of the installation, the magnet is sensitive to
the weight of the ECC target, the magnetic forces and possible
seismic stresses. Hence, severe requirements have been applied
to the mechanical properties of the steel, especially for what
concerns its breaking strength, elongation and yield strength.
On the other hand, the steel must be appropriate for magnetic
applications (high magnetic permeability) in order to achieve
the nominal ﬁeld for deﬂection of charged particles. A S235 JR
steel (unalloyed steel for magnetic application) in compliance
with UNI EN 10025 has been chosen. In addition, upper
limits on the weight fractions for Carbon, Phosphorus and
Sulphur have been speciﬁed. The weight fraction of Manganese
affects signiﬁcantly the mechanical properties of the steel.
Hence, an higher fraction of Mn has been allowed for the slab
steel. It results, however, in a deterioration of the magnetic
properties (see below). On the other hand, looser mechanical
requirements apply on the return yokes and a signiﬁcantly
lower weight fraction of C and Mn could be allowed. Boron
contamination is kept below 5 ppm. The slabs have been
produced by DUFERCO (Clabecq, Belgium). Machining has
been carried out by MELONI (Tivoli, Italy). The return yokes
have been produced and machined by FOMAS (Osnago, Italy).
The chemical analysis is done by the steel producers for
each production batch. Moreover, the magnetic properties of

losses are neglected).

the structure is completed and stabilized by the installation of
the upper return yoke. The overall weight of the magnet is
990 ton. It is magnetized by means of two coils, 20 turns each,
installed in the top and bottom ﬂux return path. The nominal
current ﬂowing in the coils is 1600 A, corresponding to an
overall magnetomotive force of 64000 A (cid:7) turns. The average
ﬁeld expected along the walls is 1.57 T with an uniformity
along the height better than 5%.

The particle trajectories are measured by layers of vertical
drift tube planes located before and after the walls (Fig. 3).
Left-right ambiguities are resolved by the two-dimensional
measurements of the spectrometer RPC and additional RPC
located between the ECC target and the ﬁrst magnet wall with
(cid:8) 45 (cid:9) orientation pickup strips (“XPC”)1. Moreover, the RPC
allow a coarse tracking inside the magnet to identify muons,
perform pattern recognition and ease track matching between
the precision trackers [6]. They also provide a measurement of
the tail of the hadronic energy leaking from the target and of
the range of muons which stop in the iron.

the steel produced for the iron walls and return yokes are
checked in a direct manner: small toroidal samples have been
prepared for each batch; hysteresis curves have been drawn
for every sample at different maximum values of
and the
corresponding coercivity has been determined. A systematic
difference between the properties of the steel used for the
vertical slabs and the one used to construct the prototype of
the spectrometer [7] has been observed. It has been traced
back to the higher Manganese fraction allowed to achieve the
mechanical speciﬁcations. The relative magnetic permeabilities
(
) are shown in Fig. 5 (lower plot) together with
the
curves (upper plot) for the prototype steel (full
dots) and one batch of slab steel (empty dots). We expect a
difference in the magnetic ﬁeld
of about 3% at the nominal
magnetomotive force.

III. MONITOR OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD

The absolute measurement of the magnetic ﬂux

is based
on the voltage induced in a set of pickup coils during the ramp-
up (ramp-down) of the power supply (“ballistic measurement”).
The variation of the current ﬂowing in the driving coils induces
a change in the magnetic ﬂux cut by the pickup coil; the induced
voltage is

at the nominal current averaged on the coil

along the height of each magnet wall. These coils average
the magnetic ﬂux of all the 12 layers. The presence of layers
with anomalous reluctances (air gaps at the connection with
the return yokes) can be measured by additional (“internal”)
coils inserted parallel to the RPC at about half the height of
the magnet. The coils will be made up of 32-wire ﬂat cables
connected through a passive board. The board allows to vary
the number of turns forming the coil and includes a low-pass
ﬁlter. The two ends of the coil are sent to the integrator. The
induced voltage depends on

However, the shape of the function
is driven by the
strong nonlinear behavior of ferromagnetic materials and by
the magnetic skin effect [8]. The maximum voltage during the

The monitoring system has been validated in a full-height
prototype built in Frascati in 2001 [7] . The results are shown
in Fig. 6 and are compared with the expectation from ﬁnite-
element simulation based on the TOSCA [9] code. Similarly,
tests of uniformity of the ﬁeld have been carried out by means
of mobile coils. The main sources of error are related with
the integration of
. In particular, baseline ﬂuctuations and
environmental background represent a non negligible contribu-
tion since the integration is performed for time intervals of the
order of several tenths of seconds. For the present setup, they
correspond to an uncertainty of (cid:8)
T in the magnetic ﬁeld.
Systematics have been investigated performing measurements
with different
(“empty measure-
ments” for signal to noise evaluation). No signiﬁcant biases
were found. On the other hand, a systematic bias of about 4%
is observed with respect to simulation. This is mainly due to the
difference of magnetic properties of the steel after machining
compared with the nominal sample. Moreover, additional air
gaps coming from the non-ideal mechanical contacts between
the slabs and the return yokes contribute to the observed deﬁcit.
The pick-up coils can be used only during the ramp-up of
the current. Relative variations of the ﬁeld can be monitored
indirectly by the power-supply current monitors. However,
additional information will be provided by a set of Hall probes
glued to the RPC, which measure the fringe ﬁeld in the 2 cm
air gap. These data will be used to validate the simulation and
to monitor possible long term drifts of the ﬁeld. Similarly, Hall
probes will monitor the fringe ﬁeld in air outside the magnet,
particularly in the region where the phototubes reading the
scintillator bars are located.

IV. RESISTIVE PLATE CHAMBERS

7I

(cid:1)(cid:0)

(cid:1)(cid:0)(cid:2)(cid:0)

In the 2 cm thick gaps between the iron slabs, a layer
of Resistive Plate Chambers [10] will be positioned. The
area of the magnet is covered by 21 chambers.
8.2 (cid:10) 8.75 m
The dimensions of the chambers are 2.91 (cid:10) 1.14 m
but four
different chamber types have been designed; they are shaped
to optimize the sensitive area accounting for the presence
of the bolts. The plates that act as electrodes are made of
2 mm thick high-pressure plastic laminate (Bakelite), with
a volume resistivity of (cid:7)
-cm. Their external
surface is painted with graphite of high surface resistivity ( 100
/square) connected to the HV distribution system and cov-
k (cid:3)
ered by two 190
m insulating ﬁlms. The inner surface of the
Bakelite planes is treated with linseed oil, which signiﬁcantly
improves the smoothness of the electrodes. Planarity of the
two electrodes is assured by polycarbonate spacers (LEXAN)
located on a 10 cm-square grid in the sensitive volume. The
active area is ﬁlled with an argon-based gas mixture (Argon
75.5%, TFE 20%, isobutane 4%, SF (cid:4) 0.5%) at atmospheric
pressure. The 2-dim position measurements are provided by
two orthogonal layers of copper strips. These pickup strips are
not interrupted in the vicinity of the bolts but surround the dead
zone as shown in Fig. 7. The chambers operate in streamer
mode at a working voltage of 5.85 kV. The induced charge at
the strips is of order of 100 pC, and the pulse has a rise time of
2 ns and a duration of 10 ns. Results of the prototype tests are
reported elsewhere [11]. The mass production of the detectors
started in Jan 2003 and the RPC for the ﬁrst spectrometer have
been produced. Several validation tests are in progress [12]:

(cid:5) Test of gas tightness at the production site.

C(cid:12)

(cid:5) Mechanical tests.
(cid:5) Electrical tests.
(cid:5) Efﬁciency measurements with cosmic muons.
The mechanical tests have been fully automatized. First of
all a leakage test is carried out. The detectors are inﬂated
at 6 mbar and temporal variations of pressure are monitored.
Chambers that exhibit a leakage rate larger than (cid:7)(cid:9)(cid:8)
bar/min are
rejected. Afterward, a mobile bridge housing a set of pistons
(Fig. 8) is moved in the proximity of the LEXAN spacers.
The pistons are lowered in order to exert pressure onto the
upper RPC surface. An abnormal variation of pressure indicates
the presence of unglued spacers. A further test determines the
exact position of the defective buttons. The fraction of accepted
RPC after the test is about 90%. The electrical tests have been
designed to measure the current-voltage characteristics in pure
argon, the current-voltage characteristics in gas mixture and
the short term behavior of the RPC at voltage. The facility
developed in 2003 allows to test 48 RPC simultaneously. The
current-voltage characteristics in argon allows to check the
cleanliness of the internal surface of the gap and to measure
the average resistivity of the two electrodes. The chambers are
characterized by their current derivative
, their primer
voltage at ﬁxed currents (I=100 nA and 500 nA) and their
current at nominal operating voltage. Finally, a short term test
is performed (for minimum 24 hours up to few days). The
RPC are kept at ﬁxed voltage and the time stability of the
current is monitored. In particular, chambers with
in
Argon higher than 20 nA/kV or high currents ( (cid:9) 700 nA) at
the nominal operating voltage with the standard gas mixture are
rejected. The cosmic ray test [13] is carried out employing a test
facility built at the beginning of 2003. Two large planes of glass
RPC are used for triggering purpose. The RPC under tests are
placed inside boxes, (12 RPC/box), in vertical position and their
efﬁciency are computed selecting isolated cosmic muons. The
overall fraction of accepted RPC is (cid:10) 83%. The main source
of rejection is due to the poor gluing of the spacers: about
10% of the RPC fail the mechanical test. Failure at the electric
test contribute to 0.5%; poor ( (cid:11) 95%) or strongly non-uniform
efﬁciencies are observed in 6.5% of the RPC (failure of the
cosmic ray test).

V. EXPECTED PHYSICS PERFORMANCES

The tests results described in Sec. III and IV allowed a
realistic tuning of the full simulation for the OPERA muon
system. Due to their coarse granularity, the RPC play a minor
role in the determination of the momentum for particle crossing
the spectrometer. In this case, the curvature is measured by a
set of four Drift Tube (DT) chambers located as in Fig. 3.
Each chamber is made up of four DT planes with a staggered
geometry aimed at minimizing the dead zones. The drift time
resolution corresponds to an uncertainty in the drift radius of
about 0.5 mm. Conversely, the RPC contribute to the measure-
ment of the momentum from range for muons stopping in the

steel. The results in term of relative precision on (cid:12)

account the precision of the trackers (dominated by DT) and the
uncertainty due to Multiple Scattering. The error bars account
for the event statistics. The momentum resolution for stopping
muons (momentum from range) is shown in Fig. 10. The
charge misassignment probability for thoroughgoing muons in
the energy range of interest (2-20 GeV) is below 0.4%.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

The design and construction of the OPERA magnetic spec-
trometer poses unusual engineering problems, not often encoun-
tered in the development of muon systems. The spectrometer
acts both as a subdetector and as the main support structure for
the emulsion-lead target. Moreover, in a deep underground area,
ﬁeld monitoring and calibration cannot be accomplished by the
analysis of stopping cosmic muons and require a dedicated
system based on pickup coils and Hall probes. Finally, the

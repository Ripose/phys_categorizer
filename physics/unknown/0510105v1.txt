Abstract.  - A  theoretical  thermodynamic  cycle  more  efficient  than  an  infinite  set  of 

Carnot engines operating between the same temperature levels is presented. This result 

is unexpected from the point of view of classical thermodynamics. 

     Classical  thermodynamics  indicates that    the  most  efficient  thermodynamic  cycle 

operating    between  two  given  heat  reservoirs  is  the  Carnot  engine[1],  and  a  basic 

theorem expresses that any reversible cycle  working between two constant temperature

levels    should  have  the  same  efficiency  as  a  Carnot  cycle  [2].  A  corollary  of  this 

postulate  indicates  that  the  efficiency  of  any  irreversible  cycle  is  lower  than  that  of  a 

reversible  engine  operating  between  the  same  temperature  levels  [2].    Also,  any 

reversible cycle can be expressed as the limit of an infinite number of Carnot cycles [3]. 

     To evaluate the performance of any given thermodynamic cycle we may compare it 

with a Carnot engine operating between the same temperature levels, in view of the fact 

that  the  Carnot  engine  is  the  most  efficient  of  all  thermodynamic  cycles  working 

between  two  given  heat  reservoirs  [1].  If  the  temperature  levels  are  not  constant,  the 

comparison should be done with an equivalent thermodynamic engine composed of an 

infinite set of Carnot engines designed according to the temperature profile of the heat 

1

reservoirs of the cycle under study. The efficiency of any thermodynamic cycle with not 

constant  temperature  levels  should  be  equal  or  less  than  the  average  efficiency  of  an 

infinite set of Carnot cycles operating between the same heat reservoirs.

     In relation to this topic, the objective of this communication is to show the existence 

of  an  unusual thermodynamic  cycle  more  efficient  than  an  infinite  number  of  Carnot 

cycles operating between the same temperature levels.

     The proposed thermodynamic cycle consists of three reversible stages. The first step 

is an isothermal expansion, the second step is a cooling process at constant volume, and 

the third stage is an adiabatic compression

     To estimate the efficiency of this cycle let us assume that the working fluid consists 

of 1  mol  of  a  monatomic  ideal  enclosed in  a  cylinder equipped  with  a  piston  without 

friction. Initially, the ideal gas is at 800K and 4 bars. Then, from this initial condition 

the  gas  expands  reversibly  and  isothermally  from  4  to  1  bar. Next,  the  ideal  gas  is 

reversibly  cooled  at  constant  volume  until  it reaches  an  adiabatic  path  that  returns 

reversibly  the  ideal  gas  to  its  initial  state.  By  calculations,  the  temperature  at  the 

intersection of the constant volume step and the adiabatic path that returns the ideal gas 

to the initial condition is 317.48 K. 

     We can observe that during the reversible isothermal expansion the gas absorbs heat 

from the high temperature reservoir which is at a constant temperature of 800K. For this 

to  be  a  reversible  heat  transfer  the  temperature  of  the  working  fluid  must  be 

infinitesimally lower than the temperature of the hot reservoir. 

     Also,  the  cycle  rejects  heat  during  the  constant  volume  stage  to  a  low  temperature 

reservoir  whose  temperatures  varies  uniformly  and  reversibly  from  317.48  to  800K.

Since the rejection of heat throughout this stage is a reversible transition, then we must 

have  an  infinite  set  of  low  temperature  reservoirs  ranging  uniformly  from  317.48  to 

2

800K.  During this  process  the  temperature of  the  working substance  is  infinitesimally 

higher than the temperature of the low temperature reservoirs. 

     To  simplify  calculations,  the  cylinder  walls  and  the  piston  are  considered  of 

negligible heat  capacity  and do not  accumulate  energy or  entropy. Also,  potential and 

kinetic  energy  changes  are  neglected,  and  the  ideal  gas  and  the  heat  reservoirs  are 

assumed as closed systems.

     By  using  standard  thermodynamics  calculations  [1],  we  find that  throughout  the 

reversible isothermal expansion the ideal gas receives 9220.52 J of heat from the high 

temperature   reservoir at 800K and produces 9220.52 J of work. During the reversible 

constant volume step the ideal gas rejects 6017.51 J of heat to an infinite set of cold heat 

reservoirs whose temperatures varies uniformly from 317.48 K to 800K. Next, the ideal

gas  requires  6017.51  J  of  reversible  compression  work  to  return adiabatically  to  its

initial  state. From  these  calculations,  the  energy  supplied  to  the  proposed  cycle  is 

9220.52 J and the net work is 3203.01 J.  Then, the efficiency of the cycle, defined as 

the net work divided by the heat supplied is 0.35. 

     Also, the efficiency of the proposed cycle may be expressed in terms of the absolute 

temperatures by the following equation 

     η = 1 – [(Th- Tc)/ Ln (Th/Tc)] / Th                                                                           (1)

where Th is the temperature of the hot reservoir and Tc is the lowest temperature of the 

set of cold  reservoirs. In this case Th is 800K and Tc is 317.48K.

     Energy  and  entropy  balances  suggest  that  energy  is  conserved  and  that  the  total 

entropy  change  of  the  universe  is  equal  to  0  J/K.  Therefore,  above  cycle  meets  the 

general requirements of thermodynamic laws.

      Now, let us to compare the above thermodynamic cycle with an equivalent Carnot 

cycle  operating  between  the  same  temperature  levels.    As  we  can  detect,      the  hot 

3

reservoir of  the  proposed  cycle  is  at  a  constant  temperature  of    800  K,  but  the 

temperature of the cold  reservoir is not constant and varies uniformly from 317.48 K to 

800 K.  Then, the comparison should be done with an equivalent thermodynamic engine 

composed  of  an  infinite  set  of  Carnot  engines  designed  according  to  the  temperature 

profile  of  the  heat  reservoirs  of  the  cycle  under  study. Since,  we  know,  precisely, the 

temperature  levels  of  the  proposed  cycle,  we  can  construct  an  infinite  set  of  Carnot 

cycles operating  between  these  temperature  levels.  In  other  words,  let  us  assemble  an

infinite  set  of    parallel  Carnot  cycles  that  absorb  heat  from  the  high  temperature 

reservoir which is at a constant temperature of 800K and expel heat to an infinite set of 

low temperature reservoirs ranging uniformly from 317.48 K to 800K. As an example, 

the first Carnot cycle of the set receives a certain amount of heat from the hot reservoir 

at 800K, does work, and rejects some amount of heat to the cold reservoir at 317.48 K. 

The second Carnot cycle of the set absorbs some heat from the hot reservoir at 800K, 

produces work and discards some heat to the cold reservoir at 317. 49 K, for instance. 

The  third  Carnot  cycle  of  the  set  takes  heat  from  the  hot  reservoir  at  800K,  performs 

work  and  expels  heat  to  the  cold  reservoir  at  317.50  K.  And  so  on,    we  assemble  an 

infinite  number  of  Carnot  cycles  to  cover  the  whole  range  of  the  cold  temperature 

reservoirs ranging  uniformly from 317.48 K to  800K. Since we know the temperature 

levels  of  the  infinite  number  of    Carnot  cycles,  then  we  can  estimate  the  average 

efficiency of  this set by the following method.

      The average efficiency of this infinite set of parallel   Carnot cyles,  η av ,  is equal to 

the net work of the set of  Carnot cycles,  Wnet, , divided by the total heat absorbed by 

the set of Carnot cycles, Qh .

where

     η av  =  Wnet / Qh                                                                                                                                                                  (2)

and                   

     Q h   =    Q h1  + Q h2  +  ……………..+  Q hi                                                                                                           (4)                                                      

     Here,  W1 ,   W2 ,…………….., Wi        represent the net work    of    each  Carnot cycle of 

the set,   and  Q  h1  ,   Q  h2  ,…..  ,   Q  hi         are the heat  absorbed from the high temperature 

reservoir  by each Carnot  cycle of the set  . The sub index   i varies from 1 to n and n 

symbolize the number of Carnot cycles which tends to infinite.                        

     Now,  the efficiency of  the ith  Carnot cycle of the set , ηi ,  is 

     ηi   =  Wi /  Q hi  =   (1 -  Tci / Th)                                                                                (5)

where Th  is the temperature  of the hot reservoir of each Carnot cycle which is the same

for all of the cycles  of the set and equal to 800 K , and  Tci is the temperature of the cold 

reservoir of each Carnot cycle of the set that varies between 317.48 and 800K.

     Then, the work of each Carnot cycle is 

     Wi  ==   (1 -  Tci / Th) Q hi                                                                                                                                      (6)

     Subsequently, the net work of the infinite set of Carnot cycles is

     Wnet =  (1- Tc1 / Th) Q h1   +    (1- Tc2 / Th) Q h2  + …....     + (1 -  Tci / Th) Q hi                       (7)

where  Tc1, Tc2,    …  ,  Tci    are  the    temperatures  of    the  cold    reservoirs  of  each  Carnot 

cycle..

     By substituting eq.(7) into eq.(2) , the average efficiency of the infinite set of Carnot 

cycles is                                                                                                          

    η av = (1- Tc1 / Th) Q h1/Q h   +   (1- Tc2 / Th) Q h2/ Q h+….. + (1 -  Tci / Th)Q hi/Q h        (8)

     In order to estimate the average efficiency from eq.(8), it is necessary to evaluate  the 

terms  Q  h1/Q  h  ,    Q  h2/ Q  h    , Q  hi/Q  h    ,  which  represent how  the  total  heat  input  is 

distributed among  the infinite number of  parallel Carnot cycles.    

5

    Q h1/Q h      =    Q h2/Q h      =     Q hi/Q h    = 1 / n                                                         (9)                                                         

     Since the  efficiency of each  parallel Carnot cycle of the set  only depends  on the 

temperature levels of the hot and cold reservoirs, then, whatever the choice of heat input

we use, the efficiency of each Carnot cycle will be the same. As an extension [4], once 

the temperature profile of the infinite set of Carnot cycles is defined, the efficiency of 

the set is fixed, no matter what heat input distribution we use, because such efficiency 

only depends on the temperature levels of the hot and cold reservoirs. In other words, all 

Carnot engines operating between the same temperature levels are equivalent and have 

the same efficiency [2], independent of the heat input distribution.

    According to this idea, to simplify calculations, let us assume that each Carnot cycle 

of the set receives the same amount of heat from the hot reservoir. Then

where n is the number of Carnot cycles,  and n tends to infinite.

     Introducing eq. (9) into eq. (8)  we obtain

     η av =     [(1- Tc1 / Th)   +   (1- Tc2 / Th) +….. (1 -  Tci / Th)] / n                                  (10)

     To  estimate  this  average  we  may  use  a  mathematical  procedure,        similar  to  one 

described in     ref.[ 5], obtaining the limit of eq. (10) when n tends to infinite. Indeed, 

this is the procedure to get the mean value of any mathematical function.

     η av =   

lim   [(1- Tc1 / Th)   +   (1- Tc2 / Th) +….. (1 -  Tci / Th)] / n                            (10)

    η av =

     To determine this limit let us divide the temperature interval of the cold reservoir in   

infinite  small  subintervals,  ∆  Tc.  We  may  define  equal  or  non  equal  spaced  intervals 

and the result will be the same when  n  tends to infinite. For simplicity, we may define 

6

n  equally spaced intervals   ∆ Tc.  , as small as possible. When n tends to infinite, the 

intervals become infinitesimally small.

   ∆ Tc= ( Tcb – Tca ) / n                                                                                             (12)

where Tca is the lowest temperature  of the cold reservoir equal to 317.48 K and Tcb is 

the highest temperature of the cold reservoir equal to 800K.                                                                           

     Substituting eq.(12) into  eq.(11) we get

     η av =  [1 / (Tcb – Tca)]     

( 1 -  Tci / Th)   ∆ Tc                                      (13)

     From the general concept of integration [5], this limit coincides with the integral of 

the following expression

     η av =    1 – [(Tcb + Tca)  / 2 Th ]                                                                               (15)

     Then, the average efficiency for the infinite set of Carnot cycles is

     η av =    0.30                                                                                                                (16)

      Evaluating eq. (10)  by an alternative procedure  [6], using the limit  of a series, the 

same result is obtained for the average efficiency.

     In conclusion, we observe that the efficiency of the proposed cycle is greater than the 

average  efficiency  of  an  infinite  set  of  Carnot  cycles  operating  between  the  same 

temperature  levels.  This  result  is  unexpected  from  the  point  of  view  of  classical 

thermodynamics  which  suggests  that  the  efficiency  of  any  thermodynamic  cycle  with 

not constant temperature levels should be equal or less than the average efficiency of an 

infinite set of Carnot cycles operating between the same heat reservoirs.

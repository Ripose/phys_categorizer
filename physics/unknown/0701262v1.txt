We study gray solitons in nonlocal nonlinear media and show that they are stable and 

can form bound states. We reveal that gray soliton velocity depends on the nonlocality 

degree,  and  that  it  can  be  drastically  reduced  in  highly  nonlocal  media.  This  is  in 

contrast to the case of local media, where the maximal velocity is dictated solely by the 

asymptotic soliton amplitude.

Nonlocality  is  ubiquitous  in  several  nonlinear  optical  materials,  such  as  nematic 

liquid  crystals,  thermo-optical  materials,  plasmas,  and  photorefractive  crystals.  It  has 

been  shown  to  profoundly  affect  beam  interactions  [1].  Thus,  interaction  between  one-

dimensional bright solitons in nonlocal media depends on spatial separation [2,3] so that 

bound states of bright solitons may form [4-6]. Nonlocal materials sustain complex two-

dimensional  solitons  [7-16],  while  dark  solitons  may  exist  in  defocusing  nonlocal  media. 

Strongly nonlocal response can cause attraction between two dark solitons [17,18] which 

always  repel  each  other  in  local  medium.  A  characteristic  signature  of  dark  solitons  in 

nonlocal media is the presence of non-monotonic tails affording the formation of bound 

states [17]. 

Dark solitons, however, are a particular type of gray solitons having antisymmetric 

phase profiles, but with a smaller and more gradual phase shift [19]. Gray solitons move 

in  the  transverse  plane  upon  propagation,  with  a  grayness  that  depends  on  the  soliton 

velocity.  In  this  Letter  we  introduce  properties  of  gray  solitons  in  nonlocal  nonlinear 

media. We show that nonlocal gray solitons are stable and can form bound states. We 

discover that nonlocality imposes drastic restrictions on gray soliton velocity.

Our  theoretical  model  is  based  on  two  coupled  equations  for  the  light  field 

amplitude q  and nonlinear contribution to refractive index n  describing the propagation 

of laser beam along the  ξ  axis of a nonlocal defocusing medium:

  and  ξ   stand  for  the  transverse  and  longitudinal  coordinates  scaled  to  the 

characteristic width of the dark notch of the soliton profile and to the diffraction length, 

respectively.  When  nonlocality  parameter

  one  recovers  the  local  case,  while

  corresponds  to  a  strong  nonlocality.  The  nonlinear  contribution  to  refractive

is the response function of the nonlocal medium. Defocusing nonlocal nonlinearities that 

allow  formation  of  dark  and  gray  solitons  are  encountered  in  various  physical  systems, 

including  atomic  vapors,  weakly  absorbing  liquids  [18],  and  liquid  crystals  featuring  a 

thermal response [20]. While the details of the response function may be different in each 

case, the model (1) is expected to capture the general physics of nonlocal gray solitons. 

Note that Eq. (1) can be simplified in the limiting cases of strong and weak nonlocality. 

Thus,  at  d

  the  equation  for  n   can  be  solved  at  the  first  order  of  perturbation 

theory to give

, a result that allows obtaining corrections to the 

parameters of local gray solitons in analytic form [19]. At  d

 one can use the fact 

that  the  response  function  width  is  much  larger  than  the  dark  soliton  notch  width  to 

simplify the expression for  n  and to obtain a simple equation for q  by using expansions 

for

The  nonlocality  drastically  affects  gray  soliton  properties.  Representative  examples  of 

intensity profiles

 of single gray solitons are depicted in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). 

The  asymptotic  intensity  and  refractive  indices  for  nonlocal  gray  solitons  at  η

→ ±∞

 

coincide with those in local media. The soliton grayness 

g =

min

q

 (minimal intensity

value)  monotonically  increases  with  α ,  but  in  contrast  to  gray  solitons  in  local  media 

that  feature  smooth  shapes,  rapidly  moving  nonlocal  gray  solitons  develop  multiple 

intensity  oscillations  around  the  main  intensity  deep  (Fig.  1(b)).  These  oscillations 

become more pronounced for high nonlocality degrees. They exist even at 

α →

0

, though 

the  number  of  oscillations  increases  while  their  amplitude  decreases  with  α .  The 

transverse  phase  distributions  (Fig.  2)  confirm  that  solitons  from  Figs.  1(a)  and  1(b) 

correspond to single gray solitons. The development of shape oscillations is accompanied 

by divergence of 

rU

 which turns out to be a nonmonotonic function of  α  (Fig. 3(a)), in 

contrast  to  the  case  of  local  media  where  energy  U

= − −
2(

b

r

α

2 1/ 2
)

  monotonically 

decreases  with  α   and  vanishes  at 

α

→ − =
b

1

.  At 

α =

0

  and 

d >

0

  the  rescaled 

energy 

rU

  exceeds  the  value 

2(

)b−

  of  energy  in  local  media  because  nonlocality 

1/ 2

generates oscillations even on dark solitons. 

There  is  a  maximal  soliton  velocity, 

,  at  which  the  gray  soliton  vanishes 

mα

completely,  since 

g α
(

α→

)

=

1

.  The  maximal  soliton  velocity  in  nonlocal  media  is 

m

lower than that in local media (Fig. 3(b)). Therefore, nonlocality of nonlinear response 

strongly affects the mobility of gray solitons. Figure 4(a) show how the maximal soliton 

velocity decreases with d . The soliton grayness is a monotonically increasing function of 

 

 

 

 

3

the nonlocality degree for a fixed velocity  α , and it tends to unity when d  approaches a 

certain limiting value (Fig. 4(b)). Notice that in contrast to 

, the rescaled momentum 

rU

  is  a  monotonically  increasing  function  of 

rP
theory for gray solitons [19] might be considered as an indication of soliton stability. 

,  which  in  accordance  with  stability 

α

We found that solitons exhibit qualitatively similar properties for all values of b , 

i.e.  for  each  b   there  exist  maximal  velocity  that  monotonically  decreases  with  d . 

Increasing  b  results in a monotonic increase of the maximal possible soliton velocity at 

fixed d . Thus, at 

d =

5

 the maximal velocity is 

α =
m

0.631

 for 

b = −
1

, while one gets 

α =
m

0.758

 for 

b = −
2

, and 

α =
m

0.913

 for 

b = −
4

. Therefore, in nonlocal media the 

maximal velocity increases with 

b  slower than in local media, where 

α = −

To  study  gray  soliton  stability  we  performed  simulations  of  Eqs.  (1)  with  input

 is a broadband noise. Since we used a 

split-step  Fourier  method  in  simulations,  we  employed  combinations  of  two  identical 

solitons  with  opposite  signs  of 

u

  separated  by  a  huge  distance.  We  found  that  single 

gray  solitons  are  stable,  including  slowly  moving  almost  dark  solitons  and  solitons 

moving  with  velocities  close  to 

  and  featuring  multiple  oscillations  (Figs.  5(a)  and 

mα

5(b)). We studied the propagation of gray solitons nested on a wide Gaussian envelope, 

which  does  not  qualitatively  affect  soliton  dynamics.  Only  when,  after  a  long-distance 

propagation, the moving gray soliton reaches the region where the background intensity 

of  the  host  beam  starts  to  decrease  slowly,  the  soliton  slightly  accelerates,  similarly  to 

gray soliton propagating on finite background in local nonlinear media [19,21,22]. 

 

The presence of nonmonotonic tails in single gray solitons suggest the possibility 

to  form  bound  states  of  several  gray  solitons  moving  with  the  same  velocity.  The 

simplest bound state of two gray solitons is shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). Its intensity 

distribution  possesses  local  maximum  in  between  two  gray  solitons  forming  the  bound 

state, while the refractive index profile has a shape of a waveguide which is capable to 

keep the complex gray solitons together. A multiple intensity oscillations develop in the 

profile of the bound states when their velocity approaches the maximal value 

mα

, which 

is almost equal to that for single solitons; it also rapidly decreases with d . In contrast to 

single  solitons,  for  bound  states  the  rescaled  energy 

  is  a  monotonically  increasing 

rU

function  of 

α

.  When 

α

α→

  the  energy  flow 

  diverges.  Calculations  suggest  that 

rU

m

stable  extended  trains  of  gray  solitons  are  possible.  Numerical  simulations  for  bound 

 

4

states  of  two  and  three  gray  solitons  showed  that  such  states  are  completely  stable  at 

small and moderate velocities  α  (Figs. 5(c) and 5(d)), but may exhibit weak instabilities 

when 

α

α→

. m

 

We thus conclude by stressing that a nonlocal nonlinearity drastically affect the 

profiles, velocities, and interactions between gray solitons. Particularly important is the 

finding of a maximum possible soliton velocity in nonlocal media that decreases fast with 

high  nonlocality.  Our  findings  suggest  a  feasible  way  to  steer  gray  soliton  light  beams, 

by tuning the strength of nonlocality in different nonlinear media.

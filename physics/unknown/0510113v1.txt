Abstract.  After  having  shown  that  the  corresponding  components  of  a  four  vector 
transform via the same transformation factors as the space-time coordinates of the same 
event do, we design a relativistic diagram that displays in true values theirs components. 
One diagram works for events generated by tardyons whereas a second diagram works 
for  events  generated  by  light  signals  or  photons.  We  consider  both  approaching  and 
receding  tardyons  respectively  photons  in  each  case.  We  also  show  how  the  relativistic

Consider a four vector4,5,  whose vector component is

the  four  vector  associated  with  the  receding  tardyon  and  with  the  events  it 
generates transform as the space-time coordinates do i.e.:

  could 
 
have?  The  answer  is  that 
  are  the  vector  components  of  the  four 
position  vector,    four  velocity,    four  acceleration,  tardyon  four  momentum, 
four force,  four current  electromagnetic four potential as detected from K 
and K’ respectively. Consequently 
 could be the scalar components of 
the  four  vectors  mentioned  above  including  the  mass  and  energy  of  a 
tardyon and the electric charge density. 
 
 
1.2.  Constructing  the  relativistic  diagram  that  displays  in  true 
values  the  components  of  a  four  vector  associated  with  a  tardyon  as 
detected from two inertial reference frames in relative motion 
 
The  axes  of  the  relativistic  diagram  we  propose  are  perpendicular  to 
each  other  and  on  them  we  measure  (in  our  two-dimensional  approach) 
 
having its centre at the origin O of the diagram (as shown in Figure 2) where 

At this point we ask our self what significance

also displays in true values the magnitude and the projections of the vector components 
of four vectors that transform as the space coordinates of the events mentioned above do. 
 
On the same diagram we draw curve (11). The invariance of the OY(O’Y’) 
components enables us to find out the correspondence between the locations 
of  the  end  points  for  the  vectors    R  and  R’  as  shown  in  Figure  2.  The 
diagram displays in true values the angles 
 which the two vectors 
make  with  the  positive  direction  of  the  common  axes.  The  diagram  also 
depicts  at  the  same  scale  the  following:  the  circle  of  radius  R’,  the 
magnitude of R and the components of the two vectors obtained by dropping 
perpendiculars on the corresponding axes. 
 
The second relativistic diagram we propose (presented in Figure 3) displays 
  that  equals  the  magnitude  of  the  scalar  component  of 
a  circle  of  radius 
the  four  vector  as  measured  in  K’  and  the  curve  (13), 
  representing  its 
magnitude  measured  from  K.  A  straight  line  starting  at  the  origin  of  the 
diagram O intersects the circle at point 1’ and the curve (13) at point 1.

profile8,9,10 
The  radar  detection  is  similar  to  the  hunting  with  laser  guns.  If  the 
 
radar detected profile is a circle at rest in K’ then (as we have seen above) 
when  we  detect  it  from  K  its  radar  detected  shape  will  be  an  ellipse.  This 
ellipse  has  its  left  focal  point  at  the  origin  O  of  the  diagram  when  the 
detected profile is “receding”, respectively its right focal point at O when the 
profile is “approaching” the observer O. 
The photographic detection is similar to the simultaneous detection of 
 
light  signals  that  have  left  a  luminous  profile  at  the  different  points  and  at 
different times. The time when the simultaneous detection takes place is the 
 open the photo cameras they handle or 
time when our observers 
their  eyes.  If  the  photographed  luminous  object  is  a  circle  at  rest  in  K’ 
located at its origin O’ then its photographed shape will be an ellipse. This 
ellipse  has  its  right  focal  point  at  the  origin  O’  of  the  diagram  when  the 
luminous  circle  is  approaching  the  observer
,  respectively  the  ellipse  has 
its left focal point at the origin of the diagram when the circle is receding the 
observer
 
The  results  obtained  so  far  tell  us  that  the  radar  detected  shape  of  a 
circle at rest in K’ and having its centre at O’ is an ellipse (13) having its left 
focal point at O’ as well. They also tell us that the photographed shape of the 
same circle is an ellipse (31) having its right focal point at O’ as well.

detected shape by:

parallel  to  the  common  axes  OX(O’X’),  at  rest  in  K’  where  observers 
measure its proper length 
. In Figures 8 and 9 we present the way in which 
the  space-time  diagrams  enable  us  to  measure  its  length  from  K  using  the 
radar  and  the  photographic  detection  respectively.  In  both  cases  we  have 
considered  the  situations  when  both  ends  of  the  rod  are  “receding”  or 
 In both 
“approaching” from the perspective of the stationary observer 
cases a length contraction or length dilation could take place or even we can 
detect (using and adequate location of the rod in its rest frame) the Lorentz 
contraction. An analytic approach is presented in 11.

3.3 Einstein’s mirror12 
 
 
There are situations in which we should use both space-time diagrams 
(for  incoming  and  outgoing  light  rays)  at  the  same  time.  Consider  a  plane 
mirror at rest in K’ and confined to the X’O’Z’ plane. An incident ray makes 
 with the normal to the mirror and it is reflected along a direction 
an angle 
that makes the same angle with the normal as shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10. Illustrating the way in which observers from K detect the reflection of light on 
a vertical mirror at rest in K. 
 
On  the  same  figure  we  present  a  circle  of  radius 
  (the  frequency  of  the 
incident  and  the  reflected  rays  as  measured  in  K’)  at  a  given  well-defined 
scale  and  the  two  space-time  diagrams  presented  above.  The  reflection  is 
considered on the right surface of the mirror.  
Let 1’ and 2’ be two events detected from K’ which take place on the 
 
circle,  the  first  on  the  incident  ray  the  second  on  the  reflected  one. 
According  to  the  handling  rules  of  the  diagram,  when  detected  from  K  the 
event 1’ takes place on the ellipse corresponding to the incoming ray at point 
1. Event 2’ detected from K takes place at point 2 located on the ellipse that 
corresponds to the outgoing rays. The incidence point O that coincides with 
the  origin  of  our  space-time  diagrams  is  the  same  in  all  inertial  reference 
frames.  Knowing the location of the points 1 and 2 we can draw the incident 
and the reflected rays as detected from K; the first ray makes an angle i the 
second an angle r with the normal to the mirror as detected from K’. All the 
angles are displayed in true values.

Analyzing figures 2 and 3 we see that the basic curves of our space-

 
 
time diagrams have two common points, determined by theirs intersection. 
 First  consider  the  case  of  the  four  vectors  associated  with  tardyons. 
 
Figure  2  accounts  for  the  vector  component  of  the  four  vector  whereas 
Figure  3  accounts  for  its  scalar  component.  In  the  case  of  the  vector 
when detected from K, and 
 and 
component the two points are 
respectively 
  when  detected 
from K’. The particular direction 
 is characterized by the fact that along it 
observers  from  K  do  not  detect  relativistic  effects  associated  with  the 
magnitude  of  R  and  R’.  Imposing  the  condition  R=R’  (4)  leads  to  the 
following value for the angle

We  can  do  the  same  analysis  for  radar  detection,  the  direction  without

The  space-time  diagram  accounting  for  the  relativistic  effects  in  the 
spherical  wave  illustrates  the  way  in  which  observers  from  K  detect  blue-
shift and red-shift o for the monochromatic radiation detected from K’ where 
the frequency of the radiation is the same in all directions say  
, the space 
distribution  being  uniform.  Detected  from  K  this  distribution  is  no  longer 
uniform (see Figure 11).

4. Conclusions 
 
The  relativistic  diagram  we  propose  displays  in  true  magnitudes  the 
vector  and  the  scalar  components  of  four  vectors.  These  components 
transform  as  the  space-time  coordinates  of  events  generated  by  moving 
tardyons or photons do.

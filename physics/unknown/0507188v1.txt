Abstract  It  is  proposed  that  the  Dirac  equation,  as  normally  interpreted,  incorporates 
intrinsic  redundancies  whose  removal  necessarily  leads  to  an  enormous  gain  in 
calculating power and physical interpretation. Streamlined versions of the Dirac equation 
can  be  developed  which  remove  the  redundancies  and  singularities  from  many  areas  of 
quantum physics while giving quantum representations to specific particle states. 
 
1 Singularities and redundancy 

 
The transformation of coordinate systems is a powerful device used in many areas of 
physics,  but  its  most  significant  effects  occur  when  the  coordinate  systems  before  and 
after the transformation are not absolutely equivalent. The particular choice of coordinate 
system  will  then  often  determine  the  subsequent  development  of  the  mathematical 
structure as a physical representation of the system being investigated; and whether or not 
the  transformation  is  desirable  will  be  determined  by  how  ‘correct’  this  physical 
representation is considered to be. Spherical polar coordinates, for example, are ideal for 
systems  with point or radial sources –  as  with the hydrogen atom or the Schwarzschild 
solution in GR – and this is because they privilege one spatial dimension (the radial) over 
the  others,  as  required.  In  these  cases  the  source  of  the  field  can  be  considered  as  a 
singularity,  but  in  other  cases  the  choice  of  such  a  coordinate  system  can  lead  to  a 
singularity  appearing  where  none  exists  in  reality.  If  we  find  that  the  mere  choice  of  a 
coordinate  system  leads  to  singularities,  then  we  have,  of  course,  introduced  a  problem 
that  needn’t  exist.  But  it  isn’t  always  only  a  single  problem.  Singularities  can  often  be 
avoided  or  overcome  by  using  special  mathematical  techniques  or  careful  definition  of 
the  valid  ‘physical’  limits  of  the  system  being  investigated,  but,  sometimes,  the 
singularity acts as a barrier, which separates the system into two seemingly unconnected 
halves,  leading  to  immediate  duplication  of  the  information  required;  in  addition,  the 
existence of an uncrossable boundary can lead to repeated duplication of information as 
the system attempts to compensate in one way or another for the loss of a connectedness 
that ought to exist. 

The  choice  of  coordinate  transformations  to  represent  rotation  has  always  been  a 
particularly  difficult  problem,  especially  when  matrix  methods,  such  as  Euler  angle 
rotation in SO(3), are used. The origin of the problem is a singularity at the point where 
the angle β = π / 2. As one author writes: ‘Inherent in every minimal Euler angle rotation

sequence in SO(3) – the group whose elements are the Special Orthogonal matrices in R3 
–  is  at  least  one  singularity.’1  Essentially,  the  problem  arises  from  the  use  of  an 
intrinsically  2-dimensional  mathematical  structure  to  represent  a  3-dimensional  reality; 
we  can,  for  example,  show  that  the  problem  is  immediately  solved  and  the  singularity 
removed  when  the  intrinsically  3-dimensional  quaternions  are  introduced.1  Exactly,  the 
same kind of reasoning can be applied to relativistic quantum mechanics, where problems 
emerge  from  the  imposition  of  a  matrix  representation.  Relativistic  quantum  mechanics 
as represented by the Dirac equation and quantum field theory produces at least one type 
of singularity that appears to be an artefact of the system – the infrared divergence. It also 
leads to infinities that have to be removed by renormalization, even in the ideal case of 
free particles where there is apparently no real source for the divergent terms. In addition, 
there  appears  to  be  a  great  deal  of  redundancy.  For  example,  QCD  calculations  using 
Feynman  diagrams  derived  from  the  standard  gamma  matrix  representation  require  ten 
million  calculations  for  a  six  gluon  interaction,  whereas  the  alternative  algebraic 
approach  using  twistor  space,  originally  proposed  by  Witten,2  reduces  the  calculations 
required to only six. Even with this method, it is clear that redundancies are still visible; 
so the question we should ask is whether it is possible to find a coordinate system for the 
fermionic state which removes redundancy entirely. 
 
2 Redundancy in the Dirac equation 
 

The Dirac equation, as conventionally written, in matrix form, 
                                             (γµ∂µ + im) ψ = 0  ,

though apparently compact, in fact contains a large amount of redundancy. The ultimate 
source  of  this  redundancy  is  a  faultline  in  the  matrix  representation  for  the  gamma 
operators  which  is  most  clearly  manifested  in  the  three  momentum  operators.  Here,  we 
find  a  system  which  is  not  rotation  symmetric,  unlike  physical  momentum.  The 
mathematical  constraints  brought  about  by  using  matrices  force  us  into  a  physical 
representation  which  does  not  reflect  reality,  and  which  may  therefore  be  inadvertently 
introducing a ‘redundancy barrier’ of the kind discussed in the previous section. (In fact, 
any mathematical representation which makes a 3-D system rotation asymmetric may be 
considered either the origin or the signature of a singularity.) 

The  gamma  operators  in  matrix  form  are  normally  expressed  using  Pauli  matrices. 
To understand the more fundamental algebra involved, however, we need first to look at 
quaternions. Quaternions (represented by bold italics) are algebraic operators multiplying 
according to the rules: 
                                              i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = −1 
                                                   ij = −ji = k 
                                                   jk = −kj = i 
                                                   ki = −ik = j .  

(2)

If  we  now  complexify  the  quaternions  (i.e.  multiply  by  pseudoscalar  i),  we  obtain  the 
products: 
                                   (ii)2 = (ij)2 = (ik)2 = −i(ii)(ij)(ik) = 1 
                                            (ii)(ij) = −(ij)(ii) = i(ik) 
                                            (ij)(ik) = −(ik)(ij) = i(ii) 
                                    (ik)(ii) = −(ii)(ik) = i(ij) . 

Another  way  of  writing  these  rules  is  to  use  multivariate  vectors  (represented  by  bold 
characters): 
                                              i2 = j2 = k2 = −iijk =1 
                                                    ij = −ji = ik 
                                                   jk = −kj = ii 
                                                   ki = −ik = ij , 
where   
                                        i = ii,        j = ij,        k = ik,  
are the units of a vector system whose general ‘full’ product for two vectors a and b of is 
of the form 
                                                ab = a.b + ia × b . 
The expressions ii, ij, ik, which emerge from the multiplication rules are the well-known 
unit pseudovectors.

The product rules for i, j, k are, of course, identical to those for Pauli matrices, σx, 
σy, σz, and Hestenes used this, as long ago as 1966, to derive the origin of spin from the 
ia × b term in the full product. Among other things, Hestenes and his followers were able 
to  show  how,  writing  the  Schrödinger  equation  in  terms  of  a  multivariate,  rather  than 
ordinary, vector ∇, automatically generates fermionic half-integral spin.3-4 So, defining

we have: 
                                              σxσy = − σyσx = iσx 
                                              σyσz = − σzσy = iσx 
                                              σzσx = − σxσz = iσy . 
But  there  is  a  fundamental  difference  between  these  two  isomorphic  systems.  Pauli 
matrices  are  not  symmetric  in  three  dimensions  because  they  are  based  on  a  two-
dimensional number system – the complex plane. The notable thing about Pauli matrices 
is  the  fact  that  the  multiplication  rules  for  their  algebraic  equivalents  involve  an  extra 
pseudoscalar term (i)  in the  pseudovector products.  This means that, at least one of the 
three  matrices  must  have  complex  coefficients,  creating  an  asymmetric  relationship 
between them.. 

This  complexity  must  also  carry  over  to  the  gamma  matrices,  as  these  are 

conventionally defined in terms of Pauli matrix components.

Immediately, we note a potential problem: there is no such physical object as px + ipy 
or px – ipy. Obviously, using the complex notation makes px orthogonal to py, so acting as 

 

4

a  kind  of  substitute  vector  addition,  but  it  can’t  be  extended  to  create  a  3-dimensional 
operator  on  an  equivalent  basis,  and  it  has  the  unwelcome  consequence  of  making  px 
physically different from py. 

 

3 Defragmenting the Dirac equation 

 
In fact, though the Dirac equation, as conventionally written (1), is the fundamental 
basis  of  particle  physics,  it  is  inconvenient  in  many  ways  in  addition  to  the  unphysical 
nature  of  the  spinor  solutions,  with  main  problems  relating  to  its  asymmetric  structure. 
Thus the operator (γµ∂µ + im) is a 4 × 4 matrix, as are each of the four terms γµ, while ψ is 
a 4-component (vector) spinor. There are many possible choices for the γ matrices, but, 
whatever choice is made, there will be mixing of the energy (γ0∂0) and mass terms, and a 
situation in which some of the momentum terms (γ.∇) have real matrix coefficients and 
others imaginary ones. 

Essentially, there are four obvious problems with the matrices: 

(1)  They  cause  fragmentation  of  the  equation,  mixing  up  energy,  momentum  and  mass 
terms. 
(2)  They  take  up  too  much  logical  space,  requiring  16  pieces  of  information  for  one 
operation. 
(3) They lack symmetry. There are 5 terms in the equation, but only 4 have a γ matrix. 
Yet there is a fifth matrix (γ5) in the algebra. 
(4)  Even  more  significantly,  as  we  have  seen,  the  momentum  operators  are  made 
asymmetric;  giving  one  of  the  momentum  operators  an  imaginary  representation  means 
that our phase space has two spacelike and two timelike components, rather than the 3+1 
structure that we believe represents physical reality. Ultimately, this leads to singularities 
and redundancy on a massive scale, which cannot be fully realised until we have found an 
alternative formalism which removes them. 

There  is,  of  course,  no  need  to  use  matrices  at  all,  other  than  historical  precedent; 
and,  if  we  use  simpler  algebraic  operators,  we  can  defragment  the  equation,  that  is, 
separate energy, momentum and mass terms from each other, each in its own ‘bin’, in the 
same  way  as  we  defragment  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  in  physical  equations  using 
ordinary  complex  numbers.  We  will  also  see  that  using  such  operators  also  solves  the 
logical space problem by reducing the 16 operators of each 4 × 4 matrix to a single term. 
The only requirement is to find a system of five operators in which  
                      (γ0)2 = (γ5)2 = 1     (γ1)2 = (γ2)2 = (γ3)2 = – 1 
and all terms anticommute with each other, so that γ0γ1 =  – γ1γ0, etc 

The most elegant way of achieving this result might be to use geometrical or Clifford 
algebra.  However,  a  more  physically  expressive  option  is  to  use  a  combination  of 
quaternions and multivariate vectors, as outlined respectively in (2) and (3), especially as 
we  know  that  the  work  of  Hestenes  and  his  school  has  demonstrated  that  quantum 

 

5

mechanics  requires  its  vector  terms  to  be  multivariate,  or  ‘quaternionic’,  and  that  this 
requirement is the origin of the otherwise mysterious property of spin.3-4 

γo = −ii 
γ1 = ik 
γ2 = jk 
γ3 = kk 
γ5 = ij , 

Preserving  the  separate  identities  of  the  quaternion  and  vector  components,  we 
generate a 32-part algebra, exactly isomorphic to that of the γ matrices, with 2 complex 
scalars, 6 complex vectors, 6 complex quaternions, and 18 complex vector quaternions; 
and we can easily relate the two algebras by making mappings of the form: 
 
 
 
 
 
or, alternatively, 
 
 
 
 
 
Both  of  these  mappings  generate  the  full  32-part  algebra;  and  both  are  relevant  to  the 
construction of a defragmented Dirac equation. If, for example, we substitute (4) into the 
component form of the Dirac equation, 
 

γo = ik 
γ1 = ii 
γ2 = ji 
γ3 = ki 
γ5 = ij .

This  apparently  trivial  step  has  profound  consequences.  The  equation  is  now  fully

Although  they  are  mathematically  compatible,  the  new  equation  (8)  takes  us  well 
beyond the conventional one. We can see this by applying the plane wave solution for a 
free-particle 
                                               ψ = A e–i(Et – p.r)   . 
 
where A is the amplitude and e–i(Et – p.r) the phase. We then find that: 
 
                            (kE + iiipx + iijpy + iikpx + ij m) A e–i(Et – p.r) = 0   , 
 
which may be more conveniently written in the form, 
 
                                    (kE + ii p + ij m) A e–i(Et – p.r) = 0  , 
 
where p is a multivariate vector. 

(9) 

Here, (kE + ii p + ij m) has a special property. It is a nilpotent, or square root of zero, 

(10) 

because 
                       (kE + ii p + ij m) (kE + ii p + ij m) = –E2 + p2 + m2 = 0 . 
 
The  only  way  in  which  this  can  be  nontrivially  accomplished  is  if  A  itself  is  the  same 
nilpotent; and, because equation (8) was obtained from equation (7) only by multiplying 
from the left, the amplitude of the Dirac wavefunction, even within the conventional form 
of the Dirac equation, must be equally nilpotent, or nilpotent, subject to multiplication by 
any  factor  from  the  right.  The  derivation,  of  course,  relies  on  the  fact,  that,  for  a 
multivariate  p,  the  product  pp  has  a  meaning  identical  to  the  product  of  the  scalar 
magnitudes pp = p2. It is also identical to the product of the helicities (σ.p) (σ.p), which 
in the case of a fermionic state with positive energy is equal to (–p)(–p), indicating that 
the  multivariate  vectors  (as  equivalent  to  Pauli  matrices)  automatically  incorporate  the 
concept  of  spin.  (While  using  a  multivariate  vector  p  means  that  we  obtain  the  spin 
directly, without needing σ.p, in cases where, for mathematical convenience, we reduce it 
to an ordinary vector, the spin must be explicitly introduced.) 
 
4 The Dirac 4-spinor 
 

Of  course,  ψ  is  not  really  a  single  term,  but  a  4-component  spinor,  which 
accommodates  fermion  and  antifermion  states,  as  well  as  spin  up  and  spin  down. 
However, identification of these is now easy: 

 

                      
                      
 

 fermion / antifermion  
 spin up / down            

  ± E 
  ± p 

 

7

We now need a 4-spinor with 4 amplitudes and 4 phases, with all 4 variations of ± E and 
± p applied to (kE + ii p + ij m) e–i(Et – p.r). 

The Dirac 4-spinor is now a column vector with 4 components: 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
each of which is operated on by (ik∂ /∂t + i∇ + ij m). 

ψ1 = (kE + ii p + ij m) e–i(Et – p.r)  
ψ2 = (kE − ii p + ij m) e–i(Et + p.r)  
ψ3 = (−kE + ii p + ij m) ei(Et – p.r)  
ψ4 = (−kE − ii p + ij m) ei(Et + p.r)  . 

However, there is one more trick we can play, and it is essential to obtaining a fully 
defragmented Dirac equation. Since our differential operator has been reduced to a single 
term from the 16 in the original matrix, we now have the logical space to turn it into a 4-
spinor,  like  the  wavefunction,  and  reduce  to  a  single  phase.  That  is,  we  transfer  the 
variation in the signs of E and p from the exponential to the differential operator. So, we 
now have:

The  Dirac  4-spinor  equation  for  a  free  particle  can  now  be  represented  by  a  row 
vector  of  4  differential  operators  acting  on  a  column  vector  of  4  eigenstates.  Using  a

This  formalism  automatically  includes  the  Feynman  representation  of  antistates  with 
negative  energy  going  backwards  in  time.  It  ensures  that  negative  energy  only  occurs 
within  negative  time,  and  that  all  states  defined  in  a  time  compatible  with 
thermodynamics  are  positive  energy  states.  It  follows  also  that  positive  energy  states 
require positive mass states, if we define mass as the ‘proper energy’, or energy within 
the  fermion’s  inertial  frame,  in  the  same  way  as  the  (positive)  proper  time  τ  in  the 
conjugate  nilpotent  expression  (± kt  ±   ii  r  +  ij  τ),  is  defined  as  the  time  within  the 
fermion’s inertial frame.

If we had written (10) in spinor form, we could, of course, have derived (11) from it 
directly, by converting the E and p terms into quantum operators, and we could use it in 
the  same  way  to  derive  the  Klein-Gordon  equation,  which,  in  this  formalism,  becomes 
merely a branch of Dirac, with an additional conversion of the amplitude:

However, while this equation can be applied to a wavefunction of any kind, for example 
the  scalar  wavefunction  of  a  boson,  because  the  nilpotency  is  provided  by  the  double 
differential operator, (11) can only be applied to a state which is a nilpotent. 

An important qualification must be made, however, to the formalism as presented in 
(11). This is derived directly from the Dirac equation as normally presented. But, from a 
physical  point  of  view,  it  would  be  more  correct  to  write  the  nilpotent  operator  in  the 
form

in  which  the  energy  operator  becomes  a  pseudoscalar,  and  the  momentum  and  mass 
operators  remain  real.  Though  the  form  (±  kE  ±  ii  p  +  ij  m)  will  be  adopted  as  a 
convention for most of this account, it will always be assumed that, physically, energy, 
and not mass, is pseudoscalar. 

p

+

i

 

Using either convention, it may be said, the equation in the defragmented nilpotent 
form  has  also  reached  its  most  perfect  pitch  of  simplicity  and  symmetry.  Operator  and 
amplitude are essentially identical, since

in operator form. In fact, we can even do away with the equation altogether! All we need 
is to specify the operator meanings for the terms separated by the three quaternion ‘bins’: 
                                                (± kE ± ii p + ij m) 
That is, E and p don’t need to be the differential operators for a free state. They can be 
covariant  derivatives  or  incorporate  field  terms  of  any  kind.  If  E  and  p  contain  field 
terms, then the phase will no longer be a pure exponential e
. It will be whatever 
function is needed to make the amplitude nilpotent. Both the amplitude and phase terms 
will be uniquely defined once the differential operator has been specified. And because 
there is only one phase term, analytical solutions will be easier to find. 

–i(Et – p.r)

Again, although the operator is in principle a 4-component spinor, the terms are not 
independent, and all the information is contained in the lead term. The remaining terms 
then  simply  offer  a  fixed  pattern  of  sign  variations  for  the  energy  and  momentum 
components;  and  the  total  effect  of  this  variation  is  merely  to  ensure  that  fermion 
amplitudes have only two possible products with each other after normalization: 0 if they 
are identical and 1 if they are not (almost like the reverse of a delta function). Essentially, 
then,  although  we  will  continue  to  use  four  components  for  the  maximum  clarity,  the 
fermionic state, and all calculation related to it, can be reduced to a single-line operator, 

 

9

composed of an energy term, a momentum term and a mass term. Symbolically, we have 
ikE + iip + ijm or ikE + ip + jm, where E and p are either operators or eigenvalues. 
 
5 Bosonic states 
 

Even  more  important  than  obtaining  particular  solutions  is  the  examination  of  the 
Dirac  state  (or  operator)  itself.  In  principle,  it  should  contain  all  the  information  about 
fermions (and bosons) that can exist. In this case, it should be a unique key to explaining 
fundamental  physical  facts.  The  nilpotent  Dirac state is, of course, a quantum operator. 
So  it  is  useful  to  show  that  it  can  do  conventional  quantum  mechanics.  Here,  we  can 
define  a  probability  density  by  multiplying  the  amplitude  by  its  complex  quaternion 
conjugate  (
)
, which produces the positive definite value 
±
8E2, and normalising to unity, though, because of the nature of nilpotent mathematics, we 
will  seldom  need  to  make  the  normalisation  explicit.  Using  this  definition,  the 
‘reciprocal’  of  (±  kE  ±  ii  p  +  ij  m)  that  occurs,  for  example,  in  the  propagator,  can  be 
identified as

The  nilpotent  state,  however,  is  superior  to  the  conventional  quantum  state  –  it  is 
automatically  second  quantized,  with  in-built  supersymmetry.  Amplitude  and  phase  are 
uniquely determined by the same operator and each is quantized in the same way. Formal 
second quantization is unnecessary. In this formulation, the differential operator and the 
eigenvalue  part  of  the  wavefunction  are  essentially  identical,  and  are  quantized  in 
identical  ways.  The  reason  for  writing  one  as  a  differential  operator  and  one  as  an 
eigenvalue term is that we then have a simultaneous representation of the nonconserved 
and the conserved parts of the equation; the Dirac equation for a free particle can then be 
seen  as  a  mathematical  expression  of  the  absolute  conservation  of  E,  p  and  m  and  the 
absolute nonconservation, or variability, of r and t. In this version of the equation, also, 
as we have seen, the four solutions exist at the same time and on the same footing – they 
differ  only  in  signs  of  E  and  p.  Quantum  field  integrals  acting  on  vacuum  produce  the 
nilpotent state vector.5 

Essentially, then, we have the basic requirements for automatic second quantization 
and a quantum field theory, the nilpotent expressions displaying the characteristics of full 
quantum  field  operators  rather  than  wavefunctions  in  the  more  restricted  sense.  This 
means that creation / annihilation operators are easily identified. The fermion state (± kE 
± iip + ijm) incorporates 4 creation (or annihilation) operators: 

Fermion creation spin up  
Fermion creation spin down      
Antifermion creation spin down 
Antifermion creation spin up  

(kE + iip + ijm)  
(kE – iip + ijm)  
(– kE + iip + ijm) 
(– kE – iip + ijm)

So we can proceed to construct state vectors for spin 1 bosons, spin 0 bosons and the 
kind  of  combinations  that  produce  Bose-Einstein  condensates,  as,  respectively,  scalar 
products  of  fermion  /  antifermion  with  the  same  helicity;  fermion  /  antifermion  with 
opposite  helicity;  and  fermion  /  fermion  with  opposite  helicity.  All  possible  interaction 
vertices between one fermion / antifermion state and another are scalar quantities, as all 
nonzero products of nilpotents are scalar. Real bosonic states are formed when the energy 
and momentum values at a vertex are equalized between the two states, and states can be 
specified as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
We  notice  here  that  the  boson  is  structured  as  a  unified  state,  with  E,  p  and  m  values 
common  to  the  fermionic  and  antifermionic  parts.  We  can,  in  fact,  postulate  that  the 
signature of a completely interacting dynamical theory of composite particles is that the 
E, p and m values have meaning only in the context of the entire state. This will become 
especially significant with baryons.

Expanding upon the above, if we represent a fermion by the row vector: 

 
(kE + ii p + ij m)  
(kE − ii p + ij m)  
 
(−kE + ii p + ij m)    
(−kE − ii p + ij m)    

 
 
 
 
and an antifermion of the same helicity by the column vector: 
 
 
 
 

(−kE + ii p + ij m) 
(−kE − ii p + ij m) 
(kE + ii p + ij m) 
(kE − ii p + ij m) ,

(kE − ii p + ij m) 
(−kE + ii p + ij m)  (kE + ii p + ij m) 
(−kE − ii p + ij m)   (kE − ii p + ij m) , 

 
a spin 1 boson can be represented by 
 
 
 
 
which sums to the scalar value 4 (E2 + p2 + m2) = 8E2 before normalisation. Even if the 
boson is massless, the product will be the same, since then 4 (E2 + p2 ) = 8E2. Massless 
spin  1  bosons  are,  of  course,  the  key  mediators  for  the  strong  and  electric  interactions 
(gluons, photons). 

In the same way, if we represent a spin 0 boson by 

(−kE − ii p + ij m) 
(−kE + ii p + ij m) 

(kE + ii p + ij m) 
(kE − ii p + ij m) 
(−kE + ii p + ij m)  (kE − ii p + ij m) 
(−kE − ii p + ij m)   (kE + ii p + ij m) , 

 
 
 
 
we will obtain the scalar value 4 (E2 – p2 + m2) = 8m2 before normalisation. However, this 
time there is a significant change. If the boson is massless, the product will be zero, since 
then  4  (E2  –  p2)  =  0.  Here,  we  can  also  use  the  concept  of  Pauli  exclusion,  since  any 
product of the form 
(
 
iE
±
±
between identical fermions will always be zero for a nilpotent state vector. The same will 
apply to
 for a massless spin 0 boson. In the nilpotent formalism, 
massless spin 0 bosons (for example, Goldstone bosons) are mathematically impossible.

The third option we have considered, the ‘Bose-Einstein condensate’, also multiplies

(kE + ii p + ij m) 

(kE + ii p + ij m) 
(kE − ii p + ij m)

(−kE − ii p + ij m)   (−kE + ii p + ij m) . 

to a nonzero scalar (–8p2 before normalisation). 
 
 
 
 
We  can  identify  this,  at  least  in  an  idealised  form,  as  being  the  spin  0  state  we  would 
expect  from:  the  unit  bosonic  state  in  a  Bose-Einstein  condensate  or  an  even-even 
nucleus; the Cooper pairs in a superconductor (e.g. He4); the combination of electron and 
magnetic  flux  line  in  the  quantum  Hall  phenomenon;  the  single-valued  wavefunctions 
produced in other applications of the Berry phase, such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect and 
the  Jahn-Teller  effect.  Many  of  these  are  spin  0  combinations,  but  there  is  one 
circumstance in which we would expect something different. This is if the two fermionic 
components are physically separated in such a way that their momentum components can 
be oppositely aligned, but with the same direction of spin. The obvious example is He3, 
which is a superconductor with spin 1. 

 

 

12

As mentioned previously, the product of two identical fermions vanishes 

(kE + ii p + ij m) = 0 
(kE + ii p + ij m) 
(kE − ii p + ij m) 
(kE − ii p + ij m) = 0 
(−kE + ii p + ij m)  (kE + ii p + ij m) = 0 
(−kE − ii p + ij m)   (kE − ii p + ij m) = 0 

 
 
 
 
The Pauli exclusion principle in this form demands nonlocality. It also means that Pauli 
exclusion can be established for each individual fermion, in calculations on many fermion 
system, without using the entire Slater determinant. 

It will be evident, in addition, that nilpotent operators are naturally supersymmetric, 

with supersymmetry operators:

So we can use Q and Q† to convert bosons to fermions / antifermions and vice versa. The 
supersymmetry is exact. Such exact supersymmetry suggests that particles are their own 
supersymmetric partners. This will become apparent when we study vacuum.

The laws of physics are not preserved under these transformations taken separately, but 
are preserved under all three operations taken together (CPT). CPT symmetry is another 
mathematical  consequences  of  a  nilpotent  representation.  We  can  represent  the 
component  P,  T  and  C  operations  on  a  nilpotent  wavefunction  by  using  a  different 
operator to represent each type of transformation:

It  is  important,  at  this  stage,  to  establish  some  fundamental  results  obtained  by 
conventional  means  before  exploring  the  special  characteristics  of  the  new  formalism. 
Particularly important is the derivation of fermion spin. In the conventional treatment of 
spin, we define a vector  σ) , with components 

                              σi

)  = iγ0γ5γ1 , with l = 1, 2, 3 

Suppose, now, that L is the orbital angular momentum of a fermion, r × p. Then, in 

γ0 = ik  ;  γ1 = ii  ;  γ2 = ji  ; γ3 = ki  ;  γ5 = ij . 

 

Now, in the nilpotent formalism 
 
So,

3σ) = –k  

and 
 

 

 

 

 γ = i1 . 

the standard formalism, 
                            [L, H] = [r × p, iγ0γ.p + γ0m] = [r × p, iγ0γ.p] . 
Taking out common factors, 
                            [L, H] = iγ0 [r, γ.p] × p  
In the nilpotent algebra, this is equivalent to 
                            [L, H] = –ki [r, 1.p] × p = –j [r, 1.p] × p .

Hence, 
                                   [L, H] = – ij 1 × p .                            
So, L is not a constant of the motion, without the additional ‘spin’ term ij 1 × p. 

(12) 

Suppose we now consider the expression 
                      [ σ) , H] = [ σ) , iγ0γ.p + γ0m] 
 
 
 
 

     [–1, H] = [–1,–j (ip1 + jp2 + kp3) + ikm] 
     = [–1,–j (ip1 + jp2 + kp3)]

since ikm and –1 commute. Multiplying this out, we obtain 
                            [–1, H] = 2j (ijp2 + ikp3 + jip1+ jkp3 + kip1 + kjp2) 
                                         = 2ij (k(p2 – p1) + j(p1 – p3) + i(p3 – p2)) 
                                         = 2ij 1 × p .                                       
Combining (12) and (13), we obtain 
                                    [L – 1 / 2, H] = 0 
which is equivalent to the conventional 
                                    [L +  σ) / 2, H] = 0 . 
Hence, (L – 1 / 2) = (L +  σ) / 2) is a constant of the motion. 

(13) 

The  nilpotent  formulation  provides  a  ready  explanation  for  the  spin-statistics 
connection. The ½-value of fermion spin, which comes from the noncommutativity of the 
components of p in the usual formal derivations, may be taken as a consequence of the 
fact that the fermion wavefunction is a square root or a single noncommutative nilpotent, 
while the 0 or 1 value of boson spin is a consequence of the boson wavefunction being a 
commutative (scalar) product of two square roots or nilpotents. 
 
8 Helicity 
 

The term 
                        σ) .p = –1.p = – p1 – p2 – p3 = – p  

is defined as helicity, and, since it has no vector or quaternion terms, and has only terms 
of the form ∂ /∂x, ∂ /∂y, and ∂ /∂z in common with 
                                     iγ0γ.p = –j (ip1 + jp2 + kp3) 
and also clearly commutes with γ0m = ikm, then 
                                    [ σ) .p, H] = [–1.p, H] = 0 
and the helicity is a constant of the motion. 

For a hypothetical particle with zero mass, the term kE + iip + ij m reduces to kE + 
iip, where p actually represents  σ) .p = –1.p. Numerically, E also becomes equal to ± p. 
For positive energy states, 
                                           E =  σ) .p = –1.p . 
So the spin is aligned antiparallel to the momentum (has left-handed helicity). Then, 
                           ij (kE + iip) = ij (k – ii ) E = (ii  – k) E  
and the spinor wavefunction follows the rule: 
                                               ij uL = – uL . 
For negative energy states, 
                                               E = –  σ) .p , 
In  this  case,  the  spin  is  aligned  parallel  to  the  momentum  (has  right-handed  helicity). 
Then, 
                            ij (kE + iip) = ij (k + ii ) E = (ii  + k) E  
and the spinor wavefunction follows the rule:

Equations  (14)  and  (15)  allow  ij  =  γ5  to  be  used,  in  conventional  theory,  as  a 

projection operator. From these equations, we may derive the relations

These  are  the  equations  which,  in  conventional  theory,  produce  two  sharply-defined 
helicity states (σ.p / 2p = ½ and –½), of which the right-handed state (p) is suppressed in 
the case of assumed massless fermions of positive energy (E) and the left-handed state (–
p) in the case of massless fermions of ‘negative energy’ (–E), or antifermions, in which E 
=  –p.  Helicity  is  a  pseudoscalar  and  so  changes  sign  under  parity  transformations;  this 
means  that  parity  must  be  violated  in  interactions  such  as  those  involving  massless 
fermions  because  the  two  helicity  states  do  not  then  make  equal  contributions  to  the 
interaction. Parity violation, in this case, is made inevitable by the suppression of mass, 
and the fixing of the E / p ratio. 

A  more  fundamental  way  of  looking  at  the  problem  is  to  return  to  the  question  of 
spin 1 and spin 0 bosons. Nilpotent structure ensures that spin 1 bosons can be massless, 
while spin 0 bosons cannot. Only a massless particle can be exclusively one-handed. The 
spin 1 boson has components that may be exclusively one-handed because if the spins of 
fermion and antifermion are aligned (in the p component), their helicities will be opposite 
because  of  their  opposite  signs  of  E.  A  spin  0  boson,  however,  has  fermion  and 
antifermion components that are in opposite spin (or p) alignment, so with states of the 
same  helicity  because  of  their  opposite  signs  of  E.  The  fact  that  nilpotency  determines 
that  spin  0  bosons  must  have  nonzero  mass  ensures  that  this  is  equivalent  to  having 
fermion and antifermion states of the same helicity, while masslessness requires states of 
opposite helicity. As we have seen, the anticommutativity of the operations involved in 
defining [L, H] ultimately ensure that the helicity term is antiparallel (or left-handed) for 
positive energy states and parallel (or right-handed) for negative energy states. 
 
9 Baryons 
 

We have already postulated an entangled system of two nilpotent states (fermion and 
antifermion)  to  describe  bosons.  Can  we  extend  this  idea  to  three  nilpotent  states  to 
describe baryons? Conventionally, we consider a baryon to be made up of three fermionic 
components, to which we assign colour to overcome Pauli exclusion. Can we relate this 
concept of colour to the fundamental structure of nilpotents? Can we have a 3-component 
state  vector?  Obviously  a  combination  involving  identical  fermions  will  be  impossible, 
because

(Here,  for  convenience,  we  have  taken  only  the  first  of  the  four  terms  of  the  tensor 
product.) So it is possible to have a nonzero state vector if we use the vector properties of 
p and the arbitrary nature of its sign (+ or –). A state vector of the form, privileging the p 
components: 
 
                  (kE ± ii ipx + ij m) (kE ± ii jpy + ij m) (kE ± ii kpz + ij m) 
 
has six independent allowed phases, i.e. when 
 
                                p = ± ipx , p = ± jpy , p = ± kpz  
 
But  these  must  be  gauge  invariant,  i.e.  indistinguishable,  or  all  present  at  once.  This 
requires an exact symmetry with an SU(3) group structure, with eight generators, exactly 
comparable  to  the  conventional  symmetry  of  the  coloured  quark  model,  with  three 
symmetric  and  three  antisymmetric  phases,  and  transitions  mediated  by  eight  massless 
spin 1 gluons.

If such a structure really does represent a baryon wavefunction, then we can predict 
that the spin is a property of the baryon wavefunction as a whole, not of component quark

wavefunctions.  It  is,  of  course,  immaterial,  with  respect  to  the  final  result,  whether  the 
signs  of  the  absent  components  of  momentum  are  positive  or  negative.  So,  it  would  be 
possible to obtain the same patterns with all three signs of px, py, pz in each combination 
the same or with one different, just as it is possible to have baryons with overall spin ½ or 
3/2. It is extremely significant, however, that this whole representation is impossible in a 
conventional spinor formulation, with terms such as px + ipy, or in any representation in 
which the momentum operators cannot show the full affine nature of the vector concept.

‘Colour’ transitions can be seen as involving either an exchange of the components 
of p between the individual quarks, or as a relative switching of quark positions, so that 
the colours either move with the respective px, py, pz components, or switch with them. 
In either model the effect is the same, and a sign reversal in p is an additional necessary 
result.  One  method  of  picturing  the  exact  symmetry  presented  in  (16)  is  to  imagine  an 
automatic mechanism of transfer between the phases. And, since the E and p terms in the 
state  vector  really  represent  time  and  space  derivatives,  we  can  replace  these  with  the 
covariant derivatives needed for invariance under a local SU(3) gauge transformation. A 
significant aspect of this SU(3) symmetry or strong interaction is that, because it depends 
entirely on the nilpotency of the component state vectors, it is entirely nonlocal. That is, 
the exchange of momentum p involved is entirely independent of any spatial position of 
the  3  components  of  the  baryon.  We  can  suppose,  therefore,  that  the  rate  of  change  of 
momentum  (or  ‘force’)  is  constant  with  respect  to  spatial  positioning  or  separation.  A 
force  that  is  constant  with  separation  is  equivalent  to  a  potential  which  is  linear  with 
distance, exactly as is required for the conventional strong interaction. 

It is significant that the symmetry evident in (16) requires equivalent status for the 
+p  and  –p  states  associated  with  positive  energy.  In  other  words,  it  requires  the 

 

18

simultaneous existence of fermionic states of both negative and positive helicity, and so 
determines  that  the  proton  or  any  other  state  with  baryonic  structure  must  have  finite 
(positive) mass. In principle, this immediately solves the mass gap problem. At the same 
time, the requirement of unbroken gauge invariance, which is a consequence of the vector 
nature of p, requires that the mediators must be massless, and so spin 1.

 ii p + ij m)i  = – i(± kE ± ii p + ij m)ii( kE 

A good test of the validity of the state vectors proposed in the preceding sections for 
bosons  and  baryons  is  to  see  if  they  reproduce  the  known  parities  for  these  systems  in 
their ground states. Defining the parity transformation on ψ as i ψ i, and assuming that 
we have defined the correct wavefunctions bosons and baryons, we can now investigate if 
these give the correct intrinsic parities in the ground state. Applying the transformation to 
a scalar boson (spin 0), we obtain: 
 
 i(± kE ± ii p + ij m)( kE 
 
                                  = – (± kE 
 
The  total  transformed  wavefunction  iψ i  thus  becomes  −ψ,  indicating  that  the  original 
wavefunction had negative parity. For the vector meson (spin 1), the result is the same, 
because: 
 
 i(± kE ± ii p + ij m)( kE ± ii p + ij m)i  = – i(± kE ± ii p + ij m)ii( kE ± ii p + ij m)i   
 
                                 = – (± kE

Trying the same operation on a baryon, we can take one of the terms, say, 

 

 

 

(kE + ij m) (kE + ij m) (kE + ii p+ ij m) , 
 

i (kE + ij m) (kE + ij m) (kE + ii p+ ij m) i . 

and apply a parity transformation, to give: 
 

 
This time, we can write it in the form: 
 

i (kE + ij m) i i (kE + ij m) i i (kE + ii p + ij m) i  
= (kE + ij m) (kE + ij m) (kE − ii p+ ij m) . 

19

Taking the result over all the terms (three with p, and three with − p), we obtain: 

         (kE + ij m) (kE + ij m) (kE − ii p + ij m) 
         (kE + ij m) (kE + ii p + ij m) (kE + ij m) 
         (kE + ij m) (kE − ii p + ij m) (kE + ij m) 
         (kE + ij m) (kE + ij m) (kE + ii p + ij m) 
         (kE − ii p + ij m) (kE + ij m) (kE + ij m) 
         (kE + ii p + ij m) (kE + ij m) (kE + ij m) , 

      i ψ i = ψ . 
 

So a baryon wavefunction, as defined, would have positive parity. Such calculations, 
of  course,  apply  to  the  ground  state  values  only,  because  if  extra  angular  momentum 
terms are added, then extra terms must be supplied to the state vectors, with the sign of 
parity reversing for each additional term. 
 
11 Vacuum 
 

A fermion creation operator (kE + ii p + ij m) is unaffected if postmultiplied by k (kE 

+ ii p + ij m) (if we assume that scalar factors are removed by normalisation). That is, 

(kE + ii p + ij m) = (kE + ii p + ij m) k (kE + ii p + ij m) k (kE + ii p + ij m) k (kE + ii p + 
ij m) … 
 
The same applies if the operator is postmultiplied by i (kE + ii p + ij m) or j (kE + ii p + ij 
m). In effect, k (kE + ii p + ij m), i (kE + ii p + ij m) and j (kE + ii p + ij m) act as vacuum 
operators, leaving the fermion state unchanged. However,  
 
(kE + ii p + ij m) = (kE + ii p + ij m) k (kE + ii p + ij m) k (kE + ii p + ij m) k (kE + ii p + 
ij m) … 
 
can also be written as 
 
(kE + ii p + ij m) = (kE + ii p + ij m) (kE – ii p + ij m) (kE + ii p + ij m) (kE – ii p + ij m) 
… 
 
with alternate states implying antifermion creation; or with the whole operation implying 
alternate creations of fermion and boson. 

Physically, we could suppose that the fermion sees in the vacuum produced by the 
operator  k  its  ‘image’  or  virtual  antistate,  producing  a  kind  of  virtual  bosonic 

20

and 

 

 

 

combination, and leading to an infinite alternating series of virtual fermions and bosons. 
Taking the fermion state as a whole, this links up with the idea that the supersymmetry 
operator  Q  and  its  Hermitian  conjugate  Q†  are  simply  the  respective  fermion  and 
  and  (
antifermion  operators,  (
.  In  the  context  of 
±
m
renormalization, with this conception of vacuum, we could see an infinite succession of 
boson and fermion loops cancelling each other, without needing to generate a new set of 
supersymmetric  partners.  The  bosons  and  fermions  become  their  own  supersymmetric 
partners.

In addition, the three vacuum coefficients, k, i and j, can be seen as originating in (or 

being responsible for) the concept of discrete (point-like) charge.  

 
 
 

fermion creation 
gluon plasma 
SU(2) 

 k (kE + ii p + ij m)         weak vacuum 
strong vacuum 
 i (kE + ii p + ij m) 
electric vacuum 
 j (kE + ii p + ij m) 

 
        
        
        
 
In this interpretation, the charges act as a discrete partitioning of the continuous vacuum 
responsible  for  zero-point  energy,  with  the  separate  conservation  laws  for  weak,  strong 
and electric charges implying that the three discrete partitions are entirely independent of 
each  other.  And  the  full  fermion  spinor  (±  kE  ±  ii  p  +  ij  m)  can  be  seen  as  being 
equivalent  to  fermion  creation  plus  three  vacuum  ‘reflections’,  corresponding  to  the 
charge states:  
 
fermion creation 
              (kE + ii p + ij m) 
 
(kE – ii p + ij m)             strong reflection 
              (– kE + ii p + ij m)          weak reflection 
              (– kE – ii p + ij m)          electric reflection 
 
Significantly, the ‘weak’ reflection is equivalent to a simultaneous switch from fermion 
to antifermion and (by preserving the sign of p) from one helicity state to another. The 
‘electric’  reflection,  on  the  other  hand  is  a  full  charge  conjugation  (with  no  change  in 
helicity), while the ‘strong’ reflection is a spin reversal. 

It appears that the nilpotent state vector incorporates real and virtual components in 
the same way as mass and charge. Zitterbewegung is a switching between them. This is 
why  state  vectors  are  supersymmetric.  It  is  a  quantum  equivalent  of  action  plus  virtual 
reaction.  To  put  it  in  another  way,  the  ‘reflection’  of  a  fermionic  creation  in  a  charged 
‘mirror’  is  equivalent  to  defining  the  rest  of  the  universe  for  that  creation,  just  as 
Newton’s classical process of action and reaction is really between a body and the rest of 
the  universe,  rather  than  between  two  isolated  bodies.  Because  we  can  only  define  a 
fermion  by  also  defining  the  rest  of  the  universe,  the  fermion  itself  is  only  half  of  the 
picture.  This  is  what  we  mean  by  saying  that  a  fermion  has  half-integral  spin.  The 

 

21

fermion  state  is  incomplete  without  its  vacuum  (and,  indeed,  supersymmetric)  partner; 
they  are  analogous  to  the  action  and  reaction  sides  of  a  steady-state  potential  energy 
equation,  with  the  fermion  state  alone  represented  by  kinetic  energy;  and  it  is  even 
possible to apply a classical kinetic energy equation for magnetic moment in a magnetic 
field  to  produce  the  ½-integral  value  of  spin.  In  addition,  fermions  not  only  carry  with 
them  the  virtual  vacuum  partners  which  describe  their  interactions  with  the  rest  of  the 
universe, but they are also able, in appropriate circumstances, to realise them (singly) as 
real (mass-shell) partners, either through the creation of real boson or boson-like states or, 
in less compactified form, through applications of the Berry phase. 
 
12 The self-energy of a free fermion 
 

If supersymmetry is exact in the formalism proposed, then a free fermion in vacuum 
will produce its own loop cancellations and its energy will acquire a finite value without 
renormalization. Free fermion plus boson loops should cancel. That this is indeed the case 
can be shown by performing a basic perturbation calculation for first order coupling, and 
showing  that  it  leads  to  zero  in  the  case  of a free fermion. Suppose we have a fermion 
acted on by the electromagnetic potentials φ, A. Then

Of course, an interacting fermion would still require ‘renormalization’, and this can 
be  carried  out  using  the  usual  methods  of  QED,  QCD  and  QFD  (though  with  a  cut-off 
energy that emerges naturally from the gravitational-inertial event horizon as the Planck 
mass).6 However, what this means is that a ‘charge’ actually acquires its intrinsic value or 
coupling constant from the ‘vacuum’, that is, from its interaction with all other charges of 
the same kind, exactly as we would expect from the definition of interactions, in nilpotent 
theory,  as  arising  purely  from  vacuum  ‘reflections’.  The  so-called  renormalization 
process would then be one of scaling, the scale not being fixed until the interaction with 
the  ‘rest  of  the  universe’  (‘vacuum’)  was  taken  into  account.  It  would  be  an  exact 
expression  of  nonlocality,  although  preserving,  of  course,  the  4-vector  connection 
between space and time and energy and momentum characteristic of these interactions. 

 

13 BRST quantization 

 
The  Dirac  nilpotent  operator,  being  automatically  second  quantized,  already 
incorporates a full quantum field representation. More conventional approaches to field 
quantization,  however,  can  be  used  to  demonstrate  the  relation  between  charge  and 
energy operators, which the nilpotent formalism requires. Nilpotent operators of a special 
kind are, in fact, already used in standard quantum field theory, and it will be instructive 
to make a direct link between these and terms of the form (± kE ± iip + ijm), considered 
as  both  energy  and  charge  operators.  In  the  standard  theory,  field  quantization  requires 
gauge  fixing  before  propagators  can  be  constructed.  The  canonical  quantization  of  the 
electromagnetic field uses Coulomb gauge, but this means that Lorentz invariance must 
be  broken.  The  path  integral  approach  allows  us  to  use  any  gauge,  and  so  maintain 
Lorentz invariance, but the problem now is the introduction of nonphysical or ‘fictitious’ 

 

24

Fadeev-Popov ghost fields. A version used in string theory (BRST) eliminates the ghost 
fields by packaging all the information into a single operator, applied to the Lagrangian. 
Significantly,  the  BRST  operator  (δBRST)  is  a  nilpotent.  This  operator  can  be  used  to 
construct a Noether current (Jµ), corresponding to a nilpotent BRST conserved fermionic 
charge (QBRST). The condition for defining a physical state then becomes 

 

                                                    QBRST  ψ  = 0 . 
 

In the Dirac nilpotent formulation, (± kE ± iip + ijm), which applies only to physical 
(mass  shell)  states,  is  already  second  quantized,  and  a  nilpotent  operator  of  the  form 
δBRST.  It  is,  also,  a  nilpotent  charge  operator  of  the  form  QBRST,  but  extended  to 
incorporate  weak  and  strong,  as  well  as  electromagnetic,  charges.  It  is,  finally,  in  its 
eigenvalue form, identical to  ψ . So the three possible meanings for the expression (± 
kE  ±  iip  +  ijm)  apply,  respectively,  to:  E  and  p  interpreted  as  differential  operators  in 
time and space; E, p and m as coefficients determining the nature of the charges specified 
by  k,  i  and  j;  and  E  and  p  interpreted  as  eigenvalues  of  energy  and  momentum.  The 
nilpotent  Dirac  operator  thus  supplies  simultaneously  all  the  characteristics  which  the 
separate BRST terms δBRST, QBRST, and  ψ  require. 
 
14 The infrared divergence 

 
The  comprehensive  packaging  and  defragmentation  in  the  nilpotent  formalism  also 
removes  anomalies  in  the  theory  of  propagators. Conventional calculations separate the 
positive and negative energy states, leading to divergences, which are avoided in ordinary 
physical  circumstances  (though  not  removed)  only  by  using  cumbersome  and  rather 
arbitrary  procedures  involving  contour  integrals.  Thus,  in  the  Feynman  formalism,  the 
electron propagator is given by the expression

which  means  that  there  is  a  singularity  or  ‘pole’  (p0)  where  p2  –  m2  =  0,  the  ‘pole’  or 
‘infrared  divergence’  being  the  point  at  which  electrons  switch  to  positron  states.  It  is 
assumed that, on either side of the pole we have positive energy states moving forwards 
  and 
in  time,  and  negative  energy  states  moving  backwards  in  time,  the  terms  (
 being used to project out, respectively, the positive and negative energy states.

Writing  the  denominator  of  the  propagator  as  a  nilpotent,  however,  makes  the 
addition of an iε term unnecessary, because there is now no infrared divergence and no

where  ω  takes  the  place  of  E  /  m.  This  time,  of  course,  φ(x)  and  φ(x')  are  scalar 
wavefunctions. In our notation, they are each scalar products of the 4-component bra term 
(±  kE  ±  iiσ.p  +  ijm)  and  the  4-component  ket  term  ( kE  ±  iiσ.p  +  ijm),  multiplied 
respectively by exponentials exp (ipx) and exp (ipx'), expressed in terms of the 4-vectors 
p, x and x'. In the nilpotent formulation, φ(x)φ*(x') reduces to a product of a scalar term 
(which can be removed by normalization) and exp ip(x – x' ). In general, in off-mass-shell 
conditions, poles in the propagator are a mathematical, rather than physical problem; but, 
in  the  specific  case  of  massless  bosons,  conventional  theory  states  that  ‘infared’ 
divergencies occur when such bosons are emitted from an initial or final stage which is 
on the mass shell. Such divergencies, however, will not occur where there is no pole. 

m

The  significant  aspect  of  this  analysis  is  that  it  shows  that  one  of  the  principal 
divergences  in  quantum  electrodynamics  is  (as  the  procedure  used  to  remove  it  would 
suggest) merely an artefact of the mathematical structure we have imposed, and not of a 
fundamentally  physical  nature.  As  with  the  ‘infinite’  self-energy  of  the  non-interacting 
fermion, it is a classic case of the action of a ‘redundancy barrier’. Its automatic removal 
in  the  nilpotent  formalism  is  another  indication  of  the  method’s  power  and  general 
applicability, and of the defragmentation process which it involves. 

 

15 The Casimir effect 
 

Though the weak, strong and electric partitions of the vacuum are discrete, reflecting 
the discrete nature of the fermions which define it, the combined vacuum may be thought 
of  as  continuous,  in  the  sense  that  the  action  of  a  fermionic  creation  operator  on  any 
discrete realisation of it would immediately produce zero, as in: 
                      (± kE ± ii p + ij m) 1 (± kE ± ii p + ij m) = 0 . 

In effect, the meaning of Pauli exclusion is that the total vacuum cannot be discrete, but 
must  be  a  virtual  realisation  of  the  entire  range  of  possible  fermionic  states.  (We  may 
perhaps  consider  that  the  action  of  a  fermionic  state  on  this  continuum  is  to  produce  a 
singularity, a zeroing at that point in phase space.) A continuous vacuum, with an infinite 
range of vibration modes of zero-point energy  ωh½ , produces the well-known Casimir 
force of attraction between uncharged metal plates of area A and small separation d:

Because  of  the  dependence  on  1  /  d4,  the  Casimir  force  manifests  itself  over  the 
range 1  µm as a dipole-dipole interaction, and of exactly the same kind as the Van der 
Waals  force  of  cohesion  between  molecules.  This  interpretation  is  based  on  zero-point 
fluctuations in the space between the plates or molecules, but, as Peterson and Metzger 
point out,7 it is equally possible to represent the interaction as zero-point fluctuations of 
the  electrons  in  the  metal  surfaces.  In  this  case  it  becomes  the  London  dispersion 
interaction. A third picture (Hellmann-Feynman) sees the quantum charge clouds in the 
two  plates,  molecules  or  other  objects  becoming  deformed  as  they  approach, 
corresponding to a change in the expectation values of their charge distributions. In this 
case,  the  force  is  identical  to that of chemical bonding due to the classical electrostatic 
force. 

Peterson  and  Metzger  show,  in  effect,  that  the  Casimir  force  is  not  a  distinct 
phenomenon, but an aspect of the classical electromagnetic interaction. They use it as a 
means of removing such unobservables as quantum fluctuations from the argument, but 
we  can  turn  the  argument  round  so  that  the  ordinary  electromagnetic  force  becomes  a 
vacuum  projection.  An  inverse  fourth  power  Casimir  effect  between  objects,  which  are 
electrically  neutral  globally  but  composed  locally  of  electrostatic  dipoles,  would  then 
require an inverse square force between the individual charged particles of which they are 
composed. And there is no reason why the electrostatic force should be special – merely 
measurable  at  longer  range  than  the  others.  Related  effects  of  aggregated  matter,  for 
example  nuclear  forces,  would  become  Casimir-type  manifestations  of  vacuum 
fluctuations,  either  fermionic  or  bosonic,  as  much  as  interactions  between  discrete 
charges specified by expectation values. 

Describing the forces due to discrete charges (electric, strong, weak) as Casimir-type 
manifestations  of  the  vacuum,  relates  directly  to  the  respective  use  of  the  quaternion 
operators  j,  i,  k  both  for  these  three  charges,  and  for  the  operation  of  the  respective 
electric, strong, weak vacua via j(± ikE ± ip + jm), i(± ikE ± ip + jm), k(± ikE ± ip + jm). 
Because the operators are attached respectively to pseudoscalar E, vector p and scalar m, 
in  the  state  vector,  then  their  vacua  will  have  different  effects,  and  so  the  forces  will 
behave  differently.  However,  the  key  driving  mechanism  in  all  Casimir  calculations  is 
that they are the result of separating out discrete objects from a continuous background, 
and that they only have meaning in the context of object pairs. The creation of a discrete 
object pair at some finite separation generates a force because it creates a discrete space 
which  is  shielded  from  some  of  the  modes  of  vacuum  vibration  outside  this  space.  In 
principle, this allows us to consider all interactions between discrete charged objects, and 
even the values of the charged coupling constants, as resulting from the existence of the 
rest of the universe as a vacuum state, exactly in line with renormalization and Mach’s 
principle for the parallel case of inertial mass. 

It seems, then, that we can take the Casimir and related effects as the way in which 
the discrete charged vacua manifest themselves in relation to the continuous total vacuum 

 

28

background;  they  represent  the  partitioning  of  the  vacuum  through  the  three  types  of 
charge state (or singularity). Whether the charge states are occupied or not (that is, have 
unit or zero values) is established on the basis of relative phases between the components 
of  the  state  vector.  Charge  occupancy  then  determines  particle  type  and  possible 
interactions. The vacuum, however, is the mechanism by which this becomes manifested; 
the creation of discrete units with non-zero occupation status creates the ‘distortions’ of 
vacuum, which we call interactions, in the same way as the presence of discrete sources 
creates the vacuum response or distortions of simply-connected space which we call the 
Aharonov-Bohm effect and the Berry phase. 

In general terms, vacuum may be thought of as the driving mechanism for assembly / 
disassembly and self-organization within aggregated matter, and for such things as phase 
transitions,  effectively  through  the  weak  charge  which  defines  fermionic  matter.  The 
Casimir effect will be attractive for bosons because they are weak dipoles, but repulsive 
for  fermions  because  they  are  weak  monopoles.  The  difference  in  status  between  the 
‘real’ and image terms in the Dirac 4-spinor for a free particle, even if the ‘real’ particle 
is actually a vacuum state, also means that the Casimir effect does not require a broken 
supersymmetry  to  be  observed,  because  loop  cancellation  is  only  at  the  level  of  the 
‘image’ terms. 

The creation and annihilation of fermions is, of course, one kind of phase transition, 
and  involves  the  creation  and  annihilation  of  units  of  weak,  and  other,  charges.  The 
assembly  of  states  of  matter  at  other  levels  is  equally  concerned  with  the  effect  of  the 
weak  charge.  Most  of  the  properties  of  gaseous  and  condensed  matter  relate  to  the 
harmonic oscillator behaviour of its components, while the dipolar Van der Waals force, 
which expresses in its most fundamental aspect the nature of the weak vacuum, plays a 
significant  role  in  all  material  phases.  In  addition,  the  properties  of  the  solid  state  are 
determined by the Pauli exclusion principle that invariably accompanies the presence of 
weak  charge,  while  Bose-Einstein  condensation  is  effectively  the  elimination  of  this 
charge  and  its  dipolarity,  through  the  property  of  weak  charge  conjugation  violation. 
Another  phase  transition  of  the  Van  der  Waals-type  occurs  with  the  creation  of 
interbaryonic, or nuclear, matter through a remnant of the strong forces between quarks, 
and this can be seen, in at least in part, as a Bose-Einstein condensation. 

 
16 SU(3) 
 

As we have seen, the vector nature of the p term in the Dirac nilpotent state vector 
produces  a  natural  SU(3)  symmetry  for  the  strong  interaction,  which  is  reflected  in  the 
possible phases of the baryon state: 

                  (kE ± ii px + ij m) (kE ± ii py + ij m) (kE ± ii pz+ ij m) . 
 

 

29

The SU(3) symmetry thus expresses the perfect gauge invariance between all the possible 
phases, that is, with p = ± px, p = ± py, and p = ± pz. The same would, of course, apply for 
those  bosons  (such  as  pions),  which  are  held  together  by  the  strong  interaction.  The 
massless spin 1 gluons, which act as carriers, would have state vectors of the form (kE ± 
ii px) (
y), etc. Conventionally, we express the SU(3) symmetry via a 4-vector 
covariant derivative, which takes the form: 

 kE ± ii p

Through  their  relation  to  momentum  components,  the  three  colours  are  directly 
mapped onto the three dimensions of space, with the same indistinguishability, which is 
why the structure of real baryons is effectively affine, with a multiplicity of fractal-like 
structures  involving  gluons  and  virtual  baryons  beyond  the  arrangement  of  the  valence 
quarks.  We  see  from  these  structures  that  the  ‘active’  term  ‘transferred’  in  the  strong 
interaction  is  the  vector  term  (igs  λα  Aα  /  2),  which,  in  each  phase,  becomes  the 
instantaneous  carrier  of  the  ‘colour’  component  of  the  interaction,  or,  equivalently,  the 
‘strong  charge’  (s).  The  concept  of  ‘transfer’  is,  of  course,  a  way  of  realising  the 
superposition of all six phases, though, as we have already specified, it can be conceived 
of in terms of a scalar potential which is linear with distance. The scalar part of Aαµ (x), 
however,  is  not  transferred,  and  we  will  see  that  this  coincides  with  an  additional 
Coulomb component (or inverse linear potential) which is needed to define the spherical 
symmetry  appropriate  to  a  point  source.  In  effect,  this  scalar  or  ‘passive’  component 
(which  is  a  universal  aspect  of  all  fundamental  interactions)  is  equivalent  to  the 

 

30

magnitude or scalar value of the strong coupling constant or strong charges. It has been 
shown,  on  the  basis  of  reasonable  assumptions,  that,  at  Grand  Unification,  only  this 
component would remain for the strong, weak and electric interactions, and that its value 
would be equivalent to the one expected for a gravitational or inertial force, namely the 
Planck mass.8 

 

17 SU(2)L × U(1) 
 

A ‘weak interaction’ is a demonstration that intrinsic left-handedness is an identical 
phenomenon  in  all  fermionic  states,  while  intrinsic  right-handedness  is  an  identical 
phenomenon in all antifermionic states, irrespective of the composition of the fermion or 
antifermion.  So,  the  intrinsic  handedness  is  preserved  irrespective  of  any  ‘transition’ 
between  one  state  and  another.  All  fermionic  states,  therefore,  seek  to  demonstrate  the 
gauge  invariance  of  one-handedness  with  respect  to  all  other  possible  fermionic  states 
with probabilities determined by the energy, momentum and mass terms involved. This is 
what  is  meant  by  a  ‘transition’.  In  any  such  transition,  the  anti-state  to  the  state  to  be 
annihilated  and  the  state  which  is  to  be  created  must  exist  as  a  spin  1  bosonic 
combination. Because of quark confinement, there can be no transition from free fermion 
to quark, or quark to free fermion – that is, there can be no pure weak transition in which 
a fermion acquires or loses a ‘vector’ character. However, fermion states with mass also 
carry  a  degree  of  right-handedness.  A  non-vector  transition  from  left-  to  right-
handedness,  involving  only  fermionic  states  (not  antifermionic),  requires  the  vacuum 
which  we  have  described  as  ‘electric’.  Only  the  electric  vacuum  carries  a  transition  to 
right-handedness where the vector character is absent, and, to produce a pure transition 
from  left-  to  right-handedness  (and  vice  versa)  without  a  change  from  fermion  to 
antifermion requires an electroweak combination (jk, equivalent to i): 

m

electric transition to right-handed fermion 

 
 (± kE ± ii p + ij m) 
( kE ± ii p + ij m) 
m
(± kE 
 ii p + ij m) 
 
Using the concept of electric ‘charge’ as indicating the presence of right-handedness, 
we  may  identify  four  possible  transitions  (taking  the  ‘left-handed’  /  ‘right-handed’ 
transition  to  mean  ‘the  acquisition  of  a  greater degree of right-handedness’), and hence 
four possible intermediate bosonic states: 

 
 
 
 

 

 

Left-handed to left-handed 
Left-handed to right-handed 
Right-handed to left-handed 
Right-handed to right-handed 

31

The left- / right-handed transition clearly has the nature of an SU(2)L symmetry, with the 
requirement  of  three  generators,  which  are  necessarily  massive,  to  carry  the  right-
handedness unrecognised by the interaction, and two of which carry electric ‘charge’ (+ 
and –), in addition to one which leaves the handedness unchanged. This leaves the fourth 
transition state or equivalent as an extra generator with a U(1) symmetry. If we assume 
that massive generators are necessary for a ‘weak interaction’, and indicate its presence, 
we  can  assign  the  fourth  generator  to  the  pure  electric  interaction.  Electric  charge, 
however, is not the sole reason for the massiveness (and hence mixed handedness) of real 
fermionic states. So the absence of electric charge does not indicate that a weak generator 
must be massless. So, the two generators without electric charge are assumed mixed, the 
combination  producing  two  new  generators,  one  of  which  becomes  massless  and  so 
carries the pure electric, rather than the weak interaction. 

m

To  write  the  SU(2)L  directly  into  the  nilpotent  representation,  we  can  consider  a 
lepton, for example, to be a superposition of states of the form (± kE ± ii p + ij m) and (± 
kE 
 ii p + ij m), of which only the first acts weakly, while the neutrino is more likely to 
show Majorana behaviour as a superposition of (± kE ± ii p + ij m) and ( kE ± ii p + ij 
m). Baryons might be constructed in such a way that each strong phase is a superposition 
similar  to  that  for  the  lepton.  Further  splitting  of  states  into  superpositions  might  be 
needed  to  fully  incorporate  the  full  range  of fermionic particles within the three quark-
lepton generations. 

m

We  can  also  relate  the  argument  derived  from  the  nilpotent  structure  to  the 
conventional  formalism  for  SU(2)L  ×  U(1),  with  Wµ  and  Bµ  as  the  respective  4-vector 
generators  for  SU(3)  and  U(1).  Once  again,  we  may  write  these  down  in  the  form  of 
covariant derivatives. For left-handed states, we have:

With m determined from the combination of E and p, we can, by appropriate choice 
of the value of m, make these compatible, by additionally defining a combination of the 
coupling constants related to the SU(2)L and U(1) symmetries, g' and g, which removes 
B3  from  E  and  W0  from  p.  It  is,  of  course,  significant  here  that  it  is  Bµ  which  is 
characteristic of right-handed lepton states, and therefore associated with the production 
of mass. Writing these combinations as γ0 (where γ0 / 2 is equivalent to the electrostatic 
potential φ) and Z3, and those of g' and g, as e and w (= g), we obtain:

In many respects the weak and electric interactions are similar. The most significant 
similarity  is  the  absence  of  any  vector  component.  However,  the  pseudoscalar  operator 
(incorporating the necessary mathematical pairing of +i and –i) determines that the weak 
interaction has an intrinsically dipolar source, but, because of the intrinsically one-handed 
nature of the interaction, this dipole does not accommodate two real charges, but one real 
charge and its virtual vacuum reflection. Another way of representing this is to say that 
the  weak  vacuum  is  filled  for  states  negative  energy  (–iE),  in  much  the  same  way  as 
Dirac’s original antimatter vacuum was filled (and for the same reason). It is because of 
this that the ground state of the ‘rest of the universe’ has no negative energy states, and 
that  matter  predominates  over  antimatter  –  the  explanation  requires  physics,  not 
cosmology.  The  weak  vacuum  requires  an  energy  continuum  in  the  same  way  as  the 
conjugate  variable  time  irreversibility  requires  continuity  of  time.  It  is  precisely  this 
continuity which makes possible both Pauli exclusion and its corollary, nonlocality. Pauli 
exclusion is a direct property of nilpotency, a mathematical condition which is only made 
possible by the presence of a pseudoscalar term. As we have shown, all these facts are 
consequences of the mathematical structure of the nilpotent Dirac operator. 

Significantly, the exchange of electromagnetic charge, through W+ or W–, is not itself 
an  electromagnetic  interaction,  but  rather  an  indication  of  the  weak  interaction’s 
indifference  to  the  presence  of  the  electromagnetic  charge.  A  ‘weak  interaction’,  in 
principle, is a statement that all states of a particle with the same weak charge are equally 
probable,  given  the  appropriate  energy  conditions,  and  that  gauge  invariance  is 

 

 

33

maintained with respect to them. Weak bosons are massive because they act as carriers of 
the  electromagnetic  charge,  whereas  electromagnetic  bosons  (or  photons)  are  massless 
because  they  do  not.  The  quantitative  value  of  the  mass  must  be  determined  from  the 
coupling  of  the  weak  charge  to  the  asymmetric  vacuum  state  which  produces  the 
violation  of  charge  conjugation  in  the  weak  interaction.  The  weak  interaction  is  also 
indifferent to the presence of the strong charge, and so cannot distinguish between quarks 
and leptons (hence, the intrinsic identity of purely lepton weak interactions with quark-
lepton  or  quark-quark  ones)  and,  in  the  case  of  quarks,  it  cannot  tell  the  difference 
between a filled ‘electromagnetic vacuum’ (up quark) and an empty one (down quark). 
The weak interaction, in addition, is also indifferent to the sign of the weak charge, and 
responds  (via  the  vacuum)  only  to  the  status  of  fermion  or  antifermion  –  hence,  the 
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing. 

18 Charge structures 
 

The  four  components  of  the  nilpotent  Dirac  spinor  have  been  identified  as  the 
fermion  and  its  three  discrete  vacuum  ‘reflections’  under  transitions  which  would  have 
the  characteristics  of  the  weak,  strong  and  electric  interactions.  The  spinor  can  thus  be 
considered  as  containing  the  full  potentiality  of  what  any  fermionic  state  could  be 
transformed into, and the weak, strong and electric interactions as the means of making 
this transfer. It is significant that the gravitational or inertial interaction is ‘passive’ in this 
respect, the vacuum reflection (expressible as 1ψ or scalar × ψ) leading to the state itself. 
We  can  consider  a  fermion  (with  creation  operator  specified  by  the  first  term  in  the 
spinor) as having the potentiality to be switched by the appropriate interaction into any of 
the  vacuum  reflections  that  it  carries  with  it,  and  that  are  specified  by  the  quaternion 
operators labelled k, i, j, and that might be specified by the respective weak, strong and 
electric  charges.  In  this  respect,  the  action  of  the  weak  force  becomes  a  change  of 
fermion to antifermion, with a corresponding change in helicity; the action of the strong 
force becomes a change in helicity, without a change of fermionic status; while the action 
of  the  electric  force  becomes  a  change  from  fermion  to  antifermion,  without  a 
corresponding change in helicity. 

There  is,  however,  a  significant  distinction  between  the  two  types  of  fundamental 
fermion  –  quarks  and  leptons  –  in  that  only  quarks  incorporate  the  explicit  vector 
behaviour  of  the  momentum  operator  in  their  spinor  state  vectors.  We  can  account  for 
this distinction in terms of vector phase. So a baryon state vector might have a form such 
as

Here the charge reflections are all equally present, but have different phases, the phases 
being  determined  by  that  of  the  momentum  operator,  as  determined  by  the  strong 
interactions (which, in the baryonic system, would naturally be associated with that of the 
inertial or total particle state). 

On  the  other  hand,  leptons,  with  no  explicit  vector  phases,  would  have  all 

components in phase at once in the successive manifestations of p as p1, p2 and p3, as in

Such a consideration of phases (along with the symmetries known for each interaction) 
produces  structures  for  all  fundamental  fermions  indicating  the  charge  activity  in  each 
phase  for  all  vacuum  reflections.  The  structures  show  that  the  expressions  for  the 
nilpotent Dirac spinors give direct information on charge activity, as well as on energy, 
momentum  and  rest  mass  (or  space,  time  and  proper  time).  Since  there  are  five 
fundamental  quantities  or  ‘dimensions’  associated  with  weak  charge,  strong  charge  (in 
three colours) and electric charge, along with five ‘dimensions’ associated with E, p and 
m,  we  can  consider  the  nilpotent  spinor  as  a  mathematical  object  in  a  10-dimensional 
phase space (with a conjugate real space) which provides all the basic requirements for a 
string theory without confinement to a specific model, along with an underlying algebraic 
structure with direct connections to such groups associated with string theory as SO(32) 
and  E8  (and  because  of  its  origin  in  the  eight  fundamental  units  of  multivariate  vectors 
plus quaternions, an easy mapping to either an octonion or a twistor representation).9,10 
‘Dimensionality’,  of  course,  is  definable  in  many  ways;  and  the  nilpotent  operator  can 
also  be  seen  according  to  different  criteria  as  1-,  2-,  3-,  4-,  5-,  6-,  8-  or  even  higher-
dimensional, and a variety of different geometrical algebras can be used to create the 64 

 

35

unit  structures  needed  for  the  gamma  matrices.  The  multiplicity  of  dimensionalities  is 
provided  by  the  fact  the  basic  units  contain  two  independent  3-dimensional  systems. 
However,  the  10-dimensional  representation  is  exactly  of  the  kind  required  by  string 
theory. Also, the requirement for a perfect string theory is that self-duality in phase space 
determines  vacuum  selection.  The  nilpotent  operator  is  self-dual,  expressed  in  terms  of 
phase  space,  and  completely  determines  vacuum  selection.  Here,  we  have  that 
requirement fulfilled exactly, without any need for an intermediate ‘physical’ model, and 
an  embedding  eleventh  ‘dimension’  is  provided  by  the  Hilbert  space  within  which  the 
state vectors operate. 
 
19 The electric interaction: inverse linear potential 
 

Previously, we have speculated, on the basis of an extension of Noether’s theorem, 
that the conservation of ‘type of charge’ (weak, strong or electric) corresponds exactly to 
the conservation of angular momentum.11 As the behaviour related to these charges has 
now  been  located  in  the  p  or  ‘spin’  term,  which  incorporates  the  angular  momentum 
aspect of the fermionic state vector, we can now be more specific about the meaning of 
this  connection.  Essentially,  charge  is  defined  for  a  point  source,  with  spherical 
symmetry.  Spherical  symmetry  effectively  determine  angular  momentum  conservation, 
and has three fundamental aspects, namely the facts that the symmetry is independent of 
the length of the radius vector, of its direction (or choice of axes), and of the handedness 
of  the  rotation  (left  or  right).  We  can  see  immediately  that  these  correspond  to  the 
respective  U(1),  SU(3)  and  SU(2)  or  O(3)  symmetries.  We  can  also  show, 
mathematically,  that  only  three  conditions  exist  in  which  a  nilpotent  state  vector  can 
maintain spherical symmetry.12 All require the actions of scalar potentials: and these are 
inverse linear with distance, which corresponds to U(1); direct linear with distance plus 
inverse  linear,  which  corresponds  to  SU(3);  and  any  other  spherically  symmetrical 
relation with distance plus inverse linear. The last incorporates the special case of inverse 
third power plus inverse linear, which is characteristic of a dipole-dipole force, such as 
the  pure  weak  interaction  requires,  and  which  provides  a  harmonic  oscillator  solution, 
exactly corresponding to the characteristic behaviour of the weak interaction as a creator 
and destroyer of fermion-antifermion pairs, or, in effect, weak dipoles. 

The defragmented Dirac equation is remarkably easy to solve in these cases, as the 
energy,  momentum  and  mass  operators  maintain  their  separate  identities  through  all 
operations.  This  means  that  we  don’t  need  to  break  up  the  wavefunction  into  separate 
energy and momentum eigenfunctions to do calculations. The method is also completely 
general, and can be applied to any type of potential. In principle, all we need to do is to 
set up a differential operator with the appropriate field terms, and then find the function 
which will make its eigenvalue (taken over the four solutions equivalent to ± E, ± p) a 
nilpotent.  The  method  is  exact  and  analytic  and  provides  the  full  ‘hydrogen  atom’ 

 

36

solution (involving hyperfine levels) in the case of the pure Coulomb interaction in just 
seven steps (though a few more will be added here for clarity). It could even be argued 
that  it  is  more  strictly  correct  than  the  conventional  method,  which  assumes  that 
amplitudes that vary with position can be treated as constant. 

It  will  be  convenient,  in  all  these  calculations,  to  use  ordinary  vectors,  rather  than 
multivariate vectors, so we can use the standard conversion of the ∇ or σ.∇ term to polar 
coordinates, with explicit introduction of fermionic spin. So we write:

where  V(r)  is  the  radially-dependent  potential  energy  term.  It  will  quickly  become 
apparent  that,  unless  V(r)  contains  an  expression  of  the  form  A  /  r,  or  –  A  /  r,  to 
compensate  for  those  in  the  term  beginning  with  i,  then  no  nilpotent  solution  can  be 
found.  We  can  regard  this  Coulomb  term  as  the  minimum  requirement  for  spherical 
symmetry.  It  is,  as  we  have  previously  stated,  an  expression  of  the  magnitude  of  the 
charge, or the coupling constant. So, we begin with:

20 The strong interaction: linear plus inverse linear potential 

The  inverse  linear  potential  gives  the  scalar  phase  solution  expected  for  a  U(1) 
symmetry, such as we have associated with the electric interaction, where the charge is a 
pure scalar magnitude. We have already shown that a direct linear potential provides the 
requirements for the vector term needed for the strong interaction, though once again a 
Coulomb  term  is  needed  for  magnitude  and  for  spherical  symmetry.  No  other  special 
solution exists which gives nilpotency along with spherical symmetry. In principle, it is 
not  significant  whether  the  source  of  the  strong  field  on  a  quark  is  an  antiquark  in  a 
mesonic  combination,  or  a  strong  centre  of  charge  acting  equally  on  the  three  quark 
components of a baryon. The solution will be structurally the same in each case, differing 
only in the specific values for numerical constants. 

First of all we set up an operator of the form:

The imaginary exponential terms in ψ can be interpreted as representing asymptotic

and can be written as a phase, φ (r) = exp (
iqA ln (r)), which varies less rapidly with r

Where r is small (at high energies), the first term dominates, approximating to a free 
fermion solution (which can be interpreted as asymptotic freedom). When  r is large (at 
low energies) the second term dominates, bringing in the confining potential (B) (which 
can  be  interpreted  as  infrared  slavery).  Significantly,  the  phase  term φ  incorporates  the 
Coulomb or scalar phase component. Reducing the potential V(r) to the Coulomb term, 
which  is  what  we  suppose  might  happen  effectively  at  short  distances,  produces  a 
hydrogen-like spectral series, with exactly the same structure as in the previous section. 
We can use the full and Coulomb-like solutions to investigate the transition point at 

which infrared slavery becomes effective. From the full solution, let

If,  from  the  Coulomb-like  solution,  we  take  the  ‘free-particle’  transition  energy  as  the 
mass of the state m, and assume that this mass is mostly dynamic (gluonic) in origin, then 
we  find  Br =  2E,  suggesting  a  virial  relationship,  as  would  be  expected  with  a  linear 
potential. 

The  calculation  in  this  section  has  been  performed  for  a  quark-antiquark  pair. 
Extending  it  to  a  3-quark  system,  we  can  expect  that  the  magnitude  of  the  ‘active’ 
coupling is essentially identical, while the ‘passive’ or Coulomb coupling is related by a 
virial factor, so that A3Q ≈ AQQ / 2 (in line with the theoretically-assumed value of 2αs / 3 
for the magnitude of A). This would accord with the model of Takahashi et al, based on 
lattice  gauge  QCD,13  in  which  these  relations  between  coupling  constants  apply.  A 

 

40

constant term in the potential, as incorporated by these authors, would have no effect on 
the structure of the phase term, merely displacing the value used for E. 

The nilpotent structures may be used to suggest explanations of some aspects of the 
interaction of protons, as well as quarks. At intermediate distance, this interaction looks 
principally  like  the  exchange  of  a  single  gluon,  with  minor  adjustments  needed  to 
maintain  the  colour  singlet  state.  For  any  given  phase,  each  proton  will  always  be 
effectively represented as though by a single fermionic state, say (kE1 ± ii p1 + ij m1) and 
(kE2 ± ii p2 + ij m2). Now, the strong interaction between two such states, each in a single 
(though unspecified) phase, can be represented by a momentum transfer, which is exactly 
of the form involved in gluon exchange between the component parts of the proton. This 
will  also  be  still  beyond  the  threshold  at  which  the  Coulombic  or  scalar  part  of  the 
interaction dominates over the vector part. 

However, the interaction between protons within a nuclear-type structure (separation 
1 fm) is a saturated potential, of the form rn, where n ≤ 2, or polynomial combinations of 
that  form.  This  is  characteristic  of  a  dipolar  or  multipolar  force,  and,  of  course,  nuclear 
matter  exists  in  an  energy  regime  at  which  the  interacting  particle  is  a  strong-dipolar 
massive pion involved in the Coulombic or scalar part of the strong force, rather than the 
massless gluon exchange involved in the vector part. In effect, the pion is created because 
nuclear matter has undergone a phase transition, in which the weak force also plays a part, 
for the pion is a weak, as well as a strong dipole. The weak force appears to be involved 
generally  within  phase  transitions  because  it  is  fundamentally  dipolar,  in  response  to  its 
origin  within  the  pseudoscalar,  or  energy,  term  in  the  Dirac  nilpotent  state.  By  this,  we 
mean that the weak interaction creates a dipole between the fermion state and the vacuum 
(if the fermion states has no real partner), leading to spin ½ and zitterbewegung, and the 
weak  interaction,  as  a  uniquely  one-handed  force,  also  uniquely  has  a  dipole  moment, 
which is manifested through the spin. It is this dipole moment which is responsible for the 
tendency  of  fermions  to  structure  themselves  as  aggregated  matter,  finding  real,  rather 
than  vacuum,  partners  among  other  fermions  or  fermion-like  structures,  and  creating 
dipolarity  and  multipolarity  within  the  other  forces.  A  weak  interaction  between  two 
fermionic  sources  always  includes  the  vacuum  partner  as  the  other  dipole  component. 
Dipolar  /  multipolar  states  are  associated  with  harmonic  oscillator-type  regimes,  or 
creation and annihilation processes, and it is precisely such processes which are involved 
in the concept of phase transition. The pionic state is essentially a colour or strong singlet 
because of the necessity of making a bosonic state a weak singlet. 
 
21 The weak interaction: polynomial plus inverse linear potential 
 

Outside  of  the  two  special  cases  of  inverse  linear  and  linear  plus  inverse  linear 
potentials,  a  combination  of  any  other  polynomial  variation  (or  combination  of 
polynomial variations) with r plus inverse linear, with spherical symmetry, yields exactly 

 

41

the same solution: the harmonic oscillator. This is exactly what we would expect for the 
weak interaction, whose potential is fundamentally inverse cube plus inverse linear, in the 
basic  dipolar  form,  with  higher  inverse  orders  of  r  for  multipolar  cases.  (There  is  an 
intriguing  parallel  with  the  classical  case  of  planetary  perihelion  precession,  a 
combination  of  spin  and  orbital  motion  which  emerges  from  a  potential  of  exactly  the 
same  form,  also  derived  from  multipolar  sources.)  Let  us  assume  that  the  nilpotent 
operator can be written in the form

As  usual,  we  need  to  find  the  phase  which  will  make  the  amplitude  nilpotent. 
Polynomial  potential  terms  which  are  multiples  of  rn  require  the  incorporation  into  the 
exponential of terms which are multiples of rn+1. So, extending our work on the hydrogen 
atom and the strong interaction, we may suppose that the phase is of the form:

If,  in  the  case  of  the  weak  interaction,  we  associate  A,  the  phase  term  required  for 
spherical symmetry, with the random directionality of the fermion spin, we may assign to 
it a half-unit value (± ½ i), and obtain a set of energy levels of the form expected in the 
simple harmonic oscillator:

In  this  case,  the  phase  term,  with  its  unit  value  and  imaginary  coefficient,  will  be 
introduced  when  the  spin  component  is  added  to  the  σ.∇  term  in  transforming  from 
rectilinear  to  polar  coordinates.  There  may  be  some  significance  in  the  fact  that  the 
potential function may be assumed complex in certain circumstances, for this is the exact 
condition needed for CP violation which occurs, uniquely, in the weak interaction.  
 
22 Conclusion 
 

Redundancy  in  relativistic  quantum  mechanics  has  been  associated  with  the 
singularities produced when the momentum operator is treated mathematically in a way 
that makes it rotation asymmetric. This can be overcome by the use of an algebra which 
is fundamentally 3-dimensional. It then appears that the fragmentation of the momentum 
operator in the conventional representation is totally avoidable, leading to a much more 
coherent  picture  of  the  fermionic  state.  It  is  clear  from  this  procedure  that  much  of  the 
mathematical  apparatus  associated  with  the  Dirac  equation  is  totally  redundant.  In  the 
nilpotent  version  which  emerges,  there  is  only  a  one-line  operator,  which  has  the  same 
form whether the fermion is free or interacting. There is no need, in principle, to define a 
wavefunction, as the phase and amplitude is determined uniquely by the operator. There 
is  no  need,  in  addition,  to  define  either  operator  or  wavefunction  as  a  4-component 
spinor, as none of the terms is totally independent of the others. All we need to specify is 
that any product of two quaternionic fermionic states will always result in a scalar value, 
this being the only contribution made by the ‘4-component’ structure. In addition, there is 
only one phase, whether the system is fermionic, antifermionic or bosonic. Physically, of 
course,  the  quaternion  labels,  k,  i,  and  j,  which  provide  the  additional  ‘solutions’,  have 
multiple functions, which now can be seen to be related in a fundamental way. They are, 
respectively,  T,  P,  and  C  operators;  and  the  generators  of  weak,  strong,  and  electric 
vacua; they are also involved in the respective production of spin 1 bosons, Bose-Einstein 
condensates, and spin 0 bosons.

Many authors have applied geometrical and hypergeometrical algebras to the Dirac 
equation to make it easier to manipulate or more amenable to physical interpretation, with 
varying  degrees  of  success;  but  there  seems  to  be  only  one  approach  which  gives  a 
precise and exact solution to the fundamental problems of particle physics and relativistic 
quantum  mechanics,  and  it  requires  all  its  elements  in  exactly  the  right  place  before  it 
displays its full power. Ultimately, it would seem that the approach is also the simplest, 
its  defragmentation  of  the  Dirac  equation  making  analytic  calculation  in  significant 
examples  relatively  easy.  Relativistic  calculations 
than 
nonrelativistic  ones  because  all  the  elements  are  positioned  in  their  correct  places. 
Physical  interpretations  and  explanations  emerge  purely  from  the  nilpotent  structure. 
Preliminary work on the less tractable problems posed by aggregated matter suggests that 
it might have just as significant an effect in those areas as well.

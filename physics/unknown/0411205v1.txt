Abstract--The  radiation  hardness  of  the  AToM  chips  of  the 
BaBar  Silicon  Vertex  Tracker  has been investigated  by  means  of 
irradiations  with  photons  from  a  60Co  source  and  0.9  GeV 
electrons.  The  increase  in  noise  and  the  decrease  in  gain  of  the 
amplifier  have  been  measured  as  a  function  of  the  applied 
capacitive  load  and  the  absorbed dose. Different  beam  intensities 
have  been  used  to  study  the  effect  of  different  dose  rates  to  the 
AToM  radiation  damage.  The  chip  digital  functionalities  have 
been  tested up to a dose  of 5.5 Mrads for the  60Co photons and 9 
Mrads  for  the  0.9  GeV  electrons.  In  addition  a  pedestal  shift  for 
the  irradiated  channels  has  been  observed  in  the  test  with 
electrons  but  is  not  present  in  the  irradiation  with  photons.  This 
effect reproduces qualitatively the behavior observed since 2002 in 
the  front-end  electronics  of  the  installed  BaBar  Silicon  Vertex 
Tracker. After some investigation of the chip layout, this peculiar 
behavior  could  be  associated  to  radiation  damage  in  a  well-
identified  component  of  the  AToM.  The  results  of  the  radiation 
tests  are  presented  and  used  to  extrapolate  the  performance  and 
lifetime of the installed detector in the next few years. 

  

I.  INTRODUCTION 

T

HE  Silicon  Vertex  Tracker  (SVT)  of  the  BaBar 
experiment [1] at the PEP-II asymmetric B factory [2] is 
a  five  layer,  double  sided,  AC  coupled  silicon  microstrip 
detector. It is a crucial element for the precise measurement of 
the  decay  position  of  B  mesons,  satisfying  the  severe 
constraints  imposed  by  the  accelerator  design,  in  terms  of 
geometry of the interaction region and conditions of operation. 
In  exchange  for  a  noticeable  delivered  luminosity,  the 
integrated  dose  during  the  first  years  of  operation  is  much 
higher  than  what  expected  from  design:  this  is  a  reason  for 
concern,  which  recently  triggered  additional  studies  on  the 
SVT sensors and front-end electronics to determine the effects 
of radiation damage up to larger doses. The expected change in 
performance  with  radiation,  together  with  an  extrapolation  of

II.  IRRADIATION TESTS ON THE ATOM CHIP 

to 

One  of  the  SVT  components  which  are  expected  to  be  most 
sensitive  to  radiation  damage,  is  represented  by  the  front-end 
electronics.  The  AToM  ASIC  [3]  is  a  radiation  hard  chip 
produced by Honeywell in a 0.8 m m  CMOS process. The chip 
is  capable  of  simultaneous  signal  acquisition,  digitization  and 
sparsified  readout.  Information  is  shipped  out  about  the  hit 
timestamp  and  Time-Over-Threshold.  The  chip 
is  also 
equipped  with  a  mechanism  performing  internal  charge 
injection, used for periodic calibration, and a set of diagnostic 
tools.  Radiation  damage 
the  AToM  chip  has  been 
investigated  in  order  to  characterize  the  increase  in  noise  and 
decrease  in  gain  with  radiation  damage,  and  the  presence  of 
possible digital failures. In addition, channel pedestal offset has 
been  studied,  since  this  effect  has  been  observed  in  the 
installed system. 
The first irradiations of AToM chips on hybrid substrates have 
been performed at  SLAC and LBL using  photons from a  60Co 
source  with  doses  up  to  5  Mrads  followed  later  by  a 
measurement based on 0.9 GeV electrons at the Elettra LINAC 
(Trieste)  up  to  9  Mrads,  involving  also  a  full  inner-layer 
module with the chips bonded to the sensors. In the case of the 
run  with  photons,  to  irradiate  uniformly  all  the  elements,  the 
radiation was thermalized by means of an aluminum-lead box. 
During  all  the  tests  the  chips  were  powered,  cooled  and 
provided  with  an  external  clock  signal.  The  irradiations  were 
performed  in  several  steps  and  after  each  step  the  analog 
parameters  of  the  chips  (noise,  gain,  channel  pedestal)  were 
measured.  No  digital  failure  has  been  observed  in  any  of  the 
irradiated  chips.  The  noise  has  been  parameterized  with  two 
coefficients  to  model  the  dependence  on  the  capacitive  load: 
b Cload.The  measured  increase  in  the 
 = 
 
coefficients was 16%/Mrad and 19%/Mrad respectively, while 
the gain decreased by about 3%/Mrad (see Fig.1). These values 
are  in  very  good  agreement  with  the  increase  in  noise  and 
decrease  in  gain  observed  in  the  front  end  electronics  of  the 
installed  detector,  measured  from  the  calibrations  which  are 
performed daily with monitoring puroposes (see Fig.2).

Merging  together  the  information  coming  from  these  initial 
chip  irradiations  with  the  results  of  separate  studies  on  SVT 
sensors [4], the expected behavior of the signal over noise ratio 
has been extrapolated as a function of the dose (see Fig.3)

Using  a  figure  of  merit  of  about  10  for  the  S/N  ratio,  a 
reasonable  dose  budget  is  set  for  the  SVT  at  about  5  Mrads. 
This is not a  hard limit but more a scale of the dose at which 
the degradation of performance starts to become sizeable. 
Using  background  single-beam  and  collision  studies,  dose 
extrapolations can be extracted for the next few years, based on 
the  expected  beam  currents.  These  studies  indicate  that,  for 
modules  out  of  the  horizontal  plane,  the  5  Mrads  limit  will 
never be reached over the whole lifetime of the experiment. On 
the contrary, for modules in the middle plane, the degradation 
in  performance  will  start  to  appear  after  2006.  The  interested 
region is indeed limited to a narrow horizontal strip of 2-3 mm 
in the central part of the detector.   
 

III.  SHIFT IN CHANNEL PEDESTAL 

More recently, the scenario previously described was modified 
by the observation of a new effect. Since 2002, in the installed 
system,  we  are  experimenting  a  change  in  the  pedestal  of  the 
channels  of  the  central  chips in layer-1 and layer-2 horizontal 
modules (see Fig.4). The position corresponds to the area most 
affected  by  radiation  and  the  interested  chips  are  only  on  the 
west  side  of  the  detector,  the  side  affected  by  backgrounds 
from the High Energy beam.

Fig.4.   Channel pedestal distribution for a module in the horizontal plane, 

west side, at a dose of about 1.5 Mrad. 
 
This change was unexpected, since it was not observed during 
the 60Co irradiations. The gain and the noise of the chips are not 
deteriorated,  and  in  principle  it  is  possible  to  recover  the 
original  efficiency  by  a  threshold  adjustment.  As  a  matter  of 
fact,  this  is  only  partially  true.  If  the  pedestal  is  steadily 
increasing, the dynamic range of the possible threshold values 
is soon unusable. In addition, the pedestal distribution over the 
channels of a chip is rather wide, while a single threshold can 
be  set  for  the  whole  chip.  This  makes  the  efficiency 
optimization  very  difficult.  A  detailed  analysis  shows  that, 
when exposed to radiation, after an initial increase the pedestal 
of  each  channel  reaches  a  sort  of  plateau  and  then  starts  to 
decrease towards normal values (see Fig.5). Even if in practice

function of the integrated dose. 
 

 

 

this behavior seems to suggest that the short-term operation of 
the detector is not in danger, the long-term evolution needs to 
be  predicted  and  the  causes  of  the  process  need  to  be 
understood better.  
 

 

Fig. 5.  Pedestal evolution as a function of the dose for groups of channels 
of  one  of  the  affected  chips.  The  pedestal  increases  after  a  dose  of  about  1 
Mrad,  then  reaches  a  saturation  and  drops  back  towards  normal  values. 
Different groups of channels behave in a very similar way, even if they reach 
the corresponding doses at different times.  
 
Since the effect was not seen with photons and since the main 
background  component  at  PEP-II  is  known  to  be  from 
electromagnetic cascade, we decided to study the chip behavior 
during  irradiation  with  electrons  in  the  GeV  range.  The 
program  of  measurements was made using the Elettra LINAC 
(Trieste) in 2004. Chips loaded on a hybrid and on a full inner 
layer  module  have  been  irradiated.  An  x-y  stage  allowed  to 
move  the  sample  across  the  beam,  while  a  DAQ  system, 
providing power and clock, was used to run digital test during 
the  irradiation  and  to  provide  calibration  runs  between 
irradiation steps (see Fig.  6). No permanent digital failure has 
been observed up to a dose of 9 Mrad. 
 

was  made  on  a  single  chip  (chip  #2)  with  the  goal  of 
optimizing the LINAC beam current. A compromise was found 
between  the  need  to  reach  a  10  Mrads  dose  in  a  reasonable 
time  and  the  requirement  not  to  damage  the  chips  due  to  the 
instantaneous dose. The electron peak fluence rate selected for 
the irradiation was f
 = 3.75 x 1011 e-/cm2s, corresponding to a 
peak  dose  rate  of  about  10  Krad/s.  The  beam  size  was  s
beam= 
1.8mm.          
Using  the  selected  rate,  in  addition  to  the  chip  already 
irradiated,  a  scan  of  three  more  chips  loaded  on  the  High 
Density  Interconnect  (Chip  #3,4,5)  was  performed.  This 
allowed to reach an integrated dose of about 9 Mrads on chip 
#2  and  about  3.2  Mrads  on  the  others.  The  channel  pedestal 
distribution  changed  during  the  irradiation,  showing  the 
expected drift, at least in a qualitative way (see Fig.7) 
 

   

Fig. 7.  Pedestal change after 3.2 Mrads for the irradiated chips. The beam 
path across the four irradiated chips is sketched in the upper figure. There are 
128 channels for each chip. The profile of the beam scan is clearly visible in 
the  plot  showing  the  pedestal  change  after  the  irradiation.  The  left  and  right 
plots are the chips on the n-side and p-side of the High Density Interconnect. 
 
The evolution of pedestal is shown in Fig.8. The drift is rather 
fast at the beginning, then the pedestal reaches a plateau. When 
the  irradiation  is  suspended  there  is  some  annealing  effect, 
after which the drift continues when the irradiation is resumed. 
Again, saturation is achieved.

pedestal  reaches  a  plateau.  During  the  night  stop,  the  pedestal  shows  some 
annealing  effect  (center  part  of  the  plot).  When  irradiation  is  resumed,  the 
pedestal  reaches  a  saturation.  The  last  point  was  taken  after  a  15  days-
annealing 
 

 

 

 

After  the  HDI,  also  the  chips  loaded  on  a  inner  layer  module 
were  irradiated  up  to 6  Mrads.  The results are very  similar to 
what obtained on the HDI (see Fig.9)

module.  The  beam  path  across  the  four  irradiated  chips  is  sketched  in  the  
figure.  Again,  the  profile  of  the  beam  scan  is  clearly  visible  in  terms  of 
pedestal variation.  
 
No  gain  or  noise  variation  has  been  observed  in  the 
calibrations,  and  this  has  been  confirmed  by  measurements 
taken after the irradiation, generating charge inside the silicon 
by a 1060nm LED.  
The  pedestal  variation  as  a  function  of  the  dose  (see  Fig.10) 
shows a distribution similar to what measured in the case of the 
HDI.  After  an  initial  variation,  the  pedestal  approaches 
saturation. A clear annealing effect is visible at the end of the 
irradiation. 
 

 

 
Fig. 10.  Pedestal change as a function of dose for the chips of the inner layer 
module. Also here, after an  initial increase, the pedestal reaches a saturation. 
At  the  end  of  the  irradiation  there  is  a  clear  annealing  effect.  The  last  point 
was taken 15 days after the end of the measurements. 
 
One more chip (Chip #4) has been irradiated at a lower rate, to 
investigate a possible dependence of the effect on the dose rate. 
No difference was seen with respect to the other chips.  

IV.  COMPARISON WITH THE INSTALLED SYSTEM AND 
INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS 

The  behavior  shown  by  the  chips  irradiated  at  Elettra  is 
presenting  a  number  of  common  features  to  what  observed  in 

the  real  experiment.  There  is  indeed  some  quantitative 
difference.  The  maximum  pedestal  deviation  during  the  test 
was of the order of about 15 counts, corresponding to about 1/6 
MIP. In the real system, the saturation was reached at about 25 
counts  (see  Fig.5).  The  difference  can  be  attributed  to  the 
necessarily  fast  rate  at  which  the  dose  has  been  delivered 
during  the  test,  which  is  orders  of  magnitude  larger  with 
respect  to  the  PEP-II  interaction  region.  Some  instantaneous 
damage  saturation  is  likely  to  be  the  cause  of  the  observed 
quantitative discrepancy. On the contrary, in the irradiation, the 
residual  pedestal  shift  after  the  annealing  effect  is  about  5-8 
counts, and the same change is present in the real experiment, 
after the pedestal goes down towards normal values. In spite of 
the  numerical  discrepancies,  the  main  achievement  of  the  test 
has been to determine that the observed shift in pedestal can be 
obtained  with  an  electromagnetic  cascade,  the  same  nature  of 
the  main  background  component  present  in  the  PEP-II 
interaction  region.  The  irradiation,  pushed  to  9  Mrads,  gave 
indication  that  the  evolution  of  the  shift  is  not  expected  to 
represent a danger for the SVT operation even in the long-term 
perspective.   
Even  if  the  shift  of  the  threshold  voltage  with  radiation  is  a 
known  effect  for  sample  CMOS  structures,  special  attention 
had  been  put  in  the  design  and  layout  of  the  AToM  chip  to 
prevent  this  problem.  In  particular,  extensive  use  of  mirrored 
components  had  been  made,  to  mitigate  the  effects  of 
temperature changes and radiation damage. Given the result of 
the  test  beam,  the  schematics  of  the  AToM  chip  have  been 
investigated  to  search  for  a  possible  weakness  in  the  design. 
The  analysis  has  shown  the  presence  of  two  possible  weak 
points, one in the shaper and one in the comparator, where the 
principle  has  not  been  respected.  Detailed  simulations  are 
underway to study the effect in more detail.  
 

V.       CONCLUSIONS 

We  have  characterized  the  radiation  hardness  of  the  BaBar 
SVT AToM front-end chips to extrapolate the lifetime and the 
expected reduction in performance. We used  60Co sources and 
electrons in the GeV range. A radiation budget of 5 Mrads has 
been set; this dose will never be reached by the SVT modules 
out of the horizontal plane, while will be reached after 2006 by 
the  central  part  of  the  modules  in  the beam bending plane. In 
addition,  an  unexpected  effect  has  been  observed  in  the 
installed  detector,  consisting  in  a  drift  of  the  pedestal  of  the 
channels  more  exposed  to  radiation.  After  an  initial  increase 
the  pedestal  reaches  a  level  of  saturation  and  then  decreases 
down  towards  normal  values.  We  were  able  to  reproduce  the 
drift  after  irradiation  with  0.9  GeV  electrons  and  we  have 
indication  that  we  understood  the  cause.  During  the  test  an 
integrated dose of about 9 Mrads was reached in order to study 
the  long-term  evolution  of  the  effect  and  to  exclude  that  the 
behavior could show a critical trend for the system operation in 
the future.

We  enrich  the  configuration  space  of  classical  physics  with  additional  co-ordinates 

(particle  state  vectors)  transformed  by  local  Lorentz  and  Yang-Mills  groups  of 

particle  interactions.  We  reformulate  geodesics  equations  in  terms  of  the  parallel 

transfer  of  the  particle  state  vector  and  show  that  distance  on  a  manifold  can  be 

determined as an eigenvalue of a suitably chosen distance one-form. A procedure of 

distance  measurement  is  revised  and  shown  to  be  consistent  with  the  proposed 

approach. Various examples of the distance form are given. We formulate the action 

principle based on the distance form and apply it to classical particles with spin. It is 

suggested that the distance form of our space-time is scaled with a Weyl-Higgs field.

I. Introduction. 

 

 

 

The purpose of this paper is to discuss a generalization of classical physics that will 

incorporate  local  symmetries  of  recognized  interactions.  We  achieve  the  goal  by 

studying  geodesics  and  distance  in  space-time  of  classical  objects.  In  this  paper  we 

restrict  ourselves  to  classical  physics  of  particles  which  behaviour  is  defined  by  a 

local state associated with a particle “singularity”. 

The concept of distance in space-time is of paramount importance and there exists a 

vast  amount  of  literature  devoted  to  the  subject.  For  this  reason,  it  is  virtually 

impossible to mention all authors who studied metrical relations of space-time; the list 

is long and contains many prominent scientists and philosophers like Zeno, Aristotle, 

Hume, Newton, Leibniz, Lobachevsky, Gauss, Riemann, Einstein, Minkowski, Weyl, 

Ashtekar and many others. In this light it seems natural to avoid a usual introduction 

where a significance of the problem under study is explained. Also, in the following 

we accept a practice of minimum citation and apologize beforehand to anyone whose 

work has not been cited. 

We begin with a brief summary of the paper. The starting point of our analysis is the 

fact  that  structureless  material  points  of  classical  Newton’s  physics  should  not 

interact:  they  do not posses internal qualities  responsible for their  interactions.  As  a 

result,  a  classical  force  is  an  ad  hoc  addition  into  a  structure  of  Newton’s  classical 

physics.  To  incorporate  a  force  into  classical  physics  using  geometrical  tools  one 

requires  additional 

internal  particle  co-ordinates  connected  with  particular 

interactions.  We  assume  that  these  additional  co-ordinates  are  state  vectors  φ  

transforming  by  representations  of  local  Lorentz  and  Yang-Mills  symmetry  groups. 

Hence,  we  enlarge  the  configuration  space  of  a  classical  particle  from  a  co-tangent 

fibre bundle (x, p), where x give the particle position and p is particle momentum, to a 

fibre bundle described by the local co-ordinates (x,  φ ), where x are usual space-time 

co-ordinates and  φ  are the additional ones. On this basis we reformulate geodesics 

in terms of the parallel transport of the particle state vector  φ  (instead of the parallel 

transfer of a tangent vector). This definition of geodesics suggests that distance on a 

3 

manifold,  ds,  can  be  found  as  an  eigenvalue  of  the  canonical  distance  form  ˆθ: 

ˆ(
θ

)dx

φ

φ=
ds

.  Hence,  the  quadratic  metric  form  can  be  replaced  by  a  linear 

operator  one-form  which  determines  the  same  metrical  relations  as  the  metric  form 

and has an analogy with a linear Finsler’s metric. The action principle based on the 

distance  form  readily  gives  a  description  of  classical  particles  with  spin  subject  to 

Yang-Mills forces. The particle state  φ  replaces the classical particle momentum in 

this description.  It is shown that motion of spinor particles is affected by the space-

time curvature. We also write a canonical distance form of space-time with additional 

co-ordinates  transformed  by  the  local  Yang-Mills  group  of  the  standard  model  of 
electroweak  interactions  G=SU(3)×SU(2)L×U(1)Y  which  may  be  used  to  describe  a 

classical electron. 

The  paper  is  constructed  as  follows.  In  the  Section  II  we  consider  the  definition  of 

geodesics for particles which states are transformed by local Lorentz and Yang-Mills 

symmetries.  We  write  the  linear  canonical  form  as  an  operator  in  the  representation 

space  (a  distance  form)  and  show  how  it  can  be  used  to  determine  metric  relations. 

The  analysis  of  the  Section  II  is  performed  mostly  in  mathematical  terms.  In  the 

Section III we provide physical arguments in favour of the distance form. We discuss 

the  procedure  of  distance  measurements  in  classical  physics  and  propose  to  use 

particles instead of light for measuring small separations. Using the identity principle 

we  validate  the  geodesics  definition  of  the  Section  II.  Examples  of  the  canonical 

distance forms are given in the Section IV. In the Section V we formulate a variation 

principle  compatible  with  the  proposed  geodesics  equations.  We  show  why  two 

definitions  of  geodesics  (based  on  the  parallel  transport  and  the  minimal  distance) 

coincide.  The  variation  principle  allows  us  to  describe  classical  particles  with  spin 

subject to Yang-Mills forces.  The distance form  of a space-time  with additional co-

ordinates  of  the  electroweak  theory  is  proposed  in  the  Section  VI  and  is  used  to 

describe  motion  of  a  classical  electron.  Finally,  the  conclusion  is  given  and  the 

distance form in the space of a Lie group is introduced in the Appendix. 

II. Geodesics definition based on a canonical distance form. 

 

 

 

4 

We start with a reformulation of the geodesic equations. Traditionally  geodesics are 

defined through a parallel transport of a tangent vector in a linear (affine) connection. 

(Another  definition  is  based  on  the  fact  that  a  geodesic  line  is  the  shortest  curve 

connecting two points on a manifold and will be discussed in Section V.) Two one-

forms  are  required  to  write  the  geodesic  equation  [1,2].  One  is  the  connection  form 

ω ω=
i

j

iE

j

 (where 

iE  constitute a basis of the algebra Lie of a linear group) of the 

j

linear  connection  ∇.  The  connection  form  ω  describes  how  frames  (and  tangent 

i

vectors) rotate during displacements. The second is the canonical form of a manifold 
ieθ θ=
forms  of  the  linear  connection).  The  canonical  form  of  the  linear  connection  θ 

  (where  ei  are  basis  vectors  of  the  tangent  space  and 

iθ   are  canonical  one-

connects  the  space  of  tangent  vectors  u  with  displacements  on  the  manifold  δx  and 

produces a curve on the manifold. The geodesic equations are

(1) implies that the tangent vector is transported parallel along the geodetic curve. The 

second  equation  of  the  system  (1)  determines  a  displacement  on  the  manifold  for  a 

specific value of the tangent vector, or, in other words, solders the manifold with the 

tangent  space.  For  natural  coordinates  xi  we  have

This  formulation  of  the  geodesic  equation  is  not  satisfactory.  It  presents  a  point  of 

view  of  Newtonian  physics  where  objects  are  supposed  to  be  structureless  material 

points  characterised  by  their  position  only.  However,  it  is  well  known  that  physical 

objects  are  not  just  material  points.  Various  experiments  clearly  show  that  physical 

objects possess other degrees of freedom which are transformed by representations of 

the Lorentz group and Yang-Mills group of local symmetry and required to describe 

particle  interactions.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  reformulate  geodesic  equations  in 

terms of representations of these groups. From this point onwards we suppose that the 

configuration  space  of  classical  physics  is  a  fibre  bundle  with  local  co-ordinates  (x, 

φ ), where x are the space-time co-ordinates and  φ  are state vectors transforming 

by representations of local Lorentz and Yang-Mills symmetries. 

First,  we  rewrite  the  geodesic  equations  in  terms  of  an  orthogonal  group  of 

orthonormal  frame  rotations.  (For  4-fold  manifolds  with  a  metric  of  the  Lorentz 

signature the orthogonal group is the Lorentz group of tetrad rotations that generates 

spinor representations of physical particles.) To perform this task we have to reduce 

the linear connection of arbitrary frames to the linear connection of the orthonormal 

frame  rotations  since  only  orthonormal  frames  support  the  action  of  the  orthogonal 

group.  (This  requires  compatibility  of  the  linear  connection  with  the  metric  on  the 

manifold [1,2].) Let ea be a section of orthogonal frames so that

We describes the particle state using representation vector  φ  assigned to the particle 

position so that

of  geodesics  φ   is  the  tangent  vector  u  assigned  to  a  particle  position  on  the 

manifold).  Then,  the  first  equation  of  the  system  (1)  has  a  straightforward 

generalisation to a representation of an orthogonal group

ˆ

T dT−

(or  zero  if  the  equivalence  group  is  trivial).  An  equivalence  group,  by  definition, 

transforms  a  state  vector  into  a  vector  that  describes  the  same  physical  state.  For 

linear  connection,  for  example,  different  parallel  tangent  vectors  represent  the  same 

direction on the manifold. As a result, the parallel transfer (1) includes the multiplier 
δλ  that  reflects  the  sense  of  parallelism  (two  vectors  are  parallel  if  they  are 

proportional). Similarly, it is often accepted that all vectors  exp(

iα φ  represent the 

)

same physical state. Then, the Lie algebra of this Abelian group is 

1ˆ
ˆ
−
T dT

=

 and 

the  right  hand  side  of  (3)  is  iδαφ .  There  could  be  some  other  agreement  on 

equivalence  of  particle  states  and  the  equivalence  group  could  be  more  complex. 

However, since all vectors produced by the action of the equivalence group represent 

the same physical state, we can reduce the right hand side of (3) to zero by changing 

the calibration of the representation vector. This calibration is used for the rest of the 

paper.  Equation  (3)  simply  tells  that  any  vector  object  associated  with  a  geodesic 

curve should be transported parallel along it and is valid for representations of a local 

Yang-Mills group as well.  

 

The difficulty lies with the second equation of the geodesic system (1) (that calculates 

the direction and magnitude of the displacement on a manifold for a specific value of 

the  tangent  vector).  This  equation  cannot  be  formulated  in  terms  of  representation 

vectors: 

in  general  case, 

there 

is  no  one-to-one  correspondence  between 

representation  vectors  φ   and  displacements  on  manifold  (as  it  is  for  tangent 

vectors).  It  has  to  be  said  that  the  second  equation  of  the  geodesic  system  (1)  is 

intuitively obvious to such degree that many textbooks take it for  granted and write 

geodesic equations straight in the form (2). However, it is not necessarily evident. It 

relates two entities of completely different geometrical nature: one is a displacement 

on  the  manifold  (a  non-local  property)  and  the  other  is  a  tangent  vector  (a  local 

property).  There  is  a  long-standing  discussion  among  mathematicians  about  a 

possibility  to  identify  the  tangent  space  of  a  manifold  with  the  manifold  itself.  The 

tangent vectors, despite being generated by classes of an equivalence of curves on the 

7 

manifold, are new geometrical objects and lie outside manifold (with an exception of 

a  zero  vector  corresponding  to  stationary  curves).  The  second  equation  of  (1), 

nonetheless, relates small tangent vectors with small displacements on the manifold. 

An  agreement  has  been  reached  that  this  can  be  justified  for  a  manifold  embedded 

with its tangent space into a manifold of a higher dimension with a metric. However, 

in general case, the tangent space is a space of derivations [2] and is not automatically 

related  to  displacements  on  the  underlying  manifold.  Physicists  deal  with  the  same 

problem formulated in different terms. A definition of an instant velocity (the tangent 

vector)  based  on  space-time  displacements  is  elusive  [4].  It  is  not  clear  what  time 

interval one needs to watch an object in order to deduce its instant velocity from its 

motion in space-time nor what is the point of space-time which this instant velocity 

belongs  to.  For  these  reasons,  we  believe  that  the  second  equation  of  (1)  is  not  of 

geometrical nature and has to be amended in order to describe geodesics in terms of 

spinor representations.  

 

 

 

To  find  a  correct  relation  between  displacements  on  a  manifold  and  representation 

vectors  we  note  that  representation  operators  are  the  only  geometric  objects  at  our 

disposal. A fundamental property of a (physical) operator is a set of its eigenvectors 

lying in the representation space. Thus, an operator valued one-form (which maps a 

displacement  to  a  space  of  operators)  would  establish  a  mapping  of  a  manifold 

displacement  to  eigenvectors  of  a  corresponding  operator.  This  mapping  is 

multivalued  since  different  eigenvectors  may  correspond  to  the  same  displacement. 

However,  being  taken  with  equation  (3),  this  correspondence  may  lead  to  a  unique 

curve in the fibre bundle associated with the representation and yield a geodesic as a 

projection of this curve. 

For concreteness, we consider the lowest spinor representation  ψ  of the orthogonal 

group (the generalization to higher representations is straightforward). It is known that 

a spinor representation possesses a set of  ˆa

γ  matrices with property

provides  a  desired  relation  between  displacements  and  the  representation  vectors.

(8) 

is sufficient for (7) to be compatible and to have a solution. Indeed, (8) means that the

of the system (7). Vice versa, if the system (7) has a solution it satisfies (8) and hence 

projects onto a geodesic. 

Since operator-valued one-form  ˆθ is transformed by the adjont representation of the

orthogonal  group  (in  accordance  with  the  adjoint  representation  of  ˆa

the  square  root  from  the  metric  two-form.  In  the  coordinate  basis  the  form  ˆθ  is

The formulae (11), (12) are not surprise because the metric form g also defines these 

geometric  properties.  They  mean,  however,  that  the  connection  distance  form  ˆθ  is 

enough to recover basic properties of the linear connection on a manifold. 

 

 

 

Using  Infeld-van  der  Waerden  symbols  [5],  we  can  construct  the  distance  form  for 

any representation produced by the direct product of spinor representations (provided 

the product of these representations with the vector representation contains the trivial 

representation), 

e.g., 

for  massive  particles  described  by 

an 

equation

distance. Hence, the system (7) with 

γ = Γ  and an appropriate connection form  ˆω 
ˆa

ˆ

will give geodesics. 

To  summarize,  the  definition  of  geodesics  in  a  fibre  bundle  of  an  orthogonal  group 

associated with  φ -representation can be given as follows: geodesic is a curve such 

that the parallel transport of the initial representation vector  φ  to any point along 

the  curve  yields  an  eigenvector  of  the  operator-valued  distance  form  ˆ( )xθ (cid:5)   taken  at 

this point (in accordance with the original definition where a geodesics is defined as 

the curve such that the parallel transport of a tangent vector gives a displacement on 

the manifold via canonical forms 

iθ ). Since both  ˆθ and the covariant derivative  ∇  

are transformed by the  adjoint representation of the orthogonal group, the definition 

(7)  does  not  depend  upon  the  calibration  (a  local  section  of  the  fibre  bundle  of  the 

orthogonal group associated with the representation). The eigenvalues of the distance 

form  coincide  with  the  metric  generated  distance.  This  will  allow  us  to  formulate 

geodesics as curves of minimal lengths, see the Section V.  

It  is  clear  that  the  geodesic  definition  (7)  is  obviously  valid  when  φ   is  also 

transformed by a Yang-Mills group commuting with the local orthogonal group. 

III. Physical arguments for a distance form. 

In  this  section  we  present  physical  arguments  for  the  case  that  distance  should  be 

regarded as an eigenvalue of a suitably chosen distance one-form operator. First, we 

make  a  trivial  observation  that  empty  space  does  not  possess  any  metrical  relations 

relevant to physics. It is evident that some phenomena are required to mark points of 

space-time  and  deduce  distances  between  them.  Thus,  being  a  good  hypothetic 

background to the Newton’s theory, a concept of empty space-time cannot be applied 

to the real world. It is widely accepted that our world possesses coordinates additional 

12 

to space and time and these coordinates describe physical phenomena that happens in 

the  world.  At  the  present  state  of  knowledge  we  associate  these  coordinates  with 

particles and fields. We assume that every point of our space-time has its own copy of 

additional coordinates, which allows us to treat the world as a fibre bundle. The base 

of  this  fibre  bundle  is  a  four-dimensional  space-time  which  is  an  arena  of  the  low-

energy  physics.  The  fibres  are  the  additional  coordinates  that  can  be  imagined  as 

representations  of  the  local  symmetry  group.  It  is  supposed  that  locally  physics  is 

simple  and  the  fibre  space  from  one  point  of  space-time  can  be  connected  with  the 

fibre of an adjacent point by means of a linear connection. System dynamics does not 

depend upon the way in which additional coordinates are parameterised, which finds 

its  reflection  in  gauge  invariance  of  all  measured  quantities.  There  are  different 

opinions to what are particles and what are fields in this picture. In classical physics 

we suppose that fields are connections in the world fibre bundle. As a result, fields are 

treated as local objects which are characterised by field potentials (local functions of 

space-time  coordinates).  Particles  are  supposed  to  be  non-trivial  states  of  the  world 

fibre bundle, which are described by globally non-trivial connections. Since any non-

trivial  state  of  the  world  fibre  bundle  is  accompanied  by  non-trivial  connections,  it 

means that a (classical) particle is surrounded by fields associated with it. An electron, 

for example, is surrounded by an electromagnetic field. This implies that particles are 

non-local objects.  

Many  scientists  realised  that  the  metric  properties  of  space-time  should  be  deduced 

from properties of constituent matter. However, it required Einstein’s genius to show 

how physical phenomena can be used to measure point separations in space-time [6]. 

Einstein  utilised  light  signals  (photons)  for  space-time  mapping  and  measuring 

distances. His light signal procedure works very well for sufficiently large distances. 

However, measurements of small separations with the help of photons is hindered by 

the  finite  wavelength  of  the  light  and  by  the  problem  of  the  photon  creation  and 

absorption  in  small  space-time  regions.  It  is  very  unlikely  that  a  very  small  photon 

emitter  and  receiver  can  be  fabricated.  This  means  that  small  distances  cannot  be 

measured  with  the  help  of  light  signals  and  hence  there  is  a  necessity  to  revise  the 

procedure of distance measurement. 

 

 

13 

The  only  alternatives  to  massless  photons  (for  mapping  and  measuring  space)  are 

massive  particles.  Despite  we  do  not  know  an  internal  structure  of  elementary 

particles, we believe that a massive particle has some sort of singularity which is well 

localised  in  space.  This  singularity  may  be  used  to  probe  space-time  with  better 

resolution  than  that  achieved  with  light  signals.  Again,  we  can  dismiss  any  direct 

distance  measurement  procedure  associated  with  the  creation  of  a  particle  at  some 

point of space-time and its annihilation at some other point for the same difficulty of 

fabrication  of  very  small  particle  emitters  and  absorbers.  As  a  result,  for  probing 

space-time with high resolution, we are forced to use indirect procedures based on a 

change  of  a  state  of  an  already  existing  or  specially  prepared  particle.  Indeed,  an 

information  about  the  particle  state  and  position  can  be  obtained  by  recording  the 

particle fields with the help of a macroscopic apparatus placed sufficiently far away 

from  the  region  where  the  distance  is  being  assessed.  For  example,  in  classical 

physics we can determine the position of an electron by measuring its electromagnetic 

field  in  several  different  points  of  space-time  sufficiently  far  from  the  electron 

location. 

 

Therefore,  it  seems  natural  to  consider  the  following  procedure  for  distance 

determination: we prepare a physical particle that travels from a given point of space-

time to a neighbouring point and deduce the distance between these two close points 

by  measuring  the  fields  produced  by  the  particle  with  the  help  of  a  macroscopic 

apparatus. We need only to specify what does the particle preparation consist of. It is 

evident  that  once  we  refuse  to  consider  particles  as  structureless  material  points  we 

allow  a  particle  to  transform  during  its  motion.  There  are  two  basic  types  of 

transformations. One type is formed by passive transformations which come from an 

agreement on “what is  what” in a fibre space over a fixed point of the manifold.  In 

mathematical terms this agreement means freedom to choose any point of a fibre as 

the beginning of additional coordinates, or, in other words, freedom of gauge fixing. 

Another type of transformations consists of active transformations which are related 

to a real change of physical particles. An electron, e.g., can emit photons, photons can 

generate electron-positron pairs, etc. So, we formulate the basic (identity) principle of 

the particle preparation for distance measurement: a particle should stay in the same 

state during the act of measurement. This identity principle ensures that we observe 

the same test particle during an entire act of measurement and hence possible “stray” 

14 

particles do not influence our results. Also, this principle guarantees that the change 

of the world fibre bundle (due to the presence of the particle) will be the same in the 

beginning  and  in  the  end  of  measurement.  (The  presence  of  a  physical  particle 

influences the state of the world fibre bundle. The identity principle ensures that this 

influence is homogeneous.) 

 

 

 

 

In mathematical terms the identity principle for distance measurement with respect to 

passive  transformations  means  that  the  state  of  the  particle  should  be  conserved  in 

process of measurement, so that observers in different points of space-time can agree 

that they “see” the same particle from the point of view of gauge fixing: 

0φ∇

= , 

(13) 

where  φ   is  the  particle  state  and  ∇   is  the  connection  for  this  particle  state.  With 

respect to active particle transformations the identity principle implies that the particle 

state  should  be  an  eigenstate  of  some  distance  operator  ˆ(

L dx   (the  measurement 

)i

should not change the physical state of the particle): 

ˆ(
L dx

)i

dφ λφ=

. 

(14) 

This  is  as  far  as  we  can  go  without  describing  the  particles  state  φ .  In  general, 

particles (combined with accompanying fields) are non-local objects. Yet, for distance 

measurement, we need to associate a particle state to some point in space-time. A way 

to  do  that  in  classical  physics  is  to  attribute  a  representation  vector  to  the  place  of 

particle singularity (where the fields are “diverging”). The main argument in favour of 

this is based on the fact that the measured distance should not depend on the internal 

structure of the probing particle and should not change if we “simplify” the structure 

of  the  particle  to  a  local  representation  vector.  Then,  φ   will  be  a  vector  of  a 

representation  of  an  orthogonal  group  and  the  equation  (13)  will  correspond  to  the 

first equation of the geodetic system (7). For the distance operator  ˆ(

L dx  we argue 

)i

that the linear operator (6) is the simplest one that gives distance consistent with the 

Riemann metric. 

In  conclusion  to  this  section,  we  stress  again  that  metrical  relations  (in  the  physical 

world)  should  be  deduced  from  properties  of  constituent  matter.  Since  particles  and 

fields  are  the  only  ingredients  of  the  contemporary  physics  and  it  is  highly  unlikely 

15 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that  fields  can  be  used  for  measuring  small  separations,  distance  should  be  directly 

related to some properties of physical particles. This forces us to suggest that distance 

is given by  eigenvalues  of some distance one-form instead of the conventional two-

form acting on the tangent space. 

The  fact  that  distance  is  an  eigenvalue  of  a  distance  operator  does  not  necessarily 

mean  quantisation  of  distance  and  volume.  In  this  classical  picture  it  rather  implies 

that  we  have  to  prepare  the  measuring  apparatus  (elementary  particles  used  for 

distance measurement) before making a conclusion about separation of two points in 

space-time.  The  quantum  mechanics  will  probably  require  more  complex  particle 

states and complex distance operators.  

We should be able to choose any stable physical particle for distance measurements 

(the same ratios of separations should be measured by different particles). However, 

from  the  practical  point  of  view,  leptons  (electrons)  are  the  best  candidates  for  the 

length definition because of long-range electromagnetic fields that surrounds them. 

IV. Examples of the canonical distance form. 

 Three-dimensional Euclid space, n = 3, metric signature (+,+,+).  

The  two-component  spinors  realise  the  lowest  spinor  representation  in  three-

dimensions. The canonical distance form in the spinor representation is 

where  ˆa

σ   (a  =  1,2,3)  are  the  Pauli  matrices.  They  satisfy  the  well-known  relation

In

there  exists  a  one-to-one 

correspondence between direction of motion on the manifold and the canonical form

(up 

to

factor).

This  correspondence  is  directly  connected  with  the  possibility  to  pack  the  distance 

form  into  the  Lie  algebra  of  the  orthogonal  group.  In  general  case,  the  canonical 

distance  form  and  the  generators  of  the  Lie  algebra  of  an  orthogonal  group  lie  in 
γ  
different  sub-spaces  of  the  Clifford  algebra:  one  sub-space  is  generated  by  ˆa

Four-dimensional Lorentz space-time, n = 4, metric signature (+,-,-,-).

In 

four-dimensions 

the  spinor 

representation  is  a  direct  sum  of  two  irreducible  representations  of  the  orthogonal 

group  ψ χ η

= ⊕ ,  where  χ  is  transformed  under  (1/2,0)  and  η  is  transformed  by 

(0,1/2)  representations  of  the  orthogonal  group  [5].  We  shall  use  the  following

and the left and right components of the Dirac bi-spinor. Since  ψ  is the direct sum 

of  two  irreducible  components,  the  distance  form  (the  canonical  form  in  the  spinor 

representation)  is  also  a  direct  sum  of  two  operator-valued  one-forms  connecting

where  χ  is  any  normalised  spinor.  The  freedom  to  choose  any  state  of  χ  while 

determining  the  distance  reflects  the  fact  that  (spinor)  particle  representations  in  4 

dimensions possess spin degrees of freedom. 

In this case the canonical distance form cannot be packed into the Lie algebra of the 

orthogonal group (or, in other words, we cannot define the distance form in the space 

of the principal fibre bundle, where fibres are the group transformations). Indeed, the 

generators of the Lie algebra in 4-dimensions are transformed under the  (1,0)

(0,1)

 

representation while the displacement one-forms 

aθ  are transformed under the vector 

(1/2,1/2) representation. Hence, the direct product of generators and the displacement 

forms decomposes onto a sum of some spinor representations and does not result in a 

trivial scalar representation which can be attributed to scalar classical distance.

  is  the  metric  distance.  This  implies  that  (22)  is 

extremised  when  the  metric  distance  along  the  curve 

x τ   is  extremised,  which  is 
( )

another definition of geodesics. This helps us to clarify why two different definitions 

of geodesics (as being a parallel transport of a representation vector and a minimum 

distance curve) coincide. Indeed, it was proven that the distance form  ˆθ is transported 

parallel  along  geodesics,  see  (8).  Hence,  the  parallel  transport  of  a  representation 

vector 

φ  minimising the distance  dλ at the beginning of the curve will minimise 

0

the distance form at any point of the geodetic curve. So, the action (22) connects two 

definitions  of  geodesics  together  –  it  generates  the  parallel  transport  of  the 

representation  vector  (as  in  (7))  and  the  parallel  transport  of  the  canonical  distance 

form, which automatically minimizes the metric distance along the geodetic curve. 

The action (22) has a defect: it requires an additional constraint of the parallel transfer 

of  the  particle  state 

0φ∇

= .  Also,  the  action  (22)  contains  no  contribution  from 

Yang-Mills  fields.  Even  in  the  presence  of  non-trivial  Yang-Mills  potentials  (which 
affect the covariant derivative  ∇ ), the particle of (22) will follows geodesics. A more 

reasonable  action  for  the  classical  particle  (

x τ , φ ),  whose  representation  vector

The actions (22), (24) illustrate the fact that the velocity of the  Lagrange formalism 

can  be  replaced  by  a  (spinor)  representation  vector  as  a  simple  alternative  to 

momentum  of  the  Hamilton’s  formalism.  W.  Hamilton  was  the  first  to  replace  non-

local  velocities  determined  by  motion  on  the  manifold  by  well-defined  local 

=

∂
L
∂(cid:5)
x

momentum  p.  Using  the  fact  that  the  momentum  definition 

p

  minimises  the 

Lagrange  transformation  px L−(cid:5)

,  where  L  is  the  Lagrange  function,  he  was  able  to 

treat  momentum  as  independent  variables.  In  case  of  the  discussed  action,  this 

Lagrange  property  holds  due  to  the  fact  that  the  representation  vector  φ   is  an 

eigenvalue  of  the  corresponding  Lagrangian  and,  as  a  result,  also  extremises  the 

action. We were successful in writing (22), (24) mainly because the non-local group 

of  general  coordinate transformations was replaced by  a local  group of orthonormal 

frame rotations with the spinor representations. 

 
It  is  worth  mentioning  that  the  Lagrange  multiplier  χ  of  the  classical  action  (24) 

(which can be made constant by changing the curve calibration, see above) scales the 

“dynamical”  part  of  the  action  and  plays  the  role  of  the  Plank  constant  of  quantum 

theory [8]. There are other parallels between the classical dynamics in (

x τ , φ ) and 
( )

quantum  mechanics.  For  example,  the  same  direction  of  motion  may  correspond  to 

different  states  of  the  moving  particle  (of  different  spin  directions).  A  linear 

transformation  of  particle  states  φ   at  some  space-time  points  (with  the  help  of  a 

classical  apparatus)  will  split  particle  motion  make  possible  particle  interference.  It 

remains to be seen if such a classical theory will be consistent with quantum theory. 

VI.  The  canonical  distance  form  for  spaces  with  the  Yang-Mills  group  of  the 

Standard Model. 

In  case of the  four-dimensional  Lorentz space-time (which is an  area of  low energy 

particles and fields) the distance form is given by  ˆ

θ γθ=
a
ˆ
a

(or (19)) and the lowest bi-

spinor  representation  consists  of  the  direct  sum  of  the  left  and  right  components. 

Mathematically,  geodesics  equation  (7)  represent  the  same  geodesics  as  the  original 

geodesics  equation  (2)  provided  the  Yang-Mills  group  of  the  local  symmetry  acts 

identically on the left and right components. However, due to overwhelming success 

of  the  Weinberg-Salam  theory  of  electroweak  interactions,  we  believe  that  the  local 

symmetry group acts differently on left and right components of the orthogonal group. 

There  exist  very  strong  indications  that  the  left  components  transform  as  SU(2) 
α
, α=1,2) while the right components are SU(2) singlets (R). For example, 
doublets (L
the Standard Model uses G=SU(3)×SU(2)L×U(1)Y as the local Yang-Mills symmetry 

group.  Many  other  theories  of  grand  unification  also  suppose  different  actions  of 

SU(2) group on left and right particles. In such cases the distance form  ˆ

It  implies  that  the  canonical  distance  form  should  be  modified  for  SU(2)L×U(1)Y 

particles.  To  remedy  the  situation  and  write  the  distance  form  for  particles  of 

representations 

 by simplest means one needs to introduce an additional field ϕα

The  distance  one-form  (27)  and  the  distance  (29)  generated  by  it  are  the  most 

important results of the paper. Mathematically, they are inevitable conclusions of the 

geodesics description in terms of particle representations and an assumption that the 

left and right components of the Lorentz group transform differently under the action 

of the local group of Yang-Mills symmetry. 

 

 

 

23 

The  field  ϕα

  obviously  scales  measured  distance.  The  idea  to  introduce  a  scaling 

factor into the length interval is not new and was proposed some years ago by Herman 

Weyl in a brilliant conjecture later transformed into the modern gauge theories. The 

original Weyl’s theory has been modified by different conformal theories of gravity 

where dilaton fields have been introduced in order to compensate the action of local 

conformal  symmetry  group  on  the  length  element.  In  our  case  the  Weyl’s  operator-
valued one-form  ˆΩ  associated with the scaling field ϕα

 is closed. The length element 

(29) will not change every time the system completes a closed path, which removes 
the  main  problem  of  the  original  Weyl’s  theory.  Since  the  scalar  doublet  ϕα
 

effectively plays the role of the Higgs field of Weinberg-Salam theory and provides a 

scaling for the measured distance, it can be referred to as Weyl-Higgs (WH) field. It 

should  be  noted  that  the  displacement  one-forms 
orthonormal in the presence of the WH field ϕα

aθ   are  orthogonal  but  are  not 

 (which is compensated by the Weyl’s 

form  ˆΩ   in  the  connection).  We  can  introduce  orthonormal  displacement  forms

model  we  obtain  the  action  and  motion  equations  for  a  classical  electron  in  fixed 

potentials of electro-weak interactions. 

We believe that the distance form (27) and the length element (29) are important for 

description  of  classical  phenomena.  They  support  Hume’s  space-time  philosophy 

demanding some physical property to be used for mapping space and time (Hume had 
“coloured”  points  of  space).  The  scaling  field  ϕα  can  be  used  to  discern  space-time 

points  and,  hence,  to  replace  Hume’s  colours.  The  distance  form  (27)  suggests  that 

24 

flat space-time (free of any matter) is an abstract mathematical notion since distance 

itself  requires  the  presence  of  the  WH  field.  Also,  any  form  of  WH  field  dynamics 

would  provide  a  reason  for  time  irreversibility  in  classical  physics.  Indeed,  motion 

reversing would require reversing the dynamics of the WH field in entire space-time, 

which  is  difficult  to  achieve.  The  distance  form  (27)  and  the  length  element  (29) 

might  be  useful  in  tackling  some  problems  of  classical  physics  such  as  particle 

existence  and  energy  divergences  of  classical  charged  particles  which  will  be 

discussed elsewhere. 

VII. Conclusion. 

We  study  geodesics  and  a  distance  in  classical  physics  enriched  with  additional  co-

ordinates  describing  particle  interactions.  We  show  that  metrical  relations  in  space-

time can be determined by the canonical distance form. The classical dynamics based 

on  the  modified  action  principle  describes  motion  of  particles  generated  by  Lorentz 

representations in fixed potentials of the linear connection and the Yang-Mills fields. 

Using concepts of the standard model of electroweak interactions we suggest that the 

distance form of our space-time should be scaled with a SU(2) Weyl-Higgs field. 

Appendix. Canonical distance form in a space of a Lie group. 

Eli  Cartan  has  shown  how  vectors  can  be  defined  on  the  manifold  of  a  Lie  group 
( G G×   principal  fibre  bundle)  [10].  The  canonical  form  that  corresponds  to  these 

vectors is the left-invariant canonical form of the Lie group

 and the torsion-free condition for this 

connection  follows  from  with  the  Cartan-Maurer  equations  (31).  All  these  facts  are 

well known [10]. 

We suggest that the canonical left-invariant form of the Lie group can be regarded as 

the  canonical  distance  form  in  accordance  with  the  discussion  above:  the  maximal 

eigenvalue  of  this  form  defines  bi-invariant  distance  consistent  with  the  Killing 

metric. Indeed, the canonical left-invariant form 

ˆ
ˆ

)

 defines an operator 

in  the  representation  space  for  any  representation.  The  maximal  eigenvalue  of  this 

operator is left and right invariant under the group action. The left invariance follows 

from the left invariance  of the canonical form. The right invariance comes from the 

fact  that  the  canonical  form  transforms  by  the  adjoint  transformation  under  right 

action of the group

 and sets of eigenvalues of adjoint operators

  are  normalised  eigenvectors  of  the 

operators A+B, A, and B respectively.) Thus, the eigenvalues of the canonical form of 

a Lie group define bi-invariant distances in the space of a Lie group provided they are 

not zero. 

 

 

 

The distance generated by the canonical form is equivalent to the distance generated 

by  the  Killing  form,  which  follows  from  the  uniqueness  of  the  bi-invariant  metric. 

Another way to see this fact is to notice that the operator space in addition to Killing 

form (which is essentially a Frobenius norm of operators of the adjoint representation) 

possesses a set of other equivalent norms. One example of the norm equivalent to the 

26 

Killing metric is the numerical radius of the operator: 

max
=
ξξ
1

ξ ξ
A

. For the normal 

matrices (which are 

t

A A AA=

t

, where superscript t means transposition) the spectral 

radius of the operator 

spr A
(

) max(

A
 is an eigenvalue of  )

 also defines a norm 

=

λ λ

equivalent  to  the  Killing  metric  and  to  the  numerical  norm.  It  means  that  the 

eigenvalues  of  the  canonical  form  for  many  interesting  groups  indeed  provide  bi-

invariant distance on the Lie group space equivalent to the traditional Killing metric. 

 

 

The  most  attractive  feature  of  this  construction  is  the  fact  that  the  canonical  form 

(which  serves  as  the  distance  form)  is  already  in  the  Lie  algebra  of  the  group  and 

hence exists in the principal fibre bundle. From (31) we see that the operator-valued 

connection form for the metric on the Lie group can be written as 

ω
ˆ

=

(1/ 2)

ˆ
θ

. This 

implies that the geodesic equations (7) for the manifold of the Lie group are

The solutions of (32) are one-parameter geodesic curves. This example suggests that 

the natural way to pack the canonical distance form into the Lie algebra is to allow the 

group action not only in the fibres of the corresponding fibre bundle but also on the 

base as well, which would require the supersymmetry for the Lorentz representations.

Abstract 
Rf plasma production in Whistler waves range of frequency ω/ωci >1 is applied on the compact helical 

system (CHS) in a steady state operation with low toroidal magnetic field strength, where ω/2π  and ωci 
/2π are rf and ion cyclotron frequencies, respectively.  Maximum rf power and pulse width are is170kW 
and 10 msec at 9MHz, respectively.  The line averaged plasma density <ne> as high as 2x1018 m-3 (He 
plasma) is produced in the region of toroidal magnetic field strength on magnetic axis B=100G~1.5kG 
and the electron temperature measured at plasma periphery is about 20eV.  The wave magnetic field 
strength measured at the plasma periphery showed the evidence of the toroidal eigen modes of the 
Whistler waves. The additional long pulse microwave heating of 2.45GHz (>200msec) is applied and it 
sustains the plasmas while the microwave itself can not ignite plasmas when B< 600G. 
 
Introduction 
The rf plasma production was conducted on CHS by using Nagoya Type III antenna 1-2). Efficient plasma 
production was obtained in the frequency range ω/ωci < 0.8 for B>5kG, where rf frequency ω/2π=7.5-
14MHz.  Especially when ω/ωci ~0.8 on magnetic axis, efficient electron heating is observed.  Ray tracing 
analysis of the Ion Bernstein wave excited at the antenna (ω/ωci  >1 at the antenna position) showed that 
the efficient electron heating occurs via Landau damping where the parallel wave number of the wave 
increases. For more higher magnetic field, slow wave contributes to produce plasmas. For the purpose of 
discharge cleaning, Alfven wave related studies and high beta related studies in helical systems, the 
plasma production in a low toroidal magnetic field in <kG range is preferable. Whistler wave discharge 
in MHz range of frequency have the notable feature of producing plasmas in such a low magnetic field 
where ω/ωci >1 and the low phase velocity of the wave is expected to heat electrons to sustain plasmas. 
 
Whistler wave plasma production 
CHS2-3) is a torsatron-type device having l=2/m=8 helical structure, and major and minor radius are 1m 
and 0.2m, respectively. Magnetic fields of CHS can be operated in steady state by SCR power supply 
when B<1.5kG. The rf frequency, maximum rf power and pulse width are 9MHz, 170kW and 10msec, 
respectively. Nagoya Type III antenna is used for the rf plasma production (Fig.1) and it is originally 
designed to flow the rf current along the magnetic field lines at plasma periphery for the excitation of Ion 
Bernstein waves. The antenna width is 15cm and the length along the magnetic field line is 65cm.   2mm 
microwave interferometer for averaged density <ne> and magnetic probe for wave field measurements are 
located 1800 away from the rf antenna in toroidal direction. Movable Langmuir probe is installed in the 
same toroidal section where the antenna locates. 
The Whistler wave propagation is examined by Ray tracing in the configuration where ω/2π=13MHz, 
B=1.4kG (ω/ωci  =6 on magnetic axis), electron temperature Te=100eV, electron density on axis is 
1x1018m-3 and initial refractive index along the toroidal magnetic field of the ray N// is 14.  Figure 2 show 
that the ray propagates toroidally and absorbed by electrons via Landau damping. In the discharge 
process(electron heating) by the wave for the experimental condition, elastic and inelastic collisional 
damping also expected to contribute. 
     Figure 3(a) shows the dependence of rf produced helium (He) plasma density <ne> on B for the rf 
input power Prf =150kW and helium pressure PHe=5x10-5 torr.  In the low B region below 1kG, <ne> 
increases almost linearly with Prf.  <ne> of helium plasma as high as 2x1018m-3 is produced and the 
electron temperature measured at plasma periphery is about 20eV by 150kW of the rf power. The plasma 

2+k⊥)1/2=ωωpe

2/ωce , where k//, k⊥, ω pe /2π   and ω ce /2π are parallel, perpendicular (to the magnetic 

density produced here is factor ~5 smaller than the one at ω/ωci ~0.8 (B>5kG, slow or Ion Bernstein 
waves) with the similar RF power. This may be attributable to the poor efficiency of the Whistler wave 
excitation for the Nagoya Type III antenna. Whistler wave dispersion relation is expressed as 
c2k//(k//
field) wave number, electron  plasma frequency and electron cyclotron frequency, respectively.  It is 
conjectured that when B<500G,  the wave number is mostly determined by the antenna, therefore <ne> is 
proportional to B. When B>500kG, <ne> tends to saturate, so the wave length become longer with B to 
have toroidal eigen modes. The dependence of <ne> on Prf for the helium plasma is shown in Figure 3(b). 
The plasma is ignited above 80kW and increases proportional to Prf under the conditions where B=800G 
and PHe=5x10-5 torr. 
     In order to study the wave propagation along the torus, wave magnetic field strength Bwave is measured 
at the plasma periphery. Time evolution of <ne> and Bwave are shown in Figure 4(a) and (b), respectively, 
here Prf =160kW and B=1kG. During the rf pulse, the plasma density changes in time and strong Bwave 
peaks are observed at corresponding density npeak.  It is found that npeak increases with B as shown in 
Figure 5(a).  Because of less damping of the wave expected from Landau damping and collisional 
damping with neutrals, the waves are expected to propagate around the torus as shown by the ray tracing 
calculation and form toroidal eigen modes. The toroidal eigen modes of the Whistler waves are calculated 
and shown in Figure 5(b), where the toroidal eigen mode number is N. The experimentally obtained npeak 
stays in the same range of the calculated toroidal eigen modes. 
 
Effects of microwave heating(ECH) on rf plasmas 
For  the  electron  heating  of  Whistler  wave  plasma,  the  microwave  power  of  2.45GHz  and  20kWx2  is 
used.  The  time  evolution  of  <ne>,  the  edge  density  ne(edge)  )  and  electron  temperature  Te(edge)  at 
outmost  magnetic  surface  measured  by  Langmuir  probe  are  shown  in  Figure  6,  here  B=  613G  and  Prf 
=105kW. The  plasma  with  peaked  density  profile  on  axis is  produced  initially  by the rf  power.   At  the 
last  4msec  of  the  rf  pulse,  the  microwave  power  of  18kW  is  applied  on  the  plasma.    Additional 
microwave  power  which  is  17%  of  rf  power  causes  the  increase  in  average  density  of  20%,  while 
ne(edge)  increases  three  times  as  much  as  the  rf  plasma.  After  the  rf  power  is  shut  off,  the  microwave 
power can sustain the plasma but ne(edge) jumps up and <ne> drops. This change in density implies that 
more flatter  plasma  profile  than  that  of  the  rf  plasma  is  produced  by  ECH  . This  is  due  to  the  fact  that 
there is no density limit for the Whistler wave propagation, so the wave can penetrate at the center of the 
plasma but it is difficult for ECH(O or X modes) to penetrate deep inside the high density region. It is 
also  shown  that  the  plasma  density  can  not  start  up  for  B<  600G  when  only  the  microwave  power  is 
applied.  However  by  this  rf  start-up  plasma  can be  sustained  by  ECH  even  when  B<600G.  Increase  in 
<ne> with the microwave power under the fixed rf power is observed also above the cut-off density for 
2.45GHz microwave. 
 
Conclusion 
Rf plasma production in Whistler waves range of frequency ω/ωci >1 is applied on CHS. The line 
averaged He plasma density of 2x1018 m-3 is produced for the toroidal magnetic field strength on magnetic 
axis B=100G~1.5kG. The evidence of the toroidal eigen modes of the Whistler waves is observed. The 
additional long pulse microwave heating of 2.45GHz (>200msec) is applied and it can sustains the 
plasmas while the microwave itself can not ignite plasmas especially when B< 600G

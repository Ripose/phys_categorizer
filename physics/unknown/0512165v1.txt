Abstract.  This  work  is  an  attempt  to  test  the  concept  of  hydrodynamic  charge  (analogous  to  the 
electric charge in Electromagnetism) in a simple case of a coherent structure such as the Lamb-
Oseen vortex. We provide experimental measurements of both the so-called Lamb vector and its 
divergence (the charge) by two-dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry. In addition, we perform 
a  Helmholtz-Hodge  decomposition  of  the  Lamb  vector  in  order  to  explore  its  topological 
features. We compare the charge with the well-known Q criterion in order to assess its interest in 
detecting  and  characterizing  coherent  structure.  Usefulness  of  this  concept  in  studies  of  vortex 
dynamics is demonstrated.

1.  Introduction 
 

One  of  the  crucial  issues  in  Turbulence  is  related  to  the  identification  of  the  so-called 
coherent  structures  in  complex  flows.  These  structures  are  characterized  by  a  spatial 
concentration in vorticity, a life time much longer than the period of rotation (or turn-over time) 
and  by  their  unpredictability.  Several  criteria  to  detect  coherent  structures  (different  from  the 
vorticity one) were introduced in the literature and no consensus was reached so far [1]. Recently 
the  notion  of  « Q  criterion »  (or  Weiss  determinant)  was  introduced  in  order  to  characterize 
turbulent  flows  mainly  in  numerical  simulations:  one  calculates  the  Laplacian  of  the  dynamic 
pressure  alone  to  visualize  the  coherent  structures  [2,  3].    On  the  other  hand,  a  vortex  is 
characterized  by  a  low  pressure  in  its  centre  and  its  core  exhibits  a  local  velocity  minimum. 
Indeed,  the  experiments  of  Douady  &  al.  [4]  on  the  visualization  of  coherent  structures  in  a 
turbulent flow by injecting air bubbles in water show that the bubbles do accumulate in the centre 
of the structures that is in the pressure minima, which correspond to the vorticity maxima. These 
authors have also pointed out the analogy between the Q criterion and the electric charge. 

The  goal  of  our  paper  is  to  validate  experimentally  a  criterion  based  on  the  so-called 
“hydrodynamic  charge”  with 
the  help  of  an  analogy  between  Fluid  Mechanics  and 
Electromagnetism dating back to Maxwell, to compare it with the Q-criterion, and to demonstrate 
the  usefulness  of  the  new  criterion  to  study  vortex  dynamics.  In  particular,  we  aim  at 
demonstrating  the  usefulness  of  this  concept  associated  to  the  mapping  of  the  so-called  “Lamb 
vector” in order to characterize the vortex core and structure. According to our knowledge, there 
are  almost  no  experimental  measurements  of  the  Lamb  vector  as  well  as  the  hydrodynamic 
charge. 
 

2.  The Lamb vector and the hydrodynamic charge 
 

a.  Theoretical Background 

The  Navier-Stokes  equation  for  incompressible  flow  ( ∇.u = 0)  can  be  written  under  a 

peculiar form known as the Lamb formulation [5] :

  The  Lamb  vector 

  is  the  vortex  vector  ( w = ∇ × u  is  the  vorticity)  which  is  analogous  to  the 

where 
angular velocity of solid rotation in solid mechanics. 
  represents  the  Coriolis  acceleration  of  a  velocity 
 
field under the effect of its own rotation (usually for solid body rotation, the Coriolis force is built 
with a rotation vector which is independent of the velocity). 
 
proposed a set of “hydrodynamic Maxwell equations” which takes the form [6, 7] :

where qH is the so-called “hydrodynamic charge density”. 
 
The  first  equation  stands  for  the  conservation  of  the  vorticity  flux  along  a  tube  of 
vorticity. It implies the absence of monopole source of vorticity as a vorticity tube that wraps on 
itself, goes to infinity or is connected to the walls of the flow volume. One finds the second and 
third  equations  by  taking  respectively  the  curl  and  divergence  operators  of  the  Navier-Stokes 
equation. The second one illustrates that the temporal variation of the angular velocity is equal to 
the  torque  exerted  by  the  Coriolis  force  that  is  the  Lamb  vector.  The  third  one  shows  that  the 
sources of the Lamb vector are the pressure and velocity gradients. 

The  hydrodynamic  charge  can  be  seen  as  a  topological  feature  of  flow.  Indeed,  it  is 
expressed mathematically as the curvature of the sum of potential (pressure) and kinetic energies. 
One notices that it vanishes when the flow is irrotationnal ( w= 0 implies  l = 0).  

There  exist  localized  topological  structures  associated  with  a  charge  that  correspond  to 

vorticity filaments, vortices, and, more generally, to the so-called coherent structures.  
 

One can resume the analogy due to H. Marmanis and S. Shridar [6, 7] with a table. Each 

electromagnetic property has an hydrodynamic counterpart :

One  can  separate  the  Lamb  vector  in  two  parts  according  to  the  so-called  Helmholtz-Hodge 
decomposition [8, 9] : 

l = l// + l⊥ = ∇α+ ∇ × β  with 
The  indexes  //   and ⊥   correspond  to  the  projections  of  the  Lamb  vector  parallel  (irrotationnal 
part) and perpendicular (solenoidal part) to the wave vector in the associated Fourier space. One 
 and the scalar α is 
infers that the hydrodynamic charge is a function only of the parallel part 
completely determined by the incompressibility constraint ( ∇.u = 0) :

solution  of  a  Laplace  equation  (see  the  numerical  implementation  below).  For  example,  the 
vector  potential  (velocity)  outside  a  solenoid  (a  Rankine  vortex)  derives  from  a  harmonic 
function.  Hence,  its  time  derivative  is  a  gradient  that  can  enter  into  the  longitudinal  part.  The 
boundary conditions are essential in order to guaranty uniqueness. 
In a particular case of a stationary flow and when the viscous effects are negligible, the 
 
Navier-Stokes  equations  resume  to  the  “auto-strophic”  equilibrium  (one  speaks  of  geo-strophic 
equilibrium when the Earth Coriolis effect equilibrates the pressure gradient) :

 and 

0≡∇αu.

The Lamb vector is perpendicular to the surface of constant α and each of these surfaces features 
the streamlines and the vorticity lines [10]: 
0≡∇αw.
 
Hence, the transverse component of the Lamb vector is equal to zero and this implies the 
existence  of  a  relation  between  the  stream  function  and  the  vorticity,  which  in  2D  is  equal  to 
minus the Laplacian of the stream function [5]. This property is very important in 2D Turbulence, 
which features an inverse energy cascade from the small to the large scales of the flow. Indeed, in 
3D turbulence, it is the transverse component of the Lamb vector, which is at the origin of the 
direct cascade of energy from the large to the small scales of the flow [11, 12]. It can be shown 
that  the  longitudinal  component  is  passive  :  its  evolution  is  controlled  by  the  transverse 
component [12]. In general, the transverse part is highly reduced in the region of space where the 
vorticity is concentrated [13]. 
 

b.  The Lamb-Oseen Vortex 

The  Lamb-Oseen  (Gaussian)  vortex  is  a  convenient  model  to  derive  the  hydrodynamic 
charge  of  a  typical  single  vortex.  For  comparison,  in  a  Rankine  vortex  the  Lamb  field  is 
discontinuous at the edge of the core and the charge diverges. We assume open cell, meaning that 
the characteristic radius of the Lamb-Oseen vortex core, r=a, is much smaller than the cell radius. 
If Ω denotes the angular speed parameter of the vortex, the fields are expressed as follows:

The  hydrodynamic  charge  is  negative  except  around  the  edge  of  the  core  at  r=a.  For 
comparison, the Rankine vortex has a rigid rotation core inside which 
 and at the edge 
of  the  core  there  is  an  opposite  delta  function  charge  distribution.  In  any  case,  one  expects  the 
total charge per unit height ( Δz = 1) to vanish:

In  the  rest  of  the  paper  we  study  experimentally  a  Lamb-Oseen  vortex.  From  Particles 
Images  Velocimetry  measurements  we  extract  the  Lamb  vector  field  and  compute  the 
hydrodynamic charge. Then, we implement a numerical Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of the 
Lamb vector field.

3.  Experimental Measurements 

 
The setup consists of a single stirring rod of 40mm diameter, 110mm in length, rotating at 
the bottom of a water cell. The cell is cylindrical with 290mm inside diameter and 350mm height, 
and closed from above by a transparent Perspex plate in complete contact with the water. The tip 
of the rod is trimmed as a four-blade stirrer extending to the diameter of the rod where the blades 
are  flat  3mm  thick  and  20mm  high  (see  Fig.  1).  The  measured  flow  was  produced  with  rod 
rotation speed of 7 rounds per second. 

 
The flow is measured by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) at the plane 45mm above the 
rotating tip using 2mm thick light sheet from a double pulse laser (SoloPIV 532nm from New-
Wave Research). The separation time between pulses is fixed at 1 ms. A double frame camera of 
1 Mega-pixels is located above the cell. The analysis program is based on multipass correlation 
algorithm,  written  by  Enrico  Segre.  The  resulting  instantaneous  velocity  field  is  determined  on 
80X80 vector grid. The velocity fields were acquired at a rate of 4 Hz during 38 seconds.

From the PIV measurements, one infers the velocity field and computes the radial profile 
of the azimuthal velocity field (Figs. 2 a-b). The fitted parameters according to the Lamb-Oseen 
. For all plots, the scaling is linear and the pictures are 
model are 
averaged over all acquired images. The vertical vorticity shown in Figures 2 c-d is deduced from 
the  velocity  field.  The  hydrodynamic  charge  is  shown  in  Figures  2  e-f.  The  negative  core  is 
surrounded  by  a  positive  annulus  of  charge  that  decays  farther  outside  to  zero  similarly  to  the 
Lamb  vector.  The  radial  profiles  of  the  vorticity  and  the  charge  compare  reasonably  with  the 
calculations of the Lamb-Oseen vortex with the same parameters as above.  
 
4.  Discrete Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition 
 

As mentioned above, we use the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition to separate the Lamb 
vector  into  an  irrotational  and  a  solenoidal  part.  The  decomposition  is  implemented  in  a  way 
similar to Tong & al. [14].

The  discrete  Helmholtz-Hodge  decomposition  of  the  Lamb  vector  l  tries  to  mimic  the 
.  Here  d  and  r  are  the 
smooth  decomposition  described  by 
h
r
irrotational and the solenoidal part respectively. The so-called harmonic part h is both irrotational 
and solenoidal. As in 2D the curl is not a vector we have to rewrite the decomposition for 2D as 
  where  ∇J   is  the  co-gradient  and  J  rotates  every  vector  by  ninety 
l
degrees  in  counter  clock-wise  order  (see  Polthier  &  Preuß  [15]).  One  easily  verifies  that  the 
  vanishes  and  thus  r  is  solenoidal  in  the  two  dimensional  case  too.  The 
divergence  of 
harmonic  part  can  be  added  to  d  or  r  without  changing  their  main  characteristic  (solenoidal  / 
irrotational). Thus the decomposition can be written as previously :

d
 correspond to projections of l onto the spaces of curl-
free  resp.  divergence-free  vector  fields.  Such  projections  can  be  achieved  by  minimizing  the 
following functionals:

Trying to mimic the smooth case, the two potentials D and R are derived by projections in the 
discrete case too; see Tong & al. [14] for details. Discretization of the above equations leads to a 
sparse linear system for each potential. To guarantee unique solutions boundary conditions have 
to be specified. We follow Tong and choose the boundaries of the potentials to be zero. With this 
choice d is orthogonal to the boundary and r is tangential to it.1 To solve the sparse systems, we 
employ  a  standard  conjugate  gradient  method.  The  solution  vectors  contain  the  values  of  the 
potentials  for  each  point.  Computing  the  gradient  and  the  co-gradient  respectively  yields  the 
desired components of the field l.  
Since  the  decomposition  is  a  global  variational  approach  and  as  the  potentials  are 
 
computed  by  integrated  values  the  decomposition  has  smoothing  effects  on  the  results.  This  is 
valuable as we are working with measured data. 
 

For all plots in Figure 3, the streamlines associated to each type of vector are started at 
randomly distributed points. The Lamb streamlines are emitted from the centre of the vortex. If 
the Lamb vector was only a gradient the streamlines should be star-like. However, one notices for 
our  experimental  vortex  a  small  spiralling  behaviour.  One  infers  the  presence  of,  at  least,  a 
transverse part of the Lamb vector, which indeed looks like a four-leaved clover, which reminds 
us the symmetry of the stirrer (Fig. 1). In addition, both the divergence-free and the harmonic part 
of the Lamb vector are asymmetric. 

5.  Criteria for detection of the vortex centre. 
 
 
In order to compare the criterion based on the Lamb vector and hydrodynamic charge (see 
Fig.2e-f)  with  one  of  the  considered  before  criteria,  namely  Q-criterion,  let  us  first  relate  these 
two  criteria.  Indeed,  the  hydrodynamic  charge  can  be  easily  computed  with  the  gradient  of  the 
kinetic energy and the Q-criterion via expressions:  

 

hence :

)

The vortex cores are usually characterized by strong positive values of Q (as the pressure 
reaches a minimum in the centre) and we can identify the vortex cores as the circular regions with 
positive  Q  around  a  peak  of  vorticity.  As  discussed  previously,  the  hydrodynamic  charge  takes 
into account both the influence of pressure (Q) and the influence of velocity. Indeed, the vortex 
centre  corresponds  to  a  local  minimum  of  these  two  quantities.  The  Q-criterion  captures  only 
minima of pressure. Hence, the hydrodynamic charge is a kind of modified Q-criterion that takes 
into account also influence of the kinetic energy.  
 
 
In    Fig.  4a,  we  superimposed  visualization  of  the  Lamb  vector  and  the  hydrodynamic 
charge fields. This image actually reproduces the same data and in the same form that shown in

decomposition. Figure 4b presents the following data: the color and color-bar visualize field of 
div(grad(u²/2)),  the  scaled  arrows  show  grad(u²/2),  the  line  integral  convolution  (LIC)  in  the 
background shows the structure of grad(u²/2), the dots with the white lines show the topology of 
grad(u²/2). The red squares are saddle points and the blue squares are sinks. Both are zeros of the 
vector field displayed. In Fig. 4c the Q-criterion is presented. One can learn from the images that 
the hydrodynamic charge and the Lamb vector fields characterize the vortex in the clearest way. 

6.  Vortex dynamics characterization 
 

 

 

An  immediate  and  useful  application  of  the  Lamb  vector  and  hydrodynamic  charge 
concepts  is  to  study  dynamics  of  coherent  structures  in  turbulent  flow.  As  an  example  we 
examined  first  movies  of  PIV  images  by  using  the  divergence-free  (solenoidal)  part  and 
rotational-free part of the Lamb vector field and found a clear episode pattern. Ordinarily in the 
rotational-free part we observe a cloud of vectors pointing towards the centre of the vortex (the 
direction does not change in either rotation direction of the vortex). Only occasionally we observe 
events that the vortex breaks into separate hydrodynamic charges. A cloud emerges with outward 
pointing  vectors  beside  the  inward  pointing  vectors  cloud,  but  in  the  next  frame  the  ordinary 
situation  is  recovered  (see  Fig.  5).  In  the  solenoidal  picture  of  such  events  we  observe 
disturbances with high magnitudes. 

 
In order to identify numerically the occurrence of special events we describe two results 
of  analysis  by  intuitive  names  as  the  "polarity"  and  the  "EMF"  (electro-motive  force).  The 
polarity  is  a  quantity  of  the  maximal  positive  charge  minus  the  maximal  negative  charge 
observed  in  the  frame  (the  charge  is  the  divergence  of  the  rotational-free  part  of  the  Lamb 
vector).  The  EMF  is  the  net  value  of  the  solenoidal  part,  presented  as  the  magnitude  of  the 
averaged vector over the entire frame. As we have shown for a single eddy, the Lamb vector in 
solenoidal part is related to the time derivative of the global vorticity (that is analogous to a time 
derivative of a magnetic flux that produces EMF). Accordingly in Fig. 6 we show the trajectory 
of  the  vortex  centre  in  x-y  coordinate,  which  determination  is  based  on  the  Lamb  vector  and 
hydrodynamic charge criterion, the polarity and the EMF (in arbitrary units) versus time. Clearly, 
there  are  specific  events  that  are  identified  by  peaks  in  both  the  polarity  and  EMF  plots.  For 
example, the episode shown in Fig. 5 relates to the first peak at t=0.75 sec. In addition, there is a 
correlation  between  the  peaks  and  abrupt  changes  in  the  course  of  the  vortex  trajectory,  as 
marked by arrows in Fig. 6. One can also notice that large EMF peaks predict large instability of 
the  trajectory  (indicated  by  larger  displacements).  This  analysis  demonstrates  usefulness  of  the 
approach to identify the vortex core and to provide detail information about dynamics of coherent 
structures that has been unavailable before. 
 
 
 
 
 
7.  Conclusions and Perspectives 

 

 

In this paper we demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the concepts of the Lamb 
vector  and  the  hydrodynamic  charge  to  locate  and  characterize  coherent  structures  such  as  a 
vortex on the experimental data. In addition, the topology of the Lamb vector seems also to be a 
rather  robust  indicator  for  the  presence  of  coherent  structures  particularly  by  applying  the 
Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition. 

However, the scope of our results is limited as one needs to confirm such indications for 
more  complicated  situations  such  as  described  in  the  numerical  simulations  of  Kollmann  and 
Umont  [16].  From  the  experimental  point  of  view,  three-dimensional  PIV  seems  to  be  a  good 
candidate in order to explore more deeply the role of the Lamb vector and its divergence in our 
understanding of coherent structures in turbulence.

Figure 1: (Experimental Vortex) A snapshot of the divergence-free part of the Lamb vector and 
the rotating rod tip that may explain the peculiar symmetry. 
 
Figure 2 (Colour Online) : (Experimental Vortex) a. velocity field and its LIC visualisation (LIC 
is the line integral convolution), b. radial profile of the azimuthal velocity, c. vertical vorticity (in 
s-1),    d.  radial  profile  of  the  vertical  vorticity,  e.  planar  Lamb  vector  and  planar  hydrodynamic 
charge  (in  s-2),  f.  radial  profile  of  the  hydrodynamic  charge.  The  profile  fits  are  based  on  the 
Lamb-Oseen model. 
 
Figure 3 : (Experimental Vortex) a. planar Lamb vector field and its streamlines, b. divergence-
free part of the Lamb vector, c. vorticity-free part of the Lamb vector and d. harmonic part of the 
Lamb vector. 
 
Figure  4 (Color  Online):  (Experimental  Vortex)  a.  hydrodynamic  charge,  b.  gradient  of  the 
kinetic energy, c. Q criterion = Laplacian of the pressure. 
 
Figure  5:  (Experimental  Vortex)  A  typical  episode  of  spontaneous  disturbances  in  the  vortex 
shape and course as observed in the irrotational part of the Lamb vector (time t=0.5s; 0.75s; 1s). 
 
Figure  6  (Color  Online):  (Experimental  Vortex)  Summary  of  correlated  quantities  in  vortex 
dynamics for spontaneous disturbances: the centre position of the vortex, the polarity, and EMF 
versus time (see definitions in text). Arrows indicate the point of the event on the 3D plot of the 
trajectory.

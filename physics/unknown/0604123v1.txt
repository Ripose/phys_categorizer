Abstract 

The  present  work  provides  a  new  conceptual  framework  for  GUT  (Grand 

Unified  Theory)  based  on  a  picture  of  fractal  universe.  Under  a  hypothesis  of 

multi-scaled matter structure, we find new clues for the conciliation of quantum and 

relativity and for the unification of fundamental interactions. A new interpretation for 

matter wave is proposed as the trajectory of position center of a moving particle with 

a  nucleated  structure.  The  origin  of  magnetism  and  gravitation  are  discussed  as  the 

relativistic effects of electrostatic force.   

Keywords: GUT; Quantum; Relativity; Matter Wave; Fundamental Interactions;   

 

 

Since 30’s of 20th century,  human beings’ exploring frontier of micro world has 

been boosted into the field of particle physics. At the beginning of 1960’s, thanks to 

the development of the building technologies of big accelerators, a large quantity of 

new  “elementary  particles”  has  been  found.  Till  then,  five  forces  came  into  human 

sight,  i.e.,  electrostatic,  magnetic,  gravitational,  strong  nuclear  and  weak  nuclear 

forces.  Among  them,  electrostatic  and  magnetic  forces  had  already  been  unified  by 

Faraday/Maxwell  as  electro-magnetic  force;1  the  electromagnetic  force  and  weak 

nuclear  force  were  unified  through  QED,  Feynman  rules,  symmetry,  group  theory, 

gauge  theory  &  renormalization  etc.  (by  Glashow,  Weinberg,  Salam,  et  al.)  as 

electro-weak  force;2  on  similar  lines  with  quantum-chromodynamics  (QCD),  the 

strong  force 

is  further  considered 

to  be  unified, 

leading 

to 

the  so-called 

Standard-Model.3-5   

Standard  Model  believes  that  there  exist  four  fundamental  interactions  in  the 

nature: strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravitation, and three kinds of elementary 

particles: gauge-bosons, fermions, and maybe Higgs. Grand Unified Theories (GUT) 

are  just  those  theories  aiming  at  unifying  the  different  particles  and  interactions  in 

different  existence 

scales,  and  String/Membrane 

theory  and 

its  variant 

Supergravity/quantum-gravity theory are representatives of GUT.5   

However, there are unsolved problems in these theories which prevent us to reach 

the  ultimate  goal  of  GUT.  For  example,  an  unsolved  problem  of  Standard-Model 

concerns the existence of Higgs particle which is needed for Spontaneous Symmetry 

Breaking  to  make  particles  massive,  but  till  now,  there  are  no  such  particles 

experimentally found. As for the string-based theories, they rely on high dimensional 

space to accomplish the unification  of fundamental interactions whilst there is not a 

consensus  of  the  number  of  dimension.  Another  distinct  shortcoming  of  the  above 

theories  lies  in  their  long  logical  path  to  the  end  of  unification  which  makes  them 

seem  to  be  too  complex  to  be  creditable.  The  present  work  provided  an  alternative 

logically simple pathway towards GUT based on a picture of fractal universe.   

Basic Principles and Matter Structure 

Relativity  of  Measurement  all  of  our  knowledge  about  quantity  are  from 

measurement.  Measurement  is  a  procedure  of  comparison  where  a  measure  unit  is 

taken as a standard to be compared with the object to be measured and the quantity of 

this object is determined according to the number that this object contains the measure 

unit. The property of measurement that a measure unit is always taken as a reference 

is  called  the  “relativity  of  measure”.  Here  measure  includes  the  measure  of  space, 

time, speed and energy. The relativity of measure means that big or small (of space), 

short or long (of time), fast or slow (of speed), high or low (of energy) are all relative. 

A human’s body is smaller than a mountain but bigger than an ant; a human’s lifespan 

is shorter than a tortoise but longer than a fly; a human runs slower than a leopard but 

faster  than  a  snail;  a  human  has  more  power  than  a  rabbit  but  cannot  pull  back  an 

elephant. All the above examples demonstrate that big or small, long or short, fast or 

slow and high or low (of energy) are all relative. The key is to see the measure of the 

object  as  standard  (reference),  or  namely,  the  relative  scales  of  the  two  objects  for 

comparison.   

From  the  “relativity  of  measure”,  it  can  be  deduced  that  the  matter  structure  is 

infinitely  divisible.  Proof  is  as  follows:  because  measure  is  relative,  there  is  no 

absolute bigness or smallness; if the matter structure is not infinitely divisible, there 

must exist absolute bigness or smallness, which contradicts the “relativity of measure”; 

so the matter structure is infinitely divisible. 

Basic Principles 

1.  Same law principle: all the existence scales keep to the same physical laws; 

2.  Statistics principle: macro state and micro state coexist. 

According  to  the  above  “relativity  of  measure”,  an  infinitely  divisible  matter 

structure  is  obtained.  While  what  is  the  relationship  between  matter  structures  at 

different  existence  scales?  And  what  is  the  relationship  between  the  laws  that  they 

keep to? Same law principle tells us that matter structures at different existence scales 

are similar to each other because they keep to the same physical laws. Then, we can 

know  that  if  we  take  human  beings’  existence  scale  as  the  center,  there  are  infinite 

numbers  of  “big  human”  worlds  upward  and  among  them  the  one  who  takes  solar 

system as an atom is the nearest world from ours along the direction of big scale, and 

from  now  on,  if  we  say  the  “big  human  world”  without  otherwise  statement,  it  is 

default as this world.  Likewise,  there  are infinite  numbers of “small human” worlds 

downward  and  among  them  the  one  who  takes  an  atom  as  the  solar  system  is  the 

nearest world from ours along the direction of small scale, and from now on, if we say 

the  “small  human  world”  without  otherwise  statement,  it  is  default  as  this  world. 

Therefore, the matter structure of our universe is an infinitely divisible fractal.   

According  to  the  self-similarity  of  a  fractal,  we  know  that  particles  at  any 

existence  scales  have  a  structure  like  solar  system  or  atom,  i.e.,  the  “nucleated- 

revolving” structure. At the same time of space scaling, the time is also scaling. That’s 

to say, the time unit used in the small human world is shorter than that of our world 

whilst the time unit used in the big human world is longer than that of our world. But 

the scale for space scaling and that for time scaling is not the same, therefore, the light 

speeds in different scale worlds are not the same. Suppose the light speed in our world 

is  c , then the light speed in the small human world is larger than  c   (may be 

2c   )   

called “fast light” and the light speed in the big human world is less than  c   (may be 

c ) called “slow light”.   

However, the human beings in big human world do not feel the so-called (by us) 

“slow  light”  in  their  world  is  slow  because  all  of  the  processes  in  their  world  are 

slowed; and thus the speed of “slow light” is still the fastest speed in their world. We 

say the speed of “slow light” slow just because we take the light speed in our world as 

a  reference.  Likewise,  the  human  beings  in  small  human  world  do  not  feel  the 

so-called (by us) “fast light” is fast because all the processes in their world are fasted. 

For an existence scale, the light speed of that scale is the fastest signal speed for that 

scale which makes the interactions local seen in that scale.   

Statistics  principle  indicates  that  there  are  two  scales  for  the  description  of 

physical  phenomena:  macroscopic  and  microscopic.  And  there  exists  a  scale 

transformation  able  to  transform  the  description  of  microstate  to  macrostate. 

Therefore, the present theory can also be called “Scale Relativity”. 

Unification of “Fundamental” Interactions 

Inverse-Square  Law  The  form  of  fundamental  interaction  is  determined  by  the 

dimension  of  the  space.  The  only  reasonable  form  of  interaction  in  3D  space  is 

inverse-square law. Proof is as follows: 

 

Figure  1.  Inverse-square  force  as  a  result  of  the  decrease  of  meson  flow  areal density.  The 

area of the spherical surface

, 

which is the origin of inverse-square force. 

As shown in Figure 1, suppose the interaction between  two  bodies  M and m are 

realized  by  exchanging  meson  flows;  a  body’s  ability  of  sending  and  receiving 

mesons proportions to its matter quantity; and the interaction strength accepted by a 

body proportions to the meson numbers that it receives. 

Then the meson flow sent by body M uniformly diffuses to different directions in 

the 3D space, and then the frontier of this flow is a sphere. Therefore, the area of the 

front  sphere  of  this  meson  flow  increases  with  the  increase  of  the  square  of 

propagation distance  r,  resulting  in the  areal  density of  the meson  flow  on the front 

sphere decreases with the square of propagation distance r. Then, the meson numbers 

received by  a unit quantity of matter decrease  in  proportion to the  square of r. And

Mm

This is just the form of inverse-square law where K is a constant to be measured by 

thus there is: 

experiment. 

An important view of Scale Relativity is that the form of fundamental interaction 

is determined by the dimension of the space. In the above deduction, three principles 

are  referred:  (1)  Locality  principle.  That  is,  the  interactions  are  local  ones  and 

realized  by  exchanging  mesons  with  finite  speeds.  There  is  no  instant  interaction 

acting  at  a  distance.  (2)  Simplicity  principle.  That  is,  the  strength  of  interaction 

linearly proportions to the matter quantity. (3) Symmetry principle. That is, different 

directions  of  our  space  are  symmetric  with  each  other  and  space  is  isotropic.  In  3D 

space, the formula who keeps to the above three principles is only inverse-square law 

(a). Similarly, the formula who keeps to the above three principles in 2D space is only 

the inverse-linear law while that for 4D space must be inverse-cubic law. And so on.   

Gravitation and Electrostatic Force They are all inverse-square interactions and 

essentially  the  same  interaction  but  appearing  at  different  scales,  and  thus  they  are 

relative. The so-called “gravitation” by us is the electrostatic force for big human; and 

the so-called electrostatic force by us is gravitation for small human. Therefore, it can 

be  predicted  that  there  must  exist  anti-gravitation  (repulsive  force).  Galaxies 

composed of matter and those composed of antimatter must be repulsive to each other 

so that our solar system is not attracted by other solar systems composed of antimatter 

and collides and annihilates. For big human, our solar system is just like an atom and 

sun  is  the  nucleus  and  the  planets  are  just  like  electrons.  When  the  planets  jump 

between  the  orbits  running  around  the  sun,  slow  light  is  emitted  which  is  the  light 

wave in the big human world and the speed of it is less than c (suppose c is the light 

speed of our world). Likewise, from the viewpoint of small human, our atom is just 

like the solar system of their world and the nucleus is the sun and the electrons are the 

planets. Communication between the nucleus and electrons are like the process of the 

sun throwing light to the earth. Therefore, the communication between nucleons and 

electrons is conducted by the “fast light”, i.e., the light in small human world.   

Strong  and  Weak  Forces  Essentially  speaking,  they  are  not  interactions  but 

reactions. Because strong and weak interactions only manifest in nuclear reaction or 

particle  decay  reaction,  thus  their  essence  are  reactions  just  like  chemical  reactions. 

Because  there  is  only  one  fundamental  interaction—  inverse-square  interaction  —in 

3D space which is a  long  range  interaction,  the short range  properties of strong and 

weak interactions prove  them to be reactions not interactions. Thinking that strong 

and weak interactions have equivalent positions to gravitation and electricity to be the 

fundamental  interactions  of  our  world  is  a  wrong  thinking.  Their  short  range 

properties  just  prove  that  they  are  not  interactions  but  reactions  just  like  chemical 

reactions.  Like  in  chemical  reactions  where  two  atoms  must  approach  to  each  other 

very  close  so  that  the  electron  orbits  of  the  two  reacting  atoms  are  superposed  with 

each  other  to  incur  chemical  combination,  two  nucleons  can  only  react  with  each 

when they are near enough so that the orbits of the nucleons’ electrons can superpose 

with  each  other  (see  Figure  2).  Just  as  we  do  not  regard  chemical  reaction  as 

fundamental  interaction  of  our  world,  we  should  not  regard  nuclear  reaction  and 

particle  decay  reaction  as  fundamental  interaction.  By  the  analogy  between  particle 

table  and  chemical  element  table,  we  are  convinced  that  the  essence  of  strong  and 

weak interactions is reaction not interaction. 

Figure 2. Schematic illustration of “nucleus in nucleus” structure of particles. 

 

In  a  summary  of  the  above,  we  know  that  there  is  only  one  fundamental 

interaction  in  3D  space  and  that  is  inverse-square  interaction  which  is  a  long  range 

interaction.  Any  short  range  “interaction”  is  essentially  reaction.  In  the  fundamental 

interaction, fermions are the agents and bosons are the media. Higgs particles do not 

exist. 

Conciliation of Relativity and Quantum 

As two cornerstones of the physics building of twenty century, Relativity Theory 

and  Quantum  Mechanics  have  achieved  glorious  triumph  in  their  own  applicable 

fields,  respectively.  But 

there  are  deep  contradictions  between 

them.  The 

contradictions  between  relativity  and  quantum  mainly  reflect  at  two  points:  (1) 

certainty  and  uncertainty.  Relativity  is  rigorously  a  theory  of  certainty.  Einstein 

persists  stubbornly  in  that  “God  doesn’t  play  dice”,  while  quantum  shows  some 

intrinsic  uncertainty  such  as  the  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  relation;  (2)  locality  and 

nonlocality.  Relativity  is  rigorously  a  local  theory  and  believes  that  there  is  the 

maximum signal  speed  while quantum  demonstrates some nonlocal correlation  such 

as in entanglement.   

These diametrically opposed contradictions disturb physicists deeply so that many 

people believe that one of them must be wrong. However, is this really so? Here we 

shall tell that the contradictions between relativity and quantum are phenomenological 

although  they  seem  profound,  and  relativity  and  quantum  can  be  unified  under  the 

framework of Scale Relativity. 

We shall begin with the uncertainty effect of quantum. Here we say uncertainty 

effect instead of uncertainty principle is aiming at emphasizing that the uncertainty is 

only a kind of effect rather than a principle. Just as space contraction and time dilation 

in special relativity are effects of motion relativity, uncertainty is some kind of effect 

of  scale  relativity.  We  cannot  determine  the  position  of  an  electron  but  we  can 

accurately measure the orbit of a planet. This fact tells us that whether or not we can 

obtain a precise measure depends on the relative scale of the observer and the object 

to  be  observed.  From  this  fact,  it  can  be  deduced  that  small  human  must  be  able  to 

accurately measure the position  of  an  electron because an  electron  looks as big as a 

planet in their eyes. Likewise, the orbit of our earth must be unable to be accurately 

measured by big human just like we cannot do it to an electron. Therefore, whether or 

not an object can be accurately measured is relative, thus, certainty and randomness 

(uncertainty) is relative. There is no absolute certainty and randomness just as there is 

no  absolute  motion  and  rest.  So  the  uncertainty  of  quantum  does  not  contradict  the 

certainty of relativity. 

Now see the locality and nonlocality. They are also relative.  As aforementioned, 

two  particles  (such  as  an  electron  and  a  proton)  that  rest  relative  to  each  other 

communicate  by  “fast  light”,  viz.  the  light  in  small  human  world.  Therefore,  the 

interaction between two particles with non-local correlation seen from our world may 

be local one seen from the small human world. We think the correlation is non-local 

because  the  meson  speed  that  connect  the  two  particles  surpasses  the  light  speed  of 

our world while small human think the correlation is local because the meson speed 

that  connect  them  does  not  surpasses  the  light  speed  of  their  world.  Likewise,  the 

local interactions seen from our world may be non-local ones seen by big human. Just 

because  the  maximum  signal  speed  at  different  existence  scales  are  different,  the 

non-local interactions seen from a scale may be local ones when seen from a smaller 

scale; likewise, the local interactions seen from a scale may be non-local ones when 

seen from  a  bigger scale. Therefore, to be local  or non-local is relative.  There is no 

absolute locality and nonlocality just  as there is  no absolute motion and  rest. So the 

nonlocality of quantum does not contradict the locality of relativity and is just some 

kind of effect of Scale Relativity. 

Now we see another manifestation of quantum: Discreteness. “Discreteness” and 

“Continuity” is a pair of relative concepts. That is, a discrete phenomenon seen from a 

scale may be continuous seen from another scale and vice versa. For example, asphalt 

road  surface  is  rugged  seen  by  ants  but  smooth  for  a  van  tire.  Discreteness  is  only 

observable at specific scale. For a bigger scale, it seems continuity due to the rough 

resolution  of  the  apparatus.  For  a  smaller  scale,  it  is  unobservable  due  to  too  large 

span of intervals (even longer than the human activity scope and history of that scale). 

Therefore, there is no absolute discreteness and continuity just as there is no absolute 

motion and rest. The difference between discreteness and continuity is only a kind of 

effect of Scale Relativity.   

About Superluminal Speed For every existence scale, there is a maximum signal 

speed which is the light speed of that scale. For a scale, the light speed of that scale 

cannot be surpassed whilst for a smaller scale, there is a faster light speed (the speed 

of “fast light” seen from the former scale). The smaller the scale is, the faster the light 

of  it  runs.  Therefore,  whether  a  light  speed  can  be  surpassed  or  not  is  relative.  For 

every  existence  scale,  it  cannot  surpass  the  light  speed  of  its  own  scale,  while  for  a 

smaller scale, the light speed of that scale is not a limit. The existence of maximum 

signal speed is also a kind of effect of Scale Relativity. 

About Minimum Quantum of Action It is believed that Planck constant stipulates 

the minimum quantum of action of our world. However, because of the relativity of 

measure,  for  a  bigger or smaller existence scale,  it is  not  the  minimum quantum  of 

action.  The  smaller  the  scale  is,  the  higher  the  energy  density.  Therefore,  the 

minimum quantum  of  action only  has a  relative  meaning; it is only meaningful  at  a 

specific  existence  scale;  its  existence  cannot  be  taken  as  a  reason  for  denying  the 

infinitely divisible nature of matter structure.   

The Essence of Matter Wave 

What is matter wave? And what is wave function. Making a clear comprehension 

for matter wave and wave function in quantum mechanics is another difficult problem 

disturbing  physicists  deeply.  Here  we  shall  give  the  answers.  The  essence  of  matter 

wave is the motion trajectory of the position center of a “nucleated-revolving” system 

in 3D space, i.e., a wave-like motion of position center; and meanwhile it is also the 

wave-like character of the systematic action of a “nucleated-revolving” system. While 

the wave function in quantum mechanics is an artificial (man-made) description of the 

systematic  action  of  the  “nucleated-revolving”  system  as  an  empirical  formula  and 

essentially  is  an  approximation  of  the  wave  character  of  the  systematic  action  in 

Hilbert space. The module square of wave function reflects the distance between some 

position 

in 

the  space 

(at  some 

time)  and 

the  position  center  of 

the 

“nucleated-revolving”  system  and  proportions  to  the  probability  to  find  the 

“nucleated-revolving” system at that position. Proofs are as follows: 

Figure  3.  The  trajectory  of  the  position  center  of  a  moving  “nucleated-revolving”  system  is 

 

wave. 

As illustrated in Figure 3, suppose there is a free “nucleated-revolving” system (a 

free particle) with a mass center velocity of 

cv . Here “free” means there is only the 

interaction  between  the  nucleus  and  the  peripheral  particle  (internal  force)  and  no 

external  forces  acting  on  the  “nucleated-revolving”  system.  Under  such  a  condition, 

the  system  should  rotate  around  their  common  mass  center  and  the  momentum  and 

energy and the angular momentum of this system all conserve in the moving. Suppose 

the distance between the nucleus and the mass center is dp and the distance between 

the  peripheral  particle  and  mass  center  is  de,  then  the  distance  between  the  nucleus 

and the peripheral particle is d = dp + de. Suppose the angular velocity of the system 

revolving  around  their  mass  center  is  ω,  the  linear  velocity  of  the  nucleus  running 

around  the  mass  center  is 

pv   and  the  linear  velocity  of  the  peripheral  particle 

running  around  the  mass  center  is 

ev ,  then  there  is 

ω=

direction  of  the  velocity  of  the  mass  center  as  the  positive  direction,  the  coordinate 

frame is established, and then the vertical coordinate  y   of the mass center is always 

zero. The position center of the “nucleated-revolving” system is defined as the middle 

point of the line between the nucleus and the peripheral particle. Suppose the distance 

between  the  position  center  and  the  mass  center  of  the  system  is 

cd ,  then

This  is  the  parameter  equation  of  the  trajectory  of  the  position  center  of  the 

“nucleated-revolving” system. 

From (4), we know that if the mass of the two parts of the “nucleated-revolving” 

system  (i.e.  the  nucleus  and  the  peripheral  particle)  equals,  then  the  position  center 

and  the  mass  center  of  the  system  are  superposed  with  each  other  and 

cd = ,  and 
0

thus there shows no wave character of this system; otherwise, if the mass of the two 

parts  of  the  “nucleated-revolving”  system  does  not  equal  to  each  other,  then  the 

position  center  and  the  mass  center  of  the  system  do  not  superpose  with  each  other 

and 

cd ≠ ,  and  thus  the  trajectory  of  the  position  center  is  a  wave.  Generally 

0

speaking, the mass of the “nucleated-revolving”  system is largely centralized on the 

nucleus.  So  the  position  center  does  not  superpose  with  the  mass  center  and  there 

shows the wave character of the system. 

Uncertainty  Relation  The  distance  d between 

the 

two  parts  of 

the 

“nucleated-revolving”  system  is  the  span  of  the  system  in  the  position  space  and 

represents  the  uncertainty  degree  of  the  position  of  the  system;  the  relative  speed 

v

dω=

  is the span of the system in the velocity space and represents the uncertainty 

degree of the velocity of the system. When the uncertainty degree of the  velocity is 

multiplied  by  the  mass  of  the  system,  it  represents  the  uncertainty  degree  of  the 

momentum  of  this  system.  According  to  the  definition  and  conservation  of  angular

From (5), we know that the uncertainty of position and the uncertainty of momentum 

have  a  relation  of  one  growing  and  the  other  declining.  That  is,  the  smaller  the 

uncertainty of position, the bigger the uncertainty of momentum; and vice versa. This 

is  just  the  meaning  of  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  relation.  Therefore,  the  uncertainty 

relation is a result of angular momentum conservation. 

Seen  from  another  viewpoint,  it  is  also  a  result  of  energy  conservation  of  the 

“nucleated-revolving” system. Because the inner force of the system is a conservative 

attractive force, the longer the distance between the two parts of the system (namely, 

the  bigger  the  uncertainty  of  position),  the  higher  the  percentage  of  the  system’s 

potential energy and the lower the percentage of the system’s kinetic energy (namely, 

the smaller the uncertainty of the momentum); on the contrary, the shorter the distance 

between  the  two  parts  of  the  system  (namely,  the  smaller  the  uncertainty  of  the 

position), the lower the percentage of the system’s potential energy and the higher the 

system’s  kinetic  energy  (namely,  the  bigger  uncertainty  of  the  momentum).  In  one 

word,  the  system’s  position  uncertainty  and  momentum  uncertainty  have  a 

relationship that one grows and the other declines. 

Readers who are familiar with the deduction procedure of the uncertainty relation 

from  the  wave  function  of  quantum  mechanics6  should  feel  the  conciseness  of  the 

deduction here. To obtain the uncertainty relation from the wave function of quantum 

mechanics needs a long and tedious deduction procedure, and the explanations for this 

relation are even more strange and elusive.7 Taking the orthodox explanation given by 

Heisenberg  himself  as  an  example,  he  thinks  that  uncertainty  comes  from  the 

disturbance from the instruments to the system to be measured. Later, his this idea has 

been  developed  to  the  function  of  human’s  consciousness,  sinking  into  subjective 

idealism.   

From  the  above  deduction,  we  know  that  the  uncertainty  relation  is  a  necessary 

result  of  the  conservation  of  the  angular  momentum  (or  energy)  of  a  free 

“nucleated-revolving”  system.  The  deduction  procedure  is  simple  and  the  physical 

meaning is clear.

it  can  be  found  that  the  wave  in  Schrödinger’s  equation  is  an  approximation  of  the 

wave  of  the  action  of  a  “nucleated-revolving”  system  in  Hilbert  space.  The  original 

intention of Schrödinger’s establishing wave equation is to study the atom structures 

with a new idea of wave motion. He made an analogy between free particle and plane 

wave and introduced artificially an imaginary exponential function to make the action 

of a free particle wave so that the stability of atom structure can be explained by the 

aid of a concept similar to standing wave. While the cost for this doing is dragging the 

wave in 3D real space into a mysterious complex space. As for the Planck constant in 

wave  function  (8),  it  is  an  indication  of  the  precision  of  our  apparatus  under  the 

present ability of measurement. Now we have known the essence and origin of matter 

wave,  we  do  not  need  Schrödinger’s  wave  equation  any  longer  in  principle. 

Nevertheless, as a set of empirical formulas, the formulism of quantum mechanics is 

still valuable in dealing with some practical problems. 

Distance  Function  Equation  (4)  is  the  parameter  equation  of  the  trajectory  of 

position  center  of  a  “nucleated-revolving”  system.  For  a  given  time  t,  it  gives  the 

average position of the “nucleated-revolving” system in the space. Therefore, we can

It  represents  the  distance  between  the  position  (x,  y)  and  the  position  center  of  the 

“nucleated-revolving”  system  and  reflects  the  probability  to  find  the  system  at 

position (x, y) and approximately proportions to the module square of Schrödinger’s 

wave function.   

The  position  center  of  a  “nucleated-revolving”  system  represents  the  position  of 

the  whole  of  this  system.  Equation  (4)  shows  that  there  is  a  certain  position  of  the 

position  center  of  the  system  at  time  t  and  the  probability  of  finding  this  system  at 

position  (x,  y)  negatively  proportions  to  the  distance  from  the  point  (x,  y)  to  the 

position center of the “nucleated-revolving” system. Because the nearness or farness 

of  the  distance  is  relative,  the  probability  to  find  the  position  center  of  the 

“nucleated-revolving”  system  at  some  position  does  not  change  when  the  distance 

function multiplied by a constant (it is equivalent to changing the measure unit of the 

distance). So the wave function can be normalized. 

By  now,  we  know  that  the  relativity  of  farness  or  nearness  of  distance  is  the 

foundation that the wave function of quantum mechanics can be normalized and we 

also  know  that  the  distance  function  is  the  essence  of  the  target  of  Born’s 

interpretation for wave function. In addition, we need notice that the position center is 

just 

the  position  center; 

it  only  gives 

the  position  of 

the  whole  of 

the 

“nucleated-revolving” system in an average (statistical) sense. In fact, there is neither 

the  nucleus  nor  the  peripheral  particle  at  the  position  center  of  the  “nucleated- 

revolving”  system.  Therefore,  by  detecting  the  motion  of  the  whole  system  via  the 

position  center  (just  as  what  we  do  at  our  existence  scale  to  conduct  microscopic 

experiments), we can only attain a statistical result in the end. 

  Take  hydrogen  atom  as  an  example.  We  can  detect  the  wave  character  of  a 

hydrogen atom in experiment just because we probe the motion of the position center 

as the proxy of the  whole hydrogen atom. For small humans, they  do not probe the 

position  center  of  a  hydrogen  atom  to  describe  its  motion  because  in  their  eyes,  a 

hydrogen atom is as big as a solar system and they can directly determine the position 

of proton and electron just as we directly probe the position of sun and earth. So what 

they get is not a statistical result. In a word, that’s to say, whether or not obtaining a 

statistical result is relative. We get the statistical result is some kind of effect of Scale 

Relativity. 

De  Broglie  Relation,  Schrödinger  Equation  and  Born  Interpretation  The 

concept of matter wave was given by de Broglie in 1924.8 He was enlightened by the 

wave-particle duality of photon and guessed that matter particles may also have wave 

character. His idea was verified by Davisson and Germer in an experiment of electron 

diffraction in 1927.9 The introduction of the concept of matter wave by de Broglie is a 

much-told tale by physicists as a successful example of using analogy. By analogy, de 

Broglie established the famous relation: 

pλ⋅ = (cid:61) .                                                                              (10) 

Comparing (10) with (5), we will find that de Broglie relation is another expression of 

uncertainty relation actually. In other words, they are the same thing in essence. They 

are  all  results  of  the  conservation  of  angular  momentum  and  energy  of  the 

“nucleated-revolving” system. 

Schrödinger equation was established by Schrödinger in 1926.10 It is also a result 

of analogy. Schrödinger analogized the moving free particle with the propagation of 

plane  wave  and  established  the  wave  equation  named  by  his  name.  The  concept  of 

wave function originates from his work. While seen in the direct meaning, the wave in 

Schrödinger’s equation and the wave in de Broglie’s relation are not the same “wave”. 

For example, the wave length in de Broglie relation has a dimension of length and a 

direct physical meaning. While the wave length for the wave in Schrödinger equation 

has no direct meaning because it is a wave in complex space. Therefore, the wave in 

de Broglie relation and the wave in Schrödinger equation are not the same wave seen 

from  a  direct  meaning.  The  essence  of  the  wave  in  Schrödinger  equation  is  an 

artificial  empirical  formula  reflecting  the  wave  character  of  the  action  of  a 

“nucleated-revolving” system. 

Born’s  interpretation  for  wave  function11  is  called  the  “Copenhagen”  orthodox 

interpretation.  However,  the  wave  in  Born’s  interpretation  is  a  wave  of  probability 

(amplitude), and seen from its direct meaning, it is neither the same to the wave in de 

Broglie relation (whose  wave length has a dimension of length) nor the same to the 

wave  in  Schrödinger  equation  (which  is  the  wave  of  action  in  complex  space).  The 

probability in Born’s interpretation essentially reflects the distance from some point of 

the space to the position center of the “nucleated-revolving” system. Just because of 

Born’s interpretation, the normalization of wave function comes into practice. In fact, 

no matter for the wave in Schrödinger equation or for the wave in de Broglie relation, 

there  is  no  need  of  normalization.  Because  de  Broglie  established  his  relation  by 

analogy  with  the  light  wave,  just  as  there  is  no  need  of  normalization  for  the  light 

wave,  de  Broglie’s  matter  wave  also  does  not  need  normalization.  Similarly, 

Schrödinger  established  his  equation  by  analogy  with  ordinary  plane  wave  (such  as 

mechanical wave or electro-magnetic wave), therefore, Schrödinger’s wave does not 

need normalization too just as ordinary plane wave does. However, Born proposes the 

probability  interpretation  for  wave  function  in  a  situation  that  people  have  no  idea 

about  the  origin  of  the  matter  wave  (i.e.,  no  realization  of  the  ubiquity  of  the 

“nucleated-revolving”  structure  of  micro  particles)  but  want  to  give  a  unified 

comprehension of wave-particle duality, thus eliciting the problem of normalization of 

the wave function. 

Summarizing the above, we know that seen from the direct meaning, the wave in 

de  Broglie  relation  and  the  wave  in  Schrödinger  equation  and  the  wave  in  Born’s 

interpretation have different meaning, respectively. However, they are also reflections 

from different aspects for the same underlying wave: the wave-like trajectory of the 

position center of the “nucleated-revolving” structure of micro particles.  De  Broglie 

relation  reflects  the  conservation  of  the  angular-momentum  (or  energy)  of  the 

“nucleated-revolving” system; Schrödinger equation reflects the wave character of the 

action of the “nucleated-revolving” system; while the Born interpretation reflects the 

distance 

from  some  point  of 

the  space 

to 

the  position  center  of 

the 

“nucleated-revolving” system. 

Wave-Particle Duality From the above deduction, we know that the motion of a 

“nucleated-revolving” system spontaneously demonstrates the wave character (of the 

position center) as a whole (the essence of wave is just the propagation of periodicity). 

On the other hand, the object who can spontaneously demonstrates the wave character 

must  be  a  “nucleated-revolving”  system.  Electrons  show  some  stationary-wave-like 

character  on  the  orbits  around  the  nucleus  of  an  atom;  therefore  they  must  have 

“nucleated-revolving”  structures.  Generally  speaking,  any  micro  particles  (except 

bosons, see explanation later) are “nucleated-revolving” systems. 

Now make a comparison with solar system. Earth is running around the sun and 

the moon is running around the earth. The mass ratio between earth and moon is 80:1, 

and then the position center of earth-moon system and the mass center of this system 

do not superpose with each other, and then the trajectory of the position center of the 

earth-moon  system  must  be  a  standing  wave  surrounding  at  the  orbit  of  the  mass 

center of this system (Figure 4).  In  addition, our solar system is composed of about 

ten  planets,  from  which  it  can  be  speculated  that  the  sun  may  be  also  not  a  unitary 

solid ball and that it may be a composite ball made up of about teen ~ twenty small 

balls as parts of it seeming like an atom nucleus. If really so, some characters of the 

composite ball may demonstrate in the activities of the sun, for example, the sunspots 

may  be  the  seams  between  these  part  balls,  and  the  precession  of  perihelion  of  the 

planets  may  originates  from  the  non-uniformity  of  the  gravitation  due  to  the  non- 

uniformity of the density of sun as a composite ball.   

 

Figure 4. Illustration for the trajectory of the position center of earth-moon system. 

The  essence  of  matter  wave  is  the  wave-like  motion  of  the  position  center  of  a 

“nucleated-revolving”  system  which  embodies  the  wave-particle  duality  very  well: 

On  one  hand,  position  center  demonstrates  spontaneously  the  wave  character  in  the 

moving;  on  the  other  hand,  at  a  specific  time,  the  position  center  has  a  specific 

position  so  that  it  also  demonstrates  the  particle  character  as  a  whole.  However,  as 

aforementioned, position center is just position center; it only represents the position 

of  the  whole  system  in  an  average  (statistical)  sense.  Therefore,  the  whole  particle 

only  has  certain  position  in  a  statistical  meaning  and  the  results  of  our  experiments 

remains statistical. 

After knowing the essence of matter wave, we can then evaluate different sorts of 

interpretations  for  wave  function.  The  following 

is 

the  evaluation  of 

two 

representative  standpoints.  One  is  Schrödinger’s  wave  package  interpretation  which 

emphasizes  the  wave  character  too  much  to  face  the  problem  of  diffusion  of  wave 

package. In fact, from the wave-like motion of the position center, we know that the 

“nucleated-revolving”  system  does  not  diffuse  because  the  attractive  inner  force 

between the two parts (nucleus and the peripheral particle). The other interpretation is 

the  ensemble  interpretation  from  Einstein  which  thinks  that  the  wave  character  is  a 

collective  property  of  a  large  quantity  of  particles  which  originates  from  their 

aggregation. This interpretation emphasizes the particle character too much. In fact, as 

what  we  know  now,  the  essence  of  matter  wave  is  a  kind  of  composite motion  (the 

compound  of  revolution  and  translation),  and  an  intrinsic  property  of  “nucleated- 

revolving” system which can be demonstrated by a single particle and does not rely 

on  the  aggregation  of  many  particles.  Therefore,  the  above  two  interpretations  for 

wave function are all biased in meaning and lose the key point of the truth. 

Just as what is said above, because of the relativity of measure, whether the wave 

character is significant or not is also relative. For small human, electrons seem as big 

as planets, and thus they do not care the wave character of electrons. Likewise, for big 

human, our earth is as small as an electron, and our solar system is not more than an 

atom. Therefore, if big humans make a big grating and take a beam of solar systems to 

throw on it, they will also detect the diffraction phenomenon of solar systems. Hereby, 

we know that the wave character and particle character are relative, and they are only 

some kind of effect of Scale Relativity. 

Scale  Transformation,  Symmetry  Breaking,  Randomness  and  the  Time  Arrow 

With  the  above  discussion  about  matter  wave,  we  can  now  discuss  “Scale 

Transformation”  in  more  details.  “Scale  transformation”  is  actually  a  simple 

averaging 

(summarizing)  procedure.  Because  summarizing  operation 

is  a 

many-to-one  map,  it  is  an  irreversible  procedure  which  is  the  origin  of  symmetry 

breaking and randomness. The reason is simple: we know 1 + 1 = 2, but if it is asked 

that 2 equals what? The answer is not necessarily  to be 1 + 1, because 1.5 + 0.5 or 

0.8+1.2 also equals to 2. That is to say, if knowing the two addends, we can uniquely 

determine the sum while if knowing the sum, we cannot uniquely determine the two 

addends.  The  essence  of  matter  wave  may  serve  as  an  excellent  example  to  explain 

that the randomness just originates from “Scale Transformation”. 

According to “Statistical principle” (special coexistence principle), we know that 

there are two scales for the description of the state of matter motion: microscopic and 

macroscopic.  At  microscopic  scale,  we  can  directly  describe  the  motion  of  the  two 

parts  of  the  “nucleated-revolving”  system  and  need  not  describe  the  whole  of  the 

system in a manner of position center approximation, therefore uncertainty  does not 

appear. While if because of the limitation of scale, we have to describe the whole of 

the “nucleated-revolving” system in a manner of position center approximation, then 

we  have  to  perform  a  statistical  averaging  to  get  the  position  center  of  the  whole 

system  (usually,  this  is  automatically  done  by  our  apparatus  which  is  used  for 

measurement  and  so  we  need  not  do  it  explicitly)  which  is  an  irreversible  single 

direction  physical  procedure  because  knowing  the  positions  of  the  two  parts  of  the 

“nucleated-revolving”  system  we  can  uniquely  determine  its  position  center  while 

knowing  the  position  center  of  the  system,  we  cannot  uniquely  determine  the 

positions of the two parts, which is the origin of randomness. 

The concept of Time Arrow is extensively discussed in recently years such as by 

Stephen Hawking in his “A Brief History of Time”3 or by Ilya Prigogine in his “The 

End  of  Certainty”12.  The  time  arrow  is  just  a  simple  fact:  every  one  of  us  (except 

some  patients  suffering  mind  diseases)  can  feel  the  single  direction  of  time  as  it  is 

always  going  from  yesterday  to  today  to  tomorrow.  But  why  the  time  is  single 

directional? This problem is not a simple one. To know the answer of this question, 

we  have  to  refer  to  the  reversibility  of  physical  process.  Yet  the  reversibility  of  a 

physical  process  relies  on  the  determinacy  of  the  physical  law  that  dominates  the 

process.  If  the  physical  law  is  of  certainty,  just  like  Newton  laws,  then  the  physical 

process is reversible in principle. Owing to the great success of Newton’s mechanics, 

there prevailed a kind of mechanical world view in eighteen century which believes 

that the universe is some kind of huge clock. It was said that Laplace had thought that 

if the position and momentum of each particle are given at a specific time, he can (at 

least  in  principle)  work  out  the  past  and  the  future  of  the  universe  and  then  time  is 

meaningless  in  his  eyes.  Later,  due  to  the  appearance  and  the  developments  of 

thermodynamics, it seems to have found the explanation for the time arrow: that is the 

second  law  of  thermodynamics,  i.e.  the  principle  of  entropy  increase  (in  an  isolated 

system). If we take the universe as an isolated system (it sounds reasonable because 

the universe is defined as the totality of our world; then according to this definition, 

there  is  nothing  outside  the  universe  and  if  there  is,  it  should  be  included  in  the 

definition), then the single direction of entropy increase may be the underlying reason 

of the single direction of time. However, this is only a simple correspondence (map); 

it gives neither the mechanism of time arrow nor the reason why entropy increases. 

Here,  we  shall  tell  that  the  increase  of  entropy  and  the  arrow  of  time  just  come 

from “Scale Transformation”. It is generally acknowledged that entropy is a measure 

of the microstate number of a system and the application of entropy increase principle 

relies on the adequate randomness of the system, i.e., ergodicity must be satisfied. As 

aforementioned, randomness just originates from the “Scale Transformation” and this 

is  the  precondition  of  the  application  of  entropy  increase  principle  and  the  entropy 

increase principle is only useful for a description of microstates at a macroscopic level. 

If we can directly measure and control the system at microscopic level (as if we have 

the ability of Maxwell’s demon), then entropy is a useless concept for us (Note: if we 

do not care a more microscopic existence scale) and every process is reversible for us 

and thus there is no single directional time in our eyes. 

Summarizing  the  above,  we  know  that  there  is  no  absolute  reversibility  or 

irreversibility  for  a  physical  process  and  that  there  is  no  absolute  certainty  or 

randomness  of  physical  phenomenon.  Whether  a  physical  process  reversible  or  not 

and whether a physical phenomenon certain or random rely on the measure scale. We 

detect the motion of an electron to be random but for small human, the motion of an 

electron is completely certain no matter for position or momentum. So whether or not 

time is reversible are relative and the time arrow is a kind of effect of Scale Relativity. 

The Essence of Field

What is Field? Field is meson flow. And the force lines are intuitive description of 

What  is Magnetic Field? Magnetic field is a kind of measure effect of “Motion

After charging, the electrons in the two conductors begin directional movements

The electrons in A2 have a directional speed  v   relative to the protons in A1, and 

then  because  of  the  conservation  of  the  quantity  of  electricity  (i.e.,  the  quantity  of 

electricity is an invariant of “motion relativity”)  and the contraction effect of length 

(of  the  “motion  relativity”),  the  areal  number  density  of  meson  flow  emitted  from   

the protons in A1 and received by the electrons in conductor A2 seems increased and 

as a consequence 

pF   increased. The following is a concise deduction procedure.

phenomenon of a net attraction between the two conductors which looks like there is 

magnetic field between the two conductors. 

Secondly, we see the situation where the two currents in the two conductors are in 

the  opposite  direction.  In  this  case,  the  protons  in  the  two  conductors  are  resting

Then we shall detect a net repulsion between the two conductors which are explained 

as the magnetic field between the two conductors.   

From  the  above,  we  know  that  the  magnetic  field  is  a  kind  of  effect  of  “motion 

relativity”  (special  relativity)  of  electric  field,  namely,  the  motion  of  electricity 

generates the magnetism. There is never magnetism without electricity. So, magnetic 

charge and magnetic monopole do not exist. 

What is Gravitation? Gravitation is the most common force around us. According 

to Einstein’s General Relativity, it can be regarded as the curvature of space-time13, 14. 

In  2005,  Prof.  R.  C.  Gupta  (I.E.T.,  Lucknow,  India)  proposed  an  alternative 

explanation that gravity can be regarded as the second-order relativistic manifestation 

of electrostatic force15. The following figure and table are recreated according to Prof. 

Gupta’s ideas.   

Figure 6. Schematic illustrations for the generation of gravitational field. Suppose two bodies 
(body I and body II) contain Helium-like atoms; the distance d between the two bodies is far 
larger  than  the  radius  of  the  atoms  R.  For  simplicity,  suppose  two  atoms  (each  one  in  each 
body) are arranged as shown where A1 & B1 are electrons in Body I and A2 & B2 are electrons 
in  body  II;  the  two  protons  in  body  I  are  grouped  as  P1  and  the  two  protons  in  body  II  are 

 

grouped as P2. The net Attraction (+) and Repulsion (-) factors between electrons and protons 
of the two atoms in the two bodies due to length contraction are listed in the following Table.

As shown in Figure 6 and Table 1, the net attraction will appear when the Lorentz 

velocity  addition  law  is  used  in  the  length  contraction  formula  and  Newton’s 

gravitational  formula  can  be  derived  from  Coulomb’s  electrostatic  force  formula  to

The  detailed  procedure  for  the  deduction  and  estimation  of  these  formulas  are 

presented in Gupta’s paper15.   

According  to  Prof.  Gupta,  the  “Van  der  Waals”  force  between  two  mesoscopic 

bodies such as two molecules, which are due to charge distribution, can be regarded 

as  the  “zeroth-order”  relativistic  effect  of  electrostatic  force,  meaning  with  “no” 

relativistic  effect  at  all;  the  magnetism  can  be  regarded  as  “first-order”  relativistic 

manifestation  of  electrostatic  force  because  it  considers  the  length  contraction  of 

special  relativity;  and  the  interactions  between  two  macroscopic  bodies  can  be 

regarded  as  the  “second-order”  relativistic  manifestation  of  electrostatic  force  of 

special  relativity  because  it  considers  the  relativistic  velocity  addition  (Lorentz 

velocity addition law). This view can conceptually unify the (long range) interactions 

as electrostatic force and its relativistic effects. But there are residual problem of this 

view because the gravitation between two neutrons cannot be explained in the way of 

two  atoms  unless  that  neutrons  can  also  be  regarded  as  a  nucleated  structure  like 

atoms.  According  to  Scale  Relativity,  we  know  that  all  the  (real)  particles  have  a 

“nucleated-revolving” structure. Then the forces can be unified as the inverse-square 

interaction  and  its  relativistic  effects,  which  fulfills  the  unification  of  long  range 

interactions.     

Does the mass really increase? The mass of a body will increase with the increase 

of the body’s speed is an important inference of special relativity (motion relativity). 

But  is  this  the  truth?  Up  to  now,  our  evidence  about  the  increase  of  mass  mainly 

comes from the acceleration experiments where it is found that it becomes more and 

more  difficult  to  accelerate  particles  and  when  it  is  calculated  using  the  formula  of 

charge-mass  ratio  and  seems  as  if  the  mass  has  increased.  However,  what  about  the 

truth? This should be started from the mechanism of acceleration. When a particle is 

accelerated  in  the  external  field,  the  increase  of  its  momentum  comes  from  the 

impulsive force of meson flow. Figuratively, it seems like a cobble is pushed rolling 

by the flow of a brook. The rolling speed of the cobble cannot surpass the speed of the 

stream.  And  when  the  speed  of  the  cobble  becomes  faster  and  faster,  the  difference 

between  the  speeds  of  the  cobble  and  the  stream  becomes  smaller  and  smaller,  and 

then the impulsive force the cobble received becomes less and less, and as a result, it 

seems that the cobble becomes more and more difficult to be accelerated. If we take 

the  impulsive  force  as  an  invariant,  we  will  think  that  the  mass  of  the  cobble  is 

increased.  While  in  fact,  the  mass  of  the  cobble  does  not  change,  and  just  the 

impulsive  force  becomes  less  and  less.  Similar  situation  appears  for  particles  to  be 

accelerated. Therefore, we know that mass just like electricity is also an invariant of 

“motion relativity”. Previously, thinking the increase of the mass with the speed is a 

misunderstanding. 

Electricity  and  Mass  Essentially,  mass  and  electricity  are  the  same  physical 

quantity: inverse-square quantity. They are the same physical quantity manifested at 

different existence scales. If the matter is not infinitely divisible, then if electricity is 

discrete, mass is discrete. In fact, as aforementioned, the matter is infinitely divisible, 

so discreteness and continuity is relative, just a kind of effect of Scale Relativity. The 

discreteness  of  charge  originates  from  our  observation  scale  and  the  inadequate 

resolution  of  our  apparatus.  In  fact,  fractional  charge  has  been  suggested  in  QCD. 

This has already challenged the traditional view of integral discreteness of electricity. 

It can be reasonably expected that the relativity of discreteness and continuity will be 

recognized with the development of the resolution of our apparatus. 

  What is Spin? Spin is the self-rotation of a particle and at the same time, is the 

revolution  of  the  peripheral  particle  on  its  orbit  around  the  nucleus.  Therefore,  the 

angular momentum of spin and the angular momentum of orbit of peripheral particle 

are relative and up to our observation scale. What is spin (the angular momentum of 

self-rotation)  seen  from  the  macroscopic  scale  where  the  nucleated  structure  of  the 

particle  is  out  of  sight  may  be  the  angular  momentum  of  orbit  of  the  peripheral 

particle  when  seen  from  microscopic  scale  where  the  nucleated  structure  of  the 

particle  is  in  sight;  and  vice  versa.  This  is  why  they  keep  to  the  same  commutation 

relation.  Spin,  as  a  kind  of  angular  momentum,  reflects  the  polarity  of  a  particle  or 

more accurately speaking, the directional property of a particle. Why we always get 

two  values  of  spin  (a  positive  one  and  a  negative  one)  when  we  detect  the  spin  of 

fermions?  The  reason  is  as  follows.  Although,  as  angular  momentum,  the  spin  of  a 

particle  can  have  many  directions,  but  when  coupling  with  each  other  as  magnetic 

moment,  there  are  only  two  arrangement  states  of  equilibrium:  up-magnetic 

(paramagnetic) and down-magnetic (diamagnetic). The former is a stable equilibrium 

and has lower energy; and the latter is an unstable equilibrium and has higher energy. 

That is why we can only detect two values of spin. 

What  is  isospin?  It  is  a  wrong  concept  introduced  in  a  wrong  way.  It  has  its 

historical meaning in a phenomenological theory staying in an empirical stage, but it 

cannot be taken as a concept with the meaning of truth. Once we have recognized the 

true structure of matter, we should abandon it in time.   

Super-Symmetry Super-symmetry is a great concept. It is proposed originally for 

the unification of the so-called fundamental interactions. It aims to construct a bigger 

group  to  accommodate  both  bosons  and  fermions,  i.e.,  letting  them  be  the 

representation  of  this  group.  Regarding  particles  as  representations  of  groups  is  a 

beautiful idea and a model of symmetry guiding physical research. But symmetry is a 

sward with two sharp edges: It can guide physical research in the right way and also 

can  misguide  it.  Which  result  appears  depends  on  whether  it  is  used  correctly.  If 

someone  wants  to  find  a  group  to  accommodate  all  the  chemical  molecules,  i.e., 

rendering  them  to  be  the  representations  of  this  group,  his  doing  is  reasonable  or 

unreasonable  just  as  we  render  the  so-called  elementary  particles  to  be  the 

representations  of  some  group.  Anyhow,  the  doing  of  correlating  the  group 

representation  with  the  law  of  fundamental  interaction  is  unreasonable.  The  law  of 

fundamental interaction is determined by the dimension of space and has nothing to 

do with group representation.   

String and Roton Representing particles as the different vibration model of strings 

is a beautiful idea in string theories16 and can be appreciated as a piece of artwork but 

cannot  be  regarded  as  the  truth  because  there  is  no  solid  foundation  of  this  idea.  In 

contrast,  “nucleated-revolving”  system  (called  “Roton”  for  short)  is  a  model  with 

solid foundation that at least the structures of atom and solar system are all this kind 

of structures. The idea that all the real particles (namely fermions) are Rotons satisfies 

the invariance of scale transformation and can unify interactions. Logically speaking, 

there are no more than two forms of interaction: “direct contact” or “via media”.  In 

3D  space,  the  sole  reasonable  interaction  in  the  form  of  “via  media”  (long  range 

interaction) is the inverse-square interaction whose formula has been proved above to 

be determined by the dimension of the space, and Rotons are the nucleated revolving 

structures naturally formed under such an interaction. While all the interactions in the 

form  of  “direct  contact”  can  be  regarded  as  the  combination  and  decomposition  of 

Rotons.   

Roton and Mass Point Roton, as a concept, represents the ubiquitous “nucleated- 

revolving” structure of particles. It differs from Newton’s mass point model in that the 

mass point model is only a geometric point without inner structures and only with a 

man-set property: mass, while Roton has a recursive, infinitely divisible “nucleated- 

revolving” structure. Mass point can be regarded as  a far distance approximation of 

Roton because when observed from a far distance, plenty of inner structures of Rotons 

are unobservable to the observer due to the distance. But when observed from a near 

distance, the details of the Roton structure are not neglectable. The Roton model has 

some  advantages  compared  with  mass  point  model  because  it  avoids  many 

singularities  resulting  from  the  zero  volume  of  a  geometric  point  representation  but 

still can be taken as a point when the cared scale are far larger than the scale of the 

diameter of the Roton.

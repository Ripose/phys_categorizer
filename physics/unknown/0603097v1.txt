ABSTRACT 

Using  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  principle  it  is  shown  that  the  gravitational  stability 

condition  for  a  crystalline  vacuum  cosmic  space  implies  to  obtain  an  equation  formally 

equivalent  to  the  relation  first  used  by  Gamow  to  predict  the  present  temperature  of  the 

microwave background from the matter density.  The compatibility condition between the 

quantum  and  the  relativistic  approaches  has  been  obtained  without  infinities  arising  from 

the quantum analysis or singularities arising from the relativistic theory.  The action which 

leads to our theory is the least action possible in a quantum scheme.  The energy fluctuation 
involved in the gravitational stabilization of vacuum space is 10-40 times the energy of the 

crystalline structure of vacuum space inside the present Universe volume.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The modern concept of a physical quantity in science follows that of Maxwell, where every 

expression of a quantity consists of two factors or components.  One is the chosen standard 

quantity technically called the unit, and the other is the number of units required to make up 

the  physical  quantity  [1].    From  this  conceptual  scheme  two  different  lines  have  been 

developed.  One, the most important from a practical point of view, attends to the necessity 

to provide the basic units for measurements used in science, technology and everyday life 

[2].    The  other  line  is  devoted  to  the  philosophical  search  for  a  deeper  foundation  of 

physical  constant;  see  for  instance  works  due to  Maxwell  [1],  Planck  [3]  and  Heisenberg 

Heisenberg’s  proposal  of  a  natural  system  of  units  of  measurement  based  on  universal 

constants is a very interesting one, and is justified as follows [4]:  “The universal constants 

determine the scale of nature, the characteristic quantities that cannot be reducing to other 

quantities.  One needs at least three fundamental units for a complete set of units.  A unit of 

length,  one  of  time  and  one  of  mass  is  sufficient  to  form  a  complete  set.    The  theory  of 

relativity  is  connected  with  a  universal  constant  in  nature,  the  velocity  of  light,  c.  The 

quantum theory is connected with another universal constant of nature, Planck’s quantum 

of action, h.  There must exist a third universal constant in nature, this is obvious for purely 

dimensional reasons. An only a theory which contains this third unit (constant) can possibly 

determine  the  masses  and  other  properties  of  the  elementary  particles.  Judging  from  our 

present  knowledge  of  these  particles  the  most  appropriate  way  to  introducing  the  third 

universal constant would be the assumption of a universal length the value of which should 
be  roughly  10-13cm,  that  is  some  what  smaller  than  the  radii  of  light  nuclei.  When  from 

such three units one forms an expression which in its dimensions corresponds to a mass, its 

value has the order of magnitude of the masses of the elementary particles”. 

[4].

Following  Heisenberg’s  proposal,  it  is  possible  to  consider  that  some  new  physical  result 

obtained in a previous paper [5] requires further analysis.  In particular the possibility that 

vacuum  cosmic  space  could  have  a  crystalline  structure,  with  a  lattice  parameter  rN  = 
ROU/1040 (rN similar to neutron radius) where ROU is the present Universe radius deserves a 

careful  exploration.  From  our  point  of  view  such  physical  analysis  requires  the  study  of 

compatibility conditions between the General Theory of Relativity and Quantum Theory as 

applied  to  the  crystalline  vacuum  cosmic  space  model.  This  because  a  theory  which 

physically  describes  the  metric  of  cosmic  space  and  its  evolution  and  a  quantum  theory 

which  allows  to  determine  the  masses  of  elementary  particles  (neutrons)  existing  in  such 

metric are simultaneously required to analyze such problem. 

The  main  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  study  the  immediate  implications  about  the 

gravitational  stability  of  a  model  which  considers  that  the  vacuum  cosmic  space  has  a 
crystalline structure with a lattice parameter of the order of the neutron radius rN ~ 10-13cm. 

2.  FORMALISM 

Our model for the vacuum cosmic space is an infinite crystalline structure characterized by 

a lattice parameter roughly the size of the neutron radius which is the distance between the 

physical entities that form the crystalline structure. Here vacuum means, by definition, the 

state of lowest or minimum energy per unit volume. The state  >0  is the state of crystalline 

structure  without  deformation.  According  to  Einstein’s  gravitational  theory,  in  this 

crystalline  structure  there  is  a  gravitational  attraction  between  such  physical  entities,  and 

also there appears an interaction between them due to crystalline lattice deformation.  These 

phenomena lead to a gravitational instability of such vacuum cosmic space. 

In nature we have a lot of systems which, in principle, are unstable against some kind of 

force but thanks to quantum forces which arise from Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle the 

system gets stability.  Here we mention two examples:  the atom and the nucleus.   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5

As we know, in the hydrogen atom, which classically is an unstable system, we can obtain 

stability  by  using  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  principle,  which  introduces  something  like  a 

compensatory quantum force, which stabilise, the system.

The main point here is that, in contrast to classical mechanics, the energy is bounded from 

below because of the uncertainty principle. 

Similarly, for the case of nuclear forces, in the deuteron the stability can be explained by 

using  again  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  principle,  or  in  nuclei  with  several  nucleons,  the 

stability can be achieved appealing to this principle as Yukawa did in 1935, explaining the 

nuclear force by the particles exchange, through the relation

Following  the  same  arguments  as  above,  we  can  extend  these  ideas  to  a  system  which 

interacts by gravitational forces. In the same way that Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is 

appealed for stabilizing a system like the hydrogen atom or a light nucleus, in this work this 

principle is used to prevent the collapse of a crystalline structure, which is our model for 

the vacuum cosmic space, due to the action of gravitational stresses.

  is  10120,  provided  that  ROU  is  the  radius  associated  to  the 

most  usual  value  for  the  Universe  age:    15000  millions  years.    Einstein’s  gravitational 

theory  states  that  such  physical  arrangement  is  unstable  under  the  action  of  long-range 

gravitational  stresses.    We  can  restore  the  equilibrium  or  stability  of  this  system  around 

average gravitational stresses with zero value by using Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.  

Each of the NCVS entities inside VOU behaves as a linear harmonic oscillator.  In general we 

have 3NCVS degrees of freedom in this system for vibration modes [6], but due to the radial 

symmetry  of  the  gravitation  interaction  we  have  only  NCVS  degrees  of  freedom,  which 

correspond to 3NCVS linear one dimensional harmonic oscillators.  Each of the NCVS physical 

entities of the crystalline vacuum cosmic space inside the volume VOU, contributes with a

responsible for the gravitational stability of the vacuum cosmic crystalline structure.

It is important to note that in the three cases that we have considered, the stabilization of 

fundamental  physical  systems  against  instabilities  arising  from  electromagnetic  forces, 

nuclear forces and gravitational forces which has led to Eqs. (1), (2) and (4), the stability 

radii  are  inversely  proportional  to  the  rest  energy  (self-energy)  of  the  “particle”  which  is 

orbiting.  For  the  three  cases  the  De-Broglie  matter  theory  [7]  states  that  each  “particle” 

orbiting  around  a  radius  r ,  satisfies  the  De-  Broglie  relation 

r =)(λ

  ,  where 

p

  is  the

momentum of the orbiting physical entity, circling in a stationary wave. 

For low frequencies, the relation between absolute temperature, T, and the photoenergy [8, 

9] is given by:

where 

k

  is  the  Boltzman  constant.    In  addition,  for  weak  gravitational  fields,  which 

correspond  to  the  linear  region  of  the  Einstein’s  equations,  there  is  a  strong  analogy 

between  Maxwell’s  and  Einstein’s  equations,  so  electromagnetic  and  gravitational  waves 

have  a  similar  behaviour.  We  assume  then  that  Eq.  (6)  is  also  satisfied  by  gravitational 

waves, leading to

The  resemblance  between  Eqs.  (20)  and  (21)  is  evident.    However  Eq.  (20)  refers  to  a 

physical situation of an adiabatic process of compression of gravitational waves under their 

own interaction, whereas Eq. (21) refers to the adiabatic expansion of matter after the Big 

Bang. In fact, the  physical process which leads to Eq. (20) explains the possibility  of the 

Big  Bang  event  without  singularities,  as  a  transformation  process  of  the  fundamental 

gravitational quanta, mentioned before, into matter quanta.

3.   DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

3.1. By using Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle it has been shown that the vacuum cosmic 

space could be gravitationally stable.  The model for such vacuum space is crystalline 

with  a  lattice  parameter  of  the  order  of  the  neutron  radius  and  the  volume  used  to 

obtain  gravitation  stability  from  the  collective  quantum  fluctuations  is  about  the 

present Universe volume.  Then Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle allows to stabilise 

not  only  microscopical  systems  against  electromagnetic  or  nuclear  forces  but  also  to 

stabilise macroscopically system against gravitational forces. 

3.2. The  big  bang  would  have  resulted  from  a  previous  adiabatic  compression  process  of 

gravitational  waves.    In  other  words,  from  the  analysis  of  the  adiabatic  process  of 

compression  between  the  gravitational  waves,  which  stabilises  the  vacuum  cosmic 

space with crystalline structure, an equation which describes the relationship between 

temperature, radial distance and gravitational wave energy density has been obtained, 

Eq. (20).  Such an equation is formally equal to the equation used by Gamow’s team to 

predict the present microwave temperature background from the density of matter, Eq. 

(21).    This  last  equation  has  been  obtained  by  Gamow  from  the  General  Relativity 

Theory  applied  to  the  big  bang  event,  in  particular  arising  from  the  Friedmann-

Robertson-Walker Equation.  But Eq. (20) is also formally identical to a previous result 

obtained  by  Homer  Lane  in  1869,  called  by  Chandrasekhar  “The  Lane’s  Theorem” 

[14].  

In  a  global  way,  by  using  energy  conservation,  we  show  that  10120  quantum  of 

gravitation  energy,  each  one  with  an  energy 

h
=ν
OU

Rc /h

OU

,  becomes  into  1080 

neutrons  as  required  by  the  Gamow  analysis  previously  mentioned.    By  using  the 

energy  conservation  principle  it  is  possible  to  show  that  the  diminishing  in  the 

gravitational  energy  of  the  crystalline  gravitational  field  during  the  adiabatic 

compression  of  the  gravitational  waves  from  ROU  to  the  radius  which  envelopes  the 
1080 neutrons formed at the end of the contraction phase is the energy source required 

 

to produce an electromagnetic radiation with a total energy of 1013 EOU = 1093uN.  This 

physical  consideration  gives  the  conditions  for  a  hot  big  bang  in  our  theoretical 

scheme.  The expansion cycle will be treated at detail in a future paper.

3.3. Conditions for compatibility between the quantum analysis of the gravitational stability 

of  the  vacuum  space  and  the  relativistic  analysis  of  the  big  bang  has  been  obtained 

without infinities arising from the quantum analysis or singularities appearing from the 

relativistic theory. 

3.4. Our theoretical analysis is in agreement with the least action principle but also it is not 

possible, by theoretical construction, that any other model exhibits a least action than 

our model.  The required action for our model is more o less equal to that involved in 

the Gamow approach. 

3.5. At difference of the big bang theory, our scheme is a theory with initial conditions; this 

characteristic opens up the possibility that its predictive power will be greater than the 

big bang theory. 

3.6. In our crystalline structure scheme of vacuum cosmic space a relativistic theory for the 

big bang does not violate the energy conservation principle; but the standard big bang 

theory does.    This  is because  on the one hand, in our scheme the crystalline vacuum 

cosmic  space  is  an  eternal  structure  and  the  energetic  fluctuation  involved  in  the 
gravitational  stabilisation  of  each  volume  Vou  is  about  10-40  of  the  energy  per  unit 

volume of the crystalline vacuum cosmic space which is compatible with Heisenberg’s 

uncertainty principle.  And on the other hand, in the standard theory of the big bang the 

vacuum cosmic space is growing together with the Universe expansion.  The Friedman 

-  Robertson  -  Walker  equation  obeys  the  energy  conservation  by  neglecting  the 

quantum energy arising from the increase of the vacuum cosmic space volume, which 

for cosmological volumes is a huge quantity.

3.7. It  is  clear  that  in  our  scheme  the  only  energy  which  enters  in  the  Einstein’s  field 

equations  is  due  to  the  long  -  range  quantum  fluctuations  of  the  crystalline  vacuum 

cosmic  space  in  the  form  of  gravitational  waves,  electromagnetic  energy  and  matter 

and antimatter. 

3.8. This  work  links  a  quantum  analysis  about  collective  interactions  between  all  the 

elements of a macroscopically system with a non - quantum relativistic cosmological 

model which has an objective physical reality.   In our analysis an objective quantum 

picture of the crystalline vacuum cosmic space arising from the long - range interaction 

between their lattice entities appears.  This conclusion contradicts the Neils Bohr and 

Stephen  Hawking  consideration  (among  few  other)  about  that  there  is  no  objective 

picture  at  all,  and  which  considers  that:  actually  there  is  nothing  “out  there”  at  the 

quantum  level.    Some  how,  reality  emerges  only  in  relation  to  the  results  of 

“measurements”  made  by  human  beings.    Quantum  theory,  according  to  this  view, 

provides merely a calculation procedure and does not attempt to describe the world as 

it actually “is”.  Following Penrose’s  [15] and Barrow’s analysis [16] it is clear that 

both  Bohr’s    and  Hawking’s  analysis  mislead  the  point  by  confusing  between 

“measurement”  made  by  human  observers  and  interaction.    Interactions  which  occur 

between any physical entities all the time in all the places of the Universe governed by 

Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  principle  as  has  been  shown  here  and  in  many  other 

applications do no require the existence of human beings to take place.  In other words, 

according to our model the physical reality at quantum level as applied to the so called 

Universe does not require the presence of a conscious being to exist. 

3.9. There  are  many  problems  which  remain  to  be  solved  in  our  theoretical  scheme  for 

instance:    the  thermodynamical  aspects  related  to  the  formation  of  quantum  matter 

packages, the evaluation of the cosmological constant implied by our model, the very 

low entropy value at the starting of the big bang, the quantum aspects of the formation 

process of the quantum matter packages, the relation between the matter and antimatter 

production, etc.  All these problems will be addressed in further contributions.

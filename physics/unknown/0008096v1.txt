Abstract

The Coupled Cavity Drift Tube Linac (CCDTL) used
in the Accelerator for the Production of Tritium (APT) is
fully  described  elsewhere  [1]. 
  The  modules  are
composed of several machined and brazed segments that
must  account  for  the  accumulation  of  dimensional
tolerances in the build up of the stack.  In addition, space
requirements  dictate  that  power  fed  to  the  accelerator
cannot be through the accelerating cavities.  As well, we
would like to remove a single segment of the accelerator
without 
  These
requirements combined with phasing relationships of the
design and space limitations have resulted in a different
bridge  coupling  method  used  in  the  module  comprising
3-gap  segments. 
  The  coupling  method,  phasing
relationships  and  other

flexibility of the design will be discussed.

1  BRIDGE COUPLER DESIGN

The  Bridge  Coupler  below  addresses  all  of  the  above
problems.  A  unique  feature  is  the  ability  to  take  up
tolerances, and employ the design over a  wide range of
particle  velocities.    The  center  cavity  is  bent  into  a  U,
where  the  distance  between  the  legs  may  vary,  while
maintaining a total constant length.  This accommodates
different spacing between Accelerator Cavities (AC). The
bridge coupler  consists  of  an  odd  number  of  cavities  in
order  to  preserve  the  p /2  operating  mode  of  the  RF
structure.    Figure  1  shows  the  basic  bridge  coupler
design.    The  concept  uses  TM01  mode  pillbox  cavities,
with  axes  parallel  to  the  accelerator  center-line.    A
unique  aspect  of  this  structure  is  that  due  to  phasing
requirements,  the  center  cavity  is  no  longer  a  pill  box
cavity, but has been replaced with a waveguide operating
in  a  TE013  mode.  Figure  2  defines  the  relative  phase
differences,  shown  with  arrows,  for  the  segments  being
coupled.    The  two  Coupling  Cavities  (CC)  (see  Fig.  1)
are unexcited in the p /2 mode, while the center cavity is
excited to a power level determined by the relative sizes
of  the  coupling  slots  shown.    Since  the  center  cavity  is
excited,  RF  power  can  be  fed  directly  into  it  through  a
slot coupled to a waveguide.

The fields from the AC couple in the same direction as
the  CC.  The  fields  from  the  center  cavity  couple  in
opposite  directions  so  there  is  zero  energy  in  the  CC’s.
The waveguide in Fig. 3 has its ends folded down.  This
gives the required 180(cid:176)  phase change at the guide.

3  MAIN FEATURES

•  Coupling  cavities  and  the  center  cavity  have  noses

used for tuning.

•  The coupling cavities are split along a plane parallel
to  the  accelerator  center-line.    A  vacuum  flange  is
seated here.   Once disassembled a single segment of
the  accelerator  can  be  removed  without  removing
additional segments.

•  The  center  cavity  is  a  waveguide  bent  into  a  U
shape.    The  distance  between  the  ACs  can  vary,
while  keeping 
the
resonant frequency unchanged.

the  waveguide 

length  and 

•  The  center  cavity  noses  nearest  the  coupling  slots
enhance  the  fields  locally.    This  increases  the
coupling between the center cavity and CCs.

•  The  center  cavity  resonates  in  the  TE013  mode  in
order to provide the correct relative 1800 RF phasing
of  the  accelerating  cavities.    The  tuning  noses  are
located at electric field maxima.

•  The  relative  sizes  of  the  center  cavity  tuning  noses
near the coupling slots can be adjusted to mix in a
lower order mode (TE012) to give different H fields at
the slots while maintaining  resonant frequency.

•  Designate the AC and CC as 1,2 in the left hand side
of Fig. 1.  Then the coupling (k12) is proportional to
the slot size, the product H1*H2, divided by (cid:214) (U1U2).
The slot size is calculated by a special routine within
the  program  CCT  [2],  developed  by  General
Atomics.  For the p /2 mode the energy in cavity 1 is
related  to  the  energy  in  cavity  3  by  the  following
relationship: k12(cid:214) U1=k23(cid:214) U3.

•  Slots leading from the end of CC (2) into the center
cavity (3) are semi-circular.  This is done to enhance
the H fields near the slot.  See Fig.  4  below.  The
slot  protruding  into  the  waveguide  enhances  the
action of the fields.

•  Coupling to an RF feed waveguide is accomplished
by  means  of  the  slot  labeled  Center  Cavity  Power
Feed Slot (see Fig. 1).  Two slots are incorporated.

•  A chamfered post on the CC reduces the fields at the
edge  of  the  post.    Also  by  reducing  the  post
diameter, the tuning sensitivity is reduced.  See Fig.
5 below.

Sensitivity.

4 LOCATION OF COUPLING CAVITY
The coupling cavity slot is placed in a high magnetic
field area.  Elevating the position of the CC relative to
the center axis of the AC insures there is only magnetic
coupling through the slot.  If the coupling slot is located
further down from the top of the AC both electric and
magnetic coupling terms are present.   These terms are of
opposite sign and add complexity to the design
calculations.

Raising the elevation of the coupling cavities

introduced some intricacies to the mechanical design.
The CC has an unsymmetrical split that is no longer
through the center line (see Fig. 1).  If the CC had a low
elevation, chamfering the slot would have cut into the
second half of the CC.

5 GENERAL DESIGN PROCEDURES

The 2D cavities, without slots, are designed so that after
the coupling slots are cut, giving the proper coupling, the
structure  resonates  at  the  proper  p /2  mode  frequency.
This  usually  means  that  a  series  of  iterations  are
performed  to  arrive  at  a  self-consistent  solution.    This
procedure is outlined in [2].  In addition for the Coupled
Cavity Drift Tube Linac, posts connect the drift tube (see
Fig.  4).    These  posts  are  used  for  support  and  act  as
cooling passages to the drift tube.   Coupling slots lower
the  frequency,  while  posts  raise  the  cavity  frequency.
Similarly this effect is included in the iterative procedure
described in [2].

When  apertures  (slots)  are  cut  in  a  wall  common  to
adjacent RF cavities, they will be coupled magnetically,

electrically,  or  a  combination  depending  upon  slot
location. The magnitude of the coupling  depends on the
fields in the two cavities at the location of the slot  and on
their stored energies. These fields and stored energies are
calculated for unperturbed cavities (without slots).  If the
cavities are axially symmetric, 2-D codes can be used or,
if the  geometries are simple (such as rectangular), hand
calculations  are  possible.    Most  of  the  coupling  is

8 CENTER CAVITY TO WAVEGUIDE

IRIS FEED

The waveguide coupling factor (b ) for a cavity coupled
to a waveguide can be defined as the ratio of the power
emitted  from  the  cavity  into  the  waveguide  (through  a
slot)  to  the  power  dissipated  in  the  cavity  walls.    This
calculation again lends itself to perturbation analysis [ 5].
The  waveguide  coupling  factor  is  also  related  to  the
voltage  standing  wave  ratio  (VSWR)  in  the  waveguide.
If  the  waveguide  is  over-coupled,  b
  is  equal  to  the
VSWR,  while,  if  the  waveguide  is  under-coupled,  b
  is
equal to 1/VSWR.

For a rectangular slot, the equivalent area is placed in
an ellipse, with the major axis one-half the length of the
rectangular slot.

The power is related to the total power per feed.  One
feed  supplies  power  for  several  AC  cells  and  an
associated  number  of  bridge  coupler  center  cells.    The
power  for  the  AC  cells  comes  from  Superfish.    The
power  for  the  center  cavity  cells  may  be  calculated  by
using Ref. [4].

9 CONCLUSION

We have developed a  bridge coupler employing a  3/2
l g  waveguide-center  cavity.    The  design  incorporates  a
split  in  the  upper  half  allowing  small  segments  of  the
accelerator to be removed.  The design has the ability to
stretch  the  distance  between  AC  cavities.    Using  the
design  code  developed  by  General  Atomics  gives  the
designer greater freedom.

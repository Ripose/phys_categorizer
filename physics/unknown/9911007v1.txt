 Or on the Nature of Dark Matter

Ernst Karl Kunst

As has been shown before (a brief comment will be given in the text), relativistic
mass and relativistic time dilation of moving bodies are equivalent as well as
time and mass in the rest frame. This implies that the time dilation due to the
gravitational field is combined with inertial and gravitational mass as well and
permits the computation of the gravitational action of the vacuum constituting
the gravitational field in any distance from the source of the field. Theoretical
predictions are compared with experimental results and it is shown that many
known astrophysical and gravitational phenomena, especially the so-called dark
or missing matter, owe their existence to the gravitational effects of the mass of
the field-vacuum.

Key words: Equivalence of mass, energy and dilated time of moving bodies - mass of
the gravitational field 

Introduction

Apparent deviations from the Einstein-Newtonian law of gravitation both on laboratory
and  astronomical  scale  have  been  known  long  since.  Those  partly  controversially
discussed gravitational phenomena are:

1)  Constantly  high  velocities  of  individual  galaxies  within  clusters  and
groups of galaxies, departing strongly from the velocities on the strength
of the virial law and constantly high orbital velocities in the vicinity of the
Milky Way, other galaxies and galaxy pairs, which deviate strongly from
a  Keplerian  velocity  distribution.    Both  phenomena  have  led  to  the
currently accepted concept of non-luminous, non-baryonic material in the
vicinity of large systems on a cosmic scale, the so-called "halo of dark
unseen matter" [1], [2];

2)  An  apparent  increase  of  the  universal  gravitational  constant  G  with
growing  radial  distance  of  test  masses  measured  with  the  torsion
pendulum in the laboratory [3];

3)  A  systematic  increase  of  the  gravitional  acceleration  g  as  one
descends into deep mineshafts or boreholes [4], [5], [6], or decrease as
one ascends towers [7]; 

4) A systematic linear deviation of the acceleration of two test masses at
the  ends  of  the  torsion  pendulum  in  the  gravitational  field  of  Earth  in
proportion to the difference in baryon density (protons plus neutrons per
unit  mass),  which  was  found  by  analytical  replication  of  the  original
Eötvös data and led to the suggestion of a composition-dependent finite
range repulsive ( fifth ) force [8];

5) A systematic decrease of the velocity of space-probes on their track

In the following we will show that all these experimentally found though - as already
stated - partly controversially discussed phenomena are due to the gravitational effects
of the mass of the gravitational field.

Connection between Relativistic Mass and Dilated Time of Moving Bodies

Main results of the modified theory of relativistic kinematics among others are inertial
motion (velocity) always to be symmetrically composite and the Lorentz transformation
not to predict the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction of the dimension ((cid:12)x) parallel to the
velocity vector, as invented by Fitzgerald and Lorentz to account for the null-result of
the Michelson-Morley experiment on moving Earth, but rather an expansion of (cid:12)x [10].
Accordingly the volume V’ of an inertially moving body will any observer resting in a
frame considered at rest seem enhanced by the factor

V (cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:12)x (cid:12) (cid:12)y (cid:12) (cid:12)z (cid:12) (cid:10)(cid:10) (cid:12)x (cid:11)0 (cid:12)y (cid:12)z(cid:10)(cid:10) V (cid:11)0 ,

(1)

 

0 

where V means volume and (cid:11) the Lorentz factor based on the composite velocity v .
0
Among others it has been demonstrated this expansion of (cid:12)x (or V) to be the cause of
the experimentally found increase of the interaction radius respectively cross section
of  elementary  particles  with  rising  energy  (velocity),  as  determined  in  collider
experiments and as is known from studies of cosmic radiation. From m’ = V’'’ = m(cid:11)  =0
V'(cid:11)   in  connection  with  (1)  follows  '’  =  '  and,  therewith,  the  fraction  v /c  of  the
relativistically dilated time to be the very cause of the relativistic increase of mass:

Analogous to the equivalence of mass and time in the rest frame as well as in the
moving  one  gravitational  fields  have  to  be  considered  to  be  spaces  with  relativistic
mass, because of the time dilation due to the gravitational field. Thus, we can expect

3

the potential differences in gravitational fields in dependence on the distance from the
source of the field to be perceptible as physically measurable masses. To compute
those masses basically two possibilities exist. 
 

Global Estimate of the Mass of the Gravitational Field

We refer to the classical definition of mass as the product of volume and density and
then in accord with (2) can write

EV

(cid:10)(cid:10) mV c 2 (cid:10)(cid:10) dt (cid:12) c v0 × c dy dz(cid:10)(cid:10) V (cid:12)(cid:12) c v0 ,

if  v   «  c  and  dt/dt’  (cid:17)  1,  where  E   means  energy  and  m   mass  of  volume  of  space
(vacuum), respectively. Of course, (3) is valid in the case of moving bodies only, with
one velocity vector. 
Suppose  we  have  a  spherically  symmetric  gravitational  field  in  the  form  of  a
Schwarzschild-vacuole in the Friedmann cosmos

where "r" means the coordinate radius of the vacuole and "N" the "radius", "K" means
curvature, "M" the mass of the central body under consideration [12]. In this case the
product of each of the three dimensions of the vacuole and the velocity vector or (in
Newtonian approximation) scalar of curvature

whereby "G" is the Newton's gravitational constant and "R " the radius of the mass of
the central body, distributed in the vacuole. Here we had to consider that each of the
three geometric dimensions of the gravitational field must  be multiplied by the scalar
of  curvature  or  (in  approximation)  vector  of  velocity,  according  to  the  principle  of
equivalence. On the grounds of the ratio

mass of the gravitational field of the vacuole with the expression

Accordingly  the  ratio  of  the  "total  mass  of  the  gravitational  system"  (field  +  visible
mass) to the "visible mass" is

Applying the corresponding values for galaxies and galaxy clusters, roughly the right
amount of masses results i.e. greater than the visible masses which were introduced
by astronomers as the so called "dark or missing matter", to explain the dynamics of
large complexes of gravitational systems. The uncertainties in the determination of the
cosmic density '  and especially of R  (boundary between the external and internal
Schwarzschild metric) in extended gravitational systems e.g. galaxies and clusters of
galaxies allow but only very global estimates.

The Mass of the Gravitational Field in Dependence on the Distance from 
the Source of Gravitation

More exact results can be derived if, starting at the boundary between the external and
internal Schwarzschild metric of a spherical distribution of mass (source of the external
field or radius of the mass in Euclidian coordinates), the infinitesimal small distances
respectively  multiplied  by  the  time  dilation  at  the  point  of  the  coordinate  in  radial
direction are summed. Consider the center of gravity of the field-producing mass to be
at rest, with T  being the essential component of the energy momentum tensor T  so
that in a first approximation is valid

Furthermore, the vacuum of the external Schwarzschild metric is considered to consist
of thin concentric shells of the thickness dR, where “R” is the distance from the center
of  gravity.  According  to  (4)  the  mass  of  each  infinitesimal  thin  concentric  shell
measured  from  the  point  R   radially  "within"  the  field  must  be  proportional  to  the
infinitesimal small distance dR:

The volume of each successive shell increases as the square of the radius. On the
other hand the velocity v  decreases inversely proportional to the radius, i.e. the cube
of  the  velocity v  with increasing radius, as 1/R  . As a result, the product of each
successive shell by the cube of the respective velocity remains constant. Thus, the
mass of the vacuum of each successive shell of the gravitational field remains constant
for all R. Because

("radius"  of  the  mass),  R  the  radial  distance  from  the  center  of  gravity  of  the  field
producing mass, measured in Euclidean coordinates. The constant (cid:26) is the mass of
the macroscopic groundstate of vacuo (not disturbed by gravitational fields), which is
null, and M  the mass of the vacuum of the gravitational field in the distance R from
the  center  of  gravity  which  together  with  the  field-producing  mass  M  or  the  energy
momentum tensor T , respectively, determines completely the behaviour of test bodies
of the mass m.

In principle this result is also valid for the internal Schwarzschild metric, because the
space inside a gravitational body contributes to the total mass of the body or density of
energy T  in the distance R  from the center of gravity (in approximation):

Thus, if R < R  the mass of the gravitational field inside the mass also amounts to the
value (5), measured from the point R  in negative radial direction or toward the center
of gravity.

Computation results in the flat non-Keplerian rotation curves of galaxies and pairs of

perceptible mass within the distance R of the gravitational field - baryonic plus field - to
the  amount  of 
luminous  matter,  which  agrees  well  with  astronomical
measurements.  In  the  following  we  compare  theoretically  derived  values  of  M /Mtotal

2)  From  the  preceding  is  evident  that  measurements  of  the  R-dependence  of  the
acceleration in local fields of gravitation must yield apparent discrepancies to Einstein-
Newtonian  gravity,  which  usually  are  interpreted  either  as  a  modification  of  the
gravitational constant G or as the effect of an additional (fifth) force of nature. A direct
measurement of the gravitational force f, which a unit of mass M = 1 exerts on a test
mass  m  in  the  distance  R  from  the  center  of  gravity  results  according  to  (5)  in  an
additional acceleration:

Consistently higher values of G from measurements of g in boreholes and mines for
some time have been known to point to a deviation from the 1/R-law of the gravitational
potential.  Therefore,  a  direct  comparison  of  this  theory  with  experimental  results  is
possible. In the following we compare some results of Stacey [4], Holding [5] and Hsui
[6] from measurements in boreholes and mines with calculations according to (10):

4)  A  look  at  (10)  shows  that  the  apparent  alteration  of  G  due  to  the  mass  of  the
gravitational field should not only be dependent on the distance R, but also on the
composition of the material of the attracted mass. The reason is that if R = constant,
then the fraction R /R, and thereby the difference ((cid:8)R - (cid:8)R ), differs with the density '
of the material. The density ' is the determining parameter and it is clear that ' is
appproximately  related  to  the  difference  in  baryonic  density.  In  other  words,  we
assume the mass of the field vacuum also to play a passive role as attracted mass. For
convenience we choose

constituting the density of H O as the reference value. Because stock density varies
inversely to the volume per unit mass, relative to H O the radius R  of the unit mass of
all materials other than H O varies as 1/ (cid:8)' so that (5) attains the form:

As compared with the mass of the gravitational field of an unit mass H O, which we
arbitrarily set zero, the mass of the field of the unit mass of a material other than H O2
varies as (1 - 1/ (cid:8)'). Correspondingly, the gravitational force acting upon a test mass
in  a  locally  (almost)  homogeneous  field,  particularly  that  of  Earth,  must  vary
proportional to the density of the test body as:

Fischbach's  analysis  of  the  old  Eötvös  data  includes  among  others  three  pairs  of
sample  material:  H O-Cu,  asbestos-Cu  and  Pt-Cu  [8].  The  experimental  results  for
these pairs are very convenient for a comparison with theory. Computation of (11) and
comparison with the results of Fischbach-Eötvös in g(g) × 10  results in (experiment in

Pioneer 10 is currently 71 times as far from the sun as Earth is. According to (12) the
gravitational pull of the field vacuum of the sun in this distance R (cid:17) 1.06216 × 10  cm15
onto the spacecraft must be GM /R  = 10.51 × 10  cm s  - where M  = 2 × 10  g and
R  = 1.428 × 10  cm, the mean distance of Saturn from the sun -, whereas Anderson
reported an experimentally found acceleration of (cid:17) 8.5 × 10  cm s  toward the sun [9].
To choose the proper value of R  in (12) it had to be considered that analogous to the
case of the Milky Way astronomical measurements are grounded on the validity of the
Newton-Keplerian law within the orbit of Saturn, or with other words: in all computations
on the grounds of Einstein-Newtonian gravitation the mass of the field vacuum of the
sun (and of the planets) is at least till the orbit of Saturn included in the mass of the
sun. If R  = 2.872 × 10  cm - the mean distance of Uranus - (12) yields 7.97 × 10  cm
s .  Besides  we  have  to  expect  that  the  straightforward  application  of  (12)  to  the
gravitational field of the sun is restricted for the following reasons:
If the mean distances between the planets are listed in A. U. according to the Titius-
Bode  law  (which  with  the  exception  of  Pluto  correspond  roughly  to  the  observed
distances) the following ratios result:

Because - as shown before - the mass of each successive shell (being proportional to
the distances between the planets or the "thickness" of the shells) of the gravitational
field  of  the  sun  remains  constant,  the  above  ratios  seem  to  indicate  that  in  the
protoplanetary disk and later the planets positioned more or less exactly between field
shells of equal mass. This can be described as

(cid:10)(cid:10) 2n

where n = 1, 2, 3,...n and r  = 1. Inserting r  = 0.4 in (13) delivers again the Titius-Bode
1
law  2  × 0.3 + 0.4. It s clear that all r > r  depend on the value of r , which again
cannot  be  derived  from  (13).  Obviously  is  the  simple  rule  of  balance  of  field  mass
shells, developed above, not straightforwardly applicable to the three innermost solar
planets. But if our hypothesis is correct, must their distances from the sun also depend
on the balance of the field masses. Hence they should tend to take positions between
three shells of equal  mass at (in arbitrary units) r  = 0.33, r  = 0.66 and r  = 1. On the
other hand there must exist a tendency to form three shells at r  = 0.5, r  = 0.75 and
again r  = 1 to reach a balance 0.5 : 0.5. As a consequence the planets tend to take
position between r  = 0.33 and 0.5, which results in r  = 0.41, and r  = 0.66 respectively
0.75, which results in r  = 0.71.
Thus, if this hypothesis is correct, it must be valid for any system, where at least three
objects (with a similiar genesis as the planets of the sun) orbit a central mass. If always
r  = 1 (in the case of Saturn the mean distance of Tethys to Calypso) we find for the
3
two innermost objects e. g. in the system of the sun r  = 0.39 and r  = 0.72, Jupiter r
1
= 0.39 and r  = 0.63, Saturn r  = 0.49 (mean distance of Atlas to Epimetheus) and r  =
0.72 (mean distance of Mimas and Enceladus), Uranus r  = 0.48 and r  = 0.72, the
pulsar PSR 1257 + 12 r  = 0.4 and r  = 0.77, and the pulsar PSR 1828 - 11 r  = 0.44,
and r  = 0.63, respectively.

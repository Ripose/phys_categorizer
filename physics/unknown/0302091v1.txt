Abstract

All  physical  process  are  subject  to  some  laws  which  determine  with  math

accurately its time-space evolution. These laws are described, in the last analysis for the

principle  of  causality.  The  physical  space  can  be  homogeneous  or  heterogeneous  in

function  of  the  distribution  of  the  physical  magnitudes.  Applying  the  principle  of

causality  to  the  homogeneous  space  we  observe  that  its  more  important  qualities  are:

their  metric  does  not  depend  of  the  4coordeninate  where  it  is  measured  and  the  light

speed constancy [1]. However, to apply the principle of causality in the heterogeneous

space is very much fruitful. Thanks to the presence of physical magnitudes that vary in

the 4space we can find the equations that this magnitudes should verify so that it takes

place their space and time evolution.

Working  on  the  principle  of  causality  like  axiom  for  describe  our  physical

systems, we will obtain the most basic expression of evolution of the magnitudes of the

physical system. This expression coincides with the principle of action expressed for a

tensorial  action  [2].  The  scalar  form  of  this  principle  coincides,  in  its  turn,  with  the

traditional relativistic and quantum expression, of the principle of action or principle of

least action according to other authors.

Introduction.

The whole science is based on an unique principle well-known as the principle

of  causality  [3].  This  principle  can  enunciate  as:  “all  event  comes  determined  by  the

history of previous events. To these previous events we called causes and to the  event

that  determine  we  called  effect.”  This  principle  is  so  essential  because  “it  is  verify

independently  of  the  reference  frame  that  we  use.”  To  apply  this  principle  to  the

homogeneous  systems  forces  us,  for  not  breaking  the  homogeneity  of  the  system,  to

consider the causes and the effects like external events to our system.

For this reason, the unique consequence that we can deduce from the principle of

causality applied to the homogeneous spaces is that one deduces from the propagation

of the sign (luminous).

However, in the heterogeneous space we can apply all the power of the principle

of  causality  and  in  this  form  to  obtain  the  equations  of  space-time  evolution  of  these

systems.

The heterogeneous system.

It  is  defined  the  heterogeneous  system  as  that  physical  system  which  has

characteristic differentiating from some regions to others. Such characteristics are due to

the  existence  of  physical  magnitudes  whose  values  varies  in  function  of  the  4-

coordinateses in which are measured.

Since, when a physical system is heterogeneous it is not homogeneous, then its

metric, cannot be constant in all the points of the system, that is to say, the metric of a

heterogeneous  system  is  variable  with  the  coordinateses  of  the  4point  in  which  we

measure it: G = G (X).

Although  the  metric  is  not  constant,  for  the  properties  of  the  distance,  it

continues being symmetrical. By virtue of this symmetry we always will be able to find

for each point of the system a reference frame, together with a units system in the one

which,  the  metric  is  similar  to 

0G .  This  principle  is  known  like  principle  of  strong

equivalence.

pattern.

The concept of physical magnitude.

A physical magnitude is a quality of  (or in) the 4space that it is characterized by

to be comparable and scalable with another quality of  the  same type to  which  we  call

The  fact  of  observe  a  physical  magnitude  in  our  system  assures  us  that  the

system  is not  homogeneous.  Any  hypothesis  of  homogeneity  on  our  system  would  be

annulled  as  soon  as  we  could  detect  the  presence  of  a  physical  magnitude,  since  this,

would characterize at the 4region of the space where it showed, in front of the rest of the

regions of the system.

The concept of physical magnitude is an abstraction that traditionally has united

to the concept of matter and not to the space. This way, the mass or the electrical charge

are considered physical magnitudes, while the electric, magnetic or gravitational fields

are considered, rather, qualities of the space. However, these fields have units systems,

and  places  of  the  space  in  which  are  measured  their  values.  Therefore,  we  will  also

include them in the concept of physical magnitude.

In  this  form,  the  physical  magnitude  will  adopt  the  most  general  form  of  its

definition: “quality of (or in) the 4space that it is characterized by to be comparable and

scalable with another quality of the same type to which we call pattern.”

The  physical  magnitudes  have,  by  virtue  of  their  definition,  a  mathematical

representation. This mathematical representation can make in many forms and in fact it

has  gone  changing  along  the  history  according  to  the  necessities  of  the  mathematical

apparatus that it has used in each time. Today in day  the mass or the  electrical charge

are considered like a to scalar (tensor of order 0), the electrical field strength is a vector

(tensor  of  1º  order),  the  electromagnetic  field  is  a  matrix  (tensor  of  2º  order)  or  the

gravitational field like a tensor of 4º order [4].

In  a  general  form  we  can  say  that,  using  the  differential  geometry,  the  present

physical magnitude in a point of the system can be represented by a mathematical object
of range n that is applied in a system  Ω  [5]. That is to say: P is a physical magnitude if

The particular realization that is made of the physical magnitudes will depend in

each  case  of  the  purpose.  In  a  purely  mechanical  analysis  of  material  points  the

magnitudes  that  will  interest  us  will  be  the  masses  and  speeds  of  each  one  of  the

particles  of  the  system.  These  magnitudes  are  carried  out  in  the  concept  of  lineal

moment, being mi the mass and vi the speed of the i  particle:

Equally,  for  an  electrodynamic  system,  the  magnitude  would  be  carried  out  in

the next form:

Being  m the mass  distribution,  v the speed,  e  electric distribution of  charge  and  A  the

gauge potential of the electromagnetic field.

In  the  analysis  that  we  will  continue  hereinafter,  we  will  do  without  the

mathematical  representation  of  the  physical  magnitudes  and  we  will  centre  in  looking

for that mathematical expression describes to our physical system.

Principle of causality and physical magnitudes.

The  principle  of  causality,  just  as  it  is  enunciated  in  any  dictionary,  says  “all

event comes determined by the history of previous events. To these previous events we

called causes and to the event that they determine we called effect."

This principle can to be applicable to the physics with some considerations:

An  event  is  a  circumstance  that  characterizes  a  point  or  region  of  the  4space,

differing of  its neighbourhood.

Considering the definitions of heterogeneous space and physical magnitude, it is

clear that an event, what manifests is a physical magnitude that differentiates a region of

the 4space.

In  these  circumstances,  the principle  of  causality  is  translated  by:  “all  physical

magnitude comes determined by the history of previous physical magnitudes.”

Since  the  physical  magnitudes  are  represented  by  mathematical  objects,  this

determinism  is  translated  in  mathematical  expressions  that  connect  the  physical

magnitudes “cause” with the physical magnitudes “effects”.

Evolution of a physical system.

We  begin,  then,  from  a  physical  system  in  which  there  are  some  physical

magnitudes represented by a mathematical object of degree n to which we represent by

P(X).

the system.

We  will  call  evolution  of  our  physical  system  to  the  mathematical  expression

that shows us how vary the physical magnitudes in function of the 4coordinates, inside

The variation of the magnitudes, in function of the dimensions, when these they

are discreet, is totalled according to the expression:  ∑

the integral function. In this case P represent a distribution density of the magnitudes in

function of the 4coordinates of the system.

According to this, the evolution of a physical system  Ω  comes determined by a

1−n

 differential form [5] that is defined as:

A  more  compact  notation  of  this  expression  would  be,  using  the  differential

geometry:

The  expressions  (1)  and  (2),  if  we  work  in  the  classic  space,  in  Cartesian

coordinates, we can reduce them to a more traditional form:

When  P  is  a  vector,  S  will  be  a  scalar.  Then,  the  expression  (2)  will  take  the

form:

These  last  two  expressions  indicate  us  that,  in  the  classic  space,  in  Cartesian

coordinates  and  being  P  a  vector  and  therefore  S  a  scalar,  S  coincides  with  the

expression of the action function when this is function of the coordinateses and P with

the moment of the system.

This fact is not fortuitous. We have began from that P is the representation of the

magnitudes of the system and S is the evolution of the system. On the other hand, the

action, just as it describes by the analytic physics, is the mathematical  expression that

describes  to  a  physical  system  and  the  moment  of  the  system  is  which  includes  the

physical magnitudes and as their interactions.

However,  in  our  analysis,  we  have  not  supposed  the  existence  of  a  concrete

realization  for  the  mathematical  representation  of  the  magnitudes,  but  rather  we  have

began  from  the  supposition  of  this  representation  corresponds  with  a  mathematical  n-

object  and  this  supposes  an  essential  difference.  The  action  and  the  moment  that  we

present do not have necessarily to be a scalar  and  a  vector,  but  rather, in  general  they

will be a (n-1)-cotensor and a mathematical n-object respectively.

Therefore,  we  will  call  to  S  tensorial  action  and  P  tensorial  moment.  To  the

scalar  and  vectorial  magnitudes  that  traditionally  represent  to  the  action  and  the

moment, we will represent them with a line underlined to differentiate them.

Lorentz scalars and action principle.

We  are  interested  in  knowing  that  mathematical  expression  should  verify  the

tensorial action for check the principle of causality.

As  we  have  already  seen,  the  direct  application  of  the  principle  of  causality  is

translated in the expression:

S

∫=

P

Ù

This form of express the tensorial action assures us that S verifies the properties

of the tensors [5], or in the scalar case, the properties of a Lorentz scalar. As we know, it

is  said  that  a  scalar  is  a  scalar  of  Lorentz  when  it  doesn't  depend  of  the  coordinated

frame in which is expressed.

The  scalar  product  of  the  tensor  action  for  itself  is  a  scalar  of  Lorentz  too,

because in a change of coordinated from X to X ':

On  the  other  hand,  if 

( Xf

)

  is  a  scalar  function  of  Lorentz,  then  any

transformation in the coordinateses maintains unaffected the expression. That is to say

Xf
(

=

Xf
(

. Therefore, if 

( Xf

)

 is a scalar function of Lorentz then, a variation

in this function is equal to zero. Mathematically:

Applying this property to S 2 , we obtain the expression:

Sδ
(

2 =
)

0

(3)

This expression is the relationship that should complete the tensorial action to be

the  mathematical  representation  of  the  evolution  of  a  physical  system.  For  similarity

with the case of the scalar action, to the equation (3) we will call it principle of tensorial

action, principle of extreme tensorial action or principle of least tensorial action.

It  is  easy  to  find  the  scalar  equivalent  expression  equation  (3).  Since  it  is  a  to

2S , we can define the scalar 

S

+=

2S

. According to this, the property 

Sδ
(

0

 is

equivalent to 

Sδ

 that you  can develop from a scalar form until the expression:

Since  both  S   and  S   are  defined  except  in  a  constant,  the  condition 

arbitrary. That is to say: In all physical systems should be verify the condition 

0=S

  is

0=Sδ

.

As this is the condition of the action principle of Hamilton [6], this justifies us that we

call to  S  scalar function action and to  S  tensorial function action or simply action.

It is trivial to observe that, when the mathematical realization of P is vectorial,

then the traditional action coincides with S. For this reason, the principle of Hamilton is

a particularization of the equation (3).

In  consequence:  all physical  systems  comes  determined by  a  tensorial function

S,  to  which  we  will  call  action,  that  verify  the  principle  of  action  expressed  by:

Sδ
(

2 =

0

. As particularization we can say that all physical systems has defined a scalar

function S that it verify the condition of minimal action:

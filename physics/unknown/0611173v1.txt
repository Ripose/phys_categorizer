Abstract

The  consistency  of  the  results  of  measuring  the  gravitational  force  temperature  depend-

ence obtained by Shaw and Davy in 1923 and by the author in 2003 was shown. Such depend-

ence is observed in the laboratory experiments, it does not contradict the known facts of classi-

cal mechanics and agrees with astrophysics data. It was pointed out that experimental research

into temperature influence on gravitation was needed and perspectives of developing that trend

in gravitation physics was promising.

The  problem  of  influence  of  temperature  of  bodies  on  their  gravitational  interaction  was

naturally raised at the very early period of development of gravitation physics. The first attempts

to  experimentally  determine  the  relation  between  temperature  and  gravitation  did  not  produce

any results due to low accuracy of measurements [1]. Late in the XIX-th century, following the

development of electromagnetic theories of gravitation predicting an increase in body gravitation

force with an increase in their temperature the interest to relevant experiments rose. By 1916 the

most accurate measurements of dependence of gravitational force

degree-1 [ 2 ].  In 1923 Shaw and Davy pointed out the fallibility of that

result and on the basis of measurements carried out with higher  accuracy  they  concluded  “that

the  effect,  if  it  exists,  is  less  than   

per  degree,  and  may  well  be  zero”  [  3  ].  Actually,

The  abscissa  corresponds  to  the  difference  in  the  forces  of  gravity  created  by  heated  and  cold

massive bodies.

Nevertheless, the authors  did not insist  on the  accuracy  of  the  nonzero  result  which  they

obtained and regarded it as approximately equal to the measurement error magnitude; the actual

measurement error of the average magnitude α, according to the data of [3], is less than 40%.

Such a conservative estimate probably was caused by the fact that in the early 20ties the general

theory of relativity (GTR) began to become rather popular, according to which the temperature

effect on gravitation in experiment was practically not observed [4]. The impact of GTR was so

great that over next 80 years any experimental research into temperature dependence of the force

of gravity  was  not  carried  out  due  to  its  “nonscientific  nature”.  Incidentally,  the  basic  in  GTR

principle  of  equivalence  was  experimentally  checked  only  with  strict  stabilization  of  tempera-

tures of interacting bodies; the direct experimental evidences justifying that principle under dif-

ferent temperatures of test bodies are not available till the present time. 

In 2003 our work [5] was published which experimentally confirmed physical dependence

of body weight on its temperature. The physical prerequisite  of  temperature dependence of the

force of gravity, according to the phenomenological model, is the dependence of acceleration of

the force of gravity on the magnitude and sign of accelerations caused by influence of external

elastic forces on the test body [6]. With increase of body temperature the accelerated movement

ence of the force-of-gravity  acceleration on absolute temperature T of the body [5,7]. An exam-

ple  of  experimental  dependence  of  apparent  mass  of  brass  rod  on  duration  of  its  heating  (and

temperature) is shown in Fig. 2.

degree-1. Obviously, the signs of temperature change of gravitational force in

experiments [3] and [5] coincide, and the magnitudes of corresponding temperature coefficients,

with account for measurement errors, are close to each other. That’s why both Shaw and Davy’s

4

of  1923  and  our  experiments  of  2003  give  evidence  of  the  laboratory-observed  physical  tem-

perature dependence of the force of gravity: decrease of attractive force of bodies with increase

in their temperature. 

It is interesting to consider some astrophysical consequences of the above dependence. 

Slow change of the planet average temperature due to either the radiant heat exchange on

its surface or to internal heat processes within its volume changes, according to (2), the effective

magnitude of gravity constant. As a result, the planet orbit precesses with angular deflection of

perihelion for one planet revolution equal to

P  – period of planet turnover,  e  – orbit eccentricity (taken as e <<1),  t  – time [7].  For exam-

ple, in slow cooling of the planet the force of its gravitational interaction with the sun increases

(we take constant the average temperature of the sun), coefficient  k  is positive and orbit preces-

sion is direct.

The next example is a double pulsar. Slow cooling of the stars involved in the system of

double pulsar determines the increase in the force of their gravitational interaction. As a result,

the period of turnover of twin stars is reduced and their orbit periastrons are deflected. Relative

change in period P of the double pulsar is equal to

While  analyzing  the  complicated  movements  of  near-to-the  sun  plasma  it  was  noticed

that in the sun vicinity  the  effective magnitude of  the  gravity  constant  is  less  than  its  standard

value. Taking into account the fact that the temperature of plasma near the sun is high, in the or-

der of

, the fact is directly explained by the dependence (2).

The measuring of gravitational constant. Divergencies of the experimental values of the

gravitational  constant  might  be  caused  by  inequality  of  the  absolute  temperatures  of  sample

masses used in various gravitational experiments [8].

If the temperature dependence of the force of gravity keeps in extreme processes of black

hole  formation  then  a  similar  singularity  appears  to  produce  some  doubts.  Formation  of  black

holes is hindered by the pressure forces on the part of collapsing substance which might exceed

those of gravitational compression. In so doing, the compression process slows down and might

transform itself into the phase of scattering (heat explosion) of the substance; on the whole, that

process might be both of monotone and oscillating in time nature.

So,  today  there  are  experimental  grounds  to  consider  real  the  marked  dependence  of

gravitational force on the absolute temperatures of interacting mass. Such dependence does not

contradict the known experimental facts of classical mechanics and naturally agrees with the data

of astrophysics [7]. Comprehensive research into the temperature dependence of the gravitational

forces in the wide range of temperatures (including low ones, as well) of the test bodies of vari-

ous  physical  composition  will  allow  in  the  perspective  to  establish  new  peculiarities  of  the

gravitational interaction of those bodies. Physics of gravitation might receive new development

similar to that which optics received in transition from heat to laser light sources.

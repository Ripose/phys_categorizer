Abstract:  
From  BOOMERanG  experiment  determinations  of  Cosmic  Microwave  Background  (CMB) 
power spectra, a relatively small quantity of cosmic dark matter is infered.  
The practical absence of dark matter effects in the CMB power spectra may be evidence that this 
radiation is not so old. This evidence is in correspondence with the perfect blackbody spectra of 
the CMB, although the enormous flow of cosmic rays must interact with this radiation and step 
by step in billions of years, its spectra should be deformed or eliminated.  
An alternative interpretation to BOOMERanG experiment determinations and the CMB origin is 
proposed. Considering discontinuous small changes of light speed in time, one possible relation 
between CMB and quantized redshift was found.  
This alternative is in correspondence with about 30 Myr cyclic phenomena observed at Earth, like 
in  tectonic,  Mass  Extinction,  crater  impact  rate,  and  also  with  space  global  distribution 
determinations  like  galaxy  average  luminosity  distribution  at  about  10  Mpc  and  galaxy  fractal 
distribution changes at 10 Mpc. They are considered as a result of more general dynamics. 
This behavior is interpreted as the Universe presenting two dynamical phases following one each 
other  as  consequence  of  eventual  changes  of  about  0.1  million  years  duration  that  take  place 
cyclically with intervals of  26- 30 million years in between. We call them "activation phases” 
and “inhibition phases”, respectively.  
The present approach indicates the existence of a subtle non-linear dynamics, which could also 
explain  the  galaxy  fractal  distribution.  Then,  the  Universe  large  scale  structure  could  be 
interpreted as one three-dimensional “Turing-Structure”, whose observational picture is deformed 
by the different light time-delay with distance.

Introduction 
Several centuries were needed to solve the planetary system dynamics, although five planets are 
naked eye observable. The present Observational Cosmology problems are much more difficult 
to solve. It is equivalent to establish the fundamental dynamics of the planetary system observing 
from  an  atomic  nucleus  space-time  scale,  including  the  different  physical  behavior  and 
phenomenology at different scales. 
 
From BOOMERanG experiment determination of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power 
spectra  follows  a  relatively  small  quantity  of  cosmic  dark  matter  [Mc  Gaugh,  S.  2000].  This 
interpretation  of  the  experiment  result  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  CMB  is  a  very  old 
radiation and must contain the information of the whole Universe dark matter. 
 
On the contrary, the practical absence of dark matter effects in the CMB may be evidence that 
such  radiation  is  not  so  old.  This  evidence  is  in  correspondence  with  the  perfect  blackbody 
spectrum  of  the  CMB,  although  the  enormous  flow  of  cosmic  rays  must  interact  with  this 

radiation and step by step in billions of years, it should be deformed or eliminated. Moreover, the 
global quantized redshift is centered in the CMB reference frame [Tifft, W.G. 1997], which could 
implicate the existence of some relation between the CMB origin and the steps in redshift. 
 
Thus, the origin of the CMB is still to be determined. 
Like CMB was originated in the past, it may be the consequence of some global change, which is 
out  of  the  laboratory  experience.  Such  a  global  change  may  be  related  with  the  fine  structure 
constant change [Murphy, M. T. 2000], which has been related with some decreasing of the speed 
of light “c” with time [Barrow, J. D. 2000].  
 
In  that  way,  it  is  possible  to  consider  a  “c”  decrease  discontinued  in  time  and  the  following 
alternative to the CMB origin: 
 
ALTERNATIVE 
The small decrements of “c” imply small increments in the Rydberg constant, producing a global 
quantized redshift contribution, and the accumulation in time of “c” decrements globally provoke 
transition phenomena in elementary particles:                                                                                                            
•  A threshold value of the accumulated difference between the particles proper energy and the 
corresponding proper energy to the new values of “c” is reached.  Thus, a gradual transition 
to new values of particles proper energy and a gradual global emission process take place. 
•  At  the  threshold,  the  traveling  photons  make  a  complex  percolation-like  phenomenon,  they 
internally reorganize and emit part of their energy by one or two equivalent energy emissions 
near  to  300  Ghz  quanta  energy  in  a  way  that  the  spectra  are  redshifted  and  the  traveling 
photons conserve their direction of movement.    

•  The corresponding energy lost of traveling photons implies another global quantized redshift 

increment contribution. 

•  Such generalized emission with the pass of time undergoes some transition or random process 
and becomes into the current CMB. This means that a general global emission takes place and 
the CMB is renewed, which explains its blackbody spectrum and the BOOMERanG result of 
dark matter absence.  

•  The  threshold  value  is  reached  at  least  one  time  every  30  Myr  and  the  aforementioned 

•  Therefore, the observed spectra display a redshift similar to that of relative motion, but it is 

sequence of processes is repeated 

different, because it is quantized. 

 
At this point, I propose the following 
 
EXPLORATION 
The proposed Alternative must implicate: 
1.  A  numerical  relation  between  CMB  and  some  of  the  determined  global  quantized  redshift 

values. 

2.  Effects on space global distributions  
3.  Effects on Earth phenomena  
4.  Emission-absorption process in matter

1.   CMB – Global Quantized Redshift Numerical Relation 
Numerical Coincidences: 
The  successive  decrements  of  “c”  imply  successive  increments  of  the  Rydberg  constant 
(Rλ), which imply a minor value of Rλ at a time when the traveling photon was emitted than the 
laboratory  measured  value  of  Rλ  and  small  steps  in  redshift  take  place.  It  may  explain  small 
redshift quantum values of 37.5 km/s or less [Guthrie, B.N. 1996] [Tifft, W. G. 1997a]. 
 
However, if at some threshold value δc/c of the accumulated change in “c”, the traveling photons 
make emissions, which later become into CMB. To obtain the δc/c for traveling photon holds:       
Before the emission    E1 = mc1
After the emission 
 
The emission frequency is 
The “c” change is  
 
Using the relations (1) and (2)  
 
If we consider   
We have 
 
 
When  a  decrement  of    “c”  takes  place  and  the  threshold  value  is  reached  and  traveling  photon 
makes  one  or  two  emissions,  the  emission  frequency  must  approximately  correspond  with  the 
CMB central frequency of about 282.2 Ghz (from T=2.728 K) [Fixen, D. J. 1997]. Thus traveling 
photon makes one or two emissions of 282.2 Ghz quanta equivalent energy. Then it follows: 
 
A.  The traveling photon make one emissions of 282.2 Ghz quanta equivalent energy:  
In what follows we will obtain an approximation of the  δc/c threshold value. 
The traveling photon frequency decrease is δυ = −282.2 Ghz.  
The wavelength of λ0= 5000 Å is the redshift reference. 
From relation (3), using υ = c/λ  to λ0, the traveling photon relative change in frequency is  

δυ = υ−υ1   where δυ< 0 
δc = c−c1      where  δc< 0 

        and 
 
2 δc/c = δυ/υ   

2 δc/(c−δc) = δυ/(υ−δυ) 

υ> > −δυ 
 

c>> −δc 
 
 

2 δc/c1 = δυ/υ1 

(1) 

(3) 

(2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

δυ/υ0 = − 4.706 × 10−4  

 

 

 

Thus, for an emission of 282.2 Ghz, corresponds a “c” accumulation change of  
δc/c = − 2.353 × 10−4   

  

 

 

 

Then, this is the threshold value approximation at which the proposed emission takes place, that 
later becomes into CMB. From this threshold value and the current value of c= 299 792.5 km/s 
the accumulated decrease in “c” is δc = −70.55 km/s 
 
On other side using the redshift  
To  determine  the  contribution  to  global  redshift  due  by  the  Rλ  changes,  which  provoke  the 
λ measure changes from the value λ1 to λ0 is  

 z = λ−λο /λο   

 

 
 
 
As λ is linear dependent of Rλ  
Thus, when the threshold value is reached the Rλ accumulate change is 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

∆z1 = z0-z1 
∆z1 = (λ0−λ1)/λ0 
∆z1 = δRλ / Rλ  

(4) 

(5) 

(6) 
(7) 

Then, the global redshift contribution through the measure of λ with current laboratory values is:       

δRλ / Rλ= δc/c = 2.353  10−4   

∆z1 = 2.353 × 10−4 

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

(8) 

∆z2 = − δc/c/(1− 2 δc/c) 

∆z2 = (c/υ0 − c1/υ1)/(c/υ0)  
c1 = c − δc and δc < 0   
υ1 =  υ0 − δυ and δυ < 0 
∆z2 = 1− (1− δc/c)/(1−δυ/υ0)   

This is equivalent to a radial velocity of Vr1 = 70.55 km/s.  
 
On other side to obtain the contribution to global redshift by the traveling photon emission when 
the threshold value is reached:  
 
Considering  the  last  change  when  the  speed  of  light  has  been  decreased  from  c1  to  c,  as  a 
consequence  a  traveling  photon  makes  a  transition  from  the  value λ1 to  λ0  by  an  emission  of  a 
282.2 Ghz quanta equivalent energy and a second contribution to redshift take place: 
 
Using (6) and υ= c/λ   
Where   
 
 
 
And 
 
  
Then 
 
This  is  a  relation  between  the  relative  accumulated  decrements  of  “c”  at  the  threshold,  the 
traveling photon relative emission δυ of a 282.2 Ghz quanta equivalent energy to υ0 and the step 
contribution to global redshift “∆z” as a consequence of the emission. 
 
Using (3) 
 
This  is  a  relation  between  the  relative  accumulated  decrements  of  “c”  at  the  threshold  and  the 
step contribution to global redshift “∆z” as a consequence of the emission. 
 
And using (3)   
 
This  is  a  relation  between  the  traveling  photon  relative  emission  δυ of  a  282.2  Ghz  quanta 
equivalent energy  to υ0, and the step contribution to global redshift “∆z” as a consequence of the 
emission.  
 
Using  the  value  of  δυ/υ0 =  − 4.706  ×  10−4 in  relation  (10)  the  second  contribution  to  global 
 
redshift is  
This is equivalent to a radial velocity of about Vr2 = 70.5 km/s 
 
Then  at  both  global  redshift  contributions  numerical  coincidence  is  found  because  they 
approximate  to  the  global  redshift  quantum  value  of  about  72.1  km/s  in  the  CMB  rest  frame  
[Tifft W. G. 1997] and to 71.5 km/s in Virgo Cluster [Guthrie, B.N. 1997] to the spiral galaxies. 
But,  these  global  redshift  quantum  value  are  greater  than  70.5  km/s  and  70.55  km/s  former 
obtained,  it  may  be  interpreted  that  the  original  photon  emitted  frequency  (energy)  several 
million years ago were greater than the current CMB central frequency. 
 
B.  The traveling photon makes two emissions of 282.2 Ghz quanta equivalent energy. 
The traveling photon frequency decrease is  

∆z2 =  −(δυ/υ0)/2(1− δυ/υ0) 

∆z2 = 2.352 × 10−4  

(10) 

(9) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

δυ/υ0 = − 9.412 × 10−4 
This corresponds to the relative “c” accumulated decrease of  
δc/c = − 4.706 × 10−4   
It is an approximation to another possible threshold value at which the emissions take place, that 
later becomes into CMB.  
Thus, the “c” accumulated decrease is                

(12)  

(11) 

 

 

δc = − 141.1 km/s 

 

 

(13) 

 
When the threshold is reached the Rλ accumulated change is  
δ Rλ / Rλ = 4.706 × 10−4 
Thus, the global redshift contribution through Rλ changes by the measure of λ with the Rλ current 
laboratory value is  

(14) 

 

∆z1 = 4.706 × 10−4 
This corresponds to a radial velocity of Vr1 = 141.1 km/s.  
 
On other side, to obtain the global redshift contribution when the threshold value is reached and 
traveling  photon  makes  a  transition  from  the  value  λ1 to  λ0  by  the  emission  of  two  282.2  Ghz 
quanta equivalent energy, it is using the relation (10) and the redshift contribution is: 

 

 

 

∆z2 = 4.704  × 10−4 

This is equivalent to a radial velocity of about Vr2 = 141 km/s. 
 
Then,  at  both  global  redshift  contributions  a  numerical  coincidence  is  obtained,  because  this  is 
approximately twice the aforementioned spiral galaxy global redshift quantum values. 
 
As result, we have the following scenario (fig. 1):  
•  Due to accumulation of successive “c” changes, at one of the two possible threshold values of 
δc/c  =  −  2.353  ×  10−4    or    δc/c  =  −  4.706  ×  10−4,  which  respectively  correspond  with  the 
previously accumulated Rλ increments of δ Rλ/ Rλ = 2. 353 × 10-4 or δ Rλ/ Rλ = 4.706 × 10-4, 
it follows two possible first contributions to global redshift, which are equivalent to a radial 
velocity of: 
Vr1 = 70.55 km/s  or  Vr1 = 141.1 km/s.  

•  When global generalized emission of about 282.2 Ghz quanta equivalent energy at one of the 
two possible threshold values takes place, a second contribution to redshift takes place. The 
corresponding two possibilities of global redshift are equivalent to a radial velocity of: 
Vr2 = 70.5 km/s or Vr2 = 141 km/s 

 
In sum, the corresponding global redshift contributions are equivalent to radial velocities of: 
Vr = Vr1+ Vr2 = (70.55+70.5) km/s = 141.5 km/s, by the first threshold value or 
Vr = Vr1+ Vr2 = (141.1+141) km/s = 282.1 km/s, by the second threshold value. 
This implies that part of Hubble parameter does not mean an expansion. 
 
 
 
 

2. Space Global Distributions  
When one of the proposed threshold values is reached a major change in physical environ begins 
including the stars, the interstellar medium and galaxy activity. This may change the luminosity 
of stars, galaxies and the galaxy distribution parameters.  
 
The  existence  of  some  cyclical  global  change  every  30  Myr  might  have  had  some  effects  at 
different  times.  Observing  from  the  Earth,  the  parameter  distributions  with  distance  may  show 
concentrically  spherical  layers  of  about  8-10  Mpc  of  width,  separated  by  thick  layers  of  about 
0.03  Mpc  of  width,  in  which  transition  phenomena  took  place.  Some  of  the  possible  related 
Extragalactic Astronomy research results are the following: 
•  Using redshift as distance indicator, it was determined that the distribution of the galaxies in 
the  Universe  shows  a  fractal  structure.  Moreover,  two  different  fractal  structure  parameter 
values were determined, one in a scale bigger and the other smaller than 10 Mpc scale [Zhen, 
W. 1988].  

•  Later,  Using  the  Southern  Sky  Redshift  Survey  2,  was  found  both  luminosity  and 
morphological segregation at a high level of significance. Specifically, it was determined that 
the average luminosity and the fluctuation in luminosity of pairs of galaxies are enhanced out 
to separations near10 Mpc [Beisbart, C. 2000]  

 
These determinations are in agreement with the alternative of cyclical global phenomena about 
every 30 Myr [del Pozo, E. 1999a; --- 2000]. 
 
3. Earth Phenomena 
Small global quantized redshift of 18.3 km/s and 5.76 km/s have been determined [Tiff, W. G. 
1997a].  This  corresponds  to  relative  changes  δc/c  of  about  4  and  12  times  smaller  than  the 
threshold value (5) that is not enough to trigger the percolation-like phenomena proposed in the 
alternative.  Nevertheless,  such  changes  or  other  smaller  may  perturb  the  Earth  climate  and  the 
biochemistry  of  the  living  bodies  in  the  time  scale  of  several  million  years,  which  can  not  be 
explained by Earth orbital parameters changes.  
 
One  possible  related  evidence  is  the  CO2  paleoclimate  change  15  Myr,  9  Myr  and  3  Myr  ago 
[Pearson,  P.N.  2000],  at  6  Myr  intervals  between  them,  which  can  not  be  explained  by  Earth 
orbital parameter changes. The major change corresponds with the last Mass Extinction 15 Myr 
ago, when a threshold value with particle emissions might have occurred, while the minor 9 Myr 
and 3 Myr changes might correspond to small changes in physical constants without reaching a 
threshold value. 
 
Moreover, analyzing the shape of the radio jet in NGC6251 it was obtained that the axis of the jet 
shows a distinct wiggle of more than two cycles of 85 kpc, and a corresponding period of 6 Myr 
for an assumed speed of c/20 for the jet. This effect is considered due to interaction with external 
media [Saunders, R. 1981]. 
 
When  the  threshold  value  is  reached,  a  major  change  in  physical  environ  begins  including  the 
Earth  interior,  the  atmosphere,  the  seas,  and  the  biochemistry  of  the  living  bodies.  A  group  of 
processes with cycles of about 30 million years shows the mentioned characteristics:  
•  The terrestrial craters  [Yabushita, S. 1996] 

•  The terrestrial cycles of the tectonic and volcanic activities [Jain, V. E. 1984]  
•  The Mass Extinction of species in the whole Earth [Raup, D. M. 1984] (fig. 2)  
•  The big impacts on the Earth take place when one of the Mass Extinction is in process  
      [Archibald, J. D. 1997][Matsumoto, M. 1996]. 
   
A good candidate to explain the origin of such behavior is a cyclical generalized internal heating 
during several thousands of years [del Pozo, E. 1999; --- 2000a].  
 
This process at the Earth can be explained by the cyclical internal heating of Earth, which takes 
origin  to  the  volcanic  and  tectonic  cycles.  Due  to  internal  heating,  comets  and  meteoroids 
increase  their  internal  pressure  and  eventually  make  gas  jet  emissions  perturbing  their  orbits, 
which cause, that some of them go to the inner Solar System. Therefore, the impact occurrence is 
increased  and  provokes  eventually  big  impacts  at  times  when  one  of  the  Mass  Extinction  is  in 
process. The emitted material of the jets contribute to more material,  which also may increase 
the impact rate 
 
The triggering of that behavior takes place when one of the aforementioned threshold values is 
reached and all the matter makes a global transition by the gradual emission of:  
δE/E  = − 4.706  ×  10−4  or  δE/E= − 9.412  ×  10−4  during  several  thousands  of  years.  Then  some 
isotopes  must  lose  stability,  increase  the  number  of  nuclear  emissions  and  the quantity of  light 
elements, which could explain the present abundance of them in the Universe. 
 
Then, the protons (nucleons) in the matter must make the transition to a lower value of “c” and 
emit  X-rays  of  about  18.35  and  36.7  KeV,  which  could  explain  the  general  heating,  tectonic 
process  and  Mass  Extinction,  including  the  increase  of  genetic  variability  process  due  to  the 
increase of environmental radiation. Besides the “G” decreases may also play a role in the orbit 
perturbations  and  in  the  Mass  Extinction  scenario  by  the  triggering  of  tectonic  and  volcanic 
activity. 
 
The  value  intervals  of  the  physical  constants  in  which  life  is  possible  have  been  analyzed 
[Barrow, J. D. 1999]. Nevertheless, is possible to consider smaller intervals to different species 
and  family  species.  It  could  explain  why  species  that  survived  to  several  Mass  Extinction 
processes  reach  a  time  at  which  can  not  survive  any  more  in  the  new  physical  environmental 
conditions. 
 
4. Some Emission-Absorption Process Observed in Matter  
Two X-ray absorption lines in Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) were reported in 1988 [Murakami, T.]. 
The reported lines are at 19.3 KeV and 38.6 KeV, with a respectively full width at half maximum 
of 4.1± 2.2 KeV and 14.4 ± 4.6 KeV.  
 
To explain the absorption lines the authors propose a magnetic field of 1012 gauss and expressed: 
“The  question  remains  as  why  such  a  narrow  absorption  feature  appears  in  the  gamma-ray 
spectrum emitted by a high – temperature plasma”. 
 
Later, a detailed analysis indicates that observed lines are the result of radiation interaction with 
matter [Ghisellini, G. 2001]. 

 
Thus, following the proposed alternative is possible to consider the hypothesis that: Under some 
conditions,  protons  must  change  their  proper  energy  level  in  an  amount  near  of  the  proposed 
threshold values, showing emission-absorption lines. 
 
These  absorption  lines  values  in  relation  to  proton  proper  energy  (E=78  MeV)  correspond  to  a 
relative change of: 
•  One 19.3 KeV transition equivalent to  δE/E = − 2.47 × 10-4   
•  Two 19.3 KeV transitions equivalent to  δE/E = − 4.94  × 10-4 
•  One 38.6 KeV transition equivalent to  δE/E = − 4.94  × 10-4    
•  Two 38.6 KeV transitions equivalent to  δE/E = − 9.89 × 10-4 
 
Then  the  former  considered  values  of  X-ray  emission  by  protons  at  the  two  possible  threshold 
values have a numerical coincidence with the last three transition energy values of the absorption 
lines. 
 
Following the current alternative, the origin of the lines may be interpreted as a possible proton 
absorption-emission process. If this interpretation is confirmed, then this property of matter is in 
correspondence  with  the  “c”  threshold  values  proposed  to  the  CMB  origin,  due  to  the  quanta 
emission by traveling photon. 
 
As  
The corresponding two possible threshold values are: 
δc/c= − 2.47 × 10-4 
They  may  consider  as  another  approximations  to  the  proposed  threshold  values.  Observe  that, 
they do not depend of the reference λ0 as in the former approximation. 
 
Using  the  relation  (3)  to  calculate  the  corresponding  5000  Å  traveling  photon  of  one  or  two 
quanta equivalent energy emissions an equivalent energy emission of a 296 Ghz quanta energy is 
obtained,  which  is  also  a  numerical  coincidence  with  the  current  CMB  central  frequency.  But, 
these  frequency  are  greater  than  the  current  282.2  Ghz  CMB  central  frequency,  it  may  be 
interpreted that the original photon emitted frequency (energy) some thousand million years ago 
were greater than the current CMB central frequency. 
 
Moreover,  the  corresponding  global  quantized  redshift  contributions  in  traveling  photon  by  the 
emission of δΕ/E = 2 δc/c and using relation (9) are: 
From δE/E = − 4.94 × 10-4  ∆z2 = 2.46 × 10-4  
From δE/E  = − 9.89 × 10-4   ∆z2 = 4.93 × 10-4  
 
Therefore, they also have numerical coincidences with the global quantized redshift values [Tifft 
W. G. 1997] [Guthrie, B.N. 1997]. 
 
 

Vr2 = 74.0 km/s and  
Vr2 = 148.0 km/s 

δc/c= − 4.94  × 1 0-4 

δE/E = 2 δc/c  

and  

 

 

Further Consideration 
Then, is possible to consider:  
1.  The critical phenomena and global emissions have been occurred cyclically and correspond 
with  the  cycles  of  about  30  Myr  at  the  Earth,  or  8-10  Mpc  in  distance,  which  is  in 
correspondence with the variability increase of observed H0 parameter in the nearest galaxy 
clusters 

2.  The  accumulation  of  “c”  changes  followed  by  the  particle  emission  at  the  threshold  value, 

which renewed the CMB, takes place at least one time every 27-33 Myr.  

3.  The  global  redshift  contributions  every  30  Myr,  may  correspond  to  a  radial  velocities  of 

about Vr= 141.5 km/s or Vr= 282.1 km/s. 

4.  Thus, a non-expansive part of H0 parameter is explained. This is between: 

•  14 and 15.7 km s-1Mpc-1 to the first threshold value, or  
•  28 and 31.5 km s-1Mpc-1 to the second threshold value. 

5.  Then it remains a value between 62.3 and 64 km s-1Mpc-1 or 46.5 and 50 km s-1Mpc-1 to H0 
current determinations of 78 km s-1Mpc-1. If it is interpreted like an expansion [Arp, H. C. 
1998] the Universe is greater and older, which could explain the contradictions with the age 
of older cosmic objects. 

 
Moreover, as part of redshift must discontinued increase with distance due to the small changes 
in “c”, analyzing the redshift difference behavior between galaxies from the past to the present 
(from  a  far  to  nearest  spiral  galaxies),  a  pattern-like  behavior  might  experimentally  determine. 
Such  pattern  might  approximately  repeat  in  redshift  difference  sequence  (fig.1).  If  the  current 
alternative is correct and the pattern is found, it follows the determination of: 
•  The successive smallest contribution to quantized redshift, the “c” smallest decrement value, 

and the time interval between successive changes 

•  The  sequence  of  several  small  redshift  differences  of  about  37.5  km/s  or  18.3  km/s  or  less 
followed  by  a  step  of  about  70.5  km/s  or  about  141  km/s  corresponding  to  the  300  Ghz 
equivalent energy quanta emission, plus one of the former small redshift difference 

•  The  pattern  rule,  the  “c”  threshold  value  to  emission  and  the  original  emitted  quanta 

equivalent energy. 

 
Physical Constants:  
The  measured  alpha  variations  from  fine  structure  spectra  of  Quasi  Stellar  Objects  (QSO) 
[Murphy,  M.  T.  2000]  may  indicate  the  existence  of  different  arrangement  sets  of  physical 
constant values. 
From  the  proposed  light  speed  variations  and  the  measured  alpha  variation  follows  that  other 
physical constants like the electromagnetic constants may also change. 
 
By other  side,  may be  consider  “G”  decreases, which  must be interpreted as  changes  in  space-
time, which may provoke the “c” changes in a way that the space-time is observed flat, because 
the  space-time  has  the  property  of  conserve  its  curvature.  Then,  the  gravitational  constant  “G” 
may  change  discontinued  in  time  in  a  cycle  of  30  Myr  or  more  triggering  the  “c”  change 
sequence. And the “G” cycle may have some correspondence with the active galaxy duty cycle of 
about 100 Myr [Leahy, J. P.; 2002] [Combes, F.; 2000] 
 
 

Moreover, the active galaxy behavior may be explained as follows: Some time after a change in 
the value of “G” takes place, some galaxies nucleus may become active because:  

•  This  change  may  perturbs  the  black  hole  stability  and  the  gravitational  link  of  many 
bodies provoking the free motions of them in the galaxy and increase the material falling 
in black holes, which is in agreement with the AGN type-I x-ray observations 

•  The free material also contribute to new star formation and some time later can provoke 
the increase of the star formation rate in the galaxy, which is in agreement with the AGN 
type-II infrared observations. 

 

A greater value of “G” in the past is in correspondence with: 
•  A thin atmosphere and liquid water on Mars in the past 

A  star  must  exist  in  the  early  Universe  with  less  material  and  today  the  observed  compact 
MACHOS may be explained like the result of early star evolution ends, which results in small 
size massive objects. 

 
Conclusions 
The changes in the gravitational constant and the speed of light must be the result of some kind of 
global  space-time  reorganization,  in  which  some  other  physical  constants  may  change  their 
values.  At  some  threshold  value  of  the  difference  between  the  old  and  new  “c”  values,  the 
particles must also self-reorganize internally to the new conditions and make some emissions and 
the  traveling  photon  emission  process  may  interpreted  as  a  consequence  of  an  acceleration 
process  due  by  the  decrease  of  light  speed.  These  cyclical  changes  are  equivalent  to  cyclical 
perturbations in nature and provoke a sequence of process, whose results are present in the galaxy 
distribution structure and at the Earth history. 
 
This  exploration  indicates  that  in  the  Universe  a  subtle  non-lineal  dynamics  has  been  always 
acting. Then, the Universe shows two different dynamical phases: 
•  An activation one, in which at some threshold value percolation-like phenomena occur due to 
the  former  accumulation  of  small  variation  in  the  physical  constants:  A  general  global 
emission  takes  place  and  the  CMB  is  renewed  and  others  gradually  transition  processes 
follow during about 0.1 Myr, that are outside of our time of experimentation 

•  An  inhibition  one,  with  eventually  discontinued  in  time  minor  variations  in  some  physical 
constants,  which  contribute  to  the  fine  structure  of  global  quantized  redshift  without 
percolation-like phenomena, like in the present that lasts about 30 Myr 

 

This  non-linear  behavior  may  be  considered  like  a  “two-phase  dynamics”.  Thus  as  Turing 
Structures present in snail pictures, this approach helps to understand why the Universe has large 
matter  accumulations  in  “Walls”  structures  and  “Vacuums”  in  other  places  (fig.  3).  Then,  the 
Universe  large-scale  structure  may  be  considered  approximately  like  a  “Turing  Structure”  in 
three dimensions, whose observational picture is deformed by the different light time-delay with 
distance.

Abstract 

We    investigate  the  quantized  magnetic  flux  through  the  electronic  orbits  of 

Dirac  hydrogen  atom  in  the  absence  of  an  external  magnetic  field.  The 

sources  of  the    magnetic  fields  are  taken  to  be  that  of  proton's  magnetic 

moment  µp    and  electron's  magnetic  moment  µe    (or  µj    )  which  has  two 

components namely the orbital part µl and the spinning part µs .We show that 

the quantized magnetic fluxes through the electronic orbits corresponding  to 

the 

forms:

1.  Introduction 

2 

Magnetic flux quantization was first recognized by London [1] and Onsager [2] who argued 

that in the interior of the superconductor the current density vanishes and the requirement that 

the  electron  wave  function  be  single  valued  results  the  enclosed  flux  through  a 

superconducting  ring  is  quantized  in  units  of e

h .  Deaver  and  Fairbank  [3]  observed 

experimentally quantized values of magnetic flux through a superconducting ring. Onsager, L. 

and Lifshitz, I. M. used the Bohr-Sommerfeld phase integral method to show that the orbit of 

the electron in a uniform magnetic field is quantized in such a way that [4] the flux through it 

is

  (n  =  0,1,2,3,...)  where 

0Φ = e

argued  that  there  will  be  a  spin  contribution  to  the  magnetic  flux

  which  is  

based  on  the  magnetic  top  model  [6-8]  .  As  was  argued  in  [5]  the  quantized  magnetic  flux  

can  be  obtained  through  the  conversion  of  the  area  integral  of  the  magnetic  field  to  a  time 

integral  over  the  cyclotron  period  Tc    (=

).  Therefore  for  calculating  the  quantized

magnetic flux the important time interval was the cyclotron period of the magnetic field.  The 

aim of the present study is to calculate the quantized magnetic fluxes through the electronic 

orbits of Dirac hydrogen atom in the absence of an external magnetic field. The sources of the  

magnetic fields are taken to be that of proton's magnetic moment µp  and electron's magnetic 

moment µe  (or µj   ) which has two components, namely the orbital part µl and the spinning 

part  µs  .We  show  that  the  quantized  magnetic  fluxes  through  the  electronic  orbits 

corresponding 

to 

the 

(n,l=n-1,mj) 

eigenstates 

take

  where

0Φ = e

h   is  the  flux  quanta.  Further  we 

ask the requirement that between which states the flux change (∆Φ) is equal to (0, ± Φ0 ) .The 

answer  is  that  for  those  states  that  satisfy  :  (∆mj  =  0,  ±  1).  We  notice  that  this  condition  is

exactly  the same spin dependent selection rules as obtained recently by Saglam et. al. [9] for 

optical transitions in Dirac hydrogen atom using the well-known Golden rule [10] .  We show 

that both results allow spin flip which is not possible according to the conventional selection 

rules. As a simple example we look at the 1s → 2p optical transitions and again showed that 

some transitions allow spin flip which is not possible according to the conventional selection 

rules . The present result  can serve a significant help for understanding the recent observation 

of  the  spin  relaxation  in  excitonic  transitions  in  nanostructures  [11-13].  The  outline  of  the 

present  study  is  as  follows:  In  section  2    we  give  a  brief  summary  of  the  Schrödinger 

hydrogen atom. Section 3 deals with the Dirac-Hydrogen atom. In section 4 we calculate the 

quantized magnetic fluxes through the electronic orbits of the hydrogen atom. In Section 5 we 

apply the present result to 1s → 2p optical transitions. Section 6 contains the conclusions. 

2. The Schrödinger Hydrogen Atom 

In  the  hydrogen  atom  the  potantial  energy  V(r)=- r

e2 is  one  of  the  simplest  potantial  in 

quantum  mechanics  that  can  be  solved  analytically.  Although  the  problem  is  a  two  body 

problem  the  related  wave  equation  becomes  one  particle  equation  after  the  center  of  mass 

motion is separated out. Because of the fact that  proton is more massive than electron, we can 

also  assume  that  the  proton  is  at  rest  at  the  origin  of  the  center  of  mass  system.  In    this 

approximation the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation for electron reads [14-16]:

where the first term in square bracket is the kinetic energy operator and the second term is the 

potantial energy of the electron in the rest mass frame of the proton. In spherical coordinates 

the potantial energy in Eq.(1) produces the following results:

Here  the  1's  and  0's  stand,  respectively,  for  2×2  unit  and  zero  matrices  and  the  σσσσ  is  the 

standard vector composed of the three Pauli matrices σσσσ = (σσσσx ,σσσσy , σσσσz ). Since the Hamiltonian 

(is  invariant  under  rotations,  we  look  for  simultaneous  eigenfunctions  of  HD,    |J|2,  and  Jz,

 4. Magnetic Flux Quantization Argument 

As was stated earlier for calculating the quantized magnetic flux [5], the area integral of the 

magnetic  field  must  be  converted  to  a  time  integral  over  the  cyclotron  period  Tc  

(=

π
2 =
ω
c

π
2

). Therefore the important time interval is cyclotron period of the magnetic field :

which  will  be  the  starting  point  for  calculating  a  quantized  magnetic  flux  through  any 

quantum  orbit.  In  the  following  we  calculate  the  quantized  magnetic  fluxes  through  the 

electron's orbits which  are determined by the solutions of the Dirac  equation. The source of 

the    magnetic  field  will  be    that  of  proton's  magnetic  moment µp.  .  The  probability  density 

P(r)  ≈  r2  |  Rnl(r)|2      has  its  maxima  at  rn=n2a0    and  in  the  semiclassical  picture  electron  is 

assumed to be moving in circular orbits with radius rn=n2a0  around proton which is at rest at 

the origin of its rest frame . The flux coming from proton's magnetic moment µp is found to 

depend on the quantum numbers , n  and l  only :  Φnl =( n  - l )Φ0 . We add to this the fluxes 

coming  from  the  induced  effects  of  the  orbital  and  spin  angular  momenta,  namely  we 

calculate the similar fluxes due to the orbital and spin magnetic moments (µl and µs= µe ) of 

the  electron  .The  last  two  fluxes  are  found  to  depend  on  the  quantum  numbers  ml      and  ms 

respectively.  So  for  (l  =  n-1)  the  resultant  quantum  flux  corresponding    to  the  quantum

numbers:[n,l,mj]  is  found  to  be:

.  The 

selection rule [9]  for an optical transition (n,l,mj> → n',l',mj

' >    ; ∆mj = 0, ± 1)  results that  

in an optical transition  the flux change  must be : ∆Φ= 0, ± Φ0 .   

a) Calculation of 

nlΦ : 

Since  the  Coulomb  potantial  requires  planar  orbits  for  electron,  we  assume  that  proton's 

magnetic  moment µp  is  in  the  z-direction  and  the  electron  is  rotating  in  (x-y)  plane.  If  the 

proton's radius is rp ,then  outside the proton  the vector potential is:

(r ≥ rp)  

(14) 

(cid:2)
where  r

(cid:2)
is  the  vector  going  from  origin  to  the  point  where  A

  is  being  computed.  The 

(cid:2)
magnetic field  B

 is calculated through the relation: 

In the x-y plane the x and y components of 

 vanish and the z component takes the form

(r ≥ rp)  

(16) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where 

r

. 

First we want to calculate the fluxes through the x-y plane outside and inside the proton: The 

related fluxes will be defined as follows: 

Φout(rp)= The total flux through x-y plane outside the proton (r ≥ rp) 

Φin(rp)=  The total flux through x-y plane inside the proton (r ≤ rp) 

 

8 

The  condition  of  no  magnetic  monopoles  (

(cid:2)(cid:2)
. =∇ B

)0

  requires  the  number  of  magnetic  field 

lines  inside  the  proton  must  be  equal  to  the  number  of  magnetic  field  lines  outside  the  the 

proton . Therefore 

Φin(rp) = -Φout(rp). 

 

 

(17) 

Φout(rp) can be calculated easily from Eq.(16):

Secondly  we  define  Φ(rn)  which  is  the  flux  through  the  electron  orbit  with  radius  rn=n2a0. 

Since we assume that electron is rotating in x-y plane, Φ(rn) will be :

The result that we found in Eq.(21) is the flux that correspond to one circling period, T .But 

we  know  that  [5]  ,  for  calculating  the  quantized  magnetic  flux  ,the  area  integral  of  the

magnetic  field  must  be  converted  to  a  time  integral  over  the  cyclotron  period  Tc  

(=

2 =

ω

π
eB

). Therefore to find the quantized magnetic flux corresponding to the period Tc we 

must multiply the flux Φ(rn) in Eq.(21) by  T

Tc  which requires the calculations of T and Tc (or 

ω and ωc ) in terms of rn=n2a0. We  know that in the hydrogen atom  the Coulomb force (e2/r2) 

causes electron to rotate around proton.In addition to this we will have the centrifugal force 

coming  from the last term of the Eq.(5). So the net force will be  ( 

 - 

 ) which

results  in  a  zero  tork  with  respect  to  the  origin.  Therefore  the  total  angular  momentum  is  a 

constant of motion: In the semiclassical picture first we set :

2(cid:1) =

2(cid:1)l

2

 and  we denote 

the  inertial  moment  of  the  electron  with  respect  to  the  origin  by  I=mr2  .Then  the  angular 

momentum  coming  from  the  first  term  is    L1=Iω1  with  (ω1=

  )  and  the  angular 

momentum coming from the second term is L2= (cid:1) l=Iω2 ≡Iωl with (ω2≡ ωl =

). Therefore 

the net angular velocity ω in terms of  rn  =n2a0  is : ω=ω1-ω2

On the other hand the magnetic field, B(rn) of the proton at the position of the electron defines 

another period which is the cyclotron period,

If  we  calculate  Tc  and  T  for  n=1  we  can  see  that  Tc≈106T.  Therefore  during  the  cyclotron 

period  Tc  electron  rotates

calculating the quantized magnetic flux, the important time interval is cyclotron period ,Tc of 

the  magnetic  field  .Therefore  we  must  multiply  the  flux  Φ(rn)  in  Eq.(21)  by  T

Tc .  So  from 

Eqs.(21),(22) and (23) , the flux per cyclotron period (the quantum flux) is

 Eq.(24)  is  the  flux  corresponding  to  the  quantum  number    (n  and  l)  .  In  the  following  we 

calculate the magnetic fluxes coming from the other quantum numbers mj, hence  ml  and ms.

  will  be  maximum  for   rn=n2a0    with  sinθ  =1  in  x-y  plane.  Therefore  in  the 

semiclassical picture the electron will execute a circular motion about z-axis. This is born out 

by  the  fact  that  due  to  the  radial  wave  function  and  the θ-dependent  part  of  the  spherical 

harmonic  being  real-valued  the  probability  current  density  arising  from  an  energy

Here the negative sign shows that the electric current flows in an opposite direction to that of

Our  next  objective  is  to  establish  a  quantized  magnetic  flux  coming  from  the  current  of  the  

orbiting  electron  (including  spin).  The  idea  is  based  on  the  familiar  notion  that  an  electric 

current  flowing  round  a  circle  of  radius  a  about  the  z-axis  would  enclose  a  magnetic  flux 

generated by the current. This flux should be proportional to the current, the proportionality 

constant being the self-inductance [23,26]. So, a current element in Eq. (30) circulating about 

 

12 

the  z-axis  in  a  circle  of  radius  a  should  enclose  an  induced  magnetic  flux  element

 The  resulting    total  quantized  magnetic  flux  through  the  electron  orbits  corresponding  to

For a dipole transition  the spin dependent selection rules were obtained recently by Saglam 

et. al. [9] for Dirac hydrogen atom using the well-known Golden rule [10] : 

                                                         ∆mj = 0, ± 1                                                                (40) 

Substitution of Eq.(40)  in Eq.(39)  gives the selection rules for the magnetic flux  in a dipole  

transition: 

                                               

=∆Φ

.                                                                   (41)

So in the  dipole transitions (including optical transitions ) the change in the total angular 

momentum is associated with a similar change in the quantum flux. In the following section 

we will apply the present result to the 1s-2p transition of the hydrogen atom. 

 

 

 

14 

5. Aplication to the 1s-2p transition: 

  Since we assume that proton's magnetic moment vector µµµµp is in the z-direction, then in the 

ground  state  electron    will  occupy  the    1s  (spin  up)  ≡  |  1,0,0  ,↑  >    state.  From  Eq.(36),  the 

quantized flux  corresponding to the ground state will be: 

                                                        Φ(1,0,0,1/2)=(1/2)Φ0      .                                                                 (42) 

 We will have 6 different spin dependent  2p states which are: | 2,1,0 ,↑↓> ; |2,1,1 ,↑↓> and      

| 2,1,-1,↑↓ >.  The  corresponding quantized fluxes for these states will be: 

    

     

   

 

 

 

Φ(2,1,0,1/2)=(1/2)Φ0 

Φ(2,1,0,-1/2)=(3/2)Φ0 

Φ(2,1,1,-1/2)=(1/2)Φ0 

Φ(2,1,-1,1/2)=(3/2)Φ0 

Φ(2,1,-1,-1/2)=(5/2)Φ0   . 

Φ(2,1,1,1/2)= -(1/2)Φ0                                                                 (43) 

Acccording to the selection rule given by Eq.(41) the possible transitions will be as follows: 

↑,0,0,1

 

→ 

↑,0,1,2

 ....(allowed,  ∆Φ z=0 ) 

↑,0,0,1

 

→ 

↓,0,1,2

....(allowed,  ∆Φ z=Φ0) 

↑,0,0,1

 

→ 

↓,1,1,2

....(allowed,  ∆Φ z=0 ) 

 

       (44) 

↑,0,0,1

 

→ 

↑− ,1,1,2

....(allowed,  ∆Φ z=Φ0) 

 

 

15 

But the following transitions are not allowed, because, the excited state can not  have higher  

than the ground state flux [5]  and  the flux change can not be higher than Φ0 . 

↑,0,0,1

  Χ→   

↑,1,1,2

....(not allowed,  ∆Φ z= -Φ0  ) 

             

↑,0,0,1

 

  Χ→   

↓− ,1,1,2

....(not allowed,  ∆Φ z=-2Φ0)        

 (45)   

As it is seen from Eq.(44)  some transitions permit spin flip which is in agreement with our 

earlier result [9]  where the related matrix elements were: 

< 2,1,0 ,↑  |  -d.E   |1,0,0 ,↑ > =

C 

< 2,1,0 , ↓ |  -d.E   |1,0,0 ,↑ > =

< 2,1,-1 , ↑ |  -d.E   |1,0,0 ,↑ >= -

C 

 

 

 

  (46) 

 
In the last two lines we have zero matrix elements which means no transitions at all. 

6. Conclusions 

We  have  calculated  the  quantized  magnetic  fluxes  through  the  electronic  orbits  of  Dirac 

hydrogen  atom  in  the  absence  of  an  external  magnetic  field.  The  sources  of  the    magnetic 

field are taken to be that of proton's magnetic moment µp  and electron's magnetic moment µe  

(or µj   ) which has two components namely the orbital part µl and the spinning part µs .We 

show  that  the  quantized  magnetic  fluxes  through  the  electronic  orbits  corresponding  to  the 

(n,l,mj)  eigenstates  can  be  expressed  in  tems  of  the  related  quantum  numbers,  namely;

apply the present result to the dipole transitions of hydrogen atom and show that the selection

rule      (∆mj  =  0,  ±1)    that  were  obtained  recently  by  Saglam  et.  al.  [9]  can  be  replaced  by

.  So  the  change  in  the  total  angular  momentum  is  associated  with  a  similar 

change in the quantum flux as well. Since during an optical transition a photon is absorbed or 

emitted  then  the  above  selection  rule  imply  that  photon  should  carry  a  quantized  magnetic 

flux  of    Φ0  with  itself.  It  is  believed  that  the  present  result  will  bring  a  new  insight  to 

understant  the  polarization  spectroscopy  of  hiydrogen-like  atoms  such  as  Cs  [28].  The 

application of the present result to the selection rules for the optical transitions of hydrogen 

atom  gives  access  to  the  spin  flip-floppings.  Therefore  it  is  also  believed  to  serve  a 

significant  help  for  understanding  of  the  recent  observations  of  spin  relaxation  in  excitonic 

transitions (such as 1s→2p or 2p→3d ) in nanostructures [11-13].

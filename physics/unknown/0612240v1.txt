Abstract. Fast switching (< 10 nsec) measurement results on the recently developed BST(M) (barium 
strontium  titanium  oxide  composition  with  magnesium-based  additions)  ferroelectric  materials  are 
presented. These materials can be used as the basis for new advanced technology components suitable 
for  high-gradient  accelerators.  A  ferroelectric  ceramic  has  an  electric  field-dependent  dielectric 
permittivity  that  can  be  altered  by  applying  a  bias  voltage.    Ferroelectric  materials  offer  significant 
benefits for linear collider applications, in particular, for switching and control elements where a very 
short response time of <10 nsec is required. The measurement results presented here show that the new 
BST(M) ceramic exhibits a high tunability factor: a bias field of 40-50 kV/cm reduces the permittivity 
by a factor of 1.3-1.5.  The recently developed technology  of gold biasing contact deposition on large 
diameter  (110  cm)  thin  wall  ferroelectric rings  allowed  ~few  nsec  switching  times  in  witness  sample 
experiments. The ferroelectric rings can be used at high pulsed power (tens of megawatts) for X-band 
components  as  well  as  at  high  average  power  in  the  range  of  a  few  kilowatts  for  the  L-band  phase-
shifter,  under  development  for  optimization  of  the  ILC  rf  coupling.    Accelerator applications  include 
fast  active  X-band  and  Ka-band  high-power  ferroelectric  switches,  high-power  X-band  and  L-band 
phase shifters, and tunable dielectric-loaded accelerating structures.   
 

INTRODUCTION 
A  ferroelectric  ceramic  is  a  material  with  an  electric-field-dependent  dielectric 
permittivity  that  can  be  altered  very  rapidly  by  an  applied  bias  voltage  pulse.  Typical 
representative ferroelectric materials are (Ba,Sr)TiO3 or a BaTiO3 - SrTiO3 solid solution 
(BST). The BST material can  be synthesized  in polycrystalline, ceramic  layer, and  bulk 
forms  [1-3].  Ferroelectrics  have  unique  intrinsic  properties  that  make  them  extremely 
attractive  for  high-energy  accelerator  applications.  The  response  time  is  ~10-11  sec  for 
crystalline and ~10-10 sec for ceramic compounds [1]. Unlike semiconductors and plasma 
devices,  ferroelectrics  allow  control  of  their  dielectric  properties  in  two  directions 
(varying the dielectric parameters and restoring the initial phase) using a single external 
control pulse, offering unique capabilities for high-power switching device design. High 
dielectric  breakdown  strength,  low  gas  permeability  and  simplicity  of  mechanical 
treatment  make  ferroelectric  ceramics  promising  candidates  for  the  loading  material  in 
accelerator tuning and switching devices [4-6]. 

Fast switching low-loss ferroelectric materials [7-8] offer significant advantages for rf 
adjustment and tuning in both advanced and more conventional accelerators, in particular 
for  applications  involving  switching  and  high  power  control  [9-12].  Ferroelectric-based 
devices  that  have  been  recently  proposed  include:  (1)  ultra-fast  electrically-controlled 

phase shifters for amplitude and phase control of superconducting and room temperature 
accelerators including ILC and ERLs [9]; (2) high-power switches for pulse compression 
systems of stand-alone sources for high–gradient tests of future CLIC-like linear colliders 
[10,11];  (3) tunable dielectric loaded accelerating (DLA) structures [13-14].  

One  application  of  this  technology  is  relevant  to  the  International  Linear  Collider 
(ILC) project [9]. Based on SC accelerating structures, the ILC will accelerate beams of 
electrons and positrons to 0.5 TeV. The collider will require thousands of SC RF cavities.  
In the current ILC design about twenty accelerating structures are fed  from a single  RF 
source.  This plan for RF power distribution requires special devices to be developed that 
provide  individual  phase  tuning  and  matching  for  each  accelerating  structure.    The 
present  ILC  project  design  calls  for  these  devices  to  be  mechanical  three-stab  tuners. 
However,  by  employing  ferroelectric  ceramics  with  low  losses  [6,8]  electrically-
controlled  tuners  with  switching  times  of  ~few  microseconds  [7,8]  can  be  designed.  
Such  a  tuner  allows  adjustment  of  the  coupling  of  the  accelerating  structure  over 
timescales much smaller than the duration of the RF pulse. In turn this capability allows 
reduction of cryogenic losses at the structure and eventually significant reductions of the 
entire energy consumption and operating cost of the proposed collider scheme [9].  This 
type of fast tuner can also be employed in many other SC and conventional accelerators 
for amplitude and phase control optimization [9-12], for example in ERL systems.  

This new ferroelectric composition has direct applications to development of tunable 
dielectric loaded accelerating (DLA) structures [13]. Frequency tuning (or phase velocity 
adjustment)  will  allow  the  elimination  of  any  frequency  shift  caused  by  machining 
tolerances  of  the  dielectric  dimensions,  thermal  expansion  of  the  structure, or  dielectric 
constant  heterogeneity  [13-14].  The  method  used  to  vary  the  frequency  of  a  DLA 
structure consists of incorporating a thin layer of a ferroelectric material backing a layer 
of  conventional  ceramic.  A  DC  bias  voltage  is  used  to  vary  the  permittivity  of  the 
ferroelectric layer and thus tune the overall frequency of the DLA structure [13-14]. 

The  properties  and  parameters  achieved  for  some  of  these  low-loss  BST-based 
ferroelectric ceramics were published previously  [4-6,8].   In this paper we present new 
results  on  the  development  of  BST(M)  ferroelectric  material.  Special  attention  will  be 
paid  to  the  improvements  in  the  time  response  of  the  material.    The  technology  of 
metallization of the ferroelectric ceramic that is critical to achieve time responses of  < 10 
nsec is discussed. The experimental techniques used for the time response measurements 
are also presented.  

This  newly  developed  ferroelectric  technology  has  been  experimentally  validated  at 
the  Argonne  Wakefield  Accelerator  in  a  tunable  DLA  structure  experiment  [14]  and  is 
under  further  development  at  Omega-P  Inc./Yale  University  for  the  demonstration  of 
high  power  microwave  switches  and  fast  ferroelectric  phase-shifters  at  both  L-band  for 
ILC and at Ka-band for high accelerating gradient research  [6,8,9-12].  

 

FAST SWITCHING AND LOW LOSS BST FERROELECTRIC 
DEVELOPMENT 

for  accelerator  component  development. 
Ferroelectric  properties  required 
Ferroelectrics have an E-field-dependent dielectric permittivity ε that can be very rapidly 
altered  by  application  of  a  bias  voltage  pulse.  The  switching  time  in  most  instances  is 

limited by the response time of the external circuits that generate and transmit the high-
voltage  pulse,  and  can  therefore  be  in  the  nanosecond  range.  Ferroelectric  materials 
should  have  the  following  properties  in  order  to  be  used  in  high-power  rf  switches  for 
linear  collider  applications  and  tunable  DLA  structures  [6,8]:  (1) the  dielectric  constant 
should not exceed 300-500 to avoid problems in the switch design caused by interference 
from  high-order  modes  and  extra  wall  losses;  (2)  the  dielectric  constant  should  be 
variable  by  15-20%  to  provide  the  required  switching  and  tuning  properties;  (3)  bias 
electric fields required to adjust the permittivity within this range should be no larger than 
a few 10’s of kV/cm; (4) the loss tangent should be in the range of 5×10-3
 or lower at 11 
GHz to allow switch operation at high average power in a collider having a repetition rate 
of  120-180  Hz.  DLA  structures  also  require  loss  factors  in  the  range  of  5×10-3  at  11.4 
GHz. 

Along  with  its  electrical  properties,  the  material  must  have  sufficient  mechanical 
strength to permit the manufacturing of complex and massive objects of relatively  large 
volumes  that  can  be  machined  to  high  mechanical  tolerances.  At  the  same  time,  the 
technology of the tunable material fabrication must provide extremely high homogeneity 
of the dielectric constant and other microwave parameters throughout the volume of the 
finished ferroelectric elements [8].  

Modern bulk  ferroelectrics, such as  barium  strontium titanate (BaxSr1-xTiO3, or BST 
with  additives, dielectric constant ~ 500), have rather high electric breakdown strengths 
(100-200  kV/cm)  and  do  not  require  too  large  a  bias  electric  field  (~20-50  kV/cm)  to 
effect  a  significant  variation    (20-30%)  of  the  dielectric  constant  ε   [3,4-6].  The  loss 
tangent  for  commercially-available  samples  of  these  materials  is  ~10-2
  at  10  GHz [2,3]. 
Euclid  Techlabs  LLC  has  recently  developed  and  tested  a  modified  bulk  ferroelectric 
based  on  a  composition  of  BST  ceramics  and  magnesium-based  additives.  The 
parameters  of  the  newly  synthesized  composition  satisfy  requirements  (1)-(3)  listed 
above [6,8]. 
X-band Low Loss Ferroelectric Development 

We recently developed and tested a bulk ferroelectric composed of BST ceramics and 
magnesium oxides, that exhibits a permittivity ε = 500,  dielectric loss factor in the range 
of 5×10-3  and tunability factor of 1.20-1.30 with a 40-50 kV/cm bias field applied. [4-6, 
8]. 

Barium  strontium  titanate  solid  solutions  (BaxSr1-x)TiO3  (x  =  0.45  –  0.55)  were 
synthesized  by  ceramic  processing  from  titanium  dioxide  (TiO2)  and  strontium  and 
barium carbonates (SrCO3, BaCO3) or presynthesized  barium  and or strontium titanates 
(BaTiO3,  SrTiO3).  The  initial  materials  were  treated  mechanically  by  mixing  them  in  a 
vibration  mill  for  three  hours  to  a  particle  size  of  1  µm  before  sintering.  The  sintering 
temperatures of the ceramic samples were in the range of 1380-1540 °C.   

In the papers [4,6], two kinds of  ferroelectric  compositions  based on (BaxSr1-x)TiO3 
(BST) solid solutions with additive of Mg-based compounds (BST(M)-1 and BST(M)-2) 
have been presented. The ratio of barium and strontium components was in the range x = 
0.4-0.5  with  a  content  of  up  to  20%  wt.  of  magnesium-based  compounds.  Ceramic 
samples  developed  out  of  these  ferroelectric  compositions  demonstrated  the  dielectric 
constant in the range of ε = 400500.   Loss tangents of the samples at 3-11 GHz were 
found  in the range (4.1-6.8)×10-3 for BST(M)-1 and (2.1-4.2)×10-3  for BST(M)-2 [4-5]. 

The tunability factor (∆ε /ε) at low frequency (1 MHz) on samples made of ferroelectric 
ceramics was  measured to be 11% at 2.4 V/µm  for BST(M)-1 and 6% at 2.0 V/µm  for 
BST(M)-2.    Tunability  measurements  at  microwave  frequencies  (10  GHz)  of  the 
BST(M)-2 samples obtained a tunability factor of ~9.5% at 2.8 V/µm bias field [4-6].  On 
average  the  tunability  factor  is  in  the  1.15  –  1.20  range  at  50  kV/cm  for  this  type  of 
ferroelectric ceramic.   
Ferroelectric-Based Accelerator Component Fabrication 

Initial  samples  of  BST(M)-type  ceramic  materials  studied  in  this  work  are  powders 
with  particle  size  ~ 1 µm  based  on  solid  solutions  of  barium/strontium  titanates  with 
magnesia-based additives. The composition of these powders as well as their processing 
technology  provides  the  option  of  using  various  methods  of  forming  half-finished 
products  that  are  widely  used  in  ceramic  technology.  These  are  primarily  methods  of 
hydraulic and isostatic pressing used for ceramic preforms as cylinders (pipes) of various 
lengths and cross-sections.

The operating mode of the cavities is TE031.  

We  produced  the  basic  shapes  from  ceramic  powders  similar  in  composition  and 
processing  to  those  used  as  dielectric  waveguides  for  DLA  applications  [13-14].  This 
technology provides uniform hydraulic pressing at the horizontal plane of the ring. At the 
same time, to fabricate a  ferroelectric tube with diameter ~ 100-120 mm  made of small 
grain powders we used a combination of hydraulic and isostatic pressing. This combined 
technology  ensures  a  highly  homogeneous  compression  of  the  material  along  the  total 
ring length to provide uniform dielectric properties along the length of the element.  

A  specially  developed  technology  of  double  layer  magnetron  metal  deposition  has 
been  used  to  apply  the  gold  contacts  for  the  bias  voltage.  This  technology  allows 
deposition  of  a  1-2  µm  thick  gold  layer  on  a  sub-layer  at  the  ferroelectric  surface 
providing  an  adhesion  satisfying  the  mechanical  requirements  of  the  device.  The  same 

kind of metallization in turn enables the fast < 10 nsec switching of the ferroelectric. The 
electrical measurement results are presented in next section.  

 Fig. 1 shows one such large diameter ferroelectric ring (~110 mm) with the deposited 
gold  biasing  contacts.  Rings  108  mm  in  diameter,  20  mm  in  length  and  2.8  mm  in 
thickness have been fabricated for the active ferroelectric RF switch design presented in 
Fig.2.

The  basic  parameters  of  the  nonlinear  compositions  with  increased  tunability  and 
relatively low microwave loss factor based on the BST ferroelectric solid solutions have 
been presented in Refs. [1, 3, 4, 5]. Following Ref. [5],  it should be noted that the basic 
principle  of  the  development  this  kind  of  composition  is  the  forming  of  ferroelectric 
phases  with    Curie  temperatures  <  200°K.  The  tunability  factor  of  the  BST-based 
ferroelectric composition can be enhanced by increasing its barium titanate content. The 
corresponding  Curie  temperature  shift  to  a  higher  temperature  range  along  with  the 
increased tunability causes the dielectric constant and  microwave  loss  factor to increase 
as  well.  A  BST-based  composition  especially  optimized  for  the  high-power  accelerator 
applications has been synthesized. This material with an increased barium titanate content 
of  x>  0.5  exhibits  a  dielectric  constant  in  the  range  of  400-600  and  contains  Mg-based 
additives  (more  than  20%  wt.).  The  Mg  compounds  used  here  are  linear  ceramic 
dielectrics, but interact weakly with the main ferroelectric phase of BST ferroelectric and 
exhibit a relatively low dielectric constant by comparison with the main BST phase.  

In  next  section  are  presented  fast  switching  studies  of  the  samples  of  two  kinds  of 
ferroelectric  compositions  based  on  (BaxSr1-x)TiO3    solid  solutions  with  additives  of 
various  Mg-compounds  (BST(M)-3  and  BST(M)-4)  with  the  ratio  of  barium  and 
strontium  components  in  the  range  x  =  0.55-  0.60  but  with  the  addition  of  magnesium 
compounds  from  25%  up  to  50%  wt.      The  fast  switching  dielectric  response 
measurements  have  been  done  with  gold  metallized  witness  BST(M)-3  and  BST(M)-4 
samples with dimensions of 1.0×1.0×0.7 mm3 and  1.0×1.0×0.2 mm3 respectively.

measurement results on a nsec scale.  BST(M) 
sample with the gold biasing contact (and sub-
layer). Switching time is << 10 nsec.  

The block-diagram of experimental setup are shown in Fig.3. Fig.4 presents a picture 
of the test fixture.  A  microwave signal of  f~1.3GHz  is  fed through a  high  voltage  high 
pass filter (HV HPF) to the input port 1 of a 3dB- 90° directional coupler. Port 3 of the 
coupler is loaded by a series resonant circuit including the BST(M) capacitance under test 
(tunable end). Port 4 is open. The output microwave signal in port 2 is the sum of signals, 
reflected  from  the  ports  3  and  4.  Thus  output  signal  amplitude,  or  the  coupler 
transmission  coefficient  S21  depends  on  the  phase  shift  (∆ϕ)  of  the  microwave  signal 
reflected  from  the  tunable  end.  In  limiting  case  of  ∆ϕ=0  the  output  signal  falls  to  zero 
(|S21|=0) and at ∆ϕ=180° the output signal is maximal (|S21|=1.  

The  microwave  detector  is  sensitive  to the  envelope of  the  output  signal  amplitude. 
Under high voltage pulses from the biasing HV pulser the capacitance of the metallized 
ferroelectric is varied, resulting in a corresponding variation of the phase of the reference 
signal  reflected  from  port  3  that  in  turn  leads  to  variation  of  S21.  A  dual  channel 
oscilloscope  records  the  control  pulse  voltage  and  the  detected  reference  signal  S21.  A 
high  voltage band-pass  filter (HV BPF)  is  included  in the  circuit to protect the detector 
from  harmonics of the control  voltage  from the  high  voltage pulser. It is  found that  for 
the 3 kV biasing pulse effective suppression down to 0.5 mV was successfully provided 
by  the  HV  BPF.  To  evaluate  the  capacitance  of  the  ferroelectric  sample  under  test  the 
experimental setup was calibrated in terms of a normalized capacitance.  

Measurement results are presented in Figs. 5 and 6. Note that the test fixture provides 
no distortion in time scale down to 1 ns for bias pulses applied from the HV pulser to the 
ferroelectric sample. The shape of the control pulses presented in Fig. 5 (rise time ~4 ns, 
fall time ~1µs) is defined only by the parameters of the HV pulser.  Typical results for the 
ferroelectric samples are shown on a the µsec scale  in  Fig. 5  and expanded to the nsec 
time range in Fig. 6. One can see that the rf signal retraces the bias voltage curve shape 
demonstrating the short response time of the material. Analysis of the measurement data 
presented  in  Fig.  6  shows  that  the  BST(M)  ferroelectric  with  the  gold  bias  contacts 

provides  a  switching  time  considerably  less  than  10  nsec,  much  smaller  than  the 
switching time needed for our present applications.   

 

SUMMARY 
We  have  created  new  BST(M)  materials  intended  for  advanced  accelerator 
applications.  Our  work  involved  the  entire  production  chain:  synthesis  of  ceramic 
ferroelectric  samples;  study  of  their  microstructure;  shape  and  size  distributions; 
dielectric  response  measurements  in  the  10-35  GHz  frequency  range;  temperature 
dependence  of  the  ferroelectric  parameters;  and  electrical  properties--  permittivity,  loss 
tangent  and  tunability.    Loss  tangents  in  the  range  of  (3-4)×10-3  at  10  GHz  and 
tunabilities in the range of  25-35 % at 40 - 50 kV/cm biasing fields have been achieved.  
We  have  developed  large  diameter  (110  mm)  ring  samples  to  be  used  as  RF  switching 
elements for accelerator applications. A double-layer bias contact deposition process has 
been  developed.    We  have  demonstrated  switching  times  in  the  order  of  few  nsec  for 
BST(M) ferroelectric samples. All these efforts will lead to high power demonstrations of 
devices incorporating these new ferroelectric materials.

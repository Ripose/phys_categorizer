ABSTRACT 

Negative refraction is known to occur in materials that simultaneously possess a negative 

electric  permittivity  and  magnetic  permeability;  hence  they  are  termed  negative  index 

materials.  However, there are no known natural materials that exhibit a negative index of 

refraction. In large part, interest in these materials is due to speculation that they could be

used  as  perfect  lenses  with  superresolution.    We  propose  a  new  way  of  achieving 

negative  refraction  with  currently  available  technology,  based  on  transparent,  metallo-

dielectric  multilayer structures.  The advantage of these structures is that both tunability 

and transmission (well above 50%) can be achieved in the visible wavelength regime. We 

demonstrate  both  negative  refraction  and  superresolution  in  these  structures.    Our 

findings  point  to  a  simpler  way to  fabricate  a  material  that  exhibits  negative  refraction. 

This opens up an entirely new path not only for negative refraction, but also to expand 

the exploration of wave propagation effects in metals.

The  propagation  of  light  inside  metals  has  never  been  seriously  considered 

because  bulk  metals  are  highly  opaque  at  almost  all  wavelengths  across  the  entire 

electromagnetic spectrum. A quasi-transparent region naturally occurs near the so called 

plasma  frequency,  where  the  real  part  of  the  index  of  refraction  approaches  unity,  and 

absorption is minimized [1].  Understanding the propagation of light in metals has taken 

on  a  special  significance  since  the  prediction  that  an  object,  illuminated  with  TM-

polarized light, may form a super-resolved image of itself on the other side of the barrier 

[2].  The image is formed by negative refraction [3] that occurs inside the metal, which 

focuses a diverging wave-front (the beam) down to a very tight spot, thus exciting large 

spectral components (k-space), including evanescent modes.  The argument made is that 

the  presence  of  evanescent  modes  at  the  focus,  in  addition  to  the  propagating  modes, 

makes  it  possible  for  the  image  to  be  resolved  beyond  the  limits  imposed  by  ordinary 

optical materials and by diffraction [2].  

 

The basic mechanism described in reference [2] is based on a change in direction 

of  the  longitudinal  component  of  the  electric  field  inside  the  metal,  which  fosters  a 

change in direction of the Poynting vector.  In other words, the Poynting vector of a TM-

polarized  beam,  incident  at  an  angle  on  a  metal  surface,  or  layer,  refracts  evanescently 

with  a  negative  angle  inside  the  metal.  We  italicize  the  word  "refracts"  because  the 

Poynting vector S and the wave vector k are not co-directional. It is the continuity of the 

longitudinal  component  of  the  electric  displacement  field,  D=εE,  at  the  boundary  that 

forces  the  change  in  the  direction  of  propagation  of  the  Poynting  vector.    Then,  if  the 

metal  is  sufficiently  thick,  and  the  object  is  sufficiently  close,  the  rays  may  converge 

twice,  once  inside  the  metal  layer,  and  a  second  time  outside  it,  where  the  object  is 

3 

imaged  with  features  that  exceed  the  diffraction  limit,  i.e.  superresolution.  The  effect 

predicted in reference [2] has been experimentally observed and verified [4, 5].    

 

A  shortcoming  with  the  single-layer  super-lens  is  the  opacity  of  metals. 

Therefore,  theoretical  predictions  were  made,  and  experiments  carried  out,  using  silver 

layers approximately 40nm or less, above but near the plasma frequency, which occurs at 

~320nm,  where  the  dielectric  constant  of  silver  is  negative,  and  the  material  is  still 

somewhat  transparent.  The  modus  operandi  of  the  transmission  process  is  based  on  the 

excitation of surface modes, which evanescently couple the light to the other side of the 

barrier. In general, transmittance is rather low, typically not exceeding a few percent [4, 

5], but the transmission may be increased somewhat by placing sub-wavelength holes on 

the metal sheet [6].  The opacity of metals has thus driven researchers to seek negative 

refraction and  super-lensing in a  roundabout way, by first engineering a negative index 

material in the microwave regime using metallic rods and loops to induce an electric and 

magnetic resonance [7-9], and then by seeking a way to scale down the size of magnetic 

circuits using nano-wires or nano-strips, for example, in order to access the much coveted 

visible  region  [10].    However,  the  containment  of  material  and  scattering  losses,  along 

with the successful achievement of size reduction, remain formidable challenges. 

 

In  this  article  we  report  that  there  is  a  relatively  easy  way  to  obtain  negative 

refraction for TM-polarized light throughout the visible range, using so-called transparent 

metals  [11-14].    These  are  layered,  metallo-dielectric  stacks  that  may  contain  several 

metallic layers, where the thickness of each layer may be tens of nanometers, so that total 

metal  thickness  may  easily  reach  into  the  hundreds  of  nanometers.  Remarkably,  the 

structure  can  be  designed  so  that  it  remains  transparent  within  pre-selected,  broad 

4 

wavelength  ranges  in  the  visible  region  and  beyond.    The  location  of  the  transparency 

window usually depends on the thickness of the intervening dielectric material, and can 

be  engineered  rather  easily  by  using  a  combination  of  appropriate  metals,  and/or 

dielectric materials, from the visible well into the mid-infrared range. For instance, one 

may use almost any dielectric or semiconductor material, in combination with aluminum 

(for work in the ultraviolet range), silver (best used in the visible part of the spectrum), 

gold, and copper (both better suited for near-infrared applications). As an example, an 11-

layer, Ag/MgF2 stack  containing  150nm of silver was fabricated [12, 13]  using  thermal 

evaporation techniques, that featured a peak transmittance of about 52% at 532nm, with a 

full  width  at  half  maximum  well  in  excess  of  100nm.    Metal  layer  thicknesses  ranged 

from  a  low  of  25nm,  to  a  high  of  40nm,  and  so  it  is  possible  to  further  increase 

transmittance by thinning out Ag layers, and by choosing a material with a relatively high 

index of refraction, such as ZnO or TiO2 [14].  We note that an approach that considers 

infinitesimally  thin,  metallo-dielectric  multilayers  for  negative  refraction  has  been 

considered previously [15].  However, the approach is not an interferometric one, relies 

on evanescent wave coupling, does not achieve nearly the same transparencies, and so it 

fails in the regime we are considering because it assumes that each metal layer is so thin 

that  it  forms  a  nano-sheet,  and  the  stack  may  be  thought  of  as  an  effective  medium 

characterized by an average dielectric susceptibility and a mean-field.  

 

To present our results we use a pulse propagation model that integrates the vector 

Maxwell's  equations  in  the  time  domain  with  two  spatial  coordinates  and  time.    The 

model is  described in  detail  elsewhere, and it was derived for the general conditions of 

dispersive  and  discontinuous  dielectric  susceptibility  and  magnetic  permeability 

5 

[14,16,17].  Our typical scenario unfolds within a structure roughly 500nm thick, half of 

which  may  be  metal.    Assuming  a  TM-polarized  incident  field  with  the  magnetic  field 

polarized  in  the  x-direction,  using  the  model  we  may  calculate  any  electromagnetic 

quantity of interest.  For example, the Poynting vector takes the form:

Although for individual plane waves the direction of the Poynting vector coincides with 

the direction of the electromagnetic momentum density, for localized wave packets it is 

always more appropriate to talk about momentum. As defined in Eqs.(1-3), one generally 

finds that P and k are co-directional in ordinary, isotropic, low-absorption materials, and 

that in negative index materials they point in opposite directions [15], as expected [3].   

 

Eqs.(1-3) represent instantaneous quantities. Taken together they may be used to 

6 

calculate  the  refraction  angles  of  both  momentum  (or  energy)  and  phase  front.  As 

mentioned earlier, we use the word "refraction" with some caution, because it is usually 

intended to mean the direction of the wave vector k.  However, this parallelism ceases to 

hold  in  metals,  for  both  TE  and  TM  polarized  incident  waves.    The  consequences  are 

more  dramatic  in  the  case  of  TM  polarized  fields,  because  they  lead  to  anomalous 

refraction of the Poynting vector, as discussed in reference [2]. 

 

To illustrate the negative refraction process through a transparent metal stack, we 

examine the propagation of short pulses through a 6 and 1/2 period, Ag(25nm)/X(22nm) 

stack.    Here,  X  represents  a  generic,  high  index  material  that  we  use  to  show  how  the 

process works, and at the end we will provide a list of suitable materials.  We assume the 

index of refraction of material X is n=4.  The stack contains 150nm of silver metal, and it 

is approximately 282nm thick.  The first and last layers of the stack are X layers, each 

approximately  11nm  thick.    This  choice  is  useful  because  it  tends  to  smooth  and 

maximize the transmission function, and to minimize reflections [14].  In Fig.1 we depict 

the  plane-wave  transmittance  through  the  stack  as  a  function  of  wavelength,  for  TM-

polarized light incident at 45º.  We first tune the carrier wavelength of the incident pulse 

at 400nm, where the transmittance is ~43%.  The dielectric constant of Ag at 400nm is 

ε= −

3.77

 [1].  We note that we use actual material data because we find that it is 

important  to  do  so  if  one  is  to  seek  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  agreement  with 

experiments [12, 13]. For simplicity, but only for the moment, we assume that material X 

is dispersionless and absorptionless.  

 

We  assume  our  incident  pulse  is  Gaussian,  and  ~15  fs  in  duration,  with  carrier 

frequency  tuned  to  400nm.    Fig.(2)  contains  several  snapshots  that  chronicle  the 

7 

dynamics  of  the  pulse  as  it  traverses  the  stack.    The  centroid  of  the  transmitted  wave 

packet  appears  to  be  shifted  upward,  a  detour  that  is  best  perceived  for  short,  well-

localized  wave  packets,  but  that  clearly  holds  for  pulses  of  larger  spatial  extension  and 

longer  duration.  This  shift  can  only  be  understood  in  terms  of  additional  upward 

momentum supplied to the pulse by the structure.   

 

Fig.(3) summarizes the negative refraction process and our basic result. Although 

the  quantities  we  calculate  are  instantaneous,  one  may  proceed  by  either  performing  a 

time average as the pulse dwells inside the stack, or by simply taking the most dominant 

values,  which  occur  when  the  peak  of  the  pulse  arrives  at  the  structure.    The  total 

momentum refracts anomalously inside the transparent metal stack, forming an angle of 

approximately -25º with the normal.  Given a structure length of 282nm, the upward shift, 

denoted  by  δ  in  the  figure,  is  given  by  δ~131nm.    Furthermore,  calculations  similar  to 

those  exemplified  in  Fig.(2)  were  carried  out  for  incident  angles  of  30º  and  60º.    The 

resulting  momentum refraction angles were found to be ~ -17º and ~ -31º, respectively.  

Application of Snell's law immediately reveals that all these angles have in common an 

effective,  negative  refractive  index  of 

n −

~ 1.67

.  The  reality  is,  of  course,  somewhat 

more  complicated,  but  the  result  is  rendered  even  more  dramatic  by  the  fact  that  total 

momentum and total wave vector do not point in the same direction, and in fact in this 

case they point in altogether different quadrants.  Yet, Snell's law appears to still point the 

wave  in  the  right  direction.    Of  course,  one  cannot  ascribe  to  the  wave  vector  its  usual 

meaning and qualities, and a clear inequality between group and energy velocity quickly 

emerges, with the group velocity becoming an ill-defined concept.   

 

Although  this  result  may  seem  surprising,  the  fact  is  that  energy  and  group 

8 

velocities are the same only for homogenous media, away from any boundaries [18].  It 

has already been demonstrated that, in the absence of absorption, the two velocities are 

generally  different  near  surfaces  or  inside  strongly  scattering  one-dimensional  systems, 

such  as  photonic  band  gap  structures  of  finite  size  [19].  This  discrepancy  is  associated 

with  pulse  reshaping  and  scattering  losses  due  to  geometrical  dispersion,  i.e.  the 

introduction of longitudinal index discontinuities.  Nevertheless, the physical difference 

between group and energy velocity is generally not recognized even in structures of finite 

length, and in most of the literature the terms are inappropriately used interchangeably. 

Then, it should not be surprising to discover that in absorbing, two-dimensional systems 

such as ours energy and group velocities cease also to be collinear, and not quite so easily 

related.  A study of the Fourier spectrum of the pulse, similar  to  that done in reference 

[16], clearly shows that all spectral components develop in a way that <k> and P point in 

opposite quadrants. 

 

Now that we have established that negative refraction occurs in the visible range, 

we wish to test the structure's performance across the transparency window. We fix the 

incident  angle  at  45º,  tune  the  carrier  frequency  of  the  pulse  at  500nm,  and  find  a 

negative refraction angle of ~ -13º.  We then tune the pulse at 600nm, and find that the 

pulse still refracts negatively, but with an angle of approximately -1º. Although the basic 

cause  and  effect  for  the  pattern  that  emerges  is  quickly  identified,  namely  that  the 

magnitude  of  the  dielectric  constant  of  silver  eventually  overtakes  that  of  the  dielectric 

material  (ε=16)  at  longer  wavelengths,  more  is  at  play  here  than  just  a  simple  ratio  of 

dielectric  constants.    First,  let  us  recall  our  stated  need  for  a  high  index  material.    At 

400nm,  the  magnitude  of  the  ratio  between  the  real  parts  of  the  dielectric  constant  is 

9 

16/3.77.   At 500nm the ratio drops to 16/8.57, and by the time we reach 600nm the ratio 

is ~16/14.   The refraction process is generally anomalous (upper, right quadrant) in each 

metal layer, and normal (lower, right quadrant) in each dielectric layer. This aspect of the 

dynamics  is  exemplified  on  the  right  side  of  Fig.(3),  where  we  show  the  momentum 

vectors in each type of layer.  The higher index of refraction accomplishes at least two 

things inside the dielectric layers: it keeps the ray closer to the normal (smaller refraction 

angle), and it slows down the wave.  At the same time, and perhaps more importantly, the 

electric fields become localized inside the metal layers in almost equal measure compared 

to the dielectric layers [11-14].   

 

In bulk metals, the electric and magnetic fields are out of phase by approximately 

45º [17], as the electric field is expelled from the metal.  This phase mismatch translates 

into a spatial delocalization of the fields.  In sharp contrast, inside our transparent metal 

stack  this  spatial  delocalization  does  not  hold,  as  both  electric  and  magnetic  fields 

simultaneously  occupy  each  metal  layer.  In  fact,  the  magnetic  field  has  local  maxima 

inside the metal.  As a result, and in addition to pointing in the anomalous direction, the 

local Poynting vector (and resulting momentum), which is the product of the electric and 

magnetic fields, can be large inside the metal.  When this is combined with the fact that 

the  dielectric  momentum  makes  a  shallower  angle  with  the  normal,  then  the  metal-

momentum  dominates to yield a total momentum that points in the anomalous direction. 

These dynamics are completely determined by an interference phenomena that generally 

requires  relatively  thick  metal  layers,  unlike  the  approach  outlined  in  reference  [15], 

(thinner  layers  may  improve  transparency,  but  also  reduce  the  amount  of  anomalous, 

upward momentum), and takes advantage of field localization inside the metal layers in 

10 

such a way that cannot otherwise be accomplished in any single, metallic layer. 

 

Up  to  this  point  we  have  only  addressed  the  issue  of  the  existence  of  negative 

refraction.  However, we also wish to tackle the subject of super-lensing, and whether it 

is  possible  to  resolve  an  object  below  the  wavelength  limit.    We  begin  by  once  again 

considering a pulse tuned at 400nm, but this time it is incident on a metal shield with a 

small aperture. The metal shield is approximately 180nm thick, opaque by any measure, 

but we carve out a small slit approximately 0.25μm across.  The situation is exemplified 

in Fig.(4).  The slit is located approximately 50nm away from the stack, and the image 

plane  is  located  approximately  600nm  away  from  the  slit,  or  ~300  nm,  less  than  one 

wavelength,  away  from  the  stack.    The  field  transmitted  through  the  slit  is  sampled  at 

different  times,  as  it  propagates  through  the  transparent  metal  lens.  Fig.(5)  captures  a 

snapshot of the field, just as part of the wave packet forms a clear focus on the right side 

of  the  stack.    The  approximate  center  of  the  focus  is  intersected  by  the  imaging  plane 

(dotted  line).  We  thus  sample  the  field  along  the  dotted  line,  and  plot  the  resulting 

transverse field profile in Fig.(6).  The result is a typical diffraction pattern, but the slit's 

image  casts  a  bright,  discernable  spot,  with  full  width  at  half  maximum  (FWHM)  of 

approximately  0.16μm,  which  resolves 

the  slit  with  an 

incident  wavelength 

approximately  four  times  larger.  In  comparison,  in  Fig.(6)  we  also  show  the  transverse 

profile of a field diffracting from the same slit, located the same distance away from the 

screen.  The FWHM of the freely diffracting pulse is approximately ten times broader. 

 

The only issue that remains unresolved is the question of suitable materials.  We 

have  identified  several  candidates  that  are  suitable  in  the  visible range,  for  example  Si, 

GaP, and GaAs.  The indices of refraction of Si and GaAs are above 4, while that of GaP 

11 

is between 3 and 4. Although bulk Si and GaAs are opaque in the visible range, a number 

of thin layers may be combined with varying thicknesses of Ag to yield a transparency 

range.    For  instance,  we  find  that  6  and  1/2  periods  of  Ag(32nm)/Si(22nm)  yield  a 

transmittance  window  centered  around  500nm  (where  the  real  part  of  the  dielectric 

constant of Si is ~18), with maximum transmittance of ~20%.  At this wavelength, our 

model yields a negative refraction angle of ~ - 10º.   Even though GaP has a lower index 

of refraction than Si, one may obtain substantially similar results (refraction angle of ~ -

13º, and n ~ -2.3) by making the structure somewhat thicker.  Finally, at 632nm we find 

that the transmittance from a 6 and 1/2 period Cu(32nm)/Si(43nm) is still approximately 

30%, and yields a negative refraction angle of ~ -3º.   So, it is possible to find relatively 

common materials, and have negative refraction ad super-resolution occur in the visible 

range. 

 

In conclusion, we have presented theoretical evidence that negative refraction can 

occur  throughout  the  visible  range  in  transparent,  metallo-dielectric,  photonic  band  gap 

structures.  These structures may contain hundreds of nanometers of metal, and yet they 

can be transparent to visible light.   Our simulations suggest that incident TM-polarized 

waves undergo negative refraction, and that the stack may form a super-resolved image.  

These results open a new point of view, and may help pave the way to the achievement of 

practical  devices  and  applications  based  on  negative  refraction.  Since  transparent  metal 

structures  have  already  been  fabricated  in  the  visible  spectrum  using  a  number  of 

different  dielectric  materials,  the  experimental  realization  of  negative  refraction  in  such 

structures  presents  no  new  discernable  technical  challenges.    Taken  together  with  the 

tunable aspects of the process, which we have touched upon, the search for suitable, high-

12 

index  materials  may  yield  candidates  that  could  also  make  it  possible  to  increase  the 

object-lens  distance.  Furthermore,  by  searching  for  suitable  materials,  possibly  with 

negative dielectric constant, super-resolution can be expected at longer wavelengths, with 

significant applications to IR imaging.

Figure Captions 

Figure 1. 

Transmittance vs wavelength from a 6 and 1/2 period stack composed of 

Ag(25nm)/X(22nm),  inclusive  of  entry  and  exit  X  layers  11nm  thick.    The  angle  of 

incidence is 45º.  The transmission window extends over the entire visible range. 

Figure 2.      An  incident  Gaussian,  TM-polarized  wave  packet  is  incident  on  the 

transparent metal stack of Figure 1.  The pulse that exits to the right of the stack is shifted 

upward by approximately 131nm. 

Figure 3. 

Schematic representation of the refraction that occurs inside the stack (left 

drawing).   Although P and k point in different directions, the angle of refraction is still 

predicted  by  Snell's  law.    Right  drawing:  the  local  momenta  inside  two  adjacent  metal 

and dielectric layers are shown. 

Figure 4. 

A Gaussian wave packet is incident form the left on a metal shield with an 

aperture  F=0.25μm  across.      The  transparent  metal  stack  described  in  the  caption  of 

Figure  1  is  located  a  distance  b=50nm  away  from  the  slit.    An  image  plane  stands 

approximately L=0.6μm from the aperture.

Figure 5. 

Contour  diagram  of  a  snapshot  of  the  field  inside  and  to  the  right  of  the 

transparent metal stack.  The figure shows that a focal point is visible just to the right of 

the stack, about 300nm away from it.  The dotted line intersects the focus, and represents 

the position of an imaging plane. 

Figure 6. 

Image produced by the slit on the image plane indicated on Figure 5.  The 

full width at half maximum of the field that propagates through the stack (solid line) is 

approximately ten times narrower than the field emanating form the same aperture, and 

propagating in free space.

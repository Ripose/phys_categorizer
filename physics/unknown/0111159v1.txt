Abstract

A  Post  Mortem  System  was  developed  for  the
Relativistic  Heavy 
Ion  Collider  at  Brookhaven
National  Laboratory  (BNL)  to  provide  a  playback  of
the collider state at the time of a beam abort, quench,
or  other  failure  event.  Post  Mortem  data  is  used  to
provide  diagnostics  about  the  failure  and  to  improve
future stores. This data is read from hardware buffers
and  is  written  directly  to  the  main  file  system  by
Accelerator  Device  Objects 
front-end
computers.    The  Post  Mortem  System  has  facilitated
analysis  of  loss  monitor  and  power  supply  data,  such
as  beam  loss  during  magnet  quenches,  dump  kicker
misfires  and  power  supply  malfunctions.  System
details  and  recent  operating  experience  will  be
discussed.

1 INTRODUCTION

The  post  mortem  system  at  RHIC  (Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider) was designed to aid physicists and
engineers  in  determining  the  cause  for  beam  loss  or
other mechanisms that cause the accelerator to abort
the  beam  in  the  RHIC  machine.    One  of  the  major
reasons for the necessity of this system is the use of
superconducting  magnets  in  the  RHIC  accelerator.
Each magnet has a tolerance level of beam loss that it
can  accept.   Any  additional  beam  loss  above  the
threshold would likely cause a magnet to quench.  Not
only  is  this  disruptive  to  the  physics  program,  but
damage to the magnet could occur.

There  are  many  systems  that  are  responsible  for
maintaining  beam  operations.    These  include  'beam-
control'  systems,  such  as  power  supply  systems,  rf
systems,  vacuum  systems,  as  well  as  others.    Other
systems 
in  place  perform  measurements  and
diagnostics,  such  as  beam  position  monitor  and  wall
current  monitor  systems  for  beam  tuning.    The  beam
loss  monitoring  system  provides  beam 
tuning
diagnostics, 
environmental
protection.

Any  system  involved  in  maintaining  beam  in  the
accelerator  and  diagnosing  why  beam  has  been  lost
from  the  accelerator  may  find  its  place  in  the  post
mortem system.

2 SYSTEM COMPONENTS

2.1 Data Acquisition

The  design  of  the  data  acquisition  system  (Fig.  1)
and its capability to buffer data lies at the heart of this
system.  The ability to continuously collect and buffer
data, then freeze the buffers due to an external event is
what  makes  the  playback  of  the  accelerator  state
possible.  Response times to events and the ability to
time-correlate  the  data  to  an  event  are  all  critical  in
making  this  system  work.   The  hardware  used  to
accomplish this task are specially designed MADCs[1]
(multiplexed  analog  to  digital  converter  system)  and
WFGs (waveform generators).

The  MADCs and  WFGs  can  be  configured  to  take
some  action  upon  receiving  an  external  event  or
trigger.    For  post  mortem  systems,  the  action  is  to
immediately  stop  collecting  data  or  to  collect  an
additional second or more of data prior to freezing the
buffer.

FECs  (front-end  computers)  contain  software
objects called  ADOs[2]  (accelerator  device  objects)
that  abstract  the  concept  of  control  devices.    In  the
case  of  post  mortem,  after  a  trigger  is  received,  the
FEC delivers to the MADC ADO a signal indicating it
is time to read the data from the hardware buffers and
write  the  data  to  disk.   A  task  in  the  FEC  is  also
signalled to write the WFG ADO data.
2.2 Data Storage

the 

called 

application 

The ADOs write data to the file system in the form
of  SDDS[3]  files  which  are  placed  in  a  generic
directory.  These are immediately post-processed by a
console-level 
post
MortemServer to make them ready for final use and to
free  the  generic  directory  for  subsequent  reuse.
Performing  these  functions  in  a  server  provides
flexibility  since  it  is  much  less  disruptive  to  modify
console-level  software  than  front-end  software.    The
functions  performed  by 
the  postMortemServer
include:
•  Entry  of  a  database  header  to  indicate  that  the
event  was  recognized,  and  that  processing  of  its
data is underway.

•  Similar  data  (by  system,  by  timestamp,  etc.)  are

stored together.

•  Management of dataflow, and coordination of

•  The SDDS files are converted from ascii format
to binary to save disk space, since FEC software
does not support binary format.

•  Spawning processes to save additional device data
into archive files, beyond the buffered array data
written by ADOs.

•  Final  revision  of  the  database  header  description
to  indicate  the  current  and  final  status  of  event
preparation,  and  to  indicate  that  the  archives  are
available for inspection.

2.3 User Interface

A user interface was designed to view post mortem
data.  The viewer allows a user to select a system, find
the  event  of  interest,  and  then  display  the  data  about
the system.  Event of interest selection is assisted by
filters,  such  as  run  name  selection  (RHIC  data  is
stored  within  runs  –  e.g.  rhic_au_fy01)  and  time
limiting  options  (e.g.  day,  week,  month,  entire  run).
The  process  reads  from  the  stored  data  files,  places
the  data  into  generic  post  mortem  data  objects,  and
then  displays  the  data  in  graphic  form  to  the  user.
Basic systems can then have their data displayed with
little additional programming.

Reading  of  data  is  handled  generically  for  most
systems.    For  systems  that  have  single  data  sets  for
objects  no  additional  work  is  required  (e.g.  the  loss
monitor system has one data set per monitor).  More
complex  systems  that  have  natural  abstractions,  such
as the power supply system, require additional effort.
A power supply will have many data sets that represent
its  various  properties  (current,  reference  current,
voltage, etc.).  This abstraction requires an object that
comprises many data sets.  Utilizing this technique has

proved  to  be  very  valuable  in  maintaining  core  code
that allows for system expansion with relative ease.

on, 

operations 

system-specific 

The  user  interface  has  provisions  for  systems  to
provide 
and
specialized  displays  of,  the  data.    For  example,  loss
monitor  data  sets  can  be  searched  for  areas  of  high
loss to be presented to the user, rather than displaying
all  of  the  post  mortem  data  and  requiring  visual
inspection  by  the  user.    The  loss  monitor  data  also
makes use of a 3-D display that provides a user with an
overall  view  of  beam  loss  just  prior  to  and  after  an
event occurs.
2.4 Post-processing

One  system  was  developed  that  makes  use  of  the
the  Loss  Analysis  Server
data  automatically, 
(LAServer).    Each  time  beam  is  removed  from  the
collider,  an  investigation  is  conducted  into  the
locations in which beam may have been lost.  This is
accomplished  by  saving  the  loss  monitor  and  current
transformer  post  mortem  data  after  an  event.   The
LAServer makes use of the generic post mortem data
objects to read the data.  It then performs an analysis
of the data to reach conclusions about where the beam
has been removed from the machine (a beam dump is
the desired location for beam to be placed when it is
removed from the machine).

3 POST MORTEM IN ACTION

3.1 Performance

The  post  mortem  system  has  had  its  share  of
growing pains.  In its infancy, some data were stale or
missing, timestamps were incorrect, files were lost or
stranded  (not moved to long-term data storage areas),
and  servers  were  unable  to  perform  their  tasks.    The

 

present system has become quite reliable.  There are
still  occasions  of  improper  timestamps  resulting  in
stranded  files, in less than 0.5% of the cases.

The  data  storage  requirements  differ  from  system
to  system.    Buffer  length,  (e.g.  12  seconds  of  loss
monitor  data  are  stored,  4  seconds  of  power  supply
data  are  stored),  frequency  (e.g.  720Hz  for  loss
monitor  and  power  supply  data),  and  the  accuracy  of
the data all play a role in determining this requirement.
The  data  saved  in  a  post  mortem  of  power  supply
data uses approximately 145MB per event (130MB of
WFG data, 15MB of MADC data).  The loss  monitor
post mortem data uses an average of 44MB per event.
Post  mortem  data  for  a  typical  month  requires
approximately 120GB of disk space.

Other systems may be affected by the post mortem
system.  The  effect  on  other  data  collection  systems
includes  loss  of  data  due  to  frozen  hardware  buffers,
and the effect of writing a large amount of data to disk,
thereby  slowing  other  processes  and/or  making  their
data incorrect or obsolete.  The current philosophy is
that the post mortem data is the most critical.
the  beam 

loss  monitor,  current
line  ac
transformer,  dxheater,  power 
monitoring,  and  real-time  data 
link  monitoring
systems have been incorporated into the post mortem
system.  New systems are continually brought on line
as the need arises – and as resources are available.

Data 

Power  supply  data  is  analyzed  after  quench  events.
The  characteristics  of  the  power  supplies  in  the
quench location are then studied to determine why the
supply failed, if the failure was radiation induced, or if
some other type of failure occurred.  If the failure is
believed  to  be  radiation  induced,  further  analysis  of
the  loss  monitor  data  is  conducted.    The  focus  is  to
determine where and why the beam was lost in order
prevent a recurring problem.  The amount of beam loss
can be determined by studying the entire ring’s losses
along with the beam current transformer post mortem
data.

Some quotes from Operational logs:

Sunday  September  30,  2001,  1424  –  ‘The  post
mortem  plots  show  voltage  ripples  for  many  of  the
supplies,  throughout  the  ring.   Apparently  a  power
glitch had occurred.’

Friday October 6, 2001, 0234 – ‘Blue quench link
interlock.    The  post  mortem  plots  showed  that  the
voltage  was  railed  for  the  bi5-tq6  supply  before  the
link  was  pulled.  …  was  contacted  and  reported  that
the supply needs to be replaced.’

Figure 2. Power Supply and Loss Monitor Data

As shown in Figure 2, a power supply (top) – out of
regulation  before  quench  event  (time  0  is  time  of
event).  Loss monitors (bottom) show beam loss prior
to  time  of  event  –  due  to  power  supply  problem  –
enlarged picture shows loss prior to time of event.

4 THE FUTURE

New  systems,  as  appropriate,  will  be  added  to  the
post mortem system.  Items to be considered include
filtering  of  event  selections  at  the  console  level
without repeated calls to the database.  This will result
in improved UI interaction for users of the viewer.

key  issues.  In  the  usual  operation  of  KEKB,  the  bunch 
length  is  longer  than  design  value  and  it  may  cause  a 
luminosity reduction due to the hourglass effect. We tried 
negative α optics in order to shorten the bunch length [2]. 
The machine study was done on June 26th, 2003. 

Abstract 

KEKB  [1]  is  a  high  luminosity  e+e-  collider  for 
studying  B  mesons  and  has  achieved 
the  design 
luminosity  of  1034cm-2s-1  in  2003.  In  order  to  get  higher 
luminosity,  we  tested  negative  momentum  compaction 
optics  in  the  summer  of  2003.  We  measured  the  bunch 
length  using  three  methods  at  0.7mA  to  1.17mA  bunch 
current  and  confirmed  the  length  was  shortened  with  the   
negative momentum compaction optics.     

INTRODUCTION 
KEKB  is  an  e+e-  collider  for  the  B  meson  physics 
consisting  of  an  electron  ring  of  8  GeV  (HER)  and  a 
positron  ring  of  3.5  GeV  (LER)  as  shown  in  Figure1. 
Figure 2 shows the trend of peak luminosity in the world. 
KEKB achieved 10.57 /nb/s on May 13th, 2003. Figure 3 
shows  the  integrated  luminosity  of  KEKB.  We  logged 
more than 150 /fb luminosity by 2003 summer.

luminosity was achieved in 2003 summer. In order to get

design value, resulting a vertical beam-beam parameter ξy 
larger than the design value. In several machine studies on 
higher  luminosity,  shortening  the  bunch  length  with  a 
negative  momentum  compaction  factor  (α)  is  one  of  the

KEKB LATTICE 
In  order  to  achieve  a  large  dynamic  aperture,  a  non-
interleaved  chromaticity  correction  scheme  [3,  4]  has 
been  adopted  at  KEKB.  The  2.5π  cell  is  created  by 
combining  five  π/2  cells  as  shown  in  Figure  4.  In  this 
structure,  the  bending  magnets  are  arranged  to  form  two 
dispersion  bumps  and  keep  dispersion  low  at  the  dipole 
magnets.  Pairs  of  sextupole  magnets  connected  by  the 
pseudo -I’ transfer matrix are placed in the arc of the ring. 
By  this  scheme,  the  horizontal  emittance  εx  and  the 
momentum  compaction 
factor  α can  be  adjusted   
independently.

BEAM PHASE MEASUREMENT 
Switching from a positive to a negative α lattice changes 
the  synchronous  phase  φs  as  shown  in  Figure  6  [2].  The 
shift  in  the  synchronous  phase  due  to  the  parasitic  loss 
∆φs is given by

where  Vs  is  the  accelerating  cavity  voltage,  φs0  is  the 
synchronous  phase  of  a  zero-current  limit,  U0  is  the 
radiation  loss  per  turn,  k  (σ)  is  the  loss  factor,  and  T0  is 
the  revolution  period.  The  relative  beam  phase  was 
measured as a function of beam current for negative and 
positive α optics as shown in Figure 7. Assuming that the 
RF  phase  is  constant,  we  can  estimate  the  φs0  from  an 
extrapolated  phase  to  zero  current  and  the  difference 
between  negative  and  positive  α  results  ∆ψ.  The 
measured φs0 was 10.3 degree at the LER and 16.7 degree 
at  the  HER.  It  was  consistent  with  expectation  for  both 
rings.

BUNCH LENGTH MEASUREMENT 
The bunch length was measured for both negative and 
positive  α optics. We have three methods to measure the 
bunch  length  for  KEKB  [5].  First  is  the  RMS  bunch 
length monitor, second is the RF wave-guide system and 
third  is  the  streak  camera.  All  three  methods  were  used 
for this study to check the consistency.     

RMS Bunch Length Monitor  

The  bunch  length  is  evaluated  by  detecting  two 

frequency components of the bunch spectrum as

In  this  monitor,  the  bunch  signal  is  picked  up  by  a 
button  electrode  installed  on  a  beam  pipe  and  the  bunch 
length  is  calculated  by  an  analog  calculator  unit  for  the 
real  time  measurement.  Figure  8  shows  the  relation 
between  the  amplitude  ratio  and  bunch  length.  The 
resolution  of  the  measurement  is  estimated  to  be  about 
0.2mm at 4mm bunch length.

RF Wave-Guide System 

The  bunch  length  can  be  evaluated  from  a  beam 
spectrum  measurement  of  the  beam-induced  field  in  an 
RF cavity. In order to detect the field, a wideband pickup 
is mounted on the wave-guide of the RF system (Figure 9 
(a)). Since the wavelengths of the field components above 
5GHz  are  much  smaller  than  the  size  of  wave  guide, 
almost all components pass through the wave-guide.  The 
bunch  length  is  estimated  by  fitting  the  spectrum 
envelope  using  a  Gaussian with  the  fitting parameters  of 
the  bunch  length  σl  and  the  normalization  factor  a  as 
shown in Figure 9 (b). The fitting function is

The direct observation of the bunch length is performed 
using a streak camera with reflected optics to increase the 
the 
light 
individual  beam  bunch  produced  in  the  weak  bending 
magnet installed in the KEKB ring. The bunch-by-bunch 
shapes were observed as shown in Figure 10. In the case 
of negative α optics, the bunch shape is asymmetrical. It 
may be a consequence of potential well distortion effects.

Results 

Figure 11 shows the results of three methods for bunch 
length  measurement  in  the  LER.  Solid  marks  show  the 
negative  α  optics  and  open  marks  show  the  positive  α 
optics. All of three methods for the negative α case show 

a shorter bunch length than that of positive α optics. The 
shortening  of  the  bunch  length  is  enhanced  as  the  bunch 
current increases although the calculation shown in Table 
2 predicts a small effect on the bunch length in the zero-
current limit. The bunch length of the HER was measured 
only by the RMS bunch length monitor (Figure 12) and it 
was also shorter at negative  α optics.  

SUMMARY 
The  flexible  KEKB  lattice  enables  us  to  adjust  the 
horizontal  emittance  and  momentum  compaction  factor 
independently.  Lattice  setting  of  negative  α  optics  was 
successfully done. The synchrotron tune is consistent with 
the  calculated  value  and  the  beam  phases  were  changed 
between  negative  and  positive  α  optics  as  expected.  We 
confirmed that bunch lengthening was reduced at negative 
α  optics  using  the  three  methods.  The  bunch  length 
shortening using the negative α lattice has the potential to 
increase the KEKB luminosity further.

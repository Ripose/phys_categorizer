Abstract 

Twelve  pulsed  γΤ  quads  have  been  installed  in  the  Booster  to  provide  fast  transition 

crossing.    The  less  time  the  beam  stays  in  the  non-adiabatic  period  near  transition,  the 

less  the  longitudinal  emittance  grows.    From  the  past  experience,  the  γΤ  quads  are  not 

well aligned relative to the usual closed orbit.  Quad steering can cause beam loss and a 

dispersion wave after transition.  To make the γΤ quads routinely operational, procedures 

for finding the center of the beam relative to the quads and centering the beam through all 

of  them  are  very  important.    A  program,  which  uses  the  difference  in  the  closed  orbits 

when γΤ  quads are on and off and calculates the offsets of the beam relative to γΤ  quads, 

has  been  developed  and  tested.    A  radial  orbit  offset  (ROF)  of  about  3  mm  has  been 

experimentally determined to be nearly the optimal radial position for centering the beam 

through  all  the  γΤ  quads,  thereby  eliminating  the  immediate  need  for  repositioning  the 

quads. 

Introduction 

It  has  been  very  helpful  to  make  a  specialized  program  to  analyze  the  quad  steering  at 

known positions in the Fermilab Booster from the difference orbit taken with the γΤ quads 

on and off.  There are 48 beam position monitors (BPM) used in Booster for monitoring 

the beam positions both horizontally and vertically.[1]  Twelve pulsed  γΤ  quads, which 

were  designed  to  change  γΤ   one  unit  within  100  µs,  have  been  installed  to  make  the 

transition  crossing  faster  to  avoid  longitudinal  emittance  growth.    Because  they  are  not 

perfectly aligned, they steer the beam and can cause beam loss when they are pulsed.  A 

program has been developed and tested for finding the offsets of γΤ  quads by calculating 

the angle kicks at γΤ  quad locations from the difference orbit taken from the BPM data.  

Once angle kicks at γΤ  quad locations are known from the program, beam offsets at γΤ  

 

1

quad  locations  can  be  calculated  with  known  γΤ   quad  parameters.    Either  by  adding 

position bumps or by moving the quads, the γΤ  quad steering can be minimized. 

Because  we  want  to  find  twelve  γΤ   quad  angle  kicks  from  forty-eight  BPM 

readings,  the  least  squares  method  has  been  used  in  the  analysis.    The  calculated  quad 

kicks are used to predict the difference orbit, and the result is compared to the BPM data.  

The predicted difference orbit matches that measured from the BPM data quite well, and 

the root-mean-square (RMS) is less than 0.2 mm at the ROF value of 3.

Here, si is the longitudinal position (LP) where the transverse displacement is observed, 

and sj is the LP of the angle kick.  µ(si)- µ(sj) is the phase advance between si and sj.  

νx is the betatron tune in the x direction.  n is the total number of angle kicks.  When the 

number of places where transverse displacements are observed is greater than the number 

of places where angle kicks appear, there is more than enough information to solve eq.(1) 

for  the  angular  kicks.    The  least  squares  method  is  used  to  find  the  optimal  solution.  

Eq.(2) is used to find the angle kicks from the measured difference orbit. 

                                                                                                            (2) 

n = 12 is the number of angle kicks; the matrix  ℜ  is  

 m = 48 is the number of BPM’s; A is a 48 by 12 matrix defined in eq. 1.  Array B is 

ix∆  is the difference orbit between conditions of γΤ  quads on and off at LP si. 

 xj is the offset of the center of the beam relative to the center of the γΤ  quad at LP sj:

Experimental Results 
All the experiments were done at the extracted beam intensity of 0.315×1012 protons.  A 

programmed radial offset (ROF) was used to move the beam radially when the γΤ quads 

were pulsed to establish the ROF setting where the beam was best centered through all 

the  γΤ  quads.    The  difference  orbit  between  γΤ  quads  on  and  off  was  found  at  eight 

different ROF values, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; the results are shown in Fig. 1.  All the orbits 

with γΤ quads on were taken at the same γΤ quad current of 780 A.  The black, red, green, 

blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, dark yellow curves represent eight different ROF values of  

-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.  It is clear that the beam is best centered through all the 

γΤ  quads  at  the  ROF  value  of  3.    The  angle  kicks  at  the  12  γΤ  quad  locations  were 

calculated  from  the  difference  orbits  in  Fig.  1  using  the  least  squares  program,  and  the 

results were used for predicting the difference orbit.  The black, red curves in Figs. 2(a)-

2(h) represent the predicted difference orbit and the measured difference orbit from BPM 

data at eight different ROF values of -2 to 5 respectively.  The differences between the 

measured difference orbits and the predicted difference orbits at eight ROF values of -2 

to 5 are shown in Fig. 3(a).  The predicted and measured difference orbits agree with each 

other quite well, especially at the ROF value of 3, and the RMS of their differences are 

shown in Fig. 3(b).  The calculated angle kicks at 12 γΤ quad locations with ROF values 

of -2 to 5 are shown Fig. 4(a), and the calculated offsets of the beam relative to γΤ quads 

are  shown  in  Fig.  4(b).    The  difference  orbits,  angle  kicks,  and  offsets  in  the  vertical 

direction are shown in Fig. 5(a)-5(c) respectively.   

Conclusion 

The  angle  kicks  from  twelve  pulsed  γΤ  quads  have  been  calculated  from  the  difference 

orbit  taken  with  γΤ  quads  on  and  off  using  a  least  squares  fitting  technique.    The  ROF 

value  of  3  (about  3  mm)  has  been  experimentally  determined  to  be  the  optimal  radial 

offset for centering the beam through all the γΤ quads at the time they are pulsed.

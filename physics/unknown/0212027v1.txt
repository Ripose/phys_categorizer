Abstract

The  analytic  physics,  when  it  is  development  from  aprioristic  form,  constructs  all  the

laws  from  the  Hamilton  principle,  also  called  action  principle.  According  to  this

principle all systems are characterized by a magnitude called action which variation is

equal to zero for the real evolution of the systems. At first, do not exist restrictions for

the  mathematical  form  of  the  action  function,  nonetheless,  as  in  the  a  posteriori

developer of the analytic  physics,  the  traditional equations  of  the  physics lead  up  to  a

scalar action, it is always sure that the action may be a scalar function. In this article we

propose the existence of a tensorial function like origin of the traditional scalar action.

First because it permits, without other argumens, to justify the own action principle and

second because it permits connect the complementary principle of the Quantum physics

with  the  analytic  expressions  of  the  nonquantum  physics,  including  the  General

Relativity.  We  call  tensorial  action  to  this  original  function  and  their  components  are

connecting,  directly,  with  the  tensorial  (spinorial)  componets  of  the  wave  function  of

the particles with spin higher than zero. For this reason we can understand why in the

nonquantum physics only has significance a scalar action.

Tensorial origin of the action function.

All physical theory, either classic, relativistic or quantum, mechanics of material

points,  of  solid  or  of  fluids,  of  fields,  etc.,  can  be  developed  begining  from  a  single

principle  well-known  like  the  Hamilton´s  principle  or  action  principle.  Its  enunciated

for  the  mechanics  is  [1,  §2]:  All  mechanical  systems  are  characterized  by  a  function

=

L

&

tqqL
),
,(

 called lagrangian function and the real movement of the system satisfies

the following condition:

δ

S

t
= ∫
δ

),
,(
tqqL

dt

&

(1)

This  enunciated  is  completely  similar  for  any  physics  branch.  In  more  general

way  we  can  rewrite  this  enunciated  in  the  next  form:  “All  physical  systems  are

characterized  by  a  magnitude  S  called  action  which  is  defined  by 

)(
tS

∫=

,(
tqqL
),

dt

&

and for a real evolution of the system q = q(t) takes a extreme value” [2, §8].

The different physical theories can be built starting from this principle only give

a  concrete  mathematical  expression  for 

the 

lagrangian  and 

the  generalized

coordinateses.  Likewise,  if  one  makes  the  variation  (1)  we  obtained  Euler-Lagrange

equations that to the being resolved show the physical properties of the system.

All physical property of any system, just  as it  can  be:  the second  Newton  law,

the energy  conservation  principle,  the  light trajectory,  the  Schrödinger equation or the

Dirac  one,  the  Bernouilli  fluids  equation,  etc,  all  of  they  can  be  deduced  by  a  action

principle  when  the  action  adopts  the  appropriate  expression,  in  according  to  the

mathematical apparatus that is used in such a theory.

In  this  form,  the  action  principle  is  the  last  and  the  only  explanation  for  all

physical  property  of  a  system.  The  whole  physical  science  decreases  to  a  single

principle although this has several mathematical realizations depending of the branch of

the physics that is applied.

2

But, why should all physical systems obey the  action principle?, that is to  say,

why  should  all  physical  systems  be  characterized  by  a  magnitude  which  becomes
extreme? The explanation is not in the physics, but in the math2.

Let  us  suppose  that  we  have  a  tensorial  function 

...

ijkS

    which  represents

mathematically to our system.

According  to  a  well-known  theorem  of  the  tensorial  calculation  [3  §3.3]:  the

scalar product 

i BA
i

 is invariable before a transformations of coordinated.

This  result  can  be  generalize  easily:  Let 

i
}{
x

and

i
}'{
x

  be  two  systems  of

coordinated.  The  transformation  from  a  system  of  coordinate  to  the  other  one,  for  a

tensile covariant, has the form:

Applying this result to the scalar product of one tensor times itself:

When makes a variation of a magnitude,  it  is  varying in  relation  to the objects

which  has  same  variables  in  this  magnitude.  In  the  case  of  tensors  whose  indexes

reference  to  the  coordinates  on  which  makes  the  variation,  this  variation  go  with  the

corresponding transformation of the coordinates. According to this, by virtue of (2) be

deduce:

Sδ
(

2 The Feynman method of the path integral, although it allows to deduce the Hamilton
principle of the classic physics or the Schödinger equation of the quantum physics, it is
not  in  itself  a  demonstration,  because  it  comes  to  substitute  an  axiom  (the  Hamilton
principle) for another axiom (the call Feynman’s principle of the democratic equality of
all histories).

The  scalar  product  of  two  tensors  is,  indeed,  a  scalar.  Therefore,  in  the  scalar

product of a tensor times itself the result it is a  square scalar, this is 

2S  (starting from

here it will be denoted the scalars with underlined).

Substituting this result in (3) it is obtained 

Sδ
(

2 =

 that to being the square of

a scalar can be operate until to obtain

S δ

For  check  this  relationship  it  should  be  made  zero  at  least  one  of  the  two

multiplicand, that  is to say or S =  0  or 

.  But,  if  the  first  one  is  completed  the

0=Sδ

second one is always completed, then in anyway to be completed that:

0=Sδ

(4)

In consequence: if the tensor S ijk... characterizes to a physical system completely,

then it is verify the relationship (4) which is identical to the Hamilton principle (1).

If  we  consider  the  existence  of  a  tensorial  function  which  characterizes  to  the

system completely, all the physical properties of the system are deduced mathematically

from the formalism which is used to represent the physical objects.

The tesorial action in quantum.

In quantum, the correspondence principle [78 §7] takes to the expresion:

This  expression  is  valid  so  much  in  nonrelativistic  quantum  [5  §15]  like  in  the

relativistic [6  §2.1].  It  can  express  in  4-vectorial  notation  in  a  simple  form  making  the

same process used in special relativity:

On  the  other  hand,  when  the  action  is  a  physical  magnitude  dependent  of  the

coordinateses, adopts, so much for the mechanics of material points [1 §43], like for the

fields theory [2 §9], the form:

The development utilized for arrive to the expression (7) is relativistic invariant

just as it guarantees all the equations utilized.

In relativistic quantum the wave functions are tensorial according to the spin of

the  system.  That  is  to  say,  for  spin  0  the  wave  function  is  a  scalar,  for  spin  ½  it  is

vectorial (spinorial) [6 §3.3], for spin 1 it is a matrix [6 §5.1] and in general case, for spin

n/2 the wave function will be a n indexes tensor [6  §5.3]. Applying this concept to  the

expression (7) is obtained:

ˆ
S

Ψ

(

ijk

...

...

)

Ψ−=
i
h

ijk

...

(8)

That  is  to  say,  it  is  necessary  to  adopt  that  the  operator  action  is  tensorial  to

guarantee the tensorial character of the expression.

The wave function, just as it is represented in the expression (8), is not identified

exactly with the Dirac wave function. For the Dirac wave function the scalar 

2Ψ  has the

form 

ΨΨ +
γ
0

 being 

γ  the gamma zero matrix. However, the expression (8) plays to a

0

to scalar with the form 

ΨΨ=Ψ

2

+G

 being G the metric matrix, whose properties are

very different to properties of the gamma zero matrix.

To transform some wave functions in the other ones first we should restrict the

expression  (8)  to  the  case  of  the  Minkowski  space  and  later  to  compare  the  scalar

5

products. Making this it is obtained, for the case of spin ½, that all the components are

equal except the second one which will have the form 

Ψ

Dirac

Ψ−=

vectorial

.

The expresion (8), as well as can to demonstrate the action principle in quantum

(because it is a tensorial action) also it allows to deduce the most important principles of

the quantum physics, besides to explain the reason why the physics for the present has

not applied the magnitude action like a tensor.

The overlapping principle.

Let us suppose two independent and isolated systems 1 and 2, characterized by

their corresponding tensorial actions S1 and S2 (starting from here the notation used will

be without indexes for the tensors, for further clarity, all the magnitudes in capitals will

be  tensorials,  the  scalars  will  be  denoted  by  minuscule  or  underlined  capitals.  In  this

form, the superindexes will denote exponents and the subindexes will refer the system

to which refer the expression). The sum of both actions, multiplied for constant a and b

has the form S = aS1 + bS2. Its square is:

(9)

When  the  systems  1  and  2  is  orthogonal,  that  is  to  say,  they  are  different

stationary  states  of  the  same  system,  the  product  to  climb  S1·S2  is  made  zero  and  the

expression (9) reduce to 

S

As 

Sδ

  and 

Sδ
(

)

=

0

  then  from  the  last  expression  is  deduced

automatically  that 

Sδ
(

2 =
)

0

.  That  is  to  say,  the  tensor  S  =  aS1  +  bS2  completes  the

action principle. Applying (8) it is obtained:

which is known as the states overlapping principle [5 §2].

The last expression coincides with the action principle again,  for a  form of the

action similar to S12 = S1·S2. Substituting here the expression (8) it is obtained:

This last expression coincides with the action principle again, for a form of the

action similar to S1·S2. As this product of tensorial actions is like a scalar, this indicates

us  this  product  should  coincide  with  a  square  tensorial  action,  that  is  to  say:

This  expression  play  to  the  Born´s  probabilistic  principle  [4  §11]  since  it

interprets the wave function which characterizes to a composed system as the product of

the singular wave functions, the same way as a probabilistic magnitude work [5 §2].

The condition of normalization of the wave function.

The expression (8) it drives directly to

This  expression  indicate  the  integral  should  be  convergent  and  therefore  the

function

q

  behaves  like  a  probability  distribution.  As  the  lineality  of  the

wave function, the constant is arbitrary and we can fix it for usefulness. When we make

this  constant  similar  to  1,  the  expression  (12)  takes  the  well-known  form  like

normalization condition [5 §2].

The action like scalar magnitude in the traditional physics.

The expression (8) also explains why the tensorial action is not used in classical

physics,  relativistical  physic,  nonrelativistical  quantum  and  even  in  relativistical

quantum.

Firstly, in classical physics and in relativistical physic the concept of spin doesn't

exist,  or  in  another  form,  always  the  spin  is  zero  in  no-quantum  systems  [5  §54].

Therefore in these systems the action is scalar.

On  the  other  hand,  the  norelativistical  quantum  is  developed  basically  for

particles  without  spin  [5  §54].  No  will  be  up  to  1925  that  G.  Uhlenberk  proposes  the

existence of an intrinsic angular momentum for the electron like explanation of the call

effect anomalous Zeemann [7 §§3.6 and 3.7] and in 1927 W. Pauli introduces the spin in

the  formalism  of  wave  functions  [5  §54]  as  a  special  vector,  calls  espinor,  which

multiplies  to  the  traditionally  scalar  wave  function  [5  §55].  Due  to  this  method  to

introduce the spin, the nonrelativistical quantum continue deducing from a scalar action.

The  case  of  the  relativistical  quantum  mechanics  is  different.  Although  the

Dirac´s equation, for example, is obtained when solving the relativistical expression of

the  energy  [6  §3.1],  the  result  that  one  obtains  it  is  vectorial  (espinorial)  [6  §3.3].

However,  the  usage,  a  priori,  of  the  Minkowski  metric  [6  §1.4]  as  geometry  of  the  4-

space in relativistical quantum makes unnecessary the tensorial character of the action

(in this metric the space is plane and 

) to exception of we want to demonstrate

0=i

klmR

the  action  principle  or  the  substitution  principle  for  potential  in  the  wave  equation  [6

§7.8] both things outside of the current physics just as we knew it.

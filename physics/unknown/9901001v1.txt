Besides two fundamental postulates, (i) the principle of relativity and (ii) the constancy of the one-
way  speed  of  light  in  all  inertial  frames  of  reference,  the  special  theory  of  relativity  uses  the  assumption
about  the  Euclidean  structure  of  gravity-free  space  and  the  homogeneity  of  gravity-free  time  in  the  usual
inertial  coordinate  system.  Introducing  the  so-called  primed  inertial  coordinate  system,  in  addition  to  the
usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  for  each  inertial  frame  of  reference,  we  assume  the  flat  structures  of
gravity-free space and time in the primed inertial coordinate system and, hence, their generalized Finslerian
structures  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  We  further  modify  the  special  theory  of  relativity  by
combining  the  alternative  assumption  with  the  two  postulates  (i)  and  (ii).  The  modified  special  relativity
theory involves two versions of the light speed, infinite  speed  c’  in  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system
and  finite  speed  c  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  It  involves  the  c’-type  Galilean  transformation
between any two primed inertial coordinate systems and the localized Lorentz transformation between any
two usual inertial coordinate systems. The physical principle in the modified special relativity theory is: the
c’-type Galilean invariance in the primed inertial coordinate system plus the transformation from the primed
to  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems.  It  combines  with  the  quantum  mechanics  theory  to  found  a
convergent  and  invariant  quantum  field  theory.  We  produce  corrections  to  the  Maxwellian  velocity  and
velocity rate distributions for free particles. The detection of velocity and velocity rate distributions for free
particles can serve as the tests to investigate the local structures of gravity-free space and time.

I. INTRODUCTION

The current Lorentz-invariant field theory, whether classical or quantum, has been suffering from
the  divergence  difficulties  for  a  long  time.  Indeed,  the  infinite  self-energy  of  an  electron  in  quantum
electrodynamics was known as early as 1929 [1], while that in classical electrodynamics was known earlier.
The origins of these difficulties lay deep within the conceptual foundations of the theory. Two foundation
stones  of  the  current  quantum  field  theory  are  the  special  relativity  theory  and  the  quantum  mechanics
theory.  Since  it  is  the  case  that  both  classical  and  quantum  field  theory  are  plagued  by  the  divergence
difficulties, the direction to get to the roots of these difficulties seems to be in the special relativity theory.

According  to  the  special  relativity  theory,  the  energy  of  a  particle  is  not  an  invariant,  and  the
transformation  properties  of  the  total  energy  of  many-particle  systems  are  completely  not  clear  under  the
Lorentz transformation because simultaneity at distant space points in a given inertial frame of reference is
no  longer  simultaneous  in  any  different  inertial  frame  of  reference.  Also,  relativistic  time  appears  to  be
incompatible with the canonical notion of evolution of many-particle systems. These and other, such as the
Lorentz  non-invariance  of  box  volume,  cause  much  difficulties  in  constructing  the  Lorentz-invariant
statistical mechanics and the Lorentz-invariant thermodynamics of many-particle systems in the framework
of the special relativity theory [2].

Although  the  special  theory  of  relativity  has  been  enormously  successful  in  explaining  various
physical phenomena and has been tested to very high degree of precision, the above difficulties in quantum
field theory and Lorentz-invariant statistical mechanics indicate that it is not a  ultimate  theory.  A  kind  of
modification is needed for it. Probably just because of this, the question “Is the special theory of relativity,
for reasons unspecified and unknown, only an  approximate  symmetry  of  nature?”  was  raised  [3],  and  the
neutrino  and  Kaon  tests  were  proposed  to  investigate  possible  violations  of  the  local  Lorentz  invariance
[3,4].

In this paper, we are concerned with a new notion about the local structures of gravity-free space
and  time,  based  on  which  we  propose  a  modified  special  relativity  theory.  The  paper  consists  of  twelve
sections. In the next section, we analyze experimental facts for indication how to modify the special theory
of relativity. The experimental indication is quite explicit. With this indication, we go back to the special
relativity  theory  in  Section  III  and  show  that  it  actually  uses  the  assumption  about  the  flat  structures  of

1

gravity-free space and time in the usual inertial coordinate  system  besides  two  fundamental  postulates  on
the  principle  of  relativity  and  the  speed  of  light.  We  are  going  to  make  our  assumption  about  the  local
structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time,  in  connection  with  generalized  Finsler  geometry.  But,  since
Finsler geometry and its generalization are not familiar to many people, we make an instruction to Finsler
geometry  and  generalized  Finsler  geometry  first,  in  Section  IV,  and  our  assumption  later,  in  Section  V.
Section  VI  addresses  the  modified  special  relativity  theory  that  is  formed  by  combining  the  alternative
assumption  with  the  two  fundamental  postulates.  Section  VII  is  devoted  to  the  physical  principle  in  the
modified special relativity theory. Then, in Sections VIII and IX, we sketch the applications of this principle
to reform of mechanics and field theory. We also sketch how the modified special relativity theory and the
quantum mechanics theory  together  found  a  convergent  and  invariant  quantum  field  theory.  Readers  who
are interested in detailed derivations may refer to Ref.[24]. There, the knowledge of the Cartan connection
in the generalized Finsler geometry is necessary. In Section X, we discuss the velocity-space in the modified
special  relativity  theory.  This  discussion  eventully  leads  to  corrections  to  the  Maxwellian  velocity  and
velocity rate distributions of free particles, which are shown in Section XI. Finally, in Section XII, we make
some concluding remarks.

II. EXPERIMENTAL INDICATION

Because of technological limitations, in the earlier experiments testing the constancy or isotropy of
the light speed, light was propagated in a closed path. The favorite conclusions from these experiments are
explicitly  for  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of  the  round-trip  propagating  light,  not  for  that  of  the  one-way
speed  of  light.  As  a  result  of  the  technological  development,  many  experiments  have  been  done  in  the
manner  that  light  propagates  in  a  one-way.  Turner  and  Hill  [5]  and  Champeney  et  al  [6],  both  research
groups did experiments using the Mossbauer effect. They placed a Co57 source near the rim of a standard
centrifuge with an iron absorber near the axis of rotation. The Mossbauer effect was to look for any velocity
dependence of the frequency of the 14.4 KeV g -rays as seen by the Fe57 in the absorber. Their experiments
established limits of D c/c<2x10-10 for the anisotropy in the one-way speed of light. Riis and his colleagues
[7] compared the frequency of a two-photon transition in a fast atomic beam to that of a stationary absorber
while  the  direction  of  the  fast  beam  is  rotated  relative  to  the  fixed  stars.  They  found  the  upper  limit
D c/c<3.5x10-9  firstly  and  D c/c<2x10-11  later  for  the  anisotropy.  The  experiment  of  Krisher  et  al  [8]  was
made  by  use  of  highly  stable  hydrogen-maser  frequency  standards  (clocks)  separated  by  over  21  km  and
connected by a ultrastable fiber optics link. They compared the phases of the standards and produced the
limits  from  the  experimental  data,  D c/c<2x10-7  and D c/c<2x10-8  for  linear  and  quadratic  dependencies,
respectively, on the velocity of the Earth with respect to the cosmic microwave background. 

All experimental tests of the constancy of the one-way light speed can be also interpreted as the
tests of the local Lorentz invariance. Nevertheless, since local Lorentz non-invariance implies a departure
from the Einstein time dilation and singles out a preferred inertial frame of reference, the experiments done
by McGowan et al [9], Bailey et al [10], Kaivola et al [11], Prestage et al [12], and Krisher et al [8] can be
accounted immediate testing the local Lorentz invariance. Bailey et al, Kaivola et al, and McGowan et al
verified the Einstein time dilation to an accuracy of 1x10-3, 4x10-5 and 2.3x10-6 respectively. Experiments of
Prestage et al and Krisher et al are sensitive to the effects of motion of their experimental apparatus relative
to a preferred inertial frame of reference and sensitive to the form of time dilation coefficient of the used
hydrogen-maser clocks. The explicitly null results were yielded in these two experiments for breakdown of
the local Lorentz invariance.

Experiments clearly support the existence of the constancy of the one-way light speed, the Einstein
velocity  addition  law  and  the  local  Lorentz  invariance  [5-13].  The  experimental  indication  is:  any
modification of the special relativity theory must keep the constancy of the one-way speed of light and the
local Lorentz invariance.

III. THE SPECIAL RELATIVITY THEORY

Einstein  published  his  special  theory  of  relativity  in  1905  [14].  He  derived  the  Lorentz
transformation between any two usual inertial coordinate systems, which is the kinematical background for
the physical principle of the Lorentz invariance. The two fundamental postulates stated by Einstein as the

2

basis for his theory are (i) the principle of relativity and (ii) the constancy of the one-way speed of light in
all  inertial  frames  of  reference.  Besides  these  two  fundamental  postulates,  the  special  theory  of  relativity
also uses another assumption. This other assumption concerns the Euclidean structure of gravity-free space
and the homogeneity of gravity-free time in the usual inertial coordinate system {xr,t}, r=1,2,3, x1=x, x2=y,
x3=z,

rsdxrdxs, r,s=1,2,3,

dX2=d
dT2=dt2,
everywhere and every time.
 
Postulates  (i)  and  (ii)  and  the  assumption  Eqs.(1)  together  yield  the  Lorentz  transformation
between any two usual inertial coordinate systems [14-18]. Indeed, though the assumption Eqs.(1) was not
explicitly  articulated,  evidently  having  been  considered  self-evident,  Einstein  said  in  1907:  “Since  the
propagation velocity of light in empty space is c with respect to both reference systems, the two equations,
2=0,  must  be  equivalent.”  [17].  Leaving  aside  a  discussion  of
x1
whether  postulate  (i)  implies  the  linearity  of  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate
systems  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative  velocities  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  we
know  that  the  two  equivalent  equations,  the  linearity  of  transformation  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative
velocities lead to the Lorentz transformation.

Some  physicists  explicitly  articulated  the  assumption  Eqs.(1)  in  their  works  on  the  topic.  Pauli
wrote:  “This  also  implies  the  validity  of  Euclidean  geometry  and  the  homogeneous  nature  of  space  and
time.”  [16],  Fock  said:  “The  logical  foundation  of  these  methods  is,  in  principle,  the  hypothesis  that
Euclidean  geometry  is  applicable  to  real  physical  space  together  with  further  assumptions,  viz.  that  rigid
bodies exist and that light travels in straight lines.” [18].

Minkowski [19] showed in 1909 that the Lorentz transformation is just a rotation in four-dimensional space-
time. He also showed how to use the  four-dimensional  tensor  analysis  for  writing  invariant  physical  laws
under the Lorentz transformation. The Minkowskian structure  Eq.(2)  is  a  four-dimensional  version  of  the
assumption Eqs.(1).

IV. GENERALIZED FINSLER GEOMETRY

Finsler geometry is a kind of generalization of Riemann geometry [20-22]. It was first suggested
by Riemann as early as 1854, and studied systematically by Finsler in 1918. Since then, the most significant
work from the viewpoint of modern differential geometry has been done by Cartan, Rund and others.

In  Finsler  geometry,  distance  ds  between  two  neighboring  points  xk  and  xk+dxk,  k=1,2,---,n  is

defined by a scale function

ds=F(x1,x2,---,xn;dx1,dx2,---dxn)

or simply

ds=F(xk,dxk),  k=1,2,---,n,

which depends on directional variables dxk as well as coordinate  variables  xk.  Apart  from  several  routine
conditions  like  smoothness,  the  main  constraint  imposed  on  this  scale  function  is  that  it  is  positively
homogeneous of degree one in dxk,

F(xk,l dxk)=l F(xk,dxk)  for l >0.

Introducing a set of equations
gij(xk,dxk)= ¶

 2F2(xk,dxk)/2 ¶ dxi ¶ dxj,  i,j=1,2,---,n,

we can represent Finsler geometry in terms of

ds2=gij(xk,dxk)dxidxj, 

where gij(xk,dxk) is called the Finslerian metric tensor induced from scale function F(xk,dxk). The Finslerian
metric  tensor  is  symmetric  in  its  subscripts  and  all  its  components  are  positively  homogeneous  of  degree
zero in dxk,

gij(xk,dxk)=gji(xk,dxk),
gij(xk,l dxk)=gij(xk,dxk)  for l >0.

We can define the so-called generalized Finsler geometry by omitting Eq.(3) as a definition of ds
and instead taking Eq.(6) as a  definition  of  ds2,  where  the  given  metric  tensor  gij(xk,dxk)  satisfies  Eqs.(7)
and

det[gij(xk,dxk)] „ 0,

and

gij(xk,dxk)dxidxj>0,  i,j=1,2,---,n,

for non-zero vector dxi.

The generalized Finsler geometry is so-named because a Finsler geometry must be a generalized
Finsler geometry but the inverse statement is not valid, in other words, a generalized Finsler geometry is not
necessarily a Finsler geometry [21].

A  generalized  Finsler  geometry  with  a  given  metric  tensor  gij(xk,dxk)  is  also  a  Finsler  geometry
when and only when we can find a scale function F(xk,dxk) by solving the set of equations, Eqs.(5), such
that this function is not only positive if not all dxk are simultaneously zero but also positively homogeneous
of degree one in dxk. In this case, F2(xk,dxk) is positively homogeneous of degree two in dxk. The following
equation thus holds due to Euler’s theorem on homogeneous functions,

2F2(xk,dxk)= dxi [ ¶ F2(xk,dxk)/ ¶ dxi].

Iterating Eq.(8), we find
4F2(xk,dxk)= dxj d

ij[ ¶ F2(xk,dxk)/ ¶ dxi]
+dxj dxi[ ¶ 2F2(xk,dxk)/  ¶ dxj ¶ dxi].

It then follows from use of Eq.(8) that

F2(xk,dxk)= dxj dxi[ ¶ 2F2(xk,dxk)/ 2 ¶ dxj ¶ dxi].
Eq.(10) combines with Eqs.(5) and (6) to yield Eq.(3).

Like Finsler geometry, generalized Finsler geometry can be endowed with the Cartan connection.
Relying  on  that,  we  can  define  absolute  defferentials  and  covariant  partial  derivatives  of  vectors  and
tensors.

V. A NEW ASSUMPTION ON LOCAL STRUCTURES OF SPACE AND TIME

Conceptually, the principle of relativity means that there exists a class of equivalent inertial frames
of  reference,  any  one  of  which  moves  with  a  non-zero  constant  velocity  relative  to  any  other.  Einstein
wrote: “in a given inertial frame of reference the coordinates mean the results of certain measurements with
rigid (motionless) rods, a clock at rest relative to the inertial frame of reference defines a local time, and the
local time at all points of space, indicated by synchronized clocks and taken together, give the time of this
inertial frame of reference.”[15]. As defined by Einstein, each of the inertial frames of reference is supplied
with motionless, rigid unit rods of equal length and motionless, synchronized clocks of equal running rate.
Then,  in  each  inertial  frame  of  reference,  an  observer  can  employ  his  own    motionless-rigid  rods  and
motionless-synchronized clocks in the so-called “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock”
measurement  method  to  measure  space  and  time  intervals.  By  using  this  “motionless-rigid  rod  and
motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method, the observer in each inertial frame of reference can
set up his own usual inertial coordinate system. Postulate (ii) means that the speed of light is measured to be
the same constant c in every such usual inertial coordinate system.

The  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement  method  is  not  the
only one that each inertial frame of reference has. We imagine, for each inertial frame of reference, other
measurement methods that are different from the “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock”
measurement  method.  By  taking  these  other  measurement  methods,  an  observer  in  each  inertial  frame  of
reference  can  set  up  other  inertial  coordinate  systems,  just  as  well  as  he  can  set  up  his  usual  inertial
coordinate  system  by  taking  the    “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement
method. We call these other inertial coordinate systems the unusual inertial coordinate systems.

The  conventional  belief  in  flatness  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  is  natural.  But  question  is,  in
which inertial coordinate system the gravity-free space and time directly display their flatness. The special
theory of relativity recognizes the usual inertial coordinate system, as shown in Eqs.(1). Making a different
choice,  we  take  one  of  the  unusual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  say  {x’r,t’},  r=1,2,3,  the  primed  inertial
coordinate  system.  We  assume  that  gravity-free  space  and  time  possess  the  flat  metric  structures  in  the

4

rsdx’rdx’s=grs(y)dxrdxs,   r,s=1,2,3, 

primed  inertial  coordinate  system,  and  hence,  the  following  generalized  Finslerian  structures  in  the  usual
inertial coordinate system,

Two metric tensors grs(y) and g(y)  depend  only  on  directional  variables  ys,  s=1,2,3,  and  become

flat when and only when y approaches zero.
 

VI. THE MODIFIED SPECIAL RELATIVITY THEORY

We  modify  the  special  theory  of  relativity  by  combining  the  alternative  assumption  Eqs.(11),

instead of the assumption Eqs.(1), with the two postulates (i) and (ii).

If we define a new type of velocity, y’s=dx’s/dt’, s=1,2,3, in the primed inertial coordinate system
and keep the well-defined usual (Newtonian) velocity in the usual inertial coordinate system, we find from
the assumption Eqs.(11)

where  y’=(y’sy’s)1/2,  s=1,2,3.  It  is  understood  that  two  different  measurement  methods  can  be  applied  to  a
motion when the motion is observed in an inertial frame of reference, one being the “motionless-rigid rod
and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method, the other one being associated with the primed
inertial coordinate system. As a result, two different velocities are obtained, primed velocity y’s (of the new
type) and usual velocity ys. These two velocities are related by Eqs.(12) and (13). Velocities y’s and ys are
two versions of the motion obtained via two different measurement methods used  in  the  inertial  frame  of
reference. The Galilean addition among primed velocities links up with the Einstein addition among usual
velocities [23]. This statement can be easily seen in the one-dimensional case that

y’2= y’1 -u’=(c/2)ln[(c+y1)/(c-y1)] -(c/2)ln[(c+u)/(c-u)]

and

imply

y’2=(c/2)ln[(c+y2)/(c-y2)]

y2=(y1-u)/(1-y1u/c2).
In Eq.(13), as y goes to c, we get an infinite primed speed,

Speed c’ is invariant in the primed inertial coordinate systems simply because of the invariance of speed c
in the usual inertial coordinate systems. Speed c’ is really a new version of the light speed, its version in the
primed inertial coordinate systems.

Let  IFR1  and  IFR2  be  two  inertial  frames  of  reference,  where  IFR2  moves  with  a  non-zero
constant velocity relative to IFR1. IFR1 and IFR2 can use their own “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-
synchronized clock” measurement methods and set up their own usual inertial coordinate systems {xr
m,tm},
m=1,2.  They  can  also  set  up  their  own  primed  inertial  coordinate  systems,  {x’r
m,t’m},  m=1,2.  Since  the
propagation velocity of light is c’ in both {x’r

Two  equivalent  equations  Eqs.(15),  the  linearity  of  transformation  between  two  {x’r

m,t’m},  the
reciprocity of relative velocities between two {x’r
m,t’m}, and the flat structures of gravity-free space and time
in  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  systems  will  lead  to  the  c’-type  Galilean  transformation  between  two
primed  inertial  coordinate  systems  {x’r
m,t’m},  m=1,2,  under  which  speed  c’  is  invariant.  Two  equivalent
equations  Eqs.(16),  the  linearity  of  transformation  between  two  {xr
m,tm},  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative
velocities between two {xr
m,tm} will lead to the localized Lorentz transformation between two usual inertial
coordinate systems {xr
m,tm}, m=1,2, where the space and time differentials take places of the space and time
variables in the Lorentz transformation.

In  the  modified  special  relativity  theory,  the  c’-type  Galilean  transformation  stands  between  any
two  primed  inertial  coordinate  systems,  while  the  localized  Lorentz  transformation  between  two
corresponding  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems.  Substituting  the  assumption  Eqs.(11)  for  the  assumption
Eqs.(1)  does  not  spoil  the  localized  Lorentz  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate
systems and the local Lorentz invariance in the usual inertial coordinate systems.

VII. PHYSICAL PRINCIPLE IN THE MODIFIED SPECIAL RELATIVITY THEORY

As said, experiments clearly support the existence of the constancy of the one-way light speed c,
the Einstein law governing additions of usual velocities, and the local Lorentz invariance. These facts not
only  verify  the  postulates  (i)  and  (ii)  but  also  tell  us  that  it  is  the  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-
synchronized clock” measurement method which we use in our experiments. All our experimental data are
collected and expressed in the usual inertial coordinate system.

The  physical  principle  in  the  special  theory  of  relativity  is  the  Lorentz  invariance:  In  the  usual
inertial coordinate system, all physical laws keep their forms with respect to the Lorentz transformation. In
the modified special relativity theory, we may also chose the usual inertial coordinate system for theoretical
purposes. The physical principle is the local Lorentz invariance: In the usual inertial coordinate system, all
physical  laws  keep  their  forms  with  respect  to  the  localized  Lorentz  transformation.  This  local  Lorentz
invariance  must  be  implemented  in  dealing  with  the  non-flat  structures  Eqs.(11).  The  modified  special
relativity theory, however, offers another choice: the primed inertial coordinate system. Taking this choice,
we have a new physical principle: The c’-type Galilean invariance in the primed inertial coordinate system
plus the transformation from the primed inertial coordinate system to the usual inertial coordinate system. In
the primed inertial coordinate system, we write all physical laws in the c’-type Galilean-invariant form, we
do  calculations  in  the  c’-type  Galilean-invariant  manner,  and  we  finally  transform  all  results  from  the
primed inertial coordinate system to the usual inertial coordinate system and compare them to experimental
facts in the usual inertial coordinate system.

The transformation from the primed to the usual inertial coordinate systems is an important part of
the new physical principle. If two axes x’r and xr, where r runs 1,2,3, are set to have the same direction and
the same origin, the transformation is
dx’r=K(y)dxr, r=1,2,3,
dt’=(1-y2/c2)1/2dt .

(17a)
(17b)

This transformation links the Galilean transformation between any two primed inertial coordinate systems
up with the localized Lorentz transformation between two corresponding usual inertial coordinate systems
[24].

VIII. MECHANICS AND FIELD THEORY AND QUANTUM FIELD THEORY

The  new  physical  principle  has  been  applied  to  reform  of  mechanics  and  field  theory  [24].  The
validity  of  relativistic  mechanics  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  remains,  while  field  theory  is
freshened. In the usual inertial coordinate system, interaction-free field equations contain non-flat structures
grs(y)  and  g(y).  These  equations  still  have  the  de  Broglie  wave  solution.  In  the  usual  inertial  coordinate
system, the canonically conjugate variables to field variables j k (vector or spinor) are

and dx’=dx’1dx’2dx’3. The conserved field energy and momentum, 

jdx’, j=1,2,3,4, form a vector as

well as T4
j because dx’ is invariant. The gauging procedure adopted in the current field theory  to  make  a
field  system  locally  gauge-invariant  with  respect  to  a  certain  gauge  group  is  still  effective  in  the  primed
inertial  coordinate  system.  As  we  act  the  transformation  from  the  primed  to  the  usual  inertial  coordinate
systems on this procedure, we can find its version in the usual inertial coordinate system. Moreover, it is the
most  remarkable  feature  of  the  freshened  field  theory  that  the  concept  of  particle  size  has  its  own  room.
Particle  size  defined  in  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  is  an  invariant  quantity.  It  can  be  quite
involved in our invariant calculations, though the concept of particle size in the primed inertial coordinate
system is different from that we tried but failed to introduce in the current Lorentz-invariant field theory.
We discuss it in detail elsewhere.

In the primed inertial coordinate system, any field system can be quantized by use of the canonical
quantization  method.  As  instantaneity  is  a  covariant  concept,  the  equal-time  commutation  or  anti-
commutation  relations  are  reasonable.  As  the  canonically  conjugate  variables  are  contravariant  to  the
original field variables, the commutation or anti-commutation relations are also of tensor equations. As the
light speed c’ is infinite, the essentially instantaneous quantum connection is acceptable. As the primed time
differential dt’ is invariant in all inertial frames of reference, the time-ordered product  in  the  perturbation
expansion of S-matrix is definite.

In regard to question: How is a quantized field system transformed under the transformation from
the primed to the usual inertial coordinate systems, there is a transformation law which has been established.
The  transformation  law  says:  Any  quantized  field  system  will  undergo  a  unitary  transformation  as  it  is
transformed from the primed inertial coordinate system to the usual inertial coordinate systems [24].

IX. RESOLUTION OF THE DIVERGENCE PROBLEM

The divergence difficulties in the current quantum field theory have been already ascribed to the
model of point particle. But, in the framework of the special relativity theory, all attempts to assign a finite
size to a particle failed. According to the special relativity theory, particle size is not a covariant concept. It
has been unknown how to carry out the Lorentz-invariant calculations  based  on  such  a  size.  The  Lorentz
invariance  recognizes  the  light  speed  c  constituting  a  limitation  for  transport  of  matter  or  energy  and
transmission of information or causal connection. The law of causality rejects any instantaneous processes
between two events at distinct space points. It is very hard to explain how a sized particle as a whole is set
in  motion  when  a  force  acts  on  it  at  its  edge.  It  is  very  hard  to  explain  how  the  quantum  connection
specified by the quantum mechanics theory can be instantaneous. Also, as pointed out by Poincare [25], the
field  energy  and  momentum  of  a  sized  electron,  in  the  framework  of  the  special  relativity  theory,  do  not
have correct transformation properties, unlike its mechanical energy and momentum, though they are finite.
That  will  result  in  different  values  when  we  compute  some  quantities,  f.g.  the  total  mass  of  the  sized
electron.

All of these alter in the modified special relativity theory. In the primed inertial coordinate system,
particle  size  is  a  covariant  concept;  the  light  speed  constituting  a  limitation  for  the  matter  or  energy
transport  and  the  information  or  causal  connection  transmission  is  c’,  infinite;  the  field  energy  and
momentum of a sized particle form a vector, as well as its mechanical energy and momentum. In the primed
inertial  coordinate  system,  all  particles  properly  exhibit  their  size.  As  a  matter  of  course,  we  have  a
convergent and c’-type Galilean-invariant quantum field theory for any quantized field system in the primed
inertial  coordinate  system.  When  we  perform  the  transformation  from  the  primed  to  the  usual  inertial
coordinate  systems,  the  unitary  transformation  does  not  change  the  eigenvalue  spectrums  of  operators  of
this  quantized  field  system,  the  expectation  values  of  its  observations,  and  its  operator  and  state  vector

7

equations. We hence have a convergent and invariant quantum field theory for the quantized field system in
the usual inertial coordinate system. Since it is the localized Lorentz transformation that stands between any
two usual inertial coordinate systems, we indeed have a convergent and locally Lorentz-invariant quantum
field theory for the quantized field system in the usual inertial coordinate system.

in  the  usual  velocity-coordinates  {yr},  r=1,2,3.  In  fact,  with  standard  calculation  techniques  in  Riemann
geometry, one can derive Eq.(20) from Eqs.(21). This velocity-space is characterized by the finite velocity
boundary  c  and  the  Einstein  velocity  addition  law  [18,23].  Non-flat  generalized  Finslerian  structures  of
gravity-free space and time in the usual inertial coordinate system match this Riemannian structure of the
velocity-space in the usual velocity-coordinates {yr}, r=1,2,3.

We can re-defined this velocity-space in the primed velocity-coordinates {y’r}, r=1,2,3, by

In  the  modified  special  relativity  theory,  P(y1,y2,y3)  and  P(y)  are  the  velocity  and  velocity  rate
distributions of free particles in the usual velocity-coordinates {yr}, r=1,2,3. They reduce to the Maxwellian
distributions only in the part of y small enough. It is a characteristic that P(y1,y2,y3) and P(y) go to zero as y
approaches c as well as y approaches zero. The detection of velocity and velocity rate distributions for free
particles  in  the  molecular  or  atom  or  electron  beam  experiments  can  serve  as  the  tests  to  investigate  the
local  structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time.  It  might  provide  an  evidence  for  the  modified  special
relativity theory.

XII. CONCLUDING REMARKS

There exists an equivalence class of the inertial frames of reference, any one of which moves with
a non-zero constant velocity relative to any other. Each of the inertial frames of reference is supplied with
motionless, rigid unit rods of equal length and motionless, synchronized clocks of equal running rate. Each
inertial  frame  of  reference  can  set  up  its  own  at  least  two  distinct  inertial  coordinate  systems,  the  usual
inertial coordinate system and the primed inertial coordinate system.

The  special  theory  of  relativity  is  formed  by  combining  the  two  postulates  (I)  and  (ii)  and  the
assumption  that  gravity-free  space  and  time  possess  the  flat  structures  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate
system. The modified special relativity theory is formed by combining the two postulates (I) and (ii) and the
alternative  assumption  that  gravity-free  space  and  time  possess  the  flat  structures  in  the  primed  inertial
coordinate system and their generalized Finslerian structures in the usual inertial coordinate system. Both
the special relativity theory and the modified special relativity theory involve the local Lorentz invariance in
the  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems  and  the  constancy  of  the  one-way  speed  of  light.  But  the  modified
special relativity theory involves more. It owns a new version of the light speed, infinite primed speed c’ in
the  primed  inertial  coordinate  systems.  In  turn,  the  modified  special  relativity  theory  has  a  new  physical
principle: the c’-type Galilean invariance in the primed inertial coordinate  system  plus  the  transformation
from the primed inertial coordinate system to the usual inertial coordinate system.

In the framework of the modified special relativity theory, relativistic mechanics is still valid in the
usual inertial coordinate system, while field theory is freshened. Especially, the modified special relativity
theory and the quantum mechanics theory together found a convergent and invariant quantum field theory.

In the modified special relativity theory, the velocity-space can be defined in two different ways, in
the  usual  velocity-coordinates  {yr},  r=1,2,3,  and  in  the  primed  velocity-coordinates  {y’r},  r=1,2,3.  This
characteristic  is  absent  in  the  special  relativity  theory.  This  characteristic  leads  us  to  corrections  to  the
Maxwellian velocity and velocity rate  distributions  of  free  particles.  These  corrections  have  experimental
means of testing the local structures of gravity-free space and time.

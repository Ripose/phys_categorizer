Abstract

RFQ with a harmonic higher order quadrupole mode is
studied. Assuming that we superpose a higher order mode
with  twice  the  frequency  of  the  fundamental  mode,  a
sawtooth waveform is approximated. In such a case, the
bunching  function  is  enhanced  while  the  transverse
stability is modified. Second order longitudinal harmonic
component is also required to enable the effect.

1  INTRODUCTION

Some  bunchers  use  sawtooth  wave  forms  for  better
bunching factor. Application of such sawtooth wave form
to an RFQ may shorten a length of RFQ. Because of the
orthogonality  of  the  trigonometric  functions,  we  also
have to introduce a longitudinal harmonics. Energy gain
in  a  period  is  described  in  the  next  section.  Section  3
shows a potential function generating such electric field
and an example of its vane shape. RF defocusing factor is
calculated  in  section  4.  The  transverse  stability  is
discussed in section 5. Rough resonator examples can be
seen in section 6.

Let us assume that the electric field Ez on a beam axis

where  w   is  angular  frequency  of  RF  and  k=p /Lc.  The
second  terms  of  time  and  spatial  harmonics  are  newly
introduced in addition to the two term potential function
[1,2].  The  energy  gain  d T  for  an  ion  with  relationship
w t=kz is obtained by integrating Eq.(1) from z=0 to 2Lc :

d T = q

where  q   is  the  charge  of  the  ion.  Because  of  the
orthogonality, we need a condition i=j for the harmonics
effect.  In  order  to  enhance  the  bunching  function  in  an
RFQ, a condition i=j=2 will be taken. It should be noted
that the range of the integration is twice the range of the
conventional  RFQ  case.  Thus,  the  energy  gain  in  the
period is:

In order to approximate the sawtooth function, f 2-p z2 and
A20H2 have to be -p /4  and  1/4,  respectively.  Figure  1
shows the resulted energy gain as a function of f .

second order term, x and y vanes are not symmetric. It can
be seen that y-vane is separated at z=0 and z=3Lc, which
should not be harmful in this particular case, because of
the  small  distance.  The  condition  A20H 2=1/4  implies
H2=1. Figure 3a shows the time dependent term of Eq.(1).
Figure  3b  shows  the  corresponding  longitudinal
distribution.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  peak  value  is
higher than the single sine wave, which will be discussed
later.  Larger  A 20  term  in  short  Lc  region  makes  the
contour lines complex, which means that the A20 cannot
be large at such region. As shown in Fig.2, the vane tip
position  sa at (y,z)=(0,0), is modified from the original
value a by the A20 term. A20 is plotted as functions of the
coefficients  at  m=1.1,  Lc/r0=1.1,1,2,  and  1.5  in  Fig.  4,
where m is the commonly used modulation parameter.

order  mode. Because of the extra force term, the focusing
strength increases with A20 for constant amplitude of the
fundamental mode.

6  CAVITY  EXAMPLE

Figure 7 shows an example of the harmonic cavity for a
four-vane DFQ. The right lower half of the figure shows
the fundamental mode and the left upper one shows the
second order mode. This particular example exhibits rather
small shunt impedance (less than half) compared with that
of a conventional single-mode-RFQ[3]. Figure 8 shows
another example for four-rod-DFQ that has the frequencies
of  143  and  290MHz.  These  are  shown  only  for  the
possibility  of  the  harmonic  resonators,  where  the
geometries are not fully optimized.

The equivalent circuit for such resonators is shown in

Fig. 9. Using following notations:

One  more  scheme  is  to  apply  fundamental  RF  to
horizontal electrodes and to apply second order mode to
another ones. This scheme is under investigation.

7 DISCUSSION

Lc/r0 at an entrance is large for a low frequency RFQ (as
used for heavy ions), which allows larger A20 value. The
sparking  issue  in  the  superposed  RF  wave  form  is  not
clear, but seems easier for lower frequencies [4,5,6].

The  complex  vane  shapes  may  be  approximated  by
trapezoids,  because  only  the  longitudinal  higher  order
mode having the corresponding RF mode can affect the
longitudinal  motion.  The  transverse  motion  will  not  be
changed  much  as  long  as  the  quadrupole  component  is
preserved.  This  can  be  extended  to  an  IH-DTL  (inter-
digital H type) with electro-focusing fingers, where the
gap centers shift alternatively.

Because of the wide stability region in the synchrotron
oscillation, the synchronous phase may be at 0° or more,
which makes the accelerator section short. The RF power
consumption is just a sum of that for each mode, in spite
of the high peak field. Because two additional parameters
are  added  (phase  and  amplitude  for  the  second  RF),
focusing characteristics may be adjusted independently. If
z-dependence  in  the  quadrupole  field  is  added,  more
focusing force may be available with penalty of multipole
effects.  The  determination  of  the  cell  parameters  is
complex  compared  with  the  conventional  RFQ.  The
multiple RF feed technique is to be established[7].

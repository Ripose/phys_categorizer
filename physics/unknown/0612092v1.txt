Abstract 

A  model  is  presented  for  predicting  the  capture  of  magnetic  micro/nano-particles  in  a 

bioseparation microsystem. This bioseparator consists of an array of conductive elements 

embedded  beneath  a  rectangular  microfluidic  channel.  The  magnetic  particles  are 

introduced into the microchannel in solution, and are attracted and held by the magnetic 

force  produced  by  the  energized  elements.    Analytical  expressions  are  obtained  for  the 

dominant  magnetic  and  fluidic  forces  on  the  particles  as  they  move  through  the 

microchannel.  These  expressions  are  included  in  the  equations  of  motion,  which  are 

solved numerically to predict particle trajectories and capture time.  This model is well-

suited for parametric analysis of particle capture taking into account variations in particle 

size, material properties, applied current, microchannel dimensions, fluid properties, and

1. Introduction 

 

In  molecular  biology  the  ability  to  separate  biomaterials  such  as  cells,  enzymes, 

antigens,  or  DNA  from  their  native  environment  is  fundamental  to  the  detection  and 

analysis of such entities (Pankhurst et al., 2003; Molday et al., 1977). Broadly speaking, 

the  primary  function  of  a  bioseparator  is  to  separate  a  target  biomaterial  from  a  low 

concentration  solution,  and  re-release  it  in  sufficiently  high  concentration  to  enable  a 

desired  analysis.  Magnetic  bioseparation  is  a  versatile  and  well-established  method  to 

achieve this. It involves the use of magnetic micro/nano-particles with surface treatments 

(immobilized affinity ligand) that are designed to bind with a target biomaterial.  

Magnetic  separation  is  usually  implemented  using  either  a  direct  or  indirect 

approach (Safarýk and Safarýkova, 1977). In the more common direct approach surface-

treated particles are mixed with a solution containing the target biomaterial. The mixture 

is  allowed  to  incubate  until  a  sufficient  amount  of  biomaterial  binds  to  the  particles 

(bound biomaterial is said to be magnetically tagged or labeled). The labeled biomaterial 

is separated from the solution using a magnetic separation system, and then re-released in 

higher concentration for further processing.   

In the indirect approach, the target biomaterial is first incubated in solution with 

an  affinity  ligand  (primary  antibody),  which  is  added  in  free  form.  After  a  sufficient 

amount  of  biomaterial  binds  to  the  primary  antibody,  magnetic  particles  with  surface-

bound  secondary  antibodies  (antibodies  against  the  primary  antibodies)  are  introduced, 

and the mixture is allowed to incubate until a sufficient amount of the target biomaterial 

becomes  magnetically  tagged.  This  material  is  then  separated  and  re-released  in  higher 

concentration for further processing.     

The use of magnetic separation in molecular biology has enjoyed a resurgence of 

interest over the last decade (Zborowski et al., 1995). It has advantages over competing 

techniques  in  that  it  is  significantly  faster  than  other  methods,  and  enables  the  target 

biomaterial to be isolated directly from crude samples such as blood, bone marrow, and 

tissue homogenates. Furthermore, the relatively low permeability of the aqueous medium 

enables efficient coupling between the applied field and the magnetically labeled material. 

Moreover, since biomaterials have a relatively low intrinsic magnetic susceptibility, there 

is  substantial  contrast  between  tagged  and  untagged  material,  which  enables  a  high 

degree of selectivity.  

In 

conventional  magnetic 

separation 

systems 

rare-earth  magnets  or 

electromagnets  are  used  to  produce  a  non-uniform  field  distribution  throughout  the 

separation region. When magnetic particles enter this region they experience a force that 

moves  them  towards  areas  of  high  field  gradient  where  they  can  be  captured.  The 

particles have a high susceptibility and acquire a dipole moment in an external field, but 

quickly relax back to an unmagnetized state once the field is removed.  Thus, when the 

field  is  removed  the  separated  particles  re-disperse  in  solution,  thereby  enabling  the 

primary function of the separator, the enhancement of  target material concentration.  

Conventional magnetic separation systems have drawbacks in that they tend to be 

relatively large, costly, and complex, requiring significant energy to operate. Moreover, 

the accurate manipulation of microscopic particles in small sample volumes is awkward 

and time consuming in such systems, and the ability to precisely monitor the separation 

process 

is 

limited. 

However,  advances  in 

microsystem  technology 

have 

led 

to 

the 

development  of  novel 

integrated 

magnetic 

bioseparation 

microsystems 

that  are 

energy 

efficient 

and 

ideal  for  the  analysis 

and monitoring of small 

samples 

(Gijs,  2004, 

Han et al., 2004).  Such

a system has been fabricated and characterized by Choi (Choi et al., 2000, 2001).  This 

microsystem  consists  of  a  parallel  array  of  rectangular  conductive  elements,  which  are 

semi-encapsulated  in  permalloy  (not  shown),  and  embedded  beneath  a  rectangular 

microfluidic channel (Fig. 1A). The microsystem is small, occupying a volume of only a 

few cubic millimeters.   

A hypothetical separation sequence for this system is depicted in a cross-sectional 

view  in  Fig.  1B.  First,  magnetic  particles  with  surface-bound  antibodies  enter  the 

microchannel  and  are  captured  by  the  energized  conductive  elements.  Next,  target 

antigens are introduced into the microchannel and bind to the antibodies on the captured 

particles,  thereby  becoming  immobilized.  Lastly,  the  conductive  elements  are  de-

energized  and  the  separated  material  is  re-released  in  high  concentration  for  further 

processing.      

In  this  article  we  develop  a  model  for  predicting  the  transport  and  capture  of 

magnetic  particles  in  a  bioseparation  microsystem  similar  to  that  developed  by  Choi 

(Choi  et  al.,  2000,  2001).   We  obtain  analytical  expressions  for  the  dominant  magnetic 

and  fluidic  forces  on  the  particles,  and  test  the  magnetic  force  expression  using  finite 

element analysis (FEA). We include the magnetic, fluidic, and gravitational forces in the 

equations of particle motion, and solve these equations to study particle movement within 

the  bioseparator.  Specifically,  we  compute  particle  trajectories  and  capture  times,  and 

show  that  efficient  separation  can  be  achieved  in  a  few  minutes  with  modest  power 

dissipation. The model takes into account key variables including the size and magnetic 

properties  of  the  particles,  the  dimensions  and  spacing  of  the  conductive  elements,  the 

magnitude of the applied current, the dimensions of the microchannel, and the viscosity 

and flow rate of the fluid. An important advantage of this approach is that it is based on 

analytical  analysis,  which  provides  insight  into  the  basic  physics  and  dominant  factors 

governing particle capture, and enables rapid parametric analysis of system performance. 

This is in contrast to a purely numerical approach (e.g., finite-element analysis) that tends 

to  be  awkward  for  parametric  analysis.  The  model  is  demonstrated  via  application  to  a 

practical microsystem design, and our analysis indicates that efficient particle capture can 

be achieved in a few minutes.

microfluidic bioseparator shown in Fig. 1.  The trajectory of the particle is governed by 

several forces including, (a) the magnetic force due to all field sources, (b) fluidic drag, 

(c) particle/fluid interactions (perturbations to the flow field),  (d) inertia, (e) buoyancy,  

(f)  gravity,  (g)  thermal  kinetics  (Brownian  motion),  and  (h)  interparticle  effects  that 

include  magnetic  dipole  interactions.  We  are  interested  in  the  behavior  of  magnetic 

particles  in  low  concentration  and  slow  flow  regimes  where  the  magnetic  and  viscous 

drag  forces  dominate.  Therefore,  we  neglect  particle/fluid  interactions  and  interparticle 

effects. However, we include the gravitational force, which while of second order relative 

to the dominant forces, is not negligible. We use classical Newtonian dynamics to study 

particle motion,

dipole  moment  approach  where  the  magnetized  particle  is  replaced  by  an  “equivalent” 

point dipole with a moment 

p,effm  (Furlani and Ng, 2006). The force on the dipole (and

where η and 

fv  are  the  viscosity  and  the  velocity  of  the  fluid,  respectively.  For  the 

bioseparation  applications  of  interest  here,  the  flow  in  the  microchannel  can  be 

considered to be laminar with a velocity profile that varies in a parabolic fashion along 

the  height  of  the  channel.  Since  the  particle  diameter  is  much  smaller  than  the  channel 

height, the fluid velocity is relatively constant across the particle. As such, we use Eq. (3) 

to estimate the drag force at a given time using the particle velocity at that time, and the 

fluid velocity at the position of the particle at that time. It should be noted that a rigorous 

analysis of the fluidic force for this application is complicated and beyond the scope of 

      The gravitational force is given by  

this study.

 is  the  acceleration  due  to  gravity.    The  gravitation  force  acts  in  the  -y

direction. It is worth noting that the gravitational force is often ignored when analyzing 

the magnetophoretic motion of submicron particles, as it is usually much weaker than the 

magnetic force (Furlani, 2006; Furlani and Sahoo, 2006). However, in this application the 

magnetic  force  is  relatively  weak  and  the  particles  can  be  micron-sized.  Therefore,  we 

include the gravitational force in the analysis.  

We digress briefly to discuss the limitations of the Newtonian approach. As noted 

above, Eq. (1) does not take into account Brownian motion, which can influence particle 

capture when the particle diameter 

pD is sufficiently small. Gerber et al. have developed 

the following criterion to estimate this diameter (Gerber et al., 1983)  

 

pF D kT≤

, 

(5) 

where  F  is  the  magnitude  of  the  total  force  acting  on  the  particle,  k  is  the  Boltzmann 

constant,  and  T  is  the  absolute  temperature.  In  order  to  apply  Eq.  (5),  one  needs  to 

estimate  F .  If  the  magnetic  field  source  is  specified,  one  can  estimate  F  for  a  given 

particle by taking a spatial average of the force on the particle over the region of interest. 

Gerber et al. have studied the capture of Fe3O4 particles in water using a single magnetic 

wire,  and  have  estimated  the  critical  particle  diameter  for  their  application  to 

be

the  trajectory  of  a  single  particle.  Specifically,

In order to solve either Newton’s equation (1) or the advection-diffusion equation (7), one

2.1. Magnetic Force 
 

Consider  a  spherical  magnetic  particle  in  the  presence  of  an  applied  magnetic 

field 

aH . Assume that particle is uniformly magnetized, and that the magnetization is a 

linear function of the field intensity up to saturation, at which point it remains constant at 

a value Ms . Specifically, below saturation,

 for a uniformly polarized spherical particle with magnetization  M  in free-

space (Furlani, 2001).   

If the particle is suspended in a magnetically linear fluid of permeability

Eqs. (19) and (20) are given by Binns  (Binns et al., 1992), but the expression there for 

Eq. (20) is missing a minus sign, which has been corrected here. We substitute Eqs. (19) 

and (20) into Eqs. (16) and (17), and obtain the magnetic force components for a single

Next,  consider  an  array  of  Nc  conductors  with  the  fist  conductor  centered  with 

respect to the origin in the x-y plane, and all other conductors positioned along the x-axis 

as shown in Fig. 2B. The direction of current is opposite in adjacent conductors, i.e., into 

the page and then out of the page as shown.  We identify the conductors using the index n 

= (0,1,2,3,4, …, Nc-1). The field components due to the first conductor (n = 0) are given 

by Eqs. (19) and (20). The n’th conductor is centered at 

x

 and its field components 

s=

can be written in terms of Eqs. (19) and (20) as follows,

Equations (29) and (30) are used in the equations of motion below.  
 

2.2. Fluidic Force 

As  noted  above,  we  use  Stokes’  law  to  predict  the  fluidic  drag  force  on  the 

particle. Specifically, to obtain the drag force at a given time t, we substitute the particle 

velocity at that time 

v

p (t)

, and the fluid velocity at the position of the particle at that time 

v x
p(
f

(t))

, into Eq. (3),

(31) 

To evaluate Eq. (31) we need an expression for fluid velocity 

fv  in the microchannel. Let 

L denote the length of the channel and 

ch and 

cw denote the half-height and half-width of 

its rectangular cross section (Fig. 1A). The nature of the flow, laminar or turbulent, is 

estimated from the Reynolds number 

Re

=

v

f

/Dρ η

, where 

fv  is the average fluid 

velocity , D is the characteristic length of the channel (the hydraulic diameter), and ρ 

and η are the density and viscosity of the fluid, respectively. In bioseparation 

applications 

fv  < 1 m/s, D ≈ 100 µm, 

ρ≈

1000 kg/m

, and 

η≈

0.001 Ns/m

. Therefore,

Re 100

 which indicates laminar flow (i.e.,  Re 2300

<

). We assume fully developed 

laminar flow with the flow velocity parallel to the x-axis, and varying across the cross 

section,

It is convenient to use coordinates  y′  and  z′  centered with respect to the cross section of 

the channel, and it is understood that these differ from the coordinate system used for the 

magnetic analysis (Fig. 2B).  Here, 

'z  spans the width of the channel. The velocity profile 

for fully developed laminar flow is

Equations  (39)  -  (41)  constitute  a  coupled  system  of  first-order  ordinary  differential 

equations  (ODEs)  that  are  solved  subject  to  initial  conditions  for  the  position

of  the  particle.  We  solve  these  equations 

numerically using the Runge Kutta method.  

Equations (39) - (41) predict the motion of a magnetic particle in a moving fluid 

that is permeated by a magnetic field. This applies to bioseparation in which the bound 

biomaterial is much smaller than the magnetic particle and does not appreciably influence 

particle  motion.      However,  in  many  applications  the  biomaterial  is  much  larger  than  a 

single particle. Some nominal sizes for various biomaterial are as follows (Pankhurst et al, 

2003):  cells  (10-100µm),  viruses  (20-450  nm),  proteins  (3-50  nm),  and  genes  (10  nm 

wide and 10-100 nm long). Thus, for example, if a cell is 20 microns in diameter, several 

micron-sized  magnetic  particles  must  bind  to  its  surface  to  implement  effective 

separation. If there are Np magnetic particles bound to a cell, the mass, volume, radius, 

and  density  of  the  combined  cell/particle  structure  can  be  estimated  using  (Safarýk  and 

Safarýkova, 1977)

The equations of motion (39) - (41) need to be modified to account these relationships.  

To simplify the analysis, we assume that that the magnetic force acts only on the bound 

magnetic  particles,  whereas  the  fluidic  force  acts  on  the  entire  structure,  which  to  first 

order  has  an  effective  radius

In this analysis, we have assumed that the cell/particle structure is rigid, and have ignored 

its rotation. A more complete analysis would include the effects of rotation and structural 

deformation, as well as the influence of motion on the local fluid flow (i.e. the coupled 

structure/fluid  interaction).    However,  these  effects  are  beyond  the  scope  of  the  present 

work.  

3. Results 
 

We use Eqs. (27)-(30) and (39)-(41) to study the bioseparator shown in Fig. 1A. 

We  assume  that  the  transport  fluid  is  nonmagnetic  (

0χ = ),  and  has  a  viscosity  and 

f

density  equal  to  that  of  water, 

η=

0.001

 Ns/m2  and 

fρ =  1000  kg/m3.  The  force 

calculation  requires  a  choice  of  particle  size  and  material  properties.  We  choose  a 

commercially  available  particle  that  is  commonly  used  for  bioapplications,  the  MyOne 

particle  from  Dynal  Biotech  (www.dynabead.com).  The  properties  of  this  particle  as 

obtained  from  Dynal  Biotech  are  as  follows:  radius 

pR =  0.5  µm,  density 

ρ =p

 and  saturation  magnetization

 The 

intrinsic 

susceptibility 

pχ  is  not  available.  Instead,  Dynal  Biotech  specifies  an  “effective” 

susceptibility  of

χ =

.  The  values  of 

pχ  and 

p,eχ  are  measured  with  respect  to  the 

internal  and  applied  field,  respectively,  and  for  a  given  sample  the  two  are  related  as

where N is the shape dependent demagnetization factor of the sample (e.g., N = 1/3 for a 

sphere).  We  modify  our  model  and  use 

p,eχ  instead of 

pχ ,  which  amounts  to  replacing

It  is  important  to  note  that  commercial  particles  such  as  the  MyOne  are  typically 

composites  of  magnetic  and  polymeric  materials  with  properties  that  are  fabrication 

specific, and significantly different than those of the constituent magnetic material, e.g., 

Fe3O4  (magnetite).  Specifically,  Fe3O4  has  a  density 

ρ=

5000 kg/m

 and  a  saturation

 both  of  which  are  substantially  higher  than  the 

corresponding MyOne values. A magnetization model for Fe3O4 suitable for bioseparator 

analysis can be found in the literature (Furlani, 2006; Furlani and Ng, 2006 ).   

      We  first  compute  the  field  and  force  on  a  MyOne  particle  due  to  an  array  of  three 

equally spaced conductive elements.  We use a reference frame centered with respect to 

the first element, and assign dimensions: w = 50 µm and h = 25 µm (the total width and 

height  of  the  element  are  100  µm  and  50  µm,  respectively).  Each  element  carries  a 

current of  I = 450 mA, which corresponds to a current density of 

J

= ×

9 10  A/m .

 The  

direction of current alternates from element to element as shown in Figs. 3c and 4c. The 

first  element  is  centered  at  the  origin  of  the  x-y  plane  with  its  current  directed  into  the 

page,  and  the  elements  are  spaced  100  µm  apart  (edge  to  edge).  The  field  and  force 

components are evaluated along a horizontal line  2

 at y = h +10 µm (10 µm 

above the top of the elements), and are  shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively, along with

corresponding data obtained using finite element analysis (FEA). The FEMLAB program 

from COMSOL was used for the FEA. Note that Bx peaks at the center of each element, 

but  alternates  in  sign  from  one  element  to  the  next  due  to  the  alternating  current.  The 

components By , Fmx and Fmy peak near the edges.  

 Next,  we  study  the 

fluidic force on the particle. 

The 

total  height  of 

the 

microchannel  is  set  to  100 

µm    (

50  mµ=ch

),  and  we 

assume  that  the  average 

fluid 

velocity 

is 

fv

=

0.1 mm/s.

 We  use  Eq.  

(37)  and  compute 

fxF along 

a 

vertical 

line

that spans the height of the microchannel.

h

h

h
2 c

 (i.e., from the bottom to the top of the channel,

0=bt

 in this analysis). The 

force  profile,  which  is  plotted  in  Fig.  5,  has  a  parabolic  shape  with  a  maximum  of 

approximately 

fxF = 1.4 pN midway in the channel and two minima of zero at either edge. 

Thus,  the  magnetic  force  at  the  top  of  a  conductive  element  (near  its  edge)  will  hold  a 

particle  in  place  once  it  reaches  the  bottom  of  the  channel,  as  the  fluidic  force  is 

essentially zero there. 

We  now  study  the  dynamics  of  an  isolated  particle  as  it  moves  through  the 

bioseparator.  Again, the total height of the microchannel is 100 µm, and we assume that 

there  is  an  array  of  40  identical  conductive  elements  immediately  beneath  its  base 

(

0=bt

). Each element has dimensions w = 50 µm and h = 25 µm and carries a current I = 

450 mA, which alternates in direction from one element to the next as shown in Fig. 1A. 

The  elements  are  spaced  100  µm  apart  (edge  to  edge).  As  above,  we  use  a  reference 

frame  centered  with  respect  to  the  first  element,  and  therefore  the  last  element  of  the 

array ends at x = 7850 µm. We examine the trajectory of the particle as a function of its 

vertical entry point into the bioseparator. Specifically, we assume that the particle enters 

to the left of the first element at 

x

(0)

w= −
5

, and compute its trajectory as a function of 

its  initial  height  above  the  conductive  elements:  ∆y  =  10  µm,  20  µm,  …,  90  µm  (i.e., 

initial  heights  of  y(0)  =  35  µm,  45  µm,  …,  115  µm).  The  average  fluid  velocity  is

 The computed particle trajectories are shown in Fig. 6. It is easy to 

identify each trajectory with the corresponding entry height into the microchannel, as this 

height is the starting point of the trajectory on the y-axis.  For this analysis we integrated 

Eqs. (39) and (40) using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, and it took less than one 

minute to complete the simulation. The results indicate that the bioseparator will capture 

particles that enter the microchannel 0-80 µm above the conductive elements. However, 

if its entry point is higher than this, a particle will pass through the microchannel (beyond 

the array which ends at x = 7850 µm). Note that the trajectory plots are slightly irregular 

because  the  x-component  of  the  magnetic  force  reverses  sign  each  time  the  particle 

passes  over  a  conductive  element  as  shown  in  Fig.  4a.  Thus,  the  particle  experiences 

acceleration followed by deceleration as it passes over an element, which gives rise to the 

irregular plots.  

The 

capture 

time,  i.e.,  the  time  it 

takes  for  the  particle 

to reach the bottom of 

the 

microchannel 

where  it  will  be  held 

in  place,  is  plotted  as 

a 

function  of 

the 

entry height in Fig. 7. 

 
Fig. 7. Capture time vs. initial entry height above conductive elements. 

Particles  that  enter  the  microchannel  0-80  µm  above  the  conductive  elements  will  be 

captured within 70 s.   

It  is  instructive  to  note  that  the  gravitational  force  (including  buoyancy)  on  a 

MyOne  particle  is 

gF =  0.0041  pN.  This  is  much  smaller  than  the  magnetic  force  myF = 

0.034 pN that it experiences 10 um above the edge of an element (Fig. 4b). Now, if 

gF  

were  the  only  force  acting  on  the  particle,  it  would  obtain  a  downward  vertical  drift 

velocity  of  0.435  µm/s,  which  follows  from  a  balance  between  the  gravitational  and 

fluidic  drag  force.  Thus,  it  would  take  161  seconds  for  a  MyOne  particle  to  reach  the 

bottom of the microchannel starting from a height of 70 µm above the elements. This is 

much longer than the 50 seconds it takes to travel the same distance under the combined 

influence  of  myF  and 

gF  (Fig.  7).  Thus,  the  magnetic  force  dominates  the  gravitational 

force.  However, 

gF  needs  to  be  included  in  the  analysis  because  its  contribution  to  the 

particle motion, while small, is not negligible.   

Lastly,  we  consider  the  power  dissipated  by  the  bioseparator.  If  the  conductive 

elements (which extend beyond the width of the microchannel) are 1 mm long and made 

of  copper  (

σ =

5.8 10
×

S/m),  then  each  element  will  have  a  resistance  of  3.45  mΩ.  A 

7

potential  difference  of  1.55  mV  must  be  applied  across  the  length  of  each  element  to 

produce the specified current of  I = 450 mA. If there are 40 elements, and if the elements 

are  electrically  connected  in  a  serpentine  fashion,  the  then  the  power  dissipated  by  the 

microsystem will be approximately 36.4 mW, wherein 28 mW will be dissipated in the 

elements, and 8.4 mW in the connectors. Here, we assume that the conductive elements 

extend  far  enough  beyond  the  microchannel  so  that  the  magnetic  field  due  to  the 

connectors does not appreciably alter the capture field. This is more of a design issue, but 

it is reasonable to assume that the connectors should be spaced from the microchannel a 

distance at least equal to the gap between neighboring elements.     

4. Conclusion 
 

We have presented a model for predicting particle capture in a magnetophoretic 

microfuidic bioseparator. The model is based on analytical analysis and is well-suited for 

rapid  parametric  studies  of  particle  trajectory  and  capture  time  as  a  function  of  key 

variables  including  the  size  and  properties  of  a  particle,  its  entry  point  into  the 

microfluidic system, the dimensions and spacing of the conductive elements, the applied 

current, the dimensions of the microchannel, and the viscosity and flow rate of the fluid. 

We have applied the model to a bioseparator design, and our results indicate that efficient 

particle  capture  can  be  achieved  within  a  few  minutes  with  only  modest  energy 

dissipation.

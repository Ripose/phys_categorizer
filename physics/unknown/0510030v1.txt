Applying Fermi’s nuclear reactor theory, I demonstrated the feasibility of planetocentric 
nuclear  fission  reactors,  which  offer  possible  explanations  for  the  internal  energy 
produced  by  Jupiter,  Saturn,  and  Neptune  (Herndon  1992),  for  the  energy  source  that 
powers the geomagnetic field (Herndon 1993; Herndon 1994), and, perhaps, for energy 
production associated with other planets and large moons in our Solar System. 
 
As  a  deep-Earth  energy  source,  the  planetocentric  nuclear-fission  georeactor  concept  is 
on a more secure scientific footing than the previous idea related to the assumed growth 
of  the  inner  core.  There  is  no  observational  support  for  the  idea  that  the  inner  core  is 
cooling  and  growing  (Herndon  2005),  and  no  legitimate  basis  for  believing  that  useful 
energy,  concomitantly  produced,  would  power  the  geomagnetic  field  instead  of  simply 
reducing the inner-core rate of cooling. In striking contrast, the close agreement between 
observed  deep-Earth  helium  isotope  ratios  and  georeactor-produced  helium  isotopes 
(Herndon  2003),  calculated  from  state-of-the-art  numerical  simulations  (Hollenbach  & 
Herndon  2001),  is  strong  evidence  for  the  existence  of  the  nuclear  georeactor.  Yet, 
despite  that,  some  would  –  by  omission  –  mislead  the  broad, general-interest, scientific 
community (Araki et al. 2005; McDonough 2005). At the foundations of science, science 
and ethical considerations are inseparable. 
 
Previously  envisioned  deep-Earth  energy  sources,  including  natural  radioactivity,  have 
one  characteristic  in  common:  Change  is  possible  only  gradually  and  in  only  one 
direction over time: On a human time-scale, that is essentially no change at all. Recently, 
Fogli et al. (2005) performed a likelihood analysis of the neutrino event spectra in energy 
and  time  using  monthly-binned  data  on  event-by-event  energies  in  KamLAND  and  on 
power  reactors  in  Japan.  In  making  their  calculations,  Fogli  et  al.  (2005)  assumed  that 
georeactor energy output is constant. Within the framework of present understanding, the 
assumption of constant georeactor output may or may not be valid.

The  purpose  of  this  brief  communication  is  to  emphasize  the  importance  of  scientific 
integrity and to highlight the possibility of variable georeactor power output so that these 
might be borne in mind in future investigations. Generally, variability in nuclear fission 
reactors  arises  from  changes  in  composition  and/or  position  of  fuel,  moderators,  and 
neutron  absorbers.  Although  as  yet  there  is  no  irrefutable  evidence  of  planetocentric 
nuclear reactor variability, circumstantial evidence certainly invites inquiry. 

In the late 1960s, astronomers discovered that Jupiter radiates into space approximately 
twice as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Later, Saturn and Neptune were also 
found to radiate prodigious quantities of internally generated energy. Stevenson (1978), 
discussing  Jupiter,  stated,  “The  implied  energy  source  ...  is  apparently  gravitational  in 
origin,  since  all  other  proposed  sources  (for  example,  radio-activity,  accretion, 
thermonuclear  fusion)  fall  short  by  at  least  two  orders  of  magnitude…”.  Similarly, 
Hubbard  (1990)  asserted,  “Therefore,  by  elimination,  only  one  process  could  be 
responsible for the luminosities of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. Energy is liberated when 
mass in a gravitationally bound object sinks closer to the center of attraction ... potential 
energy becomes kinetic energy ….” 

Having  knowledge  of  the  natural  reactors  at  Oklo,  I  realized  a  different  possibility  and 
proposed  the  idea  of  planetary-scale,  planetocentric  nuclear  fission  reactors  as  energy 
sources for the giant planets (Herndon 1992), demonstrating their feasibility in part using 
the  same  calculations  employed  in  the  design  of  commercial  nuclear  reactors  and 
employed  by  Kuroda  (1956)  to  predict  conditions  for  the  natural  reactors  that  were 
discovered in 1972 at Oklo, Republic of Gabon. 

The near-surface natural reactors at Oklo, which were critical about 1.8 billion years ago, 
operated intermittently (Maurette 1976). Recent investigations suggest quite rapid cycling 
periods  with  0.5  hour  of  operation  followed  by  2.5  hours  of  dormancy  (Meshik  et  al. 
2004).  While  the  specific  control  mechanism,  presumably  involving  water,  may  not  be 
directly  applicable  to  planetocentric  reactors,  the  observations  nevertheless  demonstrate 
the potential variability of natural nuclear reactors. 

Atmospheric turbulence in the giant planets appears to be driven by their internal energy 
sources. Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune produce prodigious amounts of energy and display 
prominent  turbulent  atmospheric  features.  Uranus,  on  the  other  hand,  radiates  little,  if 
any, internally generated energy and appears featureless. 
 
In the summer of 1878, Jupiter's Great Red Spot increased to a prominence never before 
recorded  and,  late  in  1882,  its  prominence,  darkness,  and  general  visibility  began 
declining  so  steadily  that  by  1890  astronomers  thought  that  the  Great  Red  Spot  was 
doomed to extinction. Changes have been observed in other Jovian features, including the 
formation of a new lateral belt of atmospheric turbulence (Peek 1958).

Jupiter, 98% of which consists of a mixture of H and He, excellent heat transfer media, is 
capable of rapid thermal transport. It is important to establish whether these atmospheric 
changes are due to changes in planetocentric nuclear reactor output as it seems, especially 
as these would represent short-period variability (Herndon 1994). 

Investigations  of  terrestrial  heat  flux  developed  under  the  assumption  of  essentially 
constant  heat  flow  produced  solely  by  long-lived,  natural  radioactive  decay.  That 
assumption  should  be  questioned  and  efforts  should  be  made  to  determine  whether 
variations can be resolved. 

Deep  within  the  Earth,  the  geomagnetic  field  varies  in  intensity  and  reverses  polarity 
frequently, but quite irregularly, with an average time between reversals of about 200,000 
years.  I  have  suggested  that  the  variable  and  intermittent  changes  in  the  intensity  and 
direction  of  the  geomagnetic  field  may  have  their  origin  in  nuclear  reactor  variability 
(Herndon 1993), but that has not yet been established. Ultimately, the nature and possible 
variability  of  deep-Earth  energy  production  can  be  revealed  by  making  fundamental 
discoveries and by discovering fundamental quantitative relationships in nature (Herndon 
2005); not by making blatant misrepresentations (Araki et al. 2005; McDonough 2005).

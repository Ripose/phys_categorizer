The  LEDA  RFQ,  a  350-MHz  continuous  wave  (CW)
radio-frequency 
successfully
accelerated a  100-mA  CW  proton  beam  from  75 keV  to
6.7 MeV. We have accumulated 111 hr of beam on time
with at least 90 mA of CW output beam current. The 8-m-
long  RFQ  accelerates  a  dc,  75–keV,  ~106-mA  H+  beam
from the LEDA injector  with ~94%  transmission.  When
operating the RFQ at the RF power level for which it was
designed,  the  peak  electrical  field  on  the  vane  tips  is
33 MV/m.  However,  to  maintain  the  high  transmission
quoted  above  with  the  CW  beam,  it  was  necessary  to
operate  the  RFQ  with  field  levels  ~10%  higher  than
design. The  RFQ  dissipates  1.5 MW  of  RF  power  when
operating  with  this  field.  Three  klystrons  provide  the
2.2 MW of RF power required by the RFQ to accelerate
the 100-mA beam. The beam power is 670 kW. Some of
the  challenges  that  were  met  in  accelerating  a  100-mA
CW proton beam to 6.7 MeV, will be discussed.

1  INTRODUCTION

The  LEDA  RFQ  [1,2]  (see  Figure  1)  is  the  highest
energy operational RFQ in the world [3-8]. Some of the
unique  features  implemented  in  this  RFQ  to  meet  this
goal include:

To  implement  the  reduced  focusing  strength  at  the
entrance  of  the  RFQ  and  have  adequate  focusing  in  the

It is over 9 wavelengths long, by far the longest
4-vane RFQ in the world.

•  The transverse focusing at the RFQ entrance was

reduced for easier beam injection.

•  An electron trap is placed between the final

focusing solenoid and the RFQ. The electron trap
prevents the electrons in the beam plasma from
flowing into the RFQ. With the electron trap turned
off electrons flowing into the RFQ reduced the
measured current as much as 25% from the correct
value.

•  The aperture and the gap voltage in the

acceleration section are larger than in previous
RFQ designs.

•  The transverse focusing at the RFQ exit is reduced

• 

to match the transverse focusing strength in the
coupled-cavity drift-tube linac [9].
It is the first RFQ to utilize resonant coupling
[10,11]. The RFQ is composed of four 2-m-long
RFQs resonantly coupled together. The RF fields
throughout its 8-m length are nearly as stable as the
fields in the 2-m-long RFQs from which it is
composed.

•  RF power from 3 klystrons is coupled to the RFQ

through 6 waveguide irises.

interior of the RFQ, the transverse focusing parameter is
increased smoothly from 3.1 to 7.0 over the first 32 cm of
the  RFQ.  The  focusing  parameter  is  proportional  to
2
where  V  is  the  voltage  between  adjacent  vane  tips
0/ rV
and  r0  is  the  average  aperture.  The  voltage  is  held
constant  in  this  region  and  the  aperture  is  reduced  to
increase the focusing parameter. On entry, the beam is not
yet  bunched,  allowing  the  use  of  weak  transverse
focusing.  By  the  time  the  beam  starts  to  bunch,  the
focusing is  strong enough to confine  the  bunched  beam.
The reduced focusing strength at the entrance means the
matched  beam  size  is  larger  than  it  would  have  been
without  the  reduced  focusing  strength.  This  allows  the
final focusing solenoid to be placed farther away from the
RFQ.  Without  this  feature  proper  placement  of  the  final
focusing solenoid is right at the RFQ entrance. With the
focusing solenoid 30-cm from the RFQ, both simulations
and  experimental  evidence  indicate  the  beam  becomes
un-neutralized  in  the  last  10  cm  before  the  RFQ  match
point. Moving the final focusing solenoid 15-cm from the
RFQ  counteracts  the  effect  of  the  defocusing  from  the
beam’s space charge.

2  RFQ DESIGN

2.1  Acceleration Section

In  a  typical  RFQ  that  has  constant  focusing  strength
and constant gap voltage, as vane modulation increases to
accelerate the beam, the aperture shrinks and beam can be
lost on the vane tips. In an RFQ, as the energy rises the
cell  length  increases  and,  for  a  given  modulation,  the
accelerating gradient decreases inversely with cell length.
Since the  maximum practical modulation is  about  2,  the
RFQ would become very long if the gap voltage remained
constant. To reduce beam loss and shorten the RFQ,  we
maintain a large aperture, and increase the vane voltage.

Figure 2: Bead perturbation measurement of the RF fields
in the RFQ. The Quadrupole fields are normalized to
100%. The two residual dipole modes mixed with the
RFQ fields are typically less then 2%.

The  increased  gap  voltage  substantially  increases  the
accelerating  field,  thus  shortening  the  RFQ.  However,
even  with  this  increased  gap  voltage,  eight  meters  of
length is required to accelerate the beam to 6.7 MeV.
 2.2  Resonate Coupling

A conventional 8-m-long, 350-MHz RFQ would not be
stable.  Small  perturbations  would  distort 
the  field
distribution intolerably [10,11]. Therefore, four 2-m-long
RFQs (labeled as segments A, B, C and D in Figure 1) are
resonantly  coupled  to  form  the  8-m-long  LEDA  RFQ.
The  resonant  coupling  is  implemented  by  separating  the
four 2-m RFQs by coupling  plates.  An  axial  hole  in  the
coupling plate  allows  the  vane  tips  to  nearly  touch.  The
capacitance  between  the  vane  tips  of  one  RFQ  and  the
next provides the RF coupling between the 2-m-long RFQ
segments. The gap between the vane tips at the coupling
joint is 0.32 cm. To minimize the effect of this gap on the
beam, the gap is placed so that as a bunched beam pulse
passes the gap, the RF electric field crosses zero. The RF
field  is  in  phase  in  all  four  segments.  The  “coupling
mode” has a strong electric field across the 0.32-cm gap
and has one longitudinal node in each 2-m RFQ segment.
The  coupling  mode’s  longitudinal  component  of  the
electric  field  transmits  RF  power,  and  it  is  this  mode
which  provides  the  stability  to  the  fields.  When  the
coupling  mode is strongly excited (by a perturbation  for
example),  a  saw-tooth  pattern  can  appear  on  the  field
distribution [11].
 2.3  RFQ Fields

fields  were  measured  with 

Figure  2  shows  a  measurement  of  the  fields  in  the
RFQ.  The 
the  bead
perturbation technique in the magnetic field region close
to the outer wall. In this measurement a bead is mounted
on a plastic tape that is supported at the ends of the RFQ
and at the coupling plates. The plastic tape with the bead
moves  on  a  pulley  system  and  travels  through  all  4
quadrants of the RFQ. The bead perturbs the frequency of
the  RFQ  in  proportion  to  the  stored  energy  of  the
magnetic  field  displaced  by  the  bead.  The  frequency
perturbation  is  measured  versus  bead  position  and  the
relative magnetic field strength is derived. In Figure 2, the
bumps in the field are caused by local perturbations in the
magnetic field near the slug tuners. A total of 128 tuners
are used to “tune” the RFQ to the correct field distribution
and  frequency.  The 
the  quadrupole
magnetic field that occur every 200-cm are caused by the
coupling plates. These dips and bumps do  not  appear  in
the electric field on axis. The RFQ is tuned using a “least
squares”  fitting  procedure  that  minimizes  the  difference
between  the  measured  fields  and  the  design  fields.  The
slug  tuner  insertions  are  the  parameters  in  this  “least
squares” fit.

The minimum aperture occurs about 1.4 meters into the
RFQ,  at  the  end  of  the  gentle  buncher.  This  is  also  the

larger  dips 

in 

location where the transverse current limit goes through a
minimum. Typically, the end of the gentle buncher is the
RFQ  choke  point  that  determines  the  maximum  current
that can be accelerated (~200 mA for this RFQ) [7]. The
theoretical  current  limit  assumes  ideal  quadrupole  fields
and  can  only  be  used  as  a  rough  guide  of  the  actual
current limit.
 2.4  RFQ Design

The  RFQ  was  designed  with  the  code  PARMTEQM
[12]. PARMTEQM is an acronym for “Phase and Radial
Motion in a Transverse Electric Quadrupole; Multipoles”.
This code includes the effect of higher-order multipoles in
the RFQ fields that are important in accurately predicting
beam loss. In addition, PARMTEQM requires a realistic
description of the input beam to accurately simulate beam
losses  in  the  RFQ  when  the  input  beam  is  not  ideal.
Simulations of the beam transport through the LEBT [3]
with  PARMELA  [13,14]  produces  a  more  realistic
distribution of particles for input into the RFQ simulation
code than the ideal input distributions generated internally
by  PARMTEQM.  Simulations  of 
the  RFQ  with
PARMTEQM  predict  output  beam  emittances  in  the
range from 0.16 to 0.22 mm-mrad depending on the input
distribution.  The  simulations  also  predict  the  x  and  y
emittances  to  be  the  same.  The  measured  x  and  y
emittance 
[15,16]  are  0.25  and  0.31  mm-mrad
respectively.  There  are  also  minor  differences  between
the predicted and measured Twiss parameters [15].

 3  LEBT MODIFICATIONS

Until we added an electron trap described below to the
LEBT,  our  transmission  measurements  were  inaccurate.
The  input  current  was  less  than  the  current  out  of  the
RFQ. Electrons (from the beam plasma) flowing into the
RFQ reduced the positive proton current measured by the
toroid  at 
the  RFQ  entrance.  These  electrons  are
responsible  for  neutralizing  the  proton  beam  space

charge.  We  used  the  computer  code  PARMELA  to
perform  a  simulation  of  the  beam  traveling  through  the
LEBT  with  98%  space  charge  neutralization,  except  for
the last 10 cm in  front  of  the  RFQ.  There,  we  made  the
simple  assumption  that  the  space  charge  neutralization
changed linearly from 98% to 0 in 10 cm. The results of
this  simulation  showed  that  the  beam  could  not  be
properly  “matched”  into  the  RFQ.  Space  charge  caused
the beam to defocus so much in the last 10 cm that it no
longer converged as it entered the RFQ. This limited the
maximum  beam  current  out  of  the  RFQ  to  only  89 mA,
equal to the maximum pulsed current that we obtained by
August 23, 1999. Simulations showed that if we installed
an electron trap to prevent the electrons from flowing into
the  RFQ  and  decreased  the  solenoid-to-RFQ  distance
from  30  to  15 cm,  then  the  beam  could  be  matched
properly into the RFQ. The electron trap is a ring placed
at  the  entrance  of  the  RFQ.  The  potential  on  this  ring,
−1 kV, prevents low-energy plasma electrons from going
through  it,  but  does  not  affect  the  75-keV  protons.  We
made these changes to the LEBT on August 28–29, 1999.

4  TRANSMISSION THROUGH RFQ
Using  the  calculated  beam  from  the  modified  LEBT,
PARMTEQM  predicts  93%  transmission  with  the  RFQ
operating  at  the  design  field  levels.  This  transmission  is
slightly  less 
transmission  previously
predicted  with  assumption  that  the  space  charge  is  96%
neutralized  all  the  way  to  the  RFQ  match  point  [17].
RFQTRAK [18], a code that calculates the 3D space and
image  charge  effects  in  an  RFQ,  agreed  very  well  with
PARMTEQM.  The  measured  transmission  has  been  as
high  as  94%  at  100 mA  when  the  RFQ  fields  are  10%
above  the  design  field  strength.  Figure  3  shows  a
comparison  between 
the  calculated  and  measured
transmission  as  a  function  of  field  strength.  This  figure
also shows an anomalous drop in transmission at the end
of a 300-µs long pulse when the RFQ RF field strength is
at or below the design field strength.

The  transmission  drops  unexpectedly  about  150 µs  into
the  pulse.  As  we  raise  the  RFQ  fields  the  transmission
stays high for longer times. With fields above ~105% of
design  we  no  longer  observe  this  drop,  even  for  long
pulses and CW operation.

We  observe  higher-than-expected  activation  near  the
high-energy end of the RFQ, consistent with high-energy
beam loss. If uncorrected, the frequency of the RFQ drops
when it accelerates a high average beam current. The lost
beam  impinges  upon  and  heats  the  vane  tips,  causing
them  to  expand  inward,  reducing  the  gap.  However,  the
water-cooling system reacts by increasing the temperature
of the outer wall to increase the gap, thereby restoring the
resonate frequency. Operating the RFQ with fields about
10% above design  greatly reduces the  magnitude of  this
beam loss.

The total RF power does not appear to change when the
transmission  drops.  However,  when  the  transmission
drops, the RF fields appear to increase slightly in the last
meter of the RFQ as though there was less beam loading
in that section [4].

increase 

reducing 

the  beam  size 

We  theorize  that  the  RFQ  fields  are  trapping  low-
energy  H+  ions  near  the  axis  [20].  This  extra  charge
causes 
the
transmission. This is also consistent with the observation
that the beam would cause the beam stop collimator ring
to glow whenever the vacuum in the RFQ exceeded about
1-2 x10-7 Torr. Our  conjecture  is  the  beam  ionizes  more
of  the  residual  gas  (mostly  H2)  and  the  resulting  H+  is
likely  to  be  trapped  in  the  RFQ  bore.  Preliminary
simulations with a modified version of PARMTEQM, in
which  an  artificial  space  charge  is  introduced  near  the
axis,  show  beam  distributions  similar  to  that  shown  in
Figure 5 (b).

At design fields or lower enough beam may strike the
vane tips, creating H+ ions that get trapped temporarily in
the beam channel. As this trapped charge accumulates the
beam  becomes  larger  still  until  the  transmission  drops
suddenly. Following Ref. [20] to calculate the amount of
charge  that  can  be  captured  both  transversely  and
longitudinally  cannot  explain 
in
transmission. However, because the RFQ is  8  m  long,  a
large amount of charge may be captured by the transverse
focusing  fields  temporarily,  provided  there  is  a  large
enough supply of ions. This charge will tend to flow out
both ends of the RFQ, but enough charge can accumulate
to significantly affect the transmission.

5  THE RF POWER AND RESONATE

CONTROL SYSTEM

to 

The  low-level  RF  (LLRF)  system  [21]  controls  the
amplitude,  phase,  and  frequency  of  the  RF  power
supplied 
the  RFQ.  We  used  X-ray-endpoint
measurements [7,22] to calibrate the fields at 3 different
values of the setpoint in the field-control-module (FCM).
The  resonance  control  module  (RCM)  determines  the
resonant frequency of the RFQ by comparing the phase of
the forward power with a sample of the RF in the RFQ.
The  RCM  sends  a  frequency  error  signal  to  the  RFQ’s
water-cooling system. When the resonant frequency error
is  greater  than  a  specified  value  (~20  kHz)  from  350
MHz, this module switches to a frequency agile mode and
synthesizes the frequency required to drive the RF at the
RFQ’s resonant frequency.

The  resonant-control  cooling  system,  [23]  using  the
frequency-error  signal  from  the  RCM,  controls  the
temperature of the water flowing to 4 cooling systems on
each of the 4 segments. Each of these 4 cooling systems
provides  water  to  the  outer-wall-cooling  channels  to
maintain  the  resonant  frequency  of  the  RFQ  near  350
MHz.  Each  of  these  outer-wall-cooling  systems  has  a
manually  set  mixing  valve  that  combines  water  exiting
the  outer  wall  cooling  channels  with  the  water  provided
by  the  resonant-control  system.  These  manually-set
the  compensation 
mixing  valves  provide 
the
differential  heating  of 
the  4  RFQ  segments.  A
multiplexed system that uses 64 RF pickup probes in the
RFQ  measures  the  field  amplitude.  Four  probes  in  each
quadrant of each of the 4 segments provide the field data.
After  inspecting  a  plot  of  the  field  data  the  4  mixing
valves are adjusted to make the field distribution at high
power nearly the same as the field distribution measured
in the RFQ at low power.

6  CW OPERATION

On December 17, 1999 we had the first long run with
CW beam current of ~100 mA. This run had a few short
interruptions but averaged  98.7 mA  over  3.3 hr [7].  Key
factors that were instrumental in reaching this goal are:

• 

•  Reducing the distance between the LEBT solenoid 2

and the RFQ from 30 cm to 15 cm and adding the
electron trap at the RFQ entrance.
Increasing the RF field level in the RFQ to 10%
above design reduced the anomalous beam loss in the
high-energy end of the RFQ.

•  The general improvement in the level of conditioning

of the RFQ with operation time. Observations
suggest that the vacuum in the RFQ must be about
1.x 10-7 Torr or lower for good operation.

The  RFQ  is  designed  for  peak  fields  at  1.8 Kilpatrick
field [24]. When operating at 2 times the Kilpatrick field,
the spark rate is not a problem. The estimated spark rate is
only  1  to  at  most  2  sparks  per  minute  average.  When  a
spark is detected, the RF power is turned off for 100 µs.
After  the  RFQ  is  fully  conditioned,  most  of  the  beam
interruptions are caused by injector arcs, HPRF, or LLRF
problems.  When  these  problems  and  a  few  others  are
fixed  we  see  no  fundamental  reasons  why  the  RFQ  can
not  run  for  very  long  periods  of  time  with  only  short
~100 µs interruptions in the beam.

7  SUMMARY

The  LEDA  RFQ  performs  as  designed,  provided  the
RF  field  is  raised  about  10%  above  the  design  level  to
reduce beam loss in the high-energy end of the RFQ and
to  reach  the  design  transmission.  The  present  RFQ
simulation codes do not have the capability of simulating
low-energy ions trapped in the RFQ focusing fields. The
addition of an electron trap at the entrance to the RFQ is
essential to the measurement of the transmission through
the  RFQ.  Simulation  of  the  beam  transport  through  the
LEBT  with  PARMELA  allowed  understanding 
the
injection of the beam into the RFQ.

The HEBT and beam stop have been moved ~11 m to
make room for a 52 quadrupole beam transport line. This
beam  line  will  be  used  to  study  beam-halo  of  both
matched and unmatched high-current beams [25].

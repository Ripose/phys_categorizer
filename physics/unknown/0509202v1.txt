Abstract—  Two-dimensional 
integral 
equation analysis of a notched circular microdisk resonator is 
presented.  Results  obtained  provide  accurate  description  of 
optical  modes,  free  from  the  staircasing  and  discretization 
errors  of  other  numerical  techniques.  Splitting  of  the  double 
degenerate  Whispering-Gallery  (WG)  modes  and  directional 
light output is demonstrated. The effect of the notch depth and 
width on the resonance wavelengths, Q-factors, and emission 
patterns  is  studied.  Further  improvement  of  the  directionality 
in  an  elliptical  notched  microdisk. 
is  demonstrated 
Applications  of  the  notched  resonators  to  the  design  of 
microdisk lasers, oscillators, and biosensors are discussed.

I.  INTRODUCTION

IELECTRIC  or  semiconductor  resonators  shaped  as 
circular  cylinders  and  thin  disks  are,  together  with 
spherical  particles,  among  the  structures  able  to  support  the 
high-Q  WG  modes.  Semiconductor microdisk lasers are very 
attractive  light  sources  offering  small  mode  volumes  and 
ultralow 
circular 
microcavities  provide  very  high  optical  confinement,  which 
results  in  record  Q-factors  of  the  WG  modes  [2,3],  however, 
they  have 
their 
important  drawbacks 
applications.  These  are,  first,  non-directive  emission  patterns 
with  many  identical  beams,  because  a  mode  field  in  the  disk 
plane depends on the azimuthal angle ϕ as either

To ensure a single-mode operation of the microdisk laser, it 
is desirable to stabilize the lasing mode against the fabrication 
imperfections  [6]  and  either  suppress  all  the  parasitic  modes 
(i.e., spoil their Q-factors) or detune their resonant frequencies 
away from that of the lasing mode [7]. As the lasing mode, we 
consider  a  fundamental  transverse  electric  (TE)  first-radial-
order  WG  mode  (one  of  the  modes  of  a  doublet)  with  the 
frequency  at  or  near  the  spontaneous  emission  peak  of  the 
cavity  material  [2].  Several  types  of  parasitic  modes  can  be 
supported  in  a  microdisk  resonator,  such  as  modes  of  the 
orthogonal (TM) polarization, higher-radial-order WG modes, 
and the other first-radial-order WG mode of a doublet. 

TM-polarized  emission  is  not  usually  observed  in  thin 
microdisks of several microns in diameter [3]. In high-index-
contrast  microdisks,  the  first  radial-order  WG-mode  field  is 
concentrated inside the microdisk very close to its rim. All of 
the higher-radial-order WG modes penetrate deeper inside the 
cavity. They can be suppressed by either decreasing the cavity 
radius  and  thus  increasing  their  diffraction  losses  [8],  or  by 
removing material from the interior of the disk, which disturbs 
only  the  high-radial-order  WG  modes  [7].  However,  the 
former  approach  leads  to  increasing  the  diffraction  losses  of 
the  lasing  mode  as  well,  and  neither  of  them  efficiently 
suppresses or shifts in frequency the second nearly degenerate 
first-radial-order WG mode of a doublet.  

Recently,  a  suppression  of  such  a  parasitic  mode  using  a 
circular  microcavity  with  a  rotationally  periodic  modification 
to  its  rim  -  a  microgear  laser  cavity  -  has  been  reported  [9]. 
Enhancement of the lasing WG mode Q factor in such a cavity 
enabled  microgear  lasers  with  low  threshold  currents  to  be 
fabricated  [10].  However,  for  the  microlaser  applications, 
another important design parameter is the directionality of the 
light output [11]. The emission from a thin circular microdisk 
mostly  occurs  in  the  disk  plane.  Unfortunately,  due  to 
rotational  symmetry  of  the  circular  microdisk  or  microgear 
resonators, lateral light directionality cannot be achieved. One 
of the ways to extract the light from the resonant cavity is to 
use  output  evanescent-field  couplers  of  various  geometries 
[12].  Alternatively,  microcavity  shape  deformations  that 
destroy  the  rotational  symmetry  can  be  introduced  [13-16], 
which include elongation, projections, notches, and openings.  
In  this  paper,  we  perform,  for  the  first  time  to  our 
knowledge, a detailed and accurate 2-D numerical study of the 

 

resonance and emission characteristics of a notched microdisk 
structure.  We  demonstrate  efficient  splitting  and  detuning  of 
double-degenerate  WG-modes  as  well  as  in-plane  directional 
emission.  As  the  microcavities  of  interest  have  wavelength-
scale  dimensions  and  regions  of  high  contour  curvature, 
conventional  optical  ray-tracing  methods  such  as  paraxial 
approximation  and  billiard  theory  fail  to  provide  reliable 
results.  Therefore,  in  this  paper  we  analyze  a  microdisk 
resonator  with  a  narrow  notch  using  a  2-D  Muller  boundary 
integral  equation  (MBIE)  formulation  and  the  trigonometric-
Galerkin  discretization  method  [17].  Unlike  the  FDTD 
techniques,  which

excitation  [3,9],  this  accurate,  reliable  and  versatile  method 
enables  a  direct  a  study  of  the  resonance  spectra,  Q-factors, 
and emission patterns of arbitrarily shaped 2-D microcavities.

II.  NOTCHED MICRODISK GEOMETRY  

Fig.  1  presents  the  in-plane  geometry  of  a  semiconductor 
microdisk with a narrow notch and the coordinate system used 
in  the  analysis.  We  consider  a  2-D  model  of  the  structure  in 
the x-y plane, accounting for the microdisk thickness by using 
the  Effective  Index  Method.  Here,  the  effective  refractive 
index  of  the  2-D  microcavity  is  taken  as  the  normalized 
propagation  constant  of  the  fundamental  guided  mode  in  an 
equivalent planar waveguide at a wavelength corresponding to 
the spontaneous emission peak of the cavity material at room 
temperature [17].

The notch causes splitting of the double-degenerate WG modes. 

 

 

In the 2-D model, the microcavity can support the modes of 
two  polarizations:  transverse  electric  (TE)  with  the  electric 
field  vector  parallel  to  the  xy  plane  and  transverse  magnetic 
(TM)  with  the  same  vector  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  the 
microdisk.  In  a  thin  microdisk  whose  thickness  is  a  small 
fraction of the optical wavelength, quasi-TE-polarized modes 
are  dominant  due  to  much  larger  effective  index  values  [2]. 
Therefore,  in  our  numerical  analysis  we  will  consider  only 
these  modes.  We  will  also  use  the  value  of  the  effective 
refractive  index  of  a  slightly  lossy  microcavity  given  by 
. The real part of this value corresponds to

III.  PROBLEM FORMULATION AND SOLUTION 

In the 2-D formulation, the total field can be characterized by 
a  single  scalar  function,  which  represents  either  Ez  or  Hz 
component  in  the  case  of  the  TM  or  TE  polarization, 
respectively.  This  function  satisfies  the  Helmholtz  equation 
together  with  continuity  conditions  on  contour L,  and  can  be 
reduced to the following set of the second-kind boundary IEs 
with integrable kernels [17,18]:

IV.  MODE SPLITTING IN THE NOTCHED MICRODISK 

TE-polarized  modes  of  ideal  circular  microdisk  are  usually 
classified  as  Emnq  modes,  where  the  subscripts  m,  n  and  q 
correspond  to  the  number  of  azimuthal,  radial,  and  off-plane 
variations of the mode field, respectively. A mode displays a

modes  supported  by  thin  microdisks  q=0  and  thus  omit  this 
index.  All  the  WGEmn  modes  in  circular  microdisks  with 
are  double  degenerate  (with  either  cos(ms)  or  sin(ms)

angular  field  dependence)  due  to  the  microdisk  rotational 
symmetry. We shall denote these two orthogonal states of the 
same  mode  as  S-mode  and  A-mode,  respectively,  having 
either  symmetrical  or  anti-symmetrical  field  patterns  with 
respect to s=0.

convenient  to  count  the  angle  s  from  this  line.  When  the

In  the  vicinity  of  the  spontaneous  emission  peak  in  a  1.8 
μm-diameter  GaInAsP  circular  microdisk,  we  find  a  double-
degenerate WGE6,1 mode with λ = 1.547 μm and Q = 513. In 
Fig.  2,  we  plot  the  mode  wavelengths  and  Q-factors  as  a 
function of the notch depth. Fig. 2a demonstrates that making 
a  notch  causes  splitting  of  the  double-degenerate  WGE6,1 
mode into two modes of orthogonal symmetry.

wavelength. This causes mode hopping and parasitic losses. A 
modified  resonator  design  that  avoids  two  equally  coupled 
closely  located  WG  modes  may  help  achieve  a  quasi-single-
mode operation of microdisk lasers, optical waveguide filters 
[21] and oscillators for satellite communications [22]. 

V.  STABILITY OF THE HIGH-Q A-MODE 

We shall now study how the variations in the notch width and 
depth may affect the resonance wavelength and quality factor 
of  the  high-Q  anti-symmetrical  mode.  Fig.  4  shows  the  A-
mode  wavelength  detuning  (a)  and  Q-factor  change  (b)  with 
an  increase  of  the  notch  depth  for  three  values  of  the  notch 
width.  As  expected,  the  wider  the  notch  the  more  noticeable 
mode wavelength detuning and Q-factor decrease. However, a 
general  behavior  of  the  graphs  in  Fig.  4  is  the  same  for  all 
values of the notch width, and even in the case of the widest 
notch  (τ=10)  the  A-mode  Q-factor  remains  relatively  high 
(~70% of that of the circular microdisk). 

Fig.  3.  Near-field  portraits  (12.5%  contours)  of  (a)  A-mode  (λ  =  1.531 
μm) and (b) S- mode (λ = 1.532 μm) of the notched microdisk with the 
same parameters as in Fig. 2 and the normalized notch depth δ/a = 0.4. 

 

 

In  a  previous  publication  [5],  we  showed  that  efficient 
manipulation  of  the  mode  wavelength  and  Q-factor  could  be 
achieved  if  a  contour  deformation  periodicity  is  matched  to 
the  modal  field  pattern.  Although  the  cavity  shown  in  Fig.  1 
has  a  localized  rather  then  periodical  deformation,  similar 
matching  can  be  foreseen.  Therefore,  the  notch  width  was 
chosen  as  a  half  of  the  distance  between  a  neighboring 
maximum  and  minimum  in  the  unperturbed  WGE6,1  mode 
field  pattern  (τ   = 12). Such a localized contour deformation 
is  expected  to  have  more  significant  effect  on  the  S-mode, 
which has a field maximum on the x-axis, i.e., in the region of 
the  notch,  than  on  the  A-mode,  which  has  a  zero  field  at  the 
same  location.  Indeed,  it  can  be  seen  in  Fig.  2b  that  the  Q-
factor  of  the  S-mode  is  noticeably  decreased  in  the  notched 
microdisk, while that of the A-mode remains almost as high as 
in the ideal circular resonator.

The  field  portraits  (equal  value  curves  of 

)  of 
the  A-mode  and  S-mode  in  the  notched  microdisk  are 
presented  in  Fig.  3.  As  expected,  the  A-mode  near-field 
pattern is not visibly affected by the notch, while the S-mode 
field  pattern  is  clearly  distorted.  Because  of  the  much  higher 
energy leakage at the region of the notch, the S-mode Q-factor 
is lower that that of the A-mode. 

Efficient  separation  of  two  resonant  wavelengths  in  the 
notched microdisk, together with the spoiling of the Q-factor 
of  one  mode  of  a  doublet,  is  crucially  important  in  many 
applications of resonators with WG modes. Due to fabrication 
imperfections,  circular  disk  resonators  spectra  often  display 
two  closely  spaced  resonances  around  each  WM  mode

function of the notch depth for three different values of the notch width. 
 

Naturally,  to  efficiently  split  higher-azimuthal-order  WG 
modes  without  spoiling  the  A-mode  Q-factor,  narrower 
notches  will  be  required  (the  larger  the  azimuthal  mode 
number  the  narrower  the  notch).  It  should  be  noted  here  that 
introducing  notches  whose  width  is  not  matched  to  the  WG-
mode  field  patterns  (too  wide)  affects  the  modes  of  both 
symmetries  almost  equally  (similarly  to  periodic  contour 
corrugations  or  symmetrical  shape  deformations  [4,5]). 
Namely,  it  may  significantly  blueshift  both  modes  and  spoil 
their Q-factors, instead of efficiently tuning their wavelengths 
away from each other.  

Another  important  design  parameter  that  depends  on  the 
precision  of  a  fabrication  procedure  is  the  notch  depth.  The 
variations  in  the  notch  depth  can  result  in  unpredictable

detuning  of  the  wavelengths  of  both  modes.  However,  it  can 
be seen in Fig. 4a that with the increase of the notch depth the 
values  of  resonance  wavelengths  change  more  rapidly  for 
shallow 
than  for  deep  notches.  Moreover,  after  first 
decreasing  significantly,  the  values  of  Q-factors  slightly 
increase  and  then  flatten  with  further  increase  of  the  notch 
depth (Fig. 4b). 

 

VI.  EMISSION DIRECTIONALITY 

Having found the complex natural frequencies of (13) we can 
compute  the  far-field  emission  patterns  as  well  as  the  near-
field  portraits.  In  the  far  zone  of  the  microdisk  (

field function can be presented in the following form [17]:

WGE10,1  modes  in  notched  microdisks  with  diameters  1.8  μm,  2.2  μm 
and  2.7  μm,  respectively,  as  a  function  of  the  notch  depth.  The 
wavelengths  are  normalized  to  the  corresponding  wavelengths  of  the 
circular  microdisks:  λc(WGE6,1)  =  1.547  μm,  λc(WGE8,1)  =  1.521  μm, 
λc(WGE10,1) = 1.569 μm. 

 
By looking at the WGE6,1 mode field portraits (Fig. 3), one 
can notice that the mode field penetrates rather far towards the 
center  of  the  microdisk.  It  is  well  known,  however,  that  the 
 are stronger 
electromagnetic fields of WG modes with 
confined to the rim of the resonator. Therefore one can expect 
similar  graphs  of  their  resonance  wavelengths  to  flatten  at 
smaller values of the notch depth.

First,  we  calculated  the  near  and  the  far-field  patterns  of 
the  high-Q  anti-symmetrical  WGE6,1  mode  (Fig.  7).  The  A-
mode  emission  pattern  is  found  to  consist  of  twelve  beams, 
similarly  to  its  counterpart  for  a  perfectly  circular  cavity. 
However, the beams are no more identical, i.e., emission into 
some of the beams is more intense than into others. Still it is 
clear that the notched microdisk laser source operating on the 
A-mode  will  not  emit  light  unidirectionally  –  at  least  two 
equal  main  beams  are  always  present.  Better  control  of  the 
emission  directionality  can  be  achieved  with  the  S-mode, 
whose modal pattern is not zero along the symmetry axis both 
in perfect and notched disks (Fig. 3b).

notched  microdisks  with  the  same  parameters  as  in  Fig.  5,  and  the 
normalized notch depths δ/a = 0.5 and δ/a = 0.6, respectively. 
 

In  Fig.  5,  the  resonance  wavelength  detuning  with  the 
increase of the notch depth is plotted for three A-WG modes: 
WGE6,1,  WGE8,1,  and  WGE10,1.  Though  for  all  the  three 
modes  the  wavelength  values  are  first  changing  rapidly,  then 
they begin to stabilize at a certain level. Notice that this level 
is reached faster for the modes with larger m. The near fields 
for  the  A-WGE10,1  (δ/a  =  0.5)  and  A-WGE8,1  (δ/a  =  0.6) 
modes are plotted in Fig. 6. The conclusion is that if the notch 
is  deep  enough  to  pierce  through  the  area  of  the  WG-mode 
field concentration, slight variations in its depth do not cause 
noticeable detuning of the A-mode.

The  degree  of  collimation  of  the  emitted  light  can  be 
measured in terms of directivity. This quantity is well known 
in antenna theory and is defined as the ratio of the intensity of 
light  radiated  in  the  main-beam  direction ϕ0  to  the  intensity 
averaged over all directions:

the  normalized  notch  depth δ/a  =  0.14,  corresponding  to  the  maximum 
of directivity in Fig. 8. 
 

We  expect  to  control  the  WG-mode  emission  pattern  and 
enhance the directivity by tuning the notch geometry, with the 
aim  to  design  light  sources  with  narrow  directional  emission 
patterns.  Fig.  8  shows  how  the  value  of  directivity  of  the 
symmetrical  S-WGE6,1  mode  varies  with  the  increase  of  the 
notch depth. The emission pattern has the main beam at ϕ=0o 
(Fig.  9b)  and  a  number  of  sidelobes.  (Note,  that  the  highest 
intensity  in  the  near-field  distribution  of  the  S-mode  is 
observed  at  the  region  of  the  notch,  i.e.,  at  ϕ=180o).  The 
directivity  of  emission  increases  rapidly  with  increasing  the 
notch  depth,  reaching  a  maximum  at  δ/a=0.14.  Near-field 
portrait  and  far-field  emission  pattern  shown  in  Fig.  9  are 
calculated for the notch depth corresponding to the maximum 
of  directivity  in  Fig.  8.  Note,  however,  that  the  S-mode  Q-
factor is five times lower than the Q-factor of the A-mode (see 
Fig. 2b), which normally leads to a higher threshold of lasing 
[19,20].

elliptical notched microdisk with the minor axis length 0.9 μm, and the 
normalized    notch  depth  δ/a  =  0.14  as  a  function  of  the  ellipse 
elongation parameter μ. 
 

Though the S-mode emission is directional, it is desirable 
to  further  reduce  the  sidelobes  level.  It  has  been  observed 

6

theoretically  and  experimentally  [4,8,13],  that  emission  from 
the  elliptical  microdisks  supporting  distorted  WG-modes  is 
than  from  circular  ones.  In  elliptical 
more  directional 
resonators,  WG-mode  emission  occurs  at  the  points  of  the 
highest curvature of the contour and collimates into a number 
of beams with the highest-intensity beams forming around the 
ellipse  minor  axis  (i.e.,  at  ϕ=0o  and  180o  for  the  ellipse 
elongated  along  the  y-axis).  Such  improvement  of  emission 
directionality  with  increasing  the  ellipticity  of  the  microdisk 
up 
to  a  certain  critical  value  has  been  demonstrated 
experimentally in Ref. 8.

elongation  parameter  μ  =  1.05,  corresponding  to  the  maximum  of 
directivity in Fig. 10. 
 

With  this  in  mind,  we  expect  to  further  enhance  the 
directivity of the emission pattern by adjusting both the notch 
depth  and  the  ellipticity  of  the  resonator.  Simulation  results 
obtained with the same algorithm are presented in Figs. 10. By 
varying the elongation parameter of the microdisk, μ (the ratio 
of the major to the minor axis length), we observe a maximum 
of directivity at μ=1.05. The near and far field patterns plotted 
in Fig. 11 for such a cavity clearly show a highly directional 
emission with weaker sidelobes. 

VII.  CONCLUSIONS 

Results from the Muller boundary integral equations analysis 
of  notched  microcavities  have  been  presented  that  provide 
clear insight into their improved optical performance over its 
smooth  microdisk  equivalent.  Proposed  notched  resonator 
design provides efficient control of both frequency separation 
and  Q-factors  of  two  symmetry  types  of  originally  double-
degenerate WG-modes, as well as directional light output. The 
directivity  of  emission  can  be  further  improved  by  distorting 
the microdisk shape from circular to elliptical one, although in 
general the demands of the high Q-factor and high directivity 
are contradictory. Applications of the notched disk resonators 
supporting  non-degenerate  first  radial-order  high-Q  WG-
modes are evident. They are expected to have higher stability 
to fabrication imperfections and provide better characteristics 
of semiconductor microdisk lasers and microwave and optical 
oscillators  [6,21,22].  Besides,  high  near-field  intensity  in  the 
region  of  the  notch  can  possibly  be  exploited  to  enhance  the 
sensitivity  of  photonic  biosensors  based  on  the  WG-mode 
resonators [23].

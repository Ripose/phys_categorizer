In this paper it is demonstrated  that 1/f power spectrum  appears in the  process originated by the 
superposition  of  many  single-sided  random  telegraph  signals  (RTS  or  RTN)  with  the  same 
amplitude, probability and relaxation time. Indeed, the coincidences of these RTSs generate self-
organizing fluctuations which are responsible for the generation of 1/f noise under various aspects. 
The  accord  of  the  exposed  model  with  other  models  and  with  various  experimental  results  is 
displayed. 
 
1. Introduction  
 
  The main feature of 1/f noise is that its power spectrum increases with decreasing 
frequency f down to the lowest possible frequencies for conducting measurements. 
This  noise  is  therefore  spectrally  scaling,  that  is,  it  is  statistically  identical  to  its 
transformation by contraction in time or another independent variable, followed by a 
corresponding change in intensity. This scaling property is typical of the fractals [1] 
and it reveals the presence of long-term correlations. 
The  self-similar  (fractal)  structure  of  1/f  noise  is  revealed  by  the  constancy  of  its 
average power per decade and by the scale invariance of its autocorrelation function 
ψ(θ). Indeed, if S(f) = 1/f , tanks to the Wiener-Khintchine theorem, we have

being ℑ-1 the inverse Fourier transform. Hence, 1/f noise cannot be characterized by 
a single relaxation time τ. In fact,  if ψ(θ) = σ2 exp(-|θ|/τ) , then ψ(αθ) ≠ψ(θ), being 
σ2 the variance of the fluctuation. 
 Despite  great  progress  being  made  in  1/f  noise  physics,  the  source  of  these 
fluctuations remains unknown in the case of most systems and the problem remains 
largely unsolved in its generality. 
 It would be too lengthy to report all references concerning 1/f noise but an extensive 
bibliography has been drawn up in [2] and [3]. 
 The  present  work  furnishes  a  further  contribution,  and  important  settlements,  to  a 
model introduced in the references [4] [5]. This model explains 1/f noise as due to 
the  superposition  of  many  similar  bistable  fluctuators  having  the  same  power 
spectrum,  in  other  words  by  the  superposition  of  many  single-sided  random 
telegraph  signals  (RTS),  or  random  telegraph  noises  (RTN),  with  same  amplitude,

probability and relaxation time τ.  These two-state fluctuations can be generated by 
elementary physical processes such as the intermittent presence of same objects, or 
physical quantities, on microscopic or macroscopic scale.  
 Commonly,  1/f  noise  is  explained  by  a  weighed  summation  of  many  similar 
independent  Lorentzians  with  a  broad  distribution  of  relaxation  times,  without  a 
general  characterisation  and  justification  [2][6].  Indeed,  “the  question  of  the 
independence  of  the  processes  is  hardly  ever  discussed  when  this  is  the  essential 
problem” [7]. 
 We shall see that the analysis of the coincidences (the number c of contemporary up  
levels  during  the  sampling  time  ΔT)  of  many  similar  single-sided  RTSs 
demonstrates a more general origin of 1/f noise, where the possible superposition of 
independent  Lorentzians,  with  a  distribution  of  relaxation  times,  appears  as 
consequence and not as  cause.  
 In  the  following,  we  refer  only  to  time  phenomena,  approaching  gradually  the 
problem.  
 
 
2. Superposition of similar signals 
 
In general, if U(t) is a stationary process its autocorrelation function ψ(θ)U must be 
independent from the time t , while ψ(θ)U depends from the shift time θ.  
 The autocorrelation function of U(t) is given by

where the integration interval, between –T/2 and T/2, can be chosen at any point. In 
practice, the limit of the interval T corresponds to the measurement time.  
In  general,  the  process  U,    resulting  from  the  summation  of  N    signals  ui  has  the

where the terms with i=j denote autocorrelation functions, while the terms with i≠ j  
are of cross-correlation.  
 Operating  in  stationary  regime  (called  relaxed  in  ref.  [5]),  the  sum  of  N  similar 
stationary  and  stochastic  signals  ui  furnishes  identical  autocorrelation  functions 
ψa(θ),  for  any  i=j,  and    identical  cross-correlation  functions  ψc(θ),  for  any  i≠  j. 
Hence, the autocorrelation function of the resulting process U, will be

 Averagely, due the randomness of the signals 
 
                                      
 
 It is important to note that Eqs.(5) and (6), concern stationary and stochastic signals. 
In the case of originating single-sided RTSs,  the term of cross-correlation is just due 
to  the  random  presence  of  coincidences.  Indeed,  if  hypothetically  the  coincidences 
are missing, thus ψc(θ) = 0. 
The  Wiener-Khintchine  theorem  (expressed  for  stationary  and  stochastic  processes 
[8]) permits us to find the power spectrum S(ω)U of U, by the Fourier transform of 
ψ(θ)U. So, from Eq.(5) we have 
 
                                       
 
where 
= S (ω)u and 
 Therefore, Eq.(7) may be written in the form 
                                      
                                       
 
where δ(ω) is the Dirac-delta. 
 In conclusion, in the sum of N signals which have the same power spectrum S(ω)u , 
the resulting power spectrum S(ω)U  consists of two additive terms: the term N S(ω)u 
independent from cross-correlations, and the cross-correlation term, which is due to 
the coincidences in case of  single-sided originating RTSs. 
 The  power  spectrum  S(ω)U  represents  also  the  power  spectrum  S(ω)ΔU  of  the 
fluctuations ΔU from the mean <U>, a part a dc component 
 
 
3. Superposition of single-sided rectangular signals  
 
 It  is  useful  to  consider  the  superposition  of    N  >>  1,  random-phased,  single-sided 
rectangular signals ui of the same: amplitude u, pulse duration and period τ0.  
 The process obtained summing these signals consists of various trains of pulses of 
different  amplitude  and  shape,    every  with  period  τ0  (see  the  example  of  Fig.1  for 
five signals).  
A train of pulses can emerge upon the others, in the resulting process, when it is due 
to a number of coincidences (in up level) which exceeds those of other trains. In any 
case this emersion is guaranteed if  c > N/2.

In particular, the whole coincidence of all the originating signals produces a single 
rectangular  process  of  amplitude  Nu  and  period  τ0.  In  this  case  the  autocorrelation 
function will be 
                                 
 
 The lack of coincidences (in up level) would yield instead 
 Therefore, the term of cross-correlation involves only coincidences and it can range 
from  zero  to  N(N-1)ψa(θ),  depending  on  the  phasing  of  the  originating  signals.  In 
case of random phasing of the originating  signals the cross-correlation term would 
be statistically steady, that this N(N-1) <ui>2
As  far  as  it  is  concerned  the  memory  of  a  periodic  signal,  being  the  value  of  the 
signal at a done instant correlated to the value of the signal at every other instant, the 
memory is infinite.   
 
 
4. Statistical properties of an  RTS 
 
Before to consider the superposition of many similar single-sided RTSs it is useful to 
recall the statistical properties of a single RTS [9]. 
 An RTS has only one relaxation time τ and this corresponds to the relationship

where τu denotes the mean lifetime in up level and τd that in down level.  
 The consequences of Eq.(10) are important. Indeed, as τ is accepted to represent the 
memory of the signal, the maximum of memory corresponds to τu = τd = τ, instead if 
τu  <<  τd,  or  vice  versa,  τ  ≅  τu  ,  or  τ  ≅  τd.  In  this  last  cases    the  RTS  approaches  a 
Poisson process. 
The probability pu  of up level is

where pu denotes the probability of finding the level u1 (up level), 1-pu the probability 
of finding the level u2 (down level), u1 – u2 = u and 
 the variance of 
the process. 
The  interevent  time  τk  between    two  successive  rising  (or  falling)  edges  fluctuates 
around an average time                                      
                                                          
 
 We can suppose Gaussian the distribution of τk , that is        
                          
                                                   
  
where  tk  is  the  occurrence  time  of  the  rising  (or  falling)  edges  of  the  RTS, εk    is  a 
random variable normally distributed around the zero with unity variance and σ  is 
the standard deviation of this fluctuation. 
 As  a  consequence  of  Eq.(15),  the  interval    τk  undergoes  a  Brownian  increase  or 
decrease. 
 This  representation  of  the  interevent  time  of  an  RTS  is  consistent  with  the 
Lorentzian power spectrum which appears at low frequency if f < Δtp with Δtp , being 
the characteristic pulse length, no matter the shape of pulses [10]. 
 
 
5. Superposition of single-sided RTSs 
 
 When  many  random-phased  single-sided  RTSs,  of  same  amplitude  and  relaxation 
time τ, are summed, they are cross-correlate by their  coincidences. 
 Differently from the rectangular signals, a coincidence among various RTSs phases 
the  signals  only  for  a  limited  time  (phasing  time),  according  the  value  of  c.     
Indeed,  the  Brownian  spread    of  the  occurrence  time  of  the  RTSs  is  statistically 
symmetric,  so  the  emersion  of  the  pulses  of  coincidence  degrades  in  the  time 
(phasing  time)  and  the  temporal  distance  between  the  maxima  of  whatever  two 
pulses of coincidence, within the same phasing time, will be averagely   nτ, with n 
an integer number. 
Therefore,  as  for  the  rectangular  signals,  the  structure  of  the  originating  RTSs 
reappears on the shape and on the average periodicity of the emerging pulses in the 
resulting process U. This periodicity persists within the phasing time which can be 
intended  as  a  relaxation  time  τph  (or  memory).  A  part  amplitude  and  shape  of  the 
pulses of coincidence, various relaxation times can appear in the resulting process, 
which  can  be  decomposed  in  a  set  of  independent  Lorentzians  of  different  τph  and 
variance, which mainly influence the high frequency power spectrum [10]. 

5

 This  results  evident  in  Fig.2,  where  we  can  see  the  decomposition  of  a  simple 
random sequence of phasing times of a resulting process, in three Lorentzians with 
different τph . The lack of coincidences in these three Lorentzians is obvious, while 
their variance is decreasing with τph , according to the rarity of the fluctuations in up 
level.  
  In  conclusion,  in  the  superposition  of  similar  RTSs,  the  pulses  due  to  the 
coincidences of the originating signals generate a process which can be interpreted 
by a sequence of phasing times. The pulses within a phasing time have a periodicity 
self-adjusting to an average value τ. As a consequence, the resulting process can be 
interpreted by a sum of independent Lorentzians, with different relaxation times τph 
and variances. A single Lorentzian, with the relaxation time of the originating RTSs, 
appears in addition to this set of independent Lorentzians. We shall see that this set 
of Lorentzians generates 1/f noise, while the presence of a Lorentzian, in addition to 
1/f noise, is ascertained in various experiments [11][12][13].   
As concerns the  shape of the  pulses,  it  reveals  a  self-organization process, such as 
the generation of stepped symmetrical triangles (see Fig.3A).  
 
5.1. The fluctuation of the coincidences  
 
Consider the number c of coincidences which result in the superposition of  N >> 1 
single-sided RTSs, with the same amplitude u and relaxation time τ .   
Call  P(c)  the  probability  of  c  coincidences,  in  the  sampling  time  ΔT,  and  Δc  the 
corresponding  double-sided  fluctuation  of  c  from  the  mean  c   and  P(Δc)  the 
probability of fluctuation Δc. 
 If  U  represents  the  summation  of  all  ui  signals,  we  call  ΔU  the  double-sided 
fluctuation of U from the mean  U , being U=cu and ΔU=Δc u. 
 The  particularity  of  the  amplitudes  ΔU  is  their  discrete  value,  for  they  can  be 
reached only through the eventuality of an increment  Δc = ΔU/u. 
When the number of the originating RTSs is high, and the probability of up level is 
not  too  small  (or  too  high),  the  distribution  of  the  amplitudes  Δc  approaches  a 
Gaussian.  
 Then the fluctuations Δc will follow the relationship

 The  same  distribution  is  worth  for  the  fluctuations  ΔU,  thanks  to  the  originating 
RTSs  of  the  same  amplitude.  Thus  the    probability  P(ΔU)  of  the  fluctuation  ΔU

The memory of the originating RTSs does not compromise the final distribution of 
the coincidences, for it depends only from the probability p and from N. In any case 
this memory is transmitted to the resulting process ΔU on the shape and the duration 
of its pulses. 
 
5.2.  Self-similar average periodic structure 
 
Fig.3A  represents  the  resulting  process  U  due  the  superposition  of  five  similar 
single-sided  originating  RTSs  of  amplitude  u.  The  process  U  has  the  following 
properties, when the number of the originating RTSs is high: 

•  The  coincidences  self-organize  symmetrical  graded  pulses  of  triangular 

shape, which amplitudes change for the quantity u, or multiple of u. 

•  The  fluctuations  ΔU  from  the  mean  <U>  obey,  in  general,  to  a  Gaussian 
distribution  and,  as  a  consequence,  also  the  maxima  of  the  pulses  ΔU  will 
obey to the same distribution.  

•  The  time  series  of  the  maxima  of  the  pulses  ΔU  of  the  same  amplitude  is 
phased on the time series of the maxima of immediately minor amplitude and 
so on.  

•  If  the  maxima  of  the  pulses  ΔU  obey  to  a  Gaussian  distribution,  also  the 

corresponding fluctuations Δc obey to the same distribution (Sec.5.1).

 In  Fig.4  it  is  represented,  for  sake  of  simplicity  and  necessity  of  scale,  the  self-
similar periodic average pattern which obeys to the distribution

the  fluctuations  scales  averagely  according  to  the  series  1/2,  1/4,  1/8,  1/16,  …, 
otherwise using Δc2 the series would have been 1/2, 1/4, 1/16, 1/256, … .  
 The pattern of Fig.4 recalls the so-called Voss-McCartney algorithm generating 1/f 
noise  [15]  and  it  is  reminiscent  of    an  one-dimensional  Sierpinsky  signal  whose 
structure can generate 1/fα spectra [16]. 
 In conclusion, the self-similar structure of the fluctuations ΔU can be intended only 
averagely. Indeed, a structure merely periodic would be generate  a discrete power 
spectrum  and  it  is  meaning  that  Voss-McCartney  algorithm  can  be  improved  by 
adding a white noise source [15].

6.  1/f  power spectrum  
 
Various  versions  of  the  model  of  the    superposition  of  many  similar  single-sided 
RTSs  can  be  adopted  to  demonstrate  the  presence  of  1/f  power  spectrum  on  the 
resulting  process. 
  Indeed,  facing  a  general  version  (sum  of  independent 
Lorentzians) other versions are possible, based on particular statistical aspect of the 
resulting process.  
 
6.1.  Sum of independent Lorentzians  
 
It  is  known  that  a  weighed  summation  of  Lorentzians,  with  a  distribution  of 
-1, yields a 1/f power spectrum. Indeed,

 Although  the  Lorentzians  of  Fig.3C  generate  the  process  of  Fig.3A,  the  power 
spectrum of the resulting process cannot be built by a simple weighted summation of 
these Lorentzians (using their variance), because the resulting pulses are obtained by 
coincidences  and  in  this  sense  the  cross-correlation  term  cannot  be  negliged. 
Besides,  the  variance  of  these  Lorentzians  is  not  inversely  proportional  to τ,  but 
rather directly proportional.   
 Therefore, the appearance of 1/f power spectrum requires adjunctive characteristics 
in  the  resulting  process,  such  as  the  emersion  of  coincidences  which  phase  the 
fluctuations  of  the  process  itself  (Sec.5).  Hence,  looking  to  the  time  series  of  the 
phasing times (or relaxation times) of the resulting process, we can decompose this 
sequence in various independent Lorentzians with a distribution of relaxation times 
(see  example  in  Fig.2).  The  variance  of  these  Lorentzians  is  just  inversely 
proportional  to  τ,  due  to  the  rarity  of  the  fluctuations  with  the  increase  of  the 
relaxation time.  
 Supposing  a  continuous  distribution  of  relaxation  times,  the  power  spectrum S(f)U 
has  to  be  averaged  over  this  distribution  with  a  function  weight  p(τ)  dτ  ∝  1/τ  dτ, 
which includes the contribution to the variance of processes whose relaxation time 
lies in the interval from τ to τ + dτ .  
 The  cross-correlations  terms  do  not  appear  in  the  superposition  of  these 
Lorentzians, because these terms simply do not exist, being the Lorentzians derived 
by decomposing a resulting process and not vice versa.

6.2. Point process model 
 
This model can be considered as a particular case of the sequence of  phasing times 
of the resulting process due to the coincidences of many similar single-sided RTSs, 
mentioned  in  Sec.5.  Indeed,  this  sequence  can  appear  without  interruptions  and  in 
this circumstance, the occurrence times tk , of the maxima of the resulting pulses, can 
be described by the recurrent equations [11][16]

where γ  is a number << 1 representing the average strength which approaches τk to 
the  average  value  τ,  while  {εk}  denotes  the  sequence  of  uncorrelated  normally 
distributed  random  variables  with  zero  expectation  and  unit  variance  (white  noise 
source) and σ  is the standard deviation of the white noise. 
 Eqs.  (21)  exhibit  an  autoregressive  process  with  very  small  damping,  in  the  sense 
that when τk-1 is different from τ it  is adjusted to be more (normally distributed) near 
to τ.  
After some algebra, and in the frequency range f1 < f < f2, fτ , being f1 = γ3/2/πσ, f2 = 
2γ1/2/πσ, fτ =  (2π τ)-1, a 1/f spectrum is obtained from the series of the times tk.  
 This  model,  based  on  a  self-adjusting  average  periodicity  of  occurrence  times  tk, 
depends only on statistics and correlations of occurrence times tk, because the shape 
of pulses mainly influence the high frequency power spectral density [11][16].  
 We  can  also  to  note  that  processes  as  a  pure  periodic,  or  Poisson,  can  be  easily 
excluded, as also a perturbed periodic process, expressed by the recurrent equation 
τk = τ +σεk,  due to the infinite Brownian increase or decrease  of the intervals τk .  
 
6.3.  Gaussian model  
  
A Gaussian noise not necessarily has a 1/f power spectrum, but not even it excludes 
its  presence.  Gaussian  noise  concurs  to  1/f  power  spectrum  when  the  resulting 
process assumes the aspect of a self-similar periodic average signal (Sec.5.2). In this 
case, we can calculate the power ΔU2
 

  from Eq.(18), that is

 where  ΔU 
probability P(ΔU) in the measurement time T. Indeed, if each measurement requires 
the time ΔT, various values of power can appear with the same probability P(ΔU), 
on  T/ΔT  alternatives.  On  the  other  hand,  the  law  of  large  numbers  allows  us  to 
introduce  rates  (average  number  of  events  in  time  unity)  in  the  place  of

probabilities, thereby enabling us to substitute the probability P(ΔU) with  the rate 
rΔU = P(ΔU)/ΔT.   
 Therefore, Eq.(22) becomes

 denotes the average power of all the fluctuations of rate rΔU .  
where 
  If the average structure of  process ΔU  tends to become periodic on any frequency 
scale  (self-similar  structure),  the  various  rates  rΔU    tend  to  become  discrete, 
assuming the meaning of frequencies fΔU. So,

of all the fluctuations of frequency  fΔU or, in other words,  of  all  the  fluctuations

Now, the periodic average process ΔU,  of fundamental frequency fΔU , has spectral 
components in the frequency range    fΔU , fmax (the half of the sampling frequency) 
and its average power is just the summation of the powers of its harmonics [17].  
 Hence,  supposing  a  continuous  distribution  of  the  spectral  components,  we  can 
introduce the power spectrum S(f)ΔU,  so that the power increment, in the frequency 
interval

In conclusion, tanks to a periodic average self-similar structure, a Gaussian process 
can generate 1/f power spectrum.       
 Vice  versa,  the  1/f  power  spectrum  of  a  self-similar  and  periodic  process  ΔU,  
conducts to a Gaussian distribution. Indeed, the average power of the fluctuation ΔU 
in the frequency range fmax , fΔU , will be

 represents the average power of the process ΔU in the period 1/fΔU.  

 
where 
The Gaussian distribution of 1/f noise is found in measurements performed by R.F. 
Voss  on  different  solid  state  devices  [18].  In  particular  R.F.  Voss  tested  the 
correlation between Gaussian behaviour and 1/f noise observed in a sufficiently pure 
form. 
 
6.4. “Running” sand-pile model 
 
 It is not difficult to translate the generation of coincidences, due to the summation 
of  many  single-sided  RTSs,  in  a  version  of  the  SOC  (self-organized  criticality) 
model  [19].  Indeed,  we  can  adopt  the  continuous  one-dimensional  version  of  the 
SOC, that is the so-called “running” sand-pile model [20], also described with new 
analyses and signatures in the reference [21]. 
 The basic model consists of a one-dimensional lattice of L cells. The boundary of 
the  lattice  at  n=  0  is  closed,  while  at  n=  L  is  open.  Each  cell  contains  an  integer 
number of sand grains which represents the height of the cell.  
 To  every  cell  n  is  associated  the  local  gradient  zn  representing  the  difference  in 
height between two neighbouring cells. 
 The  transport  process  is  initiated  by  randomly  depositing  sand  grains  into  the 
system. At each time step, there is a probability p of depositing N0 grains of sand to 
each site. The system can started from uniform or random conditions. 
 The configuration zn is simultaneously updated according to the following evolution 
rules

if and only if 
 After some time, the system reaches a steady state in which the input is on average 
balanced by the drainage at the open end.  
The  local  gradient  zn  represents,  in  our  case,  an  RTS,  random  switching    from  the 
value zero to one, when zn ≥ Nf.  
 The activity of the system is the monitored by the total number c(t) of the unstable 
cells, or flips (the coincidences in our case), at each time step. The chain reaction of 
updates is referred to as an avalanche. 
The ingredient of the memory appears in the system when the sites are not updated 
in consecutive time steps. 
According to references [20][21], 1/f  noise on c(t) may arise as a consequence of  a 
suitable deposition rate of grains of sand andof a system size (L). This happens when 

 

11

the set zn mimes the set of single-sided RTS with the same amplitude, probability in 
up level and relaxation time.  In the case of ref.[20], it is interesting to note that the 
displayed waveform of the fluctuations of c(t) is just similar to that drawn in Fig.1A. 
 In conclusion, the running sandpile model, as concerns the generation of 1/f noise 
cannot be seen as a general physical model for 1/f noise, but as physical mechanism 
useful to generate a set of similar single-sided RTSs. 
 
 
7.  Conclusions 
 
  In this paper it has been demonstrated that 1/f noise is produced by a superposition 
of  many  single-sided  RTSs  with  the  same  amplitude,  probability  and  relaxation 
time. This result is possible thanks to:  
• 

The  presence  of  the  coincidences,  or  cross-correlations,  among  the  various 
originating RTSs. 
The self-adjusting periodicity of the fluctuations with various phasing times (or 
relaxation times). 
The  decomposition  of  the  sequence  of  these  phasing  times  by  a  set  of 
Lorentzians  with a distribution relaxation times. 

• 

• 

  Particular versions of this model are: 
• 

A  resulting  process  with  a  sequence  of  phasing  times  without  interruptions 
(point process model). 
A  resulting  process  with  a  self-similar  periodic  average  structure  (Gaussian 
model). 
The generation of a superposition of similar single-sided RTSs by a “running” 
sand-pile model.

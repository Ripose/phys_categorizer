Large-eddy  simulation  (LES)  is  a  well-established  numerical  technique,  which  resolves  the  most 

energetic  turbulent  fluctuations  in  the  planetary  boundary  layers.  Averaging  these  fluctuations, 

high-quality profiles of mean values and turbulence statistics can be obtained in experiments with 

well-defined initial and boundary conditions. Hence, the LES data can be beneficial for assessment 

and optimization of turbulence closure schemes. A database of 80 LES runs for neutral and stably 

stratified  PBLs  (DATABASE64)  is  applied  in  this  study  to  optimize  the  first-order  turbulence 

closure (FOC). Approximations for the mixing length scale and stability correction functions have 

been  tuned  to  minimise  a  relative  root-mean  square  error  over  the  entire  DATABASE64.  New 

stability functions have correct asymptotes describing regimes of strong and week mixing found in 

theoretical  exercises,  atmospheric  data  and  LES.  The  correct  asymptotes  exclude  the  need  for  a 

critical  Richardson  number  in  the  FOC  formulation.  Further,  we  analysed  the  FOC  quality  as

functions of the integral PBL stability and the vertical model resolution. We show that the FOC is 

never  perfect  because  the  turbulence  in  the  upper  half  of  the  PBL  is  not  generated  by  the  local 

gradients. Accordingly, the parameterized and LES fluxes decorrelate in the upper PBL. With this 

imperfection  in  mind,  we  show  that  there  is  no  systematic  quality  deterioration  of  the  FOC  in 

strongly stable PBLs provided the vertical model resolution is better than 10 levels within the PBL. 

In  agreement  with  previous  studies,  we  found  that  the  quality  improves  slowly  with  the  vertical 

resolution refinement. It is generally wise to not overstretch the mesh in the lowest 500 m of the 

atmosphere where majority of the observed, simulated and theoretically predicted stably stratified 

PBLs are located.

1. Introduction 

Modelling  of  a  planetary  boundary  layer  (PBL)  –  the  lowest  atmospheric  layer  with  significant 

vertical turbulent diffusion – is a challenge for meteorological simulations. Models need a kind of 

simplified  turbulence-closure  schemes  to  account  for  complex  physical  processes  and  to 

approximate strongly curved, non-linear mean vertical profiles of meteorological variables in this 

layer.  As  any  simplified  model  of  physics,  a  turbulence  closure  scheme  needs  validation  of 

assumptions  and  constraining  of  involved  empirical  constants  and  universal  functions.  This  has 

been  done  in  a  very  large  number  of  studies  involving  data  from  atmospheric  observations  (e.g. 

Businger et al., 1971; Louis, 1979; Businger, 1988; Högström, 1988) and more recently involving 

numerical data from large-eddy simulations (LES). A comprehensive benchmarking of the closure 

schemes  requires  a  data  set  covering  the  entire parameter  space  in  which  models  are  intended  to 

operate. Although recent observational efforts such as SHEBA (Uttal et al., 2002) and CASES-99 

(Poulos et al., 2002) provided relatively accurate data throughout the surface layer and sometimes 

the entire PBL, any direct intercomparisons are difficult to interpret. The difficulties are lurking in 

our inability to control the PBL evolution and its governing parameters. Therefore the performance 

of  parameterizations  in  the  benchmarking  considerably  depends  on  modellers’  skills  and 

understanding of the initial and boundary conditions in the test runs.  

In  these  circumstances,  the  benchmarking  against  LES  data  could  be  a  useful  exercise  as 

shown in pioneering works by Deardorff (1972) and Moeng and Wyngaard (1989). The LES data 

are advantageous as they provide the whole range of turbulence statistics throughout the entire PBL 

under  controllable  conditions.  Moreover,  the  LES  could  be  conducted  in  idealized  conditions, 

which are consistent with the background assumptions behind the closure schemes. It excludes the 

great  deal  of  irregular  discrepancies  between  the  closure  and  data.  The  latter  sometimes  requires 

4

fuzzy explanations referring to non-stationary, transitional and meso-scale phenomena recorded in 

the  atmospheric  data.  It  is  not  surprising  then  that  the  LES  data  look  attractive.  The  pioneering 

works  have  been  extended  in  a  number  of  following  studies  (e.g.  Holtslag  and  Moeng,  1991; 

Andren and Moeng, 1993; Galmarini et al., 1996; Xu and Taylor, 1997; Nakanishi 2001; Noh et al., 

2003).  The  most  recently  GABLS  –  GEWEX  Atmospheric  Boundary  Layer  Study  – 

intercomparison  study,  described  in  Beare  et  al.  (2006)  and  Cuxart  et  al.  (2006),  hereafter  C06, 

involved 11 different LES codes and 20 different turbulence closures. 

The  GABLS  is  a  case  study  however.  It  has  little  to  tell  on  changes  of  the  closure 

performance  across  the  parameter  space.  Ayotte  et  al.  (1996)  has  shown  that  the  closure 

performance can change significantly for neutral and convective PBLs. Their work was based on 

intercomparisons  between  10  LES  runs  and  corresponding  runs  of  7  single-column  models  with 

different turbulence closures. Up to our knowledge, a similar multi-case study has not been done 

yet  for  stably  stratified  PBLs.  This  is  perhaps  due  to  the  considerable  computational  cost  of  the 

stably stratified LES runs. Based on our experience, about two orders of magnitude more computer 

time is needed to obtain accurate LES data for a typical nocturnal clear-sky PBL as compared to 

time  needed  to  run  LES  for  a  truly  neutral  PBL.  This  is  due  to  strong  reduction  of  characteristic 

turbulence scales both internal and integral followed by the need of adequate mesh refinement and 

strong reduction of the model time step. 

 As  more  interested  in  climate  and  global  scale  applications  of  the  turbulence  closure 

schemes, we focus in this study on the first-order schemes (e.g. Holt and Raman, 1988). Although 

higher-order turbulence-closure schemes gradually become  more affordable in the meteorological 

simulations especially in meso-meteorological ones (e.g. Tjernström et al., 2005), the majority of 

global-scale models (e.g. five of seven operational models in C06) still rely on simpler, first-order 

closures (FOC).  

 

5

To study the FOC performance, a single-column model is usually initiated with more or less 

relevant  vertical  profiles  of  velocity  and  temperature.  Then  iterations  continue  until  a  quasi-

stationary  steady  state  solution  is  achieved.  In  this  model  state,  both  the  mean  variables  and  the 

turbulent  fluxes  differ  from  the  data  used  for  comparisons  as  C06  have  clearly  shown.  It  is 

therefore difficult to trace down reasons for differences and to identify a specific component of the 

FOC  responsible  for  the  deviations.  Here,  we  will  not  study  an  equilibrium  solution.  Instead  we 

will  test  different  components  of  the  FOC  against  data  from  a  LES  database  of  80  neutral  and 

stably stratified runs, hereafter DATABASE64. It is reasonable to expect that, given the stationary, 

steady  state  mean  profiles  for  the  wind  speed  and  temperature,  an  ideal  parameterization  would 

recover fluxes and tendencies similar to those from DATABASE64. Any discrepancy would be an 

indication of an internal inconsistency in the parameterization.  

 

The  performance  of  the  FOC  is  also  expected  to  change  with  vertical  mesh  resolution.  In 

C06,  the  performance  is  studied  at  resolution  of  6.25  m.  Realistic  resolutions  are  much  coarser. 

There are typically 2 to 4 model levels within the stably stratified PBLs in actual simulations. Such 

a coarse resolution could significantly alter the FOC performance as the closure relies on vertical 

gradients  computed  on  a  finite  mesh.  For  instance,  Lane  et  al.  (2000)  showed  considerable 

convergence of the single-column model results on consequently refined meshes to. More recently, 

Roeckner et al. (2006) reported significant improvement in representation of the near-surface high-

latitude  climate  with  resolution  refinement  in  the  ECHAM5  model.  Contrary,  C06  quoted  results 

fairly insensitive to the vertical resolution for the mesh spacing less than 50 m. Ayotte et al. (1996) 

results  suggest  a  way  to  resolve  this  contradiction.  They  showed  a  considerable  improvement  of 

accuracy  for  the  resolution  up  to  10  levels  in  the  PBL.  It  gives  the  spacing  of  about  50  m  for  a 

typical  conventionally  neutral  PBL  but  the  spacing  should  be  much  finer  to  resolve  a  long-lived 

stably stratified PBL (Zilitinkevich and Esau, 2003).

The structure of this paper is following. Section 2 describes the large-eddy simulation code 

and  the  database  DATABASE64.  Section  3  repeats  a  description  of  a  general  first-order  closure 

and  provides  details  of  the  optimized  FOC  fitted  to  DATABASE64.  Section  4  gives  the  FOC 

quality  assessment  over  the  range  of  stably  stratified  PBL  and  resolutions.  Section  5  discuss 

possible effects of non-local fluxes on the FOC performance. Section 6 outlines conclusions.  

2. Large-eddy simulation data 

Turbulence-resolving  simulations  have  been  conducted  with  the  Nansen-centre  large-eddy 

simulation  code  LESNIC.  The  code  solves  three-dimensional  momentum,  temperature  and 

continuity equations for incompressible Boussinesq fluid. It employs a fully conservative 2nd order 

central  difference  scheme  for  the  skew-symmetric  advection  term;  the  4th  order  Runge-Kutta 

scheme for time stepping; and a direct fractional-step pressure correction scheme for the continuity 

preservation. The computational mesh is the staggered C-type mesh, which demands only fluxes as 

boundary  conditions.  The  LESNIC  employs  a  dynamic  mixed  closure,  which  recalculates  the 

Smagorinsky  constant  in  the  eddy  diffusivity  part  of  the  closure  at  every  time  step.  Detailed 

description of the LESNIC was published in Esau (2004), intercomparisons – in Beare et al. (2006) 

and Fedorovich et al. (2004).  

The LESNIC has been used to compute a set of cases, referred to as DATABASE64 (Esau 

and  Zilitinkevich,  2006).  In  DATABASE64,  80  LES  runs  are  suitable  for  the  present  study.  All 

runs have been computed at the equidistant mesh with 643 grid nodes. The aspect ratio between the 

vertical and horizontal grid spacing varies from 1:1 to 1:4 with the majority of data computed at the 

1:2  mesh.  The  physical  resolution  varies  from  run  to  run  keeping  about  25  to  45  vertical  levels 

within the fully developed PBL.

The turbulent boundary layer comprised only 1/2 to 2/3 of the depth of the computational 

domain. This arrangement assures that the largest eddies, which occupy the entire PBL, were not 

affected  by  the  limited  horizontal  size  of  the  LESNIC  domain.  The  lateral  boundary  conditions 

were periodic in all runs. At the surface, the turbulent flux of potential temperature was prescribed 

and therefore it is considered in this study as an external parameter; whereas the turbulent flux of 

momentum  was  computed  instantly  and  pointwise  using  the  log-law.  With  these  boundary 

conditions,  turbulent  surface  flux  parameterizations cannot  be  evaluated  accurately  as  the  surface 

temperature has not been prescribed in the LESNIC but could be retrieved from the data only with 

some type of parameterizations.  

The vertical profiles of the mean variables and the turbulence statistics have been computed 

from 

instant  resolved-scale  fluctuations.  For 

instance,  a  vertical  flux  of 

the  potential 

temperature, θτ , is computed as

are  instant  values  of  the  vertical  component  of  velocity  and  the 

potential temperature at every grid node. The angular brackets denote horizontal averaging over the 

computational domain. The overbar denotes time averaging. All runs in DATABASE64 have been 

calculated for 16 hours of model time. Only the last hour was used for the time averaging. A sub-

grid  scale  flux, 

SGSτ ,  is  provided  from  the  dynamic  mixed  closure  employed  in  the  LESNIC. 

Comparing  DATABASE64  with  the  LESNIC  runs  at  1283  mesh  and  at  2563  mesh  (for  one  truly 

neutral case), we estimated that about 80% of the fluctuation kinetic energy and 65% of the vertical 

velocity variations at the first computational level were resolved. Thus, 

SGSτ is about 20% to 40% of 

θτ  at the first level and reduces with height.

A  prognostic  tendency  due  to  the  turbulent  flux  divergence  in  a  meteorological  model  (e.g.  Holt

(1) 

(2) 

(3a) 

where  ψ  is  one  of  prognostic  variables,  and  ψτ is  its  vertical  turbulent  flux.  To  avoid  model 

specific  details,  we  consider  the  closure  in  Eq.  (1)  as  applied  to  a  horizontally  homogeneous 

boundary layer of incompressible, barotropic fluid flow with a constant turbulent temperature flux 

at  the  surface.  Such  conditions  describe  realistic  shallow  stably  stratified  PBL.  The  vertical  flux 

ψτ is  parameterized  following  a  flux-gradient  assumption  (Businger,  1971;  Deardorff,  1972) 

through an eddy diffusivity,  ψK , and the vertical gradient of mean variables as 

Eddy diffusivity parameterizations generally follow Louis (1979) in construction of  ψK . There is 

however a rich variety of individual variations in different models. A general form reads

Another,  non-local  formulation  (e.g.  Troen  and  Mahrt,  1986)  based  on  predefined  shape  of  ψK -

data  suggest  that  the  stability  functions 

for  momentum  and  temperature  should  differ

θf

asymptotically as the ratio of the corresponding turbulent fluxes, known as the Prandtl number Pr, 

changes with Ri . However, there are no obvious reasons for  l  to be different for momentum and 

the temperature as it is often assumed in C06 parameterizations. 

3.2. Fitting of empirical functions 

There is a great variety of parameterizations for  ψf

 and  l  as they have been thought to be the best 

objects  for  modifications.  Surveys  of  the  proposed  functions  can  be  found  in  Holt  and  Raman 

(1988), Derbyshire (1999), Mahrt and Vickers (2003) and C06. It is interesting to determine these 

functions  and  to  assess  their  universality  using  data  from  DATABASE64.  An  original  concept 

behind distinction between  ψf

 and  l  was to use 

l =

)(zl

 to account for the eddy-damping effect of 

an  impenetrable  wall  (Nikuradze,  1933;  Blackader,  1962)  and  to  use 

f
ψ =

f
ψ

(Ri

)

  to  account  for 

the effect of the static stability (Djolov, 1973; Louis, 1979). We will refer here only to the original 

concept  excluding  from  the  discussion  the  existing  multitude  of  l   modifications,  which  involve 

stability  corrections  (e.g.  Mahrt  and  Vickers,  2003).  Figures  1  shows  the  mixing  length  scale 

obtained in truly neutral runs as

The  mixing  length  scale  is  indeed  universal  function  in  the  lower  half  of  the  PBL.  It  could  be 

approximated with a simple relationship following Blackader (1962) as

where 

41.0=κ

 is the von Karman constant. It is still used in many models. The best asymptotic fit 

of  Hl /0

to the DATABASE64 (Figure 2) is  Hl /0

= 0.3. This is surprisingly close to the empirical 

best fit in some meso-scale models (e.g. Ballard et al., 1991). It gives 100 m < 0l < 200 m for the 

near-neutral  PBLs,  which  includes  the  frequently  quoted  value  0l =150  m  (Viterbo  et  al.,  1999). 

The mixing length scale exhibits irregular fluctuations in the middle of the PBL. These fluctuations 

are  thought  to  be  due  to  the  inflection  point  on  the  velocity  profile  where  the  mean  velocity 

gradient is close to zero. It could be feature related to roll structures (Brawn, 1972) or the low-level 

jet  development  (Thorpe  and  Guymer,  1977).  Thus,  the  large  values  of  l   could  be  due  to 

inconsistency between the local flux-profile assumption and more complicated, non-local nature of 

the  PBL  turbulence.  As  we  will  see  much  of  the  FOC  inaccuracy  could  be  regarded  to  this 

inconsistency. To address literature on  0l (e.g. Weng and Taylor, 2003), we compute the following 

equation

where  E  is the turbulent kinetic energy and 

lC  is an empirical constant. Weng and Taylor cited the 

range 0.1 < 

lC < 0.25 from literature but argued that 

lC should be as small as 0.055. Using rather 

good  proportionality

  from  DATABASE64.  Such  a  large 

lC   would  require  retuning  of 

all  other  constant  in  the  turbulence  closures  since  it  is  one  order  of  magnitude  larger  than  the 

optimal value found by Weng and Taylor. 

Using the fitted mixing length scale from Eq. (5), one can compute the stability correction

These functions for momentum and temperature as well as their ratio, known as the Prandl number, 

are  shown  in  Figure  4.  The  presented  LES  data  behave  similarly  to  SABLES98  data  shown  in 

Yague  et  al.  (2006).  It  is  clearly  seen  that  popular  approximations  in  C06  are  in  rather  poor 

agreement  both  with  DATABASE64,  a  high-resolution  LESNIC  run  for  the  GABLS  test  case 

(Beare et al., 2006) and with theoretical considerations presented by Zilitinkevich (this issue). An 

empirical fit based on the bin-averaged DATABASE64 data reads

Where  ma = 21,  mb = 0.005,  θa = 10,  θb = 0.0012. Interesting that similar functions with exponents 

2−  and  3−  have appeared in Derbyshire (1999) study. These functions demonstrated physically 

consistent behaviour in equilibrium runs of a single-column model for the stably stratified PBL. No 

decoupling  between  the  surface  and  the  atmosphere  has  been  observed  even  at  the  strongest 

stabilities.  These  functions  in  Eq.  (8)  almost  perfectly  approximate  the  Prandtl  number  with  an 

inflection  point,  which  is  a  kin  to  the  critical  Richardson  number  in  the  Zilitinkevich’s  total 

turbulent  energy  theory  (see  this  issue),  at 

crRi =  0.15.  The  data  reveal  two  regimes  of  strong 

continues  turbulence  at  Ri < crRi and  weak,  probably  intermittent,  turbulence  at  Ri >  1  with 

transitional zone 0.1 <  Ri < 1. The higher resolution GABLS run (dark dots in Figure 4) provides 

data within the scatter range of the DATABASE64 but with some systematic deviations from the 

bin-averaged  values.  It  may  indicate  insufficient  resolution  of  the  DATABASE64  or  data 

dependence  on  evolution  of  the  capping  inversion  (the  layer  with  the  largest Ri ).  It  is  worth  to 

emphasise that the GABLS run was computed for 9 model hours while the DATABASE64 for 16 

model hours. Only the last model hour was used in this analysis.

Figure 4 discloses generous inconsistency between DATABASE64 and the formulations for 

the stability correction functions in the meteorological models. Small revisions of the Louis (1979) 

formulations  do  not  improve  the  approximations,  which  have  wrong  asymptotes  at  large  Ri   and 

therefore the incorrect Prandtl number.  

Figure 5 helps to determine value of the constants  ψC in Eq. (3b) for the non-dimensional 

gradients ψφ . Commonly cited values are between 4 and 7 (e.g. Högström, 1988). DATABASE64 

gives a rather certain estimation for momentum where 

uC = 5.9 (= 2.5 in terms of Zilitinkevich and 

Esau (2005) formulation). As expected from the Prandtl number behaviour, the constant  θC = 7.3 

does  not  fit  the  proposed  linear  dependence.  According  to  Zilitinkevich  and  Esau  (2005)  both 

constant should appear in Eq. (3b) where a generalized turbulence length scale is used instead of 

the surface Monin-Obukhov length scale. It is clearly seen that the linear approximation in Eq. (3b) 

for  the  temperature  non-dimensional  gradient  is  not  suitable.  Advanced  theory  (Zilitinkevich, 

personal communication) predicts quadratic dependence on the non-dimensional height.  

 

 

 

 

4. Quality assessment 

4.1. Quality dependence on turbulence structure 

Figure 6 shows vertical profiles of correlations between the FOC fluxes and the directly calculated 

fluxes  from  DATABASE64.  Correlations  at  a  few  lowest  layers  are  affected  by  the  prescribed 

surface fluxes.  Above this layer, there is generally good agreement between DATABASE64 and 

the FOC in the lower half of the PBL. The mean correlations are as large as 0.9 for all cases. The 

correlations deteriorate in the upper PBL with minimum of about 0.2 at the PBL top.  

Detailed analysis reveals that the temperature flux decorrelates only for the conventionally 

neutral  and  the  long-lived  PBLs  with  significant  temperature  inversions  at  the  PBL  top.  In  the 

13

inversion  layer,  even  small  eddies  are  able  to  entrain  a  considerably  amount  of  temperature 

fluctuations. This entrainment flux is not accounted for in the FOC. C06 showed that the majority 

of turbulence closures failed to develop even a relatively weak inversion in the GABLS case after 9 

hours  of  simulations.  The  correlations  remain  considerably  higher  in  the  upper  nocturnal  PBL 

where the entrainment flux is insignificant. The average correlation is about 0.8 for the temperature 

flux but 0.4 for the momentum flux. These results are in general agreement with Galmarini et al. 

(1998) conclusions. They demonstrated nearly perfect reproduction of a weakly stratified nocturnal 

PBL by a second-order turbulence closure in comparisons with two LES.

where  superscripts  “FOC”  and  “LES”  denote  the  fluxes  from  the  FOC  initiated  with  the  mean 

profiles  from  DATABASE64  and  the  fluxes  computed  directly  in  the  LES;   

zN is  the  number  of 

LES levels within the PBL and 

nz is the height of the nth level. After 15 hours of integration, the 

runs in DATABASE64 provide quasi-stationary, steady state mean variables and fluxes. Hence it is 

reasonable  to  expect  consistency  between  the  FOC  and  the  LES  fluxes  computed  from  the 

equilibrium temperature and wind profiles, i. e. 

. Figure 7 shows this is not the case. The 

0→RMS

ψε

error  does  not  depend  systematically  on  the  PBL  thickness,  which  is  an  integral  measure  of  the 

PBL  stability  (Zilitinkevich  and  Esau,  2003).  The  error  is  larger  only  for  the  cases,  which  are 

absolutely  dominated  by  the  entrainment  fluxes  from  the  capping  inversions.  These  cases  are 

particularly difficult for the FOC to reproduce. The minimum asymptotic error for DATABASE64 

 

 

14

is 

05.0>LESε

both  for  momentum  and  temperature  fluxes.  Existence  of  a  rather  large  minimum 

asymptotic error has also been found by Ayotte et al. (1996). 

4.3. Quality dependence on vertical resolution 

Such a fine vertical resolution as in DATABASE64 is unattainable in the meteorological models. 

The  practically  sounded  resolution  varies  from  4  to  7  levels  for  relatively  deep,  weakly  stratified 

PBL (Tjernström et al., 2005). The resolution deteriorates to a single level for polar long-lived and 

strongly stratified PBL (Cassano, 2001). Ayotte et al. (1996) found that 

LESε is reached in neutral 

and convective PBL at resolutions 

zN > 10. Our Figure 8 partially supports their conclusion. The 

error slowly decays with resolution refinement. The largest quality improvement is however seen in 

the  interval  10  < 

zN <  15.  To  obtain  Figure  8,  we  have  computed 

ψε for  a  number  of  regular 

RMS

meshes with inter-level spacing 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, 20 m, 30 m, 50m and 70 m for every run from 

DATABASE64. Then the average 

RMS

ψε for every 

zN was computed with subtraction of own LESε for 

every LES run.  

Another important aspect of the vertical resolution is a numerical approximation of strongly 

curved vertical profiles on coarse meshes using finite-difference numerical schemes. In majority of 

models,  calculations  of  the  FOC  require  calculations  of  the  vertical  gradients  with  the  2nd  order 

central differences as e.g. for the vertical flux divergence below

can notice that the operator  δ

z∇  introduces a negative relative error in the model tendencies within 

the  PBL  and  a  positive  error  immediately  above  the  PBL.    The  same  must  be  true  for  the 

Richardson number and for the fluxes. To keep the differentiation errors reasonably within 10% of 

accuracy, the model should have 

zN > 6.  

5. Discussion 

The presented technical data point out on an important role of non-local turbulent mixing within the 

stably  stratified  PBL.  It  seemingly  contradicts  to  the  commonly  accepted  hypothesis  that  the 

turbulent eddies in the stably stratified PBL are small and therefore their generation-dissipation is 

governed by the local gradients. In fact this local mixing hypothesis is supported only by data from 

the lower nocturnal PBL (Nieuwstadt, 1984) where the capping inversion is relatively weak. In this 

case the turbulence scale is limited by the local Monin-Obukhov length scale

 but 

16

 

 

 

the  PBL  thickness  is  larger  than  the  mean  eddy  size,  i.e. 

H<Λ

.  Zilitinkevich  (2002)  suggested 

that  in  many  cases  the  stability  of  the  free  atmosphere  imposes  stronger  limitations  on  the 

turbulence  scale  than Λ .  Zilitinkevich  and  Esau  (2002;  2003)  and  Zilitinkevich  et  al.  (2006) 

demonstrated  this  with  the  LES  data.  In  the  atmosphere,  the  cases  with 

H>Λ

are  frequently 

observed  in  mid-  and  high-latitudes  during  wintertime  where  the  strong  negative  radiation 

imbalance and the large-scale air subsidence in anti-cyclones play together to create and strengthen 

temperature inversions (Overland and Guest, 1991). A typical long-lived stably stratified PBL, as it 

has been observed at the SHEBA site in Arctic is between 100 m to 200 m thick and capped by a 

relatively  strong  potential  temperature  inversion  with  θz∇ ~  6  K  km-1.  It  is  rather  unusual  to 

observe (and very difficult to simulate) situations with 

H<Λ

under conditions with any significant 

wind speed.  

Following  Deardorff  (1972)  and  Holtslag  and  Moeng  (1991),  one  can  estimate  relative 

importance of the non-local, counter-gradient temperature flux in the stably stratified PBL as

This  measure  is  not  perfect.  It  just  attempts  to  fit  the  complex  turbulence  physics  to  one-

dimensional  flux-profile  theory.  Nevertheless,  it  clearly  shows  (see  Figure  11)  the  importance  of 

the non-local flux. The non-local flux dramatically increases for 

H<Λ

 both in the lower and the 

upper parts of the PBL. Moreover, the non-local flux in the upper PBL is always more important 

for  the  total  turbulence  mixing  than  in  the  lower  PBL.  Hence  DATABASE64  data  only  partially 

support  Holtslag  and  Boville  (1993)  assumption  that  θγ is  small  and  could  be  neglected  in  stable 

conditions.  

As we see it, the FOC fails due to two different physical reasons. Consider the flux in the 

FOC as multiplication of the three-dimensional eddy diffusivity characterizing the turbulent mixing 

and the three-dimensional mean gradient of a meteorological quantity. In one asymptotic regime of 

 

17

the  nocturnal  PBL,  the  gradient  is  created  through  the  turbulent  mixing,  which  compensates  the 

surface cooler temperature and the surface friction. Thus, the gradient is dependent on the mixing. 

The mixing is however suppressed as the strongest gradients are observed at the surface. Pressure 

variations and eddy interactions with the mean flow result in development of eddy activity in the 

layers  with  small  or  no  gradients.  In  this  layer  at  the  PBL  top,  one  can  observe  mixing,  as 

DATABASE64  shows,  which  is  considerably  stronger than it could be if it was simply imported 

from the lower layers. In fact the transport terms in the TKE budget are fairly small (~ 10-5 m2 s-3 

and  ~  10-6  K2  s-1)  in  the  upper  nocturnal  TKE.  In  another  asymptotic  regime  of  conventionally 

neutral PBL, the gradient is imposed through free atmosphere stability. Thus, the mixing, imported 

in the PBL top from lower weakly stratified layers, is stronger than the locally generated mixing. 

The TKE transport terms increase by factor 10 or in comparison with the nocturnal PBL. 

As  we  have  seen  the  PBL  top  and  the  capping  inversion  are  the  most  difficult  layer  to 

parameterize  in  frameworks  of  the  first  order  closure.  The  inversion  layer  is  important  as  in  the 

high-latitudes  the  fluxes,  especially  the  temperature  and  moisture  fluxes,  formed  in  that  layer, 

counteract  radiative  surface  cooling  and  fog  formation.  The  FOC  intrinsically  provides  too  small 

fluxes,  which  if  they  are  not  corrected,  would  allow  the  surface  temperature  drop  down  to  much 

lower values than it has been observed. In part, the flux enhancement disclosed in C06 is to prevent 

such a PBL decoupling from the surface (Derbyshire, 1999). Figure 12 provides intercomparisons 

between the LES and the FOC fluxes for several high-resolution runs. Small FOC fluxes in  Hz /

< 

0.05 are numerical artefact since no surface flux parameterization has been employed here. 

6. Conclusions 

 

 

 

In  this  study,  we  have  applied  the  large-eddy  simulation  database  DATABASE64  of  medium-

resolution (25 to 45 levels within the PBL) runs to optimize the simplest but still popular first-order 

18

closure and to assess its quality over a range of governing parameters in the stably stratified PBLs. 

The  analysis  has  been  also  supported  by  three  higher  resolution  LES  runs,  one  of  which  was  the 

GABLS run (Beare et al., 2006).  Our LES numerically resolve the most energetic fluctuations of 

velocity  and  potential  temperature.  It  allows  the  use  of  the  high-quality  quasi-stationary,  steady 

state mean profiles as input for the flux calculations in the FOC. The FOC fluxes were compared 

with directly computed turbulent fluxes from DATABASE64.  

To benefit from this approach, we optimized the elements of the FOC, such as the mixing 

length  scale  and  the  stability  correction  functions,  to  achieve  the  best  agreement  with  80  LES 

experiments  for  neutral  and  stably  stratified  PBLs  in  DATABASE64.  We  have  demonstrated 

general inconsistency of the traditionally used constants and universal functions with the LES data. 

New stability functions have been proposed. They correct asymptotes in the regimes of strong and 

week mixing in accordance with DATABASE64 and the recent development in turbulence theory 

and  observations  during  SABLES98  campaign.  The  correction  excludes  the  need  for  a  critical 

Richardson number.  

We  have  analysed  the  FOC  quality  as  a  function  of  the  vertical  model  resolution  and  the 

PBL  stability.  The  FOC  is  never  perfect.  The  reason  is  that  in  the  upper  PBL  the  mixing  or  the 

temperature  gradients  are  essentially  non-local.  Accordingly,  the  parameterized  and  LES  fluxes 

decorrelate  in  the  upper  PBL.  As  in  previous  studies,  we  have  shown  that  the  quality  improves 

slowly  with  the  vertical  resolution  refinement.  It  is  generally  enough  to  have  at  least  10  levels 

within the PBL to achieve the FOC accuracy close to the asymptotically possible. As even 10 levels 

would  be  too  costly  for  the  meteorological  models,  it  is  wise  to  not  overstretch  the  mesh  in  the 

lowest  500  m  of  the  atmosphere  where  majority  of  the  observed,  simulated  and  theoretically 

predicted stably stratified PBLs are located.  

Although  there  could  be  other  reasons  as  well,  we  speculated  that  the  common  flux 

enhancement  needed  to  run  the  models  with  the  FOC  is  originated  by  internal  model 

 

19

inconsistencies: the coarse vertical mesh, which smoothes vertical gradients; the overmixing in the 

lower  PBL,  which  biases  and  smoothes  the  mean  profiles;  and  undermixing  in  the  upper  PBL, 

which  reduces  the  warm  air  entrainment.  Thus,  to  satisfy  the  surface  energy  budget  in  the 

meteorological  models,  where  the  turbulent  flux  is  just  one  of  the  components,  the  FOC  should 

provide larger fluxes than it has been defined from the flux-gradient assumption.

uC –  for momentum (a) and  θC – 

for  the  temperature  (b)  non-dimensional  gradients  as  functions  of  the  height  normalized  by  the 

surface Monin-Obukhov length scale. Light dots denote DATABASE64 data for the lower 1/3 of 

the PBL with exception of the surface layer (1-2 computational levels in the LES). The bold lines 

are  the  mean  values  of  the  constants 

uC =  5.9  and  θC =  7.3.  It  is  clearly  seen  that  the  linear 

approximation for the non-dimensional temperature gradient is not suitable.

conventionally  neutral  cases;  (c)  –  averaged  over  nocturnal  cases.  High  correlations  near  the

Abstract 

 

We report on the performance of a Micro-Hole & Strip Plate (MHSP) electron 

multiplier operating in pure Xe, Kr, Ar and Ne at the pressure range of 1 to 6 bar. The 

maximal gains at 1 bar Xe and Kr are 5x104 and 105, respectively; they drop by about 

one order of magnitude at 2 bar and by almost another order of magnitude at 5-6 bar; 

they reach gains of 500 and 4000  at 5 bar in Xe and Kr, respectively. In Ar, the gain 

varies  very  little  with  pressure,  being  3-9  x  103;  in  Ne  the  maximum  attainable  gain, 

about 105, is pressure independent above 2 bar.  The  results are compared with that  of 

single- and triple-GEM multipliers operated in similar conditions. Potential applications 

are in hard X-ray imaging and in cryogenic radiation detectors.

1. Introduction 

 

Particular  interest  has  been  given  lately  to  gas  avalanche  electron  multipliers 

operating in noble gases and noble-gas mixtures. Relevant applications of such devices 

are in the fields of cryogenic detectors for neutrino physics, dark matter search and PET 

[1-4],  gas  photomultipliers  [5],  X-ray  and  neutron  imaging  [6,7]  etc.  The  very  simple 

high-purity  noble-gas  handling  and  their  low  aging  under  gas  avalanche  permit  the 

design  of  sealed  detectors  with  stable,  long-term  operation.  However,  charge 

multiplication  in  these  media  has  been  usually  strongly  limited  by  photon-  and  ion-

mediated  secondary  processes,  which  motivated  recent  studies  to  overcome  this 

drawback.  

Recently,  progress  has  been  made  in  high-gain  operation  of  multi-GEMs  (Gas 

Electron Multipliers) in noble gases and their mixtures, over a broad pressure range [7-

10].  The  avalanche  confinement  within  the  GEM  holes  effectively  hinders  photon-

mediated  secondary  processes,  allowing  for  reaching  high  gains  even  in  highly  UV-

emissive  gases  [11,12].  In  particular,  detailed  studies  have  been  carried  out  to 

investigate  the  performance  of  single-  and  triple-GEM  multipliers  operated  in  high-

pressure noble gases [8,13]. 

A  noticeable  drawback  of  micropattern  detectors  such  as  Micro  Strip  Gas 

Chambers  (MSGCs)  and  GEMs  is  the  gain  drop  at  elevated  gas  pressure,  which  is 

mainly due to the limited voltage that can be applied to the microstructure device before 

the discharge limit, and partly due to secondary photon- and ion-feedback effects. The 

only  exception  occurs  with  the  light  noble  gases,  helium  and  neon,  where  high  gains 

were  achieved  at  high  pressures  [8].  With  a  triple-GEM  detector  operating  in  heavy 

noble  gases,  Kr  and  Xe,  a  gain  drop  of  four  orders  of  magnitude  was  observed  when 

 

2

increasing the pressure from 1 to 5 bar [13], and gains below 10 were recorded at 5 bar.  

Gains  of  500  to  80  were  measured  in  pure  Kr,  using  a  single-GEM  multiplier,  for 

respective pressures of 1 to 10 bar [8]. 

The  recently  proposed  Micro-Hole  &  Strip  Plate  electron  multiplier  (MHSP) 

[14-16]  seems  to  be  very  adequate  for  the  operation  in  high-pressure  noble  gases.  It 

combines  GEM-like  and  MSGC-like  multiplying  elements  in  a  single  structure, 

resulting  in  two  successive  multiplication  stages:  hole  multiplication  followed  by 

anode-strip multiplication. The MHSP has good optical screening of avalanche photons 

and improved ion-blocking capability as compared to GEM [16]. It has fast signals [17] 

and good localization properties [15]; it can operate as a single-element detector or as a 

final amplifying element in a cascaded multiplier [15,16].  

The  first  attempts  to  operate  a  MHSP  in  Ar/50  mbar  Xe  mixtures  at  pressures 

between  1  to  7  bar,  yielded  maximal  gains  of  about  103  at  7  bar  [18].  The  maximum 

achievable gain did not show significant pressure dependence up to 6 bar, above which 

there  was  a  sharp  drop,  probably  due  to  some  discharge  limits.  Energy  resolutions 

between 14% and 16% FWHM were recorded with 6 keV X-rays, up to 6 bar. 

In  this  work  we  report  on  the  performance  of  a  single-MHSP  multiplier, 

operating in pure noble gases, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe, in a pressure range of 1-6 bar.  The 

results  are  compared  with  those  obtained  with  single-  and  triple-GEM  multipliers. 

Similarly to the results reported with triple-GEMs, the gain dependence on pressure is 

affected  by  the  gas  composition;  higher  gains  were  attained  at  high  pressures  in  the 

lighter noble gases [13].

2. Detector description 

The detector is located within a stainless steel vessel, 10 cm in diameter, having 

a 25-µm thick aluminized Mylar window, 2-mm in diameter, glued to the stainless steel 

with  a  low  vapour-pressure  epoxy  (Trac-Con  2116).  A  Macor  structure  supports  the 

MHSP  foil  and  carries  the  electrical  contacts  to  the  MHSP  electrodes.  The  various 

voltages were supplied through feedthroughs, glued to the stainless steel vessel with the 

same epoxy resin. The absorption/drift region and the induction region gaps, above and 

below  the  MHSP  multiplier,  respectively,  are  5  and  3  mm  wide.  The  detector  was 

vacuum  pumped  (10-5  mbar)  and,  then,  filled  with  noble  gases  at  different  pressures 

without  baking;  it  was  sealed  off  from  the  vacuum/gas-filling  system  during  the 

measurements.  The  gas  purity  was  maintained  using  non-evaporable  getters  (SAES 

St707),  heated  at  about  150ºC  and  placed  in  a  small  annex  volume  connected  to  the 

main detector volume. No gas aging was noticed trough all the experiments.  

The MHSP electrode, with an active area of 28 x 28 mm2, is made of a 50 µm 

thick Kapton with a 5 µm copper clad coating on both sides. The top surface has a GEM 

like  pattern  with  bi-conical  holes  of  about  40/70  µm  in  diameter,  arranged  in  an 

asymmetric  hexagonal  lattice  of  140-  and  200-µm  pitch  in  the  direction  parallel  and 

perpendicular to the strips pattern in the bottom side, with the holes centred within the 

cathode strips, ~100 µm wide, while the anodes, ~35 µm wide, run between them, in a 

200 µm pitch (see photograph in ref [17]).  

Within the present studies, the detector was irradiated with 5.9 keV X-rays from 

a 55Fe X-ray source with the 6.4 keV X-rays filtered by a chromium film. The primary 

electron  cloud  resulting  from  the  5.9  keV  X-ray  interactions  in  the  drift  region  are 

focused  into  the  holes  where  they  undergo  avalanche  multiplication  (Fig.1).  The 

 

4

avalanche electrons are extracted out of the holes towards the anode strips where they 

are further multiplied and collected. The signals from the MHSP anode strips were fed 

through  a  Canberra  2006  preamplifier  of  1.5  V/pC;  for  the  Ne  measurements  the 

sensitivity was reduced to 0.3 V/pC. The signals were further processed by a Tennelec 

TC243 amplifier (4 µs shaping time) and a Nucleus PCA2 1024 multichannel analyser. 

The electronic chain sensitivity was calibrated, for absolute gain determination, using a 

calibrated capacitor directly connected to the preamplifier input and to a precision pulse 

generator. 

All  the  electrodes  were  independently  polarized.  The  detector  vessel,  the 

radiation  window  and  the  induction  backplane  were  grounded.  The  voltage  of  the 

MHSP  top  electrode,  VTOP,  determines  the  drift  field;  the  voltage  difference  between 

this  top  electrode  and  the  cathode  strips,  VC-T,  determines  the  avalanche  gain  in  the 

holes; the voltage difference between the anode and cathode strips, VA-C, determines the 

avalanche  gain  around  the  anode  strips;  and  the  voltages  of  the  strips  determine  the 

induction field. 

 

3. Experimental results and discussion 

In each set of measurements at a given pressure, a maximum voltage across the 

holes, VC-T, and across the strips, VA-C, was established. Different combinations of these 

two values were experimented in order to maximize the gain, without reaching the onset 

of discharge. VA-C was, then, gradually decreased, while keeping VC-T constant. The 5.9 

keV  X-rays  pulse-height  distributions  were  fitted  to  a  Gaussian  superimposed  on  a 

linear  background  and  the  peak  centroid  was  monitored  as  function  of  VA-C.  For  each 

gas,  VTOP  was  increased  with  pressure  so  that  the  reduced  electric  field  in  the  drift 

 

5

region was only mildly decreased. Values in the range of 100-75 Vcm-1bar-1 were used 

for Xe, Kr and Ar fillings, and of 60-50 Vcm-1bar-1 for Ne fillings, respectively.  

In Fig.2 a-d, we present the detector’s total gain as function of the total voltage 

difference  applied  to  the  MHSP,  VTotal=VC-T  +  VA-C,  for  pure  Xe,  Kr,  Ar  and  Ne, 

respectively,  and  for  the  different  gas  pressures.  The  gain-curves  exhibit  the 

characteristic  exponential  avalanche  growth,  but  at  low  VTotal  values  the  pulse 

amplitudes  drop  faster  than  exponential,  due  to  inefficient  electron  transport  to  the 

anode  strips.  Fixing  VA-C  and  varying  VC-T,  instead,  the  slope  of  the  exponential 

variation of the gain is different but the maximal total gain achieved is the same. The 

VC-T values used for each pressure, were increased with increasing pressure from 460 to 

820V  for  Xe,  from  430  to  740V  for  Kr  and  from  320  to  660V  for  Ar;  for  Ne  we  set 

values around 320V for all the pressures, except 260V set at 1 bar.   

Fig. 2a,b, show an identical trend of the maximum gain dependence on pressure 

for pure Xe and Kr: a fast decrease of the maximum achievable gain from 1 to 2 bar and 

a  slower  decrease  of  this  maximum  for  pressures  above  2  bar.  Nevertheless,  the 

amplitude reduction with increasing pressure is much slower for Kr than for Xe. Gains 

about 5x104 and 105 were obtained at 1 bar for Xe and Kr, respectively, being reduced 

to  5x103  and  2x104  at  2  bar,  and  to  500  and  4x103  at  5  bar.  On  the  other  hand,  the 

maximum  gain  obtained  for  Ar  (Fig.2c)  presents  only  a  small  dependence  on  the 

pressure, increasing from ~5x103 at 1 bar to a maximum of 104 at 4 bar and decreasing 

by a factor 3 at 6 bar. The maximum gain achieved in Ne is fairly constant for pressures 

above 1 bar, being ~2x104 at 1 bar and ~105 for all the other gas pressures. 

Fig.3  summarizes  the  maximum  gain  achieved  in  the  MHSP  detector  as  a 

function of gas pressure for the different noble gases. For comparison, we include the 

maximum  gains  achieved  with  a  triple-GEM  [13]  and  a  single-GEM  in  Kr  [8]. 

 

6

Compared to the triple-GEM multiplier, the MHSP presents a much slower decrease of 

the maximum gain with increasing pressure, in Xe, Kr and Ar. The main reason for this 

difference  is  related  to  the  total  voltage  that  can  be  applied  to  the  multipliers  as  the 

pressure increases. 

The maximum operation voltage that can be applied to the MHSP is presented in 

Fig.4  as  a  function  of  the  pressure  for  the  different  gas  fillings,  together  with  the 

maximum voltage that can be applied across each GEM, in a triple-GEM mode [13] and 

in a single GEM, in Kr [8]. While in the MHSP the maximum applicable total voltage 

steadily  increases  with  pressure,  from  values  around  600  to  around  1100V  for  Xe,  Kr 

and Ar, the maximum voltage difference applicable across each GEM, in a triple-GEM 

cascade, saturates when the pressure increases above 2, 3 and 4 bar for Xe, Kr and Ar, 

respectively  [13].  This  last  effect  is  attributed  to  ion-induced  electron  emission, 

occurring in noble gases, due to ion feedback from the last to the preceding GEMs [7], 

which limits the maximum applicable voltage [13]. This effect is considerably reduced 

in single-element multipliers such as single-GEM [8] and MHSP. On the other hand, for 

high pressure Ne, the maximum applicable voltage is fairly pressure-independent, as in 

triple-GEM operating in Ne and He [13]. 

Studies  on  the  electron  avalanche  mechanisms  have  been  recently  performed 

[13,19,20].  For  Xe,  Kr  and  Ar  the  electron  avalanche  ionisation  is  determined  by  the 

electron-impact mechanism, which explains the maximum gain drop for high pressures 

as  the  maximum  applied  voltage  does  not  increase  as  fast  as  pressure  [13].  For  dense 

light  noble  gases  other  mechanisms,  such  as  associative  ionisation  and/or  penning 

ionisation with impurities, predominate over electron-impact ionisation [13,19,20].

4. Conclusions 

In  this  work  we  presented  the  characteristics  of  a  MHSP  electron  multiplier 

operated in Xe, Kr, Ar and Ne at pressures ranging from 1 to 6 bar. It was shown that  in 

most cases, this single-element multiplier yielded higher gains than those reached with 

single-  and  triple-GEM  elements.  This  could  originate  from  the  particular  MHSP's 

geometry;  the  two  amplification  stages  separated  by  only  a  few  tens  of  microns, 

resulting  in  a  more  efficient  electron  transfer  from  stage  to  stage  compared  to  that 

occurring in multi-GEM cascades [21]. 

The gas gain at 1 bar is about 5x104 for Xe, and higher than 105 for Kr. Xe and 

Kr show fast gain decay with pressure and the gains are reduced to about 500 and 4000, 

respectively, at 5 bar. For Ar, the gain variation with pressure is less marked; it varies 

between 3 and 9 x 103, with a maximum at 4 bar. In Ne, the maximum achievable gain 

increases from 2x104 at 1 bar to around 105 for pressures above 2 bar. 

At atmospheric pressure, the values reached with a MHSP are somewhat higher 

compared to a triple-GEM, except for Ar where the gains are lower by almost one order 

of  magnitude.  For  pressures  above  4  bar  the  MHSP  reaches  about  two  orders  of 

magnitude  higher  gains  than  the  triple-GEM.  In  Ne,  however,  the  gain  difference 

between  the  two  multipliers  is  reduced  with  increasing  pressure;  it  becomes  similar 

above 5 bar. 

Compared to a single-GEM operated in pure Kr, the MHSP yields gains that are 

more  than  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher,  at  1  bar;  the  MHSP's  maximum  gain 

decreases faster with increasing pressure, resulting in only one order of magnitude gain 

difference between the two at 6 bar.

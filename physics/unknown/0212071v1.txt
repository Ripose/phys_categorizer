Trapped particle bounds on stimulated scatter in

the large kλD regime

Harvey A. Rose*

Los Alamos National Laboratory

Los Alamos, NM 87544

In the strongly damped regime, the convective gain rate for stimulated scatter, κ, is

customarily maximized by requiring that, taken together, the laser light wave and the

daughter light and plasma waves, satisfy wavevector and frequency matching, and then

1/κ~γ, the plasma wave damping rate.  If the bounce frequency in the daughter plasma

wave is large compared to the trapped particle loss rate, it would seem, based on naïve

extrapolation of the work by Zakharov and Karpman (V. E. Zakharov and V. I. Karpman,

JETP 16, 351 (1963)) on decaying, one dimensional (1D) Langmuir waves, that κ may be

increased indefinitely by increasing the electrostatic wave amplitude, φ, since they

calculate that γ varies as φ  

−3/2

.  However, for a driven plasma wave in a laser speckle—as

is appropriate to stimulated Raman scatter in an optically smoothed laser beam in 3D—it

has been shown (H. A. Rose and D. A. Russell, Phys. Plasma, 8, 4784 (2001)) that γ

varies more slowly, ∝φ  

−1/2, and asymptotes to a finite value for large φ, when the loss of

trapped electrons due to convection out the speckle sides dominates that due to collisions.

This behavior, combined with the loss of resonance for φ too large, leads to a maximum

value for κ as a function of scattered light frequency and φ, for given laser and plasma

parameters. Bounds for stimulated Brillouin scatter gain rate are also obtained.  The

standard mode-coupling model (MCM) of these scattering processes, when modified to

include the trapped particle nonlinear frequency shift, always allows for a propagating

plasma wave, and therefore may be qualitatively in error in regimes where the daughter

plasma wave loses resonance.  A mean field approximation model is proposed which is

consistent with the bound on κ and agrees with the MCM in the resonant regime, but

differs in the non-resonant regime by respecting this fundamental difference in the

plasma mode structure.  If a plasma, as it evolves, crosses the resonant/non-resonant

regime boundary, a model that is cognizant of both regimes is required to avoid a

qualitative overestimate of the scatter.

 I. INTRODUCTION

Stimulated Raman and Brillouin scatter have long been considered as deleterious to the

achievement of inertial confinement fusion1.  A priori attempts at their control have either

relied on gain saturation by plasma gradients2, or given the large plasma scale lengths

anticipated for hohlraum targets at the National Ignition Facility1 (NIF), by large values

of Landau damping to keep the gain below the level at which thermal fluctuations may be

2

amplified to finite levels.  However, there is a concern that the effective damping may be

lower than classical (i.e., Landau damping), either as a result of ohmically modified

distribution functions3, or trapping effects, as evidenced by recent observations4 of

backscatter stimulated Raman scatter (BSRS), in conjunction with stimulated electron

acoustic scatter (SEAS).  This data strongly suggests that SEAS is beyond the ken of a

model that ignores electron-trapping effects on the electron acoustic mode.  Since the

Bohm-Gross (Langmuir wave) branch and electron acoustic branch of BGK modes

merge at short wavelengths (kλD  ≈ 0.53, where k is the wavenumber of the electron

plasma wave and λD the electron Debye length =1/kD), and since the anticipated NIF

parameter regime may straddle this wavenumber regime, both these branches and their

coupling need further study.

For the NIF, with a low Z (ionic charge) hohlraum plasma fill— a Helium-Hydrogen

mixture—and, at the peak of the laser pulse, an estimated electron temperature, Te, of 5

keV, ohmic effects on the electron distribution function appear to be a correction, and

will be ignored here.  The primary purpose of this paper is to present estimates as to how

large the BSRS and backward stimulated Brillouin scatter (BSBS) spatial gain rate

coefficients can get due to trapping effects.  The physical arguments behind these

estimates indicate that the standard mode-coupling model of these scattering processes,

when modified to include the trapped particle nonlinear frequency shift, may be

qualitatively in error when the daughter plasma wave loses resonance.  An alternative

model, which agrees with the former when there is a resonance, is introduced whose

validity does not require a resonant plasma wave.

where ε is the nonlinear dielectric function whose dependence on k, ω, and φ is described

below.  When the internal component of φ,  φ int,  φ = φ 0   + φ int, which is related to plasma

charge density fluctuations via Poisson’s equation, is determined by electrons, as in the

In this expression, the sign of “e” and the fact that φ is complex valued, count.  δne is the

It differs, in the linear regime, from the usually defined susceptibility by a sign and by

removing the explicit factor of (kλD) -2, which now appears in (1).

comparing resonances, i.e., solutions of Re(ε) = 0, for φ = 0 and finite φ.  However there

are various amplitude constraints.  One such constraint9 is based on ignoring the

anharmonic corrections to the self-consistent potential, whose accuracy requires that

λ .  On the nonlinear extension of the Bohm-Gross branch
k

(   v v

Dk≈ λ ), this is not very demanding.  Since (5) is a perturbative result, it must
1e

break down for large enough φ, although good accuracy has been attained for   e Te

φ  as

large as 1/2, for various special cases considered in [7].

With (5) in hand, one can address the question of nonlinear loss or resonance (LOR).  As

is plain from figures 1 and 2 in reference [7], as φ increases, the maximum value of kλD

for which a resonance is possible decreases.  Its squared value is the maximum of Re(Ξ)

over v.  For φ = 0 and Maxwellian f0, it is known10 to occur at kλD ≈ 0.53.

However, v/ve cannot be too small, or else (4) loses its physical validity, as explained

below.  This issue does not arise for electron dynamics alone since the use of this

expression for Ξ, equation (5), is usually in the context of “near BGK modes”, traveling

wave solutions of (4) with   

φ φ>>

0 , for which v/ve is order unity or greater.  If dynamic

6

ions are included, so that ion acoustic BGK modes are possible, then v/ve << 1 for these

modes, and the electron contribution to Ξ must be reconsidered.

Equation (4) is a one-dimensional surrogate for a full three-dimensional (3D) model.  In

3D, convection out the sides of a speckle in which Φ is localized, is explicitly included.

Instead of a relaxation term on the right hand side (rhs) of (4), the corresponding 3D

model has a “0”.  If v vanishes, and at infinity, f approaches f0, a Maxwellian, then on

general principles, the equilibrium solution is given by  −

.  Gone is the singular dependence on φ as

φ→0, the  φ term in (5), which obtains for finite v.  This dependence reflects the

mismatch—whose resolution occurs across the separatrix between trapped and passing

particle orbits—between f0, which in the frame of the wave depends on the kinetic energy

based on the relative velocity, ~ (u+v)2, while f, which is close to a BGK mode if

ν /ω b<<1, is based on the total energy, whose kinetic component ~u2.

For small v/ve, it is well known that the linear electron response has an imaginary part,

resulting in a small contribution to the damping of ion acoustic waves, which is ignored.

, which is only valid for ν /ω b<<1.  An

extrapolation of this result to the weakly trapped regime is presented in the next section.

There are two apparent differences between (6) and the result of Zakharov and Karpman

(ZK)11.  First, from dimensional analysis, if the relaxation of the distribution function is

diffusive,     D f∂ ∂2

v2 , as considered in ZK, then the natural dimensionless combination

for residual damping12 varies as    D φ3 2 , instead of ν ω ν φ

 as in (6).  Secondly,

and qualitatively more significant, there is the second term on the rhs of (6).  In reference

[7] it is obtained not as the next term in an expansion in powers of φ but rather via a mean

field approximation with

Since the magnitude of µ∆ is a lower bound13 for the damping in the strongly trapped

greater than about 0.3 for trapping to lead to a large damping reduction.  Since the

dependence of Ξ on k is through its dependence on µ, Ξ is but weakly dependent on kλD,

and therefore ε depends on kλD primarily through the explicit factor in (1), which

validates the utility of this representation.

C.  Evaluation of the imaginary part of Ξ in transition

Since (6) is singular as φ→0, and since for kλD ≥ 0.53 it will be shown that the maximum

gain rate for BSRS is attained for φ ≈  0, a smooth transition must be imposed on Im(Ξ) as

φ varies between the strongly and weakly trapped regimes.  The quasi-linear (QL)

approximation has been found7 to provide accurate values for Ξ, and is simpler to use

than the numerically exact methods.  The defining equations for QL theory, as applied to

the evaluation of Ξ for a coherent potential, are reproduced here from [7] for

later.  Since ε is given by (1) and (12), omitted from (14) are variations of ε due to

changes in the background density and temperature, which would otherwise detune the

“srs”(cid:1)”sbs”, (13) and the first equality of (15) are also valid for BSBS.  Diffraction,

refraction and light wave collisional damping have been ignored in the interest of

obtaining a gain upper bound.  Equations (14) and (16) (and the corresponding equation

for E0) constitute the mode coupling model17 (MCM).

In (14), the wavenumber and frequency arguments of ε, k and ω, are fixed but not

independent.  Equation (15) follows from the full wave equation only if ksrs and ω srs are

k

Since stimulated scatter tends to select the most responsive modes, the canonical choice

of k is such that the Langmuir wave (or electron acoustic wave) is resonant19, Re(ε)=0 for

φ  =  0.  More generally, one might choose k which maximizes the linear convective gain

(17)

rate, as given below in (19).

The gradient linearization, equation (14), is, at each spatial location, about the local value

of |φ |.  In general, the evaluation of   

∂ε ∂k  and ∂ε ∂ω yields a complex valued vL, but at

large phase velocities the real part is dominant and the complex part is ignored20.  This

breaks down near LOR where the electron acoustic and Langmuir wave branches merge

and  Re ∂ε ∂ω(

) → 0.  This regime is otherwise problematic in the framework of the

MCM because one pair (plasma wave and scattered light wave) is required for each

13

branch.  Since their properties approach each other near LOR, one expects their

amplitudes to be comparable so that neither may be ignored.  Unless their bounce

frequencies are small compared to their frequency separation, their effect on ε will not be

a mere superposition.  The dependence of ε on their amplitudes and phases is as yet

unknown in this regime.

A.  Gain rate upper bound

In the strong damping regime, one ignores spatial transport of the plasma wave, but

retains the time derivative so that gain as a function of frequency may be obtained.  It is

now assumed that if all the gain were lumped into a single, optimally chosen frequency,

this would give an upper bound, so that for this purpose, (14) is replaced by

εφ φ=
0,
 

and correspondingly the time derivative in (16) is dropped.  Equations (16) and (18) then

κ srs /k0 depends on the laser and plasma parameters, ne/nc, vosc/ve, Te, besides k/kD and

eφ/Te.  It also depends on ν /ω p.

Since the dependence of κ srs on laser intensity, I ~ (vosc/ve)2, is simply multiplicative, one

must take care, once its maximum value is determined, that the intensity is not so large as

to violate the strong damping approximation: it is required that21 vLκ srs << ω ε

p Im .  If

this inequality is violated, the error in the use of the strong damping approximation may

be large: a generalized absolute (self-sustaining) instability might be induced by trapping

effects, even if the intensity is well below the linear absolute threshold.

B.  Comparison with time dependent solutions

Numerical solutions of the MCM are presented to show the utility and relevance of the

upper bound theory.  φ (Esrs) is taken to vanish at the left (right) side of the simulation

region since vL> 0 (vsrs< 0).  vosc is assumed constant, as pump depletion should not lead

to an increase of reflectivity.  A thermal source is added to the rhs of (14), which is a

delta correlated complex random field whose amplitude is chosen to yield the appropriate

level of scatter for small laser intensity.  For the illustrative choice of plasma parameters,

ne/nc = 0.05, 1/2µm light, and Te=1keV, this noise results in a reflectivity which increases

linearly with distance at the rate ≈ 5E−12/µm.  ν /ω p= 0.005, a typical value, and the

dependence of the maximum gain rate on this parameter is briefly studied later.  Various

cases are now considered with ne/nc and laser intensity as parameters.

The actual reflectivity has complex time dependence22, though apparently statistically

stationary, so it is natural to compute the time average reflectivity, <R >, and compare the

maximum value of  0 5.

100 ps of evolution from quiescent initial conditions, time averages are accumulated over

the next 400ps.  Since no low frequency plasma response is allowed in this model, which

SRS, long time transients are not expected.

exponentially so that even in a small neighborhood, e.g., consider that range of z where

the gain rate is within 1% of its maximum, it is found that their values cover a substantial

range, 0.0002<R <0.0006 and 0.01<φ <0.02.  Therefore, their precise values at the

FIG. 5.  Amplitude of φ at z=170µm, where the average gain rate is a maximum.

φ’s time variation at the inflection point is shown in figure 5.  It is remarkable that such a

complex process is closely bounded by an estimate that ignores explicit time dependence:

the bound exceeds the actual maximum value by only 50%.  Part of the reason for this

may be interpreted as being due to the insensitivity of κsrs to φ, as shown in figure 3, for

values of eφ /Te greater than about 0.01.

κ
While there is no expectation that     

max

srs  can accurately represent κsrs globally, and

therefore cannot be used to make a reliable estimate (except in the upper bound sense) for

the reflectivity, it is gratifying to note for the above example that although <R > increases

18

by a factor of 100 between the spatial location where κ attains its maximum and the left

hand boundary of the simulation domain, the gain rate decreases by only 24%.

When I is increased by a factor of 10 to 4E15 W/cm2, length and time scales decrease,

and the gain rate bound is still valid, although a bit closer to that based on the time

averaged reflectivity:  0.18/µm vs 0.13/µm and there is little change in the simulation

results if the convective term is omitted from (14): instead of 0.13/µm, the maximum

gain rate is reduced to 0.12/µm.  As the remaining cases will be at lower density, where

the strong damping approximation is expected to have a greater domain of validity, this

convective term will henceforth be dropped.

At lower densities, beyond LOR for the Langmuir wave, there emerges a discrepancy

between the upper bound theory and the MCM.  The reason for this is discussed in the

next section, but first two examples.  If the density is reduced to 0.025 of critical, with

(
other parameters the same as the previous example, it is found that  κ

time average maximum gain rate is 0.025/µm: so far, so good.  But when the density is

eφ / Te=0.003 and ν /ωb = 0.16, so that

C.  Failure of first order mode coupling theory near loss of resonance and an

alternative theory—the mean field approximation

 The significant omission from equation (14) is the failure to retain higher order time

derivatives, since near LOR, the real part of the susceptibility is near a maximum as a

function of v, and therefore so is ε as a function of ω.  As given, the time derivative term

)
in equation (14) has the potential for precisely compensating any change in  Re ε ∂ε ∂ω

(

due to a fluctuation in φ simply by allowing φ to evolve at the corresponding frequency,

i.e., the first order MCM allows arbitrary amplitude resonant waves.  However, as shown

in [7], for given k there is a finite value of φ beyond which waves cannot be resonant23.

Therefore a model based on the linear frequency interpolation of the dielectric function,

such as (14) (equivalently, see (20) below), is unreliable even for small amplitude waves

near LOR, e.g., near kλD ≈ 0.53.

For yet larger kλD the use of such a model is more problematic because there is still the

possibility of resonance for any φ, while the actual dynamics in this regime is such that

resonance is not possible even for small amplitude waves, and the larger φ, the further

from resonance is the plasma response.  Deep into this regime, trapping decreases the

gain rate, contrary to the prediction of the MCM.

κ
This is illustrated in the following two figures that show

The two curves join at φ  = 0 because of the choice of kenv.  Although a Langmuir

resonance is not possible at   k D

λ = 0.57, the solid curve first increases slightly with φ

before decreasing because the plasma is driven near resonance and the cost of being

slightly further from resonance due to trapping is offset by the larger decrease in damping

due to trapping.  The MCM result (dashed curve) departs dramatically from the full

theory (solid curve) for small φ  : it is too large by a factor of 2 for φ  = 0.0035.

FIG. 7.  As in figure 6 except at the higher density,   n ne

resonance is possible until φ  = 0.05, at which point the two theories begin to sharply

diverge.  For   n ne

c  = 0.15, a resonance is possible even for φ > 0.5, and over the range of

φ shown in figure 7 the agreement between the two theories is excellent.

When a resonance is possible, the maximum gain rate varies as   1 ν, and is found to be a

relatively insensitive function of this parameter otherwise.  The solid curve in figure 6 is

essentially unchanged when ν is increased to 0.01, while the MCM result decreases to

about 0.02 at φ = 0.02: the two theories are in better agreement.  For the   n ne

c  = 0.1 case,

the full theory result is diminished for small φ, when a resonance in possible, but not at φ

23

= 0.2, while the MCM value for κ is reduced by a factor of 2 at φ = 0.2.  Again it is found

that the increase of ν results in better agreement between the theories.

While it is beyond the scope of this paper to study the model obtained by retaining the

second order time derivative term, the following model, which is non-perturbative in

frequency, is a natural generalization of the first order model, equation (14).  Fourier

transform (FT) (14) in time, let δω be the frequency variable, and take the strong

damping limit so that the convective derivative is omitted.  Multiply through by ∂ε ∂ω,

in effect deconstructing the formal manipulations that led to (14) in the first place, to

obtain

, its logarithmic derivative cannot exceed that of any of its

components, and therefore the gain rate upper bound determined by (19) cannot be

violated by (22).  Equation (22), the MFA model (MFAM), may be viewed as a

generalization of the basic MCM which, unlike the latter, is valid in the regime where the

daughter SRS Langmuir wave is near or past a loss of resonance. The breadth of the

spectrum, ∆ω, is limited, however, if the dependence of ε on φ rms is to be accurately

given as if φ were a coherent wave.  The estimate, ∆ω < ω b, is also a constraint on the

MCM.

Note that the generalization24 of (22) to higher dimensions is straightforward through the

addition of diffraction, refraction and the dependence of ε on slow variations in the

plasma density, while the generalization of (23) is not because of diffraction.  Unless the

density fluctuation is slowly varying, it may couple the SRS daughter plasma wave to

others.  For example, if this wave is unstable to a decay process, then another component

to the plasma wave response must be explicitly included.

The validity of the MFAM’s bound prediction may be determined by comparison with

first principle kinetic simulations.  Since Ξ and therefore the gain rate bound explicitly

depends on f0, the background distribution function, and since long time, multi-

25

dimensional (multi-D) evolution will lead to its modification25, this comparison is

nontrivial in higher dimensions.  Also, quantitative comparisons call for a re-evaluation

of  Ξ based on transversely localized multi-D Vlasov traveling wave solutions26.

D.  Comparison of the two models

The MFAM will now be compared with the MCM, starting with case “A”. The MCM is

expected to be well within its domain of validity since the optimal wavenumber and

potential amplitude are found to be kλD = 0.332 and eφ /Te= 0.24, while at the nearby

wavenumber kλD =  0.338, with constraint (17), one finds the maximum value of φ

consistent with a resonance is at eφ  /Te= 1.04, both of which greatly exceed the observed

fluctuations in φ : at the spatial location of maximum average gain rate, the time series

generated by the MCM has eφ rms/Te = 0.013, with a maximum value, over 400ps of

observation, of only 0.056.  Both models are found to have the same peak amplitude gain

rate of 0.012/µm, although the MFAM takes longer to get going, attaining its peak value

at z =73µm, which is 100µm beyond where the MCM attains its maximum27.

One way to put this spatial shift in perspective is to note that the gain rate only changes

by 10% over this 100µm.  Another is to study the sensitivity of these results to the

thermal noise source.  A thermal source term has been added to the rhs of (22) whose

magnitude is chosen to give the same level of Thomson scatter as in the MCM.  Its

frequency content is determined as in the former case:  a Lorentzian centered about the

linearly SRS matched frequency, and a width determined by linear Landau damping.  If

the noise source is doubled in the MFAM (i.e., double the Thomson scatter), there is a

26

50µm shift in the location of the maximum gain rate towards larger z, which brings it

closer to the MCM result.  On the other hand, if the noise source in the MCM is halved,

the location of its peak gain rate is shifted by 60µm towards smaller z, closer to the

MFAM result.  Therefore the 100µm shift in the location of peak gain rate, between the

MCM and MFAM with the same level of thermal fluctuations, is not viewed as

physically significant since it can be compensated for by modest changes in noise levels,

a point well worth reconsidering if comparisons are made with particle simulation results.

For case “B”, the predictions of the models are qualitatively different.  The MFAM yields

a maximum amplitude gain rate of 0.01/µm, which is below the predicted upper bound,

0.013/µm, and well below the overactive MCM rate of 0.018/µm. Also, since the MCM

is a nonlinear model, it is possible that its maximum gain rate may be even larger when

there is a finite BSRS seed.

 decreases by a factor of six.  Thus, there is a large

potential advantage in controlling BSRS by such a change in density, much larger than

suggested by linear theory.

Also shown in these figures is the 2.5keV case, corresponding to the regime attained in

certain NOVA experiments32, which attempted to determine a low-density cutoff for

BSRS in a hohlraum environment.  No cutoff was found, with the average reflectivity a

31

maximum at the lowest density studied, 0.06nc.  For this lower temperature case, LOR is

not until about 0.05nc, so that the gain can be enhanced significantly by trapping effects

at 0.06nc: the ratio of maximum nonlinear gain rate to linear ≈ 4.

(
At 0.07nc and 5keV,  κ

)

srs
norm

max

 is 0.0116, which is essentially the linear classic estimate.

For 0.35µm laser wavelength and an intensity of 2x1015W/cm2, (vosc/ve)2 ≈ 0.018, and

κ
therefore     

max

srs ≈ 0.0037/µm.  Since for these plasma parameters, a linear amplitude gain

coefficient of about 10 is required to boost thermal fluctuations to order unity, this gain

rate would need to be maintained over 2.7mm before BSRS can be significant.  This

maximum is at   e Te

φ = 0.0016, kλD = 0.581, v/ve=2.3.

The 2.7mm length scale estimate is upset, however, by the large intensity fluctuations

inherent to random phase plate (RPP) optics, where now, e.g., 2x1015W/cm2 is the

average laser intensity, <I >.  In particular, a linear model of stimulated scatter in the

strongly damped regime, for which the field fluctuations are taken to be Gaussian—as it

would be in a quiescent plasma—shows that these fluctuations can lead to a reflectivity

divergence33 over a finite plasma slab once <I > exceeds a critical value, Ic, which may be

qualitatively estimated for a homogeneous plasma by requiring that, for I = Ic, a power

gain coefficient of unity obtains over a speckle length≈7F2λ0, or about 150µm for f/8

κ
optics.  The value     

max

srs ≈ 0.0037/µm, in fact, yields just about such a gain exponent.

Quantitative estimates of Ic for BSRS in a hot spot field would be useful since the

previous calculation33 was for BSBS, for which the backscattered light has essentially the

32

same wavelength as the laser, making the latter a more efficient process than BSRS.  In

addition, propagation over several mm of plasma tends to degrade the laser beam’s

spatial coherence, without significantly changing the distribution of hot spot (speckle)

intensity34, if the optic temporal bandwidth is large enough to suppress self-focusing,

effectively shortening the speckle length and thus raising the value of Ic.  Both these

effects raise the critical intensity threshold over the simple estimate of the preceding

paragraph.

BSBS

IV. LOSS OF RESONANCE FOR ION ACOUSTIC WAVES AND

 

When ion dynamics is allowed, it is well known that at low frequencies there are linear

ion acoustic modes.  Less widely appreciated is the fact that35 their nonlinear extension to

BGK modes has a LOR as various parameters are varied.  Besides kλD, there are the ionic

composition and electron to ion temperature ratio, Te  /Ti, which may be varied.  Just as in

the case of the Langmuir wave LOR and BSRS, the ion acoustic LOR will separate

qualitatively different regimes of BSBS.

A.  Ion acoustic loss of resonance

The nonlinear susceptibility (defined so that φ  = φ 0/ε still holds but now the external

potential, φ 0, acts on all species) may be expressed as a weighted sum of the previously

The values of i run over the number of ion species.  Zi is the i’th species charge state and

ni its average number density.  Ti , vi and γi are the corresponding background ion

temperature, thermal speed and trapped ion escape rate respectively, and µi = γi /kvi .  If

each γi is determined by a speckle width thermal ion transit time, so that γi ~ vi, then all

the µi are identical to each other and, at low density, close in value to µ, the

dimensionless trapped electron escape rate relevant for BSRS.

In the linear limit, each Ξi reduces to     

′Z 2 when f0 is Maxwellian, as in (3), but with

argument  v v

.  Instead of searching for complex frequency roots of ε = 0, the

resonances, Re(ε) = 0, for real k and ω, are sought, as in [35], to find the dispersion

relation of small amplitude BGK modes.

It is sufficient to search for LOR in the linear regime to illustrate the rich structure of

LOR as a function of the various parameters, so that for this purpose

It follows that if a single ion species is to have a chance of a resonance, then35

function.

0.285Θi >1, or ZiTe /Ti >1/0.285 ≈ 3.5, since Zini = ne is the condition for charge neutrality.

If this inequality is satisfied then there are two resonances for small kλD, just as in the

pure electron case, but now Ξtotal passes through zero at two finite values of v, so that as

k → 0, the two resonances have finite phase velocity, i.e., there are two small amplitude

BGK acoustic modes.  This contrasts with previous36 37 studies of acoustic solutions to the

linear dispersion relation that apparently requires two ion species to have the possibility

of two weakly damped modes.

B.  Helium-Hydrogen plasma examples

In figure 13 the resonance phase speeds are graphed, normalized to the proton thermal

speed, vp, for Te /Ti =5 and two different Hydrogen fractions, fH=nH    /(nH+nHe) , as a

fH.  For example, if fH =0.5 then there is no resonance for kλD > 0.8.

For Te /Ti =2, there is no resonance at any wavenumber for fH greater than about 0.17,

while for Te /Ti =3 the cutoff is at about 0.5.  If Te /Ti  = 4, there is a hydrogen fraction gap,

from roughly 0.65 to 0.85, in which a resonance is not possible.

Ion acoustic LOR is much harder to come by for a C-H plasma, as seen in figure 15, even

for Te /Ti =2. The value of kλD for LOR is greater than one for fH = 0.5, a characteristic

value for methane like plasmas.

This has immediate implications for the competition between BSRS and BSBS.  Consider

a sequence of experiments in which the electron density decreases, e.g., a C-H plasma, as

in [32].  As per the discussion in section IV, when BSRS is lost, the value of kλD for its

daughter Langmuir wave is likely to be not much larger38 than 0.55, and since the

wavenumber for the BSBS daughter acoustic wave is at most twice this value, figure 15

implies that the plasma can support a nonlinear ion acoustic mode, even for a temperature

ratio as small as 2.  It would then be possible for BSBS to exceed linear estimates

because of trapping and perhaps win the competition with BSRS.  In contrast, a He-H

plasma with, e.g., a 60% hydrogen fraction and Te /Ti =3, cannot support a nonlinear

acoustic mode, even at zero wavenumber, and BSBS cannot be significantly enhanced by

trapping.

ν ia may be thought of as a normalized damping rate since in the linear regime with kλD→
0, for the case of a single ion species at its acoustic resonance, νia is the perturbative

expression for the ion acoustic amplitude damping rate, normalized to the ion acoustic
frequency.  As in the case of BSRS, one may seek the maximum of κsbs (minimum of ν ia)
for given laser and plasma parameters, by varying40 v and φ , with Ξ ion given by (25)  and

(26).

A.  Damping rate in the linear regime

As a warm up to the nonlinear maximum gain rate determination, consider the maximum
linear response. Figure 16 shows its dependence on Ti /Te and kλD for fH = 0.5, and figure

17 for fH = 0.7, in a Helium-Hydrogen plasma.  Although the linear response is similar in

these two cases, they are both shown by way of contrast with the nonlinear response,

discussed in V.B.

B.  Maximum response in the nonlinear regime for a Helium-Hydrogen plasma

Since a NIF hohlraum plasma environment is rich in possibilities, with time dependent

electron temperature, electron density, laser intensity, Te /  Ti and variable hydrogen

fraction, the following examples are chosen to illustrate different regimes of behavior, not

“representative” behavior. For all examples, µ=0.01.  Sensitivity of the results to this

choice is discussed later.  Other experiments involving plasma created in a He-H gas jet

have been proposed41 in which Te /  Ti is estimated to be as large as 8 for Te ≈1kev.

The first example has Te = 1keV, with Te /  Ti = 4, for which there is a qualitative difference

between the fH = 0.5 and fH = 0.7 cases, as seen in figure 18 which shows the normalized

Resonance is not possible for fH = 0.7, whereas it is possible over this range of densities

for fH = 0.5 (see figure 14).  This is consistent with the fact that the ratio of the responses

is much greater than would be inferred from the ratio of acoustic damping coefficients

computed in the linear regime, as in figures 16 and 17.  For this temperature and range of

densities, kλD varies between roughly 0.3 and 0.4.

43

Figure 20 shows the maximum normalized gain rate for different values of Te/Ti and

ne/nc=0.07 for the 1keV case. It may be seen that fH = 0.7 is about the best choice43 for the

purpose of minimizing the maximum gain rate, though it remains a sensitive function of

temperature ratio.

rates are the same for the fH = 0.7 case and almost the same for the fH = 0.5 case which

benefits slightly (a fraction of a percent) when finite φ is allowed at ne/nc=0.09 and 0.10.

A resonance is not possible for any of these higher Te cases.  Note the factor of 10 change

in scale between figure 18 and figure 22.  Now consider a more particular numerical

example which may be deemed appropriate to later times of a NIF laser pulse: the

parameters of figure 22, with I  =2x1015W/cm2, 0.07 critical density, and fH=0.7, yields

sbs ≈(2π/0.35µm) x 0.018 x 0.004= 0.0013/µm, which requires 7.7mm to come up from

thermal fluctuations.  That distance is halved by taking into account intensity

fluctuations, because these provide at least a factor of 2 enhancement over the gain based

on <I > since the backscattered light may be phase conjugate with the incident laser,

46

even if the laser’s spatial coherence is degraded due to propagation over a large plasma
length. This estimate does not vary much with µ:  it changes less than 1% as µ varies

from 0.005 to 0.02, as expected since this case is far from resonance.

 VI. SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The simplest predictor as to the importance of trapping in stimulated scatter is the

possibility of a plasma wave resonance.  If a resonance is possible for small amplitude

waves, which may easily be discerned from the real part of the linear dielectric function,

then as the wave amplitude, φ, is increased there is a decrease of damping, persistence of

resonance and the stimulated scatter spatial gain rate, κ, increases until φ gets large

enough so that there is a loss of resonance (LOR), and then κ tends to decrease (but see

figure 6 for an example which shows that trapping may increase κ close to LOR44).  The

maximum value that κ attains before decreasing due to LOR is the main subject of this

paper.  It is calculated with a previously derived7 perturbative expression for the

nonlinear dielectric function.

Electron trapping effects are your ally for controlling BSRS in the high temperature

regime, Te = 5keV, at ne = 0.07nc (except for a small increase in κ for small φ as in figure

6) and conversely not your ally at 0.1nc. Linear theory indicates only a factor of 2

difference in BSRS gain rate at these two densities, while trapping can cause as much as

a factor of 6.  Below 0.07nc, the BSRS gain rate decreases slowly with density (see figure

47

9). Proton trapping suppresses BSBS at both densities if Te / Ti < 3 and the hydrogen

fraction is at least 0.5.

Since the first order mode coupling model (MCM), in particular equation (14), always

allows for a resonant plasma response, such a model is unreliable when applied to the

calculation of BSBS in a He-H plasma in the NIF high temperature regime in which an

ion acoustic resonance cannot occur.  Depending on the choice of hohlraum plasma

density, and the corresponding presence or absence of electron plasma wave resonances,

such a model is also inadequate for BSRS.  While in principle, the first order theory may

be generalized to include a 2nd order time derivative, thereby regaining information about

LOR, an alternative mean field approximation model was introduced whose validity does

not require a plasma resonance.  Even if ε is determined by the perturbative expansion of

Ξ, as in (5), (6) and (12), whose validity is not limited to small wavenumbers, and whose

implied frequency shift is non-perturbative, once there is LOR it, as well as any other

first order in time MCM, will fail.

The magnitude of the gain estimates for the NIF examples is not surprising.  Reference

[39] reports maximum amplitude gains of about 10 for both BSRS and BSBS, although

quantitative comparison is not possible since in that work the linear gain is calculated by

integrating over spatially varying intensity, temperature and density profiles relevant to

the basic NIF hohlraum design.  What is new here is the conclusion that at the peak of the

laser pulse, the estimate for BSBS cannot be increased by trapping at 0.1nc (or lower),

48

while that for BSRS may be significantly increased by trapping at 0.1nc, but not at

0.07nc.

Within the framework of stimulated scattering theory presented here, there are several

apparent avenues of research that should yield physically more relevant estimates.  First

the spatial coherence of the laser light is degraded after propagating through several mm

of plasma.  This phenomenon, its effect on the critical intensity and on the mean gain rate

for average intensity below critical for the case of BSRS, need to be quantitatively

modeled.  Second, if plasma parameters are such that daughter plasma waves are

resonant, then a better estimate for the damping due to the escape of trapped electrons (or

protons for the case of BSBS) in a 3D model should be obtained to remove the

uncertainty of the dimensional analysis estimate used in the 1D model.  Third, if the

hohlraum plasma fill is at an electron density, say 0.1nc, at which both electron plasma

waves are resonant at 5keV, then one may need to calculate the nonlinear dielectric

function with a better approximation than would be obtained by merely superposing their

effects.

17 A qualitatively similar model has been studied by H. X. Vu, D. F. DuBois, and B.

Bezzerides , Phys. of Plasmas 9, 1745 (2002).

18 For numerical results, the exact, finite density, light wave dispersion relation is used.

19 For Maxwellian f 0, the Langmuir branch of BGK modes is more responsive than the

electron acoustic branch, so that for the purpose of optimizing the gain rate, it is BSRS

which wins.

20 If the imaginary part is retained, then short wavelength fluctuations are unstable, which

violates the smoothly varying envelope ansatz.

21 When diffraction of the laser light is included, then in regions of space where there is

constructive interference, speckles or intensity hot spots, the laser intensity may attain

values large compared to its average, <I > and upper bound estimates based on a model

with uniform intensity at that average value may be wildly off the mark.  For example,

the absolute instability threshold may be locally exceeded in a collection of hot spots, but

not exceeded in the corresponding uniform case.  More importantly, the distinction

between models with and without diffraction is most dramatic when <I > exceed its

critical value.  See the discussion in section IV.

22 This has been seen in particle simulations, H. X. Vu, D. F. DuBois, and B. Bezzerides,

Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 4306 (2001).

23 The related phenomenon of wave breaking gives a similar estimate, for example, see T.

P. Coffey, Phys. Fluids 14, 1402 (1971) and W. L. Kruer, in The Physics of Laser Plasma

Interactions, 1st edition, edited by D. Pines (Addison-Wesley, New York, 1988), Chap.

24 The MFAM may be extended to include pump depletion by evaluating the mode

coupling term in the equation for E0, which is proportional to  Esrs

25 In a multi-speckle environment, the inter-speckle distribution function, which serves as

the “background” for any given speckle, will differ from that at infinity.

26 It has recently been shown that there are no such traveling wave solutions, Li-Jen

Chen, David Thouless and Jian-Ming Tang, Bull. of the APS 47, No. 9, page 291 (2002),

but if the previous estimate for the loss of trapped electrons is valid, then large enough

amplitude waves will appear as traveling wave solutions for many bounce periods.

27 Since the simulation region is 1200µm long, the MFAM takes about 1100µm to come

up from thermal fluctuations, while the MCM only takes about 1000µm.

28 For perfect consistency of notation, the ordinate of figure 9 should be encased by

parenthesis with the subscript “max”, but in the interest of a lighter notation this is not

done.  The figure caption is unambiguous.

29 In the sense that it yields the maximum gain rate.

30 Recall that if it exceeds 0.53, resonance is not possible.

31 Vu, DuBois and Bezzerides, reference [22], have also noted a significant enhancement

of gain rate above the linear estimate for kλD as large as 0.55.

38 This is a qualitative statement. The laser intensity could be made large enough so that

BSRS acting in isolation could be significant even for kλD >> 0.55.

factor of 2 larger than the amplitude gain rate reported here, on page 2030 of B. J.

40 As is well known, because of the disparity between the ion acoustic and scattered light

speed at low density, the ion acoustic wave has a wavenumber k ≈ 2k 0, and it is more

convenient to characterize its response by its frequency, or phase velocity v, rather than k,

unlike the SRS case.

43 Based on linear dispersion relation analysis, reference [36], it has been found fH=0.5 is

optimal for minimizing the SBS response, although the nonlinear analysis presented here

shows that there may be a significant advantage in choosing fH=0.7.

44 If the calculation shown in figure 6 is repeated for   n ne

c  = 0.08, it is found that the

gain rate increases until eφ / Te = 0.006 at which point it is nearly twice the value at φ = 0

even though    k

λ  for this case is 0.52, on the verge of LOR.

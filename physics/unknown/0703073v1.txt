Abstract  : We  investigated the time domain nonadiabatic dynamics  of  NO2 on the coupled 

X2A1 and A2B2 electronic states by launching wave packets on the excited electronic state and 

focused on the evolution at  long times (

200 fs), which has received little attention up to 

now. We showed that the initial fast spreading of the wave packets is followed at all energies 

by  slow  periodic  intramolecular  vibronic  energy  redistribution  (IVER)  with  periods  in  the 

range  0.3  to  several  tens  of  ps.  These  energy  transfers  lead  to  oscillations  with  the  same 

periods in the population of each electronic state. Propagation of wave packets indicates that 

IVER  frequencies  also  dominate 

the  fluctuations  of 

the  squared  modulus  of 

the 

autocorrelation  function, 

,  at  energies  not  too  high  above  the  bottom  of  the  conical 

intersection, but that this is no longer the case at higher energies. For example, for initial wave 

packets  prepared  by  almost  vertical  excitation  of  the  vibrational  ground  state  of  the  ground 

electronic  surface,  the  oscillations  of 

  essentially  reflect  the  detuning  from  1:2 

resonance between the frequency of the bend and that of the symmetric stretch in the excited 

electronic state. These theoretical results were used to discuss the possible origin of the low 

frequency oscillations which were recently observed in time domain experimental spectra of 

NO2.

t2)(tA2)(tAI - Introduction  

NO2  allies the simplicity of a triatomic molecule  - and the associated amenability to 

sophisticated calculations and high resolution experiments - to a rich and complex behaviour 

that  originates  mainly  from  the  X2A1-A2B2  conical  intersection  between  the  two  lowest 

electronic states of the molecule. It has consequently served as a benchmark for experimental 

and theoretical studies dealing with vibronic coupling and non-Born-Oppenheimer dynamics, 

both in the frequency (see for example Refs. [1-12]) and time (see for example Refs. [13-20]) 

domains. While most essential questions pertaining to the frequency domain seem to be now 

well understood, several fundamental points dealing with time domain properties still deserve 

detailed investigation. For example, little is known concerning the properties of the long time 

evolution,  although  the  short  time  (

  fs  range)  behaviour  has  been  investigated  by 

several  authors  and  is  now  well  characterized  [17-20].  The  need  for  additional  work  in  this 

direction  was  clearly  pointed  out  by  Mahapatra  et  al  in  their  study  of  nonadiabatic  wave 

packet dynamics on realistic ab initio potential energy surfaces [17]. They indeed noticed that 

the initial fast decay of the A2B2 diabatic population is followed by "wiggles" that "are not a 

numerical  artefact"  since  they  are  "reproduced  by  varying  the  grid  size".  After  mentioning 

that "similar effect has also been found previously in other weakly coupled systems" [15], the 

authors  conclude  that  "a  precise  explanation  for  the  time  scale  of  the  oscillations  cannot  be 

given at present". Quite interestingly, experimentalists who use two colours pump-probe laser 

set-ups with photoion and/or photoelectron detection to investigate the time-domain dynamics 

of NO2 close to its first dissociation limit [13,14] come up against the same kind of question : 

their  most  intriguing  result  is  indeed  the  observation  of  a  slow  NO+  transient  signal  with  a 

particularly  pronounced  oscillatory  component  of  period  600-800  fs,  that  is,  an  equivalent 

energy  spacing  of  about  40-55  cm-1.  A  first  study  concluded  that  these  oscillations  "may 

 

 

 

2 

200tmeasure the average energy level spacing between the resonant levels of the A2B2/X2A1 states 

close  to  their  conical  intersection,  but  alternative  explanations  cannot  be  ruled  out"  [13].  In 

contrast, a second study tentatively assigned them to "wave packet motion along a very soft 

coordinate  with  an  underlying  harmonic  level  spacing  of  40  cm-1"  and  suggested  that  this 

motion might be an "essentially free rotation of an oxygen atom around a core NO molecule 

at large O-NO distances" [14]. 

 

It  is  clear from  what  precedes that  the dynamics  of  NO2  at  long times  is  still poorly 

understood. It is precisely the purpose of this paper to fill part of this blank on the basis of the 

detailed  analysis  of  the  dynamics  of  wave  packets  propagated  on  the  coupled  surfaces.  In 

particular,  it  will  be  shown  how  the  wiggles  reported  in  theoretical  calculations  of  the  time 

evolution  of  the  population  of  the  excited  electronic  state  and  the  experimentally  observed 

periodic  oscillations  of  the  NO+  signal  may  or  may  not  be  connected  to  the  nonadiabatic 

coupling between the two surfaces. 

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section II contains a description 

of  the  model  Hamiltonian  we  used  in  this  work.  The  time  evolution  of  the  excited  state 

population  and  of  the  autocorrelation  function  are  analyzed  in  Section  III  for  wave  packets 

launched at several energies on the excited electronic state. Finally, we discuss in Sect. IV the 

connection between the present calculations and experimental results [13,14]. 

II - The effective model 

The model used in this work is derived from that of Ref. [12], whose parameters were 

adjusted  against  the  experimentally  determined  energies  of  the  first  307  vibronic  states.  In 

order to investigate the dynamics at much higher energies without having to worry about the

behaviour  of  high-order  polynomials  at  large  displacements,  most  of  the  anharmonicities  of 

the model were however neglected. More explicitly, the model used here is of the form

III - Wave packet dynamics 

We launched minimum uncertainty wave packets from several positions on the excited 

electronic state. At time

state,

, is of

then the wave packet at time t may be written in the form

For practical purposes, the population in the excited electronic state,  

 , 

 

 

 

 

 

 

           (III-4) 

is best rewritten in the form 

 .  

           (III-5) 

 

Fig. 1 displays the time evolution of 

 for two wave packets which at time 

 are 

of  minimum  uncertainty  and  centred  around 

  and 

 

(dashed line) or 

 (solid line) on the upper A2B2 electronic state (use Eqs. (II-5) and 

(II-6) to get the initial conditions in terms of the normal coordinates of the excited electronic 

states, i.e. the 

 and 

 that appear in Eq. (III-1)). Potential energy at the centre of the wave 

packets at time 

 is approximately 13800 cm-1 for 

 and 20800 cm-1 for 

. 

This means that the centre of the wave packet launched at 

 is located only 3600 cm-1 

above the minimum of the excited electronic state while that of the wave packet launched at 

  is  located  10600  cm-1  above  this  minimum.  The  time  evolution  of 

  is  seen  to 

consist of two phases. The first phase, which lasts about 200 fs at these energies, corresponds 

to the initial spreading of the wave packet, which progressively occupies the whole accessible 

phase  space  in  both  electronic  states.  As  described  in  detail  in  Ref.  [20],  this  phase  is 

associated with a strong and fast decrease of 

, which occurs as a series of steps. Once this 

phase  is  over,  the  population  in  each  electronic  state  fluctuates  around  an  average  value,  in

energy surfaces [17]. Note that classical models reproduce perfectly well the initial decrease 

of 

 but display no fluctuations during the second phase of the time evolution [20]. 

 

As noticed by Mahapatra  et  al  [17],  population  fluctuations  during the second phase 

look like noise, but they are not noise. This is not surprising, since Eq. (III-5) indicates that 

the  oscillatory  part  of 

  is  the  sum  of  periodic  contributions  whose  angular  frequencies 

  are  differences  between  the  energies  of  pairs  of  eigenstates,  while  amplitudes  are 

equal to 

. The squared modulus of the Fourier transform of 

 for 

the wave packets launched at 

 and 

 is shown in the top plots of Figs. 2 and 3, 

respectively.  The  spectrum  of  the  wave  packet  with  lowest  energy  essentially  consists  of  a 

series of six strong lines in the 0-120 cm-1 frequency range. These lines are labelled A to F in 

the top plot of Fig. 2. The lines in the spectrum of the wave packet launched at 

 are 

significantly weaker and appear at comparatively lower frequencies. They are labelled W to Z 

in the top plot of Fig. 3. The pair of eigenstates at the origin of each of these lines is indicated 

in the last column of Table I, while the largest terms of their decomposition on the harmonic 

bases  of  the  ground  and  excited  electronic  states  are  provided  in  Table  II.  Note  that  in  this 

latter table 

 stands for the vector 

 of the harmonic oscillator basis of the 

ground  electronic  state  and 

  for  the  vector 

  of  the  harmonic  oscillator 

basis of the excited electronic state. When the two electronic states are decoupled, i.e. when 

,  all 

  with 

  are  zero  and 

  is  of  course  constant.  Moreover,  states 

which do not contribute to the initial wave packet have projections 

, so that they cannot 

give  rise  to  any  line.  Therefore,  pairs  of  states  which  significantly  contribute  to  the 

fluctuations  of 

  necessarily  (i)  result  from  the  vibronic  coupling  between  at  least  two

. Tables I and 

II  accordingly  show  that  lines  A  to  F  borrow  their  intensity  from  the  vibronic  coupling 

between  [0,5,0]  and  (2,12,1),  [0,6,0]  and  (2,13,1),  [0,4,0]  and  (2,11,1),  [0,2,0]  and  (2,9,1), 

[0,2,0] and (1,11,1), and [0,4,0] and (1,13,1), respectively, while lines W to Z result from the 

vibronic  coupling  between  [1,16,0]  and  (12,6,1),  [0,10,0]  and  (5,7,3),  [0,16,0]  and  (1,24,1), 

and  [0,17,0]  and  (2,23,1),  respectively.  This  is  easily  understood  from  the  considerations 

above  and  from  the  fact  that  excitation  at  time 

  is  almost  exclusively  localized  in  the 

bend degree of freedom, with 

 centred around 4 for the wave packet with lowest energy and 

around 14 for the wave packet with highest energy. To summarize, fluctuations of 

 are 

thus a sensitive fingerprint of the vibronic coupling and reflect the IVER rates of the model. 

 

Let us now consider the time evolution of the squared modulus of the autocorrelation 

function 

which can be written in the form 

 ,

           (III-7) 

Fig. 4 displays the time evolution of 

 for the same wave packets that were used to plot 

Figs. 1-3.  After the  initial  fast  decrease, the  evolution  of 

 consists of fast oscillations 

superposed  on  top  of  slower  ones.  The  slow  oscillations  become  clearer  when  the  signal  is 

averaged with a gaussian window of 90 fs width (FWHM), as can be checked in Fig. 4 where 

the averaged signals appear as white traces. The squared modulus of the Fourier transform of 

 in the range 0-2000 cm-1 is shown in Fig. 5 for the two wave packets, while the bottom 

plots  of  Figs.  2  and  3  display  zooms  of  the  Fourier  transforms  in  the  range  0-125  cm-1. 

According  to  Eq.  (III-7),  periodic  oscillations  of 

  have  angular  frequencies  that  are

. The amplitudes of the 

oscillations are however  very different from those of 

, in the sense that it is sufficient 

that eigenstates j and k be significantly excited at time 

 for the oscillations at 

 

to  contribute  significantly  to  the  evolution  of 

.  In  contrast  with  Eq.  (III-5),  the  scalar 

product 

 does not appear in the expression of 

, so that it is not necessary that 

states  j  and  k  be  resonantly  coupled.  For  example,  the  frequency  of  the  strongest  line  that 

appears  in  the  Fourier  transform  of 

  in  the  range  0-2000  cm-1  for  the  wave  packet 

launched at 

 (line h at 754.28 cm-1 in the top plot of Fig. 5) corresponds to the energy 

difference between eigenstates #272 and #326 (see Table I), which can be described as [0,3,0] 

and  [0,4,0],  respectively,  and  are  NOT  resonantly  coupled  (see  Table  II).  Similarly,  the 

frequency  of  the  very  strong  line  at  1478.33  cm-1  (labelled  k)  corresponds  to  the  energy 

difference  between  eigenstates  #326  and  #386  (see  Table  I),  where  state  #386  can  be 

described  as  [0,5,0].  Examination  of  Table  II  again  indicates  that  these  two  states  are  NOT 

resonantly coupled. Thus, the two bands that appear in the Fourier transforms of 

 in the 

range  0-2000  cm-1  have  frequencies  that  are  approximately 

  and 

.  In  addition  to  the 

harmonics  of 

,  the  Fourier  transform  of 

  also  displays  several  lines  close  to  the 

origin, as can be seen in the bottom plots of Figs. 2 and 3. For the wave  packet with lowest 

energy, launched at 

, these lines (labelled A to F in Fig. 2) turn out to be essentially 

those already observed in the spectrum of 

, although with different intensities. Therefore, 

at this energy the low frequency oscillations of 

 primarily reflect the IVER dynamics of 

the model. Comparison of the two plots in Fig. 3 shows that this is no longer the case for the 

wave  packet  with  highest  energy  launched  at 

.  The  lines  associated  with  the

 (labelled W to Z) are indeed quite weak in the Fourier transform of 

 : 

in particular, they are weaker than another series of lines labelled p to u in the bottom plot of 

Fig. 3, none of these later lines having significant intensity in the power spectrum of 

. 

At this higher energy, the low frequency oscillations of 

 consequently do NOT reflect 

the IVER dynamics of the model. As indicated in Tables I and II, lines p to u are instead due 

to  pairs  of  eigenstates  which,  to  first  approximation,  can  be  described  as 

  and 

, where 

 decreases from 17 (line p) to 12 (line u). Conclusion therefore is that at 

this energy the low frequency oscillations of 

 essentially reflect the detuning from 1:2 

resonance between the frequency of the bend (

) and that of the symmetric stretch 

), the resonance being exact slightly above 

 for this model. 

IV - Relation to time resolved experiments 

As already mentioned in the Introduction,  the most intriguing result of time resolved 

spectroscopic  experiments  on  NO2  close  to  its  first  dissociation  limit  is  indubitably  the 

observation  of  a  slow  NO+  transient  signal  with  a  particularly  pronounced  oscillatory 

component  of  period  600-800  fs,  that  is,  an  equivalent  energy  spacing  of  about  40-55  cm-1 

[13,14]. The origin of these oscillations is still a debated question, since it was suggested in 

Ref. [13] that these oscillations "may measure the average energy level spacing between the 

resonant levels of the A2B2/X2A1 states close to their conical intersection", while the authors 

of  Ref.  [14]  tentatively  assigned  them  to  "wave  packet  motion  along  a  very  soft  coordinate 

with an underlying harmonic level spacing of 40 cm-1", that is, "an essentially free rotation 

of an oxygen atom around a core NO molecule at large O-NO distances". The remainder of 

(

 

 

 

 

10 

eP2)(tA)(tPe2)(tA]0,,0[2v]0,2,1[2v2v2)(tA22222vx1182vthis  paper  is  aimed  at  shedding  some  light  on  this  question  on  the  basis  of  the  calculations 

presented above. More precisely, it is aimed at discussing the earlier proposition of Ref. [13]. 

Our  model  is  indeed  based  on  harmonic  oscillators  and  consequently  does  not  display  the 

correct behaviour at large O-NO distances. Calculations based thereon are therefore not able 

to  confirm  nor  to  infirm  the  later  hypothesis  [14].  Still,  we  would  like  to  mention  that  the 

authors of Ref. [14] invoke the rotation of an oxygen atom around the NO core at large O-NO 

distances because they consider that "this level spacing, 40 cm-1, should be compared to the 

level spacing of the three normal vibrational modes of ground state NO2 (1318, 750 and 1618 

cm-1  for  the  symmetric  stretch,  bend  and  asymmetric  stretch,  respectively)"  [14].  However, 

the harmonic frequencies of NO2 are no longer relevant at large O-NO distances. There, the 

meaningful quantities are instead the frequencies of the core NO stretch, the O-NO bend and 

the  O-NO  stretch.  Since  the  frequency  of  the  O-NO  stretch  precisely  goes  to  zero  at  the 

dissociation  threshold,  this  mode  may  be  at  the  origin  of  the  low  frequency  oscillations 

observed in  experimental  spectra. This  hypothesis  sounds  more realistic  than the rotation of 

the  O  atom  around  the  NO  core.  Anyway,  both  tentative  interpretations  imply  that  a  large 

portion of the initial excitation transfers very rapidly (i.e. within a few hundreds of fs) from 

the bend to the O-NO stretch degree of freedom, a scenario that still has to be ascertained (see 

below). 

 

Except for the behaviour at large O-NO distances, the Hamiltonian of Eqs. (II-1)-(II-5) 

is  expected  to  provide  a  good  description  of  the  two  lowest  electronic  states  of  the  NO2 

molecule. Moreover, the wave packet launched at 

 is a correct approximation of the 

experimentally prepared wave packets, which  consist of the almost vertical excitation of the 

vibrational ground state centred on 

. Finally, the question of the nature of the 

experimental signal is admittedly a complex one, but it has been shown that in simple cases 

the  observable  ionization  signal  in  pump-probe  type  experiments  is  directly  related  to  the 

 

11 

5.02q0321qqqautocorrelation function 

  of the initial  wave packet  [23-25]. As a first  approximation, 

we consider that this is also the case here. The fluctuations of 

 that were theoretically 

investigated in Sect. III therefore provide a good basis to discuss the hypothesis of the authors 

of Ref. [13], who suggested that the observed 40-55 cm-1 angular frequency "may measure the 

average  energy  level  spacing  between  the  resonant  levels  of  the  A2B2/X2A1  states  close  to 

their conical intersection" [13]. 

 

A first  comment is that  wave packet calculations show that  the angular frequency of 

the oscillations in 

 does not reflect the average energy level spacing of resonant levels 

but rather the energy gap between a given pair of eigenstates. It was also shown in Sect. III 

that the strongest lines in the Fourier transform of 

 form bands around the harmonics of 

the 

 fundamental  frequency. This  is  the reason  why  experimentalists who investigate the 

time  dynamics  of  diatomic  molecules  [26-28]  as  well  as  polyatomic  ones  [29-32]  generally 

consider that the oscillations observed in the ionic or electronic signals reflect the frequency 

of a particular mode of the molecule. Here, things are however different because the period of 

the bending motion ( 40 fs) is smaller than the temporal width of the laser ( 90 fs [13,14]). 

All oscillations with frequency higher than 350 cm-1, including all harmonics of 

, are thus 

strongly damped when the computed autocorrelation signal is smoothed over the laser width, 

as is the case for the experimental signal. This is clearly seen in Fig. 4, where the white traces 

show the time evolution of 

 smoothed with a gaussian window of width 90 fs (FWHM) 

and in Fig. 6, which displays a zoom of the smoothed signals in a narrower time window (0-

2.5 ps). The principal components of the smoothed time evolution of 

 are thus the low 

frequency contributions that were discussed in detail in Sect. III. In particular, it was shown 

that, just above the conical intersection, the low frequency fluctuations of 

 essentially 

 

12 

2)(tA2)(tA2)(tA2)(tA222)(tA2)(tA2)(tAreflect the energy gap between pairs of states coupled by the non-adiabatic coupling, but that 

this is no longer the case at higher energies :  for the wave packet launched at

leading contributions to low frequency fluctuations in

of Fig. 3) indeed reflect the detuning from 1:2 resonance between the frequency of the bend 

(

) and that of the symmetric stretch (

). Of course, this result depends critically 

on the parameter 

 we introduced in the model (see Eq. (II-3)). For example, if one assumes 

that 

  instead  of 

  cm-1,  then  the  detuning  from  1:2  resonance  is  equal  to 

  cm-1.  Examination  of  Fig.  6  shows  that,  for 

,  the  smoothed 

autocorrelation  function  accordingly  exhibits  (comparatively)  high-frequency  noise,  while 

lines W to  Z have insufficient  intensity to  generate noticeable  low-frequency  oscillations in 

the  signal.  At  this  point,  it  should  be  emphasized  that  recent  experiments  [33]  confirm  that 

  is  of  the  order  of  a  few  cm-1  and  that  it  is  consequently  very  plausible  that  the  1:2 

resonance between the bend and the O-NO stretch becomes exact in the neighborhood of the 

dissociation  threshold.  Conclusion  therefore  is,  that  it  is  not  very  likely  that  the 

experimentally  observed  low-frequency  oscillations  in  time  domain  spectra  of  NO2  "may 

measure  the  average  energy  level  spacing  between  the  resonant  levels  of  the  A2B2/X2A1 

states",  nor  even  the  energy  gap  between  a  given  pair  of  resonantly  coupled  levels  :  the 

angular  frequencies  of  the  oscillations  are  more  probably  the  energy  gaps  between  states 

 and 

 that are strongly excited at time 

.

The  wave  packet  calculations  presented  in  this  work  confirm  that  there  indeed  exist 

two tentative explanations for the low-frequency oscillations observed in time domain spectra 

of NO2 : 

(i)  they  may  reflect  the  existence  of  a  low  frequency  mode,  like  the  rotation  of  an  oxygen 

atom at large distances from the NO core or, more probably, the O-NO stretch. 

(ii)  they  may  result  from  the  fact  that  the  symmetric  stretch  and  the  bend  approach  1:2 

resonance at the energy of the dissociation threshold. 

 

Additional  work  is  thus  needed  to  determine  which  of  these  two  phenomena  is 

responsible for the signal with 600-800 fs period that is observed in time resolved spectra of 

NO2 [13,14]. For example, the following points could be investigated : 

-  hypothesis  (i)  implies  that  a  large  portion  of  the  excitation  of  the  initial  wave  packet 

transfers  rapidly  (within  a  few  hundreds  of  fs)  from  the  bend  to  the  O-NO  stretch,  while 

hypothesis (ii) requires in contrast that the energy remains essentially localized in the bend for 

at least several ps. It would therefore be of primary interest to check this point on surfaces that 

have the correct behaviour at large O-NO distances. Classical calculations presented in Ref. 

[19] suggest that energy indeed transfers very rapidly to the O-NO stretch degree of freedom, 

but  the  nonadiabatic  coupling  of  the  investigated  model  was  5  to  10  times  too  large  and 

quantum  mechanical  calculations  performed  on  the  same  model  failed  to  reproduce  this 

behaviour [19]. This is therefore a question which deserves further attention. 

- one could try to find out whether the rotational motion invoked by the authors of Ref. [14] is 

plausible  or  not  by  looking  at  the  periodic  orbits  on  the  lower  electronic  surface  :  the 

"rotational"  motion  of  the  wave  packet  is  indeed  possible  only  if  there  exists  a  not  too 

unstable classical periodic orbit with the same characteristics. 

- the evolution with increasing energy of the period of the oscillations could be investigated 

experimentally.  Indeed,  slow  modes  exist  only  close  to  the  threshold  and  their  period  is  an 

 

14 

increasing function of energy. In contrast, detuning from the 1:2 resonance may lead to non-

monotonous  or  even  decreasing  periods  if  the  exact  resonance  is  located  below  the 

dissociation threshold. 

- last but not least, both the ionization process and the nature of the experimental signal  are 

still debated questions [14]. No definitive conclusion regarding the origin of the slow periodic 

signal in time domain spectra of NO2 will be met as long as these two points are not better 

understood. In particular, it was suggested in Ref. [14] that the slow NO+ ions at the origin of 

the oscillations with 600-800 fs period may result from the absorption of two 266 nm photons 

by an almost dissociated molecule in its ground electronic state. If this were confirmed, then 

our assumption that the experimental signal is proportional to 

 would be invalidated, so 

that much more complex calculations would be needed to compare theoretical predictions and 

experimental results.

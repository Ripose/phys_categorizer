Abstract
In this paper we present  a new kind of boundary layer flow produced  by 
an  electromagnetic  Lorentz  force  which  acts  parallel  to  the  plate  in  an 
electrically conductive fluid.  The plate is motionless and the ambient fluid 
stagnant.  This  flow  is  equivalent  to  the  classical    free  convective  flow 
along  a  vertical  plate.  The  boundary  layer  equations  are  transformed  to 
non-dimensional  form  and  a  new  dimensionless  number  is  introduced 
which  is  equivalent  to  the  Grashof  number.  The  transformed  boundary 
layer  equations  are  solved  with  the  finite  difference  method  and  the 
presented  results  include  values  of  the  friction  coefficient  and  velocity 
profiles.

INTRODUCTION
    Magnetohydrodynamis is the study of the interaction between magnetic 
fields  and  moving,  conducting  fluids.  (Davidson,  2006).    In  this  case  a 
force  is  produced  inside  the  fluid  which  is  proportional  to  fluid  velocity 
and  this  force  always  opposes  the  flow.  Another  way  to  produce  a  force 
inside  a  flowing  fluid,  not  known  widely,  is  the  application  of  an 
externally applied magnetic as well as an externally applied electric field. 
(see figure 1). This force is called Lorentz force  and can be generated by a 
stripwise arrangement of flush mounted electrodes and permanent magnets
of  alternating  polarity  and  magnetization. The  Lorentz  force  which  acts 
parallel  to  the  plate  can  either  assist  or  oppose    the  flow.    The  idea  of 
using a Lorentz force to  stabilize a boundary layer flow over a flat plate 
belongs probably  to Gailitis and Lielausis (1961).  The idea of using the 
Lorentz  force  for  flow  control  by  Gailitis  and  Lielausis  was  later 
abandoned  and  only  recently  attracted  new  attention  (Henoch  and  Stace, 
1995,  Crawford  and  Karniadakis,  1997,  Berger  et  al.  2000,  Spong  et  al. 
2005).  In addition, in  last years much investigation on flow control using 
the Lorentz force is being conducted at the Rossendorf Institute and at  the 
Institute for Aerospace Engineering  in Dresden, Germany (Posdziech and 
Grundmann, 2001, Weier and Gerbeth, 2004, Weier, 2005, Mutschke et al. 
2006, Albrecht and Grundmann, 2006).
    Although much investigation has been done in different  fields  simple 
problems, including a Lorentz force, have not been investigated until now. 
The  purpose  of  the  present  paper  is  to  analyze  the  boundary  layer  flow 
produced  by  a    Lorentz  force  acting  parallel  to  the  plate  while  the  plate 
and  the  ambient  fluid  are  at  rest.  This  problem  is  “equivalent”  to  the 
classical free convection along a vertical plate due to buoyancy forces. In 
our case, the role of buoyancy forces play the Lorentz forces while there is 
no  need  for  the  plate  to  be  vertical,  because  the  Lorentz  forces  are 
independent of gravity. It is a problem of  “free convection” independent 
of gravity.        
     

THE MATHEMATICAL MODEL 

Consider   the flow along a   plate with u and v denoting respectively the 
velocity  components  in  the  x  and  y  direction,  where  x  is  the  coordinate 

along  the  plate  and  y  is  the  coordinate  perpendicular  to  x.  It  is  assumed 
that  in  the  flow  over  the  plate  a  Lorentz  force  exists.    For  steady,  two-
dimensional  flow  the  boundary  layer  equations  with  constant  fluid 
properties are (Tsinober and Shtern, 1967, Weier, 2005)

where ν is the fluid  kinematic  viscosity,   j0 (A/m2)  is the applied current 
density in the electrodes, M0 (Tesla) is the magnetization of the permanent 
magnets,  α is  the  width  of  magnets  and  electrodes  and  ρ  is  the  fluid 
density.  The  last  term  in  the  momentum  equation  is  due  to  the  Lorentz 
force, decreases exponentially with  y and is independent of the flow. 
The  boundary conditions  are:

at y = 0:    u = 0,  v =0                                                                                (3)
as y →   u =0                                                                                                                                          (4)

From the above equations it is clear that the only governing parameter of 
this problem is the quantity Pa. 
    In the classical  problem of  free convection  along a vertical  motionless 
isothermal  plate,  with  temperature  Tw,  situated  in  a  calm  fluid  with 
temperature  T∞,  the  governing  parameter  is  the  well  known  Grashof 
number defined as  (Jaluria, 1980,  Bejan, 1995,  White, 2006)

where  β  is  the  volumetric  expansion  coefficient  of  the  fluid  and  l  is  the 
characteristic  length  of  the  flow.  The  Grashof  number  expresses  the 
balance between the  buoyant forces to viscous forces and was introduced 
in  fluid  mechanics   by  the German engineer  Franz  Grashof  (1826-1893). 
Although  the  Grashof  number  is  widely  used  in  heat  transfer  and  fluid 
mechanics, the man for whom the grouping  was named is not familiar to 
workers  in  the  field.  Historical  and  bibliographical  information  on  this 
matter is given by Sanders and Holman (1972).
    Comparing  equations  (5)  and  (12)  we  see  that  the  new  dimensionless 
number  Pa is  equivalent to the Grashof number with characteristic flow 
length the width of magnets or the width of electrodes (see figure 1). The 
quantity  Pa,  which  expresses  the  balance  between  the  electromagnetic 
body forces to viscous forces, is introduced here for the first time and may 
be called the Pantokratoras number. 
   After  the  introduction  of    Pa and  the  transformation    we  solved  the 
above equations (10)-(11)  using the finite difference  method of Patankar 
(1980).   The solution procedure starts at the plate leading edge  (x*=0) and 
marches  along  the  plate.    At  each  downstream  position  the  discretized 
equation  (11)  is  solved  using  the  tridiagonal  matrix  algorithm  (TDMA).  
The cross-stream velocities v were obtained from the continuity equation. 
The forward step size Δx* was 0.001 and the  lateral grid cells  were 500.
The   results  are    grid  independent.  The  parabolic  (marching)    solution 
procedure is a well known solution method,   has been used extensively  in 
the  literature    and    has  been  included  in  widely  used  textbooks  (Jaluria 
and  Torrance,  1986,  page  173  and    White  2006,  page  276).  A  detailed 

description  of  the  solution  procedure    may  be  found  in  Pantokratoras 
(2002).

The  results  of  table  1  are  shown  in  figure  2.  We  see  that  the  friction 
coefficient increases with increasing Pa and x*.  This is in accordance with 
the velocity profiles, shown in figures 3 and 4,  where we see that velocity 
increases with increasing Pa and x*.  However, in figure  4, although the 
velocity increases with increasing  Pa, the velocity width  decreases at the 
same x*.

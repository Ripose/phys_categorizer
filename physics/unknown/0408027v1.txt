Universe structure emerges in the unreduced, complex-dynamic interaction process with the simplest initial 
configuration  (two  attracting  homogeneous  fields).  The  unreduced  interaction  analysis  gives  intrinsically 
creative cosmology, describing the real, explicitly emerging world structure with dynamic randomness on 
each scale. Without imposing any postulates or entities, we obtain physically real space, time, elementary 
particles  with  their  detailed  structure  and  intrinsic  properties,  causally  complete  and  unified  version  of 
quantum  and  relativistic  behaviour,  the  origin  and  number  of  naturally  unified  fundamental  forces,  and 
classical behaviour emergence in closed systems. Main problems of standard cosmology and astrophysics 
are consistently solved in this extended picture (without introduction of any additional entities), including 
those  of  quantum  cosmology  and  gravity,  entropy  growth  and  time,  “hierarchy”  of  elementary  particles, 
“anthropic”  difficulties,  space-time  flatness,  and  “missing”  (“dark”)  mass  and  energy.  The  observed 
universe structure and laws can be presented as manifestations of the universal symmetry (conservation) of 
complexity providing the unified, irregular, but exact (never “broken”) Order of the World.

1. Standard vs complex-dynamic cosmology 

Contrary  to  experimental,  observational  successes  in  modern  astro-physics,  the  explanatory  power  of  the 
corresponding cosmological theories remains limited, so that the number of unsolved problems only grows, 
while those considered to be “solved” often resemble rather a “plausibly” looking adjustment of artificially 
introduced entities and  free parameters (see e.g. ref. [1]  for a critical review).  Without going  into detailed 
discussion of those difficulties, we only note here that one can see a possible general origin of such situation, 
which is  inherent in the conventional theory, but have specific, more distinct manifestations in cosmology. 
As it has first been emphasized by Bergson [2] and confirmed by further science development (see e.g. [3]), 
conventional  science  methods  do  not  describe  the  explicit  structure  emergence  as  such,  but  are  limited 
instead  to  postulation  of  already  existing  structure  configuration,  properties,  and  formal,  imitative 
“evolution” (in the form of “laws”, “principles”, “models”, “equations”, etc.). Whereas such approach can be 
relatively  useful  in the study of simple, easily  measurable and  “smoothly”  evolving objects (the canonical 
case of “Newtonian mechanics”), it will be much less efficient in explanation of the origin and dynamics of 
entities, such as the universe, that cannot be simply “postulated” with all their observed properties because 
they undergo strong, qualitative changes of configuration (explicit emergence of structure) involving many 
diverse, hierarchically organised, and entangled elements. 

In other words, the true cosmology  should describe the unreduced, explicit  formation of a  complicated 
structure, which just remains obscure in the conventional theory framework. A related difficulty of the latter 
is that it cannot consistently solve any realistic, many-body interaction problem, always resorting to one or 
another  simplified  “model”  or  “perturbative”  approximation,  whereas  it  is  clear  that  such  unreduced 
interaction process underlies any real structure formation. In particular, the standard theory cannot provide 
the  unambiguous,  universal  origin  of  the  major  property  of  mass  (and  energy),  operating  instead  with  its

measurable  inertial  and  gravitational  manifestations.  Although  this  problem  could  remain  among  “less 
important”  ones  in  “Newtonian”  science  fields,  the  difficulties  with  “dark”  mass  and  energy  “suddenly” 
emerge now on the global scale as quite important, if not fatal, defects of the whole world picture. 

In this report we describe a new, extended cosmology framework, based on the unreduced, truly “exact” 
solution  of  arbitrary  interaction  problem  that  gives  explicit  emergence  of  real  structures  without  any 
artificial simplification and leads to the rigorously derived, truly universal concept of dynamic complexity [4-
17]. This unreduced dynamic complexity  is quite different  from the existing  imitations of  “complexity”  in 
the conventional theory and unifies the qualitatively extended versions of dynamical chaos, self-organisation, 
self-organised criticality, fractality, adaptability, etc. 

We start with showing how the fundamental entities and properties of the universe, including physically 
specified space and time, elementary particles, their properties, interactions and dynamics, explicitly emerge 
in  the  provably  simplest  initial  configuration  of  interaction  process,  comprising  two  structureless, 
omnipresent, physically real fields, homogeneously attracted to each other (section 2). It is important that we 
obtain  together  the  main  entities  (space,  time,  particles),  their  properties  (mass-energy,  charge,  spin, 
interactions), and dynamical laws (quantum and relativistic behaviour) within the same, intrinsically unified 
concept of complexity, using a rigorous derivation procedure and no additional, postulated laws or entities 
besides  the  evidently  “minimal”  starting  interaction  configuration  (section  3).  We  show  then  how  the 
naturally emerging, truly dynamic properties of complexity and chaoticity in a system with interaction give 
rise to all  higher-level  structures and  solve the difficulties of the conventional theory which  neglects those 
properties  because  of  its  artificial  reduction  and  therefore  loses  inevitably  the  essence  of  such  major 
properties as mass and energy (sections 4, 5). 

We  emphasize  the  intrinsically  unified  and  reality-based  character  of  the  proposed  solution  of  all  the 
main,  quite  diverse  problems  of  the  conventional  theory,  consistently  derived  simply  by  the  unreduced, 
universally  nonperturbative  solution  of  an  arbitrary  (generic)  interaction  problem,  which  confirms  the 
power of unreduced scientific  logic and reveals the genuine, exact origin of the standard theory limitations 
and  difficulties  as  being  due  to  the  dynamically  single-valued,  zero-complexity  approximation  of  the 
canonical approach that neglects all emerging system realisations but a single, “averaged” one. The ultimate, 
mathematically  exact  expression  of  the  obtained  unification  is  provided  by  the  universal  symmetry,  or 
conservation, of complexity that determines the emergence of all structures of the universe and laws of their 
behaviour and therefore constitutes the genuine, unique Order of the World (section 2) [4-6]. 

2. Universe structure emergence in the unreduced interaction process 
development 

No structure can emerge without interaction. A universe structure formation should start from the simplest 
possible (least structured) interaction configuration, which is still able to produce explicitly the observed real 
structures. The most structureless configuration of a physically real system with interaction is given by two 
homogeneous  (effectively  structureless),  uniformly  interacting  entities  represented  by  two  physically  real 
fields,  or  protofields,    which  are  attracted  to  each  other  and  whose  composition  (of  sufficiently  small 
elements) does not play any essential, direct role in the following structure formation [4,5,11-17]. Interaction 
between  protofields  supposes  their  different  physical  qualities  designated  as  gravitational  protofield  (or 
medium)  and  electromagnetic  (e/m)  protofield,  since  we  show  later  that  they  are  responsible  for  the 
emerging  (and  universally  present)  gravitational  and  e/m  interactions,  respectively.  The  structureless 
protofields  are  omnipresent  by  definition  and  therefore  cannot  be  related  to  any  postulated  (let  alone 
“hidden”) spatial “dimensions”, time “variables”, mathematical structures and laws, etc., none of which may 
have  a  sense  at  this  initial  stage  (cf.  recent  imitations  of  this  approach  within  so-called  “brane-world” 
scenarios of the unitary theory [18-20]). The extended, complex-dynamical and physically real versions of 
those  entities  and  laws  are  consistently  derived  in  our  theory  starting  from  the  existence  equation  that 
describes the above simplest protofield interaction without any limitation or model assumption [4-6,11-17]:

If, however, we avoid any perturbative reduction of system (3) and try to find its unreduced solution by the 
method of substitution, using the standard Green function technique, then we arrive at problem formulation 
in terms of generalised optical, or effective, potential (EP) [4-17,21,22]. The latter is a well-known method, 
but  is  used  routinely  in  its  reduced,  perturbative  approximation  (see  e.g.  [21]).  Direct  analysis  of  the 
unreduced EP expression shows that the original problem has the redundant number of locally “complete” 
and  thus  mutually  incompatible  (but  equally  real)  solutions  called  system  and  problem  realisations  [4-
17,22].  Therefore  the  truly  complete  general  solution  to  a  problem  is  given,  in  terms  of  system  “density” 
),qρ ξ   (generalising  also  other  measured  quantities),  by  the  causally  probabilistic  sum  over  redundant

dynamic single-valuedness and the whole standard-theory reduction dynamically  single-valued, or unitary,

Another major property of the unreduced solution, closely related to dynamic multivaluedness, is dynamic 
entanglement of the inter-acting system components (protofields in this case), expressed by the dynamically 
weighted  products  of  different  component  eigenfunctions  depending  on  their  respective  “degrees  of 
,qξ )  in  the  unreduced  state-function  expression,  eq.  (8).  Dynamic  entanglement  provides  the 
freedom”  (
physical meaning of interaction as such, as well as the rigorous expression of tangible quality of interaction 
products, absent  in  any  unitary theory describing only  an abstract, external  “envelope” of a real  structure. 
The property of dynamic entanglement is further amplified by that of dynamically probabilistic fractality of 
the unreduced solution, which  extends  essentially the ordinary, dynamically  single-valued  fractality  and  is 
obtained by repeated use of the same, universal EP method in order to solve truncated systems of equations, 
starting  from eqs. (11), whose solutions enter the  expressions  for  previous  level of  structure (see eqs.  (8), 
(10)) [4,8]. One obtains thus the whole hierarchy of not only entangled, but permanently probabilistically, 
interactively changing and thus dynamically adapting realisations of the emerging system structure.

It is not difficult to find the emerging realisation configuration for two attracting, initially homogeneous 
protofields [4,5,10,11,13,17]. The resonant-denominator structure of the state-function and EP expressions, 
eqs.  (8),  (10),  in  combination  with  “cutting”  integrals  in  the  numerators,  shows  that  the  magnitude  of  the 
η  
r
state-function components for each particular (r-th) realisation is concentrated around certain eigenvalue 
i
η   and  interpreted  as  the  centre  of  the 
for  that  realisation,  which  can  be  conveniently  designated  as 
dynamically emerging,  local concentration of the  attracting protofield density, or emerging physical  space 
point and its coordinate. This local dynamical squeeze of the initially totally homogeneous protofield system 
appears to be inevitable physically, for the real, unreduced interaction dynamics: every small density increase 
of a protofield will provoke a self-amplifying chain of further density increase of both protofields around that 
location  because  the  larger  is  the  density  of  one  of  the  protofields,  the  stronger  is  attraction  between  the 
protofields  at  that  place.  That  omnipresent  dynamic  instability  of  the  unreduced  protofield  interaction, 
accompanied  and  assisted  by  the  above  dynamic  entanglement,  is  absent  in  any  unitary  approximation, 
cutting  the  emerging  interaction  links  and  therefore  predicting  only  small  deviations  from  the  initial 
configuration  inhomogeneity.  In  the  unreduced  analysis  it  leads  to  maximum  local  squeeze,  or  dynamic 
reduction,  of  the  attracting  protofields  around  a  location,  or  (emerging)  physical  point,  which  is  chosen 
among  other  neighbouring,  equally  probable  locations  in  a  causally  (dynamically)  random  way,  in  full 
agreement  with  the  above  rigorously  derived  expressions  for  realisation  structure  and  probability,  eqs. 
(8),(10),(12). The maximum squeeze of entangled protofields, determining the fully developed structure of a 
“regular” system realisation, is limited by finite protofield compressibility, and is naturally followed by the 
reverse process of protofield disentanglement and extension to the initial, quasi-homogeneous state, which is 
initiated and governed by the same system instability as the previous phase of reduction. 

One  obtains  thus  the  emerging,  physically  specified  and  totally  real  dynamical  structure  of  (massive) 
elementary particle, such as the electron, in the form of unceasing periodic cycles of dynamic reduction and 
extension of two attracting protofields, where the centre of each next reduction is chosen by the system in a 
dynamically  (truly)  random  fashion.  We  call  this  explicitly  emerging,  internally  entangled,  permanently 
changing, and spatially chaotic particle structure quantum beat process [4,5,11-17]. Its reality is confirmed 
by the properties of the unreduced solution within the generalised EP formalism, eqs. (7)-(12). In particular, 
the latter contains not only the locally squeezed structure of “regular” realisations described above, but also 
one  specific,  extended  realisation  with  a  “loose”,  chaotically  fluctuating  structure  that  describes  the 
disentangled system state during transition between two squeezed, “regular” realisations. It is this transient 
state called intermediate, or “main”, realisation that corresponds to effectively weak interaction value of a 
perturbative  approximation  (eqs.  (5)-(6))  and  constitutes  the  physically  real  particle  wavefunction,  which 
represents the totally causal extension of the unitary quantum wavefunction (artificially mystified because of 
dynamically single-valued “modelling”) and due to the unrestricted universality of our analysis can be further 
extended to any kind of  system  and  level of world dynamics (also  in the  form of generalised distribution 
function)  [4-6,12-17].  This  physically  real,  interaction-driven  duality  between  squeezed  and  extended 
state/phase  of  the  quantum  beat  process  within  the  elementary  particle  evokes  its  another  definition  as 
elementary field-particle [4,5,11-17]. 

The emerging length scale  x∆  of the quantum beat process is rigorously defined by the distance between 
neighbouring regular realisations as given by the eigenvalue separation 
for different r, found from the 
unreduced EP formalism, eqs. (9)-(10), 
.  It is the length of the elementary, real quantum jump of 
the squeezed, “corpuscular” state of the particle, or virtual soliton, between its two regular realisations within

A  big  number  of  different  elementary  field-particles  will  emerge  in  the  described  way  in  the  initially 
homogeneous system of two interacting protofields. This follows from the same basic property of dynamic 
multivaluedness and its hierarchical fractal structure. Local quantum beat processes can have several major 
realisations  with  essentially  different  EP  magnitude,  where  relatively  small  amplitudes  form  (compound) 
realisation of lighter particles (leptons) with weaker relation to the gravitational protofield, while much larger 
amplitudes constitute realisation of hadrons with essential entanglement of e/m and gravitational protofields. 
Each  of  such  “big”  compound  realisations  of  the  first  level  of  interaction  structure  can  contain  various 
particle  subspecies  and  then  end  up  in  splitting  into  numerous  individual  particles,  situated  at  different 
(emerging)  locations  and  represented  by  a  certain  level  of  fractal  hierarchy  of  dynamic  multivaluedness, 
described  above  as  quantum  beat  process  within  each  (massive)  particle.  Higher  levels  of  (weaker) 
interaction between these entities of the first complexity level start then naturally emerge (see below), but the 
factor of  deep  cosmological  importance  at  this  and  higher  levels  of  structure  emergence  is  their  intrinsic, 
dynamic  adaptability  determined  by  the  self-consistent  dependence  of  the  unreduced,  nonperturbative  EP, 
eqs.  (8)-(10),  on  the  emerging  structure  parameters  (exemplified  by  the  eigenvalues  η).  Thus,  any  new 
particle emergence increases the protofield tension, and when the latter is high enough, no more particles can 
form  (for  a  given  interaction  magnitude).  Therefore  the  protofield  interaction  strength  dynamically 
determines the  number (mass density) of particles  in the universe. One obtains thus  a self-tuning universe 
that  avoids,  simply  due  to  its  unrestricted  interaction  problem  solution,  any  “anthropic”  problems  or 
“catastrophically” adjusted values of universal constants [4,5,11-13,17] (see also sections 3.2, 3.3). 

The quantity of dynamic  complexity  as  such of any real  interaction process and  emerging  structure can 
now be universally defined as a growing function of the total number of its realisations (explicitly obtained 
from the unreduced problem solution) or of their rate of change, equal to zero for the unrealistic case of only 
one system realisation (it is this extreme simplification of reality that is exclusively considered in the unitary 
theory, which explains, as we continue to show below, all its “old” and “new” problems).‡ The physically 
real,  dynamically  emerging  space  and  time  defined  above  constitute  two  universal  manifestations  of  the 
unreduced  complexity,  characterising  already  a  single  realisation  structure  (space)  and  change  (time).  We 
shall  proceed  now  to  the  most  important  forms  and  measures  of  dynamic  complexity,  representing  the 
totality of system realisations and thus its causally complete structure and dynamics. 

A

A  universal  measure  of  complexity  is  provided  by  the  simplest  combination  of  independent  space  and 
time  elements,  known  as  action  and  acquiring  now  an  extended,  universal  and  essentially  nonlinear 
  is  the  action-complexity  increment,  while  E  and  p  are 
meaning, 
coefficients  identified  as  energy  and  momentum.  They  represent  universal  differential  measures  of 
complexity related to the integral measure of action:

entropy (see the end of this section).

The  quantum  wave  equations  (of  Klein-Gordon,  Dirac  and  Schrödinger)  can  be  derived  from  eq.  (20)  by 
causal quantisation, expressing multivalued dynamics in terms of intermediate, delocalised realisation of the 
wavefunction [4,5,12,13,16,17] (see also below). 

Elementary  field-particles,  causally  obtained  thus  as  complex-dynamical  quantum  beat  processes,  form 
the  entities  of  the  first  level  of  emerging  real-world  structure,  or  first  level  of  complexity.  Due  to  the 
physically  unified  world  construction  of  two  interacting  proto-fields,  the  entities  of  the  first  level  start 
interacting  among  them  and  form  higher  levels  of  complex-dynamical  world  structure  by  the  same, 
universally  described  development  of  unreduced  interaction  process.  It  is  easy  to  see  that  the  number, 
physical  origin,  and  properties  of  the  four  “fundamental  forces”  between  particles  obtain  a  transparent 
explanation  within  this  theory  [5,12-17],  designated  as  quantum  field  mechanics.  Long-range  interaction 
through  the  e/m  and  gravitational  protofield  gives  the  omnipresent  e/m  and  gravitational  interactions, 
respectively, whereas short-range (“contact”) interaction between the protofield elements (poorly resolved as 
such) appears as “weak” and “strong” interaction forces, where one can clearly see the origin of the (known) 
unification of e/m and weak interactions (transmitted by the e/m protofield) and similar (but unrecognised) 
unity  between  the  gravitational  and  strong  interaction.  Moreover,  all  the  four  interactions  are  naturally, 
dynamically unified within each elementary (hadronic) particle-process, especially in the maximum squeeze 
state of its unceasing quantum beat pulsation. The physical origin of the gravitational protofield, or medium, 
can also be causally understood now as a dense, viscous form of “quark matter” (or “condensate”), where the 
famous “confinement” of quarks acquires an equally transparent origin. Photons, on the other hand,  can be 
interpreted  as  relatively  weak,  and  therefore  quasi-regular  and  massless,  excitations  of  the  e/m  protofield, 
stabilised by attraction to the gravitational protofield (and being thus closer to usual, regular solitons). 

One obtains also the dynamic, physical interpretation of electric charge (as quantum beat pulsation with a 
fixed temporal phase), its “quantized” value, and two “opposite” types (as quantum beat synchronisation in 
the  e/m  medium)  [4,12-17],  where  the  quantized  e/m  interaction  by  “exchange  of  photons”  (during  the 
“extended” phase of quantum beat) acquires now a physically real sense. The property of spin and related 
magnetic field effects obtain  a uniquely consistent  explanation  as  highly  nonlinear vortex dynamics of the 
reduction-extension process within every quantum beat cycle. 

Complex-dynamic interaction development between field-particles leads to causally understood processes 
of true quantum chaos (absence of dissipation) [4,5,9], quantum measurement (small dissipation) [4,10], and 
classical  (permanently localised) behaviour emergence  in  an elementary  bound, closed  system (like atom) 
[4,5,12-17], without any ambiguous “decoherence by environment”. Classical behaviour emerges as a next, 
superior level of complexity that gives rise, in its turn, to all higher complexity levels by further development 
of  the  same  unreduced,  intrinsically  unified  interaction  process  between  two  initially  homogeneous 
protofields. The  complete  macroscopic  world  structure and  dynamics  is thus explicitly obtained  from that 
starting  “minimal”  interaction configuration, where such persisting  “cosmological” problems  as origin  and 
emergence  of  space  and  time,  the  “wavefunction  of  the  universe”,  classicality  emergence,  and  quantum 
gravity are naturally resolved, together with other ones from particular fields of fundamental physics, within 
the intrinsically unified description of complex protofield interaction dynamics [4-7,12-17]. 

The unrestricted universality of structure emergence description finds its most complete expression in the 
universal  symmetry  (or  conservation)  of  complexity  [4-6,13,17],  which  provides  the  unified,  causally 
complete  extension  of  all  (correct)  dynamic  equations,  laws  and  principles,  remaining  unexplained 
(postulated), separated, and often contradictory within the dynamically single-valued projection of reality in 
the standard, unitary theory. The causally specified qualitative change and explicit structure emergence in the 
universal science of complexity permit us to introduce two major forms of dynamic complexity. One of them 
is  called  dynamic  information,  I,  and  expresses  the  real  interaction  complexity  before  any  structure 
emergence has actually begun. It generalises the usual notion of “potential energy” and is actually given (in 
its  integral  version)  by  the  generalised  action, 
,  introduced  above.  The  second  universal  form  of 

A

Complex-Dynamic Cosmology and Emergent World Structure                                          9 

complexity  is  called  dynamic  entropy,  S,  and  characterises  the  dynamic  complexity  of  already  appeared 
structures (it generalises the usual notions of “kinetic” and “heat” energy). The symmetry, or conservation, of 
complexity  means that every process occurs so that the sum of dynamic  information and entropy, or total 
,  which  means  that  always  decreasing  dynamic 
dynamic  complexity,  remains  constant, 
information (expressing system “potentiality”) is transformed into the dual, always growing complexity form 
∆ = −∆ < . The “first” and “second” laws of thermodynamics are thus essentially 
of dynamic entropy, 
extended  to  any  kind  of  system  or  process,  unified  in  a  single,  dynamic  symmetry,  and  liberated  from 
unpleasant skewness of the usual second law (which resolves the related cosmology problems, see section 4). 
Contrary to any unitary symmetry, the symmetry of complexity is always exact (never “broken”), but gives 
more or less irregular structures.

various particular dynamic equations, usually corresponding to several first terms of power-series expansion 
of the generalised Hamiltonian [4-6].  

Cosmological meaning of the universal symmetry of complexity goes, however, far beyond its particular 
mathematical expression. It represents the unified, exact Order of the World, applicable to the universe in the 
whole  or  any  its  part,  including  its  causally  specified  origin  and  structure  development  (in  their  realistic, 
unreduced versions). Symmetry of complexity rigorously excludes, in particular, any possibility of universe 
emergence  from  “nothing”  (with  the  zero  total  energy  value),  since  only  positive  (and  big)  values  of  the 
initial  interaction  complexity  (in  the  form  of  dynamic  information)  can  give  rise  to  further  structure 
development (with  equally  positive and big total energy) and real time  flow, eq. (22) (see also section 4). 
This  fundamental  positiveness  of  the  universe  content,  distinguishing  it  from  the  zero-content  unitary 
models,  is  directly  related  to  the  dynamic  multivaluedness  and  intrinsic  randomness  of  any  real  process, 
reduced to the dynamically single-valued projection in the unitary perturbative schemes that avoid any real, 
change-bringing  interaction.  We  shall  see  below  that  the  properties  of  the  unreduced,  dynamically 
multivalued world dynamics often do not even contain, or permit us to consistently solve, the accumulating 
“old”  and  “new”  problems  of  the  unitary  cosmology  and  astrophysics,  including  the  “missing”  mass  and 
energy content of the world. 

3. Global properties of the emerging complex-dynamical universe structure 

We shall outline, in this section, the “global”, cosmological properties of the real, complex-dynamical world 
construction,  such  as  they  follow  from  the  unreduced,  multivalued  dynamics  of  the  underlying  protofield 
interaction process (some of them were already  mentioned  in  section 2). Note that practically  none of  this 
real-world  properties  can  be  consistently  reproduced  by  any  version  of  the  unitary  theory,  irrespective  of 
whether  it  is recognised as a true cosmological problem or not. Artificial  addition of  new abstract entities 
(such  as  “hidden  dimensions”  or  new,  equally  “invisible”  particle  species),  accompanied  by  “facilitated” 
parameter adjustment, certainly cannot change this situation, since new entities create new difficulties, thus 
simply displacing, or renaming, previous problems that remain basically unsolved because of their deceptive 
reduction to over-simplified, effectively zero-dimensional models. 

3.1. Physically real, 3D space and irreversible time flow 

We  have  seen  in  section  2  how  the  unreduced  interaction  between  two  initially  homogeneous  protofields 
gives  rise  to  highly  inhomogeneous  structure  of  physically  real,  tangible  space  and  equally  real,  but 
immaterial, irreversibly flowing time that can not be really “mixed” with space in an (abstract) “manifold”. 

We causally derive the exact number (three) of spatial dimensions, or “degrees of freedom”, as being due 
to  the  dynamic  entanglement  of  two  protofields  and  their  physically  real  interaction  as  such.  This 
conservation  of  the  number  of  basic  entities,  or  “degrees  of  freedom”  during  the  interaction  process  is  a 
consequence of the universal symmetry (conservation) of complexity (see the end of section 2), supported by 
the totality of existing observations. We thus reveal also the detailed physical nature of those emerging space 
“dimensions” (remaining only abstract symbols in the canonical theory): they are obtained as a chaotically 
changing,  interaction driven “mixture” (and inhomogeneous “deformation”) of the physically real, initially 
homogeneous protofield “material”. 

We  reveal  the  role  of  essential  nonlinearity,  omnipresent  dynamic  instability,  and  resulting  causal 
randomness  (chaoticity)  of  quantum  beat  dynamics  of  interacting  protofields  in  establishment  of  spatially 
chaotic sequence of reduction-extension events within each field-particle, which gives rise to unceasing and 
unpredictable in detail (and therefore irreversible) time flow. 

Universality of the obtained concept of space and time is supported by its unrestricted applicability to any 
system or level of complexity, giving rise to the fractally structured hierarchy of space and time that simply 
repeats  the  hierarchy  of  world  (interaction)  complexity  and  demonstrates  the  dynamic  origin  and  close 
connection between space and time elements at each level of world structure. All cosmological problems of 
time  (its  absence  in  the  effectively  empty  world,  magically  “tunneling”  from  nothing,  etc.)  are  thus 
consistently  solved  (see  the  “time  flow”  condition  of  eq.  (22)  and  section  4.1  for  more  details).  Another 
aspect  of  time  and  space  universality  refers  to  the  basic  similarity  of  their  properties  (especially  at  most 

Complex-Dynamic Cosmology and Emergent World Structure                                          11 

fundamental levels) throughout the whole vast, “physically infinite” universe. Postulated as “self-evident” in 
the canonical theory, this very special property finds now its substantiation in the physically unified structure 
of the underlying protofield system and related complex-dynamic synchronisation of all individual quantum 
beat processes (up to phase inversion), which determine the real time flow [4,12,13,17]. 

3.2. Unified dynamic origin of particles, interactions, and constants 

It is important that the two omnipresent, “pervasive” manifestations of unreduced dynamic complexity, space 
and time, emerge  in the protofield  interaction  process in intrinsic unity with the  simplest structures of the 
first level of complexity, elementary field-particles, and their fundamental properties (mass, energy, motion, 
electric  charge,  spin,  etc.),  particle  interactions  with  their  observed  properties  (number,  range,  relative 
magnitude,  unification),  and  dynamical  laws  (quantum  and  classical  mechanics,  special  and  general 
relativity), all of them being now causally and explicitly obtained (derived) from the fundamental interaction 
dynamics  (without  any  “postulates”)  and  thus  naturally  unified  (section  2)  [4,5,11-17].  The  fundamental 
(measured)  properties  of  real  world  structures  are  different,  but  related  measures  of  the  same,  universally 
defined dynamic complexity, while structures themselves and their interactions represent two universal, dual 
forms  of  complexity,  dynamic  entropy  and  dynamic  information,  respectively,  which  are  permanently 
transformed  into  one  another  according  to  the  underlying  unique  “order  of  the  world”,  the  universal 
symmetry  of  complexity.  Omitting  detailed  discussion  of  this  intrinsically  unified  world  structure  and 
dynamics (section 2), we note only the indispensable role of omnipresent dynamic multivaluedness and the 
ensuing chaoticity, diversity (multiplicity) of  forms and adaptability of real  interaction products (absent  in 
any unitary model), starting from the quantum beat process that constitutes the causally complete structure of 
(massive) elementary particles. 

The  related  “difficult”  problems  of  the  unitary  cosmology,  which  are  naturally  resolved  within  our 
complex-dynamical  description,  include  the  well-known  problem  of  the  universe  wavefunction  and  the 
problem  of  quantum  gravity.  The  universe  wavefunction  is  causally  specified  now  as  the  intermediate 
realisation  of  quantum  beat  processes  in  the  physically  unified  protofield  system.  It  naturally  loses  its 
quantum meaning there where classical (bound) systems start to emerge, but the generalised wavefunction 
and Schrödinger equation (see the end of section 2) re-emerge at each higher complexity  level. As for the 
problem  of  quantum  gravity,  our  universal  gravitation  in  general  is  an  indirect  relation  between  naturally 
discrete quantum beat processes through the gravitational protofield and has therefore causal quantum origin 
from the beginning [4,5,12,13,17]. 

An essential novelty of the complex-dynamic cosmology is that it shows the physical origin of so-called 
universal constants and their universality, eventually reduced to the physically unified origin of the universe 
structure. We have seen above (section 2) that one of the constants, the speed of light c, is introduced in our 
theory not as an abstract, postulated “limit to signal speed” (standard relativity), but as a “normal”, physical 
speed of signal propagation in the e/m protofield coupled to the gravitational medium, while time relativity 
and  related  limit  to  signal  propagation  velocity  are  consistently  derived  from  the  underlying  complex 
interaction  dynamics  [4,5,12-17].  We  can  obtain  the  physical  meaning  of  Planck’s  constant  h  and  fine

2e c ). One can see the true origin of the 
extraordinary  universality  of  h,  remaining  totally  “mysterious”  in  the  standard  theory:  the  protofield 
deformation for various particles and processes occurs so that the EP well volume, h, remains the same (for 
the  fixed  protofield  system  parameters  of  a  given  world),  whereas  its  depth  (particle  mass  or  charge)  and 
width (number of realisations or length of virtual soliton jump) can vary considerably. 

Finally, the universal gravitational constant  γ of classical Newton’s law of gravitation is used, together 
 and c, in the canonical expressions for Planckian units, underlying many basic constructions of the 
with 
scholar cosmology and particle theory and giving hugely exaggerated, too big or small units of length, time, 
and mass, separated by many orders of magnitude from any really observed (and all necessary) values (cf. 
e.g. the “hierarchy problem” in the particle mass spectrum). We can see now the origin of those difficulties 
and genuine involvement and meaning of gravity constant: whereas Planckian units describe individual EP 
well (quantum beat) dynamics within each particle, the usual gravitational constant corresponds to indirect, 
much  weaker  interaction  between  different  particles  (quantum  beat  processes)  involving  local  protofield 
parameters  and  gravitational  medium  dynamics.  Therefore  one  should  use  another,  effective  value  of 
0γ , in the Planckian unit combinations, which expresses the direct, much stronger 
“gravitational constant”,

3.3. Self-tuning universe structure 

It  is  evident  already  in  terms  of  general  logic  that  a  dynamically  emerging  universe  should  have  a 
dynamically  consistent,  self-tuning,  adaptable  structure,  since  this  is  the  essence  of  genuine,  autonomous 
structure formation as such. No wonder then that this is the property of complex-dynamic universe structure 
explicitly  obtained  in  the  protofield  interaction  process  (section  2),  as  it  is  demonstrated  by  the  dynamic 
origin of main entities, properties, and universal constants (section 3.2). Moreover, this universal property of 
the  unreduced  complex  dynamics  is  preserved  at  any  higher  level  of  the  emerging  world  structure.  By 
contrast,  it  is  impossible  to  obtain  a  feasible,  stable  universe  structure  in  any  unitary  model,  since  its 
effectively  zero-dimensional  space  does  not  leave  any  possibility  for  intrinsic  adaptability.  Mechanistic 
adjustment of artificially introduced entities and parameters can provide only a basically inefficient substitute 
for dynamical tuning, which gives the well-known “anthropic” difficulties of the unitary cosmology. 

As can be seen from the self-consistent structure of the unreduced EP formalism (eqs. (7)-(12)), a viable 
universe  with  the  same  basic  properties  will  always  emerge  for  generic  protofield  interaction  parameters. 
According to the universal  symmetry of  complexity (section 2), greater quantities of  dynamic  information

Exceptions from generic rules can exist rather for extreme values of protofield interaction magnitude, but 
they  also  find  their  suitable  places  in  the  holistic  complex-dynamical  world  picture.  Ultimately  strong 
protofield  interaction  will  create  a  macroscopically  large,  “many-particle”  protofield  “collapse”  that  may 
have  a  number  of  different  degrees  [4],  from  a  partially  coherent  “condensate”  of  elementary  particles 
(“superdense” cosmic objects, such as “neuron stars”), which is still a part of “ordinary” reality, to the total 
protofield collapse down to their “pre-interaction” state of the unique “proto-matter”, which does not contain 
anything from this world and should be considered as effective nothingness with respect to it. Contrary, to 
abstract and contradictory “exact solutions” of the unitary theory (such as “black holes”), each of these states 
can  be  provided  with  the  causal,  physically  specified  basis  of  its  origin  and  structure,  showing  qualitative 
correlations with a number of observed “exotic” objects of the universe (e.g. quasars) and their features. The 
case of ultimately weak protofield interaction corresponds to small fluctuations of their structure that cannot 
transform into real, massive matter and may account for either “primordial” state of the protofields or, more 
realistically, observed universe state away from any massive matter, in the “vacuum”, including propagating 
ordinary photons  and  in particular the so-called  “microwave radiation  background” related  in the standard 
cosmology to the “remnants” of the first stages of the Big Bang and its properties.§ We see now that in the 
causally  emerging,  interaction-driven  universe  structure  such  “vacuum  fluctuations”  are  inevitable  and 
should not be directly related to a particular universe dynamics or evolution feature. 

Note  finally  the  huge,  exponentially  large  efficiency  of  complex-dynamic  adaptability  (self-tuning) 
process:  it  is  due  to  the  unceasingly  breeding  and  permanently  changing  realisations  of  the  probabilistic 
dynamical  fractal  (section  2),  which  gives  rise  to the  real-time,  “fantastically  efficient”  exploration  by  the 
system of (almost) all existing possibilities for structure development [5]. 

4. Unified complex-dynamic solution to the problems 
of mass, energy, and entropy 

4.1. Universe energy positivity and the time arrow 

According  to  the  universal  symmetry  (conservation)  of  complexity  (see  the  end  of  section  2),  the  total 
dynamic complexity does not change in a structure emergence process, but is transformed instead from its 
“latent”  (but  real  and  positively  defined)  form  of  dynamic  information  (universally  expressed  by  the 
generalised action quantity) into the “unfolded” form of dynamic entropy. Therefore any “compensation” of 
the positive total energy of moving bodies by the negative energy of their gravitational attraction, giving zero 

                                                        
§Note that some  versions of the unitary theory make reference to  vacuum fluctuations of “zero-point field” or “space-time 
foam” as being due to formal solutions of eventually postulated equations. We should emphasize the totally causal origin of 
our  weak  interaction  limit  within  the  same  interaction  process  between  two  protofields  but  at  small  values  of  effective 
coupling, for which any essentially nonlinear protofield deformation, and therefore quantum beat dynamics, is impossible. 

 

14                                                                         Andrei P. Kirilyuk 

value of total energy, as it is implied by the unitary cosmology, is impossible in the real world dynamics. In 
fact, this  “zero-energy  solution”  is  due  to the  zero-complexity  reduction  of  the  dynamically  single-valued 
model of the standard theory. By contrast, the inevitable positivity of the total complexity-energy of any real 
system is due to its dynamically multivalued, and therefore chaotic, dynamics, where the “thermal energy” of 
chaotic realisation change always determines the large positive balance of the total energy.

  and  with 

  (because  of  dynamic  multivalued-ness) 

This  energy  positivity  condition  is  directly  related  to  the  direction  of  the  arrow  of  time  (and  the  very 
existence of time flow), by a rigorously derived and absolutely universal relation of eq. (22), which means 
that the positive stock of total energy-complexity gives rise to the flow of time as such, since for the system 
t∆ >   only  if 
globally  at  rest, 
0E > .  In  other  words,  a  universe  with  zero  total  energy  could  not  exist  at  all,  in  any  configuration. 
Moreover, a small positive energy will give rise to proportionally small mass-energy content of the universe. 
This  fundamentally  substantiated  conclusion  about  the  real,  dynamically  multivalued  universe  emergence 
and structure puts an end to various formal postulates and hypotheses of unitary cosmology about possibility 
of universe appearance from nothing by a sort of “quantum tunneling”, or “vacuum fluctuation”, based on 
the  assumption  about  zero  total  energy  (where  positive  mass-energy  of  “matter”  is  compensated  by  the 
negative energy of gravitational attraction). Such is the well-known Wheeler-De Witt equation and related 
ideas  of  the  unitary  “quantum  cosmology”.  Even  when  a  unitary  theory  inserts  a  positive  energy  in  its 
formally postulated equations, it does not see the genuine physical origin and meaning of both energy/mass 
and  its  positivity,  losing  the  main,  chaotic  part  of  system  dynamics.  Indeed,  the  assumed  unitary 
“compensation”  is  impossible  because  the  dynamically  multivalued,  chaotic  part  of  any  dynamics  adds  a 
dominating positive part to the total energy balance. We shall see that this loss of the main part of energy and 
motion  in  the  unitary  theory  underlies  all  “difficult”  problems  of  cosmology  and  astrophysics:  mass  and 
energy are lost in the unitary universe models from the beginning, and there is no wonder that various aspects 
of this basic deficiency emerge inevitably with growing precision and completeness of measurements. 

Another  aspect  of  the  positive  complexity-energy  and  time  arrow  of  a  real  universe  is  a  permanent, 
strictly positive growth of dynamic entropy accompanying any structure emergence, which resolves the old 
contradiction  of  the  unitary  science  between  the  “second  law”  and  apparently  “growing  order”  during 
structure formation. Any unitary structure is basically regular only because of artificial limitation (dynamic 
single-valuedness)  of  the  unitary  theory  itself,  while  the  unreduced  analysis  of  structure  creation  process 
shows  (section  2)  that  any,  even  most  externally  regular  structure,  can  appear  and  exist  only  due  to  the 
dominating  internal  chaoticity  of  its  (very  similar)  realisation  change  (which  is  a  limiting  regime  of 
“multivalued  self-organisation”)  [4-7].  It  is  yet  more  important  that  this  omnipresent  entropy  growth 
constitutes only a part of the whole symmetry, or conservation, of complexity (again contrary to the unitary 
science paradigm), since it occurs at the expense of equal decrease of the initial dynamic information of the 
system interaction configuration. The universe, its real structure, evolution, and any part dynamics are based, 
therefore,  on  the  absolutely  general  and  exact  (never  broken)  principle  of  symmetry,  the  symmetry  of 
(unreduced)  complexity,  constituting  thus  the  genuine  Order  of  the  World  that  possesses  the  intrinsic, 
autonomous structure creation power. 

4.2. Locally missing mass: unitary model deficiency 

The  so-called  dark  mass  problem  involves  various  observation  data  showing  that  local  cosmic  structure 
dynamics (mostly for galaxies) would need much larger (from several to hundreds times more) quantities of 
ordinary,  massive  matter,  than  those  that  can  actually  be  viewed  or  deduced  within  any  reasonable 
assumption  (see  e.g.  refs.  [25-27]).    Big  variation  of  the  missing  mass  effect  between  various  cosmic 
structures is another characteristic, and puzzling, feature of the problem. We can show that these difficulties 
of  the  unitary  theory  originate  from  the  same  its  incorrect  neglect  of  the  main,  chaotic  part  of  system 
dynamics,  now  occurring  at  the  level  of  a  local  cosmic  object  dynamics.  If  one  considers  the  real, 
dynamically multivalued system behaviour, the problem will not appear and the truly chaotic dynamics of 
real  objects  will  account  for  observed  dynamical  features  with  the  “visible”,  normal  mass  values.  It  is 
important  that  one  should  take  into  account  the  genuine,  dynamically  multivalued  chaos  in  a  many-body 
system, rather than one of its unitary imitations by an “involved”, but basically regular behaviour. 

Complex-Dynamic Cosmology and Emergent World Structure                                          15 

The main idea is physically straightforward: because of artificial cut of all system realisations but one in 
the unitary theory (this is an exponentially big reduction for a many-body system), one obtains inevitably a 
“missing  motion”  problem,  which  is  interpreted  as  mysteriously  “missing  mass”  within  the  same  unitary 
imitation. One can specify this result in various ways, and we start with a demonstration of incompleteness of 
the  conventional  “virial  theorem”  application  to  the  real,  multivalued  dynamics  of  a  many-body  system, 
since  it  shows  how  the  major  “balance”  between  potential  and  kinetic  energy  can  be  modified  for  the 
unreduced system dynamics. 

If  system  components  move  under  the  influence  of  gravitational  attraction,  e.g.  in  a  galaxy,  then  the 
ordinary  virial  theorem  gives  the  following  relation  between  the  time-averaged  values  of  kinetic  T   and 
potential U  energy of a system or any its component (see e.g. [28]):

But when observations are interpreted within the unitary, deficient version of dynamics, eq. (30), stating that

Therefore, the observed discrepancy can be used, within the complex-dynamic interpretation, for estimation

The observed big variations of “dark mass” effects for different objects represent a “heavy” difficulty for 
practically any explanation in terms of additional, “invisible” entities, but are, on the contrary, quite natural 
for the above explanation by the true (multivalued) chaos effects that should be very variable. Moreover,  one 
can trace apparent qualitative correlation between the expected object chaoticity (irregular structure, etc.), its 
spatial dependence, and the observed magnitude of “missing mass” effects (extended verification is certainly 
necessary).  One  may  note  also  that  it  is  much  more  consistent  to  explain  an  observed,  variable  system 
property by a fundamental property of its dynamics, rather than by a new, strangely escaping (and inevitably 
fixed) entity (this refers also to the general interpretation of the property of mass in the universal science of 
complexity and unitary field theory [4,5,12-17]). One should also take into account the spatial dependence of 
chaotic motion and mass distribution effects (or “structural” chaos) that tend to accumulate just outside of the 
main  mass  and  interaction  concentration  in  the  system  (especially  for  those  with  a  “centred  rotation” 
configuration),  in  agreement  with  observation  data  interpretation  using  eqs.  (37).  Note  finally  the  deep 
conceptual  relation  between  the  missing  mass  effects  at  different  levels  of  world  dynamics,  the  missing 
(total)  mass-energy  of  the  universe  (section  4.1),  missing  dynamic  origin  of  elementary  particle  mass 
(replaced by the artificially introduced new entity of “Higgs boson”), and the “dark mass” effects at the level 
of  cosmic  objects,  vs.  the  common,  universally  valid  and  consistent  solution  of  all  those  problems  in  the 
universal science of complexity in terms of multivalued, chaotic dynamics of any real system. 

4.3. Globally missing energy and Big Bang contradictions: deficient linearity 

The origin of the globally missing, “distributed” energy, or “dark energy” [25-27], that could also be called 
“missing  universe  acceleration”,  is  directly  related  to  the  vicious  circle  of  the  unitary  cosmology  scheme 
centred  on  the  Big  Bang  hypothesis,  or  “exploding  vacuum”  solution.  Indeed,  the  latter  starts  from 
postulated,  artificially  imposed  nothingness  of  the  essential  universe  content  (section  4.1),  in  the  form  of 
dynamically  single-valued,  zero-complexity  reduction  of  universe  dynamics  (irrespective  of  particular 
“model”  details).  Because  of  the  intrinsic  instability  of  that  intrinsically  fixed,  static  construction,  one  is 
obliged to  further  impose a  mechanistic  “general  expansion” (or the reverse  squeeze) of the universe  as  a 
single  possible  mode  of  its  (totally  illusive)  “development”.  The  choice  for  expansion,  or  Big  Bang,  is 
justified  by a  particular interpretation of the observed  “red shift” effect (the  interpretation that  involves  a 
number of serious contradictions in itself). However, the intrinsic conceptual instability of any unitary model 
(absence  of  adaptable  degrees  of  freedom)  persists  in  the  form  of  multiple  particular  (and  well-known) 
problems  of  the  Big  Bang  model  whose  proposed  “solutions”  only  transfer  the  difficulties  to  other 
formulations or artificially  introduced entities. The  “dark energy” problem represents only the  latest in the 
list,  though  scandalously  big  and  long  hidden,  rupture  in  the  basically  frustrated  construction:  a  slightly 
uneven red-shift dependence on distance leads to a huge deficiency in the source of corresponding uneven 
expansion, supposed to be a distributed stock of mysterious, invisible energy that should inevitably take very 
exotic,  normally  impossible  forms.  This  final,  and  apparently  “definite”,  impasse  of  missing  energy  (and 
mass) content of the universe simply returns  us to the  beginning of the unitary  vicious circle, where  such 
emptiness  of  the  universe  content  has  been  explicitly  inserted  by  the  unitary  paradigm  (this  is  but  a 
degenerate case of the complexity conservation law, astonishing in its long-lasting simplification,  0

0= ). 

By  contrast,  the  unreduced,  dynamically  multivalued  and  probabilistically  fractal  structure  of  real 
interaction dynamics  leads to globally  stable concept of universe  structure development,  just  because  it  is 
based  on  omnipresent  and  massively  adaptable  local,  dynamic  instability.  The  explicit  universe  structure 
emergence  in the  initially  homogeneous  system of  interacting protofields, starting  from the physically  real 
space, time, and elementary particles, intrinsically unified with their fundamental properties and interactions, 
can be described as a distributed implosion of ubiquitous structure creation, as opposed to mechanistic, and 
intrinsically destructive, rather than creative, explosion of the Big Bang (and “inflation”) schemes. 

Therefore the “dark energy” problem does not even appear in the complex-dynamic, intrinsically creative 
cosmology.  The  self-tuning  universe  structure,  liberated  from  unitary  instabilities  and  related  “anthropic” 
speculations, emerges naturally and self-consistently, simply due to the unreduced, truly “exact” picture of 
the underlying generic interaction. As for the origin of the observed red shift effect in radiation spectra of 
distant objects, it finds its consistent explanation  in terms of nonlinear radiation propagation properties in 
the  system  of  coupled  protofields,  where  some  (relatively  weak)  loss  of  energy  by  soliton-like  photons, 

Complex-Dynamic Cosmology and Emergent World Structure                                          17 

propagating in the e/m protofield medium, is inevitable because of their irreducible, though relatively small, 
coupling  to  the  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  gravitational  medium.  Note  the  essential  difference  of  this 
nonlinear  energy  dissipation  mechanism  and  result  from  linear  scattering  effects  in  any  ordinary, 
“corpuscular”  model.  The  soliton-like  photon,  remaining  stabilised  by  interaction  with  the  gravitational 
protofield, can slowly give its energy to the gravitational degrees of freedom without any noticeable change 
of  its  direction  of  propagation  (i.e.  without  any  resulting  “blur”  effects  in  the  distant  object  images). 
Characteristic  “transpiercing”  and  “circumventing”  modes  of  soliton  interaction  with  “weak”  enough 
obstacles can explain anomalously small loss and angular deviation effects for photons and very high-energy 
particles (see below). Detailed calculations of the effect will inevitably involve many unknown parameters of 
the system, but qualitative properties and consistency of the whole picture provide convincing evidence in 
favour of this explanation of the red shift effect and its further refinement. 

In particular, the nonlinear red shift dependence on distance that gives rise to catastrophic consequences 
in  the  unitary  cosmology  paradigm  can  only  be  natural  in  the  complex-dynamical,  essentially  nonlinear 
picture  (section  2).  The  nonlinear  energy-loss  mechanism  of  soliton-like  photons  explains  why  this  loss 
grows more slowly with distance, than any usual mechanism of diffuse scattering would imply (cf. the above 
note  on  soliton  scattering  dynamics).  Similar  dynamics  could  solve,  by  the  way,  the  persisting  puzzle  of 
GZK  effect  for  the  ultra-relativistic  particles,  since  at  those  super-high  energies  the  motion  of  a  massive 
particle approaches that of (a group of) photons, according to the results of quantum field mechanics [4,12-
17]. Another, though maybe less important, feature of red-shift data correlating with our explanation is the 
apparent growth of average scatter of data points with distance. 

5. Conclusion 

Returning to the general picture of our emerging universe, note once  more that  it does  not contain any 
“motion-on-circles” dynamics, including structure creation processes, so that the initial amount of dynamic 
information, in the form of protofield interaction, gives rise to generalised, complex-dynamical system birth, 
followed by its gradual, irreversible, and “global” transformation into dynamic entropy (structure creation) 
representing  a  universally  defined,  finite  system  life,  which  ends  up  in  the  state  of  generalised  death,  or 
equilibrium, around the total transformation of the initial dynamic information into entropy (unless additional 
dynamic  information  is  introduced  into  the  system)  [4].  The  generalised  “potential  energy”  of  interacting 
protofields can be introduced e.g. by their explicit separation from the “pre-existing” state of “totally unified” 
(mixed) protofields that could have the form of a generally inert quark-gluon “condensate” in its “absolute” 
ground state (but these “prehistoric” assumptions are subject to inevitable uncertainty and can be estimated 
rather by general consistency and parsimony principles). What appears to be much more certain, however, is 
that one does need an initial form of “potential” interaction energy, universally specified here as “dynamic 
information”,  since  birth  of  a  structured,  real  universe  from  genuine  “nothingness”,  without  any  real 
interaction  development  (which  is  the  preferred  dogma  of  the  conventional  unitarity),  does  not  fit  into 
fundamentally substantiated and universally confirmed symmetry of complexity. 

Finally,  we  may  summarise  various  additional  evidence  in  favour  of  our  complex-dynamical  universe 
description,  whose  consistent  interpretation  within  the  standard,  unitary  cosmology  paradigm  seems  much 
less probable. The highly uneven, long-distance concentration of anomalous, super-intense “quasar” sources 
of energy (as well as their “peculiar” red-shift tendency) points to a (probably moving) “shape of the world”, 
which looks quite natural in our interacting protofield logic, while it would need an additional, “unnatural” 
assumption  in  the  Big  Bang  logic  of  “exploding  emptiness”.  Growing  contradictions  about the  age  of  the 
universe and its separate components can be naturally solved in our complex-dynamic cosmology, while the 
unitary theory seems to encounter  here another series of  its  inbred  “instabilities” (due to the rigidly  fixed, 
mechanistic data fit). The same refers to structural contradictions of the omnipresent expansion hypothesis 
and natural elimination in our approach of this and other “old” difficulties of the unitary theory, such as the 
average space flatness and homogeneity (some others are mentioned above and all are well-known). Intrinsic 
unification with realistic, universal solution of the stagnating problems of quantum mechanics, field theory, 
and relativity (sections 2, 3) constitutes the unique feature of our theory that, being certainly desirable, cannot 
be even expected for any existing or future version of the unitary imitation of world dynamics.

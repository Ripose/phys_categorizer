It is a striking result the one found by Wang, Kuzmich & Dogariu 1 (see also 2)

experimentally last year, that a pulse of light, entered into an atomic caesium

(Cs) vapour cell, appeared at the exit before its entrance (!) by 62 nanoseconds. It

has to be mentioned that the shape of the pulse was maintained (cf. fig. 4 of 1), so

that its peak was not shifted forward inside the pulse. Thus the explanation that

the peak of the pulse was advanced at the exit, with the result of emerging there

before the entrance of the peak of the incident pulse, does not apply.

This “strange” effect was due to an observed negative group-velocity index  ng  ≈

≈  -330  (while the group-velocity index implied by the 62 nanoseconds is ng ≈ -310).

In order to achieve this index the researchers mentioned used a double emission line,

namely the 852 nm caesium D2 line, and found how the optical refractive index n(n )

had   to   vary   between   (and   closed   to)   the   two   lines   of   the   doublet   theoretically,

constructing a theoretical curve which was calculated from the appropriate theoretical

formula (eq. (1) of 1) after giving to the parameters values obtained experimentally.(*)

This curve fitted perfectly the experimental data on values of the optical refractive

index in the anomalous dispersion region studied. But because of the encountered

sufficiently  negative   slope   of   n(ν),   almost   constant,   between   the   two   lines   of   the

doublet, a negative ng resulted (ng ≈ -330) from the formula giving it, namely ng = n(ν)

+ νdn(ν)/dν. And it is evident that a negative group-velocity index cannot be derived

theoretically by any known means, starting from causality, as we will see in what

follows.

It   is   argued   by  Wang,   Kuzmich   &   Dogariu   that   this   “strange”   effect   can   be

explained by the wave nature of light, without having to violate causality. They write1:

“…interference between different frequency components [of the pulse] produces this

rather counterintuitive effect”. They clearly tacitly assume that the information travels

at the phase-velocity speed. But this is not correct. It is evident that information, like

energy, travels at the speed of the pulse as a whole (evenmore since its shape does not

change). And the latter is nothing else than the velocity of propagation of the pulse,

which has to be taken equal to its  group-velocity4(p.291), which can never become

negative for motion forward in time, as we will see in what follows.

Also, it has to be noted that the equation describing the anomalous dispersion

region (eq. (1) of 1) is indeed resulting from the Kramers-Kronig relations4,5, which in

turn is based undoubtedly on causality, described by the relation  ct – x > 0, whence

0 < x / t < c, where x is the distance traveled by the pulse in time t ( x > 0). This is to

say  that   the   pulse´s   front   travels   with   positive   velocity  less   than   c.   This   pulse´s

velocity is just the group-velocity dω / dk = x / t, where ω is the cyclic frequency and

k is the wave number. Thus, because of causality, we have to impose the condition

0 < υg ≡ dω / dk < c, for  x > 0 . In other words, causality establishes that the signal

cannot propagate with a velocity greater than c (cf. 5 §7.11c). Of course we could have

υg negative, this fact meaning that the pulse propagates from the receiver to the emitter

( x < 0 ). But, because the emitter looses energy while the receiver gains energy, this is

impossible. Thus, in the case of negative υg  here, the only thing that we can conclude

is that the pulse propagates from the emitter to the receiver ( x > 0 ) but  moving

backwards in time! ( t < 0 ). Of course, on the other hand, for the group-velocity index

ng, given by  ng = c / υg , we should have  ng > 1 ( > 0 ). In other words, for  x > 0 , we

can never have  υg < 0 (or ng < 0 ), if we insist on causality! 

Thus the condition  ct – x > 0  (with  x > 0) (causality) must necessarily lead to

positive υg (and ng), that is to x and t of the same sign (so  t > 0). This means that the

very fact of Wang, Kuzmich & Dogariu finding a negative υg  (and ng) (with x > 0)

undoubtedly implies a violation of causality in the particular case! The big problem is

then   to   understand   the   evidently   non-causal   character   of   the   effect   discovered

experimentally by Wang, Kuzmich & Dogariu. And to this end, an insight is given by

the invariance of the space-time interval (in one dimension), namely by the fact that

the expression  c 2 t 2 – x 2  retains the same value independently of the frame used 6     (

§ 2 ). Thus, in order for causality to hold, it is necessary that  c 2 t 2 – x 2 > 0 , that is

the space-time interval to be time-like. But this relation can be written as  ( c t – x) ·

· ( c t + x) > 0 . Thus, it is necessary that the binomials  c t – x  and  c t + x  are of the

same sign. The case where  c t – x > 0  &  c t + x > 0  right describes what we call

causality. If υ is the velocity, then, for  x > 0 , c t – x > 0 implies  υ < 0 and, for  x < 0,

c t + x > 0  implies  υ > - c , that is causality implies  - c < υ < c . For motion in the

positive x-direction of course  υ > 0 , while for motion in the negative x-direction we

will have  υ < 0 .

But for the space-time interval  c 2 t 2 – x 2  to be time-like ( > 0) it is not necessary

for both  c t – x  &  c t + x  to be positive (causality). We can evidently have also  c t –

- x  < 0  &  c t + x < 0 , from a theoretical point of view. We may then say that, in this

case, a principle of anti-causality holds (for particles obeying these two conditions). If

then again υ is the velocity of such a particle, for  x < 0 , the condition  c t – x < 0  (or

- c t + x > 0 ) implies that  υ < c , while, for  x > 0 , the condition  c t + x < 0 (or - c t –

- x > 0 ) implies that  υ > - c , that is again anti-causality (now) implies  - c < υ < c .

But  now   for  motion  in   the  positive   x-direction    υ  <  0  ,   while  for   motion   in  the

negative x-direction   υ > 0 . This is the case because now   t < 0 , that is we have

motion backwards in time!

Combination of both principles of causality and of anti-causality would give a

principle of generalized causality as  ( c t – x )  ( c t + x ) > 0 ,  or  c  2  t 2  – x  2  > 0 ,

which would state simply that the radius vector   ( c t ,   x )   be  time-like!   Then of

course both principles, once they were valid in one frame, they would be valid in any

other frame, because of relativistic covariance. Thus, tachyons would not follow either

of the two principles, that is the generalized one, as defining space-like radius vectors.

In another way, according  to the generalized causality principle, namely  c 2  t 2   –

- x 2 > 0 ,  we would simply have  c > │ x / t │ , or again  - c < υ < c  for any allowed

velocity. And if we have   υ > 0   (with x positive) we will have to do with motion

forward in time ( t > 0), while, if we had  υ < 0 (with x positive),  we would have to

do with motion  backwards in time!  ( t < 0). The latter is clearly the case on hand,

since we have found  υ < 0  ( x  &  t  of opposite signs, with x positive). The specific

value found, namely  υ = - c / 310 ,  clearly satisfies the condition - c < υ < 0  ( x > 0),

that is  the principle  of  anti-causality  holds  in our case!  Concerning the refractive

index, since      - c < υg < c , it is easy to see that  ng > 1 ( x > 0) for motion forward in

time, while   ng  < -1 ( x > 0) for motion backwards in time. The latter condition is

satisfied here, since  ng = -310.

A last remark only. In the case of motion backwards in time (anti-causality), it can

be easily shown that the Kramers-Kronig relations become:

Re n(ω) + 1 = (2/π) P ∫dώ [ώ Im n(ώ)] / [ώ2 – ω2]                                                    

Im n(ω) = - (2ω/π) P ∫dώ [Re n(ώ) + 1] / [ώ2 – ω2] ,

where P means “principal part”, and the integrations are taken from 0 to - ∞ . I intend

to prove them in another paper.

Abstract 
 

 

 

 

Coulomb  explosion  is  revisited  on  the  basis  of  explosion  theory.  The  characteristics  of 

the  Coulomb  explosion  such  as  the  ion  kinetic  energy,  the  energy  distribution  function, 

the  laser  absorption  length  along  with  the  neutron  yield  are  determined.  The  model 

explains reasonably well the experimental results. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

High intensity femto-second laser pulse matter interaction has revealed a new host 

of  phenomena  with  tremendous  potential  applications.  During  laser- molecule  and  laser-

cluster  interaction,  electrons  are  stripped  off  the  particulates  that  explode  subsequently 

under  the  influence  of  the  stored  electrostatic  energy.  The  laser-cluster  interaction 

exhibits characteristic features, which allows one to rank it as a transition between laser-

gas  and  laser-solid  interactions.  The  Coulomb  explosion  generates  bright  keV  x-ray 

photons,  highly  energetic  electrons  and  very  fast  ions  that  are  emitted  along  the  laser 
polarization for exploding molecules, but are isotropically emitted for  clusters1-8 . Many 

applications  based  on  Coulomb  explosion  have  been  pointed  out,  such  as  i/  Coulomb 

explosion imaging, where a fast triatomic molecular ion impinges on a thin foil that strip 

off the electrons, leading to the repulsion of the positively  charged remnants and freezing 

of the velocities up to an imaging detector where the initial molecular structure may be 

traced  back,  ii/  source  of  soft  and  hard  x-rays  ,  the  x-ray  yield  may  be  cluster  size  and 

density  of  clusters  dependent,  iii/  source  of  pulsed  and  fast  neutrons  generated  in 

appropriate gas jets, like those containing deuterium  (D) or tritium  (T). The neutrons are 

the result of D-D or D-T interactions of fast elements ejected from different clusters. The 

neutron  yield  depends  on  cluster  size  and  laser  parameters,  iv/  or  simply  a  way  for 

achieving fusion, since exploding clusters provide sufficient kinetic energy for deuterons 

to  trigger  a  fusion  reaction.  An  alternative  would  be  the  use  of  the  energetic  ions  for 
heating a pre-compressed D-T pellet up to ignition9-12 . 

Depending on the cluster size rc and the electron excursion x e under the influence 

of the laser electric field, the expansion of the ionized cluster may be seen as a Coulomb 
explosion  (rc<<x e)  or  an  ambipolar  expansion  (rc>>x e).  The  theories  developed  so  far  to 
explain  all  the  features  of  the  Coulomb  explosion  are  based  on  the  second  category.  In 

this  letter  however,  we  believe  since  we  are  coping  with  a  Coulomb  explosion,  it  is 

appropriate  to  tackle  the  problem  through  the  explosion  theory  rather  than  the  sudden 

expansion  of  a  cloud.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  we  retrieve  almost  all  the  experimental  facts 

pointed out in  Coulomb explosion experiments. 

 

Consider  a  gas  of  numerical  density  na,  comprising  nc  clusters  per  unit  volume. 

The cluster has numerical density n0 and radius rc. A laser pulse interacts with the gas, 

The laser field tunnel ionizes the atoms of the cluster and imparts quiver velocity to the

consequently  electrons  move  out  of  the  cluster  forming  an  electron  cloud.  During  this 

time, the positive ions are immobile over the entire sphere of radius rc. Let’s recall, that to 

bring  about  a  number  of  positive  charges  from  infinity  to  form  one  system,  we  should 

perform a work.  If the cluster is not maintained by a balancing force, it will restitute the 

stored or the electrostatic energy back to the surrounding environment. To calculate the 

stored energy in the cluster of positive ions aggregating in a sphere, we consider the work 

done in bringing the positive charges from infinity to form a crystal, that is given by,

where  a  is  the  inter- ion  distance.  Unfortunately,  this  form  is  not  tractable  since  the 

harmonic  infinite  series  is  divergent.  We  approximate  then,  the  energy  stored  by  this 

finite  number  of  ions,  by  the  energy  stored  in  a  positively  charged  sphere  of  radius  rc,

,  for  big  clusters  the  explosion  is  driven  by  the  electrostatic  energy 

stored in the  sphere rather than by the space-charge field. When all electrons have been 

removed,  the  energy  stored  in  the  positive  ions  sphere,  has  to  be  restituted  in  an 

explosively manner. The outer surface ions will move radially in the electron cloud with

Equation  (11),  reveals  that  ions  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  cluster  get  higher  kinetic 
energy.  For  the  parameters  of  Ditmire  et  al’s  experiment,  n0  =3x1022  cm-3,   rc=50Å,

  It  is 

revealed that the maximum kinetic energy is a quadratic function of the cluster size and

The average kinetic energy is given straightforwardly by,

where rc1 and rc2 are the minimum and maximum radii of the clusters. 

By  stripping  off  the  electrons,  the  laser  pulse  acted  as  an  operator  that  rubes  matches 

against  a  rugous  surface  to  ignite  a  combustion  reaction,  which  in  turn  provides  more 

energy. To calculate the absorption length, one should evaluate the energy given by the 

laser to the clouds of electrons in all the clusters. 

By virtue of Eq.(2), we calculate the energy provided by the laser pulse to each electron,

This length is independent of the laser intensity because it is calculated for a maximum 
electron  depletion  of  the  cluster.  For  the  parameters,  n0  =  1022  cm-3,  rc=50Å, 
IL=1016W/cm2, ôL =35fs, if one takes nc=1017 cm-3, the attenuation length turns out to be 

L// = 33  ìm. This length is shorter than the length of the gas column containing clusters. 

Hence experimental value of 90% laser energy absorption is consistent with our model. 

Full absorption of laser energy does not occur as a reduced intensity laser pulse can not 

cause tunnel ionization of atoms and propagates unaffected after its level has fallen below 

the threshold for tunnel ionization. 

Coulomb  explosion  generates  a  hot  ions  component  in  addition  to  the  cold  one  already 

present  in  the  plasma.  In  the  case  of  deuterium  plasma  jets,  the  hot  deuterons  would 

collide with others of the surrounding media, to achieve fusion reactions, which give rise 

consequently  to  neutrons.  To  calculate  the  number  of  neutrons  generated  by  the  laser 

pulse,  we  first  determine  the  effective  number  of  energetic  ions  undergoing  a 

thermonuclear  reaction.  The  number  of  energetic  ions  produced  via  cluster  Coulomb 

explosion by a laser pulse of spot size r0 is given by,

L(cid:31)=100ìm, nn=0.44x105 neutron per joule of laser energy. 
 

To  conclude,  during  the  interaction  of  high  intensity  femto-second  laser  pulses  with 

clusters,  the  electrons  execute  large  excursions,  leaving  the  positive  cluster  charge 

uncompensated. Under the effect of the stored electrostatic energy, large clusters explode 
releasing  energetic  ions.  The  calculations  reveal14    that  ions  on  the  outer  surface  of  the 

cluster get higher kinetic energy, and  that the energy is distributed according to a square 

rooted law. Coulomb explosion is triggered by the laser pulse; hence the laser energy is 

absorbed  on  a  length  that  has  been  determined  in  favor  of  experimental  facts.  In  case 

deuterium  gas  jets  are  considered,  the  release  of  energetic  ions  may  trigger  fusion 

reactions  with  the  surrounding  low  energy  ions,  with  a  subsequent  neutron  production. 

Proton release should be also expected.

Abstract. Compton scattering is usually explained in terms of the 

relativistic mass and momentum. Here, a mathematically equivalent and 

simple non-relativistic interpretation shows that the Compton frequency 

shift is equal to the de Broglie frequency associated with the moving 

charged particle (e.g., an electron). In this work, the moving electron is 

considered as a particle and the electromagnetic energy associated with it is 

shown to be proportional to the de Broglie frequency. This energy is 

released when its motion is arrested, as for example on a diffraction screen, 

where it causes the observed interfernce patterns. Thus, electrons transport 

electromagnetic energy from a source to a sink. 

Key words: Compton shift, de Broglie wavelength, wave/particle duality, 

transport of electromagnetic energy 

An introduction to Compton effect can be found in many books, e.g., see 

[1]. A bibliography on the various interpretations using relativistic and 

quantum theories can be found in [2]. Here, a simple non-relativistic view of 

the phenomenon is presented.  

    Essentially, in Compton scattering, an incident X-ray of wavelength 

 

 

 

 

 

 

λin interacts with matter and the scattered ray has a longer wave length λθ, 

the value of which depends on the scattering angle θ from the incident ray. 

In the case of interaction with electrons, the Compton wavelength shift ∆λe,θ 

is given by [1],  

∆λe,θ = λθ - λin = λC,e(1- cos θ)                                                                              (1) 

where λC,e, the Compton wavelength (obtained as the Compton shift for 

θ = π/2) is found to be, 

λC,e = (h/mec) [= (I/me) = 2π(e2/κvω)(1/mec)]                                      (2)        

h is the Planck constsnt and me is the rest mass of the electron. The 

equivalent terms introduced here in the square brackets consist of I = (h/c) 

(= λC,eme), the moment of inertia of the electron with respect to a point at a 

distance de = λC,e, κ = 4πεo (where εo = 1/µoc2 = 1/Zc is the electric 

permittivty, µo is the magnetic permeability and Z is the impedance of 

vacuum), (e2/κvω) = ħ = h/2π, the angular momentum of spin is the product 

of charge (e) and magnetic pole strength (e/κvω) of the spinning unit charge, 

vω = αc, is the velocity of spin (due to the electromagnetic torque arising 

from the mutually perpendicular electric and magnetic fields) and α is the 

fine structure constant.     

    The energy lost by the incident X-ray is, as per relativity theory [1], due 

to a gain in the mass (δm)θ of the (recoil) electron, whereas here it is 

explained in (mathematically equivalent) terms of the gain in the linear 

velocity, ve,θ of the electron. 

respectively by, 

The equations for the conservation of energy and momentum are given 

h(νin (cid:150) νθ) = h∆νe,θ = (δm)θc2 = me(γθ - 1)c2 = mecve,θ                                   (3)    

(h/c)∆νe,θ = h[(1/λi) - (1/λθ)] = (δm)θc = me(γθ (cid:150) 1)c = meve,θ            (4)  

where νin and νθ are the frequencies and γθ is the relativity factor. The last 

terms in equations (3) and (4) imply that an electron initially at rest with 

velocity vo = 0 (or having a constant initial velocity, vo) gains the velocity 

ve,θ = c(γθ (cid:150) 1) at the expense of the energy h∆νe,θ lost by the incident X-ray.  

    The wavelength λdB,e,θ, frequency νdB,e,θ and period  τdΒ,e,θ οf the de 

Broglie wave of the electron in motion are given by,  

 

λdB,e,θ = (h/meve,θ) = c/(∆νe,θ) = cλC,e/ve,θ                                            (5)           

λdB,e,θ/c = 1/νdB,e,θ = 1/∆νe,θ  = λC,e/ve,θ = τdΒ,e,θ                                    (6)  

νin = νθ + νdB,e,θ                                                                                    (7) 

 

 

 

These equations show that the de Broglie wave is an electromagnetic wave 

of velocity c and that the Compton frequency shift (∆νe,θ) is equal to the 

frequency νdB,e,θ of the de Broglie wave. The energy hνdB,e,θ of the de 

Broglie wave is the electromagnetic energy associated with the moving 

electron, which it received from the incident electromagnetic wave.          

     Note that when the moving electron is brought to rest (or to its original 

velocity vo), the electromagnetic energy will be released by the electron. 

Thus, a moving electron transports electromagnetic energy from a source to 

a sink. In diffraction experiments such as those by Davisson and Germer 

mentioned in [1] as a demonstration of the wave nature of electrons, actually 

electrons emitted from the source lose their momentum on coming to a rest 

on the screen and the electromagnetic energy released appears in the form of 

waves which cause the interference pattern. Therefore, note that the present 

work shows that electrons can be treated as particles and not as waves. 

     It also follows from equations (2) and (6) that,  

λC,e = de = ve,θτdΒ,e,θ = h/mec = I/me                                                     (8) 

where de is a fixed distance and is the product of the velocity ve,θ  and the 

period τdΒ,e,θ of one de Broglie wave. If vω is considered as the spinning 

velocity acting on the distance de, the angular velocity of spin ωe and the 

corresponding energy are given respectively by, 

ωe = vω/de = αc/λC,e.= αmec2/h                                                           (9) 

ħωe = ħvω/de = ħαc/λC,e = αmec2/2π                                                 (10)

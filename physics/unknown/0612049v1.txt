Differential Error Region of a Quantity Depended on Full One-Port Network 

Analyser Measurements 

N.I. Yannopoulou and P.E. Zimourtopoulos 

An analytical method was developed to estimate errors in quantities depended on full 

one-port  vector  network  analyser  (VNA)  measurements  using  differentials  and  a 

complex  differential  error  region  (DER)  was  defined.  To  evaluate  the  method, 

differences instead of differentials were placed over a DER which was then analysed 

and  compared  with  another  commonly  used  estimated  error.  Two  real  differential 

error intervals (DEIs) were defined by the greatest lower and least upper bounds of 

DER projections. To demonstrate the method, a typical device under test (DUT) was 

built and tested against frequency. Practically, a DER and its DEIs are solely based 

on  manufacturer's  data  for  standard  loads  and  their  uncertainties,  measured  values 

and their inaccuracies. 

Introduction:  In  full  one-port  measurements  with  a  VNA  of  real  characteristic 

impedance Z0, a DUT with impedance Z has a reflection coefficient ρ defined by 

and related to its measured value m by the bilinear transformation 

ρ = (Z - Z0)/(Z + Z0) 

ρ = (m - D)/[M(m - D) + R] 

in  terms  of  errors  D,  M  and  R  [1].  This  transformation  can  be  uniquely  determined 

from given distinct ρn, n = 1, 2, 3 and respectively known mk, k = n [2].

Theory:  We  considered  ρn,  mk  as  the  elements  of  given  ordered  triples  (A,B,C), 

(a,b,c), solved the resulting system and appropriately expressed its solution by  

F = ∑ cC(B - A) 

D = ∑ abC(A - B)/F 

M = ∑ c(B - A)/F 

R = [∏ (A - B)(a - b)]/F2 

where  ∑  and  ∏  produce  two  more  terms  from  the  one  shown,  by  rotation  of  the 

ordered  triple  elements.  These  errors  were  then  considered  as  depended  on  the 

independent  variables  ρn,  mk.  Therefore,  their  differentials  were  expressed  in  the 

same manner by 

dD = [∏ (a-b) ∑ (B - C)BCdA + ∑ (b - c)2(B - A)(C - A)BCda]/F2 

dM = [∑ (a - b)(c - a)(B - C)2dA - ∏ (A - B) ∑ (b - c)da]/F2 

dR = {∑ [F + 2(a - b)B(A - C)][(B - C)2dA ∏ (a - b) - (b - c)2da ∏ (A - B)]}/F3 

After that, the differential of ρ was expressed by  

dρ = [-RdD - (m - D)2dM - (m - D)dR + Rdm]/[M(m - D) + R]2 

and  was  considered  depended,  through  dD,  dM  and  dR,  on  L  =  7  independent 

variables and their independent differentials: ρn, n = 1, 2, 3 and mk, k = n or k = 0 with 

m0 = m.  

program for symbolic computations. 

The  developed  expressions  were  mechanically  verified  using  a  developed  software 

Application:  Manufacturer's  data  for  standard  loads  used  in  full-one  port  VNA 

measurements  are  substituted  in  ρn,  and  for  their  uncertainties  in  dρn.  Since  Z0  is 

real, the domain of each ρn is the closed unit circle [3]. For |ρn| = 0 or 1, care must be

exercised  to  restrict  its  differential  value  onto  its  domain.  The  VNA  measurements 

have specified bounded ranges for their modulus and argument, so that the domain 

of each mk is a bounded circular annular with its centre at the origin Ο of the complex 

plane.  Measurement  data  are  substituted  in  mk  and  manufacturer's  data  for 

measurement  inaccuracy  in  dmk.  Uncertainty  and  inaccuracy  data  outline  domains 

If z = |r|ejϕ, stands for any of the independent variables and dz for its differential then 

the contribution of dz to dρ is a summation term of the form Wdz, with W = |U|ejV, so 

for dρn and dmk.  

that  

Wdz = |U|ej(V + ϕ)d|r| + |U|ej(V + ϕ + π/2)|r|dϕ 

where W is in fact a known value of the respective partial derivative and d|r|, dϕ are 

the  independent  real  differentials  of  the  complex  dz  in  polar  form.  Each  expression 

Wdz  outlines  a  contour  for  a  partial  DER  around  Ο.  If  z  ≠  0,  the  partial  DER  is  a 

parallelogram  with  perpendicular  sides  d|r|  and  |r|dϕ,  stretched  or  contracted  by  |U| 

and rotated by (V + ϕ) around Ο. If z = ρn = 0, the partial DER is a circle with radius 

|U|d|r|.  Accordingly,  a  DER  is  the  sum  of  either  L  parallelograms  or  (L  -  1) 

parallelograms and 1 circle. DER is then a convex set with contour either a polygonal 

line  with  4L  vertices  at  most,  or  a  piecewise  curve  composed  of  4(L  -  1)  line 

segments  and  4(L  -  1)  circular  arcs  at  most.  The  greatest  lower  and  least  upper 

differential error bounds are the end-points of DEIs for the real and imaginary parts of 

dρ and result from the projections of DER for ρ on the coordinate axes.  

These  conclusions  can  be  generalized  for  any  other  quantity  directly  or  indirectly 

depended  on  all,  some  or  just  one  of  the  above  independent  variables  and  their

differentials.  Thus,  the  quantity  has  an  L-term  DER,  where  7  ≥  L  ≥  1.  For  example, 

the impedance Z of a DUT has the 7-term DER:  

dZ = 2Z0dρ/(1 - ρ)2 

 

 

Results: All of the following data are specified by manufacturers of the parts for our 

measurement  system.  This  system  operates  from  1  to  1300  MHz  with  100  Hz  PLL 

stability  and  consists  of  a  type-N  Z0  =  50  Ω  network  analyser,  a  number  of  support 

instruments and a set of standard loads.  

The  standards  are:  a  short  circuit  A,  a  matching  load  B  with  reflection  coefficient 

0.029 and an open circuit C with reflection coefficient 0.99 and phase accuracy ±2°. 

In  the  absence  of  manufacturer's  data  for  A  we  considered  its  uncertainty  equal  to 

that of C. So, the following values were substituted in the developed expressions: A = 

−1, 0 ≤ d|A| ≤ 0.01, −180° ≤ dϕA ≤ −178° or 178° ≤ dϕA ≤ 180°, B = 0, |dB| = 0.029, C 

= 1, −0.01 ≤ d|C| ≤ 0, −2° ≤ dϕC ≤ +2°. The annular domain for mk of VNA is specified 

from 0 to -70 db in modulus and ±180 degrees in argument. Measurements mk result 

with a decimal floating point precision of 4 digits, for both modulus and argument. We 

consider the modulus and argument of dmk equal to ±1/2 of the unit in the last place 

of  the  corresponding  mantissa  in  modulus  and  argument  of  mk.  Consequently,  our 

system produces a DER, either for ρ or Z, as a sum of (L -1) = 6 parallelograms and 

1 circle, with a contour of (4L + 4L) = 48 vertices at most.  

A  suite  of  developed  software  applications:  (i)  controls  the  system  and  collects  the 

data in terms of frequency using the IEEE-488 protocol, (ii) processes the collected 

data and computes the vertices of DER and the end-points of its DEIs (iii) sketches 

pictures of DER for ρ and its counterpart Z in terms of the frequency steps and make 

a film using them as frames.

A  typical  resistor  with  a  nominal  DC  impedance  of  50  Ω  ±20%  tolerance  was 

soldered on a type-N base connector and enclosed in an aluminium box to serve as 

a  simple  DUT  for  testing  its  Z  from  2  to  1289  MHz  in  13  MHz  steps.  The  centre 

frequency fC = 639 MHz was chosen to reveal the details of the proposed method in 

Fig.  1,  where  the  contour  of  a  typical  DER  for  Z  is  outlined  with  small  circles  as  its 

vertices.

This contour surrounds that of the 4-terms DER due to inaccuracy of measurements 

(1) and that of 3-terms DER for the uncertainty of loads (2). A properly circumscribed 

rectangle of DER shows graphically how the DEIs for R and X result. The commonly 

used error from the matching load only is shown as a dotted circle. This is in fact a 1-

term  DER  which  is  surrounded  from  the  contour  of  the  DER  by  a  factor  of  about 

125%  to  185%  in  all  directions.  Finally,  in  the  same  figure,  27x2  differences  ∆Z 

resulting  from  the  same  dρn  and  dmk,  dense  enough  to  appear  as  stripes,  were 

placed over DER to compare them with differential dZ values. Notably, almost all of 

∆Z values are belong to DER while the computation time for these ∆Z exceeds that 

for DER by more than one order of magnitude.

Fig. 2, as beads on space curved filaments against frequency.

estimate  errors  in  any  quantity  depended  on  full  one-port  vector  network  analyser

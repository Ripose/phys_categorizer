Abstract. - We connect the classical free damping cases by means of Ros-
ner’s construction in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Starting with the
critical damping, one can obtain in the underdamping case a chirping of instan-
usech2(ωut), whereas in the overdamped
taneous physical frequency ω2(t) ∝ ω2
case the “chirping” is of the (unphysical) type ω2(t) ∝ ω2
osec2(ωot), where ωu
and ωo are the underdamped and overdamped frequency parameters, respec-
tively.

The techniques of supersymmetric quantum mechanics gave a new impetus
to many research areas in the last two decades [1]. In this note, we start with the
critical free damping case in classical mechanics and construct the corresponding
supersymmetric partners. The free damping Newton equation reads

Using the gauge change of dependent variable x = y exp(− γ
can be put in the following Schr¨odinger form in the time domain

d = (γ/2m)2 − k/m. Thus, one can discuss separately,

the classical cases of underdamping (oscillating relaxation), critical damping
(rapid nonoscillating relaxation), and overdamping (slow nonoscillating relax-
ation), i.e., −ω2
c = ω2
d < 0, ω2
o = ω2
d > 0, respectively
[2]. Notice that the physical ω2
d frequencies are negative, the positive ones are
only convenient mathematical symbols corresponding in fact to nonoscillating
regimes.

u = ω2

We now proceed with the supersymmetric scheme that we apply in a manner
similar to Rosner [3]. Thus, we start with the case of critical damping corre-
sponding in quantum mechanics to a potential which is zero and relate it to
a Schr¨odinger-type equation in the time domain which has a fundamental fre-
quency at ω2
u, i.e., a single oscillating relaxation mode that we consider as the
equivalent of a bound state in the usual quantum mechanics. In other words,
we solve the “fermionic” Riccati equation

with the localized solution ˜y ∝ ωusech(ωut). The physical picture is that of
a chirping sech soliton proﬁle containing a single oscillating relaxation mode

recursively to get several oscillating relaxation modes embedded in the chirping
Indeed, suppose we would like to introduce N oscillating

where an = N − n, onto the “ground state” underdamped mode. This
scheme can be easily generalized to embedding frequencies of the type −ω2
u,i =
(γi/2m)2 − k/m and moreover, to the construction of chirp proﬁles having a
given continuous spectrum of relaxational modes but we shall not pursue this
task here.

On the other hand, in the case of overdamping the “fermionic” Riccati equa-

tion

leads to the solution W1 = ωotan(ωot) and from the “bosonic” Riccati equation

has solutions of the type ˜y ∝ ωosec(ωot), and therefore the approach leads to
unphysical results.

Referring again to the underdamped case, we also remark that an interesting
analysis of the chirp frequency proﬁle can be performed by means of the change
of variable t = ln(tan θ

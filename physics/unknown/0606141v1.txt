Field Emission in CEBAF's Superconducting RF Cavities and Implications for Future Accelerators

Field emission is one of the key issues in superconducting RF for particle accelerators.1  

Abstract 
 
 
When present, it limits operating gradient directly or via induced heat load at 2K.  In order to 
minimize particulate contamination of and thus field emission in the CEBAF SRF cavities during 
assembly, a cold ceramic RF window was placed very close to the accelerating cavity proper.  As 
an unintended consequence of this, the window is charged by field-emitted electrons, making it 
possible to monitor and model field emission in the CEBAF cavities since in-tunnel operation 
began.  From January 30, 1995, through February 10, 2003, there were 64 instances of 
spontaneous onset or change in cavity field emission with a drop in usable gradient averaging 1.4 
(σ 0.8) MV/m at each event.  Fractional loss averaged 0.18 (σ 0.12) of pre-event gradient.  This 
event count corresponds to 2.4 events per century per cavity, or 8 per year in CEBAF.  It is 
hypothesized that changes in field emission are due to adsorbed gas accumulation.  The possible 
implications of this and other observations for the International Linear Collider (ILC) and other 
future accelerators will be discussed.  
 
Monitoring Field Emission in CEBAF 
 
 
The CEBAF 5-cell cavity pair and helium vessel are shown schematically in figure 1.  
The features of interest for this work are the high resistance (> 1012 ohms/square) cold ceramic 
RF window 7.62 cm from the beam axis, a fundamental power coupler (FPC) with significant 
magnetic dipole field, and sensors attached to the waveguide at room temperature.  The FPC 
induces a transverse kick of ~20 milliradians–MeV/c when the electron is on-crest in the 
adjacent accelerating cell, 147o RF phase away, and the cavity gradient as a whole is set at 7 
MV/m.2  While only modest trajectory modeling has been done3, it is clear conceptually and has 
been demonstrated in vertical test dewar experiments that field emitted electrons from either 
cavity in a pair can reach and accumulate on the cold ceramic window.4,5  The same set of 
vertical dewar experiments demonstrated that the interposing of an elbow or dogleg waveguide 
between the fundamental power (input) coupler flange and the ceramic window dropped the 
electron current to the window by three orders of magnitude.   
 
During CEBAF commissioning, arc discharges were seen at the cold ceramic windows 
via photomultipliers and vacuum sensors attached to the warm-to-cold transition waveguide.  
These were verified with spectroscopic observation in vertical dewar tests6 to occur at the 
ceramic and may be either surface flashover or punch-through.  The latter is demonstrated by 
leak testing – most of the cold ceramic window assemblies in the accelerator now have small 
holes.  In vertical tests, with a picoammeter available to monitor field emission current to the 
window, the discharges occurred at roughly constant window charge.5  There is no way to 
monitor field emission current directly in the accelerator as all the vacuum seals are metal and 
there is no access to the cold ceramic window.  All that can be recorded is the occurrence of arc 
and vacuum faults and the gradient in the cavity at the time each fault occurred.  Such records 
have been maintained since Jan. 30, 1995.  The data set contains 427,400 RF faults through May 
30, 2005.   
My analysis assumes that the cold ceramic window is a perfect capacitor and that the 
 
charge at which a discharge occurs is constant.  The interval between discharges is then inversely 
proportional to a constant field emission current.  If the gradient setting is constant in the interval 

and RF is on throughout, one can easily apply a simple exponential or more rigorous Fowler-
Nordheim1 model to the data directly to obtain a field emission model for each cavity.

The data is not perfectly clean so one pre-processing step and five data cuts are applied 
before statistical analysis.  Until November 2004, there was no recordable signal giving RF-on 
time for each cavity.  The pre-processing step approximates RF-on status by removing periods of 
6+ hours in which no fault occurs anywhere in the machine from a running total of elapsed 
seconds.  This assumes that all cavities are turned on and off at the same time, which is not the 
case – occasionally one linac is on and the other off for maintenance.  This increases the noise in 
the data.  The five cuts in the data and their justification are:  
 
a.   exclusion from analysis of faults with gradient under 3 MV/m due to limitations in RF 

control system stability which decrease fault interval for low gradients 

b.   exclusion from analysis of faults with intervals under 30 seconds due to variation in reset 

time from 7-30 seconds; reset was manual during most of the data collection 

c.  exclusion from analysis of faults with intervals more than 12 days (1036800 s) due to data 
plots suggesting that the assumption of perfect capacitors begins to break down at this 
interval.  Data analyzed thus spans 4.5 orders of magnitude in interval.   

d.   exclusion from analysis of faults in which the gradient change from the preceding fault is 
more than 15%.  There would be insufficient data to analyze if the assumption that the 
gradient is constant across the full interval were rigorously enforced.  Both 10% and 15% 
cuts have been used with little difference in results.  Since the gradient enters in the first 
power in the exponent in the simple exponential model and as the 5/2 power in the exponent 
in the Fowler-Nordheim model, no larger allowances were tested.   

e.  exclusion of simultaneous (within timing resolution) faults of cavities in multiple helium 

vessels as due to beam strike or control system effects rather than field emission.   

 
 
Photomultiplier (PMT) and vacuum sensors were mentioned above.  The first is termed 
the arc detector and is a simple threshold detector – if a PMT signal greater than a fixed level is 
detected for more than 0.5 ms, the RF is shut off and a fault bit set.  The second is connected to a 
pair of cavities and the actual pressure archived as a function of time.  About 20% of the 

About 5% of the faults show only an arc detector bit.  In early 2003 the archiving rate for 

accumulated RF faults show only vacuum faults and cannot be assigned to a single cavity, only 
to a pair.  Inclusion of these faults in the analysis of either member of the pair has always 
decreased correlation coefficients, so these faults are discarded.  Some fraction of these are likely 
accompanied by sub-threshold PMT signals and should be included but there is no way to 
determine which.  About 75% of the faults show simultaneous arc and vacuum faults.   
 
the vacuum data was increased from 1 to 10 Hz.  This allowed the addition of a data pre-
processing step which determines if there was a sub-threshold vacuum event at the same time as 
the arc detector fault and reclassifies about half of these 5% as true arcs.  An increase in vacuum 
reading at least equal to background is required for the reclassification.  When plotted, all such 
vacuum traces show classic burst and recovery patterns.  For the data set ending in February 
2003, the author determined by visual inspection in the data exploration program JMP7 which of 
the arc-detector-only faults would be included in the analysis.   
 
makes the cuts described above to this subset, ending with ~71% of the total faults.  Known 
noise sources include, as discussed above: imprecision in RF-on intervals, changes in gradient 
during intervals, variation in window charge at discharge, and nonassignable vacuum-only faults.   
 
cavity 0L031. This is the first cavity in CEBAF which varies in gradient; the two preceding 
cavities take the beam from 0.5 MeV to 5 MeV and are invariant.  Only seven points were 
removed by the data cuts discussed above.  Residuals of the fit are shown in figure 3 left.  The 
distribution is close to normal visually but does not satisfy the Shapiro-Wilk W test for 
normality14.  Removing two outliers from the high side and eight from the low, followed by 
refitting, results in the residual distribution in figure 3 right, which is consistent with normality.   

Figure 2 is a plot of the ln of the inverse fault intervals as a function of cavity gradient for 

The analysis which follows therefore begins with about 77% of the faults recorded and

This labor-intensive process of exploration of the data sets for outliers and development 
of exponential and Fowler-Nordheim models for each of 338 CEBAF cavities has been repeated 
many times since the beginning of 1995.  The exponential models are used in a program which 
sets the gradient distribution along the linacs to minimize arc rate.8  The Fowler-Nordheim 
models were used through August 2003 during outlier removal as residuals tended to be closer to 
normal (Shapiro-Wilk W test).  After the hurricane-induced temperature cycle to room 

temperature in August 20039, such niceties were abandoned due to lack of time and only the 
exponential models were developed since those are the only ones used in machine setup.

emission and therefore mandate new statistical models are 30K warm-up, 300K warm-up 
and 
helium RF-discharge processing10.  All of these will change adsorbed gas distribution, the lead
 
hypothesis for the phenomenon discussed below.  Inaccurately calibrated RF control hardware 
can also cause a change in apparent response as the gradient scale changes.   
Sixty-four events with no external drivers were found with this distinc

ng at least a factor of three change in fault interval at fixed gradient, in the data set 
encompassing Jan. 30, 1995, through February 10, 2003, all but one degradations.  Most of
 the 
changes in interval were at least an order of magnitude.  Some were associated with a period of 
RF-off for magnet or other maintenance in the tunnel, but no recorded maintenance of any sort 
on the cavity or RF system in question.  Figure 5 is one such change.  This count of 64 is the 
minimum for the period and corresponds to 2.4 per cavity-century, or eight per year in CEBA
F 
with 338 cavities.  For an ILC with 20,000 cavities, the toll might be 500/year if the phenomeno
n 
occurs.  Without similar long term performance data from TTF or other high performing cavities, 
it is not known whether the ~ 2.5 MV/m loss at fixed fault interval seen in figure 4 is best viewed 
as an offset or fractional loss of previous behavior.  The former is much preferred for ILC.   
 
The cavity performance changes are not subtle, providing confidence that the 64 even
ts 
selected are the minimum set.  Maximum set would include perhaps half again this number.  In 
figure 6 the distributions of absolute and fractional gradient loss for the 64 events are shown.  
Mean gradient loss is 1.4 (σ 0.8) MV/m and mean fractional loss 0.18 (σ 0.11).  It is not clear 
whether  the improvement in one cavity is real or a result of measurement error induced by 
unrecorded maintenance.  Its inclusion renders the left distribution more consistent with 

normality.  If excluded, losses are 1.4 (σ 0.7) MV/m and 0.18 (σ 0.10) fractional for the 6
sets.

arcs, it is possible for an adjacent cavity to do so as well.  Such "fratricide" may extend beyond  
the other member of a cavity pair to adjacent helium vessels.  Fratricide is found and quantified 
by stepwise regression of multiple cavity gradients in JMP7.  The check for fratricide is one of 
the reasons for the large amount of human input to the analysis.  A tenth show such influence. 
The author was convinced of the phenomenon's existence by the abrupt changes in the 
 
performance of cavities 6 and 7 in zone NL04 when an accidental introduction of N2 into cavity 
8 forced its gradient to drop from 10 MV/m to 5 MV/m.  Retrospective analysis of previously 
misunderstood data showed that when cavity 8 was below 7.5 MV/m, fault vs gradient behavior 
in cavities 6 and 7 was consistent with field emission models.  Figure 7 shows the data for cavity 
6.  Cavity 7 faulted so infrequently after cavity 8 was turned down that insufficient data is 
available for analysis.  The physical mechanism of interaction between cavities which are not in 
the same pair is unknown.  When fratricide is statistically found in cavity response and the 
culprit is located, a maximum culprit gradient is estimated and tested in the machine.  Thirty-two 
models now in use are modified by fratricide.

Characteristics of the set of models now in use 
 
The ensemble of statistical models which were used in the operation of CEBAF8 in early 
 
2005 will now be characterized statistically.  Perhaps the most striking feature is an exceptional 
correlation of the slope and intercept of the exponential models (figure 8).  The physical source
 
of this correlation is unknown.  It may be a function of cavity and FPC geometry.

cavities in which such points are more than 10% of the total is kept for manual check in JMP so 
abrupt changes as in figures 4 and 5 are not ignored.  Four fitting routines from the open source 
statistics environment R11 are then applied via an R script: standard least squares and three robust 
regression algorithms, M-estimator, MM-estimator and least trimmed squares.  Nume
rical output 
is directed to a summary file and a graph of the data and the four fits is produced as a postscript

cryomodule perturbations force a change.  The graph for 0L031 is shown in figure 10.

Implications for Future Accelerators 
 
 
increase in geometrical electric field enhancement by “one more” gas molecule adsorbing to an 
asperity on the cavity surface.  This mechanism should be independent of duty cycle, depending 
only on vacuum conditions.  Leak rate of CEBAF cavity pairs was measured during superfluid 
helium vertical dewar tests via an integration method and average 4x10-11 std cc/s 12.  The fact 
that CEBAF runs CW with RF on ~75% of the year and the ILC will run pulsed with ~1% duty 
cycle should be irrelevant for emission turn-on rate in this hypothesis.  Particle migration is th
e 
other hypothesis remaining.  Emitter turn-on has no correlation with cavity location within a 
ryomodule, but this result is not strong statistically with so few data.  There are open gate 
c
v
alves with Viton gate seals at each end of each cavity pair and four ceramic HOM loads (figure 
1
) on each pair which might be sources of particles.  The low correlation between pre and post 
ends credence to the gas adsorbtion hypothesis because 
hurricane gradients shown in figure 12 l
eam line vacuum remained in the molecular flow regime even at 300K, reducing the likelihood 
b
of particle motion.  There's a significant difference here between CEBAF and future accelera
CEBAF runs with ~600W of 2K heating due to field emission at 5.8 GeV, or ~2.5W per 
 
cavity with field emission model.  In vertical dewar tests, the author was able to run with up to 
70W of field emission heating without quenching the cavity.  Maximum field emission he
allowable by the TESLA cryomodule design is not known to the author, but ~10W extra in one 
cavity probably won’t choke the plumbing.   
 
Improved surface preparation of the ILC cavities, including electropolishing, will reduce 
the asperity count per unit area orders of magnitude over that achieved in 1991–1993 in CEBAF.
In the best case for ILC, this will cut the rate of abrupt changes to a level that is irrelevant for 
machine operation.  If the 1995–2003 CEBAF rate holds in spite of this, undetected events co
uld 
add up to 5 kW 2K heat load per year in ILC, but for a 1% duty cycle machine the increase in
 
energy deposited to 2K is likely negligible.  The heat load from new field emitters wou

important for a future CW machine, for example ERL (energy recovered linac) based FELs or 
light sources, despite the fact that the number of cavities involved in any of these applications

cannot say which rate, if either, is appropriate for use in planning ILC.  Long term

function of gradient was needed.  The x-rays from some cavities didn’t intercept th

Jefferson Lab is beginning a modest program to refurbish cryomodules.  Improved 
surface preparation techniques will be applied with the goal of achieving at least 30 MV/m 
surface field (12 MV/m accelerating gradient) in refurbished cavities.  The installed ensemble 
averaged 13 MV/m accelerating gradient with field emission in vertical test in 1991–1993.  T
he 
best vertical test result was 21 MV/m, so 40 MV/m surface field average is not unrealistic a

emission in one cryomodule so equipped and so will eliminate the method for monitoring field

emission in the absence of charge/discharge cycles on the cold ceramic windows.  A more 
ambitious refurbishment program might apply two to four surface preparation techniques of 
varying complexity and cost to twenty to ten cryomodules each.  Three years of observation 
would then produce statistically significant re
longevity (against spontaneous field emission changes) of each treatment.  Such information 
would be valuable for the ILC and other future accelerators.

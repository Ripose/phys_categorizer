Abstract

We  report  theory,  measurements  and  numerical  simulations  on  nonlinear  piezoelectric

ultrasonic devices with stable limit cycles.  The devices are shown to exhibit behavior familiar from

the theory of coupled auto-oscillators.  Frequency of auto-oscillation is affected by the presence of

an acoustic cavity as these spontaneously emitting devices adjust their frequency to the spectrum of

the  acoustic  cavity.   Also,  the  auto-oscillation  is  shown  to  be  entrained  by  an  applied  field;  the

oscillator synchronizes to an incident wave at a frequency close to the natural frequency of the limit

cycle.    It is further shown that synchronization occurs here with a phase that can, depending on

details, correspond to stimulated emission: the power emission from the oscillator is augmented by

the  incident  field.   These  behaviors  are  essential  to  eventual  design  of  an  ultrasonic  system  that

would consist of a number of such devices entrained to their mutual field, a system that would be an

analog to a laser.   A prototype uaser is constructed.

I.  Introduction

Laser  oscillation  is  not  necessarily  a  quantum  phenomenon.   Classical  laser  designs[1-6]

have pedagogic value but no devices have yet been constructed, and the designs have played no role

in laser research.    Here we report construction of nonlinear classical oscillators in contact with an

acoustic  cavity  and  capable  of  both  spontaneous  and  stimulated  emission.   We  believe  systems

consisting of such oscillators will have both pedagogic and research value.   Because acoustic waves

with  their  longer  wavelengths  and  longer  time  scales  permit  probes  and  controls  to  a  degree  not

possible in optics, these systems should permit detailed experiments that complement those possible

with lasers.

The sine-qua-non of a laser is stimulated emission, in which a wave incident upon an excited

oscillator is re-emitted with unchanged phase and increased amplitude.    It is perhaps not widely

appreciated  that  stimulated  emission  is  a  classical  phenomenon[1-6].   An  excited  classical  linear

oscillator will exhibit stimulated absorption or stimulated emission depending on the phase of the

oscillator relative to that of the incident field.  Thus an incoherent mixture of excited classical linear

oscillators will show no net stimulated emission.   If, however, all or most of the oscillators can be

induced to have the same frequency and the correct phases, the set will exhibit stimulated emission.

Such systems may be termed laser analogs [7,8].

The classical laser designs of Borenstein and Lamb [1,2] and Kobelov et al[4], are composed

of  incoherently  excited  Duffing  oscillators  (i.e.,  stiffness  having  a  cubic  nonlinearity).   The

oscillators emit spontaneously in a trivial fashion.   When they go into resonance with each other

with the right phase relation, under the influence of their mutual radiation field, they also emit by

stimulated emission.  These designs are pedagogically stimulating.  No attempt has yet been made to

build them.

Zavtrak[5,6] has suggested that bubbles or other particles in a fluid could be pumped by an

applied coherent harmonic electric or acoustic field.    He suggests that the particles would bunch

spatially under the influence of their radiation forces, leading to a coherent re-emission in a direction

imposed by their radiation field and the modes of their cavity.    This analog to a free–electron laser

has not been constructed either.

Recent years have seen considerable interest in dynamic synchronization [9-13] in which sets

of  simple  distinct  coupled  auto-oscillating  limit  cycles  routinely  synchronize.   The  phenomenon

occurs in disparate circumstances, including firefly flashes, brain waves, esophagal waves, bridges

with crowds of pedestrians, and chemical oscillations.  It occurs amongst lasers, Josephson junctions

and  pendulum  clocks.   The  chief mathematical  model  for  studying  the  synchronization  of  large

numbers of auto-oscillators is that of Kuramoto, and its generalizations[7-10].     After arguing that

the state of a limit cycle oscillator is well represented in terms of its phase ξ, and that the phase of

each  of  the  oscillators  is  weakly  coupled  to  the  phases  of  the  others[14],  one  derives  a  set  of  N

coupled first order ordinary differential equations:[ 9-12]

dξn/dt = ωn + (A/N)  Σm sin(ξm - ξn).

It has been shown that this model, in the thermodynamic limit N∞, exhibits a phase transition in

which a macroscopic number of oscillators lock to one and other.   Sundry generalizations have been

discussed, such as time delays and randomness in the couplings.   Resemblance between this phase

transition and the onset of coherence amongst the atoms of a laser has been noted[8].

In seeking a classical wave analog to a laser we recognize the necessity for the fixing of local

oscillators to a common frequency, and thus their coherence.  Synchronization of auto-oscillators is

3

one way in which this can be done.  But it is also necessary that these oscillators lock to the mutual

field  with  phases  that  correspond  to  stimulated  emission  rather  than  absorption.    As  discussed

elsewhere[1,2], a random phase in an oscillator, even if it has the same frequency as an incident

field, will lead to no particular stimulated emission.   Only to the extent that the oscillator and the

incident  field  have  the  correct  phase  relation  will  the  energy  in  the  oscillator  be  transferred

efficiently to the wave field.    For an excited atom in an electromagnetic field, this phase relation is

automatically satisfied.    A classical linear oscillator on a mechanical body applies a force with no

particular phase relation to an incident field.   Nonetheless dynamic synchronization studies[9-13]

show that nonlinear classical auto-oscillators can be entrained by their mutual radiation or by an

applied field.  They tend to synchronize to a common frequency with fixed phase relation.    If that

phase relation is such that each oscillator emits at a rate greater than it does without an incident field,

there is stimulated emission and the system will be a laser analog. [7]

Here  we  present  an  electro-mechanical  auto-oscillator  that  could  be  an  element  in  an

ultrasonic laser analog. When placed on an acoustic cavity the oscillator exhibits both spontaneous

and  stimulated  emission.    It  is  pictured  in  figure  1.    A  piezoelectric transducer  is  attached  to  a

regular  or  irregular  elastic  body  at  arbitrary  position.   Like  most  ultrasonic  transducers  it  is

reciprocal; it both radiates and receives ultrasound.   It has electronic impedance that is nominally

capacitive  with  additional  small  contributions  from  the  mechanics.   Our  transducer  is  part  of  a

nonlinear electronic circuit with a limit cycle at a frequency and amplitude that depends on circuit

parameters.  A second transducer at y monitors the acoustic state of the elastic body.     An optional

third transducer at z is driven by a continuous wave at a prescribed frequency and amplitude.

In  the  next  section  we  propose  an  analytic  model  and  predict  the  frequency  and  rate  of

emission  at  x  in  the  absence  of  the  source  at  z.   We also  predict circumstances, with  arguments

4

similar to those of [9-14], under which the oscillator at x will entrain to an applied field from z.  We

further describe circumstances under which that entrainment to an applied field corresponds, not just

to synchronization, but also to stimulated emission.   Later sections present results from numerical

simulations and observations from experiments.  Finally, it is demonstrated that two or three of our

piezoelectric auto-oscillators, when entrained to their mutual ultrasonic field as in [9-14], do with

stimulated emission and exhibit super radiance.

Figure 1.   A reverberant acoustic cavity (elastodynamic body), large compared to a wavelength, is

driven at position x by a piezoelectric transducer that is part of a circuit with an attracting limit-cycle.

The acoustic state of the cavity is monitored by a separate receiver at y.    An optional third transducer

at z is driven by an applied harmonic signal at prescribed frequency and amplitude.

II.   Entrainment and stimulated emission of piezoelectric auto-oscillators, theory

Here  we  study  the  behavior  of  a  linear  piezoelectric  device  that  is  part  of  a  van-der  Pol

electronic  oscillator  [15]  and  which  is  in  contact  with  an  acoustic  cavity.    We  posit  that  the

transducer is a standard linear two-port network [16], with potential drop v and charge q on one port,

and mechanical force f and mechanical displacement u on the other.   These inputs and outputs are

related by a matrix.

where D = T11T22-T12T21.    T11 may be interpreted as the inverse of the piezoelectric's capacitance

when clamped (u=0).  T22/D may be interpreted as the capacitance C of the device when there is no

€ 

force  on  it  (f=0).      T22  is  the  shortcircuited  mechanical  stiffness  of  the  device.    Reciprocity

demands T12 = T21.  All coefficients are in general complex functions of frequency; T*(ω) = T(-ω).

with [T(ω)] = ∫ exp(-iωt)[T(t)] dt = [T(ω)]T.    A passive transducer must have P ≥ 0.    We therefore

conclude that [T(ω)]'s imaginary part must be positive (negative) semi-definite at positive (negative)

frequency.

Figure 2] Diagram for a piezoelectric auto oscillator.   The current I into the device depends on the

potential across the negistor in a nonlinear fashion I(Vc-v) where the function I is characteristic of

the negistor.  The static supply voltage V is adjusted so that, at static equilibrium, v=0 and dI/dV is

negative and maximal.   At this point current varies with v like g(v) v, -g(0) being the slope of I(V) at

this  point.   We  take  g  in  the  form  g  =  ε C  (1-βv2)  with ε >  0.  Further  details  of  the negistor are

described in section IV.

Differentiating (2) with respect to time, and substituting for d2q/dt2 by (1b) gives:

d 2v /dt 2 −ε(1− 3βv2) dv /dt + (LC)−1v = (T12 /T22) d 2 f / dt 2

   

     (3)

This  form  is  useful  when  the  force  is  prescribed.    In  particular  if  f  =  0,  corresponding  to  the

transducer being mechanically free, (3) becomes a van der Pol equation[15,17].

€ 

Equation (1b) implies a relation between f u and v:

(4)

f = T21 /T11 v + D /T11 u

So, if u is prescribed there is an alternate form:

IIB  Spontaneous emission

€ 

Equations (3,4,5) are not complete unless we specify u or f, or a relation between them.    A

case  of  primary  interest  is  that  of  free  radiation  into  an  otherwise  passive  acoustic  medium,  for

which:  u = - Gf.   (The minus sign arises from the opposite orientation of f and u with respect to the

acoustic medium, see figure 2).  Here G is Gxx, a diagonal element of Greens' function of the acoustic

cavity at position x.   Thus, from (4)

[1+ DG /T11] f = T21 /T11 v

and

d 2v /dt 2 −ε(1− 3βv2) dv /dt +[(LC)−1 − {T12T21 /T22(T11 + DG)} d 2 / dt 2 ]v = 0
€ 

€ 

Nonlinear dynamical equations such as (7) are challenging.  This is especially so if the complicated

time-delays and temporal convolutions in T and G are fully expressed.    For the present purposes

we will presume that G may be evaluated at the frequency of chief interest, that G is only weakly

dependent on frequency and can be replaced by a constant.   The elements of [T] also vary with

frequency  but  generally  in  a  much  smoother  fashion,  so  replacing  them  by  constants  is  readily

justified.   Rewriting (7) as a phase oscillator simplifies it [ 14, 7-12 ].  One assumes the oscillator

stays on or near its limit cycle, at a frequency Ω, with a slowly varying real amplitude and phase V

v = V (t)exp(iΩt + iξ(t)) + c.c.

(8)

and ξ:

€ 

8

On assuming dV/dt <<  ΩV; dξ/dt << Ω, and | ω−Ω | << Ω we derive

[2iΩ dV / dt − Ω2V +ω2V − 2VΩdξ/ dt − iεΩ(1− 6βV 2 )V + iµV ]exp(iΩt + iξ(t)) = 0  (9)

where ω2  is the real part of [ (LC)–1+ { T12 T21 Ω2 / T22 [ T11+ DG] } ] and µ is the imaginary part.

€ 

 

The real and imaginary parts of eqn 9 are:

dV / dt − (1/ 2)ε(1− 6βV 2 )V + (1/ 2Ω)µV = 0

and

€ 

€ 

dξ/dt = (ω2 − Ω2 ) /2Ω ≈ (ω− Ω)

A steady solution implies Ω = ω, and   V = [(εΩ-µ)/6εΩβ]1/2.    ( If εΩ< µ, the van der Pol oscillator

loses its limit cycle and V = 0. )

When the device is unattached to the acoustic cavity, as enforced mathematically by taking f

=  0,  equivalently  G  =  ∞,  the  frequency  of  the  auto  oscillation  is  the  real  part  of  (LC)-1/2.    The

frequency is changed by the acoustic cavity to a value ω that is a solution of the implicit equation ω2

= Re [ (LC(ω))–1+ { T12(ω)T21(ω) ω2 / T22 [ T11(ω)+ D(ω)G(ω)] } ]1/2

.   In a reverberant cavity G can

be an irregular function of ω, so solutions may be complicated, or multiple.

The power radiated from the device into the mechanical medium is  

Π = - f x du/dt = f x dG/dt  f   

which is, by 6,

  Π = [ 1 + D G/T11 ]-1 T21/T11 v   x   dG/dt   [ 1 + D G/T11 ]-1 T21/T11 v

  = -2 Ω Im G(Ω)  | T11+ D G |-2 | T21 |2  V2      

  = -2 Ω Im G(Ω)| T11+  D G |-2 | T21 |2 [(εΩ-µ)/6εΩβ]

The first equality in (13) arises from a time averaging.  ( If εΩ< µ, Π = 0. )  This is the power of the

spontaneous emission.

IIC Entrainment and Stimulated emission

An  incident  wave  field  uinc  in  the  acoustic  medium  can  modify  the  state  of  the  nonlinear

oscillator and increase or decrease its emitted power.   The oscillator augments the field with its own

radiation –Gf, so u = uinc - Gf .  The equation governing the oscillator is still (3), but now with

f = T21/T11 v + D/T11 [uinc - Gf ]

 

(14)

d 2v /dt 2 −ε(1− 3βv2) dv /dt +[(LC)−1 − {T12T21 /T22(T11 + DG)} d 2 / dt 2 ]v

(15)

= (DT12 /T22(T11 + DG)) d 2uinc /dt 2

This is identical to (7), but now with a term from the incident field that influences the auto-oscillator.

€ 

This is a van-der Pol oscillator with harmonic forcing.  That such oscillators can be entrained to the

frequency of the forcing is well known[2,9-14].   We take the incident field at x,  uinc   to be of the

form  U  exp(iΩ t)  +  c.c.   with  fixed  Ω   and  without  loss  of  generality  real  positive  U.  The

approximations used above now give

dV / dt − (1/ 2)ε(1− 6βV 2 )V + (1/ 2Ω)µV

= −(U Ω / 2)Im{DT12 exp(−iξ) /T22(T11 + DG)}

  

(16)

dξ/ dt = (ω− Ω) + (U / 2V )Ω Re{T12 exp(−iξ) / C(T11 + DG)}      (17)

This is very similar to Adler's equation[14,9,13].

For sufficiently small detuning | ω−Ω |  <    Ω (U/2V) | T12 /C(T11+DG) |, the nonlinear ODE

(17)  has  stationary  solutions  at  two  distinct  values  of  ξ.    Each  solution  corresponds  to  an

entrainment of the oscillator to the frequency of the incident field.   Stability at the stationary point

requires  that  we  choose  the  solution  with  Im{T12exp(-iξ)/C(T11+ D G)}  <  0.     The  phase  at

10

so

and

€ 

€ 

entrainment is complicated, but in the absence of detuning (ω = Ω), there is a simple expression for

it:

exp(−iξ) = −i(DT12 /T22(T11 + DG)) */ | DT12 /T22(T11 + DG) |     

(18)

Comparison with 16 shows that the stable solution for ξ corresponds to (16) having a positive

€ 

right hand side, i.e., the stable phase at entrainment is such that the amplitude V of the oscillator is

augmented  relative  to  its  value  in  the  absence  of  an  incident  field.    Increased  V  corresponds  to

increased  nonlinear  energy  dissipation  in  the  circuit.   That  conclusion  is  independent  of  the

parameters T of the two-port network, and independent of the degree of detuning.  Thus this would

appear to be stimulated absorption, and the behaviors observed in the laboratory (see section IV)

would appear to be not represented in this model.

Such a conclusion would be premature.  While the flow of energy out of the nonlinear circuit

into the transducer is, apparently, decreased by the incident acoustic field, the flow of energy out of

the transducer into the medium differs from that by dissipation in the transducer.    Thus the model

may yet describe stimulated emission, but only if the transducer is dissipative and only if power

dissipation within the transducer is lessened by the presence of the incident field.

Thus  we  are  led  to  ask  about  the  radiation  of  energy  into  the  mechanical  medium.    The

power radiated from the device is  Π = - f x du/dt = f x { -duinc/dt + dG/dt  f }   which is (by 14)

        

Π = [T11 + DG]−1(T21v + Duinc ) × dG /dt [T11 + DG]−1(T21v + Duinc )
−[T11 + DG]−1(T21v + Duinc ) × {duinc /dt}

(19)

The terms in v2 are almost identical to the spontaneous emission rate, differing only in that V

is now slightly different.   The terms in uinc  2 are independent of V, and presumably due to passive

€ 

losses  on  scattering  off  the  dissipative  parts  of  [T].    This  presumption  is  supported  by  a  short

11

calculation that shows, for the case T = real, that the term in uinc2 vanishes.   The cross terms, in V x

U, resemble stimulated emission and absorption.  These terms are

ΠUV =| T11 + DG |−2

[T21v × (dG / dt) Duinc + Duinc × (dG /dt)T21v − (T11 + DG)*T21v × duinc /dt]

 

(20)

On time averaging, we recover:

€ 

ΠUV = 2ΩUV | T11 + DG |−2
Im[T21

* exp(−iξ)(T11 + DG*)]

(21)

(22)

€ 

€ 

A substitution of the expression (18) for ξ valid in the absence of de-tuning, gives

ΠUV =− 2ΩUV | T22 | / | T11 + DG || DT12 |

Re[T21

*2(D /T22)*[(T11 + DG*)/(T11 + DG)*]

If T is real, this is manifestly negative.   [We recall that D/T22  = C is the free capacitance and its real

part is presumably positive.]  We therefore conclude, as in the paragraph following eqn(18), that real

T implies that the UV part of the power flow into the mechanical medium is negative, i.e, that the

entrained oscillator absorbs energy from the field incident upon it.

If the elements of [ T ] are complex, the conclusion can differ.   The expressions (21,22) are

complicated, but permit some simplifications.  For the case in which T is dominated by positive real

parts of the elements on its diagonal, D and T11 are very nearly real; the ratio  [(T11 + D G* )/ (  T11 +

D G)* ] is unity; (D/T22 ) ~ T11 is real and positive, and ΠUV is positive if T21 is imaginary regardless

of G.  Thus stimulated emission depends chiefly on the phase of T12.

If we suppose instead that T is dominated by the real part of T11, with all other elements being

complex and of equal small order, then D ~ T11 T22 and

12

ΠUV =− 2ΩUV | T22 | / | T11 + DG || DT12 |
*2T11(1+ T22G*) /(1+ T22

Re[T21

*G*)]

(23)

In this case the sign of ΠUV depends on the phase of T12 and also, if the magnitude of T22G is of order

unity or larger, on the phase of T22.

€ 

We conclude that at least for some sets of parameters the model exhibits stimulated emission.

For sufficiently weak de-tuning, and for transducers with lossy electro-mechanical coupling, we

expect an incident field to stimulate emission.   A set of several such piezoelectric auto-oscillators on

an acoustic cavity should behave such that their net energy emission scales with the square of the

number of entrained oscillators, i.e, the system should be superradiant, [18] like some lasers.  In the

next section we illustrate this conclusion by means of numerical simulations.

IID  Amplitude dependent frequencies

In the above model, the natural frequencies of the auto-oscillators are independent of their

amplitude.   This  is  perhaps  the  simplest  model,  and  it  is  encouraging  that  it  permits  stimulated

emission.  Nevertheless, we have seen signs of some amplitude dependence in our electronics, and it

is not unreasonable to presume that, as its resistance varies with amplitude, so might the negistor's

capacitance.  Thus it may be indicated to investigate the implications of a generalizing the van-der

Pol model to a Landau-Stuart form[9].  It may be that stimulated emission does not require that the

transducers have lossy properties.    It is outside our present purpose to investigate this further.

The above theory may be illustrated by numerical simulation.  We consider the following

This set of parameters may be thought of as describing the purely mechanical system pictured in

the negistor is represented by the nonlinear damper whose differential velocity d(q-ζ)/dt is given by

the function I(v) of the force v across it.  Governing equations include force balance v-f=kq, and a

constitutive relation for the linear resistance element f = η d(q+u)/dt.

We take Ω = k = 1 without loss of generality, and choose √k/M to be in the vicinity of Ω.

In  order  that  the  limit  cycle  be  smooth,  we  take  ε  to  be  small  (typically,  0.1).    To  preserve  the

14

instability of the q = u = 0 solution in the absence of an incident field, we choose η to be less than ε;

η = 0.06.     This assures that the coupling is weak.   So that G is smooth, we take τ = 1.    These

choices lead to the following evaluations in the vicinity of ω = 1

G = 1/[1-ω2+iω] ~ 2(1-ω)   - i

ω = [ 1 – ε2/16 ] / √M  + 5η2/8;    µ =η/2

(26)

The last line follows from theory that predicts the frequency of the limit cycle. The formula for the

limit cycle frequency when not coupled to the acoustic cavity, 1/√LC, was modified to account for

finite ε [17], hence the term in ε2/16.

The coupled differential equations are solved by fourth order Runge-Kutta, where at each

step the code must solve a cubic equation for v in terms of q, dζ/dt   and du/dt.   The code is started

with generic nearly quiescent initial conditions, q, ζ, dζ/dt = random small << 1.  Typical run times

are thousands of cycles.  All results are for the steady state.

In  the  case  F0  =  0,  ie.,  without  an  incident  field,  theory  above  predicts  values  for  the

frequency of oscillation, for the amplitude V, and for the rate of spontaneous emission.  Figures 4a,b

show that the steady state frequency, for the case M =1 and various values of ε and η, indeed varies

with η like the prediction:  [ 1–ε2/16 ]/√M  + 5η2/8.

Figure 4] The dependence of the limit cycle frequency, obtained from numerical solution of Eqs. 26

at F0=0 on ε (a) and η (b). The results of the simulations (symbols) are compared to the theoretical

approximations (solid lines).

For the case of arbitrary F0, we look for the presence of entrainment, such that the device, as

represented by the time dependence of q, oscillates at the applied frequency Ω (=1) rather than the

frequency it would take on its own.  Theory above says that entrainment will occur for sufficiently

weak de-tuning, |Ω-ω| < (η/2) |U/V|, where V is the amplitude of the autonomous auto-oscillator,

approximately [(εΩ-µ)/6εΩβ]1/2 ~ 0.34, and U is the amplitude of the incident field, U = F0/2.    For

parameters η=0.06, ε = 0.1, entrainment is predicted for values of |ω−Ω| < 0.045 (at F0=1.0). This is

in good agreement with numerical simulation and with common understanding [13].

We also evaluate the average rate at which the device does work on the cavity

                     

 Π =   -η< ˙ u  ( ˙ u + ˙ q )>timeaverage

and study in particular how this varies with F0 and with detuning.  This quantity is not discussed in

the literature on entrainment[ - ], but as it is central to the proposed construction of a laser analog, it

€ 

is studied here.  Figure 5 shows the power inflow as a function of detuning for the case F0 = 0.5 and

16

F0 = 1.0    It may be seen that the net inflow is positive in the limit of no detuning, and negative at

high detuning.

Figure 5] Entrainment (locking) of the oscillator to the driving incident field with F0=0.5 (squares)

and F0=1.0 (circles).   The horizontal arrows indicate the regime over which the oscillator locks to

the applied frequency.  The inset shows an example of the entrainment.

The character of the power flow is best illustrated, as in Fig 6a, as a continuous function of

F0,  and  for  the  case  of  no  detuning.   At  Fo=0, the emission is spontaneous and equal to 0.00093,

which may be compared to the prediction of 0.0008 from eqn (13).     An analytic treatment of the

specific model (24) predicts 0.00096.  At small F0 the power inflow increases linearly with F0, that

is, with the incident wave amplitude U = F0/2.   The slope of that dependence is predicted by the

stimulated emission formula Eq. 22, which for the present parameters is ΠUV =  - 2ΩUinc V | T22 |  /  (

| T11+DG| | DT12  |  )  Re{   T21*2  (D/T22 )*   [(  T11 + D G* )/ (  T11 + D G)* ]   } = 0.017 Fo, in rough

accord with the parabolic fit's slope of 0.0235.  The difference is ascribed to changes in the terms v2

17

neglected following equation (19).    Figure 6a shows that the inflow is negative at large F0, where

the flow is dominated by passive losses proportional to U2.

Figure 6b shows the predicted value V = 0.034 at Fo= 0, and the predicted (see discussion

following eqn 18) increase of V for F0 > 0.   At F0

cr=1.15 the total emission vanishes even at zero

detuning, c.f. Figure 6a.  At this point U, V and Q (the amplitude of q) all become equal to F0/2. v

and q oscillate in phase, and opposite to that of u. For F0 greater then F0

cr, the amplitude Uinc exceeds

V and the net flow is negative.

emission/absorption  rate  as  a  function

of  F0  (symbols)  fitted  with  a  parabola

Limit cycle values of Utotal, V and Q for

different  F0.  Crossing  point  U  =  Q  at

F0=1.15  corresponds  to  the  transition

from net emission to net absorption.

Numerical simulations thus confirm key predictions of the theory above.   In particular we

see the familiar phenomena of spontaneous emission, and entrainment.   We also see the predicted

stimulated emission, and its quantitative accord with theory.

IV  Laboratory studies

18

We have investigated these predictions in the laboratory by constructing the "negistor," or "lambda

diode,"[19] illustrated in figure [7], and incorporating it into a LC oscillator where the capacitance is

provided chiefly by a piezoelectric transducer.

Figure  7]   A lambda diode, or

negistor, is constructed from two

transistors.  It has a current

voltage relation as shown in the

inset to figure 1.  When it is

incorporated into a circuit with an

inductor L ( ~ 220 µH) and a

capacitance C as provided by the

piezoelectric transducer and its

cables (~200 pf), the circuit auto-

oscillates at a frequency of about

ω = 1/√LC.

We  find  that  the  circuit  auto-oscillates  in  a  periodic  nearly  harmonic  limit  cycle  whose

frequency is tunable by varying L or by adding additional capacitance.  Here, and in all cases below,

the  spectral  width  of  the  auto-oscillation  is  finer  than  our  precision  of  1  to  10  Hz.   Line  width

appears to be governed by background noise and spectral intensity as is the Schawlow-Townes line

width of a laser.  It has recently been investigated for an ultrasonic system with gain [20].   When the

piezoelectric transducer is then attached to an elastic body, the frequency of oscillation shifts, as in

figure  [8].   Frequency  changes  can  be  different  depending  on  the  position  of  attachment,  the

material, the size of the solid body, or the presence of oil couplant.   Frequencies always increase

when the transducer is placed on the body, reflecting an increase in effective stiffness.  No change in

19

frequency is attendant upon additional grounding of the transducer case, so changes may be ascribed

to the mechanics, not the electronics.  Changes are small compared to natural frequency of the order

of 500 kHz (as specified by the choice of L and additional capacitances).

position number

Figure 8]  The frequency of auto oscillation varies by about 1 kHz as the transducer is alternately in

contact (filled circles) and out of contact (open circles) with the aluminum block.    Slight variations

in  the  frequency  of  the  non-contact  case  are  ascribed  to  stray  capacitances  due  to  the  operator's

hands.   Variations  in  the  attached  case  are  ascribed  to  variations  in  coupling  strength  as  the

transducer is re-attached, and perhaps to variations in local Greens function.

Theoretical frequency2 is given by the real part of [ (LC)–1+ { T12 T21 Ω2 / T22 [ T11+ DG] } ].

From the observed magnitude of the frequency changes in figure 8 as G is alternated between ∞ and

the G of the elastic body in different places, and based upon statistically identical data from steel

where G is smaller than it is in aluminum, we estimate   Re (T12  T21  /  T22  T11)   to be of the order

0.004,  and  DG  to  be  less  than  T11.   It  is  worth  noting  that  in  a  system  with  high  modal  overlap

(meaning level-spacings are much less than absorption widths) such as the one used in generating

figure  8,  Gxx  has  fluctuations,  from  place  to  place  or  frequency  to  frequency,  that  are  small;

20

|δGxx|/|Gxx|  << 1 [21].  G is very nearly equal to the value it would take in an infinite half space.   For

this reason the frequency of auto-oscillation ought to depend only weakly on position x.

We  study  the  occurrence  of  entrainment  by  adding  an  incident  field  by  means  of  the

transducer  at  point  z  in  figure  1.    We  seek  the  conditions  under  which  the  nonlinear  electronic

circuit adopts the frequency of the applied field.  Figure [9] shows (continuous curve) a short section

of the spectrum of the transfer function between the generator and the monitor, |hzy|  on  a  70  mm

aluminum cube with a surface treatment that enhanced dissipation.   ( On ignoring scattering by the

transducers  one  can  calculate  this  transfer  function  in  terms  of  other  quantities  that  have  been

defined here:  hzy ≈ T12 Gzy T21 / (1+T22Gzz)(1+T22Gyy) ~ T12

2 Gzy.)  The bold vertical lines indicate the

frequency of the generator at z (757.8kHz) and that of the undisturbed oscillator in contact with the

solid (758.63kHz).  The several isolated points indicate the frequency, and rms amplitude, received

at y, due to the oscillator, at each of eleven equally spaced generator amplitudes from 0.0 to 5.0

volts.   It may be seen that the oscillator frequency is pulled towards that of the generator, and that

the degree of pulling is monotonic in generator strength.  This behavior is familiar from the literature

on  entrainment  of  auto-oscillators.   Less  familiar  are  the  occasional  discontinuities.   The  two

discontinuities,  between  3.5  and  4.0  volts,  and  between  4.5  and  5.0  volts  where  locking  ensues,

appear to correspond to features in the transfer function h of the passive cavity.  They are related to

the random reverberant nature of the wave propagation and are not found in the standard model of

frequency-independent coupling.

Figure 10 shows the behavior of the entrainment as the frequency of the applied cw signal

from the generator is varied, at a fixed amplitude of 5.0 volts.  Frequency is varied in 0.2 kHz steps

from 757.0 to 759.8 kHz.   The natural frequency of the auto oscillator in contact with the body is

indicated  by  the  thin  vertical  line  at  758.63  kHz.  In  the  absence  of  full  entrainment  the  auto-

21

oscillator frequency is pulled towards that of the generator.  It may be seen that the auto-oscillator is

entrained to the applied frequency if the applied frequency is close to the natural frequency, and if

the signal from the generator at z as received at the auto-oscillator at x is strong enough, ie., if the

transfer  function  is  large.   Entrainment  is  thus  a  complicated  non-monotonic  function  of  applied

frequency.

Figure  9]  The  nonlinear  oscillator's  frequency  (isolated  points)  is  pulled,  monotonically  and

discontinuously, as the signal strength from the generator at y is increased from 0 to 5 volts in 0.5

volt steps.    The continuous curve is the transfer function h between monitor and generator.   The

bold  vertical  lines  mark  the  positions  of  the  spectral  lines  (one  at  757.79  due  to  the  generator,

another at 758.63 due to the uninfluenced auto-oscillator) at vanishing voltage from the generator.

frequency  (kHz)

Figure 10] A study of entrainment versus the frequency of the entraining field at fixed cw source

amplitude of 5 volts. The frequency of the auto-oscillator at x is 759.63 kHz in the absence of an

applied field, as indicated by the vertical line.  The irregular smooth curve shows the (scaled to fit)

transfer function |hxz(ω)|  between  the  source  of  the  entraining  field  and  the  position  of  the  auto-

oscillator.    Open circles indicate the frequency of the entraining field as specified by the operator.

Closed  circles  indicate  the  frequency  of  the  auto-oscillator  as  it  is  pulled  towards  that  of  the

entraining field.  The structure of the entrainment is complex, and the process is non-monotonic and

discontinuous, influenced as it is by the complicated function h(ω).

We also studied the energy in the system as a function of the amplitude of the applied field,

and did so with primary focus on the case of no de-tuning, i.e, for Ω = ω.  Being unable to measure

|hxz(ω)|

23

the power inflow at x, we instead measured the signal strength at y and interpreted it as a measure of

the (square root of the) energy in the cavity.  This is an imperfect measure of acoustic energy unless

the system has low modal overlap and the frequency of interest is near one of the modes, so that only

one natural mode is excited.    Thus we chose a cavity that is a thin rod, with low modal density and

modest absorption, as pictured in figure 11.

Figure 11]    The system is attached to an aluminum rod of 15 cm length and 3.16 mm diameter.

Below 580 kHz, it has four propagating guided modes of elastic waves.

We also recognize that the total energy in the cavity is proportional to the sum of the power

flows from the nonlinear circuit at x and the generator at z.   The energy generated in the acoustic

cavity may be decomposed in two terms, each equal to the time-average of the dynamic force at a

transducer times the material velocity at the same point.   This quantity at x, it was shown above, has

a term in V2 and a term in UV, where U is the field incident from the prescribed forcing at z and

proportional to the cw signal input strength 'g' from the generator.    The work done at z, however,

includes not only a term in g2, but also a term in gV due to the field incident from x.    Thus the

energy  produced  in  the  acoustic  cavity  includes  the  intuitive  g2  and  V2  terms,  and  the  gV  term

described above, but another term scaling like gV that was not discussed above.    Analysis shows

that the excess stimulated emission of energy at z is of the same order as that at x, but with a phase

depending on the phase of Ggu.  It is not necessarily positive, even if ΠUV is positive.  Nevertheless,

24

for  the  case  of  low  modal  overlap,  the  two  terms  have  the  same  sign  and  the  total  energy  in  the

cavity can be a proxy for the power flow from the nonlinear circuit.

Figure 12 shows the rms of the cw signal observed at the monitor at y for various levels of

the applied cw input at z.   Stimulated emission is apparent in the positive slope of the upper curve at

g=0.   Figure 12b shows the difference of the squares of the curves in 12a, thus corresponding to the

energy of spontaneous emission at g=0 plus the UV part linear in g that corresponds to stimulated

emission.     Stimulated emission is apparent in the positive slope.  Power output is greater than the

sum of the power outputs from the nonlinear circuit and the generator when they operate alone.

Figure 12]  Evidence of stimulated emission and absorption in the rod of figure 11.  The rms signal

amplitude at y is plotted against the amplitude of the signal from the generator into z, for the case of

the auto oscillator powered (filled circles) and unpowered (empty squares).   The difference of their

squares  is  also  plotted,  indicating  a  coherent  interference,  i.e  stimulated  emission  (top  case)  and

absorption (bottom case).

V Uasing

On replacing the generator–driven transducer at z with one or more additional van der Pol

auto-oscillating  transducer  circuits,  as  in  figure  13,  we  have  what  may  be  termed  a  "uaser"

(Ultrasound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation [7]), an acoustic analog to a laser.

The  system  is  similar  to  that  encountered  when  two  or  more  Josephson  junctions  couple  and

synchronize through their microwave radiation field [8] also noted as analogous to a laser.  The data

26

presented  here  are  not  meant  to  fully  elucidate  the  properties  of  such  systems.   Rather  these

illustrations are presented merely to provoke imagination and suggest further studies.    A thorough

study awaits development of a theory to inform such experiments.

Figure 13] Two or three autonomous nonlinear piezoelectric oscillators are placed in contact with the
aluminum rod of figure 11.  The acoustic state is monitored with a passive detector.

Figure 14a]    Two auto-oscillators are placed on the rod of figure 13 ( at positions 1 and 2).   The

resulting signal is monitored at position 3.  Three transfer functions h (continuous lines) are plotted.

We also plot the rms amplitude and frequency at the monitor (bold vertical lines) for each of three

cases:  only auto-oscillator number 1 powered (label U1), only oscillator number 2 powered (U2, not

labeled in figure), and both powered (label U1&2).   On normalizing these amplitudes to the strength

of the transfer functions, we find that U1&2 is within 2% of the sum of U1 and U2.  The two auto-

oscillators not only lock to a single frequency, but contribute in phase to the signal at the monitor.

27

Figure 14b] as in 14a, but with a different position for the monitor (4).  Again the amplitudes add.

Figure  14c]   As  in  14a,  but  with  the  auto-oscillators  tuned  to  a  different  frequency  range.

Again the amplitudes add to within 2%.   Not shown, a figure analogous to 14b with monitor

at position 4, but for the case of tuning near 471.5 kHz, and for which the amplitudes again

add.

28

Figures 14 compare the rms amplitude detected by the monitor, and the frequency of

that signal, on powering one, or two, auto-oscillators.  14a) and 14b) are for a case in which

both auto-oscillators are tuned to a frequency near 476 kHz, near a maximum in the transfer

functions.   Regardless of the position (3 or 4) of the monitor, we find that the (normalized)

amplitudes add; that is, the net energy in the cavity is greater than the sum of the energies due

to  each  oscillator  alone.    Normalization  is  effected  by  replacing  the  rms  amplitude  U1  at

frequency f1  with  U1  h13(f12)/h13(f1), and U2 with U2 h23(f12)/h23(f2).   We then compare U12

with  U1  h13(f12)/h13(f1),  +  U2  h23(f12)/h23(f2).    14c)  shows  the  same  phenomenon  when  the

oscillators are tuned to a frequency near 471 kHz, a minimum in the transfer function.   For

almost  all  cases  we  have  investigated  on  the  rod,  the  amplitudes  add.   Occasionally,  they

subtract.  It is apparent that this synchronization is similar to that described elsewhere[ 9-12,

esp  13  chapters  10  and  11]  except  that  here  we  also  emphasize  issues  of  wave  power

generation, stimulated emission and super radiance.

Figure  15]  shows  a  case  of  three  auto-oscillators.   For  reference,  we  plot  the  three

transfer functions h14, h24, and h34 between the auto-oscillators and the monitor at position 4.

Bold  vertical  lines  indicate  the  (un-normalized)  rms  amplitudes  of  each  individual  auto-

oscillator, of each pair, and of all three.   The normalized amplitudes of individual oscillators

1 and 2  (6.53 and 2.43 when referred to frequency 476.114) add to approximate the amplitude

of that pair together (8.27).  The normalized amplitudes of oscillators 2 and 3 (2.45 and 7.15

when referred to frequency 476.095) add to approximate the amplitude of that pair together

(9.20).   These pairs both add constructively.  Oscillators 1 and 3 have normalized amplitudes

(5.19 and 4.73 when referred to frequency 476.482) that roughly subtract to approximate the

amplitude (1.05) of that pair together.    Oscillators 1 2 and 3 (normalized amplitudes 7.31,

29

2.66,  and  7.88  respectively  when  referred  to  frequency  475.959)  very  nearly  add  to

approximate  the  amplitude  of  all  three  together  (15.93).    Acoustic  energy  is  generated

coherently, and at more than twice the rate that would be obtained in the absence of feedback.

The system is super-radiant.

Figure  15] Three  auto-oscillators  are  monitored  by  a  single  receiver  at  point  4.   The  rms

signal strengths (rescaled to fit on the plot) are indicated by the vertical lines.   Amplitudes of

single auto-oscillators (thin vertical lines) are compared to those when auto-oscillators are

taken in pairs (wider lines), and when all three auto-oscillators are powered (widest line).

VI Summary

It  has  been  shown  that  nonlinear  van-der  Pol-like  piezoelectric  oscillators  can  be

configured to exhibit the key behaviors required of sets of neighboring continuously pumped

"atoms" in a classical analog for a laser.    These include frequency locking, stimulated and

30

spontaneous  emission,  stimulated  absorption,  and  super-radiance.   We  conjecture  that  the

principles  illustrated  here  will  find  direct  application  in  the  construction  of  new  kinds  of

acoustic generators, and indirect application in scale-model emulation of laser dynamics, in

particular in research on random[22] and chaotic[23] and photonic crystal lasers[24].

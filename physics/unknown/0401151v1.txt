Abstract:

results:

The  derivation  of  the  Maxwell  equations  is  reproduced  whereby

magnetic  charges  are  included.  This  ansatz  yields  following

1)  Longitudinal  Ampère  forces  in  a  differential  magnetostatic

force  law  are  improbable.  Otherwise  a  electric  current  would

generate magnetic charges.

2) Simple magnetic and electric induced polarization phenomena

are completely analogous and are described by a Laplace equation.

3) Permanent magnetic fields can be understood to be caused by

magnetic  charges.  Consequently,  a  moving  permanent  magnet

represents  a magnetic current which generates a electric field.

4) The electromagnetic tensors of energy and momentum have some

additional terms which are written down generally.

5)  If  the  electric  material  parameters  are  influenced  by  non-

electric variables (for instance temperature or pressure), the

formalism of electrodynamics is not sufficient to describe the

system and has to be completed by further differential equations

from the other areas of physics.

6) Nonlinear electro-thermodynamic systems may violate the second

law of thermodynamics. This is illustrated by a electric cycle

with a data storing FET invented by Yusa & Sakaki.

1) Introduction

The  Maxwell  equations  are  about  150  Jahre  old.  They  are  the

mathematical compilation of the experiments and considerations

based  on  the  original  work  of  Cavendish,  Coulomb,  Poisson,

Ampère, Faraday and others [1]. Mathematically they are partial

differential equations. Different notations exist for them: most

popular is the vector notation (O. Heaviside), which replaced the

original notations in quaternions  (J.C. Maxwell).  More modern

is the tensor notation (H. Minkowski, A. Einstein), which is able

to  describe  situations  which  are  discussed  in  the  theory  of

relativity  [2].  All  notations  are  equivalent  in  the  non-

relativistic limit. The Maxwell equations were very successful.

Until today their range of applicability grows permanently. 

Here a short derivation is given which especially takes account

of the newer developments of material descriptions. Furthermore,

monopoles are included because Ehrenhaft proved their existence

already  50  years  ago  [3-6].  It  will  be  shown  that  the  theory

needs  also  their  existence  for  a  full  description  of  all

problems.  This  explains  perhaps  effects  which  are  regarded

generally  as  dubious  because  they  cannot  be  understood  in  a

conventional approach.

2) The equations of the electromagnetic field 

 a) The laws of Coulomb and the equation of Poisson

The so called Coulomb law describes the force between electric

charges. It was discovered by Priestley in 1767 [1, 7]. Cavendish

rediscovered  it  again  and  measured  as  well  the  dielectricity

constant.  However,  due  to  many  contributions  to  the  knowledge

about  electricity  it  has  the  name  of  the  third  discoverer

Couloumb [1]. 

The Coulomb law in the notation of today is [8]

  constraints for the material properties

In the most cases it is possible to make simplifying constraints

for  the  material  properties.  In  order  to  explain  this  it  is

necessary  to  write  down  the  potential  -

P(x)  of  the  multipole

5

expansion  of  the  charges  in  the  material  [9].  A  multipole

expansion of the potential calculates the distribution of charge

in space about a origin 0 as a serie of moments

The  first  term  represents  induced  charges  for  instance  if

recombination processes in semiconductors have to be accounted

assumed  and  the  first  term  becomes  zero.  Furthermore  oftenly

higher  terms  are  neglected  because  they  are  quantitatively

irrelevant. Then, after integration over the whole space holds

 b) Ampère´s law

The discovery of electromagnetism by Oersted  [10, 11] in 1820

inspired some researchers in France to find the quantitative laws

of these effects.  Especially, Biot&Savart and Ampère tackled the

task to solve this problem by intelligent experiments [1, 11].

In  order  to  fit  their  experiment  to  the  theory  they  made

additional assumptions. This led to different laws for the forces

between differential conductors. The discussion of this  problem

is running until today.

Biot and Savart [12-14] found out that “the total force which is

exerted by a file of infinite lenght under current on a element

of  austral  or  boreal  magnetism  in  the  distance  FA  or  FB,  is

perpendicular on the shortest distance between the molecule and

the file (see figs.1)”. This law is written today in a form which

goes back to Grassmann [11, 15]. It holds [8]

fig.1a: the Biot-Savart - setup 
A magnetic needle is under the influence of the
field of current CZ .  A cover protects against
the movement of air. The magnet A’B’ compen-
sates the magnetism of earth where the needle
is located.

Fig.1b: the Biot-Savart - setup
measuring the time constant of the torsion
pendulum it is concluded on the force of the
field on the needle, if the current flows.
Distance and angle of the file are varied in the
experiments.

with    i1/2  :=  current,  ds1/2  :=  length  of  file  element,  r:=

distance between file elements.

Ampère idolized a  little  bit. So  he  assumed,  1)  that  Newton’s

3.axiom (actio-reactio) also holds for electromagnetism, and 2)

that the force between single elements of current is a central

force and lies on the distance line between the elements.

Based on his own experiments on closed circuits Ampère included

the following observations [16, 17] in his  theory, see fig.2a-d:

1)  The  force  of  a  file  under  current  reverses  if  the  current

reverses, see fig.2a.

2)  the  forces  of  a  current,  which  flows  in  a  smooth  circular

circuit,  is  the  same,  if  the  “circle”  of  the  current  is  not

smooth but sinoidal, see. fig.2b.

3) the force of a closed current on a single current element is

perpendicular to it, see fig.2c .

4) the force between two current elements does not change if all

spatial  dimensions  of  the  setup  are  enlarged  by  a  constant

factor, see fig. 2d.

Applying  these  observations  Ampère  constructed  his  force  law.

Based on  Ampere´s assumption it holds for the force 

F(cid:16) r

. The

observations 1)+ 2) suggest for first order

fig.2a: Ampère´s first experiment
AB is a fixed conductor under current. The
circuits  d’c’fe and cde’f’ are stiffly connected ,
are symmetrical over AB and can rotate about
the axis x’y’. Their orientation of the current is
opposite in these circuits; experimental result:
no rotation due to complete balance of opposite
forces

fig.2b: Ampère´s second experiment
in a trench Nut PQ flows a current Strom in
straight conductor, in the trench SR in a sinoidal
conductor. The circuits BCDE and FGHI
mounted stiffly together, but rotate around the
Axis AK . The same current flows througth
them, however in opposite direction.
experimental result: only if the circuit is exaxtly
thr conductors all forces compensate and no
movement is observable.

fig.2c: Ampère´s third Experiment
M and M’ are trenches filled with mercury, arm
OC can be turned. The current flows over the
troughs M back to the arm OC. The arm turns
into the middle, where a equilibrium of torque
exists and where all forces on OC apply
perpendicular.

fig.2d: Ampère´s fourth Experiment
the outer circuits are fixed, the circuit in the
middle can move. Only, if the diameters fullfil
the relation dleft :dmiddle =dmiddle:dright, all forces
compensate and the circuit in the middle NOM
does not move.

Because the integral over the circuit is zero, a potential exist and consequently

also a total differential. If the circuit is chosen to be a round circuit one can

replace by ds1=-dr and write

Riemann  [18]  and  Whittaker  [1]  checked  this  derivation  and

realized, that Ampère’s workout is only one possible ansatz to

explain the observations. They doubted in Ampère’s assumption,

that  the  force  between  current  elements  is  a  central  force,

because the forces could be as well angular moments [19]. They

found  other  possible  formulas,  which  could  explain  all

observations.  Whittaker  enlarged  Ampère’s  formula,  by  adding

terms, which were in accordance with observation, because they

were zero after integration over a closed circuit. So he made the

general ansatz:

Whittaker dropped the Ampère’s assumption, that the force should

be  a  central  force  and  used  only  Newton’s  law  actio-reactio.

Under  all  possibilities  he  chosed  the  most  simple  possibility

$(r) (cid:10) i.i´/(c 2r 3)

 ,

$´(r) (cid:10) (cid:9)3i.i´/(c 2r 3)

Of course this force law was not convincing as well.

For  the  basic  idea  of  Riemann  and  Whittaker  was  used  by  many

others who built their “own” force laws using other assumptions.

The discussion is running until today, see[23] and tab.1.

All  different  forms  yielded  the  same  result  for  the  magnetic

general scheme of proof for every magnetostatic force law:

According  to  a  general  theorem  of  vector  analysis,  see  appendix  2,  every

vector field can be decomposed into a vortex field and a potential field. The

vortex field is caused by currents, the potential field by charges. If this

is compared with theorem 2 in appendix 2, then the Biot-Savart law generates

a  vortex  field.  All  other  fields  deviating  from  Biot-Savart,  have  to  be

field law = Biot-Savart-law + additional terms

These  additional  terms  must  be  identified  as  a  potential  field.  If  the

current  is  integrated  over  a  closed  circle  the  potential  terms  cancel  to

written as

zero1  .

The force of a closed circuit on a differential current element

is according to Biot-Savart, see (18) and (22),

From (22) also follows, that the magnetic field can be calculated

 The Biot-Savart law is probably the correct version for
physical currents. It does not generate “magnetic charges” and
coincides with the B-field of a moving charge according to
Lienard-Wiechert(in the special case of zero acceleration).
Experimentally the Biot-Savart - law is supported by the
measurements of Cavallieri [23].

So  Ampère  concluded:  The  cause  of  the  magnetic  field  are  not

magnetic charges but only currents.

Ampère’s theory includes as well para-, dia- oder ferromagnetic

“excited” material. The total magnetic field B includes the field

from the measurable currents j and the field M of the magnetism

of  the  material,  where  the  field  M  (according  to  Ampère)  is

generated exclusively by currents in the material. Then follows

oder

Analogously  like  for  charges  a  relation  is  sought  between  the

empirical variables. So the unknown current jmaterial is eliminated.

If compared with electrostatics, see eq. (14) bis (17), it can

be  derived  for  currents,  that  for    magnetostatics  holds

can contribute to the result. So a definition (29) analogous to

(17) is used for the magnetization M of the material

and

/´ 2 |x(cid:9)x´|(cid:9)1 (cid:10) (cid:9)4(cid:140)/(x(cid:9)x´)

because A also fulfills the Poisson equation 

/2A(cid:10) (cid:9)4(cid:140) j/c

Now,  the  observation  is  used  that  no  charges  build  up  during

magnetostatic  experiments.  Using  the  continuity  equation  this

fact can translated into mathematics by 

/´ j´ (cid:16) (cid:9)

Oftenly,  it  is  assumed  div  A  =0.  This  expression  is  known  as

because A can be replaced by A*= A + /f(x) . The important point

for the choice of vector potential A is that grad div A=? has to

be  chosen  such,  that  a  physically  motivated  constraint  is

fulfilled - the continuity equation [26].

At the time of Biot&Savart and Ampère this was not known fully

and only the closed circuits could be tested out. So the result

(22) for the H-Feld was ok. . However later, after the discovery

of the electron by J.J. Thomson [27], discussions came up due to

the  basic  problem  behind  the  approaches  of  Biot&Savart  and

Ampère: Not every magnetic problem could be discussed by a closed

electric circuit. Freely moving charges (as differential current

elements) could exist and the question for their field had to be

solved. So observations were published that longitudinal forces

existed in railguns [28, 29] and in plasma tubes [30, 31]  (See

also  the  review  article  by  [32]).  These  forces  seemed  to  be

explained by Ampere’s differential force law, but not by Biot-

16

Savart´s  version2.  Althought  these  problems  seem  to  be  solved

today not in the favour for longitunal forces the problem will

be  left  open  here  for  further  considerations.  So  all

mathematically possible field configurations will be included in

the  discussion  by  adding  a  magnetic  potential  to  the  magnetic

vector field. So any vector field F can be decomposed into two

terms FC and FV, derived from a potential (for FC) and a vector

potential of vortex field (for FV), see the proof in appendix 2

[26] and [35, 36]. Thus any H-Feld is described by

general field and loses all symmetry properties with respect of

parity. So every problem with magnetized matter can be described.

It  will  be  shown  here  that  this  is  useful  for  problems  with

induced and permanent magnetization. Only a reinterpretation of

the conventional point of view leads to a Poisson equation for

magnetic charges.

Proof:

The conventional theory for problems with permant magnetization [8] (without

exciting field from outside) assumes, that

Here is M the magnetization of the material and H0 the inner magnetic field

which generates the magnetization. If a field is applied additionally from

outside, this equation is enlarged

(38)

(39)

with  H  a  the  exciting    H-field  from  outside,  which  is  added.  Because  no

currents  are  obvious  in  matter  as  cause  for  the  inner  H0-field  it  holds

/×H0

(cid:10) 0

 . This means that H0 can be derived from a potential 

 according

with

/.H0

 as “effective magnetic charge density”.

From (39) and (40) folllows 

/.B :(cid:10) /.(H (cid:8) 4(cid:140)M) (cid:10) (cid:9)4(cid:140)!M:(cid:10) 4(cid:140)!H

With these redefinitions the conventional equation (39) is written down with

magnetic charges in a form, which is completely analog to electrostatics.

Then,  analogously  to  electrostatics,  the  empirical  field  is  the  H-field

contrary to the conventional interpretation taking the B-field. q.e.d.  a

Thus,  magnetostatic  boundary  problems  can  be  worked  out

analogously to electrostatics with changed boundary conditions.

Textbooks show [8], that the solution of magnetic boundary

boundary condition between inner of bowl and outside:no charges and no currents, i.e. 
Binnen=Baußen , similar like in electrostatics the field is given by the charge distribution at the outer
boundary: By=0 , /Blinks = -/Brechts . It holds the Laplace equation -ß3=/B=0. For the equations of a
metal bowl in the electric field electric variables have to be replaced by electric ones.

19

problems  are  sometimes  completely  analogous  to  electrostatic

problems,  because  the  equations  of  the  problem  are  analogous.

Similarly, permanent magnets (like an analog to ferroelectrets)

can be regarded to consist of magnetic charges. 

For the simple phenomena of induced polarization, see fig.3, the

fields are derived by the assumptions, that B is the solution of

the equation 

/.B (cid:10) 0

. The boundary condition represent either given

current distributions exciting the material, either they are the

existing  field  in  a  distance  far  from  the  object  under

consideration.  This  means,  that  the  magnetic  field  H  in  the

neighborhood fullfils locally always 

/.B (cid:10) 0

 and 

/×Ho

(cid:10)0

.

Only,  if  the  experiment  deviates  from  the  theory,  magnetic

charges  are  probable.  This  is  the  case  for  the  ferromagnetic

hysteresis  of  iron.  If  compared  with  the  conventional  parity

tabel,  see  tab.2,  the  B-field  has  (-1)  parity  under  time

inversion, i.e. if the current is inversed, the field has to be

inversed as well. If a hysteresis exists, this is not the case,

because the hysteresis line B(H) is not unique. For a change of

parity with fields of the strenght of the coercivity, the change

in parity can easily be disproved. In this case inhomogenities

or gradients of magnetic permeability µ(x) can induce magnetic

charges. Then it holds

/.B(x) (cid:10) /.(µ(x).H(x)) (cid:10)µ(x)/.H(x) (cid:8)H(x)./µ(x) (cid:10)4(cid:140)NM g 0

Consequently,  a  magnet  can  be  modeled  as  well  using  magnetic

charges,  see  fig.4.  Any  permanent  magnetism  may  destroy  any

parity  of  a  B-field  similar  like  it  is  proved  in  original

experiments of violation of parity in beta-decay.

Of course a general B-field with no parity cannot be explained

solely by a vector potential A,

1) because B = rot A has a defined parity;

2) because B:=rot A implies div rot A = div B = 0 follows, which

is contradicting to the physical result div Bg0. 

So,  for  magnetic  charges  the  magnetic  potential  (cid:4)  has  to  be

introduced. Similar like the magnetic vector potential A it has

a more formal character, because it is not known very much about

magnetic  charges  except  of  Ehrenhaft´s  [5,  6]  and  Mikhailov´s

experiments  [37-48].  Important  questions  about  concentrating,

storing and conducting of magnetic charges are open.

realized [49], that it could not describe cases, where electric

charge  appeared,  which  were  stored  in  capacitances.  Maxwell

solved the problem by a hypothesis, which turned out to be very

useful, especially with respect to the theory of electromagnetic

waves. He changed Ampère’s equation to

the  cases  where  charges  are  generated,  for  instance  electron-

positron  pairs  in  high  energy  physics,  electron-hole  pairs  in

semiconductors, or dissociations into ions in chemistry.

Summarizing it can be said about the Maxwell equations: 

Electric and magnetic fields can be described mathematically as

general fields. Their causes are charges and currents of electric

and magnetic particles, which fullfil the continuity equation as

a constraint. Due to the mathematics the electric and magnetic

fields  can  be  decomposed  into  vortex,  potential  fields    and

Laplace fields. The charges build up the potential fields, the

currents the vortex fields and the Laplace fields adapts to the

boundary conditions.

 e) The Maxwell equations and the theory of relativity 

In the theory of relativity the Maxwell equations are formulated

in the terminology of tensors calculus. 

The  theory  of  relativity  relates  the  variables  measured  in  a

reference system to the variables of another system which moves

relatively to the first system. The transformation matrix is for

a movement in z-direction (using the definitions (cid:21):=v/c,

(cid:22) :(cid:10) 1/ 1(cid:9)(cid:21)2

)

The  4-vectors  are  invariant,  i.e.  the  length  of  a  vector  is

It  should  be  said  that  the  discussion  about  the  “correct”

equations (69) and (73) is alive until today, cf. [50].

32

It is remarkable that the derivation with monopoles yields the

same  result  as  without.  The  cause  of  this  may  be,  that  many

Maxwell  equations  are  the  solutions  from  the  the  theory  of

general  relativity,  because  one  degree  of  freedom  remains

undetermined during the derivation [8] [51, 52]. These conside-

rations were done for the shorted Maxwell equations (55), i.e.

It can be shown, that all these equation can be transformed by

If  the  parameter  (cid:23)  in  (77)  is  chosen  appropriately,  the

conventional Maxwell equations without magnetic charges are the

result. It is shown that relativistic pressure tensor (shorted

calculation  without  Lorenz  and  Rowlands  terms  !)  is  invariant

under these transformations.

If it is believed, that every electric charge is in a constant

proportion with a magnetic charge, -so the  argumentation and the

calculation of  Harrison[53] and Katz [52]- the combined charge

is  regarded  as  a  new  “elementary  charge”,  and  built  up  a

transformed (shorted) system of Maxwell equations with div B=0

33

[8, 52, 53]. So it is understandable, that Mikhailov [38, 48, 54]

tried to determine the proportion between electric and magnetic

charge, especially because the first workout of his measurements

[38] spoke against the generally accepted theoretical value of

Dirac  [55,  56].  Anyway,  in  the  light  of  these  opinions  of

Harrison[53] and Katz [52], one can ask why Mikhailov sees any

effects at all. For author the discussion is not at the end here.

Perhaps, parity checks can solve this question.

 g) boundary conditions

 stationary discontinous boundary conditions by charges

In order to derive boundary condition equation (13) is applied

on a fictive “pillbox” at the boundary between two materials of

a potential field [8], see fig.6a . 

So  one  obtains  the  relation  (with  1:=surface  charge  density)

/.FC dV(cid:10)

(78)

Equation (78) shows a relation between vector components of the

field F1 in region 1 and F2 in region 2 which both are normal to

the  surface.  This  yields  for  the    vertical  components  of

dielectric displacement DC :

i.e. at the boundary there is a discontinuity which is determined

by the surface charge density. An analog holds for the 

vertical component of the magnetic field BC :

For a electric or magnetic conducting surface holds

 stationary boundary conditions by currents

Equation (29) can be applied to derive a boundary condition if

a  surface  current  k  flows  at  the  boundary  between  regions  of

different materials, see fig.6b . So one obtains [8]

Equation (82) is a equation between the vector components F1 and

F2    which  flow  tangentially  on  the  surface  of  the  boundary

between two regions 1 and 2 of different materials.

 h) the constitutive equations of the material

The  system  of  Maxwell  equations  can  be  solved  after  the

constitutive  equation  are  known  which  describe  the  material

properties.  They  couple  the  electric  variables  (E,D)  and  the

magnetic variables (B,H)

In the most cases these couplings are simple, i.e.

or

inductivly: B (cid:10)µH

(83)

(84)

(85)

(86)

Initially the material constant were constants of proportionality

which  described  the  simple  cases.  Later  more  complicated

nonlinear  functions  were  found  which  can  generate  phase

transitions, i.e.

1 (cid:10) 1(E),

0 (cid:10)0(E),

µ (cid:10)µ(H)

After the fundamental crystal structures were known, the material

properties could be correlated to the symmetry of the crystals.

Then, the constitutive equation were described by tensors 

1 (cid:10) 1ik(E),

0 (cid:10)0ik(E),

µ (cid:10)µ ik(H)

which were first linear, then non-linear.

Then, materials were discovered whose properties were magnetic

and electric, and where an electric field influenced the magnetic

properties and vice versa [57] [58].

The theory of relativity found out that dielectric or magnetic

polarized material behaved different if it was set in motion. The

following equations are from [59]

(87)

(88)

(89)

A further complication of the constitutive relations are space-

dependence  of  the  material  properties  which  are  realized  for

instance as electronic elements.

Furthermore all material had their own dynamics in time in the

form of relaxation time.

If  all  material  properties  are  accounted  for  then  the  general

constitutive  equation  can  be  abstracted  as  a  additional

differential equation which helps to solve the whole system of

partial differential equations. This system can be written as

or

x,&,....)(x,t)
f2(E,D,H,B;T,!i,

(90)

(91)

The  variables  after  the  semicolon  show  that  the  constitutive

equations may not depend only from electromagnetic parameters,

but can depend as well from mechanic or thermodynamic material

properties.  This  means  that  the  electrodynamics  cannot  be

separated from the other areas of physics. If these the material

properties  drift  under  the  influence  of  electomagnetic  fields

then  a  purely  electrodynamic  desription  is  not  sufficient  and

further differential equations from other areas of physics have

to be included into the partial differential equation system to

be solved.

Examples: 

1)  Known  examples  are  electric  motors  and  generators.  The

describing equations of motion of the rotors are added. They are

described by the addition coordinate of the motor position.

38

2) Other systems are magnetic materials, for which the Landau-

Lifshitz-Gilbert - Gleichung [57] [60] holds

(cid:19)(cid:19)
M (cid:10) (cid:9)(cid:22).M×Heff

(cid:8)..M×(M×Heff)

(92)

which generates a system of partial differential equation (:=PDE)

if  it  is  combined  with  the  equation  of  the  magnetostatic

potential (41)  [61]. It allows to calculate magnetic domains in

ferromagnetic materials.

3) A homogeneous thermostatic system like a polymer solution is

described  by  a  free  energy  density  f.  System  plus  field  is

described by the free energy density 

. Then using the

f (cid:11)(cid:10)f (cid:8) !E

definitions  of  the  global  chemical  potential  µi*:=df*/dxi  and

xi:=volume ratio the PDE-system hold

For a magnetic system (for instance a ferrofluid solution ) the

electric variables (E,D) are replaced by magnetic ones (H,B). The

magnetic  charge density  ! is set to zero, because  no  magnetic

charges can be detected during the magnetization, see [62].

4) If the problem depends from time additionally, it is necessary

to  replace  the  second  equation  of  (93)  by  the  thermodynamic

functions for non-equilibrium. Then it is written

Z:=number of charges per ion, e:=elementary charge, E:= electric

constant, (cid:28):=mobility. The second equation of (94) is the Nernst-

Planck equation, which should coincide with the second equation

(93) for j=0. So electrochemical problems are discussed,cf. [63].

5) In semiconductors the charge densities depend from chemical

potential or quasi-Fermi level, which can be influenced by the

electric potential. A good example for such a system is a InAs-

quantum dot-doted FET invented by Yusa&Sakaki [64]. Its structure

is  shown  in  fig.7.  The  FET  can  be  used  for  storing  data  by

charging the gate capacitance. The structure of the FET is shown

in fig.7. The theoretical model of this FET stems from Rack et

al.[65].  The PDE´s of the system is:

in the 2DEG versus voltage. Remarkable is the orientation of the

electric  cycle  which  is  opposite  to  the  ferroelectric  loss

hysteresis. This suggests a “gain hysteresis”.

It is known that electric work can be changed to mechanic work

with  efficiencies  until  100%  in  the  best  electromotors.  So

electric  work  should  be  equivalent  to  mechanical  work  in  a

thermodynamical  sense.  The  present  cycle  can  be  proceeded

“isothermically” and can fulfill the energy balance only if heat

flows in from outside. Thus, the FET is a candidate for second

law violation because only heat and electricity can be exchanged.

According to own recent work [62] such cycles could be possible.

Cooling effects in semiconductors have been predicted by  [66].

These  considerations  support  the  considerations  for  the  FET

discussed above. According to [66] the FET is cooled down if it

is  set  under  voltage.  This  enforces  the  electrons  into  the

quantum dots, where they stick due to their binding energy. After

the electric discharge of the FET-capacitance the FET goes back

to the equilibrium either if the voltage is slightly inverted,

cf.fig.8a, either if the wavelength of the thermal radiation is

suffiently high to overcome the binding energy, which holds the

electrons in the quantum dots potential. So, the system can be

regarded  also  as  a  concretisation  of  Maxwell´s  demon.  The

electric energy is lended probably from the quantum dots to be

paid back after some time from the influx of environment. 

Further evidence for this idea can be found from the results of

fig. 9a-c, which show the conduction band edge (or in other words

the potential) in the FET at the beginning of the cycle, after

charging it with voltage, and after discharging the capacitance.

From the slope in the diagrams one calculates the electric fields

in the FET. If one regards the gate of the FET as a capacitance

If one reads off electric field values from the slopes in fig.

energy balance

ßW (cid:16) -(W2-W1) (cid:16) -0.00001633

The energy difference of (cid:16)1% is negative meaning that electric

energy is released by the FET after the electric cycle is closed.

The Second Law is violated by switching of the equilibrium state!

Of course, all evidence of the experiment with the Yusa-Sakaki

FET is indirectly concluded here. More decisive would be a full

balance of all electrons in the calculation or the experiment.

Herewith, the constitutive equations are characterized from the

simple  case  to  the  most  complicated  systems.  Generally,  the

description  of  a  system  may  be  very  sophisticated.  However,

normally the description is made as simple as possible.

44

3. Conclusions

It  has  been  shown  that  the  existence  of  magnetic  charges  is

justified  at  least  theoretically  especially  if  fields  of

permanent magnetism are described. 

This result suggests the following consequences to be proved: 

If magnetic charges can be separated in space - for instance in

the form of charges of polarisation in a permanent magnet - and

if this magnet moves in a circle, a magnetic current is generated

which  itself  should  generate  a  electric  field  according  to

Faraday´s law extended for magnetic charge currents. Measurement

of the electric field from moving permanent magnets can answer

the  question  whether  the  field  stems  from  currents  of  moving

magnetic  charges  or  from  the  dB/dt  -  term.  According  to  the

theory above both possibilities can be calculated.

The setup of such experiments would be similar to constructions

which  are  known  in  the  unofficial  subscene  of  physics.  J.

Searl[67-70],  D.  Hamel  [71]  and  Godin&Roschin  [72,  73]  claim,

that they have observed strong electrostatic effects using moving

permanent  magnets.  It  would  be  interesting  to  calculate  these

effects from the viewpoint of this theory.

Appendix  2:  decomposition  of  a  general  vector  field  into  a

potential field and a vortex field

Theorem 1:

Theorem 2:

F  is  a  field  with  a  defined  boundary  condition  0F  around  the

space  which  is  interesting  for  the  problem.  Divergence  and

rotation are defined according to

/×F(cid:10)j(x)

/.F (cid:10)!(x)

and the boundary condition 0F

0F: F.n (cid:10)f(r)

48

Then it holds:

according to

F can be calculated as sum of a gradient FC  of a potential, plus

rotation  of  a  vector  potential  FV  ,  plus  a  Laplace  field  FL

The solution is the Laplace field

4)  The  general  solution  is  the  sum  of    1)  -  3).  This  can  be

checked using the vector relations divrot A=0 and rotgrad -=0 .

So one obtains

F(cid:10) FC

(cid:8) FV

(cid:8)FL

q.e.d

The Laplace field is a “generalized constant of integration”. It

allows  to  adapt  to  the  boundary  conditions.  It  is  needed,  if

boundary  conditions  for  F  exist  which  are  non-zero  in  the

infinite, see fig.3.

The  divergence  term  is  changed  using  partial  integration.  One

term can be canceled during partial integration, because j(x’)=0

holds for x’= (cid:23) . So it is obtained

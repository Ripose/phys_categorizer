1. INTRODUCTION 

An  artificial  dielectric  medium  that  exhibits 

simultaneously  negative  electric  permittivity  and 

magnetic  permeability,  known  as  a  left-handed  (LH) 

material,  was  first  envisioned  by  Veselago,  who 

theoretically  predicted  that  such  a  medium  would 

exhibit  a  negative  refractive  index  (NRI)  [1].  An 

artificial  NRI  medium  exhibiting  backward-wave 

propagation  characteristics,  and  therefore  a  negative 

refractive  index,  was  first  reported  in  [2]  using  a 

unbalanced  port  and  a  balanced  port.  It  is  useful  for 

feeding two-wire antennas, where balanced currents on 

the 

two  branches  are  necessary 

to  maintain 

symmetrical 

radiation  patterns  with 

a  given 

polarization.  By  replacing  the  lumped  elements  (i.e. 

inductors  and  capacitors)  with  a  parallel  resonant 

circuit or a series resonant circuit, a lumped dual-band 

LC balun has been reported [9, 10].   

In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  dual  band  balun  by 

utilizing  the  opposite  phase  shifting  property  of  a 

standard  Composite  Right/Left  Handed 

  (CRLH) 

transmission  line  (TL)  and  a  dual  structure  of  CRLH 

(D-CRLH  for  simplicity)  TL.  It  is  formed  by  a  1x2 

(3-dB)  splitter  with  a  D-CRLH  phase-shifting  line  in 

the  top  branch  and  a  CRLH  phase-shifting  line  in  the 

bottom branch. This allows the phase responses of the 

two  branches  to  be  matched  over  a  large  frequency 

band.  This  compact  device  exhibits  excellent  return 

loss  and  transmission  characteristics  over  the  bands. 

The  performance  of  the  balun  is  verified  through 

circuit simulation.   

2. CRLH AND D-CRLH PHASE-SHIFTING LINE 

An  effectively  uniform  CRLH  and  D-CRLH 

equations 

phase-shifting  line  can  be  constructed  by  periodically 

cascading the LC unit cell shown in Fig. 1(a) and 1(b), 

respectively.

phase-shifting  line  has  an  phase  shifting  property 
opposite  to  that  of  a  standard  CRLH，with  negative 
phase shift at higher frequencies (above the stopband) 
and a positive phase shift at lower frequencies (below 
the stopband).

3. DUAL BAND BALUN 

Utilizing the opposite phase shifting property of a 

D-CRLH  and  a  CRLH,  here  we  design  a  dual-band 

balun formed by a 1x2 (3-dB) splitter with a D-CRLH 

line  in the  top branch and a CRLH line in the bottom 

branch (as shown in Fig. 3).

The simulated S parameters of the proposed balun are 

shown 

in  Fig.  5,  which 

reveals  very  good 

performances  at  2.4  GHz  and  5.0GHz.  The  insertion 

loss  (S12|  and 

|S13|) 

is  -3.03±0.05dB  at  both 

frequencies (-3 dB is the theoretical limit), and over a 

wide  band  the  difference  between  φ(S13)  and  φ(S12) 

remains either +180º or -180º (see the solid line in Fig. 

5(b)). The input return loss |S11| is well below-100dB 

from 1 to 8GHz (not shown in Fig. 5). 

Fig. 3 The proposed dual-band balun. 

The  two  central  frequencies  of  the  dual-band 

balun  are  ω1  and  ω2  (e.g.  2.4GHz  and  5GHz).  At  ω1 

and ω2, the top branch is designed to have a phase shift 

of  +90º  (+  λ/4)  and  -90º  (-λ/4),  respectively,  and  the 

bottom branch is designed to have a phase shift of -90º 

(-λ/4) and +90º (+λ/4), respectively. To match the input 

and  output 

impedances  with  a  λ/4  TL, 

the 

characteristic  impedance  of  the  D-CRLH  and  CRLH 

should satisfy (cf. Eq. (3))

5. CONCLUSION 

A  dual  structure  of  composite  right/left  handed   

(CRLH)  transmission  line  (TL)    has  been  shown  to 

have an opposite phase shifting property of a standard 

CRLH TL. Utilizing this properties, a dual-band balun 

has  been  proposed.  It  is  formed  by  a  1x2  (3-dB) 

splitter  with  a  D-CRLH  phase-shifting  line  in  the  top 

branch  and  a  CRLH  phase-shifting  line  in  the  bottom 

branch.  The  simulation  results  have  shown  that  the 

dual-band  balun  exhibits  a  quite  wide  bandwidth  of 

differential  output  phase  and  the  insertion  loss  |S12| 

and |S13| are around -3.03±0.05dB at both frequencies. 

The input return loss |S11| is well below-100dB from 1 

GHz  to  8GHz.  The  dual-band  balun  can  be  used  in   

e.g. WLAN (802.1l a/b/g) applications.

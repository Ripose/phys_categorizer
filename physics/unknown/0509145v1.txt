Abstract 

In this paper we compare the representation of the southern hemisphere midlatitude winter variability in the NCEP-

NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses. We use the classical Hayashi spectral technique, recently applied to compare the 

description of the atmospheric variability in the northern hemisphere on different spectral sub-domains as provided by 

the two reanalyses. We find relevant discrepancies in the description of the variability at different spatial and temporal 

scales. ERA40 is generally characterised by a larger variance, especially in the high frequency spectral region. In the  

southern hemisphere, also in the satellite period,  the assimilated data are relatively scarce, predominately over the 

oceans, and they provide a weaker constraint to the model dynamics. In the pre-satellite period the discrepancies 

between the two reanalyses are large and randomly distributed while after the 1979 the discrepancies are smaller but 

systematic. Moreover, a sudden jump in the VTPR period (1973-1978) is observed, mostly in the ERA40 reanalysis. 

Our result suggest some caveats in the utilization of reanalysis data  for the description of the midlatitude southern 

hemisphere variability.

1. Introduction 

 

 

Reanalysis products are designed to obtain global, homogeneous and self-consistent datasets of the 

atmospheric variables on decadal periods to study atmospheric dynamics, to validate and initialise 

GCM and to detect eventual global climate changes. Recently, the National Center for 

Environmental Prediction (NCEP), in collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric 

Research (NCAR) (Kistler et al., 2001), and the European Center for Mid-Range Weather Forecast 

(ECMWF) (Simmons and Gibson, 2000) have released re-analysed datasets for the time frames 

1948-2004 and 1957-2002, respectively. We henceforth refer to such reanalyses with the names of 

NCEP and ERA40. 

In a recent paper (Dell’Aquila et al, 2005; hereafter D05), the authors have compared the 

midlatitude variability in the NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses at different time and spatial scale for the 

overlapping period 1957-2002. D05 have used a standard space-time transformation (the Hayashi 

technique), to  discriminate the variance associated with eastward/westward propagating and 

standing waves. Integral measures of the variance have been introduced in order to characterize the 

portion of the spectrum associated with the total, standing, eastward and westward propagating 

component, and their temporal evolution. This technique provides some synthetic and global 

information about the mid latitude tropospheric waves, by furnishing a spectral measure of  their 

variance. 

By using these spectral quantities, D05 have found some discrepancies in the description of 

variability in the two reanalyses taken into account. In particular, the differences are systematic in 

the pre-satellite period and spatially distributed principally over the oceanic basins.  After the 

satellite introduction the accordance becomes closer, even if a systematic difference remains over 

the Pacific basin where ERA40 has a variance greater than one described in NCEP. In the pre-

satellite period and over the oceans, the assimilated data are scarcer and they provide a weaker 

constraint to the model dynamics. Therefore, the resulting discrepancies in the reanalysis products 

may be mainly attributed to differences in the models’  behaviour. 

The results presented in D05 form the basis for the comparison of the mid latitude Southern 

Hemisphere (hereafter SH) winter variability in the NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses which we report 

in this paper.  It is of paramount importance to assess the consistency of these reanalyses in 

representing the atmospheric variability in the SH, mainly where data are scarcer and they provide a 

weak constraint on the model behaviour. Recent works  (see among others , Sterl 2004) have 

highlighted some relevant differences in the southern hemisphere between the two reanalyses by 

3 

analysing monthly averaged variables. Our aim is to detail the comparison between different 

reanalyzed products, applying the spectral technique used in D05, and focusing on the SH mid-

latitude variability over different spatial and temporal scales.  

A spectral approach to study the SH mid-latitude variability was considered by several authors 

during 80s (Mechoso and Hartmann, 1982; Fraedrich and Kietzig, 1983; Hansen et al., 1989). The 

spectral variance reveals a predominance of short and long eastward travelling waves, while 

differences respect to the Northern Hemisphere are detected for ultra-long period fluctuations.  

The SH mid-latitude variability has some peculiar features related to the geographical distribution 

of ocean and land, and it exhibits a greater zonal symmetry  than in the Northern Hemisphere.  

During JJA, high frequency activity extends over a broader range of latitude  in relation with the 

polar jet stream, while the low frequency variability is mainly associated with the polar jet stream  

(Trenberth, 1991). The high and low frequency components can not be treated separately, but they 

strongly interact each other. Cuff and Cai (1995) have shown the existence of a symbiotic 

relationship between the high and low frequency transients in the SH. On the low frequency time-

scale (10-50 days), the preferred patterns of midlatitude variance are mainly eastward propagating 

trains, characterised by zonal wavenumber 4 and 5, the later becoming more prominent in the 

austral summer (Kidson, 99). The spatial confinement of the low frequency variance on the pacific 

ocean, observed also by Kidson, 99) can be explained by a large ensemble of high frequency 

passages, forced by tropical convection  (Redwick and rewell, 1999). This flow feature has been 

defined in the past as a SH blocking. (Tibaldi et al, 1994).  

Moreover, the most part of the detected trends related to an eventual climate change are recognized 

in the southern hemisphere (see, as example, Santer et al., 2003 JGR). So, our analysis could have a 

relevant role in the framework of atmospheric dynamics, in the climate description and also in 

studies of climate change.  

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the main differences between the 

reanalysis systems and describe the data used . In Section 3 we show the results of Hayashi spectral 

analysis for the two datasets and discuss the emerging differences. In Section 4 we compare the 

spatial distribution of the variability for the two datasets before and after the introduction of 

satellites observations. In Section 5 we summarize the results obtained and present our conclusions 

and outlook for future studies. Finally, we report in Appendix a full account of the spectral 

technique and the notation adopted.

2. Data  

We use the freely available southern hemisphere 500hPa daily geopotential height fields provided 

by the NCEP and ERA40 datasets. We consider the datasets for the overlapping time frame ranging 
from September 1st 1957 to August 31st 2002. Both reanalyses are publicly released with spatial 

resolution of 2.5° x 2.5°, with a resulting horizontal grid of 144 x 73 points. We select the June-
July-August (JJA) data relative to the latitudinal belt 30(cid:176) S-75(cid:176) S (similarly to what done in D05 for 

the NH) , where the bulk of the baroclinic and of the low frequency planetary waves activity is 

observed (Simmonds and Keay 2000; Trenberth 1991). 

The principal inhomogeneity in the assimilated data is the introduction of satellite observations 

(systematically used since 1979) which has dramatically improved the amount of data  principally 

in the southern hemisphere over the last three decades (Sturaro, 2003). The first source of satellite 

data for reanalysis is the Vertical Temperature and Pressure Radiometer (VTPR), available from 

1973 to 1978. treated in very different ways in the two assimilation systems. The inhomogeneity 

related to VTPR, already pointed out in D05, could be more relevant in the southern hemisphere  

for the lack of other data sources. Moreover, in the Southern region there are well known processing 

errors in the reanalyses assimilation, as the misplacing of PAOBS data in NCEP (Kistler et al 2001) 

for the period 1979-1992. Studies at the Climate Prediction Center into the sensitivity of the NCEP 

reanalysis to the misplaced PAOBS indicate that the largest differences for wintertime synoptic-

scale features are seen poleward of 40°S over the oceans in the winter months, and decrease rapidly 

with height. Analyses of synoptic-scale features south of 40°S in 1979-1992 could be affected by 

the addition of an error that has a magnitude comparable to the basic uncertainty of the analyses. 

(Kistler et al 2001, Simmonds and Keay 2000)  

In order to provide a rough estimate of this  bug , we have also taken into account the NCEP-DOE 

AMIP II reanalysis (hereafter NCEP2) that fixes this mistake and several previous processing errors 

present in NCEP (see Kanamitsu 2002, where a detailed description of  NCEP2 is reported). 

NCEP2 has been released for the time frames 1979-2002. NCEP2 should not be considered as a 

different reanalysis, but should be regarded as an updated and human error–fixed version of NCEP. 

The physical parameterisations are the same used in NCEP, with the same spatial and temporal 

resolution, and the satellite data are treated in the same way.  

For a  more detailed description of the reanalysis systems we refer to Sec. 2a of D05.

multiplying the power spectra by  mj (cid:215).

, in order to compensate for the non-constant density of 

points in a log-log plot (see Appendix A for notation and more details). 

We underline that the Hayashi spectra computed using this definition result to be expressed in units 

of 

2m  as done by Blackmon [1976] and  Speranza [1983]  and must be multiplied times a factor  

1/8*86400s to be comparable with what shown in D05 (where the spectra were expressed in 

sm /2

).   

The lobes of westward propagating components (reported in Fig. 1b-d) are less intense and bounded 

on the planetary scale (zonal wavenumbers 2-3, periods longer than 20 days), as expected in a 

region with a large scale topography present but small. 

The variability is essentially explained by the eastward propagating component, that is more active 

than the corresponding one in the northern hemisphere (see Fig. 1c in D05) and also characterises 

the planetary spatial and long time scale (k=4 and period around 15 days), as illustrated in Fig. 1c. 

Note in particular that the amplitude of the variability associated to k=4 is double with respect to 

corresponding one in the NH. This component mostly coincides with the total variance shown in 

Fig.1a and could be related with the blocking episodes (Renwick and Revell, 1999). The standing 

variance is essentially comparable with that observed in the Northern hemisphere. From this feature 

we can also hypothesise that in the large–scale circulation the topography is more relevant for the 

travelling waves than for the standing ones. These results are in good agreement with the past 

6 

analyses performed along the same lines but using shorter datasets (Fraedrich and Kietzig, 1983; 

Hansen et al.1989).  

Following D05 we analyse the difference between the description of the climatological variance of 

the two reanalyses obtained by using the Hayashi technique. In Fig. 2 we report the difference in the 

climatological spectra of eastward propagating component between ERA40 and NCEP. As clearly 

shown in this Figure, ERA40 dramatically overestimate the variance relative to eastward 

propagating component of the wavy field. The observed discrepancy corresponds to more of  25% 

of the signal. The other components do not show any relevant difference. The discrepancies are 

most evident for zonal wave number k=5 and for a period of about 7 days, in the spectral region of 

baroclinic disturbances. It is quite impressive to observe the amount of this difference that points 

out that the Climatologies of the winter atmospheric variability in the southern hemisphere of the 

two datasets are almost different. Let us also note that these differences in the southern hemisphere 

variability are quite greater than the corresponding in the northern one.  Finally, we compare with 

the climatological averages of ERA40 also those obtained by NCEP2 for the overlapping period 

(1979-2002) and we obtain almost the same result (here not shown). 

3b. Interannual variability  

Following D05, we inspect the temporal behaviour of the previously observed discrepancies by 

using introduce the following integral quantities 

 that represent the portion of variance 

(
Wn
jE

)

associated to specific spectral subdomains W

 . In Appendix B we report the definition of the integral 

quantities and a review of this methodology. We underline that the quantities

 considered in 

(
Wn

tE

)

this paper are conveniently expressed in unit of 

2m  and must be multiplied by a conversion factor 

to be comparable with the values presented in D05. 

In the first two columns of Table 1 we report the time average

 for the two reanalyses, 

(

jE

)

computed over the whole wavenumber and frequency domain for the overlapping period 1957-

2002. As in D05, we estimate the standard error of the time-averaged value with the interannual 

variability of the signal:

averaging process, since winters are statistically independent from each other. Most of the variance 

is due to the eastward propagating component, as can be inferred also from Fig. 1. The time-average 

of the ERA40 signal is considerably  larger and the discrepancies between the averaged values for

NCEP and ERA40 largely exceed the error bar related to the standard error 

, specially for the

eastward propagating waves.  

Inspection of the differences in 

 for the total, standing and eastward/westward propagating 

(

)

components (Fig. 3), reveals a bias of ERA40 towards larger 

 in the period 1958-1972, with 

(
Wn
jE

)

a principal contribution from the eastward propagating component..  However, in this period the 

signal-to-noise ratio for the discrepancies between the two reanalyses is small. Moreover, in the 

standing and westward propagating component there is no clear shift. There is an sudden jump in 

1973 when the propagating eastward variance observed in ERA40 abruptly decreases with respect 

to NCEP. Another abrupt jump can be observed in 1978. Afterwards, ERA40 exhibits a systematic 

larger variance.  This result does not change if we consider a different latitudinal belt (30S-50S or 

50S-70S, here not shown). 

The abrupt change in the description of the variability correspond to the use of VTPR data (as 

largely discussed in D05). This result suggests that the different use of satellite data ( NCEP system 

assimilates retrieved profiles of temperature and humidity, ERA40 assimilates directly satellite 

radiance) corresponds to a very different capability in describing atmospheric variability, 

principally the travelling disturbances. This effect is particularly evident in the southern hemisphere 

where a weaker constraint on the models is provided by the sparse land-based vertical soundings 

available. 

In order to compare data which are derived homogeneously, we have decided to skip the VTPR 

period 1973-1978 when we observe a very different feature with respect the previous and the 

following period. We exhibit in Table 1 averaged values 

 for  the pre-satellite period (1958-

(

jE

)

1972) and for 1979-2002. For both periods the ERA40 mean values are clearly larger than for 

NCEP with differences significantly greater  than the corresponding standard error 

.  We can 

(W

jE

)

also note an abrupt change in 

 between the first and the second period in ERA40, as already 

(

ETE ,

pointed out by Bengtsson at al 2003 who analysed different climatological variables. In NCEP the 

time averaged values seem to be more homogeneous. Nevertheless, a trend in the measure of 

variance is also recognizable by an inspection of time averages above the two periods, as also noted  

by  Renwick and Revell (1999) 

To analyse the effects of the  bugs corrected in NCEP on the description of the midlatitude 

variability, we  compare also  the differences in 

 for NCEP and NCEP2 for the overlapping 

(

)

period 1979-2002  As shown in Fig. 4, the discrepancies between the two releases of the NCEP-

NCAR reanalysis are one order magnitude smaller than the ones found between NCEP and ERA40.

However, these differences are comparable with the ones relative to the northern hemisphere 

between NCEP and ERA40 (D05)  and they are not negligible. In particular, the discrepancies are 

more pronounced in the first years, when NCEP data are affected by the well known PAOBS bugs 

and every component  

equally contribute to the total difference. So, we have estimated that 

(
Wn
jE

)

the known bugs in the NCEP reanalysis have a minor role in the observed discrepancy between the 

two reanalyses in exam.  
Following D05, in Table 2 we propose the clear-cut division of different spectral sub-domains  W

 

into four categories, on the basis of the results reported in Fig. 1a-d. This partition  can help 

identifying discrepancies in the capability of the two reanalyses in describing phenomena occurring 

on a given spatial and temporal scale and pertaining to different physical processes. As well as in 

the Northern hemisphere, also in the austral winter most of the variance has to be attributed to the 

Low Frequency- Low Wavenumber (LFLW) and High Frequency High Wavenumber (HFHW) 

waves (values not shown). However, the division is slightly different by the one adopted for the 

northern hemisphere for the dissimilar spectral properties of the ultra long  and synoptic waves in 

the southern region. 

In Fig. 5a-b we plot the time series of the difference between the integrals  

 computed over 

(
Wn
jE

)

the subdomains LFLW and HFHW, for the two reanalyses. The behaviour exhibited in Fig. 3 is 

substantially confirmed. For the discrepancies in LFLW (Fig. 5a) the signal-to-noise ratio is small 

in the pre-satellite period. Let us also note that ERA40 has, on average, a lesser standing variance 

than NCEP. Then, after a sudden jump in the VTPR period, the differences become systematic. In 

the HFHW spectral subdomain (Fig. 5b)  the discrepancies seem to be noisy in the earlier period but 

ERA40 has systematically more variance than NCEP. After the 1979 the noise-to-signal ratio 

becomes greater and the differences are almost constant. 

4. Spatial distribution of variability before 1973  and after 1979 

In Section 3 we have examined the discrepancies emerging from a synthetic description of the 

activity of planetary and synoptic waves.  In Fig. 3, a sudden shift in the systematic bias was 

observed in 1973 corresponding to the first introduction of VTPR data.  A second shift is apparent 

in the late 1970s when standard satellite observations began to be regularly employed. After the 

introduction of the satellite data the discrepancy is systematic and ERA40 shows a larger variance. 

We now proceed by analysing the spatial distribution of the differences between NCEP and ERA40. 

 

 

 

9 

In Fig. 5a-d we map the low frequency (LF) variability of  NCEP for the periods 1958-72 (Fig. 6a) 

and 1979-2002 (Fig. 6b), and the corresponding differences with the same data for the ERA40 

reanalysis (Fig. 6c-6d, respectively). The LF atmospheric variability is obtained by discarding the 

frequencies

(see also Table 2) in a Fourier transform of the 500hPa geopotential 

height. The two maps of the NCEP variance show that the LF atmospheric variability appears more 

symmetric than the corresponding northern one. However, two maxima over the Pacific and Indian 

basins are well defined. Over there regions the major discrepancies between the two reanalyses 

occur. In particular, before the 1973 (Fig. 6a)  an East-West dipole structure is evident over the 

pacific region. This suggests a different location of the LF variability maximum, as reproduced in 

NCEP and ERA40. A similar pattern, but with axes North-South oriented, is present also over the 

Atlantic basin. In the Indian sector ERA40 overestimate the LF variance with respect to NCEP. In 

the south of Australia the differences are almost comparable with the signal itself.  After 1979, 

ERA40 has systematically more variance than NCEP, especially over south Pacific region.  

The spatial pattern of the high frequency (HF) variability (

, as in Table 

2) is reported in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7a-b is reported the well known pattern of the southern storm track 

characterised by a greater zonal symmetry than the northern one and  that remains near 50°S mainly 

over the Indian Ocean.  (Trenberth 1991). As reported in Fig. 7c-d, in both periods, ERA40 has 

more HF variability on the entire southern mid-latitude band; the relative differences are of the 

order of 30%, with peaks of about 40% over the Indian Ocean, in the southern hemisphere storm 

track region.  However, unlikely observed in Fig. 6 for the LF, in the HF region the introduction of 

the satellite do not drastically modify the discrepancies observed in the two reanalyses 

 

 

5. Discussion and conclusions 

In this paper the NCEP and ERA40 reanalyses have been compared for the overlapping period 

1957-2002. Differences in the description of the southern hemisphere winter variability have been 

quantitatively estimated by employing the space-time Fourier decomposition introduced by Hayashi 

(1971; 1979), recently re-discussed in D05. 

We have found a systematic difference in the description of variability in the two reanalyses for the 

period 1957-72.On average, ERA40 is characterised by a variance larger than NCEP, mainly in the 

region of the eastward propagating long (k=4, period=15d) and synoptic waves (k=5; period=7d).  

Additionally, by using ad hoc integral measures, we have inspected the temporal behaviour of the 

discrepancies in describing the southern hemisphere variability in the two reanalyses. We have 

10 

-

-

£
found an abrupt jump in the differences in the period corresponding to the introduction of VTPR 

data (1973-1978) and a systematic bias in the satellite period. The differences revealed are about 

30% of the signal. In particular we find a sudden jump in the ERA40 variability in the 70s (see also 

Bengtsson 2004) 

Then, we focused on two main spectral sub-domains (HFHW and LFLW), as in D05, which are in a 

strong “symbiotic” relationship  in the southern hemisphere (Cai and Mak, 1990) because a more 

effective forcing of mid-latitude LF variability by HF. In the LF region there are randomly 

discrepancies in the pre-satellite period, where, after 1979, the discrepancies are systematic. On the 

other hand, ERA40 is always characterised by a larger HF variance, focused on the southern storm 

track region.  No better accordance with ERA40 has been found used NCEP2 data, where some 

known bugs present in NCEP have been fixed. 

From these results some conclusion can be pointed out that in the pre-satellite a weaker constraint 

on the models is provided by the sparse land-based vertical soundings available not sufficient  to 

constraint the models to a similar behaviour. However, even after the introduction of satellite data 

in the assimilation systems, the different treatment of these data leads to a different representation 

of variability as observed also in the Northern Hemisphere for the Pacific sector (D05, Branckovic 

and Molteni, 2004). However, in some southern regions only satellite data are available and  they 

are not enough to costrain the models to a similar representation of the atmospheric variability.  

Some caveat could be introduced regarding to what asserted by Kidson (1999) about the period 

1970-73 when a different behaviour of LF variability is observed. During this period different data 

and different assimilation methods have been used in the assimilation systems. Thus, a caution 

should be used for direct comparison of atmospheric fields in different periods. Moreover, several 

recent work (among others, Santer et al 2003) revealed some decadal changes in monthly averages 

data from reanalyses in the southern hemisphere. These trends could be influenced by the major 

changes in the observing system which occurred in 70s (see also Bengtsson et al 2004). 

The differences observed around the wave number 4 can be ascribed to SH  blocking episodes 

(Renwick and Revell, 1999), and in turn related to a different representation of the tropical forcing 

in the two reanalyses. This discrepancy is probably due to a well known differences in the  

representation of tropical OLR, in particular over the deadline.  

Finally, we wish to emphasize  that this work (likely D05)  could be considered also as a 

preliminary test for methodologies and diagnostics tools to be employed for the intercomparison of 

simulations such as those provided in the  broader context of  Program for Climate Model 

Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI), sponsored by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 

Change Assessment Report 4 (IPCC-AR4).

APPENDIX A 

The space-time spectral analysis, introduced by Hayashi (1971), provides information about the 

direction or speed at which the eddies move. This information may be obtained by firstly Fourier-

analysing the spatial field, and then computing the time-power spectrum of each spatial Fourier 

component. The difficulty here lies in the fact that straightforward space-time decomposition will 

not distinguish between standing and travelling waves: a standing wave will give two spectral peaks 

corresponding to travelling waves moving eastward and westward at the same speed and with the 

same phase. The problem can only be circumvented by making assumptions regarding the nature of 

the wave. For instance, we may assume complete coherence between the eastward and westward 

components of standing waves and attribute the incoherent part of the spectrum to real travelling 

waves (Pratt 1976; Fraedrich and Bottger 1978; Hayashi 1979).

We emphasize that for sake of simplicity of the notation, we have neglected the indication of the 

winter under investigation, denoted in the text by the superscript n.  We emphasize that customarily, 

Hayashi spectra are generally represented by plotting the quantities

, as reported in Fig. 1a-1d, in order for 

equal geometrical areas in the log-log plot to represent equal variance. With this definition, the 

Hayashi spectra presented in this paper are expressed in unit of  

2m  and can compared to those 

given in D05 after a multiplication by  1/8*86400s  

 

 

APPENDIX B 

It possible to go beyond the comparison of climatological averages of the Hayashi spectra by 

inspecting the temporal behaviour of the previously described discrepancies in specific spectral 

subdomains. We introduce the following integral quantities:

known instability of the Fourier analysis in describing small scale spectral features. The

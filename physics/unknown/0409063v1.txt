Abstract: 
The Basic Ecological Observatory (BEO) Moussala is located at 2925m above sea level and 
one  of  the  main  activities  is  connected  with  gamma  background  and  neutron  dose  rate 
monitoring. 
The neutron and gamma  measurements  are carried out with help of site radiation monitor 
Harwell Type 3208 -1. The dose rate of ambient gamma background is measured with SBN-
90, improved with the embedded microprocessor system using automatic PC based system. A 
cross check and inter calibration with existing TLD (thermo luminescent dosimeters) at BEO 
Moussala which is a part of the monitoring network of INRNE is presented. A polyethylene 
sphere with a layer of lead serving as a neutron breeder, extending the energy range from 
about  40  MeV  to  several  hundred  MeV  is  presented  as  a  project  in  development.  Another 
project in development is the construction of active detector based on SNM -15 detectors for a 
dose  rate  measurement  of  cosmic  neutrons  is  described.  Preliminary  study  of  the 
performances of the detectors are carried out. A further project for muonic telescope similar 
to the yet developed is discussed. 
 
1.Intoduction 
The location of BEO Moussala is on the top of the highest mountain at Balkan peninsula. This 
is one of the most proper  places  in the region of Balkans  and gives excellent possibility for  
high-mountain monitoring i.e. possibilities for measurements, experiments and monitoring for 
changes  and  processes  at  the  atmosphere,  pollution,  air-transport,  aerosol  investigations, 
changes  of  gamma-background,  dose-rate  from  neutron  flux,  cosmic  ray  investigations 
(Stamenov,  Vachev  2003)   etc…  At  the  same  time  the  analyses  of  collected  data  gives 
information about relation between very different kind of parameters and factors.  
All  the  data  are  transmitted  from  BEO  to  INRNE  trough  Internet  using  the  communication 
system developed system at the top  (Ivanov et al. 2002a).  The  communication  system  gives 
the possibility to obtain information in quasi real time. 
One  of  the  most  important  measurements  carried  out  at  BEO  Moussala  are  the  radiation 
measurements  precisely  the  gamma  background  and  the  obtained  dose  rate  from  neutrons. 
The observed radiation background at the top is superposition of radiation due to the specifics 
of the top such as soils, roc ks etc…. The other contribution is due to the secondary cosmic ray 
radiation.  In  this  paper  we  present  the  recent  radiation  measurement  carried  out  at  BEO 
Moussala and discuss the further improvements.  

 

 

 

2.Quasi real-time Radioactivity Background Monitoring 
The quasi real-time radioactivity background monitoring includes measurements for dose-rate 
of  gamma  and  neutron  flux.  The  gamma  background  monitoring  is  carried  out  by  two 
different  independent  devices  – SBN-90  and  Harwell  3208-1.  The  Harwell  3208-1  provides 
also measurement of neutron flux. Both devices are connected with personal computers (PC), 
which  give  the  possibility  for  full  automatisation  of  the  measurements.  Additional 
measurement  of  the  gamma  background  is carried out using  thermo  luminescent  dosimeters  
(TLD) detector. 
 
1.1Gamma background real-time monitoring 
The gamma background monitoring at BEO Moussala  has been started  in 2000. The French 
Electrical  Company  (EDF)  consigned  to  INRNE  four  devices  SBN-90  in  1994.  One  of  the 
devices was based on top Moussala and the others are placed in different referent points  – two 
are at INRNE, and one at Radioactive Waste Repository at Novi Khan. Several improvements 
are  proposed  and  realized  at  INRNE.  The  original  output  of  the  device  was  changed  with 
numerical  output  with  help  of   the  ADC  developed  at  INRNE.  At  the  same  time  software, 
which  permits  to  manage the readout and data acquisition system  is  deve loped. This  permits 
to  collect  the  data  at  PC  and  to  organize  them  in  databank.  The  connection  and  the  
management  of  the  device  with  PC  and  taking  into  account  the  existence  of  the 
communication system  in BEO Moussala gives the possibility for a quasi real time to obtain 
information  about  the  gamma  background  at  the  top.  In  2002  CERN  consigned  to  INRNE 
another one  different  type  device –  Harwell  3208-1  site  radiation  monitor  which  has  been 
working on top Moussala since September 2002.  
SBN-90  is  based  on  scintillation  detector  of  NaI(T).  In  this  devices  has  been  integrated 
microcontroller  PIC16C77  and  upgraded  with  new  electronic  block  for  amplification, 
reception  and  automatic  recording  the  data  from  measurements  (Stamenov  et  al.  2001).  A 
method for calibration of the device was proposed and carried in the INRNE (Stamenov et al. 
2001). 
The average month dose-rate from gamma background on top Moussala for 2003 is shown on 
fig.1a.  The  minimal  dose-rate  is  87.50  nSv/h  (May  2003)  and  the  maximal  is  128.10  nSv/h 
(July 2003). The floating of values  and their fluctuations  depends from rains. The measured 
dose-rate  increases in months with intensive rains, because the rains  collect the aerosols from 
higher level of the atmosphere and transport them to the ground-level. In the beginning of rain 
the dose-rate goes up and after that slowly decries. The recent results of the measurements are 
presented in fig. 1b, actually the obtained dose rate for mounth of August 2004. Comparing to 
the average dose-rate in Sofia as was expected the dose rate at the top is higher. In one this is 
due to the some specifics of BEO Moussala, the type of soils and roc ks which are with Ra. On 
the  other  hand  taking  into  account  tha t the BEO Moussala is at about 3000m  above  the  sea 
level  the  contribution  of  secondary  cosmic  ray  radiation  to  the  total  gamma  background  is 
most important com paring to seal level.  
The Site Radiation Monitor Harwell Type 3208-1  is  low -level combined gamma and neutron 
radiation  monitor.  It  ha s  been  designed  to  meet  radiological  protection  requirements  at  the 
400  GeV  Proton  Synchrotron  at  CERN,  Lab.  II  Geneva.  The  monitor  is  constructed  in 
environmental cases for outdoor usage and the design contains a total dose integration system 
capable  of  running  for  long  periods except for  routine  battery  replacements.  The  operation 
principle  is  as  follows:  after  detection  of  each  increment  of  integrated  dose  a  pulse  is 
produced  by  the  electronic  circuits.  Afterwards  the  pulses  are  counted  be  a  mechanical 
register. The gamma radiation measurement is carried out with help of  argon filled  ionisation 
chamber. The monitor provides pulse output after the accumulation of 50 nSv/h dosage. The 

 

 

device  is  connected  to  PC  and  registration  of  pulses  into  file  is  controlled  by  software 
developed by BEO-group (Ivanov et al. 2001b). The output pulse-signal is reduced to TTL.

The average dose rate measured by Harwell 3208-1 is 137.40 nSv/h (fig.2).  Actually there are 
not  systematical  differences  between  values  measured  by  SBN-90  and  Harwell  3208-1. The 
differences are result of different sensitivity of devices and different kind of detectors.

A TLD detector was also developed (Guelev et al. 1994). CaSO4:Dy – based TL dosimeter 
were  developed  and  began  use  in  Bulgaria  during  the  1980’s.  The  dosimeter  passed  the 
requirements  of  IEC  Standard  1066  in  the  early  1990’s.  Energy  response  of  the  dosimeter 
TLE-4,  obtained  using  different  linear  combinations  of  detector  response  under  tin  and 
polyethylene filters: Sn – energy response of CaSO4:Dy detector placed in a 2 mm tin sphere; 
Pe -  energy  response  of  CaSO4:Dy  detector  placed  in  a  0.5  mm  polyethylene  holder.  The 
energy  and angular response  responses  of  the  TLD  are  presented  at  fig.  3a and fig.  3b. The 
experiment results are compared with  Monte Carlo  simulation (Isabey  et  al.  1997) carried  out 
with EGS4  (Nelson et al. 1985)  code. The  annual  average  of  the  obtained  dose-rate  with  the 
TLD for the same period as mentioned above is 160 nSv/h.

In  all  cases  of  measured  gamma  background  there are not  observed  systematic errors. The 
differences are due essent ially to the different sensitivity, energy range and  methodology  for 
dose-rate estimation. 
 
1.2 Neutron flux measurements 
The neutron flux on top Moussala has been measur ing  by  Harwell  3208-1. The device use a 
proportional  counter  and  Anderson-Braun  moderator.  The  pulses  from  the  counter  are 
amplified and a trigger a pulse amplitude dis criminator give a pulse output. The output pulses 
are  counted  in  the  neutron  register  and  also  added  to  the  ionisation  chamber  pulses.  The 
average month values for neutrons for 2003 is shown on fig.4a. The  average annual  dose-rate 
from neutron flux  is  40.50  nSv/h.  As example  in fig. 4b  are  presented also the recent results 
for August 2004.

In a full analogy of the previous section  the obta ined dose-rate comparing  to measurement at 
INRNE campus (500m above sea level) with the same device is bigger. This  is due essentially 
to secondary cosmic ray radiation contribution.  
 
3 Future projects and plans  
One  of  the  future  projects  yet  in  development  is  a  neutron  detector  for  absolute  secondary 
cosmic  neutron  flux  measurements.  That  kind  of  monitor  will  give  good  possibilities  for 
analyzing  the  dose-rate  of  secondary  neutron  flux  and  average  energy  of  integral  spectra  on 
secondary  neutrons  also.  It  will  be  based  on  Russian  gas  detectors  filled  with  BF3  of  type 
SNM-15.  The  detectors  will  be  situated  under  the  roof  of  the  building  of  BEO Moussala. On 
fig.  5  is  shown  the  possible  configuration  and  designs  of  the  monitor  for  measurement  of 
absolute  neutron  flux  –  group  of  6  of  detectors  will  be  covered  with  polyethylene.  The 

 

 

expected  frequency  of  counting  is  200  imp/sec  for  neutrons  with  energy  from  1  MeV  to  10 
MeV.

This detector configuration is without lead i.e. without neutron multiplicator. This is the main 
difference comparing to the usual neutron monitors. Thus the principle aim of this device is 
the  measurement  of  the  absolute  neutron  flux  of  secondary  cosmic  ray  radiation.  It  is  clear 
that  the  precise  Monte  Carlo  modeling  of  the  detector  response  is  needed,  the  aim  being  to 
estimate precisely the expected dose-rate.   
A preliminary experimental study  of the detector efficiency using neutron flux is carried out.

Development  of  device  for  automatic  real-time  monitoring  of  absolute  neutron  flux  will 
provide analyzes for secondary neutron flux, measurement of the dose-rate for aircraft crews 
and calibration of new detectors and devices (F. Spurny  , I. Votoekova,  1993). 

 

 

 

Under  development  in  INRNE  is  a  polyethylene  sphere  with  a  layer  of  lead  serving  as  a 
neutron breede r, extending the energy range from about 40 MeV to several hundred MeV. We 
are also planning the construction of an active device, in which in the center of the sphere is 
placed a photodiode in contact with a 10B layer.  
Importantt  project  in  development  is  the  commissioning  of  muon  telescope  based  on  water 
Cherenkov  detectors.  Such  kind  of  device  is  similar  to  the  yet  builded  one in  South  West 
University  Neofit  Rilski  in  Blagoevgrad Bulgaria  (E.  Malamova  et  al.   2001).  The  aim  is 
measuring  the  muonic  component  of  the  secondary  cosmic  ray  and  afterwards  searching 
correlation  with  other  measurements  as  example  weather  changes,  cloud  cover  and 
thunderstorms, in other words space weather. 
 
4. Summary 
We  presented  the  gamma  background  measurements  carried  out  at  BEO  Moussala.  The 
gamma  background  dose-rate  is  obtained  using  different  devices  and  methods.  The 
differences of the obtained values are due essentially to the different sensitivity and range of 
the  devices.  The  further  development  of  active  detector  for  neutron  flux  detection  and 
afterwards the calculation of the dose rate obtained by cosmic ray neutrons will complete the 
radiation measurements at BEO Moussala as the development of the muonic telescope.

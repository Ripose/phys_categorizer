The  output  variables  (time  series)  from  physical  systems  often  exhibit  complex 

fluctuations  containing  information  about  the  underlying  dynamics.  An  important 

problem in the study of a time series is determining whether the time series arises from a 

stochastic  process  or  has  a  deterministic  component  that  is  generated  from  chaotic 

dynamics  having  finite  number  of  degrees  of  freedom.  Whether  a  time  series  has  a 

deterministic  component  or  not  in  turn  dictates  what  approaches  are  appropriate  for 

investigating  the  time  series  and  its  generating  process.  In  this  sense  detecting  the 

determinism in a time series is very important. 

Several methods of nonlinear dynamical analysis have previously been developed 

to detect determinism in time series [1-3]. These methods are all based on the assumption 

that a trajectory in the state space reconstructed from a deterministic time series behaves 

similarly to nearby trajectories as time evolves. Hence, a large number of data points are 

required to have sufficient information of the nearby trajectories to compare their future 

behaviors. In addition, the application of these methods can lead to spurious results for 

nonstationary time series.  

Recently  Costa  et  al.  [4]  introduced  a  new  method,  Multiscale  Entropy  (MSE) 

analysis for measuring the complexity of finite length time series. In this paper we show 

that the MSE method can be used to detect the determinism in a time series. The MSE 

method  measures  complexity  taking  into  account  the  multiple  time  scales.  This 

computational tool can be quite effectively used to quantify the complexity of a natural 

time  series.  The  MSE  method  uses  Sample  Entropy  (SampEn)  [5]  to  quantify  the 

regularity of finite length time series. SampEn is largely independent of the time series 

length  when  the  total  number  of  data  points  is  larger  than  approximately  750  [5].

Recently  MSE  has  been  successfully  applied  to  quantify  the  complexity  of  many 

Physiologic and Biological signals [6, 7].  

The  MSE  method  is  based  on  the  evaluation  of  SampEn  on  the  multiple  scales. 

The  prescription  of  the  MSE  analysis  is:  given  a  one-dimensional  discrete  time  series, 

{x1,.....,xi,....,xN}, construct the consecutive coarse-grained time series, {

})(τy

, determined 

by the scale factor, τ, according to the equation:

where τrepresents the scale factor and

Nj ≤≤

τ/

. The length of each coarse-grained 

time series is  τ/N

. For scale one, the coarse-grained time series is simply the original 

time series. Next we calculate the SampEn for each scale using the following method. Let

  be  vectors  of  length  m.  Let  nim(r)  represent  the 

number of vectors um(j) within distance r of um(i), where j ranges from 1 to (N-m) and j≠i 

to exclude the self matches.

Advantage of SampEn is that it is less dependent on time series length and is relatively 

consistent over broad range of possible r, m and N values. We have calculated SampEn 

for all the studied data sets with the parameters m=2 and r= 0.15äSD (SD is the standard 

deviation of the original time series). 

Costa et al. had tested the MSE method on simulated white and 1/f noises [4]. They 

have shown that for the scale one, the value of entropy is higher for the white noise time 

series in comparison to the 1/f noise. This may apparently lead to the conclusion that the 

inherent complexity is more in the white noise in comparison to the 1/f noise. However, 

the application of the MSE method shows that the value of the entropy for the 1/f noise 

remains almost invariant for all the scales while the value of entropy for the white noise 

time series monotonically decreases and for scales greater than 5, it becomes smaller than 

the corresponding values for the 1/f noise. This result explains the fact that the 1/f noise 

contains complex structures across multiple scales in contrast to the white noise. With a 

view to understand the complexity of deterministic chaotic data we have applied the MSE 

method to the following synthetic chaotic data sets.

The result of the MSE analysis on the chaotic data sets together with the white noise, 

fractional Brownian noise (with Hurst exponent 0.7) [8] and the 1/f noise is shown in Fig. 

1. It is seen that the entropy measure for the deterministic chaotic time series increases on 

small scales and then gradually decreases indicating the reduction of complexity on the 

larger  scales.  This  trend  of  the  variation  of  the  SampEn  with  scale  is  entirely  different 

5

from  the  white  noise,  fractional  Brownian  noise  and  the  1/f  noise  [4].  Moreover,  the 

variation  of  the  SampEn  for  all  chaotic  data  sets  showed  a  similar  behavior.  This 

establishes the fact that the MSE analysis can be used to detect the determinism in a time 

series. 

In conclusion we have showed that the Sample  Entropy  is  an  important  statistic 

for detecting determinism in a time series.

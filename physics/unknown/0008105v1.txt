Recent 

in 

ion  source  developments  resulted 

the 
generation  of  high  brilliance,  high  current  beams  of 
protons and light ions. After extraction and transport the 
beams with large internal space charge forces have to be 
captured,  bunched  and  preaccelerated  for  the  injection 
into the following driver part of a new generation of high 
intensity  beam  facilities  for  neutron  sources,  energy 
production, transmutation e.g. A combination of RFQ and 
DTL is considered to be a good solution for such a high 
current  ion  injector.  Some  preliminary  beam  dynamics 
layouts  have  been  investigated  by  multiparticle  simu-
lations.  Basic  parameters  like  frequency,  ion  energy  and 
sparking  have  been  varied  for  the  International  Fusion 
Material  Irradiation  Facility  (IFMIF)  scenario  as  an 
example. The main interest was directed to high transmis-
sion,  low  losses  and  emittance  conservation.  The  beam 
matching  to  the  RFQ  is  shortly  discussed  as  well  as  the 
matching between RFQ and DTL. 

1  INTRODUCTION 

During the last years the feasibility of a new generation of 
high  intensity  ion  accelerator  facilities  has  been  studied. 
They consist of an rf linac, in some cases followed by rings 
for  postacceleration,  beam  accumulation  or  pulse 
compression.  Well  known  examples  are  drivers  for  spal-
lation  neutron  sources,  transmutation  of  radioactive  waste, 
energy  amplifier  e.g.  A  smaller  scale  project  is  a  material 
test machine (IFMIF) [1]. In all proposed schemes the linac 
starts  with  high  current  ion  sources  followed  by  RFQ 
accelerators  and  drift  tube  linacs  as  initial  part,  in  high 
energy beam facilities coupled cavity linacs or synchrotrons 
take over for further acceleration. The requested beam peak 
currents are in the range of some 10 mA to more than 100 
mA  of  light  and  heavy  ions.  A  high  quality  of  the  beam 
formation  in  the  injector  part  is  essential  for  the  whole 
complex,  because  small  emittances  and  well  confined 
bunches are needed to avoid losses and activation along the 
accelerator. One critical aspect is the matching of the beam 
between  the  different  parts  of  the  driver,  which  will  be 
discussed in the following for IFMIF. 

2  THE IFMIF INJECTOR PART

between  16  and  20  MeV/u  are  used  to  produce  very  high 
fluxes of neutrons for testing the wall materials for magnetic 
fusion reactors.  

Figure 1: Basic layout of the IFMIF facility. 

While in high energy machines the required high beam 
current  at  the  injector  end  is  generated  by  combining 
beams from 2 or more ion sources in funnelling steps, in 
the IFMIF case 2 to 4 accelerators in parallel are planned 
due to its comparatively small size. Each of them has to 
capture,  focus  and  accelerate  a  beam  of  125  mA  in  cw 
operation. Beam losses must be kept as small as possible 
to  avoid  activation,  which  becomes  serious  for  beam 
energies  higher  than  1.0  MeV/u.  A  base  line  design  has 
been worked out for the accelerator, parameters are listed 
in Table 1 [1].

A  first  beam  dynamics  layout  of  the  RFQ  employing 
equipartitioning  rules  has  been  carried  out  successfully 
already in 1996 [2]. Also a design of a DTL for 4 MeV/u 
was  made.  Recently  two  parameters  of  this  base  line 
design have been reconsidered:  

1)  The  electrode  voltage  assumed  for  the  RFQ  was 
rather  high:  applying  the  Kilpatrick  criterion  for  rf 
breakdown in the form ,

a  Kilpatrick  factor  of  2.1  came  out,  which  is  reasonable 
for  pulsed  operation  but  considered  as  too  high  for  cw 
operation of a structure. Therefore new designs have been 
attempted with a lower value of 1.7 Kilpatrick. 

2)  The  RFQ  is  highly  efficient  in  capturing  and 
focusing high intensity beams, but the acceleration rate is 
rather  low.  Therefore  the  end  energy  of  the  RFQ  of  4 
MeV/u should be lowered to 2.5 MeV/u. 

3  BEAM DYNAMICS LAYOUT OF RFQ 

AND DTL AT 175 MHZ 

In the baseline design the RFQ has to accelerate a 125 
mA  Deuteron  beam  from  50  keV/u  to  4  MeV/u.  One 
possible  layout  was  found  at  2.1  Kilpatrick  introducing 
some  equipartitioning 
the  design.  The 
calculated  beam  behaviour  was  very  satisfying:  high 
transmission,  small  emittance  growth  and  a  well 
compressed  bunch  of  small  phase  width,  which  is  well 
prepared for direct injection into the DTL.

Lowering  the  electrode  voltage  corresponding  to  a 
Kilpatrick  factor  of  1.7  made  new  designs  necessary,  at 
the same time the output energy of the RFQ was fixed to 
2.5  MeV/u.  Up  to  now  the  most  promising  design  was 
found  by  R.  Jameson  employing  equipartitioning  again 
[3].  The  third  solution  of  Table  2  (Sauer)  with  simpler 
design  methods  following  the  rules  of  CURLI  and 

RFQUICK  have  been  obtained  at  higher  input  energies, 
nevertheless showing, that an RFQ design with a constant 
and  modest  voltage  level  is  feasible.  All  examples  from 
Table 2 show low losses and low emittance growth but a 
larger phase width of the bunch, the same is true for the 
2.1 Kilpatrick design, if cut at 2.5 MeV/u. The matching 
of the RFQ input emittances has been done with the help 
of PTEQ [4] which delivers optimised Twiss parameters 
of the ellipses and a smoothed beam behaviour along the 
RFQ.  This  is  an  idealized  assumption:  Former  inves-
tigations  on  the  matching  to  an  RFQ  with  the  help  of  a 
magnetic  LEBT  have  shown  [5],  that  small  changes  in 
current,  solenoid  fields  and  emittances  in  the  order  of  a 
view  percent  do  not  cause  losses  but  generate  a  large 
emittance  growth  in  the  RFQ.  Therefore  quite  larger 
emittances  than  the  ideal  ones  may  be  expected  at  the 
RFQ end. 

A  provisional  layout  of  an  DTL  has  been  done  with 
SUPERFISH  and  PARMILA,  to  check  the  matching 
possibilities at the lower input energy of 2.5 MeV/u. The 
design  was  made  for  constant  transverse  focusing, 
constant  rf  field  amplitude  and  some  initial  phase 
ramping.  In  the  very  first  part  of  the  DTL  the  filling 
factor had to be risen to 0.59 at pole tip fields below 1.0 
T.  Afterwards  it  was  kept  to  0.5  and  lower.  After  some 
initial  checks  of  the  beam  dynamics  with  matched  input 
emittances  generated  by  the  program  TRACE3D  which 
showed  a  good  beam  behaviour,  RFQ  output  emittances 
calculated  with  PARMTEQM  were  taken  as  an  input  to 
PARMILA. In all cases a short drift of b
/2 (6.2 cm) was 
assumed between RFQ and DTL. Emittance growth was 
unavoidable  in  that  case.  Fig.  2  shows  the  calculated 
output emittances of the DTL at 20 MeV/u, with RFQ 3 
of Table 2 as the previous accelerator.

4  MEBT DESIGN 

In  the following a compact matching section (MEBT) 
with  a  length below 1.0 m is discussed. The design was 
made  with  TRACE3D  which  calculates  the  optimised 
field  strength  of  the  four  magnetic  quadrupoles  (for 
transverse matching) and the two rebuncher cavities (for 
longitudinal  matching).  The  result  is  a  mismatch  factor 
between  RFQ  and  DTL  smaller  than  1  from  first  2.5 
without MEBT. Transfer of this MEBT to PARMILA and 
injection of the RFQ output emittances via matching line 
into  the  DTL  showed  a  large  improvement  in  the  beam 
behaviour as can be seen in comparing Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. 

mismatch  factor  smaller  than  1  again.  Fig  5.  shows  the 
output  emittances  after  the  DTL,  when  the  calculated 
output  emittances  of  the  120  MHz  RFQ  were  taken  as 
input  to  MEBT  and  DTL  for  PARMILA.  Again  100% 
transmission and an rms emittances growth of about 10% 
only were obtained for MEBT and DTL.

6  CONCLUSIONS 

 
Figure 3: Output emittances of the 175 MHz DTL with a 
MEBT of 0.686 m between RFQ and DTL. 

The beam is quite nicely matched along the DTL with an 
rms emittance growth of 10 %, no losses and well shaped 
output  emittances.  Moreover  such  a  design  allows  the 
installation of steerers as well as beam diagnostics and of 
a  valve  and  bellows,  which  is  important  in  the  practical 
view of an accelerator facility [7]. 

5  BEAM DYNAMICS LAYOUT OF RFQ 

AND DTL AT 120 MHZ 

Layout  of  RFQ  and  DTL  have  been  repeated  for  a 
lower frequency of 120 MHz, which gives for the 4-Rod-
RFQ  still  small  geometrical  dimensions  [6].  The  ad-
vantage is a lower rf defocusing term and higher focusing 
efficiency,  therefore  RFQ  layouts  for  1.7  Kilpatrick  are 
more easily reached for the reference energy also with the 
conventional design method. A transmission of more than 
90 % with 40 % rms emittance growth were achieved. At 
2.5  MeV/u  the  relation  between  longitudinal  output 
emittance  of  the  RFQ  and  the  acceptance  of  the  DTL  is 
nearly  the  same  as  in  the  case  at  175  MHz.  Again  the 
length of the RFQ output bunch of about 70(cid:176)  is too large 
for direct injection into the DTL. With the same matching 
procedure as before using TRACE3D and b
/2 (which is 
now 9.1 cm) as basic length for drift, rebuncher cavities 
and quads a MEBT of 1.0 m has been designed for a low

mA  D+  RFQ  at  1.7  Kilpatrick.  was  successfully  carried 
out  for  both  frequencies  175  MHz  and  120  MHz  resp. 
While  for  a  RFQ  with  high  end  energy  and  a  very  well 
bunched output beam with a small phase width of about 
– 20(cid:176)  a direct injection into the DTL shows smooth beam 
behaviour,  low  emittance  growth  and  no  losses.  A 
matching  line  seems  to  be  favourable  in  the  case  of  a 
shorter  RFQ  with  lower  end  energy  and  larger  phase 
width  of  the  output  bucket  to  prevent  filamentation  and 
large  emittance  growth  in  the  beam.  In  addition  a

disadvantages of both cases have to be studied carefully,

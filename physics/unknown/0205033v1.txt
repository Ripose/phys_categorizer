Abstract. The absence of an identified consequence at solar system scale of the
cosmological  space  expansion  is  usually  explained  considering  that  space
expansion does not affect local anysotropies in matter distribution. This can also
be  explained  considering  a  time  dependent  scenario  compatible  with  Relativity
Principle, therefore supporting physical laws independent of the time position of
the  observer.  A  theory  considering  such  relativist  scenario,  i.e.,  generalizing
Relativity  Principle  to  position,  embodies  Cosmological  Principle  and  can  be
intrinsically  able  to  fit  directly  both  local  and  cosmic  data.  In  part  I  it  is
presented the general framework of such a theory, called Local Relativity (LR),
and analysed the space-time structure. Special Relativity space-time is obtained,
with  no  formal  conflict  with  Einstein  analysis,  but  fully  solving  apparent
paradoxes and conceptual difficulties, including the simultaneity concept and the
long discussed Sagnac effect. In part II, LR is applied to positional analysis. It is
verified the accordance with solar system measurements and with classic cosmic
tests, without dark matter or dark energy. Two of the new features obtained in
part II are the possibility of a planetary orbital evolution compatible with a null
determination  for  G  variation,  supporting  a  warmer  scenario  for  earth  (and
Mars)  past  climate,  and  the  possibility  of  an  accelerating  component  in  earth
rotation, compatible with the most recent measurements.

1. Introduction

Most cosmological models consider a variation with time of matter/space characteristics, either
considering  the  time  variation  of  some  fundamental  physical  parameter  (i.e.,  a  fundamental
magnitude or constant) or/and a cosmological line element affected by a time dependent scale
factor, as the standard model for cosmology. A problem of such a scenario is that the validity
of  fundamental  physical  laws  and  theories  through  time  is  not  clear  because  they  ignore  the
possibility  and  the  consequences  of  a  variation  of  matter/space  with  time.  Einstein  [1]
considered that Relativity Theory is  not  valid  in  a  space  expansion  scenario  because  this  one
conflicts with fundamental aspects of Special Relativity, namely the non-local determination of

2

the  time  coordinate.  Note  that  Einstein  Relativity  does  not  impose  the  time  invariance  of
matter/space  characteristics,  namely  the  time  constancy  of  light  speed.  Such  possibility  was
simply not considered. At the time, there were  no  observational  results  able  of  supporting  it.
As  it  is  evident,  there  is  no  incompatibility  between  Relativity  Principle  and  a  positional
(Time/Space)  variation  of  matter/space  able  of  supporting  physical  laws  independent  of  the
position of the observer. Relativity Principle states that physical laws, or “laws of nature”, can
be represented as a function only of measures relative to the observer. Einstein determined its
consequences,  in  what  concerns  motion  and  gravitational  field  but  not  in  what  concerns
position in Time or Space. This situation is similar to the relation between Special and General
Relativity: Special Relativity did not considered gravitational fields but that does not mean that
Special Relativity implies that a motion is not affected by the presence of a gravitational field.
What it means is that Special Relativity is valid “only so long as we are able to disregard the
influences of gravitational fields on phenomena (e.g. of light).” [2]

To build a cosmological theory, something has to be stated on how phenomena depend on
position. Cosmological Principle states that there is nothing special about this particular point
of the Universe where we are. This is an important anti-anthropomorphic statement. However,
it  is  only  that.  It  does  not  imply  that  the  Universe  has  to  be  uniform,  or  isotropic,  or  that
phenomena have to follow the same laws whatever the point of the Universe. Statements like
these,  as  well  as  the  presumption  of  the  time  variation  of  some  physical  parameter,  are  just
hypothesis, not supported in experience. Hence, we conclude that the fundamental assumptions
of present cosmological theories are mainly a consequence of the absence of information  and
have  no  direct  support  from  experience.  This  is  not  a  problem,  it  is  just  a  methodology  for
facing the situation; the expectation is to  obtain  a  theory  liable  to  fit  observations.  However,
even the current standard model needs additional hypothesis, namely dark matter, dark energy,
inflation phase, which have also no direct support from experience.

Efforts have been made  to  measure  at  solar  system  scale  consequences  of  the  presumed
space  expansion  or  a  time  variation  on  the  value  of  fundamental  constants.  The  result  is
negative, namely in the analysis of the range data to the Viking landers on Mars [3, 4]. This is
an important result because it indicates that if there is a time dependent phenomenon, either a
space expansion or other variation of matter/space, then it is probably able to support physical
laws independent of position, i.e., such eventual variation probably obeys Relativity Principle.
For  the  first  time,  we  can  state  something  about  the  dependence  of  phenomena  with  time
supported on experience. This enables us to consider that phenomena can be described by laws
dependent only on measures relative to the observer, whatever his motion, field or position on
space and time. This generalization of Relativity Principle embodies Cosmological Principle.

The  above  generalization  of  Relativity  Principle  implies  the  possibility  of  a  variation  of
matter/space characteristics with position, as it happens with motion and field. In such case, it
is  advisable  to  consider  that  the  data  supporting  physical  laws  can  only  be  classified  as  local
because  the  distances  and  time  intervals  involved  are  too  small  for  detecting  an  eventual
variation of matter/space  characteristics  with  space  or  time  position.  Therefore,  we  consider,
this being a key aspect of our analysis, that current fundamental physical laws are locally valid
but we do not presume, «a priori», they have non-local validity. In accordance with this line of
thought, we consider also that there is only experimental support for considering that Relativity
Principle  applies  to  local  laws.  This  does  not  mean  that  it  does  not  apply  non-locally  either,
only that  one  cannot  presume  it  «a  priori».  To  the  theory  this  way  obtained  we  called  Local
Relativity.

3

In this work we first establish the general framework of Local Relativity.  This framework
defines how matter/space properties can vary but not how do they actually vary. To find that
out, one has to analyse the consequences of motion, field  and  position  of  the  observer.  Such
analysis  imply  the  interpretation  of  the  results  of  non-local  observations,  therefore  requires  a
clear  understanding  of  space-time.  The  space-time  structure  is  also  established  in  this  work.
The  positional  analysis  is  necessary  to  test  our  generalization  of  relativity  property,  being
therefore  also  presented.  The  motion  and  field  analyses,  as  well  as  the  development  of
cosmological models, is not the object of present work

This work is divided in two parts. In this part I, we define measuring units and observers,
characterise  the  relativity  property  and  determine  the  relations  between  physical  parameters
imposed by it. The properties of light velocity are carefully characterized. They are all that is
needed  to  obtain  a  trivial  explanation  for  Sagnac  effect  and  to  obtain  the  special  relativity
space-time continuum, now with a clear understanding of the physical  relation  between  Time
and  Space.  This  part  ends  with  the  analysis  of  reference  frames,  indispensable  for  non-local
analysis.  Time  and  Length  paradoxes  of  special  relativity  are  then  fully  solved.  An  important
achievement  of  this  part  I  is  that  we  obtain  the  two  principles  of  Special  Relativity  as  a
consequence of the constancy of mean light speed in a closed path, considering a 3-Euclidian
space with  no  connection  between  time  and  space.  This  leads  to  a  new  understanding  of  the
Universe.

In  part  II,  a  time  varying  scenario  for  matter/space  is  defined  after  redshift  and  cosmic
microwave  background  characteristics.  The  direct  consequences,  without  any  additional
hypothesis like dark matter or dark energy, at cosmic and solar system levels, are presented. It
is verified that they are not contrary to any known observational data and new, testable, results
are obtained.

2. Local Relativity

The  analysis  we  present  next  is  not  an  adaptation  of  Einstein  work.  Local  Relativity  is
deducted independently, exclusively based on relevant experimental results and not on any  of
the results of Einstein Relativity or in the concepts of Space and Time developed  after  them.
The reader is asked the effort of putting aside all that by now, in order to be able to properly
follow our line of thought. Furthermore, what we present here is not a theory developed from
hypotheses but, on the contrary, a research carried on experimental results, sticking as close as
possible  to  their  range  of  validity  and  avoiding  any  statement  or  hypothesis  not  conveniently
supported in them. To the characteristic behaviours of phenomena we call “properties” and do
not classify them as “principles” because they are the consequence of something, even if we do
not  know  what.  When  this  research  is  finished,  the  findings  can  then  be  framed  in  a  theory
deducted from certain fundamental assumptions.

2.1. Local Laws and Local Relativity Principle.

An  essential  aspect  is  that  we  do  not  presume  «a  priori»  the  non-local  validity  of  current
physical laws, considering that we can only attribute local validity to the data on which they are
based.  In  what  concerns  current  fundamental  physical  laws,  we  consider  that  they  are  based
only  on  local  observations  and  can  be  considered  as  local  physical  laws,  i.e.,  the  limit  of

4

general physical laws when rﬁ 0 and dtﬁ 0 in the observer’s reference frame. Note that this
analysis is not intended to be valid at sub-atomic level.

In what concerns the relativity property displayed by phenomena, what can be confidently
stated is that local physical laws seem to be valid whatever the inertial motion of the observer
in our time and space neighbourhood. Note that the range of velocities of the observer is very
small in relation to light speed and one cannot state that laws of mechanics do not neglect an
eventual influence of observer’s motion. In order to obtain a theory for any point of space and
time,  it  is  necessary  to  generalise  the  above  statement.  As  the  successive  local  observations,
although relative to a very small range in space and time, have shown no change in the results,
what can be stated, considering the above, is that:

-  Local physical laws can represent validly, to the first approximation, the instantaneous
relations between the local measures made by an atomic observer in a local physical system,
whatever the inertial motion, gravitational field and position in time and space of the atomic
observer.

We  name  this  enunciation  of  Relativity  Principle  in  our  local  framework  as  Local

Relativity Property (LRP).

2.2. Measuring units

In  order  to  analyse  situations  where  physical  parameters  may  vary,  a  clear  definition  of
measuring units is indispensable. We will use as fundamental magnitudes Mass, Length, Charge
and Time. We will consider that Mass, Length and Charge are measured by comparison with
bodies  chosen  as  standard.  This  does  not  have  to  correspond  to  the  practical  realisation  of
measurements; however, whatever  the  method  used,  the  results  must  correspond  to  the  ones
obtained this way. The magnitude Time is intrinsically different from the other magnitudes. The
crucial  property  of  Time  unit  is  that  Time  unit  must  satisfy  the  invariance  of  local  physical
laws, otherwise there will be a violation of Local Relativity Property. As will be shown later,
such invariance is satisfied provided that the measures of fundamental constants keep invariant.
Therefore, one can define time unit from the constancy of the measure of a convenient physical
constant.

2.3. Constancy of Local Mean Light Speed and Time Unit

In Maxwell electromagnetic theory, light speed in vacuum has the value of the electrodynamic
constant c0. As this constant has the dimensions of a velocity, it seems to be quite suitable for
defining time unit. However, one must note that until now only the mean value of light speed in
a closed circuit has been directly measured, this being the experimental result in which one can
support the definition of time unit.

In  Local  Relativity  framework,  in  order  to  interpret  such  experimental  result,  we  define
local mean light speed as the limit of the measure of mean light speed in a closed path when
the path length tends to zero.

Michelson-Morley  [5]  experiment  showed  that  local  mean  light  speed  is  independent  of
the direction of light ray for an atomic observer at rest on  earth  surface;  Kennedy-Thorndike
[6]  experiment  showed  that  it  is  also  independent  of  the  inertial  motion.  More  recent
experiments,  using  lasers  and  cavities  (note  that  these  are  standing-wave  devices,  therefore
with  a  characteristic  period  dependent  on  a  closed  wave  path),  namely  Brillet  and  Hall  [7],
have  also  concluded  that  the  local  mean  light  speed  measured  by  an  atomic  observer  is

5

constant,  whatever  the  inertial  motion  of  the  observer.  This  conclusion  is  not  entirely
consensual [8].  Nevertheless, we will consider the above statement a local physical law, valid
to  the  first  approximation  in  our  time  and  space  neighbourhood.  We  will  designate  it  by
Michelson Law.

One can note that Michelson law has a trivial explanation if light speed depends on light

source motion (“ballistic” hypothesis) but not if light speed is independent of source motion.

Local Relativity Property requires Michelson law to be valid whatever the inertial motion,
field or position of the observer; therefore, one can define time unit stating that Time Unit is
such that the local mean light speed, measured by an atomic observer, is c0.

2.4. Velocity – the concept and the measure

The concepts of speed or velocity are linked to the ratio between a path length and the time to
cover it, measured with observer’s length and time units. This is enough to make measures of
the mean speed of a radiation or of a body performing a cyclic motion in the neighbourhood of
the observer. The observer measures the path using a measuring rod at rest in relation to him
and measures with his local clock the time interval by noting the time instants he acknowledge
two successive passages of the body or radiation in the same point of space in relation to him.
However, to measure a speed or a velocity between two non-coincident points of space, it is
necessary  to  relate  time  in  the  two  points  with  observer’s  local  time,  i.e.,  to  attribute  time
coordinates  to  those  points  or  to  synchronise  clocks  placed  at  them.  Let  us  remind  the
fundamental aspects of the problem.

For measuring the relative velocity of a body much slower than light, one can neglect the
time light spends between two measuring points, attributing to the passage of the body in each
of  the  points  a  time  coordinate  which  is  the  observer’s  local  time  when  he  sees  the
occurrences. Or, if one wants to be more precise, one can attribute to the one-way light speed
the value c0 of the mean light speed in a closed path, presuming that the one-way value will not
be  very  different  from  this  mean  value.  However,  the  faster  the  body  (in  relation  to  the
observer),  the  greater  the  influence  of  the  value  one  attributes  to  light  velocity  in  the  value
obtained for the velocity of the body. At the limit, if one intends to measure the one-way light
speed, the value obtained is independent of the true one-way light speed and depends only on
the  mean  value  for  light  speed  in  closed  path,  a  result  we  detail  in  the  next  paragraph.  This
implies that an observer cannot make a “direct” measure of one-way light speed, unless he can
use something much faster than light.

In  his  article  of  1905  [9],  Einstein  presented  a  method  for  clocks  synchronisation.  The
solution  presented  by  Einstein  is  to  establish  as  definition  that  the  time  light  spends  from  a
point A to a point B is equal to the time light spends from B to A and to assume that the mean
value  (path  Aﬁ Bﬁ A)  of  light  speed  is  c0.  We  will  now  show  that  this  Einstein  symmetric
synchronisation is possible whatever the values of light speed in each of paths Aﬁ B and Bﬁ A,
provided that its mean value keeps constant. To analyse the process with generality, consider
that light speed is v1 from A to B and v2 from B to A. The clock at A is identical to the clock at
B but marks a different time, the difference being D t. The observers at B and A see the clocks
marking a difference of, respectively:

  is  the  mean  light  speed  in  the  path  Aﬁ Bﬁ A.
where 
Therefore,  when  an  observer  at  A  or  B  measures  light  speed  after  performing  a  symmetric
synchronisation of clocks, what is obtained is the mean value of light speed in the closed path
Aﬁ Bﬁ A and not its one-way value. One can now note that the validity of (3) in relation to a
third  clock  requires  the  constancy  of  the  mean  light  speed  v .  Therefore,  Einstein
synchronisation  is  insensitive  to  the  one-way  light  speed  provided  that  its  mean  value  keeps
invariant.  After  having  defined  the  synchronism,  Einstein  considered,  in  agreement  with
experience, that this mean light speed in a closed path is a universal constant – the velocity of
light in empty space.

Given that the one-way light speed is not known, one could think of other simple methods
of attributing time coordinates or synchronising clocks.  Such  a  method  could  be  to  take  two
identical clocks and then to move them symmetrically from the observer to two points  at  the
same distance of him. The problem is that the fact they are moved symmetrically in relation to
the observer does not guarantee, «a priori», that they are equally affected during  the  motion.
Therefore, one can imagine different simple methods of determining time coordinates, leading
to  different  values  for  the  time  coordinate  of  a  point,  but  one  cannot  establish  «a  priori»  a
criterion for validation.

One  can  also  make  indirect  determinations  of  a  speed,  for  instance,  measuring  a
wavelength  shift.  However,  the  relation  between  the  wavelength  shift  and  speed  depends  on
some  physical  theory,  and  different  relations  can  arise  from  different  theories.  The  same
reasoning applies to methods derived from cosmological observations.

Finally, one can search for more ingenious methods of synchronizing clocks, like Sama’s

[10]. The fact is that a practical and consensual method has not yet been put through.

Considering the above, we conclude that we can establish a concept for speed or velocity
as  the  ratio  between  a  path  length  and  the  time  to  cover  it  in  observer’s  units  and  that  this
concept can be implemented in mean speed measures in closed paths; in what concerns opens
paths,  one  has  not,  until  now,  established  any  definition  of  velocity  with  a  known
correspondence  with  the  concept  above  defined.  That  does  not  prevent  us  from  measuring
velocities by determining the ratio of a variation of length and time coordinates. However the
value  so  obtained  depends  on  the  method  chosen  for  determining  time  coordinates  and,
therefore,  we  have  to  identify  it  when  referring  to  velocity  measures.  In  this  paper  we  will
consider  Atomic  velocities,  Newton  velocities  and  Einstein  velocities,  to  be  defined  later.
Naturally,  the  measures  of  speed  in  closed  paths  are  the  same  whatever  the  method  but  the
one-way measures of velocity can be different.

2.5. Two observers

For the interpretation of observations, the correct characterization of observer properties is of
crucial importance. The same happens when establishing a physical theory. In this work we will
use two different observers.

Local observations can be described as being snapshots of the relative appearance of local
phenomena to a local atomic observer. Therefore, for the analysis of local observations and of
local physical laws it is convenient to consider an atomic observer, the observer A, such that a
local  atom  is  invariant  in  relation  to  him,  whatever  his  motion,  field  and  position.  As  he  is
intended to represent our instruments and  us,  the  A  observer  is  dependent  on  light  speed  for
acknowledging an occurrence.

In cosmic observations, the same observer watches phenomena in different points in time
and  space.  Therefore,  cosmic  observations  may  reflect  the  dependence  with  position
(time/space)  of  physical  laws  in  relation  to  an  invariant  observer.  Therefore,  we  will  also
consider  a  non-atomic  observer,  the  observer  R,  such  that  the  relations  between  the
measuring  units  of  two  R  observers  are  invariant,  whatever  their  relative  motion,  field  or
position.

The problem of attributing time coordinates, as we have already noted, lies in the fact that
an atomic observer depends on the unknown light velocity to acknowledge an  occurrence.  A
way  of  dealing  theoretically  with  this  problem  is  to  introduce  an  observer  that  depends  on
something  much  faster  than  light.  At  the  limit,  a  solution  is  to  introduce  an  observer  with
“instant vision”. To achieve that, we will consider that R observer has “instant vision”, i.e., he
is not dependent on light velocity to acknowledge an occurrence.

One must note that observers are conceptual entities. One can emulate an A observer but

not an R observer. That is irrelevant for the analysis.

2.6. Notation

As  we  will  use  two  different  observers,  measures  and  measuring  units  have  to  be  carefully
identified. The units of measure of fundamental magnitudes are usually represented by the same
letter that represents the magnitude and the units of other physical parameters by the symbol of
the parameter between brackets. This convention is followed in the paper, with the addition of
a  superscript,  identifying  the  observer  to  whom  the  unit  belongs.  The  subscript  identifies  the
observer that measured the parameter. So, the fundamental units of measure of A are MA, QA,
LA  and  TA;  [G]A  represents  the  A  measuring  unit  of  G;  GA  is  the  value  of  G  measured  by  A;
RM =MA/MR);
RM   represents  the  value  of  the  mass  unit  of  A  measured  by  R  (
[ ]A
RG =[G]A / [G]R
 is the value of the A unit of G measured by R.

A

A

The measuring units of R and A are equal at the point in time and space chosen as origin,
named “zero point”, considering an absence of field at the point and that both observers are “at
absolute  rest”.  The  precise  meaning  of  this  concept  is  established  later.  The  local  measures
made in this situation are identical whatever the observer, being identified by the subscript “0”.
LRP  implies  that  the  A  local  value  of  physical  parameters  is  always  the  same  as  the  value
measured in this situation, for instance, GA = G0.

8

2.7. Local Relativity Conditions: physical parameters interdependence

LRP  states  the  invariance  of  our  perception  of  local  phenomena.  This  does  not  imply  the
invariance of physical parameters, only of our measure of  them.  In  order  to  understand  what
this invariance implies, let us analyse the measuring procedure.

The  variations  of  Mass,  Length  and  Charge,  if  the  number  of  atomic  particles  do  not
change,  cannot  be  directly  detected  by  an  atomic  observer  because  they  are  measured
comparing a body with  a  reference  body;  a  variation  of  any  of  those  parameters  affects  both
bodies but not the result of the comparison. In what concerns Time, as Time unit is chosen by
the atomic observer so that physical laws keep invariant, it cannot vary if everything else keeps
invariant.  So,  what  happens  if  a  fundamental  magnitude  changes?  An  atomic  observer  will
conclude  that  a  fundamental  constant  has  changed.  For  instance,  if  Mass  doubles,  the
perception of an atomic observer will be that gravitational constant G has changed because he
will measure a different acceleration between the same bodies at the same distance. However,
what changed was not G but only his measure of G, because the measuring unit [G] changed.
From Newton laws, this measuring unit is related with the units of Mass, Length and Time by
the dimensional equation

[ ]
TLMG

31

The equation shows that if Mass unit doubles and no other magnitude or constant changes, the
unit  of  measure  of  G  becomes  1/2;  therefore,  the  value  determined  for  G  doubles,  provided
that Newton laws keep valid. Now, consider that Mass  doubles  and  G  reduces  to  1/2.  Then,
the  value  determined  for  G  is  the  same:  an  atomic  observer  measures  the  same  acceleration
between  the  same  bodies  at  the  same  distance.  Once  an  atomic  observer  cannot  directly
measure  a  variation  in  fundamental  magnitudes,  if  his  local  measurements  of  fundamental
constants  do  not  display  any  variation  then  his  description  of  local  phenomena  keeps
unchanged. We conclude that the constancy of local measurements of fundamental constants
by an atomic observer is enough condition for LRP.

To  determine  the  relations  between  fundamental  physical  parameters  that  ensure  their
variations  do  not  produce  detectable  consequences  on  local  phenomena  is,  therefore,  to
establish  the  conditions  that  ensure  the  invariance  of  the  local  measure  of  fundamental
constants,  namely  G,  e   and  the  local  mean  light  speed  c.  The  obvious  solution  is  that
fundamental  constants  can  only  vary  accordingly  with  their  dimensional  equations.  We  will
detail the deduction of this result. Their local measures made by an atomic observer A are:

GA =  G0        e A = e 0         cA =  c0           

(5)
The values of fundamental constants to an R observer coincident with the A observer have not
to be the same because A measuring units depend on motion, field and position. As measures
are inversely proportional to measuring units, representing a generic physical entity by phy, it
is:

The objective is to  define  how  fundamental  magnitudes  and  constants  can  vary  in  relation  to
their values in the “zero point”. We will represent this relative variation by the identifying letter
of  the  physical  parameter  without  scripts.  Its  value  is  the  ratio  between  A  and  R  measuring
,  or  the  ratio  between  R  and  A  measures,  for  instance,
units,  for  instance 
c ”

 cR /cA = cR /c0. Rearranging equations (7) one obtains:

RMM ”

A

Conditions (8) are called LR conditions. They are the relations between fundamental physical
parameters that ensure the invariance of their local measure by an atomic observer.

An  important  consequence  of  (8)  is  that,  in  order  to  obey  LRP,  either  all  physical
parameters  are  invariant  or  at  least  two  of  them  have  to  vary.  Cosmological  theories  that
consider a variation of only one parameter imply a variation in local phenomena, which is not
supported  by  observations.  On  the  contrary,  any  matter/space  varying  scenario  to  which
corresponds a variation of fundamental physical parameters in accordance with LR conditions
obeys  Relativity  Principle  at  local  scale,  therefore  being  not  locally  detectable  by  an  atomic
observer but being able to produce observable consequences at non-local scale.

2.8. Variation of Magnitudes and Constants (in R)

phy

As  LRP  implies  the  invariance  of  the  A  measure  of  any  physical  entity,  i.e.,  it  implies
phyA=constant,  then,  from  (6),  the  variation  of  phyR  is  equal  to  the  variation  of  the  A
measuring units of phy in R, [
. In other words, physical entities have to vary accordingly
with  their  dimensional  equations,  as  already  noted.  For  instance,  the  wavelength  (in  R)  of  a
spectral radiation has to vary accordingly to L because  [ ]
l
. One may wonder what  can
be  the  relation  between  both  but  there  is  an  easy  answer:  they  are  both  related,  directly  or
indirectly, with the size of electronic orbitals. Also, the energy of emitted radiation in R has to
vary  with  energy  dimension  ML2T  - 2 = Mc2,  the  Planck  constant  with  McL.  Only  in  this  way
can phenomena keep invariant to A, as stated by the LRP.

When  an  A  observer  makes  non-local  observations,  the  variation  (in  R)  of  non-local
phenomena and of A measuring units are no longer equivalent, therefore A can detect a relative
difference.  For  instance,  in  case  of  a  L  variation  with  time,  A  will  detect  a  wavelength
difference between a radiation from a distant source and the correspondent local radiation, this
considering that there is no change in the wavelength from the source to A. On the other hand,
dimensionless  numbers,  like  the  fine  structure  constant,  have  naturally  to  keep  invariant  in  R
and,  therefore,  in  A  non-local  observations  (considering  that  there  is  no  change  in  light

properties  in  the  path  between  source  and  observer).  The  invariance  of  dimensionless  local
combinations of physical parameters can also be used as an enunciation of LRP. Albrecht and
Magueijo  [11]  have  already  referred  that  physical  experiments  are  only  sensitive  to
dimensionless combinations of dimensional physical parameters. The non-local analysis of such
numbers, namely the analysis of the fine structure constant at cosmic distances [12, 13, 14, 15],
in different gravitational fields or at different velocities, are positional, field and dynamic tests
for LRP and source of information on the change of  light  properties  between  the  source  and
the observer.

2.9. Non-local analysis

To  perform  a  non-local  analysis  implies  the  capability  of  attributing  a  time  and  a  space
coordinate to each point, i.e., to define a reference frame and to establish the correspondence
between the observation of an occurrence and its position in the reference frame. Next chapters
are concerned with this problem.

3. Time and Space

As  already  noted,  the  constancy  of  local  mean  light  speed  is  a  trivial  result  if  light  speed
directly  depends  on  source  motion.  However,  if  this  is  not  the  case,  then,  in  LR  framework,
this law implies that the velocity unit of an atomic observer has to vary with the motion of the
observer, i.e., length and/or time atomic units cannot be invariant. In this case, time and space
for an atomic observer become dependent on  his  motion.  This  reasoning  applies  also  to  field
and position, which cases will not be analysed here. Therefore, the first step is to establish how
light speed depends on source motion.

3.1 Light speed and the state of motion of the emitting body

An important number of experimental and observational results, starting with 1910 Comstock
considerations  on  the  orbits  of  close  binary  stars  and  Tolman  experiment  [16,  17],  being
specially relevant W. de Sitter [18] analysis of binary systems of spectroscopic twin stars, have
systematically concluded that light speed is independent of the motion of its source, although
objections  to  some  results  have  been  presented.  A  report  can  be  found  in  Zhang  [19]  and  in
[20]. Note that, according to Zhang, «the “independence” does not mean that either the one-
way velocity cr of light is equal to the two-way velocity c of light or the one-way velocity of
light is isotropic».  At this point of our analysis, we are not yet in conditions to interpret non-
local results, so we need a local one. Such a local result can be the Sagnac effect [21, 22, 23].
A simple way of accounting for this effect is to consider that light has a one-way speed of c0 in
the lab reference frame, whatever the speed of the source of light. However,  if  light  speed  is
independent of source motion, why should it be constant in relation to the lab? One can state
that  it  is  so,  supported  in  the  absence  of  contrary  evidence,  but  one  must  certainly  look  for
other explanation of Sagnac effect. Special Relativity cannot be used at this point because our
aim is to explain it from the fundamental results obtained so far.

As already referred, what can be stated about the value of light speed is that its local mean
value  measured  by  an  atomic  observer  is  c0,  therefore,  that  the  mean  light  speed  in  a  closed
(and small) circuit is c0 in the lab A reference frame (we call this the Michelson law). Analysing
Sagnac effect, one can note that the displacement of the interferometer produces a fringe phase

Figure 1. Model of the Sagnac interferometer. The figure represents the paths
of two light rays that reach the beam splitter/combiner at the same instant from
opposite  directions,  in  the  lab  A  reference  frame.  The  positions  of  the  beam
splitter when each of light rays was originated are shown with half dotted. Light
speed in the lab A reference  frame  is  v1  and  v2  at  opposite  directions  from  the
beam splitter. Total path of each of light rays (1) or (2) is the circle of radius a
plus or minus the displacement of the  beam  splitter.  The  first  is  a  closed  path,
where the mean light speed is c0 in the A lab reference frame, therefore with the
same time length for both light rays. The time difference between the two light
rays is then, approximately, the time spent by light to cover the displacement of
the beam splitter/combiner in opposite ways, therefore with a mean light speed
of c0, whatever v1 and v2. Sagnac interferometer does not give any indication on
the one-way light speed but it shows  that  light  speed  is  independent  of  source
motion.

shift that depends on the time spent by light  in  covering  the  displacement  path  in  both  ways,
i.e., in a closed path. This conclusion can be illustrated analysing a ring interferometer of radius
a rotating with angular velocity W
 (figure 1). The one-way light speed at opposite ways from
the beam splitter/combiner are v1 and v2 in the A lab reference frame. Then,  the  time  D t1  and
D t2 spent by light rays circulating the ring in one and in the other way is the time for circling
the interferometer plus or minus the time for covering the displacement path. As the first one is
a closed path, the mean light speed in it is c0 and:

where A is the area of the interferometer and  v =2.(v1

effect imply  v =c0 in the A lab reference frame, whatever W

 or a.

Therefore,  Sagnac  effect  can  be  explained  considering  that  the  mean  light  speed  in  a
closed circuit is c0 in the local atomic reference frame and that light speed is independent of
the  motion  of  the  interferometer.  There  is  no  experimental  or  observational  result  that
contradicts these two statements and there is no other property of the speed of light supported
by Sagnac effect. As the first one is already established, what we conclude now is that:

- light velocity in empty space is independent of its source motion.

We will name this the property of light speed independence. It means that in each point of
the Universe, the (one-way) velocity of light in empty space can depend on the position of the
point  in  time-space,  on  the  local  gravitational  field,  on  the  overall  distribution  of  matter,  on
some unknown characteristic of the Universe, but does not depend on the motion of its source.

3.2.“at absolute rest”

Light speed being independent of source motion implies that one can  consider  an  R  observer
with a motion such that one-way light speed in relation to him is isotropic (in the absence of
field, disregarding an eventual anisotropic positional dependence of light properties), whatever
the motion of light source. We will consider that this observer, as well as his reference frame,
is “at absolute rest”, by definition. We will identify such observer by the suffix 0, for instance,
R0. As we are considering a Euclidean space,  because  an  R  observer  has  invariant  measuring
units and “instant vision”, in any R reference frame moving in relation to this one the measure
of light speed is dependent on direction. The same cannot be stated in relation to an A observer
because  this  one  measurements  of  one-way  velocity  depend  on  the  method  used  for
determining  time  coordinates.  Einstein  postulate  of  the  constancy  of  light  speed  concerns  an
atomic observer and we will see later that there is no contradiction between Einstein postulate
and the definition of absolute rest.

We  will  name  velocity  measures  in  R0  as  “absolute  velocities”.  An  A  observer  with  null
absolute velocity (we  are  disregarding  position  dependence)  has  the  same  measuring  units  as
R0, as defined in §2.6. As the A local mean light speed is c0, so it is in R0. Then, the one-way
light speed in any reference frame at absolute rest is c0. The one-way light speed in a reference
frame  at  absolute  rest  is  the  absolute  light  speed.  Therefore,  by  performing  a  local  mean
measure of light speed, an atomic observer obtains the value of the absolute light speed.

3.3. Angles and lines

The  light  speed  source  independence  implies  that  the  velocity  of  a  light  ray  in  relation  to  an
observer  depends  on  this  one  motion.  The  different  angles  and  lines  relevant  for  calculations
are displayed in figure 2, being:

Sight line: defined by the vector cR= c0-V.
Light ray angles: the angle f  between V and c, being f 0 when relative to c0 and f R when
relative  to  cR.  Note  that  the  difference  between  f 0  and  f R  is  not  a  consequence  of
different measuring units but of the motion of the observer.

13

Sight line angle: the angle q  between V and the sight line. It is the direction of the light
source,  when  the  observer  is  receiving  a  light  ray,  or  of  the  emission  ray,  when  the
observer is the source.
Connection line: the line connecting two points of space in the same time moment in R0.
The angle between V and the connection line is y .
Position vector r: the position vector of a point in relation to the observer.

3.4. Length and Time dependence with velocity

Consider  a  light  ray  covering  a  closed  path  in  A  between  two  points,  like  in  each  arm  of
Michelson-Morley experiment. In R0, the system is moving with absolute velocity and the light
ray  has  the  path  represented  in  figure  3,  being  emitted  at  P1  in  the  apparent  direction  of  P2,
reflected in P2’ and received in P1’’From figure 3 one obtains:

The variation of LT- 1 (equation 14) implies a variation of the shape of bodies and, except for
j =b , a variation of the atomic time unit. In spite of these variations, space is still Euclidean. In
LR  theoretical  framework,  the  procedure  used  by  Einstein  to  determine  the  function  j (V)  is
not  valid  because  it  requires  the  non-local  validity  of  physical  laws,  what  is  not  presumed  in
LR.

To  explain  the  local  invariance  of  phenomena  in  relation  to  an  atomic  observer,  i.e.,  to
satisfy  LRP,  the  L  and  T  dependence  with  velocity  is  not  enough:  other  physical  parameters
have also to vary, according to LR conditions. To determine such variation is not important at
this point.

3.5. Time coordinates

Consider an atomic observer  with  absolute  velocity  V1  and  a  body  with  absolute  velocity  V2.
The  atomic  observer  depends  on  light  to  know  the  spatial  position  of  the  body.  Figure  4
represents the situation.

Figure 4. In the moment t0, the atomic observer is at P1 and the body at P2. At
that  moment  a  light  ray  exits  the  body.  In  the  moment  t’0,  the  light  ray  is
received by the observer. At that moment, the observer is at P3 and the body at
P4.  The  atomic  observer  “sees”  then  the  body  at  P4A  (open  circle).  As  q R=y 1,
the A observer “sees” the body in the relative position it had when the light ray
exited it.

When the observer receives the light ray from the body, in the moment t’0, he “sees” the body
in its relative position at the moment the light ray exited the body, the moment t0. In figure 4,
the body is represented by a point but if one considers a body with a size, then one concludes
that it is “seen” with the same angular size it had in relation  to  the  observer  at  t0,  i.e.,  at  the
same distance.

To analyse the space position of moving bodies in relation to an atomic observer, we will
consider a system of coordinates formed by the position vector r, with origin in the observer,

16

or

characterised by its size or modulus and by the angle between observer’s absolute velocity and
position  vector.  The  measure  of  r  modulus  is  not  a  problem  (theoretically)  because  the
observer can mark the space around him using a rigid measuring rod at rest in relation to him.
In  order  to  determine  the  correspondent  time  instants,  i.e.,  the  time  coordinate,  the  observer
has to calculate the time spent by light between the body and him, because what he knows is
the time instant he received the light ray in his proper time units

The time spent by a light ray from a point with a position vector rA is, from (18) (note that

where  (rA·V1)=rAV1cosq A  is  the  internal  product  of  the  two  vectors.  When  the  A  observer
knows  his  absolute  velocity,  then  he  can  use  (20);  when  he  does  not  know  that,  he  can
presume that light speed in relation to him is c0 or he can simply neglect the time spent by light.
To each of these three cases there corresponds different values for time coordinates. In the first
case we will name the time coordinates by Atomic time coordinates and represent them by tA;
in the second case, we name them Einstein time coordinates (tE); and in the third case, Newton
time coordinates (tN). When referred to a specific point, this one is indicated by a superscript;
when referring to the observer (proper time), the superscript is O. The relation between these
time coordinates and proper time is:

3.6. Measures of Velocity

Consider an observer A with constant absolute velocity V1 and a body B with constant absolute
velocity  V2.  In  R0,  at  two  successive  instants  t0  and  t’0,  the  positions  of  body  and  observer
define the vectors rR and r’R. The relative velocity of the body in R units is

The description of Doppler effect in R is the classical one. The Doppler effect in A is obtained
from  the  Doppler  effect  in  R  just  by  changing  to  the  atomic  measuring  units.  Consider  an
observer with absolute velocity V and an electrodynamic wave from a distant source so that the
angle f  between  V  and  the  wave-normal  is  constant.  The  relative  velocity  of  the  wave  along
the wave normal is:
=

Therefore the relation between the frequency of the wave in R0, f0, and in R is:

Doppler  effect,  dependent  on  absolute  velocities,  can  therefore  be  represented  by  a  simple
physical law disregarding the absolute velocities. This is obtained by using measures of velocity
that disregard the one-way velocity of light, considering whatever value for this one provided
that it is the same in both ways. As the mean light speed is c0, only Einstein measure of velocity
can be compatible with consistent electrodynamic’s laws independent of absolute velocities.

3.9 Special Relativity

The above property of Doppler effect is not an isolate case. For instance, the relation between
sight line angles for two observers is easy to obtain in the particular case where the angle f 0 is
the same for the two observers, which corresponds to V1//V2. In that case:

Therefore,  at  least  some  phenomena  can  be  described  by  physical  laws  independent  of  the
absolute motion of the observer. This result is a consequence of the constancy  of  local  mean
light  speed,  or  Michelson  law.  If  one  now  considers  a  system  of  coordinates  where  time
coordinates are obtained considering that one-way light speed is c0, then vE in equations (38)
and (39) gives place to the usual definition of velocity (the ratio between the variation of length
and time coordinates). Therefore, some or all phenomena can be represented by physical laws
independent  of  the  inertial  translational  motion  of  the  observer  in  a  system  of  coordinates
where the measure of light speed is constant This conclusion corresponds to the two principles
of Special Relativity.

We  have  obtained  equation  (38)  from  the  physics  of  Doppler  effect,  considering
Michelson law. Because of that, we are aware of the particular nature of vE. If, instead, we had
only experimental results and ignored the physics of the phenomenon, we could have reached
the same equation, however ignoring the particular nature of vE. Analysing the law so obtained,
we  could  then  verify  that  it  keeps  invariant  in  a  Lorentz  coordinates  transformation.  This  is
what happens with Maxwell laws and Einstein analysis of general laws of nature as  they  are
obtained from experience. Because the reference frame that supports Lorentz transformation is
such that in it the measure of light velocity is always constant, the  Einstein  postulate  of  light
speed  constancy  holds  in  it.  Therefore,  Michelson  law  and  light  speed  source  independence
lead  to  light  speed  constancy  in  Einstein  reference  frame.  However,  the  reason  for  such
constancy is not the result of some connection between Time and Space.

From the above, we can now understand why light speed is constant in Maxwell laws: it is
the Einstein velocity of light, which, as we have already noted, has the value of the local mean
light speed, c0. Equation (38) for Doppler effect was obtained in a 3-Euclidean space, with no

connection  between  Time  and  Space.  Therefore,  the  fact  that  equation  (38)  is  invariant  in  a
Lorentz  transformation,  as  it  happens  with  Maxwell  laws,  does  not  imply  any  particular
characteristic for space-time.

Einstein  Special  Relativity,  because  it  is  based  in  laws  of  nature  obtained  from
experience, namely Maxwell laws, does not reach the physical understanding that is possible in
Local  Relativity  framework.  Maxwell  laws  correspond  to  equation  (38)  for  Doppler  effect:
they  can  fit  observational  results  but  are  not  a  physical  description  of  the  phenomenon.
Doppler effect is physically described as a consequence of the relative velocity of light and of
the  variation  of  observer’s  units  with  velocity.  We  have  not  yet  reached  a  knowledge  of
electrodynamics  that  allow  us  to  establish  the  physical  description  of  the  phenomenon.  This
suggest  us  that  is  not  directly  from  Maxwell  laws  that  one  can  expect  to  obtain  a  sound
electrodynamics theory, in spite of the present success of electromagnetic theory.

An  important  aspect  that  this  analysis  evidences  is  that  one  cannot  expect  to  develop  a
sound  physical  theory  directly  from  general  laws  of  nature  as  they  are  obtained  from
experience. Such a theory is just a first step in the analytical work because observational data is
not absolute but relative to an atomic observer. Special Relativity and Ptolemy’s theory are just
two of the many present and past such theories.  They can be useful but one must go beyond
them.

4. Reference frames

There  are  reasons  for  considering  several  reference  frames.  One  is  that  the  appropriated
calibration  methods  are  not  always  possible  or  practical,  as  in  length  calibration  for
astronomical  distances.  Another  one  is  that  the  observer  lacks  essential  data  for  Time
calibration, namely the knowledge of his absolute velocity. A different kind of reason is that an
appropriate choice of the reference frame can greatly simplify the analysis. For instance, due to
the relativity property exhibited by phenomena, an atomic reference frame can be more useful
than  an  R  reference  frame.  Also,  as  we  have  seen  in  the  analysis  of  Doppler  effect,  possibly
because the variation of atomic properties with velocity is dependent on the mean light speed
and not on the one-way light speed, an atomic reference frame with Einstein time coordinates
can lead to much simpler analyses. Here we will analyse two atomic reference frames. The first
one  uses  Atomic  time  coordinates,  defined  in  the  first  of  equations  (22);  we  name  it  the  A
reference frame. The other one has Einstein time  coordinates  (the  second  of  equations  (22));
we name it the Einstein reference frame. In both, length calibration is made by means of rigid
measuring rods at rest in the reference frame.

4.1. Reference frame A

The  coordinates  of  an  A  reference  frame  correspond  to  the  coordinates  of  the  associated  R
reference  frame  (i.e.,  the  R  reference  frame  with  axis  coincident  with  the  axis  of  the  A
reference frame) modified by the relation between A and R measuring units. Note that there is
no need to present any definition of synchronism for an R observer because this observer is not
dependent on light for acknowledging an occurrence: he has “instant vision”.

The  ZZ  axis  is  identical  to  the  YY  axis  and  we  will  not  refer  to  it.  Although  a  spherical
coordinates system may be the most appropriate, we use a system of orthogonal axis to  ease
the comparison with Special Relativity. Now, let us consider a second A reference frame and
the associated R reference frame. At t=0 the axis of all reference frames are coincident and the
relative motion is along XX axis. This is a simplifying assumption. We will use it because our
objective  is  not  to  establish  the  general  theory  of  atomic  reference  frames  but  to  clarify  the
relation between Time and Space.  Between the R1 and R2 reference frames, once measuring
units are the same, only the XX coordinate is different, being:

The time coordinate transformation in (42) shows that if two occurrences have the same
time  coordinate  in  one  absolute  reference  frame,  the  same  happens  in  all  absolute  reference
frames, i.e., simultaneity is absolute.

To  determine  the  A  reference  frame  we  have  yet  to  determine  the  function  j (V).  In  the
framework of Local Relativity one cannot state that the coordinates transformation has to  be
independent of absolute velocities and the value of j (V) cannot be determined as Einstein did
in Special Relativity. The determination of j (V) is not necessary for the purpose of the paper
and we will not analyse it here.

4.2. Einstein reference frame

We  will  now  analyse  the  atomic  reference  frame  where  time  coordinates  are  established
considering that the one-way light speed is c0. The importance of such a reference frame is the
possibility  that  non-local  physical  phenomena  may  be  described  in  it  by  physical  laws
independent of absolute velocity, as it happens with Doppler effect, therefore verifying Einstein
Relativity Principle.

This kind of reference frame is sometimes referred as Lorentz reference frame because it
supports Lorentz coordinates  transformation,  being  the  reference  frame  of  Special  Relativity.

We  will  name  it  Einstein  reference  frame  and  we  define  an  Einstein  observer  as  an  atomic
observer that determines the time coordinate of an occurrence at a distance rA considering that
the time light spends between the occurrence and the observer is rA /c0. .

For an R observer, who has “instant vision”, two clocks are synchronised when he “sees”
them marking the same. For an Einstein observer, two clocks are synchronised when he sees a
difference between the clocks that is equal to the distance between clocks divided by c0. The
time light takes from a point at a distance rA to the origin is, from (20):

All clocks marking a difference, as seen by R, according with (43), are considered synchronised
by the Einstein observer. For an R observer, the E (Einstein) clocks are not synchronised. We
will name this difference (44) the Einstein synchronisation bit. Furthermore, as (44) is a linear
function of x, the clocks are considered synchronised by any Einstein observer moving with the
same velocity, fulfilling Einstein conditions for synchronism.

The E time coordinate is the atomic time coordinate plus the synchronisation bit (44):

Equation  (45)  is  immediate  from  (22)  but  here  we  wanted  to  clarify  the  meaning  of  the
synchronization bit.

Equation (45) shows that an  Einstein  reference  frame  exhibits  dependence  between  time
and  space:  its  time  coordinate  is  a  function  of  length  coordinate.  It  is  also  a  function  of
velocity. As Einstein concluded, a velocity change affects clocks “synchronisation”, i.e., clocks
are  considered  to  be  “synchronised”  by  all  Einstein  observers  relatively  at  rest  but  not  by
Einstein observers with different motions.

4.3. Lorentz transformation

As  we  have  done  for  the  transformation  between  A  reference  frames,  we  begin  by  the
coordinates transformation between E and R reference frames with coincident axis. Noting that
tA=tR/T, from (40) and (45) it is:

Note  the  correspondence  with  the  change  of  variables  presented  by  Lorentz  in  his  article  of
1904  [26].  The  invariance  of  Maxwell  laws  with  such  a  change  of  variables  means  that  they
have the same form either expressed in function of absolute unities as expressed in function of
the coordinates of an Einstein reference frame. This implies that they are invariant whatever the

Einstein reference frame. In the following, we will analyse, as  before,  the  simple  case  of  two
observers with absolute velocities along their connection line.

Let us consider a second Einstein reference frame and  the  associated  R  reference  frame.
Using  (41)  and  (46)  one  obtains  the  coordinates  transformation  between  two  Einstein
reference  frames  that  are  coincident  at  t=0  and  are  moving  along  the  XX  axis  with  relative
uniform Einstein velocity vE:

 is the measure of E2 velocity by  E1  (ratio  of  length

and  time  Einstein  coordinates).    It  corresponds  to  the  Einstein  collinear  velocity,  already
established (31), being in this case q  = 0. A useful relation is b EvE = b 1b 2(V2-V1).

To make  the  transformation  (47)  independent  of  absolute  velocities  requires  to  consider
j (V) = constant.  As  j (0) = 1,  by  definition,  this  implies  j (V) = 1  (or,  as  Lorentz  considered,
that it “differs from unity no more than by a quantity of the second order”). Note that this does
not correspond to any direct physical reality, neither does the constancy of the one-way light
speed. We are just defining a practical reference frame, suitable for analyses of phenomena that
can  be  described,  in  relation  to  each  atomic  observer,  by  equations  that  depend  only  on  the
mean  light  speed,  like  Doppler  effect  or  electrodynamics.    At  this  point,  we  do  not  know
whether this is a general property of phenomena and if it applies not only to motion but also to
field  and  position.  Note  also  that  (47)  is  valid  only  for  a  relative  motion  according  with
equation  (41);  as  referred,  this  is  a  simplifying  assumption,  intended  to  support  a  simple
analysis on the relation between time and space.

One  remarkable  characteristic  of  Lorentz  transformation  (47)  is  that  (for  j (V) = 1),  the
transformation is independent of absolute velocities, in spite of the fact that Einstein reference
frame (46) is dependent on absolute velocities.

4.4. Einstein reference frame in Local Relativity and in Special Relativity
Consider a light ray that exits the origin of an Einstein reference frame at t = 0, local time, and
reaches  a  point  P  at  a  distance  l,  where  a  local  clock  marks  l/c0.  This  is  characteristic  of  an
Einstein reference frame, no matter if the framework is Local Relativity or Special Relativity.
However,  in  LR  framework,  where  simultaneity  is  absolute,  more  affirmations  can  be
produced.  Consider  that  the  Einstein  reference  frame  was  moving  with  absolute  velocity  V
along the XX axis and that P is on the positive XX axis. In LR framework one can say that the
2 when the light ray exited the origin and l/c0 when the light ray
clock at P was marking –lV/c0
reached it. At that instant, the clock in the origin was marking (1+V/c0).l/c0. One can therefore
conclude  that  the  light  ray  spent  a  time  of  (1+V/c0).l/c0  to  cover  the  path,  measured  in  the
atomic time units of the observer, the relative velocity being then b  2(c0-V) = c0/(1+V/c0).

One must note that the only particularity of Einstein reference  frame,  besides  implying  a
value  for  j (V)  not  yet  determined  in  Local  Relativity,  is  the  synchronisation  bit.  The
dependence  of  Length  and  Time  with  velocity  is  not  a  consequence  of  the  constancy  of  the
measure of one-way light speed but a consequence of the constancy of local mean light speed
and  of  light  speed  independence  in  relation  to  source  motion,  having  been  obtained  in  LR
framework.

4.5. Time paradox in Lorentz transformation

The  characteristics  of  Einstein  reference  frame  originate  apparent  time  and  length  paradoxes
that  one  can  now  easily  understand,  although  some  analytical  work  is  required.  The  main
conclusions are presented in italic.

First of all, one can note that  for  an  E  observer  the  local  clock  of  any  other  E  observer
with  a  different  velocity  seems  to  run  more  slowly  than  his  own.  Consider  two  Einstein
reference  frames,  E1  and  E2,  with  absolute  velocities  V2>V1  along  XX  axis.  From  (46),  the
relation between E1 and E2 time coordinates at E1 origin (O1) is:

(48)

To simplify the notation, when the coordinate is relative to the origin of the reference frame we
will omit its indication. Equation (48) means that an observer at E2 concludes that time in E1
runs more slowly that in E2, at a constant rate b E. Repeating the reasoning for O2, one obtains:

Therefore, an observer at E1 concludes the opposite. This peculiar result is consequence of the
velocity dependence of both the time unit and the synchronisation bit. From equation (45) that
characterizes the Einstein time coordinate, noting that tA2= b 1b 2

-1tA1, one obtains:

In  each  of  equations  (50),  the  first  term  of  second  member  represents  the  relation  between
  and  the
proper  times  and  the  second  term  the  synchronisation  bit.  For  E1, 
synchronisation bit of E1 adds a retarding component that overcomes the shorter E2 time unit;
for E2, 
 and the synchronisation bit of E2 adds an accelerating component that is not
enough  to  compensate  for  the  larger  time  unit  of  E1.  To  show  how  the  two  effects,  i.e.,
different proper times and synchronisation bit, compose to obtain the results (48) and (49), one
has just to replace the length coordinate using the first of equations (47); for instance, for E2,
noting that xE1=0, it is

Therefore, although the proper time of a moving clock in a Einstein reference frame can be
slower  or  faster  than  the  proper  time  of  the  observer,  depending  on  absolute  velocities,  the
synchronisation  bit,  which  transforms  the  proper  time  in  the  time  coordinate,  is  such  that  a
moving  clock  is  always  delayed  in  relation  to  the  clocks  of  the  reference  frame  (time

coordinates).  The  observer  concludes  that  his  proper  time  unit  is  shorter  than  the  ones  of
moving bodies.

Now, if one considers two E observers that execute a back and forth relative motion, one
is  induced  from  (48)  and  (49)  to  the  conclusion  that  each  one  would  see  the  other  in  retard
when they return to initial positions, which is known as the twin’s paradox. The error in this
reasoning is that Lorentz transformation (47) is valid only for a relative motion according to
(41), where the origins of reference frames are coincident at t=0. Therefore, (47) is valid when
the two observers get apart but not when they return. Note that this limitation on the validity
of  Lorentz  transformation  (47)  is  not  a  consequence  of  our  particular  deduction  of  the
coordinates transformation.

To analyse this problem using Lorentz transformation, one can to modify (41) considering
a  generic  initial  position  on  XX  axis.  The  following  generalised  Lorentz  transformation  for  x
and t is obtained:

where D t and D x are the differences between the values of the coordinates of current point and
of E1 origin at initial position. Using (52) one can now analyse the simple case where E1 is “at
absolute  rest”  and  E2  has  a  velocity  V  at  t = 0,  when  the  origins  are  coincident,  till  the
reversing  point,  when  E2  inverts  the  motion,  i.e.,  its  velocity  become  -V.  At  the  reversing
point, which is the initial position for the returning motion, the XX coordinate of E1 origin (in
E2) is designated by lE2 and proper times by tE1,0 and tE2,0.

Let  us  begin  by  analysing  from  E1.  The  relation  between  time  coordinates  at  E2  origin

This is an obvious result because E1 time coordinate has null synchronisation bit (null absolute
velocity) and, as the absolute velocity of E2 has a constant modulus, his time unit is always b
times longer. Therefore, when the two observers meet each other, E1 sees the clock of E2 in
retard:

Therefore, E2 concludes that the clock of E1 is in advance, in accordance with E1 conclusion
(54).  The  use  of  generalised  Lorentz  transformation  leads  to  a  consistent  result  and  time
paradox  disappears.  However,  although  we  have  obtained  consistency,  we  have  not  yet

This synchronisation bit inverts signal when velocity changes, in a time interval

longer than his own.

The question is: if E2 always observes E1 clock running more slowly than its own, how does it
happens  that  E1  clock  is  in  advance  when  they  meet?  The  answer  is  that  when  E2  inverts
velocity, its synchronisation bit changes from positive to negative, retarding time coordinate, as
equations (55) show (note that lE2<0). This is evident using (50) (note that

When  his  velocity  changes,  E2  will  note  that  the  clocks  along  XX  axis  are  no  longer
“synchronised” because clocks “synchronisation” depends on velocity, as noted before. When
E2 re-synchronises the clocks, he changes the time coordinate at E1 origin and E1 local clock
becomes in advance. This is a consequence of the fact that the time light takes between E1 and
E2 changes because E2 is now moving toward the light ray and before it was moving away. It
is also a consequence of the synchronisation method, of course, but it is not a consequence of
any  physical  phenomenon  associated  with  the  acceleration  required  for  changing  velocity.
One  must  note  that  between  tE1,0  and  tE1,0+lE1/(c0+V)  Lorentz  transformation  is  not  valid
because the motion of the observers is not uniform, as required by equation (41). The velocity

in the synchronisation bit is not V or -V but the mean value of E2 velocity in the time interval
defined by light from O1 to O2, which, in this case, varies from V to –V in that time slot. The
relation between E2 time coordinate of E1 origin and proper time of E1 is illustrated in figure
6.

4.6. Length paradox in Lorentz transformation

Using Lorentz transformation, the length of a rigid rod moving in an Einstein reference frame
is always shorter than the length of an identical rod at rest in the reference frame and function
of Einstein velocity.  One  can  see  from  equations  (45),  which  characterise  Einstein  reference
frame, that the length of a rod depends only on the absolute velocity. The reason of the above
result is that the measure of length is made considering the spatial positions of the extremes of
the rod in the same time coordinate of Einstein reference frame and this is not the same instant
for  an  R  observer.  Length  paradox  is  just  a  consequence  of  the  synchronisation  bit  and  the
analysis of it is now trivial, so we will not present it here.

4.7. Attributing coordinates from observations.

An  atomic  observer  acknowledges  an  occurrence  by  receiving  information  on  it  carried  by  a
light  ray  or  by  a  field.  The  information  he  obtains  is  relative  to  a  time  instant  that  is  not  the
time  instant  of  the  reception.  The  time  difference  between  the  occurrence  and  reception
moments depends on the relative distance between the occurrence and the observer and on the
light speed relative to the observer. On observing a system of moving particles, the information
received  in  one  moment  does  not  portray  the  system  in  one  moment  but  each  particle  in  a
different  moment.  The  practical  consequences  of  this  are  very  small  and  usually  negligible
except in two cases: in electrodynamics and in cosmic observations.

On the other hand, the information relative to a system received in the same point in time
and  space  by  two  atomic  observers  with  different  motions  is  differently  understood  because
they have different measuring units; if the observers are in difference points of space, also the
time interval between  an  occurrence  and  its  observation  is  different.  Therefore,  two  different
atomic observers present different descriptions of the same occurrence, and these descriptions
cannot be transformed simply by a Galilean transformation. One consequence of this is that to
interpret  the  interaction  between  fast  moving  particles,  one  has  to  obtain  the  description  of
phenomena in reference frames moving with each of the particles.

In what concerns cosmic observations from an earth observer, for a basic analysis one can
neglect the consequences of observer motion and field. In this case, where the reference frame
is  “at  absolute  rest”  (approximately)  and  field  consequences  are  neglected,  R,  A  or  Einstein
reference frames of the earth observer are identical in LR framework. This is a convenient first
scenario for the analysis of the positional dependence of physical parameters.

5. Conclusion (Part I)

The results already obtained can be summarised as follows.

Light  speed  is  independent  of  source  motion;  it  can  depend  on  the  overall  matter
distribution in the Universe, on the local gravitational field, on the time-space position, or/and
on  some  unknown  characteristic  of  the  Universe,  but  not  on  its  source  motion.  This
fundamental  characteristic  of  light  is  stated  in  the  property  of  light  speed  independence.  In

28

this  case,  one  shall  expect  atomic  structure  to  depend  on  motion,  implying  atomic  units
dependent  on  motion.  The  problem  is  to  characterise  such  dependence.  Michelson-Morley
experiment,  together  with  other  related  experiments,  can  be  explained  considering  that  the
geometry of atomic structure change with velocity in such a way that the time a light ray takes
to  go  to  a  point  at  a  fixed  atomic  distance  and  return  is  independent  of  direction  and  its
measure in atomic time units seems to be constant. This characteristic of atomic structure  is
stated  in  the  Michelson  law  of  the  constancy  of  local  mean  light  speed.  This  suggests  that
atomic structure and atomic properties may depend on  the  relative  bi-directional  propagation
speed  of  fields  or  of  interaction  particles.  The  change  in  atomic  properties  seems  to  be  such
that local physical laws, in relation to an atomic observer, are invariant. This is stated in Local
Relativity  Property.  This  property  implies  a  relation  between  fundamental  magnitudes  and
constants, expressed by Local Relativity Conditions.

The  non-local  analysis  of  physical  systems  with  different  motion,  field  or  position  is
necessary to determine how do physical parameters  vary  in  each  case.  To  interpret  non-local
observations, the time-space structure has to be characterised.

The  analysis  of  Doppler  effect  in  LR  framework  shows  that  some  (at  least)  non-local
phenomena can be described by physical laws independent of the  inertial  translational  motion
of  the  observer  in  an  atomic  reference  frame  where  time  coordinates  are  established
considering  that  one-way  light  speed  is  constant.  This  is  what  the  two  postulates  of  Special
Relativity  state.  However,  we  have  obtained  this  result  in  a  3-Euclidean  space  with  no
connection between space and time. Therefore, non-local observations can be interpreted using
such structure  for  space  and  time.  The  Special  Relativity  line  element  is  not  characteristic  of
time-space but only of Special Relativity reference frame.

A number of problems are solved, like the interpretation of Sagnac effect, the Time-Space
connection,  the  simultaneity  concept  and  the  mathematical  and  physical  reasons  of  Time  and
Length paradoxes. It is important to note that the analysis here presented at no point conflicts
(formally) with Einstein’s article of 1905.

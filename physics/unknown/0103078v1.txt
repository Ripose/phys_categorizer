Abstract

A recent proposal asserts that gravitational forces arise due to an interaction between matter and vacuum
electromagnetic  zero-point  radiation.    The  present  analysis  demonstrates  that  forces  induced  on  matter  by
zero-point radiation arise in addition to gravitational forces.  It is argued that zero-point radiation should be
red-shifted  near  large  gravitational  sources  while  remaining  essentially  undetectable  within  freely  falling
reference frames.  On this basis, an effective weight of an observer stationed near the surface of the Earth is
derived for the case when zero-point radiation is present.  It is then argued that the weight of matter may be
affected by altering the gravitational anisotropy of zero-point radiation.

1.  Introduction

In recent times, there have been several attempts to shed greater insight into the origin of inertial and

gravitational forces.  According to one recent proposal, inertial and gravitational forces alike arise entirely

due  to  an  interaction  between  vacuum  electromagnetic  zero-point  radiation  and  subatomic  particles

comprising  ordinary  matter  [1].    For  the  case  of  inertia,  this  proposal  suggests  that  when  an  object

accelerates  through  the  zero-point  radiation  field  (ZPF),  pervading  all  of  space,  the  quarks  and  electrons

comprising the object scatter a portion of the radiation passing through the object.  This in turn exerts an

electromagnetic drag force on the object, which, according to this ZPF proposal, can be associated with the

object’s inertia.  Additionally, those who support the ZPF proposal also seek to ascribe gravitation entirely

to  interaction  with  zero-point  radiation.    However,  such  an  approach  is  certainly  not  without  conceptual

difficulties.

One source of difficulty surrounds the question of what percentage of the force on an object is actually

ZPF induced.  This question seems to be hinged on the origin of the rest mass-energy of matter.  According

to  the  ZPF  proposal,  the  energy  content  of  matter  is  entirely  internal  kinetic  energy  due  to  ZPF-induced

jittering motion, or zitterbewegung [1], of quarks and electrons comprising ordinary matter.  As pointed out

in  [2],  however,  ascribing  the  energy  content  of  subatomic  particles  entirely  to  internal  kinetic  energy

effectively neglects the rest mass-energy content of these particles.  It is straightforward to see that quarks

and  electrons  each  possess  charge  and  spin,  and  hence  are  each  surrounded  by  an  electromagnetic  field.

These electromagnetic fields possess energy.  Therefore, while ZPF-induced zitterbewegung must certainly

give  rise  to  kinetic  energy  of  quarks  and  electrons,  such  particles  also  possess  intrinsic  quantities  of  rest

mass-energy due at least in part to their electromagnetic fields.

Another seemingly important issue is the space-time curvature, or distortion, existing near gravitational

sources.  The ZPF proposal appears to do away with the notion of space-time distortion, opting in favor of

electrodynamic  properties  of  space-time.    One  example  of  this  can  be  seen  in  an  attempt  to  explain  the

gravitational bending of light near gravitational sources by ascribing variable dielectric properties to space

[1].  In essence, the ZPF proposal treats space as a polarizable vacuum.  As is very well known, however,

general relativity predicts that space and time intervals are affected by the presence of gravitating matter.  It

1

is difficult to imagine how the ZPF proposal can account for the well-documented dilation of time arising

near gravitational sources [5].  In our opinion it is precisely the behavior of space-time predicted by general

relativity that gives rise to inertial and gravitational forces.

In previous analyses,  we  have used special and general relativity  to  demonstrate  that  inertia  is  purely

relativistic in origin [2].  Specifically, for the case of inertia, we have shown that a force-producing agent

who exerts a constant force on an object experiences a reactive force of the form

= −

∇∇∇∇

f




(1)

wherein  E  is  the  total  energy  content  of  the  object,  dτ   is  an  interval  of  proper  time  experienced  by  the

accelerating object, and  dt  is a corresponding interval of time experienced by the force-producing agent.

Using this expression, it has been further shown that ZPF-induced forces acting on accelerating matter arise

in addition to the intrinsic inertial properties of matter [2].  The present analysis uses the same approach for

the case of ZPF-forces induced due to gravitation.  Herein it is demonstrated that gravitationally induced

ZPF-forces acting on an observer residing near a gravitational source arise in addition to the gravitational

force due to the intrinsic energy content of the observer and the source.

One noteworthy point to notice is that electromagnetic zero-point radiation possesses energy.  Thus, it

makes sense that zero-point radiation must be subject to gravitation just as are other forms of energy, and

so one would expect the ZPF to be red-shifted near large gravitational sources.  Such a red-shift ought to

arise  simply  because  gravitational  space-time  curvature  gives  rise  to  anisotropy  in  the  electromagnetic

mode  structure  of  the  ZPF.    Additionally,  electromagnetic  zero-point  radiation  is  Lorentz  invariant  [1],

which  suggests  that  zero-point  radiation  should  be  essentially  uniformly  distributed  within  freely  falling

reference frames.  Based on this line of reasoning, we suspect that the ZPF should exert some level of force

on an  observer  stationed  near  a  gravitational  source,  while  remaining  substantially  undetectable  to  freely

falling observers.  This observation is used herein to demonstrate that ZPF-induced forces act in addition to

gravitational forces.

In the next Section, an effective weight is derived for the case of an observer stationed near the Earth in

the  presence  of  zero-point  radiation.    The  resulting  expression  for  the  observer’s  weight  contains  three

terms.  The first term is the usual Newtonian expression  for the  gravitational  force between two  massive

bodies.  The second term is a body force acting on the observer due to interaction with zero-point radiation.

The third term is a gravitational force arising due to other forms of energy that may be present, such as due

to  the  small  and  weak  forces  within  the  observer.    Based  on  this  expression,  it  is  concluded  that

gravitationally induced ZPF-forces on  matter  are  additional  body  forces  that  contribute  to  the  observable

weight of ordinary matter.

In Section 3, it is argued that zero-point radiation  may be  manipulated to create observable forces on

material  objects.    It  is  pointed  out  that  since  zero-point  radiation  is  electromagnetic  in  origin,  and

contributes to the weight of matter, it may in fact be possible to alter the effective weight of matter through

2

electromagnetic  manipulation  of  the  ZPF.    The  key  to  doing  this  appears  to  be  to  alter  the  gravitational

anisotropy of the electromagnetic mode structure of the ZPF [6].  To illustrate this, the expression for the

effective  weight  derived  in  Section  2  is  considered.    It  is  argued  that  a  local  manipulation  of  the

gravitational anisotropy of zero-point radiation correspondingly alters the quantity of passive gravitational

energy imparted to the observer, which in turn affects the effective weight of the observer.

2.  Weight due to Gravitational Anisotropy of Zero-Point Radiation

As pointed out in the Introduction, electromagnetic zero-point radiation does not exert forces on bodies

undergoing  free-fall  motion  simply  because  such  radiation  is  uniformly  distributed  within  freely  falling

reference frames.  This is not the case, however, when an object is held stationary near a large gravitational

source.  The reference frame of such an object is non-inertial, and so all modes comprising the zero-point

field (ZPF) are gravitationally red-shifted.  This anisotropy in the mode structure of the ZPF must give rise

to some level of force on the stationary object [1].  However, as shown herein, such a ZPF-induced force

necessarily arises in addition to the gravitational force on the object.

Let  an  observer,  of  proper  mass  m,  be  stationed  a  distance  r  from  the  center  of  a  weak  gravitational

source such as the Earth.  Within the stationary reference frame of the observer, the ZPF is observably red-

shifted  due  to  space-time  distortion  near  the  Earth.    According  to  the  reasoning  presented  in  the

Introduction, such a red-shift of the ZPF gives rise to a body force on the observer, which acts in addition

to the gravitational force on the observer [2].  According to [2], the total force acting on the observer may

be expressed in the form

where  E′  is the total energy content of the observer, and  dt dτ  is a scalar function that characterizes the

gravitational distortion of space-time near the Earth.  One important point to notice is that  E′  represents all

forms of energy possessed by the observer, and is not limited to merely the ZPF-induced energy.  Thus, the

total energy content of the observer must be expressed as 

E

  is  the  internal  ZPF-induced  kinetic  energy  of  the  subatomic  particles

comprising the observer, and U includes additional forms of energy that may be possessed by the observer,

such as due to the strong and weak forces.  Using this expression for the energy content of the observer, Eq.

(2) can be recast in the form

The sum enclosed within parentheses makes it clear that the interaction between  zero-point radiation and

the  subatomic  particles  comprising  the  observer  contributes  positively  to  the  passive  gravitational  mass-

energy of the observer.

In order to evaluate Eq. (3), an expression for the scalar function  dt dτ  must  first be derived.  As is

very  well  known,  the  geometry  of  space-time  exterior  to  a  large  spherical  source  is  described  by  the

Schwarzschild coordinate system, having a space-time interval of the form

wherein  dτ  is an interval of proper time experienced by the stationary observer and  dt  is an interval of

This is the effective weight of an observer stationed near the Earth in the presence of zero-point radiation.

The first term is easily identified as the usual Newtonian expression for the gravitational force between two

massive  bodies.    The  second  term  is  an  additional  force  on  the  observer  arising  due  to  gravitationally

induced  scattering  of  zero-point  radiation.    The  third  term  arises  due  to  additional  forms  of  energy  with

which  the  observer  may  be  endowed,  such  as  due  to  the  strong  and  weak  forces.    The  Newtonian  force

arises  simply  because  both  the  observer  and  the  source  possess  intrinsic  gravitational  mass-energy.    The

force due to zero-point radiation is clearly an additional downward-acting body force that contributes to the

measurable  weight  of  the  stationary  observer.    It  is  straightforward  to  see  that  if  the  gravitational  mass-

energy of the observer and source were strictly ZPF-induced, then the first and last terms in Eq. (10) would

be zero, and the force would then be described solely by the second term.  This is precisely the objective of

those  who  support  the  ZPF  proposal.    However,  without  experimental  evidence  it  must  be  presently

concluded  that  gravitationally  induced  ZPF-forces  are  additional  forces  that  contribute  to  the  observable

weight of ordinary matter.

3.  Affecting Weight Through Manipulation of Zero-Point Radiation

In the preceding  Section,  it  was  shown  that  zero-point  radiation  exerts  additional  forces  on  observers

stationed  near  gravitational  sources.    Such  gravitationally  induced  ZPF-forces  increase  the  observable

weights of such observers.  With that in mind, it seems that the next natural question to ask is can the ZPF

be  manipulated  in  such  a  manner  that  ZPF-induced  forces  act  in  opposition  to  gravitational  forces?

According  to  [6],  both  gravitational  and  inertial  forces  alike  may  be  affected  by  altering  the

electromagnetic  mode  structure  of  the  ZPF.    This  suggests  that  ZPF-induced  forces  may  be  affected

through  electromagnetic  means.    As  pointed  out  in  the  preceding  Section,  the  ZPF  contributes  to  the

passive  gravitational  energy  content  of  stationary  observers  simply  because  the  ZPF  is  anisotropic  in  the

non-inertial  frames  of  those  observers.    It  is  not  difficult  to  imagine  that  some  sort  of  electromagnetic

process  might  be  performed  that  counteracts  the  gravitationally  induced  anisotropy  of  the  ZPF.    More

5

specifically, if the anisotropy of the ZPF were annulled or at least substantially reduced within a region in

which a stationary observer resides, near a gravitational source, the energy contributed to the observer due

to  zero-point  radiation  would  be  substantially  reduced,  as  well.    Assuming  that  such  an  alteration  can

indeed be carried out, it is straightforward to see that in the limit as the  ZPF-induced force tends  toward

zero, Eq. (10) reduces to

= −

f

GMm

(11)

(12)

This implies that when the ZPF is affected in such a  manner that it imparts zero energy  to the stationary

observer, the force on the observer should reduce to a purely gravitational force.  Continuing along these

lines, it can be further imagined that through some process the ZPF might be affected to such an extent that

the gravitational anisotropy of zero-point radiation becomes inverted, thus occurring in a direction opposite

to  that  normally  caused  by  gravitation.    The  passive  gravitational  energy  imparted  to  the  observer  then

becomes negative, and Eq. (10) assumes the form

The force given by the second term in this expression clearly acts in opposition to the purely gravitational

forces given by the first and third terms.  This implies that when the ZPF is altered so that the ZPF-induced

force  acts  upward,  the  weight  of  the  stationary  observer  should  appear  somewhat  smaller  than  when  the

ZPF  is  unaltered.    Clearly  then,  as  the  alteration  in  the  anisotropy  of  the  ZPF  is  further  inverted,  the

observable  weight  of  the  stationary  observer  should  be  further  decreased,  as  well.    Based  on  this  line  of

reasoning, when the ZPF is manipulated to such an extent that the resulting ZPF-induced force is equal, but

oppositely directed, to the downward gravitation force, the observable weight of the observer should drop

to zero.

The next natural question to ask is how can such an alteration of the ZPF be carried out?  One possible

answer  may  be  found  in  [7]  wherein  it  was  shown  that  when  the  ZPF  performs  positive  electromagnetic

work within a localized region, the energy density of that region appears negative relative to the rest of the

universe.    More  simply  stated,  when  the  ZPF  performs  positive  work,  the  energy  density  of  the  ZPF

decreases.    Based  on  this,  it  is  not  difficult  to  speculate  that  any  process  through  which  the  ZPF  is

compelled to perform positive work may alter the local field geometry of the ZPF.  And with certain field

configurations [7], it just may be possible to manipulate the weights of material objects.

One  problem,  however,  is  that  the  ZPF  comprises  an  infinite  number  of  electromagnetic  frequency

modes  [1].    At  first  thought,  this  seems  to  imply  that  an  unmanageably  large  number  of  modes  must  be

altered in order to affect the ZPF.  But this may not necessarily be the case.  A very interesting discussion

given by [8] proposes that drawing energy from lower frequency modes of the ZPF may cause energy to

flow  down  the  spectrum  from  the  higher  frequency  modes.    This  seems  to  suggest  that  if,  through  some

6

process, the low frequency portion of the ZPF can be set into performing work, then the higher frequency

portion  may  be  affected  as  well,  thereby  altering  a  substantial  portion  of  the  ZPF  spectrum.    Such  an

approach may be the key to successfully manipulating the zero-point field mode structure.

As  a  final  thought,  it  is  interesting  to  ponder  the  work  of  Podkletnov  and  Nieminen  [9]  wherein  a

levitating  superconducting  ring  was  alleged  to  have  reduced  the  weights  of  objects  suspended  above  the

ring.  It  may be that the superconducting ring somehow came into interaction  with a portion of the ZPF,

causing the ZPF to perform work, and thereby reducing the gravitational anisotropy of the ZPF above the

ring.  If the superconducting ring did indeed bring about a small reduction of the anisotropy  of  the  ZPF,

then  the  weights  of  objects  placed  above  the  ring  should  appear  slightly  smaller  than  when  weighed

elsewhere.  According to Podkletnov and Nieminen [9], such a minute weight-shift was indeed observed; a

5.47834-g  sample  was  observed  to  loose  between  0.05%  and  2.0%  of  its  weight  when  placed  above  the

levitating  superconducting  ring.    It  would  be  interesting  to  see  if  this  small  weight-shift  can  be  derived

solely on the basis of ZPF theory.

4.  Discussion

A  recent  proposal  asserts  that  the  origin  of  gravitational  forces  is  an  interaction  between  the  vacuum

electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) and the subatomic particles comprising ordinary matter [1].  On the

contrary, the present analysis has argued that zero-point radiation is not the source of gravitation, but rather

that ZPF-induced forces comprise additional gravitationally induced forces on matter.  To demonstrate this,

an expression for the effective weight of an observer stationed near the Earth in the presence of zero-point

radiation  was  derived.    The  derivation  was  performed  on  the  basis  that  since  zero-point  radiation  is

electromagnetic,  the  ZPF  is  red-shifted  near  gravitational  sources  while  remaining  undetectable  in  the

inertial reference frames of free fall observers.  The resulting expression for the effective weight suggests

that  gravitationally  induced  ZPF-forces  act  in  addition  to  gravitational  forces,  thereby  increasing  the

weights of stationary observers.

Of  particular  interest  was  the  question  as  to  whether  the  weights  of  material  objects  may  be  affected

through  manipulation  of  zero-point  radiation.    It  was  argued  that  such  a  task  might  be  carried  out  by

somehow  altering  the  gravitationally  induced  anisotropy  of  zero-point  radiation  [6].    Altering  the

anisotropy  of  zero-point  radiation  within  a  localized  region  necessarily  alters  the  interaction  energy

imparted to observers residing within that region.  This in turn affects the magnitude of ZPF-induced forces

on those observers.  It was argued that reducing the gravitational anisotropy of the ZPF in the presence of a

stationary observer, residing near a gravitational source, may give rise to a corresponding reduction in the

observable weight of the observer.  In closing, the observations of Podkletnov and Nieminen [9] were cited

as one example in which a reduction of the gravitational anisotropy of zero-point radiation may have been

successfully achieved.

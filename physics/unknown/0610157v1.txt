Abstract 
 
We propose a new turbulence closure model based on the budget equations for the basic 
second moments: turbulent kinetic and potential energies: TKE and TPE, which comprise 
the turbulent total energy: TTE = TKE + TPE; and vertical turbulent fluxes of momentum 
and  buoyancy  (potential  temperature).  Besides  the  new  concept  of  the  TTE,  other  key 
points are: non-gradient correction to the traditional formulation for the flux of buoyancy 
(potential temperature), and advanced analysis of the stability dependence of anisotropy 
of  turbulence.  The  proposed  model  affords  the  existence  of  turbulence  at  any  gradient 
Richardson number, Ri. Instead of the critical value of Ri separating the turbulent and the 
laminar  regimes,  the  model  includes  its  threshold  value,  between  0.2  and  0.3,  which 
separates  two  turbulent  regimes  of  essentially  different  nature:  fully  developed,  chaotic 
turbulence  at  low  Ri  and  weak,  strongly  anisotropic  turbulence  at  large  Ri.  Predictions 
from  the  proposed  model  are  consistent  with  available  data  from  atmospheric  and  lab 
experiments, DNS and LES. 

 
 
 

 1. Introduction 
 
Most  of  the  practically  used  turbulence  closure  models  are  based  on  the  concept  of  the 
down-gradient  transport.  Accordingly  they  express  turbulent  fluxes  of  momentum  and 
scalars  as  products  of  the  mean  gradient  of  the  transported  property  and  the 
corresponding  turbulent  transport  coefficient  (eddy  viscosity, 
,  heat  conductivity, 
). Following Kolmogorov (1941), the latter are taken proportional 
HK
to the turbulent velocity scale, 
 

, and length scale,

This  approach  is  justified  when  applied  to  the  neutral-stability  flows  (where 
taken proportional to the distance form the nearest wall).  
 
However, it faces difficulties in stratified flows (both stable and unstable). The turbulent 
Prandtl  number 
  exhibits  essential  dependence  on  the  stratification  and 
cannot  be  considered  as  constant.  Next,  as  follows  from  the  budget  equations  for  the

why  the  traditional  formula 
becomes  insufficiently  accurate  because  of  essential  stability  dependence  of  the 
anisotropy of turbulence 
z  decreases with increasing stability. In view of

these  problems,  it  is  often  assumed  that  the  turbulent  length  scales  for  the  momentum, 
,  are  essentially  different.  As  a  result  the  above  closure  scheme

only in this case) obviously loses its elegance and constructiveness: the unsolved part of

the problem is simply displaced from { M ,
becomes insufficient to determine additional unknown parameters.  
 
Numerous  alternative  turbulence  closures  were  formulated  using  equations  for  other 
turbulent  parameters  (besides  TKE)  together  with  heuristic  hypotheses  and  empirical 
relationships,  but  no  consensus  is  still  achieved;  see  overviews  by  Weng  and  Taylor 
(2002), and Umlauf and Burchard (2005).

In this paper we analyse the effects of the density stratification on the turbulent energies 
and  vertical  turbulent  fluxes  in  the  stably  stratified  atmospheric  (or  oceanic)  boundary-
layer flows, in which the horizontal variations of the mean velocity and temperature are 
much weaker than the vertical variations. The proposed theory provides realistic stability 
dependencies  of  the  turbulent  Prandtl  number,  the  vertical  anisotropy,  and  the  vertical 
turbulent length scale. Below we present material in meteorological terms, but all results 
can be easily reformulated in terms of water currents in the ocean or lakes, expressing the 
buoyancy through the temperature and salinity instead of the temperature and humidity.  
 
We consider a minimal set of the budget equations for the second order moments, namely 
those  for  the  vertical  fluxes  of  buoyancy  (proportional  to  potential  temperature)  and 
momentum, the TKE and the turbulent potential energy, TPE (shown to be proportional 
to the mean squared potential temperature fluctuation). In these equations we account for 
some  usually  neglected  features  but  leave  more  detailed  treatment  of  the  third-order 
transports  and  the  pressure-velocity  correlations  for  future  analysis.  In  particular,  we 
advance  the  familiar  “return  to  isotropy”  model  to  more  realistically  determine  the 
stability  dependence  of  the  vertical  anisotropy, 
,  and  introduce  a  non-gradient 
correction to the traditional, down-gradient formulation for the turbulent flux of potential 
temperature.  This  approach  allows  deriving  a  reasonably  simple  turbulence  closure 
scheme including realistic energy budgets and stability dependence of 
 
We introduce a concept of the total (kinetic + potential) turbulent energy (TTE), derive 
the TTE budget equation, and demonstrate that the TTE in stably stratified sheared flows 
does not completely decay even in very strong static stability. This conclusion, deduced 
from  the  general  equations  independently  of  the  concrete  formulation  for  the  turbulent 
length  scale,  argues  against  the  widely  recognised  concept  of  the  critical  Richardson 
number.  
 
Recall  that  the  Richardson  number,  Ri,  is  defined  as  the  squared  ratio  of  the  Brunt-
Väisälä frequency, ℵ , to the velocity shear, S:

 is a reference value of 
the  absolute  temperature.  As  proposed  by  Richardson  (1920),  it  quantifies  the  effect  of 
static  stability  on  turbulence.  Since  that  time,  a  principal  question  “whether  or  not  the 
turbulence  can  be  maintained  by  the  velocity  shear  at  very  large  Richardson  numbers” 
has been the focus of attention in the theory of stably stratified turbulent flows.  
 
A  widely  recognised  opinion  is  that  turbulence  decays  when  Ri  exceeds  some  critical 
value,  Ric  (with  the  frequently  quoted  estimate  of  Ric=0.25).  However,  the  concept  of

critical Ri was neither rigorously derived from basic physical principles nor demonstrated 
empirically.  Just  opposite,  it  contradicts  to  long  standing  experimental  evidence  (see 
detailed discussion in Zilitinkevich et al., 2006).  
 
It  worth  emphasising  that  turbulence  closure  models  based  on  the  straightforward 
application of the TKE budget equation and Kolmogorov’s closure hypotheses, Eqs. (1.1) 
and (1.2), do imply the existence of Ric. In practical atmospheric modelling such closures 
are  not  acceptable.  In  particular,  they  lead  to  unrealistic  decoupling  of  the  atmosphere 
from  the  underlying  surface  in  each  case  when  Ri  in  the  surface  layer  exceeds  Ric.  To 
avoid  this  drawback,  turbulence  closures  in  operational  use  are  equipped  with  special 
correction-functions,  e.g.  those  specifying 
  as  a  function  of  Ri,  in  order  to  prevent 
TPr
c and by these means to achieve better model performance. Usually these 
appearing of Ri
correction  functions  are  not  derived  in  the  context  of  the  closure  in  use,  but  either 
determined  empirically  or  taken  from  independent  theories.  Using  this  trick,  modellers 
close  eyes  on  the  obvious  fact  that  corrections  could  be  inconsistent  with  hypotheses 
underlying the basic closure.

We  also  assume  that  the  vertical  scale  of  motions  (limited  to  the  height  scale  of  the

the mean flow vertical velocity is typically much smaller than the horizontal velocity.  In

3. Turbulent energies 

 
Consider, first, the concept of turbulent potential energy (TPE). Using the state equation 
and  the  hydrostatic  equation,  the  density  and  the  buoyancy  in  the  atmosphere  are 
expressed  through  the  potential  temperature, θ,  and  specific  humidity,  q  (in  the  ocean, 
through  θ  and  salinity,  s).  These  variables  are  adiabatic  invariants  conserved  in  the 
vertically  displaced  portions  of  fluid,  so  that  the  density  is  also  conserved.  This  allows 
calculating  its  fluctuation:  ρ′ =(
∂ /ρ ) zδ   and  the  fluctuation  of  potential  energy  per 
unit mass:

For certainty, we consider the thermally stratified atmosphere, where the buoyancy, b, is 
expressed through the potential temperature: b=βθ. It follows that the turbulent potential 
energy (TPE) is proportional to the energy of the potential temperature fluctuations:

Then multiplying Eq. (2.5) by

 is the TTE flux divergence. It follows that the TKE production (the 

 
where 
first term on the r.h.s.) is completely controlled by the velocity shears.  
 
As follows from Eq. (3.5), the TTE in the presence of shear never decays. At the same 
time  the  TKE  cannot  completely  decay  in  the  presence  of  the  TPE:  indeed  if  the  TKE 
decays, a part of the TPE would inevitably convert into the TKE. This reasoning leaves 
no room for the concept of the critical Richardson number.  
 
Traditional  analyses  of  the  turbulent  energy  were  basically  limited  to  the  TKE  budget, 
Eq. (2.4); whereas Eq. (2.5) for the squared potential temperature fluctuations, although 
well-known  over  decades,  was  practically  ignored  in  the  literature  on  the  turbulence 
closure problem.  
 
  was  treated  in  terms  of  the  turbulent  potential  energy

(TPE)  by  Hunt  et  al.  (1988),  Schumann  and  Gerz  (1995),    Hanazaki  and  Hunt  (1996, 
2004), Keller and van Atta (2000), Stretch et al. (2001), Luyten et al. (2002, p. 257) and 
Rehmann and Hwang (2005).  
 
Zilitinkevich (2002) employed the TKE and the TPE budget equations on equal terms to 
derive  an  energetically  consistent  turbulent  closure  model  avoiding  the  traditional 
hypothesis 
 

 (that leads to dead end, at least in the stable stratification).

4.1. ANISOTROPY OF TURBULENCE 

 
In this section we consider the equilibrium turbulence regime and neglect the third-order 
transport  terms,  so  that  the  left  hand  sides  (l.h.s.)  in  all  budget  equations  become  zero; 
and limit our analysis to the boundary-layer type flows, in which the horizontal gradients 
of the mean velocity and temperature are negligibly small. These are just the conditions, 
at which the TKE production rate becomes

It goes without saying that 
in  particular  in  the  wave  boundary  layer  below  the  ocean  surface  or  in  the  capping 
inversion layer above the long-lived atmospheric stable boundary layer, where the TKE is 
at least partially produced by breaking of the surface waves in water or internal gravity 
waves  in  the  atmosphere  (these  mechanisms  are  more  close  to  the  oscillating-grid 
generation of turbulence rather than to its shear generation).

To  determine  empirical  dimensionless  constants 
we compare results from the local closure model given in Section 4 with experimental,

Recall  th   the  local  m
odel  in  question  (in  contrast  to  the  more  general  model  given  in 
Section 6) is applied to the homogeneous turbulence and does not include transports of 
turbulent  energies  and  turbulent  fluxes.  At  the  same  time  practically  all  currently 
available  data  represent  vertically  (in  a  number  of  cases,  vertically  and  horizontally) 
heterogeneous flows, in which the above transports are more or less pronounced. In these

It  follows  that  our  model  –  as  applied  to  the  steady-state,  homogeneous  regime  in  the 
urface layer – is consistent with the Monin and Obukhov (1954) similarity theory. Given

We  emphasise  that  the  above  algebraic  closure  model  is  applicable  only  to  the 
homogeneous  turbulence  regimes.  Therefore  it  probably  serves  as  a  reasonable 
approximation  for  the  nocturnal  ABLs  separated  from  the  free  flow  by  the  neutrally 
stratified residual layers, but not for the conventionally neutral and the long-lived stable 
ABLs, which develop against the stably stratified free flow and exhibit essentially non-
local  features  such  as  the  distant  effect  of  the  free-flow  stability  on  the  surface-layer 
tu
rbulence  (see  Zilitinkevich,  2002;  Zilitinkevich  and  Esau,  2005).  To  reproduce  these

a
Section.  
 
 

ulence  closure  model  should  take  in

the  Monin-Obukhov  similarity

6. Non-local model 

 
It  goes  without  saying  that  a  consistent  turbulence  closure  model  must  keep  physical 
sense  and  give  correct  results  in  the  equilibrium,  steady-state,  homogeneous  regime  of 
turbulence when the non-stationary, the mean-flow transport and the third-order-turbulent 
transport terms in the budget equations for the second moments becom
e zero. Only with 
is  proviso  it  makes  sense  to  proceed  further  and  to  apply  more  general  forms  of  the 
th
closure equations to more complicated, non-steady turbulent regimes, accounting for the 
turbulence of non-local origin6. In this section we summarise basic results from the above 
analyses to formulate a non-local closure scheme satisfying this requirement and reducing 
to the local algebraic closure considered in Sections 4 and 5.  
 

                                                          
 
6 This requirement (although quite trivial) is sometimes overlooked. For example, the budget equation for 
 closure (where K stands for the 
the TKE dissipation rate, that is the key equation in the widely used 
TKE  and  ε,  for  its  dissipation  rate),  in  the  vertically  homogeneous,  steady-sate,  neutral-stratification 
regime becomes obviously inconsistent with the firmly established TKE budget equation also employed in 
this closure [confer mutually contradicting Equations (2.48) and (2.49) in the textbook of Rodi (1993)].  

ε−K

Clearly, this local closure (as any other local closure) does not include energy transports 
and inevitably predicts too small (or even zero) values of the TKE in the regions of flow 
where the mean shear, S, diminishes, e.g., at the axes of jets where S =0; or in capping 
in
versions  in  the  uppermost  parts  of  atmospheric  boundary  layers,  where  the  Brunt-
Väisälä  frequency  (cid:0)   is  very  large  and  S  is  small,  whereas  the  TKE  could  be  quite 
aced 
pronounced  due  to  its  turbulent-diffusion  transport  from  the  stron sh
much below. Nearly all atmospheric data on turbulence at very large Ri are obtained just 
fro
ents in capping inversions. Algebraic closures are not quite applicable to 
m m
these data.

7  We  leave  for  future  work  more  accurate  treatment  of  third-order  fluxes.  Besides  turbulent  diffusion, 
modelled here through Eqs. (6.1)-(6.2), the third-order fluxes include vertical transports caused by internal 
gravity  waves.  A  simple  model  of  the  wave-induced  fluxes  of  the  TKE  and  TPE  in  the  conventionally 
neutral and long-lived ABLs was proposed by Zilitinkevich (2002).

8 However, over the sea surface a part of the atmospheric TKE is transferred into the energy of the surface 
waves, so that the vertical flux of the TKE through the water surface is non-zero. To a first approximation 
this  flux  is  taken  proportional  to  the  cubed  friction  velocity  (e.g.  Kitaigorodskii,  1970).  Hence,  the  TTE 
budget is generally non-local, and the lower boundary condition given by Eq. (6.9) becomes questionable. 
The similar situation occurs over the vegetated or urban canopies, because a part of the TKE is transferred 
into the energy of vibration of “roughness elements”.

determine  zl  and then, to the first sight, the closure problem is solved.  
 
Such  conclusion  is  premature.  The  concepts  of  down-gradient  turbulent  transport  and 
turbulent exchange coefficients, as well as relationships like

are  consistent  with  the  flux-budget  equations  only  in  comparatively  simple  particular 
cases  relevant  to  the  steady-state  homogeneous  regime  of  turbulence.  Only  in  these 
conditions  turbulent  exchange  coefficients  can  be  rigorously  defined,  in  contrast  to 
turbulent fluxes that represent clearly 
ed, measurable parameters, governed by flux-
udget  equations.  It  is  therefore  preferable  to  rely  on  the  flux-budget  equations  rather

than to formulate hypotheses about virtual exchange coefficients. Furthermore, the TKE

zE , rather than 

mention  that  the  vertical  turbulent  transports  are  controlled  by  the  energy  of  vertical 
velocity fluctuations, 
 
In view of the above reasoning we do not follow the above “main stream”. Instead of the 
sole  use  of  the  TKE  budget  equation,  we  introduce  the  concepts  of  turbulent  potential 
energy  (TPE)  and  turbulent  total  energy  (TTE  =  TKE  +  TPE);  and  employ  budget 
equations  for  both  TKE  and  TPE,  which  guarantees  maintaining  of  turbulence  by  the 
velocity shear in any stratification.  
 
Furthermore, instead of the concept of down-gradient turbulent fluxes implying universal 
existence  of  turbulent  exchange  coefficients,  we  employ  budget  equations  for  the 
turbulent  fluxes  and,  only  when  it  is  physically  grounded  –  in  the  steady-state 
homogeneous  regime  –  d
erive  new  formulations  for  these  coefficients.  In  the  budget 
equation  for  the  vertical  flux  of  potential  temperature  we  take  into  account  a  crucially 
important mechanism: generation of the counter-gradient flux due to the buoyancy effect 
of  potential-temperature  fluctuations  compensated  only  partially  by  the  correlation 
between  the  potential-temperature  and  the  pressure-gradient  fluctuations.  We  show  that 
this is just the mechanism responsible for the principle difference between the heat- and 
the momentum-transfer.  
 
To  determine  the  energy  of  vertical  velocity  fluctuations,  we  modify  the  traditional 
return-to-isotropy  formulation  accounting  for  the  effect  of  stratification  on  the 
redistribution  of  the  TKE  between  horizontal  and  ver
tical  velocity  components.  And 
finally, we validate our closure model for the steady-state, homogeneous regime against 
available experimental, LES and DNS data. We also propose a non-local version of our 
 plan 
closure employing the turbulent diffusion approximation for the third mome

by  internal  waves)  but  also  its  reasonable  simplification  –  to  make  the  closure  model

majority  of  data  disclose  two  essentially  different  regimes  of  turbulence  separated  by 
quite sharp transition in a narrow interval of Ri around Ri ~ 0.25 (shown in the figures by

vertical dashed lines). On both sides of this interval the ratios 
 
approach  plateaus,  corresponding  to  very  high  and  very  low  efficiency  of  turbulent 
transports. 
 
It  is  hardly  accidental  that  the  above  threshold  practically  coincides  with  the  critical 
 number, Ric, derived from the classical perturbation analyses. The latter have 
Richardson
demonstrated  that  the  infinitesimal  perturbations  grow  exponentially  at  Ri  <  Ric  but  do 
not grow at Ri > Ric when, as we understand now, the onset of turbulent events requires 
finite  perturbations  [for  details  see  Zilitinkevich  et  al.  (2006)].  It  follows  that  the

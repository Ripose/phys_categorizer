Abstract:  The  analysis  of  the  Pioneer  10  and  11  data  demonstrated  the  presence  of  an  anomalous  Doppler 
frequency blue-shift drift which is interpreted as an anomalous acceleration. The Doppler frequency dirft follows 
by  considering  the  motions  of  the  Pioneers  in  the  universe,  i.e.  it  is  of  cosmological  origin.  There  is  no 
anomalous acceleration. 
 
   1. Introduction 
There  are  many  papers  confirming  an  anomalous  Doppler  frequency  blue-shift  drift  of  the  Pioneers  (see  e.g. 
Anderson  et  al.  [1],  Markwardt  [2],  Truyshev  et  al.  [3],  etc.).  Generally  it  is  interpreted  as  an  anomalous 
acceleration of the spacecrafts. But it is difficult to explain this anomalous acceleration with standard physics. 
In  this  paper  it  is  shown  that  the  motion  of  the  spacecrafts  must  be  studied  in  the  universe.    The  Doppler 
frequency drift follows by a nonlinear variation of time in the universe for the observer, i.e. it is of cosmological 
origin and there is no anomalous acceleration of the spacecrafts. 
 
   2. Summary of some Results 
Let us start from a theory of gravitation in flat space-time studied in several papers (see e.g. [4]). A summary of 
the theory with applications can be found in paper [5] where references to the detailed studies are stated. 
Subsequently, we summarize some results of paper [6] which are used in the following.  
The flat space-time theory of gravitation has a flat space-time background metric 
                                                      (
The gravitational field is desrcibed  by symmetrc tensor 

ijg  satisfying covariant (with respect to the flat space-
time metric (2.1)) differential equations of order two where the source of the field is the total energy-momentum 
tensor inclusive the gravitational field.The proper time (atomic time) is defined by

The application of the theory to homogeneous, isotropic, cosmological models starts with the pseudo-Euclidean 
geometry, i.e. 
                                                       (

                                                                                (2.1)

   3. Explanation of the Doppler Frequency Drift 
In paper [6] an explanation of an anomalous acceleration of spacecrafts has been given by the use of equation 
(2.10).  But  the  authors  of  the  papers  [1-3]  measure  a  Doppler  frequency  drift  which  is  interpreted  as  an 
anomalous  acceleration.  Furthermore,  an  observer  uses  not  the  time  t   defined  by  the  pseudo-Euclidean 
background geometry (2.3). This follows from the following considerations. Assume that a light ray at an object 
with distance  r  from the observer is emitted at time  et  and arrives at time  at  at the observer. It follows from 
(2.2) by the use of (2.5)

Let us consider the relation (3.1) for two different light rays emitted at

Hence, the total Doppler frequency drift (3.11) in the universe is by the use of (3.12) and (3.13) with (3.16) about 
zero.  Therefore,  the  measured  frequency  drift  does  not  imply  an  anomalous  acceleration  but  follows  by 
considering the energy of the photons in the universe, i.e. it is of cosmological origin.

Abstract 

We consider phononic heat transport through molecular chains connecting two thermal 

reservoirs.  For  relatively  short  molecules  at  normal  temperatures  we  find,  using 

classical stochastic simulations, that heat conduction is dominated by the harmonic part 

of  the  molecular  force-field.  We  develop  a  general  theory  for  the  heat  conduction 

through  harmonic  chains  in  3-dimensions.  Our  approach  uses  the  standard  formalism 

that leads to the generalized Langevin equation for a system coupled to a harmonic heat 

bath, however the driving and relaxation terms are considered separately in a way that 

leads  directly  to  the  steady  state  response  and  the  heat  current  under  non-equilibrium 

driving. A Landauer-type expression for the heat conduction is obtained, in agreement 

with other recent studies. We used this general formalism to study the heat conduction 

properties of alkane. We find that for relatively short (1-30 carbon molecules) the length 

and temperature dependence of the molecular heat conduction results from the balance 

of  three  factors:  (i)  The  molecular  frequency  spectrum  in  relation  to  the  frequency 

cutoff of the thermal reservoirs, (ii) the degree of localization of the molecular normal 

modes and (iii) the molecule-heat reservoirs coupling. The fact that molecular modes at 

different frequency regimes have different localization properties gives rise to intricate 

dependence  of  the  heat  conduction  on  molecular  length  at  different  temperature.  For 

example, the heat conduction increases with molecular length for short molecular chains 

at low temperatures. Isotopically substituted disordered chains are also studied and their 

behavior  can  be  traced  to  the  above  factors  together  with  the  increased  mode 

localization in disordered chain and the increase in the density of low frequency modes 

associated  with  heavier  mass  substitution.  Finally,  we  compare  the  heat  conduction 

obtained  from  this  microscopic  calculation  to  that  estimated  by  considering  the 

molecule  as  a  cylinder  characterized  by  a  macroscopic  heat  conduction  typical  to

organic  solids.  We  find  that  this  classical  model  overestimates  the  heat  conduction  of 

single  alkane  molecules  by  about  an  order  of  magnitude  at  room  temperature. 

Implications  of  the  present  study  to  the  problem  of  heating  in  electrically  conducting 

molecular junctions are pointed out.

1. Introduction 

 

The  investigation  of  the  electrical  conductance  of  nanowires  is  in  the  focus  of 

the  quest  for  developing  novel  submicron  and  nano-size  electrical  devices.  Molecular 

devices  already  demonstrated  include  molecular  wires,  field  effect  transistors,  single 
electron transistors, molecular diodes, rectifiers and switches.1,2 Localized Joule heating 

poses  a  crucial  question  over  the  functionality  and  reliability  of  such  devices.  The 

combination of small molecular heat capacity and inefficient heat transfer away from it 

may cause a large temperature increase that will affect the stability and integrity of the 

molecular  junction.  The  rate  at  which  heat  is  transported  away  from  the  conducting 

junction is therefore crucial to the successful realization of nano electronics devices. 

As in macroscopic solids conductors heat can be carried away from the junction 

by  electrons  and  phonons.    In  metals  heat  flow  is  dominated  by  electrons,  while  in 

insulators  heat  is  transmitted  solely  by  phonons.  This  study  focuses  on  the  phononic 

mode  of  heat  transfer.  Theoretical  interest  in  this  mode  of  heat  transfer  in  solids  goes 
back to Peierls' early work.3 Recently it was found that thermal transport properties of 

nanowires can be very different from the  corresponding bulk properties. For example, 
Rego  and  Kirczenow4  have  shown  theoretically  that  in  the  low  temperature  ballistic 

regime, the phonon thermal conductance of a 1 dimensional quantum wire is quantized, 

and have obtained

 as the universal quantum conductance unit, where kB 

and h are the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively, and T is the temperature. 

Also of considerable interest are attempts to derive the macroscopic Fourier law of heat 

conduction in 1-dimensional systems from microscopic considerations. The Fourier law 

is a relationship between the heat current J per unit area A and the temperature gradient

     (1) 

where A is the cross-section area normal to the direction of heat propagation and  K(cid:4) is 

the thermal conductivity (the thermal conductance K is defines as
∆ ). Perfect 
harmonic  chains  were  theoretically  investigated  by  Rieder  and  Lebowitz5  and  by 
Zürcher  and  Talkner6  who  found  that  heat  flux  in  these  systems  is  proportional  to  the 

K J

temperature  difference  and  not  to  the  temperature  gradient.  Consequently,  the  thermal 

conductivity  diverges  with  increasing  chain  length.  Anomalous  heat  conduction  was 

3

 

also found in 1-dimensional models of colliding hard particles.7,8 Different models that 

potentially  avoid  this  divergence  and  yield  Fourier  law  conduction  were  discussed. 
Some  invoke  impurities  and  disorder9,10,  others11,12  consider  anharmonicity  as  the 

source  of    normal  heat  conduction.  Numerical  simulations  for  chains  with  a  random 
potential were performed by Mokross,13 and the role of phonon-lattice interaction was 
studies  by  Hu  et  al.14  Still,  there  is  yet  no  convincing  and  conclusive  result  about  the 

validity of Fourier law in 1D systems. 

Experimentally,  remarkable  progress  has  been  achieved  in  the  last  decade  in 

nanoscale  thermometry,  and  measurements  on  the  scale  of  the  mean  free  path  of 

phonons  and  electrons  are  possible.  Using  scanning  thermal  microscopy  methods  one 

can obtain the spatial temperature distribution of the sample surface, study local thermal 
properties  of  materials,  and  perform  calorimetry  at  nanometric  scale.15,16  The  thermal 

conductivity  and  thermoelectric  power  of  single  carbon  nanotubes  were  studied  both 
experimentally17  and  theoretically18,19.  In  a  different  experiment,  Schwab  et  al20  have 

observed  the  quantum  thermal  conductance  in  a  nano  fabricated  1D  structure,  which 

behaves  essentially  like  a  phonon  waveguide.  Their  results  agree  with  the  theoretical 
predictions.4  These  and  other  experimental  and  theoretical  developments  in  this  field 
have been recently reviewed.21 

In a recent paper22 we have estimated the rate of heat generation in a model of a 

current carrying molecular junction. We have found that a substantial (~0.1-0.5) fraction 

of the voltage drop across the junction is dissipated as heat on the molecule, implying 
that  a  power  of  the  order  of  1011  eV/s  may  be  released  as  heat  on  a  molecular  bridge 

carrying  a  current  of  10nA  under  a  bias  of  1eV.  This  would  cause  a  substantial 

temperature rise in the molecule unless heat is effectively carried into the metal leads. 

This motivates a study of molecular heat conduction. In Ref. 22 we have used a simple 

classical  continuum  model  (Fig.  1)  in  which  the  molecular  bridge  is  represented  by  a 
cylinder characterized by a heat conduction coefficient ~ σh= 10-4 cal/(s·cm·K), typical 

to  solid  saturated  alkanes.  However  classical  heat  conduction  theory  is  expected  to 

overestimate  the  heat  flux  through  a  single  molecule  that  has  a  discrete  vibrational 

frequency spectrum, and a molecular level treatment is needed for a correct description 

of this process.

FIG. 1: A schematic representation of a molecular chain connecting two heat reservoirs. 

In  the  present  paper  we  address  this  problem,  focusing  on  the  steady  state 

phononic  heat  transfer  through  a  molecule  connecting  two  macroscopic  thermal 

reservoirs  of  different  temperatures.  The  calculation  is  based  on  the  generalized 
Langevin  equation  (GLE)  approach23,24,25,6  which  is  recast  for  a  model  of  single 

molecule  junction.  The  resulting  expression  for  the  heat  current  through  harmonic 
molecules  is  analogous  to  the  Landauer  expression  for  electrical  conductance.26  We 

apply our formalism to realistic models of molecular systems: alkane chains of varying 

lengths, using the HyperChem package to generate molecular structures and obtain their 

vibrational  (normal  mode)  spectrum,  and  using  a  Debye  model  for  the  thermal 

reservoirs.  This  enables  us  to  study  the  dependence  of  the  heat  transfer  on  the  bridge 

length, the temperature and molecular composition, as well as on the spectral properties 

of the reservoirs.  

Section  2  introduces  our  formal  model  for  phononic  heat  transfer  through 

molecular  bridges,  and  Section  3  describes  our  theoretical  approach  that  yields 

Langevin-type equations of motion for the molecular subsystem and an expression for 

the heat transfer rate. Section 4 presents some numerical results for the heat conduction 

by  alkane  and  alkane-like  bridges  connecting  Debye  solids,  and  discusses  their 

implications. Section 5 concludes. 

 

2.  Model 

We consider a molecule connecting two independent macroscopic solids, L and 

R, which are held at fixed temperatures TL and TR respectively. In steady state there is a 

constant heat flow between these two heat reservoirs through the molecule. A schematic 

representation of the model is depicted in Figure 1. The Hamiltonian of this system is a

molecule-bath interaction HMB,

Even though the heat flow in our system is 1-dimensional, the thermal reservoirs 

and the molecular bridge are three dimensional objects. The reservoirs are represented 

as systems of independent harmonic oscillators at thermal equilibrium. In what follows 

we  consider  a  harmonic  molecule  coupled  linearly  to  these  thermal  environments. 

Anharmonic effects will be discussed in Section 4 where we show that for the relative 

short  chains  considered  here  and  at  room  temperature  they  are  relatively  small.  For 

simplicity we assume that only the end atoms, i=1 and i=N, of the molecular chain are 

coupled (linearly) to the solids. To simplify our presentation we write the molecule-bath 

coupling in 1-dimension (the analogous 3-dimensional expressions that are used in the 

computations  are  given  in  Appendix  A).  The  Hamiltonian  associated  with  the 
environment and its coupling to the molecule is then given by25

that  relates  the  N-vector  x  of  mass  weighted  local  coordinates  to  the  N-vector  x   of

Note that the coordinates x1 and xN that appear in (3) and (5) are local, corresponding to 

the  positions  of  the  first  and  last  atoms  in  the  linear  molecular  chain,  and  when  re-

expressed in terms of the molecular normal modes results in coupling terms that connect 

all normal modes to the thermal reservoirs. A similar transformation to mass weighted 

representation  is  done  also  on  the  normal  modes  of  the  macroscopic  solids.  The 

Hamiltonian terms (3)-(5) then become

The  total  Hamiltonian  is  the  sum  of  the  terms  in  Eqs.  (6),  (8)  and  (9).  In  this 

representation  all  the  molecular  information  is  contained  in  its  normal  modes 

frequencies, the transformation matrix C and the coupling constants Vl and Vr. It should 

7

 

be  evident  that  the  same  treatment  can  be  done  for  three  dimensional  molecule-bath 

coupling (see Appendix A). 

In  the  following  section  we  use  this  harmonic  model  to  calculate  the  heat 

transport  properties  of  molecular  junctions.  This  assumes  that  heat  transport  in  such 

junctions  is  dominated  by  the  harmonic  part  of  the  molecular  nuclear  potential.  The 

extent to which this assumption holds will be examined later.  

3. Calculation of the steady state heat flux 

Here we use the model outlined in Sect. 2 to calculate the steady state phonon 

energy transfer between the two thermal baths through the molecular link. Starting from 

the coupled classical equations of motion for all (molecular and baths) modes, we derive 

a  set  of  classical  Langevin  equations  for  the  molecular  modes  by  projecting  out  the 

baths degrees of freedom. Then, using the classical equations as a guide, we construct 

the  corresponding  quantum  Langevin  equations 

for 

the  molecular  system. 

Transformation  to  the  frequency  domain  makes  it  possible  to  extract  steady  state 

information  and  finally  yields  the  steady-state  heat  current  from  the  transformed 

equations.  

Equations  of  motion.  The  classical  equations  of  motion  for  all  modes  are

The above procedure is a standard derivation of a generalized Langevin equation 

usually used to describe a system coupled to its thermal environment. In our case, when 

the system is driven by different environments out of equilibrium with each other, it is 

useful to look at the resulting equations as describing a driven system. To this end we 

note that Eqs. (13) and (14), viewed as a set of deterministic linear equations, describe a 

;

k

=

1,...,

N

 of damped harmonic oscillators, driven by a set of oscillators 

}

 that move independently of the driven system (in our case – according to 

Eqs. (14) with initial conditions that will be averaged on at the end of the calculation). 

These oscillators act on the system additively, and the effect of each may be considered 

separately. Our following derivation is facilitated by considering a version of Eq. (13) 

with only one driving mode x0 of frequency ω0,

At long time a system described by these equations approaches a steady state in which 

the  external  mode  0,  which  may  belong  to  either  the  L  or  the  R  bath,  drives  all  other 

system  modes  to  oscillate  at  frequency  ω0  with  amplitude  derived  from  that  of  the 

driving mode. 

The  formulation  of  our  problem  in  terms  of  Eqs.  (19)  and  (20),  with  Eq.  (20)

representing one of the external bath modes that drives the molecular system, makes it 

possible  to  address  the  system  in  non  equilibrium  situations.  For  example,  Eqs.  (19)- 

(20) describe the physics of a system in which only external mode 0 is excited while the 

others  are  at  T=0.  Moreover,  the  motion  of  mode  0,  determined  by  the  choice  of 

x(cid:4)
0 (0)

and 

(0)x(cid:5)(cid:4)

  does  not  have  to  be  thermal.  Furthermore,  this  formulation  makes  it 

possible  to  calculate  the  flux  distribution  into  the  different  bath  modes  given  that  the 

mode 0 drives the system. To do this one needs to use the solution of Eq. (19) (obtained 

under  the  driving  (20))  in  Eqs.  (12)  to  find  the  response  of  other  bath  modes  to  the 

driving  by  mode  0.  Such  a  calculation  is  facilitated  by  replacing  Eqs.  (12)  by  their 

damped analogs:

The long time solution to Eqs. (19)-(21) is a steady state in which energy flows from the 

driving  mode  0  into  the  { }l

  and  { }r   modes  through  the  molecular  modes{ }k .  In 

particular, the steady state heat flux channeled through, e.g., the mode r is given by the 

rate of energy dissipation out of this mode

J →   correspond  to  the  transmitted  and  reflected  fluxes,

respectively.27   

The  above  formulation  portrays  in  a  somewhat  new  light  the  familiar  double 

role,  driving  and  damping,  assumed  by  bath  modes  in  such  problems.  In  equilibrium 

these  two  actions  are  balanced  by  the  fluctuation-dissipation  theorem.  In  non-

equilibrium  situations  it  is  sometime  useful  to  consider  these  two  roles  separately. 

Indeed,  later  below  we  will  calculate  the  energy  (heat)  flux  induced  by  one  driving 

mode  throughout  the  system.  The  net  heat  flux  at  frequency  ω0  is  obtained  as  the 

difference  between  such  fluxes  originated  in  the  two  baths  and  weighted  by  the 

corresponding density of modes. The total heat flux is obtained by integrating over all 

frequencies.  Before  that,  however,  we  construct  the  quantum  equations  of  motion 

equivalent to (19)-(20). 

Quantum  equations  of  motion.    For  a  system  of  harmonic  oscillators  the  equations 

representing  the  classical  dynamics,  Eqs.  (11)-(20),  may  be  also  viewed  as  quantum 

EOMs  for  the  Heisenberg  position  and  momenta  operators.  The  formal  connection  is 

made  as  usual  by  first  defining  linear  transformation  on  the  position  and  momentum 

variables

with k going over all bridge modes. A similar equation is obtained for the operators Al 

of the left-side bath.  

Calculation of the heat flux. Eqs. (37) and (33) lead to linear relationships between the 

operators  Al  (or  Ar)  that  describe  the  driven  outgoing  bath  modes  and  between  the 

operators 

0a  and 

0a  that describe the driving mode. This can be used to compute the 

†

heat  flux  through  a  system  subjected  to  such  driving.  Different  approaches  to 

calculating  the  heat  flux  through  a  system  of  linear  oscillators  can  be  found  in  the 
literature30,31,6,32,33  and  a  common  method  suitable  in  particular  to  1-dimensional 
systems is based on calculating the work done by atom i on its neighbor i-1.6 For our 

model this leads to, e.g. at the right side metal-bath contact

where the coupling parameters g were introduced in Eq. (3) and the symmetrized form 
is needed for quantum mechanical calculations.34 Obviously, at steady state the heat flux 

is independent of the position along the chain. A more general systematic derivation of 

the energy flux operator, based on conservation laws and valid for all phases of matter, 

is  given  in  Refs.  31,35.  Our  present  approach  is  different  and,  for  example,  makes  it 

possible to study the energy resolved flux. The equivalence between our approach and 

that based on Eq. (38) is shown in Appendix C. 

For definiteness we take the driving mode 0 to belong to the bath L. At steady 

state the energy flux into (and out of) the mode r of the bath R is given by the quantum 

 

 

analog of (22), i.e.

We  conclude  this  Section  with  two  remarks.  First,  as  already  noted,  the  same 

result as given by Eqs. (45)-(50) can be obtained from the more conventional approach 

based  on  Eq.  (38)  (see  Appendix  C).  Secondly,  even  though  our  treatment  was 

described in the framework of a 1-dimensional molecule-bath coupling, the results are 

valid for a 3-dimensional coupling model: the needed input are the coupling elements 

between all the molecular normal-modes {k} and the phonons of the thermal baths {l} 

and {r}. See Appendix A for details. 

 

 

4. Results and discussion 

We  next  apply  the  formalism  described  above  to  the  calculation  of  phonon 

induced  heat  transfer  thermal  conductance  of  a  molecular  bridge  connecting  two 

identical  thermal  reservoirs  at  different  temperatures.  We  study  alkane  chains  of 

variable  length,  and  compare  their  heat  transport  properties  to  other  ordered  and 

disordered chains. The information needed for any given molecular bridge is the normal 

mode spectrum of the molecular system and the corresponding transformation matrix C 

(cf. Eq. (7)). These were obtained using the Hyperchem 6 computer package, with the 

isolated molecular geometry optimized using the Restricted Hartree-Fock method with 

the  semi-empirical  PM3  parameterization  method.  The  index  N  that  denotes  the 

molecule  length  is  the  number  of  backbone  atoms,  i.e.  the  carbones  for  the  alkane 

systems. The parameters that characterize the reservoirs are the Debye cutoff frequency 
ωc,  which  is  taken  in  the  range  ωc  =200-800  cm-1,  and  the  temperatures  TL  and

itself is taken small, typically ∆T= 10-3K, so T represents the average temperature of the 

two reservoirs.

Next consider the molecule-reservoirs coupling. We assume, as in Eq. (5), that it 

is  affected  by  the  extreme  end-atoms  on  the  two  molecular  edges.  This  coupling  is 

commonly characterized by the spectral density function, e.g. between atom 1 and the

 Here m1=mN is the mass of the end atom on the molecular chain.  Further simplification 

is  achieved  by  considering  atomic  baths  for  which  m(ω)=mB  and  by  assuming  that 

g(ω)=g  does  not  depend  on  ω.  The  magnitude  of  g  measures  the  strength  of  the 

molecule- bath coupling. In a model where we take the coupling between the molecular 

chain and the thermal reservoirs to be dominated (or gated) by the coupling between the 

end  chain  atoms  (1  and  N)  and  their  nearest  neighbor  atoms  (L  and  R,  say)  in  the 

corresponding reservoirs, we may write this coupling (in correspondence with Eqs. (3) 

and (5)) as (focusing for definiteness of notation on the left reservoir)

Once the normal mode spectrum and the transformation matrix C (Eq. (7)) have 

been calculated, Eq. (10), (33), (35), (47) and (50) are used to calculate the heat flux and 

the heat conductance. The latter is defined by

The thermal conductivity of 1-dimensional atomic chains and its dependence on 
the  chain  length  was  studied  before  by  several  groups.5,6,30  It  was  found5,6  that  in  a 

perfect  harmonic  chain  the  heat  flux  is  not  proportional  to  the  temperature 

gradient (

T∆ , was predicted to be independent of the chain 

length,  and  the  thermal  conductivity  for  unit  cross-sectional  area, 

/J

T∇ ,  therefore 

diverges  as  the  chain  length  goes  to  infinity.  Motion  in  our  molecular  chains  is  not 

restricted  to  one  dimension,  still  the  proximity  of  these  chains  to  the  1-dimensional 

models suggests perhaps a similar behavior. 

Figure  2  shows  the  dependence  of  the  calculated  heat  conductance  on  chain 

length for linear alkanes of 2-25 carbon atoms at different temperatures. The molecule-
reservoir coupling parameter was taken a=8000 cm-1. The conductance becomes length 

independent for N>15, while for short chains, N=2-4, we see an unexpected rise of the 

conductance with chain length. The inset shows a similar result for the strong coupling 
case,  a=1.2·105  cm-1,  and  T=1000K.  Here  the  heat  conductance  appears  to  decrease 

like

The  asymptotic  dependence  of  the  heat  conductance  on  the  chain  length  is  of 

particular interest. Fourier's law of heat conductance would imply a 1/N dependence on 

chain  length,  while  simple  arguments  based  on  Eq.  (47)  suggest  that  the  conductance 

should  be  length  independent  for  long  chains.  The  argument  is  that  the  phononic

disregarded, the heat flux J is expected to be length independent. The actual answer to 

this issue depends on the density and the localization properties of the molecular normal 

modes. 

Figures 3 and 4 display some properties of the normal modes in alkane chains. 

Figure  3  depicts  the  density  of  modes  for  chains  with  N=15  and  N=30  atoms.  Three 

domains, separated by gaps, are seen in the spectrum. A group of low frequency modes 

in the range below 600 cm-1, intermediate frequency modes with ω=700-1500 cm-1 and 

high frequency modes of ω=2950-3200 cm-1.  Note that the modes in the intermediate 

20

 

region have the highest density of states, and that the modes density increases linearly 

with the molecular size. 

 

 

FIG 3: The spectral distribution of normal modes of alkane chains of lengths N=15 and N=30. 

 

 

 

In  order  to  gain  a  better  understanding  of  these  normal  modes  we  follow 
previous  work  on  heat  transfer  in  disordered  harmonic  media.35,37.  In  particular,  the 

ability of any mode to transfer energy across the molecule depends on its spatial extent, 

which may be characterized by the participation ratio Pk. In the present application we 
use a variation of the measure suggested by38. Define the weight associated with normal 

mode k on the carbon segment n as the sum  

where αn  goes  over  all  atoms  (hydrogens  and  carbon)  associated  with  a  given  carbon 

atom. Note that

character.

chain-length  dependence  of  heat  transport  in  our  model  junction.  This  can  be  seen  by 

22

 

studying  separately  the  heat  conduction  behavior  of  the  three  frequency  groups.  It 

should be emphasized that the contributions of different modes to the heat conduction is 

not additive, as can be seen from the presence of cross terms in Eq. (47). Still, looking 

at these separate contributions provides useful insight, and in fact describing the overall 

heat  conduction  as  an  additive  combination  of  contributions  from  the  three  frequency 

groups defined above is found (see below) to be a good approximation for long enough

Figures 5-6 show the heat conductance vs. alkane chain-length for the low and 
intermediate frequency modes respectively, at different temperatures, using ωc=400cm-1 
and  a=1.2·105  cm-1  (same  parameters  as  in  the  inset  of  Fig.  2).  The  following 

observations can be made: 

(1) The conductance associated with the low frequency modes (Fig. 5) does not depend 

on the chain length at low temperatures (T), however it decreases with chain length in 

the high temperature regime. 

(2) The intermediate frequency modes (Fig. 6) show a very different behavior: For low 

temperature  the  conductance  decreases  exponentially,  while  for  high  temperature,  it 

becomes length independent.  

(3) The high frequency modes (figure not shown) basically show the same behavior as 

that of the intermediate frequency group, with stronger variations about the systematic 

trend.  However,  the  absolute  contribution  of  these  modes  to  the  heat  transfer  is 

negligible as compared to the other two groups.  

These different modes of behavior can be understood as transitions between two 

modes of transport: tunneling-like and resonant. Consider, for example, Fig. 6. At very 

low  temperatures  modes  of  the  thermal  reservoirs  that  are  in  resonance  with  the 

intermediate  molecular  modes  considered  here  are  not  populated.  Only  low-frequency 

modes  of  the  reservoirs  are excited,  and  the  transmission  of  the  energy  between  these 

reservoirs through the molecule is a transfer of low frequency phonons through a bridge 

of relatively high frequency vibrations. This leads to a tunneling type behavior with an 

exponential decrease of the transmission with bridge length, in analogy with the super-
exchange  mechanism  of  electron  transfer.40  When  the  temperature  increases,  higher 

frequency  modes  of  the  reservoirs,  which  are  in  resonance  with  the  intermediate 

molecular modes are excited and contribute to resonance transmission which is distance 

independent. Similar considerations apply in principle to the high frequency modes, but 

the contribution of these modes to the heat transfer is small because the Debye cutoff ωc 

of the reservoir spectra is considerably below these modes.  

Consider  now  Figure  5,  which  shows  the  chain-length  dependence  of  the  heat 

conduction  by  the  low  frequency  molecular  mode.  Here  we  see  an  opposite  behavior, 

where  the  heat  conductance  does  not  depend  on  chain-length  at  low  T,  while  it 

24

 

decreases with chain length at high T. The same arguments as before apply also in this 

case. At low temperatures heat transfer involves low frequency reservoir modes that are 

in  resonance  with  the  molecular  frequencies  of  this  group,  hence  the  length 

independence  of  the  transmission.  For  high  T,  the  high-frequency  reservoir  modes  are 

activated, however transmission involving these modes is a non-resonance process that 

decreases  with  chain  length.  The  dependence  on  length  in  this  case  is  weaker  than 

exponential  because  the  thermal  shift  of  population  from  low  to  high  frequency 

reservoir modes is very gradual.  

We emphasize these observations by comparing the heat conductance from the 

low  and  intermediate  frequency  molecular  modes,  calculated  at  the  unphysical 

temperature T=3000K where their relative contributions are comparable, see the dashed-

dotted  lines  in  Figs  5-6.  (The  contribution  of  the  high  frequency  molecular  modes  is 

small  even  at  this  unphysically  high  temperature).  In  this  temperature  range  the 

conductance  due  to  the  low-frequency  modes  (figure  5)  decreases  with  chain-length, 

that of the intermediate modes (figure 6) is length independent and their superposition is 

therefore  expected  to  show  a  relatively  weak  length  dependence.  We  have  verified 

numerically  that  taking  a  simple  superposition  of  these  two  contributions  is  indeed  a 

good approximation to the full calculation for chains longer than 6-7 carbon atoms, and 

therefore  this  analysis  holds.    For  very  long  chains  the  non-resonant  contributions  die 

out  and  heat  transmission  becomes  length  independent,  though  because  only  a  few 

modes may be extended enough it may be small. The turnover to length dependence at 

smaller  chain-lengths  and  the  actual  length  dependence  of  the  overall  conduction  for 

relatively  short  chains  depends  on  the  molecule-reservoir  coupling  strength,  on  the 

temperature and on phonon spectra of both molecule and reservoirs. 

The dependence of the heat conductance on the temperature is depicted in Fig. 7. 
The  system  parameters  used  here  are  a=8000  cm-1  and  ωc=800  cm-2.  At  the  high 

temperature  limit,  shown  in  the  inset,  the  conductance  saturates  to  the  value 

dω ω
(
)

,  that  corresponds  to  the  high  temperature  limit  of  equation  (50).  In  this 

limit the conductance decreases with the chain length N. At the very low temperatures, 

main graph, the trend is reversed: the conductance increases with chain lengths for short

The  conductance  increase  with  longer  chain  length,  seen  in  Fig.  7  and  also  on 

the  short  chain  (left)  sides  of  Figs.  2  and  5,  seems  at  first  counter  intuitive,  however

length  at  several  temperatures.  Variation  of  the  chain  length  affects  the  molecular 

normal  mode  spectrum  in  two  ways.    First,  the  overall  density  of  states  is  increased 

linearly.  Secondly,  the  lower  bound  on  this  density  is  shifted  to  lower  values.  For 

example, for a pentane (N=5) the lowest vibrational frequency mode is ω=84 cm-1, for 

decane (N= 10) it is ω=28 cm-1, while for N=20 it is ω =7 cm-1. At low temperatures the 

heat current is carried mostly by low frequency phonons, and when the chain becomes 

longer, more molecular modes come into resonance with these incoming phonons. This 

causes an increase in the heat flux. Obviously, this effect should be significant only at 

very low temperatures, as indeed seen in Fig. 8.

Dashed line: 12C chains; full line: 28C chains; dotted line: disordered 12C − 28C chains with 1:1

Disordered chains. Figure 9 compares the heat conduction of pure alkane chains 

to  similar  chains  with  a  random  distribution  of  two  masses  with  1:1  component  ratio. 
ωc=400 cm-1, a=8000 cm-1, and T=300K were used in these calculations. The chains are 

normal  alkanes  in  which  the  atomic  masses  of  half  the  carbon  atoms  have  been  set 
artificially  to  28.  12C/28C  case.  We  see  that  for  a  long  enough  chain,  the  heavy  atom 

chains  with  smaller  normal  mode  frequencies  conduct  less  effectively  than  their  light 

atom analogs. This results from the balance of three effects. First, the contributions of 

modes of different frequencies depend on the corresponding reservoirs density of mode 

spectra.  Secondly,  it  depends  on  the  thermal  populations  of  these  modes.  Finally,  the 

energy  carried  by  a  mode  of  frequency ω  is  proportional  to ω.  The  effect  of  disorder 
also involves balancing factors: Starting from, e.g., the 28C chain and replacing some of 
these  heavy  atoms  with  the  12C  isotope  would  reduce  heat  conduction  because  of 

localization  (for  example,  in  a  20  carbon  chain  the  localization  measure  exp  S ,  Eq. 

(63) averaged over all modes, is 14.1 for a pure 12C chain, 12.5 for 28C system, and only 
7.5  for  the  random  12C/28C  chain).  This  is  partly  balanced  by  the  shift  of  the  mixed 
structures spectrum into frequencies above those of the pure 28C chain. In Figure 9 this 
results in little difference in the heat conduction of a pure 28C chain and a 12C/28C mixed 

chain.  

Finally  we  note  that  a  similar  behavior  is  seen  for  the  realistic  12C/14C  chains, 

however the difference between the heat conductions of the pure and the mixed chains 

in this case is quite small and are hardly resolved on the scale of Fig. 9 (see inset).  

 

Anharmonic  effects.  In  macroscopic  systems  and  in  fact  whenever  the  system 

size is larger than the localization length and/or mean free path (determined by disorder 

and scattering by anharmonic interactions) heat conduction is dominated by anharmonic 

coupling. In our short molecular chains such effects are expected to play a much lesser 

role,  at  least  at  low  temperature.  To  examine  this  issue  we  have  carried  out  classical 

numerical  simulations  of  heat  conduction  through  a  1-dimensional  model  of  alkane 

28

 

chains  without  invoking  the  harmonic  approximation.  Details  of  the  model  and  the 

calculation are provided in Appendix D. 

 

 

 

 

FIG.  10:  Heat  current  vs.  chain  length  obtained  from  a  classical  simulation  of  heat  transport 
through 1-dimensional model alkane chains characterized by different anharmonic interactions. 
Full  line:  harmonic  chain;  dashed  line:  anharmonic  chain  using  the  alkane  force  field 
parameters; dash-dotted line: anharmonic chain with unphysically large anharmonicity (ξ of Eq. 
(D2) taken 36 times the alkane value). γ=10ps-1 (γ is the friction coefficient defined in Appendix 
D), TR=300K, TL=0K were used in this simulation. 

Figure  10  shows  the  heat  current  obtained  from  such  a  calculation.  For  a  long 

harmonic chain the heat flux is ballistic and does not depend on chain length. The result 

for the full alkane model (dashed line) and the corresponding harmonic approximation 

(full line) are seen to behave in this way and to be very close to each other. Only when 

the  molecular  anharmonicity  is  taken  unphysically  large  (dashed-dotted  line)  we  see 

deviation  from  this  behavior  and  a  decrease  of  the  current  with  chain  length.  Similar 

deviations from the harmonic behavior (not shown) are seen at elevated temperatures, 

but only when T is unphysically high, say T  ≥  2000K. 

 

Comparison to classical heat transfer. Finally, we compare the heat conduction 

properties  of  the  harmonic  chains  considered  in  this  paper  with  the  continuum  heat 

transport  model  used  in  Ref.  22.  In  that  paper  the  molecule  was  represented  by  a 

cylinder  connecting  the  two  heat  reservoirs  (Fig.  1)  and  a  continuum  model  was 

employed to estimate the heat conduction, using for the thermal conductivity coefficient 

29

 

the value 

hσ = 3.5·10-4 cal/(s·cm·K) typical of bulk organic solids. For a model in which 

the  molecular  cylinder  of  length  60Å  is  suspended  in  vacuum  between  the  two  heat 

reservoirs at 300K a modest temperature rise of a few degrees was found when heat was 
deposited uniformly on the cylinder at a rate of 1010eV/s (corresponding to about 1nA 

electron  current  flowing  across  a  potential  bias  of  1V).  Clearly  however,  macroscopic 

heat conduction, dominated by impurity scattering and anharmonic interactions cannot 

reliably  represent  heat  conduction  of  molecular  junctions  that  is  characterized  by 

harmonic  (ballistic)  transport  on  one  hand,  and  by  restricted  geometry  and  the 

availability of conducting modes on the other.  

 

For definiteness we assume that the coupling between the molecular chain and 

the  thermal  reservoirs  is  dominated  (or  gated)  by  the  coupling  between  two  nearest 

neighbor  alkane  carbon  atoms.  This  is  expected  to  overestimate  the  actual  thermal 

coupling  in  most  molecular  junctions.  This  implies  that  in  Eq.  (59)  we  take 

g
1, L

=

g= ).  Also  for  definiteness  we  assign  carbon

masses to the baths, i.e. take 

m
C
=7.2·10-3  dyne/Å  (from  the  Hyperchem  force  field)  and  mC=2·10-26  kg.  This  implies 
(from  Eq.  (59))    a=2·107  cm-1  for ωc=400  cm-1  ,  a=2.5·106  cm-1  for ωc=800  cm-1  and 
a=5·105  cm-1  for ωc=1400  cm-1.  The  latter ωc  is  the  order  of  the  Debye  frequency  of 

. The corresponding numerical values are g 

diamond. 

 

Numerical  results  obtained  from  this  model  are  compared  to  the  classical 

cylinder  model  of  Ref.  22  are  shown  in  Fig.  11.  The  classical  calculation  was  done 

using

coefficient,  and  a  cross-sectional  area  A  =  3.5  Ǻ2  for  the  "molecular"  cylinder.  The 

length  of  the  cylinder  that  corresponds  to  an  alkane  chain  with  N  carbon  atoms  was 
LA(cid:4)

taken  L=1.2N  Ǻ.  Note  that  the  heat  conductance  of  this  classical  object,  K=
decreases as N-1 with chain length. For N=5-20 we get that K=10 –11-10 –12 W/oK. 

 

 

The  results  displayed  in  Fig.  11  show  that  the  heat  conduction  of  the 

macroscopic  cylinder  overestimates  that  of  the  molecular  model  by  about  an  order  of 

magnitude  at  room  temperature,  while  they  are  very  similar  at  T=1000K.  These 

observations are not very sensitive to details of the chosen coupling and reservoir cutoff 

parameters  within  a  reasonable  range.  In  view  of  the  different  mechanisms  involved, 

30

 

one  should  not  take  the  similar  transport  properties  at  1000K  as  an  approach  to  the 

classical  limit  at  high  T.  More  significant  is  the  finding  that  at  room  temperature  the 

classical model strongly overestimates the heat conduction properties of the individual 

molecule, an observation of important potential consequences for estimating heating in 

conjunction with electrical conduction in molecular junctions.

5. Conclusions 

The  heat  conduction  properties  of  molecular  chains  connecting  two  thermal 

reservoirs were investigated theoretically and numerically, focusing on saturated alkane 

chains as a primary example. It was found that heat conduction in relatively short chain 

is  dominated  by  harmonic  interactions.  The  harmonic  approximation  utilized  yields  a 

Landauer  type  expression  (Eq.  (50))  for  the  heat  current,  where  energy  is  carried 

ballistically  through  the  wire.  The  principal  factors  that  determine  heat  conduction  in 

such molecular junctions are the molecular vibrational spectral density, the localization 

properties of molecular normal modes in the different spectral regimes, the coupling of 

the molecule to the reservoirs and the cutoff frequency that characterizes the reservoirs 

spectral  densities.  The  dependence  of  the  heat  conduction  on  molecular  length  varies 

31

 

with temperature and reflects the different localization properties of different molecular 

spectral  regimes.  Mode  localization  also  causes  disordered  chains  to  be  less  effective 

heat  conductors.  A  classical  heat  conduction  model  was  found  to  overestimate  the 

microscopic  result  by  about  one  order  of  magnitude,  an  observation  of  potential 

importance  for  the  estimate  of  heating  associated  with  electrical  conduction  in 

molecular junction.   

 

 

Appendix A: The 3-dimesional case 

Generalization  of  the  formulation  presented  in  sections  2-3  into  three 

dimensions is trivial. Since both molecule and reservoirs are described in terms of their 

normal  modes,  the  dimensionality  enters  explicitly  only  in  the  form  of  the  molecule-

reservoir coupling. In three dimensions the Hamiltonian, Eq. (3), takes the form

strength g to be the same for the three directions. The transformation matrix C (Eq.(7))

the  vector  r  represent  the  x,y,  and  z  coordinates  of  an  atom  in  the  molecule.  The

The procedure outlined above is a standard derivation of a generalized Langevin 

equation  to  be  used  in  the  long  time  limit  of  the  system-bath  interaction  where  initial 

system information can be neglected. A different approach can be used to get directly 

the steady-state equations for a driven quantum system. This formulation uses the ideas 

of  sections  2-3:  the  quantization  of  the  momentum  and  displacement,  Eqs.  (23)-(27), 

driven steady-state dynamics, Eq.(29) and working in the frequency domain. We focus 

34

 

on the left reservoir and start again from Eq. (12), but replaced by its damped analog, 

Eq. (21):

Thus, Eq. (B13) is (after supplementing similar terms arising from the right reservoir) 

the same as Eq. (33).  

 

 

Appendix C. Calculation the heat flux from Eq. (38) 

The classical power transfer through harmonic chain as given in  6 is calculated

Appendix D.  Molecular chain model 

The procedure for calculating the heat conduction through 1-dimensional model 

of alkane chains without invoking the harmonic approximation is represented here. The 

model  consists  of  a  1  dimensional  anharmonic  carbon  chain  of  length  N  linking  two 

reservoirs  whose  temperatures  are  denoted  by  TL  and  TR.  The  model  Hamiltonian  is 

given by

where  the  atoms  indexed  by  0  and  N+1  are  the  left  and  right  reservoirs  atoms 

respectively. In the classical simulation the positions of these atoms are taken constants, 

and the dynamical effect of the reservoir is represented by Langevin forces and damping 

terms  as  described  below.  The  Morse  parameters α  and  D  and  the  equilibrium  bond 

lengths  x(cid:4)  are taken to characterize the alkane C-C stretch motion (implying that in our 

classical  model  calculation  the  first  bath  atoms  are  taken  to  be  carbons):  x=1.538

This formulation is akin to scattering theory, where mode 0 corresponds to the 

"incoming  state"  while  all  other  l  and  r  modes  are  outgoing.  Indeed  we  have 

shown that time independent quantum scattering theory can be formulated in a 
similar way28.

Eq. (28) (and similarly Eq.(40) should be regarded with some caution. For finite 

η  these  equations,  containing  damping  terms  in  time  evolution  of  boson 

operators,  are  inconsistent  with  the  normal  commutation  relations  of  such 

operators. In the present application the limit 

0η→ +  is always implied so this 

does not create a difficulty.

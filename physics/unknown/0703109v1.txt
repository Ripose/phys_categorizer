Abstract 

Quantitative-structure-toxicity-relationship  (QSTR)  models  are  developed  for 

predicting the toxicity (pIGC50) of 252 aliphatic compounds on Tetrahymena pyriformis. 

The single parameter models with a simple molecular descriptor, the number of atoms in 

the  molecule,  provide  unbelievable  results.  Better  QSTR  models  with  two  parameters 

result when global electrophilicity is used as the second descriptor. In order to tackle both 

charge-  and  frontier-controlled  reactions  the  importance  of  the  local  electro  (nucleo) 

philicities  and  atomic  charges  is  also  analyzed.  Best  possible  three  parameter  QSTR 

models are prescribed.

1. Introduction 

Ever  since  the  power  of  Quantitative-  structure-  activity-  relationship  (QSAR) 

based techniques has been highlighted, several descriptors have been proposed from time 

to 

time 

in  developing  QSAR  models1-8  for  understanding  various  aspects  of 

pharmacological  sciences  including  drug  design  and  the  possible  ecotoxicological 

characteristics of the drug molecules. Specific quantitative structure toxicity relationship 

(QSTR)  models  have  also  been  developed.  In  these  studies  the  toxicity  of  various 

chemicals  have  been  understood  via  corresponding  molecular  structures.  An  extensive 

research  has  been  carried  out9-16  in  understanding  the  toxicological  effects  of  several 

aliphatic compounds on ciliated protozoa called Tetrahymena pyriformis. Both European 

Union  and  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency  require  reliable  toxicity  data  set  for 

various  classes  of  living  systems  like  primary  producers,  invertebrates  and  vertebrates. 

This  information  is  used  for  QSAR/QSTR  as  well  as  regulatory  purposes.  The  ciliated 

protozoa,  Tetrahymena  pyriformis  has  been  considered  to  be  ideal  for  the  associated 

laboratory research. In this ciliate species, diverse endpoints can be used to originate the 

cytotoxic  effects  and  xenobiotics.  Experimental  determination  of  toxicological  and 

biochemical endpoints is a difficult task. Hence, QSAR/QSTR modeling of the toxicity of 

aliphatic  compounds  on  the  T.  pyriformis  is  of  vital  importance  in  investigation  of  its 

toxicity  in  terms  of  its  inhibitory  growth  concentration  (IGC).  A  multitude  of  QSTR 

models  exist  which  analyze  the  associated  toxicity  behavior.  Quantum  chemical 

descriptors17-20  have  also  been  used  for  this  purpose  and  they  have  been  proved  to  be 

versatile and reliable.

Toxicity  analyses  of  a  diverse  class  of  systems  have  been  carried  out  using 

conceptual  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  based  reactivity/selectivity  descriptors. 

Possibility  of  electron  transfer  between  a  toxic  molecule  and  a  biosystem  has  been 

considered  to  be  one  of  the  major  reasons  of  toxic  behavior  of  these  molecules. 

Accordingly  the  related  descriptors  like  electron  affinity,  ionization  potential,  planarity, 

electrophilicity  etc.  have  been  turned  out  to  be  useful  QSTR  descriptors.  Experimental 

toxicity  values  of  a  wide  variety  of  polyaromatic  hydrocarbons  like  polychlorinated 

dibenzofurans  (PCDFs),  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs),  polychlorinated  dibenzo-p-

dioxins (PCDDs) and chlorophenols (CP), several aliphatic and aromatic toxic molecules 

have  been  shown  to  correlate  very  well20-30  with  the  corresponding  toxicity  values 

estimated  using  various  conceptual  DFT  descriptors  especially  global  and  local 

electrophilicities.31-33 

 

Several  researchers9-16  have  studied  the  toxicological  behavior  of  various 

compounds  on  Tetrahymena  pyriformis.  They  have  highlighted  the  importance  of  the 

studies as well as the possibility of constructing a large number of QSTR models with a 

varied range of success and the difficulty in computation. A state-of-the art QSTR model 

has been developed by Schultz et al.13 Toxicity of a large number of aliphatic compounds 

on  Tetrahymena  pyriformis  has  been  studied13  through  QSTR  models  developed13  in 

terms of logP and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (ELUMO) whereas the 

effect of several aromatic compounds on the same system has been analyzed14 in terms of 

log  P,  ELUMO  and  maximum  acceptor  superdelocalizability  (Amax).  In  both  cases  the 

models are found to be robust. We have shown20,25 that global and local electrophilicities 

are useful descriptors of toxicity prediction. In the present work we propose to develop 

 

3

QSTR  models  for  toxicity  of  several  aliphatic  compounds  on  Tetrahymena  pyriformis, 

using a simple descriptor, viz. the number of atoms present in the molecule, which can be 

obtained  without  even  touching  a  computer.  Section  2  provides  the  theoretical 

background  whereas  the  computational  details  are  provided  in  section  3.  Results  and 

discussion  are  provided  in  section  4  and  finally,  section  5  contains  some  concluding 

remarks.  

2. Theoretical Background 

We  consider  the  number  of  atoms  in  a  molecule  to  be  a  valid  descriptor  of  its 

toxic nature. For a given group of molecules the number of electrons (N) is expected to 

scale as the number of atoms present (Na).  Molecules with larger Na values are supposed 

to have larger molecular weights implying larger log P values. That in turn will provide 

larger toxicity values. For simplicity we consider the number of carbon atoms (NC) as the 

variable and for the set of molecules with a constant NC we may choose the number of 

non-hydrogenic atoms (NNH) as the descriptor. Related descriptors have been used in the 

 

In order to have a complete analysis we also check the nature of the model where 

electrophilicity 

(ω  is used as an additional descriptor, which has been shown20,25 to be a 

)

reliable descriptor of biological activity19 and toxicity.20,25 The electrophilicity is defined

It  has  also  been  shown20,25  that  apart  from  global  electrophilic  power  the  local 

electro  (nucleo)  philicity  is  important  in  understanding  the  possible  charge  transfer 

between  a  toxin  and  a  receptor.  The  philicity  at  an  atom  k  of  the  molecule  is  defined

Since  the  Fukui  function  based  descriptors  are  ideally  suited  for  soft-soft-frontier-

controlled  reactions  and  the  atomic  charges  (Qk)  in  a  molecule  are  known  to  be 

appropriate  local  descriptors  in  analyzing  essentially  charged-controlled  reactions 

between a hard nucleophile and a hard electrophile36-38 we also consider the latter in our 

analysis. 

 

 

Comparing the electronegativity values of 13 sets of aliphatic compounds whose 

toxic nature towards Tetrahymena pyriformis is known,9-16 with those of various nucleic 

acid bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, cytosine and urasil) and DNA base pairs (GCWC 

and  ATH)  it  was  observed20  that  there  are  nine  groups  of  electron  acceptors  (saturated 

5

alcohols,  diols,  halogenated  alcohols,  mono-  and  di-  esters,  carboxylic  and  halogenated 

acids, aldehydes and ketones) and four groups of electron donors (unsaturated alcohols, 

α-acetylinic alcohols, amino alcohols and amines). For the former group 

+

maxω  and for 

the latter group 

−

maxω  are considered to be20 appropriate descriptors where  αωmax  refers to 

the  αωk   value  at  the  site  where  it  is  maximum.  For  the  hard  interactions, 

max
kQ   is 

considered to be the proper descriptor where k is the site with the maximum value of the 

magnitude of the charge (positive for the acceptors and negative for the donors). 

 

 

 

 

 

3. Computational Details 

 

Geometries  of  all  the  252  aliphatic  molecules  (acceptors-171,  donors-81) 

corresponding  to  the  13  groups  are  optimized  at  the  Hatree-Fock  level  with  6-311G* 

basis set using  the Gaussian 0339  program.  These  molecules  were  tested  before20,  25 for 

correlating their experimental log(IGC50

-1) values10 against Tetrahymena pyriformis with 

the corresponding values calculated in terms of global and local electrophilicities. 

Equations  (1)-(3)  are  used  to  calculate  the  global  and  local  electrophilicities. 

Necessary  population  and  charges  are  calculated  using  the  natural  population  analysis 

(NPA) scheme. Single point calculations are done for the (N±1) - electron systems with 

the N-electron molecule geometry. 

In  the  statistical  analysis,  the  systematic  search  is  performed  to  determine 

statistically significant relationships between the  toxicity and a selection of one,  two or 

three descriptors out of the six available descriptors (NC, NNH, ω, 

+
maxω , 

−

maxω  and 

max
kQ ). 

The  analysis  is  performed  using  in-house  software.  In  order  to  minimize  the  effect  of 

6

multicollinearity  and  to  avoid  redundancy,  the  descriptor  set  is  first  pre-evaluated  with 

unsupervised forward selection. This selection is a variable elimination technique where 

variables  are  physically  removed  from  the  data  set.  Variables  are  eliminated  for  two 

reasons.  First,  they  are  eliminated  if  they  have  a  small  variance,  below  some  threshold 

value.  The  second  reason  for  variable  removal  is  the  existence  of  redundancy  (exact 

linear dependencies between subsets of the variables) and multicollinearity (high multiple 

correlations  between  subsets  of  the  variables)  in  QSAR  data  sets.  Multicollinearity  and 

redundancy  may  result  in  highly  unstable  estimates  for  regression  coefficients,  because 

their  values  may  change  enormously  when  variables  are  added  or  deleted  to  the 

regression. Both these features are assessed by inspecting the multiple correlations within 

the relevant subsets of descriptors. For a detailed overview of the UFS algorithm we refer 

to  references  40  and  41.  As  regression  technique  the  multiple  linear  regression  is 

preferred over principal component regression or partial least squares regression, because 

of the ease of interpretation of the outcome. The output provided in the paper gives the 

most promising 3-parameter model for each dataset. The following statistical criteria of 

the  models  are  noted:  R,  R-square,  adjusted  R-square  and  the  standard  error  of  the 

estimate  are  measures  to  confirm  a  good  fit  of  the  data  to  the  regression  line.  Internal 

validation  is  conducted  with  leave-one-out  cross-validation  and  is  given  by  Q².    The 

significance of this value is estimated by Y-randomisation.  

A  mechanistic  interpretation  can  be  deduced  from  the  output,  by  using  the 

coefficients (b). These are descriptors calculated from scaled data values. This gives the 

opportunity  to  evaluate  the  descriptors  in  relation  to  each  other.  Outliers  are  detected 

graphically in the regression diagnostic plot. 

 

7

Each  statistical  analysis  is  preceded  by  an  analysis  of  the  dataset.  A  graphical 

analysis  of  the  residuals  (residual  plot,  normal  probability  plot  and  regression  plot) 

permits the user to confirm if the dataset is suitable for a multiple linear regression. 

4. Results and Discussion 

Experimental  and  calculated  pIGC50  values  along  with  various  descriptors  are 

presented  in  Tables  1  and  2  for  the  electron  acceptor  and  electron  donor  molecules 

respectively. Table 3 presents the corresponding regression equations associated with one 

(NC)-  and  two  (NC,ω)-  parameter  models.  The  single  parameter  model  with  a  simple 

descriptor like the number of carbon atoms provides good estimates of toxicity in most 

cases.  The  exceptions  are  carboxylic  acids,  halogenated  acids,  amino  alcohols  and 

amines.  Situation  improves  drastically  in  all  cases  except  for  amines  where  the 

information of charge is also important. The constant terms in the two-parameter models 

are  not  always  significant.  Figure  1  presents  the  plots  of  experimental  pIGC50  versus 

calculated pIGC50 values for the a) acceptor set (R2=0.9283, R2

CV=0.9279, R2

Adj=0.9265) 

and  b)  donor  set  (R2=0.8284,  R2

CV=0.8262,  R2

Adj=0.8156)  which  authenticates  the 

efficacy of these regression models for QSTR. It is also important to note that the slopes 

of these plots are unity and the intercepts are very close to zero, as expected. Although 

the predicted toxicity trend is satisfactory when compared with the observed one, for the 

individual outlier molecules it is difficult to provide with a rationale a priori. It may be 

noted that the calculated pIGC50 values plotted in Figure 1 are obtained through different 

regression models for 13 different sets of molecules. In each set the molecules of similar 

 

 

 

 

8

chemical behavior are included. In case we take all the molecules together the following 

regression equations are obtained: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pIGC50 = 0.2789× NC – 2.2484  

 

R = 0.805; SD = 0.551; N = 252 

pIGC50 = 0.2838× NC + 0.6415× ω -2.7888    

R = 0.812; SD = 0.542; N = 252 

 

 

 

 

(4a) 

(4b) 

It  may  be  noted  that  for  a  diverse  class  of  chemical  compounds  NC  and  ω  may  still  be 

considered to be useful descriptors. Corresponding plots are provided in Figure 2 (a, b). 

The  correlation  improves  further  in  case  a  couple  of  sets  are  removed  as  was  done  by 

Schultz  et  al.13    For  the  shake  of  completeness  we  also  include  the  plot  of  the 

experimental toxicity with log P for the same 252 molecules (Figure 2c). The correlation 

is  comparable  to  that  obtained  in  Figure  2a  which  is  expected  because  of  the  inter 

correlation between log P and NC (Figure 2d). It may be noted that unlike log P, NC does 

not require any software (instrument) to compute it (determine it experimentally).  

 
Now we try to develop the best possible three-parameter models (with the highest 
R2 value) by selecting all possible combinations of 1, 2 and 3 parameters chosen out of 

six  possibilities,  viz.,  NC,  NNH,  ω, 

+
maxω , 

−

maxω   and 

kQ .  Various  plots  and  the  model 

max

summary (not shown here) associated with each set reveal that it is possible to develop 

beautiful QSTR models using three parameters. They are presented sequentially. Now we 

will investigate for each set of molecules whether we can obtain three-parameter models 

which behave better than the already obtained one-and two parameter models. The best 

three-parameter  model  is  chosen  by  investigating  all  possible  combinations  of  3 

parameters  out  of  a  list  of  six  available  descriptors.  The  best  three-parameter  model  is 

chosen based on the highest R² value. To compare three-parameter models with one-and 

two  parameter  models,  we  cannot  use  the  R²  value.  The  value  of  R²  can  generally  be 

increased  by  adding  additional  descriptor  variables  to  the  model,  even  if  the  added 

 

 

 

 

 

9

variable does not contribute to reduce the unexplained variance of the dependent variable. 

This  can  be  avoided  by  using  another  statistical  parameter  –  the  so-called  adjusted  R² 

(R²adj).  

Before  any  regression  analysis  can  take  place,  we  have  to  check  the  data  set  on  a  few 

principal assumptions. These assumptions justify the use of linear regression models for 

purposes  of  prediction:  Independence,  normality  and  linearity.  If  any  of  these 

assumptions  is  violated,  then  the  insights  yielded  by  a  regression  model  may  be 

inefficient  or  seriously  biased  or  misleading.  The  characteristics  of  the  data  sets  are 

checked visually.  For a detailed overview of these assumptions and their visualization, 

the reader is referred to the reference 42. For the purpose of this article it is sufficient to 

look at the graphics (a), (c) and (d) for each of the data sets. The graphic (a) has to be a 

scattered plot of points around zero and the graphics (c) and (d) have to be a straight line 

of  points  through  the  origin.  As  one  can  see,  for  each  of  the  thirteen  data  sets,  these 

characteristics are fulfilled.   

The  performance  of  the  multiple  linear  regression  is  summarized  in  a  few  statistical 

parameters. The most important ones for this purpose are R²adj, the standard error of the 

estimate, Q² and the F-ratio. Each of these terms is explained in the previous section and 

their behavior can be found in statistical literature. If we encounter a model which does 

not behave well for one of these parameters, the model has to be rejected. Based on these 

four statistical parameters, each of the models can be accepted as statistically significant 

models.  

The fact that each of these 3- parameter models is statistically significant does not mean 

that they behave better then the corresponding 1-or 2-parameter models. In view of the 

behavior of these models one has to look at three parameters. First of all, as mentioned 

before, one has to compare the adjusted R² of the three-parameter model with those of the 

one-or  two-parameter  models.  All  of  the  three-parameter  models  concerning  R²  behave 

better than the corresponding one-or two-parameter models, except the model for the set 

of alpha-acetylenic alcohols, which behave worse than the two-parameter model.

Since  it  is  better  to  have  a  model  with  as  least  as  possible  descriptors,  according  the 
Principle of Parsimony,44 we prefer for these sets the two-parameter models.  

Three  parameter  models  are  only  better  then  the  two-parameter  models,  if  the 

three parameters  used are statistically significant. The in-house built statistical software 

conducts  this  test  of  significance  with  a  Students  t-test.  The  following  models  are 

assigned containing non-significant descriptors:

The remaining models can be used for predictive purposes, only if they do not fail on the 

Y-randomisation  test.  As  can  be  seen  on  the  graphs  (e),  this  concerns  only  the  three-

parameter  models  of  the  aliphatic  amines, the  unsaturated  alcohols,  the  monoesters  and 

the carboxylic acids. The three parameter models for these sets are

The fact that the remaining models of the halogenated alcohols, the diols and the ketones 

do  not  provide  good  Y-randomisation  test  results  might  be  originating  from  the  small 
number of molecules (respectively 11, 10 and 15 ) for the number of descriptors used.45               

It  is  important  to  note  that 

maxω+

  and 

maxω−

  respectively  appear  in  the  electron 

acceptor  and  donor  sets,  as  expected.  Except  for  the  set  of  aliphatic  amines  the  atom 

number is a valuable descriptor. The global electrophilicity is also a reliable descriptor in 

most cases.  

In order to check the efficacy of the present QSTR models vis-à-vis other existing 

popular  models  we  make  a  comparative  analysis  of  our  work  with  that  reported  by 
Schultz  et  al13  which  may  be  considered  to  be  by  far  the  best  available  till  date.  To 

compare the quality of regression we analyze our Figure 2 and Eq.(4) with their Figures 1 
& 2 and Eq.(1). As opposed to the regression presented for only neutral narcotics,13 our 

mixture  of  a  wide  class  of  compounds  shows  a  reasonable  correlation.  Like  our 

correlations  for  13  separate  groups  (both  polar  and  nonpolar)  as  presented  in  Table  3, 

their  one  parameter  models  for  nonpolar  molecules  (Table  1  of  Ref.13)  and  two 

parameter models for 7 selected classes (Table 2 of Ref.13) we notice the following: a) 

For  one  parameter  models  their  slopes  are  positive  and  intercepts  are  negative  for  all  5 

sets  and  are  of  same  orders  of  magnitude.  For  one  parameter  models  our  slopes  are 

positive and intercepts are negative for all 13 sets and are of same orders of magnitude. 

Moreover,  obtaining  log  P  is  much  more  difficult  than  counting  NC.,  b)  For  the  two 

parameter  models  their  coefficients  for  log  P  are  always  positive  as  in  our  case  the 

coefficients  for  NC  are  also  always  positive.  In  their  models  the  coefficients  for  ELUMO 

and the intercept are positive in some cases and negative in other cases as is the case with 
our coefficients of ω and the intercept., c) There is a good correlation43 between log P and 

NC.  It  is  expected  that  our  works  would  be  complimentary  to  their  work.,  d)  The 

problems  they  faced  in  modeling  carboxylic  acids,  amino  alcohols,  α-halo-activated 

compounds etc. may be better tackled using these descriptors or a combination of them 

(log P (NC), ELUMO, ω)., e) Importance of charge as the descriptor in modeling amines is 

now understood, f) Macroscopic descriptors like log P or NC would be useful for a broad 

12

 

 

spectrum  of  systems.  However,  electronic  descriptors  like  ω  would  be  useful  when 

systems with similar electronic environment are analyzed. They would be specially useful 

when molecules will have nearly identical or identical log P (NC) values. For molecules 

with similar electronic environment local (or group) electrophilicity would highlight the 

importance of the site (group) especially for the toxic behavior.  

5. Concluding Remarks  

The  number  of  atoms  in  a  molecule  can  provide  important  insights  into  its 

possible  toxic  behavior.  It  can  be  used  as  a  molecular  descriptor  for  predicting  pIGC50 

values  of  various  aliphatic  compounds  against  the  ciliate  Tetrahymena  pyriformis.  The 

situation improves further when electrophilicity is used as an additional descriptor. Local 

electro (nucleo) philicity and atomic charges are also considered to take care of local soft-

soft and hard-hard interactions, which resulted in robust three parameter QSTR models.

A  deceptively  simple  descriptor,  viz.  the  number  of  carbon  /  non-hydrogenic  atoms 
present in a molecule is prescribed for the development of useful quantitative-structure-
toxicity-relationship (QSTR) models. Please see the text for details.

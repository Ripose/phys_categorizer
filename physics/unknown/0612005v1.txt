Abstract 

 
We present a method and model for the direct and continuous separation of red and white 

blood cells in plasma. The method is implemented at the microscale using a microfluidic 

system that consists of an array of integrated soft-magnetic elements embedded beneath a 

microfluidic  channel.  The  microsystem  is  passive,  and  is  activated  via  application  of  a 

bias  field  that  magnetizes  the  elements.  Once  magnetized,  the  elements  produce  a 

nonuniform  magnetic  field  distribution  in  the  microchannel, which gives rise to a force 

on blood cells as they pass through the microsystem. In whole blood, white blood cells 

behave  as  diamagnetic  microparticles  while  red  blood  cells  exhibit  diamagnetic  or 

paramagnetic behavior depending on the oxygenation of their hemoglobin. We develop a 

mathematical  model  for  predicting  the  motion  of  blood  cells  in  the  microsystem  that 

takes into account the dominant magnetic, fluidic and buoyant forces on the cells. We use 

the  model  to  study  red/white  blood  cell  transport,  and  our  analysis  indicates  that  the 

microsystem is capable of rapid and efficient red/white blood cell separation.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Magnetophoresis  involves  the  manipulation  of  magnetic  particles  in  a  viscous 

medium using an applied magnetic field [1]. Research in this area has intensified recently, 

with an emphasis on applications in microbiology and biomedicine.    Much of this work 

has focused on the development of microfluidic systems with magnetic functionality that 

can process magnetically tagged biomaterials such as cells, enzymes, antigens, and DNA 

[2,3].  Magnetophoretic  microsystems  are  well  suited  for  bioapplications  because  they 

enable    (i)  fast  reaction  times,  (ii)  the  analysis  and  monitoring  of  small  samples 

(picoliters), and (iii) the integration of  “micro total analysis systems” (µTAS). However, 

while numerious microsystems have been developed for processing magnetically tagged 

biomaterial, relatively little work has been done on the direct magnetophoretic separation 

of blood cells at the microscale. Indeed, few such systems have been reported, despite the 

substantial need for fast, accurate, and inexpensive blood cell analysis [4,5].   

In whole blood, white blood cells (WBC) behave as diamagnetic microparticles, 

while red blood cells (RBC) exhibit diamagnetic or paramagnetic behavior depending on 

whether they are oxygenated or deoxygenated, respectively [6].  Thus, the magnetic force 

on white blood cells is opposite to that on deoxygenated red blood cells.  

In this paper, we present a novel method and a mathematical model for the direct 

and continuous separation of red and white blood cells in plasma. The method involves 

the use of a passive magnetophoretic microsystem that consists of an array of integrated 

soft-magnetic  elements  embedded  beneath  a  microfluidic  channel.  The  magnetic 

 

2

elements, which are magnetized by a bias field, produce a nonuniform field distribution 

that gives rise to a magnetic force on blood cells as they flow through the microchannel 

(Fig. 1). The microsystem is oriented with the fluid flow parallel to the gravitational force, 

and  the  cells  are  separated  perpendicular  to  the  flow.  The  reason  for  this  orientation  is 

that the fluidic and gravitational forces are stronger than the magnetic force, and need to 

be orthogonal to it to enable efficient magnetic separation (Fig. 1c).   

The  mathematical  model  we  develop  predicts  the  motion  of  blood  cells  in  the 

microsystem. It takes into account the magnetization of the soft-magnetic elements, and 

the  dominant  magnetic,  fluidic  and  buoyant  forces  on  the  cells.  We  use  it  to  study  the 

motion of white blood cells and deoxygenated red blood cells, and our analysis indicates 

that the magnetic force is sufficient to separate the two types of cells as they flow through 

the microchannel.  

The cell separation method presented here has significant and distinct advantages 

over  competing  techniques  such  as  centrifuging,  or  magnetophoresis  that  involves 

magnetically  labeld  materials.  First,  blood  cells  can  be  continuously  separated  in  their 

native state, without the need for magnetic tagging. Second, small sample volumes can be 

processed, with efficient cell separation completed within minutes. Third, a high degree 

of  system  integration  is  possible,  which  enables  the  potential  for  a  comprehensive  total 

analysis microsystem (µTAS). Fourth, the microsystem is passive and highly portable. In 

this  regard,  note  that  the  cell  separation  itself  consumes  no  energy,  although  energy  is 

needed to sustain blood flow through the microsystem. For these reasons, the method and 

model  presented  in  this  paper  should  stimulate  and  enable  the  development  of  novel

A.  Equations of motion 

We  develop a model for predicting the motion of blood cells in the microsystem, 

and  then  apply  the  model  to  study  cell  separation.  We  predict  cellular  motion  using

magnetic force is obtained using an “effective” dipole moment approach and is given by

important to note that gravity acts in the +x direction, parallel to the flow (see Figs. 1c 

and 2b).   

B. Magnetic force 

The  magnetic  force  on  a  cell  is  obtained  using  an  “effective”  dipole  moment 

method  in  which  the  cell  is  replaced  by  an  “equivalent”  point  dipole  with  a  moment 

c,effm [7]. The force on the dipole (and hence on the cell) is given by

where 

fµ is the permeability of the transport fluid, and 

aH  is the applied magnetic field

Eq. (5) for a cell in a fluid of permeability fµ and obtain

C. Magnetic field of the magnetized elements 

To evaluate the magnetic force, we need an expression for the applied field. This 

is a superposition of two distinct fields, the bias field biasH , and the field 

eH due to the 

array of magnetized elements,  

H H

However, 

biasH  and 

eH are not both independent. Specifically, 

eH  depends on 

biasH  as it 

is the bias field that magnetizes the elements. Therefore, 

biasH  induces

eH . The bias field 

can be optimized using an analytical formula as described by Furlani [8,9]. Once the bias 

field is known, we can determine

eH , but for this we need a magnetization model for the 

magnetic elements.  

We use a linear magnetization model with saturation to predict the magnetization 

of the soft-magnetic elements. Specifically, below saturation,

The demagnetization factor for a highly permeable (

eχ ≈ ∞ ) long rectangular element of 

width 2w and height 2h that is magnetized parallel to its height can be obtained using 

analytical formulas (see Fig. 2b).  Specifically, both the demagnetization factor  Nd  and 

the aspect ratio of the element

To determine the magnetization 

eM of the elements, we first use Eqs. (11) and (12) to 

obtain  Nd  for a give aspect ratio  p  (see p 191, Table A.2 in reference [11]). Next, we

Once

eH is easily determined. Specifically, the field solution for a long 

rectangular element of width 2w and height 2h that is centered with respect to the origin 

in the x-y plane , and magnetized parallel to its height (along the y-axis as shown in Fig. 

2b) is well known (pp 210-211in reference [10]).  The field components are

In these equations, 

eM  is determined using Eq.  (14).  

The field and force for an array of elements can be obtained from (15) and (16) 

[8,9].    Specifically,  let  Ne  denote  the  number  of  elements  in  the  array,  and  let  n  = 

(0,1,2,3,4,  …,  Ne  -1)  label  the  individual  elements  (Fig.  2b).    Now,

(i.e., the distance from the top of the magnetic elements to the lower edge of the fluid)

E. Blood cell properties 

We  need  the  magnetic  properties  of  white  and  red  blood  cells  to  complete  the 

mathematical  model.  White  blood  cells  (WBCs)  comprise  five  different  kinds  of  cells 

that  are  classified  into  two  groups:  agranulocytes  (lymphocyte  and  monocyte),  and 

granulocytes (neutrophil, eosinophil and basophil) [12,13].  The five different cells have 

different  sizes,  with  diameters  that  range  from  6   µm  to  15  µm.  We  account  for  the 

different 

types  of  white  blood  cells  by  using  average  WBC  properties: 

wbcρ =

1070  kg/m

3

,  wbcR =  5  µm,  and  wbcV  =  524  µm3  [12]. White  blood  cells  exhibit  a 

diamagnetic behavior in plasma, but their magnetic susceptibility is not well known [13]. 

and  

 

 

 

10

In order to determine the feasibility of WBC separation we use a lower bound estimate 

for  the  WBC  susceptibility  as  suggested  by  Takayasu  et  al.,  specifically  we  use  the 

susceptibility  of  water

wbcχ

= −

9.2 10
×

6
−

 (SI)  [13].    This  value  is  consistent  with 

measurements  made  by  Han  and  Frazier  in  which  a  value  of 

wbcχ

≈ −

9.9 10
×

6
−

was 

obtained for WBCs with 5 µm diameters (see Table 1 p 1428 in reference [4]).  Thus, the 

WBC  susceptibility  that  we  use  provides  a  conservative  lower  bound  estimate  of  the 

force, and enables us to determine the feasibility of WBC separation.  

Red  blood  cells  (RBCs),  when  unperturbed,  have  a  well-defined  biconcave 

discoid  shape  with  a  diameter  of  8.5  ±  0.4  µm  and  a  thickness  of  2.3  ±  0.1  µm.  These 

cells  account  for  approximately  99%  of  the  particulate  matter  in  blood,  and  the 

percentage by volume (hematocrit) of packed red blood cells in a given sample of blood, 

is normally 40-45%. For red blood cells, we use 

rbcR = 3.84 µm (hydrodynamic radius), 

rbcV

=

88.4  m

µ

,  and 

3

rbcρ =

its

III. RESULTS 

We use the model developed above to study blood cell motion in the microsystem. 

As a first step, we compute the field due to an array of three magnetized permalloy (78% 

Ni 22% Fe, 

M 8.6 10  A/m

es =

 [10]) elements (Fig. 3).  Each element is 300 mm high, 

300 mm wide, and they are spaced 300 mm apart (edge to edge). Thus, w = h = 150 µm, 

and  these  elements  have  an  aspect  ratio

(p  191,  Table  A.2  in  reference  [11]).

bias

.  This  bias  field  intensity  corresponds  to  a 

flux density of 5000 Gauss, which can be obtained by positioning rare earth permanent 

magnets on either side of the microsystem as shown in Fig. 1.   

The  field  components  Bx  and  B y due  to  the  magnetized  elements  are  computed 

along a horizontal line 60 µm above the elements (i.e. at y = 210 µm) using Eqs. (15) - 

(17)  with N 2

e =  (Fig.  3).  Notice  that 

xB  peaks  near  the  edges  of  the  elements  and 

alternates in sign from one edge to the other, whereas 

yB  obtains its maximum value at 

the center of the elements. 

Next,  we  compute  the  magnetic  force  on  a  deoxygenated  RBC  along  the  same 

horizontal line as above (60 µm above the elements). The component  mxF  acts in the flow 

direction while  myF  acts perpendicular to the flow, and is responsible for cell separation. 

Notice  that  mxF peaks  near  the  edges  of  the  element,  and  changes  assign  across  the 

element  (Fig.  4a).  Thus,  a  deoxygenated  RBC  experiences  acceleration  in  the  flow 

direction as it passes the leading edge of an element, followed by deceleration as it passes 

the  trailing  edge. 

myF  is  downward  (negative)  immediately  above  an  element,  but 

alternates  in  direction  across  an  element,  upward  to  the  left  of  an  element,  downward 

above  an  element,  and  upward  to  the  right  of  an  element  (Fig.  4b).  Therefore,  a 

deoxygenated  RBC  accelerates  upward,  then  downward,  and  then  upward  again  as  it 

 

13

passes  an  element.    Oxygenated  RBC  and  WBC  exhibit  a  similar  behavior,  but  in  the 

opposite direction.  

Lastly,  we  determine  the  feasibility  of  RBC/WBC  separation  by  predicting  the 

motion  of  deoxygenated  RBC  and  WBC  as  they  move  through  the  microsystem.  The 

fluid channel is 120 µm high, 1 mm wide, and 30 mm long, and there are 45 permalloy 

elements  embedded  immediately  beneath  it.  Each  element  is  300  µm  high  and  300  µm 

wide, and they are spaced 300 µm apart (edge to edge). Thus, the magnetic element array 

spans a distance of 26.7 mm along the bottom of the microchannel.   

The cells enter the microchannel to the left of the first element ( (0)x

= -600 µm) 

at  various  initial  heights:  y(0)  =  165  µm,  180  µm,  …,  255  µm.  The  top  of  the  fluidic 

chamber  is  120  µm  above  the  elements  at  y  =  270  µm.  The  average  fluid  velocity  is 

fv

=

0.25 mm/s,

 and  the  cells  enter  the  channel  with  this  velocity.  The  WBC  and  RBC 

trajectories are shown in Fig. 5a and 5b, respectively. The trajectory profiles are irregular 

due to the spatial variation of the magnetic force as described above. Note that the WBC 

and RBC separate before they reach the end of the array.  Specifically, all WBC move to 

the top of the channel, while all deoxygenated RBC move to the bottom.  The separation 

times for the WBCs and RBCs are 60s and 80s, respectively (Fig. 6).  

The  preceding  analysis  demonstrates  the  viability  WBC/RBC  separation.  The 

parameters  used  in  the  analysis  (e.g.  the  dimensions  and  spacing  of  the  magnetic 

elements) were arrived at through an iterative series of simulations, and do not represent 

optimum  values.  However,  the  model  enables  rapid  parametric  analysis,  and  there  are 

 

14

several variables that can be adjusted to optimize performance including the number, size, 

and spacing of the elements, the dimensions of the microchannel, and the flow rate. Thus, 

the  separation  method  is  robust,  and  the  microsystem  holds  significant  potential  for 

numerous biomedical applications.    

IV. CONCLUSION 

We have presented a novel method for the direct and continuous separation of red 

and  white  blood  cells  in  plasma  that  has  numerous  advantages  over  existing  cell 

separation  methods.  The  method  is  implemented  in  a  passive  magnetophoretic 

microsystem  that  can  be  fabricated  using  established  methods  [4,16,17].  We  have  also 

developed a mathematical model for studying blood cell transport at the microscale, and 

have used the model to predict cell separation in the microsystem. Our analysis indicates 

that deoxygenated red blood cells can be separated from white blood cells in plasma, and 

that  efficient  separation  can  be  achieved  within  a  few  minutes.  The  method  and  model 

presented here should stimulate further research into magnetophoretic cell separation, and 

lead 

to 

the 

development 

of 

novel 

cell 

separation  microsystems.

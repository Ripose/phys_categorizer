We  propose a  novel  chirped  structure consisting  of  a  low  index  polymer  core  bounded  by 

modulated  multilayer  claddings,  to  realize  an  optical  field  concentrator  with  virtually  zero 

propagation losses in a wide spectral range, independent of wave polarization. In spite of the 

absence  of  the  total  internal  reflection  mechanism,  properly  designed  multilayer  claddings 

ensure  the  achievement  of  unitary  transmittance  in  a  wide  spectral  range,  including  the 

widely used wavelengths for optical communications. Several cladding geometries obtained 

by varying the thicknesses of the cladding layers are reported and discussed.

1   INTRODUCTION  

 

High-index cores sandwiched by low index claddings are used for conventional optical field 

confinement. In fact, guided modes require total internal reflection (TIR) to achieve optical 

field concentration and propagation. Another way to confine the light flow is offered by the 

use of periodic structures. Light within certain wavelength ranges and wave vector directions 

is  not  allowed  to  propagate  through  these  periodic  structures,  giving  rise  to  photonic  band 

gaps  (PBGs)  [1].  The  well  known ability  of controlling  light  using  photonic crystals  (PCs) 

has  been  exploited  to  demonstrate  a  wide  range  of  integrated  optics  applications.  For 

example, using the external reflection due to dielectric layer interferences, a simple PC, such 

as  a  one-dimensional  arrangement  of  two  different  dielectrics,  can  be  easily  used  as  an 

optical  filter.  Another  intriguing  property  of  these  artificial  materials  is  the  strong, 

anomalous,  geometrical dispersion  derived  by  their  intrinsic  periodicity. Such  a  dispersion, 

which  essentially  depends  on  the  high  index  contrast  [2],  could  be  much  greater  than  the 

normal  chromatic  dispersion  of  many  media,  leading  to  devices  capable  of  enhanced 

efficiencies in the framework of nonlinear optics [3,4], such as second harmonic generation 

[5,6].  If  the  periodicity  of  the  structure  is  broken  by  introducing  one  or  more  defects, 

localized states appear inside the band gap or gaps: light becomes confined in small regions 

of space, reaching high density of modes and exceptionally low group velocity. This property 

may be  exploited in the design of slow light structures [7] and microcavities [1]. Moreover, 

the  Bragg  confinement  of  light  provided  by  photonic  crystals  is  a  suitable  tool  for  light 

propagation,  representing  a  valid  alternative  to  the  total  internal  reflection  (TIR)  effect. 

Hence,  we  are  able  to  divide  light  guidance  mechanism  in  two  different  categories: 

 

2 

traditional high-index core waveguides based on the TIR mechanism and photonic band gap 

waveguides in which light propagates through the low-index core due to the Bragg scattering 

mechanism.  Different  kinds  of  devices  are  based  on  Bragg  scattering,  such  as  Bragg 

reflection waveguides (BRWs) [8], Bragg fibers [9] or photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) [10,11]. 

Different  geometries  of  PBG  fibers,  built  up  by  concentric  rings  [12]  of  alternating  high-

index and low-index layers surrounding a low-index core, were theoretically studied [13,14] 

and  experimentally  demonstrated  [15].  The  fundamental  issues  of  the  coaxial  omni-guide 

structures  are  the  possibility  to  overcome  problems  of  traditional  TIR-based  waveguides, 

such as polarization rotation, pulse broadening or sharp bending. Easy coupling, broadband 

transmission  together  with  optimal  field  confinement,  tuning  of  single-mode  window  and 

frequency  of  zero  dispersion  are  some  of  the  exciting  features  of  waveguides  based  on  the 

Bragg  scattering  mechanism  [13,14].  Photonic-crystal-assisted  waveguides,  having  a  low 

index core bounded by properly designed multilayer stacks, have been recently proposed as a 

coaxial  waveguide  [16]  or  as  a  high-performance  Mach-Zehnder  modulator  [17]  and 

harmonic generator [18].  

In  this  paper  we  propose an  optical field concentrator  operating  as  a  waveguide  in  a much 

wider  spectral  range.  Firstly,  to  show  the  ability  of  confining  light  in  a  low-index  core,  a 

simple  multilayer  periodic  cladding  is  studied  and  discussed.  Secondly,  we  suggest  a  low-

index  polymeric  core  layer  bounded  by  an  aperiodic,  chirped  multilayer  cladding, 

dimensioned  by  laws  which  guarantee  a  uniform  distribution  of  layer  thicknesses  varying 

between a minimum value Lmin and a maximum value Lmax. The latter structure achieves a 

unitary  transmittance  in  a  wide  range  of  wavelengths,  including  all  the  three  optical-fibers 

communication windows. Furthermore, the device acts as a high-field concentrator in the low 

 

3 

index  region  with  virtually  zero  propagation  losses,  provided  material  losses  due  to  linear 

absorption  and  scattering  phenomena  induced  by  fabrication  defects  may  be  neglected. 

Finally,  we  show  that  guided  modes  have  effective  refractive  indices  smaller  than  the 

refractive index of each of the cladding layers.

  LOW-INDEX  CORE  WAVEGUIDING  ASSISTED  BY  1-D 

PHOTONIC CRYSTAL CLADDING 

 

 

A  symmetric  geometry  constituted  by  a  2  µm  thick  core  having  refractive  index  nc=1.6 

(typical  for  polymers)  bounded  by  a  periodic  stack-cladding,  as  sketched  in  Fig.1,  is  first 

studied. Each period is composed by two alternating layers, having refractive indices n1=nc 

and  n2=3.2  (typical  for  AlxGa1-xAs  with  x=0.6  for  λ=1064  nm),  and  the  same  thickness  d. 

This  choice  is  by  no  means  unique  and  it  leads  to  a  simpler  way  to  design  the  transverse 

profile  of  the  structures.  The  Beam  Propagation  Method  (BPM),  in  combination  with  an 

analytical  approach  based  on  mode-matching  at  each  interface,  is  used  to  analyze  these 

structures of finite transverse and longitudinal extent. Measured values of material dispersion 

are also considered in all the simulations [19,20]. The waveguides are excited with a cosine 

field  profile,  corresponding  to  the  fundamental  TE-mode  shape,  placed  in  x=0  and 

propagating along z. The input signal propagates down a one-millimeter-long structure. The 

longitudinal transmittance is shown in Fig.2 for claddings having fixed layers of 150 nm, 180 

nm,  210  nm,  and  240  nm,  respectively.  Propagation  is  allowed  only  in  certain  bands,  as  a 

consequence of the Bragg-mirror behaviour of the lateral multilayer stacks. By varying layer 

thicknesses,  the  transmittance  band  shifts  towards  higher  wavelengths  [17].  If  the  signal 

 

4 

propagates  through  the  transverse  (x  axis)  direction,  the  structure  shows  high-localized 

resonant  states  at  frequencies  which  fall  inside  the  band  gap,  acting  as  a  defective,  one-

dimensional  photonic  crystal.  For  example,  using  150nm  thick  layers,  two  resonant  modes 

appear at  λ=1340 nm and λ=1590 nm.    

3    LOW-INDEX  CORE  ASSISTED  BY  A  CHIRPED  MULTILAYER 

CLADDING 

In  this  section  we  will  show  the  effect  of  the  presence  of  chirped  claddings  on  the 

transmission properties. As shown in Fig.2, the transmission bands red-shift by increasing the 

thickness of each layer, i.e. the period of the cladding. We exploit this interference effect to 

cover  the  band  gap  regions  in  the  transmission  spectrum  in  order  to  realize  a  wide-band 

device  [21],  “including”  more  than  one  period  thickness  in  the  cladding.  This  can  be 

achieved  by  modulating  the  period  thickness  along  the  transverse  direction  between  a 

minimum value and a maximum one, which in all the simulations have been assumed equal 

to  Lmin  =  120  nm  and  Lmax  =  240  nm.  We  start  our  analysis  by  considering  a  linear 

modulation of the type:  

 

 

  

        dn = Lmin + n * ∆          

                  

       (1) 

 

where  ∆  is  the  difference  between  two  adjacent  layers,  dn  is  the  single  layer  thickness  and     

n = 0,1,2…N, so that the first layer nearby the core is the thinnest and the last layer is  the 

thickest.  N+1  is  the  number  of  the  periods  constituting  the  cladding.  Each  period  is 

 

5 

composed by two layers. Once the first and the last layers of the periods have been fixed after 

observing the band pass displacement, the value of ∆ is determined by the choice of N. The 

resulting transmission spectra versus wavelength calculated by using values of ∆ between 8 

nm  and  20  nm  are  plotted  in  Fig.3.  Each  spectrum  is  calculated  using  a  fundamental  TE-

mode-shaped input that propagates one millimeter along the longitudinal direction (z axis). 

The  transmission  coefficient  is  almost  unitary,  reaching  in  the  worst  case  (∆  =20  nm)  the 

value 0.9985 for λ = 1600 nm.  To properly weigh the optical field confinement by varying 

the ∆ value, we introduce the figure of merit (FOM) C defined as follows:

where E is the electric field evaluated after one millimeter of propagation and C is obtained 

by  averaging  out  in  the  operating  frequency  range.  By  changing  the  N  value  we  obtain  a 

trade-off between a wide-band, unitary transmittance, and good field confinement inside the 

core region, as shown in Tab.1:

where  N  is  the  total  number  of  periods  and  T  is  the  transverse  length  of  the  device.  The 

maximum value of C is reached for ∆ = 15 nm. 

The field profiles for the linearly modulated cladding (∆= 15 nm) at  λ=1064 nm (dashed-dot 

line),  λ=1320  nm  (solid line)  and  λ=1550  nm  (dashed line) are  shown in  Fig.4.  Losses  are 

exceptionally  small:  0.009  dB/cm  for  λ=1064  nm  and  0.004  dB/cm  for  λ=1320  nm  and 

λ=1550 nm. 

If  the  beam  propagates  along  the  x-axis,  a  linearly  modulated  structure  is  seen  as  a        

multiple-couple-cavity  system,  giving  several  resonant  modes  across  the  entire    spectrum 

range under consideration (λ = 400 ÷ 1600 nm). 

By imposing the continuity of the fields at each interface, we evaluate the effective refractive 

indices  of  all  the  modes  supported  by  the  structure.  The  multilayer  claddings  operate  as  

mirrors  for  the  light  inside  the  core  region,  because  of  the  Bragg  nature  of  the  multilayer 

structure, thus yielding an effective refractive index of guided modes smaller than the index 

in each of the cladding layers [2-3]. In fact, the effective refractive index of the first mode is 

neff=1.5777  for  λ=1064  nm,  neff=1.5615  for  λ=1320  nm  and  neff=1.4993  for  λ=1550  nm, 

provided no material dispersion is considered. The linearly chirped optical concentrator and 

the others described below are generically able to support multimode propagation. The key 

design  parameter  to  achieve  monomodality  is  the  core  width.  Moreover,  by  analyzing  the 

structure  with  a  finite-element  method  based  commercial  software,  we  verified  that  this 

device has the same behaviour for TE and TM polarization (Fig.5). 

Another  interesting  property  of  these  structures  is  the  relation  between  the  unitary 

transmittance and the period thickness instead of their spatial position into the cladding. To 

 

7 

underline  this  peculiarity,  a  reverse  linearly  modulated  cladding  was  considered  by  using 

relation (1), but in this case the thicker layers are in the neighboring of the core. 

The  transmittance  curve  for  this  cladding  structure  highlights  that  there  are  no  meaningful 

differences between the linearly modulated and reverse linearly modulated claddings in terms 

of  propagation  losses  and  transmission  spectra;  we  notice  also  how  the  lossless  feature  is 

retained reversing the cladding. 

4  ALTERNATIVE CHIRPING LAWS  

To  stress  the  flexibility  of  chirped,  modulated  claddings,  various  modulation  laws  were 

tested, following the relations listed in Tab.2.

GAUSSIAN LAW 

dn = Lmin + gauss(i)* Lmin,   n = 0,1,2…N 

Tab.2: Chirping laws 

The  cladding  governed  by  the  exponential  chirping  law  is  constituted  by  nine  bi-layers 

periods,  where  d0  =  Lmin,  ∂  =  1.5  nm,  n  is  the  order  number  of the  period, as  in  the  linear 

chirping law studied earlier, whose thickness increases starting from the core of the cladding. 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

The  transverse  length  of  this  structure  is  T  =  7.5  µm  (less  than  the  linearly  and  reverse-

modulated claddings).  

Both  the  linear  and  exponential  modulations  of  the  cladding  show  the  same  behavior 

regardless  of  the  spatial  position  of  the  periods:  a  uniform  distribution  of  layer  thickness 

varying  between  Lmin  and  Lmax  within  the  cladding  ensures  zero  propagation  losses  in  the 

spectral  range  of  our  interest.  To  highlight  the  quality  of  the  structure  having  uniform 

distribution of layer thickness, a random law was tested (Tab.2). We considered nine periods 

where n is the period index and the random function gives back a uniformly random value 

between 0 and 1. The total width of the structure depends now on the random function. In the 

case of the binomial chirped structure, the binomial law was obtained by tailoring a 4th order 

binomial,  where  c  is  the  binomial  coefficient.  The  n  subscript  is  the  period  index  and  the 

max(c) function gives back the maximum binomial coefficient, that is 6. The cladding is built 

up with five periods, composed of two layers. The total thickness of the structure is  T = 5.7 

µm, less than that of the aforementioned structures. In this case we do not achieve a unitary 

transmittance  in the  frequency  range  of  our  interest  having  a  non  uniform  period  thickness 

distribution (between Lmin and Lmax) . 

Finally, to achieve the best performance with symmetric modulated claddings the Gaussian 

law was considered. The function gauss(i) gets 9 values carried out by considering a uniform 

distribution in the range [-5,5], with a Gaussian function given by µ=0 and σ = 1/(√2π). The 

total thickness of this device is T = 7.9 µm. As achieved in the other configurations, losses 

are indeed very small: 0.013 dB/cm for λ=1064 nm, 0.008 dB/cm for λ=1320 nm and 0.0001 

dB/cm for λ=1550 nm. As expected, good field confinement is achieved also for the last two 

 

9 

different  modulated  claddings.  For  the  sake  of  clarity,  the  transmittance  spectra  of  all  the 

structures presented in the paper are shown in Fig.6. 

5 CONCLUSION  

A  strong  field  confinement  in  low  refractive  index  media,  such  as  polymers,  is  reached  if 

guiding inside the low-index core is assisted by multilayer claddings. The modulation of the 

multilayer  geometry  allows  us  to  retain  good  field  confinement  in  a  wide  spectral  range 

including  all  the  three  optical-fiber  communication  windows.  The  performance  of  such 

devices in terms of transmission coefficient over a wide spectral range strictly depends on the 

period thickness rather than the spatial distribution of each period within the cladding. The 

confinement properties of these structures, including higher order mode propagation, losses 

and their effective refractive indices were discussed as well.

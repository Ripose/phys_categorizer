ABSTRACT 

We have investigated bound modes in finite linear chains of dielectric particles of various lengths, interparticle spacing 
and particle materials.  Through a unique application of the multisphere Mie scattering formalism, we have developed 
numerical  methods to calculate eigen-optical  modes for various arrays of particles.  These numerical methods involve 
the use of the multisphere scattering formalism as the entries in N×N matrices where N represents the number of particles 
in  the  chain.    Eigenmodes  of  these  matrices  correspond  to  the  eigen-optical  modes  of  interest.    We  identified  the 
eigenmodes with the highest quality factor by the application of a modified version of the Newton-Raphson algorithm.  
We found that convergence is strong using this algorithm for linear chains of up to several hundreds of particles.  By 
comparing  the  dipolar  approach  with  the  more  complex  approach  which  utilizes  a  combination  of  both  dipolar  and 
quadrupolar approaches, we demonstrated that the dipolar approach has an accuracy of approximately 99%.  We found 
that the quality factor Q of the mode increases with the cubed value of the number of particles in chain in agreement 
with  the  previously  developed  theory,  the  effects  of  disordering  of  particle  sizes  and  inter-particle  distances  will  be 
discussed.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

One-dimensional  chains  of  scattering  optical  particles  is  attracting  increasing  interest  because  they  can  be  used  in 
various nano-applications where optical energy is received, transferred and converted on a subwavelength scale.1-3  To 
our knowledge, the first practical nanowaveguide capable of transferring optical energy within a distance of 100 nm was 
developed by Atwater and coworkers2,3 which was formed as a linear chain of spherical silver or gold particles (see Fig. 
1). Excitation of the surface plasmon resonance in a particle at one end of the waveguide causes energy to be transferred 
to all particles in turn through the excitation of plasmon resonances in adjacent particles down the chain. The energy that 
is  transferred  to  the  other  end  of  the  waveguide  stimulates  any  number  of  processes  such  as  the  photoexcitation  of  a 
molecule or a chemical reaction. The efficiency of energy transfer greatly decreases with the length of the waveguide 
due to cumulative energy loss.

Optical  energy  is  also  vulnerable  to  radiative  losses  associated  with  photon  emission  and  absorption  of  light  by  the 
material. Losses due to photon emission can be almost completely suppressed if the energy used for particle excitation 
belongs  to  the  energy  domain  of  guiding  modes.  This  energy  domain  exists  where  the  photon  emission  process  is 
forbidden by the momentum conservation law. In the infinite chain with the period a (Fig. 1), all optical excitations can 
be  classified by  their quasi-momentum  projection  to  the  chain  axis  z, which belongs  to  the domain  (-π/a, π/a).4  If  the 
resonant photon wavevector k=ω/c is less then the maximum excitation wavevector π/a, then two branches of guiding 
modes are formed  

where photon emission is forbidden by the momentum conservation law (see Fig. 1). The criterion ω/c<π/a is equivalent 
to the condition that the interparticle distance a should be less than the resonant wavelength, or

This result is equivalent to the light cone constraint suggested in Ref. [5] and used later in Refs. [6, 7] to study long-
living modes in chains of particles for various applications of interest.    

It is straightforward to satisfy Eq. (2) for metal particles because their plasmon resonance frequencies correspond with 
the visible light spectrum as their wavelengths can be as long as few hundred nanometers with a particle diameter of as 
low  as  30  nm,  which  is  the  minimum  distance  between  particles.  That  is  why  metal  particles  can  be  used  to  build 
waveguides free of radiative losses to transfer optical energy on a subwavelength scale.2,3  

However, all metals characteristically absorb optical energy due to the nature of their conducting electrons.  That is to 
say they have continuous spectrum which can consume arbitrary amounts of photon energy thus strongly reducing the 
energy  transmission  in  nano-waveguides.2,  3    Therefore,  it  may  be  more  convenient  to  use  dielectric  materials  having 
very weak light absorption. Then, instead of relying on surface plasmon resonance, one can make use of Mie scattering 
resonances to form polariton modes where oscillations of material polarizations are coupled with electromagnetic waves. 
According  to  rudimentary  estimates  of  Ref.  [7]  made  within  the  framework  of  the  simple  dipolar  oscillator  model, 
guiding modes satisfying Eq. (2) can indeed be formed in chains of particles made of optical materials like TiO2, ZnO or 
GaAs.8 In contrast with metals, dielectric particles have negligible absorption of light so dielectric particle chains can 
transfer optical energy particularly efficiently.  

Optical  modes,  or  "polaritons,"  are  collective  excitations  created  from  the  superposition  of  material  polarizations  and 
photons.  In  this  paper,  we  will  study  polaritons  formed  within  long,  finite  chains  of  dielectric  spherical  particles 
possessing  the  longest  possible  lifetime  (highest  quality  factor)  and,  for  that  reason,  having  the  greatest  relevance 
regarding energy manipulations using particle chains.  

We  will  investigate  the  optical  excitations  within  a  one-dimensional  chain  of  particles  (Fig.  1)  using  the  multi-sphere 
Mie  scattering  formalism9,  10  which  has  a  distinct  advantage  compared  to  the  standard  finite  difference  time  domain 
(FDTD)  approach11  in  that  the  Mie  scattering  formalism  represents  a  scattering  particle  polarization  generally 
characterized by an infinite number of parameters and a discrete set of multipole moments. Our solution for polariton 
modes is valid everywhere in space; therefore, our result is independent of boundary conditions that critically affect the 
FDTD  method.  As  we  show  here,  the  analysis  of  the  quality  factor  (not  necessarily  field  amplitudes)  of  low  energy 
optical modes for reasonably large refractive indices (nr>2) can be performed using a simple dipolar approach, which 
means that numerical calculations can be performed quickly.  

This  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  Section  2,  we  describe  the  multi-sphere  Mie  scattering  formalism  and  its 
application to the investigation of eigensolutions of Maxwell's equations for the particle chain. In Section 3, the results 
for the quality factor of particle chains using the dipolar approach are presented. We also discuss the numerical results 
for quality factor dependence on the number of particles and the physical nature of obtained dependencies. In addition, 
we consider the effect of particle size disordering on the quality factor. In Section 4, we present our conclusions.  

 
 

 

 

2.  THE MULTISPHERE MIE SCATTERING FORMALISM IN THE STUDY OF 

PARTICLE CHAINS 

The multisphere Mie scattering formalism has been developed to study the scattering of optical waves in aggregates of 
spherical dielectric particles.  In our other work12 for instance, we have used the multisphere Mie scattering formalism9, 
10,  13 to study quality factors of whispering gallery modes in circular arrays of spherical particles.  This formalism uses 
the spherical vector function expansion of solutions to Maxwell’s equations in the frequency domain taken at frequency 
) describing two transverse components with angular 
z. The scattering wave partial amplitudes

on the frequency z of the outgoing wave.

This  approach  is  equivalent  to  setting  the  boundary  condition  equal  to  zero  at  infinity  for  outgoing  waves.  The 
homogeneous equation has a nontrivial solution only at a discrete set of frequencies thus making the determinant of the 
system  equal  zero.  Generally,  these  solutions  have  a  finite  imaginary  part  because  of  the  “dissipative”  boundary 
conditions.  To  make  the  problem  numerically  solvable,  we  have  to  restrict  the  number  of  multipoles  by  some  upper 
maximum index nmax. In this manuscript, we take the most straightforward approach nmax=1, which is equivalent to the 
dipolar  approach.14  A  similar  approach  was  taken  in  Refs.  [8,  15-17]  and  here  we  report  and  discuss  these  results  in 
greater detail.

The  nontrivial  solutions  of  Eq.  (5)  exist  for  a  discrete  sequence  of  eigenfrequencies  za=ωa+iγa.  We  are  interested  in 
systems of finite size where the emission of photons is inevitable so that each eigenmode must possess a finite decay rate 
γa.  

lb1/1

Our  consideration  starts  with  the  analysis  of  Eq.  (5).  This  equation  defines  the  spectral  branch  corresponding  to  Mie 
.  Since  the  second  amplitude  has  a 
resonances  associated  with  the  zeros of  the  inverse  Mie  scattering  amplitude 
resonance at a lower frequency (cf. Ref. [18]) it is of greatest interest to us, which is the reason we will study the modes 
associated with the solution of Eq. (5).  
Following from our estimates for circular arrays,12 the dipolar approach is quite accurate in all cases of interest for the 
linear chain as well since estimates for multipole interactions up to nmax=3 have been considered. We found that if the 
refractive index exceeds 2, then the corrections to the resonance frequency are less than 2%. Since the circular array with 
a large number of particles is quite similar to the long chain of particles, we expect that our conclusions can be applied to 
the particle chain as well. Therefore, we shall restrict our consideration to the dipolar approach. Although our conclusion 
about  the  applicability  of  the  dipolar  approximation  is  valid  for  frequencies,  decay  rates  and  quality  factors,  it  is  not 
necessarily  valid  for  electric  and  magnetic  fields,  which  may  show  singular  behavior  particularly  at  points  where 
particles touch each other.19  

The study will proceed as follows. First we will use Eq. (4b) to find the lowest energy modes in a finite linear chain of 
identical, equally separated dielectric spheres composed of various optical materials of interest. Then we will investigate 
the disordering effect on the quality factor of the most bound polariton modes. We will also describe the method of our 
study  which  incorporates  the  modified  Newton-Raphson  method  in  determining  solutions  to  the  transcendental 
equations.  This  method  is  partially  inherited  from  Refs.  [8, 15],  where  lasing  modes  were  investigated  for  interacting 
dipolar oscillators.  

results from the fact that interactions 

Because of the rotational symmetry of the chain with respect to the rotation around z-direction, the projection m of the 
excitation angular momentum to the z-axis is conserved and m=-1, 0, or 1 can be selected to be constant. Formally, this 
mA 11µ for both centers of spheres j and l belonging to the z-axis are equal to zero if 
m≠µ. Therefore, Eq. (5) splits into three independent modes including two identical transverse t modes with m=1, or -1 
and  polarization  perpendicular  to  the  chain  and  one  longitudinal  (l)  mode  characterized  by  the  angular  momentum 
projection m=0 and polarized parallel to the chain.  Then any mode in the chain of N ordered or disordered spheres with 
centers along the z-axis can be written as

where  M  is  the  matrix  N×N  extracted  from  Eq.  (5).  The  diagonal  elements  of  this  matrix  are  inverse  Mie  scattering 
coefficients and its off-diagonal elements are defined by the matrix A of dipolar interactions between polarizations of 
l
mb 1 . The nontrivial solution of Eq. (7) exists when the 
different spheres.  Vector b represents N expansion coefficients 
matrix M has a zero eigenvalue. Thus, we need to find the value of z which makes one of the eigenvalues of matrix M(z) 
zero and possesses the minimum imaginary part. To use the Newton-Raphson algorithm, we need to choose an initial 
frequency.  This  value  can  be  chosen  as  the  Mie  resonance  frequency  for  the  typical  sphere.  Then  we  can  define  the 
function f(z) as some eigenvalue of the matrix M(z) (cf. [8, 15]) that minimizes the absolute value of the imaginary part 
of z in the next iteration defined in the standard way

The  stable  point  of  this  algorithm  is  realized  when  f(z)=0.  Then  Eq.  (7)  and  consequently  Eq.  (5)  have  a  nontrivial 
solution because the matrix M has one zero eigenvalue. Our method of iteration has been chosen to find the minimum 
eigenvalue  in  the  standard  manner,  although  we  cannot  prove  rigorously  that  it  always  converges  to  the  right 

 
 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

eigenfrequency. Comparison of our method to the simplified situation where the Fourier transform method can be used 
to solve the problem12 supports the validity of our results because we arrive at the same solution using both methods.  

3.  INVESTIGATION OF PARTICLE CHAINS 

We begin our study with the analysis of the quality factor of ordered linear chains of identical, equally spaced particles 
within the framework of the dipolar approach (Eq. (5)), after which we consider the effect of disordering.  

It is clear that the regime of most strongly bound polariton modes is realized when particles are closest to each other. 
This takes place when the distance between the centers of particles is equal to their diameter. Therefore, we can set d=a. 

In numerical  calculations, we  have  chosen  the  interparticle  distance a=2.  Since  mode  frequencies  and  decay  rates  are 
inversely  proportional  to  the  particle  size,  one  can  easily  recalculate  them  for  any  size  a  of  interest.  The  results  are 
presented using the size independent quality factor Q, which is defined as one-half of the ratio of the real and imaginary 
parts of a mode eigenfrequency

Our calculations of the quality factor for different refractive indices and different modes are presented in Figs. 2, 3 and 4. 
Since  there  is  no  difference  between  two  transverse  modes  because  of  the  chain  symmetry,  data  are  shown  for  the 
transverse mode m=1 only. In all materials, quality factors of transverse modes exceed those for longitudinal modes at 
least for the large number of particles.  

Because  GaAs  has  the  highest  refractive  index  of  the  materials  we  studied,  it  is  not  surprising  that  modes  with  the 
highest  quality  factor  are  found  in  linear  chains  of  GaAs  particles.    Accordingly,  its  Mie  resonance  is  at  the  lowest 
frequency so the guiding criterion Eq. (2) is  most easily realized there. One should note that for only 10 particles the 
quality factor of the transverse mode t already exceeds 5000, while the quality factor is over 5×106 for N>70. It is clear 
that optical energy can be guided very efficiently through long chains of GaAs particles.

The  dependence  of  the  quality  factor  on  the  number  of  particles  for  GaAs  is  shown  in  Fig.  2.  It  is  clear  that  both 
longitudinal and transverse modes are bound for GaAs because of its high refractive index nr=3.5. The resonant photon 
wavevector for both modes is less that the maximum polariton wavevector q=π/a=π/2≈1.57, so the guiding criteria Eqs. 
(1), (2) are satisfied for both modes. In Figs. 3, 4 the quality factor dependence on the the number of particles is shown 
for two other materials of interest including TiO2 (rutile phase, nr=2.7) and  ZnO (nr=1.9) respectively. The most bound 
modes  in  TiO2  behave  quite  similarly  to  GaAs.  They  are  both  bound  because  their  resonant  wavelengths  satisfy  very 
well the guiding criterion Eq. (2). Accordingly, the quality factor approaches infinity in the limit N(cid:198)∞. The quantitative 
characteristics  of  the  particle  array  made  of  TiO2  are  given  in  Fig.  4  and  included  into  Table  1  similarly  to  those  for 
GaAs. Still only ten particles are needed to attain the quality factor exceeding one hundred.  

The quality factor behavior is quite different in ZnO possessing the lowest refractive index. The resonant wavelength for 
the  longitudinal  mode  there λ=2π/k=3.97  does  not  satisfy  the  guiding  criterion  Eq.  (2)  at  the  minimum  interparticle 
distance  d=2.  Therefore  all  longitudinal  modes  are  expected  to  be  unbound  within  the  framework  of  the  dipolar 
approach. Note that the wavevector exceeds the threshold by less than 2% in its absolute value. The very weak increase 

 
 

 

 

of the quality factor of longitudinal mode with the number of particles seen in Fig. 4 can be therefore understood as the 
consequence  of  its  small  difference  from  the  threshold  value.  Since  corrections  to  the  transversal  mode  resonant 
wavevector  k  were  estimated  to  be  around  2%12  it  is  not  clear  whether  our  preliminary  conclusion  about  longitudinal 
modes in ZnO would remain valid after more accurate study.  

The data in Figs. 2, 3, 4 are presented in the log-log format because the dependence of the quality factor on the numer of 
particles  can  be  described  by  the  power  law.  This  contrasts  with  the  circular  array  behavior,  where  the  quality  factor 
increases  with  the  number  of  particles  exponentially.9,  7,  17,  12  On  our  opinion  the  losses  are  stronger  in  finite  chains 
because they have sharp ends where the emission of light takes place.

(10) 

found previously in Ref. [8] in all materials except for ZnO, where the mode frequency for the transverse mode is very 
close to its threshold value Eq. (2) so the universal regime Eq. (2) is not probably reached there yet.  The physical nature 
of this dependence has been interpreted based on the analysis of the lifetime of the mode in the finite system near the 
band edge, following the previous work by Dowling and coworkers.20, 21 The main difference between this work and Ref. 
[17] is that here we are using the explicit Mie resonance following Ref. [16], while in Ref. [17] dielectric spheres were 
represented by harmonic oscillators. Therefore the situation is quite similar, but since the justification of Q~N3 law was 
made very schematically in Ref. [17] we give more details here.   

The most bound mode for all systems of interest is realized at the maximum polariton quasi-wavevector q=π/a. This was 
clearly  demonstrated  in  Ref.  [12]  for  circular  arrays,  where  the  modes  are  defined  by  their  conserving  quasi-angular 
momenta  and  the  value  of  quasi-angular  momentum  for  the  most  bound  mode  clearly  corresponds  to  the  maximum 
wavevector.  There  is  no  translational  or  rotational  invariance  in  the  finite  chain,  which  can  permit  us  to  find  exact 
momentum of the mode, but the most bound mode frequencies ω (wavevectors k=ω/c) are nearly identical in circular 
arrays  and  linear  chains  (compare  Tables  in  this  work  and  in  Ref.  [12]).  The  point  q=π/a  is  the  minimum  or  the 
maximum in the polariton energy band (cf. Eq. (1)) defined by the dispersion function ω(q) because of the relationship 
ω(π/a-x)= ω(π/a+x) (cf. Refs. [17, 22]). Therefore the point k=π/a corresponds to the top or the bottom of the energy 
band where the group velocity of the mode has the minimum leading to the maximum in its lifetime in the finite sample 
of the length L.

Figure 4. Quality factor dependence on the number of particles for ZnO ordered linear chains. 

Following Ref. [17] we suggest the toy model to estimate the dependence of that lifetime (and the mode quality factor) 
on the system size L. In this model we consider the quantum mechanical quasistates of the particle with the unit mass 
within the material placed in the domain (-L<x<L) and introducing there the potential energy U0>0. The quantum states 
with the energy E close to the potential minimum inside the material E-U0<<E are used to model the polariton modes 
near the band edge. Calculations performed in the Appendix shows that the quality factor of the mode with the lowest 
energy increase with the size of the system as  (see Eq. (16) in Appendix)

which is equivalent to Eq. (10).  

Finally  we  proceed  to  the  discussion  of  disordering.  In  this  paper  we  report  the  simple  estimate  of  the  maximum 
acceptable disordering necessary  to  reduce  quality  factor  by  the  factor of 10. We  introduced  disorder  in particle  sizes 
generating the random fluctuation in each particle diameter distributed normally with the certain dispersion σ. For the 
sake of simplicity particles were placed along the chain in touch with each other. A characteristic minimum value of σ 
leading to the reduction of the quality factor by the factor of M, such as (5<M<20), was found by probing random values 
of  M  until  the  first  success.  This  crude  method  must  be  quite  sufficient  for  qualitative  characterization  of  disordering 
effect. The dependence of the parameter σ on the number of particles is shown in Fig. 7 for transverse modes in different 
materials.

Figure 5. Acceptable disordering for GaAs and TiO2, calculated assuming that it reduces the quality factor by around factor 

of ten compared to the regular chain of particles.  

According to our crude modeling presented in Fig. 7 the “critical” dispersion σ decreases with the number of particles N 
according to the power law 1/Nb.  This is not surprising because the quality factor increases according to the power law 
with N and the sensitivity of the system to disordering should increase in a correlated manner with increasing the quality 
factor. It is certainly not surprising that the critical disordering is smaller for GaAs, which has larger quality factor. The 
naïve  expectation  of  the  inverse  proportionality  of  the  critical  disordering  and  the  quality  factor  is  definitely  not 
confirmed  by  our  study,  so σ  decreases  with  the  increase  of  N  slower  than  1/Q.  We  cannot  suggest  any  analytical 
relationship between the rates of changes for σ and Q, because we do not have sufficient amount of data at this time. 

4.   CONCLUSION 

In this paper we studied optical modes formed in one-dimensional finite chains of dielectric particles. Our main interest 
was whether such chain can possess the bound modes with the very high quality factors and what is the absolute value of 
the quality factor for particles made of different materials. We examined this question for three materials used in various 
optical applications including GaAs (refractive index nr=3.5), TiO2 (nr=2.7, rutile phase) and ZnO (nr=1.9). According 
to  theoretical  analysis  it  is  possible  to  create  bound  modes  within  the  chain  having  decay  rates  vanishing  with  the 
increase of the number of particles N and we tried to find out whether this can be done using standard optical materials.  

To study optical modes we employed the multisphere Mie-scattering formalism used to find eigensolutions of Maxwell 
equations. We studied quasistates possessing the smallest decay rate or, equivalently, the highest quality factor.  

 
 

 

 

Using the dipolar approximation we demonstrated that the quality factor of most bound polariton modes indeed increases 
with the number of particles within the chain for all three materials of interest approximately as N3. It turns out that the 
most bound mode is the transverse mode with the polarization perpendicular to the circle plane and characterized by the 
quasi-momentum projection on the chain axis q=π/a where a is the period of the chain. The theoretical justification for 
the N3 law has been suggested using the toy model of the modes near the band-edge of one-dimensional finite sample. 
The universal behavior Q~N3 takes place in GaAs and TiO2 having relatively high refractive indices, while ZnO having 
the  refractive  index  nr=1.9  is  near  the  threshold  for  the  formation  of  bound  modes  and  therefore  the  quality  factor 
behavior there is quite non-universal.   

Disordering  in  particle  sizes  and  placements  remarkably  reduces  the  quality  factor  of  the  system  (See  Table  1).  The 
minimum acceptable disordering necessary to reduce the quality factor decreases with the number of particles as 1/Nb 
with the non-universal exponent b, which is however less than the exponent 3 for the quality increase rate.

5.  APPENDIX 

 
We model the quality factor dependence on the number of particles using the mode having the longest life-time, which is 
the  mode  nearest  to  the  band  edge.  The  simplest  model  for  such  mode  can  be  expressed  using  the  one-dimensional 
Schrödinger equation with the potential 

 
U(x) = 
                        0, otherwise 
 
The quasistate with the lowest energy E>U0 can be used to estimate the quality factor as

We let the mass to be equal 1 because it does not influence the quality factor dependence on the size L.  Then one can 
represent the solution for the quasistate at x>0 in the form

The boundary condition is selected as the outgoing wave as it is always supposed for quasistates.23 Due to the symmetry 
of the model, it is sufficient to satisfy the boundary conditions at x = L, where the boundary conditions can be expressed 
as the continuity requirements for the wavefunction and its derivative

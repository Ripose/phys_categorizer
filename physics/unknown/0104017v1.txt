Great Belt of Megalithic Observatories and  
Problem of  a History of the Pole of the World 
 

ABSTRACT 
 

The problem of localization of megalithic memorials  on  the 

Earth surface is investigated. 

It  is  pointed  on  existence  of  Great  Belt  of  megalithic 
observatories  -  of  concentration  of  astronomically  significant 
objects near geographical latitude j

 = 51(cid:176)  N. 

The 

latent 

fundamental  (and  astronomical)  sense 

is 
discussed of this phenomenon - the tendency to functional and 
architectural simplisity, to simmetry of megalithic observatories 
(in view of the Symmetric Mandale. 

It  is  pointed  on  possibility  of  existence  of  other  stretching 
concentrations  -  of  clusters  of  megalithic  observatories  (the  
Great    Belts)    in  connection  with  other  fixed  position  of  the 
Poles of the World (of the Earth rotation) in past.

PROBLEM OF LOCALIZATION  
OF MEGALITHIC STRUCTURES (OBSERVATORIES) 
 

One from the central theme of modern  archaeoastronomy 
(PA, 1974; AA,1993; AC, 1993; AA, 1996; AT, 1996; Atkinson, 
1975; etc.) is the next problem: 

What for people of the past built such huge monuments as 
Stonehenge,  pyramids  in  Europe,  Asia,  America?  What  
purposes The creators of these structures pursued?  Whether 
is casual they are disposed on a surface of the Earth? 

-

theme 

the  actively  working 

The  special    message  for  a  narrow  circle  was  devoted  to 
this 
-  
archeologists  (professors  Shlosser,  Ivanishevsky,  Uta  Berger 
etc.). It was made by author in time of a conference SEAC 98 
("Astronomy and Culture"), taking place in Dublin of August 31 
- September 2, 1998 (Chechelnitsky, 1998a). 

researchers 

Basic  ideas  were  repeated  after  this  in  Dubna  September 
17  on  9  International  conferences  "  Science,    Philosophy, 
Religion"  (Theme  "Eschatology") 
the  report  Physical 
Eschatology: a problem "Space - Earth - Man" - as a problem 
of extremal natural Accidents" (Chechelnitsky, 1998b). 
     Let's discuss some special aspects of this extensive theme. 
 
GREAT BELT OF MEGALITHIC OBSERVATORIES 

in 

 

Two Aspects 
Many  observable  megalithic  structure  (observatories)  are 
characterized,  at 
two  distinguished  special 
circumstances: 

least,  by 

*  Megalithic observatory - as Symmetric Mandale. 
*  Typical (standard) design. 
Known  megalithic  observatories  contain  a  rectangular  of 
astronomically  significant  directions  -  cardinal  directions, 
connected  with  the  Sun  (equinoxes,  solstices)  and  Moon 
(limiting  points  of  rise  and  set  of  "high"  Moon),  inscribed  in 
circle  (of  visiring  points,  megaliths).  Such  nonaccidental  
architecture,  reminding,  we  shall  speak,  Symmetric  Mandale, 
obviously, has also special astronomical sense (Fig.1). 

*  Distinguished latitude. 

6                                                                              Chechelnitsky A.M. 

Known megalithic structures (observatories)  have the 

tendency  to  place in geographical latitude close to 

 ~  50 ‚  52(cid:176) N ~  51(cid:176) N. 

Whether it is casual? 
In  this  connection  it  is  interesting  to  pay  attention  to  the 
following the bibliographic indication of Wood (Wood,  1981, p. 
23)  concerning  of  astronomically  significant    architecture  of 
Stonehenge (Fig.1): 

"...Piter  Newman  has  detected,  that  the  long  sides  of 
fourangle are oriented on the most northern point of set of  the 
"high"  Moon,  and  if  to  look  in  an  opposite  direction  -  at  most 
southern  point  of  it's  rise.  He  has  opened  also  one    more 
surprising fact: four basic stone form fourangle, short and long 
  construct  
sides  are  perpendicular  one  another.  To 
rectangular,  which  sides  mark  solar  and  lunar  directions,  it  is 
possible only at Stonehenge latitude. On other latitudes  would  
be  received parallelogram." 

Discussed aspects of structure and disposition of megalithic 
observatories  from  an  analytical,  astronomical  point  of  view 
occurs  as  interconnected  and  give  occasion  for  the    special  
statement. 

The Suggestion. (Megalithic observatory –  
as Symmetric Mandale; A = j
# The ancient founders of megalithical observatories tried to 
use most simple - symmetric design - rectangular (of cardinal, 
astronomically  significant  directions,  connected  with  the  Sun 
and  Moon),  inscribed  in  a  circle  (of  visiring    points  -  stones, 
megalithes). 

 Symmetry). 

# This case corresponds to the special condition 

where 

A = j

, 

  - latitude of monument (observatory), 

A (and h) - azimuth (and height) of Sun above true  horizon 

at the moment of rise or set. 

Believing, for simplicity, that the seen horizon  coincides 
with  true  (and  then  h  =  0),  we  receive  from  the  standard 
formula of spherical  Astronomy 

cosA(cid:215) cosj
the more simple relation 

(cid:215) cosh = sind  - sinj

Per  day  of summer solstice is valid d  = e , where

  (A=j

observable  allowable  latitude  of  localization  of  megalithic 
observatories not hardly differed from

#  This  zone  of  the  structurally  distinguished  latitudes 
represents everywhere found out in archeological  researches 
the  Great  Belt  of  megalithic  observatories.  It  extends  on  all 
Globe  in  Eurasia  -  from  Atlantic  up  to  Pacific  ocean,  in 
America – from Pacific ocean - up to Atlantic, i.e.  actually has

It  is  interesting  to  pay  attention  also  that  sacral  places  the 
Mongols of epoch Chingiz - khan gravitated to consecrated by 
ancient  legends  areas  (in  area  Orhon).  They  also  lay  at 
latitudes of Great Belt of megalithic observatories. 

In  Western  hemisphere  the  brightest  representatives  of  a 
Great  Belt  -  "Medicine  Wheel"  (Vogt,  1993)  are  disposed  on 
border of USA and Canada. (It is known approximately  135 of 
Medicine Wheel structures. The greatest concentration them is 
observed  in  provinces  Alberta  and  Suscachevan  in  Canada 
and in state Montana in USA) .

Let's assume during the further purposeful researches  will 
be  revealed,  that  megalithic  monuments  have    tendency  to 
discretness  -  to  group  along  any  others  (not    appropriate  to 
latitude 51(cid:176) N) extended zones on a surface of the Earth.

THE PERSPECTIVES OF ANALYSIS  
OF GLOBAL STATISTICS 
 

Attentive  purposeful  study  of  global  statistics  of  megalitic 
monumenus  (observatories)  can  result  to  fundamental,  is 
possible, unexpected conclusions having extreme significance 
not  only 
  histories  of 
civilizations), but   also   for   exact  sciences  -  astrophysics, 
geophysics, cosmology. 

for  anthropology 

(archaeology, 

Within the framework of the concept of the Wave Universe 
and Wave cosmogeonomy [Chechelnitsky, 1980 -1998] we for 
a  long  time  expect  appearance  of  the  new  objective  data 
allowing  reliably  to  verify  interesting  inquests  of  the  theory. 
Follows to hope, that an extensive  material of a human history 
-  still  unsufficiently  investigated,  and  main,  it  is  unsufficiently 
correct  interpreted  within  the  framework  of  exact  sciences,  - 
will  allow  to  come  nearer  to  more  adequate  understanding  of 
evolution of  the Nature and Man.

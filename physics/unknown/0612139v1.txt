We present a simple approximate analytical estimate for self-energy of a charge 

in  the  middle  of  cylindrical  channel  of  a  high  permittivity ε1  in  a  media  of  a  low 

permittivity ε2 (for the cases of infinitely long and comparatively short channels) and 

show  that  this  estimate  is  in  a  good  quantitative  agreement  with  exact  solution  of 

Poisson  equation.  Further,  using  these  estimates,  we  explain  the  observed  a  lower 

conductivity, caused by an increased the self-free-energy for ions, whose diameter is 

by ~1Å less than that of the channel (as compared to ions, whose diameter is equal to 

that of the channel).  

 

 

A pure lipid membrane is virtually impermeable for charges coming from water (having high 

permittivity ε1  ~  80)  because  of  a  low  permittivity  (ε2  ~  2)  of  membrane’s  inner  hydrocarbon 

part, which is ~ 50 Å thick [1]. Low permittivity of the hydrocarbon layer leads to a very high 

(by hundreds kJ/mole) increase in electrostatic energy of an ion in a hydrocarbon environment 

[2].  Therefore,  ions  cross  the  membrane  via  water-filled  channels  formed  by  surrounding 

proteins [1].  

A  problem  of  the  charge  energy  inside  a  channel  has  been  addressed,  and  a  formula  for  its 

potential, using an integral of Bessel function, has been obtained [3]. At this basis, the energy of 

a charge in an infinitely long channel has been calculated as a function of ε2/ε1 and presented as 

a  plot  [2].  Later,  a  numerical  solution  has  been  obtained  for  a  channel  of  finite  length  [4]. 

However,  obtained  solutions  have  rather  complicated  form,  and,  to  our  best  knowledge,  no 

simple  (though  approximate)  equation  to  estimate  the  energy  barrier  experienced  by  a  charge 

into  the  middle  of  the  membrane  channel  has  been  suggested  so  far  (for  the  exception  of  a 

simplified  estimate  that  one  of  us  has  derived  and  published  in  a  textbook  [5]  without  a 

mathematical proof).

Here  we  would  like  to  derive  an  approximate  expression  for  the  energy  of  a  charge  into  a 

channel, and to compare it with precise numerical solution of Poisson equation. 

First, let us consider charge q in an infinitely long cylindrical channel of high permittivity ε1, 

surrounded by a media of low permittivity ε2. It is assumed that the channel has radius a, that the 

charge is positioned on the axis of the channel and has radius b, that a is sufficiently greater than 

b (so that water can penetrate between the ion and the channel’s wall), and that ε1 >> ε2. Our aim 

is to calculate potential ϕ at the surface of the charge and find out the additional energy, which 

the charge acquires in the channel.  

 

FIG. 1: Electric field of a charge in an infinitely long (a) and short (b) cylindrical channel of high 

permittivity ε1,  surrounded  by a media of low permittivity ε2; a is radius  of the channel, 2L = 

2L(ε1/ε2,a)  is  a  critical  channel  length  that  separates  these  two  regimes,  D  is  the  membrane

insulator. 

A picture of the field expansion from the charge can be outlined (Fig. 1) using a well known 

analogy between a flux of force lines of electrostatic field and propagation of electric current: a 

high-permittivity  media  is  an  analog  of  conductor,  and  low-permittivity  media  is  an  analog  of 

Around the charge, electrostatic force lines go at first approximately along radii of the sphere, 

from the charge surface up to the channel wall; this occurs at such distances r, that b > r > a.  

Far  from  the  charge,  at  distances  r  >  L  from  it,  these  lines  again  mostly  go  approximately 

spherically. The critical distance L will be defined later on; but, evidently, L >> a when ε1 >> ε2.  

At  the  intermediate  distances  r  (a  >  r  >  L),  the  force  lines  go  mostly  along  the  channel,

because it has high permittivity, but gradually penetrate in the low-permittivity media (Fig. 1a), 

where the field expands almost cylindrically up to the distance L.  

The rise of potential at the distances b > r > a is  

      δϕb-a = q/ε1b - q/ε1a  

 

The rise of potential at the distances L > r > ∞ is  

δϕL-∞(L)  = q/ε2L = {q/[a(ε1ε2)1/2]}/Z = Φ/Z ; 

 

 

here and below we use Φ = q/[a(ε1ε2)1/2] and Z = (L/a)/(ε1/ε2)1/2 (i.e., L = a(ε1/ε2)1/2 Z ). 

The rise of potential at the distances L > r > a is computed as follows.  
Along  the  channel,  the  electrostatic  field  intensity  is  close  to  2q/ε1a2  at  distances  r  ~  a 

(because here almost all force lines are in the channel, half of them going one direction through 

the  channel’s  cross-section  of πa2,  and  another  half  going  the  opposite  direction  through  the 

cross-section of same size, see Fig.1); and the field intensity is close to q/ε2L2 at distances r ~ L, 
where  the  field  expansion  becomes  spherical  again  [q/ε2L2  must  be  smaller  than  2q/ε1a2,  of 
course; this means that (L/a)2   > ½(ε1/ε2), or Z > 0.51/2]. Thus, the average field intensity in the 
channel’s  region  a  >  r  >  L  is  ~  (2q/ε1a2  +  q/ε2L2)/2,  and  the  total  rise  of  potential  along  the 

channel in this region can be estimated as 

δϕa-L, in channel = [(2q/ε1a2 + q/ε2L2)/2](L - a) = (Φ/Z) (Z2 + ½) (1 – 1/[Z×(ε1/ε2)1/2]) . (3) 

In the low-permittivity media, the perpendicular to the channel electrostatic field intensity is also 
about  q/ε2L2  at  distances  r  ~  L,  where  the  field  expansion  becomes  spherical.  Since  at  smaller 

distances r from the channel’s axis the field expands cylindrically, its intensity is about q/(ε2Lr), 

and the total rise of potential in the region of cylindrical expansion (L > r > a) is 

δϕa-L, perp. to channel = (q/ε2L)ln(L/a) = (Φ/Z) ln[Z×(ε1/ε2)1/2] . 

Since δϕa-L, in channel = δϕa-L, perp. to channel, one can estimate the L = a(ε1/ε2)1/2Z value from equation  

(Z2 + ½) (1 – 1/[Z×(ε1/ε2)1/2])  = lnZ 

 + ½ln(ε1/ε2) . 

This equation has two solutions: 

Z = (ε1/ε2)-1/2   at all ε1/ε2 values 

Z ≈ [½ln(ε1/ε2)]1/2 : another solution that exists at ε1/ε2 > 21/2 only; it leads to a 

        lower potential, and therefore this is the main solution at small ε2. 

These solutions splice at ε1 = 2.35ε2, where ½ln(ε1/ε2) = (ε1/ε2)-1. 

The resulting critical distance L is a at when ε1 ≥ ε2 / 0.5ε1, while at ε2 << ε1 it is

L(ε1/ε2,a)  ≈ a[(ε1/2ε2) ln(ε1/ε2)]1/2 . 

 

 

 

 

  (7) 

Thus, the total potential acting at the charge is  

ϕ  = δϕb-a + δϕL-∞ + δϕa-L, in channel = δϕb-a + (Φ/Z) {ln[Z×(ε1/ε2)1/2] +1}  

 

(8) 

and  the  additional  (as  compared  to  the  bulk  media  with  permittivity ε1)  free  energy  that  the 

charge acquires in the channel is 

∆U = ϕq/2 - q2/2ε1b  = (qΦ/2) [{ln[Z×(ε1/ε2)1/2] +1}/Z - (ε1/ε2)-1/2] .  

(9) 

Thus, the result is:  
∆U = {q2/2a}[1/ε2 -1/ε1] at ε1 ≤ 2.35ε2 ; 

∆U ≈ {q2/[2a(ε1ε2)1/2]} [{ln[Z×(ε1/ε2)1/2] +1}/Z - (ε1/ε2)-1/2], where Z ≈ [½ln(ε1/ε2)]1/2, 
 

at ε1 ≥ 2.35ε2.

Paradoxically, the simplest solution Z ≈ [½ln(ε1/ε2)]1/2, obtained for a large ε1/ε2 ratio, turns out 
to be rather precise also for small ε1/ε2 ratio (provided ε1/ε2 > 21/2), and the ∆U value obtained 
with Z = [½ln(ε1/ε2)]1/2 is close (within percents) to the ∆U value obtained with precise solution 

Z of equation (5) , see Table 1. Also, a strict solution for an infinitely long channel at various 

ε1/ε2 ratios, based either on integrals of Bessel functions (cf. [2, 3]), or on a numerical solution of 

Poisson equation are in a fairly good concordance with the approximate analytical estimate (10), 

see Table 1.

For  a  water  channel  in  a  membrane,  estimate  (10)  should  be  valid  when  the  ratio  of  the 
channel diameter 2a to the membrane thickness D is much less than a/L = [(ε1/2ε2) ln(ε1/ε2)]-1/2 ≈ 

0.12 at ε1 = 80 and ε2 ≈ 2 (which is typical for permittivity of a water-filled membrane channel 

[1]).  Thus,  at  D  ≈  50  Å,  which  is  typical  for  a  membrane  [1],  equation  (8)  is  valid  when  the 

channel diameter 2a is below 6 Å.  

For a wider channel, the force lines do not penetrate into the membrane, go mainly along the

channel and then through bulk water (Fig.1a), and the resulting (cf. equation 3) estimate of the 

additional energy (which is due to the field expansion through the narrow channel) is   

∆Uthick channel  ≈ (q2/ε1a )(D/2a  - 1). 

 

 

 

    (11) 

One can see that this estimate does not depend on ε2 value; the only requirements are that ε2 << 
ε1 and a[(ε1/2ε2) ln(ε1/ε2)]1/2 > D. Numerical solution for a wide channel is given in [5]. 

In  conclusion,  we  should  mention  the  following.  The  above  estimates  (10)  and  (11)  do  not 

depend on the ion radius b, provided the ion is surrounded by water. These estimates and all the 

above  explanations  should  also  hold  when  b  =  a,  and  the  ion  touches  only  either  water  or 

membrane.  However,  if  2b  is  less  than  2a  by  an  angstrom  or  so,  water  molecules  cannot 

penetrate between the ion and the channel wall, and the ion is separated from the wall by a layer 

of vacuum (Fig.2).  

 

FIG.  2:  When  2a  –  2b  <  dS  (dS  being  diameter  of  the  solvent  molecules)  the  solvent  cannot 

penetrate  between  the  ion  and  the  channel  wall,  and  the  ion  is  separated  from  the  wall  by  a 

cylindrical layer of vacuum. 

 

This means that the effective diameter of the channel shrinks from 2a to 2b at a distance of about 
b,  which  increases  ∆U  by  ≈  (q2/ε1b  )(a/b    -  1)  (see  equation  11)  and  explains  why  the  ion 

permeability, which is sufficiently high for ions whose radius 2b = 2a ≈ 3 Å, but decreases by a 

couple of orders of magnitude [1] when 2b ≈ 2a – 1 Å.

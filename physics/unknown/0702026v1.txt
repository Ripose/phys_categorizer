Abstract 

The  stability  and  structures  of  Titanium-doped  Gold  clusters  AunTi  (n=2-16)  are  studied  under 

the relativistic all-electron density-functional calculations. It is found that the most stable structures of 

AunTi clusters with n=2-7 are planar. A structural transition of AunTi clusters from two-dimensional 

to  three-dimensional  geometry  occurs  at  n=8,  while  the  AunTi  (n=12-16)  prefer  gold  cage  structure 

with Ti atom locating at the center. The size-dependence of cluster properties such as binding energy, 

HOMO–LUMO gaps, ionization potentials, and electron affinities have been calculated and analyzed. 

The Au14Ti cluster is found to have special stability, which may be due to the electron shell effects. 

Further calculations are performed to study cluster-cluster interaction between two Au14Ti clusters.

I. INTRODUCTION 

Transition  metal  (TM)-noble  metal  alloy clusters  constitute  an  exciting  field  of  research  due  to 

that  they  present  a  number  of  structures  and  properties,  which  are  different  from  those  of 

corresponding  pure  metals  clusters  and  can  be  controlled  by  size  and  concentration.1-10  Since  a  few 

highly  stable  clusters  having  an  gold-caged  structure  with  large  highest  occupied  molecular  orbital 

(HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gaps have been reported, 11-14 TM-Au binary 

clusters have attracted much attention. 

Experimentally,    Neukermans et al investigated the stability of cationic clusters AunM+ with M 

from  Sc  to  Ni,  by  photofragmentation  experiments.15,16  The  observed  intensity  shown  an  enhanced 

abundance  for  specific  cluster  sizes  and  could  be  discussed  on  the  basis  of  the  jellium  model. 

Photoelectron-spectroscopy  studies  show  that  TM  impurity  atom  has  a  significant  effect  on  the 

electronic  properties  of  gold  clusters.17,18  More  recently,  combined  with  theoretical  work,  Li's 

experiment has demonstrated that for planar MAu6

- and MAu6 (M =Ti, V, Cr) clusters, the transition 

metal  dopant  atom  and  the  Au6  ring  have  a  unique  host-guest  interaction,  giving  rise  to  the  atomic 

magnetism.19 

Motivated by the experimental progresses, theoretical calculations of geometrical and electronic 

structures of the TM doped Au clusters have been performed. The structure and electronic properties 

of  bimetallic  AunZn  (n≤6)  clusters  have  been  studied  with  DFT  calculations.20  Au5Zn+  and  Au4Zn 

clusters were found to have a magic number of delocalized electrons for two-dimensional systems. It 

is  also  found  doping  Au4  cluster  with  Ti  or  Zr  gives  rise  a  magic  cluster  which  can  serve  as 

cluster-assembled  materials.21 First-principle calculations of  AunM+ (M=Sc, Ti, V, Mn Fe, Au;  n≤9) 

indicate  that  the  local  magnetic  moment  of  the  dopant  atom  exhibits  a  pronounced  odd-even 

oscillation with the number of Au atoms, and decreases when the cluster size increases.22 Calculations 

on a single 3, 4d impurity encapsulated in an icosahedral Au12 cage show that the interaction between 

dopant atom and host atoms play an important role in energetics and local spin magnetic moment.23 

Based  on  DFT  study  on  geometric  and  electronic  properties  of  AunM  (M=Ni,  Pd,  Pt;  n≤7),  it  is 

suggested that the catalytic properties will be improved with the doping of transition metal.24

It  is  well  known  that  size-dependent  features  of  gold  clusters,  such  as  stability  and  electronic 

properties are successfully explained by electronic shell model. However, the stability of typical TM 

cluster can often be discussed in terms of shells of atoms, relating the number of atoms needed to form 

a compact symmetric structure to an enhanced stability. In order to understand the interplay between 

electronic and geometric effects in bimetallic clusters, in this paper, using the first-principles method 

based  on  density-functional  theory,  we  study  the  size-dependent  growth  behavior  and  electronic 

properties of AunTi (n=2–16) clusters. In Sec. II, a brief description of the computational methods is 

given.  Results  are  discussed  in  Sec.  III.  The  ground-states,  stabilities,  and  electronic  properties  of 

AunTi (n=2–16) clusters have been investigated. Section IV contains the summary of our conclusions. 

II.COMPUTATIONAL METHODS 

Our  calculations  on  the  geometric  and  electronic  structures  of  AunTi  (n=2-16)  based  upon  the 

spin-polarized relativistic all-electron density functional theory (DFT) using the DMol3 package.25 The 

electron  density  functional  is  treated  by  the  generalized  gradient  approximation  (GGA)  with  the 

exchange-correlation potential parametrized by Perdew and Wang (PW91).26 Geometry optimizations 

are  performed  by  the  Broyden  Fletcher  Goldfarb  Shanno  (BFGS)  algorithm.  Self-consistent-field 

procedures are  done with a convergence  criterion of  10-3  a.u. on  the gradient  and  displacement,  and 

10−5 a.u. on the total energy and electron density. To check the validity of the computational method 

used for the investigation of the AunTi clusters, we first perform the calculation on Au2 and Ti2 dimers. 

The  computed  values  of  bond  length  for  Au2  is  2.49Å  and  for  Ti2  is  1.97Å.  These  results  are  well 

consistent  with  the  experimental  data  of  2.47Å27  and  1.97Å28  for  Au2  and  Ti2,  respectively.  This 

indicates that our approach provides an efficient way to study small clusters. 

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

A. Atomic structures 

We have considered a number of possible structural candidates for each size of AunTi clusters to 

search the lowest-energy configurations. The ground-state geometries of AunTi (n=2-16) clusters and 

several typical stable isomers are presented in Figure 1, and 2, where the impurity atom Ti is shown in 

a white sphere. The differences of the total binding energies between an isomer and the lowest-energy 

 

3

structure are also given.   

Figure  1  shows  the  most  stable  structures  of  AunTi  (n  =2–7)  clusters.  For  Au2Ti,  the 

lowest-energy structure is a linear chain in which Ti atom is at the center. A low-lying isomer almost 

linear  is  found  be  0.01  eV  higher  in  total  energy,  in  which  Ti  atom  is  at  the  apex  and  the  Au–Au 

distance is significantly longer than the Au dimer bond length. For small clusters with 3≤n≤7, AunTi 

adopt  planar  structures  as  their  lowest-energy  geometries.  Au3Ti  has  C2v  rhombus  ground  state 

structures.  In  the  case  of  Au4Ti,  the  most  stable  structure  is  planar  trapezoidal  shaped  (C2v)  with 

impurities centered in the middle of bottom lateral. A planar hexagon with the impurity atoms located 

at the center sites is found to be the lowest energy structure for Au6Ti clusters, which can be derived 

from  the  distorted  pentagonal  isomers  of  Au5Ti.  While  the  most  stable  structure  of  Au7Ti  can  be 

obtained by adding a gold atom to one side of Au6Ti. The ground state structures for Au4Ti and Au6Ti 

accord with the existing DFT results.19,21 

The  first  three-dimensional  (3D)  structure  occurs  at  n=8.  Two  planar  structures  constructed  by 

adding two gold atoms symmetrically on the sides of Au6Ti cluster are found to be 0.292 and 0.760 eV 

higher in energy. Compact geometry (8c) is found to be a metastable structure and 0.742 eV above the 

most  stable  structure.  For  n=9,  several  isomers  are  studied.  The  most  stable  structure  with  D3h 

symmetry  can  be  derived  from  8a  by  capping  a  gold  atom  on  the  top  site  of  Ti  in  Au8Ti.  A  3D 

structure with C3v symmetry and two planar isomers are higher than the present ground-state structure 

by 0.123, 0.282, and 0.898 eV respectively. For Au10Ti, the most stable structure is an uncompleted 

icosahedron with C2v symmetry. The lowest-energy structure of Au11Ti can be obtained by capping a 

gold atom on the top of Au10Ti with 10b structure.   

The structural transition takes place at n=12. The ground-state geometry of Au12Ti cluster is an 

fcc  close-packed  structure  with  the  Ti  atom  in  the  cage  center.  It  should  be  noted  that  Ti  bulk  has 

higher melting temperature than Au. According to theoretical models of surface segregation in binary 

systems the larger atom or constituent with lower melting temperature tend to segregate at the surface. 

Our  result  on  Ti  segregation  is,  therefore,  in  agreement  with  these  theories.  Further  more,  in  our 

calculations  the  Ti–Au  bond  (2.387  eV)  is  stronger  than  the  Au–Au  bond  (2.150  eV)  for 

 

4

corresponding diatomic system. So the Ti atom prefers to locate in the center in order to improve the 

stability of system. Other low-energy isomers such as 12b (C2v) and 12c (D6d) are higher in energy by 

△E  =0.279  and  0.522  eV  respectively.  It  should  be  mentioned  that  previous  studies  shows  that  the 

ground state structures for all of XAu12 (X=W and Mo)11,12 and MAu12

- (M=V, Nb, Ta)13 cluster are a 

perfect TM-centered icosahedron. Here the icosahedral structure with Ti in the center is found to be 

not  favorable  by  0.604  eV  higher  than  fcc  structure.  The  lowest-energy  structure  of  Au13Ti  can  be 

constructed by capping an additional Au atom on the Au12Ti cluster. The low-energy isomers such as 

13b (Cs), 13c (C2v), and 13d (C6v) have higher total energies than the 13a by △E=0.059, 0.217, and 

0.235 eV respectively. 

The  lowest-energy  structure  of  Au14Ti  is  similar  to  those  of  Au14Zr and  Au14Hf,13  in  which  14 

gold  atoms  form  a  hollow  cage  with  D2d  symmetry,  while  the  TM  atom  is  encapsulated  in  the  gold 

cage. Two Au-caged structures with C2v symmetry (14b) and D6d symmetry (14c) are in competition 

with the ground-state geometry, and the relative energy are merely 0.035 and 0.044 eV. A metastable 

isomer (14d) with two Au atoms capping on the icosahedron is above the lowest energy geometry by 

0.112 eV.    For Au15Ti, the lowest energy structure can be viewed as a consequence of replacing the 

top  Au  atom  of  Au14Ti  with  two  Au  atoms.  Three  isomers  are  slightly  higher  in  energy  with 

△E=0.040,  0.101,  and  0.204  eV  respectively.  The  ground  state  structure  for  Au16Ti  is  also  a 

continuation of the structural pattern of n=14 (14a) and n=15 (15c). The structure with Cs symmetry 

can  be  yield  as  an  additional  atom  being  capped  on  Au15Ti  cluster.  It  is  more  stable  over  another 

isomer (16d) with similar geometry (C2v ) by 0.552 eV.   

B. Stabilities and electronic properties 

The stability of these clusters can be discussed on the basis of the binding energy per atom (Eb), the 

second-order  energy  difference  (Δ2E),  Eb  (AunTi)  =  [E  (Ti)  +  n  E  (Au)  -  E  (AunTi)]  /  (n+1),  Δ2E 

(AunTi)=  E  (Aun-1Ti)  +  E  (Aun+1Ti)  –  2  E  (AunTi)],  where  E  is  the  total  energy  of  the  system.  As 

shown in Fig. 2, the binding energy increases monotonically as the size of clusters increases. The little 

peak at n=14 shows the Au14Ti cluster has a higher stability. For Δ2E, being a sensitive quantity that 

characterizes  relative  stability  of  atomic  clusters  as  a  function  of  cluster  size,  show  odd-even 

 

5

staggering at the range of n=2-6 and n=10-16. Notice peaks are found at n=4, 12, and 14, indicating 

that these clusters should be more stable than the clusters with neighboring sizes. Our calculations on 

the stability of Au4Ti show a good agreement with previous theoretical calculations, which Au4Ti was 

predicted to be a magic cluster and can serve as building blocks for cluster-assembled materials.21 For 

the n=12 is the transition size for the formation of Au cage, thus the enhanced stability of Au12Ti may 

be attributed to the geometrical effects. For the four valence electrons of Ti along with the 14 valence 

s electrons of Au atoms in Au14Ti result in a total of 18 electrons, one could suspect that the enhance 

stability of Au14Ti may be due to the closure of electron shell.   

The vertical ionization potential (VIP) is a useful quantity for determining the stability of clusters. It 

is  defined  as  the  total-energy  difference  of  the  neutral  cluster  and  the  ionized  cluster  with  the  same 

geometry as the neutral. The VIP increases from n=3 – 6, then drastically decreases as cluster size and 

shows  an  odd-even  pattern  at  the  range  of  n=8-16.  Au14Ti  is  found  to  have  a  significantly  large 

ionization  potential  than  its  neighboring  clusters.  In  addition,  we  have  also  calculated  the  vertical 

electron affinities (EA) by assuming the geometry for the charged cluster to be the same as the neutral 

one.  The  EA  exhibit  an  approximate  odd-even  oscillation  from  n=5  up  to  16.  Noticeable  peaks  are 

found  at  n=3,  6  and  13,  and  dips  are  found  at  n=4  and  14,  which  indicate  that  closed  electron  shell 

occurred at Au4Ti and Au14Ti. The high EA for Au6Ti may be due to its peculiar structure. For Au13Ti, 

the high electron affinity can be understood that it has 17 valence electrons, one electron less than the 

18 electrons closed shell. Consequently, Au14Ti clusters may have a low electron affinity because of 

the closure of electron shell as addition of one gold atom to Au13Ti cluster.   

The HOMO-LUMO energy gap is another useful quantity for examining the stability of clusters. 

As  is  known,  systems  with  larger  gap  are  less  reactive.  In  Fig.  3,  one  can  find  that  Au4Ti,  Au7Ti, 

Au10Ti  and  Au12Ti  have  a  relative  large  gap  than  their  neighboring  clusters.  Obviously,  the  Au14Ti 

cluster has a significantly large gap beyond 1.40 eV. The calculated values of the ionization potential, 

electron  affinity  and  the  HOMO-LUMO  gaps  for  Au14Ti  along  with  Δ2E  as  discussed  above  are 

clearly  large  enough  for  it  to  qualify  as  magic  clusters.  In  addition  to  Au14Ti  large  HOMO-LUMO 

gaps are found for Au13Ti- (1.34 eV) and Au15Ti+ (1.38 eV) in our calculations, which are comparable 

 

6

to  that  of  Au14Ti.  The  large  HOMO-LUMO  gap  may  be  one  of  the  main  reasons  for  the  enhanced 

stability  of  Au15Ti+  observed  by  previous  experiment  (Ref.  15).  Considering  that  both  Au13Ti-  and 

Au15Ti+  clusters  are  valent  isoelectronic  with  Au14Ti,  one  can  believe  that  the  large  gap  of  these 

clusters could be mainly due to the closure of electron shell.   

C. Cluster dimer 

It  is  believed  that  magic  clusters  can  serve  as  building  blocks  for  nanostructures.  It  has  been 

recognized that the structural identity of the magic clusters in the assembly can be best retained due to 

shell closings of the valence electrons or geometric factors. And these clusters are usually expected to 

interact rather weakly via a van der Waals like mechanism with a very small interaction energy (~0.5 

eV).29 However, MAu4 (M=Ti and Zr) cluster shows anomalous behavior.21 Considering MAu4 have 

an  opened  geometrical  structure,  here  we  calculated  the  interaction  between  two  Au14Ti  clusters  to 

investigate the role of geometry on the interaction. Since the nonspherical shape of the Au14Ti cluster, 

there are many possibilities for the relative orientation of two Au14Ti clusters. Here, we just consider 

three  configurations  as  indicated  in  Figure  5,  apex-apex  (a),  face-face  (b),  and  side-side  (c).  The 

average  cluster-cluster  distance  R  (Å),  cluster-cluster  interaction  energy  Eb  (eV)  and  number  n  of 

Au-Au  bond  between  two  clusters  are  summarized  in  Table.1.  For  configuration  1  (Figure  5a),  the 

cluster  dimer  is  formed  by  apex  to  apex  connections  of  the  Au14Ti  clusters.  The  nearest  atomic 

distance R between the two clusters is 2.636 Å (Table. 1), which is slightly smaller than  the Au-Au 

bond length (2.730 Å) in Au14Ti. However, the calculated cluster-cluster interaction energy is found to 

be  0.746  eV,  which  is  much  smaller  than  2.570  eV  of  Au-Au  binding  energy  in  Au14Ti  cluster.  In 

configuration  2  (Figure  5b),  which  is  constructed  by  face  to  face,  the  clusters  just  undergo  a  little 

geometric  distortion  after  optimization.  The  average  bond  length  (2.686  Å)  between  two  clusters  is 

slightly  larger  than  that  of  configuration  1.  However,  cluster-cluster  interaction  energy  is  unusually 

high  (3.503  eV)  relative  to  the  weak  interaction  in  configuration  1.  In  the  case  of  configuration  3 

(Figure 5c) constructed by side to side, there is significant distortion in the initial configuration during 

the optimization. The average bond length R between two clusters is 2.684 Å and the cluster-cluster 

interaction (4.093 eV) is even stronger than that of configuration 2. As can be seen from Table 1, the 

 

7

cluster-cluster interaction is related to the number of Au-Au bond between two clusters. There is only 

one Au-Au bond between two clusters in configuration 1. However, in the case of configuration 2 and 

3,  there  are  much  larger  number  of  Au-Au  bonds,  which  lead  to  stronger  cluster-cluster  interaction. 

Thus  it  may  be  reliable  to  believe  that  the  relative  orientation  plays  an  important  role  in  the 

cluster-cluster  interaction.  These  calculations  indicate  that  even  these  clusters  that  have  closed 

electronic  shell  structure,  such  as  Au14Ti,  still  interact  very  strongly,  and  react  chemically  with  one 

another to form a new species. They would certainly not retain their individual identities in the way 

that the fullerenes do, when used to generate a nanostructured array. 

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

In summary, we have studied the structures and electronic properties of Ti-doped Au clusters by 

employing  density-functional  theory.  The  stable  geometrical  structures  of  AunTi  (n=2  –  16)  are 

obtained  by  using  the  ab  initio  calculations  with  generalized  gradient  approximation.  The  systemic 

and  detailed  analysis  has  been  carried  out  in  order  to  verify  the  stability  of  AunTi  clusters.  The 

pronounced  character  common  to  △2E,  VIP,  EA  and  the  HOMO-LUMO  gap  at  n=14  suggest  that 

Au14Ti  is  a  magic  cluster.  Further  more,  we  have  carried  out  calculations  to  study  cluster-cluster 

interaction between two magic Au14Ti clusters. Whether the clusters retain their individual identities 

depends on the relative orientation of two clusters.

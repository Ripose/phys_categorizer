Long range beam-beam interactions in PEP-II  

M. E. Biagini  
LNF, INFN, Frascati, Italy 

The PEP-II luminosity upgrade foreseen for the next years requires an increased number of bunches and lower βy* with minor 
modifications to the present Interaction Region (IR2). When increasing the collision frequency the beams separation in IR2 can 
be  an  issue.  A  study  of  the  effect  of  the  parasitic  crossings  for  both  the  head-on  and  horizontal  crossing  angle  options  is 
presented. 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

An  upgrade  of  the  PEP-II  B-Factory  luminosity  to 
values  ≥  3  x1034  cm-2  s-1  is  presently  under  study  [1]. 
This  increase  in  luminosity  requires  higher  currents, 
larger number of bunches and lower values of βy*. This 
last  option  requires  in  turn  that  the  bunch  length  σz  is 
reduced  accordingly  to  avoid  as  much  as  possible  the 
hourglass  effect.  The  option  of  introducing  a  small 
horizontal crossing angle in order to minimize the effect 
of  the  parasitic  collisions  is  presently  under  study.  A 
parametric study of the effect of long range beam-beam 
interactions is presented in this paper. 

2.  PEP-II LUMINOSITY UPGRADE 

The  possibility  to  work  with  a  bunch  pattern  filling 
every  other  bucket  (called  by_2)  is  being  explored  at 
PEP-II. An estimate of the parasitic crossings (PC) effect 
on the linear beam-beam parameter can be very useful to 
evaluate if the introduction of a small crossing angle can 
help  to  decrease  the  PC  effect  on  the  beam-beam 
parameters. 

Two options are presently under study [2]: 
 

a)  head-on  collision  with  improved  vertical  focusing, 
for  lower  βy*,  provided  by  additional  permanent 
magnet  (pm)  material  between  B1  (the  small  pm 
bending  magnet  used  to  separate  the  beams  outside 
the 
focusing 
quadrupole);  

IP)  and  Q1 

first  vertical 

(the 

b)  small  horizontal  crossing  angle  collision,  used  to 
increase the number of colliding bunches with lower 
impact  from  PC.  The  improved  vertical  focusing 
could  be provided  in  this  case  by  substituting 5  B1 
slices with 5 pm quadrupole slices.  

 
A preliminary study of the latter option has shown that 
with  the  present  IR2  layout  the  corrector  strengths  are 
able  to  cope  with  a  crossing  angle  ranging  from  0.  to 
±3.5 mrad, leaving the orbits outside IR2 unperturbed.

would be reduced if the bunch length  could not be 
shortened enough;

horizontal half crossing angle θ, in order to be able 
to choose the smallest angle value providing enough 
separation and smaller PC tune shifts.

this  evaluation  are  listed.  For  sake  of  simplicity  these 
values have been kept constant in all calculations, while 
βy* and σz have been used as free parameters.

3.  CROSSING ANGLE 

 
 
The crossing angle geometry has many advantages: it 
allows  for  a  higher  collision  frequency,  so  that  a  larger 
number of bunches can collide, the beams are “naturally” 
separated  as  soon  as  they  leave  the  collision  point,  so 
there  is  no  need  for  dipoles  close  to  the  IP,  and  the 
beams  can  be  sooner  accommodated  in  two  separate 
rings.  These  are 
the  reasons  why  “factories”,  as 
DAΦNE, CESR and KEK-B, have chosen it.  

However  the  crossing  angle  geometry  has  also  some 

drawbacks.  
• 

• 
• 

luminosity  and  tune  shifts  are  “geometrically“ 
reduced, as will be discussed in section 5; 
larger vacuum chamber aperture is needed; 
the beams  travel  off-axis  in  the quadrupoles, where 
field  quality  is  degraded.  Non-linear  fields  and 
fringing field effects have then to be carefully taken 
into account when modelling the beam trajectory; 
•  with a large crossing angle, highly desirable from a 
synchro-betatron

resulting increase of the beam spot size at the IP and 
a consequently lower luminosity.

In conclusion, we think that the choice to collide with 
or without a crossing angle must be a trade-off between 
the  aforementioned  effects  and  the  PC  effect,  described 
in the following section. It is important to determine the 
minimum  beam  separation  required  in  order  to  have 
acceptable  beam-beam  tune  shifts  at  the  PC  and 
reasonable lifetimes: this sets the choice on the θ value.

4.  PARASITIC CROSSINGS 

When the bunch spacing is reduced the beams travel in 
the same pipe with a smaller separation and can interact 
with  destructive  effects  at  the  PC:  a  distance  between 
beam  cores  of  at  least  10  σx  is  required  at  the  first  PC 
(the  most  harmful)  in  order  not  to  have  the  beam  tails 
seeing each other, with a consequent decrease in lifetime. 
Moreover  the  long  range  beam-beam  interactions  can 
become as important as the IP one and the luminosity is 
degraded.  This  reduction  can  be  estimated  only  by  a 
beam-beam simulation including the PC effect, while the 
PC tune shifts can be computed once we know the beams 
separation at the PC. For the by_2 pattern the first PC in 
PEP-II  is  located  at  0.63  m  from  the  IP.  Each  bunch 
experiences this crossing twice, coming to and from the 
IP.  

The  tune  shifts  due  to  the  PCs  can  be  estimated,  for 

Gaussian beams, by the following formulae [5]:

where  x  and  y  are  the  horizontal  and  vertical  beam 
separation,  N  is  the  number  of  particles  in  the  opposite 
bunch,  γ  is  the  beam  energy.  As  it  is  shown  by  these 
formulae  it  is  just  the  absolute  value  of  the  separation 
that  counts  from  the  beam-beam  point  of  view,  and  not 
the number of σx, which limits the lifetime instead. In the 
following calculations the absolute values of ξx and ξy at 
the PC have been taken.

5.  LUMINOSITY AND TUNE SHIFTS 

Unfortunately there is not only the PC tune shift issue 
to  limit  the  collider’s  performances.  With  a  crossing 
angle we can get rid of the previous problem, with some 
costs  (as  the  pipe  aperture  in  the  IR),  but  another  issue 
arises:  luminosity  and  horizontal  beam  size  degrade 
when introducing the crossing angle. 

The  geometric  effect  of  a  horizontal  crossing  angle  θ 
on  luminosity  and  beam-beam  tune  shifts  needs  to  be 
studied  with  3D  beam-beam  simulations,  however  to 
give a first estimate it can be computed following Refs. 
[6,7]. For the case when γ >> tg(θ/2) the luminosity and 
tune shifts formulae are simply:

with the usual meaning of the symbols. 

These  formulae  are  derived  from  the  formulae  for 
head-on  collision,  by  just  substituting  the  horizontal 
beam size by: 

(
σx

2 + σz

)1 / 2
2tg2 θ/ 2
)
(

 

Then,  the  effect  of  the  crossing  angle  is  to  increase  the 
effective  horizontal  beam  size  by  a  factor  σz  tg  (θ/2). 
Therefore  luminosity  and  the  tune  shifts  are  reduced, 
with  the  horizontal  tune  shift  dropping  faster  than 
luminosity and vertical tune shift.  

As  an  example,  in  Figs.  1  and  2  the  luminosity  as  a 
function of the crossing angle, for different values of the 
βy* and for two values of the bunch length (σz = 9 and 7

mm) is plotted. The hourglass reduction factor has been 
also taken into account [4]. A very small crossing angle, 
smaller  than  ±2  mrad,  has  practically  no  effect  on  the 
luminosity,  while

principle  be  reached  also  with  a  longer  bunch  length  (9

However  strong-strong  beam-beam  simulations  (Cai 
[8],  Ohmi)  taking  into  account  the  crossing  angle  show 
for  PEP-II  parameters  a  more  severe  decrease  in 
luminosity  and  maximum  achievable  tune  shift  at  the 
main IP.  Further studies are needed with different sets of 
parameter to check this point.

6.  WORKING IN A BY_2 PATTERN 

The PEP-II luminosity upgrade is designed with 1700 
bunches,  that  is  a  by_2  bunch  pattern.  We  concentrate 
our  analysis  on  the  1st  PC,  which  is  clearly  the  most 
harmful. 
 

 
The PC tune shifts have been computed as a function 
of  the  βy*  for  different  IR  geometry,  from  head-on 
collision to ±10 mrad crossing angle. In Figs. 5 and 6 the 
LER  and  HER  1st  PC  tune  shifts  are  plotted,  with  βy* 
ranging from 5 to 9 mm and hourglass factor included.

*  

 
The  horizontal  tune  shift  is  clearly  negligible  already 
at the 1st PC, while the vertical one can reach remarkably 
high  values.  Of  course  increasing  the  value  of  the 
crossing angle the tune shifts rapidly decrease. 

To  estimate  more  clearly  how  the  PC  tune  shifts  can 
aggravate the beam-beam interaction, their value for the 
1st PC was also compared to the main IP tune shift. For 
this  purpose  the  main  IP  tune  shifts  were  scaled  by 
decreasing  the  bunch  length  accordingly  so  to  keep  the 
design luminosity constant (3.3x1034 cm-2 s-1), including 
the hourglass aggravating factors.  

 
As an example, in Figs. 7 and 8 the absolute value of 
the  PC  ξy,  normalized  to  the  IP  ones,  is  plotted  for  two 
values  of  the  bunch  length  (9  and  7  mm)  and  for 
different  βy*  values.  Note  that  the  PC  tune  shift 
contribution  has  to  be  counted  twice  since  each  bunch 
experiences  a  PC  collision  on  both  sides  of  the  IP.  The 
impact of the PC collision is of course stronger for lower 
βy*  and  shorter  bunches,  going  up  to  60%  for  βy*  =  5 
mm,  σz  =  7  mm  in  head-on  collision.  In  this  case 
however  even  a  small  ±1  mrad  crossing  angle  could 
reduce the effect from 60% to 40%.

7.  REMARKS AND CONCLUSIONS 

The  introduction  of  a  crossing  angle,  to  increase  the 
number  of  colliding  bunches,  can  reduce  the  strength  of 
the  PC  collisions  but  also  reduces 
the  maximum 
achievable luminosity.  

The PC tune shifts rapidly decrease as a function of the 
crossing angle. However it seems that the introduction of a 
very small crossing angle (≤2 mrad) could be a safe option 
which does not affects too much the luminosity. In fact it 
can decrease the PC effect to less than 10%, still probably 
tunable  by  the  operators  during  delivery  (as  remarked  by 
F.J.  Decker).  Such  a  value  of  the  crossing  angle  is  rather 
easy  to  introduce  in  the  present  PEP-II  IR  design  and 
manageable from the point of view of the present machine 
correctors.  As  a  test,  an  IR  design  with  tunable  crossing 
angle  from  0  to  2  mrad  could  be  implemented  for  the 
future operation with a by_2 pattern at high currents. The 
head-on  collision  can  still  be  an  option  if  the  actual 
luminosity  turns  out  to  be  strongly  affected  by  such  a 
small crossing angle. 

Few  questions  are  still  open:  could  it  be  possible  to 
work  with  a  smaller  number  of  bunches  with  higher 
current  per  bunch  to  get  the  same  peak  luminosity,  with 
the same tune shifts (as suggested by M. Placidi)? Or is it 
wiser  to  accept  a  degraded  luminosity  by  the  crossing 
angle  but  operate  with  a  larger  number  of  bunches  and 
larger total beam current? 

The  key  point  however  is  represented  by  the  bunch 
length: it has to be carefully studied if very short bunches 
(6. to 5. mm) can be obtained with minor modifications to 
the  present  PEP-II  lattices.  In  any  case  analytically  it 
seems that even with a longer bunch length, of the order of 
9  to  7  mm,  it  could  be  possible  to  get  the  design 
luminosity.

Of course beam-beam simulations are the only way we 
have now to answer to these questions. It is mandatory to 
include  the  PC’s  and  the  crossing  angle  in  a  3D  strong-
strong  beam-beam simulation.

Abstract:

This paper examines some of the recent experiments on superluminal propagation.
The meaning of information velocity from the perspective of a digital communication
system is analyzed.  It is shown that practical digital communication systems use
bandlimited signals to transmit information consisting of random bits which cannot
be predicted by looking at previously transmitted bits and that information is not
limited to discontinuous step-functions alone. These random bits are pulse-shaped by
using bandlimited pulse (e.g. gaussian pulse), in a causal fashion (meaning waveform
during any given bit is obtained by convolution of present and past bits with the causal
pulse, but cannot have information about future bits!). If these pulse-shaped random bits
were not considered as information, if somehow the future random bits could be
predicted by, say looking at the shape of the first bit,  then there would be no need for
elaborate communication systems like cellular systems and data modems! We could
transmit the first bit waveform, turn off the transmitter and expect the receiver to
correctly detect all future random bits, which clearly is impossible! It is shown that it is
possible to achieve information velocity greater than speed of light, in media with
zero dispersion and positive index of refraction less than unity in the frequency range of
interest, and of sufficient length to make the time gained during medium transmission in
comparison to vaccum transmission,  more than the duration of several bits. It is shown
that while signal causality is preserved from the perspective of an LTI system, Einstein
causality is not preserved and hence what this means to relativistic causality violations is
analyzed.  It is further shown that in cases where the index of refraction or the group
index is negative, the observed negative shift of the peak of the output pulse with respect
to the input peak is merely due to  the fact that the pulse was predictable.

1. Introduction:

Let us consider the case of a Linear Time Invariant(LTI) system which is characterized
by its causal impulse response h(t). The term causality is used throughout this paper to
indicate signal and system causality, which requires that a signal g(t) or system h(t) is
zero for t<0. Relativistic or Einstein causality, where specified is qualified by the
adjective "relativistic" or "Einstein".

Let p(t) be a causal gaussian input pulse to this system. Gaussian pulse is chosen because
it is both time-limited and bandwidth-limited to a high degree that it can be approximated
to zero outside the range of interest with negligible distortion in either domain. For
example, in the GSM cellular systems8, a time-limited  gaussian pulse is used to shape
the random bits to produce the transmit waveform X(t) which is a random process with
gaussian PSD and is filtered in the receiver using a causal filter in the frequency range of
interest, say 

,and this process introduces negligible distortion in the waveform.

f ≤

0f

Any distortion introduced can be mitigated either by equalization or by simply boosting
up the transmit power if appropriate, to achieve a specified bit error rate(BER). Thus
information is still communicated to the receiver with a specified delay which includes
two components:
1. Processing delay:  this includes pulse shaping, filtering, buffering delays
2. Medium delay: This includes the delay encountered by each frequency component of

the transmit waveform X(t) in 

.If the medium delay is constant in 

f ≤

linear-phase, and the received waveform Y(t) is a delayed version of  X(t). The medium
f ≤ will be the dominant component of the delay of X(t). The medium delay
delay in 
f ≤

0f
 will  have a negligible effect on X(t) because of the fact that the power
0f

outside 

spectral density(PSD) of X(t) which is gaussian has negligible values in 

f >

0f

.

Thus we see that the frequency response of the medium in 
effect on the delay of X(t). If the medium is not linear-phase, which is usually the case in
dispersive wireless channels, then it introduces varying delay(dispersion) for each
frequency component of X(t) in

 , thus distorting X(t) . Again, this distortion can

Let us consider the simple case of a binary phase-shift-keying(BPSK) system. The
transmitted baseband signal X(t) is formed by convolving the random binary impulse
train representing the symbols with the gaussian pulse p(t). We shall analyze BPSK in the
baseband only, using the equivalence of bandpass and lowpass systems, since we can
always shift it to any desired frequency range by multiplying the lowpass signal by the
carrier frequency fc>f0. In general, number of symbols M=2b, where b = number of bits.
For BPSK, one symbol equals one bit. Throughout this paper, we will use the term
"symbol" to mean random binary information for the case of BPSK.

X(t) is shown in the figure below. It is very important to note that, though the waveform
appears "smooth", new random information is present in the peak of every symbol. There
is no way to predict with certainty the value of X(t) during a given symbol duration,
based on the values of X(t) during the past symbols. In other words, during a given
symbol interval, X(t) carries information about present and past bits, but carries no
information about the future bits. This is precisely due to the fact that the system

implemented in Eq.(6) is a causal system, where the output at a given instant does not
depend on future input!

Thus we see that the receiver input Y(t) is a time-shifted version of the transmitter output
X(t), with negligible distortion. The only criterion for the choice of the medium is that the
medium should have zero dispersion, unity gain and a refractive index less than unity and

If  tg>Ts, then we have achieved an information velocity faster than light(FTL), in

future symbols. If tg<Ts, it could be explained by the pulse correlation within the symbol.

In order to compute the bit error rate(BER) of this communication system, we must
include a receive baseband filter hr(t) to filter out out-of-band signal and noise
components. This filter should be chosen such that it has unity gain and approximately
linear phase in the range  
introduces a delay Tf. The output of the receive filter is approximately equal to

 and very good attenuation outside the range. This filter

Thus we see that the output Z(t) is an undistorted, delayed version of the transmitter
output, information is contained in the peak of every symbol and has been
transmitted undistorted at FTL speed and hence information symbols can be detected
with high reliability. The BER performance of this system will have a degradation of
about  10log10(3) = 4.7db compared to the ideal BPSK system, because we have used a

spectral efficiency factor(SEF=bitrate/bandwidth=

times worse than the ideal system, in order to ensure high fidelity of output waveform.
Alternatively, we could use a receive filter with a lower cut-off frequency, thus reducing
noise bandwidth and hence improving BER, but the filter delay will be higher and Z(t)
will have a slightly higher distortion due to intersymbol interference(ISI).

The total processing delay Tp is the sum of pulse-shaping delay(Tps), receive filter
delay(Tf) and miscellaneous delays such as buffering and other filters(Tmisc). If  tg>

Tp+Ts, then we have achieved information velocity greater than speed of light "c",
between points A and D, ignoring the length of transmitter and receiver apparatus.
Note that the definition of information velocity only requires zero dispersion over
the range of interest. The notion of group velocity and group index are not relevant in
the context of this paper and hence not invoked. Even in dispersive media, it is possible
to recover information by distortion compensation techniques.

This means that if first symbol (S1) arrives at the receiver input after transmission in a
vaccum medium, ninth symbol (S9) would appear at the receiver input after transmission
in an inverted medium at the same instant. We have already shown that S1 cannot have
any information about S9 which is in its future, due to the fact that the system is
implemented as a causal system.

Information velocity between A and D= vi= L/(Tm+Tp)=300/(0.9*L/c + 20)=1.087*c

BER performance through the inverted medium equals that of the same system with
vaccum medium and the degradation is less than 0.1 db. BER degradation of the vaccum
system in this example, in comparison to the ideal system is about 3 db. We obtain
BER=

210 − , for a Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR)=9.6 db.

2.2 Points to remember:

1.  Practical digital communication channels such as wireless channels are dispersive
indeed. This causes ISI in the received symbols and the received signal is distorted. This
does not mean that information cannot be recovered. There are two ways to combat ISI.
The first method is to simply increase transmitter power, in appropriate cases, thus
swamping out ISI with higher signal power. The second method is equalization, by
estimating the channel and compensating for the ISI. This introduces additional decoding
delay in the receiver.

2.  When the medium dispersion in the signal frequency range is negligible, the time
gained in the medium increases proportional to medium length. In the example in Sec.
2.1, if L=3000m, tg=1000 ns=100 symbols.  If we use multilevel modulation schemes

such as M-ary QAM1, we can get more number of bits/symbol, thus increasing the total
number of bits gained in the medium.

ω .
We can also increase tg by reducing  n(f) in the signal frequency range, by increasing p

0f =1 GHz,  Ts=1 ns; L=300m, tg=100 ns= 100 symbols! Care should be

We can increase tg by increasing signal bandwidth. In the example illustrated in Sec. 2.1,
if we make 
taken to make sure that the medium dispersion over the signal bandwidth does not cause
severe distortion. As a rule of thumb, if 
 then the resulting
distortion is negligible.

4.  Analog modulation systems:
Analog modulation systems such as Amplitude modulation(AM) and Frequency
Modulation(FM) also carry information, the information being carried by smoothly
varying analog modulating signal m(t), instead of bits. Note that m(t), which could be a
live music or video, is not a deterministic signal, but a random process. If m(t) were not
a random signal, then one could transmit the music for a short duration, turn the
transmitter off and expect the receiver to correctly reproduce the rest of the live music

program, which is clearly impossible! The decorrelation time1 ( d
duration of time is m(t) correlated. Beyond

Regarding the experiment5 done by Dr.Nimtz, transmitting through a barrier Mozart's 40th
symphony at a speed 4.7*c,.  tg is in the order of nanoseconds, which is much smaller
τ for music which should be in the order of milliseconds, hence it is not possible to
than 
prove beyond doubt that FTL information transfer occurred. If the length of the medium
is increased such that the time gained tg> d
clearly shown that FTL information transfer occurred.

3. Negative group velocity experiments:

In experiments demonstrating negative group velocity2,6, it has been argued that this is
due to pulse reshaping mechanism and that no new information is available in the pulse

peak, which is not already present in its weak forward tail. Here another theory is
presented which could also explain the observed negative shift in the pulse peak.

Let us consider a gaussian pulse p(n) which is input to a discrete time LTI system with
causal impulse response h(n), yielding an output signal y(n).

The  frequency response is plotted in the figures in Appendix. Note that the frequency

Thus we see that for the impulse response shown in the above example, the system adds
the input signal to its differentiated version and gives an output which is advanced w.r.to
δ
−
(
the input pulse!  The system 
 is clearly causal, since h(n)=0 for
n<0. The pulse advance is possible because the pulse is correlated within the duration of
the pulse and hence can be approximated to a straight line over a time duration which is
much smaller than pulse duration and can be predicted. It is clear that when n0 becomes
comparable or larger than m0, prediction is no longer possible because 
is
mn
/
0
no longer small and hence the output pulse is distorted heavily. When n0 >m0, if we
convolve p(t) with binary symbols as done before and use a symbol duration Ts=m0,  it is
clear that it is impossible to predict the next random bit, given the present bit!  Hence, in
media with negative group velocity, no FTL information transfer is possible. Note
that for the class of impulse responses as given in this example, extra gain is not required
to assist the observed "superluminal" propagation. Unity gain and negative linear phase
delay over the frequency range of interest are the only requirements.

4. What about violation of Einstein causality?

It has been shown that information can indeed be transmitted FTL in certain media. What
does this all mean to Einstein causality? Can we not use FTL information to travel back
in time and violate causality and create paradoxes? That is an open question at this point.
The author strongly feels that research on superluminal propagation should go ahead
independently irrespective of what it might mean to potential violation of Einstein
causality. It may be that such violations are indeed possible in the natural world and other
mechanisms such as consistent histories and alternate histories hypothesis may kick in.
Or it may be that our interpretation of  the mysterious entity namely, time, is incorrect and
may need to revised.  Time shown by the clock may not represent the true time elapsed
while timing an event and it may contain an extra  component acquired during non-
simultaneous synchronisation mechanism using Einstein synchrony, which if subtracted
from the final clock reading, will eliminate time travel and paradoxes. The author has
strongly argued for this case in a recent paper7, that T' in Lorentz transformation(LT)
must be interpreted differently. The author strongly believes that , irrespective of the
correctness of that paper7, the current paper on superluminal propagation must be
evaluated independently and that it would be an incorrect approach to rule out
superluminal phenomena merely on the basis that it will violate Einstein causality and
upset our common sense notions. In short, superluminal phenomena must be researched
independent of concerns of Einstein causality violations.

5. Conclusion:

It has been shown that FTL information transfer is indeed possible using bandlimited
signals when passed through sufficiently long media with unity gain, a positive index of
refraction less than unity, and zero or low dispersion ,over the signal frequency range.
Information is contained in the peak of the random symbol during a given symbol
duration and information velocity is computed by noting the time spent by the peak
during transmission subject to the constraint that the time gained compared to vaccum
transmission must be greater than a symbol duration. The only constraint is placed on the
refractive index profile over the range of interest.
